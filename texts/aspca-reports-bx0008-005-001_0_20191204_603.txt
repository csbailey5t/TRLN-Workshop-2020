PRESIDENT’S REPORT.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :

In submitting to you the Fifteenth Annual Report of
our Society, the most agreeable duty imposed on me is to
assure you of the continued prosperity and usefulness of the
Institution over which, by your favor, I have the honor to
preside.

The past year has been fruitful of incidents, the treatment of
Which, in its capacity of guardian of the rights of defenseless
animals, has demonstrated again, the Wise and humane policy
«of its creation.

 




 

 

 

 

VIVISECTION.

The Fourteenth Report of the proceedings of the Society,.
announced, it may be remembered, only the introduction of a. ‘
Bill for the suppression of Vivisection in this State.

In compliance with my request, a joint committee of both'
Houses of the Legislature was'appoint'ed, to hear me upon
the subject, and on the evening of the 19th day of February,
1880, I addressed the committee in the new Assembly Cham-
ber, which was also largely attended by members of the‘
Senate and Assembly, along with numerous citizens of Albany... 7

Two leading delegates from this city, representing the Vivi—
section interest, appeared, and were heard in Opposition to?
my address, which had been most attentively listened to
during the two hours, nearly, of its delivery.

The result of this effort to abolish a system of torture on
animals, and demoralization of men, which in the Opinion of‘
foreign and home Physiologists, is at once the most barbarous;
and impotent known to the realms of Science; met the fate,.
which I had already predicted for it.

The prayer of the brute creation for mercy was extinguished
in a unanimous, vote of both Houses, refusing to interfere-
with the torments of experimentation, needlessly, inﬂicted as-
it is claimed, on mute defenceless creatures.

Remembering, however, that the ﬁrst efforts of the Society
met with opposition and ridicule ; I have renewed my labors:
this year in the same direction, and shall continue so to do, so.
long as the right of petition remains a privilege of citizenship-

It has been suggested, that it would be more wise to ask for
a modiﬁcation of the system of Vivisection, rather than its
unqualiﬁed abolition.

With great respect I dissent from this view of the subject.

Vivisection like murder or arson is either right or wrong.
If, it is right to torture a sentient being to death, by all the
methods which science and art can devise, then it is wrong to
restrict that right j; if it be wrong, it follows that instantaneous:

and uncompromising ﬁnality should be insisted 011. If, thr-
practitioner of the so called healing art, ought to be trained to
banish from his heart and conscience, every spark of pity for
the defenceless brute, then the laws of this State should be
expunged from the statute books ; but if civilization be not a
myth, and mercy not a mockery, then the demoralizing, bloody
and remorseless crimes inﬂicted on one half of God’s animated
creatures, should meet with prompt and eternal condemnation
and end.

The enlightened and progressive mind of Europe is awfully
awakened to the portentous meaning of these facts, and the
Western world cannot with safety sanction, even by its silence,
the ceaseless termination of torments, which not only rival the
most ignorant barbarism of our race’s early history; but throw
completely into the shade, all the devilish deeds of a modern
Inquisition, once executed in the name of religion.

I am often admonished by nature’s infallible adviser, that
time is rapidly running away, but so long as physical power,
and constitutional right shall remain to me, I shall continue
to plead in my own humble and imperfect way, the termination
of these wrongs against nature, against reason, and against the
public conscience of America.

OBSTRUGTIVE LEGISLATION.

Another Bill introduced by the Society, last winter, and
which failed of becoming a law, was for the protection of
horses and other animals from constantly recurring con-
ﬂagrations, owing to injudicious storage of them.

It is hardly possible to conceive of a plan more disastrously
certain of producing death in its most horrible form—to wit
by ﬁre, than the one now prevailing in this city, of conﬁning
horses in cellars, and upon the upper ﬂoors of stables. Hun-
dreds of animals thus stored away, are at short intervals,
consumed in horrible agony by the ﬂames; to enable the
rolling stock to be more conveniently housed on the ground
ﬂoor. Scarcely a winter passes without one or more of these

holocausts happening ; While in the suffocating heat of summer,
a prolonged death, down in the dark and airless caverns
beneath rickety old buildings, and sidewalks, is the reward
which man accords to that most useful and faithful friend—
the horse!

To put an end to these needless abuses, I last winter pre-
pared and introduced a bill to the Legislature, under the able
advocacy of Hon. Edward Mitchell, remedying the evils com-
plained of. After it had been slightly amended in committee
of the Assembly, it was passed by that body almost unanimously,
there being only two votes in opposition. With this encouraging
prospect it went to the Senate, and I honored Mr. W. W. Astor
with the opportunity of conferring a lasting beneﬁt on that
noble creature, the horse, by procuring its passage in that
branch of the Legislature, but it seems that gentleman’s
position and inﬂuence, were alike inadequate to moving it out
of the Committee, of which he was a member.

I will not trust myself to give expression to the sorrow and
disappointment I feel, at the treatment and consequent failure
which befel this merciful and unselﬁsh measure, and which
addresses itself to the best instincts of our nature. The Bill
perished in the hands to which it was conﬁded.

I have recently seen a report issued by the Fire Department,
stating that during eight months, 169 horses and cows had
been burned to death, and in one instance, 122 at a time. At the
great ﬁre on Eighth Avenue, about 275 were roasted alive; at
the ﬁre on Seventh Avenue and 42d Street, 70 more shared
the same fate, worth $55,000; at the 53d Street conﬂagration,
43 valuable animals perished.

Now there is no reasonable doubt, that had these poor
animals been stabled upon the ﬂoor on a level with the street,
every one of them would have been saved through the supple-
mented efforts of this Society.

To render such humanity possible, the Bill referred to was
introduced to the Legislature, and if its defeat can be a source
Of gratiﬁcation to any one, there exists ample, though ghastly
occasion for such satisfaction.

 




 

BITLL FIGHTIM i.

During the ﬁfteen years of its existence, this Society has
*never presented to the thoughtful public, greater evidence of
its positive usefulness, than was exhibited last summer, on the
«occasion of an attempt to incorporate among the sports of our
country the hideous pastime of Bull Fighting.

This difﬁcult job was undertaken by a noted Spanish
Torrero, who, as is usual in his own country applied ﬁrst to
the Mayor, for permission to inaugurate the performance; but
that gentleman wisely referred him to this Society.

I prefer not to burden this Report with the details relating
to the ﬁrst attempt to mingle cruelty with the pleasures of our
people and thereby familiarize Americans with the idea of
national retrogression; because they must be well remembered
by most of our citizens by reason of their recent occurrence.

Suffice it to say, that notwithstanding all my discouragements
.to the enterprize, by assuring its projector, that if attempted
:in the modiﬁed form, he proposed, that it would be a certain
ﬁnancial failure—and if conducted in the legitimate manner,
then the laws for the protection of animals would be violated,
and the performance summarily broughtZto a close, he never—
«theless proceeded in his purpose, and erected an arena at
110th Street.

The ﬁrst performance was attended by about 3,000 persons.

My application for a detachment of the police was, as is
usual in all similar cases, promptly and politely complied with,
in accordance with law, and a force of 70 men under command
of that able ofﬁcial, Inspector Thorne, along with a number of
«our own ofﬁcers was early on the ground. ’

The burlesque proceeded to the inﬁnite amusement of the
audience, who ﬁnally feeling themselves insulted by such insipid
amusement, killed the enterprize by the application of that
potent instrument ridicule ; leaving little for the ofﬁcers of the
law to do, but to add their merriment to that of the audience
.at this Spanish defeat.

'A second attempt was made in the presence of some 25 idlers

of the city, and the comedy ended by the sheriff 'seizing all the

money and properties appertaining to the concern; and as if to

render the failure more dramatically complete, a black thunder

cloud the following day in its passage across the city, paused
a few moments to give a cozgi—dc—gmcc to the affair, by nearly
submerging the structure with water, while the lightning
poured down its merciless artillery upon it!

Let no one presume that this comedy possessed no element
of a serious character.

It was the desire and purpose of these semi-civilized

foreigners to establish among us all the barbarous features of"

that degrading sport which familiarizes Spain with the trafﬁc

in human beings, despite the protests of her sister States, and.

almost banishes her from the councils of other nations.

THE OBELISK.

Whatever opinions may exist as to the propriety of transfer-—
ring to the soil and climate of this country the ancient.
monument which Commander Gorringe has so successfully
performed, there can be no doubt that he has given proofs of
the possession of abilities which have attracted the notice of
the whole country, and should commend themselves to the
serious consideration of his oﬁ‘icial superiors. A man who-
exhibits such inﬂexible power of will, skill, and judgment
under the most formidable obstacles, unmistakably establishes:
the fact that the Navy of this country would be greatly the-
gainer by proﬁting by his services in a higher capacity.

It is doubtful whether they who quarried and placed upon
its pedestal that remnant of antiquity, are entitled to more
admiration and honor than are this model sailor and his.
associates, in the unprecedented labor now completed.

In the religion and practices of Egypt, animals occupied a
prominent place. Birds and beasts were Deiﬁed and wor-
shiped, and there is little doubt,'that the general tenderness
of Mohammaden races towards dumb creatures, visible at this
distant day, is owing to that ethical sentiment.

 




 

   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   

11

This fact, along with the desire to transmit to a posterity
which probably will not for thousands of years behold them ;
I asked of Commander (:‘rorring'e to place beneath the mono—
lith, some documents appertaining to the labor and purposes
of this Society.

This request was promptly acceded to by that gallant oﬂicer,
and they are now resting in an ahodo, from whence it is pre-
sumed they Will never be removed, except by the Omnipotent
hand of Time.

PREVENTION OF CRUELTY.

It is impossible to give a record of the number of cases in
which the agents of the Parent Society and its branches
throughout the State of New York have interfered with and
prevented the further perpetration of acts of cruelty upon
defenceless creatures; but some idea may be obtained from
the fact that in the cities of New York and Brooklyn alone, as
far as reports have been received, 1,632 cases called for their
interference.

The animals were employed as follows:

Horses attached to street cars .................................. 2‘12
"’ " stages ...................................... 191
licensed vendor wagons ..................... 3376
expresswagons................ 251
trucks and carts ........................... 210
“ coaches, cabs, and “night owls” ............. 172
Acts of cruelty to cattle, dogs, cats, poultry, etc ................. 196
1,002;

The animals were:
Disabled by reason of lameness ................................ 830
“ “ sickness ................................. 154
“ "’ sores under harness .................... 364
“ “ old age and unﬁtness for further work. . . . 165
Overloaded or overcrowded .................................... 119
Total ...................................... 1,632

ANIMALS DESTROYED.

The services of the agents of the Society were called into
requisition to destroy 1,519 animals, rendered unﬁt for

further use.

Condemned by veterinary surgeons as past recovery ............ 226
Suffering from glanders and farcy .............................. 170
Suffering from diseased feet, resulting from picking up nails, or
permanently injured by railroad tracks ................... 90
Broken legs and dislocated limbs ...... . ........................ 210
Worn out and unﬁt for further use ............................. 300
Suffering from lock—jaw ........................................ 250
Dogs, goats, cats, cows, sheep, and other animals ................ 273

Total ...................................... 1, 519

AMBULANCE AND DERRICK WORK.

The ambulances of the Society were called out on 192
occasions during the year to remove disabled horses from the
streets to the Veterinary hospitals and elsewhere, and the
derrick and slings, made expressly for the purpose, were the
means of rescuing many horses and other animals from excav-
ations into which they had fallen.

BRANCHES AND AGENCIES.

The Society has now 14 Branches and 207 Agencies in the
State of New York, and a large proportion of them report that
cases of wanton cruelty are on the decrease. In some large
cities and towns however, great energy on the part of the
agents is still needed. It is to be regretted that the cause
does not receive the co-operation it deserves from many of the
local magistrates and juries.

LECTURES.

During the past year the President has received many
pressing invitations from different parts of the Union to deliver
lectures, but official business at home has rendered it impos-
sible for him to comply. He, however, lectured before the
Young Men’s Hebrew Associations at Newark and at Williams-
burgh, and assisted at the organization of a branch of the
Society at Saratoga. Invitations from kindred societies at
Turin, and at Halifax, NS, he has been compelled to decline.

SPREAD OF THE WORK THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

It is very gratifying to report that the cause is gradually
spreading. From the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc the civilizing
humanity has taken root, spreading an inﬂuence which cannot

be retarded, and causing to spring up in the minds of thinking
people the necessity of having inscribed on the Statute books
of every State of our country, laws for the protection of unof-
fending animals from the cruelty of man.

During the past year Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana
have joined the Humane Uonfederacy, and have declared that
henceforth cruelty to animals is a crime, and punishment will
be meted out to offenders found Violating the laws enacted for
their protection.

Not to be outdone in this civilizing purpose, Alabama,
Kansas, Nevada, South Carolina and Texas are seeking admit-
tance to the Union, and it is confidently hoped, that ere the
close of the present year, they Will have followed the example
of their sister States.

TRANSPORTATION OF LIVE STOCK.

Notwithstanding the combined efforts of the Parent and
kindred societies, no adequate measures have as yet been
passed by Congress to remedy the evils resulting from the
defective manner of transporting animals by railroad. A
general supervision, however, has been kept up in regard to
the shipment of cattle from this port,and the accommodation:
food, &c., provided for them on board the vessels.

A large percentage of the mortality of cattle carried on
shipboard is owing to exposure to storms, cold, and waves,
when carried on the decks of steamers, and to the crowded
and ill—ventilated space and imperfect ﬁttings between decks.
Accidents of broken limbs, bruises, and other discomforts also
arise from the carelessness and want of humanity on the part i
«of ship owners and shippers. Our ofﬁcers have on many occa-
sions compelled them to provide more room for the animals,
and stronger and better stalls, and improved ventilation.

From J anuary to November, 1880, there arrived at London
and Liverpool from America 135,979 cattle; 68,261 sheep; and
11,496 pigs. The losses at sea during the same period were
5,716 cattle; 1,270 sheep; and 1,807 pigs. One vessel alone
left this port with 510 head of cattle, and only 31 were landed
.alive in London, the remainder having been suffocated at sea,
or wearied out by the perpetual tossing of the ship.

These ﬁgures in a sanitary, humane and ﬁnancial point of
view, suggest how much better it would be, if animals
destined for human food were slaughtered on land and carried
in vast refrigerators on board ships to the place of destination.

A great improvement has, however, we are glad to say, taken
place in the manner of loading cattle and horses on ships
during the past two years. In lieu of the ordinary gang—plank
or platform over which the animals were driven, goaded by
prods, and cruelly beaten with clubs and sticks by the drovers,
.a patent Elevator invented by Mr. H. P. Kirkham, of Wall

street, in this city, and of which we give an illustration, has
been found admirably adapted for the purpose, and it is
commended to all shippers as the best and safest means of
transferring cattle and other animals on shipboard.

‘Ve also give an illustration of “Cattle Fittings” for ship-
board, also introduced by Mr. Kirkham, and now in general
use by the National and other European steam ship lines. It
is a vast improvement on the old plan, and answers as far
as possible to the animals’ comfort and safety while on the
passage.

PUBLICATIONS.

“OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS.”

This Journal, published under the auspices of the Society, is:
now in the eighth year of its existence, and its increasing
subscription list is the best guarantee of its success. During its
publication it has steadily kept in view the cause it advocates,
and in its columns the more important proceedings of the
Society have been given, to the public. Short stories, sketches,
and other interesting miscellany, appropriate to the character
of the paper, have tended largely to increase its circulation, and
make it valuable as a household journal.

Annual Subscription for the paper, ONE DOLLAR.

Ofﬁce of Publication, 687 Broadway, N. Y. City. Geo. Will
Johnston, Editor.

We have also much pleasure in calling attention to the-
following monthly publications issued by sister societies:

“ Our Dumb Animals,” published by the
Massachusetts Society, Boston.

“ The Humane Journal,” published by the
Illinois Society, Chicago-
“The S. P. C. A. Journal,” published by the
Nova Scotia Society, Halifax.
“ The Animals Friend,” published by the
California Society, San Francisco.
“The Humane Appeal,” published by the
Ohio Society, Cincinnati.

“The Animal World,” published by the
Royal Society, London, England.

 

Respectfully submitted,

T. W. HARTFIELD,
Acting Secretary.
