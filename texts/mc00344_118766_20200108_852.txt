Dear Mrs. Coan:

Thank you so much for your recent message
supporting legislation to provide for more humane
treatment of experimental animals.

I certainly feel that animals in laboratories
should be afforded the most humane treatment possi—
ble, and there is evidence to suggest that in some
research programs adequate safeguards are not observed.

 

Of course, it is also necessary to make sure that
vital medical and scientific research is not unnecess~
arily inhibited. Your comments will be made known
to my colleagues on the Committee on Labor and Public
Welfare who will be considering this legislation.

Best wishes.

Very truly yours,

WALTER F. MONDALE

Thank you very much for your recent letter and enclosures
expressing your interest in 5.1071, the bill introduced by Senator
Clark to provide for the humane treatment of animals used in experi-

As you probably know, this bill has been referred to the
Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, but as yet no action
has been scheduled on the legislation. Since I am not a member of
this Committee, I cannot predict just what action will be taken

with regard to reporting the bill. I do want to assure you that I
will certainly give the measure my careful attention if it should
come to the floor of the Senate, keeping in mind the views you have
expressed.

Scarsdale, New‘York

Dear Mrs. Hale:

Thanh you.for your recent communication concerning the National Institutes
of Health.budget and the treatment of laboratory animals.

I have been informed.by the Public Health Service that all of the grants
referred to by the National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare and others were care~
fully reviewed by groups of nonfederal eXpert for scientific merit and relevance to
the missions of the NIH. They consider these grants to have contributed to greater
understanding of physiological processes and to have added to the basic fund of know-

ledge which makes possible the many striking advances to prevent human diseases and
suffering.

I am advised that the Department of Health, Education, andeelfare has been
continuously concerned with maintaining the most appropriate'balance between freedom
of research and proper accountability for use of the public funds; more than 50 major
changes have'been instituted by NIH in policy, procedure, fiscal, organizational and
other arrangements directed toward improved administration of research grants. HEW
has assured me that it'will continue to work for the effective use of appropriated
funds to bring about further advances in the war against disease.

Federal support for medical research which involves the use of laboratory
animals has helped to'bring about a significant reduction in human deaths and suffer-
ing. However, I understand and appreciate the decent concern which you eXpress for
the humane treatment of animals used in experiments and tests. Several'bills to in-
sure this objective were pending in the Senate and the House of Representatives but
none received action prior to adjournment in the 88th Congress and therefore must be
reintroduced in the new Congress. You may be sure that as a member of the Senate
Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, I shall examine all aSpects of legislation in
this area with the greatest concern and sympathy.

Your views on this issue are very much appreciated.

'With‘best wishes,

Thank you very much for writing me.

During the last session of Congress I was
co~an§hor of S- 333; to provide for the humEHE”??eatment
of vertebrate animals used in experiments and tests by
recipients of grants from the United States and by agencies
and instrumentalities of the U.‘S. Government.

1 fully agree with you that animals are entitled to
more humane and decent treatment. I feel that those guilty
of cruelty to animals should be punished in many cases more
severely than the mere imposition of fines.

I am also cemauthor of S. 1701, and you may depend
upon it that we will put forth every effort to obtain the
passage of this legislative preposal to provide for humane
treatment of animals used for experimental purposes.

Dear Mrs. Goodrich:

For several years I have sponsored
measures to alleviate the unnecessary suffering of
animals which has and continues to take place in
some of our medical research laboratories. These
efforts were so strongly opposed by medical
researchers that continued agitation for the same
measures would be futile.

In the belief that some progress, even
though minimal, is more in the interests of the
animals and the research itself than continued
stalemate, I introduced 8. 1087, the Humane Animal
Care Act of 1965. I enclose a copy of my remarks
to the Senate at that time and the text of the
bill.

THE HUMANE ANIMAL CARE C’ITOF
1965

Mrs. NEUBERGER. Mr. President,
legislation is long overdue in the ﬁeld of
the humane treatment of laboratory
animals. However, those who have
pressed for higher standards of animal
care—legislators, researchers, animal
welfare ofﬁcials, concerned private citi-
zens—have discovered that common ac-
cord is as elusive as quicksilver. In past
Congresses I have sponsored measures
which I believed would do much to allevi-
ate the unnecessary suffering which has
and continues to take place in our labora-
tories. But to say that these earlier
legislative attempts to attack the recog-
nized problem have not met with en-
thusiastic support from all interested
quarters would indeed be an understate-
ment, even though I believe many of the
criticisms of the bills unjustiﬁed and
based very often on inaccurate informa-
tion as to the language and intent of the
measures. Medical researchers who use
animals in their laboratories and gov-
ernment departments and agencies who
sponsor such research through grant or
contract have often been too quick to
label any attempt to standardize and
raise existent practices and facilities as
posing a threat to basic research. But
many individuals and organizations ac-
tive in animal welfare work have been
just as quick to shout “sell-out” and
“meaningless” to any proposed statutes
which did not spell out in speciﬁc detail
rigid standards and procedures to be fol-
lowed in all experimentation and testing
involving animals. It is obvious that the
opposition is so strong to the past efforts
by myself and others to legislate in this
area that continued agitation for the
same measures would be futile.

Everyone is in agreement with the
principle that laboratory animals should
receive humane treatment. Differences
arise in deﬁning humane treatment and
in how to establish a mechanism to guar-
antee such treatment. But the existence
of these differences of outlook and prior-
ity ought not to be allowed to preclude
any congressional action to provide hu-
mane treatment for the animals without
hampering medical research for the bene-
ﬁt of the human race. Laboratory ani-
mals continue to be abused. I can no
longer stand by and proclaim the evil
of these abuses, while pressing for re-
forms which I realistically know are,
rightly or wrongly, unacceptable at this
time.

In' the belief that some progress, even
though minimal, is more in the interests
of the animals and the research itself
than continued stalemate, I submit for
appropriate reference the Humane Ani-
mal Care Act of 1965. This bill author-
izes the Surgeon General of the United
States, in conformity with the statement
of policy set forth in the act, to estab-
lish minimum standards for the humane
care and treatment of animals used or
intended for use in research. He is di-
rected to consult with and solicit the
views and recommendations of inter-
ested medical, veterinary science, and
animal welfare organizations, the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, and repre-
sentatives from all departments and
agencies which conduct or support re-
search involving the use of animals.

These minimum standards for animal
housing, handling, and laboratory ex-
periments will become effective at 2—year
intervals beginning in January 1966 and
will become fully effective in January
1974. The purpose of the gradual rais-
ing of the standards of animal care is
to allow time for those companies, in-
stitutions, and Government agencies
concerned with animal experimentation
and testing opportunities to budget ﬁ-
nancial and human resources necessary
to meet the standards. Beginning in
1966 no department or agency of the
Federal Government will make any grant

or enter 'into any contract involving the
use of animals unless certiﬁcation of
compliance with the minimum stand-
ards then in effect is made by those seek-
ing the grant or contract. Unlike some
previous bills, there is no licensing pro-
vision in this act.

Another feature of the act is the estab-
lishment of a reference library Or a clear-
inghouse of information on the use of
animals in research. The library would
contain the record of all animal research
projects conducted by or for the Federal
Government or performed under a Fed-
eral grant. An auxiliary purpose of the
library would be to allow each Federal
department or agency before authorizing
the research to check the ﬁles of the
clearinghouse for the purpose of deter-
mining whether or not similar/ or identi-
cal research had been conducted previ-
ously. Of course, this library would
have no censorship functions. It would
merely provide the granting or contract-
ing authority with the background in-
formation as an aid to determining the
efﬁcacy of a proposal.

N0. 27

Another section of the act authorizes
each department or agency which con-
ducts or supports programs of research
involving the use of animals to conduct
research, training, and to disseminate
information relating to the humane care
and treatment of animals used in re-
search. The purpose of this section is
quite simple. The quality of humane
treatment of animals is directly related
to the quality of the training received by
those handling them. Certainly, those
Government agencies and departments
closely concerned with animal research
ought to be particularly sensitive to the
need for trained animal care personnel,
and this act would enable them to take a
more active role in this area.

Mr. President, I know there are many
Senators who share in the concern over
the standards of our animal care in nec-
essary medical and military research,
and who have been disturbed with the
failure of those most intimately con-
nected with the problem to agree on a
common approach. I have attempted,
through the introduction of this act, to
provide that common ground for initial
minimal action.

I ask unanimous consent that a copy
of the bill be printed in the RECORD at
the conclusion of my remarks and that
the bill might lay on the table for co-
sponsors until February 18.

The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
be received and appropriately referred;
and, without objection, the bill will lie on
the table as requested by the Senator
from Oregon, and will be printed in the
RECORD.

The bill (S. 1087) to authorize the
Surgeon General of the Public Health
Service to establish minimum standards
for the humane care and treatment of
animals used in research, introduced by
Mrs. NEUBERGER, was received, read twice
by its title, referred to the Committee on
Labor and Public Welfare, and ordered
to be printed in the RECORD, as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled, That this
Act may be cited as the “Humane Animal
Care Act of 1965”.

STATEMENT OF POLICY

Sac. 2. It is declared to be the policy of the
United States that living vertebrate animals
used for scientiﬁc experiments and tests
shall be spared unnecessary pain and fear;
that they shall be used only when no other
feasible and satisfactory methods can be
used to ascertain biological and scientiﬁc in-
formation for the cure of disease, allevia-
tion of suffering, prolongation of life, the ad-
vancement of physiological knowledge, or for

 




military requirements; and that all such
animals shall be comfortably housed, well
fed, and humanely handled.

SEC. 3. As used in this Act——

(1) The term “Surgeon General” means
the Surgeon General of the Public Health
Service.

(2) The term “research” means scientiﬁc
research, experimentation, testing, or train-
ing of any kind.

(3) The term “animal" means any live ver-
tebrate animal.

(4) The term “department or agency”
means any department, agency, or instru-
mentality of the United States.

SEC. 4. (a) The Surgeon General shall, in
conformity with the statement of policy set
forth in section 2 of this Act, establish mini-
mum standards for the humane care and
treatment of animals used or intended for
use in research. In establishing such mini-
mum standards the Surgeon General shall
consult with and solicit the views and rec.-
ommendations of interested medical, veteri-
nary science, and animal welfare organiza-
tions, the National Academy of Sciences, and
representatives from all departments and
agencies which conduct or support research
involving the use of animals.

(b) The minimum standards for the hu-
mane care and treatment of animals referred
to in subsection (a) of this section shall
be established by the Surgeon General as
soon as practicable after the date of enact-
ment of this Act, but such standards shall
not become fully effective until January 1,
1974. The Surgeon General shall establish
temporary minimum standards as soon as
practicable after the date of enactment of
this Act which shall become effective on
January 1, 1966; and, thereafter, at two-year
intervals until January 1, 1974, he shall pre-
scribe new and progressively higher tempo-
rary minimum standards which shall be ef-
fective for the period for which they are
prescribed by the Surgeon General.

SEC. 5. No department or agency shall—

(1) make any grant to any person for re-
search which involves the use of animals,
or make any advance or payment under any
such grant; or

(2) enter into any contract with any per-

son to perform research which involves the
use of animals,

unless such person certiﬁes, in such manner
as may be prescribed by the department or
agency concerned, that such person will com-
ply with the minimum standards of care and
treatment for animals prescribed by the Sur-
geon General.

SEC. 6. Any department or agency which
conducts research involving the use of ani-
mals shall comply with the standards of care
and treatment prescribed by the Surgeon
General; and any department or agency
which makes grants for, or contracts for, re-
search involving the use of animals shall de-
termine, through the requirement of annual
reports and on-site inspections, whether
grant recipients and contractors are comply-
ing with the minimum standards of care and
treatment prescribed .by the Surgeon Gen-
eral.

SEC. 7. (a) The Secretary of Health. Educa-
tion, and Welfare is authorized and direct-
ed to establish within the National Institutes
of Health a reference library containing de-
tailed information with raspect to research
involving the use of animals. Such reference
library shall maintain a record of all such

search I conducted by a department or
1aegency, :2; performed under a Federal
grant, and (3) performed pursuant to a
contract with the United States.

(b) Each department and agency shall, be-
fore conducting any research involving the
use of animals and before making any grant
or letting any contract which involves the
use of animals, check the ﬁles of the refer-
ence library provided for under subsection
(a) of this section for the purpose of deterI-l-
mining whether similar or identical researc
has been previously conducted.

SEC. 8. Any department or agency which
conducts or supports programs of research
involving the use of animals is authorized to
conduct research and training, and dissemi-
nate information relating to the humane
care and treatment of animals used in re-

search.

Dear lVlis s Tiemann:

Thank you so much for your kindness in writing
about my accident. Actually, my eye is coming along
nicely.

Thank you also for informing me of your opposi-
tion to appropriations for the National Institutes of Health
which may involve laboratory experimentation with animals.
I have been following with interest separate legislative pro—-
posals which would establish Federal standards of humani—
tarian treatment for animals, and have requested hearings
on these measures in the Senate.

Warm regards.
Sincerely,

Mrs. Stanley Walloch

Dear Mrs. We. .1." loch:

Thank you for your comments on legislation to regulate the use of
animals in medical research.

I have heard.from.many people concerned about needless suffering
of these animals as well as from those concerned about protecting
vital medical research from stifling governmental restrictions.
Valid points have been raised on both.sides of this issue and I
appreciate having opinions for and against Federal control in this
area.

No doubt there will be a number of new bills introduced in.Congress
on this subject. Of course, it is much too early to tell if any

of these measures Will finally come before the Senate. I Will with-
hold final judgment until I have had a chance to give careful consi-
deration to the actual bill to reach the Senate floor. I will make
a decision on this question after fully reviewing the testimony on
both sides.

If legislation can be developed to give protection to experimental
animals from unnecessary suffering, and at the same time, not hamper
necessary medical and scientific research, I will give it my support.

Sincer yours,

W

Dear Irma:

It’s good of you to write in connection
with the judge ship appointment for the
Western District of Wisconsin. What you
have to say makes a great deal of sense,
Irma.

I think that John would make an outstand-
ing judge and he continues to have my support.

With regard to the humane treatment bill,
I'm going to continue to work with my colleagues
in the Senate who are interested in this problem
to try to find a way to put an end to needless
cruelty to laboratory animals.

I'm looking forward to seeing the letter
that you sent to Gaylord. I'm sure that what

you "have to say will be most insteresting.

Sincerely,

/"I.. - / ﬁll) ’

Deer Miss Shaw:

Thank you for telling me of your support for legislation to provide
for the humane treatment of animals used in research and experiments-

tion.

Indeed I agree with you that this is a most desirable aim, and I
would certainly support any leg islet ion which can bring about the
maximum care and comfort of these animals while at the same time

interfering least with the tremendously important research programs
being carried out.

You were kind to flag this one for me.

With best wishes,
