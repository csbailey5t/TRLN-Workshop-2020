Sincerely,

Barbara Gould

Dear Mr. Beers,

Thank you for your letter of february 3rd. The main
criticism.we have, which I am sure can be rectifieﬁ,whs lack
of directional eigns upstairs. Many of the scientistehed
difficulty in locating the exhibits.

In projecting plane for the end of the year we would
like to inquire whether the.animal welfare Institute would be
elihﬂﬂhﬁfor a non-commercial rate for booth space. We are a
non-profit, charitable organiaation. We provide educational
materials free of charge to scientists, both in research facili-
ties and schools. any coneiderhtion in reducing the coat or
bringing these materials to the attention of the members of
AAAS will be appreciated.

If you need further information just let me knowe
Thank you for your help and attention during the last convention.

Sincerely,

Barbara Gould
Publications Secretary

include receiving the freight at our warehouse, delivery to the booth, removal and return of
empty crates and reshipment. For storing empty crates, please place smaller crates inside

larger crates.

Uncrated display materials will be unloaded and loaded at hourly rates, plus the weight charges.
EXHIBITS IN SHERATON HALL — freight door dimensions are 7’3” high x 7'8" wide.
Special arrangements must be made to handle any article exceeding these measurements by
advance notification to us indicating the kind of material involved and its measurements as well
as any other pertinent data.

United shall not be responsible for damage to uncrated materials, materials improperly packed
or concealed damage. United is‘not, and cannot, be responsible for loss or theft of exhibitor’s
materials after same have been delivered to booths. Similarly, they cannot be responsible for
disappearance of materials before they are picked up for loading out of the booth subsequent
to the Show. All bills-of-lading covering shipme’nts which are furnished to United by exhibitors
will be checked at time of actual loading and corrections made where discrepancies exist.
Exhibitors should arrange for outgoing shipments during the Exposition or immediately after
its close. We will assist, at your request, in the preparation of bills of lading. Be sure that your
material has been carefully crated or packed, and prOperly tagged or marked.

In order to expedite removal of materials, we shall have authority without further clearance
with exhibitors, to change designated carriers, if designated carriers do not pick up on time.

All freight charges must be prepaid. Neither we nor the Show Management will pay any ship-
ping charges.

lnsurance — we respectfully suggest that you arrange all-risk coverage; this can usually be done
by “riders” to existing policies, often at no extra cost.

SOME FACTS ABOUT

THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE

o ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES:

The objeCtives of the American Association for the Advancement of Science are to further the work
of scientists, to facilitate cooperation among them, to improve the effecriveness of science in the promOtion
of human welfare, and to increase public understanding and appreciatiOn of the importance and promise
of the methods of science in human progress.

The Association is the world’s largesr federation of scientiﬁc organizations. It is also an association of
more than 133,000 individual scientists and Other persons who are interested in supporting its aims and
activities.

The Association is organized in 20 sections. Each member of the Association may enroll in the section of his
choice and name a second one if he wishes. The affairs of each section are managed by a section committee, which
arranges programs for presentation at AAAS meetings. The sections are: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry,
Astronomy, Geology and Geography, Biological Sciences, Anthropology, Psychology, Social and Economic
Sciences, History and Philosophy of Science, Engineering, Medical Sciences, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences,
Agriculture, Industrial Science, Education, Information and Communication, Statistics, and Atmospheric and

Hydrospheric Sciences.

0 MEMBERSHIP IN THE ASSOCIATION:

Since the time of its organization in 1848, the Association has admitted to membership nor only pro-
fessional scientists but anyone who is interested in the advancement of science. Throughout the Associa-
tion’s 123 years, its membership rolls have carried the names of virtually all the great scientists of this
country. There were 461 charter members at the ﬁrst meeting. Members who have made signiﬁcant con-

tributions to science may be elected as Fellows.

o ANNUAL MEETING:

Each annual meeting of the Association brings together scientiSts from all ﬁelds of science. Some ses-
sions are devored to research reports and discussions in highly specialized scientiﬁc areas. Others are of a
wider, interdisciplinary character or explore relatively neglected areas between scientiﬁc ﬁelds. Evenings
are largely devoted to lectures of general interest. Other features are the AAAS Science Film Program and
the Annual Exposition of scientiﬁc books, apparatus, equipment, and facilities. The AAAS pressroom is
one of the busiest at any U. S. scientiﬁc meeting. Typically some 30 press conferences are held to give
news writers and broadcaSters an opportunity to queStion scientists about scientiﬁc developments of general
public interest. Educational Television has been introduced into the meetings along with outside exhibits
and tours to scientiﬁc and educational establishments for the beneﬁt and participation by registrants.

The Association as a whole, and each of its 20 sections schedule programs. Their sessions, and those of the
participating societies, cover all principal fields of science. Paid registration last year and at recent AAAS meetings

has been:

PROJECTS

The Association has devoted much time and
effort to the ﬁeld of science education—mostly
with ﬁnancial support from the National Science
Foundation.

SCIENCE EDUCATION

The Commission on Science Education was
established in 1962 to direct the Association’s
efforts to improve science education at all levels.

The Commission has produced an experimental
science sequence—Science—A Process Approach
—for grades K through 6; a strategy of evalua-
tion, including testing materials, for this sequence;
and a program for the inservice education of
teachers. Science—A Process Approach is now
published and distributed by the Xerox Corpora-
tion.

In cooperation with the Science Teaching Cen-
ter of the University of Maryland, the Commission
has maintained a Clearinghouse of Information,
which publishes the Report of the International
Clearinghouse on Science and Mathematics Cur—
ricular Developments. Seminars on science for city
school superintendents are cosponsored by the
Commission and the American Association of
School Administrators.

Three conferences held in the fall of 1968 pro-
duced guidelines and recommendations on the
science preparation of elementary school teachers.
Several follow-up conferences for introduction and
discussion of the guidelines will be held in the fall
of 1969.

A major new activity of. the Commission is in
technical education, with special attention being
given to the college-level education of technicians
who work with engineers and physical scientists.

A Newsletter reports Commission activities.

VISITING FOREIGN SCIENTISTS

Each year the AAAS brings about 15 foreign
scientists and mathematicians to the United States
for six-week lecture tours at NSF-supported sum-
mer institutes for secondary school and college
teachers. Visitors give lectures, conduct seminars,
and participate in informal discussions with
teacher participants.

HOLIDAY SCIENCE LECTURES

The Holiday Science Lectures program of the
AAAS provides selected high school students and
teachers in a number of cities throughout the
country with the opportunity to hear science lec-
tures of the highest quality given by eminent scien-
tists. The lectures take place at Christmastime, at
Eastertime, and in June. The purpose of the pro-
gram is to broaden the scientiﬁc horizons of the
audiences and to communicate to them some of
the excitement and inspiration of the scientiﬁc
endeavor.

PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE

AAAS, the American Chemical Society, the
American Institute of Biological Sciences, and the
American Institute of Physics jointly produce a
monthly science column that is sent to some 150
US. newspapers.

SCIENCE SEMINARS

The Association, in collaboration with the
Brookings Institution, presents a series of science
seminars each year for members of Congress,
congressional staff members, and science attaches
of foreign governments. These seminars provide
information on new and important areas of scien-
tiﬁc research, and give the participants an oppor-
tunity for extended informal discussion with out—
standing scientists.

PRIZES, AWARDS, GRANTS
NEWCOMB CLEVELAND PRIZE

The Association’s oldest award, the Newcomb
Cleveland Prize of $1,000, is given each year to
the author of a noteworthy paper, representing an
outstanding contribution to science, presented in
a regular session during the AAAS annual meet-
mg.

AAAS SOCIO-PSYCHOLOGICAL PRIZE

To encourage studies and analyses of social be—
havior which apply the kind of methodology that
has proved so fruitful in the natural sciences, the
AAAS offers an annual prize of $1,000 for a mer-
itorious essay in socio—psychological inquiry.

AAAS-WESTINGHOUSE SCIENCE WRITING
AWARDS

The Association, with support by the Westing-
house Educational Foundation, administers three
awards of $1,000 each for excellence in science
writing in (a) newspapers of large circulation,
(b) newspapers of small circulation, and (c)
magazines. The awards recognize outstanding
writing in the natural sciences and their engineer-
ing and technological applications, excluding the
ﬁeld of medicine.

RESEARCH GRANTS TO ACADEMIES
OF SCIENCE

The 48 state, regional, and city academies of
science that are ofﬁcial aﬂiliates of the AAAS
receive and administer research grants from the
Association ranging from $100 to $1,100.

ORGANIZATION AND OBJECTIVES

The American Association for the Advance—
ment of Science is a private, nonproﬁt organiza-
tion founded in 1848 and incorporated in 1876.
Its objectives are to further the work of scientists,
to facilitate cooperation among them, to improve
the effectiveness of science in the promotion of
human welfare, and to increase public understand-
ing and appreciation of the importance and
promise of the methods of science in human prog—
ress.

The Association is the world’s largest federation
of scientiﬁc organizations. It is also an association
of more than 124,000 individual scientists and
other persons who are interested in supporting
its aims and activities.

The 530—man Council of the AAAS is com-
posed of officers of the Association and represen—
tatives of 293 afﬁliated societies and academies.

A Board of Directors, elected by the Council,
administers Association activities through a paid
professional staff. The 13 Board members include

the President-Elect, President, Retiring President
(who serves as Chairman of the Board), eight
other elected Directors, the Executive Officer, and
the Treasurer.

The Association is organized in 21 sections.
Each member of the Association may enroll in
two sections of his choice. (His selection of sec-
tions does not affect the publications he receives.)
The affairs of each section are managed by a sec-
tion committee, which arranges programs for
presentation at AAAS meetings. The sections are:
Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy,
Geology and Geography, Zoological Sciences, Bo-
tanical Sciences, Anthropology, Psychology, So-
cial and Economic Sciences, History and Philos-
ophy of Science, Engineering, Medical Sciences,
Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Agriculture,
Industrial Science, Education, Information and
Communication, Statistics, and Atmospheric and
Hydrospheric Sciences.

MEMBERSHIP IN THE ASSOCIATION

The Association admits to membership profes-
sional scientists and anyone else who is interested
in the advancement of science. Throughout the
Association’s 121 years, its membership rolls have
carried the names of virtually all the great scien-
tists of this country. Members who have made
signiﬁcant contributions to science may be elected
Fellows. The annual dues are $12.00. All mem-
bers receive Science and the AAAS Bulletin at no
additional cost. Predoctorate graduate students
may join at $13.00 for two years. The fee for
life membership is $250.00 or, for those 60
years of age and over, $175.00.

SCIENCE

SCIENCE, the Association’s weekly journal, is
the nation’s news magazine of science. It has seven
principal features: articles by scientists on topical
developments in different ﬁelds or on science and
public affairs; news and comment—timely reports
by staff members on science and government, edu—
cation, and public policy; short technical research
reports that frequently present the ﬁrst public
report of new ﬁndings; book reviews; letters to the
editor; reports of meetings; and editorials. Rapid
publication of scientiﬁc research ﬁndings makes
SCIENCE one of the best sources for an over-
view of current research in a variety of ﬁelds.
Guide to Scientiﬁc Instruments, published annual-
1y as a special, additional issue of SCIENCE, is
widely used as a purchasing guide and as a basis
for recordkeeping and inventory control.

AAAS members receive SCIENCE every week
as a part of their membership beneﬁts; over
24,000 laboratories, libraries, government agen-
cies, companies, and individuals subscribe directly
(the annual subscription is $12.00).

OTHER PUBLICATIONS

The AAAS BULLETIN is a quarterly news-
letter that reports informally on current AAAS
activities. It is sent 'without charge to AAAS
members and is available to others at $1 a year.

SCIENCE BOOKS: A QUARTERLY RE-
VIEW reviews and evaluates science books for
students in elementary and secondary schools and
the ﬁrst two years of college. Each book reviewed
receives a merit rating and is classiﬁed by the
grade level for which it is appropriate. Over 1,000
new books are reviewed each year. The price is
$6.50 a year. (Special cash price to AAAS mem-
bers, $5.50.)

The AAAS SCIENCE BOOK LIST FOR
CHILDREN is an annotated, classiﬁed list of
nearly 1,300 books suitable for elementary school
libraries and the children’s departments of public
libraries. [1963. $1.50 (paper) New edition, 1970].

The AAAS SCIENCE BOOK LIST FOR
YOUNG ADULTS will be issued in a revised
edition in the fall of 1969. (Price about $8.00.)

The Association has published 89 SYMPOSI-
UM VOLUMES based primarily on symposia pre-
sented at AAAS meetings. The success of AAAS
SYMPOSIUM VOLUMES can be attributed in
large measure to their multidisciplinary character.
Recent titles include Estuaries, -Molecular Mech-
anisms of Temperature Adaptation, Agriculture
and the Quality of Our Environment, Formula—
tion of Research Policies, Folk Song Style and
Culture, and Oceanography (ﬁfth printing). A
price list of available titles will be sent upon re-
quest.

SCIENCE EDUCATION NEWS is a quarterly
publication prepared for scientists in colleges and
universities, government, and industry. It is dis-
tributed without charge to persons who ask to
be placed on the mailing list. SCIENCE EDUCA-
TION NEWS reports on a variety of science edu-
cation activities, such as course content develop-

ment, science teaching centers, and science in
vocational and technical education.

OFFICERS, ORGANIZATION, AND AC4
TIVlTIE-S is published each spring for use by
the Association’s oﬂicers, committee members,

Council members, and afﬁliated organizations.
The 136-page book is available at $2.

Additional AAAS publications are listed on
the following pages.

MEETINGS
THE ANNUAL MEETING

Each annual meeting of the Association brings
together scientists from all ﬁelds of science. Some
sessions are devoted to research reports and dis-
cussions in highly specialized scientiﬁc areas.
Others are of a wider, interdisciplinary character or
explore relatively neglected areas between scien-
tiﬁc ﬁelds. Evenings are largely devoted to lectures
of general interest. Other features are the AAAS
Science Theatre and the Annual Exposition of sci-
entiﬁc books, apparatus, equipment; and facilities.
The AAAS pressroom is one of the busiest at any
US. scientiﬁc meeting. Typically some 30 press
conferences are held to give news writers and
broadcasters an opportunity to question scientists
about scientiﬁc developments of general public
interest. A radio-television room is maintained for
on—the—spot recording or ﬁlming. Registrants for
the annual meeting receive the PROGRAM.

National meetings of the Association are held
each year from December 26 through 31. Future
meetings are scheduled for: 1969———Boston; 1970
—Chica go; and 197 1 —Philadelphia.

DIVISIONAL MEETINGS

The Association’s three geographic divisions
meet annually, the Southwestern and Rocky
Mountain Division in May, the Paciﬁc Division
in June, and the Alaska Division in September.
