REPORT

OF

THE AMERICAN HUM-ANE ASSOCIATION

ON

VIVISECTION IN AMERICA.

MINNEAPOLIS, SEPT. 26, 1895.

 

THE Special Committee appointed at the last annual meeting of

the AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION, for the purpose of
obtaining a census of the opinions regarding Vivisection which gen-
erally prevail, have now completed their task, and beg leave to submit
the following 1eport: -—-

The purpose and scope of thei1 investigations seem to have been
somewhat misunderstood. The Ameiican Humane AssOciation did
not wish to obtain a preponderance of signatures, either for or against
the practice of vivisection. What seemed desirable was an investi-
gation regarding the extent to which different views, particularly
regarding painful experimentation, are now entertained by those
more inﬂuential classes of society whose judgments exert the greater
potency in the formation of public opinion. To do this, it became
necessary to formulate precise statements of Slightly diverging
beliefs, in such form as that they should at any rate touch. this one
question of restriction or non-restriction of eXperiments in pain. It
needs to be remembered that the word “vivisection,” when used as
a synonym for scientific experiments upon animals, may cover op-
erations not more painful than a pin—prick; or, on the other hand,
experiences as excruciating as the imagination can conceive. To ask
simply whether one approves of vivisection. or condemns it, would be
meaningless, unless the definitions given were precise.

Three leading views regarding the practice of vivisection may be
easily recognized: ——

I 1. Its total condemnatiOn because of tendency to cruelty.
.ItS restriction within certain limits.

3. Its approval without any other restraint than the will of the

experimente1 himself.

 




 

    

  

REPORT OF THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION

The second view, however, is capable of considerable subdivision.
One person may favor vivisection provided it be limited to absolutely
painless experiments. Another would not condemn it if the pain
were slight, and the possible utility to humanity very great.

Four statements of Opinion were carefully formulated, and to these
a ﬁfth was ﬁnally added, which was sent, however, as hereafter noted,
to but very few others than members of the medical profession. But
even these could by no means express all the shades of differing
opinion which seem to exist in regard to this subject. Some few
persons indeed could ﬁnd nothing in either statement to endorse or
condemn, while others, reading with extreme and careful discrimina-
tion, indicated by erasures and changes in phraseology their variance
of opinion. But that the statements, as drawn, do fairly represent
existing opinions is evinced by the fact, that, without any erasures
or changes, each one received the signatures of men of national
reputation. .

The choice of persons whose views on this question should be
solicited was a matter of no little consideration. It was, of course,
impossible to ask all whose judgment would be valuable; and such
selection was necessary as at least should be fairly representative in
character and weight. It may be of interest to know the leading

‘rules which governed the ﬁnal choice of names.

1. In the ﬁrst place, the opinions of the Medical Profession were
desired. For their beneﬁt, real or supposed, the practice of vivisec-
tion is mostly carried. on. If, then, all experiments upon living
animals are of such great value that no restraint whatever need be
observed, it might be safely assumed that medical men after years
of practical experience in. the treatment of disease would be certain
to know it. But the number of men in the medical profession in
this country alone is over one hundred thousand, and to ask the
judgment of all these would be manifestly impracticable. Then,
too, the opinions of young men fresh from the medical school could
not compare in value with those of other physicians who for years
have been engaged in the combat with disease. It was necessary
somewhat to draw lines. The medical profession .in the States of
New York and. Massachusetts may be" assumed to be as intelligently
acquainted with the whole subject as physicians anywhere in the
United. States, and it seemed to us exceedingly probable that the
views of physicians in other sections of the country would not greatly
differ in their proportions from the varying judgments regarding
vivisection which should be elicited in these two great common-
wealths. Every physician in these two States who had been at least
ﬁfteen years in the practice of his profession was invited to give the
Association the beneﬁt of his mature experience on the question. A

few prominent medical men in other States received like invitations,
but these instances were rare. The physicians upon the Board of
Instructors in several leading medical colleges in New York, Boston,
Philadelphia, Syracuse, Chicago, and other cities were also asked for
expressions of opinion. The jury in this case seems to us to be fairly
representative Of the medical profession, and the results obtained
were so unexpected as to call for special remark. If we may judge
from the replies received, the majority Of physicians who have tested
value by experience are not in favor of “unrestricted vivisection.”

2. For the opinions of those engaged in Educational work, our cir-
culars were sent, ﬁrst, to the president of each college and university
in the United States; and, next, to the principal members of the
teaching faculty of the leading institutions of learning. ‘

3. In respect to Clergymen, it was very difﬁcult to determine from
whom among them opinions should be asked; and, as in the case of
physicians, it was deemed best to solicit views only among those of
the various denominations whose years of service or whose promi-
nent position in the Church lent to their words a greater weight.
To professors in various theological schools, to clergymen in our
larger cities, and especially to men. upon whom for years of service
or unusual activity in clerical work the degree of Doctor of Divinity
has been conferred, our circulars have been principally addressed.
Your committee regret the modest reticence which in so many in—
stances probably prevented that mention Of honorary degrees to
which signers were entitled, and of which note was requested. In
some cases, by careful research, these have been supplied; but there
are doubtless many to which such titles belong, and from which they
are absent in the lists which follow.

4. From Literary Men, Editors, and Authors, Opinions were sought,
when addresses could be obtained, wherever achievement and worthy
popularity lent weight to the expression of their views. Besides all
these classes, there were a few others in other walks of life for
whose judgment the world has regard, and whose Opinions have been
sought. From foreign countries also some expression of sentiment
was desired; but these names are reckoned separately in the lists
which. follow.

Your committee believe that Opinions thus Obtained are Of special
value. We have not attempted. a mere “counting Of heads.” We
believe that the views thus collected do represent, in their propor-
tions, the various shades of Opinion which prevail among the edu-
cated classes Of the country in regard to the question of unrestricted
vivisection.

It is to be regretted that in some instances the purpose of this
inquiry should have been so misunderstood, and that those who

 




 

 

  

6 REPORT OF THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION

might have aided us by some expression of opinion preferred rather
the expression of criticism or abuse. One of the most prominent
biologists of America suggested, with ghastly and peculiar humor,
“that the American Humane Association do science the good service
of suppressing anti-vivisectionists,— by persuasion, if possible, but
by vivisection, if the seat of disease is too deep for more humane
relief.” Another eminent scientiﬁc man belonging to Syracuse
University went so far as to write an anonymous letter to your com-
mittee, suggesting that, before touching the question of vivisection,
the American-Humane Association should bring law to interfere
with such cruelties as “.pOisoning roaches and bed-bugs, chasing
butterﬂies, breaking down spiders’ webs, stealing honey from
bees,” etc., —-—actions which he would apparently have regarded as

. even more reprehensible than the torments inﬂicted by Magendie,

Mantegazza, and their imitators, upon man’s nearest companion and
friend. Detection of the writer was not at all difﬁcult, but further
publicity than this would be too severe a punishment for what
perhaps Was a thoughtless act.

Numerous letters were received either'accompanying signatures to
one of the statements or in explanation of disagreement with their
phraseology. Your committee exceedingly regret that limitations of
space prevent anything but the briefest quotation from the majority
of these communications. Some of these valued letters may perhaps
hereafter be printed in other form. For all suggestions and advice
the committee tender thanks. Even the few ungracious and critical
epistles received are not without their value, if only as indications
of proclivities and tendencies of which note must be taken.

What are the results of our investigations ? May we assume that
in the more educated classes of the United States a majority of
persons approve of the dissection of living animals to any extent and
for any purpose a physiologist may desire ‘?

lessness really arise. What is the judgment of medical men whose

We regard this result of our inquiries as of unusual value. For
many years it has been taken for granted that on one side of this
question of free vivisection were the only true guardians of scientiﬁc
research, the united ranks of physicians and surgeons, urging the
value of all experiments the physiologist desires to make; while
on the other side were to be found only ignorance and sentimen—
tality united in Opposing what they did not comprehend and could
not value. We see that this is entirely an erroneous conception
of facts. It is only the minority of experienced physicians that
demand for physiological research unlimited opportunity indepen-
dent of utility, and many of these are physiologists rather than
general practitioners. The great majority of medical men ask,
indeed, that experimentation shall not be wholly abolished; but.they
ask also that [it shall not be abused. They condemn the cruel freedom
which exists on the continent of Europe, and, as a rule, the repetition
of painful experiments for the teaching of well-known facts.

We cannot refrain from quoting here the opinion of one of the
most distinguished physicians in this country, ——Dr. Theophilus
Parvin, LL.D., late president of the American Academy of Medicine,
and professor in Jefferson Medical College, ———as an illustration of
what we believe to be the position of the majority of the medical
profession in this country who have reached middle age: —-

“It is wise for physicians interested in vivisection to recognize
that there is on the part of prominent women and men in the laity
a strong sentiment of antagonism to experiment on animals; and
therefore they should avoid all such work not promising certain
beneﬁt to man, and anaesthetics ought always to be employed. I
sometimes fear that the anaesthesia is frequently nominal rather
than real, else why so many and ingenious contrivances for con-
ﬁning the animal during Operations,—contrivances that are not

made use of in surgical. Operations upon human beings, their immo-

bility being secured by profound anaesthesia.

“Should the law restrict the performance of viviSection? I think
it ought, chieﬂy as an expression of public sentiment, and for moral
effect. . . . That restriction ought to forbid all experiments made
without worthy objects, and in every case, so far as possible, the
animal during and subsequent to the operation must be preserved
from pain.

,“Vivisection is in more danger from ignorant, rash, and reckless
experimenters than from those directly hostile to it. I cannot think
that vivisections done for teaching purposes, simply showing what
has been proved time and again upon hundreds and thousands of
victims, are justiﬁable unless anaesthesia is employed, to not merely
mitigate, but to completely abolish snﬁ‘ering of the animals. Other-
wise the inﬂuence of such experiments is injurious both to the operator
and to the witnesses of the operation.”

Let us analyze yet more closely the medical opinions received
from Massachusetts and New York. The replies received from
physicians in these States may be tabulated as follows:—

We see no reason to doubt that, with slight variations only, these
proportions represent the sentiments prevailing in. the medical pro-
fession throughout the country. If we ask the judgment of other
inﬂuential classes in the community, we ﬁnd the same tendency,
even more pronounced. In the following tables we have indicated a
number of opinions from clergymen, educators, presidents of univer-
sities and colleges, and those engaged in college work, etc: —

ON VIVISECTION IN AMERICA. 9

To your committee, therefore, it seems certain that the majority of
those who represent enlightened public opinion in this country are
not favorable to unlimited vivisection. They do not indeed demand
abolition of all experimental research Whatever; nor are they agreed
as to the SCOpe of restrictions, the value of legal regulation, the deﬁ-
nition of “utility,” or the methods by which even desirable restraints
may be practically enforced. There is also somewhat of scepticism
as to the extent to which vivisection has been at all abused, and
many who would quickly condemn the evil are far from being con-
vinced that such evil exists. But one fact stands clearly out, that a

majority of the class to whom we have appealed agree that wherever

vivisection approaches cruelty and uselessness, [it should be prohibited
and condemned by law.

It is true, however, that this investigation has made evident the
existence of a minority contrary sentiment, of which due note must
be taken. There are physicians and surgeons whose self-sacriﬁcing
devotion to humanity is beyond the possibility of doubt, who have
signed for unlimited vivisection without criticism or restraint.
There are presidents of universities whose zeal for science has led
them to declare that with vivisection “morality has nothing to do.”
There are clergymen of high. repute who would condemn all cruelty
in the abstract, but whose faith “in the substance of things un-
seen” would make of the physiological laboratory a temple for
Humanity where all sacriﬁce is painless and its object the universal
good. ‘

There are large numbers of persons who suggest that all criticism
of scientiﬁc methods is premature, or out of place in. the presence of
such other forms of wide-spread cruelty as accompany butchery and
so—called sport. There are others who deprecate the inﬂiction of
pain or disuse of anaesthetics, unless it happens to be “necessary for
the success of the experiment,” ———a qualiﬁcation which at once nulliﬁes
the very restriction implied. In many colleges and institutions of
learning we note a prevalent disposition to trust a vivisector entirely,
“unless there seems reason for distrust,” ——a contingency which is
not likely to happen, where trust is absolute and faith serene. But
above everything else exists doubt or ignorance of what vivisection
really is. A method of scientiﬁc research is shrouded in mystery,
and is almost unknown and unknowable save to a few.

What action may be suggested to the American Humane Associa-
- tion as a result of your committee’s inquiry?

The following conclusions seem to them not only to be justiﬁed
by evidence, but in accord with the interests of both science and
humanity:—

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

  

10 REPORT OF THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION.

I. Vivisection is not merely a method of scientiﬁc teaching or
investigation, but a practice which is justly subject to ethical
restraints.

II. We believe this practice has been abused. We are compelled
to admit that President Parvin was right in declaring before the
American Academy of Medicine that there are some American vivi—
sectors “who seem, seeking useless knowledge, to be blind to writh-
ing agony and deaf to the cry of pain, and to have been guilty of
the most damnable cruelties.”

III. We believe in the potency of legislation to lessen these
abuses. Again we agree with President Parvin that “law should
restrict the performance of vivisection, ” that “vivisections done for
teaching purposes, simply showing what» has been proved time and
again upon hundreds and thousands of victims, are not justiﬁable un-_
less anaesthesia is employed, to not merely mitigate, but'to completely
abolish the suffering of the animals.” We are glad to ﬁnd ourselves
in perfect accord with a scientiﬁc authority who declares that “the
inﬂuence of such experiments without anaesthesia is injurious both
to the operator and to the witnesses of the operation.”

IV. But far transcending in importance the enactments of any
restrictive legislation is the wide dissemination of absolute, accurate
knowledge of vivisection as it is to-day Carried on in the seclusion of
American laboratories. It is alleged that the inﬂiction of pain is of
rare occurrence; that abuses are unknown, and that nothing whatever
is done which in any way needs to be concealed from the public eye.
But these statements are controverted. How then shall truth be
reached and be made evident ? It seems to us that knowledge, if
attainable, must rest here, as Science declares it must rest elsewhere,
not on the statements of interested parties, buton that ﬁrm basis
she herself demands,——the accurate observation of facts by impartial
witnesses. Yet, how is such evidence possible so long as the doors
of laboratories are locked and barred to the public, and even to
physicians and surgeons who are not personally known ? In the
interests of scientiﬁc truth we suggest therefore that an experiment

' be made. We recommend that the American Humane Association

during'the coming year ask of each physiological laboratory in this
country, whether it will accord permission to the President of the
local Humane Society or to his authorized representative to be
present during any experiments upon animals that may take place,
simply as a silent observer, and entirely without privilege 0f sug-
gestion, criticism, or unsolicited remark. If there be no occasion

for mystery or- seclusion, we believe this privilege will be accorded,
if only in the interests of truth and for the dissipation of error.

If refused, there can be but one inference and but one remaining
appeal.

Respectfully submitted.

(Signed) TITUS MUNSON COAN, M. D. .
ALBERT LEFFINGWELL, M. D.
MATTHEW Woons, M. D.»

In accordance with the above recommendation the American
Humane Association adopted the following resolution: ——

“Resolved, That the American Humane Association, having con-
sidered the report of its Special Committee 011 Vivisection, believes
that it should ask for yet more light regarding the aims and methods
of experimentation upon living animals. Laying aside for the present
all other evidence, the Association. seeks now for positive knowledge
by that method which Science idealizes and demands, —based, not
upon authority, but upon the accumulated experience of a large num-
ber of independent observers in all parts of the country.

“The Association therefore instructs its President and Secretary,
as soon as may be, to ask the authorities having in charge every
known physiological laboratory in the United States, whether or not
they will accord permission to the President of the local Society,
having for its object the prevention of cruelty, or to his authorized
representative for the time being, the right of admission to the lab-
oratory during any experiments of any kind upon living animals,
simply as a student and observer, and entirely without the right of
suggestion, criticism, or unsolicited remarks of any kind.”

 

 




 

 

 

 

  

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF VIVISECTION.

I. ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION 0F VIVISECTION.

ALL experimentation upon living animals we consider unnecessary,
unjustiﬁable, and morally wrong. Some of the highest medical
authorities have asserted that Vivisection does not beneﬁt mankind;
that owing largely to differences between the structure of men and
animals, the results of operations and the test of drugs upon the
latter are wholly misleading, and that the practice has accomplished
nothing of real value in the treatment of disease. The greatest
physiologist of our century, Sir Charles Bell, declared that such
“experiments have never been the means of discovery; ” and that
“the opening of living animals has done more to perpetuate error
than to enforce the just views taken. from anatomy and natural
science.” Mr. Lawson. Tait, one of the most eminent of living sur-
geons, claims that but for the fallacies of Vivisection, the art of heal-
ing would be ‘to-day “at least a century in advance of its present
position; ” and Dr. Bell Taylor, one of the leading oculist-surgeons
of Great Britain, afﬁrms that “no good ever came from the practice,
and no good ever will.” With these scientiﬁc authorities we are in
perfect accord.

But whether any useful knowledge can be thus acquired or not is
beside the question. Even if utility could be proved, man has no
moral right to attempt to beneﬁt himself at the cost of injury, pain,
or disease to the lower animals. The injury which the practice of
Vivisection causes-t0 the moral sense of the individual and to human-
ity far outweighs any possible beneﬁt that could be derived from it.
Dr. Henry J. Bigelow, Professor in the Medical School of Harvard
University, declared that “ Vivisection deadens the humanity of the
students.” Nothing which thus lowers morality can be a necessity
to progress.

We hold the inﬂiction of torture to be a moral offence ; and believe
experience has demonstrated that Vivisection cannot be sanctioned in
any form without opening a door to that offence. We assert that no
legal protection from the utmost extremity of torment can ever be
given to an animal when once it is laid on the Vivisection table in the
laboratory; and that no line can be drawn between experiments that
are painless and those involving the utmost torture. The claim that
Vivisection has been rendered generally painless by the use of anaes-
thetics is wholly misleading; for physiologists themselves admit that
there are no less than thirteen classes of experiments which cannot
be satisfactorily performed on anaesthetised animals.

To allow one kind of Vivisection because “painless” and to con-
demn another because ‘-‘ painful” is thus utterly impracticable. N o

distinctions could be drawn that the enthusiastic experimenter would
regard, and no legal restrictions are possible that would be cOnscien-
tiously observed. Painless or painful, useless or useful, however
severe or however slight, Vivisection is therefore a practice so linked
with cruelty, and so pernicious in tendency, that any reform is
impossible, and it should be absolutely prohibited by law for any
purpose.

Prof. JAMES E. GARRETSON, M. D., Senior Professor of Surgery,
Medico-Chirurgical College, Philadelphia : ——

been a teacher of anatomy and surgery for thirty years. It serves no pur-
pose that is not better served after other manners.”

for Mental Diseases, Physician to North London HOSpital for Con-
sumption, etc. :—

“In my opinion, vivisection has opened up no new views for the treat-
ment and cure of diseases. It is most unjustifiable and cruel, and in no way
advances medical science. I do not believe in many of the so—called experi-
ments made by these ‘faddists,’ especially those relating to brain operations
on monkeys and the consequent theory of cerebral localization. I have
probably more experience than many of these experimenters who have given
their opinions to the world as based on what they have done; and I beg leave
to express my utter disbelief in the usefulness of such experiments, and to
discredit their being followed by any good results to mankind or to science
in general.”

causes which lead to it; and it is subversive of the high and moral order of

advantages temporarily gained. One crime or fault does not excuse or

ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION OF VIVISECTION. \15

Rt. Rev. HUGH MILLER THOMPSON, D. D., Bishop of Mississippi.
Rt. Rev. J. H. D. VVINGEIELD, D. D., Bishop of N. California.

eral Theological Seminary, New York.
Rev. Dr. LYMAN WHITNEY ALLEN, Newark, N. J. : ——

“If vivisection could be absolutely without pain, I should be willing to
advocate it under certain restrictions. But who shall be the judge? As it
is at present conducted, it is immoral and wicked. The only safe and Chris-
tian standpoint is absolute prohibition. Science has its limits, as have other
branches of investigation. Valuable and important as is biological study,
life and animal individuality and consciousness have their God-given rights.”

Rev. Dr. G. H. DE BEVOISE, Keene, N. H. : ——

“Although never having occasion to protest against an act Of this kind
because Of knowledge Of its occurrence, I am most decidedly in favor of the
absolute prohibition of vivisection, if this may be accomplished. The end in
view by no means justiﬁes the means, and very Often the enthusiasm of
scientiﬁc investigation overrides all humane considerations, and is willing
that there may -be any amount of suffering if only ambition may accomplish
its end. Vivisection is more than cruel. It is Wicked cruelty, concentrated.”

Rev. Dr. AMORY H. BRADFORD, Associate Editor of “The Out-
look,” New York: ——

“I incline to a middle ground between I. and II., but prefer to sign
the ﬁrst.”

Rev. Wm. A. McCorker, Detroit, Mich. :—

“Unless vivisection is absolutely 7LeCessa7'y
to protect human life and to guard
against human suffering, I am perfectly
clear that it should not be practised.
Whether there is ever such necessity I
hardly feel competent to decide. If there
ever is such occasion for its practice, it
should be rendered painless. I think
my place is with those absolutely pro-
hibiting it.”

“We believe that animals have rights and
should be protected from cruelty: the
inhumanity and barbarism of vivisec-
tion seem certain, its good effects are
doubtful; the ﬁrst position therefore
seems to us the correct 011e,.that. the
practice should be abolished, under
pains and penalties.”

Rev. Albert E. Pierce, Danbury, Conn. :—

“ I cannot indorse all in the statement made
above. My opinion is that no such
beneﬁt. results from vivisection as war—
rants the practice of it; therefore my
judgment as well as my sympathies are
strongly against it. [fit can be shot/m
that great good has resulted to human
life either in the treatment of or preven—
tion of disease, which good could not
have come through other methods of
investigation, then I should favor the
‘second’ statement, but under the
most stringent regulations. But it will
take a great deal more evidence than I
have yet seen to produce such a convic—

I am strongly opposed to vivisection in

II. VIVISECTION ALLOWABLE IF WITHOUT PAIN.

VVHETHER that experimentation upon living animals known as
Vivisection is justiﬁable or not, depends, in our judgment, exclusively
on the question of pain. Utility alone cannot give Science her
authority; for then might she ask, as she sometimes has already
done, for the living bodies of the criminal, the idiot, or the savage,
wherein to search for the mysteries of life. We believe that Man’s
dominion over the animated world beneath him is not absolute; that
the power to kill. does not cover the right to torture; that our power
is responsible; that our Humanity invests us with certain moral
obligations toward the lower forms of life; and thatunder these
Man is not free to treat even the scorpion or the tiger as they might
treat him. But the use of chloroform and ether have made it pos-
sible to perform certain experiments and demonstrations upon liv-
ing animals without the slightest pain, and these only we regard as
justiﬁable for demonstration or research.

The dangers of this practice, however, are so many, the tempta-
tions to excess are so strong, the abuses to which. it has led are so
notorious and deplorable, that the decision of this question of pain
should not be left to the judgment of each experimenter; but the
Whole practice, like the study of human anatomy with dissection,
should be regulated by deﬁnite laws, conﬁned to certain objects,
permitted only to competent and trustworthy persons, and restricted
to licensed places which shall be open at all times to inspection by
the Presidents of Humane Societies for Protection of Animals or
their authorized representatives.

“ I give the above my emphatic approval. But if vivisection thus re—
stricted and guarded is not attainable, I should afﬁx my signature to N o. I.”

CLINTON WAGNER, M. D., Senior Surgeon of the Metropolitan
Throat Hospital, New York City: —

“Vivisection may be allowable if without pain and performed by the
Professor or his licensed assistants, and only in the laboratories of incorpo-
rated medical schools.”

W. C. BOUTON, A. B., M. D., Clinical Instructor in Neurology at
the Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Ill. : —.

“I do not believe that vivisection should be wholly dispensed with, for I
believe that we can still gain some valuable knowledge from it. But I believe,
as stated, that it should be Without pain, regulated by deﬁnite laws, conﬁned

- “I do not believe in these cases any tyro should be allowed to vivisect ;
nor do I believe in vivisect-ion just to verify old experiments. Unless

something of great value is to be gained in a scientiﬁc way, it should be for-
bidden even under the influence of an anaesthetic.”

Prof. W. T. VVENZELL, M. D., Ph. D., Professor of Chemistry, etc.,
University of California, San Francisco, Cal.
Rev. FREDERIC R. MARVIN, M. D., Troy, N. Y. : —-

“I believe vivisection should be allowable in cases Where pain may be
avoided, and then only as conducted by experts for some deﬁnite end of
sufﬁcient consequence. It should never be allowed for mere purposes of
demonstration, or as a method of instruction in the class—room or in the medi-

“ Without supervision, indifferent experimenters might say that they had

JOHN \VESLEY DAILY, A. 13., M. D.,Boston, Mass:—

“Man, by reason of superior intelligence, does not own the earth. He
is simply one of the creatures growing out of the conditions that give and

“The experiments should be such as to inﬂict no pain during the Opera-

Rev. WILLIAM P. SHROM, D. D., Pittsburg, Pa. :-—-—

“ I should much prefer to Sign NO. I., but am nOt quite sure but it
would hinder to some extent the furthering of scientiﬁc investigation. My
whole heart is on that side of the question, and my head more than half there
too; yet for the present I give the investigalor the beneﬁt of my doubt.”

Rev. HERMAN O. RIGGS, D. D., Rochester, N. Y.:—

“NO. II. comes nearest of your four forms to being my answer. But I
favor this limited permission only with the condition that experimentation
shall be conducted by none but expert investigators, and by them only for
new or unsettled experiments. A result once deﬁnitely and clearly reached
by authoritative investigation, vivisection with reference to that should im-
mediately cease to be permissible.”

Rev. ROBERT AIKMAN, D. D., Madison, N. J. : —

“It seems to me that the above statement meets the demands of an en-
lightened and humane public opinion. The pain of instantaneously inﬂicted
death is not greater than the ordinary pains of natural death. and death
under the inﬂuence of chloroform is without pain. There seem to have been
discoveries made of the causation of disease and of remedial agencies in the,
relief and cure of diseases which make painless vivisection allowable; and
especially if the places where it is performed are open to inspection as
above?’

“Vivisectionjustiﬁed by utility and pain-

the ordinary lecturer or practitioner.”

Rev. Henry E. Niles, D. D., York, Pa.

“Vivisection allowable if without pain, but

“I do not accept this statement unquali-
ﬁedly. Pain in animals may be jus-
tiﬁable if certain to give knowledge
that will relieve human pain. I would,
therefore, partially approve III. But the
peril is that science will disregard pain
in its zeal of discovery. I favor very
rigid laws of restriction, and every effort

to create a humane public sentiment.”

“My convictions almost take in the ﬁrst (1.)
form. Man has dominion over brute
creation, and sometimes beneﬁts may
come through a special experiment (of
a painless character). Humane experts
must decide thatpainless case.”

“Exceptions tO this rule should be limited
by definite law to experiments essential
to the interests of humanity, and which
are impossible with the use of chloro-

“ 'Vivisection allowable if without pain, and

Rev. James Wm. Ashton, D. D., Olean, N.Y. 2

“ The above expresses most nearly my view,

I but should modify it in exceptional
cases by thefollowing one; namely,
Vivisectz'on restricted by utility, for the

“ I can easily see that vivisection is valuable
to science; at the same time, God has
given nerves to animals as he has to us.
They suffer pain as we do, and I con-
ceive we have no right to inﬂict upon
them needless pain. Since we can use
anaesthetics with animals as well as with

therefore most heartily vote for your

III. VIVISECTION RESTRICTED BY UTILITY.

VIVISECTION is a practice of such variety and complexity, that,
like warfare between. nations, one can neither condemn it nor approve
it unless some careful distinctions be ﬁrst laid down. We hold that
only a great and deﬁnite advantage to the interests of humanity can
justify its use, and that in each case Science must prove that advan-

tage and that necessity; its hands

should not be left free to inﬂict

torture without restriction or restraint. Even the zeal of a Magendie

justified by utility as to be legitimate, expedient, and right. Beyond

these boundaries it is cruel, monstrous, and wrong.

Experimentation upon living animals we consider justiﬁable when
employed to determine the action of new remedies; for tests of sus-
pected poisons; for the study of new methods of surgical procedure,
or in the search for the causation of disease, -— in short, for any
object where the probable beneﬁ to mankind is very great, and the
suffering inﬂicted not greater than that of instantaneous death, nor
more than the pain and distress of the human ailments to alleviate
which the experiment is made. On the other hand, we regard as
cruel and wrong the inﬂiction of torment upon animals in the search
for physiological facts which have no conceivable relation to the
treatment of human diseases; or experiments that seem to be made
only for the purpose of gratifying a heartless curiosity, —— such, for
example, as those described in the work of Professor Mantegazza,
entitled “The Effect of Pain upon Respiration.”

We consider as wholly unjustifiable the common practice in the
United States of subjecting animals to torture in the laboratory or
classroom, merely for the purpose of demonstrating well-known and
accepted facts. We hold that the inﬂiction of torment upon, a living
animal under such circumstances is not justiﬁed by necessity, nor
is it a ﬁtting exhibition for the contemplation of youth. And since
in England, Scotland, and Ireland such experiments as these are
regarded as degrading in tendency, and are therefore forbidden by
law, we think no harm will come to Science if they shall also be
forbidden in every American State. .

We believe, therefore, that the common interests of Humanity
and Science demand that Vivisection, like the study of human
anatomy in the dissecting-room, should be brought under the direct
supervision and control of the State. The practice, whether-in
public or in private, should be restricted by law to certain deﬁnite
objects, and surrounded by every possible safeguard against license
or abuse.

[Several shades of opinion are represented by the signatures to this state—
ment. As a rule, disagreement is indicated by various erasures of words,
sentences, or paragraphs, made in order to shape the phrascology of the state—
ment into accord with individual views. The signers of this statement may be
classiﬁed as follows :—

1. Those who have signed the statement without changing it in any way.
Many of these have even underscored certain sentences, particularly in the. last
paragraph.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36 VIVISECTION RESTRICTED BY UTILITY.

2. Those who agree in the condemnation of torture as a method of teaching
well-known physiological facts, and in general approval of State supervision
and control of Vivisection; but who, for various reasons, prefer to soften and

change the phraseology of the statement in less important particulars. Their

eliminations sometimes refer to single words or short phrases, such as “mone
strous,” “ wholly unjustifiable,” “very great,” “ the common practice,” “ must
prove necessity,” “a great advantage,” etc.; or they may affect entire sen—
tences, such as the attempt to deﬁne the limits of permissible pain-inﬂiction,
the allusion to Magendie and Mantagazza, and particularly the reference to the
example of Great Britain. (This last clause is to many especially obnoxious.)

3. Those who denounce or condemn the use of torture as a method of teach-
ing well-known facts, but who cannot approve of any appeal to legislation for
its prohibition. As a rule, those who take this position would place no impedi—
ments in the way of any original research in any direction. Disapproval of
minor points in the phraseology of the statement is quite common.

4. Those who believe that Vivisection should be under more or less super-
vision by the State, but who apparently would not cOndemn even painful
experiments for teaching purposes, if in the judgment of the teacher pain can
be thus made “useful.” I

"5. Those whose erasures, changes, and eliminations affect absolutely and
vitally every important part of the entire statement. They do not approve of
supervision nor restraint, nor do they condemn any form of experimentation for
any object. It is not easy to perceive wherein their views differ from those who
favor “VIVISECTION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS” of any kind. It would, of
course, be a mistake to co'unt these names With those of the majority who favor
the leading principles of the statement and restricted vivisection.]

HERBERT SPENCER, Author, London.
Sir EDWIN ARNOLD, Author, and Editor of the “ London Tele-
graph,” London : ——

“ It is with this that I agree, detesting and dreading unlicensed vivisection.
But I love and honour Science too much to deny her any right, exercised
with true scientiﬁc spirit ; that is, with reverence, mercy, and love to all
living things. I would hardly allow even an angel to vivisect without
anaesthetics.” -

The fourth statement, Sir Edwin Arnold characterizes as “the language
of scientiﬁc devils.”

ROBERT BRAITHWAITE, M. D, F. L. 8., London : —-

“ . . . After facts have been sufficiently established, it is not necessary
to repeat experiments for individual satisfaction, still less for demonstration
to students; the facts should be accepted from the teacher equally with other
facts which cannot be demonstrated.”

“Vivisection is practised more than is necessary; it ought undoubtedly
to be restrained. Doubtless it has its uses in teaching, but its value in inves-
tigation has been overrated.”

Prof. WILLIAM JAMES, M. D., Author ; Professor of Psychology,
Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. : —

“ If public opinion could constitute the check, I should prefer that; but
that would necessarily be ineffectual. I think there will be great difﬁculty
in deﬁning by law what is legitimate, or in having whatever law were ‘made,
diseriminatingly administered. In principle, however, I have not a moment’s
hesitation in standing up for the vivisector being outwardly responsible for
his acts.”

it. Rev. HENRY A. NEELY, Bishop of Maine : —-

“ The above statement most nearly expresses my views. If the opinions
of Sir Charles Bell, Dr. Lawson Tait, and Dr. Bell-Taylor (quoted in the ﬁrst
statement) were generally endorsed by pathologists of the highest class, it
would follow, me judice, that vivisection can in no case be justified.”

Rt. Rev. JOSEPH BLOUNT CHESHIRE, J r., Bishop of South Carolina :

“ IVhile as a matter of sentiment I am strongly inclined to say that Vivi
section should be absolutely prohibited, yetI am not able to justify that
position fully to my mind and conscience. The statement of ‘vivisection
restricted by utility,’ seems to me to be in accordance with relations which
God has established and declared between man and the lower orders of
living creatures. Viviseetion Should be allowed only in case of necessity or
of great utility, and then under strict regulations.”

necessary and absurd use of animals to amuse students and idlers, I send you
my protest, with the hope that your Object is to lessen the evil.”

DANIEL COOK, M. D., New York City : ——

“In my experience, certain vivisections are performed mostly for the
most unworthy object of making the lectures sensational above those at other
colleges, — exactly as our theatres and newspapers vie with one another in
furnishing blood-curdling plays, or sensational news.”

fourth statement. The whole mind is absorbed in the subject; and clear
unbiassed reasoning is then out Of the question. I felt thus myself, at one
time, when full Of my subject, as well as full of youthful ardor. After mature
deliberation, I freely and unconditionally subscribe to this statement.”

perimenter ﬁle an application, giving the nature and intention of the Oper-
ation, and subsequently report the number, size, and quality of animals
employed, with the results obtained. Such, a course would check needless
and vicious operations.” _

(Dr. Hope graduated twenty years ago from a medical college notorious
for its extreme vivisections.)

ARCHIBALD T. BANNING, M. D., Pres. City Medical Association,
Mt. Vernon, N. Y. :—

“Iwell remember when a student the feelings of horror that arose on
seeing certain experiments. . . . The ﬁrst experiment was altogether an out-
rage; the second, though of some utility, had already been sufﬁciently
demonstrated, and a mere statement from the professor would have accom-
plished as much instruction as ocular evidence. The impression thus made
on the unformed minds of students is bad, and might have a tendency to
develop some morbid psychopathic action such as ‘ Sadism.’ I have such
cases in View.”

JOHN L. SOHOOLORAFT, M. D., Schenectady, N. Y. :—

“The continual practice of vivisection by assistant lecturers and others
to show what has been thoroughly proven by men of reputation, should be
absolutely prohibited.”

WILLIAM J. BURR, M. D., late Acting Staff-Surgeon, U. S.A.,
Newark Valley, N. Y. :—

should be made.”

advanced in the third statement and
the limitations therein suggested also
strongly appeal to me. Regarding
vivisection as a method of study in
some public and private schools, I hold
the strongest opinions; namely, that
such use should be utterly, entirely,

extremest penalties.”

Rev. Dr. Mern Adams, Rochester, N. Y.
Rev. Nathaniel Seaver, Jr., Leicester, Mass.:

scientiﬁc schools, and prohibit it else-
where altogether, especially in presence
of minors.”

Rev. A S. Garver, D. D., Worcester, Mass.
Kev. T. M. Hodgdon, West Hartford, Conn:
“ Vivisection should be without pain so far
as possible.”

Rev. Dr. Wm. A. Keese, Lawrence,-Mass.:
“I am by no means sure but that the ﬁrst
statement. is correct; yet not. having
special knowledge on the subject, I
incline to the more conservative opin-
ions of this statement.”

Rev. Dr. C. E. S. Rasay, Carthage, N. Y.:

" I should favor absolute prohibition of
vivisection did I not think that there
are times when its practice results in
. good so great as to justify the sacriﬁce
of the animal. Undoubtedly these cases
are rare, and restrictions should be made
even stronger than indicated above.”

Rev. Dr. T. T. Mung-er, New Haven, Conn.:

“Vivisection should be under strict and
careful supervisiOn, but with a leaning
to No. II. I would conﬁne it to experts
for the sake of discovery, and shut it
out as means of demonstrating estab-
lished facts.”

Rev. \Vm. C. Stiles, D. D.,Jackson, Mich.:

“ Vivisection should always be without pain
when anaesthetics do not prevent the
experiment.” A

Rev. Joseph J. Woolley, Pawtucket, R. I.

Rev. John G. Davenport, S. T. D., VVater-
bury, Conn.

Francis Ellingwood Abbott, Ph.D., Cam-
bridge, Mass.:-—-

“The above statement comes the nearest
to expressing my views on the subject,
but. I object strongly to the word ‘ util-
ity.’ Vivisection’ is a human action, a
part of conduct, and all conduct must
be governed by ethical principle, not
mere calculation of consequences. Vivi-
section, if really conducive to knowl-
edge (of which I am no judge), may be
prompted by motives of the purest
moral character, by the purpose of in-
ﬂicting some pain to prevent greater
pain, as in surgical or dental operations.
Only as a means to mercy and ultimate
diminution of suffering ought vivisec-
tion to be tolerated.”

VIVISECTION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. 57

IV (A). VIVISECTION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS.

VIVISECTION, or experimentation upon living creatures, must be
looked at simply as a method of studying the phenomena of Life.
\Vith it morality has nothing to do. It should be subject neither
to criticism, supervision, nor restrictions of any kind. It may be
used to any extent desired by any experimenter (no matter what .
degree of extreme or prolonged pain it may involve) for demon-
stration before students of the statements contained in their text-
books, as an aid to memory; for conﬁrmation of theories; for original
research; or for any conceivable purpose of investigation into vital
phenomena. We consider that sentiment has no place in the phy—
siological laboratory; that animals have there no “rights” which
Man is called upon to notice or respect; that Science cannot be
“ cruel” when her sole purpose is to investigate or demonstrate; that
it is as great an impertinence for Religion or Morality to assume to
sit in judgment upon. a scientiﬁc method, or to dictate to physiolo—
gists limitations beyond which extreme pain “ought not to be
inﬂicted,” as for Theology to tell the astronomer where in the skies
he should not direct his telescope, or the geologist what rocks he H”.
must not break.
And ﬁnally, while we claim many discoveries of value in the treat-
ment of human ailments to have been due to experiments upon
animals, yet even these we regard as of secondary importance to the
freedom of unlimited research, and the independenoevof Science from
all restrictions or restraints, —— agreeing largely with the statement of
Dr. Hermann, Professor of Physiology at Zurich, that “no true
investigator in his researches thinks of their practical utilization,
that the advancement of Knowledge, and not practical utility to
Medicine, is the true and straightforward object of all Vivisection.”

President J. G. SCHURMAN, Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. . ,
President DAVID S. JORDAN, M. 1)., Ph.D., LL.D., Stanford Uni— l
versity, California: —— l .
“ I believe that any attempt to restrict vivisection in the hands of compe- i
tent men, properly ﬁtted to act as investigators, would be thoroughly i
mischievous in its results. Nor do I believe that any considerable amount of
wanton pain has ever been inﬂicted by men whose original work as scientiﬁc “‘
investigators entitles them to the name. On the other hand, I greatly depre— y;
cate the mischief done by persons who are not investigators, but who imitate ﬁt
the actions of these for highly different purposes. The whole matter is one
for public opinion to regulate rather than the State. I do not ﬁnd my views at
expressed fully in any one of the four statements in the circular; but if I
should sign any one Of the four it would be this.”

Prof. JOSEPH LE CONTE, Professor of Geology and Natural History,
University of California, Berkeley: —— .

“I have carefully examined your propositions in regard to vivisection,
and cannot fully endorse any of them; but in the present condition of things
in this country I believe I would rather sign this than any of the others.
The question in my mind is between the third and fourth. My objection to
.the fourth is, that the mode of statement is too extreme. . . . I believe
licenses should be given (but somewhat freely) to competent and responsible
persons, and then no restrictions on mode of experimentation. I believe
also it should be used for investigation, not for class-room demonstration.

“ My objection to the third statement is the use of the word ‘utility.’ I
ﬁrmly believe that vivisection should be used —and will always be mostly used ~—
for purely scientiﬁc purposes, without any reference to immediate and visible
utility. Science will not advance unless truth is sought mainly for its own
sake.”

cannot be under anybody’s but the professor’s control.”)

VIVIsEoTION 'WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. 61

IV (B). VIVISECTION WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS.

[As the uncompromising phraseology of the ﬁrst statement seemed objectionable
to many, a new statement was formulated toward the close of the inquiry, and sent,
with preceding forms, principally to members of the medical profession]

VIVISECTION, or experimentation upon living animals, must be
looked at simply as a method of studying the phenomena of Life;
and as such it should be. subject neither to criticism, supervision,
nor restraints of any kind. '

It may be used by any scientiﬁc experimenter to any extent he
may desire, for demonstration before students of the statements con-
tained in their text-books, as an aid to memory, or for any conceiv-
able purpose of investigation into vital phenomena. And, while
many discoveries of value in the treatment of human ailments have
undoubtedly been due to experiments on animals, yet even these
we regard as of secondary importance to the absolute freedom of
research, and the independence of Science from all restrictions and.
restraints. Pure Science, which exists for its own sake, stands on
a far higher plane than Science which exists merely for utility to

mankind. We firmly believe that Vivisection should be used, and

will always be mostly used, to add to pure scientiﬁc knowledge as sac/2 ,
without reference to (my usefulness foreseen. Truth should be sought
for its own sake. Dr. Hermann, Professor of Physiology at Zurich,
has well said that “no true investigator in his researches thinks of
their practical utilization; that the advancement of Knowledge, and
not practical utility to Medicine, is the true and straightforward
object of all Vivisection.”

We would not avoid the question of Pain. It is often the neces-
sity of Vivisection. But Nature will not yield, all her secrets with—
out a wrench. For instance, if only by causing acute suffering a
teacher can illustrate the functions of the nervous system, should
he, merely for that reason, stay his hand ? Ought we to insist that

i an enthusiastic experimenter should forego any phase of research

whatever, simply because of the torture that research may perhaps
require ? Such questions afford but one reply. Science does not
place reverence for Pity higher than its reverence for any new fact
whatever.

In our judgment this question oflPain should be left absolutely to
the decision of the experimenter himself. He alone can determine
what degree of pain he needs to inﬂict for the success of his
experiment. No laws should. constrain him, no critics judge him.

. Dr. T. LAUDER BRUNTON, M. D., LL.D., F. R. 8., England: -—

“I feel very strongly that, while restriction by law is unadvisable and
likely to prove harmful, every operator must be, and ought to be, inﬂuenced
by public opinion and by his own conscience. I hold that vivisection opera-
tions belong to the same category as the use of the whip by coachmen ; and
that while any instances of abuse, either of experiments or of the whip by the
coachman or car-driver, ought to be taken cognizance of, and if necessary
punished, it is as objectionable to limit an experimenter in what he is going
to do as it would be to pass a law that no driver of a horse or other animal
was to carry a whip or other instrument which could be used for the inﬂiction
of pain upon the animal he is driving.”

(The advocates of restriction of vivisection'would probably agree with
Dr. Brunton that vivisection operations belong to the same category as the
use of the whip by coachmen. They would add, however, that. just as the
law recognizes what is cruelty on the part of the driver, and what may be
permissible to him, it should do the same in the case of the physiologist.)

Sir JOHN ERIC ERICHSEN, F. R. 8., F. R. C. 8., etc., Surgeon : ~—

“ Experiments on living animals are absolutely necessary for the advance—
ment of medical surgery and biological science. Such experiments should
not be allowed without proper restrictions as a safeguard against their abuse
by incompetent persons, or their being performed for futile purposes. Such
experiments should only be performed for purposes of utility, -— that is, the
advancement cf scientific knowledge, —— and not for the purpose of acquiring
manual dexterity; nor should they be allowed as class demonstrations or for
needless repetition. All experiments on living animals, if painful, should be
performed under an anaesthetic. ‘

“Experiments on ,. living animals are most carefully restricted in this
country. . . . I acted as government inspector of living animals for several
years, and I can safely assert that the provisions of the act were vigorously
enforced, and never, to my knowledge, contravened."

Prof. J. 8ULLY, London, England :—

“I believe both in the desirability of a certain control of vivisection ex—
periments by the feeling of a community, or rather in a free expression of
this feeling, and of urging it on legislators and others. At the same time, I
think if an ignorant public were to determine when and where such experi—
ments are to be carried out, some of the most valuable and useful parts of
scientiﬁc work would be arrested. It is eminently a case for adjustment
between a worthy popular sentiment and the claims of science. How these
are both to be satisﬁed I am not clear, though ﬁrmly believing in the
desirability.” -

From President FRANKLIN CARTER, LL.D.,Williams College, Mass. :

“The second statement comes nearest to my opinion; but I have no

belief in the desirableness of the State undertaking the delicate business of

‘ controlling or directing operations in laboratories. I do not sign the second
statement, but send you this general reply.”

 

From Prof. GEORGE A. COE,Ph.D.,P10fessor of Philosophy, Nmth-
weste1n University: ——-'

(Professor Coe objects to signing any of the statements, and adds :) “ The
outcome of this consideration is not to .let things take their course without
reference to humanitarian considerations, 011 rather that humanitarian ethics
should be persistently emphasized before all persons concerned, —students,
instructors, faculties.”

From JAMES R. CHADW1OK, M. D., Boston, Mass. : —

1“ Vivisection is sometimes abused by the inﬂiction of suffering upon the
brute creation without corresponding. beneﬁt to humanity. These abuses I
would like to see stopped. None of your plans seem to me to attain that
object without putting objectionable restrictions upon this practice.”

(Dr. Chadwick denies that it is a “common practice” in the United
States to subject animals to to1ture merely for the purpose of demonstrating
well known 011 accepted facts. The Committee beg to 111efe1 him to the
eailier editions of Flint’s Physiology, and to experiments upon the nervous
system there detailed, as having been made “for class demonstrations”)

 

From VINCENT Y. BOWDITOH, M. D., Harvard Medical School,
Boston, Mass :—

“After weighing the matter carefully, I can, I think, conscientiously sign
the second statement, ‘Vivisection 111est1icted by Utility.’ I believe ﬁrmly
that 1n the right hands vivisection has been and will be of great use to 1111-»
manity. At the same time, I think that much (I cannot say from experience
110w much) has been done that is not really necessary, and this I would have
stopped.”

From Rev. F. J. CLARE, Phillipsburg, Pa. : ~—

“It is questionable whether any prohibitory humane enactments can be
fully enforced 011 will be fully obey.ed Neve1theless, 1ight legislation is
helpful and salutary, and should be encou1 aged. ”

T. M. BALLIET, M. D., Philadelphia, Penn. : -—

“I have subscribed to vivisection restricted by utility, because I cannot
see the advantage 1n vivisection as class demonstration; but ﬁshing and gun-
ning are recreations inﬁnitely more cruel, and the pain inflicted3 on lower
animals many hundred times larger, than the most unbounded vivisection by
scientists.’

that vivisection should be allowed where there is hope of discovery of some
truth, or demonstration of some hypothesis of value to humanity, provided it
is conducted by men who are wise and well trained.”

From EPHRAIM CUTTER, M. D., LL.D., New York : —-

“ I am in favor of experiments made on criminals sentenced to death
justly, for the good of society; that is, in penal physiology. There is a cry-
ing need of the following experiments: (1) Feeding, to prove that tubercu-
losis is mainly caused by feeding, —and cured as caused, by feeding. (2)
That fatty degeneration is caused and cured by feeding. (3) That throm-
bosis is caused and cured by feeding. (4) That cancer is caused and cured
by feeding. (5) That all gravelly diseases come from, and can be made eur-
able by, feeding. (6) That the noxious properties of common foods be tested
on human criminals. (7) That consumption of the bowels be thus proved to
come from food. (8) Finally, that worthless and criminal lives thus be made
valuable for the good of society. .

“ I am utterly opposed to re-proving by vivisection facts already established.
Many lives are now saved in gun—shot wounds of the abdomen because of vivi-
sections on dogs, which otherwise would have been lost; but crime should
furnish the materials in most vivisections in the larger sense of the term.”

From NATHAN E. BRILL, A. M., M. D., Visiting Physician of Mt.

Sinai Hospital, New York : —_—

“I can only subscribe to statement III. in part, and to statement IV. (R) in
part. I do not believe in the restriction .to utility, nor in allowing unrestricted
vivisection. We do not produce disease in man for the purpose of producing
symptoms and pathological processes of that disease. Who would venture,
for example, to inoculate a human being with small-pox for the purpose of
showing its symptoms? Students are ready enough to take the word of the
teacher and their books as to the facts of that disease. Nothing of importance
is gained by subjecting animals to torture to demonstrate established facts.

Such experiments are wanton. The truths of physiological laws should be

taught, therefore, in the same way as are the facts of disease.

“ Excepting these limitations, I am of the Opinion that further restriction
of vivisection would be a hindrance to scientiﬁc progress. . . . Vivisection
should be taken away from those who use it simply to show generally accepted
facts in connection with vital phenomena, because such experiments are useless.
It seems to me to be an unj ustiﬁable use of vivisection to apply it, as some phy-
siologists do, simply to demonstrate facts which are universally accepted.”

Sir DYCE DUCKWORTH, M. D., LL.D., Honorary Physician to

H. R. H. the Prince of Wales : —-—

“A measure of State regulation is in my Opinion desirable; but senti—
mentalists who have no means of forming sound opinions on the problems
involved should not inﬂuence or bias the‘lcgislators. Vivisection should be
forbidden to any but skilled teachers.”

GEORGE FLEMING, 0.13., LL\.D., Ex-President of the Royal College

of Veterinary Surgeons, North Devon, England : ——

‘i I approve of this statement, ‘vivisection restricted by utility.’ ”

From SAMUEL W. ABBOTT, M. D., M. A., Secretary State Board
of Health, Boston, Mass. : —-

“The deﬁnition of viviscction is a pretty difﬁcult matter . . . I am in
favor of its continuance, with such restrictions as shall make it impossible to
conduct such operations in a cruel or painful manner.”

From PAUL CABUs, Editor of “ The Monist ” ' and “' The Open
Court” : -—

“None of the four statements represents the opinion which I hold. I
would formulate my position as favoring vivisection, with moral and without
legal restrictions. IWTliile I am convinced that viviscction cannot be abolished,
I insist upon its being restricted by the moral sentiment of the viviscctor and
his audience. -

“ The fundamental law of morality is not the avoidance of pain, but the
intellectual and emotional growth and expansion of our souls. . . . “Hier-
ever you can detect professors and students who with blunted moralsenses
necessarily and cruelly inﬂict pain, you should at least call attention to the
barbaric methods which they employ, even though they be scientists of high
repute. To pass new laws will do no good; but to ventilate the question
by public discussion, and help those viviseetionists who do not possess moral
restraint to acquire it, will do an immense deal of good.”

From MARY PUTNAM JACOBI, M. D., Visiting Physician at the
New York Inﬁrmary, Graduate from L’Ecole de Medicine, Paris,
France, 1871: ~—

“The fourth statement entirely represents my views on this important
question, yet leaves something to be added. It is in my opinion ridiculous
for outsiders, necessarily imperfectly acquainted with methods of physio-
logical research, to be allowed to prescribe what may or may not be done
to demonstrate a proposition or to impart to students a living conception of
the phenomena of life. But I think it quite fair that the experimenter
should ”like the butcher, and more than is at present the case with the
hunter—be to a certain extent supervised and expected to reduce to a
minimum the suffering inﬂicted, and to inﬂict none but what is absolutely
necessary to attain his chosen end.”

From MARY A. MIXER, M. D., formerly Professor of Physiology in
Northwestern University, Woman’s Medical College: ——

“ We consider any attempt to limit viviscction by the amount of pain
produced to be entirely impracticable, since we have no means of knowing
110W much pain an animal suffers compared to a human being.”

From Prof. ABBY LEACH, Vassar College, N. Y. : ——

“ Certainly, students in the laboratory ought to be held in check by their
instructors, and it is unwarrantably cruel not to avoid pain where it is pos-
sible. If, however, the search for truth demands pain, then have the pain.”

From Rev. “7. F. MUTCH, Ph.D., New Haven, Conn. : ~—

“With reference to the vivisection question, I am not disposed to sign
any of the statements proposed. Doubtless, there are abuses in colleges as

there are in barns; but it is clearly impossible to reach them with law, and
it is one of the things which must be entrusted to humanity as it is.”

Prof. BURT Gr. VVILDER, M. D., Professor of Physiology, etc., Cor»

nell University, Ithaca, N.’ Y. : —-

“ I cannot sign either of the declarations of your circular. My views and
practice are indicated in the enclosed lecture—sheet.”

(Extract) “From the use of a single word, ‘vivisection,’ for two widely
different things, —— painful and painless experimentation,—~have resulted
much confusion, injustice, and distress of mind. . . . Two kinds of vivisec—
tion should be verbally distinguished as sentisection and callisection. . .

\
‘Vithout prejudice to the claim of some that sentisection is demanded for the
advancement of knowledge by experts, the writer holds that it is not warranted

for the dissemination of knowledge.”

MONCURE D. CONWAY, M. A., L. H. D., Author, England: ——

“(1) I do not think that the question turns exclusively on pain; even with-
out pain, destruction of some animals should not be allowed without very great
advantage, —:for example, monkeys. (2) I do not think vivisection should be
allowed for demonstration of facts already discovered. (8) It is doubtful
whether, in philr‘)s01')hical research, the zoijphilists would be competent judges
of the ofﬁces for which vivisection is justiﬁable.”

From Rev. Dr. THOMAS C. HALL, Chicago, Ill. :—-—
“I believe the best thing the State could do would be to restrict the right

of vivisection to responsible persons, and to control carefully the institutions
under whose direct-ions such persons worked.”

From President Gr. STANLEY HALL, Clark University : ~—

“I hesitate somewhat between statements II. and III. I have no hesita-
tion in dissenting from I. and IV. I do not quite wish to put myself on
record as agreeing with either of the positions. It is very rarely justiﬁable
to operate for more demonstration, but I am not ready to see that absolutely
forbidden on all animals. I believe most experiments can be made painless,
but a few of the cardinal tests cannot; so that I should not have this abso-
lutely forbidden.”

From H. H. A. BEACH, M. 1)., Surgeon, Massachusetts General
Hospital:—

1 “I am unwilling to sign either of the four statements. Viviseetion without
»' restriction I regard as an abomination, and the laws which permit sin-h a
practice a blot upon the country that makes them. Vivisection restricted by
utility I should sign, but there is no rule for excluding the clause, ‘ Science
must prove that advantage and that neeessity.’ ”

From Hon. J. S. VVILLTS, M. C. : —

" allowable to mankind under restrictions to investigate all subjects that con-
eern the welfare of the human family. . . . Utility should be a condition and

prerogative of Vivisection. The simple play of human fancy or curiosity
should be discarded in testing and teaching so intricate a subject.

“There are other ﬁelds sufﬁciently wide and varied in which science may
amuse itself, without attacking the citadel of animal life.

“It is doubtful if Vivisection should be allowed at all, unless it can be per-
formed without pain. Science is not warranted to inﬂict pain upon the basis
of mere experiment. \Vhere the use of anaesthetics can preclude the occur-
rence of pain, experiment for purposes of utility is allowable. Pain can never
be banished from this world, and mankind must suffer its full share ; and it is
unphilosophical to add to the horrors of commiseration by uselessly involving
the inferior animals in the toils of exaggerated science.”

From Pres. N. H. Chamberlin, A. M., LL.B., McKendrie College,
Illinois:—

“I should be inclined to strike out in the second paragraph these words,
‘but whether anyuseful knowledge can be acquired or not is beside the
question.’ I should rest the whole proposition on the moral quality of the
act, without any statement of inducement implied in the clause struck out.”

Sir WALTER B'ESANT, Author, England. : —-

“I am not a scientiﬁc man, nor can I test the statements and claims
advocated in favor of Vivisection; but to cut and hack living creatures with-
out the strongest possible reasons, or to suffer any irresponsible anatomist
to do so without the strongest possible expectations, without anaesthetics, is
unspeakably shocking and horrible.”

RICHARD H. HUTTON, M.A., LL.D., Editor of the “ Spectator/K

London, England : —

“ Vivisection should be allowable if without any pain greater than is
inﬂicted in putting to death in a humane fashion. This is the only answer
which seems to me maintainable by any one who thinks it right to kill the
lower animals for man’s beneﬁt; and to this answer I adhere.”

Hon. AREA N. WATERMAN, Illinois Appellate Court, Chicago, Ill. :

“ Avilization in its moral aspect consists in a heightened sympathy with
and consideration for those men or animals in our power. It is impossible to
train a child to indifference as regards the suffering of a helpless dog,» and at
the same time mindful of the rights of little children.

“ It is immaterial whether he who proposes to torture be an ignorant
savage or a distinguished savant. The aim of each is the same. The carter
who pounds his horse, the boy who torments a kitten, and the scientist who
twists the quivering nerves of a helpless dog are each, in his own way, on-
deavoring to promote ‘human happiness.’ Whoever believes his work to be

. of supreme importance will naturally become cruel. To whomsoever in the
cause of science the agony of a (lying rabbit is of no consequence, it is likely
that the old or worthless man will soon be a thing which in the cause of learn-
ing may well be sacriﬁced. There is no reason for thinking that Torquemada
or Robespierre were naturally any more cruel than the educators who endeavor
to add brilliancy and piquancy to their lectures by an exhibition of the manner

in which a dumb brute behaves when disseCted alive. Viviseetion should be
permitted only to competent and trustworthy persons, and restricted to
licensed places which shall be open at all times to inspection by the Presi-
dents Of Humane Societies for Protection of Animals, or their authorized
representatives. ’ ’ V

OUIDA, Author, Florence, Italy : —

“ Should ever such an opinion as that implied in the statement for vivi—
section without restriction become that of mankind in general, the world will
be a hell indeed. The pretensions of what are called scientists are a menace
to all liberty, peace, and virtue, and the doctrines thereof followed out from
youth to age would make of the earth a shamble.”

From H. R. BRISSETT, M. D., Lowell, Mass. : —-

“Statements I. and II. I pass over as in no way tenable. Statement III.
contains an “ if.” Anaesthesia is good while it lasts, but I have Often seen it
pass off, and the experimenter go on with the work in hand Without renewing
it; and all the class saw with revulsion that there was real torture in the case.
So I think absolutely, with such men as Tait and Bigelow, that vivisection
subserves no good purpose, and has only theory (vague at that) to support it.”

From CLAYTON L. HILL, M. D., Buffalo, N. Y.: ——

“I know from personal experience that medical and surgical research
does not demand the fearful suffering and waste of life that is entailed upon
the lower animals. I have seen many hundreds of vivisections, and not one
of them developed a new truth or an idea not already well established.
Viviseetion as practised in medical schools is simply a sort Of theatrical per-
formance for the benefit of the students and the glory of the professors.”

From JOHN C. DU BOIs, A. M., M. D., Late Surgeon in the U. S.

Army : ——

“During three years of student life in Paris, I. saw a good deal Of torture
to animals in unnecessary demonstrations to students of well-known facts,
and I heard stories of Magendie’s cruelties. A good deal of sentimental
nonsense has been written and spoken upon vivisection ; yet there have been
abuses, and the beneﬁts such experiments have conferred do not palliate
them. I am anxious for a proper and legal settlement of this subject.”

FI‘Om'LUIGI GALVANI DOANE, M. D., New York City: ——

“Put me down as the antagonist of vivisection in any form. The ofﬁce
of the physician is to heal wounds and to save life, not to take it.”

From GEORGE H. PAYNE, M. D., Boston, Mass. :———

“I believe fully that we have no right to torture God’s dumb creatures,

and that it does little or no good to experiment upon animals.”

J. W. THOMSON, M. D., New York City: ——

“ we do not believe that vivisection ever gave knowledge that led to the
relief of a single human being from pain, or‘in any way helped to ameliorate
human suffering. This diabolical practice is totally needless as well as das-

tardly inhuman. No man who has been guilty of vivisection ought to be
allowed to practise as a physician. Imagine any one coming from a torture-
chamber to see a sick child, or to have a mission to help suffering humanity!
How can one who is callous to animal suffering yearn to help his fellow—man?
. What can be learned from the quivering, writhing ﬂesh for intelligent guid-
ance for the sick? Do the tissues, laid open by the lance, display normal
function ? Assuredly not. What is the story that a humane mind would read?
The only true one of which we can conceive is the palpitating plea for mercy,
unheeded by the inhuman wretch who, in the name of a false science, gloats
, , like a ghoul over his ﬁendish, bloody work.”

From JAMES P. HAWES, M. D., North Hector, N. Y. : ——

“ . . . I have seen dogs kept howling and starving, with large doses of
chloral injected in one side and strychnine in the other side; some lived
and some died. What did it prove? In one of our leading colleges, I have
seen a calf split open and a little ﬂag-staff stuck in the heart for the ediﬁca-
‘tion of the students! What did that prove of the human heart? Enough
accidents happen to poor humanity to test the results of pain and wounds,
burns and scalds, freezing and anaesthesia, without inﬂiction on the poor
brute.”

From A. ROSE, M. D., New York: —— . ‘

“There can be no nobler cause than the prevention of cruelty to animals
in vivisection. During the Middle Ages tortures were inflicted under the
very eyes and strict supervision of awfully learned physicians, and thus we
see that learning does not prevent us from doing cruelty. \Ve have to be
reminded of this example.”

CHARLES W. SUP-ER, President of Ohio University: —-

“ 'While I am not quite ready to say that vivisection should be entirely
prohibited, I am very strongly inclined to this opinion ; but I am entirely ready
to say that scientiﬁc research ought not to be free and untrammelled. The
humanitarian interests of the world are paramount to any and every other.
Scientiﬁc investigators sometimes become veritable monomaniacs in their
search for knowledge and as indifferent to the highest interests of their fellow-

:j 3

 

men as other lunatics. .If under the ‘untrammelled-research’ regime, my
neighbor seems to be a better subject for investigation than his dog, I ought
as a matter of consistency to experiment on the man rather than the brute.
It is not hard to see whither such consistency would lead. I am glad to see
that the vigorous agitation of this subject is leading to what I consider Whole-
some legislation.”

Hon. ROWLAND B. MAHANY, M. C. :—- ..

“ Enough cruelty is already being practised upon dumb animals without
legalizing what at best may be termed ‘experimental torture.’ . . . Even
under the scalpel of the ablest operator, it is a grave question of doubt ; -.
whether any permanent beneﬁt to science is acquired by the process of vivi— ,
section.” ' ,i

 

 




EXTRACTS FROM LETTERs. 71

Right Rev. GEORGE F. SEYMOUR, LL.D., Bishop of Springﬁeld:

“I consider that the animated world beneath man is a sacred trust com—
mitted to him by the Creator, and for the right and just administration of
which he will be held sternly accountable. Hence, I would place very severe
restrictions upon vivisection, and allow its practice only in cases where it
was employed for settling questions which we have gOOd reason to believe
could not be answered except by such experiments. I would exclude abso-
lutely, and forbid under penalty by law, all exhibitions to students Of vivi-
section as illustrating ascertained and recorded facts Of science.”

' , From President \V. P. JOHNSTON, Geneva College, Pa. 2 —— ' .

“ My opposition to vivisection is not so much because of, the pain to the
animal dissected (it dies in a little while), but because Of injury to the moral
nature Of the animal dissecting, that lives probably for many years, and has
other chances on other animals than dogs and cats ! ”

From JOHN H. KEYSER, HARTFORD, 001111.: —

“I was superintendent Of the Stranger’s Hospital in New York at a time
when vivisection was freely practised upon animals by young student phy-
sicians. From that experience I formed the Opinion that it was wicked,
wanton, and cruel to clothe these young and inexperienced men with des- ‘
. potic power over animals, and I forbade the practice. Mercy towards the j
helpless brute creation is, in my judgment, ample argument against vivisec— j
tion, and it ought to cease.” ‘

From JOHN BOARDMAN, M. D., Buffalo, N. Y. : ——

“I do not believe that any real good comes tO the ordinary student from
class vivisection. On the other hand, in my Opinion, the humane part of man
is injured and the diabolical part comes nearer to the surface.”

From THOMAS B. FOWLER, M. D., Cohocton, N. Y. : -—

“Ido not think the impression left on the mind Of the average medical
student as a result Of witnessing the mutilation of animals is one that really
adds to his available store Of knowledge, or tends to aid him in prescribing
for suffering humanity. It is impossible to estimate the baneful effects Of
such experiences on the minds of men whose actions are largely governed by
impulse or propensity.”

ther quotations from the numerous letters received. It is possible that many Of them
