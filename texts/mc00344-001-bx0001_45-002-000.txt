two-ton, nineteen-foot killer whale
heaves itself from the water. Children
scream; even the most distracted chap-
erons stare spellbound. The whale takes
one look at his fans, turns in midair and
does a ﬂop calculated to send sheets of
spray over the shrieking audience.

It’s show time at Shamu Stadium.

For many families the killer whale show
is the highlight of their visit to this watery
Disneyland, sufﬁcient compensation for
the hefty admission fee (almost $60 for a
family of four). One of San Diego’s best-
known tourist attractions, Sea World is
owned by the publishing company Har-
court Brace Jovanovich (HBJ) and takes
in an estimated $127.5 million annually
from visitors eager to see the whales. Of
the 8.5 million tourists who come to Sea
World’s three marine parks in San Diego,
Aurora, Ohio, and Orlando, Florida,
each year, 95 percent have seen the killer
whale show. Shamu, the starring whale
(actually several whales play the lead),
has amassed such a following he has be-
come Sea World’s corporate symbol. Last
May the company opened its new Shamu
Stadium in San Diego, the world’s largest
marine mammal habitat, and in 1988 Sea
World will launch a fourth park in San
Antonio, Texas. Shamu’s likeness is em-
blazoned on every Sea World brochure,
business card and advertisement. The
whale is, in short, a superstar.

Like most superstars, Shamu is hot
property. The animals are estimated by
whale researchers to be worth between
$500,000 and $1 million apiece—if they
can be had for sale or captured without in-
terference from federal rule or public op-
position. So crucial is the whale to Sea
World’s prosperity that when the park

was denied the opportunity to capture a
hundred whales for breeding and re-
search, HBJ eventually bought Palos
Verdes’ Marineland for $23 . 4 million, dis-
mantled the park and moved its animals,
including killer whales Orky and Corky,
to San Diego. Killer whales have only
been in captivity for two decades, but the
shows are a source of major proﬁt.

The whales are also the source of a
major controversy. Does man have the
right to capture and
display these ani-
mals or use them for
scientiﬁc research?
Armed with con-
trary notions of
what the whale is or
isn’t, sea-life parks
and environmental-
ists are quick to take
sides in what has be-
come a heated polit-
ical battle. Dave
Butcher, Sea World’s
vice president of
animal behavior,
claims people have
romanticized the
whale into a fantasy
as remote as an alien
takeover. On the
other hand, scien-
tists like Dr. Paul
Spong, founder of Save the Whales, an
organization seeking to halt whale kill-
ings, argues that man can learn from
the animal’s behavior, especially from
its social harmony, and that man has no
justiﬁcation for caging it. Few involved
in the argument don’t have strong opin-
ions; hence even the most informed can
be guided as much by emotion as by
fact. In the end all conﬂicting theories

a central question: does the mammal
have an inherent right to freedom?

AVE BUTCHER STANDS on the

Shamu Stadium stage watching a

trainer kneel at the water’s edge,

face-to-face with a killer whale.

The young woman, clad in a Sea
World wet suit, is talking to the animal,
rubbing its head and occasionally pat-
ting it on the tongue in what Butcher
calls a “relation-
ship session.”

“I remember be-
ing out here in the
early seventies and
having the whales
totally ignore me,”
he reminisces. The
whales didn’t pay at—
tention, Butcher
says, because their
environment was
too consistent. So he
developed a training
technique new to
the discipline -just
one way, he claims,
that Sea World has
advanced the sci-
ence of killer
whales. The secret
of persuading the
animal to perform is
to keep it interested: killer whales are
not coercible. The problem of using
herring as reinforcement for good be-
havior is that it’s boring— once the ani-
mal is fed, the game is over. Butcher de-
cided to use human interaction to re-
ward the whales, and he developed a
system wherein his every move would
be unpredictable. He deﬁned ﬁve types
of training sessions known as PLESR
(pronounced pleasure): play, in which

OLGA VON ZIEGESAR

 




anything goes; learning, when new be-
haviors are taught; exercise; socializa-
tion, in which animals interact with
several trainers to simulate a pod (the
whale’s stable family unit); and rela-
tionship, when the animal and trainer
spend time one-on-one to strengthen
their bond. Sessions are scheduled at
random, and Butcher keeps a weekly
log of all interactions between whales
and trainers; if he sees any patterns
emerging, he eliminates them. If a
whale misbehaves, Butcher and his
trainers retaliate by staring at it—a
two-second slap of boredom. To further
avoid predictability, no one animal can
play the lead all the time. “They all play
Shamu,” says Butcher. “Otherwise we’d
have superconsistency there as well.”

According to Butcher and his supervi-
sor, Lanny Cornell, Sea World’s zoolog-
ical director, the whales are as content in
the park as they are in the wild. They are
fed, doctored and amused; they are pro-
tected from ﬁshermen who compete with
them for a day’s catch. At Sea World the
needs of the animals come ﬁrst. The
irony in any controversy, says Cornell, is
that without Sea World few people
would know or care about killer whales.
It’s only because Sea World has done
such a good job educating the public and
researching the animal (the park funds
the Hubbs Marine Research Center)
that opposition has become possible.

As Butcher continues talking, trainers
burst onto center stage and start throw-
ing water at each other. The whales are
lined up instantly at the pool’s edge,
heads out of the water, mouths open
wide. Trainers dump buckets of water
into the whales’ mouths, and the ani-
mals clearly love it. When the trainers
disappear just as unexpectedly, they
linger near the exit; one swims to a side

pool and peers through a closed gate as
if to watch for the trainers’ return.
“You can see the whale pay atten-
tion,” says Butcher. “The trainers may
come back after 30 seconds and say,
‘Okay, here we go again.’ Or theycould
be gone half an hour. The whales never
know.” Above all, he’d like his tech-
nique to provide the whales with the
variability found in nature. The hard-

, est thing about his system, he says, is

coming up with new stimuli to simulate
the whale’s natural environment.

To Sea World’s critics, the notion that
the park re-creates a whale’s natural envi-

ronment is laughable. Save the Whales’
Spong claims Sea World sentences its
whales to a life of sensory deprivation;
they become cut off from the ocean’s
acoustical diversity and are forced to
live in a tank where all sound bounces
off concrete walls. He believes these
conditions lead to the captive whales’
high mortality rate, a major point of
contention between environmentalists
and the sea-life park. Critics complain
that in the 19703 Sea World’s captured
whales seldom survived more than
seven years; according to a federal
Marine Mammal Inventory Report, 12

CALIFORNIA MAGAZINE 61

 




of Sea World’s 24 whales have died since
December 1965. (These days whales live
an average of 22 years at Sea World.)
And even though the park has publicized
the successful breeding of its two-year-
old Baby Shamu, the ﬁrst surviving
killer whale born in captivity, others
have been stillborn or have lived only a
short time.

The question as to whether captivity
shortens a whale’s life is hotly debated,
for no one knows
how long a whale
lives. Some scien-
tists estimate 100
years; Sea World
believes the killer
whale’s lifespan is
closer to 30 years.
Michael Biggs, a
marine biologist for
Canada’s Depart-
ment of Fisheries
and Oceans, has
been monitoring
whale populations
for ﬁfteen years.
Based on tooth-ag-
ing studies, he con-
cludes the killer
whale lives 50 to 70
years — as long as its
close relative, the
pilot whale. Biggs
has also reconstructed whales’ family
trees and found females require fifteen
years to mature, reproduce for 25 more,
then act as “grannies,” or caretakers, in
the pod for another ﬁfteen years.

Cornell dismisses Biggs’s research; he
claims females can reproduce at an ear-
lier age and that evidence shows whales’
teeth deteriorate so fast after they reach
30 they may well die of starvation by the
age of 40. Although Cornell admits Sea
World has made mistakes during its
brief existence, he says the whales enjoy
better health there than in the wild; they
don’t have to hunt for food or suffer from
parasites or the liver, kidney and lung
infections that usually plague them.
“You can go to our facilities and listen to
the animals talk to each other. They’re
having a good time out there,” he says.

But even if Sea World can prove that
whales survive in captivity with few
physical consequences, another more
emotional issue is at stake: is the whale a
mammal of superior intelligence? If so,
does man have any right to capture such
a being? Or has man’s inclination to an-
thropomorphize the animal swayed him
in his research?

Cornell and Butcher place the killer

whale’s intelligence on the same level as ‘

the chimp’s, arguing that the animal’s
extremely large brain (6,000 cubic cen-
timeters as compared with the human
brain’s 1,300 cubic centimeters) is used
mainly for echolocation, the method by
which whales detect their prey. But Sea

World’s critics, including Howard Ro-
senfeld, retired director of Washington
State’s well-known Whale Museum,
argue that the whale’s highly convo-
luted additional cortex envelops a neo-
cortex similar to a human’s. “We don’t
know what the use of that brain is,” he
says. “We see that they have a very
complex social behavior in the wild,
and we wonder what the overall impact
of captivity on the animals is.”
Rosenfeld’s col—
league Richard Os-
borne, the Whale
Museum’s director
of research, has
been studying the
whales in Washing—
ton’s Puget Sound
and is quick to point
to social behavior as
evidence of the ani-
mal’s advanced in-
telligence.- He sees
social awareness in
a remarkable ritual
he calls a greeting
ceremony.
“When two pods
have been sepa-
rated for a day and
come back in con-
I tact, they line up on

the surface facing
each other in two horizontal lines and
sit there for a few seconds,” he explains.
“Then they dive down and break into
little swarms of whales. Each whale
goes around rolling on top of each other
whale. So they have a greeting with
every whale present.”

This greeting ceremony is followed
by a play session where the whales per-
form feats unseen in aquarium shows,
as the animals need huge expanses of
water to accelerate. They race through
the ocean, then stick their pectoral ﬁns
into a stop position, causing their entire
bodies to launch out of the water in a
giant arc, a kind of whale cartwheel.

It is this exuberant, highly evolved
social life, argue Sea World’s critics,
that suggests removing a young whale
from a pod creates a stressful separation
and disrupts the pod’s close-knit social
fabric. Osborne also believes the ani—
mal’s social behavior bespeaks its high
level of intelligence. Rather than kick
young males out of the pod, the whales
he observed solve the problem of in-
breeding through social means. They
send their young to other pods to have
intercourse, often during an afternoon
play session. “After they’re through,
they go home to mom,” he says.

Obsorne also notes differences in the
vocalization dialects between different
populations of killer whales that may
also support _a claim for their intelli-
gence. “It’s like the difference between
Chinese and English. Pods that inter-

act share some calls, but otherwise
there’s no overlap. And calves don’t
sound like adults, which suggests that
the vocal repertoire is learned from
birth, a sure indication of smarts.”

Butcher disagrees. The question of
killer whale communication, he says, is
simply overblown. “Dogs communi-
cate—you see them duck their heads,
wag their tails, bark. They’ve got to be
saying something. All kinds of animals
communicate with one another. It
doesn’t mean they’ve become some
highly complex organism on earth and
they understand more than people.”

A senior research assistant at the Sea
World Research Institute and a PhD.
candidate at the Scripps Oceanographic
Institute, Ann Bowles has been tracking
Baby Shamu’s vocalizations, trying to
match sounds to behavior. She’s certain
whales are as sophisticated as humans in
perceiving their environment, perhaps
more so because they may not be dis-
tracted by a sense of past or future. “But
I don’t expect there’s a tradition of stories
carried on from mother to son about
what happened in the dim, dark dawn of
cetacean time,” she says. “We don’t see
any sign that this kind of information is
being passed on.” Bowles thinks study—
ing the animals in captivity may be the
only way to research them because it
takes hundreds of hours to dig up a bit of
information in the ﬁeld. She points out
that if left alone in the wild, the whale
could become an endangered species.

Osborne and Spong vehemently dis-
agree. They are independently work-
ing on techniques for studying killer
whale vocalizations in the wild, Os-
borne in Puget Sound and Spong at his
ORCALAB in British Columbia. Os-
borne feels the problem transcends a
question of research difﬁculties. “I
mean, the Grand Canyon is a fantastic
thing, but there’s no way you can stick
it in an aquarium. People have learned
to accept that you either watch a movie
about it, read a book or go and visit.”
Let the animals go, exhorts Spong.
What we see in the marine park is only
a circus performer, he notes, a carica—
ture of the animal. We see none of the
majesty it possesses in the ocean.

OR ONCE THE sun was shining

on the calm waters of Puget

Sound. Ralph Munro, assistant

to Washington governor Dan
Evans, set out with his wife and neigh-
bors for a Sunday sail around the bay.
As their boat neared the state capital
Olympia, lVIunro heard the disruptive
sound of explosives emanating from
several high-speed powerboats gath—
ered on Budd Inlet, a shallow cove at
the tip of Puget Sound; overhead, an
airplane circled repeatedly. A local
whale trapper hired by Sea World to
round up killer whales had ﬁnally
tracked down the pod he’d been hunting
for weeks and had cornered it in Budd
Inlet. The capture .boats began loading
the whales one by one, detonating un-
derwater explosives to keep the animals
cowering in the nets. Munro watched
as the hunters dropped more than a
hundred devices in ﬁve minutes. “It was

one of the most gruesome sights I’ve 2
ever seen,” he says. “They just harassed ~

the hell out of those animals.”
If the scientiﬁc arguments had seemed
no more than an academic exercise, the

very real political battle over whales was i

initiated by this, Sea World’s ﬁrst ofﬁcial
capture on March 7, 1976. That same
day, Puget Sound’s Evergreen College
was hosting the First International Orca
Symposium on the banks of Budd Inlet,
within sight of the captures. A better
group to demonstrate against the activ-
ity couldn’t have been more readily
available; their intense weeklong protest
quickly galvanized public opinion
against Sea World. Munro brought his
objections to Governor Evans, who im—
mediately called for release of the whales.
After a week of hearings, reversals and
appeals, Sea World signed an agreement
on March 23, 1976, to let the whales go
and never again “exercise its right. . .to
take any killer whales within the waters of
the state of Washington.”

Sea World’s Cornell concedes that,
for the time being, the Washington
whale population is best left alone.
“There’s been a kind of agreement
among all parties that no captures will
occur in Washington, but there is no
real ban on it,” he explains.

Munro, currently Washington’s secre-
tary of state, assesses the situation differ-
ently. “Once again Lanny Cornell is not
telling the truth,” he says. “Sea World
signed an agreement never to seek per-
mits in Washington again. When we
took them to court, all the evidence
about the whales they killed before 1976
started to come out, about previous
operations where they wrapped an-
chors around dead whales, slit their
bellies and sunk them. . .they settled
[the case] real quick.”

Cornell denies Sea World had any-
thing to do with whale deaths prior to
1976. “I would like to have Mr. Munro
testify under oath someday,” he growls.
“I think he might go to jail.” The Whale
Museum’s Rosenfeld backs Munro’s
accusations, claiming Sea World cap-
tured whales before 1976 and buried
those that died by ﬁlling them with
rocks. “We only know about the ones
that didn’t stay sunk. It was not a very
proud moment for Sea World when
they came back up,” he says.

Despite the problems in Washington,
Sea World took its search for enough
whales to stock its parks elsewhere. In
1985 the park received a permit from the
National Marines Fisheries Service
(NMFS) to capture Alaskan whales.
Once again, the park clashed with the
opposition in another lawsuit, this time
from the Organized Resistance to Cap-
ture in Alaska (ORCA), founded by Dr.
Paul Simpson. His group not only op-
posed the ten captures Sea World sought
but also protested its plan to study 90
other whales.

“Sea World would have you believe
this was completely benign research,”
Simpson says. “They proposed punch—
ing holes through [the whales’] dorsal
ﬁns and bolting on radio transmitters,
stapling streamer tags onto their ﬁns. . . .
They wanted to put hoses down into
their stomachs to remove the contents,
do liver biopsies, which involves stick-
ing a big needle into the liver and taking
the core out, and they wanted to remove
teeth from the whales for aging studies.
The echolocation mechanism is found
primarily in the jaw, and scientists were
concerned this would result in jaw infec-
tions that could disrupt the whales’ abil-
ity to navigate and ﬁnd food.”

ORCA claims such invasive mea-
sures require an environmental impact
study; in a lawsuit ﬁled by the Sierra
Club, the state court held such a study
was necessary. Both Sea World and the
NMFS state the capture permit is still
valid, that the court merely found a pro-
cedural error. But since its recent acqui-
sition of Marineland’s Corky and Orky
and one other breeding male from Ma-
rineland in Niagara Falls, Cornell says
Sea World will only continue its capture
efforts in Alaska after it succeeds at breed-
ing several more whales in captivity.

ORCA’s Simpson threatens that if Sea
World does come north, the marine park
will have to resume battle. He knows of
one person who has already mounted a
small deck cannon on his sailboat to shoot
orange-juice cans ﬁlled with concrete—-
shots weighty enough to penetrate a
boat’s hull. Others have conﬁrmed they
are ready to set out in their boats armed
with riﬂes to halt the captures.

Munro sums up the fervor of Sea
World’s opponents in the Paciﬁc North-

? west. “To have the gall to think they’re

going to take Alaskan whales down to
Southern California and jump them
through hoops and then charge people
to get in the gate to see them. . . . I think
the state legislature in Alaska will meet
them on the docks if nothing else.”

S THE LATE—afternoon shad-
ows reach across San Diego’s
Shamu Stadium, the whales
are performing their fourth
and ﬁnal show, a leisurely day’s work
compared to the seven or eight perfor-
mances staged daily during the summer
months. One of the trainers is explain—
ing the genesis of these performances;
in 1966, he announces, the whales were
viewed as vicious killers, so progress in
training was slow and cautious.

“Then one trainer took a daring step,
and once he started he knew there was
no turning back,” he cries as another
trainer steps onto one of the whales and
rides it around the pool. “All of a sud-
den he was on the back of a killer whale,
and he realized through trust, patience
and understanding, his relationship with
Shamu had taken him further than he’d
ever dreamed possible.”

In a sense, Sea World has been riding
on Shamu’s back ever since, and HBj
has prospered greatly from its maritime
acquisitions. So if the star occasionally
becomes temperamental—as happened
three days after this particular show,
when a Shamu pinned a trainer against a
wall— it’s a problem to be resolved as all
business problems must.

Butcher admits whales have pushed
him underwater or have grabbed him
with their mouths a number of times.
It’s just a game, he says, and to end it
the trainer simply submits to the ani-
mal. As soon as a whale understands it
has total control, it lets go.

It’s a hell of a way to make a living,
but the audience loves it, HBj loves it
and there are those who claim, backed
by sincere and objective scientiﬁc argu-
ments, that the whales like it, too. So
despite the occasional outbursts of
aggression from the stars, the show goes
on. Unless, that is, at some point in the
future someone—biologist,» environ-
mentalist, whale lover— is able to prove
once and for all that the show’s star has
no right to be the star, but instead, the
right to be free. -

Trappers do brisk business,

 

 

 

despite worry over protests

 

By JEFF BRADLEY

Fort Rae, Northwest Territo-
ries —AP— A Dog Rib Indian
trapper with a sack of 200 musk-
rat pelts made his way past the
dry goods and stereos to a rear
counter in the Hudson’s Bay Co.
store in this settlement on Great
Slave Lake.

He doesn’t need to say a word
to the manager, who examines the
furs and peels off $770 in cash.

The Indian smiles as he stuffs
the bills into his jacket. Thanks to
a resurgence in the fur coat indus-
try from Toronto to Tokyo, it was
the best price in years.

Near the store, two more Indi-
ans have brought in 330 muskrat
pelts from traplines in the snow-
covered bush of Canada’ 8 sprawl-
ing Northwest Territories.

“It only took us a week. We set
150 traps,” says Leon Weyallon,
. 26, unloading snowmobiles and
sleds outside his government-sub-
sidized house.

His wife was watching a soap
open on color television while an
older woman was scraping pelts
and turning them inside out on
stretch-boards for drying. A cruci-
fix and photos of priests hang on
the wall.

Despite satellite TV from
Detroit and Catholicism brought
by missionaries, most of the 1,500
Dog Ribs in this largest Indian
town in the Territories still live
close to the land, trading with
Hudson’s Bay as their ancestors
did 300 years ago when the white
man first came in search of furs.

The trade in beaver, fox, mar-
ten and other furs provides a live-
lihood for some 100,000 trappers
across Canada, including many of
the 27,000 Indians, Inuit (Eskimos)
and half-caste Metis in the isolated
communities of the Arctic North
where other sources of income are
scarce.

Although fur prices are good
this season, Indians below the tree
line and Eskimos above it are
increasingly worried about ani-
malarights and conservation
groups campaigning in Europe and
America to stop the killing of
wildlife and alleged “inhumane”
trapping.

It’s a complaint few natives
understand.

“I never met an Indian opposed
to trapping,” says Chipewyan
Chief Felix Lockhart of Snowdrift.

The International Fund for Ani-
,mal Welfare and similar groups

 

 

urge governments to ban fur
imports and shoppers to switch to
synthetics and in 1983 the Europe-
an Economic Community felt com-
pelled to impose a ban on seal
skins — used to make fur coats
and for leather goods.

The decision deprived New-
foundland sealers of one-third of
their income and forced 1,500
Inuit hunters onto welfare. Within

“Our way of life has been going

‘member Dene Indian Nation.

“We don’t hunt for the fun of

of the Keewatin Inuit Association

along Hudson Bay.

develop traps that will kill animals
quickly, lessening their pain.

The counter-propaganda cam-
paign seems to be paying off. The
Swedish Parliament recently
defeated a bill to ban the import of
trapped furs after Canada present-
ed its case.

Even more important, designers
in America, Europe and the Far
East are choosing furs again and
finding buyers.

“Furs are back in style and
there are new markets opening
up,” says Toronto wholesaler Jack
Kuretzky, 66, whose company

roduces 200 fur coats a week.

have ever had.”

';Shandar was reported missing at
5:50 pm. Friday after she had been
playing in the Semotans’ back yard
with Semotan-’5 husband, Roger.

EEThe dog, who was not wearing a
collar or tags, ran around the side of
the house and vanished down the
street. The Semotans had been caring
for the dog while their daughter and
sop-in-law were away for the week-
end.

:fJoAnne Semotan reported the
missing dog to police and organized a
group of friends and neighbors to
search the area.

{About 15 minutes after police
received Semotan’s call, they
received another call from a person
who thought he had seen a pit bull
terrier foaming at the mouth and
running loose east of S. 128th St.
near W. Manitoba Ave. .

.According to police reports:

The two officers spotted the
shar-pei near New Berlin Memorial
Hospital. Shandar ran in the direction
of a young woman who was walking
through the parking lot toward the
hospital, but changed direction after
the woman reached the hospital

door. The officers thought the dog
was the pit bull and was dangerous.

They finally cornered Shandar in
a residence in the 3100 block of S.
Sunnyslope Rd. Police Cpl. Gregory
Erdman shot the dog twice with his
lZ-gauge shotgun. -

At this point I felt we had no
other option under the circumstanc-
es, and I shot the dog with the squad
shotgun from a distance of 30 yards,”
Erdman said in the police report.

“The dog was completely foamed
up at the mouth and its tongue was
hanging out,” the police report said.
“The tongue was drooping 4 to 6
inches out of the mouth and the dog
had no collar or tags.”

Drooling is often a sign of rabies,
but Semotan said shar—peis drooled
constantly because of the deep holes
around their mouth.

After the dog was dead, the offi-
cers learned of the report of the
missing shar-pei and brought Shan-
dar to the Semotan home, where she
was identified.

Shar-peis are distinguished by .
their extremely baggy, wrinkled
skin. Pit bull terriers have smooth
skin, short hair and larger, broader
mouths.

Pit bulls frequently are used in
dog fights, but also have been known
to viciously attack people, especially
young children.

Medical school hit
on animal research

 

 

By NEIL D. ROSENBERG

Journal medical reporter

Among the 21,447 animals used in
medical research or education in
1986 at the Medical College of Wis-
consin were 9.490 mice, 7,787 rats,
1,465 dogs, 401 cats, 208 quail, 64
opossums, 9 pigs, a sheep and a goat.

And the Citizens United for Ani-
mals, a Milwaukee-based animal pro-
tection group, is not happy about
that.

On Friday evening, an estimated
140 members and sympathizers pro-
tested with poetry and a candle vigil
at the medical college, 8701 W.
Watertown Plank Rd.. Wauwatosa.
About 140 people turned out, the
Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment estimated.

Earlier last week, the group pre-
sented a six-point plan to Edward
Lennon, college president, to reduce
the use of animals in medical
research:

I Publicly ask the National Insti-
tutes of Health to increase funding
for research technologies that do not
harm or kill animals. [Computers
sometimes are used in place of ani-
mals.]

I issue a clear policy that stu-
dents do not have to dissect animals.

I Allow unannounced inspections
by animal rights officials.

I End the use of lost and aban-
doned pets in research.

I End psychological tests on ani-
mals.

I Start discussions with repre-
sentatives of the animal rights move-
ment to develop a plan to phase out
reliance on the experimental use of
animals.

Richard Katschke, director of
public affairs for the medical college
responded to the points Friday in an
intervimv

He said the National Institutes of
Health already required researchers
to develop non-animal models when
possible in research projects. He also
said it made more sense to allocate
the limited resources of the health
institutes to fighting diseases in
humans than to transfer them to
finding alternative methods for using
animals in research.

The medical college does not
require students to dissect animals it
it is against their conscience, he said.
But students who decline still are
responsible for mastering the knowl-
edge required by such dissection.

Katschke said the school opposed
unannounced inspections because
“anti-vivisectionists nationwide have
proven to be disruptive when they
have been allowed access to research
facilities.” Vivisection is the formal
name for surgical operations or
experiments on live animals. ~

He said the school also opposed
escorted inspections by animal rights
advocates because they then would
learn the location of the animals and
the security system, and later might
try to enter illegally.

' “We cannot risk a security breach
in our facility,” he said.

Katschke also said the college
would continue to use animals for
psychological testing because such
research had been deemed crucial by
the National Mental Health Associa-
tion in understanding mental disor-
ders in humans.

The school does use unclaimed
strays, but they make up less than
1% of all the animals used, he said.
He said it would “insensitive to
destroy unclaimed animals [in
pounds] while breeding other animals
for research. That way there would
be twice as many animals dying.”

Must animals
always serve
human ends?

By SPENCE CARLSEN

 

 

fortable around things that they

don’t easily understand. Some-
times, amid all the discussion that
surrounds it, a new idea is either
misunderstood completely or not
understood at all. Such confusion
surrounds the idea that non-human
animals have rights. Many people
think that this is either too ridiculous
to be taken seriously or too compli-
cated for anyone except philosoo
phers. As usual, this kind of polariza-
tion disguises the much simpler truth
of the matter: if human animals have
rights, such as the right to life’, so do
non-human animals.

A common mistake, and a proba-
ble cause of much of the confusion, is
the belief that human animals are
radically different creatures from
non-human animals. We are raised
from childhood to see other animals
as creatures that are in some way
less than human and distinctly sepa-
rate from us by nature. Most of us
never even see animals, other than
dogs and cats, except in pictures or
zoos. Our separation is physical as
well as mental.

We think about animals as objects
whose purpose in the order of things
is to serve human ends. We learn a
whole set of unquestioned beliefs and
a very specialized vocabulary that
keep us from realizing the abuses
that non-human animals undergo to
satisfy these ends. A cow who has
been killed, skinned, dismembered
and ground up or sliced is “beef,”
“leather,” “hindquarter,” “hamburg-
er.” A laboratory rat is a “research
tool” or “model.” A deer or a fox on a
wildlife “refuge” becomes a
“resource” deserving of “conserva-
tion.” Using these words, it is hard, if
not impossible, to understand non-
human animals as creatures that, like
ourselves, experience pain and suf-
fering and have complicated emo-
tional lives.

Most of us know that what we do
to animals we would never do to
people. We understand that people
have certain rights that keep them
from being eaten, worn or experi-
mented on by other people. What we
don’t realize, until we really examine
our beliefs about animals, is that
these rights cannot belong exclusive-
ly to human beings. There is no
non-arbitrary way to exclude such
things as the right to life from non-
human animals.

P EOPLE are nervous and uncom-

THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL Friday, April 24, 1987

In order to continue to do what
we have always done, we dream up
excuses to hide the holder truth. The
excuses range from the unscientific
“God gave them to us to use” to the
pseudo-scientific “Animals are
machines, not substantially different
from clocks in their working.” These
mind-boggling distortions prevent
most of us from realizing that the
human relationship with other ani-
mals is based on power. We are
stronger than they are. We do what-
ever we want, whenever we want,
because non-human animals are
unable to stop us. In the sameway in
which people holding power deny
the rights of people with less power,
human animals deny the rights of
non-human animals.

Animals are in laboratories
because we are powerful enough to
keep them there, not because it is
where they belong. Once they are
restrained and caged, we can burn,
irradiate, infect, electrocute, poison
and “sacrifice” them. The extent of
experimentation is limited by imagi-
nation, not law.

Animals are on our dinner tables
because we are powerful enough to
control their lives from birth. We
confine them in the smallest possible
spaces, breed or artificially insemi-
nate them, take their babies away,
give them hormones, overfeed them
and, finally, kill them. Animal skins,
with and without their fur, are on
our bodies because we are powerful
enough to hunt, trap, club, shoot and
harpoon other animals. We maintain
wilderness habitats for fur-bearing
animals in order to harvest them. We
control the natural predator popula-
tion to “conserve” the stock.

NTMALS are the victims of a

vast human-regulated system

of slavery. They serve our
desires and whims, whether for the
taste of their flesh, the feel of their
skin or the profit that can be made.
To see this enslavement for what it
is, and to comprehend the suffering
that it causes, is the first step toward
understanding the meaning of ani-
mals’ rights -— that is, the rights that
are possessed by human and non-hu-
man animals alike. The next step is
to respond to the call that this places
on our conscience and do something
to restore the rights that naturally
belong to what Henry Beston called
“other nations,” in a disturbing and
beautiful passage in his book “The
Outermost House.”

boards of the Fund for Animals and Mercy
Crusade, both national animal-rights
organizations.

“It’s pretty simple, really,” said
.Mayor Mark Ingebrigtson, 37, in-
explaining the town’s fundamental
“economics. “We get 10,000
fftouri‘sts a year. We ﬁgge they
spend, at minimum, $1, .

. apiece

while they’re here. That’s a third of
everything we make.”

But the bears have been getting
harder to ﬁnd since wildlife ofﬁcers
ordered the-town’s open dump
cleaned up two years ago. The
dump had long been a tempting
dining spot for the bears and thus a
prime, but dangerous, tourist attrac-
tron.

Moreovér, the wildlife. ofﬁcers,
concerned about increasing bear-
human contact, are aggressrvely
tranquilizing and caging “problem ’
bears that wander near the town,
either holding them until the ice
forms or ﬂying them by helicopter
far up the bay. The bears, as a con-
sequence, are dispersing. And some
tour operators, having charged cus-

tomers more than $100 a day to
see beans, are responding by illegally
leaving out food.

“I don’t just bait the bears—I
feed the bears,” Dan Guiavich, a
prominent photographer of the
bears, said without apology.

“I make no secret of it,” ex-
plained Guravich, who has operated
a tourist camp on the tundra for
several years. “People come here
expecting to see bears. If you don’t
feed them, there won’t .be’ many
bears to see.”

Guravich contends he is helping
starving bears survive, and that by
feeding them on the tundra he is
discouraging them from roaming
into town. But wildlife ofﬁcers, who
have killed several dozen threaten-
ing bears in recent years, decry such
feeding.

“They are actually endangering
the bears,” said ofﬁcer Rick Tease.
“Once a bear’s been baited, it

 

 

 

 

 

comes to associate humans with
food. Then it could end up en-
dlangen‘ng a person and have to be

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - NOV. 10, 1987

SPCA Won't Enforce
'Vicious' Dog Law Yet

By Dawn Garcia

San Francisco’s animal con-
trol agency is refusing to en-
force a new local law that al-
lows the city to seize dogs con-
sidered “vicious and danger-
ous.”

Under the law. which took ef-
fect yesterday, the city has the right
to immediately impound dogs be-
lieved to be a threat to the public,
with a subsequent hearing and pen-
alties as high as $1,000 or a year in
jail for the dog‘s owner,

Before the law was enacted,
“the dog had to bite somebody for
there to be anything done,” said
Supervisor Jim Gonzales, author of
the measure.

Richard Avanzino, president of
the San Francisco Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
said his agency must be assured the
city will cover the costs of this law
—- and clear up a longstanding prob-
lem with a vicious pit bull languish-
ing in the pound — before the SPCA
will take on the new responsibilities
called for in the law.

“They (the city) say they don’t
have money to pay us for what
we‘re doing already and at the same
time they’re increasing our costs
and workload,” Avanzino said.

City official Fred Weiner said
the SPCA’s contract may change in
light of the new law, but. he warned
that the city is in “a budget crisis of
sorts.”

If the SPCA continues to refuse
to enforce the new law. police offi-
cers or other city employees may
have to do the Job, Weiner said.

Avanzino said that just to house
100 vicious dogs awaiting hearings
under the new law could cost the
SPCA $100,000 more than the $1.5
million it receives annually from
the city for animal control.

The agency also worries that

with SPCA animal control officers

who walk onto private property to
seize potentially vicious dogs could
face costly lawsuits. The SPCA is
asking the city to provide legal pro-
tections for its employees.

Meanwhile, the SPCA wants
the city also to decide the case of
Heebee. an American pit bullterri-
er, who was impounded on Dec. 15.
1986 and has been at the SPCA ever
since.

After Heebee killed another
dog and viciously attacked a woman
passer-by with more than 20 bites.
he was sentenced to death, but the
case is being appealed with no reso-
lution in sight.

 




CHICAGO TRIBUNE - November 8, 198."

Feed this town’s kitty, but no

By Howard Witt
Chicago Tribune

CHURCHILL, Manitoba—Out
on the barren Arctic tundra on
this brittle, late fall afternoon, half
a dozen polar bears are cavorting
to the rhythm of camera shutters
clicking furiously.

The scores of tourists snapping
the pictures from the safety of
special buses—and paying about
$2,000 for the chance—are simply
ecstatic.

Twenty miles to the west, mean—
while, where the small town of
Churchill clings to frigid Hudson
Bay, the local merchants are tot—
ting up the day’s tourist receipts.
They are ecstatic as well.

But something is wrong with the
picture. The nomadic bears so
conveniently gathered before the
tourists” cameras are there only
because one tour promoter has
been surreptitiously—and illegal-
ly—feeding them.

As a result the happy merchants,
like everyone else among the
town’s 1,200 residents, walk the
night streets at their peril. The
huge white carnivores, grown ac-
customed to human feeding out
on the tundra, sometimes wander
into Churchill’s back alleys,
looking for more of the same.
Twice in the last 20 years, polar

bears have killed town residents.

And the fragile tundra itself,
sustaining the bears, the tourism
and thus a healthy chunk of the
local economy, is slowly being
torn up under the huge tires of
“tundra buggies,” the modified
school buses that are proliferating
to serve the booming tourist de-
mand to get close to the bears.

Welcome to Churchill, Mani—
toba, the self—described “Polar
Bear Capital of the World,” a
town famous for the hundreds of
bears that gather nearby each fall
to await the freezeup of Hudson
Bay. And welcome to a classic wil-
derness dilemma.

“Things have kind of changed
here in the last seven years,”
mused Len Smith, owner of Tun-
dra Buggy Tours and the inventor
in 1980 of the elevated vehicle,
which can navigate the rocky,
marshy terrain. He now runs seven
of them, while another four are
operated by two competing tour
companies.

“Before, you had a private, per-
sonal feel to the tours,” Smith
continued. “Now, with 11 buggies
out there, we‘re almost running
over each other.”

“It”is kind of like a circus out
here, echoed Mike Lacey, a pro—
fessronal photographer from Aus-

tin, Tex., who guides polar bear
photo tours each fall. “The people
'in Churchill see the number of
buggies increasing, the tourists in-
creasing, the hotels increasing, but
the bears are not increasing.
Something will have to be done.”

There are other Arctic locales——
in Norway, the Soviet Union and
Alaska—where an intrepid traveler
can see some of the estimated
20,000 polar bears thought to exist
in the world.

But Canada is host to fully half
the population of the massive
beasts—at 1,600 pounds, the larg—
est males are twice the size of
tilgers and half again as big as griz-
2 ms.

And Churchill, 600 miles south
of the Arctic Circle on the
southwestern shore of Hudson
Bay, is the summer home of an

estimated 1,200 bears—one for ' 1

every town resident. Fifty miles
south of town is the largest known
polar bear denning area in the
world.

The bears like the Churchill area
because the northern forest ends

here, the arctic tundra begins and,

not least, because the fresh water
at the mouth of the Churchill
River is the ﬁrst on the ocean bay
to freeze up—in late October or
early November.

This affords the bears an}. early}...

start on their winter journey onto
the ice, ﬂoes, where they indulge in
their favorite passion, hunting
seals.

Man, too, has intermittently
found the rocky, wind-blasted bit
of coast a fit place to settle: The
Inuit stayed here in prehistory,
European explorers in the early
17th Century and the Hudson’s
Bay Co. a hundred years after
that. .

The railroad reached thearea 1n
the 19305, to supply a grain. port;
outside of costly air travel, it still
represents the only route out of
town. .

But the recent history .of Chur
chill is told in the rusting ships
dotting the coastline, the aban—
doned navy base, the unprofitable
port operation that seems peren-
nially in danger of shutting down.
The tundra, with its polar bears in
the fall and variety of rare birds in
the summer, represents the last of
Churchill’s natural resources left
to exploit.

Madison, Wis. - Owners of race- '
horses require their thoroughbreds to
race too young. too hard and too
often, according to the chief investi-
gator for the Humane Society of the
United States.

And making matters worse, the
owners inject drugs into horses to
mask their pain, the investigator,
Robert Baker, said Tuesday in an
interview before a. legislative hearing
on treatment of racing animals.

Baker asked the Wisconsin Legis-
lature to enact what would be the
most far-reaching animal protection
law of any state in which racing is
legal. The legislation he propom
would ban drugging of horses and
would require a veterinary examina-

' tion of each racehorse before post
time. Any lame horse would be
scratched.

In April, Wisconsin voters ratified
a constitutional amendment allowing
betting on pari-mutuel races, along
with an amendment allowing a state
lottery. The Legislature is expected
to enact laws authorizing and regu-
lating pari-mutuel betting and the
lottery this fall.

Baker testified Tuesday at a hear-
ing of the Assembly State Affairs
Committee.

Although racing of 2-year-old .
horses is a major cause of injury,
Baker said, the Humane Society’s
proposed legislation would not ban
racing at that age. The practice
already is firmly established in horse
racing, as owners try to recoup their
investment in horses as early as they
can, Baker said.

The bones of horses are not strong
enough at that age to withstand the
pounding of the track, Baker said.
Worse, a horse called a “2-year-old:

isn’t necessarily 24 months old, he
said. For racing purposes, the birth
date of thoroughbreds is recorded a
Jan. 1 of the year of birth; a horse
born in June is considered a 2-year-
old only 18 months after birth.

“Racing 2-year-olds would be like
putting a 12-year-old boy in a p
football game, Baker said. -

The legislation proposed by Baker
would allow imprisonment for up to
five years and a fine of up to $25,000
for anyone convicted of racing" a
drugged horse. Violators also would.
be banned from participating in
horse racing for up to 10 years.

wild animals,” says Wright,
“you just don’t have the genes
to expect normal petlike behav-
ior. The animal could be OK
with one person, but not be
able to handle any sort of novel
situation. It goes into the ﬁght—
or-flight response.”

“Pets are good for people,
with the unfettered love they
give,” says Garrett. “But dogs
and cats serve that purpose, and
they serve it well. There is no
need to bring in, these wild an-
imals. ” ——Erika Archibald

“A tortoise that’s used to a
,family dog, isn’t going to get too
excited if a coyote comes snifﬁng
around,” Schwalbe said.

Cecil Schwalbe, a herpetologist
for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department’s non-game branch,
compares the tortoise with other,
more popular pets.

"They’re more like a cat in that
they’re independent,” Schwalbe
said. “I call them the ‘Bambi’ of
the reptile world in that they elicit
empathy and emotions from peo—
ple not normally shown other
reptiles.

"They’ll beg for food, scratch on

With a hunting license, have been
able to pick up a desert tortoise
and take it home. That’s all
changed now. As of Jan. 1, posses-
smn continues to be legal, but
taking one from the desert will not
be allowed.

"There has been some concern

over the last several years that the
tortmse population is declining,”
Schwalbe said. “It is difficult to
document that because we don’t
have data from 20 or 30 years ago
for comparison.
. "We don’t feel that collecting by
individuals is the sole reason the
tortmse may be in trouble, but it is
a factor we can control.”

It Will be easy for people who

Schwalbe said. “They can receive

matter, may be given to another

Edepartment.” 7

Schwalbe is adamant that tor-

.itoises not be released back into the

wild.

“Picking them up and dropping j
them in the desert just doesn’t ., --

work,” Schwalbe said. "Even adult»
turtles are susceptible to diseases, '

and they have little chance of

surviving.

"New information we’ve re---
ceived also suggests that tortoises - ,.
from different ranges are unique.
For example, a Mohave desert
tortoise isn’t the same as one“.
found in another area.” ~

Newly released tortoises ar

more likely to become victims of . ,

predators. According to Schwalbe,
coyotes, ringtail cats and other

predators regularly prey on tor- .
toises from hatchling size up to .

several years old. He added that

there are tens of thousands in
possession in the state. California
has 27,000 registered in possession,
and they think that’s about half of
the number actually being kept.”
Schwalbe believes the action

taken by the department and

i ert tortoise from being listed as

Wildlife Service. Often, research.

i animal that is listed as endan- .

In addition, several groups have
been lobbying for total tortoise
protection. These include some
who are using the tortoise as a
means to rid public lands of .
grazing cattle. ,

"We’re not in a push to find out
who’s got a tortoise and who
doesn’t,” Schwalbe said. "We’re
attempting to let peeple know
what the regulations are in an
attempt to take the pressure off :
the tortoise in the wild.” '

Take a Bowwow, Bowser!

 

Movies and television are fast heading for the dogs

ho is ABC-TV’s most tem-

peramental femme fatale?
What movie star can most quickly
bring a lump to your throat?
Whose acting skills can make you
gasp in admiration? Who is the
fanciest dude on the screen today?
Enough. The questions are too
easy. and you already know that
the answers are not Cybill Shep—
herd. William Hurt. Robert De
Niro and Eddie Murphy.

They of course are:

Bijoux, 2, the snappy (as in
“Ouch!” and “Will you stop it!”)
brown-and-white Jack Russell
terrier who stars with John Ritter
in the hit series Hooperman.

Benji, 12, the adorable long—
haired mutt whose latest ﬂick,

Benji the Hunted, made $22 mil- ’7
lion last summer.

Mike, 9, the black-and-white
border collie who upstaged the hitherto
un-upstageable Bette Midler in last year’s
Down and Out in Beverly Hills and who is
busy making commercials and consider-
ing ﬁlm projects.

Spuds MacKenzie, 3, the (mostly) white
bullterrier who has gained a cult following
as television spokespooch for Bud Light
beer. Spuds’ promoters say he is the “Aya-
tola Partyola, the Guru of Good Times,
the Philosopher of Fun.”

Hollywood has had dog years before.
True, Rin Tin Tin kept Warner Bros.
from going broke in the ’20s, and Lassie
was one of MGM’s biggest money earners
in the ’40s. But now, it seems, nearly every
movie, TV series or commercial has an-
other of man’s best friends wagging and
barking away. Among the other rising
dog stars of 1987 are Grendel, the yuppie
puppy on ABC’s family drama thirty—

Here’s loo

 

king at you, kid! Bi' checks herself out

something, and Bo, the German shep—
herd—husky half-breed of Summer School.

The canines keep coming. In various
stages of gestation for 1988, or Year of
the Dog 11: K—9 (a movie about a cop
and his you-know-what partner), The
Dog Who Cried Wolf (a ﬁlm comedy
about. yes, a talking dog), The Adven-
tures of Milo and Otis (a Japanese im-
port about a canine and his cat friend)
and Cold Dog Soup (a black comedy
about a dead dog).

Why so much doggery? Kitty Brown,
editor of Animal Entertainment, a New
York City trade publication, thinks the
answer has a lot to do with the mood of
the late ’805. “Times are tough,” she says,
“and we need a little innocence, some-
thing that hearkens back to childhood.”
Others might say that Hollywood heark-
ens to money: if one dog movie cashes in,

ten imitations sprout up within a year.

But personality, talent and hard work
all helped bring the latest crop of dog
talent to the fore. Bijoux, for instance.
“looks as if they built her from spare
parts.” says Hooperman ’s execu-
tive producer. Rick Kellard. He
adds. “This sounds kind of sur—
realistic. but the dog can do al-
most everything.”

Versatile as she is, Bijoux
has a personality as distinct and
as difﬁcult as Tallulah Bank-
head’s. Charm is decidedly not
her main attraction. She has been
aﬂiicted with ﬂatulence. for ex-
ample. which bothers everybody
but her, and when she nips at
Ritter’s hand. she is not necessar-
ily acting.

Benji is also. well, a bitch.
Says Writer-Director Joe Camp:
“Benji started her ﬁrst movie
when she was eleven months old.
She had a whole movie on her
back when most dogs are playing
with puppy toys." Making Mike
a star was tougher. Says Trainer
Clint Rowe: “It took a year of just
spending time with him before he got over
his shyness.”

The dog that makes no bones about his
star status is Beerbarker Spuds. whose
muzzle appears on some 200 items. includ-
ing T shirts, coﬂ'ee mugs and posters. He
has already ﬁlmed ten Bud Light commer-
cials and has another upcoming. On
Dec. 8 he or she—some claim that Spuds is
actually a female whose real name is
Evie-will be a guest veejay on MTV and
early next year will appear in a supporting
role in Robert Downey‘s new movie Rent-
ed Lips. “He wasn’t playing Hamlet. but
Spuds was perfect on the ﬁrst take every
time,” says Film Producer Mort Engelberg.
“He didn’t ask for overtime, and there was
no sexual misconduct on the set.” Holly-
wood, in short, seems at last to be barking
up the right tree. -——By Gerald Clarke.

.~ .“We had other, older studies
that showed both of them (individu-
ally) in other products being used
in. higher concentrations on ani-
mals,” Hutton says. “Now we can
honestly say that we wish we would
have, looked at them first,” he says.

_ In light of the mounting contro-
versy, Hartz issued a statement not-
ing-its cooperation with the EPA yet
defending Blockade as “the most ef-
fective product in repelling fleas
and ticks,” said William Perlberg,
Hartz vice president of research.

. “The use of any product to con-
trol fleas on pets is associated with
a degree of hazard to the animal,”
Perlberg’s statement reads.

~ The company representative re-
fused to answer any questions, re-
ferringrall inquiries to the prepared

statement.

“InSecticides in the pyrethrins
category which include Blockade
have been reputed to be among the
safest available,” the statement con-
tinued -

Nevertheless, pet owners who
have called the poison agencies re-
port alarming physical symptoms in
animals treated with Blockade ——
symptoms such as heavy salivation,
vomiting, muscle tremors and ex-
treme-changes in behavior.

University toxicologist Sundlof
says damage to the central nervous
system is the most profound result
ofcpyrethrin poisoning. Tampa vet-
erinarian Hughes, meanwhile, says
chronic liver failure is common in
serious poisoning cases.

The greatest degree of toxicity
has been recorded in young, female
cats and in dogs more than one year
old, according to statistics compiled
by the Illinois Animal Poison Infor-
matiOn ‘Center, the largest facility of
its kind in the United States.

, According to EPA’s Hutton,
Hartz has countered the myriad ac-
cusations by referring to the retail
success of the product —— more than

Hutton says Hartz believes the
problems are “coincidental” to the
use ,of. the product; that is, the ani-
mals were already sick before the
insecticide was applied.

' Moreover, Hutton says that the
problems could be cautdnbyﬁaon-
sumers who put too mac}; Blockade

to “I totally disagree with that,”
Sundlof says. “Products that are
sold over the counter should have a
margin of safety that is adequate to
protect from overdose.

“And it’s human nature to over-
use this kind of thing. We think if a
little is good, a lot is better,” he
says.

Adds Hughes, the Tampa veteri-
narian: “You have such strong prod-
uct recognition (with Hartz) that I
feel there is a strong inclination for
many people to automatically trust
the product. With that comes a re-
sponsibility."

Fighting fleas is a continual
challenge, particularly in Florida,
Where hot, humid conditions are a
perfect environment for harboring
the insects. -

“Fleas come equipped to cope

with about everything that man can ‘

dish out,” says Dr. Joe Gloyd, assis-
tant director of scientific activities
for the American Veterinary Medi-
cal Association. .
Interestingly, the effectiveness
of Blockade has not been well-docu-

-: .mented by the EPA, Hutton says.

“Our greatest concern is with

i the safety of the product,” he says.

Sundlof explains that rigorous
testing on products such as Block-
ade is not a primary function of the
EP[:The agency was set up to test
environmental problems,” Sundlof
says. “They have little expertise in
food and drugs.

“I don’t consider it to be any-
body’s fault,” Sundlof adds. “It’s Just
something that fell through the ad-
ministrative cracks.”

To Mitten, these cracks were
nearly wide enough to make her

 

dog disappear, she says. Heidi was
operated on for extenswe liver
‘ damage Oct. 20 and the recovery
has been emotional and arduous.
“I’m happy that she’s at home
now,” Mitten says. “I just wish Heidi
could talk.”

here and you can’t throw a foreign
species back into the water here
without harming it.’ "

McGilvray, a' graduate of
Northeastern University who
moved to Alaska from Quincy five
years ago, was persuaded. He said
yesterday that he had bought
Mike for a festive dinner for his
fellow workers. “We don’t have
lobster in Alaska and what’ we get
is imported," McGilvray said.

Macris, who spends his sum-
mers in Saco, Maine, said that
Mike was probably picked up by a
Boston fishing boat and that he
was flown by a Boston fish dis~
tributor to an Anchorage distribu-
tor.

With lobster selling in Alaska
for $11.99 a pound, Mike cost
McGilvray a cool $270.

But, he‘ said, he was ”over-
whelmed” by Macris' “steadfast-
ness. that he wanted to buy the

lobster's life. I told him just to take

it... ,

“This happens once in a life-
time. and even though he insisted
on compensating me for the lob-

step, I don’t want it. I think he 5

gave a lot of his time and money
in returning Mike to New England
and I salute him for it." McGilvray
said.

He bought other, smaller lob—
sters for dinner.

ln Wasilla, about 25 miles from
Anchorage, The Frontiersman
ran a contest to name the lobster.
The winner apparently combined
the first name of Carr's fish de-
partment manager with the lob-
ster's size and came up with
“Monster Mike.”

. Hordes of Alaskans, in the.

midst of the first blizzard of the
scason. put on their mukluks and
trudged to Carr’s to admire Mike.

In preparation for Mike's trip

 

back home, Macris had the mar—
ket gradually lower the water tem-
perature in the lobster's tank to
slow down his metabolism for the
long haul.

For two weeks, while Macris
made arrangements to ship him to
New England. Mike basked in the
limelight. He kept up his strength
by consuming a quarter—pound of
scallops a day.

Macris, a certified diver since
he was 13, said he had never seen
a crustacean the size of Mike. He
estimated after consulting Alas-
kan fish and game officials that
Mike is as old as 90.

It cost Macris $171 to ship
Mike to Maine. priority freight on
United Airlines. A pittance, con-
sidering the stakes. Macris said.

On Monday, Macris drove the
short distance from his home in
Palmer to Wasilla to fetch the
crated lobster. "It was our first ice
storm. Cars were littered over the
highway," he said. Sixty miles lat-
er through the snowstorm. Macris
was at the Anchorage airport.

Somehow, Mike missed his

eastbound connection in Chicago.
He was put on the next plane and
arrived Tuesday at Portland Inter—
national Jetport 24 hours after
leaving Alaska.

Tuesday night, Dolliver said,
Mike was allowed to rest up at
Harbor Fish Market in Portland,
where more crowds gathered to
gawk at him.

Yesterday morning around 9.

. ,uAM-ﬁwm: ~ ' rm» ““M«‘h*mva&h‘v- ”~92“ .: . tum-.ww I

more crowds gathered to see Mike
off in a Marine Patrol Boat. Out to
Portland Head Light, off Cape Eliz—
abeth, the boat went. Mike was
lowered gently over the side. He
was home, at last.

And safe. Maine is the only
state in the country that protects
both undersize and oversize lob—
sters as a way of maintaining
breeding stock.

11 its 16year history, Greenpeace mem-

bers have chained themselves to har-

poon guns, hiked into nucleanweapon
test sites, blocked the ocean dumping of
radioactive wastes and parachuted off pol-
luting smokestacks. Their image was that of
a ragtag bunch of Earth Day peaceniks per-
forming unorthodox ecological stunts. But
that image is changing. .

Greenpeace USA (a division of Green-
peace lnternationall has become the nation’s
fastest-growing environmental group, with
more than 700,000 members in the United
States. It has grown at a rate of 35 percent to
40 percent a year since 1976. Among envi-
ronmental organizations, it is second in size
only to the National Wildlife Federation.
This year’s budget for Greenpeace USA will
be about $7 million.

Around the world, Greenpeace mem-
bership is approaching 2 million, with of-
fices in 17 countries, and the group is explor-
ing the possibility of expanding into the
Soviet Union.

“The public response to putting our
lives on the line and taking risks for causes
has been fantastic,“ said David Chatfield,
regional Greenpeace director in San Fran-
cisco. "Our tactic is to create visibility for
issues. to make the public aware of what is
going on through direct action.”

This is what Greenpeace members have
done in the Bay Area in the last 192 years:

 

Bill Soiffer is a Chronicle reporter on leave as a
journalism fellow at the Harvard University
School of Public Health.

I They tried to stop the Navy from upgrad-
ing its nuclear arsenal in the Bay Area by
blocking the USS. Texas, a nuclear misSile
cruiser, with rubber boats as it sailed into
Alameda Channel. One member in a wetsuit
clung to bow of the giant ship and forced ll
to slow down.

IThew distributed leaflets that charged
Norway with allowing pirate whaling in vio-
lation ”of international law. The leaflets

 




urged a telephone call-in protest that, ac-
cording to Greenpeace, inundated the
phone system of the Norwegian Consulate
in San Francisco and the Norwegian Embas
sy in Washington. The consulate, however,

insists the protest in San Francisco never
happened.

lThey hiked into a nuclear test site in the
Nevada desert in the middle of the night,

forcing the Department of Energy to delay
detonation of an underground atomic bomb.

The f und-raising success of Greenpeace
in the Bay Area is staggering. Each week,
7,500 residents open their doors to Green-
peace can vassers. One of every four makes a
donation. The regional office at Fort Mason
in San Francisco expects to raise $600,000
this year, more than any of the group‘s 20
other offices in the United States.

“At some point, the New York Times
stopped referring to us as a radical environ—
mental organization and began calling us a
prominent conservation organization,”
Greenpeace executive director Steve Saw-
yer said in a telephone interview from the
group‘s Washington headquarters. “We real-
ly flip-flop between the two. We do good
deeds lobbying from our executive suites in

Washington, and sometimes we are a band
of crazies sailing off into David vs, Goliath
confrontations."

[ reenpeace formed in 1971 in Vancou-
ver, Canada, when a small amateur

navy of anti-nuclear protesters set
sail in a barely seaworthy fishing boat to
protest US. nuclear weapons testing on Am-
chitka Island in Alaska. Partly as a result of
the publicity created by Greenpeace, the
tests were halted and Amchitka is now a
bird sanctuary.

The organization‘s main strength.
which makes it unique in the environmental
movement, is the scale of its operations.
ranging from grass roots to international
levels. Greenpeace International has led the
fights that resulted in worldwide bans on
whaling and dumping nuclear wastes at sea.
Its current agenda covers even broader ar-
eas: nuclear disarmament; preservation of
endangered wildlife and preservation of the
world's last wilderness, Antarctica, which is
threatened by mineral and oil exploitation;
and ending production of toxic wastes.

In the Bay Area, where Greenpeace has
a full-time staff of 12, it has launched cam-
paigns to ban toxic-waste incinerators, halt
the growth of the Navy’s nuclear armada in
“ the bay and stop offshore oil drilling.

; According to the Greenpeace philosa

phy, protesters adopt the Quaker principle
of "bearing witness" or accepting responsi-
bility for “injustices" and taking direct, non-
violent action to prevent them. A key tactic
of the organization is a flair for creating
puhhcny.

"Greenpeace is not about stunt people
performing for cameras.“ said Kate Karam.

the group‘s regional media coordinator. “Di-

rect action is a double-edged sword It
works, but the press looks only as far as the

sensational aspects. It is difficult to get seri-
ous issues into the media."

Chatfield added “We use '

. , powerful im-
ages to inform the public that such events as
the French domg nuclear-weapons testing

in the South Pacific are ha en'
a I
are there to stop it.” pp ing nd we

. The advent of sophisticated co 1
cationsenabled Greenpeace to immemdrigtlelly
transmit Video pictures of the French nucle-
ar testing to news organizations via satellite
Chatfield believes the TV'images are what
prompted the French government to blow

up the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in
the New Zealand port of Auckland in 1985.

The act of sabotage, which the French
admitted, killed one Greenpeace crew mem-
ber and won Greenpeace enormously sym-
pathetic publicity. Greenpeace recently an-
nounced that an arbitration tribunal in Ge
neva has ordered France to pay damages of
$.16 million to the organization for sinking
the ship.

In retrospect, Sawyer believes the
Rainbow Warrior bombing hurt Green-
peace more than it helped. “We were on the
world stage primarily in a defensive pos-
ture," he said. Sawyer, who was a Rainbow
Warrior crew member and whose birthday
celebration on the ship had just ended when
the bomb exploded, said people who meet
Greenpeace canvassers frequently are con-
fused and mistakenly believe Greenpeace
bombed a French ship.

reenpeace’s tactics and philosophy
are not popular with many others in
the environmental movement.

Jay Hair, president of the National

Wildlife Federation, believes Greenpeace
antics serve no value in changing public

policy. “No one, including Greenpeaceha: .

 

the right to break laws or deny the rights of
others to accomplish their individual goals,"
Hair said in a telephone interview.

Sierra Club Chairman Michael McClos-
key no longer classifies Greenpeace in the
antiestablishment category. “They had a
rather disorganized approach but now are
moving into more conventional lobbying
and enjoy tremendous name recognition”.
he said.

One of Greenpeace‘s strangest new
stances is as a defense contractor. In an
unusual marriage of frequent adversaries,
Greenpeace holds US. Army Corps of Engi-
neers contracts to patrol beaches near a
Jacksonville, Fla, Trident project site, keep-

The Arctic coastal plain and humanity’s de bt to nature '

 

By Heather Fern

 

NO’I‘HER section of rare wilderness is before

Congress to be opened up for oil and gas develop—

ment: the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska. Established in 1960 as the 9 million-acre Arctic
Range, this refuge was expanded in 1980 to a total of 19
million acres, with 8 million acres set aside as permanent
wilderness. But the 125—mile coastline of the refuge (1.5
million acres of coastal plain) was left unprotected be-
cause of oil potential. This coastal plain is referred to as
the 1002 area.

It is important to realize that 90 percent of Alaska’s
North Slope is already open to oil and gas development.
The 1002 area is the last 125 miles of untouched coast-
line. And this last stretch of wild coastal plain is a critical
area for the entire Arctic Refuge, because thousands of
animals and millions of birds use this spot for calving,
staging, nesting, and feeding. The 1002 area cannot be
treated as a separate entity. Disturb this coastal plain,
and the wildlife throughout the refuge could be in
jeopardy.

Despite the inevitable destruction of the refuge’s wil-
' derness, opening up the coastal plain for oil development
simply represents captivity - the feeling of no escape
from the plundering of mankind. No silence, no rever-
ence. And what confusion must the animals experience?
Invaded once more, they will be forced to ﬁnd some
where else to breed, give birth, feed, and survive. Only
this time there is no place else to go.

The cooperation needed for any species to survive in
the severe climate of the Arctic is extraordinary. The
snows are absent for only 2% to 3 months a year, and
year round the ground stays permanently frozen 2 to 3
feet below the surface.

Even so, the abundance of wildlife is amazing. Ani-
mals such as caribou, moose, white Arctic foxes, wolver-
ines, prehistoric musk oxen, brown bears, grizzlies, Dall
sheep, wolves, and polar bears all depend on the Arctic
refuge in its untouched condition. At various times dur-
ing the year the 1002 area is also used by golden eagles,
Arctic terns, loons, and millions of migrating ducks,
geese, and swans (135 species in all).

:HVLS ‘ SEHSHH W01

The Interior Department has estimated a 19 percent
chance, at best, that the 1002 area could supply the
United States with 3.5 billion barrels of oil -— only a few
months’ worth, hardly a guarantee to our national
security.

In the 19405 Joseph Kinsey Howard, in his book
“Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome,” said that in the
West “there has been no continuity, no sense of debt to
the land.” Howard said the American Indians recognized
this quickly and “learned that the more a white man
sees, the more he seizes - and that what the white man
takes he uses brieﬂy and wantonly and casts aside.” Is
this to be the fate of the coastal plain? If so, it appears
that we have learned nothing from our mistakes.

The separation from, and ignorance of, the natural
world around us is most disturbing, as if it had nothing to
do with our very existence. We seem to be losing sight of
the fact that nature provides more than the resources
needed for survival and comfort. “This fragile earth, our
island home,” is also a stage for seeking wisdom, a place
for spiritual growth.

The 1002 area needs to be set aside as wilderness.
Couldn’t we set aside the 1002 area as an offering of
thanksgiving to our creator? We are so indebted to the
land and to the wildlife it contains. It is time we adopted
a “reverent partnership with nature,” and began living
in “honorable alliance” with it, as our native Americans
did so long ago. It’s not too late.

Vandal called 'ohicken against meat’ serves
up food fOr thought in anti-carnivore graffiti

 

By Donna Lorenz Shealy
Staff Writer

 

An elusive vegetarian has left a ’

paint trail of graffiti across the North-
side, alerting meat eaters to the possi-
bility of cancer.

A vandal dubbed “the chicken
against meat" by police has spray-
painted anti-carnivore slogans on signs
and walls from the wooded suburbs
west of Sandy Springs to DeKalb
County highways and, reportedly, into
Gwinnett County. The graffiti say
“Meat = Cancer” or “Every Fur
Hurts,” or otherwise decry in vivid
language the use of meat or animal
skins.

Sgt. John Davis of the Fulton
County Police said he has seen the
graffiti, but that no complaints have
come into the North Fulton Precinct.

“I‘ve seen it and I’m scratching

my head,” Davis said. “I can’t figure-

what the heck they’re talking about,

and

unless it’s somebody who’s against eat-
ing meat, some vegetarian nut
faction.”

Fulton County traffic engineer
Marwan Abboud said he is not aware
of the department replacing any de-
faced signs or receiving any com-
plaints. “There’s something going on,
but I can’t trace them,” Abboud said.

Police and traffic departments in
Gwinnett, DeKalb and Cobb counties
report no complaints of signs or prop-
erty defaced by the graffiti.

Linda Gillman, director of the
Sandy Springs Chamber of Commerce,
reported seeing the signs “all over this
town.”

“Isn’t this the weirdest thing? It
must be sOmebody who’s a vegetarian
an environmentalist, obvious-
ly,” said Mrs. Gillman. “But the way
they’re making their point isn’t too
swift.”

An attack on fast food twice has

 

 

 

 

been painted on the Aside of a vacant

Sandy Springs gas station, according
to the building's owner, Ray Boyd.

Boyd said previous, owners painted out.

graffitii he remembered as “McDeath,
Dead (somethinglon a Bun,” Boyd
said. A month ago, the slogan was
back and he had it painted over again,
he said.“ , ‘ ‘

Mrs. Gillman said she saw the cru-
sading herbivore’s work on Boyd’s
building and. remembers that it said-
“Dead Flesh on a Bun.”_

“It made my skin crawl,” she said.

“Meat = Cancer” is sprayed in big.

black letters on a retaining wall at
Peachtree—Dunwoody Road and I-285

. in DeKalb County-

“Eat Meat, Get Cancer” is painted
on signs near at least two intersec-

tions on} Riverside Drive, said Republi-v
can state Sen. Sallie Newbill, who '

lives in the area.

Did you know that the Post Office

has actually employed cats since 1868? They’re

 

 

 

 

 

 

OST people don't realise that cats
have been on the official payroll
of the Post Office for more than a
century.

They're not employed to sort or deliver
mail. of course. but to protect the letters. They
are the mouse hunters who make sure that
your morning post arrives nibble-free!

These loyal public servants appear on the
official payroll as "Rodent Operative." But
most of us would more easily recognise them
under the title of "Post Office Cat."

They work unsocial hours while we sleep.
hardly ever get a Christmas bonus in their
pay packets. and can't bargain for better
conditions.

The vast majority of them are alley cats.
and the average rate of pay is no more than
a few pounds a month -— just enough to pay
for their food. But there is one added
incentive to their job. They are allowed to
eat all the mice that they can catch!

The whole idea of the Post Office
employing cats to control the rodent
pgpulation goes back to the days prior to"

97. "

As a part of the Jubilee celebrations of
Queen Victoria, it was decided that there
would be a house-to—house delivery of letters
by postrnen. (Prior to this date, the public had
to queue inside post offices for their mail.) As
a result, there was a huge accumulation of
letters and parcels at post offices. Vast
numbers of rats and mice began to hide
amongst the mail and cause considerable
damage as they nibbled at letters and

els.

In 1868. the Post Office authorities decided
to employ cats to keep the rodent population
under control. It was suggested that they
should be paid one and a half old pence a
day, or two shillings per week.

A CM” 5 WEEKLY WAGE!

THOSE cats that were employed had to
be females. because it was thought
that they were better and more

persistent hunters than the males. If the

number of mice in a post office did not
decline greatly after six months. then these
cats were to be dismissed from their place
of work.

London post offices were the first to try out
the experiment. Within a few months the
rodent population had shrunk dramatically.
Other post offices all over the country were
soon using cats in the war against rats and
mice.

Soon. the pay of the cats was to improve.
too. Within ten years some cats were paid
the allowance of six or nine pence a day.

asked by some Members of Parliament when
it was that cats last had a raise in wages. It
was then pointed out to him that they had not
had a salary increase since 1873.

The Assistant Postmaster replied that he
found it impossible "to organise any scheme
for payment by results or output bonus."
Furthermore, he divulged that no cats were
ever employed in post offices in Northern
Ireland. and that postmasters were
authorised to increase the cat allowance as
"a maternity grant" if the cats had kittens on
the premisesl

F our years later. postrnasters were
instructed to increase payment to cats.
because of the substantial rise in prices. At
that time. a tin of cat food cost nine pence.
and a pint of milk was seven and a half
pence. It was generally felt that these
essential foods had to be provided for every
cat in Britain's post offices.

Some of these hard-working cats have
become quite famous. Perhaps the most
distinguished of all of them was a cat called
Lucky. In 1980, he foiled an attempted
robbery in a Worcestershire post office ——
and he did so all on his own.

As the two burglars made their way in
through the window, Lucky ﬂew at them. He
sank his claws into the back of one of the
men and into the neck of the other.

This surprise attack was too much for the
men and they ﬂed empty-handed.

For this heroic behaviour, Lucky was
awarded the first~ever Post Office DFC
(Distinguished Feline Conduct) certificate. He
went on to win great acclaim in the
newspapers of the countryl

mice caught.

Some Post Office officials objected to such
a princely sum being pdd to mere cats.

They pointed out that the cats employed
were often unreliable and capricious in their
duties. They were even prone to prolonged
absenteeism when they strayed from the very
offices they were supposed to protect.

In 1952, the scandal of cat pay was raised
in Question Time at the House Of Commons.

Another Post Office cat called Simon was
commended for his work in keeping down
the rodent populatipn at the largest telephone
exchange in the North of England, at Salford.
Simon had to patrol over 100,000 square feet
of office space, and he was on duty for 24

”hours every day.

Yet another excellent mouser was Jerry, of
Earls Court post office in London. He
served the building for 16 years and drove all
the mice away from the premises.

STILL FIRM FAVOURITES

ODAY. with the faster movement of the
I mail and more hygienic surroundings.
Post Office cats are not always
needed to keep down the rodent population.
But many post offices still employ them and

. they become great friends with the postmen.
1 who often feed them.

When one cat suffered an accident at work
it was taken promptly to the vet in a nearby
city to receive the best attention -—- and the
Post Office willingly footed the bill.

One much-loved country cat even found
her way into a mail bag and was transported
to London. She was found in quite a sorry
state when the bag was opened at the main
sorting office.

However. she was so well loved that she
was given a first-class seat on a train back
to her post office home. It was reported that
she enjoyed the journey very muchl

Today, there are fewer cats employed by
the Post Office than at any time in the past.
Their profession is yet another example of
one laid low by the advances of new
technology but. according to the Post Ofﬁce.
there is no plan for their services to be
discontinued in the forseeable future! [I

French also said he had never
seen a more severe case of live-

suffers basically the same as a
human being,” he said. “It’s a

 

 

stock neglect.

Harris said the cattle —— of
Santa Gertrudis stock -- num-
bered about 1,200 head. The
King Ranch, the largest ranch in
the United States, covering more
than 800,000 acres in six counties
between Harlingen and Corpus
Christi, sent the animals north in
July because of the drought in
South Texas, York said.

“I guess they didn’t realize we
had a drought up here, too,” said
Elliot White, who owns 3,700
acres next to the leased spread.

White had suspected problems
on the Westfall property. Several
of the King Ranch cows —— with
their “flying W” brand —— had
knocked down fences to graze on
White’s land. “They were obvi—
ously hungry,” he said.

What White didn’t see, howev-
er, were the animals too weak to
escape the nearly depleted pas-
ture. ‘

After recent rains, the ranch’s
foreman hired David Johnson
and Jim Kick to herd the live-
stock out of ditches and other
low-lying areas, Hicks said.

“I thought it was a thrill and
an honor to do work for the King
Ranch,” said Kick, 39, a construc-
tion worker and part-time cow-
boy. “But when I got out there, I
was really disgusted.”

He said the animals were “skin
and bones.” Many had Worms,
others had foam spewing from
their mouths from dehydration,
and some were blind from near-
starvation, Kick said. He counted
at least 40 orphan calves. Other

calves were mooing loudly be
cause their mothers could no
produce milk.

French said he heard at leas
60 animals had died. Harris said
“One of my deputies alone foun
25 carcasses.”

Johnson, who with Kick noti
ﬂed the sheriff, estimated tha
the animals required at least 4|
rolls of hay daily. “It looks lik
they were getting maybe three 0
four rolls. This situation didn’
develop overnight. They’ve bee
underfed for weeks or months.”

Casey Risinger, a Terrell veter
inarian summoned by the sheri
to examine the livestock, said th
animals appeared at least 25 pe
cent underweight. Cows th
should have weighed 1,20
pounds weighed only 800 or 90
pounds, he said.

“With the proper nutritio
most of them will recover,” Ri
inger said.

Where Wings Get -Well

Ralph Heath had the inclination; all
he needed was the ﬁrst patient.

So when the pre—med student (with a
degree in zoology) saw a wounded cor-
morant, soon to be dubbed 'Maynard,
dragging its wing across a Florida high-
way, the ﬁrst rescue mission of the

future Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary '

swung into action. With the help of his
physician father“ (and the knowledge
Ralph had gained by watching sur-
geries since childhood), Maynard’s
wing. set to mending.

Today, Heath’s “hospital” cares day
after day for the sick and wounded
among the winged species on a sun-
drenched acre at Indian Shores, 10
miles north of St. Petersburg. During
one particular afternoon, much like al-
most any day here, small children spill
out of a station wagon and rush a tiny,
too-sick-to-chirp bird to healing hands.
A jogger, still glistening from an inter-
rupted run, presents a shoebox with
the baby dove he found lodged in a
chain link fence.

And many times, birds simply ar-
rive, through some sort of needy intui-
tion, wanting to be treated. “Now we
have about 15 to 20 birds admitted a
day,” says Heath, who operates his
sanctuary largely with family, staff,
and many volunteers. “We. save about
50%, and about half of those return to
the air.”

Visitors are invited to join in activi-
ties here—from the celebration of re-

leasing a bird back to the sky to
watching the daily feeding and tending
to the recovering patients. The em—
ployees and volunteers gladly share the
stories, pointing out, for instance, one
bird with a gash from a ﬁshing hook,
another shot and blinded by a hunter,
still more tangled and mangled by
nylon ﬁshing line.

But the sanctuary is not an atmo—
sphere with sickly, droopy inhabitants.
Instead, well-marked pens enable visi-
tors to stroll the grounds to watch the
various species on the mend; many are
often cavorting with the energy a re-
turn to health can bring. Backyard
birds, such as bluejays, mockingbirds,
and doves; seabirds, such as herons
and egrets; and up to 40 other species
can be found here. Even birds of
prey, including hawks, owls, and ea—

gles, arrive for special attention.

The Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary op-
erates on the theory of three “R’s.”
“That’s rescue, repair, and recupera-
tion,” explains Heath. “And, of
course, we like to add release to that
process. But we’re also here to ensure
that birds carry on their lines—particu—
larly the Eastern brown pelican.”

That story began with Alexis and
Salty, both crippled and unable to re-
turn to their former lives. Their off-
spring, a healthy youngster named
Pax, was the ﬁrst in the breeding pro-
gram that now boasts a release of more
than 500 young pelicans. In fact, their
numbers have increased sufﬁciently for
Heath to escort eight permanently
crippled Florida West Coast brown
pelicans to their new home in the
Greek islands, and another 30 of that
species (along with a selection of terns.
cormorants, snowy egrets, oyster
catchers, and red-tailed hawks) to Sin-
gapore’s Jurong Bird Park. Other
mended (but unable to be released)
birds from the beachside facility now
perpetuate their breeds in Bermuda
and England.

While there’s much room for cele—
bration, Heath pauses without joy to
contemplate the need for his sanc-

' tuary. “We try to make it clear how the

birds got here,” he says. “And that’s
largely because of man. Power lines.
Hunting or ﬁshing incidents. Cars and
trucks. It’s not right to put birds to
sleep because they’ve been hurt by
man. We’ll work on them all night—
they have a right to live.”

Sanctuary on Gulf Boulevard in Indian
Shores, Florida, is small, so watch

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - October 31, 1988

Lion Bites .

vg‘ .

By George Williamson
Chronicle 5th Writer

A crazed young sea lion that
attacked and hit two people —
one in the bay and one on land
-— on Saturday morning may
still be lurking in the deep wa-
ters of San Francisco Bay.

The sea mammal’s shark-like
assault on a man swimming off
Aquatic Park particularly stunned
experts at the Marine Mammal Cen-
ter in Sausalito. '

. The marauding sea lion is “one

of a kind,” said Mary Jane
Schramm, the center’s director of
public relations and a sea-mammal
admirer who is glad that neither
. victim was seriously hurt.

“He just swam up to the poor
guy and gratuitously hit him on the
side of the chest and on the foot. ~

“We’ve never even heard; of
something like that, where a sea
lion would actually attack some-
body swimming. In the water, the
animal typically feels it has nothing
to fear from a human.”

The biting sea lion is young and
relatively small —— between 60 and
80 pounds. A full-grown adult male
can reach 650 pounds, a female
- about 250. It has two red tags on its
foreflippers, meaning it was born
- near the Channel Islands off Santa
Barbara.

Schramm said the best guess is
that the sea lion has been made
mean and cranky by a disease called
Leptospirosis, an often fatal bacteri-
al sickness of the liver and kidney
that is currently plaguing sea lions
in this area. However, a veterinari-
an set the bite posed no danger of
transmitting the disease to the
(swimmer.

The swimmer, an unidentified

San Mateo man, suffered bad

Standards necessary for raising farm animals

Your recommendation of a no
vote on Question 3 might be un—
derstandable if there were not so
many inaccuracies in your discus-
sion.

1) It will not cost $90 million to
implement the act. The figure was
generated on the false assumption
that dairy farmers would have to
replace the existing stanchions
with another system. Even the
Humane Society of the United
States approves of stanchions.

2) Chicks were killed by suffo-
cation. a fate as grisly as grinding.
as recently as 1988. it was during
the preparation of this initiative
petition that the practice was dis-
continued.

3) The Massachusetts Depart-
ment of Food and Agriculture and
the legislative committee heard an
abundance of testimony about
abuses in this country. Further-
more. the fact that an agency can-
not find records of written or tele-
phone complaints about inhu-
mane conditions does not mean
these conditions do not exist.

‘ 4) Temperature control simply
'means ventilation and protection
from freezing, not air condition—
ing.

Farmers will not go out of busi—
ness. The act was written with
special care to ensure the survival
of the family farm. '

First. the commissioner of the
department, a farmer himself. will
Write the regulations. This same
department. which is committed
to helping the farming industry,
will enforce the regulations. Sec—
ond. if there is a hardship. the de~
partment can issue and keep re-

newing waivers for most of the;

regulations.

You must note that recommen- "

dations to the commissioner by
the advisory board are nonbind-
ing. And while four members of
the advisory board would be from
animal-welfare groups, there is an
existing advisory board made up
entirely of farm-industry advo-
cates.

During its preparation. the pe—
tition was circulated to solicit
comments from the department
and other interested parties. Now
those same people say that it is
flawed!

In Massachusetts, thousands-
of chickens spend their entire
lives six to a cage that is four
inches wider than the Globe‘s edi-
torial page. They cannot even
stretch their wings. Is this accept-
able?

Veal calves are tied in boxes 22
inches wide. Have we become so
desensitized by all the violence
around us that we can close our
eyes to-this kind of practice?
Should we treat helpless living
creatures like transistor radioson
an assembly line? \ ‘

The MSPCA has very little as
thority to stop inhumane prac-
tices except as they affect dogs,
horses and a few other animals. if
it could protect all the other ani-
mals, we would not still have the
terrible conditions described
above in Massachusetts.

That is why regulations and
standards for raising animals are
needed.

ALFRED F. FERULLO

WASHINGTON —— A major envi-
ronmental study Tuesday recom-
mended that Congress set a nation-
al goal of reversing the centuries-
old trend of destroying more
wetlands than are created.

The report called on Congress
to approve legislation encouraging
the formation of wetlands preserva-
tion trusts, perhaps by restoring
some tax incentives for land dona-
tions that were restricted by the
1986 tax law overhaul.

The study group, called the Na-
tional Wetlands Policy Forum, is
composed of state and federal gov-
ernment officials, industry repre-
sentativesand environmental inter-
ests. It was convened by the
Conservation Foundation, a private
Washington-based research group,
at the request of the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).

The report urged Congress to
add wetlands restoration and cre-
ation to the missions of the Army
Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of
Reclamation, the Soil Conservation
Service, the Federal Highway Ad-
ministration, the Tennessee Valley
Authority and other agencies.

It said these agencies, along
with the Fish and Wildlife Service
and the National Marine Fisheries
Service, should be required to orga-
nize a major effort to seek out pub—
lic lands for restoration, especially
where government activity had
caused wetlands to be lost.

Existing federal and state pro-
tective programs are “too cumber-
some and the responsibilities too
diffuse" to guarantee protection of
wetlands, the report said.

“It is a system that allows hun-
dreds of thousands of wetland acres
to continue to be lost or degraded
annually, almost unnoticed, while
substantial resources and time of-
ten are devoted to determining the
fate ofa few relatively small areas,"

“The fact that the protection of
wetlands makes good economic as
well as environmental sense for. so-
ciety but not necessarily for the in-
dividual owning them is central to
much of the conflict over wetlands
projtection policies," the report
331 .

Setting a national goal of revers-
ing the trend toward a shrinking
wetlands base “does not imply that
individual wetlands will in every in-
stance be untouchable.” the report
said. It said the aim should be that
“the nation’s overall wetlands base
reach equilibrium between losses
and gains in the short run and in-
crease in the long term.”

Gov. Thomas H. Kean of New
Jersey served as chairman of the
wetlands policy forum, with Govs.
Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South
Carolina and Booth Gardner of
Washington as vice chairmen.

No one knows how fast swamps,
marshes, bogs and other wetlands
are being lost at present, although
the 200 million acres at the time
Europeans settled what became the
lower 48 states are believed to have
been cut in half through conversion
to farms, urban settlement and oth-
er uses.

One study estimated that in the
two decades leading up to 1975,
400.000 to 500,000 acres were lost
every year.

Only in recent decades has it
become widely recognized that wet-
lands serve important environmen-
tal functions by storing flood water,
supporting a third of the nation‘s
endangered species, nursing and
spawning 60 percent to 90 percent
of commercial fish catches, reduc-
ing erosion, recharging groundwa~
ter, filtering sediment and control-
ling poll ition. . .

A lawsuit was expected to be ﬁled today
or early next week by the parents of a
3-year-old Phoenix girl maimed by three
Rottweilers in September.

And there were indications that Maricopa
County might be named as a defendant
along with Simon Moreau, the owner of the
dogs.

“A suit is imminent,” Jim Hart, attorney
for Alphonso Larry Lopez and Helen

Padilla, parents of Linda Lopez, said
Thursday.

Hart said he had been awaiting the
outcome of Thursday’s hearing at which the
three dogs belonging to Simon Moreau were
ordered destroyed by Maricopa County
Superior Court Judge Barry Schneider.

Hart said the list of defendants had not
been decided upon, nor had the amount to
be asked.

Ibex makes 40-foot
leap from bridge

'LOS ANGELES —— A wild goat
believed begotten in sprawling
Grifﬁth Park of other goats that
escaped the zoo four years ago was
captured following a last-ditch 40-
foot leap for freedom from a bridge,
ofﬁcials said.

The brown, 45-pound male Be
zoar ibex, with white tuiting and
curving foot—long horns, was esti-

thought to be an offspring of two of
the 11 goats that escaped the Los
Angeles Zoo in 1984, said Bob
Barnes, a zoo curator of mammals.

It was captured last week by two
animal-control ofﬁcers who res-
cued it from drowning in 6~foot
, deep water following its jump into
3 the concrete Los Angeles River
channel.

“It was a spectacular thing,” said
Michael Burns, an animal shelter
supervisor. “This goat has more
heart than any animal I’ve seen for
a long while.”

Barnes said the 11 animals,
f which also are known as wild Per—
sian goats, were obtained by the
zoo from New Mexico game au-
thorities. Two females were recap-

uring 1986, but ofﬁcials have re-
peived no reports since then.

Ofﬁcials had ﬁrst believed the
captured goat was one of the escap-
ees, but after determining its ap-
proximate age, ofﬁcials decided it
had been born in the wild. ,

“The park is a perfect place for
these animals to survive,” Barnes
,' said. The species ranges from east-
ern Turkey to Pakistan. The ani-
mals are capable of living from sea
level to 12,000 feet in the moun-
tains of Afghanistan.

Central Animal Shelter was noti-

dering behind an ofﬁce near the
Los Angeles River.

“Rather than be captured by a
rope, it went out on the Glendale
Boulevard overpass above the flood
channel,” Burns said.

“It jumped onto the railing and
then leaped about 10 feet below to a
21/2-foot precipice. Again, rather
than have us capture it, the goat
just took off, leaping until gravity
took over and it fell more than 40
feet below.” .

The goat landed in 1 foot of
water and “went down to its
knees,” then moved into water over
its head, Burns said.

Two wildlife specialists from the
city Animal Regulation Depart-
ment, Dennis Kroepiin and Larry
Morales, saw the animal frantically
trying to tread water. They jumped
in the water and each man grabbed
one of the goat’s horns to wrestle it
back to safety.

After it was taken to a corral at
the shelter, the goat once again

DHAKA, Bangladesh
Man-eating tigers provoke a ca.
cophony of terror when they come

out to feed in the forests of
‘ southern Bangladesh.

At dusk, when Royal Bengal
tigers stir from their lairs, villagers
living on the edge of the Sunder-
bans forest blow trumpets and ex-
plode ﬁrecrackers to try shooing
away the great beasts.

“This is almost a ritual around
the jungles,” said forestry ofﬁcial
Gholam Habib. “It often helps save
lives.”

Often, but not always. About a
ﬁfth of the Sundarbans’ estimated
500 tigers are man-eaters, and the
magnificent but fearsome animals
are again killing increasing num-
bers of people after a period of
declining activity. '

Attacks by the tigers, who grow
to 10 feet in length, have led village

or to seek spirit “protection” by
sacriﬁcing bulls to a jungle deity.

45 people killed in nine months

Tigers have killed 45 people in
the Sundarbans in the last nine
months, compared with 33 in all of
1987 and 16 the year before. Most
attacks occur at night. ‘

The mutilated body of one of the
latest victims, 40-yearsold wood-
cutter Hanif Hawlader, was recow
ered from a marsh on Oct. 10.

Habib said attacks would in-
crease in coming months as thou.
sands of people make seasonal for-
ays to collect timber deep in the
forest where the Royal Bengals
have their lairs.

Forest official Abul Kashem
said in one village alone, in one
month, tigers killed about 20 cows
and buffaloes and injured a man.

The tigers are listed as an en-
dangered species. The tidal man-
grove forest on the Bay of Bengal
has seen a rise in their numbers to
at least 500 from 300 in 1985,
thanks partly to a decade~old ban
on hunting in the Sundarbans.

 

Deer population doubles

Numbers of birds, crocodiles
and other animals also have in.
creased and the deer population
has almost doubled to 100,000 since

1985.

Forest ofﬁcials say they are hap-
py about the rise in the tiger popu-~
lation -— an opinion shared by few
of the 40,000 people who live in the
villages on the edge of the Sunder-
bans or who work in it.

One morning in October, villagy“
ers awoke to see a tiger prowling in .

the early winter fog. Women and'
children screamed and ran for cov~
er as forest rangers arrived and
opened ﬁre at the growling preda~ ,
tor. It fled unharmed in the confuo
sion.

The 2,250 square mile forest is

_a place of outstanding natural

beauty

At sunset, spotted deer, mon-
keys and crocodiles can be seen
thronging the desolate Bay of Ben-
gal beaches. Large bats glide over
green treetops in search of wild ﬁgs
and insects.

During the day, thousands of
birds, including white- breasted
kites and wild ducks, sweep:
through the sky.

The government sees the area as ;
a potential tourist attraction and
plans to build a game sanctuary at ‘
Hiron Point, 70 miles from the.

Ironically, the Sundarbansi.
tourist prospects are threatened
more by man than by tigers.‘

Animal Rights Activist
Accused of Bomb Attempt
Called Odd by Neighbors

The Associated Press

NORWALK, Conn. —— An animal
rights activist accused of planting a
pipe bomb that police said could
have killed an executive whose
company uses dogs in medical ex-
periments “meant no harm,” her fa-
ther said Saturday.

Neighbors of Fran Stephanie
Trutt, 33, of New York City de-
scribed her as strange and said she
often talked with animals.

“Of. course she’s innocent, she
meant no harm,” said Harry Trutt,
the woman’s father, when contacted
Saturday at his home in New Hyde
Park. He refused further comment,
except to say his daughter hoped to
select an attorney by Tuesday.

Norwalk police arrested Ms.
Trutt just after midnight Friday and
planned to hold her through the
weekend under $500,000 bond pend-
ing arraignment in Superior Court
Monday on charges of attempted
murder, possession of explosives
and manufacturing a bomb.

1 Ms. Trutt is accused of planting
a powerful, radio-controlled bomb
in bushes at. the Norwalk headquar-
ters of US. Surgical Corp, near the
parking space of company Chair-
man Leon Hirsch. The bomb was
wrapped with roofing nails, which
would have acted as projectiles.

About 200 people were working
in the plant overnight at the time of
the incident.

A search of the woman’s base-
ment apartment turned up three
more homemade bombs fashioned

______________________J

from standard plumbing pipes, said
New York City police Deputy In-
spector Vincent Tarone.

Police said the bombs were
made of large ﬁrecrackers, called
M-80s, wrapped with nails and BB
pellets and stuffed into pipes.

The devices “certainly would
have destroyed the entire building"
and damaged surrounding houses,

‘Mr. Tarone said.

Several hundred residents near
Ms. Trutt’s home in Queens were
evacuated for several hours Friday

afternoon while police searched the ‘-

apartment.

Police also found a sawed-off
shotgun, a homemade weapon de—
scribed as a cross between a bazoo-
ka and a shotgun, and pictures of
animal torture in her apartment.

Ms. Trutt also rents a garage in
New York City where police found
several emaciated dogs she appar-
ently was trying to nurse back to
health.

New York City police spokes~
man Sgt. Norris Hollomon said Ms.
Trutt would face charges of crimi-
nal possession of a dangerous weap-
on and possibly other charges.

The FBI also was investigating

 

,w‘

the incident “as a possible terrorist ,

act and for several federal viola-
tions,” police said.

A neighbor, Rebecca Rollins,
said Ms. Trutt “told one neighbor

Bird refuge opponents _

By The Associated Press

COKEVILLE, Wyo. — Oppo-
nents of a plan to establish a bird
refuge near Cokeville say the fed-
eral government already owns too
much land in the area and they
worry the project could have ad-
verse economic effects.

But federal officials remain opti-
mistic they will prevail in estab-
lishing the controversial refuge. At
a public hearing last week, 15
speakers favored the proposed
27,000-acre Bear Valley wetlands.

Outside support

Harvey Wittmier, a US. Fish
and Wildlife Service biologist and
the agency’s land acquisition plan-
ner in Denver, said, “I felt good
there was support from outside the
area, and even some of the state-
ments from within the .area were
generally supportive.”

Federal wildlife officials want to
produce 9,500 ducks and 4,000 geese
and to maintain 60 to 80 pairs of
sandhill cranes along the Bear Riv-
er south of Cokeville. They also

plan to maintain populations of 65'

species of shore and wading birds
that use the area, and protect the
“occasional whooping crane” that
comes through.

Size cut in half

The size of the proposed refuge
was cut in half and other changes
were made after local residents
opposed the project at a meeting
last year.

Supporters of the project said
the refuge is needed to offset the

.- steady nationwide loss of wetlands

habitat, a loss some experts put as
high as 450,000 acres a year. Propo—
nents said tourism and hunting
generated by the project would en-
hance economic development in
the area.

rimeter of the refuge, four have‘in-
dicated unwillingness to sell, ac-
cording to Wittmier. One rancher
opposed to the project said the fed-
eral government already owns too
much land in the area.

“The founding fathers . . . tried
to limit the amount of land the US.
government could own,” rancher
Dale Weston said.

‘Cancer on valley’

Brent Roberts, a Cokeville build»
ing contractor, called the proposed
refuge “a cancer on the valley that
will ultimately consume it.”

He said an area banker had told
him banks would not be willing to
finance any sort of “tourist trap”
in Cokeville and would not accept
as collateral anything in the valley
based on tourism. He charged that
support for the project comes from ,
outsiders who have no stake in the
future of the community.

But area rancher J .R. Thornock,
speaking in favor of the proposal,
noted declining employment in the
area and the fact that only eight
children entered kindergarten this
year. He called wildlife “3 real at-
traction” and said it was time for ,
Cokeville to enter the “changing '
mainstream of. economic develop- ~
ment.”

. MIAMI ~— An angler recently
, landed a 548-pound tiger shark dur-
ing a fishing tournament off Flori-
da’s Panhandle. A shark of that
Size and species isn’t unusual in the
northeastern Gulf of Mexico, but
this one was. It had no fins. Some-
bne had cut them off. .
'; It was graphic evidence of a
practice called firming, the grue-
some underside of a growing shark
harvest that could end with some
species being wiped out in Florida
waters.

And in part, it’s because Oriental

Consumers from the Philippines to .

Sri Lanka show an unquenchable
demand for what many believe is
an aphrodisiac and panacea for ev-
erything from arthritis to cancer:
" shark fin soup.

Shark fin soup is a broth made
‘ by boiling dried shark fins to ex-
tract a jellylike substance from the

interior membranes. The gel looks
like clear noodles.

“It’s very popular all over the
Orient,” says Yiu Luke, a Miami
exporter who sends shark fins
from Florida and the Caribbean to
Oriental markets.

“In the Orient, many peOple be-
lieve shark fin soup is also good for
curing disease. Scientists are using
sharks to study how to cure can-
cer. And people believe shark fin
soup cures arthritis, rheumatism
and diabetes.” ,

Florida shark fishermen earn up
to $12 a pound for the fins - four
times what they get for lobster.

Marine biologists say fin'ning is
only the worst excess of a market
for sharks that is also fueled by
trendy Florida, New England and
California restaurants, which may
not specialize in shark fin soup but
are offering more and more shark-
meat entrees. .

That means fewer and fewer
sharks. And because the shark
takes longer to reach reproductive
age than most other fish, and be-
cause it produces far fewer young,
it is more vulnerable to being
wiped out.

Most fish reach breeding age in
two or three years and produce
hundreds of millions of eggs each
year. But most sharks require 10 to
15 years to mature —- and then pro-
duce only eight to 14 young per
year.

“You can just about wipe out a
species like Spanish mackerel, and
if you leave them alone for three or
four years they usually come right
back,” said Samuel “Sonny” Grub-
er, a University of Miami scientist.
“But if you knock off a lot of the
sharks in an area, it will be a long,
long time before they come back.”

Finning is not illegal in Florida
because shark fishing is unregu-

lated, but it concerns biologists be-
cause it allows fishermen to deci-
mate many more sharks in a day
than if they were harvesting the
entire carcass.

No one knows how common fin-
ning is, but enough mutilated
sharks have been caught to make
scientists believe that it’s practic-
ed by an uncomfortably large mi-
nority of commercial shark fisher-
men. '

The practice is reminiscent of
the buffalo hunts of the 18605 and
’708, when hunters slaughtered
millions of animals for their hides
and left the carcasses to rot on the
prairies.

Shark meat sells wholesale for
$1 to $1.25 a pound in the winter,
but in the summer, when the price
drops to 50 cents, some fishermen
apparently figure the meat isn’t
worth their time — and they sim-
ply harvest the fins.

~ l

get bill
of rights

By The New York Times
STOCKHOLM, Sweden -- The

Swedish welfare state, long re-

nowned for its generosity and

scope, is extending its reach into
a new frontier: the barnyard.

Under an animal-welfare law
enacted in July, cattle, pigs and
chickens are freed from the re-
strictions of so-called factory-
farming methods.

Cattle get grazing rights. Pigs
can no longer be tethered and
must be granted separate bed-
ding and feeding places. CoWs
and pigs must have “access to
straw and litter.” Chickens must
be let out of their cramped
cages. No drugs or hormones can
be used except to treat disease.

Besides the inherent concerns
about humane treatment of ani-
mals and food quality, the legis-
lation reflects the extraordinary
political clout in Sweden of an
81-year-old writer, Astrid Lind-
gren.

One of the" world’s most widely
read authors of children’s books,
perhaps best-known as the cre-
ator of the character “Pippi
Longstocking,” Lindgren demon-
strated the power of the pen in
Swedish affairs by writing a se-
ries of satirical allegories in lead-
ing newspapers, underscoring
the plight of farm animals and

fueling the animal-welfare cam-
paign. Most of the requirements
will be phased in over the next
few years, but the provision
making all chickens free rangers
will be stretched over several
years to give farmers time to
build more spacious accommo-
dations. When discussing the is-
sue, Lindgren’s comments are
laced, with the same wry edge as
her stories. For example, she is
no supporter of one modern
farming practice not mentioned
in the new law: artificial insemi-
nation. “I’ve always been a great
fan of cows,” she said. “And
when I was young, a cow was as-
sured of at least one happy day a

year. The day she got to visit the
bull.”

“Sweden is now the leader in
this field,” said Madelaine Em-
mervall, first secretary in the
Ministry of Agriculture. “It’s the
best law internationally — the
best for the animals.”

For more than a decade, Swe-
den had a vocal animal-welfare
lobby, yet it tended to focus
mainly on curbing the use of ani—
mals in scientific experiments.

In recent years, Lindgren has
been responsible for making the
treatment of farm animals a live-
1y issue, and the animal-rights
legislation sailed through Parlia-
ment all but unopposed.

 

By The Associated Press . .
CRAIG -— Stockman Lou Wyman
has fed, doctored and sold bulls,
cows and calves on his Williams
Fork River ranch over the past 22

years, weathering the lean times .

and waiting for new markets to de-

. velop.

What sets Wyman apart from
your usual stockman is that he
raises elk and now has about 200
head.

Strange behavior

“The operation is about the same
as any cow outfit,” except fencing
is -a whole lot more expensive, he
said. .

“Elk are funny animals to work
around. They look very calm from
a distance, but the minute you get
close to them they get real hyper.
The only time you can really herd
them is in the winter when food is
a big incentive,” said Wyman.

When elk are young they tend to
be harder to keep in the fenced en-
closures. ,

“That’s one of the risks that you
take. If you can’t keep them from
running off at $500 to $2,500 a head
you can lose quite a bit of money
pretty fast,” Wyman said.

“We experimented with a lot of
different types of fencing, which
was the biggest part of the startup
(costs). When we found one that
worked, the cost of fencing just the
one pasture was close to $25,000 at
five dollars per foot,” he said. .

Still, he said elk are much more
efficient per grazing acre than cat-
tle and “they are pretty immune to

most disease and you don’t have '

much problem with calving.”

Wyman said he started the VCH'.
ture with the idea of having limited;
hunts. But he changed his mind.

‘ the ins and outs of fences i

completely, choosing to raise the
elk for an international market.

Now one of his biggest markets '
is Canadian ranchers who are be-
ing encouraged by their govern-
ment to raise meat other than
sheep and cattle.

“We have sold almost every part
of the animal at one time or anoth- :
er. We have sold horns and the
blood to Korea, the leg joints to the
Chinese, bladders from the bulls
for cancer experiments, urine to!
bowhunters and we’ve even sold
the tails . . . just the tails,” he re» .
called.

The animal-parts buyers are
tough businessmen, he said.

“It is very tough to trade with
them. I have been very impressed
at how formal they are about their '
business dealings. We are pretty '
laid back around here and these
fellas will show up here dressed in
suits with Rolex watches and dia-
monds on their fingers. ‘ -

“They find out about us through
the Division of Wildlife and ,
through word of mouth so they .
pretty much come to us,” Wyman
explained. -

Wyman also sells elk meat to the
Flagstaff House restaurant in
Boulder, and has jerky made in
Spanish Fork, Utah.

He does not allow private hunts
on his elk herd, which is kept in a
fenced pasture. ' '

The only time an animal from
that herd is killed is to cull animals
that do not serve the breed well, he
said.

sophisticated formal

tried their very best,

of course, to act la-

dylike, refined and

cool. But some sim-

ply couldn’t manage. Instead, they
just stood there . . . swooned . . .
and stared.

At movie star Robert Wagner,
that is.

Wagner was the celebrity guest
. at Friday’s Celebrity Paws Gala

fund-raiser benefiting Citizens for’ '

Animal Protection. And no doubt
about it —— most of the women who
came to this $100-per-ticket Hyatt
Regency Hotel event were heavy-
duty fans. At least 100 of them
(out of 360 men and women
guests) brought along cameras in
true teeny-hopper, star-struck fash-
ion.

Wagner definitely looked debo-
nair and gorgeous. And women
were determined to get a close
look. So, all night long — during
’ cocktails, the seated dinner, the
program and the after-party —-
Wagner was bombarded by auto-
graph and photograph seekers. He
remained cordial through it all.

Until . . . this reporter asked him
the question: “What about your fu-
ture plans with Jill St. John?”

Well, let’s just say he wasn’t the
slightest bit interested in answer-
ing. His only reply (as he looked
me coldly in the eyes): “ Why do
you want to know?” So . . . son'y
folks. No scoop here.

Wagner graciously let event
chairwoman Hershey Grace auc-
tion off a romantic slow dance with
him. This one-time-only, three-

$3,600. Georgia Leonard, who was
in Houston from Los Angeles visit—
ing friends, was the ecstatic top
bidder.

Leonard probably kicked herself
later in the evening when several
rafﬂe winners walked on stage to
claim their prizes and Wagner con-
gratulated and kissed each one of
them smack-dab on the lips. And to
think — their rafﬂe tickets only
cost $1. Now, they may not be the
types to kiss and tell, so . . . some
who eagerly puckered up were
Beverly Brannan, Ruth Spiers, Pat—
ty Davis and Gudrun Evans.

Raffle tickets were sold during
the cocktail hour by 10 women
with their pets in tow who were vy-

clude Nancy Ames, Marta Clegg,
Carolyn Farb, Celia Goldstein,
Kathy Hanna, Barbara Jefferson,

Pavlas, Julie Steinhagen and Peg

have titled it Celebrity Saleswom-

mined by how many rafﬂe tickets
she sold. Top winner was Clegg
and her dog Boogie (she sold $900
worth); runner-up was Pavlas and
her dogs Sophie and A.J. (890 tick-

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - November 6, 1988

For gorillas,
infertility a
weighty issue

By Peter Gomer
Chicago Tribune

Just how fat should a gorilla
be?

That’s a question being pon—
dered by zoologists concerned
about increasing infertility
among captive gorillas. They are
speculating that the animals may
be too fat to reproduce.

But merely cutting back on
their food would be no solution,
because that causes stress. And
zoo animals that are stressed
won’t reproduce either. _

“Gorillas feed in groups and
it’s hard to stop individuals from
pigging out,” said Mark
Rosenthal, curator of mammals
at Lincoln Park Zoo. “Yet we
don’t want our gorillas to eat
themselves into extinction.”

About 270 captive lowland
gorillas live in the nation’s zoos.
Experts fear that as many as one-
third of the 130 females are hav-
ing pregnancy problems, while
another third seem infertile after
having produced only one baby.

“The long-term survival of this

species is starting toworry a lot
of us,” said Rosenthal. .
7 At ﬁrst glance, Lincoln Park,
home to the nation’s largest colo-
ny of 21 gorillas, would seem to
have no problem. The 200
represents a major success story
in gorilla maternity. Since 1970,
there have been 29 baby gorillas
born there—21 since the new
Great Ape House opened in
1976.

Just last month, in fact, a
female named Kusuma gave birth
to a baby, but she won’t let any
human examine it, so the sex re—
mains unknown. Another female,
Benga—whose crowd-pleasing

Imate, Otto, died unexpectedly
last summer—is expected to de-
liver any day.

Nonetheless, zoo ofﬁcials are

( concerned because 6 of their 13
.. females, all former mothers, have
stopped bearing young. Ranging
in age from 18 to 30, the infertile
3 females are pioneers in a land-
{mark scientiﬁc study to deter-
, mine if they are, indeed, too fat.
5,, But just how fat should a goril—
ii-la be?

. “Beats me,” said zoo veterinar-
;*~ian Thomas Meehan. “Until now,
’we’ve known virtually nothing

about gorilla obesity, and the re-

_ lationship of diet and exercise to

reproductive ability.”

In order to ﬁnd out, Meehan
and his assistant, Dr. Peregrine
Wolff, have been anesthetizing
some of the females and taking
them to the zoo hospital for a
careful analysis of their body
composition.

“Human obesity studies are
common,” Meehan pointed out.
“But this marks the ﬁrst time for
gorillas.” *

Last Monday, a telltale musty
aroma hung in the hospital air as
Kowali, a 10-year-old female, lay
sprawled on the operating table,
dreaming gorilla dreams.

“Kowali’s normal. She has no

'trouble having babies,” Meehan

said. “We’re trying to ﬁgure out

why.”

The bearded 'Meehan glanced

I over at a nearby table where Joe,

Kuwali’s 2—year-old son, also
slept peacefully. Joe had injured
his right foot, and Wolff was tak-
ing an X—ray.

“Gorilla moms don’t volunteer
their babies to be knocked out

and X-rayed,” noted Meehan.
“So we had to tranquilize Kowali

' too. While she’s here, we’ll do

our experiment.”

To determine her body com-
position, Meehan used deuterium
oxide, or heavy water, a nonra-
dioactive isotope that can be ,an-
alyzed after it mixes with ordi-
nary body ﬂuids.

After weighing Kowali, who
tipped the scales at a reasonably
svelte 206 pounds, Meehan injec-
ted a measured amount of heavy
water into her body. Over two
hours, the deuterium diffused
evenly throughout the water in
body cells. Then, a blood sample
was withdrawn. ‘

“After complex lab work, we
can determine the total amount
of body water,” Meehan said.
“From that, we can calculate the
leanbody mass, because water

resides in lean tissue, but never
{in fat. By subtracting these fig-
? ures from the—animal’s weight, we

lcan determine how much fat she
as.”

The goal is to” establish a

_»-. benchmark of ideal gorjltg'pody

weight. Lincoln Park’s study" is
part of an international Gorilla
Species Survival Plan, in which
zoos are generating seientific
data, and sharing breeding
animals to add vigor to the gene
pool. ‘
Because gorillas are considered,
with chimpanzees, to be

: mankind’s closest genetic rela—

tive, zoologists are consulting
human infertility research for
clues to the mystery of gorilla in-

. fertility.

Sex is no problem, scientists
believe. Unlike species that refuse
to breed in captivity, gorillas are
not shy.

“Quite the contrary,’
Meehan. “They love it.” ,

Yet, like many infertile women,
infertile female gorillas often lack

’

noted

. the hormone progesterone, which
f must be present for a budding

embryo‘to cling to ,t‘heWall of the
,Vuterus. . ‘ . -~

“So far, our pregesterOne levels

' aren’t bad,” Meehan said, adding
that the 200 attributes its wealth
of gorilla babies to proper foods,

,D“ - .-

spacious facilities and a deep under-
standing of the nwds of these senSi-
tive animals.

(_}orillas, which come into estrus
each month, reproduce slowly under

. the best of circumstances. A mother

may nurse her baby for four years
and not have another during that
period. Thus, infertility gravely
threatens the long-term survival of
the species, which is declining in the
wild.

The scientists eventually hope
to adjust the gorillas’ diets of
monkey chow, fruits and vegeta-
bles to favor reproduction. But

' Rosenthal believes there may be

more to the story than diet
alone.

Unlike zoos that isolate their
gorillas, Lincoln Park encourages
its animals to closely interact
with their keepers and the public.

’“The gorillas tend to look upon
us as part of their troupe,” said
Pat Sass. senior keeper of the
great apes. “We give them toys

to play with, treats to forage for, '

and we place young animals with
gentle oldsters,” she said. _

_

I The beating of an elephant at the San Diego Wild Animal Park has caused
an uproar in California, and may lead to the enactment of state legislation to
provide greater protection for animals in zoos. The elephant, an 18-year-old
wild-caught African female named Medundamella (”Dunda” for short), was
transferred from the San Diego Zoo to the San Diego Wild Animal Park (both
operated by the San Diego Zoological Society) in February of this year. Trainers
at the zoo say the transfer was poorly planned, noting that Dunda was given
no time to become familiar with her new keepers or with the crate in which
she was to be transported. Following arrival at the Wild Animal Park, Dunda
exhibited fear and aggression which, according to elephant training supervisor
Alan Roocroft, necessitated “discipline." Under Roocroft’s direction, five in-
dividuals chained Dunda to the ground in a spread-eagle position and beat
her over the head with ax handles on several occassions over a period of two
or more days, out of sight in a barn at the park. Dunda was struck at least a
hundred times, causing her so much agony that she ”rolled over on her side
and moaned,” according to Steve Friedlund, a senior elephant trainer at the
200, who learned of the beatings from two elephant handlers who witnessed
and participated in the abuse. Steve Schwenn, an elephant trainer at the Wild
Animal Park, said that those engaged in the beatings emerged periodically from
the barn complaining of aching arms from the exertion required in administer-
ing the blows. Ragged patches of skin are still visible on Dunda’s head some
five months after the beatings occurred. Schwenn said that he has seen Roocroft
and others beat elephants with ax handles numerous times in his three years
as an employee of the Park.

Although an investigation by the Humane Society of the US. concluded that
Dunda was abused, The San Diego city attorney refused to press charges against
those involved in the beatings, saying that the ”. . .discipline of Dunda, although
seeming harsh to the uninitiated, is a technique accepted in the animal train-
ing profession .” The city attorney’s ofﬁce based its decision on an investigation
by the San Diego Humane Society, which concluded that the beatings ”arose
from a legitimate need to discipline and train a dangerous, four-ton elephant."
The Zoological Society hailed the decision as a ”vindication” of the trainers
involved in the beatings. State Senator Dan McCorquodale (D-San Jose) labeled
the decision not to press charges a ”whitewash," and announced an investiga-
tion by his office into the incident, including a public hearing scheduled for
July 29. Said McCorquodale, ”Average people won’t tolerate an elephant being
tied by four legs, pulled to the ground and beaten.” As a result of the incident,
McCorquodale may introduce legislation to strengthen present anti—cruelty laws
and allow for state oversight of zoo operations. Letters from animal advocates
protesting the beating of Dunda may be sent to: Robert O. Wagner, Executive
Director, American Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, Oglebay
Park, Wheeling, WV 26003; and to: Douglas Myers, Executive Director, San
Diego Zoo, Box 551, San Diego, CA 92112. “x. -

THE ANIMALS' AGENDA - September/October 1988“

lETTERS

A Look at Zoos

As the only international organization
that deals with zoo animals both on a
welfare and conceptual level, I must say
what an excellent article "Chucking Zoo
Animals Overboard" (March 1988) proved
to be and how delighted we are at Zoo
Check that this area of animal abuse has
been drawn so comprehensively to the
attention of your readers.

Zoo Check has been around for four
years now, and has grown from a purely
British domestic pressure group to a truly
international charity which receives com-
plaints from all over the world. We are
currently undertaking a survey of Euro-
pean zoos which we hope will lead to
legislation to establish a minimum stan-
dard of zoo animal welfare across Europe.
We are also establishing contacts in North
America-in Canada through Rob Laid-
law, and in the US. through Dr. Michael
W. Fox. We hope in the not too distant
future to open a contact office in America,
and are glad that we have found like-
minded people who are not willing to sit
back and accept zoo-based propaganda
without questioning the whole concept.

The zoo industry attempts to brainwash
the public by advertising that zoos are
”for the study, appreciation and conser-

vation of wildlife animals.” But zoos are ‘

not saviours of wildlife—they isolate
humans from nature. Depriving wild
animals of their freedom cannot be
justiﬁed either ethically or scientifically
Any so-called conservation efforts are
wasted without parallel efforts to protect
animals’ natural environments. Zoos and
their cohorts in the aquarium industry
have done nothing to raise public aware-
ness of exploitation such as poaching,
smuggling, whaling, and sealing.

In order to end the abuse caused by the
zoo/aquarium industries, we must stop
their expansion. If the money spent on
zoo entertainment was channeled into
conservation in the wild, many of the rare
species would no longer be endangered.
An increase in protected international
parks is essential. The existing prisons
should be shut down and rehabilitation
centers created in order to release the

prisoners into the reserves- -to give them ,

back their freedom.

As an ex-elephant keeper, I would like
to make animal rights activists aware of
a cruel zoo practice. Most of the captive
elephants in the US. are chained by two
legs to their stalls for up to 16 hours every
day. Zoo management will offer various
feeble excuses for all-night chaining, but
essentially it's an old habit that dies hard.
Consider this fact: elephants in the wild
forage for 18 of every 24 hours, requiring
only a few hours of sleep each night. This
fact alone makes it obvious that all-night
chaining is inhumane and unhealthful for
these highly social and intelligent
animals. Also, elephants defecate and
urinate every few hours and, when
chained, are forced to stand in it for many
hours. This leads to skin and food pad
problems. Activists should find out if
their local zoos practice all-night chain-
ing and, if so, write a letter to them and
the local newspaper mentioning the facts
above. They may contact me for more in-
formation. 1 would like to compile a list
of zoos that do not chain elephants, and
would appreciate hearing from those who
take on this project.

The article on zoos was excellent;
however, I would like to make a few com-
ments regarding the Detroit zoo and its

 

director Steve Graham. The article stated
that "public pressure” resulted in the sale
of five snow monkeys to another zoo
rather than for terminal research. But, un-
fortunately, Graham has never been af-
fected by or given in to public pressure
regarding the way in which he runs the
zoo. In 1982, when he decided to destroy
four Siberian tigers, there was a tremen-
dous public outcry—and they were not
the only animals to lose their lives. Under
Graham's tenure, the entire herd of bison
were sent to a slaughterhouse, and five
lions were destroyed along with a Kodiak
bear. In addition to 25 crab-eating maca-
ques sold for terminal research, Graham
donated the entire troop of 34 baboons

.to form the nucleus of a breeding colony

at the Southwest Texas Foundation for
Research and Education. During
Graham’s first 18 months at the 200, 20
birds and mammals were listed as hav-
ing died for reasons unknown. These
ranged from a polar bear and a gorilla
(both found bleeding from the nose and
mouth) to a swan who starved to death
after Graham ordered food withheld.
Although there was tremendous op-
position to Graham’s plans for the snow
monkeys, that opposition would not have
been sufficient to save them. We firmly
believe that had we not filed a lawsuit
against the City of Detriot, the Detroit
City Council, and Steve Graham to block
the sale, those five monkeys would not
be alive today.

Reservations for the tours,

the next two summer and winter

policy will be continued, but plans
have been scotched for a tourist

For through poaching, contagious
diseases, or potentially violent
chance encounters, humans re-
main a threat to the gorillas.

There are more than 600

Despite her criticisms of the Af— . .. ‘
rican Wildlife Foundation, Kml- ,.
ing says neither the poaching— nor
disease-related gorilla deaths can
be blamed on tourism or misman-
agement by Mountain Gorilla Pro-
ject workers in Rwanda. “Every-
one on site is working well togeth-
er,” she said. The gorilla killed by
poaching this summer was an af— 7‘
fectionate adolescent female
named Josie, who made an ap—
pearance in the film. She caught
‘her hand in a poacher's trap, a
snap-up hidden noose used to trap "
forest antelope, and died when the
wound became infected. Project
patrols cut down tens of traps dai- .
ly, but they cannot keep pace with
those who exploit the preserve.

Five gorillas were freed from traps
last month.

Eight gorillas died in a disease
outbreak in March, at least one “as: *T ..
from measles caught from a 'hu- 7- . ‘
man; the others may have died of "
measles-related complications. ‘
Twenty-seven other were innocu-
lated against the disease. ’

These misfortunes notwith‘
standing. the gorilla numbers are
believed to be growing. The last
census, taken in 1986, found 279
gorillas in the park and neighbor-
ing forest in Uganda and Zaire. up
37 from the previous count, in
1981. Nine births this past year,
seven of them male (destabilizing
a delicate balance between sexes)
have offset the losses to disease
and poaching. Between 100—115 go-
rillas were reported farther north
in Uganda’s Impenetrable Forest.
bringing the world mountain go- :
rilla population to about 400.

Keesling, however, is cautious.

“The mountain gorilla might ap- ‘

pear safe for'now, but some unfor-
tunate disease or environmental
disaster could wipe them out at and land

WILDLIFE

Gorillas
doing well
. -. .for n0w

By Don Lessem
Special to the Globe

t the close of “Gorillas in the
Mist,“ the true stars of the
film, the mountain gorillas,
are foraging peacefully for
food. safe and sound in the
highlands of Rwanda. The film's scrolled
epilogue tells us their survival is ensured,
thanks to the efforts of the movie’s hero-
ine, primatologist Dian Fossey.
The image is not all Hollywood hype.
In truth. the gorillas are faring better
than they ever did in Fossey’s years with
them (1967 to 1985), their numbers sur—
passing 400 after having fallen belowe
250 only a decade ago. Hefty fees paid by
the filmmakers for access to the gorillas
have helped finance intensified protective
measures, and concerns that the movie
would result in an unmanageable tourist
inﬂux have not been realized.

. There are frequent reminders, howev-
er. that the future of the gorillas, Earth‘s
largest primate. remains precarious. their
long-term prospects clouded by the en-
croachment of the rapidly growing and
land-needy population of central Africa.
Since summer. five gorillas have inadver-
tently been caught in poachers' game-ani-
mal traps; one died from a trap-inflicted
wound. the first poaching death since
1983. A disease outbreak last February
killed eight gorillas. And there is a grow-
ing rivalry among US conservation groups
that are supposed to cooperate in protect-

 

ing the gorillas’ principal habitat. Rwan-

da‘s l45-square-mi1e Parc des Volcans.

The mountain gorilla is the largest and '

most endangered of the great apes; the
adult males often reach six feet in height
and weigh 375 pounds or more.

in 1960. George Schaller of the New '

York Zoological Society. the first scientist

to study the species at length, esti-
mated the mountain gorilla popu-
lation at between 400 and 500, all
in an area straddling the border of
Uganda, Rwanda and Zaire. With—
in a short time after the park 5
lower half gave way to cultivation
' in 1967, nearly half had died,
from poaching- and crowding-re-
lated causes. . . g p
More than a dozen were lost to
poachers during Fossey's nearly
129” years in Rwanda. The, popula-

 

ungas region in the late 19705.

‘ Fossey blamed the underfund—
ed Rwandan government for fail-
ing to protect the gorillas and set
out to establish her own vigilante
anti—poaching patrols. They were
financed by contributions to her

 

nonprofit Digit Fund - named for
a favorite adolescent male gorilla.
killed by poachers in 1977.

Her efforts brought her into
conflict with the Mountain Gorilla
Project, an international consor-
tium of conservation agencies es-
tablished by the government in
1978 to supervise conservation

:, programs. Fossey accused the con-
sortium, led by the Washington-
. based African Wildlife Founda—
tion, of fostering profiteering by
allowing tourists to view the
park’s gorillas.

After Fossey’s death, the execu-
tors of the Digit Fund transferred
the small organization and its

$30,000 in assets to the Morris _

Animal Foundation, a nonprofit
sponsor of veterinary care fi-
nanced by the makers of a pet
food supplement (but no relation-
‘ship to Morris the Cat). As Morris
foundation trustee Ruth E. Keesl—
ing recalled, “Fossey pleaded with
us to send a veterinarian to live
. and work at the park. She was
I convinced the gorillas were all go-
ing to die and no one knew any-
thing physiologically about what
the remaining ones needed to keep
them alive as long as possible.”

The Morris group answered the

plea, working With the Rwandan"
government through the sponsor—
ship of "the African Wildlife Foun-
dation’s Mountain Gorilla Project.
But the marriage of the two
groups has not been a happy one.

Keesling, the Digit Fund’s new
president, said in a telephone in-
terview there is an “unnecessary
competitiveness between conser—
vation groups fostered by African-
Wildlife Foundation administra-
tors. Historically, they are part of
the raping of Dian Fossey, captita-
lizing on her efforts for their own
purposes." .

African Wildlife Foundation
vice president Diana E. McMeekin
responded, saying the Morris
- group is “uncomfortable being un-
der the same umbrella as us.”

To that, Keesling responds,
“The Morris Foundation is no
longer affiliated with the Moun-
tain Gorilla Project." Keesling
leaves for Rwanda this week to
forge an agreement to continue
the Kinagi veterinary center es-
tablished just outside the park in

January. She said the foundation "

{tion fell to a low of 231 in the Vir—W

hopes to add a museum, dedicated
to Fossey, “for all those people
who can‘t get up the mountain” to
see the gorillas.

Both foundations are plagued
by money problems.

Donations poured in to the
Morris after Fossey died, Keesling
said, but “dropped off quickly.‘
The group provides $65,000 a year
to sustain the Karisoke camp.
Contributions will not sustain the
center, let alone finance the more
than $100,000 in overdue capital
improvements, Keesling said.

Universal and Warner studios,
which teamed to make the movie,
gave each foundation more than
$100,000 from premiere perfor—
mances of the film, and 500 the-
aters are soliciting contributions
from movie patrons. Actress Si—
gourney Weaver, who portrayed
Fossey, announced last week a
program under which donors can
“adopt" a Rwandan gorilla ,for
$1,000 to $10,000.

The African Wildlife Founda—

tion pays 96 percent of the Moun—
tain Gorilla Project’s $250,000 an—
nual budget, and this year most of
that money came from “Gorillas
in the Mist.” The producers paid a
hefty six-figure fee (neither side
will disclose the exact amount) to
the Project, and a far larger fee to
the Rwandan government.Project
money, among other things, pays
for the Rwandan anti-poaching
patrols and for supervision of the
gorillas.

Most of the gorillas know noth-

ing of F ossey, Sigourney Weaver,
or any Westerners; the Project
tries to keep them free of human
contact. Though Fossey’s access
was limited only by her endur-
ance, since her death efforts have
been made to ensure that only 105
gorillas in seven human-habituat—
ed groups are under the looking-
glass of humans.

Three groups are under study
at the Karisoke camp where Fos-
sey worked. Scientists are collect—
ing basic behavioral data, and
performing more esoteric work —-
such as studies on buffaloes’ im- .
pact on the gorilla feeding grounds

and tracing the gorillas’ ancestry

by the-DNA in their hair follicles.
Elsewhere on the lower slopes

gof the mountainous park, four
, other gorilla groups are monitored
:by the Mountain Gorilla Project

and are visited by Project-led
tours. The number of tourists is
limited to 24 per day, and each

: pays a fee, recently doubled to
‘ $152 a day, to get a glimpse of the
‘animals. For that glimpse, no
. longer than 90 minutes, they slog
l through nettles along steep in—
? clines for up to six hours.

How to Handle
an Elephant

Zoos and animal abuse

 

ven in captivity, 0 Best Beloved, ele-

phants never forget that the game of

life is all about dominance. Naturally,
they like to be the boss. But to care properly
for the ponderous pachyderms, keepers
and handlers must be in charge. Tradition-
ally, taming the beasts has meant inﬂicting
acertain amount ofphysical pain. "How do
you get a 10,000-pound elephant’s atten-
tion? Irlit him, that’s how,” asserts Saul
Kitchener, director of the San Francisco
Zoological Gardens. In the past few
months, a trumpeting chorus of animal
partisans, including some zoo workers, has
charged that the elephant men and women
have gone too far with their disciplinary
techniques. In some cases, they say, han-
dlers have beaten the animals severely. ”In
the zoo world now,” says San Francisco
keeper Connie Channon, "this is a hot is-
sue. Everyone is re—examining how you
handle the elephants.”

The 400 or so elephants in North Ameri-
can zoos, wild animal parks and circuses are
there not merely for the enjoyment of bi-
peds. The survival of their species may soon
depend partly on human-engineered breed-
ing. But an elephant is unlike
other zoo animals, explains Jeff
J ouett, a spokesman for the San
Diego Zoo, “because it needs
very intimate contact with its
keeper.” For instance, zoo ele-

gressive behavior, had been dis-
ciplined with the sharp end of a
hooked stick called an ankus.
Other keepers claim the 200’s
Asian elephants are routinely
beaten with the two-foot wood-
en handle of the stick as part of
a behavior modification pro-
gram. But last week a team of
elephant experts summoned by
Kitchener concluded that no
abuse had taken place.

Some zoos have found less
physically aggressive methods
to control elephants. One pure-
ly practical technique, used at
Washington Park Zoo in Port-
land, Ore., is the "crush” or
“squeeze”: two hydraulically
powered parallel walls that im-

 

 

Who' 5 the boss? Tin herbelle and her trainer Channon

chained her, forced her to kneel and beat
her repeatedly about the head with thick
hickory sticks. Zoological Society olIicials
maintain that the beatings were an appro-
priate way to discipline a dangerous ani-
mal. They claim Dunda had attacked han—
dlers in the past and resisted efforts to care
for her. "Dunda is 100 percent better than
she was at the zoo,” says J ouett. “The ends
seem to justify the means.” The Humane
Society of the United States, however, has
called the episode a clear case of abuse.
The latest allegations of maltreatment
surfaced last month at the San Francis-
co Zoo. A keeper charged thatTinkerbelle, a
7,000—pound Asian cow known for her ag-

mobilize the animals in a stand-
ing position. For behavior modi-
fication, Portland vet Michael
Schmidt avoids physical force unless abso—
lutely necessary. "Being far more intelli-
gent” than the elephant, he says, "you have
other means at your disposal.” Schmidt fa-
vors a system of positive reinforcement and
trainers who know how to relate to animals.
But even folks who ﬁght on behalf of ani-
mals sometimes act like dumb beasts. Last
month the homes and cars of three keepers
allegedly involved in beating Dunda were
vandalized, with damages estimated at
$30, 000. Members of a radical animal-
rights group are thought to be responsible.
It’s a real jungle out there.

phants require close human at-
tention to their feet, which in
captivity are susceptible to life-
threatening infections. Wild el-
ephants walk about 20 miles a
day, which wears down their
footpads and toenails. In con-
ﬁnement, they need frequent
pachydermal pedicures to stay
healthy.

Because handlers get up
close and personal with the ele-
phants, they must instill obedi—
ence and eliminate dangerous
.and unpredictable behavior.
But just how much force and
pain are necessary? Earlier
this year Dunda, an 18-year- -old
African cow, was transferred

so biologists thought. Now
the assumption that life is
impossible below the tips
of plant roots has been ex-
ploded: researchers from ﬁve
universities and the Depart-
ment of Energy have found
3,000 species of microor-

The bugs were found in
four holes, only three to six
inches across, dug with new
"aseptic” techniques that
keep contaminants out. Most
of the microbes breathe the
oxygen given off by under-
ground water; the others
don’t need oxygen to live. Be-
cause of the paucity of nutri-
ents, the bugs generally have
very slow metabolisms, simi-
lar to hibernation. The big-
gest mystery is how they ﬁrst
found their subterranean
home. One theory is that they
wormed their way down or
were carried by rainwater
from the surface; alternative-
ly, they might have lived

 

their origin,
some of the organisms may be
destined for glory. Pharma-
ceutical houses will screen
the bugs for antibiotic and
other medicinal properties.
Microbiologists are hoping to
ﬁnd more bugs, like the two _
already isolated species that
break down poisonous tri-
chloroethylene (TOE) into
harmless water and carbon
dioxide. They might help
clean up polluted wells and
aquifers around the coun-
try. Next year scientists
will launch probes in Idaho
and Washington, h0ping to
extend even deeper man’s
knowledge of the teeming

Everyone ’8 Invited to Party *
For Zoo Atlanta is ‘Starlet’

By Michelle Hiskey
Staff Writer

It’s not easy facing wrinkles
this early in life, especially ones that
bag at the ankles like cheap panty-
hose. She may live to 60 and she’s
only one-tenth of the way there.

Such is life for a 2,300 pound
child star.

Starlet O’Hara, the Shirley
Temple of Zoo Atlanta’s daily ele-
phant shows and a fixture atAt-
lanta parades, turns 6 on Saturday,
and the public is invited to a party
for the performing pachyderm from 1
to 5 pm.

Starting at 10 am, her fans
can sign an elephantine birthday
card, to be presented along with
the cake after she performs at 1 pm.
She’ll pose for pictures, and he;
handlers will field questions J

the world’s largest, andone of i3

most intelligent, land animals.

If it rains, the festivities will
be held Sunday.

Elephants mature at about the
same rate as humans, and the 6—foot
Miss O’Hara is expected to grow to
nine feet and weigh five tons by her
early 20s She’s been gaining
about 700 pounds a year on a daily
diet of 70 pounds ofhay and a 7—
pound “vitamin” of alfalfa and corn,
said her handler, Jim M. Black.

“I’ll be in a wheelchair when
she’s still in her prime,” he joked.

Her cake -— carrot flavored,
her favorite —- will be quite an ele-
phant treat, although it won’t be
topped with candles. Instead, six car-
rots will protrude from the top.

40,000 muscles, can pick up a peanut

Her barn mates, Victoria and Zam-

Honorable George Bush
President-Elect

The White House
Washington, DC 20520

Dear Mr. Bush:

My husband and I both voted for you - but - that was before
I read the enclosed story in the Dallas Times Herald on
November 15.

If this is a true story, then I must admit I am sorry I cast
my vote in your direction. Everyone knows what an abyssmal
record the current administration has when it comes to pro-
tecting the environment and our wildlife. I don't think there
has ever been a less-caring president in the White House.

Of course, I realize that President Reagan has a lot of friends
in the west, and I am sure he has been greatly influenced by
their wishes and opinions. He should have been listening to
the majority of American citizens.

It is my earnest hope that if the enclosed is true, you will
have a complete about-face as far as our air, water and wild-
life is concerned - and our forests, National Parks and our
Wildlife Refuges.

According to the dictionary, “REFUGE" means a place Where some-
one can go for protection, and since our Wildlife Refuges are
to protect our wildlife, I hope and trust you will use your in-
fluence to see that the wild life within their borders is pro-
tected and not opened to hunting and trapping.

That mankind should take such great delight in hunting down and
killing a beautiful animal, or an ugly animal, is one of the

great phenomenons of our history. Perhaps if we weren't so blood-
thirsty when it comes to hunting, we might have more respect for
mankind.

Sincerely,

:us envuonmen a
record 1s shameful

By Bob Eckhardt
SPECIAL TO THE mes HERALD

 

EORGE BUSH HAS NOW
proclaimed himself an envi-
ronmentalist. There has been
no indication in the whole of
his political career that he ever
joined in passing an environ-
mental achievement when he
was in Congress or fostered any
environmental action in the ex-
ecutive department. On the
contrary, Bush did about every-
thing in his power to stymie the
development of federal statuto-
ry environmental protection.
The four years in which he
served in the House of Repre-
sentatives were so devoid of
Bush’s activities in the environ-
mental ﬁeld that Michael Weis—
skopf, writing in “The Cam-
paign of 1988” in the
Washington Post, could not
identify any of them except in
two small instances: Bush had
prevented a bayou in Houston
from being channelized, and he
had introduced a Big Thicket
National Park bill, which never
materialized during his term in
ofﬁce.

An erroneous statement in a
publication of the Sierra Club
mentions Bush and suggests
there had been a “park acquisi-
tion.” This did not occur until I,
along with Rep. Charles 'Wilson
in the House and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen in the Senate, passed
the Big Thicket Preserve in
1973 more than two years after
-Bush had left Congress.

The same publication pro-
claimed Bush as having “led
the ﬁght for the .Big Thicket
National Park.” Texas Sierra
Club members who joined in
the ﬁght for the Big Thicket
wOuld be appalled at the twist-
ing of the truth in the report of
the national organization. For
Texas environmentalists, Sen.
Ralph Yarborough had been the
acknowledged “Father of the
Big Thicket Preserve.”

Yarborough had led the ﬁght
in his Senate Bill 3929 in 1966
before Bush had entered Con-
gress. In the next term, in the
90th Congress, Yarborough of-
fered Senate Bill 4, moving it
out of the Senate committee to

the ﬂoor. Dining that term,.

Rep. James Wright carried it, as
HR 11188, in the House. Cer-
tainly, Bush did not lead the
ﬁght. He only introduced HR
18498, on July 16, 1970, and
nothing happened until in 1973,
the Wilson-Eckhardt bill,- HR
11546-7, with 39 House mem-
bers, passed it.

Through a period around the
19703, we saw development of a
body of environmental law un-
matched in any decade in the
nation’s history. Bush had very
little to do with it. He served
only two terms in Congress,
and his position in committee
service did not involve either
the Interior or the Commerce
committees, where most of the
action had occurred. Bush left
the Congress after his second
term and moved on to the posi-
tion of ambassador to the Unit-
ed Nations and, in about 10
months, to the directorship of
the CIA. . .

Meanwhile, Congress was
deeply concerned with the en-
vironment as Bush was clim-
bing the ladder of appointive
ofﬁcial position. During that
time in Congress the six pillars
in the structure of federal statu-
tory environmental protection
were erected:

I Abatement of water pollu-
tion.

I Improvement of air quality.

I Establishment of a safe
workplace. . ,

I Prevention of the selling of
dangerous consumer products.

I Prohibition of toxic sub-
stances.

IElimination of hazardous
waste disposal. ‘

But when that salubrious ac—
tion occurred after 1981, Bush

as vice president began to tear ‘

down that structure of environ-
mental protection. At that time,
he set up a “task force” to de-
regulate the necessary enforce-
ment agencies for pollution
abatement, industrial safety,
regulation of dangerous con-
sumer products and elimination
of hazardous waste and toxic
substances. ‘

The Regulatory Task Force
was a signal to the business
community that the vice presi-

1,", 1 it
is at! .

 

Vice president helped dismantle pro-

tective measures.

 

dent was determined to reduce
regulation to an absolute mini-
mum. This philosophy sent the
message to all civil servants
that the task force was militant-
ly hostile to honest and impar—
tial policing of environmental
protection.

For instance, on April 10,
1981, Boyden Gray, counsel to
the vice president’s task force.
in a speech before the 1.7.8
Chamber of Commerce, said:

“. . .the people (at the agency ,,
were not being completely can-
did with their own top people
(that is, the political heads of
the agency). We told the law-
yers representing the individual
companies and the trade associ-
ation involved to come back to
us if they had a problem...
They said they did, and we
made a couple of phone calls
and straightened it out, alerted
the top people at the agency
that there was a little hanky-
panky going on at the bottom
of the agency, and it was
cleared up very rapidly. So the
system does work if you use it
as a sort of appeal.”

Presumably by inducing a lit—
tle hanky-panky at the top of
the agency.

Law and custom place ethical
and legal restrictions upon ap-
proaches to an agency by those
who have a matter pending be-
fore it, but restrictions do not
exist respecting approaches
made by the Regulatory Task
Force. Congress imposes rules
and regulations which should
be enforced by the agency of
government itself. Under the

[Administrative Procedure Act,
iya record must be kept of every-
;thing that goes into -a formal
lproceeding which results in a
grule. Statutes are intended to
{control the agencies through
? law, not decontro] them by fiat.

In 1981 and 1982, Bush ac—
tively directed his Task Force
on Regulatory Relief, defining
at least 15 interventions in
health, safety and environmen-
tal protection regulations in six
departments and agencies.

It was in the 1981-82 election
cycle that the Republican Na-
tional Committee and its Re-
publican Senate adjuncts raised
$180.4 million, compared to
$28.5 million by their Demo-
cratic counterparts. The access
that the task force gave in that
period enabled a great amount
of money to be funneled into
Republican coffers.

The whole program of dis-
mantling environmental protec-
tion has continued, with Bush
as a major factor.

His claim to be an environ-
mentalist is a cynical fraud.
Even his claim, by implication,
that he caused preservation of
the Big Thicket is a deception.
But it cannot be claimed that
he is a “wimp.” He set afoot a
powerful movement to disman-
;tle the protection of the envi-
Eronment, and we now see the
{effect —— the greenhouse syn-
idrome, acid rain and hazardous
lwaste in land and sea. Because
?of neglect of the environment it
.will ultimately cost trillions of
dollars to correct it.

San Antonio

With as many as 45,000
visitors in a single day, Sea
World of 1%:an must be
ready for just about any-
thing to happen — includ-
ing a birth.

But when the mother-
to-be weighs 6,500 pounds
and the awaited bundle of
joy is expected to out-bulk
the average NFL lineman,
extraordinary measures
are called for.

So with Sea World here
awaiting the arrival of a
baby killer whale, no aver~
age maternity ward will
do: Give the expectant

A pregnant pause in San Antonio
Killer-whale births help spotlight sea mammals’ plight

rubdowns, and all—you"-
can—eat salmon, mackerel,
and squid - about 200
pounds a day.

In addition, she’s under
24-hour surveillance, with
doting attendants taking
daily measurements of the
mother-to-be’s expanding
girth.

With few captive births
of the black-and—white
killer whales on the books,
Sea World ofﬁcials here
say they are adding to
what is known about ma-
rine mammal propagation.
Recently Sea World’s ﬁfth
killer—whale birth took
place before a rapt audi-
ence at its park in Orlando,
Fla, another was born ear-

lier this. year in San Diego.‘

“The kiiie: whale is nor

an endangered species, but
if we don’t know some-
thing about the animal be
fore that point, it may be
too late,” says Glenn
Young, general curator of
animal science at Sea
World in San Antonio; “1
hope what we do results in
a better understanding
and appreciation for not
only killer whales speciﬁ-
cally, but all animals.”
There is little question
that the killer whale
Kandu’s pregnancy is
causing a stir in San Anto

names for the baby.

Coming to term, as the San
Antonio pregnancy does, on
the heels of the hugely publi-
cized rescue of two trapped
gray whales off the northern
Alaska coast, the interest is
only heightened.

But for some environmen-
talists, there is growing con-
cern that the attention heaped
on individual animals and
their predicaments may serve
to deﬂect needed public
awareness and action from
larger issues of species
endangerment.

They note, for example,
that millions of dollars ~ and
valuable nightly TV exposure
— were lavished on the
trapped gray whales, while
whales are still being hunted
down by some nations.

At the same time tens of
thousands of dolphins, who
have the misfortune of serving
as a draw to schools of tuna,
continue to be sought out by
tuna ﬁshermen as a guide to
their catches, and then slaugh-
tered along with the tuna in
the nets. Little is said in the
press about it.

And now along the Florida
coasts a new danger faces
sharks, whose ﬁns are valued
for soup, as trophies, and as a
supposed aphrodisiac. With
the shark meat fetching con—
‘ siderably less money than the
ﬁn itself, ﬁshermen aren’t
bothering with the whole ﬁsh:
The ﬁns are cut off and the
sharks are dumped back in the
water to die.

“We’ve held 130 demon-

 

strations so far this year” to '

protest Iceland’s continued
whaling under a loophole in
International Whaling Com-
mission regulations, “but not
once have we gotten any real
national press out of it,” says

 

._. 5'

 

Campbell Plowden, whale
campaign coordinator for
Greenpeace, the international
environmental organization.
“Then two whales get trapped
up in Alaska, and overnight
I’m on ‘Good Morning Amer-
ica’ and CNN.”

Mr. Plowden says the hu-
man compassion expressed
OVer the plight of the whales
in Alaska and the exposure to
sea animals allowed by some-
thing like a killer~whale birth
probably work in favor of or-
ganizations like his. “Our mail
is up more than four times
since the whale incident,” he
says. But he adds that in his
view the public interest can
come at a price.

“If public awareness is gen
erated by people seeing a killer
whale giving birth, that’s
good,” Plowden says. “But
that doesn’t necessarily over-
come what we see as the down
side” of keeping the animals in
captivity.

Plowden says his organiza-
tion generally opposes keeping
cetaceans, or marine mam-
mals, in captivity: in part be-
cause there is some evidence
they don’t do well there, he
says, and also because the cap-

matic” for the animals.

“A benchmark of how a
species is doing in captivity is
whether it is willing and able
to reproduce,” Plowden said,
noting that few killer whales
have had successful captive
births.

Sea World’s Mr. Young says
the small but growing number
of successful killer-whale
births counters that argument.
He adds that, while he does
not believe the capturing of
live specimens is “terribly
traumatic,” one of Sea World’s

goals is to reach the point ..
where births of killer-whales '

already in captivity.end any
need for captures.

The beneﬁts those captures
have made possible — public
identiﬁcation with marine
mammals, education pro—
grams on species survival and
environmental threats — “far
outweigh the negative side,”

. he says.

“Certainly there’s a differ-
ence between Sea World ex-
hibiting Bottlenose dolphins
for everyone’s enjoyment and
education,” says Young, “as
opposed to ﬁshermen drown-
ing them in their nets.”

Jungle to Desert

House Painter Operates Gibbon '

~ Study Center in Santa Clarita Area

By T. W. MCCARRY, Times Staff Writer

t sunrise each day, Alan Mootnick’s chorus greets the dawn
with a yammering of wild hoots, ﬁlling the desert north of
Santa Clarita with the exotic cacophony of an Asian jungle.
Mootnick runs the Gibbon and Gallinaceous Bird Center,
home to up to two dozen gibbons, the small apes that
claim—loudly—the title of noisiest land mammals on earth.

’ For 10 years Mootnick, a construction worker and house painter, has
used his own money to run the center because he thinks gibbons are
fascinating. It costs him about $30,000 a year, he said.

He is applying to California and federal tax authorities for

 

It's quite difficult for someone who hasn’t gone through formal training
to be able to write a paper . . . and get it published in a journal that IS

, professor at American University
in Washington. .
Richard Tenaza, a biology pro-
femor at the University of the
Pacific in Stockton who is usually
named by primate researchers as
one of the handful of gibbon ex-
penis in the country, said he was
surprised to learn that Mootnick
. had no formal education in the

‘Dedication . . . Determination‘

'hxonomy includes classifying
individual animals as members of
one-of the nine species of gibbons,
an many subspecies, which often
loo alike, a problem that is com—
pOLiided by interbreeding of spe—

, cies in zoos. When other biologists
an zoo administrators are stumped
in hassifying a gibbon, Tenaza said,

they send for Mootnick to render
‘ ent.

“Alan is the epitome of the kind

_ of person who teaches himself
through dedication and determina-
tion," said Rick Barongi, curator 0f
mammals at the San Diego Zoo.

“1 can call Alan on the phone and
play a recording of a gibbon s
vocalization, and he can tell me

cies, it belongs to. Only one other

recognition of the center as an educational institution. With

tax-deductible status, he said, he hopes to attract grants that will allow

him to give up construction work, concentrate on writing research
papers, and perhaps move his
gibbons to a new home
somewhere with a milder
climate, like Ventura.

Scholars from American and
foreign universities visit the
center to observe the gibbons.
Mootnick has published 10
research papers in Scholarly
journals such as the American
Journal of Primatology, Cell
Genetics and Cytogenetics and
works of the American Assn. of
Zoological Parks and
Aquariums. .

His own formal education, ,
however, consists of a diploma

from Birmingham High School

and a two-year dental

researcher in the country can do
that. And he has a PhD. and works
at the Smithsonian,” Barongi said.

Although they are cute and their
ability as natural acrobats makes
them a delight to watch, life as a
pet is psychologically harmful to
gibbons, he said They identify too
closely with humans, lose their
identity as gibbons and become
confused.

Mootnick lives in a former ma-
chine shop on 5 acres in a remote
area north of the city. He keeps _14
gibbons in tall cages equipped with
ropes, trapezes and perches to give
them leaping points. The popula-
tion has fluctuated from a low of
seven to a high of 27.

bons when he lived in North Holly -
wood in 1971. He founded the

I’m sick of this negative hogwash
circulating about the cost and eth-
ics of the whale rescue. Yes, it was
worth every cent to save the two
great grays—for our own sake as
well as the animals’. When we as
humans can learn to value animal
life, there might be a fragment of
hope that we can stop the environ-
mental destruction of our earth
home and have some compassion
for our fellow humans who are
endangered as well under many
circumstances.

The rescue was a shining exam-
ple of the problems we can solve
working together internationally
with effort and good will to prevent
tragedy. Thank the powers that be
that we can at least save two
whales, if not millions of homeless
pets, hungry people and abused
children.

Remd offered in case
of coug that vanished

By DEL MARTH
Tribune Correspondent

. LAKE CITY — A $2,000 reward
was offered Thursday to help state
wildlife officials find out how a Tex-
as cougar died in North Florida.
2‘ A radio collar attached to the
male cougar was found Oct. 17 in a
private pond about 25 miles south of
the Georgia line. Officials believe
the cougar was killed, but its body
has not been found.

The animal was one of five cou-
gars transplanted from Texas into

‘ the Osceola National Forest in June

to see if the cougars’ close cousins,
the endangered Florida panther,
could be successfully introduced in-
to rural North Florida.

“The reward is private money,
put up by the reward branch of the
Wildlife Alert,” said Dewey Weaver
of the Florida Game and Fresh Wa-
ter Fish Commission. The commis-
sion created Wildlife Alert, a
private group concerned with pro-
tecting the state’s wildlife.

“Because the cougar’s radio col-
lar was cut, and apparently thrown
into a pond, we suspect foul play,”
said Dennis Jordan, who is helping
coordinate the cougar/panther
transplant program for the US. Fish

,. and Wildlife Service.

In July, a female cougar also

 

transplanted from Texas was found
dead in the Suwannee River. The
cause of death never was deter-
mined, Jordan said. ° ‘

“Our best guess is she may have
gotten into some poison,” he said.

Left are one male and two fe-
males, each with radio collars so
wildlife researchers can determine
their whereabouts during weekly
ﬂights over the region.

Collar signals from a fixed loca-
tion alert researchers to possible
trouble. Jordan said the cougar was
moving and apparently well on Oct.
15. But two days later its signal was
fixed and coming from the pond.

Jordan said that since the cou-
gars’ arrival in Florida they have
shown normal movement and suc-
cessfully found food.

Jordan said the next step is to
introduce into North Florida “four
or five captive-raised cats that are
brought up in a way that would help
them adapt to the wild.”

Should they adapt to North Flor-
ida, some of the estimated 50 sur-
viving but endangered Florida
panthers from the Everglades area
could be moved into the Osceola
forest.

“Before we make any such
move we must be sure,” Jordan
said. “We have too few panthers to

,_ risk any of them.”

Heroic Efforts to Save the Whales Stuck in the Arctic Ice

What a great front-page photo—
graph (by Associated Press, Oct.
27) of the Eskimo touching, and
bidding bon voyage to, one of the
two rescued California gray
whales. Dr. Doolittle was not crazy!
That such an adventure could af-
fect and involve so many people
from different nations and walks of
life is a testament to the majority of
humankind’s deep compassion and
sense of right.

I agree with Carolyn See
(“Lured to the Whales When It’s
' So Hard to Rescue People in Need,”
Op-Ed Page, Oct. 28) that our
homeless people are far too neg-
lected, but humans have greater
control of their own destiny than
do the animals of whom we are
caretakers.

Granted, many families and indi-
viduals are victims of bad luck, and
they need our. help. But Homo
sapiens are not endangered, as are
the gray whales and hundreds of
other creatures. There is a preva-
lent vanity in our way of thinking
that, because humans are the sup-
posed supreme mammal, we are the
most important living organism on
earth. Actually, we are just another
link in the chain, humbling as that
fact may be.

I wish that Bone, the third whale,
had been able to keep up the fight.
As the two survivors swim, bearing
a flag of global good will, let Bone’s
death be a reminder of how far we
have to go in saving the animals,
the earth, and our homeless.

I was a member of the first
Greenpeace Anti-Whaling Expedi-
tion in 1975—in fact, I was the only
American to complete the 64-day
expedition. It has been lauded over
the years as the first truly interna-
tional “eco-action,” the one that
brought environmentalism into the
mainstream.

We tracked the Soviet whaling
fleet for 500 miles in the northeast

Pacific, managing to prevent them -

from killing many endangered
sperm whales. I had to bear the
sight of them harpooning whales
before our eyes, resisting the temp-
tation to brand the Whalers-hap-
less workers as they were—as
evil-hearted men.

 

Now I hear people condemning
the effort of Soviet icebreakers that
saved the two gray whales off
Point Barrow as a cynical gesture.
It may have been a public relations
move on their part, and perhaps'a
bit cynical and sensationalist in
light of their whaling record.

But we are a species of image
lovers, greatly affected by what is
shown us in our media. If our act of
sending men to the moon was also
sensationalist, criticized by many
who felt it was too costly in light of
our social needs here on earth, still
the images of our planet as viewed
from the moon remain a major
turning point in human conscious-
ness.

It is this perspective, the sight of
Soviet ships flying the American
flag in this effort to save two

‘ helpless cetaceans, that will prevail

in our minds and hearts, and will '

remain as a symbol of our common
destiny as human beings. I applaud
the Soviets for their decision to

I‘ help.

WILLIAM E. JACKSON

Regarding the letters of Oct. 31
protesting the saving of the whales
off Point Barrow, the writers are
guilty of the fault of oversimplifi-
cation of what are complex world
problems. The attitude that two
whales are expendable refutes the
Claim that the writers really care
about the starving people in Africa
and elsewhere.

Would someone let their pet cat
or dog suffer and die because its
rescue cost too much? The sympa-
thy extended toward those intelli—
gent, helpless whales brought Es-
kimo, American and Russian
together in a noble effort. Maybe
the solving of the world’s over-
whelming problems could start
with this kind of cooperation. '

It was heartwarming in the same
edition to read how the schoolchil-
dren wanted to help and tried to
show their gratitude. Compassion'

begins at home and the earlier the
better.

Would the above writers pro- '

testing that nature should take its
course apply that philosophy to all
inhabitants of this planet? Or,

would they be willingto go without .-

a few meals to share with the '

needy?
MARY BERNARDINE
FOSTER
Escondido

Regarding criticism of the effort
that went into rescuing those
trapped whales while people are
hungry and homeless: I don’t like to
see people suffering any more than
anyone else, but why do we contin-
ue to assume that our problems and
our welfare are somehow more
important than any other creatures

on this earth?

If the concern manifested in
saving those whales was multiplied

' by one tenth of a percent on a

general basis, our planet wouldn’t
be in the unholy mess it’s in now.

O
The plight of three whales

: trapped in ice held the world

spellbound. The outcry was unbe-
lievable. In the animal world, each

, day billions of God’s creatures, by
‘ nature, die because of exposure,

hunger, larger prey, or man. ~\ .
In the human world, each day
millions of innocent babies, not

, animals, formed in the image and
, likeness of God are eliminated by
g the “garbage grinder of conven-
j ience” and hardly a protest is
’ heard.

When the history of this world is

written, and it will be, we will find
1 that all of man’s inhumanity to
1 man, from the gulags of Russia to

the ovens of Auschwitz, will pale

’- compared to what we see every day
': in our lives and hardly a cry is
{ heard or a tear shed.

Like many others, I was caught .

. up in the drama of freeing the
. whales. Why is it that a nation’s

sympathy can be mobilized to ac-
complish this task, while we live
with 35,000 children dying daily?
Could it be that helping the whales
seems possible to us, while provid-
ing health and well-being for suf-
fering children seems like some-
thing we are doomed to fail at?

'In reality, we do have the oppor-

As winter coat season
begins, celebrities are
spreading the word that
furs give them the chills.

From ﬂirtatious Golden
Girl Rue McClanahan to
freaky horror hostess El-
vira, stars are aligning
themselves with animal
rights groups:

> People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals’
new campaign —— “Cruelty
is never chic. Don’t wear
fur” — is endorsed by
McClanahan. PETA plans
a “Rock Against Fur” con-
cert in New York Feb. 18,
with the B-525 and Elvira
as mistress of ceremonies.

b The Humane Society
of the United States has
plastered posters pro-
claiming “You Should Be

Ashamed to Wear Fur” all

over major cities. Its new
spokeswoman is Dutch
model Jolanda Boot, who
passes up $3,000 assign-
ments because she refuses
to wear fur.

b Trans-Species Unlim-
ited sponsors its third an-
nual Fur Free Friday Nov.
25. Bob Barker leads a
New York march, with co-
ordinated events across
the USA.

Anti-fur activists say
their message is ﬁnally
reaching the public. Last
year, after 12 years of ris-

ing sales, fur sales re-
mained ﬂat. “The fur in-
dustry will say it’s because
of the stock market crash,
but we think otherwise,”
says Trans-Species presi-
dent George Cave.
Furriers, however, ex-
.pect ’88 sales to increase
from $1.8 billion to $2 bil-
lion. “We’re behind the
most humane ways of
trapping,” says American
Fur Industry executive
Sandy Blye. “The anti-fur

' activists are using more

visible means to get their
message across. But the
bottom line is demand is
high. Consumers want to
wear fur.”

Unreporied cruelty

It was with much frustratiOn that I
followed the story of the poor crow that was
inadvertently destroyed by volunteers at the
édoibe Mountain Wildlife Rehabilitation

en er.

The public outcry and sadness at the death
of this unfortunate creature was amazing.
This is the same public that remains silent as
thousands of he] less animals are caught in
vicious steel leg-gold traps to satisfy some
people’s cruel sense of fashion. Coyotes,
bobcats, raccoons, and unintentional victims
such as eagles, crows, hawks and even
domestic pets are horribly tortured and
destroyed by trappers. Where’s the outcry for
all these animals? The hypocrisy is
unbelievable!

I would hope that all who felt such .
indignation at the death of a crow would turn
their energy to saving thousands of other
creatures who are dying a far worse death.
The anger they felt toward the Adobe Center
should be directed at the trappers and fur
industry. People who truly care will boycott
all fur products and stores that sell furs.
They will spread the message that people
should be ashamed to wear fur and let-
managers of department stores know that if
they want their patronage they will not sell-
fur products.

It is time for this most compassionate of
nations to realize that cruelty should never
be tolerated under any circumstances and
that the time has come to put the fur
industry out of business.

ATLANTA JOURNAL — December 29, 1988

Crackdown on ‘Sportsmen’ Should Be Applauded

WASHINGTON - ()n a cool day in January
1988, professional guides associated with a
shooting resort near Sabine Pass, Texas, ar-
ranged a goose hunt. Their $600-a-day clients
were three good ol’ boys named Standish, Kuncir
and Patterson. Unknown to the guides, the three
were special agents of the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service. They had a bloody good time.

On Jan. 22, firing three separate volleys, the
group killed 204 geese. The next day, in two vol-
leys, the group shot 176 geese. Says the govern-
ment, laconically, “This was in excess of the dai-
ly bag limit.” '

The charges are contained in the govern-
ment’s own volley of indictments and criminal
informations against roughly 200 individuals and
guide services. The accusations, made public on
Dec. 13, climaxed a three—year undercover oper-
ation in Texas. If convicted, the defendants face
fines ranging up to $250,000 and imprisonment
up to five years. Twenty—seven of the defendants
will go to court on felony charges.

.True‘ sportsmen and conservationists will
hail the investigation with applause. The govern-
ment must prove its case, of Course, but the very

act of filing charges should have a strong deter-
rent effect against hunters and guides who scoff
at laws protecting migratory birds.

Under the law, ducks and geese may be tak~
en only in season and are subject to limits; but,
the defendants in these cases are charged with
ignoring the end of season and with ﬂouting the
limits. The law lays down rules on tagging; the
law requires hunters to try to retrieve crippled
birds; the law prohibits electronic callers; the
law bans baiting; the law restricts the sale of
ducks and geese. The government charges that
all these laws were violated wholesale in Texas.

A common theme runs through the indict—
ments —— utter contempt for the law. One guide is
charged with encouraging clients to ignore bag
limits. “Just keep shooting,” he told them. Anoth-
er guide boasted that he had purchased a ton of
wheat as bait. Other guides used airboats to herd
ﬂocks of ducks toward the waiting guns. Time af—
ter time, excess ducks were simply thrown away.

Most revolting are charges that some profes-
sionals —~ the very persons who should be role
models of sportsmanship —- were not content
with killing ducks and geese. They casually shot
herons, golden plovers, belted kingfishers, kill-
deer and red-tailed hawks. All these are on the

protected list. How could anyone kill an ibis?

Except for a few species, geese are in no
danger of going the way of the passenger pigeon.
Their population seems to be holding steady. It
is different with ducks. The breeding population
of the northern pintail in 1988 is the second low—
est on record, 54 percent below the average for
1955-87. The blue-winged teal has declined 25
percent below average. In 1958 a census found a
breeding population of nearly 13 million mal-
lards; that number has dropped by half.

To be sure, these declines may be attributed
only in small part to the lawless conduct of pseu-
do-sportsmen. Most of the problem stems from
drought in breeding grounds. Some of it probably
is owing to toxic pesticides and herbicides. Even
so, the bang-bang boys who shoot for simple
“slaughter” cannot be condoned, and their cyni-
cal guides ought. to be run out of business.

None of this is to condemn hunting. It is the
oldest of all sports; it brings millions of Ameri-
cans a little closer to nature; it teaches the prop-
er use of firearms; and for countless families,
hunting provides an important source of food.

Nothing is wrong with lawful hunting. The other ,

kind? The kind described in these indictments?
Nothing whatever is right about it.—(c1988.)

day. ”Please take care of me,” the
not-e read/1 can brighten your life!”

Santonocito decided, with regret,
that she couldn't take care of the dog.
Rocky was taken to the St. Louis
County Animal Shelter.

That much of his life was the sub-
ject of an article in Thursday’s Post-
Dispatch. More than 100 people
called to ask about adopting him, said
Dan Knox, a veterinarian at the

shelter.

In a nutshell, here’s the history of
how Rocky made it to Santonocito’s
back yard:

The Robbens noticed some time
ago that Rocky seemed jealous of
Kristin, their new daughter. Although
they had treated Rocky as a member
of the family since they bought him
in 1986, the Robbens decided that it
would be better for Rocky to be
placed in another home.

“It was hard for us to give him up,”
said Marilyn Robben, 22.

The Robbens got in touch with Liz
Edwards, 24, a representative of
Purebred Dog Rescue of St. Louis, a
nonprofit organization that finds

need to give Rocky his medicine reg-

”She was waiting for the perfect
dog, and Rocky was it,” Edwards
said.

Schneider, who lives in Kirkwood
near Santonocito, got the dog Mon-

said. “And she was frantic.”

When Edwards pointed out Thurs-
day’s newspaper story to Schneider,
Schneider confronted her roommate,
who admitted that Rocky had not
jumped the fence.

“It was her roommate, who was
scared of dogs and who didn’t think
Ginny would get rid of it on her own,”
Edwards said. The roommate wrote
the note and delivered Rocky to San-
tonocito’s back yard, she said.

The incident caused a considerable
amount tension between Schneider
and her roommate, Edwards said.
“She told her to pack her stuff and
get out,” Edwards said.

Schneider refused to discuss
Rocky, and her ex-roommate could
not be reached for comment.

In the end, Rocky was reclaimed
by the Robbens, who believe the dog
will get over his jealousy.

“All that he’s been through, it’s just
been too much on him,” Marilyn Rob-
ben said. “We’ll find the time for
him.”

Dog’s Tale

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - December 3—1, 1988

 




Though the lion and elephant
houses have been torn down and
fewer animals are kept here now,
much of designer Frederick Law
Olmsted’s vision of exalted rustic—
ity remains. Massive statues and
arches rise out of this urban veldt
as focal points for expansive
views.

The scene is no longer marred
by huge mounds of dirt, dubbed
the Dorchester Alps. which were
excavated during construction of
the new tropical rain forest pavil-
ion.

Hayes-Shea admits she was
“shocked" by reports that there
may not be enough money avail-
able to maintain the temperature
in the new multimillion-dollar ex-
hibit, due to open next summer.
Zoo officials deny the reports and
say hopes are high for acceptance
by the Legislature in its next ses-
sion of a new state plan to get the
zoo management reorganized and
better financed.

But the animals don’t worry
about such things, and they’re
certainly not unhappy about low
attendance, Lineham says.

“Many animals would rather
be off in the bush by themselves
with humans far away." agrees
'state Zoo Commissioner Mark
Goldstein.

The park’s recently restored
but still under—visited bird house.
with a gee-whiz pagoda-style fa-
cade from the 19205, houses one of
the nation’s few nesting pairs of
hammerkops. The swelling belly
of a new female Grevy’s zebra. a
shy and rare breed with markings
like fine lithography, suggests a
successful adjustment.

Though the public image of the
200 is one of unhappy. ill-cared-for
animals who are frequent targets
of vandalism. Goldstein asserts in-
cidents are rarer proportionally
than at most zoos. Officials put
the death toll due to vandalism. of
four? birds and one an antelope,
over an eight—year period.

Many of the exhibits have been
upgraded ‘in recent years. and
wh’at decrepitude does meet the
public eye is often poor stagecraft.
which offends people more than
animals. . -’

It's humans who find the old-
fashioned utility fencing aestheti-
cally displeasing in the range area
where Hayes-Shea works. While
moats separate visitors from the
animals at newer exhibits, the
animals may well prefer Franklin
Park's homely old chain link.
Hayes—Shea observes. “Most ani—
mals are afraid of people. and hay-

ing a visible fence up may make
them feel more secure." ,

Hayes-Shea majored in biology
and animal illustration in college.
An internship at the Bronx Zoo
helped lead her to a full-time job at
Franklin Park Zoo.

Her chores range from muck—
ing out animal houses to taking
daily urine samples from an ailing
male antelope. (“You pat his back.
hold out the cup and then say
thank you”)

But unlike her charges, Hayes-
Shea wishes more people would
visit the zoo. The Range, the area

where she works with the “hoofed
stock," is the least-visited part of
the zoo. Entire Saturdays can
pass in midwinter without her
seeing a visitor.

The zoo population now in-
cludes 15 keepers. 400 birds. 50
mammals up in Hayes-Shea’s
range area and 200 assorted ani-
mals in the pleasant children’s
zoo, which was totally rehabbed
in 1984. >

But still the visitors don’t
come. Attendance has been ﬂat at
about 30,000 a year at the chil.
dren’s zoo, the most frequented
feature. In contrast. the sister zoo
in suburban Stoneham draws
250,000 annually.

Fear of crime is a big reason
people stay away, Hayes-Shea
says. “A lot of people say Franklin
Park is a horrible area. I wouldn't
go out in Franklin Park myself
alone at night, but the zoo is a
small secure area, which is per-
fectly safe."

She reaches down to scoop up a
wind’blown plastic popcorn bag
just ahead of the long omnivorous
tongue of a small oak leaf—munch—
ing antelope called a yellow-
backed duiker.

A rare species destined for the
new tropical pavilion, the duiker
does indeed have schoolbus-yellow
markings on his back. Otherwise
he looks like a cross between a
fawn and a faun. with large dark
eyes, an active nose, short Pan—
like horns and a high-strung
prance.

To calm them down in captiv-

ity. some zoo-born duikers are bot- ‘

tle-fed by humans. This one was.
and he rushes to the fence when
he sees Hayes—Shea, hoping to be
petted or scratched. She resists,
though finally she proffers a
handful of grass through the
chain-link fence.

”They're not pets. They're wild
animals." Hayes-Shea explains.
”We don‘t go into the yard \I“???

 

 

them unless there's an emergen-
cy. We‘re trying to keep them as
wild as we can. it’s good for the
animals to be a little afraid of hu—
mans. lt's safer for them and safer
for us."

Like most of the 200 personnel.
Hayes-Shea sees the tropical pavil—
ion as the best hope of getting
more visitors. A giant greenhouse
set up to resemble a rain forest,
the display will feature a family of
gorillas as its main draw. Other
displays will include endangered
fish species from Lake Victoria in
Africa.

There will also be glamorous
new quarters for the yellow 9
backed duikers and for the bon-
gos. giant tan antelopes with
white stripes and corkscrew
horns that trophy hunters covet.

Hayes-Shea says she’d like to
continue working with them in.
the tropical pavilion, where she
would have more contact with the
public. Her dearest dream is to
someday work with wolves.

But right now, she’s worried
about holding on to what she has.
“i love myjob, and ljuSt hope I get
to stay here. When you're a state
employee and there‘s a big budget
cut coming, you can’t help worry—
ing. 1 hope they won’t take the
money from here."

As if pit bulls weren’t tough enough, now they’re getting tattooed

By Constance Prater
News Staff Writer

tims of pit bull attacks say the breed has
gotten a bad reputation.

 

Sam’s eyes were
open but glazed, and
his tongue lolled out
of his mouth as he
lay on the metal ta—
ble. A few minutes
later, like a tipsy
sailor on shore leave,
Sam was tattooed
for life.

But Sam doesn’t
fit the stereotype,
and he wasn’t even
in a tattoo parlor.

He’s a 13-
month-old brindle-
colored cross-breed
pit bull terrier. And
under a new ordi-
nance, Sam — dog
No. M114166A —— is
now legal in the eyes
of the city of De—
troit.

The law gives pit
bull owners until
Jan. 9 to have their
pets tattooed with a
state registration
number. After that,
animal control offi-
cers can pick up and
destroy unregistered
American Stafford-
shire terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers,
American pit bull terriers or any mixture
of those breeds.

The Detroit City Council passed the
law last month after a number of pit bull
attacks in the city.

IN RECENT DAYS, veterinarian Al
Sibinic has been tattooing registration
numbers on at least three dogs a day at
Detroit’s Animal Control Center. Sam
was one of his recent “patients.”

Sibinic anesthetized Sam in minutes,
placing the dog’s limp, 62-pound body on-
to a metal examining table. With orange
cord, Sam’s left hind leg was tied out of
the way, to a nearby cage.

The inside of his right thigh was quick-
ly shaved, and Sibinic applied an antisep»
tic to prevent infection.

He drew Sam’s number on the skin
with a marking pen. Sibinic then pierced
the upper layers of the dog’s skin, retracl
ing the identification with a high-speed,
electric tattoo gun.

Sibinic said Sam, who breathed lightly
throughout the operation, didn’t feel a
thing. Hours later, Sam was up, romping
inside his cage. The procedure took 15
minutes and cost Sam’s owner $25.

Sibinic, dog owners and even some vic-

if “There are not. ir—
' responsible dogs, but
irresponsible own-
ers,” Sibinic said. “If
you leave a dog chai—
ned in the back yard
without feeding it
and let the kids in
the neighborhood
tease it at the fence,
after awhile. his fuse
is going to get.
shorter.”

Since the council
approved the ordi~
nance. the animal
control clinic has
more than doubled
its pit bull tattoo
operations. While
they imprinted only
45 dogs last month.
December's total is
expected to be as
high as 90, officials
said. .

The city clinic is
booked into next
month, and it is
urging pit bull own—
ers to go to private
clinics to meet the
deadline.

 

CATHY SCHMITTLIN G is a tat-
tooer for Breeder‘s Action Board Inc. of
Taylor, a nonprofit organization whose
services include dog identification.
Schmittling said that while she disagreed
with singling out one breed of dog, the or-
dinance has had a positive aspect: It. has
increased the number of owners who are
getting their pets tattooed with identiﬁca-
tion numbers.

The markings will tell animal control
officers how to find and prosecute owners
of vicious dogs. But they also will help lost

dogs ﬁnd their owners, Schmittling said.

' She has tattooed 118 Detroit pit bulls in

the last year, 30 of them since‘Nov. 30.

Schmittling. who is not a licensed vet-
erinarian, doesn’t anesthet ize dogs before
tattooing them and only occasionally
muzzles them. Owners hold their pets
while she uses an ink gun to imprint the
numbers.

She said the animals usually sit still
and feel little pain —— except one recent
morning, when an emerypit bull refused
to obey either Schmittling or its owner.

Schmittling didn’t hesitate to refer dog
and owner to a local veterinarian for tat—
tooing under anesthesia.

“It was best to put him under,” she said.

“I'm not interested in losing my face.”

The Associated Press

Willie B., Zoo Atlanta's silverback gorilla, has spent most of his
30 years as a couch potato in a cage. Willie has slimmed down
to a trim 440 pounds and will soon be introduced to females.

Willie B. about to meet

the gorilla of his dreams

ATLANTA (UPI) — Willie B.,
one of the nation’s most eligible
gorillas, might soon end a life of
celibacy.

Elated Zoo Atlanta officials re-
' cently determined that Willie B. —-
; who has never even seen a female
i gorilla—was fertile.

Last week, the 30-year-old go-
" rilla was anesthetized and given a
j; complete physical, including his
first sperm test. '
.. Doctors were surprised to ﬁnd
that after a life of celibacy, Willie
was not only producing semen but
in amounts and qualities compara-
ble to gorillas of proven fertility.

If everything goes well, "we’re
probably talking about three
months” before Willie is intro-
duced to females, Dr. Rita McMan-
amon, the 200’s staff veterinarian,
said.

Until this summer, Willie had
never seen another gorilla. That.
changed when he joined several
families from the Yerkes Regional
Primate Center in moated com-
pounds at the 200’s new Ford
African Rain Forest habitat.

Willie‘s prospective mates are
Katoomba. a 26-year-old female
who has beer use“. at" a. group in
the can, :‘..:i‘:etei:;ing Willie’s,

and Kinyani, a 5~year-old in an-
other family.

Neither has fared well in these
families; Katoomba has been
largely ignored and Kinyani,
McManamon said, has been bitten
a couple of times.

"The ﬁrst thing is to get the ‘
females used to each other so that .
if something went wrong, one
would stand up for the other,” she
said. "They’ve had visual access to
Willie, but they haven’t been close
enough to have any reaction.”

Katoomba and Kinyani are liv- .
ing together, and they "seem to
like each other pretty much,”
McManamon said.

"Their personalities are a little
more passive” than most females.
the doctor said. “We hope they
would be good for an animal who‘s
never been with other animals."

Since his introduction to out-
door living in the summer, Willie
has shown considerable interest in
his neighbors, McManamon said.

"Sometimes he does a little
yelling at the males and beats his
chest,” she said. "There have been
times when we’ve found him
hanging around where he could
look at the other gorillas.”

3-Year Investigation Reveals
Slaughter of Ducks in South

By J. Edwin Smith

Staff \l’i‘ii‘t’r

Despite the public outcry and subse-
quent federal legislation to protect water-
fowl. America‘s gunners are shooting
ducks in record-breaking numbers.

And in some instances. the killing is
being done illegally, primarily in the
South.

“Slaughter, there is no other way to
describe what‘s been going on.“ said an
undercover agent for the US. Department
of the Interior‘s Fish and Wildlife Service
(USFWS).

The department recently concluded
the largest undercover investigation of
duck hunters and commercial duck hunt.-
ing clubs in the nation’s history. .

Spending three years in duck blinds
along the Gulf Coast of Texas and other
areas throughout the South, USFWS
agents documented 1,300 violations. A
spokesman for the agency said 22 hunting
guides and owners were arrested last
week. 21 in Texas and one. in Iowa.

Indictments or charges contained in a
federal document named 52 others, and
135 people were to receive notices this
week in Texas. Alabama. Maryland. Michi-
gan. Oklahoma and Georgia for violations
that occurred in Texas.

The charges include felony and misde-
meanor violations of the Migratory Bird
Treaty Act and the Lacey Act.

The senior USFWS agent in Atlanta,
Tom Wharton. would not comment on any
specifics of the investigation. .

“I am unable to go into any details at
this time." said Mr. Wharton. “because of
the nature of the investigation and be-
cause some of the violators have yet to be
apprehended. I can not provide you With
further information."

He did say the violations included the
wanton overkilling of snow geese, blue
geese. pintails, teal and redhead duck
species. _

Misdemeanor violations of the Migra-
tory Bird Treaty Act can carry penalties of
six months in prison and fines of $5.000
for individuals and $10,000 for organiza-
tions. Penalties for felony violations are
two years in prison and fines of up to
6250.000 for individuals and $500.00?) ‘
organizations ' .

Misdemeanor violations of the Lacey
Act can carry penalties of one year in
prison and fines of $100,000 for individ—
uals and 8200.000 for organizations. Felo-

ny violations may result in five years in _

prison and fines of up to $250,000 for indi-
viduals and $500,000 for organizations.

Frank Dunkle. director of the USFWS.
said that the indictments included
charges of shooting more than the legal
limit; “rallying" or stirring up waterfowl
to drive them toward hunters; use of lead
shot in steel shot. zones; failure to retrieve
shot fowl; use of electronic calls; taking
birds after the season has closed or out-
side legal hunting hours; and tagging and
record-keeping violations, such as claim-
ing birds belong to someone who had not
hunted that day. or falsifying when birds
were shot.

“During this investigation, service
agents reported flagrant violations of laws
intended to protect waterfowl.“ said Mr.
Dunkle. “Law-abiding waterfowlers are
outraged by these unethical and unsport-
ing practices that betray total lack of con-
cern for the status of waterfowl
populations?“

. “The violations are so rampant it‘s
Sickening,” said another undercover agent
who requested anonymity.

“At certain times we brought in agents
from the East Coast to work undercover.
and they couldn‘t believe it. It's gotten to-
tally out of hand down here. totally not of
control."

_ On one undercover operation. agents
witnessed hunters shooting over 100 birds
in excess of their legal limit.

On another hunt, agents posing as
hunters filmed the shooting by 13 hunters
of 204 snow geese drawn to a small pond
baited with grain. On another hunt. 19
hunters killed 171 snow geese. In another
instance. 18 hunters killed 130 geese.

The legal limit. of snow geese per
hunter is five.

The poaching violations come at a.

time when duck populations are already
stressed by an eight-year drought in their
breeding grounds. The number of migra-
tory birds this year has been estimated at
66 million, down 8 million from the year
before. In 1979 this migratory flight iium-
bered 96 million birds.

“Duck numbers already are near rec-
ord lows because of the drought and con-
tinued destruction of their natural habi-
tat," Mr. Dunkle said. “They can not long
withstand additional losses from illegal
harvest.

“The US. Fish and Wildlife Service
will not tolerate violations of the water-
fowl hunting regulations."

Robert Adamcik prepares to cremate a dead goose at Attwater
Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge on Monday.

Geese deaths slowing

:with warmer weather

iBy Harold Scarlett

 

EPOST ENVIRONMENT REPORTER

Wildlife officials found only a
few dozen more dead geese on
Texas coastal prairies Monday and
voiced hope that an outbreak of
avian cholera may taper off if the
Weather remains favorable.

“As long as the weather stays
fairly warm, we're hopeful the
birds will get by this crisis time,"
said Steve Labuda. a US. Fish and
Wildlife Service spokesman.

“But if we get a real nasty cold
front that lasts for several days with
drizzle, things could worsen dra—
matically,” he added.

After collecting more than 5,100
dead geese from the prairies west
of Houston through Sunday night,
wildlife officials found no new ma—
jor concentrations of cholera-in—
fected carcasses Monday.

A wildlife service agent conduct-
ed an aerial search of the coastal
prairies from Beaumont to Palacios
‘on Monday, but sighted only a few
dead geese around the McFaddin
National Wildlife Refuge near
Beaumont and the Brazoria nation—
al refuge near Freeport, a spokes—
man said.

“Those may have just been
hunting cripples,” said Labuda,
manager of the Attwater Prairie
Chicken National Wildlife Refuge
near Eagle Lake.

Dead geese collected in the
Katy. Brookshire and Eagle Lake
areas are being brought to the
Attwater refuge for cremation in a
portable incinerator.

The cholera fighters have raised
$17,500 to help farmers and ranch-
ers pay fuel costs for pumping well
water to flush out bacteria—laden
roosting ponds and wetlands.

With an estimated 550,000
drought-weakened migratory
geese packed along the upper Tex-
as coast, wildlife officials have
warned of a potential cholera catas-
trophe that could surpass a record
1980 kill of 100,000 geese in Ne-
braska. 7

Altogether, Labuda said, 1,836
dead birds have been found in the
Katy area, and another 3,314 in the
Attwater refuge, Eagle Lake and
other Colorado County areas.

A number of civilian volunteers
joined state and federal agents Sun-
day in what he called a “really
magnificient” cleanup effort.

The federal refuge manager par-
ticularly praised two Katy area

hunting guides, Larry Gore and
Jim Longtin, saying they worked
independently to pick up many
carcasses and then notified state
and federal agencies of their finds.

Labuda reiterated that the only
two recorded ”human cases of avian
cholera involved laboratory techni-
cians who were working with the
bacteria. He said thorough cooking
would eliminate any risk from
cholera-infected geese.

Bu he pointed out that an ailing
bird might also have psittacosis Or
some other disease that could be
dangerous to humans.

Labuda advised hunters not to
eat any waterfowl that was obvi—
ously sick when taken.

 

 

 

Pound seizure OK

IN A DEC. 6 LETTER.
Peggy Ryan—Smith called the
practice of using unwanted
pound animals for research rm:
practical and inhumane.’ The
opposite is true.

Purchasing pound animals for
research uses is one of the least.
expensive methods to obtain ex-
perimental subjects. Alterna—
tives, like buying from an ani-
mal supplier or using computer ‘
models, are costlier.

Computer modeling is not ad—
vanced enough at present to
make it a feasible alternative and
suppliers selling animals charge
prices many times the $35 the
Dallas city shelter charges.

The money saved allows re—
searchers to perform more ex-
periments, speeding up medical
progress, helping to offset a bur—
den on federally funded projects
—- keeping more tax dollars

~ working elsewhere —— and pro-

viding revenue for Dallas.

Ryan—Smith’s argument inher—
ently makes a distinction be-
tween former pets and animals
raised specifically for research.
Former pets are just that —- for-
mer pets. There is a specified
time they are held when people
can claim them. At the end of
that time period their destiny is
the same as other animals,
death.

Instead of a wasteful death,
they can be used to help hu—
mans.

430- Pound Ape ls Raising Baby Alone

Meet Mr. Mom

In an unprecedented human-like display of love, an aging
430-pound gorilla named Bongo has taken over the care
and feeding of his young son after the death of the little ape’s
mother.

Bongo is so concerned for the welfare of his son Fossey
that he unselfishly shares his food with the baby -— and would
go hungry if zookeepers didn’t step in to make sure he eats, too.

Hunter’s bullet finds target

 

By Lewis Grizzard

 

0 NE day I pick up a copy of USA To-
day and there’s a front-page story
, about the deer population growing too
fast so hunters are now allowed to kill
more than they used to.

Seems the deer are becoming a nui-
sance because they go into people’s
yards and eat their ﬂowers and grass.

It was one of those “we’re doing it for
the deer” stories, and I’m thinking
that’s all just dandy, but if I were a deer,
I’d just as soon they didn’t do me a favor
by killing me. ’

Weren’t the deer here first? Didn’t

- we become a nuisance to them by cut-

ting down all the forests and putting up
houses and buildings? Don’t we owe the
deer a break?

The next day, I pick up the Atlanta
newspaper and there’s a story that cut
right through me.

Dale Brown and Joanne Kimbrough
of Greene County were in love. He was
15. She was to turn 14 the next day.

They went walking into the woods
and sat down by a tree to celebrate first
love. They were kissing when a bullet
cut through Dale Brown’s head and
went into Joanne Kimbrough’s arm.
Dale was killed.

 

DENVER POST - 12/22/88

J.R. Stiwinter, a hunter from South
Carolina, was in the same woods hunt-
ing deer. He thought he saw one, so he
aimed his riﬂe at his prey and pulled
the trigger, ending one young life and
destroying, at least temporarily, an-
other.

They arrested J .R. Stiwinter for invol-
untary manslaughter. He should be ar-
rested for murder and stupidity.

“What they ought to do with that
guy,” said a friend, “is make him go off
into the woods wearing a pair of antlers
the first day of deer season next year.”

I have friends and relatives who go
deer hunting, but I’ve never quite un-
derstood the thrill.

Teacher Sues UC Over Animal Rights

By LA. C'lumg
ChronicleEastBawa'eau

A veterinary professor who
sought alternatives for students
who objected to killing labora-
tory animals charged yesterday
that the University of Califor-
nia tried to dismiss him because
of his views on animal rights.

Professor Nedim C. Buyukmih-
ci, a tenured professor at UC Davis’
School of Veterinary Medicine,
sued the university in an attempt to
stop disciplinary proceedings be-
gun against him last July. His suit,
filed in Alameda County Superior

Court, contends that his freedom- ;
of-speech rights are being violated .

by the university’s actions.

University officials declined to
comment on the suit, citing state
confidentiality laws.

Buyukmihci also charged that
the griiversity has harassed and
punis ed him by denying a recom-
mended merit increase, falsely ac-
cusing him of unprofessional con-
duct toward a graduate student, at-
tempting tc discredit him with oth-

er academic institutions and

ordering him to stop using the uni-
versity letterhead for correspon-
dence related to animal rights.

Buyukmihci is a co—founder

and president of the Association of

Veterinarians for Animal Rights

Although the ophthalmology .
professor had clashed previously
with the university, his conflict 5

with officials came to a head in a
required course, “Veterinary Oph-
thalmology.”

Buyukmihci had been ap-
proached by students who objected
to a surgery lab that required stu-
dents operate on healthy dogs’ eyes,
then kill the dogs after the Opera-
tion, he said. Buyukmihci allowed
students who objected on moral or

ethical grounds to work on dead ;

dogs or terminally ill dogs that
would be killed for humane rea-
sons.

Last December, he sought to
change the veterinary ophthalmolo-
gy course to allow the use of live
animals only if the animals were
terminally ill. The school’s curricu-
lum committee denied the request
and shortly afterward removed Bu-
yukmihci as course leader.

Mari! Stratton, UC Davis’ direc-
tor of public communications, said
that the university purchases 41

dogs a year for the course -- dogs
destined to be destroyed at the Sac-
ramento County pound. The dogs
are killed after being fully anesthe-
tized, she said. ’

Buyukmihci, a former regent
of the American College of Veteri-
nary Ophthalmologists, contended
the teaching alternative is educa.
tionally sound. He wrote letters to
veterinary students, offering to
help them if they wanted to ap-
proach the new course professor to

Letters

prevail upon him to allow students
to operate on terminally ill animals
or dead animals.

A short time later, the veteri-
nary school initiated disciplinary
charges against Buyukmihci, con~
tending that he had failed to adhere
to faculty rules of conduct, attempt-
ed to coerce the judgment of stua
dents, deliberately interfered with
the conduct of the course and dem-
onstrated lack of respect for the
faculty and the profession.

ATLANTA JOURNAL - December 29, 1988

Animal Research Might Have

 

 

 

Helped Protesters Themselves

The Editors: I read with inter-
est your Dec. 13 article regarding
the protest staged at Emory Univer-
sity by In Defense of Animals. I am,
and have been. engaged in laborato-
ry research at Emory that soon will
result in improved surgical methods
for the treatment of patients with
certain forms of heart disease.

As the article mentioned. one of
the three animal rights activists re-
sponsible for hanging the banner
from the roof of the Woodruff Me-
morial Research Building suffered
from mild hypothermia, secondary
to her exposure to the cold weather.
The protesters placed themselves at
risk for other injuries as well, as
they could have easily fallen, sus-
taining and head and/or spinal cord
injury in addition to hypothermia.

The animal rights protesters fail
to acknowledge several important
facts about medical research utiliz-
ing animals. They themselves may
very well have benefited from that
research, had they sustained more
serious injuries. Would they have
refused life-saving treatments be-
cause the therapies in question
were developed by researchers us-
ing animals? I doubt it!

Animal research using dogs has
contributed significantly to the cur-
rent treatment of severe hypother-
mia, resulting in the saving of pre-
cious human lives. The treatment of
head injury has evolved in no small
part due to advances made in the
laboratory utilizing an animal
model.

Studies in rodents and other
species. including monkeys. have
contributed to our understanding of
spinal cord injury. These studies

bring new hope that one day pa-
tients with spinal cord injury may
regain movement.

Patients with head injury fre

quently experience impaired
speech. Researchers at Yerkes have
developed. through research with
chimpanzees. a computer-operated.
keyboard that enables handicapped
people to communicate. Following
head trauma. a certain percentage
of individuals develop epilepsy.
Current research at Yerkes may
lead to improve medications for the
control of post-traumatic epileptic
seizures.

The animal rights protesters at
Emory University were lucky. The
injuries sustained were minor and
did not require any of the. advanced
treatments made possible by .nima}

research. If they had not been so
fortunate. they might very well have
a different view of the animal re-
search issue.

inlust ask his agents and best
friends, Scottsdale residents Donn
and Pam Moseley.

fA year ago, the Moseleys were
wrought with worry over Beater’s
reaction to the summer sun.

.~ It seems the sun heated his
black coat and made it difficult to
breathe through his pushed-in
pose.

So his owners began shaping
newspaper hats for the animal.
They were unacceptable —- as
W?” as unfashionable.
‘I’On the lookout. for help, the
Moseleys found canine caps at a
small dog stere in Lake Havasu

{With a few design changes, they
thought it might get Beater back

tlie hat with foam so they could
soak it with water in the high

brother Astro, ”a wire-haired
dachshund of some type.”

"The response was amazing,“
reported Mosely, who has learned
to carry a box of the hats in his
car.

One thing led to another and the
Moseleys now own a small busi-
ness with Ode.

The couple hits the weekend
arts and craft shows and whole-
sales their hats to a few animal
boutiques and veterinarians
around town.

The Moseleys credit their suc-
cess on Beater and Astro.

The canines have learned to sit
quietly for hours modeling the
hats, while old ladies make goo-goo
noises at them and small children
pull their ears.

“People think. ‘My dog would
never wear that.’ We hear that all
the time,” Mosely said. .

But any dog can learn to wear it,
he said, if it is associated with
something they love, like eating or
walking.

The doggie visor fits snuggly on
the head with holes cut out for the
ears and a Velcro strap under the
chin.

poodle to St. Bernard and range in
price from $8 to $12.

Beach dogs, such as Golden

ian prints, while hounds and
pointers are more apt to go for the
camouflage or bandana prints.

For the Afghans and wolfhounds
there are bright solid colors, in-

cluding hot pink, wine and white, ~

poodles will prefer the polka-dot
and red-and—white-heart prints.

 

DEKALB NEWS/SUN — Atlanta - December 28, 1988

loss Of Research Would Harm Humans

1 wish to emphasize the prime
importance of the work of the
Yerkes Regional Primate Research
in relation to the human problem
of drug abuse. Progress in this
area is critical since the intrave-
nous use of drugs by addicts is a
major factor in the spread of AIDS.

As an investigator in the field of
narcotic addiction for the past 25
years -— with experience in both
laboratory and clinic -- I can testify
to the indispensible role that pri-
mate research has played in link-
ing neurochemical ﬁndings to dis-
orders of human behavior. Discov-
ery of specific binding sites for
narcotic drugs would have had
little meaning for students of
human behavior (and misbehavior)
without the development of behav-
ioral analogues in animals. ‘

Since addictive behavior in hu-
mans is a complex phenomenon --
involving a range of biological

functions from cellular reactions to
abstract thought ._ it must be stu-
died at many levels of organiza-
tion. Primates, being closest to
man in brain function, provide an
essential link between the labora-
tory and the clinic. In particular,
the demonstration of addictive be-
havior in primates separates this
phenomenon from disorders of
thinking that are unique to man.

Of course, research involvmg
primates must be carefully
planned and conducted (as indeed
should all experiments with ani-
mals). Yerkes is a recognized
leader in combining excellent care
of animals with quality research.
It would be a serious loss if the
outstanding work of this labora-
tory were terminated.

~ + New laws

reduce
pit bull
problem

But Vicious dog issue
hasn’t disappeared .

By George Lane
Denver Post Staff Writer

Laws enacted in the past two
years to control the problem of vi-
cious pit bulls in Colorado are do—
ing the job, but the dilemma posed
by the dogs has not disappeared.

As pit butt popularity go: out of
hand, cities throughout Colorado
began drafting ordinances to con-
trol the muscular dogs with the
viselike jaws.

Pit bulls have attacked and se»
verely injured at least 18 peeple in
Colorado in the past four war ._..
and kiiieo‘ one cinid in Dem-er.

Organized, illegal dogfights also
cropped up in rural areas, prompt-
ing the passage of countywide or-
dinances.

But efforts to outlaw pit bulls
specifically were thwarted as pit
bull owners and animal rights ac-
tivists complained that the dogs
are not naturally dangerous but
create problems when improperly
trained.

Amid such arguments, a number i

of communities instead adopted or-
dinances to control “vicious” dogs
and animals in general.

What happened in Denver after
the October 1986 pit bull mauling
death of 3-year-old Fernando Sala-
zar is a prime example.

Gilbert Trancosa had been sued
because of his attacking, vicious
dogs. After one of his dogs killed
the boy, Trancosa was sentenced
to 180 days in jail for not licensing
and “controlling the animal. The
dog was destroyed.

The new Denver law that result-
ed called for “vicious dogs” to be

confined in enclosures with walls ._
at least 8 feet high, among other "

rules.

The small toWn of Simla, howev-
. er, wasn’t influenced by supporters
of the breed.

 

A resolution passed there on

, Aug. 3, 1987. specificaiijt hens

“Staffordshire Terrier. Buii Terri-

er breed of dog, American Pit Bull

‘ Terrier breed of dog." dogs of mix-

‘ ed breeds known as pit, bulls and

any dog with the appearance or
characteristics of a pit bull.

Although there had not been a
pit bull attack in the town north-
east, of Colorado Springs, Town
Clerk Avelyn Ullom said, the dogs
were roaming the town, frighten-
ing residents.

Colorado Springs and several
Denver-area cities Opted for laws
that range from mandating high
fences to giving judges the right to
jail dog owners and order bad dogs
to death.

Since Thornton passed its law in
September 1987, six cases of pit
bull aggression have been brought
to municipal court, spokesman
Steve Roalstad said. Two animals
were destroyed, and the rest were
confined. Fines were levied in all
the cases.

in four other cases, owners of
dogs that had Cd’Chz'Li peopie gs » I.
up the animals for destruction be-
fore the matter reached court.

Thornton police Lt. Don Bills-
tone said the law has provided op-
tions for dealing with mean dogs.
but he doesn’t know if it has pre-
vented any attacks.

Aurora also gave judges power
to resolve pit bull cases. Statistics

‘ aren’t available, Municipal Judge
Richard Kaufman said, but the in-

cidents probably have decreased-

because the new laws and publicity
surrounding them have increased
awareness.

Colorado Springs, which
strengthened its law Dec. 1, has
seen increased problems with pet
pit bulls as well as illegal pit-bull
fights where gambling is the norm.

Such activities probably have
not slowed, said'Ron Hunter of the
Humane Society, but they have
leveled off since a major raid this
year on a Yoder ranch where pit
bulls were bred.

“All 34 animals had to be euthan-
ized right on the spot because they
couldn’t be transported safely . . .

because they’d just chew up the ‘

chain-link fencing to get at each

other,” Hunter said. “So the order ;
came down from the judge to have .’

them put away.

“One was an international cham-
pion named Thor. Whenever a pit .
bull wins a match in the pit, they ‘
make a little slice on the backside .
of its tail, like a notch on a gun. ‘

This dog had his complete tail.
from heel to tip, filled with
notches.”

Hunter said there haven’t been E

any dogfighting arrests since. But.
“Sooner or later. we expect anoth-
er bust.”

Yarbrough said.

Yerkes Science Program As-
sociate Director Harold M. McClure
said to entirely shut down all animal
research in Yerkes would have
disasterous effects on human health
and disease conditions.

McClure listed a number of
ongoing research programs as
among those that would be affected
if Yerkes studies were eliminated.
The programs include cancer, AIDS,
drug and vaccine testing,
Parkinson’s disease studies and eye
diseases.

“The vaccine testing done in the
laborartory needs to be done on
animals before it’s done on humans,
because first, the drugs must be

drug does some good,” he said.

“There are promising studies now
on using adrenal implants to al-
leviate the debilitating effects of
Parkinson’s disease. But additional
work must be done before it’s used
on humans,” McClure said. “You
should not take a drug developed in a
chemistry lab and go right into the
human population to figure out if it’s
effective, gr if it’s toxic.”

After the' activists were arrested,
Yerkes -.Center representatives
handed out literature'of their own,
including a letter to Emory Presi-
dent James Laney from Dr. Vincent
P. Dole, credited with the discovery
of methadone and used to help
heroin users to overcome their
addiction. The letter emphasized the
importance of the work of Yerkes
research.

Also included in Emory’s litera-
ture was a the position of statement
of the Emory University adminis-
tration, saying it shared a concern

Twelve arrested in protest
against Yerkes experiments

By David York
Neighbor Staff Writer

Twelve animal rights activists
were arrested Dec. 12, nine of them
outside Emory University‘s North
Decatur Road entrance as they
blocked the campus drive, during a
protest of the Yerkes Primate
Research Center’s use of animals in
laboratory experiments.

Three other activists were also
arrested after rappeling off and
hanging a banner saying “Save the
Yerkes Chimps” from the roof of
Woodruff Memorial Building. The
protestors, experienced rock
climbers, were eventually removed
by DeKalb County firemen.

“We’re trying to stop frivolous,
abusive drug abuse studies on
animals that are wasting money
that could be channeled into effec-
tive treatment programs. We want
Yerkes funding cut completely,"
said Ginger Redmon of DeKalb, a
local coordinator for In Defense of
Animals, a nationwide, California-
based organization opposed to
Emory University's Yerkes
Primate Center’s use of chim-
panzees and monkeys in drug addic—
firm experiments.

“The animals have no voice, but
we do,” Ms. Redmon said. “That’ 5
why we’re here.’

Ms Redmon said In Defense of
Animals is conducting a national
campaign targeting drug research
facilities, and Yerkes was the first
demonstration site.

Emory Police moved in and by
12:30 p.m. all the protesters had
dispersed or been arrested. Shortly
after being taken by police bus to
DeKalb County Jail, the activists
were released on their own re-
cognizance.

The group is planning another

demonstration for Christmas Eve e,
now planned as a candlelight vigil
and will be a quieter event. Ms.
Redmon said.

The activists offered literature
and passed a petition through the
crowd of about 75 people, among
them Ms. Redmon’s mother, De-
Kalb County Commissioner Sherry
Sutton, who watched the the demon-
stration but was not among its
participants.

Among speakers at the event
were Dr. Murry Cohen, director of
the Psychiatric Outpatient Depart-
ment. of New York‘s Lenox Hill

Hospital, Dr. Shirley McGreal, head
of the International Primate Protec-
tion League, and Washington DC.
attorney Valerie Stanley.

They and other animal rights
activists described Yerkes primate
experiments as horror stories in-
volving administering electrical
shock, cocaine. amphetamines, nic-
otine and caffeine to animals while
being forced to perform _ tasks
designed to measure the effects of
the various drugs, said Ms.
McGreal.

“We object to Yerkes’ use of
chimpanzees. They are an en-
dangered species," Ms. Redmon
said. “We‘re losing the war on drugs
while Yerkes is monkeying around
with substance abuse budgets.”

Emory researchers have noticed
animal rights protestors focus on
animal species with which they have
an emotional connection, such as
dogs cats and primates, while it is
rare for them to see an animal
rights demonstration about protect-
ing rodents. said Cathy Yarbrough.
Yerkes Primate Research Center
information services manager.

“Rodents constitute more than 90
percent of the animal research."

“The federal government is now
spending about $500 million a year
on these kinds of experiments and
we think it’s a waste,” said Ginger
Redmon, one of those arrested --
shortly after 12:30 pm. for blocking
the main entrance. “We want to
start just saying no to Yerkes.”

The most dramatic part of the
protest was conducted by Rod Coro-
nado, Lee Desseaux and Verena
Gill, three members of In Defense
of Animals from California, who
spent nearly an hour hanging from
the roof of the Woodruf‘f Memorial
Building on Clifton Road.

enced rock climbers, ﬁrst hung a :

Animal Rights Are No Joke

”A Barnyard Bill of Rights” (EUROPE,
Nov. 7) sounds trivial in the midst of
the threat of nuclear war, starvation,
poverty and racism. Nonetheless, it is
something that I wish every nation in the
world would consider. People who behave
cruelly toward animals often have no re-
spect for their fellow human beings. An
animal that gives 'its life [in order to
feed us] deserves to be killed—not tor-
tured to death.

ADDISON BIBB

I really despise the lighthearted and
patronizing tone that you used in report-
ing the story on Sweden’s newly enacted
animal-rights legislation. Does your writ-
er suppose that an animal needs to wear a
suit and speak English in order to suffer
and experience pain? That people in the
world's rich Western countries feel they
must kill to eat when other types of f wl

Hunting the Hanters of the Big Horn
'Sheep 1

Pro testers
Disrup t Shoo t
In Mojave

By Julia Gilden and James
Ridgeway
Special to The Chronicle

Baker, San Bernardino County

Califomia’s second annual
Nelson Big Horn sheep hunt
turned into a media circus on
opening day Saturday with cars
of hunters, ecological “hunt
saboteurs,” reporters and law
enforcement officials chasing
each other across the eastern
Mojave Desert.

Nobody shot any sheep, and the
high point came when the saboteurs
led a press convoy to the hunters’
base camp in a vain effort to pres-
ent Loren Lutz, a guide and sheep
hunter, with a $1.1 million civil suit
in a dispute dating to last year’s
hunt .

All day Friday, small squads of
self-styled saboteurs, looking more
like guerrilla fighters in Central
America than environmentalists,

took up positions deep in the Marble .

and Old Dad mountain ranges
where the hunt is being conducted

under the supervision of the Cali- .

fornia Fish and Game Department.

“Everyone has a right to be 3-

here,” said Marion Henry of the de-
partment.

The department held a lottery
earlier this year, and nine hunters
each won the right to shoot one of
the estimated 450 sheep who inhabit
the caves and peaks of these moun-
tain ranges.

Air Horns Slap Play

But as the hunters took aim
with bow or rifle at an elderly ram,
the saboteurs sounded air horns
that sent the sheep bounding off
into the distance.

 

The hunt began with a sunrise

visit from armed California State
Fish and Game wardens, who pro-
~tect wildlife, and Federal Bureauuof

goversee the land, to the hunt sabo

iteurs’ base camp 20 miles outside of
Baker near the foot of Old Dad
Mountain. Federal and state law en-
forcement officials are patroling
the area in pairs during the hunt to
arrest protesters under either state
or federal law, according to the type
of offense committed.

After a chilly greeting over a
struggling campfire, the wildlife
guardians departed, with pleas to
- work together for everyone’s health
and safety.

Sabotage Veteran

Protesters then held an im-
promptu press conference to an-
nounce their lawsuit and led a con-
voy of press cars to the hunters’
base camp 40 miles away. There,
Verena Gill, veteran of fox hunt
sabotages in England, thrust the
lawsuit into the startled hands of
Wyoming cowboy Bob Plunkett,
who was tidying up the camp.

Said Gill, “These hunts are im-
moral and we are prepared to put
ourselves on the line to sabotage
this ridiculous slaughter.”

 

 

.w\

No sooner had the troupe arriv-
ed than the Fish and Game and Bu:
reau of Land Management patrol
rushed onto the scene, with the
state’s Marian Henry standing be-
tween Plunkett and Gill and polite-
ly, but firmly, instructing the pro-
testers to leave the camp.

Returning to their base camp,
the saboteurs were visited by Britt
Wilson, a member of the Society for
the Conservation of Big Horn
Sheep, a group of sports hunters
who have attempted to increase the
numbers of the sheep, which are;
very seldom sighted.

Wilson took photographs of the

saboteurs’ banner, featuring a

ram’s head and defended s

law, as well as his society’s work in

Animal shelter policy will stand ‘

DALLAS Tll‘rlliS l‘lliRALD - Decmber 6, 1988

yPanel refuses to recommend halting sale of pets for research

I’

‘ By Robert V. Camuto

 

OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

Despite the pleas of animal rights advocates,
a Dallas City Council committee on Monday re—
fused to recommend the city shelter stop the
sale of dogs and cats for medical research.

About 40 advocates protested to the council’s
Housing, Health and Human Services Commit-
tee at City Hall that a city policy allowing un-
claimed pets to be sold for research at $35 each
is immoral. ; ’

All ﬁve committee members agreed to table
the issue. Three members said they believe the
policy should stand, effectively scuttling the is—
sue unless another committee member chooses
to raise it again. .

City Councilman Al Lipscomb, saying “hu-
man beings, God’s children” should take priori-
ty over domestic animals, maintained, “There is
no Way we can impede the progress of modern
medicine here in ’88.” He was joined by Coun-
cilmen Craig Holcomb and Charles Tandy in
supporting the existing policy.

Councilwoman Diane Ragsdale said they would
seek more information before deciding whether
to raise the issue again.

The debate is one that dozens ’of cities and
states have grappled with in recent years. At
issue is whether it is moral for humans to take
animals raised in homes or around people and

cal experiments.

In 1984, the city’s Animal Shelter Advisory.

Committee recommended banning such sales,
but the council committee declined to place the
matter before the full council.

Several Dallas suburbs, 'including Arlington
and Mesquite, have banned the sale of pets for
research.

During the ﬁscal year ending in September,
the city earned $56,630 from the sale of 1,358
dogs and 260 cats to five research facilities: The

At the city shelter, cats with

after three days. Cats without
collars generally are disposed of
after 24 hours.

' Dog Unleashes

Epileptic Animal
Lef’t With A Note

By Terry J. Hughes
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

Velma Santonocito spoke with a
quiver in her voice, the result of
two nearly sleepless nights.

“I don’t know the mystery of the
dog." she said Wednesday. “I think
it’s just pathetic. and I hope it has a
happy ending.”

The mystery began at 11:30 pm.
.Monday when the phone rang in
Santonocito’s home, in the 4534.3
block of George Avenue in Kirk-
wood. A voice, probably a young
woman’s, said that there was an an-
imal in Santonocito’s back yard.

“I turned the light on and I saw
this gorgeous German shepherd,”
she said. “I did hear scratching at
the window earlier, but I thought it
was the little black cat that my gray
cat brings over for dinner all the
time."

The shepherd. a lively 2-year-
old, was more than the average
abandoned dog. When two Kirk-
wood police officers arrived, they
found two bag tied to Santonocito’s
gate -— one holding dog biscuits
and the other holding a. note and a
bottle of prescription medicine.

“My name is Rocky,” the note
began. .. My birthday is July 4,
1986. I am very friendly and house-
broken and will be an excetient
watchdog,

“My only problem is that I have
epilepsy, but there is medicine that
I take each night before bedtime to
control the seizures. It is called Di-
lantin. and all you have to do is tell
me to sit and put the pill in my
mouth. . . .

“Please take care of me. I can
brighten your life!"

Santonocito. 72, said she felt her
heart breaking. She has a cat and
has owned several dogs and cats
over the years; the last dog, which
died two years ago, was a mutt that
had been abandoned at a neighbor-
hood convenience store and leaped
into her car one night.

But she said she felt she was just
too old to take care of another pet,
especially one as young and apps:-
ently energetic as Rocky.

“I just am not able, and it just
broke my heart." she said.

Rocky is now at the St. Louis

County Animal Shelter, 77 Hunter
Avenue in Ladue. Dan Knox, direc-
tor of the animal control depart-
ment, said the staff would try hard
to find a new home for the dog.

“He is very alert, up wagging his
tail and wanting to play,” Knox
said. "Epilepsy is a very treatable
disease. He apparently has been on
this (Dilantinj) some time.

“Last night we gave him the pills
just like the note said,” said Knox.
“We had him sit down, and he
opened his mouth up and took the
pill.”

He said he did not plan to track
down the previous owner or seek
any penalities.

“It sounded like they (the owner
or owners) were very attached to
the dog and very concerned for his
welfare." Knox said. “He's very

friendly, disciplined and seems to
be obedience-trained. For some
reason or another, they had picked

‘ out a home that they thought would

be good for it.”

Anyone interested in Rocky, or
other pets, can get in touch with the
shelter at 726-6655 or visit there
from 8 am. to 5:30 pm. Monday
through Friday, or until noon
Christmas Eve.

“Who knows?” Knox added. “We
might even find a red ribbon to put
around his neck.”

Santonocito hopes it will work.

“I do hope they find him a good
home,” she said. “I told my girl-
friend Pauline . . . that if they could
find someone to adopt him that’s
the best Christmas present I could
give to both of us.”

 




Im-purrfect Pet Peeves

By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

Tom Shen spent many agonizing moments sizing up
the prospects in the Puppy Parlor at the Humane
Society in St. Louis before emerging, with a black ball
of fur.

“It’s a German shepherd-something,” Shen, a medi-
cal student at St. Louis University, said of his Christ-
mas gift for his girlfriend, Liz Guller.

Asked how large he expected the puppy to get, Shen
gave it another nose-to-nose inspection and said, "It
depends on what else is in there.”

Shen was one of the many’ shoppers who decided a
pet was the ticket to a Merry Christmas.

By Christmas Eve, the Humane Society, at 1210
Macklind Avenue, had exhausted much of its puppy
inventory and was down to a single tan kitten.

Adult dogs, which are harder to place but equally
eager for homes, remained in good supply.

Jim Rigley, supervisor of the animal shelter, said he
always recommends against giving an animal as a gift.
He said the Humane Society offered gift certificates
— $35 for a dog and $30 for a female cat — that
include the cost of neutering.

“If you’re buying a pet for someone else, it’s better
to give them a gift certificate,” Rigley said. “What you
like, they might not like.

“But this is an emotional period of time, so people
adopt when they really shouldn’t.”

Rigley added, however, that returns have been de-
creasing in recent years. He has some advice for those
who received a dog or cat and are unsure about
keeping the animal. .

“If they truly don’t want the dog, consult friends
who might want it or turn it back into us,” he said.

“When they’ve made up their mind that they really
don’t want it, bring it back quickly because the longer

they keep it the more stressful it is for both the person
and the animal.”

Rigley said he expected that only about 3 percent of
this year’s adoptions would be returned.

“People are thinking it out a little more carefully,”
.he said. “They’re being more selective, they’re consid-
ering the size.

“There’s a trend going on in this country. People
are more aware of what’s going on with animals.
They’re more concerned. I think it’s refreshing.”

At Petland in Union Station, manager Mike Cook
also said gift certificates were better than the real
thing.

“If somebody says, ‘l’m buying it for a present for
somebody,’ we don’t encourage a live pet, we offer a
gift certificate,” Cook said.

“It’s not good for the animals to go to a home for
several days and then come back to the store. It’s a
stress factor.

“If an animal does not work out, we’ll exchange it
or give a refund, if necessary.”

Cook and Rigley, the Humane Society supervisor,
disagree on the giving of unusual and exotic pets.
Petland offers everything from garter snakes for $8.88
to parrots and macaws that cost up to $1,499.

Petland also sells ferrets for $78.88 to $98.88. Rigley
said these animals could be dangerous, citing an ex-
ample of a ferret that mauled an infant.

“They have teeth like a cat, and most people don’t
know how to care for them,” he said. “They’re cute,
they’re lovable, but when they are aggressive. they
can cause damage.”

Cook, however, said the questionable reputation of
these weasel-like animals was undeserved. He said
highly publicized cases of ferrets’ maiming people
had involved animals that had been mistreated.

“They make ideal pets as long as they’re trained
and disciplined, just like dogs and cats,” he said.

‘ Chimps’ pleasure
Exhibit to be

a fun place for
human, beast

By James L. Kerwin
News Staff Writer

 

 

The effect will be startling: Trails
shrouded in thick vegetation, moats and
waterfalls. a colony of noisy chimpanzees
swinging in trees orperched on rocks.

That’s the setting Detroit Zoo officials
plan for visitors next September when a
state-of—the art, $8-million chimpanzee
exhibit opens. The new exhibit, the only
one of its kind, is designed so visitors will
be. totaliy immersed in the presentation.

“There‘s nothing to compare t is,
anywhere.” said Gary Lee, whose Phiiadel-
phia architectural firm, Coe, Lee and
Robinson, designed the living quarters and
outdoor playgrounds, which include con-
crete-reinforced trees to swing from and
heated rocks to perch on in cold weather.

THE BURGHERS ZOO in Arnheim,
the Netherlands, has a chimp exhibit that
helped'inspire Lee and other designers.
But it won’t be in the same class as the
Detroit. chimp palace, Lee said.

The Detroit exhibit will be home to a
troop of three males and 15 females, which
are coming from zoos in Australia, Europe
and the United States.

The chimp colony is expected to set up
a household that will be carefully observed
and documented by scientists.

Because of the unique design, it is
expected to attract visitors from around
the world. The 41/2—acre display in the
center of the zoo grounds at Woodward
and 10 Mile Road will provide a natural
setting for the exotic apes, which are said
to be man’s closest animal relatives.

“What people will see is much like a
living soap opera, in which the chimps will
show aggression. tenderness and romance
in a closely knitted family life,” said Steve
Graham, zoo director.

The old and outmoded Holden Great
Ape House and Amphitheater, which for-
merly housed chimpanzees, was closed two
years ago.

SILUUIS POST-DISPATCH

Saudis Come To Missouri For Camels

By Ed Schafer
Of The Associated Press

CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. —- If
you want starlets, you go to Holly-
wood. If you want odds,'you go to
Las Vegas. If you want camels, you
go to Cape Girardeau.

“l guess you’d have to call this
place the camel capital of the coun-
try,” said Dave Hale, owner of the
5-H Ranchand keeper of the coun-
try’s largest herd of dromedaries. A
dromedary is a one-humped, Arabi-
an camel.

“Even the Saudis come to us for

camels,” Hale said.

Hale has about 600 head of exotic
animals on his ranch, just west of
Cape Girardeau. He called the
camels - all 100 or so of them —-
the best of the bunch. He said they
were intelligent, robust and easy to
care for.

“It’s a popular misconception
thatthese animals are mean — and
that they spit,” Hale said. He has
received his share of wounds from
animals, the most recent a bite in-
flicted by an irate chimpanzee.

“Camels aren’t like that. Some
are .really lovable and want to be
petted all the time. Others will do
anything you ask of them and then
just walk away, not wanting to be
fussed over. As long as you under
stand them and respect them,
they’re easy to get along with.

“As for the spitting, I don’t know
where that came from,” Hale add-
ed. “I’ve never seen one spit at a
human. Well, maybe once, but that
was more the result of an upset
stomach.”

Hale, once a horse breeder, said
his interest in exotic animals start-
ed a number of years ago “with one
llama and a lot of stupidity.”

Now he is one of the nation’s
largest suppliers of exotic animals
to circuses, zoos and other shows.

“Six of our camels worked all
last summer at the Big Apple Cirw
cus in New York,” Hale said. “And
others worked all over the country.
This last summer we had 21 trucks
on the road all the time.

“We must have been doing well;
they raised our auto insurance
$9,000.”

The most recent arrivals to the
ranch came from the Arabian Pen-
insula by way of Australia. Hale re-

Dave Hale, owner of the 5-

ceived 130 of the camels after a
long wait for them [0 clear

, quarantine.

“At least, we know they're
healthy,” he said. “First, they have
to spend 90 days in quarantine in
Australia and then 30 days more in
this country. The regulations are
pretty tough. If one animal comes
down sick, the whole batch is
rejected.”

The animals are purchased from
ranchers after they are captured in
the wild. he said. ‘

 

H Ranch in Cape Girardeau,
with one of his dromedary camels.

“A guy by the name of Tom
Smith of Galveston, Ind., goes down
there to buy them," Hale said. "One
of these days I’m going to get there
to watch a roundup. They say it’s
really wild.

“Guys on motorcycles chase
these running camels down and
catch them by their tails. It doesn’t
hurt them, but it makes for some
wild motorcycle riding.”

Once at his ranch, Hale said, the
camels have it made.

“In Australia, all they eat is dry

brush. Here they get hay and grain

.and begin to gain weight. They

come in looking pretty scrawny."

Hale, who has fought for humane
treatment of animals. said he had
more reason for keeping the ani-
mals fit than just his affection for
them.

“These creatures represent a
major investment," he said. “The
run-of-the-mill camel will sell from
between $8,000 to $10,000. The
white ones I breed — and I’ve got
the only ones in the country — can
go as high as $50,000 each.”

Circuses and zoos aren’t Hale‘s
only camel customers. The animals
are also in demand for their land-
scaping expertise.

“The federal government has al-
ready purchased eight and is going
to buy 20 more to be used to clear
brush in the desert Southwest. They
like to munch on the brush, but
they don’t care much for grass. It
gives the grass 3 chance to take
hold.”

He said a man in Jefferson City
had also bought 12 to eat brush off
his property.

Hale also gets a kick out of the
fact that one of his good customers
is a Saudi who lives in Yuma, Ariz.

“He buys them for racing stock.”
Hale said. “I mean real racing — in
Saudi Arabia. It just seems strange
for me to be on the phone in Cape
Girardeau selling camels to Abdul-
_Wahed Al-Saihati.

“But he really likes our animals.
and he can’t get over how we can
train them. When we work our
camels, they don’t have any kind of
a lead on or anything. They just
respond to voice commands. He
said he’d never seen that in
Arabia."

Hale admits that much of the
camels’ success is owed to the
trainers.

“When we first started, we were
able to accomplish a lot through
sheer ignorance,” said Hale, sitting
in his office in the main barn, sur-
rounded by the trappings and aro-
mas of his work.

“Nobody bothered to tell us there
were things we just couldn’t do. so
we went ahead and did them. Then
they came and told us it couldn’t be
done."

ELAINE VIETS

 

A Llama That Horns In On Christmas

HIS story started with an anon-

ymous letter. It said: “Ted has a
llama. Gary has a beer belly. Each
year in December they dress the
llama like a reindeer and Gary like
Santa Ciaus and go around the
neighborhood visiting little kids be-
fore Christmas.”

Ted Bradshaw really does have a
'llama. Somehow, he convinced it to
wear reindeer horns.

His friend Gary Honerkamp does
dress like Santa. But Gary doesn’t
really have a beer gut. As Santas go,
he’s quite slender.

It all started five years ago in De-
cember. That’s when Ted’s daugh-
ter, Wendy, wanted a big dog.

“I mean really big,” he said. “Like
a Newfoundland. We couldn’t find
anything she liked. Then I saw this
ad in the Post-Dispatch. It said, ‘Lla-
mas for sale.‘ "

They‘re big. Ted‘s llama weighs
about 300 pounds. “I bought it from
a man in Ellisville.

“I told Gary. ‘You can’t believe
what I got — a llama.’

“Gary blurted on”. ’Fern .ndoi
You've. got to call it Fernando "

And so Fernando Liﬁfiid came to
Ted‘s house in Eureka.

“Then a neighbor asked a
friend to dress up as Santa Claus for
their kids. Santa got sick. The neigh-
bor asked if I would be Santa. I said
yes. Then I remembered Gary. I
said he’d be even better. He has a
red nose and he's big.

“Someone said, ‘Why don’t you
make antlers out of cardboard
tubes? We can make Fernando a
reindeer and surprise the heck out
of everyone."

Gary said. “We went over to the
neighbor’s house. When their little
girl saw Santa and the reindeer, she
was so excited. Her feet never
touched the ground.

“I stood by the Christmas tree.
The llama was outside. You could
see him through the window. With
the moonlight in back of him, he
really looked like a reindeer.”

I’d never believe it, if I didn’t see
it myself. The moonlight softens
Fernando’s lumpy llama shape and
makes him into a svelte reindeer.

“It‘s magic," Gary said.

“It was such a good night,” Ted
said. “we decided to do more. We
called other neighbors to see if their
kids were home. Then we walked
over.

“The next year, we found that
Fernando would go into cars. He
folds up like a card table.”

“We also called parents and found
out what gifts the kids were getting,"
Gary said. “Then I could say, ‘And if

Gary Honerkamp, suited up as Santa,

h

you’re good, I’ll bring you a train.’ It
helped my credibility.”

There were other improvements.
The first year, Ted held on Fernan-
do’s cardboard antlers. Now the lla-
ma wears felt antlers. Kathy Brad-
shaw sewed them to his halter.

Fernando still doesn’t have a red
nose. “We’re afraid he'll knock it off
and send some little kid into shock,”
Ted said.

Fernando does more than pose‘

outside windows now. “The kids can
come out and feed Fernando vanilla
wafers and peppermint sticks. Fer-
nando will eat anything.”

Fernando proved this statement-
, by munching the holly centerpiece

in the dining room.

0n duty, Fernando does not go L

into homes. He stays on the porch or
in the driveway. Ted stands by as

 

the reindeer handler.

Ted had a close call one night.
“One little boy wanted to see the
rest of the reindeer and the sleigh.
That’s all he needed was to see me
and Fernando getting into a van.
Fortunately, his father told him if
he ran back inside, he could hear
the reindeer on the roof.”

Llamas are supposed to be
evil-tempered and like to spit. But
Fernando is surprisingly gentle. He
wandered around the Bradshaw
house like a big dog. The baby,
Meghan, walked under Fernando’s
legs.

“Fernando loves short people,”
Ted said. “Llamas have a pecking
order. The biggest llama is the boss.
So they prefer little people. They
are nice, docile animals. They don’t
bark, but they do hum."

Along with Fernando, Ted has a

“One Christmas, my wife, Kathy,
was 7 months pregnant,” Ted said.
“I tried to get her to dress up and
ride the donkey over to the local
Holiday Inn.”
No

“That’s what Kathy said. I wanted
to ask if there was any room at the
inn.”

So how do you get Santa and Fer-

Pit bull
killed by
Mesa man

Dog terrorized
family in home

By Kerry Fehr
Arizona Republic Correspondent

A pit bullterrier burst into a Mesa
home Monday morning and terror-
ized its occupants, one of whom
managed to kill the dog with a
butcher knife after it had locked its
jaws around the family cat.

Maureen Tomko, 31, said her
husband, Donald, 31, suffered 4O
puncture wounds in his hands and a
chipped bone in his left thumb
during the attack.

“My husband is hurting so
severely right now,” she said. “His
hands are still bleeding and oozing.
They weren‘t able to stitch his hands
because the wounds are so deep.“

Donald Tomko was leaving his
home in the 4200 block of East
Adobe Street for work at about 6
am. when the pit bull charged the
front door, knocking it open, Mau-
reen Tomko said.

She said the dog ran into the
couple’s bedroom and knocked her
over as she sat up in bed.

“The dog was extremely strong,”
she said. “He probably weighed 50
to 60 pounds.”

The pit bull chased the family cat.
Charlie, a 6-year-old Siamese, out of
the bedroom and cornered him in
the kitchen, grabbing him in its jaws,
Maureen Tomko said.

“His mouth was locked shut on
our cat, and my husband couldn’t
pry its jaws open,” she said. “He.
yelled at me to get a butcher knife
and began stabbing it until it finally
let go.”

Donald Tomko said he stabbed
the dog six or seven times with the
7-inch knife.

“It was really gruesome," he said.
“The dog was so muscular it bent
the butcher knife completely back-
ward. It could have killed one of my
kids.”

The couple’s 4-year-old son,
Greg. woke up as the struggle ended
and saw the mutilated dog in the
family’s kitchen, Maureen Tomko

said.

“He was shocked, so I hurried
him away," she said. “I hope he is
not traumatized b}. the whole
thing."

The cat suffered back-muscle
injuries, she said.

The body of the dog, a 2-year-old
Staffordshire terrier named Spud, is
being examined to determine
whether the animal was rabid.

The dog’s owner. Wallace Todd

Schafer of the 4200 block of East
Adobe Street, may face criminal
charges in the attack, said Sgt. Mike
Hayes, a spokesman for the Mesa
Police Department.

Schafer could not be reached for
comment.

Hayes said Schafer was cited by
the department’s animal~control di-
vision on Dec. 13, 1987. for letting
the pit bull run loose.

Donald Tomko, a maintenance

 

worker for Bashas’, said he spent
$300 at Mesa Lutheran Hospital on
Monday and $122 to have his cat
treated by a veterinarian. He also
said he will miss at least a week of
work.

Maureen Tomko said that her
husband and she plan to sue Schafer.

“The whole thing has really been
devastating for us,“ she said. “I‘m
paranoid now. When I see a dog.
any dog, I cringe.”

Slob gunners
invade woods

trespassers.

Lovettsville, Va.

very 30 or so yards along a

E country lane leading to the

east slope of Short Hill Moun-

tain, metal signs are nailed to trees:

“POSITIVELY NO HUNTING.”
“NO TRESPASSING.”

Every deer-hunting season, which
in Virginia runs from mid-November
to early January, signs are posted by
local property owners. And every
season, gunners, hot for the ecstasy of
pumping bullets into deer, ignore
them. Or tear them down. Or shoot
through them.

On this Saturday afternoon in
northwest Virginia, the war against
wildlife rages. Cracks of gunfire
shatter the woodland stillness. Deer
are being “taken” or “harvested,” the
preferred euphemisms for slaughter.
At a counting station in Lovettsville, a
rural village trying to stay that way, a
game official reports that in the ﬁrst
week of the season more than 90 deer
were brought in.

What’s also large is the resolve of a
Lovettsville property owner to prevent
his 200 acres of woodland and pasture
from becoming a combat zone. The
owner, who has lived and farmed in
the area for 10 years, has placed about
100 signs along the perimeter of his
property. His letters to local and state
game officials asking for protection
against illegal gunners get sympathetic
but ineffective replies.

The story of this property owner’s
ordeal is an account of life among
armed trespassers. With good reason,
considering the trigger-happy crowd
that invades his land, the owner
requests anonymity.

Hunting writers portrayed their
co-religionists as models of nature-lov-
ing reSponsibility who brave the
elements in man’s eternal and tran-
scendental quest to tame the frontier.
Tales of cameraderie are spun, fellow-
ships of courage in which creatures
from deer to doves are stalked as if
they were as menacing as jungle
jaguars.

The property owner, who handled
high-powered rifles as an Army
infantry officer and who served in
Vietnam, says, “There is more boom-

This property owner’s ordeal is an
account of life among armed

boom on my property at the start of
the hunting season than I heard on an
average day in Saigon in 1968. If I
want to risk a family stroll in our
woods, I’ve got to go to the expense of
dressing us all up in blaze-orange
suits, and even then we are literally
taking our lives in our hands.”

In 10 years, slob gunners have
treated these 200 acres as a garbage
dump, he says. In addition to beer
cans, styrofoam cups, Pringle’s tubes
and spent chewing tobacco pouches,
deer entrails are routinely left behind.

“They nearly always resist a
request to leave,” the owner says.
“They offer a song and 'dance to
justify the hunt. Typical comebacks
are these: ‘I’m just doing you a favor,
deer can be dangerous.’ Or ‘thinning
out the herd prevents deer starvation.’
Or ‘deer eat your vegetation.’ Or ‘the
deer will probably get killed on the
highway anyway, so what‘s the
difference.’ And the standby, ‘I’ve
always hunted here, way back when
with my daddy.’ The more belligerent,
emboldened perhaps by the loaded
weapons in the crook of their arms,
and the knife at their belt, often insist
on knowing why you’re against
hunting if you eat hamburger or wear
leather shoes.”

Like the white tails of the deer they
decimate, defensiveness is a marking
common to woodland animal killers.
Instead of candid admissions that they
take pleasure in dealing out death to
the defenseless, the modern deerslayer
defends the bloodletting as a public
service.

Wayne Pacelle, director of the The
Fund For Animals, estimates that
white-tailed deer, mule deer and elk
represent less than 2 percent of the
national annual slaughter: “The 50
million mourning doves, 15 million
waterfowl and other migratory birds
killed by hunters last year were not
shot for their own good. Nor were 20
million quail, 15 million pheasants, 32
million rabbits, 29 million squirrels or
20,000 black bears. Add to that the
undetermined millions of animals
purposefully stocked and shot on
private shooting preserves and it is a
staggering toll of animal misery.

Huntng is done for fun, not because

3 hunters have no other food choices

and not because animals have no
better fate than to be shot.”

On these 200 posted acres in
Lovettsville, the right to fun overrides

Red paint was splashed over a
Sign at I. Ringler Furs, 310 St. Paul
St., and on the front of Evans Furs,

or early Monday. ‘

Tom Riley, vice president of the
Fur Retailers Information Council,
said, “It appears that the vandal-
ism and the violence of the animal
rights movement is unfortunately
escalating dramatically this season
over last. We are finding that a

splashed with red paint around the
country.”

Irv Ringler, proprietor of I. Rin-
gler Furs, said a customer first no-
ticed the vandalized sign about 11
am. Monday.

“It looks like somebody came by
and threw a bucket of paint on it,”
he said.

While not attributing the vandal—
ism to any organized animal rights
group, Ringler said he thinks their
activities attract extremists who
might do such things on their own.

A demonstration by animal
rights groups was held in the Cher-
ry Creek area just after Thanks-
giving.

Robin Duxbury, director of the

led that protest.

Monday, she responded to Riley
and Ringler by saying, “I firmly
believe that the f urriers are perpe—
trating this against themselves in
order to discredit the whole animal
rights movement. It’s been done
before, and I figured it was just a
matter of time before somebody
here in Denver tried it.”

She said she was annoyed.

“They’re starting to get desper-
ate. Fur sale profits are down re-
gardless of what they’re saying.
They have been trying, scrambling
for quite some time now, to dis-
credit the animal rights move-
ment.”

TOURISTS ENJOY
WILDLIFE SPECTACLE

Dusk falls. The ﬁerce African heat still lingers in the
air around a game lodge at the isolated northerly
Samburu national park.

Visitors have washed away caked dust from
bumpy bush rides in 4x4 drive vehicles and sip a cock-
tail before enjoying a cook-out dinner. They gaze across
the silent waters of the Vasa Ngiro river, spotting an

alligator basking, then a leopard tearing at morsels left by lodge staff on the
opposite river bank.

The guest logbook shows the tourists have spotted and photographed lion,
cheetah, elephant, giraffe, oryx, zebra and a dOZen other species. This is the
timeless Kenya of stillness, rugged beauty, dramatic variety and majestic wildlife.
Visitors are willing to travel half a world to be thrilled for years afterwards by
memories of Africa.

Few realize the idyll is threatened by an erosion of wildlife’s natural
habitats from new settlements, drought and most ominously poachers.

The conservation issue has become a major topic both at international
level and in Kenya where the government and society believe crisis point has
been reached.

Finance Minister Professor George Saitoti says bleakly: “Poaching must
be stamped out to save our animals’.’

Conservation Policies

The government in an effort to stop poachers has recently announced
\g the suspension of all mining and prospecting in game
ii reserves. President Moi has also authorized a shoot on sight
policy following the murder of three rangers by ivory
poachers in Kora national reserve.
The problem particularly concerns the black rhino,
I whose numbers have declined in eight years from 1,500
i to 500. Thousands of elephant have died from starvation
5' or been slaughtered In the past 15 years. Elephant numbers
in Kenya are now put at 24,000 by Dr Perez 0lindo, director of Kenya’s
Wildlife Conservation & Management Department. But the real point, he says,
is not numbers but their rate of decline.

Throughout Africa the elephant has been in decline for 100 years.
Elephants, says Dr 0lindo, can wander hundreds of miles and the biggest reason
for their falling numbers has been habitat destruction and a reduction of their
rangeland. There is no easy solution while the poachers are at large. Success has,
however, been achieved in increasing the numbers of rhino, a more territorial
minded species which can be protected in sanctuaries. “We have had problems’,’
Dr 0lindo admits, “but they are not as acute or as bad as others in Africa. 0ur
relative stability accounts in part for our better record’.’ Dr 0lindo was awarded
the 1988 J Paul Getty Wildlife Conservation Prize but wildlife conservation is
taken seriously by all Kenyans.

Michael Werikhe has made it a personal crusade to help foster
‘ worldwide interest in preserving wildlife, particularly the
rhino. In September, Werikhe, a 32-year-old security
supervisor in Mombassa, completed a 2,800 kilometer
walk from Assisi in Italy to England in what he described
as “a silent demonstration to the world that we in Kenya
are not as destructive and see wildlife issues in the same
way as others’.’
' 1 Softly spoken Werikhe has a powerful message for
those willing to listen. “The problem facing the rhino In Africa Is a global
one. World support is needed. Nature belongs to all of us and we need
collectively to take care of it’,’ he says.

Alerting young Kenyans to the conservation challenge is important and
more than 1,000 wildlife clubs exist in Kenyan schools.

At Mount Kenya Game Ranch’s animal orphanage the head keeper Nelson
Muhoro and his colleagues care for a wide range of animals rescued from the
widl and also have Africa’s only captive breeding herd of bongo antelope.
Nearby the William Holden Wildlife Education Center has been established.
with prestigious US patronage, to provide study and accommodation places
for school children and their teachers in memory of the late American actor.

It is a development which will help the youth of Kenya, who have enjoyed
the fruits of independence, to appreciate both their rich heritage as well as
responsibilities towards threatened species.

ARIZONA REPUBLIC - Phoenix — December 18, 1988

Tiny zoo monkey stolen,

imperiled by diet needs

By Chuck Hawley
The Arizona Republic

A tiny monkey listed among the
world’s endangered species was stolen
from the Phoenix Zoo on Friday night
or Saturday morning and is likely to
die if not returned soon.

Zoo curator Reg Hoyt said the
male of a pair of cottontop tamarin
monkeys was discovered missing
about 7:30 am. Saturday by ‘zoo
keeper Cindy Topp.

The welded-wire screening of the
animal’s enclosure had been severed
with wire cutters, Hoyt said. The
female of the breeding pair remained
in the enclosure, which is in the

southwestern corner of the zoo.

The monkey weighs less than 2
pounds and is about half the size of a
Capuehin monkey, the stereotypical
organ grinder’s helper. ~

“They look like a little old man
with a black, hairless face and a
sweeping shock of white hair like
Albert Einstein’s,” Hoyt said. “Their
appearance is quite distinctive.”

The stolen monkey could be in
danger because it needs a special diet
to survive.

“Unfortunately, they have very
specific diet requirements when they

are in captivity, and it is unlikely that '

— 100, from page BI

somebody would be able to continue
that in their home,“ Hoyt said.

The cottontOp tamarin is native to
Brazilian rain forests and is listed as
an endangered species because of
systematic destruction of its habitat
through logging and agricultural de-

' velopment in central Brazil.

Little is known of their wild
gpbpulation because of their elusive
feature and tiny size, but. about 250 are

in captivity and appear to mate for
life, he said.

“The female (of the pair) is visibly
distressed about the loss of the male,”
Hoyt said.

“She’s crying and making a lot of
noise in her enclosure today.”

The pair, acquired about a year
ago, have bred successfully and de-
livered twins about two weeks ago, he
said, but, “unfortunately, we lost both
of them because of maternal neglect.”

“We were hOpeful that we were on
the road to a successful breeding
program until this happened,” he said.

Hoyt said tamarins have been
domesticated in the past, but not
successfully.

The diminutive tamarin also can

deliver a nasty bite, he said.

“They may be small, but you get
one on the end of your ﬁnger or your
nose, and you’ve got a ﬁght on your .
hands,” Hoyt said.

He said the black-market value of
the tamarin may be as high as $1,000.
Trading in endangered species is
prohibited by federal law.

The theft has been reported to
Phoenix police.

allows return to owners

By Anthony So‘mmer
Phoenix Gazette

Charlie theApe has cheated
the executioner but he’ll have to
spend the rest of his life behind
bars. '

Despite the fact Charlie
mauled a 3-year-old Phoenix boy
Oct. 7, Maricopa County Superior
Court Judge Pro Tem Mark
Kalish ruled Monday that the
county attorney’s office failed to
prove Charlie has a "propensity”
for unprovoked attacks on hu-
man beings.

Charlie, a Celesus ape who has
been in custody at the county
pound since the attack, will be
returned to his owners, Gene and
Reva Jean Jones of Williams.
They have agreed to have him
defanged .and permanently kept

‘ in a cage on their 40-acre home.

They also agreed not to allow
Charlie near other people.

. » Charlie attacked Mark Bisner
‘Jr."0ct. '7, biting him on his right

hand, arm, chest and both legs.
The bites required more than 90

stitches is t i as?

The 'youngster’s father, Marl:
Eisner Sr., who has been a friend
of the Jones family for 15 years,
said his son has recovered but
has some scars.

Bisner said Mark has night-
mares but they involve his fear of
hospitals rather than the attack.

According to witnesses at Mon«
day’s hearing, young Mark was
asleep on a couch at his west
Phoenix home, where Mrs. Jones
and the ape were visiting at the
time of the attack.

Witnesses said Charlie was
"grooming” the youngster and
Mark turned over in his sleep,
hitting Charlie with his arm.

Charlie responded by biting
Mark in the hand and, when
Mark’s mother and cousin began
screaming, he dragged the still-
sleeping child off the sofa and hit
him several more times before
Mrs. Jones, who was in another
room, could pull him off.

The elder Bisner said after the

See IApe, 8.2

U

judge’s decision that he has remained friendly with
the Jones family and was pleased the ape was not
_ ordered destroyed and will be kept away from
people.

"It was an unfortunate incident,” Bisner said.
"Charlie is not a wild or dangerous animal.”

Mrs. Jones said that she, not the ape, was
responsible for the injuries to the youngster.

"I feel it was my fault because I didn’t know
enough about the animal,” she said. ’

She had testiﬁed that the dealer who sold
Charlie. had assured her Celesus apes are not
aggressrve and become more docile as they become
Elder, which she said she has since learned is not

rue.

"It’s always traumatic when a child is hurt,”
Mrs. Jones said. "I would rather have taken the
bites myself instead of the baby.

"I’ll keep him in a cage, and I’ll keep him away
from everybody.”

Kal'ish said that although there was no doubt
Charlie had attacked the boy with very little
provocation. state law requires an animal be

shown to have a history of unprovoked attacks
beforeoa Judge can order the animal destroyed.

Assrstant County Attorney Michael Law called
several former neighbors of the Jones family, who
lived in west Phoenix before moving to Williams
earlier this year. ‘

.Several testiﬁed Charlie had broken loose and
chgbed into their yards where he chased their
pe .
.Two of the neighbors said they received minor
bites from Charlie, but Kalish found Charlie was
provoked in each case.

In one incident, a neighbor testified she found
Charlie in her yard, grabbed his leash and swung
him around in circles completely off the ground
before he hit her, causing a small puncture wound
behind her right knee.

Charlie, who is about 4 years old, is fully grown,
about 3 feet tall and weighs about 60 pounds.

Celesus apes are not true apes but a member of
the Macaque family of tail-less monkeys. They live
in the wild in New Guinea and have a normal life
span of about 40 years, he said.

j’ spaces with ' cement ﬂoors cov-
ered with fecal matter -+ as were
the poor dogs. One puppy room
was crammed with plastic milk
crates filled with puppies about
to be shipped to various pet shop
outlets.

The crew ﬁlmed at another
mill at the end of a dirt road.
This Kansas farm raised a variety
of dogs. Huskies were caged in
old, broken—down refrigerators
with runs that had not been
cleaned in months. Airedales in
another part of the farm were
kept in cages covered with fecal
matter and waste. Many of the
dogs’ water bowls were empty
despite the heat.

The facilities the TV crew vis-
ited represent only a small sam-
pling of the thousands ’of- puppy
mills throughout Kansas and a
somewhat delicate sampling of
the true horrors endemic to such
places. As a result of the ﬁlms,
some progress has been made on
inspections of Kansas puppy
mills. More than that, Kansas has
passed legislation that requires
semiannual inspections and reg-
istration of commercial breeders
and kennels. If properly en—
forced, the action could be a ma-
jor step in the right direction.

Pet shops (many of which are
national chains) have been com-
pletely aware of puppy mill con—
ditions. But they have been more
aware of proﬁts. A puppy that
they buy from one of these mills
for $50 to $75 may be sold for up
to $400.

I would still urge potential
owners to avoid buying a pup
from a pet shop. Boycotting such
shops will hurt the puppy mill
and 'pet shop industry and thus
reduce the cruelty and harm per-
petrated on their “wares.” The
simple and intelligent, alternative
is to go to a reputable private .
breeder. If .‘y0u live in a large city
and don’t know where to locate
one, , contact a local veterinarian

auaggxﬁpunoy j

7 About four years ago I wrote
about the potential horrors of
most puppy mills and their sor-
did links to pet shops.

3 I recently checked with the
Humane Society of the United
States and was informed that
puppy mills and pet shops have
continued with “business as usu-
31.”

Last summer investigative re-.
porter Jeff Cole of Hartford,
Conn, and his ﬁlm crew went to
Kansas, 3 state notorious for its
numerous puppy mills — more
than 2,400. Cole and the camera
crew made their ﬁrst stop at a
small puppy mill near the Okla-
homa border. Before being
chased off the premises, they
were able to ﬁlm some of the
horrid conditions.

- “Beagles were being raised at
. the site in chicken cages raised 3
to 4 feet off the ground. The
flooring of each cage was also
chicken wire so that fecal matter
would drop to the ground. Some
of the cages were covered with
old blankets, while others had
nothing for protection.

The crew then headed for To-
,‘peka, checking out the many
puppy mills in almost every

' small community along the way.
Conditions were unspeakably
bad at practically every stop they
made. And this is where pet
shops get their “wares.”

The crew stopped at one large,
notorious mill, Prairie Winds
Kennels. The facility had been
closed for unsanitary and inhu~
mane conditions but was again in
business. This mill was compara-
tively “big business.” Not only
did the owner breed puppies but
also acted as a broker for smaller. .

Cole, the owner, a local politi-

Animal stories '

All freedoms in a zoo
are relative

 

By Michelle Genz

 

he rats wouldn’t have been so bad had they been dry.

A dry rat doesn’t look much different from a mouse,

and I’ve never been squeamish about animals. But a

wet brown rat, that was a challenge, especially at 7 in

the morning, when a night’s worth of bear mess lay
foul on the ﬂoor of the cage. I was always seeing two or
three scurry into the drainage holes when I put the hose on
high power. I could imagine them loving it in there, in the
heat of the day of a Florida summer, the cool wet concrete,
the darkness, thanking me for blasting the rest of it in
behind them, leftover rotting lettuce and orange rinds and
monkey chow.

Not that the director of parks knew anything about the
rats when he told me he didn’t want to hire me. I wasn’t
the first woman to work at this zoo, but he wanted my
predecessor to be the last. “Well, I’ll tell you,” he said to
me, leaning back in his chair and smiling. “I have a
daughter myself,” he said, and I was getting hopeful. He
had let me go on and on, about how much I loved animals,
how badly I wanted to work outside, how I was saving
money for my trip to France in the fall.

But then I started thinking he was just enjoying himself,
sitting there in the nice cool office listening to this college
girl, a nice change for a man in his line of work. And then
with no let—up in his endless easy grin, he said, “You know,
I just don’t like seeing women push wheelbarrows around.”
It took a minute, it took a few protests, and he stopped
enjoying himself. Then I knew what he meant, and I
realized this is what it means to have to fight City Hall.

But it wasn’t much of a. ﬁght. One phone call to the city
manager, and I was a Maintenance Man 1.

Working in a zoo was a way to compensate for beinga
sort of girlish girl, the kind who closes her eyes when
someone throws a ball. My only claim to tomboyism was a
tough stomach and my lack of fear of animals.

And it was a wonderful job. The mannish accoutremcnts
did for me what football shoulder pads do for a skinny boy.
There were enormous steel—toed boots that put a swagger in
my walk; I wore khaki pants and boy’s department shirts,
and when a coatimundi bit me the first day on the job I
drove myself to the emergency room through downtown
traffic in a dump truck.

After a while, I ﬁgured out that of the duties of a
Maintenance Man I, hosing the cages was the dregs. Like
my male counterparts, I discovered I could kill a whole
afternoon sweeping the boardwalks of the Nature Trail.
Now and then I’d see the ranger sitting on a bench
somewhere, his horse untethered beside him, pretending to
have some duty to perform simply by being there. He never
shared his ﬂask with me as he had with the other girls. I
think he knew I hated him for thumping Charlie the
chimp’s manhood whenever he stuck it out the bars of the
cage. It was something Charlie did whenever women came
around, and I still believe he associated the thumping with a
woman’s presence, and his nasty behavior was a way of

retaliating.

 

Rats. We looked around. There were
dozens there, in freedom on top of
the chain link fence.

But he was friendly to men, certain men anyway. Once he
escaped, and within minutes he jumped full-front into the
arms of a friend of mine, a pensive Buddhist chess
champion who happened to be sitting on a bench reading.
They embraced for a while—my friend was completely
stunned of course—then Charlie took off for the depths of
the trail. By nightfall, they were tossing nets into the trees
to try to get Charlie down. Finally it took my co-
workerwith Cherokee blood, to use his Indian wisdom of
the wildemess to coax Charlie down, and the chimp held
his hand back to the truck.

The workers had their misogynist antics, too. They tried
everything to make me ﬂinch. For example, they got the
parrots saying such vulgar things they had to be banished to
a shed out of earshot of the public.

But that was all good—natured, and I stuck it out, happy
in my regimen, with high points in my day, like feeding the
spider monkeys who rode one on each foot, hugging my
boots, begging for love. Or the bits of bravura, like dousing
antibiotic powder on the bear’s chafed bottom, or throwing
fryers to the alligators from inside their fence:

But the stint was drawing to a close; it was time to
compose myself, to put on something civilized and go to
France for a year. My notice was almost up. Late one, night,
a friend and I were driving past a remote section of the
trail, and we saw that a portion of the fence had been bent
down, probably by local children sneaking in without
paying. We parked on a side street, hopped easily over the
fence, and got our bearings in the darkness. There was a
thrilling mystery to the trail so familiar, even though it was
clear in the moonlight, and in the end, we found our way.
But it made us skittish: animals at night had a command of
the turf that our feeble senses couldn’t begin to match. A
possum rustling in a palmetto had us clutching one another,
and we crouched in reﬂex when an owl swooped low before
us, pounding the blackness and crashing through brush with
stunning mass and velocity. For a long time, we stayed
there, listening, adjusting. We started Walking, and came
into view of the dark cages; shadows of hunched baboons
and pacing foxes, raccoons staring from the top of their tree
trilled in curiosity.

It was as though we were looking through a camera lens,
and suddenly we pulled back, changed our focus to this side
of the cages. Standing in relief against the bars, we saw
then, still, and on display like the rest, but free. Rats. We
looked around. There were dozens there, in freedom on top
of the chain link fence; no, hundreds, everywhere, on all the
fences, around every cage. Still, and proud, and holding
their ground in liberty, huge rats that were undaunted at
our presence, unashamed. Armed with nothing more than
their own repugnance, they guarded their precious fortress
of rotten food and dung, staking their claim now, gorging
themselves before the assault of the morning hoses.

We were surrounded. Gingerly we backed away, out of
the zoo, mto the woods, over the fence and home.

By the light of day, the rats were gone from my mind. I
went to work as usual and I knew better than to look too
closely in the palmettos, or under foundations, or behind
the benches. And when I saw one, in the bear cage as usual.
I turned my hose the other way, out of some new deference
to these creatures; they were free, after all, to do as they
pleased, freer than these animals we had chosen for display,
and therefore more noble, no matter how disgusting their
work seemed to me.

As always, the rat went into the drain hole on his own.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - Dec. 10, 1988

Canada Geese

Wear Out WelCome I

_ Associated Press
Boston
The graceful sight of Canada geese slicing

through the sky in their “V” formation has be-
come a foreboding sight in the Northeast.

“They’re very pretty to look at. Unfortunately they
leave problems behind,” says Elaine Moore, a seiectman
,in the town of Stoneham where police on horseback
conducted daily goose roundups this spring.

~ In Stoneham, like many other towns across the
region, the birds were welcomed when they started
ﬂuttering in about six years ago.

“They would cross Main Street and you would see
the mother and the little goslings behind her. The
traffic would stop and let these sweet little things go
iac‘ross the street,” Moore said.

, f‘" The welcome soon wore out as the birds chewed up
golf courses, lawns and landscaped office parks, leaving
behind liberal smatterings of their pungent calling
cards.

, , Over the past six years more and more geese have
:appeared in the Northeast, with more birds stopping
short in their journey south. Homegrown flocks also
Shave grown.

A Canadian expert on the wild geese said one
reason for the upsurge in local gaggles is the creation of
ideal breeding grounds in parks and on golf courses:
.iareas of short, fertilized grass surrounding a body of
water.

,, “If you wanted to make a place for geese, you could

not do better than that,” said Harry Lumsden, who
'worked for 40 years for Canada’s Ministry of Natural
Resources in Ontario and now is a private consultant.

“We make the mistake of allowing the geese to get
.- the idea that this park or this golf course is a nice safe
place with good food,” he said.

' In Stoneham, a town of 23,000 about 10 miles north
. of Boston, residents complained of being kept awake by
the honking and had to shoo birds from their lawns
with brooms. The town reservoir was clogged with
droppings and police resorted to horseback roundups
in May to corral the birds at a downtown intersection,

' Moore said.

George Haas, migratory bird specialist at the US.

' Fish and Wildlife Service’s Boston office, said geese can
, be found along the coast from Maine to Florida, but the
highest concentrations are from Maryland northward.

. Winter population inventories from last year show-
ed 76,900 in New York, 90,200 in New Jersey, 6,900 in
’Connecticut and 13,600 in Massachusetts, Haas said.
Federal officials are not able to determine exactly
which geese are migrating and which have settled in a

' state, he said.

The federally protected birds face few predators
and are smart enough to outwit many hunters during
the limited season, he said.

Several states have implemented hunting seeiSons.
Haas said. In Massachusetts, about 3,000 birds were

” bagged in an experimental season last year.

One of the more innovative goose-control methods
is the SS Bytex, a radio-controlled miniature boat. The
boat has been in action since last spring, buzzing
around a pond at Bytex Corp. in Southborough to scare
off geese, said owner and self-styled “goosebuster” Nor-
man Heifetz.

Ludeen said farmers in Ontario can apply for

its to kill nuisance birds, but scaring the birds

away from prime grazing grounds with constant noise-
makers is usually the most effective method.

“Get after those birds in mid~May and don‘t give

, theme moment’s peace," hr; advised.

Owl to Get Rereview
as Endangered Bird

Acting on a petition filed by more
than 25 environmental groups. a federal
judge in Seattle has ordered the US.
Fish and Wildlife Service to reevaluate
the status of the northern spotted owl for
possible inclusion on the federal endan-
gered species list.

The bird, believed by many to be
facing extinction, relies on a diminish-
ing habitat of old-growth forest —— trees
at least 200 years old — in the Pacific
Northwest. Listing the owl as an endan—
gered species would reduce or terminate
logging of the remaining old-growth
trees. an action the timber industry
claims would cost it $150 million a year.

Last December, the Fish and Wild-
life Service concluded that an abundant
number of owls existed —— about 5,000
—— and could survive in new—growth for-
ests. The environmental groups. rep-
resented by the Sierra Club Legal De-
fense Fund Inc., sued the agency in

May. contending that it had misinter-
' preted the data.

US. District Judge Thomas S. .123,
agreed that the service “disregarded all
expert opinion on population viability.
including that of its own expert. that the
owl is facing extinction.” Under Zilly's
order, the service has 90 days to review
its decision and provide a credible ratio—
nale for not listing the owl.

"Curb on Hunting Urged

 

HERMON, Me. —— Karen Wood went
to the backyard of her house at the
edge of dense woods in this northern
Maine town one afternoon last month,
apparently to ask hunters to back off
from the area around her preperty. She
never had the chance.

A hunter in the vicinity, who later
said he saw a deer in the scope of his
high-powered rifle, fired two shots. He
said he walked ahead looking for the

 

deer and instead found Mrs. Wood, who
died at the scene of a single gunshot
wound to the chest.

The hunter, Donald Rogerson, was
charged with manslaughter in the
death of Mrs. Wood. A grand jury de-
clined to indict him. But the shooting of
Mrs. Wood, a 37-year-old mother of
l—year-old twins, has renewed the de-
bate over whether tougher rules should
be enacted on the sport, a pastime
deeply rooted in the history of this
largely rural state.

Hunting Is Big Business
Hunting in Maine is big business for
guides, sporting camp owners and out-
fitters, among others. It brings about
$6 million to the State Department of

Tlnland Fisheries and Wildlife for li-

censes. In 1987, 160,000 of Maine’s one
million residents and 33,000 out-0f-
staters bought hunting licenses.

As development has moved inland
from coastal Maine, and rural areas
have become settled, the friction be-
tween hunters and non-hunters has in-
creased. Some Mainers, including
some who hunt, are pressing for laws
increasing the size of no—hunting zones
around homes, prohibiting the use of
some high-caliber weapons in settled
areas and requiring hunters to carry li-
ability insurance and pass periodic
safetytests. .

Mr. Rogerson, the hunter who shot
Mrs. Wood, has suggested that mark-
ers be placed in the woods to warn
hunters they are near houses.

“1 had no clue there was a house
around,” he said in an interview. “It
was a terrible accident, and I hope
something can be done .to prevent this
type of accident from ever happening
again.”

Mr. Rogerson, who is 45 years old,
said he had been hunting since he was
10 but would never hunt again.

Thinking Twice Before Going Out

Advocates for more regulations said
that with such precautions, Mrs. Wood
might not have been killed on Nov. 15.
Mrs. Wood and her husband, Kevin,
had just moved into a house in a new
subdivision in this town of 3,100 people
west of Bangor. In a letter to the editor
of The Bangor Daily News, Mr. Wood
said his wife was standing about 130
feet from the rear of the house when
she was shot.

Mr. Wood, who is a psychologist in

 

Bangor, declined to be interviewed. His

 

After Shooting in Maine

lawyer, Frederick Badger, said he ex-
pected to file suit against Mr. Roger-
son, alleging wrongful death, within
weeks.

Residents of some of Maine’s more
rural areas say they think twice before
leaving their houses in the monthlong
hunting season each November.

“I do a good deal of walking and I
don’t dare to during hunting season,"
said Shirley Nason, who lives at Se-
boeis Plantation, a settlement of seven
homes about 50 miles north of Bangor.
“Toward the edge of dusk, they’ll shoot
at anything.”

Mrs. Nason said that a hunter once.
pointed his gun at her when she told
him to leave her property and that
hunters had left three bullet holes in
the side of her house. Her neighbor has
a bullet lodged in his dining room table,
she said.

State law prohibits hunting within

 

The hunter said
he saw a deer; a
woman died.

 

100 yards of a dwelling. Mrs. Nason
says that is not far enough, and hunters
say a bullet from a deer rifle can travel
a mile.

‘We’ve Just Got to Be Careful’

Alan H. Smith, a hunter in Blue Hili
Falls, Me, who writes for hunting
magazines, said more. regulation was
not the answer and would have trouble
passing the Maine Legislature.

“Things are changing fast dowr
here,” he said, referring to the influx oi
residents in the area. “We’ve just got
to be careful. It’s just common sense."

Mr. Smith said that what Mrs. Wood
was wearing at the time of the acci
dent, dark clothes and white mittens
might have been a factor. .

“lf she had just had on one piece of
blaze orange,” he said. Hunters in
Maine have been required to wear one
piece of orange clothing since 1967, anc
the regulation appears to have contrib
uted to a decrease in fatalities. Still, ar
average of two people a year are. killec
in deer hunting accidents, according tr
records from the Department of lnlant
Fisheries and Wildlife. ‘

Charles Ledbetter, an Assistant At.
torney General, said of the call for next
regulations: “This is an area fraught
with problems. There is a very strong
constitutionally protected right to hunt
in this state, and we are willing to pu:
up with the risk of injury and deatl
when it comes to hunting.”

‘d last Friday by two men
armed with a pellet gun and a

Police Cmdr. Richard A. Mellem
said Wednesday the incident that
left a trail of blood, feathers and
battered dead ducks sprang from a
misunderstanding that grew out of
the desire to reduce overcrowding

The incident began about 12: 30

one of the shops called police to
complain of two men d13turb1ng “the

Later, after the two men had
gone, police discovered blood and
feathers around the pond. Dead
ducks had been hidden under land-

ered with blood and feathers, had
been discarded in a trash can;

Jeff Steinbach, whom police de-

that Griswold’s periodically has to

that domesticated ducks are not a

cruelty to animals may have oc-

Ken Walton, a game warden for

officials may never be able to locate
the culprits. Beyond that, he said,

there is little evidence. “All I have .

Wrong Priorities
Guiding Protesters
For Animal Rights

A small band of hot-eyed anti-vivisectionists,
burning with holy zeal, staged their umpteenth pro-
test at Emory University’s Yerkes Regional Primate
Research Center this week, and this time they ﬁnally
got what they wanted —— publicity.

The television cameras and newspaper reporters
turned out to watch the 'show while three of the activ-
ists did their own imitation of chimpanzees, swinging
from ropes strung from the tOp of a building.

The protest was a great success. A dozen of the
demonstrators got themselves arrested and, taking a
cue from the anti-abortion crowd, went limp so they
had to be carried to the paddy wagons while the tele-
vision cameras recorded the scene.

.. ~ So, now that they’ve got our attention, what is it
, they really want? *

“We wanted to demonstrate our commitment to
ending research that is
needless, cruel and a

horrendous waste of

DWOOd taxpayers’ money,” said
Mcmister Betsy Swart, national
. 7 coordinator for In De-

, ‘ - fense of Animals, which

organized the
demonstration.

 

“The federal gov-
ernment is now spend-
ing about $500 million
a year on these kinds of
experiments and we
think it’s a waste,” add-
. . ed Ginger Redmon, one
o’f‘those arrested. “We want to start just saying no to
Yerkes.”

_ 3 Theanti-vivisectionists have a right to their opin-

ion and a right to demonstrate. If they choose to get
themselves arrested by pushing the bounds of protest
toofar they ought to be accommodated.

' i-iafut before they get too much aynmathy for their

 

pieas onibehalf of the poor chimps and dogs and oth-'

er animals used in research, it might be wise to get
our priorities straight by hearing from the other side.

2 'Take, for example, the testimony of medical ethi-
cist Carl Cohen of the University of Michigan Medical
School. Writing in the New England Journal of Medi-
cine, he said: .

~“Every disease eliminated, every vaccine devel-
oped, every method of pain relief devised, every sur-
gical procedure invented, every prosthetic device im-
planted 7— indeed, virtually every modern medical
therapy is due, in part or in whole, to experimenta—
tion using animals.” .

‘ .“When balancing the pleasure and pains result- .

ing from the use of animals in research we must not

fail to place on the scales the terrible pains that .

would have resulted, would be suffered now and
would longcontinpe had animals not been used."

', The protestors contend animals are “tortured" in
the name of science but steps taken at Emory and
other research centers indicate otherwise. At Emory,
an Animal Studies Committee monitors the use of an-
imals at the medical school and Yerkes for both re-
search and teaching Scientists conducting longterm
experiments must agree to ‘terminate’ the animal
subject if it shows signs of pain. Analgesic and tran-
quilizing drugs must be used to minimize pain or dis-
tress unless such drugs would interfere with the ex-
periment. Permission to carry out experiments
involving pain without analgesic drugs is permitted
only after careful review by the committee.

-No one wants to see dumb animals suffer need-
lessly. But no one should want to see human beings
suffer needlessly either. Given the choice, I’m on our
side. i: E.

Activists Play Santa Claws, ‘1} 1.
a Happy Ending 1‘0 Lobster T ale

ROCKVILLE, Md. {Ab—Animal
rights activists on Friday spent
$240 to buy seven live lobsters
from a suburban Maryland restau—~
rant and fly them to a. new home off
the coast of Maine.

Cam McQueen of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals
picked up the lobsters from the
House of Chinese Gourmet in
Rockville, took them to Washing-
ton National Airport and boarded a
ﬂight to Portland, Me, a group
official said.

Members of the US. Coast Guard
were to escort her and the lobsters
to a boat station to release the
creatures, spokeswoman Victoria
Thomas said.

The House of Chinese Gourmet is
popular among vegetarians who
were offended when owner Jack
Sun introduced the lobster tank
about a month ago, Thomas said.

“All of the sudden they put up a
125- gallon tank with live lobsters,
and there was a big outcry,” she

said “All their vegetarian Cher-x1e}.
got very upset.”

Sun agreed to get rid of th;
lobster tank, Thomas said, if the
animal activists bought the lobsters
and arranged for their freedom.
The total cost of the lobster rescue
was $240, including the flight. The
Coast Guard donated its services.

Maine is noted for its prime
lobster growing areas. “The water
is cooler, and lobsters prefer that,”
Thomas said.

EULONIA, Ga. — Emmy Minor
wishes children would shoot beer
cans or paper targets, rather than
birds and animals, with the BB
guns and rifles they receive as
Christmas gifts.

One of 151 animal rehabilita-
tors licensed by the state, Mrs. Mi-
nor lives in a 75-year-old log cabin
on a remote stretch of the Georgia
coast and nurses wild birds and
mammals until they are well
enough to be released.

Most of the injured animals
have been accidentally or inten-
tionally hurt by humans. When
she gets them, they are often
bleeding and in great pain. Some-
times they haven’t eaten for days.

“I get sad real often.“ Mrs. Mi-
nor said. “Some humans are just
cruel. They’re cruel to one anoth-
er. They‘re cruel to animals."

more birds and mammals. Each

children who receive air guns and
rifles as Christmas gifts. she said.

“Parents, please. a beer can
[for a target]." she implored in a
recent interview. “[Paper] targets
are cheap and beer cans are
plentiful."

Mrs. Minor soothes the in-
jured animals in the warmth and
quiet of a cardboard box with a
heating pad while they heal.

When the birds have not eaten
for several days, she runs a tube
into their stomachs to feed them a
vitamin supplement. A regular
meal would kill them.

Once the animals are out of
danger, she moves them to large
wire cages near the cabin she
shares with her husband. Al.

Perched in another cage re-

. Officials Hit Snag in Efforts to Save
The Florida Panther From Extinction

 

A Strugle to Save a Species

Georgia and Florida officials have hit a snag in efforts to
save endangered panthers, such as thisone. Three Texas
cougars, released near the Georgia-Florida border to help
determine~ if the habitat is suitable for the panthers, a snmi-
lam speciﬁ, have died. See article, Page 71).

Special to the hurtful-Constitution

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. —— Geor-
gia and Florida officials’ coopera-
tive effort to save endangered
Florida panthers from extinction
has run into serious problems but
will continue, a Florida wildlife
official said this week.

“If people will allow Florida
panthers to exist again, there’s a
real possibility we can prevent
extinction,” said Tom Logan,
chief of the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission’s
wildlife research bureau in Talla-
hassee.

Mr. Logan said wildlife offi-
cials in Florida and Georgia hope
to restock the Okefenokee Swamp
and north Florida’s Osceola Na-
tional Forest with captive-bred
panthers, doubling the panthers’
current range.

But three of five wild Texas
cougars have died after being im-
ported and released to help de-
termine if the South Georgia and
north Florida habitat is suitable
for the panthers, a similar spe-
cies.

Officials suspect humans, not
the new natural environment, are
responsible for two of the deaths.

Mr. Logan said a female cou-
gar died last week of an infection
after being shot in the leg. A male
cougar’s radio collar was found in
October, leading officials to fear
it also was killed.

“The collar had been cut off,
and it would be very unusual to
get that collar off without killing
the animal,” Mr. Logan said.

The third cougar was found
ﬂoating in the Suwannee River in

 

‘If people will allow Florida
panthers to exist again,
there’s a real possibility
we can prevent extinction.’

-,-— Tom Logan

July, dead of unknown causes, he
said.

“We had anticipated losing
some animals, but not so early in

.‘the program. Certainly we hadn’t

expected to have them killed like
this,” Mr. Logan said.

The two surviving cougars, a
male and a female, are ranging
from the release site over a 2,000-
square-mile territory that could
extend into Georgia, Mr. Logan
said. , ‘

The cougars were released on
private land near the Georgia-
Florida border.

Mr. Logan said public outrage

over the killings —— mostly in Flor—
ida —— gives him hope that the

program will ultimately succeed.

“The public is disgusted,” he
said. “People are pretty angry
that one or two people have done
this. The honest sportsmen are
concerned and they don’t want to
be associated with a criminal in
the woods with a gun.” .

According to Mr. Logan, a
$6,000 reward is being offered for
information leading to the indi-
viduals responsible for the cougar
killings.

Reward contributors include

the Florida Game and Fresh Wa-.

ter Fish Commission, the U. S.
Forest Service, the Florida Wild-

life Federation, U.S. Representa-
tive Bill Grant (D-Fla.), and a pri-
vate corporation. 7

“We’re t ing .to get the re-
ward up to 10,000,” Mr. Logan
said. “That makes it pretty lucra—
tive for someone to come forward
with information on the cougars’
deaths.”

Florida panthers once ranged
across the southeastern United
States, but their numbers have
dwindled to a few dozen confined
primarily to the Big Cypress
Swamp and the Everglades in
south Florida, Mr. Logan said.

If the Texas cougar experi-
ment proves the north Florida-
South Georgia habitat is suitable
for panthers, then researchers
plan to release captive- bred ani-
mals in'the areas pioneered by
their Texas cousins, Mr. Logan
said.

He said the cougarsi._released
this summer appeared to be
adapting well to the environment,
aside from the killings.

“The female that died. from
the infection after being shot was
in good health otherWise,” he‘
said. “We’ve been able to gather
very intense data and we’ve’docu-
mented a lot of the kills they’ve
made.” '

_Mr. Logan-said the cougars
were making a kill on the average
of once every nine days, which he
said was normal for the big cats
in the wild.

He said wildlife ofﬁcials are
tentatively planning to release
more wild cougars in north Flori-
da next year in an effort to get the.
program back on track.

Wildlife refuge policies are for i
the birds, environmentalists say;

By Tom Schierholz

Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor

WWW
The way the federal government man-

ages the National Wildlife Refuge system
is, in a sense, discriminatory. Not against
people, against wildlife.

That is the argument of environmental
groups that this week took issue with the
way the US Fish and Wildlife Service
manages the nation’s 450 refuge areas.

A study by the service out this week
recommends continuing the current ref-

uge system management policy.

 

But environmentalists object to the

study, saying current
refuge management fa- ,
vors the preservation '
of game species, even
though such species
may not constitute the

majority of the wildlife population found " ’ "

on a refuge.

.“We must put the needs of wildlife
ﬁrst on our refuges,” says M. Rupert Cut-
ler, president of Defenders of Wildlife.

In the case of waterfowl, over 90 per- 1

cent of the bird populations nesting in
refuge areas are nongame birds. About 7

percent are available to hunters. Still, the ~

group complains, Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice policy puts the interest of the minority
ahead of the majority.

The agency has “no clear or stated
plan for nongame species,” says Kathy
Ibllerton of Defenders.

Duck pepulations A

“cannot long withstand

additional losses from

, illegal harvest,” said

5 Frank Dunkle, director

” of the Fish and Wildlife

Service in announcing the results of the
investigation.

As part of the investigation, oﬂicials
said, undercover Fish and Wildlife Serv- ,
ice agents booked hunts with suspect
guides, payingfrom$65to$500aday for
hunting on private and public lands on
the 112an coast. The investigation cen-

tered on guides who were believed to be
openly encouraging clients to kill water-
fowl illegally.

The alleged violations involved many
species of ducks and“ in several instances,
raptors, herons, and other migratory non-
game birds, ofﬁcials said.” M, .- ,

Environmental groups have offered

advice to the service over the last two
years, but Bill Reﬂalt of the Wilderness
Society says, “Much of what we and other
environmental organizations had said is
being ignored. The document is veriﬁca-
tion of that.”

In addition, Ms. 'lbllerton says, studies
show that nearly 80 percent of visitors to
refuges come for “non-consumptive” pur-

poses— including birdwatching, photog-
raphy, and wildlife appreciation. Visitors

Doggone Merry ChriStInas Cam

LUFKIN, Texas —-— Dec. 25 is more than a week

away, but I’ve already celebrated Christmas in the best

way possible. I owe it all to a friend of mine who had
lost his little brown dog.

' Oh, but he loved his dog, as much as well, he

loved that dog as much as everybody else in the neigh-

borhood hated it _.~"i.nd that’s saying a lot.

This is the that ate the next-door neighbor’s air
conditioner w» i that was on a day when he was on
his best behzi' i He didn’t eat the entire unit. Just
nibbled around the hoses and insulation, that’s all. The
neighbors probably wouldn’t have even noticed that lit-
tle bit, except that it was in the middle of summer and,
as it turns out, an air conditioner won’t come on once
the hoses and insulation are off.

Anyway, one day the dog disappeared, never to re-
turn. (The particular date is now observed in the neigh-
borhbod much as Bastille Day is celebrated in France.)

., My friend ran ads in the newspaper, patroled the
byways and highways of the community, alerted the ani-
mal Shelter to be on the lookout, had the dog’s picture
printed on the back of milkbone cartons, even prayed
about it «- all to no avail. The dog was gone, doggone it.

But from week to week, my friend refused to give
up. Periodically, I would go with him to the animal
shelter, hoping against hope that his little brown dog

might have shown up. .

. Lo and behold, one day it did! It was his dog exact-
ly, except that it was littler, just a puppy, in fact. But
never could I have imagined another dog so much like
the one he had lost —- even down to his black muzzle.

“This is your dog, returned to you as a puppy,” I
told him, excitedly. “You have to take him. It‘s a gift
from God.” '

The little brown dog looked at my friend with its
great sad eyes and wagged its tail. My friend look at the
little brown dog, his eyes even sadder, and shook his
head.

“I can’t,” he said.

G d“You must,” I said. “To do otherwise is to offend
O ‘9!

“I’ll have to take my chances,” he said, choking
back tears. “God will forgive me. My wife never would.”

So it was, I learned, he had promised his wife: If he
couldn’t find his lost dog, he wouldn’t bring home an-
other. To her way of thinking, it was the neighborly
thing to do.

“So be it,” I declared. “But if you won’tadopt this
dog, I will.”

And I did. I marched right into the ofﬁce and filled
out the proper papers. I never so much as blinked

“Thirty—one dollars,” the
formed me. _
“Lend me $31," I told myfriend. V
I walked out there with the dog in my arms. But I
didn’t walk far. ‘ ‘
Right outside the gate, I turned to my friend and
turned the dog over to him.

“Take care of my dog for me,” I told him. Before he

couldbegin to protest, I explained the situation in 'r

terms that he could understand. “I’d consider it a great ‘
favor. I need a couple of days to break the news to my
wife, that we have another dog." .

I never so much as mentioned it to my wife. I never
had to.

Two hours later he called to tell me I’d have to find
myself another dog.

“This one’s staying with me,”,he declared.

“What about your wife?” I asked.

“Beats anything you ever saw,” he said, truly f

amazed. “I think she loves this dog even more than I

do.”

incent is a little strange, even for a cat.
‘/ My wife bought him for $10 after being stricken
with an irrational urge upon sighting the pitiful
kitty in a pet-store window.

After all, we already had two cats -— the venerable
Foggy and Nirvana, a gorgeous, long-haired Himalayan
given to us by a friend. Actually, we also had Nirvana’s
sister Indira. But Indira came down with toxoplasmosis
and died after a dispiriting $200 visit to the pet hospital’s
emergency room.

I guess that’s why my wife bought Vincent. She was
overcome with grief.

Although he was skinny and unkempt, he did have a
certain, endearing spunkiness. ‘

Now, mind you, I’m not a cat person. I grew up with a
dog. But there was something about Vincent.

He’s grown into a fine figure of a cat, but there must
have been something traumatic about his weaning. He lives
for the Opening of the bedroom Door each morning so he
can leap onto the bed and bury his face in my wife’s neck,
purring furiously.

I’ve gained a certain respect for any animal capable of
neurosis.

Which somewhat complicates my already ambiguous
attitude toward the movement to sharply reduce the use of
animals in research.

Protests have had an effect, including new federal
guidelines that will add $250 million to the cost of
scientific research involving animals, by requiring such
things as bigger cages for primates and exercise for dogs.
It’s going to cost an extra $17 million a year just to hire
peOple to walk the dogs.

Now protesters have stopped two experiments involving

 

 

cats.
Specifically, the University of Cincinnati decided to drop
experiments designed to study the effects of head trauma.
The 14-year, $1 million project had yielded valuable
insights into head trauma

But it was, to say the least, hard on the cats. The
experimenters shot the cats in the head with a .22-caliber
bullet. If that didn’t kill them, they were kept alive without
food and water for several days while scientists studied the.
changes in their brains. If they were still alive, their heads
were immersed in liquid nitrogen so that the quick-frozen
brains could be dissected.

Oh, Vincent. Thank God you can’t read.

Meanwhile, protesters blocked another cat experiment, a .
14-year study at Cornell University of the physiology of ,

barbiturate addiction.

graphic for me, eSpecially with Vin—

suck my hair.

But I have trouble with pulling the
plug on the Cornell work.

You see, a friend of mine commit—
ted suicide —— perhaps, in part, as a
result of her withdrawal from barbitu-
rates. It was years ago. Doctors were
a lot more willing to freely prescribe
uppers and downers to control mood
swings. Of course, my friend had a lot
of other problems, some going back
for years. But as I read more abcui
the Cornell research, I realized that
her shift to a doctor who insisted stat
“cold turkey” her pills may well have
been the final straw.

Now, as a. columnist, I feel a

* How about wildlife-viewing permits?

Hunting license sales in Califor-
nia have declined 44 percent since
1970, while wildlife viewing has in-
creased to where the California Di-
vision of Wildlife plans to sell
$2/ day or $10 annual passes for vis-
iting nine of the best wildlife view-
ing areas. As of January 1989, the
department plans to sell $7.50 na-
tive species stamps similar to the
hunters’ duck stamps. It is hoped
that 300,000 persons will buy passes
and stamps, bringing in $5 million.

Since the new head of the C010-
rado Division of Wildlife is con-
cerned about an adequate budget
for “managing” our wildlife, here

is a chance for non-consumptive
wildlife users to have a voice in
wildlife practices. As the Colorado
mountains are a great tourist
draw, we could count on out-of-
state and local income.

We might even persuade the de—
partment to hire a non-hunter to
head the Watchable Wildlife pro-
gram. Who knows, the division‘s
might find they could all have fat
pay raises protecting wildlife in-
stead of buying farm-raised
“game” animals to be slaughtered
by the brave “sportsmen.”

1983, CPT had set the world record for the
captive breeding of servals and caracals and the
United States record for the captive breeding of
tigers.

Also in residence at CPT are the last three
living members of a subspecies of leopard—the
Barbary desert leopard. These last three are all
females. This tragic situation, the end of this
subspecies of leopard, is a very sad example of
what is rapidly happening to many species all
over the world. If these species of animals, and
many other wild animals around the world, were
left to survive on their own in the wild, there
would be no future, no tomorrow for them, ever.

CPT is working exhaustively to keep these
species alive and healthy so that they will have a
future on this planet; so that future generations
can know what they are and enjoy them as
living, breathing species.

There is not much time left for earth’s wild
animals. One species becomes extinct every day.
The primary reason is loss of habitat. Land is
being cleared at a rate of 10,000 acres a day on
the average. The animals’ homes and ranges are
being destroyed: without a place to live, these
animals will die.

There are still many more species of cats
which CPT would like to acquire and provide
viable breeding groups for. Some of the targeted
species are the pampas cat, geoffroy’s cat, the
kodkod, the Borneo bay cat, the rusty-spotted cat,

the m'arbled cat and the flat-headed cat. These
are all from third world countries and are in
imminent danger of extinction. So far there are
no breeding groups of these animals, which
maintain genetic variability, in captivity. It is
both expensive and time consuming to acquire
and maintain these animals properly. CPT hopes
to provide a safe sanctuary for as many of these
species as possible.

 

In May of this year, after 6 months of work to
secure government cooperation and appropriate
permits, CPT director, Dr. Michael Bleyman
returned from the Philippines with 13 animals .
representing ﬁve endangered carnivore species,
four of which have never before been held in
captivity. These animals are known in the
Philippines as Musang, a collective term for small
animals. The effort to-save these animals is
called the Musang Project. Those Mike brought
back with him include the oriental civet,
binturong, oriental small-clawed otter, a species of
black civet that may be a newly discovered
species, and the ”leopard cat.

CPT has initiated a joint project with
Silliman University in the Philippines to save the
Philippine leopard cat. It is a subspecies of
leopard cat and is thought to be the smallest wild
cat. As adults they may reach only about three
pounds. In a matter of 2 or 3 years they may
become extinct if no effort is made to save them.
In their native land there is no hope for their
survival. It is difficult to explain to a poor and

 

hungry people that certain animals and lands
should be saved. As with most other species of
small wild cat, there is no captive breeding
program in existence. If CPT, in cooperation with
Silliman University, is able to acquire enough
unrelated pairs of leopard cats in time, there is
hope that through CPT’s captive breeding
program, they will survive.

In an effort to support the Musang Project
and help save the leopard, cat, the author, also a
wildlife artist, has released an original oil
painting of a Palawan Philippine leopard cat in a
limited number of prints. Each print will be
signed, dated and numbered by the artist. Those
wishing to support CPT’s work to save the
leopard cat are invited to purchase one or more of
these 11 x 17 prints. CPT is a non-profit,
charitable organization. Each print is $25.00
which includes shipping. All profits generated
from the sales of these prints will support CPT’s
Musang Project. Prints may be ordered from:

The

Carnivore
Preservation
Trust

“Photos and'Article by
Sally Smith Steenland

Hidden away in the hills of North Carolina,
near Pittsboro, in Chatham County, is a 60 acre
farm where ocelots, leopards, tigers, jaguars and
many more exotic wild cats live with two
humans. These animals are rare and endangered
species of carnivores from third world countries.
The humans are Dr. Michael Bleyman, director of
the Carnivore Preservation Trust, and Kay
Reames, the manager. They are both dedicated to
the responsible preservation of endangered cats
and to hold off the extinction of these species.

The Carnivore Preservation Trust (CPT) is the
only organization of its kind in the world. Its
goal is to improve the genetic makeup of the
animals it keeps. The work that Dr. Bleyman and
Reames are doing is considered by authorities on
this subject to be essential if these animals are to
survive. At the CPT farm, the animals are held
in a safe, protected environment. They have large,
natural enclosures and live in normal social
groupings. Reproduction is carefully monitored and
controlled with hormonal implants in order to
prevent overbreeding or inbreeding. It is necessary
to maintain at least seven breeding pairs of each
species in order to insure genetic variability and
preserve the integrity and uniqueness of each
species.

The scientists at CPT, and many other
scientists around the world, have expressed belief
that there is not a wild territory to which to
return many of the endangered animals. As' a
result, if these animals are to survive, they will
have to live in a man-made world. For this
reason, Dr. Bleyman uses an innovative and
unique hands-on technique with cats at the
compound. From the day they are born the
animals are hand raised at animal compound, or
in specially chosen human foster homes. They are
socialized with humans as well as members of
their own species. This creates a special bond
between the animals and humans which carries
over even to visitors at the grounds.

Many zoological parks display some of the
rare or endangered species, but most are not able

to get involved with saving these species,
genetically speaking. They are limited by space
and ﬁnancial obligations. They must have the
animals that draw public support and attention.
The tiger and snow leopard are good examples of
the better known animals that the public wants
to see. But there are many less well known,
smaller animals which most people do not even
know exist. Animals like the marbled cat, the
clouded leopard, and the rusty-spotted cat are as
deserving of preservation and survival as the
more popular species. CPT wants to prevent the
extinction of these animals.

The animals that live at CPT now include
breeding pairs of the binturong and the sun bear
(the only two non-feline carnivore species there),
the serval,‘ ocelot, caracal, margay, jaguar,
leopard, tiger, clouded leopard, and Siberian lynx.
CPT has never failed to reproduce any species of
animals which they maintained as adult pairs. By

Researchers
Hope Trio
Can Adjust

‘By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

Three hand-raised young grey
foxes wearing radio transmitters
will be released into the wilds of
Warren County tonight in a track-
ing project sponsored by a re-
searcher from the University of
Alaska.

The experiment is aimed at de-
termining whether grey foxes
raised by humans can adapt to life
in their natural habitat.

“Nobody has ever tracked grey
foxes for this purpose,” explained
Suzie Sutton, director of the Miss-
ouri Wildlife Rescue Center, in
Kirkwood.

The foxes were about 10 days old
when they were found in Pulaski
County and brought to the center
last spring. Sutton said the pups’
mother either had been shot or
died from other causes.

For a short time, the foxes were
nursed by a cat owned by the fam-
ily that had found them.

Sutton and Doug Dufer, her hus-
band and her helper at the center,
raised the foxes at their home, in a
wooded area near Kirkwood Park.
She said the foxes were in “prime
shape” and weighed close to 16
pounds each. '

,“That’s one of the advantages of
being hand-raised,” Sutton said.
She said the average grey fox that
is brought to the center from the
wild weighs about 9 pounds.

Sutton said people who rehabili-
tate animals long have been suspi-
cious of whether they are success-
ful in releasing hand-raised grey
foxes back into the wild. She said
the animals were especially prone
to “imprinting,” [coming to recog-
nize humans and be attracted to
humans as wild-raised grey foxes
would respond to their own kind.

"Those species that can leave the
center with a fear of man, they
have a better chance of survival,”
she said. "If these animals are go-
ing to walk up to hunters, they’ll get
blown away.

“In the case of red foxes and coy-
otes, something'in their psyches
clicks at five months, and they
don’t want to have anything to do
with you. But nothing imprints like
a grey fox.” . .

To lessen human contact when
the foxes were young, Sutton

'slipped food into their cages while 1
they slept. Because grey foxes are .

nocturnal, they were kept inside
cages in her garage during the day

radio transmitter that will be used to track it in the Wild.

and placed in fenced-in compounds
in Sutton’s back yard at night.

Sutton said Erich Follmann of
the University of Alaska’s Institute
of Arctic iology is. “one of the
foremost trackers of wild canids,”
the family of dogs, wolves, jackals
and foxes. Follmann had studied
grey and red foxes while at South-
ern Illinois University at Carbon-
dale and is sponsoring the tracking
project.

The three foxes were equipped
with radio collars that have been
modified with elastic so that the
collars will slip off if the animal
becomes entangled. The animals
will be released in a 1,000-acre
area of Warren County where hu-

man contact is minimal and hunt-'

ing is prohibited.

“They don’t have to be taught to
kill,” Sutton said. “We feed them
large lab rats that have been known
to hold off a coyote. With the greys,
the rats don’t even hit the ground.”

Sutton will camp nearby and
hopes to track the animals for up to
three weeks.

 

“They’ve been living in my world
for all this time, now I’m going to
be living in their world,” she said.
“If all else fails, and we lose them
altogether, I have a friend who 11.3.:
a plane and we’ll try to find them
that way.”

If the animals linger near her
camp, Sutton plans to use firecrack-
ers and other methods to send them
off on their own.

“I’m doing nothing different than
what Mother Fox would do,” she
said, adding that fall is the season
when animal families normally
disperse.

If the experiment proves that the
foxes cannot adjust, Sutton said ani-
mal rehabilitators can use their re-
sources to save species that can
adjust.

“We felt this was really impor-
tant to know: Are we wasting our
time and money raising animals
that cannot be released into the
wild?” Sutton said. “I would rather
destroy them than put out animals
that can only suffer intolerably and

1e.”

Oh Come On Now,
Dear Hearts, Let
Whales Be Whales

I like whales just as much as the
next person. 'I was in Maui once and
could look out my hotel room and see a
whale anytime I wanted to.

After witnessing my eighth whale, I
lost interest, however. Whales are a lot
like liberal Democrats. You’ve seen one,
etc.

So now we have the story that cap-
tured the attention of a great deal of the
woﬂd. '

Those three whales got caught in the
ice up in Alaska. One died, but even the
Russians sent over an icebreaker to get
the other two out.

It probably wouldn’t have been all
that big a story if it had been covered
only by newspapers. _

Newspapers would have put the sto-
ry back on page 17 and a few veterinari-
ans might have glanced through 1t, but
that’s about all. ‘

 

Perfect Story for Television

’ But this was a perfect story for tele-
vision, what with nothing else much go-
ing on but Bush and Dukakis trading
verbal blows. ,-

They had that great footage of the
two whales bouncing up and down out of
the water in order to breathe and the ca-
ble news network updated the story ap—
proximately every eight seconds.

Here’s what I think about the
whales: .

It was their own fault they got caught
in the ice. They lingered around the
feeding ground far too long after the oth-
er whales had left.

Once I was at a dinner in Heidel-
berg, Germany. They were giving away
free beer to our group. We were off on a
sightseeing voyage down the Rhine.

When the tour director said, “Back ..
in the bus, everybody,” I said to my din-
ner companions: “There’s plenty of time
left. Let’s have another pitcher of beer.”

We got left, and my companions
made me pay for the taxi ride back to
the ship, which took all my deutsche
marks. .

“Let’s hang around and have a few
more fish,” one of the whales said to the
others, and they got bus-left like I did.

 

Millions Spent for Whales

I have no idea how much money was
spent on the whales, but it must have
run into the millions.

How many homeless Americans
could have benefited by all that money?
And why don’t the Russians free the
people they trap inside their own coun-

try before they get so concerned about

trapped whales?

We worry about the lives of the two

whales, but how many fish do we kill by
allowing factories to dump waste into
our rivers?

We worry about the lives of two
whales, but we aren’t doing very much

about acid rain, which kills forests and

the animal life that inhabits them.

We worry about the lives of two
whales, but turn 15 zillion hunters loose
in the woods to kill Bambi-

Little Jessica McClure trapped in
that well in Texas was a news story. Two
whales trapped in the ice in Alaska was
nature doing what comes naturally.

PETA contends that the law only regulates housing
and sanitation in laboratories, not experimental proce-
dures. It further charges that agency inspections occur
only once a year.

“PETA is to animals what César Chavez is to mi-
grants,” Pacheco says of his life’s work. And, like Chavez,
Pacheco vows to never give up the struggle.“The move-
ment is still in its infancy,” he declares.

DENVER P09? — October 16, 1988

What started Pacheco—born in Joliet, Illinois, to a
Mexican father and Peruvian mother—on this miSSion?

“The turning point for me came in 1978,” Pacheco
recalls. Twenty years old at the time, he was traveling
through Canada, and stopped to visit a friend working
‘in a large Toronto slaughterhouse.

“What I saw changed my life.” he says. “Anyone’yvho
sees what I did would give up meat right away. He
immediately sought out: and joined the animal protec—
tion community. . . :

Pacheco’s ﬁrst ventures into the animal rights move-

1‘ merit were educational. He sailed to Alaska to study
humpback whales, and joined research expeditions in
the Atlantic and Great Britain. . '

When he decided he needed ﬁrst-hand experience in
a laboratory, he volunteered his services at the Silver
Springs Institute for Behavioral Research in Maryland.

There, he worked in a primate lab where experiments
were conducted on surgically crippled monkeys to
monitor the rehabilitation of their limbs.

Sickened by what he saw, and determined to do
something about what he describes as needless suffer-
ing, ﬁlthy cages, inadequate food and untreated inju-
ries, Pacheco began to prepare a criminal case. He kept
a log of his observations, photographed the animals and
lab conditions, led experts in a clandestine tour of the
lab and secured afﬁdavits from them.

Pacheco took the evidence to the Silver Springs police,
who issued a search-and-seizure warrant. The 17
monkeys and ﬁles were conﬁscated, and the lab
operator was arrested.

enFounded in Washington in 1980, PETA is an educa-

tional and activist group opposed to all forms of ammal
ion. .
“Biggie seemed to be a need in the nation’s capital for
an organization that would take on animal rights issues
in a hard-hitting way,” Pacheco says. Issues suchﬁas
abuses in laboratory research and slaughterhouses.

In tackling those issues, Pacheco has worked under-
cover to document abuses in a Maryland primate lab,
has staged sit-ins and lined up beneﬁt concerts. He has
spearheaded lobbying efforts, organized letter-writingr
campaigns, testiﬁed in court and at Congressrona

hearings.

 

Predictably, the research community disagrees With
' 'loso h . .
11135:; MESlZBy, vice president of research. at” the
University of Oregon, calls PETA “irresponSIble for
advocating a ban on animal research. Mosleys lab was
recently taken to task in two PETA newsletters for its
“experiments on kittens, rats and other animals. _
“I agree that animal experiments should be carried

out in an ethical manner, and must be designed to
beneﬁt human or animal health,” Mosley says. “But
PETA’s position that animals should not be used at all
is not practical. Some research on vaccines and surgical
procedures cannot be done with computer models.”

Pacheco was an environmental studies major at
George Washington University when he and Ingrid
Newkirk, a DC. health ofﬁcial, started PETA with a
budget of $60 and the help of a few volunteers.

Today, PETA has 36 employees and 250,000 mem—
bers. Funded by membership contributions, it has an
annual budget of $5 million.

 

. In the years since, Pacheco has established an
impressive record in animal rights. In 1983, PETA
investigators drew public attention to the Department
of Defense’s Wound Laboratory, near Washington,
where researchers planned to ﬁre bullets into stray
dogs, cats and other animals.

The publicity generated by PETA led to a permanent
national ban on the shooting of dogs and cats inside
such military facilities.

In 1984, PETA helped close down a Falls County,

' Texas, slaughterhouse where horses were kept in

inhumane conditions until they were killed for human
consumption in Europe. The next year, a PETA
campaign against mistreatment of animals at the City
of Hope research facility in California resulted in the
National Institutes of Health suspending $5 million in
ﬁinds, and in the Department of Agriculture levying a
$11,000 ﬁne on the City of Hope. '
PETA’S latest campaign is to bring public pressure
on major cosmetic and household product manufactur- -
ers to stop what it terms “cruel and unnecessary” testing

, of products on animals.

“There are no gray areas with PETA and its goal to
eliminate all animal research,” counters Frankie Trull.
She is president of the Foundation for Biomedical
Research, a nonproﬁt, educational organization that
assists the research community in raising public aware-
ness of humane animal research.

Animal studies, researchers maintain, lead to a better
understanding and treatment. of diseases affecting

phuman beings and animals. According to Trull, lab

animal use is properly regulated by numerous laws and

_ agencies.

PETS I Exotic animals’ weird

 

Can a I I

racy Lingbeck’s sulfur-crested

cockatoo, Houdini, and her 1-year-

old twin boys are competing in a
high-pitched screaming contest that
threatens to shatter the crystal in their
San Jose home. But after ﬁve years of
keeping exotic birds, Lingbeck shrugs it
off. “I’m used to it,” she says. Anyway,
it’s nothing compared with the din that
erupted last November, when the macaw
bit a hole in the Amazon parrot’s leg
and ran up $800 in veterinary bills.

Lingbeck is one of 30,000 to 50,000
people in this country who own, breed or
show exotic animals, according to the
Animal Finders’ Guide, a Prairie Creek,
Ind., newsletter for animal brokers.
Bored with dogs, cats and other house-
hold fauna, these fanciers prefer parrots,
monkeys, lions, bobcats and skunks.

But putting up a rare parrot in the
living room or a lion in the garage may
be more trendy than smart. “Their space
requirements usually are huge. Social
patterns and diets are complex. And you
may not even be able to tell when they’re
sick,” says Susan Lieberman, a wildlife
expert with the Humane Society of the
United States. Besides, she says, the sale
of exotics decimates animal populations;
up to 80 percent of parrots destined for
shipment to the US. from South Ameri-
ca, Asia, Africa and other areas die
when captured or in transit.

Your local vet, moreover, is unlikely to
know much about exotic animals, many
of which wind up at zoos after their
owners tire of them. “We get them every
day,” says Patrick Morris, a consulting
veterinarian at the Knoxville Zoological
Park. Pat Hoctor, publisher of theAnimal
Finders’ Guide, is more upbeat. “It can
work,” he says, “if you’re responsible.”

Expert advice. Prices for exotic animals
aren’t in the mutt-at-the—pound league,
either. At Casa de Pets, an exotic-animal
shop in Sherman Oaks, .Calif., lion cubs
cost $500, tigers $3,500 and white leop-
ards $25,000. Birds range from $195 for
an umbrella cockatoo to $22,000 for a
black palm cockatoo.

Various organizations will help you
select a pet, conventional or otherwise.
The Pet Industry Joint Advisory Coun-
cil in Washington, DC, at (800) 553-
PETS, keeps a list of some 7800 pet
groups such as the International Llama
Association in Denver. The American
Veterinary Medical Association, (800)
248-2862, can refer you to experts at

IVER DAMAGE,” the Doc said.
“Your buddy has six weeks.”
I was shocked. Chico was dying.
My best friend. Our bond trans—
cended words. Faithful friend, loyal
companion. Now this. I wanted to do
something, I wanted to give him an hon—
orable funeral, a burial to. set the stan-
dard for all Chihuahuas.

To get a leap on arrangements, I went
to Paw Print Gardens Pet Cemetery in
West Chicago and engaged in some “pre—
need purchasing,” as the brochure calls
it. Reading it over in the chapel/ office, I
knew I was doing the right thing. “De—
cisions made while experiencing the
trauma of a pet loss are sometimes costly
and often regrettable. Financially it is a
wise investment; you receive todays [sic]
prices for a service you may conceivably
need years from now.”

Well, it’s easy to miss Paw Print. Most
people don’t even know it’s there. May-
be that’s because it’s in Patricia Blosser’s
back yard. Just off North Avenue,
which is constantly rumbling with
dump trucks on the samba line through
DuPage County, the cemetery opened
in 1970. The area was quiet then, but just
as DuPage has boomed, so has the
cemetery. Since burying her first animal,
a Doberman, Blosser has dispatched
about seventeen hundred dogs, six hun-
dred cats, a housebroken duck, two
monkeys, twenty-four horses, and two
people.

Business at Paw Print transpires in the
new Patricia Blosser Memorial Chapel,
which replaced the original chapel, an
old corn crib she dragged off a farmer’s
field twenty years earlier. A bronze
plaque outside reads: “If Christ would
have had a dog it would have followed
him to the Cross.” I thought of Chico.
Then I sat in the oak—paneled and shag-
carpeted counseling room and told
Blosser my needs. After listening, she

That buys you the “Simple Burial,” the
equivalent of a mob flunky’s grave: no

wanted that I would’ve let Chico hang
out with the Spilotro brothers.

So I moved up to the $95 sites. For
this, plus a $35 opening and closing fee
(digging the hole, then putting the dirt
back in), you can bury your once bright
and beautiful friend in the Gardens of
Love, Tranquility or Gentle Giants,

the opinion that it was ‘only an animal.’
They can only add to your discomfort.”

All this got me to thinking of staying
close to Chico. Forever. You can be
buried at Paw Print, too; the only stip-

ulations being that you must be cre—
mated and that you either have a pet
interred on the premises, or have made
arrangements for one. The price for peo—

For 25 years Gus Evers served as the
guardian of Papago Park. From 1934 he
waged a battle to protect its natural
beauty. '

Evers left the park in 1959, but the
stone house he lived instill stands on a
hill in the heart of the Phoenix Zoo.

His granddaughter, who lived in the
house with him until she was 5, gazes
fondly at the structure every day when
she goes to work in the zoo office. She
says visitors often comment on it.

But Sue Donovan fears for the future

of the family heirloom and piece of
Valley history. No plans for it were
outlined in the 200’s ambitious new
master plan, and zoo officials say they
are "neutral” when it comes to its
future. .

"I think the house’s history is
important to the Valley,” Donovan said.
“It was part of the Valley’s beginnings.”

Her daughter, 18-year-old Tami
Brooks, who also works at the zoo, has
launched a campaign to save the house.

“I work in the concession stand right
next to the house and a lot of customers
ask me about it. When I tell them what

it is, they get all excited. Most of the zoo

visitors want to see it saved and so do
the employees. '

"But zoo officials told me it would,
take too much money and time to
rebuild it as an exhibit and we’ve heard
rumors they want to tear it down.”

Jeff Blaugrund, marketing director
for the zoo, said the 200’s position “is no
position.” 4 . g

The Phoenix Historic Preservation Com-
missmn said Evers’ home is on a recently
completed list of city-owned historic proper-
ties and will be considered for historic
overlay zoning to protect it.

"We plan to make a decision on initiating
overlay zoning on those properties on

says.

"Fifty percent of the zoo is still iii—3353’-
oped, and there are many existing exhibits
that need remodeling ﬁrst,” he said.

The small house sits on a hill adjacent to
the park entrance. It is bordered by the
front lake, the children’s zoo, the elephant
exhibit and the train station.

It was built in the late 19205 by the War
Prisoners Association. Evers moved into it
in the 19305, when he was guardian of the
park and supervisor of the Hunt Bass
Hatchery, which raised game ﬁsh for lakes
throughout Arizona and New Mexico.

Donovan, who has worked in the zoo
ofﬁce for more than a year, says she and her
parents lived in the house with her paternal
grandfather from 1945 to 1950.

Special to The Denver Post

LAS CRUCES, N.M. — Dean An—
derson’s rented livestock have
been munching away on four-wing
saltbush, a tasty rangeland dish if
ever there was one.

But they won’t be doing it for
long. Soon, Anderson’s eight ani-
mals will have eaten all the salt-
bush on their fenced-in land in
southern New Mexico. After that,
they’ll have nothing left to graze
but wiry mesquite bushes.

Anderson and his fellow scien-
tists may then find out if the drom-
edaries have a role in reclaiming
the barren Southwest.

Dromedaries. As in camels.

‘Not a joke’

“We knew there’d be people
who’d look on this as a joke,” said
Anderson, a U.S. Agriculture De-
partment animal research scien-
tist. “It’s different — but no way is
it a joke.”

Earlier this year, Anderson and
his colleagues leased the eight
camels to see if they will eat large
quantities of undesirable shrubs —
such as mesquite and creosote -
on government-owned rangeland.

Cattle refuse to eat those shrubs,
' allowing the plants to spread and
kill out desirable grasses and
, shrubs. The hope is that, although
; camels prefer saltbush, they even-

tually will eat the other plants and
thus clear the land so government
workers can reseed it.

Early ranchers thought nothing
of the future and rushed to take ad-
vantage of the wide-open range. As
the grasses disappeared, wind and
water erosion removed the topsoil,

'making it even more difficult for

the grasses to return.

The result is a vast southern
New Mexico landscape that Ander-
son termed “some of the most de-

graded ‘rangeland in the South-

west.”
For decades, ranchers and re-
searchers have been struggling to

f’Vi/dcat Canyon

 

October 19, 1988

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

By Pearl Stewart
and Sharon McCormick
Chronicle East Bay Bureau , ,,

Cat~catchers will return to

the Wildcat Canyon area of

‘ Oakland’s Tilden Park this

month to resume the practice of

trapping an ever-increasing

population of domestic felines
that have turned wild.

The East Bay Regional Park
District’s Board of Directors yester-
day reinstated the trapping pro-

gram on 3 540-1 vote after it was’

suspended last month because of
complaints from animal-loving park
visitors. ; .

“We must provide safe parks,”
said park district board member
Harlan Kassel, who cited a recent
case of a 3~year-old girl being sur~
rounded by the roaming cats as she
ate a piece of chicken at a family
picnic in the park.

“The cats were going to get that
chicken one way or another,” said
Kassel, adding that the girl’s mother
had to rescue her daughter from
the threatening animals.

The problem has been com-
pounded by regular “feeders” who
bring cat food to the area, a practice
that park officials say has contribut-
ed to an increase in the cat popula-
tion. Kent said feeding feral ani~
mals is against park regulations.

Park officials contend that the
cats create health hazards for the
public and are disrupting the bal-
ance of nature in the park.

Opponents of the trapping con-
tend that park officials should make
more of an attempt to crack down
on pet owners who dump their ani-
mals in the park. They also contend
that the cats in the park’s study
group, which have have been neu-
tered. should be allowed to remain
there. '

Marie Smith, who belongs to a
loosely organized group of cat lov-
a ers fighting the trapping, said park
1 f officials should be “more flexible"
in finding solutions to the cat prob-
lems. ‘

“I‘m interested in a spirit of
compromise in resolving this situa-

tion,” Smith said yesterday at a pub-
lic hearing in Oakland.

Smith said that if the trapping
must be done, her group favors
“separating out the cats that have
recently been abandoned” and
making the tamer cats available for
adoption. -

Park general manager Jerry
Kent said that even though the trap-
ping will resume, park employees
will post additional signs warning
people not to leave or feed animals
in the park.

Although some park officials
were willing to work with the advo-
cate groups to find a way to put the
cats up for adoption, some board
members disagreed.

“We’re not in the cat adoption
business, as much as I like the idea,”
said park board member Kay Peter-
sen. ‘

“If someone wants to take them
home and try to adopt them, fine,”
she said.

_ “But I don’t think we should
take responsibility for them.”

Howls for the wolf

 

Regarding your splendid article
about the wolf (“Bringing Back the
Beast of Lore,” June—July): Having
had some experience with this mag-
niﬁcent (and intelligent) animal I
can tell you I’d trust the wolf before
I’d trust some politicians. To those
who would bring about the extinc-
tion of this remarkable creature, I’d

- - like to suggest they devote the same

energy toward learning about it.
You’d be surprised how quickly the
myths are dispelled.

I shudder to think of the wholesale
slaughter and suffering of elk,
moose, buffalo, and other prey ani-
mals if wolves are introduced into
Yellowstone. Millions of peeple have
enjoyed the sight of plentiful wildlife
in the park, but I think this will be a
thing of the past if wolves are al-
lowed to roam uncontrolled. Control
of surplus game animals can be han-
dled much more humanely by hunt-
ers rather than torn apart and eaten
alive, as is the custom of wolves.

‘Porkers of the World, Unite!

IF YOU’RE STROLLING down the midway at the Fryeburg Fair, in Fryeburg,
Maine, this month, you may want to take advantage of what could be your
last chance ever to see a greased pig. Or, if you’re like the four hundred
members of the Maine Animal Coalition, you may not. The MAC would like
to abolish pig scrambles -. popular events in which rural children are loosed
upon a (traditionally) grease—slathered porker in an attempt to capture it —
but for now they’re happy to have gotten the state to abolish grease, which
tends to prolong the ordeal. Even .without lubrication, complains MAC
spokesman Will Anderson, scrambles are “an inappropriate way to interact
with an animal on a recreational basis.”
' Anderson, who owns an ecologically themed gift shop in Portland, is a
radical vegetarian, and is so finicky about his interaction with animals that he ‘
- refuses to wear leather shoes. He and other members of his group feel that pig
, scrambles exploit the pigs, and further, that they might get squashed. “It’s not
uncommon for ISO-pound children to participate in these events,” one MAC
member said, “ﬂinging themselves on top of terriﬁed little piglets.”
Whether pigs share the MAC’s concern is a matter of some speculation;
Anderson admits that he and his followers aren’t really sure what goes through
a pig’s mind when it’s being chased down by a dozen galumphing farm boys.
Says Anderson of the group’s antiscrambling arguments: “A lot of it is [based
on] subjective opinion of what the pig is experiencing.”
All this hoopla is a bit puzzling to Phillip Andrews, a director of the fair for
forty years. “We’ve had seven or eight hundred pigs go through our scrambles,”
he says, “and I’ve never seen a pig hurt.”

Saving these whales saves ourselves

By Christie Golden
USA TODAY columnist

WASHINGTON — Once upon a time, there were
three little whales — Bone, Crossbeak and Bonnet . . .

Some people think the story of the two remaining
whales trapped off Point Barrow, Alaska, has as much
relevance to today’s world as a fairy tale.

But who are the people working to free these
trapped sea mammals?

Marine biologists. National Guardsmen. Oil compa-
ny employees. Eskimos, or Inupiats, who are using
tools designed for killing bowhead whales — an impor-
tant source of food for the native Alaskans — to break
breathing holes in the foot-deep ice.

Even the Soviet Union is lending a hand.

Why are all these pe0ple, whose personal interests
are seemingly in conﬂict, so dedicated to saving the
lives of two marine animals? “It makes us feel good
inside to save those whales,” said Lawrence Ahmao—
gak, one of the would—be rescuers.

Whales have always attracted us; tales of leviathan
and behemoth Sprinkle our myths. Capable of easily
overturning boats crammed with whale-watching tour-
ists, the benevolent beasts prefer to surface nearby and

 

the Point Barrow whales

Saving whales loses a good meal

By Jesse Hill Ford

jestingly spray us little land-
dwellers with mist.

Though members of an endan-
gered species, in the vast scheme
of things, these two California
gray whales wouldn’t be that
much missed.

What matters more than the in-
dividual lives of these gentle, in-
telligent sea giants is how we
have reacted to their plight.

For a moment, we paused. We
took our noses out of grisly re-
ports of the cruelties that man
can inﬂict and turned our gazes, however brieﬂy, to the
north. We were moved to a selﬂess, motiveless com-
passion for creatures very different from ourselves.
Our president sent his prayers for these lost whales; he
wasn’t alone.

Thanks to the dedicated rescuers, there is hope for
Crossbeak and Bonnet. And maybe there’s h0pe for us,
too — perhaps because of these whales, we’re a little
more human.

It’s not over yet,'but we can hope for — and work for
- a happy ending. And that’s no fairy tale.

ATLANTA JOURNAL - November 1, 1988

Animal Shelter Besct
With Debts Spared

Foreclosure, For Now

By Anne Cowles
Sfaﬂl‘i‘ritcr

Life For God’s Stray Animals,

a controversial no-kill shelter in
Rockdale County, has been spared
the sale of its properties at public
auction —- at least until next
month.

Notices of foreclosure pro-
ceedings, originally scheduled for
Tuesday, were pulled from Rock-
dale and Walton County newspa-
pers last week after a woman in
Florida offered to pay off 3
$19,695.78 mortgage on the proper-
ties for an unpaid pet food bill.

But an attorney for two men
who hold that mortgage said Mon-
day that the woman, whom he de-
clined to identify, has not come
through with the funds.

“If we don’t have it in hand by
Tuesday, then we‘ll simply refile
the foreclosure advertisements. . . .
Then, foreclosure would take
place on December 6," said Mi-
, chael Terrell, an attorney repre-
senting Alton Housworth Jr. and
Clarence Hall in the foreclosure
proceedings.

Faced with unpaid bills for pet
food. gas, fencing and legal fees,
Ann and Jerry Fields in May 1986
transferred title of their proper-
ties to creditors in an effort to buy
time to pay off the debts.

The $19,695.78 mortgage is One
of six on the properties of Life For
God’s Stray Animals, which has
sheltered more than 1,000 animals
at a time at two sites. All but the
first mortgage is in default.

Abe Sharony, attorney for the
Fieldses, said, “I think the woman
is just a red herring. I‘m very
skeptical the money will come
throughf’

Mr. Housworth and Mr. Hall,
who hold a $135,000 first mortgage
on the Fieldses‘ purchase of land
on Miller Bottom Road in Walton
and Rockdale counties, also have
purchased the third mortgage of
$22,992.11 from a law partnership
where Mr. Sharony previously

worked, and the fOurth mortgage
of $11,074.83 from Gas Inc.

Additionally, Rockdale County
holds a $165,500 judgment against
the Fieldses stemming from a 1986
ruling by the Georgia Supreme
Court. In that case, the high court
upheld contempt charges and dai—
ly fines against the Fieldses for
not moving all of the animals from
their original site in Rockdale
County after a judge declared it a
public nuisance.

The Fieldses have been fugi-
tives on the civil contempt charges
since July 1986. .

Mr. Terrell said Mr. Hous-
worth, a real estate broker, and
Mr. Hall, a builder and developer,
now are considering foreclosure
on three of the four mortgages
they hold.

“If we foreclose on three of
these at one time, I don’t think
anyone is going to come out of the
background on behalf of the she]-
ter and pay all that money cash
and have nothing to show for it,”
Mr. Terrell said. .

The threat of foreclosure is the
latest development in legal and fi-
nancial problems that in recent
years have plagued Life For God’s
Stray Animals, which provides
permanent care for sick and un-
wanted animals.

' In 1984, the original Farmer
Road shelter was deemed a nui-
sance and ordered closed by Rock-
dale County Superior Court Judge
Clarence Vaughn. who issued the
same ruling in 1987 against the
new Miller Bottom Road shelter.
The US. Supreme Court declined
to hear appeals of both lower
court rulings.

As a result. the Fieldses face
additional contempt charges for
failing to abide by the 1987 court
order to close the Miller Bottom
Road shelter. A contempt hearing
is scheduled this month in Rock-
dale Superior Court, according to
John Walton Henderson, attorney
for Miller Bottom Road residents
opposed to that shelter.

 

 

 




RescarclﬁrS try

to save cranes

get the newly hatched chicks to
adjust to new wilderness settings.

That is where Seney comes in.

Leaders of the Michigan United
Conservation Club pushed for
$20,000 in federal funds to continue
the Seney project.

At Seney, Richard Urbanek, a
researcher from Ohio State Universi-
ty, and his assistant Eileen Stoetzer,
slipped under gray-tinted sheets and
used a puppet resembling the head of
a crane on an extended arm to feed
the young birds. They played record-
ings of senior sandhill cranes brood-
ing and making mating calls.

“It is a new technique to put an
imprint on them just as if they were

 

being raised by adult sandhill
cranes,” said Jim Kurth, acting ref-
uge manager at Seney.

EACH DAY the young birds
would be taken on long walks, follow-
ing behind or, at times, ﬂying ahead
of, the cloaked adults. They learned
to hunt butterﬂies, grasshoppers and
other insects while gradually perfect-
ing flying skills.

The key was to be accepted by
other adult sandhill cranes who will
help them migrate to Florida. Outﬁt-
ted by radio collars so Urbanek can
track them, eight of the young birds
already have departed -—— along .a
route that takes them through
Wisconsin, 3 game refuge in Indiana
and eventually to winter in Florida.
Hopefully, the other eight chicks will
leave soon.

Russell McKee, who also has put
on the sheets and puppet to observe
the program, estimates it will take
another year before the experiment
can be extended to whooping cranes.

“There is hope that will start in

Mackinac Co.

 

 

 

 

._ . - The Detroit News‘
1990,” said McKee, who reports that

previous efforts to use sandhill’

cranes as surrogate parents —— to
hatch whooper eggs and raise the
birds with their own brood —— has
had poor results.

A Deer Killer
Near Petoluma

By George Snyder
Chronicle North Bay Bureau.

State Department of Fish
and Game officials said yester-
day that the killer of a rare
white fallow deer in the I’ctaltr
ma area over the weekend may
face prosecution.

The large buck. a member of an
exotic species, had been seen re-
peatedly in a rural. residential area
near Penngroye between Petaluma’
and Rohnert Park in the past sever-
al days. Other white deer, presum-
ably fallow deer. have been seen
from time to time during the past
year in the hills east of Hohnert
Park.

The killing outraged neighbors
and other county residents.

“I‘ve. been getting calls all day," ,
said Brian Hunter, regional director i
of Fish and Game in Yountville. .
"One lady vsas very irate -- she was
even mad at me. We intend to con- ;‘
duct an investigation and do what ;

we can in this case."

 

Hunter said the deer slayer
would be charged with shooting a

' deer out of season. a misdemeanor
, carrying a maximum $500 fine and
six months in county jail.

Although officials have not of-
ficially identified a suspect. I'lSh
and Game warden Vlayne Howe

confiscated 3 Winchester 270 rifle .

immediately after the shooting
from the owner of property where
the animal was shot.

Fallow deer are native to areas
in Southern Europe. Malaysia and
Asia Minor. Fish and Game officials
believe. the white deer most likely

initially escaped from an enclosure i
on nearby \k'arrington Road where 3
a landowner holds a permit to keep

the exotic animals.

Hunter said the
"shows that we now have a whole
new kind of deer herd in Sonoma
County."

Fallow deer herds already
roam near Point {eyes and south-
west of \‘l‘illits. it is legal to shoot
them during authorized hunting
seasons.

he whooping crane, still on the brink

of extinction, may make a comeback

by using a bird refuge in Michigan’s
Upper Peninsula as a nesting site — while
accepting a little subterfuge.

In a test program just ending, researchers
dressed in costumes resembling adult cranes
to raise newly hatched sandhill crane chicks, a
relative of the whooping crane.

The idea: Don’t let the cranes think

humans are their friends. The researchers
went. so far as to don equipment made to make
their hands look like crane bills to feed the
chicks. ‘ _

.The Seney National Wildlife Refuge, an
95,000—acre wetland preserve, is one of three
sites being considered for an experimental
program to establish a flock of the tall, stately
white whooping cranes.

Researchers at Seney successfully raised
16 sandhill cranes last summer. The Sandhill
cranes have nesting and habitat needs similar

Sentence too light .’
for dog-torturing teen

Dear Ann Landers: I just read
something in the paper that made
me so angry I am spitting nail -:
What is happening in our work?
Where is justice? I will give you 4‘
few highlights and hope you can
provide some answers.

A 17-year-old boy in Flat River,
Mo., pleaded guilty to poking out
the eyes of a gray terrier with a
coat hanger and breaking the dog's
hind legs. The animal had to be de-
stroyed.

The act was called a “misde-
meanor” and the teenager was sen-
tenced to a year in jail. He could
have been fined up to $1,000 but he
wasn’t.

The prosecutor said he had con-
ferred with representatives of the
Missouri Humane Society and that
they were satisfied with the sen-
tenee.

Not only am I burned up about
this kid getting off so easily, but I
am deeply concerned about what he
might do when he gets out. Please
give me your views - Overland
Park, Kan. ‘ '

Dear Kan: I checked to make
sure your facts were correct. They
were right on the mark, according
to The Associated Press.

A teen-ager who could perform
such a cruel and inhuman act must
be seriously disturbed.

Scaredy-cat goats (lroép

like ﬂies when startled

United Press international

SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. -- Besides
becoming, quick and easy meals for
coyotes, the bizarre “fainting goats” of

‘ Tennessee are catching on as pets from

coast to coast, and a farmer is raising the
animals to cash in on the craze.

“People like to have them as oddities,”
said Larry Perryman of Shelbyville, who
ships the goats to other states.

The goats have a certain appeal: When
they are startled, they stiffen and collapse,
a condition known as myotonia. The trait
has earned the goats a variety of names,
including fainting goats, nervous goats,
scared goats and stiff goats.

The condition also makes them easier
prey for predators, said Betty Sain, a Bell
Buckle farmer who sold her goats after she
lost most of her herd to coyotes.

“The coyote comes onto the farm, the

nervous goats fall over and the coyote just
, trots on over and has supper,” Sain said.

Perryman demonstrated the character-

hitting a nearby shack with a stick. The
goats stiffened and fell over, remaining
down for 30 sec-ands to one minute before
getting up and munching grass as {slough
nothing had happened. .

The goats lnok normal enough... but
their habit of fainting at the sightest

Professor James Atkinson has. an :tten a
paper about the special craters.

In his paper. The Myotom'c (Fiat: A
Historical Perspective and Descrip: am of
Hereditary M yetom'a in an Animal .‘Jodel.
Atkinson said the goats can be traced back
to a small herd in Marshall County in the
1880s.

He points to a century-old letter from
Dr. H.H. Mayberry of Marshall County,
who wrote that a stranger sold him four
goats, including one billy, for $36.
Mayberry said the goats were subject to
“strange fits or fainting spells, the likes of
which had never been seen before in these
parts.”

La 'Veta elk ranch -

' By The Associated Press

LA VETA — The bugling of a
bull elk startled Bud and Betty
Kreutzer when they awakened
last New Year’s Day.

But now, the haunting call has
become a daily occurrence at
their ranch north of La Veta ~-— a
sound as common as a rooster’s
crow on a more traditional f arm.

About a year ago, the Kreutz-
ers decided elk ranching might be
a profitable venture after reading
about a similar operation near
Craig. So they obtained a game
park license from the Division of
Wildlife — one of only six in the
state —— and bought 10 elk from a
reserve in Texas.

Hunters sought

Bud Kreutzer and other family
members erected almost two
miles of 8-foot wire fence around
a 50-acre tract this summer.
Now, the only thing missing is a
supply of hunters.

“Our goal is to have hunters
come in each year,” Bud Kreutz-
er said. He said bull elk are legal
to hunt when their antlers feature
four or-more points.

The Kreutzers now have 11

cows and five calves that run ~

with their “prize bull.” Six legal
bulls are separated from the herd
—— an arrangement that mimics
" the elk’s habits in the wild.
“We’re regulated by acreage
and habitat on how many we can

sounds call to hunt

raise,” Bud Kreutzer said. “We

hope to raise more elk if-it turns

out it’s prosperous.”

There is room to grow on the
10,000-acre ranch where the
Kreutzers have lived for the past
decade. The ranch is owned by
Mrs. Kreutzer’s father, Harry
Willis. The family also owns 1,100
acres in the'mountains where
game can be hunted. Bud Kreutz-
er said there are even a couple of
good fishing holes on the ranch.

The habitat is natural, Betty
Kreutzer pointed out.

“Most people think of the elk as
living in the mountains, but they
really are a Plains animal,” she
said. Before Europeans settled in
North America, elk were among
the most numerous animals, with
herds numbering in the millions.
Wild herds. now number a few
thousand and survive only in the
most rugged areas.

Under the agreement with the
Division of Wildlife, the Kreutz-
ers can offer the bulls to hunters
regardless of the season. The
Kreutzers must buy their animals
from other breeders or in some
instances raise animals taken
from the wild.

Wild creatures

Despite living their entire lives
in captivity, the elk are far from
domestic. Unless an offering of
hay is given, the elk shy away
from human contact. The herd

bull is extremely possessive of his
cows and calves. And when the
bulls begin locking horns, it’s best
not to be in the same pasture.

One bull, hurt in a fracas with

. his companions, is being kept in a

small pen to recuperate. Startled
by visitors recently, he bolted,
rattled his horns along the fence
and finally smashed a sturdy

fence rail in a show of aggression. _

“He could probably jump the

fence if he wanted to,” Bud
Kreutzer said. “But I’m glad he
doesn’t.”

Only one elk on the ranch can .

be considered “tame.”

“I’ve hunted all my life,” Bud '

Kreutzer, 52, said. His trophies
line his living room ranging from
a bear and several deer shot on
the ranch to a moose and a ram
taken in Alaska. .

 

 




ATLANTA JOURNAL - November 3, 1988

Money to Save the Whales Was Beautifully Spent

WASHINGTON - Now that the whales have
gone, and we can look back on what happened,
the whole story seems preposterous. Absurd. Al-
most embarrassing. In one view, at least, the tale
of the gray whales of Point Barrow speaks vol-
umes about misplaced priorities and the goofi-
ness of man.

But there is another, and I think a better,
view of the rescue effort that occupied so much
attention during the three weeks the story stayed
alive. For these few October days people every-
where were moved by a deep sense of something
beyond compassion.

I cannot put a name to it. Psychologists and
dream doctors would relate the feeling to the
fear of being trapped -- a fear that constantly re-
curs in the worst of our nightmares. In some cu-
rious way, we identified with the whales, caught
under 18 inches of ice, struggling to swim free.

The story began around Oct. 7 or 8 when Roy
Ahmaogak, an Alaskan Whaler, was returning to
his home from a nearby village. In an open patch
of water, he saw three whales spouting and jos-
tling. They had overstayed their time in the Arc-
tic. In the subzero temperatures, their escape
routes were swiftly freezing.

The story could have ended before it began.
Ahmaogak might well have summoned a few
friends with gaffes and ropes, shot the whales
and butchered them for the coming winter. No
one would have said a word. The grays, once
nearly extinct, have recovered to a population
estimated'at 20,000. The three would not have
been missed.

Perhaps it was a sense of sportsmanship, a
nanifestation of the loony ambivalence observed
)y hunters everywhere. One shoots only at birds
)1} the wing. In the Blue Ridge Mountain county
where I live, one may kill a deer on a Saturday

)I‘ a Monday, but no man of honor kills on Sun-

 

In some curious way, we identified
with the whates, caught under 18 inch-
es of ice, struggling to swim free.

day. The meat is the same, but the pride is
different.

Or possibly, it was said by way of explana
tion, Eskimo palates prefer the bowhead whale
to the gray whale. Blabber from a feed lot is tast-
ier than blubber off the range. Something like
that. In any event, Ahmaogak spared the crea-
tures. He notified wildlife officials. Local radio
and television stations got onto the story. The
wire services picked it up.

By mid-October the story had taken on the
kind of irresistible momentum that defies objec-
tive analysis. Around the world, in Tokyo, Mos-
cow, Mexico City, New York, people everywhere
began to worry about the whales. Here in Wash-
ington, the story ranked with the World Series
and the presidential race. TV viewers watched
in anxious fascination as the whales surfaced,

gasped for air and sank again in the black water. ‘

A cast of characters appeared. We came to

know the Inupiat Eskimos, their smiling faces as

round and brown as new potatoes. The whales
acquired names, and the odd thing is that the
whales were not lovable or cuddly; they had
none of the charm of dolphins. We saw nothing
of them but their bloody and barnacled snouts,
rising and falling. These were not old whales,
but they had the mottled look of great age, and
they were very tired. On Oct. 21 the smallest of
the three gave up the fight.

Reporters spedto the scene, and because

.-._k~_ , .

this is America, local snowmobile taxis began
charging up to $200 a head to take the press to
ringside. The Top of the World Hotel in Barrow
ﬁlled all its 40 rooms to overflowing. Oil compae
nies saw gushers of good public relations as they
donated men and equipment. An enterprising
manufacturer in Maryland sent an awesome ma-
chine, propelled by an Archimedean screw, to
roar and snarl at the resistant ice.

Every morning and evening on the TV news
we saw the story deve10p. There were the Eski-

mos with chain saws, cheerfully sawing ice holes

like scatter rugs across the frozen waste. Great
helicopters came ﬂuttering to the site, scattering
a small band of watchful polar bears, slamming
at the ice with a five-ton wrecking ball. The de-
signers of T-shirts magically produced apprOpri-
ate souvenirs. .

Finally, as in a well—plotted play, came the
Soviet icebreakers to heighten the drama. Could
they smash through a 35-foot wall of ice? Would
they be in time? The surviving whaleswere
growing weak. Daylight was waninngnd on the
night. of the 28th, the whales disappeared. They
had found freedom. In a Point Barrow bar, Sovi~
ets and Americans toasted the rescue in sour

. mast: bourbon and excellent vodka.

The whole affair reportedly cost a million
dollars in public and private funds, but most of
the,expenses would have been incurred anyhow.
The million doubtless could have been spent
more efficiently for saving more whales. But so 7
what? The money was beautifully spent. to a
century that has seen much of humankind a. its
worst, for a few ticks of the clockwe witness-aw:
something better, a time in which God’s new
tures knew a common bond. .

’i‘he whales have gone. Maybe they will n
it to lower California, maybe they went; but the;
left a lovely legacy behind—(c1988.)

More Bobcats Freed on Cumberland

Park Service Returns 6 of the Predators to Native Habitat

By Jingle Davis

Special to the joumal-C(mslitution

CUMBERLAND ISLAND, Ga. —— The

bobcat was not in a cooperative mood when-

Dr. Robert Warren opened the door of her
plywood prison Thursday and offered her
freedom in the wilderness of the Cumber-
land Island National Seashore.

She and five other bobcats were
brought to Cumberland by boat Thursday
and set free because the National Park Ser¥
vice wants to reintroduce a native predator.
The island lost its: last bobcat to hunters
more than 80 years ago.

But this cat had no interest in human
goals. Her release proved more eventful
than the rest.

She crouched in the darkest corner of'
her traveling box, wide-eyed and making
sounds like a large propane burner. She re-
fused to come out, even when Dr. Warren
gently prodded her with a leafy branch bro-
ken from a wax myrtle thicket in a dune
swale near Cumberland’s 18-mile-long
beach. - ,

The cat snarled and slashed and Dr.

.Warren hastily withdrew the branch, gazing

Frustrated, he lifted the box and shook
the bobcat out. She dropped almost on his
feet and crouched, 12 or 13 muscular
pounds of tawny fury, glaring at his unpro-

tected legs. Dr. Warren leaned cautiously

around the box to see what the cat was do-
ing.

The two eyed each other warily for
what seemed ages.

“It’s a Mexican standoff,” Dr. Warren
murmuredﬁ

He slowly edged away, giving the bobcat
a clear path to the sheltering woods. Real-
izing their freedom, all the other bobcats
had streaked into the underbrush, but the
female, in control to the end, stalked slowly
through the thick grass toward the trees,
never once looking back.

Earlier, on the boat ride to Cumber-
land, Dr. Michael Conroy, an adjunct pro-
fessor at the University of Georgia’s School
of Forest Resources, had said the bobcats
were under stress from their capture and
transport.

Most of the animals were trapped in
mainland coastal areas by Duane Diefen-

Victoria Herberta’s days of swine and roses
apparently are numbered.

The city of Houston thinks it’s time for Jeffrey
Jerome, the 700npound son of Priscilla the Swim-
ming Pig and current houseguest of Herberta, to
retire to the country. ‘

Herberta, who has kept pigs at her inner-city
house since 1984, must appear in Municipal
Court Dec. 8 and faces a $200-a-day fine unless
her pal Jerome hoofs it outside the city limits, the
city Health Department says.

Jerome and Herberta have other plans.

He’d rather loll about on the porch of his home
on Crawford Street, sipping sodas and pigging
out on hot dogs, grapes and peppermint candy.
She prefers to baby her hog, bathing him in her
tub, brushing his teeth and letting him nap in her
bed occasionally. Will Herberta comply with Sec-

she ate morning glories and went into a
drug-induced stupor. She was replaced at the

tion 6~ll of the city ordinance and move
Jerome outside the city limits? In a pig’s eye,
she says.

City officials say they’re prepared to play
the heavy in this case, all in the name of
enforcing the law.

“We can laugh about it and look-at it as
comical,” says Dr. Robert Armstrong, whose
office issued Herberta a citation Tuesday.
“But we don’t have to live next door to a
plg.”

Jerome is not just any pig, says Herberta,
49. He is the offspring of Priscilla, who saved
a child from drowning in Lake Somerville in
1984 by diving in and swimming with him
back to shore.

The highly decorated and famous Priscilla
retired to a farm in San Marcos in 1985 after

 

Crawford Street house by her sister, Priscilla
II, wno filled in for her famous sister at pub—
lic functions before taking to the country
herself in 1987.

Jeffrey Jerome, known as Jerome, came
to live with Herberta Aug. 9, 1987, and has
lived in Herberta’s house and on her porch
since then.

Snowy white, with one blue eye and one
brown eye, Jerome has become a tourist
attraction visited by a handful of curious
each day.

He’ll be the drawing card at 1 pm. Sunday
when Herberta holds a fund-raiser to benefit
the homeless.

“He’s not just any pig. His mother saved a
human life and look how I’m being reward-
ed,” says Herberta.

“A pig is a pig is a pig,” rejoins Arm-
strong. “This may be a VlPig but it’s still a
pig.”

A neighbor who hasn’t been identified
complained to City Councilman Rodney El-
lis’ office about Jerome, saying he was
“filthy and dirty,” according to Herberta.

Ellis says he passed the complaint on to
the health department because even the son
of a swimming pig cannot be exempt from
city laws. ‘

“I for one certainly would not be amena-
ble to any sort of exception to the city ordi-
nance,” said Ellis, who added he was willing
to allow Jerome to continue living in Hous-
ton through Sunday to attend the fund-raiser
at 4208 Crawford.

“Anything beyond that,”

Ellis said,
“would be a pig in the poke.”

I am truly appalled at the latest
action taken by the Colorado Divi-
sion of Wildlife concerning deer
hunting at the U .8. Air Force Acad-

I found The Denver Post’s ac-

count of this terrible situation eye-
opening.
- The article stated that wildlife
biologist Tony Tovilitis of the Uni-
versity of Colorado and Robin Dux-
bury, director of the Rocky Moun-
tain Humane Society, found no
cause for these brutal and inhu-
mane killings.

I have visited the Academy on
several occasions. The deer are
not only tame; they seem to trust-
humans completely. In addition,
the vegetation in no way appears
depleted.

Why don’t we just send the 80 or
more merry hunters to the Denver
Zoo? Wouldn’t that be sporting
fun?

Once again, humans fail to real-
ize how fragile our ecosystem truly
is. When you blindly disregard the
natural survival of our priceless
creatures, you are most assuredly
killing the human race.

Court Stiffens Rule for Adopting Wild HorSes

 

I

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1 (AP) — A
Federal “adopt-a-horse” program that
is supposed to protect wild horses and
burros is actually sending some of
them to slaughter, an appeals court has
ruled in upholding restrictions on the
program.

The Bureau of Land Management
“renders the adoption process a farce”
by failing to screen out owners whose
intention is killing the horses for use as
pet food, the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit said in its
3-to-0 ruling Monday.

The decision prohibits the bureau
from transferring title of any wild

'horse or burro to a person who is

known to intend'commercial exploita~
tion through slaughter or use of the ani-

. mal in a rodeo.

The court did not say what steps the
Government agency must take to learn
the intent of a potential owner. But the
ruling was hailed by animal rights or-

' ganizations, who filed the lawsuit.

In Washington, a spokesman for the
Bureau of Land Management said to-
day that it had not seen the opinion and

 

had no response on what action it

 

 

might take.

Cleveland Amory, a founder and the
president of the Fund for Animals, one
group involved in the lawsuit, said,
“We were'determined from the start
that the blood money of these ‘national
treasures,’ as the. Wild and Free—
Roaming Horse and Burro Act defined
these animals, should not end in the
hands of already .amply paid profi-
teersf’

Mr. Amory, a writer, said it was also
important that the court had recog-
nized the right of animal rights organi-
zations to challenge the bureau’s man-
agement of animals.

Craig James, a lawyer for the Fund
for Animals, said the ruling could
determine the fate of many of the esti-
mated 8,000 wild horses that had been
adopted in the last year. Under a bu-
reau policy challenged in the lawsuit,
the agency did not inquire as to the in-
tentions of an adopter who had taken
humane care of a horse for a year.

Most of the horses are in Nevada, but
Mr. James said they could be found
over a wide area west of the Rocky
Mountains.

 

A 1971 Federal law described the
wild horses as “living symbols of the
historic and pioneer spirit” and or-
dered protective measures for the ani-
mals on public land. Later laws set up
the adoption program, under which
people could pay the Government. $125
a horse and $75 a burro for the right to
tame up to four animals for riding or
for other uses.

Agency Said It Had Power A

Animal rights groups filed suit in
1985 after the bureau said it would
waive fees for animals that were con—
sidered “unadoptable.” In response to
the lawsuit, the bureau conceded that it
had allowed adoption of horses by
some people who intended to have the
animals slaughtered or to exploit them
commercially in some other way.

But the Government agency argued
that it had acted within its authority,
since another Federal law allowed the
humane destruction of wild horses that

could not be adopted. .- ,9

exotic menu at
Miami’s Metrezoo

ATTY LEON HAS DIED AND GONE TO

heaven, or so the story goes according to
Mike Gerlach, the zareiogical supervisor at
Miami's Metrozoo, where Patty is responsi-
ble for feeding some 1,300 animals.

“Anyhow, Patty dies and goes to heaven
and there’s God at the Pearly Gates,” Ger-
lach says. “Only God is this giant rabbit —
and he‘s really mad.”

“Very funny,” Patty Leon says, smiling
and leaning back in her battered chair in
the Metrozoo kitchens.

The God-as-a—rabbit story is the sort of
grotesque M*A*S*H humor that goes with
the territory when you prepare daily din-
ners for more than a thousand wild animals
— many of which survive by eating their
smaller brethren in the food chain.

 

..s.

But zookeepers are kinder than Mother
Nature, which is why most meals are
served dead at Metrozoo.

It’s part of Fatty Leon’s job to kill thou-
sands of rabbits, mice and baby chicks each
week as dinners for a variety of creatures
who savor that sort of thing.

“We use a C02 gas,” she explains “It's
the most humane way.”

“Yesterday we did more than a hundred
pounds of rabbit,” adds Freddy Cohen,
who assists Leon. “A rabbit takes about 30
seconds. Mice, being small, are a lot
quicker.”

THIS ISN’T YOUR ORDINARY KITCHEN.
True, it’s open and clean, with all the
preparation areas spotless and shining.
But, while each meal is prepared individ—

ually, the ingredients differ radically from
what you’d find at, say, Morrison’s Cafete-
ria. And almost everything is served, well,
rare. Very rare.

Take, for example, the worms and crick-
ets that are served to dozens of birds in the
200's spacious aviary.

“They‘re still alive when the birds eat
them," notes Cohen. “The birds like them
better that way.”

And it’s the same with the snakes, most
of which will pass up a dead dinner.

“Once in awhile you can fool a snake by
serving it a dead mouse that‘s still warm,”
Cohen says. “But snakes like them better
when the mice are alive. Of course, we
always stun the mice first.”

Cohen has been feeding animals for 27
years —— first at the old Crandon Park 200
on Key Biscayne, and now at Metrozoo,
which opened in southwest Dade County in
1981.

“I’ve eaten just about everything we
feed our animals,” Cohen admits. “And
some of it’s not too bad.”

No, he hastens to add, he has not eaten a
live mouse or a wiggling wax worm.

“But I did try some aardvark slop a few
times,” he says. “It was quite good.”

Aardvark slop is pretty much what it
sounds like, Cohen says.

“You make it in a blender,” he explains.
“It’s like a real thick milkshake of dog
food, raw eggs, honey, vitamins and Carna—
tion milk.”

In the wild, aardvarks prefer a diet. of
termites and ants —— delicacies not nor-
mally sold in Western society.

Some of these “delicacies” are easy to
come by. For instance, you can buy all the
crickets you want. for $24 a thousand from
Selph’s Cricket Ranch in Tennessee.

 

 

 




 

 

 

The crickets are sent by mail. Once a
bunch got loose in the Miami Post Office,
Patty Leon recalls, and she had to go round
them up.

But ants and termites?

“They’re hard to come by,” Freddy Co-
hen says. “That’s how we came up with
aardvark slop.”

OTHER ANIMALS ARE MUCH MORE
finicky than aardvarks, Leon says.

Koala bears, for example.

“They’ll only eat eucalyptus leaves,” she
says. “And only very fresh leaves right off
the tree.”

Luckily, Florida abounds with pungent
eucalyptus imported years ago from the
koalas’ native Australia. That’s why
Metrozoo is one of only two zoos in the
United States (the other is San Diego) that
features the lovable, slow—moving koalas.
They’re not bears, actually, but marsupials
with a backpack-style pouch for carrying
their young.

“Eucalyptus only grows in very warm
climates," Leon explains. “A zoo up north
that wanted to have koalas would need a
huge greenhouse where they could raise
eucalyptus trees year—round. The cost
would be prohibitive.”

Koala keepers Linda Owen and Connie
Philipp spend more than an hour a day in

the 200’s grove, harvesting eucalyptus
branches for the pug-faced marsupials.
“You need about 12 branches per koala,”
Philipp says. “They go through about 2%
pounds of eucalyptus leaves every day.”

What the koalas don’t know is this: after
Owen and Philipp pick the eucalyptus
branches they attach them to a fiberglass
tree, which the bears think is real.

EACH ANIMAL AT METROZOO HAS UNI-
que eating habits.

“You must never handle a boa after it
eats,” Patty Leon explains. “It can get indi-
gestion and throw up.”

Huge-winged condors and vultures are
the 200’s gourmets of fetid cuisine; they let
their horse meat “breathe” after it’s
served, believing that dead meat, like fine
Wine, improves with age.

Flamingos eat a blend of rabbit chow,
trout chow, sawdust-like shrimp meal and
Nekton, a vitamin supplement that adds
color to their vibrant pastel-pink feathers.

The European White Stork (yes, the kind
that is reputed to bring babies) dines daily
on a dinner of two dead chicks, four diced
herring, 250 grams of stripped horse meat
and a bird-of—prey blend of ground corn
meal and bone.

“They need the roughage from the bone
and feathers," Leon says. “Without it, they

have bowel problems.”

The 200’s exotic dinner menu makes you
wonder where Noah stored all those vict-
uals on his ark.

“We go through 5,300 pounds of hay
trucked in from Michigan every week for
our stock animals,” Leon says. “Our pro-
duce comes from the same company that
sells to Publix and Winn—Dixie, but I never
accept anything too ripe or bruised."

Standards must be maintained.

Bears, for example, like their fish whole.
“They eat them like Popsicles,” Leon says.

All the animals dine far better than their
brethren in the Wild.

Bears are fed a daily multi-course meal
in their own individual serving tray: one
orange (cut in half); one large herring; 3/:
pound of bear biscuits and a large chunk of
processed horse meat served meatloaf
style.

The horse meatloaf is actually made for
big cats like lions and tigers, but the bears
enjoy it, too.

“I’ve eaten just
about everything we
feed our animals,”
says zookeeper Freddy
Cohen. “And some
of it’s not too bad.”

The horse meat itself comes from the
Nebraska Brand Horsemeat Company.

“Most of the company’s horse meat goes
to Europe, where people eat it,” Leon says.
“Only about 20 percent. goes to zoos. It’s all
USDA inspected.”

Horse meatloaf sells for 41 cents a
pound. A lion will eat about $2.50 worth of
the meatloaf a day, plus chunks of real
horse meat, vitamins and bones.

Animals are never overfed. First, be-
cause it’s bad for their health; second, be-
cause a hungry animal is more manageable
when the payoff is food.

“That’s how we move them from the
open areas into their cages for the night,”
Leon explains. “We use the food to lure
them in."

METROZOO IS VERY MUCH A STATE—OF—
the-art facility, where animals spend most
of their time in controlled areas landscaped
to look similar to their native habitats.

Miami’s famed white Asian tigers, for
exampl \. spend their days in a lush Asian
setting, complete with a fiberglass replica
of a lzit‘l'i—century shrine in fabled Angkor
Wat. V

At the end of the day, nearly all the
animals are. brought in for the night and
housed —— for their safety in immacu-
late. air-conditioned cages and stalls.

Most animals are fed at the end of the
day, after the visitors leave.

“Do Not Feed the Animals” signs are
everywhere, again for the animals’
protection.

“People will feed them everything from
film containers to candy bars still in the
wrappers,” Leon says.

Like most zookeepers, Leon and Cohen
aren’t sure who’s more deserving of captiv—
ity — the “dangerous” animals or their
“civilized” visitors.

“At one zoo —-— not ours —— they caught
people trying to feed the bears apples with
razor blades buried inside,” Cohen says,
shaking his head.

Even a well—meaning visitor can harm an
animal by ignoring the “Do Not Feed”
signs.

“Humans carry germs that can make
some of these animals very sick," Cohen
explains. “Even a simple cold can cause
trouble.”

Some of the animals are almost irreplace-
able, such as the rare white tigers. Others
are endangered species, like the Baird’s
tapir, one ofonly 23 in four American zoos.

Even if an animal could be replaced. the
cost might be prohibitive. For example,
Metrozoo’s Indian rhinos (a gift. of state

from Nepal) are valued at $100,000 each.

“Gone are the days when zoos encour-
aged the public to feed animals,” says zoo—
logical supervisor Mike Gerlach. “People
enjoy it, but the risk is too great.”

At Metrozoo, the zookeepers are assigned
to work with specific animals.

“That way the animal becomes familiar
with the same person, while the zookeeper
learns to read the animal’s behavior and
recognize any problems it may have,” he
explains.

“Of course, it’s only natural that some of
our zookeepers and the animals become
quite close over the years.”

Zookeepers are required to follow strict
procedures when feeding their wards.

“Hand feeding just isn’t permitted, no
matter how docile the animal seems,” Ger-
lach says.

“They lost a keeper at the Bronx Zoo just
last year,” notes Freddy Cohen. “The guy
got too close and a tiger dragged him into
his cage.”

METROZOO’S ANIMAL POPULATION OF
more than 2,800 creatures continues to
grow almost daily —-— thanks in part. to the
controlled, open-air environments.

“Animals that reproduce in captivity are
animals that feel secure,” Gerlach says.
“We’ve. had some wonderful success in that
area.”

The new arrivals recently led Metrozoo
to launch a program that enables area resi-
dents to “adopt” an animal for a year by
picking up the. tab for its meals.

Prices vary according to size and eating
habits. Thus it costs only $25 to become the
adoptive parent of a boa constrictor. But
serving as daddy to a lowland gorilla will
set. you back $2,500 a year.

And —— just in case you’re wondering —
a Metrozoo adoptee does not qualify as a
dependent in the eyes of the IRS be it the
pot-bellied pig ($100 a year) or the Bengal
tiger ($1,000 a year).

Wolf enlivens,

festivities '
Ninth pumpkin parade
numbers 66 entries I ,

By Rutharme Gilbert
and Kristi Ellis
The Arizona Republic

A wolf, chihuahua and ferret were transformed
into creatures of All Hallow’s Eve on Saturday at
the second-annual Petsmart photo days and costume
contest. -

Across town, black and orange balloons dotted
the sky as pumpkins, clowns and mice danced in the
streets and tossed candy to hundreds of children at
the ninth-annual pumpkin parade.

Petfood Warehouse, 1813 W. Bell Road, was one
of three stores in the chain holding pet-costume
events. The contests will continue today at the Bell
Road location and at stores in Tempe and
Scottsdale. The ﬁnals will be held Thursday night at
the Arizona State Fair, McDowell Road and 19th
Avenue. , '

One entry was Cinnabar, who is 91 percent wolf
and 9, percent. malamute. He sported granny glasses
and a red checkered nightgown. His owner, Terri
Underwood, completed the ensemble as Little Red
Riding Hood by wearing a long red-velvet cape.

Underwood, who h0pes to eventually breed wolf
hybrids, created the idea to make people more aware
of the good side of wolves. She said that she thinks
wolves got a bad reputation from fairy tales and that
they are actually exceptional animals.

“1 think wolves are the most, beautiful animals,”
she said. ,

Another entry was Tanya, a 4-month-old ferret
who. was dressed as a dragon in a green suit with
black wings. Tanya’s owner, Nicholas Kraus, was
dressed as a wizard.

Gizmo, a 4-year-old, 3-pound chihuahua, donned
a 6-inch sombrero with a 3-inch burlap coffee bag
hanging from her neck. Gizmo’s owners, Gary and
Sharon Sheldon, said the dog was supposed to be
Juanita Valdez.

. " Phoenix Gazette
A horse is a horse — unless of course tin Page is a
'miniature horse. 5 ~ 4

Nona and Bill Welsch believe that. So do about 100
other members of the Arizona Miniature Horse.
"Association who gathered at the Welsch home
recently.

The miniature horse enthusiasts want to set people
straight. A miniature horse is a pet, not livestock,
they say.

They plan to try to convince city and county
officials in Arizona that miniature horses should be
permitted anywhere that cats and dogs are.

A regular horse is about 62 inches tall and weighs
about 1,200 pounds, Welsch says. Miniature horses
are less than 34 inches tall measured from the

shoulder to the ground, and weigh between 75 and

150 pounds. _
' “They are smaller than Some kinds of dogs. They
are very gentle and are not as dangerous as a dog
because they do not have canine teeth. They are great
with children and old people,” Welsch says.

- The Arizona «group is waiting to begin their
" campaign on behalf of miniature horses until after
Nov. 7. That is when Patty Fairchild goes to court in
Thousand Oaks, Calif, in what is seen as a
precedent-settin g case. ‘

Fairchild is fighting to keep her miniature horse,

Ragtime, on her 6,250-square-foot residential lot.

Fairchild met with the Arizona miniature horse
owners torally support for her cause.

Shawn Mason, an assistant city attorney for
Thousand Oaks, said Fairchild is violating a city
ordinance which says that livestock is not permitted
within 40 feet of a neighboring residence. .

Another ordinance which says that a horse is not
permitted on a lot of fewer than 20,000 square feet
was ruled as unconstitutional by a Thousand Oaks
municipal judge. Fairchild’s fight with Thousand
Oaks has taken nearly two years and she says she has
spent $15,000 in attorney fees.

Indt‘ne process, she has become something of an
international celebrity. She. has received letters of
support from Japan, France, Germany and Canada as

7 well as from le from throughout the United,
Stages. She hasxheggeared on the'SJoan Rivers Show,
"Hollywood Squares” and California talk shows.
Articles about Ragtime havebeen published in PeopIe
and Star magazines. ' . , ' , ,, .

Miniature horses may look and sound like a tiny
version of a regular horse, but they are not really
horse‘s,"Fairchild says. ' ' ~ .

"They don’t fit the definition for a horse in
dictionaries. The American Horse Assocration does
not recognize them as horses,” she says. (.1

The New World Dictionary defines a horse as any
of several varieties of (a) large, strong animal With
four legs, solid hoofs, and flowing mane and tail, long
ago 'idomesticated for drawing or carrying loads,

r riders.” . . . .
caAryiiiiiiiature horse has four legs, solid hoofs and a
flowing‘mane and tail. But they certainly are not
large and can’t be used fer carrying loads or riders,
Fairchild sa 5.

"It’s like 3domparing a cat to a lion. They are both
felines. A miniature horse and a regular horse are
both equines but should not be conSidered the same.
Miniature horses can not survive in the Wlld. They

depeiid upon man.”

Fairchild's miniature nurse, nagtime, is strictly a
pet to-her. . . .

"He’s my baby. He certainly i" not a farm animal,”
she says. . ,. , .,

The 29-inch, .120.pound mini-stallion can ride a
skateboard, play ball, dance, nods yes and no, waves,
counts, bows and unties shoe ' laces. He’s also
housebroken. He rides in the back of F airchild’s van
— gain a horse trailer. -

“_;;,eiijoy taking him to nursing homes and seeing
peo e who are lethargic come back to life. He once

.. sch is interested in , Fairchild’s situation
_’:e he wants to have more miniature horses on
perty. Glendale permits him to have three on

.e-acre property buthe wants_,to breed a couple

‘ =7

- 0f thigh and keep the offspring. ‘

But it appears unlikely that Glendale officials will

ease the restrictions voluntarily.

"There is a difference between a dog and a horse. It

i has to do with people’s expectations, peace and quiet
. and property values,

H

says Glendale assistant City
Attorney David Pennartz.

Linda McClanahan has about a dozen miniature

'horses at her one-acre Scottsdale home. Scottsdale

does not have any zoning regulations regarding
horses. .

“I saw a miniature horse once and immediately fell
in love. They are so sweet and so smart. They’re
inexpensive to feed too. You can feed six miniature
horses for what one regular horse eats.”

The popularity of miniature horses has increased
in recent years although the breed dates back
hundreds of years, says Mary Culbertson of the
American Miniature Horse Association.

They were brought from EurOpe to the United

, States in the early 18003 to pull carts out 'of coal

mines.

“About 40 years ago, people started liking these
little bitty horses for pets,” Culbertson says.

In the last three years, the number of .miniature
horses registered with her association has grown from -
nearly 10,000 to about 28,000. Miniature horses cost
between $3,000 and $25,000. _

Regarding whether miniature horses are livestock ,

-' ‘ “0r pets, Culbertson says:

"It’s up to individuals how they want to classify

their own animals and what they want to do about
the government. If they are not considered as a
livestock, they won’t beatax deduction.” - .
. Miniature horses will be featured during the Touch
of Class show beginning at 8 am. Nov. 19 at
Horseworld, 16601 N. Pima Road, Scottsdale. The
event is free.

More information about miniature horses is

available from Larry Strubar, president of the
7‘ Miniature Horse Association of Arizona at 465-9252
in New River.

There are about 200 miniature horses in the state;

Animal Park in 1972 and later gave

talks about her animals to 200 visi-
tors. -
“They wanted me to tell of the
good times,” Derby says. “But l
have to speak about what is hap-
pening now.

“Most people don’t include zoos
in the category of animal training,
” Derby says. ‘-‘But the San Diego
Zoo trains animals for on—site
shows and offers animal rides.”

Jouett says the 200’s performing
animals “are trained to show their
natural behavior. For example, an
otter will walk through a tube re-
sembling a hollow log, demonstrat-
ing its natural agility, or an owl will
fly silently in circles."

“There’s no training without
some negative reinforcement,”
Derby says. “To get an animal to
perform on cue requires cruelty. A
dog doesn’t willingly jump through
a hoop. A bear doesn’t want to
waltz.” She has not been a sideline
spectator in the animal world. “I’ve
personally done everything I’m
criticizing. I’ve learned by doing
wrong things.”

While working for animal train-
ers in Hollywood, she watched in
horror as they electroshocked ele-
phants; or broke the noses and
burned the feet of bears to establish
dominance. She began to ask ques-
tions: “Do we have the right to hurt
an animal that depends on us?”

Her colleagues told her to get
tough or get out. Her marriage to
animal trainer Ted Derby ended af—
ter a final argument over his insis-
tence on using an electric cattle
prod in training.

In 1978, Derby published The
Lady and her Tiger, exposing the
inside world of performing-animal
training. In 1985, she fought for
passage of a California law to im—
prove the regulation and inspection
of exotic-animal compounds state-
wide.

“l’ve been called anthropomor—
phic, a bleeding heart, and a victim
of the Bambi syndrome for raising
questions about animal treatment,
but it hasn’t quieted me,” Derby
says.

“Animals can’t speak for them-
selves. People have to speak for
them.”

HOUSTON POST - October 28, 1988

EX-trainer talks for t; 3.
fights in-cage abuse

‘ ry sticks (some reports said Keep-

By Arlene Mueller
CHRISTTAN SCIENCE MONITOR

ALT, CALIF. —— “There’s
nothing educational, stim-
ulating, or uplifting about

a bear riding a bicycle,” says Pat
Derby, a former Hollywood animal
trainer and stunt woman. “When
you train an animal to do some-
thing unnatural, you fall to the dec-
adent level of the Romans who ’
cheered the gladiators.

“If we need to confine exotic an—
imals at all, I believe they should be
left untrained to enjoy loving, daily
interactions with their keepers.”

Many people see Derby’s posi-
tion as extreme. After all, it would
mean the end of trained animals in
movies, theme parks, and zoos.
And when animal training is done
in a responsible atmosphere, it is
generally seen as'a fun-loving,
even wholesome activity.

Nevertheless, she is leading a
moral crusade, which, among other
activities, has involved her in a
state investigation of animal abuse
at the San Diego Zoo that probes
the fine line between animal disci-
pline and abuse.

Derby’s strong views come after
more than two decades of perform—
ing—animal experience: everything
from cleaning cages and bottle-
feeding newborn tigers to training
animals for such TV shows as Dak-
tari, Flipper and Gentle Ben. She
and her husband produced the first
Lincoln-Mercury Sign of the Cat
commercial. Her animals also were
used in Honda, Kal Kan, and Pur-
ina ads and appeared in dozens of
films, including Walt Disney’s The
Love Bug, plus television series
such as The Waltons, Gunsmoke,
and Lassie.

Four years ago Derby put her
philosophy to work on a small
ranch in northern California, where
she founded PAWS (the Perform-
ing Animal Welfare Society), a re-
tirement home for performing ani-
mals. It also was turned into a
shelter for homeless animals, in-
cluding a wolf, a coyote, two leop-
ards, and a runt African elephant
named “71” that couldn’t keep up

 

 

with the herd on a Florida million-
aire’s ranch.

Derby talks with each ofthe 15
animals in a unique, imitatiye “lan—
guage,” pausing to let Harriet the
baboon groom her through the
cage bars, and handing‘ 7] a
hose so she can spray herself. She
and partner Ed Stewart keep

round-the-clock watch on the ani—
mals in the spacious, clean cages.
PAWS is nonprofit and claims near-
ly 2,500 members.

Strangers driving down the
country road would never guess
that behind the ordinary ranch—
style house with a cracked drive-
way is a miniature zoo. Here, in
this peaceful kingdom, Derby plans
a strategy for her fight to improve
the lives of exotic animals in Cali-
fornia. .

Right now she’s optimistic. At
the close of the August California
legislative session, Democratic
state Sen. Dan McCorquodale an-
nounced he would form a study
group consisting of 200 personnel,
federal and state agency officials,
and public-interest groups to deal
with the question of exotic-animal
care.

This question surfaced at the
July 29 hearing into the alleged
mistreatment of Dunda, an African
elephant at the San Diego Zoo’s
Wild Animal Park. Derby, who
starred in the public hearing, is
heartened by the public outcry and
says she believes the incident has
united animal rights supporters.

The hearing revealed that in
February, Dunda, an 18-year-old
African elephant, was disciplined
with beatings by her handlers at the
Wild Animal Park. Reports of the
beatings -— more than 100 blows
to the head over two days —
sparked investigations by the San
Diego Zoological Society, the Hu-
mane Society of the United States
and the San Diego Humane Soci-
ety.

Zoo officials decided to move
Dunda from the 200, after 1 1 years,
to the nearby 1,800-acre Wild Ani-

' mal Park because her “highly ex-

citable” and “defensive” personal-
ity made her difficult to manage in

the 7-92- After the move. Dunda

lunged at a keeper with enough
force to break a tusk, threatening
the safety of her keepers, until Alan
Roocroft, the park’s elephant train-
ing supervrsor, decided to disci-
pline her “in a manner that would
get the most effect and cause
Dunda the least harm.” j
During the next two days, six
trainers short—chained her legs,
brought her to a kneeling position,
and hit her on the head with hicko-

ers used ax handles and elephant
hooks), shouting, “Dunda, no!
Dunda, no!”

Zoo officials maintain that beat-
ings are an acceptable form of ele—

phant management and offered no

apologies for the incident. Roocraft
defended the session, saying keep-
ers struck the elephant’s head rath-

er than her limbs to avoid perma-

nent injury and let the animal see
who was administering the punish-
ment.»

' Witnesses at the hearing gave
varying views of the severity of the
beatings. Roocraft maintained the
discipline sessions did only superfi-
cial damage to Dunda’s head and
did not break the skin. But veteri-
nary reports from the San Diego
Humane Society investigation de-
scribe “excessive skin breakage”
and conclude “the discipline went
too far.”

Jeff Jouett, publicist for the Zoo-
logical Society of San Diego, the
private corporation operating the
zoo and park, says elephants are
accustomed to a group hierarchy.
“Elephants look to the keeper, ask—
ing who’s in charge. They may
challenge the control, but basically
they want a leader.” Beating is an
appropriate discipline for ele—
phants, he adds, because herd
members hit each other. “After all,
how much damage can a 180-
pound human do to a four-ton ani— ‘

mal?” On the other hand, ele-
phants’ great size endangers
trainers, so “keepers must domi-
nate.”

Derby disagrees. “Trainers say
that unless you dominate the ele—
phant it will kill you. But it’s the
trainers who make a killer elephant
by keeping the animal fearful and
dependent”

The hearing ended without
agreement. But after the Dunda in:
cident, the San Diego Zoological
Society announced that in the fu-

.. ture, Roocraft may recommend el-

ephant discipline but a zoo veteri-
narian and a curator will make the
decision. , . _ ~ .

 




5 ranches where exotics are hunted.

'But Palmer Krantz, the president
of the AAZPA, concedes that the
contributions of ranches canmi
be overlooked.

“The ranches have done a tre-
mendous job with some of the
species,” he said. “You cannot
ignore that. But you also cannot
ignore the fact that hunting is a
very emotional issue, especially in
urban areas.”

Rancher Dale Priour is one of
those who has worked to improve

the quality of his exotic animals,
including the barasingha deer and

the red lechwe antelope of South»

mnca. "1 am a nut for something
pure,” he explained.

But he also believes that the US.
government meddles far too much
with its regulations about endan-
gered animals, and that older bucks
should be shot as trophies so that
ranchers can support themselves
raising exotics. In the case of the
barasingha, he said, it took a full
three years to convince the US.
Department of Agriculture that he
should be able to cull aging bucks
for trophy stock.

“If they would back off and not ‘

' hobble us with rules and regula—

tions, [exotics] would multiply until ,
they are no longer endangered,” .

Priour said.
One of the oddities about Texas

exotics is that the state would.

rather not see them—endangered
species or otherwise—on Texas
ranches. The parks and wildlife
department’s primary responsibili-
ty is ensuring the continued sur-
vival of native game—in particular
the white-tailed deer. According to
tests the department'has conduct-
ed, exotic deer are hardier than the
white tail.

”We would rather there not be
any exotics around because they
are such tough competi ‘ '
the white tail,” said parks and
wildlife biologist Mike Reagan.

The white—tailed deer population
is hardly in danger, what with an
estimated 4.5 million of them in
Texas. But it is that protective
stance by state officials that keeps
Mike Hughes in business. He is the
owner of the Texas Wild Game
Cooperative, which operates out of
the tiny town of Ingram in the Hill
Country.

Hughes 15 marksman Glen Wam-
pler’s boss and makes his living in
the exotic game harvesting busi-
ness.

Six years ago, Hughes hit upon
the idea of using exotic animals as a
, commercial source of venison,

. which he markets as a healthier

‘ alternative to beef. He financed the
- construction of a portable slaugh-

~ terhouse, complete with a refriger- }

.ator that canmhold‘up to 50 carcas—

 

ses, that is taken to all the ranches
where exotics are hunted. And he
has agreed to pay for a state meat
inspector, who goes on every hunt.

Now, with business booming,
Hughes estimates that his hunters
take about 3,000 exotic deer a year
from 150 or so Hill Country ranch-
es. The deer are then processed and
sold for everything from prime cuts
to sausage. To those who object to
his line of work, Hughes points to
Europe and New Zealand, where
venison farms flourish.

Treated Differently
Hughes does not agree with

research findings that exotics en-

croach on the white tail’s habitat.
But he depends on that attitude
from the state, lest some kind of
restrictions be placed on exotic

‘hunting. The last thing he needs,

for instance, is a hunting season on
exotics.

“Virtually every animal we de-
pend on for food is an exotic,” said
Hughes, eating barbecue in an
Ingram cafe. “There were no cows
or goats or chickens or horses here
at one time. There is a tremendous
tendency for people to put a strong
division between conventional
livestock and an axis deer. It leads

- to an attitude that they should be

treated so much differently and I
don’t buy that.- '

“Right now is a particularly
sensitive period where people are
becoming more aware of exotics,”
he said. “The danger is that unless
people have an objective perspec-
tive, we could have some adverse
regulations.”

Though Hughes pays at most $2
a pound for a dressed-out deer,
ranchers see the increased interest
in venison as a boon to a ranch

economy that has had its share of ,

troubles—among them a slacken-
ing in the number of trophy hunt-
ers because of the depressed Texas
economy.

“The demand is there,” said the
YO’s Schreiner. “It’s- perfect tim—
1ng.” ‘

Meanwhile, the concept of rais-
ing exotics for venison seems to be
spreading. There are several deer
farms in Upstate New York and
Priour, the rancher, said he has

- received an order for 70 exotic deer

from a Seattle man who plans to
raise them there. Schreiner said he
recently attended an exotic game

; auction in Missouri and what he
i saw convinced him that raising ‘
g exotics would eventually be com- ‘
mon everywhere.

“It was the damnedest thing I’d

: ever seen,” he said. “It was Middle

America. It wasn’t a bunch of
people from hunting ranches. It

i was 95% farmers from Minnesota »

and Iowa and Missouri They aren t p
i doing it for fun. It’s an alternative;
é cash crop for their farms

A month after a Los Angeles County

. has disappeared from one of those shel-

ters.

The year-old Pomeranian. called

animal staffers at the Baldwin Park. and
Lancaster shelters lost track of about 211,351
animals in a one-month period. unable to
say if they were destroyed or stolen.

Miller, a nurse’s assistant, said her

' four-pound, $250 dog ran out of her yard

last Thursday. It was found by the

__Put up Martinez, Bambi
pictures as hunt reminder

Attention animal lovers: Hang up a

Q picture of Gov. Bob Martinez on your

mirror, along with one of Bambi, to
continually remind yourself that we
have a governor who approves of
children using guns to kill defense-
less animals.

I don’t know what Martinez’ aspi-
rations are, politically that is, but
whatever they may be, governor
again, representative or senator in
Washington, let’s all remember how
he said that the hunt should go on be-
cause it fosters closer relationships
between parents and their children.

Evidently the governor can’t think
of any other way to foster such rela-
tionships except to hand the kids
guns and say, “Go to it, kid, foster a

relationship with your dad.”

Wherever and whenever he raises
his political head again, let’s get out
in force all over the state and chop it
off for him.

Turn to Exotic Species

 

Rancitm in
Texas Hear
Call of Wild

By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY,
Times Staff Writer

MOUNTAIN HOME, Tex—The
spotlight cut through the night and
caught the silhouette and shining
eyes of the deer in the distance.
Glen Wampler rested his Styr
Mannlicher rifle on the half-
opened window of the pickup
truck. He was a dead shot from this
range and he sighted through the
high-powered scope.

Seconds passed as Wampler
waited for the deer to turn. Then he
squeezed the trigger. The deer fell
with a bullet to the head.

“My daddy never liked me to
waste ammunition,” said Wampler,
in the manner of a man who has
hunted for food rather than sport.
“And he always wanted me to
shoot for the neck or above.”

Food for Restaurants

In the course of the night, Wam-
' pler would fire the silencer-
equipped rifle 21 times and hit 18
deer. This is what he does, some-
times six nights a week. He shoots
deer—exotic deer—for meat that
eventually finds its way to restau-
rants from California to Florida.
Were he to shoot the indigenous
white-tailed deer like this—by
spotlight and out of season—

Wampler would soon find himself '

knee-deep in game wardens. But
because he hunts exotics on private
land, the deer fall into the same
category as farm animals, which is
to say they aren’t considered game
at all.

On this particular night, Wam-
pler concentrated on does because
ranch owner Don Otting said they
were fast outpacing the number of

bucks on his land.

“I thought I was a pretty good
‘ shot until these boys came along,”
.said Otting, who was driving the
pickup.

Giraffes and Ostriches

Exotics are animals that are not
native to a particular region. Here
in the Hill Country of Central
Texas, hundreds of ranches are

teeming with exotics and morer

ranches are getting into the busi-

ness all the time. Sika deer from
the Far East graze alongside Euro-
reea fallow deer and India’s axis
deer And on places such as the YO
rtanch near here, the likes of
giraffes, ostriches and zebras,
which are not hunted, share space
with Texas longhorns.

The most recent surVey, done in
1984, put the number of exotics at
more than 120.000 on 370 Texas
ranches. But Max Traweek, a Texas
Parks and Wildlife biologist
charged with making a new count
this year, is sure those figures have
increased. In fact, exotic game has
proliferated so much in the Hill
Country over the years that it has
its own name—Texotics.

Although many ranches now
raise exotic game that is systemati-
cally harvested for food, the most
lucrative part of the exotics busi-
ness has been accommodating tro-
phy hunters who can’t afford the
trip to Africa or India, and who
come to Texas instead.

That kind of hunting isn’t popu-
lar in all quarters, and critics
charge that fenced-in animals lose
a good deal of the edge they might

Eliave if they were‘stalked in the

wild. Even most Texotics ranchers
cringe at recent stories of “canned
hunts,” in which lions are released
from cages so they can be killed by
hunters.

“It’s not real common,” said Jim
Stinebaugh, an enforcement agent
with the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service in San Antonio. “But there
is no protection for an African lion

in Texas. I’d bet there are no more '

than 100 big cats killed in that
manner each year, but one is to
many. .
“I get calls from people because a
neighbor across the fence has a

Bengal tiger. They’re worried to

death.”

And there are those who object
to the shooting of any exotics.

“It’s a cheap way to go on safari,”
said Bill Mead of the Gulf States
office of the Humane Society. “It’s
really just getting a trophy to hang
on the wall. Everybody and his
brother seems to be getting into it
now.”

Exotic animals of all stripes have
been in Texas for decades and at
last count there were 94 different
species. The famous King Ranch in
South Texas was the first to intro-
duce exotics to the state when its
owners bought a few Indian nilgai
antelope in 1924 and released them
on the open range. Over the years,
other ranch owners, including
World War I ace Eddie Ricken-
backer, bought surplus animals
from zoos, keeping them more as
curiosities than as a source of
income. . '

But when a seven- year drought
hit Texas in the ’505, ranch owners
started thinking that. the ‘ exotic
animals on their land might be used

. to help make the mortgage pay-

ments. After the drought, the
Schreiner family, owners of the
legendary YO Ranch. began stock-

, ing more exotics as a hedge against
_ the vagaries of ranching.

As the story goes, a man once
came to the ranch and saw a black
buck antelope, an animal that he
had’ once hunted unsuccessfully in
India. He asked rancher Charles
Schreiner III how much he would
charge to hunt the antelope, a
descendant of surplus stock from

" the San Antonio zoo. Faced with a
’ huge debt from the drought,

Schreiner suggested $125 as a fair

price. That was the first time an
: exotic was hunted for a fee on the
1 YO. Now, such hunting is the
;‘ principal source of income for the
5 50,000-acre ranch. ‘

“It’s vital,” said Louis Schreiner,
the youngest of the Schreiner sons.
“If [the exotic animals] were all to
die tonight, it would probably ruin
us. We do everything we can that’s
ethical to make money off the
exotics.” .

He hopped into an open Jeep and
headed for the pasture where gi-
raffes nibbled on oak trees and an
ostrich looked on menacingly from
afar. Zebras munched hay in an-
other part of the field. These
animals are commonly known as
“superexotics.” They are off limits
to hunters but fair game for cam-
era—laden tourists who also con-
tribute to the ranch’s economy.
Other animals, however, whether a
North African aoudad or an Indian

. barasingha deer or a black buck
antelope, are there for the taking.

. And therein lies a paradox of

TeXotics.

Endangered in Pakistan
The black buck, for instance, is

; endangered in its native Pakistan.

But there are thousands of them in
Texas and they are hunted regular-
ly.’ The YO even flew 45 of the
animals to Pakistan in an attempt
to help replenish the species there.

The barasingha is on the endan-
gered species list, but it is hunted in
Texas because there is an over-
abundance of bucks on the ranches
that have nurtured such herds.

The aoudad sheep, with their

:curved horns and shy ways, are
becoming so plentiful that many

ranchers think of them more as
pests than as exotics.

Humane Society members com-
plain of the lack of fair chase. The
American Assn. of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums has a policy
against member zoos supplying

WASHINGTON —- The National
Wildlife Refuge System, federal
lands set aside. as havens for ani-
mals and migratory birds, is in
poor and deteriorating condition,
the Wilderness Society asserted
Thursday. ‘

The society, a national nonprofit
conservation group, said in a re-
port that the refuges had been bad-
iy neglected by the Reagan admin-
istration and are facing “a host of
problems” that are endangering
their ability to support wildlife.

These problems include dams
and other water projects, damage
by vehicles that can be driven on
,rough terrain, toxic chemicals
from agriculture and mining, oil
drilling and other commercial de-
velopment and military aircraft
training exercises, according to the
society.

‘Desperate plight

“The bottom line,” said George
Frampton, president of the society,
“is this: Our refuges are in a des—
perate plight, yet their cry for help
is barely heard. It is safe to say
that the condition of our wildlife
refuges is one of the great scandals
of American conservation.”

The report listed what the soci-
ety’s staff found to be the 10 most
“endangered” refuges in the na-
tional system.

They are, in no particular order,
the Great Swamp Refuge in Morris
County, 'N.J.; the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge in Alaska; Kester—
son in California; Chincoteague in

DENVER POST - October 28,

Virginia; Stillwater in Nevada;
National Key Deer and Loxahatch-
ee in Florida; the Upper Mississip—
pi Refuge in Wisconsin, Minnesota,
Illinois and Iowa; the Lower Rio
Grande in Texas, and the Yazoo
Refuge in Mississippi.

Criticisms disputed
Frank Dunkle, director of the

Fish and Wildlife Service, an arm

of the Interior Department, which
manages the wildlife refuges, dis-

puted the society’s criticisms.

“The situations cited by the Wil-
derness Society,” Dunkle said,
“are not new, nor are they being
ignored.

“The society seems to think we
can build a moat around each of

our 445 refuges to protect them

from pollution and other external
threats.

“Unfortunately, that is just not
possible.

“I wish, however, that the soci-
ety had given us and the Congress
more credit for what we are doing
to combat the problems identified
in their report.”

But at a news conference at the
society’s Washington headquarters
here, Frampton said that “dozens”
of the refuges in the 90-million acre
system were in serious trouble.

“Some of these places are ref-
uges in name only,” he asserted,
adding that some were actually le-

' thal for the wildlife that might try

to inhabit them

plosive devices to scare away wild-
life from the refuge because its

ponds, are contaminated with dead- '

ly selenium, arsenic and other tox-
ic substances caused by runoff of
irrigation water from nearby
farms.

Toxic runoff is also a grave
threat to wildlife at the Stillwater
and Upper Mississippi refuges.

The low-altitude flights and son-
ic booms of military aircraft flying
over and near the Stillwater Ref-
uge frighten water fowl and other
wildlife, the report said.

The ability of Chincoteague Is-
land to support wildlife is being
threatened by the number of dune

‘ Automobiles kill up to 20 percent":
of the endangered deer population

The society called for a series of
actions to protect the refuge sys-'
tem, including legislation thatj
would give the system special sta-~
tus and an overall integrity similar -
to that of the National Park Sys—
tem, which is shielded by a law'-
that requires the parks to be pre--.
served “unimpaired for the enjoy-;
ment of future generations.”

Frampton said the current $118~~
million annual budget for manag-k
ing the refuges is only a fraction of
what is spent by the government in‘
national forests each year to build’
roads for timber companies. " '

Hunting was banned in Kenya in

being poached for their ivory at a
rate of at least 150 per week, con-
servationists estimate. Kenya’s
dwindling elephant population,
* which has declined by 85 percent in
‘ 15 years, is now put at about
16,000, according to a recent gov-

President Daniel arap Moi, in
response to the crisis, decreed in
September that all poachers would
be shot on sight. He also ordered
that all mining and prospecting op-
erations within the parks be sus-
pended. Since then, government
police have rounded up dozens of
suspected poachers.

Less than a month after the pres-
ident’s shoot-to-kill order, howev-
er, 11 more dead elephants were

P

The poachers are believed to be
aided by corrupt game wardens,
rangers, itinerant cattle herders
and ivory traders who supply the
poachers with trucks and places to
hide.

“Clearly, if you are in a national
park with people going in with
trucks and automatic guns and
saws and coming out with tusks,”
Mr. Leakey said, “then there must
be collusion.”

Outfitted with automatic weap-
ons gathered from East Africa’s
many civil wars, the poachers are
able to kill large groups of ele-
phants in a short period of time.

“There is very little question that
certain branches of government —
including the police —— have turned
a blind eye to what’ 5 going on,”
said David Western, a Nairobi con-
servationist.

Since September, more than 40
rangers and wardens in the Depart-
ment of Wildlife Management have
been charged with corruption or
collusion with poachers. Sixty oth-
ers are said to be under investiga-
tion, and the present minister,
George Muhoho, has promised fur-
ther prosecutions.

This is not the first time, howev-
er, that the department has tried to
correct its abuses. Early this year it
dismissed more than a dozen senior
bureaucrats and wardens who were
alleged to have been poaching or
collaborating with poachers. The
minister in charge of the depart~
ment was also relieved of his duties.

Many of those rangers and war-
dens have since been reinStated.
Sources close to the department say
that bureaucratic and political con—
siderations, as well as family and
tribal loyalties, continue to make it
hard to dismiss corrupt officers.

 




 

 

Fine
Feathered
Friends at the
Dallas Zoo

At the Dallas Zoo, Dennis Smith
nods admiringly toward the Harris’
hawk perched on his gloved hand. “If
we had her eyes, we could read the
newspaper headlines about a half mile
away,” he says. “And in the falcon
family, you’re talking about birds that
come down out of the sky at 150 to 200
mph That’s moving.”

Smith, director of the Dallas-based
Raptor Education Program, and his
wife, Dottie, care for injured birds of
prey in the Dallas area. The raptors
are featured in a program at the Dal-
las Zoo on Labor Day weekend as
part of the 200’s First Weekend se-
ries of special events.

The Birds of Prey presentation in-
. cludes ﬂight demonstrations, ﬁlms, and
lectures covering such topics as bird
identiﬁcation and the care of injured
fowl. With a large bird collection and
several recent successes in breeding
rare species, the Dallas Zoo is a per-
manent home for many raptors, in-
cluding a pair of injured bald eagles.

“I try to help get people to observe
what’s already around them in the
wild,” Smith says. “Between Dallas
and the Oklahoma state line, you can
see a red-tailed hawk on almost every
other telephone pole. You can drive
I-635 around Dallas and see between
30 and 50 red-tailed hawks and be-
tween 20 and 40 American kestrels.
And for eVery red-tailed hawk you see,
back off in the woods, sleeping the day
away, is a great horned owl. The
hawks are the day shift, and the owls
are the night shift.” ,

Smith says that getting people to
recognize birds of prey has helped re-
duce the number of people-related in-
juries to raptors. “In the last ﬁve years
that we’ve been giving programs,
we’ve seen gunshot wounds decrease
dramatically,” he notes. “We still get
quite a few poison victims. Many af-
fected are screech owls. They live right
in the cities and eat insects with insecti-
cide in them.”

In addition to raptors, the Dallas

Zoo is home for more than 500 other
birds, including over a dozen endan-
gered species. Habitats have been im-
proved and planted with trees, brush,
and grasses for cover. “If you put birds
in a sterile cage, they’re usually not
going to breed,” says zoologist Chuck
Siegel. “Partly because of the botanical
improvements, we’ve had tremendous
success with the breeding program.
We have recently bred dozens of
species that haven’t bred at the zoo
in decades.”

Last year, the ﬁrst goliath herons'

ever born in captivity in ,North
America—the ﬁrst born in any 200 in
the world since the early 1900’s—

hatched at the Dallas Zoo. Two more .

birds were born last spring, making a
total of ﬁve the zoo has raised so far.
Native to the area south of the Sa-
hara in “Africa, the goliaths are the
largest of all herons.

 

The goliath herons are destined to
join the Dallas Zoo’s major expansron,
called the Wilds of Africa. In this new
exhibit area, scheduled to open in July
1989, visitors will be able to ride a
monorail to see animals and birds in

large open spaces.

The Birds of Prey program is Sep-
tember 3-5. Other 1988 First Weekend

food, prodding around for it with their
capable ﬁngers instead of having it
served up regularly on a plate. They
"learned to be wary of stinging insects
and to avoid predators. Yet despite all
that rehearsing, when they reached
their patch of Brazilian forest they
didn’t want to leave their cages. After
all, that was a jungle out therel

"Their reluctance to venture out,"
says Beck, f'was one of the things that
suggested trying free release on the
grounds of the Zoo."

So the Zoo people tried the experiment
with a 1986 group of GLTs. The ani-
mals were immobilized, ﬁtted with tiny
radio transmitters and given individual
markings to make life easier for their
human monitors. Then, still in the cage
nesting box they'd always known, they
were placed in the trees. "And when
they woke up,” Beck recalls, “they were
in our own little 'forest.’ "

They stayed in the box for a day, just
poking their noses out. They seemed to
like their new view of the Zoo, and on
the second day they promptly took off in
all directions. Thanks to the radio
transmitters, the GLT-watchers rounded
them up and got them back to their
home box. From then on,‘they stayed
put, basing their wanderings on the box,
always returning to it. '

Ropes were strung to get them used
to jungle branches and vines. They
cross them like squirrels once they learn
how. At ﬁrst, as I learned, they couldn’t
cope with the flex and bounce of live
branches. They also didn’t know how to
peel a banana. “They were used to hav-
ing it cut up for them,” says Beck. "Now
we hoist real bananas into the trees with
pulleys, and let the animals ﬁnd and eat
. them. In 1987, we tried the same free-re-
lease training in Brazil with some GLTs
from another zoo that were about to be
reintroduced into their native habitat.
They did well. Obviously, the technique
works, and it’s cost-effective as well."

Apparently the GLTs can get pretty
cocky about their freedom. My old
friend Billie Hamlet, who works with
Mike in the Zoo's public affairs ofﬁce,
told me that one Sightseer, spotting the
GLTs in a tree, put her handbag down
so she could snap a picture. What she
didn't see through her viewﬁnder was
one daring tamarin who crawled into
the bag, rummaged amid Kleenex, keys
and lipstick, then scurried away before
she turned around.

But this free-release experiment-—

As he usually does, Mike Morgan was
driving me around the National Zoo in
one of those enlarged golf carts the staff
, uSes—noisy, barely controllable, yet just
slightly convenient. We wound through

kindergartners and college students, and -

he shouted at me above the complaints
of his vehicle. I heard little until we
slowed for a turn onto a wooded path-
way. "This is where we'll see them," he
yelled over to me.

A group of Zoo-goers lined the side of
the path, staring into a patch of tall
trees. Ropes, lashed high among the
branches, were draped from trunk to
trunk. Hands suddenly pointed up into
the foliage. Lurching to a stop, we left
our little engine to die in peace and
joined the crowd.

More pointing, more excited voices:
"There! There’s one of them!" I made
out what looked like a large birdhouse
built against a tree trunk, supported by
boughs. From it hung an animal’s tail.

Then the creature turned, and I recog- ?
nized the small red-maned face, intent 5
and wary, of that beautiful, highly en- ..
dangered South American monkey, the ..

golden lion tamarin.

“This is what I’ve been telling you,"
said Mike. "We impose no restraints.
They just wander freely around this
part of the Zoo, getting used to living in
trees so they can be reintroduced into
their native habitat in Brazil."

I knew that since the early 19705, the
National Zoo had joined with Brazil
to lead the way in rescuing the little
squirrel-size “GLTs,” as they're called,
from the brink of extinction. I also
knew that since 1984, GLTs from this
and many other American and Euro-
pean zoos had been reintroduced to
preserved remnants of their natural
Brazilian forest.

that would resemble the branches and
vines (arboreal pathways) of their Bra-
zilian forest. Ropes cross over the busy
pedestrian paths (gaps in the forest), “so
the GLTs won’t endanger themselves by
traveling on the ground or cause trouble
by jumping into baby carriages and
swiping paciﬁers," said Mike.

The group of seven that I met had
been released two months before and

were still pretty timid. But they were .
beginning to venture away from their '

nesting box (a BO-quart plastic picnic

cooler, chosen because of its excellent
thermal properties and light weight)
into the big world. By the time you read
this, they’ll be just about ready to tackle
Brazil. By all accounts, the visitors will
miss them. The Zoo staff looks on their
departure more ambivalently.

"They're such feisty little animals,"
said one of the FONZ volunteers whose
job it is to keep an eye on things and
record crowd interest (high). “One
female went after a gray squirrel. The
squirrel fought back, and the GLT’s calls
attracted the whole clan, which then

3 banded together to drive the squirrel

away. The female was so exhausted that
she spent the rest of the day hanging
over the entrance to the nesting box."
Nearby, Vania Nunes, a Zoo intern
from Brazil, held a radio antenna with
which she could track the movements of
three GLTs that were wearing collars
with transmitters. "They haven’t crossed
over the visitor walkways yet," she said.
"But we remember how bold they get
later on. They go all over the place.

They'll probably visit the panda yard, _

like last year’s group."

Family life is important for GLTs.

forced to leave the nest."
. Rufus and Emily’s oldest daughter
i was Kuff. She stayed with the family to
ilearn parenting when the next babies
were born; then she didn't want to leave.
Emily, however, was adamant. Their
voices rose in shrieks of conflict, and
ﬁghting and chasing ensued—adolescent
daughter versus mother. "It was just too
much for Rufus," said Mike. He fol-
lowed mother and daughter as they
fought, became disoriented, got lost and
spent the night out.

Emily—and the GLT way of life—
won in the end. Out Kuff went, only to
try once again to return—an attempt
that prompted the intervention of the
Zoo. She was trapped and taken to a
holding area to await pairing with a
young male. She’s still waiting. Oh well,
no one ever promised her a rose garden.

New siblings arrived: Niko, Mariah,

‘_ Opie, Petie, Sandy . . . I think that's all, '
.' but I’m pretty bewildered. Somehow

: they all packed into that nest house and
apparently got along just ﬁne even dur-
ing one of D.C.’s worst-ever hot spells.

When this turbulent family ships out

g to Brazil this fall its members will have
a strong advantage over the ﬁrst 13 200-
: bred—and Zoo-trained—GLTS released
there in 1984. Benjamin B. Beck, assis-
3' tant director for animal exhibits at the
i National Zoo, points out that there’s as

much difference between training in
the cage and entering the real forest as
there is between ﬂying a ﬂight simula-
tor and getting into the cockpit of an
airplane. “What’s more," Beck says, “it
was expensive, timeoconsuming and
labor-intensive."

That ﬁrst group was taught to ﬁnd

 




them and we don’t know where they
came from.”

With the 200’s massive rebuild-
ing, retirement seemed the only hu-
mane solution. ‘

“We switched from the old way.’
of exhibiting animals taxonomically,
which meant that all big cats went,
in the feline house, to exhibiting
them zoogeographically [as they are
distributed in nature],” spokesman
Erika Archibald explained.

Outside of Tarzan movies, Afri-
can lions and Asian tigers don’t live
together in the wild, she said. “So
we don’t display them together any-
more.”

Modern zoos are committed to
contributing to world conservation
programs, which means reproduc-
ing pedigreed animals._Breeding
registered Sumatran, Bengal or Si-
berian tigers is a priority, Mr. Wag-
ner said, because they are endan-
gered species.

Zoo Atlanta’s master plans call
for a Sumatran tiger exhibit to be
completed by 1990, and stocked
with a young breeding pair of the
extremely rare tigers.

An African lion exhibit, in the
200’s East African Savanna, will be
home to one male and two female
lions when it is completed next
year. At that time, Dr. Maple said,
Valentino could go on exhibit there
on a rotating basis.

The big cats’ current existence
is a bittersweet one. The animals
are still beautiful, and except for
Chandar the leopard, who suffers
from kidney disease, still fairly
healthy.

They live out of view in the
200’s old cat house, in small cages
that are open to an outdoor exer-
cise area they take turns using. The
cats don’t need much room because
some are getting arthritic, Mr. Wins-
low said. Valentino the lion some-
times sleeps as much as 22 hours a

ay.

“It’s quiet here,” he said, point- .
ing to the cat, house’s relative isola-
tion. “They can get out in the sun—
shine. And they like it when there’s
a light rain and they can get out and
roll in it.”

Making sure that the big cats’
last years are healthy is sometimes
difficult, he said, because wild ani-
mals instinctively tend to mask inju-
ries that might make them suscepti-
ble to predators. ,

“We spend a lot of time on pre-
ventive medicine with the cats,” zoo
; veterinarian Rita McManamon said. .
’ Specialists are brought in when
necessary. “We had an ophthalmol-
ogist examine Valentino because we
were considering cataract surgery,”
Dr. McManamon said, “but then we
learned he was blind'in that one

Although the life expectancy of
a big cat in captivity — 20 to 25
years -— is much longer than one in
the wild, the quality of that life is
questionable, Mr. Winslow said.
“They get really geriatric and go
into a state of decline. I guess that's
what happens when you take care
of them. These wild animals were
never meant to grow old.”

split Antelope Embryo ‘ '
ipYieldsOne Birth -

The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical

T ' Gardens claims the first successful birth

' of an exotic zoo animal from a split
. embryo transplant. The procedure,
_ which has been performed on domestic

animals, may serve as a useful method

for preserving animal populations, says
Betsy Dresser, director of research for
the 200’s Center for Reproduction of

Endangered Wildlife.

The birth of Ditto, an eland that -

weighed a healthy 70 pounds, . was
achieved after scientists ﬁrst split an
embryo about as small as the head of a
pin from a donor eland and transferred
the halves to two surrogate mothers.
One of the embryo segments did not
develop after implantation, but 200 of—
ﬁcials remain optimistic that the tech-
nique can produce twins in future at—
tem ts. ,

lgesearchers hope to perfect the
technique on the eland for use With the
rare bongo, another type of African
antelope, which is hunted extenSively
for its horns.

Dresser says she and her colleagues
are already trying the split embryo pro-
cedure on big cats such as tigers and

smaller, much rareriexotic cats. "Bans—
planting a split embryo that has been
frozen will also be attempted.

They’ve had their day in the spot-
light and now, in the autumn of their
lives, Zoo Atlanta’s big cats have been
put out to pasture.

The zoo’s entire feline collection
— two 13-year-old tigers, a 14-year-old
lion, a 14—yeai-old jaguar and an ailing
16-year-old leopard —— is officially in re-
tirement, lolling away the hours out of
the public eye. The only big cat on dis-
play is, in fact, a little one: Kashmir, 3
four-month-old Bengal tiger cub on loan
until December from the Columbus,
Ohio, 200.

Off display and out of the breeding

business because of their advanced age.

Zoos all over the country are be—

, ing caught in a bind these days. Ad-
vances in veterinary science and
zoo management have resulted in-
what Bob Wagner, director of the
National Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums, politely calls

- “an overpopulation of aged ani-
mals.”

At the same time, many zoos are
moving away from having two of ev-
ery kind of animal crowded togeth-
er. Most are trying to specialize by
breeding and displaying only the
rarest or most endangered animals
in naturalistic settings.

SO what happens to surplus ani-
mals like Atlanta’s Valentino, an el-
derly half-blind lion with a touch of

At the National Zoo in Washing-

man Mike Mor-
gan said.
Many zoos

When the Detroit Zoo an-

Siberian tigers, a huge public out-
cry and lawsuit ensued. The 200
won the suit and three tigers 'were
destroyed. Four more were killed in
1985

But in Atlanta, euthanasia isn’t
used as a management technique,
Dr. Maple said. And trading the big
cats to another zoo is not an option
because of their age, health and
lack of pedigree.

All of Zoo Atlanta’s cats “are es- .

1, Some of the country's national

a: depl‘~ra.hi<= state that they are
Killing the : eatures they were de-
sggned é<2 re, according to a re-
port reieasea‘ last week by a na—
tional conservation group on the
a) most endangered refuges.

2 At the ,iiesterson National
Wildlife Rei-age in California, the
Wilderness Society report notes,
the staff rises around with shot-
guns and .,:xplosive devices to
spare ducks and other wildlife
away from ponds that have been
phisoned by runoff from agricul—
tiii’ral fields. The offspring of birds
that have tried to nest in these
ponds have been severely de—
formed.

“This one of the major scan—
dals of American conservation,”
said the group's president. George
aﬁr-"ampton Jr., noting that. the
[might of the 445 national wildlife
refuges is far worse than that of
the better-known national parks.
These reserves, which cover 90

rfi'illion acres, 77 million of them.

in Alaska. are supervised by the
US Fish and Wildlife Service.

National wildlife refuge is

“really a misnomer." said Frampa

ton, because the wildlife does not
take priority and the areas are
.open to development. ”These

’ ;....

plaCes are not safe havens or
sanctuaries for wildlife."

Although the refuges have
been "ignored for decades,”
Frampton said. the Reagan ad-
ministration has made things
worse by its efforts to increase

commercial development on ref-‘
uges. One of the administration’s-

major priorities, he said. has been
to turn the Arctic National Wild-

life Refuge on Alaska’s north slope

into an oil field.

The Wilderness Society report
recommends a number of mea-
sures to improve the refuges, in-
cluding a new congressional act
that gives the Fish and Wildlife
Service a clear mandate to protect
wildlife and their habitats.

William Refl'alt, who wrote the
report, noted that the country
spends more money on its eight
military bandsthan on the 445
refuges.

Fish and Wildlife Service direc-
tor Frank Dunkle released a state
ment declaring that the problems
detailed the report “are not new
nor are they being ignored. The so-
ciety seems to think we can build
a moat arund each of our 445 ref-

uges to protect them from pollu?

tion and other external threats.
Unfortunately, that just is not
possible."

The reports cites a variety of
other threats to refuges including:

a danger to animals

0 Toxic runoff from agricultur- 2

al fields and mines.

0 Water projects that divert
water from refuge marshlands. .

OOff—road vehicle traffic that
disturbs the wildlife.

OEar-shattering, low-altitude

military.

Great Meadows National Wild-
life Refuge along the Concord and
Sudbury rivers in eastern Mass—
achusetts was under consider—
ation for the worst 10 list, but it

'was excluded in the final cut be-

cause its contamination prob-
lems, which‘stem from an old in-

(Florida). Great Swamp (New Jer—

sey) and Lower Rio Grande (Tex—,

as).

The report's author, William
Reffalt of the Wilderness Society,
said that government could take a
number of steps to better protect
the refuges, including buying
more land to provide buffer zones
and using powers already avail—
able under the Clean Water Act to
crack down on sources polluting
waters flowing into the refuges.

HOUSTON POSTJ - October 29, 1988

. j The plight of the two gray ‘
-.whales trapped in the ice

. near Point Barrow, the north—
:je‘rmost tip of Alaska, drew.
. international concern and

sparked an extraordinary res—
icue effort that lasted for days

 

‘as marine scientists slowly

 

chopped a path through the
imprisoning ice to the open '
sea. Even the Russians, infamous
for their savagery toward the
world’s cetaceans, joined the effort
with an ice-breaking ship.

I suspect the cynics and skeptics
will have a field day with this affair.

We might expect them to ask, and “

justifiably so, why spend a huge
sum of money to save two ani-
mals? Why not let nature take its
course, and if it’s unpleasant, well,
that’s life in the wild.

Such sentiments are understand-
able, but they miss the larger mes-
sage, the underlying, resonant
point. The human race is the stew-

ard of the Earth, and by and large ‘

we have failed miserably in our
stewardship. ‘

Such moments in. our lives, as
the rescue of the trapped whales,
sharpen our sense of duty toward
the world’s wildlife. Such events

are a cry from the wilderness that -

the living earth must look to man-
kind for its ultimate salvation.

Someone once told me that he
didn’t see any reason for wildlife
rehabilitation groups saving injured
animals like raccoons and mock—
ingbirds and other common spe—
cies. There are lots of them around,
so why bother? -I pointed out that
programs for nursing urban wildlife
back to health are beneficial not
just for the animals, but for us, and
especially for young people, to
heighten our sense of purpose and

responsibility toward all wildlife.

Not that the whale rescue was
without itspractical side. Two
whales were saved, and that ., was
no small task. The whales were

'trapped behind a mile or so of ice, '

with only a small hole fer breath-
ing.

They had to get to the open sea
for feeding and to. set out on their
migration south, which begins
each year in October.

Gray whales feed on the bottom
of shallow coastal waters, where
they root around in the mud and
mol-
luscs and worms. Since they must
come up for air every several min-
utes, they must not be restricted in
their movements.

The trapped whales could
breathe through the small hole that
was available to them, but they
could not roam widely to feed be-
cause of the ice cover. Failure to be
freed from the ice would have
meant exhaustion and starvation.

From May to October the gray
whales roam the cold shallow seas
of the far north, the Beaufort Sea,
off northeastern Alaska, and the
Chukchi Sea, off Siberia.

In October the whales gather
and move down the eastern edge
of the Bering Sea, through the Uni—
mak Pass of the Aleutian Islands,
and down along the west coast of

- ona whale rescue a

the United States to the bays and '

lagoons of Baja California. Of all
the whales, the gray whales live
closer to land than any other spe-
cres.

The females will give birth in
those quiet, protected waters of
Baja. In May the whales head north
again to their summer seas of the
high latitudes. -

The two whales of Point Barrow
(there were three, but one presum4
ably died) apparently were making
their way southward, but got
trapped in the vast maze of thick—

' ening ice.

These whales have basically
served as a dramatic reminder to us
that, even while nature does take
its toll in the normal rhythms of life
and death, man can and must play
a role in the preservation of the
living world.

The whales certainly benefited
from this heroic and cdurageous ef—
fort, but in a deeper sense all of us,
rescuers and distant observers
alike, benefited as well. We had the
chance to give something» to na—
ture, instead of taking from it, and
in doing so we enriched ourselves.

So now the whales are headed
for Bahia Magdalena, and the res-
cuers will be justly praised for their
noble and arduous efforts. We all
feel pride and admiration for them,
but I feel something in addition:
envy.

I envy them that sense of jubila-
tion, that transforming exhilaration
that they surely must have felt
when those two great craggy-
skinned beasts, after days of labor
and doubt, broke free from the ice
and headed out to sea for their long
and ancient journey south.

It was a triumph for the whales
and their rescuers, and a triumph
for those of us who watched their
struggles and cared about them.

Doyle Shugart: Burial space for nearly a quarter of a million animals.

Commumrv

Perpetual Pet Care in GMnnett

_ winnett may be great (if
you believe everything
: you read on water
- ”as towers), but it’s now a
gate to the great beyond for
many north Atlanta pets.
Entering a new realm of
suburban sophistication, the
county will be the eventual
resting place of some 240,000
dogs, cats and other assorted
household pets, thanks to
Doyle Shugart and his new pet
cemetery.

“I have always been
interested in pets,” Shugart
says, his fatherly drawl
conveying more concern than
his tender words. “In fact,
when I was 10 years old, if
there was a death of a pet in
the community, I would take
the pet, bathe it in alcohol, set
its features, and I would use a

shoe box or a pasteboard box
lined with cotton, and we
would have a burial with a
little service. Pets have always
been that close to me.”

Given his undying devotion
to animals, it came as no
surprise that the Gwinnett
County Commission granted
Shugart permission to establish
the IO-acre Deceased Pet Care
Memorial Gardens near
Lawrenceville. A professional
embalmer and funeral home
director, Shugart opened the
cemetery in late summer as a
natural offshoot of his pet
cremation, casket and um
business; it is the first such
facility north of Atlanta. (The
city is currently served by two
other pet cemeteries — Loving
Care in Douglasville and Pet
Heaven Memorial Park in

Fulton County.)

For many pet owners, losing
a pet is as serious as losing a
close relative. Consequently
Shugart offers services that are
commensurate with people’s
grief. “We’re going to put a
funeral chapel for pets in next
door [at his DeKalb County
cremation facility], and we’re
going to'have a little chapel
and a visitation area there for
people to come and have a
meditation time with their pet
before it goes to the cemetery
to be buried,” Shugart says.
And if pet owners still can’t
get over the loss, Shugart refers
them to — this is still very
serious -—- a grief therapist.
“She specializes in pet
bereavement counseling.”

. an wants happy endin s, but nature
doesn’t care. Man pe ects technology;
nature perfects plants and animals.
Thus, two current conservation stories featuring
wolves and whales, two icons of the environ-
mental movement, raise serious questions about
man’s efforts to try to save nature in spite of
itself.

Last week’s superpower whale rescue effort off
the Alaskan coast has received worldwide atten-
tion, and man may yet thwart the ways of na—
ture there. But on Isle Royale in Lake Superior,
where a world—famous wolf pack is dwindling
toward extinction, nature may be having the
ﬁnal word.

 
  

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - October 30, 1988

I Sometimes it can be nice to fool Mother Nature

have dared to hope for the agonizing humanitar-
ian effort displayed in Barrow, Alaska, over the
last few weeks, with its overtones both of hero-
ism and slapstick comedy. The stranded Califor-
nia gray whales struck a nerve, perhaps because
of all the harm mankind has inflicted on whales
over the centuries.

The rescue effort, which may well end up
costing more than $1 million, brought together
normally hostile opposites—the US. and Soviet
governments, guitar—strumming Greenpeace ac-
tivists and North Slope oil companies, animal
behaviorists and whale killers. _

The lnupiat Eskimos were amazing, braving
disaster as they tirelessly kept sawing holes in

the ice to keep the trapped whales alive. Yet the

residents of Barrow, the world’s largest Eskimo

we do not kill for sport,” reporters were told by
acting Mayor Warren Matumeak. “These whales
are suffering and need our help.”

The bruised and bleeding animals obligingly
bobbed up on TV each night, “striking a har-
poon into the hearts of Americans,” as one re-
porter noted. But veterinarians watching the
same ﬁlm saw only something they must con-
front in their offices every day———the telltale be—
havior of bewildered, disoriented animals in ter-
rible, even mortal, distress.

Ofﬁcials at the National Marine Fisheries Ser—
vice tallied hundreds of telegrams and phone
calls from around the world.

“We were hearing: ‘Do everything you can to
save those whales,’ ’ said John Sease of the serv-
ice’s ofﬁce in Juneau, Alaska. “If there’s grum—

“That was crazy. Gray whales are
. polar '
bears,” complained Ian . trrling, a
Canadian Wildlife Service biologist
regarded as Canada’s leading polar
bear expert.

“Why sacriﬁce one endangered
species for another ” demanded
Stirling, who noted that “the
Alaskan Eskimos are partial to
whales, but in the Canadian
Beaufort Sea, polar bears are the
most important species to the

. Eskimos.”

humans have no right to utilize other spe-
cies.

”The animal—rights philosophy is abo-
iittonist rather than reformist," says Tom

Regan, a North Carolina State Uniwr‘s‘ity "

philosopher influential in the {foid ”It'c.

not bigger cages we want, but empty
cages.”
Critics, however. dismiss such a pro-
gression as “egalitarianism gone ber-
serk,” in the words of Dr. Joseph Spinelli
of the University of California at San
Francisco. They note that an increasingly
urbanized and technocratic culture has
helped fuel the movement with large
stocks of nostalgic sentimentalism. a pro-
position even apologists do not dispute.
“Animal rights comes at a time of dra-
matic, massive failure of the whole ra-
tional—mechanistic-industrial structure
embodied by the Challenger disaster," ob-
serves Bernie Rollin, an animal-rights
philosopher at Colorado State University.
“It‘s a tremendous outpouring of nature-
passion when, for the first time, most peo-
ple have no interaction with nature.”
Such passion finds Congress receiving
more mail on. the siihgect of animal re~
search than on any other topic. according
to Dr. Charles McCarthy, head of the Of-
fice for Protection from Research Risks at
the National Institutes of Health. He says
the mail runs ltBO-to-l against the use of
animals. Beyongi that, such sentiment
has already landed at least five different

animal-welfare referendums on state and
county ballots around the country, each
of which proposed to - ban the use of
pound animals in research.

Of the 20 million Americans who ex-
press “profound interest" in the affairs of
animals, perhaps 2 million belong to radi-
cal “rights” groups such as People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Ani-
mal Rights Front of New Haven and the
international Society for Animal Rights.
Of these more extreme groups, some cam-
paign for ‘g‘animal rights”: some for "ani-
mal liberation"; some against the “op—
pression” of any species. “Even painless
research is fascism,” a spokesman for
one of these groups was recently quoted
as saying.

‘ In terms of specific accomplishment.
the movement has effected significant le—
gitimate change. As long ago as 1966.
animal activists helped lobby for the
successive revisions of the Animal Wel-
fare Act. which regulates the treatment of
a wider array of pets. zoo creatures and
lab stock, with stipulations mandating .
larger cages, the use of painskilling drugs
in surgical procedure, even specifications
on temperature. Out of such advocacy

i

have come major repercussions to whole
industries reliant on animal research:
cosmetics, pharmaceutical development,
chemical testing and medical study. Con-
sequently, the numbers of animals used.
in research have declined dramatically:

from 33.8 million in 1968. according to.

the National Acadeiny of Sciences, to per-
haps 20 million now, according to the

Congressional Office of Technology As-
sessment. ‘

Cases of fanaticism

“Though the extremist rights people
have hindered science, an awful lot of the
points made by the animal—welfare peOple
have been very beneficial in suggesting
reductions or alternatives,” says Shayne
Gad, a scientist at CD. Searle & Co. and
chairman of the Society of Toxicology‘s
Animals-in-Research Committee.

And yet, as Gad emphasizes, animal-
rights activism has in some cases become
fanaticism. Bombs have been exploded,
laboratories torched and animals “liber- 7
ated” after nighttime break-ins. Last Feb-

ruary, 13 beagles were stolen from a Calif .

fornia laboratory by a group called the"
Animal Liberation Front; there I... . - been _j

a series of bomb threats at the Yerkes
Center, and a farm-animal diagnostic
laboratory under construction at the Uni-
versity of California at Davis has been
torched. Such actions have raised re-
criminations among even sympathizers,
and confused matters by injecting law-
lessness. More than anything, such ﬁle
gitimate “direct action” has contributed
to the perception that perhaps the move—
ment has gone too far.

Yet fanaticism alone seems a red-her—
ring next to less benign practicaleffects
the movement has had. Chiefly in the
area of medical inquiry. In this connec-'
tion, critics angrily mock an ideology that
appears ready to sacrifice human benefit
for animal well-being. “As. far as life-sav—
ing medical research, animal rights

; means a slow suffocation of science."

warns Franky Trull, whose Foundation
for Biomedical Research defends the use
of animals in research; She says the new
federal rules, mandated by the 1986 addi—
tions to the Animal Welfare Act but not
yet implemented, will cost $1 billion for
the installation of exercise runs. larger
cages. At the Yerkes Center. meanwhile,
Dr. King says six attempted break-ins
during the last few years have required
the expenditure of "between $200,000
and $300,000” in new security equip-
ment. Even worse, King complains. such
tactics have “scared some people from do-
ing medical research.”

“At the level of graduate students. it’s
having an inhibitive, discouraging ef—
fect.” King maintains. “I really see this is
as dangerous attack mounted by people
ethically ignorant of the fundamental re-
search activity of Western civilization.”

Regarding Question 3 on the Mass-
achusetts ballot, finally, similar com-7
plaints turn up. Sponsors of the farm ani—
mals referendum —— which raised some
120,000 signatures during recent months

- claim their oal is to en-
sure "the redu tion of suf-
fering in all beings, human
and animal," as Evelyn
Kimber of the Citizens for
Humane Farming, has it.

And yet, Agriculture Com-
missioner Schumacher finds
it "morally offensive” that
"while this state had

10,000 cases of child-abuse
last year, here's all this
concern about animals when

I have had ndfone allegation
of animal abuse." Besides

HOUSTON POST - October 29, 1988

Pranskters soars as black cats on holiday
as kitnappers descend on neighborhoods

By Rob Meckel'
OF THE HOUSTON POST STAFF

 

Black cats left to prowl Hous-
ton’s streets on mystical Allhal-
low’s Eve can become only haunt-
ing memories for owners who
don’t protect them from kitnap-
pers, animal protection officals
warn.

“Black cats seem to disappear
over the Halloween period and not
come back” when they cross paths
with the wrong person, said James
Bias, shelter coordination director
of Citizens for Animal Protection.

All cats, not just black cats,
should be kept indoors during the
Halloween season to keep them
from being abused by pranksters,
occult groups and people who want
to use them as Halloween props,
Bias said.

Bias noted the shelter suspends
black cat adoptions during the sea-
son to protect them from abuse.

Some people are fascinated with _

black cats this time of year because
legends and ghost stories associate
the felines as companions for
witches and other things tied to the
supernatural, humane officials said.

Joe LaPalomento, executive as-
sistant for the Houston-Fort Bend
Society for the Prevention of Cruel-
ty to Animals, said some children
deal with their superstitious fears
about black cats by subjecting
them to cruelty -— throwing rocks
at them and hitting them with
sticks.

The cats also suffer at the hands
of thoughtless people who pick
them up as gag gifts or to use as
props for their Halloween cos-
tumes or parties, LaPalomento
said. Afterward, the cats often ar
dumped. '

And some black cats have been
used in animal sacrifices, Bias said.

Bias said cruelty to animals in
Texas is a Class A misdemeanor
punishable by as long as a year in
jail and a $2,000 fine.

TAMPA TRIBUNE
November 1. 1099

Pet Shops Don't
Like Puppy Mills

The Oct. 9 Tribune carried the col-
umn “Ask Your Vet” by Ann Huntington.
While there are a few facts in the article,
it was generally misleading and highly
insulting to thousands of very caring peo-
ple who work in the retail pet industry. It

, was obviously written for the sensational-

ism it provided in an effort to fill 15 col-

' umn inches.

There is no question that puppy mills

exist; there are stupid and greedy people
, in every business and in government.
However, Huntington’s condemnation of
the entire pet industry was as unreason-
able as it was unfounded. The manner in
6 which she did it qualifies her for writing
in the more lurid tabloids rather than a
. highly respected paper such as the Tri-_

bune.

I don’t know the author’s qualifica-
tions, if any, to write about dogs, but she
displayed a lack of knowledge about
them and even greater ignorance about

journalism. The few facts she does use,
; she distorts; and I find it hard to believe

that any editor even glanced at this

piece. I can’t understand why you would

.- ,....,w<.n ”an" x u» _.

" ""‘5 “" 'n‘w—rwa-va-owon-Ma‘uD-vvawa =Mv-w

knowingly print this unsupported attack
and unpaid ad for her clinic.

I’ve worked for a pet shop in Tampa,
one of more than 150 franchised by a
national company. Contrary to Hunting-
ton’s inferences, most pet shops will not
deal with puppy mills.

The pet shop I’ve worked for guaran-
tees the health of its animals for six
months, which no breeder will do. Pup-
pies are taken out to be played with at

every opportunity and are probably re—

ceiving the best care they will ever get in
their lives. With their health monitored
daily, these puppies are probably in bet-
ter condition than any you can buy from
a breeder. They are older and any prob-
lems have had an opportunity to be dis-
covered.

Huntington displays a shocking lack

‘ of knowledge for a person who is appar-

- -. ..__.W- warm—saw. “9' -' . . . ~'—’~‘

ently charging people for helping their
dogs. She apparently doesn’t understand
that dogs are den animals and, in the
wild, will dig a hole; a cage is not the
same for a dog as for a human.
Breeders keep puppies in cages, just
as we keep babies in cribs. On an air-
plane or truck trip, puppies sleep most of

' the time. Her advice on training assumes

you can stay with the pup constantly for

y the first week, a very unrealistic idea.

.Her claim that pet stores make a
huge profit is unfounded since they are
among the most frequent bankruptcy vic-
tims. She offers no evidence or facts for

any of her claims. Not even a hint as to
fwhere one could get such evidence —'

because her claims are unfounded.

in We _

t sounds like a Swedish fairy

tale for animals—and in a
way it really is. Last sum-
mer the Swedish government
agreed to extend its already
generous welfare state to
include barnyard animals.
Cows, pigs and even chickens
now enjoy the protection of
their own bill of rights. Under
a series of regulations now go-
ing into effect, animals are
not to be pumped full of anti-
biotics and hormones just to
fatten them up for market.
Chickens must not be cooped
up indeﬁnitely. Cows and pigs
must have access to straw and
litter. And all animals, the
law states, "must be protected
from unnecessary suffering
when slaughtered.”

A leading force behind all of
this was Astrid Lindgren, 81,
Sweden’s world-renowned au-
thor of children’s books. Sev-
eral years ago Lindgren—who
is perhaps best known as the
creator of "Pippi Longstock-

 

ing,” an adventurous young
girl who does what she pleas-
es—launched a campaign to
make the treatment of farm
animals a national issue. She
published a series of satiri-
cal allegories—often grown-
up versions of children’s tales
—dramatizing barnyard cru-
elty. The stories added fuel to
an animal-welfare movement
already under way. Farmers’
groups and some major food
companies objected to Lind-
gren’s stories—but in vain.
When the animal-rights legis-

passed with little opposition.

The new regulations assure

an existence as possible.
Cows, the law says, must be
allowed to graze. Pigs "must
no longer be tethered; they
must have separate spaces for
feeding, bedding and void-
ing.” Animal interests are al-
ways to be taken into account.
"New technology,” the law
states, “must be tested from
an animal-protectiv- vicw
point before [being] used.”

Not everyone in Sweden
has found the barnyard bill
of rights a cause for celebra-
tion. Food-processing compa-
nies objected that the law
would increase their costs.
Many Swedish farmers re-
sented the legislation be-
cause they felt it unfairly
portrayed them as uncaring
and. abusive of their live-
stock. Some wondered how
the law could possibly be
enforced. Asked Sven Erik
Jansson, spokesman for the
Federation of Swedish Farm-
ers: “Just exactly how can
you tell whether a pig is hap—
py?” If he’s in Sweden, you
can guess he probably is.

Under threat: Amerlcan sea chefs are tightlng man’s attempts to resettle them on San Nicolas Island.

SEA OTTERS, those engag-
ing whiskered mammals that
so entrance visitors to Amer-
ica’s Big Sur coast, are caus-
ing headaches.

An attempt to create a new
sea otter colony, so that a single
environmental disaster, like an
oil spill, will not destroy Califor-
nia’s last surviving group, has
run into problems.

Apart from enraging local
ﬁshermen who say sea otters kill
their shellﬁsh, the animals have
shown startling disdain for scien-
tists’ efi‘orts. ‘They have upped
and gone,’ said one biologist.

This year, govezrunent and
State conservationists moved 63
sea otters from Calitnrnia’s Mon-
terey area to San Hzcolas island,
50 miles off Los Argeles.

Unfortunately, w thin weeks,
only a few otters remained.
Some disappeared or were
washed up, deari However,

many older mammals swam 250
miles back to Monterey.

‘We were staggered they
could tackle a journey like that,’
said Jack Arms, of the California
department of ﬁsh and game. ‘It
is an extraordinary feat of navi-
gation and swimming power.’

Undaunted, scientists have
ca tured more otters and
re eased then on San Nicolas,
this time using only young ani-
mals who l' ave less powerful
homing instincts and swimming
prowess. Results are now anx-
iously awaited. .

These problems—n if nothing
else ~— demos zstrate how difﬁcult
re-introductiwn programmes for
endangered 5 weeks can be.

A more extreme example is

attempt to create a colony of
whooping cranes at Gray’s Lake,
Idaho. Several years later, no
cranes have produced offspring.

According to the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, less than half of
their recintroductions actually
succeed. The sea otter recovery
plan should therefore be seen in
this context.

in fact, sea otters, the world’s

smallest marine mammals, now
have a great deal going for

them—~in particular their cud-

dly teddy bear; looks which have

yers

made them California’s most
popular wild animals.

Their luxurious pelts of line
fur-— which trap air and keep
their bodies at lOOF in 50F
water— led to them being
hunted to the verge of extinction
earlier this century. With num-
bers at about 1,500, the popula-
tion is only now recovering.

Today, fur has become their
saviour. Friends of the Otters
has 4,500 members and has puh~
lished posters showing otters
clasping their paws together as if
in prayer (which they do to keep
their sensitive skin pads dry).
Against this propaganda, local
ﬁshermen, the otters’ main er e-
mies (apart from hungry white
sharks) can only curse in futile

fury.

Their supporters, Save our
Shellﬁsh, say the creation of new
colonies and protection zones has
led to devastation of their beds
of clam and abalone —— the sea
otter’s main food source.

That, say conservationists, is
the price of saving a f’hrr;:?_ened
species. ‘When it comes to a
burly ﬁshermen or .i czéddly,
furry sea otter in pave; . the
latter —-not surpriiin gly -- gets
all the support} said Mmianne
Riedrran, a Moateray Aquarium
biologist.

She and colleagues are study-
ing sea otters in an attempt to
teach young an mals -~ regularly
orphaned around Monterey -- to
fend for themselves. ‘Mother
otters teach their young how to
catch and eat siiellﬁsh,’ said Ms
Reidmann. ‘If we want to save
otters, we have to teach them
inste: d. Given that they are such
strong, playful creatures, ‘hat is z
proving to be very (iéif’ic.ult.’

 

 

 

 




rairie dogs worry Texas town

Many fear rodents could carry ancient, deadly disease

By Paul Weingarten
Chicago Tribune

ODESSA, Tex—From his front
porch, David Lacroix maintains a
close surveillance on the inexora—
ble advance of the enemy—a
chubby, gopher-like west Texas
native known as the prairie dog.

He hears its chirpy bark drifting

from Sherwood Park across the
street. He watches new craters
materialize almost daily, closer
and closer to his home.

Lacroix and many others in
Odessa worry that the animals,
which are actually rodents, could
unleash a new outbreak of a dis-
ease that many mistakenly believe
was extinguished in the Middle
Ages: bubonic plague.

“Sure I’m concerned,” says
Lacroix, 34, an oil field mainte-
nance worker who has lived in
Odessa with his wife and two chil—

dren for eight years. “.They’re-

rodents, and they’re running ram-
pant”

While many other animals—no-
tably skunks, rabbits and rats—
can carry the plague bacteria,
prairie dogs are particularly sus-
ceptible to the disease. It can be
transmitted to humans via direct
contact with infectedrodents or
by ﬂeas that have bitten diseased
rodents.

Earlier this year, health officials
discovered an entire colony of
prairie dogs and hundreds of rats
killed by the disease about 20
miles from Odessa.

“It can wipe out a prairie dog
colony like Sherwood Park in less
than a week,” says Dr. Evret
Newman, a veterinarian for the
Texas Department of Health who
is responsible for 37 counties and
62,000 square miles in west
Texas. “And then we’re gonna
have a whole bunch'of hungry
ﬂeas right there in town, which I
don’t think we need.”

In truth, the 700 or so prairie
dogs in Sherwood Park show no
signs of illness at the moment.
They are so healthy, in fact, that
they have laid waste to the park,
the city’s second largest, riddling
it with foot-wide burrow holes
and rendering two soccer fields
and two softball diamonds almost
useless.

Prairie dogs are generally not
aggressive, but in recent months
the animals reportedly have bitten
two local children. In one case, a
boy accidentally tangled with a
prairie dog when he attempted to
retrieve a softball that had rolled
into its burrow.

 

 

 

 

 

 

Earlier this month, a prairie dog
was caught in the hallway of an
elementary school across from the
park. .

Any day now, LacrOix expects
to find a burrow in his front lawn.
In that event, he has threatened
to take. matters—and rifle—into
his own hands. - _

“It’s deadly serious,” says City
Parks Director Joe Carithers, who
is preparing a repo t that Will rec—

the rapidly encroaching Sherwood
Park prairie dogs. “The plague
could blow up in our face tomor-
r0“].”

Such is the level of frustration
mounting in this beleaguered oil
town, which was recently ranked
by Psychology Today magazine as
America’s seventh most stressful
city. First the oil bust pummeled
the local economy, and now the
prairie dogs have laid siege.

In the last 12 years, four cases
of plague have been reported in
west Texas. Two people have

died, even though there is a cure i
if the disease is diagnosed early ':

enough. One of those deaths oc-
cured in Odessa SIX years ago.

town, some of the city’s destitute

The opher-like prairie dogs are considered fairly intelligent and are
proli lC breeders. They are difficult to trap because of a barking
warning signal used to alert others to danger.

“The plague is not dead, not by

' a long shot,” says Newman.

Bubonic plague, which medieval
Europeans called the Black
Death, annihilated 25 million
people—or a quarter of the con-
tinent’s pepulation—in the _l4th
Century. The first known U.S.
cases occurred in San Francisco
at the turn of the century.

The disease, Which has crept

slowly eastward since then, has

never reached epidemic propor-
tions in this country. But 838
cases have been reported over the

years, with 393 fatalities, most of

them before antibiotics were dis-

' covered.

More than half of all plague
cases reported today occur in
New Mexico, spread by the cot-
ton and wood rats, rock squirrels
and prairie dogs that are so plen-

tiful in the state’s northern pinon
forests. .7 - -. '-

Cases of the plaguehave
identified as far east as Big

Spring, Tex., about 80 miles east -

of Odessa. State health officials
and federal epidemiologists are
tracking the advance of the dis-
ease, but most experts do not ex-
pect it to move beyond central
Texas—mainly because the
rodents that most readily catch

and transmit the disease are ab- ‘

sent farther east.

Odessa’s plan to poison its prai-
rie dogs was derailed last year by
the West Texas Humane Society,
which rallied public support
against it.

“It’s slow and cruel, and we just
don’t go for it,” says Don
Hallmark, the society’s president.

Gary Guyot, a psychology professor
at Regis College who has studied cat
play. Through interactions with sib-
1111511 111113 mothers during play, kittens
learn how to live in the world. “It is
during play that kittens learn to con—
trol how hard they can bite and to
retract their claws when interacting
with others,” Guyot says. “Kittens
raised in isolation tend to be aggres-
aivc and hyperactive. They often
mature into cats with behavior prob-
lems. Male kittens raised in isolation
are unable to mate and have poor
grooming habits as adults.”

An only kitten is hard to wean, and
it cries often. It cannot cope with
separation from its mother or its sur-
rogate mother—its owner. “This is

the type of cat that displays anxiety.

separation from its owner,”
Guyot notes.

Moreover, kittens raised

more suspicious and cautious than
those kittens weaned at the usual time
of six to eight weeks.

Feline social graces are taught by
interactions not only with mother and
siblings, but also with people. Han-
dling kittens daily when they are three
to seven weeks of age leads them to
become friendly and loving to people.

Encourage your kitten to engage in
such behaviors as stalking, chasing,
and pouncing, which teach kittens
basic survival skills. When you drag a
string or toss a ball for your kitten to
chase, you are actually helping the
kitten improve its motor skills
by learning to adapt its speed
to that of the moving object.

In this way, it can monitor
and change its pace as
needed during a chase.

a powerful stimulus.

Anything can become a toy. My
cat, C.K., loves a paper sack. He ap-
pears to be playing hide-and-seek
with himself. One of my clients en-
tices her cat out from under the bed
with a string when I come to give
vaccinations. (I operate a house-call
veterinary service for cats.) The lure
of the string is greater than the cat’s
fear of me.

Midnight, a cat belonging to my
friend Judy, likes to find small ob-
jects and hide them in Judy’s shoes.
Judy says: “He casually drops the
crumpled paper or spool in one of my '
shoes. Then, he sidles by and acts sur-
prised to find the object in the shoe.
He retrieves the object and presents it
to me. I always make a big deal over
it by saying something like, ‘Wow,
where did you ‘get this, Midnight?’ He
looks very pleased with himself.”

Lavern, another client, has taught
her cat, Bubba, to ring a small bell
at the bottom of the back door
frame when he wants to go outside.
Lavern admits that she rang the bell,
opened the door, and crawled out the
first few times so that Bubba would

get the idea. When Bubba acci-

dentally hit the bell the first

(1 time, Lavern opened the

‘ door and pushed him

ut. Now, when Bubba

scratches at the door to

go out, Lavern ignores

him; when he rings the

bell, she opens the door.

Lavern claims that she is

playing with her cat;

that Bubba has trained

Cauthon was at Wyn—

tember when she discovered the all-black
dog she named Rosemary.

“She was standing sort of stiff on all
fours looking down intently into the
grass,” she recalled. “I assumed that like
most strays she must be starving. Later, I
saw she was not hungry at all, but sick
and mangy. I quickly went to the super-
market across the street and bought some
wieners but she didn’t seem interested at
all. She just stood there staring at the

“I know I can’t save all the stray and

Cauthon said. “The vet said both would

The animal—welfare
organization established
in 1976 provides a tem-

and abandoned dogs and
cats until permanent
homes can be found for
them. Known as a “no-

homes for about 1,300 cats and dogs —— or
about 96 percent of the animals it accept-

Black cat presumed dead
found by Dallas resident

By Jeff South
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

Nearly three years after a black cat
named Winston strayed from his East
Dallas home and was presumed dead,
he has been returned to his tearful
owner — just in time for Halloween.

“It’s like he has been resurrected,”
Eleanor Kilgore said Monday. “This is
one cat that really has nine lives, I
guess.”

Kilgore received a call Sunday
afternoon from a North Dallas woman
who had noticed Winston’s worn
leather collar and metal identiﬁcation
tag and ﬁgured he was lost.

“I hopped in the car, with tears
streaming doWn my face,” Kilgore
said. . ‘

Winston emitted a meow of relief as
Kilgore picked him up for the first
time since Feb. 16, 1986.

“I think he was as surprised and
happy to see me as I was to see him,”
she said.

Kilgore, 55, doesn’t know how
Winston ended up 10 miles away or
how he survived his 32-month ordeal.
Winston looks no worse for wear, she
said. . .

He still weighs about 14 pounds and
has a shiny, bushy coat — though
now, with a few white hairs.

“He looks like a big black teddy
bear,” said Kilgore, a former model
who runs a horse stable and frequent—
ly opens her home near White Rock
Lake to neglected or abandoned pets.

She adopted Winston and four other
kittens when they were found in an
Oak Cliff parking lot in 1976.

She said Winston was “the perfect
cat, with a purr like a motorboat and a
ﬂamboyant personality.”

Winston didn’t just beg for dinner,
for example. “He’d sit on the dish—
washer and give you this big silent
meow, like a ﬁsh out of water. Then
he’d lie on the kitchen floor, with his
:- four feet sticking up in the air, and do

the story.

“It broke my heart,” she said.
“I Was absolutely devastated to
think that Winston had been
crushed by a car and thrown into
the garbage.”

When Sandy Odean and her
family moved to North Dallas in
July, they noticed a cat hanging
around their house.

Odean began leaving food out

for the skittish creature.

On Sunday, after months of
this routine, it allowed her to get
close enough to read its tag.

The cat was wearing a studded,
black-leather collar —— but most
of the shiny studs had fallen off.

The tag gave Kilgore’s name,
address and telephone number.

Odean called and asked, “Do
you own a big black cat with yel-
low eyes?”

The question took a few sec-
onds to register.

“Then I realized it couldn’t be

another couple of silent meows, like
he was dying of hunger.”

That’s why Kilgore felt such avloss
when Winston, who usually stayed in
the house, wandered off on a cold
Sunday evening in February 1986.

“It was the ﬁrst night he had spent
away from home,” she said.

Kilgore searched extensively for
Winston. She posted rewards, placed
newspaper ads, checked regularly
with animal shelters and asked resi-

dents if they had seen her cat.

About a week after Winston’s dis-
appearance, a city sanitation worker
offered a grim but plausible answer.
He told Kilgore that on Feb. 17, 1986,
he had picked up the carcass of a
black cat from the parking lot of a
nearby church.

Kilgore tracked down the church’s

term profits taken by individual
landowners,” John began the long
process of finding a buyer who
would keep the land wild as well as
maintained constant vigilance to
make sure the land was not tam-
pered with. Public support, which
has come and gone over the span of
four years, would be vital. ”You get
support, but many people just don’t
have the stamina to keep fighting,”
explains Roger.

In 1984 John organized the Envi-
ronmental Alliance for Central
Georgia, realizing it was going to
take more people and many, many
hours to deal with government
agencies and conservation groups.
They also enlisted the media’s help.

In four years, the group has an
impressive record: They success-
fully lobbied to have the Fall Line
Freeway rerouted around the
swamp, publicized Mercer’s plan to
divide and auction off the property,
and this year fought a referendum to
expand Macon’s airport because it
would have necessitated new roads
across the swamp.

John and two unnamed cohorts
take credit for a February 1987 epi-
sode when a perched eagle in full
view attracted the interest of hun-
dreds of spectators on Interstate 16.
After a day, the bird that sat awfully
still, and whose realism fooled a
newspaper photographer and TV
station personnel, was found to be a
fake. The placement of the spray-
foam insulation and paper-mache
bird was not a prank, according to
John, but rather an unusual way of
bringing the eagle to the attention of
the people.

”The eagle has always been the
focal point,” says Roger, who has
spent hundreds of hours photo-
graphing the real thing. ”But the
value of the wetlands is the larger
issue. They are a great benefit as a
natural resource, and it’s the best
use for the land. The land is the
poorest, economically, and the rich-
est, ecologically.”

John and Roger have spent the last
two years working on a video —- one
to three days a week, every week.
Neither have had training in video-
taping, so it’s been a learning experi-
ence. ”To get the right moment, with
the right quality, with the right light,
and without disturbing the eagles
has been challenging. Everything

that could go wrong has done so —
repeatedly,” Roger explains. The fin-
ished product is used for presenta-
tions and local news programs.

These efforts attracted attention,
but doors were closing at an alarm-
ing rate. The Nature Conservancy (a
group that buys land to protect it
and usually resells to the state or
federal government) did not have
the funds to purchase the land, nor
did the state Department of Natural
Resources. The possibility of finding
a private buyer who would donate
just the 3,000-acre wetlands seemed
slim, and Mercer could have come
up with a buyer/ developer at any
minute. As the Macon Telegraph put
it, a White Knight of the Wetlands
was needed to balance the goals of
Mercer and the Environmental Alli-
ance. Fortunately, it galloped up in
the form of the US. Fish and Wild-
life Service. ”The best solution we
could have hoped for has been
found,” John says.

The US. Department of Interior’s
Fish and Wildlife Service investi-
gates candidate lands for National
Wildlife Refuge status. The swamp
has already made it through a series
of ”cuts,” and now an environmen-
tal assessment study signals the final
phase. The report is scheduled for
release November 5, and the final
decision should be made around the

first of the year. The service is seek-
ing Georgia’s opinions, and you

Ronnie Shell, who helped inven-

purpose of the refuge would be to
preserve the wetlands, so every
other function would have to be
compatible with that main goal. The
public would have access to signed
trails during the day, and a big use
would be as an outdoor classroom
and laboratory. .

It appears that there would be no
losers if this plan goes through.
Clean water, ﬂood-controlled land,
and the protection of wildlife would
benefit all Georgians. The refuge
would also serve as a permanent re-
minder of how the involvement of a
handful of concerned citizens made

The clash over swamp land

This eagle family ’5 home — one of only eight eagle nesting sites in Georgia - has
been the focal point of a crusade to save 3,000 acres of wetlands south of Macon.

ll. But it could depend
on what Georgians have to say
about it.

At stake are 5,000 acres in Bibb and
Twiggs counties south of Macon,
where 3,000 acres of wetlands filter
pollutants out of the Ocmulgee
River and temporarily store water,
reducing downstream ﬂoods. The
swamp lies where the Coastal Plain
meets the Piedmont Region (the Fall
Line) and is home to deer, quail,
dove, duck, squirrels, rabbits, black
bears, bobcats, alligators, beavers,
fox, otters, egrets, herons, mallards,
wood ducks, black ducks and all
kinds of fish.

It’s a unique and useful place, and
Macon residents John Wilson and
Roger Idenden have spent four
years getting that story out in words
and pictures. Now that the federal

. government and its Wildlife Refuge

program have stepped in to consider
purchasing and protecting the land,
the clash between the landowner
(Mercer University) and conserva-
tionists may be over.

The battle began after John noticed
an eagle’s nest on the property adja-
cent to his backyard. (The eagle pop-
ulation in Georgia has gone from no
nests in 1980 to eight nests currently.
Eagles are considered an endan-
gered species; they mate for life and
generally occupy the same nest for
25 to 30 years.) “It’s like if there was a
car wreck in front of your house. It
was happening in my backyard, and
I had to do something about it,” John
says.

His goal was to preserve and pro-
tect the land, and Mercer, while not
opposed in theory to his efforts, set
out to make money off of the land.
The property, which has been ap-
praised for $12 million (including
timber value and estimated kaolin
deposit value), was a gift to the uni-
versity from Mary Johnson Ray in
memory of her deceased son. Pro-
ceeds are designated for the endow-
ment of the university’s School of
Medicine, which has a mission to
train physicians to serve in rural
Georgia.

cial value of preserving wildness
and a diversity of life for the future

he secrets of the deep prove more

than we can fathom, yet gliding ef-
fortlessly through this mysterious under-
world is another highly intelligent,
warm-blooded, air-breathing mammal
that possesses an intimate understanding
of this aquatic universe.

From antiquity, dolphins have sur-
faced through legend and lore as good
omens to fishermen and friendly com-
panions to those at sea. Aristotle studied
them. Plato philosophized about them.
And poets and writers from Homer to
Hemingway have admired and roman-
ticized them.

But it is only in this century that scien—
tists and psychologists have delved
deepest into the area of cognition and
dared to confront the question, “ls the
dolphin as intelligent, or perhaps even
more intelligent, than man?”

‘ There are some 50 or so known
species of dolphins bounding through
every ocean on earth — and even infiltrat-
ing some South American and Asian riv-
ers and streams.

Akin to the whale, cousin to the por-
poise, and in no way related to the game
fish ofthe same name, the dolphin has no
natural enemies in the wild aside from
the shark and the killer whale. Extremely
social creatures, they swim together in
family pods and can frequently be found
playing or free-wheeling on the bow
waves of boats.

Mammals in a sea of fish, they are
cetaceans that bear their young live,
suckle them with milk, and must surface
every few minutes for air. Breathing is
deliberate - not automatic — and if they
lose consciousness, they will stop
breathing and die. Dolphins sometimes

come to each other’s aid — on occasion
assisting a newborn or injured to the sur—
face to breathe. Adult dolphins have also
been known to assume the role of “aunt”
and babysit a calf while the mother for-
ages for food. Like humans, dolphins
suffer from afﬂictions such as pneu-
monia and stomach ulcers.

It was in the late l950s and l960$ that
John C. Lilly ﬁrst began seriously
exploring the possibility ofcommunicat-
ing with the dolphin. He chose this mam-
mal as the subject ofhis studies primarily
on the basis that the dolphin’s brain is as
large or slightly larger than the human
brain. Of his ground-breaking attempt at
human-dolphin communication, Lilly
wrote in Man and Dolphin (l957) of the
Atlantic bottle-nosed dolphin’s ability to
mimic sounds occurring in its environ-
ment.

Lilly hypothesized that dolphins can
repeat human sounds, but in order to one
day talk with them we must first forget
certain myths and preconceptions.
Counted among these “myths” are the
notions that no animal is as intelligent as
man, and that philosophical, contempla—
tive, and analytic thought are character-
istics only of man and not of any other
animal.

A tide of research and flood of dis
coveries evolved along with and in the
wake of Lilly’s work. Among the most
fascinating findings were the dolphin’s
use of sonar (SOund NAvigation Rang-
ing) and echolocation abilities.

At home in the murky waters of often-
turbid seas, the dolphin is able to “see”
remarkably well underwater through pul-
sating bursts of sound. By emitting a
series of high-frequency clicks, creaks,

"L. ' .' n m". -» .. a} -3-!V.-.',;11A4.1' ~ , .

and pings, they can determine the size,
shape, distance, speed, and perhaps even
the configuration and composition of an
object by interpreting the echo after the
sound strikes its target and bounces
back.

Echolocation is a phenomenon that re-
quires a complex system of identifying,
evaluating, and interpreting the reﬂected
sound. Though bats are believed to uti-
lize a similar sound-wave orientation and
identification system on land, the dol-
phin’s use of sonar and echolocation to
perceive objects and pinpoint schools of
moving fish for food are especially effec-
tive in the open ocean.

Anatomically, the dolphin differs
from humans in that its mouth is con-
nected directly to the stomach and not the
lungs. It breathes through a blowhole on
top of the head and the contour of its
smile is fixed in place — independent of
emotion. The head is adapted to sending
and receiving sound signals. It is be-
lieved that during echolocation the sig-
nals are emitted through the fatty tissue
in the forehead and the reﬂected sound is
transmitted to the brain through the jaw
and throat.

Dolphins have a much greater range of
hearing, functioning at higher frequen-
cies, than humans. But the full range of
dolphin sounds can be picked up elec-
tronically and played back at slower
speeds for the human ear to hear. And
dolphins apparently enjoy listening to
music — preferring classical composi-
tions and folk music to harsher heavy-
metal and rock ’n roll.

Immersed in an acoustical world, dol—
phins can also see quite well both in and
out of water, and possess a highly de-

veloped sense of touch. Generally speak-
ing, their utterances consist of a vast
array of clicks, grunts, squeaks, croaks,
pings, and whistles. Not enough is
known about telepathy to determine if
they do indeed have a sixth sense.

While earlier studies focused prima-
rily on interspecies human—dolphin com-
munication, more recent efforts are con—
centrating on intraspecies communica-
tion. Most experts believe the key to de-
coding the dolphin “language” lies in
first unlocking the way they communi-
cate among themselves in a natural envi-
ronment. Intelligence — and ultimately
intellect — may then be accurately deter—
mined once man and dolphin discover a
common “language” through which to
communicate.

The dawn of that day may not be far
away. Experiments are currently under-
way using artificial language and various
other computer-generated devices in an
attempt to “decode” the “language” of
the dolphin. At the forefront is psycholo—
gist Louis Herman, Ph.D. at the Univer-
sity of Hawaii’s Kewalo Basin Marine
Mammal Laboratory in Honolulu. Her-
man has structured an artificial language
that the dolphins have learned — in both

sign language as well as through hearing.

Another important ongoing study con-
centrating on dolphin communication
and their cognitive abilities is Project
Circe. Directed by Diana Reiss, Ph.D.,
the study began in 198! at the Marine
Mammal Research Center at Marine
World Africa USA in Vallejo, Califor-
nia.

Focusing on two Atlantic bottle—nosed
dolphins and their two offspring, the
project deals with their use of both vocal
and nonvocal signals to communicate.
Since the two calves were born in I983,
communication development and what
the young dolphins learn from their
mothers have been closely observed
from birth.

Recent findings by Reiss indicate that
dolphins do communicate with one
another through sonar and echolocation
clicks in conjunction with their visual
system.

“If they are close to- one another and
can see each other,” Reiss says, “they
often will use nonvocal signals.”

One of the most remarkable dis-
coveries is that most of what the young
dolphins do is learned behavior - even
echolocation.

, . .. , iunwglhi , .
Diana Reiss, Ph.D. directs a project at Marine Mammal Research

Center at Marine World Africa USA in Vallejo, Califomla
which concentrates on dolphin communication and cognition.

“No one really knew if dolphins were
born with echolocation abilities,” Reiss
says. “We‘ve found that they don’t
echolocate when they are born." After
the first month, she says. they learn sim-
ple echolocation, which then further de—
velops in complexity.

Every dolphin is believed to have a
signature, or identifying, whistle. Reiss,
through Project Circe, found that this
signature whistle is also developed. “The
youngster’s whistle looks a lot like the
mother’s whistle,” she says — which is
interesting in that similar signature whis-
tles may denote familial relations in the
wild.

Project Circe is also attempting to de—
code how dolphins communicate and
compile more information on their cog-
nitive processes. One experiment in-
volves an underwater keyboard.

Each key on the keyboard contains a
visual symbol and is interfaced with a
computer to produce a whistle or sound
when the dolphin hits a particular key. If
the dolphin hits a triangle, for example,
it will hear a specific whistle and the at-
tendant will hand the dolphin a corre-
sponding object like a ball. The dolphins
are not awarded food, but toys and ac-
tivities — which Reiss says is a very dif-
ferent approach to this type of study as
the dolphin’s input allows for rudimen—
tary control of its environment.

“We found that in the first weeks the
dolphins began to mimic computer whis-
tles,” Reiss says. “They produced the
sounds on their own before hitting the
visual symbol.” Of this learned associa-
tion, Reiss observes that the dolphins
began using signals and incorporating
them in their systems without benefit of
human help: “They did it on their own,”
she says.

“They are incredibly inquisitive, very
testing,” she says. “The minute you in-
troduce something new they will test it to
the limit. They are extremely social and
very flexible in their behavior patterns
and use of new information.” She also
says they demonstrate flexibility in their
play behavior. On occasion, they will
blow bubble rings and swim through
them — and in effect produce toys for
themselves. “You don‘t see this in other
animals,” Reiss says.

“You get the feeling,” she adds. “that
we’re dealing with another kind of intel-
ligence in a radically different environ-
ment.”

"You teach one something which takes a couple of
months to learn and the next week they all know
it!" observes Sea Life Park's curator of mammals.

Ingrid Shallenberger, curator of mam-
mals at Hawaii’s Sea Life Park has been
working with various dolphins and sea
lions since she began training them in
I965. Over the years. she has observed
that dolphins communicate a lot with
each other. “You teach one something
which takes a couple of months to learn
and the next week they all know it!” she

says.
Shallenberger also says that dolphins
are very cooperative with each other.

“They’re always right behind us when
we’re putting new locks on the gates,”
she says. “trying to figure out how to get
them open.” Often it will take two or
more and they have to cooperate to open
them.

During shows, trainers use hand or un-
derwater signals to cue the dolphins.
Often, a prop such as a ball will also be
used as a signal.

“Dolphins are very intelligent,” Shal-
lenberger says. “They learn very fast,

 

dolphins are quick learners. At San Diego’ 5 Sea World, animal- -care specialist Andy
Johnson, above, conducts behavioral observations on Commerson's dolphins.

but so do other animals like dogs and sea
lions.” But it’s what she terms the “Ah-
ha experience” that sets them apart from
other creatures in the animal kingdom.

“Dolphins suddenly understand,” she
says. “They get insight into, and like
‘Ah-ha, ’ they suddenly understand what
is to be learned.“

Like Flipper — the famous l9605 star
of the small screen — most top—of—the—bill
performers of shows nationwide at facili—
ties like the Sea Worlds, Miami Sea-
quarium, Michigan’s sFour Bears Water
Park, and Hawaii’s Sea Life Park are
bottle-nosed dolphins — the Atlantic and
Pacific variety. Ranging in length from
six to l4 feet and weighing in between
400 and l,000 pounds. the shoal-water
bottle-nosed dolphins are the most com-
mon cetaceans in captivity.

Currently charming spectators at San
Diego’s Sea World, however, are Com-
merson’s dolphins. These petite crowd-
pleasers, which are among the smallest
of their species, are only about four-and-
a-half feet long and weigh an average of
97 pounds. Found in the shallow coastal
waters off Argentina to the tip of South
America and eastward to the Falkland Is-
lands, as well as in the Indian Ocean,
they were first documented in I766 by
French naturalist Philibert Commerson.
Small, with distinctive black-and-white
markings, they are incredibly quick and
are equally adept at swimming upside-
down as rightside-up.

San Diego’s Sea World, which is cur-
rently working with four males, four
females, and the first-ever Commerson’s
born outside the wild, maintains the only
captive breeding colony of this seldom-
seen species. They are also first to
explore the Commerson’s learning
capabilities. And it appears the Commer-
son’s learn as quickly as other species of
dolphins.

Sea World specialists have been work-
ing with Commerson’s for about four-
and-a-half years —'spending the first four
observing and learning the best ways to
care for and train them. Shy by nature
(most probably because they are smaller,
hence they are prey for sharks and killer
whales), they were apprehensive of div-
ers at first but soon overcame their bash-
fulness and became affectionate stu-
dents.

“The progress has been phenomenal.’
says Andy Johnson, supervisorofanimal
care. “They seem to learn as quickly as

have to be on your toes to pick up on

It was discovered that they possess
similar systems of communication as
other species of dolphins, though they do
produce sounds at a much higher fre-
quency. And experts at Sea World don’t
yet know why.

“As we learn more about them, we’ll
be able to devise more research projects
like testing the range of hearing and other
aspects ofhearing,” Johnson says.

What is now known is that from
species to species, dolphins do have
similarly extraordinary learning capa—
bilities.

As we learn more about dolphins and
they learn more about us, the designa-
tions of student and teacher seem to be
exchanged back and forth daily — much
like the ebb and ﬂow of the tide. Balanc-
ing on the delicate shores of the Gulf of
Mexico in the Florida Keys is the Dol-
phin Research Center, where dolphins

have recently assumed the role of
teachers in assisting handicapped chil—
dren to learn.

Located on Grassy Key northeast of
Marathon, the Center is a nonprofit facil-
ity devoted to dolphin research and pro—
moting mutually beneficial human-dol-
phin interaction. Through their Dolphin
Encounter program, all are invited to
swim with the dolphins. There. the em-
phasis is on education. Many of the ceta—
cean “stars” of movies like Splash, Co-
coon, and The Big Blue reside there.

Psychologist David Nathanson,
Ph.D. , who heads the dolphin-child pro-
gram, completed the ﬁrst phase of a
study last August that utilized Atlantic
bottle—nosed dolphins to increase the at-
tention and learning capacity of mentally
handicapped children. In the six—month
program, dolphins were asked to interact
with the children in efforts to improve
their speech and memory. During the
lessons, picture books were tossed out to
the dolphins and, in order for them to re-

trieve them, the children would have to
say the words.

“Two things hold a child‘s attention,”
Nathanson says. “Animals and music.
What animal would best hold the atten-
tion of kids? It was a choice between
chimps and dolphins. Chimps are often
aggressive, but dolphins seem to relax
the kids.”

With the assistance of the dolphins,
who pushed boards back to the kids and
were an active part of both the stimulus
and reinforcement, Nathanson says the
children learned between two and ten
times faster. He calls the project “enor-
mously successful” in many ways.

“The dolphins seemed to sense that
these kids are handicapped,” he says.
“They picked up on the mobility prob-
lems. They were very patient with the
children.” He also spoke ofone dolphin,
Natua (who graces the pin—up poster pro-
moting The Big Blue) who would spon-
taneously dive and get presents like
rocks and bring them back to the kids on
hisown.

“When one child who is a spastic
quadriplegic was swimming, Little Bit
went under the water for a minute, just
watching,” he says. “She then came up
and kissed the child on the Cheek. She’s
never done that be fore.”

The dolphins are very affectionate and
they pick up on cues, he says. “They per-
ceive these children as a little more help-
less than people they normally swim
with. That’s a real sign ofintelligence.”

Just how intelligent?

“The problem is that measures of
human intelligence don’t exist in an
aquatic environment,” Nathanson says.
“No such concepts exist like words and
speech Obviously, they are very
bright. Maybe here we’ll discover how
intelligent they are.”

Maybe.

But we must slip deeper still into the
dolphin’s world. If they do indeed hold
the key to solving the interspecies—com-
munication puzzle, we may soon be free
to exchange thoughts, information, and
ideas with all ofthe earth’s species.

For now, it’s only fair to say that dol-
phins are as intelligent in their world as
we are in ours.

"Mono Lake has 190 miles east
of San Francisco at the base of the
steep eastern escarpment of the
Sierra Nevada mountain range.
Born some half-million years ago,
it is one of the oldest lakes in
North Merica. Lands around the
lake have been raked by glaciers
and remain volcanicly active even
today. Each year, millions of birds
return to the lake to enact a finely
tuned drama of survival.

Mono Lake. The lake is a “terminal
lake" (nonatural outlets), and wa-
ter entering the lake from rainfall,
snow melt and springs brings dis-
solved ions As the water evapo
rates, ions are concentrated, lead
ing to increased salinity.

Mono Lake today is 25 tithes
as salty as the Pacific Ocean. This
special chemistry 0f the water — a
combination of high salinity and
high alkalinity — is critical to the

‘gcharacter of the lake. As calcium

in fresh water springs entering the

the lake water, picturesque tower- ?

Even so, the authors tell as,
the lake is an astonishingly pro-
dactive ecosystem. Benthic and
planktoaic algae form the base of
the food chain and support im-
mense numbers of brine shrimp
and brine flies. The great but sea
sonal productivity of these inver-
tebrates, the study asserts, permits
millions of birds. to use Mono Lake
as a source of food. These birds
time their visits to coincide with
the late summer explosions in
brine shrimp and brine fly popula-

. tions.

.Each fall as many Ins—900,000
cared Igrebes descend on Mono

r. Lake to gorge themselves on brine

shrimp and brine ﬂies during a,
migration stepover. As many as-
70,000 shrimp per day are consume
ed by each bird. The study claims

that the cared grebes at Mono

Lake max represent nearly one-

third of the North American popu-
“ lllion of this species.

As many as one-fourth of the
worldwide population of Califor-
nia gulls also depend on Mono
Lake for survival Some 50, 000
gulls come each spring to nest on

' islands and islets in the lake and to
rear their chicks on the bountiful
brine shrimp. Mono Lake is also
the largest sta g area in western
North America or migrating Wil-
son’s phalaropes, the study adds.
Nearly 100, 000 of these shorebirds ;
stop to rest and feed on the lake’s I
brine shrhp and brine files be- ‘
fore commencing a nunstop migra-
tion to South America. .

 




Now, here is the rub. As the
water level in Mono Lake drops,
ethe salinity of the water increases.
- Upsetting the lake’s chemistry
might not physiologically affect
the birds, but it mostcertainly will
diminish the reproductive success
and survival of their food. If the
brine shrimp and brine flies-deep—
pear from Mono Lake, sotoo will
the birds. The study leaVes no
doubt that hard decisions about
the management of the lake must
bemade now- ,

sicns. A risk assessment vanalyzes

courses of action, thereby afford-
ing managers options to decide
just how much. risk is acceptable.
“The Mono Basin'icosystenr” is or-
ganized and presented as a classic
environmental risk " ssessment. It
explains in schOIarly detail the en-
‘vironmental consequences of ris-
ing and falling lake levels on a
variety of the lake’s resources —
crine shrimp, brine flies, birds, tu-
fa, air quality, shoreline vegeta-
tion,‘ riparian vegetation and
freshwater fish.

Today, Mono Lake stands at
an elevation of 6380 feet above sea
level. At this level, 40 feet below its

_ historic elevation, the air quality,
; shoreline vegetation, riparian veg-
' etation and freshwater fish have
i already been adversely affected. If
the level of the lake were to fall
another ten feet, to an elevation of
8370 feet, the brine fly and bird
populations would joinjthe list of
adversely affected resources. If
the lake level were to fall 20 feet
from today’s elevation, to 6360
feet, no resource studied by the
cOmmittee would escape unaffect-

we know it would likely collapse.

Much of the data comes from the

that Mono Lake’s acute ecological

study, however, reports quite a dif
ferent scenario.

The less dense freshwater i11-

the denser saline lake water, re-
sulting in a condition known to
limnologists as meromixis. A per-

sistent chemical stratification has
formed in Mono Lake with an up- ;

water in Mono Lake cannot fully
circulate from top to bottom each
year as it did in the past This 111-

f. hibited water circulation deprives

the lake’s algae of vital nutrients
that in turn reduces productivity.

The effect snowballs throughout '

the simple food chain in Mono
Lake.

In an interesting but unex-
plored assertion, the committee
claims that among the various an-
thrOpogenic impacts on the Mono
Basin, the most widespread results

arguments that unfairly deprive
the public of the environmental

Eeotage, or nonviolent environmental

and artifacts of industry. It is inconceivable
that whoever drove the spike into that tree

Although Crowell’s tenure in office was

stained the appointments of James Watt,
former secretary of the interior, and Anne

Alexander’s injury occurred at a Lou'niana-

militant environmentalists

hose militant environmentalists come

from all stations of life; they may be

ranchers, roughneclrs, housewives or
students. They are no less impassioned than
the underground radicals of the ’60s and
they have been driven to ecotage by count-
less reasons.

It was the US. Forest Service’s second
Roadless Area Review and Evaluation
(BARE II) in 1978, a program intended to
inventory and designate for protection na-
tional wilderness areas, that drove Dave
Foreman, then the chief Washington, DC,
lobbyist for the Wilderness Society, to for-
sake the mainstream environmental move-
ment and take up the defense of the wilder-
ness with his bare hands

0f the more than 80 million acres of
roadloss wilderness identified within US.
national forests by RARE 11, only 15 million
were recommended for protection against
logging, mineral extraction, road-building
and other developments. To Foreman, the 65
million acres of wilderness given away in
the spirit of compromise during RARE II
represented not only a chilling betrayal of
the wilderness by those agencies charged

with its rotection, but also a vivid demon-
stration hi the environmental movements
increasing temerity. .
Foreman quit his job and headedWest,
and in 1980, driving around in a van in the
Pinacate Desert of Mexico, he and several
others formed a loosely organized group ol
environmental radicals called .Earth FII‘St:
The organization openly champions ecotage,

its newsletter details the most effective
means of damaging heavy construction
equipment, destroying roads already cutan-
to wilderness areas, spiking trees, cutting
down billboards and other acts of ecotage.

' The strategyofecotage is simple: “Many
of- the projects that will-destroy .roadless
areas are economically marginal,” Foreman
wrote in'“Ecodefense:~A- Field Guide to Mon-
keywrenchingg” “It is costly for the Forest
Service, Bureau'of Land Management, tim-
be‘r companies-nil companies, and others to
scratch out the resources in-these’ last wild
areas. It is expensive to maintain that infra-
structure of roads for the exploitation of
wild lands. The cost of repairs, the hassle,
the delay, the down-time may be just too
much for the bureaucrats to accept if there
_ is a widely dispersed, unorganized, strategic
movement of resistance across the land.”

Foreman’s infamous tome was enthusi-

. astically embraced by militant environmen-

. talists throughout the West. The book quick-
: ly sold out its first printing. It has been
revised and updated in its second printing.

 

certain to continue lies with the dra-

 

"'he single greatest reason ecotage is

movement in recent years.

alty to the political process than to conserva-

for an overwhelming love of wild nature but
because they passionately enjoy the glam-
our, excitement and prestige of the Poto-
mac. It is a roll-call vote in the House that
mesmerizes them, not goose music.”

Like Foreman, many militant environ-
mentalists once were members of national
environmental organizations like the Wil-
derness Society and the Sierra Club. But as
the organizations’ memberships grew and
they carried their battles on behalf of the
environment to the halls of Congress, those
members felt betrayed and abandoned as
they watched their local concerns take a
back seat to national and international is-
sues.

Expensive is the keyio why militant
environmentalists believe ecotage' is the
most effective means of defending the wil-
derness. They charge it is naive to believe
corporate profit margins will ever be sacri-
ficed to preserve the wilderness. Louisiana-
Pacific does not exist to protect Northern
California’s old-growth forests; it exists to
harvest and mill timber and to return, a
profit to its shareholders; and it is foolish to
expect a timber company to preserve those
resources it must harvest to survive.

The mainstream environmental move- _

ment depends upon emotional appeals ex-
tolling the beauty of the wilderness; cum-
bersome, costly and lengthy legal chal
lenges; and, finally, corporate and
governmental largesse. Militant environ-
mentalists like Foreman believe that spiked
trees, “desurveyed” roads and damaged or
. destroyed equipment pose the only truly
meaningful threat to the corporate bottom
line.
Illegal? Of course.

. Effective? Ecotage is costing the na-
tion’s timber, oil and gas, and mineral explo-
ration companies hundreds of thousands of
dollarseach year.

Moral? That is for the environmental
l

, I don’t believe the moral issues here are
limited totliequestionsofviolatingthelaw
or jeopardizing the health and safety of log-
gers and millworkers like George Alexan~

tier After all, the lumber industry is one of
the most danger-om industries in the nation,
andoLouisiana-Pacific and other timber com-
panies appear to operate comfortably de-
spite clear and undeniable risks to their

workers .

In fact, there are a great man wa

injury to Alexander. It might have eliminat-
ed his dangerous job (this has been done at
other LouisianaPacific mills in Northern
California and is scheduled to be done at the
C'loverdale mill as part of a $5 million mill

- renovation slated for December). It could

have promptly heeded employee warnings
abdut worn equipment (Alexander claims he
had been complaining to company officials
about the condition of his band saw for
several weeks; he also clam the saw had
been hitting pieces of metal on the average
of four times a week before the accident).

To me, the 'larger moral issue is how we

- can stand idly by as our precious wild lands
. are destroyed in pursuit of no holier grail

than corporate black ink.

in this remote valley on the lﬂm'th
Fork of the Flathead River.

The howls of a wolf packmun—
heard in the West for half a
century—are once more echoing
off the stony peaks in ‘ Glacier
National Park. Biologists tracking
this group report that individual
wolves have recently split away
from the pack to form two more
packs that are now ranging nearby,
along the U. S. -Canadian border.

Farther down the west side of
the Continental Divide, a few lone
wolves are prowling the Selway-
Bitterroot Wilderness in central
Idaho. In all, 20 to 30 wolves are
moving south slowly in a migration
that may or may not Succeed.

Importing Canadian Wolves

In an attempt to assure the wolf’s
comeback, the Na Park Ser-
vice wants to cap .. e Canadian
wolves and rein ce them in
Yellowstone National Park, 400
miles south of the border.

Wolves were once a natural part
of the Rockies, and’the absence of
these predators is the single
greatest departure from. .main-
taining a natural ecosystem in
Yellowstone,” according to a Park
Service policy statement “Now is
the time to reintroduce the
wolves,” Yellowstone Supt. Robert
Barbee said in an interview

see reduced. ~

if However, the wolf’s future in
Yellowstone and the West is still
very much in doubt. Ranchers,
politicians and environmentalists
are locked in a battle over whether
wolves should be put back in
Yellowstone or anywhere else.
Cattle ranchers are afraid that the
wolves could never be contained
within a national park or wilder-
ness area.

“I don’t want the wolf near me,"
grumbled Wyoming cattleman
Jack Turnell, owner of the
120,000-acre Pitchfork Ranch
southwest of Cody.

Echoing those sentiments, sheep
rancher James Siddoway, president
of the Idaho Wool Growers Assn.,
said, “If we allow reintroduction of
the wolf . -. . we won’t be be able to
control depredation on livestock,
nb matter what they [protwolf
advocates] say.” ' .

The predator they fear is Cam‘s
lupus irremotus, one of 24 subspe-
cies of gray wolf that once inhabit-

ed most of North America. Larger
than its Eastern cousins, the male
Rocky Mountain wolf weighs 100- ,
plus pounds and stands 30 inches at
the shoulder. These animals live in f’
small, tightly organized family
groups. Each pack is dominated by
an alpha male and female, the only
mating pair in the group. The
wolves are highly social and often
playful among themselves but they

shy away from people.
Appeared Six Years Ago

While wolves in the Lower 48
states‘ were wiped out by settlers,
hunters and government trappers, .
they survived and even flourished .‘
in the wilds of Canada and Alaska. "
No reproducing pair of Rocky.

Mountain wolves had been seen in
the Western United States in more
than 50 years until a pair appeared
on the Flathead River six years
a .
ggi’hile stockmen may still believe
wolves are savage beasts, the pub-
lic’s attitude seems to be changing.
Park Service surveys of Yellow-
stone visitors show that they no
longer believe that wolves are the
evil creatures depicted in fables.
Opinion polls in nearby states show
strong public support for a return
of the wolf.

But this positive image suffered a
setback last June when a pack of
seven wolves began killing live-
stock on the Blackfeet Indian Res-
ervation near the town’of Brown-
ing, Mont, east of the Continental
Divide. Wolf experts claim that this
rogue pack went after livestock
because game was scarce on the
reservation. But stockmen who
graze cattle on the prairies east of

Glacier scoffed, saying, “A wolf is a
wolf." ~

The Indians are also divided .on
theissue. Fred Crossgans. a ranch-
er' and tribal game warden, called
in federal We to help elimi-
nate the wolves, while Blackfeet

' traditionalistsprotested the killing.

Buster Yellow Kidney explained:
“The old Indians lived side by side

‘ withthewolf. . . .Theywerevery

much a part of our sacred ways."
The controversy over bringing

wolves back to the Rockies has

pitted National Park Service Di-

rector William Penn Mott Jr.--who '

favors the plane-against the state
governments of Montana, Wyo-

: ming and Idaho, plus the powerful

Wyoming congressional delegation
that has taken the issue directly to
Mott’s boss, Interior Secretary

" Donald P. Hodel.

“I am every bit as committed to
preventing government introduc-
tion of wolves in Yellowstone as
Bill Mott is determined to put them
there,” Rep. Dick Cheney (R-
Wyo.) wrote Hodel, warning, “If
he [Mott] wants a fight, I am
ready.”

Wolf Recovery Plan

Normally, the Park Service has a
broad mandate to act on its oWn in
such matters, but because the wolf
is an endangered species, the final
decision on reintroduction rests
with the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service, administrators of the Eu-
dangered Species Act. Both the
Park . Service and the Fish and
Wildlife Service are agencies of the
Interior Department.

As required by the act, the Fish
and Wildlife Service prepared a
“Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf
Recovery Plan.” The plan, which
was approved this summer, calls

‘for the reintroduction of 30 breed-

ing pairs of wolves into wilderness
areas, 10 each in northern Mon-
tana, central Idaho and Yellow-
stone National Park. The reintro-
duction appears to be occurring
naturally in Glacier and in the

.Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness but,

because Yellowstone is so far from
the Canadian border, the wolves
probably would have to be trans-
planted there.

Mott applauded the plan and
announced that he would press for
the reintroduction of wolves in
Yellowstone. Ranchers and their

political allies then redoubled their

opposition to

 

 

wolves in Yellow- ‘
tone, this time taking their (com-
;laints directly to the White House,
according to a spokesman for Sen.
Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo. ).
Immediately controversial, the

recovery plan put Fish and Wildlife
Service Director Frank H. Dunkle
in an awkward position. A conser-
vative Montana Republican ap-
pointed in 1986, Dunkle found him-
self opposing a plan that his agency
had prepared and that he had
earlier approved. Responding to
questions about Mott’s attempts to
launch wolf recovery in Yellow-
stone, Dunkle told The Times, “I’m
not going to be a party to reintro-
ducing wolves. . .anywhere.”
Top Interior Department officials
refused to discuss the conflict be—
tween Mott and Dunkle, but a
spokesman for Hodel said: “Mr.
Dunkle is our spokesman. . . . He
is responsible for whatever action
doesor does not take place.”

Environmental Groups

Lined up with the Park Service
on the pro-wolf side of the battle
are powerful environmental organ-
izations such as the Defenders of
Wildlife and the National Wildlife
Federation.

“It’s really important that we, as

_ a nation, restore this predator to

the world’s premier park . . . send
a message, that predators are im-
portant and have a place in the
mcosystem,” said Defenders
’spokesman Hank Fischer.

Until six years ago, arguments
over the wolf were academic. Oc-
casionally, lone wolves had been
reported as far south as Yellow-

; stone, but there were no known

wolf packs anywhere in the
Rockies until the single mating pair

- settled in the North Fork country

in 1981, according to Robert Ream,
a wildlife biologist. Ream directs
the University of Montana’s feder-
ally funded Wolf Ecology Project,
set up to study the wolf re-entry
into the northern Rockies.

The wolf pair and their seven
pups became the nucleus of the
“Magic Pack,” Ream said, explain-
ing that the name'was given be-
cause the pack would disappear for
long periods, then reappear some-
where else “as if by male.”

Working on a shoestring budget,
Ream and his two assistants began
tracking the pack, winter and sum-
mer. Over the years seven of the
wolves were captured, fitted with
radio collars and released so their
movements could be traced from a
low-ﬂying airplane. By 1985 the
Magic Pack had staked out territo-
ry on Camus Creek, in Glacier

, National Park, 35 miles south of the

border. Then came another litter,
the first born in a Western national
park since the early part of the
century. ,

Last winter something happened
that Ream and other researchers

 




r s -

had never seen before. The Magic.

j Pack— -numbering 12 by this
,. t1me—divided and soon divided a

second time, ferming three inde-
pendent groups, each dominated by
an alpha male and female. This past
season the three packs produced 16
pups, bringing the total population
in the three groups to 26.

However, not all of the news was
good for Ream. Nine wolves from
two of the. packs were killed by
Canadian hunters this fall before
Ream convinced authorities in
British Columbia that the hunt was
jeoparding the wolves’ existence
in the United States. The hunt was
closed Oct. 23.

Despite this loss, Ream is still
optimistic about the future of the
wolves along the Flathead. The

surviving wolves are well estab-
lished, and Ream said Dunkle has
agreed to fund the university study
for at least another year.

More worrisome for Beam and
other wolf experts are the wolf
attacks on livestock this summer
on the 1.5-million-acre Blackfeet
Indian Reservation, east of the
Continental Divide. While there is
no apparent connection between
this rogue pack and the wolves
being studied by Ream, wildlife
experts fear the political reaction to
livestock kills could set back wolf
recovery everywhere.

_ The Blackfeet reservation abuts

Glacier Park’s eastern boundary. It
is land of open prairies creased by
meandering streams. The river
bottoms, shaded by aspens and
willows, are a haven for antelope,
elk, deer—and now wolves.

Nearly a third of the reservation
land was sold to white ranchers
like Roy Williams, 75, who came to
the area half a century ago. Rug-
ged, uncompromising men, they
fought grizzlies, Cougars, wolves,
coyotes and fierce winters to make
their ranges safe for cattle and
sheep. This summer the pack of
seven wolves began killing their
stock but, because the animal is an
endangered species, the ranchers
could no longer shoot them.

“The parks are for the wolf, but
when they get out on the range, it’s
the wolf that’s the outlaw, not me,”
said Williams, a snowy-haired
Lorne Green look-alike. Riding tall
in the saddle, the rancher showed
visitors the remains of one of his
cows. “Those bleeding hearts [who
favor the wolf] should have to
watch wolves eating their way
through $5,000.” That, he said, is
the value of the stock he has lost in
the past year.

Before government hunters

, the US. Fish and Wildlife Service
‘ for “lethal authority.” After some

delay, permimion was granted.
Using a helicopter, nets, riﬂes
and even a “Judas wolf’ ’ that had
been captured, ﬁtted with a radio
collar and released again, the trap-

. pers set out after the raiding

wolves in July. But the wily wolves
proved surprisingly elusive. It took
two months and $41,000 to rid the

'_‘reservation of six of the seven

animals. Meanwhile, ranchers and

‘ their political allies pointed to what

was happening around Browning

and demanded that wolves be kept
out of Yellowstone.

Dunkle agreed. He said the

; wolves had left the elk herds in
i Glacier Park to prey on livestock,

adding “There is nothing to say
i that if the wolf was introduced into

Yellowstone, it wouldn’t do the
same thing there.”
Most Prefer Elk, Deer

Wildlife experts disagree. They
say that most wolves prefer elk and

deer and that the rogue pack .
, probably wouldn’ t have been kill—

ing livestock if there had been
game on the reservation. Earl Old

Person, chairman of the Blackfeet

'"Tiiibal Council, acknOwIedged'the
scarcity of elk, explaining that both
hunger and unemployment are

1 high on the reservation, forcing

Indians to kill game all year long to
survive.

“Wolf depredations on livestock
are neither as widespread nor as
serious as generally believed,” ac—
cording to John Weaver, a U. S.
Forest Service biologist and mem-
her of the wolf recovery team
advising the Fish and Wildlife
Service. After reviewing scientific
Wolf studies in Canada, Alaska and

Minnesota—where there are large
populations of Eastern timber
wolves—Weaver concluded that
wolves would normally bypass do-
mestic livestock, given a chance at
wild prey.

Proponents of wolf recovery
quickly acknowledge that some
wolf predation can be expected, but
they say the numbers would be
small and the problem can be
controlled.

“It’s wrong to say that Wolves
don’t cause problems. . . . Wolves
that get into conflicts like those at
Browning must be killed,” said
Tom France, of the National Wild-
life Federation. He pointed out that

‘ such problems are controlled in

Minnesota, where 1,200 wolves live
in forest wild lands next to live-
stock ranges and small farms.
Livestock kills in these areas are
small and farmers are compensated
for their losses, he said.

France pointed out that under
guidelines set out in the Fish and
Wildlife Service’s wolf recovery
plan, the wolves reintroduced into
Yellowstone would be classified as
an “experimental population,” al-
lowing government trappers to
trap or kill any animals that
strayed out of bounds and killed
livestock.

Ample Base in Yellowstone

Most experts think that the
wolves would have an ample base
in Yellbwstone Park’s 2.2 million
acres. In addition to the 30,000 elk
ranging there, there are 3,000 bi-
son, 2,000 deer and hundreds of
antelope and moose. Park biologists
say 10 wolf packs would help
'control an overabundance of some
of these game animals.

Before it could introduce wolves
into Yellowstone, the Park Service
would have to prepare an environ-
mental impact statement, a process
that would take two years, Supt.
Barbee said. If the impact state-
ment is approved after extensive
public hearings, the Park Service
would then have to get permits
from the Fish and Wildlife Service
to import the wolves, Barbee said.
He added, "We can’t proceed with-
out Dunkle’s blessing.”

In the meantime, the Magic
Pack’s recolonizing efforts in the
northern Rockies are being
watched by experts like L. David
Mech, director of wolf studies at
the US. Fish and Wildlife Service’s
wildlife research center in St. Paul,
Minn.

“The wolf’s chances of recovery
in the West are slowly improving
and the main reason for that is
what is happening there in Mon-
tana,” Mech said.

However, it was hard for him to
be overly optimistic with only 19
wolves surviving on the North
Fork. He said that wolf recovery is
now “at a critical point,” adding
that if the three packs thrive for .
another two years, “we won’t be so i
worried.”

Honorable Sam Nunn
Honorable wyche Fowler
Honorable Pat Swindall
Congressmen from Georgia
Washington, DC

Gentlemen:

As you and 1 all know, the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals Amend—
ment to the Animal Welfare.Act was passed the end of 1985, and went into
effect December 23, 1986. However, its enforcement is hindered by lack of
the necessary regulations to do the job.

I am asking all three of you to demand that the good proposed regulations,
written by the Animal Care Staff of the Dept. of Agriculture's Veterinary
Services, be issued promptly as final regulations.

Please - each of you — write to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Dir—
ector of the Office of Management and Budget and ask them to do the follow-
1mg:

1) See that the regulations published in the Federal Rrgiser on
March 31, 1987 be made final WITHOUT WEAKENING AMENDMENTS.
These constitute Parts I and II. In some instances, clarify-
ing statements, to prevent misunderstandings, would be appro—
priate, but the regulations should be not weakened, despite
the pressures of those in the business of selling animals to
research laboratories.

 

2) The proposed regulations for Part III should be published
promptly.

I am grateful to the members of Congress who voted for this Act, but no
Act or Law means a thing unless it is properly funded, and unless it is
being enforced.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough
P.S. Please let me know how you acted on this letter.

old habitat

Nearly extinct animal
is reintroduced in NC.

By Hunter James
Staff Writer

MANN’S HARBOR, N.C. --
Once nearly extinct, the American
red wolf again roams the cane-
brakes and river bottoms of this
sparsely settled coastal region.

The US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice introduced the wolves — three
males and three females - into an
area that once was their natural
habitat, and even today is more
plentifuny supplied with bear and
deer than with humans. They are
bred from 14 genetically pure red
wolves at a zoo in Tacoma, Wash.

 

 

“It’s the first time an animal
extinct in the wild has ever been in-
troduced into his native habitat,”
the agency’s assistant regional di-
rector, Don Pfitzer, said. “Every-
thing we do, we are learning some-
thing new.”

The wolves were freed into the :
refuge in May, and officials say ‘3
they may have taken to their new

home; the natives apparently have
taken to the wolves.

“Some of the hunters have com-
plained about the way the Fish and
Wildlife peoaille have managed the
land,” said ris Wise, Dare County
farm extension agent. “They think
there are too many restrictions and
that they are taking away a tradi-
tional way of life. But so far as the
red wolf is concerned, I don’t think
they give a hoot about it.”

Nor do farmers seem to mind,
he said, since all of Dare County’s
5,000 acres of farmland — the rest
mostly belongs to the federal gov—
ernment — is under absentee own-

 

ership and used primarily for the
cultivation of corn and soybeans.

“People are actually pretty ex.
cited about the whole thing,” Wise
said. “It’s an experiment, and a lot
of people moved here to be a little
closer to nature, and a lot of them
appreciate the fact that the red
wolves are back.”

The Fish and Wildlife Service
has monitored the red wolves, fol—
lowin their every move by means
of co ars equipped with telemetric
devices. One wolf wandered into the
streets of Man’s Harbor about a

month ago and was seized immedi- .
ately by game wardens and re- i.

turned to its new wilderness home.
The red wolf, said Pfitzer, is by

nature timid and no threat to hu- .
mans or farm animals. Unlike the ’

gray wolf, which travels in packs
and still haunts the forests of the
far north, feeding off elk, moose

and deer, Dare County’s newest res-

ident prefers his own company and
preys primarily on small game: rab-
bits, squirrels and mice.

The wolves have been taught
from birth to be “people-shy,”
Pfitzer said.

“We don’t want them thinking

~people,” Pfitzer said in Atlanta.

"We don’t even want them thinking
cars.” .

The Dare County refuge is near
Roanoke Island, site of the first

‘Eu lish settlement in America, and

inc rides the Outer Bank resort

towns of Nags Head, Kill Devil
Hills and Kitty Hawk.

Of Dare County’s 20,000 perma-
nent human residents, only about
400 inhabit the mainland portion,
and most of those are clustered
about the tiny settlements of Mann’s
Harbor, East Lake and Stumpy

. Point.

Few likely are ever to see the
wolves again, now that they have

- vanished into the wilds. It will be

another five years before the agen-
cy is prepared to pronounce the ex-

periment an unqualified success.

“Even if our wildest dreams
come true, there will never be more
than 25 or 30 of the animals in that

’ whole peninsula there,” Pfitzer said.
“The area will not support more :

than that.”

If the experiment proves suc-
cessful, the agency will consider in-
troducing the wolves elsewhere in
the Southeast.

“We still have a lot to learn,”
Pfitzer said. “We know very little

‘about the red wolf because his habi-

tat disappeared very early.”

To really pamper your pet, as well as your-
self, check out The Argyle spa north of Dal-
las. It’s the only spa in the country that ac-
commodates pets as luxuriously as their

A Word of caution: If you’re thinking about

pampering your pet with a completely home-

made diet, you’re barking up the wrong tree,
according to several Dallas area veterinari-
ans. They strongly discouraged us from pro-
v1ding a recipe for homemade pet food

According to these animal ekperts, manu—

facturers of pet foods have spent millions of
dollars researching the best possible combi-
nations of foods to provide a healthy and safe
diet for your pet. One of the biggest pitfalls
of preparing your pet’s food at home is keep-
ing it properly balanced in nutrients.

For instance, for older pets, a diet too high
in protein can be severely harmful to their
kidneys. There also is the risk of disease if
homemade pet food is not prepared or stored
properly. -

For your pet’s best nutrition, we recom-
mend contacting your veterinarian for infor-
mation. An excellent source of dog care in-
formation (and a thoughtful gift for any dog
owner) is “The Dog Care Manual” byDavid
Alderton (Barrens, 1986). ‘

1 Cats Thrown to Pit Bulldog
 -— 4 Prison Guards Punished

By Erik Ingram

Four guards at a state pris-
on camp in Mendocino County
were punished with temporary
pay cuts for amusing them-
selves by tossing dozens of stray
cats to a killer pit bulldog. offi-
cials said yesterday.

Department of Corrections
spokesman Bob Gore said the
gnards were administratively disci-
plined last month for their actions.
which took place in 1985 at the
Chamberlain Creek Conservation
Camp. He said it took two years to
investigate the cat killings, and the
matter is now closed.

But Mendocino County District
Attorney Susan Massini. saying she
was “outraged by what I‘ve heard."
plans to have. her staff investigate
the affair to see if felony charges
for'animal cruelty can be filed.

Meanwhile. state Forestry De
partment employees who reported
the abuses complained that Correc~
tions mishandled its inquiry.

some;

The gruesome practice alleged.
ly occurred over a four-month peri.
od in late 1985 when between 40 and
60 cats were tossed to Skillet. the
camp‘s unofficial mascot.

Targets of the complaints are
Richard Nelson. Ruben Silva. David
Gardner and Kenneth Kinder. All
four have denied any wrongdoing.

State documents on the inci-
dent. released by the personnel
board after three of the guards ap-
pealed the pay cuts, describe how
inmates were encouraged by the
guards to trap stray cats with pieces
of fish. stuff them in gunnysacks
and then release them in the camp
dayroom.

Skillet was then turned loose as

ed the grisly scene through win-

they were threatened by guards
with punitive action if they com-
plained about the activity. eventual-

ment of Forestry personnel who so
pervise the convicts on work details
such as fighting fires and reseeding
forests.

(overup Charge

 

Two of those employees told
The Chronicle yesterday that they
believe the Department of Correc-
tions tried to “cover up” the matter.

Forestry Captain Kenneth Di-
als and his boss. Ranger Conie Rob-
ertson. said they investigated the
inmates‘ stories, found mutilated
dead cats on camp property, and
reported it to the officer in charge
of the camp. Lieutenant Tom Mur-
ry. But one of the guards accused of

son. was assigned to investigate the
complaints along with another offi~
cer.

In December 1986, Dials filed a
criminal complaint with the Mendo
cino County Sheriff '5 Department.

The Sheriff’s Department re-
ferred the case to the state Depart-
ment of Justice, which declined to
investigate and instead turned it
back over to the Department of Cor-
rections.

Eight-Month Probe

At this point. state records
show corrections officials in Sacra-
mento assigned one of their investi-
gators who. after an eight-month
investigation. including polygraph
tests on nearly a dozen inmates. con-
cluded that the allegations were
trUe.

 

The investigator also conclud-
ed that the case. could not be prose-

cuted criminally because of a one-
year statue of limitations on misde-
meanors.

The department then took ad
ministrative action against the four
guards. Gardner and Kinder will
lose $750 in pay. Silva will lose $2,800
and Nelson will forfeit $3.150.

Gore said no administrative ac-
tion was taken against higherrank
ing Corrections employees. even
though they were found to have
interfered with the initial investiga-
tion or failed to follow through.

Statute of limitations

 

District Attorney Massini said
the corrections department is
wrong in its conclusion that the cat
killings were misdemeanors and
can not be prosecuted because of a
oneyear statute of limitations.

“These are still allegations. but
if true, they are felonies." she said.
adding the statute of limitations for
felonies is three years.

Skillet. meanwhile. has been re-
moved from the prison grounds and
tow lives in Robertson‘s backyard.

“He‘s a nice dog that I used to
see sleeping with cats at the camp."
the. ranger said. “That was before
they agitated him and created a cat
killer."

The American crocodile, shy and retiring extinction. But scientist believe the reptile may

around people, has been pushed to the brink of be recovering.

Researchers help crocodile
in battle against extinction

By CATHERINE WILSON
of The Associated Press

MIAMI — Maintenance workers were surprised
when they dug into a gravel pile and uncovered a
clutch of crocodile eggs at Everglades National Park.

An endangered American crocodile had taken the
gravel as a close approximation of a natural nesting
mound. But the secretive reptile hadn’t counted on dis-
covery.

The white eggs were carefully removed and incu-
bated by a researcher, and the week-old hatchlings
were released close to the makeshift nest.

The happy ending was assured by scientists intent
on pushing the hulking loners back from the brink of
extinction.

Confined in the United States to three breeding
grounds south of Miami, the complacent reptiles de-
bunk their Hollywood image as the fierce fighters in
“Tarzan” movies.

Males can grow to 15 feet, females almost 13 feet.

“Most people don’t differentiate a crocodile from an
alligator,” said park spokeswoman Pat Tolle. “It’s a big
reptile with big feet and teeth. If you pin them down
they might say they were dark or light or had a pointy
snout”

. Alligators have proliferated in recent years after
coming under federal protection and a hunting pro-
gram was initiated to help control the population.

Two of the 11 crocodile species in the world are
man-eaters, but the variety found in South Florida and
along the Caribbean coast are content to shy away from
people.

“There has never been a reported incident of a
crocodile attack on a human,” said Lt. Larry Lawrence
of the state Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.

“Because of the publicity they’ve received in the
past, a lot of people are very afraid of the word ‘croco-
dile,’ ” said Lawrence, the chief environmental en-
forcement officer on the Florida Keys, one of the three

 

f breeding grounds in South Florida.

. Seldom researched before it made the. endangered
species list in 1973, the American crocodile appeared

headed for extinction. Only 20 nesting females were

counted 10 years ago, but that number was up to 29 this
year, giving scientists some optimism that the specres is
recovering. The total Florida population IS believed to

hover around 450.

Frank Mazzotti, a University of Florida wildlife biol-
ogist, suspects the number of breeding females has in-
creased because he’s better at finding nests after 10
years of scouring the crocodile’s preferred mangrove
swamps and sandy beaches. But conservationists hope
recovery is a factor. .

. Like the endangered Florida panther, crocodiles
seem most at risk on the highway. Of 25 deaths investi-
gated from 1971 to 1984, 19were caused by man, in-
cluding 10 killed by vehicles. Elevated roadbeds, brid-

ges and culverts have been proposed to limit the
highway death rate.

Other crocodiles have been left little better off after
contact with humans. A crocodile was blinded in one
eye by a gunshot early this year on Plantation Key.
Nursed back to health, it was moved this month to an
exhibit at Theater by the Sea on a nearby key.

“I try to maintain that when we live in the Keys,
that we should learn to live with certain species, of
wildlife that have been here for numerous years,” en-
forcement officer Lawrence said. “If we build a home
in their back yard, then we definitely should learn to

_ CQ’CXlSt-"

The crocodile once ranged
as far north as Tampa Bay on
the Gulf of Mexico and nested
on Miami Beach. But the intru-
sion of man pushed the shy rep-N
tile to the southern edge of the
Florida peninsula, breeding on-
ly at the park, the Crocodile Na-
tional Wildlife Sanctuary on

 

 




North Key Largo and 68 miles
of cooling-water canals on a
. 10,000-acre preserve at the Tur-
, key Point nuclear power plant
Mazzottl south of Miami.

Researchers believe the best way to protect croco-
diles is to preserve what remains of their coastal habi-
tat.

“At one point, there were 27 major developments on
the drawing board for upper Key Largo,” where croco-
diles breed on man-made canal banks, Lawrence said.
“Had they gone through, not only would the crocodile
be super-endangered and probably not survive that type
of development, but probably several other species
would not survive.”

At the park, where roughly 60 percent of the croco-
diles breed in their only natural setting, visitors have
been barred since 1980 from a crocodile sanctuary that
takes up perhaps 3 percent of the park, said Tolle.

Mazzotti and fellow crocodile researcher Paul Mol-
er of the state game commission believe crocodiles are
at least holding their own.

“The big problem is not crocodiles’ intolerance of

people so much as it is people’s intolerance of croc-
odiles,” said Moler, who concentrates his research ‘on
North Key Largo. “They remain vulnerable and may
always remain vulnerable because of the very limited
area that’s available to them.”

Researchers will have to count 60 nesting pairs be-
fore the federal government eases its protection of
crocodiles, but Mazzotti won’t even project when that’s
likely.

“We have documented the population has been at
least stable, so the outlook has been enhanced,” he
said. “The big picture is if we are able to protect the
remaining habitat in Florida, it will persist.”

statewide environmental and ani-
mal protection organization, and
the National Alliance for Animals
Education Fund, a national organi-
zation which educates animal pro-
tection advocates on issues of con-
cern.

Quack-Choc!

Ducks breed new ﬂu

Daffy as it may sound,
quacking may herald the
start of the ﬂu season.

Our ﬁne—feathered

Dr. Robert Webster, 3

viruses rest harmlessly in
the ducks’ digestive system
but can infect people who
come in contact with duck
feces.

The risk of that happen-
ing is relatively high in Asia,
Webster says, where bil-
lions of ducks dwell along—
side billions of people. That
helps explain why many ﬂu
strains have Asian origins.
But mundane ﬂu varieties
that strike closer to home
also can be traced to mi—
grating mallards, he says.

has found nearly 80% of
young ducks already in—
fected by various strains of
human ﬂu virus. “Lake

virtual inﬂuenza soup.

More alarming, says
Northwestern University
biochemist Robert Lamb, is
the chance that in ducks’
innards, genetic material
from human and avian ﬂu
viruses may recombine in a
novel form. It’s these types
of inﬂuenza that have pan-
demic—causing potential, he
says. Ducks probably
played a role in the Hong

potentially a giant leap for

The discovery could lead to

surgically and stitched the
animals back up. “I didn’t

Afterward, Zasloff re-
turned the frogs to their

crobes abounded. To his
surprise, their wounds

The flashy collar Paddington Pug wore
was a $20,000 diamond-studded necklace.

Rosenberg says Paddington was
adorned with the sparkler last Thursday
at a photographer’s studio to pose for an
advertisement for Morgan & Co., the
Westwood Village jewelry store owned
by his master, Marcus Rosner. Everyone
figured that it was the break Paddington
. needed to become as famous as Spuds

But while all the human beings in the

door and made a break for it.

Rosenberg began calling animal
shelters and “all the government
agencies.” He says that his blood
pressure was “like 160 over 200” and that
he lost “about 10 years of life.”

Paddington’s freedom ended abruptly
when the Society for the Prevention of

without incident at Overland Avenue and

away, after a call from an alert citizen.

Lucky prairie dogs in Boulder captured, relocated

By Renate Robey
Denver Post Staff Writer

BOULDER — Progress comes,
the prairie dogs go. But the Boul-
der County Humane Society is
giving some lucky prairie dogs
some new digs, which are unlike-
ly to get paved over.

The animals have been forced
out of their current homes by
plans of the University of Colora-
do to begin building part of its
proposed 105-acre Research Park

' as early as next summer. About
35 acres of the proposed park is
heavily populated with prairie
dogs. Some of the area will be
open space, but another part will
be filled with research buildings.

“It’s one of my favorite prairie
dog towns,” said Sunny Apke,
who is in charge of the Humane
Society project. “I always get
stuck at that light at Foothills
Parkway and Arapahoe and the
prairie dogs are so entertaining.”

Since August, 73 prairie dogs
have been picked up, cleaned of
fleas and relocated. Apke will not
disclose their new home because
she fears prairie-dog haters may
do them harm.

Apke has a permit to move 150
prairie dogs but that still leaves
about 650 at the site. The city has
set up a committee to work on,
finding more sites on public lands
where the pups can be moved.

Apke is being assisted by a

Denver group, Prairie Dog Res-
cue, which has supplied most of
the 30 cages used to trap the ani-

_ mals.

The CU prairie dog proved to
be smarter than the average rac-
coon or skunk, animals common-
ly trapped by the Humane Soci-
ety. Apke, who is aided by
volunteers, got only three prairie
dogs during the first month. They

' The Denver Post / Jerry Cleveland

tried luring them with corn, pea-
nut butter, apples, brown sugar,
and granola; "the only thing they
attracted was ants. -

But as the weather cooled and
food became less abundant in the
prairie, the animals started going
into the cages.

Now Apke’s trick is a trail of
sweet corn leading to the cage
with an ear of corn inside it.

Apke said the animals do not
appear upset about being cap-
tured but they try to blend in as
much as possible in their cages.
They stay real low.. .They look
just like little lumps in there.”

Not all prairie dogs are so
lucky. A year ago, a number of
prairie dogs were poisoned at
Buckley Air National Guard Base
in Aurora. Buckley officials said
the animals were fed poisoned
oats because they posed a health
risk to pe0ple on the base.

In July, Pueblo officials discov-
ered that a sudden die-off of prai-
rie dogs had been caused by bu-
bonic plague.

Boulder officials have dusted
prairie—dog holes to protect
against ﬂeas and disease.

CU also is cooperating with ef-
forts to remove the animals be-
fore construction begins. “We
were delighted when they asked
us if they could relocate the prai-
rie dogs. We knew they were
there,” said Rick Porreca, assis—
tant to the vice chancellor for ad-
ministration.

The trapping will get more dif-
ficult in the coming months as "the
prairie dogs begin to go into semi-
hibernation.

But Apke said she will keep try-
ing: “If they can’t live where
they’ re living, then we should find
them someplace else.”

HOUNDED BY WOES,
MIAMIANS BEG FOR
MORE OF RYAN

THE ADVICE DOG

The intro to his column trumpets him
as The Most Widely Read Advice Dog
in America, and for once a journalist’s
bark is matched by his bite. Okay, so
he’s probably the onlycanine colum—
nist in the country, but even if Ryan the
Advice Dog—an 18—month-old black
and white Boston terrier—had compe-
tition, he would still be leading the
pack. Since August, Ryan’s column
has appeared each Friday in the Miami
News, offering the paper’s approxi-
mately 60,000 readers a unique brand
of personal guidance that might drive
Ann Landers absolutely bitchy. To
“Bored Silly,” a woman whose hus—
band “spends every weekend
sprawled snoring on the sofa,” Ryan
suggests treating him like a dog, i.e.,
“Pop him sharply several times on the
behind with a rolled-up newspaper.” ~
To “Furious Wife,” who caught her
middle—aged spouse “practically paw-
ing a 22-year-old woman,” Ryan re-
plies, “Have you considered putting in
a chain link fence?” Not that his own
kind is ignored: Ryan devoted nearly a
whole column to Miami’s best singles
spots (mostly back alleys) for pooches.

How does a dog get his own column?
Nepotism. Ryan lives in Key Biscayne
with John Keasler, 66, a Miami News
columnist. “l was damn sick and tired
of writing five times a week,” says
Keasler, who turned his Friday slot
over to his hound. Keasler and his wife,
Margery, a free-lance book editor, in-
sist they give Ryan no help, except
with his spelling. “He’s a lousy speller,”
says Keasler. “Like many fine writers,
detail work is not his forte.”

Attracting a following is. Response
to Ryan has been so favorable that
some readers want his column to run
every day. “But running him once a
week is all I can handle,” says Miami
News editor Howard Kleinberg. “I’m
getting calls from possums and pigs
who want columns. We can’t go on this
way.” Ryan has also inspired envy
among his own animal family. “He’s
talked to dogs who think they’d be
great writers,” Keasler says deadpan,
“if only they could get it on paper.” El Besides the column, says Keasler, Ryan Is “working on a novel, of course.”

Strickland cat shelter 00 full

State inspectors issue warnings on u _' 

By Katherine Corcoran
Denver Post Staff Writer

Lu Anne Strickland and her cat shelter are
in troubleagain.

Less than a year after fire ravaged her
last shelter, killing more than 100 cats, state
inspectors have told the longtime cat lover
and wife of Republican state Sen. Ted Strick-

land to cut the number of felines —— 79 by her

count, 207 by theirs —- to 50 and to get them
better veterinary care. ’

At least 50 cats have upper respiratory dis-
ease and many have stress-induced diarrhea
because of overcrowded conditions in a
small red house, which is attached to a feed
store at 7851 Indiana St., inspectors said
Thursday. ,

There’s no record—keeping on the animals,
no ventilation, feces on the walls, flies, and
lots of shag carpeting, probably the most un-
sanitary of floor coverings. Feed and water-
ing bowls are too big and cats are too afraid
to move around, said Dr. Rob Hilsenroth, a
Wheat Ridge veterinarian called in by the

state Department of Agriculture to evaluate

theshelter.

“Do you all hate me?” asked Strickland,

who has names for all 200 or so cats. “No one
has said anything about how nice it looks or
what good things I’m doing.” “i"
_ H 1lsenroth said the state also plans to
make surprise visits to make sure she is
complying with their recommendations. As
long as she does, they won’t issue a cease
and desist order or confiscate anigyals.

The Agriculture Departmen only re-
sponds to animal cruelty complaints, though
inspectors noted the house is grossly out of
line with Health Department regulations
“What are we going to say? Burn the place
down?” asked Steve Horn, deputy agricul-
ture commissioner.

The state received a cruelty complaint
last month from Betsy Tennyson, a Golden
resident who first saw Strickland’s shelter
when dropping off a stray cat.

Tennyson questioned Thursday why it took
the Agriculture Department a month to in-

ealt y conditions

spect Strickland’s operation and accused
them of “tiptoeing through the back door.
because she’s Sen. Strickland’ 5 wife.”

Horn said Ted Strickland was contacted
on "the matter only when Lu Anne couldn’t be
reached.

“The senator told us when we told him of
the situation, ‘Do your jobs,’ ” Horn said.
“The“Department of Agriculture is not drag-
ging its feet because of political implica-
tions.”

Strickland’s landlord of the h0u§e in unin-
corporated Jefferson County has asked for a
zoning change so Strickland can rate a
shelter. In the meantime, she is coggered a
private resident and is technicallyiimited to

avmg three cats.

She will apply for the proper Health De-
partment permits after the zoning is
changed, she said.

“Kindness has to start somewhere,” said
Strickland, adding that state inspectors gave
her a lot to think about. “I know people think
I’m a little weird, but I’m a kind person.”

Wild animals get first— rate first aid

100 Georgians licensed
to provide private care

By Sandra McIntosh
Staff Writer

When the headlights of the van that
Steve Leach was riding in picked up the
brown mass in the center of the road, it
looked like just another loser in the daily
battle of animal versus automobile.

But the Lilburn man —- one of about

110 state-approved animal good Samari-
tans - recognized it instantly.

“I told my friend to pull over, that it
was a barred owl,” said Leach. He rescued
the crumpled bird, placing it in his jacket
until he could find a box large enough for
the owl. After several days in the box, giv-
ing it time to regain its senses, the owl
was released into the wild.

“It had just been stunned by ﬂying into
a car or truck, something that’s pretty
common for owls,” Leach said. “But if it
had stayed on that roadway, someone else

would have finished it off .”

That owl was extremely lucky Leach
happened by. He is one of a select group of
Georgians who hold permits allowing them
to care for injured wildlife, and only a few
specialize in raptors, or birds of prey such
as owls and hawks. .

Bob Monroe, a wildlife biologist with
the state Department of Natural Re-
sources, said the department depends on
people like Leach, who care for the ani-

mals without pay, because the state
has no facilities to care for injured
wildlife. _

Pe0ple who apply for a permit;
can ask to be specialists with 061*,
tain types of animals, Monroe said,
but must be able to show they have,
experience and the proper facilities
to care for them.

By state law, all native Georgia;
animals are protected and cannot?
be kept as pets, Monroe said. If the
animals can’t be rehabilitated and
returned to the wild, they must be
destroyed or turned over to a facili-
ty that uses them for educational

“W-

The Chattahoochee Nature Cen-
ter in Roswell has taken in injured
animals for years, although it has
cut back in the number it will
accept.

“At one time we were getting
3,000 a year, but we just don’t have
the staff, space or resources to do it
any more,” said Pat French, the an-
imal caretaker at the center.

A few animals, such as a blind
screech owl, a tame opossum, two
orphan chipmunks and a three-
legged‘ fox, are kept at the center so
the up to 400 children a day who at-
tend workshops there can see native
animals.

A few other injured animals —
a squirrel with balance problems, a
sparrow with an injured wing and a
screech owl with a swollen eye --
were recuperating in a back room
of the center this week.

“Often, when someone calls
about an injured animal, we’ll tell
them just to isolate the animal, pro-
tect it from predators and leave it

alone,” Mrs. French said. “If it’s a 1

baby, the mother will come back

for it. If it’s only slightly injured, it 1
will heal. If it’s really hurt, then we 5

try to refer them to someone else.”

None of those holding permits is ~

paid, and they often spend hundreds
of dollars and hours caring for the
animals, Monroe said. The volun-
teers usually do so out of love for
wildlife.

Leach said he has worked with
raptors since his college days and
has held a permit for 10 years,
treating as many as 40 birds a year.
Now, with two small children at
home, he handles about 18 to 20 a

ear with the help of his wife,
ren.

“The first thing you have to ac-
cept when dealing with raptors is
that you’re going to get hurt — it’s
inevitable,” Leach said, launching
into a litany of stories about punc-
ture wounds, claw marks and
gouges.

Humane Society
lmperatiVe For Us

I have been involved in animal wel-
. fare for the past eight years. Recently, as
g director and president of Adopt-A-Pet
. Inc., a non-profit organization, I was
forced to discontinue services due to fi-
nancial difficulties. Although the organi-1
nation is temporarily on hold, I am still
concerned about animals in my commu-
nity.

My concerns are for the Humane
ciety of Tampa Bay. The need for a iii:
mane society is imperative. Education
and public awareness are just as impor-
tant as pet adoption. The Humane Soci-
ety of Tampa Bay should be funded by
the city and county. It should not be
forced to close its doors. There has to be
an alternative organization where the
public can be assured the pet will be
adopted or humanely put to sleep.

Our city and county officials sho
uld
take immediate action to ' continue this

 

, worthy organization. Without a humane

society, I fear the worst is yet to come.

ANIMAL RIGHTS

Congratulations to Lawrence Wright
(“The Rights of Mice,” August). Al—
though I favor a signiﬁcant reduction in

minds me of the difﬁculty of any stand
one takes, with so many lives in the
balance.

It seems to me that the question of
vegetarianism is much clearer. Count—
less numbers of animals live in grossly
squalid and overcrowded conditions,
only to be slaughtered when their time
comes. I ﬁnd it ironic that this issue has
received so much less attention. than the
animal-rights issue.

ANGELES TIMES - November 7, 1987

Some say they are cute,

trained to use a cat box a
keep down the insect and

Explodes in LA.

By CAROL McGRAW, .
Times'Staff Writer

They prefer penthouse-like
living. They prowl at night. They
travel far in search of new dining
experiences, be it Mexican, Cajun
or vegetarian. They sport spiked
hairdos. Th y cart their kids
around in designer pouches.
They exercise their tails off.
They moved here from
somewhere else. And when
urban living gets to be too much,
th y suffer panic attacks.

Opossums, the quintessential
Southern Californians, have
taken well to city life, but it is just
this adaptability that has gotten
them into hot water. As their
population has soared
dramatically. the debate over
their right to a place in the urban
landscape has heated up.

The animals—which look like
they were put together by a mad
genetic scientist bent on creating
a super rat by crossing a well-fed
house cat with a pig—seem to
inspire either disgust or delight.

Some say they are cute, make
great house pets, can be trained
to use a cat box and keep down
the insect and rodent population.
Others label them nuisances that
get into garbage cans, eat the
pet’s food and carry ﬂeas that
transmit diseases such as marine
typhus. Still others say the only
good possum is a dead one,

preferably on a dinner plate.
(“They taste sort of like greasy
pork roast, " said one woman
whose friends used to serve them
at dinner parties in Louisiana.)
Complaints Generated

Regardless, the possum
population explosion has
generated complaints. concern
and misunderstanding, animal
control officials say. While some
municipalities have reminded
with massive eradication, the city
of Los Angeles has a relocation

program.

, “There are thousands. millions

of them out there.” said Tom
Walsh, the Los Angeles Animal
Control official who is in charge
of travel arrangements for
possums. He acknowledged that
he may be exaggerating, but not
by much.

They were first brought to
California from the Southern
states in the early 1900s. And
while there are no official possum
counts, everyone agrees that
they are proliferating, along with
some other wildlife such as

skunks, possibly because of mild .
weather and bountiful food
supplied in a variety of forms by
man.

The number of possums
captured by the city has
quadrupled over the last two
years. In the last four months
alone. 240 possums have been
picked up. Officers do not
purposely have a trapping
program for possums and

he
respond only when there are
complaints

Earlier this week, seven of the
creatures were scurrying around
their cages at the West
Chatsworth animal shelter
making strange clicking noises,
which some translate as possum
talk for extreme interest or
pleasure. However, the only
thing these animals have to look
forward to, Walsh said, is a
one-way ticket out of town via
helicopter.

The city’s wildlife relocation
, program also finds new homes' 1n
the Angeles National Forest for
deer, coyote, bobcats and
raccoons. More than 10,000
animals have been relocated
since the program began in 1970.

Some wildlife behaviorists
frown on the practice, believing
that relocation can upset the
balance of nature. “They have
their heart in the right place, but
the consequences can be
disastrous,” said Larry Sitton of
the state Deparment of Fish and
Game. “Sometimes when
populations get too big,
euthanasia unfortunately is the
only solution.”

Los Angeles County health
department officials see
opossums as a potential health
threat and frown on relocation
because infected animals may
spread disease. “Those that test
positive should be put down,”
said Frank Hall, the county’s
director of vector control. “We
comb them out all the time
during testing and they are
virtual fleabags.”

Limited testing has found

murine typhus in some pmms,
other wildlife and-pets in
Burbank, Mount Washington,
Eagle Rock, Pasadena, Silver
Lake, downtown and elsewhere. ‘
While the problem is not an
epidemic, there is a pownility
that possums can transmit the

, disease by way of fleas to house

pets, which in turn could infect
humans.

Little Danger Seen

But Los Angeles city officials
such as Walsh see little danger.
“The chances of being bitten are
pretty remote,” he said. There
have been no human deaths from
murine typhus in California.

. In Orange County, at the
request of individual
homeowners, euthanasia was
performed on nearly 4,000
possums that were trapped last
year. The death sentences were
ordered after an El Toro man
contracted murine typhus and an

, opossum captured in the vicinity

was thought to be the source.
The killings spurred some angry
residents to organize the
Opossum Society of California to
defend the animate

The society talked the county

' into conducting widespread tests

for the disease to see if the
animals really posed a threat.
Only three of 600 possums tested
positive, according to the Orange
County Vector Control District.
The death sentence was lifted in
August and animal control
officials now turn possum
complaints over to the society,
which relocates the offending
animal. “Man is too quick to kill

anything they don’t want or
understand. We took their

‘ habitat, not vice versa,” said Dr.

Anita Henness, a veterinarian
and founder of the society who
shares her home with six injured,
possums (all are house trained
and one likes to sleep on the bed ).

Opossum defenders believe « g ,_
that possums are unique animals : «a;

k that should be protected. For
. ‘ starters, they are the only North .

American marsupials—animals
that carry their young in a pouch
They are also the only

non -primate to have a thumb,
and feature rope- -like prehensile
tails which they use to swing on it
tree limbs. They are most well
known for playing possum—
dropping to ground, they roll
their eyes up, stick out their
tongue and emit a musky,
unpleasant death —like scent.

Because of their looks and that
trick—which works well with .
predators but not oncoming
cars—their IQ level is often
debated, said Michael Stokes, '
who has rescued several over the
years. ”They re pretty dumb. ” he
said bluntly but not unkindly. He
added that they are not a load of
fun. “They sleep all day, are
cranky when they wake up and
like to play this ‘I’m bad don’t
mess with me’ routine all the
time. They bare all 50 of those
awesome teeth and do a lot of
salivating. And they love to eat, ”
said Stokes, a technician at the ,
Los Angeles County Natural
History Museum. “They eat
anything that doesn’ t eat back at
a faster rate.”

~PALM BEACH (UPI) — On ev-

wealthy socialite Gertrude Maxwell
haas drummed up publicity to save

«Maxwell, 76, says superstitions
surnonnding the day known for pro-
voking bad luck discriminate
against cats who just happen to be
black.

.. a“Black cats are just as lonely as
anyxother animals,” Maxwell says.
‘llsfeei that because they’re discrim-

omthat’s stupid. Color has nothing
to de-with the value of life.”
QnFriday, Maxwell saved three
meek cats from the county’s

0‘ sweet,” she said.

she has also spent thousands of her
husband’s dollars.

“Every bit is worth it,” Maxwell
says. “No euthanasia. Any animal
who stays with me will never be put
down. That’s my creed.”

Every Monday, Maxwell prays a
“special prayer” for the animals of
Palm Beach County, about; 200 of
them weekly who will be put to
sleep. “It’s for those who have to
give up their lives,” she says.

And on every Friday the 13th,
Maxwell gathers some of her
friends, climbs into her new bronze
Rolls-Royce and drives across a
bridge separating the glitzy island
of Palm Beach from more down-to-
earth West Palm Beach.

At the Palm Beach County’s Ani-
mal Regulation Center Friday, Max-
well gathered up the cats and took

them to her own animal shelter, do-‘

hated by her husband, Mark, as a
50th wedding anniversary present.
Her husband, Maxwell says,
good-naturedly tolerates her love of
animals, but is not as emotional.
“He often answers our home
phone by saying ‘cat house,’ ” she
says. The couple met in Illinois,
where he helped her form the Gold-
man-Maxwell Animal Sanctuary in
Palatine, Ill.‘ That group, she says,

has saved 45,000 animals from
death.

Maxwell new plans to search for
pet owners who aren’t afraid of
black cats.

“It’s a deadline against time, a
constant deadline,” Maxwell says.
Her battle against theclock in-
cludes matching a rescued animal
with a suitable owner.

“She is a very, well-meaning
person who is often persistent” is all
shelter director Dennis Moore
wants to say about Maxwell.

Moore said neighbors living
near Maxwell’s personalshelter
filed a suit against her several
months ago because of the “nui-
sance” noise created by yapping
dogs. A judge ruled in Maxwell’s fa-
vor, deciding the issue was a civil
and not a criminal matter. ‘

“Some people think I’m crazy,”
Maxwell says. But she’s quick to
point out she holds two master’s de-
grees and was a former school
teacher and social worker.

Maxwell is constantly competing r
with the more’well-heeled charity,

the Animal Rescue League of Palm
Beach, for volunteers and charity
donations. ‘

Maxwell spends most of her
time attempting to match her res-

 

cued pets with the perfect owner.
Take the case of “Lolly,” the
black cat rescued by Maxwell Dec.
13, 1985. '
“It was one of those abandoned
animals, discarded and bashed up
against a wall,” she said. Maxwell

found the black creature at the

county control center, then took
him to Dr. Jeffrey Faivus, 45, a
Palm Beach veterinarian.

After months of extensive medi-
cal treatment, including surgery by
a Jupiter animal neurologist and at
least $1,500 in medical bills, “Lolly”
was nursed slowly back to health.

Global disaster lurks around the corner

if depletion of the ozone layer isn’t stopp

By Lewis Regenstein

Regenstein, author of “How to Survive in America
the Poisoned,” is vice president of The Fund for Animals.

Imagine a world in which many of our farming ar-
eas have dried up, making crop production impossible;

where the ocean’s marine life is dying off, and the sea no , 3;:

longer brings forth its bounty of fish and shellfish; a soci-
ety racked by illness and disability caused by epidemics
of dysfunctioning immune systems, skin cancers. cata-
racts, respiratory ailments and other diseases rampant.

This scene out of hell sounds like science fiction, but
it is a description of the world we are creating and soon
may begin to inherit, according to a growing consensus
of scientists and government officials dealing with at-
mospheric problems. ’

With the accelerating depletion of the Earth’s pro-
tective layer of ozone, and the warming of the atmos-
phere due to increased levels of carbon dioxide (the so-
called “greenhouse effect”), we are facing a serious
climatic crisis. The ultimate effects are unforeseeable
but potentially catastrophic.

The heat and drought of Georgia’s last two summers
may grow even more intense as such conditions become
a permanent feature of our summer season. As the polar
icecaps melt and sea levels rise over the coming decades,
coastal cities and settlements could be flooded and might
have to be abandoned.

Such scenarios sound alarmist and unreal, but when
the scientific projections are put in laymen’s terms, this
is what the experts fear may be coming.

In recent years, it has become all too apparent that
the planet’s protective layer of ozone gas, which makes
life on Earth possible by shielding us from the sun’s ul-
traviolet radiation, is being depleted at an alarming rate.
A hole the size of the United States now appears regular-
ly over Antarctica, containing only half the normal
amount of the gas. Overall, about 3 percent of the
world’s ozone layer is thought to have disappeared in the
last decade; the damage already done, and still being
done, may be permanent and irreversible.

The US. Environmental Protection Agency has pro-
jected that if current trends continue, the increase in ul-
traviolent radiation hitting the Earth will cause Ameri-
cans to suffer 40 million cases of skin cancer and 800,000
deaths in the next 88 years, plus 12 million eye cataracts.

More scientists who have studied the data now agree
that our ozone layer is vanishing largely because of an
increase in production and use of gases known as chloro-
fluonocarbons (CFCs), which are used in refrigerators,
air conditioning systems, foam insulation, food packaging
and in aerosols outside of the United States (where such
use is now largely banned).

There is hardly complete agreement among the ex-
rts about these facts; indeed, at this stage it is impossi-
le to predict precisely the effects of these atmospheric
changes, or to know exactly how and why they are occur-
ring. But Sen. George Mitchell (D—Maine), after co—chair—
ing congressional hearings on the subject, said that
“CFCs threaten the very ability of the planet Earth to
support life as we know it.”

Such warnings may be overly pessimistic, but can
we risk gambling our future when the stakes are so high?
As a Canadian government official working on the issue
put it, “We can’t afford to be wrong on this one. There’s
no rec“. cry, no turning hock."

For years. the Reagan administration has opposed

How this solution would be applied to saving crops, for—
ests, fisheries, and wildlife was not explained.

their use of CFCs by 10 percent a year for 10 years, and
the Soviet Union can complete CFC plants under con-
struction. ‘

It is projected that the plan would prevent an esti~
mated 130 million excess skin cancer cases that would
have occurred over the next century it the current rate
of increase continued. But even these reduced levels of
CFCs would allow an additional 2 percent loss of the
ozone layer in the next 70 years, causing some 7 million
excess cancers. It is estimated that each 1 percent de-
cline in high altitude ozone could cause 20,000 additional
cases of skin cancer just in the United States alone.

Fortunately, steps can be taken to address the prob
lem. A global tax on CFCs would discourage their use
and encourage the search for alternatives. Simple steps
such as redesigning automobile air conditioner seals and
valves to reduce leaks and using CFCs with shorter at-
mospheric life spans could effectively reduce CFCs lev-
els. We might even be able to live without plastic foam

containers for our fast food, if it meant saving the world. ,.

Thus, while disaster is not inevitable, it is getting

closer every day. Unless the government of the United .

States and other nations act quickly to force a drastic re-
duction in CFCs use, we may rer ,ger our world unlivable
—— for ourselves and future generationsﬁ

lE'I'TING CATS Oll'l' ‘
OF THE MB:
A CAUTIONARY TALE

Sunday, August 23, was not a good

day for .l. P. Dubey. That was the day

he discovered that 37 cats were miss-
ing from the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture ’8 Animal Parasitology Institute,
where he was conducting his research.
The intruders cut a chain link fence and
smashed padloCks to get into the build-
ing housing the cats, then apparently
made off with the animals in backpacks.
They spray-painted animal-rights slo-
gans on the walls and left behind vege-
tarian pamphlets and recipes—includ-
ing one for barley casserole.

Cycle of Infection:

(1) Infected cat excretes
oocysts (egglike form of par-
asite) into cat litter or soil. (2)
Oocysts in soil are eaten by
livestock; parasite infects ani-
mal tissues. (3) Humans ac-
quire parasite by handling
oocyst-containing cat litter or
soil, or by eating contaminated
meat. (4) Cycle repeats when other
cats acquire parasite by hunting and
eating small infected birds and mammals.

 

called the Band of Mercy claimed re-
sponsibility for the raid and released a
videotape of the animals. One frame
showed a small, startled kitten held aloft
by its liberator, a ﬁgure in a blue face
mask who looked more like a terrorist,
or Jason in Friday the I3zh , than a tender
angel of mercy.

The catnapping caused a ﬂurry of
publicity. But as a PR stunt for the ani-
mal-liberation movement it may have
backﬁred. When the USDA discovered
the theft, it issued an alert: 11 of the
stolen cats were infected with a parasite
that can cause birth defects in humans.

The parasite in question, Toxoplasma
gondii, had long been the focus of Du-
bey’s research. It is found in about 40
percent of the cats in this country. The

infection, called toxoplasmosis, rarely
causes symptoms in cats; but if a preg-
nant woman becomes infected, the re—
sults can be devastating for her child.
Many of the 3,000 or so infected chil-
dren born in the United States each year
suffer mental retardation or visual prob-
lems, according to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control (CDC). The disease is also
a threat to people with lowered immu-
nity, such as AIDS victims.

Though most warm-blooded mam-
mals are susceptible to the disease, cats
play a unique role in its transmission.
From the family pet to the Siberian tiger,
cats are the only animals known to pass
on the oocyst, or tiny egglike form, of
the parasite in their feces. Once depos-
ited in the soil, the oocysts spread to the
food and water sources of other animals,
including livestock. Humans can be-
come infected when they eat under-
cooked or raw meat contaminated with
the parasite. Or they can acquire the
parasite by inadvertently ingesting
oocysts, perhaps because they forgot to
wash their hands after changing cat litter
or after working in a yard where a cat has
defecated.

Researchers stress, however, that the
risk posed by cats should not be exagger-
ated. It’s believed that at any one time
only one percent of cats in the United
States are shedding oocysts. Still, Du-
bey points out that several million
oocysts can be shed by a single cat in one
day. And there are many unanswered

' ‘ questions. Is shedding a once-in-a-life-

Wildlife activists seek kangaroo import ban

FILE PHOTO/EVEN SIMO

They want to dry up market for skins
so Australia will tighten laws on killing

By Timothy Aeppel
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Washington

In Britain, eight running-shoe
manufacturers have stopped using
kangaroo leather in their products.

The European Community Par-
liament, meanwhile, slapped a par-
tial ban on the import of kangaroo
skins in September, and a bill in-
troduced in the United States Con-
gress calls for even more stringent
controls.

These eﬂorts reﬂect the grow-
ing push by a fervent coalition of
environmentalists and animal-
rights advocates against one of the
largest commercial wildlife har-

vests in the world.

Nearly 3 million kangaroos Will
be killed in Australia this year for
commercial uses. Others will be
hunted illegally or eliminated as
agricultural pests.

Australian ofﬁcials consider it
“culling” and say it is necessary.
They argue that kangaroos over-
populate many parts of the coun-
try and compete with cattle and
sheep for pasture -— points hotly
disputed by critics.

 

The killing of kangaroos has
long stirred controversy inside
Australia, where the marsupial is
a cherished national symbol. Ac-
tivists now want to make it an
international issue as well.

“The mainstay of the industry
is the export market,” says Lor-
raine Thorne, an organizer with
Greenpeace International based in
London. “So we believe the most
eﬁective approach is to make the
international community aware of
their involvement in the slaugh-
ter.”

Greenpeace is orchestrating the
international campaign, including
last year’s drive against running-
shoe companies. In that case, the
environmental lobbying group
wrote to ﬁrms in Britain, showing
them an advertisement that they
planned to produce naming shoe
companies that use kangaroo.

“[The ﬁrms] had an opportunity
to stop their name from being asso-
ciated with kangaroo skin, and
they took it,” says Ms. Thorne.
Indeed, four of the companies -
including Nike and New Balance —

have vowed to make their products “kan-
garoo free” worldwide.

A consumer campaign is also being pre-
pared for the US. In January, the Interna-
tional Wildlife Coalition based in Fal-
mouth, Mass, will publish a booklet
listing US companies that use kangaroo
skin in their products.

“Many products aren’t labeled “kanga-
roo skin,’ so it’s taking a lot of investiga-
tion on our part to pinpoint the items,”
says Marian Newman, the coalition’s

Australia earns about $10 million a
year from its kangaroo trade, most of it
from skins exported to Europe, North
America, and parts of Asia. The leather is
used in everything from handbags to
baseball gloves. A much smaller market
has developed for kangaroo meat, which
is sold as a delicacy in some parts of the
world.

John Clune, a spokesman for the Aus-
tralian Embassy in Washington, says,
“We just can’t accept the argument that
the larger species which are hunted com-
mercially are in any way endanger ” by

Anti-fur publicity grows - but sales in US are up, too ’

By Keith Henderson
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Boston

l'br ﬁve years Wim Dekok
and his colleagues have cam-
paigned against the sale of furs
in Holland. They’ve devised
anti-fur posters and songs carry-
ing such stinging messages as
“This is a secondhand coat -— the
ﬁrst owner is dead.”

And the campaign has paid
011', according to Mr. Dekok, a
tall, angular young man who

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR - November 10, 1987

for the Dutch Anti-fur Commit-
tee. Over the last three years, he
says, “admitted,” or open, sales
of furs have decreased by 80
percent in his country.

“At the moment,” adds
Dekok, “people in Holland don’t
buy fur anymore." The splashy
ads for furs in American news-
papers and magazines “look so
strange to me.”

On the other hand, in the
United States sales of furs have
risen sharply over recent years,

dustry, a trade organization. Re—
tail sales in 1986 were in the
neighborhood of $1.8 billion.
The industry attributes this to
greater interest in furs among
younger career women and
among men.

Dekok was in the US recently
to compare notes with activists
here. The goal, he says, is to
“orchestrate” his activities with
those of other anti-fur cam-
misma-

He notes that much of the

tic had centered on the use of
leg-hold traps to catch wild fur-

bearing animals. In fact, he con- '

tends, the central issue should
be the numerous fur farms or
ranches where mink, fox, and
other animals are raised for
their pelts.

Such farmsarefar fromelimi—
nated in Dekok’s own country.
Though the Dutch buy few fur
coats, “we have quite a huge
production of furs still in Hol-

land,” he says. By his as ’, .

some 300 fur farms operate there, with
most of their output going to export.
Worldwide, some 34 million pelts are
produced for fur clothing each year, ac-
cording to Bob Buckler, head of the Phir
Farm Animal Welfare Coalition, most of
whose members are US fur farmers. The
leading producer is the Soviet Union, fol-
lowed by Denmark, he says. The United
States produces 4.4 million pelts yearly.

Animals like the mink suﬂer far longer
in the cramped quarters of a farm than in
the jaws of a trap, according to Dekok.

“It’s hard to imagine the suﬁering of
those Wild animals in captivity,” he com-
ments. “They’re used to [being in] water,
or to roaming over ﬁve square miles."

Mr. Buckler, however, strongly dis-
putes allegations of cruelty.

“The fact is,” he contends, “mink have
been raised in domestic circumstances
since the 18603. . . . The mink industry is
a farm industry.”

”lb compare a farmed mink to a wild
one 13 like comparing a hog to a wild boar, '
in his view. '

Over many years, he explains, these
fur-bemng animals have been bred for
spec1ﬁc characteristics, such as pelt color

accordingtoAmericanIhirIn-

«L in~m.-ﬁ.&..L.-.._¢&a£L.-—&. ~MW .-

and litter size, jusr as other species have
been bred for qualities that enhance a
farmer’s production.

The size of the pens allow the animals
to move about, Buckler says. It’s in the
farmer’s interest, he continues, to “have
an environment that would leave the ani-
mals free from the stress that can hurt
pelt quality, as well as litter size.”

This debate boils down, perhaps, to
vastly diﬁerent views of how human be-
ings should treat animals. Animal-welfare
and animal-rights people like Dekok see
the fur industry as crassly sacriﬁcing
living beings to produce what many
people would consider an unnecessary
luxury.

Rick Parsons, executive director of the
Fur Retailers Information Council, on the
other hand, views anti-fur activists as
extremists who “hold as a belief that
mankind has no rights to use animals for
any purpose whatsoever.”

Dekok’s organization has distributed
posters proclaiming “Fur Farming Pro-
hibited,” and its efforts have been fea-
tured in TV news programs on the subject
in the Netherlands. Some broadcasts have
shown animals being electrocuted, a com

protest on this side of the Atlan-

mon method of killing on fur farms, ac-
cording to Dekok.

Buckler says the preferred method in i

the US is the use of pure carbon monoxide
gas. It’s no crueler, he says, than the
methods used by animal shelters to put
unwanted cats and dogs to “sleep.”

Concerning the success of the anti-fur
campaign in Holland versus that in the
US, Dekok observes, “In Holland, a small
country, it’s easier to get the message
across to the whole country.

“A lot of people say that Europeans, or
the Dutch anyway, have a different atti-
tude toward animals and toward social
welfare problems in general. But I don’t
feel you should say organizing an anti-fur
campaign is impossible here.” For one
thing, he says, the potential for raising
money and launching a campaign is much
greater here.

“We feel if we weren’t involved, fur
sales would be even higher,” comments
George Cave, director of Transpecies Un-
limited, a Pennsylvania-based animal-
rights group. His group has staged acts of
civil disobedience, such as sit-ins at stores
where furs are sold. It also massively
distributes leaﬂets to the public on high-
volume shopping days, like the day after
Thanksgiving. .

Composer Dennis Knick would be
flattered to hear that his music is fit for

composer writes personalized songs
about people’s pets. Although his

Labrador retriever named Goombay
and a polka dedicated to a Wisconsin

about a favorite tortoise has an appro—

means much more to me.”

“We always been a serious song-

because of the sinister cello music that

Braden. a graduate student in
wildlife biology at California State
UniverSity, San Bernardino, and
Glenn Stewart, a professor at Cali-
fornia State Polytechnic Universi-
ty, Pomona, have for months been
trapping and radiostagging the
bears to learn where they go, what
they eat and what they may need
to survive an uncertain future.

“I think if the world is going to
survive as we know it, we've got to
understand more about things out-
side the cities—the animals, the
vegetation.” Braden said.

“When it comes to bears. we
understand so little about their
ranges and habitat that we don’t
know what to protect and what to
leave alone.”

Of eight bears tagged and studied
so far, the den of only one has been
found. It belongs to Lazarus, a large
male named after the biblical char-
acter who rose from the dead.
Lazarus had not been expected to
survive the year because of a
crippling leg injury that left him
thin and near death in June.

“I was sure Lazarus was dying.
but then I spotted him again in
August, fat and healthy,” Braden
said. “What happened in between
is a mystery, but he earned his
name.”

Originally, the researchers cap-
tured and tagged six males and two
females, but a female and a male
have since been legally killed by
licensed hunters who claimed that
they did not notice the bears were
wearing radio collars and ear tags.

One of them, known as Kool
Fool, was cornered by hunting dogs
four weeks ago and shot to death as
it clung. terrified, to a tree.

Kool Fool, a 7-year-old, got his
name because his radio signal was
often so hard to detect that Braden
at one point suspected the bear of
“moving so smoothly that we
couldn’t pick him up.”

But on Oct. 18, Braden did pick
up the signal. on a radio frequency
allotted only to Kool Fool. As he
tracked the creature in Upper Big
Tujunga Canyon, Braden heard the
high-pitched yelping of hunting
dogs, then a blast of gunfire.

“It was a horrible thing to expe—
rience, and Ijust really let go when
I found the hunters," Braden said.
“I was screaming at them, and they
were very apologetic, but Kool
Fool was dead."

Mysteries Piling Up

In tracking the six collared bears
that remain, mysteries about these
complex animals are already piling
up. Although hibernation usually
does not begin for a few more
weeks. the researchers have found
that the male bears are disappear-
mg from the slopes early, for
unknown reasons.

In addition. Braden is not sure
how the bears have been finding
enough to eat. This year’s acorn
crop never appeared on the oak
trees, leaving the bears to forage
for old acorns on the ground,
manzanita berries and, occasional-
ly, smaller animals.

During hibernation, the bears eat
nothing and expel nothing. Groggy
and almost powerless against at-
tack, they live off fat built up
during a frenzied food-gathering
period in the summer and fall, and
recycle their body wastes back into
protein and usable water—a pro-
cess still not unraveled by science.

Stewart said that for the males.
hibernation is a solitary time, but
for females it is a time of giving
birth and nursing a family. usually
one or two cubs every few years.

Newborn bears are “tiny, hair-
less, blind, utterly helpless, and
have seldom been seen by man,”
Stewart said. Weighing less than a
pound, they could not survive
outside a den. Braden said they
look more like a “naked piglet"
than a bear, turning into fluffy
10-pounders by the time they
emerge in the spring.

In a rare sighting, Braden spot-
ted a mother and cub this year, and
watched in delight as the cob
“bounced out of the brush and onto
his mom’s back, really playful.
Then she sat down and nursed him,
and she began to walk and he
followed right behind her.”

Stewart and Braden said that
although as scientists they try to
remain aloof. some feelings of kn-
ship with the mischievous but
likable creatures are almost impos-
sible to avoid. ’

“Scientists aren’t supposed to get
attached, but I’ve named the ones
I’m tracking because they have
distinct personalities, like dogs. but

really more so,” Braden said. “You
can tell without checking their
collars who they are.”

Trash Man is one of Braden's
favorites—a clownish bear who is
easily recognizable at a distance
because of the bouncy spring in his
gait.

He's also the foremost glutton
when it comes to big dumpsters
filled with juicy garbage at many of
the campgrounds in the mountains.

“He has a certain style in a
dumpster," Braden said. “He'll
stand in the garbage, cross his front
arms lazily over the edge of the
dumps... and gaze around like
he's really happy.

“If the dominant bear, Einstein.
comes to the dumpster, all the
other bears wrll just leave, but
Trash Man only moves away a
little, then tries to sneak back up."

For all his gumption. Trash Man
“is near the bottom of the pecking
order." Ill the bear hierarchy, Bra-
den said.

Einstein. a 5-year—old, earned
his ironic name after Braden
watched him attempting to cross
the Angeles Crest Highway.

The first time Einstein stepped
onto the roadway, a vehicle ap-
peared and Einstein was nearly
struck. The unnerved animal wait--
ed several minutes. peering anx-
iously down the empty road. only
to venture back onto the pavement
in the path of a car approaching
from behind him. Visibly shaken.
Einstein made one last attempt, but
a truck appeared and narrowly
missed hitting him.

“He gave up and stayed on his
side of the highway," Braden said.
“I named him Einstein.”

While Einstein may be no genius
when it comes to the machinery of
humans, he commands respect as
the dominant bear in the group
under study.

Stewart said bears use low-key
threat gestures—a quiet “huff"
sound, and a chomping of the
jawbone. They also excel at subtle
facial gestures, such as the “dirty
look," Stewart. said. In the case of a
dominant bear, “one glance is real-
ly about all it takes to keep the
others in line.”

Bears also engage in the “bluff
charge.” in which they stamp their
feet and run toward their opponent.

because they expect to see humans.
Braden said.

But in the wild, the bears he has
met face to face have “looked me
over, then turned and walked
steadily away or ran, almost treat »
ing me like a dominant bear. The
ones who seem to know who I an.
might check me out for half a
minute or so, then turn away."

Nevertheless, bears can be dead-
ly. A male bear will kill and eat an}
cub—even its own—if the mother
fails to fend him off, and occasional
bear attacks on humans are report
ed throughout the United States.

Braden has spent much of the
last year in the forest alone. wan-x
dering the ravines and ridges of the
San Gabriels, mapping bear Sight-
ings to learn what kind of areas
they frequent, and studying their
fecal matter to determine their food
preferences.

He says he never completely
forgets that he is not really alone in
the forest, and reminds himself
never to look a bear directly in the
eyes—-an act of aggressron.

« Puppies
Support
Disabled

Just around Thanksgiving, about 24
special Labrador retriever puppies
will be born. Before they go into
training to become support dogs for
physically handicapped people, each
one will need a foster family for
about 13 to 15 months.

These puppies are a part of a pro-
gram sponsored by Support Dogs Inc.,
a non-profit organization with its
training center on Dogwood Lane in
Pevely. The program is the only one
of its kind in Missouri.

Founder and President Marilyn
Pona said last week when the puppies
become about 13 months old, they are
trained for six to nine months to pull
wheelchairs up ramps, open heavy
glass mall doors, pick dropped
crutches and do other unusual tasks.

They are then placed free of
charge with a physically handicapped
person.

“We build partners and friend-
ships,” said Pona while holding on to
Jocko —- her support dog which is a
Great Dane mix. “We have about 50
applicants waiting all over the nation,
but we can only do so much.”

Pona, who suffered a spinal and
joint defect several years ago, now
has neuromuscular degeneration that
left her in need of J ocko’s help.

“We teach these dogs to wait for
your instructions,” said Pona. “They
don’t just do things when they
decide.”

Trainer Mitzy Kirkbride and her
husband and Training Director .ierry
Kirkbride have dedicated their entire
lives to train dogs who provide such
help. .

They live in a two-bedroom ouse

Jocko giving Mariln Pona her cane after pick-
ing it up from the floor. Support Dogs Inc. is

pher and “a lot of pets.” A monthly
salary of $125, food stamps and com-
munity donations support the family.

“It’s hard at times,” said Mitzy
Kirkbride. “It’s a very taxing job —
both emotionally and physically, but
it’s very rewarding.”

Mitzy Kirkbride described the pup-
py training classes. After a foster
home is found, the parent comes to
regular classes to receive instructions
on deVeloping a proper personality
for the dogs.

“We teach the foster parents how

 

to live and deal with the growing
stages,” she said. “We look for fam-
ilies with kids or active families who
would expose the puppy to all sort of
situations.”

Kirkbride said that the Puppy Fos-
ter Care Program is a lot like rearing
a child.

“You want to get your kids up on
their feet and become responsible,”
she said. “You teach them to do some
good in this world, and when they
grow up, they leave to do just that.

“Some people (feel) hurt when

they return the dogs. But if they have
enjoyed this experience, we will re-
place the adult dog with a new
PUPPY."

Kirkbride said that the job’s re-
wards and joys take away the chance
of, ever considering another way of
life. ‘

"‘We see a lot of pain and heart-
aches in people with disability,” she
said. “But, we try to give them at least
a small amount of happiness.”

more than a "small amount" of
happiness.

Webster has muscular dystrophy
and is confined to an wheelchair.

”But. since I‘ve gotten Tune last
June. I‘ve become completely inde-
pendent." Webster said. “I've moved
out into my own apartment sinCe and
am now doing a lot of thing on my

“Before, I was active too. but al-
ways relying on other people," she

things by myself." '

Webster said that Tune has been a
great help in opening doors at the

University of Missouri —— St. Louis
where she studies psychology.

“Now. it's so much easier,“ she
said.

She found the organization in the
phone book one day. “by accident,”
she said. In November, 1986 she ap-
plied to participate in the training
program. Last June, she got her
“partner."

Her case was an unusually quick
one. she said. Normally, it takes long-
er to get a support dog.

“it‘s a long and strenuous process."
said Webster. “They (the organiza-
tion) were helping me and the dog
form a partnership.”

“For a while there, I thought we

weren’t going to make it, but they
were so supportive,” she continued.
“They are like a second family to me,
always there for any kind of help."

Pona explained that the organiza-
tion has a follow-up program that
first helps the two form a partner-
ship, and later makes sure the “rela-
tionship is working out."

Within the first three weeks. the
recipient is contacted by phone and
later visited. A yearly veterinary
checkup of the dog and a review of
the team is also provided.

People interested in providing a
foster home for the puppies or help-
ing in any other way should contact

Mother and I fell upon him and imprisoned him in
a straitjacket of towels. We perched him on a kitchen
stool With only his head protruding. Reba unwisely
chose this moment to take his face between her
thumb and forefinger and ask him how he enjoyed
his bath. He answered by biting clear through the
soft part of her hand.

The rest of the morning was taken up by the
blotting of water and blood, the applying of antisep-
tic and bandages, and the calming of Reba, who was
having hysterics.

And, Captain remained unclean.

. Never one to let a little thing like flesh wounds
interfere with her legitimate goals, mother applied
her brologist’s mind to a practical solution. To bathe
Captain, he would have to be restrained. The sight of
him wrapped in bath towels gave her an idea.

After she and Captain had both healed, mother
produced a mesh bag with a drawstring for closing
the opening. We would place Captain in the bag, she
explained, draw it closed around his neck, and knot
it securely. Thus confined, he could be immersed
and safely laundered. ' .

The plan went well until Captain felt the hated

water rising along his ﬂanks. With strength born of
panic, he hooked his claws into the mesh and tore
four great holes in the bag. He thrust out his legs,
climbed up mother’s right arm, and fled. We fol-
lowed a trail of water and tattered mesh to the top of
the piano, where he sat wet, angry and dirty in a
mesh tutu.

Undaunted, mother devised a plan to sheathe Cap-
tain’s dangerous fishhooks. She produced a set of
four little galoshes purchased from a pet store. They
were intended to protect a small dog’s paws from
mud or snow. “We’ll put them on Captain,” she
explained, “lace them tightly around his ankles, and
he won’t be able to scratch.” .

All was made ready again. The novelty even lured
my father and brother out of hiding. It’s not every
day that you get to see a real puss-in—boots.

Dropped into his tub, Captain came up ﬂailing. He
leaped into the air, shook his paws, and threw the
j four galOshes into the farthest corners of the room.
' Once more, he marched up poor mother’s bleeding
arms and escaped to the piano.

My father was moved to observed that gray was
not a bad color in a cat. And so the inevitable was
accepted and the bath banned. Captain lived to a ripe
old cat’s age and died in his sleep, Still slightly soiled.

Bathing tomcats
may be injurious
to your health

5 safety statisticians point out, there’s no
place like home for accidents. Bathroom
slips, kitchen burns, cutlery cuts, all take
their toll.

As do tomcats. ,

I know from personal experience that the bathing
of tomcats is a major cause of painful trauma suffered
in the home.

Contemplating a serene tomcat, you would never

suspect the true nature of the beast. A fully armed ‘

tomcat convinced of the immediacy of his demise in
a bathtub full of water would make Rambo sit up and
take notice. The reaction resides in the deepest re-
cesses of the feline psyche. Cat fanciers, you see,
understand that a tomcat has three types of glands:
dormitory, gustatory and amatory. Sans amatory
glands, the tomcat channels his energies into his two
remaining interests,'which are sleeping and eating.
But with or without amatory glands, a tomcat regards
a bath with the same savagery as a saber-toothed
tiger on a kill.

Even my childhood friend, the good-natured Cap‘
tain, plumbed the depths of uncool at the touch of
bathwater. This was unfortunate, because his long,
cottony coat would get progressively dingier, despite
hisdaily attention to it. And when it reached a tattle-
tale gray, my mother would frown and announce that
it was Time to Give Captain a Bath!

At these words, my father would become deeply
involved in sacrosanct “work.” My grandmother
would take to her bed. My younger brother would
simply vanish. Reba, the general factotum of our
household, would develop a sudden interest in the
preparation of dinner. _

That left me. And I knew what that meant.

What follows is a blow-by-blow description of
Captain’s first bath. '

Following instuctions, I ran six inches of tepid
water into the family tub. I put the flea soap into the
soap dish and piled several old towels close .to hand.

Mother went in search of Captain and found him
stretched out full length in a puddle of sunshine in
rapturous slumber. She gathered him up, and with
many strokes, both verbal and physical, brought him
unresisting to the bathroom.

The plan was that she would immerse Captain and
hold him in the water while I would lather and rinse
him. Together, we would wrap him in towels and pat
him dry. . .

Captain’s placid demeanor did not change until he
was lowered into the tub and felt the insidious water
creeping into his fur. His eyes grew round in alarm,
and he plunged like a broaching whale. But mother
was prepared and held on.

“The soap!” she cried.

______,..,__ .. ~

I went into action, sudsing Captain’s yellow coat
while he struggled and howled. Mother clutched him
fore and aft with a grip that was capable of making
me wince. But Captain wet was one thing; Captain
soapy was another. He eeled from her grasp, crawled
up her left arm as if it were a tree limb, and escaped.
He fled to the middle of the living room rug, where
he began shaking his leg to throw off the noxious
water

Liberty is answer
for injured birds

By Dong Frerichs
The Phoenix Gazette

SCOTTSDALE —— As the owl swooped
over the asphalt, it was caught by a
sudden wind-rush that slammed it
beneath the speeding belly of the car.

Steel clapped. Wings cracked. Spotted
feathers flew.

But miraculously, the short-eared owl
survived, was retrieved and taken by the
car’s driver to a veterinarian, who sent
the badly injured bird to the Liberty
Wildlife Rehabilitation Foundation.

Last Friday, the owl —— completely _
recovered from bruises and other injuries
—— was released during a Maricopa
County Audubon Society picnic near the
Gila River west of Phoenix.

It was another success for Liberty
Wildlife, a private non-profit
organization that owes its existence to
veterinarian Kathy Ingram and a score
of volunteers dedicated to saving injured
wild birds and returning them to the
wilds.

Based out of Ingram’s north Scottsdale
home, the foundation last year took in
898 wild birds for treatment and so for
this year has treated nearly 1,000 Wild
birds, said Megan Mosby, Ingram’s chief
assistant. .

“Basically, whatever people bring us
in the way of native wild birds, we take
care of. A lot of the birds are raptors ——
hawks, owls, eagles — or large birds like
vultures.

“We also take care of doves, quail,
roadrunners. We’ve even handled a
desert fox, a badger, squirrels, turtles,
snakes. If it’s non-native wildlife, we
have a list of veterinarians we can refer
people to,” Mosby said.

In a small annex off Ingram’s house, .
Mosby and Cathy Rickabaugh, a Phoenix
Zoo animal care specialist who donates
after-work hours to Liberty, readied

Bailey, a female turkey vulture, for an
exercise flight on a tether.

From small cubicles and cages came
screechings and flappings of numerous
complaining patients, including a
shriekish barn owl with a broken wing
and a yellow-bellied sapsucker.

Bailey lollygagged on a perch before
lackadaisically flapping her huge wings
in response to Rickabaugh’s summons.

On perches nearby sat Samantha, a
Harris hawk with an amputated wing,
and Acoma, a red-tail hawk who cannot
return to the wild because of being
“imprinted” at an early age by a
falconer. ,.

Imprinting, which refers to formation

of animal behavior, occurs when young
birds are removed from their natural
environment during developmental
periods when all their behavior is
learned and fixed, Mosby said.

If birds are exposed to humans during
such times, they become imprinted with
wrong responses and subsequently
cannot learn what they need to survive
in the wilds.

“They end up like Acoma or some of
our other birds. Mentally ill. Dingy. They
think they’re people instead of birds,”
Mosby said, adding that such birds are
kept by the foundation for use in public
educational programs.

Other birds that are kept as
“education birds” are crippled birds such
as Coolidge, a ferruginous hawk that lost
a wing during a run-in with an airplane,
and Igor, a great-horned owl that suffers
a deforming malady known as folding
fractures or bendy-bone.

The disease occurs when people
discover foundling birds or fledglings,
attempt to save them and feed them the
wrong foods, which leads to
malnutrition, improper bone growth and
crippling deformities, Mosby said.

In huge fl y-ways at the back of
Ingram’s yard, Mosby, who had been
joined by Ingram, pointed out scores of

recuperating hawks and owls that were
awaiting final testing before being
released.

“Before we can turn a hawk or owl
loose, we have to know they can survive.
If they’ve had wing injuries, eye or brain
injuries, we test them with live mice to
seedif they fly and make a kill,” Ingram
sai .

Among the cages, Rickabaugh was
arousing considerable ruckus as she fed

, the large raptors with dead pigeons

donated by pigeon breeders.

Such donations, coupled with
monetary contributions and funds raised
from rummage and T-shirt sales, keep
the foundation afloat, Ingram said.

“Our dream is to establish a nature
center that would also serve as a natural
history center —— a place in the desert
where we take care of birds, offer
programs, and where people and
children could come and learn,” she said.

“Of course, we’d need to get some
pretty huge donations or raise an awful
lot of funds before anything could be
done?’

The foundation is planning its annual
rummage sale and fund-raiser from 8
am. to 5 pm. Nov. 7-8 at Ingram’s house,
11825 N. 70th St. More information is

available by calling 998-5550.

Atlanta, Georgia 30345

Dear Connie:

Thank you for the letters you sent to me regarding animal
rights. I regret that a busy legislative schedule and a heavy
influx of mail prevented my responding earlier.

In the 99th Congress there were House of Representatives and
Senate Concurrent Resolutions expressing the sense of both houses
that the "Silver Spring Monkeys" be transferred from the National
Institutes of Health to Primarily Primates, Inc. in San Antonio,
Texas. Since the Senate bill was referred to the Committee on
Labor and Human Resources, of which I am not a member, and it was
not reported out of that committee, I never had the opportunity
to vote for the Senate measure. Currently in the House Energy
and Commerce Committee, there is another piece of legislation
requiring the transfer of the monkeys. Also in the House is a
bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act so that citizens can bring
suit to compel the enforcement of that Act.

Representative Charles E. Bennett has introduced the Veal
Calf Protection Act. If passed, this bill prohibits a person who
raises a calf used for veal production from keeping the calf in
an enclosure (other than for transportation or inoculation
purposes) that prevents normal postural adjustments or physical
contact with other calves; and feeding a calf food that does not
meet standards prescribed by the Secretary of Agriculture. It
would also make it unlawful for a person to knowingly transport,
sell or purchase a calf subjected to these prohibited practices.
A $5,000 per animal fine would be assessed for violation of these
restrictions. The Secretary of Agriculture would have to issue
rules with specified contents concerning calf food standards.

Any person who suffers or would suffer injury because of a
violation of this measure would be able to bring civil action to
either stop the violation or compel the government to support the
law.

The federal regulations for the Improved Standards for
Laboratory Animals Amendments to the Animal Welfare Act are not
yet completed. On March 31, 1987, draft regulations for Parts I
and II were released by the Department of Agriculture for
comments. The comment period ended on August 27 and the final
regulations should be forthcoming. Part III regulations will not
be released until regulations for Parts I and II are finalized.
At this time, the Senate Agriculture Committee is not planning
any action with regard to the implementation of these amendments.

The United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued
patents for microorganisms and plants but a patent has not been
issued for genetically altered animals. The Supreme Court has
ruled that living matter which owes its unique existence to human
intervention can be patented. Representative Charles Rose has
introduced a bill to amend title 35 of the United States Code to
prohibit the patenting of genetically altered or modified animals
for two years and revokes previously granted patents for such
animals.

The United States Forest Service is mandated to maintain the
national forests for everyone. Forests are managed not only for
timber removal but also for water use, recreation and wildlife.
Even though all these factors should be taken into account
equally, at times the balance becomes skewed and one resource may
be exploited more to the detriment of the others.

Coyotes, by their nature, are predators. They play a key
role in the ecological balance of their natural environment.
Unfortunately, they sometimes can cause great harm to livestock.
Predators born on federal land are protected from private
landowners, therefore predator control must be undertaken by the
federal government. I agree that the methods used should be
humane.

There is a large discrepancy between the amount charged to
graze cattle on private land and the amount charged for public
land. Although there is some subsidizing of prices, there are
also more restrictions placed on the owners of livestock who use
public land. One of the biggest differences is the quality of
the forage available. It usually takes more public land to feed
fewer cattle than on private land.

Senator Ford introduced 8. 1457, The Pet Protection Act, on
June 30, 1987. As you know, this measure would prohibit research
grants of the National Institutes of Health to any person using
laboratory animals acquired from animal shelters. The bill has
been referred to the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.

The Committee has requested executive comment from the Department
of Health and Human Resources. My position has always been that
I oppose the mistreatment of animals whether it occurs in

the privacy of someone's home, in a laboratory, or on a farm.

You have written letters regarding two bills originating in
the House of Representatives. H.R. 2724, the Refuge Wildlife
Act, has been referred to the House Committee on Merchant Marine
and Fisheries for review. If enacted, this measure would
prohibit hunting and trapping in the National Wildlife Refuge
System. A similar measure has yet to be introduced in the
Senate. The Plastic Pollution Research and Control Act,

H.R. 940, has completed the conference committee process between
the House and Senate. On October 20, 1987, the House of
Representatives passed the bill, as amended, and the bill is now
in the Senate Commerce Committee.

Hearings on the Tongass Timber Reform Act were held on
November 3 and 5 in the Senate Energy and and Natural Resources
Committee. It is expected that this legislation will reach the
Senate floor during the second session of the 100th Congress.

In regard to the killing of sea turtles, please refer to my
letter of November 19 which discusses the reauthorization of the
Endangered Species Act which covers the sea turtle.

Connie, your diligence and concern for environmental issues
is to be admired, and, as always, I appreciate the benefit of
your advice. You may be assured that if or when any of the
matters discussed in this letter come before the full Senate, I
will keep your concerns in mind.

Sincerely,

H“ V

HOUSTON POST - December 9, 1987

Mandatory insurance

express outrage

By Leslie Loddeke

 

OF THE HOUSTON POST

Houston pit bull proponents
Tuesday attacked a proposal to
require pit bull and chow owners
to obtain $100,000 in liability in-
surance, calling such an ordi-
nance discriminatory and unen-
forceable.

“The whole thing is just a
smoke screen,” said Sara Nugent,
president of the state American
Staffordshire Terrier Club and a
director of the Houston Pit Bull
Club. “There is no such insurance
offered anywhere -— you can’t
get it. It’s just a sneaky way of
saying you can’t have them.”

Nugent was angered to hear
that Houston’s top animal control
officer wants the city to adopt an
ordinance requiring the insurance

. as well as muzzles when the dogs

.4

leave the owners’ property. There

. have been nine pit bull attacks in

Houston since October 1985. Pit
bulls caused 21 of 29 mauling
deaths since 1983 nationwide.
The pit bull is being singled out
because “the media has pounded
into people’s heads that they are
the meanest,” said Nugent. Due
to the publicity, she said, the
“wrong people” have acquired
pit bulls. Chows are not always
friendly, but “there’s nothing
wrong” with either dog, she said.
Nugent said it would be impos-
sible for animal control officials to
correctly identify a pit bull be-
cause “no test can be done to
establish a dog is a certain
breed.” A breeder, obedience

trainer and show judge for 23
years, Nugent said it was a mis-
take to single out pit bulls and
chows.

Houston attorney Jack Zim~
mermann cited at least 18 states
in which cities now have ordi-
nances targeting pit bulls or vi-
cious dogs in general.

“It’s the people, not the dogs,”
said San Leon truck driver Mi-
chael William Pickett, a pit bull
dog owner. Machinist W.K. Gor-
man, who owns two pit bulls, said
the proposal wasn’t fair because
he and others couldn’t afford the
insurance.

“And I’m not going to get rid
of my dogs, either,” he said.

An extra $100,000 coverage
would add only about $10—$15 to
the premium for a total $300,000
homeowners’ liability insurance
contract, said State Farm Insur-
ance Co. spokesman Dave
Hearst. However, “insurance
companies are very careful about
the kinds of dogs they want to
insure,” he said. “Having a pit
bull could cause problems, there’s
no doubt about that.”

In Austin, State Board of Insur-
ance spokesman Lee Jones said
such special coverage would have
to be approved by the board ——
“if you could get anybody to
write it.”

Raylene Smith, who still needs
plastic surgery after pit bulls tore
chunks out of her legs and arms
two years ago, said she believed
the proposal was “a step in the
right direction, but I’m not sure if
it’s wise to be breed-specific.”

:FOr.PetAmdoptions, an Unusual HolidaySetting

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 9 (AP) -—
Elaborate Christmas windows are a
tradition at the specialty store
Gump’s, but this year the windows
are filled with dogs and cats. .

The store, which dates to 1861,
turned its windows over to the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals, and the windows now offer ani-
mals for adoption.

“The animals are usually gone by
the end of the day,” William Goulet,
Gump's vice president, said this
week. “Fifty-nine have been adopted
since this started seven days ago, in-
cluding a bunny.”

The prospective pets go for the
standard S.P.C.A. fee - $19.20 for
dogs and $18.20 for cats, which in-
cludes license or registration and a

$10 deposit that will be returned if the .

animal is neutered.

Behind the glass, the animals live
in air-conditioned display areas that
have the usual Yuletide decorations
of evergreens and red ribbons. How-
ever, each room has a different
theme: a circus, an attic nursery, a
parlor, a Victorian house, a toy store
and a forest. ’ . ,

“It cost $12,000 for the air-condi-
tioning, and each room has a thermo-
stat,” Mr. Goulet said. ,

On a recent day a terrier slept con-
tentediy between two trees in the for-
est display. A cat snoozed in the nurs-
ery, while her kittens played nearby.

The idea for the display came from
Robert Leitstein, Gump’s president.
Inside the store, where the offerings

 

NEW YORK TIMES - December 10, 1987

include candlesticks for $125, doll
houses for $500 and a famed collec-
tion of French crystal, is a. booth
staffed by S.P.C.A. members, who in-
terview potential pet adopters.

"This is just wonderful," said Mark
Weiss, adoption coordinator for the
society. “This really unique approach
has been especially helpful in letting
us place some animals that had diffi—
culty with the usual adoption route.”

Mr. Weiss, who wore a Santa Claus
hat, said a poodle that had been “ex-
tremely shy” in the society’s facili-
ties “really showed personality” in
the display windows.

“There weren’t any major prob-
lems,” said Bob Mahoney, who de-
signed the windows. “1 hope it
catches on in other cities.”

Dogs are walked regularly and a
veterinarian is on hand, should any
health problems arise. “There’s also
an animal psychologist, but the cor-
rect term is animal behaviorist,” said
Mr. Goulet.

However, there has been no indica-

tion of any mental health problems, '

he added. Besides, he has a sure way
of measuring happiness on both sides
of the window: he counts the nose
prints on the glass.

‘ommittee: Abolish animal

By Scott R. Akin
riaignbor Staff Writer

DeKalb Animal Control will no
longer have to report to the Animal
Control Advisory Board if the Com-
mission approves abolishing the
advisory board, as recommended by
the special committee studying
DeKaib animal control.

The three county commissioners
on the animal control committee
met for the first time Dec. 2 with
DeKaib Public Safety Director F‘J.
Hand, animal control officials and
representatives of DeKaib animal
shelter support groups.

“It was just the organizational
meeting, but the one thing we all
agreed on was to recommend
.ioolishing the advisory board,” said
tl’fommissioner Robert Morris. who
chairs the committee. “We felt like,
abolishing the advisory board would
he like clearing the decks for the
recommendations we’ll make later

on," he said. i ‘ '

On Nov. 10, the DeKalb Board of
commissioners tabled a roposed
amendment to the animal control
ordinance that would have abolished
the advisory board and made the
animal .control director solely re-
sponsible for the disposition of
imgounded animals.

ounty Commissioner Sherry
Schulman, who earlier op .ed
county donations of pound an mals
to universities for medical research,
said she prefers the committee’s
plan for abolishing the animal
control advisory board over the
tabled motion consider-ed by the
county board.

“The. difference is (the commit.
tee’s recommendation) won’t givs
animal control's director authority
for disposing of _ and animals.’
Ms. Schulman sai .

The animal control committee
will be researching means for more

is responsible for enforcing the

animal shelter two different depart-
ments, Morris said.

The committee will also look into
the new animal shelter.

in 1984, $500,000 was ap-
propriated, “almost arbitrarily,”
for a new shelter, Ms. Schulman
said.

three years later the architac~
tural designs were finished and the
plans were recently submitted call~
log for the expenditure of $1.9
million. The county staff has since
returned the design to the architects
for reevaluation and modifications.

About $450,000 is still allocated for
a new animal shelter, but not the
millions of dollars needed to build a
new shelter.

“I’d love to do it if we have the
wherewithal to do it, but you just
oan’t do everything," Morris said.
Morris added that a new shelter

would solve a number of problems.
such as disease due to poor shelter
conditions.

In the meantime. groups such as
the DeKalb Animal Auxiliary are
recommending the shelter keep
animals only three days before
disposing of. them. Morris said. The
briefer period would prevent the
animals’ suffering from diseases

Committee participants said they
were pleased with the initial meet-

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - December 1, 1987

~ Ravenous Bears Gorging

Asscmiated Press

Concord, NH

A shortage of beecl‘muts
and acorns, the food of‘choice of
New Hampshire’s black bears, is
driving the bruins to ruin apple
orchards and cornfields in terri-
tory more peopled than their
: usual mountain terrain.

“The bears were raising hell
with silage corn in October,” Agri-
culture Commissioner Stephen Tay-
lor said. “Now they‘re going after
the apples. Good thing they’re going
into hibernation soon.”

_ Nuts of the beech and acorns of
the oak have cyclical years of good
and bad crops “and this has not
been a good year," says John iitva‘t
tis. professor of wildlife ecology at
' the University of New Hampshire.

Litvaitis and two graduate stu-
dents, Douglas Kane and Kathleen
Meddleton, have been tracking
bears around the state to determine
their habits, including the autumn
gorging that readies them for win-

ter hibernation.

Beech and oak, Litvaitis says.
“are upland trees and when there‘s
no food, the bears start coming
down from their ridges in the White
Mountains and start looking for
food.”

The bears' bad luck has been
the hunters’ good fortune, with the
season‘s bear kill almost twice what
it was last year, especially in the hot
spots around the cornfields of the
upper Connecticut River valley and

the Conway area.

Bear hunters think in terms of
“a nut year and an appie year,” says
Howard Nowell, a game manage-
ment expert with the statesFish and
Game Department, who says 262
bears were taken this year, compar-
ed with 148 in the previous year.

Nowell has high praise “for the

sportsmen who listened to us" when

the department, concerned about

the heavy kill, asked hunters to
Slack off in stalking bear and the

kill dropped significantly.

Roaming bears can be good

luck for a hunter, but they are a '

damaging nuisance for farmers and
orchardists.

Rob Calvert of the federal Fish
and Wildlife Service’s game dam-

on Apples '2

age control division says that once
the bears leave their ridges they
begin to edge around civilization,
foraging in fields of silage corn and
apple orchards.

The damage to the corn usually 3
is not discovered until harvest time, ‘
when the farmer cuts into the wast-
ed field.

“Being secretive animals, the
bears don’t go to the edge of the
field but inside it, rake up a pile
about 20 feet b3 EU feet and like the
Romans they gorge themselves and
regurgitate a lot of the food,” Cal-
vert says.

. ., Bears range in size from 150
pounds for females and 500 pounds
for males and several foraging bru—
ins “can take a couple of acres out,”
Calvert says.

The difference, Barbee said, is that
bear aggression in the wild is natural
and even acceptable behavior, but
repeated aggression in developed areas
is a sign the bear has become habituated
to civilization and poses an unaccep-
table threat to humans.

He said there also is a liability prob-
lem associated with habituated bears
because, even though park visitors are
warned of the dangers associated with
all wildlife, victims or families of victims
have filed lawsuits following grizzly
attacks and bison gorings.

As for the two-year-old cub that was
separated from bear 83 before the last
attempt to re-locate her, Servheen said
it had been radio collared and was being
tracked.

At last report, it was still in the vic-
inity of Yellowstone Lake, but had made
no effort to return to any pOpulated
area. He estimated the cub had a good
chance to make it alone.

”We’ve separated yearling cubs from
their mothers and had them survive,”
Servheen said.

TAMPA TRIBUNE—TIMES - December 6, 1987

SAN DIEGO (UPI) — Sea
World, the popular marine park
that has been a high-profile money-

.maker for book publisher Harcourt

Brace Jovanovich, is reeling in a bi-
zarre storm of bad publicity and in-
ternal shakeups over trainer and
animal welfare.

A rash of accidents in which
performing killer whales injured
their trainers, a report of unusually
high death rates among whales and
dolphins at the park and the subse-
quent dismissal 0f three top officials
have marred an otherwise banner
year at the aquarium. Performing
killer whales are featured at all
three Sea World aquatic parks in
San Diego, Orlando and Cleveland.
The company is based in Orlando.

After months of touting this sum-
mer’s record high attendance, HBJ
has fired Sea World’s president, the
zoological director and the chief
trainer.

After an accident last month in
which a trainer was crushed be-
tween two killer whales in front of a
packed stadium at the San Diego

,park, the company announced its

trainers at all three parks would no

‘ plague Calif. Sea World

longer enter the water with the ani-
mals during performances.

While publisher William Jova-
novich is refusing all requests for
interviews, a number of former and
current San Diego Sea World em-

.ployees, many speaking anonymous-

ly, blame HBJ directly for what
they say has been a tragic emphasis
on entertainment over marine sci-
ence. ‘ ' 4

Inexperienced trainers and inef-
fective training methods “that
looked good to the public” resulted
in erratic whale behavior and even-
tually helped cause a series of train-
er injuries during whale
performances, said Arthur “Bud”
Krames, who worked at San Diego
Sea World for 12 years.

This year, three trainers suf-
fered neck injuries during mishaps
at the San Diego park and a fourth
sustained internal injuries when two
whales tossed him around, accord-
ing to Sea World sources quoted
earlier this month by San Diego’s
KCST—TV.

The string of California acci-.

 

t

 

dents culminated Nov. 21 When Or-
ky, a killer whale Sea World
obtained when it took over nearby
= Marineland, leaped onto trainer
' John Sillick as .he rode a second
whale during a routine stunt before
a full house.

Sillick was hospitalized in the in-
tensive care unit of the University
of California, San'Diego, Medical
Center with a broken pelvis, ribs
and upper leg.

“The biggest contributing factor
has been the inexperience of new
trainers,” Krames said. These were
hired “right off the streets” after up
to 95 percent of the park’s trainers,

including Krames, left when highly ,

permissive show handling methods
were introduced around 1984.

' “Since then, you’ve had trainers
with two weeks’ to two years’ expe-
rience working with whales who
have eight to 20 years’ experience,”
Krames said. “Who do you think
will have the upper hand in that sit-

uaﬁon?”

Krames and other sources said
J ovanovich was warned repeatedly
that Sea World trainers were risking
injury during a heavy schedule of
aquatic shows with the killer
whales.

The crowd-pleasing shows at San
Diego’s Shamu Stadium, a 6-mil-
lion-gallon whale pool that opened
May 30, have been a key factor in
setting new attendance records at
the park. '

A Sea World statement Dec. 2
said, “Trainers will no longer enter
the pools with animals” during per-
formances, and aDec. 4 announce-
ment trumpeted plans for “the
expansion of Shamu Stadium” in
San Diego, including a $3-million
video screen. '

But Jovanovich would not re- ,

spond to the charges of whale mis-
management. Nor would he
comment on a study showing surviv-
al rates for whales and dolphins at

Sea World were three times worse .

than for the same species in captivi-

ty at other U.S. zoos and aquariums.

David Bain of the University of

' California at Santa Cruz told the

Minneapolis Star-Tribune Nov. 30
that Sea World, which has the
world’s largest collection of marine
mammals, reported at least 132
whale and dolphin deaths since
1973.

“Something in their medical
care system is breaking down,” said
Bain, adding: “They’re the biggest
-— they are not the best. The ani-
mals are dying.”

The flurry of bad news about
Sea World was no surprise to Ted
Crail of the Animal Protection Insti-
tute in Sacramento, who said the
park really courted trouble when it
bought Marineland in Rancho Palos
Verde, Calif, this year, moved two
killer whales there to the San Diego
facility and then closed down the
Los Angeles-area aquatic park.

The Sea World parks brought in
$40 million in 1986, more than 25
percent of HBJ’s profits.

A fourth Sea World park is
scheduled to open next year in San
Antonio, Texas.

 




 

JACKSON HOLE (WYOMING) GUIDE - Nox ember 18,1987

Park defends l<1ll1ng bear ~
pledges restraint in future

By Jean lieller
1 Staff Writer

The superintendent of Yellowstone
National Park says unless there is a
direct threat to human life, there will
be no further attempts to shoot problem

grizzly bears, although such animals .

will be “removed" from the population
by other means.

Robert Barbee was in Jackson Thurs-
day with Deputy Superintendent Ben
Clary and Chris Servheen, coordinator
of the interagency grizzly bear recovery
program, to explain the reasons for kil-
ling bear No. 83 earlier this month.

They said the decision to destroy
No. 83 was made more than a year ago,
but like other problem bears in the park,
she was given several more chances
to reform than are called for under
grizzly management guidelines.

”We give them all extra chances,”

Servheen said.
. The final attempt came just days
‘ before she was killed when she was
moved 15 miles from the Canyon area
, where she had been causing problems.

”We hoped she wouldn’t come back,

but she did,” Servheen said. ”I’ve seen
bears moved 100 miles that try to come
back. I don’t think we can move them
far enough given the space we have
left for bears in this country.”

Barbee and Servheen reacted vehe—
mently in denying allegations that the
National Park Service has a ”hit list”
of Yellowstone grizzlies targeted for
destruction.

They also refused to second guess
rangers in the ﬁeld who were respon—
sible for the unsuccessful attempt to
shoot No. 83 two days before she was
captured and electrocuted.

And they defended the killing of the
bear despite the actions of Jackson attor-
ney Robert Schuster, who called the
park several hours before the sow's
death to say he was seeking a temporary
restraining order to save her life.

"We didn’t view that favorably,”
Servheen said. ”If we held it, we’d have
to feed it, and then the bear would be
conditioned, and we could never release
it again.”

But Barbee conceded that the entire
incident could have been better
handled.

 

”It doesn’t look too good to shoot
a bear off a carcass, does it?” he said.

i ”It was not our finest hour.”

The reference was to a failed attempt

f to bring down No. 83 with a high-

powered rifle as she stood over an elk
carcass. For unknown reasons, the sin-
gle shot fired by a ranger fell short of
the bear, skipping off the ground and
nicking her paw.

Barbee said she was not seriously
wounded.

”She was back over the carcass an
hour later," he said.

He added that measures are being
developed to strengthen procedures
regarding handling and disposition
of problem bears. The new policy would

apply only to Yellowstone’ s grizzlies,
not to bears living in any other federal
jurisdiction.

Among those measures, Barbee said,
was a policy that ﬁrearms be used only
when there is a clear threat to human
life, that in the future, only specially
trained personnel be used to deal with
problem bears, and a new decision—
review policy be developed.

Barbee, Clary and Servheen met ﬁrst
on Thursday afternoon with a group
of local biologists and conservationists
to discuss the decisions which were
made in connection with bear 83.

They met later with Schuster and '

Hank Phibbs, also a Jackson lawyer
and the immediate past president of
the Greater Yellowstone Coalition.

After the second meeting, Phibbs
said the guidelines under which the
decision was made to destroy bear 83
provided ”a very few people with unbe-
lievably broad discretion, free of the
threat of any public review of their
decisions.”

”Once they decide that a bear has

to go, it’s done within 24 hours,” Phibbs .

said. ”They say that’s the way they
have to do it because it would be inhu—
mane to keep them in a cage for a week

And they say that feeding the bears '

during that period of captivity would
habituate them to food.”

”That’s totally beside the point. These
are bears which, by deﬁnition, are hab-
ituated already. That’s why they’re in
trouble. And to say you can’t feed them

 

to Yellowstone’s problem grizzlies.

in such away that they don’t recognize
a human benefactor is ludicrous. It’s
done in zoos all the time.”

Phibbs said he also remained con-
vinced that the federal and state agen-
cies which make up the Interagency
Grizzly Bear Committee do, in fact, have
a “hit list” of problem bears in the park
"which are targeted for termination.”

”I don’t back off that term one bit,”
he said. ”They acknowledge that they
have dossiers on all the problem bears.
They say they have a list, but it isn’t ,
a hit list. They just don’ t like that term, .
but that’ 5 their hang— —up.”

”I say if it walks like a duck and talks
like a duck and is covered with duck
down, you can call it a giraffe if you
want, but it’s a duck to me.”

Phibbs added that he knows people
who claim to have heard lGBC members
themselves use ”hit-list” in referring

 

Among those at Thursday’s first
meeting were Len Carlman, public
lands coordinator of the Jackson Hole

Alliance for Responsible Planning,
former National Park Service officials

 

graphers Franz Camenzind and Tom
Mangelsen, John Barlow, president of
the Wyoming Outdoor Council and
Scott Berkenfield of the Sierra Club.

The majority of those at the early
meeting agreed that bear 83’s history
of aggressive behavior toward humans
in Yellowstone’s Canyon and Lake areas
was sufficient justification for her
destruction.

They expressed concerns, however,
that it might become park policy to
destroy any bear which becomes
aggressive toward humans, regardless
of the provocation. Barbee said that .
was absolutely not the case. .

”If a guy goes into the back country
and gets nailed, there is no action what-
soever taken against the bear,” he said.
”We don’t even try to find out what

 

, bear was responsible. Our policy is,
T if you’re in the bear’s territory and get

nailed, that’s the breaks.”

A bear was killed last year when it
was found by rangers standing over
the partially eaten body of a missing
photographer, but that action was

! taken, Barbee said, because the body
i could not be seen clearly, and there

was concern that the photographer“
might still be alive.

Had that bear not been found with
the victim, it, too, would have been ,»_-
left alone, he added.

when Earth Day was first cele—

Today. there are two great en—

first arises from the creation of
energy through the burning of

tion of nuclear energy: it also
arises from the profligate use of
that energy.

the production of energy. and the
industrial economy in the United

” A fundamental question now
emerging is Whether the many
hidden costs of energy should be
reﬂected in its price and if so.
how such an- economic change
could be brought about. For ex—
ample. thousands of asthma and
emphysema victims suffer long
hospital stays and some die pre-
maturely because of automobile—
caused air pollution. Society
pays those medical costs. but not
by means of a higher price for
gasoline.

Similarly. the US Navy
spends more than $1 million a
day protecting oil tankers in the
Persian Gulf. These military ex—
penses have to be paid. but they
are paid by taxpayers and not by
a higher cost of oil. Energy would
be used more carefully if it were

priced to cover these and many
.other hidden costs. '

The second great environ-
mental challenge is the slow
death of the earth. If the earth's
temperature continues to grow
warmer because of the burning
of coal and oil and if the ozone is
eaten away by man—made chemi-
cals. there will be a catastrophe
in another half—century. perhaps

' sooner.

No nation acting alone can di-
minish these global dangers. The
next president. however. could
educate this country and th
world community to these pro-"1
found and complex problems
and help move governments to-
ward acti0n. it is a superb and
non—threatening. non-military,
opportunity for global leadership
that is available to the next man

Park concedes Bear 83
victimized by humans

By Jean Heller
Staff Writer

One of the saddest commentaries
in the saga of grizzly No. 83 is the
acknowledgement by bear manage-
ment ofﬁcials that at least some of the
old sow's problems were not of her
own making, and the humans respon-
sible might have escaped punishment.

A detailed, eight-page summary of
No. 83’s troubles near Lake, Fishing
Bridge and Canyon in Yellowstone
National Park shows that on a number
of occasions, the sow was lured into

developed areas when employees of ‘

park Concessioners or park personnel
failed to secure tempting supplies of
grease and garbage.

The ease with which the bear thus
was able to reach those food sources
was a major contributing factor in her
"habituation”-—the process by which

a grizzly learns not to fear humans and .

to expect to find food in developed
areas of the park, according to Super-
intendent Robert Barbee.

It was because of No. 83’s habituation
and her stubborn refusal to stay away
from developed areas, even after being
relocated repeatedly miles away in Yel-
lowstone's back country, that she was
finally trapped and destroyed earlier
this month.

The summary documents at least
27 occasions between 1981 and 1987
when bear 83 was seen in and around
the grease and garbage rooms at the
Lake Hotel and Lake Lodge, the sewage
lagoons at Fishing Bridge and Canyon
and a Canyon garbage dump.

In a number of cases, the bear’s ability
to reach grease and garbage was laid
directly to inadequate security or the
outright failure of employees to lock
doors, gates and cisterns.

"There were a lot of things that hap-
pened on a daily basis which contrib-
uted,” Barbee acknowledged last week.
“Grease traps were left Open, garbage
areas were left open. The sewage
lagoons are not bear-proofed and the
concessioners dump grease in the sew—
age lagoons.”

”We're going to have to start to deal
with all that. While bear 83 has some

regrettable aspects to it, there is an‘

upside. There will be reforms.”

Asked if the persons responsible for
allowing the bear to have access to
grease and garbage were fined or in
any other way disciplined for their
actions, Barbee responded:

”I don’t know. I will look into it. There

is no reason that park employees and

 

 

 

 

 

it concessioners should not be subject
1 to the same penalties aspark visitors.”

Among the entries in the park log
which demonstrate that some of No.
83’s problems were man-caused are:

10/18/82. Tracks—Sow with two cubs

room through an opening torn through

No. 83.

11/18/86. Bear No. 83 gets into Lake
hotel grease cistern (lid left off) and
ate a signiﬁcant amount to grease.

Barbee said such incidents could be
reduced sharply by more diligence by
employees of the park and its conces-

 

sioners in securing potential grizzly
food sources.

"But it would be expensive to bear-
proof all the sewage ponds in Yellow-
stone,” he added. “The one at Canyon
alone is 17 acres, and when you talk
about putting up fences that would
keep out a bear, you’re talking some-
thing very, very substantial.”

There are no other bears known to
frequent the sewage ponds, he said,
adding that No. 83 might have been
after the grease which some facilities
dump into the ponds.

”We might have to require that all

grease be transported out of the park,”
Barbee said.

Dog sniffs out; torch ing agents in arsons

By The Associated Press

MERIDEN, Conn. - Arson in-
vestigators in Connecticut have a
unique tool for tracking down the
sources of suspicious fires, but
this “tool” has four legs, a tail
and a wet nose.

Mattie, a black Labrador re-
triever who loves to nuzzle
strangers, is believed to be the
country’s first working arson
dog, trained to sniff out the re-
mains of liquid fuels or acceler-
ants used in start arson fires,
state and federal authorities say.

ller nose is more sensitive

than state-of—the-art electronic

gadgets and she’s absolutely
fearless sniffing her way through
smoldering rubble, said Trooper
Douglas Lancelot, a trainer at
the state police canine unit and
one of Mattie’s three handlers.

The 3-yea‘r-old dog, with the de—
partment 1% years, cansniff out
minute traces of 17 different
types of accelerant fluids, includ-
ing kerosene, paint remover,
transmission fluid and jet fuel,
Lancelot said. .

Her training was a pilot proj-
ect sponsored by the federal Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said Richard Strobel,
a forensic chemist. with ATF in
Richmond, Va. Authorities in
Maryland, Michigan and IoWa

have since trained their own an

son dogs.

Mattie has worked 49 fire
scenes so far and found acceler-
ants at 30 of them, Lancelot said.
Her work has led to nine arrests.

She detected gasoline on the
pants of a student who torched a

Lan-

_ She sniffed out gaso-
line on the car seat of a suspect

last April.

When Mattie smells an acce-
lerant, she sits down and puts her
nose right on the suspicious spot.

She’s rewarded with a few bits
of kibble, a pat on the head and
the words “Good dog.”

Without Mattie, investigators
routinely ust send dozens of
samples to arforensic laboratory
for analysis, Lancelot said.

But she quickly zeroes in spots
where traces of an accelerant in—

When Spot doesn’t fee

Experts recommend
that people select a vet
in the same way they
would select a
pediatrician for their
children or a doctor for
themselves.

 

By MARY DANIELS

Chicago Tribune

A feline fancier had used the same
vet for years for her cats, the latest a
silver smoke kitten that because of his
color pattern and exuberant coat some-
what resembled an explosion in a fake
fur factory.

When the cat‘s owner arrived for an
appointment one evening, she found
that her regular vet had the flu. His
daughter. a recent graduate of veteri-
nary school, was fillingin.

The owner had some reservations
about a new vet treating her adored cat.

When the young woman professional
came into the consulting room, she
looked at the patient on the exam table,
smiled picked him up and gave him a
big kiss.

The owner relaxed, figuring she had
nothing to worry about. She didn‘t, and
even began asking for the young woman
vet on subsequent visits.

For many pet owners. however, find-
ing even one good vet is trial and error,
sometimes costly both in time and mon-
ey, and in rare cases tragic for the pet.

Sharon Curtis, public information
spokeswoman for the American Veteri-
nary Medical Association, says: “We
recommend that people select a vet in
the same way they would select a pedia-
trician for their children or a doctor for
themselves. '

“In a new neighborhood, talk to
neighbors who have pets,” Curtis says.
“If you are interested in a specific
breed, join a breed club. If you had a vet
in another location, you might ask him
to recommend someone in your new
areaf’

Dr. Sheldon B. Rubin of Blum Animal
Hospital in Chicago says if all else fails,
call a local veterinary association. And
when moving into a new area, pet own-
ers should introduce themselves to a
veterinarian before a problem occurs,
he says.

Jane Alvaro, director of development
and public relations for the Anti-Cruel-
ty Society in Chicago, says: “Make sure
a veterinarian is licensed from an ac-
credited university. Check out the con-
dition of the facility, and make sure it is
clean and doesn‘t smell. Waiting room
facilities should have enough space for
dogs and cats together or for big dogs
who do not like to be near one another."

Find out if the owner is allowed in the
examination room for certain proce-
dures.

"It’s very important to some people
to be in the examining room with their
pets. and to others it‘s not.“ Alvaro says.

Dr. Sheldon B. Rubin of Chicago recommends calling the local veterinary association if all else fails.

 

See specialist after generalist

How does a pet owner know when
his pet needs a specialist, such as a
dermatologist or an orthopedic sur-
geon, in addition to a general practi-
tioner?

“I think your best bet is always to
go to your general practitioner,"
says Dr. Sam Vainisi, a prominent
animal ophthalmologist, whose Illi-
nois practice has been around since
1970.

“He should always be your first
line of defense. If he’s not sure what‘s
going on, he will hopefully refer you

 

to a specialist."

The majority of Vainisi’s and other
veterinary specialists’ practice
comes from referrals.

“Most doctors will try to treat a
problem and say ‘come back in five
days and let me see how it is,”'
Vainisi says.

When in doubt. the pet owner
should ask the vet for a referral to a
specialist. Many veterinary doctors
will be happy to do so, he says.

“Check on the size of the staff. Is the
veterinary technician going to give vac-
cinations, or is the vet himself going to
do it? Not that the former is bad, but it‘s
something you should be aware of," Al-
varo says.

Here are some other points to consid-
er:

I Are the hours convenient? Are
they Open in the evenings for non-emer-
gegcy events?

What are the emergency policies?
Do they have a 24-hour answering line?
Can they do emergency surgery? If they
don’t, can they advise you of an emer-
gency clinic where you can take your
animal?

I Do they have boarding facilities?

Some places also will act as kennels
when you go on vacation.

I What is their billing policy? “Some
vets have deferred billing, and some
may require you to pay immediately.
Some may even accept a charge card. It
is important to know ahead of time, so
there are no surprises," says Curtis of
the AVMA. Alvaro suggests asking for
their basic fees for all their services.
You should know the fees for everything
they're going to do to the animal. in-
cluding lab and blood work.

If you're satisfied with the answers to
the above questions. the next step is to
take your pet in. At that point you'll be
able to say if you like the vet‘s bedside
manner. Does he think of you as just an-

other client? Does the vet use your pet ‘3
name when he handles it?

“If you‘re not satisfied. look some-
place else. There are lots of good vets.“
Alvaro says. “It is important that you
ask questions and that the vet gives you
understandable answers.“

“Make sure there‘s a good rapport be-
tween you and the vet and your pet and
the vet," Curtis says. “Good commumv
cation is essential. It‘s up to the person
to give that animal‘s history."

“You have to ‘feel comfortable." Ru—
bin says. “Is the vet answering your
questions? I think the biggest problem
we have in both human and veterinary
medicine is doctor—patient communica-
tion. We can‘t talk to our patients. but
we can listen to our clients."

An owner should tell the vet the histo-
ry of the pet. If you have moved. ask
your former vet to send photocopies of
the pet's history to the new vet.

Rubin says the pet should get a full
physical exam. starting at the nose and
ending at the tail, and including ears.
eyes, mouth and teeth.

”The vet should listen to the pet's
chest, palpate the abdomen to make
sure there are no growths and every
thing is where it belongs, He should loni;

in a stool sample to look for internal

used.

1/ Since 1985, the National Insti-
tutes of Health have required grant
recipients, such as CU and CSU, to
give painkillers to all animals, in-
cluding rodents, enduring pain.
CSU’s Rollin noted that while hu-
man painkillers are tested on ro-
dents, no one ever bothered to find
out which of them worked best for
the animals themselves until the
new NIH regulation.

1/ Until recently, lab animals
were considered so unimportant
that they were not included in vet-
erinary school curriculum. CSU
vet students now take about 25
hours of lab animal science, com-
pared with about two hours in the
early 19805.

Labs will have to adhere to even
stricter regulations in coming
years from such agencies as the
NIH, the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture and the American Associa-
tion of Accreditation for Laborato-
ry Animal Care. All the agencies
conduct on-site inspections.

Besides animal-care commit-
tees, the USDA's revised Animal
Welfare Act may require exercis-
ing dogs, improving the “psycho-
logical well-being” of primates,
training for all people who handle
lab animals, involving a veterinari—
an in anything expected to cause
an animal pain and USDA licensing
for all veterinarians in charge of
research facilities.

The NIH made similar revisions
in its guidelines, which became law
in 1985. The agency also received
money to enforce the laws and au-
thority to yank its money from labs
that do not comply.

Police themselves

Some scientists oppose regula- .

tion and continue to insist they al-
ready police themselves.

“People getting money from the
feds are scrutinized enough inter-
nally,” said Charles Irvin, a re-
searcher who is chairman of the
Animal Care and Use Committee
at National Jewish Hospital, which
has about 12,500 animals, 12,000 of
them mice. “There’s no question
the changes will have a big impact
on institutions. There’s a greater

cost to do science.”

But more and more, scientists
question whether the use of lab ani-
mals is necessary.

Steve Roper, chairman of the
CSU anatomy and neurobiology de-
partment, is developing a three-di-
mensional computerized human
model for study of anatomy.
Though he developed it for educa-
tional use, he also found it could
eliminate the need for some ani-
mal dissection in physiology labs.

“I’m a dog lover. I have a Siberi-
an husky whom I dearly love,”
Roper said. “I don’t like going to
the dissection floor . I’ve never
worked on monkeys, cats or dogs,
and I would think very seriously
before I_ ever did.”

Large research institutions are
not the only ones sensitized to ani-
mal welfare. Commercial labs,
large and small, are considering
ways to make life better for their
animals.

Annie Laury of Immuno Vet
Inc., a Wheat Ridge company that
makes and tests rabies vaccines,
was supposed to euthanize all dogs
tested because they may have
been exposed to rabies in the lab.
But Laury said she gave some dogs
away and even took one home for
herself.

Colgate-Palmolive Co. in New
York has replaced animal tests
with tests in which a substance is
tested for toxicity on the mem-
brane of a fertilized chicken egg.

Procter & Gamble Co. in Cincin-
nati has cut its use of animals 61
percent since 1984, the firm re-
ports. It has changed controversial
Draize eye—irritation and LD-50
tests, in which researchers feed
animals a substance until they die
to determine lethal dosage. New
tests involve fewer animals and
less stress on those animals.

Public pressure

Some speculate that public pres-
sure isn’t the only factor motivat-

ing change: Researchers fear
groups known as “lab trashers"
who resort to vandalism to bring
about reform. .

“I don‘t see. industry changing
because suddenly they want to be

benevolent to animals. They’re
making changes because we’re
making noise and revealing a lot of
abuses,” said Robin Duxbury, ex-
ecutive director of the Rocky
Mountain Humane Society.

“We’ve proven time and again
that researchers are not policing
themselves,” she said. Otherwise.
groups that break into labs to ex-
pose alleged abuses “wouldn’t. be
uncovering all that crap.”

Such a group is believed to be re-
sponsible for splattering a Curri-
gan Hall sign with red paint and
making a bomb threat before the
opening of the American Associa»
tion of Laboratory Animal Science
convention recently. The confer—
ence was conducted under strict
security.

Stevens and Lynne Kesel, staff
veterinarian at CSU Laboratory
Animal Resources, said the best
way to ward off vandals is good
public relations.

“The people who are real terr‘
ists can‘t get public sympathy . . .
if you keep a clean shop,” Kesel
said.

Despite the new public con-
sciousness, people still overwhelm-
ingly favor use of animals in re
search, Stevens noted.

In a study he conducted in south-
ern Colorado earlier this year, 82
percent of respondents said they
support use of animals in research.
That’s the same percentage as in a
National Association for Biomedi-
cal Research study done in New
York City in 1986.

But what is acceptable animal
research?

“Most. people say animal re-
search is OK. But when you talk
about the use of cosmetics in rab-
bits‘ eyes, they’re overwhelmingly
opposed,” said Canadian philoso- ;
pher Michael Fox, an animal ex— é
perimentation advocate-turned-ab-
olitionist. “People in the field are
having second thoughts on what‘s
justifiable. It may change the char _
acter of scientific research. It‘s tam
early to tell, but that seems to be
the direction.“ ‘ ‘

Close Watch on Man ’s Best Friend

Larry Glickman and a research pal

SUMMARY: Dogs have a history of
aiding mankind, but now they are
entering a new arena of beneﬁt to
humans. Pet canines are useful in
medical research because they
share habitats with their owners
and the animals’ physiological
traits resemble those of humans.
Another plus is that experiments
are not performed on the animals.

ogs have protected our domiciles.
D guided the blind. pulled sleighs in
the northernmost reaches of the
globe. warmed the sleeping bags of explor-
ers and simply kept us company. Now they
are proving useful in a new way: serving as
sentinels for environmentally caused hu-
man disease.

Researchers who study the environmen—
tal causes of human disease (which may
' include diet as well as chemicals in the
home and environment) have always had
two ways to approach the problem, each of
which has major shortcomings. One is to
interview victims of a disease to ﬁnd out
which potential causes they share in their
backgrounds and to compare these expo-

sures with those of people who do not have
the disease. When most victims of lung
cancer were found to smoke. for example.
cigarettes became a suspect cause of the
disease. One problem with this technique
is that many environmentally caused dis-
eases. most notably cancers, take so many
years to develop in human beings that the
information may come years too late to
protect people from exposure.

The second approach is to study the
effects of suspect chemicals on laboratory
animals. Results come relatively quickly.
but researchers continually debate the rel—
evance of studies that expose rodents to
doses of Chemicals far more massive than
those humans probably would encounter
(Insight. June 29).

Enter the pet dog. Researchers study
pets the same way they perform epide-
miological studies of humans: by searching
for common elements in their environ-
ments. through interviews with their own—
ers. to study speciﬁc diseases. Dogs are
excellent surrogates for humans. says Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania veterinarian Larry
T. Glickman. because they are biologically
more similar to humans than are rodents
and because they share habitation and food
with humans.

The virtue of dogs as epidemiological
subjects. says the veterinarian. is that their
life cycle is so much shorter than that of
humans; this means that diseases develop
much more quickly. “Lung cancer typically
occurs in a dog at 6 to 8 years. while in
humans it occurs after 30 to 40 years.” says
Glickman. a leader among a handful of
researchers who do this type of work.

To date. Glickman and his colleagues
have carried out some of the most extensive
work in the ﬁeld. His ﬁrst study. in the early
1980s. found that dogs could yield valuable
information about human mesothelioma. a
form of cancer that is nearly always fatal.

“There had been a lot of publicity about
mesothelioma in humans because it is
known to be associated with asbestos ex-
posure,’ he says. “When it was recognized
that asbestos causes mesothelioma. the re-

- suiting lawsuits put the Johns Manville

vzrpany into bankruptcy. But studies
lound that 40 percent of people who de-
velop mesothelioma never had industrial
exposures.”

Dogs helped locate sources of asbestos
exposure in the home. he says. because
“dogs don’t go to work.” The short canine
latency period was equally important in
establishing this link. People usually take
three to four decades to develop mesothe-
lioma. “if a dog develops mesothelioma.

you know it had to be exposed in the home
in the last ﬁveyears. Now. each time a dog
comes into our clinic and is diagnosed as
having mesothelioma. we notify the health
department.”

In another study. Glickman is trying to
determine whether exposure to cigarette
smoke causes bladder cancer. “We have 80
dogs with bladder cancer and an equal
number of controls without bladder cancer.
We have interviewed the owners to assess
diet and smoking histories in the home."
He has yet to analyze the data.

Glickman hopes soon to study repro-
ductive hazards —— birth defects. miscar-
riage rates and pathologies of the reproduc-
tive tract —— that may be posed by living
near a toxic waste cleanup site by surveying
the local pets. The ovaries from spayed
pets. he says, offer a unique opportunity to
search for damage in the reproductive sys~
tem.

Pets can also be used to. study the inﬂu-
ence of diet on human disease. he says.
because so much of a dog’s diet is shared
with its owners: “Twenty-ﬁve to 60 percent
of a dog’s diet is'table scraps.” In a pilot
study. Glickman found that the inﬂuence of
diet on breast cancer in dogs was very
similar to that in human beings; high fat
was associated‘with both increased likeli-
hood of contracting the disease and lower
survival rates after surgery. Again. a virtue
of dog studies is getting the information
quickly. “We usually know the outcome for
most of the dogs within a year. A woman
has to be followed for 10 to 15 years.” '

Glickman’s work is only the beginning
of what may become a burgeoning ﬁeld.
The National Academy of Sciences is so
interested in the use of pets (as well as
wildlife) as epidemiological subjects that it
is funding a study of their usefulness under
a program created by the Superfund Re-
authorization Act.

The National Cancer Institute plans to
search for enVironmental causes of cancer
across the United States using data on dogs
and cats. “I have information from 18
schools of veterinary medicine.” says the
institute’s Dr. Howard Hayes. “We have a
questionnaire we are ﬁnishing to address
speciﬁc cancers in multiple geographic
Sites.”

While millions of pets soon may be
providing researchers with useful informa—
tion. for once. animal rights activists are
not alarmed. Not only are no experiments
performed on the animals. but the animals
themselves stand to beneﬁt as much from
the research as human beings.

the Lowry Park Zoological Garden in Tampa on Saturday.
The monkeys are the first animals to be moved from their
cages to new “natural habitat” homes during the 200’s

by Pat Yarnot, Curator of Education,
Lowry Park Zoo

Objective: Children will learn that all forms of wildlife have individual specific living
requirements which are considered even in captivity.

Materials: Enough copies of Monday’s Zoo Reporter article “Rockin’ at the New
200”, Reference Books, Classified ad section

Vocabulary: Barriers, Re-bar, Habitat

Background: The designers of the 200 are trying to create a zoo with lush tropical
plantings, waterfalls and streams both surrounding and as a part of the animal
’ containments. The task was to produce an atmosphere both pleasing to our public and
suitable for each of our animal’s needs while considering both the animals’ and
' , public’s safety. Research and consideration were given to available park space,
number of animals, habitat needs, where the animals live (tree, ground), and animals’
physical abilities (arm stretch, leaping and climbing)
Activity:
1. Discuss the importance of the rock work after reading the story. Brainstorm
problems the rock makers have had. What could you safely do to a zoo habitat if
the animal is a chewer, terrific jumper, good swimmer?
2. Divide the class into small groups. Each group choses a different animal that
will live at Lowry Park Zoo. (Past articles)
3. Each group researches its animals habitat needs and special abilities.
4. Teacher should now familiarize the class with classified ads from the
newspaper’s Classified Section.
5. Each group writes a classified ad describing the zoo habitat that might be
created for their animal.
6. Collect the ads. Have each student write all of the researched animals on a
sheet of paper.
'7. Read each ad and have each student choose the animal it best fits. (Some ads
might fit more than one animal)

HEN I WAS GROWING UP IN NEW YORK, THE CUL-
tural and social center of the city was the old Cen- ?
tral Park Zoo. Early Saturday mornings, my father
and I would take the 59th Street trolley with its ;
scratchy wicker seats over to Fifth Avenue and

trot down the steps past the crenellated towers of

my best pal—a boyfriend my father wholehearted- i
ly approved—was Joe the chimp, an antic charac-
ter who zoomed around the zoo paths on roller i

skates, wearing a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform and g
a dead cigar in the comer of his smile. Later in the ;
morning, when the zoo got crowded with Park Avenue moth- I
ers, nannies, and children in coats with velvet buttons, Ioe’s j
keeper put him back in a cage. The zoo was enchanting and ,
frightening. The baleful glare of the tiger as he paced his narrow ‘

cage and the foul-smelling, mysterious mound of matted hair

with horns called a yak—both appeared in my nightmares. I :
ﬁrst saw sex at the zoo; in the pungent air of the Antelope ,
House, two tayras—South American mammals—were going at i
it, screaming and humping. When I asked my father about it, he
said they were having a ﬁght. On the way home, we stopped at '
3 will be penguins and puffins, arctic foxes and monkeys. and a

the Menemsha bar for a quick one. He drank scotch neat, and I

had 3 Shirley Temple with two cherries and watched the artiﬁ- }

cial waterfall behind the bar.

Ten years later, in the sixties, the zoo was New York’s best
outdoor café, the Deux Magots of a town with few outdoor
meeting places. I used to run into Garry Winogrand there,
and we’d swap hints about the hippo feeding schedules or the
best time to see the new baby gorilla swing from the bars. He
published a book of photographs of the zoo; the best was of
the mother gorilla and her baby, looking like a Piero della
Francesca Madonna and child. I ran into Frank Stella at the
zoo, and my Uncle Fred, and a lot of people I had known at
school, and a shy woman with short hair who turned out to
be a photographer named Diane Arbus. For me, the zoo was
what Greenwich Village had been once; there was always
someone to talk with—in the ratty cafeteria or leaning on the
rails of the seal pond or in the dense, sensual, smelly air of
the animal houses—and there was always some heated argu-
ment going on over politics, human or animal behavior. or f-
stops as we ate soggy doughnuts and drank the weak zoo
coffee. The place teemed with life—the peanut shells and
Cracker lacks underfoot, the hawking balloon men and the
screams of happy children, the luxuriant jungle of smells.

Years later, I brought my daughter to the zoo. She
thumbed down my favorites and fell in love with the ponies.
Silver and Blade, who pulled a little donkey cart ﬁlled with
delighted and shrieking children around a tiny woodsy track
at the south end. When the track was closed, she hung
around the pony stables across from where the old yak used
to rub his matted fur against his phony boulders.

A few years ago, the zoo was closed. Billboards went up
proclaiming that it would be replaced by a better, more com-
passionate zoo. The new zoo has its own public-affairs de-
partment, and someone there told me that when it Opens next
spring, the new 200 will have no cages. The animals will be
seen in a series of naturalistic settings representing climatic
regions. Instead of lions and tigers, gorillas and hippos. there

few polar bears. It sounds like a terriﬁc animal-viewing habi-
tat. I doubt that it will ever be a real zoo again.

Cleo the hippo, 2, shipped to the Cincinnati 200 from Toronto' In 1 986, now shares a pad with sister pachydenn Gretchen, 22.

MOVE OVER, FELIX AND OSCAR,
MOVE WAYOVER—THESE TWO ARE
A REALLY HEAVY-DUTY ODD COUPLE

Noah obviously didn’t think of it, but
Ogden Nash might have: A 22-year-
old female African elephant named
Gretchen and a 2-year-old female Nile
hippopotamus called Cleopatra are liv-
ing amicably together at the Cincinnati
200, which says it is the only US. zoo
to house those two species together.

“The two play like children,” says
the head keeper of the elephant
house, Herb Kingsbury. “When Gretch-
en is lying down, Cleo will lick her

around the ears and bite her ears play-
fully. They go in the pool together.
They live in their own little world.”

It’s a world that Cleo, an export from
the Toronto 200, entered with trepida-
tion last year. One look at Gretchen’s
imposing trunk and Cleo was all set to
pack hers. Instead, she dove to the
bottom of the enclosure’s pool. Now
the two get along swimmingly even
though Gretchen outweighs Cleo by
6,300 pounds, give or take a snack.

Cincinnati’s experiment began near-
ly 10 years ago when Gretchen’s keep-
ers saw her reaching over a large iron
barrier and playing with a hippo neigh-
bor named Maudie. Eventually Gretch-
en and Maudie became roomies. Their
friendship ended with Maudie’s death
in 1985, but the bereft Gretchen has
found solace with Cleo. Says Kings-
bury, who knows a peculiar twain when
he sees one, “it’s like they grew up
together.” El

Brownie took 0!! for home, a few

“Brownie. look at the mess

Brownie bravely walks up and sniffs
Burton’s leg.

The day’s biggest challenge is
provided by a mldsize brown dog
with ears the shape and size of a
deer’s.

The stray has become an ex-

seems to like her.

“That little ugly brown dog,"
says Lomaneck, pointing, after Bur-

A neighbor volunteers meat loaf

friend. Deer—ears eats every morsel '

away as soon as she gets it. A cou-

with his rope leash.

After eating the meat loaf and
going through a big hunk of bread.
Deer-ears lies in the dirt to rest.
Burton tries to sneak around the
house and come up behind her, but
she cocks an ear and is off again.

After a while, Burton surrenders
-— at least for the day. Since Deer-
ears has been in Lomaneck's house,
Burton suggests that the man try to
lure her there and call him. Or, he
could drop off a trap.

Burton prepares to leave. Loma-
neck sits down near the dog -— and
suddenly lunges. He catches her by
thehind legs.

Into the truck she goes. Chances
are remote that anyone would adopt
a dog that skittish around humans.

And so this day likely begins
Deerears' last week of life.

Jim Burton doesn’t let sleeping dogs lie

By PHILIP MORGAN
Tribune Staff Writer

LAKE WALES —- Don’t stare a dog straight in the
eye. He takes it as a challenge. It makes him mad. But
don't completely avert your eyes either. Don’t show
fear, because that makes him want to justify it.

Those are a couple of lessons Jim Burton has picked
up —— along with many a dog — in his six years as a
Polk County Animal Control officer. He has a great ap-
preciation for their intelligence, their survival skills.

“I've had some where I’ve been trying to catch them
a year and a half, two years. And then you finally ap-
prehend them," says Burton, 36, steering his bright-or-
ange animal paddy wagon through the neighborhoods
and rolling grove land of eastern Polk County.

He sometimes has to answer a call about a rabid
raccoon or squirrel. He cites cat owners for failing to
vaccinate their pets. But because the county leash law
does not apply to cats, he does not pick them up unless
a caller complains about one.

So most of his day is spent dealing with dogs. When
he pursues one that has given him the slip for months, it
becomes a challenge. Some run as soon as the truck
appears; Burton theorizes that they tune into the engine
frequency.

He catches a lot of dog when they are asleep. He
removes his keys and pocket change so he won’t rattle;
makes sure they can’t pick up his scent in the wind and

 

 

that he won’t cast a shadow. He creeps upbehind with. .'

his control stick and lowers the rope loop over the dog’s
head.

Sometimes, it seems, the dog simply surrenders.

“You sort of get that feeling like maybe they were
just tired of you trying to catch them, so they let you.”

Burton counts only two bad bites among the times
dogs didn’t surrender. One tore into the ligaments of his
left hand, putting him out of work till he could use it
again. He raises his pants leg to show the other wound,
a puncture behind his right knee. Weeks later, the
wound still looks nasty.

Though he approaches no pit bull lightly, Burton
knows they hold no monopoly on ferocity.

“There are vicious shepherds, Rottweilers, you
name it. the list goes on. Chihuahuas —— they can be
vicious, can’t do anything ’cept eat your heels up, but

I

believe me, they can.”

A Chihuahua once went for his throat, he relates. As
he reached down to pick it up, the dog lunged and did
considerable damage to the front of Burton’s shirt.

Though no higher mammal has inﬂicted injury, Bur-
ton has felt at times that he would be punched momen-
tarily. He calls in a sheriff‘s deputy when he meets
great resistance.

Many people are courteous, he says, even after he
fines them — $15 for allowing a dog to run loose, $30
for failing to have an up-to-date tag. He says he tries to
maintain a courteous bearing whatever the reaction. In
a job that draws a lot of wrath anyway, Burton realizes
the importance of public relations.

“That right there is what makes the difference be-
tween an animal control officer and a dog catcher," he
says. “We’re not just out there running the streets grab-
bing up people’s poodles.”

The job teaches lessons in human nature, too. It
surprises him how important a pet can be to an owner
-— until it’s out of sight.

Many owners know their dogs are in the pound. But.
as Noel Wrehsnig, another officer, explains, it’s cheaper
to go out and get a new dog than pay the fine.

Some owners turn their pets over to the pound. Rea-
sons vary. Wrehsnig reads a form attached to the cage
of an 18-month-old greyhound — the owner didn’t have
time to train or handle the dog. Because it was turned
over to the pound, the dog can be destroyed at the
county’s discretion. Dogs picked up on the street are
kept seven days. _

Burton says he took this job because he was comfort-
able with animals — having had pets all his life, and
having worked in a kennel -— and because he needed
work.

But after doing it a while, he realized that it is a job
that “desperately needs doing.” He picks up not only
vicious dogs, but sick and wounded dogs —— shot or
maimed by a car. He finds some so weak from starva-
tion they can barely stand.

“I think a person actually has to have a great
amount of love, on the contrary to probably what some
would want to think — ‘Well, that guy must really hate
animals having that job.’ But that’s not the case at all, at
least not in my case.”

The public generally underestimates the problem of
unchecked growth in the animal population, he says —-
of unvaccinated strays roaming the streets, especially in
a state where rabies is quite common in raccoons and
squirrels, the animals that dogs and cats most often
come in contact with.

Some days Burton picks up 18 to 20 dogs and cats. This
is a slow day. The trap he left with a man the other day
worked, and he picks up a kitten.

This one and others have been howling and fighting.
keeping the man awake. The cat hisses and claws as
Burton moves it from trap to truck cage, the loop of his
control stick around the animal’s middle.

By Teddie Johnson

All the little critters are fondly remembered

er eyes follow my every action, and when

I’ve set myself to some task, she settles

into one of her “spots." If I’m doing the

dishes or cooking, she’ll be next to the
cabinet where she can press her ear to the woodwork.
If I’m in the bath, she’s right outside the door. If I’m
watching TV, she’s in “her” chair. When it’s bedtime,
it’s next to the night stand. But always in sight— and
near.

Dr. Schell, her vet, said dogs are like that when
. they’re in pain. And I’m sure she’s always in pain, in
spite of the fact that several thousands of dollars have
been spent on her well being and to keep her comfort-
able. 1 have never regretted one cent of it as i cannot
bear to see her suffer.

She’s not even mine — except in my heart — and
she does live with me. In fact, Lori is her owner, but I
have loved her — and i never use that word loosely —
since she was given to Lori on her 16th birthday.
Dressed up with a pink ribbon around her neck and
dubbed Desera Potpourri Von Kloppel, she checked
out all the guests and promptly made her little self at
home. But that was nine years ago and we were both
young.

Now we’re Little Old Ladies, me 65 and she 63 in

human years, with most of the same ailments -— _

arthritis and failing eyesight. The only physical prob.
lem that she has that I do not is bad ears, a problem
common to cockers.

it wasn’t always thus. She had her young and frisky

days. Like the Christmas when all the guests had been
served and were happily eating from their trays. i had
left my plate on the dining table until I finished serv-
ing. That little pup leaped from a chair onto the table
and ran off with my turkey leg, which happened to be
the last of the bird. So only some trimmings for me.
Don’t know what the swat with the newspaper did for
her, but the whole episode taught me to tip the chairs
toward the table when not in use. And to remove any
valuables from low lying furniture or she’d chew them
up.
Before she learned her P’s and Q’s, I lost a number
of things. But she did learn. Now l’d give most any-
thing to see her running young and free with her ears
flapping in the breeze just one more time.

l have a special rapport with animals; whether they
were a family pet or not it was always me they gravi-
tated to. They were all special in their own way.

First, there was Prissy, a dear little lady dog who
lived up to her name with her happy wriggling. She
followed me everywhere and, like Mary’s little lamb,
she followed me to school one day and was hit by a
car. That was my first experience with death and grief.
My two brothers helped me bury her under her favor-
ite tree.

Then there was Bobby, the raccoon that l raised on
milk in a Coke bottle with a baby bottle nipple. One
night he heard the call of the wild and took off —-
never to return.

After I had my own family, there was Laddie the
collie —- ever so faithful and so patient even when the
cat would tease him. it broke my heart and I don’t
think my son Ken ever forgave me for giving him to
another caring family when we moved from the coun-
try to a small apartment.

We kept the cat. She had appeared on our doorstep

Desera Potpourri Von Kloppel and her loving owner. Toddie Johnson.

one day —-'just a wee kitten. We named her Cat. She
purred, but the only time i ever heard her meow was
the night she had her kittens. Just one loud meow —-
and I never heard her do it again. She was the only cat
lever had.

Later we had Sambo —— as black as his name.
During this little fellow’s residence, we were using a
wake-up call service as l had a problem hearing the
alarm. Sometimes I didn’t even hear the wake-up call
- but Samba did. He would push the receiver off the
hook —- then come bark at my bedside until I an-
swered.

Ginger was a mixed breed Dachshund but a true
blueblood lady. Genteel in every action, from how she
ate her food to how she played with her pups. When
my children and their playmates got too noisy. she‘d
go and bark at each one —- then calmly go sit down
again -— giving me a look that cleariy said, “Can’t you
control your own kids?” She slept beside my bed
every night of her life until she died two years ago at
age 16. '

There were several parakeets —- each one unique.
Pepe kept us amused with his antics —— such as push—
ing all the silverware off the table just to hear the
clatter and riding round and round the Christmas tree

in the Lionel train. His favorite perch was my eye
glasses.

Chris loved water and would sit in the soap dish and
dive into the dish pan. Retrieve him — he’d dry off
and then do it all over again.

Seymore was the only one I ever taught to talk. He
could pick up a new phrase in just a few days. He had
a vocabulary of approximately 200 words and could
use the correct phrase on the proper occasion. He
would recognize my voice on the phone and ask,
“Honey, what you been doing all day?” He could sing
the first few bars of “Yankee Doodle Dandy” when we
lost him.

Now I have Honey, who, unlike the others who
were allowed to ﬂy free in the house, stays in his cage
where he chirps and trills much like a canary. And of
course i still have Desera. But these two will be the last
of the little animals for me. I loved them all but my
heart belongs to Desera Potpourri Von Kioppel.

J In 1971 Congress passed the Wildl
Horse and Burro Act in an effort to stop
people from rounding up wild horses,

’, often by poisoning their water holes, so

? they could sell them to slaughterhouses

3 to make dog food. The legislation put
the Government in charge of maintain-

. ing existing herds and safeguarding
them “living symbols of the historic
_ and pioneer spirit of the West.”

But once protected, the horse popula-
tion swelled to 64,000 in 1980 from
17,000 in 1971. While that is only a frac-
tion of the millions that roamed the
"range at the turn of the century, it was
enough to bring a growing tide of com-

, plaints from cattle and sheep ranchers.

As a result Congress tripled the

 

 

 

‘budget for the roundup program to
.nearly $17 million in 1985, and the num-
ber of horses in the corrals jumped.
The Bureau of Land Management esti-
mates there are about 44,000 horses on
the range today, a number that offi-
cials would like to reduce to about
30,000.

Meanwhile, Mr. Boyles said the Gov:
ernment had not been as successful in
finding people willing to adopt the ani-
mals at a cost of. $125. ‘In fiscal year
1985, more than 9,500 horses and wild
burros were adopted. The next year,
the number'dropped to 7,600, and in the
last fiscal year, the number of adop-
tions for which fees were paid was
fewer than 5,000.

Of those 5,000 animals, about'l,200
were burros. Mr. Boyles said there is a
waiting list for people wanted to adopt
the burros, which he said are some-
what more exotic, easier to care for
and can be obtained for $75. The Gov-
ernment estimates there are about
5,500 wild burros in the West, a popula-
tion they would like to stabilize at about

3,300.
‘Aggressive Adoption’ Urged

Mr. Hillman and other critics fault
the Government for not doing enough
to advertise the horse adoption pro-
gram, and also say the wranglers who
round up the horses on Government
contract are not selective in the horses
they cull from the wild herds, too often
taking animals that are too old to have
any appeal.

The advisory panel that reviewed the
agreed that the Government needed to
~develop “an aggressive adoption poli-
cy, and seek approval for use of paid
'advertising when free advertising can-
' not be obtained.”
; " Bruce Stevens, a lifelong cowboy and

.Government employee who oversees
the wild horse ranch here, said he had

 

ghelped hundreds of people adopt ani-

mals, ranging from Amish farmers.;"-

lwho were looking for draft horses [Ow

who wanted gentle riding stock. V

But even Mr. Stevens, who wears a
big black cowboy hat and goes by the‘
name Smoky, concedes that many of;
the animals in the pens here are not

very appealing.

.:i

He said the horses kept at Bloomfield:

a cost of about $2.50 per day per'horse.

is situated in what once was a cattle

feed lot. In'addition to Bloomfield and; .

another large holding area in Nevadagv
the Government also keeps horses at'
smaller adoption centers in Pennsylva-
nia and Tennessee. ‘ .-

The advisory panel, which was ap-
pointed by the Federal Government
and consisted of ranchers as well as”
representatives of environmental and

animal protection groups, concluded f

that it was wrong that “increasing por- ‘
tions of funds are spent to maintain,
thousands of excess wild horses for an
indeterminate period of time, rather,
than to manage and protect the _ anig‘
malsintheir natural habitat.” . ,v

They - proposed permitting euthana- ..
sia for any animals that are not

Wild Horse Program Called a Burden on

By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT
Special to The New York Times

BLOOMFIELD, Neb. Dec. 22 — On
the rolling plains of northeast Nebras-
ka, the Federal Government manages
the nation’s largest wild horse ranch
with 3,000 mares, colts and stallions
Confined in pens across 74 acres.

Rounded up by Government wran-
glers as part of a program to control
the herds of wild horses on public lands
in the West, the animals are among
some 7,000 horses now in Federal cor-
rals across the country, where they
await adoption by people willing to pay
up to $125 each for them. -

But in recent years, the the Govern-

ment’s horse inventory has increased,
as the numbers of paid adoptions have
dropped off. With the Government’s
bill for feeding the horses now more
than $7 million a year, a sharp debate
has grown over the program and,
specifically, over whether the Govern-
ment should be able to use euthanisia
—to dispose of surplus horses.

70,000 Horses Adopted

“When we’re cutting programs for
the poor in this country, should we be
feeding excess wild horses?” Robert
Burford, the director of the Bureau of
Land Management, asked recently.
“Someone needs to bite the bullet.”

."I‘he Bureau of Land Management,

which administers the program,
argues that public sentiment on behalf
of the animals is forcing the Govern-
ment to spend millions of dollars to

tend horses nobody wants. He cited the "

findings of a special advisory panel-last
year that recommended using euthana—
sia to dispose of horses not adopted
aft-er90days.

.But animal protection groups and
others oppose killing the animals, ar-
guing that the surplus of captured

'horses is a problem of the Govern—
‘-\ment’s own making.

f: Since 1973 the Government has"

1 placed with private families and ranch-
_ers about 70,000 of the 90,000 wild

'l' horses and burros it has removed f rom‘

public lands in 10 Western states, cap—
‘tuted in roundups that are part mili-
; tary maneuverand part wild West,

; Part of Large Shipments

Moreover, 'in a lawsuit filed in
hlevada last year, the Animal Protec-
tion Institute of America, an organiza-

_ tion based in Sacramento, Calif., as-

serted that most of the horses that
were placed by the Government last
year were not adopted by private own-
ers. Instead, the group said, the ani-
mals were part of large shipments to a
relatively small number of people,
some of whom intended to later sell the
animals at a profit for slaughter.

Critics say the Government is round-
ing up too many wild horses, many of
them old and infirm, to assuage the in-
terests of ranchers in the West. The
ranchers have long regarded the ani—

Should the
Government kill
the surplus
animals?

 

Under current regulations, any per-
son who takes a wild horse must wait a
full year before receiving legal title to
it. Once someone has title to the ani—
mal, they presumably are permitted to

j sell the animals to slaughterhouses,
, which normally pay from $220 to $250
{9, for a 1,000-pound animal. .
‘ Robert Hillman, an official with the
Animal Protection Institute of Amer-
, ica, said the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment policy on horses was tailored to
,suit the interests of cattle ranchers.
“The idea is, just do whatever you have
to do, but get the horses off the range "
he said. ’

The Bureau of Land Management
disagrees with such criticism, and
argues the Government is a victim of

 

 

its own good intentions.

 




 

A F ROG’S DAY IN COURT .

BY MADELINE

his year was not business

as usual for the animal-
rights movement. Of course,
there were the usual demon-
strations, some minor van-
dalism, and a sprinkling of
serious incidents. In April,
for instance, the Animal Lib-
eration Front claimed re-
sponsibility for a ﬁre that
caused $3.5 million worth
of damage to a veterinary
medicine clinic under con—
struction at the University
of California at Davis. And in
August other militants stole
sick cats from a US. Depart-
ment of Agriculture labora-
tory in Beltsville, Maryland.

But there was something
new in 1987: researchers fre-
quently found themselves
pushed by animal-rights ad-
vocates into unfamiliar polit-
ical and legal arenas where
they had to explain why they
believe animal experimen-
tation is essential to medi-
cal progress. And more than
ever the scientists ended up
losing. “The animal-rights
movement is coming of age, ”
says John McArdle, scien—
tiﬁc director of the New Eng-
land Anti-Vivisection Soci-
ety in Boston. “It’s realizing
the potential power that it
has.”

In March the King County
Superior Court in Seattle
ruled that the state’s open-
meeting law applies to meet-
ings of the Animal Care
Committee at the University
of Washington, from which
animal-rights groups had
been excluded. Since 1985

proposed animal research—
have been required by federal
law for any institution receiv-
ing federal research funds.
The university had unsuc-
cessfully argued that the
committee meetings were
merely advisory sessions and
as such not covered by the

state law.

In Cambridge, Massachu-
setts, home of Harvard, MIT,
and the Whitehead Institute
of Biomedical Research,
animal-rights activists con-
vinced the city council in
May to pass an order that
largely bans the use of two

controversial toxicity tests.
They had long argued that
these tests—which have been
used for decades, particular-
ly to test the Safety of cosmet-
ics and household products
-—are cruel and unnecessary.
One, the long-established
“lethal dose 50,” sets tox-
icity standards by determin-
ing how much of a substance

" is needed to kill half the ani-

mals receiving it. The other,
the Draize test, evaluates a
chemical’s ability to cause
damage to a rabbit’s eye.

Although the ban is the
ﬁrst of its kind in this country,
it is mostly symbolic. The
two toxicity tests are more
widely used in industry than
at the city’s major research
institutions. Even so, the uni-
versities are girding them-
selves against more legal
challenges. “I think it’s a
fairly obvious strategy now, ”
says Jane Corlette, director of
health policy in the govem-
ment-relations ofﬁce at Har-
vard. “The more time and
money that institutions like
ours have to spend to defend
ourselves, the less there is for
research.”

In September, still sting-
ing from the ﬁrst loss, Cam-
bridge scientists showed up
in record numbers at a city
council meeting to speak out
against two versions of a pro—
posed ordinance. In its strict—
est form the ordinance would
require researchers to submit
proposals involving painful
experiments on animals to
the city’s Animal Commis-
sion, which oversees Cam-
bridge’s animal shelters and
pet licensing and investigates

incidents of cruelty to ani-
mals. The commission
would have the ability to veto
experiments it deemed not
worthwhile.

As it turned out, the coun-
cil decided to put off voting
on the proposals. But re-
searchers fear that if the more
rigorous version eventually
passes, it could stop certain
types of animal experiments
and could cripple progress in
medicine and biology.

The president of the Cam-

bridge Committee for Re-
sponsible Research, Gul
Agha, who drafted the pro-
posed legislation, says the re-
searchers are overreacting.
“The ordinance really ad-
heres to the principles of a
democracy,” he says.
“My target is to create
openness in the system
so that the public view
prevails, not my view
and not the institutions’
view.”

Corlette counters,

“In our opinion, the
whole notion of having
an outside body deter-
mine what research
should be done is a
breach of academic
freedom.” Animal-
rights advocates, how-
ever, are questioning
just how far that aca-
demic freedom ex-
tends—and not only in
the research laboratory,

 

 

but in the classroom as well.

In April, Jenifer Graham,
a 15-year-old student in Vic-
torville, California, made
national headlines when she
refused to perform the frog
dissection that was required
in her high school biology
class. Graham, a staunch
vegetarian who does not
wear leather or other prod-
ucts derived from animals,
insisted that she had learned
frog anatomy adequately by
studying models and dia-
grams. She also performed
“dissections” using a com-
puter. program called Opera-
tion Frog, which is a full-
color simulation of a frog
dissection.

Nevertheless, her teachers

insisted that the only way
they could test her knowl-
edge was by having her iden-
tify anatomical structures in
an already-dissected frog. “I
didn’t want any part of that, ”
Graham says.

Although she is not the”

ﬁrst student to refuse on
moral grounds to do a dis-
section, she is the ﬁrst to
take her case to court.
Graham has ﬁled a suit in
federal court contending that
her beliefs are equivalent to a
religion and that therefore
the school violated her First
Amendment rights.

Also this year the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania School
of Veterinary Medicine made
concessions to two students

‘~\‘£\" ‘\\ \: ‘Q‘x

who refused to practice sur-
gical techniques on healthy
dogs, although such surgery
is often done as part of a vet-
erinarian’s education. The
students asked if they could
operate instead on terminally
ill dogs that were going to be
killed anyway for humane
reasons. When the school re-
fused, Gary Francione, a
professor of law at the univer-
sity, ﬁled suit on the students’
behalf. It resulted in the
school’s capitulation.

Many animal-rights activ-
ists say these types of actions
indicate a new awareness
among the next generation of
scientists. “It’s increasingly
common for students to ques-
tion just what it is they are

supposed to be learn-
ing by doing a dissec-
tion,” says Randall
Lockwood, director of
higher education pro-
. grams for the Humane
Society of the United
States. “Carving up a
frog,” he says, “doesn’t
teach a student to think
inquisitively. It teaches
that living things are
just commodities that
can be bought and
thrown out at the end
of class.” D

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for measures to
reduce the amount of plastic waste in the world's oceans.

I am too well aware of the environmental damage caused by plastic
pollution. The National Academy of Science estimates that more than
52 million pounds of plastics are dumped into the sea each year by
commercial fishing fleets, who also lose an estimated 290 million
pounds of plastic fishing gear. Plastic waste is especially harmful
in the ocean, where approximately one million seabirds and 100,000
marine mammals are killed by plastic garbage each year.

As you may know, Congress is currently considering several
proposals to restrict and/or ban certain practices related to the
. disposal of plastic products. S. 633 would prohibit onshore disposal
of plastics where the material could be washed or blown into the
water. S. 559 would prohibit non-photo-degradable plastic six-pack
holders, which have been banned in eleven states already. And H.R.
H7” would require the Environmental Protection Administration and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to study the plastic
pollution issue and make recommendations to Congress. Provisions of
many of these proposals are expected to win Congressional approval in
the coming months.

You may also be interested to know that the Senate recently
approved Annex V of the international MARPOL treaty, which prohibits
the dumping of plastic waste within 200 miles of the 0.8. Coast.
Implementing legislation will soon be considered and is not expected
to face much opposition.

Although I do not sit on any of the committees that have
jurisdiction over these proposals, I nevertheless look forward to
considering them with your concerns in mind once they reach the floor
of the Senate.

Thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns with
me. I hOpe you will continue to keep me informed on issues important

to us all.

TAMPA -— On May 28, 1975, a Canadian biologist
robbed the nests of whooping cranes in Canada’s
Northwest Territory. Each nest had two eggs; he took
just one from each, for a total of 14 eggs.

Thus was born thesecond wild population of

Scientists working to save the endangered whoop-
ing crane from extinction were helped by the pro-
gram, because only one breeding colony remained
and that flock of 130 could be wiped out by an un-
timely hurricane or oil spill along the Gulf Coast of
Texas.

But the program’s initial success has been tem-
pered by the progress made since then.

The technique used, called crossfostering, has
produced about 20 whoopers that spend the winter in
New Mexico and migrate each spring to Idaho and
western Wyoming to breed.

The trouble is, after 12 years, the whoopers
haven’t started mating, and so no little whoopers are
being produced to expand the flock. Biologists aren’t
sure why the cranes lack the romantic urge.

“There seems to be more males than females, for
some reason. So far, none of them have paired up to
breed,” said Jim Lewis, whooping crane coordinator

“We’ve had males and females showingsome

that has fostered hope that some will mate, Lewis
said.
Scientists believe the lack of breeding success

. may be related to the small number of birds and the

wide area over which they are spread.

“When they get ready to breed, they have no
social contact,” said Steve Nesbitt, a biologist for the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission.
“It’s like if they had a cocktail party and only one
bird showed up.”

in the running.

If approved, about 100,000 acres of marshes and
grassy uplands in Osceola and Okeechobee counties
would be the site of the experiment.

But two other sites, one in Michigan and another
. in southeast Georgia’s Okefenokee Swamp, also are
being considered for the next whooping crane colo-
ny.

“There probably won’t be any surplus eggs until
1990 or possibly after that,” Lewis said. '

The whooping crane, known for its trumpeting
call that can be heard a mile away, has been making
a slow but steady comeback since it almost disap-
peared from the planet in the early 19405.

See WHOOPING, Page 61

 

 




 

0 From Page 1.1

 

The legendary bird once thrived
throughout most of North America
but now numbers only about 150 in
the wild and 43 in captivity.

" Until about the mid-18005, it win-
tered in southern marshes from the
Atlantic Ocean to western Mexico
and nested in the summer in the
north-central United States and Can-
ada.

The number of whooping cranes
was somewhere between 500 and
1,200 in the mid-18005. But by the
early 19005, the number began to
fall precipitously, due in part to
hunting, but mostly because of the
destruction by man of the vast
marshes and prairies the bird needs
for survival.

Each pair of whooping cranes
needs about 1,000 acres of marsh
for the summer breeding. The pairs
need 200 to 400 acres each in the
winter feeding. This requirement -~
coupled with the bird’s lack of toler-
ance for man —— leaves very little
suitable habitat.

“The only way the bird has
made a comeback is that they’ve
been given a refuge for the winter
and summer grounds,” said Tom
Stehn, a biologist at the Aransas Na-
tional Wildlife Refuge in Texas, the
,birds’ winter home.

Whoopers, which don’t reach

sexual maturity until they are about
5 years old, have a complex mating
ritual. They form “pair bonds” after
about two or three years of associa-
tion on the winter grounds and stay
with the same mate for life. After
pairing, they establish territories,
which they defend from other
cranes.

On the winter grounds, they may
perform mating dances that help
strengthen theﬂbond between them.

“The male and female will h0p
in the air, spread their wings and
bow their necks as they hop,” Stehn
said. “It’s kind of a leaping and
bowing, and of course, they’re call-
ing as they do this. It’s quite a spec-
tacular dance.”

The whooper is a tall bird,
reaching a height of 5 feet, with a
typical wingspan of 7 feet. It’s feath-
ers are solid white, with black legs
and feet, and black wing tips that
can be seen only in flight. It has a
red patch on its head and black
cheeks.

The birds have keen senses of
Sight, smell and hearing and are ex-
tremely wary of man. They eat just
about anything —- blue crabs, small
snakes and fish, crayfish, clams,
berries, acorns, corn, wheat, barley
and many other small animals and
plants.

They can fly at dizzying heights
during migration, usually at 1,000 to
2,000 feet, but they have been mea-

sured as high as 10,000 feet.

They are intelligent and highly
territorial. “They won’t tolerate hu~
mans approaching them at all,”
Stehn said.

The only breeding population in
the wild now has 130 birds. That
colony, which dwindled to 15 in
1941, spends its winters on the Gulf
Coast at the Arkansas refuge. Each
April, the birds make the 2,500-mile

flight to Wood Buffalo National

Park in Canada’s Northwest Territo-
ry to breed.

The flock had a banner mating
season this year. Thirty-two pairs of
birds produced 25 chicks. “That’s a
new record since the turn of the
century,” Lewis said. .

The only other colony of whoop-
ers is at Patuxent Center for Endan-
gered Wildlife Research in Mary-
land, where 41 birds are kept in
captivity to produce eggs. The colo-
ny has produced about 200 eggs
since the program started in 1967.
Two other whoopers are in captivi-
ty. one at the San Antonio, Texas,
zoo and one at the International
Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.

The Florida experiment, if ap-
proved, would attempt to establish a
non-migratory colony of whoopers,
Nesbitt said.

“Even if they’re genetically mi-
gratory, we’re betting they can
learn not to migrate,” Nesbitt said.
“We know that it works.”

Until the late 1940s, there was a
tion—migratory flock of whoopers in
Louisiana. But the colony fell to six ;
birds and then was wiped out by a
hurricane. The last remaining
whooper in Louisiana was captured
in 1949.

Florida officials are basing their
proposal on a study they did on
Florida sandhill cranes beginning in
1980. The purpose of the study was
to show that migration was a
learned rather than genetically de—
termined behavior.

Biologists put eggs and chicks
from migratory sandhill cranes into ‘
the nests of non-migratory sandhill .
cranes. They attached radio trans-
mitters to the chicks to see if they
would migrate, or if they would fol-
low their foster parents behavior
and stay in the same area.

"The results were that the birds
we followed did not migrate,” Nesc
bitt said.

Even if Georgia or Michigan is
chosen for the next colony of
whoopers, Florida may end up get-
ting the birds at least part of the
year.

If the site in the upper Michigan
peninsula is picked, the whoopers
most likely would follow their foster
parents —- the sandhills —~ to Flori-
da every winter. If the Okefenokee
Swamp in Georgia is chosen, some
of the birds eventually could end up
living in Florida.

Gifts are out in force this
Christmas season in an effort to
save the very animals they depict.
Among them are Kemp’s Ridley
sea turtles and our domestic dogs
and cats.

First on the list comes from
HEART (Help Endangered Ani-
mals —- Ridley Turtles), a non-
profit organization which is offer-
ing a variety of items ranging
from turtle-imprinted tote bags
($8) and turtle-shaped pillows
($9) to turtle-shaped cookie cut-
ters with a recipe for Raisin’ Rid-
ley Cookies ($5), t-shirts ($10)
and miniature framed turtle paint-
ings ($10). Proceeds benefit Rid-
ley sea turtle conservation.

Schools andprganizations also
can help the turtles by forming a
HEART Council. To do so, indi-
viduals volunteer to show a
HEART video called, The Heart-
break Turtle; visit the turtle
houses of the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Galveston;
see a slide presentation on turtles;
write to their state legislators en-
couraging turtle conservation and
enforcement of laws to protect
them; and sponsor the feeding of
fsive turtle hatchlings at a cost of

Each HEART Council receives
a certificate, and a large, red heart
displaying the council’s name is
placed on a wall of the Galveston
turtle house. .

The HEART gifts are available
from the Piney Woods Wildlife
Society, North Harris County Col-

 

lege, PO. Box 681231, Houston,

If the rising number of abused
and abandoned animals upsets
you, take note. According to the
Humane Society of the United
States, at least half the dogs and
cats at shelters around the coun- '
try are given up because their
owners can’t or won’t care for
them.

So, in an effort to teach future
adults to value and care for their
animals, the Humane Society is
promoting a new line of stuffed
and cuddly canines and felines
that send a clear message about ,
animal care. ManufactUred by De-
termined Productions of San
Francisco, each plush pet bears
the national humane organiza-
tion’s logo and is accompanied by
a booklet explaining proper pet
care and the importance of taking
responsibility for pets.

The stuffed toys, available at
department, Specialty and toy
stores, depict a variety of breeds,
including gold and gray tabbies
and persians, cocker spaniels, col-
lies and scotties, and range from
$15 to $60. A portion of each pur-
chase price is donated to the Hu-

ATLANTA JOURNAL G CONSTITUTION - December 21, 1987

US. will require shrimp fishermen

to use devices to protect sea turtles

By Jeff Nesmith

Journal-Constitution Washington Bureau

,' WASHINGTON —— After several
years of debate and a delay ordered
' by Congress, the government early
next year will make shrimp fisher-
men install equipment designed to

protect threatened and endangered

sea- turtles from drowning in nets.

' -The House last week voted over-
whelmingly against a two-year mor-
atorium on regulations requiring
theequipment, known as turtle ex-
cluder devices (TEDs). Those voting

against the delay included Rep. '

Lindsay Thomas (D-Screven), who
earlier in the year sponsored a
hearing on the devices in his South
Georgia district.

Shrimpers in Georgia and other '

states have criticized the devices,
saying they cost too much, out down
on catches and are of questionable
beneﬁt for the turtle population.

Environmentalists say the de-
vices, which are designed to deflect
large turtles from net openings, are
necessary to save more than 10,000
loggerhead and Kemp’s ridley tur-
tles from drowning each year in
nets shrimpers drag on the sea
floor.

An intense lobbying campaign

over efforts to extend a moratorium ,
on implementation of the regula--

tions had pitted environmentalists
against the shrimping interests.

A coalition of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida
members had pushed an amend-
ment to delay the TED regulations
for two years. They argued that the
requirements would cost each
shrimp boat between $30,000 and
$45,000 a year in lost catch.

Proponents of the delay also ar-
gued that estimates of the number
of turtles killed in shrimp nets each
year were not reliable. .

The House voted 270147 against
the delay Thursday.

During a lengthy debate, two
representatives whose constituents
include many shrimp fishermen,
Thomas and Rep. Arthur Ravenel
(R-S.C.) argued against further de-
lay in requiring the devices.

“When sea turtles are killed in
shrimp nets, it is by accident,”
Thomas said on the House floor.
“The turtles are trapped, held un-
derwater and drowned without the

 

-;shrimper being aware Of What has"
,‘happened. But if we pass this
,gamendment it will not be an ac-
‘L’ci‘dent. We will be doing it with our
eyes-wide open. We will be doing it

with the certain knowledge that
when we talk about saving an en-
dangered species, we do not mean
business.”

Thomas said the TED regulation
has been “studied, reviewed, pro-
posed, withdrawn, modiﬁed, tested,
delayed, compromised and retest-
ed” for 10 years. ‘

HHe said that his constituents in-

' clude “all of the shrimpers of Geor-

gia”_an'd that many of them already
were using TEDs. -
“Sea turtles don’t vote,” he said.

._..._..-.._._.___....A ......». .._._——.._ .

“They are not pretty. Their destruc-
tion goes on out of our sight. No
_ ﬁsherman kills them on purpose. It

happens by accident.”

He warned that the moratorium
amendment, which was introduced
by Rep. Solomon Ortiz (D-Texas)
would start the Endangered Species
Act unraveling.

Loggerhead turtles, which can
grow to several hundred pounds,
are not listed as “endangered” spe-
cies by the Department of Interior,
but as “threatened,” a less severe
category. '

Kemp’s ridley turtles, which
only reach about 100 pounds, are
considered among the 12 most en-

dangered animals in America.

The National Marine Fisheries

:Service has announced a schedule

3that will require Gulf of Mexico
shrimpers from Clearwater, Fla,
south to start using TEDs early next
month.

Regulations would phaSe in the
requirements for other Gulf and
South Atlantic areas by May 1. The
devices have been required on a
small area of Florida’s Atlantic
Coast, near Cape Canaveral, for sev-
eral months.

Shrimpers who fail to use the
devices could face federal fines of
more than $10,000 and conﬁscation
’“of their boats.

Poachers stalk African chimps

43y LlSANNE RENNER
Orlando Sentinel
For every African chimpanzee that
makes it to a research laboratory, five
to 10 others had to die, conservationists
estimate.
‘Po snatch a baby from its mother —-
«and infants are what labs want ~—
poachers often shoot the mother and

any other group members who try to'

pretect her. Sometimes they poison
food, which kills entire groups except
far nursing infants. At other times
chimps fall and break their neCks while
being chased by hunters and packs of
dogs.

“‘"‘ Once caught, chimps can sit in
' crates on an airport tarmac in the hot
African sun for as long as a day,
sometimes dying of heat exhaustion
and dehydration.

.. African countries suCh as Sierra
Leone, where half the world’s lab

poaching continues

“Most of the trade that is leaving
Africa is illegal, ” said Geza Teleki, a
Washington-based primate expert who

5-10 die for each one sold, some say

directed Sierra Leone’s Outamba-Ki-
limi National Park from 1980 to 1984.
Laws in Africa “don’t work'the way
they do in the United States,” Teleki
said. “Everything has a way around it
by paying off the right ofﬁCials and
doctoring doCuments.”

Teleki is Chairman of the Commit-
tee ior the Conservation and Care of
Chimpanzees, a group of 30 scientists
— among them primatologist Jane

Goodall — who were organized 13’

months ago to address concerns about
Chimps in Captivity and in AfriCan

of Muckle, is normally
well stocked with birds
and much in demand by
visitors (giving rise to the
old phrase ‘ Where there’s
Muckle, there’s brass ’).

But the owner, the Earl of
Leven, noticed that there
were fewer birds to kill than
usual L- no joke when you
charge rich Americans and
Germans £1,000 a gun to
shoot them.

Unable to vent his frustra-
tion on the birds themselves,
the Earl did the next best
thing -— and vented it on
another animal, an innocent
dog -- behaviour which last
week landed him in court and
brought him Parliamentary
ignominy.

The animal, a five-year-old
Scots terrier called Eilidh,
was out walking with her
young master, 16-year-old
Andrew Mitchell. She spied
the Earl and, in the way that
dogs normally do, rushed up
wagging her tail in greeting.
But, in the way that humans
normally don’t, the Earl

dog’s skull with his walking
stick.

The blow was so fierce that
the Earl’s stick broke in two.
The same fate nearly befell
the dog’s skull, which was
fractured, and its owner
carried Eilidh home.

'Last week, the Earl, a
governor of Gordonstoun
school and Lord Lieutenant
of Nairnshire, was fined £75
at Inverness Sheriff’s Court
for ‘ cruel ill-trtatment.’ The
Sheriff said he would limit
the penalty, which can carry
a sentence of six months
imprisonment, ‘ in view of the

 

 

fact that he is a first
offender ’ (it is, after all, not
the sort of thing you do
twice).

After the trial, it became
the turn of the Earl to be
beaten with a large stick.
More than 40 Opposition
MPs have signed a House of
Commons Motion demanding
that he is ‘stripped of all
public offices ’ and deploring
his ‘ lenient sentence,’ fearing
it will not deter any other
hooligan peers.

Labour MP Brian Wilson
has even written to the Queen
as ‘a fellow animal lover.‘
The Queen has not made her
reply known —- Buckingham
Palace said it was ‘ a private
matter’——but it is safe to
assume she was not amused.

The dog has now recovered
but suffers from occasional
blurred vision. Her owner
says that after her experience
she is now ‘timid and wary
of strange people.’ The same
can be said of the Earl after
his acquisition of a criminal
record. Speaking from his
home, Glenferness House, his
only comment was a wary

j "The ﬁlly is one of about 200
mustangs rounded up on the plains
of the West and brought to New
Mexico’s Los Lunas (Correctional
Center, a minimum-security prison
often referred to as an honor farm.

The horses are kept behind steel
bars in adobe corrals, where they
stand with feral looks in their eyes,
their noses quivering, awaiting the

next supply of oats and hay. They
- have had minimal ,contact with
humans, and they are skittish.

Van Fossen lives next door at the
medium-security Central New Mex-

opened, and Van Fossen and about.

30 other inmates are released for
work detail. ,

The work brings the inmates and
the horses together.

The Bureau of Land Manage-
ment is hoping the horses can be
tamed enough that someone will
adopt them. The Corrections De

Horse and inmate spend about
three weeks together, their mis-

can wear a halter, be led, lift their
hooves for cleaning and interact
with humans. The horses then are
put up for adeption under the
bureau’s Wild Horse and Burro

Upon the inmates’ arrival at the

fails to find
escaped pet

LEBANON, Tenn. (AP) — Au-
thorities in Middle Tennessee
continued to search yesterday
for an 80-pound pet cougar that
escaped from a cage two days
earlier while being transported
from Watertown to Nashville.

Wilson County Sheriff Terry
Ashe said Couga, a 11/2-year-old
male, is not considered danger-

ous but could be frightened into
aggressive behavior.

“I don’ 1 think he’s the kind of
animal you’d like to go up to and
say, ‘Kitty, kitty, kitty,’ ” Ashe
said He urged anyone who
sights the light brown animal to
call authorities immediately in-
stead of trying to catch him
without assistance.

“These people that own this
animal are real good people and
know how to take care of their
animals. If we can get him sight-
ed and get these people to the

area, I m pretty sure we can just ,

call him (Couga) in,’ ’Ashe said.
Couga escaped Thursday from
acage inside a horse trailer
between Watertown and Nash-

ville while its owner, Mike Stu- .

art of Watertown, was driving to
the veterinarian ’5 office to pick
up the cougar’s health certifi-
cate, said Stuart’s wife, Penny.

Mrs. Stuart said the cougar
was to be taken to Missouri for
an auction. ‘

“He came out of a moving
trailer,” she said. “It’s a good pos-
sibility that the cat’s injured.”

One sighting was reported
Thursday night in Wilson Coun-
ty, but a search of that area on
Friday morning yielded no clues
about the cat’s whereabouts, au-
thorities said.

Metro Nashville police offi-
cers, the Tennessee Highway Pa-
trol, the Tennessee Wildlife Re-
sources Agency and the Wilson
. County Sheriff’s Department
were on the lookout yesterday.

“He’s really not a dangerous
animal, but he’s like any other
animal that may be confused,”
Ashe said “He might become
aggressive. He’s lived by hu-
mans feeding him and may show
up at the back of somebody’ s
porch wanting a chicken.

Commission revises rules

for taking of alligators

By JOEL POILEY
Tribune Sports Writer

TAMPA — Twenty years ago the
alligator was listed as endangered.
Today, with over a million spread
across Florida, according to Vic
Heller," DivisiOn of Wildlife assistant
director, alligators 'now threaten

‘ man’s safety.

. For that reason, along with mak-
ing the best use of alligators as a

. natural resource, the Florida Game

and Fresh Water Fish Commission
has revised alligator hunting rules.
“Alligators were prohibited from

; being caught in the mid-60$ because

their population was down and they

were scarce in several parts of Flor-
; ida,” Heller said from his Tallahas-
see office. “By the mid-70s, howev-
5; er, the alligator population started
to recover and in 1977 the state in.
troduced a nuisance law concerning
; trapping alligators and selling the
2. hides and meat.

. “As the alligator population con-
tinued to grow, in 1987 the legisla-
ture drafted a state-wide manage-
ment program regarding the
trapping of adult alligators, hatch-
lings and eggs.”

At a recent commission meeting,
several existing rules were revised
to go with state-wide legislative
changes.

One rule change requires nui-

sance alligator trappers to purchase

a $250 annual licenses and $30 hide
validation tags. The rule also allows
trappers to sell the hides of nui-
sance alligators and keep all pro-
ceeds.

A nuisance alligator must be at
least 4-feet long and present a dan-
ger to humans, pets or liVestock.

Previously, the commission sold
the hides and returned 70 percent

. of the profits to trappers.

“Because of our expanding pro-
gram state-wide, all anyone has to
have to hunt alligators is the $250
license,” Heller said. “The $30 hide
validation fee is to prestude illegal

trafficking of the hides liieeuse at

$30-40 a running foot (approximate-

ly 10 feet of the hide equals a run-

ning foot) they are very valuable.”
Previously, the hides could only

, be sold at commission sanctioned

es. With the relaxed rule, Heller
said, anyone having a validation tag
can sell a hide.

.The Commission used to hold
only three or four sanctioned sales

' a year. But in an effort to stimulate

sales of alligator products, Heller
said eight or nine will be held next
year across the state.

Another rule change allows alli-
ator farmers to make commercial

#5

use of juvenile alligators which Edge
of natural causes.

“There are only 30-40 alligator
farmers in the state,” Heller said
“What use to happen when there
was a fatal accident involving arrai-
ligator was that there often was no
time to get a permit. That increased
the infant mortality rate of ailme-
tors because of the unreportéd
deaths. .

“With this rule, the commercial
farmer can still use the hide, he just
has to let the commission know
about what he’ 5 doing. ”

A third rule change allows remit
stores to sell alligator products with-

out having to purchase a $100 annu-

al license. It also prohibits the we

of stuffed baby crocodilia. . *

T.

“In the past, any merchant in
the state who sold alligator products
like purses, shoes and belts had to
purchase the $100 license,” Heller
said. “Now, virtually anyone'can :
deal in procelsed alligator products
as long as they have a license to do
so. *~

“Basically, the license was shift-
ed to include anyone who deals'in
alligator products.”

Heller said the sale of stuffed
baby crocodilia, those of one to two
feet, has always been prohibited.

“It’s a waste of a resource,” he
said. “And people always have a
problem with killing baby animals
of any kind.”

The shoe has been reversed in
recent years, however, as alligators
have become a greater threat to
man. Heller said there were seven

A alligator attacks reported in the

state last year with one fatality.
That’s in addition to thousands of
alligator complaints.

“What’s at work here are two
things,” he said. “With more alliga-
tors around, more people are mov-
ing into occupied alligator habitat.

“Also, gators are older, bigger
and can inﬂict more damage. Most
attacks have come when people fed
alligators because they associate
food with humans. When people are
feeding alligators you’re bound to
have trouble.” ‘

Among other rules to be recom-
mended for approval by the com-
mission at its Jan. 15 meeting are:

0 State-wide licensing require-
ments for trapping and harvesting
of alligators.

o The establishment of an elli-
gator management program on pri-
vately owned wetlands.

0 Revisions governing the sale
of alligator meat and products.

0 How to tag and document alli-
gator hides before theyare sold.

Aim to guard

Moo moo black sheep, have you
any wool? No sir, no sir, because
I’m a cow.-

Or at least I think I am.

Blame the confusion on scien-
tists. Dean Anderson and Clarence,
Hulet are trying to make lambs
think cows are their parents.

They have a good reason for try-
ing to bond lambs to cattle. They’re
hoping the hefty elders will guard
their foster children against attacks
from coyotes.

”The bumper sticker that says,
‘Eat lamb, 10,000 coyotes can’t be
wrong,’ is not a figment of the
imagination, as we found out,” An-
derson says.

On the other hand, coyotes usu-
ally stear clear of cows. ‘

“In my opinion, cattle have an“

innate dislike for canines, whether
it's a coyote or a dog that's working .
them,” Anderson says. “They will
lower their heads and snort and
kick at them.

. “We saw this type of behavior
and thought that if a sheep would
stick next to a cow, then a coyote
would not do its damage.”

Hulet says the researchers want
to find out what happens with larg—

“There are a lot of other ques—
tions,” he adds. ”We want to make
bonding as efficient as we possnbly
can. We need to know what the

she spreads her 6—foot wingspan high above his

the bird's fiercely regal appearance.

”At 13 pounds. Keneu is the largest of Lucius' rap-
tors. He does not ”own” her: he has her on loan from
the US Fish and Wildlife Service. an arrangement
made necessary by a law forbidding citizens to keep

_, Despite her injury. she is a stunningly impressive
bird. Lucius regards her. and golden eagles generally.
as, the most intelligent of airborne predators. far
brighter. he feels. than the so-called “wise old owl."

.j'._"“At home." he tells audiences. “I have a stockade
fence and Keneu follows me around the yard. Her fa-
vorite toy is a football helmet. which she‘ll pick up
with her beak and toss into the air. then pounce on it
with her huge talons as if it's alive." With such anec-
ddtes Lucius personalizes each of the four raptors he
shows. The female prairie falcon. whom he has
named Sioux. he calls his “fine-feathered fiend.”
after her ill-tempered disposition and general dislike
of ‘people. During most of his presentation he keeps
the falcon hooded on her perch. a precaution neces-
sary to control her excitability. While the hood covers
her eyes. however. she remains so calm and quiet
that audiences frequently mistake her for a mounted
specimen - an illusion that is quickly dispelled when
me hood is removed.

'f‘Although Lucius has had no formal training in
teaching. he is a natural. At 63. he enthralls his lis—
tehers with accOunts of the birds‘ hunting prowess:
the prairie‘falcon's lOO-mph dive and its ability to
pltick smaller birds out of the air: the golden eagle's
employment. over the snows of Russia. in the hunt-
ing of wolves: the owl‘s splendid night vision and its
keen hearing: the ability of raptors to turn their
heads a full 180 degrees. Even in assemblies of a
hundred plus elementary students. Lucius manages
to ‘keep the interest of his audiences focused sharply
on his birds of prey.

-" 'He also links the birds to America's past. especial-
ly the significance eagles had for the American Indi-
an. He‘tells of the lndians‘ belief. as they watched the
great birds circling u‘pwards into invisibility. that ea—
gles rose into the sky 'to speak with gods: and with
the use of richly decorated shields of buffalo hide and
an eagle-feather headdress (its 68 feathers were gath-
ered from Keneu‘s annual molting and fashioned
into a headdress by a friend). he explains the use In—

dians made of eagle'feathers as emblems of their own

courage and strength.

Lucius says his interest in raptors goes back to a
time when he was 15 and he and his father found a .
red-tailed hawk with a broken wing.

“We took him home." he recounts. ”and I took
care of ‘him. That first bird eventually died. but he
made an impression on me I find hard to explain.
From the time we found that bird 1 was fascinated by
raptors. I read everything i could find about them
and when i got out of the Marines I began learning
falconry. The rest. rehabilitating injured birds. shar-
ing what i had learned about them with others. that
followed naturally from my early fascination."

Lucius says he still hunts with hawks occasional-
ly. but he has turned most of his attention to educat-
ing others about birds of 'prey. Part of his interest is
preservation. By the 19605 all raptors. including
owls. could claim state and federal protection nation—
wide. but still the birds were trapped. poisoned and
shot. The breeding cycles of some species had been
upset by pesticides like DDT: many of the birds suf-
fered from habitat destruction. .

Yet another threat lay in the fact that many peo-
ple saw predatory birds as marauders. little better
than winged thugs intent ,on the pillage of chicken
yards. “Until recently." Lucius observes. ”even bird
reference books divided them up into ‘good‘ and ‘bad'
birds. and-the ‘bad‘ guys. like the Cooper‘s hawks
and goshawks. got hit with a lot of abuse. Raptors
aren't wanton killers or moral degenerates. but su—
perbly adapted hunters with a niche to fill in na-
ture."

Despite his feelings. Lucius brings no message to
his presentations other than what the birds make for
themselves. It is the beauty of the birds he empha-
sizes. that and their prowess as hunters doing what
comes naturally. He calls his lectures “a capsule
look. a mere glimpse at the splendor of the bird." Yet
every once in a while he gets personal letters from
students or from adults that make it clear he‘s left a
lasting impression behind.

That‘snot surprising. for his lectures are impres—
sive. His affection for the birds is obvious. as is the

. respect he has for them. partly because of their sharp

talons and beaks. but also for the birds as represen—
tatives of freedom in a wild state. He has established
a solid relationship with them.

Spooky. the great horned owl he‘s had from infan-
cy. could not hoot. For a long time all she could do
was make a chittering sound. what Lucius called her
“baby noises." To remedy that. and to teach her to
produce the customary ”hoot" that we associate
with owls. he recorded a tape of owls hooting and
played it hour after hour for Spooky. Within a few
days. Spooky could hoot along with the best of the
owls recorded on the tape.

The rapport that has developed between Keneu
and Lucius makes her one of the very few eagles any-
wherein the country that can be displayed closeup to
an audience. ‘

Lucius says that sometimes his lectures are a lot
like work and he is eSpecially weary of traveling. but
he never gets tired of sharing his birds. “I‘ll keep on,
doing it. l guess. until it gets boring. but that still
hasn't happened. When it does." he adds. grinning.
“well. i guess I‘ll retire for real. But not yet.”

 

 

 




BOSTON GLOBE - December 14, 1987

i A gentle champion for birds Of prey

Dick Lucius has an easy rapport with the powerful predators

By Richard Matthews
Special to the Globe

Dick Lucius is a Master Falconer. He is also a self—
made teacher. a former Springfield firefighter who has
devoted a large part of his retirement to telling people
about raptors. or birds of prey —- the very image of the
wild heart of nature.

But Lucius doesn’t just tell people about raptors. he
lets them see for themselves. When he hits the road.
traveling all over New England lecturing to school
groups. civic clubs and other organizations. he's accom-
panied by four very-much-alive birds. powerful pred-
ators armed with hooked beaks. and dagger—like talons.
Handling them requires caution (as well as a heavy cow-
hide glove). His fellow-travelers are a great horned owl. a
falcon. a red-tailed hawk and a magnificent golden eagle
named Keneu. which means War Eagle in the Amer-
indian language of Algonquin.

For nearly 40 years Lucius has used his spare time re—
habilitating injured birds of prey. as well as training
them for falconry. Some years ago he became a Master
Falconer. one of only five people in Massachusetts to at—
tain top rank in the sport. But he decided he wanted to
share his hobby and to see what he could do to combat
the bad press predatory birds have received. The result

was an educational success beyond his hopes: His lec-
tures rapidly caught on and now he visits more than 50
schools and organizations a year. Last year. in the
Springfield area alone. he lectured at 22 schools under a
state science grant to show elementary students the
birds he regards as friends.

“Friends" is no exaggeration. for Lucius has estab-
lished a rapport with these often-irascible birds that is
rare even among longtime bird handlers. With Spooky.
his great horned owl. the relationship came easily: Since
she’s been with Lucius from infancy. she is imprinted to
him. which means she regards him as her own kind. Be-
cause of this relationship. he can safely handle a

8Guests put on the dog
for a celebration banquet
at Famous F ido’s deli

 

By Victoria Lautman

 

efore every banquet, there’s

that moment of panic that

grips even the most seasoned

hostess. Will the guests arrive

on time? Will they like the
food? Will they be properly at-
tired? Seating arrangements must
be impeccable—god forbid you
should put two guests together
who are simply going to . .. well,
snarl at each other throughout the
party.

Gloria Lissner was pondering
-Such possibilities when the 14 par-
ticipants of her graduation celebra-
tion began to arrive. You could
"tell they were real party animals--
excited, hungry and decked out in
their festive best. But like lots of
banquet patrons, they began to get
itntsy when seating wasn’t immedi—
ate, and soon they were whining
with displeasure.

‘Suddenly, one hairy beast began
it) rudely eat the decorations, and
i issner quickly began serving din-
ner: steak and kidney ragout ap-
qoetizers followed by a healthful
meat~loaf entree, then “pupcakes”
with liver mousse for dessert. Ad-
mittedly not everyone’s menu of
choice, it was a big hit at the ban-
quet, held to celebrate the end of
an obedience course at the Nor—
iridge Dog Training School.
Lissner, president of Famous
lFido’s Doggie Deli Inc., is used to
catering to canines. Her recently
i pened pet emporium at 1533 W.
l evon Ave. (affectionately referred
1:0 as 1 Pet Plaza) offers every
imaginable product and service for
pets and pet owners alike, from
liroomfing and boarding to clothing
1 11d g1fts
" The department store atmo~
éphere of Famous Fido’ s is estab-
Fished even before you enter, with
jazzy music piped fiom candy-
Striped awnings above the
sidewalks whe1e bemused window-
shoppers ogle the offerings: an
array of Specially designed pet
wear, including tuxedos, sweaters,
hats, scarves and snowsuits, all
from the store’s boutique.

" A selection of stuffed toys, cards
and ceramic sculptures from the
gift department draws its share of

 

attention, along with some elabo-
rately decorated cakes—one of
Lissner’s specialties—that range in
price from $12 to $75. Like other
enticing deli products lining the
glass cases and trays, the cakes
have been known to tempt
humans but are filled with liver,
cheese, garlic and other pet-pre-
ferred ingredients.

Fun with food

Special red and green holiday
cookies in the form of bells, trees
and wreaths w'ouldn’t be out of
place at the office party, except
for their pungent aroma that
makes them so appealing to four—
legged friends.

Surveying her sprawling domain
devoted entirely to the notion of
pet—hood, Famous Fido’s 35—year-
old founder and president ex-
plained that she tried to create a
fun environment for both pets and
owners.

“Sure, plenty of people think
I’m crazy, and I admit the party
aspect is a little kooky, but there’s
a very serious side to the whole
Famous Fido concept that has to
do with teaching people how to
care for their pets, particularly
where nutrition is concerned.” .

Lissner, who has been in the pet
industry for 17 years, handed ove1
a couple of printed menus—one
for cats and one for dogs—that
grace the tables where pets are fed
special, delectable, but healthy din—
ners. Chicken a la Fido Tuna
Cat Casserole Muttley Meat-
balls.

“Don’t they sound good? We
only use fresh ingredients and ab-
solutely no sugar or salt,” said
Lissner, who tries out recipes on
her own two dogs and eat.

it has taken Lissner seven years
of hard work to get the first Fa-
mous Fido’s Doggie Deli off the
ground, and she has come a long
way from the days of baking muz-
lie-smacking treats in her own
kitchen. Now she works with nu~
tritionists, veterinarians and con—
sumer awareness consultants who
help her develop the 200 pet prod—
ucts she plans to offer nationally,
from frozen dinners to Pet-O—
Grams.

That’s right; now your pet can
send a message and a bucket of
treats to someone else’s pet, any-
where in the country.

it’s businesslike

Besides the zaniness and dedica-
tion of Lissner’s endeavor, there’s
a hefty business future to consider.
Franchise applications will be ac-
cepted starting next year, and
there are already 3,000 requests.
Can anyone with a love of furry
creatures get in on the action?
Nope.

“We’re not going to let every
applicant open 3 Famous Fido’s
just because they’re pet lovers,”
Lissner said. “I know it all seems
so cute and wonderful, but it’s a
very complicated business, and
every franchise operator has to
work here for a year. They really
have to learn the health and nutri—
tion part. .

While Lissner is explaining her
burgeoning empire, there’s a little
ruckus ovei at the banquet table,
wheie Pugie is trying to steal
Chief’s bowl of crackeis. Both
poochcs—~a pug and a black La-
brador——are wearing feathenhats
and appear perfectly at ease Sitting
on a bench, eating from the usual-
ly verboten tabletop. .

“Pugie’s been to other parties
here and adores the food,” sa1d
owner Ursula Asbury. “in fact, last
time we came, she wouldn’t eat

 

her regular food for a week, she
got so spoiled. But I have to watch
and make sure she doesn’t overdo
it, or else she’ll eat till she’s sick.”

Sitting with the bigger dogs at
the end of the table, Gunna, a
grolden retriever, is happily lapping

rom his water bow slobbering
over his plastic bib.

“He thoroughly enjoyed the last
party we attended; so now his cars
go up whenever I mention
Gloria,” said Pam Kraus, who
added that the parties are “a cute
idea. lt’ 5 nice to spoil your pet o_c-
casionally, and the food is
healthy.” Havin sated his thirst,
Gunna turns his attention to a
liver- -topped pupcake, which disap-
pears in two bites.

After about an how of festivi-
ties, the dishes are cleared away
and a resident boarder of Famous
Fido’s 10 pet kennel is pressed
into service, reluctantly carrying in
the bill to the restless horde. For
$8 each, these newly obedient
graduates had partied, dined and
socialized.

And if this group was any indi-
cation, canines are better behaved
than youi average pack of partying
adults When they left the table
and headed for the d001, each
barked his or her goodbyes, pre—
sumably hoping for anothe1 such
occasion soon. And each was ca1-
lying a “people bag” full of lelt~
overs.

Human, pet problems are inseparable

,ﬁ/or/srm/ 7%5'7‘
mat/«- 87

Animal welfare workers are sensitive to the needs of all creatures great and small

lengthy, well~written letter which clearly ex-
emplifies one of animal welfare’s biggest
problems.

The writer, obviously knowledgeable, elaborated
extensively about the necessity and value of animal
welfare programs in our community. But, as the let—
ter progressed in length, the original theme vanished
as the writer shifted into an entirely different subject
area.

“I admire your dedication, but why waste your
lives working to support dumb animals that do not
have souls?" the writer asked. "Wouldn’t your efforts
be more meaningful if you worked to correct people
problems?" the writer concluded.

These are not unusual questions as many people,
particularly those having little (if any) appreciation
for animals, will use this trend of thought especially
as they are approached for a contribution or support
to help sustain an animal welfare activity. My re-
sponse is always the same. “Isn’t the welfare and hu-
mane treatment of animals a people problem also?” I
ask. “If you don’t think so, then please tell me whose
problem it is."

History tells us that each phase of humankind's de-
velopment has generated a multitude of enviom-
mental changes -— some good and some not so
good. With each change the balance of nature was al-
tered in some way.

When humankind first domesticated dogs, cats
and other animals, it was considered a progressive
environmental change. However, like many other al—
terations of nature, significant problems developed as
humans have made their domesticated animals total-
ly subservient and dependent upon them for total
survival.

There's nothing wrong with this dependency if the
human would assume the responsibility for this prob-
lem and cease being a continuous contributor to dog/
cat overpopulation which eventually develops into
animal cruelty of various barbaric forms. The de-
struction of more than 20 million dogs and cats an-
nually in the United States by animal control and wel-
fare agencies is a sound testimonial of human
irresponsibility. These animals are destroyed simply
because there are too many of them and not enough
quality homes to care for them.

Several weeks ago the Houston SPCA received a

Yes, animal welfare problems are primarily “peo-
ple problems.” Created by people, sustained by peo-
ple and, unfortunately, often ignored by people.

The thousands of dedicated animal welfare em—
ployees, volunteers, contributors, educators, investi-
gators, and board members are not ignorant of the
numerous “other" people problems that exist in to-
day’s society. They fully comprehend the value of
their mission as their priorities of service are directed
toward the animals of the community who have been
forgotten by the human who was anxious to domesti-
cate them in the first place.

“Animals don't have souls" is a very sensitive
comment We heard stated often. Obviously, an an-
swer based on scientific data as to whether animals
have souls or not isn't available. In my opinion, each
person must search his or her spiritual beliefs along
with their knowledge of, and compassion for animals
to determine if animals do or do not have souls.

To me, it’s a personal belief and every individual is
entitled to an opinion. We always believed that ani-
mals do have souls and, although different from hu-
man beings, animals are certainly not beyond the
love of God. Many of my closest friends are members
of the clergy, and we’ve discussed this subject often.
Needless to say, many of our discussions were super-
saturated with deep theological concepts combined
with my thoughts of animalia. Usually we all agreed
that God’s love does include animals in some way.

There are a few things in life, such as love, which
we know exists, but are difficult to specifically ex—
plain. ! consider the term “soul” in this category. Ev-
eryone probably has a different concept of the mean-
ing of soul. I consider it all of a being except the
physical.

Character and personality are integral components
of the soul. With this concept, I can truthfully attest to

 

 

More than 20 million dogs and cats are
destroyed annually in the United States by

having known and currently know animals that I be-
lieve have the finest kind of soul.

All across the world today, there are thousands of
people whose only love and affection is derived from
an animal pet. As sad as this may sound, it’s true. l'm
certain each of you know someone who fits into this
category. Therefore, isn’t this manifestation of love a
genuine expression of character and personality? I
believe it is and that’s what soul is all about.

To the person who took time to write the Houston
SPCA, I leave you with five thoughts: one, we appre—
ciate hearing from you and to know that you do un-
derstand some things about the humane movement;

animal control and welfare agencies be-
cause of human irresponsibility.

two, i can only feel pity for you as obviously have
never known the loyalty and love of an animal; three,
animal welfare workers are very sensitive to both an—
imal and people problems as we know the two are in-
separable; four, animals are not dumb — provide an
animal a comparable education as most humans re-
ceive and I believe you would have a different insight
on this; five, many people believe animals do have
souls and I am one of them.

To all of you and your critters, have a very merry
Christmas.

TAMPA —- Beyond the cypress

and pond apple trees, past thick pal-
mettos and slash pines, a sparrow
flees as a bulldozer motors through
the marshland mud.

Some call it tragic, the death
and displacement of Florida’s wild-1

life due to devempment. But build-
ers say the state’s booming popula-
» tion growth makes construction of
morehomes, offices and shopping
centers inevitable. Conflicts ‘ are
bound to occur.

Sometimes the animals win.
Sometimes they lose.

Endangered woodstorks lost out
last month when a circuit court
judge allowed the construction of a
1,249-foot television tower in the

birds’ flight path near Naples. Moray

bers of the National Audubon Soci-

ety called it a “tragedy for wood.
storks” because of the...» birds

, “any one area V‘ofigthe state or~ any
Red- cockaded woodpeckers on --
the other hand, won a skirmish in

diminishing populations.

September when a Florida develop-
er who shot two of the birds was
caught and fined a sobering
$300,000. He wanted to eliminate
the endangered woodpecker from
his property so he could build a
housing development on it. Other
nearby developments had pre—
served land for the birds.

The issue of Wildlife vs. develop-

ment looms large in Florida,.which

has orient the longest lists of threat-v.
‘, ened and endangered spec-hes in the
' nation. Florida has“ a combined total

of 148 species on the federal and

1§Stat93 endangered threatened and
speoial—concern hots. Some species,»

are on both the state and federal
lists. ,1 1
“One of the reasons pedple

come to Florida is because of its
. outdodrs, its natural environment ”
said Manley Fuller, president of the ‘1"

Florida Wildlife Federation.
“The proponents of grow, grow,

grow are short-sighted. The worst”

thing that can’ happen to Florida is

to wind up looking like New Jer— .
sey,” he said. “Surveysshow the.

population of Florida has atremen-

dous interest in wildlife. We muSt ‘

maintain fish and‘Wiidiife values.”

tiny beach mouse can stop its pow-
erful cranes and bulldozers. The
government planned to dredge Ma-
tanzas Inlet near St. Augustine until
scientists discovered a species of
mouse that lives only on three is-
lands nearby. The scientists believe
dredging will erode the island
beaches and thus wipe out the ro-
dents’ habitat. Now the scientists
are trying to place the mouse on the
federal endangered species list,
which would “absolutely prohibit”
the government’s plans. »

“Development is one of the pri-
mary factors contributing to habitat
loss,” said Don Wood, endangered
Species coordinator for the Florida
Game and Fresh Water Fish Com-
mission. “If it’s not the primary fac-
tor, it’s certainly among them.”
_ Not all developers, of course,
turn their backs on nature. Intelli-
gent developers realize the value of
wildlife and incorporate nature
preservation into their work, Fuller
said. >

In St. Petersburg, for instance,
the developer of what will be the
Tampa Bay area’s largest industrial
park agreed to set aside 51 acres
for a bald eagle’s nest and another
66 acres for wetlands preservation.

And at Tampa Palms, a large
residential development in north
Tampa, an ecologist spent two years
studying the habitat, identifying var-
ious species of plants and animals
and creating a plan to protect them.

About 50 percent of Tampa Palms’ .

,5,400 acres will be left undeveloped
for" wildlife, said ecologist Chuck
Courtney.

“It’s a Catch-22. You can’t have
all development with no wildlife,
and you can’t have all wildlife with
no development,” he said. “What’s
only now being realized in the mar-
ketplace is the value of forests in
the background. People want these
natural areas.”

Courtney, who is project manag-
er for Tampa Palms, said environ-
mentalists often are too quick to
blame developers for wildlife prob-
lems when in fact all residents must
shoulder some responsibility.

“Everybody lives somewhere,
and how many people are out im-
proving the wildlife situation of
their property?” he said. “It’s not
just developers. It’s all of us.”

Under Florida law, a “Develop-
ment of Regional Impact” such as
Tampa Palms and the industrial
park in St. Petersburg is required to
provide information about how the
project will affect wildlife and wet-
lands.

But if the project is smaller than

a DRI — and most developments "

are -- state officials often are pow-
erless to stop habitat devastation be-
cause no law requires developers to
report the effects their work will
have on animals.

“If it’s a Development of Region-
al Impact, there’s all kinds of legal
hoops they have to jump through to
get approval. We can tell them how

a'developmertt, should proceed so as
to not negatively impact an endan-
gered species, and planning coun-
cils can put that in the development
order,” Wood said. “It’s it’s not a
«DRI, then we have no bite. We have
no court case to lean on. When the
precedent is set, and it will be one
day, we want to win.”
. There are federal and state laws
‘ that prohibit the possession, harm-
' ing or molesting of endangered or
threatened species, Wood said, but
with so much development in Flori-
da, who’s going to know if a builder
destroys an eagle’s nest or kills a
family of gopher tortoises?

“We provide guidance and ad-
vice all the time on how a develop-
er should proceed to not negatively
affect an endangered or threatened
species,” he said. “But we don’t
have the manpower (to enforce it).
If a developer doesn’t follow our
guidelines, in most cases we never
know about it.” .

Scientists can’t predict with cer-
tainty the future consequences of
losing a woodpecker, tortoise or but-

eterfly species. But they say every
; time a species is lost, it disrupts the

entire food chains .. _,

According to researcher Edward
Wolf, who wrote “On the Brink of
Extinction: Conserving the Diversity
of Life,” the problem may be worse

" than we think. He believes up to

one-fifth of the world’s estimated 5
million species may be lost in the
next 20 to 30 years because of hu-
manity’s destruction of forests and
wetlands.

Lately the issue has become the
focus of a lawsuit in Alachua Coun-
ty. The county recently passed an
ordinance called the Cross Creek
Special Area Study, which protects
fish and wildlife habitats from de-
velopment. _'

Cross Creek, with a population

. of only 800 people, gained national

fame as the home of Pulitzer Prize-

, winning author Marjorie Kinnan
~ Rawlings, whose novels “The Year- -1

ling” and “Cross Creek” describe
the area’s pristine beauty.

But a group of landowners has
filed suit against the county, charg-
ing that the ordinance unreasonably
restricts their property rights.

The National Wildlife Federa-
tion and the Florida Wildlife Feder-
ation asked a judge to allow them to
become parties to the lawsuit, de-

fending the county ordinance as
hecessary to protect wildlife. The
request was denied, but is under ap-
peal.

“The primary threat to fish and
wildlife in Florida is loss and degra-
dation of habitat,” said David J.
White, an attorney for the National
Wildlife Federation. “Local land use
regulations designed to protect natu-
ral resources are an effective way
to preserve these resources for fu-
ture generations.”

E Courtney, as an ecologist work-
?ing for a developer, sees both sides

iof the issue. And he agrees regula-

itions and guidelines are needed.

“These laws and ordinances
'make us more attentive to what’s
good for wildlife,” he said. “The
end product ends up being better.
Most of us don’t tend to think of
screating or maintaining a wildlife

 

3, habitat, not because of any evilness.
but just not being conscious of it.”
i” Most developers today agree

that wildlife protection is important,
although the degree of protection
remains debatable. But in the end,
as one naturalist put it, what people
do to wildlife, they do to them-
?; selves.

Dolphin’s
sudden death

puzzles Zoo

The Milwaukee County Zoo still '-

had a medical mystery on its hands
Saturday afternoon. '

McDee, one of the two dolphins at
the Zoo, died Friday night. She had

an inflammation of her intestinal,

tract, but the cause is not yet known.

Results from tests of tissue samples

taken from her body are not expec-
ted to be completed for a few days.

Nugget, the second dolphin at the
Zoo, appeared to be in good health
Saturday, but the Zoo canceled all
dolphin shows for the weekend. Zoo
Director Gilbert Boese said shows
featuring Nugget. and a California sea
lion named Fernando were expected
to resume at 11 am. Monday.

Kevin Walsh, vice president of
Zoovet Productions Inc., which pro-
vided the dolphins to the Zoo for the
summer, said that other tests found
no bacteria in the dolphin pool and

that the general quality of the water,

to which salt was added, was good.

Boese said that before the deli?

phins arrived here from Duck Key,

Fla.. on May 15, their Mllwaukee~

pool was swept, vacuumed and
washed with an antiseptic detergent.
The detergent was used to protect

the water from any harmful organ-y

isms and eliminate any foreign
objects that a dolphin might swal-
low. The pooi also has been vacu-
umed daily.

A post-mortem examination per-
formed at the Zoo Friday night did
not reveal any foreign matter in
McDee's body, Boese said. However,

The 200’s remaining dolphin, Nogget, came out of the water to greet Kevin Walsh

he added that at this point he could
not rule out the possibility of micro-
scopic perforations of the dolphin’ s
intestines that might have led to an
infection.

Walsh said it was difficult to esti-
mate the value of a dolphin like
McDee. A dolphin Jithout training

would be worth about $10,000, he

said. But McDee, captured off the

Glraffe love
high 1n air
at wedding

United Press International

GULF BREEZE— Two giraffes
kept 111 separate stalls at a zoo will
live together full time after they tie
the knot at a ceremony scheduled
. for today.

. Pat Quinn, director of The Zoo in
Gulf Breeze, said 12-foot-tall Gus
and 9-foot-tall Gigi will be married
in a 15-minute “wedding” this af-
ternoon. A reception -— for human
guests only —- will follow.

The local home builders associa-
' tion auxiliary, which donated Gigi
to the zoo in October, sent out invi-
tations last week that “proudly”
announced the wedding.

Quinn said the brief ceremony
will take place at the 200’s giraffe
tower, a wooden structure that al-
lows visitors to walk up two ﬂight
21;“:pr and get face-to-face with

“There will he a best man, maids
of honor, and a wedding reception.
We’ll go through the whole deal,”
said Quinn. “It’s a marriage almost
made in heaven, as high as they
are.”

Quinn said there will be no prob-
lem keeping the giraffes at the tow-
er today because they will be busy
- munching on wreaths made of ed-
ible flowers, fruits and vegetables.

A lay person will perform the
ceremony because Quinn could not
get a minister.

Gus, born 1n Columbia, S. C. 15114
_, months old and has been living at
The Zoo since August. Eight-
month-old Gigi, born in Metrozoo in
Miami, was purchased for $14,000
"by the home builders association.

Although both giraffes are in the
same enclosure during visiting
‘ ' hours, Quinn said they are kept in
separate stalls at night. After the
-. ceremony, they will share the same
‘ listing quarters, Quinn said.

The old elephant house at the

Baltimore Zoo has new, two-legged

inhabitants on display—Homo sa-
piens in a typical human living room
gthat1s behind bars.
“We hOpe to inspire some meas-
‘;_.-ure of introspection about our role
3:in the chain of life,” said Ken

. -;’,Schutz, the 200’s development di-
.2 rector. “Zoo spe0ple understand that

,we tend to separate ourselves from

‘ "‘ the rest of nature.

.. “We wanted to come up with
. something that is both timely and

' interesting,” Schutz added.

There is a rotating cast of four
adult actors and ~20 children for the

. Homo sapiens exhibit.
t‘ Behind the bars, the Homo sapi-

;ens wrapped Christmas presents, ~-

, read comic books, watched televi-
fsion, played board games—and
:even teased and nagged each other.
, The actors for Friday’s opening
day were Ellen Rhudy as the moth-
? pr, Lauren Manekin, 7, and Joe Col-

ts Display

,will, 13, as the children, and Larry

Walsh as Uncle Larry.

“I’ve always loved the zoo," said
Rhudy, although without expecting
ever to be in it. Rhudy is studying
theater at the University of Mary— '
land Baltimore County.

“Acting is not as easy as some-peo-
ple think,” she said. “You just have to
be comfortable being observed. You
just have to divorce yourself from
what’s happening out there."

The display is temporary, Open i
Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 2 pm.
and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 3 pm.
until Christmas. Santa Claus will be
on hand to greet children.

The display will be open from 11
a.m. until 3 pm. weekdays between =
Christmas and New Year’s, when
Frosty the Snowman will replace
Santa'Claus.

Schutz said he was not sure what
the cost of the display will be but
that it would come to “several thou-
sand dollars, or roughly what it

would cost us to fly in koalas for a

month.”

He prospered and ultimately bought a small
farm in the northern part of Monterey

of the birds for $28,000. ‘ ' ‘-

“Except for some manmade differences,-
game cocks don’t look much different from
your average barnyard reoster. They are, as
a rule, longer and leaner. But like their more

highly popular in England until Parliament
outlawed it in 1835. Massachusetts, with its ‘
Puritan heritage, was the first state in the
union to forbid it, in 1836.

Cockfighting arrived in California with
the Spanish. Richard Henry Dana, the er-
rant New Englander, made note of it in his

“Two Years Before the Mast”: “Two fellows .-

cocks are trimmed of their combs and wat-'

ties (the fleshy red pouches that hang be-
neath their beaks) at about 10 months of age.
The operation is more than a mere rite of
passage: The baggy appendages would make

. easy and sensitive targets for opponents to
grab during matches.

7 In Javier’s back yard, which is littered

with junk cars and trailers and the toys of
his children, half a dozen cocks are caged
separately. If they were allowed to roam
free, the place would be in a state of perpet-
ual battle. One of Javier’s teenage sons helps
care for the flock. He feeds them the usual
chicken scratch, along with high-protein
helpings of eggs, milk and chopped beef-
steak. Each morning he exercises his char-
ges, taking special care to strengthen their
legs, which are to fighting cocks as biceps
are to prizefighters.

Sometimes father and son stage spar-
, ring matches. They may hold their birds by
strings and let them have at one another

No one is sure of the exact scale of
cockfighting in California. Each year there
are 500 arrests, according to officials at the
Humane Society of the UnitegStates. These
same officials "guess, ﬁrebaﬁiyjconservative-
1y, that there are 1,000 breeders in the state
and 20,000 across the nation. '

entitled to admission fees, 3 percentage of
the bets and any money he can raise from
beer and food concessions. This can be sub-
stantial enough to require protection. In a

ful.

Cockfighting was carried on quite legal-
ly in California until 1872, when a spirit of

‘ reform had gripped the state. While temper-
; ance groups did battle with the rum demon,
'1 newspapers like the San Francisco Daily Ex-

aminer began crusading against abuses of
animals, including the curious business of
plucking feathers from indignant geese for
the manufacture of “live goose-feather pil-
lows.” The state legislature made it a misde-
meanor for any person‘to “cause any bull,

; bear, cock or dog or other animal to fight for

;' his amusement or personal gain, worry or
injure each other.” ’

Perhaps it was an omen of reform’s
ultimate impotence that two years later, in
1874, the appropriately named chief of po.
lice of San Francisco, Theodore G. Cockrill,
complained that the “brutal and demoraliz-

‘ ing exhibitions” were continuing apace. The

cockfighting law had revealed its first loop
hole. Nonpaying spectators could not be
prosecuted until it was amended several
years later.

hough many more amendments have i
followed, the sport remains as popular 5
as ever. It is especially prevalent in the

Fm Joaquin valley and inMonterey and San

".Diego counties. It flourishes in backwater

{towns like Hollister and Castroville and in

f bigger places like Sacramento and Fresno.
An informal match may be staged by two
friends in a backyard, or 300 to 400 specta-
tors may jam into makeshift bleachers to
witness 2O bouts. At some of these affairs,
there are several fighting pits. Two flagging
birds will be switched to a “drag, pit,” to
finish their match so the crowd can concen-
trate on a fresher, livelier pair.

In 1983, sheriff's deputies closed in on a
. barn in Monterey County. They arrested 61
people, most of whom were from San Jose or
. Los Angeles, and confiscated 50 live roost-
, ers, five deadones and $2,500 worth of fight-
"ing implements. In Watsonville last Decem-
‘ ber30 cookers vanished one Sunday after-
noon when a contingent of deputies from
the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Department
”showed up. Four men were arrested, includ-
ing one spry 82-year-old who was appre-
hended only after leading officers on a
chase across a creek and up a hill.

Roosters equipped with these may fight as
long as 45 minutes, while birds wearing
slashers may dispatch an opponent in sec.
onds, and almost always in less than 10 min-
utes. There is some debate among cockers as
to which is the more sporting method. In
any event, both are quite lethal. A match is

‘ decided when one bird drops dead. Some-
times both will die of their wounds.

opponent’s vulnerable head. The angle of
the slasher is very important. Properly
placed, it can in rare cases decapitate the
enemy bird. '

The ideal fighter is not necessarily the
biggest. Lighter ones tend to fly better. Ja-
vier himself had great plans. Like most cock~
ers, he dabbles in genetics. There are hun-

dreds of breeds of game fowl; Javier
planned to make his own contribution to the
sport by crossing a cock pheasant with a
4game hen of good fighting lineage. The of f-

avier took some of his fighting cocks to
Mexico a few years ago in the back of
his truck. American birds are popular
there because they are well fed and vigor-
ous. The trip went smoothly until Javier was
flagged down by a stern-faced Mexican bor-
der official. The driver wondered if he
would be turned over to American guards.
- But the official only inquired if he could buy
a bird. “No, I’m going to make stew out of
them,” Javier sagely replied.

. In the United States, animal-welfare of?
ficials can cite busts in many counties, but
the victories may be Pyrrhic. In Monterey
County, the Society for Prevention of Cruel-
ty to Animals makes many raids, but often
gets bogged down in paperwork.

“I think we’ve been making a small
dent, but it’s hard to tell,” said the SCPA’s
enforcement officer, Dan Qualls.

There is probably a fight every week
somewhere in the county, and hundreds in
dry creekbeds, barns and back yards across
the state. Still, the cockers are not careless.
“It’s where they’re not, not where they are,"

' one says of selectingria location fora bout.

. Eric Sakach, an investigator for the ﬂu-

{mane Society, first went undercover in the

j late ’705. He made contact with some cockers
at a poultry breeders’ shOw at the Cow Pal-
ace. After some friendly conversation, he
was invited to an event that took place later
that night near Sacramento. Over the next
three months, he gradually built a network

’ of sporting acquaintances. The result was a
bust in El Dorado County in which 50 people, -~
mostly affluent white ranchers, were arrest-
ed. One was a state superintendent of trap— "

a, ,. Morality aside, most cockers and law
5" enforcement agents agree that the sport is
fl gaining in popularity. That gain appears to

be attributable, at least in part, to econom-
ics. ~

“A young man somewhere with a wife
and child could never afford to buy a stable
of horses or anything,” said Mike Strecker, a
past president of the United Game Fowl
Breeders Association. “But he could go out
and buy a half a dozen roosters, and'he could
compete on the same level as a millionaire or
a wetback."

Strecker, who lives in Arroyo Grande,
claims he is not a cockfighter but simply a
fan of the fighting breed He worries about
the people he calls “the bleeding hearts.”
These animal rights’ groups, he says, tried in
the ’705 to make it a felony not only to fight ‘
the birds, but to possess them.

“At that time, my daughter, age 13, was
trying to raise one,” he recalls. “They want-
ed to make her a felon." '

A fighting cock, he points out, lives lon~
ger and better than a typical broiler, which
' is killedat 'Z_or 8 weeks of age. He argues too
that the offense should be reduced from a
misdemeanor to an infraction. This, he says,
would encourage owners of fighting cocks
to cooperate with vaccinating teams, and
would help pre 'ent outbreaks of disease.

Law-enforcement agencies have found
it politically expedient to do nothing at all,
leaving cockfighting a misdemeanor.

Group therapy going to the dogs

By Michael Winerip

New York Times News Service

TETERBORO, NJ. _—- “This kind
of neurotic behavior is not usually
handled in groups,” Dr. Perry
Frantzman explained. His 14 pa-
tients were in a circle. The doctor
had agreed to take them on because
he knew otherwise it might mean
death.

The doctor -— a kind but forceful
man — went around discussing
each one’s problem. “He’s behaving
like an alpha type, but he really is
not,” said Frantzman. “He’d prefer
to be a follower. Because of the fam-
ily attitude, he is the boss, but he
doesn’t want to be boss. As I project
that I’m unsure about him, he’s un-
sure about me. That’s his neurosis.”

Heidi’s trouble was different.
Every time she’s supposed to go out,
she hides under the bed.

“This next one lives in a condo
in Fort Lee,” Frantzman said. “He
was eating everything. I don’t know
-— maybe he doesn’t belong in Fort
Lee.” Perhaps a more rural lifestyle.

And Penny? “A lunatic,” said the
doctor. “A complete lunatic.”

Frantzman heard a noise behind
him. “Who growled?” he asked. “I
don’t want to hear any growling!”
Everyone looked sorry. Heidi hung
her head. Daisy twitched.

“When they’re being evaluated,
they know not to act too aggres-

mask —- they whimper in the cor-
ner, they try to look timid.”

But when they show up for the

hears the voices: “Sit. Sit. SIT! I
MEANIT, SIT! Sit?”

The doctor -.— who has a Ph. D. in
animal behavior -- does group
therapy to try to keep the dogs
alive. Many of the owners are ready
to turn in their alleged best friends.
Each year, 6,000 of the 10,000 dogs
brought to the shelter are killed.

“I was thinking of giving up,”
said Doris Walker, owner of J .J ., an
aggressive shepherd. “I said either
he improves in group or I'll leave
him.” .. ‘

“I was on the verge,” Barbara
Matte said of her fox terrier, Daisy.
“Oh, she’s just crazy. You know that
closeness of genius and insanity?”
Under the doctor’s care, Daisy has
been improving and, Matte said,
“It’s in her favor so far.” Daisy
twitched.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - Novehiber 20, 1987

20 Pet Cats Pose A Hairy Choice

iueri

For 60-Year-01d Wood R

By Safir Ahmed
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

“Boy, I know I’m in big trouble
now,” Howard Austin said as he cra-
dled two of his cats in his back yard.
_“I don’t know what to do. Maybe I’ll
get some place in the country. I just
know I’m in trouble.” «-

Austin’s problem is his cats.

The Wood River City Council has
given tentative approval to an ordi-
nance that would limit each house-
hold to three cats. Austin has 20; he’s
had some for more than a dozen
years.

Austin, 60, says he has two options:
selling the Shady Lane Mobile Home
Park, which he has owned and lived
at for 30 years, or getting rid of the
cats.

Austin has had cats for as long as
he can remember. All the cats he
now has were abandoned, he said. He
has nursed them to health, ensured
that they received the necessary
shots and even built a heated shed for
them in his back vard.

The cats range in age from a 6-
week-old named Pupu to a courtly
and sedate 18-year-old named Casey.
Austin has cats of every color and
size, and they all look well-fed.

Alderman Leroy Emerick said he
proposed the ordinance after neigh-
bors of Austin complained about the
cats coming on their property, sitting
on‘or under their cars and generally
“creating a nuisance.” .

“I like cats myself, although I don’t
have any,” Emerick said. “We just
feel we need to control the number of
cats. They’re not dangerous, but they
kill birds, quail and rabbits. Although
they also kill mice."

In addition to the 3-cats-per-house-
hold limit, the ordinance requires a
$2 license fee per cat. It also says that
the city manager and police chief
should make a determination wheth-.
er any cats are a nuisance or a dan-
ger to the public. If so, the cats are to
be picked up and sent to the Madison
County Animal Control Shelter near
Edwardsville.

Carl H. Rogers, a veterinarian and
administrator for the shelter, said
any cats brought in are kept for three
days. If unclaimed, they are de-
stroyed. .

At the first reading, the ordinance
was approved 3~2, with Mayor Lon
Smith and Alderman Anna Culp vot-
ing against it. The council will vote on
Dec. 7 on final passage. '

said he admired Austin for caring for

ats that were abandoned.
C “He’s a humanitarian. ‘God bless
his soul,” Smith said. He added that
he would vote against the ordinance
the next time around. .

Culp said she had voted against the

ordinance because she liked cats and

because she did not think the ordi-

nance could be enforced.

“It’s ridiculous, it’s no more than a
nuisance ordinance,” Culp said. “Pa-
trolmen aren’t, going to spend time
chasing cats. How in the world are
you going to catch a cat anyway?” _

Hunters
need only
tell   truth

One friend is back from Maine with four

deer for the two weeks he and his friends spent
Zin the western regions. He has plenty of veni-
son stored away. but he hurt his back dragging
a good-sized buck out of the woods. and one of
his neighbors told him. “Serves you right.”

On the matter of hunting. she is not hyster-
ical. as many non-rural folks are these days.
Her comment was mostly in jest. Mostly. It does

"occur to her now and then that there is a kind
of code to hunting that she does not under-
stand. and that puts her a few leagues ahead of
the letter writers to this and other newspapers
who get into a sputtering rage over the sport of
hunﬁng.

Here and there when hunting and suburbia
meet. protests break out among animal right-
ists. as was the case in Newburyport Sunday.
Some undoubtedly kind but misinformed folks
protested the four half-day hunts planned for
the Parker River Wildlife Refuge but. according
to Refuge director Jack Fillio. there have been
no further protests.

l have seen these protests. Once. the daV
after Thanksgiving, 3 waterfowl hunt was pro—
tested on a cold marsh by a small but vocal
band undoubtedly fortified by their turkey

.feast of the day before.

> There are at least two instinCtsthat operate
{fat the core of anti-hunting sentiment. One is

I'fthe mission to spare animals from pain. The
garother is hatred for a person who derives plea-
:;_sure from the hunt. They are quite different
gifrom one another. and equally as shallow.

In the Parker River situation. the fact is
that 130 deer in the refuge is too large a herd
for the habitat. As the habitat is exhausted 0f
browse. not only do those 130 deer suffer. so do
several other species. as well as plant life. Se-
vere habitat degradation takes many seasons
to reverse itself. so the natural conflict grows
more severe every year.

According to Fillio. deer examined from
Parker River are already showing much lower
than normal fat content. which means the ani—
mals are not getting enough nourishment now
to survive an extreme winter. There are simply
no natural predators to balance the burgeoning
growth of the herd.

 

Those are the facts of the case. whether or
not the antis choose to accept them. Another

unpopular fact is that live-trapping and mov-

ing white-tail deer is almost totally unsuccess-

‘ful every time it is tried. But the antis generally

would rather have deer starve than shot by
hunters.

As for the out-and-out hunter haters. one
supposes this is one of the many reversions to

"childhood instinct most of us have. In this one.

the ”victim“ identifies with the hunted. the na—
ture’s innocents being stocked by the maniacal

ghunter from his corrupt world of men. You can
geven work a little Garden of Eden into the
theme without much effort. and certainly all

those children's stories. from ”Bambi" t0 “Pe-
ter and the Wolf." echo in all their mythic pro-

, portions.

Indeed. Newburyport protesters carried

‘signs Sunday that read: “Don’t kill Santa‘s
.reindeer!” '

The hunter’s biggest mistake. PR—wise. is to

.pretend he is a conservationist. The Parker
. .River herd needs reduction. to be sure. but for
{Joe Remington t0 play-act that his weapon is a
tool with which he is going off to do his duty for
.nature is a farce that deserves all the derision it

gets.

Around non—rural areas. hunters are going

..to have a problem. PR-wise. until they are able
i... to state the simple truth that there is pleasure
.‘in hunting and killing animals. Only within
‘ that context - let’s call it honesty — can he then

explain the stark. unambiguous code of moral-

. ity under which the great majority of hunters
' conduct themselves in the woods or field. Only

within that context does all the rest of the plea-

T‘sure of the hunt make sense — the natural

beauty. the exercise. the camaraderie. Only in
.that context can the hunter admit that his
sport is also a game in which he pretends that
the only important elements in the world are

' fire. shelter and the ability to be successful in
g ‘the pursuit of meat.

Further upcountry. or off in most rural

”places. no such explanation is needed. Some

“day during Maine’s moose-hunting season.
‘drop into that Sportsman’s mecca of Greenville
and watch the hunters bringing moose out of
the woods. A huge crowd (for there) gathers
downtown in an air of celebration as the ani-
~mals are brought in to be weighed.

It would never occur to a young kid in
Greenville to even remotely associate Santa‘s
reindeer with a carcass on a jackpole. The
nearer one lives to the natural world. the more
distinct the difference between myth and reali—
ty.
The further one gets from the natural world.

the easier it becomes to cloud the fact that most
anti-hunting sentiment is but a misdirected
form of self-pity.

My friend whose party brought home four
deer described to his neighbor how he had

stopped for hours to watch the stunning spec-
tacle 0f ravens in the fog. He was fascinated
also by the sight of'an eagle and a large rare
' woodpecker.

“Why didn't you just take a camera with

you and take pictures 0f the things you find

beautiful?" she asked. .
”Because I love hunting deer. too. I like them
both."
The simple truth. He needed say no more to
justify himself.

 




ATLANTA JOURNAL/CONSTITUTION - November 22, 1987

U.S. secretly F

using dolphins
for war work _

E] ANIMAL RESEARCH BY MILITARY 15A

By Rand Carthon
SW Writer

For the past 25 years, the Navy and the CIA
have been training various sea mammals, such as,
the bottlenose dolphin, for sophisticated and po-
tentially dangerous underwater work. -

The dolphins provide a relatively cheap and;
reliable method for the Navy to strike at enemy
shipping, infiltrate harbors, locate and retrieve
hardware from deep below the surface of the sea,
and provide protection against hostile divers for
its own shipping, according to military and civil-
ian sources familiar with the program.

Very little is known about the pro am, with
the military particularly close—mouth
use of dolphins as possible weapons.

Some public knowledge of the program grew
outwof the__Navy’s releasing dolphins in Cam Ranh

 

 

Bay, Vietnam, in 1971 in an experi-

mental program designed to protect

American ships. The Navy never

has given details of the program or
' commented on its effectiveness.

A former Navy officer familiar
with the Vietnam experiment, who
requested anonymity, said the dol-
phins were equipped with a snout-
mounted syringe that allowed them
to attack and kill enemy divers by
pumping pressurized gas into them.

. Last month, the public received
another glimpse of the program
when the Navy deployed five bott-
lenose dolphins and a support crew
of 20, including one veterinarian, in ,
the Persian Gulf.

* A Pentagon spokesman said at
the time the Navy was using the
dolphins to provide “an underwater
surveillance and detection capabili-
ty.” Details were classified, but the
mission included locating mines, the
spokesman said. The Navy claims
none of the dolphins is in danger.

Since October, one dolphin,
Skippy, has died of bronchial pneu-
monia, according to Lt. Ken Ross, a
Navy spokesman.

About half the 240 mammals
trained in the program since 1962
are bottlenose dolphins, the animals
made famous by the television se-
ries “Flipper.” These animals, long
a staple of aquariums and aquatic.
shows, are highly intelligent, adapt :
readily to human contact and can ‘

. The Marine Mammal Training
iProgram is based at the Navy’s
’Oceans Systems Center in San Die-
:gnOther training facilities are at

eohe Bay in Hawaii, and Key
West, Fla.

Research and military use
. The Navy’s training program is

, two-pronged. One part is research

into various aspects of marine
mammals, such as their ability to
dive deeply and resurface without
decompression, and the complexity
of their languages. The research has
produced dozens of articles and pa-
pers by civilian scientists in the
program. Navy spokesmen discuss
the research aspects willingly.

. The second part, where dolphins
and other sea mammals are trained

to perform as weapons carriers, is x

the one that draws a blank from
military spokesmen. “No media
will be able to inteview anyone con-
nected with the program or visit
any of the training facilities,” Ross
said.

The Navy’s use of sea mammals
for military purposeshas drawn
criticism from animal rights groups,
such as Greenpeace. “The use of
dolphins and other sea mammals
for military purposes is a complete
misuse of their amazing physical
capabilities,” said Neville Williams,
a Greenpeace spokesman. “Animals
are non-political, and to inject them
into a dangerous political situation
is unconscionable.”

The Navy is not the only service
branch to use animals for both re-
search and operational purposes.
Various animals are used by the
military for a myriad of research
projects, ranging from beagles for
visual research to bears that tested
ejection seats in airplanes during
the earliest days of the equipment’s
development.

Only the Navy’s animals have
been trained as weapons. ‘

Since the Marine Mammal Pro-
tection Act in 1972 laid down strin-

gent guidelines on the capture and

handling of marine mammals, the
Navy has exposed only the harest
outline of its program. For exam-
ple, the Defense Department’s fiscal
1987 budget allowed the Navy to
capture “not more than 25 marine

' mammals each year for national de-

fense purposes.” The program was
funded with $5.5 million. A marine
biologist who has trapped dolphins
for the Navy over the years said,

“Nothing like 25 dolphins are cap- ‘

hired for the Navy each year.”

Many of the Navy’s dolphins-

come from the Gulf of Mexico and
are captured in the warm, shallow

waters .along the coast of Alabama,

, MlSSlSSlppi and Louisiana.
. Moby Sonlagi, a marine biologist
. With Marine Animal Products in ’
Gulfport, Miss, said his company

has done “capture work” for the
2‘ Navy.

3 -. Soulagi would not say how many
:animals he has captured for the
military or what each animal cost.
”Estimates from other marine biolo—
gists familiar with dolphin capture
techniques and the cost of acclimat-
‘ing the animals place the expense
at $30,000 to $50,000 per animal.

To many, dolphins are the per-
fect aquatic animal — highly intelli—
gent, adjusting easily to life with
humans. They also are an animal
with a long connection to human
history, having been mentioned in

. the writings of Aristotle, Aesop, He-

rodotus, and the Plinys. One of the
most famous sculptures of ancient
Greece is of a boy astride the back
of a leaping dolphin.

There is another connection be-
tween dolphin and man less easily
explained.

“It is common among pe0ple
who work with dolphins to have
them explain the experience in al-
most mystical terms,” said Dan

‘_ Odell, a research biologist with the

‘ Sea World Research Institute. “For

3 most peeple there is about the dol-

? bin 3 sense of a deeply rooted

I elligence.”

'. ' A dolphin’s brain is larger —
both in size and in its brain-to—body
weight ratio -— than a human’s. Its
hearing also is acute, and it assimi~
lates up to 20 times more informa-
tion with its ears than a human.

, So intelligent are dolphins that
they not only can find the solution
to a problem but can communicate
that solution to another dolphin out
of sight but within hearing range.
The two dolphins then can work in

. concert to solve the problem.

Research also has shown that

‘ dolphins’ echo location, a kind of so—
nar, is so sensitive that they can
differentiate between different types
of metal in darkness.

Despite the Navy’s insistence};
that the range of the dolphin’s mis-
sion in the Persian Gulf is limited,
civilian and military sources con-1
tend dolphins’ intelligence and train-g,

Attaching mines to ships

Defense Week magazine has re-
ported that the Navy was training
dolphins, which can swim 40 mph,
to find enemy submarines, pursue
them and attach magnetic mines to
their hulls.

“These animals have been
trained to do everything from at-
taching mines to ships to neutraliz-
ing enemy divers who might be try-
ing to do the same to our ships,” a
Navy veteran familiar with the pro-
gram said.

Other marine mammals, with
' different capabilities than dolphins,
also are being trained in the
program.

their deep-diving capabilities, have 1

The secret mission included locating mines.

¥been trained in a program called
i“Quick Find” to retrieve objects

such as dummy torpedoes from as
deep as 750 feet below the ocean
surface.

The sea lions follow a sound
emitted by dummy torpedoes or
missiles. Once the dummies are lo-
cated, a harness worn by the animal
is attached to the object and it is
hauled to the surface.

One member of a Washington-
based defense think tank who has
knowledge of the Navy program
sees in Quick Find the groundwork
for a program that could locate and
retrieve other objects from the
ocean.

“Say the Soviets had a sub a
thousand feet down and it broke
up,” he said. “There would be a tre-
mendous amount of technology and
military secrets lying down there.
The race would be to see who could
get to it the fastest.”

For whatever reasons, the .

Navy’s deep- diving programs are

pushing to greater and greater i
depths. The Navy is experunenting -‘

 

with 10 Beluga whales Ross said.

1' Belugas, characterized by their
white color, are capable of diving

more than 2,100 feet.

According to one congressional
staffer, the tales of “killer dolphins”
and deep—diving sea lions retrieving
Soviet hardware from the ocean
floor are just the public tip of the
Navy program. “The Navy is as
tight-tipped about this as about any-
thing I know 0 ,” the staffer said.

1 “It’s one of those programs where

the. Navy asks for funding, and
when the congressman asks what
it’s for he is greeted with a blank
stare.”

The program began in 1962 at

g the Naval Weapons Center at China
‘ Lake, an inland California naval

base, but soon was moved to the
Pacific Missile Range at Point
Magu, Calif.

‘ “During those years, there was
a great deal of concern about a div-
er swimming up to a nuclear sub
that was in port beside its, tender
and blowing it up,” said a "former _
Navy officer involved in e pro-
ject’s genesis “The original idea

Bottlenose dolphins ,. -- -‘

About 90 of these mammals, made famous in the ‘Flipper’ televi-
sion series, are in the program. The bottlenose is noted for its
intelligence, ready adaptability to man, and communication skills.
Research on the animals has shown they have an ability to com-
municate with one another verbally and that they speak in two
‘languages’ one a series of clicks and squeals audible to the hu-
man ear and one pitched beyond human hearing. Dolphins are

also able to process 20 times more information through hearing
than humans.

 

Beluga whales

The whales, which are white and measure up to 15 feet in length,
are commonly found in arctic waters but easily adapt to life in
warmer waters. The Navy has added 10 whales to its training
program. Marine biologists speculate that the Navy is interested

These animals, about 15 of
which are in the Navy’s pro-

cause of a diving capability
that allows them to descend

' around the subs and protect them.
At first, they had big knives on
their heads.”

Over the years, the knives
evolved into a more sophisticated
weapons system. Michael Green-
wood, a civilian researcher who
worked with the Navy until 1972,
said five years later that he quit af-
ter findin evidence of the Navy us-
ing dolp ins as weapons and of
learning that Navy-trained dolphins
were being sold to Latin American
countries.

Greenwood’s allegations came
during the trial of two animal-rights
activists accused in 1977 of releas-
ing dolﬁhins from Navy holding
pens in awaii.

Greenwood also claimed the CIA
was using its Key West base to
train weapons-carrying dolphins to
attack Soviet military ships in Ha-
vana harbor in Cuba.

The CIA and the Navy refuse to
answer questions about Greenwood’s
claims.

The lengths to which the govern-
ment will go to protect the pro-
gram’s secrecy was demonstrated in
1983 when a libel suit against Pent-
house ,pmagazinew by ,_ a former Navy

“contractor with knowledge Of the

Marine Mammal Training Program

'was stOpped by the Justice
ent.

A The magazine accused James
Fitzgerald of selling information to
foreign countries about the mili-
tary’s use of dolphins. The Justice
Department, in persuading a judge
to drop the suit, said Fitzgerald had
“full knowledge of the military uses
of dolphins” and any testimony
would violate national security.

While some marine biologists
who have worked in the program
claim its focus has shifted signifi-
cantly over the years to research
from the training of the animals to
deliver weapons, there is no doubt
the animals’ capabilities as weapons
are being fully explored. ‘

“The dolphins are highly intelli-
gent, can be trained to do almost
anything a man can do and are
highly accurate,” a former Navy Of-
ficer said. “With the proper training.
they could be like a fleet of 6-foot
submarines.”

Military has long history of using animals

 

By Road Cawthon
Stat! Writer

 

I From camels to chimpanzees, from geese to bears,

the military has a long history of employing animals '

for research and Operational purposes. They include:

I Horses. Although the Army retains horses for
ceremonial purposes, the Navy still maintains a horse-
mounted patrol at Clark Air Base in the Philippines.
The patrol, one of the last of its kind in the military, is
:sed ton a portion of the base that is covered in dense
ores .

I Dogs. All branches of the military make exten-
sive use of dogs, from German shepherds to Doberman
pinschers. They are deployed for security reasons and
to sniff out drugs and explosives. Smaller breeds of
dogs, such as terriers, also are used to sniff out drugs
in places the larger'dogs cannot reach.

Dogs also have been used in military research. Ear-
ly efforts by the Air Force to develop bombs that “see”
involved testing the sight Of beagles. The dogs’ eyes-
were wired in an effort to determine how vision works.
After the Operation, the eyes were returned to normal.

I Geese. The Army uses geese as sentries at instal-
lations in West Germany. Geese also were used to
guard bridges in Vietnam. The noises made by the
geese when disturbed are like “live versions qt dangling
tin cans on a wire,” an Army spokesman said. -

I Falcons. In the early 1980s, an Air Force base in
Spain was plagued by swarms of birds whose ﬂight hin-
dered aircraft Operation. To end the “bird strikes,” Air

Force personnel began morning flights Of falcons
around the airfield, thus driving other birds from theE

area

I Bears. When the Air Force began testing ejection
seats, chimpanzees were deemed too light to test how‘

Uh! Atlanta Journal AND CONSTITUTION .

the seat would work with a human occupant. The an-
swer was black bears. “The weight was right, and the
construction of the bears’ spines was similar to a hu-
man’s,” a Pentagon spokesman said. “None of the bears
was hurt.”

I'Rabbits. They have been used extensively by the
Army in chemical and biological warfare experiments.

I Primates. These animals with their human-like
anatomy have been used in extensive research by the
military. Perhaps the most famous military primates
were the spider monkeys and chimpanzees launched by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in
early tests of the manned spaceflight program.

I Mules. Since its earliest days, the Army has de-

pended on pack mules to move supplies in largely inac- ,

cessible areas. The last time mules were used exten-
sively in the Army was in World War II. At the end Of
the war, the United States rounded up 20,000 mules
from seven Southern and Western states and shipped
them to Iran to replace animals taken by the German
army. -

I Camels. Before the railroad crossed the country,
camels were brought to New Mexico and Arizona by
the Army. After the railroad arrived, the Camel Corps
was disbanded and the camels were released into the
wild. The military has no Camel Corps now, but wild
camels allegedly still roam the more desolate areas of
the Southwest.

I Chickens. The Air Force has a device known as
“The Chicken Cannon.” Recently killed chickens are
fired, feathers and all, from a converted cannon with a
20-foot barrel at the windshields and into the engines of
test aircraft at 700 mph. The chicken carcasses are .
fired to see how the aircraft will withstand the impact
of a bird in flight.

Cup races from January through April—the period

during which the Cup trials, if held, would occur off
San Diego in 1991.

Unusual Opportunties for Study

Scientists say little is known about the long-term
impact of boating on the migration of gray whales, an
estimated 15,000 to 20,000 of which travel south from
Alaskan waters each year to their'breeding lagoons off
Baja California; '
~ ' Some say the species appears adaptable and resil-
ient, based on its recent comeback from , near-ex-
tinction. But they say the new pressures in San Diego
County have created unusual opportunities 'to learn
more about the whales’ remarkable, 15,000-mile round
tri .

Plt’s a magnificent phenomenon that’s been going on
for thousands of years,” said Seth Schulberg, presxdent
of the environmental cunsulting firm doing the N avy’s
study. “It would be sort of disappointing if in 20 years
we could manage to totally disrupt it.” _ _ '

“It’s possible for the [activities] to exrst side by Side
withoUt ’detriment to the whales,” said Stephen
Leatherwood of Sea World Research Institute, which
is at Hubbs Marine Research Center, the. researcharm
of the well-known marine park. “ . . .But we would
do well to make this a test case of how sensitive we are
in Southern California about our ‘pet whales.’ ”

Landing Craft’s Impact on Whales

The Navy’s interest in the whales stems from its:

decision to base at Camp Pendleton as many as .45
landing craft air cushions, or LCACs—each 87 feet long
and 47 feet wide, capable of carrying upward of 60‘tons'

Boat Traffic, Whales

and traveling at speeds above 40
knotsor 46 miles per hour.

The hovercraft, which travels
above land and water ona cushion
of air, is‘described by Navy officials
as “the newest concept in amphibi-

+ , ous warfare,” designed for speedily

shuttling Marines and equipment
from 30 miles out at sea onto enemy
shores.

Three are already operating out
of Camp Pendleton, selected as one
of only two such bases in the
United States and the only one in
the West. Navy officials say three

more of the craft are to arrive

shortly; the full complement is
expected by the mid- 19908.

But in applying in the early 19803
for permits to Operate the craft, the
Navy encountered the federal En-
dangered [Species Act, under which
any federal agency contemplating
activities that might harm an en—
dangered species must consult with
federal wildlife agencies.

“Our major concern is adding
more and more noise to the envi-
ronment and greater and greater
disturbance to the gray whales as
they migrate down the California
coastline,” Jim Lecky, a wildlife
biologist with the National Marine
Fisheries Service, said last week.

“We know that most animal
populations withstand disturbance
up to a point and then they start to
abandon their habitat,” he said.
. .So we’re concerned about
where that threshold of distur-
bance might be that would cause
them to abandon their migratory
route.”

So Lecky’s agency made it a
condition of the N avy’s permit that
the Navy study the effects of the
hovercraft on the whales. If it is
found that the whales are altering
their route, the service might re-
quire that the Navy limit its activi—
ties to non-migratory seasons,
Lecky said.

The study began informally two
years ago. Members of Schulberg’s

Cardiff -based firm, Southwest Re-

search Associates, sallied forth out

of Oceanside in an inflatable boat
and on whale-watching vessels for
tourists to begin delineating the
migratory routes without the pres-
ence of hovercraft.

Last year, the study picked up.
Between January and April, the
consultants ﬂew 50 hours of aerial ‘
surveys in Marine Corps helicop-

. ters out of Camp Pendleton, mak-

ing detailed observations of the
whales’ movements and behavior.
Group size, respiration rate and
direction of swimming were noted,
as well as the presence of pairs of
whale cows and their calves. The
surveyors moved methodically
back and forth along straight lines

between the coast and Santa Cata-

lina and San Clemente islands.

According to Schulberg, one of
the most striking findings of the
first two years was how far off-
shore the southbound whales were
traveling, mostly sweeping west of
the islands before cutting east to
hug the coastline south of the
border.

“A lot of people have speculated
that the reason you’re. seeing more
whales offshore is a direct influ-
ence of traffic,” Schulberg said
“That’s a topic to be studied. I don’t V.
think anyone knows the answer”-

Study to Be Broadened

This year, the study is to be ,
expanded to include what Schul-
berg called “LCAC-gray whale
interactions.” The consultants in-
tend to spend 130 hours in the air,
much of it during the peak migra-
tion and when the craft will be
engaged in daily exercises.

Next year, the final year of the
study, the consultants and the
Navy intend to encourage closer
contact between the hovercraft
and the whales, directing the hov-
ercraft operators from the air to
areas where whales are traveling.

“We will determine what is the
zone of influence an LCAC has to a
whale,” said Steven Kovach, a fish
and wildlife specialist with the
Navy. “How close does the ma—

reaet to its presence? The whales
may flat ignore these things, we
don' t know."

However, Schulberg noted that
the surveyors will studiously avoid
arranging encounters betheen the
hovercraft and so-called “cow-calf
pairs.” Such pairs are “too sensitive
a population segment to risk exper .
imentation,” Schulb'er'g said.

Finally, the study will prodtme a
report for the Navy detailing

~ behavior to human activities rather
than subtleenvironmental chang-
es.
He noted that the use of acoustic
waves by oil and geological survey
teams initially prompted fears that
migration routes would be disrupt-
ed. Other concerns have involved
the impact of pollution and fishing
gear, such as gill nets that kill
about 20 whales a year.

Leatherwood cited several stud-
ies of whales’ responses to interfer-
ence.

In the early 19805, scientists at
Hubbs studying whales’ responses
to natural oil seepage off Santa
Barbara found that the whales
made longer dives, spent less time

on the surface and sWam faster. But ,

Leatherwood said there was no
evidence that the experience was
“detrimental.” .

A comparable study off Monte-
rey measured whales’ responses to
sounds projected at them through
the water. Though the whales
avoided intense sounds within
hearing range, Leatherwood said
the study was unable to prove a
long-term effect

Finally, Leatherwood mentioned ‘

the observed response of gray
whales to the siting of a scallop
fishery in San Ignacio Lagoon in
Baja California: Whales used the
lagoon extensively before the fish-
ery opened, Seemed to avoid it
when the fishery came, and re-
turned after it closed.

“Circumstantial evidence or hard
science?” Leatherwood asked. “I
don’t know.”

. “I think there are thresholds of
interference beyond which animals
simply will not tolerate that envi-
ronment any further,” he added.

BOB GRIESER / Los Angeles Times

ther I nor anyone can say.

“My working hypothesis would
be that if you were willing to study
it for long enough, you could find a
threshold of noise, pollution and
other interference that would ei-
ther run gray whales out of an
immediate area or would stress
them so much that it incapacitated
them."

That kind of stress could inter-
fere with a female whale’s ovula-
tion or cause the whale to abort a
fetus, Leatherwood said. Or, in the
case of noise interference, it could
interrupt the whales’ ability to
communicate.

But Leatherwood said he be-
lieves that gray whales appear to
be “highly adaptable” and that it
would take a significant interfer-
ence to affect their survival. He
said he is more concerned about
fishing nets, “because animals are
dying in gill nets along the Califor-
nia coast each year.” .

.Roger Payne, senior scientist at
the World Wildlife Fund in Wash-

ington, DC, and president of a.

Massachusetts-based institute that
does long-term studies on long-
lived animals, said he too believes
experience indicates that gray
whales may be relatively resilient.

“The brutal fact is that during a
period of unprecedented growth
and increase in ship traffic, the
populations of whales have recov-
ered to what may be their original
numbers,” Payne said in a tele-
phone interview last week.

“That suggests to me that, how-
ever annoying the various annoy-
ances . . . may be, that is not
seriously affecting their reproduc-
tive fitness,” Payne added. . .If
it’s not affecting the number of
young, then it’s hard to argue that
it’s destroying the population.”

Payne then went a step further.

Citing what is called the “friend-
ly whale phenomenon,” he noted
that gray whales on occasion actu-
ally pursue human contact, ap-
proaching tourist boats and even
rolling over to display their bellies,
which some boat captains obliging-
1y scratch with brooms.

“What this suggests is that may- 7
be whales even like people," Payne ‘
speculated. “If they do, and if one
presses legislation to remove that
contact, my feeling is that could be
a mistake. It could prevent or slow
what I think is potentially the most

interesting bond between humans %

and mammals that I have seen.” i

George Key says he is going to kill the
cat. ~
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

The cat is making him look bad. “Sit
down,” he says, and the cat just stands
there, a million miles away, lost in cat re-
vene.

“If you don’t mind,” says George Ney,
poking the cat gently. “Sit down, please.
Bang. Bang. Bang.”

The cat is not into playing dead either.

“Good for him,” says Patty Cantella, a
spectator at this trained-cat demonstration
at a Long Grove cat boutique. “Cats are
independent. That’s one of the reasons
people find them intriguing.” .

laughing. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha; Best part of

trainer up there with his cowboy hat, his _

rhinestone belt and his enthusiastic com—

mands; the cat, languid, looking at him as
if to say, “Spare me the exhortations,
Tex.”

“The audience goes crazy when the cats
don’t cooperate,” Ney says later. “They say
to each other, ‘I told you cats can’t be
trained.’ ”

But cats can be trained. Ney, a Mun-
delein resident who bills himself as the
world’s foremost educator of domestic cats.
can, for example, persuade his perfomiing
cats to obey the verbeJ command “sit"
fully half of the time. True feline aﬁciona—
dos realize that this is an accomplishment
roughly equivalent to teaching a moose to
play the saxophone. >

And when Ney proqs ,or strokes his cats

in the hindquarters as he tells them‘ to sit,
his success rate climbs above 90 percent,
he says. Using chiCken— and liver—ﬂavored
treats, he puts the kitties through an array
of stunts that includes rolling from side to
side, jumping through hoops, hopping over
batons, begging and playing dead.

“We don’t have them fetch,” says Susan

Fadem, Ney’s associate, “because they
probably wouldn’t come back.”

Fadem has helped Ney write an instruc— _

tional paperback, “The Educated Cat”
(Dutton, $8.95), which Ney is autogra-
phing between trick demonstrations at the
(:ztziip Shoppe this afternoon. She says

st people have no expectations
.,-,' cats at all. and that Ney’s work is
“revolutionary.”

Wendy Bruck of Romeoville
thinks “cute” sums it up better. She
happens by the demonstration just
.as Peanut Butter, one of Ney’s litter
' of half a dozen stars, is sitting up
on the cat high chair, paws on the
table, snarfmg a treat.

“But cats are boring. I hate
them,” she says, occasioning a
sharp intake of breath from the
shop proprietor. “They’re good for
nothing. They don’t listen to any-

It was once ﬁnanced by the coun-
ty, but was up for grabs when Atas-
cadero incorporated in 1979. Gen-
eral Curator Alan Metzler says the
city had to decide whether to dis-

‘ band the project, or ﬁnd people who
could run it professionally.

Metzler spent many years as a
keeper at the San Diego Zoo before
coming "to Atascadero. He was very
pleased with the community he
found.

"The Atascadero community has
been very helpful," he said. "The
zoo is the focal point for community
involvement. They are very proud of
it, but we like to share the thought
that it is the whole county’s zoo."

Volunteers help take care of the
animals, run the gift sh0p, and help -
maintain the grounds. Local grocery
stores, Wllliams Bros. and Safeway,
regularly donate food for the ani-
mals. And businesses donate money
earmarked for speciﬁc projects,
helping the Zoo Society make cap-
ital improvements.

The attempt to utilize local talent
has brought 1n Cal Poly students
who design animal habitats free of
charge. The students earn the satis-
faction of seeing their work take
shape in society, while at the same
time fulﬁlling senior project require-
ments. Meanwhile, the zoo is able to

reduce the cost of upgrading its

facilities, Metzler said.

Unfortunately, renovation is still
expensive and at times, Metzler
feels frustrated. "You can’t change
things for all the animals at once.
You do the best you can with what
you’ve got," he said.

Sometimes people think of zoos
as cruel places where animals are
imprisoned, but Metzler says a lot of
people see animal needs 1n terms of
their own needs.

"We can’t reproduce nature, but

you can provide a naturalistic envi-
ronment with proper diet, heat,
space, and companionship, if they
need it."

The American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums ex-
plains the importance of zoos in lit—
erature Metzler made available.
Zoos serve to educate people about
the fragility of nature, to remind
them that we must protect animals
in their natural habitats.

 

"Many original habitats in which
animal species developed and ﬂour-
ished have been modiﬁed by human
activities," the literature states.
"Animals living in comfortable
homes in zoos and aquariums serve
as ambassadors to remind us that we
are destroying animals’ homes in
the wild and must save some wild
places or lose the rich wildlife heri-
tage of the world."

Zoos have served as pioneer
programs for breeding many endan-
gered species. For instance, the

' Asiatic wild horse, Pere David’s

deer and the Hawaiian goose would
be extinct if it weren’t for captive
breeding programs, the zoological
association reports.

Metzler says zoos promote wild-
life for our children’s lifetimes. Un-
less we appreciate wildlife, he says,
it will become extinct. "And once an
animal is extinct it is gone forever.
There is no technology that can
create a new species."

The Charles Paddock Zoo is lo-
cated on Highway 41, one mile west
of Highway 101, in Atascadero.
Hours are 10 am. to 4 pm. daily.
Suggested donations are $1 adults,
50 cents children, and children un-“
der seven years old are admitted
free.

Kids. get hands-on
experience at the zoo

By Karen Morley-Smith

A unique experience awaits those
who venture to the Charles Paddock
Zoo. Located in Atascadero, a sce-
nic 40-minute drive from Cambria,
the zoo offers its visitors a chance to
step back in time.

There are no guided bus tours at
this zoo, no uphill climbs, no escala-
tors, and rarely is there what could
be termed a crowd.,It’s easy to study
an animal, even to develdp a mutual
understanding, because just a few
feet of space separates the people
from the animals. And there’s no
rush to move from one habitat to an-
other.

The only zoo between San Jose
and Santa Barbara, the Charles Pad-
dock Zoo began 30 years ago as a
private collection of orphaned and
injured animals being nursed back
to health.

It is situated on three acres at
Atascadero Lake Park, where park-
goers can picnic, barbecue, feed
geese and ducks, and rent paddle
boats. -

The zoo draws 135,000 vistors
each year. Some of these guests are
school children who travel miles by
bus just to see a zoo.

Children can frolic at the new pet-
ting 200, where goats and their kids,
llamas and other gentle four-legged
friends romp freely. For 25 cents,
children can purchase a handful of
food pellets for the animals to enjoy.

Another star attraction is the
chance for children to experience

- the thrill of putting their head inside

a lion’s mouth. But Mom and Dad
don’t have to worry about the teeth,
because they’re fak ; a large, color-
ful replica of a rather silly looking
lion hosts a public drinking foun-
tain.

At each habitat a plaque provides
information about the animal they
are viewing. Some of the animals on
the must-meet list include Benett the
Lemur; Teco the spider monkey and
his friend Chiquita; Onyx and
Ebony, a pair of jaguars; and two
Bengal Tigers, Serin and Tasha.
There’s also a walk-through bird
aviary and a 23-year-old Sun Bear.

This little zoo has seen many
changes in its day. Once a maze of .
cages where animals sweltered in
summer heat, specially designed
habitats now provide comfortable
living for many of the 125 animas.

The Chinese government no longer of-
fers pandas as state gifts because they
are an endangered species. The loan pro-
gram that brought Ling Ling and Yong
Yong to Busch Gardens was set up in
1981 to satisfy public demands to see the
pandas and raise money for China‘s pan-
da conservation program.

Yong Yong is 5 years old and was res-
cued as an abandoned infant in the wild.
Ling Ling was born in Beijing Zoological
Gardens. He is 2.

Admiring crowds will view the pandas
from a people-mover that glides past the
separate but side-by-side, sky-lighted
habitats. Ling Ling and Yong Yong were
given separate homes because pandas
are shy, solitary animals that prefer to
live alone except at mating time and to
raise their young.

Busch Gardens spent six months build-
ing the pandas‘ temporary quarters, each
cooled to a panda-pleasing 70 degrees

and replete with cascading waterfalls,
rocks and foliage. Bamboo, the preferred
panda cuisine. is plentiful.

“I’ve seen pandas in the Berlin 200 and
in Washington, DC. and this is very
nice,” said tourist Karl Horsten of West
Germany. “I guess you could call me a
panda fan."

Horsten’s wife, Leni, joined hundreds
of others crowding a gift shop that offers
all types of panda souvenirs. from toy

key chains and drinking glasses.

Bali’s Birds

N an effort to replenish the popu-
lation of Jalak Bali birds on
their native island in Indonesia,
10 zoos in the United States
have shipped 40 of the birds to Indo—
nesia.

Only about 60 of the birds, also
known as Bali mynahs, are living in
the wild on the island, the only place
they exist naturally, according to
wildlife experts and Indonesian offi-
cials who discussed the project at a
news conference at the Indonesian
Embassy in Washington last week.

The birds were brought together in
Los Angeles and flown Friday to the
Surabaja Zoo on the Indonesian is—
land of Java. The birds’ offspring will
be released in a national park on Bali
next spring, they said.

  

This protect is the first intended to
release smaller, perching birds into
the wild from zoos, said Robert Sei-
bels, who selected the birds to be
shipped and is curator of birds at the
Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, SC.

The Ball mynah was discovered by
Western biologists in 1911 and soon
became popular in zoos because of its
striking features. It is about eight

‘Seeing’ Inside Rocks

 

A new acoustic scanning device de-
veloped by a Stanford University geo—
physicist is enabling scientists to
“see” the internal structure of rocks.
The instrument is proving effective in
predicting the fluid permeability of
rocks, knowledge that can be useful in
oil exploration, hydrology and the dis-
posal of hazardous wastes.

Amos Nur, chairman of Stanford’s
geophysics department, who devel—
oped the device, said the laboratory
version was yielding more precise in-
formation about rock structure and
porosity than is obtainable with
standard techniques, such as seismic
probes in the field or viewing thin
slices of rock under a microscope.

By detecting how an electrical
pulse changes shape or velocity after
traveling through a rock, the acoustic
scanner permits researchers to un-
derstand the pore space, fluid con—
tent, grain shapes and other proper-
ties of rock. An oscilloscope monitors
the changes in the pulse, and a com-
puter analyzes the data.

Dr. Nur said petroleum engineers
were experimenting with the tech-
nique for predicting the fluid perme—
ability of rocks. Knowing the pore
structure of oil—bearing rock would
enable them to assess the feasibility
of recovering the oil.

”Fields like hydrology and waste
disposal are just beginning to realize
that you have to know a lot about the
structure and physics of rocks to dis
pose of things safely,” Dr. Nur said.

 

 




BOSTON GLOBE - November

Critics question .
Geary’s selection

1‘ {-300 director

By Bruce Mohl
Globe Staff

Metropolitan District Commissioner William
Geary has hired a 35-year-old veterinarian to be the
executive director of the Franklin Park and Stone
ham zoos, prompting grumbling from critics who say
the veterinarian is not qualified to manage the two
ailing facilities. .

“\

Geary's aides say the appointment of Mark Gold—
stein is intended to provide the zoos with some lead-
ership until legislation passes that would establish
an independent zoo corporation with a nearly $10
million budget. The corporation would then be
charged with conducting a national search to find a
chief executive to run the zoos.

. nationally.” said one frequent

critic of Geary with the zoological

society. “The comment will be

‘politics as usual.‘ "

J on wasn't advertised

Daniel Morley, a member of the

 

 

; society's executive committee.
said he did not think Goldstein
had enough experience in zoo

management to run the two zoos.
He also said he was concerned
that Geary did not conduct a
search for an interim executive di—
rector or even advertise the job.

“None of us knew any search
was on." Morley said. “This came
out of the blue."

Burgay said there wasn’t time
to advertise the. ;ob and conduct a
search. He acknowledged that the
MDC already employs a director of
the zoological gardens, but said a
higher—ranking official with a fa-
miliarity with animals was need-
ed d-uring the transition period.

Burgay said Geary talked to

several people about the job and
concluded Goldstein's background
met their needs. in addition to his
staff job at Angel] Memorial, Gold-
stein has been a consulting veter-

- inarian to the Museum of Science

and the Boston Zoological Society.
He is also an assistant professor
at Tufts University School of Vet-

erinary Medicine. He is a graduate

of Cornell University.

Goldstein lives in Stoneham
and has been a member of the
Stoneham Zoo Advisory Council
since 1985.

“Ultimately Mark was just the
right person for what we needed
over the next few months," Bur—
gay said. »

Burgay said Goldstein will su-
pervise about $700,000 in infra-’
structure repairs at the two zoos,
oversee animal care and fill what

. nearly all perceive as a leadership

void at the zoos. The zoos are oper-
ated by the MDC, but animal care
is overseen by the Boston Zoologi—

’ cal Society.

Goldstein said he would prefer
to avoid the term interim director.
He said he is resigning from his
present job and intends to apply
for the top job at the zoos if the zoo
legislation passes and the new
corporation is established. Until
then, he said. he wants to be con-
sidered in charge of the transition.

“I don’t think it's too early to

have a leader." he said.

'Richard Bland. president of the

Boston Zoological Society board.

said. .-

William Donaldson. head of the
Philadelphia Zoological Society.
which was paid $300,000 recently
by the MDC to analyze problems
at the zoos. said Geary felt he
needed someone in charge until
the new corporation is in place.

But Donaldson said once state
funding'is in place. someone with
more experience running a zoo
should be found. “But for what
you’ve got there. he’s probably
overqualified,” Donaldson said,
adding that the metropolitan Bos-
ton zoos are “a disgrace to the zoo
business." '

Officials at the MDC and the
zoological society say they are sup-
portive of pending legislation that
would create a nonprofit corpora-
tion to run zoos around the state.
They said uniformly that, if the
bill fails to pass during this busy
legislative session, Goldstein's sta-
tus will be a moot point. .

Said Bland: “if this legislation

- or something like it doesn‘t pass
in the relatively near future. the
Boston Zoological Society will
probably recommend thatth'e
zoos be closed permanently." 7‘

MDC officials made the same

GRIT - 11/29-12/5/87

Pandas From China

Perform in San Dieg

By RAY mm
For GRIT .

Basi and Yuan Yuan, two of six giant
pandas belongingtotheFuz’houZooin
the Peoples’ Republic of China, ' have
taken up temporary residence at the
San Diego Zoo as part of a ZOO-day visit
to America. This marks their ﬁrst trip
out of China.

The two are not your basic pandas.
Basi (pronounced Ba-see) rides a
bicyle. Yuan Yuan (pronounced Yen-
Yen) performs on a balance board atop
a cylindrical form. They both stand and
walk on command, wave with either
paw and twirl a baton like cheerlead-

' ers. If that isn’t enough, they bounce
and slam-dunk a basketball, push a
[baby Stroller, sit at a table and play
cards, cuddle a tiny baby doll, and dem-
onstrate their strength by lifting bar
bells. Each animal consumes more than
10,000 pounds of bamboo in a single

. year. '

BASI and Yuan Yuan do more
than 15 feats under the supervision of
Chen Xiao Ling and Qiu Mei Lin, their
Fuzhou Zoo keepers. Panda exercise
sessions cannot be scheduled routinely,
but must take place when the roly—poly
animals are in the mood and after they
adjust to their temporary surroundings.
Mir exercise routine develops dexteri-

ty and balance and keeps the pandas
,. physically ﬁt and responsive to com-
mands. . ' *
The two pandas are accustomed to
humans. Chem, a veterinarian, is able
' to take their blood pressure, monitor
their heart beats, take temperatures
and collect blood samples.

“We applaud Mr. Chen’s pioneering
efforts to gather as muchscientiﬁc
background on the giant panda species
as possible,” says Dr. Arthur Risser,
-Jr., the San Diego Zoo’s general mana-
ger.”

Basi, a seven-year—old female, was

.r found in Baozing of Sichunan Province
«f when she was one-year old. She was

~ near starvation due to bamboo shortage
iand was nursed back to health

gentler than Yuan Yuan, a six-year-old

region. .

. The most serious threat to the panda
is a shortage of bamboo plants. The
Chinese government has setup large

servation message to San Diego. They
will charm visitors for 200 days and then
go back to their native country. The zoo
expects over 1.5 million persons to visit
the exhibit and watch the pandas per-
form daily.

Aretheybearsorraocoons?

Since scientists began studying
the rare animals, which have inhab-
ited China at least 2 million years,
a debate has raged over whether
pandas belong to the bear or the
raccoon family. They look more like
bears. Their eating habits resemble
those of raccoons. Unlike bears or
raccoons, however, giant pandas sit
like humans to eat their meals and
spend about 16 hours consuming up
to 40 pounds of bamboo a day.

“It was a bear for a while, and
then it started turning into a rac-
coon, and now evidence is suggest-
ing it’s a bear again,” Maple said.
“It sure as hell looks like a bear to
me.”

, Schaller, who has spent the last
three years studying wildlife on a

Tibetan plateau, said pandas appear ‘

to be more closely related to bears,

“but there are plenty of differ--

ences.”

< Whatever its family background,
’ the panda is not easily acquired for

Fla, import-export businessman
who four years ago conceived the
idea of a panda display at Busch
Gardens.

“It’s very difficult,” Rolquin"

said at the panda opening Tuesday.
“You have got what we call the
American way, and the Chinese
way. The Chinese way is 1,000 years
old, and you can’t go into China and
expect to do something in 30 sec-
onds. They will not do business with
you unless they trust you and unless
they feel comfortable with you.”

Zoo Atlanta has been working
on panda negotiations for 18
months, and a major breakthrough
came when former President Jim-
my Carter made an appeal on be-
half of the zoo during his trip to
China in June.

“That was the thing that turned
the key and made it happen quick-
ly,” said Maple, who expects the
panda display may double or triple
attendance. __

2 giant pandas respond
with a yawntohoopla
over new Florida home

By Me Hess
Staff Writer
TAMPA, Fla. — The trouble with captive giant
pandas is that they doze on the job all the time,
pretty much ignoring their duties as goodwill ambas-
sadors from China.

The beauty of the endangered creatures is that ‘
they could snooze all day and remain the leading "

tourist attraction at US. zoos with enough patience
and cash to acquire them. -

Ling Ling and Yong Yong, the sleeping beauties
of Busch Gardens’ new panda exhibit, turned on
their charm Tuesday in Tampa. State, local and Chi-
nese officials celebrated a multimillion dollar panda
loan program similar to, but more costly than, the
one negotiated by Zoo Atlanta for a 1988 panda
exhibit.

In the next six months, 2-year-old Ling Ling and
6-year-old Yong Yong will live in the air-conditioned
comfort of separate sky-lighted display cases fur-
nished with artificial rock formations and manufac-
tured waterfalls. They will eat stalks of bamboo, im-
ported weekly from a Savannah distributor, as well

pass relations and aiding efforts to
,geserve the species, which is
k reatened by diminishing bamboo

Ni said China has spent “mil-

glions” in the last decade to establish '

3a panda conservation program,

;; Busch Gardens officials said the
Alzheimer-Busch brewing company,
‘7 ﬁnch owns the attraction, made a
sizable contribution to China’s pan-
1 iii effort in return for the tempo-
my exhibition of Ling Lin , whose
name means “ringing be 1,” and
gong Yong, which signifies “forever
f fiend ever.” .
‘7': “The investment inthe panda
exhibit has been multimillion-dollar,
, hnquestionably,” said David Conrod,
spokesman at the zoo and theme
park, which charges $18.95 for ad-
mission. “I don’t think there’s a sin-
le department in the park that
asn’t been affected by the pandas.”
: Recent panda exhibits in San
Diego and New York have boosted
attendance at those parks 20 per-
nt to 50 rcent, said Thom Stork,
usch G ens marketing manager.
“The Tampa attraction, always in
gmpetition with several Florida
.. eme parks, hapes to do as well.
‘; In his 13 years at Busch Gar-

dens, Stork said, “this is the best
marketing adventure that I have
ever had.” .

It is a coup for Busch souvenir
sales. At the Panda Pavilion gift
shOp, peeple can buy panda pothold-
ers,’panda shot glasses, musical
panda calculators and even a $900
stuffed panda. One Miami tourist,
shocked that the gift Shep did not
have a panda license plate for sale,
helped assistant manager Steve
Brewer design one. . ~

“If one person asks for it, 10
more pe0ple want it,” Brewer said.

Since the pandas made their de-
but, employees and visitors have
been charmed by the rely-poly,
black and white animals.

“Everything they do is so cute,”

Conrod said. “They are ultra-cute. .
Sometimes they are almost too ;

cute.”

Christine Schleh, conservationj

specialist at the park, said the pan-
‘gias sometimes act like primates,
and sometimes “they remind me of
my dogs.”

. Pandas ‘neat’ but don’t move

With pigeon-toed paws, they
waddle from rock to rock. With a
sixth digit on their forepaws, they
grasp bamboo stalks and sit, child-
like, chomping for hours on end.

._ With resignation, they eye visitors
who pass on a pe0ple-mover just

.( yards away. -

, Richard Gober of Clearwater,

Fla., was one of the first Busch

Gardens visitors to see the pandas

Tuesday. Gober, an Atlanta native,
' said he liked what he saw. “But I
wish they were moving.”

A small Vermont visitor echoed
his reaction. “They’re kind of neat,”
5 said Tamara Benoit, 8. “They just

laid there”

One of the country’s leading
panda experts, George Schaller of
the Bronx Zoo, favors the panda
loan program but criticizes the iso-
lated exhibition of pandas such as

’ Yong Yong, who have the potential
; to be bred. The panda mating peri-
od lasts three days a year and new-
’ borns have a high death rate.

' “If you send a panda over here
and it sits alone in a cage on view
to the public when it should be
breeding, that’s terrible,” said ,

, Schaller, a wildlife biologist who

‘ worked with the World Wildlife

Fund in the early 19805 as the

group ironed out the current collab-

orative panda agreement with

China.

Terry Maple, director of Zoo At—
lanta, agrees with Schaller’s con-
cerns, and said he would not accept
a panda for the exhibit next fall if
it were determined it should be in a
breeding unit. -

“The problem is that we must
get the kind of “cooperation out of
the Chinese government to assure,
that that would be so,” Maple said»
“The No. 1 priority with all of us is
conservation of pandas in the wild.”

Chinese officials estimate fewer
than 1,000 pandas and possibly only
700 survive in the wet forests on
the eastern edge of the Himalayan
Mountains near the Chinese-Tibetan
border. Although pandas were hunt-
ed routinely, the Chinese now im-
f, pose heavy jail terms and fines for
; poaching. Hunters who are deter-

mined to have killed a panda on
purpose can receive the death pen- .
“alty, Schaller said.

The first panda came to the
United States in 1937 when Ruth
Harkness, widow of businessman
and panda admirer William Hark-
ness, returned from China with a
live baby panda named Su-Lin,
which she presented to Chicago’s
Brookfield Zoo.

this, the ammals can walk around do a hit of romping and even
bathe m a pond. They don’t need toys, George says.
Still, the giraffes do get a daily treat that makes eating almost a
treat. Every morning zoo keepers tie branches of leaves high up the
trunks of a few palm trees, barely within a giraffe’ s reach. In
, munch onthe leaves, the giraffes get m a good workout as well as .

“Here we have an animal with a long neck. If you don’t give him
something to stretch for, thOse muscles are going to get ﬂabby.”

It wouldn’t do to have giraffes with beer- belly necks.

 




One keeper once reported that the big apes even
have their own TV rating system. When a show airs
they disapprove of, they throw whatever’s handy at the
screen. So goes the rumor.

In any case, gorillas are hard to please. Orangutans
are different. They’re easily amused and can spend
hours examining the most ordinary object, in hopes of
ﬁnding some way of taking it apart.

They once took apart a series of cross beams in their
own outdoor living quarters, George says. The gang of
orange began regarding their exhibit as little more than
a big erector set shortly after it was ﬁrst built in 1975.

“These orange have so much strength in their hands,
they were able to back the bolts off, and they were able
to drsassemblethe exhibit.”

The bolts since have been welded into place. Now
the great apes are content to strip splinters off the
wooden planks cappingthe beams, hold them up and
subject them to intense scrutiny. Yes, orangutans are
easily amused.

So are elephants, though they’re too big to be left to
their own devices. Keepers spend several hours a day
teaching the three of them, one Asian and two African
species, how to be active without destroying half the
zoo. That’s time well spent when you consider these
creatures play with toys the size of tree trunks.

As a matter of fact, they are tree trunks, though
they’re not toys so much as exercise and dexterity aids,
George says.

“The keepers will give a command that the elephant

 

is to roll it or pick it up, carry it around and put it
down.”

When playtime’s over, Ruby, a 14-year-old Asian
elephant, sometimes takes to painting on canvas, with a
little help from her keepers. Brush in trunk, she slashes
across the canvas in large, bold strokes.

“She’s quite inspired,” George says. “She doesn’t do
houses, though.”

Animals at other Arizona zoos don’t have Ruby’s

. artistic license, but they do share her need for
occasional fun.

I Like the Phoenix Zoo, Wildlife World Zoo in
northwest Phoenix has few actual toys, just a little

_ something for the cats to teeth on.

. “The tiger cubs had a plastic pool, but they totalled
1t out,” says Tracy Fleschman of the 200’s visitor
servrces.

I In Tucson, three polar bears at Reid Park Zoo
catch some rays in their swimming pool by bobbing
atop aluminum beer kegs. And when the bears grow
bored with the kegs, they get to play with bowling balls
that have been purchased factory direct, without finger
holes a bear could catch a tooth on, director Steve

McCusker says.

Some balls float in the bears’ pond, and some sink.
No matter —- the bears simply swim to the bottom,
bring the ball up to the pool’s edge and bat it around
gong tlliere. Try as they might, the bears don’t chew up

“though it was a little unusual car-
rying such high-priority cargo.”

The highly insured haul -— offi-
cials wouldn’t disclose for how
much —— went without food or Ob-
servation by the veterinarian
aboard during the 21/2-hour flight,
said Gerald Lentz, the theme park’s
zoo manager.

“They had a breakfast of fruit,
panda bread and bamboo about 6:30
(Friday) morning,” he said.

Ken Thompson, Busch Garden’s
curator of large mammals, flew
along with Chinese representatives
that included veterinarian Zheng
Jinzhang and two panda handlers.

The craft landed shortly after
noon with a crowd of about 30 re-
porters and cameramen, six Chi-
nese delegates and two state troop-
ers waiting at the cargo building off
Bear Road.

Then the moment arrived. The
cargo door opened. “Oohs” and
“ahs” could be heard as press peo-
ple caught their first glimpse of the
187-pound Yong Yong.

She was less enthusiastic about
the attention, immediately turning
her dirty-white backside to the
crowd, as the green cage marked
“Beijing Zoo” moved slowly down a
conveyor belt to a waiting wagon
hitch.

Then came Ling Ling, the 119-
pound male, who looked sleepy-
eyed but curious as two cargo men
lifted his cage to the wagon.

Health-wise, the pandas looked
“very good,” said Dr. Zheng Jin-
zhang, who spoke through a Chinese
interpreter.

“As long as they’re moved prop—

erly,” said Busch Gardens staff vet-
erinarian John Olsen, there is no
health risk in ﬂying the pandas. He
said they go through more rigorous
activities in the wild.

The pandas then were transport-
ed to a lS-passenger van with the
seats removed in the back to make
room for the cages, and they were
off and running to Tampa.

Two state trooper cars escorted
the three-van convoy to Tampa with
Thompson, Jinzhang, his two assis-
tants and driver Mike Wels riding
along.

“We’re here to make sure
there’s no problems,” one of the
troopers said grimly.

There weren’t. Wels, bird cura-
tor at Busch Gardens, said he didn’t
play the radio or do anything “spe-
cial” for the trip, which went
smoothly.

Wels said he has transported
parrots, zebras and gazelles before,
but never pandas.

About 100 onlookers, mostly
from the media, awaited the arrival
of the pandas at 3 pm. near the
“brewery gate” of Busch Gardens.
The pandas appeared tired but oth-

erwise fine as they were converged
upon by photographers and then
carried in an oversize golf cart — in
their cages —- to the Panda House’s
back entrance.

Designed by an artificial-land-
scape firm in Arizona and located
in the bird section of the park, the
multimillion-dollar structure will
privately house the pandas until
Nov. 17, when Busch Gardens will
open its doors for public viewing of
the animals.

The Bronx Zoo paid the Chinese
government $1 million to showcase
the pandas for six months. Though
Busch Gardens officials won’t dis-
close how much they are paying for
the pandas, it likely is a similar
amount.

A contract for three months is
firm with additional time possible.
“We hope to get a three-month ex-
tension on keeping them,” Gilmore
said.

There are fewer than 750 pan»
das in the entire world, and only 15
or 16 of them are outside China.
Four of the black-and-white, bear-
like animals reside in the United
States.

isn’t going to be caught with its pan-
das down. The theme park wiii sell
panda pens, mugs and even a $200
stuffed bear.

Busch also arranged with Bay
Area Precious Metals, 4209 E.
Busch Blvd., for the minting and
sale of silver coins commemorating
the panda visit.

The coins selling for $30 each at

the park and store show a panda
eating a bamboo shoot on one side
and the Anheuser-Busch logo on the
other.

Of the 5,000 coins being pro-
duced at a Highlands County mint,
about 4,000 have been presold to
panda lovers and coin collectors
who consider them a sure invest-
ment, said Chester Harvey at the
metals store.

At the Swiss Chalet gift shop

across from the park, Jim Boggs is
stocking up on T-shirts, stuffed
bears and panda figurines, light
switch plates and makeup mirrors.

“Anything I’ve seen that I like in
panda bears, I’ve bought,” said
Boggs, a former sales managerfor
Busch Gardens.

But he drew the line at a panda
beanie a peddler brought into his
store. The furry-eared creation was
a tad tacky. Boggs said.

Can Tampa bear it?

ORLANDO -—- Contrary to expec-
tations, visiting pandas Ling Ling
and Yong Yong didn’t fly first class
on their trip Friday from La Guard-
ia Airport in New York to Orlando
International Airport.

They did, however, arrive safe
and secure in Orlando, and in Tam-
pa’s Busch Gardens, their final des-
tination — but only after panda-
monium that could be likened to a
visit from the president and first la-
dy.

The pair of pandas, on their way
to a contracted three-month stay at
the amusement park’s newly built
Panda House, flew silently in an
air-controlled cargo hold of an East-
ern Airlines passenger jet.

the pandas, who had ended their'

six-month stay at the New York
Zoological Park in the Bronx.

“We tried to get them to be
flown first class,” said Glenda Gil-
more, public relations director of
Busch Gardens, “but no airlines
would touch it.”

The flight was scheduled for ar-
rival in Orlando because no air-con-
trolled cargo jets were flying into
Tampa, Gilmore said.

Ling Ling, a 11/2-year-old male,
and Yong Yong, a 6-year-old fe-
male, flew unbeknown to regular
passengers on the LIO-ll jet.

“I was asked not to tell them
(the passengers) in order to avoid a
scene,” said Capt. Ed White, who pi-
loted the craft. “The flight went
smooth all the way,” he said,

TAMPA -- From punch to light-switch plates,
merchants are pushing new products as panda-ma-
nia reigns at Busch Gardens with the arrival of Ling
Ling and Yong Yong.

Besides buying panda T-shirts, Yong Yong and
Ling Ling lovers will be able to slurp Panda Punch
at an area hotel, throw a stuffed panda into a gro-
cery shopping cart or even invest in a limited-edi-
tion panda coin.

“We’ve got un—bear—ably great hotel packages,”
said Susan Menard-Machin at the Safari Resort Inn,
where the marquee out front provides a countdown
of the days until the pandas’ Nov. 17 debut at Busch
Gardens.

And the hotel’s bar manager, Davino Farino, has

chin tasted a sample: “It’s kind of like a Singapore
Sling, a gin and fruity drink.” A non-alcoholic ver-
sion will be available for children.

getting, he said.

Yong Yong, whose name means
“forever and ever,” was found
starving at the age of approximately
11 months. She was rescued by a
farmer near the mountains of Si-
chuan and turned over to a wildlife
reserve. .

This is not Yong Yong’s first vis-
it to the United States. In 1984 she
and another panda, Ying Xin, spent
31/2 months in the Los Angeles zoo
and two months in the San Francis-
co zoo.

Yong Yong is 6 years old. She
weighs 187 pounds. And on this
brisk fall morning she is first in the
amphitheater.

Ling Ling, the male whose name
means “ringing bell,” was con-
ceived through artificial insemina-
tion and born at the Beijing 200. He
will come out around lunchtime,
when Yong Yong goes inside. Ling
Ling weighs approximately ‘119
pounds and is 1% years old.

The two giant pandas made
their debut at the Bronx Zoo April
30. Since then, more than 1 million
people have gone to see them, an
increase of about 30 percent over

normal attendance at the zoo.

“About 690,000 adults and over

. 358,000 school children,” says Cath-

erine Belden, a zoo representative.

‘ “The panda exhibit has brought new

. people to the zoo who might not
‘ have come here before.”

Gentle, chiming Oriental music
greets visitors as they arrive at the
panda exhibit area.

They pass through a large Chi-
nese-style archway and walk down
a path that is shaded by a canopy of
red flags bearing Chinese writing.

Surrounded by tall white pine,
locust and maple trees interspersed
with stands of bamboo, the glade is
an oasis of peace.

NEW YORK — A crisp, cold
wind blows through the trees, scat-
tering golden red and russet maple
leaves down on Yong Yong. But
Yong Yong is oblivious.

The giant panda is languidly
sprawled over a tangle of tree limbs
— fast asleep 10 feet off the ground.

“Daddy, when is she going to do
something?” asks 5-year-old Benita
Zivel.

As if on cue, Yong Yong stretch-
es, yawns and props a hind leg up
against the tree trunk.

“Oohs” and “Ahhhs” break out.
A smattering of applause ripples
through the crowd in the tiered
viewing area of the panda habitat at
the Bronx Zoo.

This is the last weekend pandas
Yong Yong and Ling Ling will be on
exhibit at the Bronx Zoo.

Tampa’s Busch Gardens has
paid to rent the pandas from the
Beijing Zoo in China. While Busch
officials have refused to say how
much they are paying for the short-
term rental, the Bronx Zoo paid
more than $1 million for a six-
month exhibit.

Zoologists say fewer than 750
pandas are living today, and only
four are on display in the United
States.

The pandas are expected to ar-
rive in Tampa Nov. 6 and will go on
public display at Busch Gardens in
a multimillion-dollar exhibit area
Nov. 17, according to Glenda Gil-

ore, head of public relations.

LOS ANGELES TIMES - October 26, 1987

LA. Gorilla Megillah Leaves Cincinnati

By STEVEN ROSEN

CINCINNATI—It was an extraordi-
nary event for the Cincinnati Zoo: a

, commemorative service for King Tut, a

38-year-old, 450-pound gorilla that had
lived in the zoo since 1952. He had been
captured wild in Africa.

When he died Oct. 6 after dental
surgery, zoo officials quickly called the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural
History, which long has wanted the
carcass of a dominant male gorilla for
display purposes. A deal had been struck
in 1975 that, upon the death of King Tut,
the carcass would go to the LA. museum.

Now, King Tut’s carcass is in a freezer

: . in Los Angeles, awaiting the skinning

process, and a lot of people in Cincinnati

are angry. They want their beloved

- gorilla kept and honored in their home—

town.

Why shouldn’t he be put on display
here? they ask. Here, he had sired four
offspring and is considered the patriarch
of the 200’s gorilla family (there have
been 23 since 1970), and is widely
admired by the populace. In Los Angeles,
he means nothing to the public, they say.

The Cincinnati City Council passed a
unanimous resolution seeking the return
of King Tut’s remains for suitable display.

'80 the zoo, feeling some pressure,
realized the public felt a friend had died.

 

EORILLA: Display Opposed

die in good condition,” Bovard said.

1 “An animal like. that is invaluable.
‘He has a real nice coat of hair.”
' Indeed, Bovard flew to Cincinnati
- the night of the gorilla’s death, and

brought the wrapped and crated
carcass back to Los Angeles the
next day on a commercial flight.
The museum is now proceeding
witha $750,000 renovation of its

' animal dioramas, including the rain

forest where King Tut is to be

displayed. Keller estimates it will

be finished in 1989. ’
While King Tut spent much of

‘ his life in a cage inside the 200’s ape

housg, he moved outdoors in 1978.
Then" the zoo opened its $4—million
outdoor Gorilla World exhibit and
King“, Tut dominated it. He also
dominated the zoo’s other 18 goril-
las. Whenever the animal would
slowly emerge from his cave, his
silver back sparkling, younger and
smal er gorillas would scurry
away.

“They have respect for him,”
said Gertrude Meyer, 70, a long-
time zoo visitor who presented the
cit)? with a 170-name petition pro-
testing the gorilla’s sudden depar-
ture.

“.You have to admire anyone who
gets-“respect in his old age. They
could have kept him here.” Be-

. sides, she said, “what’s to say with

all the earthquakes [in Los Angel-

‘ es], he won’t go down the drain

eventually?

“I hear they’re going to have a
plaque that says the people of
Cincinnati have given him to the
museum. The people? What did the
people have to say about it?”

Meanwhile, there was other op-
position. Even some of the 200’s 900
volunteer workers, such as Hope
Nettleton, complained publicly
about King Tut’s departure to Los
Angeles.

Zoo director Maruska acknowl-
edged that he should have foreseen
this backlash. And, he said, he has a
difficult time as a scientist trying to
respond to it.

“Scientifically, we made the
right decision,” Maruska said.
“Emotionally, we may not have,
but we have to go with science.

“There would be nothing. gained
by bringing him back. We’d proba-
bly have him on display in a glass
case and then put him in a back
room, carted out every once in a
while.”

Perhaps, if there may be a
compromise in this, it might be in
the suggestion of Cincinnati City

Councilman Guy Guckenberger. '
He sponsored the reSolution calling ~

for King Tut’s return. If that’s not
possible or in the best interest of

science, Guckenberger said, maybe -
he could just come back now and .

then for a visit.

And it had to somehow acknowledge that
grieving. Last week’s commemorative
service along with the planting of a
dogwood tree near the Gorilla World

- outdoor exhibit, was the way.

Before about 35 people, zoo director
Edward Maruska said, “We all certainly
will miss this animal. The king is dead,
long live the king,” and he reiterated he
had made the right decision in letting
King Tut leave. “Tut left a heritage in
Cincinnati, but he left it in his offspring.”

Meanwhile in Los Angeles, museum
officials wait for the outcry to pass and
hope Cincinnatians will realize the gorilla
will be part of a first-class exhibition.

“1 can understand why there would be
strong feelings about keeping him in ‘
Cincinnati,” said Peter Keller, the muse-/
um’s associate director for public pro-
grams. “But we’re pretty famous around
the world for our animal dioramas. The
gorilla will figure prominently in our rain
forest section, and Cincinnati will take

. credit."

For almost 15 years, the museum has
wanted to include a “big, mature male"
gorilla in its African exhibit, said Tim
Bovard, museum taxidermist. «

THE CYCLORA MA AND 200 ATLANTA

Stalking History and the Wild in Atlanta

the Cyclorama and Zoo Atlanta are as much a pan
of the lore of Atlanta as Peachtree Street and Mag-
nolia blossoms. For many residents and visitors,
these two Grant Park-based institutions are the epit-
ome of what an old-fashioned family day in Atlanta
should be.

For over 90 years, 200 Atlanta-the ninth oldest
zoo in the United States—has delighted generations

    

of sightseeing tourists and natives alike with a gag-
gle of wild beasts of every description. But things
are changing at Zoo Atlanta, and decidedly for the
better. In fact, during the next four to six years, Zoo
Atlanta officials fully expect their facility to rank as
one of the world’s best city zoo environments.
That impending transformation, in fact, is al—
ready evident. Sparked by the Friends of Zoo At-

lanta, the local business community and various
City officials, a non-profit corporation called the
Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority (AF-
C RA )was formed in l983 to spearhead a massive
renovation and public relations campaign. The re-
sult is soaring attendance and a dramatic increase in
Friends of Zoo Atlanta memberships.

What’s all the excitement about? For starters,
there’s the new Flamingo Plaza, a stunningly land-
scaped habitat for nearly 60 Chilean ﬂamingoes,
which is part of the initial phase of the $25 million
renovation project scheduled to be completed at the
37-acre zoo during the next few years.

Besides Flamingo Plaza, the initial phase of the
project also includes a new entryway, a ZOO-seat
restaurant, a 2500-square—foot gift shop and new
visitor services and utilities. Key support for this
part of the project was supplied by Vantage South-
east (a real estate development company), The Trav—
elers and Contel Credit.

Designed by Turner Associates and Coe Lee Ro—
binson (architects and exhibit/landscaping design-
ers, respectively), the new Zoo Atlanta is being
redeveloped as a “zoological park”, emphasizing
“naturalized” habitats for the animals. The overall
goal, according to Zoo Atlanta officials, is to ‘ ‘sim-
ulate various regions of the world" within the zoo.
Barriers between visitors and the animals will be
virtually invisible, creating what officials call “the
illusion of excitement and danger . . . one would ex»
perience encountering gorillas, lions, rhinos, ele-
phants and other animals in the wild.”

Excitement is understandably high at Zoo At-
lanta, a fact made all the more obvious by the col-
orful brochures and spirited sense of camaraderie
emanating from Zoo Atlanta headquarters these
days. As well they should. An entertaining and fas-
cinating experience now, 200 Atlanta will get pro-
gressively more so in the months to come.

Some of the new exhibits scheduled to take
shape: The Ford African Rain Forest, featuring go—
rillas, mandrills, arboreal monkeys and birds of the
rain forest; The African Savanna, which will feature
giraffes, zebras, antelopes, lions, caracals and
birds; Mzima Springs, for elephants, hippos and
Nile crocodiles; The South American Rain Forest,
with primates, birds and reptiles.

For people curious about native Georgia and

GO-The Authentic Guide to Atlanta

Southern wildlife, there‘ll be The Okefenokee
Swamp, with cougars, bears, otters, alligators and
birds; and The Georgia Coastal Marsh, featuring
marine life and birds. Other exhibits feature oran-
gutans, gibbons, polar bears, seals, puffins and sea
lions. There will also be an exhibit for domesticated
animals from around the world, as well as the al-
ready popular Children’s Zoo, or “petting” zoo to
use the popular vernacular.

Also part of Grant Park, Atlanta’s Cyclorama is
a breathtakingly dramatic recreation of Atlanta’s
Civil War tribulations, a “living history program
which is as remarkable for its aesthetic qualities as
it is for its obvious archival value.

The facility houses a l00-year-old cylindrical oil
painting which, combined with three-dimensional
props and a stirring audio narration, gives the
viewer the uncanny sensation of actually being in
the middle of the Battle of Atlanta. As the audience
sits on a revolving stage, the Battle unfolds in an al—
most animated fashion, with the eerie sound of can—
non fire surging and fading in the distance.

Commissioned in 1885-86 by a Milwaukee stu-
dio owner named William Wehner, the painting was
bought at an auction in 1893 by Atlantan George V.
Gress, who presented it to the City of Atlanta five
years later. The painting was installed in its present
Grant Park location in l92l; later, through a WPA
grant, the exhibit was made three-dimensional with
the addition of blasted tree stumps, bushes, and life-
like plaster figures of Confederate and Union
soldiers.

Adults who may have let two decades pass since
they last saw the painting nevertheless remain awe-
struck by its realism.

Three hundred tifty~eight feet in circumference
and 42 feet high, the painting weighs more than
9,000 pounds and occupies an area of more than
l5,000 square feet—a fact, officials point out, which
makes this amazing exhibit equivalent in size to a
football field. Truly an overwhelming sight to
behold.

Although the Battle of Atlanta exhibit is the cen-
terpiece of the Cyclorama, there’s more to this fa—
cility. Also included is the locomotive Texas, from
the Andrews Raid museum. There are also other ex-
hibits and period pieces.

Zoo Atlanta and the Cyclorama are certainly two

from their mother for reasons ex-
plained by the principle of survival
of the fittest. by which these ani-
mals operate in the wild.

"Their mother got sick, and the
rest of the monkeys started to at-
tack the mother and her babies,"
said Michele Whitehouse, 25. of
Reading, Pa. "In thewild, sick ani-
mals are driven out. It’s instinct. So
we had to raise them."

 

 

No holidays

The students, too, have to be fit
to survive their regimen.

“We have to be hard on them.”
said Doria. “The animals don’t get
holidays, and that’s the reality
these students must face if they
want to go on in the business.”

The students. who receive an
AS. degree if they complete the
rigorous two-year course, aren‘t
just in for a free ride in an exotic
animal compound.

Only 50 percent graduate from
each class. Most are daunted by the
relentless nature of this type of
work -—» no holidays. seven days a
week on call, and long hours. There
is no time for extra jobs or much of

of animals donated by private citi-

Watching carefully over them is

ing specialized instruction in the
techniques of zookeeping and a va-

According to Doria. Moorpark-

working in zoos in Atlanta; Green-
ville, SC; Bowmanville, Ontario;
Las Vegas, Phoenix, Portland, Mi-
ami, San Diego and Santa Barbara.
They are working with marine

Animals at the Moorpark facility
have appeared in “Quest for Fire, ‘

Vulture loses job

Angelina the timber wolf was
used in the movie “Never Cry
Wolf.“ Schmoo the sea lion was in
the movie “Golden Seal.“ and Pup-
py the turkey vulture was in the

 

 

movie “Airplane,” sitting on the:
shoulder of actor Peter Graves

when the plane was going to crash.
Doria doubts that the movies will
come calling for Puppy again.

“It‘s the end of her career," said
Doria. “When filming she vomited
and urinated and defecated. They
weren‘t very happy. But that was
just a form of defense.”

The job of caring for these won-
derful animals is not only unglamo
rous. it is truly dangerous as well.

Doria sadly recalls that one grad-
uate was killed at the Bronx Zoo in
New York, mauled by two tigers.

Because of an accident several
years ago. students are not allowed

to work with the lions, tigers, jag-
uars, cougars and other big cats.
But they do observe training tech-
niques used by professionals on the
big cats and apply the same condi—
tioning techniques on chickens,
monkeys and other small animals.

"The same techniques I am using ';
on the little animals will help me 1

when I finally get to work with
bigger animals," Beal said.
“Now I go out with Animal Ac-

tors of Hollywood as many times as ‘,
I can to learn the business,” he said. .

 

Safety ﬁrst

“Because it’s a school, we stress

 

safety probably more than any oth-
er facility," said Doria. “That‘s be
cause of insurance, and because
students don‘t know the animals
yet. And because unless you are
experienced, you may think a wild
animal is cute, but it‘s still quite
wild."

“People anthropomorphize a
lot," said Whitehouse, who said she
hepes to open her own facility
eventually to breed endangered
species. “People think the animal is
smiling because it's showing its
teeth. but it‘s actually a sign it
wants to attack."

While the Ventura County Com-

munity College District gives the
facility funds to operate, the Exotic
Animal Training and Management
program must earn about $70,000
per year through educational ani-
mal shows and petting zoos.

The money pays for food for the
animals and veterinary bills. which
are obviously high.

Visiting animals
animate patients
in pet therapy

By Eugene Morris
Staff Writer

On most days, Martha McGourik lies in
bed at the Fairburn Health Care Center either
sleeping or staring blankly into space. Nor-
mally, she doesn‘t say much to her roommate
or to nursing home personnel.

' When she does speak, Mrs. McGourik, 89,
often reminisces about her childhood and her
love for animals. As a child, she had pets. To
day, she shares her bed with a stuffed feline
she calls “Kitty Cat.” Make-believe pets are
nice to cuddle, she said, but they hardly fill
the void like real animals.

So Mrs. McGourik is one of hundreds of
patients in area nursing homes, mental health
wards and other health-care facilities who are
treated with monthly visits by animals from
the Atlanta Humane Society. The humane so-

cieties in Cobb, DeKalb and Rockdale counties also
provide animals for similar therapy programs.

Physicians call it pet therapy. Humane Society
employees call it “animal magnetism.” The patients
call it fun.

“I love them because they make me feel good,”
Mrs. McGourik said, a single tear sliding down her
cheek as she petted a feisty stray puppy scampering
about her bed. “I love to hug and kiss them and
watch them play around.”

When the animals arrive at the nursing home,
the facility resembles a school cafeteria at lunch-
time. The patients talk and scold and rub the furry
creatures and giggle like children. Patients who have
been sheltered in their rooms come into the hallway.
Those who haven’t spoken Open up. Those in wheel-
chairs roll themselves toward the animals. Even
nurses and orderlies scramble to caress the animals.

Medical tests have proved that contact with ani-
mals reduces stress and lowers the heart rate, Often
times. chronically depressed patients who won‘t
speak to physicians or other patients will communi-
cate with animals.

“When peeple feel isolated or lonely about a loss
of family or friends or health or independence. the
animals serve as a sort of stimulation." said Marga-
ret Anderson, a gerontological clinical nurse at
Crawford Long Hospital. “Sometimes there‘s more of
a tendency of [the patients] responding to pets who
are warm and friendly and not as threatening as
humans."

MEMPHIS COWIPERCIAL APPEAL - November 14, 1987'

“it'l‘tnimal research offers
spinal cord repair hope

 

The New York Times News Service

 

NEW YORK —— Scientists report that for the first
time they have repaired crushed nerves connect-
ing the extremities to the spinal cord in mammals,
in this case rats.

They said the key to their success was implant-
ing a “living bridge” of fetal cells that guided the
regrowth of the injured nerves.

Application to humans, if it ever comes, is a long
way off, but the animal research is pointing the
way toward treatment of what are now intractable
neurological problems that can arise from acci-
dents or ruptured disk’s. These neurological prob-
lems can cause anything from a loss of sensation
to loss of use of feet, legs, hands or arms.

Scientists hope hoped application of the same
principles might eventually lead to treatment of
more common, more debilitating injuries to the
spinal cord itself. For now, regeneration of the spi-
nal cord is elusive.

The work, by Dr. Jerry Silver of Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland and Dr. Michel
Kliot of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New
York, is the first to show that nerves can be recon-
nected into the spinal cord and function again
after injury.

Silver will be presenting the findings on Mon-
day at a meeting in New Orleans sponsored by the
Society for Neuroscience. He has previously dis-
cussed his work with colleagues and described his
work at small scientific meetings.

The key to success, Kliot explained, was Silver’s
discovery that he could make a bridge of fetal cells
that guide the damaged nerves so they can regrow
to form appropriate connections to the spinal
cord. These cells are particularly useful, the re-

searchers said, because their function in the fetus
is to help guide the growth of nerves.

Regeneration of the spinal cord itself after in-
jury, a far more complex challenge, remains an
elusive goal. But Kliot said it was “not out of the
question.” With the new findings, he said, “We
have taken the first step on the road that, hopeful-
ly, will allow us to treat injuries to the spinal
cord.”

In the past, researchers trying to find ways to
make injured nerves grow back into the spinal
cord were frustrated because they could not get
the nerves to grow past a large scar that occurs
just at the entrance to the cord when nerves are
injured. When Silver and Kliot implanted their
living bridge of fetal cells at the site of the nerve
injury, a large scar did not form and the nerves
could grow into the cord.

In their animal studies: Silver and Kliot injured :
nerves that, in humans, supply sensation to the ;
big toe. In rats, Kliot explained, the nerves supply :
a slightly larger portion of the foot, including sev- -
eral toes. The nerves travel from the toes to a sort
of cable of nerves called the nerve root. The nerve
root is connected to the spinal cord.

The scientists damaged the nerves by crushing
the nerve root just outside the spinal cord. As a
consequence, the animals lost all feeling in sever—
altoes.

Then the scientists implanted a dagger—shaped
piece of a porous paperlike material covered with
spinal cord cells taken fromrat fetuses.

These fetal cells are those that nerves grow on to
“form nerve fiber highways in the developing fe-
tus,” Silver explained.

The nerves just beyond the injury regrew along
the bridge and into the spinal cord, resulting in
restored feeling in the toes of seven of the 15 rats,

Raid of shelter finds
many pets sick, emaciated

Sheriff’s deputies and animal control officers
broke down the doors of two East Side duplexes
Monday and removed 87 cats, many of them sick
and emaciated. ‘ ‘

The raid was carried out at the Full Bowl cat
shelter, operated by James and Bobbie Bruflat
at1609,1611,1613 and 1615 E. Royall Pl.

Officials who entered the home came armed
with an eviction notice. The properties had been
sold and the Bruflats had been ordered to clear
out, said William Loeffler, manager of operations
of the Wisconsin Humane. Society.

“The place is a mess. You walk on two inches
of solid cat crap.” he said. “And there were some
dead cats there. We saw a minimum of four.”

Other cats remain in the homes. Live traps
will be set to catch them.

It took more than three hours to clear the
87 cats from the premises. The animals were
taken to the Humane Society, 4151 N. Humboldt
Blvd., where each cat was checked by a
veterinarian.

“Some are nothing but skin and bones,”
Loeffler said.

Some of the cats have a respiratory disease,
some have fleas and some have mange, which
is an ectoparasite, said Humane ‘Society
spokesman Leon Nielsen.

“There are just a number of ailments with
them that our veterinarian is dealing with,”
Nielsen said.

The doors of the duplexes were knocked open
with a sledge hammer because the owner said
he had no keys. Loeffler said.

On Aug. 30, 1984, 179 cats were taken from
the same shelter and the Bruflats were charged
with mistreatment of animals.

Prosecution was deferred and 80 cats were
returned to the couple with the understanding
that no more than that would be sheltered there. ,

The couple was to pay the Humane Society
about $22,000 for caring for the cats at a rate
of $1.50 per cat per day, Loeffler said.

They did not, he said, and the society put a
lien against the property, which forced the
Bruflats to sell it.

The new owner found another buyer and
served an eviction notice on the shelter operators.
In April 1985, the Bruflats were fined $300
for failure to have a pet store license and animal

fancier permit.

January 1988

Q: Why can’t this veal calf walk?

A: He has only two feet.

Actually, l_es_s than two feet. Twenty two inches to be
exact His entire life is spent chained in a wooden box
measuring only 22 inches wide and 56 inches long. The
box 15 so small that the calf can t walk or even turn
around.

Most people think animal abuse is illegal. It isn’t. ln
veal factories, its business as usual. “Milk-fed” veal

is obtained by making a calf anemic. The calf is not
fed mother‘s milk. He's fed an antibiotic laced formula
that causes severe diarrhea. He must lie in his own
excrement—choking on the ammonia gases. He’s
chained in a darkened building with hundreds of other
baby calves suffering the same fate. All immobilized,

sick, and anemic.
Toxic Veal

The reckless use of
oxytetracycline, mold
inhibiting chemicals,
chloramphenicol,
neomycin, penicillin,
and other drugs is not
just bad for calves. It
is toxic to you.

Chloramphenicol has
caused fatal bone marrow disease in people. USDA warns
that Chloramphenicol 15 used 1n veal calves and that
“detection is extremely difficult."

 

Antibiotics in veal and other factory farm products create
virulent strains of bacteria that wreak havoc on human
health. Salmonella food poisoning is reaching epidemic
proportions.

Veal factories maximize profits for agribusiness drug
companies because they are a breeding ground for
disease. .To keep calves alive under such torturous
conditions, they are continually given drugs which are
passed on to consumers.

It doesn’t have to be this way. And with your help, it
won’t be. Please, don’t buy veal!

NATIONAL ENQUIRER - January 5, 1988

 

Phone-In Poll

Should Pound Animals Be Used for

 

Should pound animals be used for
medical research?

No, says Rep. Robert J. Mrazek
(D.-N.Y.), sponsor of a bill to pre-
vent animals from being taken from
animal shelters for laboratory use.

Yes, insists famed heart pioneer
Dr. Michael DeBakey. The two ex-

 

perts debate the issue below. Then
you have the opportunity to tell us
what you think in an ENQUIRER j
telephone poll. 2
As soon as the results are in, we’ll
publish them.
As usual, The ENQUIRER takes
no sides in the poll.

 

YES

 

 

They 've Enabled Me to Develop

lifesaving De vices for Humans

 

 

Dear ENQUIRER reader:

Had the animal legislation
now pending in Congress been
enacted when I began my ca-
reer, it would have :"
prevented me from
developing a number
of lifesaving proce-
dures in my research
laboratory.

I could not have devel-
oped the “roller” pump
that made open heart sur-
gery possible, or the arti-
ficial artery that restor-
ed health to previously
doomed patients with an-
eurysms. Nor could we
have attempted the first successful
artery bypass, nor implanted the
first temporary mechanical heart,
with which we saved a patient’s life
two decades ago.

Dr. DeBakey

Each year, 10 million to 15 million
unwanted dogs and cats are killed in
pounds. Medical research needs ap-

proximately 200, 000 of these animals

—- or less than 2 percent
: of those killed.

Prohibiting use of
pound or shelter ani-
mals will not save the
lives of these animals -- 3
it will merely require
that these animals be
killed, while we breed
additional ones for re
search use, at additional
cost to taxpayers.

If those self-appoint-
ed guardians of animal
rights are permitted to

continue their stranglehold on medi-
cal research, we shall watch help-
lessly as families, friends and fellow
citizens fall victim to diseases whose
prevention or cure we were not al-

N 0 We Shoo/cl Use Animals That Are
Bred Speciﬁcally for Research

Dear ENQUIRER reader, a. a»:
We must prohibit research projects using w? ‘ '
animals from animal pounds and shelters. ‘
While it is true that many pound animals are . '1 ,
destined to die, I believe most pet owners would ‘ *‘ ,
choose rapid and humane euthanasia for their pets ..
rather than the possibility that their beloved dog or ‘
cat could end up as the subject of biomedical re-
search. .
There are documented cases where pets which
were lost were sold for biomedical research, even , . '
though their owners were desperately searching for W
them.
Giving up a pet is almost always a very painful de-
cision to make. It is rarely easy for a pet owner to sur-
render an animal to a commuJ '

Already, a wing at the Tufts
University School of Veterinary
Medicine in North Grafton is
named for T hibeault. honoring
his volunteer work with the New
England Board of Higher Educa-
tion. That work led to the opening
of the Tufts unit in 1979. the first
veterinary school in New England
since the 19405. ‘

“Connie" Thibeault. who an-
swers to “just plain T-Bo." is still
hale and hearty, and he goes
about his practice in semiretire—

ment at his rolling farm here with
uncommon energy. It was only
three years ago that he deferred to
his age and gave up riding, a life-
long love, although he still keeps
horses and a collection of antique
buggies and carriages. '

He maintains an aviary and
enjoys showing visitors his collec-

tion of rare birds. among them a» ‘

lame golden Chinese pheasant

found injured on a Boston street.

In his Honduran leather hat. '
old corduroy pants and tennis
shoes. Thibeault still tends cats.
0 dogs, horses and any other animal,
in need of help with the gentleness
of a doctor tending a child?

“He's got these great big Xoray
hands that can feel exactly where
an animal’s problem is." said
Judy Gordon of Newburyport.
who has been working with Th1—

beault far 12 years. “I’ve seen him
do about a million spays. They are
quick with barely noticeable inci-
sions. and the animal is on her

feet and out of here in seconds.”

Thibeault’s career spans al-
most six decades. and in itself is a
history of the progress of the pro—
fession in the eradication of ani-
mal diseases and their threat to
humans.

“1 came from Cape Ann in

Rockport. and I thought it would
be great to go out of the country to
school and see something differ-
ent, so I decided on the University
of Toronto," Thibeault said. At
the time. he said, there were not
‘ many veterinary schools “because
after World War 1 in 1918, a lot of
veterinary schools began to cut
down on their facilities and facul-
ties because horses were going out
. and cars were coming in.”

_ During two years at Toronto.
Thibeault got excellent marks and
7 was popular enough to be a stu-
: dent leader. But a student prank
if was his undoing.

“As freshmen,” he recalled.

1 again with a chuckle. ”we had to

 

 

: go around for three months wear-

ing our clothes inside out and car-
ry the humerus bone of a horse.
Well. we had this visiting profes-
sor from Europe, and I thought he
should do the same thing. When
he didn’t agree. I tossed him into
the pool with all his clothes on."

The university made life so
miserable for him after the prank,
Thibeault said, that he trans-4
ferred to Ohio State.

“What do you think tuition
was then?” he asked. “It was $90
a year and $10 a week for room
and board. That compares to
$20,000 a year now. and you sup-
ply your own room and board.”

Thibeault graduated from Ohio

State in 1929, and his first prac-
tice was in Reading.

“It was during the Depression.
You’d make farm calls and you'd

‘ get your fees in a couple of dozen
’ of eggs or a basket of spinach.” he
‘ recalled. .

At that time. Thibeault served

2 on the Reading Board of Health. A

big part of veterinarians’ work
then - before the widespread pas-
teurization of milk - was with a
federal program to eliminate tu-
berculosis in cows.

“We worked for $1 a day and 4
cents a mile for our car.” Thi-
beault said. “Office visits were
$1.50, and it cost $5 to spay an
animal and $3 for the hospital
bill."

He said the veterinary profes-
sion should get credit for “work-
ing for pennies all those years to
clean up the infectious diseases of
all animals. such as tuberculosis.
hog cholera and rabies."

ln tribute to Thibeault's work
in that area, a yellowed citation
from the Legislature hangs on the
wall of his combination animal
clinic. operating room and tack
room.

Thibeault also served as an ap-
pointee of for’ﬁ‘ier Gov. Robert
Bradford on a committee that set
standards for the humane treat-

ment of animals in laboratories.
During the administration of

President Dwight Eisenhower. ‘

Thibeault was sent to study ani-

mal care in Eastern European .

countries.

For a number of years. Thi- .I

beault practiced in Wakefield on a
10-acre estate he said he bought
during the Depression for a song.

“When I had my practice in '-

Wakefield, Middlesex County was
the largest hog-raising area in the
United States. So we used to vacci—

nate thousands of pigs for hog '

cholera every year," he said.

In Wakefield. Thibeault had 21
preceptors. or interns, and his
hospital was open seven days and
seven nights a week.

“1 was never a great surgeon.”
Thibeault said, ”but I taught the
young people who worked for me
to first recognize the common or-
dinary everyday things and then
to learn how to treat them and to
leave the big jobs like back sur-
gery . . . to the experts. That‘s the
key to success."

He recalled the early days of his
practice. when veterinarians had
to treat animals without the bene-
fit of anesthesia or antibiotics.
Anesthesia came into use in the
1930s; antibiotics in the 19403
and 1950s.

. Thibeault was once bitten by a
rabid dog and had to have 20 in-
jections. which he gave to himself.’

He recalled that in the early
:lays. bona fide veterinarians had

.to combat an adverse public im-
age caused by quacks. He recalled
one such quack who. on encoun-
tering a rabid dog in someone’s
home, “took out his gun and shot
the‘dog on the spot in the kitch- ‘
en.

Such behavior is not tolerated
today, Thibeault said. and veterin-
arians have contributed not only
to the advancement of veterinary
medicine but to human medicine.

“When 1 was in school in To-
ronto,” he said, “we were taught
that you could not invade the ab-
dominal cavity of an equine be- 1
cause everyone thought the knife
would give the horse peritonitis.
Today. they do colic surgery, take
20 feet of the intestines out of a
horse and do Caesareans on
mares that deliver foals.”

Thibeault said that hip res
placements in dogs helped ad-
vance the same operation in hu-
mans and that eye surgery on col-
lies. congenitally affected by de-

tached retinas, has enhanced sur—
gical procedures on the human
eye.

Asked if he had any regrets
about his chosen profession, Thi-
beault said. “Absolutely not.
You're put on this earth to do
something for pe’iiple and. it seems
to me. helping them take care of
their animals is doing just that."

Ms. Nurmikko says the animals are
well cared for, thanks to a dedicated
staff. “You work seven days a week and
days off are unheard of," she says. “If
you start to go home at night and an
animal is sick, you clock out and then
come back and work. It’s like taking care
of children. Are you going to scrimp on
the time you spend on them?"

In the end, the trio of elephants were
bought by Frank Thompson, an exotic-
animal broker for zoos and private collec-
tors. He bought them for a multimillion-
aire who loved the circus so much he
went. into the business. The elephants‘
home will be a Chicago suburb, but they
will be booked for Shrine circus acts
thrtmghaut the country.

Mr. Thompson, a former zoo director,
says that circus elephants can meet the
requirements of the endangeredspecies
act for propagation. “Elephants can
travel with the circus and reproduce and
breed. Circus elephants generally are in
better condition because they exercise,"
he says. But he admits that a lack of male
Asian elephants (who are noted for their
difﬁcult dispositions) in circuses limits
propagation of the species.

The elephants will probably be the
only animals Thompson ended up buying
at the auction. He only had “a casual
interest" in some of the pythons up for
grabs. But Thompson was disappointed
that an interview with a television re~
potter made. him miss the sale of a male
snow leopard, an endangered species. Al-
though such buying opportunities are
rare in the consumer market of exotic
animals, the leopard went for only $1 18, a

Red tides of death in Hong Kong

THOUSANDS of peasant ﬁshermen in
Hong Kong may lose their livelihoods
because of red tides of plankton that
increasingly choke the harbours around the
colony. The species of phytoplankton,
which appear in sudden waves, use so
much oxygen from the water that none is
left to support ﬁsh.

_The authorities in Hong Kong are
divided over the cause of the outbreaks.

Environmental agencies blame the increas- .

ing tide of pollution in Hong Kong’s
harbours over the past decade. Hong
Kong’s Agriculture and Fisheries Depart—
ment believes that the red tides are “purely
natural” phenomena.

Officials of the territory’s Environmental
Protection Department (EPD) draw a deﬁ-
nite link with steadily increasing pollution.
One of the worst hit areas is a ﬁngershaped
inlet called Tolo Harbour. The shores along
the lS-kilometre inlet have, over the past
decade, become dominated by industry
and by human colonisation. According to
Paul Holmes of the department’s water
policy group, the resulting increases in
pallution have raised the incidence of “red
ti es”.

One red tide this summer resulted in the
biggest loss ever recorded of commercial
ﬁsh stock in Hong Kong. lt killed 120
tonnes of ﬁsh worth £24000. A further
worry is that the inlet accommodates some
of Hong Kong’s 28 ﬁsh culture zones.

Holmes blamed the exceptional red tide
at Tolo on heavy rainfall that washed agri-
cultural wastes from the land into the
water. This compounded the effects on the
inlet of partially treated sewage from the
many new homes and buildings built on
the shores of the stretch. Together, the agri-
cultural, domestic and industrial wastes

Hong Kong Farmers,
‘ Protest. Waste Law

From Reuters

HONG KONG-More than 1,000
angry farmers, some waving empty
rice bowls, protested a new anti- *
pollution law Wednesday, saying it
would drive them out of business.

They gathered outside the legis-
lature of thisBritish colony as a bill
against dumping animal waste,
seen as a threat to their pig and
chicken farms, was passed into law.

Ng Po-wing, secretary of the
Hong Kong Assn. of Farmers
which represents . the colony’s
200,000 farmers, said the new 'law
sets stringent anti -.pollution stand-
ards and would force farmers to
install expensive waste-cleaning
systems they cannot afford. The
government had offered to buy the
farms at a price far below market

The ‘ﬁnger” oﬂ T010 traps red tides

provide a rich source of nutrients on which
the phytoplankton thrive.

Red tides are better known in the
temperate regions of the northern hemi-
sphere. They are new to the subtropical and
tropical waters of southeast Asia. Hong
Kong saw its ﬁrst red tide in the summer of
1971. The next one occurred in 1975,
followed. by six more in the 19705.

Since 1980, red tides have occurred
much more frequently. Holmes attributes
their growing magnitude and frequency to
pollution. In the ﬁrst half of this year, 16

occurred in the same waterway.

Some researchers suggest that the tides
have their origins in trace metals in the
efﬂuents discharged by chemical factories.
The metals may act as biostimulants for the
growth of plankton, they say, but research
to validate this theory has never been
carried out. However, the EPD is so
convinced that pollution is the root cause
of the plagues that it has called for legis~
lation to control water pollution. From 1
April next year, all new industrial waste
and sewage effluents will have to meet envr-
ronmental quality objectives.

The government is drawing up a waste
disposal ordinance that will operate from
June 1988. It will ban citizens of Hong
Kong in urban areas from keeping pigs and
other livestock. The objective 0 the new
restrictions is to limit the flood into the
water of nutrients on which the
phytoplankton survive.

Nonetheless, the Agriculture and Fish-
eries Department (AFD) is keen to avoid
accusations that its decision to site ﬁsh
culture zones in the inlet was misguided.

The department urges ﬁsh culturists to
avoid overstocking their cages and to aerate
the water regularly during red tides to
replenish depleted supplies of waterborne
oxygen. But few peasant farmers can afford
the electrical equipment that does this job.
“Unlike in Europe many ﬁsh farmers here
are very smallscale,” says Patsy Wong of
the AFD’s ﬁsheries research station. [:1

House Votes to Restrict
Dumping Plastic in Sea

 

By‘Tom Kenworthy
Washington Post Staff Writer

 

The House yesterday over-
whelmingly approved legislation
designed to reduce the growing en-
vironmental hazard posed by the
widespread dumping of plastic gar-
ba in oceans.

ssed 386 to 14, the measure
could lead toan outright prohibition
on the dumping of plastic by US.
vessels throughout the world and a
similar ban on dumping by all ves-
sels within 200 miles of the United
States.

Even if passed by the Senate and
signed into law by the president, it
would not go into effect until a year
after the Senate ratifies a separate
international convention regulating

Supporters of the measure hailed
it as an important first step in cure

tice of ocean dumping of plastic
products.

“It is ubiquitous, it is ugly and it
is deadly,” Studds said.

(continued)

Environmentalists estimate that
more than 1 million pounds of plas-
tic garbage are indiscriminately
dumped into the seas every year,
creating a lethal hazard for birds
and marine mammals. Plastic, prod-
ucts, many of which will not de-
grade in the ocean for hundreds of
years, are said to kill as many» as 1
million seabirds and 100,000 ma-
rine mammals a. year by clogging
their digestive tracts or by ensaring
them.

The legislation would implement
a section of the International Con-
vention for the Prevention of Pol-
lution from Ships that prohibits ves-
sels from signatory nations from
dumping plastic anywhere in the
world's oceans and from dumping
fthgr garbage within 12 miles of
an .

That international agreement
would become effective one year
after at least 25 nations represent-
ing 50 percent of \the world’s ship-
ping tonnage ratify it. The United
States accounts for about 4 percent
of world ‘ shipping tonnage, and
since nations with 46 percent of the
tonnage have signed the agree-
ment, ratification by the United
States would put it into effect. The
convention has cleared the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and is
awaiting consideration by the full
Senate. . .-

Under the terms of the legisla-
tion that passed the House, howev-
er, the U.S. Navy, which generates
a significant amount of the plastic
dumped at sea, would have up to
five years to comply. .

“This bill will eliminate or signif-
icantly reduce one of ' the major
sources of plastic pollution," said
Suzanne ludicello, coauthor of a
study of the issue conducted. by the
Center for Environmental Educa-
tion. “Flagrant violators will prob-
ably be prosecuted."

The legislation would direct the
Department of TranspOrtation to

ensure that the nation's ports and
shipping terminals have adequate

facilities for collectingvplastic gar-
bage and would require ships to

maintain records of their refuse ,

Violations of the act would, be

punishable by fines ' of up " to
$25,000.

The bill also would require the

to study ways to keep plastic mass.

terials from entering the oceans

from land-based sources, including
the feasibility of banning. the pro-
duction of some products. . '

FROM OUR DUBLIN CORRESPONDENT

OME of the 42,000 foreign anglers

visiting Ireland’s ﬁsheries this season
have witnessed a phenomenon that the
Irish tourist board prays will never re—
peat itself: record numbers of ﬁsh dying
because of water pollution. On the
salmonvrich Barrow river, 20,000 fish
died along a distance of 30 miles. It was
the largest of 1 18 such incidents this year
(well over double the annual average
since 1980). This is an embarrassing
score for a country that advertises itself
as clean and green.

Most of these ﬁsh’kills have been
caused by farmers dumping pig and cat—
tle slurry into rivers, or allowing silage ef—
ﬂuent to seep into the water system.
Farmers’ organisations put the water
poisonings down to a small minority of
negligent farmers or to accidental
spillages. But as one pollution expert
says, “Irish farmers think of rivers pri—
marily as drains.”

Local authorities think of rivers as
drains, too. Although Ireland has spent
lREéOOm ($890m) on water—treatment

plants since 1980, some local authorities

. do not yet bother with water treatment '

at all. Dun Laoghaire, a suburb of Dub;
lin with a population of 55,000, dumps
its raw sewage straight into Dublin Bay.
Stand back, Dublin Bay prawns.

Every region has been affected by pole
luted water and fish—kills. Worst hit are
waters such as Lough Sheelin, around
which intensive pig farming produces
62m gallons of slurry a year. Athlone, on
the banks of the Shannon, has been re—

Paddling against pollution

moved from the tourist board’s promo,
tions because muck from the town dump
keeps washing into the river. Chemical
dumping caused the river Blackwater in
County Cork to suffer a fish—kill during a
visit last month by French, British and
Dutch anglers: 500 salmon went belly—
up. An inspection along the river Boyne
found that four salmon—spawning tribu—
taries contained no fish at all.

Last year 6,000 pollution cases were
investigated by the ﬁsheries board and
local authorities. Only 2% of those
reached court, in most cases the district
court, where the maximum fine is
IREZSO (though one man convicted of
causing pollution has been sentenced to
18 months’ imprisonment—but he was
dumping large quantities of animal
blood in a river). Traditionally, a word in
the appropriate ear has been preferred
to prosecution. '

The government’s response to the
rise in incidents of pollution has been to
appoint a cabinetvlevel committee to
look into it. Critics say that adequate
laws are on the books, if only the govern—
ment would spend enough on investiga—
tion and prosecution. But the ofﬁcial
environmental protection agency has
been disbanded to save money, and re
cent spending cuts mean that enforce—
ment of anti—pollution laws, always lax,
will become more so. Fishery inspectors
have been told there is no more money
this year to put petrol in their cars or
outboard motors. They have been issued
with paddles.

Pollution ClOses In on Gulf of Maine

 

Special to The New York Times

PORTLAND, Me., Sept. 25 — Pollu-
tion problems that have plagued the At-
lantic seaboard this summer are now
believed to pose a threat to the rich
fishing habitat off the coast of Maine,
an area once thought to be untroubled
by pollution.

Scientists, concerned by the recent
discovery of hazardous substances in
the area, are calling for extensive re-
search into the unknown sources of pol-
lutants to save the coast from further
destruction.

Recent studies have found PCB’s,
heavy metals, hydrocarbons and ex-
cess nitrogen from sewage on the 4,500-
mile coastline from Cape Cod to the
Bay of Fundy. .

Scientists say that so far, the pollu-
tion has not caused nearly as much
harm to the Gulf of Maine as it has in

 

An area thought
to be pristine is
now threatened.

mers were driven from beaches this
summer by fecal bacteria.

But Senator George J. Mitchell,
Democrat of Maine, said the pollution
pointed to “long-term risks” that war-
ranted a comprehensive study of the
gulf, whose oceanography has never
been fully understood.

Mr. Mitchell, chairman of the Senate
subcommittee on environmental pro-
tection, is drafting legislation asking
for Federal funds forthe research.

“If we do nothing, in 50 years it’ll
look like New York bight,” said Dr.

ences in West Boothbay Harbor.

Dr. Yentsch is a member of the As-
sociation for Research on the Gulf of
Maine, or ARGO, a consortium of ma—
rine researchers and educators urging
more study.

Unacceptable Levels of DDT

PCB’s, polychlorinated biphenyls, a
cancer-causing compound once used in

all 94 samples taken at 19 sites in a
study conducted by Anne Johnson, di-
rector of marine programs for the
Maine Audubon Society.

The outlawed insecticide DDT and
hydrocarbons from oil burning are
“well above acceptable levels,” ac-
cording to Charles N. Ehler, director of
the Federal Office of Oceanography
and Marine Assessment.

Sewer discharge is blamed for con-
tributing to the algal bloom that closed
13,000 acres, or 26 percent, of the
state’s clam flats, and a study this year
by the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Adminstration found that fish in
Casco Bay had the highest concentra-
tion of lead in their fish livers in the
country.

Plastic olﬁcts in Casco Bay have
also emerged as a serious threat to
birds and fish. The creatures become
entagled in plastic fishing lines, and
some have starved to death after plas-
tic bottles or bags lodged in their diges-
tive tracts. .

Plankton, Turbulence and Sun

ics make it one of the richest marine
habitats in the world, scientists say.

“It is actually a shallow sea amaz-
ingly rich in planktonic growth,” said
Dr. Yentsch. The plankton feed an
abundance of haddock, cod, sole, her-
ring, mackerel, shellfish and lobsters. }
Last year Maine fishermen took 166
million pounds of fish, worth an esti-
mated $108 million, from gulf waters.

The crashing of tidal waves from the
Bay of Fundy, some reaching heights
of 40 feet, and the influx of fresh water
,lfrom the mouths of Maine’s major
rivers create unusual turbulence that
lifts the nutrients to the surface where

 

sunlight allows marine life to flourish, .

Dr. Yentsch said.

But algae and other microorganisms
are now thriving, feeding on phos-
phates and inorganic nitrogen from
treated fecal matter in discharged
wastewater.

Primitive Sewage Treatment
The teeming microorganisms in-

electrical conductivity, were found in .

The Gulf of Maine’s unusual dynam- ,

systems. Only in June, when legislators
noticed a growing trend in licensed sys-
tems consisting of only a relatively
ineffective “sand filter,” many for
vacation cottages along lakes and the
coast, was a law enacted requiring
hook-ups to private or municipal sys-
tems.

Bangor and Brunswick, two of the
state’s larger cities, do not yet have
sewage treatment plants capable of
removing viruses and bacteria as re—
quired by Federal law, though they are
planned, said Dean Marriott, Commis-
sioner of the state Department of Envi-
ron mental Protection.

And even treated sewage usually ‘re-
tains some of the inorganic substances
that encourage algae growth. ‘

The source of PCB’s is not as readily
detectable, said Ms. Johnson of the
Audubon society. Possibly, she said,
they may come from dumps. When
burned, PCB’s from transformers and
other devices are released and carried
in the air.

PCB’s lodge in sediment on the ocean
floor. They pose a danger to hake, cod
and bottomodwelling marine life, as
well as to the people who eat them.

4 Senators Seeking
A Study ofDumping
Off New York Coas't

 

WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 (AP) —— The
four Senators from New Jersey and
New York have introduced legislation
calling for a study of the garbage
dumping that is suspected of polluting
the coastal waters of both states.

The Federal study would look at
spurces of dumping in the so-called
New York bight, the bay and ocean
.waters at the mouth of New York Har-
bor. .

Garbage dumped, from boats and
barges in the area is suspected as a
chief cause of pollution along New Jer-
sey beaches this summer.

The bill was introduced this week by
Senators Bill Bradley and Frank R.
Lautenberg, Democrats of New Jersey,
and the New York Senators Daniel Pat-
rick Moynihan, a Democrat, and Al-
fonse M. D’Amato, a Republican.

 

clude the algae form believed to cause
“red tide,” which has spoiled clam
flats in the gulf. In excessive numbers,
the microorganisms also deplete oxy-
gen from the water, killing some fish
and forcing others to flee. A report
issued by the Office of Technology As-
sessment shows a 15 percent increase 1
in areas along the coast that are oxy~
gen-poor. ‘
In Maine, the algae problem stems
primarily from increased population,
especially in the south, along with farm
‘ fertilizer runoff and outmoded sewage

Sludge Dump Site Closing

The bill calls on the Federal Environ-
mental Protection Agency to deter-
mine the kind of trash being dumped in
the bight and to seek alternative means
of disposal.

The measure would also require the
agency to set standards for some of the
more toxic materials known to be
dumped in the area, such as cancer-
causing polychlorinated biphenyls, or
PCB’s.

The Senators said the closing of a
sludge dump site 12 miles off the coast
of New Jersey, scheduled for the end of
the year, would improve water quality.

But the lawmakers said other dump-

‘ “bring a lot of pressure, including law-
‘ suits,” against polluters.

FISHERMEN’S GROUP
r0 {retirement

A Privately Financed ‘Keeper’
Is to Pressure Polluters

NEW LONDON, Conn, Oct. 10 (AP)
-— A fishermen’s group is hiring an in-
dependent “sound keeper” to watch
over Connecticut’s coastal waters and

The privately financed position will
have “no political ties and can work un-
hindered,” said Terry Backer, presi-
dent of the Connecticut Coastal Fisher—
men's Association. “When you don’t
put chains on the organization, it can go
after anyone.”

“We intend to bring a lot of pressure,
including lawsuits if we have to, on pol-
luters,” said Mr. Backer, one of several
candidates for the job.

Once the position is filled within
about two months, the keeper will di—
vide his time equally between western
and eastern portions of Long Island
Sound.

-

A $172,500 Settlement

Without vigilance, the waters off
southeastern Connecticut could be-
come seriously polluted as well, Mr.
Backer said.

Seed money for the post came from a
$172,500 settlement the association won
from the City of Norwalk in a suit over
Norwalk's pollution of a tributary of
the Norwalk River.

Half the money was used for cleanup
efforts in Norwalk Harbor, Mr. Backer
said. The balance will start the pro-
gram. Additional funds have been

‘ pledged by environmental foundations
and individuals.

A full-time keeper will be able to
track down small and large sources of
pollution, and will also take an active
part in hearings on any applications for
dredging and filling permits.

Reviewing the Rights of Mariners

Those activities are eating away at
Connecticut’s salt marshes, which pro-
vide food and shelter for many shell-
fish and fish species, Mr. Backer said.

“The sound is dying the death of a
thousand cuts,” Mr. Backer said. None
of the dredging or filling activities are
large enough to have a major impact

“We need EPA. to take a broad look

Similiar legislation was suggested in
the House earlier this week by Repre-
sentatives William J. Hughes and

DON’T in our 0cm: '
rum mm srwrns

For years, industrial, urban, and agricultural wastes ’

 

 

have been sluicing into our coastal waters, but Ameri-

cans gave little thought to the effects on marine or
human life. Yet this summer the dolphins came home to
roost—washed up dead on beaches from New Jersey to
Virginia. They were but one warning that something is
terribly amiss with the coastal ecosystem. Swimming at
New Jersey shores was banned brieﬂy bedause of polluted
water. Fishermen on Chesapeake Bay bemoaned the skimpy
oyster harvest. In Washington State, folks wondered how to
clean up the results of years of industrial dumping that has
turned parts of Puget Sound into a hazardous waste site.

The U. S. has done a good, though unfinished, job of
ridding its air of pollution and cleaning up its rivers,
streams, and lakes. But the coastal waters, breeding ground
for all types of marine life, have largely been neglected in
the cleanup effort The result? Ever-increasing incidents of
beach closures, ﬁsh kills, and hepatitis from eating contami-
nated shellﬁsh. And the problem is destined to get worse:
Three out of every four Americans are expected to live
within 50 mi. of the sea by the year 1990.

Faced with this emergency, Congress needs to draw up a
comprehensive plan to deal with coastal pollution. More mon-
ey must be made available to upgrade sewage-treatment
plants, especially in big cities. That would improve the quali-
ty of sewage wastes that ﬂow into coastal waters. Residents
would have to pay more for their water—but the cost of
doing nothing will be higher.

Industry, too, will have to continue to modify its manufac'
turing practices so that fewer wastes are generated to begin
with. And developers will have to pull back from the shore.
Farmers, who already are producing more crops than are
needed, could voluntarily cut back acreage along river banks
to slow the movement of fertilizer residues to the water.
And urban residents need to take more care about what type
of wastes they leave on city streets.

If steps are not taken soon, a trip to the beach in the
future could become a visit to the graveyard.

The poisoned seas

If you pause in your stroll
along the beach and lift a shell to
your ear, you can hear the ocean
crying for help. There is a puz-
zled tone to the cry, suggesting
that (the ocean cannot under-
stand why mankind, which
draws so many blessings from it,
should be willing to pollute it to
death. ‘

We can only guess that, the
impressive size of the ocean

_ encourages the false notion that

it is big enough to handle any-
thing we throw at it. We have
thrown a great deal -- getting
away with it when coastal popu-
lations were much smaller than
they are today, and when manu-
facturing processes were much
less likely to produce toxic by-
products. We pose a much great-
er menace today.

To be/sure, a new awareness
has applied the brakes to some
extent. There are laws in a
number of major industrial
countries designed to moderate
the speed at which" we poison
rivers, lakes and oceans, but we
can hardly claim success. The

cumulative effect of our slovenly

ways is still there -- and, to our
shame, there is evidence of a
lingering belief that the ocean
will absorb and forgive endless-
ly. -
If dolphins could give their
own comprehensive account, we
might better understand why 250
of them washed up on the east
coast of the United States, from
Virginia to New Jersey. We do
know that something interfered
with the immune system which
would normally enable them to
deal with bacteria, and they
succumbed. Pollution is a prime
suspect -—- as it is in the case of
vast quantities of fish whose
bodies appeared on the shores of
Long Island ‘ Sound in early
August. New York City and six

‘ satellite communities have the

dubious distinction of being the
only communities in the United
States that persist in- dumping
sewage sludge at Sea.

Humans have not similarly
fallen victim to the fouling of
coastal waters -- but perhaps

The Delaware River Association is

only because they are in a posi-
tion to organize swimming bans
when the pollution drifts their
way. (The defensive manoeuvre
is well known in various cities
and towns around the Great
Lakes.)

Canada is entitled to no supe-

rior position in these matters.
The traditional method of deal-
ing with city waste — piping it
unceremoniously into the near-
est waterway -— prevails. Last
summer, federal Environment
Minister Thomas McMillan. de-.
scribed the saltwater harbor
that separates Halifax from
Dartmouth in simple terms: “An
open sewer.” Canada’s munici-
pal. sewage systems were in
scandalous shape, he said, add-
ing that it would take $44«billion
over the next 10 years to bring
emissions down to acceptable
levels.
' Montreal, tiring at last of its
ignoble reputation as a major
producer of raw sewage for the
St. Lawrence River, has em-
barked on a $1.5-biilion program
of sewage works — a plan of
considerable interest to down-
stream communities.

Now and then there are en-
couraging stories of ill-treated,
waters'fighting their way back
to recovery. The Mediterranean,
though by no means out of trou.
ble, is pulling back from the
brink of death by pollution
through a l7-nation campaign to
clean it up. The United States
and its Caribbean neighbors are
collaborating on a similar plan

' Experts Fear Oil Spill in the Gulf Tanker War

 

By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

As the attacks on oil tankers in the
Persian Gulf have resumed, biologists
say a major oil spill there resulting
from the rupturing of a large tanker
could cause immense damage to wild-
life and to the economy of the region.

In particular, the experts say, a large
spill could foul the cooling water in-
takes of desalinization plants along the
gulf coast. That would reduce drinking
water supplies as well as the water es-
sential to many industrial processes.
All of the nations along the western
shore of the gulf get most of their
-* drinking water from desalinization

Richard Golob of Cambridge, Mass,
editor of the Oil Spill Intelligence Re-
port, .said the Joss . of __ desalinization
plants would have dangerous economic
effects on Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi-Arabia,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and
possibly on Iran.

Another expert, John Robinson of the
Hazardous Materials Response Branch
of the National Oceanic and Atmos-
pheric Administration, agreed there
could be severe effects, from a large
spill in the Persian Gulf. But he said the
effects of oil pollution depended on
many factors and were hard to predict.

“If the gulf war should result in a

 

would certainly be concerned about the
possibility of damage to the desaliniza-
tion plants.

“Of course, there have been some big
spills in the gulf before, which did not
cause anywhere near the damage that
some people had anticipated. Much ,de-
pends on water currents, tides, wind di-
rection, weather and other factors that
make predictions difficult.”

One reason the gulf is particularly
vulnerable to oil spills, Mr. Golob said,
is the shallowness of the water and the
gentle slope of its bottom. The average
depth of the gulf, he said, is 115 feet,
and in the western part of its seabed,

 

Fireﬁghters ﬂushd pollution into the Rhine

nitrate by half. The acidity of the water,
however, by which the German ministry
measures the Rhine’s biological ill health,
- has increased over the same period by 37
per cent.

The Rhine commission will coordinate
the plan, but its member States, Switzer-
land, West Germany, France, Holland and
Luxembourg, will do the cleaning up. Their
ﬁrst job, a “priority list” of pollutants, will
be based on similar national lists. Goppel

says that it will focus on halogenated hydro- talists as upholding the agency’s .au-

carbons, heavy metals and nutrients, such

as phosphates, that cause biological imbal- tion of the 1972 Clean Water Act.~

ances in the river.

In the next year, says Goppel, national hampton, N.Y., was the. first court deci-
authonttes w111 determine the sources of sion settling a challenge to the environ- ..

these pollutants. The problem, says
Goppel, will be deciding how much comes
from factories and how much comes from
“diffuse” sources such as municipal waste
and agriculture.

Even the initial inventory of sources of
pollution, on which much of the plan
depends, relies on the willingness of
governments to release data on industries.
France has been the most forthcoming
government, say observers, because admis-

sions about pollution create little outcry‘

among the French. By contrast, public
concern about the health of the Rhine is
very high in Switzerland and West
Germany. Observers say that this leads to
great governmental reluctance to release
ﬁgures on the subject. [3

E.P.A. Upheldin BlOcking Mall on wetlands

 

 

,.By ELIZABETH NEUFFER |

A Federal judge has upheld the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s author—
ity to override the Army Corps of Engi-
neers and block a shopping mall from
being built .on a Massachusetts wet-
land. "

The ruling Tuesday, in a case
brought by the developer of a mall pro.-
posed for Sweeden’s Swamp in Attle-
boro, Mass, was hailed by environmen-

thority to protect wetlands under a sec-

The decision, handed down in Bing-

mental agency in Bos’ton.w“‘lin—general

, terms, it upholds E.P.A. statutory au-

thority to protect Wetlands throughout
the country.” . .

Efforts to reach Gary H. liaise, the

lawyer for Pyramid Companies, the
developer that filed the suit against the
environmental agency, were unsuc-
cessful.

Sarah Compton, a lawyerrepresent:
ing the National Chamber of Com-
merce, which intervened in the suit in
behalf of Pyramid, said she could not
comment on the final decision. She said
the Chamber of Commerce believed
that environmental agency had Cgene

 

mental agency’s authority under sec--
tion 404 of the Federal law, which gov-i
erns wetlands, environmentalists said.
But whether the decision has wider,
implications for the environmental
agency’s enforcement of the Clean l
Water Act is still unclear, said both en- ?
vironmentalists and Federal officials,
who had yet to see the decision by Fed-
eral District Judge Thomas J. McAvoy.

. ‘Uphold E.P.A. Authority’

“1 would expect that it would set a
precedent that EPA. does have the
right, as we believe we do, to protect
wetlands,” said Michael R. Deland, re-
gional administratorfor the environ-

beyond its statutory authority. N 7

Judge McAvoy’s law clerk, Mary
Ellen O’Leary, said the judge’s deci-
sion held that the environmental
agency was in compliance with section
404 of the Clean Water Act in denying
the permi . The decision also rules that
the deve oper did not fully explore
other practicable alternatives, she
said. . .

The decision is the'latest step in a
four—year battle over the 50-acre red-
maple Sweeden’s Swamp, which had

, been purchased by Pyramid Compa-
" nies as the site for a shopping mall. The
company, which applied for a permit to .

build on the swamp, was initially
denied a permit by the Army Corps of
Engineers.

Under the Clean _Water' Act, the I

\

Corps of Engineers has responsibility
to grant or“ deny permits to dredge or '

fill..wetlands. and the environmental
agency has the responsiblity to reviewI
the permits to determine if they would
adversely affect the environment.

Reversal by Army Engineers

In 1985, however, the Army Corps of
Engineers reversed its decision and
recommended that a permit be
granted for construction on the swamp.
The Environmental Protection Agency
then reviewed that decision and in 1986
determined that a permit should not be
granted.

 

Lawyers for Pyramid then chal-
lenged the EPA. decision, saying
there were no alternative sites for their
proposed shopping malls.

The ensuing debate over the case at-
tracted national concern. In May, 1986,

 

a bipartisan group of 12 United States
Senators charged that construction on
thgswgmpwould set avprecedent, mak-
ing‘ all such ecologically valuable wet-
lands vulnerable to development. Some
members of Congress also charged
that the Corps of Engineers was trying
to change basic environmental policy

 

concerning wetlands.

 

"This mezms.“ he said, “that, most of
the energy of waves approaching the
shore is absorbed by the sand flats”
Less wave energy is therefore avail-j
able for breaking up an oil spill. A spill i
thus threatens sea grass and coral, the
nurseries of the marine ecosystem.”

Also, the circulation of water be-
tween the Persian Gulf and the Ara-
bian Sea is restricted by the narrow
Strait of Hormuz, and this tends to hold
pollution in the gulf. In places, the gulf
is only about 50 miles wide, and an ex-
tensive oil slick would be almost cer-
tain to contaminate part of the 1,200
miles of unbroken beach where the re-
gion’s deserts meet the water.

A large oil spill might reduce catches
of commercial fish and shrimp by Ku—
wait. and other coastal states, Mr.
Golob said. It would also threaten
manatees, whales, dolphins and other

aﬁuatic animals and birds. .
When such spills occur, the experts

said, real environmental damage
sometimes falls well short of pessimis-
tic predictions. '

“The Iraqi attack on Iran’s Kharg Is-
land refinery in April 1984 was ex-
pected to cause massive damage,”-Mr.
Robinson said. “In fact, although some
2.5 million gallons were spilled, the de-
struction of habitat and damage to
desalinization plants was much less
than feared.” ‘
Mr. Robinson said satellite photogra-
phy of the gulf had found that shifting
currents and tidal cycles had profound
effectson the damage from an oil spill.
“For example,” he said, “the intakes
of the desalinization plants are below
the surface of the water. If the water is

calm during an oil spill, oil on the sur-

face may not be sucked in. A storm,

however, causes mixing and a dras

cally different outcome.”

“One factor that may be working
favor of Persian Gulf wildlife is acc
matization,” Mr. Robinson said. “Cre
tures living in the gulf are exposed
nearly continuous spills of oil, indt

trial Waste and desert sand. To sor

extent, they’ve learned to handle su
things.” ,

At the same time, Mr. Golob sa
catastrophe is almost inevitable if t
so-called tanker war continues.“

“It’s just a matter of time before
missile or shell breaks open a:
empties one or two cargo compa:
ments of a large tanker,” he sa-
“This could release a spill larger th;
any in American history.”

He added that if gulf countries fao
a lack of drinking water, the charact
of the war could radically change.

Ministers back plan
to purge the Rhine

THE ENVIRONMENT ministers of the
countries that border the Rhine have
agreed on an “action plan” to clean up
Western Europe’s dirtiest river. The mini-
sters have pledged to make the Rhine clean
enough for humans to drink from, and for
salmon to live in, by the year 2000.

In the ﬁrst phase of the plan, they will set
priorities for the reduction of major pollu-
tants, and analyse the costs of various anti-
pollution measures. They aim by 1995, the
end of the second phase, to have halved
discharges of the worst pollutants, and to
have enforced technical safeguards against
the accidental release of contaminants. In
the third phase, these measures, plus
improved hydrological management of the ‘
river, are expected to result in a clean Rhine
by the year 2000. ‘ ,

The agreement comes in the wake of the
ﬁrst major settlement for damages arising .
from last November’s ﬁre in a chemicals
warehouse in Switzerland. Water used by
ﬁreﬁghters to extinguish the blaze washed
thousands of tonnes of toxic organic
compounds and mercury into the Rhine.

Sandoz, the Swiss company that owned
the warehouse, has agreed to pay the
French government £4-6 million, mostly to
compensate ﬁshing interests, and to
improve the warning system for spills. West
Germany and Holland still demand
settlements.

The French claim was reduced from an
original demand for £25 million, because
damage expected from the pollution failed
to materialise. Michel Goppel, head of the
Intemation Commission for the Protection
of the Rhine, says that dire predictions of a
“dead river” made after the pollution inci-
dent were “too pessimistic. The Rhine has
practically recovered”.

Apart from eels, which could take
another eight years to reach their former
numbers, ﬁsh and microorganisms
“survived fairly well”, says Goppel. This
was largely because eggs and larvae resisted
the pollutants better than the adult
organisms. Meanwhile, residual pollution
of sediments in the river is “almost at back-
ground level”, says Goppel.

The background level of pollution in the
Rhine is the most worrying aspect. The
West German environment ministry says
that concentrations of pollutants in the
Rhine have fallen over the past 10 years.
Levels of mercury have fallen by three-
quarters, and phosphorus and ammonium

The Waters, Befouled, ‘Cry Out for

By ROBERTO SURO

Special to The New York Times

SOTTOMARINA, Italy —- All sum-
mer long this year the Adriatic was
hot and languid and getting sicker by
the day. Eventually, one little part of
the sea almost died when pollutants
dumped by the Po River helped kill
nearly all the fish in an area of nearly
400 square miles

When the seasons changed, the sea
began healing itself. Autumn winds
and waves brought cleaner water and
carried off the pesticides and human
wastes. Although the emergency has
now passed, this autumn remains
especially important to the health of
the Adriatic because the Italian Gov-
ernment is deciding whether or not to
contribute to the cure.

The Adriatic has suffered fish kills
before when pollution and unusual
amounts of sunlight induce vast
growths of algae that robs the water
of oxygen as it rots. But this year
there was an exceptional public reac-
tion. For the first time the coast’s
politically powerful tourism and fish-
ing industries are demanding Gov-

ernment action to halt pollution that

rivers carry down to the sea from ~

cities, farms and factories inland.

Some environmentalists hope this
will prove a decisive change. Others
fear it is simply another episode of
temporary concern that will pass
with the season.

“If the rivers, especially the P0, are
not cleaned up,” said Valentino Fos-
sato of the Institute for Marine Biol-
ogy in Venice, “there will be a popu-
lar insurrection on the coast by peo-
ple who see their livelihoods and their

health threatened. That will eventu-_

ally force the politicians to act, but
what we have now are only the first
signs of protest after a long period of
finding easy solutions.”

A Change in Words

Decades of compromises along
Italy’s northern Adriatic coast have
allowed tall stands of high-rise beach
hotels and prosperous fishing ports to
coexist with some of the most pol-
luted water in Europe. Mr. Fossato,
who heads the institute’s environ-
mental biochemistry department,
notes that the coastal population usu-
ally has been as complacent about
pollution as Milan’s 1.5 million inhab-

itants, whose raw sewage pours into

tributaries of the Po.

Here in Sottomarina, a resort 33
miles from Venice, a pollution prob-
lem that closed beaches a few years
ago was dealt with by creating a dike
in summertime so that the befouled
waters of the Brenta River simply
flow offshore instead of onto the
beach. Elsewhere, Mr. Fossato said,
local authorities have often raised the
permissible levels of pollution when
water samplesshowed that profit-
ably crowded beaches were becom-
ing unsanitary.

But a clear change in words, and
perhaps in attitude, was evident when
Environment Minister Giorgio Ruf-
folo met recently with officials from
the area worst hit by the end-of—sum-
mer fish kill, the coast just south of
the Po river delta. He said angrily
that both the river and the sea “cry
out for vengeance.”

Mayors of coastal towns rose one
after another to describe breeding

grounds for mussels and clams that -

had been poisoned, beaches that had
to be cleared of refuse with bulldoz-
ers and hordes of tourists who fled
when dead cows, washed down the
Po, were spotted floating in the sea.

According to Massimo Serafini, an j

environmentalist elected to Parlia—
ment on the Communist ticket, the
mayors’
“signs of important political
change.” Never before, he said, “has
a broad public opinion movement
formed in the Adriatic communities
to confront an ecological emergency
and to demand long-term action from
the national government.”

In Rome. a politically diverse
group of legislators from the stricken

region is demanding special attention -

for the Adriatic as the Government
considers a three-year, $10 billion na-
tional cleanup program.

The Mississippi of Italy

The cleanup task is substantial con-
sidering that Italy’s waste treatment
plants can handle only 45 precent of
the dirty water produced by cities
and factories, compared to the 75 to
90 percent capacity com mon-in north-
ern Europe. Moreover, only about
half the Italian plants function at any
one time, according to the Environ-
ment Ministry. In several cases no
sewer systems were built to connect
the plants to the sources of pollution.

The Po is Italy’s Ganges, its Missis-
sippi, an artery that is part of the na-
tional identity, and one of Italy’s
great contributions to the crossword
puzzle. According to Paolo Zatta of
the National Research Council, it is
also the heart of Italy’s water pollu-
tionproblem. In his laboratory in
Padua, Mr. Zatta, a biochemist, pours
over computer. printouts showing
analyses of 4,000 water samples he
helped take from the Po this summer.

“It is hard to imagine how a river
can get much more polluted than this
one is already,” he said, pointing to
estimates that at least 650 tons of ar-
senic, 60,000 tons of nitrates and
13,000 tons of ammonia products are

dumped into the river each_year.

‘Ever More Complex Problem’

Starting not far from the French
border, the Po runs aross the broad

plain that is the heartland of northern

Italy. Nearly a third of the nation’s
population lives in the Po basin,
producing about 40 percent of Italy’s
industrial output. In between are

large farming areas so heavily de-

pendent on the use of chemicals that

Italy consumes one-tenth of all the

pesticides used in the world, five
times as much as the European aver-
age, according to Government stud-
ies.

cals, Mr Zatta said, “the Po presents
an ever more complex and dangerous
pollution problem.” Many Italian

cities draw their drinking water f rom‘

the Po, and Mr. Zatta believes that
fish kills in the Adriatic will take *‘a

low priority if the level of carcinogens
and other dangerous subtances conﬁ

tinues to rise in urban reservoirs. «1 '

protests and others are .

Especially in terms of toxic chem1—;

The environment’s growing polititj‘
cal constituency in Italy was evident'
when members of the Green party"
were elected to Parliament for the
first time last June, and some major
parties, most notably the Commu-"
nists, felt obliged to promote environﬁ
mentalist candidates. But this coi'i—
stituency remains highly fragment-j;
ed, reflecting the overall political
scene

Currently. responsibility for the P0

is divided among dozens of regional;

provincial and local governments,
and no one seriously argues with M1.
Ruffolo when he proposes a coordi-
nated effort, a goal he calls “very. dif-
ficult but not impossible to achieve.”
Many, like M1. Zatta, are not opti- ,
mistic. “Other countries, like Great;
Britain, have cleaned up dirty rivers,;
but they carried out nationwide plans
for 10 or 20 years,” he said. “Italy,
does not solve p1 oblems that way be-,
cause this is a country of tempests,

and this tempest will pass soon and _

then come back only when the algae.
starts growing again next summer.”

By JOHN TAGLIABUE
Special to The New York Times

CRACOW, Poland — Across Eastern
Europe, a crisis of the environment is
eroding the natural and cultural herit-
age, confronting Communist govern-
ments with major pollution problems
at a time when economic difficulties
are diminishing the financial resources
to deal with them.

In East German cities like Leipzig
and Dresden, buildings spared the rav-
ages of World War II are now subject
to the gnawing of polluted air.

In the panhandle where East Germa-
ny, Czechoslovakia and Poland meet,

power generation, the level of water,
soil and plant contamination has
reached troubling proportions, accord-
ing to a study by the Wroclaw College
of Science and Technology, in Poland.

, Major rivers like the Oder, which di-
vides Poland from East Germany, and
the Vistula, central Poland’s largest
waterway, are clogged with industrial
waste and sewage — the spinoff of
rapid postwar industrialization and
population growth.

Industry’s “Negative Side’

The developing environmental crisis
is causing governments all over East-
ern Europe for the first time to con-
sider scaling back local industries, like
steel and chemicals, in certain areas in
light of their damaging environmental

Freedom and Peace, a loosely organ-
ized Polish opposition group that began
with the issue of conscientious objec-
tion to military duty, includes environ-
mental activity in its program.

A few weeks ago four members of

the group clambered over scaffolding!
on a downtown building where traces of l
environmental damage were being re-l
moved, in a brief demonstration that
included appeals for pollution control.

Long before such demonstrations}
*however, moonlighting ecologists and}
‘ local scientists banded together. in the

Polish Ecological Club, a Government-
endorsed organization that has since
spread its activities across Poland to
raise public consciousness about the
environmental problem.

Communist governments throughout
' the Eastern bloc seek to channel such

activity. In September, Cracow "was the
scene of a meeting of similar groups
from East Germany, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and the Soviet Union. The

 

 

gathering was dubbed Greenway, a

name probably meant to evoke the
Greenpeace movement, whose outspo
kenness is frowned upon in Easter

Europe. 1
, But the limits on such government-
; approved activity are strict, as govern

ments seek to keep the movement from

 

sources: industrial production and
power generation.”

He added: “We know that the tech--
nology of our industrial plant and
power industries is not the most mod-
ern. For example, in the energy plants
. there are no sulfur filters, though they:
' are all coal burning.”

The radioactive clOud from the Cher-

inobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet

, Union 18 months ago, which forced gov-
ernments to take emergency public
health measures, was one pollution
development that shook the people of
Eastern Europe. .

After the explosion and fire at the
reactor, some East-bloc countries al-
lowed their state-controlled press to re-
port aggressively on pollution. In Po-
land, the Council of State set up an en-
viron mental protection commission.

In cities like Cracow, though, it didn’t
take Chernobyl to let people know
something was wrong.

High salinity in the Vistula from in-

Pollution is widespread in many
Western nations as well, but experts
,consider the crisis more severe and
further along in Eastern Europe. For
one thing, Eastern European industry
is more heavily concentrated in small
areas than in Western Europe or the
United States. Also, lack of money and
the fact that industrial management
and environmental control are in the
hands of the same leaders has tended
to slow cleanup efforts.

Cows Unable to Stand

The leaders of the Cracow club like
to boast .of its role in bringing about the
closing in 1981 of the electrolysis line at
a local aluminum plant, after large
fluoride concentrations were discov-
ered in surrounding fields.

But others say the closing was un-
avoidable after the fluoride produced
serious signs of bone damage in cows-
that grazed the fields, making them un-
able to stand.

More recently, the club’s activities
have been reduced to those of a discus-
sion circle.

The New York Times/Oct.25,1987
Crumbling stonework in Cracow
is one sign of the pollution prob-
lem gripping Eastern Europe.

 

Steel mills lack
filters, and
statues lack faces.

 

Cracow is in a particularly difficult
situation because much of the pollution
stems from the region’s power plants
and blast furnaces at steel mills, where
measures to cut pollution advance at al
snail’s pace for lack of money. ‘

Many local industries, notably steel,
have become uneconomical, and de-
mands for quick investment in pollu-
tion-control devices like filters further
threaten their financial base. The Gov-
ernment recently introduced a far-
reaching program of economic change,
but few economists believe the pro-
gram will have any immediate effect
on the level of local pollution.

In the late 1940’s, Poland’s Commu-
nist authorities, in a curious case of in-
dustrial irony, chose Cracow —- a city
of middle-class values and intellectual
bent, clustered around the revered Ja-
giellonian University -— as the site of
anexperiment in social engineering.

On fertile fields north of the city they,
stamped out an immense, integrated
steel mill, with a model city called
Nowa Huta to house the families of tens‘.
of thousands of steelworkers. The
mills, named for Lenin, were to be a‘
demonstration of the dynamism of the’
new Communist Poland. i,

Now 32,000 steelworkers turn out;
about 5.5 million tons of steel a year at
the mills, compared with a peak pro-F
duction of 7.7 million tons in 1979. The
plants are a kind of industrial white
elephant, a monument to an idea gone
wrong, and pollution is a growing cause
of antagonism between Cracow and the
mills’ managers.

Health Risks Ignored; Thousands Poisoned

Poor Nations Pour On Pesticides

By MORT ROSENBLUM, Associated Press

AIROBI, Kenya—The world’s
poorer countries, desperate for

. more crops, are spraying pesticides
at dangerous new levels, killing people by
the tens of thousands and poisoning envi-
ronments.

3 Despite new international guidelines,
pesticides outlawed in the United States
and Europe are sold aggressively through-
out the Third World to farmers untrained
in their use.

“It is going to get worse,” said Thomas
Odhiambo, . director of the International
Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology in
Nairobi. “Unless we develop a strategy,
this will be with us forever.”

Stimulatingvl’ests

Odhiambo, chairman of the African
Academy of~ Sciences, and other specialists,
farmers and officials in developed and
developing ebuntries say:

oMisused poisons are stimulating pests
they are meant to kill, creating resistances

and new threats that spur an even greater
use of more potent chemicals.

 

 

Unprotected farm workers in Kenya spray pesticide onto
millet. At right, woman fills water cans in front of Union

oHarmful effects reach consumers in
developed countries, widening What U.S.
researcher David Weir identified as “a
circle of poison.”

eThe spreading ecological damage is
worldwide, with traces of banned chemi-
cals in Antarctic snowfields and Alpine
lakes. Some soils are losing productivity
and ground water is increasingly polluted.

7 oOveruse of DDT, malathion and other
pesticides are rendering malarial mosqui-
toes invulnerable in some tropical climates.

r oAlthough world attention focused on
2,347 Indians killed in 1984 at Union
Carbide’s plant in Bhopal, many thousands
more die unnoticed at backyard factories
all over the Third World.

“The argument is that pesticides are
essential to protect food supplies,” said
David Bull, a British specialist. “But we are
creating even greater problems for the
future.”

Major producers now sell $18 billion .

worth of pesticides a year, a fifth of them to
the Third World. In addition, local factories
make huge quantities of DDT and other
chemicals.

Major Exporters

West Germans export the most, but
Swiss, British, American, French, Japanese
and Dutch manufacturers also sell widely
in developing countries.

“Companies say they apply rigid con—
trols,” said Michael Hansen, a scientist with
the Consumers Union in Mount Vernon,
NY. “But that’s not what you see in the
field.”

To increase profits, he said, producers
encourage chemical use far beyond what is
safe or effective, resulting in a “pesticides
treadmill” with steadily more serious con—
sequences.

Odhiambo blames a well—organized
chemical lobby in Europe and the United
States, assisted by official foreign aid
programs and some United Nations agen—
cies, for encouraging sales despite the risk
to users.

“Some of them are not very honest,” he
said. “They tell us: ‘Since you are poor, you
should accept it. It’s not that bad.” ’

Industry executives acknowledge that
although they may seek to control misuse
of their chemicals, Third World conditions
make accidents and side effects all but
inevitable. ( o v e r )

> SPRAYING: Health Risks Ignored

-: .N., governmental and voluntary
guidelines prescribe elaborate controls and
warnings, but energetic local salesmen
«.often paid by commission—push their
products with abandon.

Third World nations, with agriculture as
their main hope to escape crushing debt,
rely ever more heavily on pesticides. Many
use paraquat and other toxic defoliants to
clear new land. ,

. William Hollis of the National Agricul-
tural Chemicals Assn. in Washington
agrees that some producers are lax in
policing their local agents because of
greater profits generated. .

“They’re blinking dollar signs,” he said.

Most companies press hard to improve
the image of pesticides but find independ-
ent distributors and pirate producers be-
yond their control, Hollis said.

Outdated World Health Organization
estimates say 500,000 people a year are
poisoned by pesticides. and 10,000 of them
die. Privately, WHO experts say the figures
are now at least double that.

And some specialists say actual figures
may be far higher and are mounting fast.

Farmers Dying

Michael Loevensohn, in the prestigious
British medical journal Lancet, found a
27% increase in deaths among Philippine
rice farmers during a period of high
pesticide use.

He estimates that tens of thousands of.
farmers were dying each year in Southeast
Asia alone. As a result, he said, accepted
worldwide figures seemed to be “substan—
tially underestimated.”

Pesticide deaths are often slow and
misreported. Poisoning, if not fatal, can
cripple for life. Little is known about
cancer risks or long-term effects on ner-
vous systems, fertility and immune‘sys-
tems. -

Isolated studies across the Third World
suggest an alarming picture.

A Kenyan scientist recently found moth-
ers’ milk with DDT levels 300 times above
accepted international norms. “I found no
milk without DDT,” said Laetitia Kanja,
“including my own.” '

Western authorities banned DDT be-
.cause it remained undeteriorated in-the
food chain, threatening predator birds,
among other species.

“Here we have so many other priorities,”
said one Kenyan scientist. “If you are
hungry, you don’t mind eating a little
DDT.”

Kenya is typical of Africa, where pesti-
cide use increases by more than 12% a
year. But in Asia and Latin America, where
farmers have more money to spend, the
problems are worse.

india's pesticide consumption—100,000
tons a year—is 20 times the 1960 level.

Parts of India’s Ganges River are too
porsonous for irrigation. One study showed
that at least 700 Sri Lankans commit
suicide each year by swallowing paraquat
or other easily available pesticides. '

Many countries are replacing DDT and
other organochlorines that remain in the
environment. But although alternative or-
ganophosphates break down rapidly, they
are highly toxic. And they are expensive.

Ben Waiyaki, a former sales manager in
Kenya for CIBAe-Geigy of Switzerland,
now studies pesticides for the Nairobi~
based U.N. Environment Program.

“I switched sides, and I know what I’m
talking about,” he said. “I sold chemicals
that we knew very little about. Salesmen
want to sell, to make money. It’s a vicious
circle.”

Government agricultural agents are
scarce and badly informed, Waiyaki said.
Farmers must rely on salesmen for infor*
mation on a bewildering array of products,
all requiring different dosages and tech
niques.

Across the Third World, farmers
often spray by calendar rather than
in response to pest invasion, apply-
ing up to 50 times more poison than
is necessary.

Many are sold by gaudy adver-
tising, such as a company in Brazil
that calls its product “200% safe.”

Major producers run ads showing
farmers spraying without required
masks and gloves.

Even if farmers learn proper
techniques, most reject hot, bulky
protective equipment. Pesticide
containers often are re-used to
carry food and water. Clothing
remains contaminated.

More often, farmers are ignorant
of the danger. '

“Sure, I use a lot of pesticides,”
said Dominick Karanja, who farms
near Nakuru in central Kenya.

Asked how he protected himself,
he shrugged: “When my brother
dies, I stop.”

Similar patterns are repeated
elsewhere on a larger scale.

Drop on the Tongue

In Thailand, David Bull found a
farmer who tested his mixture of
parathion by putting a drop on his
tongue. If his tongue went numb;
the dose was strong enough. If not,
he added more.

In Brazil, Darcy Bergman, who
quit selling pesticides to farm or-
ganically, told the West German
magazine Der .Uberbick he was
urged to lie to farmers to sell more
chemicals.

In Nicaragua, Doug Murray of
CARE filmed youngsters splashing
with gay abandon in a makeshift
tub, a barrel that recently
contained lethal methyl parathion. ‘

Consumers are often as much at
risk as farmers. In much of the
Third World, vegetables and fruits
are doused with fungicides ,con-
taining mercury immediately be-
fore shipment to markets.

Scattered incidents suggest the
bigger picture. A Brazilian doctor,
writing in the Jornal do Brasil, told
of a patient who ate a tomato fresh
from the fields and fell unconscious
from poisoning.

The United States imports $24.1
billion in food each year, and
authorities say that 6.1% of what

they test is in violation of food
safety laws.

Samples Checked

But the General Accounting Of -
fice found last year that only 1% of
imported food shipments are
checked for pesticide residues. Of—
ten fresh produce is eaten before
sample analyses are complete.

US. officials stopped the use of
ethylene dibromide, ‘or EDB, a
suspected carcinogen, on fruits
shipped to the United States from
the Caribbean. But farmers use
EDB widely to treat soil. The
Zimbabwe tobacco crop depends on
it.

Japanese consumer protection
groups found dangerous chemicals
on imported tea leaves.

Often pesticides are abused for
aesthetic purposes: foreign buyers
want unblemished fruits and vege-
tables;

Jose Lutzenburger, a Brazilian
organic farming expert, noted re-
cently that the best-looking apples
in his region were sprayed 37 times
and coated with wax to keep fungi-
cide in place.

The Pesticides Action Network.
a worldwide coalition of 300 groups.
campaigns against the “Dirty Doz-
en," 12 chemicals banned or re-
stricted in the West that are still
sold in the Third World.

Manufacturers argue that Third
World nations would starve with—
out the disputed pesticides. They
say some chemicals break down
faster in tropical conditions than in
temperate zones.

PAN, and a range of independent
scientists and specialists, counter
that widespread ignorance and lack
of proper facilities make many
pesticides even more dangerous in
developing countries.

Disputes within the industry
point out the problem.

“EBD is not dangerous once it
evaporates,” asserted Hollis. “But
I’d hate to be the guy applying it.”

Brian Hursey, Zimbabwe’s tsetse
fly eradication officer, offers to eat
_a spoonful of DDT when visitors
denounce the chemical. “Dieldrin
now, that stuff is murder,” he said.
“I almost died from it once.”

“The truth is nobody knows,”
said Raoul du Toit of the Zimbabwe
Department of Parks and Wildlife.
“They keep on splashing pesticides
on the ground without any idea of
the long-term impact. All they’re
doing is looking for evidence of
immediate effect.”

Du Toit decries what he calls a
double standard. Western coun—
tries set baseline standards at home

. but not for Third World countries

where they export banned or re-
stricted chemicals.

Congress AgainConfronts Hazards

 

By PHILIP suAsECoFF

 

- WASHINGTON
“ HE most alarming of all man’s asSaults
upon the’ environment is the contamination
‘ of air, earth, rivers, and sea with dangerous
and even lethal materials,” Rachel Clrso‘n
wrote a quarter of a century ago in her celebrated
book “Silent Spring.” Today there is little disagree-
ment with her warnings in regard to such broad-spec-
' trum pesticides as DDT, then widely used, now
banned. But there is still hot debate over how to apply,
' modern pesticides — which are designed to kill spe-
cific types of—weeds or insects — in ways that do not
harm people and their environment- .
. Hundreds of thousands of tons of pesticides are
‘ spread each year, but no one knows for sure about the
health effects of most of their ingredients. Everyone
' agrees on the need to find the answers more quickly,
and that is the central purpose of bills in Congress to
renew the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Roden-
ticide Act. But the bills are in trouble, tugged in oppo-

site directions by interest groups that just last year
were working in harness.

Last year, in the wake of headlines about pesti-
cide contamination of watermelons and cake mixes,
the chemical industry, environmentalists and other
interested parties forged a compromise to strengthen
the law, primarily by having manufacturers contrib-
ute to the cost of testing their products’ safety. It nar-
rowly missed enactment. Now the surprising amity
has all but vanished, and both sides are saying they
cannot support the pending bills.

.“Last year we came as close as we have in a dec-
ade” to amending the‘ pesticide law, said Luther W.
Shaw of the National Agricultural Chemicals Associa-
tion, a trade group representing virtually all the
major manufacturers of pesticides. “Now we have
moved a long way backwards.” ~ '

Mr. Shaw blamed environmentalists, who, he
said, had “reneged on the deal” cut last year by seek-

_ing additional and more stringent regulations. He con-

tended that the environmental organizations had been

for International Development,
said he turned down requests to
join European Economic Commu-
ni’ty aid programs to import pesti-
cides banned in home countries.

“We would have been morally
remiss," he said.

The UN. Food and Agriculture
Organization recently published an
international code on pesticides.
After nine- drafts, US. and other
Western delegates succeeded in
deleting a crucial aspect:

The code obliges exporters to
advise Third World countries of
Western restrictions on their prod-
ucts. But it does not require them to
wait for confirmation that import-
ers have taken note.

The concept is known as PIC,

prior informed consent. Producers .

say it is a needless restraint to
trade. Their critics say it is essen-
tial because of conditions in poor
countries.

In any case, experts say, the code
is not working. The Nairobi-based
Environment Liaison Center re-'
ported in June on 12 sample coun-
tries. It concluded: “The results are
very disturbing.”

Unmarked Bags

Inspectors fomid violations of
nearly every provision down to the
last point of retail sale: Deadly
chemicals were repackaged in un-
marked plastic bags and sold
alongside food.

Jan Huismans, director of the
UN. Environment Program’s reg-
istry of agricultural chemicals,
agrees the problem is critical and is
getting worse.

He said governments under

pressure to relieve mounting debt '

encourage the use of pesticides for

immediate crop results.
Third World governments subsi-

— dize up to 85% of , their pesticide

imports, providing cheap or free
chemicals to farmers. But few are
capable. of adequately balancing
their chemicals.

“then a government asks us for
datalabout a certain chemical, and
we don't know how to answer,"
Huismans said. “We could give
them documentation three yards
high." - . . , ' .

Sudan is a classic case of imbal-
ance.

Cotton is grown along the White

‘ Nile at Gezh'a, the world’s largest

farm. Too many chemicals were
dumped on 'Gezira, too often, creat-
ing resistances and altering the
ecological balance.

From 1960 to 1981, American
cotton farmers reduced their aver-
age annual sprayings from 12 to

i two. During that period, the Suda-

nese increased theirs from one to
eight. Now some spray 17 times.

Scourge in Sudan

Whitefly suddenly emerged as a
new scourge in Sudan. The crop
now depends on aldicarb, a highly

 

 

 

toxic poison used in the United

States only under rigid control, by
, specialists in protective gear.

’Farmers, sometimes barefoot

and naked to the waist, splash
aldicarb with their hands and carry
it home to their families. Despite
5 increased doses, Sudanese cotton is

sticky from whitefly. .
Desperately poor, Sudan each

- year imports nearly two pounds of
pesticide per inhabitant, counting
‘nnmads in the barren north. As

elsewhere in Africa, Sudan’s land
grows steadily less productive.

Isolated successes offer some
encouragement in developing
countries. Integrated pest manage-
ment combines limited chemicals
with biological control and natural
predators.

In Nicaragua, farmers combat

weevils with trap-cropping: A

patch of cotton is planted early,
attracting the season's population
of weevils to a small area where
they are sprayed heavily.

But such programs require a

careful balance, spraying correct

amounts of the right chemical, and

l planting other crops to coincide
| with insect breeding cycles

John Phillips, FAO representa-

- tive in Kenya, explains the prob-

lem:' .

“Any Third World nation can:
produce a Nobel Prize winner.
What they lack are enough good‘
bottle-washers. It. is a question of:
management, of overseeing the
control of chemicals." I

Most peasant farmers, and many i
governments, prefer the immediate ;
results of chemicals, Waiyaki said. ‘
“They see the insect fall dead. It is :
magic. They don’t think of long-;
term danger.”

 

Many Third World countries
produce their own poisons, some-
times under license but often in
small pirate plants with little su-
pervision. DDT is produced widely
in Asia.

Few countries can afford to
combat the human and ecological
damage of pesticides, let alone pay
for the research necessary to find
alternatives to protect their crops.

“People don’t realize what a job it
is to produce effective chemicals,"
Hollis said. “These days a company
has to have sales of at least $1
billion to afford - research and de-
velopment.”

Federal regulations on chemical
producers run to 75 pages, Hollis
said, and products require years of
testing. ' .

Sharp divisions over pesticides
worsen the problem, experts con-
clude.

Lukas Brader, the FAO’s chief of
plant protection, worries that over-
reaction to pesticides ties authori-
ties’ hands so that vital crops are
lost needlessly.

“We couldn’t stop desert locusts
in Sudan because of too many
objections to the chemicals we
needed to use,” he said. “By the
time locusts reached the stuff we
sprayed, it had lost its effect.”

Without a well-managed pro-
gram of spraying against insects,
fungus and weeds, he said, devel—
oping countries could not grow
enough food or cash crops to
survive. -

At the same time, Brader said
that pesticide abuse in the Third
World is a worsening crisis. “It is a
mess. You can’t believe what you
see sometimes."

 




(continued)

encouraged to try for “a nigger bite of the apple” by
the fact that Senator Jesse Helms, the conservative
North Carolina Republican, was replaced as chair-
man of the Senate Agriculture Committee by Senator
Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who has
called pesticide reform a top priority.

But according to Janet Hathaway, a pesticides
expert for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental policy and litigation group, the consen-
sus began falling apart last fall. The compromise bill
was not enacted then, she said, because of “exces-
sive” last-minute demands by industry and by agri-

culture, which uses 70 percent of the $4 billion worth -
of pesticides sold each year. There is still agreement,
on a number of key issues, Ms. Hathaway said, but
“every procedural issue is becoming a bittleground.” l

Senator Leahy said, “We have had 3 many meet-

ings and I have spoken so many places and worked 3

very strenuously with environmentalists, manufac- .
turers and users. If we have any kind of bipartisan ‘
legislation, there will be a Senate bill this year.” But
he added, “I don’t know about the House.”

In “Silent Spring,” Rachel Carson, a biologist and ,
geneticist, warned that the indiscriminate use of ,
chemical pesticides was poisoning the natural world
and threatening human beings with cancer and other ‘
illnesses. Her book, excoriated by the chemical indus-
try, played a major role in awakening an environmen-
tal consciousness in the United States and elsewhere.
A decade later it led to the banning of a number of

pesticides, including DDT, and to a law requiring that s

new products meet strict safety standards.

However, the law permitted sale of chemicals al-
ready on the market —- many of which were even then
suspected of causing cancer, birth defects, neurologi-
cal disease and other illness — until their effects
could be re-evaluated. In 15 years the Environmental
Protection Agency has banned the use of 32 of the 600
active pesticide ingredients in that category, and an ‘
additional 47 were taken off the market voluntarily '
after the agency began regulatory action. But hun-

E.P.A. Looks at Alachlor

dreds of ingredients remain to be reevaluated, and at
its current rate of 25 ingredients a year, it is generally
estimated that the EPA. will'not finish the job until
the next century. Meanwhile, new ingredients are
being devised and must be evaluated, too.

Last year’s legislation, like this year’s, would re—-
quire pesticide makers to help pay for the reevalua-
tions, enabling the agency to move more rapidly. But
last year the manufacturers’ contribution was tobe
$150,000 per chemical tested; the current Senate bill
would incnease that to as much as $750,000, which the
chemical companies call unacceptably high. E.P.A.
officials contend that that sum would have to be paid
for relatively few pesticides.

The industry also objects to a provision that
would require separate appropriations from Con-
gress to pay a manufacturer’s losses if a. pesticide is
ordered off the market as a result of the tests. The
E.P.A., however, says this change is urgently needed
if it is to carry out its mission. At present the environ-
mental agency must pay the manufacturer’s indem-
nity from its budget for pesticides programs, which,
at $60 million a year, could be swallowed up by cancel-
lation of one pesticide. For instance, if the EPA. wins
its court fight to ban dinoseb, a popular weedkiller
linked to birth defects and sterility, the agency will
have to pay some $100 million in disposal costsalqne.
Indeed, Senator Leahy, like environmentalists and
some E.P.A. officials, asks why a chemical maker
should be compensated for an unsafe product.

Another sticking point is a proposal to stiffen a re—
quirement that underground water supplies be pro-
tected from pesticides; industry regards the changes
as unduly stringent, while environmentalists say they
do not protect water supplies well enough.

Ms. Hathaway of the Natural Resources Defense

Council said that in the 25 years that have passed’

since the publication of “Silent Spring,” Americans
have become educated about the dangers of pesti-v
cides and are “really insisting on legislation.” But
Lee M. Thomas, head of the E.P.A., said Wednesday
that a new pesticide bill now seems less likely be-
cause the coalition that supported it last yearseems
to have"‘gone out of existence.”

Miss Carson, who died «:;:=,Tf , anger in 1961,

Americans Series in 1981 Following is a
passage from the book:

Along with the possibility of the extinction
of mankind by nuclear war, the central
problem of our age has therefore become the
contamination .of man’s total environment ’
with such substances of incredible potential
for harm —- substances that accumulate in
the tissues of plants and animals and even
penetrate the germ cells to shatter or alter
the very material of heredity upon which the
shape of the future depends. . . . It is ironic to
think thatman might determine his own
future by something so seemingly trivial as
the choice of an insect spray.

All this has been risked -— for what?
Future historians may well be amazed by our]
distorted sense of proportion. How could / ’
intelligent beings seek to control a few
unwanted species by a method that
contaminated, the entire environment and
brought the threat of disease and death even/
to their own kind? Yet this is precisely what
we have done. . .' .

- All this is nm to say there is no insect
problem and no need of control. I am saying,
rather, that control must be geared to
realities, not to mythical situations, and that
the methods employed must be such that
they do not destroy us along with the insects.

LACHLOR, sold by the
Monsanto Company since

1969 under the trade name ,

Lasso, is perhaps the most widely
used herbicide produced in this
country. Up to 84 million pounds of
it is sprayed on fields of corn,
sdybeans and‘peanuts each year.

In 1984, in the course of its re-
evaluation program for pesticides
long in use, the Environmental
Protection Agency concluded that
alachlor might cause cancer in
human beings and might also be
’ contaminating underground water

supplies in agricultural areas. But
.that was only the beginning of the
‘ ponderous procedure set up by the
1972 pesticides law — a procedure
that would not be materially
simplified by any of the bills now
before Congress.

Based on the preliminary
findings, the agency began a
“special review” to determine if
alachlor was such a threat as to
outweigh the economic and social
benefits of its use. It required the
company to submit additional data
not only on the chemical itself, but
also on the benefits of using it.

A year ago the agency reported
that alachlor was a “probable”
cancer-causing agent presenting
risks that ranged from one cancer
case per 100,000 people exposed
over a lifetimeto one case in 10
million, depending on the nature
and level of exposure. Those
exposed include farm workers who
apply alachlor, consumers who eat
food tainted with‘it and residents of
areas whose drinking water has
been contaminated by agricultural
runoff.

But canceling all uses of the
chemical would mean $510 million

study. So the E.P.A. proposed to
put some restrictions on the use of
alachlor: requiring protective ‘
clothing for farm workers applying
it, allowing only certified
applicators to use it and requiring
warnings about its dangers on the
label.

The agency then asked for
comments on its proposal.-

Environmental groups Ide-

manded that the use of alachlor be ,

canceled immediately, saying that

i Rachel
* Carson

the agency had exaggerated the .

benefits of the chemical and'under-

'estimated its risks. Farmers and

other users wanted fewer restric~ .

tions on its use. And Monsanto,
argued that the product should not

be labeled a probable human car-‘
cinogen.

The agency is scheduled to an-
nounce its decision on alacthr in
November. But any decision can be
appealed through administrative
channels. If that appeal is denied,
any party can then take its case to
the courts, delaying final action for
years. PHILIP SHABECOFF

Key Pesticide BanTP—uts Farmers Between
Envzronment, Economics

Scripps Howard News Service

The bald eagle reigns over the waters and
woods of Reelfoot Lake in Tennessee.

The fat pocketbook mussel squirms at the
bottom ofthe St. Francis River in Arkansas.

Theseand other endangered species have
farmers across the country caught between
economics and environmental concerns.

“What the heck good is a mussel anyway?”
asked Dean Williams, a St. Francis County,
Ark. “lfyou can’t tell what good they do, who
cares ifthey go extinct?"

At issue now is an Environmental Protec-
tion Agency directive that farmers will not be
allowed to use many of their most effective
pesticides in areas where endangered species
might be harmed. The restrictions begin Feb.
1. 1988. Across the country, crops. pastures,
forests. ranges and mosquito-control pro-
grams in 900 counties will be affected by the
EPA action. Of those, 382 counties have
affected croplands. Fuller details outlining
the speciﬁc restrictions are expected to be
published by the EPA in about a month.

But this much is known: The EPA. which
lists the names of active ingredients in pesti-
cides. rather than the brand names of the
chemicals, will include a number of the most
heavily used pesticides. According to a
survey of pesticide producers, extension
agents, trade groups and industry represen-
.tatives, some of the brands to be listed are
Temik, Treflan, Atrazine, Lannate. Captan,
Pounce, Ammo, Ambush and Dinoseb.

Spectracide, a chemical commonly used in
home gardens, also is on the list.

OCTOBER 16, 1987

The EPA decision came after the agency
received a “jeopardy opinion“ from the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service that said the pesti-
cides could put several plants, birds, ﬁsh and
other animals in danger.

“We’re not out to tell the farmersf they
absolutely can't use pesticides," said Jim
Widlak, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Asheville, NC. “We're
just out to see that the endangered species
are protected while the farmers work." ,

Many farmers, however, fear the restric-
tions will mean higher production costs and
lower yields. i

EPA ofﬁcials hope the restrictions will
mean survival for some endangered wildlife.

Don Rawlins, director of the American
Farm Bureau Federation’s natural and envi-
ronmental resources division in Park Ridge,
111., said the farm bureau is planning to ﬁght
the order.

“Lawsuits have been the sort of thing the
environmentalists have been using to take
care of their concerns." said Rawlins. “We
very well may have to do some suit-ﬁling our-
selves.”

At the National Cotton Council, concern
centers on the decision’s impact on ridding
cotton ﬁelds of such disastrous insects as the
boll weevil and bollworm.

“If this Endangered Species Act is promul-
gated and enforced. it has the potential for

,

questionable—and in fact, the coin '

bringing agriculture to its knees more than
any other law, federal, environmental or
otherwise,” said Dr. Jim Brown, manager of
production technology for the council.

Brown said no good substitutes exist for
the cotton pesticides on the list and that
eliminating use in some areas could threaten
pest-control programs.

The EPA is responsible for recommending
alternatives to the banned chemicals, Widlak
said, adding this, has not happened.

Effective alternatives are available, said
EPA biologist Rick Stevensin Washington.
But he did not name any.

In the pesticide industry, the cost of the de-
cision will be “tremendous," said Susan
Wendler, manager of agribusiness services
for FMC Co. of Philadelphia, the company
that makes Pounce and Ammo insecticides.

John McCarthy, director of scientiﬁc affairs
for the National Agricultural Chemical Asso-
ciation, said he‘s urging companies to ﬁght
the change.

“I think the EPA ought to go through a
more formal process before making these de-
cisions," said McCarthy.

On the farm, though, Williams is only
worried about the results.

“You know if we take all these chemicals
off the market. I don’t know how we’ll make
it. It looks to me like the farmer is getting to
be the endangered species."

Australia pays to rid its beef of DDT and dieldrin

HE GOVERNMENT of Australia last
week pledged funds to help clean up
and monitor residues of harmful pesticides
in beef exports. Last month, the beef
industry escaped near-collapse as the US
agreed to lift a four-month ban on imports
of meat from Australia.

The US had banned the products
because customs officials had discovered
residues of the pesticides DDT and dieldrin
in nine separate shipments of meat.

The funds, announced in the budget last
week by Australia’s treasurer, Paul
Keating, amount to some A$5-5 million.
The government awarded A54 million to
its own national residue survey. It will use
the money to set up its own database and
to widen testing of animals destined

the country, where levels of organochlorine
in meat are exceptionally high.

The revelations have led to calls from
consumer federations in Australia for
assurances that local beef produce is not
contaminated. Australia banned the use of
DDT on its farms a few months ago. A ban
on the use of dieldrin came into effect on 1
August. Some of the shipments affected
came from farms where owners had used
dieldrin to protect crops of potatoes against
Wire worm, a practice recommended by
agricultural officers of the government.
Unfortunately for the farmers, the residues
of dieldrin persist in. the soil for up to 25
years. ‘

Other contamination with pesticides is
thought to have arisen from the use by
farmers of organochlorine pesticides to
control termites in buildings and in fences.
This is still allowed. The authorities suspect
farmers of using up stocks of the banned
chemicals b spraying them indiscrimi-
nately onto telds.

The government introduced new testing
procedures at the beginning of this month.
Analysts will test individual samples of
meat from every farm that supplies cattle to
abattoirs.

There are now fears that mutton and
lamb may also be affected by the
contamination. The Australian overn-
ment has stepped up tests to monitor for
such problems. [:1

for export. Another A$SOOOOO goes to
the Australian Meat and Livestock
Corporation, which will test suspect meat
returned from export.

The government also plans to share with
each individual state the costs of collecting
all the stockpiled pesticides from farmers.
The joint funds for this amount to A$2
million.

The governments of both Japan and
Canada threatened to ban imports of
Australian meat after customs officials
in those countries had found similar resi-
dues

Japan reported four more tainted
consignments last week, but has not
imposed a ban. Since discovering the
contamination, the Australian government
has quarantined some 50 farms throughout

Two sides of Shell

 

I am rather confused about Shell’s
policy regarding conservation and
wildlife. The ‘Shell Wild Side of
Town Competition’ in the July
issue seems to me incompatible
with the fact that Shell exports—
and actively promotes the use of—
Dieldrin to, among other countries,
Botswana and Zimbabwe.

The World Commission on Envi-
ronment and Development has
concluded that pesticide overuse
and abuse threatens human
health and wildlife, and under—
mines the development of sustain—
able and viable agriculture.

Perhaps the promoters of Shell
as a company concerned about
wildlife could clarify its real posi-
tion? John Meek,

Whetstone, London

it is the policy of all Shell com—
panies to apply the best practic-

 

able means to preserve air, water,

' soil, and plant and animal life from

adverse effects of their operations
and to endeavour to provide prod—
ucts, together with practical
advice on their application, which
will not cause injury to health or
undue impact on the environment.

To control the tsetse fly—a
major cause of serious diseases to
both man and cattle in Africa——

Die/drin has been applied, at the
request of the authorities in Bots-
wana, to parts of the trunks of trees
which the fly is known to favour. At
present, Die/drin is still the most
effective chemical in controlling
these pests.

Overuse and abuse of pes-
ticides must be prevented to the
maximum extent possible, and,
indeed, She/l companies and the
pesticide industry, through their
support of the Food and Agricul-
ture Organisation (FAO) code of
conduct, are making a lot of prog-
ress in training farmers in the cor-
rect use of pesticides.

Pesticides play an essential role
in protecting food crops. Even with
the use of agrochemica/s, it is esti-

 

 

mated that a third of the world’s
potential food production is still
being lost before harvest and a
further 15 per cent lost between
harvest and consumption. The
world population increases by 2
per cent each year (200,000
people a day), and the FAO esti-
mates that agricultural output by
the year 2000 will have to double
to satisfy demand. In the past 50
years, food production in the West
has increased 10-fo/d, thanks in
part to the responsible develop-
ment and use of pesticides.

Your readers will understand
that Shell’s concern for wildlife is
matched by concern for genuine
efforts to sustain human life. We
recognise, of course, that many
vital products and processes can
have unfortunate side-effects if
misused. This is why Shell is at the
forefront of research to introduce,
progressively, new, less hazard-
ous and more selective products.

DioXin in Paper Products Raises Concern at EPA

Levels of Cancer- Causing Agent Slightly Higher Than Agency Considers Acceptable

 

By Michael Weisskopf

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

A preliminary study of dioxin in everyday paper
products shows that five of seven items sampled
pose a slightly higher risk of cancer than the En-
vironmental Protection Agency considers accept-
able, according to a report released yesterday.

The assessment of risk, based on hypothetical
assumptions and written by the consulting firm
of Arthur D. Little Inc., “does not warrant any
immediate action," said Bill Waugh, of the EPA's
Ofﬁce of Toxic Substances, because the conser-
vative assumptions may have overstated the ex-

tent of exposure to the toxic chemical.

Still, said Waugh, the findings of elevated can-
cer risks in coffee filters, uncoated paper plates,
disposable diapers, tampons and paper towels

 

“raise some concern” and underline the need for
in-depth government investigation.

Last month, the paper industry revealed that
trace amounts of dioxin were found in a wide
range of its products. The EPA, which had
turned up small quantities of dioxinin the sludge,
effluent and pulp of paper mills, had anticipated
the product ﬁndings early last year and commis-
sioned the assessment.

Seven common items were evaluated based on
assumptions about the frequency of product use,
dioxin levels and the rate of dioxin’s migration
from the product and human absorption. .

The projected risks of dioxin in the products
were compared to the EPA’s standard of no
more than one additional cancer for every one
million people.

Only coffee ﬁlters showed a substantially high-

er risk. Assuming that the consumer used one
filter daily for 50 years, that each filter contained.
10 parts per trillion of dioxin (a level commonly
found in pulp in the mill study) and that half of
that dose was absorbed by the coffee drinker,
then the risks of cancer would rise to one addi-
tional case for every 10,000 people, according to
the report.

The plates, diapers, tampons and towels
showed lifetime risks ranging from 1.4 to 6.6
extra cases of cancer per one million people.

Dinner napkins and uncoated sheets of paper
showed risks below the EPA standard.

Waugh said that since the consultant probably
overestimated the assumptions of the study lev-
els, it is “highly unlikely that the consumer ac-
tually experiences risks" at the level cited by
Little.

 




 

Applications to Canada increase tenfold

THE GLOBE AND'MAIL, WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1987

U.S. steps up requests to dump toxins

BY DEBORAH WILSON
The Globe and Mail

 

, '. Tough waste controls by the U.S.
Government have led to more than
a tenfold increase since 1980 in bids
by U.S. companies seeking to dump
waste in Canada, according to an
official monitoring the requests.
Ontario has become a net import-
er of hazardous wastes destined for
treatment and disposal, the Ontario
Environment Ministry says.

, Records obtained under the US.
Freedom of Information Act from
the Environmental Protection
Agency show there were more than
400 requests for permission to ex-
port hazardous industrial wastes
from the United States to Canadian
treatment and landfill operations.
Few requests are turned down, fig-
ures show.

,Wendy .Grieder, international
activities specialist for .the EPA,
said that there were about 30 re
quests in 1980.

, '“We’re seeing a rise in exports to
Canada,” Ms Grieder said in an
interview from Washington. “It
looks to me that we send up a lot

more than you send to us.”

She attributed the change to “the
impact of regulations, and the cost
of doing business in this country.”

Because of tough new U.S. laws,
Ms Grieder said, “we’ve got a situa-
tion now where landfill sites are
being closed up.”

Officials in Ottawa said‘they- have
not yet determined whether Canada
receives more ' hazardous wastes
than it exports under a new Canada-
U. S. system for monitoring ship-
ments.

But Ontario, at least, has become
a net importer of hazardous wastes,
said Ron Gotts, director of the
waste management division of the
Ohtario Environment Ministry,

Between January and April this
year, 18, 843, 455 kilograms of haz-
ardous wastes wereimported from
the United States, according to
Government estimates. Exports to
the United States totalled 7,116,542
kilograwms

Mr. Gotts said precise compari-
sons before 1985 are not possible
because of changes in the types of
hazardous waste shipments moni-
tored in Ontario.

Under a Canada-U.S. bilateral
agreement that took effect in
November, Canada is informed of
all requests for hazardous waste
exports, and the United States will
stop any shipment to which Canada
objects.

But the vast majority are not
opposed.

Of 432 notices of U.S. export re-
quests received between July 28,
1986, and Aug. 25 this year, Canada
registered objections to 51. (Envi-
ronment Canada forwards the ex-
port requests to the province des-
tined to receive the shipment, be-
cause waste disposal and treatment
is provincially regulated.)

Frequently, Canadian objections
to the export requests are made
because forms have not been ﬁlled
out correctly, or information is
missing, and the objections'are lift-

ed when the proper information is '

provided, Ms Grieder said. Other
objections arise if the request con-
cerns a type of waste that a treat-
ment plant is not licenced to-handle,
said Robert Booth, senior project
manager for waste management in
Environment Canada’s Ontario
reglon.

Environmentalists battle Shell Canada
over proposed sour gas Wells near park

BY KEVIN COX
The Globe and Mail

CALGARY

A proposal to drill two sour gas
wells near Waterton Lakes National
Park has pitted international envi-
ronmental groups against petrole-
um giant Shell Canada Ltd. and set
residents of the area against each
other.

Calgary-based Shell is scheduled
to put its application to drill the
wells in a wilderness area 20 kilo-
metres northeast of Pincher Creek
before a panel of the Alberta Ener-
gy Resources Conservation Board
tomorrow.

The environmental groups, which
include the Canadian Wildlife Fed-
eration, the Alberta Wilderness
Association, the Washington-based
Wilderness Society and the Great
Bear Foundation of Missoula,
Mont., say drilling the wells and
carving roads into the wilderness
will open up the area to motorized
vehicles and wipe out herds of big-
hom sheep and grizzly bears.

For many of these groups, the
drilling proposal is the latest in a
long string of developments in the
Rocky Mountains that have that
have reduced the numbers of sheep
and bears.

 

“We would have only moderate
concern about this project were it
not for many other developments,
including the 1988 Winter Olympic
Games and numerous other energy-
drilling projects existing and pro-
posed from Calgary southward to
Montana,” Lance Olson of the Great
Bear Foundation wrote in a submis-
sion to the AERCB.

The AWA, which has lobbied for a

long time against development near .

the Waterton park, has yet to file a
submission with the AERCB. and is
seeking more time to bring in three
wildlife experts to discuss the possi-
ble consequences of the drilling
program.

However, a spokesman for the
board said yesterday that no more
delays (the hearings were delayed
once in mid-August) are being can-
templated.

Shell, which has 46 natural gas
wells in the scenic Waterton dis-
trict, insiSts it has taken appropri-
ate measures to protect wildlife in
the area. -

Gerald Kroc, Shell spokesman,
said the company has done a year-
long study of the Sheep population in
the area to be drilled and has out-
lined the steps to be taken to protect
the animals; about 50 sheep were

well, Shell has set up an emergency \

response and evacuation plan for
the area in case of a blow-out at one
of the potentially volatile wells with
large quantities of hydrogen sul-
phide or rotten-egg gas.

No economic evaluation of the
well was provided by Shell.

The rift between the development

and environmental factions appears _

Widest at Pincher Creek. ,

“Our mountains are more impor-
tant than the money that could be
lever be revenued from these two
wells,” Elizabeth Judd wrote in her
submission to,the board.

But the Pincher Creek Economic
Development Board wrote to the
AERCB that it “fully supports” the
drilling of the two wells, because of
the petroleum revenue that would
come into the community.

The letter, from economic devel- '

opment board chairman Susan Aris,
also states: “The opposition to the
proposed drilling has not come from
area residents, who, logically,
would have been the most affected
by the development. ”

But the stink of rotten eggs from
sour gas wells in the area has been
a source of controversy in the area
for decades.

“We have also been driven out of

spotted in a consultant’s SWGY AS l our homes because of wells that

There are U.S. treatment plants
available for wastes produced by
U.S. companies, Ms Grieder said,
but “I have found that most people
go up (to Canada) because it’s eco-
nomically beneficial to them.”

Canadian treatment plants are
often nearer to U.S. waste produc.
ers than the nearest American
plant, and the weaker dollar gives
Canadian firms an advantage, she
said.

The imported hazardous wastes,
depending on type, are treated-and
placed in landfill sites, or destroyed
in incinerators. Ontario also moni-
tors the movement ofwastes head- ~
ed for recycling plants, and those
shipments are included in the prov-
ince ’s calculations of hazardous
waste imports.

Though recyclable wastes, such

. as oils and dry-cleaning solvents,

arenot considered to be truly haz-
ardous, Mr. Gotts said, they are
monitored because “recycling can
sometimes be a cloak for other ac-
tivities . . . That’s how you end up
with PCBs in oil.”

Colin Isaacs, executive director
of ' the activist group Pollution
Probe, said that while many‘people
are opposed'to the idea of accepting
another country’s hazardous
wastes, he thinksproperdisposal of
the wastes is more important that

.“the nationality of the wastes.

“I don’t- get too het up about the
existence of political boundaries.
They aren’t respected by pollutants
in the environment,” Mr. Isaacs
said.

Two major landfill and incinera-
tor centres in Quebec. and Ontario
that process much of the imported
hazardous wastes use an adequate
system of stabilizing and destroying
the wastes, he said

Mr. Isaacs said the monitoring

system for imports is about as thora
ough as it can be.

“I would prefer it come into
Canada and be properly destroyed
and properly disposed of than stay

THE ECONOMIST 1 on asbestos 13311591113101: stance OCTOBER 1,1987

 

 

n industry that has seen ex-
ports to its rich—country
markets slump in the past
10 years is selling much

more of its dangerous product to de-
veloping nations. Canada is the
world’s second-largest asbestos pro-
ducer (after Russia), and the largest
exporter of the stuff. The Canadian
government has chosen to develop
new export markets rather than let
the industry die —— and with it 3, 000
jobs.

Some of the govemment’s selling
techniques would not pass muster

Thailand’s imports of milled asbes-
tos from Canada rose by 65 percent,
to 16,491 tons, in the four years to
1986. Telexes between Canada’s
external-affairs department in Ot-
tawa and its representatives in
Bangkok show that the Canadians
persuaded the Thais not to place
skull-and-crossbones labels on bags
of asbestos entering the country. In
Canada and the United States, where
there is a legal obligation to warn
workers of the health hazards of as-
bestos, warning symbols must ap-
pear on all bags of the material.

Canadian officials justify their
behavior by arguing that Canada’s
so-called white asbestos is less dan-
gerous than blue crocidolite, the
other main variety, most of which
comes from South Africa. That line
has been swallowed by Britain and
other Western European govern-
ments. The Canadians have also en-
listed the help of the International
Labor Organization in Geneva,
which says only that crocidolite and
the spraying of all asbestos should
be banned.

This ignores the best medical evi-
dence. The foremost authority on as-
bestosis and related diseases, Dr. Ir-
ving J. Selikoff of New York’s Mount
Sinai School of Medicine, studied the
deaths among 17,800 asbestos work-
ers in Canada and the United States
over 10 years. Dr. SelikOff found that
40 percent of deaths in the group he
studied were caused by asbestos ex-
posure. Most of the victims inhaled
only white asbestos. None was ex-
posed to crocidolite.

Canada’s
asbestos
push

asbestos is mined in Quebec —— most
of that by La Societe .Nationale de
l’Amiante, which was set up as a
crown corporation by the provincial
government in May 1978. The rest of
Canada’s asbestos comes from Brit-
ish Columbia and Newfoundland. In
1986 Canada’s asbestos mines cut
production by 15 percent and ex-
ported only 752,000 tons, about half
the volume of a decade earlier. But
that is because exports to the devel-
oped world have fallen faster than
exports to poorer countries have
risen.

Last year America’s Environmen-
tal Protection Agency proposed a
ban on all imports of asbestos, and it
wants to order the removal of asbes—
tos from 31,000 schools attended by
15 million schoolchildren. In 1986
Canada exported only about 150,000
tons of asbestos to the United States,
roughly a fifth as much as it did 10
years ago.

Although the final decision has
yet to be made, an American asbes-
tos embargo wOuld hit Canada’s as-
bestOs industry hard, and not just
through its exports to America. It
would encourage other governments
to tighten their own laws governing
the import, handling and use of as-
bestos. Demand for asbestos in West-
ern Europe has already fallen by al-
most 50 percent between 1979 and
1985.

So Canada is paying lobbyists to
stage a campaign to reinvigorate as-
bestos exports. Hill & Knowlton Inc.,
a big public-relations company, has
been retained to put the case for
Canada’s asbestos industry in Wash-
ington. The Canadian government
has set aside $26 million to be paid
over seven years to the Asbestos In-
stitute, an industry body which does
a lot of promotion and a little re-
search.

Some of that money has already
been spent on trade missions to
Latin America, Thailand and South
Korea. Last year the asbestos indus-

try in Canada paid host to 27 ambas-
sadors and 29 diplomats from 50
countries. From the industry’s point
of View, some of this seems to have
been time and money well spent. Be-
tween 1982 and 1986, exports to A1-
geria rose by 1,035 percent, to 20,031
tons. Sales to Sri Lanka went up 364
percent, those to South Korea
climbed 198 percent and sales to
Chile rose 176 percent.

Asbestos is too deadly to be al-
lowed to boom. Last year two
projects in Nigeria, partly financed
by the US. Agency for International
Development, were put on hold be—

cause they involved the use of asbes-
tos pipe. One of the Canadian gov-
ernment’s big worries is that the
World Bank and other institutions
may refuse to lend money for Third
World projects involving the use or
processing of asbestos —— thus shut-
ting off many of Canada’s new-found
outlets. That was one reason the
Canadian governments (central and
provincial) last year created a spe-
cial fund to pay for anti—EPA propa-
ganda and for claques at EPA’s public
hearings.

Has all this made Canada’s asbes—
tos industry any healthier? All the
signs are that it has just become
poorer, and should not be propped
up. SN A has made no capital invest-
ment for the past three years. The
financial condition of SNA moved
Raymond Savoie, Quebec’s minister
of mines, to say: “It’s a catastrophe.
It defies any kind of economic com-
mon sense. The more I get into it the
more it becomes a horror story.”

Not, sadly, anything like the hor-
rors that could await unsuspecting
workers in the Third World.

ALASKA SEEKS HALT
TO PLUTONIUM PLAN

State Sues U.S. Over Proposal
to Fly Material to Japan
-.... Health Risk Cited

 

 

 

By HAL SPENCER
- Special to The New York Times

ANCHORAGE, Oct. 3 ~— Alaska has
filed suit against the Federal Govern—
ment to block proposed shipments of
plutonium from Europe to Japan that
might require a fuel stop in the state.

The Secretaries of State and Energy
have approved the shipment plan and
sent it to President Reagan for action,
court records show. Noting those ap~
provals, Federal District Judge James
Fitzgerald refused Friday to grant a
temporary restraining order against
the plan, but he said he would hold
hearings on the case.

The suit, filed Sept. 23 by Gov. Steve
COWper, says there is no way to guar-
antee safe air transport of plutonium, a
deadly radioactive compound used in
bombs and nuclear reactors.

Mr. Cowper, a first-term Democrat,
said that for months his aides sought a
plan from Federal officials “that con-
vinces me Alaskans and our envirOn-
ment will be safe if one of these plutoni-
um-carrying planes goes down near-
b 9’

‘.‘I’m not satisfied with the platitudes
we’ve received, so I had no choice but
to file this suit,” Mr. Cowper said.

Classified Proceedings

The head of the state’s Washington
office, John Katz, said that the pro-
posed agreement “and the entire ana-
lytic process” have been classified.
Federal officials, including Washington
spokesmen for the Departments of
State and Energy, today declined com-
ment on the case. Dean Dunsmore, the
Federal lawyer handling the case here,
also refused to discuss it.

This secrecy, especially the lack of
public discussion of possible environ-
mental effects, was cited by the state in
its opposition to the proposed agree-
ment. Federal environmetal law re-

quires public participation in the devel- .

opment of any environmental impact
statement, the state noted in papers
filed with the suit.

According to documents filed with
the suit, Japan is now sending spent nu-
clear reactor fuei to France and the
United Kingdom for reprocessing “in
order to extract reusable components,
specifically plutonium.” Japan will use
the radioactive material in a new gen-
eration Of nuclear power plants, the
documents say.

Tons of Plutonium

In 30 years, under the proposal, thou-
sands of pounds of plutonium would be
flown to Japan on a polar route requir-
ing a refueling stop in Alaska, the suit
said. State officials said such stops
would most likely be made in Anchor-
age, home to about half the state’s
530,000 people.

The suit contends that the Federal
Government has violated the National
Environmental Policy Act in the way it

’negotiated the agreements among the

United States, Japan and the European
Atomic Energy Community.

The agreements, the suit asserts,
“approve in “advance long-term ship»
ments of plutonium by air through the
United States, and in particular, Alas-
ka, without discussing, considering or

‘ analyzing the environmental impacts

of their decisions.”

A letter to Mr. Cowper signed by Sec-
retaryof State George P. Shultz, was
submitted with the suit. “The US. will

, undertake to give its approval to the

European Atomic Energy Community
(Euratom) for the return to Japan of
Japanese plutonium recovered through
reprocessing in France and the United
Kingdom,” the letter said.

The approval, the letter said, “will be
conditioned upon a number of safety
requirements such as transfer exclu-
sively by air (to minimize time spent in
international transit), use of a cask
certifiedto withstand a crash, armed
guards, redundant communications
and detailed contingency plans.”

Mr. Shultz, Mr. Reagan and Energy
Secretary John S. Herrington are
\among the officials named as defend-
ants in the suit.

Role in Bomb Production

Japan’s plutonium derives from ura- 'i

nium mined in the United States. Under
nonproliferation agreements covering

the spread of nuclear weapons, ship- _

ments would require approval by the
President and the Senate. Relatively

small amounts of plutonium can be

used to make nuclear weapons. Alas-
ka’s two Senators and one Representa-
tive, all Republicans, have not taken
positions on the proposal.

Mr. Shultz acknowledged in the letter i

that the Governments involved pre-
ferred a polar route “or another route
that avoids civil disorder and natural
disasters.” .
i “It is true, as reported,” the letter
added, “that Japan is considering a
route that would include a refueling
stop in Alaska.” '

Mr. Katz, director of Alaska’s Wash-
ington office, said that Canadian offi-
cials have indicated serious reserva-
tions about flights carrying plutonium
stopping in or flying over that country.

No Safe Container

Among other assertions, Alaska’s
suit contends that no shipping contain-
ers “capable of safe, efficient, large-
scale air shipment of plutonium” have
been developed. ,

The suit, prepared by assistant
Alaska Attorney General-Michele D.
Brown, described” large-scale health
risks of a plutonium accident. “Studies

have calculated that the release of 2.8

pounds of plutonium from an aircraft
accident could cause as many as
500,000 people to develop lung cancer,”
the suit said.

Dr. Marvin Resnikoff, a University
of Michigan physicist, said in an affida-
vit filed with the suit that plutonium is
one of the most, “if not the most,” toxic
substances known to humans. “Inhal-
ipg s tmopic speck could lead to
dancer,” he said. 3, ‘

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2 —- An interna-

France today to pay more than $8.1
; million in damages to Greenpeace, an
'environmentalist and antinuclear
group, for the deliberate sinking two
years ago of the group’s-ship, the Rain-
bow Warrior. .

The vessel, which had been about to
lead a Greenpeace flotilla in a cruise
protesting French nuclear testing in
the Pacific, was sunk by an explosion
on July 10, 1985, in the harbor of Auck-
land, New Zealand. A Greenpeace
photographer, Fernando Pereira, was
killed in the blast.

The incident provoked an .interna-
itional scandal and led to a cooling of
irelations, between New Zealand and
France and to the arrest and subse-
quent trial and imprisonment for man-
slaughter of two French intelligence
1, agents implicated in the bombing. ‘

The award was announced here to--
day by Greenpeace’s Washington of-

Lloyd Cutler, a Washington lawyer
.who represented the environmental
group in the arbitration, said that as
far as he knew this was the first time
that an international damages case
had been arbitrated by agreement be-
,tween a sovereign nation and a private
organization.

He said large awards for aggravated
damages “are usually awarded only-
when the wrongdoer’s conduct war-
rants special condemnation.”

In a telephone interview, Mr. Cutler
also said the deCision had a broader im-
portance in that “a state security unit
was held to have committed unlawful
action pnder international and Eng-
lish la '4” English law was applied be-
cause t e Rainbow Warrior was flyin

“This precedent will hold all state se-
curity and intelligence agencies to ac-
count in the future," said Mr. Cutler,
who was counsel to President Carter.

'The French Government at first
denied and later admitted responsibil-
ity for the sinking of the Greenpeace

 

vessel. France has- already paid sepa-
rate compensation of $7 million to the
New Zealand Government under a set-
tlement negotiated by the United Na-
tions Secretary General, Javier Perez
de Cuéllar. Under that settlement,
France also agreed to apologize for the
incident and to stop blocking sales of
New Zealand’s agricultural products in
the European Community.

In return, New Zealand agreed to
turn the French security agents, who
had been sentenced to 10 years in
prison, over to French custody. The
agents, Maj. Alain Mafart and Capt.
Dominique Prieur, are now in detené
tion at' a military base on-.the French is-
land of Hao in the Pacific.

‘A Great Victory’

David McTaggart, the chairman of
Greenpeace, said today’s decision “is a
great victory for those who support the
‘right of peaceful protest and abhor the
use of violence.” '

The executive director of the United
States arm of Greenpeace, Steve Saw-
yer, said, “This award will reinforce
Greenpeace’s determination to do
everything in our power to help the peo-
: ple of'the Pacific stop nuclear testing.”

The chairman of the international
tribunal "was Prof. Claude Reymond,
professor of international law at the

University of Geneva, who was ap-

pointed by the Swiss Federal Tribunal.

The other members were Sir Owen

Woodhouse, a former president of the

New Zealand cOurt of appeal, who.was
nominated by Greenpeace, and Prof.
Francois Terre of the University of

Paris, who was nominated by France.

, France has already reached a finan-
i cial settlement 'with Mr. Pereira’s
family, .but a spokesman for the
French Embassy here, Daniel La-
brosse, said the sum involved had not
been made public.

GUERMAN GVENTSADZE, the charge

translations of some of Mikhail
Gorbachov’s more important articles. They
are worth careful reading in a way that
Leonid Brezhnev’s writings did not merit
study. Unmentioned, as far as I am aware,
in Gorbachov’s otherwise well-reported
piece in Pravda , “The reality and the guar-

“Ecological security. It is not secure in
the direct meaning of the word when

when the development of atomic

“Many have suddenly begun to perceive
all that not as something abstract, but as

Big Spending for a Spent Fuel Bribe

Washington has reached rock bottom in its five-
year search for an underground site to store spent
fuel from nuclear reactors. The latest scheme, de-
vised by Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisiana,
would make Nevada the unlucky host, recompensed
with a $5 billion bribe. Congress’s other ideas being
even worse, this one deserves attention.

Fairness was a fatal flaw of the 1982 scheme
that called for a repository to be built in the West
and another site to be selected in the East. The plan
.‘seemed fine in the abstract yet became as popular
as Russian roulette as the search narrowed.

Eastern states produce most of the radioactive
'waste but wish to bury it in the West. When the site
.selectors pronounced the fine granite formations of
‘the East ideal for long-term storage, a howl went
up. Last year, John Herrington, Secretary of Ener-
‘gy, gained the Administration political relief by sus-
Tpending the search for an Eastern site. A repository
ﬁfthat must last 100,000 years fell hostage to politi-
'~eians with a horizon of two.

Mr. Herrington’s stratagem shattered the 1982
agreement. Senator Johnston has now remixed the
'bits with force majeure and a fistful of cash. He
wants Mr. Herrington to stop looking for new East-
ern sites and to focus on the three principal Western
sites — Hanford in Washington, Deaf Smith County
in Texas and Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

But the Secretary is directed to consider cost
(which would rule out Hanford) and groundwater
(which eliminates Deaf Smith, above the Ogallala
aquifer). The remaining candidate, Nevada, would
receive a colossal “incentive package” —— $50 mil-
lion a year while the site is constructed, and $100

million for each of the 50 years it accepts waste.

According to a study by Luther Carter for Re-
sources for the Future, a private research organiza-
tion, Yucca Mountain is technically promising. A
repository dug 1,000 feet below its top would still lie
high above the water table. Water, the main threat
to long-term storage, could corrode the waste canis-
ters and dissipate radiation. _

Mr. Johnston’s bill was approved last month by
the Senate Appropriations committee, and is sup-
ported by the Energy Department and the nuclear
utilities. A rival bill in the House proposes halting
all site selection during a complete review. But the
search for a spent fuel depository has limped from
fiasco to disaster for 20 years; another review will
be no crutch.

If Yucca Mountain looks adequate, the $1 billion
process of testing its rocks and groundwater needs
to begin at once. Studying several sites simulta-
neously just to spread the political burden would
waste billions. But the $100 million annual tribute to
Nevada is far too high. The inhabitants of Carlsbad,
N .M., are accepting a similar repository for nuclear
weapons waste without holding their fellow citizens
up for such ransom. They find the creation of new
jobs reward enough.

Every state with a nuclear power plant already
hosts a high-level radioactive waste dump - power
plants have to store their spent fuel elements on site
until a Federal repository is built. All would be bet-
ter off with the spent fuel stored safely under-
ground. Nevada would earn 49 salutes by accepting
the site — and spurning the bribe.‘

 

 

Let the Nuclear Industry Eat Its Own Waste

 

To the Editor:

Further on “Big Spending for a
Spent Fuel Bribe,” your editorial
(Oct. 4) on the bill introduced by
Senator Bennett Johnston of Louisi-
ana that would pay Nevada $100 mil-
lion a year for 50 years to accept an
underground site for spent fuel from
nuclear reactors:

The only way to prevent bribery in
connection with the nuclear-waste
problem is to investigate an alterna-
tive to long-term burial. The viable al-
ternative is to return the long-lived
nuclear waste to nuclear reactors to
be transmuted and burned up. This is
possible within the immutable laws of
physics and nature.

There are basically two types of
waste: (1) very long-lived transuran-
ics, such as plutonium, americium and

curium, which require hundreds of
thousands of years of storage, and (2)
long-lived fission products, such as
cesium and strontium, which need
only hundreds of years of storage.

By reprocessing spent fuel coming
from nuclear power reactors, the
transuranics can be extracted and re-
turned in the fresh fuel to the reac-
tors. Even the waste fission products
can be returned if only for storage in
the reactors for eventual decay if it is
not possible to transmute them to
short-lived waste. The Japanese are
already designing a reactor that
burns transuranic nuclear waste. So
why are we not doing this?

The official answer is that the Waste
Management Act of 1982 does not in-
clude recycling nuclear waste. There-
fore, the Department of Energy is not

required to investigate it even if it
does have the potential of solving the
problem. Another answer appears to
be that it is uneconomical to reprocess
spent fuel from reactors. That may be
true for recovering uranium and plu-
tonium as fuel; however, reprocessing
for waste management is eminently
economical for two reasons: (1) to
avoid a $5 billion bribe for geological-
age storage and (2) to avoid shutting
down 100 operating reactors, as well
as removing the obstacle to starting
up new reactors whose nuclear waste
no one wants in his backyard.

There is a crying need now to inves-
tigate the long-overdue alternative of
having the nuclear industry eat its
own waste. MEYER STEINBERG

The scientists agreed, as they have
for years, that the trees in both coun-
tries were dying for unexplained and
complex reasons, apparently a combi-
nation of man-made and natural
causes. But that was about the extent
of the agreement.

The Germans have been studying
forest problems since 1979, when silver
fir trees inexplicably began dying in
southern part of their country. The de-
cline has since been documented in
other species throughout West Germa-
ny. Americans joined the study several
years later, when it became clear that
spruce and fir trees at high elevations
in the eastern United States were suf-
fering unexplained damage. Such dam-

 

age has also been noted in the San Ber— ;

nardino mountains in California.
Exchange of Data

Since then, experts from both coun-
tries have exchanged information
regularly in scientific journals and at
conferences such as the one here on
“The Effects of Atmospheric Pollution
on Spruce and Fir Trees in the Eastern

.‘ United States and the Federal Republic
of Germany.”

At the meeting here Peter Schiitt, a
forest botanist at the University of Mu-

! nich, spoke eloquently and rather
gloomily of “Waldersterben,” or “for-
est death,” and of the myriad man-
made air pollutants that might be con-
tributing factors. Dr. Schiitt and others
believe that the destruction is being
caused by the combined effects of pol-
lutants, rather than by specific types of
pollutants acting alone.

“This pollution is caused not just by
big companies but by individuals, by

,you and me,” said Dr. Schiitt as he

i stood on a fog-shrouded slope of White-

, face Mountain, a research site in New

. York’s Adirondacks that the scientists

.visited. He said preserving the health
of forests meant that individuals must
reduce their use of substances, like
gasoline, that pollute the environment.
“And what politician wants to tell peo-
ple that?” he asked.

Bernhard Prinz, a scientist with the
Institute for Air Pollution Control of
the state of North Rhine-Westphalia,
disagreed with Dr. Schiitt. Dr. Prinz ob-
jected to Dr. Schiitt’s use of the word
“Waldersterben” as “overly dra-

l

matic,” saying that he preferred to de-
scribe what'was happening as a “forest
decline.” He called on scientists .to
work to pinpoint the causes of the for-
est malaise, and “not to throw up our
hands and say it’s too complicated.”

Theories on Causes

Dr. Prinz believes that a prime cause
of the declines is from low-altitude
ozone that is created from the burning-
of fossil fuels.

Alan Wellburn, a scientist from Lan-
caster, England, who works on an
American-financed project there, said,
his research had shown that trees‘
under stress from both natural and
man-made causes manufactured in
their leaves or needles a substance
called ethyline, which then reacted
with ozone and caused the trees to die.

Dr. Art Johnson of the University of
Pennsylvania stressed the need to look
at natural causes of forest decline:
winter stress, age, disease, insects and
wind.

Others plaCed more blame on acid
rain, largely sulfur dioxides and nitro-
gen oxides that are carried through the
atmosphere where they are trans-
formed chemically and fall to earth as
precipitation. They believe acid rain
results in the leaching of nutrients
from leaves, and that it can alter soil
chemistry to the detriment of tree
growth.

Gerard D. Hertel, program manager

 

of the Spruce-Fir Research Coopera- '

tive, a Federal research center based
in Broomall, Pa., said the diversity of
opinion was important. “We share es-
sentially the same kinds of problems in

 

Is the culprit

both countries,” said Dr. Hertel. “In-
stead of having one set of data, we have
two to compare.” Over time, he said, a
consensus will emerge,

Dr. Hertel’s office was one of several
sponsors of the conference, which in-
cluded the the University of Vermont
School of Natural Resources and De-
partment of Botany, and three major
coal producers.

Richard Kerch, a spokesman for
Consolidated Coal Company of Pitts—

burgh, said the discussions showed that :

“it is not clear by any stretch that acid
rain is causing forest decline” and that
if coal producers are required to re-
duce sulfur dioxide emissions, a main
component of acid rain, it “clearly will
not be a cure-all.”

Dr. Hertel’s office works under the
auspices of the National Acid Precipi-
tation Assessment Program, which
earlier this fall released a preliminary
report concluding that acid rain posed

MOUNT RUSHMORE NA-
TIONAL MEMORIAL, S.D. (AP) —
Five members of the environmental-
ist group Greenpeace scaled Mount
Rushmore yesterday as part of a
campaign against acid rain and were
taken into custody, officials said.

Dan Wenk, the memorial’s super-
intendent, said they would be
charged with trespassing on federal
property.

The last two activists to be re-
moved from the sculpted granite
mountainside tried to unfurl a ban-
ner that read: “We the people say no
to acid rain.” Authorities managed to
cut the ropes holding the large ban-
ner, which never was fully unfurled,
Mr. Wenk said.

“We’re trying to get our message
across,” Eileen Price of Greenpeace
said before the climbers were taken
into custody.

Ttained climbers hired by the
Pennington County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment aided National Park Service :,
workers getting the climbers off the
monument in the Black Hills near
Rapid City.

ions and findings was to be expected
because the subject of .fOrest decline
was so complex. Examination of the
problem requires the study of soils,
botany, insects and diseases, biochem-
istry, climate and air. “When you try to
understand the way a complex group of
pollutants affects an extremely com-
plex ecosystem, the problems are
multiplied many times over,” he said.

Skeptical Audubon Society Will Track Acid Rain

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF
Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 — The Na-
tional Audubon Society, one of the old-
est environmental organizations, an-
nounced today that it was monitoring
acid rain around the country because it
was dissatisfied with Government ef-
forts.

The society’s volunteers have been
collecting readings at 64 monitoring
stations since July, using litmus paper
and color-coded charts to measure the
acidity of rainfall. The data show high
levels of acidity at sites all over the
country. But Dr. Jan Beyea, a senior
scientist for the society, cautioned that
isolated readings of acidity in the early
sampling results might reflect only
local conditions. -

Eventually, the society plans to have
200 monitoring sites. Sampling results
would be verified on a random basis by
an independent laboratory. The testing
procedure for the program was set up

The Environmental Protection
Agency uses 150 monitoring stations,
but agency officials contend that their
stations provide far more accurate
analysis than those of the society.

Peter A.A. Berle, president of the
society, said the program was intended
to bring timely information about acifi-
died rain to the public to put pressure
on elected officials to take action to
deal with the problem. -

“We want those in this Administra-
tion who say acid rain is not a problem
to hear about this every time they read
the local paper,” Mr. Berle said.

 

A spokesman for the environmental
agency, when asked for comment,
said: “We look forward to any infor-
mation that might shed more light on
the causes and effects of acid rain. We
hope that their study produces the type
of statistically valid data needed to fur-
ther illuminate our understanding of
the subject.”

The spokesman, David Cohen, added,
“However, it is our understanding that
their plan would be'accurate only to a

enough for our research effort.”
Acidity is measured by the pH factor,

Mr. Berle said the monitoring pro-
gram was planned long before the pub-I
lication of a report by the Reagan Ad-f
ministration’s National Acid Precipita-;
tion Assessment Program earlier this
month. That report found that only a,
few scattered areas contained acidified
lakes and that there was little if any
immediate danger to lakes, forests,
crops, building materials and human
health from acid rain. That study has,
been criticized by a number of s'cien-
tists who said its conclusions did not
match data.

Acid rain is the name given to pollu-
tion, largely oxides of sulfur and nitro-
gen, that are transformed chemically
in the atmosphere and fall to earth as
acidic rain, snow, fog or dry particles.
Much of the pollution comes from coal-
burning power plants, many of them in

considering legislation‘that would iml
pose mandatory controls on emissions
from those plants.

The. Reagan Administration con-
tends that the scientific evidence gath-
ered so far does not justify the high
cost of such controls.

166 Lawmakers Urge Action

Today 166 members of the House of
Representatives signed a letter to the
leaders of House environmental panels

what killed the dinosaurs is the
suggestion that acid rain was the culprit.
Two geologists from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology suggest that a large
comet hitting the Earth at 65 kilometres
per second would have led to strongly acidic
rain falling all over the world.

Ronald Prinn and Bruce Fegley calculate
that the impact of an ice-rich, long-period
comet weighing 12-5 million billion kilo-
grams would shock-heat the atmosphere
enough to produce huge amounts of nitro-
gen oxides (7x10‘o molecules to be exact).
This would result, they say, in acid rain
around the world with a pH of between 0
and [.5 (Earth and Planetary Science
Letters. vol 83. p I).

If the impact of the comet were much
slower. or if the object striking the Earth
were a rocky asteroid, the strongly acid rain
would be produced only in a limited area,
and the global effect “would be relatively
unimportant”.

Other groups of researchers have
suggested that volcanoes could have
produced lethal doses of acid rain, albeit
over a much longer period—about 10 000
years. Prinn and Fegley believe their model
more closely matches the effects and
survival patterns observed at the end of the
Cretaceous 65 million years ago, when
dinosaurs and many other groups died out.

They also propose a test for their
model. Sediments. undisturbed since the
end of the Cretaceous era, might record

Councilwoman Nancy Skinner said the unanimous vote,
which came at 1:15 am, approved a measure to bar the
purchase of plastic foam products containing CFCs as of Jan.
31.

Environmentalists who led the campaign contended that
CFCs released by the breakdown of plastics are threatening
Earth’s existence by destroying the atmosphere’s layer of
ozone, which keeps ‘out'dange‘rous levels of ultraviOIet rays.

urging action this year to strengthen
the Clean Air Act. Among the provi-
sions would be “tough standards” on
. pollution that causes acid rain.

The letter, written by Representa-
tives Bruce F. Vento, Democrat of
Minnesota, and Bill Green, Republican
of Manhattan, said the lawmakers “are
deeply concerned over the threats
posed to the health and welfare of our
country by continuing air pollution.”
On the subject of acid rain, the letter
said, “Evidence mounts of increas-
ingly widespread forest and agricul-
tural damage, sterile lakes and public
health problems.”

Mr. Berle of the Audubon Society
said the data on the acidity of rainfall
given by the Administration’s report

. were often years out of date and that
the data were collected in the fall, when
acidity is generally lowest.

But Susan Roth, a spokeswoman for
the Edison Electric Institute, a trade
association of private electric utilities,

collected by Audubon volunteers “will
be reliable and legitimate. enough to
base any kind of national policy on.”

The United States is being incon.

Canadian environment officials‘
said they have been told that a U.S.

released today, will discourage any

air pollution.

They said the report of the U.S.

there is so little 'damagefrom acid

This goes against the Canadian
position and the advice of many

groups, which say that damage in

North America is already severe
and is getting worse.

For years. Canada has said that

The Justice Department’s deci-
sion, announced Friday, ends a

14 Arrested in Sales of Protected Birds’

 

 

By“PHlLIP SHABECOFF
, Special to The New YOrk Times
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 -— The
United States Fish and Wildlife Service
today arrested. 14 people and filed

, charges against 50 others in the illegal

sales of eagles, hawks, owls and other
protected birds.

The arrests and charges, which in-
volved trafficking in nine states in the
West and South, cillminated an 18-

. month undercover operation by the

service.

The birds were stuffed for mounting,
and their feathers used to make rep-
licas of Indian headdresses and other
artifacts, which were bought by com-
mercial dealers and collectors in Eu-
rope and the eastern United States, the
authorities said. They said most of the
commercial transactiOns occurred in
the area of Gallup, NM.

Those arrested, including a a Gallup'

police officer, were indicted after they
had sold birds or artifacts to under-
cover agents of the Fish and Wildlife
Service, an arm of the Interior Depart-
ment. Several of those arrested were
Native Americans, ‘ department offi-
cials said. '

“Today’s action serves notice on
those who would destroy our natural
heritage that they will be brought to
justice for their crimes,” Mr. Hodel
said at a news conference here.
1“Sooner or later, violators will start
getting the message that if they poach
wildlife, they are going to be appre-
hended.”

The service said that those caught in
the undercover operation were mem-
bers of “a loose ring of traffickers in
protected birds, including bald and
golden eagles, falcons, hawks,\owls and
several species of songbirds. The
charges stemmed from the killing of
”600 birds, the authorities said.

Craig Bavin, chief of enforcement for
the Fish and Wildlife Service, noted
that the number of protected birds in-
volved in this casewas only a tiny frac-
tion of the wildlife illegally killed in this

 

country for commercial purposes. He _

THE WALL STREET JOURNﬂ
OCTOBER" 15. 1987

 

Some Indian Hunters
Come Under F ire;

Do They Overkill?

Tribal Rights Permit Them
To Ignore State Limits;
Many Bull’s-Eyes in Court <»

 

 

By KEN SLOCUM
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

MIAMI—In the nighttime blackness of a
South Florida swamp, a man fired a pistol
at two glowing, green eyes, killing a lion-
sized animal. Last week, almost four years
later, both the federal government and,
Florida gave up efforts to prosecute a;
Seminole Indian chief on charges of killing
a Florida panther, one of the world’s most
endangered animals. '

In the little Idaho town of Kamiah a few
days ago, anti-Indian anger erupted after a
Nez Perce Indian, apparently within his le-
gal rights, shot a bighorn ram considered a
community pet.

And in Wisconsin, complaining sports-
men persuaded a congressman to intro-
duce a bill that would revoke Chip wa
tribal hunting rights bestowed by tr ty
150 years ago. .

From Florida to Washington state, Indi-'
ans’ broad hunting rights are under fire.
One reason: Indians are making bold new
court claims to their rights under old trea-
ties. In addition, many people consider In-
dian hunting privileges out of step with the
popular trend toward conservation.

Many Strong Feelings

Terming hunting rights “a volatile issue
in many states,” ‘ Thomas Dougherty,

Rocky Mountain regional executive for the; gotiate d a temporary agreement under

National Wildlife Federation, a sports-
men’s group, ”comments, “What we’re

hearing from sportsmen’s groups and affil- ‘

iates is that with many game populations
bouncing back as a result of sportsmen’s
money and efforts, they have strong feel-
ings about uncontrolled harvest.”

Apart from sportsmen, few people know '

that many tribes’ hunting rights extend far
beyond reservations to ancestral hunting
grounds. There the Indians often are sub-
ject only to tribal rules and can, ignore
state hunting seasons and bag limits.

In central Idaho, the reservation for
some 3,000 Nez Perce Indians spreads
across about 150,000 acres of good deer,
moose and bighorn-sheep country. But
their ancestral hunting grounds to which
they have treaty hunting rights, now
mostly national forests, sweep westward
into Washington and Oregon. Similarly, a
1983 decision by a federal appeals court
gave six bands totaling some 9,000 Chip-
pewas hunting rights on four million acres,
roughly the northern third of Wisconsin.

Liberal Privileges
Compared with regular hunting restric-
tions, Indians’ privileges on off-reservation

ancestral hunting grounds often‘ are ex—
tremely liberal. The Nez Perce in Idaho

recognize no bag limits or seasons. Charles
Hayes, a member of the tribal executive
committee, says that although they can le-
gally hunt year-round, “the majority fol-

low the pattern set by ancestors. Our an- s

cestors didn‘t hunt in the dead of winter or
when animals were carrying young.”

Even so. Indian practice diverges [
sharply from typical fall hunting seasons,
which emphasize “fair chase”-wildlife
gets a sporting chance. In contrast, Indi-
ans and non-Indians agree, tribes hunt for
meat, not recreation, and the difference is
reflected in their hunting techniques. One
such method: hunting late in the year
when winter storms have driven deer,
moose and elk down from the mountains:
into large groups in the valleys.

Some Indians’ hunting tactics consid-
ered “biologically unsound” are eSpecially
criticized. “They kill [elk l cows with calves
by their side in June and July, and there’s
no rule against it,” says Dwight Kilgore,
an Idaho Fish and Game officer in the Nez
Perce area.

Similarly, Wisconsin’s regular deer sea-
son runs nine days, with the limit gener-
ally one deer and, in a few areas, two. The
Chippewas, negotiating with the state,
agreed to a four-month season, Septem-'
ber through December. The Chippewa
bands and the state also set the size of
their deer harvest, but within that share
Indians haven’t any individual limits, and
their spokesmen concede that some shoot
20 to 30 deer a season. -

Some Indians hunt all four months but
supply venison to others in the bands, says
James J annetta, an attorney for the Chip-
pewas. He scoffs at the impact on wildlife.

 

“We’re talking about the rights of a com-
munity of a few hundred Indian hunters
compared with hundreds of thousands of
others,” he says. “The Indian harvest in
Wisconsin is less than the road kill.”
However, George Meyer, enforcement

administrator for the Wisconsin Depart-
‘ ment of Natural Resources, notes, “The

courts even ruled the Indians could sell
game and fish to the public.” The state ne-

which Indians would confine wildlife com-
merce to bartering within the tribes.
The Indian harvest of game, often un-
measured, perplexes state officials who set
seasons according to game populations as

estimated by aerial surveys and other.

methods. Idaho’s Nez Perce don’t compile
any game-kill figures, and “we have no
way to know what’s taken by Indians,”

says Frank Nesmith, chief of law enforce- ,

ment for Fish and Game. “If there’s a

strong harvest by Indians, we come up ‘
with shorter seasons and less permits for .

nonolndians.”

The bighorn killed by a Nez Perce re—
cently near Kamiah was on private land
within the reservation. The ram had taken
a liking to the rocky slopes around the
lumbering town, and the rare animal had
become a local attraction. “What upset me
most was that it was an opportunity for
people to see a bighorn sheep, and now
it’s lost forever,” says Richard Bovey, a
state fire warden whose home looked out
on the ram’s favorite territory. “Under the
treaty, the Indian had the right to do it.
But having the right and doing right are
two different things.” Under Idaho law,
only two bighorn rams are permitted in a
hunter’s lifetime.

 

A Move in Congress

In Wisconsin, treaties giving Indians
special hunting rights are under attack.
Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. intro-
duced a bill in Congress last July stating,
“Any off-reservation usufructuary right to
hunt, fish and gather granted to any Indian
tribe by any treaty, law or executive order
which may be exercised in the State of
Wisconsin is hereby abrogated.” The Re-
publican congressman says he seeks to ab-
rogate “expanded rights handed down by
federal court.”

Protect Americans’ Rights and Re-
sources, a Wisconsin-based organization
that claims affiliates in 15 states, opposes
Indian treaties generally. “We want trea-
ties abrogated because they are outdated
and have been replaced by new opportuni—
ties and expensive programs to take care
of needy Indians and non-Indians alike,”
says Larry Greschner, its executive direc-
tor. “We don’t think the Indian should en-
joy full benefits of citizenship and then
claim to be a sovereign nation.”

In Washington state, tribal victories in
fishing cases have prompted the state to
try negotiating to get Indians to restrict
their hunting seasons voluntarily. “We said
we know you have the right to hunt on fed-
eral lands, but if you are willing to restrict
hunting to biologically sound times and
manner, we won’t challenge your right to
hunt on state lands,” says Robert Rasmus-
sen, Indian affairs administrator for the
Department of Wildlife. Last season, five
of the 20 tribes agreed.

Complex Litigation

The Florida panther case illustrates the
complexity of such litigation. Bruce Ro-
gow. attorney for Seminole Chief James
Billie and a Nova University law professor,
conceded that his client killed the big cat
in December 1983. The case was thrown

: out of state court in 1985 for lack of juris—

diction but was reinstated in 1986.

This year, when the Justice Department
prosecuted Chief Billie, Mr. Rogow argued
that “the US. Supreme Court has never
held that the federal endangered-species
act applies to Indian reservations.” He
also contended that the endangered status
applied to only one species, that there are
variations of the panther in Florida and
that which one the dead panther belonged
to isn’t known. After a federal-court mis-
trial due to a hung jury, at state-court jury
acquitted Chief Billie on a similar charge
this month. “It’s clear Indians do have dif-
ferent privileges,” Mr. Rogow says.

Some experts call litigating Indian
cases a losing game. Says James Vaught,
chief of law enforcement for New Mexico
Game and Fish, “We’ve been to the US.

- Supreme Court twice, been whipped both

times and now we’re sitting on the bench
saying, ‘If you want to argue with those In-
dians, more power to you.’ ”

 




The Wolf, Long Gone, Returns to the U .S.

 

Ecologists welcome the
unusual comeback, but
ranchers are alarmed.

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

 

HE primal howl of the wolf, once

heard from central Mexico to the;

Arctic, has been almost completely
silenced south of the Canadian bor-

der in the few centuries since Europeans ar-

rived on this continent.

Slaughtered by the thousands by ranchers
seeking to protect their herds, by hunters
competing with the predators for game ani—
mals and by settlers who saw them as the in-
carnation of a dark and threatening wilder-

tinction in the United States by the early part
of this century.

But recently there have been signs that the
wolf is returning to the wilds in the United
States, although the return is already threat-
ened by politics and economics. Protected by
the Endangered Species Act and increasingly
embraced by a public whose fear and hatred
are gradually changing to admiration and
sympathy, scattered packs of gray wolves
are beginning to venture inside the nation’s
northern border. Some of them are staying.

“We are seeing what we thought was al-
most impossible happen —- we are seeing the
return of a large predatory animal to a sig-
nificant part of its former range from which
it had been previously wiped out,” said Ron

species office of the Federal Fish and Wild-
life Service.

The Federal Government has devised sev-
eral programs to reintroduce wolves in areas

where they had vanished. It is taking these ‘

actions under provisions of the endangered
species law that seek torestore species near-
ing extinction. Earlier this month, the wild-
life service turned four mating pairs of red
wolves loose in North Carolina. The red wolf,
Canis rufus, a smaller relative of the pre-
dominant gray wolf, Canis lupus, had been
reduced to a total population of 85, all in cap-
tivity before the program started.

“This is the first time a native species ex-
tinct in the wild has been returned to the wild
from a captive breeding population,” said
Donald Pfitzer, the wildlife service’s assist-
ant regional director in the Southeast.

The service has also prepared an ambi—
tious experimental program to reintroduce
Rocky Mountain timberwolves, a subspecies
of the gray wolf, into the northern Rockies.
The plan calls for transplanting wolf packs
into Montana, Idaho and Yellowstone Na-
tional Park in Wyoming. '

The Yellowstone recovery plan is strongly
supported by the director of the National
Park Service, William Penn Mott Jr.

“We do not have a right to eliminate these.
animals from the web of life,” Mr. Mott said.
“Future generations have a right to go to
Yellowstone and hear those magnificent ani-
mals howl.”

B‘ut opponents in Congress, apparently re-I
flecting the views of cattle and sheep raisers.
and hunters, have blocked the plan. It has
been put on. the shelf by Frank Dunkle, direc~
tor of the wildlife service, after vigorous pro-
tests by members of Wyoming’s Congres-
sional delegation: Senators Alan K. Simpson
and Malcolm Walfop and Representative
Dick Cheney, all Republicans.

Mr. Simpson said in a telephone interview

Tl” /\’l"\V YORK 743115.“). TL»! SHAY, ()(TTUBI‘IR 27, 19.“

that his opposition to immediately
reintroducing wolves in Yellowstone
was in response to pressure from his
constituents, who believe the wolves
would be “a very serious threat to the
livestock industry.”

He said that hunting was an impor—
tant part of Wyoming’s economy, and
that not enough information had been
gathered on what effect the wolves
would have on moose, elk and other
game outside Yellowstone. No hunt-

ness, wolves were brought to the brink of ex- 3 ing is allowed in the park.

Mr. Simpson said he was also con-
cerned that the Park Service might
close off large sections of Yellow-
stone to protect wolves, just as it did
to protect endangered grizzly bears.
He insisted that more information
and public debate were needed before
allowing wolves back.

Signs of Natural Return

Mr. Dunkle of the wildlife service
said one reason the wolf recovery
program was put on hold is because
of signs that wolves are “drifting
naturally” into northern states from
Canada. He said much more needs to
be learned about “whether the wolves

' could be controlled and whether we

Nowak, a mammologist in the endangered gc g a pe p pe y

“The director of the National Park
Service said he would like Yellow-
stone Park tohave wolves, but I sug-
gest that now is not the time and I
would not recommend it,” he said.

Mr. Mott, the park service’s direc-
tor, said he believed that proper man-

‘ agement could solve any problems

caused by re-entry of the wolf into
Yellowstone. For example, radio col-
lars fitted on wolves could keep track
of them and could also be used to in-
ject harmless tranquilizers to re-
strain wolves that venture too far
from the park. Compensation could
be paid for livestock destroyed out-
side the park, he said.

But ranchers in the area seem to be
adamantly opposed to the wolf under
any circumstances.

‘We Are Not a Wild Area’ '

“You can’t ‘plunk these animals
down in an area where they can’t

_ adapt,”'insisted Joe T. Helle, who has
5,000 sheep on his ranch 50 miles

north of Yellowstone near Dillon,
Mont. “We are not a wild area out
here. The wolf plan introduces a large
predator who eats prey every day.
But the wildlife prey base is not there.
The prey base is now livestock.”

Mr. Helle said ranchers strongly
opposed the idea of being compen-
sated for cattle and sheep killed by
wolves. “We are not in the business of
growing livestock for predators,” he
said. He also complained that even if
ranchers caught wolves attacking
their livestock, they could not shoot
them because of the endangered spe-
cies law.

In Minnesota, wolves and the live-
stock industry appear to be co-exist-
ing reasonably well. There are 1,200

wolves in northern Minnesota, by far.
the largest wolf population in this;
country outside of Alaska, and they
are listed as a threatened rather than:
an endangered species in that state.

After long legal and political bat~.
ties, the state introduced a programl
that encourages the wolf populatiom
but also instituted a control program.
under which state hunters kill wolves;
that attack livestock. Ranchers who.
lose stock are compensated by the:
state.

L. David Mech, a biologist at the:
wildlife service who is an expert on.
wolves, said the Minnesota experi-.
ence had raised his hopes that wolves.

mals such as deer, elk and moose.

“For many people the howl of the
wolf is no longer fearsome; it has be-
come a symbol of wild nature,” said
Dan Smith, a spokesman for Defend-
ers of Wildlife, a conservation group
that is trying to protect the wolf.

But Mr. Smith is deeply concerned
about receht events. “Except for a
few hopeful developments,” he said,
“the wolves are under siege again.
The intrusion of politics into the en-
dangered species recovery process is
incredible right now. The future of
wolves is being decided in the politi-
calarena.” .

In addition to the 1,200 wolves in
Minnesota and 8 now in the wild in
North Carolina, the wildlife service
estimates that there are about 20
wolves each in Wisconsin, Northern
Michigan, Isle Royale in Lake Superi-
or, and perhaps 20 to 35 in Montana.

There have been sightings of about
a half dozen and reports of scattered
wolves in Oregon, Washington, Wyo-
ming, North and South Dakota, New
Mexico, Arizona and Texas. The Mex-
ican wolf, a subspecies of the gray
wolf, is virtually extinct in the wild

. except for a handful of animals in the
, Southwest and Mexico.

Alaska has from 4,000 to 8,000

wolves. They are not an endangered
' species in Alaska, and state has been

people.

He noted that in Minnesota wolves
mainly stay in the wilderness and
only rarely wander on to rangeland to
attack cattle.

“There has been a lot of oppor-
tunity for wolves to kill livestock but
they haven’t,” he said. “They live on
wild prey.”

Dr. Mech said he was also encour-

‘ aged by changing public attitudes.

Recent opinion polls in Minnesota,
Wyoming and MOntana indicate that
most residents support efforts to
reintroduce wolves into their states.

- Opposition was expressed mostly by

stockmen and people associated with
hunting.
Myth of Evil Creature

Judging by the polls, the public no
longer views the evil creature der
picted in such tales as “Little Red
Riding Hood.” In fact, Dr. Mech said,
the savage, threatening wolf was
never more than a myth. He said

i there is no recorded instance of a non-

rabid wolf attacking and killing a
human being in this country.

Another myth, Dr. Mech said, is the
increasingly popular view of the wolf
as an amiable creature that befriends
human beings and lives largely on
mice and other small animals. This
view has been put forward in such
works as , Farley Mowat’s book
“Never Cry Wolf” and in the movie
based on it.

In reality, he said, wolves are shy
creatures that avoid human contact
and live largely on large hoofed ani-

shooting them from aircraft in recent
years to reduce their taking of moose,
elk, caribou and other large game
animals valued by hunters.

A State of Combat

In Canada there are still 25,000 to
30,000 wolves. The reason they were
not eliminated in Canada as they
were in this country, according to Mr.
Nowak of the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice, is that far less of that country is
suitable for ranching. “The intensity
of combat against the wolf is always
most intense when people’s livestock
is at stake,” he said.

The provincial government of Brit-

ish Columbia has encouraged the
hunting of wolves to reduce losses of
game animals. The practice has been
bitterly criticized by conservationists
in Canada and the United States be-
cause of fears that the practice will
slow or halt the southward migration
of wolves into the United States. But
last Friday British Columbia’s Minis-
try of Environment and Parks an-
nounced it would close the wolf hunt-
ing and trapping seasons near the
United States after “determining that
no more wolves could safely be re-
moved from wolf packs in the areas
without endangering wolf recovery
efforts south of the border.”
' The country with the most wolves
today is the Soviet Union, with an esti-
mated 50,000 to 100,000. They have
been largely wiped out in Western
Europe, except for about 200 in Italy,
800 in Spain, 100 in Portugal and 200
in Finland. There are also believed to
be a few hundred each in Eastern Eu-
rope and India. Several thousand
may roam northern China.

Saving Wolves by Soothing 'Ran'Ch'ers

By TOM BLOOD

In the early 19005, more than 100 wolves
lived in Yellowstone National Park. But
park officials considered the wolf a men-
ace to more attractive game, and mainly
through their efforts the Yellowstone wolf
was extinct by 1926.

Today, recognizing the important role
of predators in maintaining the ecological
balance, wildlife groups in Montana and
Wyoming are pushing for the restoration of

wolves in the park. A plan written under'

the supervision of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife
Service proposes that gray wolves be taken
from either Canada or Minnesota and re-
leased in Yellowstone. If the plan goes
through, wolves will be federally protected
and it will be illegal for ranchers to kill
them. Naturally, ranchers near the park
fear livestock losses, and their opposition
has put the plan on hold.

To counter rancher opposition, some en-
vironmental groups are recommending a
federally funded compensation program to
pay for animals killed by wolves. Their
model is a state-funded program in Minne-
sota that pays ranchers whose livestock is
killed by any of the 1,200 or so timber
wolves in the state.

But one conservation group, Defenders
of Wildlife, is more enterprising—it is
starting a compensation program of its
own, and the funding source is private indi-
viduals. “A lot of influential people were
telling us a compensation program was the
key to the acceptance of wolves in Yellow-
stone,” explains the group’s Northern
Rockies representative, Hank Fischer.
“Dealing with the government can take

forever, so we decided to start our own."
The group’s board is expected to approve
the program in December.

Members of the organization are not
kidding themselves that their program will
change ranchers’ minds about wolves. “We
don’t believe our compensation program
can offer incentives to make wolves more
desirable, but it can make them more neu-
tral," says Mr. Fischer.

. The conservation group is trying to get
government help in implementing the pro-
gram. Under the Defenders’ proposal, the
AgricultUre Department would verify that
ranch animals were killed by wolves, and
the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service would esti-
mate damages and hand out the checks.
Dale Harms, a biologist with the Fish &
Wildlife Service, says his agency is in fa-
vor of the program, and Mr. Fischer says
the Agriculture Department has expressed
a willingness to cooperate.

Defenders hopes to have enough money
to cover Yellowstone wolves for 10 years
after they are reintroduced. Using data on
wolf dynamics in Minnesota and Canada,
Defenders figures it will pay out an aver-
age of $1,000 in each of the first five years
wolves are in Yellowstone, and about
$3,000 in each of the second five years.

These numbers may be understated.
Last summer, seven wolves raided live-
stock herds on three northern Montana
ranches, several hundred miles from Yel-
lowstone. The value of livestock killed by
the wolves, which were not part of a rein-
troduction program? A total of $3,149.
However, Defenders was able to raise pri-
vate money to pay these ranchers in a

fundraising effort that took only two
days.

Defenders’ proposed compensation pro-
gram is designed to cover ranchers only
until Yellowstone wolf populations are big
enough to sustain themselves without the
endangered status. Once the Fish & Wild-
life Service delists the animal, ranchers
will be able to shoot trouble-making wolves
without breaking the law, and a compensa-
tion program will no longer be needed.

At the very least, this private approach
would be more cost-effective than a public
program would be. Government adminis-
trators have an incentive to use up their
budget; if they don’t, it may be reduced
the following year.

With a private compensation program,
the responsibility would be shouldered not
by the taxpayers but by the people who
want wolves in Yellowstone. And the group
would have an economic stake in keeping
down the number of livestock killings.

Defenders is not alone in instituting a
private compensation scheme to protect
wildlife. In 1985, the Great Bear Founda-
tion started paying ranchers for livestock
killed by grizzlies in Montana’s Rocky
Mountains. Like Defenders, The Great
Bear Foundation gets its money from pri-
vate sources, and it has paid ranchers
about $7,000 in the past three years.

Such imaginative approaches offer
some hope that the wolf may be reintro-
duced into Yellowstone yet. '

plan while serving as a research fellozr
with the Political Economy Research Cen-
ter in Bozeman, Mont.

Australia

A jump ahead

OOKING back, one might think that
Benjamin Franklin’s idea of having the
turkey as America’s national symbol was not
a good one. It is difﬁcult to keep your dignity
when the rest of the world associates your
country with dinner—time. lf kangaroo harv
vesting were to take off, this would be a
problem facing Australia.

Mr Gordon Grigg of the University of
Sydney is advocating that commercial culv
tivation of kangaroos should be taken more
seriously. His ideas stem from a concern for
the environment. The marginal, semivarid
regions of Australia are not well served by
the ranching of sheep. Hard hooves wear
down the plants, close cropping damages

them, and the big ﬂat teeth of the sheep
crush their seeds so that they are not spread

in droppings.

To stop the environmental damage,
which with over—grazing will eventually make
a real desert of the place, this form of live
stock should be removed. For the sake of the
landowners, it should be replaced by some
thing else. Soft—footed, ﬁne‘toothed kanga’
roos that nibble at plants rather than crunch
them up would seem to ﬁt the bill. They do
not wear paths through the vegetation, and
they spread seeds around efﬁciently.

Heart of the matter

Mr Grigg’s plan is not to farm kangaroos
(they tend to jump out), but to let them
roam free and harvest them in a controlled
way. Landowners would be given a quota,
which would be strictly enforced, telling
them how many they could kill. Probably as
many would be killed as now, but fewer
would be killed illegally. At the moment,
kangaroos are thought of as pests in rural
Australia, and commonly killed despite their
protected status. If they were seen as valuv
able commodities, the farmers would have
an interest in protecting them.

For kangaroos to be valuable, though,
there must be a market for them. At present
kangaroos killed in ofﬁcial culls tend to be—
come leather and pet food. They have potent
tial as food for humans. With only 1% fat, as
opposed to mutton’s 40%, and tasting like

ROME (lb—Environmentalists

frighten away wildlife and disrupt

About 5,000 banner-waving ac-

tion. “We want to transform the

beginning of a new massacre.”

He said that 100 million animals

There is a vast potential market in Asia,

NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES

Whereas the 90-million—acre National Wildlife Reﬁtge System constitutes the only assemblage
of national lands set aside principally to protect, beneﬁt, and enhance wildlife; and

Whereas National Wildlife Refuges were created as inviolate sanctuaries for wild animals,
to provide true reﬁtge; and

Whereas without knowledge and consent of the public, National Wildlife Refuges often have
become areas where public hunting and trapping are allowed; to wit, hundreds of thousands
of animals of more than one hundred species are killed and wounded in sport hunting and sport
or commercial trapping programs each year on National Wildlife Reﬁtges causing untold suﬂer—
ing; and

Whereas National Reﬁtges are administered by the United States government with public
tax dollars; and

Whereas sport hunting and sport or commercial trapping of wildlife are inconsistent with
providing inviolate sanctuaries, and the destruction of wildlife for human sport, recreation, or
commerce cannot be justiﬁed on the one set of lands established specifically to beneﬁt wildlife;
therefore:

We, the undersigned, support legislation to reaﬁirm that National Wildlife Refuges are in-
violate sanctuaries for wildlife and to end the killing of wildlife for sport and commercial pur-
poses on these Refuges; and we urge our congressional representatives and senators to do likewise.

THE ECONOMIST OCTOBER 17 1987

 

W0 hundred years ago, the framers

of the American constitution put the
value of a black American at threerﬁfths
of a white one. What will be the value of
an Amazonian Indian under the constitu—
tion now being framed by Brazil’s constit’
uent assembly?

Low. Existing Brazilian law deems the
country’s 220,000 Indians “relatively in—
capable”, putting them on a par with ad—
olescent children, making them wardsof
the state and putting their interests in the
hands of the National Indian Foundation,
FUNAI. One draft of the new constitution
lowers their status to “absolutely
incapable”.

Most Brazilian Indians live in
wretched conditions in the Amazon bar
sin. FUNAI has been ineffectual in setting
aside new reserves for them. As part of the
Calha Norte (northern watershed) pro—
gramme, the Brazilian army refuses to alv
low Indian reserves within 150 kilometres
of any border. The programme aims to
bring law and order to the wilder reaches
of the Amazon and stop illegal gold—pan—
ning and drug—smuggling. In the northern
region of Roraima, ﬁghts between
Yanomani Indians and miners recently
claimed seven lives. The government has
asked the miners to leave the Yanomani
reserve, but the wellrarmed miners refuse
to budge: they say the army approves of
their presence.

By establishing itself all along the un
tamed border, the army hopes to encourr
age immigration from the rest of the coun—
try. In the states of Acre and Rondonia, in

An Amazonian tragedy

the west of the Amazon basin, the hope is
being realised. A loan from the Inter;
American Development Bank (IDB) is pay’
ing for the surfacing of the region’s only
highway, the BR 364. The section in Ron—
donia is already surfaced, and the popula
tion of the region is growing quickly, as
poor people from the rest of the country
begin to ﬂock in. Some are already passing
through Rondonia and on to Acre.

From the environmental point of view,
development can be a disaster. Satellite
photographs show huge swathes of rain
forest being cleared for ranching and min—
ing. Some projections suggest that the en—
tire state of Rondonia will be bare of forv
est by 1992.

In 1985 the World Bank cut off ﬁnance
for a more southerly section of the BR 364
because Brazil was not fulﬁlling undertak—
ings to create Indian reserves and to limit
the damage to the forest. The Brazilians
quickly conformed, and the money was re—
stored. Something similar is happening
now. The $58.5m loan from the IDB in—
cluded $10m for environmental protec—
tion and the creation of Indian reserves.
So far, there is little evidence of either of
these happening.

The clearance of the forest in Acre and
Rondonia does not affect just the way of
life of the 6,000 Indians in the region. It
also threatens the livelihoods of the indigv
enous rubbervtappers. Their union, led by
Mr Chico Mendes, together with the
Union of Indian Nations, has formed an
organisation called the Amazonian Alliv
ance for the Peoples of the Forest to resist

the damage brought by the highway.

One of its proposals is the creation of
extractive reserves. These would be re—
gions of forest set aside for the harvesting
of rubber and brazil nuts. They would
ring the areas set aside for the Indians,
providing both a cordon sanitaire and a
place to resettle the rubberrtappers who
now live within Indian regions. Some
studies suggest that this sort of land use is
more productive than ranching, particu—
larly if pigs and chickens are reintroduced
into the forest.

The state government of Acre and the
federal development agency, INCRA, have
welcomed the proposals. In general,
though, environmentalists are regarded
with suspicion in entrepreneurial Brazil.
There are strong feelings that they are
used by the country’s enemies to shackle
its economic growth. A conservative
newspaper recently linked environmental
groups and missionaries with drugvsmug—
glers and South—East Asian tin—mining
companies. The National Bishops’ Counv
cil says the story was planted by Brazil’s
own tin—miners.

biosphere”. Being partial to this kind of
thing, Feedback went along.

The meeting was shambolic, but some of -

the individual turns were classics. Take
Arthur Westing, who works for the
Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute and writes books, on all sorts of
disasters. from his bolthole in Sweden. He
reckons that for the world to live in the style
to which he has become accustomed with-
out beating up the biosphere, its population
must be cut from the present 5 billion to 2
l)illi()ri.

He produced the astounding statistic that
human beings now make up more than 20
per cent of the “terrestrial biomass”. To
bring down numbers he wants all five
billion of us to be issued with permits
allowing us to produce however many-
children people like him deem appropriate.
In keeping with the current winds of
free-marketeering, he says people should be
allowed to buy and sell these permits-—
rather like the EEC’s milk quotas. E]

REED BRYSON, from the University of
Wisconsin, had another line. He said
that, if the world’s population grows
according to UN predictions, we will run
out of sunlight around the middle of the
next century.

On the basis of calculations about how
many calories an individual consumes each

 

day, he reckons that sufficient sunlight
reaches the surface of the Earth to sustain
5-56 people per hectare. The current world
population density is 3 people per hectare.
When the global population hits 9 billion
people, we run out of sunlight.

He also had a limit, based on water
consumption, which the world hit at 6-7
billion people. But, to be honest. Feedback
got lost at this point. C]

AFTER this kind of reasoning. the
apocalyptic utterings of Teddy Gold-
smith, the editor of The Ecologist, seem
almost refreshing. He says: “We are rapidly
reaching the end.” Economic development
is leading us down the path to assured
destruction.

By the end of the century, a billion

people will be dying of starvation as the
Indian. subcontinent joins Africa in
ecological catastrophe. The “green
revolution” is of no consequence. And he
has no truck with the nirvana of
“sustainable development”.
. This sort of thinking takes him in alarm-
ing (some might say extremely right-wing)
directions. Conventional wisdom has it
that the poor starve in a world awash with
food surpluses because they are too poor to
buy the food. This suggests that what is
needed is faster economic development in
Africa. This Goldsmith calls a “global posi-
tive feedback” in the cycle 0 ecological
disaster.

becomes, "or so it seems, a treason against
the planet.

Goldsmith himself seems to be playing as
safe as possible. He lives most of the year in
New Zealand. D

HE CONFERENCE‘sg

more cerebral tend- '

ency was headed by Martin ,

Holdgate. the chief scientist

at Britain‘s Department of the Environ— :
merit and usually referred to as “very j
bright”. He is wedded to the art of the f
possible and to making economists and j
politicians see the economic sense of ,
conservation. He calls this ecological
economics. “Sustainable development” is
the lifeblood of his case in the corridors of
Whitehall. He thinks the Goldsmith mob
are dangerous cranks. {3

THAT IS not to say that Holdgate
dislikes wild theories. He apparently
has a bunch up his sleeve. Both he and
William Clarke, an excitable character who
was until recently with the International
Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in
Vienna, hold to the' view that most
ecological developments are abrupt and
totally unexpected, especially by know-all
ecologists. The two men promised at the
meeting to exchange short-lists of their own
hunches for the next surprise that would
rock the world. Perhaps this is a game we
could all join in.

Choking in the Amazon

 

Sue Branford visits the lungs of the world

 

 

Sue Branlord’f‘hncha" A-d

 

Saw point: who will stand up and champion the Brazilian rainfarests?

“ lVE ME urban smog any day,” l
G thought, as l coughed and
wheezed, with my eyes smarting.
for six hours on a bus along a road in Acre,
until recently one of the most isolated areas
of Brazil. It seemed ironic to be coughing in
the Amazon. the region that many ecolo—
gists claim to be the “lungs of the world”.
It was late August, neanng the end of the
dry season, and on either Side of the road
the forest was burning. belching up clouds
of smoke. Though Acre is in the heart of the
tropics. the Sun was a distant red globe,
trying in vain to break through the screen of
smoke. Charred brazil-nut trees, protected

by federal law, stood like lonely sentinels
amid the destruction. But even their respite
will be brief: deprived of the support of the
surrounding forest, the trees will stop
producing nuts and slowly die.

After the horror of the bus journey. it was
a relief to reach the small town of Brasileia.
on the border with Bolivia, and to be taken
the next day by a rubber-tapper into the
cool of the forest. As I panted to keep up
with him, the tapper identiﬁed the trees: the
tall seringueira (rubber tree). easily recog-
nisable by the numerous cuts made by
4 tappers to collect the latex; the massive

brazil nut, towering over the rest of the
forest with its distinctive canopy; the
copaiba, the sap of which is used in many
herbal remedies; and many others.

Arriving unexpectedly at an isolated hut
in the forest, we were welcomed by a
friendly family of rubber-tappers, who ﬁrst
1 provided a tasty lunch of rice, beans and
paca (a native rodent) and then showed me
. how the latex was transformed into a ball of
‘ rubber by being turned on a spit over a ﬁre.
The tappers, who get up at two or three in
. the morning to travel down their “roa ” to
cut their trees, and then repeat the journey
. in the early afternoon to collect the latex.
regularly walk 30 kilometres a day.

Even here. however. the threat of
destruction loomed. The 14 families in this
scattered community (which, by chance, I
. found out was the birthplace of Chico
Mendes, the internationally-renowned
' leader of the rubber-tappers) have been
threatened by eviction, to free the area for
a scheme of land development which will
‘ settle farmers from southern Brazil and
will. inevitably, lead to the destruction of
the forest.

 

 

 

(“But some of these families have been
living on the same plot for 30 years,” I later
remonstrated in Rio Branco, the state capi-
tal, with Odelia Samapaia, the head of the
state’s colonisation programme. This gives
them rights under Brazilian law.” “But
none of the families challenged, in court,
the landowner’s claims,” she replied. “But
they’re illiterate rubber-tappers. How can
they?” I asked.)

The land development schemes—and
the big cattle ranches which move in
simultaneously—are not the only threat to
the rubber-tappers. Causing almost as
much harm to the environment are the
timber merchants, mainly from the south
of Brazil. They move in as soon as the ﬁrst
earth road is opened up and bully the small
farmers and rubber-tappers into selling the
hard timber on their land. They buy up, not
only mahogany (which they are still permit-
ted to do under Brazilian law), but also,
whenever they can get away with it, brazil—
nut and rubber trees, both of which are
protected.

Standing by a huge brazil-nut trunk, the
manager of a timber company in Brasileia
told me that he paid 800 cruzados (£10) per
cubic metre for mahogany, when he under-
took the felling and transport costs. The
timber, he said, was then sawn into planks
(so that it could be considered a
“processed” product and exported under
Brazilian law) and then sent by road to
ports in south Brazil to be shipped to the
US and Europe.

Lorries bearing huge mahogany trunks,
sometimes at least a metre and a half
across, travel along the roads, day and
night. A local newspaper counted 93 lorries
bearing hard timber travelling into Rio
Branco during a three-hour period one day
last month. Despite all the campaigns by
conservationists all over the world, the rape
of the Amazon has intensiﬁed.

International trading companies handle
most of the exports: Xerox Trading
Corporation in the US, for example, has
just signed a one-million-dollar contract for
hardwood exports with a Sao Paulo-based
company, Plancap. Britain is an important

market, importing about £30 million worth
of Brazilian mahogany a year. The proﬁts
seem staggering: in Britain a table and six
chairs, containing about one and a half
cubic metres of timber and made from
Brazilian mahogany (Swetania macro-
phylla)—“the only authentic mahogany”,

New Scientist 8 October 1987

*uaurwum lav-ma. . . n

the London-based World of Mahogany
assured me—fetch about £1000.

Despite the difﬁculties, Chico Mendes
and the other leaders of the rubber~tappers
are_ surprisingly sanguine. Sitting in the
main square in Brasileia, they said that over
the past few years their movement had
made enormous strides. For the ﬁrst time.
they were working closely with Indian
groups, their traditional enemies. They had
developed new forms of resistance—par—
ticularly the empate, a kind of occupation,
in Wthh men, women and children from
rubber-tapping communities surround the
men felling the trees and, by means of both
appeals for solidarity and intimidation.
convince them to stop.

Through constant harassment, the
rubber-tappers have even persuaded some
big cattle companies, notably Bordon, a big
exporter of beef to Britain, to sell up and

move out of the region. Destruction of the
forest, the tappers said, was beginning to
slow down.

Mendes also said that, with the help of
foreign ecologists and anthropologists, they
had persuaded the Inter-American Devel-
opment Bank to threaten to suspend a
$50-million loan, intended to help fund the
asphalting of the main road into the region,
unless far tougher measures were taken to
protect the Indians and the forest.

But can this fragile alliance of rubber-
tappers, Indians and ecologists really take
on the international timber trade and the
cattle companies? Mendes himself has
received death threats, and a close adviser
to the Acre administration told me that the
governor himself, who is trying, belatedly.
to help stem the predatory destruction of
the forest, has been told that he is risking
his own life if he meddles with mahogany.
Rubber-tapping, and other ways of
exploiting the forest without destroying it,
makes far greater economic, social and
ecological sense than wholesale clearance
for short-term proﬁt, but are rational argu-
ments enough in this money-crazy
world? [:1

DirectorVVilliam PennMott is 76, but he’s going likeGO pARADE MAGAZINE - Nov. 24, 1985

 

0U WANT TO KNOW
how much Americans
love their national parks?
To ﬁnd out, all we’d have
to do is close down Yo-
semite—even for a day—

and you’d hear a whoop .

and a holler unlike any
protest this country haseverwitnessed.”

William Penn Mott .lr., the passion-
ate, obsessively devoted director of the
National Park Service since May. likes
to raise a few eyebrows when he talks.

But is he really considering closing
some of the parks? Can you imagine
driving all day to Yosemite, only to ﬁnd
a blocked gate with a sign saying:
“CLOSED UNTIL FURTHER NO-
TICE”?

The truth is that Americans are all
but loving their national parks to death.
Accordingly, Mott warns, “Short of to-
tal closure of some parks, many of the
activities we once took for granted in
them must be restricted inevitably, or
the sheer crush of yearly visitors will
destroy the very resources that make
each park worthwhile visiting.”

If the parks can be saved Mott will
be their savior At a time when most
men have long since retired or slowed
down, Bill Mott at 76 is tackling the
most difﬁcult and exhausting job of his
50-year career as a public servant. Com-
ing to the $72,000 position at the Na-
tional Park Service, which has long been
noted for timid and undynarnic leader-
ship, he is considered by park employ-
ees and environmental groups to be a
welcome breath of ﬂesh air in an erstwhile
stagnant bureaucracy within the Depart-
ment of the Interior.

“Most Americans—and that includes
the politicians—don’t really know what
the National Park Service is and what
its mission is,” says Mott. “Educating
the public is one of the fust items on my
agenda.”

Most people don’t realize, for example,
that the National Park Service operates
and manages more than just the 48 des-
ignated National Parks like Yosemite,
Yellowstone and Grand Canyon. Within
the 79.5 million-acre system, there are
337 units categorized under such no-
menclature as National Monument,
Preserve, Lakeshore, Memorial, Park-
way, Historic Site, Battleﬁeld and Trail.
And there is at least one National Park
unit in every state except Delaware.

Protecting the nation’s natural wonders
and its resources seems nothing short of
a management nightmare for Mott when
you consider that, last year, 248 million
people visited the various park properties.
An increase of 3 percent was expected
this year, but by June 1985 there already
had been a whopping ll million more

than by the previous June. The result of
this rapidly expanding popularity is that
10 parks now require reservations for
their campsites at least three months in
advance for a ﬁrst-choice date. Visitor
overﬂow has led to many other prob-
lems for the parks. For example:

pede around Old Faithful in Yellow-

Fortunately, Mott is a workaholic who
has established a reputation for accom-

under Gov. Ronald Reagan (1967-75),
Mott was offered the very job he now
holds. But he refused it.

“I told Washington that I felt I hadn’t

in the Grand Canyon. In 1965, fewer

than 600 people had gone rafting on the
river. Just 10 years later, 15,000 were
ﬂoating through the canyon. On some
days, you could walk across the river—
there were so many rafts on it.

Besides overcrowding, most of the
major threats that reduce the quality of
the experience we have in a park, as
well as deplete its irreplaceable natural
resources, come from controllable
sources outside the park boundaries:

0 Air pollution. including acid rain, is
banning plant and animal life even at
some of the remotest parks. The Park
Service has identiﬁed 20 units in its
system in which air pollution has cut
the once-crystal-clear visibility of the
picturesque vistas. At Virginia’s Shen-
andoah National Park, for example, visi-
tors used tobeable . _ ;. '

see from one ridge
to another on the
clearest days.

0 Proposed geo- -

of Yellowstone may tap the very energy
supply that keeps Old Faithful working.
It is entirely possible that the drilling
will disrupt or totally stop the geyser’s
dazzling eruptions.

0 Many parks’ rare'plants. animals, and
archeological and historic artifacts are
being poached.

delicate ecosystems that support the nat-

While he was there,

strong internal and external opposition.
And when dogs were found to be causing

his gardening, time for a vigorous game
of tennis and his wife, Ruth, who elected
not to move to Washington but to main—
tain their house and garden. (His two
sons also live in California: William
[I], an agricultural economist in Marin
County; and John, a ranger at Henry
Cowell Redwood State Park in Santa
Cruz. His daughter, Nancy, died of can-
cer in 1981.)

Bill Mott’s ancestors were French.
When the family settled in America in
the 19th century. there were three clans.
One went to upstate New York and be-
came famous for its applesauce and ap-
ple juice; another went to New York
City and became known as major stock-
holders in General Motors. “My branch
of the family were the poor ones in
agriculture," says Mott. Poor or not.

 

 

they instilled in him a tenacious spirit.

The director of the National Park Ser-
vice is a plucky Johnny Appleseed cum
Harry Truman who sees things that are
wrong and sets out to correct them as
expeditiously as possible. To avoid the
time-consuming pomp and circumstance
that he would endure arriving in a staff
car, for example, Mott prefers to rent a
car and travel to parks as a low—profile
“visitor” and observer. That way. Mott
feels, he can identify problems ﬁrst-
hand and solve them quicker.

“Once, while I was at Yellowstone.”
he says, “I saw a mother try to put her
3-year-old on a wild buffalo’s back so
she could take a souvenir picture. I
stopped her and told her, ‘That’s a wild
animal. You can’t do that.’ What people
from urban areas don’t realize is that
these are not Walt Disney creatures but
wild animals. We are going to work out
techniques to effectively get informa-
tion to visitors as they ﬁrst enter the
parks

“ 5 job, no one made
any promises to me
about giving the N a-
tional Park Service
a larger budget to get
the improvemeri‘s i
wanted to make. By
educating the pub-
lic and Congress
about what we need
and why, we will
gather the necessary
support. I would suspect that. if i were
to ask you what we’re spending to main-
tain Yosemite or Yellowstone. you
wouldn’t know. The public doesn’t know.
We are going to tell them what it costs
to do these jobs and what we actually
have. and I think they will respond.
Each Congressperson who has a park in
his or her district will get a status report
on it every six months. Up to now, they
have received no information like this
from us.

“With the newly raised entrance fees
and emergency money provided by Con-
gress, we have been able to get a lot of
the accumulated deterioration fixed . par-
ticularly the water and sewer lines, elec-
tricity and ancient wiring. These basic
repairs had been neglected, and it took a
billion dollars to get things back in shape.’

Raising money from the private sector.
through grants from corporations, is one
innovative route Mott wants the Park
Service to try. “There are very few fed-
eral agencies that are allowed by law to

solicit donations. We are, and we will——
if that's what it’s going to take to get the
funds we need,” he declares.

It was primarily through organiza-
tions outside the government that mon-
ey was raised to buy the land for what
may become the newest addition to the
park system, the proposed Tallgrass Prai-
rie in northeast Oklahoma. .

“Did you know that nearly every
tallgrass prairie in the United States has

been wiped out?” asks Mott. “These ‘

were the types of prairies to which the
westward pioneers settled or passed
through. They represent what the Mid-
west frontier was like before it was
developed.”

Another area of opportunity is Alas-
ka, where the nation’s largest national
park—Wrangell-St. Elias, with 13.4 mil-
lion acres—was established in l982.
“Here we have a chance to do it right
from scratch so the parks don’t fall vic-
tim to the problems now facing the ones
in the lower 48 states,“ says,Mott. “We
must get a plan to manage the parks up
there based on solid research and not
create research from predrawn plans, as
has been done in the other parks.”

Mott's “No. l duty” right now, though,
is saving the grizzly bears in Yellow-
stone from extinction. It is estimated
that only 300 bears remain, of which
just 30 are cub-bearing females.

“The grizzly bear is one of America‘s
last remaining great symbols of the wild
beauty of our nation. We absolutely
cannot stand idly by and permit the loss
of this magniﬁcent animal. The saving
of the grizzly must be elevated to the

: level of a national campaign. If we can‘t
save the bears, we may not be able to
save ourselves,” Mott insists, an emo-
tional quiver in hisvoice.

“If it means ripping up a campground
near a grizzly habitat and moving it to
the other side of the park, then that’s
what we will do. even if concession-
-aires complain that we’re taking away
their proﬁts. You can always ﬁnd new
business. but you’ll never get thegrizzlies
back from extinction."

Trained in landscape architecture at
Michigan State and then at Berkeley,
‘ Mott began his park career in 1933 as a

Service in San Francisco. From l946
to 1962, he was superintendent of parks
in Oakland, Calif, where he gained
national prominence for reshaping the
city with parks to enhance the quality of

parks in northern Califomia—with time
out as a parks consultant to Australia
and Costa Rica—until he was appointed
National Park Service director.

Yet, with all this experience, the ﬁrst
thing Mott did when he took ofﬁce was
to read the law written back in I916 that
established the National Park Service.

“What struck me immediately was
the phrase ‘to leave the scenery and the

 

 

 

landscape architect for the National Park ’

life. He continued to manage regional _

 

 

 

natural and historical objects and wildlife
therein unimpaired for the enjoyment
of future generations,” says Mott. “I
take that as my gospel.

“As stewards, we must not and should
not use up the resource or diminish its
value. When in any doubt, we must err
on the side of preservation.” But he
adds, “Ofcourse, should we subsequently
ﬁnd ourselves wrong, we can always ,
provide for more public use. .

“The parks are America’s universi-
ties without walls. Not only can daily
visitors learn from them, but scientists
and researchers are only just tapping
the potential of wildlife in them. We are
preserving within the parklands reserve
gene pools for future research. 1 just got
a note on my desk about an amazing

, fungus that was found in Pinelands Na-

tional Reserve in New Jersey which can
absorb DDT and other dangerous chem-
icals. If that park was not there and
development had been allowed on the
land instead, would this discovery have
been made?

“An armadillo 'found in one of the
parks was discovered to have’the very
antibodies that can stop leprosy. How
do we know that there isn’t some rare

: plant or animal in the parks that has the

needed chemical to eradicate some in-
curable disease?

“There has got to be more communi-
cation between the different government
agencies,” Mott contends. “Sometimes
all the good the Park Service does can
be wiped out in a single action by an-
other agency whose particular mission
is in conflict with our objective. When I
have talks with other departments, 1 am

. governed by one unforgettable fact: The

land does not belong to individual bu-
reaus of government. It belongs to the
people of the United States.

“If you sit down and talk with people. ‘
l have found, there are always areas you
can agree on. It’s important to take care
of the things that you agree on ﬁrst.
because it makes it easier to solve the
issues you disagree on. You don’t solve
problems in confrontation. You do it
through conversation and negotiation.

“For instance, we’re going to talk
with the people who fly helicopters and
planes in and over the Grand Canyon.
We now have more than 100,000 ﬂights
a year. We’re going to have to limit
them, because the noise and disturbances
they create are taking away from the
beauty and quiet we are preserving. That
is going to be a confrontation unless we
can get some understanding. They are
making money but at the price of every-
body else’s enjoyment.”

Mott admits that some of the Park
Service’s problems are too vast to solve.
But he adds, “I’m an optimist. I think
the job can get done. 1 never say die.
Americans love their parks too much to
lose them. We’ll give them the facts—-
be it about ﬁnances, acid rain or overde-
velopment—and they will help us pre—
serve and protect them. You‘ll see." E]

very low-frequency sounds.”

Back at her office in Ithaca, N.Y.,
she and her colleagues gathered ul-
trasensitive acoustic equipment and
returned to Portland to make more
intensive investigations. They found
that there was a spot on an elephant’s
forehead that fluttered or trembled
when 'the animal uttered audible
vocal calls such as rumbles or pur-
' ring sounds. The researchers then no-

ticed that whenever their sensitive

metering equipment registered very
low-frequency sounds that they could
not hear, that area of the elephant’s
forehead also fluttered. Mrs. Payne’s
hunch had proved to be correct.

An account of her team’s research
is scheduled to appear in the forth-
coming issue of Behavioral Ecology
and Sociobiology, a scientific journal.

The continuing research. project is.

sponsored by the World Wildlife
Fund, the Cornell Laboratory of Omi-
thology and the National Geographic
Society.

Research on Animal Sounds

Considerable study has been de-
voted to the use by animals as diverse
as bats and shrews of very high-fre-
quency sounds above the range of
human hearing, which is from about
20 to 20,000 hertz. But little has been
known about the use of extremely
low-frequency sounds by animals.

A few bird species, such as pigeons,
guinea fowl and the flightless casso-
waries and rheas are known to per-
ceive infrasounds, but their relevance
to the birds’ lives is not fully under-
stood. Fin whales have been found to
produce intense infrasonic calls that,
theoretically, can travel very long
distances in water. But the purpose of
such calls is not known.

Scientific observations of African

elephants in Amboseli National Park,

in Kenya and of Asian elephants in
zoos in Oregon and Florida have indi-
cated that the infrasonic calls seem to
convey a variety of messages to the
elephants that receive them. '

In studies of groups of elephants,
the researchers noted with their low-

frequency recording equipment that
when a calf would scream, several
adult females would move toward it
and start vocalizing in low frequen-
cies. The adults also uttered many in-
frasonic calls as they began to move
as a group from one spot to another,
or as they shooed a stray baby back to
its mother.

Researchers hypothesize that when
male elephants are in must, a condi-
tion of heightened sexual activity,
they listen for the long-distance infra"-
sonic signals of females in estrus,
enabling them to home in on the fe-
males. This would explain one of the
great mysteries that has long puzzled
elephant field researchers: How do
males find females several miles
away during the very brief period of
two days a month when the females
are fertile?

An Earlier Discovery

Mrs. Payne, who has spent two dec-
ades studying whale behavior and

communication with her former hus- ‘

band, Roger Payne, is known for her
discovery that all humpback whales
in a group will change the melodies of
their songs in exactly the same way‘.
Her finding is evidence that the song
changes are passed on by learning, an
example of cultural evolution, which
can be compared to the way aspects
of human culture change. Her re-
search produced the most extensively
documented example of a cultural
trait exhibited by a wild animal.

The voices of the different ele--
phants were found to have different
harmonic structures. And many of
the infrasonic calls were found to
have an audible harmonic tone that
was registered by the human ear as a
discernible rumbling noise.

The audible noises elephants make
-— their trumpeting, growls and rum—
blings — have long been believed to
be their only vocal means of sending
signals or more complicated mes-

- sages to each other, in addition to

their communications by smell and
touch. The Cornell team’s discovery,
however, indicates the existence of a
more sophisticated complex of ele-
phant communication than was
previously known.

elephants from extinction,” she said,
pointing out that Asian elephants are

officially listed as endangered and

that African elephants are threatened
by poachers, whose depradations are
still of major proportions despite ef-
forts to halt them. ,
“Our ultimate hope is that our work
may increase the elephants’ chances
of survival in the world,” she said.
“The more humans knowabout other
animals, the more humans realize
that animals, too, lead rich complex
lives with concerns similar enough to
ours that they should not be ignored. ”
She noted that Cynthia Moss and
Joyce Poole, wildlife researchers of
the Amboseli Elephant Research
Project in Kenya, have studied the in-
tricate and sophisticated social struc-
ture of elephants and found that their
relationships extend well beyond the
core family group through a multi-
tiered network of relationships en-
compassing scores of animals.

potential would be an asset to a soci-
ety whose families divide into groups
with different degrees of stability,
different schedules and different rea-
sons for gathering or dispersion, Mrs.
Payne said. Observers of both Asian
and African elephants have been puz-
zled for years by occurrences of sud-
den coordinated movements of large
groups of elephants when no signal
was apparent to human observers.
“The use of infrasonic calls may offer
an explanation for this,” Mrs. Payne
said.

“We hope that learning the mean-f
ing of these calls may help save the

ins for scores of years, caring for
each others’ needs. The actions of
baby elephants often dictate what ac-
tivities the group as a whole engages
in, the two scientists found. When a
baby wants to take a nap, for exam-
ple, the entire family group will stop
at the scene and wait for the baby to
complete its nap before the group
moves on. ‘

Within the next two years, Mrs.
Payne and Dr. Langbauer and Mrs.
Thomas plan to study the infrasounds
and corresponding actions of both
Asian and African elephants in the
wild. Using specially designed equip-
ment at lookout stations, they will be
able to observe and film the elephants
at close hand while recording both
their audible and infrasonic calls. The
results of this research are expected
to provide an even deeper insight into
the role elephant communications
play in their behavior and social
structures.

 




 

NEW YORK TIMES - Feb. 11, 1986

‘Secret Language’

 

They seem to emit
sounds too low to be
heard by humans.

 

By BAYARD WEBSTER

 

LEPHANTS emit low-frequency
vocal sounds, inaudible to man,
that may be used as a “secret”
language to communicate with

other members of a herd over both long

and short distances, researchers at Cor-
nell University have discovered.

The sounds, believed to originate from
a fluttering spot on the giant animals’
foreheads, are at frequencies in the
range of 14 to 24 hertz, below the thresh-
old of human hearing.

It is the first evidence that land mam-
mals can produce such infrasonic
sounds, and it adds the elephants’ basso
calls to the wildlife choir that includes
the high-frequency shrieks of bats, the
soprano voices of porpoises, the alto
wails of wolves and coyotes and the
tenor-to-bass-range songs of humpback
whales. The significance and role of
such sounds, audible to people or not,
has long puzzled wildlife biologists.

“This discovery is like suddenly find—
ing a tribe with a hitherto unknown lan-
guage,” said Dr. Thomas Lovejoy, vice
president for science of the World Wild-

 

\

Found in Elephants

life Fund in WashingtOn. “I think it will
add a whole new dimension to‘our under-
standing of elephant communications

'and social systems.”

Preliminary observations by the re-
searchers that correlate the elephants’
utterance of low-frequency sounds with
their behavior lead the scientists to be-
lieve that the low tones may be a com-
munications method.

“We hope that our research and future
investigations may enable us to get a
better insight into how elephants live
and what part these calls play in coordi-
nating their extremely complicated so-
cial behavior,” said Katharine Payne, a
member of the Cornell Laboratory of Or-
nithology’s investigating team, which in-
cludes William Langbauer Jr. and Eliza-
beth M. Thomas.
