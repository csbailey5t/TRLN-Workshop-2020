CROSS FOX

Band of black across his shoulders
band of black along his back

the only stranger born into a litter
of red brothers and sisters

eyes bright, but his brighter

with another knowledge.

This is the one the breeders sought

the one whose blood would have brought forth
in the Fur Farm cages a rainbow of colors,
platinum, silver, costly gold.

This is the fox who was not caught.

The cross he carries on his back

is the four directions of this land,

the ways the People ofthe Dawn knew,
ways of the four winds and not the ﬁgure
held in carved agony, the dying god.

Living, he carries his cross
from the Earth

he was born in

back to the Earth.

He will not die in the air.

Essay

So many poems about the deaths of animals.

' Wilbur’s toad, Kinnell’s porcupine, Eberhart’s squirrel,
and that poem by someone—Hecht? Merrill?—
about cremating a woodchuck. But mostly
I remember the outrageous number of them,
as if every poet, I too, had written at least
one animal elegy; with the result that today
when I came to a good enough poem by Edwin Brock
about ﬁnding a dead fox at the edge of the sea
I could not respond: as if permanent shock
had deadened me. And then after a moment
I began to give way to sorrow (watching myself
sorrowlessly the while), not merely because
part of my being had been violated and annulled,
but because all these many poems over the years
have been necessary,—suitable and correct. This
has been the time of the ﬁnishing off of the animals.
They are going away—their fur and their wild eyes,
their voices. Deer leap and leap in front
of the screaming snowmobiles until they'leap
out of existence. Hawks circle once or twice
around their shattered nests and then they climb
to the stars. I have lived with them ﬁfty years,
we have lived with them ﬁfty million years,
and now they are going, almost gone. I don’t know
if the animals are capable of reproach.

But clearly they do not bother to say good-bye.

DAVID CONSTANTINE
1944-

( Watchingr for Dolphins D

In the summer months on every crossing to Piraeus
One noticed that certain passengers soon rose

From seats in the packed saloon and with serious
Looks and no acknowledgement of a common purpose
Passed forward through the small door into the bows
To watch for dolphins. One saw them lose

 

Every other wish. Even the lovers

Turned their desires on the sea, and a fat man
Hung with equipment to photograph the occasion
Stared like a saint, through sad bi-focals; others,
Hopeless themselves, looked to the children for they
Would see dolphins if anyone would. Day after day

Or on their last opportunity all gazed

Undecided whether a ﬂat calm were favourable

Or a sea the sun and the wind between them raised
To a likeness of dolphins. Were gulls a sign, that fell

Screeching from the sky or over an unremarkable place
Sat in a silent school? Every face

After its character implored the sea.

All, unaccustomed, wanted epiphany,

Praying the sky would clang and the abused Aegean
Reverberate with cymbal, gong and drum.

We could not imagine more prayer, and had they then
On the waves, on the climax of our longing come

Smiling, snub-nosed, domed like satyrs, oh

We should have laughed and lifted the children up
Stranger to stranger, pointing how with a leap

They left their element, three or four times, centred
On grace, and heavily and warm re-entered,
Looping the keel. We should have felt them go

Further and further into the deep parts. But soon
We were among the great tankers, under their chains
In black water. We had not seen the dolphins

But woke, blinking. Eyes cast down

With no admission of disappointment the company
Dispersed and prepared to land in the city.

THE HARVEST

.xaImmersed . . .
tangled brush of
a slash slope
Gathering serviceberries,
cool mountain dampness
of day's end
Pretending to be a bear
(brown wool sweater!) . . .

How would it feel to be shot there,
fist full of plump purple berries,
mouth full of sweetness?

Crumpled suddenly into the bush,

staring through blurred branches

into approaching night;

bewildered, hearing voices and footfalls ‘
crashing through the thicket;

not understanding what a rifle is—
nor this searing, violent death.

 




Lizard

In the purple evening light a lizard dozes on a boulder,
Liquescent of lapis lazuli, his horny eyes half discs of silver.
From the dry pod of his body, at long intervals only, a smoulder

Of breath puffs through the leathery cords of his throat.

With the blue of the ﬁrst night-mist around his nostrils

Like the dying smoke of a bright bowel-ﬁre, he lies at the edge of a lost
world, distant and remote.

But as the mountains maned with violet clouds loom in the twilight like
a dinosaur,

The dwarfed claws stir restive on the rock as though he would rise with
ponderous step

And lumber hugely among the peaks, fanging the heavens hour by
hour.

The Ducks on Wissahickon Creek
It's never as simple as this, of course.
Most of the time, hard questions

gnaw at the brain like rats,
and it}s hard to imagine a life

that isn't forever perplexing.
But today, with last night's snow

still undisturbed and slowly turning
wet and heavy under February sun,

a pair of mallards followed
by a pair of perfect wakes paddled

side by side through quiet water,
so sure of where they were going.

Paddling in two feet of ice melt

between the bank and the lake's white core,

a little snapper

poked its beaked nose under the dock,

pushed at moldering leaves on the bottom,

searching for something. Unpreturbed

by frigid water, by an approaching stranger, it hung there
on the cusp of the netherworld,

big webbed feet stroking slowly.

I knelt down at the Water's edge and

saw its escape route—-a dark tunnel of water
under the ice. It didn't escape

but swam toward me,

placing front flippers on the bank near my feet.
I saw the curved black nails, graceful and tough.
It stretched its head--so darkly damascened--
toward my face, neck lengthening until I saw

the pale hidden skin of the throat.

 

I saw the strain of its looking, black eyes
rolling toward me as I spoke in a soft voice.

Could it be lonely after a long winter?

Did it want food from me

or did curiosity hold it there?

Slowly it dipped back into the water and sank down,
merging with brown leaves, sunken

sticks until I could see only

surface reflections-~sky, trees, my face.

 

After years of seeking, this time
I was just there—-

a gray day, nothing special--

and the lake, the cold, the deep
came to me.

WHALE WATCH

The clean sea rocks us small again.
Hushed, we wait,

hung with binoculars and telephoto lenses,
'all the gear of second sight, scanning

for one plume of breath.

Out here we admit our longing.

Then they explode,

breaching and steaming like monumental facts—-
big as moving vans, so close

we hear them suck and blow.

Bravo! we shout, gasping and clapping.
How beautiful they are

with their huge heads and mystical grins,
bodies scarred by ships' propellers,

old harpoons. They slap the waves and
dive deep, churning the sea to
whirlpools of turquoise foam.

I think we needed to see a creature
older, stronger, gentler than ourselves,
whose name means rolling,

who travels with the sea's own motion,
high white breath threading together
blue and deeper blue.

SUSAN FAWCETT

 




SHORE LINE

At the shore I compare my hand

to the starfish, slow and pliant
in the silt. I flatten my fingers
against its five identical spokes
crawling unencumbered

by wrist, arm or trunk.

We pay a price

for that branching long ago
when simple radial arm became
extension of the mind

instead of mindless limb.

The human hand, obedient

to all commands, grOpes,

closes and takes. But at night

it fidgets, creeping over smoothed
bedsheets with tube-footed stealth.
The pores open like air pocks in sand
and a salty wet slicks the skin

as if the hand,

glimpsing its origins,
wept for them.

SUSAN FAWCETT

 




HiBBos

In the riverbed

pocked grey snouts drift}

above the suck of mud.

Weightless, they drowse
in the cooling ooze.

Their brains go soft

as mud, lulled
by the slip and pull

of earth's slow tides.

Springing the Traps

Evening,

The planets hanging like ﬂakes
Inside the edge of their orbits,
The ﬁelds locked in place,
Their long successions
Dovetailed into the dark.

This is the landscape of habit.
Nights like this

I ﬁnd my way without a lamp
Down to the trap-line

My neighbor has strung
Along the pond’s reedy shore.

All around it lives pass through
The surface of the earth.

The dark behind my eyes

Fills my body, my breath

Trails off into the trees,

A part of all that rises.

Before me the pond is perfect

And ﬁlled with a wintry glow.

Fish dance like foxﬁre

On the tongues of the sunken traps.

I jam a stick down each throat,

And one by one

The traps go off like gunshots
Barking across the ﬁelds,
Like ice cracking

Through bedrock, or steel
Snapping the bones.

And it is paltry little,
Which is all that can be done.

679 The Slaughter-House

Under the big SOO-watted lamps, in the huge sawdusted
government inspected slaughter-house,

head down from books and clamps, run on trolleys over
troughs, y .

the animals die.

Whatever terror their dull intelligences feel
or what agony distorts their most protruding eyes

the incommunicable narrow skulls conceal.
Across the sawdusted ﬂoor,

ignorant as children, they see the butcher’s slow
methodical approach

in the bloodied apron, leather cap above, thick square
shoes below, .

struggling to comprehend this unique vision upside down,

and then approximate a human scream ,
as from the throat slit like a letter ~-

the blood empties, and the windpipe, like a blown valve,
spurts steam. ‘ '

But I, sickened equally with the ox and lamb,
misread my fate, -
mistake the butcher’s love
who kills me for the meat I am

to feed a hungry multitude beyond the sliding doors.
I, too, misjudge the real

purpose of this huge shed I’m herded in: not for my love
or lovely wool am I here,

but to make some world a meal.
See, how on the unsubstantial air

I kick, bleating my private woe,
as upside down my rolling sight '

somesaults, and frantically I try to set my world upright;
too late learning why I’m hung here,

whose nostrils bleed, whose life runs out from eye and ear.

Love Song for a Jellyfish

How amazed I was, when I was a child,

To see your life on the sand.

To see you living in your jelly shape,

Round and slippery and dangerous.

You seemed to have fallen

Not from the rim of the sea,

But from the galaxies.

Stranger, you delighted me. Weird object of
The stinging world. '

I will save you.

 

His name is Pepsi. He was a gift

From the American Pepsi-Cola Company

To the city of Milano. I wrote

I received, a month later, a letter

From the Italian head of the company.
He told me the elephant, Pepsi, had
Been blessed by a cardinal when he was
Given to the Milano Zoo.

I imagine the

Miserable elephant in captivity.
At night I lie awake

Plotting our escape.

I think of the history of the elephant:
Heroic and courageous beasts
Worshiped in India, thought of as
Holy men in Bangkok, treated with love
Throughout Asia. In my childhood

I saw them wrapped in circus dresses
And made to perform-

Displayed

By managers who found them funny. I
Think of the elephant with a chain
On his leg. I think of his life.

His captivity.

Each night
I prepare our departures.

A bat is born

Naked and blind and pale.

His mother makes a pocket of her tail

And catches him. He clings to her long fur

By his thumbs and toes and teeth.

And then the mother dances through the night
Doubling and l00ping, soaring, somersaulting—
Her baby hangs on underneath.

All night, in happiness, she hunts and ﬂies.
Her high sharp cries

Like shining needlepoints of sound

Go out into the night and, echoing back,

Tell her what they have touched.

She hears how far it is, how big it is,

Which way it’s going:

She lives by hearing.

The mother eats the moths and gnats she catches
In full flight; in full flight

The mother drinks the water of the pond

She skims across. Her baby hangs on tight.
Her baby drinks the milk she makes him

In moonlight or starlight, in mid-air.

Their single shadow, printed on the moon

Or fluttering across the stars,

Whirls on all night; at daybreak

The tired mother flaps home to her rafter.

The others all are there.

They hang themselves up by their toes,

They wrap themselves in their brown wings.
Bunched upside-down, they sleep in air.

Their sharp ears, their sharp teeth, their quick sharp faces
Are dull and slow and mild.

All the bright day, as the mother sleeps,

She folds her wings about her sleeping child.

NURTURE

From a documentary on marsupials I learn
that a pillowcaSe makes a fine
SL1bStltthC pouch for an orphaned kangaroo.

I am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue.
They are warm in the throat. I suffer, the critic proclaims,
from an overabundance of maternal genes.

Bring me your fallen ﬂedgling, your bummer lamb,
lead the abused, the Starvelings. into my barn.
Advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn.

And had there been a wild child—
filrlzy andﬁerce as aferret, he is called
in one nineteenth—century account—

a wild child to love, it is safe to assume,

given my ﬁreside inked with paw prints,

there would have been room.

Coyotes

You might swear they're women

The first you hear them cry——
Somewhere unseen among the hills,
Beneath the swelling moon, they howl.
One by one, the voices join

In clamor so sharp it can cut.

Has violence been done?

The heart becomes a fist.

Ready and impotent.

But it is only the coyotes
Sounding like women crying.

You see them seldom,

Those few nights when the cycle

Of the moon intersects

The cycle of garbage,

Because they know both.

Down they come, these edge—walkers,
These walkers in twilight, down
From the Hollywood Hills

To take from the homes

Of rock stars, movie stars,

Other minor luminaries--

The money—men, developers.

They steal the trash, mainly,

But with the small game gone

They will take the random cat

Or cuddly puppy. And then that cry—-
Sending a shudder coldly

Through the sleeper's bones.

If only you understood this music,
This language of dissonance.

You might know what they know,
Share the night, walk with them
Through singing canyons, across
The carpet of leaf and bark
The eucalyptus spreads along
With its promiscuous fragrance.

 

 

 

 




 

     

 

I read once how a coyote,
Driven by hunger it was presumed,
Stole an infant from the crib

Its mother had thoughtlessly

Left unguarded: Plump and succulent,
The words come against the will,

This rich gift, this offering.

That night I listened closer,
Listened and watched from my porch.
Three coyotes trotted along

The trail the motorbikes cut

Into the hillside. They looked

Like plain dogs--bigger, maybe--

And sickly thin, their fur matted,
Scraggly. Then they were shadow.
Then gone. And their voices rose
Anew as they must also have risen
Above the seaside condominiums,
Across the desert fringed with light,
Wailing against the light

That each day creeps up what is wild
Like a slow fire. Below my house,
The Valley overflowed

With light like fire.

They knew, the coyotes,

I say they must have known
That it will not be darkness.
That it will not be the night
That finally swallows all.

They, too, wept for the child.




Beaver Pond

Not furred nor wet, the pointing words yet make

a feel of plush slip moistly through the mind.

Tires grate to gravelled stops; tourists, lumpy injeai
question and cluster round the still, small pool.
Twigs, peanuts flip .

on the wrought island on the Farther side——

its basket crown, cunningly cut,

entangles all eyes, but none'in return

looks through the sealed lattice. Water absorbs
nut, cry and pebble, offers in reply

no waking head, and no binocular

searching route to the shelter but reveals

on the shut surface only its blind, mirrored eye.

And yet I feel the water in my ears,

nose sucks the strong root—smell _

and light retracts among the embroidered weeds

in rich deep greens and brown that grow

more coloured with acquaintance.

The velvet bodies of our infrequent kind

press here beside me. Deep beaver l

greet you under the masked water from my secret house,
neither will break the public surface against my wish

For sticks or stones or softest coaxing words.

JAN AND THE DEER

Han's hair and beard were still wet from swimming
when he tOld me, 'I caught a deer today,‘
and paused for me to ask him what he meant.

nWhile swimming with children from our preschool,
he saw a deer jump into the river,

chased by a dog, which also jumped in

and was overtaking her in the current

when he swam out and caught the deer himself.

I could picture Jan grinning through his black beard,
holding the doe upside-down by the ankles,

wading ashore to show her to the children-

He set her down and held her firmly while

they petted her and-pulled ticks from her hide.

He gestured, showing me how his arms were moved
each time she tried a powerful kick.

I could feel the energy in her leg8

restrained by the muscles of his slow grip.

When he let go, with the children standing back,
she paused before bolting, and someone held

the dog long enough for her to escape.

Then they searched each other over for ticks.

HUDSON’S GEES

. . I have, from time to time, related some incident
of my boyhood, and these are contained in various
chapters in The Naturalist in La Plata, Birds and
Man, Adventures among Birds. . . . "

W. H. Hudson, in Far Away and Long Ago.

Hudson tells us of them,
the two migrating geese,
she hurt in the wing
indomitably walking

the length of a continent,
and he wheeling above,
calling his distress.

They could not have lived.
Already I see her wing
scraped past the bone

as she drags it through rubble.
A fox, maybe, took her

in his snap jaws. And what
would he do, the point

of his circling gone?

The wilderness of his cry
falling through an air
turned instantly to winter
would warn the guns of him.
If a fowler dropped him,

let it have been quick,
pellets hitting brain

and heart so his weight
came down senseless,

and nothing but his body
to enter the dog’s mouth.

F The Snake Trying

The snake trying

to escape the pursuing stick,
with sudden curvings of thin
long body. How beautiful

and graceful are his shapes!

He glides through the water away
from the stroke. 0 let him go
over the water

into the reeds to hide
without hurt. Small and green
he is harmless even to children.

Along the sand

he lay until observed

and chased away, and now
he vanishes in the ripples
among the green slim reeds.

STALKING THE FLORIDA PANTHER

Camped near fresh tracks, we wait.
Such blackness-~the leafy horizon
closed shut like a fan.

The fire burns in whispers.
All night it has eaten itself
like a trapped animal

down to glowing red bones.
We lie on separate hummocks
in this river of grass,

the water moving
as stealthily as I imagine
the cat--its plush paws

dimpling the black muck
as it hunts. What I know:
that desire Spreads like light

without doctrine. By morning
the sawgrass will shatter
the swamp to a million

glittering shards. Now,
moving for each other
in the darkness, our skin shines

like flares. I want to think

the cat is watching as our bodies
pull the wilderness in.

BEACHED WHALE

Imagine gasping on the grainy sand,

dead weight,

unable to retreat or turn, or to advance——
like a newborn capsized in its crib.

One among many may doubt

whatever doomed them here,

feel, more than the others,

the indignity of air,

against the weightlessness of water,
where the boundary of the difference
was negotiable and free.

Now it's intractable,

or nearly so, so near

the mist, the palpable scent,

in the fluid and sleep—filled air.

But what lives just beyond that barrier
of sight? What transformation

could impel this body there?

Once, beneath the water, was a person
who struggled without grace,

who flailed and then grew sluggish,
sinking in a roll, as a stone

or dead fish sinks to the bottom,

before rising up again.

But as the body fell,

some lightness left it, easily,

withOut commotion, and in that moment,
something rising, falling,

a kind of rightness floated in the water world,
emanated from the path of broken bubbles,
then everything returned to normal.

Now the parching swells and pushes down,
gasping passes into shallow inhalations,
and the last regurgitation, liquid,
erupts over the sand,

and sinks without a sound.

FEEDING THE FISH AT HANAUMA BAY

A bit of bread between finger and thumb,

and the fish come:_

striped butterfly fish, translucent surgeonfish,
yellow tang and the rainbow colored wragge. '

They eat my fingers and from my fingers.
They swim in almost coyly
and swipe at bread. Harrumph!

Behind their lips
there are tiny white teeth.

Every day strangers come

to the beach and take up a task

they may not even recognize,

participate in a custom started by people
they will never know, to be continued

by others undreamed of.

By these invisible traditions, these unlearned rituals,
the universe comes to know itself. For a few seconds
it is possible to forget the terrible loneliness

and become aware, as the fish dart and cluster

in small crowds, of the presence

there in the flashing water.

At the Reelfoot Slaughter House

The tin walls are suddenly around you
.Rising to meet roof beams
At angles that cut and slice

This slant of light

Breaking from their imperfect union.

You are below

Imagining your own white bones and

Across alabaster ball and socket
In perfect alignment

For the walking

That carries you now

Along the sawdust rows

Between the busy stations

The pools glimmering at your feat

Rising to cuff your ankles.

Slaughter House—~2

But you move too swiftly in any case

A slightly awkward lumber

Until at the flung-back double doors
The moans are finally behind you

Rising in the steam of hair

In that other, twilight land

Dark except for thin blades of light
Cutting from roof to floor

Touching the back of your neck so gently
Like a hand beneath a collar

Tucking a wisp of hair.

Down a dirt road

Lined with pines old as bones

A baby wails in its mother’s arms

Safe and secure from all this alarm

And you think of the silly virginia wool!
Afraid to let the {ood touch her lips
Letting her body gnaw itself

You know we must eat

To raise our bulk above the ground.

And so you watch

The dazed bulls in unison led
Down the ramp

By the smell of their own kind

Emerging so neatly wrapped and stamped

In pink and white, thigh and rump

Arrayed side by side
In perfect crimson rows

Along a stainless isle

who reach nonchalantly for this life

weighing once, then twice its heft
You’re safe at last
In this blaze of meat

Choosing to be diminished

By what you eat.

ARRANGEMENTS

We sleep together
two cats and two people fur
against our skins our skins
against their fur.

Our legs are all mixed up

and their tails are under our necks.

Sleeping and waking
waking and sleeping

we shift from one side
to the other.

Only when morning comes
do we find out
who has furry tails

who wears glasses.

 




Living With the Wounnded

The doe in the backyard is my secret, mine and the hillside’s.
She jumped the fence last week and stayed, nuzzling her way
through weeds and briars, eating the pear trees. When I go out
she lopes away. She is all muscle and highheels, this teenager,
slipping behind the hedgerow.

At dusk she settles chewing her cud, watching me
through the kitchen window. from somewhere, and
when it comes to me I laugh. e. How long has this
been going on, I wonder, me on the hillside full of
animals?

We are so tolerant. The doe browses from bush to tree,
sharp-stepping aroun My dog lies chewing grass,
embarrassed. "That "She is in our

yard. What kind of watchdog are you?"

The dog wags her tail faintly, and pretends fatigue.

When a shot rings out I feel wild grief. I run to the sink and

clutch it, hoisting myself as if to peer an extra six inches

into a fear I cannot run from. The dog is puzzled, watching me.
Suddenly I see the doe, under the apple , frozen as I am. I
am so thankful. This strange and foolish passion for an animal I
cannot help has left me helpless. I am becoming ﬁwild too.

\ "Remember," my housemate said, "to leave a note for the cleaning
lady." I remember about the note, but not what’s in it. I have
an urge to lick the pencil. "Lupe," I write, and leave this on
the sink, uéﬁder the window, "please don’t touch the deer in the
backyard. I like it. Thanks. Mary."

Deer's Death

The springtime long dead
desirous to arise
in resinous white flower

deer trails straggle over hillsides
fragrant with kit-kit-dizze

down escarpements they run

down ravines '

through miniature red forests of manzanita
losing themselves in the shade

of yellow pine along the Tuolumne

just there a wounded deer has eluded
the dogs of his tormentors
has come to slake intolerable thirsts

beside the blasted twisted hulk

of an ancient pine

lying half ashore

hags hands shot Skyward from the water

he has used a forked branch for support
his blood free-flowing with current

and with neck outstretched

the light left him

left him standing in a holy place
where fly blown desire

leans in the shallows

where water and blood conmingled
flow down to sea

and the heart of the earth keeps turning
beating

and the sun's blood runs chill

lightly covering the trees

WILD HORSES

They graze under a full moon

up country in Carson Forest.
Unlike tame horses who lie down
in stalls, they sleep all night
under the stars, tails giving

-an occasional flip against flies.
They don't know how old they are,
or that winter is always coming,
or that somewhere there are

bins of grain and bales of hay.

At night when I turn into my own
driveway, with the lights of cities
only miles away, I think I hear
wild horses gallop on the dry

river bed. Red flags quiver

in their nostrils when they run.
They move so fast, I can't

see their washboard ribs.

Often I lie with my eyes open
hoping to see the watering hole
where wild horses drink,
sucking the good'water

between their teeth.

Any Other Pasture

Yesterday, the heat, today
the rain begins. The moles,
busy in their labyrinths,
move mountains.

Our dog wears tight lips
in a wise face.

The tumor had blossomed
overnight. Deeper than

nature's claw, there has

been much cutting and sewing.
The plastic bucket over

her head keeps her from chewing,
like a trapped coyote.

To restore the corrugated flesh
we try comfrey, even, taken

from the woods. The vet's faith,
foolish as our nostrums,

works no better.

One corner of the wound

sighs as she breathes.

Her nose a compass, she moves

like a bent shopping cart.

The bucket keeps her from seeing.

She blunders and trips on old scents.

We know nothing will work.

This is a secret we would like

to keep from ourselves. Our eyes
look for another language.

The rules for any other pasture
seem more reasonable.

The vet's needle
would be an opening gate.

Calling Ravens

The first irreverent sound is like a broken-toe

cry in the dark, but it is morning

and the playful shadow circling

signals the ravens' return to Roane Mountain.

I lift my head from my sleeping bag and scream back

to see if the raven will turn and answer.

The bird answers out of curiosity. He'd like to know
.what creature would call a raven so crudely.

From the air I must look like I am being swallowed

by a large blue caterpillar. Three more ravens

join to see the feeding as I pull the mummy bag

over my head and barely peer out with eye and nose.

My breath smokes in the mountain air; the ravens all

scream to coax me into making my noise.

So I call again a little too shrill

and they recognize me, become bored

and fly away batting and nudging each other in raven joy.

Quite awake now, I think about hot coffee and watch

the sun rise above mulitple mountain humps

where there must be thousands of ravens screaming,

flirting in the brisk air and this thought is broken

by more shadows tracing the mountain contour.

I blurt out a shrill cry which sends a puff of steam

drifting like a small cloud into the air.

They do not answer.

 




The Ducks on Wissahickon Creek
It's never as simple as this, of course.
Most-of the time, hard questions

gnaw at the brain like rats,
and it's hard to imagine a life

that isn't forever perplexing.
But today, with last night's snow

still undisturbed and slowly turning
wet and heavy under February sun,

a pair of mallards followed
by a pair of perfect wakes paddled

side by side through quiet water,
so sure of where they were going.

Essay

So many poems about the deaths of animals.
Wilbur’s toad, Kinnell’s porcupine, Eberhart’s squirrel,
and that poem by someone—Hecht? Merrill?-—-
about cremating a woodchuck. But mostly

I remember the outrageous number of them,

as if every poet, I too, had written at least

one animal elegy; with the result that today

when I came to a good. enough poem by Edwin Brock
about ﬁnding a dead fox at the edge of the sea

I could not respond; as if permanent shock

had deadened me. And then after a moment

I began to give way to sorrow (watching myself
sorrowlessly the while), not merely because

part of my being had been violated and annulled,
but because all these many poems over the years
have been necessary,—-—suitable and correct. This
has been the time of the ﬁnishing off of the animals.
They are going away—their fur and their wild eyes,
their voices. Deer leap and leap in front

of the screaming snowmobiles until they leap

out of existence. Hawks circle once or twice

around their shattered nests and then they climb

to the stars. I have lived with them ﬁfty years,

we have lived with them ﬁfty million years,

and now they are going, almost gone. I don’t know
if the animals are capable of reproach.

But clearly they do not bother to say good-bye.

GIRAFFE

The offerings of the cliff are meager

and the taste of salt on boulders

whets your mouth into a breeze of spittle,
as your head rounds to the countryside
and advances, each reticulation

a wheat field sown in the heat

of other land.

Only a little farther

water glides in the chalk riverbed.

As you lower your head to drink,

past the shoulders,

down the long corridor of your tenuous,
simple legs,

that great burden of neck

driving your forehooves into the dirt,

it is like the onset of the humility

no one can live without.

JAN AND THE DEER

Han's hair and beard were still wet from swimming
when he told me, 'I caught a deer today,‘
and paused for me to ask him what he meant.

»While swimming with children from our preschool,
he saw a deer jump into the river,

chased by a dog, which also jumped in

and was overtaking her in the current

when he swam out and caught the deer himself.

I could picture Jan grinning through his black beard,
holding the doe upside-down by the ankles,

wading ashore to show her to the children-

He set her down and held her firmly while

they petted her and-pulled ticks from her hide.

He gestured, showing me how his arms were moved
each time she tried a powerful kick.

I could feel the energy in her legs

restrained by the muscles of his slow grip.

When he let go, with the children standing back,
she paused before bolting, and someone held

the dog long enough for her to escape.

Then they searched each other over for ticks.

We are so tolerant. The doe browses from bush to tree,

SHORE LINE

At the shore I compare my hand

to the starfish, slow and pliant
in the silt. I flatten my fingers
against its five identical spokes
crawling unencumbered

by wrist, arm or trunk.

We pay a price

for that branching long ago
when simple radial arm became
extension of the mind

instead of mindless limb.

The human hand, obedient

to all commands, grOpes,

closes and takes. But at night

it fidgets, creeping over smoothed
bedsheets with tube-footed stealth.
The pores open like air pocks in sand
and a salty wet slicks the skin

as if the hand,
glimpsing its origins,
wept for them.

STALKING THE FLORIDA PANTHER

Everglades National Park

Camped near fresh tracks, we wait.
Such blackness--the leafy horizon
closed shut like a fan.

The fire burns in whiSpers.
All night it has eaten itself
like a trapped animal

down to glowing red bones.
We lie on separate hummocks
in this river of grass,

the water moving
as stealthily as I imagine
the cat--its plush paws

dimpling the black muck
as it hunts. What I know:
that desire spreads like light

without doctrine. By morning
the sawgrass will shatter
the swamp to a million

glittering shards. Now,
moving for each other
in the darkness, our skin shines

like flares. I want to think
the cat is watching as our bodies
pull the wilderness in.

 




TURTLE

Paddling in two feet of ice melt

between the bank and the lake's white core,

a little snapper

poked its beaked nose under the dock,

pushed at moldering leaves on the bottom,

searching for something. Unpreturbed

by frigid water, by an approaching stranger, it hung there
on the cusp of the netherworld,

big webbed feet stroking slowly.

I knelt down at the water's edge and

saw its escape route—-a dark tunnel of water
under the ice. It didn't escape

but swam toward me,

placing front flippers on the bank near my feet.
I saw the curved black nails, graceful and tough.
It stretched its head—-so darkly damascened--
toward my face, neck lengthening until I saw

the pale hidden skin of the throat.

I saw the strain of its looking, black eyes

rolling toward me as I spoke in a soft voice.

Could it be lonely after a long winter?

Did it want food from me

or did curiosity hold it there?

Slowly it dipped back into the water and sank down,
merging with brown leaves, sunken

sticks until I could see only

surface reflections-—sky, trees, my face.

After years of seeking, this time
I was just there——

a gray day, nothing special——

and the lake, the cold, the deep
came to me.

 




 

TURTLES

A friend told this story about snapping turtles:

One lived in the lake below his house.

He saw it sometimes, lumbering through the shallows,
Hunting, morosely, for something to eat.

. A year later

He found a second turtle on a highway.

He brought it home and watched it

Crawl down the lawn. Unblinking, it entered the water.

3

Next morning: a splashing on the far shore.

He ran for his ﬁeld-glasses and looked:

In the ripples the two turtles were playing,
Mouthing and nuzzling, rolling over in the mud,
Their dank limbs hugging,

Like two bears honey—drunk, except

These were not bears but the thick reptile: turtle.

 

 

 

Later .
They swam away, and the surface of the water
Closed above them, shaking like ﬁre.

I eat no meat.

I break no leaf in idleness.

I listen to the rocks breathing
In the wet meadows.

6

When I heard this story, I said:

The dead have no eyes.

The dead can cherish nothing
But their own white bones.
That is what being dead is.

7

But there is a way, one,
To live forever.

 




WHALE WATCH

The clean sea rocks us small again.
Hushed, we wait,

hung with binoculars and telephoto lenses,
all the gear of second sight, scanning

for one plume of breath.

Out here we admit our longing.

Then they explode,

breaching and steaming like monumental facts--
big as moving vans, so close

we hear them suck and blow.

Bravo! we shout, gasping and clapping.
How beautiful they are

with their huge heads and mystical grins,
bodies scarred by ships' propellers,

old harpoons. They slap the waves and
dive deep, churning the sea to
whirlpools of turquoise foam.

I think we needed to see a creature
older, stronger, gentler than ourselves,
whose name means rolling,

who travels with the sea's own motion,
high white breath threading together
blue and deeper blue.

 




GIRAFFE

The offerings of the cliff are meager

and the taste of salt on boulders

whets your mouth into a breeze of spittle,
as your head rounds to the countryside
and advances, each reticulation

a wheat field sown in the heat

of other land.

Only a little farther

water glides in the chalk riverbed.

As you lower your head to drink,

past the shoulders,

down the long corridor of your tenuous,
simple legs,

that great burden of neck

driving your forehooves into the dirt,

it is like the onset of the humility

no one can live without.

The dead seal near McClure's Beach

I.

Walking north toward the point, I come on a dead
seal. From a few feet away, he looks like a brown
log. The body is on its back, dead only a few hours.

I stand and look at him. A quiver in the dead ﬂesh.
My God he is still alive. A shock goes through me, ‘
as if a wall of my room had fallen away.

His head is arched back, the small eyes closed,
the whiskers sometimes rise and fall. He is dying.
This is the oil. Here on its back is the oil that heats

: our houses so efficiently. Wind blows fine sand back
toward the ocean. The ﬂipper near me lies folded
over the stomach, looking like an unﬁnished arm,
lightly glazed with sand at the edges. The other
ﬂipper lies half underneath. The seal’s skin looks
like an old overcoat, scratched here and there . . .
by sharp mussels maybe . . .

I reach out and touch him. Suddenly he rears up,
turns over. He gives three cries, like those from
Christmas toys. He lunges toward me. I am terri-
ﬁed and leap back, although I know there can be
no teeth in thatjaw. He starts ﬂopping toward the
sea. But he falls over, on his face. He does not want
to go back to the sea. He looks up at the sky,
looks like an old lady who has lost her hair.

He puts his chin back down on the sand, arranges

his ﬂippers, and waits for me to go. I go.

and he

 




 

Today I go back to say goodbye; he’s dead now.
But he’s not—he’s a quarter mile farther up the
shore. Today he is thinner, squatting on his stom-
ach, head out. The ribs show more — each vertebra
on the back under the coat now visible, shiny. He
breathes in and out.

He raises himself up, and tucks his ﬂippers under,
as if to keep them warm. A wave comes in, touches
his nose. He turns and looks at me— the eyes slanted,
the crown of his head like a leather jacket. He is
taking a long time to die. The whiskers white as
porcupine quills, the forehead SIOpes, goodbye
brother, die in the sound of waves, forgive us if we
have killed you, long live your race, your inner-
tube race, so uncomfortable on land, so comfortable
in the sea. Be comfortable in death then, where the
sand will be out of your nostrils, and you can swim
in long loops through the pure death, ducking un-
der as assassinations break above you. You don’t
want to be touched by me. I climb the cliff and go
home the other way.

Calling Ravens

The first irreverent sound is like a broken-toe

cry in the dark, but it is morning

and the playful shadow circling

signals the ravens' return to Roane Mountain.

I lift my head from my sleeping bag and scream back
to see if the raven will turn and answer.

The bird answers out of curiosity. He'd like to know
what creature would call a raven so crudely.

From the air I must look like I am being swallowed

by a large blue caterpillar. Three more ravens

join to see the feeding as I pull the mummy bag

over my head and barely peer out with eye and nose.
My breath smokes in the mountain air; the ravens all
scream to coax me into making my noise.

So I call again a little too shrill

and they recognize me, become bored

and fly away batting and nudging each other in raven joy.
Quite awake now, I think about hot coffee and watch
the sun rise above mulitple mountain humps

where there must be thousands of ravens screaming,

flirting in the brisk air and this thought is broken
by more shadows tracing the mountain contour.

I blurt out a shrill cry which sends a puff of steam
drifting like a small cloud into the air.

They do not answer.

 




WILD HORSES

They graze under a full moon

up country in Carson Forest.
Unlike tame horses who lie down
in stalls, they sleep all night
under the stars, tails giving

-an occasional flip against flies.
They don't know how old they are,
or that winter is always coming,
or that somewhere there are

bins of grain and bales of hay.

At night when I turn into my own
driveway, with the lights of cities
only miles away, I think I hear
wild horses gallop on the dry

river bed. Red flags quiver

in their nostrils when they run.
They move so fast, I can't

see their washboard ribs.

Often I lie with my eyes Open
hoping to see the watering hole
where wild horses drink,
sucking the good water

between their teeth.

 

 




they tound in back
two dozen cages ﬁlled ,
with fat and drowsing tailless rattlesnakes.

CROSS FOX

Band of black across his shoulders
band of black along his back

the only stranger born into a litter
of red brothers and sisters

eyes bright, but his brighter

with another knowledge.

This is the one the breeders sought

the one whose blood would have brought forth
in the Fur Farm cages a rainbow of colors,
platinum, silver, costly gold.

This is the fox who was not caught.

The cross he carries on his back

is the four directions of this land,

the ways the People of the Dawn knew,
ways of the four winds and not the ﬁgure
held in carved agony, the dying god.

Living, he carries his cross
from the Earth

he was born in

back to the Earth.

He will not die in the air.

ZEBRA

The eagle’s shadow runs across the plain,

Towards the distant, nameless, air-blue mountains.

But the shadows of the round young Zebra

Sit close between their delicate hoofs all day,
where they stand immovable,

And wait for the evening, wait to stretch out, blue,

Upon a plain, painted brick-red by the sunset,

And to wander to the water-hole.

THE JAGUAR

The apes yawn and adore their ﬂeas in the sun.
The parrots shriek as if they were on ﬁre, or strut
Like cheap tarts to attract the stroller with the nut.
Fatigued with indolence, tiger and lion

Lie still as the sun. The boa-constrictor's coil
Is a fossil. Cage after cage seems empty, or
Stinks of sleepers from the breathing straw.

It might be painted on a nursery wall.

But who runs like the rest past these arrives

At a cage where the crowd stands, stares, mesmerized,
As a child at a dream, at ajaguar hurrying enraged
Through prison darkness after the drills of his eyes

On a short ﬁerce fuse. Not in boredom—

The eye satisﬁed to be blind in ﬁre,

By the hang of blood in the brain deaf the car—-
He spins from the bars, but there’s no cage to him

More than to the visionary his cell:

His stride is wildernesses of freedom:

The world rolls under the long thrust of his heel.
Over the cage ﬂoor the horizons come.

 

 

 

 




Children of the Tides

Young sea otters plunder
the waves
trailing
green boas, exploring the edges
of kelp beds, diving wherever they hear
the ear—shaped mollusk open and shut
his mysterious mouth
around a delicious word.
They lunch on their backs, a picnic
spread on wet fur, a silk tablecloth,
a stone in the paw to tap Open
abalone's home or scan
the length of sea—urchin spines.
Their noses whisker the water.
Skirting the North Pacific shore
down mountains of sun
they tumble,

secure in their supple lives.

Rare fur,
so few of their small tribe
survive the nightmare of driftnets,
the widening slick of big oil.

Riding the tides of extinction

till their last whiskered cries are gone

they play out
the wily old Sea—Otter Song.

-—Jean Pearson

 




KINSHIPS

1. On Safari

 

From Serengeti we took the back way
to Narok. The map was bad,

the rental car rocked in and out
of pot—holes full of ochre dust.
It clogged our throats. Behind
shut port-holes a landscape dull
as ocean rolled along.

No other car in sight for hours
except once an old lorry

roared past us in a flurry

of grit. And was gone.

Then the car limped, staggered:
a tire's gone flat. the men
began to wrestle with the spare.

Immensity of quiet begins

to fill now With the skein

of sounds that are always present.
Stir of grasses, flutter of wings
as weaver-birds dash

back and forth in the acacias.
Insect voices lacing the air.

The drum of the sky humming,
announcing some arrival...

And four giraffes come pacing
silently towards us across the veldt.
They bow, they lift their innocent
bony heads, drifting slow

as ships. Long purple tongues

from time to time snake out

to savor a leaf. Tranquil eyes
with.those long childish lashes

gaze at us in mild surprise.

With the slightest of gestures

(flick of an ear, twitch of a muscle
along a shoulder) as if

to shrug off some insect, they
acknowledge this small intrusion

into their perfect world. Funny,

such stunted_beings. And their shell,
that smells of metal death,

for once so oddly still...

 




JOY TO THE FISHES

I hiked out to the end of Sunset Cliffs
& climbed the breakwater,

sneakers strung over my shoulder ’
& a small collection of zen

poems in my ﬁst.

A minnow

that had sloshed out of someone’s baitbucket,

& that I came within an inch of stepping on,
convulsed in agony.
Delighted to assist,

I tossed it back into its ocean:

swirling eddies sucked about the rocks,
white pythagorean sailboats

in the middle distance.

Kids raced the surf,

a labrador brought down a frisbee,

8: the sun sank pendulously

over the Paciﬁc shelf.

I shivered 8: descended,

slipping the unopened book

into my pocket '

8r walked south

along the southern California coastline——
all the hills of Ocean Beach

glowing

in the rouged light
of midwinter sunset.

Even now

it pleases me to think

that somewhere

in the western coastal waters off America
that minnow is still swimming.
