Dr. Gentle . . . goes on to describe how, although partially

normal shape, an extensive scar tissue remains, adjacent to which
damaged and regenerating nerve fibres form extensive neuromas.
[Neuroma: a painful proliferating mass that may develop at the

Dr. Gentle concludes: ’The close similarity between birds and

mammals in their physiological and behavioural response to

painful stimuli would argue for a common sensory and emotional
experience and it is therefore essential that the ethical
considerations normally afforded to mammals should be extended to

birds.’"

Dear Supporter, May 1991

We were impressed by the tremendous concern for welfare shown in April’s Poultry World. A
few years ago, references to welfare matters in that publication were nil - now the subject 18 almost
an obsession! At last, the welfare movement’s message has sunk in, not least in the mind of the
Director General of the International Egg Commission (see fact 585). We’re glad that he appreciates
the importance of satisfactory alternative systems! Certainly, some of the apologies for free range,
and the overstocked percheries supplying supermarkets with "barn eggs", are nothing like good
enough. ,

Sadly, on the morning of April 27th, Boyo (who features on the enclosed postcards) was found
dead. He had seemed on excellent form (by his standards) the previous day, so we believe he
suffered a heart attack, due to his appalling built-in obesity. He was inscrutable (it would be
presumptuous to form conclusions about what was going on in his mind, or what the wise expression
in his eyes signiﬁed) but we think "timid and totally unaggressive" is a fair description. But he took
his role as guardian of the poultry run very seriously, his gobble resounding impressively around this
little valley. "Majestic" was the word that sprung to mind when he ﬂuffed out his feathers to impress
onlookers (which he never failed to do!). However, Boyo was a travesty of what a turkey should be.
In their wild state, turkeys can ﬂy at 50mph, yet Boyo was only able to plod along at snail’s pace,
barely able to lift his feet off the ground. Before burying him, we weighed him and he registered
50le - around 31/2 stone. Horriﬁcally, many male breeding turkeys are even heavier, reaching the
651b mark (and remember the obscene ‘Heavy Turkey’ competition, when the 1989 winner tipped the
scales at 851bs 14 ozs). Presumably this is because breeders are selected for their huge size (Boyo
was perhaps something of a runt). ‘Yet these birds are slaughtered by a combination of electric shock
(which may or may not be successful-see facts 550-558) and neck cutting, while hung upside down in
painfully constricting shackles. They may, by law, be suspended for up to 6 minutes (and who can
doubt it’s sometimes longer?) Imagine the strain on their legs and hip joints (frequently diseased in
these older birds) and the scene becomes intolerable. Imagine too the stress, pain and indignity of the
artiﬁcial insemination procedures, upon which the modern turkey industry is totally reliant. Turkeys
are highly sensitive to shocks of any kind. When Boyo died, the two females huddled together in a
state of apparent panic for some hours. (Hens, in our experience, take not the slightest notice if one
of their ﬂock mates dies amongst them). All in all, the turkey industry of the 19905 is a disgrace in a
supposedly civilised society. Yet to the general public turkey meat is still a clean, white, sanitised
product, with a "bootiful" image. (Have you noticed how Bernard Matthews poses for the press
standing among a little ﬂock of free range turkeys?) WE MUST CHANGE THIS IMAGE. We
enclose two postcards of Boyo. Please use one as you wish, but do send the other (or write a letter)
to : THE DIRECTOR, THE BRITISH TURKEY FEDERATION, HIGH HOLBORN HOUSE,
52-4, HIGH HOLBORN, LONDON WC1V, 68X expressing your feelings about these monstrously
over-weight birds, and/or the horriﬁc methods of slaughter. (Don’t forget to put your address, or he
will have every excuse not to reply!). Boyo is now buried near the poultry orchard. We intend to
plant a tree (something majestic - perhaps a chestnut or oak) in his memory. We had him for a year,
and have gained much from knowing him: a magniﬁcent photograph which we are using to great
effect, and an education in turkey behaviour, which is both strange and interesting. In welfare terms,
Boyo’s life has, we believe, been of great signiﬁcance. The valley seems quiet now, and we shall
miss his presence.

Fact sheet 29 is rather long, but, we hope, full of interest. We’re very concerned about the

 




abuse of antibiotics on factory farms. Please read facts 588-595 and write to your MP (House of
Commons, London SW1A 0AA) expressing your concern at this hazard to HUMAN health. We
suggest you question the wisdom and safety of Bayer UK receiving an ATC when ‘the over-use . of
enrofloxacin in the Netherlands has apparently resulted in a highly dangerous Situation. We realize
this is a tricky subject for non-scientists, but not really one beyond our comprehens1on, and certainly
one which should concern us all. A sample letter to your MP might run: "Dear , I am
concerned that unhealthy conditions within the intensive poultry industry have led to the dangerous
mis—use of antibiotics. I understand that Bayer UK has been issued with an animal test certiﬁcate to
try out the antibiotic enroﬂoxacin on poultry, yet this very drug is suspected of having resulted in
ciproﬂoxacin - resistant strains of campylobacter spp in the Netherlands. Scientists writing in The
Lancet are questioning whether enroﬂoxacins should be administrated at all, to animals. I should
welcome your views on the very widespread use, or mis-use, of antibiotics in modern animal
husbandry, which is apparently leading to serious infections in humans becoming resistant to some
antibiotics. Yours sincerely, etc" If possible, vary this suggested letter, using facts 588-595 as
back-up. But better by far to copy our sample letter word for word than not write at all! We suggest
you address and stamp that envelope and postcard NOW, and write the letter and card at the ﬁrst
opportunity. The anitibiotics issue IS directly related to animal welfare, since it’ s the squalid
conditions endured by so many of Britain’s farm animals that has necessitated the massive over-use of
drugs, most of which should be reserved for life-and—death situations in human medicine.

This Easter we returned to Chelford market (in Cheshire) where last year we bought our
turkeys. Stricter market regulations (The Welfare of Animals at Markets Order 1990, No. 2628)
meant that all cages were supplied with straw. This time no turkeys were on sale, but MAFF cannot
assure us that this will be the case in future. (Cages at Chelford are totally unsuitable for large birds).
We were able to buy ﬁfteen end-of-lay hens. Quite well-feathered, they were mostly severly
debeaked (see fact 597) with dull and listless plumage. The legs of one were covered in blood, from
open sores. Once home, we were able to watch this little hen learning to walk. Picking up each foot
much higher than necessary, she was clearly experiencing the sensation of making physical progress
for the very ﬁrst time. All soon learned to scratch around in the straw-ﬁlled pens we provided, and
after a few days they were transferred to three different homes, to live out their natural lives on free
range.

Our proposed new battery hen poster is still not with us, due to some disappointments when
trying to obtain suitable photographs for it. But be assured we have not forgotten it. (Ideally, we like
to use new photographs for new publicity, but this may not be possible).

Our grateful thanks to all of you who continue to support us in so many ways. Please do keep
sending newspaper cuttings (dated, and with the address of the paper when it’s local to you) and other
items of interest. While we cannot always acknowledge them, we act upon them whenever possible,
sometimes to good effect. Thanks too for keeping the petitions coming in. We are now running a
joint one with CIWF (sample enclosed) so please help us with this (more forms available on request).
Our petition to the PM is being wound up, but completed forms are still most welcome up to the end
of June. The M&S petition is on—going till we see results! As ever, your kind ﬁnancial support is not
merely much appreciated, but vital! (Though we don’t send receipts for sums under £10, unless
requested, we are of course very grateful for any donations, however small). Please do make use of
Audrey Eyton’s wonderful book (details on separate slip) which we’re sure is bound to have a
far-reaching effect, for the good of all abused farm animals. We hope to see some of you at the
L1v1ng Without Cruelty exhibition in June. Meanwhile, please do write the suggested letters, and
remember we are always interested to see copies of the replies you receive.

.We’re sure you would be encouraged to see our in-coming post. Much is from children,
gathering information for school projects (who could have imagined this ten years ago?) and a typical
week might include letters from Poland, Brazil, America and Australia. We are noticing feed-back
_ from our fact sheets from all over the world, and this is most encouraging. We are convinced that evil

systems topple once the truth about them is revealed. Progress may seem slow, but we sense it is
sure.

FACT SHEET 29 MAY 1991

These information sheets are issued by Chickens’ Lib. Chickens’ Lib is a non—violent pressure
group dedicated to the total abolition of battery cages and any other systems for poultry keeping
which impose severe restrictions on the birds, depriving them of a reasonably natural hfe-style.

Abbreviations: CL = Chickens’ Lib. PW = Poultry World. NS = New Scientist. FG = Farmer’s
Guardian. FR = Free Range.

Please note! Chickens’ Lib used to offer complete sets of fact sheets, dating back to 1982. These
were valuable for anyone wanting detailed information, but unfortunately we are now unable to
compile complete sets, as all master copies (up to and including fact sheet number 25) were
destroyed, when ﬁre gutted the duplicating company we had used for many years. Our booklet
INTENSIVE EGG, CHICKEN AND TURKEY PRODUCTION (£1 inc. p&p) serves as an update
and a precis of all previous fact sheets. Further copies of fact sheets 26 onwards, and photocopies
of speciﬁc facts will still be available on request. Numbers in brackets refer to earlier facts, which
will be of interest to those who have kept previous fact sheets.

THE EGG INDUSTRY

GLEADTHORPE FAILS TO SEE THE LIGHT - ALONG WITH THE HENS

585) Trials have been taking place at Gleadthorpe, MAFF’S poultry research and development
farm in Nottinghamshire, using different lighting intensities for battery egg production. Three
intensities are being tried out — 0.5 lux, 2.0 lux and 5.0 lux. "The trials seemed to indicate there is
no problem with light intensity and, providing there is enough light to inspect the birds, the light
could possibly be dimmer than has previously been thought necessary to support maximum rate of
lay," concluded Andrew Walker, Gleadthorpe poultry adviser. He admitted that light intensity has
"serious consequences for bird welfare", both from the point of view of low levels making
inspections difficult and high levels encouraging aggression in the birds. (FG 29 3 91) CL regrets
the fact that poultry scientists at Gleadthorpe are not more enlightened themselves (0.5 lux is
EXTREMELY dim). The welfare movement, and ultimately consumers, will refuse to support
systems which operate without due regard for farm animals’ behavioural needs. Fred Drew,
Director General of the International Egg Commission, summed up the situation when addressing
the Northern Poultry Conference earlier this year: "It is an insult to the intelligence of your
consumers to assume that this (the claim that research has shown that the welfare of hens is no
better under alternative systems - Ed.) will make cages more acceptable. THEY WANT RID OF
CAGES AND IF ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS PROVE LESS THAN SATISFACTORY THEY
WILL WANT RID OF THEM TOO UNTIL A SYSTEM THAT MEETS THEIR
REQUIREMENTS IS FOUND. ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT NO ONE HAS TO EAT EGGS."
(CL’s capitals) (PG 15 3 91)

DAN GERS WITHIN THE INTENSIVE POULTRY INDUSTRY

586) The Control of Substances Hazardous to Health regulations (COSHH) came into force on
October lst 1989. Here are three examples of hazards encountered by poultry workers: "Ammonia
is a gas which can be detected by smell, but some workers have a poor sense of smell or may have
become accustomed to a heavy ammonia atmosphere...Forma1dehyde gas is used for fumigating
eggs, buildings and hatcheries. It can be dangerous and is also suspected of being carcinogenic at
certain levels of exposure...Dust is considered a potential hazard in poultry establishments. It can
arise from poultry skin, feathers, feed, dry litter, nest material and micro organisms."
(Poultryview, 1990, Dalgety Agriculture Ltd.) CL believes that suggestions for supplying battery
hens with dust bathing facilities are ill-conceived. The dry dusty atmosphere in battery units (463)
already causes asthma and bronchial troubles in some poultry workers. The problem would be
made infinitely worse by the addition of the clouds of dust (from whatever material) which would
arise as a result of hens taking a dust bath. NB The Health and Safety Executive is attempting to
protect workers, but no protection is offered to the birds, who may remain in adverse conditions
for long periods. Ammonia blindness is a painful condition caused by high levels of ammonia:
"Levels of up to 15—20 ppm are acceptable. If levels go over 40 ppm there may be some reduction
in food intake but if levels go over 50 ppm there may also be irritation of the conjunctiva and
respiratory tract, resulting in conjunctivitis, keratitis and even blindness and exacerbation of

 




respiratory infections." (Poultry Diseases, T.T.W. Jordan, Department of Veterinary Pathology,
University of Liverpool.)

587) "In a recent study on the effect of husbandry systems on the incidence. of broken bonesin
laying hens, it was found that 25% of birds kept in perchery systems acquired fractures which
subsequently healed with calciﬁcation (Gregory and others 1990). This proportlon was
unexpectedly high, and since it was greater than that observed in battery ﬂocks It was thought that
the fractures were associated with ﬂight and landing accidents within the perchery units." (NB
Gregory, L]. Wilkins, VR 16 2 91) In an attempt to put this ﬁgure into perspective, 204 dead
pigeons were obtained from the Pest Control Department of the Corporation of the City of Br1stol.
Some were ex—racing pigeons, and some feral. It was found that 5% of the pigeons had old
fractures, with a slightly greater incidence among the feral birds. It was also established (Gregory
and others 1990) that 12% of free range hens and 5% of battery birds suffered broken bones. (CL
considers that precise details of the free range conditions should be included in reports, since much
present day FR egg production is essentially intensive, with very large numbers of birds kept in
percheries with access to range which is not always well-used by the birds. It seems likely that FR
birds from small units, run along traditional lines, would fare better.) NB The low incidence of
breaks in battery hens’ bones reﬂects the immobility of the caged birds. Once removed from cages,
caught and transported to slaughter, battery hens show the highest incidence of broken bones (489).
The study of perchery hens by Gregory and Wilkins highlights the unsatisfactory nature of a
system which can cause such a high percentage of fractures. CL is concerned that stocking
densities are much too high in many perchery systems resulting in aggressive behaviour in the
birds. NB Eggs produced in these conditions are usually marketed as ‘Barn Eggs’. ASDA’s
advertising leaflet states: "Barn Eggs are laid by hens which are housed in warm, dry barns. They
are free to move indoors, at all times, performing natural activities such as feeding, resting and
nesting". (EC Egg Marketing Regulations permit 25 birds/m2 with a minimum of 15 cm perch
space per bird — ASDA informed CL in January 1991 that its suppliers adhere to this stocking
density, but ASDA is working towards a more generous one.) NB "Barn" is often a euphemism for
an ex—battery shed, denuded of cages.

ANTIBIOTICS - PROPPING UP THE SICK INTENSIVE POULTRY INDUSTRIES

588) " Although antibiotics are not usually helpful in acute salmonella gastroenteritis the quinolone
agent ciproﬂoxacin signiﬁcantly shortens the duration of symptoms and of faecal excretion of
salmonellae. Ciproﬂoxacin might therefore be useful in the control of hospital outbreaks." (Letter

589) "In 1989 we noticed a rise in the frequency of isolation of ciproﬂoxacin—resistant strains of
Campylobacter spp, and this prompted us to look at campylobacter strains isolated between 1982
and 1989. Because quinolones (ciproﬂoxacin, norﬂoxacin and enroﬂoxacin are all examples of
these antibiotics-Ed.) had been introduced into veterinary practice we also looked for ciproﬂoxacin
resistance in strains isolated from poultry products...In 1982-83 no human or chicken strain was
resistant to ciproﬂoxacin while from 1987-89 resistance became quite common...Although it cannot
be excluded that the use of norﬂoxacin in human medicine led to the development of quinolone
resistance in campylobacter it seems more probable that the administration of enroﬂoxacin in
poultry is signiﬁcant. If large—scale use of quinolones in veterinary medicine does lead to a rapid
increase in resistance among campylobacter, the use of these drugs for treatment (of severe
infections in humans - Ed.) ...will meet with failure, so our ﬁndings may have important clinical
implications." (The Lancet, vol. 335, 31 3 90 p.787) NB In 1989 veterinary sales of enroﬂoxacin
in the Netherlands amounted to 50% of the sales of all ﬂuoroquinolones in human medicine in that
country. (Campylobacter causes an acute form of food poisoning which can mimic appendicitis,
and may result in reactive arthritis. It is a leading cause of death in children under two years in

Third World countries. Around 50% of raw chickens in the UK are contaminated by the
campylobacter bug.)

AND BAD NEWS FROM THE UK

590) "...an animal test certiﬁcate (ATC) has recently been issued permitting enroﬂoxacin (Baytril
10 per cent oral solution; Bayer) to be used under controlled conditions in turkeys, chickens,
plgeons and psittacine birds." (VR 30 3 91, letter from J.M. Rutter, Veterinary Medicines

 




Directorate, Weybridge, Surrey.) Since Bayer has an ATC for enrofloxacin it is permitted to
conduct trials of the drug on a commercial basis. Poultry veterlnarlans w111 contact Bayer when a
‘suitable’ outbreak of disease occurs in a client’s flock and the drug IS tested, to assess 1ts efﬁcacy.

591) "There has lately been interest in the use of quinolones to treat patients with salmonella
infections. One outstanding issue is the emergence of resistance." (Letter to The LancetZ vol. 335,
16 6 90, p. 1459 from the departments of Medical Microbiology and Microbiology in Birmingham
and Manchester’s Monsall Hospital.)

592) "Thought needs to be given as to whether quinolones, such as enrofloxacin, should be given
to animals." (Letter to The Lancet, vol. 336, 14 7 90, p. 125 from Blrmmgham Un1vers1ty,
Birmingham’s Dudley Road Hospital, and MAFF’s Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybrldge.

FOOTNOTE TO FACTS 588 - 592 .
593) After administration to animals and poultry, enroﬂoxacin is altered to become ciproﬂoxacm,
so the use of enroﬂoxacin in animals and poultry can cause an increase in ciproﬂoxacin-resistant
bacteria that can spread to man.

594) "Resistance to trimethroprim is worrying because cotrimoxazole is an efﬁcient and
inexpensive alternative for the treatment of typhoid fever due to chloramphenical—resistant
Salmonella typhi." (Letter to The Lancet, vol. 336, 28 7 90, p. 252) NB trimethroprim is widely
used in the broiler and turkey industries to combat a range of diseases including coli septicaemia,
coccidiosis, salmonella and fatty liver and kidney syndrome.

595) CL DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT ALL VETERINARY DRUGS ARE DANGEROUS OR
UNDESIRABLE BUT BELIEVES THAT SYSTEMS OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY THAT
PROMOTE ILL-HEALTH, BECAUSE OF OVER-CROWDING, LACK OF FRESH AIR ETC.
ARE TO BE CONDEMNED. NO MAN IS AN ISLAND WHEN IT COMES TO

#596) 406-410). 'Although acute pain is important to the animal, it is chronic pain which may last
for” wee gm onths or even years which presents a major welfare problem...Partial amputation of
the beak is common agricultural practice and involves the partial removal of the upper and/or
lower beak in order to prevent or control feather pecking and cannibalism in intensively reared
poultry... It seems likely... that for the ﬁrst few hours after amputation the birds experience a
pain-free period similar to that sometimes experienced by humans following major trauma (Ty et

a1. 1984). By approximately 24 hours after amputation the birds were showing pain related
behavioural changes with the birds unwilling to peck at the environment, reduced food and water ,
intake together with long periods of sitting and dozing. The behaviour of the bird changes over the
next 6 weeks and food and water intake increases up to the preoperative levels. A number of
behavioural patterns do not however change and the bird shows a reluctance to use the beak for
unessential activities such as exploratory environmental pecking, head shaking, beak wiping,
preening (Gentle et a1. 1990). This reduced usage of the beak can be interpreted as guarding
behaviour so commonly seen in humans and other mammals following painful injuries. Dozing and
general inactivity were observed by Eskeland (1981) in birds OVER A 56 WEEK OBSERVATION

disturbing to watch, nevertheless suggest that the birds (both very young ch1cks and adult layers are
shown being debeaked) are relatively unconcerned immediately after the mutllatlon, but Dr.
Gentle’s research indicates that much future suffering is in store for them. CL has brought batches
of debeaked hens whose plumage has been dull and soiled with dried-on faeces. Clearly, these
birds have stopped preening themselves because of chronic discomfort caused by beak mutllation.
SYSTEMS WHICH RELY ON DEBEAKING TO REDUCE FEATHER LOSS AND
CANNIBALISM ARE INHUMANE AND, BY THEIR VERY NATURE, ILLEGAL. Causing
pain and suffering to poultry is prohibited under the 1911 Protection of Animals Act and the
Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968. Around 80% of turkeys and large numbers of
l broiler breeders and laying hens (from all systems) are debeaked in the UK.

THEORIES EXPLODED

598) In the past, MAFF has informed CL that the degree of feather loss in battery hens may be due
to a number of factors, including environmental temperature, while farmers often claim that battery
hens "don’t need their feathers" since battery units are so comfortably warm. In fact, hens kept
under any system where stress (from overcrowding, boredom and deprivation) leads to feather
pecking lose feathers, but the ambient temperature is not the point at issue. (Battery hens can also
lose and damage their own feathers through contact with the harsh cage environment.) Research by
Dr. Michael Gentle at the AFRC Institute of Animal Physiology and Genetics Research, Edinburgh
Research Station, Roslin, indicates that feather removal by other birds is "likely to be painful to the
bird and feather removal by ﬂockmates can be categorised as a welfare problem". Dr. Gentle
states: "Feather pecking is commonly found in intensively reared poultry yet birds being feather
pecked show little or no behavioural responses to indicate that the removal of feathers is painful
and will stand or sit while other birds remove feathers and inﬂict severe skin lesions with no
outward sign of response." However, the apparent absence of pain/fear is misleading. Feather
follicles are sensitive to pain: "The follicular wall of the feather is richly supplied with general
somatic afferent (sensory) ﬁbres and nerves are present in the papilla, pulp and feather muscles
(Lucas and Stettenheim 1972)." An initial display of discomfort is replaced, in the event of further
feather loss, by behaviour described as "the conservation—withdrawal system" whereby birds
change from being "alert and active" to a state of "crouching immobility". Despite this immobility,
the birds’ blood pressure rises, and their heart rates show marked changes with every feather
removal. COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE HAVE NEEDED NO PROOF TO CONVINCE
THEMSELVES THAT BIRDS THAT LOOK CRUELLY ABUSED, AS DO MANY
END-OF-LAY HENS, HAVE SUFFERED. Scientiﬁc proof is now available to support their
views, and can be used to counter arguments based on ignorance or expediency. On farms where
the behavioural needs of hens are not met, the choice is seen to be between debeaking the hens or

reckoning on a high incidence of feather pecking (the third option being very low lighting levels -
see fact 585).

SALMONELLA ENTERITIDIS PT4 - THE CHICKEN AND THE EGG

599) "Between May and July, 1990, the sixteen laboratories in the Public Health Laboratory
Service (PHLS) Food Chain undertook a survey of the incidence of salmonella in raw, chilled, and
frozen whole chicken. The chickens were obtained from retail premises, including supermarkets,
freezer centres, butchers’ shops, grocers, and farm shops. Most chickens were produced in the
UK; 6 (3 frozen, 3 chilled) were imported from other European countries...292 (146 chilled, 146
frozen) chickens were examined...The earlier studies showed that raw chicken was frequently
contaminated with salmonellae, and a wide range of serotypes was found although the rate of
contamination of retail chicken with salmonella seems to have fallen, ISOLATIONS OF S.
ENTERITIDIS PHAGE TYPE (PT) 4 HAVE INCREASED CONSIDERABLY IN THE LAST
DECADE, FROM ZERO IN 1978-80 TO 16% IN 1987 AND 21% IN THE RECENT SURVEY.
S. ENTERITIDIS PT4 IS THUS WELL ESTABLISHED IN UK BROILER CHICKENS (CL’s
capitals). Of the 6 imported chickens, 5 contained salmonellae but none was S enteritidis PT4.
Examination of a larger number of imported birds is planned. " (Letter to The Lancet, vol. 337, 20
4 91, p. 984 from Diane Roberts of the PHLS Food Hygiene Laboratory, CPHL, London) The

 




steep rise in S enteritidis PT4 (from 0% in 1978/80 to 21% in 1990) indicates that chicken in its raw
or insufﬁciently cooked state presents a serious health hazard (at all stages until thoroughly cooked)
since this strain of salmonella can cause acute, and sometimes fatal, food poisoning in humans. The
egg industry is keen to lay the blame on imported eggs, when the question of salmonella food
poisoning from eggs arises. Contaminated imported eggs, especially from Holland, have been found
in recent months, and the bulk of these (despite being infected with salmonella) consignments have
been sold to UK consumers. With chickens, it appears from this survey that UK birds are highly
contaminated. (Examination of a larger, and therefore more representative, number of imported
chickens is planned by the PHLS Food Chain Laboratories.) CL believes that health hazards of
various kinds will continue to threaten animals and humans as long as farming methods keep ammals
in close conﬁnement. The beneﬁts of fresh air. sunshine and exercise are not exclusive to humankind
and stress is known to make humans and animals alike more susceptible to disease.

DALGEY AGRICULTURE LTD. HIGHLIGHTS SUFFERING IN BROILER PARENT STOCK
600) "During the rearing stages, birds on the return end of the feed track are often under-weight due
to the track being partially emptied on its circuit...There is some dislike of using grids or grills on
top of feed troughs for separate sex feeding (503) of males and females because females tend to get
their heads trapped and then refuse to feed...Ey putting small blocks of wood. . .in front of
partitions. . .young chicks which would usually be trapped at these points come up against the movable
block and are able to escape...There is a growing feeling that beak trimming of females should cease
if possible~although males will still have to be debeaked. By getting the temperature down to 70°F by
three weeks of age and dimming lights more than normal, it is definitely possible to dispense with
debeamng." (FOULTEYVIEW 1990, issued by Dalgety Agriculture Ltd.) This miscellany of welfare
problems (all associated with broiler breeder stock) is disturbing and confirms accounts given to CL
on many occasions about broiler chickens becoming trapped in automatic equipment in broiler sheds.
In view of the pain of debeaking (596) and the danger of suffering passing unnoticed in conditions of
low light intensity, the alternative for broiler breeders of being debeaked or living in extreme gloom
is a cruel one.

LIGHT AT “1: E END OF THE POLYTUNNEL FOE BROKERS?

601) The ﬁrst birds from the Pauls Agriculture/Lloyd Maunder free range operation went to market
in July W90. Mortality in the birds, which were slaughtered at eleven weeks of age (having spent six
weeks on range) was 4.2%, compared with the average of around 6% in 6-7week old birds reared in
intensive broiler sheds. On the Devon farm of Peter Coleman §,000 birds were reared in a polythene
tunnel (made up of a sandwich of two layers of polythene and insulating material for protection from
cold and heat) with a generous number of popholes onto the range. PW reported John Cessford,
Paul’s poultry product manager, to be "over the moon" about initial results: "We are very
encouraged at the way it is going. We’ve got the full allocation of 26 houses for the phase one and
everyone is very enthusiastic...l’m delighted that people are taking such an interest in the project."
The polytunnels are classiﬁed as portable by local planners and "could attract tax advantages if they
were leased". (PW August 1990) The breeds used are ‘unspeciﬁed’ but resemble the slow-growing
French strains. ASDA has launched its conservation Grade FR Chicken and the good news is that this
too is a slow-growing bird, derived from the Cornish hen. THE MODERN BROILER, THE
RESULT OF DECADES OF RUTHLESS GENETIC SELECTION FOR ’MEATINESS’ AND
QUICK GROWTH (SO BIGGER PROFITS), IS A DISASTER IN CHICKEN WELFARE TERMS,
AND MUST BE PHASED OUT.

CORRECTION
602) In fact 575 we stated that TESCO food stores are planning to stop selling battery eggs within the
next 5 years. Apparently this is not the case.

OSTRICH FARMING - THE LATEST.
603) The Farm Animal Welfare Council (the independent body set up to advise MAFF) is to look
into the question of ostrich farming in the UK.

 




IMPORTANT. . .IMPORTANT. . IMPORTANT. . IMPORTANT

March saw the launch of an important book. THE
KIND FOOD GUIDE by Audrey Eyton (author of the
best-selling The F-Plan Diet’) is certain to be an
invaluable tool for all those who care about animals
reared for food. If you eat meat/f1sh/poultry/eggs/dairy
products it will guide you in an admirably clear way to
the kindest’ of these, naming supermarkets and other
sources supplying non factory- -farmed food.
Alternatively, if you are a vegetarian/vegan and don’t
need this advice yourself, it will make a marvellous
present for friends and relations and is unlikely to
offend or annoy anyonelYoung vegetar1ans/ vegans
whose parents may not wish to go along with their
beliefs can buy it in the hope that at least kinder’ food
may in future grace the family table. There’s a wealth of
information for those who want it, yet it’s quite possible
to make use of the guide while avoiding upsetting
details of cruel methods of production. Wittily written,
with a light touch (despite the passionate concern for
food animals clearly felt by the author) we recommend
it highly. (Penguin Books, £3. 99- all author’s royalties

APRIL 1991

 

PRESS RELEASE

 

In Delhi, on April 18, 1991, Ms. Maneka Gandhi,
Minister of State for Environment and Forests, Ministry
of Environment and Forests (Government of India) set
the torch to Rs.70,00,000 (US$3,50,000) worth of animal

furs and skins.

The Bonfire was organised by Beauty Without
Cruelty (BWC) in collaboration with the Chief Wildlife
Warden (CWW), Delhi and the Ministry Of Environment and

Forests.

Sometime ago the Ministry had requested all
State Wildlife Wardens to destroy seized items in stock
with them, but to date only damaged and disintegrating
items had been disposed off. Now for the very first
time in India, usable, confiscated, wildlife items went

up in smoke.

Reactions to the Bonfire have not all been favour—

able. First and foremost, certain important persons

AFFILIATED ORGANISATIONS

AN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATIONAL CHARITABLE TRUST
Donations exempted under Section BOG of IT. Act 1961 .

 




wanted to know "if a poor country like ours could afford
to destroy such valuable stocks". The answer is: Yes,
it can — does India not destroy confiscated drugs of

much higher value?

In addition to this, there have been others

who have strongly objected in the media, calling the

Bonfire a gimmick and feeling that such beautiful wildlife
items should not have been destroyed. At the same time
lstating that people should be persuaded to stop using

such cruel products!

Beauty Without Cruelty feels that the Bonfire
has proved to be a sincere commitment for the preserva—
tion of India's wildlife. If these confiscated items
are again put up for sale, in India or abroad, the very

purpose of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 would

be defeated.

Beauty Without Cruelty hopes that in future

animal rights activists will voluntarily come forward

and destroy animal products they own. It is the best

 




BeautyWithout Cruelty

thing to do if we want to cut off the supply thereby
ensuring that the demand for animal products is not un—

wittingly created for the luxury trades.

URGENT ACTION REQUEST
ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS CHARTER

An urgent letter of support is being requested by organizations
wishing to endorse the initiative for a Charter on Environmental

Rights and Obligations.

Individuals and organizations supporting the principles
enunciated in the Draft ECE Charter on Environmental Rights and
Obligations are requested to fax a message of support to a
meeting in The Netherlands organized to save this important
initiative.

The Draft ECE Charter on Environmental Rights and Obligations was
adopted at an Experts Meeting in Oslo, Norway. 29-31 October
1990. The Draft Charter proclaims important fundamental
principles and rights relative to, a.o.. access to information,
education, participation in decision-making, legal protection and
compensation, including legal standing for individuals, NGO's,
minorities to legal recourse on transboundary environmental
impacts.

Several nations apparently would like to weaken the Draft Charter
initiative and substantially reduce scope and breadth of the
principles. In order to revitalize this initiative The
Netherlands is hosting an ”Ad Hoc Meeting on Environmental Rights
and Obligations of the Economic Commission of Europe” from June
29 to July 6, 1991 in The Hague. The ECE is a economic region of
the United Nations encompassing the USSR,. Eastern and Western
Europe and North America.

It is imperative that principles embodying environmental rights
be extended to the international community through the ”Earth
Charter”, Agenda 21, and any other conventions or statements of
principles that are adopted at UNCED. This is absolutely an area
in which major advances can be achieved in Brazil!

Please mail or fax a message of support to the ”Ad Hoc Meeting on
Environmental Rights and Obligations of the ECE” opposing any
weakening of the principles and rights called for in the Draft
ECE Charter on Environmental Rights and Obligations. Make a
positive declaration of your organization’s position.

The fax number at The Netherlands Environment Ministry is:
31 70 3174722. The telephone number is 31 70 317 4174.

Or for more information fax or contact. William Pace, Center for
Development of International Law, e—mail is IGC:CDIL,

‘ onsortium for Action to Protect the Earth

Working together for US. leadership at the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development. Brazil. 1992

 

6/ 10/91

WORKING PAPER 0N ,
REFORM or GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL INSTITUTIONS

Today's global environmental and development challenges require a bold, powerful yet ﬂexible
institution or set of institutions, offering much more than United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) can offer within its present structure and funding level. UNEP should
have powers similar to other U.N. organizations and have a greater role in overseeing
environment and development matters within the U.N. system. One of the principal goals of
the 1972 Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment was to infuse the U.N. system
with an environmental censcience. Today, every U.N. institution must make a commitment to
improving its environmental performance. “

Over the last twenty years, it has become clear that governments alone cannot solve the global
environmental crisis, and that peeple who are most affected have a right to be involved and
must be empowered to take action. Many world leaders, such as those involved in the 1990
Bergen Ministerial Declaration and the Brundtland Commission. have called for strengthened
U.N. institutions that actively involve the public in implementing programs and international
obligations. The 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development
(UNCED) in Brazil provides a unique opportunity to strengthen the capability of the
international community and the world’s people to work together to meet human needs while
preserving the earth. -

Recommendations

A. A U.N. environmental organization should have the po_w_er to set international
environmental standards: Just as international health and labor standards are set by

appropriate UN. organizations, international environmental standards should be set by °
a UN. environmental organization. This organization should have its own constitution
enabling it to establish such standards by majority vote decision-making procedures

and to act more rapidly and effectively to address environmental problems. A model
for such a constitution is provided by the International Labor Organization (11.0)
which has such powers to set standards and to ensure compliance with those
standards. The ILO’s governing structure -- giving equal weight to governments and
NGOs - has proven effective in implementing its standards and norms. Such an .-‘
organization should incorporate and continue the Working Party approach used in the
UNCED preparatory process as a means of gathering policy advice from a broad
range of experts. The organization should be given status equal to other .major U.N.
organizations, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and ILO, and it
should, through a revived Environment Coordination Board or other high level UN.
system oversight mechanism, review the programs and policies of other U.N. .
institutions, especially those involved with environment and. development. Additionally,
the upcoming choice for the new UN. Secretary-General must reflect leadership on
environmental issues and the inspiration needed to implement the institutional

recommendations that are emerging from UNCED. .

B. An environmental compliance council should monitor and assist nations’

compliance with their obligations under international environmental augments:
There has been little attention paid to compliance by nations with the dozens of

existing environmental agreements. An environmental! compliance council, comprised
of independent experts, should be established to review the implementation of national
treaty obligations. The council could either become part of an enhanced U.N.
environment organization or be integrated into existing and new international
environmental agreements as part of their compliance mechanisms. It would use
reporting and publicity to encourage compliance, a method that, when applied, has
proven more effecrive ' in bringing about compliance than the formal adjudicatory
procedures found in many treaties.

The council also should play a leading coordinating role in any special programs of

\ ﬁnancial and technical assistance established under international environmental
agreements. A positive determination by the council that a nation is making good-

’ faith efforts to comply with agreement obligations would be a condition of eligibility
for assistance under such programs. For example, similar powers have been given to
4 the Executive Committee of the Interim Multilateral Fund to determine the eligibility
of developing countries for funding and technology transfer under the Montreal ‘
Protocol. '

There is considerable precedent for compliance mechanisms in international
organizations, such as the ILO, the International Whaling Commission, and the

International Atomic Energy Agency, and under treaties, such as the human rights
conventions, the 1957 BBC treaty, and environmental agreements involving biodiversity
(CITES), pollution from ships (MARPOL), dumping of wastes into the sea (London
Dumping Convention), and, mOSt recently, ozone protection (Montreal Protocol).

C. An auditing body should conduct environmental audits of all EN. institutions’
W Virtually all U.N. institutions, including GATT and the World Bank, have

major impacts on the environment throughout the, world. Yet no one body within the
UN. system has responsibility to evaluate the programs, procedures, and agreements
administered by U.N. institutions, and to encourage the adoption of the most
environmentally sound practices. Audits should be performed by independent experts
and be made available to the public. Maurice Strong, the UNCED Secretary-General,
has urged the creation of a UN. auditing body. '

D. Minimum Environmental‘lmggct Assessment Enigments for all U.N. ~ .
institutions should be established: The lack of standard BIA procedures results in

haphazard environmental review of speciﬁc projects or programs. Asa result, IJN.
institutions and the public are deprived of an important tool for gauging compliance
with environmental policies. UNCED should agree to principles, perhaps in the form
of a convention, for EIAs that provide for meaningful public participation and
conform to UNEP guidelines. The principles should form the minimum requirements
for U.N. institutions conducting assessments, and should include consideration of global

 




impacts, such as climate change and biodiversity, social impacts, such as those on
indigenous peoples, and alternatives to proposed actions. U.N. institutions conducting
assessments should review the cumulative environmental effect of their projects.

EResourcetrase ouldbeoverseeba ..e 'n tao n :
Poorer countries will need increased ﬁnancial and technological resources to comply
with new international environmental obligations. The Montreal Protocol establishes a
worthy precedent in which wealthy parties agree to make additional funds and access
to new technologies available to poorer parties acceding to the Protocol. New
agreements should create similar mechanisms for "resource transfers" based on a
broad range of strategies including debt reduction, levies on environmentally damaging
activities, or other means. An enhanced U.N. environmental organization should be
responsible for coordinating and overseeing these arrangements, which may involve,
other UN. agencies, the multilateral development banks, bilateral aid agencies, and
other institutions. - ~ -

All "resource transfer" mechanisms must be fully transparent, allow participation _ by
affected populations, and draw on a wide range of technical expertise. The
environmental audit process recommended above should ensure that all development
assistance programs are consistent with the goals of international environmental
agreements, particularly in key sectors such as energy, forests, and agriculture.

F. Publ c rtici tio sh uld be a teed lanni a d 'sio - akin
activities within the U.N. g1 stern: At the present time, members of the public at best
have had uneven access to international institutions. Yet these . institutions are
increasingly making decisions that affect their health and environment. Not only are
pe0ple critical in implementing environmental goals, they have the right to participate
in those decisions. An excellent example of public participation in decision-making is
found under the [LO system of governance. The 1987 Brundtland Commission, 1990
Bergen Conference, and US. government recognize the public’s right to participate in
international decision-making. To encourage public participation, the UN. system
should take the following steps: First, establish an "Ombudsperson" within each U.N.
institution to be a liaison between the public and the institution. It would also hear
complaints of the public, make determinations on complaints, and have the power to
issue orders. Second, adopt an international "Freedom of Information Act" - a
process for access to information with recourse to court to compel disclosure -
applicable to all UN. institutions and to documents submitted to U:N. ' institutions.

G. QECED should support the gating 2‘ gm!“ 2M"!!! arguing to enable
individuals to protect :35!!!ng and their gnvimmegt gym abuse: All governments
must recognize that the public has the right to know about, to participate in, and to.
appeal decisions that may adversely affect their right to a safe and healthy
environment. The US. experience with open government and citizen environmental
rights have demonstrated that the public can play a central role in improving
environmental protection. Lack of such rights has resulted in environmental

catastrophe in areas such as Eastern Europe, where extensive damage is only nOw .
being revealed. It is imperative that principles embodying environmental rights be
extended to the international community through the "Earth Charter", Agenda 21, and
'any other conventions or statements of principles that are adopted at UNCED. For
example, citizens should have: '

0 access to government meetings (”government in the sunshine" laws);

0 access to information about hazardous substances and their release into
the environment (”community right-to-know” law); -

e the power to enforce environmental laws in court and have rights of
discovery or other tools that enable citizens to serve an effective
"watchdog" role (citizen suit, provisions);

0 the right to notice of ‘any government action with signiﬁcant
environmental effects and opportunity to comment and receive a
response (administrative procedures law);

0 access to courts through liberal standing tests and to invoke judicial
review of government actions, to ask for injunctions, and have the
opportunity. to appeal to the highest court (administrative procedures
law); ‘

e the right to participate in the consideration of environmental factors in
programs, policies, and projects (environmental impact assessment laws);

0 the right to democratic governance accountable to the public for
decisions affecting the envirOnment. ~

Additionally, individuals and NGOs should be granted the right to petition the
environmental compliance council described above in regard to suspected state non-
compliance with international environmental obligations.

SEATTLE (AP) -- Nordstrom says ,.

it’s closing its remaining in-store fur
salons to put the floor space to better

use, but animal rights activists.

nouncernent as a victory.

by overproduction, a weak economy
and warm weather on the West

“The decision to close the fur

RACETRACK PROPOSED

A

 

Cranberry Township officials are
considering a plan to build a
thoroughbred racetrack on 155 acres on
Route 228 in Cranberry Twp (Allegheny
County).

Many residents are objecting to the
proposed track because traffic conges-
tion is already an enormous problem in
this area. The track would hold 5,000
spectators and park 3,000 cars.

According to Animals’ Agenda Nov.
1990:

Nearly 300,000 horses were slaugh-
tered in this country for human con-
sumption abroad during fiscal 1988, 212
more than in the previous year. "A
large portion of those were horses off
the track," claims Robin 0. Lohnes,
executive director of the American
Herse Protection Association.

In 1989 more than half of the 91,436
thoroughbreds who raced in Nbrth
America earned fewer than $3,000, which

The Moscow Circus is
returning with different
routines but the same sad
living conditions for its
captive wild animals.

Like other circuses,
the wild animals of the
Moscow Circus spend most
of their lives imprisoned
in small traveling_cages
and trucked from town to
town.

In contrast to our
nation’s growing respect
for wild animals in their
natural state, to our zoos
moving toward natural

acts are a cruel anachro—

spectacles cling to per-
verted images of bears in
tutus, chimps on bicycles,
and lions jumping through

crack of the trainer’s
whip.

Bear cubs are often
captured in the wild and
their defending mothers
are killed.

 

Fear and punishment are
used to obtain the intri—
cate routines performed by
these wild animals. ,

And, when they get too
old, these tired perform-
ers are sold, often to be—
come targets on big game
ranches or spectacles in

SLAUGHTER OE REFUGE BISON

Montana officials, on January 2,
approved the continued slaughter of bi-
son that wander outside Yellowstone
National Park boundaries. This year’s
plan includes federal park rangers in
the killing. This herd represents the
last free-ranging bison herd in the
HU.S.

More than 700 refuge bison have been
slaughtered in the past five winters.
Already this year another 11 have been
killed. State game wardens serve as
guides for the hunters, and will likely
be responsible for killing the female
bison. ,

While cattlemen claim bison spread
brucellosis to cattle, no case of
transmission has ever been documented.
Even Park Service officials say it is
unlikely the disease is transmitted.
Furthermore, no cattle graze West
Yellowstone in the winter, when the
bison are slaughtered!

 

Help stop the slaughter! VQQIT or

DISSECTION MAY BE CUT  
FROM PITTSBURCH’S HIGH SCHOOLS

 

 

On January 30, the
biology teachers of
’Pittsburgh’s Public
Schools will decide on
whether to eliminate or
curtail high school
dissection.

Pittsburgh’s el-
ementary and middle
schools eliminated
dissection three years
ago.

The reasons are both
educational and ethical
for Doris Litman, the
district’s Director of
Science Education, "If
we’re trying to teach
respect for the
environment, we have to
look at these things as
part of the environ—

 

ment." (Pittsburgh Press
12-2-90)

There are many
compelling reasons to
eliminate dissection:

- Preservation of animal
carcasses often results
in bleached, shriveled
organs.

— Formaldehyde, a common
preservative, is a known
carcinogen. Dissection
exposes young children
directly to this cancer-
causing chemical.

- Frog populations in
many countries have been
decimated from the de—
mand for dissection
specimens and "gourmet”
frogs’ legs.

- The collection and
killing of animals for

dissection is largely
unregulated.

- Dissection is a very
upsetting experience for
many young children.

— Dissection desensi-
tizes children rather
than encouraging an ap—

1~preciation for life.

— Dissection labs are
vastly inferior to to-
day’s advanced educa-
tional materials and
models.

 

 

 

If you are a parent,
teacher, or student, and
would like to encourage
the elimination of
dissection in your
school district, please
call us at 321—9606 for
more information.

NAHUNAI... AUI‘)UBON SOCIETY
Awlw‘lmACKS ANIMAI... RIGHTS

The National Audubon Society
launched a vicious attack on the animal

rights community with a lengthy article.

in its Nov.—Dec. Audubon Magazine.

While challenging the credibility of
.our movement, Audubon applauds, of all
things, fur trapping!

The article, ”Fuzzy-Wuzzy Thinking
About Animal Rights" could easily have
appeared in a fur trade magazine.

‘ A few notes from this outrageous
article:

Audubon describes trappers as
environmentalists who ”love the animals
they kill."

Audubon’s author describes nature as
‘nothing better than “a slaughterhouse.”
To defend the status quo, Audubon

proclaims "we have laws to protect
animals from needless human cruelty and
overharvesting."

Fact: a UHS. Interior Department
internal review recently recommended
another 600 to 3,000 plants and animals
be added to our nation’s federal
endangered species list, presently num-
bering 550.

Audubon claims trappers are "more
likely to help save an endangered
species than to wipe it out."

Fact: traps are indiscriminate
killers. For every target animal, 2—3
others are trapped. The fur trade is

 

SPRING H ING l‘x’Al‘llwlfi

responsible for the decimation of
nearly every species it has chosen to
exploit. Trafficking in endangered
pelts continues today.

Audubon claims mink, muskrats and_
beaver drown "within a minute or so of
entering“ a water trap. Fact: muskrats
and mink struggle for up to 4 minutes,
while beavers fight for their lives for
up to 24 minutes.

Audubon claims chewed—off legs are a
rarity. Fact: trap lines often go
unchecked for days, and one in four an—
imals chews a limb off to escape.

Audubon actively promotes the anti-
ecological activities of fur trapping
and sport hunting.

Object to this blatant disregard fer
the truth:

Robson Bight is a small bay on the northeast coast of Vancouver Island. It lies within a larger body of
water known as Johnstone Strait. which separates Vancouver Island from the rest of British Columbia and
Canada. Every summer up to 190 killer whales enter the Strait to feed on migratory salmon. Almost all
will frequent Robson Bight to socialize. rest and in a unique behavior not yet fully understood, rub
themselves on the pebbles of several small underwater beaches. Many consider this area the best location in
the world to View and research killer whales in the wild.

Unfortunately the future of the whales at Robson Bight is being jeopardized by the actions of logging
company MacMillan Bloedel. Robson Bight is bordered on land by the Tsitika Valley, a pristine old-
growth forest and watershed area. in 1979 the Government of British Columbia opened to logging much of
the upper Tsitiha watershed. away from Robson Bight. The logging continued unabated despite a report in
1982 by Parks Canada warning. ”Logging oi' the upper and lower Tsitika watershed may lead to
deterioration of core killer whale habitat and the surrounding area. " Machllan Bloedel's clear-cutting has
now destroyed large portions of the upper Tsitika wilderness that were once prime habitat for black-tailed
deer. Roosevelt ellt. black bears. cougars. martens and wolves. '

Last year. in the {ace of tremendous public opposition. MacMillan Bloedel began logging in areas of
the lower Tsitiha. just 2.5 miles behind Robson Bight. and in the Schmidt Creek drainage. directly east of
the rubbing beaches! They plan to continue logging in more areas of the lower Tsltilta and have begun
building an access road which points directly toward the Bight. .

To study the impacts of human activities on the whales. the federal and British Colombian
governments have formed I joint lohnstone Strait Killer Whale Committee. Not only is the Commuter:
examining the effects of logging but also the extensive use of Robson Bight and much of Johnstone Strait
by commercial fishing vessels. This fall the Committee will recommend what actions are necessary to
protect the whales.

Derek Ferguson. Division Manager at the logging company. claimed. "MacMillan Bloedel has been
logging in the Tsitiltn for 12 years with no impact on the whales. Studies have shown that no harvesting
activities have harmed water quality in Robson Bight."

To the contrary. studies assessing the impact of logging on siltation levels in the Tsitilta River, which
flows directly into the center of Robson Bight. began just last year. after MacMillan Bloedel had already
started logging in the lower Tsitika. The Johnstone Strait Killer Whale Committee in its draft ”background
report" stated. "The effects of logging adjacent to Robson Bight on killer whales and killer whale habitat are
as yet undetermined. " .

Potentially. the effects of logging so near to Robson Bight could force the whales to leave that area and
the surrounding parts of Jahnltone Strait. Clear cutting leaves large tracts of land devoid of forest. thus
greatly increasing the rate of soil erosion. Logging in areas oi the lower valley would substantially increase
the amount of mud. silt and debris already flowing into Robson Bight from the upper forest via the Tsitika
River. thus making the Bight virtually uninhabitable. The completion of logging roads is also a major
concern. These roads will significantly improve access to Robson Bight. Studies have shown that whales
will leave the area ii‘people are present on nearby shores.

Would the whales be capable of surviving if they could no longer return to this area? The Johnstone
Strait Committee writes. "...there are many unanswered questions regarding the biological requirements of
these whales, such as ‘How important are Johnstone Strait and Robson Bight in the ecology of this
population of killer whales? Until such basic questions can be answered. management of human activnies
with short-term and potential long-term impacts on the whales must be conservative."

ACTION: If you are concerned for the welfare of the killer whales inhabiting Robson Bight. write to the
Premier of Victoria. British Columbia. Aslt that no further logging occur in the entire Tsitika watershed.

Save the Whales
P.0. Box 3650

20007

Dear Ms. Stevens;

I am writting you to bring to your attention the threat to
the killer whales that the logging of the Tsitika Valley
poses. The government here has seemingly become immune to the
need for meaningful public input. It appears from the
experience in Washington and Oregon that it was necessary for
the relevant US federal body to step in to establish
appropriate controls. The state authorities were too easily
manipulated by the very powerful forest industry to be truly
able to preperly manage the woods for the good of the entire
community. ‘

The enclosed tables reflect how poorly our entire forest
industry is managed. Even if the forest is viewed as nothing
more than a harvestable fiber (an all too frequent view), it
should at least be sold to the highest not the lowest bidder.
The surcharge of 15% duty recently imposed by the States on
imported B.C. forest products was to offset the unfair market
advantage such products had in the States because they paid
an unfairly low stumpage rate here. This is but one indicator
of how sympathetic the relationship is between the forest
industry and the Ministry of Forests.

It seems therefore, that in order to prompt our federal
government to action, that external ressure must be brought
to beer. I have contacted your organization in the hOpes that
you might be able to help publicize this issue. As I have no
previous experience in organizations or causes I do.not have
specific suggestions as to how to create the necessary public
awareness.'

If you judge the plight of the whales at Robson Bight to be

_significant, I can certainly provide you with a wealth of
information. In exchange, I would certainly welcome your
suggestions as to how to best bring this issue out into the

open, before al on old growth forest disappears.
Yours si cerely,
David G 99‘*{

notes from conversation '* Susan Hovenstot July 18, 1991
Friends of the Tsitilta
6044389242

-~Logg° in the Tsitika Valley has been a controversial issue since early 1970s. At that
time the sitilta was the last unlogged watershed on the east coast of Vancouver Island.
Circa 1973 a 5 year moratorium placed on logging in Tsitika. .

--Circa 1978 a new local government took office and set up a task force to study the
situation. Basically a pro-logging task force. They develoPed a plan to log the Um
Tsitika Valley. Environmentally speaking it wasn't a ”bad" plan compared to some of the
other logging on Vancouver Island.

-—Since that time logging has occurred in various cut blocks of the upper 90% of the
Tsitika. Most environmental groups now took the position of ' protection for the
Lostitilta. Bottom 10% known as Lower Tsitika. The entire Tsitilta watershed makes
up about 44,000 hectors (2 acres = 1 hector).

--Lower Tsitilta is adjacent to Robson Bight, an area seasonally inhabited by about 185
killer whales. (These 185 are part of a population of 300 that exists on the west coast of
British Columbia) Orcas commonly swim up the sharply inclined slopes of Robson
Bight’s pebble beaches to rub themselves. A behavior not yet understood.

“Circa 1982 the Robson Bight was declared an ”ecological reserve". By 1989 the logging
company. MacMillan Bloedel. had agreed that an area of 650 feet wide by 1.5 miles long.
adjacent to the ecological reserve, would be set aside never to be logged. The danger to the
whales from logging is mainly that soil erosion from the forest will run—off into Robson
Bight making it a muddy uninhabitable bay.

"In April 1990 it was time for the loggers to develop a new 5-year plan. The Minister of
Forests declared that no logging would occur in the lower Tsitilta until public meetings
were held in the fall of 1990. In October 1990 MacMillan Bloedel began logging in that
area. No such meetings had yet been convened.

wFriends of the Tsitika staged various human blockades for 5 weeks while logging
continued. About 30 people were arrested. During this tine MacB. felled about 30
hectors.

«Because of the controversy, the federal and provincial governments together created the
Johnstone Strait Killer Whale Committee to inve ' ate the potential harmful effects on the
whales not only from logging but from tour and fi ‘ boat traffic as well. and make
recommendations. They had hearings in June and are due to make their recommendations
this fall.

--ACI‘ION ALERT: If you are concerned for the welfare of Robson Bight's killer whales
write to the Johnstone Strait Committee. Ask that no further logging occur in the Tsitika
and that no vessels be allowed to enter the Robson Bight Eco Reserve during the summer
months when the cross are present. Address:

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
BACKGROUND

Northern Johnstone Strait is known as one at the best areas in the worid to view and smdy
killer whales. In 1982. the province of British Columbia established a marine ecological
reserve in the Strait to protect special killer whale habitat. An upland portion was added to
this reserve in 1988-89. and the area is now known as Robson Bight (Michael Bigg)
Ecological Reserve (#111). ' .

Until 1970, killer whales shared the waters at Johnstone Strait mainly with merchant trailic
and commercial ilehlng vessels. Since then. the scale of human activities in the region has
grown dramatically and a highway completed In 1979 from Campbell River to Port Hardy now
makes the area easily accessible. As a result. much more marine activity is observed In
Johnstone Strait than in the pest. \ .

’ Recently. concerns have arisen that human activities such as whale watching. logging. and
commarcieiiishlng cumulatively threaten continued use of the area. particularly the rubbing
beeches. by killer whales. in response to these concerns. the 8.0. Minister of Parks (BC
Parks) and the Minister of Departmentoi' Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) jointly appointed the
Johnstone Strait Killer Whale Committee to provide a background report and to recommend
management options to ensure the continued presence of killer whales in Johnstone Strait.

The Committee’s background report defines issues and outlines preliminary recommendations

for public review and comment. This document describes:

. the importance of Johnstone Strait and Robson Bight (Michael Blgg) Ecological Reserve
(RBMBER) to killer whales:

. the patterns of human activities in these areas;

. the impacts that these activities may have on killer whales and their habitat; and,

- managementoptlons and preliminary recommendationsto deal with these issues.

This report is being distributed widely to the public and interest groups.inciuding Native

grOUpa. in preparation for public meetings scheduled for June 1991.

iMPORTANCE or= .rormsrone awn AND ROBSON BIGHT TO
KILLER WHALES . A ~

Today. Johnstone Strait is widely known as the best location in the world to view and
research killer whales in the wild. Up to 190 killer whales use Johnstone Strait each summer.
primarily to feed on migrating salmon. Daily predictability of whale sightings and occasional
concentrationsof 50-100 whales in these sheltered waters otter unequalled opportunitieefor
research and wildlife viewing of these complex and visually impressive animals.

Over 90% of the killer whales that enter Johnstone Strait each summer also frequent the
Robson Bight area to socialize. rest and mb on pebble beaches. Rubbing behaviours have
been rarely seen elsewhere and nowhere else have these behaviours been observed with
such frequency or involving such large numbers of whales. Recent studies have shown that
killer whales in Johnstone Strait spend as much as 20% of their time in RBMBER. with that
time (tinged almost equally between the Bight itself. the mbblng beaches. and the remainder
of the serve.

 




. . iv
OVERVIEW OF HUMAN ACTIVITIES

Resource use in and around Johnstone Strait primarily involves fores .commemlsl and sport
fishing. tourism and transportation. In 1989. northern Vancouver lslan accounted for 8% of
the provincial timber harvest and 13% of the annual salmon catch. The area received over
270.000 visitors in 1908. of which 3.000 watched killer whales in Johnstone Strait. ‘

POTENTIAL SOURCES OF DISTURBANCE ‘ TO KILLER WHALES

The northern resident population of killer whales is increasing at a rate of 3% per year. a
relatively rapid growth rate for species with a potential lifespan of 50-75 years. Currently.
this growth rate does not reflect long-term negative effects of human activity in Johnstone
Strait or elsewhere in their range. Disturbance of killer whales by commercial fishing and
shipping outside the reserve appears to be minimal. On the other hand. there are indications
that viewing. research and photographic activities focused on the whales may result in short-
tenn disturbanceof whales. As the level of these activities increases. whale disturbance will
also increase. especially in the absence of effective control.

Within RBMBER. a three-year study by BC Parks indicates that short-term disturbance takes
place if killer whales are approachedfrom land or water. Thus. it appears that killer whales
have reduced their use of habitat in an area specifically set aside for their protection.

Commercial fishing In RBMBER. accounted for the mejorl of vessel approaches at or near
the nibblng beaches and the majority of disturbance rea s by killer whales. Potential
disturbance by whale watching boaters. commercial charters. researchers and photographers
was low. partly due to education. management and the seasonal presence of ecological
reserve information officers.

Land access and forestry activities are of concern because of their proximity to sensitive killer
whale habitat Logging is taking place both in the Tsitlka watershed behind the Bight area.
and in the Schmidt Creek drainage. directly east of the rubbing beaches. The primary
concerns are the possibility of increased amounts of sediments in the water and improved i
access to the area on logging roads. The effects of logging adjacent to RBMBER on killer
whales and whale habitat are as yet undetermined. Access via logging roads is a major
concern though as It has been shown that whales leave the area when people are on shore.
With one exception only, people so far have been observed to gain access to the reserve
beaches from the water as access via logging roads is cun'ently difflwlt.

Threats to the integrity of killer whales’ environment are often hard to detect because whales
are at the top of the food chain and have a low reproductive rate. Despite research since
the early 1970's. there are many unanswered questions regarding the biological requirements
of these whales. such as "How important are Johnstone Strait and Robson Bight in the
ecology of his population of killer whales?" Until such basic questions can be answered.
managementof human activities with short-term and potential long-term impacts on the
whales must be conservative. '

in Alaska. Hawaii and Baja California. vessel traffic has discouraged other species of whales
from using breeding and feeding habitats. There.ls a concern last a similar phenomenon
occurs in Johnstone Strait. However.we can do much to mitigate negative impacts.

AIRLINES REJECTING BIRD SHIPMENTS

KLM announced an immediate ban on all transports of live,
wild—caught birds on the company's aircraft from July 15, 1991,
onwards. KLM had become the biggest transporter of wild-caught
birds after Lufthansa went out of the business of carrying such
birds in November of last year. Swissair, Air France, NOrthwest
Airlines, Federal Express and Challenge Air Cargo have all ended
their part in this destructive business. Garouda (the Indonesian
airline) and Aerolineas Argentinas are expected to step shortly.
In Senegal, the world's largest exporter of wild—caught birds, the
numbers sent out of the country have already been halved as a
result of the airlines' decisions.

In a statement explaining reasons for its decision, KLM said.
"Various factors such as methods of capture, the change to a
captive environment, transport to EN] airport often lasting for
~days, the change in feed and the transmission of diseases in close
captivity can all contribute to a deteriorated condition of the
birds making them unfit for the air journey which is in itself
relatively brief. .Another contributing factor is the lack, in many
countries, of official regulations and of inspection and
enforcement agencies covering these transports."

The company referred to the.April 18th symposium it initiated,
stating: "In spite of the useful exchange of valuable information
at the symposium, it did not prove possible to end with a solution
acceptable to all parties. This has led to KLM's decision to stOp

all transports in this field."

The dealers responsible for both export and import of wild-
caught birds for the pet trade are unwilling to relinquish the
excessive profits they make. Though few in number, they monopolize
the business.

NEW JERSEY: WILD BIRD BILL PASSES SENATE 38-0

The New Jersey Senate Committee on Labor, Industry and
Professions held hearings June 24 on S. 3515 and voted 4 to 0 to
send it to the Senate floor for final action. The bill,
introduced by Senate President John Lynch, is a companion to
Assemblyman Bennett Mazur’s A. 649, passed by the Assembly 66 to

2. The Senate passed it 38 to 0 on July 15.

Events Leading Up to Passage

Mr. Mazur appeared before the Committee, strongly urging
passage of the bill. He asked that Charles Munn, world authority
on macaws and other parrot species, testify. Because of the
importance of the hearing, Dr. Munn had flown in from Peru where
he has been observing macaws for years, including the rare and
disappearing hyacinth macaw, a prime victim of the pet industry.
He urged the necessity for the legislation in order to make it
possible for the bird populations to recover.

Janet Lilienthal, representing the American Federation of
Aviculture, testified at length, making unsubstantiated
allegations about the content of the legislation. She tried to

tell the Senators that bird magazines advertising exotic birds

would be "outlawed" by the Mazur-Lynch bill, but this patent

absurdity was corrected by Chairman Raymond Lesniak.
Mrs. Lilienthal insisted that only the World Wildlife

Fund/industry-supported bill pending in the U. S. Congress should

 




be passed. This bill provides a five-year-long phaseout of
imports for the pet trade. Under questioning, she was forced to
admit that it would pre—empt any state legislation.

An attempt to kill the bill by adding a minor amendment
(thus requiring the bill to go back through the Assembly in the

final days of the session) was voted down 3 to 2. Chairman

Lesniak then called for the vote on the bill itself, and it

passed without opposition.
A. 649/8. 3515 was sent to the full Senate where it passed
unanimously. It has now been sent for signature to Governor

James Florio.

Another of Alaska's magnificent animals is being threatened by man's
greed, In an area where they should be free from any exploitation. the
lynx population of Alaska's Kenai (Kee ni) National Wildlife Reserve has
been decimated by trappers. What‘s even worse is the US Fish and

refused to take any action until the last possible minute.

In 1985. despite a recommendation from their own biologists
that the lynx population of the Kenai Refuge was being "over-exploited"
by “an intense persistent and prolonged harvest...". the FWS remsed to
close the area to lynx trapping. A portion of the refuge was closed
later in the season but all this did was to cause the trappers to
intensify their efforts in other parts of the refuge.

According to the Alaskan Wilsiife Alliance. the following year
F'WS biologists specifically recommended the 1986-‘87 trapping
season not be opened because. "'lynx are being removed almost twice
as fast as they are being added to the population.” The staff of the
Kenai Refuge also submitted a report concluding. "'if more time passes
before taking any effective action... on the refuge. the lynx population
will probably-.be seriously impacted”.

, Still the FWS refused to close any more of the refuge until 28
days into the 1988-‘87 season. During those 28 days 23 lynx were
killed.

The entire Kenai Peninsula was closed to trapping before the
next season and it is still closed at the present. It remains to be seen
if the lynx population will rebound or forever vanish from the Kenai
National Wildlife Reserve and the peninsula. These hardy cats have
the FWS to thank for stacking the odds against them.

There are profits in primates. But there is nothing but
misery for the primates caught in trade.

There are several levels of primate trade.

All over Amazonia, primates are sold on meat markets. The
preferred animals for meat are the larger monkeys, the woollies,
spiders, and bowlers. One of the means of spread of the current
cholera epidemic across South America is the sale of contaminated
monkeywmeat on filthy markets and roadside stalls.

Monkeys are also sold on the meat markets of Africa and, to
a lesser extent, in Asia.

There is also a limited pet trade in the countries where
primates live. - Exotic pets have long been popular in expatriate
and missionary circles.

Internationally, there is heavy trading in primates removed
from the wild.

There is a high~volume trade in monkeys For biomedical
research. In 1989, [NUMBER TO BE SUPPLIED MONDAY] monkeys were
imported to the United States. Indonesian animal dealer Charles
Darsono has estimated that 2-3 monkeys die for' each monkey

successfully eXported.

 




 

 

 

 

 

Monkeys are caught in forest areas usually far from big
cities. Sometimes they are caught by trapping and sometimes by
‘ the killing of mothers carrying babies. The rural holding
compounds are simply ghastly. The animals, some unweaned babies,
are kept in improper cages and are fed inappropriate foods. No
veterinary care is available. Stressed and often traumatized,
freshiy-caught primates die like flies, with the survivors being
shipped to big city exporters’ ’oompounds, which are often
disgusting.

Efforts to improve overseas holding compounds for primates
have recently been spurred by two disastrous disease outbreaks in
the United States.

In 1989, an epidemic of a disease identified as simian
hemorrhagic fever (SHF) broke out at a New Mexico research
laboratory. The epidemic brought miserable deaths to over 400
monkeys. A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) investigating team
traced the route of the monkeys from an exporter’s compound in
the Philippines to the premises of a Miami animal dealer, on

whose premises they stayed for one day, before being shipped to
New Mexico.

CDC inspectors reported that:

Three hundred and eighty
received by

cynomolgus monkeys were
Importer A from February 6 through March

27. Twenty—four monkeys (6%) were dead on arrival and

120 were shipped to other Facilities within 2 days of

arrival. 0f the 236 remaining cynomolgus monkeys, 182

(77%) died at the Importer A facility within 5 weeks

of their arrival. . no local, state or federal

authorities were notified.

The 000’s remarkable report, whidh has received no
attention in the scientific or lay press, casts a penetrating
glance into the suffering and high mortality associated with even
the legal primate trade. Free copies of the CDC’s full report
are available from IPPL, P08 766, Summerville, SC 29484.

In 1990, another disease outbreak occurred in primates,
this time in monkeys imported by a Virginia firm. Several
hundred monkeys died Or were killed when found infected with a
disease similar to Ebola fever which causes over 80% mortality in
infected humane. Several humans gin different locations were
found to have been infected by the virus. Although no humans
have become sick or died, CDC took another close look at the
monkey trade 'and inspected the facilities of registered
importers.

CDC closed down‘ many of these facilities after finding
sometimes appalling Conditions. At one dealer’s warehouse in
Miami, they reported that:

In some saying, the monkeys in the top tier were
observed to defecate, urinate and drop other wastes

through to the cage immediately below.

Monkeys are clean animals, always grooming each other in the

: wild. To be exposed to excrement would cause them misery as well

as risk spread of disease. Department of Agriculture inspectors

1 had found serious problems at some primate importers’ facilities
I for years, including at the Miami facility, where they once found
, dead monkeys in a refrigerator also containing animal food.
: However, the Department.of Agriculture has long had a policy of

"leading animal dealers into compliance." This policy has been

if an abysmal failure.

The proof that closing down a facility is the best or only

'7 way to “1ead” animai faoiiities "into compliance" is evidenced by
‘} what happened after CDC actuaiiy had the nerve to defy the
? primate dealers and their lobbyists and sides most of them down
‘ after finding serious problems of hygiene and sanitation. Most

‘ of the deaiers fixed up their premises rapidiy and were re-
. iicensad.

Recentiy, Charies River Research Primates, the 1argest US
iimporter, announced that it has hired a veterinarian, part of
: fwhose work is to visit the hoiding compounds overseas and improve
;,,Conditions. Whether she can succeed remains to be seen.

The sufferings of primates in iegai trade are matched and
perhaps exceeded by those caught of animais caught in iiiegai
' trade.

l Over 110 countries are now members of the Convention on
1 Internationai Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). A11 the great
: ape and 1emur Species are banned from commerciai trade by being
i listed on CITES Appendix I. Unfortunateiy, iisting of a species

A11 over the world there is great pubiic concern over the

for this:

a11ows captive-born animais to move in trade, which is an
invitation to fraud.

* Penaities are ridicuiousiy sma11 in most countries and
constitute an encouragement rather than a deterrent to wiidiife
crime.

Washington, DC 20007

Enclosed is a paragraph (attached ) describing a new dolphin and whale project in
Monterey Bay, California that individuals can participate in. I hope you can include this,
along with the enclosed photo of a Pacific white-sided dolphin (photo by Nancy Black),in
your Wildlife section.

Oceanic Society Expeditions is a nonprofit organization dedicated to conservation and
education about the marine environment. We are offering a new dolphin and whale
research (non-invasive) and education project in Monterey Bay, California. The project
will focus on the behavior, ecology, distribution and communication of Pacific white—
sided dolphins. I started this study four years ago through Moss Landing Marine
Laboratories and, because of its importance, Oceanic Society Expeditions hopes it will
become a long-term project. We also will be photo-identifying individual blue whales
and humpback whales, as well as collecting information on several other species of
whales and dolphins that are frequently seen during the fall. This is a unique opportunity
for individuals to learn about and observe many different species of marine mammals
(26 species have been observed) while contributing to a valuable research project.

The California coast is increasingly encroached upon by such activities as offshore oil
drilling and vessel traffic, which could impact these dolphins. Presently, Pacific white~
sided dolphins are being incidentally killed by the thousands in the Asian high seas drift
net fisheries in the North Pacific. It is of crucial importance to collect baseline
information on this species to determine the effects of human activities and to properly
manage and protect their habitat for the future. Blue and humpback whales are both
endangered species and therefore it is necessary to document the population and behavior
of these whales.

Thankyou for your time. If you have any questions, I can be reached at 408-663—
2838.

Sincerely, ,

Nancy Black

Study Dolphins and Whales

Oceanic Society Expeditions is offering the chance for individuals to
participate in an on-going dolphin and whale research project in
Monterey Bay, California. The project's focus is on the behavior,
ecology, communication and distribution of Pacific white-sided
dolphins. These dolphins are often found in groups of over 500
individuals and are one of the most acrobatic dolphins, often
engaging in multiple mid-air leaps, flips and somersaults. The
project also involves photo-identifying individual blue and humpback
whales, both endangered species, as well as collecting information
on other species of whales, dolphins and porpoises encountered.
Seven—day trips will be conducted during October and November,
1991. People are needed to help with all aspects of the research and
no prior experience is needed. Oceanic Society Expeditions is a non-
profit organization dedicated to conservation and education about
the marine environment. Participants in this project will have the
opportunity to learn about and observe dolphins, whales, seals, sea
lions, sea otters and sea birds while contributing to valuable
research. Fee required. Contact OCEANlC SOCIETY EXPEDITIONS, Fort

Alliance Interviews Dr. Vic Van Ballenberghe

 

 

Following is Part I of an interview
conducted by the Alliance with Dr. Vic
Van Ballenberghe. Dr. Van
Ballenberghe is a wildlife biologist for
the US. Forest Service in Alaska. He
previously worked with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game and is a
former member of the Alaska Board of
Game. His extensive research in
Alaska has concentrated on wolves and
their prey. He has opposed aerial
trapping and land-and-shoot hunting of
wolves. The views expressed in the
interview are his own and do not
necessarily reﬂect the position of The
Alaska Wildlife Alliance.

AWA - Could you give us a summary
of your professional background,
including where ‘ and when you’ve
studied wolves and/or their prey?

VVB - I started out in Minnesota in
1967, and as a graduate student at the
University of Minnesota did a master’s
project working on moose. A C “11916
years later I started on a Ph. D program
and studied wolves in northeastern
Minnesota, and got involved in not only
the basic biology of wolves but also
their management and the politics of it.
The situation was evolving from wolves
being totally unprotected to totally
protected. So I got a good dose of the
politics of wolf management.

I came to Alaska in 1974 and started
doing some mooSe and wolf research in
Glennallen, working for the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game. I spent
ten years in Fairbanks, a portion of that
with ADF&G as statewide furbearer

 

 

 

biologist. I then started working for the
Forest Service and have been there ever
since. And over time, my whole career

8 has been spent with moose and wolves

basically, both research and
management. I also had one three-year

term on the Alaska Board of Game

from 1985 to 1988.

AWA 4 Do you have any thoughts on

the accuracy and/or meanihg of '
ADF&G’s statewide wolf populations of .

anywhere from 5,000 to 7,000 wolves?

WB - It’s probably 1n the ballpark. I '

don’t think there’s 15,000 wolves 1n the
state, and I don’t think there’s 1,.000
The way it’s derived, really, is to ask the
management people what their opinions
are in most places. In some places
there’s data available and they actually

try to do some surveys and determine ’

the population. It’s: kind of a ﬁeld
person’s estimate of what they think 15
there, and it’s crude.1 guess, really, if
you think about it, it’s probably the best
thing that can be done, short of
spending a large amount of money,
ﬂying a lot of surveys to try to nail it
down with some precision. It' s crude

but it’s probably 1n the ballpark.

 

AWA - As a lay person, I am generally
suspicious of ADF&G’s estimates of
wolf numbers. I’d like to hear your
opinion of the method used to
extrapolate an actual account from a
smaller area over a larger area. Do

Photo by Daryl Pederson

' you think that extrapolation 15 applied

scientiﬁcally?

VVB - It’s tricky to do that. I
remember in Unit 13, we had data on a

' number of packs that occupied a
. portion of the unit. We had good data,

we actually had radio collars on the
packs and“ yOu could count the pack,
and you knew the territories, and so for

less than ‘a third of the unit you had . i

really gQOd data. And the tendency 1s

. to extrapolate to the whole unit. You

get into problems if you do that
because you’ve studied the best part
where the habitat is good. You start
extrapolating out and you get into less
good habitat, and it’s tricky.

AWA -' Do you think they-make an
honest attempt?

VVB - Yes, I do. I think they try to
give the best estimate for the amount of
information they have. I think it’s
ballpark. I don’t think it’s grossly under

or grossly over. And the range is pretty ,

wide, somewhere around 5,200 to 7,000.
And that’s a Fall estimate, so over
winter there’s probably 20 perCent
fewer by the end of winter. Everybody

. wants to know that number, just like

they Want to know how many moose

there are in Denali, and how many

bears there are here and there. So
there’s pressure on them to come up
with a number, and sure enough, they

come up. with a range. It’s the best that .

can be dune under the circumstances, I
suppose.

AWA - The estimate they use is the

typically the peak of the wolf population
or somewhat below the peak of the
population?

VVB - When the pups are born in
May would be the peak numbers. Then '
there’s attrition over the summer as
some of those animals die. From a
practical standpoint, going into Winter
would be considered the peak.

'AWA - In general, how would you

characterize the moose and/or caribou
populations in the state?

VVB - Caribou populations are high
and increasing. Virtually every major
herd ha' “creased in the last ten years,
and de .ies now are, on a relative
scale, high. The Western Arctic herd 15
at as high a density as 1t’s been since
probably the mid to late 70’s, and
absolute numberswise, it is high, about
360,000 animals. The Nelchina herd is -
so high that they’re trying to stabilize it
by increasing the harvest. The game
board acted to double the harVest
between 1989 and 1990, and plans in
1991 to go even higher. All the major
herds, the Mulchatna herd, the
Porcupine herd, have “increased and are
now at high numbers.

Mo‘ose have increased in some areas in
the last ten years, and remained stable
in others. In southcentral, the moose

. increased signiﬁcantly, until last winter. '

In other areas of » the Interior, moose
are still f at low levels. The harvest
ﬁgures have gone up.. We harvest
almost 8,000 moose annually statewide,
that’s up from 6,000 just a few years
ago. I lose track of what the caribou
harvest rs these days but it’s pretty high.

' In some areas of the state the season is

liberal. And we’ve done it- all without
any wolf control since 1983 and with the
restriction of land-and-shoot hunting
since 1987.

AWA - Caribou populations are high

and increasing. Is that management,

natural cycles, sheer luck, timing, all of

the above? -

WB- The perspective that I haveis

that ’caribou‘ ‘ pOpulatiOns- kind 3of
bottomed oUt in 1970-1976 period after

seine pretty big crashes. The Nelchina
herd crashed starting in the mid-’60s
The Western Arctic herd crashed and
bottomed out in the mid-’70s. So the
measures that were taken‘in some cases
to- stem those crashes were pretty
severe as far as hunting goes. Harvest
of the Nelchina herd went from 9,000 in
1971 to 900 the next year. That put the
brakes on that harvest, and the
restrictions ’were "retained. The
Western—- Arctic herd» was" the same

thing. They really'clampeddOWn on.

the’harvest. " And ' the herds responded
to that. And also, the old classic story
that game managers talk about, the
winter weather played a role — we had
relatively mild winters the whole decade
of the ’805 really. '

Moose, populations, somewhat the
same. Crashes and declines in the late
’60s and early ’705, and restrictions on
harvest. And also, relatively low wolf
numbers. To be fair about it, the. wolf

contrOl that was done in the Tanana

Flats, no one argues that it had an
impact? on moose numbers.

AWA - With caribou populations
increasing, and moose up and down in
different areas, how would you
characterize the state’s wolf
populations? Given the numbers, is it
"good", -is it increasing, decreasing?

VVB - I don’t know. It think the
ofﬁcial word is that it’s increasing
slightly, or slowly. And the census
ﬁgures, the ofﬁcial numbers suggest
that. They’ve creptup in the last three
or four years. But personally, I don’t
really know. I know that wolves are

 

relatively scarce in portions of
southcentral Alaska, and I know that
they’re scarce on the north slope and
the northwest coast. And I know that
in UnitV13, they res’p‘Ond‘ed to a two:

year ban‘on land-and-shoot hunting and '

the wolf numbers ‘there increased

somewhat. Statewide,» I don’t have a'

handle on it. I guess " it seems
reasonable to- me that upward creep
might have occurred in‘light of the fact

that moose and caribou are more,

plentiful now than they were ten years
ago. Generally, wolves respond to that,
unless hunting and trapping tends to
keep them down. It’s difﬁcult for
anybody ‘to have ' that statewide
perSpective. '

AWA - You mentioned some areasthat
seem to have few wolves. Are there
any areas that you would characterize
as having too many wolves?

VVB ., I don’t see the same kind of
problems

early ’80s. I don’t see any of those
problems really standing out. I don’t

see any places that'have a recpnt.

Jo-

decline of moose and caribou to the
point where wolves have gotten ahead
of them and are really doing a number
on them. I think there are still areas
where the ratio of wolves to prey is
relatively low and predation is intense.
But it’s been that way for a while. That
whole 20E country (the eastern interior
of Alaska) hasn’t gotten any worse; in
fact, if anything it’s probably gotten
better because the caribou herd has
come up some and wolf numbers have
not. They’ve remained low for the last
seven or eight years. But still you want
to think about some kind of predation
burden on moose there. In some areas,
like Unit 13, there’s really always been
too few wolves there to have much
impact on moose and caribou, ever
since 1950. The wolf population there
has always been kept at a relatively low
level. ' Same thing on the Kenai
Peninsula. So in these areas where the
prey population has come up, wolves
have either remained stable or come up
slightly but the predation situation has
actually improved.

now from" ~"a wolf/prey-
st‘andpoint that We had in the late ’708, ‘

AWA - The ADF&G Unit 20E study
stated that 32 percent of moose are
taken by predation and 2 percent are
taken by hunters. ADF&G biologists
have said that predator control Will be
needed if there is going to be human
' hunting. What are your views on that?

VVB - Mypperspective is that you can
continue to hunt in areas even like 20E,
if you regulate the hunting to where
you’re basically taking bulls only with a.
relatively short season, at least for
moose, and probably caribou as well.
What they’re Saying is they would hke
to shift that balance so that the hunters
take a higher portion of the yield, and .
that’s the angle they’re coming from.
The question is, how. many do wolves
take, what about the bears? What kind
of wolf control do we need to shift that
balance? But I think it’s clear that
hunting can continue without predator
control in mostsituations, but you have
to resign _ yourself to the fact that
sometimesthe yield to humans can be

L... pretty low, and that’s the situation they

have in 20E.

AWA - Staying on Unit 20, what effect
do you think thesubstantial wildﬁres of'
this past summe‘r'will haVe on meose? .

VVB — I think they’ll have a' positive
effect on moose populations there over
time. It’s hard to really say at this
point because ﬁre is not always
beneﬁcial to moose. Some fires are too
hot or occur at the wrong time of year
and what comes back is not favorable.
On the Kenai Peninsula, someof those
burns came back in grasses, and
sometimes you get spruce regeneration.
But in general, I would guess that
where last summer’s ﬁres burned, how
they burned, and the time of year they
burned, that there will be some positive
responses in the vegetation. And they
were large enough to impact a
signiﬁcant area. Time will tell, but my
guess at this point‘ is they would
improve the habitat for moose.

AWA - What is the focus of your
ongoing research in Denali National
Park? Are you in a position to give us
a summary of any ﬁndings you have as

Requires; _
Emergency
Closure in
Unit 13!

In November of 1989 the Alaska Board
of Game expanded the practice of land-
and-shoot, or '
hunting into four additional Game
Management Units: 11, 12, 13, and 20.
Unit 13, the Nelchina Basin in central
Alaska, was a particularly telling
example of the VBOard’s desire to
increase wolf hunting without even the
perceived necessity to limit predators.
But the open terrain in. Unit 13 makes
for "good" land-and-shoot hunting, and
the Board apparently felt no
opportunity to kill wolves should go
unexploited.

The moose pOpulation in Unit 13 is

increasing, and the caribou population
is at an all—time high. In spite of this
the Board opened the unit for land-and-
shoot hUnting. In. November, the
Anchorage Times printed an article
which stressed the, importance of
getting out land-and-shoot hunters in
Unit 13 to "protect the big game". This
is the same mentality promoted by an
Alaska Department of Fish and Game
(ADF&G) biologist several years ago
when, on ofﬁcial ADF&G letterhead,
he urged hunters to "do your part" to
protect moose and caribou by killing
wolves at every opportunity.

Then in January, 1991, two months
before the normal height of land-and-
shoot hunting, ADF&G declared an
emergency closure .of wolf. hunting in
Unit 13A because 35 wolves of an
estimated population of 90 had been
reported killed since August when the
season opened. And 25 of those 35
were killed by land-and-shoot hunters.
Normally, land-and-shoot hunting of
wolves reaches it, peak in March when
daylight 'is long and soft snow
conditions allow easy location and
tracking of wolves from the air.

Because Subunit 13A is closed to wolf
hunting for the remainder of the winter,
hunters and trappers, at least those that

abide by the regulations, will probably .-

focus, on the rest of Unit 13 and
surrounding areas, increasing the wolf
kills there. The ADF&G is "managing"
wolves to allow for a "harvest" of 135 in
the entire unit. In the rest of the unit,
33 wolves have already been reported
killed, and the season will remain open
through April, or until there are 135
wolves reported killed.

KenPitcher, southcentral management
coordinator for DWC, was quoted by
the Anchorage Times as saying, "You
don’t want one area to get really
creamed, and another area lightly
harvested, ‘You want to have your
harvests distributed more evenly among
subunits." It’s a good thing ADF&G is
making sure wolves "get creamed"
evenly in Unit 13. That way there is
only an unnecessary W of
wolves, inStead of complete
annihilation. Unless, of course, their
estimates are off, or someone is
misreporting the actual location of wolf
kills, or there is poaching in Unit 13, or
if natural mortality is up this year, or
any combination of these factors. .

Another quote by Mr. Pitcher in the
same article is indicative of ADF&G’S
use of land-and-shoot hunting as an

they might relate to wildlife
management or wildlife policy for both
predator and prey species in Denali,
and also elsewhere in the state? '

VVB - We’ve done a lot_ of things
there, everything from some behavioral
work on moose to trying to look at
nutrition and energetics and habitat
quality and that kind of thing. One
thing that I have had an interest in
from the ﬁrst year of the study, which
was 1980, was just monitoring the
moose pOpulation there in the eastern
portion of the park, from the Sanctuary
River eastward. It’s probably the only
naturally regulated population in the
state that has existed for some time.
And so I’m .
monitoring the status of that
population. Bears are abundant and
prey upon moose intensively. They
account for probably at least half of calf
mortality, and some adults. Wolves are
there and also prey upon moose. There
isn’t any ,hunting, except for some
animals that disperse. I’ve had some
collared moose that have left the park
and gotten shot. But by and large it’s a
small number of animals. Habitats are
not modiﬁed by people. So one of the
things that I’ve been most interested in
doing is just monitoring the status of
the moose population. There’s good
data going back, clear to the ’40s on
what the population has done.

What it did from the time that Olaus
Murie started watching it_until probably
1975,'wa'sf to ’i‘n’t'rbéa‘se,"s10w1y. In 1975 it
started a downward slide. And since
I’ve been there, 11 years, the population
has probably declined 5.0 percent -—
probably more, but at least 50 percent.
80 the question is why, and we don’t
fully know the answer to that. But we

 

 

interested in just

do know that bear predation is intense.
It’s been intense apparently since the
mid-’70s, and it was not intense prior to
that until something happened. PeOple
can only . guess at what that is. You
have to be . careful, because the
population has actually increased during
the same interval farther west in the
park. So obviously you have to be'very
speciﬁc about where you’re talking
about. I’m. talking about basically
between the park entrance and the
Sanctuary River. 'Even now, there’s a
fairly high density of moose in there. I
ﬂy an area every year or every other

, year and I actually see about two and a

half moose per square mile, Which is a
considerably high density. What I’d like
to do is monitor the population m%e
future to see where this decline bOttoms
out and try' to look at some of the
reasons why it does, and continue
tracking that as it bottoms out ,and
starts to increase again. But I think it’s
probably got a ways, to go befOre it does
that. . i '

So from a management standpoint, I’ve
always thought we need to monitor
these naturally regulated populations,
and they’re few and far between --'

there’s really only a few in North'

America -- totry to understand how

they function in relation to predation

and habitat and everything else. ‘That
will provide some perspective for the
managed populations.

AWA - I have heard, more so inbthe
late ’70s and early ’805, from other
biologists, that the moose population in
Denali is in serious shape, is declining,
and while they may not have been
advocating it, they were at least
suggesting that if there were not some
wolf control there, the moose

~ - . ,- _‘ "U. Wywrhw; .
.ng-QWw “

population could virtually disappear in
that part of the. park. ‘You haven’t
mentioned wolves at all as far as a
problem or ~a reason for the decline
there. Are wolves involved to ”any
extent in what you see in the decline, is
it primarily bears, is, it primarily a
decline in habitat or is there no way to
tell? . / ' ' A .
VVB, .- I think there’s clearly a way to
sort Out those things. Something
happened to the Savage River wolf pack
in ’83 or so, and there weren’t many
wolves in that end of the park between
’83 and ’89, and so the poor calf
survival is due almost entirely to bear

Jredation- Prior .to that I don’t think

they played much role either because ~

‘ the population was quite a bit higher

‘ even though the wolves were there in
pretty good numbers around ’75 when
the changes started. Moose are not
going to disappear there; moose are
going to persist. I’m sure that this
decline will extend a few years into the
future, but eventually things will bottom
out and the situation will change
around. But as I say, the density is still,
on a relative basis, pretty high. But it is
much less than it was 15 years ago.
When you drive the road in the fall,
moose are scarce. In the mid-’70s,
between the headquarters and Savage
River, you’d see 10-12 moose; now
you’re lucky to see one or two in an
evening. But I’m not concerned.
Moose'will persist.

AWA - From your studies in Denali, do
you have any comments on the status

and/or behavior of the park’s wolf .

population and also on the ongoing
National Park Service research
program? '

 

_, van-
- ,.W_ 1._ .v.’--A_,—..<,~. h -r

VVB - Status of the population seems
to be pretty secure. There were three

‘to four litters in the Toklat Riverpack,

last year; 32 wolves in the pack this
winter. The East End pack there, in
the old SaVage pack territory, has 11,
with an offshoot of four more farther
north. And farther to the west, those
packs seem to be doing ﬁne. So I think
the status of the population is good.
And some of the aerial shooting.

incidents seem to have declined in the

last few years. Possibly because the

_ word of ,the research has spread. gf

There’s a lot of ﬂying going on,

monitoring those packs. So some of -_

the illegal huntinglhas dropped off.

AWA .- Do you see anything disturbing .

in the more recent behavior of wolves
along the Denali park road? Is that
just a factorof perhaps a larger wolf
population, that; they’re being seen
more along the road? Or are they
becomingmore accustomed to vehicles
and people?

road, certainly not on the road. You
might see them on the side of the road.
Now you see wolves on the road,

' oblivious to people and cars, and I

guess that’s a function of just pure
habituation. Some of those wolves have
learned that people aren’t going to hurt
them. It probably took a long time to
do that because, as recently as early
’SOs or maybe even mid-’SOs, wolves

were being shot. So it took a number '

of years for some of those animals to
settle down and habituate to people.
Even the wolves in the old Savage pack.
They call it the Headquarters pack now
but it’s really Savage pack territory.
Those wolves are relatively tame. I’ve
seen them, this Fall, the whole pack a
short way, off road, sharing a moose
carcass with a bear, alpha male near
the road. They were howling, etc.—
They occasionally wander out to the
highway and get shot at, or trapped, so
there’s some inﬂuence tolkeep them
from being super tame. But they’re
relatively tame.

AWA - Do you look at that as being an
overall positive or negative development
- that wolves are being seen more in
the park? '

VVB - I don’t have strong opinions on
that. The negative that I sometimes
worry about is that -- even though the
chances are very slim, but still poSsible
-- somebody getting bittenby a wolf. I
personally would like to see some of
those totally habituated wolves a little
less habituated. To me, my own
personal sense of the way things should
be is a little offended, seeing a wolf

l - caribou somewhere. It just kind of
g; l . takes away something from the image
if of the wolf to see them doing that.

AWA - Do wolves using Denali need

greater protection, both inside and

outside the park? If so, what could be
7 done there?

 

VVB - The Park Service announced
that it was going to beef up its patr’bls,
and they did that and bought
themselves a plane for the first time
and got pilots. The research started
about thesame time. The presence has
been pretty high; we need to maintain
that presence. When the research is
done, you need to put the word out that
you’re patrolling. Potential poachers
need to believe that, and if they do,
they will tend not to try to poach
wolves.

 

Outside the park, one of the prime
reasons for doing that research was to

try to determine what the wolf
- " .movements were. In years past, the
4*" , chances of poachers being caught in
14:5; winter were nil. There is a lot of

country to patrol.

AWA - Drawing upon your experience

 

' hOpe that . they would.
accommodate any recommendations to

outside the physical boundaries of
Denali should the research show that
.. wolf packs do roam both in and out of
the park itself?

WB - I think the chances are slim.
There is a feeling that once an animal
ventures outside the border of the park,
. _ he’s fair game. There is a very
; . . common belief among a lot of people
that the parks are reservoirs of wolves
and I’ve heard about this for years. In
Unit 13, Oscar Vogel wrote a story on
his trapping experience and referred to
catching wolves that were coming out of
Denali. He maintained these wolves
were raised in Denali, and this wave
would come out each year. I still hear

Wolves.

My feeling is that a Board of Game
would tend to say, ’we’ve got lots of
wolves in the parks; if a few come out,
they can be trapped’. ‘

 

AWA - How would you characterize
the overall status of wolf, bear, moose,
caribou and sheep populations in
Denali? Are there any trends there
that are apparent toyou?

VVB - I honestly don’t know what the
trends are fer sheep there51 know that
sheep were apparently increasing in the
’early ’805. Frank Singer was doing
surveys; sheep were increasing.
Caribou are somewhere around 3,000,
up from 1,500 in mid-’705 and
increasing. The bear population is high
and stable, the same density for the last
20 years. ‘

Once again, The Alaska Wildlife
Alliance is looking for volunteers willing
to spend two weeks this summer in
beautiful Glacier Bay National Park,
observing endangered humpback whales
-- and seals, sea lions, orcas, bald
eagles, black bears, and many sea birds
and other types of wildlife. Each year
the Alliance monitors whale behavior,
whale numbers, ' and vessel trafﬁc
impacts on whales within the bay. The

Alliance is working hard to see to it
that humpback whales in Glacier Bay
receive maximum protection by the

Second Meeting of the Wolf Planning—
Team Held in Anchorage

As reported in the last newsletter, a
team of people appointed by the
Division of Wildlife Conservation
(DWC) is conducting a series of
meetings in an attempt to develop
policy goals for wolves throughout the
state. The team, which includes Valerie
Brown, Executive Director of The
Alaska Wildlife Alliance, met on
January 11 and 12 in Anchorage. '

The purpose of this meeting was to
hear presentations about enforcement,

economics and biology. Phil. Gilson of

the Alaska State Department of Public
Safety and Al Crane, a US. Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS) enforcement

agent discussed illegal hunting activity

and the amount of enforcement
personnel in the ﬁeld. The state has 87
wildlife enforcement ofﬁcers statewide,
and this number includes ofﬁcers who
cannot spend a lot of time in the ﬁeld.
The FWS has nine enforcement agents
for the whole state.

’Mr. Crane speciﬁcally addressed the

 

federal~ Airborne Hunting Act and

'same-day-airborne hunting that is
authorized under state law. He stated
that probably about 95% of all same-
day-airborne (land-and-shoot) hunting
activity is illegal under the Airborne
Hunting Act. Dr. Vic Van
Ballenberghe, a wildlife biologist invited
to make a presentation to the panel,
also stressed the abuses that occur
under the state’s same-day-airborne
hunting law which allows hunters to
locate, land and ﬁre on wolves.

Four wolf biologists, Bob Stephenson,
Rod Boertje, Gordon Haber and Vic
Van Ballenberghe, wrote summary
papers for the team and gave oral
presentations at the meeting» on wolf
biology and predator / prey relationships.
The team began to outline the form of
the ﬁnal report and areas where all
members could. agree. Further
discussion and debate will take place at
the next meeting on February 8 and 9
in Anchorage at the Best Western,

Barrat Inn. Written public testimony
can be submitted at any time and oral

testimony will be taken at later

meetings. Meetings will also be held on
March 8, .9, 10 in Fairbanks; March 21,

__ 22, 23 in Anchorage; and April 26, 27 in

Anchorage. Public testimony . will
probably be scheduled on March 9 and
March 21.

Those people who wish to follow the
process and provide public comments
either in person or in writing should ask

‘to be placed on the mailing list to

receive meeting summaries. Write or
call Dale Koohlmoos at ADF&G, 333
Raspberry Road, Anchorage, AK 99508,
907—267-2267. You can also obtain
mere information about the location of
the meetings or the time of the public
hearings from Dale closer to the dates
of those meetings. The Board of Game
is going to consider all wolf hunting and

‘ trapping regulations in thestate at their

November, 1991 meeting. This public
process is an important part of that
board meeting. Take the time to
review the meeting summaries and
provide your comments about wolves in
Alaska to the Wolf Planning Team.

Kenai Peninsula Lynx Population

In Danger

. By Stephen Wells

Once again, the combined
mismanagement of the U. S. Fish &
Wildlife Service (FWS) and the Alaska
Department of Fish & Game

(ADF&G) has caused a drastic decline:

in the population of another one of
Alaska’s most magniﬁcent creatures -—
this time, the lynx.

The FWS knows why numbers are low,
but then, they knew that the population
‘ was being ravaged ﬁve years ago, and
refused to listen to their own biologists
and prevent this decline. A good
. example of this is the management
ﬁasco which occurred when, in. 1985, a
team of FWS biologists warned that the
lynx population on the Kenai National
Wildlife Refuge (KNWR) was being
"overexploited" by "an intense, persistent
and prolonged harvest that exceeded
the capacity of the lynx population to
compensate for natural and human
mortality...". Despite this and other
warnings, FWS management ofﬁcials
caved in to pressure from 11 few local
trappers and the ADF&G, refusing to
close the refuge and causing more lynx
to be killed.

Finally, FWS closed Game
ManagementUnit (GMU) 15A in the
northern part of the refuge to lynx
trapping, and reduced the trapping
season from 126 to 47 days in the other
two GMU’s on the refuge, 15B and
15C. The closure of one unit and not

  

nonluzans .
- their effoffsT'i'n 15B and
15C. The result was that despite the
shorter season, the lynx kill in 15B
alone increased from 21 to 24.

So in effect, FWS shifted the problem
from one GMU to another. This
naturally resulted in the same problems
deveIOping on the rest of the refuge.
This was evidenced by the percentage
of kittens in the kill of lynx in GMU
15B. The percentage of kittens in the
kill in a given area is used by biologists
as a gauge of the health of the lynx
population in that area. The

ed trappers _

6

percentage dropped from 43% (’83- -84),
to 37% (’84- -,85) to 21% (’85- 86). The
Alaska Wildlife Alliance believes that
this method 15 objectionable because: 1)
Lynx kittens are far more likely to be
trapped than adults, and 2) it is simply
misguided science to assume that

because many of a given animal are kglosed. It wasn’.t The season opened

killed, many more must remain. Due -/
these ﬁndings, FWS biologists

.recommended that the ’86—87 trapping

season not be opened because "Lynx

are being removed almost twice as fast

7 as they are being added to the

population."

A further recommendation submitted.
by the KNWR staff on October “9,
1986 and obtained by the Alliance
through a Freedom of Information Act
request stated: "Data collected this
summer and over the past four years on "
the Kenai NWR indicates that 1)
Refuge snowshoe hare populations [the
primary food of lynx in Alaska] are
declining"; 2) Lynx productivity and
densities are declining in GMU 15B; 3)
Lynx habitat remains unoccupied in
GMU 15B; 4) Some resident lynx in
GMU 15B are beginning to abandon
traditionally used areas prObably in
search of areas of more abundant prey;

5) Recruitment into the GMU 15B lynx

population may be declining; and 6)
Mortality is probably exceeding
recruitment of lynx into GMU 15B."

”It continued,h'-'Beeause of these factors
' and in the best interests of the refuge

lynx population, it is recommended that
the lynx hunting and trapping season be
temporarily closed in GMU 15B... By
taking this action now, we hope to.
prevent a situation from developing in
GMU 15B that repeats the series of
events that occurred in GMU 15 .
The recommendation concluded, "If
more time passes before taking any
effective action in GMU 15B on the
refuge, the lynx population will probably
be seriously impacted. Such a delay in‘
management action is neither supported
by the available information, nOr is it

as scheduled on December 15,1986,
and stayed Open for 28 days, until the
FWS ﬁnally issued an emergency
closure. During those 28 days, 23 more
lynx were sacriﬁced to bungling
mismanagement. _ .

The Alliance was instrumental 'n

bringing pressure to bear on the FWS
to close the season early that year, and
in maintaining the pressure to close the
remaining Kenai Peninsula GMU’s and
,to keep them closed. All of the Kenai
season opened, and has remained
closed since then.

Unfortunately, the lynx population has
yet to recover in numbers on

the Kenai, and the outlook is not
encouraging. It is pathetic that the
agency entrusted with the responsibility
of managing. our National Wildlife
Refuges for the beneﬁt of all
Americans can be so easily swayed by

Holy Cross, Alaska, were convicted, of
illegal aerial wolf hunting last year in
western ,Alaska, approximately 350

, miles northwest of Anchorage. Alaska

State Troopers found ﬁve fresh killsites
and" were able to track Peltola’s
airplane by the ski tracks it left in the

Troopers found 15 wolf hides; holes in
the backs of the hides indicated that the
wolves had been shot from the air.

' None of the men had a permit to" aerial

hunt wolves.

Peltola received a sentence of ten days
in jail and .a $1,000 ﬁne. His 5
and airplane were forfeited to the State 1
of Alaska and he is prohibited from

for three years.

Aloysius and Kinegak admitted to being

wolves from the ﬂying aircraft, and each

that are prosecuted and convicted (or
plead guilty to a lesser offense to avoid

get suspended sentences. Professional
guides, caught conducting illegal hunts,
have had their guiding privileges only
temporarily revoked. And hunters who
violate the law usually lose their hunting
privileges for only one or two years. ’

Those who repeatedly abuse hunting

prohibited from hunting. And guides
who do not conduct their business
lawfully should have their guiding--

would be barred from practice for
ﬂagrant violation of laws governing
their professions. Wildlife enforcement
will not be an effective deterrent unless
violators are prosecuted, those

convicted receive ﬁnes and jail time,

the laws developed to protect wilder

Anti-Poaching Video is a Sleeper

by Kim Behrens ’

The U.S. Fish and _Wildlife Service '

(USFWS) recently produced an
"Innovative Sentencing" video aimed at
* deterring rampant poaching of the
nation’s wildlife. The 30-minute self-
congratulatory video begins with dry
interviews and statements from
enforcement personnel, U.S.
magistrates and probation ofﬁcers who
'mumble about "needing to send a
message" to poachers.
thoroughly enlightened now, they talk of
revoking hunting privileges, jail time
and confiscation and forfeiture of
equipment for serious violations. The
show then "moves" (if anyone is still
awake) to the highlights: "spontaneous"

who have seen the errors of their past ,

Ways. Convicted poachers smile as they
recount their illicit activities and list
their trophy animals killed illegally, and
as they say "ain’t it time we paid
attention to the rules". Ron Hayes, a
notorious Alaskan big-game guide
convicted of hunting grizzly bears with
airplanes, reminisces about his

adventure building a hunting lodge in'

the Wrangell-St. Elias mountains, taking
people on 15-day hunts that today
would bring $20,000. Then he laments
that appearing in the video'is costing
him, personally, $3,000. to $4,000! Is
this to convince watchers, indeed

to preservation of the resource?
Rather than sincere regret, what we see
are people who are sorry they were
caught. We can be sure any would-be
poachers. who might watch the video
are not being deterred; rather they are

smugly gloating, knowing that they are

better thieves than those on the screen.

Indeed, violators are referred to as "folk.

herOes" by one man. And, they may
even get a few pointers from the
"experts".

serious effect illegal hunting has on

there will be any positive impact from

i the new video. No one knows just how

prevalent violations in Alaska are, but
wildlife managers acknowledge that they
need to be curbed. Certainly,
enforcement of wildlife laws is critical.
But given Alaska’s vast wild areas,
minimal enforcement personnel -- nine
federal enforcement officers "for
Alaska’s approximately 591,000 square
miles, or over 65,000 square miles per
ofﬁcer -- and the money that. big—game
guides stand to gain from providing
clients with that prepaid moose, sheep,
goat, grizzly or wolf, much more needs
to be done than produce a poorly
made, sleeper of a video. The phony
feel-good incentive for hanging up one’s
evil ways, or turning in cohorts, just
isn’t very powerful.

scope to include other parties such as
banks, industries, small and medium-
sized enterprises. A wider partnership
of this kind could facilitate the develop-
ment and conversion of specific
regions.

In addition, the regional

representatives pointed out the impor- _

tance of improvements in the research
and development fields in order to
boost the productivity of traditionally
industrial areas. Technological innova-
tion, focusing particularly on
promoting small and medium-sized
enterprises and developing internatio-
nal and interregional cooperation will
also be given top priority in future
development. One of the most impor-

tant aspects of industrial reconstruction
must, however, include the social, cultu-
ral and training dimensions, they
continued.

Mr Mil/an, for his part, also
emphasised the significant timing of this
meeting which falls just before the
second phase of implementation of the
Structural Funds’ reform programme and
in the middle of preparations to consoli-
date economic and social cohesion within
the Community. In this respect, more
action is still required, claimed the
Commissioner. Mr Mil/an also supported
the notion of including an urban dimen-
sion to the Objective 2 funding although
this could require an increase in
resources.

ANIMAL WELFARE: EEC MINIMUM STANDARDS PROPOSED

FOR 2005

After wide-ranging consultations with specialists from
zoos, wildlife protection organisations and animal welfa-
. re associations, the European Commission approved on
July 10 a propOsal fora framework Directive fixing the

. objectives of mInImum standards, which must be defined
by Member States. for the protection of animals In zoos.

" Duly". 1991 EuromeeporNMCV)

According to this frame-
work Directive, the 1, 000 or so zoos in
the European Community will have to
obtain an operating licence granted
after an inspection visit ascertaining
that the zoo has adequate installations
to care for and house its animals and

that real efforts have been made to

promote the role of zoos in education,
at least on matters concerning the envi-

. ronment, scientific research and the

conservation of endangered species.

This new measure
responds to the urgent need to adopt
uniform welfare standards throughout
the Community, need felt by professio-
nals of zoos and wildlife protection
organisations and the general public.
Moreover, it is now obvious that the
current discrepancies between different

national legislation risks compromising
the effective implementation of
Community II‘II'I"IdIife conservation legia—sl
tion, namely with regard to the
regulation of the trade of endangered
species (under the CITES: Convention on
International Trade in Endangered
Species and Wild Fauna and Flora).

According to European
I Environment Commissioner Carlo Ripa di
EMeana, it will in future be impossible to
Shut up these wild animals in concrete
prisons. EEC zoos will not only have to
house their animals in an environment
suitable to their behavioural needs but
also positively work towards conservation
efforts. it is estimated that at least half
of the EEC’s zooswill have to make
improvements in order to comply with
these' new standards. It is an excellent
initiative, for the protection of nature is
an essential component of the environ:
mental policy and zoological gardens
have a symbolic meaning under the new
relationships emerging between men and
nature. ' ‘

 




Dave’s Quarterly piece on the IWC

THE IWC - BROKEN PROMI§ES THREATE! ALL WHALES AﬂD DOLPHINS

A report by Dave Currey on behalf of AWI and EIA

The cold Icelandic breeze blew right through this year’s IWC meeting
in Reykjavik. There seemed to be renewed fighting spirit from
countries wishing to block efforts on small whales, dolphins and
porpoises, as well as a battle cry from the Whalers.

Iceland’s Threats

Iceland finally carried out its threat to leave the Commission after
years of rhetoric and backdown. But even now, they have until next
year’s meeting to show if they are genuinely prepared to walk.

However, they cannot resume whaling if they are not members of the
Commission unless they are prepared to destroy their most valuable
export - sales of fish to the USA and Europe. They would also
jeopardize their proposed entry into the European Community. ‘Pirate’
whaling would destroy Iceland’s economy.

A Step Towards Resuming Commercial Whaling

It was a'sad year for all whales, dolphins and porpoises. The
countries usually expected to fight to save the whales were pushed
into a corner and showed their true colors. Only New Zealand lived up
to the challenge by openly stating that they~didn’tlwant to seeﬁanyﬁ-
whales killed, and thatﬁhﬁs the will of their people: « *':W'~’ﬁrq:,ag

Unfortunately, such courage was in short supply. The US and most
European countries backed the imposition of a ‘Revised Management
Procedure’ which could lead to the resumption of commercial whaling in
the next few years. Their rationale was that it was the best they
could get. We disagree. It seems that the representatives from these
countries forgot "the will of their people" and they compromised their
position.

The "Revised Management Procedure" lays down the parameters for
resumed commercial whaling. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the
position taken by the US and most European Countries is that it allows
for 46% of the original populations of whales to be exterminated
before the operations have to be ‘sustainable’.

There is more work to be done by the scientists before quotas could be
set, but it is important to point out that the species for which it
would be the easiest to set a quota in the very near future is the
California Grey whale, should someone want to exploit it again.

 




What Are We Fighting For?

Sadly, and inexplicably, this proposal was supported by many animal
welfare and conservation organizations. Like the Commissioners, they
were persuaded it was the best they could get. AWI and EIA could not
support this position because our bottom line is we do not want whales
to be killed. If this Procedure is the best we could get, we don’t
want anything.

We are confident our members and the general public, both here in the
US and in Europe, are of the same opinion. Why then were so many
people at the meeting prepared to accept defeat so easily and support
a measure, the consequence of which is clearly unacceptable to the
vast majority of people? The Procedure is complex. Discussions with
commissioners revealed that even after the vote, many of them did not
understand it. Maybe this is the reason they supported it!

This disappointing lack of confidence in public support seems
indefensible. The public have shown time and time again that they do
not want to see whaling or the killing of dolphins.

The success of the ‘dolphin friendly’ tuna campaign demonstrates the
power of the consumer, and whaling countries should remember this.
After all, Norway and Iceland need to sell their fish and Japan relies
on its exports of cars and electronics.

A Sell—out for the Smaller Whales

Small whales, dolphins and porpoises had a rough time as well. Two
important resolutions were withdrawn by the US at the last moment to
avoid a vote. Both would have passed with little outright opposition -
countries against the resolutions would have abstained at the vote.,
For some inexplicable reason the Commissioners were looking for V3;
consensus.

Driftnets

The first resolution to be withdrawn endorsed the United nations
resolution to ban high seas driftnets by 1992. Unforgivably, this was
opposed by the European Community because it highlighted the expansion
of driftnetting in the NorthEast Atlantic and Mediterranean. The UK
was adamantly opposed which Caused considerableﬁstir in the British
press. Coincidentally, four British Fishermen had just imported 4 mile
long nets which are longer than the 1. 5 mile maximum length allowed in
other parts of the world.

A Raw Deal For Dolphins

The other important resolution that was withdrawn broke new ground.

Its withdrawal represents a major setback for dolphins worldwide. It
focussed on 5 endangered species including the Mexican Vaquita, the
Indus River dolphin and the Yangtze River dolphin. No more than 300-a?55

 




O

of each of these three species are thought to survive.

Unbelievably, the UK and Australia persuaded the US Commissioner to
withdraw the resolution at the last minute, despite it having twelve
countries sponsoring it. They claim they can table it next year. For
the species it aimed to help, next year may be too late.

This shift towards seeking consensus on these issues allows one
disruptive commissioner to block progress. This year it was Brazil

Scientific Committee’s Small Cetaceans Report

One resolution on small whales, dolphins and porpoises was adopted by
consensus. This asked the IWC Secretary to forward the Scientific
Committee’s excellent report on small cetaceans to those countries
named in the report. It also asked that the report be sent to the
United Nations Conference on Environmental Development (UNCED) which

will take place next June in Brazil.

Iceland’s Whale Meat Scam

' promise to only export
49% of the meat from their ‘Scientific whaling’ Programme.
Calculations made from available evidence showed that at least 58% and
maybe as much as 77% of the meat had been exported to Japan.
The accusations we immediately dismissed by the Icelandic AW ﬂy»;
Government, but thﬁﬁ failed to provide counter evidence. Theytclaimn

No Interim or Scientific Whaling Quotas

Japan and Iceland failed to get interim quotas for whales under
Japan’s own category ‘small type coastal whaling’ which is an
alternative way of describing commercial coastal whaling. Also
requests for approval of ‘Scientific Whaling’ programmes by Japan and
USSR were turned down.

 




Bowhead Whales

The US succeeded in gaining an increased quota for the number of
Bowhead whales Inuitﬁs in Alaska are permitted to strike. The number
they are permitted to actually kill remains the same. It sounds
complicated and it is. AWI and EIA see no justifiable reason for the

increase in the number of strikes and will be watching to see that
this aboriginal kill is not expanded in the future.

The Singing Commissioner

Perhaps the most entertaining and prophetic moment came at an evening
of opera and light entertainment with the Icelandic Opera Company. The
Icelandic Commissioner selfwconsciously sang his heart out as a member
of the chorus, and a good time was had by all. The rendering of ‘My
Way’ demonstrated a stubbornness and tenacity that was not equalled by
supposedly whale-friendly countries.

The champagne reception provided an atmosphere of bonhomie that does
not bode well for the whales and dolphins. Let’s not delude‘
ourselves- the killing of dolphins continues unabated, and commercial
whaling is set to start up again.

The Save the Whale movement must make itself heard all over again ##
but this time the battlecry must include the dolphins. Before it’s too

late.

The Reverend J. George Butler, author of the article,
"The Jaws of Hell," published in Theughrismianugentury, has
contributed historical information on the genesis of the steel
jaw leghold trap and the strange hold it has exercised over the
years on a small minority of the population. Reverend Butler
writes:

The_.C.r_u§_l.ty_9f. Christi. an .Ber f e ct i oni 5: t s

"John Humphrey Noyes, whose steel jaw leghold trap became
the standard trap of the world, was a Christian perfectionist.
Not once did it ever enter his head that his Oneida Community,
which he thought was a sinless society, was perpetrating such
heinous sins against the animal kingdom.

"Noyes was born in Brattleboro, Vermont in 1811. After
Dartmouth, he went to Yale Divinity School. There he had a
vision of his own sinlessness. If one could abolish selfishness,
he could achieve perfection. That became his life's mission.

"Noyes was a charismatic figure, a magnetic man who
quickly gathered a loyal band of followers. Setting up first in
Putney, Vermont, above Brattleboro in the Connecticut River
valley, Noyes met violent opposition from the good peOple of
Putney. Noyes applied the New Testament doctrine of 'having all

things common' to marriage. The ultimate selfishness, said

Noyes, was the ownership of wives. Hence he devised 'complex

 




marriage.‘ In reality this became the first scientific
experiment in stirpiculture——selective breeding for the
improvement of the race. Noyes himself sired over forty progeny.
Dolts, on the other hand, were allowed only one child.

"Noyes' radical ideas did not sit well in Vermont, so
Noyes took his band of a couple hundred followers to the
wilderness of Western New York and settled on the shores of
Oneida Creek. There, his Oneida Community became America's most
successful communal society of the XIXth century.

"At first, Noyes and his followers tried agriculture.

They nearly starved to death. In 1849, however, the fortunes of

the Oneida Community changed. .Noyes converted Sewall Newhouse to

his brand of Christianity. Newhouse was a blacksmith and a
trapper who had invented the perfect trap, the steel jaw leghold
trap. He made it in six sizes, small ones for mink, the largest
for bear. And it worked in all conditions; hot or cold, under
water or on dry land. Noyes immediately saw the potential of
this trap for his community. He built a factory on the shores of
Oneida Creek and harnessed its waters to mass produce the Oneida-
Newhouse trap. So successful was Noyes as a businessman in
marketing this trap, that for seventy years the Hudson Bay
Company would sell no other. When Secretary of State William
Seward purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867, Noyes sent him a
specially polished trap in appreciation, because of the vast
market this Opened for his traps.

"Back in the XVIIth century, Rene Descartes posited his

 




animal machine theory. Animals are simply machines. They can't

speak: therefore, they can't think. Hence they feel no pain.

In short, they were just machines. Unfortunately, this sophistry

obtained not only in Noyes' day, but is still rampant in our day.
In the XIXth century, Henry Bergh, the founder of the first
humane society in the United States, failed to see the dichotomy
of his stopping a teamster for abusing his horse, while clad from
head to toe in furs from animals tortured in steel jaw leghold
traps.

"It is still amazing to witness the callous indifference
of so many to the outrageous cruelty of this fiendish device. In
1975, Congressman Glenn Anderson of California, and Senator Birch
Bayh of Indiana tried to obtain legislation to outlaw these 'Jaws
of Hell.‘ Hearings were finally held, but the bill died with the
end of that session of Congress.

"Once again, Congressman James Scheuer of New York has
introduced Federal legislation to ban the leghold trap. What can
you do to make America a 'kinder, gentler' nation? Over forty
countries have already outlawed this cruelty. Why not the United
States? In 1975, Ihe_ChristianﬂQentury published my article,
'The Jaws of Hell.‘ I sent a copy to Pierpont T. Noyes,
President and Chairman of Oneida Ltd., Silversmiths, the
successor corporation to the Oneida Community. I said, in part:
'. . . the Christian Perfectionists of the Oneida Community saw

no incompatibility between manufacturing their trap, and their

Christian beliefs, but neither did anyone else, then.'

 




"Noyes responded immediately. '. . . I never even
thought that there might be a moral issue about game traps made
by a 'sinless society' . . .'

"The time has come for America to open its eyes to the

outrageous cruelty these traps inflict."

Dear Member,

A few weeks ago you should have “received state of Board membership and a call for
nominations in those regions where there will be vacancies by the end of 11991. Pic, 9239 note
that the last Annual General Meeting approved changes to the distribution of Board ritembers.
as follows:

Africa - 4 positions
(West Africa)

(East and Central Africa)
(Southern Africa)

(Arab region)

Asia/Pacific - 4 positions

Europe - East/West - 3 positions

Latin America - 3 positions

(Caribbean 1)

(Central America 1)

(South America 1)

North America - 2 positions

Accordingly now that ample time for correcting minutes has elapsed, the following regions will
have to nominate additional contestants:

- Africa 1 to total 1 (from the Arab region)
- Asia 1 to total 3 (one from the Pacific)

Accordingly, too, there will be no nominations from North America who now hold two positions.
These will not fall vacant until 1992 and 1993.

l am enclosing another nomination form for your use and a list of reﬁning Board of Directors
tor your information.

Yours sincerely,

INTERNATIONALWHALING COMMISSION

 

Iceland sharpens its harpoons

London

A RESUMPTION of commercial whaling is in
prospect after Iceland’s chief delegate to the
International Whaling Commission (IWC),
Gudmunder Eriksson, said he will advise his
government to leave the organization. Ice-
land’s withdrawal from the IWC, which
could take effect from 30 June 1992, would
leave its whaling ﬂeet free to hunt minke
and fin whales in the
central North Atlantic,
irrespective of the wishes
of the IWC.

The IWC imposed a
ban on commercial whal-
ing in 1986 when it was
realised that the tech-
nique used by the com-
mission to calculate catch
quotas was seriously
ﬂawed: whale stocks
could be depleted even by
catches sanctioned by the
IWC. Iceland grudgingly
accepted this argument,
but Norway and Japan,
the other two main whal-
ing nations, continued
commercial hunting for
another two seasons.

Iceland’s strongest
threat yet to leave the
commission came in the
closing minutes of an acrimonious IWC
annual meeting, held in Reykjavik, Iceland,
last week. Icelandic delegates were angered
by what they saw as a deliberate attempt by
the majority of anti—whaling nations within
the IWC to delay the implementation of a
“revised management procedure”, devised
by the IWC’s scientific committee (see
Nature 351, 259; 23 May 1991). This pro—
cedure (essentially a mathematical model
based on whale population dynamics)

 

 

should allow the setting of commercial catch
quotas that do not endanger whale popula-
tions — at least for some stocks of the rela-
tively numerous minkes. The IWC also
refused to consider an Icelandic request to
allow “interim” commercial catches of
minke and fin whales over the coming year.

The IWC agreed to adopt the manage-
ment procedure put forward by its scientists,

Japanese Embassy London: Greenpeace’s memorial to whales killed since 1986.

even though this was seen as the first step
towards the resumption of commercial
whaling within the IWC, which most IWC
members wish to prevent. But a resolution
put forward by a hard—core group of nine
anti-whaling nations — Australia, Finland,
Germany, Oman, the Netherlands, the Sey-
chelles, Switzerland, Britain and the United
States — contains a number of caveats that
will restrict the use of the procedure to set
catch quotas.

 

 

The resolution, passed by 18 votes to six,
also asks the IWC’s scientific committee to
do more work to reﬁne the procedure. The
Icelandic delegation believes that the anti-
whaling nations will use uncertainty over the
precise size of whale stocks, and the positions
of the boundaries between them, as an
excuse to delay the resumption of commer—
cial whaling within the IWC.

The Icelandic cabinet must now weigh the
advantages of resuming commercial whaling
outside the IWC against the threat of econ-

omic sanctions from the

United States. Under

fisheries legislation, the

US Administration can

impose sanctions on

countries endangering
O whale populations.
Norway is also now
reconsidering its mem-
bership of the IWC.

Japan, while expressing

disappointment about the

IWC’s decision, has made

no immediate threat to

leave. The Japanese hope
that, if the revised man-
agement procedure is
implemented next year,
they will be given IWC
quotas to catch minkes in

Antarctica, where stocks

are much larger than the

North Atlantic popula-

tions that Iceland and
Norway wish to hunt.

But that hope may be optimistic. Next
year’s IWC meeting is in Glasgow, Scotland,
and British public opinion is set firmly
against whaling. The British government is
expected to oppose a resumption of whaling
on humane grounds, irrespective of the con-
servation issue, arguing that no humane
method of killing whales exists. Many other
IWC nations are expected to support this
stand. PeterAldhous

THE threatened fragmentation of the WC,
and with it the return of commercial whaling,
is a major disappointment for the environ—
mentalist lobby, which had counted the lWC

But for environmentalist groups, the
battle was lost not so much in last week’s
meeting ofthe fuli lWC, but rather during the
two~week meeting of the lWC’s scientific
committee that preceded it. Once the lWC’s
scientists had chosen a single management
procedure from the five they were consid—
ering, a clash between the anti-whaling lWC
members and the whaling nations was in-

body, is a forum influenced by political hid—

Greens in disarray after committing a tactical blunder

The anti—whaling members of the scien-
tific committee had hoped the committee
would be unable to choose between the five
rival management procedures. Sidney Holt,
scientific adviser to the Seychelles lWC
delegation, says that all five procedures
should have been put forward tothe full lWC,
with an explanation of each provided by the
scientific committee. The choice of a single
procedure “was a policy one, not a scientific
one,” he says.

But most committee members decided
that the procedure developed by Justin
Cooke, a British mathematician now work-
ing in Germany, was superior to the other
four on offer —— giving the best balance
between protecting whale populations from
depletion, maximizing catches and ensuring
that catch quotas do not vary wildly from
year to year.

Shocked by this development, a small
group of anti—whaling scientists, ironically

including Cooke himself, objected to the
selection of Cooke’s procedure. If a single
procedure was to be chosen, they said, it
should be that deveioped by Bill de la Mare,
an Australian who now works in the Nether-
lands. Among the five candidate manage-
ment procedures, de la Mare’s piaces the
highest priority on the protection of whale
stocks from depletion, and would delay the
resumption of catches from heavily
depleted populations for several decades.
But the pleas of the antiwhaling scientists
wereto no avail,and Cooke’s procedure was
put forward to the full lWC.

by Dave Currey of The Environmental Investigation Agency I

The cold Icelandic breeze blew right through this year's IWC
meeting in Reykjavik. There seemed to be renewed fighting spirit
from countries wishing to block efforts for small whales, dolphins
and porpoises, as well as a battle cry from the Whalers. Iceland
finally carried out its threat to leave the Commission after years
of rhetoric and backdowns. But even now, they have until next
year’s meeting to show if they are genuinely prepared to walk.

It was a sad year for all whales, dolphins and porpoises. The
countries usually eXpected to fight to save the whales were pushed
into a corner and showed their colors. Only New zealand lived up
to the challenge by openly stating that they did not want to see
any whales killed, and that was the will of their people.

Unfortunately, such courage was in short supply. The US and most
European countries backed a "revised management procedure" which
will lead to the resumption of commercial whaling in the next few
years. Their rationale was that it was the best they could get. We
disagree. In fact it seems that "the will of the people" has been
forgotten and these countries are compromising their position.

The "revised management procedure" lays down the parameters for
resumed commercial whaling. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of
the position taken by the Us and most EurOpean countries is that
it allows for 46% of the original populations of whales to be
exterminated before the operations have to be "sustainable". sadly,
and inexplicably, this proposal was lobbyed for by many of the non
governmental organisations (NGO's). Once again, because it was the

best they thought they could get. EIA did not support this
aposition.

-“4”?9Thiseraises*theVTssueVOI“the*function%OfWNGO’s*at“such”meetings.

It seemed that too many people were, prepared to accept defeat
<ﬁbefore putting their case. We areﬁsure.that the public support a
“continued ban on whaling, and this Should be the unadulterated

position of NGO's. It’s up to the Commissioners to compromise — if
they dare. ‘

This disappointing lack of confidence in public support seems
indefensible. The public have shown again and again that they do
not want to see whaling or the killing of dolphins. The success of
the "dolphin friendly" tuna campaign demonstrates the power of the
moonsuner,~and-whaling~countries~shouldwremember“this.”After'all,
Norway and Iceland want to sell their fish and.Japan relies on its

 




export of cars and electronics. ~  

Small whales, dolphins and porpoises had a rough time as well. Two
important resolutions were withdrawn by the US at the last moment
to avoid a vote. Both wOuld have passed with little outright

opposition, but the Commissioners were looking for consensus.

The first.was a resolution endorsing the United Nations resolution
to ban high seas driftnets by 1992. Unforgiveably, this was opposed
by the EurOpean Community because it highlighted the expansion of
driftnetting in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean. The UK
was adamantly opposed which caused a considerable stir in the
British press. British fishermen had just imported 4 mile long
driftnets which are longer than.the‘maximum.length allowed in other
parts of the world (2.5km).

The other important resolution that was withdrawn broke new ground.
Its withdrawal represents a major set back for dolphins worldwide.
It focussed on 5 endangered species including the Mexican vaquita,
the Indus River dolphin, and the Yangtze River dolphin. No more
than 3-400 of each of these species are belieVed to survive. The
withdrawal of the resolution by the US was supported by the UK and
Australia at the last moment despite it having twelve countries
sponsoring it. They claimed that they would be able to table it
next year. For the species it was aimed to help, next year may be
too late.

This shift towards seeking consensus on these issues allows one
disruptive commissioner to block progress. This year it was Brazil
that stepped in to ensure that no progress was made to help
dolphins. The commissioner switched her position as it suited her
and damaged some excellent initiatives. Consensus politics at the
IWC will lead to commercial whaling and the extinction of one
species of dolphin after another.

One resolution on small whales, dolphins and porpoises was adopted
by consensus. This asked the IWC Secretary to forward the
Scientific Committee report on small cetaceans to those countries
in the report. It also asked that the report be sent to the United

‘ ' 5° mat-ions .itonference. ion theEnvironment .and Development .(UNCED). which

BIA released a report at the meeting accusing Iceland of having
cheated the US and the IWC by reneging on“their promise to only '
export 49% of the meat from their "scientific whaling" programme.

‘Calculations made from available evidence”showed.that at least sat-53.1.5}

andimaybe as much as 77% of the meat had been exported to Japan.
The ‘accusations were immediately dismissed by the Icelandic
government but they failed to provide any counter evidence. They
claim that they are now carrying out an enquiry. .;9

Japan,” the USSR and Iceland failed to get interim quotas for
whales, butthe’US " succeeded “ in ’--gaining sin-increased ...quota for
Bowhead whales killed by Inuits in Alaska. Discussions with
commissioners about the "revised management procedure” revealed

 




that even after the vote, many of them did not understand it.

Perhaps the most entertaining and prophetic moment came at an
evening* of Opera and ,light entertainment. when the Icelandic
Commissioner sang his heart out. A good time was had by all, but
the rendering of "My Way" demonstrated a stubborness and tenacity
that was not equalled by the supposedly whale-friendly countries.
The champagne reception provided an atmosphere of bonhomie that
does not bode well for the whales and dolphins. Let's not delude
ourselves - the killing of dolphins continues unabated, and
commercial whaling is set to start up again. The Save the Whale
movement has to make itself heard all over again - but this time
the battlecry must include the dolphins. Before its too late.

END.

Henry - Christine asked for this. Good luck in your pursuits. See
you soon I hope.

Dr. Lawrence Bartholf ﬂeﬂ) receives the ﬁrst
AVMA Animal Welfare Award from AVMA
President-elect, Dr. Gerald Johnson.

Lawrence Bartholf, DVM, a member
of the NYSVMS, was named the first re-
cipient of the Animal Welfare Award pre-
sented by the AVMA at their Animal
Welfare Forum, November 9, in Chicago.
Dr. Bartholf was instrumental in the rescue
and rehabilitation of hundreds of animals
in the nation’s largest animal cruelty case
in recent years -- the Animals Farm Home
case in Ellenville, New York.

Following a 1987 complaint from a
former employee of the Animals Farm
Home, the New York State Humane Asso-
ciation (NYSHA) and the Ulster County
District Attorney obtained a warrant and
conducted an unannounced inspection of
the premises. Dr. Bartholf participated in
the inspection to provide expert testimony
about the condition of the animals living
there.

Hundreds of animals, including cats,
dogs, horses, farm animals, wildlife, and
birds were living in a deplorable state:

Animals were unfed, no water was pro-
vided, sanitation was poor, and parasite
infestation and disease were rampant.
After the inspection, Dr.Bartholf worked
with humane groups to provide medical
care and treatment, saving hundreds of an-
imals and placing them for adoption.

“It would be impossible to
overstate Dr. Bartholf’s role
in the rescue and rehabilita-
tion of hundreds of animals in
this enormous and uniquely
challenging case. ”

Samantha Mullen of the New York
State Humane Association notes, “It
would be impossible to overstate Dr.
Bartholf ' s role in the rescue and reh abilita—
tion of hundreds of animals in this enor-
mous and uniquely challenging case. ...he
was an inspiration to the task force from the
humane community who worked along
side him...”

Dr. Bartholf, a 1965 Cornell graduate,
operates a large animal practice in Green—
field Park and is currently president-elect
of the Hudson Valley VMA. He has been
an SPCA volunteer veterinarian for more
than 15 years, serving in Sullivan and U1-
ster counties.

Recognizing that animal welfare is a
daily responsibility for veterinarians, the
AVMA initiated the Animal Welfare
Award to acknowledge veterinary com—
mitment to animal care. The Animal Wel-
fare Award is presented to a veterinarian
who has advanced animal well-being,
shown exemplary dedication to animal
care, and contributed to the community
and society.

for New York state but not for that

as “pretty progressive and very
animal oriented. "

Willard says that in New York

However through a program

Willard says that about 76 percent of

That number, he says. is up from

Pet-Neutering Law Approved

 

(AP) — Faced with too many stray
dogs and cats, the San Mateo County
Board of Supervisors has tentatively
approved the nation's first law that re-
quires nearly all pets to be neutered to
prevent unplanned litters.

the ordinance approved Tuesday
night would impose a moratorium on
all breeding by private dog and cat
owners for six months beginning in
.July.
3 After Jan. 1. 1992, only dogs and cats
owned by professional and hobbyist
breeders who hold special permits
would be allowed to reproduce. All
other cats and dogs in unincorporated
areas of the county, I5 miles south of
San Francisco, would have to be neu-
tered. Only about 10 percent of the

"We took an historic first step to-
ward soiving the animal overpopula-
tion problem," said Supervisor Tom
Nolan, who wrote the ordinance.

Mr. Nolan introduced the measure in
October after learning that the Penin-
sula Humane Society kills 10,000 strays
each year.

The board approved the ban by a
4-to-l vote after a four—hour hearing
that drew breeders from as far away
as the District of Columbia.

if approved on final reading next
Tuesday, the ordinance will become
law. A committee would set the rules
and fees for licensing professional and
hobby breeders. Violators would be
fined $500.

Policing the ordinance would be the
responsibility of the Humane Society's
animal control officers.

Activities since October board meetings:

. Participated, with Sue and Gordon, in presentation of NYSHA awards at NYS
Troopers Barracks, in East Greenbush.

. HSUS conference ~ $1,000 had been authorized for attendance; actual
expenses, $772. One of the highlights of attending conference: discussions
with several of the people involved in spearheading San Mateo County’s
proposed ordinance against breeding of cats and dogs. The proposed

ordinance, introduced primarily through the efforts of the Peninsula Humane
Society (San Mateo, CA), has greatly heightened awareness nationwide about
companion animal overpopulation, through widespread media coverage, both
televised and printed. Examples of the newspaper publicity given the proposed
legislative measure, are articles carried in the Albany Times—Union on
November 3, and The New YOrk Times on December 13 (Attachment 1).

. Met with the Development Committee twice (11/8, 11/28) and the Annual
Meeting Planning Committee (11/28). One of the development committee’s areas
of concentration was finalizing details of the year—end appeal letter mailed
this month to our entire mailing list of roughly 8,400, at a cost of
approximately $3,500.

. Attendance, on November 9, at AVMA’s Animal Welfare Forum (program:
Attachment 2), at which Dr. Lawrence Bartholf received the AVMA’s first annual
Animal Welfare Award. A video press release in which I was interviewed as
representing one of the two organizations (NYSHA and the Ulster County SPCA)
that had nominated Dr. Bartholf for the award, was shown at the award
ceremony. Several excellent speakers made presentations at the forum, which
in my opinion represented significant progress towards the goal of cooperation
between the veterinary community and the humane community.

. Tabled, dispensed literature at in Christmas Craft Fair sponsored by Ulster
County SPCA.

. Met with children’s literature specialist at SUNY, New Paltz, to discuss
future meeting with head of education department. The goal of such a meeting
is to develop interest in a course that would be included in the teacher
certification syllabus, on curriculum-blended humane education topics.

. We’ve received very positive responses re: letters Pat sent to publishers
notifying them of the NYSHA/Fund for Animals "Kind Writers Make Kind Readers"
award .

. I’ve been contacted by Frank Crocitto, president of Discovery Institute, in
New Paltz, who is interested in development of animal sanctuary and/or
educational facility for benefit of animals. I strongly encouraged him to
consider only the types of programs that would not involve the physical care
and housing of animals on the institute’s property.

. We’ve been contacted by Capitol Hill Management Services, of Albany, with an
offer to meet and explore the feasibility of collaborating on various aspects
of NYSHA administration. The Development Committee will try to follow up n
this soon, by meeting with the firm’s representatives.

I was contacted on two separate occasions by individuals who expressed their
dissatisfaction with the way the ASPCA is handling dog control, stray animals
in general, and humane law enforcement. In early November, Astra Dmitri,
representing Save the Animals/Save the Earth, sent me a copy of a proposal
entitled, "’Start Up’ Committee & Operational Outline for the First New York
City Council on Animal Affairs." In December, I received a phone call an
individual named Caro Alexanian, whose hostility towards the ASPCA was very
evident. He said he intended to take his complaints to the mayor, the
legislature, etc. (Steve — recommended ignoring both individuals with whom he
has had some contact, and doesn’t consider credible.)

. We’ve received excellent feedback from Animal Rights Information Service,
and from Sheltengense_about the donations NYSHA made to them, $100 and $500,
respectively. Our contribution to Shelter Sense purchased 62 one—year gift
subscriptions for shelter personnel within New York State. We were contacted
by Rhonda Lucas Donald, Shelter Sense editor, who would like to do an article
about NYSHA’s gift subscriptions to shelters throughout New York State, in
hopes that other state organizations will follow suit and.also sponsor
subscriptions to the magazine.

 

 

. We’ve received several inquiries from shelters, such as Ken’s (Hi—Tor Animal
Care Center, Pomona — Rockland County) and Dorothy’s (Central New York SPCA,
Syracuse — Rockland County) concerning the fact that, in rabies-designated
counties, dogs must be vaccinated against rabies prior to licensing/release.
This requirement creates very difficult logistical problems.

Bob Reder, of the Mid~Atlantic Regional Office of the HSUS, invited me to a
press conference held in Madison, NJ. on December 12, regarding HSUS’ call for
a consumer boycott of pet shops in puppy mills states. The HSUS has added
Pennsylvania to the list of states the HSUS has found to be the most involved
in puppy mill—type production, i.e, the following midwestern states: Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. I was unable to attend, but

different ways in which veterinarians are involved in en- ' ,

hancing animal and human well-being. In addition, the
forum will highlight contemporary issues in'animal welfare
which require the continued involvement of the veterinary
medical profession for‘their successful resolution. A panel of
outstanding speakers has been assembled to address the
forum, which should be of interest to veterinarians, veteri-
nary medical students, veterinary technicians, representa-
tives from the biomedical, animal agriculture, and humane
communities, and the media.

The Animal Welfare Forum will conclude with the presen-
tation of the first annual AVMA Animal Welfare Award to a
veterinarian who has advanced animal well-being and
shown exemplary dedication to animal care, and contrib-
uted to the community and society. The presentation will
feature a video news release of the winner's activities, and
will be followed by a reception honoring the award winner.

P.O. Box 3650

Dear Ms. Stevens;

I am writting you to bring to your attention the threat to
the killer whales that the logging of the Tsitika Valley
poses. The government here has seemingly become immune to the
need for meaningful public input. It appears from the
experience in Washington and Oregon that it was necessary for
the relevant US federal body to step in to establish
apprOpriate controls. The state authorities were too easily
manipulated by the very powerful forest industry to be truly
able to prOperly manage the woods for the good of the entire
community.

The enclosed tables reflect how poorly our entire forest
industry is managed. Even if the forest is viewed as nothing
more than a harvestable fiber (an all too frequent View), it
should at least be sold to the highest not the lowest bidder.
The surcharge of 15% duty recently imposed by the States on
imported B. C. forest products was to offset the unfair market
advantage such products had in the States because they paid
an unfairly low stumpage rate here. This is but one indicator
of how sympathetic the relationship is between the forest
industry and the Ministry of Forests.

It seems therefore, that in order to prompt our federal
government to action, that external pressure must be brought
to bear. I have contacted your organization in the hOpes that

”**.you might be able to help .publicize this issue. As I have no
gprevious experience in organizations or causes I do not have
"K‘spec1f1c suggeStions as to how to create the necessary public
". awareness.

If you judge the plight of the whales at Robson Bight to be
significant, I can certainly provide you with a wealth of
information. In exchange, I would certainly welcome your
sUggestions as to how to best bring this issue out into the
open, before all our old growth forest disappears.

Yours si cerely,

The National Shelter Adoption Program is a proven well designed sys-
tem of loving, caring, preparing and advertising the availability of
healthy loving pets to people who will return that love.

You probably ask yourself...."how come my local shelter isn't able to
save the number of lives they do at NSAL?"

Believe me - I am not criticizing others. It is a fact though, that
20 years ago talented, dedicated people came to NSAL and took the time
and the energy to test and establish procedures and policies that would
maximize successful adoptions. It took years to get to our level of ex-
pertise and'we aren‘t sitting back simply admiring our success.

We have designed comprehensive procedures to provide lovin care,

treatment and training to every animal that we rescue and

every family that wants to adopt.

From the actual physical shelter layout to the cute bows around the
pets, we try to think of every way to be the best life savers and match-
makers.

Since my early business experience was in opening new franchise type
stores around the country, it seemed like a natural extension of NSAL
love to offer our formula for success to communities all across the
country. Our goal is to multiply our success in your town and throughout
the entire country.

town, I'm looking for pet lover friends like you to help.
And I'nlproud to say that dream is becoming a reality. As you read
this letter, we have 23 local shelters under our wing of support.

Our support is not a simple few good words and an encouraging slap on
the back. He are helping in substantial ways with cash grants, on-site
seminars, advertising material and policy manuals to act as guides for
success. 925 staff works hang i2_hgg§ with 2225 local shelter.

The key is to train local volunteers to follow through on every phase
of the winning formula. And we are there to do that.

It costs a lot of money to operate such an aggressive program to save
lives all across the country. Our doors are open 365 days a year. Our
spaying services, hospital, medicine and adoption services are free to
anyone who adopts.

I'm especially proud of our services with disabled and handicapped

eoole who get so much from the unrestrained love that animals so wi l-
ingly share.

I hope you will immediately consider a contribution that will help

pay the enormous bills of our National Shelter Adoption Program in your
home town or across your area.

Asian Markets Foster Uncontrolled Poaching of Black Bears in the US ~

An unchecked demand and a willingness to
pay outrageous prices for bear parts in
several Asian countries, particularly
South Korea, has encouraged rampant
poaching and smuggling of black

bears in North America. The ille-

gal trade in bear gallbladders, be-

lieved to be aphrodisiacs as well

as cures for a variety of physical
ailments, has grown especially
lucrative.

In Utah, a recent six month
undercover investigation by the
Division of Wildlife Resources
(DWR) revealed that many of
the state's citizens with trade
connections to Korea, Japan or
China, have become involved
with illegal trafﬁcking in bear
parts.

“Many Koreans I approached
would readily buy the stuff and knew it
was illegal,” said investigator Sandy Shephard. “One
guy wanted as many gall bladders as I could supply. He said 1n
California he could get $50 each but m Korea they would sell for
$4000 or $5000.”

“Another Korean wanted a whole bear. Initially he wanted it
alive butI told him that was impossible so he said he would take a
dead one. He wanted to ship the whole animal to Korea where he
said he could sell it for $20,000.”

Recently the Wildlife Board of Utah
passed up an opportunity to reduce poach-
ing by improving the states' light regula-
tions on bear hunting. (See box)
Shephard explained that until a few
years ago, when the state decided to
limit the number of bear hunting
permits issued each year, more
poaching occurred in Utah than
in surrounding states. Now he
believes probably the same
amount of poaching occurs there
as in other areas.
Seven years ago, the National
Park Service, the US Fish and
Wildlife Service, and state and
local law enforcement agencies
began to set up cooperative under-
cover operations to catch the illegal
hunters and smugglers. Poaching
and/or trafﬁcking networks have been
unveiled in at least 17 states and two
> C an provinces. One particular investigation carried
out by federal and state wildlife agents from Tennessee, North
Carolina and Georgia, has resulted in over 30 convictions and ﬁnes
totalling well over $100,000. In another investigation, eighteen de-
fendants from Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland and Maine, were
arrested this February and are facing over 100 charges involving the
commercialization of bear parts as well as deer meat, fresh water
ﬁsh and an endangered plant.

conversation with Sandy Shephard of the
Utah Division of Wildlife Resources

-He went undercover for 6 months in an attempt to document the extent of poaching of
black bears in Utah to supply the Korean trade in bear parts.

-In many cases bears are killed and theirpaalts gall bladders and other parts eventually
wind up in the hands of Koreans. However, Mr. Shephard was unable to determine if
there was in fact a network of poachers, suppliers and middlemen dealing with Utah's
black bear.

-"Any Korean I approached would readily buy the stuff (bear parts) and knew that it
was illegal." But I'm not sure if they are poachers regularly supplying them.

-In some cases when a guides client kills a bear the guide will remove the animals gall
bladder because he knows what it's worth.

-"One guy (a Korean) wanted a whole bear. Initially he wanted a live bear but I told
him that was impossible so he said he would take a dead one. He wanted to ship the
whole animal to Korea. He told me in Korea he could sell the bear for $20,000."

-"Another Korean wanted as many gall bladders as I could get. He planned on sending
them to (middlemen in) California where they would then be shipped on to Korea. In
California he said he could get $50 each. In Korea they would eventually sell for
$4000.

In Utah, until recently, anyone could get a license to kill bears. "Before they came up
with the limited entry regulations there was probably more poaching of bears in Utah
than in the surrounding states. Currently it is probably about the same as other states."

-"We still need to work on our guide regulations." He was obviously very concerned
about guides involved with poaching.

-Bookc1iff is an area in Northeastern Utah with a large p0pulation of black bear. Also
the LaSalle mountains in the Southeastern part of the state. This is along the Colorado
border. He thinks maybe guides are crossing the border shooting bears and moving
their parts under another states tags.

-"There is nowaxto measure the damage the spring hunt has caused the black bear
population.",;§f0f t’li’e‘liounds men he said "I don't think this is much of a sport. These
guys just want a trophy. They want to say "I killed a black bear.'. Of course the dogs
also chase other wildlife. We are attempting to deal with the houndsmen but they are a
., large group in Utah."

:He is calling back with the name of two biologists from Arizona and Wyoming who
came up with the dynamics of black bear populations and who were responsible for
getting Utah to change its position on the hunting regs.

HE BEAR IS VEN-
erated in South
Korea. Elevated
over the centuries
to almost mythic
status, it is pro-
tected by law and
has been accorded
official status as
a national mon-
ument. Yet the
most recent gov—
ernment figures
show that the Asi-
atic black bear has
been hunted into
virtual extinction there. Scarcely more than 50
are believed to remain in isolated populations,
and the animal’s decline cannot be blamed on
the country’s turbulent political history. The
South Koreans, along with the Japanese and
the Chinese, use bear galls (as gallbladders
are known in the business) as an aphrodisiac
and a cure for everything from headaches
and indigestion to hemorrhoids, ulcers, and
cancer. It is a practice rooted in centuries—old
folk medicine. Wealthy South Korean busi-
nessmen will travel to Thailand and pay as
much as several hundred dollars for a single
serving of bear.

Christopher Servheen, a US. Fish and
Wildlife official based at the University of
Montana in Missoula and co—chairman of the
IUCN Bear Specialist Group, has traveled
around the world gathering data on bear
populations. He says that many South Kore-
ans believe that eating almost any-part of a
bear will imbue them with the power of the
animal. “The result is that, basically, they don’t
have any wild bears of their own.”

Accurate data on Asiatic black bear popu-
lations are extremely difficult to come by, and
Servheen’s estimates are bleak. He told the
1989 Convention of the International Asso-
ciation for Bear Research and Management,
which met in Victoria, British Columbia, that
the species, Ursus tbibetanus, is nearly extinct
in Afghanistan and Iran and has dwindled to
scattered populations in the mountains of
Pakistan and northern India. There is no solid
information from Burma, Laos, Vietnam, or
Kampuchea (Cambodia). In Thailand, hunt-
ing and habitat destruction have greatly re-
duced the bear’s range.

The black bear’s numbers are believed to
be stable in the eastern Soviet Union but de-
clining in China. Bear parts from China move
through Hong Kong and are difficult to trace.
Their probable destination is Japan, which is

just as large a consumer of bear gallbladders
as South Korea.

Because the numbers of U. tbibetanus are
dwindling over so much of its range, the spe-
cies is protected by CITES (the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Fauna and Flora).

In the first four months of 1988 alone, the

Japanese Ministry of International Trade and

Industry reported multi-million-dollar im-
ports of nearly 735 pounds of dried bear
galls—about 540 of which came from main-
land China, 44 from India, and 7 from Can-
ada; the rest entered via Hong Kong, with the
country of origin unknown. (A dried bear gall
weighs between 1.75 and 4 ounces.)

TRAFFIC, an affiliate of the Worldwide
Fund for Nature and monitor of the interna-
tional trade in wild plants and animals, main—
tains that Japan allows imports of what are al—
most surely bear organs mislabeled as coming
from species not covered by CITES. The 44
pounds from India, for example, were listed
as sloth bear galls. Exporting sloth bear parts
is illegal in India, but until the CITES meeting
last October, trade in them was not covered
under the treaty.

TRAFFIC officials reason that if Japan im-
ported 44 pounds from India in the first four
months of 1988—a figure that would indicate
the killing of about 200 bears—not all of the
galls could have come from sloth bears. Sloth
bear numbers worldwide are estimated at
5,000—10,000. TRAFFIC contends that poach-
ers must also be killing Asiatic black bears.

Atsushi Kawashima, who until recently
directed the import division of Japan’s Min-
istry of International Trade and Industry, ap—
plauds the inclusion of sloth bears on the
CITES list, saying that tightening controls on
the export of all bear parts from India will ease
enforcement problems in Japan. As matters
now stand, Japanese customs agents face the
almost impossible task of trying to determine
which bear species a shipment of galls actu-
ally comes from.

HRINKING ASIATIC BEAR POPULA-
tions, rising prices for bear parts, and an insa-
tiable demand for gallbladders have all com-
bined to put pressure on the North American
black bear, Ursus amen'canus, and have cre-

guides who can put them in touch with loosely
knit groups of poachers. These buyers are will-
ing to pay $50 to $125 for the teeth and claws
of a single bear and $250 or more for its gall-
bladder. In Seoul, the value of a gall can soar
to more than $5,000.

“It’s like a dope ring,” says Captain Ben
Wade of the North Carolina Wildlife Re-
sources Commission. “The bear parts go from
North Carolina to Detroit to San Francisco
to South Korea, where they’re worth 20 times
what they’re worth here. We’ll probably never
be able to close the trade down entirely.”

Six years ago, after hearing rumors about
increasingly bold poaching activities in North
American bear habitat, the National Park Serv-
ice, FWS, and state and local law enforcement
agencies began to set up cooperative under-
cover operations to catch illegal hunters.

IOperation Smoky, carried out by federal
and state wildlife agents from Tennessee,
North Carolina, and Georgia, has yielded

more than 30 convictions and
fines totaling well over
$100,000. These cases took
more than five years to de-
velop.
I Operation Berkshire was
started about four years ago
after the routine investigation
“é . of a southwestern Massachu-
setts restaurant that was serv-
ing illegally obtained deer

.Shenandoah National Park, in Virginia,
was the focal point of a third sting. In an
elaborate operation, wildlife agents set up a
bogus company called Abrams Creek Outfit-
ters, catering to would—be trophy hunters, af-
ter learning of illegal aerial bear hunts in
Alaska. From Alaska, the trail led to Virginia
and later to other states, including West Vir-
ginia, Montana, and Colorado. There have
been 23 arrests and fines of more than
$350,000, with cases tried in federal courts
where fines and sentences tend to be more se-

vere than in local courts.

I Operation Ursus, launched in 1986 in
California, concluded three years later with 75
arrests for activities involving one aspect or an-
other of the trade in bear parts. San Francisco
emerged as the primary shipping port for bear
galls headed for South Korea, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, and Singapore. This came as no sur—
prise: Wildlife agents already knew it was a
simple matter to buy dried bear galls across
the counter in the apothecary shops of San
F rancisco’s Chinatown.

Crimping the California trade was anything
but simple. “Poachers are often violent people
who care as little about human life as they do
about the life of a bear,” says Greg Laret, dep-
uty chief of California’s Department of Fish
and Game, Wildlife Protection Division. “Our
agents were out in the woods at night with
these guys and a lot of the time there was talk
about what they’d do if they discovered an
undercover agent.”

Convictions for bear poaching and traffick-
ing in bear parts can be costly for poachers,
particularly if they are charged under the La-
cey Act, a federal statute originally designed
to help states protect their resident wildlife
from interstate trade, and later, from interna-
tional commerce. Initially, the law set fines of
up to $20,000 and prison terms of five years.
According to US. FWS officials, the act was
amended recently to provide for the payment
of rewards for information leading to the ar-
rest and conviction of wildlife poachers. And
the Criminal Fine Improvement Act of 1987
raised fines possible under the Lacey Act to
$250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for cor-
porations.

Unfortunately, sentences in the bear poach—
ing cases have not reflected these increases. Dr.
Gwang Han, from Sylva, North Carolina, was
fined $20,000 for buying bear galls, 20 of
which were found drying in cheesecloth sacks
in his basement. Who Kim of Grand Rapids,
Michigan, accused of trafficking in bear galls, '
drew a six-month jail sentence and a $20,000
fine. Dennis H. Russell of Henderson, North
Carolina, was also fined $20,000 and sentenced
to three years. All three were arrested as part
of Operation Smoky.

In Operation Berkshire, where the cases
were heard in state courts, Christian Kim of
Fort Covington, New York, was fined $6,250
and spent 10 days in jail for trafficking. Roger
Ball of Housatonic, Massachusetts, received a
$2,650 fine and a six-month suspended sen-
tence for hunting in a wildlife sanctuary. And
Carl Eldridge, Jr., of Tuftonbo_ro, New
Hampshire, drew but a $1,650'fine on the

same charge.

All four major operations involved whole-
sale buyers, usually South Koreans. Law en-
forcement people characterize them as a close-
mouthed lot, with plenty of cash and an ex-
pertise in the business born of years of expe-
rience. Some poachers learn that the hard way
when they try to foist off pig gallbladders. It
is difficult to fool the South Korean buyers,
who use a simple taste test—licking the prod-
uct—to tell unerringly whether the gall comes

from a bear or some other animal.

IEUTENANT THOMAS KASPRZAK, A
regional supervisor for the law enforcement
division of the Massachusetts Department of
Fisheries, Wildlife, and Environmental Law
Enforcement and a leading figure in Opera-
tion Berkshire, describes professional black
bear poachers as “killers extraordinaire.
They’re cold and indifferent, driven by greed.
These are slick people who know how to
cover their tracks. This was only one ring we
were dealing with here, but how many rings
are there? Just a few of these people can have
a serious impact on a resource like bears.”

Operation Berkshire hauled in felons in-
volved in car thefts and insurance frauds. One
suspect is under investigation for possession
of fraudulent outfitters’ licenses. And a Ko-
rean Air Lines employee used his job to get
bear gallbladders out of the country. So many
cases are still in litigation that Kasprzak spends
more time in court than he does in the woods.

Kasprzak and his colleagues are caught in
a dilemma: The more poachers they arrest,
convict, fine, and occasionally jail, the greater
the demand for gallbladders becomes, the
higher the prices soar, and the greater the in-
centive to kill more bears. Justice, in effect, has
become a sort of double—edged sword.

“There’s too much money involved,” the
Massachusetts agent says. “There’s no ques-
tion that trafficking in illegal wildlife is going
to expand. We’ve had fines of $1,500 to $6,250,
but these people look at that as the cost of
doing business. It doesn’t mean anything to
them.”

Like other detectives in wildlife law en-
forcement, Kasprzak has his share of horror
stories about the activities of the poachers with
whom he and his undercover operatives
worked for almost three years. Most dramatic
are tape recordings and video tapes so grue-
some they are difficult to watch. In a clip

ﬁlmedincenualNewHampshirqthepoaeh-

ers are pumping arrows into a 25-pound bear
cub that is clinging in terror and‘baffled des-
peration to a tree, scuttling up and down the
trunk in a doomed effort to escape. When the
small bear was finally dislodged, the hunters
stabbed it repeatedly and then set their dogs
on the hapless animal. The sound track con-
tains a lot of whooping and strange giggling.
One of the hunters can be clearly heard to say,
as he dropped the dead cub next to its litter-
mate, “Let’s see which of these little devils is
bigger.”

Size makes no difference, nor does age, in
the gallbladder development of a bear. A full-
grown black bear may have a relatively small
gall; a tiny cub, a relatively large one. In any
case, South Korean buyers grade the organ
more on freshness, quality, and taste than size;
so cubs are fair game.

Kasprzak has read of poachers who, when
training their bear dogs, shoot a captive adult
bear in the paws, and “then they break its jaw
with a hammer so it can’t hurt the dogs.”

There is one piece of film the Massachu-
setts officer won’t watch any longer. “Bears
cry,” he says, as he slips a cassette into his
VCR. “Did you know that? Bears cry.”

The film shows a mother bear, still alive,
watching poachers dispatch one of her cubs
as it clings to a tree. On the sound track you
can hear her crying. It is an awful, desolate
sound.

“What we really need to deal with these
people is another level of penalties for the il-
legal commercial use of wildlife,” Kasprzak
asserts. “Poachers have got to be sent to jail
for extended periods of time, because what
we’re dealing with here is destruction of a re—
source that took years to build.”

N ADDITION TO THE LACEY ACT, THE
international trade in bear parts is covered by
a maze of local and state laws, some of which
accomplish very little. They lack uniformity
and vary so widely from state to state that they
often achieve effects opposite to those desired.
Virginia, for instance, has strict laws against
the sale of animal parts and meat. Neighbor—
ing West Virginia does not. The result is a
brisk interstate commerce. In some states the
sale of parts is a felony, in others there are no
laws at all.

In Greenville, Maine, Glen Perkins, a de-
tective for the Department of Inland Fisher-
ies and Wildlife, is awash in the paperwork
Still being generated by Operation Berkshire.

_ Like Kasprzak, Perkins contends that some
sort of cohesive legal approach to the bear
poaching problem is needed. Laws that vary
from one region to another within the same
state have not made it easy to deal with the
Korean Connection.

Portland and Bangor, Maine, both have siz-

able South Korean communities and the state

has acquired an unenviable reputation as a
clearinghouse for bear parts. “There’s a con-
siderable local market,” says Perkins ruefully,
explaining that not all the bear galls make their
way overseas. Some are bought and used right
in the state.

“We have a perceived problem,” says the
detective, “that because of the value of the gall
there’s a resulting detrimental effect on the
bears, which have very volatile population
sizes. But we have no records to prove that.
We don’t have carcasses lying around with the
galls removed.”

Perkins rates as slim the chances of revis-
ing Maine laws to require better record-keep—
ing so that it can be determined whether it’s
the price of the gall or an increase in hunting
that fuels the trade in bear parts. “You can
book a bear hunt for $800 to $1,200 a week,
and the gallbladder may be part of the price.
If you agree to turn over the galls of the bears
you take, an outfitter will drop his price. It’s
legal in Maine to sell the gall from a legally
killed bear or to give it as a gift. Sometimes
the outfitter or guide will take the gall with-
out the hunter’s knowledge, knowing there’s
a big market,” Perkins says. That might work
with out-of—state tourists, but it wouldn’t fool
a Mainer.

“We’re stonewalled,” he, says. “Too often
the attitude is, ‘The bear’s dead anyway. So as
long as he’s been shot legally, who cares what
happens to his gallbladder?’ But the bear is a
public resource, a public trust we’re not regu-
lating properly.”

In North Carolina, law enforcement offi-
cers actually filmed the purchase of galls from
bears killed in neighboring Tennessee. The
tape shows a South Korean buyer conducting
negotiations with a poacher while his elderly
mother grades a pile of bear galls. “The moun—
tain boys down here don’t like ’em [the South
Koreans], but they like their money,” says
Captain Ben Wade. “They’re real tight-
mouthed. They always say they’re self-em-
ployed and they all speak English very well.
But when we get ’em to court, they start jab-
bering away in Korean as though they don’t
understand what’s going on.”

North Carolina has made a concerted ef-
fort in recent years to conserve its bears, set-

ting up nine sanctuaries around the state. So
clandestine was the lengthy Operation Smoky
that bear researcher Roger Powell, who has
kept tabs on bears in Pisgah National Forest
for years, never even knew about it. Part of
his research at North Carolina State Univer-
sity involved radio-collating bears to check on
their movements and behavior inside the for-
est. One bear named Gladys was a regular, her
activities followed by Powell for 18 years.

Gladys was killed by a poacher with a .44
Magnum in 1987 as she slept in her hollow
tree with her two ,cubs, also
slain.The poacher had tracked
her through the signals emit—
ted by her radio collar and
had cut down the tree to get
at her. Wade says he can’t
prove it, but he believes the
man who killed Gladys was
among those arrested during
Operation Smoky for other
bear sanctuary violations.
Powell has since switched to
radio collars he can turn on
and off to prevent poachers
from finding the bears.

Wade adds that the inter-
national trade in his part of
the country is not confined to
South Koreans. “There’s a

too.”

Adam O’Hara, for years an undercover
agent in the FWS special operations unit, wor-
ries about the long—term impact of the inter-
national parts trade on the future of the
American black bear. During the Shenandoah
raids, he notes, “If the hunters found a black
bear, it was going to die, and when that bear
went down, somebody always had a plastic
bag and some string for the gall. There’s tre-
mendous pressure being put on the bear, be-
cause everyone has an outlet. That fact was
the most frightening to me. Faced with this
volume of indiscriminate killing, can the black
bear survive and be healthy?”

O’Hara describes one South Korean buyer
who ran a major East Coast operation: “He
traveled all over the United States, from Maine '
to Arkansas, paying anywhere from $35 to
more than $150 per gall, buying as many as
500 galls in one or two meetings. He made
two or three trips a year to South Korea. To
buyers like him, the gallbladder is just a prod-

.uct and they have no qualms
about a bear being killed to
get it. What these men have
created is a poacher’s credo——
‘Every bear that goes up a tree
is a dead bear.’”

To men like O’Hara, who
have spent years in deep
cover, it is discouraging to see
the results of an operation
such as Shenandoah: small
ﬁnes, suspended jail sentences,
and sometimes only house ar—
rests. “If a jurisdiction doesn’t

'usually handle many wildlife
cases and you walk in there
with a bear case, you’re lucky
to get in the door,” he says.

South Korean buyers gen-
erally make a bit of a show of
weighing the galls they buy,
says O’Hara. The ceremony
notwithstanding, the price is
usually based on appearance,

color, taste, and the consistency of the fluid

and the ﬂesh.

“A frozen gall reduces the price and many
South Koreans insist that the bear’s death be
recorded on film to establish the gall’s fresh—
ness and legitimacy,” he explains. “They’ll
show the poachers how to cut it out with a
piece of the liver attached, to ensure they’re
buying a bear gall and not one from a hog.”

and

OW BEST TO DEAL WITH THE
trade in bear parts has baffled even the mem—
bership of the International Association for
Bear Research and Management (IAB), which
weighed the question at its 1989 convention.
Bear biologists, as a rule, tread as warily as
the beasts they study. As one biologist ob-
served at that meeting, “The bear’s problems
with man began with Goldilocks and we’ve
been eating its porridge, breaking its furniture,
and sleeping in its bed ever since.”

Sterling Miller, of the Alaska Department
of Fish and Game in Anchorage, admits
“There is disagreement among professional
biologists as to the wisdom of creating a ban
on the sale of gallbladders. Some feel that if
there’s a legal source anywhere, traders can al-
ways claim legal origin. Others say that if you
force the trade underground with a‘ban, you
make the situation that much worse because

the price goes up.” Nevertheless, the council
of the IBA is considering and probably will
pass a resolution calling for a ban on the trade.

Other bear people, such as biologist Gary
Alt of the Pennsylvania Game Commission,
thinks the bear problem may be exaggerated.
A few years ago, Pennsylvania suspended bear
hunting for a season, and its population rose
to a record 7,500. “I just don’t see it as a big
problem here,” says Alt.

George J. Matula of Maine’s Department
of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife agrees. “We
don’t see any wholesale slaughter of bears, and
we’ve been monitoring their biology since
1981. We have an estimated population of
20,000 to 25,000 and in 1988 there were 2,652
legal kills. If poachers were getting that many,
you’d have a lot of bears unaccounted for,”
he says.

Population estimates,“ of course, are not
noted for precision. Bears do not stand around
waiting for the census taker, which is why fig-
ures for the total population of black bears in
the United States vary between a low of
140,000 and a high of 190,000 or more. There
are probably twice that many in Canada, but
no one really knows how many black bears
are wandering around the vast Northwest Ter—
ritories, for which there are no estimates at all.

Even in the US, California doesn’t have a
clue to how many bears it has. The legal kill is
estimated at 1,500 a year, and Greg Laret of
the Wildlife Protection Division of the De-
partment of Fish and Game figures an equal
number are probably slain by poachers.

“We often have a hard time convincing
urban judges about the seriousness of the
crime,” says Laret. “A hunter can make sev-
eral hundred dollars from one gall and he can
sell the teeth, claws, and hide . . . . One bear,
sold for its parts, can be worth $2,000 or more.
So a poacher isn’t particularly distressed when
he’s fined a few thousand dollars. He can make
that up in one or two nights. We need judges
who will give these guys hard jail time. That
would be a real deterrent.”

In Massachusetts, Tom Kasprzak makes the
same argument, calling for more consistent
statelaws on the illegal sale of parts of wild
animals. “This is a national problem,” he in-
sists. “We need to pool our intelligence and
our resources to infiltrate these groups. We
didn’t even know the extent of the problem
here until Operation Berkshire.”

Talks aimed at doing just that are under
way among law enforcement agencies in nine
eastern states, he says. But what bothers him

['18 S’tliat the necessary legal changes could take
years to enact, and in Massachusetts, the resi~
dent bear population—numbering only 750—
is extremely vulnerable.

Meanwhile, bear biologist Michael R. Pel-
ton urges the mandatory tagging of all slain
bears, which would make any untagged kill
an illegal one. Such a move might ease the

roblems of undermanned and overworked
wildlife departments. Some game wardens
now cover hundreds of square miles in often

bears, are largely nocturnal.

North Carolina’s Ben Wade says the solu-
tion lies in somehow marshaling public opin-
ion. “When people start taking an interest,
that’s when you’ll see some changes in the
laws. Sure, the state courts go easier on local
poachers. A bear isn’t as important to them as
a robber or a murderer,” he says. “It’s just a
bear. What we probably need is some kind of
international agreement like the one that pro-
tects polar bears, but politics being politics,

 

futile efforts to arrest poachers, who, like

that’s going to take years.” C]

 

No one really knows how
great an impact poaching for parts
is having on black bear popula-
tions in the United States. But as
bears disappear in other countries
and the demand for parts rises,
American black bear populations
are increasingly at risk.

Poachers are not particular
about how many animals they kill
or about the age or sex of their
prey. In 1980 who would have
imagined that within 10 years
hunters would slaughter more
than 875,000 African elephants to
satisfy the desire for objects made
of ivory? Might a similar fate
await the black bear? .

The population of the Ameri-
can black bear has already
declined substantially in the

1900s, mainly because Of habitat
destruction. Most states where
the Species occurs have laws that
regulate hunting. But poachers
may take as many or more bears
than legal hunters do. Here are
some suggestions about what you

few, maybe none, are genuinely cap-
tive-bred.

Does this illicit trade to South Korea
mean that japan’s home market for
bear gall bladder is going unsatisfied?
Far from it—thanks to another CITES-

usting operation originating in main-
land China. japan ratified CITES in
November 1980, China in April 1981.
Yet in the four years 1981-84, maybe as
many as 27,000 of China’s Asiatic black
bears were slain to supply thejapanese
gall-bladder market. It is impossible to
arrive at any precise figure because of
the lack of precision in both japanese
and Chinese customs’ data.

At the recent meeting of the parties to
CITES, China, in an attempt to justify
the continuance of this traffic, had inten-
ded to propose that the Asiatic black
bear be downlisted to Appendix II~
which does permit a limited trade
under striCt scientific controls.The pro-
posal was withdrawn. The animal re-
mains on Appendix I and may not be
internationally traded.

NOTE: In April, following appeals from inter—
national conservationists, Japan passed a new
which brings the country ’s import regulations in line
with CITES. So Japanese imports thppendix 1
species should now be a thing of the past. For the
signs are that, on the issue of wildlife trade, Japan
wishes to be seen as a model of rectitude.

Last August in Utah, the state's five—member Wildlife Board issued a highly
controversial two-year decree permitting bear hunting for ﬁve and a half of the seven
months bears generally spend out of hibernation. Board members approved the
proclamation by a 3 - 2 vote following a heated public hearing. It was the fourth
hearing held on bear hunting since July, culminating almost nine hours of debate
among conservationists, animal rights advocates, hunters, guides, trappers, wool
growers, cattle ranchers and members of the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.
,~"'”There was once a time when hardly 40 people would show up for the public
_,»’hearings over Utah's black bear hunting regulations; and those that did come were
mostly members of the various hounding clubs who spent a good part of the day
arguing about who owned the better trackers. A few years ago, people who were more
likely to take aim with a camera than a loaded gun started to pack the chairs at public
hearings to make their points about conservation. But money, and consequently
support of the varied wildlife programs still lies on the side of the hunter.

The new regulations divide the hunting season into several periods involving
.. different methods of hunting. During a seven week period 1n the spring, hunters and
hounds, or hunters with archery tackle and bait, are allowed to kill the bears.
Concurrently their exists a 14 week penod for' 'pursuit- only" hunts 1n which bears are
chased by dogs and no weapons are allowed. A similar hunt exists in the fall except
dogs are not allowed. An "any-method" late fall hunt ﬁnishes the season.

These regulations are quite disconcerting when one considers the growing number
of bears killed each year - from 26 in 1980 to 97 in 1989. As there exists no accurate
estimate of population size, effects of the hunt on the species are ambiguous. There can
be anywhere from 600 to 150 black bears in Utah. According to data from the
Division of Wildlife Resourcesaless than 10 percent of these bears reach even the age
of ten, compared to a general life expectancy of 25 years.

Historically, the black bear has earned its bad reputation (bears were considered
varmits in Utah until 1967 and it was legal to take any number of the animals until
1976) from doing what it does best — eating. While preferring a vegetarian diet, they
rarely turn down a chance for an easy meal of sizzling bacon or a beehive dripping with
honey. During late summer, a bear may gain up to 30 pounds a week in a ﬁnal binge
before bedding down for its long winter nap.

"Their appetites have no end," says Dr. Hal Black, mammalogist at. Brigham Young
University. "But they have to be that way. They come out of their dens in April, and
spend the next seven months getting ready to go back in for another five months."

Once the bear retires to its winter chambers, it does not eat, drink, urinate or
defecate during the time spent in the den. Body temperature and oxygen consumption
drop, and an average of 4000 calories are needed daily until the animal emerges in early
spring. Females give birth during their time in the den, suckling and sheltering the
litters as they "sleep."

It's no wonder bears appear rather groggy and gaunt when ﬁrst setting paw outside
their cozy chambers in early spring. "They are lethargic, eager to find food and the
worst part of it is the limited amount of food available for them to eat, " said Dr. Black.
"In consequence, they lose weight until summer when eating becomes their

preoccupation, " It 1s the spring ﬁght for survival and the bears ‘lethargic condition that

makes baiting deplorable and hounding a cruel pursuit.

"Baiting 1s killing an animal when its head IS down," comments Margaret Pettis of
the Utah Wllderness Association. "The bear IS hungry, he smells the food, and while it
is eating someone shoots 10in the back with an arrow. Secondly, it causes the problem
of drawing bears to human food and garbage."

Protests like these were successful in bringing the issue back for a second vote
before the Wildlife Board in October. However, the result was the same 3 -2 decision
in favor of the hunters. In 1992 the regulation will be up for another vote perhaps by
then the bears will be given some consideration.

which stretched from Alaska, through Idaho, Utah,
California and to Nebraska.

Continuedfrom A1

The three Utah indictments were
handed up by a grand jury, while
seven search warrants and two car
searches were carried out on Thurs-
day and Friday, Benson said.

David Paul Butts, 29, Ogden; Mi-
chael Tracy Jacobsen, 23, Spring-
ville; and Troy W. Garner, 20, High-
land, made their first appearances
Fh‘day afternoon before US. Magis-
. trate Ronald Boyce. Assistant US.
Attorney Mark ‘Vincent said the men
were taxidermists.

. Butts ‘ was charged with nine
counts of violating wildlife laws, in-
cluding selling migratory birds, a

black bear, a pronghorn antelope.

and a sandhill crane.

If convicted, he could face a maxi-
mum of 27 years in prison.

In another indictment, Jacobsen
was charged with three coutl‘ts of
selling migratory birds, while Cairner

faces one count of bartering migra-
tory birds and another of being an
accomplice to an illegal sale. .

Butts and J acobsen were released
on $10,000 signature bonds and
scheduled for arraignment Monday,
while Garner was detained to a com-
munity treatment center. Vincent
said Garner received phone calls
while the search warrant was being
served, and his release might endan-

_ ger the safety of undercover officers.

Because black market poaching
has become so lucrative, officials are
seeing connections between illegal
game sales and drugs. “Wildlife is
becoming very similar to drug activi-
ty,” said Neill 8. HM, supervi-
sory special agent of the US. Fish
and Wildlife Services.

Hartman said there is no legal
market for sales of wild birds and
waterfowl. He hopes Friday’s arrests
will send a message to those who
hunt illegally and, by violating pro-
tective laws, threaten to destroy the
natural diversity of the environment.
“I believe we have to make astrong
stand.”

Poachlng Probe
Bags Bi

By Dawn House
Tribune Staff Writer

A laborer at a Vernal sanill‘
and two teens have been charged
with killing and wasting protected

wildlife' 1n what officials are callin
the largest case of Joy killing 1n the
state’s history.

Since February, purported joy
killers, police officers, taxider-
mists and hunters have been named
in four major poaching cases in-
volving charges of killing migra-
tory birds, bears, antelope, rams,
trophy mule deer, wild horses and
eagles.

Thursday, Lance Gardner, 123, -'

Vernal, was charged in a 23- cOunt
misdemeanor complaint with kill-
ing and wasting protected wildlife
and domestic animals in Uintah
County.

Two Vernal boys, aged 16 and
17, were charged? 1n Uintah County
Juvenile Court last week with 33
wildlife violations.

Uintah County Attorney Harry
Souvall said the three defendants
are involved in the alleged killing
and wasting of Rocky Mountain
bighorn rams, antelope, deer, elk,
eagles and wild horses.

Charges are expected to be filed.

against the defendants in neighbor-
ing Daggett County and in Moffat
County, Colo. Federal charges are
pending.

The investigation began last 0c.-

tober with a tip to DWR conserva?

tion officer Jason Teeguarden on a
poaching ring that had been oper-
ating for the past seven years. Offi-

cials say investigators and wildlife

detector dogs have uncovered only
a fraction of slaughtered big game. ,

The defendants face forfeiture
of vehicles and guns used in the
wildlife killings and lifetime revo-
cation of hunting privileges.

On Monday in a separate case,
three taxidermists pleaded inno-
cent in federal court-to charges of
illegally killing and selling protect-
ed wildlife.

Those charges came in the wake
of a sting operation dubbed Opera-
tion Wasatch involving state and
federal undercover officers in
Utah, Alaska, Nebraska, Idaho and
California. Officials say up to 100
individuals could faée charges.

US Attorney for Utah Dee Ben-
son said the sting operation target-
ed numerous individuals who were
illegally killing game for commer-
cial resale. “The wildlife was mar-
keted for interior decorating pur-
poses in both wholesale and retail
markets ” he said.

Wildlife Cases Spawn Rash of Calls, Leads

Continued From 3.1.

and public relations jobs. It wasn’t
uncommon for an officer to be called
off a case to help with a moose trans.
plant or fish planting project.

Now. due to a redefining of roles
within the agency, conservation offi-
cers are required to spend 80 per-
cent of their working hours on law
enforcement.

' “We can follow up more leads and
tips." said .Mr. Miya. “Nothing’s
more frustrating to the public than
to call our poaching line [1-800-662-
DEER] with a tip and see nothing
happen. Now, we’re better able to re-
spond." '

The case against the three taxider-,

mists made by both federal and state

agencies also raised public aware»

ness about the complicated laws

- which‘ govern the commercial use of ,

wildlife. , ' V ‘ .

'“Leg'ally youjcan both stuff or.

mount any animal, but it is not all
right to sell the mounts.” 'said Mr.
Miya. “I can't go out and kill a' bird
legally and then sell it. Wildlife law
is differentbecause'both the state
and federal government still retain
Some legal interest after an animal.
bird or fish is killed. If the animal is
taken legally, you gain possession.
But the state and federal govern-
ment can still claim interest and tell
you how it can be used.”

These lawslcame about. largely be-
cause market hunters brought many
species to the brink of extinction in
the early 19008 by using wildlife for

.. commercial purposes.

Now, instead of killing protected

-. Wildlife for meat. the demand for il-

legal stuffed birds. fish and animals
comes from private collectors and

.'decorators who decorate their

homes and offices with wildlife
mounts.

. While most wildlife cannot be used
fOr commercial purposes. there are
exceptions. Trappers can sell the
hides. of some fur-bearing animals
for profit. Some parts of big game
like antlers, hides and heads can be

. sold legally.

And. while violatingjthe Lacey Act
or Federal Migratory" Bird Treaty
Act can result in prison terms up to
two years and fines up to $250,000.
most state wildlife violations fall in
the misdemeanor category.

Mr. Miya would like to see viola-
tions for joy killing or wanton com-
mercialization increased to felony
charges. He also said, western states
are now working closely on recipro-
cal license revocations. This would
mean that poachers who had their

license revoked in one state couldn't
legally hunt in another state.

The DWR officer'said that, as a
result of the case being made against
the three taxidermists, many sports-
men who unwittingly violated game
laws by selling or buying stuffed
birds in the past are calling to ask
what they should do if they unknow-

ingly violated the law.
He advises such people to contact
either the DWR office closest to

-them or the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

Service in Salt Lake.

“We won’t say we won't file
charges. but the courts generally
look more leniently on those who did
turn themselves in." he said. -

 

MOUNTAIN HOME, Idaho
(AP) -‘- .Two hunters who took aim
at a roadside decoy deer had ille-
gal hunting charges dismissed be-
cause a judge ruled the “deer"
they shot at wasn’t a live animal
. And that may ut a crimp in the
Idaho Fish 'an {Game .Depart-
ment’s‘ use 'of decoys ‘to catch

‘ hunters .who illegally use spot-
lights to shoot wildlife at night. of-
ficials said.

On Tuesday, Elmore County
Magistrate John Sellman dis-
missed misdemeanor charges
against brothers Jerry Cooper of
Boise and Todd Cooper of Merid-
ian, saying the pair could not be
convicted of “hunting with the aid
of artificial light" if they were
shooting at a fake deer.

Fish and Game enforcement
chief Frank NeSmith said the Coo-
pers’ acquittal on a legal techni-
cality wasthe first time an Idaho
judge had ruled that fake deer do
not constitute “wildlife."

Fish and Game enforcement of-
ficers have been using what they
call “artificial simulated animals"
to bust spotlighting hunters for
four years. NeSmith said.

“Most judges have decided that

 

Hunters Who Shot 'Deer’
Have Charges Dropped

they [decoy deer] are so realistic
that the hunter was actually shoot~
ing at a real deer," he said. “We'll
wait and see if a trend starts, and
if so. this could be a question to
deal with in legislation to close the
loo hole in the law."

he Coopers‘ attorney. Phillip
Gordon of Boise, said c arges of
shooting from a public road are
still pending against the men, who
he said plan to contest the misde-
meanor offenses in a jury trial.

Idaho law says a person cannot
hunt any “animal or bird" by the
aid of “artificial light of any
kind."

Gordon said the state’s defini-
tion of “wildlife" was the key fac-
tor that won the acquittal.

“We contend a decoy deer is not
an animal or bird because a decoy
deer is not alive," he said.

NeSmith said it would be unfor-
tunate for Fish and Game to lose
the decoy deer as a tool for catch.
in poachers who hunt with the
ai of light after dark.

He said that without a decoy,
catching people who spotlight
deer is difficult. Almost every
Western state uses decoy deer to
snare spotlighting poachers, he
sat .

CRUELTY TO ANIMALS INCREASES IN BRITAIN

In a statement to the House of Lords, March 12, 1991, Lord
Morris said:

"The RSPCA reports that between 1989 and 1990 convictions
increased by 28 percent, including those for malicious cruelty to
dogs through sadistic offences like baiting, beating and
shooting, which rose by 61 percent. Cruelty to horses and
donkeys trebled, and there was a 60 percent increase in abuse of
farm animals."

He continued by stressing the need for "mandatory
disqualification from keeping an animal upon conviction for
cruelty.

"At the moment, bans are imposed at the discretion of
magistrates. The RSPCA spokesman recently said that they must
ensure that unfit owners are not allowed to cause further
suffering . . .

"As Richard Davis, head of the RSPCA’s inspectorate, put it:
'It is deeply frustrating when convicted cruelty offenders are
not deprived of the opportunity to ill treat more victims.’ The
Bill is shatteringly silent on the whole subject, and it is a

silence to be deplored."

131 Criminal Justice Bill

[LORD MORRIS or CASTLE MORRIS]
on the question of cruelty to animals there is a
deafening silence. We may search the Bill in vain for
any proposals to deal with a crime about which the
British people feel most passionately, as my postbag

regularly tells me—a crime which is increasing _t___o_ﬂ

alarming proportions The RSPCA reports that
between 1989 and 1990 convictions increased by 28
per cent. including those for malicious cruelty to dogs

through sadistic offences like baiting, beating and ‘

shooting. which rose by 61 per cent. Cruelty to horses
and donkeys trebled, and there was a 60 per cent.
in abuse of farm animals. Yet the

sufﬁciently urgent or serious to require inclusion or
rectiﬁcation in the Bill. However many people have
informed me that they will be calling for an
amendment to provide for,fﬁandatory disqualiﬁcation
from keeping an animal upon conviction for cruelty.

At the moment, bans are imposed at the discretion

of magistrates. The RSPCA spokesman recently said j

that they must ensure that unﬁt owners are, not

allowed to cause further suffering.‘I am well aware
‘ thaimthat" is a complicated proposal: how does one

monitor such a ban? Does it not bear unequally upon
some. like farmers, whose living depends upon

animals? But those problems must be solved. in the V

name of compassion and justice. As Richard Davies.
head of the RSPCA’s inSpectorate put it:

"It is deeply frustrating when convicted cruelty offenders
are not deprived of the opportunity to ill treat more victims".

The Bill 15 shatteringly silent on the whole subject, and

it is a silence to be deplored , -... W

One cannot say, however, that the Bill is silent on
the matter of racial equality and discrimination. In its
origins it spoke with a halting and uncertain voice.
but. to their credit, on Report in another place, the
Government introduced a clause on racial discrimina-
tion. Clause 79(1) now includes paragraph (b), which
adds that:

“the Secretary of State shall in each year publish such
information as he considers expedient for the purpose of
facilitating the avoidance by such persons of discrimination
against any persons on the ground of race or sex or any other
improper ground".

But is that clause now sufﬁcient? As Evelyn Waugh
put it,

“up to a point, Lord Copper",

or, like the curate’s egg, it is good so far as it goes. But
there are arguments for further amendment, as my
noble friend Lord Richard powerfully proclaimed.

The Minister may care to ask himself three
questions in relation to Clause 79(1) as it now stands:
who monitors, and how, those key decisions in the
criminal justice system so that the Secretary of State is
enabled to publish relevant information? Secondly,

ill it, or will it not, be a duty for the criminal justice
agencies to take remedial action if the published
information suggests that discrimination has taken
place? Thirdly, if discrimination on racial grounds
were alleged, what recourse would be open to the
individual? Surely, we need more and stronger
safeguards than the Bill presently provides if we are to

66 L089 34 Job 5-12

Criminal Justice Bill 132

ensure that in the processes of criminal justice people
are treated in a manner that is without racial
discrimination. We on this side of the House shall at
a later stage be bringing forward an amendment to
that effect.

On cruelty to animals, the Bill is silent; on racial
discrimination. it is uncertain: on children and
children's evidence it is insuﬂicient. In June 1988 the
Home Ofﬁce set up the Advisory Group on
Video-Recorded Evidence under Judge Pigot, and the
Pigot Report was published in December 1989. The
group took time to consider the matter with great
care. The Govemment have had more than a year to
consider the report. It was immediately warmly
welcomed by legal practitioners. social workers and
psychiatrists who work with children involved in
criminal proceedings.

We must be careful to ensure a just balance in those
cases and we must be vigilant to maintain the full
rights of defendants at every stage. but it is widely felt
among many organisations concerned with the
welfare of children, including the Children's Legal
Centre, the NSPCC, the National Children’s Bureau
and Childline. that the Bill does not go far enough in
implementing Judge Pigot‘s recommendations. For

.example, the Pigot Report recommended that child
' witnesses:

“ought never to be required to appear in public as witnesses

in the Crown Court".

That is not a casual proposal. It was made in the

- full knowledge of the difﬁculties that it would create

—like the practical problem of ensuring that the same
judge presided over all aspects of a trial, and the
possibility that the practice would lead to a large
number of recalls. Nevertheless. it is a clear and
unambiguous recommendation. The Bill, as we have
it, would make a video recording of the testimony of
a child witness admissible, but only on condition that
the child was available for cross-examination at the
trial if required. It is left entirely to the judge’s
discretion whether such cross—examination should
take place in open court or by means of a television
link. That means of course that it is impossible to
inform a child witness before the trial about the way
in which evidence is to be given. The child’s fears
cannot be allayed; the stress may well be considerable;
and in some cases the child, and the trial, will break
down.

There are other insufﬁciencies, especially perhaps in
the area of preliminary hearings, but enough has been
said to show that there is still a great deal to do if the
Bill is to improve signiﬁcantly the administration of
justice in cases involving children.

The Bill is silent on cruelty to animals; it is
uncertain on racial equality; and it is insuﬁcient on
the protection of children. There are errors both of
omission and commission. The Bill has:

“left undone thintis which it ought to have done, and done
.. things which it 01‘ am not to have done”.

But we on this Sid} of the House will try to exercise the
divine prerogative of mercy on it, and so strive to

"They are cutting indiscriminately because they don't care for the future. One year of
their cutting is equal to ten years of ours, and they don't replant the teak as'we did."-
Saw Ba Thin, a Karen leader, on the Thai logging companies’ teak harvest in Burma.

W # 2/90 Burmese Teak Forest

QWM is calling for letters

protesting the destruction of the world's last great
teak forest.

80% of the world's remaining teak is found
along a band of forests just inside Burma's 900
mile border with Thailand. After Thailand's
moratorium on domestic logging two years ago,
Thai ﬁrms eagerly negotiated the purchase of
4,000,000 acres of teak harvesting concessions in
Burma. The result has been an orgy of clear-cutting
and forest despoliation. Within the year Thai
companies will have clear-cut a 50-mile wide band
within the Burmese border. If the current rate of
logging continues unchecked the entire teak forest
could disappear this decade. A habitat for
indigenous peoples and an ecosystem of rare and
exotic species is being destroyed.

28 years of military rule has turned Burma,
once Southeast Asia's wealthiest country, into one
of the world's poorest and most repressive. To
raise capital, the Burmese government is selling its
teak resources to foreign companies at undervalued
prices. Diplomatic sources and foreign observers
agree that money raised from these sales is used to
purchase weapons to keep the military in power.

In September 1988, in a bloodbath far
exceeding the June 1989 Beijing carnage, thou-
sands of peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators
were slaughtered by government forces in
Rangoon. Since then tens of thousands of Burmese
citizens have been arrested, tortured, and executed.

The Burmese military has also been waging
a genocidal war against ethnic minorities along the
Thai border for decades. Government atrocities
and deforestation have forced nearly thirty thou-
sand of the Karen and Karenni people to seek
asylum in Thailand. For generations their self-
sustaining cultivation of teak had guaranteed” the
future of the forest. Burmese military and Thai
companies have now joined forces in driving them
from their lands.

In May of 1990, free elections gave the
National League for Democracy (NLD) 392 of 458
seats in the Burmese national assembly. The NLD
pledged during the campaign to return remaining
forest lands to ethnic minorities. However, the
military is placing increasingly unacceptable
conditions on the transfer of power. N LD
Secretary-General Aung San Suu Kyi remains
under house arrest and 63-year old NLD Chairman
Tin U has been sentenced to 3-years at hard labor.

{}All Targeted Officials
-Express concern about the ecological and human

October 24, 1990

rights abuses caused by the logging of teak on the
Burmese-Thai border; '
-Stress that the world community is calling for the
immediate transfer of power to the democratically
elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi’s
National League for Democracy and urge that they
do likewise;

-(Not to Chit Swe!) Emphasize that any govern-
ment or company that conducts business with the
Burmese junta is bankrolling a brutal dictatorship
and giving tacit endorsement and encouragement to
their environmental and human rights abuses.

{}MR. Subin Pinkayan/Thai Foreign Minister
-Cite Burma’s abhorrent human rights record and
remind him that Burma’s teak revenues purchase
arms used to brutally suppress the Burmese people;
-Request that the Thai government reevaluate its
economic ties with the Burmese military regime; in
particular ask him to end Thai lumber companies’
exploitative logging in Burma;

-Recommend that Thailand impose a moratorium
on the forced repatriation of Burmese asylum
seekers ﬂeeing persecution;

-Encourage the Thai Foreign Minister to use his
ofﬁce to assume a leadership role in negotiating a
peaceful settlement of the conflict in Burma.

{}Wayne Calloway/ CEO PepsiCo, Inc.

(Pepsi has signed a joint venture to produce and
distribute its product in Burma," despite pleas by
dissidents and human rights groups not to invest
there after the brutal military crackdown.)

-Stress that money invested in Burma is funding
the junta's genocidal war against the insurgents and
contributing to the destruction of the teak forest;
-Remind him of the military’s brutal response to the
August 1988 democracy movement and that if
Pepsi truly "..shares your humanitarian concerns"
as spokesperson Barry Holt has indicated, it must
discontinue all investment in Burma until the
democratically elected government is installed and
human rights and environmental abuses stop;
-Indicate your support for the Burmese dissident
and exile communities’world-wide publicity
campaign against Pepsi and boycott of its products.

{}Lt. Gen. Chit Swe/Burmese Forest Minister
-Stress that if the Thai logging companies are al-
lowed to continue their pillaging of the teak forests
this valuable natural resource will be forever lost to
the people of Myanmar (see note on back);

-Urge him to place an immediate moratorium on
the logging operations of all Thai companies along
the Myanmar-Thai border until environmentally
sound teak harvesting practices can be imple-
mented and guaranteed.

THE COMPANY or DOGS

Edited by Michael].Rosen

21 STORIES BY
CONTEMPORARY MASTERS

f all the beasts of the kingdom,

we cherish the dog as loyal com-

panion. Past literature, however,

has portrayed the noble canine

with patronizing sentimentality
— as Diligent Worker, Loyal Hero, or
Silent Sidekick.

Now The Company of Dogs explores the
valued companionship we share with
dogs. Filled with humor, compassion,
and wry understanding, these stories
reveal an important truth: our dogs know
us better than we know ourselves.

 

Well-known artists
and writers ioin
forces to celebrate
man's best friend in
this truly unique
collection of photo-
graphs, stories and
drawings.

The Company of Dogs brings together re-
nowned writers such as Ann Beattie, Amy
Hempel, David Leavitt,
McGuane to celebrate the dog. In the

and Thomas

spirit of the collection, noted photogra-
pher William Wegman and New Yorker
cartoonist Charles Barsotti have contrib—
uted their unique art, and editor Michael
J. Rosen has provided an overview. What’s
more, The Company of Dogs helps our
canine companions directly: proﬁts are
earmarked for dog welfare agencies.

Profits from The Company of Dogs will be
donated to agencies providing direct care
for animals in distress. The artists repre-
sented in the collection have donated
their singular talents, demonstrating that
a considerable amount of concrete good
can be done by people who are willing to
stand together. We are so rarely able to
contribute personally that it is a particu-
lar honor to have had the chance to
organize this book in which a company of
notable artists has contributed not only to
dogs but to people who care about dogs.

On behalf of each dog that ‘ “

has enriched these stories

and each dog that will
benefit from them, I ex-
press my deep gratitude.

Funding Guidelines for Organizations Providing
Direct Care and Intervention Services for Dogs

 

As part of the design of The Company of Dogs, the
profits generated by its sale are to be granted to
nonprofit organizations who are engaged in provid-
ing ongoing and emergency care for dogs in neigh-
borhoods throughout the United States. Admitted-
ly, this is a very small arm of the invaluable
services that humans offer the other animals in
our stewardship. However it follows from the
book's subject matter-~companionship with
dogs--and from the book's limited revenues, that
such targetted funding will help both in decision
making and in long-range publicity that the grants
can provide. While the funds from this book are
to be directed toward this singular and most
common human charge, it is our hope that funded
projects will generate larger compassions and
broader concerns that embody all creatures in need
of our collective attention and charity.

Grant monies will be available beginning August 1,
1991. Application materials must simply include a
1990 annual report or equivalent and a request
letter specifying a particular amount of money and
how it will be used to enhance, extend or develop
existing operations. Since the funds are likely
to be a one-time allotment, they cannot be used to
start new projects unless subsequent funding and
requisite staffing are assured. Nor can the funds
be used for purchasing office equipment, building
renovation, general office supplies, or other
organizational expenses that do not directly fund
the services provided to their clients or dogs.
Understandably, there are many crucial aspects of
an organization's well-being that have an indirect
impact on a program's success; yet funds from this
somewhat unusual and creative source need to be
channeled to dogs in critical situations. Since
the funds are coming primarily through the book's
royalties, the authors' donated permission fees,
and contributions from the publisher, there is an
overly simplified, but earnest equation behind
each purchase: buy this book, help this dog.

Grants might include, but are by no means limited
to, programs that provide: adoption or humane
treatment education, temporary shelter for strays
or lost animals, rescue and emergency

services, low-cost spaying/neutering or

other veterinary services, aid for the

Volume 7, Number 7

December 1989/January 1990

 

 

By Carol Moulton

Part I

The neutering of puppies and kittens between
six weeks and six months of age has reportedly
been done by a small number of animal
shelters for at least ten years. Two years ago,
an article in the Journal of the American
Veterinary Medical Association by Dr. Leo
Leiberman, (Leiberman, L.L. JAVMA 191, (5),
1987: pp. 518—519) created renewed interest in
the procedure, which is now being widely
discussed as a potential, though problematic,
solution to one part of the pet overpopulation
problem.

Although the majority of animal care and con—
trol facilities have a mandatory spay/neuter
policy, compliance with the policy ranges from
poor to pretty good. The best compliance rates
are from 85% to 90%, and this only happens
with careful pre—adoption screening, a strong
spay/neuter contract, and follow—up activity
ranging from gentle reminders to legal action.
More typical compliance rates are from 50% to
60%.

For all our efforts, we are still adopting out
enough potential breeders to repopulate our
shelters and even to increase the pet popula-
tion in a community. That is very unacceptable
to anyone who cares for animals and knows
firsthand the tragedy of mass euthanasia.

Early spay/neuter has the potential to boost
spay/neuter compliance rates close to 100% for
every shelter. While far from a panacea for the
complex and multi-faceted problem of pet

overpopulation it could eliminate reproduction
and free the shelter’s human and financial
resources from spay/neuter follow—up to educa—
tion, cruelty investigation, behavior and obe—
dience counseling, and other productive
activities.

American Humane is aware of almost a dozen
shelters currently performing early
spay/neuter. Some are evaluating the pro—
cedure on a few selected animals and some are
neutering animals less than four months of

Humane Society And Veterinary Group
Honored For Neuter/Spay Program

The Texas Veterinary Medical Association and
Texas A&M University’s College of Veterinary
Medicine recently honored the Humane
Society of Austin & Travis County and the
Capital Area Veterinary Medical Association
for their cooperative neuter/spay program. It’s
considered one of the few joint efforts in the
nation between a humane society, a local
veterinary medical association and a college of
veterinary medicine.

Since the program was established 17 years
ago, thousands of Central '1bxas animals have
been altered and some 2,300 veterinary
medical students, more than one-third of
veterinarians practicing in Texas today, have
been involved.

Currently, the Humane Society handles close
to 40,000 animals annually. Once a week, for
11 months of the year, senior veterinary
medical students from ’lbxas A&M travel more
than 200 miles to and from the Humane
Society to spay and neuter adopted animals.

Approximately 80% of the students participate

in the program as part of their surgical train-
ing. They have completed preparatory courses
in surgical procedures and patient care, and
perform the surgery under the close supervi-
sion of a senior faculty member of the college.

Veterinarians in Austin and at Texas A&M
credit two Humane Society leaders with much
of the program’s success. John Davenport
helped establish the program and continued to
be a key supporter during his 36 year tenure as
president of the Humane Society. Veterinarians
say that it would have been difficult to main-
tain the program if not for the professional
shelter operations run by Marjorie Bird, who
served as director of shelter operations from
1964 until her retirement earlier this year.
Each received a special award for their efforts.

The members of the Capital Area Veterinary
Medical Association were honored for pro—
viding and maintaining the necessary equip—
ment for the cooperative program. They were
also recognized for donating veterinary
medical services for the animals at the
Humane Society.

Humane Educator’s Workshop Planned

Ways to utilize school district curriculum,
appropriate humane education activities for
students from pre—school to grade 12 and basic
learning theory will be discussed at The
American Humane Association’s first Humane
Educator’s Training Workshop. The workshop,
which is limited to 30 participants, will be held
in Denver, Colorado, March 16-18, 1990. Also
on the program are education philosophy and
goals, methods to adapt materials to certain
grade levels, problem solving for educational
and administrative issues, strategies for han—

One, going on two. Is that too old to be adopted? For a lot of dogs, it is. Many of
the dogs in our shelter are between six and 24 months old.

When they were puppies, someone wanted them and took them home. Then they
grew up, spending most of their time in the backyard. The people who thought
they were such cute puppies didn’t like them very much when they grew big.

No one ever took the time to teach them to sit, stay, stop barking or any of the
other rules that make good dogs such good company. But these dogs are good
dogs; they just have bad manners.

Each one is a miracle waiting to happen, a diamond in the rough. They are smart,
and they love people. They are young enough to learn quickly, and old enough
to pay attention to their lessons. They only need three things: Attention, Affec-
tion and Training. With these, they will soon become super dogs, the kind your
friends wish they could own. And they can, if they look for a dog that’s one,

The Board And Long Range Planning

Part 3

After the long range plan is prepared and
approved by the Board, the work has just
begun. As with the earlier stages of preparing
for the development of the plan, the Board
must take the lead. This involves securing and
allocating sufficient human and financial
resources, and providing for the ongoing
monitoring of the plan.

How does a Board organize for monitoring the
long range plan? There are many ways. Some
Boards have established a Flaming Committee
while others have requested regular reports to
the entire Board by the Executive Director.
Regardless of the method, it is important that
the procedures established are not overly
cumbersome and that they provide required
information but not unnecessary details. I have
developed a system based on the old theory of
Management By Exception which many
boards use. The system requires reports to the
Board only when there is a “significant
variance” in one of two areas:

0 Time frame — when the time for completion
of the action step falls beyond or is projected
to fall beyond the target date by a predeter—
mined number of days, weeks, or months,
and

0 Budget — when the cost for completion of
an action step is greater or projected to be
greater than estimated by a predetermined
amount.

In each case the Board decides what the
“significant variance”,(the time or amount
required to mandate a report) should be. In
this model, it is important that the Executive
Director has the responsibility for monitoring
the plan and reporting to the Board. In subse-
quent articles we will explore more fully the
respective roles and responsibilities of the
Board and the Executive Director.

In addition, the Board is responsible for
annually reviewing and updating the plan. In
most organizations this is a one day meeting
involving the same group originally involved in
preparation of the plan — the Board, the
Executive Director, and the staff. What are the
steps in the annual review of the plan?

0 Review of the mission, is it still relevant?
0 Review of current resources, both human

by Dennen Reilley

and financial.
0 Accomplishments/successes of the past year
0 What was not completed/accomplished?
0 Review of continuing responsibilities.
0 What must be done in the upcoming year?
0 How can we get it done?
0 What important tasks can’t we get to?
0 Who’s responsible for what?
0 Prepare an annual work plan for the next
twelve months — an action plan.

The model outlined in these articles is referred
to as Linear or Classical Planning. In his book
The Nonprofit Organization: An Operating
Manual, Thomas Wolf discusses the com-
parative advantages of the Linear and
Integrated models. In general he feels that the
Linear model takes too long (in some organiza—
tions six months or more) and does not always
involve everyone in the process as the staff is
sometimes excluded. While the model
discussed in this article is linear, I have tried to
address each of Wolf’s concerns. Specifically, I
recommend:

0 A focus on process as well as product.

0 Involvement of Board, Executive Director,
and staff.

0 A four day time frame over a month to six
weeks.

0 Written documentation (mission, goals,
objectives, and action plans).

0 A manageable review and monitoring
strategy.

The integrated model is more free wheeling
with less documentation and even greater pro-
cess orientation, but experience shows that
these plans are more likely to fail from lack of
commitment or follow through than those
created using the Linear Model.

In conclusion I would stress that, in Wolf’s
words, “The primary benefit of planning is
usually the process, not the product. Planning
is a structured way of involving a number of
people in thinking about the future, and often
this is its chief value.” This is not to say that
the product is not important — it is just that
without the involvement and commitment of
people the product may never be realized.

And finally, remember the words of Laurence

age. Others are spaying/neutering all adoptees
older than six weeks of age judged to be a
good surgical risk, and may refuse to adopt out
any dog or cat judged to be a poor risk for the
procedure. We also have found several facilities
that have expressed serious interest in the pro-
cedure and are considering instituting an early
spay/neuter program.

Because of the potential of early spay/neuter
to reduce overpopulation, and because it is
used at an increasing number of animal care
and control agencies, American Humane saw a
need to investigate and identify the known
advantages and disadvantages of the pro-
cedure, and aid shelters in developing
guidelines for implementation of such a pro-
gram, should they choose to pursue it.

AHA’s role on this issue is only to investigate

and inform. At this time, American Humane
neither approves nor opposes early
spay/neuter. While observations and
experience to date of the effects of early
spay/neuter have not been negative, there is
very little objective information available on
the short and long term effects of the pro—
cedure. Without this, AHA cannot advocate its
use.

American Humane recently brought together
eleven of the most respected experts in perti—
nent areas to discuss early spay/neuter, review
what is known to date and identify animal
health concerns related to early spay/neuter.
We convened a day long meeting of these
veterinarians and animal care professionals in
Chicago last August.

The participants were carefully chosen and
included: Dr. Suzanne Hetts, Animal
Behaviorist, Colorado State University; Ward

Thornton, President, Massachusetts SPCA and
Angell Memorial Hospital; Dennis J. White,
Director of AHA’s Animal Protection Division
and myself.

The meeting began with a presentation by Dr.

‘Kathy Salmeri, who reported on the findings

of her study of certain short— term effects of
early spay/neuter on dogs. Thirty—two puppies
from five medium to large mixed breed bitches
were studied for a period of approximately 15
months. The puppies from each litter were
randomly divided into three groups. Group I
puppies were neutered at seven weeks, Group
II puppies at seven months, and Group III pup—
pies were left intact for the period of the
study. All dogs were placed in homes at the
conclusion of the study, and all Group III dogs ..
were spayed/neutered at that time.

A brief synopsis of Dr. Salmeri’s results

showed:

0 Seven week (Group I) and seven month
(Group 11) old dogs responded similarly to the
procedure (which differed from intact con-
trols, Group III);

0 Small increases in the growth of long

0 Secondary sexual differentiation was
reduced in males and to a lesser extent in
females;

0 No differences in weight were attributable to
time of spay/neuter;

0 No problems were observed relative to the
urinary system (i.e., urinary incontinence)
but further studies with long term follow—up
are needed to evaluate this since such incon-
tinence may not occur for several years after
an ovariohysterectomy;

0 Hormone profiles were similar to anticipated
( i.e., reduced concentrations of sex hor-
mones after the procedure although fre—
quent sampling was not performed);

0 No behavioral changes were observed (but
the study was not designed to critically
evaluate this aspect);

0 The procedure was easy to perform; and

Early Spay/Neuter with early spay/neuter, which in the past 18
from page 5 months has involved the spaying/neutering of
bones; approximately 3,000 animals less than six

months of age.

Lee outlined the program and the benefits
observed:

Animals five and a half weeks of age or
older selected by a new owner have the
early spay/neuter procedure, but the shelter
retains ownership of the animal until after
surgery;

Animals are taken to their new veterinarian
for suture removal (a win/win situation for
the animal shelter as well as the veterinary
community);

The return-to—shelter rate decreased from
2000 to 2% after the procedure was
implemented (Lee believes the animals were
better socialized because of more interaction
with the shelter staff before and after
surgery, there was more owner commitment,

0 Recovery time was rapid.
Due to lack of funding and difficulty in track—
ing the dogs over time, no long-term study is
planned. No study has yet been done of the
effects of early/spay neuter on cats, even
though some kittens are being spayed/
neutered as early as five and one half weeks.

health care was improved, and the relation-

ship between shelter staff and veterinarians

became better);

Animals were identified with a tattoo next

exploratory surgery for spay/neuter).

Standards of Excellence: A Program For

The Standards of Excellence Program is the
cornerstone of American Humane’s national
effort to upgrade and improve the care and
handling of animals in shelters. The program
provides guidelines, evaluations and consulta-
tions to animal care and control agencies, g’v-

ing them direction in their continued pursuit
of quality care and service.

Standards of Excellence

from page 6

gram, Euthanasia, Community Relations and
Education, and Planning, the Standards of
Excellence Program supplies agency directors
with proven criteria to measure and evaluate
the effectiveness of their organization’s pro-
grams and practices. The Standards of
Excellence Program also provides the momen—
tum of a unified national network of profes—
sionals committed to excellence.

In the five years the program has operated,
certain questions and comments have been
heard and are responded to here:

I’ve seen the Standards of Excellence applica—
tion. It’s going to take me too much time to fill
it out.

Any initial review process can be lengthy. The
Standards of Excellence application is designed
so that the categories can be delegated to key
personnel to fill out, making completion less
time consuming.

We’re not going to apply unless we can achieve
all five categories.

It is not the objective of the Standards of
Excellence program for an agency to feel it
must qualify in all five categories or not at all.
The objective is the value of the evaluation
process and the knowledge gained from it.
Qualifying in any of the five categories is an
achievement about which any agency should
be proud. With the help of American
Humane’s comments and recommendations,
and as the agency’s programs continue to
develop, it should qualify in additional
categories.

We know of a shelter that is in the Standards
of Excellence program and we feel we are
better than that agency.

The evaluation process objectively considers
each agency’s individual policies and programs.
To recognize the diversity American Humane
has seen among its reviews of animal care and
control agencies, three levels of membership
have been created: Excellence, Standards and
Provisional.

How does the Standards of Excellence program
differ from other accreditation programs?

The Standards of Excellence is not an
accreditation program. It is a self-evaluating,
on-going improvement program.

What if we spend the money and time to
become a Standards of Excellence member and
we’re not accepted into the program?

The time and the money will be well spent
whether your agency is accepted or not. The
evaluation report you receive from American
Humane is invaluable as a tool for fundraising,
board objectives, operational assessment and
agency improvement.

We don’t believe in awards programs.

Again, the primary goal of Standards of
Excellence is the self-evaluation and review
process. You may choose not to utilize the
press release or display the certificate.
However, many agencies use this recognition
for public relations and staff morale.

We don’t need the Standards of Excellence Pro—
gram. We’re doing fine by ourselves and we
don’t want an outside agency telling us what
to do.

One of the primary advantages of the Stan-
dards of Excellence is to provide a network of
agencies participating in the program and the
opportunity to share ideas, success stories and
problems. Your input will make you part of a
national effort to improve the welfare of
animals everywhere.

What’s in the Standards of Excellence for my
agency?

Each agency will decide how to utilize the
Standards of Excellence program in order to
best suit their current and future needs and
goals. American Humane will provide the
“tools” for this improvement with guidelines
in the report of observations, comments and
recommendations.

You will also receive voting privileges in
American Humane and use of the AHA logo; a
news release for hometown media publicizing
the achievement of Standards of Excellence
membership; free subscriptions to Shoptalk
and the Advocate; a 25% discount on all
American Humane publications; discounts on
AHA annual training conferences and AHA
sponsored workshops; and legislative alerts on
issues that affect your agency’s operations.

Excellence Program can enhance your animal
care and control agency, call American

Part II

American Humane convened a meeting of 11
respected veterinarians and animal care and
control professionals last August in Chicago to
discuss early spay/neuter. This is the second
part of the report on that meeting. Please see
“Early Spay/Neuter: Risks and Benefits for
Shelters’,’ Part I, Shoptalk, Volume 7, Number
7 for additional information.

The effects of early spay/neuter on animals’
immune response was addressed by Dr. Ronald
D. Shultz, an irnmunologist from the University
of Wisconsin Veterinary School. Since surgery
represents a form of stress for the animal, it
was questioned whether subjecting the
animals to this stress while they are at an age
where they are being given their original vac—
cination series would potentially reduce the
immune response that would be developed. In
the opinion of Dr. Shultz, two factors would
protect against that problem. First, puppies
and kittens less than four months of age still
maintain a high level of protection from their
mothers. Second, unlike some other species,
the immune system of kittens and puppies is
fairly resistant to stress/glucocorticoids, thus
adverse side effects on the immune system
from the early spay/neuter procedure are not
anticipated.

It was noted, however, that certain anesthetic
regimes may alter immune response, i.e., lym-
phocytes’ function may be depressed with
halothane. Also, inhalation anesthetics could

75th Anniversary Observance

Celebrate Be Kind ”lb Animals Week,

May 6-12, 1990

Contact Congress To Support Legislation

The American Humane Association, the Amer-
ican Veterinary Medical Association, the Aux-
iliary of the AVMA and the American Animal
Hospital Association have joined forces to urge
the United States Congress to pass a resolution
declaring May 6-12, 1990 as Be Kind To
Animals and National Pet Week.

On January 23, Rep. Frank Guarini (D-NJ)
introduced H.J. Res. 458 in the House and Sen.
Pete Wilson (R—CA) introduced S.J. Res. 236 in
the Senate. The commemorative legislation
recoglizes both the 75th anniversary of Amer-
ican Humane’s Be Kind to Animals Week and
the 10th anniversary of the AVMA’s National
Pet Week, as well as the important contribu—
tions of animal care and control agencies,
humane organizations and veterinarians to
animal health and welfare.

American Humane urges all animal care and
control professionals to write their Represen-
tatives and both Senators to request that they
cosponsor and agree to vote in favor of these
joint resolutions. It’s important to point out

that this is a cooperative effort between
animal protection and veterinary medical com—
munities toward increasing public awareness
and understanding of proper animal care and
welfare. Letters should be sent to:

The Honorable
United States House of Representatives
Washington, DC. 20515

 

The Honorable
United States Senate
Washington, DC. 20510

 

The more letters your Representatives and
Senators receive from their districts, the more
likely the resolution will pass. At least 218
House cosponsors and 51 Senate cosponsors
are needed to pass the legislation. With the
support of local, state and regional animal care
and control professionals, American Humane
hopes to have the bill signed into law at the
White House during a special ceremony with
President George Bush.

Humane Education
Activities

American Humane announces a new publica-
tion called “Be Kind 'lb Animals Activities”.
This seven lesson publication is designed for
humane educators and teachers who would
like to teach their students about responsibility
to pets. The publication includes construction
and art activities, lessons on pet overpopula-
tion, situations with pets and an inventory of
pets owned by students.

Although these activities were designed to
supplement Be Kind ’Ib Animals Week, they
may be used at any time during the year, since
the lessons include important messages which
need to be reinforced.

The cost of the publication is $5.00 and it is
available exclusively through the American
Humane Association. For ordering informa-
tion, please see the address listed at the end of
this article.

for many pets is by volunteering at a local
animal shelter.

Mulligan, as evidenced by the special bond he
shares with Dreyfuss on “Empty Nest”, has a
special place in his heart for animals. He has
won a variety of honors and awards, including
a 1989 Emmy and a 1989 Golden Globe for
Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.
Mulligan, who also won an Emmy for his role
as Burt Campbell in the series “Soap”, began
his career as a playwright.

Arkansas First State 1b Make
Bear Wrestling A Felony

During its 1988/89 General Assembly, Arkansas
became the first in the nation to make bear
wrestling a felony. HB 1232 passed 95 to 1 in
the House, and 34 to 0 in the Senate and was
signed by the Governor on March 6. In the
same legislative session, passing 87 to 0 in the

House and 29 to 1 in the Senate, dogfighting '

was made a felony, which became law on
July 1, 1989. -

The two bills were passed through intensive
lobbying efforts by Arkansans For Animals, the
Arkansas State Animal Control Association
and the Humane Society of Pulaski County.

Julia M. Bumpas, President of the Humane
Society of Pulaski County in Little Rock,
explains that her organization hired a profes-
sional lobbyist to see the bills through.
Educating the public through the media to the
problems of bear exploitation and the cruelties
of blood sports was a crucial component of all
three groups’ strategy for successful legislative
advocacy.

Only nine states remain without felony
dogfighting legislation: Connecticut, Delaware,
Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maryland, New Jersey,
Vermont and West Virginia.

 

 

 

 




 

 

The Roles And Responsibilities Of The Board

Board Development (Part 1)

by Dennen Reilley

In my continuing work with staff and Boards
of humane organizations across the country,
there is one question raised more frequently
than any other and, not surprisingly, it is a
very difficult one to answer: “What are the
roles and responsibilities of the Board of
Directors?”

It is a difficult question because the roles of
the Board can be, within prescribed legal
limits, whatever the Board defines them to be.
Also, the roles and responsibilities change over
time as the organization moves through the
phases of its life cycle (please refer to “The
Board And The Organizational Life Cycle”,
Shoptalk Volume 7, Numbers 8 — 4). A con-
structive response to the question requires an
accurate assessment of the organization’s cur-
rent life cycle status. And more importantly, it
requires a commitment on the part of the
Board to assume the roles and responsibilities
required by the organization, even though they
may be quite different than those required
previously. Unfortunately, few of us, Board
members or not, are that ﬂexible.

Let me begin by stating that I have a real
preference for the terms “trustee” and “Board
of Trustees”. I believe these terms more cor—
rectly describe the role of the Board as guard-
ian of an organization for the community
which it serves. As 501(c)3 organizations,
animal welfare agencies are acknowledged as
serving an important public function. This
function is so important that nonprofit status
with corresponding tax—exempt status is con—
ferred so that all organizational resources can
be devoted to the achievement of the organiza—
tional mission. The Board is the guardian of
that trust.

There are several areas of responsibility shared
by trustees of all nonprofit organizations:

1. To determine the organization’s mission, set
policies for its operation, and establish its
general course from year to year.

2. To establish fiscal policy and boundaries,
and approve and monitor budgets.

3. To provide adequate resources for organiza—
tional programs through direct financial
contributions and a commitment to fund—

raising.

4. To select, evaluate, and if necessary, ter—
minate the appointment of the executive
director.

5. To develop and maintain a communication
link to all segments of the service area.

6. To ensure that the provisions of the
organization’s charter and the law are being
followed.

7. To provide for the continuity and the con-
tinuing development of the Board.

Equally important are those areas of respon-
sibility not appropriately undertaken nor
shared by trustees:

1. The Board does not engage in day—to-day
operations of the organization.

2. The Board does not hire or evaluate staff
other than the executive director.

3. The Board does not make detailed progam-
matic decisions, beyond involvement in
developing and approving the long range
plan.

Each Board area of responsibility listed will be
addressed in this continuing series of articles.
Long range planning was the focus of an
earlier series of articles (please refer to “The
Board And Long Range Planning”, Shoptalk,
Volume ’7, Numbers 5 - 7). This article and the
two to follow will address issues of Board
structure and development.

What are some of the things each Board
should do to insure it is doing its job well?
There are several areas that can be given
immediate attention:

1. Review the organizational by—laws to insure
that they foster responsible trusteeship and
are not designed to promote self perpetua—
tion by a few individuals who may or may
not have the competencies required at this
point in the organization’s life cycle. Is the
Board’s size conducive to getting the job
done or is it too large or too small to func-

continued on next page

 

 

 

 

 

4 »__— .___, “Why—Wt

 




 

 

tion effectively? While there is no “perfect”
number of a Board; most consider fewer
than nine members too few and more than
eighteen too many.

2. Prepare job descriptions for Board members
outlining not only the functions to be per-
formed but the competencies required. This
is equally important for old as well as new
Board members, but for those being asked
to join a Board for the first time the job
description will help them know prior to
selection exactly what will be expected of
them.

3. Establish if you do not already have them,
or review if you do have them, Board

policies and procedures. Do all members of
the Board have access to these in the form
of a Trustee’s Manual? And do the Board
policies and procedures address issues like
terms of office, attendance, financial com—
mitment, committee structure, recruitment
and selection of Board members, orientation
of new Board members, and a system for
the review and dismissal of Board members?

This. is where we will pick up next time detail-
ing some of the competencies that should be
resident on the Board and detailing the con-
tents of a Trustee’s Manual.

New Adoption Program Finds More Homes For Fets

 

Oakland SA

The Oakland SPCA’s Executive Directon Gary Templin, pictured with Baron, the Society’s “K— 9

Representative’,

In a unique cooperative effort, the Oakland
SPCA and the San Francisco SPCA have
established a program to find more homes for
abandoned animals. The Oakland/San Fran—
cisco SPCA Co-op Adoption Program enables
hard—to—place animals from the Oakland SPCA
to be transferred to San Francisco where they
will have a better chance for adoption, accord—
ing to Gary Templin, Executive Director of the
Oakland SPCA.

Templin and Rich Avanzino, President of the
San Francisco SPCA, developed the Co-op
Adoption Program. Avanzino describes the
program, which has given more than 300
animals a second chance at adoption since it
began in August, as a “win-win” situation,
benefiting the two organizations, the animals
and their new owners. “It fulfills the mission of
the San Francisco SPCA to find life—long, car—
ing homes for pets,” says Avanzino. The San

describes the program as a tremendous success.

Francisco SPCA also has Co—op Adoption Pro-
grams with the Animal Control Departments
in San Francisco, Oakland, San Leandro,
Hayward, and Contra Costa County.

“Before we launched this program,” says
Templin, “we assured ourselves that the San
Francisco SPCA adoption policies were consis—
tent with our own.” A task force from the
Oakland SPCA, Which included the director of
operations, a board member, and the super-
visor of the Oakland SPCA adoption program,
visited the San Francisco SPCA to review its
adoption procedures. “We were delighted to
find that their program is nearly identical to
ours. The emphasis is on placing the right
animal in the right home and a great deal of
care is taken to make sure that happens. In
addition, like the Oakland SPCA, the San Fran-
cisco SPCA provides veterinary services to the
animals in residence.”

 

 

 




 

 

 

Customer Service In Animal Shelters

Part I

Working for an animal care and control agency
is rarely easy. Especially on the front 11nes.——
the telephone, counter and kennel: Surpris-
ingly, the most difficult aspect of anlmal pro—
tection work for many of us is not dealing wlth
the realities of euthanasia or overpopulation,
but simply our day-to-day contacts with other
people.

Most animal care and control workers entered
this profession because of a desire to work
with animals. Our contacts with animals have
been, for the most part, pleasant and reward—
ing. Although our ethical perspective broadens
as we mature in our work, we usually begin
our jobs with a reverence for life and an
empathetic and caring nature. We assume that
the majority of others share our beliefs. Until
the first time someone calls us “murderers”.

The truth of the “animal business” is that it is
really a “people business” — intense and emo—
tional, involving confrontational experiences
with customers, co-workers and employees of
other agencies. An average day on the front
cOunter of an animal shelter will entail 60
public contacts — everything from euthanasia
requests to questions concerning operations
such as “what are your hours?”. Each contact
wears down our resources. If you add the
stress of euthanasia, the attempts to educate
the public and the physical demands of the job,
it is no wonder that animal shelter employees
burn out or burn up in a short period of time.
It’s a miracle that anyone takes on the

challenge to begin with and that some stay
with it for years.

The reason for most of us is the reason we got
involved in the first place — because of a deep
desire to make a difference for the animals
who cannot determine or control their own
destinies. Our responsibility to these animals is
to provide the best possible customer service
to the people who can and do affect the
animals’ lives. Without creating rapport, send—
ing the correct message and eliciting action
from others we will never have a significant

impact on the lives of the animals for which
we care.

Many shelter workers do an extremely compe—
tent job of coping with daily stress. These
1nd1viduals tend to have a highly developed
sense of self, good support systems and good

Leah turns to Lisa and says, “First customer of

It’s 7:15 pm. Dan has just finished cleaning
and feeding. The shelter closed at 7:00 pm. As
he passes the front door, he hears someone
knocking and calling him. He thinks, “I’ve got
to get home.” He slowly begins to . . .

Barbara is on the telephone. Jane, her super-

get someone out there right away. Sir, please
listen, your case isn’t an emergency.” Barbara
puts the phone on hold, looks up at Jane in a
mute appeal. Jane picks up the phone and
says, “. . .”

In the first example, Leah and Lisa waited for
the elderly man to enter the shelter and asked
him how they could help him. He was an
adopter who had returned to the shelter to
show off his new pet’s grooming and buy an
identification tag.

In the second scenario, Dan, in a hurry to get
home after closing time, answered the knock
at the front door and found a UPS driver with
a shipment of much needed vaccine for the
shelter.

And, in the third case, Jane learned the man
on the phone had just come home to see his
new garden ruined by a neighbor’s dog. He was
upset and frustrated, but just needed someone
to talk to and help him calm down. He turned
out to be a graphic artist who later donated his
time to paint murals in the shelter’s euthanasia

It’s human nature to rely on past experiences
to prepare us for future encounters. This
mechanism allows us to avoid repeated pain.
But it also colors our attitudes towards people
and situations we encounter on a regular basis
and in turn, it colors people’s responses to us.
How do you maintain a fresh perspective and
a positive attitude toward the fourth person
calling to complain about a barking dog?

Practice assuming the best instead of the worst
with this exercise. Before each encounter, take
a deep breath mentally and physically. Say to
yourself, “This person is my best friend. I
know them and like them. I want to help them
in any way I can.”

beginning stages of a respiratory infection,
since the ciliary function of the respiratory
tract would be temporarily depressed. More

experience is needed to resolve these
questions.

It was recommended that vaccinations should
be given when an animal entered the shelter,
rather than waiting until after surgery. In
order to determine if there are problems with
immune response in early neutered animals, a
follow—up survey of a number of animals
should be done one month after the operation.

should be done on two issues: evaluating the
effect on behavior of surgery done during the
“fear periods” which occur in puppies and kit-
tens at eight and 16 weeks of age; and
evaluating the animals’ approach to learning
tasks, given an unstudied concern that early

neutering might prolong immature behavior
patterns.

As with traditional spay/neuter at maturity,
early spay/neuter will reduce risk for reproduc-
tive disorders and lower risk of mammary car-
cinoma. Other conditions that might be

affected for better or worse by early
spay/neuter and which ought to be studled
include: perivulvar dermal it is, risk for urinary
incontinence, Feline l'rinary Syndrome,
vaginitis, balanoposthitis, obesity, and bone—
associated disorders such as osteoporos1s and
hip dysplasia.

A very important point on all these effects 15
the question of whether, it' undesirable s1de
effects occur, they exceed risks of the same
side effects in animals neutered at conven-
tional ages?

The actual surgical procedure was also an
important topic of discussion. All the feedback
from veterinarians performing early spay/
neuter emphasizes how much easier and faster
the procedure is when done at very early ages.
There is also general agreement that the
animals themselves seem to tolerate the prO-
cedure very well and recover more quickly and
painlessly than those neutered over SIX
months. The only problem area noted was the
tYpe of anesthetic used. There was concern
that a young animal’s liver would not act as
effectively as an older animal’s to process
anesthetics. Halothane gas was used overy SUC‘
cessfully with the puppies in the Florlda study,
but the puppies weighed at least four pounds
at the time of the operation and could b3
intubated easily, whereas an eight week 01

kitten is much smaller and intubation is
impractical if not impossible.

Ketamine, with or without an accompanying
tranquilizer such as Acepromazine or Rompun,
has been used at some shelters performing
early spay/neuter. The veterinary experts were
unsure of Ketamine’s effectiveness as an
anesthetic, but agreed that it would not be
likely to cause physical damage if administered
at appropriate dosages. It was agreed that
more study on anesthetics for early spay/
neuter operations was needed.

'Ib help identify those animals that have been

pre—pubertally neutered, American Humane is
suggesting a standard tattoo and establishing a
registry for shelters that wish to be identified
through the tattoo (see sidebar story).

From the information gathered to date on
early spay/neuter, American Humane has also
established guidelines for shelters considering
instituting such a program. As more knowl—

edge is gained we expect guidelines will be .

added to this list, and some may change. They
are not definitive, but they represent a “best-
effort” at this time. Readers comments and
suggestions regarding these Guidelines would
be appreciated.

The American Humane Association’s .
Early Spay/ Neuter Guidelines for Animal

Shelters

1. Shelter sanitation and immunization pro-
cedures should be highly evolved, in accor-
dance with AHA and AVMA standards.

2. Before being offered for adoption, animals
should be rigorously screened so that only
healthy, sociable animals are made available.

3. Screening of potential adopters should
include education on the need for neutering,
even though adopters have no option to not
comply. Adopters should understand what you
are doing and why you are doing it.

4. Animals should only be operated on after an
adoption application is approved, but owner-
Ship of the animal should not legally pass to
the adopter until after surgery is done. After
surgery, no animal who shows any signs of
complications or who is not fully recovered
from the effects of anesthetics or tranquilizers
should be released to an adopter. A minimum
eight hour recovery period is recommended.

5. Both a verbal and written explanation must
be given the adopter about:

A. Danger signs related to the operation.

B. How to get help if danger signs are
noted.

C. Precautions or procedures related to the
surgery (i.e., reduced exercise, cleaning
the incision.)

D. When to remove stitches, if necessary,
and who to have remove them. (Arrang-
ing for local veterinarians to remove
sutures at no charge is recommended as

it introduces the new owner to a
veterinarian in a timely fashion)

E. An explanation of any tattoo put on the
pet, particularly if the tattoo only shows
it has been spayed or neutered and does
not identify the animal’s owner or
reduce or eliminate the need for other
forms of identification.

6. All animals must be identified by a standard
tattoo as having been spayed or neutered. This
is vital to protect the animal from future
unnecessary surgery or examination. All early
spay/neuter animals should receive a tattoo
which, at minimum, identifies them as early
spay/neuter pets, and gives an AHA registered
code number to identify the shelter at which
the animal was neutered. Further coded infor-
mation by tattoo, computer chip, ID tag, or
other painless and non—mutilating means is
acceptable at the shelter’s discretion.

7. Whenever possible, agencies performing
early spay/neuter should seek or accept a
cooperative relationship with a qualified pro-
fessional conducting legitimate research on
early spay/neuter, provided that the research
procedures do not put the animals involved at
risk of pain or under stress, or interfere with or
jeopardize their enjoyment of home and
human companionship.

8. Records should be kept on numbers of
returned early spay/neuter animals with
reason for return noted.

Fundraising ls Just A Label Away

Shelters actively participating in the Gaines
Shelter Cash-In Plan continue to reap substan-
tial cash from the program through the
redemption of starred price markers from
Gaines Dog Food bags and can labels from
Gaines products. Each star redeemed from
Gaines Dog Food bags is worth $.20. Can labels
are valued at $.02. The stars and labels add up
— one Midwestern shelter recently received
more than $750. In addition to the ongoing
redemption, Gaines often conducts “bonus”

periods during which shelters can receive spe-
c1al awards.

Gaines regularly sends its newsletter, Starway,

to all participating shelters to keep them
informed on special promotions such as the
bonus periods. Starway also contains a ques-
tion and answer column that addresses
SPGCifiC questions from shelters as well as
many helpful hints. For example, every shﬁllter
supporter should be aware of the Games

ﬁAHA To Keep Organizational Tattoo Registry

For Early Spay/ Neuter Programs

Dogs and cats neutered pre-pubertally should
be identified as such for two reasons. First,
animals must be protected from experiencing
a second spay operation, or undergoing
unnecessary examination for cryptorchidism,
if seen by a veterinarian who does not have
access to the pet’s medical history.

Second, identifying animals that have been
spayed/neutered early will aid in tracking
physical and behavioral effects which may
develop over time.

American Humane is suggesting a standard
tattoo on the lower abdomen consisting of a
simple circle with a slash through it (see draw-
ing below). We will promote this symbol to
veterinarians and all shelters as denoting an
early spay/neutered animal. In addition, we
suggest shelters identify themselves with a two
digt number assigned by AHA to be tattooed
in the circle on either side of the slash mark.
We Will also promote to veterinarians and
shelters that AHA can be called to identify the
organization registered under the tattooed

number inside the circle. Any other tattoos or
markings on the animal should reﬂect the
shelter’s or the owner’s own identification
methods.

To obtain an assigned early spay/neuter
registered number from American Humane,
please send a dated and signed request on
your organization’s letterhead to ES/N Registry,
American Humane, PO. Box 1266, Denver, CO
80201—1266. Please specify in your request the
exact organization name, address, and phone
number you would like registered.

A tattooed circle with a slash (left) identiﬁes an
early spay/neutered animal. When a two-digit
number is tattooed inside the circle (right), the
number identifies the shelter that performed the
early spay/neuter operation.

‘ COUNCIL OF EUROPE: ,
CONVENHON 0N LABORATORY ANIMALS. TO ENTER MO FORCE

New Year's Day [1991 will herald the
"entry into force of another important
animalwelfame ”code. in the form of the
Council of EurOpe Convention for the
protection of vertebrate animals used for
experimental and scientific purposes.

Spain. Norway. Sweden and Finland. the
ﬁrst four European states that have
ratiﬁed the Convention, can thus start
applying its provisions from January 1.

The Convention has been signed. but not
yet ratiﬁed. by eight other EEC Member
States (Belgium. Denmark. France,
~ Germany. Greece. Ireland. the
{Netherlands and the; United Kingdom)
- and also by Switzerland and Turkey. The
‘ European Community as a whole has also

‘ signed it.

"The Convention's main objective is to

encourage laboratories throughout EurOpe to
reduce both the number of experiments and the
number of animals used for scientific experiments
and product testing and to dissuade them from
experimenting on animals altogther when other
alternative testing methods can be used. It
stipulates that animals to be experimented on
should be selected on the basis of
clearly-established quantitative criteria and must
be ~ well cared for and spared unnecessary
suffering wherever possible. Many of the
Convention's provisions are to be regarded as a
starting point for further welfare improvements as
the signatory counu'ies are planning to meet
regularly to broaden and imgirove the protectipn
of animals that have to be - used for scientiﬁc
research considered essential to human welfare
and the environment. (December 17, 1990 -

ALTERNATIVES: MOVING INTO THE ‘NINETIES

by Henry Spira
Coordinator of animal rights coalitions
PO Box 214 Planetarium Station New York NY 10024

In the past decade, despite predictions to the contrary, collaborative efforts
between scientists and animal protectionists have led, in the USA, to a whole
new field, the discipline of in-vitro toxicology, entering the scientific
mainstream. There are now university centres, data bases, scientiﬁc journals,
newsletters and books devoted to alternatives. And the subject is routinely
included in major scientiﬁc conferences, seminars and symposia.

How did these efforts get underway?

In 1958, W.M. Russell and R.L. Burch published their ground—breaking
study, The Principles of Humane Technique (Methuen & Co., London),
which suggested that humane science can also be better science. They
developed the concept of ahematives through the “Three R’s” — methods
which (1) ReplaCe the use of animals, (2) Reduce the number of animals
used, or which (3) Reﬁne existing procedures so that animals are subject to
less pain and suffering. Then, in 1978, the late David Smyth at the request of
the British Research Defence Society, published “Alternatives to Animal
Experiments,” (Scolar Press, London) which explored potential alternatives
in biology. As Russell and Burch had done, Smyth attempted the difﬁcult
task of defining where alternatives were possible versus areas in which
animal use, at the time, appeared essential.

And the movement toward alternatives gained energy from science’s self-
deﬁnition of questioning traditional ways of doing things and attempting to
think through what is really necessary and sufﬁcient for solving any problem.

Since 1980, this theme was also promoted by our animal protection
coalitions which maintained that much unnecessary animal suffering is due to
“creeping routinism,” and we suggested that this be countered by clear goals

19

and questioning of methods. I use “we” rather than “I” throughout this paper
to indicate that both the actions and the ideas described are the product of a
loose network of organizations and individuals with a variety of expertise,
meeting informally to develop and implement programs and campaigns.

One method of challenging “creeping routinism” is through our “zero-
based” concept of animal use. “Zero-based” animal use calls for examining
an institution’s entire animal research program as if it had just begun, from
ground zero, so that people do not mindlessly repeat what was done in
previous years. People and institutions tend to do tomorrow what they did
yesterday —— the zero-based concept counters this by encouraging people to
ask: “Is this research really necessary?” “Can this information be obtained
without using animals?” “With fewer animals?” “Mth less pain?”

Smyth had proposed replacement of the Draize test, which measures the
hannfulness of chemicals by the damage inﬂicted in the eyes of conscious
rabbits, both because it clearly caused suffering and because he felt that the
development of alternatives should not present any major scientiﬁc problems.
We concurred and decided to approach corporations that used Draize testing,
hoping to gain their collaboration in seeking alternatives. We began by
attempting dialog with cosmetics industry leader Revlon. At ﬁrst, Revlon
refused to consider the potential of alternatives, perhaps “considering the
source.” But after more than two years of protests, Revlon responded by
funding researchers at Rockefeller University to seek cell biological and
other humane alternatives, thus institutionalizing and carrying forward the
seminal suggestions of Smyth and others. This momentum and our
negotiations with Avon, Bristol-Myers, Estee Lauder and other major
corporations concerned with the image they were projecting, created the
Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University. This
program distributed many small grants, piggybacking the search for
alternatives onto massive research projects already in progress. This resulted
in established researchers entering the alternatives loop. In addition,
symposia and publications encouraged the networking of scientists
developing new methods. These initiatives were the “big bang,” -— an
immense leap forward in establishing the legitimacy and promise of
alternatives. They have generated new ideas and findings and spawned
similar major programs elsewhere.

At the same time, visionary high—tech entrepreneurs began to realize the
great promise in alternatives:

- The National Testing Corporation (NTC) developed the Eytex system, an
in-vitro alternative to the Draize, which includes a compound of 53
proteins resembling the composition of the eye. The solution in which the
compound is contained turns cloudy when mixed with substances that
would produce eye irritation, and remains clear in the presence of non-
irritants.

- Noxell Corporation has replaced the Draize with an Agarose Diffusion
method, at about one-tenth the cost.

0 Another Draize alternative, developed by Ellen Borenfreund at Rockefeller
University, is the neutral-red assay, which is performed in a tray of 96
wells, each of which represents a rabbit’s eye.

Similar progress has taken place in phasing out the 62-year-oldclassic
LDSO test. Just ten years ago, the LDSO was considered the foundation of
safety testing. Now, there’s almost unanimous agreement that the classic
LDSO is wasteful and unnecessary. And this change was due in large part to
our amplifying the criticisms made by leading toxicologists, including Dr.
Gerhard Zbinden, who in 1982 asserted that “clinical experience shows that
the LDSO value determined in animals rarely bears a meaningful relation
with the lethal dose in man.” Zbinden suggested regulatory change from the
classic LD50 to range-finding tests using one—tenth the number of animals
with careful observation. And Smyth had earlier pointed out the incongruity
of death being used as a test for sickness, a Lethal Dose 50% providing
assurances about non-lethal toxicity.

A turning point in the campaign was a letter from David P. Rall, Director of
the National Toxicology Program, who called the LDSO “an anachronism... I
do not think the LD50 test provides much useful information about the health
hazards to humans from chemicals, the NTP does not use the LDSO...”

Progress toward phasing down the classic LDSO and Draize tests has been
faster than expected. Ten years ago, replacing these tests appeared
overwhelmingly difﬁcult. But as events developed, the scientific clarity of
the objections to these tests, and support for alternatives from sectors of the
toxicology, corporate, and governmental communities have led to
encouraging results.

Over the past eight years, such major corporations as Avon, Bristol-Myers,
Colgate, Hoffman-La Roche, Johnson & Johnson, Mobil, Procter & Gamble

and Revlon, among others, have instituted structural changes to promote
alternatives. Some examples:

- Avon’s eight year program has culminated in a workable non-animal safety
evaluation process which includes in vitro alternatives, harmless human
clinical trials, and a massive data base of previous test results.

. Colgate-Palmolive’s initiatives include post-doctoral fellowships for
alternatives, successful development of the Chorioallantoic membrane

2|

assay (CAM) test for pre—screening new formulas and ingredients, and
increased use of computer data bases. Such initiatives have reduced
Colgate’s animal use by close to 90% since 1982.

- Hoffmann-La Roche has decreased its use of animals by 67% over a seven-
year period. One of the techniques that made this possible is computer-
assisted molecular modeling, which allows the shape and structure of an
experimental compound to be visualized in a three-dimensional image on a
computer screen.

0 Mobil Corporation replaced much of their traditional chronic skin cancer
testing on animals with the Mobil Modified Ames bacterial test.

- Procter & Gamble, in 1989 alone, spent almost $4 million on research into

alternatives. Their data base accesses over 30,000 non-clinical safety
studies.

- Revlon’s ten-year alternatives effort culminated in the company’s

promoting a new line of skin care products as “100% non-animal-tested
formula.”

- The National Institutes of Health, Procter & Gamble and our coalition
recently co-sponsored a feasibility study on data-sharing opportunities,
representing the ﬁrst such joint venture.

Accelerating scientific interest, activity and accomplishment in the
alternatives area bode well for the future. In line with this ferment, we are
now suggesting:

- That all animal users promote reduction, replacement and refinement, and

provide the public with an annual report of accomplishments and long-
range plans.

0 That all animal users educate their laboratory personnel in reduction,
replacement and refinement.

- That the USA ﬂagship of biomedical research, the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), establish cell science centers around the country as clearing
houses and training centers for alternatives, and that NIH set up a national
center for alternatives to coordinate the collection and dissemination of
alternatives information.

- That the NIH undertake a national laboratory animal utilization survey to
prioritize the allocation of resources for alternatives and to establish a
baseline against which to measure/track progress.

- That the NIH weigh animal suffering against the potential for human gain

before proposals are funded, — to assess “How much pain for how much
gain?”

The growing realization that “everyone wins” by these researches and

EDITORIAL

Professor B J Cohen

On Thursday 23 August 1990 Professor Bennett Cohen died. Professor
Cohen was Vice President of ICLAS and his passing away is a sad loss to his
many friends and colleagues and to ICLAS. In this issue Dr. Stian Erichsen
contributes a ﬁtting memorial.

ALTERNATIVE METHODS IN SAFETY TESTING

Elsewhere in this issue we publish an article by Henry. Spira on alternatives
to animal testing. The function of a research scientist is to illuminate and
increase our understanding of natural phenomena so that ignorance is bit by
bit eroded. Many who have worked in the ﬁeld of toxicology have sought to
improve the methods routinely adopted. The growth of alternative in vitro
methods has been just one aspect of developments in this area of science and
in vitro methodology is an almost inevitable consequence of explosive
developments in cell biology over the last thirty years. Indeed some of the
alternatives referred to in Henry Spira’s article have now been displaced.

Laboratory animal methodology thirty years ago was in many ways quite
primitive. Any research scientist worth his salt will be the first to
acknowledge this and to criticise his own procedures. Yet we should not
denegrate a science that has contributed greatly to advances in pharmacology
that have been accompanied by very few tragedies. Some of our present day
medicines rank amongst the great successes of our age. The Draize test and
the LD 50 test play very minor roles in modern toxicology - the LD 50 test
has sometimes been used in ways for which it was not originally designed.

The European Community has now agreed a satisfactory animal alternative
to this method.

One of the principal functions of ICLAS is to improve the knowledge and
expertise of those working with laboratory animals. The objectives of this
include an increase in the accuracy and precision of data derived, so that it is
more reliable, allowing fewer animals to be used. Greater knowledge and

expertise have indicated causes of stress in animals that can consequently be
eliminated or minimized.

Scientists are generally better at giving a rational explanation of
phenomena than of predicting them. This means that we are well advised to
proceed with caution in the adoption of new methods. It is relatively easy to
appreciate the deﬁciencies in procedures that have been used for many years.
Many in vitro methods are now a standard part of pre—clinical testing; but the
reliability of these methods for evaluating the safety of the wide range of new

chemicals being developed will depend on the absence of failures over a
period of time. The test of the validity of alternative methods will be a
statistical one that depends on no measurable increase in failures and
tragedies following the clinical use of new medicines. The proof or disproof
will become apparent over decades that procedures using both in vivo and in
vitro methods are, or are not, acceptable so that, both animal procedures and
in vitro methods will be required for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless
alternative arguments, and the expression of different ways of approaching
problems and issues, are healthy. They focus the mind on the real issues and
assure better solutions.

Direct experimentation in man avoids the unreliability of extrapolation
from one species to another. However for ethical reasons there is a limit to
which such experiments can be taken and in the ﬁnal analysis human
experimentation cannot be initiated before there is adequate evidence of
safety accumulated from in vitro and animal in vivo studies on each new
chemical to be tested. Thus a combination of in vivo and in vitro pre-clinical
tests combined with clinical tests is the only safe way to proceed. This of

course does not exclude continued improvements in methodology in each of
these fields. '

Dear Anita,

Thanks so much for agreeing to talk with your supervisor about the possibility
of placing a petition regarding bear hunting in some of the Mann theatres that
are showing "The Bear." This elusive, intelligent animal has been badly maligned
and persecuted for far too long; we appreciate the effect that showing a movie
like "The Bear" is having on projecting a more enlightened image of this animal,
and we would very much like to take advantage of this opportunity to persuade
Utah's wildlife officials to adopt a more sensible attitude toward "managing"
the state's bear population.

If you think this is something that we might work together on, I would very
much appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible, Anita. We would be more
than happy to provide additional literature, volunteers to distribute and collect
the petitions, or anything else you think might be effective.

Again, thanks so much for all the help and cooperation you have supplied. I
look forward to hearing from you.

YOurs very truly,

FTHTITON

we, the undersigned, are seriously concerned about the future of bears in the
state of Utah for the following reasons:

1) Very little information has been scientifically collected about bear habitat,
population structures, and the health of these populations. There are strong
indications that Utah's bear are overhunted and are declining rapidly.

The state of Utah allows the unsavory practice of spring "bear baiting,” which
is nothing more than enticing a hungry bear just emerging from its den to a
pile of garbage and then killing it. High percentages of females with cubs
are killed in this manner.

Utah also allows the pursuit of bear by hounds. Bears are relentlessly
chased and driven up trees by packs of dogs, a practice which terrifies
and stresses the bears. Of course, many are also eventually killed.

We therefore petition the Utah Wildlife Board, the state's legal body in wildlife
matters, to prohibit the pursuit of bears by dogs and the practice of bear baiting.

Changing the rules for bear hunts 1

Dixie NatiOnal Forest off1c1als are
thinking about changing their rules on
bear baiting -—- hunting bears by at-
tracting them with bait.

The problem foresters said, is that
the bait attracts so many bears that
they bother campers, hikers, and home
owners near the bait stations and hunt-
ing camps ‘

Until now, the forest has allowed
bear baiting if it is done at least 100
yards from Open water, public roads,
and designated trails and half a mile
from houses or campgrounds

. Forest Supervisor Hugh C. Thomp
son said the new requirement which was proposed after
discussions with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources
would reduce the area where the practice is allowed The
new regulations would ban bear baiting within 15 miles
of houses, summer homes or campgrounds

“The reason for this proposed change is because of
what we see as a dramatic increase in garbage bears " he
said. These are bears that have developed the habit of
raiding trash cans and camp sites.

In the past two years the number of bears either prey-
ing on livestock or causing disturbances in campsites and,
around homes increased dramatically In that time three
bears had to be killed, and one moved away from an area
where it was causing trouble.

“Also this year, a young woman was mauled -—— fortu
nately not seriously - by a bear,“ he said.

Some wildlife biologists think bears started raiding
camps after they began hanging around for easy meals
from bait stations, he said. - 1

“An increasing number of requests for baiting pernnts
is exacerbating the problem.

“Although a bear would certainly be capable of c0ver-

ing the 15- mile distance from a bait station to a camp-
ground 1n a relatively short time, we feel that the 15- mile
distance is a good compromise, ” Thompson said. The
new rule will still allow hunting over bait, but keep it far
enough from campgrounds and other inhabited areas to
mmunize the number of problem bears. ' , .

Where Are Utah's Bears? ?

The chance to see a black bear in the wild...
the sudden spotting of a bear cub in a tree...
the thrill of watching a sow and her' cubs
travel across a log in the dark forest.

These are some of the precious "little
values" the Utah Wilderness Association
wants to protect in Utah’s wild country. Many
of us will never have'the Opportunity-to
observe a bear in the wild; those who do are
counted among the fortunate. But whether we
spot a bear or forever carry with us the hope
that "this might be the day," the bear is a
creature of great mystery and wildness. a
creature to be cherished for its wildness.

Every year the Utah Wildlife Board hears
testimony from the public and presentations
from the Division of Wildlife Resources on
managementtand hunting seasons for Utah’s
black bear, cougar and furbearers. as it does
for all game species. 1989 marked a
significant change in bear management for
Utah. . i ’ '

‘ DWR responded to the increasing harvest of

bears by offering a "limited entry” hunt for»,
bears (and lions) in 1990; only ,142 bear
permits will be offered on a draw basis. This '

is a fine improvement from the 662+ afield

hunters in 1989 who encountered no barrier .'
but the $25. bear permit. The agency also

tightened the bear pursuit season, closed the

spring hunt to dogs. and offered an
experimental November hunt. In addition, a
successful bear (and lion) hunter may not
hunt the next year. All of these
recommendations were adopted by the board.

Until 1985. about 26 bears were killed
annUally by hunters; another 6 were killed by
government trappers for sheep depredation.
About 200 hunters were afield. In 1986 the

number of bears killed was 72; in the first 6

months of 1989 88 bears had been killed!
Likewise. hunters afield increased from 177
in 1980. to 364 in 1988. to an incredible 662 in
1989! ’ ‘ ' .
UWA has pressed DWR for years to limit the
hunt. if not stop it outright. until bear
populations are better understood.

Dangerous percentages of female bears are '

killed every year. Sows with cubs are
vulnerable to dogs set on their trail soon

after emerging from spring dens. Garbage ~

baits are set below trees strung with

archers’ platforms. Packs of dogs target _
» lethargic bears headed for their fall dens.

Herders and Animal Damage Control trappers
routinely kill.bears because of their "intent
to molest" livestock (UWA led the fight to
successfully remove that phrase from the
i988 proclamation!) We oppose the practice
of pursuit only--a weaponless chase wherein

the same animal is often repeatedly treed ”to

keep hunting dogs in shape" or as recreation
for those wanting to see the bears.

UWA supports the limited entry hunt as a
good first step but challenges the lack of
biological data indicating the tolerance of
Utah bears to such hunting presure. We want
the killing of females severely reduced.
Orphans are inexcusable. We testified in
opposition to a spring hunt (907. of all Utah
bears are killed in May and June, too many of
them female and/or immature), the practice
of pursuit only, the use of baits. the use of
hounds. and the Aunique-to-the-region

“November hunt. We encouraged the
" establishment of roadless "nonconsumptive

use" areas where populations will not be
hunted. offering a place for those who do not

hunt to try their patience watching for the

secretive bear. We are encouraged by DWR’s
recognition of and action toward solving the
intense presssure bears are encountering.

The black bear is an elulsive and beautiful
critter. The possibility of seeing one is
synonymous with the very value of
wilderness itself. We urge your involvement
to pursue additional important changes such
as an elimination of bear baiting.

UTAH WILDLIFE MANIFESTO
STATEWIDE SURVEY OF ATl'lTUDES TOWARD WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT

NEWS RELEASE: February 11, 1991

For more information, call Utah Wilderness Association: 359-1337

MAJORITY OF UTAHNS SUPPORT CHANGES IN WILDLIFE EOLICX

A strong majority (77%) of Utahns feel that non-hunting wildlife preserves should be established
within the state so that wildlife could live in their natural environment with a minimum of human
interference. And 84% believe that wildlife should be more important or just as important as
human interests in determining the location of the wildlife preserves. These finding are consistent
with the concepts embodied in the Utah Wildlife Manifesto.

This is the conclusion of a statewide poll conducted in January by Insight Research, Inc. of Salt Lake
City for the citizen group supporting the Utah Wildlife Manifesto. The poll was taken to sample
public opinion surrounding the issues of establishing wildlife preserves and the methods of hunting
both black bear and cougar.

In March 1990, the report ”A Utah Wildlife Manifesto: A Report and Recommendations for
Nonconsumptive Wildlife Management” was released by a group of concerned Utah citizens. The
Manifesto presented critical recommendations for wildlife management and a change in

perspectives from the present management currently underway by the Utah Division of Wildlife
Resources. Since its release, the Manifesto has been endorsed by prominent biologists, land
managers and organizations including the Utah Wilderness Association, Utah Audubon Society,

Uintah Mountain Club, Wasatch Mountain Club and Humane Society of Utah. The citizens charged that
the Manifesto was a realistic and freshly needed approach to the betterment and protection of

wildlife for all users, both hunters and nonhunters. In October 1990 the Manifesto group called

for establishing wildlife preserves in a portion of the High Uintas and in City Creek Canyon.

The poll informed respondents of the issues dealing with wildlife preserves and the methods of
hunting for black bear and cougar within the state. They were informed that bear baiting involved
attracting bears to a site to be killed by the use of meat scraps, pastries and grease, and that bears
could be pursued by trained dogs. Similarly, cougars could be hunted by using pursuit dogs to tree
them. About 72% of Utahns opposed baiting as a method of hunting bears, while 75% believed that
the use of dogs to chase and tree bears should be stopped. While some 47% of Utahns favored
continuation of bear hunting, 7 out of 10 or 72% favored discontinuing baiting as a method of
hunting. 21% supported continued baiting and 6% said they didn't know. There was very little
support to continue the use of dogs while hunting. 75% of those interviewed believed that the use of
dogs to hunt bear should be discontinued.

Results indicate that responses from hunting households were consistent with all responses in that
74% favored establishing preserves, 54% favor abolishing bear baiting and 60% favor
discontinuing hounding of bear. Utahns opinions were just as strong when asked about issues
surrounding cougar hunting. While 46% of respondents believe that continue cougar hunting should
continue, °.o IO‘I‘n‘ ‘Cq0‘00 0|| .l‘o h ‘00.. our 'qoi'"
WM. It was interesting to note that the results indicating a desire to ban
bear baiting, bear hounding, and cougar hounding were consistent across the spectrum of
respondents.

 




The telephone poll conducted during the 3rd week of January polled 607 people and represents an
accuracy of plus or minus 4%. The data also represents the state population accurately with
reference to income, age, gender, and geographical distribution. WW
I ‘ ‘ I' I II 'I I‘ II I III 'I II.” o r .I II. ' I' ' I ' ‘l ‘ An interesting
sidelight is that both members of hunting and sportsman groups (76%) and members of
conservation groups (81%) were definite supporters of establishing wildlife preserves. When
probable supporters were included 84% of sportman group members and 91% of conservation
group members supported establishing preserves.

interviewed believe that the use of dogs should be discontinued, with only 19% preferring the

The survey, jointly funded by the Utah Wilderness Association and the Utah Audubon Society, was
commissioned to determine Utahn's attitudes on these controversial issues and to assist the Utah
Division of Wildlife Resources and federal land managers in planning future considerations for
wildlife management. This survey indicates that Utahns favor these specific efforts which have
resulted from the Utah Wildlife Manifesto. The attitudes of Utahns are similar to the shifting
attitudes nationwide. Utahns appreciate the importance of wildlife to the quality of all life. Utahns
see hunting as a legimate sport but they see the chasing and baiting of wildlife as illegimate
unsportsmanlike destruction of a valuable native resource.

 




SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF WILDLIFE SURVEY
Insight Research: Raymond G. Briscoe, Ph.D. -- January, 1991

The wildlife survey was conducted by Insight Research, Inc. a professional public opinion polling
firm. Insight research personnel worded the seven questions, selected a random sample of six
hundred and seven Utahns, supervised their staff of telephone interviewers, tabulated the results,
and provided a full written report of findings. The full report is available through the Utah
Wilderness Association. ’

The margin of error for this sample is plus or minus 4%. The sample represents the state ‘
population accurately on income, age, gender, and geographical distribution. Forty-two percent of
respondents reported being from hunting households.

The following is a report of the questions and responses taken directly from the survey:

" Three current issues are wildlife preserves, bear hunting, and cougar hunting. The first two
questions deal with wildlife preserves. Wildlife preserves have been established in some states as
areas where wildlife are allowed to exist in their natural state without human interference.

Animals are studied, watched, and photographed to the extent that these activities do not interfere
with their well being. Wildlife are not pursued or hunted in preserves, but fishing is allowed.
Although wildlife are protected in national parks, there are no state preserves in Utah."

1. ”Should the state of Utah establish any wildlife preserves where animals could live with minimal
human interference ?"

Definitely Should 59%
Probably Should 18%

Data for this wildlife survey was collected by Insight Research, Inc., and
reflects the opinions of the people of the State of Utah during the time from
January 14—16, 1991. Six hundred and seven persons were telephoned, which repre—
sents an accuracy of plus or minus 4%. This data also represents the state popula-
tion accurately with reference to income, age, gender and geographical distribution.

 

When asked, "Should the State of Utah establish.wildlife preserves where
animals could live with minimal human interference," 77% of those surveyed
expressed support. 59% reported that wildlife preserves definitely should be

established. Only 21% voiced opposition.

ther than rural Utah and those respondents older than 60 years old, every
other demographic group was solid in its commutment that wildlife preserves should
be established. Both hunters and non-hunters alike were uniform in their philos-

cphy in support of preserves.

An interesting sidelight is that both members of hunting and sportsman groups
(76%) and.memhers of conservation groups (81%) were definite supporters of estab-
lishing wilderness preserves.

The next question was asked in an attempt to determine the interests of wild-
life compared to the interests of humans when considering wildlife preserves
locations.

Cf those expressing an opinion in preference, 46% responded that the intere5ts
of wildlife are either more or somewhat more important than those of humans, while
only 13% believed that wildlife interests are somewhat less or definitely less
important than those of humans. 37% voiced an equal level of importance.

Once again, the demographic groups who believed that the interests of wildlife
were more important, were the members of sportsmen groups (69%) and wilderness
g oups (66%). Moreover, hunters of big game (55%) and birds (55%) were also
very supportive of wildlife interests, while hunters of big game, bears and cougars
(32%) and hunters of big game, bears, cougars and birds (19%) were more supportive
of human interests.

Black Bear Hunting

Utah population tends to be almost evenly split as to whether bear hunting
ought to be continued. When asked "Should black bear hunting in Utah be continued,
or should the hunting of black bear be discontinued,?" 47% responded in favor of
continuing the black bear hunt, while 42% voiced support for discontinuing the bear
hunt.

As expected hunters of all types voiced support for the continuation of the
black bear hunt, while non-hunters supported the elimination of the hunt.




Also, of interest, the younger the respondent, the more supportive they were
of continuing the hunt. The 18—29 year group by a 54% - 37% voiced support, while
those above 60 voiced the most displeasure by a 32% - 43% margin.

While there was support for the continuation of general black bear hunting,
there was very little support to continue the use of dogs or baiting while hunting.

More than 7 out of 10 (72%) responded that bear hunting by baiting should be
discontinued, while only 2l% voiced support for its continuation.

Of all demographic groups only those who belong to sportsmen's groups (50%)
voiced support for the continued use of baiting.

The displeasure of all demographic groups of the use of baiting to hunt black
bear was widespread. Non—hunters (83%), and those from.Utah County (83%) were the
ﬁDSt against the practice.

Even though most of those responding, opposed the use of baiting to hunt black
bear, there was even more displeasure to the continued use of using dogs to tree
bears while hunting. 75% of those interviewed believe that the use of dogs to hunt
bear should be discontinued, with only 19% believing that this practice should be
continued.

Cmce again, all demographic groups were solid in their opposition to the
continuing use of dogs with the exception of neuters of sportsmen groups. In that
category 49% of their membership who were interviewed voiced support for the use of
dogs and 49% voiced their displeasure.

Cougar Hunting

As was the case with bear hunting, those Utahns interviewed were evenly divided
as to their feelings of hunting cougar in Utah. ‘When asked, "Should cougar hunting
in Utah be continued or discontinued, 46% voiced to continue cougar hunting, while
46% also voiced displeasure. 1

As expected hunters were supportive of continuing the cougar hunt. Addition—
ally; members of sportsmen's groups (63%), and men (54%) voiced support. On the
other hand non-hunters (55%), Davis County residents (65%) and women (51%) were the
Host Opposed to the cougar hunt.

The use of dogs however, while hunting cougars was very much found in disfavor.
73% of those interviewed preferred this practice to be discontinued, with only
22% voicing support.

Only members of sportmen's groups (52%) voiced support to continue the use of
dogs while hunting cougars. All other demographic groups were solid in their
Opposition to the use of dogs while hunting cougars.

Insight Research Election Data

BLE 20: I would like to turn to several questions
regarding wildlife manage- ment issues in Utah.
Three current issues are wildlife preserves, bear
hunting and cougar hunting. The first two
questions deal with wildlife preserves. Wildlife
preserves have been established in some states as
areas where wildlife are allowed to exist in their
natural state without human interference. Animals
are studied, watched, and photographed to the
extent that these activities do not interfere with
their well being. Wildlife are not pursued or
hunted in preserves,but fishing is allowed.
Although wildlife are protected in national parks
there are no state preserves in Utah. Should the
state of Utah establish any wildlife preserves
where animals could live with minimal human
interference?

The Idaho Department Of Fish and Game and.the Forest Service share a rich
tradition of cooperative management of the fish and wildlife resources on
National Forest System lands. This coOperative spirit is reflected in the
State wide Memorandum of Understanding (ECU), signed in 1983, between the
Forest Service and the Departmen-. This MOU emphasizes the right of the State.
of Idaho to administer State hunting regulations such as seasons, harvest
levels, and methods of harvest. It is also important to emphasize that the
Forest Service is committed to provide and enhance hunting opportunities on
the National Forests. ‘ ' -

The Commission will soon be making a decision on the State-wide Dlack Bear
Hanagement Plan, including the practice of bear baiting. We support the role
of the Department in determining whether bear baiting should continue as a
sport hunting practice. However, Idaho Department of Fish and Game
regulations also recognize the role of landowners and managers, public and
private, in managing bear baiting activities. The Forest Service must manage
activities on National Forest System lands consistent with other land
.management objectives. Therefore, as a cooperator and a land management
agency, we feel it is important that we, the Intermountain and Northern
Regions of the Forest Servi ce, jointly share our concerns and provide our
recommendat on regarding the bait ng of bears ,1_' 7g., . ;‘~

As managers of public resources , we feel. it is important that hunting be _
conducted in a manner that reflebts well on hunter conduct. The use of salt

From “Bear—A—Van” to “Bear Brigade”
—Battle’s Just Beginning

On August 15, scores of people from all
over the state made the long journey to
Vernal -— a rural community nearly on the
Colorado border — to speak out for Utah’s
bears. Immediately upon entering the build-
ing chosen for the meeting, the members of
the “Bear-a-van” saw that they were obvi-
ously deep in alien territory: The very ﬁrst
sight that met their eyes was the stuffed
heads of nine or ten dead animal “trophies”
hanging on the walls of the foyer; the
meeting room itself was decorated with
pictures of favorite “game” animals like
cougar and bighom sheep; and the large
hunting segment of the native populace,
which had turned out in force, presented an
unbroken landscape of boots, big belt buck-
les, and baseball caps, the standard uniform
of the bucolic sportsman. When certain
members of the wildlife board jovially
hailed some of these people by ﬁrst name
and made solicitous inquiries about their
families, there was little room left for specu-
lation regarding the general trend that the
day’s proceedings would take.

Defenders Undaunted

However, those who had come so far to
speak out against the baiting and hounding
of Utah’s rare, elusive bears refused to be
intimidated by the generally hostile ambi-
ence. With reason, eloquence, and hard
facts, they pleaded for a more civilized
approach to interacting with the other spe-
cies who inhabit the world. Their list of
logical arguments included these points:

0 The bear’s diet is 90% vegetarian;
when bears do feed on meat, it is usu-
ally carrion. In 1989, the sheep report-
edly killed by bears amounted to
0.002% of the total ranch population,
and, in any case, livestock ranchers are
compensated by the government for
these losses.

0 Bears are extremely slow to reproduce.
The females may not breed until they
are between ﬁve and seven years old,
and may go three or four years between
breedings. The litters are small — one
or two cubs per birth.

- The spring bear hunting season begins
when hungry soWs with their cubs are

 

emerging from their dens. Ninety per
cent of all Utah bears are killed during
this period. Too many of the animals
“taken” are female or immature.

- The hunting seasons which were in
effect at the time of the hearing allowed
bears to be hunted for ﬁve and a half of
the seven months they weren’t hiber-
nating.

o The two most popular methods of kill-
ing bears -— hounding and baiting —
account for 88% of the kills. Both
practices are treacherous, cowardly
means of catching an intelligent and
elusive animal that would, in a fair
contest, be more than a match for most
of its human opponents.

- The bear “harvest” during each of the
last four years has been two to four

/

times greater than the annual “harvest”
of the preceding 20 years. Yet the DWR
cannot even provide solid evidence of
how many bears actually exist in Utah,
or what percentage of the population
is being killed.

The one and only argument presented by
the hunting contingent was that they ﬁnd it
a lot of fun to pursue and kill these noble
creatures so they can have a rug or a trophy.
But, as one animal defender pointed out, this
is 1990— not 1890. We’re living in an age
when most human beings have evolved
beyond deriving pleasure from such sense-
less destruction of animal life, and it’s an
outrage that our appointed ofﬁcials continue
to pander exclusively to the tiny pocket of
backward-looking values represented by
these people.

The hearing itself was the longest on

schedule another public hearing until 1992.

Making a Difference

There’s absolutely no reason, however,
to look upon these results as defeat. We all
knew that the voting would go basically the
way it did long before the idea of the Bear-
a-van was even born. Rather, our goals were
to make public declaration of the many
sound objections to the bear hunt; to pres-
ent a stiff wave of resistance to a board
which has hitherto made all its policies with
very little interference from the non-hunt-
ing majority; and to raise public awareness
of the disgrace and the tragedy of the cur-
rent bear “management” program in Utah.

And from that standpoint, we succeeded
beautifully. The very fact that there was no
public announcement of the board’s rulings
is one stmng clue that the DWR fears a ﬂood
of adverse public response to its policies.
And, in extending the time between hear-

ings to two years instead of one, the wild
life board appears to be hoping that they ’v-
bought endugh time for opposition to jus
fade away and let everybody forget abou
the whole thing.

But that’s where they show once agai
just how out of touch with the spirit of th
times they really are. Any educated, knowl
edgeable individual is aware of the numer
ous indicators showing that it’s the destroy
ers-of-wildlife-for-kicks that are heading 0 '
into the last sunset, while defenders of th
precious planet and all of its equally pre
cious inhabitants are growing more plenti
ful and more powerful every day. Those 0
you who sacriﬁced a day to be at the Vern ..
hearing were part of that forward-movin
trend, and your voices were heard.

We’ve got two whole years now t
spread our educational messages and en1i~
the aid and backing of people all over th
state. To everyone who went to Vernal .

Several people wrote to the Humane Society of

the trip to Vernal to express their feelings about the
DWR’s bear hunting policies, they nevertheless
wanted to make their opinions known. We carried
their letters with us to the hearing, and are also

— Carol Gay, Wilson

Roy, UT

It will not be possible for me to join your Bear-a—van to go to
Vernal to protest the inhumane, unsportsmanlike hunting that is
taking place in Utah; however, I would like to submit this letter
as my proxy vote against baiting and hounding of bears if the
Society ﬁnds it ﬁtting to present letters in protest.

Any man who is man enough to go into the bear’s territory
and hunt him down and kill him — man vs. beast ——- has my
respect (although I do not adhere to animal killing as “sport”),
but to entrap any animal by ﬁrst feeding it and then killing it
after it has become conditioned to accept food is far from sport-
ing. I feel a concern about this also because bears becoming

used to bait donuts would not refrain

 

damage control ofﬁcers, and I condemn the
barbaric practices of bear baiting and
hounding, or pursuit-only with hounds.
This is not 1890, it is 1990, and we are
supposedly civilized people. How then can
you condone these deplorable acts of bar-
barism? The savagery of baiting a hungry
bear to kill it and leave the cubs mother-
less and unable to fend for themselves
should go against the grain of any but the
hardest human beings.

George Bernard Shaw posed this ques-
tion to those indifferent to animal rights:

 

 

from going after campers’ supplies as
“fair game.” It is conceivable that some
innocent humans might eventually be
endangered by this practice. Hounding
is not much more sporting, since it pits
one lone animal against not only the
human hunter, but other animals as well.

There can be no reason to increase
the number of bear permits, either, other
than the "economic one of the state’s col-
lecting more license fees. This should
not be done.

then say no to baiting and hounding.

I would like to make this statement on behalf of my family,
friends, and probably a good majority of the people of this state.

As a lifelong resident, I have never had the privilege of see-
ing a black bear in the wild in Utah, and although you no longer
see the roadside bear in Yellowstone, there is still the thrill and
mystery of knowing they are there ——- maybe just out of your
sight. Bears add an exciting element to the wilderness. They
belong there, and in more areas and more numbers.

I was appalled and disgusted to hear about the current bear
management and harvest in Utah! Bears should NOT be hunted,
but rather protected. Poachers are killing black bears across the
country for sale of their body parts to Asian hunters. If policies
are not changed, the black bear will surely follow the way of the

IT IS NO LONGER WINTER...

Imagine the darkness of a den, the strong odors of several months of sleep for a female bear who has miraculously given birth to two cubs during '
that long sleep, waking voracious and with the instinct to provide food for herself and her two squalling cubs. In the bright sunshine of the April morn-
ing, she emerges on the winter mountain, rolling over logs for grubs and insects that have likewise emerged from the grip of ice. On these and the first
succulent vegetation of the year, she feeds and lies in the sun to suckle her youngsters. Days grow longer; more plants emerge. She travels farther
from the den. Following the greening path of stemsand leaves, she is drawn by the attractive scent of carrion. She has tasted deer, victims of harsh
winters she has passed in her den. She moves her cubs to the bounty of food. A rustling in the pines behind her startles her; her nose sitting the
scents of May, she barks, sends the cubs up a tree, then approaches the rotten ﬂesh. She lowers her great head to eat.

It happens fast; her shoulder burns with pain. She roars, slaps and bites at the shaft embedded In her hide. Another hits. She collapses into a
stinking bait of pig guts, stale doughnuts and bacon grease. They clamor down from the platform in the trees, tug and strip off her hide and head, roll
and pack it to their truck parked on the roadside a quarter of a mile away, and drive down the mountain. The cubs bawl In hunger and confusion.

A FASCINATING BEAST... Utah's Black Bear

 

 

 

The black bear, W, is an elusive and beautiful creature. lt lives
its life in the distant corners of a range more and more compromised by development
of our public lands. It is dependent on wildlands and is a barometer of, our humaneness
toward land and all of its wild inhabitants. As a species, bears are stocky with short
legs, necks and tails. They have five toes and walk on the whole foot, with a pigeon-
toed inturning of the front feet. They strike, handle, dig, and climb with the forefeet
only. Then can run swiftly and have long, nonretractable, curved claws. Their 42
teeth include pointed canines and crushing molars. Bears can stand on hind legs to
reach, fight or observe. They are powerful swimmers, their noses can detect odors

at 12 miles, and they'can hear human conversation at 1000 feet. »

Befitting the mystery of the black bear is the fact that it is not always black. Most Utah sightings are of light brown (blond) to dark cinnamon brown
bears. Pelt may darken as the year progresses. There is even some variation in the same coat. Mothers often produce litters of different colors.
Females, or sows, may weigh from 90-155 pounds, while males, called boars, may weigh between 130-310 pounds. Sows may not breed until they
are between 5-7 years old and may not reproduce for 3-4 years. Bears breed in June-July, and gestation takes 7-8 months with white-chested cubs
arriving in January-February. Blind, nearly hairless, and only eight inches long, the new cubs may weigh only 10 ounces at birth.

Denning, an adaptation to COping with limited food and the lowest temperatures of the year, can be counted as one of the true wonders of nature,
WWW Body temperature drops, oxygen consumption drops 50%, and only 4000
calories are burned daily-- an incredibly efficient system that allows body fat to diminish only 30% , providing water and food as it metabolizes. Even
more miraculous is that from November until its April emergence, a female could be giving birth, suckling and sheltering a litter as she “sleeps." The
bear truly exhibits the most remarkable and graceful patterns of survival.

The new mother, her stomach empty and appetite dominant, introduces her offspring to aworld of melting snow, roaring streams and succulent
plants. For the first 2-3 weeks the family stays near the den. The sow may breed the following May or June, when her cubs are yearlings. They will
spend the next winter with her as well, barely able to survive without her before the first August, when the berries are ripe and plentiful, unless a
drought claims the fruit as it does the streams and all that grows along the banks.

Bears usually prefer den sites on north, northwest or west aspects of slopes. Dens are often enlarged holes dug under the base of trees or rocks
or in a cavity in a brushy ledge or talus slope. First to enter their respective dens are pregnant females, followed in time by barren females, subadults
and adult ,males. The reverse is true when they emerge. Pre-denning lethargy and tracks in the snow near the den make bears vulnerable to hunters.

The History of Bear Management in Utah

Bears were considered to be varmints and it was legal to take any number
of bears at any time until l967, when bears (and lions) were classified as
game animals by the Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR).

From I973-‘76 the bear season ran from January to December (except
during the October deer hunt.)

From l977-l989 DWR offered a split bear hunting season: April 15-June 15
and September 1-October 15.

The bear harvest during each of the last four years has been 2-4
times the annual harvest of the last 20 years!

BEAR MANAQEMENT IN 1929

Management of bears for the arcane purpose of baiting or hound dogs by pursuing bear beyond fear and exhaustion violates all standards of
ethical treatment of wild animals dependent upon tiny islands of habitat to survive in miraculous ways.

Unlike deer, elk, or moose, even mountain goats, bighorns or pronghorns, bears are pursued and hunted for 70% of their lives out of the den...hardly
the decency we owe wild animals. h r f iv n h l f h ir 7 n h “ w ” r '

Before the winter snows have melted and as soon as cubs have emerged from the den, the spring hunt begins. From April 14- June 3, hunters
and hounds, or hunters with archery tackle and piles of bait, are permitted to “harvest” Utah bears (see front page.)

Another season, "pursuit only," extends from April 14-July 31 and allows bears to be chased by dogs for fun. No weapons are allowed. The month
of August has no hunters afield. Another hunt runs from September 1 until October 16. No hounds are allowed on this hunt... THIS YEAR. Again there
is a "break" from October 17- November 2, although 200,000 hunters are afield searching for mule deer from October 20-30. Yet a third bear season
runs from November 3 to 30. Hounds and rifles, bait and archery... "anything goes" during this month when sows and young enter their dens. There is
no hunt from December1- April 14, 4 1/2 months of peace and brutal plunges of the thermometer. *

The primary reason bears are hunted in Utah is the “impressive” value of abear skin rug. The magnificence of the wild bear merits a
varied management scenario, one that includes offers ecological/nonconsumptive opportunities.

Legend and literature speak of universal sacredness of the bear. Terry Domico in his eloquent
book, W says, "Bears are the embodiment of the untouched wilderness, the
natural and untamed." They move through their world with such incredible grace and purpose
that we are left in awe and fear. The bear never seems to come or go--it simply appears in a
patch of willows. In our world the bear has been described as an old man with fur, hopelessly
' out of place and unable to survive.

And we are rapidly destroying its habitat. We've pushed Utah's black bears into fragmented and
isolated tracts of land, often ringed by developments, logged, roaded and overgrazed. Combine this

with a hunting season that lasts almost the entire length of the bear's waking days and its survival
is miraculous. Thus a two pronged effort is needed to assure Utah's small black bear population
some degree of survival without harassment. First, its habitat must be preserved-that has been
UWA's approach over the last decade. And now we must provide some security within that habitat.

We have called for protection of bear reserves, limited hunting and elimination of bear baiting
and hounding. Combined, these assure a decent survival and show the integrity humans must
possess toward wild animals trying to survive in limited habitats. It also assures that bears will
be managed for their ecological uniqueness and beauty rather than simply harvests. This broadens
the management of the bear to include all users of wildlife, including the nonconsumptive wildlife
user. To this point in time the ecological, aesthetic and nonconsumptive values of Utah's black
bears have been ignored. ,

Some have asked why we are focusing on bears, mountain lions and pine martens. These specie
are either top-order predators or require large tracts of undeveloped land for survival. They
dominatetheir landscape despite low densities and massive habitat requirements. Hunting and
trapping have diminished their numbers over the years and are not necessary to manage such
fragile and area-dependent species. They are barometers for both specific habitats and ecosystem
quality and they depend upon our humaneness to survive in a shared world.

Every year the Utah Wildlife Board sets harvest seasons and accepts public comment. on the various aspects of hunting bears in Utah. Last year an
incredible 112 bears were krlled...the highest in over twenty years of record-keepingl Yet the Division of Wildlife Resources cannot provide solid
evrdence of how many bears are actually in Utah or what percent are annually killed. Estimates of Utah bears have ranged from 400 in I983 to 600-
1000 in I989. When 1989’s bear hunting permits skyrocketed to 687 (up 200 from I988; up 300 from l987l), the Utah Wilderness Association de-
manded that permits MUST BE limited! DWR responded by offering its first limited entry hunt (142 permits for the I990 season). The number of bears
killed so far in l990 is 15. DWR estimates that the total I990 harvest could be twice that number. ‘

On the surface, the lower kill is a relief. However, could harvest of this slow-to-reproduce mammal have been so intense over the last five years

that the population has “crashed” from overharvest? Could the Utah bear population be overharvested in certain regions and sparse if not eradicated

in others? We have yet to be assured. ’

That’s where you come in!

COME TO THE HEARING OF THE UTAH WILDLIFE BOARD IN VERNAL AUGUST 15. Let the board know you came a long distance to defend Utah
black bears. If the Utah Wildlife Board doesn’t see a sea of faces begging to speak out for bears, the public pressure/effort to keep excessive numbers
of bears from being killed will beset back many years. Sign a speaker’s card when you enter the auditorium to guarantee your few minutes at the
microphone...and a voice for bears.The meeting starts at 1:00 with a presentation by the DWR bear biologist. Comments will be accepted thereafter

SONAL RESPECT AND APPRECIATION FOR THIS WILD PREDATOR. SPEAK FROM THE HEART! CONSIDER ADDRESSING THESE POINTS.

PEAK TF R TAH' BEAR !

Qppose the barbaric practice of “baitingt‘Baiting is nothing but littering a site with rotten food (calf carcass; doughnuts, frosting, bacon

grease, spoiled fruit, pig guts) to draw a bear within range of archers perChed in chairs in a tree. Hungry sows emerging from dens with cubs are
particularly susceptible to baits set within their small range. Is it any wonder bears encountering as many as 140leg‘al bait stations in Utah in l989
learn to seek camp food and earn the deadly reputation of "problem bears?" in the limited entry 1990 season todate, only one bearghas been killed

over bait. Yet the practice has not improved. Bear baiting is nothing but littering to kill bears. How can such an arcane praCtice be allowed to continue?

Qppose the hunting or pursuit of bears with HOUNDS. Females with cubs are. particularly vulnerable to dogs set on their scent. Their range
is so limited. Baiting and hunting with hounds unfairly equip Man. This physiologically stresses and harasses the predator. In the pursuit season, a

houndsman may run his dogs on and corner a bear that has no escape. Where is the sport?

Support a limited entry bear hunt. UWA recommends setting the number of bear hunter permits at 100. Facing the bear on its terms, in

its country, without the unfair advantage of bait as lure and dogs as tools of terror, Utah will be more in line with what Leopold and other farsighted .
sportsmen envisioned as "the clean hunt." Ask DWR for evidence that Utah's bears can tolerate such a harvest level.

We have learned DWR is going to ask the Utah Wildlife Board on August 15 to raise the 142 permits it offered in l990 to about 170 permits for I991.
Already DWR is abandoning its promise to hold the permit level downto enable the agency a chance to examine what is happening with Utah's bear
population. DWR concedes this increase is in response to complaints by the livestock industry that not enough bears werekilled in Utah in the spring
I990 season. Only 1050 sheep were reportedly killed by bears in l989, about 0.002% of Utah's sheep lost to bears. This emphasizes that our
bears and lions are being managed as targets and pests, not the incredibly valuable wild predators they are! ~

Qppose any bear-killing by Animal Damage ContLoj while livestockmen are being compensated for their losses (according to a new I990
Utah law.) Bears are an inconsequential problem to Utah livestockmen! .
Support the creation of bear preserves in each of the five Utah DWR regions. In each region, two preserves (of at least 20,000 acres rn

bear habitat) should be established: one will be in a developed, heavily hunted region; the other will be in a roadless, lightly hunted region. The oppor-
tunity to study population dynamics will be most important in the understanding of Utah's bear. We want to help the bear regarn the stronghold in Utah

terrain it has been forced to abandon.

animal has earned so many popular names as the stealthy cougar! . , _

The magnificent, secretive cougar is a highly specialized predator, adapted to locate, capture and consume prey. it is a solitary hunter, stalking and

rushing in ambush rather than chasing its prey over a distance. lts prey have likewise adapted swiftness and protective coloration to survwe. ThIS _
tawny athlete sprints and leaps magnificently. Individuals have been known to bound 40' laterally or jump onto a ledge 18' overhead. Its fleXIble spine
and digitigrade locomotion (walking on the toes) give it a longer stride. The male cougar averages 6 1/2 feet long (excluding its three foot taill), stands
about 2 1/2 feet at the shoulder and can weigh 200 pounds. The female is somewhat shorter and weighs between 80 and 130 pounds.

The stereoscopic eyes of this superb hunter offer excellent night vision: they can see at only 1/6 the light intensity humans require. Its voice can
range from whistling, mewing and growling to a haunting roar. Massive canine teeth in a muscular, formidable jaw allow the cougar to deliver a lethal
bit. Molars slice and shear flesh, tendons, and small bones like scissors. And the cougar’s tongue, like a domestic cat’s, is rough with spike-like
projections to lick flesh from the bones. The cougar makes short work of eating, usually bolting its food to keep other carnivores or scavengers from
taking it. .

The cougar’s prefered diet is deer. Historically their habitat is synonymous. Besides the 50% fare of deer, lions eat skunks, porcupines, rabbits,
mice and a little grass to aid digestion. Annually, cougars eat 4-6 pounds a day (or one deer about every 2 weeks.) But this feast or famine schedule
depends on the availability of weak, old and young prey. Cougars frequent rocky, steep terrain with rugged ledges and divides from which they can
more readily take down deer. ‘

At age two, cougars are ready to breed, and then at 2-3 year intervals thereafter. 1—6 kittens are common in litters. At less than one pound, with
black-brown spots and dark rings around their short tails, kittens are blind for the first two weeks. Teething ends at one month. At 6 weeks the female
takes her kittens to a kill site to feed until the meal is gone, then moves her litter from kill to kill, not to return again to the home den. For 4-5 months
milk and scraps of meat sustain the young cats. At 6 months the kittens weigh 30 pounds, spots have faded, and they are robust hunters. They can kill
small prey at age one, but stay with their mother until nearly two years old.

Adults have exclusive home ranges, avoiding rather than confronting other cougars to maintain spacing. Boundaries are marked by scrapes, urine
and feces. Neighbors may overlap home ranges but rarely use the same areas at the same times. Cougars may keep the same home range for life.
Young disperse long distances from the birthplace and their mortality is high during this colonization so necessary to increase genetic diversity.

Failure to establish home range suppresses reproduction and limits the population.

Hunters reported treeing Utah lions over 2000 times in l989!

During the pursuit season (dogs only), cougars were freed another 1200 times. Thus on over 3000 occasions in l989 cougars were chased, har-
assed and freed by hounds. Do not confuse this to mean 3000 separate cats were treed. Many big cats are treed repeatedly. Houndsmen, the Wildlife
Board and UDWR biologists have dismissed concerns that this intensely pursued population suffers serious physiological effects from such constant
running and harassment. The regulations forbid the repeated pursuit (“chase, tree, corner or hold at bay”) of a single animal in a single day. But there
is nothing to prevent the treeing of the same lion many times in the far reaches of this public land state.

UDWR has no idea of the number of cougars in Utah, with only one long term study on Boulder Mountain undertaken.
mliin 1 nnR mninfr

The I990 season is the first limited entry hunt for cougar in the 23 years of cougar management in Utah. DWR offered 525 permits for a January
1 to July 31 hunt. Pursuit permits ( hounds only) are unlimited in the I990 season (Dec. 16, l989-July 31, 1990). Of the 210 LIONS KILLED TODATE
(June 25, I990) an. incredible 86% of those lions were killed in January-February (the traditional high kill period.) The annual average number of
lions killed from 1971-1980 was 151 ; the average from I981 to the present is 191. DWR offered a limited entry hunt to pare the number of hunters
afield and permits sold, not to reduce the kill: "We want to keep the annual harvest rate right around 250 cougars."
Why 250? How many cougars does Utah have? DWR is proposing to raise the number of permits for I991 and extend the hunt two weeks in

December to allow more cougar to be killed when hunting conditions are prime for tracking the beautiful cats in snow with packs of
hounds. '

 

When the Utah Wildlife Board sets the l991 season for cougar in August, we need your help to support the following, critical points. Please
take the day off to speak out for UTAH COUGARSI

illi n n I
Aside from the severe and unnatural stress of being chased and treed on a continual basis, there exists an obvious threat to kittens, by far the most
vulnerable. Kittens under six months old do not travel with their mothers. Kittens don't know to tree when dogs are on their scent. It is not uncom-
mon for females to be treed, chased or killed and their kittens orphaned and starved. Although regulations do not allow freeing or killing lions with
kittens, there is no way to know when a female lion has kittens. By 9-12 months, kittens have lost their spots, males may be larger than their mothers
and they are spending more time on their own. They become the easy victims of hounds. 21% of hunters responding to the obligatory DWR question-
naire after the cougar hunt reported too many females and kittens are being killed. The subadult kill for l989 was 30% of the total harvest. Intentional or
not, many kittens are likely being orphaned and large numbers of subadult recruitments arealso killed by hunters. THEREFORE“..- . .

Just how stable is the Utah lion population? UDWR says,“Despite the increasing harvest pressure, the overall cougar population appears to be at
least stable, as illustrated by the significant increase in the number of cougar freed/hunter day.” At the same time Summit, Fish Lake and Pine Valley
hunting units “continue to need intensive monitoring to determine if harvest is exceeding available surplus" (W
MB. page 12i- -' ,

The'simple matter is that very little is known about Utah's mountain lions. The lion is managed for hunting only, on "seat of the pants" data. We
recommend the creation of two large reserves (at least 20,000 acres) in each of the five DWR regions: one in which cougar populations have been
lightly exploited; the other in which lions have been exploited in more developed regions.

3W

In l989 ADC agents tracked and killed 36 cougars; another 5 were killed by ranchers. Of course, the true number of shot lions will never be known.
Wildlife law enforcement officers project that the illegal/unreported kill may be another 50% of the annual harvest. Ranchers are being compensated

by tax dollars for every loss; why then kill the cougars? l

OTHER FASCINATING FUBBEABERS

 

 

For years the Utah Wilderness Association has monitored the trapping activities reported in DWR' s annual furbearer book. The official body count
for l989- l990 follows: 3436 beavers; 1115 mink, 850 bobcat; 3600 foxes; 366 badger; 1300 skunks; 2464 raccoons; 122 ringtailed cats; 17, 000 musk-
rats; 33 weasels; and 3330 coyotes (plus another 5000 killed by ADC). It is the reclusive nature and the decreasing population of pine marten that
bring the species once again to the concern of UWA and all interested In wildlife.

 

PINE MARTEN

 

 

The pine marten (Manes ameﬁgana) is considered one of the most beautiful furbearers and is closely related to the famed Siberian sable. It is about
the size of a housecat and contains a visible throat patch which helps distinguish it from its larger cousin, the fisher. Because of its beautiful coat, the
fact it is a climax/old growth species and a carnivore, its continued survival is tenuous. Indeed, it is referred to as a Wilderness-dependent” species.

Pine marten in Utah were originally found throughout the Wasatch Range and Plateau, the Uinta Mountains and the LaSals. Today, they are only
likely found in the High Uintas—their status elsewhere In the state is unconfirmed. Any backcountry traveler knows what a rare experience it is to catch
the fleeting glimpse of a pine marten.

Pine marten thrive best In dense conifer stands and are not knoWn to venture more than a few hundred feet into open terrain during the winter. In
the Uintas and Other similar northern/central Rocky Mountain ecosystems, they do well in old and mature lodgepole pine stands interspersed with wet
spruce bogs.

Research has shown that martens are greatly harmed by extensive logging and development. They are also easily trapped. Because they are an
old growth species, biologists consider the pine marten an excellent barometer of natural forest ecosystems. The Wasatch-Cache National Forest has
listed the pine marten as a Management Indicator Species (MIS), meaning it is indicative of and dependent on specific habitats. Thus, consideration of
this species and its survival is supposed to play an important role in forest management decisions.

Martens mate in the middle of the summer, but implantation is delayed, as it is in some other members of the weasel family, and the young are born
in the spring. The young, usually three, are raised exclusiVely by their mother and mature rapidly. Territories for males average about one square mile
and overlap that of several females, whose territories are about one-quarterthe size of males’ territories. Research being done by the Utah Division of
Wildlife Resources (UDWR) in Naturalist Basin (the west end of the High Uintas Wilderness) shows about 1.67 martens per square kilometer.

Ironically, Utah still allows pine marten trapping even though this species is sensitive and used as a management indicator. By trapping a

Kenai Peninsula Lynx Population

In Danger

By Stephen Wells

Once again, the combined
mismanagement of the U.S. Fish &
Wildlife Service (FWS). and the Alaska
Department of Fish Sc Game
(ADF&G) has caused a drastic decline
in the population of another one of
Alaska‘s most magnificent creatures ~-
this time, the lynx.

The F\\’S knows why numbers are low,
but then, they knew that the population
was being ravaged live years ago, and
refused to listen to their own biologists
and prevent this decline. A good
example of this is the management
fiasco which occurred when, in 1985, a
team of FWS biologists warned that the
lynx population on the Kenai National
Wildlife Refuge (KNWR) was being
"oxv‘erexploited" by "an intense, persistent
and prolonged harvest that exceeded
the capacity of the lymr population to
compensate for natural and human
mortality...". Despite this and other
warnings, FWS management officials
caved in to pressure from a few local
trappers and the ADF&G, refusing to
close the refuge and causing more lynx
to be killed.

Finally, FWS closed Game
Management Unit (GMU) 15A in the
northern part of the refuge to lynx
' trapping, and reduced the trapping
season from 126 to 47 days in the other
two GMU’s on the refuge, 15B and
15C. The closure of one unit and not
the Othershowever, only caused trappers

percentage dropped from 43% (’83-84),
to 37% (’84-85), to 21% (’85-86). The
Alaska Wildlife Alliance believes that
this method is objectionable because: 1)
Lynx kittens are far more likely to be
trapped than adults, and 2) it is simply
misguided science to assume that
because many of a given animal are

killed, many more must remain. Due

to -these findings, FWS biologists
recommended that the ’86~87 trapping
season not be opened because "Lynx
are being removed almost twice as fast
as they are being added to the
population."

A further recommendation submit‘ed
by the KNWR staff on Octoberi‘ﬂ,
1986 and obtained by the Alliance
through a Freedom of Information Act
request stated: "Data collected this
summer and over the past four years on
the Kenai NWR indicates that 1)
Refuge snowshoe hare populations [the
primary food of lymt in Alaska] are
declining"; 2) Lynx productivity and
densities are declining in GMU 15B; 3)
Lynx habitat remains unoccupied in
GMU 158; 4) Some resident lynx in
GMU 158 are beginning to abandon
traditionally used areas probably in
search of areas of more abundant prey;
5) Recruitment into the GMU 15B lynx
population may be declining; and 6)
Mortality is probably exceeding
recruitment of lynx into GMU 158."

It continued, "Because of these factors
and in the best interests of the refuge

wise in managing the refuge’s
resources...".
i'With these recommendations from its

own staff, and the only available

-', scientific data pointing to a rapid
decline in lynx numbers, it should be a

foregone conclusion that the season was

kglosed. It wasn‘t. The season opened

as scheduled on December 15, 1986,
and stayed open for 28 days, until the
FWS ﬁnally, issued an emergency
closure. During those 28 days, 23 more
lynx were sacriﬁced to bungling
mismanagement.

The Alliance was instrumental in
bringing pressure to bear on the FWS
to close the season early that year, and
in maintaining the pressure to close the
remaining Kenai Peninsula GMU’s and
to keep them closed. All of the Kenai
Peninsula was closed before the ’86-87
season opened, and has remained
closed since then.

Unfortunately, the lynx population has
yet to recover in numbers on

the Kenai, and the outlook is not
encouraging. It is pathetic that the
agency entrusted with the responsibility
of managing our National Wildlife
Refuges for the beneﬁt of aﬂ

. Americans can be so easily swayed by
t, the special interests of a few individuals
l‘(in this case trappers), and the narrow-
:minded management goals of the
iADF&G.

We must remember, and more

 

January - Eebruary, 1991:

Three Convicted
of Illegal Aerial
Wolf Hunting

Ronald Peltola, Harold Aloysius and
Louie Kinegak, residents of Bethel and
Holy Cross, Alaska, were convicted of
illegal aerial wolf hunting last year in
western Alaska, approximately 350
miles northwest of Anchorage. Alaska
State Troopers found five fresh killsites
and were able to track Peltola’s
airplane by the ski tracks it left in the
snow. Back at Peltola’s hunting camp, ‘.
Troopers found 15 wolf hides; holes in
the backs of the hides indicated that the
wolves had been shot from the air.
None of the men had a permit to aerial .
hunt wolves.

Peltola received a sentence of ten days
in jail and a $1,000 ﬁne. His shotgun
and airplane were forfeited to the State "'
of Alaska and he is prohibited from
hunting wolves or operating an aircraft
for three years.

Aloysius and Kinegak admitted to being
"gunners" in Peltola’s aircraft, shooting
wolves from the flying aircraft, and each
received suspended sentences with two

years probation.

V

In addition to the illegal wolf huntin
charges, Peltola appeared in cour
facing counts of unlawfully an.

So in effect, FWS shifted. the problem
from one GMU to another. This
naturally resulted in the same problems
developing on the rest of the refuge.
This was evidenced by the percentage
of kittens in the kill of,’l'ynx in GMU
158. The percentage (ifi'ikittens in the
kill in a given area is used by biologists
as a gauge of the health of the lynx
population in that area. The

The recommendation concluded, "If

be seriously impacted. Such a delay in

that are prosecuted and convicted (or
plead guilty to a lesser offense to avoid
ajury trial) receive light lines and often .
get suspended sentences. Professional
guides, caught conductingfillegaluhunts,
have had their guiding: privileges only
temporarily revoked. And huuters who
violate the law usually lose their hunting
privileges for only one or two years.

Those who repeatedly abuse hunting
privileges should be permanently
prohibited from hunting. And guides
who do not conduct their business
lawfully should have their guiding
licenses permanently revoked. Doctors

would be barred from practice for

are permanently denied hunting and

By Richard Fleming

THE WASHINGTON TIMES

 

NAIROBI, Kenya —- A paleontolo-
gist once famed for digging up hu-
man remains has'turned his hand to
creating them, commanding a para-
military force in a war against ele-
phant poachers.

When Richard Leakey, a world-
renowned expert on human prehis—
tory, took the job of Kenya’s wildlife
director 20 months ago, he yewed to
save the lives of his animals by end-
ing those of their human predators.

“It is my hope that within the next
few weeks the press will not ask per-
mission to film dead elephants but
dead poachers,” Mr. Leakey said at
the time.

Since then, the bones of dead
poachers testify that he has kept his
promise. - .-

Mr. Leakey directed a small war
that killed more than 50 poachers in
the first six months alone. He organ—
ized a revitalized anti—poaching
force of 300 men, armed with 300
NATO-issue G-3 automatic carbines,
100,000 rounds of ammunition, plus
a license, as he puts it, to “get on and
fight.”

Forget the rhino’s horn, the ele-
phant’s charge, or the black light-
ning of the buffalo. What scares to—
day’s poachers are the ‘ “men in
green” —— the crack troops of Mr.
Leakey’s anti-poaching squad in his
Kenya Wildlife Service.

KWS is a state within a state. Mr.
Leakey can shoot people, has his own
intelligence service and money to
spend on it, and can prosecute whom
he likes. His kingdom is vast. The
Tsavo game park alone is the size of
Connecticut.

“My success,” Mr. Leakey states
flatly, “had to do with the fact that I
had an» international posture. I had
never expected to be director of
wildlife. But the country in 1989
needed a high-profile person who
would stand up to it.” .

As a result of his ruthless zeal, for
the first time in decades Kenya’s ele-
phant population is tentatively fore-
cast to grow over the next 10 years.

That is extraordinary. In 1988, the
:country was losing two to three ele—
phants a day to unstoppable poach-
ers armed with AK-47 assault rifles,
and the savannahs and the forests
Stank with the smell of dead meat.

By April 1989, things were so bad,
he says, that there were more dead
elephants than live to be seen in the
great game parks. The government
decided to take drastic action.

 

“And that action was in essence to
ask me to take it over,” Mr. Leakey
says, and smiles disarmingly. He
leans back in his chair in the modest
office that is his headquarters in
Nairobi, and a hint of steel shows
through the charm.

With the weight of Kenyan Pres-
ident Daniel arap Moi behind him,
Mr. Leakey set out to attack the prob-
lem on two fronts: first, to lower the
price of ivory, and second, to stop the
poaching.

Ivory was fetching $140 a pound.
“It was getting like the drugs trade,
and the profits were just too great
for one to really be able to tackle it,”
Mr. Leakey says.

Kenya lobbied hard for an end to
the trade, set a highly publicized ex-
ample by burning confiscated ivory
and was rewarded in October 1989

by a decision‘from the Convention on .

International Trade in Endangered

Species (CITES) to ban ivory sales.
Ivory prices tumbled. They’re

now less than $25 a pound and the.

local Kenya market is down to about”

a dollar.

His greatest fear now is that 4-
CITES -— under pressure from"

southern African states that have
big elephant populations and want,
not surprisingly, to sell their culled
ivory -— will partially lift its ban in
two years time and spark the
poaching again. .

“And we’ll lose the elephant. W
can’t afford to fight that war. We’ll go-
bankrupt,” he says.

But, meanwhile, animals are a
“resource,” says Mr. Leakey, whose
parents, Louis and Mary Leakey,

were pioneers in the study of prehis- .

toric man.

It is a business that Mr.- Leakey

intends to expand.

From a 1985 budget of $8 million;

he has gone to a 1990 figure of $18
million. Under a five-year plan ex-
pected out any day, Mr. Leakey hopes

his budget will be $35 million to $45

million by 1995.

Prices will go up, prices will vary
from park to park and even within
parks, leases on lodges and camps
will be renegotiated, trusts will be
set up abroad and “we’re going to
improve the marketability of our
product.”

"Ibday, the Kenya Wildlife Service
has time to think of other things im-

possible three years ago, things like ’1
elephant contraception, making se-
, __rious money from tourists and even

reintroducing hunting.

Richard Leakey appears with Dilbena. an lndian elephant, while
campaigning in London last February against sales of ivory in Hong Kong.

Mr. Leakey is considering licens-
ing hunters who want to shoot ante-
lope, zebra, even lion. He is not emo-
tional on the subject. ' . .

“If we have to eliminate 3O lions a
year on the perimeter of Tsavo,
would it not make sense to have
someone do it for us and make
$100,000 instead of losing it?” he
asks.

Kenya loses about that sum in cat-
tle killed by marauding cats.

ONE of the Prince of Wales’s
favourite wildemesses. part of
a unique delta and flood plain
in the Kalahari desert where
he communed with nature, is
in danger ofbeing turned into
desert by developers.

Conservationists fear that
plans ‘ by the Botswana
government to extract water
to supply one of the world’s
largest diamond mines will
ruin the Okavango delta,
known as the “Jewel of the
Kalahari” and regarded as one
of the natural wonders of the
world. Contractors have al-
ready moved into the delta to
start work next month dredg-
ing a 25-mile channel.

Water will be diverted from
the swamps to the Orapa dia~
mond mine 250 miles away.
De Beers, the diamond corn-
pany which jointly owns
Orapa with the government,
admits that the mine’s exist-

 

ing subterranean water sup—
plies would last indeﬁnitely.

The prince spent several
days in the delta on a private
visit six years ago, observing
the natural habitat of such
species as the African wild
dog, the red lechwe antelope
and the wattled crane.
Buckingham Palace said the
prince was unaware of the
developers’ plans. “He has
been extremely interested in
this area over the last few
years.” a spokesman said. “He
is not aware of the latest
developments, but I am sure
he will be concerned to find
out.”

Sir Laurens van der Post,
the prince’s friend and men—
tor, who accompanied him on
a later trip to the region, and a
world authority on the Kala-
hari, is said to be “amazed” at
the project.

Conservationists are con-
sidering a worldwide cam-
paign aimed at saving the
delta. The environmental
group Greenpeace may launch

a drive entitled “Drain..-
are for Death” to draw atten—
tion to the destruction it be-
lieves the project could cause.

The most fervent oppo-
sition to the plan is at Maun, a
frontier-style town which is
the last staging post for trips to
the delta. The mood there is
one of anger and frustration,
with conservationists furious
at the perceived secrecy sur-
rounding the scheme.

The project involves widen-
ing the Boro river, which car-
ries waters from the swamp
southwards to Maun, and
capturing its ﬂoodwater be-
hind a series of earthworks. It
will then be diverted through
another river to the diamond
mine. At present, the overflow
nurtures a ﬂood plain either
side of the river which sus-
tains the abundant wildlife in
the heart of the desert.

The fear is that the project
could upset the area’s fragile
ecosystem. Any interference
with the swamps could, it is
feared. eventually turn the
delta to desert.

Dr Karen Ross, an ecologist
in Maun, who worked on a
three-part BBC series on Bo-
tswana, said last week: “The
delta’s ecosystem is very frag-
ile, and the effects of interfer-
ing with the Boro simply
aren’t known.”

Conservationists believe
other options, such as tapping
the Okavango river before it
enters the delta. and channel-
ling a small proportion south
by pipeline. or building dams,
would be less harmful to the
enVironment.

Tour operators, who bring
30,000 tourists to the delta
each year, are equally con-
cerned about the impact. The
visitors. many British, stay at
reed-built camps and view the
bird and animal life from
wooden canoes.

Making waves: plans to divert water from the Okavango delta,

in the heart of the Kalahari desert. to a diamond mine

250 miles away, could destroy a unique 'wildemess

The controversy over the

scheme prompted De Beers to
claim that any attempt to link
the diamond industry with the
development was inaccurate,
and the government is also
trying to play down the im-
portance of the project. It
claims the aim is to meet the
water needs of Maun and
surrounding villages and help
agriculture.

Among some conserva-
tionists outside Botswana,
however, there is the growing
conviction that the real pur-
pose is to dry out part of the
delta to provide grazing land.

They believe Botswana‘s
cattle barons. a cabal which

includes most senior govern-
ment ministers, have already
allowed much of the country
to turn to desert in pursuit of
the high price paid for beef by
the European Community.

The waters of the Okavango
delta, and the land surround-
ing it, are now too enticing to-
ignore. Although foreign eam-
ings from domestic herds are
only marginally above those
from tourism. it is from cattle
that the wealthiest men in the
country make their money.
Against such odds, the fear is
that the present scheme is the
beginning of the end for the
Okavango delta.

One might wonder if porcupines risk impalement on
their own coats of armor, and indeed they do. Yet each
quill is coated with a natural antibiotic to prevent
infection. Quills also provide buoyancy for the animal
as it fords waterways to travel and feed on aquatic
plants.

Some predators have overcome the creature’s for-
midable defenses, including mountain lions, bobcats
and wolverines. But ﬁshers are possibly its most
successful enemy. Being low slung like its prey. the
ﬁsher specializes in attacking the porcupine’s unpro-
tected face. -

The ﬁsher, itself a threatened creature. has been

introduced into several states to control porcupine

populations blamed for killing valuable timber.

Porcupines are mammals belonging to the rodent
order, ‘yet their closest relatives are South American

Dear Friends,

Happy New Year! And what a year it has been for the .
animals and Peninsula Humane Society. I would like to share "
withgou the progress we have made to end Pet Over-
_ pop ation in our county. Undoubtedly, you have seen, read. _ _ g
and heard of our innovative campaign and the landmark ‘ ' “’ "
-. ordinance. ‘-_. 4 ~_ .. ,0 I. . ,_ t .- ; ~ , ,

I would like to take this opportunity tore-cap all that has
happened and what is to come. I hope this will answer any
questions you may have regarding our campaign.

Much is yet to be done, but with your continued support
1991 will bring a strong re-birth of care and compassion for
animals. It will bring an end to the killing of so many cats and
dogs, not only in San Mateo county but across the country! It
will unite animal lovers to work on solutions.

~;~;;-s::+~5-~:; , Peninsula Humane Society is excited about all that 1991
g Will bring- from the arrival of our new Executive Director,
Leon Nielsen, to expanding and offering quality services to the
animals and citizens of our community. Thank you for your
past and present support. Together, we will make a difference
in the lives of our animal friends.

If you would like any further information in a particular
~ area, or have questions about the ordinance or PHS programs,
please call Tricia Gallegos, Director of Development at
340-7022, ext. 327.

Sincerely

porters as possible, we used several of our mailing lists.

Q.

 

Do these photos shock you? Do they
make you angry? They should. Animal
shelters in King County—not counting
Seattle—killed over 16,500 dogs and cats last year. Nearly all were
healthy, friendly animals who would have made wonderful companions.
Half were puppies and kittens. One-fourth of the dogs were purebreds.
What can we do? It’s simple. By cutting down on the number of

animals born each year, we can cut down on the number of animals killed.

Is death
the best
we have
to offer
man’s best
fﬁends?

King County Councilmember Ron Sims has introduced an ordinance to
lower the death toll. It would establish a six-month breeding moratorium.
After that time, county residents could purchase special licenses if they wished
to breed their animals. Otherwise, spaying and neutering would be required.
This ordinance would help make every puppy or kitten born in King County
wanted.

Many breeders, pet stores, and veterinarians oppose the ordinance. It’ s
unnecessary, they say. It’ s unfair. It’ s extreme. Try telling that to Buster and
Tiffany—and every other animal who will be killed this year.

A ccording to Ron Sims, ”In King County we don’t have an animal welfare
POliCy. We have an animal destruction policy.”

 

I 5 death the best we have to offer man’s best friends? Please, say no. And
write the King County Council, in care of Councilmember Ron Sims, to say ya

to an ordinance that will save thousands of lives. I




Your letter can help stop the
number one krller of cats and dogs.

 

Special interest groups have organized to ﬁght Councilmember Sims’

1. ordinance. They have money, they have determination, and they have their

 

own interests at heart. If your heart goes out to the animals, please help.

 

letters of support for ordinance #335 are urgently needed. Your own
letter—just a couple of sentences—will have the most impact. Simply
. express your support for the King County breeding ban ordinance. If you
don’t have time to write,

Fimag‘SOWS, satisfaction of helping
conservation

 

In the past twenty five years the Society has made a significant contribution of more than
$1,000,000. We have exerted an influence through funding research projects; through supplying
vehicles, planes and equipment for anti—poaching measures; and through helping education and

wildlife awareness.

We have many influential people
acting as Trustees and members of
our Council; and we have District
Representatives in many countries.
All this means that the Society can
hold effective, private discussions at
the highest level and is thus able to
meet potential problems of
conservation quietly and effectively
without rushing into abrasive public
controversies.

Every new enrolment will give us
more muscle in our negotiations with
the Governments. international
agencies and organisations who
control East Africa's wildlife; and
every new subscription will help by
increasing our funds, which are used
to assist conservation in vital ways.
We also welcome firms, organisations
and generous individuals as Corporate
Members and offer them our new
seven point benefit scheme. Please
tick the box for details.

SWARA makes an ideal present to
your relatives and friends—for
Christmas, birthdays or special
occasions. Please tick the coupon for

more forms.

Act now and
help us continue

our vital work.

Effective

communication and
public rela_tlons for
wildllfe parks

by MK. arap Rotich, Executive Director, EAWLS

In theory, the warden of a national park or reserve could go it alone and
‘ protect his closed area from all unnatural disturbances and threats. Although such a
y policy might be one way to protect an ecosystem, it is unlikely to win public support.
‘ and without public support no park or reserve is secure in the long term. Ultimately
the management of wildlife resources is for people and must be undertaken in a
social framework. The survival of a protected area depends heavily on the attitudes
‘, of the local people, and public support at both the local and national level is a critical
’ component of management. A vital part of any wildlife manager’s job is to justify to
higher authorities and to the wider public the existence of the protected area. the
management policies chosen, and the expenditure incurred in applying such

management.

Land and water for reserves will only be gazetted if decision—makers understand
the ecological and economic needs for protected areas and the genuine benefits
arising from them. Government agencies and their administrators are usually more
concerned with balance of payments than balance of nature. It is up to the
conservation community to stimulate their interest and encourage them to promote
the beneﬁts of conservation.

In the short term, it may well be enough to convince the leaders of a countrv that
the establishment of a park, reserve or forest would be a good thing. The official
simply orders it and it is so. But what about the successor? And what about the
general public? How long will they accept the status quo‘? As preserves for land

increase, protected areas will not survive intact unless the re

are appreciated by the whole community.

The East African republics have large and expanding human populations,

putting increasing pressure on land and natural resources. There is need to elicit
public support for wildlife conservation and their habitats. The ﬁrst task is to assess
the levels of awareness and attitudes towards wildlife conservation among the
people bordering the parks, reserves and forests. The rest of the public should also
be assessed and reasons found for whatever stands they hold.

Urban people, upon whom the inﬂuences of a depleted or an optimum

wilderness are subtle and indirect, are often indifferent to wildlife conservation.
Since most dec1510n-makers and professionals emerge from this group, lack of
concem cripples the support needed for wildlife conservation and their habitats.

The outlook of rural people is determined by the degree of their dependence

upon forests for pasture, ﬁrewood, timber and other products. Many communities
bordering the parks and reserves sustain themselves by eroding marginal land and
depleting forest pastures. Their precarious existence may be threatened by enforce-
ment of restrictions in wildlife areas - parks and reserves —— and this can trigger
antagonism towards protected areas.

The younger generation, both urban and rural, must be viewed as a separate

group. Their concern for wildlife will remain largely undeveloped unless they are
exposed to conservation education and interpretation at the appropriate age, and
made aware of its values and signiﬁcance.

To achieve long-term support for a protected area programme and to encourage

real appreciation of individual parks and reserves, it is vital to gain widespread
support at all levels of public and institutional sectors.

The language, degree of detail, focus and the channel of communication will

vary accordingly to the target audience. For instance, it is quite meaningless to quote
the scientific names of rare species to land-hungry farmers, and counter—productive
to bore busy ministers with inessential details.

The message must be tailored to ﬁt the audience. This is an important job, re-

quiring professional communicators. At ground level, the managers of any reserve
cannot escape involvement in the communications ﬁeld. They must develop their
capacities in this direction, even though they are probably trained for quite different
abilities. It is the managers who select the information to be presented, and it is they
and their staff who have the immediate contact with visitors to the park or reserve
and with the neighbouring communities. (Adapted from ‘Managing Protected
Areas in the Tropics’, IUCN & UNEP 1986).

Wild dogs in the
Masai Mara

by Karl Ammann

After an absence of several years a pack of Wild dogs has once again established itself in the Aitong area

At a meeting with a group of Maasai in early
1986 the conversation turned to wildlife: two of
the Maasai elders from the Aitong area
reported that they were regularly seeing a pack
of wild dogs near the Aitong road between
their bomas and the wheat ﬁelds.

Wild, or hunting, dogs had virtually dis-
appeared ﬁom the Mara and the surrounding
areas after 1982, when a small pack of two and
three dogs occasionally ventured as far as the
Musiara area. We were therefore very keen to
establish the accuracy of these reports and to
set up a camp and search for these elusive
predators.

During February 1986 we spent several
days in the area on two separate occasions,
scanning the plains fom hilltops and ridges.
The dogs hunt either at night or during the
early morning or sunset hours. When they are
hunting the plains game react to their presence
at considerable distances, scattering in great
waves.

Our search was futile: there were large
concentrations of plains game, but very few
predators. Once we had decided that they
were not in the vicinity of Aitong we chartered
a plane and started a search by air. Since packs
have ranges of up to 1,600 square miles we
searched large areas extending from the park
boundaries to the Lemek area and the foothills
of the Loitas, but again there was no sign of
dogs.

We returned in early March for another
stint in the area and on the second morning
spotted fast-moving herds to the south of
Aitong hill. We investigated and found a pack:
two adult looking females, an older looking
male and six very dark, youngish males, which
we assumed to be adult offspring of the older
animals. We kept track of them for three days
and watched them hunt mainly young
wildebeest, sometimes covering several miles
during the course of a hunt.

In May we were back and were lucky once
more. The pack was roaming the same area

of the Masai Mara National Reserve.

and we were able to establish the patterns of
dominance within the male grouping and
between the two females.

When we returned in early July we again
searched for several days before some Maasai
herdsmen led us to the pack only 50 yards from
our camp! One of the younger males was
missing, but the eight remaining animals
appeared ﬁt and the dominant female looked
pregnant.

Our next visit to the area was several weeks
later in mid-August. We presumed that the
dominant female would have given birth so we
were now looking for a den with puppies. This
would make the task of relocating the animals
easier as the puppies would be too young to
move away from the den.

The Maasai again found the den for us in a
stretch of dense forest near the Mara River,
and only 50 yards from a fence bordering the
wheat ﬁelds. Observing the dogs was difﬁcult
although they seemed to be quite tolerant of
our presence as long as we kept about 50 yards
away. Through our binoculars we counted
eight very tiny pups, and also learnt that
another of the younger males had disappeared.

A week later the dogs were still using the
same den but it was now very apparent that the
subordinate female was pregnant as well.
Based on research work done in the Serengeti
we thought it was likely that the dominant
female would kill the litter of the subordinate
mother, possibly to give her own offspring a

 

A Swiss national with a degree in hotel management
from Cornell, Karl Ammann has long had an interest in
natural history and photography. He and his wife lived
in the Masai Mara from 1980—82 and have stayed in close
touch with the area ever since. His book on the Cheetah
was published in 1984 and another. The Hunters and the
Hunted, is due out next year.

In trying to combine his professional interest with his
hobbies, Karl conceived and built a small luxury camp in
the Mara, which has undertaken possibly to ﬁnance a
wild dog breeding and reintroduction programme.

 

 

 

better chance of survival. There was also going
to be a gap of several weeks between the two
litters, which would force the pack to remain in
the area much longer if they were to wait until
the younger group was ready to start a
nomadic life (this normally happens when they
are between two and three months old).

At the end of August the second female
gave birth to nine pups. When we returned
during the ﬁrst days of September the old den
was empty and the Maasai were again
instrumental in helping us locate the new den,
which was in a clearing in the same forest some
800 yards away. We were at first surprised at
the herdsmen’s knowledge of the forest, but as
we became more familiar with the area 'we
soon discovered the reason for it: we found
two heavy steel snares with two zebras still
trapped alive in them. We wondered if the old
male might also have become a victim of this
poaching. Although we searched the forest,
there was no sign of him.

That evening the pack killed two impalas,
but the remaining ungulates were now very
aware of the dogs‘ presence and their ﬂight dis-
tance seemed to have drastically increased. On
26 September there were still only six adult
dogs and the den was now approachable by
car. Watching the youngsters at play and inter-
acting with the adults was a delight; they
showed a very different side of their character
from that of the merciless killer.

On 28 September the pack was resting near
the den. It was a cool afternoon and the pups
emerged at 5 pm to play among the adults.
Soon one or two of the fully grown animals
began playfully to mob one of the youngsters,
pinning it on its back to the ground with a lot of
whimpering and excited chirping. AS the
P13y€r8 got more excited they moved further
and further from the den. When they reached
a nearby track one of the males resolutely
started trotting out to the plain. Some of the
Older YOUngSters immediately followed. We
expected the mothers to recall their cubs and

take them back to the den. But the front dog,
which had obviously taken on the leadership
role in the absence of the old male, kept
trotting deterrninedly due west and towards
part of the main goupings of migrating wilde-
beest near the Mara River Camp airstrip and
the Musiara area.

While the older cubs had no difﬁculty in
following, some of the smaller youngsters
started to lag behind. From time to time the
two females would stay behind with some of
the stragglers. Around 5.45 pm they reached a
rocky area with relatively high grass where
some of the small cubs lost sight of the adults.
They would start yapping and one of the
females would return to show them the way. It
was, though, just a question of time until some
were left behind. We had a hard time following
in the car and tried to keep sight of the last, and
Obviously the weakest, of the youngsters. It
suddenly stopped and called and nobody
returned. Through our binoculars we saw the
tails of some of the adults waving above the
h‘gh grass at a considerable distance. If the
male were to press on with the move and
decide to go back to a nomadic life, staying
With the wildebeest herd, it would probably
mean the end of all the nine younger cubs.

We found them again two days later near
the main road and the Mara River Camp
airstrip. There were now 14 cubs in a new den,
In. an area where there was still a lot of
Wlldebeest activity. The pack had travelled 13

to get to their new den and obviously two
more of the smaller cubs had not been able to
keep up and had been left behind. By mid-

 

Karl Ammann

October the pack consisted of 17 dogs with the
12 surviving youngsters now mobile enough to
follow the pack without the need for a den.
When we relocated them in March this
year the 12 youngsters and ﬁve adults looked in
such good health that it was very difﬁcult to tell
the two generations apart. In late June we
received two reports indicating that three
additional dogs had joined the pack. With the
imminent arrival once more of the migrating
wildebeest from the Serengeti the food supply
should be adequate to sustain a 20-member
pack and it will be interesting to see if both
females will again be allowed to raise their own

litters.

A plea for information

Wild dogs are difﬁcult animals to study
because of their wide-ranging habits.
Researchers at Tanzania’s Serengeti
Wildlife Research Centre, the National
Museums of Kenya and the Wildlife
Section of the Veterinary Research
Laboratories plan to radio—collar
individuals to monitor pack health and
movements; oollaring has already started in
the Serengeti.

Considerable information is still
urgently needed on the whereabouts and
sizes of the different packs in Tanzania and
Kenya. Readers who have sighted wild
dogs since 1985 are requested to send
information detailing date, location and
pack size to John Fanshawe, PO. Box
41190, Nairobi, who, with Dr Pieter Kat,
Curator of Genetics at NMK, is compiling
distributional data in preparation for a
major conservation effort against the major
canine diseases, genetic studies to deter-
mine levels of pack interrelatedness and,
where necessary, translocation of
threatened packs.

Your sightings can greatly help this
work.

Lovebirds

at Lake Naivasha

by Jeremy Thompson

Would it be Wise to call fora campaign to capture and export hybrid lovebirds ﬁ'om Lake Naivasha, Where these
introduced birds destroy maize crops and threaten to oust indigenous bird species?

Among the most common birds to be seen in
the fever tree forest surrounding Lake
Naivasha are hybrid lovebirds. In some areas
of the lake, these birds are so vocal and
abundant that a blind person would be
forgiven for thinking they were the only species
present. Twenty—five or thirty years ago,
however, no lovebirds were living in the wild at
Naivasha. Released by private aviary owners,
they have increased their numbers to a present
day population of 6,000 birds. Hybrid
lovebirds have also become established in
other parts of Kenya including Nairobi, Meru,
Embu, Timau, Nakuru, Molo, Kisumu and
the Kenyan coast, and their range extension
continues today. What accounts for the
lovebird’s success then, and what are the
implications of their introduction to Lake
Naivasha. and Kenya as a whole?

This charming and colourful group of birds
became known as lovebirds because they
regularly indulge in mutual preening and form
life—long pairs. While only found in Africa and
Madagascar, the genus Agapornis represents
an interesting example of relatively recent
evolutionary change and adaptation. The red—
headed lovebird (A. pullaria), for example, is
remarkable for its habit of nesting in arboreal
ants’ nests, although most lovebirds nest in tree
cavities. Some other lovebird forms do not
carry nesting material in their beak, but tuck
leaves and twigs in amongst their body
feathers. Some will use their leg to scratch their
head over the wing, while others will scratch
under, and so on.

By and large though, the nine lovebird
forms are extremely closely related and some
are not even completely differentiated as
distinct species. It is, therefore, believed that
they originated from a common ancestor
Which arrived in Africa relatively recently,
perhaps in the Miocene period some 20 million
years ago. Due to this recent genetic origin,
some of the lovebird forms are able to breed
and hybridise with each other in captivity. In
the wild though, this never happens since their
ranges do not overlap.

Four of the lovebird forms, A. ﬁscheri, A.
personata, A. lilianae, and A. nigrigenzls, are

particularly closely related and are considered
by some systematists to be subspecies of the
same species. A. ﬁscheri and A. personata are
endemic to Tanzania while A. lilianae and A
nigrigem's are from Southern Africa. These
four forms all have a ring of white skin around
their eyes distinguishing them from the other
lovebird forms. They also carry nesting
material in their beaks, which is generally con-
sidered more behaviourally advanced. From
this, and other behavioural evidence, the four
white—eye—ringed forms are considered the
most recently evolved of the nine forms and
therefore the most evolutionarily advanced of
all the Agapornids. It is the hybrid of two of
these forms (A. ﬁscheri x A. personata) which
has been introduced to Kenya.

Perhaps the reason for the success of
lovebirds at Naivasha is the agricultural nature
of the habitat, and the presence of irrigation
and maize. Lovebirds have been intimately
associated with agriculture throughout their

range in Africa, and their status as a cereal pest
has been noted many times. At Naivasha, they
are basically a seed—eating bird and consume
acacia seeds complemented with a mixture of
grass seeds and cereal crops. Usually, the
presence of these food items is dependant on
regular seasonal events such as rainfall. At
Naivasha, however, the presence of irrigation
means that these foods occur somewhat
randomly and with less pronounced seasonal
peaks in abundance. This is reflected in the
breeding behaviour of the Naivasha lovebirds,
as they are capable of breeding in any month of
the year.

The success of lovebirds within Kenya as a
whole may be due to their hybrid nature. It is
well known that the mixture of two different
sets of genes in a hybrid bestows upon it
increased variability, allowing it to cope with a
much wider range of environmental cir—
cumstances than either of the pure forms.
In Tanzania, Fischer’s and masked lovebirds
have a very restricted range. Hybrids in Kenya
though, are now widespread and have been
reported from sea level up to nearly 3,000
metres.

Lovebirds are perfectly adapted to feeding
on maize: their very strong hooked bills are
capable of removing a maize ear‘s outer sheath
with the efficiency of a can opener. Weavers
are another important maize pest at Naivasha
but they are much slower at exposing the maize
kernels and must wait patiently in turn for the
lovebirds to peel back the outer sheath before
they can use their longer beaks to penetrate
deeply inside the ear. In fact, an interesting
reversal of dominance occurs in maize ﬁelds.
In the forest, lovebirds are usually a very timid
species. When feeding on maize though, they
are in command, and will easily drive away
other species. Presumably this is a behavioural
adaptation which has quickly been learned by
the lovebirds and other avian maize pests to
allow a faster exploitation of the food resource.

In large commercial ﬁelds which are
adequately protected by bird scarers and which
are too large for the relatively few birds to have
a signiﬁcant impact, damage levels may be
negligible. Also, since much of the maize at

Naivasha is intended for cattle fodder, it is cut
at an immature stage before being vulnerable
to attack by birds. On smaller shambas or plots
though, where maize is grown on a part-time
basis to supplement farm-workers’ income, the
damage can be serious. Here, lovebirds and
other species are quite capable of consuming
30 or 40 per cent of the maize, leaving some
ears completely stripped. Furthermore, once
the maize’s outer sheath is removed by birds
additional maize is lost to insects and fungal
infections. Even partially opened ears with
minor damage can reduce a crop’s marketable
value by as much as 50 per cent. Although
lovebirds are not the only pest of maize at
Naivasha, their ability to quickly open maize
ears has disproportionately increased damage
levels by other birds.

Another concerning aspect of the
lovebird’s introduction to Naivasha is their
effect on other hole—nesting birds. At
Naivasha these include grey, Nubian,
bearded, and cardinal woodpeckers, green
wood hoopoes, lilac-breasted rollers, superb
starlings, blue-eared and Riippell’s long-tailed
glossy starlings, white-bellied tits, red-fronted
barbets, woodland kingﬁshers, red-throated
wrynecks, pearl-spotted owlets, and grey
hombills. Lovebirds are indiscriminate cavity
nesters and are known to have occupied and
probably bred in the nests of other species such
as weavers and swifts, as well as in the nesting
holes of barbets. Woodpeckers may be
particularly susceptible to competition from
lovebirds because their ﬂedglings need to be
able to use several alternate holes to reduce the

Naivasha are holes originally made by WOOd'
peckers, and this has probably had an effect on
woodpecker densities. The cardinal wood-
pecker, for example, is the smallest of the
Naivasha woodpeckers and IS surprtSlngly
uncommon. Barbets are also rarely seen in the
lake’s woodland and may also have been
adversely affected by the introduction 0f
lovebirds. The densities of many other hole-
nesting species may have declined but,
unfortunately, no data are available on their
numbers prior to the introduction of lovebirds
to the lake area.

Lovebirds are not an aggressive species; in
fact, at Naivasha they are often attacked by
other species. However, their lack of
aggression is adequately compensated for by
their increased mobbing activity. If threatened
by a predator or nest competitor, they will
muster the support of other individuals by their
loud alarm calls. One bird lover at the lake
even claims that a pair of lilac-breasted rollers
which had regularly bred in a backyard tree
had been forced to leave because of the sheer
numbers of lovebirds harrassing them.
Although a very aggressive species, lilac-
breasted rollers are shy at the nest and will
desert easily.

Lovebirds are also capable of nest
usurpation by more indirect methods. For
example, I have seen lovebirds bringing acacia
twigs to a green wood hoopoe’s nest, which the
hoopoe would have to remove on its return to
roost. Similar behaviour has been observed in
the South American tityras. Tityras success-
fully oust woodpeckers by ﬁlling their holes
with debris so that the woodpeckers eventually
tire of removing it and abandon the nests.
Furthermore, lovebirds, unlike many other
hole-nesters, permanently occupy their various
cavities throughout the year and substantially
modify the cavities by weaving neat entrance
tunnels with leaves and twigs. A single hole or
cavity may be used by several species for
breeding over a season or seasons, so the
permanent occupation of a hole by lovebirds
prevents its use for breeding by any other
birds.

If, then, lovebirds are considered a pest in
Kenya, what, if anything, should be done
about them? The benefits of a pest control
campaign need to be weighed against the costs.
These may be evaluated by using either
economic factors, more intangible criteria, or
both. A control programme would have the
beneﬁt of removing a maize pest and a bird
which competes for nest sites with indigenous
bird species. However, the thought of a
lovebird eradication campaign is repulsive, and
the ﬁnancial cost greater than government
agencies may be willng to pay for the relatively
minor economic beneﬁts.

There remains the option of allowing
lovebirds to be exported and sold as caged pets
overseas, thereby defraying the costs involved
in their control.Agapomids have had a long
history of capture for the caged—pet industry, a
practice which has been spurred by their
reputation as a pest of Cereal crops. For
example, in 1929, approximately 16,000 black-
cheeked lovebirds (Anigrigeng) were
captured over just a four-week period in
Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and sold to

the Union of South Africa for 16s.6d. a pair!
An export campaign from Kenya would
harmlessly reduce lovebird numbers while
paying for itself. Indeed, it could be quite
lucrative and would provide a source of
valuable foreign exchange for Kenya. How-
ever, the exporters concerned (government or
private) would quickly reach a point where the
numbers caught would not justify the
greater time and cost involved in attempting to
trap an increasingly uncommon bird. Those
afraid of seeing the demise of such a beautiful
bird in Kenya can therefore be assured that it
is unlikely that a campaign would ever be 100
per cent successful. The sale of lovebirds within
Kenya should not be allowed. however, as this
would eventually lead to their further range
extension within the country. They have
already established themselves in other parts of
Kenya partly as a result of their notorious skill
as cage escapees.

The reputation some bird exporters have
earned themselves in the past must be weighed
against the preceding arguments. I have heard
disturbing stories of large numbers of birds
dying in transit as a result of negligence and the
callous attitude of the exporters. The method
of collection is also important since it is likely
that untrained bird catchers would un—
intentionally also catch other specics in their
traps. Only careful surveillance and a profes-
sional attitude by the exporters will prevent
this from happening.

The long-term effect of a control campaign
must also be considered. Perhaps the export of
lovebirds in large numbers would encourage
the international trade in birds and increase the
demand for other. already endangered species.
On the other hand. an export campaign could
take pressure off other countries from which
lovebirds are already being exported.
Indigenous lovebirds are being indiscrimin-
ately exported from Tanzania. for example,
and may even be endangered in parts of their
natal range such as the Serengeti. Certainly,
the export of lovebirds from Kenya should not
be regarded as a precedent to justify the export
of other species which are not pests or com—
petitors with indigenous bird species.

Part of Kenya‘s national heritage is its
enormous variety of birds and anything which
threatens their existence must be taken
seriously. The introduction of Indian house
crows and house sparrows on the Kenya coast
has already seriously harmed the local avifauna
there (see Swam, January/February 1987).
Now, introduced lovebirds threaten th€
survival of other bird species. There is no easy
solution to the problem and the authorities Will
have to carefully weigh the costs of any export
campaign against the benefits of their removal.
I sometimes wonder what a blind person Wlll
hear at Naivasha in a further twenty years.

Raising a baby rhino

by Daphne Sheldrick

 

 

The numbers of black rhino living in
the Wild in Kenya has dropped from
20,000in 1970 to between 400 and 600
today. Based on her many years of
experience, the author describes how
it is possible to hand rear an orphaned
or abandoned rhino li'om birth — a
practice that could have an important
role to play in Kenyan
conservationists’ struggle to save our
rhino ﬁ'om extinction.

When my husband David and I left Tsavo East 1
..... , National Park, where he had been warden for

' - i . V 28 years, we came to Nairobi National Park
where David was taking up an appointment
with the new Planning Unit of the Wildlife
Conservation and Management Department. I
thought that this surely marked the closing
chapter of my long and intimate involvement
with wild orphans, particularly animals such as
elephants, rhinos and buffaloes. With a heavy
heart I bade farewell to my erstwhile animal
family, all now well grown, well adapted and
well able to lead a normal wild life without me.
Now the bonds between them and me were
purely emotional. They returned from time to
time simply because they loved me, and once I
was no longer there, I knew that they would be
free of their human ties.

Nostalgically I looked back on my
experiences with animals; to the successes and
the failures, the heartaches, the challenges and
the rewards. Over the years I had raised four
rhinos, one from the day it was born, 22
buffaloes, a dozen or more elephants (but
always only those who were over one year
old), two zebras, most species of antelope,
ostriches, mongooses, civets and others. I had
learnt a lot from them and had been able to
evolve suitable milk formulas for most species.
Ww/ M Now I thought my work in this ﬁeld had been

baby rhino

Three months later, having just settled into
our Nairobi National Park house, David died
from a sudden heart attack. At that moment I
felt that life for me had ended, and certame
my involvement with animals would be a thing
of the past. Leading a life without him was a
daunting prospect, but slowly I healed and got
on with it, helped by the solace of Nature
afforded me by being allowed to continue
living in the Nairobi National Park. I tamed the
wild animals that lived around my house and
made them my friends, so that I could enjoy
their company. They replaced my erstwhile
orphan family, and gave me their trust and
their love.

Raising baby rhinos, and indeed most wild
animals, is easy when you know how, and not
easy if you do not. Following the death of an
orphaned rhino calf in the Nairobi Animal
Orphanage it was suggested that any future
orphaned rhinos should be under my personal
supervision, and it was proposed that a small
orphan complex be built near my house in the
Nairobi National Park.

The ﬁrst inmate was Sam, the baby rhino
who was born to the famous Halima, one of
two rhinos that survive near Governor’s Camp
in the Masai Mara National Reserve. Halima
had had several previous calves, but all had

been taken by lions. Not only is she a very .

docile cow, but the lions in that particular area
consort in large prides, and no rhino can hope
to protect her baby against a determined
onslaught by a pride of killers.

~ Since the Mara rhinos are kept under
protective surveillance, the fact that Sam .was
on the way was well known ,r’a'nd indeed his! A
future was the subject of debate at several
Rhino Steering Committee meetings. Finally it
was decided that rather than remove him at
birth he should be protected in situ by a team of
rangers specially assigned for this task. For
three weeks after his birth these rangers kept
the lions at bay, but one dark night they
attacked. The rangers and Halima managed to
drive them off on this occasion, and Sam was
saved.

However, it was only a matter of. time
before it happened again, so the erdhfe
Department decided to move mother and
baby to a safer location where they could be
protected more easily. Halima was darted and
drugged, Sam overpowered and captured 1n
the process demonstrating amazrng courage
for one so small and ﬁghting with all the fury
for which his kind is known. The relocation
was successful in that both mother and baby
survived the ordeal, but unsuccessful in that
Halima, being by nature a territorial animal,
was bent on getting back home. She took to
swimming the river to do exploratory sorties,
leaving Sam, who refused to follow, behind.
Being left alone he was of course very dis-
tressed, and very vocal, and hearing his wails,
the lions swam across the river from the other
side. Had it not been for the quick action of the
Wildlife Department rangers camped close by,
he would undoubtedly have been killed.
Instead, the rangers were able to drive the lions
off, and he was rescued in the nick of time, but
in a critical condition with deep lion bites in his
neck and back and scratches all over his body.
He was then just six weeks old, and it was in
that condition that he was brought to me on 6
October 1986. He needed a friend and
constant companion to instil a feeling of
security, so we acquired Boozie, a fat-tailed
Dorper type sheep of local origin. Sam and
Boozie are inseperable and even sleep
together.

Being mother to a wild animal is un-
doubtedly a most enlightening and rewarding
experience, but it is not always as simple as it
might appear. It is not just a question of ﬁnding
the correct milk formula, shoving a bottle into
the animal’s mouth, slotting the animal into a

if human routine, and devoting to it only the

time one can spare now and then. In order to
be successful one must be a mother in more
than just name. One must be wholly com-
mitted, understand certain truths about
animals in general, and be totally sincere in
one’s love. for an animal can gauge such
things with an uncanny accuracy. What one is
prepared to put into the relationship will be
the measure of what one will reap in return.
No matter what your experience, never

presume to know all the answers, because you
never will. Humility is a valuable prerequisite
for being a successful foster mother.

The ﬁrst basic fact one must understand is
that, like people, each animal is an individual
in its own right, with its own unique tempera-
ment, and its own special idiosyncracies.
Forget any worries about being labelled
anthropomorphic. Such scientiﬁc dogmas are
not only being proved outdated, but they
shutter an ability to probe the mind of an
animal. Anyone who subscribes to this
philosophy will never be able to penetrate the
barrier that isolates human from animal, for
absent from their makeup will be some of the
vital ingredients for opening the door to
conﬁdence, sympathy, compassion and an
ability to project oneself beyond human
ignorance and arrogance. This, I suppose, is
what is meant by the term ‘an empathy for
animals’. An empathy for animals is a must.

One should understand that animals are
‘different’ from ourselves — not inferior.
Therefore one should never gauge their
intelligence by human standards. They are
endowed with mysterious ‘senses’ that we have
either lost, or never had. Whereas we com-
municate by the power of speech and the
written word, animals communicate no less
effectively by much more subtle means: by
telepathy, by ritual, by scent, by body language
and by instinct, that inborn ‘memory’ inherited
over aeons of evolution that is the blueprint
that dictates certain actions, survival tactics and
aspects of social behaviour. So, it is necessary
to understand that animals are not always
masters of themselves; that instinct might
intervene at any moment.

However, although raised by a human, it
has been my experience that most wild animals
know exactly what they are. They know what
and what not to eat, what and what not to fear,
where and where not to venture. But, instinct
is something that needs honing by exposure to
a wild situation, and it is vital to understand this
simple truth when raising a wild animal. Don’t
mete out ‘smother—love’. Don’t shelter the
animal too much. As it grows up, it must be
allowed freedom and the space to venture into
its own world in its own time; to be actually ex-
posed to all that world harbours; to hear and
understand the language of the birds; to
explore the events of_yesterday on the grasses
and scent trails; to interpret the different
messages borne on the wind; to learn who its
enemies are.

Never assume that a wild animal belongs to
you, or is a pet. Regard it as only being ‘on
loan’ and be happy that you have been
privileged to share its life until it responds to
the call of the wild and takes its rightful place
amongst the natural order. You must learn to
say ‘goodbye’, and very often, if one can do
this, a goodbye turns into an ‘au revoir’. The
animal will remember you with affection, and
return periodically to re-establish contact.
Never conﬁne a wild animal for selﬁsh reasons.
This is unforgiveable, and if one cannot oﬂer 1t
some form of freedom and a near natural life,
it is better not to raise it in the ﬁrst place. '

It is also important to know the socral
characteristics of your charge. Is it, for instance
gregarious or one of Nature’s loners? Does it
seek seclusion and solitude when young, or 15
the constant companionship of others a basic

 

 




 

 

need for its psychological well-being? An
animal’s psychological well-being is equally
important as its physical, so one must try and
simulate what it takes to give the baby a sense
of security. If it lies out during infancy, for
instance, provide the necessary cover to enable
it to feel hidden. Understand animal codes of
behaviour too; what are aggressive actions and
what are subservient signals. Above all, know
that all animals have very long and unforgiving
memories. One must respect this, for an
unkindness or cruelty will be remembered, and
perhaps a grudge harboured until an opport-
unity presents itself to get even. Remember
that animals have feelings and emotions, likes
and dislikes. Like us, they sorrow and are
happy, they have loved ones, and deep
loyalties too.

Rhino babies are, strangely enough, one of
the easiest and most uncomplicated of wild
infants, and perhaps also one of the easiest to
rear when one knows how. However, rhinos
are delicate in many respects, and when
subjected to any kind of trauma, tend to go
down to pneumonia and the tick- and ﬂy—bome
diseases normally latent in their blood. Even a
very young rhino will ﬁght and charge its
captors with all the aggression for which its
species has been labelled, and if this happens,
be warned that within about four days of
capture, the baby will become very ill, even
though it has settled down and tamed easily.

Therefore, upon capture, dose the animal
immediately with one of the sulphur based
drugs, and forestall babesia and
trypanosomiasis with injectable Berenil.
Guard against pneumonia by keeping the
animal warm, if necessary by tying a small
blanket around its body at night and during
the cool morning and evening hours.

Rhino babies are very endearing. They
quickly lose the head-heavy infant look and,
but for a blunt nose and soft smooth skin,
become perfect miniatures of an adult, sturdy
and rounded. At birth a rhino only stands
between 18 and 25 inches at the shoulder, and
weighs between 60 and 90 pounds. Rhinos

 

tame more quickly and easily than any other
animal. Even an adult can be tamed within
only a few days. They slot into a routine with
philosophical ease, being very much creatures
of habit. They love a comfortable rut, and are
content with less than most other orphans:
their food on time; a dry warm stable at night;
a mudwallow and sandpit at their disposal; a
patch of bush in which to hide; and a ‘friend’.
Never do they shove or jostle for the bottle, as
does a buffalo, but ask with a plaintive mew,
and gently take whatever is offered. They need
a companion close by at all times, to replace
the mother that would have been a part of their
early life. And they thrive best wandering free
with a human attendant and an animal com-
panion, romping and playing, investigating
the scents and sounds of the bush. All this
avoids the danger of boredom; another
important aspect in the raising of young
animals.

As I write Sam is ten months old and
already I ﬁnd that I have learnt a lot more
about rhinos. Being a mother to a wild animal
opens the door to a special and intimate under-
standing of animals, one that is totally fascin-
ating and rewarding.

 

Daphne Sheldrick was born and educated in Kenya
and for well over 20 years lived in Tsavo East National
Park where her husband David was the warden. During
her years in Tsavo she successfully reared and re-
habilitated numerous wild animals.

Daphne has written four popular books about her
experiences in Tsavo, many educational articles on
wildlife, including several for Swara, and a piece on
elephants for Colliers Encyclopaedia. She now immerses
herself in the work of the David Sheldrick Wildlife
Appeal, which was set up in memory of her husband. In
recognition of her work she has been made an honorary
warden, an honorary life member of the Game Rangers’
Association, a patron of Zoo Check and the Rhino
Rescue Appeal, an executive committee member of
the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya and a member of the
Wildlife Conservation and Management Department’s
steering committee for the Kenya govemment’s rhino
projects.

 

 

 

 

 

How to feed
a baby rhino

A ‘humanised’ brand of baby milk with a
full cream base is the key to raising a rhino.
I have always used Lactogen, and on the
following formula have raised four baby
rhinos without any difﬁculty whatsoever,
one from the day it was born (still in the
foetal sac).

Feed four hourly during the day at 6
am, 10 am, 2 pm, and 6 pm, and, until the
calf is a month old, once at night at 10 pm.

The initial ratio should be 8 scoops
Lactogen to 24 ﬂ 02 water. Gauge amounts
according to demand. All baby animals
know what they want and when they have
had enough. After a few days, increase the
ratio to 10 scoops Lactogen to 24 ﬂ oz
water, and aim for 1 scoop per 2 ﬂ oz. This
is the full strength ratio, and the milk base
will be mixed according to this for the entire
time the calf is on milk, which is usually
about 18 months.

Having achieved the full strength ratio
for the milk, one then introduces the cereal.
Start by adding 1 tablespoon of Nestum
baby cereal and 1 tablespoon Energex
wheat germ two times a day, then three
times a day, and ﬁnally to all feeds.

At about four months each feed will be:

4% pints warm water
7 oz Lactogen powder
(7 02 = 45 scoops)
5 tablespoons Nestum cereal
2 tablespoons Energex
1 tablespoon glucose
Pinch of salt.
At ﬁve months each feed will be:
5% pints water
9 oz Lactogen
9 tablespoons Nestum cereal
1 tablespoon glucose
Pinch of salt.

The calf will very soon begin to browse
a little, and at this time it can go on to milk
feeds per day. The cereal can also be
changed to uncooked oatmeal, and the calf
will now have:

6 pints water

10% oz Lactogen

11 oz oatmeal (15 tablespoons)

4 tablespoons Energex

Salt.
This is the maximum milk feed. As the
calf browses more, it will be noticed that its
appetite for milk declines, and its lunch-
time feed can be dropped.

The calf will probably go off its food
whilst teething. Don’t be hasty to give
drugs. Mix milk according to demand.
Always allow some ticks, but not too many.
It is important that the calf acquires an
immunity to tick-bome diseases, and the
way to do this is to allow it to have some
ticks on it.

Feeding, and the quantities to give, is
really a matter of common sense. A lot of
cereal and a lot of Vitamin B is essential to
the good health of a rhino calf. On the
above formula, the calf will gain about 1
kilo per day.

Mikumi National Park

 

The road from Morogoro to Mikumi begins
between two mountains: the broken-backed
Mindu on the right, and the sharp—toothed
Ulugurus on the left holding back the heaviest
clouds.

It was a day of animals.

Long before we entered the boundaries of
the national park, several black snakes slipped
and undulated across our path, disappearing
like water under our bonnet, to be seen again,
intact, pulling themselves effortlessly into the
side of the road.

A ram desperately herded his goats into a
cluster and on to the grass verge, bounding
sharply back to butt a young kid, who tried to
match and meet with our speed.

Massive grey boulders moving towards us,
and forcing us to swerve, changed into a ﬁle of
elephants as we approached.

Dare-devil baboons ran alongside our
speeding windows begging for food.

Above us, an eagle pressed air, spanning
the warm winds. Daily he attempted to lift
himself away from the earth.

In the dusk, the lodge road was peppered
with smashed balls of elephant dung, and ﬁfty
yards to the right of the entrance, under an
acacia tree, a towering silhouette ﬂapped its
ears like giant butterﬂy wings.

The lodge, a bold and imaginative
structure of dark wood and glass, was superbly
situated on a prominent hill, 1,000 feet above
sea level. Its rooms overlooking a water-hole at
the bottom of a green bowl, which sloped up
into wooded folds. To the west lay the ﬂood
plains of the Mkata River.

Inside the building, past the white ﬂower-

‘ ing tree whose sweet smell pervaded the

entrance, a feeling of space and light
dominated the entire structure. The natural
environment was all important, and the dining
room allowed cinema-screen views of animals
feasting and basking, while guests munched
alongside.

‘Mikumi’ is the Kiswahili name for the
doum (or borassus) palm, which dots the
savannah plain and produces fruits that are a
favourite with elephants. In many cases,
elephants co-operate with the agile, scavenging
baboons and depend on them to toss down
fruits that are inaccessible.

. The old Mikumi village has always been
Situated on the edge of the park, but the village
Of Kikoboga (after the name of its chief) was in
the centre, and during the park’s formation
had to be resited. Its people were moved
twenty miles south to the present New Mikumi
Vlllage, but the old name is kept alive. The
largest suite in the hotel is named ‘Kikoboga’,
In memory.

It was June when we visited. A time when

literally (as in the song from Oklahoma) ‘as
high as an elephant’s eye’. But, it was difﬁcult
not to see animals. The park is 3,247
kilometres square; the third largest after
Ruaha and Serengeti.

‘Poaching is rampant and very difﬁcult to
stem,’ according to the park warden, who
provided us with innumerable statistics (for
example there are 370 species of recorded
birds in the park). The poachers, acting for a
business-organiser, use home-made muzzle
loaders, riﬂes, poison spears and arrows, but
most commonly snares, to trap game for meat
and commercial profit. Rhino horn fetches up
to $900 per kilo in North Yemen and the tusks
of over ﬁfty elephants daily enter Hong Kong
alone, albeit legally. One compensation is, that
the sale in leopard skins is slowly dropping. It is
no longer fashionable for women to wear
leopard-skin coats.

It was not necessary _to actually go out into
the park, for just in the panorama covered by
the bedroom window, there was a daily parade
of animals at the water—hole: two hippos
ponderously surfaced now and then, pushing
out pink periscope nostrils to question for
intruders; a lone waterbuck with regal antlers
collapsed into position in the sunniest spot on
the bank; small groups of watchful zebra, with
tails forever ﬂicking ﬂies, took turns to roll
ﬂeetingly in the dust; stiff—tailed warthog
minced past, like marionettes; and swaying
sticks and stilts that were giraffe, splayed their
legs in an ungainly split to reach the grass.

Keep an eye out for the albino buffalo,
standing like whitewash among the black
grazing herds, or the disputed, solitary
crocodile sleeping in the water-hole, which
very few have seen. We spied them both.

If you are lucky enough to have room 17
you will be bedfellow to the aged buffalo, and
his accompanying ox—pecker, who have set up
home under a tree not twenty yards below the

window.

Near the swimming pool, wrinkled and
almost bald marabou storks stride pains—
takingly, like bowed, frock-coated old men.
Arms behind their backs, liver spotted, the
weight of the world’s problems peering
through their knowing eyes.

We watched a baboon, balancing a
banana, scamper from behind the kitchen. He
loped lightly away, with self-conﬁdent swag—
ger, to mingle with the marabou. Preening
themselves with sure strokes of their pterodac—
tyl bills, they kept old-mens’ eyes alert and
moved a few stiff steps away, obviously dis—
trusting him.

And Moses, the Mikumi elephant, was the
star attraction.

Always alone, in the tall reeds, Moses daily
inscribed a circular tour in the grass. His grey

bulk appeared from the left, and by lunchtime
had slowly ambled to the water-hole. At 4.30
pm, pulling and crunching idly at grass clumps,
he was at the back of the lodge, just below the
kitchen area.

Close to 7 pm, Moses always left the stage,
plodding up the bank and on to the dirt road.
The horizon glowing, blotting up a slow-
spreading orange from the sun. The hills and
trees becoming cardboard cut-outs and Moses,

A record of giraffe homosexual behaviour

 

 

On 5 March 1987, in the Masai Mara National
Reserve, two adult male giraffe (Giraﬂe
camelopardalis tippelskirchi) of similar size
were observed in prolonged homosexual
behaviour. These giraffe were in scattered tree
grassland and located 1.5 km south of the Mara
River along the road connecting the Mara
Serena and Keekorok lodges.

Data were fortuitously collected by
researchers who were positioned in vehicles
35—50 m from the giraffe. The observers were
members of a team concurrently studying
giraffe on the Athi Plains, Kenya.

Sex was established by observing a scrotum
and penile button for both individuals. These
males were part of a herd consisting of ﬁve
adult males, ﬁve adult females, one subadult
female and two unknown individuals.

Behaviour preceding the recorded
homosexuality was not observed. During an
80—minute period (3.15 - 4.35 pm), 35 mounts
were recorded; with the average mount lasting
1.2 seconds and an average inter-mount period
of 133.5 seconds.

When ﬁrst seen, the males were facing the
same direction, with the chest of male A in
contact with the hindquarters of male B. In all
cases, male A mounted male B. The following
sequence of events was repeatedly observed.
An erection occurred in male A, who shifted
his weight laterally while rubbing his chest
against male B’s hindquarters. Male B
remained stationary during this stage and
ruminated continually. Male A then quickly
mounted male B, positioning his forelegs
above male B’s hindquarters. Ejaculation was
frequently observed. Immediately after
mounting, male A dismounted posteriorly, as
male B stood still or stepped forward. On
several occasions, male A performed a
ﬂehmen—like manoeuvre (behaviour common
to most ungulates when the males test the
females to see if they are in oestrus), lowering

his muzzle to the peri-anal region of male B,
then raising his head, but without curling his
lip. A third nearby adult male observed males
A and B during the entire homosexual
exchange.

Giraffe homosexual behaviour has been
previously recorded by Innis, who studied
populations in the Transvaal. Mejia, who
researched giraffe in the Serengeti, argues that
homosexuality may offer a non-aggressive
alternative to neck ﬁghting in the reinforce-
ment of dominance among male giraffe. Our
observation appears to be unique in document-
ing prolonged mounting between adult male
giraffes, including ejaculation.

CITES meeting

 

 

The UN Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES), which held its
biennial two-week conference in Ottawa in
July, passed a resolution to extend a trading
ban on rhinoceros horns in an attempt to save
the species from extinction. The CITES group
also plans to send a high-level diplomatic

mission to the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Burundi, which are believed to be
perpetuating the illegal trade.

CITES officials said poachers use Burundi
as ‘the warehouse of Africa” and import the
animal from surrounding nations. The horns
are then exported to the UAE and other Asian
countries where they are used to make
ceremonial dagger handles or ground up for
medicinal purposes. The situation for the
rhinoceros is said to be desperate as less than
10,000 of the animals survive in Asia and
Africa.

‘We have to admit in the case of the
rhinoceros we have failed . . . We have not
been able so far to put together a mechanism
which will allow for the cutting of illegal trade
in the rhino horn,’ said Eugene Lapointe,
Secretary General of the 95—country CITES
group.

Asked what would happen if the UAE,
which is pulling out of CITES, and Burundr,
which is not a member, do not accept the
mission, Lapointe replied, ‘We are in trouble.’
Lapointe said the group is considering asking
Britain’s Prince Phillip, active in wildlife
causes, to help plead its cause.

A report presented at the conference
severely criticised several countries for failrng
to enforce the convention, which also regulates
trade in elephant ivory, crocodile skins and a
host of other products made from endangered

Gorillas found in Nigeria

 

Gorillas have been found in Nigeria more than
50 years after conservationists believed they
had become extinct in West Africa. ‘But the
gorillas are under constant threat from hunters
using locally made shot-guns,’ John
Mshelbwala, technical ofﬁcer of the Nigerian
Conservation Foundation told Reuters after an
expedition into the thick jungles of the
Kanyang mountains in south—eastem Nigeria.

Lowland gorillas were known to live in the
impenetrable rain forests of Zaire, Congo, the
Central African Republic and Cameroon,
south-east of Nigeria, and a small number of
mountain gorillas still survive in the dense, wet
forests of the Virunga volcano chain on the
borders between Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda.
But the last time any gorillas had been
reported in West Africa was in 1931.

‘The notion that gorillas exist only up to
Cameroon should be erased . . . not only that,
this population is totally independent of that in
Cameroon because there is no evidence of
migratlon at any time of the year,’ Mshelbwala
said. He said he did not see the gorillas in
Kanyang himself but he had seen their nests.

Gorillas build large nests each day from
foliage and ferns both for resting during the
day and to sleep in at night. By examining and
counting the nests and from other signs experts
can estimate very precisely how many gorillas
there are in a partiCular family and get a good
idea of their ages. Mshelbwala said: ‘We
believe the population of the gorillas is
between 40 and 50 but we need further surveys
to establish accurate numbers.’

He said he had also interviewed some of
the hunters in Kanyang, the only surviving
Virgin rain forest in Nigeria, in Cross River
State. The other forests have been wiped out
by timber merchants trading in African
manogany, a hard wood valued in Europe and
the United States for furniture.

‘Dennis Abang, a hunter in Bamba, said
he had shot eight of these gorillas in the forest
in March 1986 and captured one young one
alive,’ the conservationist said. The animal was
taken to a zoo in Calabar, the state capital,
where the hunter was paid 50 naira (12.50

g),

dollars). It died in the zoo shortly afterwards.

Mshelbwala said the gorillas were in
danger from the hunters. ‘Unless something is
done soon the gorillas will eventually be wiped
out. Hunters have swamped Kanyang. Wire
traps and snares are everywhere and the
guards cannot check these activities because
they have no means to do so,’ he said. ‘They
are shot purely for meat because there are no
farmlands to be destroyed in this jungle. The
people can eat anything that moves, monkeys,
chimpanzees. . . .’

Under a nature conservation decree passed
in 1985, it is illegal to hunt endangered species
and offenders can be ﬁned 1,000 naira (250
dollars) and jailed six months for any sub-
sequent offence without the option of ﬁne.
‘The people in Kanyang don’t even know such
law exists,‘ Mshelbwala said.

The Nigerian Conservation Foundation,
founded in 1982 as a non-government and non-
proﬁt organisation, intends to publicise the law
to save threatened species like the gorillas. In
1984, the foundation launched a massive
campaign to save the white-throated monkey,
a rare species known to occur nowhere else in
the world outside Nigeria.

In the November/December 1986 issue of
Swara a questionnaire was sent to readers in
East Africa requesting information on sightings
of black and white colobus monkeys in Kenya.
Our goal was to obtain a general idea of the
conservation status of black and white colobus
in Kenya as well as information on their current
distribution. Using a questionnaire is valuable
because it is a rapid and inexpensive way to
obtain information, but it must be remembered
that the method is limited in the accuracy and
completeness of the data obtained. We were
pleased by the number of responses and the
readers’ enthusiasm.

The readers of Swara magazine kindly
returned 122 questionnaires which gave
information on black and white colobus in
Kenya. Most questionnaires listed more than
one location where colobus have been sighted,
so I received information on a total of 302
colobus locations. Many of these locations
were reported by more than one reader,
especially those which are in popular tourist
areas such as the Aberdares, Mount Kenya
and Diani Beach.

In response to my query, ‘Do you know of
any area(s) where colobus used to be present,
but are now absent?’ 1 received 45 replies
telling me of areas where colobus have been
greatly reduced or eliminated. A few readers
had information dating back to 1920!

Those areas which seem to have thriving
colobus populations based on the number of
monkeys seen by readers are the Aberdares,
Mount Kenya, Mount Elgon, some estates in
the Nandi Hills area, the stretch between
Kitale and Kapenguria, the southern Chere-
ngani Hills area, Tinderet, Londiani Forest
Reserve, Kakamega Forest and the Kaimosi
area.

Most reports were of recent (1985—7)
sightings. From these data a map was made

23

 




 

 

colobus

which plots the number of reported sightings at
each location (Figure 1). Although this map
probably does not include all areas where
colobus are currently found, I believe it
generally represents the current distribution of
colobus in Kenya. This map closely resembles
the map of black and white colobus distribu-
tion in Kenya found in J. Kingdon’s 1971 book,
East African Mammals Vol. 1.

Using all of the information available to
me, I have listed those locations which should
be surveyed because colobus have dis-
appeared, declined in numbers, or their status
is uncertain (Table 1). Again, this list should
not be considered conclusive.

Many readers who lived near colobus
populations expressed concern over the plight
of colobus since unprotected forested areas are
gradually being destroyed or replaced by non-
indigenous trees such as gum trees. The
problems of the Limuru area are an example of
what colobus are facing in inhabited areas of
Kenya. Colobus exist there in isolated patches
of indigenous forest on large, private land-
owners’ land. The continued survival of the
colobus population in the Limuru/Tigoni area
is questionable Since groups have become
isolated from one another because of dis-
continous habitat. Many of the natural trees
have been, and are being, cut down or
replaced by fast-growing gum trees, which are
unpalatable to colobus and probably many
other animals who rely on trees for food.

As the forests disappear so do the colobus
and many other species of plants and animals.
This serious problem will continue until an
inexpensive fuel is made available to people
who currently rely on wood for all of their
energy needs.

I am grateful to Dr James Else, who
suggested the project, the readers of S wara, Dr
Gerald Muchemi, Ms Diann Eley and Mr
Cunningham-van Someren for their valuable
assistance in this project. (9

When, some years ago, a part of the Ololua
Forest was excised to harbour the Institute of
Primate Research, there was an uproar in con-
servation circles. Being a daily equestrian
visitor to the forest, I was also incensed, and
not only because of the curtailment of my right
of way. Now, half a dozen years later, one can
see what the fencing off has done for the forest:
it has restored it to the condition it was
probably in a generation ago. Whether the
authorities who were involved in the change of
the forest’s status planned it thus, whether or
not they had foreseen it, there is now a section
of Nairobi’s green belt which has been saved
from destruction. It may well be that this
segment will be the only one.

There is a very substantial green belt in and
around Nairobi. Of the forests, the City Park,
Karura, Ngong, Ololua, Embakasi and
Dagoretti forests are the best known. These
forests have recreational and aesthetic value,
but their role in the environment of the city is
far more fundamental: they clean the air and
also serve as water catchment areas. They are
of economic value to the Forest Department.
While consisting to some extent of indigenous
trees, they are also partly planted and, when
harvested, allow for temporary agricultural
use. Their scientiﬁc value can be demonstrated
by the fact that much of what we know about
the crowned hawk eagle and the great sparrow
hawk, for instance, we know because the late
Leslie Brown lived next to the Ololua Forest.
The green belt, such as the Arboretum and the
parks along Uhuru Highway, is more extensive
than are, the forests themselves.

The authorities probably believe in the
value of the green belt and intend to retain the
forests of this green city, so the present threat
to these forests is not a pending change in
policy; rather their increasing destruction is
due to neglect and a sheer lack of foresight.

The destruction of these forests is a
complex environmental phenomenon. Like all
struggles between nature and culture (the
latter being, by deﬁnition, interference with
nature) it is most intense at locations where
rural and urban interests are closely inter-
woven.

The greatest threat to any forest is the
felling of its trees. Trees are being felled in all
these forests, but a more systematic scrutiny
reveals a variety of settings in which this
happens.

Illegal felling is relatively rare and has not
increased substantially over the last decade

The forests of N

by Imre J.P. Loefler

 

 

Nairobi, ‘The Green City in the Sun’,
is in danger of losing her forests
through neglect and a sheer lack of
foresight.

largely because of the alertness of the
foresters; tree cutting is a noisy undertaking
and the foresters, aided by those who have
some legitimate assignment in the forests,
catch many an illegal tree feller. Most of the
illegal felling is in areas where large settlements
abut on to the forest, particularly when the
settlement is semi-rural, like Ongata Rongai
with its extensions along the Kandis River, and
Dagoretti at the edges of the Dagoretti Forest.

Parts of the planted forests are, of course,
harvested. This seems to be a straightforward
operation and presumably takes place along
accepted rules of forestry. In any case, during
the 10-year span of my observations, a
considerable proportion of forest grew again or
was replanted.

Another harvesting scheme is more
ominous and perhaps in need of investigation;
this is the selective felling of an entire stand
of a particular species. In the last three years in
the Ngong Forest, all the African olives have
been cut down.

Finally there is the case of cutting for a
higher good: when a part of the forest has to
yield because planners are reluctant to make
even the slightest detour around trees. This has
happened to the Karura Forest and to the little
forest at the City Park when the water pipeline
was laid.

Forests can also be destroyed without tree
felling. Mutilation of trees is not unusual in all
these areas. Partial debarking to obtain
medicine is common, particularly in the Ngong
Forest near Kibera, as is the cutting of
branches required for domestic use. The
collectors of kuni (ﬁrewood), who have a
licence to gather wood which has been shed or
has fallen, often enough embellish their collec-
tion with a little cutting. The licenced collection
of kum' is ill—supervised and threatens the

undergrowth in the Ngong Forest in particular.

The cutting of undergrth is interfering
with tree regeneration. This can best be
observed in the Embakasi Forest, where.
along the Dagoretti-Ngong road, a narrow
stand of indigenous trees were left; this is now

 

  
    

 

airobi

 

getting more and more sparse because there is ‘1
constant interference with regrowth. '

The greatest damage to indigenous forests i
is done by cattle and goats. They have largely
destroyed the undergrth in the Ololua
Forest and have debarked many sizeable trees. l
Cattle and goats come into the forests in three
circumstances: licensed forest grazing, illegal
grazing, and illegal cattle movements. The
latter is common in the Embakasi Forest,
when herds arrive from the Rift Valley and

await distribution to the many slaughtering
points in Ngong and Dagoretti. The grazing in
forests is altogether detrimental. The driving of
cattle through forests creates phenomenal
erosion, and it changes the pattern of the run-
off substantially.

It is not only cattle, of course, which make
paths. People do so too, and the trafﬁc through
these forests has increased many times; and
not only pedestrian trafﬁc. There are highways
leading through all of them, and there are
numerous tracks which seem to attract many
amateur driving instructors.

There is a peculiar urban variety of threats
to consider next, and this is rubbish. Many
people have taken to depositing rubbish in the
forests, rubbish in huge, one can only say
commercial, quantities. Examination of the
rubbish allows it to be classified into domestic,
industrial and contractors’ waste. The common
denominator is the possession of a commercial
vehicle. Most contractors who build in the
Karen area seem to instruct their drivers to
dump all the debris in the Ngong Forest. Some
industrial plastics are carried a long way from
town and broadcast. Most outrageous, how-
ever, is a recent ﬁnd: dozens of whisky bottles,
all sorts of tin cans from delicatessen items such
as foie gras and salmon, and heaps of old jour-
nals, among them Swara.

The forests, particularly the Ngong and
Ololua Forests, also suffer from a fall in the
water table caused by the diversion of water
from rivers and creeks. The Mbagathi River {5
used as the source of much large-scale, 2111361t
not necessarily legal, irrigation in the area
around Kererapon, and further down in Karen
and Langata many households help themselves
to its water using a variety of pumps and rams.

The fauna in these forests is vaned an
interesting. I know little about invertebrates,
but in some seasons I see dozens of SPCCICS 0
butterﬂies of stunning beauty. I am more
interested in birds and ﬁnd an abundariIt
number of species: not being an expert, I S

managed to assemble a check-list of some 120 species around Ololua.
Apart from the larger raptors, whOse food supply is diminishing and who
do not like constant molestation, there has not been much change over the

years, except that the destruction of undergrth has deprived many of

the sulking little lot of their habitat. In the fenced-in area around the
Institute of Primate Research, there is a great concentration of bird life,
which I am only able to observe through the fence...

The mammalian life of these forests is remarkably varied, bearing
witness to the great ability of many species to coexist with man. The herd
of giraffe in the Ololua seems to hold its own. There are bushbuck in most
places, suni in the Ololua and Ngong (diminishing in numbers for the lack
of undergrowth), duiker, some dikdik, a few warthogs, signs of bush pig
and aardvarks, and sounds of hyrax and bush baby. There are Sykes’
monkeys and vervets, and some baboons. Althoughz'I have found a few
snares, I think the greatest source of harassment for these animals is not
poachers but packs of stray dogs. There is a pack of some ﬁfteen dogs in

the Ngong Forest, and I have seen them hunting many times in the last
two years.

Vandalism hurts game, birds, and plants. The male youth of the sur-
rounding areas practise their skills at stone throwing, catapulting, panga
wielding, and game chasing everywhere. A peculiar form of vandalism is
the cross-country motor-bike events held in the most secluded areas of the
Ngong Forest where, whilst the youth of the afﬂuent city-dwellers terrify
birds and game (and horses), one can see their proud parents waiting at
strategic points — and it is astonishing how many of their cars bear the
stickers of the East African Wild Life Society.

I suggest that the preservation of these forests requires a community
effort. It is futile to wait for the authorities to do something; they are
preoccupied with other things. Perhaps a society needs to be founded,
perhaps existing associations or clubs could exert some effort and make a
plan. Community action always costs time and money; so to attract
support a good programme needs to be put forward. Here are some

‘ suggestions:

— Let us help the Forest Department to put up barriers at the access

' points and man them.

— Let us clean up the forests in a self-help action. Surely a well-
advertised campaign ending in a party with a rafﬂe should get rid Ofall that
jr'mk. ,

— Perhaps if the forest guards were given bicycles they could do the“
jobs better.

— Let us have those stray dogs either caught or shot. If nothing 6156,
the rabies situation should require us to do so!

— Let us spend time and money on education in the schools of the
neighbourhood, and let us create junior omithologist squads; some of
those loitering, stone-throwing, giraffe-chasing boys could become superb
naturalists if only we cared to educate them. .

— Let us see whether the Forest Department would be interested 1n
setting up an honorary forest warden scheme.

— Let us alert the authorities to illegal water use; this is an issue they
are already very concerned about. .

— Eventually many of these forests may need to be fenced 1n; let us
study the problem now.

— Let us try to persuade the organisers of those motoring events not
to vandalise the forests with their noise and exhaust fumes.

- Let us support the foresters.

— Let us protest against the apparently universal idea that trees have

' to yield to water pipes, telephone poles, roads, fences, or even an)I 01d

store room, and that trees have the lowest ranking priority when it corrlﬁS
to development.

Author’s addendum

When I wrote this article some months ago, I only included those threats
to the forests which I had observed myself. Since then, several hectareS 9f
the Indigenous part of the Embakasi Forest have burned down, and It
appears that many large trees will not regenerate. In the same area, that?
18 another threat — one which I did not even imagine: the forest earth 15

I am sure that everyone is for development, but when will SOCIety

realise that forests are so valuable that one should plan to go around
them? 9

SOCIETY

 

Chairman’s speech to the AGM

The following is the text of the Chairman’s
speech given at the annual general meeting of
the East African Wild Life Society in Nairobi on
14 August 1987.

Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure to
present the following report for your inform-
ation, consideration and discussion.

But before we go into the business of
today, I would like to record our sorrow over
the recent death of Professor Bernard
Gzimeck, a key conservationist in East Aﬁica.
Many of you will remember Professor
Gzimeck as the man who did so much for the
establishment and the continued successful
operation of both the Serengeti and N goro-
ngoro National Parks in Tanzania.

At the last annual general meeting, held in
July 1986, it was agreed to change the end of
our ﬁnancial year from 31 December to 31
March. As a result of this change, the ﬁgures
for our accounts for the year 1987 will not be
readily comparable with those of previous
years as they represent a 15-month rather than
a 12-month period.

Despite the difﬁculty of comparison, how-
ever, it must be obvious to all that the Society
has had an excellent performance over the 15
months. You will note that the shop did
extremely well, producing a proﬁt of over
£51,000 against £24,000 for the previous year.

The details of the shop trading are given on
page 3 of the accounts and you will see that the
main factor behind this high proﬁt was the
large volume of sales achieved in 1986/87. On
your behalfI would like to pay special tribute
to Mrs Wangumo, the Shop Manageress, and
to her sales staff.

The membership department is of great
importance to the Society; your subscriptions
support the production of S wara as well as
other administrative expenses. Here you will
again see a major surplus of over £21,000
against a deﬁcit of £3,000 for the previous
year. The grth in both ordinary and corpo-

rate subscriptions is a trend that must be con-
tinued; we must not become complacent.

Members will be happy to see that there
has been a major reduction in costs for Swara
magazine and this has mainly been due to the
savings on postage. The improvement shown
in the accounts reﬂects the fact that two issues
were mailed through the courtesy of Pan
American Airlines, which allowed us to bulk
freight the magazine to the USA for mailing
from there. The enormous personal efforts by

James Webb in the USA has enabled the
Society to save an average of £4,000-£5,000
on postage per issue.

At this juncture, I consider it most appro-
priate to convey the Society’s deepest thanks to
Pan American Airlines. In particular, I would
like to thank Mr C.E. Acker, who is Chairman
and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of Pan American
Airlines in New York, for agreeing to airlift the
magazines to Dallas. I should also like to thank
Mr Jim Dastur, who is the Pan Am Regional
Director for Eastern Africa. He has been very

30

 

 

HIGHLIGHTS

helpful indeed through his Nairobi ofﬁce. Pan
Am are really making an extraordinary con-
tribution to the Society.

At the same time, I would like to thank on
your behalf Mr James Webb, who not oply
played a key role in the negotiations with I an
Am in New York, but who also offered to
redistribute, free of charge. all USA copies of
Swara from his Dallas ofﬁce. That is not an
easy job as it involves not only labelling and
sorting the magazines but also carrying. out
various accounting procedures and liaising
with the US postal authorities and the Society
ofﬁces in Nairobi. All this he is doing for free.
We are fortunate to have Mr James Webb
giving us such invaluable support, so let me
again say avery big thank you to him and his
family.

Looking over the balance sheet you will see
an improvement in the Society’s ﬁnances dur-
ing the current period. Our net current assets
are over £223,000 against £157,000 for the
previous year. You will also note a major build
up of surplus money in the shop fund. I would
like to report that we have again been able to
transfer £25,000 from the shop fund to the
Conservation Fund. This is a very key con-
tribution and is an important reason for
continuing our trading operations.

Unfortunately, we do still have one
problem in that some of the money we show as
current assets is in fact tied up in a ﬁnance
company that has been unable to meet its
obligations to us in full. In 1986, we had
deposited £75,000 with lndo-African
Finance Company and it has proved impossi-
ble to withdraw this in full. Legal assistance
and a wide range of actions have been taken by
Council over the past 12 months and. as of
now, £37,500 of the original deposit remains
to be recovered together with interest due of a
further £20,000. It is inappropriate to give full
detarls here of the steps that the Council has
taken and rs taking at this meeting but I do
want to assure you all that I am conﬁdent that

concerned with anti-poaching. Tyres and tubes
have been purchased for essential anti-
poaching vehicles that had been grounded and
repairs carried out on the rhino capture lorry
itself. We also paid for food to be transported
for the rhinos that have been captured and
translm‘ated to the Ngulia rhino sanctuaryin
'l‘s‘avo West.

Most of the other anti-poaching projects
we supported have been in Meru National
Park. lsiolo and the surrounding areas. You
will be aware that poaching in Meru had been
a major problem. the Society funded special
anti—[matching ojx-rations that have led to the
recovery of over W t elephant tusks in the
Meru area and the recovery of riﬂes. Ihope
you will all agree that this sort of assistance 18
vital and enables the wardens in the ﬁeld t0
keep operations going at times when depart-
mental funds are scarce. Funds have also been
given to the Nakuru Rhino Sanctuary and t0
the expansion of the 'l‘savo Rhino Sanctuary.

Your Society has also supported several
projects being carried out by students at East
African universities. We have also contlnued
to support the Wildlife Clubs 9f. Kenya,
Uganda and 'l‘anzania through provrdmg them
with the necessary funds for their park v131ts,
and seminars for both students and teachers.

submitted to the Society. They have been able
to conduct pilot surveys throughout this
country of areas that have been thought to be
of major importance to the well being of
wildlife. I have only spoken brieﬂy about the
projects we have supported as they have been
described in detail throughout the year in the
‘Society Highlights’ column in Swara.

Membership is the main backbone of our
funds and every effort is being made to
improve on the recruitment of new members.
At present most of our members are not East
African nationals and it would be gratifying to
have more local people participating in
conserving wildlife and the enviromnent. In
this context, I would again appeal for support
of the Society’s activities from wananchi. It is
also my sincere hope that present members will
continue renewing their membership and help
us by recruiting at least one new member to the
Society this year.

Our world—wide representatives played a
big role in enrolling new members and I wish,
on your behalf, to thank them for their good
work. Of particular mention are Mr Johan W.
Elzenga (The Netherlands), Mr Matsuo
Tsukazaki (Japan), Mr Keith Tucker (Califor-
nia, USA), Mr David Keith Jones (Great
Britain), Dr Eric L. Edroma (Uganda), Mr
Suthar Kiran (Meru, Kenya), and Mr Tom
Claytor (Philadelphia, USA). Mr Roger
Mitchell of Papyrus Tours also deserves our
thanks for his continued support of the Society
by enrolling most of his clients as our members.
I would call upon all the representatives to put
more effort into improving our membership
ﬁgures and the Society’s image.

In the 15 months we have received over
£20,000 in donations to speciﬁc and general
projects. Many people and institutions have
given us their cash or material contributions.
Details of major donors have been published in
Swara from time to time, but I would like once
more to thank all our donors, large and small.

Let me now turn my attention to one or
two other issues. For a good many years the
Society used to be criticised for its rather
abrasive stance on local conservation matters
and an effort was made to tone down our
public utterances. The launching of Swara‘
coincided with the new philosophy of working
‘behind the scenes’ to inﬂuence the authorities
and for a while we seemed to have some suc-
cess. In due course, we began to be criticised
again for being ‘passive’ or simply ‘unmoved’
by local issues and some of our friends have
even been heard to ask whether or not the
Society had a view or voice any longer! Most
recently, we have again had a public position
on certain local concerns such as the Mara
shooting incident and, as might be expected,
there has been a mixed reaction; some believed
we were right to speak out while others felt that
we were simply being destructive.

I would like to take this opportunity to
express very clearly our position as I see it and
as I believe the bulk of the membership sees it.
We recognise very well the enormous difﬁcul—
ties faced by the wildlife authorities in East
Aﬁica and the constant conﬂict between
competing interests. There has to be some give
and take on all sides and there has to be some
ﬂexibility. Notwithstanding, we are convinced
that conservation is in everyone’s interest. The
protection of the environment and wildlife is

 

not solely an endeavour for the beneﬁt of
tourists or special interest groups; all stand to
gain. and it is absolutely a matter of national
concern. Conservation is as important as
health, education or agriculture. The
authorities who have the responsibility for
conservation policy and practice are engaged
in very real nation building endeavours and
should at no time allow themselves to be
deﬂected from their objectives. The Society
will continue to seek constructive dialogue with
all concerned but, if it is necessary to speak out
in defence of any principles affecting con-
servation, we will do so.

It is worth noting here that recently private
interests have been in conﬂict with larger
municipal or national interests in two Kenyan
towns, Mombasa and Kisumu. I am informed
that as a result of public outcry, plans have
been abandoned to develop the beauty spots
along Mama Ngina Drive in Mombasa and
Hippo Point in Kisumu. The voices of con-
servationists are beginning to be heard and we
should all take heart from this and continue the
ﬁght.

Before concluding, let me raise one or two
other matters that I hope will gain the attention
of the authorities concerned.

Poaching continues to be a problem and
the lack of operational equipment and
adequate support is a matter of great concern.
Our anti—poaching units are ﬁghting poachers
who have modern ﬁrearms at their disposal so
I would appeal to the governments of our
region to upgrade the ﬁre-power of our wildlife
forces. Brave men are being killed in action
simply because they cannot ﬁght back.

Research is a crucial area and I feel that far
more could be done to upgrade research
facilities and to provide a more scientiﬁc
rationale for conservation policies. We are
being left behind in this area and there are
countless examples of research providing use-
ful solutions to complex problems. We cannot
afford to follow blindly old ways and traditions
in the area of conservation and park manage-
ment.

The over-use of the parks with animal
harassment, cross-country driving and lodge
and hotel development must be seen for what

it is. Unless steps are taken to bring these
pressures under ﬁrm control, it will be a loss for
all. The areas cannot take much more abuse
and I hope that something will be done soon. It
is in nobody’s interest to prevaricate; decisions
have to be taken and implemented before it is
too late.

Returning to the area of research, I am
very concerned by the fact that local scientists
and local institutions are often given less time
and consideration than their colleagues from
abroad. In Kenya, we have some very good
and competent scientists working at excellent
laboratories. Cannot these men and women
be harnessed? It is only when this is done that
real progress will be made.

Let me now conclude my remarks by
expressing our appreciation to several key
people. Recently, Shereen Karmali had time
away from S wara and Genevieve Cameron
took over as Editor on an entirely voluntary
basis. Thank you, Genevieve, for your efforts
and for keeping Swara up to the mark.
Shereen is now back at her post and I think you
will all join me in recording our appreciation to
her and her assistant, Juliah Nguru, for our
magazine’s success. Thank you both. I have
mentioned Esther Wangumo, who runs our
shop, and I again thank her. Other members of
staff have played their role for which we are
surely grateful. I would like to thank members
of Council and members of the Scientiﬁc &
Technical Committee. The Editor of our
African Journal of Ecology, Professor F.I.B.
Kayanja, continues to notch up successes for us
and we are in his debt. The journal made a
proﬁt of over £4,000 last year. Volunteer
Denise Campbell has done more than I can
say, as have individual Council members on
special assignments. Thank you indeed one
and all. Last but by no means least, our
Executive Director, Nehemiah arap Rotich, to
whom we are particularly indebted for his
excellent leadership of the entire organisation.

 

Membership Officer goes to Japan

 

The Society’s Membership Officer, Jeremiah
Munai, made a three—week visit to Japan in

highlights

July at the invitation of the Japan Animal &
Plant Academy (JAPA), which is part of
Japan’s Human-Like Integrated Academies.
The main purpose of his visit was to strengthen
the ties between JAPA and the EAWLS,
which are both organisations working for the
conservation of wildlife and its habitats.
During his Visit, Mr Munai gave lectures to
students and members of the public about the
problems of wildlife conservation and .their
possible remedies, and described the activities
of the Society over the last 30 years. He
managed to raise nearly Ksh 40,000 in
donations and new membership subscriptions.
We would like to express our very sincere
thanks to the Japan Animal & Plant Academy
for making it possible for Mr Munai to visit
Japan and in particular to Mr Matsuo
Tsukazaki, Principal of JAPA and Chief
Executive Ofﬁcer of the Human-Like
Integrated Academics (and also the Society’s
representative in Japan), for his personal
contribution to the success of Mr Munai’s visit.
We also wish to acknowledge the
invaluable contributions of the following: Mr
Peter Orwa, JAPA’s representative in Kenya,
who introduced JAPA and Mr Tsukazaki to
the EAWLS ; Mr N aoki Okamoto, Director of
the Creative Department of the Human-Like
Integrated Academies, who translated Mr
Munai’s speeches into Japanese; Miss Millicent
A. Odero, who arranged his accommodation;
Mr Kawasaki, Mr Hamada and Mr Watanabe
for their guidance on ﬁeld visits; and, ﬁnally, all
the staff of the academies who helped in one
way or another to make the trip a success.

 

Fund for Conservation Endeavour

 

As one of the major goals of the conservation
movement in East Africa is to provide. opport-
unities for local people to enhance their
conservation skills and understanding, several
conservation organisations felt it was appro-
priate to develop a fund to allow people with
ideas to implement small projects.

The Fund for Conservation Endeavour has
been set up by the African Fund for
Endangered Wildlife (AFEW), the African
Wildlife Foundation (AWF), the East African
Wild Life Society (EAWLS), the Frankfurt
Zoological Society (F28) and the World
. Wildlife Fund (WWF). These organisations
are keen to assist government departments,
universities and local NGOs in their efforts to
upgrade the conservation skills of their staff.
They would also like to support East Africans
carrying out ﬁeld research in a conservation
related project and encourage the develop-
ment of existing or proposed research
programmes in ”East African institutions. But,
as importantly, the fund would like to encour-
age conservation activities by people not
necessarily professionally trained.

If you are a citizen of Kenya, Tanzania or
Uganda and can show that you have experi-
ence or interest in conservation, then you will
be eligible to apply. The fund could pay up to
$5,000 in local currency per year for a project,
but will only support a project for two years.
Priority will be given to applications that do not

32

 

include the purchase of a vehicle, although
vehicle operating costs can be included. It wrll
not pay school or college fees. . .

The type of projects the fund Will consider
depends entirely on your ideas and lnltlatlves.
You may wish to develop a prOject asopart of
your work or one you will carry out in your
spare time. As long as it is related to a conser-
vation need in the region and is practicable for
you to do, then the fund will revrew your
application. _ .

An example of the type of prOject which
would be eligible is an interesting study being
carried out by Nathan Gichuki, from the
Department of Zoology, Universrty of
Nairobi, and Cecelia Muringo, who is Curator
of the Department of Ornithology, National
Museums of Kenya. They are concerned about
the inland wetlands of Kenya. Wetlands have
great economic potential and perfonn
important ecological functions so their conser-
vation and proper management is essential.
Birds form a major component of aquatic
ecosystems and their numbers are closely
linked to habitat alterations and so can be used
as a way of gauging habitat degradation.
Crowned cranes are particularly good
indicators of habitat quality and so Gichuki
and Muringo are carrying out crowned crane
censuses throughout Kenya, ﬁnding out the
areas to which young birds disperse and
examining environmental stress factors. All of
this will contribute to the development of a
conservation strategy and management plan
for threatened wetlands and bird species in
Eastern Africa.

This is a large study, which is already being
partially funded by EAWLS and WWF, but
serves as an example of the type of project you
could set up as part of your work. An example
of a smaller scale project was suggested to a
fund representative on a recent trip to the
Kenya coast. It was pointed out how few of the
major hotels gave any information about the
fragility of the coral reefs in the area. Several
years ago EAWLS produced an excellent
poster ‘Save Kenya’s Coral Reefs’, which
explained the importance of the reefs and the

com! ”

 

threats to them by over-exploitation for sea
shells, but few hotels currently display it
Someone living locally With an interestilj
marine conservation could set up a prOject to
reprint the posters and peisonally deliver them
to all the hotels, schools and community halls.
The project could go on to develop local
education programmes to increase the aware-
ness of tourists alld local people about Coral
reefs and how to prevent their further
destruction.

If you have an idea for a project and are
interested in more information write'to the

Donations

 

ﬁ~

Over the last two months the East African
Wildlife Society has received nearly Ksh 30,000
in donations to our (‘onservation Fund. We
are most grateful to everyone for their
generosity. but special mention must be made
of (KG. 'l‘rapnell for his handsome donation of
£500 and all the following, who each gave Ksh
1,000 and over: Jeremiah Tower, David Hume
Kennerley, Mike (‘erre, Russell Chatham,
Jack Mingo. Dick Rutan, Paul Theroux and
Pierre Salinger. who all made their donations
through the Banana Republic Travel and C10-
thing (‘ompany, Doris L. Nelson, P. Greer,
Mrs James N. White. and Dr R. Strehler.

 

Bequest of Winifred B. Doherty

 

The Society would like to record its particular
thanks for a bequest of $400 from the late
Winifred B. Doherty.

A suggestion to travel agents and tour
operators

The Society‘s chief representative in the USA,
Keith Tucker. is in the travel business and has
long felt that all tour companies should pay for
membership of the Society for each cllent they
bring to Kenya or Tanzania. The pI'ICB 0f
membership could easily be absorbed 1ntothe
price of the safari so the cost to tour companles
would be minimal. particularly when com
pared to the benefits it would bring. .

The benefits to the Society are obvrous: we
would gain many new members Whose sub-
scriptions and donations would enable US to
SUpport more conservation projects. For the;
tour operators it would mean that at the end 0
a happy safari their clients would return hOmS
and then every two months thereafter W911]
receive their own copy of Swara to remll1
them of what a marvellous time they had. The
chances are that such people would want to
come back here again. The clients would also ‘
beneﬁt in that they would feel that they were
making a worthwhile contribution to conserVd
ing the wildlife and beautiful habitats they ha
so enjoyed. . ’5

Mr Tucker hopes that many of the SOClety .
members who are in the tour anCl 53m,“

could be sent directly to Nairobi or, for

P O Box 82002, San Diego, CA 92138. Mr
Tucker remits all the funds he receives to the
Society every quarter; not one penny is kept in
the USA for local expenses as there are none.
All we would need to have are the client’s
name and address along with the membership
fee, which is currently $22 a head.

 

New Stanford University chapter

 

A member of the East African Wild Life
Society, Robert Abrams, is a student at Stan-
ford University, not far from San Francisco.
He has decided to support the Society and
conservation in East Africa in his own way by
starting an active chapter in northern Califor-
nia, initially based at the university. What he is
calling the Northern California/Stanford
University Chapter has received monetary
backing from the university to help them to
start up on campus and put on programmes of
interest to both students and faculty members.

At present the students cannot afford to
pay the full $22 for individual membership, so
Mr Abrams is making a charge of $1 per
student. When he has 22 students they will join
as a chapter and will receive one copy of S wara
to be shared by all the members. Given the
wide interest in world ecology and conser-
vation at the university Mr Abrams is hopeful
of attracting many new members who have
never heard of the Society and who will even—
tually become fully ﬂedged members on gradu-
anon.

Anyone wanting to join the chapter or
attend its functions should either write to
Robert Abrams c/o Flo Mo, Alondra 202,
Stanford, CA 94305 or phone him on
415-328-6418.

 

Anti-poaching activities in Meru

 

We have now heard from the Wildlife Conser-
vation and Management Department that as a
result of the Ksh 21 ,000 given by the Society to
help ﬁnance an anti—poaching operation
around Meru National Park (see last issue’s
‘Society Highlights’) three well-known
poachers have been arrested. The poachers
were part of a gang that killed two rangers
from the Isiolo Anti-Poaching Unit last year
and have now been charged with murder.

Cleaning up Lake Nakuru National Park
World Environment Day 1987 was a day of
hard work for a group of students from
Nakuru. Not satisﬁed with merely talking
about conservation, they celebrated the
occasion by implementing one of their ideas —
with money provided by the EAWLS.

Many students take part in educational
activities at the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya
education centre in Lake Nakuru National
Park, but are appalled by the large amount of
rubbish in the park, which is swept down from
the town when there is heavy rain.

Through the Nakuru Wildlife Clubs
Association, a group consisting of over twenty
secondary schools in the area, the suggestion

 

was made that representatives from each
school should form a working group to pick up
the rubbish. Park Warden Mr Barasa was
enthusiastic when he was approached and
agreed to provide the park tractor and trailer
for the project. Large plastic bags were
purchased and the group gathered on the
morning of 5 June.

During the course of the morning 95 large
bags were ﬁlled with tins, pieces of paper, bits
of plastic-and old shoes. As one student said
afterwards, ‘It was hard work and,1 think we
did something useful, but there is still a lot of
rubbish to be collected. We will have to come
again.’

His words proved to be all too true: the
next day it rained again and more unsightly
rubbish was swept down into this world-
famous sanctuary.

 

An ecological study of Kenya’s marine
gastropods

The Society has given Tim McClanahan a
grant of Ksh 40,000 to help ﬁnance a survey he
is doing to compare the abundance, diversity
and size of shells found in Kenya’s marine
parks with those found in unprotected areas.
The survey will indicate whether the
commercially-attractive shells on Kenya’s
coast are in fact receiving sufficient protection
or whether the marine parks and reserves need
to be expanded.

 

 

Mangrove forests

 

The litter produced by mangrove forests forms
the basis of a food chain for commercially
important ﬁsh and crustacea. With the help of
a grant of Ksh 25 ,000 from the Society,
Michael A. Majani is assessing the rates of
litter production and decomposition in the
mangrove forest at Gazi in Kenya.

 

Crowned cranes in Uganda

 

The crowned crane is Uganda’s national bird

Wildlife Club members collecting, rubbish in Nakuru National Park.

 

and is legally protected by the state, but recent
studies have indicated that here, as in many
other countries, their numbers are declining.
To ﬁnd adequate food for themselves and their
young, a pair of crowned cranes must defend a
large wetland territory. For this reason they
have been among the ﬁrst victims of wetland
reclamation. The Society has given Paul
Gumonye-Mafabi Ksh 25,000 to fund a study
of the ecology and status of crowned cranes in
Uganda for, in his words, ‘The crowned crane
is an ideal target species for conservationists
we can save the” cranes we will have saved
entire ecosystem.’

 

The effects of ﬁre on grassland birds

 

The use of ﬁre to control the growth of
vegetation in protected areas is the subject of
some dispute. The Society has given Eve Abe
a grant of Ksh 20,000 to help ﬁnance a study
she is doing on the effects of planned burning
on the grassland birds in Uganda’s Queen
Elizabeth National Park.

 

Algae in Lake Victoria

 

The Society has given David I. Kibaara Ksh
18,000 for a project he is doing to determine
the productivity levels of algae in Lake
Victoria’s Winam Gulf. As algae are a vital
food source for ﬁsh the results of this project
could be used to improve management of ﬁsh
stocks in the lake.

 

Support for orphans

 

The Society recently gave a donation of Ksh
3,660 to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Appeal
towards the support of three unusual baby
orphans — two elephants and a rhino. The
animals are currently being raised by Daphne
Sheldrick at the appeal’s headquarters in
Nairobi National Park. An article about Mrs
Sheldrick’s work with young rhinos appears on
page 15 of this issue of Swara.

mLETTERS

 

,__i

From Dr Tim Caro, Cambridge, England

In my article ‘Tourism: too much of a good
thing?’ (Swara, July/August 1986), I tried to
pull together some of the concerns felt by
many people who have visited East Africa’s
parks, not least the readers of Swara judging
from the numerous letters on this topic.
Visitors perceive there to be two tourist related
problems: harassment of animals and~destruc-
tion of vegetation, although tourist facilities are
also discussed.

It is true that, as yet, we have very little
quantitative information on the ways animals
are. affected by being followed by large
numbers of tour vehicles as noted by Johan
Elzenga (S wara, November/December 1986).
But we have numerous anecdotes now to show
that animals can be affected, as reported by
Lord Forbes and Wilson Aseka (Swara,
January/February 1987). Unfortunately, it is
extremely difﬁcult to show conclusively that
individuals living in tourist areas do have lower
reproductive or survival rates because of
harassment by tourists; there are so many
other factors to take into account.

What the majority of concerned witnesses
to these incidents probably think is ‘if this sort
of event happens every day to this particular
animal, say a leopard or a cheetah, then,
erring on the side of caution, I would guess that
the individual is affected even though I have no
concrete evidence to back it up’. In short,
people concerned about anirnals’ well-being
would agree with the statement that ‘it is quite
possible that persistent tourism is having a
considerable impact on animals’ reproductive
performance and lifespan’ (my article).

Unlike other members of EAWLS, it is a
little sad to see EAWLS ‘representative’
Elzenga throwing caution to the wind (in more
ways than one) when he disagrees with his own
amended version of the above statement,
where the ﬁrst ﬁve words are conveniently
omitted. Moreover, although he is correct in
stating ‘one or two individuals being harassed,
however sad it may be, will hardly endanger the
species’, he may be missing the point again. If
a population of individuals in a national park is
low, as it is for Cheetahs in Amboseli National
Park and the Masai Mara National Reserve
compared to the Serengeti for example, then
tourist harassment of only one or two
individuals (eg breeding females) might indeed
affect the ability of that population to sustain
itself in that area, if harassment did affect their
reproduction. Although the species would not
be in danger, future visitors to the area would
not see the animals in question if the local
population went extinct.

Given the current state of knowledge then
(or lack of it), those embracing the more
cautious approach would argue there is an
urgent need to toughen up the rules for visitors
and tour guides in national parks (Imre
Ioeﬂer, Swara, November/December 1986),
or even limit entry to a smaller number of
vehicles until we know what the effects of

animal harassment are; that is if we want to
reap the ﬁnancial and aesthetic beneﬁts of
wildlife in future years, as commented by
Jurgan Luckmann (Swara J anuary/February
1987).

The second tourist related problem is to
what extent off—road driving damages vegeta-
tion in both the long and short term. Again we
have no hard data on this topic but plenty of
anecdotes. Tracks made by vehicles at known
dates do last as long as several years in some
places, especially if made in the wet season.
Until the experiments are done, management
has to make considered decisions as to the best
rule to improve now and in the immediate
future; for example no vehicles are allowed off
the road within a 16 km radius of Seronera and
no trucks are allowed off roads anywhere in
Serengeti. Managers simply can’t afford to
wait until scientists ‘ﬁrst establish the number
of cars that can be allowed in an area’ as
Elzenga advocates.

Some writers to S wara agreed with my pro-
posal of restricting tourist numbers to certain
wildlife areas in East Africa but disagreed with
increasing park fees (eg Randy Brook, Swara,
J anuary/February 1987). Within limits the
amount of money that people are required to
pay at park gates may not affect the numbers
of visitors very much: Tanzania’s northern
parks are, this season, experiencing huge
increases in the numbers of foreign visitors,
despite gate fees being considerably higher
than those in Kenya. Perhaps they have heard
that certain wildlife areas in Kenya are so full
of tourists, tented camps and lodges, compara-
tively speaking.

This leads to a third issue not covered in my
article or letters in response to it. Regardless of
whether tourists do affect animals’ behaviour
or the vegetation, tourists themselves don’t like
to see networks of tyre tracks, .or up to 20
vehicles around the cats. The problem is there-
fore serious if only from a sociological
standpoint. Tour operators are becoming
increasingly aware of this and tented safaris in
special select campsites, away from lodges and
well out in the bush, are becoming more and
more popular in Tanzanian parks. There is
now serious discussion, in Tanzania at least, to
make these companies pay considerably more
than the present camping fee per person per
day for the privilege of not seeing other
tourists, given that their clients are paying in
the region of $500 per day in foreign exchange!

The issue of tourists affecting the very sites
they come to see is complex but it is being
tackled elsewhere: Venice has restricted the
number of its visitors to 10,000 per day, and no
tourists are now allowed to see the prehistoric
cave paintings at Lasceaux. It is high time those
responsible for East Africa’s heritage areas
also took the issue seriously before it gets
completely out of hand.

 

From Dr Tim Caro, Cambridge, England

In recent correspondence to your magazine, a
number of writers expressed concern that the
matters they discussed in Swara would con-
tribute to the recognition of a problem, or
would be brought to the attention of decision
makers. Although Swara is relatively easy to
obtain in Kenya, it is extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd
in Tanzania, although many of the articles and
issues discussed do directly bear on Tanzania’s,
and also Uganda’s, wildlife as much as on
Kenya’s.

Could the editor please provide its readers
with a complete list of all the wildlife ofﬁcials
receiving Swara free of charge, given that it is
so difﬁcult for many people to ﬁnd the neces-
sary funds to pay for this inﬂuential magazine?

Only if leaders of all wildlife parastatal
organisations, biology departments at univer—
sities, wildlife colleges, and park wardens of
every national park in all three countries
receive each issue of Swara will it ever hope to
play some role in shaping wildlife policy in this
region.

If the list of recipients needs to be
broadened, as I suspect, I for one would be
happy to contribute to the extra cost, as I think
would most subscribers. However, the East
African Wildlife Society’s Conservation Fund
would seem to be a natural source of money
for this important enterprise.

The EAWLS Executive Director replies:

Tim Caro’s suggestion is an excellent idea. For
many years before 1979 we used to give com-
plimentary copies of Swara to all the senior
departmental staff in the Ministry of Tourism
and Wildlife and the Ministry of the Environ-
ment. However, as our costs escalated, we
could no longer afford to do this, so currently
copies of the magazine go only to the ministers,
permanent secretaries and senior directors in
the two ministries. In addition copies of the
African Journal of Ecology are sent free of
charge to 41 wildlife institutions in East Africa.

Nearly ten years on, the Society’s ﬁnancial
position is considerably more healthy. A quick
look at the number of people who should
receive the magazine in Kenya produces a list
of over 160 ofﬁcers, and I am assuming that
there would be similar numbers in Tanzania
and Uganda. Given the net cost of the
magazine and postage we would be talking
about a total cost of around K£3,000 a year,
which we could certainly manage under the
present circumstances.

I am preparing a list of the ofﬁcers in all
three countries who should receive Swara,
and I would be happy to supply this to any
members on request.

COMPACT
FLUORESCENTS: lOW
DRAIN, BIG GAIN

One of the most important
weapons in the war against
wasted electricity is the com-

pact quorescent light bulb.
Unlike long tube-style fluores-

cents, these smaller versions fit
into sockets designed for incan-
descent bulbs and cast a pleas-
ant yellowish light similar to
that of an incandescent. But
they use far less power. One

I 3-watt compact fluorescent
provides as much light as a 60-
watt incandescent bulb. And it
has ten times the lifespan. In
big commercial or industrial
retrofits, where the lights tend to
stay on for extended periods,
the energy savings can be
astounding. Various articles
and newspaper reports over the
past year have reported pay-
back figures that differ consid-
erably — from retrofits estimat-
ed to pay for themselves in
under one year to over three
years. For example, the

Jan/Feb I990 issue of In

Business magazine ran an arti-
cle on Rising Sun Enterprises,
Inc. of Old Snowmass,
Colorado (also home of Rocky
Mountain Institute), a firm that
sells and installs energy-efficient
lighting systems. An installation
done by Rising Sun in a branch
of the Alpine Bank of Basalt,
Colorado illustrates a reason-
able retrofit expectation for a
small commercial job: The total
cost of replacing the incandes-
cent bulbs and fixtures in the
bank was $6,200. Proiected
annual savings in energy costs
and maintenance costs are
$2,I50. Return on investment
will be about 34%, with a pay-
back of just under three years.
The environmental contribution
will be 22,953 pounds of coal
that will not be burned each
year and 597 pounds of sulfur
dioxide that will not be emitted

into the atmosphere. When fig-

ures like these are extrapolated

OVERVIEW

DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT: 0
THE NEw GOSPEL or ELECTRICITY

Electric power utilities throughout North America are undergoing a fundamental
change of mind. For over a century, they have considered it their primary job to meet
the ever-increasing demand for power by building more generating stations and
stringing more transmission lines. But because the production of electricity has seri—
ous environmental consequences, a growing number of utilities now regard the effi—
cient use of energy as their first responsibility. Instead of simply meeting demand,
they are attempting to manage it, transforming themselves, as Amory Lovins of the
Rocky Mountain Institute puts it, from ”kilowatt hour sellers” to ”energy-service
providers.” It is a radical shift in philosophy.

Their techniques — collectively known as ”demand-side management” or
DSM —— are aimed at improving the efficiency and timing of electricity use among
customers, thus easing demand on the existing power supply and reducing the need
for future capacity. DSM programs often include the installation of more efficient
lighting systems in office buildings, the sale of efficient appliances to homeowners,
the recovery of waste heat in factories, industrial motor tune-up progran’zs, and direct
control by the utility via computer of electricity—intensive equipment like cold-stor-
age units or air conditioners that can be turned on and off during peak periods.

The byproducts of DSM, along with an improved environment, are large
amounts of money — saved through the avoidance of mu] timill ion-dolla r power-
plant construction; lower energy bills to consumers; and a significantly reduced need
for energy in a country that relies on foreign oil and worries about its international Q)
industrial competitiveness. ”It is very easy to prove that demand-side options ...have
an economic return five to ten times greater than supply—side,” said energy consul-
tant Alan Streicher, in a Globe and Mail article in December, 1989.

The environment is reason enough. Electric utilities, especially those that
burn fossil fuels, are massive polluters. According to a comprehensive article on
demand—side management in the fan/Feb 1990 issue of Environment by Eric H irst
(a corporate fellow at the Energy Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory),
American utilities produce one-third of all national carbon dioxide (C02) emissions;
two-thirds of all sulfur dioxide (SOZ) emissions; one—third of all nitrogen oxide
(NOx) emissions; a great deal of thermal pollution (the unwanted warming of lakes
and rivers); and, as big consumers of oil, gas, and coal, they share responsibility for
the ecological damage caused in those industries. Furthermore, nuclear generating
stations produce hundreds of tons of nuclear-fuel waste each year, a potentially lethal
substance for which there is no fail-safe means of long-term disposal.

What can DSM realistically accomplish on a national scale in the United
States? These are Hirst’s estimates: If LLS. utilities run efficiency programs that
reach 5% of their customers each year and cut their electricity use by 20%, annual
electricity savings nationwide would be more than $60 billion by the year 2010. Four
hundred medium and large power plants would not be needed. And total COZ levels
will have dropped by 10%; $02 by 18% ; and NO), by 9%. A recent report from the
Electric Power Research Institute, an industry—funded center in Palo Alto,
California, estimates that energy—saving technologies that exist today could reduce
the total US. demand for electricity by 24% to 44% by the year 2000 —— enough to DI
satisfy the power needs of the 11 western states.

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

converting the lighting in all
homes and businesses, save
over $30 billion each year and
displace the energy production
of 120 Chernobyl-sized power
plants. According to In
Business, the technical potential
now exists to reduce the energy
consumption in US. lighting by
90%. And lighting, according
to a Wall Street Journal item
from last August, consumes
25% of all American power
generation. Utilities understand
these vast potentials very well.
Many are either subsidizing the
purchase of compact fluores-
cents or giving them away out-
right. The Los Ange/es Times
reported in February that
Southern California Edison had
recently handed out its 1 mil-
lionth complimentary compact
fluorescent bulb to a homeown-
er. Boston Edison offered
300,000 efficient bulbs to cus-
tomers last fall at $3 apiece.
New York City's Consolidated
Edison has a commercial subsi-
dization program in place that
cuts the cost of the bulbs by
about $12, meaning large-
scale buyers pay as little as $1
or less per bulb. A press
release from GTE Electric
Products, issued last December,
says Niagara Mohawk Power
Corp. rebated $326,473 to
Millard Filmore Hospital in
Buffalo, New York for installing
almost 12,000 compact fluores-
cents — the utility's largest sin-
gle conversion. For homeown-
ers, the picture is not quite as
rosy. A number of recent arti-
cles have noted that the bulbs
often don’t fit into existing fix-
tures because of their heavy
ballasts; they are expensive;
and to achieve promised effi-
ciency levels, they must be
operated for at least four hours
at a time. While the cost of
some compact fluorescent bulbs
is expected to come down this
year —- to less than $10
according to Amory Lovins —
an entire home retrofit is still
prohibitive for continued U‘

OVERVIEW: DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT

Demand—side techniques have been in effect to some degree since 1980, when
a number of US. electric utilities made the first offers of on—site energy audits to con-
sumers. The utilities were responding to the National Energy Conservation Policy
Act of 1978 — which was itself a response to the Middle Eastern oil embargo of
1973. However, it has only been during the past two or three years that DSM has
been viewed as an answer, not just an addendum. Utilities in California, New
England, and New York, have taken the lead with billion-dollar efficiency programs.

Yet not all utilities are convinced. Because demand-side management is
such a new science, and electric utilities are normally run by engineers who better
understand the building of power plants than they do conservation, there exists a
wide discrepancy between those investing in DSM and those paying it lip service.
Example: The Chicago Sun Times reported in [anuary that Commonwealth Edison,
the utility serving Chicago, invests only 39 cents per customer on conservation. A
nearby utility, Wisconsin Electric, is spending $51 per customer.

Lack of incentive has been a roadblock. Although a number of states are
pushing DSM, the US. federal government and its energy-related agencies have
shown little enthusiasm for energy efficiency, relative to what could be accomplished
through federal incentive programs. Utility rate formulas have also been a problem.
Many American utilities are owned by shareholders, and while DSM programs bene-
fit shareholders to the extent that they defer the construction of new plants, ongoing
return on investment is still based on the number of kilowatt hours that move
through the system — an economically entrenched disincentive to conserve.

But that appears to be changing. Regulators in California, New York, and
several northeastern states, working with environmentalists, have recently reformed
rates so that shareholders can earn a percentage of the value of every kilowatt hour
saved. The utilities are now able to boost their earnings, as The Wall Street Journal
observed last fall, ”by paying customers not to buy their main product.”

With such a reversal in logic has come a reversal in etiquette between envi-
ronmentalists and utilities. Environmental groups used to categorically deride elec-
tric companies over acid rain and nuclear proliferation. Now, the two sides are begin—
ning to collaborate. The Conservation Law Foundation of Boston, and New England
Electric System of Westboro, MA, jointly drafted new rate regulations last year and
pushed them through state regulatory channels. California’s rate reformation was
largely developed by the Natural Resources Defense Council, working in collabora-
tion with California’s investor-owned utilities.

Further testament to the value of saved electricity is the emergence of third—
party demand-side management firms. Utilities can now hire experts who will imple-
ment an entire DSM program on their behalf, marketing the concept to several hun-
dred commercial clients or several thousand residential users, installing and main-
taining equipment, and providing 100% of the financing —— in return for a royalty
on the energy saved (see interview with [ohn Laun on page 12 in this issue).

In the words of one energy analyst quoted in The Wall Street Journal last
November, investment in ”negawatts” by utilities and their suppliers ”has gone bal—
listic.” Saved electricity is a natural resource, and like a rich vein of ore, it only
awaits extraction. DSM is the tool.

 




 

 

 

 

 

most people. James Rusk, writ-
ing in The Globe and Mail last
December, calculated that at
$25 per bulb, the lowest price
he could find, it would cost him
$1,900 to change the lights
throughout his house. Despite
the savings in electricity, the
cost of that capital (in after—tax
dollars) would be $265 per
year at current interest rates. Of
course, the cash-flow picture
improves when a utility either
subsidizes or leases the bulbs
to its customers. The Taunton
Municipal Lighting Plant, a
small utility near Boston, has
been amortizing the cost of
commercial and industrial light-
ing retrofits over a five—year
period in monthly increments
billed to customers. According
to a Christian Science Monitor
article this pastJanuary, a Rand
McNally book plant in Taunton
pays $376 per month on its
electric bill for the program and
saves $2,510 per month in
electricity costs. Armond
Cohen, an attorney withthe
Conservation Law Foundation,
says this kind of financing is the
way of the future: ”We've
urged utilities away from a
rebate focus." Cohen’s group
believes that if conservation is
to work on a meaningful scale,
it must be financed just like a
power plant.

 

 

 

 

 

 

REELECTORS MAKE IT
BETTER YET

Also from The Christian Science
Monitor in January: Mirror-like
”specular reflectors” stretch the

efficiency of compact fluores—
cent lights even further —- typi-
cally providing 60% to 80% of
the light with half the number of
bulbs. Sales of the reflectors
and reflective materials have
increased dramatically. 3M
and Alcoa are the main produc-
ers of reflective material. The
market, says a 3M marketing
manager, is worth ”many mil-
lions of dollars.” There are
about 20 US. reflector makers.
One, from Austin, Texas, has
opened a distribution center in
New England where energy
saving is popular.

OVERVIEW: DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT

MEASURABLE PROGRESS ALREADY

DSM has already played a part in lowering national energy consumption.
Between 1950 and 1973, electricity use in the United States grew at an aver-
age rate of 8% per year. Then, between 1973 and 1988, it slowed substantially
to 2.7% due to government efficiency standards for appliances and new con—
struction, higher electricity prices, and the first DSM programs that were
tried by conservation-minded utilities. Had consumption continued to grow
at 8%, the amount of electricity used, its attendant pollution, and the number
of power plants in the United States would have at least doubled by now.

1 Most savings among residential and commercial customers have

been through more efficient appliances, lighting, insulation, water heating,

and heating and cooling systems. A number of utilities have also developed
central Control systems capable of interrupting residential and commercial

heating and cooling systems at peak periods. In industry, the key conserva-
tion measures have been lighting and heating retrofits, the improvement of

. industrial motor performance, controlled interruptions, the use of stand by

generators, and the rescheduling of customer usage to take advantage of
lower time—of-day rates.

THE TWO PILLARS OF CONSERVATION: LIGHTS & MOTORS

Much has been published on the miracles of energy-efficient lighting (see

- sidebar on compact fluorescent lights). An article last October in The Christian

Science Monitor mentioned an impressive example of the gains that can be
made through an extensive retrofit program: The Massachusetts state gov-
ernment has proposed to install compact fluorescent lights in 5,000 state-
owned buildings. The cost will be $4.5 million. The value of energy savings
in the first year alone is predicted to exceed $7 million. According to the
Ian / Feb issue of In Business, if the 40 million fire exit signs in buildings
across America were fitted with 9—watt compact fluorescents in place of
incandescent bulbs, annual savings would exceed $1.5 billion.

Improving the performance of industrial motors earns similarly
spectacular returns. Rocky Mountain Institute, the non-profit energy—policy
center in Snowmass, Colorado, has discovered 35 things that can be done to a
motor and its associated components that will save roughly half its energy
and return the cost of making the changes in a little over one year.

”LEAST COST INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING"

As w1th so many other environmentally progressive notions, demand-side

management is most popular in California and New England, with a handful
of standout utilities dotting the country in between. Some examples:

0 One of the more aggressive DSM advocates is Duke Power Company. The
nation’s eighth-largest utility, it serves North and South Carolina and has
been operating conservation programs to some extent for over 20 years.
Duke uses a Least Cost Integrated Resource Planning process, evaluating all
demand-side and supply-side options to find the most efficient and least
expenswe means of generating electricity. Duke now has extensive DSM prO‘

LEARNING FROM
OSAGE

As a caption in the
March/April 1989 issue of
Harrowsmith (US) says,
”Osage, Iowa could teach the
rest of the country a thing or
two about conservation.”
Indeed it could. Osage has
appeared in Harrowsmith and
other periodicals (New Age
Journal, Nov/ Dec 1990) for
the extraordinary demand—side
management programs that
Osage Municipal Utilities has
implemented since 1974. Since
1980, average electricity
usage in Osage, a town of
3,800 residents, has dropped
by 10%. In 1988, the town
saved $1.3 million or about
$315 per resident. ”It’s no dif-
ferent than having a new busi-
ness in town,” says Wes
Birdsall, the general manager
of the municipally owned utility.
”I don't see a difference
between a dollar brought in by
a new business and a dollar
that's saved due to energy con-
servation.” Birdsall, the man
behind Osage's conservation
practices, has cut rates five
times since 1974. His DSM tac-
tics have included infrared
scans of homes so people can
see where heat is escaping;
free water heater jackets and
weatherization materials; the
loan of tree spades and the
provision of free shade tree
saplings for planting around
homes; and a computer-
controlled load-management
program that sends radio sig-
nals to control units on air con-
ditioners, turning off their com-
pressors, but not their fans, dur-
ing peak consumption. At
Steele’s Super Value grocery,
owner Everett Steele put all his
refrigeration compressors into
an insulated compartment, then
fanned the excess heat into his
store. Savings: over $600 per
month in winter. The overall
benefit is that each year Osage
does not have to buy over $1
million of natural gas and elec-
tricity out of state. The money
stays in the small farm-belt
town, to the benefit of its
economy and its residents.

grams in place among residential, commercial, and industrial customers, and
claims that new efficiencies will result in the saving of about 900 megawatts
by 1995 — roughly equivalent to the combustion capacity of 12 turbines.

0 The New York Times reported last November that Long Island Lighting
Company in New York, after suffering a decade of critical power shortages,
has lowered usage sufficiently through DSM programs that it can now meet
its peak demand of 3,860 megawatts.

0 Central Maine Power Company, a medium-sized utility in Augusta, Maine,
has been running DSM initiatives since 1984. It pioneered ”all source bid-
ding” —— awarding grants to outside firms that can save electricity in the
most cost—efficient way. According to a Toronto Star article in April 1990,
Central Maine issued a call for proposals in 1988 for an extra 100 megawatts
of capacity, either through new generators or reductions. Thirty-seven pro-
posals were accepted. The top eight in terms of cost were DSM programs.

A New Jersey-based firm, SESCO Inc., is presently upgrading electricity use
in 10,000 homes in the Central Maine customer area. The utility pays nothing.
SESCO will earn a percentage of the value of the electricity it saves. A Wall
Street [oarnal article last November, referred to a Central Maine industrial
program, through which Keyes Fibre Co. of Waterville, Maine, will receive
about $2 million from the utility over the next 15 years to install energy-
saving equipment in its paper mill.

0 Another utility hiring outside demand-side managers is Niagara Mohawk
Power Company, the largest electric utility in upstate New York. An article in
the Jan / Feb issue of Home Energy, mentions a four-year, $10-million contract
awarded in 1989 to Syracuse Energy Services Company (SyrESCO) that
involves the weatherizing of 6,000 to 7,000 apartments in the Niagara
Mohawk service region.

INNOVATIVE NEW WAYS TO SQUEEZE 'I'I'IE GRID

Articles in both The New York Times and The Wall Street ]ournal predict that
energy conservation will be a high-growth business in the coming decade for
manufacturers and contractors who can extract negawatts with equipment
and expertise. Politically, it also has momentum. The Rocky Mountain
Institute says eight states now insist that all practical methods for making and
saving electricity must compete head to head. In other words, automatically
building generators is no longer acceptable.

Rocky Mountain Institute is, among other things, a clearinghouse for
information about utilities and their DSM programs. The Fall / Winter issue of
its Newsletter carried a comprehensive article on innovative new market-
driven programs at the leading edge of the DSM trend:

0 In seven states, utilities are experimenting with the concept of sliding-scale
”feebates” on new buildings. The utility charges a fee, or pays a rebate, when
the building is hooked up to the grid, depending on its energy efficiency. The
fees (and the saved electricity) pay for the rebates.

WHEN A BIG UTILITY
BALKS

Ontario Hydro is one of North
America’s largest electric
utilities. Over the next ten

years, it has proposed spend-
ing more than (CDN) $3 billion
on DSM programs and cus-
tomer-relations promotions to
convince people to use less
electricity. But Ontario Hydro is
also North America's most
ardent nuclear-power advocate.

Ontario derives over one-third

of its electricity from 20 nuclear
reactors. Over the next 25
years, Ontario Hydro wants to
build up to l4 more reactors,
plus 30 fossil-fuel-burning plants
and six hydroelectric dams. The
cost: over (CDN) $200 billion.
Its detractors do not believe the
huge utility is committed to

DSM, despite the money it has

earmarked for conservation.
They point out that it has free
access to capital markets and
appears to be immune to debt.
Already Ontario Hydro services
a debt exceeding (CDN) $27
billion — which accounts for
about half of the entire debt of
the province of Ontario. Ralph
Torrie, an Ottawa consultant on
energy conservation, was quot-
ed in a Toronto Star article last
April saying Ontario Hydro's
targets for electrical efficiency
are ”purely stopgap in nature.”
The Independent Power
Producers’ Society of Ontario
has stated, ”Hydro’s plan
expressly tests conservation
options solely against internal

Hydro economics, with no con-

sideration of the environmental

and social benefits of those
options.” A much-advertised
Hydro program to provide its
customers with a $l 0 rebate on
the purchase of a low-flow
showerhead has been roundly
condemned by critics as
tokenism. Torrie says that hav—
ing consumers pay the upfront
costs of conservation rather
than providing the funding and
rolling it into the rate base is
equivalent to asking the people
of Ontario ”to send financial
contributions toward the cost of
the next generating station."

OVERVIEW: DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT

0 Some utilities have started leasing energy-saving devices to their cus—
tomers. This idea was started by the Taunton, Massachusetts municipal utili-
ty. Customers pay for the devices —— mostly compact fluorescent bulbs — in
low monthly installments on their electric bill. Big utilities could lease more
expensive equipment like efficient industrial drivesystems.

0 In the US West, a number of utilities have contracted with each other to
buy and sell efficiency. One utility will pay another to save electricity. Then
the investing utility buys power from the utility that has conserved, at a price
that benefits both parties.

0 Puget Power in Washington sells electricity in one state and efficiency in
nine others, because, as the Newsletter says, “there’s no monopoly on efficien—
cy — it’s just a financial and informational prod uct.”

0 For the same reason, gas companies are getting interested in selling electric
efficiency. They can do it as well as electric utilities and d on’t ha ye a ”cultur-
al” reluctance to reducing kilowatt hours.

0 Marketed and supported properly, DSM programs can be in place far faster
than many observers once believed possible. New England Electric System
lately retrofitted 90% of a ZOO-customer commercial pilot program in only
two months; Pacific Gas & Electric moved a new program into 25‘“; of the
new commercial buildings in its market in only three months.

BIG UTILITIES, BIG COMMITMENTS

New England Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric are among a handful of big
utilities that have recently proposed huge long-term commitments to
demand-side management that will fully usher DSM into the mainstream.

The New England Electric proposal, developed in tandem with the
Conservation Law Foundation, calls for $85 million worth of energy efficien-
cy improvements in 1991, affecting 1.2 million customers in Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. According to recent reports in Solar
Today and In Business, the program would be the largest of its kind ever seen
in New England, providing high-efficiency lighting, insulation, and weather-
ization equipment to more than 20,000 homes, and the purchase and installa—
tion of thousands of efficient motors, lighting systems, and heating and ven-
tilation units in offices, factories, schools, and hospitals. New England
Electric says it Will save * each year — $160 million and the equivalent of 48

a leaked report that had been

province has a power-supply
emergency. The report was pre-
pared by a public opinion agen-
cy. According to a large adver-
tisement in The Globe and Mail,
run last December by Energy

group that monitors the activities
of Ontario Hydro, the report ”rec-
ommended the use of blackouts
and brownouts to convince the
public of the need for more nucle-
ar plants. Three months later,

warning of blackouts and
brownouts. Soon after, brownouts
occurred throughout the
province.” An investigation may

Ontario Hydro executives.

 

 

 

 

 

EPA WORKING WITH
BIG FIRMS ON
ENERGY EFFICIENCY

In January, the EPA unveiled a
plan to curb pollution by reduc-
ing the use of electricity in the
United States by at least IO°/o.
Twenty-three maior corporations
have volunteered under the pro-
gram —- called ”Green Lights” —
to install energy-efficient lighting
in their plants and offices over
the next five years. In announcing
the plan, the EPA was armed with
the usual impressive numbers that
result from such reductions: air
pollution will come down by 235
million tons, Or about 5% of the
national total; the reduced
demand for power will be the
equivalent of having 42 million
fewer automobiles on the road,
or roughly one-third of the entire
US. fleet. Green Lights is an
attempt by the US. government
to add some polish to its tar-
nished image as a carbon—diox-
ide emitter without conscience.

mentioned other significant investments by California utilities: Southern
California Edison Co. will spend $60 million on DSM this year and has asked
regulators for permission to boost that to $100 million a year by 1992;
Southern California Gas is spending $56 million; and the smaller but equally
aggressive San Diego Gas & Electric will invest $25 million on DSM.

The Wall Street journal reported last November that Consolidated
Edison Co. of New York plans to spend $4.1 billion on conservation by 2008.

NEW RATE RULES I-IAVE OPENED THE FLOODGATES

The big California DSM programs are directly related to landmark changes
made in utility regulations last August by the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC). After extensive negotiations among utilities, govern-
ment, and environmental and consumer groups, the new rules were formu—
lated to allow investor-owned utilities to earn roughly 15% on every dollar of
electricity they save.

California has been saving energy since the early 19705 when there
were a number of innovative changes in state energy policy, including tough
home appliance standards. In 1978, CPUC demanded that utilities invest in
conservation. The results, according to an article in the Jan / Feb 1991 issue of
World Watch: Californian utilities spent over $2 billion reducing energy use
and probably saved $10 billion worth of new power stations. In the decade
between 1978 and 1988, California’s economy reduced its use of electricity by
17% '— nearly three times better than the national average —- making the
state that much more competitive in national and international markets.

California’s new profit-from-conservation regulations have inspired
utilities to spend over $500 million on energy efficiency during the next two
years alone. This year, they will go after three times the energy savings they
achieved in 1988, when they were among the nation’s top DSM performers.
The California Energy Commission (CEC), the state agency that formulates
energy policy, has said efficiency improvements in the state can entirely offset
projected consumption increases, in spite of a rapidly growing population.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND STATE REGULATORS PUSHING

While electric companies are basking in the limelight of their new ecological-
ly responsible outlook, environmentalists and regulators can take much of
the credit. Environmentalists began getting involved in DSM planning in
1988, according to an article in the March / April 1989 issue of Harrowsmith
(US. edition). That year, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility
Control ruled that the $10.1 million that Connecticut Power and Light pro—
posed to spend on conservation was not enough; $18 million would have to
be spent. Connecticut Power and Light worked with environmentalists and
consumer groups to design a comprehensive DSM program. It was the first
of such collaborations —- forced on a utility by its regulators.

Environmental groups have since been the catalysts in moving a
number of utilities from supply-side to demand-side strategies. Today’s lead-
ers are the Conservation Law Foundation and the Natural Resources Defense
Council in California. And others are emerging. In Kentucky, according to a

PG&E: FINDING

”...Now the incentives are not
to build new plants but to invest
instead in energy efficiency...

cient air conditioning and light-
ing throughout their building. It
cost them $1 million. We gave

tives like these have got to be

icy. Energy efficiency has got to

OVERVIEW: DEMAND-SIDE MANAGEMENT

December article in the Louisville Courier-journal, an environmental group
named the Paddlewheel Alliance is inﬂuencing energy-conservation policy
in that state through demand-side schemes they are proposing to the
Kentucky Public Service Commission. And in British Columb1a,the
Vancouver Sun reported in an editorial last January that the provmce’s
government-owned electrical utility, formerly a “macho dam builder,” has
shelved all construction plans and embraced DSM with almost theological
zeal. One BC. Hydro executive paid a compliment to the environmentalists
his organization used to fight. “They were on the right track,” he says. “They
were out there on the leading edge.”

THE FEDS FIDDLE WHILE AMERICA BURNS...OIL AND COAL

The bad news, according to Eric Hirst and other writers on the subject, is that
the US. federal government is generally ignoring energy efficiency. President
Bush’s recently announced National Energy Strategy (see sidebar) doggedly
relies on fossil fuels and provides only nominal support for national energy
efficiency. Furthermore, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),
which approves all wholesale transactions among utilities, does not even
consider energy efficiency when reviewing long-term contracts. 1 first sug-
gests that FERC could simply require utilities to demonstrate they ha d priced
all supply- and demand-side options to find the lowest—cost electricity. He
also points to federal power—marketing agencies like Bonneville Power
Administration and the Tennessee Valley Authority (an independent federal
corporation), which account for nearly one-tenth of all electricity consumed
in the United States. In the past, both have run large DSM programs that
saved energy and served as a model for other utilities. But these programs
have been reduced substantially because of short-term bud get consid era—
tions. In fact, TVA recently cancelled all conservation programs, a clearly
regressive step. New legislation, says Hirst, could ensure that DSM programs
be expanded in these big agencies and that environmental factors a re consid-
ered in their cost / benefit analysis of all resource alternatives.

REACHING AMERICA THROUGH A FEW HUNDRED UTILITIES

The results achieved thus far by independent utilities working on their own
to save electricity is extremely impressive. Yet with federal government assis—
tance it could be miraculous. Hirst believes the government is wasting an
enormous Opportunity: ”Because electricity production consumes almost
40% of the primary energy used in the United States,” he writes, ”electricity
must be a major part of national energy policy. In addition, national concerns
about environmental quality, economic productivity, international competi-
t1veness, and national security suggest that the federal government should
do more to help utilities implement DSM programs. Government agencies
are likely to find that working with electric utilities is a particularlvf effectiVe
way toget consumers to improve their energy efficiency because utilities
have direct. contact with all their customers on a monthly basis through
E:‘:r;c::d1ngand billmg and are generally well-respected organizations in
munlties. Thus, the federal government can deal with a few hun-

THE BIISI'I ENERGY
PLAN: DSWI'IAT?

The president’s proposed
National Energy Strategy,
which was announced in
February, does little for compa-
nies selling conservation.
Among proposals that will
exert a positive effect on the
environment are an overhaul-
ing of utility regulations to
increase competition for whole-
sale power while promoting the
use of renewable fuels; the
requirement of ”cost-effective,
energy-efficient standards” in
new buildings; and encourage-
ment for lenders to consider
fuel-efficiency ratings when
approving home mortgages.
Bush also wants to ease regula-
tions governing the construction
of nuclear plants and gas
pipelines; and to increase
domestic oil production by leas—
ing controversial offshore sites
and allowing drilling to pro-
ceed in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. He offers noth-
ing to companies that produce
alternative forms of energy or
install conservation equipment.
Scott Fenn, of the Investor
Responsibility Research Center,
a research organization for
institutional investors, told the
Los Ange/es Times that without
federal help, renewable energy
llwill be a growing market but I
don't think it will be big
enough to make a significant
impact on the overall energy
situation.” Says Deborah

Institute for Energy
Conservation: ”In Washington,

find a compact fluorescent, it
would be virtually impossible.”

dred utilities and, through them, reach millions of businesses and tens of mil-
lions of households.”

INCREASE PROFITS BY DECREASING ENERGY COSTS

If the environmental argument is still not convincing enough for an adminis-
tration wedded to oil, the gains through DSM in economic productivity and
international competitiveness should be. In a Globe and Mail article published
in October 1988, Amory Lovins tells of Southwire Corp, a major American
wire-maker that employed two engineers to examine its energy use. They
reduced it by 56% —— almost exactly equalling the firm’s loss in profits
through a difficult period. ”So,” concludes Lovins, ”it’s hardly an exaggera-
tion to say that two engineers saved 3,500 jobs at ten plants in six states by
making a very marginal company into a profitable one... The smart way to
increase your profits is to decrease your production costs.”

Craig Canine, writing in Harrowsmz'th, projects gains like those made
by Southwire across the entire country. To students of basic economics, it’s a
familiar refrain: The US spends roughly 10% of its gross national product on
energy. The Japanese spend about 5%. That makes U.S. products at least 5%
more expensive on world markets than comparable Japanese products. And
the gap is expected to widen as Japan continues to hone its energy efficiency.
”If the United States were to pursue energy efficiency as vigorously as Japan
does,” writes Canine, ”it could save $1.3 trillion to $2.2 trillion (in 1987 dol-
lars) over the next 20 years, cutting its oil imports by up to 3.5 million barrels
per day and reducing its trade deficit by $20 billion to $40 billion per year. By
avoiding the need to build hundreds of costly power plants over the next
two decades, investments in energy efficiency would free up more than $100
billion per year for capital investments in other industries, including much-
needed environmental projects. This would create more jobs and provide
US. industry with a better competitive position in world markets.”

llIn the 19905,” writes Ralph Cavanagh, a senior staff attorney and
head of the energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, in
Home Energy magazine, ”the most profitable utilities will be the ones that
keep their customers satisfied — not by selling them a commodity at the low—
est rate, but by providing them an energy service at the lowest overall cost.
It’s a simple idea, but its time has come.” M

tomers. During that time, Laun served for three years as a member of the Electric
Power Research Institute’s Demand-Side Planning Task Force, and he testified on
demand—side issues before the California Public Utilities Commission and the
California Energy Commission. He is now the president and chic executive officer of
Demand-Side Resources, an energy services company that assists utilities and their
customers in implementing demand-side strategies. Based in Annapolis, Maryland
and newly formed this year, Demand—Side Resources essentially hunts negawatts on
behalf of utilities, installing the necessary equipment in the plants and offices of
major electricity users, and financing the whole operation in return for an ongoing
royalty from the utility. In cases where load management is required, Loan and his
associates plan to set up an office within the utility’s territory, staff it, and monitor
the electrical usage of major customers with computers. In 1991, Demand—Side
Resources hopes to have contracts to provide 200 megawatts of DSM-reclairned
power in place —— the equivalent of $200 million not spent on new fossil—fuel plants.
EcoSource asked Iohn Laun to cast further light on this remarkable new field.

ES: When did demand-side management ﬁrst emerge and who were its proponents?

JL: It started with government mandates in the late 19705 in response to the oil crisis.
There were some federal programs that encouraged conservation and energy-use
audits. California took the lead among states. There were two key strategies: conser—
vation, which was generally a matter of reducing energy consumption by improving
insulation; and load management, which is the cycling of appliances at various times
to balance peak loads. Those basic strategies evolved into demand-side management,
a concept developed and popularized by the Electric Power Research Institute.

DSM has since broadened to include other types of load-affecting measures
thatcustomers can take advantage of by changing their use of electricitv. Load shift—
ing is a prime example. This is where you move a percentage of peak—load demand to
a time of low load. It works well with cool storage air conditioning, where a commer—
cial building can operate chilling units at night to make a reservoir of cold water or

ice, for example, and then cool the building during the day by drawing down the
coolness stored in the reservoir.

ES: What is the signiﬁcance of demand-side management today in the power-supply business?

JL: It is very significant. The business has recognized that customers simpr bV
changing the1r usage of electricity, can have the same impact on the system as the
addmgof new generatlon. Some utilities are stating that their entire additional capaci-
gST/Iqrirements for. the next 10 or so years can be met by increasing conservation and

Foundation. They’ve struck a bargain with the utilities in New England. They’ve said,
”If you do least-cost planning and a meaningful amount of demand-side manage-
ment, the Conservation Law Foundation will endorse and support shareholder incen-
tives so you can make a profit on the electricity you save.”

In California, the catalyst has been the Natural Resources Defense Council
(N RDC). It has been pushing utilities for a number of years to undertake larger con-
servation programs. The utilities that did practice DSM weren’t getting the kind of
results that the N RDC thought they could. So NRDC published a study that showed
that as energy prices fell in the late 19805, California utilities had allowed their conser-
vation spending to drop off. The study snowballed into a collaborative process that
eventually involved 25 or 30 parties. The process lasted about six months with alter-
native funding and technology options being presented and debated. The Public
Utilities Commission gave the N RDC position a strong endorsement.

It wasn’t a matter of the utilities not being interested. There was the need to
remove a major disincentive. In any business the focus goes to those areas central to
the core business. With utilities, responsibility to shareholders and customers is
strongly felt. In the end, of course, the regulations were changed so shareholders can
profit. The California utilities are now making far larger DSM investments.

ES: Once shareholders are happy, are there other barriers to full-scale demand-side commitment?

JL: Shareholders’ interests are only one of a series of barriers, or at least things that
have to be handled correctly. You also have to let customers know what the technical
options are, then apply the technology correctly. If it is improperly applied, either you
don’t get the savings, or worse, there can actually be an impairment. Financing is also
a big hurdle. It often takes a large upfront investment to extract these energy efficien—
cies because the payout is over a long period of time. And utilities have a very strong
ethic that says service must be reliable. DSM is new and can be difficult to meter —— to
verify that you are getting the anticipated benefits —— whereas, with a turbine genera-
tor, you know the output. 50 it is critical that everybody involved with utility plan—
ning is comfortable with DSM. The benefits have to show.

ES: You mentioned letting people know. How does a utility bring DSM to its customers?

JL: It isn’t just a matter of information dispersal, but also marketing —— being able to
put knowledgeable and motivated salespeople in the field to call on customers, to
understand each customer’s application, and to convince the customer to buy into the
plan. Marketing has been de-emphasized at utilities for a number of years. Few of
them have a big staff of marketing people, although some are trying to build one.

There’s a trend toward marketing centers. Southern California Edison just
opened possibly the most comprehensive of such centers in the world. It demon—
strates not only energy efficiency but equipment that offers substantial environmental
benefit. Consumers are invited to centers like this, but primarily they are aimed at the
larger customers who need sophisticated technologies.

ES: In all these programs, there is considerable variance in funding. Who ultimately pays?

JL: There is a fundamental cost/ benefit debate that rages whenever DSM is being
considered. What we have been talking about is the customer winning because he
gets an improved facility and saves money. The more difficult issue concerns cus—
tomers that don’t participate, and how they are affected. Rates usually go up to help
offset the costs of the program. Those customers who participate save electricity and
therefore experience lower bills overall. But those who don’t participate just get a rate
increase. And the larger the program, the greater the increase. The key, in my view, is
to make sure DSM programs are available to all customers so everyone has the option
of reducing their bills.

ES: How are large DSNl programs financed? C

JL: The first utility DSM programs provided audits and design assistance and then
rebates to help offset -— but not eliminate —— the cost of the installation. I his way, the
customer seeks financing for the balance. As the customer saved money on his energy
bills, the installation would pay for itself. Customers usually look for a payback of
under three years. Utility rebates are designed to get the customer’s payback down to
an acceptable range. __ .

More recently, companies like ours have put together the trnancrng. We
approach a utility and offer to install a certain number of megawatts ot cool storage or
efficient lighting or some other form of efficiency. We finance the whole operation and
then take a payment from the utility over 15 years that is tied to their avoided costs
for the megawatts we saved. We might also share in the savings the customer gets
from installation.

\w/

ES: Why can’ta utility do the same thing on its own?

JL: Utilities certainly are capable of doing it —— and many do. But it requires putting
all the components in place, including the money. We offer a turn—key project. The
utility doesn’t have to make the commitment to personnel and the other talents and
techniques. And we work on a pay-for-performance basis. If we don’t generate those
25 megawatts of cool storage, the utility has no obligation to pay us.

ES: What is the extent of the work you might do with the average utility?

JL: We focus on commercial facilities. Let’s imagine we are looking for a total of 25

megawatts of cool storage. A typical large office building might yield halt a megawatt

in shifting cooling from peak to the off-peak time periods. So we might work in 50

buildings. We would set up a regional operation in the service territory of the utility, .
put in place a marketing force, an engineering force, and an auditing force. Over three 6 l;
to five years we would solicit the owners, obtain a contract from each, do the prelimi- ‘/ ”
nary design, then manage the construction. We would subcontract the hard ware,

using commercially available cool-storage systems.

our headquarters. Our computer communicates with each of the members of the co—
operative and asks if they can shed certain loads for certain periods of time. We might
commit through the co-operative to 25 megawatts of load relief for 100 hours a year
—— any 100 hours the utility needs.

What we are doing is convincing a group of customers who may think all
their loads are critical that there is still valuable capacity in their facilities. It might be
a matter of turning off some lights that are not essential, or turning off the fountain in
the foyer, or perhaps there is an on-site emergency generator that can be used for a
number of hours every month. The point is, substantial amounts of electricity can
invariably be found by operating a plant or office complex a little differently. The
financial incentive is in the form of a payment from the utility to my firm that is
divided among the members of the co-op in proportion to their performance.

ES: Who are some maior firms involved in this kind of scheme?

JL: I should mention that our company is actually a licensee of John Phillips, the man
who invented the energy co-operative concept. He has developed them for Southern
California Edison, Long Island Lighting, and Boston Edison, and he has consulted
widely with other utilities. I believe some of the larger co-operative members in
Boston Edison’s service area include the John Hancock headquarters, the Prudential
tower, the headquarters of the Christian Science Church, the Federal Reserve Bank,
Boston General Hospital, and Digital Equipment.

ES: Organizations like these presumably wouldn't participate if there wasn’t a significant return.

JL: There are significant savings. And as with any DSM program, there are other
”soft” benefits too. Energy cooperatives involve large, high-profile companies. They
are big players in their communities. They derive benefit from interacting with each
other —— the energy and facilities managers are refining all of their activities — and
they get a positive public relations benefit from doing the right thing in their commu-
nities. They are conserving energy on a large scale. I also view DSM as a major oppor-
tunity for a utility to forge a very close partnering link with all its customers.

ES: With DSM, ”excessive" consumers of electricity are now being ”penalized” with higher rates, whereas before,
big-volume users were rewarded with lower rates. How are rate structures changing?

Jl.: The basic goal with utilities has been to get rates to reﬂect the marginal cost of
producing electricity. The marginal cost is essentially the cost of underwriting the
next increment, the next kilowatt or kilowatt-hour. DSM generally works well with
this system because almost always a utility’s cost will be highest at the time of its sys-
tem peak. So if you establish rates that vary by the time of day and by the season, you
send a higher price signal during the times you want customers to consume less.

But the typical utility time-of—use rate is a blunt instrument. The new refine-
ment is real-time pricing. Niagara Mohawk, New York State Electric & Gas, Pacific
Gas &: Electric, Southern California Edison, and Georgia Power have all experimented
with this kind of pricing. It works like this: A group of customers are sent, often via
computer links, a price — the marginal cost adjusted for fixed costs and so forth —
that varies much more frequently than a normal time-of—use price. They have the abil-
ity to change their consumption in response to the changing price signal — by the
hour. Again, it’s a matter of taking an existing but untapped capability and turning it
into a product that benefits the utility, and in this case, the customer and society too.

ES: What is the current regulatory environment for DSM, and what is Congress doing?

JL: The regulatory environment over the last two years has improved markedly. The
National Association of Regulatory Commissioners has passed a resolution that
essentially says a least-cost plan should be a utility’s most profitable plan. That reso-
lution makes way for DSM. It has been the underpinning of regulatory changes in the
states, particularly California. A number of other states, such as Pennsylvania, are fol-
lowing. A couple of bills have been introduced by Congressman Sharp and others in
the House of Representatives that address legislation on this whole broad area, and as
far as I know, they deal point blank with the issue. 2‘»

DENMARK: BRAVE
NEW ENERGY WORLD

The Swedish publication Acid
News ran an item in its
December 1990 issue outlining
Denmark's ambitious program
for reducing its energy require-
ments and shifting to more envi-
ronmentally preferable sources
of energy. Called Energi 2000,
the plan is Denmark’s answer to
the call of the Brundtland com-
mission for the industrialized
world to halve its use of energy
within 50 years and cut its out-
put of greenhouse gases.
Energi 2000 proposes a broad
decentralization of power pro-
duction, from large coal-fired
plants to small gas-fired ones,
as well as greatly increased use
of wind power, solar energy,
geothermal energy, and biofu-
els. Increased energy charges
would be levied on industry, but
the income would be channeled
back to manufacturers in the
form of incentive subsidies for
energy-saving investments.The
plan also calls for: 0 Energy
consumption standards for
home appliances and office
equipment. 0 Lower fixed
charges for electricity and heat-
ing, but higher consumption
charges, to encourage energy
conservation. 0 The govern—
ment setting an example by
auditing and tightly controlling
its own use of energy in all gov-
ernment buildings. Energi
2000 has been adopted by
the Danish parliament, although
industry has expressed some
skepticism. If it works, the coun-
try’s energy sector alone, by
the year 2005, will reduce its
emissions of carbon dioxide by
almost 30%, its nitrous oxides
by 50%, and its sulfur dioxide
by 60%. Denmark has already
demonstrated that environmen—
tal adversity can lead to valu—
able technologies. Danish firms
are successfully exporting wind
turbines and systems for
cleaning flue gases.

SWEDEN: WINDING NUCLEAR DOWN WITH DSM

Sweden generates more nuclear energy per capita than any other country

on

Earth, and the Swedes are among the world’s most electricity-hungry peo-

ples, thanks to their long, cold winters and strong industrial sector. But in
January, according to a report in New Scientist, the Swedish government
renewed a controversial promise to close down the country’s 12 nuclear
plants over the next 20 years. By the year 2000, it hopes to have curtailed

electricity use to pre-1990 levels —— an ambitious goal in a growing economy.

Conventional non-nuclear energy planning would shift the emphasis

onto fossil-fuel plants, but Sweden has also promised that its emissions of

C02, the main greenhouse gas, will drop to 1986 levels by the year 2010. To
complicate the issue even further, the government has agreed that it will not
build any more hydroelectric dams, yet will maintain high employment and

an annual economic growth rate of 1.9%.

Conservative politicians and industrialists do not believe the coun-
try’s nuclear reactors can be replaced with minimally polluting alternatives.

But energy planners, led by Professor Thomas Johansson of Lu nd U nivers

ity,

have devised a new kind of analysis that examines the costs and benefits —
both economic and environmental — of all forms of available energy. Based
on that analysis, they believe Sweden can not only phase out nuclear power

but live up to its carbon targets too.
Iohansson and his colleagues point out that Swedish government

energy planners, like utility planners worldwide, have historically assessed

the growth of demand alongside economic growth, then forecasted future

needs and erected power plants to satisfy them. Now, the Swedes will follow
a least-cost strategy — assessing need, assessing all possible forms of energy

that can be generated or saved, and adopting the least expensive options.
For example, Vatenfall, the Swedish energy board, estimates that

there are approximately 50 TWh (terrawatt hours, each TWh is equal to l bil-
lion kilowatt hours) of potential biomass power in bark, branches, and saw-
dust from the timber industry. Another 40 TWh could be produced from fast-
growing trees planted solely for energy. And 3 TWh of wind potential could
be installed by 2010. (The cost of replacing nuclear energy with alternatives
will be offset to some extent by a [US] $150-per-ton carbon emissions tax the

Swedish government plans to introduce this year).

According to a December 14 report in the Financial Tililt’S (England),

bpth the Swedish government and Vatenfall have ambitious plans to curb
e ectr1c1ty consumption. The price of electricity — among the lowest in

Europe —— has already been adjusted to reﬂect time of use. Peak-10a d use now

costs more. The government has also increased VAT taxes on electricity. And
building codes were tightened considerably in the 19805 requiring that new
buildlngs be tighter and better insulated. Swedish electric utilitiesbalso run

ECOLOGICAL CONCERN ESCALA'I'ING ACROSS THE WORLD

Articles in The Financial Times (England) and The Christian Science
Monitor earlier this year both concluded that the world’s environmen-
tal agenda will be full in 1991 and that governments and industry will
be under greater pressure to act as levels of concern intensify.

In March, The Financial Times said the “green revolution” will
continue unabated because of tougher national legislation and interna-
tional agreements aimed at reducing pollution and cutting the huge
volumes of waste produced by afﬂuent consumer societies. A recent
report by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) warns that consumption within its 24 member-
countries — including the US, western Europe, Japan, and Canada ——
will place an immense strain on the world’s environment and
resources. The Times pointed out that considerable progress has been
made by world industries. “Cradle-to-grave” approaches to production
and disposal are gaining ground rapidly. Companies are assessing the
environmental consequences of their manufacturing and their expan-
sion plans. Environmental audits have become important measuring
and monitoring tools. And many industries are cutting their consump-
tion of energy and resources while trimming their waste. (The Swedish
paper industry, for example, reduced its water needs by 50% between
1960 and 1980.) However, international pressures to cut greenhouse
gases are intensifying despite voices of skepticism, and will culminate
next year at the UN. Conference on Environment and Development in
Brazil. Restrictive agreements limiting global carbon outputs are
inevitable. In the European Community, environmental issues are high
on the legislative agenda. Tough financial instruments like carbon and
fossil-fuel taxes, charges on polluting materials, and deposits on bottles
and containers will likely be put in place across the continent. Industry
will also experience a steady tightening of environmental laws.

The United States, according to The Christian Science Monitor,
will see an unusual amount of legislative and policy activity concern-
ing the environment. As the Energy Department moves toward a
national energy strategy, environmentalists are pushing for tighter
auto-efficiency standards, claiming these would address a host of
pressing problems: cutting carbon dioxide emissions, thus reducing
global warming; decreasing pollution; reducing the number of oil
spills; and avoiding the need to drill for oil in sensitive areas like the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In addition: 0 The federal highway bill
is being rewritten, providing an opportunity to alot a portion of the
annual highway budget of $14.5 billion to environmental measures
(like special lanes for high-occupancy vehicles). 0 Most provisions of
the Clean Water Act expire this year, allowing legislators to focus on
wetland destruction, agricultural runoff, sewer overflows, and other
water-related problems. 0 The Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act is up for renewal. New laws will be created governing toxic wastes,
landfilling, and incineration. 0 The Endangered Species Act will also be
revised. Various industries are pressing to have economic concerns
included when deciding to list an animal or plant as endangered or
threatened. Presently, the classifications are strictly environmental.

GIVING THE ENVIRONMENT SENIOR-EXECUTIVE STATUS

A sure sign that the environment is becoming a deeply ingrained

strategic issue within major US. corporations is a trend, cited in The

New York Times in March, to consolidate environmental policy in the
hands of a single top-level executive, or to upgrade and expand exist-
ing environmental departments.

Last July, for example, IBM Corp. appointed Arthur J. Hedge
Jr. to the new job of vice president of environment, health and safety.
Based at IBM’s Armonk, New York headquarters, Hedge and a staff of
30 recruited from within the organization will ensure that environmen-
tal policy is implemented uniformly throughout IBM. Observers quot-
ed in the article say IBM is centralizing its environmental efforts under
a key executive to ensure, among other things, that plant managers
don’t sacrifice environmental quality in pursuit of profit goals —— a
temptation in economic downturns. Says Hedge: ”We needed one
high-level group to focus our environmental efforts, and to send a clear
signal that management cares about the environment.”

Until Du Pont Co. chairman Edgar Woolard Jr. called for “cor—
porate environmentalism” in the spring of 1989 and pronounced him-
self “chief environmentalist,” the company’s vice president of safety,
health and environmental affairs, Bruce W. Karrh, often had to deal
with reticent plant managers who balked at committing resources to
environmental projects. After Woolard’s statement, the managers start—
ed calling Karrh. Since 1987, Du Pont has increased its head office envi-
ronmental staff from three people to 11, and installed a more rigorous
environmental auditing process.

Environmental auditing is also taking on greater significance at
both Ciba—Geigy Corporation and Polaroid Corporation. In 1989, C iba-
Geigy put all its environmental auditors into a stand-alone group that
reports directly to CEO Richard Barth. And last January, the company
established a ”governance committee” of the board of directors that
will oversee any issue that affects Ciba-Geigy’s reputation. Headed by
Barth, the committee’s first concern is environmental matters. Polaroid
ha??? a complex auditing System in place (see ”Strategies &
Initiatives,” this issue), and while it has had senior people in technical
positions relating to the environment since 1987, it recently added a
senlor marketing person who will ensure the company’s products and
packaging do not create unnecessary waste.

response to local opposition, the state legislature passed a law requir-
ing operators of such sites to compensate landowners within a three-

135,000 per year. Environmentalists are worried the demand will lead
to over-development and increased traffic in relatively unspoiled areas,
such as New England's Northeastern Forest. The Newark Star—Ledger
reported in February that both the US. Forest Service and the Maine

federal government reconsider its policy of allowing second-home

pollution-control technologies —— smokestack scrubbers to neutralize
gases, incineration plants for hazardous wastes, and recycling units for
coolants and solvents -— all costly end—of—pipe solutlons W1th no finan-
cial return. But lately, according to an article in The Wall S treet ]0arnal, a
growing number of companies, particularly large companies, are alter-
ing their manufacturing techniques to avoid offending wastes altogeth-
er. And they are cutting costs in the process.

The undisputed champion of this approach is 3M Corp. (see
“Strategies & Initiatives,” this issue), which has made over 2,500 manu—
facturing changes since 1975 and saved over $500 million. But other
companies are also seeing the light: 0 Carrier Corp., a unit of United
Technologies Corp., decided in 1987 to adopt “clean” technologies. One
year later, it revamped the manufacturing of air conditioners, first elim—
inating toxic lubricants in favor of non-toxic alternatives, then fine-tun—
ing its presses to cut metal parts and create coils with less friction and
waste, and designing an air conditioner with fewer joints so it needs
less soldering. The result: production costs dropped by $1.2 million a
year; an environmentally unfriendly ”degreasing” line was eliminated;
automation increased; and the product improved. Other examples: 0
AT&T replaced the CFCs it formerly used to clean circuit boards with a
detergent solution that costs 40% less. Because the solution must still be
treated, a new evaporating rosin system is being developed that will
eliminate treatment altogether. 0 Clairol switched to foam balls from
water to flush pipes in hair-care product manufacturing, reducing
water waste by 70% and saving $240,000 in disposal costs. 0 Reynolds
Metals replaced solvent-based ink with water-based in its packaging
plants, cutting emissions by 65% and saving $30 million it would have
had to spend on pollution-control equipment. 0 Union Carbide devel-
oped a system that replaces solvents with carbon dioxide as a medium
for paint spraying, thereby cutting volatile emissions by 72%. 0 Whyco
Chromium Co., which coats nuts and bolts for corrosion resistance, cut

its costs 25% and application time 50% by developing an organic sub-
stltute for a nickel-cadmium-copper compound.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

CLOTH DIAPERS DROOPING 4"?

The cloth diaper took hold in Canada in late 1989. Now, according to
two articles in Canadian papers last January, the markets for cloth dia-
pers, and diaper stocks, have gone soft. The Financial Post reported that
Babykins International Inc. of Vancouver went public in March 1990 at
50 cents per share, rose to $1.50, but was trading at only 36 cents in
January. Dimples Corp. of Markham, Ontario, which had been up to
$2.45, was down to 85 cents. And a company called Hapi-Napi
Diapers, also of Vancouver, had gone out of business. In an article on a
general downturn in ecological enthusiasm, The Cal ga r11 Herald report-

ed tbhat Calgary’s only cloth diaper service was experiencing a consid-
era le drop 1n busmess after a brief boom last spring.

PU'I'I'ING POWER STATIONS IN OTHER PEOPLE'S YARDS

According to a study published by the Paris office of Cambridge
Energy Research Associates, N IMBYism will make power-plant siting
more and more difficult in Europe, and electricity companies will
increasingly try to overcome the problem by locating plants in other
countries and importing some of the energy — a trend known as the
”California syndrome” because utilities in that state came up with the
idea. The study, titled ”European Electric Power Trends,” says local
opposition has already effectively ruled out further expansion of both
nuclear and hydro-electric facilities in many European countries, and it
will continue to be the most important environmental constraint this
decade. Thus, EN EL, Italy’s state-owned electric utility, wants to build
13,000 megawatts of new capacity in the Soviet Union and bring 25% of
the power back to Italy. The French utilities Electricité de France and
Framatome would like to build two nuclear power stations in Hungary,
and sell a portion of the power to Germany and Italy.

The European reported in February that nuclear power has been
a ”delicate and divisive” issue in Europe since Chernobyl. Public oppo-
sition is strong and there is a powerful anti-nuclear lobby in the
European Parliament. Belgium, which relies on nuclear for almost 70%
of its power, has halted all plans for new reactors, opting for combined-
cycle gas turbines. France, Europe’s strongest nuclear proponent, has
slowed its nuclear development from five new reactors per year to one
every three years. Two major worries: 0 Reactors in the former East
Germany and the Soviet Union are aging and probably unsafe. Last
December, EC leaders agreed to provide (US) $56 million to help the
Soviets manage their reactors, even though the EC does not have the
technical expertise to refurbish Chernobyl-style reactors, which account
for 40% of Soviet nuclear facilities. 0 The massive cost of decommis-
sioning and “sanitizing” other European plants as they reach the end of
their lives will cost as much as 15% of their initial construction costs.

 

 

 

FRANCE GETTING GREENER, SLOWLY

A study of the environmental attitudes of European corporations, con-
ducted by Touche Ross Europe Services in 1989 (see EcoSource, June
1990), found French companies woefully unconcerned about environ-
mental issues. At that time, there was almost no public pressure to
make them feel otherwise. An article in The Globe and Mail last
February says matters have improved somewhat. France’s Green Party
has 15% of public support. Brice Lalonde, the country’s Minister of the
Environment, was formerly the director of the French office of Friends
of the Earth. Last December, he was elevated from junior minister to
full cabinet status. One of his targets is French farmers. Compelled by
EC directives, Lalonde wants farmers to reduce livestock efﬂuents and
their use of nitrate fertilizers, which are polluting the country’s drink-
ing water. Curiously, Lalonde — and Friends of the Earth — have not
taken aim at France’s 52 nuclear reactors. Acceptance of nuclear power
apparently has it roots in the French desire for self-sufficiency.

LIFE-CYCLE STUDIES: GROWING DEMAND, CONFUSION

McDonald’s Corp/3 polystyrene foam surrender was a victory for the
environment. Or was it? An article in The Christian Science Monitor in
February drew a bead on “life-cycle” assessments —- studies being .
done on products like polystyrene and paper disposables to determine
the impact they have on the environment through each phase of their
”lives,” from raw materials to disposal. The Monitor author’s conclu—
sion: life—cycle studies are being employed with growing frequency by
corporations and researchers, but most results are inconclusive because
no common methodology has been adopted.

The McDonald’s case illustrates the confusion. A study by
Franklin Associates of Kansas City, Kansas held that polystyrene foam
containers compare favorably to bleached paperboard. In fact, foam
needs 30% less energy and creates 46% less air pollution. That led
Forbes magazine to run a story headlined ”McDonald’s caves in.” Then
a researcher at the Environmental Defense Fund, which helped
McDonald’s reach its decision to ban polystyrene, took bleached paper—
board out of the equation and recalculated the numbers based on the
new McDonald’s paper wrapper, which is one-third as thick as paper-
board. His numbers tilted toward the new wrapper in terms of energy
use, air emissions, water discharges, and solid waste production.
Likewise, a recent study by an associate professor at the University of
British Columbia that compares polystyrene cups to paper cups and
concludes that plastic is environmentally superior, fails to consider
emissions of styrene and benzene related to the raw materials used to
make foam cups (or the dioxins related to paper cups).

Marjorie Franklin, president of Franklin Associates, begs off on
the issue of complex chemical repercussions with this statement:
”We’re not toxicologists.” According to John Young, a researcher at the
Worldwatch Institute, that sort of imprecision brings the studies into
question: “The usefulness of their conclusions is often close to zero.”

Nevertheless, studies that come out in favor of a product will

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

inevitably be used by advertisers as weapons in the battle for market
share. But they might not always work. Ed Rensi, president of
McDonald’s USA, paid more attention to a key market force

researchers will never be able to quantify with calipers. “[AJlthough
some scientific studies indicate that foam packaging is environmentally
sound,” says Rensi, “our customers just don’t feel good about it.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

TADS ABOUT CORPORATE GREENNESS GE'I'I'ING PANIIﬂ

A study by ad agency Ogilvy 8: Mather, mentioned in The Wall Street
Journal last December, shows that consumers dislike advertising cam-
paigns that promote corporate environmental benevolence — dona-
t1ons to groups and causes. They prefer claims describing actual
ghanges companies are making to their processes. Yet a growing num—
I)er of companies are employing cause-related marketing. They include
rocter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Warner-Lambert and Sears
Roebuck. Typical of the genre is a slogan from WD-40, maker of a lubri—

cating 011: Stop squeaks, prevent rust and preserve National Parks.”

MINING FIRM EARNS GREENIE POINTS

An article in The Financial Times (England) last November told the story
of a Canadian junior mining company that has inadvertently become
involved in a rainforest restoration plan in Costa Rica. The article sug-
gests that such attention to the environments of developing countries
may well become a pre-condition of working there. The company —
Greenstone Resources of Toronto — was forced to assess its Costa
Rican mining plans against environmental criteria because of a
$300,000 grant it received from the Canadian International
Development Agency (CIDA). CIDA also insisted Greenstone do a
”community needs” study that detailed the most pressing concerns of
local people. The company’s consultants found that the rainforest had
been clearcut many years ago to make way for cattle, and the resulting
runoff had leached heavy metals into the drinking water supply. It was
determined that the runoff problem could be solved with a $200,000
investment, and, better still, the 800-hectare rainforest could be
restored given roughly $1 million and 15 years’ work. Greenstone
approached the World Bank with a plan to plant bamboo in the short
run to hold erosion, then slower-growing teak for long—term sustain-
ability, giving timber rights to the locals. World Bank officials have
been ”very receptive.” Without spending anything, the company won
an award for its initiative from a Costa Rican foundation and a pop
song was written about Greenstone and the project. Now, as the min-
ing firm plans a major partnership venture in Panama, it is being seen
as a company that cares.

 

 

 

CANADIAN FOREST COMPANIES FIGHTING BAD IMAGE

The Financial Post reported last December that the Canadian forest
industry is in the midst of ”a major public relations crisis.” In British
Columbia, where forestry is the N o. 1 industry, a recent poll showed
that almost half of all citizens wanted logging of mature timber halted,
even if it means fewer jobs and higher prices for forest products. The
September issue of National Geographic did not help matters. Alongside
a three—page pullout photograph of Mount Paxton on Vancouver Island
-— stripped of its timber — was an admission by the article’s author
that logging practices on the island are the worst he’s ever seen. Some
big forestry firms are also talking about their supposed environmental
concern in PR campaigns that are plainly backfiring. Writes Vancouver-
based public affairs consultant James Hoggan, the author of the Post
article: ”Public relations campaigns that focus on a company’s commit-
ment to the environment instead of what the company or industry is
doing to improve its operations are destined to fail. The Canadian pub-
lic has grown weary of environmental policy statements...” The largest
B.C. forestry company, MacMillan Bloedel, was taking another tack last
winter. CEO Ray Smith appeared in TV commercials making what
Hoggan calls ”a plain-folks appeal for better dialogue on forestry
issues.” Smith told the people of BC. his company is willing to listen
and change.

GOVERNMENTS PURCHASING RECYCLED PRODUCTS

According to an article in Business Marketing last November, govern-
ment agencies at the federal, state, and local levels are purchasmgrecy-
cled products in large quantities, stimulating the market. The National
Institute of Government Purchasing estimates that roughly one-fifth of
the GNP can be attributed to government purchases. As of last fall, 39
of the states and the District of Columbia had policies favoring recy-
cled goods and were creating guidelines for their purchasing agents.
The EPA is the key federal agency issuing guidelines. Over the past
two years it has written guidelines for paper products, building insula-
tion, re-treaded tires, and re-refined motor oil. Any federal agency that
buys $10,000 or more per year of these products must buy items that
meet EPA standards for recovered-material content. These guidelines
also push state and local agencies that get federal procurement funds to
buy recycled products. Several states have ”price preference” for recy-
cled goods. Missouri, for example, allows state buyers to pay 10%
more; Nebraska’s governor has mandated his state to buy recycled
whenever possible without concern for price differentials. Nebraska
now spends its entire $1.7 million paper budget on recycled paper.
Missouri has passed a law that specifies all its paper must have a mini—
mum 25% recycled fiber content by 1993-94; 60% by the year 2000.
Other initiatives: 0 The Local Government Commission, a non-
profit group that promotes environmental responsibility among
California’s elected officials, has seen interest in recycled products
”skyrocket.” 0 The US. Conference of Mayors, a Washington—based
organization, has a ”Buy Recycled!” program to encourage members to
revise municipal procurement policies. In the first two months of the
program, 35 cities expressed interest. 0 The city of Chicago is rehabili—
tating 630 playgrounds using lumber made from recycled soft drink
bottles, detergent bottles, and milk jugs. 0 The most common products
purchased by municipalities and companies: copier paper, re—treaded
tires, printing paper, plastic lumber, toilet paper, re-refined oils, paper-
board boxes, drain pipe, computer paper, fiberboard drums, plastic
pallets, rubberized asphalt, concrete containing fly ash, and dry felt.

 

 

 

GARBAGE AND RAILROADS: NO BIG PAYOFF, YET

The New York Times reported last December that the anticipated oppor-

have not perfected their equipment; rail executives are unfamiliar with
the market; truckers have provided stiff competition; and local opposi-
tlon to the big dumps has been predictably tenacious (a November bal—
lot mitiative in South Dakota forced developers to halt construction of
a megadump). On the side of opportunity: Conrail expects its solid—
waste revenues to reach $40 to $50 million per year by 1994 and has
increased its stake in a waste management firm to develop disposal
Sites; Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. plans a joint venture

GRASSROO'I'S TOXICS MOVEMENT GE'I'I'ING POTENT

The Winter issue of Amicus foumal featured an article about the mount-
ing inﬂuence of grassroots environmental activism in the United States,
particularly local groups that oppose toxic waste. Two national organi-
zations stand at the forefront of thousands of small special interest
groups: The Citizen’s Clearinghouse for Hazardous Wastes (CCHW)
has 13 staffers, offices in seven states, an annual budget of over
$700,000, and a network of over 6,000 citizens’ groups that are anti—
toxic —— usually fighting to close leaking landfills or stop proposed
incinerators. The National Toxics Campaign (N TC) has over 10,000
members, 16 full-time staff members, nine offices, and an annual bud-
get of $1.9 million. '

Grassroots groups at the local level tend to be organized by
women, many of them with children suffering from pollution-related
ailments. They are typically vocal, determined, and, these days, suc-
cessful. Kansas housewife Lauri Maddy is a case in point. She believed
Wichita’s Vulcan Chemical plant was causing health problems in her
family, so she handcuffed herself to a chair in Kansas Governor Mike
Hayden’s office until he agreed to see her. The following week Vulcan
announced the cancellation of a proposed waste incinerator.

The most significant recent change in the grassroots toxics
movement has been its newfound solidarity — the amalgamation of
isolated struggles into a broad national network. CCHW, NTC, and the
environmental group Greenpeace, which has been reaching out to
grassroots activists as a key strategy, all work to put local groups in
touch with each other to share experiences and information.

Some examples of grassroots effectiveness: 0 In June of 1990,
representatives of 30 grassroots groups signed a letter demanding an
investigation of the EPA’s Region VI office in Dallas, which had appar-
ently ignored citizens affected by dioxin pollution and awarded a
Superfund Technical Assistance Grant (TAG) to a “citizens’ group”
funded by Hercules, Inc., one of the polluters in question. EPA admin-
istrator William Reilly has since revised the entire TAG program to
make money more accessible to grassroots organizations. 0 Prior to
giving up on polystyrene, McDonald’s Corp. had announced a large
recycling effort, largely in response to CCHW’s ”McToxics” campaign.
0 A film, made by a Greenpeace collaborator about a small Kentucky
town where 20 million pounds of toxic wastes were released and can-
cer rates are now almost twice the national average, led to a state crack—
down. 0 And last September, N TC announced a landmark agreement
with a California food distributor and supermarket chains in the US.
and Canada. The stores agreed to ask suppliers to disclose all pesti-
cides used on food and to encourage growers to phase out 64 pesticides
considered potentially carcinogenic.

The 1989 passing of the Emergency Planning and Community
Right-to-Know law has been important. Under congressional mandate,
companies are required to provide annual toxic release inventories to
the EPA. Emission reports from more than 19,000 manufacturing facili-
ties can be accessed by the public via a personal computer. The law has
forced many companies — prodded by people living near the plants
(and major environmental groups) — to rethink their practices.

JOHNSON 8: JOHNSON'S PEA'I' MOSS SANITARY NAPKIN

peat moss, processed using its patented technology, can absorb 20
times its weight in liquid. The company processes the peat moss at a
mill in Desbiens, Quebec, a small town 225 miles north of Montreal.
The region is rich in blueberries and peat bogs. One hitch: the dark peat
moss core is visible through the pad’s white outer lining, which could
make the already difficult task of getting women to try a new sanitary

LOW-POLLU'I'ION STEEL

Researchers in the United States and other countries are experimenting
with a radical concept known as ”direct steelmaking.” According to an
article in The Baltimore Sun last November, the goal is to condense the
three stages involved in making steel into one process that requires less
energy and emits far fewer pollutants. At the moment, steel is made by
superheating coal in an oven to produce coke, which creates huge vol-
umes of dust and gases. The coke is then mixed with iron ore and lime—
stone in a blast furnace to create pig iron. The pig iron is sent to an oxy-
gen furnace and mixed with more limestone and other compounds to
form molten steel. The direct process mixes all ingredients at once in a
sealed furnace that achieves temperatures as high as 3 OOOOF which
consume almost all polluting gases. However, engineers have yet to
control the chemical reactions of the furnace, and commercial direct
iteelénakmg is still a long way off. The Japanese, who have committed
un reds of milhons of dollars to the idea, are already making “direct

assets, despite offering interest rates that were 1% to 1.5% lower than
other German banks. It also had 11 million marks of equity capital from
altruistic shareholders who waived dividend payments, allowing the
bank to use the money to cover operating costs. But there’s a problem.
Okobank has grown faster than its staff of 18 are able to manage. At the
time of the article, it was having difficulty finding environmentally
worthy borrowers and had only lent 25 million marks. Surplus funds
had been put into the capital markets, where, presumably, they had

MICROWAVING MEDICAL WASTE

In the Nov/ Dec issue of EcoSource we mentioned a new system for
treating infectious medical waste using microwaves. A story in The
Tennessean last November elaborated. The process works this way: The
waste is shredded, sprayed with steam, then heated with microwaves
until all micro-organisms have been killed. Waste volume is decreased
by more than 85% and the final product can be landfilled safely. The
system is marketed by ABB Sanitec Inc., a US. unit of Asea Boveri
Brown. The first one to operate in the United States was purchased by
Forsyth Memorial Hospital, a 926-bed hospital in Winston-Salem,
North Carolina. Like many other medical facilities, Forsyth was faced
with having to build an incinerator that was strongly opposed by local
residents. The microwave unit muted the citizenry (nothing is emitted
into the air) and will save the hospital over $200,000 in annual disposal
costs. The hospital had been spending $270,000 per year to have its
infectious wastes trucked in refrigerated units to a special medical-
waste incinerator. Manufactured in Germany, the microwave unit sells
for (US) $500,000 to $600,000 and can be set on wheels for sharing
between hospitals. Along with North Carolina, California has
approved its use and it is being considered in New Jersey, Ohio, New
York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Hospitals faced with
having to install expensive pollution control equipment on existing
incinerators are also showing interest.

 

 

 

 

MICROWAVING RADIOACTIVE WASTE

An item in The New York Times, also from last November, reported that
microwave technology is being used to concentrate and solidify highly
radioactive liquid waste for disposal. The liquid is first heated and
reduced to a sludge by steam, then bombarded with high-frequency,
high-strength microwaves which render it molten so it can be poured
into steel drums. No gasification occurs because the hot sludge is kept
below 3500B Once in the drums, it cools in a crystalline—solid form that
can be stored more safely than liquid waste.

 

 

 

 

SQUEEZING AND SPRAYING TO SAVE LANDFILL SPACE

Given siting restrictions and NIMBYism, landfills are valuable real
estate these days. So it makes sense to stretch their holding capacities.
Two new ideas have emerged lately. In its Ian/ Feb 1991 issue,
Harrowsmith (Canadian version) mentioned a mobile metal baler that
compacts cars, appliances, and other metal trash for easy transport and
recycling. The unit can be driven to a site on a truck, used then moved
to another site, making it cost efficient for municipalities that normally
bury their metal waste. Made in Italy, the baler costs (CDN) $500,000-

0 Last December, The New York Times reported that spray foams can
replace $011 as a medium for covering layers of trash in landfills. Less
bulky, the foams, made by 3M and Rusmar Inc., are sprayed over
garbage to keep odor and vermin down until more garbage arrives.

RECYCLING AIRCRAFT ENGINES

In a presentation made last year to the American Society of Engineers,
two European university professors suggested that old aircraft engines
no longer able to meet noise regulations should not be scrapped but

OLD TIRES PROPOSED FOR RANCH FENCING

According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Don Triebwasser, a buffalo
breeder with a ranch near Cotton, Minnesota, wanted to use over 7,000
old tires to create a corral fence. The tires would be elevated about one
foot off the ground in a swampy corner of his property, an arrangement
he says would avoid corrosion that might lead to groundwater contam-
ination. Triebwasser also proposed lining the fence with 2,000 pine
trees. But neighbors, fearing water problems from deteriorating tires,

shell to form. The inventors have started a company — Concept RKK

recycled are thrown away because of the labels affixed to them.
According to The Wall Street Iourmil, Adhesives Research of Glen Rock,
Pennsylvania has solved the problem with a long-adhering, water-
soluble, non-contaminating glue for labels. The company is also selling
bulk rolls of paper label material backed with the glue.

REFORES‘I‘ING 'I'I'IE SAHARA

A Spanish inventor, Antonio Ibanez, has come up with an ingenious if
unlikely idea for reforesting deserts: ”planting” thousands of plastic
palm trees. According to an item in the December 1990 issue of
Earthwatch, Ibanez’s life-size polypalms absorb —— in honeycombed
trunks —- condensation that forms during cool desert nights, then
release it slowly into the atmosphere during the heat of the day. This
causes a temperature drop which produces rain. The rain nurtures a
real forest. Mauritania, Morocco, and Algeria are interested. Libya has
committed to planting 40,000 plastic trees.

 

 

SOLAR-POWERED LAWN MOWER

Lawnmower repairman Anthony Paytas of Warren, Michigan has
developed a solar-powered lawnmower that will cut for two hours
with energy derived from 3.4 square feet of photovoltaic panels.
Mentioned in The Globe and Mail, the mower, called Solar 1, runs 33%
faster than most gas mowers, cuts a 21—inch swath, and is “whisper-
quiet.” It will cost about $600, but requires far less maintenance than
gas mowers and no fuel (it can be recharged in a wall socket). Paytas is
talking to manufacturers and hopes to market Solar l in 1992.

 

 

 

 

LINKING FARM MACHINERY TO SATELLITES ﬂ

Sensible Agriculture reported in its January issue that it is now feasible
to put farm equipment in touch with Earth-circling satellites to make
more efficient use of fertilizers, pesticides, and other field applications.
The idea, which was demonstrated last summer at Montana State uni—
ver51ty, relies on the Global Positioning System navigational satellite
network, which is also used by ships at sea. A computer on board a
tractor equipped with a video screen takes signals from the satellites to
show the farmer his exact position within his fields (accuracy: six to 12
feet). The computer can trigger application equipment dispensing
chemicals at a rate that matches the precise soil characferistics thus
av01d1ng over-application. Savings are estimated at $5 to $20 I er acre
The systems cost cost $40,000 but should drop to $5,000 by 19196. .

NATURAL SYSTEMS FOR WASTE PURIFICATION

Using micro-organisms and plants to cleanse wastewater or render
efﬂuents less offensive is not a new idea, but it’s one that’s gaining
ground. Such systems are attractive on at least two counts: they are
drastically less expensive to buy and operate than conventional high-
tech alternatives, and they usually have less impact on the environ-
ment. Three recent reports show the progress being made:

0 The Christian Science Monitor reported last February that the
Massachusetts town of Harwich is experimenting with a natural sys-
tem, designed by John Todd (founder of the Falmouth, Massachusetts-
based Center for the Protection and Restoration of Waters) for treating
septic-tank waste — a concentrated waste that is often dumped illegal—
ly on the ground. Ordered by the state to close its septic lagoons by
1992 because its sandy soils and high water table make groundwater
contamination likely, Harwich doesn’t want to invest millions in a
treatment plant. Todd’s system, which presently treats about 30% of the
town’s sewage, uses bacteria and plants to do the work. The ”septage”
is pumped from trucks through rows of 600-gallon Plexiglas tanks
inside a greenhouse. Aerated, the tanks teem with bacteria, algae, and
sludge-eating snails while water hyacinths ﬂoat on the surface and
small trees form extensive root systems in sediment on the bottom.
From the tanks the water is drained slowly through an engineered
“marsh”— a narrow trough of gravel, grasses, and small ﬂowers, then
further ”polished” in more tanks and marshes until it is is clean
enough to put back into the ground. The town pays 15 cents per gallon
to Ecological Engineering Associates, the firm that owns and operates
the system. Although the system has not been entirely stabilized, it is
superior to most outdated sewage plants and better than many new
ones, according to Environmental Engineering. A full system, able to
serve a town like Harwich (300,000 summer residents), would be one-
third to one-half the price of a conventional septic-treatment system. A
nearby town recently spent $15 million on conventional treatment.

0 The Christchurch Press, of New Zealand, reported last
November on a novel sewage-treatment scheme. The North Island city
of Rotorua used to pump its treated sewage into a local lake. But nitro-
gen and phosphorous levels began to threaten the lake, and treated
effluents were not up to required standards. Now, through a network
of buried pipelines and sprinklers, Rotorua is irrigating a nearby pine
forest reserve with the efﬂuent. As it percolates down through forest
litter and quick-draining volcanic soils, the efﬂuent is cleansed by natu-
ral bacterial action. The nitrogen and phosphorous aid forest growth.

0 The Environment Digest reported last October that ICI (the
English chemical firm) has built seven large reed beds beside its
Billingham chemical plant, one of Europe’s largest. The roots of the
reeds, which contain naturally occurring bacteria, transform toxic fac-
tory efﬂuent into a benign solution. Although the efﬂuent is already
highly diluted, it contains amines, a byproduct of plastic manufactur-
ing. The 12 acres of reed beds can process 3,000 tons of the amine-
efﬂuent per day. Formerly, it was discharged straight into a river.

"'I'RANSGENIC" CO'I'I‘ON

According to reports in The Wall Street Journal and the Louisville Courier-
Journal, genetically engineered cotton proved, in tests last summer, that
it can deter caterpillars as effectively as synthetlc insecticid es.
Developed by Monsanto Co. and tested in conjunctlon With the U .8.
Dept. of Agriculture, the cotton plants have within them a gene ta ken
from a bacterium that is the natural enemy of many cotton-d estroying
caterpillars, including the tobacco budworm, the cotton bollworm, and
the pink bollworm. In tests at Mississippi State University, unsprayed
transgenic plants were exposed to artificially high concentrations of
budworms yet managed to produce the same amount of cotton as
plants that were sprayed weekly. The caterpillars died after taking one
or two bites of the transgenic cotton. Unfortunately, the protein pro-
duced by the engineered cotton has no effect on the infamous boll
weevil. A successful insecticide-producing cotton plant would be a
great asset to cotton producers and the environment. Cotton crops
account for nearly half the chemical insecticides used annually in the
United States. About 15 million pounds of insecticides are applied each
year, costing roughly $230 million. 0 An Associated Press report from
last January mentioned a genetically engineered potato being devel-
oped by Monsanto that kills the Colorado potato beetle, a scourge of
East Coast vegetable farmers. The plant will be tested this yea r.

 

 

 

MIXED-PAPER/VEGETABLE-FIBER BUILDING PANEL

According to an article in Resource Recycling last January, a Belgian—
developed building panel made from mixed paper and vegetable fibers
(such as wheat straw or rice husks) holds a great deal of promise for
the North American market. Called Pan Terre (Earth Panel), it has
excellent acoustical and thermal insulating properties and is created
without the use of glues or chemical binding agents — the mixed
papersand vegetable fibers bind together firmly under heat and pres—
sure. Fifty percent of the panel is paper. Of that, commonly, 80% is old
newsprint, 10% old magazines, and 10% used corrugated cardboard.
Junk mail and office paper also qualify. The paper is chopped and
mixed 1n a slurry with an equal measure of natural fiber. Wheat straw
and rice husks are used most frequently, but peanut shells, coffee bean
hulls, and sugar cane pulp also work well, making the technologv ideal
for developing nations. In Europe, Pan Terre comes in 14 product lines
and IS used for-everything from soundproofing floors and walls to
sheathing moblle- and pre-fab homes. Potential uses include suspend-
ed ceilingsgkitchen cabinets, furniture, and point-of—purchase displays.
Because of its obvious environmental advantages over gypsum d ry—
wall, Pan Terre is also being tested successfully as a wallboard. It has

AN ”INDUS'I'RIAI. ECOSYS'I'EM" IN DENMARK

Two ideas gaining ground these days — the trading of wastes and the
reclaiming of surplus energy — are being practised with remarkable success
in an industrial park near Kalundborg, 80 miles from Copenhagen. The busi-
nesses involved are the multinational enzyme and pharmaceuticals maker

N ovo N ordisk, an oil refiner named Statoil, the wallboard manufacturer
Gyproc, and the Asnaes power station, Denmark’s largest coal—burning plant.
According to an article in the Financial Times (England) last December, the
waste-and-energy co-operative was inspired by a group of students from a
local school who toured the industrial park as part of an environmental pro-
ject. They made a model that demonstrated some basic relationships that
could be formed among the businesses. The idea caught on.

The first deal was struck in the early 19805 when N ovo N ordisk
agreed to buy the power station’s surplus steam, which was being cooled and
released as wastewater. Next, the power station began re-using cooling water
from the refinery. Last fall it also began taking the refinery’s purified waste-
water. In 1993, N ovo N ordisk will be required by law to purify more of its
wastewater, which the power station will also take, since fresh water is in
short supply around Kalundborg. By the end of this year, the power company
will buy all the refinery’s excess gas, which currently gets burnt off through a
flare stack. This arrangement will mean 30,000 fewer tons of coal burned each
year and the refinery’s flare stack will be reduced from a raging torch to a
flickering pilot light. In turn, surplus heat from the power station gets chan-
neled into the municipality’s district heating system, which has allowed the
closure of more than 3,500 residential home oil burners. The story goes on.
Sludge from a fish farm operated by the power company is fertilizing local
farm fields. The farmers are also getting a nitrogen-rich sludge that is a
byproduct of several N ovo N ordisk processes. This saves N ovo N ordisk con-
siderable dumping fees. Fly-ash from the power station is used in cement
making and road building. Sulfur from the refinery is used to make sulfuric
acid. And Gyproc is negotiating a price for crude gypsum that will be pro-
duced by a chimney scrubber the power station will install in 1993.

The initial motivation was economic, but lately the environmental
benefits have become obvious. ”N ow, we are looking for ways to improve the
environment, ” says Jorgen Christensen, a N ovo N ordisk vice president. ”We
find these initiatives can pay too.”

Christensen says he has not heard of a similar level of co-operation
between unrelated industries anywhere in the world. He also says there are
preconditions: Physical proximity is essential, because infrastructure must
often be installed. And it takes open-minded managers who have an under-
standing of the opportunities. As the article points out, mounting environ-
mental pressures on Danish industry have also been a factor at Kalundborg.

 

RALS'I'ON-PURINA: NEW GREEN FOODS FOR DOGS 8“ BABIES

The March issue of Green MarketAlert reports that Ralston Purina Co. of St.
Louis, Missouri, is introducing a new green dog food line, called N ature’s
Course, based on pesticide-free wheat. Containing no artificial ﬂavors or col-
oring, N ature’s Course will be advertised nationwide in a $40 million cam-
paign. Also, Beech-Nut, a Ralston-Purina subsidiary and the second-largest
baby food maker in the United States (next to Gerber Products Co.), is about
to introduce an organic baby food — Beech N ut’s Special Harvest. Limited
availability of organic produce will restrict marketing to five regions.

l—CT MAKES A GLOBAL COMMITMENT

Last December, according to a Financial Times story (and our interview with
John Elkington in the Ian/ Feb ECOSOurce), ICI Chairman Sir Denys Henderson
took the extraordinary step of writing a personal letter to 13,4,000 employees
worldwide, informing them of the giant chemical company s envrronmental
objectives. 1C1 has also become one of the first companies in the UK to link
the compensation of its managers to environmental performance. Henderson
has committed to doubling ICI’s environment—related spending to £1 billion
over the next five years, which will account for about 20% Of all. planned capi-
tal expenditures. The company’s four key environmental ob]ectives: 0 All
new plants throughout the world will be built to meet the regulations of the
most environmentally demanding country in which ICI operates (probably
the Netherlands, Germany, or the United States). 0 The company will reduce
its waste output by 50% by 1995, paying special attention to hazardous
wastes. 0 It will step up its energy conservation efforts, attempting to make a
50% overall gain in five years. 0 And recycling systems will be put in place
this year, both in-house and for customers to recycle 1C1 products and pack-
aging. Henderson has vowed that 1C1 plants that cannot be cleaned up
affordably will be shut down. The general opinion of the chemical industry is
that 1C1 trails its three big German competitors —— BASF, Bayer, and Hoechst
—— when it comes to environmental performance. Greenpeace UK feels lCl
could be doing more. It points to Du Font and Monsanto in the United States,
which have set emissions reductions goals of 70% for the 19905.

 

NEW WASTE SYSTEM MAY CLEAN UP THE CEMENT BUSINESS

New Scientist reported in March that a cement factory, owned by Dragon
Products, in Thomaston, Maine, is using an amazing new process that allows
it to recycle its own waste, cut its emissions to almost nothing, and produce
fertilizer as a byproduct. Cement is made by ”roasting” limestone (calcium
carbonate) and sand (silica, potassium, and alumina). The final product is
mostly calcium silicate. The chief waste product is cement kiln dust (CKD), a
fine powder of calcium-sulfur compounds, potassium oxide, and some heavy
metals. Like many cement operations, the Dragon Products plant has been
stockpiling its waste in a large mound, With no prospect of permanent dis-
posal. Many plants dump their CKD into their limestone quarries and simply
close the operation down when they fill up. Now, with Dragon’s new $12
million recovery scrubber system, the chemicals in the dust and the gases
from the kiln combine to form usable substances. It works this way: The
CKD, mixed with water to form a slurry, is combined with kiln ash and
exhaust gases, which contain sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen
oxides. The sulfur from the sulfur dioxides and the calcium—sulfur com-
pounds combine with the potassium in the CKD to make potassium sulfate, a
valuable fertilizer. The calcium combines with the carbon dioxide to produce

3M STII.I. LEADS NATION IN ANTI-POLLUTION TACTICS

The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company is cited in endless
media reports for its comprehensive environmental strategy, and for the
profits it has earned since 1975 through its Pollution Prevention Pays (3P)
program — over $500 million — mainly by altering processes to avoid the
creation of wastes that would otherwise have to be treated. An article in The
New York Times in early February updated 3M’s accomplishments:

Best known for its Scotch brand tapes, sandpaper, Post-It Notes, and
other adhesive-based consumer products, 3M is still a polluter of great mag-
nitude. Many of its thousands of products are made by putting a thin layer of
something suspended in solvent onto a base material, then driving the sol-
vent off with heat. According to EPA data, 3M is the nation’s largest emitter
of chemicals suspected of causing birth defects, such as the volatile organics
methyl ketone and toluene. Data from 1988 show that the company emitted a
total of 61.3 million pounds of toxics, 52.8 million of them linked to birth
defects. In 1989, 3M says its total emissions jumped to 72.6 million pounds.

On the other hand, its emissions target for 1993 is only 20 million
pounds. 3M has been credited by some environmentalists and most financial
analysts for doing an admirable job of systematically cleaning up its opera-
tions and integrating an exacting environmental ethic into all layers of man-
agement and production. ”They are one of the few companies that have been
doing the right thing for years,” says activist Barry Commoner, director of the
Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at New York’s Queens College.
”They understand that the way to prevent pollution is to eliminate the pro-
duction of toxic materials.” The Franklin Research and Development
Corporation, a Boston-based investment firm that rates companies on social
responsibility, has given 3M its highest ranking.

Some other 3M strategies: 0 The company will invest $150 million by
1993 in air pollution control equipment, cutting emissions by 70% to 75% of
1987 levels. The target by the year 2000 is 90%, with hazardous wastes com-
ing down by half in the same period. 0 In an extraordinary move, 3M is also
forfeiting, rather than selling, its federal pollution-reduction credits from fac-
tories around the country, arguing that this will eliminate pollution instead of
simply transferring the right to pollute to other companies. Among 3M’s
credits so far, for example, are 1,000 pounds per day of organic solvents in the
Los Angeles area, valued at more than $1 million on the open market, accord-
ing to people who broker pollution rights. 3M is the only major firm that has
made credit-forfeiting a policy. 0 The company is using its progressive envi-
ronmental policy as a competitive tool. Example: Bulk videotape is sold in
large rolls and shipped in plastic foam packaging. The used packaging is col-
lected at customers’ plants and re-used by 3M, an advantage over Japanese or
Korean competitors. 0 3M has, for years, cleaned up its operations in advance
of federal or state regulations. Example: It will dig up all underground stor-
age tanks and replace them with above-ground tanks by 1992. The govern-
ment’s deadline is 1998. 0 Meeting environmental goals has become part of
the criteria for annual executive performance reviews that determine pay
increases and other benefits. 0 It is also policy at 3M that 25% of sales in each
division come from products introduced in the last five years. This has made
it easier to install pollution-control equipment since processes are continually
revamped.

Says Alfred Marcus, an associate professor at the University of
Minnesota’s School of Management: ”[3M doesn’t] do these things because
they are in love with nature. They do it because it is smart.”

ELAROID'S ”ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOUNTING" SYSTEM

Polaroid Corp. has announced it will eliminate 50% of its toxic emissions by
1995, reducing 10% per year (based on 1988 figures) through its Tox1c Use .
and Waste Reduction program. The program relies on an'in-house measurmg
system called the Environmental Accounting and Reporting System (E ARS),
According to Business Ethics magazine, Polar01d uses EARS to rank sub-
stances by their risk to the environment, then focuses on the most hazardous
ones. The company monitors success in each of its d1ViSions and rewards 1ts
managers, or chooses not to reward them, based on performance. Apparently
the program is working. First year reductions exceeded ll %.

 

CORPORATIONS SET UP PAYROLL ECOLOGY DONATIONS

Also from Business Ethics: Three California—based companies, Apple
Computer (Cupertino), Gap (San Bruno), and Safeway Stores (Oakland), have
set up payroll programs that allow employees to make regular donations to
environmental groups. The money is handled by the San Francisco-based
Environmental Federation of California, which has been called an “environ—

have ecological payroll-deduction programs administered through the
Environmental Federation of America in Washington, DC.

 

P&G, GIANT FOOD, SIERRA CLUB ”CLOSING THE LOOP"

Once a recycling infrastructure is in place, with collection, reprocessing, and
end-user markets, all that remains is to motivate the public. In a program
announced last January and reported in Green Ma rkctAIert, Procter & Gamble,
Giant Food, Polysource Mid-Atlantic (a plastics reprocessor), the Potomac
chapter of the Sierra Club, two television stations, and various government
authorities are encouraging people to recycle in Washington, DC with a pro-
gram called ”Closing The Loop.” Funded by P&C and the two TV stations,
“Closing the Loop” will attempt to teach the value and mechanics of recy-
cling through TV commercials and curriculum additions to home economics
classes within the Maryland Department of Education. Along with enhancing
its image, P&G wants to cultivate a steady supply of recyclable PET and
HDPE plastics. The company intends to be involved in similar programs else-
where in the US. and has expressed the hope that other consumer—goods
firms will consider sponsorships, even arch-rival Lever Brothers. (

ate air conditioning, space heating, water heating, lights, and appliances from
a bank of batteries located along a wall in the garage. The batteries are fed by
solar panels manufactured by Kyocera America, Inc. Priced at $179,000, the
home need not be hooked up to the local municipal grid, and its energy sys-
tem costs about half of what a similar solar system was selling for only three
years ago. 0 From the same issue of In Business: The Arizona Department of

CANADIAN UTILITY FIRST WITH KRYPTON-BUI-B REBATES

Krypton light bulbs, which operate like regular incandescent bulbs but are
filled with krypton gas rather than argon, could. become a new efficiency tool
for utilities if a rebate program by New Brunswick l’ower succeeds 1“ ”S 8031
to cut energy consumption. According to an article in the F IIIHIICIH] Post last
January, krypton bulbs, which have been around Since World War ll, need
only 52 watts to provide the same light as a standard 60-watt bulb —— roughly
a 14% saving —- and they last twice as long. While they are nowhere nearas
efficient as the compact ﬂuorescent bulbs being sponsored by many utilities
(see ”Demand-Side Management” in this issue), they are also nowhere near
as expensive. In Canada, a compact ﬂuorescent bulb costs between $20 and
$25. While some North American utilities, like San Diego Gas and Electric in
California, are purchasing compact ﬂuorescents outright for customers,
Canadian utilities are so far only offering modest rebates. The country’s
largest utility, Ontario Hydro, for example, provides a $5 rebate per bulb.
Krypton bulbs cost only $1 apiece and New Brunswick Power has been offer-
ing a 37-cent rebate for each one purchased. Between last September and
December 3lst, 800,000 were sold in its territory, representing (1.4 megawatts
of saved energy if all were installed. While that’s a small fraction of the utili-
ty’s peak demand of 2,500 MW, it does ease the pressure to build a new fossil-
fuel generating station. New Brunswick’s program appears to be the only one
of its kind in North America. The Post says it is being watched closely by
other utilities. Sylvania, which manufactures both krypton and com pact fluo—
rescent bulbs, is refitting a plant in Drummond ville, Quebec to handle what it
believes will be a surge in demand for krypton bulbs.

ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP I.ABEI.ING ”SMART WOOD”

Audubon Activist reported in February that a New York-based environmental
group has launched a program to certify and label tropical woods that are
harvested responsibly. Rainforest Alliance will award “Smart Wood” certifi-
cates to companies selling wood from timber firms that: maintain watershed
stability and control erosion; practice sustainable-yield forestry; and exert a
positive impact on the community where the wood originates. The idea is to
encourage consumers to look for the label and have companies that use it see
it as a marketing benefit, thereby insisting that their suppliers harvest respon-
sibly. A Rainforest Alliance spokesman says the Smart Wood program is “the
beginning of a long process to make industry more responsible about the infor-
mation it provides.” 0 According to the Winter 1991 issue of Design Spirit, the
International Timber Trade Organization, in consultation with Friends of the
Earth (UK) and other organizations doing rainforest research, is developing
world guidelines for sustainable forestry practices. The magazine also noted that
Herman Miller Inc., a large US. manufacturer of office furniture, will now use
only sustained-yield wood in its standard furniture lines. Herman Miller is still
trying to work out definitions and verification procedures but has already
dropped a number of tropical wood suppliers. 0 The Brundtland Bulletin
(September / December) reports that a British specialty merchant — Ecological
Trading Company, of N ewcastle-upon-Tyne — cannot keep up with the demand
for its sustainably harvested tropical timber. The company pays about 15% more
to acquire certified woods, a premium that has not discouraged buyers.

 

TREES, TREES, TREES

Tree planting continues to be one of the cheapest, most effortless, and least
controversial ways for corporations and governments to display their envi-
ronmentalism — except in the case of General Mills, which has incurred more
than its share of controversy with a recent TV commercial for Lucky Charms
breakfast cereal. According to The Wall Street Iournal, the commercial is part of
a green campaign that awards a seedling to anyone who purchases two boxes
of Lucky Charms. The controversy involves the brand’s mascot, Lucky
Leprechaun, who prances into the woods to hide marshmallow bits only to
find that the woods are gone, reduced to a field of stumps. The implication is
that whoever cut down the trees didn’t replant new ones. Loggers are livid.
The publisher of Loggers World magazine has referred to the ad as ”ambush
commercialism,” and dozens of loggers have conveyed their outrage to the
General Mills headquarters in Minneapolis. The cereal company insists that
no offense was intended, it simply wanted to express ”general concern.”
Other trees in the news: 0 According to Good Housekeeping, Indianapolis,
Indiana, will plant a tree for every baby born in the city this year, more than
14,000 in all. 0 The state of Missouri, according to Citizen News Services, is
offering its residents a free tree in exchange for a yard-high stack of old news-
papers. The $500,000 program is being funded with a slice of the $42 million
Missouri received from Exxon Corp., which was convicted of exceeding price
controls. The newspapers will become home insulation. 0 A number of US.
magazines are taking the ”Green Pages” pledge —— promising to replace the
trees they consume through their use of paper by planting seedlings each
time an issue is published. Magazines involved so far: Business Ethics,
Building Economic Alternatives, E Magazine, Earth Island ]ournal (which initiated
the plan), Greenpeace Magazine, In Context, New Age Iournal, and Utne Reader.
Invitations will be extended to Time, Newsweek, and The New York Times.

FUR FLYING

Stung by animal-rights activists, the fur industry is beginning to fight back
with advertisements and other public relations gestures. The Wall Street
Journal reported in January that Saga, a Scandinavian fur producers’ coopera-
tive, recently launched a US. ad campaign encouraging people to exercrse
their ”freedom of choice.” One ad shows several smiling, maternal-looking
women holding children and wearing fur. Saga says the ads are “non—com-
bative.” The Fur Information Council of America, on the other hand, has
come out with guns blazing. In ads developed by Burson-Marsteller, the
trade group lists illegal or suspicious acts committed by animal-rights groups
like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

 

BFI SPONSORING STUDENTS OF SOLID WASTE

The January issue of Waste Age describes a novel program sponsored by
Azusa Land Reclamation Co., a subsidiary of Browning Ferris Industries of
Houston. The company, which operates a landfill in Azusa, California near
LA, is paying students from UCLA’s solid waste management program to
study Azusa’s solid waste stream by sorting through trash. The program fits
a new state law (AB 939) that requires that all California communities study
their waste before creating mandatory solid waste reduction programs. The
Azusa work will yield comprehensive data and management models for it
and other communities at a low cost. BFI’s investment will give it access to
the top students in a business where qualified people are in short supply.

 

HYDROGEN-FUELED BUS FIRST TEST OF ENERGY' S FUTURE

The province of British Columbia and the Canadian federal government are
funding an important test of the Ballard hydrogen fuel cell — one of the
world’s most promising hydrogen-energy technologies. The Vancouver
Province reported last November that (CDN) $4.8 million will be spent over
three years testing the cell in a small city bus that will emit only warm water
from its tail pipe. The cell’s creator — Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver —-
has drawn international attention to itself with the compact, high-energy fuel
cell, which is also being evaluated by clients in the US, Germany, and Japan.

 

WOODWASTE POWER PLANT A FIRST IN BRITISH COLUMBIA

Also from the Vancouver Province: An independent energy firm will construct
and operate British Columbia’s first private-sector power—generating plant
fueled with woodwaste. The $135-million plant will generate 55 megawatts
f enough to power 45,000 homes. It will be built at Williams Lake in the
timber-rich northern interior of the province, replacing six ”beehive” burners
that currently burn woodwaste without reclaiming energy. The new plant
W111 start up in 1993 and consume 600,000 tons of waste annually, emitting far
fewer particles, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons than the beehives.

WORLDWATCH ANNUAL REPORT CALLS FOR GREEN TAXES

The Worldwatch Institute, a private research organization that monitors the
health of the Earth using various resource indicators, published its annual
State of the World report in February. According to an article in the Christian
Science Monitor, the news remains as bad as ever. A dominant message in the
1991 report is that economic prosperity of recent years has only masked envi-
ronmental degradation. The world is experiencing ”a disguised form of
deficit financing,” writes Worldwatch president Lester Brown. ”In sector after
sector, we are consuming our natural capital at an alarming rate.” Brown and
his group predicts the trend will eventually lead to economic collapse. Some
figures: Each year, the world is now losing 42 million acres of forest — an
area the size of Austria — and 24 billion tons of topsoil. Six billion tons of car-
bon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, enter the Earth’s atmosphere each
year. Furthermore, world population has started to rise after declining for
about 15 years. That puts an even greater strain on resources. Unlike
President Bush, who continues to favor fossil fuels, Worldwatch feels the time
has come to switch to renewable sources of energy, including solar, wind,
geothermal, biomass, and hydroelectric. (Recent studies done for the US.
Energy Department demonstrate that renewables could supply 50% to 70% of
all US. energy needs by the year 2030, plus create more jobs than traditional
fossil sources and sharply decrease emissions of C02.) Worldwatch also
advocates government imposition of heavy taxes on ”products and activities
that pollute, deplete or otherwise degrade natural systems,” including emis-
sions of carbon, sulfur dioxide, and nitrous oxides; pesticides; hazardous
wastes; paper from virgin pulp; and the overpumping of groundwater. The
group claims green taxes are a “way of ensuring that environmental costs are
taken into account in private decisions, such as whether to commute by car or
via mass transit,” and that they are in keeping with the free-market approach
favored by many economists. “Taxes help meet broad environmental goals
efficiently,” says the report, ”since they adjust prices and let the market do
the rest.” A variety of environmental taxes have been introduced in western
European countries lately and seem to be having the intended effect. In 1989,
for example, an 8% tax on leaded gasoline in Britain boosted the market share
for unleaded gasoline from 4% to 30% in one year.

 

NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL'S ”GAG ORDER”

According to an angry article in The Wall Street ]oarnal last January, the pow-
erful Washington-based environmental group National Resources Defense
Council tried to delay the publishing of results from a pesticide study done
by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley because they may
have provided California voters with information adverse to Proposition 128,
also called Big Green. The N RDC’s Albert Meyerhoff apparently wrote a let-
ter to the university’s president, David Gardner, and sent copies to its board
of regents and several politicians, claiming that the pesticide study was being
published ”on an expedited basis... prior to the election.” He called it a mis—
use of public funds. Subsequently, two state legislators wrote to Gardner and
insinuated that the university’s funding could be hampered if the study came
to light. The author of the [oarnal article, Gerald Sirkin, a retired professor of
economics, claims the N RDC’s move is ”further evidence that environmental
regulation is a scientific and economic issue that is being guided not by sci-
ence and economics but by the skills of street fighters in the back alleys of
politics, the courts, and the media.” N RDC has also been named in a multi-
million-dollar class-action suit by the apple industry for its instrumental role

in the Alar ”scare” of 1989.

STRATEGIES 8: INITIATIVES

 

DUTCH FARMERS TRYING DESPERATEI-Y TO REDUCE POOP

Our story on the Dutch Environmental Policy Plan (EcoSource, Nov / Dec)
mentioned that manure was one of the tiny country’s most pressing prob-
lems. An article in the Financial Times (England) last January elaborated.

Dutch farmers are victims of their own success. Through intensive
livestock husbandry, they have increased the pig population by 675% since
1950, to 14 million animals; the hen population by over 400%, to 93 million
birds; and the cow population 80%, to almost five million cows. Not includ-
ing ducks, the total is 112 million, in a country of 15 million people. The
resulting manure weighs about 80 million tons, 14 million of which is surplus
and cannot be used in the same province where it originates. Furthermore,
much of Holland’s soil is now saturated with minerals and cannot absorb the
high levels of phosphate in animal excrement, so an unacceptable amount of
it is seeping into groundwater. Ammonia — also plentiful in manure —— is
escaping into the air when the manure is spread on fields, then returning as
acid rain. Clearly, in Holland, poop is a prodigious problem.

The trouble is that agriculture is a booming and powerful industry.
The livestock sector alone generates annual sales of roughly (US) $7.5 billion.
And farmers do not want to give in to pressure from environmentalists who
advocate herd reductions. Working with large Dutch companies like DSM
and Gist—brocades, and foreign firms such as Finland’s Kemira and Italy’s
Ferruzzi, Dutch farmers are testing a number of possible solutions: 0 Farm
equipment is being designed that will inject manure into the soil rather than
simply spread it on top, thereby curtailing ammonia evaporation. 0 Gist-
brocades is working on a feed enzyme that will enable single-stomached crea-
tures like pigs to ”unlock” phosphorous compounds and digest more phos-
phorous. 0 DSM and Kemira are attempting to treat cattle manure with
nitrous acid to neutralize ammonia but not hinder the manure’s value as fer-
tilizer. 0 And a pilot plant that pelletizes manure for export is already pro-
cessing 100,000 tons a year. Two additional plants, each handling 600,000
tons, are slated for construction (although a strong NIMBY sentiment has
made siting difficult, despite their odorlessness). To illustrate the degree to
which farmers are willing to process poop, they convinced the monarch of
the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix, to pose for photographs sipping water that
had been recycled from pig manure. She was smiling. Sort of.

DUTCH STUDY PROPOSES ”RESTITUTIVE JUSTICE” FOR WILD ANIMALS

Earth Island [onrnaL in its Winter 1990 issue, mentioned a study from the
Center for Environmental Science at the Royal University of Leiden in the
Netherlands that recommends spending the equivalent of (US) $360 million
over the next 20 years to save Wildlife from Dutch highways. The money
would build 750 tunnels for badgers and martens, 50 passages for deer, and
numerous overhead crossings for squirrels and other mammals. The Leiden
study is the first to propose a nationwide application of ”restitutive justice.”
Holland has a surfeit of automobiles and is literally webbed with highways.

WINDMILLS KEY TO I'IOI.I.AND'S FAST AND FUTURE

The European reported in February that the Dutch government and various
prov1nc1al authorities are united behind the country’s most ambitious
windmill—building program in 300 years. As many as 3,000 metal Windmills
Wlll be installed alongside 1,000 traditional wooden windmills. They will

generate 1,000 megawatts of power by the year 2000, avoiding the need to
uild more foss11—fuel or nuclear generating stations.

ble hulls are the best way to prevent tankers from spilling oil. An alternative is
to double layer the walls, single layer the bottom of the ship, and create an air-
tight barrier in the cargo tank. This would hold the oil inside the tanker in the

CONSERVATION IN THE AGE OF DESERT STORM 7 i '

”Retail gasoline prices in some parts of the US. are now.(US) 97¢ a gal-
lon. Even with the new 5¢-a-gallon federal tax imposed 1n December, a
fill-up in the US. costs about half as much as it doesin some Canadian
cities, and only one—quarter what Germans will pay if the gasollne tax
proposed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl is approved.

At those rock-bottom prices, anyone who expects the market-
place to stimulate conservation might just as well ship tulip bulbs by
squirrel.

The current favorite Washington phrase for a policy with no
future is that it was dead on arrival. After 18 months in the making,

N ES (National Energy Strategy) never even uttered a word on the way.
What little breath it may have was smothered by environmentalists
who were opposed to exploration in the Arctic Wildlife Refuge.

And if there’s anything left after the ice-huggers are done, John
Dingell, chairman of the House committee on energy and commerce,
will snuff that out, too. Dingell, who represents a Michigan district and
is better known as the member for General Motors, was much of the
reason the Clean Air Act took a decade to become law.

Dingell will make sure legislators do nothing about vehicle
efficiency, an area of wretched excess consumption where the biggest
savings could be made. Current requirements, known as corporate
average fuel economy, demand that the complete ﬂeet produced by an
auto manufacturer average 27.5 miles per gallon.

That level took years of legislated activity and careful phase— (>
ins to attain. Proposals by consumer activist Ralph Nader and others to
increase those levels to 40 miles per gallon by the year 2001 have little
support. That’s regrettable because the reliance of Americans on oil is
staggering. In 1990, the U5. burned about 25% of total world consump-
tion. Worse, 42% of the oil used in the US. last year was imported, a
level that N ES says could hit 65% within two decades. Oil is so cheap
that natural gas use has actually fallen by 10% since 1970.

When it comes to energy policy, there are only two strategies
possible. The first takes the long-term view by combining higher user
taxes and resulting high prices with incentives for more domestic pro-
ductlon and a hunt for alternative sources. The second strategy is sim—
pler but short-sighted: low prices, continued imports. The Bush admin-
istration has chosen the latter course.

George Bush showed leadership in the Persian Gulf and he
could now prove that he’s more than just an order taker in the new
world order. HeOhas the clout to overcome all the special interest
groups and put In place an energy tax that’s large enough to encourage
serious conservatlon, promote exploration and make the US. less
rellant on foreign oil.
for 011 ariuch boldness, however, seems unlikely. The US. went to war

was v1ctorlous. Full stop. N 0 further action on the energy

front will be forthcoming For future se ' '

PEOPLE WANT GREENER PRODUCTS BUT WON’ T PAY

”Packagers frequently ask what kinds of environmental responsiveness
will consumers pay for and how much will they pay. The answer to
these questions is not what the askers want to hear.

Consumers don’t want to pay more at all for any kind of envi-
ronmental responsiveness. They probably won’t pay any more at the
point of purchase, even if they say they will in survey responses. That
is not to say consumers don’t care about packaging responses to envi-
ronmental problems. They do care — a lot.

Environmental friendliness and other social issues are reasons
consumers are likely to boycott or ”buycott” products. They are not
likely to pay a premium for an environmental benefit, but a perceived
advantage or credible claim will tilt their purchase decision toward a
product. The tilt will be felt as a strong push if everything else, espe-
cially price, is equal.”

Consumers think environmental improvements should take
place because it’s the right thing for companies to do. Feelings of social
responsibility are becoming more mainstream and real-world — less
idealistic and academic.

In addition, consumers are beginning to broaden their environ-
mental focus beyond packaging to include the products inside. The
idea of environmental eating is beginning to broaden its appeal. The
environmental component of packaging and products is going to be an
important part of business for the next few years.

Of course packagers can’t forget about convenience either.
Consumers still want it all if they can have it, but they are more willing
to shift to a different kind of convenience than to sacrifice it altogether.
Even though today’s primary packaging concerns are environmental
and consumers feel strongly that microwaveable entrees and dinners
are overpackaged, functionality and convenience remain factors in
their purchase behavior.

Consumers are perceiving environmental actions as consumer
responsiveness as well as social responsibility. Packagers will feel pres—
sure to respond in the long and short run.”

Mona Doyle, president of the Consumer Network, lnc., a research firm specializing in consumer products sold in
supermarkets, drugstores, and discount department stores, writing in Food & Drug Packaging, January, l99l.

 

 

 

GETTING GREEN INSIDE BEFORE GOING GREEN OUTSIDE

”Green is a process which requires a shift to systemic thinking patterns.
Before a company goes out touting the environmental benefits of its
products, it should have a roster of internal green projects which it is
working on. Promoting a product as green without underlying green
programs in all departments just makes a company that much blgger a
target... Companies need to go to the workbench, experlmenting all the
while with somewhat understated programs geared towards the pub-
lic... The bottom line is for companies to stop being so active on the
front lines and to pay more attention to how their decisions are made.”

WHY You SHOULDN'T PEE IN cum: SPACE 6 C

”Within a few years, astronauts are likely to face what scientists call ’a
significant risk’ of being hit by a droplet of urine traveling at more than
30,000 mph. At such a speed, they estimate, the impact of a cubic cen-
timeter of urine would be equivalent to a car traveling at 110 mph.

Scientists predict that the hazard from the amount of debris
from spacecraft accumulating in space, ranging from urine droplets to
rocket stages, is becoming so great that low orbits will become no-go
areas for satellites as well as astronauts.

They also fear there is a significant risk of objects colliding and
fragmenting into hundreds or thousands of particles traveling at high
speeds.

Recent calculations suggest that a critical density of junk will
soon be reached. More debris will be created than is removed by
destruction as it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere. This will lead to a
’cascade effect’ similar to a nuclear chain reaction.

Robert Bracher, head of Photon Dynamics, a company based
in Culham, England, said that the smallest particles caused by debris
could kill. ’A millimeter-sized particle can enter the body of an astro-
naut as a hole the size of a hypodermic needle and leave as a hole the
size of a football...”’

m QUOTES & FACTS

ENVIRONMENTALISM BY DESIGN

”We Americans are in the habit of attacking environmental effects
rather than causes. Our regulations, incentives and expectations are
focused on the output / supply / discharge side of our activities instead
of the input / demand/ design side. In a nutshell, we’re preoccupied
with maximizing output rather than customizing inputs. If we’re gen-
uinely committed to living in a less complex, healthier world, we need
to demand and develop technologies and lifestyles that precisely fit our
natural world rather than fight it.

We have to design imaginative new systems and technologies
that go with the flow, using what I call ’biologic.’ We can have the same ‘
services delivered far more efficiently —— eliminating much of the coun- W
try’s environmental impacts —— if we start designing for reality rather ‘
than oil-fueled fantasy.

...The global environment crisis we now face can be summa-
rized in a single phrase: There are too many humans doing too many
things stupidly. Our country’s generic population reminds me of a
crowded airport full of anxious tourists carrying heavy suitcases.
Getting rid of excess garbage such as poorly designed cars and gadgets
won’t be a deprivation or sacrifice, it will be a huge relief!

For example, since we buy much of our food and other con-
sumer goods from so far away, packaging has been necessary for pro—
tection from spoilage and damage. The packaging for a microwavable
’microwave’ dinner is programmed for a shelf life of maybe six
months, a cook-time of two minutes and a landfill dead-time of cen-
turies. Re-designing such imprecise packaging essentially means buy-
ing more of our goods from local sources and using them while they
are at their peak (which will also reduce transportation-related energy
use and the pollution it causes). In other words, we can’t really change
the way some products are designed without changing the way our
lives are designed.

...Environmental regulations are an intermediary between our
living earth and human activities. The kind of regulations we need
now will help drive those activities in the direction of better design.
Culture evolves just as an ecosystem or species does, and ours is evolv-
ing very quickly. Rather than just accommodating and limiting the
magnitude of pollution, inspired new regulations, ordinances and stan-
dards are now demanding better ways of doing things, and we need to
spread the word. We can have the same services and the same number
of jobs, but they’d better be more ingenious in approach or else they’re
against the law. _

...Housing and the ’built environment’ in general 15 another
sector that is tangled up in bad design. Fossil fuel-dependent assump-
tions haunt most of America’s buildings, limiting the positive effects of
individual actions. ’We shape our buildings,’ said Winston Churchill,
’then our buildings shape us.’ The unfortunate truth is that poorly
designed buildings being built right now will continue to mlsshape us
throughout the next century... our choices are limited by ﬂawed-build-
ing codes, simplistic architectural approaches and an overall buildlng
M scheme that assumes transportation will always be cheap...”

David Wonn, who works on pollution prevention with the EPA, writing in the November I990 issue of Buzzworm.

REFOCUSING DADDY WARBUCKS 6,;

”N ow that the nation’s dependency on foreign oil has snapped back
into focus, citizens have a right to ask: Why hasn’t the government
exercised its huge buying clout to create a market for energy-eff1c1ent
products, from cars to light bulbs to solar cells, and gotten us on track
toward self—sufficiency?

It is a question with larger implications. Big Consumer —— the
buying power of federal, state, and local governments —— amounts to
nearly one trillion dollars a year for goods and services. That is real
power to promote not just energy efficiency, but all kinds of safer,
cheaper products, and a better way of life.”

Ralph Nader, writing in the Nov/ Dec l990 issue of Motherlones.

 

 

GREEN ARROGANCE

”The environmental lobby has become very powerful. There are those
who might say it has become too powerful. In Washington, the strength
and weight of its inﬂuence has caused it to be dubbed ’the 500 pound
gorilla’. The number of ’green’ groups increases monthly, and the long
established groups -— like Greenpeace, the World Wide Fund for
Nature, and Friends of the Earth — have increased in both membership
size and sphere of inﬂuence at an astonishing rate. Increasingly the
demands of the green lobby are being enforced by legislation.

We are in danger of creating a ’them and us’ situation, with big
business ranged against ’environmentalists’. It is a little arrogant of
environmental groups to assume that only they care about the future.
Industrialists have children and grandchildren, too... Instead of con-
stantly shooting down industry, we should all be trying to co-operate
with it, to redirect from within. Not only will each side then have a bet-
ter understanding of the other’s viewpoints and constraints, but we
will be recognising a truth which seems to be getting submerged: It is

not necessary to be a member of a green pressure group to be an active
carer for the environment.”

AC'I' GLOBALLY, SINK LOCALLY

”I. Properly speaking, global thinking is not possible. Those who have
’thought globally’ (and among them the most successful have been
imperial governments and multinational corporations) have done so by
means of simplifications too extreme and oppressive to merit the name
of thought. Global thinkers tend to be dangerous also; we now have
national thinkers in the northeastern United States who look upon
Kentucky as a garbage dump.

II. Global thinking can only be statistical. Its shallowness is exposed by
the least intention to do something. Unless one is willing to be destruc-
tive on a very large scale, one cannot do something except locally, in a
small place. Global thinking can only do to the globe what a space
satellite does to it: reduce it, make a bauble of it. Look at one of those
photographs of half the earth taken from outer space, and see if you
recognize your neighborhood. If you want to see where you are, you
will have to get out of your space vehicle, out of your car, off your
horse, and walk over the ground. On foot you will find that the earth is
still satisfyingly large, and full of beguiling nooks and crannies.”

SOCIAL MOBILITY AS AN ECOLOGICAL PROBLEM

proposal: ’Don’t move!’ In those two words, Snyder captures the
essence of the North American dilemma — our rootlessness. We con-
stantly pick up and move without building a stake in the long-term
future of a place. '

Snyder believes when ’People say ”I’m going to stay here and
you can count on me being here 20 years from now,” what that does is
make a politically empowered community possible.’ And with that
commitment to ecological place, one’s perspective lengthens.”

mately 8,000 parts per billion (ppb)* of the natural carcinogen,
formaldehyde, while working on a contamination report for a former
factory in New Jersey. According to New Jersey law, If benzene, a man-
made carcinogen, is found in the groundwater at this site to exceed 1
ppb, the groundwater must be cleaned up.

In other words, we are allowed to drink 8,000 ppb of one car-

water may not even be a source of drinking water. If my most recent meal
was governed by the same regulations imposed on business and industrial

”...[E]Verybody wants wood. But nobody seems to want to face the fact
that you have to cut down trees to get it. Cutting down trees is a messy
business.

A cut-over area looks ugly. Even after it’s reforested it looks
barren for seven years or so. So we can understand Why the public is
asking us to be more sensitive to landscape logging and to make sure
that we maximize our reforestation efforts. And we’re doing that.

But there are people who are using the emotional triggers of a
messy clearcut to demand massive preservation and bans on clearcut
logging. There are those who say [in effect] that we shouldn’t have any
logging at all in the old-growth forests on the B.C. coast.

...Stopping old-growth logging would shut down our coastal
industry, and the Interior, too. Ending clearcuts would have virtually
the same effect.

That would decimate the B.C. economy, and the same is true
for Canada as a trading nation. The forest industry is this country’s
largest net exporter. Take away the dollars, yen, and pounds it earns
and there’s only so long we could subsist by selling each other our
used real estate.

History is full of examples where opportunists took advantage

A CUDDLY ACRONYM THAT BI'I'ES

”But green consumers, this survey argues, may not be the most durable
or pervasive force for corporate change. The green voter will be more
inﬂuential in the long run. Encouraged by approving electors, govern-
ments will impose on industry ever stronger environmental regula-
tions, and ever higher penalties for polluting. Driving the regulators
will be the growing force of N IMBY — Not In My Back Yard. Popular
hostility to the siting of any large enterprise, and especially one
thought remotely likely to pollute, will also increasingly inﬂuence
industry’s behaviour.

N IMBYism will require companies that hope to expand to be
squeaky clean; it will encourage ways to avoid the need for trouble-
some new power stations and plants; above all, it will raise the expense
and difficulty of getting rid of rubbish, industrial and —— increasingly
— municipal. First, society will demand cleaner industrial processes;
then it will want cleaner products. Because voters will refuse to give
themselves room to get rid of their waste, industry will be asked to
provide them with less polluting ways to satisfy their needs.

These pressures, this survey suggests, will change the way
companies manage themselves, and their relations with their suppliers
and their customers. Above all, though, relations between government
and industry will be altered. The green revolution will be underpinned
by government intervention — to set emission standards, to tax raw
materials, to assign liability for polluting accidents. That will encour-
age industry and government to see a common interest in a cleaner
environment. The best companies will want intervention to protect
their market from dirty, cheap-skate foreign competitors and from their
less virtuous rivals at home. Government will see the need to frame
intervention to get the cleanest technology at the least cost to industry.
Countries which lag behind will find themselves eventually having to
choose between protecting home markets and settling for a lower qual-
ity of environment, or importing technologies developed by greener
competitors.”

”This is not a disaster, it is merely a Change. The area won’t have disapi
peared, it will just be under water. Where you now have cows, you Will
have fish.”

J.R. Spradley, leader of the US. delegation to an international meeting on climate change in Geneva last
September, speaking to delegates from Bangladesh, reprinted in The Environmental Forum, Nov/ Dec, 1990.

DIRTY worms

”What does ’clean up’ mean? When the technicians scour the oil-coated
shore or go behind warning fences at toxic sites, put on moonsuits and
rev up their vacuum-cleaner trucks, What, exactly, is going on? What is
left when they’re done? Where do they empty the vacuum-cleaner
bags?

I’ve been asking those questions for a long time. About the
only firm conclusion I’ve come to is that ’clean up’ is rarely the right
expression for what we do with toxic wastes. ’Fence off’ might be more
accurate, or ’immobilize for awhile,’ or ’put somewhere else,’ or ’hide.’

For example, the number-one site on the Superfund list, the
Lipari landfill in New Jersey, is an eight-acre dump containing three
million gallons of mixed chemicals. Fumes from the dump brought
tears to the eyes of neighbors; a lake downstream occasionally turned
purple or orange. The cleanup plan called for ’containment.’ The site
was initially surrounded by an underground concrete wall and covered
with a cap of clay and plastic. Chemicals continue to leach out in the
groundwater, and fumes still come through the cap. Now the site will
be ’re—cleaned.’ The lake will be dredged and the bottom mud put
somewhere else, and the landfill will be ﬂushed with water for seven
years. This water will then be collected, treated, and put somewhere
else.

In another of the Superfund operations, PCB-contaminated
electrical equipment abandoned in a warehouse in North Carolina was
hauled to a special toxics facility in Alabama. The material was shred-
ded, packaged, and sent to an incinerator in Chicago. In the ﬂames the
PCBs became water vapor, carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas), and var-
ious chlorine compounds (causes of smog and stratospheric ozone
depletion). The ash went back to Alabama to be landfilled. Much clean-
er, but not clean. And very expensive.

Even those cleanup efforts that are chemically possible are
foiled if the toxic’materials become dispersed in soil, carried off in
water, absorbed into living things, wafted away in the air, or mixed up
together. Scooping spilled oil out of the water and off the rocks of
Prince William Sound is impossible.”

Donella Meadows, writing in The Neighborhood Works, reprinted in Utne ReaderJuly/ August 1990.

 

 

”The quickest way to get many pesticides out of tropical rivers may be
to cause the acceptance of blemished bananas [in] New York...”

Don Jonzen, a tropical ecologist, writing in WorIdWatch, July/August 1990.

 

 

 

TAKING THE STING OUT

gested that corporate officers might learn a lot from theology. The editor feels ”the
essence of capitalism is service to society, not being a predator on society...The
new capitalist understands we can’t go on chewing up the earth because it makes
neither ethical nor financial sense.” Practical. Realistic. Well-written and designed.
