Dear Mrs. McAleenan:

Thank you for your letter of February 8 in which you express
your support of bills relating to the humane treatment of
animals.

The first two bills you mention were assigned to the House
Agriculture Committee but nothing is scheduled in the way

of hearings at the present time. The third bill was assigned
to the House Science and Technology Committee and there again,
I am advised by staff, the bill is pending with no action
scheduled.

The export of skins of bobcat, lynx, and river otter is
controlled by an agency known as the Endangered Species
Scientific Authority. I have received some correspondence
objecting to the restrictions promulgated by that agency.

A wildlife expert at Colorado State University, for example,
contends that bobcat in Colorado are not in any danger of
extinction.

In any event, I appreciate having your statement, and your
letter will be part of any file I have at hand when legislation

is brought to the Floor of the House.

Sincerely yours,

J es P. lohnson?

Thank you for writing to again express your support for amendments to the
Animal Welfare Act.

I'm sure you'll be pleased to learn this legislation was approved by the
full House a couple of weeks ago. Mrs. Heckler's amendment concerning
humane standards compliance by government research organizations was also
adopted as part of H.R. 5808. For your information, I was among those
voting for passage of this bill.

Legislation regarding the use of leg—hold steel traps, which you mention,

Dear Keren:

 
 
 

Knowing of your interest in the humane treatment of animals, I
wanted to let you know about two actions that took place late
last year relating to the brutal clubbing of harp seals off the
coast of Newfoundland in the spring.

 
      
  
   
   
 
  
   
   
   
    
 
 
 

Early last year, I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 236 to
designate March 1, 1983 the National Day of the Seal. I am
pleased to say that in the last days of last year's session, my
resolution was passed by the House. A similar measure had passed
earlier in the Senate. I believe this is an important step in
our efforts to focus attention on the brutal clubbing of these
defenseless animals each spring.

For years, I have felt that the best way to end this clubbing is
to support bans on the import of seal skins, the product for
which the baby seals are killed. The U.S. has enacted such a ban
and early last year I began to round up signatures for a telex to
the Enropean Community in support of a resolution pending there
to ban seal imports. I was heartened by the fact that 218 of my
colleagues (a majority of the House of Representatives) signed my
telex, and in December the European Community voted to recommend
a temporary ban on seal imports until March of this year. At
that time, a permanent ban will be considered.

European leaders of this movement have thanked me repeatedly for
urging this course of action. While these thanks are gratifying,
I believe it is more important to commend the Americans such as
you who have worked to make the humane treatment of animals in
this country and around the world a visible issue. Certainly, a
great deal more needs to be done and I remain committed to
continuing progress in this area.

  
       
    
   

cerely,

\

Dear Congressman Jacdbs:

I was delighted to see that you have intrcduced H. Con.
Res. 58.

Year introductien of thiszesolution last year was
Certainly helpful in getting some actien by the Food
and Drug Administration in this field. However,
further pressure regarding the Draize test and other
painful tests is much needed.

Did you see the recommendation by a committee of the
National Research'Council concerning nonwanimal tests?

I enclose a copy of.their news release.

H. CON. RES. 58

Expressing the sense of the Congress that any Federal agency that utilizes the
Draize rabbit eye irritancy test should develop and validate alternative
ophthalmic testing procedures that do not require the use of animal test
subjects.

 

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

FEBRUARY 15, 1983

Mr. JACOBS submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to
the Committee on Energy and Commerce

 

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of the Congress that any Federal agency
that utilizes the Draize rabbit eye irritancy test should
develop and validate alternative ophthalmic testing proce-

dures that do not require the use of animal test subjects.

Whereas the Draize rabbit eye irritancy test has long been used
by various Federal agencies for predicting human ophthal-
mic response to pesticides and toxic chemicals, household
cleaning solvents, some medicinal products, and other haz-
ardous substances;

Whereas the Draize test causes significant pain to the albino

rabbit which is used in each irritancy test;

Whereas the reliability of the Draize test has been called into
question: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved- by the House of, Representatives (the Senate

concurring), That, it is the sense of {the Congress that the I'

Department of Health and Human Services, the Consumer

Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection

Agency, and any other department, agency, or instrumental-
ity of‘ the United States that utilizes, the Draize rabbit eye
irritancy test, should develop and validated alternative Oph-
thalmic testing procedures that do not require theliise of

animal test subjects.

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your recent communication expressing
support for the Endangered Species Act and opposing any
weakening amendments.

You will be pleased to know that the full Merchant .
Marine and Fisheries Committee unanimously reported legis-
lation for this purpose on May 5, 1982. This bill extends
the current level of funding for three additional years.
It also speeds up the listing process by forcing the
Secretary to consider listing or delisting of a species
whenever a petition is received that contains substantial
evidence of the need for such action. H. R. 6133 neither
weakens nor strengthens the Act, but simply makes it work
better. It has the support of the environmental community
as well as most of the representatives of industries
concerned with the Act.

I appreciate being informed of your interest in this
most important legislation.

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your recent communication supporting the
reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act and expresSIng
your particular concern about the protection of bobcats under
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES).

H. R. 6133, legislation to reauthorize the Endangered
Species Act for three years, was ordered favorably reported
by a unanimous vote of the full Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee on May 5. As amended by the Committee, this §111 .
neither weakens nor strengthens the Act, but merely refines it
to make it a more efficient and effective tool for the conser~
vation of our endangered species. The amendments were worked
out with and have the approval of all of the major groups
concerned. Language was included in the bill to require that
the Secretary of the Interior make determinations With respect
to exPort of species listed on Appendix II of CITES on the
basis of the best available biological information derived
from professionally accepted wildlife management practices.
This amendment does not weaken the protection afforded bobcats'
and other species under CITES nor does it lessen the Secretary s
responsibilities thereunder.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important matter.

Sincerely,

{U gain {3 Amen——

Dear Christine:

As I promised in a previous letter, attached is a copy of
a letter I received from the Department of State.

I doubt that I will receive any letters from the European
countries, but at least Secretary Haig got it and was nice
enough to have some one answer it.

If I receive any more letter I'll send you copies.

Dear Ms. Jablonski=

I am replying to your correspondence to Secretary Haig
asking that the United States take action against nations which
objected to decisions adopted at the July 1981 meeting of the
International Whaling Commission.(IWClT

. Under the International Convention for the Regulation of
Whaling, IWC-members-have ninety days after official notification
to object to amendments in the Schedule of the Convention (which
includes quotas and substantive regulations). Filing an objec-
tion triggers a second period during which other members may also
object. Nations filing an.objection.are not bound by the amend-
ment until the objection is withdrawn.

The IWC decided to prohibit the "take" of Northwest Pacific
sperm whales from the end of the 1981 whaling season until new
management measures are adOpted. Japan objected to this ruling,
characterizing its decisionias an effort to preserve its options
if new measures are not adopted at the special meeting. The
question of the 1982 catch limits will be reconsidered at the IWC
annual meeting this July.

The IWC also decided to prohibit the use of cold grenade
(non-exploding) harpoons to take minke whales for commercial pur-
poses. Japan, Iceland, Norway, the USSR, and Brazil all objected
to this decision. They stated their objections are precaution—
ary: that harpoons designed to comply with the new prohibition
are being developed and tested. but may not be ready for use by
the time the whaling season begins this fall.

Under the Pelly Amendment to the Fisherman's Protective Act

of 1967, the.Secretary of Commerce must certify to the President
when foreign nationals are fishing or whaling in a way that dimin-
ishes the effectiveness of international fishery conservation
programs. The President may then embargo the importation of fish
products from the country in question. In addition, the
Packwood—Magnuson Amendment to the Magnuson Fishery Conservation
and Management Act of 1976 gives the Secretary of Commerce simi-
lar monitoring and certification responsibilities. However, cer-
tification under this amendment requires the automatic withdrawal
of at least 50 percent of the offending country's fishery
allocation within the U.S. 200 mile zone.

 




We are reviewing the question of whether certification is
apprOpriate at this time. We are also encouraging the objecting
countries to explore solutions that would allow the objections to
be withdrawn.

The United States has taken the lead within the IWC to
achieve effective protection for all whale populations. We
intend_to maintain that leadership.

Sincerely.

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your recent letter regarding reauthorization
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

H.R. 2948, which reauthorizes this Act for one year, was
favorably reported by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee
on May 13. Additional legislation, H.R. 4084, has since been
introduced and was the subject of hearings on July 13. This
latter bill was the result of extensive negotiation between
representatives of the Committee and of environmental and other

interest groups.' It contains a number of amendments, which are
designed to resolve certain existing problems that have prevented

Dear Friend:

Thank you for writing me to express your support for
reauthorization of the Harine lemmal Protection Act.

The Merchant harine and Fisheries Committee approved
legislation for this purpose, E. P. 2948, on Pay 13. As
approved by the Committee, H.P. 2948 e:» :tends this authori~
zation for a one~year period only.

Like you, I would have preferred a more extended autho~
rization. The fact is, however, that thus Act has some serious
problems which must be resolved before it can accomplish the
purposes for which it was enacted. These issues include, for
instance, the return of management to the several interested
states and the Alaskan Eative exemption. Failure to resolve
these issues has resulted in a situation in which neither the
Federal Government nor the states are managing marine mammals,
particularly in Alaska where the killing of such species as

a, walrus and polar bears is now basically unregulated to the
"‘great detriment of these species.

A one~year reauthorization will continue pressure on the
various interest groups to reach agreement on a resolution of
these issues. In the meantime, the Subcomwittee will hold
hoversight hearings and, if workable solutions to these problems
gcan be accomplished in the next few months, the bill can be
famended on the Floor of the house to further extend the

\ authorizatlon ' ”“

I appreciate being informed of your thinking on this
important legislation and you may be assured of my efforts to
resolve these issues in the best interests of the species con—
cerned.

Sincerely,

/ W ,.,.-

Dear K6 ran :

Thanks for sending the letter from Congressman Joffordo and all
the news about the'biology teadher and distribution of ”Let U3
Live" pamphlets. ‘

I am particularly interested in the grocery store owner whose dog
was caught in'a trap. We have collected a substantial number of
letters and some ohotographo from owners of dogs and cats that
havo been trapped and injured. If we can ever manage to got
hearings. we plan to submit them to the Committee, for we feel
that many people art more sympathetic towardo the sufferings of
animals of a kind they are acquainted with than of the wildlife
whioh they so rarely see. If the grocery store owner would’be
willing to write a lotto: telling‘how and when the dog‘waa caught
and what injuries ho may have sustained, we would very much like
to add it to the others.

we have had an extremely hard fight over the Marine Mammal Pro»

tootion Act roauthorization, and it‘s not finished yet. It has

boon expensive to tend out mailings and do the Christian Science
Manitor ad. However, I am euro you will be pleased to hear that
fourteen other papers ran it without dharge as a public service.
so the word 15 certainly being spread around.

Kindest regards,

leading role in the arduous work involved in passing the Elephant
Protection Act, the Marine mammal Protection Act. and the ower~
sight and resolution of many problcma relating to tuna purse
aalning in whidh dolphins are incidentally killed or injured.

. Mr. Howell is experienced in‘mattera relating to the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Speclna of Wild Fauna and
Flora, a treaty whose importance is constantly growing. Ha made
an extensive inspection and assessment of the ivory trade world-
wida and wrote an important report on his findings.

Jeff C. Young

J.Y. How long have you been a
vegetarian?

A.J- A little over seven years, since
February of 1970.

J.Y. What made you decide to
become a vegetarian?

AJ. A couple of things. I was
among those who opposed our par-

ticipation in the Vietnam Vv’ar. That .

was in 1965—66.

J.Y. That was your first term in
Congress? .

A.J. That’s right. There weren’t too
*nany of us opposing it. I should say
hat there weren't many of us who had
ead history and presumed to mahe
.istory byvoting in Congress, and
herefore those of us who did oppose
he war were somewhat in demand by
roups that felt the some way. I
“taught of the metaphor referring to
K? ease that merr-vbers of Congress
“id the Executive branch condemned
merican kids to dangerous
tuations and death that many eat

eat, but few go down to the
czughterhouse. And then in June of

59 I acquired a Great Dane puppy.

J.Y. C-S?

A.J. Yes, C~5, who grew lihe a
government contract. By the time he
got to be about the size of a calf I
began to thinh about-veal, an innocent
sounding term. Veal is a calf, a tiny
cow. The usual process is to tahe the
calf rather early from its mother.
They say that if you listen you can
almost hear human screams between
the calf and its mother when they are
ported, and of course the calf is put to
death. I studied what goes on at
slaughterhouses, and discovered that
the common method of putting these
animals to death is to slit their
throats. Forceps are normally used.
They are gathered by their hind legs
on a wench and hoisted and forceps
are put in the nostrils so that the head
is jerhed back. By the time the hind
legs are reared up a lot of the blood

vessels have already been ruptured

and broken. Death is death, but, ap-
parently the most harrowing ex—
perience is for the animal im-
mediately behind to see all this and
anticipate that this is going to happen.
Chevy Chaseon his special did a piece

M~——N~Hmw—.~u———M

on that. He showed himself out
mingling with the cows in the pasture,
talking to them and petting them.
Then he loaded himself on the trucks
with them, and at the end of the piece
what we euphemistically call steahs
were coming out on the asSembly line,
there he was with his microphone
going right along with them. I think
Edward R. Murrow said that the pain
from the cut of a little finger would
render more sensation to some people
than the knowledge that their fellow-
man is cut to ribbons elsewhere in the
world. I realize that the pattern of
creation is that lions go out and hill
lambs. I guess the question that I
asked myself in the terms of
civilization was whether we are
human beings were higher animals

’ and more civilized and can part with

that basically violent thing, and if we
can, then it seems to me that we
might be better at being hind to each
other.

J.Y.When you changed your diet
was it a gradual transition? Did you
quite eating meat cold turkey?

A.J. Yes, from February of 1970 to
the autumn, I decided that I would
only eat deep sea fish, no warm
blooded animals at all. If in the fall I
found that it was too onerous to give
up meat, I would resume eating meat,
or ifIfound that I could do it, I would
take the next step and excise the deep
sea fish. What happened was that
during the first 30 days I had an ex-
perience that could be compared to
withdrawal from drugs, from the
description I heard. It was very
difficult. It was very difficult to smell

'a Colonel Sanders.

J.Y. Then you still craved meat
after you quit?

A.J. Yes‘, for 30 days it was just
terrible. Then I had the feeling that
one describes as going through a
storm or the outer atmosphere of

 




renity. Never again did it become a , ‘25.»; ..-‘ ' i ~ if; most of the people who attend those

Dear Bongressman Jeffords.

Thank you for your letter of June 4th enclosing a letter from a.
constituent. we have been attempting over the years to improve conditions
for laboratory anhmals and to prevent cruel eXperiments. Just recently
we have published a ZOO-page report entitled Physical and Mental

Sufferin of E erimental Animals. It is a review of the scientific
literature from 1975 to 1978. I hope you may find the time to read
at least some partsoof this report, because it shows clearly that

there is a urgent need for action to prevent needless suffering and
useless experimentation.’

 

‘Ms. Ring is correct in stating that answers are not available
to the questions that she lists on page 2 of her letter. Approximate
numbers of animals that are covered under the Animal welfare Act are
available from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the
0.5. Department of Agriculture; however, there are large numbers of
animals not included there. Birds are not under the Act as yet nor
are rats and mice, of which approximately 50 million are used each
year. Ms. Ring is correct in stating that dummies can be used for
some kinds of experiments and tests. In some medical schools they
are now used exclusively in certain courses which use to utilize dogs.

In addition to dummies there is the Opportunity to use other
types of alternatives. A very important advance in the testing of
toxic substances is the Ames test which uses bacteria. If the test
substance causes the bacteria to mutate this torresPOnds between
.901 and 100% with animal test showing carcinogenicity of the substance.
The Amos test is completed in a matter of days and cost; Very much
less than the animal test which takes two to three years and cost

hundreds of thousands of dollars for each test. Because the animals
tests are so eXpensive and slow; many substances have not been tested,
and they continue to be used, thus there is compéeling reason to
exPend government funds to develop more tests of this nature. To

some extent such tests are being developed by industry or individuals,
but the process would be very much accelerated if funds were available
for grants for this specific purpose.

Beckman Instruments recently developed a bacterial test for
polluted water which gives the answer in a matter of 1/2 hour whereas
the currently used fish test takes four days and is very much more
crude. The bacteria used in this test have a mechanism which gives
out light, This makes much more sensitive measurements possibLe——
six thmes more sensitive than the fish test, in fact.

'You may be aware of the bill introduced by Congressmen Drinan
on the subject. Poseibly you would wish to refer this pending
legislation in responding to M8. Ring. The number cf the Drinan
bill is H. R. 282. , ‘

we appreciate your interest in this very serious subject and

if you would like additional information from.our files we will be
happy to supply it.

Sincerely,~

Christine Stevens

Representative James Jeffords
U. S. House of Representatives
Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Jeffords:

I am sending to you herewith the Spring Bulletin of The National Anti-
Vivisection Society which contains information of the most appalling exper-
‘iments on monkeys by the United States government. Although it is sicken~
ing reading, I hope you will take the time to read it.

It_is ghastly to realize that experimental laboratories all over our
-country are conducting "research" on helpless animals in the name of sci—
ence - many of which are repetitive for long periods of time, many of
which are known to be useless when applied to humans (or even when applied
to animals), and almost all of which are carried out without a sharing of

’”‘findings with other laboratories. Each laboratory makes its OWN experi-

i;ments, at the expense of torturing living animals which were created by a
-.1°Ving God- .

-i_'ny purpose in writing is because I want very much to learn Why my tax

~.hdollars are spent in this way. On page 3 of the Bulletin there is'a‘state~_
-_ment that, to determine what effect killer radiation doses from nuclear

' weapons will have on battlefield troops: "all of the animals used in the
studies a over 1,000 since 1973 - died." Our government has been spending
money and inflicting cruel pain on monkeys for six years: Is it reasona—
ble that they have not found their answer in all this time, if indeed an
answer is actually being sought?

.  _ I have read that the government grants millions of dollars every year

for scientific research, many of which sound utterly ridiculous, such as
studies on the mating instincts of penguins, the love life of parakeets,
why children react to parental discipline, etc. The Army made exhaustive
studies ~ purportedly in the reahnof anti-riot control — by shooting hard
pellets into groups of dogs, all of which were maimed or killed; and these
experiments continued for YEARS. I have heard also that the Army and Air
Force conduCted their own independent experiments on beagle puppies to de—
termine if cigarette smoke is harmful (2), as if we don't already know it.
These experiments also Continued over a long period, and probably are still
going on, since legal steps to stop them failed.

. I know that I must continue to pay my taxes, and it really troubles
me that while I refuse to contribute a penny to any organization that
'puts their money into this type of "research" I am helping to torture
animals through my tax money. It may be impossible for the government to
abolish private research of this nature, but it is an affront to use tax
money to help it along, particularly when there is a MECHANICAL DUMMY
-which could be used instead of helpless animals.

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your recent letter regarding reauthorization
of the Carine Mammal Protection Act.

{.R. 2948, which reauthorizes this Act for one year, was_
favorably reported by the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee
on Kay 13. Additional legislation, E.R. 4084, has Since been
introduced and was the subject of hearings on July 13- This
latter bill was the result of extensive negotiation between
representatives of the Committee and of environmental and .
other interest groups. It contains a number of amendments, which
are designed to resolve certain existing problems that have
nrevented full implementation of the Act, and extends the
reauthorization until September 30, 1984. H.R. 4084 is scheduled
to be marked up by the Subcommittee on July 21 and by the Full
Committee on July 29. The plan then is to combine the two
bills and bring them before the House as a package immediately
after Congress returns from the August recess.

I appreciate being informed of your interest in this important
legislation and I am pleased to be able to provide you With this
favorable report.

A photostat of a clipping from MAINSTREAM (Fall, 1978) is enclosed. It
is true that to make a great many of these dummies would be expensive,

but well worth it. Many laboratories could be closed down, findings
shared with all who requested such data, and helpless animals spared un—
told anguish and terror. On top of this, the scientists who apparently
'take either pleasure or no thought of the pain of others would be retired.

. Will you please find out for me how much money was spent by our gov~
ernment last year in grants for research, broken down:

Each type of experiment, with amount involved

The findings-sought by each experiment

The time involved (days, months, or years)

The number of repeats of the experiments

The number of animals tortured, maimed and killed
because of the experiments

If this information is not available (and I frankly doubt that it is), I
would like very much to know why our government is underwriting at great
cost research for which little or no accounting is made.

I believe God gave us stewardship of animals and other phases of na~
ture for a loftier purpose than wanton cruelty and destruction.

Thank you for your efforts to unearth the facts in this deplorable
situation.

Sincerely yours,

SUBJ: AMENDMENT TO THE ENDANGERED SPECIES BILL
' ENSURING CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT

 

Dear Colleague:

The Endangered Species Bill establishes a new set of
procedures whereby the conflict between major projects
and the future of endangered species is finalized.

There is only one thing missing: the role of Congress.

If we are going to establish a way to eliminate Species
from our world, we in the Congress ought to have the
courage to have the final "yea" or "nay."

Therefore, I am offering a simple amendment which
parallels the procedures we have established in the
Executive Reorganization Act in order to offer Members

an opportunity to approve or disapprove the recommendations
of the Executive branch Endangered Species Committee

which results in the elimination of a species. This
provides for a resolution of disapproval to go to the
floor of each chamber and if either chamber disapproves

the recommendation by a majority the decision to eliminate
a species is defeated.

It is only right that Congress, which has initiated this
legislation, also retain the power to speak to the final
issue involved in it. It should be emphasized that under
this amendment, Congress only becomes involved when a
decision has been made which will reSult in the elimination
of a species.

I ask you to think carefully about your decision on this
amendment, and on our responsibilities in this important
legislation.. I hope you will be able to support me in
this effort.

Est Day’s Action:

 

Congress Clears Legislation
Allowing Some Exemptions
To Endangered SpeCies Act

Congress Oct. 15 cleared legislation allowing exemp-
tions under the Endangered Species Act so that future con—
flicts with public works projects — such as the one that pit-
ted a tiny fish against a Tennessee dam — could be avoided.

Both houses approved the conference report on the bill
(H Rept 95-1804) by voice vote. As sent to the president, the
bill (S 2899) set up a Cabinet-level board to consider per-
mitting construction of federal projects, even though they
might kill off species protected by the 1973 law (PL 93-205).
(Endangered Species Act background, 1973 Almanac p.
670)

The drive in Congress to make the law more flexible
was sparked by a June 15 Supreme Court decision barring
operation of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s (TVA) Tellico
Dam, which already had been built. The court, in a 6-3 deci-
sion, ruled that opening the ﬂoodgates of the $119 million
dam would destroy the critical habitat of a three-inch fish
called the snail darter. (Court decision, Weekly Report p.
1616)

Rearguard Tactics

The sentiment to soften the law was so strong in
Congress that members allied with environmentalists early
on gave up fighting the concept of exemptions. Instead,
members such as Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., con-
centrated their efforts on keeping modifications of the law to
a minimum.

At one point, Rep. Robin L. Beard Jr., R-Tenn., a critic
of the law, threatened to introduce 682 amendments to the
bill, lifting protection for many species, if his views did not
prevail. In the past, Beard had sought fruitlessly to get an
exemption to the law for TVA’s Columbia Dam in his dis-
trict. '

Environmentalists scored one of their few victories
when the conference committee rejected a House provision
granting automatic exemptions for both Tellico and the
Gray Rocks Dam in Wyoming. A U.S. District Court had
ruled that the Wyoming project could not be completed
because it threatened an area alOng the migratory patterns
of the whooping and sandhill cranes.

Meeting on the final day of the session, the conferees
settled on mandating an early review of the Tellico and
Gray Rocks projects by the Cabinet-level board.

Generally, however, the law’s critics had their way. For
instance, the conferees retained a House provision limiting
funding authorization for administration of the act to 18
months. The Senate version authorized funding for three
years.

Critics wanted the shorter authorization period so they
could hold oversight hearings sooner on how the changed
law was being implemented. Also, many members were in-
fluenced by word that a General Accounting Ofﬁce study,
due out February 1979, would criticize the administration of
the existing law.

Conference and ﬁnal action on S 2899 came quickly
because the authorization for the Office of Endangered
Species had expired Sept. 30. A wide variety of federally
funded projects — such as airport expansion, highway con-
struction and dam building — were forced to halt because
they could not complete a legally required consultation with
the office.

The review board created by S 2899 consisted of seven
persons. Its rulings were to be based on recommendations
made by a lower-level, three-member panel.

The bill first was passed by the Senate July 19 by a
huge 94-3 margin. The original Senate bill provided only for
a Cabinet-level board. (Senate action, Weekly Report p.
1875)

House Action

By a unanimous vote, the House Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee reported its own version of the bill (HR
14104 —— H Rept 95-1625) Sept. 19. The proposal, based on a
lot of negotiating among committee members, provided for
a six-member review panel, whose composition was slightly
different from that in the Senate bill. (Committee action,
Weekly Report p. 2535; background, p. 2506)

Bargaining was intense over the make-up of the board,
with both sides pushing for inclusion of officials they felt
wOuld be more sympathetic to their views.

But tempers flared when the bill reached the House
floor, especially after amendments were approved giving
exemptions to the two dams.

At one point, Andy Jacobs Jr., D-Ind., shook his fist at
Dingell, whom he accused of using “abusive language,” and
declared, “Somebody around here is about to become an en
dangered species if he comes up to me that way again
without a pistol.”

The House Oct. 14 passed HR 14104 on a 384-12 roll-
call vote and substituted its text for that of S 2899 so the
conference committee would be working with one bill.

The House approved amendments:

OReducing extensions of funding authorization for the
Ofﬁce of Endangered Species, in the Department of the
Interior, from three years to 18 months. Beard insisted on
the change, threatening to tie up the House indefinitely if he
did not get it. Funding for the office was $23 million in fiscal

1979 and $12.5 million for the period from Oct. NT, , to
March 31, 1980. The Department of Commerce, which also
administers the act, was given $2.5 million for fiscal 1979
and $12.5 million for the following six months.

OStipulating that the Gray Rocks Dam and Reservoir,
known as the Missouri Basin Power Project, satisfied the re-
quirements of the act and did not. need to go before the
review board. The standing vote was 29—14.

0 Exempting the Tellico Dam’and Reservoir Project from
the provisions of the act. The amendment’s sponsor, John J.
Duncan, R-Tenn., whose district contained the dam, argued
that. the project no longer threatened the snail darter. A
large number of the fish had been transplanted to another
river, he said. The roll—call vote was 231-157. (Vote 813, p.
3092)

OStriking language from the House bill that directed
courts to give preference over other matters to appeals of en-
dangered species rulings by the review board.

ORequiring the secretary of the interior to consider the
economic impact of designating an area the critical habitat
of a species.

OExempting military activities related to preparedness
from the provisions of the act. This allowed maneuvers,
equipment testing and other training to go forward despite
the presence of an endangered species. Other military-
related activities, however, such as the building of an of-
ficers’ club, would continue to be subject to the law.

OPermitting appeals of board decisions to begin in the
circuit court of appeals, rather than in the US. district
court, where calendars are more clogged and the chances of
delay greater.

Conference Action

The major change made in conference was to alter the
composition of the Cabinet-level board, tilting it slightly
more toward the pro-development side. The chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality, included in both House
and Senate bills, was replaced by the chairman of the Coun-
cil of Economic Advisers (CEA).

Early review for the Tellico and Gray Rocks projects
was substituted for automatic exemption using the argu-
ment that special consideration for the two dams in the bill
would undermine the integrity of the act.

Other major House amendments were accepted by the
conference committee.

Both houses swiftly approved the conference bill by
voice votes.

PAGE 3046—Oct. 21, 1978

.~ Provisions
As approved by Congress, S 2899:

0 Set up a seven-member Endangered Species Commit-
tee to determine whether a project should be exempted. At
least five votes would be needed to grant an exemption. The
board would be composed of the secretaries of agriculture,
the army and the interior; the chairman of the CEA; the
administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency and
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;
and a presidential appointee from the affected state, as

. recommended by its governor.

0 Established a lower-level, three-member board to hear
cases and make recommendations to the Cabinet-level
group. This panel would be made up of one member ap-
pointed by the Interior secretary; one from the affected
state, as suggested by its governor and appointed by the
president; and an administrative law judge selected by the
Civil Service Commission.

0 Required that a project meet three tests to receive an
exemption. It would have to demonstrate that 1) there was
no “reasonable and prudent alternative,” 2) its benefits to
the public outweighed the continued existence of a species
and 3) it was of national or regional significance.

0 Mandated that the Cabinet-level board establish
methods to save a species if it is doomed by the approval of a
project. Breeding a species in captivity or transplanting it to
another locale are two such ways.

ORequired that the Interior secretary review the en-
dangered species list every five years to see if some species
might be dropped and some added.

ORequired public hearings by the Interior Department
for designation of endangered species’ critical habitats. The

 

The sentiment to soften the law
was so strong in Congress that
members allied with environmen-
talists early on gave up fighting the
concept of exemptions. Instead,
they concentrated their efforts on
keeping modifications of the law to
a minimum.

 

, hearing must occur in the same area where the proposed site

designation is located.

0 Restricted the authority to apply for an exemption to
governors, the federal agency concerned and the holder of a
federal permit or license to build and operate a project.

0 Allowed any person to appeal the review board’s deci-
sion in court. ~ I

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your comments exg3sI essing your concern regarding
the Federai budget.

As you know, the House Budget Committee proposed a budget
which did not cut spending for programs such as sociai and community
services as deepiy as the cuts proposed by the Administration.
However, on May 20, the House of Representatives adopted a budget
which endorsed the tax and spending cuts proposed by the President.

The Budget Resoiution

The Appropriations Committee and other committees

recommend the actuai funding Tevei for specific programs within

the totai Timits proposed by the Budget Committee. This year,
however, tne Budget Resoiution reguires those committees to reduce
Teveis of spending to achieve savings of some $3 o oiiiion in ﬁscai
Year 1982.

Your comments are appreciated. They are heTpfuT to us in
making decisions concerning the Federai budget.

With best wishes,

Dear Marian:

Many thanks for your recent correspondence expressing
support for the McCloskey amendments to H.R. 6970.

As you know, the current controversy centers around the
question of how high the quotas and how strict the reg-
ulations should be. The tuna industry maintains that the
present regulations are too restrictive and will result
in the bankruptcy of the fleet and its subsequent transfer
to foreign registry. In response to this, Congressman
Murphy has proposed this legislation which would increase
the 1977 porpoise quota from 59,050 to 78,900. It would
also authorize observers to be placed on vessels, provide
financial incentives to reduce the porpoise kill rate,
and fines for those who exceed the kill rate.

As you point out, Congressman McCloskey will be offering
several strengthening amendments on the floor of the House,
and I expect to support these measures. I feel we should
have‘azspecific annual reduction in theﬁquota levels,

and vigorously develop and promote techniques which do

not result in the loss of marine mammal life.

Again, thanks for cont.

Thank you for your recent letter concerning
H.R. 5808, the Animal Welfare Act. This ’
bill passed the House by—a fairly wide mar-
gin on February 9. I supported this legis—
lation as I felt it was important to eXpand
and improve federal regulatory functions on
handling and transporting of animals.

H.R. 66 is currently pending in the live—
stock subcommittee and probably will be
acted upon sometime later this year.

I appreciate your comments and look forward
to hearing from you again.

Dear Mrs. McAleenan:

Thank you for your letter of December 15 concerning the vivisection program
at the American MUseum of Natural History in New York.

As you may know, Representative Edward Koch of New York introduced a bill
in the 94th Congress to create a commission on the humane treatment of
animals. The bill would have established a panel to study treatment of
animals in laboratory research experiments, trapping, the domeStic pet in-
dustry and other possible areas of animal abuse. Unfortunately, the bill
never was reported out of the House Agriculture Committee.

However, Rep. Koch plans to re-introduce the bill in the first session of
the new 95th Congress. I hope he will have better luck this time.

I appreciate your letting me know your views on this issue and others, and
will keep them in mind if the bill comes to the House floor for a vote.
Please do not hesitate to contact me again if you feel strongly about any
issue in the future.

Dear Mrs. McAleenan:

Thank you for your inquiry of this month regarding my position on a num—
ber of matters relating to animal protection.

Several initiatives have been made in the Congress this year relating
to the protection of animals, among them the far—ranging Animal Welfare
Act Amendments, Public Law 94-279, that received final approval on Feb-
ruary 9. I voted in favor of this legislation which protects animals
from.abuse in shipment and extends prohibitions on animal fighting ven-
tures. A further proposal, H.R. 66, "A Bill to Discourage the Use of
Painful Devices in the Trapping of Animals and Birds," is now pending
in the Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation and the Environment Subcom—
mittee of the Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. The bill extends
new authority to the Secretary of the Interior to regulate trapping on
Federal lands. Though early consideration seems unlikely, hearings on
the bill are presently in progress.

It has been my consistent position that the Federal government should

take positive steps to extend protection to animals in interstate com—
merce and on Federal lands. As further proposals come to the House Floor,
I will certainly have the concerns evidenced by your inquiries in mind.

Thank you for your recent communication expressing opposition

to the proposed amendments to the Marine Mammal Protective Act,
H.R. 12460.

The proposed amendment regarding killer whales has resulted

in considerable mail from residents of the Fourth Congressional
District. The bill as proposed has been referred to the
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Subcommittee on Fisheries and
Wildlife Conservation. The bill is still pending action before
the Subcommittee, with nothing scheduled as of this date.

The proposals will be subjected to substantial review before
the Subcommittee and Full Committee eventually report a bill

in final form to the House for debate and action.

Your letter will be made part of the file which has been pre—
pared to assist me in the evaluation of H.R. 12460 when and

if it reaches the Floor of the House.

Dear Mrs. McAleenan:

In the absence of Congressman Johnson, who is in the District during the
Congressional Recess, I am taking the liberty of acknowledging receipt
of your letter of December 27.

As you may know, the Subcommittee on Livestock and Grains, House Commit!
tee on Agriculture, recently reported out the bill, H.R. 5808, to amend
the Animal Welfare Act. The Congressman, being a Member of that Subcom—
mittee,is very interested in this legislation, as well as other measures
affecting the treatment and welfare of our pets and livestock.

H.R. 5808 provides for amendments to the current law which would correct
many of the cruelities described in your pamphlet which occur during the
transportation of animals. Although this will not correct the entire
situation, it is a step in the right direction and I know Mr. Johnson was
very pleased that the bill was passed by the Subcommittee. The Full Com—
mittee has not yet scheduled action on H.R. 5808, but hopes to in the
near future.

Your letter will be brought to the Congressman‘s attention when he returns
to Washington.

Sincerely,

Dear Congressman James,

In response to yeur letter of April 26th, I regret that no scarce
of funds other than direct appeals to the public are generally avail~
able to humans sccieties. In some cases, contracts with cities are
entered into by humane societies for the handling of stray dog prob-
lems and housing animals being held fer claim by their owners or
adeptien into new homes.

It would be helgful if federal funds were available to assist in-
eties, but at the present time there is no such

serving humane soc
funding.

Sincerely,

April 7, 1981

have shown themselves extremely reluctant
in the past to get into a direct military con-
frontation withjhe other superpower. Their
knowledge that an American force with Eu-
ropean and Japanese support, however inad-
equate for prolonged hostilities, was poised
and ready to throw itself in the path of the
Soviet advance and would therefore have an
important deterrent effect. » 7 ‘

A Western force might also prove invalu-
,..,able in the face of other threats than that
of Soviet military intervention. In the case
of national rivalries leading to war in the
Gulf area a Western naval task force able to
keep open-the Straits of Hormuz might well
be required. In the case of domestic turmoil
threatening Western interests we should
need a capacity to intervene on the side of
any friendly power which called for help.
There are also many possible eventualities
calling for a quick deployment into the area
for defense of oil ﬁelds.

. If it is conceded to be in the interest of all
Western countries that some Western capa-
bility for deployment should exist, it follows
that those who beneﬁt should bear some of
the cost of its maintenance. The question is,
what constitutes a signiﬁcant and apprOw
priate contribution? .

The problem here is to some extent one of
public opinion, which in America tends to
, see Europe’s willingness to take part active~
_ ly in the protection of “European” oil in the

Middle East as a major touchstone of the

present relationship. From this point of.

View the more visible and directly related to
.the Middle East problem the European con-

tributions, the better. Even marginal assist»

ance from Europeans would be symbolically
important in ~ maintaining ' alliance cohesion,

' in demonstrating to the Soviets and the
countries of the region that the West is
united, ”and in persuading American public
opinion of the futility of a major US. effort
in the area. From a European point of View
it is also necessary to ensure, by direct in-
volvement, that the arrangement should be
based on shared reponsibility and. truly col-

- lective decision~making. A new reality needs

Lto be given to these principles where the
vital interests of the whole Western world
are at stake.

These considerations point to active Euro-
pean military participation on the ground
and at sea in the Middle East. There are po-
litical and practical difficulties about this
approach. The non-American: powers have
very limited resources available for long-
range operations, and it is arguable that for
them to try, at this stage, to create a capac-

’ ity which‘would make any appreciable dif-

ference to the military situation would cost
money that would be better spent on im-
proving"*\the quality of their forces in the
N ATO sector. Moreover, in the case of Ger-
many and Japan there are considerable mis-
givings inside and outside these countries
about. wl‘iether they should assume a global
military role for the first time since the end
of. World War II. ' ‘

For these reasons it seems best to adopt a
mixed. policy whereby the main burden of
putting together a rapid deployment force
falls on the United States, but the‘Europe‘

ans make some contribution in terms of men

and materiel where this is appropriate (as in
the case of Britain and Franceland/or pro-
vide en route facilities for the American
rapid deployment force, contribute to the
enhancement of the existing Western bases
in the area, and, by maintaining their own
defence expenditures in Europe, permit
some American resources to be released for
the Middle East. -
A European presence in the area would be
politically and symbolically important. It
would underline to European publics their
stake inzthe area; it would greatly help‘to

gain American congressional and public sup-
port for a major US; effort in the area; and
it would therefore improve American~Euro~
pean relations.

 

A TRIBUTE TO JEWISH‘
HERITAGE .

.._————-—— ,

HON. DOUG WALGREN 1 - * ‘
IN THEVHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Tuesday, April 7, 1981

0 Mr. WALGREN. Mr. Speaker, our
Nation is rich with ethnic and cultural
diversity. As immigrants have melted
into our communities, they have con»
tributed their spirit, talents, and tradi-
tions to our national identity. As a co-
sponsor of House Joint Resolution 155,
a bill proclaiming May 3' through May
10, 1981, “Jewish Heritage Week,” I
am pleased that the HouSe passed this
bill on March 26.

This week would be designated pri-
marily for educational ceremonies and
activities. Last year during Jewish
Heritage Week, many school systems
sponsored programs on Jewish history
and culture, Hebrew as a modern lan-
guage, the Holocaust, and current cone

, cerns of American Jews.

The months of April and May con=
tain many events important to Jewish
history including Passover, the annin
versary of the Warsaw ghetto upris-
ing, Israeli Independence Day, Solidar-
ity Sunday for Soviet Jewry, and J eru-
salem Day. Each of these events

marks an important period of Jewish‘

history that all of us, regardless of our
religion or ethnicity, should remem-

' ber.

During this week, while we. honor
the historical accomplishments of the
Jewish people, we should also

strengthen resolve to work on remain- .

ing problems. I believe we should also
express our concern for the most
recent Jewish emigrees from the
Soviet Union—who seek. refuge in var-
ious countries around the world from.
persecution in Russia. I have cospon-
sored House Concurrent Resolution 50,
to urge the Soviet Union to release
scientist Viktor Brailovsky, and House
J cint Resolution 220, to award honor~
ary citizenship to Raoul Wallenberg,
who heroically rescued many in Hum
gary during World War II. The fate of
Mr. Wallenberg is still unknown.
I hope that Jewish Heritage Week
will draw attention to the successes
and the stuggles of the Jewish people.
Through increased awareness of di-
verse cultures, we will all gain a great~
er understanding of our national heri~
:tage and build more bonds of friend-
ship among the many ethnic'groups in
our Nation. - , -- '-

THE ELEPHA PROTECTION 7
ACT OF 1981 - ' ’

HON.,ANTHONY c. BEILENSON .
OF CALIFORNIA ‘ ‘ ‘
IN THE HOUSE or REPRESENTATIVES

Tuesday, April 7, 1981

a Mr. BEILENSON; Mr. Speaker, 1 f

am introducing a bill today, along with .
56 of my colleagues, to halt the mas-l.
sive slaughter of African elephants,
The Elephant Protection Act of 1981',
identical to the bill, passed by}, the ‘

House 'of Representatives last ‘ CODn j

gress, "would restrict ivory imports

from African nations which do not . . '

curb the rampant killing of their couns :

try’s elephants.
Elephant populations in Africa are

rapidly diminishing. In' 1970, there ~ =*- "

were an estimated 5,000,000 elephants

in Africa. By 1980, the population of ',

elephants had dropped to 1,300,000.

After surviving for more than 300,000 g;
years as a species, the African ele-

Dhant is exrneriencing such a swift'de- ..,
cline in numbers that it is facing ex-p .

tinction.

While drought, deforestation, urban; "

ization, and competition With the rap-
idly increasing h'uman populatibn

have all contributed to the feet decline ,
in elephant populations, it is the delib- , "1‘ “c :1?

erate slaughter of elephants for their
valuable ivory‘ tusks that poses the

maining herds. Ivory trade alone isbeo .~

lieved to account for 50,000 to 150,000

elephant deaths, each year—édeath-s
which are mostly brought about by in:

resulted in numbers of elephant
deaths at various times, even when
man did not have the technical advan-
tages over elephants which he has
today. Like gold and silver, ivory is a
hard currency, a commodity that ina
creases in worth in times of inflation.
Ivory that brought a trader $3 a
pound in the 1960’s now brings $40 to
$50 a pound. International trade in
both raw and worked ivory is estimat~
ed to be worth $200 million or more
annually. High inflation in recent
years has caused the elephant to
become a most unfortunate victim of a
vicious supply~and~demand spiral. As
the price of ivory rises, more ele‘
phants are slaughtered. As more ele-
phants are killed, there is increased
fear that the supply will run out. In
turn, fear that the supply will run out
drives up the price even more.

The African elephant is following
the path of the near-extinct Asian eles
phant. The United States has banned
trade in Asian elephant ivory since
11.976 when the Department of the In-
terior officially listed these creatures
as an endangered species. Now that
Africa is the sole source of the ivory
trade, the African elephant is quickly
following the path toward endangered
status, too. It was not until I intro~
duced a bill to ban trade in ivory from
African elephants 4 years ago that the
Department of the Interior tpok any
action to protect the African elephant.
At that time, Interior. issued regula:
tions listing the African elephant as a

threatened species and allowing ivory‘

imports only from countries which are
parties to the Convention of Interna.
tional Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES).

Unfortunately, Interior’s regulations
have not been effective, Much ivory
entering this country still comes from
elephants which are killed illegally,
and is shipped through a vast world-
wide trade in smuggled elephant prod-
, ucts. Worked ivory from places such as
Hong Kong, where large amounts of
raw ivory are carved, is required to be
accompanied by a reexportation docu-
ment stating that the ivory was legally
taken in the country of origin. Howev-
er, it is almost impossible for US. Cus-
toms agents to verify documents
which have been falsified by attribut-
ing ivory origin to a CITES member
country when the ivory was actually
taken in a nonmember country.

But even more frustrating than the
falsification of documents is our Gov.
ernment’s failure to deal with obvious
fraud in elephant imports. Two years
ago, when the House Merchant
Marine and Fisheries Committee re-
. viewed some ivory import documents
obtained from the Department of the
interior they found some declarations
listing “Africa” as the country of
origin, and other declarations listing
“Kenya,” a country which has banned
the export of wildlife products since
1977. The ivory listed on these docu—
ments, and on other obviously errone»

‘reexports it. During the

bULVquSSION/ML QRECORD-QExtemiom of Remarks '

ous or fraudulent documents, successe
fully entered the United States.
Clearly, stronger action is needed to
halt the destruction of the African elem
phant than what is being taken under
current law, and we must act quickly
while we still have a chance to reverse
the decline of these magnificent anie
mals. During the last Congress I
worked with members and staff of the
Merchant 'Marine and Fisheries Come
mittee to devise a way to end our Nae
tion’s participation in the slaughter of
elephants and to esablish a system
whereby those countries which sues

cessfully manage their elephant popue ,

lations are recognized and encouraged.
l believe, as do numerous environmena
tal and animal protection Organiza-
tions whose representatives testified in
support of this bill, that the lelgislas
tion we developed would do just that.
The bill ll am introducing is identical
to HR. 4085 of last Congress—except
for necessary date changes. With
strong, bipartisan endorsement from
the Merchant Marine and Fisheries
Committee, this bill passed the House
of Representatives on December 19,
1979. In the Senate, the Subcommittee
on Resource Protection held a hearing
on this bill in June of 1980, but Senate
consideration of it was stalled as that
Chamber prepared for adjournment.
Brieﬂy, the bill would do the follow-
ing: First, it would impose a 6-month
moratorium on the import and export
of any elephant or elephant product
to or from the United States. The

moratorium would apply to both

worked and raw ivory. whether the
ivory comes directly from an ivory-ex-
porting country or from an intermedi-
ate country which works the ivory and
6-month
period, however, 10,000 pounds of
ivory would be exempt in order to
allow the 1,000 to 3,000 scrimshaw
artisans in this country to practice
their skill and maintain their 1iveli«
hood. lvory for this purpose is unavaila
able from any other source. In addie
tion, during the first 90-day period,
the bill would exempt worked ivory

purchased abroad by tourists which is ‘

not intended for resale.

During the moratorium, the Depart»
ment of the interior would develop a
permit program to allow ivory trade
with countries which meet strict crite-
ria. Permits would be granted for ivory
originating in countries which have
strong elephant conservation pro-

grams and sound recordkeeping for

their ivory exports. Permits would be
issued for ivory from intermediate
countries only if the reexporting
nation has sufficient recordkeeping re:
quirements to insure that the nation
of origin can be determined.

Provisions are made to assist the De
partment of the Interior in enforcing
restrictions on ivory trade. In order to
allow Interior to concentrate its en-
forcement efforts, elephant product
imports would be limited to the ports
of New York and Seattle. Violators
would face stiff penalties; First-time

April 7, 1.981

offenders would be subject to a civil

' penalty of $l0.000 and a criminal pen~

alty of $20,000 or 1 year imprisonment
or both. Second-time and subsequent
violators would face stronger penab
ties. ,

Exempt from coverage of this bill
would be imports and exports of ele»
phants and elephant products for zoo~
logical, educational, scientific, or exhiw
bitional purposes; keyboard ivory
which is part of a musical’instrument;
and elephant trophies taken by sports
hunters, previded that the imported
item is well-documented and taken in
compliance with the laws of the host
country. 2

Our bill would take an additional
step to aid conservation of elephants.
it would direct the Secretary of State
to establish programs to assist nations
in protecting habitat for elephants,
and in developing and implementing
elephant conservation and 'manage«
ment programs. This would help those
nations which want to conserve their
elephant populations but simply do
not have the capability to develop a
program without outside assistance.

Funding for this bill would be au~
thorized for the. next 4 years—fiscal
years 1982—85-at the following levels:
For the Department of Interior’s enn
forcement program, the bill would au-
thoriae $1.5 million for fiscal year
1982, and $2 million for the 3 subse-
quent fiscal years; for the State De-
partment’s conservation assistance
program, the bill would authorize
$400,000 in fiscal year 1982, $4."? mil~
lion in fiscal year 1983, $5.5 million in
fiscal year 1984, $7 million in fiscal

‘year‘ 1985, and $0.7 million in fiscal

year M86.

The proposals contained in this bill
present a better approach to reducing
elephant deaths than would a com-
plete ban of ivory trade such as I have
advocated in the past, because they
take a morepositive approach to solvs
ing problems of elephant conservation.
This bill’s distinct advantage over a
ban on ivory trade isthat it provides a
means to implement conservation pro-
grams in ivory-exporting countries,
and gives countries an incentive to

conserve their elephant populations:

We reward them by permitting their

ivory to be imported into our country.

It also refrains from punishing those
in industries for which there are no

' substitutes for elephant ivory—sin par—

ticular, for scrimshaw work and musi‘
cal instrument keyboards.

It would be unconscionable to allow
our desire for unnecessary luxury
items such as ivory carvings and jewel-
ry to continue to contribute to the
inhumane, extinction-threatening
slaughter of the largest land mammals
in the world. We can help put a stop
to this large-scale destruction of the
African elephant. Passage of our bill
will be an important step toward doing
50.. I .2.,..'..

I refer, of course, to my colleagues:
WILLIAM C. WAMPLER of Virginia, PAUL
FINDLEY of Illinois, TOM HAGEDORN of
. Minnesota, JOHN NAPIER of South
Carolina, and CLINT ROBERTS of South
Dakota.

I particularly want to commend BILL
WAMPLER not only for his‘ effective
leadership. of his fellow Republican
members but for his demonstrated di~
plom'acy in working with the Agricul-r
ture Committee’s majority in advanc-
ing the cause of farm families.

In the “Fighting Ninth” District of
southwestern Virginia, where politics
is a way of life, Congressman WAMPLER
has earned the distinctive and effec-
tionate nickname, “The Bald Eagle of
the Cumberlands.” ' His unflagging
work on behalf of sound farm policies
and constant vigilance against deficit
spending has earned “him national.
esteem.

The relationship between farm
policy and sound fiscal policy was the
keystone of BILL WAMPLER’S legislative
work in agriculture. The gentleman
from Virginia correctly reflected farm—
ers' feelings when he said on more
than one occasion that bringing infla-
tion and high-interest rates under con—
trol would be the best farm program
that the Congress and the administra-
tion could provide.

Time and space will not permit me
to recount the many fine legislative ef~
forts of BILL WAMPLER, so let me just
touch on a few as indicative of the ef-
fective efforts he has made in the
course of his 18 years in the Congress.

BILL WAMPLER has long been known
on Capitol Hill as “Mr. Agriculture Re—
search” because of his constant work
in championing the cause of agricul-
tural research, extension, and teach
ing in the United States.

BILL was the author and prime
mover of title XIV of the 1977 Farm
Act which sought to reverse a decade

ERESSIONAL RECORD?”- HOUSE

* more of decline in research, exten-
on, and teaching in the food and ag-
~cultural sciences by authorizing a
ramatic, 5-year increase in funds of
xisting programs in those sciences at
so Federal, regional, and State levels.
That Act also initiated new research,
rtension, and education programs in
ie hope that these new initiatives
ould enhance food and agricultural
productivity geared to this Nation’s
future needs. ‘

In 1981, displeased with the lack of

enough progress in carrying out the.

initiatives authorized in the 1977 Farm
Act, BILL WAMPLER again took the
leadership introducing amendments to
make clear the original intent of the
Congress in establishing the National
Agricultural Research, Extension, and

Teaching Policy Act (title XIV)~—-this

time to make it perfectly clear that
the Congress expects the executive
branch to reinforce the historic State-
Federal partnership in the research,
extension, and teaching programs in
the food and agricultural sciences.

One of the first results of this revi-
talized effort, enacted as a new title
XIV of the Agriculture and Food Act
of 1981, was the appointment of a new
and added Assistant Secretary of Agri-
culture to maintain a continuing oven
sight of the objectives of title XIV.

In the pesticides area, BILL WAMPLER
worked actively in support of HR.
5203 which provided for a 2—year ex-
tension of the Federal Insecticide,
Fungicide, and Rodenticide act
(FIFRA) and, more importantly, con-
taining amendments which responded
to many problems identified since
FIFRA was last amended in 1978.

Mr. WAMPLER long has been recog—
nized as one of the members most fa-
miliar with FIFRA and one of the an.
thors of the amendment included in
FIFRA which established the Scientiﬂ
ic Advisory Panel and the amendment
to provide peer review of the scientific
decisions emanating from the Envirdn~
mental Protection Agency with regard
to pesticide registrations and regula-
tions. BILL WAMPLER supported and
fought for strengthening amendments
to our pesticide legislation to maintain
the needed balance to enable EPA to

continue to protect the health and.

safety of the public and pesticide users
while allowing farmers and producers
to benefit from modern, cost-effective
chemical pest control technologies.
The gentleman from Virginia long
has been an ardent advocate of sound
scientifically based food safety policy.
In June 1981, he cosponsored legislac
tion to consider a number of changes
in present food safety policies. Among
other provisions of the bill was a re
quirement that the banning of a food
additive be based on a scientific find-
ing of significant risk to human
health, rather than the absolute “zero
risk” principal required under the
present law’s so-calleQDelaney clause.
BILL WAMPLER has always had a
strong interest in food and nutrition
issues. He has said on many occasions

.311

Date: US$242! I 25.4..

M

H 107 21

that he supports the food stamp prOe
gram and that the program, when it
helps the elderly and the disabled and ’
those low-income people who are in‘

need, is a very humanitarian program.

However, BILLhas expressed his con«
cern about the growth and the-cost'of
the food stamp program and thus has .
supported those actions that eliminate
fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.

There is no question in my mind —
that BILL WAMPLER’S wise and compass
sionate leadership will be sorely
missed.

Another of our colleagues who will
be missed is PAUL FINDLEY of Illinois,
intelligent, articulate legislator
who has championed the cause of
market—oriented agriculture since he
was first elected to Congress in 1960.

In the 97th Congress, PAUL FINDLEY .
was a leader in the administration’s .
fight to reduce Government involve
ment in agriculture, first introducing
the administration’s farm bill, and
then working hard with his Agricul-
ture Committee colleagues to assure
that the final bill would provide farm
income protection without breaking
the U.S. Treasury. ‘

PAUL is a man of strong convictions,
not to be deterred because his position
may not always be the most popular.
He has not been afraid to take on. the
tough issues. I remember well how he
led the fight to introduce ﬂexibility .
into the dairy price support program,
maintaining that the long-term inter-
ests of dairy farm families would be
better served by, keeping dairy pro-

' gram costs under control rather than

run the risk of burdensome costs;
which could cause the programto be
eliminated. -

PAUL FINDLEY has constantly con—
tended that farm economic problems
cannot be solved by inflationary
Treasury outlays; that throwing
money at these problems often makes
them worse instead.

PAUL FINDLEY’S market orientation _
philosophy does not stop at home. He‘
believes that you cannot have a
market-oriented domestic policy if you
do not have a market-oriented foreign
policy. That is why he was out front in
convincing President Reagan to lift
the Carter embargo on U.S. grain sales
to the Soviet Union. ' ’

Through his position as a senior
member of both the Agriculture Com-
mittee and the Foreign Affairs Com-v
mittee, Congressman FINDLEY has
been a leader in US. efforts to elimi- -
nate nontariff trade barriers and
unfair export subsidies of foreign com-
petitors. He led successful U.S. efforts
to head off European Economic Com-
munity restrictions on imports of US.
corn gluten feed. He strongly support-
ed President Reagan’s efforts to test
the General Agreement on Tariffs and .
Trade (GATT) to see whether it can
be relied on to assure fair market
access for US. farm products. ‘

PAUL has supported the expansion of

program, believing that this Nation’s
aid policies, in, addition to serving hu-
manitarian needs, should'be coordinat-
ed ‘with two-way trade objectives to
build markets for U.S. products. '

While a strong supporter of Govern-
ment efforts to assure adequate nutri-
tion for poor people in this country
and overseas, PAUL FINDLEY recognizes
- the value and diginity of American
_- principles regarding work. For this
reason, he might be called the Mr.
Workfare of the Congress. Under
workfare, able-bodied people work for
‘ "their food stamps. As a result of FIND-
LEY.’_S workfare initiatives in the food
, stamp program, Congress adopted a
Findley amendment to expand the
workfare program to any community
that wants to participate in it. ,.

As - the fourth ranking minority
member of ' the Agriculture Commit-
tee, TOM HAGEDORN was one 'of the
most effective leaders in defending the
needs of American agriculture. "'

‘ Tomawas the ranking Republican on
the LiVestock, Dairy, and POultry Sub-
‘_ Committee, in the 97th Congress. In
that position, he was instrumental in
dealing with the major problems con-
fronting these vital sectors of agricul—
. ture. '
. . “He was very active in working to pre-
serve the integrity of the dairy price
support program, a program that has
been beset with a huge supply-demand
Mbalance resulting in record levels of
Government price support purchases
of dairy products. Mr. HAGEDORN
worked closely With the administra-
tion and with representatives of pro-
ducer, industry, and consumer groups
to develop effective legislation to
make equitable adjustments and bring
Government costs under control.
-' . TOM has introduced and cosponsored
legislation in the areas of meat and
poultry inspection, improvement of
food safety laws, animal disease con
'trol, easing of import duties on animal
. drugs necessary for U.S. herds, and

humane treatment of horses during
the course 0 ransportation.
TOM HAGEDORN was an ardent sup-

. porter of movement toward free trade

and improving our status as a reliable
supplier Of agricultural products in
world. markets. He strongly opposed
the 1,980: grain embargo and intro-
, duced recently passed legislation that
preserves the integrity of our agricul—
tural export contracts in the event of
. a trade embargo.

He believed that Congress should
uphold the philosophy of reliance on
‘the market place to sustain farm
income and not place the burden on
the Federal Government. To that end,
he pressed for better utilization of ex—
isting export credit programs. In addi»
tion, he introduced bills that have
' sincebecome law to expand of agricul-
tural commodities, particularly dairy
products. ‘ .

_ TOM was particularly concerned with
the specific trade problems that the
United States has encountered in ex-

porting .farm comr‘nodities’." He intro-

Monday, Fcbramy 23,1981

G Mr. JEFFQRDS. Mi. Speaker, today
I am introducing a resolution to pro-
claim March .1, 1.981, the National Day
of the Seal. This resolution is meant
to celebrate the {airth of the seal
rather than its oft-en brutal death,
which has frequently been noted in
the past. March 1 has been proclaimed
the International Day of the Seal in
many nations In the UnitedS 15.,ates
the focus of the iesmiiics is New York
City, where the Paul Winter Conscrt
will give two benefit concerts in the
Cathedral. of St, John the Divine.

 

March 1 is a particularly significant
rnal cycle of the harp ;

,’ day in the eie
seal, Each year around this time,

about 400,000 harp seal pups are born 1
off the coast oi Newfoundland and in ¥

the Gulf of St, Lawrence. In the first 2

months of their lives, approximately ‘

180,000 of them will be killed before

their bright 11111136 coat begins to molt ,

and turns to the g1 ay adult coat

Much has been made of the often

brutal and inhumane method of kills
ing these animals. The hunt is eons
ducted by Canadian and Norwegian

nationals under the supervision of the .
Canadian Government, which justifies ;
the “harvest” on the grounds of herd f
management techniques that are sup. y

posed to allow the herd to increase.
However, a recent study by two popu-
lation dynamics experts concluded
that the methods used to determine

quotas contained biases that led to un- ‘
derestimations of both the decline of ‘j

the stock and the natural mortality
rate. Nevertheless, the quotas remain
unchanged and will be filled in the
next 2 months.

Many US. citizens have expressed

outrage over the clubbing that is used '

, to kill the seal pups. On March 1, how-
, ever, we can project a more positive,
, upbeat feeling about the seal by cele-

“ brating its birth. I urge my colleagues 3
, to support this resoulution and ob- ‘

serve the International Day of the
Seal in any manner they see fit,
The resolution follows:
:11. Con. Res. 72

1981, as National Day of the Seal

Be it enacted by theSenate and House of
Representatives of the United States of
America. in Congress assembed,

Whereas the seal is an essential and in-
separable part of the marine ecosystem, and

Whereas the seal, of which there are some
33 species, is a land mammal that returned
to the oceans 20 to 30 million years ago, and

Whereas the presence of the seal helps
maintain the health and balance of this en-
vironment, and

Whereas the presence of the seal is an in-

dication of a whole and healthy ecosystem, ‘

Wheieas the seal is a social carnivore with
