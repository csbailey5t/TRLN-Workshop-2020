In the hope of further ﬁxing public attention on this vital
question, I complied with a request to prepare a paper for that
able, and eldest among the American Magazines, T he North
American Review, which was published in the July Edition of
last year, under the title of “ The Cost of Cruelty.”

THE RADCLIFFE ESTATE.

The will of that kind hearted lady, Mrs. Catharine H.
Radcliffe, a generous benefactress of this Society, has been
completely settled to the satisfaction of all parties interested,
and a ﬁnal discharge from the Surrogate is now in the Archives.
of this Institution.

THE BROOKLYN AGENCY.

After years of experience as to the futility of establishing a
permanent Branch Society in Brooklyn, I have abandoned
further attempts in that direction—but instead thereof have
appointed an Agency at 415 Fulton street, with Mr. J. R. Pye
at its head, but directly responsible to these headquarters.
Hereafter, the citizens of Long Island can make their com-
plaints at that admirably appointed ofﬁce, with the assurance
that they will meet with prompt attention. The urgent neces-
sity of a representation of our cause in that important city, is
acknowledged by its inhabitants, and I should long ago have
undertaken it, but, for fear of augmenting too greatly the
expenses of our work.

I know you will pardon the seeming egotism of my language,
when I say that no duty imposed on me by my ofﬁcial position,
receives a more zealous watchfulness, than its ﬁnancial affairs.
The institution is now, and ever has been, entirely out of debt,
as the Treasurer, Mr. Charles Lanier’s Report annually con--
ﬁrms—and in that reSpect, as well as others, I trust, presents
an example worthy of imitation.

I fail to discover any sufﬁcient reason for concealing the good
deeds, and names too, of the real benefactors of our own, or
the inferior race of animals; hence with all possible respect

for that sentiment of delicacy, which is ever an accompaniment
of true benevolence, I cannot resist the temptation to say, that
to Mr. Horace B. Claﬂin, and to Mr. George I. Seney, the
cause of humanity on Long Island, is indebted for the pecu-
niary aid which has planted there an efficient defense to the
brute creation.

THE SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF
CRUELTY TO CHILDREN.

It is also a pleasure for me to report to you the augmented
prosperity and usefulness of the above-named Institution——
the legitimate offspring of your Society—under the able and
indefatigable labors of its President, Mr. Elbridge T. Gerry,
"and Mr. Lewis L. Delaﬁeld, its counsel.

HENRY BERGH,
President.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

The Executive Committee of the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, have to congratulate the
members and friends of the cause upon the continued pros—
perity of the parent society, and the increasing Spread of the
work of defending dumb animals throughout the country.

It has to report the lamented death of several liberal and
warm-hearted friends of the cause, during the past year, as
mentioned in the obituary notice in this report.

The omnipotent enemy of man, and all created things,
Death, within the brief space of one month removed from the
sphere of their usefulness, two of the prominent friends of the
«cause of humanity to the brute creation.

Mr. James Stokes, whose long life was passed within the
walls of this city, on Monday, 1st November, 1881, passed
peacefully away, in the enjoyment of the profound esteem and
respect of all who knew him. It may be said that his whole
existence was a concrete expression of charity and benevolence.

At the time of his decease, Mr. Stokes was a member of the
Executive Committee of this Society, and as such, always
manifested a conspicuous sympathy with its cause, and at his
death gave generously of his means, to forward its civilizing
and humane purposes.

Mr. Matthew Vassar, who died on the 10th November, was
:also a sincere and active disciple of the cause of animal pro-
tection, and at his death was President of the Branch Society
of this State, located at Poughkeepsie, and to which he be-
queathed a liberal legacy.

The family name he bore, has long been associated with
good deeds of almost every kind; and countless generations
will continue to reap the benefits of education, so wisely and
so generously provided them by his kindred and himself.
Suffering humanity, too, will long have cause to remember his
'benefactions.

They also report the election by the Board of Managers of
Mr. Anson Phelps Stokes to the vacancy on the list of the
Executive Committee, caused by the death of his father, the
late Mr. James Stokes.

Resolved: That the thanks of the Society be, and they are
‘ hereby tendered to the President, Henry Bergh, for his
judicious and accurate care in the management of the estate
of the late Catherine H. Radcliffe, and for the generous dona-
tion to the Society of his fees, amounting to $357.7 7, which
legally accrues to him as executor to the estate.

Also, the thanks of the Society to Elbridge T. Gerry, Esq.,
for kindly donating several volumes of legal books to the
library of the Society.

They refer the members to the reports of the President,
Treasurer, and Secretary, for details of the work performed
by the Society, and its ﬁnancial condition.

Since the organization of the Society in 1866, it has prose-
cuted in the Courts, nine thousand one hundred and twenty-
one cases of cruelty to animals, and its Agents have interfered
and prevented the abuse of animals in twenty-one thousand
two hundred and ninety—one cases, in New York, Kings, Queens
and Richmond Counties alone. The offenders were not pro—
secuted in the Courts, as the cases hardly warranted such
proceeding ; but the evils were remedied and the animals
saved from further cruelty.

During the past‘year these cases numbered twelve hundred
and seventyolive, as follows :

Horses attached to street cars ................................... 182

AMBULANCE AND DERRICK WORK.

The services of the ambulances and derrick of the Society
were called into requisition on two hundred and tweny-one
occasions, to remove disabled animals from the streets, or to
rescue them from excavations into which they had fallen.

LECTURES AND CORRESPONDENCE.

The President has delivered during the past year several
lectures before associations and societies, but a large and
continued correspondence with kindred societies at home and
abroad, has compelled him to decline many other invitations
to lecture out of town.

THE BROOKLYN AGENCY.

This Agency, although only opened on the 1st November
last, is in full working order, and since that date the ofﬁcers
attached to it prosecuted twenty-three cases in the Brooklyn
Courts, and interfered and prevented cruelty in 106 other
cases. They were also called upon to humanely destroy seventy-
seven animals condemned as unﬁt for further use. One hundred
and ninety-two complaints from citizens had also been investi-

gated and the evils complained of remedied.

BRANCHES AND AGENCIES.

The Society has 16 Branches and 230 Agencies, and the
number is gradually increasing. It is hoped ere long this
Society will have its representative in every town and village
throughout the State.

SPREAD OF THE WORK THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY.

It is very gratifying to report that the cause is gradually
spreading. Nearly every State in the Union have laws for the
protection of animals, with societies in active operation to
enforce the humane enactments. From the Atlantic to the

 




 

17

Paciﬁc the civilizing humanity has taken root, spreading an
inﬂuence which cannot be retarded, and causing to spring up
in the minds of thinking peOple the necessity of having inscribed
on the Statute books, laws for the protection of unofi‘ending
animals from the cruelty of man.

VIVISECTION.

The attention of our readers is called to a volume on the
above important subject, scientiﬁcally and ethically considered,
in prize essays, by James Macauley, A. M., M. D., Fellow of
the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh ; the Rev. Brewin
Grant, B. A., Vicar, St. Paul’s Bethnal Green, London, E. ;
Abiathar Wall, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians,
Edinburgh, and member of the Royal College of Surgeons,
England, etc.

The Donor of the Prize for these Essays says he hOpes “to
increase the knowledge of the peOple on the subject of Vivi—
section, not only as to the extent to which It is practiced, but
also as to its fruitlessness as a method of physiological investi-
gation. The subject is overlooked by a considerable number
of persons, because it has never. been brought before them in
such a way as would command their attention, and be easily
understood by them. These Essays are admirably adapted
for that purpose ; being written by able, educated men, who
have made Vivisection a study, and have traversed the whole
ﬁeld in a brief and lucid manner. It is of importance, therefore,
that the friends of the cause should make a special effort to
secure a large circulation for this volume, more particularly
among those who are outside the circle of the Anti—Vivisection
Societies, and those already interested in this subject. By
this means, increased interest will be awakened, and the num—
ber of the friends of the cause multiplied.

The book is published by Marshall J app & C0,, of London,
but copies can be obtained at the Headquarters of the Society,
in New York, price, $1.50.

Respectfully submitted,
T. W. HARTFIELD,
Acting Secretary.

cates, and in its columns the more important proceedings of the
Society have been given to the public. Short stories, sketches
and other interesting miscellany, appropriate to the character
of the paper, have tended largely to increase its circulation,
and make it valuable as a household journal.

TRANSPORTATION OF CATTLE.

I wish it were in my power to report to you a radical reform
in the mode of transportation of animals, and their general
treatment.

The American Humane Association, which has long had
this subject under consideration, reported at its last meeting,
held in Boston, at which I attended, that the award of ﬁve
thousand dollars to the inventor of an improved cattle car,
had not resulted in procuring one acceptable to the Committee
of that Association, notwithstanding the fact that 700 models
had been submitted. In view of that statement, I felt con-
strained to address the Convention of Societies there assembled,
on the propriety of doing something without further delay.
To that end I advised, that, from among the vast number of
inventions, one possessing the greatest merit be accepted, even
if not quite as perfect as might be desired, and leave it to
time and experience to improve on it.

Such a course seems to commend itself, because of the
present inhuman means employed, as it would hasten an
amelioration of the dreadful sufferings of animals destined for
human food, and moreover proportionately diminish the con-
sequent risks to the consumers of their ﬂesh. In support of
this suggestion, I took occasion to direct the attention of the
Convention to the wonderful rise and progress of the Adams
and American Express Companies, and still later the Drawing
Room Car Companies, all of which sprang from an absolute
necessity experienced by the public, analogous to this one
which has so long been held in abeyance. ‘

With the adoption of the best invention attainable at the
present time, there is little doubt, as in the cases before cited,
that corporations would immediately be formed and competi—
tion ensue, which would result in greatly shortening the time
of transit, and an augmentation, if not an entire reform in
the whole service. Indeed such overtures have been already
received by me, in response to the published remarks, which
I felt constrained to make.

PRESIDENT’S REPORT.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SOCIETY:

The Sixteenth year of labor in the humane and civilizing
duty of protecting from abuse and cruelty, those humble
creatures which give dignity, wealth and happiness to man-
kind, is this day numbered with the past.

At this time, your thoughts naturally drift to the enquiry,
What has been achieved during that long period Of time,
almost equaling a fourth part of the alloted life time of man ‘9

An adequate answer to that question would ﬁll volumes,
upon each page of which might be found recorded, untiring
energy and success. ‘

From nothing, something is, if I may sospeak, and has
become a guiding principle in the conduct, it is hOped and
believed, of millions in our country, who habitually ignored
their duties to the inferior animals. The altered condition for
the better of that one most useful to man, the horse, is
generally conceded, and a sentiment of consideration, if not
tenderness for all, has supplanted that of wide-spread indif—
ference.

The practice of those alluring virtues, pity and forbearance,
carries along with, it its own reward, and human society
receives its share, in a more improved. tone of personal inter—
course.

As the immortal Shakespeare has said :

“The quality of mercy is not strained ;
It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven,
Upon the place beneath ; it is twice blessed,
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.” .

PIGEON SHOOTING.

A hideous spectacle on Long Island, last summer, shocked
public propriety, in the form of a Pigeon shoot, which lasted
eight days; during which time, it is admitted, twenty thousand
of that beautiful and harmless race of beings were mutilated
and killed, in order to afford occupation and amusement, for
an association of idle men, calling itself the “New York
Association for the Protection of Fish and Game.”

It would be difﬁcult to invent a title more inapplicable to
, that heartless concern. How the cruel and unsportsmanlike
tearing of the body and limbs of a beautiful and innocent
bird, in order to determine the skill, and possessor of wagers
of money, furniture and other coveted articles, can be strained
into affording protection to ﬁsh and game, overtaxes the
human mind to conceive.

It is pleasant however to know that this barbarous “ sport”
Whose suitable parallel is furnished by the Spanish bull ﬁght,
was condemned by public sentiment, and the press, from one

“end of our country to the other. It is hardly necessary to say,
that your Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, along with all the force at his
command was on the ground the ﬁrst day, but as the law did
not provide him adequate power to interfere, and the promo-
ters of the orgie were insensible to his prayers and admoni-
tions, he retired without being able to avert this disgrace
inﬂicted on American civilization.

He however lost no time in preparing a Bill to the Legisla—
ture, which was introduced to the Senate by the Hon. Mr.
Strahan, and passed by that body with‘only two opposing
votes. In the Assembly the Hon. Mr. Niles took charge of it,
and strove hard to effect its adoption, but the political chaos,
which so long reigned over the Legislature of this State, and
ﬁnally culminated in such fatal and disastrous consequences to
the beloved President of this Nation, rendered further action
impossible. Let us liOpe for better success in the future.

VIVISEOTION.

That grim monster Vivisection still remains master of the
situation. It is neither necessary nor appropriate, to lay before
you the countless fallacies, which compose the woof and warp
of this fearful scourge, boldly and deﬁantly inﬂicted on unof-
fending animals, with no other possible result, as is declared
by some of the most eminent surgeons and physiologists of
both hemispheres, than to give an unenviable éclat to desperate
experimenters, while destroying in their breasts every vestige
of pity, which should be a supreme characteristic of the disci-
ples of the healing art.

I last year lectured on this subject before a very large
audience in Association Hall; and am at this time engaged in
the preparation of another lecture, composed of entirely fresh
matter, for delivery the present season.

Although my efforts have not been productive of any legal
enactments, consolation is derived from the assurances of
several prominent physicians, that they have occasioned a
more careful thought, and considerate practice than heretofore
existed.
