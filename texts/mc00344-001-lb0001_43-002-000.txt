Regulatory Analysis and Development Staff

PPD, APHIS, USDA Comments on 9 CFR Part 3
Hyattsville,-MD 20782 REFERENCE: Docket No. 87~004

Dear Ms. WWight:

As a representative of the RI Animal Rights Coalition and a
member of The Humane Society of the U.S., the International Society
of Animal Rights, and the International Fund for Animal Welfare,

I wish to submit comments to the U.S.D.A. regarding the Animal
welfare Act amendments.

First of all, let's do the maximum we can do for primates—~
enlarge all their cages and keep them out of isolation, both in
the Laboratory and at the zoo! If some researchers insist on
isolation, let it be for a SHORT time and give those primates
additional personal attention and companionship. I have seen
pitiful photos of primates in solitary cages, reaching out to
touch others. Please prioritize the recommendations of Jane Goodall
and other experts in this field of concern.

All captive animals, including dogs, cats, rabbits, and monkeys,
need larger cages: Monkeys’ cages could be doubled in size, at
low cost, by joining two existing cages and allowing two compatible
primates to share the doubled space.

And PLEASE, require laboratories and dog dealers to provide
at least one hour per day of exercise and human companionship
(petting and stroking) for their dogsili These dogs lead solitary
and bleak lives in the lab, not to mention the stress they endure
from experiments. Let's get this exercise and socialization
provision written into the law:

I am disturbed that a research facility could take up to three
"CT +n manavrn 4‘14“: was}; «war-‘4- 1 . .v 6......”ng J— ..- a M ‘1 A ' "V
-ear to awuvvate their yledUe nouSing. solely, they Cdu do this

in less time and should be required to take this seriously enough
to act quickly!

We must remember that captive animals are being exploited
every day. They are all stressed and many suffer and die. We are
told by the biomedical researdh industry that these pursuits persist
for the benefit of human beings. Therefore, if non—human animals
are held in service to us, then we, as human beings, MUST protect
them and enhance their well—being, both physical and psychological,
while they are in our custody.

Thank you for your attention to these grave concerns.
Sincerely,

f? ‘ (*

Dear Ms. 8tevens:

I learned about 3our work and 3our worth3 organisation
while researchina m3 enclose8 article “rout the D*”ise test
on rabbits.

While readihs the Oct. 14 lame issue of hoience hagasihe,
I came across the n90 a re oort on the use oi laboratory a1iimals
in research. I heartily a3plaud 3ou ior not sisniab that
report! I completely endorse and want to further 3our stand
against the "unnecessary suffering,” ”poor research using
excessive~numhers of animals,” and the perverted thinsing that
humans have no moral obligation to animals.

 

Is there some wa3 in which I could volunteer my services?
.as a freelance writer experienced in medical.writin§ and routine

news and feature stories, I might be able to help. 1'8 be

interested in finding out more about the wnl al welfare Institute
u .. . ,. ., _ _ 4 1 I just

learned that U.8. Congressman 9ohert J. Frazeh (Democrat from

8uiiolh 00., NY) needs support in re introduCIns his 9st

”rotection act (would prevent seizure oi """ irals iro sEelters

and pounds to be used ior research).

nope 3ou 'll find a iew minutes to answer my letter and

As the promise of spring ap-
proaches, we see cheerful Easter
symbols everywhere --— colorful
Easter eggs, candy set cozily in
golden baskets, all enveloped in
the warm embrace of that soft,

,. . cuddly mass of fur and spring

3 iove we call the Easter bunny.
The words “bunny” and “rab-

j . ~ bit” are often used synonymously
' in our culture. Rabbits rank with

dogs and cats as precious pets in
many a household across this

land. It is rather sad to con-
“ z» *4 template,
season of the Easter bunny, the

‘ innocent rabbit and the cruel ex- 3

during this joyful

, perimentation it has been sub-
' jected to for over 44 years in

‘ laboratories all over America.
Cosmet1cs ﬁrms are the prin-

_- i cipal users of the widespread and
dreadful Draize test, a procedure
in which makeup, drugs, and
household products are tested.

Painfully toxic substances are in-

~ . .3. .31 jected into the eyes of bound rab-

bits. According to SCIENCE

magazine, rabbit eyes are much
" more sens1t1ve than human eyes.

Local anesthesia is rarely used
during the testing. Many of the
:same cosmetics firms test their
shaving products on those long,
velvety ears of our Easter bunny.

" ', .The ears are often severed and
-. 3 the rabbits killed.

The Draize test is so ﬂec-
3 tionable that eleven years ago in-

The Easter Bunny and Its Tale of Sacrifice

dividuals concerned with animal
welfare began to call for its halt.
Since then, scientific magazi es
have described and photogra . d
the disfigured eyes of rabbit vic-
tims. The CBS program 48
HOURS recently featured the
test in its telecast about the

animal rights movement in the

United States. Public sentiment
persisted, the procedure has
gradually been reduced by about
50 percent because testing was
found to be redundant and
sometimes even unnecessary.

The NEW YORK TIMES
reported two months ago that a
growing number of toxicologists
believe that the Draize test is a
poor one. Researchers are now
looking for alternatives to this
much publicized and maligned
testing program. A forerunner,
the Noxell Corporation
(manufacturer of Noxzema
creams and Cover Girl
cosmetics) has just begun to test
its own alternative; it is using
tissue cultures in laboratory
dishes instead of injecting toxic
substances into the eyes of rab—
bits. As reported in the TIMES
article, the company claims that
it is achieving comparable
results in more than 90 percent of
its tests on 38 cosmetics! Several
other cosmetics firms do not use
animals at all in their product
research.

humane alternatives to the
Draize test, SCIENCE magazine
bemoans the fact that although
the parties involved have begun
to cooperate and to show more
flexibility, the going is tough and
slow. New testing requires long
validation periods. Industry now .
recognizes the need to estabiish
time frames and to pool test data
so that the results can be shared
among the various industries. ;

This is crucial to reducing the

number of rabbits used.
The bottom line is this:

The Draize test horror began] .-

almost 50 years ago. The race to
end it was launched in 1978. Let’s
hope that one Easter soon can, f

truly be called “The Year of the.

Dear Sylvie.

Here's a COpy of the geture article I mentioned. There is
every reason to do nonwanimal tests to sort out the 50,000
chemicals we‘re all exposeé to. I wonder whether the one
your‘re detecting by smell might be rejected if the tests
were done.

Did Clare ever tell you about the article in §;§Q«Magazine
that resulted in the first federal law to protect laboratory
animals? It wee her advice to take over photographs of

dogs on the premises of dog ﬁealere to Henry Luce that
brought it about. gggg received more mail on that article
then any other ever published.

.Beet wishes

Sincerely,

THE CLAIRE LEWIS AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE IRyQDURNgLrsM

PURPOSE OF THE AWARD

 

Claire Lewis, a successful Dallas businesswoman and current
president of Animal Advocates, has long been a champion of animal
justice. She offers this award in the hope it will encourage the
media not only to continue its promotion of reSponsible pet owner—
ship but also to broaden its in—depth coverage of animal abuses and
exploitation. Success stories are welcomed as well as those report—
ing the darker side, and we encourage entries in a variety of cate-
gories such as neWSpaper columns, feature stories, magazine articles,
club publications, humane society newsletters, photography or art.

JUDGES SHALL INCLUDE A REPRESENTATIVE FROM A HUMANE ORGANIZATION WHO HAS WORKED EFFECTIVELY
FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS, A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS LEADER WHO HAS WORKED FOR COMMUNITY IMPROVEMENT,
AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE JOURNALISM DEPARTMENT OF A TEXAS COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY.

TONI DESTEFANO

For the past 23 years, Toni
DeStefano has dedicated her life
to improving the plight of home—
less, abused, or suffering ani-
mals as she steadfastly has main-
tained animals have rights and
are worthy of humane treatment.

She began her tireless cru-
sade in Wichita Falls, Texas, by
spearheading a drive to clean up
a local ghetto—like shelter con-
sisting of filthy, ramshackle
holding pens filled with starving,
sick animals. Under DeStefano's
leadership as its first and only
Executive Director, the Humane
Society of Wichita County steadily
has improved and expanded until
today it is recognized as a model
for other shelters to emulate.

Though on 24-hour daily call,
DeStefano accepts no salary. In
addition, she actively lobbies in
Austin for passage of humane leg-
islation and assists with animal
control certification courses
across Texas. She also is active
with the Humane Society of the
United States and was coordinator
for the 1985 HSUS regional work—
shop involving humane societies
from four states.

Convinced that education is
the only solution to animal prob-
lems, DeStefano eagerly speaks to
school groups, clubs, civic or—
ganizations, or individuals.

HENRY S. MILLER, JR.

Henry Miller entered the bus-
iness world in 1931 as a life un—
derwriter for Bankers Life Company
of Des Moines, later becoming one.
of the first chartered life under-
writers in Dallas.

He left insurance in 1938 to
join the Henry S. Miller Company,
a real estate firm in Dallas. A
3—year military stint interrupted
his career as he served in Italy
and North Africa as a major with
the U.S. Army.

On returning to civilian life,
he rejoined Henry S. Miller Com—
pany. He now serves as Chairman
of the Board on this, the largest
real estate brokerage and manage-
ment firm in the Southwest.

A steadfast supporter of the
arts, Miller has served as director
of numerous organizations, includ-
ing TACA, Greater Dallas Youth Or-
chestra, Dallas Classical Guitar
Society, Dallas Opera Company,
Dallas Ballet, and Dallas Histori—
cal Society. Miller also has been
a leader of numerous civic and
real estate organizations.

For his dedicated guidance
over the years, Miller has re-
ceived numerous distinguished ser—
vice awards, the most recent being
the 1986 Sesquicentennial Shining
Hours Award presented by the
Public Relations Society.

PAMELA J. SHOEMAKER

Teacher, adviser, editor,
author, communication consultant,
and lecturer--Dr. Shoemaker dis—
plays a variety of talents.

As assistant professor with
the Department of Journalism at
the University of Texas at Austin,
Dr. Shoemaker teaches communica-
tion theory, research methodology,
magazine editing, and acts as de-
partmental graduate adviser. She
also conducts numerous magazine
and newsletter workshops. Her
articles frequently appear in
magazines such as Journalism
Quarterl , and she—has received
a number of important grants in-
volving mass communication sur—
veys and experiments.

Growing up in rural Ohio,
Shoemaker had many animal friends
over the years, including cats,
dogs, horses, geese, goats, and
mules. But she admits having a
special place in her heart for
ducks, especially 10—year—old
Huey who spends cold winters in
the basement of her parent's Ohio
home and hot summers in their
backyard child's swimming pool
provided for his enjoyment.

Shoemaker and her husband
John share their home with B.C.
and Buckaroo, both former strays
that gravitated to what Shoemaker
describes as the ”designated
neighborhood cat haven.”

Killing 0f Animals
Nothing To Celebrate

Everyone has a Spiritual homeland, if that
is not too fancy a phrase. And his spiritual
homeland is not always necessarily the place
he happened to be born in or grew up in.

For instance, whenever I travel in North
Carolina, visiting such mountain hamlets as
Flat Rock, Saluda and Tryon, my soul feels
majestic. I experience a true feeling of “purple
majesty," a sense of peace and serenity.

Which is not to say, of course, that I adOpt,
en toto, EVlslliY'I‘l-llNG about my spiritual
homeland. For every homeland has its own
temper. its» own cultural warp, and the customs
of a spiritual homeland might not mesh with
my own.

Which brings me, again, to this rather
jarring mention of the Coon Dog Day Celebra-
tion in Saluda, N.C. ~— (the first Saturday after
the Fourth of July) —~ where, at one point in
the activities, a helpless racoon on a pond raft
is REPORTEDLY “yielded up” to a pack of
swimming and yelping coon dogs just for the
sport of it. ’4’». g, .- ”‘3’;

Homo Sapiens

I mentioned this gruesome activity in a
recent column, you might recall.

And you would have thought, judging from
the angry letters I received, that I bad person-
ally organized the “celebration.” One reader
even vowed she would never read this column
again, because "if you had lived in Rome, you
would have written to the pepulace to come
to the circus and see a group of wretched
Christian captives fed to hungry lions."

That, of course, is a lot of p0ppycock!
Hardly deserving of a rebuttal. If I'm THAT
kind of homo sapien, (thinking or wise man),
then Heaven please help me!

The people who allegedly allow that kind
of activity to take place in Saluda are certainly
worse than animals! In fact, no self-respecting
animal would act that way to begin with.

Animals do not kill their own kind, as we
humans do. And animals don’t kill for sport,
as we do.

In fact, man is the only animal that every
other animal is rightfully frightened of and
threatened by; the only animal that is filled
with greed and a lot of glib rationalizations
about why he does such dastardly things.

Polar bears

Dear Sir: Linda, featured in your article,
may be the most studied polar bear in the
world and was, until recently, one of the
most frequently incarcerated. Happily she
and her as yet unnamed cub have found a
permanent home far from the Churchill
bear jail, in Albuquerque’s Rio Grande'
Zoo. With an able parole board consisting
of the Canadian Ambassador to the United
States, the Canadian Wildlife Service, and
a jury of US. Wildlife and Albuquerque

zoo officials and local groups, the bears
, were relocated on April 13.

ADISON, Wis.—It was a nice day for dogs,
monkeys, baboons .'. . and people, and for some
of us, it was a little unreal. Maybe that was
because of the memories. ,

The warm spring sunshine that spilled across. the
University of Wisconsin cam 'us here was like a myste—
rious, silent weapon that ha thousands of students
8 rawled everywhere on the grass. Bascom Hill, where
t e big statue of Abe Lincoln is suplposed to stand up if a
virgin ever Passes by, was like a attlefield where the
casualties 0 good weather and young love were
entwined.

Applying a meta hor of war to the tranquility is valid
only if you remem er some'of the things that went on
here during the protest days of the 1960s. Then clouds of
tear gas rolled up the hill, and the students were on
their feet and filled with anger. Law officers in riot gear
used clubs on long-haired kids, and the country wrung
its hands because it was painful to have “hippies” '
lgiclllting the collective conscience around like a soccer

a . -

As a newspaper reporter, I was on the campus here
for a lot of that. I trailed along behind mobs of young
people and watched them throw bricks through Windows
and start fires in the street. Sometimes in their paranoia
they thought I was an undercover cop, and they would
turn on me like hissing cats. , -

,It was a bad time for everybody, and it, peaked here
one dark mornin when a ton of ex losives blew the side
out of a campus uilding and kille a young researcher.

I HAVE BEEN back to the university many times
since, noting its businesslike, even sleepy nature and
have found it hard to believe that it was once the scene
of such warlike violence.

Then the word went out several days ago that there
was going to be a demonstration and rally on the
campds. It was to be on behalf of the animals, specifi-
cally those animals used in research. A coalition of
animal welfare groups had organized mass meetings
here and in three other US. cities. Madison was chosen
in part because there is a large primate research
faggitff on the UW campus.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE
Bi" April 26, 1983

Stokes

~ “Gunsmoke” fame, read a poem about cruelty to
_ animals, and the crowd gave her a long ovation that far

 

It was the first day of Daylight Saving, Time, and in
some respects it was as if time had stripped its ears
and, instead of jumping ahead one hour, it had sipped
back 15 years. The streets were full of sign-carrying
people who then gathered on the library mall to chant
and cheer and listen to speeches.

There were those physical similarities to the protest
days of the ’605, and there was also a theme common to

‘ that time: a takeover of society’s conscience in order to

shape it up.

But the differences dominated. The people were older
and more diverse. There were gray-haired women and
bald-headed men interspersed among the younger peo-
ple. Signs that they carried showed that the demonstra-
tors had come from all over the Midwest, and there
could be no doubt as to their sincerity. They circulated
literature and stories amon one another that told of
horribly cruel ex riments ing done on monkeys and
other animals. T ey cheered the speakers, who said
something had to be done about these travesties.

THERE SEEMED to be some question about the

appropriateness of their Madison target. Two local

animal welfare groups sat out the Sunday demonstra-
tion, apparently convinced that needless animal cruelty
fﬁis not committed at the primate facility here.

' But several speakers alluded to 'a project at the UW

wildlife ecology department, in whic the wings of 74
ducks were broken in order to study their survivability
in the wild. All but one of them died. Such references
elicited the emotions that tied the group together here:
indignation, even outrage as- well as compassion, decen-
cy and love.

At one point, actress Amanda Blake, the Miss Kitty of

i

surpassed anything she ever iot from the Long Branch-
Saloon customers. She threw isses to the crowd in
return. . I

.Detractors would call the Sunday demonstration here, ‘
a gathering of bleeding hearts who would stiﬂe neces- '

'sary and le itimate animal research. Some of the

speakers ac nowledged as much. Les Zegart, Chicago,
who is the Midwest director of the Fund for Animals,
said that opposition should not deter people from the
“moral obligation to effect a change. ’ . .

Somebody else quoted Gandhi as sayin that a society
is udged on the way it treats its anima s.

young woman with a plaintive voice sang songs -

about animals, and then people passed among the crow
collecting money in coffee cans. '

. I FOUND it difficult to put it all into perspective. On

its face, it was, as one speaker had noted, part of the/
largest movement ever held on behalf of animal welt”
fare, and thus history-making. ' >
Or as one listener said to a friend, “It’s a nice day,
and it’s a good cause. What more cauld you ask?” ,
Maybe I fall somewhere in between those two as-
sessments. I have to think back to the days of mayhem
and Wild-eyed students trashing the campus in collective
temper tantrums. What went on here the other day in

g the April sunshine IS certainly a step up from that.

I guess I would have been more comfortable with it if
the targets had been more clearly defined. I can get 4
much more indignant, about. @9986 of 1% hold, ire in ’
trapping wild animals than I can" about t e use?) ‘ '
animals in medical research.

~.Also, no one in his right mind favors cruelty to
animals, but there were people in their right mind who
favored the Vietnam War.

That must be what bothered me there at the sun-
drenched library mall, the clarity of the moral principle
and the cloudiness of its application. It probab y “r
shouldn’t have because, like the things that occurred
here during the 1960s, this was simply another example
pf dusftitli‘g off the social conscience. Lord knows it needs

The White Paper will form

Parliament and its main pro-
rsions are certain to be incor-
porated in the Conservative
election manifesto.

New system

Although it is likelvto fall
short of the demands of militant
animal rights groups Ministers
hope the z:White Paper will be
able to satisfi moderate opinion
that controls on ammal experi-
mehts are being strengthened to
prevent any unnecessary suffer-
ing.

The main thrust of the White
Paper will be to tighten up on
issuing licences for animal ex-
perimentation. The original Act,

drawn up more than 100 years
ago. was primarily concerned
with vivise—ction. Now many of
the experiments involve subject-
ing animals to stress, or testing
new drugs, cosmetics, pesticides
and industrial substances. ‘

The Government is expected
to outline a new system of
licensing. which will cover not
only individuals carrying out

‘ experiments but all procedures

tories. Before licences

issued, scientists and laboratory ,

staff would have to justify the
need to use animals. and be
subject to striCt conditions on
both the numbers and types of
animals used in any experi-
ments. Embryos will also be
covered.

The White Paper will also
propose controls on the supply
of animals to laboratories.
aimed particularly at fears that
family pets. such as cats and
dogs. are being taken from the
streets by unscrupulous dealers.

Laboratories licensed to carry
out experiments will be
required to purchase animals
from controlled breeding
centres. which will be subject
to Government inspection.

Ministers are also keen to
give more independence to the
present advisory cOmmittee on
animal experiments. This .will
be established on a statutory
basis, so that it can have 1

Some animal use in laboratory research is
needless,“i‘iii'i‘ilitﬁfeess'arily’ repetitive, cruel and
provides no real benefit to anyone. After reading
a copy of transcripts of a series of hearings on
the subject, I was shocked; yes, even sick. Many

of the statements given at this hearing were
given by experts, people with PhDs after their
name.

A rally to protest this type of research is
planned April 24. More than 100 organizations in
11 countries will take part. One such rally will be
held at the California Primate Research Center
in Davis. If you want more information, send me

But there are other, more moderate
activists who seek tighter controls on the
experiments and the amount of pain
forced on the animals.

They question the validity of many
product‘safety tests done with animals and
demand more research to find alterna-
tives. such as tissue cultures or computer
models of biological systems.

Congress is considering a bill that would
tighten controls, although an amendment
that would have provided $30 million to

In California, legislation that would
ave stopped universities such as Stanford
and the University of California from ob-
taining unadopted cats and dogs from

month.

But the fight for the state bill created
lingering bitterness among animal-care of-
ficials at universities.

“When you are launching an emotional
appeal and you're trying for funding and
workers, there can only be two kinds of
pe0ple, the good guys and the bad guys,”
said Dr. Charles Sedgwick, the campus
veterinarian at UC~Davis who oversees the
care of all research animals at Davis.

Many scientists, in fact, bitterly resent
the implication that laboratory animals
are misused.

As funding for the National Institutes of
Health and other agencies expanded, so
did the number of researchers.

On any given day at Stanford, there are
50,000 laboratory animals, mainly rats
and mice, involved in research projects.

UC-Davis has one of the largest labora-
tory animal populatons in the nation:
65,000, including 2,000 primates and a bea-
gle breeding colony.

UC-Berkeley uses 40,000 mice in cancer
and virus research, as well as rats, rabbits,
primates, cats and dogs.

But how many of those animals are
wasted on needless, useless and senseless
experiments, as critics claim?

“Too much researchjsjllihgyght of,
pggrly done and the results are thus very
poor,” conce es ed Buyukmihci, a vetﬁf-
narian and associate professorﬂatNUC;
Davis. "In testing compounds like mascara
and mouthwash, we shd'iild'n’tb'e usinggni-
Inglsso we can go out on the town or smell

“deukmihci, who stressed he was Speak-

ducted only for gaining grants, notoriety
among colleagues or promotions,“

quickly as possible. And scientists involved
should agree with that."

Indeed, some scientists have joined the
outcries.

"There is an institutionalization, al-
ready, of giving animals electric shock,”
said Barbara Orlans, president of the 3-
year-old Scientists Center for Animal Wel~
fare and scientific officer in the Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute of the National
Institutes of Health.

“Psychologists are brought up to believe
this is what should be done,” she said,
adding, “It’s also a product of science
fairs. My main concern for years has been
on the kind of training young people are
getting, which leads to them having a lack
of sensitivity about how much pain is in.

we
a

volved in experiments, fer instance, or

using restraint chairs.”

Finding out what kinds of experiments
are being done and how much pain to the
animals is involved has become a focus of ‘
the animal—rights movement.

Armed with copies of the book “Animal
Liberation,” activists are heeding author
Peter Singer’s advice of scouring obscure
scientific journals to learn what experi-
ments are being done.

Singer, an Australian philosopher,
spurred on the movement in 1973 when
“Animals, Men and Morals,” an article he
wrote for the New York Review of Books,

affected sexual performance and prefer-

Then came a blitz of adverse publicity
and threats by nearly 200 patrons to drop
their memberships. Museum directors
dropped the experiments. '

’_ because in tests involving low~toxicity sub-

' ' cal have to be force-fed to the animals that

In a speech at the World Environment
Center in New York last year, Joshua
Lederberg, a Nobel Prize-winning geneti-
cist and president of Rockefeller Universi»
ty, called for a reassessment of toxicity
testing.

“First of all, understand that the one- or
two- or three-hundred millions of dollars a
year that we're now spending on routine
animal tests are almost all worthless from
the point of view of standard-setting. It
may beappropriate for setting alarms.

“It is simply not possible with all the
animals in the world to go through new
chemicals in the blind way that we have at
the present time and reach credible solu-

‘3 tions about the hazards to human health.”

The more animal species in which you . .1
perform tests, the more you get a picture
as to what the range of possibilities is.”

This year alone. more than 65 million
lab animals will be used in the United
States in thousands of experiments. Tax-
payers finance nearly $4 billion of them.

Government research money is distrib-
uted primarily through the National Insti-
tutes of Health. the National Science Foun-
dation, the Defense Department, the De-
'artment of Energy. the Environmental

rotection Agency and the Food and Drug
Administration. ' _

Routinely. laboratory animals are in- "
jected with poisonous substances, adminis- _
tered electric shocks, artificially stressed, :“
burned, injured and infected with disease.

To study human addictions, monkeys
are forced into daily marijuana and co- - 9
caine habits. Beagles have to smoke the
equivalent of thousands of cigarettes. Cats . .
and dogs have gallons of alcohol poured
into them. -' "

‘ grooming in mice with amputated fore-
limbs at the University of Oregon.
Conducted in 1973, the researcher cut
one limb off 12 mice and both forelimbs

off another 12 mice. After filming the .

results for five months, the scientist con-

cluded that grooming was under genetic -

control and not dependent on such external
factors as the mice being able to touch
their paws to their faces.

Two groups of hamsters were used, with

that blinded hamsters were as likely to
attack as sighted ones.

“There is no shortage of money, only a
shortage of good fundraising: Creative
$trategies for Non-Profits”

Certified Fundraising Executive, Robert Getz
has shared a wealth of practical ideas and advice
with non—profits all across the US. about how to
successfully raise funds. Dollars seem to be shrink-
ing and the competition for funding is becoming
more and more intense. This workshop will offer
an in-depth look at “planned” giving programs,
as well as other types of fundraising that humane
societies have traditionally not utilized. He will

teach you how to move away from bake sales and
flea markets and into types of giving that will pro—
vide you with a real economic base from which
you can accomplish more for animals. Mr. Getz
is known for his easy—to—-understand delivery,
and is frequently described as a natural born
teacher with an obvious love for helping people.

1:30 p.m. - 2:45 p.m.

‘What Do You Do With Your Surplus Pets?”

David K. Wills, Executive Director of the Mich-
igan Humane Society, will conduct this Work—
shop on the various practical and ethical
considerations that humane societies and others
must grapple with when dealing with our state’s
(and nation’s) pet overpopulation problem. Top-
ics to be discussed will include, among other
things, concerns such as: the direct relationship
between a shelter’s community image and its
ability to increase the number of lost pets re-
turned to their owners and the number of pets
adOpted into new homes; the negative effect of
pound seizure on a shelter’s image; how pound
seizure undermines effective animal control and
redemption and adoption rates; how pound sei-
zure and animal cruelty are symptoms of the pet
overpopulation “disease”; how to respond to the
public or special interest groups who react
negatively to the fact that shelters have to euth—
anize so many animals; the pros and cons of as—
sorted methods of euthanasia, including the
showing of an MHS Training Film on “How to
Euthanize with Sodium Pentobarbitol”. There
will also be a brief commentary by the current
manager of the lngham County Humane Soci—
ety which started euthanizing with Sodium
Pentobarbitol just this year, so smaller societies
can learn how easy it is to obtain and use it. The
relationship between the humane movement
and “organized” veterinary medicine, especially
relative to low-cost spay/neuter and veterinary
medical programs will also be discussed.

2:45 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.

Break

and/or projects on behalf of animals and their
rights that can be performed by humane—minded
individuals right in their homes. Mr. Gorney has
spent 17 years actively involved in the fight for
animal rights. He is very well acquainted with all
major animal welfare and rights advocacy organ—
izations. He is a contributing writer for
AGENDA, the Newsmagazine of the Animal
Rights Network, and has assisted F.A.C.T.
(Food Animal Concerns Trust). He was also
instrumental in winning the passage of a Bowling
Green, Ohio city ordinance which banned the
keeping of exotic pets in that city. In addition to

Introduction of Dr. Donald Barnes by MFHS Of-
ficer Eileen Liska.

“Conditioned Ethical Blindness”: The Use

Washington, DC. Office of the National Anti—
Vivisection Society will explain why he gave up
his position as a researcher for the US. Military
after 16 years of working with animals, particu—
larly with primates. Dr. Barnes is unquestionably
one of the US. humane movement’s most artic—
ulate and successful advocates of research ani—
mal rights. He travels all across our nation edu-
cating people about the abuse and unnecessary
use of live animals in various types of publicly—
and Privately-supported experimental research,
testing, and teaching. His comments are widely
reported in the news media, and just in the past
few months, his wisdom graced the pages of
NEWSWEEK, and the airwaves of programs like
Freeman Reports on Cable News Network,
and Frontline, a Public Broadcasting Corpora-
tion newsmagazine, among others. Michigan
humanitarians are fortunate to have Dr. Barnes
take the time out of his demanding schedule of
public appearances to share his knowledge with
us as we all embark upon our anti-pound seizure
campaign in Michigan.

exploitation that are occuring in today’s world. A

SPCA gives
kids a lesson
in pet care

 

A sad story, a look ’round the parish Shel-I
ter, and a talk about animal overpopula-
tion make these children more responsible.

 

 

By LILY JACKSON
Siaf/ writer
4'

 

here was Bull, an ancient

yellow and white hulk of

a dog, sprawled amiably,

allowing 14 little hands
to rub his stubby hair in 14 dif»
ferent directidns.

A curly-haired little girl was
cuddling a honey-colored spotted
puppy with vague cocker spaniel
aspirations .. who minded not
at all being carted around upside
down.

Attracting a devoted following
was a strangely shaped black and
white dog who has a body like a
sausage, a snout like an anteater
and a tail that could sweep the
ﬂoor.

‘You got a iguana here?” a
trendy young man wanted to
know. (They didn’t.)

It was a sunny morning at the
Jefferson SPCA, a compact cin—
der-block building on North
Meadow in M'etairie.

» Star boarders such as Bull were
playing hosts to children from
third grade and special educatiOn
classes at Harahan Elementary
School.

The children were courteous
and understanding guests -- and
well they should be —- as earlier
they attended a humane. educa-
tion program at their school, con- '
ducted by Nita Hemeter, educa-

tion director for the Jefferson

SPCA.

Hemeter, who has more spirit
than a cheerleader, had whipped
her audience into an enthusiastic
interest with a question: “What
does S. P. C. A stand for?”

They ﬁgure that it has some-
thing to do with pets, an answer
that 13 close enough for Hemeter.

Now, she wanted to know,
“What does R. P 0. stand for,”
poser she hastened to answer
herself: “That stands for respon-
sible pet owner.

And, she added “that is what
we want to be.’

Now the children have been
properly primed for the piece de
resistance, a movie called: “A
Home is Belonging to Some—
body.”

The story is about Misty “just
an ordinary dog” who became the
boon companion of a little boy
named Mike.

Life was serene for Mike and.
Misty until (and here the music 2

Swells ominously}. Mike’s father
is transferred to arsﬁther city and
there will be no room in their
apartment for Misty.

Thinking (mistakenly) that if
theytook Misty to a park some--
one would surely take her home,
Mike and his parents dropped
the. dog off and drove away.

Poor Misty. Bewildered and
sad, she looks in vain for some—
one or something familiar, but
alas -——~ nothing

Misty is terribly lonely She
eventually makes her way back
to her old home, only to wait for—
lornly on. the porch.

She’s hungry and is soon
.scrounging for food in garbage
cans. Misty has become a tramp.

The children are quiet,
enthralled, as the drama con-2
tinues. 2

Stumbling through the brush,

“ Misty cuts her paw on a piece of 2

glass. She licks her wound, then
curls up "in a ball, as it is begin-

ning to turn cold.

On the nearby highway, a car
has stopped. Misty hears voices
and heads toward them.

A little girl begs her parents:

“Oh, can’t we take the dog with

’9

us.

They are unable to keep her,
but this family does take Misty
to the animal shelter, where she
is bathed, groomed, fed and her
wounded paw tended.

Before too long, along comes a ,

little red~haired boy with freckles
who spies Misty, and it’s immedi-
ate love.

Misty has found a home.

Then Hemeter returns to add
a postscript. “The one thing
every dog has to have is someone
to love.’

Now, she trots out her visual
aids to emphasize the important
lessons 1n prOper pet care.

She displays Patches, a dog
cutout attached on a felt board,
and then asks, “What does
Patches need.”

Raising hands politely, the
children right away come up ith
food and water, so Hemeter
places these items on the board.

“Now, what else does Patches
need,” she asks, as she rummages
in a case to come up with a:
“Leash —- this is important.
There are only three places where
your dog is safe: in the house, in

a fenced—in yard and on a leash.”‘
And what is the leash hOled

to: “That’s right, a collar, but be.

sure the collar has an identiﬁca-

‘tion tag.”

“Do you all take a bath, do you
go to the doctor, get shots”
these questions bring forth
impressivly vocal yesses ..__ “Well
your dogs and cats need these
things too.

It’s nhw time for the humane
society’s most urgent point to be
made: “There’s We most impor-
tant things your dog and cat
needs. It begins with an S”

Since the childre . seemed to
be momentarily stumped on this,
Hemeter doesn’t waste another

minute:
“Spaying- There are. too many

dogs and cats and not enough.
homes.”

Animal groups that deserve support

HIL RAY OF PALO ALTO wrote in some time ago requesting
P that I profile various animal- protection organizations He asked,
7 . “In one of your future columns you might discuss some of the~
animal protection groups. .’_Im sure it would be helpful to us who
can’t activate the movement in any other way financially.

Ray’s request was immediately filed away in my expansive “ideas ,
i‘ for future columns” stack. His suggestion is a good one, although I
Withink all of us can always do more than simply donate money -

writing letters being one of the most effective tools in helping ani«
mills.

LISTED BELOW ARE a few local and national groups that I think
are the best.I should mention that there are many more excellent
_ organizations aside from those I’m listing. This, however is all room

allOws fur. My apologies to those I have excluded. 1

, . HUMANE SOCIETY OF THE UNITED STATES (HSUS): This is
certainly the largest/nationa1 animal protection organization, with ‘

membership exceeding several hundred thousand HSUS is a mod-

, 57erate organization that monitors a variety of animal welfare issues It

.. also works clOsely with animal shelters. HSUS’ 3 regional office is

1713 J St., Suite 211, facramento 95814. The telephone is (916)

447 3295.

7 ACTION FOR ANIMALS (AFA): This is a small, local grass- -roo_ts
Organization that involves itself with a variety of animal rights issues.
It publishes a calendar of events. For $6 a year you can get on AFA’s
:, mailing list. Contact Eric Mills, Action for Animals, P. O. Box 20184,
. Oakland 94620. The telephone number is (415) 652— 5603.

HUMANE FARMING ASSOCIATION (HFA): This organization
has the help of public health specialists, veterinarians, humane orga
nlzatlons and consumer advocates HFA members are united in a
campaign to eliminate the severe and senseless suffering most farm
animals are subjected to, and to protect consumers from the danger-
Ous misuse of chemicals in food productions HFA,1550,Califor-
111a St., Suite 118, San Francisco 94109, (415) 485- 1495.

Ms. Morene Mullen

Woodside, California 94062

Dear Ms. Mullen,

Thank you for your message regarding the Reagan Administration's
budget proposal to discontinue funding for enforcement of the
Animal Welfare Act. I share your concern about the consequences.

I was the Senate sponsor of the Animal Welfare Act when it was
enacted in 1970. I well recognize its importance in establishing
needed safeguards for animals. The measure strengthened federal
laws regulating the transportation, sale, and handling of animals
used for research, or exhibition or to be sold as pets. It has .
also provided a significant foundation for subsequent laws governing
the humane treatment of animals and has been helpful in focu51ng
national attention on the issue of animal research. The law has
worked.

While I strongly support efforts to reduce the federal deficit,“
we need not eliminate the principal tool we have to ensure quality
care for animals. I will do all I can to see that this funding

is maintained.

As I have throughout my 16 years in the Senate, I will support
legislation and work actively to see that animals are treated
humanely and with dignity. It's good to hear from so many
Californians who, like you, care about protecting animals and
promoting animal welfare. It will take all of us working together
to see that animals receive the humane treatment which should be

their entitlement.
:nceEZly, ;

Alan Cranston

Dear Friend:

I want to take this opportunity to let you know that I have
recently introduced the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals
Act in the Senate.

Senate Bill 1233, the Improved Standards for Laboratory
Animals Act, was introduced on Tuesday, June 4, and referred to
the Senate Agriculture Committee. Enclosed is a reprint from the
Congressional Record with my opening remarks and a summary and
text of the legislation.

I might also note that Congressman George Brown, of
California, introduced a similar measure, S. 2653, in the House
on the same day. I am hopeful that both the House and the Senate
will take swift action on these bills to help lessen unnecessary
pain and suffering of research animals and promote the use of
alternative methods in research. Your continuing interest in the
welfare of animals, both in research and other areas in need of
our attention, is encouraging. I look forward to discussing the
merits of this legislation with my colleagues, members of the
research community, and those who share my View that existing
standards for the use and care of research animals are in need of
improvement and careful oversight.

Thank you for your interest and concern.

Si cerelw yours,

Cuba Today— A Preview

" Millions of animals and plants, which
have evolved with us and around us, are

vanishing under our hands before they -

have even been named or studied by us.

. 1.7 million species of animals and about
300,000 plants have been classified up to
now, but between 3 and 8 million animals,
and unknown million plant species remain
unidentified. Some scientists estimate
that we know only ten percent of our
fellow travelers on the spaceship earth. At
the same time, in 1985, the extinction rate
has reached one species a day. During the
’905, one kind of plant or animal will disap—
pear forever every hour, and by the year
2000, we will lose 130 species a day. In
that year, a mere 15 years away, one
million species could be extinct, vanished
like the flightless dodo bird of Mauritius
which was killed by humans about three
centuries ago.

Worldwide, 25,000 known plant spe—
cies are endangered. In the United States,
as all over the world, one in ten plants is
threatened. Similarly, 10 percent of all
birds and all mammals are close to extinc—
tion. No one can guess at‘the number of
threatened fishes, reptiles, amphibians
and insects. All that is known is the fact
that each plant that disappears drags
down about 20 to 40 animal species
dependent on it.

.About 90 percent of all species that ever
lived on the earth are now extinct, but up
until about 10,000 years ago man was
innocent, as yet unable to push another
species over the edge. Successive waves
of migrating hunters changed that about
that time when they migrated across the
Bering Strait into the North American ”con—
tinent. They are thought to have hunted

the woolly mammoth, themastodon, the

 

 

 

Recently, I had the opportunity to T

escape the damp spring weather by doing
something many wish they could do, tak—
ing a trip to the Caribbean. My trip was a
little different in that l Spent two weeks
learning and working In Cuba.

The Venceremos Brigade has organized
trips to-Cuba every year since 1970, with
our brigade being the sixteenth. As well as

picking citrus fruit, and this year, picking

It is difficult to go to Cuba for most
Americans, as Ronald Reagan ruled,

going to Cuba or while they are there.
Therefore, we can only go legally as guests

Pleistocene horse and camel until they
disappeared forever.

The extinction rate remained very low
for a Very long time, though. And only a
short time ago, scientists estimated the
rate of disappearance of animal species at
about one a year. At that time only mam-
mals and birds, of which about 13,000
species are known today, were counted.
The many other life forms, plants or

animals, which probably caused the
.“higher” forms downfall, went largely
unnoﬁced.

Overhunting was, until recently, the way
most species of animals were eradicated.
From the European lion, which went
around the year 80, to the buffalo herds of
the American west to the anchoveta
swarms and the seabirds dependent on
them off the coast of Peru, it was beings in '
search of food, furs, or fun who killed
many species. But the rate of extinction
accelerated dramatically over the past 85
years. Of all the animals that have disap-
peared in the last 2,000 years, more than
half were-still around in 1900. Hunters'still
threaten. mammals, birds, reptiles and

    

It is curious thatin our society, which
prides itself on civil rights freedoms, that
Americans are effectively prohibited from
visiting a country only ninety miles to the
south of us. As the folksinger Phil Ochs
wrote, ”In the free world you live, and in
the free world you must stay." _,.,

I wanted to go to Cuba because I had
heard that they were tackling difficult
social problems like racism and sexism.
My interest expanded to the point where I
wondered how a socialist society would
operate to fill the needs of its people.
What'l found was a people that met
challenges he'ad on—the important
challenges of feeding, clothing, and pro-
viding work for all.

I will be working to de—mystify Cuban
life and am glad to share my observations.

fishes today in their'search for profit. We
are, all of us, more or less - directly
responsible—even as vegetarians we
endanger some species, with irresponsible
zoo suppliers, collectors of unirsual
houseplants or medical researchers in
need of human—like creatures for their
experiments aCting as our agents.

Worse still are the unintentional, "that' 5
too bad” losses of life forms through pes-
ticides, herbicides, or pollution. Chemical
clubs raised against various pests come
down equally devastatingly on numerous
other plants and creatures. When crops
or even woodlands are in danger, it is
sometimes hard to find an alternative to
strong poisons—but are sterile, carpet-like
lawns unblemished by dandelions or
clover blossoms really worth endangering
the environment? And do we. really
believe our own health will remain unaf-
fected when polluted air and water turn
animal cradles in swamps and, streams,
lakes and rivers, in coastal marshes and in
the very sea into animal cemeteries?

rainforests of Africa, more than 200 new
plants a year are discovered. Recently two
US. scientists who studied the plants used
by the Amazonian tribes came back with

80,000 edible plants, only 150 have ever
been widely cultivated.’Today, 20 food
plants provide 90 percent of all the foods
we eat, with 75 percent coming from Only
eight food plants. Moreover, most of the
20 plants are cultivated in a very few selec-
ted and overbred strains; half of the wheat
grown in all of Canada comes ‘from one,

considerations, by citing material losses to
humankind through the eventual loss of
the vast resource pool, or library, con-
tained in tropical and other forests. And
the .. arguments are indeed impressive.
About 50 percent of all prescription drugs

scarce—either because the vines have
been overcollected or because the

toWard extinction. . . .

_ 'Let’s look into 'our own backyards,
where all around the metropolitan region
small forest enclaves are being bulldozed.
‘We can only gueSs how many birds and
insects, flowers and shrubs,’mammals and
reptiles will lose their shelter and their
food ‘ supplies. Two examples of the
foreseeable Consequential damage of this
”mindless drive towards development at

any price suffice for many: As' recent

studies of Hyde Park in, London have

“Sound barriers.” ,

blooms in abUndance. North American

. indians used mayapple to treat deafness

and warts and to kill parasitic worms.
Today, mayapple looks very promising as a
treatment for testicular cancer, various

forms of Herpes and influenza, measles,
and also as a non-toxic repellant against

the yellow and black potato beetles.

But the most convincing utilitarian argu-
ment for conservation comes with a- look
at the wild relatives of domesticated

time. As long as many wild or semi—
domesticated varieties of our food crops
exist, science can reach back into this
genetic library to come up with new, bet-
ter adapted strains. But many of these
reserves are becoming extinct, and who
can fault the farmers all over the world
who must. increase their yield by using the
more “modern" varieties of rice and
wheat, corn, millet and soybeans or
pOtatoes. The same, impoverishment in
variety is true for-farm animals. About 118
cattle breeds are disappearing from the
Mediterranean region where farmers turn
to about 30 “standard” breeds.

Another important point conser-
vationists have only discovered a short
while ago: EaChcplant._sp.ectesday/9.0-1919

clear is that all life is interdependent, prob-
ably in more ways than we have learned so
far. Plants not only supply fodder for plant
eaters, they help to maintain the right mix
of gases in the earth’s atmosphere. Bac-
teria and microorganisms in the soil keep
the cycle of life going. Whoever cuts
blindly into that life cycle might well end
up with injuries, or bring about the end
not only of something as seemingly unim-
portant as a snail darter, but the end of
us all.

Philosophers and conservationists
around the world have, in the last years,
more and more stopped using economic

arguments for conservation and have.

and equally easy to overlook starving
humans near those forests. We cannot
expect them to go on being hungry, have a
high infant mortality and a short life expec-
tancy while we worry about wildlife rather
than about their lives. Their governments
are under pressure, as we should be, to do
first things first in order to feed mal-
nourished populations. If we want the
age-old tradition of slashing and burning
forests to make way for food-producing
farms to stop in the near future, we have to
help. We have to do our fair share in the
economic development of the tropics.
Since conserVation conscious long-term
solutions are more expensive than stop
gap measures, we should contribute. It
will take careful planning, time and effort.
Despite the eConomic pressure, many
tropical countries are making great efforts
at conservation. Many African, Asian, and
Latin American countries maintain nature
reserves and parks, some of which are
established with help from the United

organizations. Somehcguntries-are.follow-

variety of nutritious foods, household products, health and bodycare items,
vitamins, and natural fiber clothing. We are committed to raising the nutri-
tional awareness of our community, and we carry an extensive stock of cook-
books and books on nutrition and the politics of food to that end. We are a

Reforms Needed? '

Animal Shelter

Amarillo city ofﬁcials should give quick and seri-
ous consideration to a local veterinarian’ s offer to
help improve animal control services.

Dr. Fred Love recently told city ofﬁcials that the
"animal shelter has three major shortcomings: i n-
jured strays are not treated, animals are adopted
without shots, and the decompression chamber is a
Controversial way of putting unwanted animals to
death. ,

Of the three issues raised by Love, the latter is the
most important. The chamber, which brings death by
suffocation, has been under attack recently by
groups that say it is painful and inhumane. These
groups want lethal injections used instead of the
chamber.

Love proposes that veterinarians and their
students vaccinate strays on arrival, care for injured
animals, perform spay and neuter operations, and
administer death by lethal injections when that is _
necessary.

The Animal Control Board promised to consider
the proposal after Love and Humane Society Presi-
dent Sally Bivins submit an ofﬁcial proposal. The
Humane Society would help by raising funds to de-
fray some of the additional expenses.

We can only hope the matter is pursued in earnest.

It is an unfortunate reality that some unwanted an-
imals must be put to death. On those occasions, death
should be as painless as possible. We are not pre-
pared to debate whether the decompression chamber
is inhumane; not even the experts seem to agree on
that. But we would feel much better if a method gen-
erally thought to be painless were used instead. We
think most Amarilloans agree.

It 13 also obvious that fewer animals would have to
be put to death if fewer were born. That’s why Love
and Bivins are on target when they talk about the
need for spaying and neutering. .

And it goes without saying that any injured animal
should be treated immediately.

Of course, we realize that the total cost must be
considered before any project is undertaken. So ﬁnal
judgment must be reserved until some concrete ﬁg-
ures are presented.

But we think most Amarilloans will agree that the,
ﬁgures should be studied and acted upon quickly;
more humane treatment of helpless animals should
not be postponed any longer than absolutely neces-
sary.

, The problem with passing humane legislation is.
that the general public is usually unaware of the

abuses. When people become aware of animal cruel- ‘

ty, there is always a public outcry. But often those
instances that are reported are isolated, albeit sensa-
tional, cases involving the mistreatment of domestic
animals by individuals. The greatest amount of anti-

mal cruelty, however, is institutionalized and out or
public view. It is perpetrated by businesses, corporate".

«tions and 01‘ Sanizations .WhiCh have a vested intemsr
in the exploitation of animals, ‘ ~ . - » ~ ~

’3

There are two bills . before Congress Which, it”:
1 , would eliminate a great deal of animal. mis-
:er‘y.?0ne ($2389/ HR1797) proposes to'outlaw steel-jaw ‘-

leghold traps used for catching fur-bearing animals
or predators. Animals . caught in these barbaric de-

vices suffer broken bones and torn ﬂesh. Many die '1
from shock, starvation and attacks from predators-
before the trapper returns. Non-target species (in-

cluding pets) are often caught. Such animals maybe

set tree, but becauSe of the loss of limbs from the?

wounds, theyusually do not survive. _

The proposed 1egislation--—~ similar to laws in over
60 foreign countries and several of ourjown states -—~
.would permit animals to be caught in less painful and-

   

damazins trails, axis would not materially alter trap—
ping“ " ” 4 ' ces. luteven though: it loaf" relatively mild
bill, it has been strongly opposed by trapping organi~

nations, themr mushy manicure, manufacw’

ers’ofthe traps. ,»

Another important and much needed piege we“

lation would eliminate some of the suffering experi-
enced by laboratory animals. -

' Many of the experiments inﬂict Severe pain or
pSYchological distress on the animal victims with
little. prospect of significant benefits for humanity.

-Much of the research is done without the use ofpain-‘
' killers or anesthetics. Instead of anesthesia, animals

are sometimes 31%;! paralyzmz drugs-Which allow
them to reel palmbut which. prevent themlrom mov-

ignore the animal’s agony- Most states (including

*_. Texas) exempt researchers from anti-cruelty laws,
andani‘mals maybe legally burned, frozen, blinded,“

‘ ed, drugged, isolated, poiSOned or starved.

The bill now pending in Congress .(~5657/HR5725)
would. not in any way end the use of animals in

 

 

 

ime isshOrt ‘

scientific experiments, but would prevent needless
suffering. it would require the use of pain-relieving

drugs whenever possible, provide euthanasia when

needed. and prohibit the repeated use of the same

’ animal in different experiments. It weald require ex-

perimenters to certify that they had; considered other

methods of research before settling on the testing of

live animals, and every institution using laboratory

animals-wmldhave to appoint a committeeto review

all experiments Protection would be given to em»
ployees‘ who report violations, of humane regulations.
It would also estabish an information service for re
searchers to avoid unintended duplication of experi—
ments which could save nullionsofiederal dollars.
The research community repeatedly claims that
laboratory. animals are given humane treatment, but
at the same time they lobby against legislation that
would ensure such care. Despite the assurances,
those who have inspected laboratories state that

, there is a great deal of pointless; suffering in experi- .,

merits... Although abuses are generally kept secret,

there are a number of well~documented examples of

outrageous cruelty,

A newspaper reporter visiting: the hospital labora—
tory at the University of Florida recently discovered
a dog with an incision open and/its entrails exposed.
A more! California humane... Societies have filed suit
against Stanford University and. Palo. Alto Veteram
Administration Hospital for mistreatment of a lab
dog who was found collapsed in the doorway of their
research laboratory by a medical student. The dog
was Ishakmgi and coughing, and, had deep infected .
wounds ongall legs. Bone was exposed on one leg, and
stitches had split open on a surgical incision in the
groin. Thel’doig: was taken by the student to an emer-
gency. elude. where a veterinarian euthanized it. An
autopsy reueaIed that the. animal was suffering from
advanced pneumonia and dehydration, and the intesg
tinal tract wasempty. '

Time is running out in this session for the passage.
of laws to pretect animals. It seems that money,
instead of ethics or lo ic, sets the legislative pace,
and there are many . special interest groups who
profit from the misuse of animals.

Ms. Kimberly Bartlett
1515 Sandy Springs No. 901
Houston, Texas 77042

Dear Ms. Bartlett:

Thank you for your recent letter concerning animal experi—
mentation and leghold traps. We are not able to reprint Monitor
editorials verbatim, and in addition all editorials ~~ which
appear in the upper left~hand corner of page IB —— are written
by our staff as a matter of policy.

We are not as familiar as we would like to be with the
legislation in question, nor do we have time to research it, as
we are very short—staffed right now,

However, we do solicit commentary from members of the public
and upon acceptance they appear on page BB. Since you have written
us a thoughtful and articulate letter on the topic, may we invite
you to submit something yourself? It could be in the form of One
article or two, since there are two topics. Either way, we do have
to insist on a maximum length of three pages double-spaced (less
if possible) due to space limitations.

Please let me know if you are interested in undertaking this ~—
either by letter or by phone at 840~5715 after 11 a.m. weekdays.

Sincerely,

ﬂ

Animal Welfare Institute Information Rep

Washington, DC 20007

Dear Madam or Sir:

Let me introduce myself. I'm a Des Moines-based freelance writer now
working on an assigment for Hearst Publications, publisher of such
magazines as "Good Housekeeping." Hearst is starting up a new general
interest magazine--as yet untitled-~about family life and home, and
all that go with them—~including hobbies and interests, finances, home
and time management, and special interests. For one of the articles—-
"Across America"--in the magazine's premier issue, Hearst editor Ann
Levine (212-262-5700) has asked me to compile a list and description
of newsletters that families would find useful and informative. I
would like to consider including your newletter in the article.

For consideration, however, I must ask you for a quick response.
Please complete the enclosed newsletter questionnaire and send it,
along with at least one sample newsletter, to me by Friday, November
15. I realize by the time you receive this letter you will have only a
couple of days to reply. But if you examine the questionnaire you'll
find that it requires little time to complete and will ensure that all
published information is accurate.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to receive your
material very soon.

Again, thanks. I am

Sincerly yours,

‘ David Walsh

Behind the Mastery

EB. White: The Elegant, Unmistakable Voice of the Essayist _

 

By Henry Mitchell

Washington Post Staff Writer

EB. White, who died yesterday
at 86, t’bok pains not to be grand
and all for naught; he wound up
grand for all his avoidances of gran-
deur, and the more he avoided no-
ble and elevated style the more con—
vinced his readers were that he was
noble—a word not always trotted
out for writers of short and casual
pieces.

He joined The New Yorker in
1926 (it was founded in 1925) and
his work was often unsigned, as in
his “Talk of the Town” sketches.
His work was better than that of
most others at the magazine, and
readers soon started pawing
through the pages for traces of EB.
White and were commonly re-
warded. ‘

But he did not assume superstar
status and while there was, of
course, a slight letdOWn when one

He has been called the best
American essayist of the century,
though mostof his readers possibly
have wondered who the competi-

His work was civil and polite; be

He gave the impression of get-

remember the hour- of a meeting
and the need to pick up dog food

, before the store closed, but then

retiring for a time to think what the
hell is this all about.

He achieved answers, and one of
them was not to get carried away

ing) in the first place without think-
ing it over a spell.

 

The trouble with many potential- 2
ly nice writers is that once they '
think about things they either con- ..

clude (often correctly, no doubt)
they have nothing to say and there-,
fore write nothing, or they bull it

dazzlement of the easily dazzled,
but not to the sustenance or delight
Of the civilized.

Nobody who only met and talked

‘ with White through a long and gold-

en day at his house in Maine has-

‘ any real idea of his life, however

gratifying to see the deep courtesy
and affection shown his wife of

many years and his near-adoration
of a rather grim and almost certain-

"3““:‘able' dog suggests depths of com-
mitment worth remarking.

White was a lyrical man in the

‘ sense that if wonder is lacking it is

impossible to write at all, but be—

cause he was polite and therefore

ecause he de-
scended from respectable people
who had an iron vase on the lawn

and doubtless thought well of Em-

the Way through and not to paint
""“things sweeter than those things

are, and second, because he had

, sufficient technical 1 competence to
“notiCe that rhapsodies defeat the

lofty effect aimed at.

He was not sentimental, or his
work was not. He liked taking care
'of sheep partly because he simply
loved animals, partly because he
loved the bondage animals incur—,—

er or did the hard work of a farmer,
but he took extraordinary care to
keep in touch with the cycling of the
sun and the reality of growth and
death.

Things must have welled up in
him not just sometimes but most of
thetime. He had a powerful sense
of life’s sweetness and took the risk
(a risk for a writer) of letting it
show. He liked to set the stage by
Opening one of his pieces in a mat—
terfofsfact way, forecasting in only
the most tenuous way 2 how the

piece would end:

“To perceive Christmas through
its wrapping becomes more difficult

- with every year.”

He speaks of those ear trumpets
hunters can buy to hear the other:
wise inaudible and distant music of
the hounds, and says something of
the kind would help us hear Christ-
mas. But, alarmed this might seem
a little too sweet, he follows it:

“We rode down on an escalator
the other morning . . .” just to show
you he does not avoid Commonplace
things or ugly words like escalators.
Then he dares an emotional charge
again, but damps it down at once,
but goes on to prepare for the cli-
max by orderly reasoning and useful
but not blinding images. He remains
conversational, casual, letting the
effect of brooding build up very
gradually, alluding to rabbit tracks,
rocket travel, packages of energy
and so on, to show you this is only

ordinary thought and ordinary stuff.-

Then the thing he has with difficul—
ty been holding back and is now
ready to let ﬂy:

“This week many will be re-

_ minded that no explosion of atoms

generates so hopeful a light as the
reﬂection of a star seen apprecia-
tively in a pasture pond. It is there
we perceive Christmas—and the
sheep quiet and the world waiting.”

Intellectually it may make no

. great senSe; Christmas is not per-
2 ceived by anything in any pond, but

what he really. wants, to get to is

“and the Sheep quiet and the “world -

waiting,” and by the time he gets

whose throats have not got tense.

out on the street and something
magical happens; he sees trees on
the street and focuses on the sec-
ond one from the corner. White ‘
wants to say what the Damascus
Road is like, and how the soul can
leap from a dingy cave to the high
clear ether in a bound, but he will'
show it, not talk about it. He will
show it funny, pathetic, stupid—he
will sketch us as we are most of the
time. He will also show the tran-
scendent minute in which the wimp
looks at the. ordinary tree of a city
street, and after the nonsense of his
psychiatric“ session and its attendant
confusion and garble about what he
really wants, he looks at the tree:

“I want the second tree from the
corner, just as it stands, ” he said,
answering an imaginary question
from an imaginary physician. And
he felt a slow pride in realizing that
what he wanted none could bestow, = '
and that what he had, none could ‘
take away. He felt content to be sick,
unembarrassed at being afraid; and
in the jungle of his fear he glimpsed
(as he had so often glimpsed them
before) the ﬂashy tail feathers of the
bird courage. ”

Then he winds up with a para—
graph of funny letdown. Only not
before attempting and achieving in
a mere handful of paragraphs a.
stunning salute to the soul of man in
a way‘ that makes nobody wince at
the gush, and in a way that makes
anybody proud to be a poor bifur-
cated simian and immortal diamond.

Never mind the “classic” chil-
dren’s books so lavishly praised,
and rightly praised. Turn to “The
Second Tree From the Corner,” a
good start and a good finish to the
manor to any man.

Virgil reported on the kingdom of
the dead and Socrates, too modest
to claim any knowledge of, it, yet ‘7
looked forward to speaking there
with the'heroes, arguing the sweet

‘day long. They wrestle (Virgil as-

sures us) on the yellow sands in
sport. And there are the sons of
Teucros, they are not without beau-
ty. 2.
White’s sad and grateful readers
may in their own vision see that
wrestling on that yellow sand today.
Dear Lord, if it isn ’t E. B. White and f
his dachshund. Fred, the One so in-
terested in the farm pigs, the one so
full of mischief (White used to go

‘ visit his grave) and with whom

White could not romp fer. all these
recent years. Leok at them going at '
it. They are not without beauty

Mrs. Christine Stevens

P.0. Box 3650
Washington, D.C. 20007

Dear Christine:

It was very nice of you to write to me about my article on Jungle
World. I'm pleased that you liked it.

I'd be more than happy to research and write about the dis~
appearing rain forests, if I could think of a market. The more
serious magazines such as National GeOgraphic have already pub~
lished articles on this subject, and many magazines, such as
Smithsonian, would want a scientist for the writer. unfortunately,
a totally self~employed free~lancer can't just write an article
and then try to sell it -- we could never afford to work that way.
We propose an article to a Specific magazine, aimed at its parti—
cular readership, and then, if we get the assignment, we write the
article.

My contribution to animal rights and animal welfare lies in
my sometimes ability to reach a mass-readership audience with an
animal subject they might not come across ordinarily. For instance,
this article (enclosed) in Family Circle this month (regional
editions) —- Family Circle has over 16 million readers, most of
whom don't even know that anti—cruelty laws exist. My hope is that
getting this information to this audience will ultimately help
animals.

As you know, I also write bodks, most of them children's books.
I asked my publisher to send you a c0py of my latest, All Wild
Creatures Welcome, and hOpe they complied. It's the story of a wild-
life rehabilitation center, and is full of anti-hunting and trapping
information, including a lot on the leghold trap. The book is a
Junior Literary Guild selection, which means it will reach a fairly
wide audience.

I hope to meet you someday, though I feel as if I already

u. .

A DOG NAMED JAKE:
A STORY OF CRUELTY AND COMPASSION

BY PATRICIA CURTIS

Jake, as the Humane Society found him.

mily was at a party when she saw

the dog. Some of the guests, laugh-

ing and joking, showed her the an-

imal lying in the basement. All
night she lay awake thinking about him,
and when morning came, she picked up
the telephone. “I want to report a case of
cruelty,” said Emily to Cynthia Fields of the
Michigan Humane Society in Detroit. With-
in an hour, a van pulled up in front of the
address. Three staff members got out: Roy
Warner, the cruelty investigator; Dr.
William Nemeth, veterinarian; and David
Wills, executive director.

At first the people in the house denied
knowing about a dog, but finally one man
said, yes, there was one in the basement—
but its owner wasn’t home. Nevertheless,
they let the three men in.

“The basement was dim and dirty,” Wills
relates. “We noticed a bathroom, and look—
ed in. I saw blood on the walls and floor,
and a large pair of bloody shears in the
sink. Suddenly a little head rose in the
gloom and a pair of eyes looked up at us.
A thin, half-grown, boxer-type dog was ly-
ing on the floor. His ears had been cutoff.”

“The dog was cowering, trembling with
pain,” Dr. Nemeth remembers. “He had

lost a lot of blood and was in shock.”

“He had every reason to try to attack
us,” Wills continues, “but when we petted
him, he licked our hands and whimpered.
We rushed him to our clinic.”

Dr. Nemeth anesthetized the dog and
cleaned and sutured his ears. “The scars
healed in two weeks,” the veterinarian
says. “But complete recovery took months
because the dog was so emaciated and
loaded with parasites.”

“We named him Jake,” says Wills. “What
struck us immediately was his sweet dis-
position. The owner tried to get him back.
He denied knowing that he’d hurt his dog,
couldn’t see anything wrong with cutting
his ears off—said he only wanted to make
him look ‘mean,’ like a fighting dog. In-
credible! In such cases, our objectives are
to: Get the animal out of the situation,
back on its feet, and permanently removed
from the person who harmed it.”

Roy Warner filed a detailed complaint
with the Detroit Police Department. Then,
under the direction of Sienna LaRene, the
attorney who heads the Michigan Humane
Society Investigations Department, a case
was brought against
Jake’s owner.

He was stunned at
being taken to court.
He had assumed the
dog was his property
to do with whatever
he liked. But the judge
fined him the max-
imum the law allow-
ed, $200, and sen-
tenced him to two
year’s probation—
with no pets.

The Humane Soci-
ety published Jake’s
story in its newsletter,
and offers to adopt
him poured in. One
call was from David

and Veronica Bathurst, who live in a
Detroit suburb. “I had the most compelling
premonition that we were meant to take
this dog,” says Veronica. “My husband said
that if God intended us to have him, we
would. Sure enough, a few days later, a
woman called from the Humane Society,
and Jake became ours.”

When Jake arrived at the Bathursts’, he
became hysterical with joy. He wouldn’t
let the family out of his sight, and for sev-
eral weeks he was so excited he was diffi-
cult to housetrain. But the Bathursts’ pa-
tience prevailed. “He’s still a big, loving,
playful baby,” Veronica says affectionately.

Jake’s troubles are over, but what of the
millions of animals who aren’t so lucky?
Most people wouldn’t have known where
to get help, or they wouldn’t have wanted
to get involved. Emily’s action illustrates
what a compassionate citizen can do.

“The fate of abused animals depends on
the people of a community, as well as on
the efforts of their law-enforcement offi-
cers,” says Sienna LaRene. Active concern
for the plight of those who can’t defend
themselves does make a difference. I

WHAT YOU CAN DO ABOUT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS

Both active cruelty, such as beating,
shooting or torturing, and passive
cruelty——failing to provide proper shel-
ter, food or medical care—are crimes in
every state, and anyone committing
them can be stopped.

I. Report What you believe to be cruelty
to the police. If cruelty investigation is
not their job, they Will tell you Whom to
call—the animal control department,

humane society, SPCA or other animal
protection group.

2. Give accurate, specific information.
The cruelty investigators Will need every
possible detail. (Your identity Will be
kept confidential on request.)

3. Follow up. If the appropriate agency
fails to act, report this to your district
attorney's office. Be pleasant but firm;
ask that action be taken.

4. Inform the news desks of your local
newspapers and TV stations if the laW-
enforcement agency drags its feet.
Often publicity inspires the authorities
to act.

MORTON PUNER
”LA SERAPHINE” - LA PIERRE PLANTEE
83990 SAINT-TROPEZ - FRANCE

May 16, 1985

Mrs. Christine Stevens
President

Animal Welfare Institute
P.0. Box 3650
Washington, D.C. 20007

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

We think back fondly to our lunch with you and your
husband in New York in March. We had been deluged with
letters and materials from directors of a number of
animal humane groups before coming. In fact, we met
only with you and Mr. Stevens in connection with our
legacy. Two reasons: We were so pressed for time in
our few short weeks, with family, old friends, and
literary agent taking up most of it. (I've written a
novel -- never again!) And we had, I suppose, already
decided to focus on your organization because of the
excellent materials you sent us_and your general approach.
Meeting you and ROger (dare I?) pretty much clinched it.

As I mentioned, leaving a substantial legacy to
an animal welfare group suits and helps us. I can't
specify the amount at the moment but it should be in
excess of $100,000. I'm not being chary here. I'm 63,
Adeline 61, and we still have some living to do and
somehow.never feel totally secure financially. Our
assets -- mainly real estate in France and accounts
with brokerage firms in New York —- exceed a million
dollars but Adeline matured in wartime France and I grew
up in New York in the great depression and we tend to
keep our fears. Still, we have no children and no compelling
need to leave much to nieces and nephews who are, well,
economically privileged already. Our good lawyer, an
American working out of Aix—en—Provence who knows all
about U.S. wills and tax problems, will get us to do the
paperwork soon enough. He insists: Can you imagine the mess
if we were both to die intestate? We're both U.S. citizens
and legal French residents. The two governments would have
fun fighting over our estate. We know, we know, but there's
a certain psychological problem in approaching a will.

Getting to an immediate matter. My interest started out

purely personal —- our love for animals and the need to arrange
for some beneficial diSposition of our estate. But in looking

R .

through the material sent by a dozen or more animal

welfare agencies, I became interested in doing a commercial
book on the subject —- a popular one that would also help
the cause generally. So I am now wearing my professional
hat and this has nothing to do with our legacy to the
Animal Welfare Institute.

A New York publisher has accepted the idea in principle
(although we have not yet signed a contract which my agent
will decide upon for me.) Enclosed is a copy of the proposal
for the publisher which my agent will submit. The book would
be made up mainly of a collection of articles by various
animal humane and welfare agency professionals. If you dis—
agree with any of this, or if it distresses you somehow,
please let me know with total frankness. Professionally
this is a new field for me and I can be as wrong as the
next man (and sometimes wronger.) I can think of a few things
which may be jarring:

-— I note from a recent exchange of letters in The New
York Review of Books that Tom Regan differs with Peter Singer
on the animal "liberation" concept. Regan prefers animal
"rights" and gives good philosophical reasons. I use "liberation"
throughout —— even in the title —- because it's a more obvious
popular and commercial phrase, although it may do a disservice.

~— My emphases and idiom may be way off. I may have
omitted major areas or interjected my own idiosyncratic concerns.

—- I'm here proposing to do a book made up of articles
by directors or professionals of a variety of leading animal
welfare groups. The book would probably be easier for me to
assemble from here -- and editorially more consistent -— if I
were to work with just one agency. (In which case I would feel
obliged to share royalties.) But if I were to work with, say,
just you or another agency, would I not be presenting one limited
point of view, only one approach of several promising ones? And
thus limiting the appeal and value of a book that I would like
to be as comprehensive and wide—ranging as possible. I really
don't know.

I know that your approach is more reformist than revolutionary
which suits me perfectly. We also determined at our lunch that the
Stevens' politics are similar to our own. Obviously one's politics
express a View of life and I think we share a gently liberal and
compassionate View of the world. Again, it was a privilege and
joy to meet you both.

Sincerely,

Mg:

The Animal Liberation Handbook

A proposal from Morton Puner

I. Body of the book.

a) About ten years ago, a Melbourne professor of bio-
ethics wrote a book describing "non-human animals" as an
oppressed group, treated "as if they were things to be used
as we please, rather than as beings with lives of their own."
In his Animal_Liberation, Peter Singer singled out two of the
least known but most common forms of animal exploitation:
Their use in laboratory experiments and in "factory farming"
in which millions of animals are perpetually locked into
cages and stalls so small they can never take a step or
turn around.

_ Singer's book touched a popular chord of conscience and
helped inspire todayis animal liberation movement. There have
long been effective groups dedicated to animal rights and
welfare; the English Society for the Prevention of Cruely to
Animals was organized in 1824, the.first American one —- ASPCA --
in 1866 to "treat all creatures with decency, kindness and
respect." But never before has there been so massive a network
of organizations, activists, writers, scientists, and legal
experts working in a broad field concerned with everything from
cruelty to household pets to "Save the Whales" and international
wildlife crusades to consciousnesseraising and all types of
"humane education." Many of the men and women represent the
traditional humane groups, some are newly arr‘ved from human
rights and women's movements, others come from universities and
sciences and fields of ecology and conservation. Together, they
serve as impassioned leaders in a bustling, growing cause which
seems to have found its time.

The Animal Liberation Handbook would be a practical and

comprehensive work summing it all up: the people and agencies,

their themes and exPeriences, how far they've come, what needs

to be done, ways to go about it -~ a guide to further action. The
bulk of the book would be written by heads or best—known and most
qualified people in about twenty of the leading agencies. As editor,
I would assign the articles with suitable outlines for each of the
authors to follow. I would also write the introductions and what—
ever is needed to give the articles a context and some organic unity.

The Animal Liberation Handbook Page 2

A foreword might be written by Peter Singer as a dean
of the movement or by, say, writer Cleveland Amory, president
of the Fund for Animals and one of the best known of agency
heads. The book would primarily cover the American scene but
be international in scope insorfar as it would compare treatment
of animals and progress in attitude and legislation in the US
and abroad.

I think the book is needed because 1) there have been a
spate of books on one aspect of the subject or another but
none covering the whole field and movement, 2) the movement is
now gaining momentum and this could be the landmark book in
its field, 3) most of the books and articles are heavily philo-
sophical or scientific and this will be highly readable and
popularly done, and’é) the membership of animal welfare groups
-— some made up of large donors -4 is substantial and easy to
reach. (See below.) For personal reasons -- also explained later --
I think I'll be particularly suited to get the cooperation —-
editorial and promotional —- of some of the groups. But, popularly
done, the book should find a general book market as well, not
just organization membership.

The Animal Liberation Handbook

I c. Sample table of contents and outline of topics.

(Mainly an impression of style and scope of the work
since authors and detailed treatment will be decided
in consultation with heads of various humane groups.)

Foreword: Why this book now?

Indeed, why the new international interest in animal
welfare and rights? This would probably be written by
Peter Singer or Cleveland Amory or some other well—known
leader in the field. The answer has to do with the growth
of psychological insights, consciousness-raising in other
areas, the relative affluence of the western world, more
animal experimentation, growth of factory farming, com-
mercial use of animals on a worldwide scale, and concern-
for ecology in“a threatened world. (3,000 words)

1. "We need a boundless ethics..."

Albert SchWeitzer's words, as used on the medallion of
the Animal Welfare Institute. The chapter will dispose of
the irrelevant question -- "Do animals have souls?".—- and
quickly trace man's developing awareness of animal rights
and needs, exploring the idea of "reverence for life" and
the philosophical base for the movement as well as some of

the differences in approach. I'd prefer that a professional
.“4+nn Hn+ c an +hig __ +h9 quhwpn+ iq pqqpntial

va-n-VGL’ I‘LQU

but can get awfully heavy. (3, 500 words)

2. Animal Behavior, Intelligence, and Emotion:
"What's on their minds?"

A lot. Some things you never expected, Some things you'll
never know. This will be a synthesis of recent studies in the
fascinating fields of animal behavior, intelligence, and emotion.
Probably the best author would be Dr. Michael Fox who has written
eight books on the subject and is associated with the Humane
Society. His special fields are emotions and needs of animals
and man, extra senses, animal and human awareness, and animal
suffering. (4,000 words)

3. The Laboratory Use of Animals:
"But how else can science learn?"

That and "It doesn't really hurt them" are the two usual
points made in defense of present practices in laboratory
experimentation on animals. But it does hurt them; the fact
that animals suffer pain, stress, and fear is a principal
reason why they're used in experiments. And a detailed answer
—— with practical guidance —— to "How else can science learn?"
is offered by the Animal Welfare Institute in its policy state-
ment on laboratory use of vertebrates. In essence, it says to
the scientist: Step back and think. Is the experiment truly
necessary? Can it possibly produce enough good to warrant the
suffering and death of animals? Will they be maintained in the

(more)

 




. ‘The Animal Liberation Handbook Page 5

best environments, with everything possible done to prevent
needless pain, fear, and anxiety?

Once in a while the issue reaches national attention, as
in last year's discussion about whether a baboon was uselessly
killed if Baby Fae never had a chance. But laboratory (and
sometimes cruel and uninformed classroom) use of animals is
daily carried on on a grand scale: Each year in the U.S. it
involves about 45 million rodents, 2 million birds, half a
million each of hamsters, rabbits, and guinea pigs, 200,000
dogs, 70,000 cats, 45,000 each of primates and swine, 40,000
wild animals, etc. There has been an Anti-Vivisection Society
in the U.S. for more than a hundred years. It works for the
prohibition of experimental use of animals and many peOple
assume this is the only position taken by the animal welfare
groups. In fact, there is a schism here and the American Humane
Society and most others work mainly to eliminate unnecessary
use and abuse of laboratory animals. The Animal Welfare In—
stitute seems to have done the most thoughtful work in this

. field and the article should be done under its auspices by
its director, Christine Stevens, or her designee. (6,000
words. Probably black and white photographs and sketches
illustrating ways for better treatment and housing of animals.)

4. About those best friends...

 

How well is man keeping to his end of the bargain —— his age-
old, symbiotic relationship with dogs, cats, and other animals
he's taken into his household? This chapter will be made up
of seven articles, based upon new research, to show what
we're doing right and wrong.

-- Cats: Divine or devil's agents? Obviously they're neither
although at different times they've been elevated to gods (ancient
Egypt) and massacred as demons (medieval France). This will
briefly explore cats' personality and intelligence to help under-
stand why they've been -- still are —- the objects of such strong
devotion -— and prejudice.

 

-- Man as dog's dependent. It started at least as early as
the Middle Stone Age. All—purpose dOgs, special—purpose dOgs,
lapdogs, watchdogs, seeing—eye degs, obedience training and
anthropomorphism. A fresh overview of the condition of dogs
in history which tells a lot about man.

 

-- Humane education. Why an ever-expanding urban population
needs it —- in home and classroom -~ at the earliest possible age.

 

—— Breeding control. Too much sex around the house? To say
nothing of too many unwanted litters. Why most pets should be
castrated or Spayed for everyone's peace of mind —- theirs too.

 

-- Problem owners. How some people drive animals wild.

 

(more)

 




.The Animal Liberation Handbook page 6

—- The right home. What's wrong with having a darling
little cheetah or tiger cub or monkey or St. Bernard living
in your high-rise apartment.

 

—- Checklist. Do you qualify to have a household pet?
If so, what kind? Among the factors to be checked are space,
time, travel away from home, your personality, income, family
situation, family responsibility, etc.

 

(Chapter total: 18,000 words)

5. The sport of killing

 

Three pieces:

-- Death in the morning. A somewhat elegiac piece
describing a stylized hunt, the ritual, clothes, drinks, and
conversation, the hunter's horn, the hounds, and finally the
kill —— whether fox, deer, or Whatever. The piece should start
off slowly, as though in appreciation of the hunt, and wind
up describing the terror of the animal, the sheer horror of
the kill. This would be the only "literary" piece in the book
and it should do in prose what the hunt scene did in Tom Jones
on film. (I seem to recall such a piece but have not yet
located it.) (4,000 words)

—- And in the afternoon. An answer to Hemingway's glor—
ification of the bull fight. It should go into the slow killing
of the bull, the obvious atavism and bloodlust of the Crowd --
and work to destroy the mystique. The piece would also relate
the bull fight to primitive violence in other arenas. (I'm
reasonably sure this piece has been done too.) (3,500 words)

 

-_ The hunters and the hunted. A survey of hunting for sport
in the western world: how many and what types of animals get
hunted; how many hunters, how many registered; how they kill, etc.
This will include some analysis of an average hunter's mind,
personality, social and educational level, etc. The profile
of the hunter part, certainly, should be done by a social
scientist. (5,000 words)

6. Smaller cruelties

Smaller because the animals generally survive although'
often maimed in one way or another. Two parts:

—— The misfits. The abuse of animals in circuses and many
zoos with suggestions for improving their lot. This will also
explore the cruelty of rodeos -— particularly in saddle bronc
riding, calf and steer roping and wrestling -- and the cowboy
macho involved in perpetuating such a pointless tradition as
hot branding of cattle. (3,000 words)

 

(more)

 




Animal Liberation Handbook Page 7

y -- For the fun of it. Such things as the docking of
tails, baiting (the harassment of animals by, say, setting
dogs upon a chained bear), and the training and use of animals
or fowl to fight each other, usually with a crowd around a
pit betting on a winner. To say nothing of the use of animals
in films, particularly horses who are often killed or maimed in
westerns or battle scenes (or beheaded for the sake of a startling
shot, as in The Godfather.) Even where these practices are
illegal, they are still widespread. (3,000 words)

7. The happier breed

 

Veal calves, laying hens, and pigs are principal victims
of "factory farming" which too often means inhumane methods
of housing and mechanical or synthetic feeding for the quickest
commercial gain. Most animal welfare groups are not calling
for a return to free—range rearing of livestock and poultry
(much as they would like to See well—managed, free—range
systems.) Instead, this comparative study of new and better
methods of housing, feeding and care in the U.S. and Europe
—— developed by farm groups and scientists and often supported
by legislation —— will show that the happier breed is also
the most productive breed and that the physical and psy—
chological well—being of animals ﬁsbetter business all
around. (For the farmers too.) (5,000 words)

purposes, often done illegally:

-- Ahab was mad. Stripping Melville's work of its allegory,
Moby Dick was attacked and sought to defend himself against "
a pitiless Ahab, little more. This piece will give the humane
position on the great international controversies surrounding
the killing of whales, dolphins, and other maritime animals,
and give an assessment of their intelligence, behavior, and
roles in the ecology. Probably to be written by someone from
Greenpeace International. (4,000 words)

 

—— "What a lovely coat". But that fur belongs on a
leopard or lynx or seal, lady, not on you. This Will be the
overall piece on wildlife, endangered species, and public
lands. It will also go into the killing, among others,
of elephants and rhinos. for their ivory. (The rhinos also
because of the misbegotten idea that their horns, powdered,
make a good aphrodisiac.) Probably to be written by someone
from the World Wildlife Fund. (4,000 words)

 

-— The Killers. A study of the extent of and those responsible
for hunting, trapping (often with steel claw traps), poaching and
other illegal traffic for commercial purposes. (4,000 words)

—- Slaughter: How humane? We've come a long way from
the conditions described in Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and
recent humane slaughter legislation is most welcome and
reasonably effective. But this survey will show that illegal
or inhumane abuses still abound. (3,500)

9. Vegetarianism: The uncertain issue

Within the animal liberation movement there is considerable
agreement on most issues; the differences are often ones of
degree or approach to the best ways of solving a problem. But
it is much easier to decide you can do without a fur coat or
an ivory chess set th1n it is to decide you can do without
eating flesh, fish, or fowl.

The arguments about vegetarianism are hardly new. In
favor of it are ethical and aesthetic reasons ("It is wrong to
deliberately cut short the life span of any living creature"
or "How can anyone eat decomposing flesh") to the nutritional
("The vegetable kingdom is rich in all sources of necessary
food elements" or "herbivorous oxen and elephants are among
the strongest animals in the world") to the economic ("The
processing of grain into meat takes up twice as much land
and far more energy than the original grain."). The response,
summed up, is that "man is historically a carnivore, as cats
and dogs and most animals are in their natural habitats. Besides,

.1. .LJ.J.LC 11.1de CLJLLL UCLAGVT'C .Lu 0 EUUU. .LUJ. ”[116. L60 it: gU at; 011.an

I think that many animal liberationists have some(but not

feeling that vegetarianism is popularly considered a crackpot
issue, that interjecting it would dilute the cause. A common
position seems to be simply, "Well, we're eating less and less.
meat these days..." This article should be written by a pro-
fessional writer, not particularly partisan, who will sum up
attitudes. (3,000 words)

10. The Ecology
"Frogs legs in Frankfurt, Malaria in Bangladesh"

Each year Bangladesh sends more than 550 tons of frogs
legs -- representing 12 million frogs -— to West Germany where
they are eaten as a delicacy. The problem: Bangladesh sorely
needs its frogs_which consume mosquitos and other insects by
the ton. The result is that Bangladesh now has more malaria
than it had when the frogs—lqgtrade started. It also has to
import more insecticides (including DDT) costing more than its
frog-legs revenue.

This (or some other example) can serve to show the imbalance
caused to the ecosystem (and economic loss to a poor nation) through
heedless abuse of nature. In its treatment of general areas of

serves the interest of all people on earth. (6,000 words)

Appendixes

 

1. Summary of legislation concerning animal rights state-

Editor's note

Two points about this outline:

-— It does not stress what I plan to do. Each chapter,
perhaps each piece, will have a connecting introduction by
me. Aside from giving each subject greater context, theSe
will also serve to identify the authors and give some highlights
about their organizations and work.

—— This is all subject to improvement. I may have overlooked
some important areas or given too much emphasis to relatively
unimportant ones. I'll be doing extensive consulting with
agency professionals to make this as balanced and comprehensive
as can be.

,Dear Mr. Weohsler:

Your splendid discussion, ”Pots noon a pat from pols,” was sent

to we recently, ané I thought you might be intorostoo to know that
a_Labor peer, Loré Boughton, put out a booklot entitled ”Putting
Animals Into Politics~“‘ His efforts have boon quite successful

in that British political parties have loin out positions which
they have promiseé to take. ' A

I hope you will continue to write on this subject. The ooints»-
you make are telling, ano it is well known that mail on animal
issues to the Congress often'is heavier than on any other oomps~
rabls issues at any particular time. This has been so over a
substantial period of years. If you go back as far as I no, you
may recall that President Eisenhowor, when asksé if he were going
to Sign the Humane Slaughter Bill, replied that if ho went by his
mail he woulo think that no one was intorestoo in any other'su‘ow
jecti

We are working for two urgently needed pieces of legislation now:
B.Rs 1797isponsoreé by Congressman Clarence Long (3., Mo.) sun go
comsponsors, an& S. 657 sponsoreo by Senator RObort Solo (3., KS.)
and 18 oomsponsorsi §.R. 1797 woulé eno the use of the stool~jaw~
legholo trap by prohibiting interstate shipment of those outmoﬁoo
'oevioes from which animals quite ofton escape by gnawing off their
own limbs. More than 50 other countries havo alreaéy banned this
terrible trap. S. 657 would reﬁnes the sufferings inflictoé on
laboratory animals anﬂ reéuce the numoers nsoo whorovor possible.

I would be happy to senﬂ adﬁitional information on both bills if
you woulo like to have it. Your voice woulo moan much in snoonrm
aging passage of legislation long overouo in our country.

. UNHERALDED by any
extensive media notice,
a coalition representing
more than 400 animal
welfare and protection
groups in 17 countries
will hold international
demonstrations on Sun-
day to protest “abuse of
animals in biomedical
and psychological re-
search."

4 The conclaves, four of
which will be staged in
the US. at regional Re-
search Centers subsi-
dized by the National In-
stitutes of Health, are de-
scribed by the sponsors
as the “single largest,
most visible activities

_ ever to take place on be-_

half of animals."

While there are no ad- '
vance projections of the

size of the assemblages,
large numbers are ex-
pected in such American
rallying—points as Bos-
ton Common.

The event is a re-
minder of the scope and

intensity of that large

fraternity known as “the
pet lobby." It also poses
the intriguing question
of why that lobby —- un-
like other so-called “spe-

6 put ”from pols  

 

By JAMES A. WECHSLER

 

cial-interest" constituen~
cies, has yet to become a
tangible force in current
national politics.

Its numerical potential
is awesome. According to
the most recent market
research figures at hand,
58 per cent of US. house-
holds harbor pets, ' elud-
ing 48 million dogs, 27
million cats and 25 mil-
lion birds. As local politi-
cos have discovered in
various municipal fra-
cases, there is nothing

frivolous or casual about

the devotion of vast mul-
titudes of owners to their
resident pets.

Yet even as the pack of
Democratic presidential
aspirants mounts, none
has audibly identified
himself with the major
current crusade of the
animal lobby. Their de-
meanor almost seems to
say “let sleeping dogs
lie." But are they asleep?

In calling for public out-
cry, Dr. Richard Morgan,
National Coordinator of
the Mobilization, declares
that the Research Centers

- funded by the NHI “have
consistently engaged in
brutal, repetitive and triv-
ial experiments which re-
sult in agony and ,_ death

for iﬁgemmrs‘éfﬁogs

 

Manx...» .,,.,,‘,,,. ,. I
safari-Mates and other

animals each year, and
they represent all the
greed, savagery and
waste of the animal ex-
perimentation industry."

In a single year, Dr.
Morgan asserts, more
than 70 million animals
are killed in experi-
ments in the US. —-
three every second."

Surely [in view of the
extent of pet ownership,
such rhetoric could en-
liven and broaden the
appeal of some strug-
gling presidential com-
petitors.

Moreover there is
ample precedent to
demonstrate the respon-
siveness of a large sector
of the American audi-
ence. In the 1944 cam-
paign, few Rooseveltian
utterances were as devas-
tating as the one in which
he invoked his dog Fala.

A

, expense,

Recallingthat the Re-
publicans had spread re-
ports that he had left
“my little dog Fala" on
an Aleutian island and
then sent a destroyer to
retrieve him at federal
Roosevelt
spoke out in mock anger:

, “You know Fala is
Scotch and his
Scotch soul was furious.
He has not been the
same dog since."

The roaring reaction of
his audience was appar-.
ently echoed throughout
the country.

Richard Nixon may
have been mindful of the
episode when he went on
the air to fight for his
political life in Septem-
ber 1960 after disclosure
of the “Nixon Fund.”

Tearfully reciting the
modest economic cir-
cumstancesof the Nixon
family history he told
how his wife Pat's men-
tion of how much their
children wanted a dog,
had produced an instant
gift from a Texas lis-
tener — a spotted cocker
spaniel whom his daugh-
ters named Checkers.

.4

That became known as
“the Checkers speech”
and, despite some deri-
sion from sophisticates,
it was credited with sav-
ing Nixon his place on
the ticket.

Admittedly an appeal
to the pet lobby will in-
vite scorn from fanatic
animal haters, or those
who believe animals
were placed on earth to
enhance the survival
prospects of humans
(through. medical ex-
perimentation).

It may also be said that
the human species is too
endangered by the nu-
clear predicament to
concern itself‘ with the
agony of animals.

But no political posi-
tion is invulnerable. On
balance the numbers are

surely on the side of the

animals' supporters and
sympathizers. Their
ranks cut across all
party lines. They even
include some who do not
care too much about fel-
low humans. Why are
they the forgotten people
of campaign ’84?

to her -— and congratulations to you as its publisher as
well.

I'm glad you found the illustrations and one of my
poems were useful in its production. By the way a sequence
of my,f3%§$%, of which The Roc's Egg was one, won the Canadian
national poetry prize for 1982, which was run by the natinnal
radio and television network, the C.B.C.‘who broadcasted it
in November.

To answer your question: yes, you could send a COpy
to my ST. ALBANS address. Thankyou, I would very much like

to have a c0py of the handbook -- quite apart from my contribution

to it. Actually, if you send two copies, I'll take one COpy to

\«m»...u._....._

the right person at Viking Press when I‘m next in New York
(which should be shortly). —— They've had some staff switches

in the past year, so I can't say exactly who it is right now.

Once again, congratulations to Greta and you, and many
thanks for your kind help to me while I was in Washington at

your home. Kind regards also to Maria, Fran and Felicity.

.to reprint it in the next Animel_welfegg Institute.Querteglg.

If anything can conVince Prime Minieter Nakeeone to rescind
the objection, your words will. I phoned staffers of two key
legieletere who were_ebout to meet with uekaeone, so I nape your ex
article may have been handeé directly to the Prime Minister an
the ﬂay it appeared.

You may think me completely insatiable. but do you think it
might be peeeible that you would write again about the steel jaw
leghold trap? The prospects for hearings this year are good, and
I can keep you abreast of evente if yeu‘d be interested. The big
U.S./Ceneéian trap manufeCturer, Woodetreem, bee finally come out
with a modern.leg snare in Canada. and the Eggonem is expected
t9 be in graduation in February in this country.

Elmer Davie who was imployed till his retirement by the New
York Department of Environmental Conservation. inventeﬁ a cable
coated leg snare which eveide the tight crush sf a steel jaw trap
and for that reaeen will not cause gangrene or break banes. we
helped Mr. Davies get hie invention patented. and we hope it can
econ be presenting a great deal of the ghastly pain and injury
that the steel jaw trape ceuee.

The last piece yeu wrote on trapping wee, as you knew, rep
ptinted in our beak, Facts About Pure and much admired. Did
I ever send you a copy of the Book? If not, I'& very much like
to éo ﬂo now. ~

Three short letters, quickly written, could make
all the difference in their lives for years to come—-
freedom. at last from the cruel and barbaric leg-

A letter should go to each of your two assembly-

form as it passed the Senate, and not to allow further
amendment or hearing.

That’s, all you need to say, but this is yOur last

chance to say it. If the bill isn’t passed by the Assem»
bly at its final meeting of this legislative session on
Jan. 9,’ it will expire.

If you don’t know your legislators’ names, you
can obtain them from the League of Women Voters
(listed in the telephone directory) or from your li-

A third letter should go to Gov. Thomas Kean

Dear Mr. McCaig:

It was good talking with you this morning, and I am enclosing a
copy of H.R. 5725, two leaflets about the legislation, and a copy
of the testimony I gave on the Senate hill, 5. 657 which is very
similar to Congressman Brown‘e bill. Aleo enclosed is our last
circular letter. I am not enclosing the extra material on trap“
ping which is referreé to in it but simply suggest you read page
two which gives the names of the Subcommittee members before Whom
I hope you will be appearing. I will be happy to send you more
background material and answer any queetions you may have.

I know that your testimony would help immensely to get this urgently
neeﬁed legislation enacted. As you will see, it is a moderate bill
which ought to be supported by the scientific community generally,
and we seek their supportw~eometimes successfully, other times
uneuccessfully. The lobbying of the Association for Biomedical
Research, a trade organization started by the biggest laboratory
animal salee outfit in the world~~Chetles River~~gives us serious
problems. ’

I am delighted that you are prepared to testify and will be phoning
you very soon to confirm, I hope‘ that you will be invited by the
Subcommittee.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens

Donald McCaig's splendid book, ”Nop's Trials”, accurately
depicts through the adventures of its dog hero the sordid
trade in dogs by bunchers and dealers who sell them to
laboratories for experiments. Theft is hard to stamp out,

and abuse and neglect are Widespread despite efforts by 0.8.
Department of Agriculture inspectors to enforce the federal
Animal Welfare Act. Impetus for passage of this law in 1966
came from the theft of a family pet named Pepper, a Dalmatﬁbn,
a breed whose special physiological characteristics caused a
New York hospital to order several from a dealer. Just this
year 13 pets were claimed by their owners from the Mayo
Institute in Minnesota.following a tip as to their whereabouts.

Hearings September 19th before Congressman George Brown's
(D,CA) Agriculturalj Subcommittee on Department Operations,
Research and Foreign Agriculture focussed on his bill,

H.R. 5725 ”Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals Act“
and oversight on the enforcement of the existing Animal
Welfare Act which H.R. 5725 would amend, and author McCaig
testified urging its prompt enactment into law.

Donald McCaig has masterfully dramatized the unremitting
struggle of a farmer devoted to his dog and of the loyal
dog himself to overcome the seemingly insurmountable forces
that separate them. The feelings of both dog and master
are sensitively described, and the reader cannot fail to
recognize the need to provide better protection for labora—
tory dogs. McCaig has issued a clarion call for help.

‘ aged, shaven-headed ape, while joking,g“It’s a good

thingthe' anti-vivisectionists will never see this.”

Dr. Dennis Stark, director of the laboratroy ani-
mal research center at Rockefeller University in
New York, said at the preview, “The past two 0r
three years have brought a raising of consciousness
among scientists, a heightened awareness of public
concern and the realization that the public pays for
these eXperiments.” .

. Stark emphasizes, however, that there hasn’t
yet been enough indication of the publics disapprov-
a.

“If enough peeple communicate their concern to
the government, officials will then respond,” he
claims. 7 ' ~ '

After watching “Man’s Best Friends” last week,
you ‘may'w0nder how you can protest this kind of

animal abuse funded with your tax money. If you

wish, you can write to Dr. James B. Wyngaarden,
director, the National Institutes of Health, 9000
Rockville‘ Pike, Bethesda, Md. 20205. '

In the ongoing debate between scientists and an-
imal welfare groups, researchers contend that labo-
ratory animals are well cared for, buttmany in-
stances throughout the country offer evidence to the
contrary. . ,

. For example, the July, 1984 bulletin of the New

England Anti-Vivisection Society reports that'in No- -

vember, 1983 the US. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) asked for a $10,000 fine from the University

of Connecticut for 19 violations of the Animal Wel- ‘

fare Act. . ,

The university, which was using animals in
eight different facilities, apparently was keeping ani-
mals under filthy, airless and crowded conditions,

without adequate care. The violations remained un--

corrected'for at least three months afterward, and,
according to another publication, some of these con-
ditions continue. *

* The Animal Welfare Institute Quarterly for Win-

 

 

ter, 1904," Says the USDA sought a $12,000 penalty ,

against the University of California for similar condi- ’
tions. In February, the American Association for Ac-
creditation for Laboratory Animal Care issued a blis- '
tering report criticizing the university’s animal labs
for sanitary practices, disease control, personnel
training and lack of leadership. One injured monkey
was neglected so long it had to be destroyed.

' The Fund for Animals issued a 52-page report

documenting abuses at the California university, cite

ilijigDinternal memos as well as statements from the

y The report quotes veterinarian Bruce Feldman
as saying he resigned in 1980 after six years because.

“I was forced to the reluctant Conclusion thatno.

to effect any fundamental change the critical

' problem was irreSponsible care.”

ANlMALS AND PEOPLE

Documentary focuses,

on cruelty in thelabs 1

By LOIS STEVENSON

This week marks the debut of a
film destined to have a dynamic im-
pact on the controversy over the use of

. animals for testing and experimenta-
tion. ‘

“Man’s Best Friends,” an investi-
gative documentary presented by
Frontline, will air in the metrOpoli-
tan “area on Thursday at 1 pm. on
‘lt’l‘iE'l’, Channel 13.

An estimated 80 million to 100
million animals suffer and die every
year in United States laboratories, hos-
pitals. universities and medical
schools.

In the past 10 years, the antivivi-
section movement has grown more
militant and has been joined by an in-
creasingly larger group of activists
who directly challenge the right of man
to “Oppress” other species. Both call
for a halt to most laboratory experi-
ments using any form of animal life.

Many researchers, on the other
hand, claim laboratory animals are
usually well cared for, and that ex-

_ periments are necessary for human
ealth and progress.

coverage in this hour-long exploration
of the physical, ethical and moral ram-
'tications of animal use and abuse.

“We tried to create a dialogue and
give the viewer the tools to judge the
rightness or wrongess of the issue,”
notes Steven Fischler, co-producer with
Joel Sucher. The two men Operate their
own independent company, Pacific
Street Films.

Fischler and Sucher did a marvel-
ous job of locating and filming many of
the ongoing experiments which inflict
pain, fear and suffering on numerous
species, from rats and mice to goats,
pigs, dogs, cats and primates.

Certainly, they covered those tests

Both factions are given ample'

tories, one of the largest users of ani-
mals; “hidden camera” scenes of an
animal auction in Pennsylvania, where
dogs and cats cower in freezing cold or
broiling‘heat awaiting their sale to
dealers who will transport them and
resell them to laboratories; the facili-
ties of a New Jersey dealer, who, coin-
cidentally, has since been charged by
the New Jersey SPCA with 32 counts of
cruelty. ~ _ .

For a cempassionate, caring per-

son, many scenes are difficult to watch,

although the producers avoided overly
gruesome incidents “because some net-
works are reluctant to air this type of
material,” Sucher said.
Researchers, including Taub, are
given ample opportunity to respond in
roughout the movie,
presenting the reasons for their work
and their Opinions regarding its justifi-
cation.
- A different feeling is expressed by
Donald Barnes, a former research as-

sistant (for 16 years), at the School of,

Aerospace Medicine, Brooks Air Force
Base in Texas. At the conclusion of an

episode picturing his work on irradias

tion of monkeys, he states: “It became
evident to me that the data were being
used only to generate more worthless
experiments, thereby killing and crip-
pling more animals. I realized theexl

periments were useless, unethical and ‘

immoral.”
t it *

Dismissed for questioning the ex-
periments, Barnes became director of
the Washington office of the National
Anti-Vivisection Society, headquar-
tered in Chicago. A

Present at the film’s preview in
New York last Monday, Barnes com-
mented, “I’m excited about this film

, because we have this much Opportunity
to get the issues before the American
people, perhaps the world. If anyone
came out on top in this film, it was the
animals, because. you see them being
used without benefit of their permis-
sion or being able to speak for them-
selves.” .

The National Insitutes of Health

dispense billions of dollars of our tax,

money for research. We are the em-'
ployers; we pay the bills for this ex-

perimentation. For the first time, we

taxpayers are able to see what we are
getting for our money.

This column pleads with you to

, view the film and see for yourself what ',
goes on in research laboratories. You
owe it to the animals to know what is '

being done to them. .

If you want to express your feel-
ings after you have seen the film you

THE CLAIRE LEWIS AWARDS FOR EXCELLENCE IN JOURNALISM

Why awards to encourage animal reporting? Newspapers and magazines
carry so many pictures and stories about animals that some people

think too much space is devoted to them already.

Unfortunately the enormous coverage is generally superficial and
frivolous. Animal problems are numerous and severe, yet in-depth

and investigative reporting is rare.

Exposing abuse and exploitation, weak prosecution of cruelty, or
sub-standard shelter conditions calls for initiative, integrity
and courage. When stakes are high in unlawful activities such as

dog fights, reporting assignments can be hazardous.

Subjects are endless. Why are live lures allowed in training

greyhounds? Is a high adoption rate the measure of agood shelter?

Texans abhor the thought of eating horsemeat yet slaughter one—tenth

of their 900,000 horses each year to sell overseas - most of them
healthy pleasure horses. The steel vs lead shot controversy is so

far-reaching, why restrict it to the sports section?

Frequent reminders about pets in cars on hot days are welcome. But
how can you help a dog confined in a closed car? Will the police

help? Or do you risk breaking and entering charges to rescue it?

Success stories are welcomed as well as those reporting the darker
side. The public benefits from news of the Black Beauty Ranch and
the "Bird Lady of Annaville". We hope to receive informative stories
that take advantage of the public interest in animals and add to

the awareness of their conditions.

Please enter and encourage others to do so as well. We see few

papers on a regular basis and solicit no entries. 1983 Awardees were:

First Place - $1000 Mary Barrineau, Dallas Times Herald
Second Place - $ 500 Charles Edgren, El Paso Herald-Post
Third Place - $ 250 Marydawn Webber, San Angelo Scene/Standard Times

$ 250 Seven staff writers, Longview Morning Journal

Ennlosed is a statement I preoared for the.?RIM&R comm

not permitted to give it all (I was cut off by ﬁlﬁ's Joe Helo
himself) I got enough out on Charles River to orevent further

The situation is bad because AER is getting its publicity
pringesd, and we are not.

The seewsaw of anti~ ané prowvivssection is being played to
to the hilt, and the proof that it’s an organizeé campaign ‘
was the packet of articles given to all hs0.attended the RRIM&R

ShouldVivisection Be Abolished?

 

By BAYARD WEBSTER ‘

 

DVOCATES of the rights of ani-
mals have sabotaged research
laboratories that experiment with
animals,

seal hunters frém killing seals, freed caged
animals from commercial fur farms, har-
assed whaling vessels, released animals
from zoos, and hindered hunters in their
search for prey. In search of public support

for their point of view, they have taken ad-'

vertisements, distributed printed ﬂiers and
vivid photographs that give graphic exam-
ples of how animals‘are sometimes inhu-

physically prevented .

A .

manely treated.

Such acts represent the philosophy of a
growing number of people 1n this and other
countries who believe nonhuman animals
are sentient creatures that can feel pain,
are aware of their plight and, like humans,
have certain . rights. The groups have
raised the consciousness of animal welfare
among many people.

The spectrum of animal rights adVOcates
runs from those who love pandas but hate

, mice to those who will not stepion an ant.‘

But the most heated controversy is occur-
ring between antivivisectionists — those
who feel that animals shouid not be injured
in- experimental research — and scientists;

and physicians who say that animals are
needed for research that may help
humans.

_ The Background

Until the late 1700’s, the idea that ani—
mals had rights had no credence in the

, Western world and the concept of cruelty to

animals, or pity for them, was nonexistent.
But in 1776 a British cleric, Humphrey Pri-
matt, put forth the idea that “pain is pain
whether it is inﬂicted on man or beast. ’ ’
This proposition was the foundation for
the animal protection movement that

sprouted in England and America, in
.~ the 1800’s. And as scientists began to
" find biological similarities in men
and lower animals, they also began to
3; experiment on animals to find cures 1
.1... for human ills, thus arousing antivivi-
E: sectionists. ..~

Dr. Frank Loew, chairman of the

v? National Academy of Science’s Insti-

tute of Laboratory Animal Re-

sources, noted that as the animal '
- rights philosophy spread, several fac-

tors caused it to reach its present

‘ peak of expression.

Dr. Ldew, who is also dean of Tufts

' University’s ,School of Veterinary
Medicine in’Grafton, Mass, cited the' '

publication in 1975 of the book “Ani
mal Liberation,” by Peter Singer, a,
professor of philosophy at the Aus-

; tralian National University, as one

such factor. This, he said, was the

'C “key event in awakening public inter-
, -. est in the use of animals in research.”

Other events that raised the level of

_‘ public interest in animal welfare in-
” cluded the revelation in- 1976 by the
, journal Science, as well as by animal
'~" rights groups, that the American Mu-
‘ ’ scum of Natural History was analyz-
' ing the sexual behavior of cats by

removing glandsmerves, or brain tis-

- sue from the live animals and study-
" ing their behavior. The Museum has
1 since ceased the experiments, appar-
;.~ ently because of the public outcry.

Ll

An event that received wide pub-.,

‘ . licity last year was the apparent lack
. of care of monkeys at the Institute for
. Behavioral Research in Silver

Spring, Md.

And just two months ago the United 1
States Department of

Defense
planned to shoot dogs to teach ﬂedg-.~
ling military surgeons how to treat

bullet wounds in humans. The plans
were shelved when animal rights
groups strongly protested the project.

nga'inst Animal

Research

Some of the animal welfare groups, '»

which range from the conservative

Humane, Society of the United States '-
-to the more radical People for the

Ethical Treatment of Animals, have

distributed dramatic photographs of,
\ primates, used in medical experi;

ments, whose bandages no longer
cover their wounds; snapshots of rab-
bits’ eyes damaged‘in chemical tox-

icity tests, and views of monkeys or
chimpanzees in straitjackets or with.
. electrical devices implanted in their .

brains. .

1 Animal welfare groups argue that
animals obviously suffer pain and -

that many experiments on sentient
creatures are needlessly cruel. They,
also claim that alternative testing

methods, such as test-tube cell cul-A

tures, computer simulations and

gene-splicing techniques, can replace
animal experiments. And they argue
» that it is wrong to experiment on live .
animals if there. is no perception of ,

some specific medical benefit to be
gained at the time the experiment is

In “Animal Liberation,” Dr. Singer
argues that the use of animals to
serve the interests of humans is as
barbaric and unethical as human
slavery. He also‘defines the exploita-

tion of animals for the benefit of ‘

humans as being “speciesism,” the
equivalent of racism and sexism.
The

antivivisectionists also

. strongly oppose some of the tests re-
quired of cosmetic and chemical-

companies before new products can

be sold or distributed to the public. .

One, the Draize. test, consists of put-
ting cosmetics or chemicals in rab-

bits’ eyes and noting the amount of'

eye damage they cause. Another, the
LD-50 test, for establishing toxicity
levels of new drugs, determines how
much of the chemical it takes to kill

.4 -

For Animal Research ’

Scientists and medical research-—

ers, often as vociferous as the anti- ‘

vivisectionists, point out that many of
the scientists Who pioneered the great
advances in medicine did so through
the use of live animals. They. cite

Louis Pasteur, who used'rn‘onkeys in
the development of a rabies vacCine; .

Robert Koch, who used cows to arriVe
at the germ. theory of bacterial infec-
tion; Joseph Lister, who performed
the first sterile surgical techniques on
horses and calves, and Elie Metchnik-

,off and Paul Ehrlich, who found a

cure for syphilis through experiments
with apes. . p ,, ‘ ‘

And relatively new therapies such

as organ transplant, joint. replace;

ment, kidney dialysis, bypass sur-
gery, chemotherapy and blood trans-
fusion have been developed through

animal experimentation, resulting in
benefits for both animals and

humans, the researchers say.
One of the staunchest defenders of

the use of animals in, medical re- _

search is Neal E. Miller, former
president of the American Psycholog-
ical Association and a pioneer in bio-
feedback and . learning behavior re-

search. In an interview, Dr. Miller

said: “If, as the antivivisectionists

say, we don’t have any right to exploit
animals for research to relieve .
human suffering, we certainly have ,

no right to exploit animals as pets, or
to eat meat, eggs, or milk, wear
leather shoes or furs, sleep on down
pillows or hunt and fish.”

Dr. Miller, psychology professor

. emeritus at the Rockefeller Universi-

ty, rebutted the argument that cell,
tissue and bacterial cultures can re-
place animal tests. In medical experi-
ments, he said, the reactions of an in-
tact mammal may be quite different

tissue culture or bacteria}.
Dr. Miller and other scientists point

out that while about 17 million ani- *

mals, including some 15.5 million
mice and rats, are used each year in
research experiments in the United
States, 10 million dogs and cats are.
killed annually by humane societies.
In addition, about 128 million cattle,
hogs and sheep and 4 billion chickens

”are killed for food. .
,_ 7 “Scientific experiments are a

minuscule part of the whole question

of animal welfare,” Dr. Miller said.
~ ' . But Dr. Miller is also a member of a
. committee of the New York Academy
. of Sciences that, seeks to preVent un-
I necessary suffering in research ani- ,

mals. He admits that the question

“What are the rights of animals?” is -

a theological and philosophical; issue
that is difficult to answer. . . 1
“There is sacredness of all life,” he

said. “But where do we draw the line?

That’s the problem. Cats kill birds

and mice. Dogs exploit other animals ,

by killing and eating them. Humans
have to draw the line someWhere‘ on
animal rights, or we’re dead.“ ‘

The Outlook

The answers to a hoSt of questions ’

about the» proper relationship be.
tween Homo sapiens and other crea-.
tures of the animal kingdom are
being. sought by scientists, .. theolo-
gians, members of Congress, physi-
cians, businessmen, industrialists,
Federal officials, animal rightists,
and ordinary people. .

But while the questions are being
argued and discussed, while the con-

sciences of animal researchers are '

being tweaked by public outcries and
while membership in the nation’s ani-
mal welfare organizations soars,
changes in animal experimentation
are slowly occurring.

Bills seeking to reduce animal re- I

search and improve the care and
treatment of research animals have
been introduced in Congress and

' many state legislatures. In' addition, '
companies such as Revlon and Bris- '

tol-Myers are funding research which
may lead to technology that does
away with the need for the use of

' thousands of animals in scientific ex-

periments. - , .
Changes in the National Institutes
of Health “Guide for Care and Use of

Laboratory .Anirnalsp,i-”ﬁtthe booklet .
that dictates. the animal/care policies ; '
of all Federal agencies, are being

made to render “more humane the

handling of research animals”. And, .

for the firSt time in ’ the .guide’s. 20-

‘ year life, public-hearings ‘ on its con- '
tents have been heldein Washington, .

Chicago~ and San Francisco. -.

Dr. Loew of the scienceacademy’s‘

Institute of Laboratory Animal Re-

sources has said scientists “have had ‘-
their heads turned . by public reac-
tion.” Although he believes the use of

animals is an essential part of medi--

cal research, Dr. Loew said that
scientists have obviously become

“more sensitive to the needs of the

animals they study.” ,

The scientists interviewed all
agreed that animal research was still
needed but that the conditions under
which it is done is improving and that,
as new investigative techniques are
found, fewer animals are being used ,
in the world’s laboratories. -
