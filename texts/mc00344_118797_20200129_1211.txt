TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF AN INCREASE OF $25.2 MILLION
FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION OF
THE US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001

Before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies
House Committee on Appropriations

by Christine Stevens, Secretary

April 6, 2000

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation is grateful for the budget increase of $25.2 million
for the Law Enforcement Division of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. We have been asking
for signiﬁcant increases for many years, and this is the ﬁrst time that a relatively substantial
increase has been budgeted. But the need for an increase over the budget is vitally necessary.

The President has proposed a $12.6 million increase in the FY 2001 budget. Unfortunately, this

f' amount cannot meet the basic needs of the Law Enforcement Division. It will not allow the

' hiring and training of new agents to replace retiring agents nor will it pay for replacement of
vehicles that have been driven 100,000 miles over all manner of roads nor for replacement of
outdated or worn out equipment essential for Special Agents on their own, alone on dangerous
missmns.

We urge this distinguished Committee to recognize the urgent need for a full complement of
Special Agents to contend with the major criminal efforts of the organized poachers, smugglers
and dealers who are greedily exerting pressure on wildlife which ultimately will drive many
species to extinction. The cruelty to the sentient victims of this trade is an ingrained ingredient
of this criminal activity. Its magnitude is highlighted by the fact that it is outranked only by the
smuggling of drugs and of lethal weapons. In fact, drug routes are often used by smugglers of
wildlife, and in Africa, poachers are killing the wardens who attempt to protect elephants and
rhinos. ‘

In the United States, Special Agents are protected by transfer, when necessary, and by
equipment, which is important for their protection. The loss of needed Special Agents through
retirement should be provided for by training more Special Agents now so they can get the

 




necessary experience to take the place of those who retire from the Fish and Wildlife Service.
We urge this Committee to increase the number of Special Agents rather than allowing them to
decrease at this critical time.

The USFWS is facing a crisis. The American public demands more protection for wildlife, and
Congress has responded by enacting badly needed laws, but the Service is severely hampered by
lack of funds. The Special Agents, who are the heart and soul of the Service’s Law Enforcement
Division, are diminishing in number because new agents are not being hired to replace those who
have retired.

Lawless poachers and smugglers, conﬁdence tricksters and scofﬂaws of every description take
advantage of the sparse coverage the dedicated Special Agents are able to give to our vast nation.
It is absolutely essential that their numbers are not allowed to shrink still farther for lack of
appropriated ﬁnds. The criminals who prey on our wildlife will be rubbing their hands in glee if
we should fail even to keep the numbers of Special Agents up to the authorized level of 252.

The knowledge and experience of the Special Agents and their dedication to their work, despite
the handicaps they are being forced to work under due to inadequate funding of the program,
must not be lost. They are the most effective force in the world for enforcing our nation’s laws
to sustain and conserve wildlife both at home and abroad.

Bear Poaching and Smuggling of Bear Parts

{The Fish and Wildlife Service should be empowered specifically to ﬁght the booming bear parts

~Strade more aggressively. There can be little doubt that bear poaching and bear parts smuggling
throughout the United States is on the increase. Bear carcasses have been found across America
with the gallbladders and paws removed. Captain Ron Swatflgure of the Washington
Department of Fish and Wildlife, for example, contends: “Ten years ago, I think it was a
relatively minor problem . . . Today, I think it’s a very large problem.” Bear poaching and bear
parts smuggling incidents across the United States became especially prevalent in the 1990s and
would increase considerably if left unchecked. Cases have surfaced from coast to coast:
Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Minnesota, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, California, and
Alaska, to name a few.

l{Perhaps the most celebrated recent case happened last year with the Virginia Department of
ll Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service collaborating on a
sting to uncover illegal bear hunting and commercialization of black bear parts in the region of
Shenandoah National Park. “Operation SOUP” (Special Operation to Uncover Poaching)
resulted in the arrests of over two dozen individuals for more than 110 wildlife violations.

Money is desperately needed for the Division of Law Enforcement to hire new Special Agents to
work on curtailing the illegal trade in bear viscera and to hire new Wildlife Inspectors to increase
inspection rates at airports and other ports of entry. Additional money should be appropriated to
assist the Clark R. Bavin Wildlife Forensics Laboratory in developing specific forensic
technology to distinguish positively the gallbladders of different bear species.

 




Honor the US. Obligation to Phase Out Steel Jaw Leghold Traps

Approximately 140 of 517 national reﬁiges currently permit use of steel jaw leghold traps.
These traps slam with a vice-like grip on the limbs of their victims, breaking bones, tearing
ligaments and tendons, severing toes and causing excruciating pain. Alternative traps, which
reduce the suffering of trapped animals are available and can be used instead.

The American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association and
the World Veterinary Association have condemned leghold traps as “inhumane”. The vast
majority of Americans oppose use of these traps as evidenced by numerous public opinion polls.
In addition, the states of Massachusetts, Arizona, Colorado and California have prohibited use of
these cruel devices by public referendum. New Jersey, Florida and Rhode Island prohibit use of
steel jaw traps too.

In response to the widespread international concern with steel jaw leghold traps, the US. Trade
~I’Representative signed an “Understanding” with the European Union on December 111997 in
. ’7 which the U. S. committed to phase out use of “conventional steel jawed leghold restrammg
traps ” The U. S Department of InteF‘r 1's respon31b1e for honOring this U S. obllgatlon on lands
under its jurisdiction and needs to begin implementing a phase out on use of these devices. So
far, no action has been taken by the Department of Interior to comply with this official
. 1’ agreement. We respectfully request this distinguished Subcommittee to urge the Secretary to
/f take action this year.

The Wild Horse and Burro Act

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation also wishes to comment on ﬁinds for the Wild
Horse and Burro Program. While the Society does not oppose increased ﬁnding for the
Program, such funds should only be used in accordance with the appropriations language we
propose below. In 1971, Congress charged the Bureau of Land Management (Bureau) with
preserving America’s wild horses. The Wild Horse and Burro Act states that “wild free-roaming
horses and burros are living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West . . . [and] shall
be protected from capture, branding, harassment or death.”

We are concerned that the Bureau is failing to ﬁilﬁll this mandate, and instead is engaging in
scientiﬁcally, ecologically and economically unsound practices under the guise of range
protection, resulting in a program which favors the interests of the livestock industry over those
of wild horses and burros. In fact, the Bureau recently presented a funding proposal to Congress
where thousands more horses than can be adopted out to the public will be removed from the
range, despite the fact that the Act speciﬁcally states that roundups are subject to the availability
of homes to which the animals may be adopted.

However, domestic livestock so dramatically outnumber wild horses on the range (the ratio is at
least 50:1) that the removal of these wild horses will not make a dramatic difference\‘ on range '"’“
vitality As a GAO report from 1990 states,“ .the primary cause of degradation 1n rangeland
resources is poorly managed domestic livestock (primarily cattle and sheep) grazing . . . wild
horses are vastly outnumbered on federal rangelands.. E.ven substantial reductions 1n wild
/ horse populatlons will, therefore, not substantially reduce total forage consumption” (Rangeland

 




Management: Improvements Needed in Federal Wild Horse Program, GAO, 1990). It should be
noted that less than 3% of American beef is produced on federal lands and contributes less than
1% to annual incomes in Western states.

The Bureau seems unwilling to conduct a candid review of its policies, due to threats of legal
action from private ranchers who keep their livestock on Bureau lands. Instead, the Bureau
spends millions of taxpayers’ dollars every year on a program, which is based on entrenched
ideologies, not science. In fact, many roundups have been challenged in recent years over their
lack of scientiﬁc validity and failure to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act. Not
only is the Bureau’s Wild Horse and Burro Program biased against wild horses and burros, but
often non-compliant with the law.

The Bureau attempts to address a diverse group of interested parties. However, it should not do
so at the expense of the very animals and the public land it is charged with protecting. We,
therefore, support the following language to be included in the FY 2001 Department of Interior
Appropriations Act:

Wild Horse and Burro Program - None of the appropriations herein shall be used for
program, herd and habitat management, including (I) herd population and distribution
censuses; and (2) range assessment and management; and (’3) habitat restoration and
improvement; and (4) adoption compliance monitoring. Further, roundups ofwild
horses and burros from the range shall be based on thorough data no more than three

years old, and also shall be subject to the availability of appropriate homes to which the
animals may be adopted.

We ask this Congress to ensure that the Bureau is not perpetuating a regulatory system, which
harms the very animals it has been charged to protect America s wild horses and burros are our
natlonal heritage and treasure, and should be treated as such VT

Summary

Most important is to provide adequate funding so that the Law Enforcement Division will not
lose its ability to enforce our laws. That means we must double this year’s budget request. We
' need to increase greatly the appropriations for the two following years. Otherwise, attrition will
weaken the Law Enforcement Division to the point where it cannot effectively survive. That
would be a tragedy of global proportions because it is the only such agency enforcing US laws

and helping other countries to prevent the criminal invasion of their own vulnerable and
endangered species.

We will be happy to expand on this testimony at the request of the Subcommittee. The
importance of this appropriation cannot be overstated.

Dear Friend,

The Endangered Species Act is under fire in the U.S. Congress. I
h0pe you will help keep this excellent legislation on the books.
You and your friends, and if you're a teacher or student, the
members of your class, can all help right now and in the coming
few weeks by writing letters to members of the Congressional
Committees before whom the Endangered Species reauthorization is
pending.

U.S. law protecting endangered and threatened species is the best
legislation passed by any nation. We mustn't let greedy vested
interests weaken it. The enclosed publication recently issued by
our companion organization, the Animal Welfare Institute,
provides accurate information for your use.

The next edition of the E0densere.d.-$p.e.c.ies-.tlaudb9.qls which you
requested will be sent to you as soon as it becomes available.
Meanwhile, this synthesis of important facts is available to you
and your friends and colleagues. Additional copies of this
letter and/or "America Leads the World in Preventing the
Extinction of Species" are available. Please let us know if you
need more.

Remember, extinction is forever.
Sincerely,
)7“wa We.“

‘Balanced’ off the planet

A stuffed grizzly bear may look like the real
thing. It may have fur like a real grizzly, teeth
like a real grizzly, claws like a real grizzly. It
may look big and powerful. But of course it’s
not.

Because the bear is dead.

That’s what some people in Congress have in
mind for the Endangered Species Act. They
know that the American people harbor a deep
affection for wildlife, so they dare not try to
repeal the act outright.

Instead, they are con-
spiring to kill it and stuff
it and stand it in a cor-
ner, so they can point to
it and say that, yes
indeed, we do have an
Endangered Species Act.

But its teeth won’t
bite. And its claws won’t
scratch.

Because it will be
dead.

The bill’s chief taxi-
dermist in the US. Sen-
ate -is the funereal Slade
Gorton of Washington
state. Last week, Gorton
introduced his stuffed
and mounted version of
the act, claiming that his
bill would “restore bal-
ance to an act that does
not now have balance.”

“Balance” is a critical

concept in this debate.
Gorton and others contend that the current
Endangered Species Act lacks balance because
it requires government to do what it can to
save a species, without considering the impact
on development or economic growth. As Gor-
ton puts it, the act fails to “balance” human
needs with those of endangered species.

In a sense, he’s correct. Under the act, the
federal government can decide not to protect a
species if the economic impact would be too
great, but that provision is rarely used. For the
most part, the act requires that the needs of
endangered species be given precedence over
economic considerations.

But that’s how it ought to be, if the act is to
have any meaning. Endangered species have
already been hounded down to their last hiding
places. That’s why they’re endangered. A

Species clinging to existence cannot afford to
have its needs “balanced” any longer. It has
surrendered all it can afford to give, and any
further “balance” would mean its extinction.

We face a pretty stark choice on endangered
species. If we are really sincere about allowing
our fellow creatures some living space, we
occasionally will have to change how and
where we do things. We will have to accept
some inconvenience, some self-imposed
restraint on human greed.

On the other hand, if that
inconvenience is too much
for us, if we’re not willing
to accept those restraints
on our greed, let’s drop the
pretense. Let’s repeal the
act outright and go about
our business, free of
hypocrisy.

Before we make that
kind of decision, however,
it’s important that we con-
sider just how intrusive the
Endangered Species Act
has been since it was
enacted in 1974. Its success
stories are obvious: the
bald eagle, the peregrine
falcon, the alligator. But
what has been the price of
all that progress?

Gorton and others are
full of horror stories about
the act’s impact on private
industry and property own-
ers. But in almost every instance, when you
start to examine the stories more closely, they
evaporate before your eyes, just as a distant
mirage in the desert disappears as you draw
closer. The facts are these: Over the ﬁrst 20
years of the act’s existence, 118,000 proposed
projects were reviewed by the federal govern-
ment for their potential impact on endangered
species. Of those projects, 33 were blocked.

If we as a society are not willing to pay even
that small price to preserve species, let’s admit
it. Let’s go ahead and see what the world looks
like once it has been stripped down to those
species that we ﬁnd useful. Let's experiment
and see what “balance” looks like.

And if we later decide that we don’t like
what “balance” produces, well, tough luck for
us. Extinction is forever, after all.

June 12, 1991

To Seminar Participants:

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation is taking vigorous new
action in defense of laboratory animals, animals trapped for their fur,
and wild birds captured and shipped from their native land to enrich
the pet industry dealers. We need your help as we pursue urgently
needed animal protection. '

Lawsuit for Laboratory Animals

SAPL has joined as a plaintiff in the lawsuit prepared by Valerie
Stanley of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. As you know, regulations
under the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments to the
Animal Welfare Act failed to set enforceable standards for exercise for
laboratory dogs and psychological well-being of non-human primates.

The lawsuit names the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Management
and Budget as responsible for this failure on eleven different counts.
The plaintiffs request relief from the court, asking that the
Department of Agriculture change the regulations to conform with the
expressed will of Congress. The case has been referred to Judge
Charles Richey, U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Steel Jaw Leghold Trap Prohibition Act

Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D, HI) has introduced, S. 1259, the Steel Jaw
Leghold Trap Prohibition Act. You can help by writing to your Senators
asking that they join Senator Akaka.

If you have not yet written to your Representative to co-sponsor the
companion bill in the House, H.R. 1354, please do so now. Over 80
Representatives have joined Congressman James Scheuer (D, NY) in
co—sponsoring the bill.

We await news from the European Council of Ministers, before whom the
Regulation to ban importation of-certain furs from countries which have
not prohibited use of the steel jaw leghold trap is now pending.

It is time that the United States joined the more than 60 countries who
have already outlawed this cruel trap.

Wild Bird Protection Act

A bill to ban importation of exotic wild—caught birds for the pet trade
has been introduced by Congressmen Anthony Beilenson (D, CA) and Gerry
Studds (D, MA) and Senators Max Baucus (D, MT) and John Chafee (R, RI).
The ban would take effect upon enactment of the Wild Bird Protection
Act, H.R. 2540 in the House of Representatives and S. 1219 in the

Senate.

 




The legislators also introduced a piece of legislation endorsed by the
industry. This bill, entitled the Exotic Wild Bird Conservation Act,
is based on a five-year-long phaseout, and its demands for increased
personnel and funding in both the Department of the Interior and the
Department of Agriculture make enactment within the foreseeable future
unlikely.

Hearings on the two sets of bills are expected this summer. It is
important that you clearly express your support for the WILD BIRD
PROTECTION ACT in preference to any other legislation on the subject.
Please let your Senators and Representative know of your strong support
for this bill. Your letters need to express the great urgency of
protecting many species of beautiful birds from cruelty and death and
from extinction in the wild. '

Recent undercover work by the Environmental Investigation Agency in
both Argentina and Senegal (two of the few countries which still allow
exportation of their native birds) has revealed repellent cruelty and
loss of life in capture and shipping out of the birds, many of them
unfledged babies.

Please write to the members of the Subcommittees before whom the bills
are pending (their names appear on the enclosed sheet). Be sure to
write to any from your own state and to the chairmen. Write to your
Senators and Representative asking them to co-sponsor the Wild Bird
Protection Act, H.R. 2540 in the House, S. 1219 in the Senate.

Wild birds should fly free, as the SAPL leaflet urges. If you would
like additional copies to enclose with your letters, let us know and
they will be sent to you.

If you have names of friends you think would want to help, send them to
us. Please indicate whether we should give your name when writing to
them.

It is important to encourage many letters in support of the Wild Bird
Protection Bill, for the big dealers who make the huge mark—ups to
garner big profits, even if many of the birds they import die on the
way, will undoubtedly lobby hard against the bill. Humanitarians must
overcome this opposition by encouraging all friends of animals to write
to Congress now.

Thanks for your valuable help!
Sincerely,

SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
P. O. Box 3719
Georgetown Station
Washington, D.C. 20007
June 14, 1991 (202) 337-2334

Dear Humanitarians:

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation is taking vigorous new
action in defense of laboratory animals, animals trapped for their fur,
and wild birds captured and shipped from their native land to enrich
the pet industry dealers. We need your help as we pursue urgently
needed animal protection.

Lawsuit for Laboratory Animals

SAPL has joined as a plaintiff in the lawsuit prepared by Valerie
Stanley of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. As you know, regulations
under the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments to the
Animal Welfare Act failed to set enforceable standards for exercise for
laboratory dogs and psychological well-being of non-human primates.

The lawsuit names the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Management
and Budget as responsible for this failure on eleven different counts.
The plaintiffs request relief from the court, asking that the
Department of Agriculture change the regulations to conform with the
expressed will of Congress. The case has been referred to Judge
Charles Richey, U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Steel Jaw Leghold Trap Prohibition Act

0

Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D, HI) has introduced, S. 1259, the Steel Jaw
Leghold Trap Prohibition Act. You can help by writing to your Senators
asking that they join Senator Akaka.

If you have not yet written to your Representative to co-sponsor the
companion bill in the House, H.R. 1354, please do so now. Over 80
Representatives have joined Congressman James Scheuer (D, NY) in
co—sponsoring the bill.

On June 14 all European Community countries except France made the
political decision to support the Regulation banning importation of
certain furs from countries that have not prohibited the steel jaw
leghold trap. A final vote is expected this fall. French
farmers/trappers claim they want to go on uSing so-called "padded
traps" that have a thin strip of plastic on the jaws. Please write the
French Ambassador urging that France drop its reservation. All steel

jaw traps must be banned. His address 15:

His Excellency

Jacques Andreani

The Ambassador of France
4101 Reservoir Road
Washington, D.C. 20007

Please use the following salutation: My dear Mr. Ambassador.

 




' ,/
Wild Bird Protection Act zééégzzojf'242;22;n ;%Z;4£§;#{

 

A bill to ban importation of exotic wild-caught birds for the pet trade
has been introduced by Congressmen Anthony Beilenson (D, CA) and Gerry
Studds (D, MA) and Senators Max Baucus (D, MT) and John Chafee (R, RI).
The ban would take effect upon enactment of the Wild Bird Protection
Act, H.R. 2540 in the House of Representatives and S. 1219 in the
Senate.

The legislators also introduced legislation endorsed by the industry.
This bill, entitled the Exotic Wild Bird Conservation Act, is based on
a five-year-long phaseout, and its demands for increased personnel and
funding in both the Department of the Interior and the Department of
Agriculture make enactment within the foreseeable future unlikely.

Hearings on the two sets of bills are expected this summer. It is
important that you clearly express your support for the WILD BIRD
PROTECTION ACT in preference to any other legislation on the subject.
Please let your Senators and Representative know of your strong support
for this bill. Your letters need to express the great urgency of
protecting many species of beautiful birds from cruelty and death and
from extinction in the wild.

Recent undercover work by the Environmental Investigation Agency in
both Argentina and Senegal (two of the few countries which still allow
exportation of their native birds) has revealed repellent cruelty and
loss of life in capture and shipping out of the birds, many of them
unfledged babies.

Please write to the members of the Subcommittees before whom the bills
are pending’(their names appear on the enclosed sheet). Be sure to
write to any from your own state and to the chairmen. Write to your
Senators and Representative asking them to co-sponsor the Wild Bird
Protection Act, H.R. 2540 in the House, S. 1219 in the Senate.

Wild birds should fly free, as the SAPL leaflet urges. If you would
like additional copies to enclose with your letters, let us know and
they will be sent to you.

If yOu have names of friends you think would want to help, send them to
us. Please indicate whether we should give your name to them.

It is important to encourage many letters in support of the Wild Bird
Protection Bill, for the big dealers who make the huge mark-ups to
garner big profits, even if many of the birds they import die on the
way, will undoubtedly lobby hard against the bill. Bumanitarians must
overcome this opposition by encouraging all friends of animals to write
to Congress now.

Thanks for your valuable help!

Sincerely,

(“szdZszs

To Humanitarians:

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation is taking vigorous new
action in defense of laboratory animals, animals trapped for their fur,
and wild birds captured and shipped from their native land to enrich
the pet industry dealers. We need your help as we pursue urgently
needed animal protection. ,

Lawsuit for Laboratory Animals

SAPL has joined as a plaintiff in the lawsuit prepared by Valerie
Stanley of the Animal Legal Defense Fund. As you know, regulations
under the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments to the
Animal Welfare Act failed to set enforceable standards for exercise for
laboratory dogs and psychological well-being of non—human primates.

The lawsuit names the U. S. Department of Agriculture, the U. S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Management
and Budget as responsible for this failure on eleven different counts.
The plaintiffs request relief from the court, asking that the
Department of Agriculture change the regulations to conform with the
expressed will of Congress. The case has been referred to Judge
Charles Richey, U. S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Steel Jaw Leghold Trap Prohibition Act

'Senator Daniel K. Akaka (D, HI) has introduced the Steel Jaw Leghold
Trap Prohibition Act. You can help by writing to your Senators asking
that they join Senator Akaka.

If you have not yet written to your Representative to co-sponsor the
companion bill in the House, H.R. 1354, please do so now. Over 80
Representatives have joined Congressman James Scheuer (D, NY) in
co—sponsoring the bill.

We await news from the European Council of Ministers, before whom the
Regulation to ban importation of certain furs from countries which have
not prohibited use of the steel jaw leghold trap is now pending.

It is time that the United States joined the more than 60 countries who
have already outlawed this cruel trap.

Wild Bird Protection Act

A bill to ban importation of exotic wild—caught birds for the pet trade
has been introduced by Congressmen Anthony Beilenson (D, CA) and Gerry
Studds (D, MA) and Senators Max Baucus (D, MT) and John Chafee (R, RI).
The ban would take effect upon enactment of the Wild Bird Protection
Act, H.R. 2540 in the House of Representatives and S. 1219 in the
Senate.

 




Please write to as many Committee Members as you can, especially
those from your state, and please send us the responses you get.
Thanks for your valuable help.

MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS IN CARE OF RESEARCH.ANIMALS MADE UNDER
LABORATORY.ANIMAL‘WELEARE‘ACT

A dog's life at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx is different today than it

was back in 1965 when Congressman Joseph Y. Resnick introduced the landmark bill

that became P. L. 89-544, the Laboratory Animal Welfare.Act. Resnick introduced
the bill after he learned that Pepper, a pet Iblmatian from Pennsylvania, had dis-
appeared and apparently changed.hands four times before being delivered by a dog
dealer to Mbntefiore and dying on the operating table in a research test.

At that time Montefiore's.dogs were kept in.small cages with minimum care.
Today, they have humane veterinary treatment by Dr. Ruth Kaslow and her Staff of
seven who provide individual attention, painerelieving drugs, comfortable resting
places, and exercise for their grateful charges. Postmoperative dogs are bedded
down in large cages with blankets. Dr. Kaslow has developed good sized pens with
plenty of wood shavings for comfort for dogs past the early stages of recuperation,
and more of these are planned. Her outstanding work in providing humane treatment
for research animals attracted a gift from'WARDS (Welfare of.Animals used fer
Research in Drugs and Surgery), and Montefiore authorized thousands of dollars for
Dr. Kaslow to initiate her program and to'bring the animal quarters and care up to
standards promulgated by the United States Department ofihgriculture under the Labo-
ratory Animal welfare Act, P. L. 89-5Hh.

Dog dealers supplying hospitals and research institutions that receive Federal
funds must now be licensed and.inspected by U.S.DMA.'s Animal Health Division com-
prising some 800 veterinarians throughout the nation. Records showing the source
of the animals must be kept by the dealers and by the registered laboratories.’
Humane standards of care and housing for dogs, cats, monkeys, apes, rabbits, guinea
pigs, and hamsters are compulsory in the dealers' premises, in transit, and in.labo~
ratories. Only major group of research animals not protected under P. L. 89-5h4 are
rats and.mice.

All complaints received from the field have been investigated by U.S.D«A.'s
lAnimal Health Division; and fifteen cases were submitted for prosecution, nine of

MORE . . . .

 




MAJOR Drama IN cm or RESEARCH ANIMALS (Cont.)

Which are being developed for prosecution.

”Never before have research animals been given the protection they are, at
long last, receiving,” said Madeleine Bemelmans, President of the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation. Hrs. Bemelmans, whose late husband, Ludwig
Benelmans', books and paintings often depicted animals, has been working for the
welfare of research animals for more than a decade.

"When Congressman Resnick introduced the bill that became P. L. 89-5hh, the
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act," she said, "he broke a sixsyear-long impasse which
had prevented any legislation on this subject from getting out of Committee.
Instead of being referred to the Senate Labor and Public'Welfare Committee and

House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, both of which had.failed to report

out any bill despite six years of pleading by humanitarians, the Resnick bill was

referred to the House.Agriculture Committee, where Congressman W. R. Poage promptly
scheduled hearings and prepared a Committee bill based on the hearings. In the
Senate, the.ccmpanion bill, introduced by Senator warren Magnuson, was referred to
the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is Chairman. Prompt, favorable action
followed. The bill was passed by a record vote of 85—0 in the U. 3. Senate. Now
it needs to be gylly,implemented,” Mrs. Bemelmans emphasised.

“There has been severe limitation of funds appropriated for enforcement, but
the Animal Health Division has made a determined and effective start. Its veteri~
narians have inspected all of the 182 licensed animal dealers' premises and some
50 per cent of the 1,500 inspection sites of the 532 registered scientific insti-
tutions. Fifteen of these experimental laboratories have requested extensions of
time to get into full compliance with the regulations requiring humane housing,
proper sanitation, ventilation, and veterinary care for their animals. Signifi-
cantly, fifteen dog dealers simply went out of business rather than attempt to
comply with these humane standards.

"Only once before,” Mrs. Bemelmans concluded, "has so much needless animal
suffering been stopped as the result of a law. That was when the Federal Humane
Slaughter Law was passed in 1958."

To Humanitarians:

We write to give you great good news about whales. THE
PROTECTORS OF WHALES WERE VICTORIOUS AT THE IWC MEETING IN
MAY (see enclosed "The Evolution of the International Whaling
Commission").

 

But we must warn you of the terrible danger looming for all
the animal protective laws that you've helped to pass by
joining SAPL's campaigns. (See enclosed "NAFTA's Threat to
Animal Welfare and Conservation Legislation.")

Please write or phone your Representative and Senators urging
them to oppose NAFTA until it is changed to provide firm
legal protection for ES animal welfare and conservation laws.

 

 

 

 

All US Senators are listed on the reverse of the NAFTA page.
If you don't know the name of your Representative call your
local library, newspaper or political club.

Ask your legislators, too, to co-sponsor three much needed
bills described below:

1) Representative Richard Lehman (D,CA) has reintroduced his
bill to establish the Office of Law Enforcement in the U. S.
Fish and Wildlife Service. This is the legislation so sorely
needed to enable our government to stop the epidemic of
wildlife crime that is sweeping our country and the world
beyond our borders. Ruthless poachers, smugglers and dealers
prey on helpless animals. The big operators make vast
profits from the exploitation, suffering and death of
creatures such as orangutans, bears, rhinos, tigers,
elephants and exotic birds, but all too rarely are they
apprehended and charged with violating federal laws.

As Congressman Lehman said in introducing his bill: "The
illegal trade in wildlife is becoming increasingly well
organized and commercial. It is often associated with other
criminal activities such as narcotics, money laundering,
weapons dealing, and tax fraud."

Congressman Lehman wants the Office of Law Enforcement to be
raised to the highest level in the U. S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.

YOU CAN HELP by asking your Congressional Representative to
co-sponsor H.R.2360 and by requesting that hearings be
scheduled on this important bill. H.R.236O has been referred
to the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee. We are
very fortunate that the Chairman is the Honorable Gerry
Studds (D,MA) the hero of the Wild Bird Conservation Act.

Please write him urging him to hold hearings on H.R.236O to
establish the Office of Law Enforcement in the US Fish and
Wildlife Service. You may wish, too, to express your
gratitude to Chairman Studds for his leadership in passing
the wild bird legislation.

All REPRESENTATIVES MAY BE ADERESSED: HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING,
WASHINGTON D.C. 20515 or you can phone your Representative's
office through the Capitol switchboard: 1-202-225-3121.

 




2) Domestic animals need your help to obtain passage of the
Downed Animal Protection Act, H.R.559, introduced by
Congressman Gary Ackerman (D, NY) and 8.367 introduced by
Senator Daniel Akaka (D,HI), to stop the cruel treatment of
cattle, pigs and sheep in stockyards where sick or injured
animals who are unable to rise to their feet may be dragged
to slaughter with heavy chains, kicked, beaten and jabbed to
try to make them get up.

The bills are short and to the point. One year after the
date of enactment, "It shall be unlawful for any stockyard
owner, market agency, or dealer to buy, sell, give, receive,
transfer, market, or hold nonambulatory livestock unless the
livestock has been humanely euthanized."

Enactment of H.R.559 and 8.367 will eliminate any financial
incentive to send animals to market when they are too ill to
stand and walk. At present, farmers who lack sympathy for
suffering animals ship diseased or injured individuals in the
hope of making money from these pitiful creatures. PLEASE
HELP BY WRITING YOUR REPRESENTATIVE AND SENATORS, ASKING THEM
TO CO-SPONSOR THE DOWNED ANIMAL PROTECTION ACT: 3.367 in the
Senate, H.R.559 in the House.

3) Chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese and quail need protection
from cruelty at slaughter. Congressman Andrew Jacobs (D,IN)
has introduced a brief amendment to The Federal Humane
Slaughter Act to include poultry under its requirements. The
vast scale of this unregulated activity can be gauged by the
fact brought out at Senate hearings on bacterial
contamination where it was stated, "More broilers currently

are produced in a single day than the entire annual output in
1930."

Everyone who has kept a chicken as a pet knows what
delightful creatures they are. It is appalling that they
should be bred in such quantity yet denied the mimimal right
to a death without pain and suffering.

PLEASE ASK YOUR REPRESENTATIVE TO CO-SPONSOR Hon. Andrew
Jacobs' bill, H.R.649, the Humane Methods of Poultry
Slaughter Act of 1993. ' "

Thanks for writing! You can take great pride in the letter-
writing you've done for animals over the years. It's you who
have made the difference for so many creatures. The Wild'
Bird Conservation Act, passed last October as the result of
your efforts and those of SAPL, will go into effect October
1993. Already the suffering and death of thousands of
beautiful, sensitive birds has been prevented.

Please keep up your good work, writing and phoning. Every
letter and phone call helps. If you want extra copies of
this mailing to give to friends and relatives, let us know
and they'll be sent. '

Madeleine Bemelmans Christine Stevens
President Secretary

P.S. If you can help by sending a donation to SAPL, we'll be
deeply appreciative. A self-addressed envelope is enclosed
for your convenience. Please be as generous as you can, for
funds are desperately needed at this time, and we'll
translate your gift into effective action.

Santeria ceremony

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — A San-
teria high priest slit the throats of
hogtied beasts yesterday in a ritual
sacriﬁce of 19 animals. He poked a
steak knife through the throat of
larger animals -— a black ram and
two goats -— then sawed through
vocal cords and arteries until blood
spurted. The rare public ceremony
gave thanks for a US. Supreme
Court ruling that a city ordinance
barring animal slaughter unconsti-
tutionally interfered with the Afro—
Caribbean religion. “What before
we had to hide, now we can do in
the open,” Rigoberto Zamora said
after pouring ram’s blood over an
altar dedicated to his patron deity,
Chango.

I am the product of a religious school;
twelve years learning about ethics, and

PEOPLE in America are concerned about what

People who nan do what was viewed on television with sheep, goats, chickens, etc,
are of questionable character, despite their 'religion.’ I would suppose that where
such practices are in vogue that there would be a high crime rate. You know ... cruelty
to animals vs cruelty to people, and vice versa ... like Jeffrey Dahmer, Son of Sam,

‘ Pigeon f

UT TOGETHER 12,000 spec-
P tators, 1,300 protesters, 750

town folk, 265 state troopers
and 6,000 pigeons, and you have
one of the most bizarre rituals in
America: the annual Labor Day pi-
geon shoot at Hegins.

This is a ritual that continues to
flirt with tragedy, as “self-righteous
tofu eaters,” as one of our letter
Writers described the protesters,
take on “the cruelest event in the
country,” according to an animal-
rights activist. V

Last year’s confrontation was
the worst yet, with 114 protesters

arrested.

Wiser heads in the community,
it seems to us, should be seeking to
put ‘angend to this cruel and barbar-
ic event before its dangeroixs mix of
guns, alcohol and angry words
erupts intaviolence. There is no in-
dication, however, that organizers
plan to cancel the 60th edition of
the Fred Coleman Memorial Shoot
Or ‘at least terminate the pigeon
slaughter portion of the program
for 1993.

, By one means or another, the pi-
geon shoot is doomed. It is an
anachronism from another age
when blood sports were common
and therewas little compassion for
the animals victimized by such
events. Dog fights and cock fights
have been banished by legal statute,
but pigeon shoots continue to be le-
gal events in Hegins and elsewhere

f- to growing public disgust.

shoot’s fate sealed

 

SO if folks in Hegins can’t
ﬁnd a humane alternative,
the state should outlaw it #

More than Once in this space we
have defended the right of the peo-

ple 0f Hegins to be left alone to .

repugnant and indefensible. We’rec-
ognized at the same time that there
is more than a little hypocrisy
among those who travel great dis-
tances to rural Schuylkill County to
preach kindness by hurling insults
at those they disagree with and
who manage to ignore far more
grievous assaults to the conscience
present in their own communities.

Nevertheless, we have reluctant-
ly concluded that the time has
come for legislative action to ban
live bird shoots in Pennsylvania, to
put an end to this needless and
shameful cruelty-to animals. State
Rep. George Saurman, R-Montgom-
ery, has introduced RB. 1415 that
would do just that, legislation that
should be approved in time to block
this year’s Hegins shoot. '

It would have been better if
Hegins had bowed out of the shoot
of its own volition, in its own way,
in its own time. But it chose not to.

Now'it’s up to the Legislature to
stop the violence against pigeons
and the potential violence among
humans that the event increasingly

risks.

Even though chickens9 ducks. etc. are considered food animals I do believe
that they should be treated humanely and euthanized in a humane manner. Years
ago I. and this SPCA, had the sovcalled "Easter Pet" 8111 passed in FAA to
outlaw the sale of dyed chicks, ducts. etc, and sale of baby rabbits that were
abused.

NOW comes time? or past time for these food animals to be protected from cruelty
in slaughter. congressman Andy Janina has introduced a brief amendment to the
Federal humane Slaughter Act to include poultry under its requirements - not too
much to ask. The Vast scale of this unregulated activity can be gauged by the
fact brought out at Senate Hearings on bacterial contaglnetign where it was
stated; "More broilers currently are produced in a single day thann the

Besides food animals. chickens can be a wonderful pet; delightful creatures.

SUPPORT FOR 3. 367 and H. R. 559 / DOWNED ANIMALS:
* e e w e a a e a o w e t e e e e w e e e a e w e a * JULY 1993

Domestic animals need your help ... Legislation has been introduced by
SEnator Daniel Akaks and Dongressman Gary Ackerman to step the cruel
treatment of cattle, pigs and sheep in stockyards where sick or injured
animals who are unable to rise to their feet.may.be dragged to slaughter

with heavy chains, kicked, beaten, and jabbed to try to make them get up.

The bills are short and to the point. One year after the
date of enactment, ”It shall be unlawful for any stockysrd owner, market
agency, or dealer to buy, sell, give, receive, transfer, market,
or hold NONAMBULAmORY livestock unless the livestokc has been
humanely euthanized.“

ENACTMENT 0F HR ~ 559 and S ~ 367 will eliminate any
financial incentive to send animals to market when they are too ill to stand or
mike

At present, farmers who lack sympathy fur suffering animals
ship diseased or injured individuals in the hope of making money from these
pitiful, suffering creatures. THIS SHOULD BE STOPPED IN A CIVILIZED socIETY.

We know that the aongress has many important pieces of
legislation, other than animals, but we believe these issues are IMPORTANT
and would not take much of their time in Washington; the legislation is
short/to the point and humane. No humane Con5ressmen or women, or
Senators should have any objections to these measures. YES, we know that

those who have $3$~interests will oppose the legislation for profit$$$,

but we think that morality/ethies should phay a part in your deliberations,
and to do what is right. - In - - . -.

Best personal wishes; and thank you for any votes for:
humane legislation you may have cast in the past.

Humanely,
