THE NAMING OF BEASTS continued

I walked a long way off, apple in hand,
a grey crowd of pachyderms lazily
grazing behind me. I bit deep

through to the core's bitter seeds.

The luminous canopy shimmered away.

I knew all the naked possibilities

of death. The fine drift of expectations
and dreams thinned and sifted to ash

as I clutched the dusk ember of self

and cried "Adam!" The bronze soil

/ just the color of skin.

I knew an ancient cold as I lay there

for a beast came shyly winding sideways
across the corrugated sands. He stOpped,
whiSpered his name. In a Spasm of terror
I slew him. I slew him!

The great bulls in thunderous convulsions,
trumpeting raw panic, stampeded——a chaos
of earth I barely escaped.

When I returned I was an older man

in an older world, my face white with loathing
and fear. I could see Eve would never be
satisfied; that she, too, knew the nature

of danger. That Cain was our child.

That he had snapped the neck of the lamb he held
with his own two hands. We ate the young flesh,
the taste of blood to our liking. Each day

we trudged to the hilltop. We tore at the doves

(stanza continued)

 




THE NAMING OF BEASTS Continued

and drew our crude bone knives over the throats
of lambs, an ugly work of fire

and stone. We shouted: "What do you want of us?
You can have them all back, everything
back but us!"

We come down in the grey to grey silence
of evening. The dark is no longer
friendly, the land no longer clean.

I face the flicker of shadow and fire

on the edge of the crawling night

and whisper each precious name: "Cheetah——
wildebeest——gazelle."

The Days of the Unicorns

I remember when the unicorns
roved in herds through the meadow
behind the cabin, and how they would
lately pause, tilting theirjewclled
horns to the falling sun as we shared
the tensions of private property
and the need to be alone.

Or as we walked along the beach

a solitary delicate beast

might follow on his soft paws

until we turned and spoke the words
to console him.

It seemed they were always near
ready to show their eyes and stare
us down, standing in their creamy
skins, pink tongues out

for our benevolence.

As ifthey knew that always beyond
and beyond the ladies were weaving them
into their spider looms.

I knew where they slept
and how the grass was bent
by their own wilderness
and l pitied them.

It was only yesterday, or seems

like only yesterday when we could
touch and turn and they came

perfectly real into our fictions.

But they moved on with the courtly sun
grazing peacefully beyond the story
horns lowering and lifting and
lowering.

I know this is scarcely credible now
as we cabin ourselves in cold .
and the motions of panic

 




and our cells destroy each other
performing music and extinction
and the great dreams pass on

to the common good.

Listening For God

Drifting in and out of sleep
beside the river,

I dream that I expect him.
My body cleans itself

of the poison of the night.
It is like the river,

moving mindlessly

toward health.

My head steadies,

light grows clearer.

On the sand beneath the willows,
near my tent, my dog

lies peacefully awake.

She is neat

with the neatness of animals,
wasting nothing,

hoarding nothing.

Morning is a perfect comfort

she can breathe in

as easily as air.

Her life seems better than a man's,
for she is Speechless,

she suffers nothing

like the whirling madness

men name language.

Because of her purer kind of silence,
I think she hears him

long before I do.

Yesterday, he might have been

faint birdsong,

far down on the river,

and the day before,

the dim roar

of the jet stream,

ten miles up.

But here, this morning,

near these sloughs of rising light,
I know that I will have him,

know that I will hear him

speak my clearly human tongue.

Suddenly,

behind me in the trees,

clinging to a plunging willow branch,
so green I cannot see him,

he clicks and hums,

this time a katydid,

to warn me.

 




‘ VOUNIATADES, OORFU 4

ln.the central part of the island
Where olive trees cover the hills
and the road remains unpaved

lies VOunaitades, a villagge
inhabited by Animals.

The Animals of VOunaitades keep
Peeple to 100k after their needs.

The Donkeys (the largest family) are taciturn,
voyeuristic and generous. Th

the People bring,fodder and

from the surrounding countryside.

Often they stand, soft—eared, by

to observe the comings and goings 0

Each small Donkey family within the extende
has at least one human who tends them.and

dwells in a cottage beside their yard.

By unanimous consent, the eldest Goat
serves as mayor and Spends his days
butting into everyone's business.

'His offspring, a noisy, gregarious lot,
wander the streets at will.

Red Cow keeps an old.woman.with hard
gentle hands to relieve her of her burdensome
milk each evening and to midwife her
births eaCh Sprin . Her Children are
dispersed among the villagers as she sees fit.

The Turkey parents favor Christina, a girl of nine
who minds their impetuous children and spoils

them with handsful of barley and corn.

Likewise, the promiscuous russet ChiCkens

employ the village youth to collect their eggs

(a necessary form of birth control) and to scatter
grain for their daily pecking ritual.

The arrogant roosters, however, distain the company
of People and sound their loud complaints

at the hours when they most desire sleep.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

POETRY

WITH THE CARIBOU

At the top of the world 1 want to go for a drive

in a primitive troika lightly harnessed to reindeer.

Behind three clove-brown creatures, yoked together

yet bridleless, guided only by a long pole

that the driver taps to indicate gee and haw

I want to sled over the alpine tundra

race through boreal forests of birch and aspen

and glide past the boggy taiga daggered with black spruce trees.

I want to leap up at the three-nation caribou parley

in Whitehorse, Yukon, to warn them the radionuclides
absorbed from the lichen they live on may kill them

if they don't drown in droves at crossings ﬂooded

out by hydroelectric stations, or slowly

starve to death behind oil pipelines that posit
behavioral barriers they dare not soar over

or burst their aortas trying. I want to advise the species
to set up new herds, to mingle and multiply,

else how can I hurtle with them across the Kobuk River

at Onion Portage, be caught up in the streaming southward,
the harsh crowding of antlers uplifted like thousands

of stump-ﬁngered arms? I'm slithering backward in time to
the Bering land bridge, awash at high tide, 1 cross over
nibbling down to Nevada, down to New Jersey,

I rejoice to be circumpolar, all of us
on all fours obeying the laws of migration.

Have they not appetites? Do we
plan for slaughter to ﬁll our troughs?

Their fat ones, despised, waddle large-footed,
their thin ones hoard

inedible discs and scraps .

called ‘money.’ Us they fatten,

us they exchange for this;

and they breed us not that our life
may be whole, pig-life

thriving alongside dog-life, bird—life,
grass-life, all

the lives of earth-creatures,

but that we may be devoured. Yet,
it’s not being killed for food

destroys us. Other animals

hunt one another. But only Humans,

I think, ﬁrst corrupt their prey
as we are corrupted, stuffed with temptation
until we can’t move,

crowded until we turn on each other,
our name and nature abused.

It is their greed

overfattens us.

Dirt we lie in

is never unclean as their minds,
who take our deformed lives
without thought, without
respect for the Spirit Pig.

 




M. Truman Cooper

The Man Who Empties Zoos

The keepers go to their hot suppers,
locking up and turning on the night lights.
Nobody knows how he gets in.

He discovers our forgotten names,

the ones the old Noahs used,

rubs the fur or feathers on our backs
till we arch and stretch and purr,
knows about the soft spots

behind the ears. All the while,

he is calculating our ways of escape.

"Remember, giraffe, the prick

of acacia thorn as you munch high, new growth.
Remember, meat-eater, the spurt of blood

just under the thin skin at the throat.
Remember, scavenger, how far the sweet

scent of death carries on a summer day.

Who are the keepers, to make you tame?"

One by one, we find our wildness again.
Without a glance back at the broken cages,
we head out for our original territories.
He gets us through, even the elephants.

 




LETTING THE PUMA GO

I'll make a perfect body, said God,
and invent ways to make it fail.

He liked to watch the big cats.

He liked their beautiful contempt,
yet imagined how they might change
and love him

‘ and stretch out near his feet

if he were to let them go.

And of course he wanted

to let them go

as he wanted to let himself go,
grateful for the iron bars, the lock.
He'd heard the tiger succeeds

only once in twenty hunts—

the fragile are that attuned

and that fast—

and was confused again about God,
the god who presided here.

He'd watch the tigers at feeding time,
then turn to the black panther,

its languid fierce pacing, and know

it was possible not to care

if the handsome get everything.
Except for the lions.

Hadn't the lions over the years
become their names, like the famous?
But he could spend half an afternoon
with those outfielders,

the pumas, Cheetahs, leopards.

So this is excellence, he imagined;
movement toward the barely possible,

Dream of the Woodland Bison

Adrift in this backwash
Of the sun’s, the distance
Which begins at the ends of wings
ls down about us now.
The season has run aground.
Only in the peripheries
Is the idea of migration
Something like the edge we live on.
The air here is gray
And heavy as sleet. Above us
The nations of mountains
Steel themselves
As against a storm that will outlast
The century, the Appalachians
Moving in their canted run
Like a herd of woodland bison
Over the bloodlines of history.
In those ridges’ worn turmoil
Parts of the trails remain
Where they gathered against
The rhythms of their blood,
Turning over slowly as a stream.
There are bones Still to be found
Among the trails they set,
The seams where their own contours
Were matched by the hills.
One summer I found a tooth
The size of a small boy’s ﬁst,
Bark-gnarled, ringed as any tree.
And now once more 1 fling
Their great shapes from it,
All about the brimming air.
I watch them form before me

In the Pennsylvania night.

Their fur absorbs the light

And in that dark they are invisible,
Norhing but eyes: circles

Glowing densely as planets

Whose music smolders in the cold.
They steam like smudge-pcts

Deep enough to heat whole worlds!
Above these hills their huge
Orbiting tolls through a sky

They are part of, lighting the dark
Side of my frame, turning home.

It is a rage against extinction

I carry with me, a dream

In the song of a tooth

Through which the universe is drawn
Like one last, fatal note.

coyote is my shaman. i shall not want

for learning. he leads me through all the
ways of his tricks, especially those i am
not fit to follow. he winks and suggests i
am too superior for such pranks. with his
thick coat of hair freshly shining from dew,
he grins and observes how lucky i am to be
born naked. i feel proud: my own teacher
recognizes me as an elite. he always stands
aside when i approach. he lowers his head.
since i'm not much at tricks, he helps me
cultivate wisdom; when i can't master that,
he teaches me posturing. he has no deceit.
he knows how to get along in the real world.

armed with tricks i can't perform and with
wisdom i don't understand, clothed in pride,
i enter the world for which coyote has
prepared me.

. such tricks as i need, i have
to invent; for wisdom, i consult old books
and mull silence; i take off my proud
nakedness and wear my ignorance with fresh
laughter.

when i return to complain to
coyote, i find her suckling several young
pups. she grins and says, 'Hanh! You're
not a coyote after all. And I'm only your
mother, not your shaman. Are you thirsty?‘

EARTH PRAYERS

W/e hear you, fellow-creatures. We know we are wrecking the
world and we are afraid. What we have unleashed has such
momentum now, we don't know how to turn it around. Don't leave
us alone, we need your help. You need us too for your own
survival. Are there powers there you can share with us?

"I, lichen, work slowly, very slowly. Time is my friend.
This is what I give you: patience for the long haul and
perseverance."

"It is a dark time. As deep-diving trout I offer you my
fearlessness of the dark."

"I, lion, give you my roar, the voice to speak out and be
heard."

"I am caterpillar. The leaves I eat taste bitter now. But dimly I
sense a great change coming. What I offer you, humans, is my
willingness to dissolve and transform. I do that without knowing
what the end-result will be, so I share with you my courage too."

THE MOUNTAIN LION

The mountain lion with jewels for eyes entered, panting,
my sleep,

as if it were his own.

His saliva was sweet as honey,

ﬂooding my mouth.

The mountain lion filled'me like a hand slowly forced
into a glove——

tight, tight.

Now the jewel eyes are locked to my own.

I ﬁrst saw the mountain lion in the Sierra Nevadas,
dun-colored, heavy switching tail, tawny eyes.

Idly trotting in the sun.

Asleep for centuries on sun-baked rock.

His breath hot and fetid,
smelling of blood.

The mountain lion’s soul is transparent
as spring water.
If it exists.

In my dreaming head the mountain lion paced.
His wisdom was sudden as bones being crunched.

When he leapt his muscles rippled,
his splendid skeleton deﬁned itself—
hunger in motionl—godly

in motion.

Passion ebbs as the stomach’s sac is ﬁlled,
the mountain lion tells us.

He eats without tasting,

he sleeps with as little emotion

as he wakes.

His blood is warm as sap provoked
by sunshine.

My breath comes panting, hurting,
with such animal heat—

The mountain lion with jewels for eyes gnaws ﬁercely
at himself,

beset by lice.

His heavy-lidded eyes. His great wet sandpaper tongue.
Licking, stroking.
Gnawing.

Drawing blood.

An ancient legend—a god’s weight enclosed
in rank animal heat.

 

 




The mountain lion stirs, and wakes,
and turns,

laZy and alert in the blinding sunshine.
If he has devoured human entrails

it was without passion

or sentiment:

only wet teeth gleaming,

eyes winking like jewels.

When I woke I was alone.

I am always alone, waking.
And at Other times—alone.
Alone in the dreaming skull,
the precarious head.

The mountain lion trots idly in the sun,
in the soundless rain.

BENEDICTIQN FOR THE ANIMALS

 

W/e ate no flesh in Eden, but afterwards,
when things got hard, we forgot

the peaceful kinship of that ancient kingdom.
As our teeth sank into their flesh

we had to deny them. So we said

they had no souls, no reason, no thumbs,

no speech. We were so different. We made

a chain of things to protect us—fire, medicine,

our locking houses, many kinds of clothes.

And we renamed them—farm product, fur crop,
renewable resource. Pray that we will see

their faces again in the mirror of creation,

the miracle of animals, their clear eyes

meaning more than profit to our own!

JEAN PEARSON

 




 

 

 

  

St. Francis and the Wolf

Those old wolf eyes had seen so many faces
of human hate that Wolf had come to savor

his awful power to make men tremble.

 

When he stole down from his hillside lair

to circle the city walls and slip
like death's own shadow into the streets
of the town, even fierce dogs, if alone,

would whimper and lie down.

The wolf held Gubbio by its high—pitched

throat, and he knew it.

But Francis knew that wolves, like men,

are made by God, and so he walked alone

out to the wolf's den. To the beast who ran

with open jaws to meet him, he spoke familiarly,
as though he were an old friend. His radiant face
and tonsored head suffused with kindness,

beaming down on the beast like a great full moon,

Francis said:

"Ah, wolf, my brother, this is no way for you
to honor God, your maker! All men cry out
against you, the dogs pursue you, and all

who dwell in Gubbio fear and detest you.

 

   

"But I have come to make peace between you and them.

You shall not slaughter any longer!
For every door in Gubbio shall give you each day

a share of food, that you shall no more

suffer hunger, nor the cruel bite of curses either."

  




How far can the word of man be trusted?
He must have looked deep into the saint's soul
before he, the fearful wolf of Gubbio,

lowered his great grey forelegs to the ground

and waved his tail in truce. He rose then
and gave his huge right paw in peace,
placed his wolf paw into the outstretched hand

of a true human friend.

And Wolf kept his promise not to kill,
loyal as he was to gentle Francis,
that all the world might know

how fear and harm retreat

where love advances.

Selected Poems of May Sart

Th Swans

I think this was a dream, and yet we saw
The stone bridge and the still canal,

And I remember how laburnum threw

A gold rain on the water very well-— .
After all, what we saw may have been true.

There in a rocky angle the two swans

On a small platform fashioned like a stage

In all that watery world were rooted ones,

And face to face, the snowy double image
Stood entranced there among the ancient stones.

Then as we watched the ritual play began;

They arched their wings full-span and shivered once,
Then gravely bowed their heads, and swan to swan
Lifted their heavy bodies in the dance,

Their long necks sinuous upon the silence,

Their long necks writing ﬁgures on the air

As if, like skates on ice, their beaks must draw
A precise pattern, and, what was written there,
Repeated with a concentrated awe,

Until the tension seemed too great to bear.

In one ecstatic motion, straight and pure,

The weaving necks were lifted, and each now
Stretched to the sky, as if it could endure
The little space between them better so,

And trembled! How immaculate they were!

Who would not pray, looking at such a scene,
To be alive, passionate, part of the dance,
And gladly yielding up all that is human
Become a part of natural delight for once,
Lovers take on the grave shape of the swan?

 




The Animals From Underground

“The grassy clods now calved, now half appeared
the tawny lion, pawing to get free
his hinder parts, then springs as broke from bonds,
and rampant shakes his brinded mane; the ounce,
the libbard, and the tiger, as the mole
rising, the crumbled earth above them threw
in hill-ocks. . . ” '

Paradise Lost, VII

In Blind Milton’s poem all the beasts

are named again; the ones with fangs,

the ones endowed with weaponry,

along with the shy or petulant, the dandies

and grammarians;

seen at the instant of appearance,

making their rough sounds, warning cries,

their sorrowful songs.

The earth’s crust shatters as the beasts break free,
like blackbirds risen from a loamy pie.

All those hidden together in that habitat,

born in a drama ofodours, Spurting

from the opened earth like ajet of blood;

some with careworn expressions,

others alljoy at being flung into the light,

the tender air, the rain’s warmth;

bees seeking their house, the lion his den.

They are the earth’s hidden reserve ofinnocence,
our allies, victims, rivals, friends.

The long-ago eruption ofthe animals comforts.
The ounce, the libbard and the tiger pace
haltingly through our dreams,

with hot guardian breath chivalrous and foetid.
\Ne promise them our love,

they watch us with their guiltless usual strength.

 

 

 

 




Roll Call

Red Wolf came, and Passenger Pigeon,

the Dodo Bird, all the gone or endangered

came and crowded around in a circle,

the Bison, the Irish Elk, they waited

silent, the great White Bear, fluid and strong,

sliding from the sea, streaming and creeping

in the gathering darkness, nose down,
bowing to earth its tapered head,

where the Black—footed ferret, paws folded,
stood in the center surveying the multitude

and spoke for us all: "Dearly beloved," it said.

William Stafford

 




 

 

Rhinoceros

I have never seen that beast,

with his snout bearing a pagoda

and his eyes like little fragments
and his haunches carrying hills

with them. His teeth, I have read,
are monuments, and his heart colder
than a key in winter,

though he sweats from pores round as goblets
and full of swamps.

The white hunters have killed him

a thousand times over.

I think of myself walking toward him
and preaching a love of creatures,
leaves in my palm, or a loaf of sugar,
and his great horn still,

the knees waiting,

and between us, like birds,

a twittering hope,

or merely the pause
between monster and monster.

THE NXMING OF BEASTS

I wasn't always a scratcher of dust
feeding my fire with buffalo dung here

on the edge of this dun colored wadi.

I entered the smooth easy pleasures

of leopards, knew the gazelle's high grace,
and all the wide world laid down in order
before me. That day is a dream,

full of a child's immense hours, minutes
as long as days, sky an Egyptian blue.

A golden land emerald and cochineal.

We were a kingdom of miracles that day

of the naming. Each creature came forward
in turn and I rested my hands on its head,
whiSpered to it the mantra of its name.

It was an ordination of beasts——the giraffe
gamboling off with high vision; Cheetahs
an ecstasy of speed and precision.

Even under the blue stars, insects

sawed their wild sonatas of names.

So the lion walked with the wildebeest

and the condor flew with the swan.

They went before us, and followed, While Eve
walked among them over the wide savannas

of Eden. There was no talk of ribs

or dominion, no knowledge of death.

No. Rather the issue of fruits. I stood
in the orchard, knew there was more to know.
The joy of the names I gave was never

my own. I felt undone even with Eve.

VOUNIATADES, CORFU 2

The Dogs and Cats feed on table scraps

of the People. They are regarded as

obsequious and low—class by the other Animals
but lead lives of undisturbed tranquility.

To please the Animals, the People paint

their houses pink, blue and green and plant
various bright flowers in old olive—oil tins.
During the winter rains, the People gather

in their coffee bar to endlessly

discuss the pirvate lives of the Animals——
their health, their romances and affairs,

the progress and promise of each Animal Child.

Thus has vounaitades survived the centuries
in harmony, without dispute or greed. '
