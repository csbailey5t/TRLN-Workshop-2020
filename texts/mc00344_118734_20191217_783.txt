Dear Mr. and Mrs. Breit:

It was kind of you to take the time to
let us know your approval of our use of humane
slaughtering methods. Currently many packers are
studying various methods of humane slaughter and
it is felt that progress is being made in this
direction. Both the United States Department of
Agriculture and packers generally are doing every-
thing they can to handle all animals as gently as
possible.

Thank you again for your interest in
our organization. With kind personal regards,
I am

QﬁwqukaBmﬂMu October 9, 1956.

Mr. and Mrs. wm. Breit
85# Second Avenue
New'York, New York.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Breit:

We appreciate the motives which prompted your card of September 27.
Without wishing to appear contentious, should like to point out, however,
that the term "humane" is a relative one. As long as the human race uses
meat as food, there are some who might contend that the slaughtering of
animals by any means whatever might be considered inhumane.

The objectives of those interested in the subject have been concerned
with "more humane" methods of slaughter, and we believe that this distinc-
tion.has been overlooked in the statements and the editorials which have
been written, many of which are by those who have little or no knowledge or
familiarity with the background of the problem.

Other methods of dispatching livestock may be developed in the future
which may be considered more humane. By any reasonable criterion, however,
our present practice does not involve torture or cruelty as implied by some.

Since 1929 a Joint Committee comprised.of representatives from the
American Meat Institute, for the meat packing industry, and from The Ameri-
can Humane Association has been collaborating for the purpose of developing
improved methods of livestock slaughter.

Attached is a copy of a Joint Statement issued March 26, 1956, by The
American Humane Association and the American Meat Institute concerning the
endeavors and the objectives of this Joint Committee.

During the period since 1929 the Joint Committee has investigated and
considered many methods which were proposed as a solution for the problem.
A full review of the activities of this committee would, of course, be
lengthy; but the brief comments following on two of the methods most fre-
quently mentioned will serve to illustrate some of the practical problems.

Over a period of twenty-five years Swift & Company has carried out
extensive work in an endeavor to stun hogs with electric current, while
another large packer undertook the application to cattle. While stunning
with electric current is used extensively in Europe, we have been unable in
this country to overcome effects caused by the current which would result
in serious economic losses. The application of electric current to cattle

resulted in a disfiguration of the loin, due, apparently, to the bursting

po FORM c 3945

 




Mr. and Mrs. Breit lO/ﬂ/56

of minor blood vessels. In appearance, the eye of the loin, on quartering.
the side of beef, revealed a myriad of small red dots. By reason of this
appearance on the choicest out of beef, the value was drastically reduced.
As this condition occurs on an appreciable percentage of the carcasses, a
serious economic loss would result with electrical stunning of cattle.

In the application of electrical stunning to hogs, a large percentage
of the lungs of such animals developed markings or lesions which were indis-
tinguishable from those present in the early stages of certain diseases and,
hence, resulted in confusion in post mortem examination by the Federal Meat
Inspection Service. If electrical stunning were applied to hogs, an appre-
ciable percentage of carcasses would be condemned on suspicion which would
otherwise be sound and wholesome. Considerable effort was expended which
would obviate the markings on the lungs. The industry retained Dr. J. P.
Simonds, Professor of Pathology at Northwestern University, to study the
problem. After several years in this effort, Dr. Shmonds was forced to the
conclusion that, first, no current was found which would not induce the
markings on the lungs, and, second, there were no Obvious distinguishable
characteristics between the markings caused by electrical stunning and those
due to disease. ‘

Difficulties in applying electrical stunning to livestock are not
limited to the experience of the industry in this country. On.July l, 195%,
the stunning of hogs with electric current became mandatory by law in Deny
mark. Due to an impairment observed in the quality of the product, however,
this legislation was suspended in February of 1955, pending further study
and investigation. On May 1 of this year legislation was reinstated; but
the action of the Danish Government indicates that the use of electrical
current for stunning livestock is not without some question.

Considerable publicity has been given recently to the use of carbon
dioxide by one Midwest packer for immobilizing hogs. This development is
relatively new, and we believe further time should.be permitted for a true
evaluation of the merits of this method. Notwithstanding statements to the
contrary, considerable investment will be required in most plants for the
installation of facilities to use this method. Further, in the past some
of those interested in the humane movement have not favored the use of car-
bon dioxide for stunning livestock as the method did not meet their criterion
for humane slaughter. While some claim the action of carbon dioxide to be
that of an anesthetic, there are other scientists who hold that the anesthesia
effect is minor and that, in reality, the animals are asphyxiated through a
lack of oxygen. (Many of the animals exhibit the symptoms present in suffo»
cation.) No one can say at this time whether the animal suffers anguish
from suffocation before unconsciousness occurs, as the subject has not been
explored by thorough impartial scientific study. we believe further time
should be taken before reaching a conclusion.

The industry has been co-operating through the Joint Committee in test-
ing a new stunning instrument under development by one of the leading arms
manufacturers in the country. Swift & Company has been using the new instru-
ment for over a month in regular operation for stunning cattle. Within a

 




Mr. and Mrs. Breit 10/4/56

month twenty plants of Swift & Company will receive and place in operation
the new type stunning instrument for cattle. The results to date have been
encouraging, and we are hopeful that it may soon provide, in part, at least,
a solution for the problem.

Swift & Company is fully aware of its responsibility to develop
improved methods of slaughtering and intends to continue, in co-cperation
with The American Humane association and its affiliates, to proceed carefully
and conscientiously to find an answer to the problem. '

Sincerely yours,

W

Dear friend:

Thank you for sending us the news release and quota-
tions from neWSpaper editorials and articles. They
are certainly encouraging. The Washington Times-
Herald, before its merger with The Washington Post,
used to give considerable space to anti-vivisection
campaigns. Perhaps similar 000peration can be hoped
for in the future.

In the forthcoming September issue of this Newsletter

the observance of WORLD DAY FOR ANIMALS - October 4th.
This is the day dedicated to St. Francis of Assisi,

the Patron Saint of all Animals. We are advocating —
Vegetarian Food Production, Furs Made From Fabrics,

CARL H. LAM BACH
ATTORNEY AND COUNSELOR
DAVENPORT BANK BUILDING
DAVENPORT, IOWA

May 3, 1956

Mrs. Christine Stevens
270 Park Avenue
New York 17, New York.

Dear Mr s . Stevens:

I have your memo of April 30th concerning pending
legislation in respect to improvement of methods of slaughter of live
stock. Both Senator Hickenlooper and Senator Martin are very good
personal friends of mine and I have already been in correspondence
with them about this legislation. The same is true with Congressman
Schwengel from this District. I have every reason to believe that they
will support this legislation. What may be developed in commmittee
hearings, of course, remains to be seen. Additionally those familiar
with the problem of securing legislation on any subject recognize
that legislative bodies move with considerable deliveration and delay.

At the moment those of us who are not experts on
the subject have accepted the declaration that such methods are
feasible. This would seem to be substantiated by the fact that they
are in use in other countries. I would say though that some degree
of patience will be required notwithstanding the fact that we may have
established the necessity and the wisdom of such legislation. I mention
this because of the fact that a number of,perhaps well meaning but
misguided, persons have suggested that the American Humane
Association was blocking this legislation and had recommended its
postponement in the previous session of Congress.

This was a complete misstatement of facts. It
was evident that a Committee report, if forced at that time, would
be adverse to the passage of the Bill and would have meant that the
Bill would not be further considered during the pending Session of
Congress. Perhaps it was not understood that the present Session
of Congress is a continuation after adjournment of the Session begun
last year. Consequently this is the same Session and such a report
forecloses consideration of the Bill for all practical purposes for

 




Page 2. 5/3/56

the balance of the Session. With that in mind action was deferred
so that the Bill remained in the hands of the Committee for con-
sideration, which it is now about to receive.

I do not wish to infer that any one should drage
his feet in this matter nor diminish his.efforts to secure the passage
of apprOpriate legislation. However recrimination incident to the
making of such effort is not calculated to further the interest of this

cause.

More recently I have heard the suggestion that the
Eisenhower administration is Opposing the Bill. I know of no basis for
such assertion and very much doubt whether the person making the
statement has any better basis for it. It is true that the Department
of Agriculture has in the past suggested objections to certain methods.
Those objections were as you know based upon practical and pecuniary
considerations of the effect of those methods upon the appearance of
the dressed meat or otherwise because of the difficulties that developed
incident to the inspection. Presumably these objections have now been
met. In all events the financial side of this matter must be given some
measure of consideration. To what extent humane consideration may
outweight some additional admitted costs in slaughtering is a question
about which there may be a wide difference of opinion. I assume also
that a legislator might well give more consideration to the financial
side than any humanitarian would be willing to do.

Now that the movement has taken shape and has a
growing impetus I am of the definite opinion that we shall secure
legislation. I would not go so far as to assert that it will be entirely
satisfactory. In fact it is more than likely not to be so to many, but
will, however, represent a forward step. Once the door has been
opened, the way is then cleared for strengthening such legislation at
subsequent Sessions of Congress. Up until this time there has not been
too much concerted thinging and effort.

I send you my very best personal regards.
Sincerel yours,

1/W

Dear Miss ﬁtevens:

I have just received your latest
request that letters be written to the House Comm-
ittee on Agriculture re the humane legislation bill
now before the Committee.

I have written as requested, but
feel that it is time wasted as the members of this
cemmittce are probably the run of the mill tvpe sf
politicians quite willing to yield to pressure from
the meat packers to kill the bill.

I think that a better way to
accomplish your purpose would be to interview the
heads of the big packing industries personally,and
sell them on the fact that their opposition to the
bill is bad public relations on their part. The power
industries woke up too late to the fact that they had
antagonized a great group of people by failure to
cooperate in its reasonable demands, and they are now
having an uphill job in their efforts to cultivate
friendly relations with their customers. The packers
will learn eventually that they are not exempt from
reprisals by the public. For example, at this Ranch
we buy nothing but Hormel pork products because we
know that company slaughters mercifully.

Please call the attention of your
Committee to this point of View, and oblige,

Vonrs sdncerely, g? MFA

SENATE COMMITTEE WILL OSVIOUSLY NOT KNOW THAT. THE LETTERS WILL GO UNDER THE NANE
OF OUR PRESIDENT A MRS. NARREN.
DURING THE DISCUSSION GONE SUGGESTIONS WERE NADE SY THE MEMBERS TO HAVE

THE HUNAINE SLAUGHTER BILL SECONE BETTER KNOWN HERE IN TEXAS, I DO NOT KNOW HOW
HELPFUL THEY WILL BE BUT HILL FASS THEM ON TO YOU FOR THAT THEY ARE NORTH. MRS. HALLEY,
WHO OORKS IN ONE OF THE VETERINARY HOSPITALS HERE IN AUSTIN AND IS INDIRECTLY ASSOCIATED
NITH THE TEXAS VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. ASKED IF ANY INFORMATION HAD BEEN SENT
TO THE NATIONAL VETERINARY ASSOCIATION OR To THE STATE ASSOCIATION. I DID NOT RNOO JUST
NHAT HAD BEEN DONE IN THAT DIRECTION. BUT SHE TOLD US THAT HOST STATE AND NATIONAL
LEGISLATIﬁN DEALING OITH HUMANITARIAN RROSLENS CAN INTO THEIR OFFICE VIA THE STATE
OR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AND TO HER KNOWLEDGE THEY HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY NFORNATION ON THE
HUNAINE SLAUGHTER BILL, OUR LOCAL AUSTIN RARER IS DEVOID OF ANY NENTION OF THE SILL.
SHE GAVE ME THE ADDRESS OF EACH ORGANIZATION NHICH I WILL PASS ON TO YOU:

ANERICAN VETERINARY ASSOCIATION

I DO HOPE THAT IT WILL BE OF SOME USE To YOU.

I DON'T KNOW JUST HHAT THE LOCAL CHAPTER OF THE HUMAINE SOCIETY WILL DO.
I ASKED MRS. WALLEY ABOUT THE SUPPORT OF THAT GROUP AND SEE WAS SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL--
:I DON'T KNow WHETHER I TOLD YOU OR NOT. BUT THE SOCIETY TS TRYING TO COLLECT
SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO BUILD A NEW SHELTER HERE IN AUSTIN. UHICH IS BADLY NEEDED, AND
RIGHT AT THE MOMENT IT TAKES PRECIDENT OVER EVERYTHING ELSE. HOWEVER, I WILL TRY

To CONTACT THE PRESIDENT AND SEE IF I CAN GET THE LOCAL ORGINIZATION TO SEND A LETTER
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

OUR CAT CLUB IS GETTING READY TO HAVE A KITTEN_SHOR,-AS SOON AS WE GET
THE IGO AHEADI FROM THE C.F.A. WE REE TRYING TOPROMOTE INTEREST AND CARE OF CATS,
BETTER FEEDING, BETTER HOMES AND MORE SELECTIVE BREEDING THAT WE HOPE IN THE FUTURE
WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO ALL CATS. IT IS THE VERY FIRSTVENTUREOF ITS KIND HERE IN
tAUSTIN AND WE ARE MOST ANXIOUS THAT IT BE A SUCCESS.

SUMMER HAD CERTAINLY COME HITH A BANG TO THIS PARTOF THE COUNTRY AND-
T HE ARE COZILY COOKING IN 96-100 DEGREE TEMPATURES. IN THE MEAN TIME WE ARE TRYING
1T0 KEEP OURGRASS FROM BEING BURNED TO A CRISP SO WE HAVE TO HATER ALL OF THE TIME.

I AM SO GLAD THAT CHRISTINE LIKED THE DOG AND CAT STORY. I wILL SEE IF
TTHE MEMBERS OF THE CLUB HAVE ANY MORE STORIES OF COOPERATION BETHEEN ANIMALs; WE HAVE
'ZS£VERAL MEMBERS THAT LIVE ON FARMS AND I'M SURE THAT THEYTMUST HAVE SOME INTERSTING

Dear Mr. Breit:

I had expected that by this time I would
have an opportunity to contact you in regard to your
very nice letter of August 27.

I have been out of town a great deal of the
time in connection with the Remington Humane Stunner,
and it appears that this will continue for several
months. However, you can feel sure that I will contact
you at the first Opportunity.

Very truly yours,

Dear Christine:

Thank you very much for your letter of August 27, 1956. We have sent
our material on humane slaughter to all possible packers, producers
and everyone else who is interested, including newspapers.

I am sure you realize that, while the packers generally are favorable

to humane slaughter, they are not going to come out in favor of a law
which says the;r themselves have to be forced into doing something.

The cooperative committee of the AHA and AMI is solely for the purpose
of developing and testing humane slaughtering methods. Both sides of
the committee realize that when we come to the point of legislation we
are not going to say that voluntary acceptance is enough. By the same
code the packers are not going to say that compulsory legislation is
necessary to force them to do something that they should do. I am sure
that all those who testified at the hearing for the packers gave testimony
in opposition to compulsory legislation because they felt it was to their
best interest to do so. I did advise the Federation of Women's Clubs of
the position of the American Humane Association. I also sent all of

the material to packers, producers, livestock interest, newspapers and
trade papers.

It is unfortunate in this effort that we cannct always contra! the writings
of all the people who are influenced on our side or on’tha opposition side.
This is one of the problems that we have always faced in this field.
