Artist's drawing of future home of AVMA in Schaumburg, III. In a slide presentation
to the House of Delegates, July 15, Dr. D. A. Price, AVMA executive vice president,
showed the groundbreaking ceremony, July 6, and various building materials being
considered for the structure. "Our hope is," said Dr. Price, ”that the new AVMA
headquarters will be one of the best-looking buildings in the business section of
Schaumburg, which it is predicted will be the second largest business community in
Illinois in a few years." Dr. Spangler, AVMA treasurer, reported that the goal of having
the building paid for by the time it is occupied (target date, May 31, 1974), appears

attainable at the present time.

House Adopts Resolution
Strongly Opposing
Wild Animals as Pets

A firmly worded resolution oppos-
ing the keeping of wild and exotic
animals as pets was adopted by the
AVMA House of Delegates in the closing
session of its 110th annual meeting, July
15, in Philadelphia. The resolution, pre-
sented by the Association’s Council on
Public Health and Regulatory Veterinary
Medicine, and by the Council on Veter-
inary Service, reads:

“The AVMA strongly opposes the
keeping of wild and exotic species of
animals as pets and believes that all
commercial trafﬁc of these animals for
such purpose should be prohibited.”

Two urgent reasons the councils
offered in support of the resolution are
that exotic species, which people like to
possess because they are unusual or re-
garded as status symbols, create disease,
diet, and exercise problems different
from those of domesticated pets. They
also pose a difﬁcult problem, even a
traumatic experience, when they must be
disposed of. Frequently zoos will not

accept them, and they are “too domesti-
cated” to return to the wild. Euthanasia
may then be the only alternative. Veter-
inarians should exert their inﬂuence to
discourage the keeping of wild or exotic
species as pets, the councils urged.

lnterFational Radiologists
To Meet in Washington, D.C.

The Third International Conference of
Veterinary Radiology will be held in
Washington, D.C., September 5—8, at the
Twin Bridges Marriott Hotel. This con-
ference is sponsored by the International
Veterinary Radiology Association and is
being hosted in the United States by the
American Veterinary Radiology Society.

Radiographic diagnosis, radiation
thera y, and pertinent related research
are t e program topics. It is designed to
appeal to both small and large animal
practitioners as well as radiologists. The
conference is arranged as a continuing
forum for the discussion of veterinary
radiology on an international level.

The hosts, the AVRS, have arranged
for a cocktail party and an evening at
Kennedy Center while in Washington. A

Reference Committees Help

Write AVMA History

Year by year AVMA’s history is
written in the transactions of the House
of Delegates, meeting for two days pre-
ceding the annual AVMA convention.
Were it not for the work of the seven
House reference committees, however,
the 124—member House of Delegates
would ﬁnd it impossible to carry out its
task as efﬁciently and effectively as it
customarily does.

Pictured on these pages are the 1973
reference committees working at their
assignments on Saturday afternoon and
evening, July 14. By 9:30 a.m. Sunday,
July 15, when President-Elect John
Quinn called the House to order for the
second session of the 110th annual meet-

Mrs. Monahan Installed as
Auxiliary President

Installed as president of the Women’s
Auxiliary to the AVMA, Monday after-
noon, July 16, in the Bellevue Stratford
Hotel, was Mrs. Robert R. Monahan,
Brunswick, Maine, who has served as
president-elect during the past year. She
succeeds Mrs. William I. Sippel, Bryan,
Texas.

 

Mrs. Robert Monahan

Mrs. Monahan has been active in veter—
inary auxiliary work on state, regional,
and national levels for a number of years.
Before her election last year as president-
elect, she served as treasurer of the
Auxiliary. She is past president and
secretary of the Women’s Auxiliary to the
Maine V.M.A. and has served as ofﬁcial
hostess of the New En land V.M.A. In
1968, she was elected to ier first ofﬁce in
the Auxiliary to the AVMA, becoming
parliamentarian. In succeeding years, she
was elected secretary, vice president of
membership promotion, and treasurer.

Community activities have also
occupied Mrs. Monahan’s time and
talents. Currently immediate past-
president of the Brunswick Altrusa Club,
a woman’s service club, she has also
served as president of the Women’s Club
of the St. Charles Barromeo Parish, of

which she is a member, and as a board
member of the Brunswick Chapter of the
American Red Cross.

The new president describes herself as
“a former registered nurse who trans-
ferred her clinical and operating room
experience from man to pets upon marry-
ing a veterinarian.” She has been active in
her husband’s practice for the past 25
years. The Monahans have one son, Mr.

Veterinarian Sculptor’s Art

 

Featured at Fort Dodge Exhibit

Art of the Old West by a sculptor of
the Far West, who is also a veterinarian,
is featured amon AVMA convention
exhibits at the Ph' adelphia Civic Center
this week. In the Fort Dodge Labora-
tories exhibit, Booths 618 and 619, will
be seen the work of Dr. Kirk Seekins
(WSU ’62), who practiced at Belgrade,
Mont., before devoting his full time and
talents to sculpture.

Dr. Seekins’ bronze groups, remi-
niscent of Frederic Remington, are
highly authentic and reflect the rugged
action, mood, and feeling of the early
Western frontier, as well as more con-
temporary ranch life.

As a former large animal practitioner,
Dr. Seekins is familiar with the anatomy
of the horses, longhorn cattle, buffalo,
and other animals he sculpts. But
further, as a former cowpuncher, horse
breeder and trainer, he knows and con-
veys with firsthand realism the spirit of
a bucking bronco, steer roping, and the
buffalo chase.

While Dr. Seekins has had many
exhibitions of his work, this Philadelphia
showing is the first time he has ex-
hibited outside his native West. Besides
creating the models, he also makes his
own molds, casts the pieces in the
foundry, and ﬁnally finishes the bronze
sculptures himself.

For many years, Dr. Seekins main-

tained a high interest in art, but because

of other pursuits did not have time to

develop this interest. However, after sell-

ing his veterinary practice in Belgrade, a
few years ago, his interest in art re-
kindled, and it was then that he first
began sculpting.

His work has been widely acclaimed

by Western art critics and connoisseurs
in the Northwest and Midwest. Now, for

the first time, his work is being shown

in the East, through the courtesy of

Fort Dodge Laboratories, for viewing by

his peers at a nationwide meeting.

 

Famous Attractions
Around Philadelphia

Now is your chance to Visit or revisit
some of Pennsylvania’s perennial attrac-
tions, located in the environs of Philadel—
phia. Gettysburg, one of America’s
greatest historical sites, is only about a
2-hour drive from Philadelphia. The
famous Civil War battlefield, now a
national cemetery, appears today very
much as it did in 1863. Many of the can-
nons have been restored and placed
throughout the park area. One of the
restored cannon units is Battery D, 5th
US. Artillery, the unit commanded by
Alexander Hamilton in the Revolutionary
War. It also served honorably at Gettys-
burg’s Little Roundtop.

Pennsylvania Dutch Country

Also only a short drive from Phila—
delphia is the lush and prosperous
Pennsylvania Dutch farm country. A
picturesque community is Lancaster,
which recalls quieter times and a more
relaxed era. Covered bridges and horse
carts abound in this area, and the hand-
craft shops and demonstrations of spin—
ning, weaving, and other homecrafts, will
delight every member of the family.

Railroad buffs will want to ride on the
Strasburg Railroad, a steam—powered ex-
cursion train. Families with children will
want to visit the Dutch Wonderland
Amusement Park. In Wheatland, Presi-
dent Buchanan’s home is open to the

public.

Famous Longwood Gardens

Only 25 miles from Philadelphia are
the famous Longwood Gardens on the
estate of the late Pierre S. du Pont near
Kennett Square, Pa., Where the New
Bolton Center of the University of
Pennsylvania, is located. The gardens are
open to the public every day of the year.
Outdoor gardens are open from 8:00 a.m.

to sunset, and the conservatories are open
from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.

Du Pont Winterthur Museum

Near Wilmington, Del., also about 25
miles from Philadelphia, is the Henry
Francis du Pont Winterthur Museum. In
its more than 1,000 rooms are displayed

American domestic architecture, furni—
ture, ceramics, metalwork, folk art,
textiles, paintings, and prints of the 200
years from 1640 to 1840. Advance reser-
vations are required for the main
museum, but ten rooms in the South

Drop by and let us know if there’s
any way we can assist you.

As a veterinary practitioner one frequently ﬁnds himself
in the role of nutritionist.

Whether it’s in response to a new pet owner asking
“What should I feed him?”, or the result of diagnosing
clinical signs of nutritional deﬁciency —— keeping abreast
of the latest research and development concerning animal
nutrition is an important part of your practice.

While Champion Valley Farms is quite new to the ﬁeld of
animal nutrition, we bring with us a considerable
knowledge of food science, dietary studies, and advanced
quality production control systems through our parent
organization, the Campbell Soup Company.

While we’d like the chance to acquaint you with our
efforts toward developing highly acceptable nutritionally
adequate products, we’d like even more impermmly, the
opportunity to meet you in person, and get a better feeling
as to how we might best serve the needs of your practice
through product development and consumer education
over the coming years.

 

We hope that you’ll be able to set aside at least a little of
your time during the AVMA Convention and meet some
of the people behind our Recipe brand pet products.

We’ll be at booth 807-808-809.

 

See you there!

“We believe that exem'a, the spirit of hospitality of the
Greeks, world famous since ancient times, and the classic

House Upholds 5-Year Terms
for Council Members

The House of Delegates on July 15 overwhelmingly
defeated six proposed constitutional amendments which
would reduce the terms of members in AVMA’s six councils
from 5 to 4 years. Proponents of the amendments said the
proposed constitutional change would help spread the
leadership in AVMA around. Opponents felt that shorter
council terms would reduce the quality and stability of
leadership in AVMA. About 2 years are required for a new
member to become adequately familiar with the work of a
council, they said.

The House also defeated a proposal which would replace
two members of the Council on Public Health and
Regulatory Veterinary Medicine associated with public
health and regulatory agencies with a small animal
practitioner and a large animal practitioner. The proposal
was decided by the only roll call vote in this year’s session.

Other Amendments

Of the 15 proposed amendments considered by the
House of Delegates, July 15, seven were adopted. Among
them:

0 The president and secretary of the National
Conference of Student Chapters of the AVMA were
designated ex officio members of the House of Delegates,
without the right to vote.

0 The term “Student Chapters” was changed to
“Student Organizations” and the National Conference of
Student Chapters of the AVMA recognized as a veterinary
group and granted afﬁliation with AVMA.

0 The name of the National Conference of Student
Chapters of the AVMA was changed to Student American
Veterinary Medical Association.

0 Amendments to the Constitution will be filed
hereafter with the executive vice president instead of the
president of AVMA at least 10 days instead of 5 days prior
to the beginning of each annual meeting.

0 The Executive Board may hold its first meeting in any
day of the annual meeting following the ﬁnal sessions of
the House of Delegates.

0 The Council on Education was given the added
responsibility of establishing and applying criteria for the
approval of animal technicians training programs.

Redistricting Board

An amendment proposing to reorganize the Executive
Board through redistricting certain states evoked a spirited
discussion in the House. The amendment, which would
have reduced the number of districts from 10 to 11, was
ﬁnally sent back to the Executive Board for further study.

Inaugural Luncheon (Cont’d from page 3)

to help alert pet owners and others to the
problem of unwanted dogs and cats. The
message that surgical sterilization,
although the best means of birth control
for pet animals at the moment, is not the
ultimate answer will be told through such

mediums as a television spot
announcement, slide set, poster, and
brochure, prepared by the AVMA

Division of Public Information.

0 Passage by the House of Delegates,
July 15, of a resolution strongly
discouraging the keeping of wild or exotic
pets and urging a ban on all commercial
traffic in these animals as pets.

0 Acquisition of land for a
headquarters building for the Association
in Schaumburg, 111., one of the fastest
growing areas in that part of the country;
and the breaking of ground for the
building on July 6.

Dr. Link concluded his address by
showing several color slides of the
groundbreaking ceremony. “We hope to
begin construction next month,” he said,
“and to move into a completed facility in
May of 1974. When we do move in, we’ll
have the almost unprecedented
distinction of having our building
completely paid for.”

 

Honorary Member (Cont'd from page 1)

been a strong advocate of programs
to advance veterinary medicine. As the
Surgeon General, U.S. Army, Lieu-
tenant General Jennings has actively
supported 'the members and missions of
the Army Veterinary Service. His
foresight and personal endeavors have
contributed immeasurably to the
ever-expanding participation of veter-
inary medicine in the military health
care programs. He has repeatedly
emphasized that veterinarians are an
invaluable resource which must be
encouraged and utilized in the ex—
panding role of the military health care
team.

As a result, he has promoted the utili-
zation of veterinarians in positions of
high responsibility and has taken steps to
ensure that military veterinarians are
afforded appropriate training to function
in these areas. He believes that veteri-
narians, together with physicians and
dentists, are the principal primary mem-
bers of the total health care delivery
team. This is revealed in the Surgeon
General’s realignment of medical re-
sources, integrating military public health
veterinarians into the preventive medicine
team.

The expertise of public health veter-
inarians is now being utilized in positions
heretofore occupied only by military
physicians. General Jennings gave un-
limited support to Army veterinarians

6

assisting in the control of the viscero-
tropic velogenic Newcastle disease and
Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis
epizootics. He has authorized the es-
tablishment of a liaison Veterinary Corps
officer position with the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, thereby enhancing the
communication and cooperation between
these agencies in the development of
plans and programs for control of exotic
animal diseases.

Recognizing the continuous contribu-
tions that veterinarians make to the total
military health system, he approved the
faculty liaison concept in which in—
terested members from the faculties of
each of the U.S. colleges of veterinary
medicine have been appointed to serve as
veterinary faculty liaison representatives
to the Surgeon General.

The most signiﬁcant contribution
General Jennings has made for military
veterinarians is the establishment of a
position at the command level in the
recently established Health Services Com-
mand, thereby bringing greater recogni—
tion and responsibility to the military
veterinarian.

 

Dr. Quinn (Cont'd from page 1)

first standin committee on animal wel—
fare, whose unction is to develop model
laws for state and federal legislatures in
regulating proper treatment of animals.

In 1967-1968, Dr. Quinn also served as
president of the Michigan V.M.A. An
active member of AVMA, he served also
in 1965 as an officer of the AVMA
section on regulatory veterinary medi-
cine. The same year he was elected to the
AVMA Executive Board and served as
chairman in 1969. In this position, he
also served as chairman of the AVMA
Board of Governors.

Dr. Quinn’s leadership and contribu-
tions to veterinary medicine have been
recognized by various organizations. The
Animal Welfare Institute awarded him its
coveted Albert Schweitzer Medal in 1968.
In 1970, the Michigan V.M.A., in a
unanimous vote, chose him for its highest
award, the Michigan V.M.A. Service
Award. In 1971, the MSU Colle e of
Veterinary Medicine selected him For its
Alumni Award.

In his position as president of AVMA,
Dr. Quinn will also serve on the Executive
Board and the Board of Governors.

to the advancement of the veterinary
profession, is a small animal practitioner
in Miami, Fla. He was in private practice
with his father until 1941, when he en-
tered the U.S. Army Air Force and served
until 1946.

Dr. Knowles’ contributions to the
advancement of the veterinary profession
are numerous. A member of the AVMA
House of Delegates for 8 years, he served
as chairman of the House Advisory Com-
mittee for one term. He has served on the
AVMA Council on Veterinary Services
and is currently a member of the Council
on Biological and Therapeutic Agents.
While a member of the AVMA Executive
Board, he served as its chairman for two
terms. In 1963-1964, he was elected
president of AVMA.

Honors received by Dr. Knowles in-
clude the Florida V.M.A. “Veterinarian
of the Year” award in 1960, the Cuban
Veterinarians in Exile Award in 1963, the

Practitioner Research Award

Dr. Pollock received the 1973 Prac—
titioner Research Award, consisting of a
plaque, in recognition of his outstanding
research activities conducted while in
practice. A small animal practitioner, he
is also director of the Newark Beth Israel
Medical Center, Animal Facilities. Since

8

1962, he has also served as veterinary
consultant to the center.

Among his numerous research proj-

, ects, he served on the surgical team for

renal homotransplantation on dogs with
the surgeons of the hospital prior to their
first transplantation in the human being.
The work was documented in a series of
pictures that won the Special Research
Award in Clinical Photography, spon—
sored by the journal VM/SAC in Febru—
ary, 1969.

Currently, he is assisting in cardiac
surgery involving the measurement of
flow studies of the aorta and coronary
arteries when the inferior vena cava is
compressed. Another study, in progress
over the past 5 years and soon to be pub-
lished, is on basic research of autogenous
collagen vascular tubes implanted in the
dog for a period of 5 weeks and then
utilized as blood vessels. The results of his
research have been published in leading
veterinary journals.

12th International
Veterinary Congress Prize

Dr. Moore, who has devoted one third
of his professional career to work in un-
derdeveloped areas in India and Africa,
was the recipient of this year’s 12th Inter—
national Veterinary Congress Prize. The
award, consisting of a plaque and a cash
stipend, was in recognition of his out—
standing contributions to veterinary
medical science and the veterinary profes-
Slon.

For the first 26 years of his profession-
al career, Dr. Mo‘ore was engaged in

  
      

Dr. Marvin J. Twiehaus

‘ 3' Aﬁ/J 4’"

Dr. E. E. Saulm

teaching, research, and extension work at
West Virginia University, the University
of Delaware, Cornell University, and Ohio
State University. While at Cornell his re-
search in diseases of poultry led him to be
the first to isolate and identify 3 new
species of coccidia of turkeys. In 1955,
he was awarded the National Turkey
Research Award.

Following this work, he assisted in
increasing animal protein production in
India by setting up demonstration
poultry and dairy goat units under a
program supported by the Ford Founda—
tion. Remaining in India after this 3-year
assignment, he was veterinary medical
advisor to the Tirupathi Veterinary
College and Hyderabad Veterinary
College as part of a USAID/KSU India
program.

Dr. Moore followed his 12 years’ work
in India with 2 years as professor on the
faculty of the Ahmadu Bello University,
Samuri, Nigeria. In addition to teaching
and consultation work, he developed a
modern poultry farm at the university
and initiated research pertaining to
coccidiosis in the guinea fowl. At the
completion of his work at Bello Uni-
versity in 1971, Dr. Moore retired.

He is the author or co-author of 40
scientific papers. Several deal with agri-
culture in India. Professional organiza-
tions of which he is a member include the
American Association of Avian Patholo-
gy, Ohio V.M.A., Pennsylvania V.M.A.,
and AVMA.

Public Service Award

In recognition of his outstanding con—
tributions in public health and regulatory
veterinary medicine, Dr. Saulmon re—
ceived the 1973 Public Service Award,

 




 

consisting of a plaque. He is deputy
administrator of Veterinary Services for
USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service.

Dr. Saulmon began his career in regu-

latory veterinary medicine in 1935, when i

he was assigned to the Kentucky ﬁeld
force of the Bureau of Animal Industry.
In 1947, he was transferred to Mexico,
where he served in progressively responsi-
ble positions. In 1956, he joined the
Washington, D.C., staff as assistant to the
director of the Animal Disease Eradica-
tion Division, and in 1965, he was
appointed deputy director of Science and
Education for USDA. He returned to the
Animal Health Division as director in
1967 and was reassigned in 1970 as
deputy administrator for Veterinary
Services, Agricultural Research Service.
When the regulatory functions of ARS
were removed and the Animal and Plant

on the AVMA program (research) and
presented the first paper to be published
in a technical journal in the United States
incriminating Clostridium perfringens
Type D as the cause of enterotoxemia of

‘sheep. In 1944, he reported the develop-

ment and use of alum precipitated
toxoid, which has become so important
for protection against that disease. More
recently Dr. Muth’s work with selenium
in white muscle' disease of lambs and
calves has received international recogni—
tion. Some of his other contributions
relate to salmon poisoning in dogs,
brucellosis, and Lactobacillus acidophilus
in the treatment of enteric diseases of
lambs and calves.

Active in AVMA since 1929, Dr. Muth
has been a member of the Council on
Research for the past 10 years, serving as
chairman in 1969. He was a delegate to

Third Year for Dr. Jackson
as AVMA Foundation
Seminar Planner

Seminars have become an important
part of AVMA convention programs since
their inception in 1971, at the Detroit
convention. In 1972, the number attend-
ing increased by 30%, reflecting the ex—
cellent selection of topics and speakers by
Dr. William F, Jackson (MSU ’47), Lake-
land, Fla.

When the AVMA Foundation decided
to sponsor the seminars, its directors
quickly singled out Dr. Jackson as one of
the most knowledgeable and effective
seminar planners, largely on the basis of
his role as seminar planner for the Ameri-
can Animal Hospital Association. Results
have proved the wisdom of their decision.

Dr. Jackson, a tireless worker for both
AAHA and AVMA, was attracted to the
responsibility of seminar planning be—
cause he believed it offered him an
opportunity to contribute personally to
his profession and to help the AVMA
Foundation raise funds for worthwhile
veterinary medical projects. All funds
collected from fees of those attending
seminars in excess of funds needed to

support the seminars go to the general
fund of the AVMA Foundation.

Over the course of its history, the
Foundation has supplied funds for veteri-
nary student scholarships, graduate
student fellowships, and more recently
support for veterinary medical research
projects aimed at solving clinical prob-
lems.

Dr. Jackson, in addition to his activi-
ties as a private practitioner and as the
“planning committee” for the AVMA
Foundation seminars, serves as editor of
the Journal of the American Animal
Hospital Association, official journal of
the AAHA, and as a member of AVMA’s
Council on Education. He has agreed to
serve again as seminar planner for the
1974 AVMA convention.

 

Physiologists Honored
by ASVPP

Two veterinary physiologists of inter-
national reputation, Drs. H. H. Dukes and
R. W. Dougherty, have been named
Distinguished Physiologists by the
American Society of Veterinary Physiol-
ogists and Pharmacologists. Dr. M. C.
Morrissette, president of the ASVPP,
presented the honors bestowed for great
contributions to veterinary medical
education and research. The resentation
was made at a dinner at the ome of Dr.
and Mrs. L. L. Nangeroni, Ithaca, N.Y.,
where over a hundred friends and
members attended. Drs. Dukes and
Dougherty each received, in memory of
the occasion, a mounted engraved silver
Paul Revere bowl.

 

Speakers . . .

 

If there's one thing that characterizes a convention more than any other, it is
probably speakers. Speakers on all subjects (or sometimes even on no sub-
jecti—some inspired—some funny—some bored—and some just trying awfully hard
to make a point. This is a composite of some of Monday's speakers at various
functions and on various subjects or nonsubjects.

The top wor mer, in a
survey of horsemen,W111 be
no surprise to you.

It shouldn’t be. Because every dose came from you
or other veterinarians. And every year, horse-own-
ers have been coming back to you for more. When
an anthelmintic keeps growing more popular for
8 years—you know it performs and performs well
—with high safety and efﬁcacy. Horse-owners know
it, too. As the national survey by a leading horse
registry shows.

There’s plenty of evidence that horsemen are on
sound ground, in choosing Dyrex (trichlorfon). It
controls a high percentage of all 5 major internal
parasites. Not just this parasite or that one. All 5.
Its record of safety is an 8-year record. Not just a
year or so. And on millions of horses. Not a
sprinkling few.

Three forms of Dyrex—Tube Formula, Cap-
Tabs®, and Granules—meet every need, for single
treatment or an efﬁcient year-round program. All
with utmost convenience—no fasting, no withhold-
ing water, no intricate measuring, no “extras” to add.
You can rely on Dyrex. And it’s exclusively yours.

Dosage: Dyrex Tube Formula, Granules, and Cap-Tabs
are packaged in individual dosages conforming to body-
weights of 200 1b., 500 1b., and 1000 lb. Combine sizes for
other bodyweights.

Cautions and side effects: Symptoms of over-dosage are
colic, diarrhea, and incoordination, appearing in l to 3
hours. Usually pass quickly. If antidote needed,
use atropine (10 mg./50 lb. to 100 lb. body-
weight). Worming mares in late pregnancy not
recommended. Avoid surgery, severe stress, use
of succinylcholine or spraying horses with
organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides
within 1 week before or after treatment. Do not
administer to sick horses. Not to be consumed by
other species. Federal law restricts this drug to
use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.

Ipecac as an Emetic in the Cat

 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
    
  
 
  
   
  
   
   
  
  
   
   
  
  
 

January 10, 1973
Dear Sir:

As each month passes I become more convinced of
the variety of the maxim, “Those who ignore history are
doomed to repeat it.” Five years ago a veterinary publi-
cation carried a “Clinical News” report of a practitioner’s
discovery that boric acid powder was more ell'ective than
were topical antibiotics in the treatment of canine otitis
externa. Dr. Alexander Glass recommended horic acid
for this purpose in his book, Diseases of the Dog, pub-
lished in 1896 and in his lectures through the early
1930’s.

“Syrup of Ipecac as an Emetic in the Cat,” by R. A.
Yeary (J.A.V.M.A., Dec. 15, 1972), seems to conﬁrm
extant knowledge. Ipecac, a Brazilian drug, was intro-
duced into EurOpean medicine in 1686 when Louis XIV
purchased a secret nostrum for the treatment of diarrhea
from a quack named Helvetius.

As additional bibliographic support for the paper
published, speciﬁcally related to the use of ipecac as an
emetic in cats, permit me to offer:

1) Veterinarian’s Handbook of Materia Medica and
Therapeutics, by D. H. Udall, 2nd ed., Macmillan Com-
pany, New York (1922): 55;

2) Veterinary Pharmacology, Materia Medica and
Therapeutics, by H. J. Milks, 2nd ed, Alexander Eger,

3) Dispensatory of the United States of America,

Philadelphia. Vol. I. Part III, (1955): 1987; and

4) Immodestly, perhaps, because I had a hand in
each, Remington’s Practice of Pharmacy, by E. W. Mar-
tin, et at. 11th ed. (1956): 926; and 12th ed. (1961):
812, and its successor, Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sci-
ences, 13th ed. (1965): 947 and 14th ed. (1970): 871,
Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa.

The signiﬁcant pharmacotherapeutic ﬁnding in Dr.

the active ingredients seems critical to the emetic re-

dilution of ipecac syrup doubled
the latent period. Further elaboration of this point
mlght have been enlightening.

example of this is the dosage for aspirin in cats found
in Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, 13, (1965):
1195, and elsewhere. For an analysis of the dosage er-
ror, see J.A.V.M.A., 153, (Nov. 1, 1968): 1161—1167.

The report (J.A.V.M.A., Dec. 15, 1972) recognized
the common knowledge that ipecac has emetic proper—
ties and simply established from experimentation a
basis for its dosage in cats.

The most singular error in veterinary therapeutics
is the free extrapolation of dosage from one species to
another based on guidelines such as those found in Vet-

erinary Pharmacology, Materia Medica and Therapeu- ,

tics by H. J. Milks, 6th ed., Alexander Eger, Chicago
(1949): 75, which historically was the basis for estab-
lishing drug dosage and was done without controlled
studies to conﬁrm if such extrapolations were valid.
Citing numerous references that repeat the same error
or unsubstantiated basis for dosage does not improve
the reliability of the printed word nor contribute to a
better understanding of veterinary therapeutics and in
particular the problem of drug dosage in the cat.

Dear Sir:

I just read with interest your note on<Fage 1642-7

of the December 15 issue in which you re er to the
induction of Dr. Barbara Smith as preside t of the
New Zealand Veterinary Association. In you note you
state you believe that she is the ﬁrst woman V terinarian
to serve as president of a national veterinary ssociation.
I would like to correct this assumptiory since Miss
W. Mary Brancker was the ﬁrst woma president of
the British Veterinary Association a, she held ofﬁce
from 1967 to 1968. i

[EDITOR‘S/NOTE: Actually, it was not any one on the
AVMApublications staff who thought Dr. Smith was the
ﬁrst woman president. That was the New Zealanders’
belief. The AVMA had a woman as an “ofﬁcer” in 1937
for the ﬁrst time when Dr. Helen Irwin served as secre-
tary.) to the Section on Small Animals]

Brief Summary

FLUOTHANE®
BRAND OF HALOTHANE
NON-FLAMMABLE, NON-EXPLOSIVE
INHALATION ANESTHETIC
CAUTIONS: Fluothane should not be used in patients in shock,
in those with minimal cardiac reserve, and in those With grossly
disturbed cardiac rhythm. Its high potency makes precise
control of administration mandatory. Fluothane is_incompatible
with epinephrine-like compounds and d-tubocurarine. It is also
incompatible with succinylcholine chloride in all speCIes except
horses.
Certain drugs including some broad spectrum antibiotics-and
the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are cholines-
terase inhibitors. Do not use succinylcholine chloride during
treatment or within 14-21 days following treatment With these
drugs.
ADMINISTRATION: Fluothane is twice as potent as chloroform,
and four times as potent as ether.
Therefore, Fluothane should be used with vaporizers that prowde
accurate concentrations which can be altered in percentage
fractions over the entire clinical range of 0.5 to 4.0 per cent
(v/v).
Concentrations of 1.5 to 2.5 per cent Fluothane are required for
induction of anesthesia, whereas maintenance requuements
vary between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent in the inhaled atmosphere.
Whichever apparatus is used, IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY
THAT THE VAPORIZER BE PLACED BETWEEN THE GAS SUPPLY
AND THE BREATHING BAG. IF BETWEEN THE BAG AND THE
PATIENT OVERDOSAGE MAY RESULT.
Induction should not be hurried, and the concentration of vapor
should not he suddenly increased.
In horses, where endotracheal intubation is desired, the intuba-
tion may be accomplished by using an anesthetic dose of one
of the short acting barbiturates and/or succinylcholine chloride.
In other species, succinylcholine chloride should NOT be used
for endotracheal intubation. However, short acting barbiturates
may be used.
SUPPLIED: No. 5125—Unit packages of 125 cc. of hanthane
stabilized with 0.01 per cent thymol (w/w).

TRANVET® INJECTABLE SOLUTION

1(propiopromazine hydrochloride)
For veterinary use only
For intravenous or intramuscular use

INDICATIONS: Tranvet® (propiopromazine hydrochloride) is indicated in
clinical circumstances which require the aid of a tranquilizer or preanes-
thetic and those situations where reduction in the amount of general anes-
thesia is desirable. It is an effective aid in the handling of difficult, excited
and unruly animals. Use as indicated prior to routine examinations, labora-
tory and diagnostic procedures, and in minor surgery, with or without general
anesthetic. This tranquilizer is also indicated in major surgery as a preanes-
thetic agent, given at least 10 minutes prior to the administration of a general
anesthetic. Under these circumstances it may be used to advantage in two
ways. First, it potentiates the action of barbiturate and hypnotic-like com—
pounds and therefore, may be used to effectively reduce the amount of such
agents usually required to effect desirable anesthesia. On the other hand
when followed in 10 to 20 minutes by the usually required amount of general
anesthetic, the result is a markedly prolonged duration of such anesthesia.
I With adjunctive Tranvet ® (propiopromazine hydrochloride) pretreatment,
it is less difficult to: groom, clean teeth, clip hair and nails; to treat and dress
wounds, lesions, and skin abrasions; to apply splints, bandages, and remove
sutures; to remove cutaneous warts, cysts, and tumors; to examine and medi-
cate eyes; to relieve tendinitis; to administer tetanus therapy and to ad-
minister oral anthelmintics. I Cauterization and other minor surgical or
laboratory procedures are facilitated, including urological procedures, ca—
therization, rectal palpation, examination of genitalia, and radiography.
I This agent is also useful as a preanesthetic in patients requiring surgery,
including: castration, caesarian section, hysterectomy, replacement of
vaginal and rectal prolapses and removal of urinary calculi.

RECOMMENDED DOSE — DOGS AND CATS: Tranquilization: 0.05—0.5 mg./
lb.; |.V. or I.M. I Preanesthetic: 0.25 mg./lb.; l.V. I A small bore syringe
such as a tuberculin syringe should be used in smaller breeds.

PRECAUTION: Like all tranquilizers, response will vary from animal to ani-
mal. For this reason, intravenous injections should be given slowly using
a minimum of restraint. I Obese and older dogs generally require a smaller
dose per pound of body weight than younger, underweight, or nervous ani-
mals. Animals that have been severely stressed should be treated cautiously.
I Allow at least 20-40 minutes to permit Tranvet® (propiopromazine hydro-
chloride) to take full effect. Do not give additional drug during this period.
I When administered over extended periods, it is advisable to follow the
blood picture. While no blood dyscrasias have been reported in animals
treated with this product, they have been reported to follow the use of other
drugs of the phenothiazine class. I Do not use this product in conjunction

with organophosphates and/or procaine hydrochloride since phenothiazines
may potentiate the toxicity of organophosphates and. the actIVity of procaine
hydrochloride. I 1. Tranquilizers should be administered in smaller doses
and with greater care when the animals are exhausted, debilitated, old, obese,
overheated or under conditions of extreme heat or cold or show signs of
cardiac disease, sympathetic blockade, hypovolemia, or shock. A greater
care should also be taken during general anesthesia. I 2. This drug should
not be used in conjunction with hypnotics such as chloralose; or, with other
phenothiazine derivatives. I 3. Tranquilizers are potent central nervous
system depressants and can cause marked sedation With suppression of the
sympathetic nervous system. I 4. HypotenSIon can occur alter rapid intra—
venous injection causing cardiovascular collapse. I 5. In case of acute hypo-
tension caused by phenothiazine-derivative tranquilizers,‘pressor amines
such as norepinephrine or phenylephrine are the drugs ol choice. Epine-
phrine is contraindicated since further depression of blood pressure can
occur. I 6. Tranquilizers can produce prolonged depression or motor rest-
lessness when given in excessive amounts or when given to sensitive animals.
I 7. Tranquilizers are additive in action to the actions of other depressants,
and will potentiate general anesthesia. I 8. Store at room ierriperature.
I 9. Protect from light.

ANTIDOTE: Adverse reactions in hypersensitive animals have occasionally
been reported. The patient should be closely observed so prompt treatment
may be given if necessary. I In common with the phenothiazine tranquil-
izers, no specific antidote for Tranvet® (propiopromazine hydrochloride)
exists. In general, supportive treatment is helpful. I In cases of lowered blood
pressure, norepinephrine should be used. Epinephrine should not be used
under any circumstances. I When respiratory depression occurs, caffeine
or Ritalin (Ciba) are the drugs of choice.

CAUTION: Federal (U.S.A.) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order
of a licensed veterinarian.

quent investigations including Schirmer Tear Tests,
conjunctiva] scrapings, histopathologic and electron mi-
croscopic studies have indicated that phenazopyridine
HCl alone is capable of producing severe lesions in the
lacrimal and nictitans glands and the glands of Zeis and
Moll, with consequent keratoconjunctivitis sicca.1 N0
breed or sex eﬂect was apparent. The toxicity of various
sulfonamides except sulfamethizole was not investigated.
In preliminary trials phenazopyridine HCl appeared to
be more important than sulfamethizole in decreasing
tear ﬂow.

On the basis of our own findings,1 Dr. Aguirre’s ob-
servations3 and other information,2 it would appear that
phenazopyridine HCl alone or in combination with any
of the sulfonamides is particularly likely to cause kera-
toconjunctivitis sicca in the dog. Further controlled in-

vestigations on the effect of sulfonamides on canine tear
secretion are necessary.

NEWS FROM
WASHINGTON . . . .

 

 

Health

H.R. 59, introduced by Rep. Sullivan (D., Mo.),
would protect the public health by regulating or pro-
hibiting the transportation, sale, or other distribution
in interstate commerce of live creatures intended to be
offered as household pets. It particularly would protect
children from unreasonable exposure to serious diseases
carried by infected animals whether warm-blooded or
cold—blooded—birds, ﬁsh, reptiles, and other creatures.

H.R. 1235, introduced by Rep. Sullivan (D., Mo.),
is a very inclusive bill pro-posed to protect the Public
Health Bill amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cos-
metic Act to amend certain labeling provisions, provide
adequate information for consumers, including caution-
ary labeling for articles where needed to prevent acci-
dental injury. It would expand the coverage of the
“Delaney Clause” to apply to mutagenic and teratogenic
agents; it also would include dietary foods, medical de-
vices, and drugs.

H .R. 1267, introduced by Rep. Whitehurst (R., Va.),
would amend the Horse Protection Act of 1970 to pro-
vide for criminal sanctions for anyone who interferes
with any person while engaged in the performance of
his official duties under this Act. This bill would also
change the authorization of appropriations. This pro-
posed legislation was stimulated by experiences of sev-
eral veterinary inspectors who were threatened or in-
timidated at horse shows while carrying out their ofﬁcial
inspection duties.

H .R. 583, introduced by Rep. Green (D., Pa.), would
amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to
provide for inspection of facilities used in harvesting
and producing ﬁsh and ﬁshery products for commercial
purposes.

H .R. 584 was introduced by Rep. Green (D., Pa.) to
regulate the interstate trafﬁcking and sale of hypodermic
Syringes. This legislation relates to the current and
Wldespread drug addiction. It was introduced because
there are no federal regulations dealing with the inter-
state transactions in hypodermic syringes and because
0f the ease with which any person can acquire a hypo-
dermic needle or syringe without a medical certiﬁcate.

H.R. 835, introduced by Rep. Murphy (D., N.Y.),
Would require the Secretary of Transportation to pro-
SCribe regulations concerning the humane treatment of
ammals transported in air commerce. \

‘ H.R. 1171, introduced by Rep. Scherle (R., Iowa},
W0111d amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

Act to revise certain requirements for approval of new
animal drugs. This legislation deals with the “Delaney
Clause” and would include the following guideline in
the Act, “or if any such residue is found, that the
amount or form of such residue has been shown, by
scientiﬁc disclosure considered appropriate by the Secre-
tary, not to induce cancer in humans.” Rep. Scherle
introduced similar legislation in the 92nd Congress.

H.R. 1736, introduced by Rep. Downing (D., Va.),
would amend the Public Health Service Act to encour-
age physicians, dentists, and optometrists and other
medical personnel to practice in areas where shortages
of such personnel exist, There already exists a program
within the HEW to provide for such shortages. A num-
ber of medical personnel have already been placed in
urban and rural areas where such medical service has
been lacking.

Consumer Protection

H.R. 21, introduced by Rep. Holiﬁeld of California
and co-sponsors, would establish an Office of Consumer
Affairs in the Executive Ofﬁce of the President and a
Consumer Protection Agency. Such organizations would
help to secure within the federal government effective
protection and representation of the interest of con-
sumers.

During the past several years, many bills and reso-
lutions have been introduced into both houses of Con-
gress on this subject. Consumer protection ofﬁces and
programs have been established within the federal gov-
ernment and within the ofﬁce of the President. Mrs.
Virginia Knauer has been the Director of the OfﬁCe for
the President.

Mea’r lnspec’rion

H.R. 744, introduced by Rep. Matsunaga (D., Ha-
waii), would provide that poultry and meat byproducts
prepared from diseased animals would be considered
adulterated.

H.R. 1074, introduced by Rep. Roybal (D., Calif.),
would amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act to change
the ingredient requirements for meatfood products sub-
ject to the Act. This would insert grading into the Meat
Inspection Program. It would exclude some items not
now permitted in any food. Deﬁnitions of meat products
can best be handled by regulations rather than by law.

H.R. 1162, introduced by Rep. Scherle (R., Iowa),
would amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act by pro-

viding for more effective inspection of imported meat
and meat products. The bill would require at least 4
inspections a year for each foreign establishment ex-
porting meat to the United States. The bill would also
require the inspection of at least 2% of each imported
lot of fresh or frozen meats. The bill provides that cost
of carrying out this program would be defrayed by the
foreign packer.

H.R. 1572, introduced by Rep. Ford (D., Mich.) and
co-sponsors, would amend the Federal Meat Inspection
Act in order to provide that states may not have less
strict standards with respect to marketing, labeling,
packaging, and ingredient requirements than those un-
der the Federal Meat Inspection Act.

BioIogics Inspection

HR. 1192, introduced by Rep. Smith (D., Iowa),
would provide for the establishment of a veterinary bio-
logics facility by the USDA. The proposed bill lists
Ames, Iowa, as a possible location for the proposed
laboratory. A similar bill was introduced in the 92nd
Congress.

Wildlife Conservation

HR. 38, introduced by Rep. Dingell ('D., Mich.)
and co-sponsors, would authorize the Secretary of the
Interior to assist the states in controlling damage caused
by predatory animals. It would also provide a program
of research relating to the control and conservation of
such animals and would restrict the use of toxic chem-
icals as a method of control.

H.R. 730, introduced by Rep. Mailliard (R., Calif),
would provide protection for the ﬁsh resources of the
country, including fresh-water and ﬁsh—culture indus-
tries, against the introduction and dissemination of dis-
eases of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh.

Because of the growth of the ﬁsh industry and the
large scale interstate shipment of live ﬁsh and eggs, the
possibility of spreading disease has greatly increased.
The intensive ﬁsh culture operations also increase the
problem. The knowledge of communicable ﬁsh diseases

is limited, especially methods of disease spread and ther-
apeutic treatment.

Rabbit Inspection

S. 43, introduced by Senator Dole (R, Kan), WO111d
provide for mandatory inspection of rabbits slaughtered
for human food. This bill incorporates the inspection of
rabbits into the already existing Poultry Inspection Act.

A similar bill was introduced in the 92nd Congress

Toward More Responsible Pet Ownership

The current furor in many localities over growing
numbers of neglected dogs and cats must be interpreted
as a sincere expression of humanitarian concern. Few
persons, least of all veterinarians, would dlsagree WIth
the viewpoint that animals domesticated by man are the
responsibility of man. Neglect of pets has stamed mod-
ern man’s record as a wise steward of th1s planet’s b10-
sphere. This sort of neglect especially blotches man’s
image when sick, injured, or half-starved pets become
wards of society because some persons are unable .or
unwilling to assume the responsibilities of pet ownershlp.

Currently, many municipal governments are takmg
a hard look at expenditures for collection, temporary
care, and euthanasia of stray dogs and cats. In some
communities, the tab has become regarded as an unfair
and exorbitant ﬁnancial burden to taxpayers. Accord-
ingly, civic, professional, and other leaders have begun
to search for alternative solutions to the problem.

In some instances, veterinarians have donated their
time and talents to organized programs for minimal cost,
nonproﬁt neutering of pets (male and female) owned by
indigent families. But even on an organized basis, e.g.,
in the operation of spay clin-

their pet’s health because of pyometra or mammary tu-
mors could still opt for ovariohysterectomy.

Several years ago, a repositol progesterone prepara-
tion was commercially available for the suppression of
estrus in bitches but was taken otl‘ the market because
of side effects that were deemed to be of greater conse-
quence than the potential benefit of its use. If the risk/
beneﬁt ratio of that or similar products were reevaluated
in the light of today’s concern for pet; population control,
perhaps such products could be put to good use in cities
where alleged pet population crises exist. Presumably,
other chemical means of estrus suppression are cur-
rently being investigated, but if even one potential side
effect would be viewed as unacceptable in a pet popula-
tion control program, there is little likelihood that the
pharmaceutical industry will invest much time and
money in seeking FDA approval for such products.

Thus, the matter becomes an issue of what can
and should be done now to supplement; the surgical neu-
tering of dogs and cats by private practitioners. The
logical ﬁrst step would seem to be for society to read-
dress itself to responsible pet ownership. And the keys

 

ics, veterinarians cannot be

expected to make a signiﬁcant
dent in the seemingly never-
ending reservoir of fertile dogs
and cats. Further, humane
organizations operate from
budgets that scarely allow for
an increased and signiﬁcant
role in pet population control.
Thus, other methods of pet
population control must be
explored as supplements to
surgical neutering of dogs and
cats by private practitioners.

Sterilization of male dogs
and cats by immunologic
means, 'currently the object
of extensive research, holds
good promise as an eﬂicient
method of pet population con-
trol. Because the immuno-
logic approach would app-1y
only to males, owners of
bitches and queens who
would regard an intact repro-
ductive tract as a periodic in-
convenience or as a threat to

 

Steps that the Council on Veterinary Service
believes will lead to meaningful pet popula-
tion control:

I) Enforce existing animal control laws and
develop more comprehensive and improved
laws.

.2) License all cats and institute control
measures for them comparable to those for
dogs

3) Charge substantially higher license fees
for intact than for neutered animals.

4) Institute a crash public education-infor-
mation program designed to help pet owners
become more-responsible and concerned.

5) Refuse release of any domestic animal.
male or female. from animal shelters. public
or private. unless that animal has been ren-
dered sterile.

6) Encourage surgical sterilization until
medical sterilization is available.

7) Develop a nationwide identification sys-
tem to aid in identifying unwanted ’or un-
owned pets.

8) Conduct cooperative efforts and pro-
grams between humane organizations and
concerned groups.—Preliminary report of

as alluded to by the AVMA
Council on Veterinary Ser-
vice, seem to be extensive
public education, adequate
legislation, and strict enforce-
ment of such legislation. In
the article on minimal cost,
nonproﬁt veterinary service 1n
this issue of J.A.V.M.A. (page
481), the authors underscore
the need for education as a
means for changing attitudes
and behavior with regard to
pet ownership. Indeed, as
they assert, “. . . the inescap-

The annual meeting of the National
Mastitis Council, held February 5-7,
at Louisville, Ky., was attended by a
number of veterinarians, including re-
search workers, industrial veterinar-
ians, and private practitioners.

This year’s meeting featured pre-
sentations on mastitis control systems
by Drs. F. H. Dodd and Roger King-
will of the National Institute for Re-
search in Dairying, Reading, England.
Dr. John S. McDonald (WSU ’56),
National Animal Disease Laboratory,
Ames, Iowa, reported on uniform
methods for voluntary eradication of
Streptococcus agalactiae infections in
individual dairy herds, as proposed at
the 1972 meeting of the US. Animal
Health Association. Industry-wide
concern for an apparent increasing
prevalence of coliform mastitis was
reﬂected in comments made as part of
a panel discussion on coliform mas-
titis by Drs. D. E. Jasper (WSU ’42),
Davis, Calif., R. J. Eberhart (UP ’59),

Members of the AVMA Mastitis
Committee met during the meeting,
as has been their custom for several
years. The AVMA Mastitis Commit-
tee strongly supported the concept of
voluntary eradication of S. agalactiae-
mastitis but was not willing to support
compulsory regulation of this disease;
rather, the committee favored a pro-
gram for certifying the S. agalactiae-
free status of dairy herds. Resolutions
pertaining to eradication of S. agalac-
tiae-mastitis were presented to the
committee by Dr. McDonald, chair-
man of the USAHA Mastitis Com-
mittee. The ﬁnal draft of “Recom-

Nebraska Practitioners
Not Afraid of Involvement

Involvement, immediate and total,
was the reaction of practitioners in
the Hastings, Neb., area when they
learned early in January that one of
their colleagues, Dr. Leo Lemonds
(ISU ’49), of Hastings, had been crit-
ically injured in an automobile acci-
dent and would be hOSpitalized for a
long, slow recovery period.

Within days after the news, the fol-
lowing news release appeared in the
local press:

Veterinarians To Keep
Dr. Lemonds’ Practice Going

The veterinary practice of Dr.
Leo Lemonds of Hastings will con-
tinue, according to an announce-
ment made by the Nebraska V.M.A.
Executive Secretary Bob Garey of
Hastings.

Fellow veterinarians from the
area have volunteered their services
for Monday, Wednesday, and Fri-
day afternoons of each week from
1:30 to 5:00 pm. . . . to handle all
animals on an “out patient” basis.
. . . Veterinarians of the area are
anxious that Dr. Lemonds’ practice

440

continue and that clients who have
utilized his services in the past con-
tinue his services when he is fully
recovered, the participating veter-
inarians stated.

Serving on a rotating basis, the ﬁrst
group of volunteer practitioners to
man the Lemonds clinic were: Drs.
John M. Aiken (KSU ’49), Hastings;
James Barbee (KSU ’45) and Larry
Barbee (KSU ’55), Sutton; P. D.
Wiltfong (KSU ’52), Aurora; R. C.
Leslie (COL ’53), Grand Island; C. F.
Neumann (COL ’66), Hastings; Jerry
Erickson (KSU ’72), Sutton; and vet-
erinarians at the Grand Island Veter-
inary Clinic and the Kearney Veter-
inary Clinic.

Usual fees are charged, but all cli—
ents are directed to pay them to the
Lemonds clinic. A second group of
veterinary volunteers was scheduled
to serve in March.

Mr. Garey, who is also involved in
the project, said, “We are extremely
proud of these veterinarians who have
so generously responded to a fellow

veterinarian whose misfortune is so
great.” He observed that although
the practitioners acted out of sheer
devotion to their profession, the result
has been increased public good Will
toward the profession and excellent
coverage by the press, including agri-
cultural and farm publications.

Meanwhile, the Lemonds family and
the Nebraska V.M.A. are continuing
to search for a full—time practitioner
to carry on Dr. Lemonds’ practice
beyond the temporary arrangements
so generously provided by veterinar-
ians who were not afraid to get in-
volved.

Horse Identification Methods
Enter Computer Age,
WSU Seminar Reveals

The science of permanently and un-
alterably identifying animals has en-
tered the computer age. The romantic
era of the rope, cowboy, and red-hot
branding iron is passing into nostalgia.
This change was clear during an
international seminar on horse identi-
ﬁcation held Dec. 8—9, 1972, at
Washington State University under
sponsorship of the WSU Cooperative
Extension Service.

Experts from the United States and
foreign nations explained new horse
identiﬁcation methods to 75 horse
breed representatives and identiﬁca—
tion officials attending the seminar.

Freeze Marking

Dr. Gustaf Bjorck (STK ’48), a
Swedish veterinarian, told of his coun-
try’s horse identiﬁcation system that
utilizes freeze marking, a painless and
permanent method of marking an anl-
mal with ultracold branding irons.
Dr. Norman Hooven, USDA scien—
tist from Beltsville, Md., described
his research which has determined
the optimum ages of animals and
most successful methods of freeze
marking animals. Australia uses
freeze brand, Mr. G. w. Lilley, regis-
trar of race horses in that country
said, which are coded into a computer
to describe a horse’s age, sex, color,
and markings. He also explained NeW
Zealand’s method of freeze marking
its trotting horses.

Laser Beam

Dr. Keith Farrell (WSU ’55),
USDA research veterinarian stationed
at WSU and an organizer of the sem-
inar, said that he has successfully

branded animals, includingﬁsh, with
a laser beam. Although this techno]-
Ogy needs refining,_Dr. Farrell believes
it will be a practical animal identiﬁ-
cation method in the future.

Other Methods

Dr. Henrie Majeau. electronics re-
search scientist with the Boeing Com-
pany in Seattle, described a method
of implanting electronic sensors under
the skin of an animal that can be
numerically read and fed into a com-
puter when the animal passes by a
radar scanning device. A patented
lip-tattooing system that assures posi-
tive horse identity at race tracks
around the nation was described by
Mr. Spencer Drayton, secretary of the
Thoroughbred Racetrack Protective
Bureau in New York.

The photography method of horse
identiﬁcation used by the Jockey Club
in New York was described by Mr,
Calvin Rainey. executive secretary.
This method utilizes the principle
that the “nighteyes” or “chestnuts”
on the inside of horse legs are as
individualistic as ﬁngerprints in man.
The Arabian Horse Registry’s method
of utilizing unalterable combinations
of angles instead of numbers was de-
scribed. The angle svstem was devel-
oped by WSU’s Dr. Farrell.

tist at the University of California.

Drastic Cuts in Federal Support for
Veterinary Medical Education
Proposed in Nixon Budget

The president’s budget for the ﬁscal
year ending June 30, 1974, as pre-
sented to the Congress on January
29, proposes drastic cuts in federal
support for veterinary medical ed-
ucation. Stating that evidence does
not show the same urgency for in-
creased numbers of professionals in
“the other professional ﬁelds” than
medicine, dentistry, and osteopathy,
the President’s budget provides no
funds for capitation grants to schools
of veterinary medicine, optometry,
podiatry, and pharmacy for 1974.
Under the Comprehensive Health
Manpower Training Act of 1971, these
funds were to be available through
1974.

There are also indications that the
level of funds for capitation grants
for the ﬁscal year ending June 30,
1973, will be signiﬁcantly reduced. In
1972, these grants provided approx—
imately $7 million to veterinary
schools, or approximately $1,450 per
student. Estimates of the reduction
proposed by the President’s budget
range from 30 to 50%.

As a result, veterinary schools
which in good faith took on sig-
niﬁcantly larger enrollments to help
meet the profession’s manpower needs
may now be unable to meet their
commitments.

Following is the text of the Pres-
ident’s budget relating to health
manpower:

There is evidence of continuing na-
tional need for increased numbers of
professionals in medicine, dentistry,
and osteopathy. The same urgency is
not evident for the other professional
ﬁelds. The achievement of efforts
under the Comprehensive Health
Manpower Training Act of 1971,
coupled with the ﬁscal limits of the
federal budget, leads to the decision
to reduce in 1973 and terminate in
1974 capitation payments to educa-
tional institutions other than the 125
schools of medicine and osteopathy
and the 58 schools of dentistry.

The 1974 funding level for health
professions capitation remains virtu-
ally level with 1973, since the decrease
resulting from elimination of schools
for veterinarians, optometrists, podi-
atrists, and pharmacies is offset by the
increase in capitation for medicine,
dentistry, and osteopathy, as a result
of larger enrollments.

On January 30, the day following
the presentation of this budget to the
Congress, the Joint Committee on
Veterinary Education, representing
AVMA and the Association of Amer-
ican Veterinary Medical Colleges, met
in Washington. The committee plans
to take an active part in this matter.

 

which only describe ownership if a
ﬁrebrand is present.

The New Mexico program also es-
tablishes ofﬁcial vaccination proce-
dures and reaction to equine infec-
tious anemia, and other diseases, as
part of the identiﬁcation card. ThlS
is the ﬁrst major change in overall
identiﬁcation procedures, excluding
race horses, that has occurred in over

2,000 years.

Detection of Fraud

A portion of the program was de-
voted to a discussion of the .detectlon
of fraud in horse identiﬁcation. Two
WSU veterinarians, Drs. Tom G. Bell

(WSU ’69) and George Padgett
(MSU ’61), discussed laboratory
methods of detecting fraud in freeze-
marked horses. Dr. Bell has devel-
oped a method of detecting freeze-
marked hair by passing polarized light
through it and examining it under a
microscope. Dr. Padgett has devel-
oped a method of microscopic skin
examination that will detect freeze
markings through changes in the sweat
glands and skin pigmentation cells.

I Dr. Roy I. Hostetler (WSU ’39),
WSU extension veterinarian, and Dr.
Joe Johnson, extension animal scien-
tist, assisted with the organization and
operation of the seminar.

Dean Allam Appointed

to New Office

Dr. Mark W. Allam (UP ’32) ,dean
of the School of Veterinary Med1c1ne,
University of Pennsylvania, has been

 

Dr. Mark W. Allam

appointed assistant vice president for
health affairs at the University. In
that capacity, he will be charged with
responsibility for fund raising and de-
velopment for the School of Veter-
inary Medicine. He will assume his
new post as soon as his successor has
been named.

During Dr. Allam’s 20-year tenure
as dean, the School of Veterinary
Medicine has become a national cen—
ter for developing specialties in veter-
inary medicine, paralleling specialties
in human medicine. Prominent among
these are orthopedic surgery, derma-
tology, ophthalmology, and anesthe-
siology. Major interdisciplinary re-
search projects instituted in the last
two decades include the Comparative
Cardiovascular Studies Unit, the In-
terdisciplinary Cancer Research Unit,
and laboratories on animal reproduc-
tion and nutrition.

President Martin Meyerson, Uni—
versity of Pennsylvania, said, “Under
Dr. Allam’s leadership, the nation’s
second oldest veterinary school has
become second to none in academic
excellence. Not only has he attracted
and maintained a distinguished fac—
ulty, he has successfully expanded the
school’s physical facilities so that en-
rollment could be doubled over the
years.”

Dr. Allam joined the University of
Pennsylvania faculty in 1943, after
engaging in private practice in Media,
Pa., for 13 years. In 1945, he became
assistant professor of veterinary sur-
gery and in 1953 was appointed dean.
He was the ﬁrst veterinarian to do
graduate work in surgery in the

442

School of Medicine of the University
of Pennsylvania (1936—1938) and
later served as a member of the med-
ical school’s Harrison Department of
Surgical Research for 6 years. .He
pioneered in the treatment of animal
tumors with radiation and developed
several diagnostic devices and surgical
techniques.

Dr. Allam has served AVMA as a
member of the Executive Board and
as a director of the Association’s Foun-
dation. He is a former chairman of
the American College of Veterinary
Surgeons’ Board of Regents.

In 1969, he was honored with the

AVMA Award and twice he has re-
ceived the “Veterinarian of the Year”
award—-from the Pennsylvania V.M.A,
in 1964 and the American Animal
HOSpital Association in 1957. He
served as president of the Philadel-
phia Society for Promoting Agricul.
ture from 19621966 and received the
Society’s annual award in 1971. He
is a member of both the American and
Pennsylvania Public Health Associa-
tions. Among his civic activities, Dr.
Allam is a former president of the
Media Board of Education and pres.
ently a member of the Pennsylvania
Citizens Council.

Mysterious Animal Disease

Worries Experts

Strong control measures against a
mysterious ailment with characteris-
tics similar to foot-and—mouth disease
(FMD) were recommended at a recent
emergency meeting in Rome, Italy, of
the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion’s European Commission for the
Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease.

The disease, which the Commission
has agreed to call “swine vesicular
disease,” has appeared recently in the
United Kingdom, Austria, Italy, and
Poland. An epizootic near Bordeaux,
France, is also being studied to see
whether the same disease is present
there.

Differences Noted Between
SVD and FMD

Swine vesicular disease differs from
foot—and-mouth disease in that it is
conﬁned to pigs and is less contagious
—FMD can be transmitted to a whole
spectrum of farm animals, including
cattle and sheep. The new epizootics
resemble others that occurred in Italy
in 1966 and in Hong Kong in 1971.
However, scientists have not yet de—
termined whether the virus strain is
the same.

A worrisome aspect of the disease
is that the pigs display outward symp-
toms that appear identical to FMD,
and animal health authorities cannot
be sure of the nature of the problem
on their hands until laboratory tests
are made. Thus the Commission has
recommended that control measures
be taken immediately, exactly as if
the epizootics were proved cases of

FMD. The measures include, when
possible, slaughter of infected and ex-
posed pigs and destruction of car-
casses. .

“The great danger,” said Commis-
sion Chairman Gwyn Beynon, chlef
veterinary ofﬁcer of the United King-
dom, “is that it would be extremely
difficult to exert effective control of
FMD if swine vesicular disease be-
came widespread.”

Dr. Beynon reported that there had
been 15 epizootics of swine ves1cular
disease in the United Kingdom s1nce
Dec. 11, 1972. At ﬁrst, British au-
thorities assumed they were con-
fronted with FMD and ordered cattle
and sheep, as well as pigs, slaughtered.
But tests at the World Reference Lab-
oratory, Pirbright, UK, later ruled out
FMD. Ultimately, Britain alene
slaughtered more than 3,600 plgs.
Lesser numbers have been slaughtered
in the other countries affected.

Original Source of Infection
in Question

In the United Kingdom, Italy, and
Poland, authorities have not yet been
able to determine the original sourceS
of infection. The Austrian delegaltlon
to the emergency meeting of the Com-
mission, however, reported that tVYO
epizootics of the disease in Austrla
were traced to imported pigs.

Those attending the meeting agreed
that swine vesicular disease should be
added to the list of diseases that, by

13W, must be reported to animal health
authorities.

Veterinarian Finds Clue
to Spread of Tox0plasmosis

Cockroaches and wild cats may 101“
the domestic cat and other animals as
carriers of toxoplasmosis. Scientists
at the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and
investigators supported by the In?“
tute report new evidence implicatlng
these species in the transmission 0
the toxo organism.

Although usually a mild disease,
toxoplasmosis can be extremely serious
in pregnant women who contract it.
Like German measles, toxoplasmosis
may cause congenital defects in an un-
born child, while causing a mild or
symptomless disease in the mother.
More than one-third of all adult Amer-
icans are infected by the toxo orga-
nism at some time during their lives.

Despite the prevalence of toxoplas-
mosis, its modes of transmission are
still not well understood. Recently,
studies have indicated that domestic
cats may be a major reservoir for hu-
man infections. Cats consume birds
or rodents carrying the parasite,
resulting in the growth and multiplica-
tion of the parasites within the cat’s in~
testine. The cat then excretes the par-
asites in the form of oocysts. Filth
ﬂies, 1 to 2 days after eating infected
cat feces, have been found capable
of transmitting infectious tox0plasma
oocysts to human food.

Now, Dr. G. D. Wallace (COL ’54)
of NIAID’s Paciﬁc Research Unit has
discovered that 2 common species of
cockroaches are capable of harboring
and shedding infectious oocysts for
several days under laboratory condi-
tions. In Dr. Wallace’s experiments,
Madeira and American cockroaches
were starved and then allowed access
to eat feces containing infectious toxo-
plasma oocysts. He tested roach feces
and digestive tracts for infectivity in
mice. Toxoplasma was isolated from
the cockroach’s digestive tract as long
as 7 days and from cockroach feces as
long as 9 to 10 days after cockroaches
had last been in contact with cat feces.

In nature, it is possible that cock-
roaches might eat infective cat feces
and, in turn, contaminate human food.
Cockroaches and ﬁlth ﬂies might also
play a role in the life cycle of toxo-
plasma by serving as a source of in-
fection for birds and small wild ro-
dents. Such animals, normally the
prey of cats, are found naturally in-
fected with tox0plasma and are po-
tential intermediate hosts of the
parasite.

In another study, University of
Kansas scientists, supported in part
by NIAID, found that not only d0-
mestic cats, but other members of the
Cat family can Spread tox0plasma par-
aS1tes through oocysts in their feces.

e studies were carried out in col-
alifOration with investigators at the
Mlddle America Research Unit and
the US. Army Medical Research Unit
1n the Panama Canal Zone and in
Costa Rica. Scientists fed mice in-
fected with tox0plasma cysts to several
Wild animals from the cat and raccoon
famllies. The investigators isolated

Interest in Simmental Cattle Grows

 

The 5th annual meeting and sale of the American Simmental Association, January l6,
in Denver, Colo., drew a record-breaking attendance, including many interested veter-
inarians. Although the breed, native to Switzerland, is one of the oldest and largest in
the world, it was introduced into America only a few years ago. Today there are 50,000
registered cattle. POpular because of their growth and meat-producing capabilities, the
purebred and crossbred calves weigh up to 600 lb. at weaning and fed steers up to

l,200 lb. at l year.

Participants at the association’s meeting included (left to right)—Drs. Dan Anderson,
Fort Worth, Texas; Harry Furgeson, Anaconda, Mont; Mr. Jerry Moore, president,
American Simmental Association; Drs. K. F. Wells, Veterinary Director General for Canada;

and W. O. Kester, Golden, Colo.

the tox0plasma parasite from the feces
of one jaguarundi and two ocelots in
the study.

These ﬁndings explain the reported
occurrence of toxoplasmosis in non—
meat—eating animals in regions where
domestic cats do not exist. Jag-
uarundis, ocelots, and possibly other
wild felines could serve as the primary
host for the parasite in the jungle,
where house cats are rare or absent.

Foreign Veterinary Students
Available for Summer

Employment

Every year during the months of
July, August, and September, several
veterinary students from EurOpean
veterinary colleges come to the United
States seeking either (1) summer vet—
erinary employment or (2) work with
a veterinarian from a few days to sev-
eral weeks just for room and board.
Most students will write to the

AVMA, or to the dean of one of our
veterinary colleges, or to a veterinarian
they happen to have met in Europe
many months before they expect to
arrive. Others just “show up.”

All of them wish to see as much of
US. veterinary medicine and the
United States as possible in the time
available, and their personal funds are
limited. Language differences have
not been a problem, since most for-
eign students have studied English.
They generally travel by International
Greyhound ticket, which is unlimited.

The AVMA could assist these vis-
itors if American veterinarians and
their families who are willing to have
a student for a few days, weeks, or the
entire summer were known.

If you are interested in cooperating
with the AVMA on this project, indi-
cate your willingness by writing to:
Director, Membership and Field Ser-
vices, American Veterinary Medical
Association, 600 S. Michigan Ave.,
Chicago, 111. 60605. You will receive
a form to ﬁll out indicating informa-
tion essential to developing a success-
ful program.

Auburn Adds Business
Course for Veterinary
Students

A new course speciﬁcally designed
for seniors in the School of Veterinary
Medicine has been added to the De-
partment of Accounting and Finance,
School of Business at Auburn Uni-
versity.

The course will provide information
on record-keeping systems and report-
ing required by law for veterinary
practitioners. Comparative business
forms will be examined to provide a
basis for choice by the veterinarian
when he establishes his practice.

The workshop-seminar type presen-
tations will also discuss legal liability
in connection with professional and
business practices, and the student
will be apprised of his tax responsi-
bility with respect to licensing, prop-
erty, and income reporting. In gen-
eral, the course seeks to develop an
understanding, not an expertise, in
the economic, ﬁnancial, and institu-
tional framework in which the future
veterinarian will live and function.

Assisting in the development of the
new course was Dr. Greg Boring
(AUB ’70) of the School of Veter-
inary Medicine. The course will be
taught beginning in the 1973 summer
quarter and will be an elective for all
students in veterinary medicine. It is
a 1-quarter, 3-credit-hour course.

Florida Horse Course
Sets Pace

Florida Technical University is now
offering a 10—week course in the care
and handling of horses. Response to
the 3-credit horse management course,
under the wing of FTU’s continuing
education program, has been enthusi-
astic. Forty-one persons enrolled on
the ﬁrst night of classes, with nearly
the same number turned away.

Teachers for the new course are Dr.
Paul E. May (AUB ’70), currently
in the US. Air Force on special as-
signment to the Orlando Naval Train-
ing Center, and Dr. Robert E. Walton
(GA ’59), private practitioner in Or-
lando since 1965. Both are members
of the American Association of Equine
Practitioners, and Dr. Walton is well
known to horse owners for his work
with the Florida Horsemen’s Asso-
ciation.

Students enrolled in the class in-
clude housewives, full-time college
students, teenagers, FTU faculty and

446

staff, businessmen, and couples. The
obvious popularity of the course has
given rise to plans for a second one
to start in March. .

The course includes a brief history
of the horse; coat colors and breeds;
anatomy; handling, with practlcal
demonstrations; eating habits and nu-
trition; broodmare management; dis-
eases; and ﬁeld trips to the state diag—
nostic laboratory at Kissimmee and to
a breeding farm. The course is be-
lieved to be the ﬁrst continuing edu—
cation course of its kind ever taught
by a member of the State University
System.

N.Y. High School Introduces
Course in Animal Handling

With the approval of parents and
faculty, New York City’s Board of
Education and the United Pet Deal-
ers’ Association have joined in launch—
ing a revolutionary new program at
Brooklyn’s Abraham Lincoln High
School. A study course in pet shop
management and animal handling
was inaugurated recently with the ar-
rival of the ﬁrst pets—5 adult and 1
baby chinchilla. The latter was born
in ﬂight from Miami to the New York
school. The entire shipment was
donated by a pet farm in Miami.

Dr. Jack Pollock, school principal,
said the new program will teach stu-
dents the importance of proper care,
feeding, breeding habits, and neces-
sary medical treatment for animals.
The school pet shop will be fully
equipped to include cages, pumps,
tanks, elaborate electrical heating sys-
tem, and necessary medical supplies.

If the program is successful, addi-
tional pet shop courses will be con-
sidered for other New York City high
schools.

U.S. Army Health Professions

Michigan Starts Preventive
Regulatory Veterinary
Medical Program

The Michigan preventive regulatory
veterinary medicine continuing educa-
tion (CE) program has been under
development since the fall of 1969.
Now state and federal animal health
veterinarians have joined in the effort
with encouragement and support of
their agencies and Michigan State
University.

There will be three general areas
of development. First, there will be a
general program that will enable vet-
erinarians to keep abreast of recent
developments in medicine and science.
The second area of development will
be to provide ﬁeld personnel, in coop-
eration with local universities, with
resolutions to ﬁeld problems. This
effort will seek to provide for individ-
ual credit toward advanced degrees.
Third, with the potential for develop-
ing a college of preventive regulatory
veterinary medicine within the struc-
ture of AVMA, there would be the
possibility of developing a veterinary
diplomate program.

The Michigan CE program for pre-
ventive regulatory veterinary medicine
is presently well along in the develop-
ment of the ﬁrst goal—a general pro-
gram of medical and scientiﬁc educa-
tion exposure. Every effort is being
extended to develop and proceed in
the other two educational areas: ﬁeld
problem resolution and qualiﬁcations
for a college of preventive regulatory
veterinary medicine.

Missouri Professor Named

Consultant, USAF Office

Dr. Donald C. Blenden (MO ’56),
professor of veterinary microbiology
and associate professor of community
health and medical practice, School of
Veterinary Medicine, University of
Missouri, has been appointed as a na-
lilonal consultant in veterinary med-
icine to the Surgeon General of the
US. Air Force.

Consultants in all areas of health
and medicine are selected for their ex-
pertise in a ﬁeld and serve under a
Civil service appointment. They are
called on to advise the Surgeon Gen-
eral and to serve primarily in a teach-
mg capacity. They visit area and
FEgional Air Force hospitals with
teaching programs and participate in
gonferences and symposiums in veter-
lnary medicine.

Dr. Blenden’s ﬁrst assignment as a

March l5. I973

consultant will be to participate and
lecture in the Annual Symposium of
Veterinary Medicine in March, 1973,
to be held at the School of Health
Care Science at Sheppard AFB.

New Features for
“Index Veterinarius” and
“Veterinary Bulletin”

As the result of the adoption of
computerized techniques, including
printing by photocomposition, under
the Commonwealth Agricultural Bu-
reaux Mechanization Scheme, both
Index Veterinarius and the Veterinary
Bulletin are now being produced
mechanically by INSPEC for the vol-
ume years 1972 and 1973.

All major items of veterinary liter-
ature are abstracted in the Veterinary
Bulletin and listed in Index Veter—
inarius. In addition, titles in ﬁelds
relating to veterinary medicine and
other biological sciences, minor con-
tributions, and extension literature,
are listed by title only in Index Vet-
erinarius. Coverage is kept up to date
through a constant review of journals
scanned. Recently arrangements have
been made with the Institute of Sta—
tistics and Documentation of the Free
University of Berlin for a regular sup-
ply of titles of articles appearing in
German language veterinary periodi-
cals in order to improve coverage of
German veterinary literature.

Titles are selected from nearly 850
serial publications regularly scanned
and from books, monographs, annual
reports, and other nonSerial publica-
tions.

Under the new system, Index Vet-
erinarius is now produced monthly
instead of quarterly, and as a result,
the delay between publication of an
article and its listing in Index Veter-
inarius has been reduced from 8 and
9 months to less than 12 weeks. The
new journal provides more detailed
subject headings and citations of for—
eign language titles, facilitating refer-
ence to original articles. There will
be an annual cumulative edition, and
the information will also be available
on magnetic tapes.

The Veterinary Bulletin, also now
produced by computer techniques,
continues to be a monthly journal.

Alaskan Wild Rodent
a Possible Research Model

 

Arctic veterinary biologist Dr. Robert A.
Dieterich is doing research on the special
natural characteristics of the collared lem-
ming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) in Fair-
banks, Alaska. This species of wild rodent,
found only in the Arctic regions, may be
the most useful animal model yet discov-
ered for studies of cholesterol level and
mammary tumor as well as for research on
prOQressive degeneration of the kidneys due
to infection.

The Arctic wildlife research project is being
conducted by the Institute of Arctic Biology
at the University of Alaska with the support
of the National Institutes of Health Division
of Research Resources. Dr. Dieterich is a
1963 graduate of the University of Cal-
ifornia School of Veterinary Medicine.

Veterinary Version of .
“Candy Striper” at IIIinons

A special version of the .“Candy
Striper” (hospital volunteer) 1s found
in the Small Animal Clinic of the
University of Illinois College of Vet-
erinary Medicine. Two high school
girls—Sue Yancey and Terri Schume—
work after school and on weekends
feeding, bathing, and cleaning up after
the patients in residence—dogs and
cats mostly, with an occasional mon-
key, snake, or bird.

The girls, both of whom want to be
veterinarians, are not paid for their
regular work. However, when the uni-
versity is out of session and the girls
take over for the veterinary students
in caring for “their” dogs, they are
reimbursed for the increased work
load they carry. The girls feel their
work at the university clinic gives
them ﬁrst-hand experience for their
future careers. Regular employees at
the clinic say the girls work well and
enjoy what they are doing.

The same broad-spectrum microbicidal power of a BETADINE formulation that was selected by NASA
for decontamination procedures in the Apollo 11/12/14 lunar missions splashdowns is now available
for veterinary use in BETADINE Surgical Scrub Veterinary and BETADINE Solution Veterinary. They
are decisively bactericidal, killing both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Action is prompt
and maintained in the presence of blood, pus, serum or necrotic tissue. BETADINE preparations are

Tobacco Stalks by Pregnant Sows

M. Ward Crowe, D.V.M., and H. T. Pike, B.S.

SUMMARY

Arthrogryposis was detected in approximately half
of more than 2,000 newborn pigs on 13 farms in Ken-
tucky during a 5-year period. The anomaly was asso-
ciated with the ingestion of tobacco stalks discarded
after the tobacco-curing season.

 

NONHERITABLE malformations of man and lower animals
have attracted much attention in the last decade. Ma-
ternal ingestion of skunk cabbage (Veratru'm califor-
nicum) has been shown to cause anomalies in ovine
fetuses.2 Mountain lupine (Lupinus caudatus) is the
Cause of a congenital disorder of newborn calves in
Western states.5

A malformation of newborn pigs characterized by
severe arthrogryposis was ﬁrst encountered in central
Kentucky in 1967.3 On ﬁeld investigations on a num-
ber of farms in ensuing years, a relationship between
the malformation and ingestion of tobacco stalks by
SOWS in early pregnancy was suspected. Thirteen sep-
arate episodes of congenital deformities involving more

VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

than 1,000 deformed pigs farrowed by more than 200
sows have been investigated by us. All of these sows
had access to tobacco stalks during early pregnancy and
in several instances were known to have ingested stalks
of burley tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) during gesta-
tion. The time of exposure to the tobacco stalks and
the time of farrowing indicated that the period during
which adverse effects on the fetus occurred was between
day 10 and day 30 of pregnancy.

Deformed pigs were reported on two farms in Mis-
souri in 197 0.4 In both instances it was suspected that
tobacco was related to the anomalies. The deformi-
ties found in Missouri were apparently identical to
those seen in Kentucky. This report is concerned with
retrospective analysis of congenital anomalies associated
with the feeding of tobacco stalks to pregnant sows on
13 Kentucky farms.

Clinical Signs

All known episodes of congenital deformities in new-
born pigs occurred during the months of January, Feb-
ruary, March, or April except for one farm on which
there was an occurrence in both March and July (Table
1). The largest number of sows involved was on one
farm where 29 sows farrowed 129 deformed pigs and
130 normal pigs in a 14-day period. In that instance,
the occurrence in litters ranged from a litter of 9 nor-
mal pigs to a litter with 10 deformed and 2 normal pigs.
The number of pigs deformed on a given farm has usu-
ally approximated 50%.

When litters of deformed pigs are farrowed, the
duration of parturition is usually extended by several
hours, and many of the pigs are born dead from neo-
natal asphyxiation. Those deformed are usually unable
to rise and usually die within a few hours from
hypoglycemia.

The deformity does not seem to be sex-linked. Of
63 deformed pigs farrowed by 11 sows in one herd, 31
were males and 32 were females.

Gross Pathologic Findings

In our experience, the anomaly has involved prin-
cipally the appendicular skeleton, but the spinal column
and the mandible have also been affected. Anatomic

structures other than the skeletal system have not
been involved, except to compensate for the skeletal

malformations. .
The outstanding feature of this syndrome is arth-

rogryposis involving all limbs. The mildcst form of the
anomaly is a clubbing either of both front feet or of
both hind feet.

The anomaly may be manifested in several ways
(Fig. 1 and 2). There may be extension or ﬂexion of

 

Fig. 2—Newbom pigs with various limb anomalies.

the forelimbs or hindlimbs, or both. In many instanceS
the forelimbs are extended and cannot be ﬂexed,
whereas the hindlimbs are acutely ﬂexed at the tibio-
tarsal joint. In a few instances all limbs are malforme

and the dorsal curvature of the spinal column is accen‘
tuated. Brachygnathia, along with the other skeletal
anomalies, has been observed occasionally. Cleft lip,
cleft palate, hydrocephalus, or other cranial anomalies
have not been observed. Malformations of internal 01"
gans have not been detected.

Dissection of affected limbs usually reveals the bones
to be thickened, abnormally curved, twisted alongr the
long axis, and shortened. Abnormal fusion of bones has
not been observed. Inability of affected pigs to ﬂex or
extend the limbs appears to be due to malalignmelIt 0
the joints.

Relationship to Tobacco

On every farm where anomalies have been detected
the sows had access to freshly discarded tobacco stalks.
In several instances they were seen ingesting the stalks.
Swine are exposed to tobacco stalks as a result of the
management practices of tobacco and hog farmers. In
Kentucky, burley tobacco matures in late August and
September. The plants are cut off near the ground by
hand, placed on sticks, and hung in barns to dry. Be-
ginning in midNovember, the leaves are removed from
the stalks and tied in bundles to be sold, and the stalks
are discarded. Agronomists recommend that these
stalks be placed back on the land to return nutrients to
the soil. At the time the stalks are discarded they are
quite woody on the outside, but have a succulent cen-
tral pith with a consistency similar to that of celery.
When the stalks are placed on a ﬁeld where hogs are
conﬁned, the animals will shred the stalks and consume
the pith. Clinical signs of illness or deaths have not
been reported among hogs that ingest this material.

When this problem was ﬁrst recognized and the re-
lationship between the anomalies and tobacco stalks
was deduced, various insecticides and other chemicals
routinely applied to tobacco were suspected. Trials
were conducted to determine whether insecticides com-
monly used on tobacco were involved. Maleic hydra-
zide, dieldrin, DDT, and TDE had been applied to the
growing tobacco on the farms investigated. All of these
compounds were fed at various dosages to sows through-
out gestation without anomalies resulting.

With continuing ﬁeld investigation, it was learned
that on every farm where this problem occurred there
was heavy application of fertilizer to increase the to-
bacco yield per acre. On each of the farms where the
anomalies occurred the yield was at least 3,000 lb. of
tobacco per acre. The average yield of tobacco per acre
in Kentucky was 1,625 lb. in 1960, 2,160 lb. in 1965,
and 2,710 lb. in 1970. Increased fertilization and irriga-
tion to produce this higher yield have increased the size
of the stalk.

Total nitrogen, total alkaloids, and nitrite concen-
tration have been increased in cured tobacco leaf as ni-
trogen fertilization was increased.1 More than 1,200
components of tobacco have been identiﬁed, 117 of
which are alkaloids.6

Genetic Considerations

There appears to be no hereditary cause of these
anomalies. The 13 farms on which malformations have
been detected are located in 7 central Kentucky coun-
ties. There was no known genetic relationship between
the hogs on any of the farms. The sows were not pure-
bred, and usually nonregistered boars were used. In
most instances the sows had had two or more normal

March l5, I973

litters sired by the same boars, either before or after
affected litters were farrowed. On one farm, anomalous
pigs were farrowed in February of 1970, 1971, and 1972
by the same group of sows sired by the same boars, but
litters born at other times of the year by the same sows
mated to the same boars were normal. These sows were
exposed to tobacco stalks in November of 1969, 1970,
and 1971 and were observed shredding the tobacco
stalks and consuming the pith. In previous years this
farmer had not exposed his sows to tobacco stalks and
the sows farrowed normal pigs.

Nutritional Considerations

We do not have any evidence that this anomaly was
caused by a dietary deﬁciency. Although the nutrition
varied between farms, the usual ration consisted of corn
plus a protein supplement, with recommended levels of
vitamins and minerals added. The water source in all
cases was pond water.

Infectious Agent Considerations

There is no evidence that these anomalies were the
result of either infection or vaccination. There was no
history of clinical illness in the sows during gestation
nor was there any evidence of infection at or after par-
turition. None of the affected herds had a history of
abortion problems.

Vaccines have not been used consistently on the 13
farms. Occasionally erysipelas and leptospira bacterins
have been used, but modiﬁed live-virus or live-virus vac-
cines have not been administered.

Effect of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin on Pregnancy Rate of
Heifers, When Used Under Field Conditions

SUMMARY

Six experiments involving 677 heifers were conducted
to evaluate the effect of 1,500 I.U. of a beeswax and oil
standardized formulation of human chorionic gonado-
tropin (HCG) on pregnancy rate. Heifers in 4 of these
experiments were treated with 6—chloroA6-17 acetoxy-
progesterone (CAP) to synchronize estrus.

A single subcutaneous injection of 1,500 LU. of HCG
at the time of insemination increased pregnancy rates
in 5 of 6 experiments (P < 0.05) with synchronized and
with nonSynchronized heifers.

 

IN NORMALLY CYCLING cattle, fertilization rate and em-
bryo survival are considerably less than 100%. Even
lower fertilization rates have been reported in heifers at
the ﬁrst estrus following progestin treatment.4 Estimated
embryo survival of fertilized ova in cattle treated with
progestin also seemed to be less than in control heifers.

Human chorionic gonadotropin has been demon-
strated to be luteotrophic in the bovine species and will
in fact increase progesterone synthesis from bovine cor-
pus luteum slices in vitro3 as well as increase size of
corpus luteum in viva?!3

At the time of insemination, HCG will increase the
pregnancy rate of synchronized heifers at the ﬁrst syn-
chronized breeding period by 12.8%.5

This study was designed to conﬁrm, under ﬁeld con-
ditions, the increased pregnancy rate of synchronized
heifers and to investigate the response in nonsynchro-
nized heifers.

Materials and Methods

Human chorionic gonadotropin was assayed against the
International Standard.a LyOphilized HCG.b was suspended
in 5% beeswax and 95% sesame oil at the rate of 750 I.U./
ml. A placebo injection was prepared for control heifers,
using only the beeswax and sesame oil mixture. Two milli-

liters of HCG (1,500 I.U. of HCG) was in jectcd subcutaneously
at the time of insemination in heifers randomly assigned
to the treatment groups. Control heifers were given an in-
jection of the placebo material only.

All heifers in 4 of the experiments were treated with
CAP to synchronize estrus. A concentrate ration containing
CAP (11.0 mg./kg.) was fed at the rate of 0.91 kg./heifer/
day for 16 days (10 mg. CAP/heifer/day) followed by 0.45
kg./heifer/day (5.0 mg. CAP/heifer/day) for 2 days in trial
1. In trials 2, 3, and 4, the concentrate ration containing
the CAP was fed at the rate of 0.91 kg./heifer/day for 18
days (10 mg. CAP/heifer/day).

Beginning the ﬁrst day after the last offering of feed
with CAP, all heifers were observed for estrus at 12-hour in-
tervals for a period of at least 26 days. Each heifer was
inseminated approximately 12 hours after the onset of es-
trus. Synchronization rates (percentage in estrus during
ﬁrst 10 days after withdrawing CAP from the ration) were
83.1, 91.2, 92.7, and 74.8% for trials 1, 2, 3, and 4, respec-
tively. Pregnancy was determined by rectal palpation ap-
proximately 3 months after insemination.

Trial 1.—Of 77 cycling Hereford heifers, 64 were syn-
chronized. Feed containing CAP was provided each morn-
ing in troughs that allowed approximately 2 linear feet of
trough Space per heifer. This was the ﬁrst trough feeding
to which these heifers had ever been exposed. After con-
suming all the feed with CAP, heifers were allowed to range
over wheat pasture during the day. Semen from 4 different
bulls was equally distributed across both treatments.

Trial 2.—Of 82 yearling Hereford heifers, 75 were syn-
chronized with CAP. The feed containing CAP was tOP‘
dressed on a small amount of corn silage. Additional silage
was provided after the original mixture was consumed. Se-

men from a single ejaculate from 1 bull was used on all
heifers.

Trial 3.—Of 109 yearling Hereford heifers, 101 were syn-
chronized with CAP. The heifers were conﬁned to drylot at
night; feed containing CAP was fed each morning before the
heifers went out to pasture. Semen from 1 bull was used
for most heifers; however, a portion of the heifers involVed
1n a cross-breeding program were inseminated with semen

from bulls of other breeds. The bull effect was equalized
between treatments.

Trial 4.—Of 302 yearling crossbred heifers, 226 were
synchronized with CAP. These heifers were maintained on
corn Silage ad libitum plus 0.91 kg. of a high—energy supple‘
mental feed for a prefeeding period. The concentrate ratlon
contalnlng CAP was top-dressed on silage. During the syn—
chronized breeding period, so many heifers were in 65””
one afternoon that the breeding crews and facilities were
overtaxed. Thus, 29 heifers were bred at approximately
hours, rather than the standard 12 hours, after ﬁrst detec—

inators.

Trial 5.——Each of 95 Holstein-Friesian heifers was de-
termined (via rectal palpation) to be “open” and to have
a normal reproductive tract. About 18 kg. of alfalfa hay
was fed each heifer during the trial. A grain concentrate
mix was also fed at a rate of 2.25 kg. / heifer/ day. One per-
son did all of the inseminating, injected all treatment ma-
terials, and palpated the reproductive tract of each heifer
for determination of pregnancy 40 to 50 days after breeding.
Semen used was from a single ejaculate.

Trial 6.—A total of 116 yearling crossbred and Hereford
heifers were maintained in a feedlot and fed corn silage and
a supplemental high-energy feed. One person did most of
the insemmating, with semen from 1 Limousin bull used
on most of the heifers. Other inseminators and semen from
2 other bulls were involved with the remaining heifers.

Data were analyzed according to a method that weighs
the results from each trial equally.1

Results and Discussion

Results are presented (Table 1). Administration of
1,500 I.U. of HCG on CAP-synchronized heifers resulted in
an improved pregnancy rate (10.7 to 25.0%) in 3 of the
4 trials. In the 4th trial, 2 variables, inseminators and
bulls, were not equally distributed between the treated
and control groups. Therefore, the effect of these vari-
ables on treatment could not be evaluated. This is the
only trial in which the HCG was inadvertently stored at
high temperature (in a ranch truck where temperatures

may have reached 60 C.). Temperatures at this level
could have reduced the potency of HCG. »

Results of the 2 nonsynchronized trials (Table 1,
trials 5 and 6) indicated that HCG increased pregnancy
rate in both cases (17 .7 and 10.1%, respectively).

It was concluded that pregnancy rate in normally
cycling heifers was increased in 5 of 6 trials (P < 0.05)
after a subcutaneous injection of 1,500 LU. of HCG at
the time of insemination. This improvement in preg-
nancy rate may be expected in beef or dairy, synchro-
nized or nonsynchronized, normally cycling heifers.
These results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings in CAP-synchro-
nized heifers.5

Factors Inﬂuencing Dairy Calf Mortality in Michigan

W. D. Oxender, D.V.M., Ph.D.; L. E. Newman, D.V.M.; D. A. Morrow, D.V.M., PhD.

SUMMARY

A survey of 77 Michigan dairy herds during 1971
revealed calf mortality of 17.7% between birth and 60
days of age; calves born dead or dying during birth ac-
counted for 6.4%, those that died during the period
from birth to 14 days of age, 8.5%, and those that died
between 2 weeks and 2 months of age, 2.8%. Mortality
ranged from 16.1% for herds of less than 50 cows to
34.9% for herds of more than 200 cows. Diarrhea (70%
of the herds) and pneumonia (41% of the herds) were
indicated by dairymen as the major health problems in
young calves.

 

NEONATAL CALF mortality represents a major economic
loss to the cattle industry, with estimates of mortality
ranging from 8 to 25%.1’2’5’6 A recent survey of Mich-
igan farm records indicated a mean mortality of 13.5%
in 379 herds.10 A conservative estimate of the combined
dairy and beef calf economic loss in the United States
in 1964—$40 million1—was based on an estimate of
10% mortality and a value of $10 per calf. Substituting
today’s calf values, annual economic losses total well
over $200 million. Medication, extra labor, and stunted
and unthrifty animals further contribute to the economic
loss.

This report is concerned with a 1971 survey of Mich-
igan dairymen, taken in an attempt to determine what
factors inﬂuence dairy calf mortality.

Materials and Methods

Eleven area extension programs concerned with the pre-
vention of calf mortality were held in Michigan during
Januray, 1972. A 1-page questionnaire was presented to
one dairyman from each farm when he arrived at the meet-
ing. The questionnaires, representing 477 different dairy
farms, were completed and collected at these meetings.

Calf mortality was divided into'3 groups: (1) dead or
died during birth, (2) living at birth but died prior to 14

days of age, and (3) died between 15 and 60 days of age,
All data were calculated from the total number of calves
born and included both live and dead births. Information
from each herd was coded for computer analysis. A one-
way analysis of variance with unequal numbers was used
to analyze the results. Then Schef‘fe’s test was used to test
columns for signiﬁcant differences when there were more
than 2 factors.

Results

Data from all 11 areas were combined (Table 1) in-
asmuch as differences among the different areas were

and herd size were closely related. The larger herds
more often utilized free stalls or loose housing.

Use of colostrum during the postnatal period was
particularly important. The time of ﬁrst feeding of co-
lostrum after birth and the duration of feeding colostrum

housing and thus were inconclusive. In approximately
one-third of the herds, dairymen used a thermometer
to take the body temperature of sick calves; in these
herds, mortality was 1.6% less than in those herds Where
dairymen did not take the body temperature of sick
calves. This difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.
Diarrhea (in 70% of the herds) and pneumonia (in
41% of the herds) were the principal causes of calf
deaths.

Antibiotics were used prophylactically and thera-
peutically in raising calves in approximately 50% of the
herds; mortality was signiﬁcantly greater in these herds
(P < 0.05) than in herds where antibiotics were not
used. A combination of penicillin and dihydrostrepto-
mycin was the most widely used antibiotic (50% of the
herds) followed by neomycin, 20%; sulfonamides, 20%;
tetracyclines, 15%; and nitrofurazone, 5%.

Mortality according to type of person responsible
for the feeding of neonatal calves was wife, 16.6%;
owner, 18%; son or daughter, 18.2%; and hired man,
19.9%. None of these differences were statistically
signiﬁcant.

Discussion

Two periods appear critical to successful calf raising:
(1) birth and (2) the ﬁrst 14 days of life. These two
periods accounted for 14.9% of the calf mortality in this
study.

In this survey and in another study,10 calf mortality
was signiﬁcantly greater in the larger herds. In an ex-
pansion program, the number of cows and milking fa-
cilities might be enlarged without changes in calf-raising
facilities or labor. Increases in population density of
animals in the larger herds might also contribute to
spread of bacterial and viral infections. Inadequate
planning, overcrowding, lack of colostrum feeding, poor
ventilation, and labor shortages seemed to be the most
common problems associated with larger herds and high
calf mortality.

Calf mortality at birth was 3 to 4% even in herds
having total calf mortality'below 7%. When dairymen
that experienced greater than 10% calf mortality at
birth were questioned about the causes, most frequently
cows near parturition were not observed for periods
greater than 12 hours. Also, very few cows were assisted
during parturition by these same dairymen. Because
many dairymen do not count deaths at birth when tab-
ulating calf mortality, it is likely that dairymen under-
estimate total calf mortality at least 4%.

Impressions were that most dairymen surveyed did
not utilize colostrum effectively. Early ingestion of
colostrum is important in the prevention of fatal septi-
cemia due to Escherichia coli.4»9 Our data suggested
that the feeding of colostrum for more than 3 days was
associated with decreased calf mortality.

The most likely interpretation of the data on the
use of antibiotics is that antibiotics are used in an at-
tempt to solve the problems. The proper use of anti-
biotics is helpful in raising calves; however, if calves
have not been given colostrum, antibiotics do not prevent

CLINICAL ITEM

 

Bovine Abortion Associated with Candida tropicalis

AN ABORTED BOVINE fetus of approximately 6 months gestation was
submitted to the South Dakota Animal Disease Research and Diag-
nostic Laboratory. This was the ﬁrst abortion during the last 24
months in a herd of 60 Holstein-Friesian cows vaccinated for brucel-
losis. Clinical signs of disease were not observed in the dam prior to
or after the abortion.

Gross examination of the fetus revealed postmortem degenera-
tion, with blood-tinged ﬂuid in the thoracic and abdominal cavities
and blood-tinged subcutaneous and perirenal edema. The fetal mem-
branes had thickening of the allantochorion and adventitious pla-
centation; the caruncles were partially attached to the cotyledons.

Culture of the abomasal contents and specimens of placenta on
Sabouraud’s agar (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) at 37 C. for 24 hours
yielded a heavy growth of a yeastlike organism. Its size, morphologic
features, assimilation, and fermentation patterns conformed to those
of Candida tropicalis.4

Attempts to isolate or demonstrate other infectious agents
yielded negative results.

Histologic examination of the fetal organs did not reveal any
pathologic changes. Inﬂammation and necrosis of the arcade zone
(Fig. 1) with numerous pyknotic cells and neutrophils were seen on
microscopic examination of sections of placentomes. Numerous
ovoid, periodic acid-Schiﬂ-positive bodies, approximately 5 to 9 ,u in
length, were associated with the lesions of inﬂammation in the pla-
cental villi (Fig. 2) and vessels.

Serologic Evidence of Naturally Occurring Venezuelan
Equine Encephalomyelitis Virus Infection in a Dog

ON JULY 13, 1971, a 9-week-old female Doberman Pinscher was admitted
for examination because of an acute onset of epileptiform convulsions. Prior
to development of the condition, the dog was clinically normal. She had
been vaccinated for distemper and hepatitis (Virogen D-H, Pitman-Moore)
on June 14, 1971.

At admission, the dog’s rectal temperature was 105 F. (40.6 C.); after
administration of an antipyretic (Analate, National Laboratories), the tem-
perature decreased to 102 F. (38.9 C.). The dog was anesthetized (Nem-
butal, Abbott Laboratories) and kept completely sedated for about 48 hours.
During the next 8 days of hospitalization, the dog appeared to have lost all
vision and was periodically depressed, but she gradually improved and re-
gained vision; she was released on July 23. Due to continued listlessness she
was hospitalized again for 9 days beginning August 7. At this time, general
supportive care, an anthelmintic, and vitamins were given.

On October 14, convulsions recurred; some lasted as long as 5 minutes.
An anticonvulsant (Mylepsin, Fort Dodge Laboratories) was administered
at a dosage of 250 mg. both morning and night for 10 days. Continued
treatment at a dosage of 250 mg. per day for an additional 20 days seemed
to afford improvement but hyperexcitability persisted. On December 28,
convulsions occurred in spite of treatment and the dog was euthanatized on
December 31.

Blood samples had been collected on July 19 and September 14. Serums
from the samples were extracted with acetone and tested by hemagglutina-
tion-inhibition (HI) tests, using hemagglutinating antigens for western equine
encephalitis (WEE) virus, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, and Ven-
ezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) virus. The ﬁrst serum had a titer
of 1:160 and the second serum had a titer of 1:40 against VEE virus antigen.
Neither serum inhibited WEE or EEE virus antigens.

The 2 serums were also tested for neutralizing antibody against a VEE
virus isolated from a horse in Texas during the 1971 VEE epizootic. The test

was performed, using weanling white mice inoculated intracerebrally. The
amount of Virus neutralized by the ﬁrst serum was equal to or greater than
1.9 logm. There was insufﬁcient serum to determine the exact amount neu-
tralized. The amount of virus neutralized by the second serum was equal
to or greater than 3.0 loglo. .

The HI titer of 1:160 in the serum taken 6 days after onset of Signs was
believed to be indicative of recent infection with VEE virus. The fourfold
decrease in titer in the serum taken 63 days after onset of signs would nor-
mally be expected with such an infection. The results of the neutralization
tests indicated that the dog had been infected with VEE virus. The dog had
been free to roam in an area where VEE was enzootic.

Neutralizing antibodies against VEE virus in serum of dogs have been
reported,3 and the disease has been induced with large inoculums of virus
in 6—month—old dogs”!4

The clinical and serologic ﬁndings of this report may be considered by
some as inconclusive or inadequate evidence that the illness in the dog was
caused solely by VEE virus. Regrettably, specimens for histopathologic and
clinicop-athologic studies were not collected. Nevertheless, we believe our
interpretation of the serologic ﬁndings is valid. Further investigation of the
role of VEE virus as a cause of naturally occurring disease in dogs is war-
ranted.———J. E. Habluetzel, D.V.M., Ingleside, Texas 78362; J. E. Grimes,

Remedy for Unsuccessful Urethrostomy

CLOSURE OF THE surgical opening as a complication following perineal
urethrostomy to relieve male cats with urethral obstruction can be remedied
by further surgical treatment.

To correct such a complication, make a circumscribed incision in the
normal skin about 1/8 to M1 inches (0.3 to 0.6 cm.) back from the area where
the previous surgical Opening was made. Then grasp unwanted granulom-
atous, scar, or necrotic tissue, pull it out, and cut it off with a scissors. Do
not allow the urethra to withdraw into the pelvic area. Suture normal skin
to normal urethral tissue.

Factors Associated with Calf Mortality in Michigan Dairy Herds

J, A. Speicher, Ph.D., and R. E. Hepp, Ph.D.

SUMMARY

Records and results of a questionnaire from 379
Michigan dairy farms were studied to determine char-
acteristics that might be associated with calf mortality.

Annual calf mortality for all herds averaged 13.5%.
Winter and summer death losses were 17.1 and 10.3%,
respectively. Mortality increased as herd size in-
creased—from 9.7% for herds of less than 25 cows to
16.6% for herds of more than 85 cows. Differences in
mortality due to herd size were statistically signiﬁcant
(P < 0.01).

Of all calves that died, 47% died at birth; this
death loss was unrelated to herd size. Mortality after
birth was a function of herd size, with the greatest death
losses (4.1%) occurring during the ﬁrst week.

Mortality was signiﬁcantly less (P < 0.01) in
stanchion barns (12.0%) than in loose- and free-stall
housing (15.1 and 14.2%, respectively). An interaction
existed between herd size and type of housing.

Other characteristics shown to signiﬁcantly (P <
0.01) affect calf mortality were temperature of freshen-
ing facilities, type of housing for calves, supplemental
heat in calf barns, person caring for calves, and atten-
dance at freshening.

 

A 1965 ELECTRONIC farm account records (Telfarm)
summary on 281 southern Michigan dairy farms1 re-
vealed 14.8% calf mortality prior to weaning. Calf
mortality increased from a mean of 11.9% in herds with
less than 30 cows to a mean of 18.4% in herds with
100 cows or more. The summary did not provide in-
formation that would explain the high death rate .on
these farms, nor did it provide reasons for the increasmg
death rate as size of operation increased.

The present study was initiated to determine the
Characteristics of Michigan dairy farms that were as-
sociated with increased calf mortality and the conditions
under which death losses most frequently occur.

cern derived from Telfarm records was size of herd,
farm location, number of cows freshening, number of
calves that died prior to weaning, and calf mortality.
Births, deaths, and calf mortality were reported on a
quarterly basis. Computation of calf mortality included
calves born dead as well as those that died before
weaning.

A mail survey was sent in the fall of 1966 to the
760 Telfarm cooperators with dairy cows. Of this num-
ber 379 questionnaires were returned. Returned ques-
tionnaires were completed in varying degrees, with some
dairymen neglecting or unable to answer some of the
queries.

Annual and quarterly calf mortality reported by
respondents were judged to be representative of the
total sample. The questions included in the mail survey
related to 4 general categories: (1) age at which calves
died, (2) housing characteristics, (3) feeding regimen,
and (4) management practices.

Chi-square analysis was used to evaluate differences
in calf mortality. Calf mortality was originally analyzed
on a quarterly basis but later was converted to a sea-
sonal comparison when quarters 1 and 4 as well as 2
and 3 were found to be comparable in calf mortality.
The winter period then became October through March
and the summer period, April through September.

Results and Discussion

Herd Size.—-—Herds were grouped according to num-
ber of cows (Table 1). As herd size increased, annual
calf mortality increased—from 9.7% for herds of less

ity associated with herd size were signiﬁcant (P < 0.01)
for the winter period as well as on an annual basis.
There were no signiﬁcant differences in summer calf
mortality as herd size increased, nor was a trend
apparent.

Cooperators were asked for a breakdown of the age
at which calves died. The questions required a sophisti—
cation of records lacked by some. Completion of the
question also carried a greater time requirement than
other questions in the survey. Consequently only 210
(55%) of the 379 questionnaires carried a breakdown
on the age at which calves died. Responses on age at
which calves died and the relationship to herd size are
given (Table 2).

* Signiﬁcant trend (P <0.01) in calf mortality, with herd size, for the
1st and 2nd weeks.

There did not seem to be any relationship between
herd size and calf mortality at birth. The mean per-
centage of deaths at birth (including stillbirths and
death at or immediately following birth) was 6.3%.
The variation around this mean was unrelated to size
of herd.

Calf mortality during the 1st week increased from
1.7% for herds of less than 25 cows to more than 5%
for herds of more than 55 cows. Mortality for the 2nd
week was also a function of herd size, but with lower
magnitude and less dramatic differences than for week
1.

Data are somewhat misleading because deaths at
birth represented both male and female calves and, for
the greater part, 1st-week losses are also for both sexes.
Generally, bull calves are sold at about this time and
subsequent deaths are for remaining heifers; one might
speculate that mortality would be approximately 3%
greater if an attempt were made to raise calves of
both sexes to weaning age.

Major points derived from the summary on age at
death were: (1) calf mortality was approximately 6%
at birth, which was... not a function of herd size; (2) the
greatest period of hazard to the calf that was born alive
was the 1st week, and hazard increased as size of herd
increased.

There were 337 herds of Holstein-Friesian cattle,
28 herds of Jersey and Guernsey cattle, and 14 herds of
cattle of mixed breeding in the study. Herds of Jersey
and Guernsey cattle had slightly higher calf mortality
than did Holstein-Friesian herds, but differences were
not signiﬁcant.

ferences (P < 0.01) in annual and winter calf mortality
among cattle according to type of housing for the dairy
herd (Table 3). Differences were particularly obvious
during the winter menths, when herds in stanchion barns
and switch (combination stanchion and loose housing)
arrangements had death losses of 14.7 and 14.0% as
compared with 18.6 and 19.0% for herds in loose- and
free-stall housing. An interaction between housing sys-
tem and herd size was apparent. Herds in the housing
system with lower calf mortality were also smaller. The
stanchion and switch barns had an average of 36.4 and
43.8 cows, respectively, whereas the loose- and free-stall
units averaged 49.0 and 56.0 cows, respectively.

A similar interaction problem occurred when tem-
perature of freshening facilities was correlated with calf
mortality. For the 191 herds where the temperature of
freshening facilities was approximately the same as out-
side temperatures, there were winter and annual death
losses of 19.6 and 15.4%, respectively, and an average
herd size of 51.8 cows. For the 168 herds where cows
freshened in heated facilities, there were winter and
annual death losses of 13.6 and 10.9%, respectively,
with an average herd size of 38.3 cows. All differences
were signiﬁcant (P < 0.01). Of the herds with heated
freshening facilities, 10% received this heat from a sup-
plemental heater, whereas 90% derived supplemental
heat via association with other animals. Calf mortality
was comparable for both groups.

The relationship between type of calf housing and
calf mortality is given (Table 4). When calves were
housed in a stanchion barn with the cow herd, calf
mortality for the winter period was 13.0 % compared with
189% for herds with calves in a separate barn or in a
part of the loose housing barn. Annual calf mortality
was 3.9 and 5.5% greater when calves were housed in
a separate barn or in a part of the loose housing barn,

respectively, than for those in stanchion barns with the
cow herd.

significant differences (P < 0.01) in calf mortality between geographic
location, for both annual and seasonal data.

There was signiﬁcantly less calf mortality among
herds provided with supplemental heat in the barn
housing the calves than among those not provided with
heat. Winter and annual calf death losses were 15.9
and 12.7%, respectively, in the 195 herds in which
supplemental heat was provided. For the 176 herds
where supplemental heat was not supplied, winter and
annual calf death losses were 18.6 and 14.6% respec-
tively. Differences were signiﬁcant (P < 0.01).

Calf mortality was less in northern Michigan than
in the southern portions of the state (Table 5). Winter
death losses were 18.2 and 11.5%, respectively, for
southern and northern Michigan, and summer death
losses for the 2 regions were 11.0 and 5.6%, respectively.

Lower death losses in a more extreme winter climate
require more detailed examination and explanation. An
interaction existed between region and herd size but it
would be difficult to attribute the total difference in
calf mortality to increased herd size. A 10-cow difference
in herd size between northern and southern Michigan——
37 .1 and 47.5, respectively—was accompanied by a 5.8%
difference in annual calf mortality—8.6 and 14.4%,
respectively. A decided difference in dairy housing exists
between the 2 regions (Table 6). Southern Michigan
has a higher percentage of loose and free—stall housing
systems, more outside freshening, fewer instances where
calves are housed in the barn with the cow herd, and
less warm calf housing. Herds in northern Michigan
more closely follow the norm of a slightly earlier era——
a stanchion barn that includes facilities for freshening
and raising calves to weaning age. _

The study shows that smaller herds in stanchion
barns have less calf mortality. Three primary factors

may account for this phenomenon: (1) Stanchion en-
vironment is conducive to minimal calf mortality—
freshening facilities were heated and calf barns were
warm; (2) dairymen do not provide adequate facilities
for freshening and young stock as they phase into free-
stall housing and larger herds; (3) management is
spread over greater numbers of cattle and consequently
is less than optimal.

Management Practices.—The relationship between
the person caring for the calves and calf mortality (Table

increased the effects of good herd management were
diluted. If the operator cared for or supervised care of
the calves, winter, summer, and annual calf death losses
were at approximately 16, 10, and 13%, respectively.
Calf mortality losses increased sharply when responsibil-
ity for calf care was delegated to hired labor—winter,
summer, and annual calf death losses of 28.1, 12.4, and
20.1%, respectively. Calf mortality was reduced by
approximately 1% when the mother or wife of the
operator assumed responsibility for calf care (Table 7).

Questions asked in regard to sanitation included:
(1) Was disinfection of navels practiced routinely? (2)
How often were feeding pails disinfected? and (3) How
often were pens disinfected? The practice of disinfecting
navels, pails, or pens, which most dairymen did not
normally do, did not signiﬁcantly affect calf mortality.

Questions asked regarding the frequency of use of
a veterinarian and the establishment of a disease-
prevention program in cooperation with the veterinarian
indicated that veterinarians are not normally utilized
until a mortality problem develops. -

Use of individual pens until weaning had no measur-
able effect on calf mortality. Equal numbers of dairy-
men raised calves in individual pens and in group pens.
Mean herd size for the 2 groups was 47.9 and 43.5 cows,
respectively. Winter, summer, and annual death losses
for dairymen utilizing individual pens were 17.0, 10.7,
and 13.6%, respectively, and were 17.4, 9.4, and 13.3%,
respectively, for dairy operations where calves were
raised in group pens. .

Dairymen were asked if they made it a practlce for
someone to be present when cows freshened. Mean calf
mortality for dairymen responding “yes” and “no” was

12.8 and 14.4%, respectively. This difference was signif-
icant (P < 0.01).

Feeding Regimen—The length of time a calf was
allowed to nurse its dam did not have an effect on calf
mortality. Of the dairymen, 23% did not permit the
calf to nurse, another 39% removed the calf within 24
hours, 14% removed the calf by the 2nd day, 20%
at the 3rd day, and only 4% indicated that they left
the calf with the cow for more than 3 days.

CLINICAL

 

There were no signiﬁcant differences in calf mortality
between the feeding of milk until weaning age (point at
which calves no longer receive some form of a milk
product) vs. starting on milk and later changing to milk
replacer, or us. milk replacer immediately after feeding
of colostrum. Of the respondents, 20% fed milk until
weaning age and another 27% began to feed milk re-
placer immediately after the feeding of colostrum,
whereas 53% started calves on milk and switched to
milk replacer.

Pharyngeal Rupture in a Horse

A 1-YEAR-OLD Quarter Horse ﬁlly was admitted to the
University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine
with a 1-week history of inability to swallow food or
drink water. Just prior to the onset of this condition
the owner had administered a trichlorfon bolus (Dyrex,
Fort Dodge) with a balling gun.

At physical examination, the horse was moderately
dehydrated and in poor body condition. Palpation of
the esophageal groove and pharynx did not demonstrate
the bolus. A stomach tube was easily passed into the
stomach. As the ﬁlly attempted to drink, deglutition
was not observed, and water came out of both nostrils.
Movements of the tongue appeared normal. Endoscopic
examination revealed extreme hyperemia of the entire
pharyngeal cavity. A lateral radiograph of the laryn-
geal-pharyngeal region was taken with the horse in a
standing position. Examination of the radiograph re-
vealed numerous areas of gas in the soft tissue in the
pharyngeal area and extending into the anterior esopha-
geal area (Fig. 1), indicating ruptured pharyngeal
mucosa.

The horse was placed on a regimen of supportive
therapy, including administration via stomach tube of
a complete diet substitute (Amijex, Diamond Labora-
tories), water, and oral electrolytes. Antibiotics and
corticosteroids were given to control infection and in-

The distance between these openings was about the
length of the anthelmintic bolus; they were believed to
have developed as a consequence of transverse lodgment
of the bolus in the pharynx. This case demonstrates the
potential danger in this type of anthelmintic therapy

Retinal Degeneration in Kittens

Lionel F. Rubin, V.M.D., and David E. Lipton, D.V.M.

SUMMARY

Diffuse outer segment retinal degeneration was found
in 2 Persian kittens in each of 2 successive litters by 15
weeks of age. Clinical signs were mydriasis, tapetal hy-
perreﬂectivity, retinal vascular attenuation, and abnor-
malities in visual behavior. The disease seemed to be
inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait.

 

DIFFUSE RETINAL degenerations have been reported in
cats as a sporadic disease of unknown cause, and as a
result of apparent nutritional deﬁciencies}3 The possi-
bility that diffuse retinal degeneration might be an in-
herited disease remains problematic. Affected cats have
been sexually mature in all instances. A survey of case
records of 9 cats with diffuse retinal degeneration ad-
mitted to our clinic between 1963 and July, 1971, indi-
cates the age at admission was 1 to 10 years. All but
one cat was more than 3 years old. Preliminary ﬁndings
on an apparently inherited retinal degeneration in Per-
sian kittens are contained in this report.

Clinical Data
After reporting occasional blind kittens in a ‘cat
breeding program, a cat fancier presented for examlna-

tion a 6-year-old black Persian tomcat, a 4-year-old
cream queen, and their litter of six 6—week-old kittens.
The litter contained 4 males and 2 females (Fig. 1), the
coat colors including red, cream, blue cream, and tort01se-
shell. Ophthalmoscopic examination failed to reveal ab-
normalities in either the torn, queen, or any of the litter.
Most of the litter was sold. Six weeks later one of the
tortoiseshell female kittens that had been retained by the
breeder began to behave as though she had difﬁculty
seeing. She would bump into objects her littermates
avoided and appeared cautious in her movements.
Shortly after, a red male kitten was returned to the
breeder because of similar behavior.

When examined at 15 weeks of age, the 2 abnormal
kittens had normal pupillary responses to light stimula-
t1on, but the pupillary diameter was wider than those
of the 4 unaffected kittens, which were also exammed.
Increases in tapetal reﬂectivity and in tapetal granu-
larity and a decrease in caliber of the retinal vasculature
COllld be seen ophthalmoscopically in the affected klt-
tens. Vascular thinning ranging from one- to two-thirds

A repeat breeding was made, and the 2nd litter con-
sisted of 4 females and 2 males (Fig. 1). By 12 weeks
of age a tortoiseshell female and cream male had mod-
erate mydriasis, were excessively cautious compared to
their littermates when allowed to roam free in an un-
familiar environment, and ophthalmoscopically appeared
identical to the abnormal kittens of the ﬁrst litter (Fig.
2). This litter, as well as the parents and the ﬁrst litter,
had been reared on commercially available cat foods,a
wheat germ, brewer’s yeast, and a vitamin supplement.”

All cats were in excellent physical condition. Sys-
temic abnormalities were not detected.

An eye was enucleated from a normal and an ab-
normal kitten of the 2nd litter. The eyes were ﬁxed in

sectioned. Histologically, abnormalities were found in
the outer segment of the retina (Fig. 3). The layer of
rod and cone processes was reduced to stubby rem-
nants, and the outer nuclear layer was thinned to one-
third normal thickness. The outer plexiform layer was
half as thick as normal. The inner nuclear and inner
plexiform layers were normal, as was the ganglion cell
layer. Muller’s ﬁbers were prominent in the nerve ﬁber
layer of the abnormal cat.

The pigment cell layer, tapetum, and choroid were

normal.

Discussion

Diffuse outer segment retinal atrophy characterized
by the ophthalmoscopic and histologic appearance seen
in the affected kittens of this report has been induced
in cats maintained on synthetic dietsl’3 that contained
casein as the principal source of protein. In one study,3
retinal degeneration developed within 6 to 20 months
andwas not inﬂuenced by concurrent oral administra-

tion; and formation of cataracts. In a similar study,2
parenterally administered vitamin A also failed to avert
retinal degeneration. In both studies, affected cats were
thin and in generally poor condition while maintained
on the synthetic diet. The kittens of this report ap-

peared to be in excellent physical condition, as did their
parents maintained on the same diet. We believe it un-
likely that inadequate nutrition was the primary cause
of retinal degeneration in the kittens.

Diffuse retinal degeneration has also been reported2
as a sporadic disease of mature cats. Otherwise healthy
mature cats are noticed by their owners to have mydrl-
asis and to be overly cautious in their movements. Oph‘
thalmoscopically, the tapetum is greatly hyperreﬂectlve
and the retinal vessels extremely attenuated. Histolog'
ically there is a complete atrophy of the outer segmen.t
of the retina. The disease is usually recognized and fil-
agnosed in the late stages of development. Cats W}th
this disease seen at our clinic have been fed a Wlde
variety of seemingly complete diets. In a few instances,
affected cats and normal cats in the same home were
fed identical diets.

The cats of this report developed the abnormality by
15 weeks of age, considerably earlier than did those C?Its
examined in our clinic and elsewhere.‘~’ Affected CatS

fected for some time prior to examination, but it seems
unlikely that the owner would not have noticed the
mydriasis and behavioral aberrations earlier. The signs
of visual difﬁculty in the kittens of this report were ob-
vious to an owner who had no prior experience with cats,
by .4 months of age. The different times of ﬁrst detec-
tion suggest that the kittens of this report developed a
different type of degeneration, although all types appar-
ently are similar at the end stage. Because the abnor-
mality developed in a few kittens in 2 successive litters,
we suggest the abnormality is inherited, probably as a
simple autosomal recessive factor.

Though the relationship of diet to the deveIOpment
of disease was not determined in this study, it seems

unlikely that the diet was nutritionally inadequate, inas-
much as older cats had been fed a similar diet for many
years without developing retinal degeneration and only
one-third of each litter developed the problem. This
does not preclude the possibility that the affected kit-
tens were unable to. assimilate food normally, which
would again argue for an inherited defect.

Aeromonas hydrophila Septicemia in a Dog

A DEAD 14-month-old Pointer was submitted to the South Dakota Animal
Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory. Convulsions, anorexia, and
emaciation were observed prior to its death.

Necropsy revealed depletion of fat depots throughout the carcass and

marked congestion and hypertrophy of the tonsils. The gastrointestinal
tract was empty; the mucosa of the small intestine was thickened, and a
small amount of blood-tinged mucoid exudate was present. The liver and
kidneys appeared congested.
.t Bacteriologic culture of specimens of spleen, kidney, liver, and tonsil
on blood agar for 24 hours at 37 C. yielded a pure culture of Aeromonas
hydrophila. Bacteriologic culture of intestinal mucosa on blood agar yielded
A. hydrophila and nonhemolytic Escherichia coli.

Specimens of spleen, liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, and lung were ﬁxed
in 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Microscopic
examination revealed lymphoid depletion and mild hemosiderosis in the
spleen, collagenous material in the portal triads of the liver, and marked
reticuloendothelial hyperplasia of the mesenteric lymph nodes. The lungs
appeared normal.

Diet and the Performance of Racing Sled Dogs

D. S. Kronfeld, M.V.Sc., Ph.D.

SUMMARY

A group of 16 racing sled dogs were performing
poorly. After 2 to 8 miles of running well, individual
dogs would suddenly slacken and develop an awkward
gait and stiff hindlimbs. All practiced coprophagy.

Concentrations of blood glucose in 2 dogs after an
18-hour fast were 50and 56 mg./ 100 ml. Of the gross
energy in the diet, 29, 32, and 39% was in the form of
protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Total daily
energy intake per dog was 1,700 kcal., i.e., 1.23 times
maintenance requirement (M). The condition was ten-
tatively attributed to excessive carbohydrate intake.

The diet was changed in 3 steps at approximately
2-week intervals. The ﬁrst 2 steps were substitutions of
horsemeat for isocaloric amounts of dry food, thus re-
ducing carbohydrate content to 28%, then 22% of
dietary energy. The 3rd was a complete shift to a forti-
ﬁed chicken and chicken-parts product containing
negligible carbohydrate. Coprophagy ceased within a
few days of the ﬁrst change and the running performance
of the dogs improved with each change.

After 2 to 3 weeks on the chicken diet, the dogs
raced well, having good stamina in a 3-day racing event.
The chicken product contained 34 and 66% energy as
protein and fat, respectively. It was fed at a high level
(peak of 2.25 M and average of 1.78 M) for 9 weeks.
Clinical signs of disease were not observed. Results of
blood analysis for glucose, acetoacetate, urea, creatinine,
and amylase were normal.

 

PROLONGED STRENUOUS muscular activity commonly
raises the daily energy turnover of sled dogs to twice
the amount required to maintain body weight at rest,
i.e., twice maintenance (2 M), and up to 3 M in cold
environs?2 Food intake of sled dogs is correspondingly
enormous. Inasmuch as excessive food intakes tend to
diminish the efﬁciency of digestion, it is not surprising
that sled dogs in training often have soft feces or frank
diarrhea.

The fat content in rations of sled dogs is usually high

(digestibility) was 93% for the seal meat and 85 and
72% for the other 2 products. Diarrhea commonly
occurred in dogs fed a product that had a protein
digestibility of only 70%.22

Trainers of racing sled dogs in North America usually
feed mixtures of cereal and meat, with corn oil added
according to work performed. Some trainers have
recently increased the carbohydrate content of the ra-
tion, following the demonstration that the human ca-
pacity for prolonged exercise is enhanced after eating
a diet rich in carbohydrate.16 This improvement in
human performance has been attributed to higher muscle
glycogen content. The results of other studies on man10
are inconsistent with these ﬁndings, however, and their
applicability to dogs has yet to be conﬁrmed. It is
commonly thought that carbohydrate (in the form of
glucose and glycogen) is the preferred energy source
for working muscle in man. During work in dogs, how-
ever, glucose oxidation accounts for only 10 to 15% 0f
the energy expenditure, whereas plasma-free fatty acids
supply 70 to 90% of the energy expenditure durlng
prolonged strenuous exercise.23

This report is concerned with a situation in whiCh
P001r performance of racing dogs was associated with high
carbohydrate intake. Improvement followed progreSSive
changes to lower carbohydrate intakes. The dogs ﬁnally
reached a high standard of performance when fed a
zero-carbohydrate ration.

Case Presentation

- A group of sixteen 2- to 6-year-old sled dogs had a
h1story of poor running performance that was said to .re-
semble “tying up” in horses. The dogs were Siberlan
or Alaskan Huskies with some infusion of German Shep‘

of running well in harness, individual dogs would sud-
denly slacken and develOp an awkward gait and stiff
hindlimbs. Slight weaving and apparent loss of control
of hindquarters while running often became more pro-
nounced for 5 to 10 minutes‘afterward. The dogs were
worked every 2nd or 3rd day. The condition had been
observed for 10 weeks; it now afﬂicted all the dogs and
was becoming more frequent and severe.

Clinical Examination—The dogs were examined at
their kennels at Exton, Pa. A11 appeared to be in a lean
and ﬁt condition. Rectal temperatures and respiratory
and heart rates were normal. Each of 8 dogs had a large
swelling on a hindlimb, apparently resulting from a 1-ml.
injection of a vitamin preparation" into the gastrocne-
mius muscle. Feces were well formed. Five dogs were
observed eating feces. Coprophagy was said to be a gen-
eral problem. Otherwise the dogs appeared clinically
normal. Blood samples taken from 2 dogs after they
were fasted for 18 hours revealed glucose concentrations
of 50 and 56 mg./100 ml.

Diet—The dogs’ feeding regimen was a single meal
each evening. The diet was a mixture of a dry product,
horsemeat, and corn oil (diet I, Table 2). In addition,
each dog was given 1 teaspoonful of a vitamin-mineral
supplement each day." The dry feed and horsemeat had
been analyzed" and this permitted calculation of the
protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the diet and the total
energy intake (Table 2).

racehorses. Two features of the diet, the corn oil and
the relatively high carbohydrate content, were consid-
ered to potentially contribute to such a condition.

Some horses that “tie up” intermittently are pro-
tected by the parenteral administration of preparations
containing selenium and vitamin E.14 Excessive intakes
of polyunsaturated fatty acids induce several forms of
conditioned Vitamin E deﬁciency.12 For example, pigs
fed corn oil develop skeletal muscle degeneration.30 For
these or similar reasons, the trainer had administered a
vitamin E preparation 7 days earlier, but without bene-
ﬁcial effect. It was concluded that the problem in these
dogs was not due to a conditioned Vitamin E deﬁciency.

“Tying up” in horses is often regarded as a relatively
mild form of myoglobinuria. The classic theory of the
pathogenesis of this disease associates excessive carbo-
hydrate (grain) intake with rest. On the resumption of
work, overproduction of lactic acid from accumulated
muscle glycogen is thought to lead to intracellular and
local acidosis, which damages muscle cells. The feeding
and working pattern of these sled dogs ﬁt this develop-
mental pattern of “Monday-morning disease” in horses.

Two other features of the condition were consistent
with excessive carbohydrate intake. Coprophagy has
been associated with high carbohydrate intakes, espe-
cially in German Shepherd Dogs.19 The moderate hy-
poglycemia perhaps was an exaggerated third phase of
the blood glucose response to a high carbohydrate meal,
i.e., a mild form of functional hypoglycemia. This con-
dition is not well documented in dogs, tho-ugh it may be
involved in Beagles that develop convulsions while hunt-
ing. Such dogs often have been fed high carbohydrate
diets; variable success has followed a change to a high
protein diet.20

Dietary Changes

The initial recommendation was to diminish the car-
bohydrate content of the diet from 39% to 28%, then
to 22%, at 2-week intervals by replacing part of the dry
food with an isocaloric amount of horsemeat. The ﬁrst
response was dramatic—the coprophagy ceased in a few
days. The trainer observed that stamina improved
progressively as less dietary carbohydrate was offered.
In View of this ﬁnding and those of others?2 a second
recommendation was made to shift the diet to one of
95% meat and meat byproducts fortiﬁed to meet the
National Research Council’s recommended minimal
amounts of essential nutrients.1

At this point, blood samples were taken from the 7
most compliant dogs after they were fasted for 16 to 18
hours. Packed cell volume, glucose,9 acetoacetate,32
betahydroxybutyrate,34 and blood urea nitrogen2 (BUN)
were measured. Results are given (Table 3).

A commercial chicken productd was substituted for
the horsemeat in diet II (Table 2) for 4 days, then fed
exclusively, increasing in 10 days to 2.25 M (diet III).
Loose, pasty, or fatty feces were produced when more
than 2.5 or 3 cans (1.5—2 M) were fed as a single meal.
This problem was overcome by dividing the daily diet

into 2 meals.

An average of 3.6 cans was fed for 2 weeks prior to
the second sampling of blood. The only change was a
slight but signiﬁcant increase in BUN content (Table 3).

Further improvement in stamina was reported by
the trainer. The dogs ran consistently well under ardu-
ous conditions in a professional 3-day event, with a 20-
to 30-mile race on each day. A week later the team again
performed well in a 2-day event. The second set of blood
samples was taken between these events.

The food intake was limited progressively as the
work diminished until it reached an average of 1.9 cans
per day (diet IV, Table 2). After a total of 9 weeks on
the chicken diet, a third set of blood samples was taken.
The BUN concentration had returned to the initial level.
Serum concentration of creatinine was measured by the
J a'ffé reaction, and serum amylase activity by an amylo-
lytic method.28 Results are given (Table 3). The dogs
maintained their body weight on the chicken diet.

Discussion

The appearance of “tying up,” the coprophagy, and
the hypoglycemia of the dogs all suggested excessive
dietary carbohydrate. The immediate correction of the
coprophagy, the restoration of normal blood glucose con-
centrations, and the progressive increase in stamina on
lowering of the carbohydrate intake supported the
diagnosis.

The National Research Council’s recommendations
for canine nutrition consist of minimal amounts of es-
sential nutrients, with 2 exceptions—optimal energy in-
takes for maintenance and growth and a carbohydrate
maximum of 65% dry matter.1 The latter standard is
equivalent to 52% carbohydrate on an energy basis
when the protein intake is the recommended minimum.
The present observations suggest that the carbohydrate
maximum should be less than 39% in racing sled dogs
fed 1.3 M energy. The improvement in running per-
formance after the dogs were shifted from 22% to zero
carbohydrate suggests that the optimal carbohydrate
intake lies in this region for high-performance dogs. A
prior comparison suggested that the optimal carbohy-
drate intake is between 13% and zero in sled dogs in
the Antarctic.22

It has been suggested that dogs may have an essen—
tial requirement for carbohydrate.24 Few pertinent data
are available for dogs; much more information is avail-
able on the minimum carbohydrate requirements of other
species. The extreme carnivores and extreme herbivores
(cats and ruminants) apparently do not have a nutrient
requirement for carbohydrate; they can synthesize all
the glucose required for cellular utilization”) The pres-
ent observations and those of others“ suggest that dogs
not fed any carbohydrate are also able to synthesize all
of the glucose required for cellular utilization from nu-
trient amino acids and glycerol, even when glucose syn-
thesis and utilization are increased by exercise.31 About
4% of dietary energy in the form of glucose or glycerol
from triglycerides (neutral fat) is sufﬁcient for growth
of chickens and rats, though this sparse amount of carbo-
hydrate may diminish glucose toleranceF'm'L’“ Human
beings shifted to a low carbohydrate diet require about
10% dietary energy in the form of carbohydrate to avert
ketosis and sodium depletion.20 This requirement abates
with time until the carbohydrate requirement ap-
proaches zero.8'17 Dogs are much more resistant than
man to ketosis when fasted and fed 100% olive oil.11
When carbohydrate content was shifted abruptly from
22% to zero, the dogs of the present study did not de-
velop ketosis. Indeed, the blood acetoacetate concentra-
tion approached zero in dogs fed 66% fat for 9 weeks.

A semisynthetic diet containing 77% fat, 15% car-
bohydrate, and only 8% protein induced pancreatitis in
11 of 13 dogs.18 Dogs with pancreatitis often have a his-
tory of consuming large amounts of fat." The 16 dogs
under observation here were fed a commercial product
with a 66% fat content at an average of nearly 2 M for
9 weeks without developing any clinical signs of pan-
creatitis. At the end of this period their serum amylase
activities ranged from 300 to 810 Somogyi units, well
within the normal range; activities of 2,000 units or
more would suggest pancreatitis.3

The protein content of the chicken product was 34%
(on an energy equivalent basis), a little less than the
average protein content (40% on an energy equivalent
basis) of 5 “all-meat” dog foods.‘27 The protein content
of these products has been described as “high” because,
allegedly, it is utilized inefﬁciently and is harmful to the
kidneys?“24 It is certainly higher than the minimum
protein intake of 20% recommended by the National
Research Council.1 Amounts of dietary protein equiV'
alent to 21 and 10% energy have maintained maximal
protein-deoxyribonucleic acid ratios in young and older
dOgS, respectively, and these amounts have been sug-
gested to be optimal.33 The Optimal protein intake for
dogs in regard to maximal efﬁciency of gains in body
energy or nitrogen has not been established. Studies 1n
rats, however, indicate the optimal dietary protein 0011‘
tent to be equivalent to 40% of digestible energy15
Thus, the protein content of “all—meat” dog foods and
in the chicken product used in the present study may
approach the optimum in regard to energetic efﬁciency

The indexes of renal function that diminish during
renal failure, e.g., renal blood ﬂow, glomerular ﬁltratlon
rate, and urea clearance, all increase when the diet 0f
normal dogs is shifted from a cereal diet to one of meat.26

The responses of dogs with senile renal changes or renal
failure to changes in dietary protein have not been doc-
umented critically. In the dogs of the present study,
BUN concentration increased, then decreased as protein
intake was raised then lowered, but it always remained
less than the BUN content in dogs with renal insuffi-
ciency.6 Similarly, the serum creatinine concentrations
of these dogs remained less than the amounts found
in dogs with compromised renal function.6

Hypertrophic Pulmonary Osteoarthropathy
in a Dog with Carcinoma of the Urinary Bladder

Robert S. Brodey, D.V.M., M.Sc.; Wayne H. Riser, D.V.M., M.Sc.; Henry Allen, V.M.D.

NUMEROUS CASES of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoar-
thrOpathy (HPO) in dogs have been reported?!5 Few of
these were associated with primary neoplasms of the
urinary bladder. The following case of HPO is reported
because of unusual clinical, radiographic, and pathologic
ﬁndings.

Case Report

A 9-year-old spayed female Chihuahua was referred
to the tumor clinic at the University of Pennsylvania
Veterinary Hospital on Sept. 7, 1971, because of
crippling enlargement of the limbs and chronic urinary
bladder disease.

The following information was supplied by the re-
ferring veterinarians.‘l In October, 1969, the dog was
treated for cystitis. She was again seen in October, 1970,
because of dysuria and hematuria. Radiographically,
small cystic calculi were observed. The dog was treated
intermittently with urinary medicaments until April,
1971. Inasmuch as the bitch’s urinary distress had
gradually worsened, a cystotomy was performed in May,
1971. The bladder wall was greatly thickened (0.6 cm.)
and indurated. The mucosal surface of the bladder was
lined by irregular strands of tissue, some of which con-
tained tiny calculi. The calculi were removed. Post-
surgical medication consisted of chloramphenicol. Uri-
nary Signs persisted despite treatment.

In August, 1971, swelling of the distal portions of
both hindlimbs was observed; 3 weeks later the distal
portions of all 4 limbs were enlarged. Bone changes
detected on radiography were typical of HPO; pulmonary
lesions were not detected. The bitch was referred to the
tumor clinic for further evaluation.

Results

Clinical Findings—On September 7, there was ﬁrm,
pulsatile enlargement of all 4 limbs, which contributed
to great difﬁculty in ambulation. Other ﬁndings included
a grade II holosystolic murmur characteristic of mitral
insufﬁciency, irregular thickening of the urinary bladder,
subcutaneous nodules in the caudal portion of the

laparotomy wound, and separation and nodular en-
largements of the costochondral junctions of left ribs
VII and VIII.

Radiographic Findings.—Changes associated with
HPO were extensive, involving all of the bones of the
limbs (Fig. 1) and pelvis (Fig. 2). Osteoproliferative
changes were seen on the ventral aspects of the sacral
and last 5 lumbar vertebrae (Fig. 3A). Smaller ir-
regular proliferative changes were seen in the ven-
tral aspects of the last 3 thoracic and ﬁrst 3 lumbar
vertebrae. Calluses were noticed on several ribs, and
right ribs VII and VIII were widely separated (Fig. 4).
The costochondral junctions of the more caudal ribs were
enlarged bilaterally. Abnormalities of the heart and
lungs were not visualized.

Laboratory Findings—Pertinent laboratory ﬁndings
were those of anemia (packed cell volume, 22%; Hb.,
8.6 Gm./ 100 m1.; red blood cells (RBC) , 3,220,000/cmm.)

and neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cells (WBC)
41,000/cmm., with 93% segmented and 4% non-
segmented neutrophils, 2% lymphocytes, and 1% mono-
cytes). There was also slight anisocytosis, polychromasia
with moderate hypochromia, and 4 nucleated RBC/ 100
WBC. Serum creatinine content was normal (0.44 mg./

number of bacteria.

Surgical Findings—An exploratory thoracotomy at
he right seventh interspace was performed, as pul-
monary lesions, usually neoplastic in origin, are the most
common cause of Hpo.2 A thin band of ﬁrm purplish
gray tissue was found on the caudal aspect of the right

removed for frozen section. Histologically, there were

numerous clumps of polygonal eosinophilic-staining cells,

thought to represent metastatic carcinoma (Fig. 5B).
The bitch was euthanatized and necropsied.

Gross and Microscopic Pathologic Findings.—
N odules associated with the laparotomy scar were com-
posed of ﬁrm, homogeneous, grayish tissue that adhered
to the urinary bladder. The wall of the bladder was
greatly thickened; the mucosal surface was covered by
friable, gray, papillary tumors. Both kidneys and ureters
were enlarged and distended with urine because of
neoplastic inﬁltration into both ureteral oriﬁces. The
caudal margins of the pulmonary lobes were slightly
rounded and studded with ﬁrm gray nodules 2 to 4 mm.
in diameter.

Histologically, the bladder mucosa was replaced by
large foamy polyhedral neoplastic cells with pleomorphic
nuclei. The cells varied in arrangement from well-formed
papillae with a delicate stroma, to a well-organized
glandular conﬁguration. The tumor was highly invasive
but mitotic ﬁgures were not abundant (Fig. 5A).

The adrenal cortices were hyperplastic and most of
the sinusoids of the zona reticularis contained metastatlc
tumor cells. Tumor cells were also within the enlarged
right costochondral junctions, medullary shafts of ribs
VII and VIII, liver (Fig. 5C), and kidneys (Fig- 5D)-
The tumors in the lungs and the laparotomy wound were
similar in appearance to the bladder tumor.

Hypertrophic new bone surrounded the bones of all
4 limbs. The new bony tissue was covered by highly
vascular, tough connective tissue. The new bone growth
bulged in irregular mounds from the original cortex,
making the affected forelimbs 3 cm. in diameter instea
of a normal size of 1 cm. The femurs had increased In
diameter to more than 2 cm. Hypertrophic new bone
and connective tissue grew around major vessels an
tendons without affecting their function. Only the nery
formed connective tissue was continuous across the
joints. The periosteum was raised and the new bone
extended perpendicularly from the original cortex aS ﬁne
lamellar trabeculae. Fibrous tissue occupied the space
between the perpendicular trabeculae. A third bony
layer extended from the “hair on end” trabeculae. Thls

bone was more dense in its development and was com-
posed of ﬁber-bone and some cartilage. Hypertrophic
new bone and connective tissue were also on the scapulae,
pelvis, sacrum, and last 4 lumbar vertebrae. The hy-
pertrophic bony and connective tissue proliferation of
the lumbar and sacral vertebrae extended along the
ventral and lateral aspects of the vertebral bodies, and
also involved the spinal and transverse processes. The
spinal canal was not encroached upon by this newly
formed tissue (Fig. 3B). Metastatic carcinoma was in
the hypertrophic connective tissue and new bone in-
volving the sacrum, caudal lumbar vertebrae, and some
of the vertebrae at the thoracolumbar area, but was not
in the hypertrOphic bony areas of the limbs, pelvis, or
cervical vertebrae.

The pathologic diagnosis was HPO and transitional
cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder with metastasis to
the lungs, liver, kidneys, ribs, adrenal glands, and
vertebrae. Recurrent carcinoma was in the abdominal
incision.

Discussion

Failure to demonstrate radiographic lesions in the
thorax made the etiopathogenesis of HPO in this bitch
rather obscure. The calluses on the right ribs and the
separation of ribs VII and VIII were initially thought to
be related to previous trauma. We brieﬂy considered
that pleural adhesions might have been present at the
site of ribs VII and VIII, as HPO was previously re-
ported in a mare with an old rib fracture and pleural
adhesions.6 It was later learned that, in 1966, the bitch
was kicked in the thorax. She probably sustained the
rib fracture and separation at this date.

We performed an exploratory thoracotomy to deter-
mine the nature of the rib lesions and the possibility of
lung metastases, as we have observed a number of dogs
with lung nodules too small to be detected radiograph-
ically. Further, it has been shown that 55 of 60 dogs
with HPO had metastatic or primary lung neoplasia.2

The lung lesions in this bitch were not typical of
most metastases to the lungs. Instead of discrete,
rounded nodules throughout the lung parenchyma,
lesions consisted of thin, ﬁrm, discolored areas along
the caudal border of the lobes. These subpleural lesions
appeared small and insigniﬁcant at the time of surgery
and might easily have been misinterpreted as old foci
of inﬂammation. The importance of the surgical biopsy
of this dog therefore cannot be overemphasized.

Initially, we considered that the vertebral and cos—
tochondral proliferations may have been part of the
Periosteal overgrowth so typical of HPO even though
Vertebral and rib involvement in HPO is exceedingly rare.
Histologic study of the vertebral column, however, in—
dicated widespread foci of carcinoma permeating the
Ventral vertebral veins, especially in the caudal lumbar
area. In the past, failure to examine the skeleton care-
fully, both radiographically and pathologically, has un-
doubtedly resulted in the erroneous impression that
OSseous metastases are rare in the dog.3

In 1940 the vertebral vein system was shown to be

March l5, I973

an important route for hematogenous spread of human
prostatic carcinoma.1 In 1968 it was reported that 7
of 20 dogs with prostatic carcinoma had radiographic
evidence of metastasis to caudal lumbar vertebrae and
pelvis.7 In the same year, vertebral metastasis was also
reported in 2 dogs with neoplasms of the urinary bladder,
one a transitional cell carcinoma, the other a ﬁbro-
sarcoma},8

The vertebral vein system represents an alternate
route for return of blood to the heart if the caudal vena
cava should collapse temporarily because of elevation
of intraabdominal pressure due to coughing or straining
to defecate or urinate. The vertebral vein plexuses lack
valves, and tumor emboli may spread either cranially
or caudally.

This bitch did not have any clinical signs of pul-
monary disease even though she had tiny foci of
metastasis in her lungs. The absence of pulmonary
signs is common in both man and dogs with HPO. In
a recent study of 60 dogs with HPO, only 8 had clinical
signs of respiratory tract disease prior to the onset of
HPO.2

The carcinomatous subcutaneous nodules that de-
veloped in the laparotomy incision of May, 1971,
probably arose from implantation of tumor cells during
the cystotomy. Clinically, mammary neoplasms were
ruled out because the nodules were subcutaneous.
Further, the bitch had been spayed at 1 year of age,
thus making mammary neoplasia extremely unlikely.4

Bladder neoplasms have been detected in a few dogs
with HPO. In 2 highly unusual cases, young giant breed
dogs with rhabdomyosarcomas of the bladder developed
HPO in the absence of any pulmonary lesions?’9

Cytologic examination of the urinary sediment is a
highly accurate technique for the detection of bladder
carcinoma and probably would have been diagnostic in
this bitch.

Pelvic involvement in canine HPO is not uncommon
but the exact percentage of dogs with such involvement
is unknown. Periosteal new bone (PNB) formation be-
gins distally in the limbs and spreads proximally.2
Therefore, pelvic involvement is more likely to occur in
more chronic cases. Because of the vertebral vein
metastases in this dog, some of the pelvic PNB could
have been secondary to carcinomatous deposits in the
pelvic venous plexuses. However, foci of carcinoma were
not demonstrated histologically and we believe that this
symmetrical pelvic PNB is related to HPO.

The degree of pelvic and femoral PNB was quite
remarkable. Usually PNB involves the diaphyses but in
this bitch the epiphyses and articular surfaces also were
severely affected, particularly in the tibiotarsal, femoro-
tibial, and radiohumeral joints. One cannot help but be
impressed by the contrast between the thickness of the
PNB deposits in the limbs and the small size of the
metastatic lesions in lungs.

Peptic Ulcer in the Dog

Peptic ulceration in the dog can produce clinical disease, sometimes with
serious consequences. A recent study has shown that peptic ulceration is
a disease largely of adult and aged dogs (ages ranging from 21/; to 12
years). While there was no breed predisposition, 14 of the 22 cases in this
study occurred in females. If this is a true reﬂection of the situation in the
dog, it is in contrast to that in man, where males are much more commonly
affected. The duration of the illness varied from sudden death, due to per-
foration usually with no previous clinical signs, to 3 months of gastrointes-
tinal disorder. The major features were vomiting, variable appetite, ab-
dominal pain, anemia, and occasionally loss of weight. Vomiting tended to
be related to feeding, sometimes occurring one-half to 3 hours later; occa-
sionally hematemesis occurred and in 1 dog melena was found. In most
cases appetite was variable; on some days it was normal, on other days
greatly reduced. Most dogs were markedly polydipsic, probably the result
of vomiting. Abdominal pain was clinically obvious in 2 dogs. Anemia was
severe in some cases and almost certainly was due to hemorrhage from the
lesions, which was found in 8 cases; in 5 of these, hemorrhage was into the
gastrointestinal tract and in 4, where perforation occurred, it was into the
peritoneal cavity.

Where healing did not occur, the major consequences were perforation
with peritonitis, and hemorrhage. Eight dogs, as a result of perforation,
showed evidence of an acute abdominal crisis; they collapsed suddenly, oc-
casionally vomited, developed severe abdominal pain and sometimes disten-
sion of the abdomen, and usually died within a few hours.

Some ulcers are apparently asymptomatic. One dog had a chronic peptic
ulcer in the duodenum but there were no visible ill effects.

Like man, the principal sites of peptic ulceration in the dog were in the
nonacid-peptic producing areas of the mucosa, the duodenum being most
commonly affected. In the duodenum, most ulcers were found close to the
pylorus although some occurred as far as 12 cm. away.

Peptic ulCeration is a condition which would appear to occur largely in
association with, or secondary to, other diseases; in only 6 of the 22 cases
in this study was peptic ulceration uncomplicated by any other major
disease.

Diagnosis by radiographic methods was unsatisfactory and conse-
quently, exploratory surgery is indicated as a diagnostic procedure. ,Primary
gastric tumors such as adenomatous polyps and carcinomas although difﬁcult
to differentiate from peptic ulceration on clinical grounds, may be differen-
tiated on the basis of radiographic examination and exploratory surger ——-

Surgical Correction of Tracheal Stenosis in a Dog

Wally Gordon, M.D.

COLLAPSE OF THE trachea, probably due to congenital
malformation of the tracheal rings, occurs in some dogs,
usually toy breedsx'm'“ A long section of the cranial por-
tion of the trachea and sometimes all of it is involved.
Pressure of the cuff of an endotracheal tube can cause
ulceration of the canine trachea.‘~’ Excessive inﬂation of
the cuff of an endotracheal tube retained for only-80
minutes probably caused short tracheal stenosis to occur
in a dog.6 A similar type of stenosis has developed at
the site of the inﬂated cuff of a tube that had been
maintained in the human trachea for several days.”

This report is concerned with surgical correction of
a stricture conﬁned to the mucosal layers of the thoracic
portion of the trachea in a dog.

Case History

As part of a study of the effects of low blood ﬂow
during hypothermia, an adult female dog, part German
Shepherd Dog, underwent right thoracotomy at a body
temperature of 28 C. The only intrathoracic manip-
ulation performed was occlusion of both venae cavae for
60 minutes while blood ﬂowed into the right atrium via
the azygos vein. A clean but not sterilized cuffed endo-
tracheal tube was retained for 7 hours during and after
the operation. The dog recovered from the operation
without any immediate complication. Six weeks later,
marked inspiratory and expiratory stridor and severe
intercostal retraction developed. Bronchoscopy revealed
stenosis that reduced the lumen of the trachea to a
diameter of 3 mm. The stenosis was 36 cm. from the
upper incisor teeth, well below the level of the cuff of
the endotracheal tube that had been used during the
previous operation. The bronchoscope was replaced by
an endotracheal tube connected to a mechanical venti-
lator which maintained ventilation of the lungs while
preparations were made for immediate surgical inter-
vention.

Through a median cervicothoracic incision the cra-
nial half of the sternum was split and the cervicothoracic
portion of the trachea was exposed. The external ap-
Dearance of the trachea was normal but a rigid segment
extending over 4 rings was felt in the thoracic portlon of
the trachea about 3 cm. cranial to the cranial limit of
the pericardium. This segment was excised and the di-
Vided ends were rejoined with interrupted sutures of
4-0 silk. While sutures were placed in the dorsal side

of the trachea, the lungs were ventilated through a tube
passed through the caudal portion of the trachea. This
tube was removed and the endotracheal tube was ad-
vanced across the dorsal suture line to maintain ventila—
tion while the anastomosis was completed (Fig. 1). The

muscles were closed with a continuous suture of 0 chro-
mic gut and the skin was closed with interrupted sutures
of 3-0 silk. Bronchoscopy at the end of the operation
revealed the trachea to be patent. Penicillin (600,000
units daily) was given intramuscularly for 10 days.

Histologic examination of the excised segment of
trachea indicated that the segment was composed of
collagenous tissue 1 cm. thick at the periphery, thinner
toward the central opening. Granulation tissue with
acute and chronic inﬂammatory cells and necrosis was
found on the free border, which was partly covered by
metaplastic squamous epithelium. The tracheal cartilage
was normal. A transverse section through the narrowest
part of the stenotic segment is shown (Fig. 2).

The dog recovered without complication. Immedi-
ately after the operation the lumen was slightly nar-
rower at the site of the anastomosis than it was in the
remainder of the trachea, but periodic bronchosc0py
over a 17-month period has not revealed any tendency
for it to become further reduced in diameter.

Comment

The younger the candidate for segmental excision of
the trachea, the longer the portion of trachea removed,
and the greater the tension on the suture line, the more
likely is the development of stricture at the site of the
anastomosis. Removal of only one tracheal ring in a
lamb will lead to minimal narrowing of the reconstituted
lumen. If 3 rings are excised, stenosis of 4 mm. diameter
forms in 6 weeks.1 Three of 22 adult dogs developed
stricture after transection and anastomosis of the cervi-
cal trachea.4 Minimal narrowing of the tracheal lumen
at the site of the anastomosis was revealed by radiog-
raphy 16 days after excision of a 2—cm. stenotic seg-
ment of a dog’s trachea.6 Of 34 human patients surviv-
ing segmental excision of the trachea, 2 developed
stenosis at the site of the anastomosis?” In the remain-
ing 32 patients and the dog of this report, the tracheal
lumen has remained adequate and constant in size.

Brucella canis Infection

Brucella canis was ﬁrst reported in 1966 as a cause of canine abortions.
Canine infections with B. canis have been subsequently recognized as being
widespread in the United States, particularly in ﬁeld-type dogs. In the
period 1966—1970, 9 human infections with B. canis were reported; none
were reported in 1971. In a recent survey of 1,208 military recruits, ages 18
to 26, 5 (0.4%) were found to have B. canis titers of 1:100 or greater, with
the highest observed titer being 1:400. None of the serums contained anti-
body to B. suis.

Of the 9 human B. canis infections reported, 7 were associated with clin—
ical disease. The 8th person, Who was given tetracycline after exposure due
to laboratory accident, had a serologic response only, and the last case was
a subclinical infection detected by a routine serologic screening program of
personnel in a laboratory dog colony.

The illness in 5 of the 7 symptomatic patients was characterized by
headache (4), fatigue (3), lymphadenopathy (3), fever (2), chills (2 ), night
sweats (2), malaise (1), pain in legs and arms (1), chest pains (1), pharyn-
gitis (1), thrombophlebitis (1), enlarged spleen (1), and abdominal ab-
scess (1).

Six of the 9 infections resulted from laboratory accidents, 2 from expo-
sure to infected dogs, and 1 from an undetermined source.

Brucella canis infections in dogs are clinically characterized by general-
ized lymphadenitis and splenitis, early undetectable embryonic deaths or
abortions, and prolonged vaginal discharge following abortion. Infected
males frequently have epididymitis, dermatitis of the scrotum, and testicular
atrophy which is often unilateral. Persistent bacteremia is common. Most
infected dogs, however, do not have clinical signs.

The epizootiology of the canine disease has not been clearly deﬁned.
Spread of infection may result from venereal transmission, ingestion of
aborted material or vaginal discharge, exposure to contaminated urine or
direct transmission via fomites. ,

Because B. canis antibody does not react with the standard brucella
antigen used in febrile agglutinin testing, a speciﬁc B. canis antigen must be
used—CDC Brucellosis Surveillance, Annual Summary—1971 (Oct, 1972) :

Minimal Cost, Nonprofit Veterinary Service

Bruce Max Feldmann, D.V.M., and Tony H. Carding, B.V.Sc., M.R.C.V.S.

MINIMAL COST, nonproﬁt veterinary
service is a highly controversial and
even emotional issue within the vet-
erinary profession. The quotations
herein from the recent literature
sharply illustrate the vast differ-
ences of opinion and concept that
exist in our profession vis-d-vis this
issue.

The Problem

. . our primary consideration is
the animal rather than its owner——
much less his pocketbook—. . . we
[are obligated] to seek ways to
broaden the basis for pet practice.
It serves no useful purpose to have
anyone obtain a supposedly healthy
dog at the pound only to have it die
of distemper—or later produce
more unwanted pups. Either we
can devise mutually acceptable
means for helping some of the less
affluent public in this regard—and
cultivate a few prospective clients
in the proceSS—or we can maintain
the status quo. At least for the time
being we still have a choice.16

I take serious issue—is that cost is

and thus a reduction in the fee will
sufficiently increase the number of
sterile animals to have an ‘impact’
on the pet population. To my way
of thinking it is not valid at all to
conclude that if a service costs X
number of dollars, more people will
avail themselves of the same service
if you reduce the fee. . . .11

Pet animal practitioners will soon
have to decide whether their func-
tion is strictly a luxury service, lim-
ited to those able and willing to pay
their fees, or if it also includes a
responsibility to the public interest
for providing a greater amount of
service for those without the means
to pay the prevailing rates. . . .2

Already the government has
learned from studies made of homes
for the aged that pets provide an
important psychological uplift for
the residents, and there is an in—
creasing—if reluctant—acceptance
on the part of our bureaucrats of
the fact that pets play an important
part in the attitudes and well-being
of many of our populace who are
unable to assume the ﬁnancial re-
sponsibility for their care. Perhaps
the free or low-cost clinics now op-
erated in some areas by veterinary
groups to provide rabies [vaccina-
tions], using the donated time of
their members, might be expanded
to include the treatment of other
basic animal health needs. It might
well be a reasonable price to pay
for getting this rapidly growmg
monkey off the back of the profes-
sion, and certainly a problem that
should command the full attention
of every man with a stake in pet
practice.2

Practice income should grow
[during the ’70’s] at a rate exceed-
ing the average of other busmesses
and professions, and should outrun
inﬂation by a healthy margin. Es-

timates are that inﬂation will con-
tinue at 4 to 5% per year, while
practice income should grow 8 to
10%.2

In this day of socialism and
bleeding hearts for the so-called
disadvantaged it is high time that
a voice be raised in the cause of
reason and the cause of what is just
plain old-fashioned right . . . a pet
is a luxury, . . . a privilege to be
earned. . . .“

. . . Will we have state-operated
clinics to treat pets of owners who
cannot afford veterinary care today?
Those that claim that ‘pets are a
luxury’ are living in the past. Wel-
fare regulations consider TV’s and
cars as necessities along with med-
ical care. Pet medical care should
be next on the list.10

Personal poverty is difﬁcult to
measure. How does one measure
the personal poverty of a child in
any family who may have in his
possession a pet of high emotional
value? How does one measure the
psychologic uplift in attitude and
well-being of those in the “cement
society” whose only contact with
nature is a pet? A pet can help a
person move away from self-over-
concern, self-pity, and even suicide.
Young married couples, delaying
conception of a child, often acquire
a pet seemingly as a substitute
baby. If the pet is a pup, it often
becomes a friend and protector of
the human baby, transferring al-
legiance from the parents as the
child grows. Some pets are a re-
placement for the baby that is never
born (or adopted); many owners
of such pets quite openly assume
the role of “parents.”

It has been argued that minimal

cost, nonproﬁt veterinary service
would encourage irresponsible pet
ownership. However, the nation-
wide (and worldwide) pet popula-
tion explosion has been proceeding
apace for a number of years now
seemingly unhindered by the wide-
spread unavailability of low-cost
veterinary services of an organized
kind.1~596~11 People have always ac-
quired (and presumably always will
acquire) pets for reasons that run
the gamut of human thought and
emotion and which may be reason-
able or unreasonable, responsible or
irresponsible, healthy or neurotic.
It seems highly unlikely that the
presence or absence of minimal cost,
nonproﬁt veterinary service will
have signiﬁcant impact on the mul-
titude of rational and irrational
reasons that inﬂuence whether or
not one acquires a pet. For exam-
ple, household income has a dom-
inant inﬂuence on pet ownership—
the higher the income, the greater
the ownership level.9

Some physicians would argue
that free or low-cost health services
for children of the poor are inap-
propriate, because (1) children are
a luxury and (2) those persons un-
able to pay the going rate for their
dependents’ medical services ought
not to have children. Similar argu-
ments are often heard from veter-
inarians with regard to veterinary
service for indigent pet owners and
minimal cost, nonproﬁt veterinary
care. Though “pets” are certainly
not to be indiscriminately equated
with “children,” it would seem that
the aforementioned arguments are
irrelevant and inhumane. For the
inescapable fact is that people have
acquired pets, and will continue to
acquire them, regardless of how pet
ownership is philosophically classi-
ﬁed by veterinarians, veterinary
and humane associations, or govern-
ments. Extensive mass public ed-
ucation appears to be the only
practical hope for changing atti-
tudes and behavior with regard to
pet ownership.

The question is not whether pri-
vate veterinary fees are fair or
equitable but rather that a signif-
icant portion of the pet-owning
public is simply unable to pay for
the kind of veterinary care now
available; thus, the pets of these

482

owners must suffer from .lack of
veterinary care. We must deal with
this problem realistically and not
create a hypothetical ideal that will
never be realized: monied-only pet
ownership. Many private veterinar-
ians donate time and resources to
the occasional indigent client whom
the veterinarian judges to be worthy
of such consideration. These well-
meaning and noble efforts are in the
highest tradition of humane veter-
inary medicine and deserve every
respect and recognition. However,
such activity is likely to be statis-
tically insigniﬁcant compared to the
pet animal suffering that must exist
due to low-income and indigent pet
owners who are unable to provide
their pets with veterinary medical
care. Does organized veterinary
medicine have any obligation and
responsibility to these pets and
their owners? Ought we, as some
would suggest, take the position
that we have no responsibility in
this area, as pets are strictly a lux-
ury indulgence, and it’s simply an
unfortunate, but inevitable, in—
equity that a pet must suffer be-
cause of his owner’s economic sit—
uation or irresponsibility?14 What
is the proper perspective for or—
ganized veterinary medicine? Most
important, what collective activities
might we undertake that would be
consistent with our Oath and with
a humane and professional veter—
inary medicine?

Action—Not Words

What effect this program [a city—
run, low-cost neutering clinic] will
have on the animal problem re-
mains to be seen. But in conjunc—
tion with an established, intelli-
gently run control program it can
hardly fail to» have some impact by
reaching owners who otherwise
would not have their animals neu-
tered. And in this regard it. is per-
haps unfortunate that veterinarians
in the area elected to not become
involved, if only for the image-
building beneﬁts, in the original
plan to provide a subsidy for own—
ers unable to pay the going rates.
But as now constituted the 'pro-
gram is open to anyone, and it will
inevitably be used by some persons
able to pay regular fees.6

The owning of a pet can be in
certain instances of great value
emotionally and mentally. I am

sure [that] we would be willing for
our government to spend our tax
money for these selected cases. I
maintain [that] we are no more re-
sponsible for these conditions or
their alleviation than any doctor,
lawyer, merchant, chief or TV re-
pairman, plumber, or dispenser of
beef.”

Let us stop this self—ﬂagellation
and realize that we owe no more to
these people [indigent pet owners]
than does any other citizen.“

We do owe it to the pets to speak
out loud and clear against the own-
ing of pets by those who are un-
able to care for them.“

. . . A person, underprivileged or
not, who lacks the facility or is un-
willing to see to it that his animal
is not indiscriminately bred, is sim-
ply not a suitable owner. . . .n

. . . people who have a dog should
be willing to assume responsibility
for it, and if they are unwilling or,
in fact, are unable to do so, this is
prima facie evidence that the an-
imal itself——regardless of the hu-
mane implicationmwill suffer, and
in fact is suffering. . . .“

. Veterinarians should con-
tribute their thoughts and cooperate
with public agencies and others
who concern themselves with our
ecology, particularly as it involves
companion animals}7

The city [might] construct an
alteration surgery hospital, which
would be staffed through the ofﬁces
of the Veterinary Association.17

. . . The SCVMA recognizes the
existence of a serious problem,
caused by a surplus of unwanted
dogs and cats. This Association be«
lieves that the veterinary profes-
sion has a responsibility to coop-
erate with government and private
interests in solving this problem. . . .
it is veterinary medicine’s respon-
sibility to administer to the SiCk
and injured animal, and [to] pro-
long a healthy life for all animals.
It is society’s responsibility to pro-
mote and implement a [pet] POP‘
ulation control program. . . f

. a situation bordering on a
disaster is confronting our COm‘
munity. . . .4

Stray dogs and cats . . . [are]
a self—perpetuating nuisance to
everyone, and collecting and. 9‘
stroying strays requires cons1der—
able energy and moneY/your
money—that might better be ex-
pended on people. This is a waste

groups have arranged for spaying
of adopted animaIS~but too often
we have insisted on substantial if
not regular fees. By submerging
self-interest. a little as more govern—
mental units require spaying for
these animals, we can gain a valu-
able opportunity to demonstrate
our commitment to the public good.
Through local associations we could
each invest a half-day a month to
provide such a service at no more
than out—of—pocket cost. The result?
More people with more pets~~—but
pets unable to compound the prob—
lem and some of these. pet owners
will inevitably become clients. A
further benefit to us will be a re—
duced demand for emergency vet-
erinary service to animals who
prove to be unowned. What have
we to lose?“

Veterinary medicine is an essen-
tial facet of healthy living and a
healthy environment. Appropriate
professional activities that would
augment the guardianship of an-
imal health and educate those pet
owners who cannot afford standard
fees would be a step in the direction
of a healthier society. The veter-
inary medical profession cannot be
singled out to bear the burden of
an animal welfare program. How-
ever, inasmuch as the state (the
taxpayer) contributes more than 3
of every 4 dollars of a college stu-
dent’s educational costs and inas-
much as veterinary students beneﬁt
from this educational subsidy twice
as long as most college students,
each veterinarian’s obligation and
responsibility to society and the
community may be said to be even
greater than that of most college—
educated citizens. In any case,
government’s increasing social-
mindedness may threaten the pro-
fession’s stability if it stands too
rigidly against the demands for (1)
veterinary medical service to the
Indigent and (2) solutions to urban
pet problems. If the profession
gives less than its best, some of the
exclusive rights now enjoyed may

nlent of public veterinary clinics

to develop new categories of veter-
inary medical manpower, e.g., com-
munity volunteers who are con-
cerned with urban pet' problems
and humane animal care and who
are trained to educate the public.
Veterinary medical and humane or-
ganizations have generally been un-
able to agree on mutually beneﬁcial
courses of action that would ame-
liorate the situation. So far, or-
ganized veterinary medicine has
limited most of its activity in these
areas to taking stands and issuing
policy statements. If positive and
meaningful measures are not imple-
mented, the job will eventually be
done by government; and the veter-
inary profession will lose its voice
and choice by forfeit.

The Future

If organized charity veterinary
service proves workable and worth-
while, it would seem important to
publicize such service only as much
as needed to maintain awareness
of its availability in the commu—
nity. Out of consideration for har-
monious intraprofessional relations,
practitioners electing to participate
perhaps should velunteer their ser-
vices to a sponsoring community or-
ganization without involving their
local veterinary organization. .
Social responsibility, if it is to be
truly meaningful, should remain
vested with the individual.12

. until a more economical and
efﬁcient method of sterilization is
developed, animal population con-
trol clinics can best be implemented,
developed, and staffed by local vet—
erinary medical associations where
such clinics are needed.1

The veterinary profession is
aware that some important social
problems are associated with man’s
cohabitation with pets, but recog-
nizes that pets are often essential
to man’s well-being . . . the public
interest is best served when local
governments assume the responsi-
bility for dealing with these prob-
lems and utilize veterinary man—
power and facilities in achieving
solutions.3

The [House Advisory] Commit-
tee recommended that the Council
on Veterinary Service be requested
to develop guidelines for the role
of the veterinarian in pet overpop—
ulation control [carried by the
House of Delegates].3

The Council [on Biological and
Therapeutic Agents] reviewed the

problem of [the] pet population ex-
plosion, which it views with con-
cern. Recognizing that it will be
some time before an effective al-
ternative to euthanasia-spaying is
practicable, the Council approved
the following recommendations:

1) That the excellent literature
on the subject be given further
distribution.

2) That veterinarians be en-
couraged to help develop and co—
operate in the different local pro-
grams for sterilization, including
programs for control of stray an—
imals, as an interim, partial
method of control. . . .“

. The sterilization injection
and the rabies injection could be
given at the same time. The over—
population of animals must be
solved by all of the entities closely

~ involved with pet animals and their

welfare: the dog food companies;
the SPCA; the profession of veter—
inary medicine; federal and local
government; dog and cat owners.
Everyone must work together on
the problem.8

. . . Pet owners themselves must
accept a stronger built—in responsi-
bility for their animals. The enjoy-
ment of a pet carries a commen-
surate responsibility. And as [pet
owners] have been educated to ac-
cept the necessity of the rabies vac-
cination, they must learn to accept
the fact that they are totally liable
as citizens for the number of un-
wanted animals [that] their pets
might produce.”

Many of you have been quietly
going along solving as much of the
[pet] overpopulation problem as
you can in your own bailiwicks.
You deserve all our praise. I’m re-
ferring to the men among you who
have been spaying animals at a
bare breakeven cost—charging a fee
which just clears expenses. This
fee, in some cases, is a bare $20 as
compared to a $60 or $70 fee
charged by a veterinarian in the
next neighborhood.8

Perhaps the county neutering
clinic is another part of the answer.
A clinic where veterinarians and
others under their direction could
give volunteer hours each week to
neuter animals at the lowest pos-
sible cost. This would follow in the
solid tradition [that] your profes-
sion has already established—ser-
vice to the community and to the
animals you care for. . . .3

. . . Let us [veterinarians] arrive
at solutions to animal health and
welfare problems objectively, not
hysterically, and then let us im—

plement [emphasis added] the
prOper programs.13

Time is growing short. Are we
currently fulﬁlling our collective
professional responsibilities to in-
digent owners and their pets? To
the extent that organized veter-
inary medicine avoids confront-
ing urban pet-related problems,
younger, socially minded veter-
inarians are discouraged from being
a part of and working within or-
ganized veterinary medicine. Can
we afford it? At the very least, our
profession needs to mount orga-
nized and massive public education
campaigns that stress (1) the ster-
ilization of dogs and cats before
they become of breeding age and
(2) the obligations and criteria of
responsible pet ownership.

In the ﬁeld of human medicine,
numerous citizens’ groups from
coast to coast are assaulting the
traditional autonomy and authority
of the medical profession and its
institutions; these citizens’ groups
are Winning a bigger say—some-
times a dominant one—in the ﬁ-
nancing and delivery of health care.
More and more, responsible voices
are being raised in support of such
concepts as “community control”
of health services and “medical
power to the people.” Says a Yale

University public health profes-
sor: “. . . [the question of] con-
sumer participation [in health care]
was a hot issue. Now the question
is what part should the community
play, not whether it should.” Few
politicians have failed to notice, for
Americans of almost every social
and political persuasion are dis-
satisﬁed with the health care that
they receive. It has been suggested
that they may be “fed up enough
to demand more direct controlover
the technology and the technocrats
whom they depend on for good
health.”2 It seems reasonable to as—
sume that veterinary medicine too
will ultimately have to deal with
these challenging concepts in socio-
medical thinking. If we do not con-
structively anticipate these chal—
lenges and signiﬁcantly contribute
to the solution of contemporary pet
problems, we will only be contrib—
uting to the general malaise and to

future crises within the profession. .

of Veterinary Laboratory
Diagnosticians

Serologic Interpretation of Leptospirosis

Traditionally, it has been emphasized that the diag-
nosis of an infectious disease should be based on a
signiﬁcant rise in antibody titer (at least fourfold) be-
tween serum specimens taken during the acute phase of
the disease and convalescence. Unfortunately, few vet-
erinarians have the opportunity to apply this principle
when diagnosing leptospirosis. In most instances the
disease has existed in a herd of cattle or swine for some
time before the problem is brought to the attention of
the attending veterinarian or health ofﬁcial.

In herds of beef cattle and swine, abortion, stillbirths,
or weak baby pigs are the most frequent initial signs
observed. Since these signs appear 2 to 4 weeks after
Infection, the dam is usually seropositive in high titer
when the ﬁrst signs are seen. Consequently, the demon-
stration of a fourfold rise in antibody titer is impossible.
When signs such as fever, inappetence, agalactia, bloody
milk, or hemoglobinuria associated with the acute febrile
phase prompt the owner to consult a veterinarian, he
then has the fortuitous opportunity to conﬁrm a diag-
nosis by a signiﬁcant rise in antibody titer. The initial
case of leptospirosis in a herd is rarely recognized, and
9V§n when the acute febrile phase is detected in an
finlmal, others in the herd are already seropositive from
Infection experienced before the recognized case.

Despite the difﬁculty of conﬁrming a diagnosis by
eInonstrating a fourfold rise in antibody titer, serologlc
ﬁndings are helpful if applied on a herd basis. Samplmg
Seﬁlms from 1 or 2 animals that may have aborted

samples from at least 10 animals or 10% of the herd,
whichever is greater. The same rule applies when age
groups or other epizootiologic categories are studied. By
correlating the serologic status of animals and the dis-
tribution of titers with the past clinical and epizo-
otiologic history of animals studied, the diagnostician can
often make a reasonably accurate diagnosis of lepto-
spirosis without having to base it on a fourfold rise in
antibody titer. Unquestionably, some results are difﬁcult
to interpret and do not clearly indicate the presence or
absence of leptospirosis, particularly when a herd has
experienced an extended epizootic or is infected with
more than one serotype. . .

Because the plate test does not regularly detect anti-
bodies in retrospect as long after infection as the micro-
scopic agglutination test does, the former offers an ad-
vantage in establishing a more temporal relationship
between antibodies and disease. Most livestock (cattle,
horses, and swine) will develop peak antibody titers of
1: 160 or greater and sustain that level for several months
after infection with the pomona serotype. After the peak
titer is reached, it gradually declines; some animals re-
tain titers at the 1:160 to 1:640 levels; most drop to the
1:10 to 1:40 range; some animals even become seronega-
tive. Because some animals remain seropositive for years
after infection, the mere presence of antibodies may not
bear a temporal relationship to the disease in question,
and certainly does not indicate the degree of contagious-
ness ordinarily associated with positive serologic ﬁndings
in brucellosis.—H. G. Stoenner, Hamilton, Mont.

Lead Poisoning

In many instances, lead poisoning has been a difficult
condition to diagnose in different species of animals.
There are several reasons why this difﬁculty may exist.
It is now well recognized that the clinical signs of lead
poisoning vary from species to species. Furthermore, the

485

 

 




 

 

 

 

clinical signs observed from animal to animal of some
species, and even from time to time in the same animal,
may vary. In acute poisoning, for example, severe de-
pression and constipation may be observed in some
cattle, whereas in others, a highly nervous state and
diarrhea may be observed. Occasionally, the same two
sets of clinical signs are observed in the same animal
during the course of lead poisoning. In some animals,
paralysis is observed; in others paralytic signs are miss-
ing. There is also considerable variation in the degree
and extent of lesions observed in cases of lead poisoning
so that it mimics other disease conditions. Consequently,
there is a tendency to depend very heavily upon the
blood-lead level in clinical cases and the lead concentra-
tion of the liver and kidneys in terminal cases for a
diagnosis rather than for supportive ﬁndings.

In lead poisoning as in other conditions, diagnosis
depends on the clinical observations, the gross and
microscopic lesions, and the ﬁnding of abnormally high
concentrations of lead in the liver and kidney tissues.
The lead value in unexposed animals is considered to
be under 2 p.p.m. in the liver and kidney tissues on a
wet basis. Values over 2 p.p.m. should be considered in
conjunction with other ﬁndings. Levels of lead in the
liver and kidneys of animals that have died from lead
poisoning are usually in excess of ’7 p.p.m. on a wet basis,
and many will have levels of over 60 p.p.m. Liver and
kidney tissues containing over 10 and 20 p.p.m., respec—
tively, on a wet basis are sufﬁcient to conﬁrm a diagnosis
of lead poisoning—R. H. Singer, College Station, Texas.

Chlamydiosis

Chlamydiosis (psittacosis) caused by Chlamydia
psittaci is a rare disease in the chicken but not quite
so rare in the turkey. It is quite common in parrots
and parakeets. Many avian clinicians are apt to en—
counter this disease in the diagnostic laboratory when
members of the parrot family are involved. Although
the disease in psittacine birds is usually characterized
by respiratory infection, there are lesions in the central
nervous system (CNS). Diagnosis depends primarily on
determining the presence of a plastic pericarditis, peri-
hepatitis, and swollen liver with necrotic foci. In parrots,
pigeons, man, and turkeys, splenomegaly is character-
istic.

The disease is transmitted chieﬂy by inhalation.
Contact with an infected carcass is adequate exposure
for disease transfer. Droplet infection from man to
man is rare.

A history of a respiratory condition in a psittacine
bird or a pigeon should cause one to suspect chlamyd-
iosis. Impression smears of the air sacs taken at time
of necropsy and stained with Macchiavello’s stain may
provide evidence of LCL bodies in the cytoplasm, pre-
sumptive evidence of Chlamydia, infection. Mouse
inoculation intracranially, if pigeons are involved, or
intraperitoneally if other birds or animals are involved,
may be done to isolate the agent. In chicks the CNS
lesion is indistinguishable from mycoplasmosis, and is
mainly in the form of vasculitis. Respiratory signs will

486

not usually be seen in the chicken nor is this disease a
ﬂock problem in chickens—E. S. Bryant, Storrs, Conn.

Analysis of lmmunodiffusion Test for
Equine Infectious Anemia

The agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGI) test was adapted
for the diagnosis of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in
Canada. The preparation of the AGI test antigen by
acetone-ether extraction gave more antigen doses from
good reactive spleen pulps and rendered usable spleen
pulps that were not reactive as such. The extracted
antigen could be titrated by complement ﬁxation to
give an indication of its reactivity in the ACI test.

The sensitivity of the direct and indirect comple-
ment-ﬁxation tests-(DCF and ICF) was evaluated and
compared to the A01 test. The AGI test was more reliable
for the diagnosis of EIA than either CF method. The
DCF antibodies appeared at the same time as the AGI
antibodies and disappeared subsequently, as they were
replaced by the noncomplement-ﬁxing ones detected by
the ICF test. Both CF types of antibodies could occa-
sionally be found in the same serum.

The epizootiologic observations made after almost
two years of testing under the control program im-
plemented in Canada allow us to conclude that the
infection was controlled efﬁciently on racetrack opera-
tions following removal of reactor horses. The infection
persisted in other types of operations where the per-
centage of reactors was originally higher and where
clinical cases of the disease occurred with poor hygienic
conditions—S. P. Carrier et al., Hull, Que, Canada.

Toxoplasmosis

The demonstration of antibodies to Toxoplasma im-
plies a history of infection. Only newborns can possess
antibodies without previous infection by virtue of passive
transfer from the mother. Antibodies are usually de-
tectable in serum 5 to 8 days after infection and may
persist for years in low titer. In man, the appearance
of antibodies, their level, and their subsequent loss
offer a characteristic pattern which can serve as an
index in the diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. However, the
absence of antibodies or a failure to detect them doeS
not necessarily mean absence of infection. This iS
especially true in ophthalmic toxoplasmosis.

The dye test in animals has been employed With
varying success. One investigator in 1970 claimed that
the dye test had limited value after he examined large
numbers of Dutch pigs, cows, and sheep. He showed
that 100% of sows had a positive dye test titer, and that
74% of slaughter pigs, 32.7% of cattle, and 95% 0f
sheep were also test positive. He indicated that for
individual cases in these circumstances investigation at
a 2- to 3-week interval would be necessary to establish
the status of infection. In our laboratory we found the
test satisfactory for domestic pets but too expensive to
encourage widespread sampling.

The complement-ﬁxation test has not been employed
to any signiﬁcant extent in animals although in man

J.A.V.M.A., Vol. I62. No. b

 




 

it has been found to yield results similar to those ob-
tained with the dye test.

In man the indirect hemagglutination test is almost
as good as the dye test.

The latex agglutination test is considerably less
speciﬁc than the dye test, especially on low-titer anti-
serums.

The direct agglutination test titers are usually less
than those found in the dye test.

Recently, there has been wider use of the indirect
hemagglutination test for which a commercial kit is
now available and the indirect ﬂuorescent-antibody test.

In addition to antibody production, toxoplasma in-
fection leads to acquired cellular immunity and delayed
hypersensitivity. The delayed skin reaction generally
becomes positive within one month and persists for a
long time. It is probable that this cellular immunity
may be a better reﬂection of immunity than the serologic
tests commonly employed—I. R. Tizard et al., Guelph,
Ont., Canada.

Evaluation of the Anaplasmosis MCT

An evaluation of the modiﬁed card test (MCT) on
serum and plasma samples from cattle naturally and
experimentally infected with Anaplasma marginale was
conducted. About 97% of the MCT results agreed with
those of the complement-ﬁxation (CF) test on samples
from naturally infected cattle, and 100% agreed with
results obtained on samples from experimentally in-
fected cattle. Since the MCT is a rapid diagnostic pro-
cedure that can be done at the ranch, infected cattle can
be immediately treated and separated without waiting
several days for CF test results—T. E. Amerault et al.,
Beltsville, Md.

Porcine Stress Syndrome

Porcine stress syndrome (malignant hyperthermia)
is a problem in all or nearly all areas where modern
swine production methods are employed and where there
has been a genetic selection for heavy muscling. Often
there is a history of previous occurrence in certaln
closely related bloodlines, on one or several premises.
Within an individual operation, losses are often conﬁned
to certain litters, also supporting the belief that a
genetic predisposition exists.

Characteristically there are sudden unexpected
deaths in otherwise healthy pigs of a certain size (180
lb. (54.3 kg.) or more), age (over 4 months old), and
conformation (compact, heavily muscled animals with
10W backfat), after such incidents as ﬁghting, handling,
or halothane anesthesia.

Veterinarians, animal scientists, and producers can
detect certain signs in stress-susceptible animals after
physical exertion or other types of stress. Shortly after
exertion starts, the pigs develop muscular tremors (par-
ticularly tail tremors), dyspnea, stiffness of the muscles,
and reluctance to move. In White-skinned animals
peculiar patches of erythema alternate with blanched
areas. Rectal temperature tends to be hlgher (106 to
112 F.; 41.1 to 44.4 C.) than one would expect in

March l5. I973

normal pigs subjected to comparable stress. If the stress
continues, the pig becomes recumbent and dies in a
condition which outwardly, at least, resembles shock.

There is an absence of striking gross lesions at
necropsy. Rigor mortis develops extremely rapidly after
death, even as early as 5 minutes, so that stiffness of
the limbs is noticeable sooner and in a more exaggerated
state than one would expect in normal animals or in
those which died from other causes. The viscera may
be congested and frothy material is sometimes found
in the trachea and bronchioles.

About 60% of stress-susceptible pigs will develop
pale, soft, so-called “exudative” pork within an hour
or two in the cooler after stress and exsanguination
at slaughter. The name “exudative” is not accurate
from a histologic standpoint because evidence of an
antemortem exudative process is not observed.

Certain muscles. are more often affected than others,
notably the longissimus dorsi (loin) and the gluteus
medius, and biceps femoris of the ham muscles. Failure
of other ham muscles (gluteus profundus and iliopsoas)
to develop the condition sometimes confers a “two-
toned” appearance to the muscle.

Other than genetic selection, control measures are
of the stopgap type: minimize rough handling and avoid
mixing strange animals. A decrease in the glycogen
level in muscles decreases the exudative condition, so
preslaughter fasting would reduce this development, as
does rapid postslaughter cooling in the packing plant.
Favorable results with a tranquilizer prior to slaughter
have been reported, but current considerations dis-
courage use of agents which might form undesirable
residue in edible animal products—R. A. Ball et al.,
Ames, Iowa.

Bacillus cereus. an Abortitacient in Livestock

Bacillus cereus, an ubiquitous, aerobic, spore-forming
bacterium, is able to cause abortion in cattle and sheep
when overwhelming bacteremia of the dam exists.
Necrotic placentitis was a consistent ﬁnding indicating
that the placenta is the prime site of infection following
bacteremia. All fetuses appeared to have died 24 to 48
hours prior to their expulsion. Hypoxia due to the
placentitis or an acute fetal bacteremia or toxemia
caused by B. cereus can be postulated as the cause of
fetal death.

The signiﬁcance of bacteria isolated from abortion
specimens may be difﬁcult to establish due to the broad
variety of microorganisms, ranging from recognized
abortifacients to ubiquitous contaminants.

The signiﬁcance of opportunistic pathogens and their
ability to cause abortion must not be overlooked. The
vulnerability of the conceptus to infection is well known.

Bacteria of low Virulence or those that cause disease
other than abortion can be considered abortifacients
when the following criteria are fulﬁlled: (1) the organism
is isolated in pure culture from the fetal abomasal con-
tent, tissues, and placenta; (2) lesions of inﬂammation
are observed upon microscopic examination of the fetal
tissues, placenta, or both; (3) no other infectious agents
(viruses, fungi, yeasts, mycoplasmas, protozoans, or
bacteria) are isolated or demonstrated; and (4) bacteria

487

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

morphologically similar to the isolant are seen in close
association with the lesions of inﬂammation in the
tissue—K. Wohlgemuth et al., Brookings, S. Dak.

Laboratory Diagnosis of TGE of Swine

Over a 2-year period, 47 of 132 cases (36%) and
67 of 231 swine (29%) were positive for transmissible
gastroenteritis (TGE) by immunoﬂuorescence procedures.
Of 85 swine from positive cases, 67 (79%) were positive
by ﬂuorescent-antibody techniques. The fastest, easiest
to perform, most effective procedure was the examination
of frozen sections of the jejunum from acutely ill animals
by the ﬂuorescent—antibody tissue section (FATS) tech-
nique. Only 2 cases were found to be positive by the
ﬂuorescent-antibody tissue culture (FATC) technique
which were negative by FATS. A considerable number
of cases, 15 of 47 (32%), of TGE were detected by
immunoﬂuorescence in swine over 2 weeks of age. The
majority of positive cases of TGE, 38 of 47 (81%),
occurred in Missouri during the months of January
through April. The recurrence of the disease in a num-
ber of counties over a 2—year period suggests the pos-
sibility of enzootic foci.——R. F. Solorzano, Columbia, Mo.

Haemophilus somnus Laryngitis in Feedlot Calves

Haemophilus somnus was not isolated from laryngeal
lesions observed in calves infected naturally or experi-
mentally. However, H. somnus was isolated from either
the submandibular or cervical lymph nodes of 10 of 27
calves with laryngeal necrosis. Spherophorus necroph—
orus was isolated from 14 of the necrotic laryngeal
lesions.

Spherophorus necrophorus has classically been con-
sidered the etiologic agent of calf diphtheria, but the
condition has never been experimentally reproduced with
S. necrophorus alone or in combination with other
pathogens. It would seem that S. necrophorus has been
incriminated solely by circumstantial evidence.

A great deal more evidence, circumstantial and ex—
perimental, indicates a close association between H.
somnus infections and laryngeal necrosis in calves. The
high incidence of laryngeal necrosis in calves, naturally
or experimentally infected with H. somnus, indicates a
more than casual relationship between the septicemias
resulting from invasion by H. somnus and calf
diphtheria.

The necrotizing vasculitis resulting from H. somnus
septicemia is responsible for the cerebral lesions classiﬁed
in earlier years as “thromboembolic meningoencephalo-
myelitis.” But the vasculitis and thrombosis occur in
many tissues; and indeed, the bilateral symmetry of the
smaller focal areas of laryngeal necrosis, observed in
ﬁeld cases and experimental animals, suggests blood-
vascular damage as the initiating factor in calf
diphtheria.

Based on these ﬁeld observations and initial experi-
mental studies, it appears that calf diphtheria can be
reproduced experimentally and with signiﬁcant consis-
tency and that complete understanding of the patho-
genesis is near.——R. C. Dillman, Ames, Iowa.

Rectal Stricture in Swine

Fourteen swine with rectal stricture from 8 farms
were studied. All 14 swine ranged in weight from 75
to 175 lb. (34 to 52 kg.) and were over 10 weeks old.
The owners referred to the condition as “big belly.”
All swine delivered dead had a history of diarrhea, large
abdomen, and emaciation, and all obtained live had
these clinical characteristics when received. The con-
dition could be diagnosed clinically by the impasse in
passing the index ﬁnger in the rectum beyond 5 cm.

On one farm, it appeared that this condition affected
over 20% of a herd. On another farm, over 10% of a
herd of 220 swine had been affected. On ”2 other large
farms, only occasionally did a pig develop this condition.
On the other 4 farms, it appeared that less than 5% of
the growing swine were affected. On several occasions,
histories were received from farmers that slightly
emaciated swine with diarrhea and distended abdomen
recovered sufficiently to be fattened and marketed.

With all swine, there was a constriction of the lumen
of the rectum beginning approximately 2 cm. proximal
to the anal sphincter. The length of the constriction
varied from 2 to 9 cm. and the lumen of the rectum
in this area was greatly narrowed but always patent.
Microscopically, the surface of the rectum in the con-
striction was devoid of mucosa and the smooth muscle
in the rectal wall was replaced with ﬁbrous connective
tissue. There was an increased vascularity in the rectal
wall where the stricture began. This area, also, was
devoid of lymphoid tissue which is common in normal
swine. The lumen of the rectum proximal to the stric-
ture was greatly distended and the rectal wall was
thickened. In some swine the mucosa in the distended
area was intact, whereas in others it was lost and the
surface was roughened. With 2 of these swine, the
rectum contained over a gallon of ﬂuid feces. In no
instance was there a constriction of the anus. With 3
of the affected swine, the colon connected with the

rectum in more than one place—L. D. Olson, Columbia,
Mo.

Mercury Intoxication

Exposure of animals to mercury compounds suﬂicient
to cause poisoning has been rare until recent years. The
use of mercury was limited mainly to medicinal prep-
arations and an occasional case of poisoning would re-
sult from misuse. For example, the prolonged use of
mercurial ointments to combat louse infestation in cattle
has resulted in chronic poisoning.

The main source of exposure in recent years has been
mercurial fungicides for treating seed grain. In some
cases, discarded bags that had contained mercuIY'
treated seed grain were used for feed bags, even though
warnings against this practice were printed on the bags.
The contamination of the feed by the residues remaining
in the bags was sufficient to cause poisoning of animals
eating the contaminated feed.

Poultry fed mercury-treated seed grain can accumu-
late sufﬁcient mercury in their tissues in the form 0f
methyl mercury to be poisonous if used as feed for

J.A.V.M.A.l Vol. I62. No. 6

 




 

laboratory animals, although outward clinical signs of
poisoning are not observed in the poultry.

The clinical signs of acute mercury poisoning in all
species are much the same. After mercury salts are
ingested, severe shock, collapse, and death may occur
in an hour or more. If shock does not occur, severe
gastroenteritis and diarrhea are observed, along with

severe depression. Vomiting is observed in simple-
stomached animals. If the animal survives more than
24 hours, severe colic, accompanied by severe diarrhea
and depression, is observed. Body temperature is usually
subnormal. Albuminuria is also found.

Necropsy ﬁndings of acute mercurial poisoning are
severe gastroenteritis and nephritis. The gastric mucosa
is edematous and, even after washing, has a dirty ap-
pearance because of the adherence of content particles
to the mucosal surface. The cortices of the kidneys are
extremely congested.

Chronic mercury poisoning, or mercuralism, is char-

 

acterized by incoordination and anorexia, followed by
blindness, and, ﬁnally, paralysis. Albuminuria is a con-
stant ﬁnding in mercurial poisoning.

. Gross lesions observed in Chronic mercurial poisoning
Include necrotic enteritis involving the cecum and colon,
and nephrosis. The meninges and brain are usually
severely congested. The presence of mercury in the
tissues and gastrointestinal contents of a poisoned animal
is generally not difﬁcult to detect. The Reinsch test is
a sensitive test for mercury and may be employed on
raw homogenized tissue samples, gastrointestinal con-
tents, or urine.

Mercury is not a normal trace element in domestic
animals and should not be present in the tissues of
animals in concentrations greater than 0.2 p.p.m. under
normal conditions. Therefore, concentrations in excess
of 1 p.p.m. found in the liver and kidney tissues on a
wet basis must be regarded with suspicion—R. H.
Singer, College Station, Texas.

Corticosteroids for Control of Asthma

Corticosteroids by mouth have been used extensively in treatment of
chronic bronchial asthma in man. There are, however, two disadvantages
to treating chronic asthma with oral corticosteroids. First, having started
treatment it is seldom possible to discontinue it, and severe attacks are
particularly apt to follow attempts at weaning from long-term treatment.
Second, the doses required are not without undesirable side-effects—par-
ticularly suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress
and a reduction in plasma-cortisol levels even when small doses are given.
When larger doses are needed, moon-face, excessive weight gain, decreased
resistance to infection, osteoporosis, and, in children, impairment of growth,

sometimes occur.

Attempts have been made to control chronic asthma with corticosteroid
drugs that can be inhaled, because, when given by this route, the amount
of drug which is effective is many times less than that required by mouth.
For example, 100 pg. of the bro-nchodilator salbutamol by aerosol is roughly
equivalent to 4 mg. of the drug by mouth. However, although conditions

improved when cortisone or

hydrocortisone was administered by aerosol,

there was no objective improvement seen in a double-blind investigation

using hydrocortisone hemisuccinate powder by aerosol.

Dexamethasone-

sodium-Zl phosphate by aerosol also brought about good control of respira-
tory symptoms, but there was signiﬁcant systemic absorption and it ap-
peared to have little advantage over corticosteroids by mouth.

Now a preparation
pionate by aerosol—has
and, in the recommended dose,

of a corticosteroid drug—beclomethasone dipro-
been introduced which has greater topical activity
it does not depress plasma-cortisol levels.

The drug is inhaled from a metered aerosol container delivering 50 pg. of

the drug in a liquid prope
tions 3 or 4 times a day,

prednisone or prednisolone orally daily.

llent and the recommended dose is two inhala-
which is equivalent to approximately 7 mg. of

Veterinary Pathology

This book was designed as a text for students in veter-
inary pathology and as a reference for veterinarians and
others interested in the study of disease. It is a monumen—
tal task to sufﬁciently cover such a broad topic in one vol-
ume, to have adequate illustrations, references and indexes
and yet to have the text written in a highly readable style.
The authors deserve commendation for a job well done.

Organization of the book has changed little from previ-
ous editions. The ﬁrst several chapters are devoted to gen-
eral pathology and neoplasia; the middle portion deals
with diseases caused by various agents and inﬂuences. The
last section relates to the various systems of the body. The
organization presents some problems to those studying and
teaching systemic pathology. If one attempts to study the
book in the order presented, much basic information relat-
ing to the various systems has not been discussed when
certain diseases are covered. If a course in systemic pa—
thology follows one in general pathology, extensive refer-
rals must be made to previous portions of the text.

When one compares this edition to the previous one,
one cannot help but be impressed by the additional infor-
mation and references in nearly every section of the book.
This is testimony not only to the increasing complexity of
veterinary pathology but also to the competence and dil-
igence of the authors. Especially welcome is the concise
material on cellular ultrastructure and the introductory
sections in the greatly expanded chapters on viral diseases
and poisons. Improvements are especially apparent in the
discussion of topics such as inﬂammation, photosensitiza-
tion, anemia, blood coagulation and immunity. Revision
of the chapter on the urinary system was badly needed.
The inﬂuence of Dr. Hunt is particularly noticeable in the
additional coverage of diseases of laboratory animals,
especially primates.

Veterinary Pathology will continue to serve the student
well. The book can be enthusiastically recommended for
practitioners, teachers, and researchers in animal disease.

SLEIGHT

Diseases 01‘ Feedlot Cattle

This book is the only one on this subject that is known
to this reviewer and, therefore, ﬁlls a void. It was written
by the happy combination of a competent pathologist turned
administrator and a practitioner with extensive feedlot ex—
perience. The former had the resources of a distinguished
college of veterinary medicine at his disposal; the latter has,
by experience, ﬁltered out from theory what will work under
feedlot conditions. The excellent photographs and photo-
micrographs are obviously the work of a teacher of veter-
inary pathology with an extensive clinic, necropsy facility,
and histopathology laboratory at his disposal.

The book has been Updated by the addition of chapters
on preconditioning and on control of pollution problems
from cattle feedlots. New conditions covered are bluetongue,

490

necrotic posthitis, and high mountain disease. A new chap—
ter on diseases caused by rickettsiae and chlamydia has
been added but the diseases covered have merely been
moved from the other chapters. For some reason, the au—
thors discuss actinomycosis under diseases caused by bac—
teria rather than in the chapter on fungi.

Evidently the authors do not subscribe to the widespread
effects of Hemophilus solnnus (infectious thromboembolic
meningoencephalitis) in cattle, although the underlying
basis for. these lesions, vasculitis with thrombosis, is well
described. The work of Panciera and his group is referred
to in the bibliography but that of the Iowa State group goes
unnoted.

Perhaps, being a pathologist, Dr. Jensen can be excused
for devoting sevenpages to tuberculosis, which is hardly an
important disease in feedlot cattle. Also, his close associ-
ation with research on high mountain disease explains an
equal amount of space devoted to that subject, which is of
restricted importance. It would seem that, in contrast,
lactic acidosis, hemophilus infection, and [BR would warrant
more space. Some facts concerning certain diseases are
repeated in various places in the discussion of the given
disease, possibly due to an overlap of assignments by the
authors.

Perhaps more emphasis should have been placed on the
necessity of calling state or federal regulatory veterinarians
when vesicular diseases are encountered. Veterinarians
would also be well advised to recheck on the most recent
Food and Drug regulations regarding withdrawal times,
permitted medications, etc., before following treatments
recommended in the text. This point is mentioned in the
book, but veterinarians should be aware of the necessity of
staying current on the continually changing regulations.

The publisher has done a good job with binding, paper
is of high quality and the typographical and spelling errors
are minimal.

This book is well worthwhile and should be part of the
library of any veterinarian connected with cattle practice-
Feedlot operators will ﬁnd it useful, if for no other reason
than to convince them of necessity of professional assistance
in making differential diagnoses. Drs. Jensen and Mackey
are to be congratulated on their success in keeping thell‘
book up to date and of continuing excellence—[Diseases

(Continued from preceding page)

Radiologic Diagnosis—Enlarged gas-ﬁlled stomach and small and large
intestines distended with gas; mass in left side of thorax, with decreased
lung area.

Comment.—Exploratory laparotomy revealed gastric torsion, with her-
niation of the spleen through the left crus of the diaphragm. Following re-
positioning of the stomach and spleen and surgical correction of the dia-
phragmatic hernia, the cat made an uncomplicated recovery.

Eye Worms from Animals

A 29-year—old Canadian woman had complained of intermittent distur-
bances of peripheral vision in her left eye for about 6 years. Her earliest
symptoms had been the appearance of “squiggly black lines that moved.”

In 1971, vision in the eye began to worsen. Then, one December day,
while looking toward the sky, she became aware of a shadowlike spot ob-
scuring her central vision in the left eye. She described it as having very
deﬁnite wormlike movements. The cause proved to be a yellow-white larva,
approximately 500 by 250 n, at the macula within the retina. Size, appear-
ance, and movements were typical of a trematode larva found in frogs. The
patient, it turned out, had for most of her life engaged in her family’s tra-
ditional catching of frogs and at-home preparation of the culinary delicacy.

Deep-frozen specimens of frogs’ legs from her refrigerator were examined,
and larval stages of a trematode were found. The tentative conclusion: that
the larva had entered her eye while she was preparing frogs’ legs for cooking
probably as she wiped her eye with her hand. ,

The larva, visible with the direct Ophthalmoscope, was destroyed by
direct and surrounding argon laser treatments and steroid therapy.

In another case, a fox tapeworm (Taenia crassiceps) was found in a hu-
man eye. The intraocular parasite was removed surgically, using a micro-
cry0probe.—Med. World News, 13, (Oct. 20, 1972): 70D.

It’s a Matter of Ethics

In an effort to provide guidelines for veterinarians engaged in mass im-
munization of pet animals, the AVMA Judicial Council adopted the fol-
lowing annotation to the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics, with sub-
sequent approval of the House of Delegates in 1972. TheCouncil considered
views expressed by both the Council on Veterinary Service and the Council
on Biological and Therapeutic Agents about this matter and agreed that
the following annotation is consistent with the opinions Of those councils:

 

Vaccination Clinics ,

Deﬁnition.———The term vaccination clinics applies to either priVately or publicly sup-
ported activities in which veterinarians are engaged inmates immunization of pet
animals. Usually, animals are brought in to points of assembly by their owners or
caretakers in response to a notiﬁcation that immunization serv1ces W111 be available.

Characteristically, these clinics do not provide the Opportunity for the participating vet~

erinarians to (1) conduct a physical examination of the individual animals to be im-
munized, (2) obtain a history of past immunization or prior diseases, or (3) advrse

individual owners on follow-up immunization and “health care. . ,

Scientiﬁc and Technical Considerations.—-—~Whereas rabies immunization for, the pur.
pose of public health protection can be satisfactorily achieved. m .a vaccination clinic,
the effectiveness of vaccination clinics for canine distemper and hepatitis .immunlza-
tion for the individual patient is hampered by biological variables. Examination of 1nd1~
vidual animals and acquisition of histories are essential steps in assuring proper immu-

nization against these latter diseases. ;

Distribution of Printed Materials.-——Some degree of advertising is inherent in the
distribution, at a vaccination- clinic, of professional cards and Similar materials bearing
the veterinarian’s name or the name of his hospital. Such a practice IS therefore 1n-

consistent with the Principles of Veterinary Medical Ethics.

medication, effectiveness, safety and convenience should 'be
your prime concerns. In soluble powders, you have a chOIce
of three types: Chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline and tetra-
cycline. All are accepted as being efficacious and safe when
used as directed. But of the three, tetracycline has one
significant characteristic important to your water medication
programs: greater solubility. The preference of tetracycline
over oxytetracycline and Chlortetracycline in human mediCine
has been clearly established. Far more prescriptions are
written for tetracycline than for oxytetracycline, and tetracy-
cline is prescribed over Chlortetracycline more than 600 to 1.

Dear.Hr. Hungron,

I wes pleased to learn that you are uilling to consider our
proposal that another non-profit humane organisation join our booth
exhibit at the AVML convention.and in so doing share the costs
involved.

The Humane Society of the united States has grown increasingly
interested in humans education. This would not be a pioneer project
as it was done several months ago at another convention and was
highly successful. If you approve, it would be nice to have a sign
reflecting the name of each organization as was done at our last
Joint effort.

Should you need any further information I will be glad to
supply it.

Wh continue to be grateful to reach the audience of the
respected members of the AVMA. Looking forward to a favorable reply,

I an
Sincerely yours,

HiMORANDUM

 

TO: AVMA EXHIBITORS-~PHILADELPHIA, 1973
FROM: R. G. VONGREN, AVHA CONVENTION MANAGER

SUBJECT: SPECIAL INFORMATION FOR EXHIBITORS

The attached Service Folder for exhibitors has been prepared to provide
you with all information and sources required for shipping, installing,
decorating, operating and removing your display and equipment in the 1973
AVHA Convention and Exhibit. Familiarization with the enclosed material
will enable you to anticipate your requirements and costs well in advance
and to minimize last minute confusion.

Please see that this information is read and understood by all of your
booth personnel. If there are any questions, please feel free to discuss
them with me anytime before you begin set-up of your booth. It is our
belief that if each exhibitor is aware of the rules and regulations
governing the use of the Philadelphia Civic Center, he will not encounter
any unpleasant situations.

~Labor jurisdictions in the Philadelphia Civic Center are well established.
These, however, should pose no problems if you know in advance what you
can and cannot do. Here then are some pertinent suggestions that should
be helpful to you:

1. Erection and Dismantling, All booths must be erected and dismantled
of Booths by local union personnel. If one man
cannot physically handle the job, two
or more must be hired. The exhibitor is
not permitted to help a union employee
in lieu of hiring an additional man.

 

2. Advance Labor Orders ‘ Labor may be ordered in advance in
either of two ways~~with supervision
or without supervision. If you order
labor without supervision, then the labor
group is under the exhibitor's responsi-
bility, supervision and control.

 

If the exhibitor orders the package
supervised set—up plan, Hanncraft Exhibitors
Service will then install your booth

whether or not you are present. Under

these conditions, labor is under

Hanncraf t ' s responsibility, supervision and
control, and they are reSponsible for

doing a quality job for you.

Special Information for Exhibitors, Philadelphia, 1973, Fans 2

..3 V

3. Product Arrangement Union labor is not required to unpack,
place on display, or repack the exhi»
bitor's own products (unless they require
assistance, such as carpenters, riggers,
etc., as with large equipment.)

4. Electrical Electricians are not required to plug
in booth lighting as long as the lighting
is originally supplied with the booth.
Exhibitors are reminded that if you have
back panel lighting or something of this
sort built into your exhibit, you'll need
an outlet. To avoid multiple connection
changes, leave all lights connected to
one junction box. Likewise, all motors
should be connected to a single. separate
junction box. Specially built displays
and panels must have electrical wiring
accessible for inspection and trouble shooting
at all times; they must be accessible from
sides or rear and not solidly built~in.

5. Set:0p Days Remember—~only one day is available for
installing exhibits-~Honday, July 16 from
8:00 am to 10:00 pm. Overtime rates will
prevail before 8:00 am and after 4:30 pm.

 

6. Hand-Carried Items Exhibitors may carry into the exhibit hall
small packages, cartons, and personal
belongings. This does not mean that an
exhibitor may use the truck dock facilities
to unload his personal car, truck, or
station wagon one piece at a time. All
truck docks are under the control of the
official drayage contractor, and this is
necessary for the total efficient movement
of freight in and out.

7. Insurance Exhibitors are responsible for their own
equipment and personnel. Therefore, it is
expected that they purchase adequate insur—
ance to protect themselves against all perils

8. No Tipping Many exhibitors make the big mistake of
expecting a tip to speed up or improve
service. It destroys good service. Don't
do it. When you have a problem getting
work done, report it to the Service Desk.
They are the only ones who can speed up the
job.

 




 




Special Information for Exhibitors, Philadelphia, 1973, Page 3

9. Equipment Order your services and equipment early,
before you get to Philadelphia. If you
wait until you get there, it will result
in delays, premium time costs, and
headaches for everyone. Contractors do
not have crystal balls. Nor can they
operate on the basis of “guesstimates”.
Advance orders can eliminate these problems.
They make the job easier, more efficient,
and less confusing to all concerned.

Exhibitor Badges Don't forget to pick up your registration
badge or badge~holders at the Exhibitor's
Registration Desk. These are required
during installation.

 

Merchandise Removal A written release is required to remove any
equipment from the building after the first
day of installation through the last day
of removal. This is for your protection.
Releases are available from the Exhibitor's
Service Desk, and must be filled out in
detail and approved by the exhibitor.

 

12. Security . Guard service will be provided by the AVHA
on a 24~hour basis from move-in to move~out.
Every reasonable protection will be taken
to protect your property. However, neither
the AVHA, its service contractors, the
management of the Philadelphia Civic Center
nor any of the officers, staff, members
or directors of any of the services
are responsible for your preperty in the
event of theft, damage by fire, accident,
vandalism or other causes.

Exhibitors may mare arrangements at the
Service Desk to safeguard valuables during
the hours when an exhibitor’s booth is
unattended, but the exhibitor must make
the effort to see that such valuables are
placed in the room provided for that pur~
pose and properly accounted for.

13. Labor Performance VERY IHPORTANT: Don't discuss union
problems with union representatives. The
assignment of labor, and its supervision
is the responsiblity of Manncraft Exhibitors
Service. If you are unhappy with the labor
assigned to you, report it immediately to f
the Service Desk in order that changes
can be effected.

 

 

We are confident that if you will follow these suggestions, you will have a most
Successful experience at AVHA 73. Your cooperation will be greatly appreciated.
