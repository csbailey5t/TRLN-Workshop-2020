Dear Dr. Glieeon.
Thank you very much.for your letter and helpful comments for
the next edition of "Basic Care of Experimental Animale.? They

will be incorporated.

I assume that beyond the-addition of nitrons oxide and enflurane
no other substances should, in your opinion, be added.

If you would be interested in reading through the entire text
for other possible changes. please let me know, and a copy of the
current edition will be sent you.

Your kind assistance is much appreciated both with regard
to this publication and in distribution of "Physical and Mental

Dear Ms Stevens:

I have reviewed Chapter VIII information sent to me.
The drug dosages I am familiar with are correct. I
have written in a few additions that I feel are worth
mentioning, and you can evaluate their value for inclusion
in the chapter. Even though this publication concerns
animal welfare, I feel that you should alert research
investigators and their employees to potential biohazzards
to themselves when using certain anesthetic drugs
(cf. footnotes in table).

I would appreciate a c0py of this publication when it
is complete. Also, I would again thank you for the copies
of your publication "Physical and Mental Suffering of
Experimental Animals" which I received. They are to be
distributed to our research faculty for reading.

VIII. THE USE OF PRE- AND POST-OPERATIVE ANALGESICS
IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL MEDICINE

It is common practice in clinical veterinary medicine to use analgesic drugs
before and after surgical anesthesia. The purpose of these drugs is to reduce
the sensibility of the animal and hasten induction of anesthesia, as well as to
cause a smooth recovery. It seems that these drugs should be used more than
they are in experimental medicine and surgery. Some of these drugs alter the
physiologic response of the animal to stimulus. Therefore, the pharmacologic
action as well as the investigator’s experimental design must be understood.
Carefully chosen analgesic drugs before and after surgery relieve pain, fear
and shock, thereby aiding in the humane handling of animals as well as reduc-
ing surgical risk. It is indeed true that good scientific technique and humane
treatment are so closely allied that they are inseparable.

Some of the drugs useful as pre-and post-operative analgesics or sedatives
are the tranquilizers, (e.g., Acepromazine and Tranvet), the opiates (Mor-
phine, Innovar-vet and Demerol)*, the barbiturates, and Atropine. The tran-
quilizers and opiates reduce conscious sensory perception and therefore allevi-
ate fear and reduce the amount of intravenous or inhalant anesthesia needed
to accomplish proper surgical depth. These drugs also reduce the severity and
length of the excitement stage during the recovery periods. Many surgical
endeavors can be nullified if the excitement stage during anesthetic recovery
is not mitigated.

*Morphine is not recommended for cats. It can cause extreme excitement in this Species.

 




Use of Pre-mzd Post-Operative Analgesics 17

Atropine and the tranquilizers reduce secretion (i.e., saliva and bronchial
mucous). Furthermore atropine dilates the bronchials, and these effects benefit

respiration.

Care must be exercised when the analgesics are used before anesthesia
for they potentiate some anesthetic agents. Certain emergency antidotes should
be available in case of respiratory depression or cardiac failure. It would be
well to investigate and determine precisely which drugs are recommended to
overcome the effect of each individual analgesic or anesthetic.

Tranquilizers are most practical to use, and they can be readily given
by mouth. The untoward effects (mentioned in the foregoing paragraph)
are much less likely to occur if the drug is given by mouth. Dosage should
be determined by reading insert brochure and /or label on bottle, or seeking
the advice of knowledgeable laboratory personnel. Post-operative pain should
be relieved with appropriate drugs.

Sernylan (Phencyclidine Hydrochloride) is an effective means of render-
ing monkeys and apes calm and tractable. It should never be used as a general
anesthetic; however, it enhances the action of the barbiturates providing an
excellent pre-anesthetic.

Summarizing:

(1) It is necessary that scientific investigators understand and use anal-
gesics for the relief of pain; this is important for scientific as well as humane
reasons.

(2) It is important to know that deep depression and death can occur
if the analgesics are overdosed, and to understand emergency procedures
necessary to correct the effects of overdosage. Sometimes this may only re-
quire increased or better ventilation or gentle artificial respirationw pﬂx MO 70 0477?”

(3) The oral route is an efficient and practical method to employ for
safe administration of tranquilizers, and of barbiturates given animals to make
them calmer and more comfortable.

(4) Unlike narcotics, the use of tranquilizers requires no narcotics license
or Federally regulated accounting procedures.
