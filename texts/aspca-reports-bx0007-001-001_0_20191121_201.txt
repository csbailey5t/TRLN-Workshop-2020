TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT

HEADQUARTERS OF THE SOCIETY, .
COR. FOURTH AVENUE AND TWENTY-SECOND STREET,
NEW YORK, FEB. 25TH, 1878.

PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS;
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SOCIETY:

It is once more my honor and privilege to report to you
the continued prosperity and progress of the Institution
over which I have so long presided ; and, let me hope, tO
your satisfaction.

“To err is human,” but I indulge the belief, that as a
consequence of the experience of so many years of per-
petual labor-in the work we advocate, errors are now of
rare occurrence. Deeply impressed with the paramount
importance of so directing the operations of the Society,
as to ever keep within the conﬁnes of law, I have pre—

 




  

 

 

 

6

ferred in many instances to sacriﬁce its spirit to the more
pronounced letter thereof. By so doing, our opponents,
who have appealed to the higher courts of this State, in
the hope of obtaining decisions against our action, have
been invariably defeated; and it is with no little pride that
I enumerate several of the more important rulings in our
favor: '

Marine Court—Justice Shea: against arrest of our ofﬁ—
cers, while in discharge of their duties.

Marine Court—Justice McAdam :
“Pigeon shootings are illegal assemblages.”

Common Pleas—Justice Joseph F. Daly:

Vacation of Injunction obtained by omnibus proprietors.
Common Pleas Justice Larremore :

Hog slaughterers. Injunction vacated.

 

While it is true that every Statute enacted by the
Legislature of the State becomes a law of the land,-it is
equally true, that precedence gives sanction and conﬁr-
mation of its authority, just as gold is puriﬁed by the oper—
ations of ﬁre.

FINA JVCES.

The wholesome policy which has been practiced, with
regard to the ﬁnances of the Society, ever since its ﬁrst
organization, has been rigidly adhered to, namely, that of
keeping out of debt. In this particular, your Society fur-
nishes to all other institutions a commendable example.

Under this head, it is proper to allude to the charges
which are imposed on the Real Estate of the Society, by
the city government, and which it seems to me should be
remitted, in View of the important services of a material,
as well as moral character, which it gratuitously renders.

 
    
  
  
  
 
 
 
    
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

 

 

 




 

 

CAN ALS.

The abominable phase of brute torture, deliberately
inﬂicted on the miserable creatures which are made to
drag the boats on the canals of this State, still exists, and
will continue, so long as juries before whom the offenses
are brought for adjudication, remain deﬁant of law, and
insensible to the responsibility of their oaths.

In order to strengthen their appeals, our agents have
repeatedly exhibited the raw and bleeding animals to .
the callous moral sight of these supposed conservators of
law and justice; only to be rebuked for the performance
of their humane duty, and then behold the wretched ani—
mals immediately restored to their wonted torture! By
the Annual Report of the Hon. John D. Van Buren, jr.,
State Engineer, on the condition of the canals—a copy of
which he has been so kind as to forward to us-——some ad-
ditional testimony is furnished. After a most able and
exhaustive scientiﬁc analysis of the subject, and a com-
parison of our system with that of Europe; disclosing the
facts that the labor imposed upon the canal horses of this
State is far in excess of the former, and that they are
much smaller in size; he thus concludes :

“The condition in which the horses employed on the
canals are kept is very bad economy, to say nothing of its
being a disgrace to our civilization.” And yet, strange as
it may seem, these same soulless transportation companies
have actually demanded of the Legislature, that the hu-
mane Statutes of the State shall be inoperative in their
case!

S WILL JIIILII.

This ﬂuid still continues to be one of the preferred
beverages of the citizens of Long Island, and in deference

 

 




  

8

to the popular aphorism— Vow popali supremo lead—we
have determined not to interfere furtlierwith their enjoy-
ment of it.

VI VISE CTI 0N .

The tragedies of the “Dissecting Boom ” are still need—
lessly performed, in the name of Science; although it is

claimed by the managers that, in deference to public sen-
timent, anaesthetics are employed.

TRANSPORTATION 0F CATTLE.

The purposes of the convention lately held at Cleve—
land, Ohio, have been given expression to by a bill, care—
fully prepared by Hon. E. T. Gerry, counsel to your
Society, which it is believed embraces the Wishes ‘of that
body, and it is hoped will meet the approval of the present
Congress, where it now awaits enactment. ‘

GL ANDERS.

A bill was also prepared by Mr. Gerry, and introduced
to the Legislature by him, tending to the extermination

of this fearful scourge. This bill has just been passed by
the Legislature.

PIGEON SHOOTING.

This “ sport,” as it is mistakenly called, is still indulged
in, outside of this county, by a class of sportsmen, however,
it is believed, socially speaking, of lower degree than form-
erly. The substitution of the glass ball, by those emi—
nent marksm en, Bcg irdus and Payne,~has gone far to satisfy
the votaries of blood and mutilation of the fact, that skill

and pleasure do not necessarily depend on the, inﬂiction
of pain.

 
    
 
 
 
   
  
  
   
 
   
   
   
  
  
   

 

  

 




 

 

 

FOX H UN TING .

This aristocratic pastime of the English nobility has
been introduced into our State recently, by the jezmessc
dorée of our city, with pronounced ill—success; being a
delicate exotic, not quite adapted .to our rigorous, common
sense climate. The disappointment and vexations of the
reﬁned ditch and fence jumpers, at the humiliating failure
to plant it on our soil, may be easier imagined than de-
scribed. It is true, that so far as dress, numbers, and
noise constitute success, the enterprise left little to de-
sire; but then, there were a few stubborn facts, which
obtruded their hateful preSence into this patriotic enter-
prise--namely, the foxes were too cunning for their intel-
ligent pursuers; they had parted with their wild instincts,
by reason of long sojourn near civilized life, and hence it
became necessary to procure a substitute, which would be
acceptable to the intelligent noses of the hounds.

The gentlemen were equal to this trying emergency, and
the result was, that a bag of aniseseed was for a time sent
ahead of the hounds; but this scent not entirely meeting
the approval of the friendly animals, a red herring was
next provided, which humiliating amendment was accepted
by the dogs, and for a short time thereafter the terriﬁed
farmers of Long Island suffered their fences to be torn
down, and their crops trampled upon ; until, at length, one
of them,'more bold than the others, sallied forth with a
cotton umbrella in his hand, and elevating it above his
head, at the moment a leading sportsman was about scal-
ing a fence, his terriﬁed horse suddenly disencumbered
itself of its rider, and landed him upon his head, causing a
rent therein, which, it is said, may some day occasion the
appointment of a commission d6 lunatico inquirendo.

BEJVCH 8H0 W'.

011 the 8th May last, a grand exhibition of rare and
beautiful dogs was held at the Hippodrome, under the
inspection and management of the “ Westminster Kennel
Club.” It was unquestionably the most interesting dis-
play of the canine race ever seen in this country, and was
the mest pronounced success ever witnessed. ,For many
days the vast structure where it was held was literally
packed with an admiring populace, and the contiguous
streets were almost blockaded by the carriages of our
wealthy families. As a Consequence, the money receipts
were enormous, but, as the gentlemen who were, the pro-
moters of this unprecedented spectacle had not inaugu-
rated it with a view to pecuniary gain, the amount received
was disbursed in premiums and expenses; the very hand—
some sum of $1,297.25 having been voted to your Society,
to aid in creating a dog-shelter whenever a suitable sum
shall be obtained.

OFFICIAL LEJVI T Y.

All the most eminent jurists agree, that the suppression
and prevention of crime is best effected by the certainty
and dispatch with which justice is administered. There
are many magistrates, however, who act under the errone-
ous impression that deliberate violation of law is morally
improved by a free use of lenity, and by their inadequate
impositions of penalties; practically constitute themselves
the advocates of offenders, and thereby cast a reproach on
the law-making power. I shall content myself with merely
citing two or three cases in illustration.

John Gullary, proprietor of N o. 73 Montgomery Street,
a liquor saloon, was arrested January 13, 1876, along
with nine others, for ﬁghting dogs there. They were all

 

 

 

  




 

 

 

    

11

indicted by the Grand Jury; were tried, February 14, at
General Sessions, convicted and sentenced : Gullary to one
year in the Penitentiary; Fitzgerald (the barkeeper) one
year, and the rest to various terms, varying from one to
two months.

The evidence was very complete, the dogs being cap-
tured in the place, bearing marks of the ﬁght upon them,
and covered with blood and wounds.

Another case is that of one Charles Woods, residing at
149 East Eighty-ﬁrst Street, who was arrested November
16, 1876, for driving a horse attached to a milk-wagon, a
portion of whose tongue had been recently cut off. He
demanded trial by jury; was indicted by the Grand Jury,
and when called to the bar of the General Sessions, pleaded
guilty, and was sentenced to the Penitentiary for one year.
In both cases, petitions for pardon were presented to the
Executive, misrepresenting the facts, and the terms of the
sentences reduced accordingly.

The present Executive has directed that in future, no-
tices of such applications shall be given to the Society,
thereby precluding similar recurrences.

 

 

 




 

 

 

SECRETARY’S REPORT.

THE prosecutions by the Society, resulting in convic—
tions, under the Statutes for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, have of late years considerably increased in
number; not, however, in consequence of offenses occurring
more frequently than formerly; but solely owing to the
more enlarged and ever-enlarging area of its operations in
New York State, added to the stricter vigilance of the
public in reporting cases to the Society. The terrible
sufferings of the horses and mules on the canals have for
years engaged the profound solicitude of the Society.
Wherever found practicable, Branches and Agencies have
been organized, with the view to remedying these outra—
geous abuses. The reports received from some of our
Branches and Agents along the canals give evidence of the
most deliberate and wanton cruelty on the part of the
owners, and those in charge of those miserable creatures.
The almost constant strain and exertion occasions agony
of the most terrible intensity—and in many cases, when
the exhausted creature’s strength fails, it is left on the tow
path or in the open ﬁeld by the side of the canal to die of
hunger and exposure. Personal inﬂuence is even em-
ployed by these greedy and inhuman persons and corpora-
tions, to defeat the humane exertions of the Society.

During the year 1877 the following cases were prose-
cuted:
'Working horses with sores upon their bodies chafed by the har-

ness ............ . ....................................... 222
Working lame horses ......................................... 149

Since the organization of the Society in 1866, it has
prosecuted 5,988 cases of ﬂagrant cruelty. Its Agents in-
terfered and prevented abuse of dumb animals upon 13,811
occasions. The Society receives on an average from citi-
zens, either verbally or by letter, annually, 1,200 com-
plaints of Violations of the law coming under their notice.

PRE VEN TI 01V OF THE AB USE OF
ANIJIIALS.

"During the same period, and in the cities of New York
and Brooklyn alone, the Agents of the Society prevented
the perpetration of cruelty, and abuse of animals on the
streets in 2,107 instances. The animals were suffering
from various causes; but in these cases there .was no evi—
dence of intentional cruelty on the part of the drivers, and
the evils were remedied, by the animals being relieved
from labor; and the drivers and owners were cautioned
not to repeat the offense. In only seven cases was
the warning disregarded, whereupon the offenders were
promptly arrested and punished by the courts.

The animals were employed as follows:

Horses attached to street cars .................................. 501
“ “ stages ...................................... 103
“ “ licensed vender wagons ....................... 224
“ “ express wagons ............................ 155
“ “ trucks and carts ............................ 953
“ “ coaches, cabs and “_night ‘owls ” .......... ,. . . 171
2,107

The animals were :
Disabled by reason of lameness ................................ 1,456
“ “ sickness .................................. ‘110
“ “ sores under harness ...................... 401
“ “ old age and unﬁtness for further work.. . . . 75
Overloaded ....................... . ........................... 65
Total ............................................. 2,107

The above ﬁgures do not comprise the zealous co-opera-
tion of members of the Society, Honorary, Special‘Agents,
and members of the Police Force, in interfering on behalf
of dumb, defenseless animals, no ofﬁcial reports of their
humane work reaching the Society, except in cases brought
before the courts for investigation.

committees of ladies and gentlemen, all earnestly helping
forward the good work. Their reports, as far as received
by the Parent Society, are subjoined.

BUFFALO, N. Y.——The Secretary of this Branch, reports
that during the year, seventy-four cases of cruelty to ani-
mals were prosecuted in Buffalo and its vicinity as fol-
lows: Working horses with sores under the harness un-‘
protected, 17; of these 13 were horses and mules working
on the canal with terrible raw and bleeding sores under
the collars; cruelly beating horses and mules, 6; starving
horses, cows, and dogs, 9; abandoning animals to die in
open lots, 2; working horses and mules suffering from
lameness or disease, 17 ; torturing, tormenting, or needless-
ly wounding and mutilating animals, 312 ; overdriving horses,
4; keeping cows in ﬁlthy condition, 2; carrying animals
in a cruel manner, 5. The Agents of the Branch had also
interfered and prevented a vast deal of cruelty being in-
ﬂicted upon animals, through the ignorance or carelessness
of those in charge of them.

 

 

POUGHKEEPSIE, N. Y.———This Branch reports the following
cases : Cruel exposure and depriving of necessary suste-
nance, 8 ; cruelly beating horses with sticks, clubs, etc., 11 ;
overloading teams, 6 ; working lame, sore, and disabled
horses and mules, 33 ; keeping horses and cows in a ﬁlthy
condition, 12; abandoning animals to die, 4; overdriving
horses, 4:; carrying animals in a cruel manner, 1 ; dog ﬁght-
ing 2 ; total, 81 cases. Animals condemned as unﬁt for
further use and humanely destroyed, 23.

 

SING SING, N. Y.———-The Secretary of this Branch reports
the following prosecutions : Fast driving and beating
horses, 4: ; carrying calves in a cruel manner, 1; working
horses with sores under harness, 2 ; overloading and beat-
ing horses, 3 ; cutting dogs’ ears, 2; beating a deer, 1 ; work—

ing a horse without shoes, 1 ; starving a horse, 1 ; beating
a mule, 1 ; needlessly killing a dog, 2. The Agent inter-
fered in twenty-one other cases, and warned the offenders
to be more careful in future.

DELHI, N. Y.~The Secretary reports a great change in
the treatment of dumb animals in this locality since the

formation of this Branch, one case only was prosecuted in
Court. ‘

BIVERHEAD, N. Y.—The Secretary reports, “Not a single
case of cruelty of sufﬁcient importance to take into Court.
Several cases remedied by admonition and. caution.”

ROCHESTER, N. Y.———During the year the “ Bergh Associa—
tion ” prosecuted 52 cases in Court. Of these, 34 were for
working horses and mules on the canal with galled shoul-
ders ; 5 for working lame horses; 1 for driving a horse
until it fell dead ; starving horses, 2 ; stabbing horse with
hay-fork, 1 ; beating a horse to death, 1 ; cruelty per-
petrated by a horse-tamer, 1; Overloading teams, 5; and
cruelly killing dogs, 2. The horse-tamer was ﬁned $50.
The friends of the cause. also interfered on 137 occasions,
and prevented acts of cruelty.

NYACK, N. Y.——The Secretary reports only one case pros-
ecuted in Court for working a horse with galled back under
saddle, but details numerous cases wherein. caution and
advice were given, and it is his opinion that the mere eX-
istence of the Branch “exercised a great moral inﬂuence,

A GENTS” REPOR TS.

The Society has one hundred and seventy—two Agents
working in various parts of the State of New York. A
large proportion of whom report that, whereas before
their appointment, cases of gross and wanton cruelty were
of almost daily occurrence, they now observe a most grati-
tying change for the better in their respective localities.
In large cities and towns the work, as appears from the
following reports, has still need of extraordinary energy on
the part of our Agents, but who, one and all, deserve the
warmest thanks of the Society for the zealous manner in
which they perform their onorous duties under circum-
stances sometimes beyond their control. It is to be lamented
that the cause does not receive the co-operation it deserves
from many of the local magistrates and juries. For eX-
ample, in a recent case in Queens County, a man was
charged with working a poor old, crippled horse. The
animal was exhibited to the Court and jury in evidence,
but the jury returned the following astonishing verdict:
“lVe ﬁnd the defendant not guilty; but the jury are of
opinion that the horse is not in a ﬁt condition for use! I ”

AMSTERDAM, MONTGOMERY 00., N. Y.——Mr. Michael Far-
rell, Agent, reports 14 cases prosecuted and convicted, as
follows : Cock-ﬁghting, 5 ; carryingrcalves in a cruel man-
ner, 3; cruelly beating horses, 2; overloading and over}
driving horses, 2; abandoning horses to die, 2; and 2
cock-pits destroyed.

CATSKILL, GREENE 00., N. Y.——-S. W. Stimpson, Agent,
states: “During the year I have labored hard to remedy
the evils of transporting calves, sheep, and swine with their
legs tied, and other inhuman modes of treatment in this

vicinity. I have examined over one hundred cases, and
found the offenders quite ignorant of the law, but very wil-
ling to adopt any other modes of transport suggested by

,’

me.

ELMIRA, CHEMUNG 00., N. Y.——Mr. B. A. Smith, Agent,
reports 88 prosecutions, as follows: Working lame horses,
5 ; beating horses, 3 ; pulling out tongue of horse, 1 ; dog—
ﬁghting, 5 ; overdriving horses, 2 ; working galled horses,
10 ; tying legs of calves and sheep, 10 ; mutilating dogs, 2.

CANTON, ST. LAWRENCE 00., N. Y.—-Mr. R. F. Harrison,
Agent, reports : “ During the year I have received numer—
ous complaints from different villages and towns in this
County, and have personally visited the localities and
remedied the evils complained of. I have traveled over
three hundred miles outside of my town in the interest of
our cause. In this town, I prosecuted the following cases
inCourt: Depriving a horse of necessary sustenance, 1;
overdriving horses, 3; cruelly beating horses, 3; working
horses with sores under the harneSs, 2.”

LIBERTY, SULLIVAN 00., N. Y.——J. C. Fisk, Agent, reports :
“ Previous to my appointment as the Agent of your Society,
many farmers and others in this vicinity were in the habit
of overloading, and otherwise abusing their teams lame
and old worn-out horses could be seen in our streets
daily, and horses left standing for hours exposed to
stOrms unblanketed. Now, I am happy to say, things have
entirely changed. By making an example of a few, and
causing it to be generally known that I, should make it
my business to look after the interests of all dumb animals,
I have succeeded in accomplishing much good.”

and mules on the Erie Canal: “Team of horses towing
canal boat, one horse suffering from a sore on its breast
fourteen inches long and as wide as breast, and 011 one
shoulder a sore eight inches long. The other animal was
suffering from old, maturated wounds under the collar,
which was imbedded in the raw ﬂesh. The offender was
ﬁned twenty-ﬁve dollars. Captain Wood, of the boat E. D.
Parker, was also ﬁned twenty-ﬁve dollars for working a
mule With raw sores, eight inches long, on the shoulders
and breast. Captain C. Patrick ﬁned ten dollars for a
similar offense. In another case, the offender was ﬁned
ﬁfty dollars for causing a poor mule to be worked while
nearly the whole of that part of the neck and breast
whereon the collar pressed was raw and bleeding. The fore-
,going are only samples of many other cases of similar
barbarity, wherein arrests were made here and at other
points along the canal, and the offenders punished; but
not to the extent they merited." ‘ '

COHOES, ALBANY Co., N. Y.—Mr. Henry R. Dickey,
Agent, reports three arrests of canal-boat captains for
working animals with galled shoulders, and twenty—eight
cases wherein he had compelled the boatmen to change
horses, by reason of their disability from sores and galls
under the collars.

SCHENECTADY, SCHENECTADY‘ Co., N. Y.——Mr. F. V. De
Forest, Agent, reports the arrest of siX canal boatmen for
working horses and mules with badly galled shoulders.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COM-
MITTEE.

The Executive Committee, in view of the fact that the
Reports of the President and Secretary give the members
'of the Society and friends of the cause ample details of
the work done during the year 1877, and clearly demon-
strate the utility and importance of the Society, will con-
ﬁne themselves to alluding to the more important matters
coming particularly Within their jurisdiction.

Voted the best thanks of the Society to the Rev. W.
Alger, of the Church of the Messiah, Thirty—fourth Street
and Park Avenue, in appreciation of his kindness in
preaching an eloquent sermon in his church on the 4th of
February, 1877, on the subject of “ Cruelty to Animals.”

It is the painful duty of the Committee to report the
demise of that excellent gentleman, the late N. P.
HOSACK, who for many years was the Secretary of the
. Society. -

Also, the lamented death of JAMES BROWN, one of
the founders, and a Vice-President of the Society.

Also, the death of Mr. THOMAS COOPER CAMP-

BELL, a warm and zealous friend of the cause in the

 




 

  

37

Legislature of this State. His exertions while occupying
legislative position, endeared him to every friend of
humanity.

Wm,—

Suitable resolutions of condolence were passed, and
ordered to be engrossed, and forwarded to the families of
the deceased gentlemene

As this Report is going to press we received the painful
intelligence of the death of the Hon. Townsend I larris,
lately elected one of our Vice-Presidents, and for many
years an active member of the Executive Committee of
the Society. Mr. Harris once acted in the capacity of
United States Minister to Japan, and 011 account of the
highly satisfactory services rendered by him in cOncluding
a commercial treaty, which opened that country to the
world, received from his own government, and from foreign
nations, distinguished honors. He was also long and suc-
cessfully associated with public education in the State and
city; in short, his whole life seems to have been devoted
to the ornamental as well as useful, as his well-known
reﬁned and elegant manners proved to all who knew him,
and were admitted to his intercourse.

DRINKING HYDRANTS FOR MAN
‘ AND BEAST.

   

There is great need for additional hydrants in differ-
ent parts of our city. The Society has ﬁfteen already,
and continues to increase the number as often as its
funds allow. A most appropriate form of donation could
be make on the part of the friends of animals, by the
erection of fountains, under the direction of the Society,
bearing the names of the donors.

GLASS BALL SHOOTING.

THE DECLINE OF PIGEON SHOOTING.

Pigeon shooting is a relic of barbarism! As an amuse-
ment, strangely enough, its origin is due to Spain. The
same country which still makes bull ﬁghting a national
recreation, invented pigeon shooting in the beginning of
the seventeenth century.

If in England and America bull ﬁghting has been de-
clared prejudicial to public morals, and only ﬂourishes
in Spain, pigeon shooting as an amusement still ﬁnds
votaries in England, France, Italy, and the United States.

Let us be as charitable as possible, and suppose that
pigeons are not killed, through the desire of inﬂicting any
unnecessary cruelty on the birds, but only in order to
make the sportsman proﬁcient in wing shooting. For
every pigeon killed and put out of'misery, there is an-
other bird, which, maimed and crippled, lingers on in tor-
ture, sometimes for days.

Precision in the use of ﬁrearms, when a living target is
used, can only be acquired by the most revolting cruelty.

 




45

For the last few years, we are only too pleased to state,
that pigeon shooting has lost a great deal of its prestige.
The rather coarse example set by certain English gentle-
men of high rank, who were adepts in pigeon killing,
brought on them a rather questionable reputation as to
their humanity.

That certain improvement in public morals, which though
gradual is none the less powerful, declared, that the slaugh-
ter of innocent birds for amusement only, was at variance
with an advancing civilization. Various substitutes were
imagined, which would allow of the Sportsman’s acquiring
skill with his fowling—piece, other than by murdering birds.
We are pleased to call the attention of the Society to the
use of glass balls. Hollow spheres of glass thrown from
spring traps, are everyday coming more into use. The
most cultivated marksman in the world, declares that in
every respect the glass ball is superior to the pigeon. By
a very easy mechanical contrivance, glass balls can be
made to describe those uncertain ﬂights which pigeons
take. An Exhibition in New York, where Captain Bogar-
dus shot some 5,000 balls, publicly demonstrated, that as
a source of amusement, it required quite as much skill to
break glass balls as to shoot pigeons. _

We hail then, with satisfaction, this substitute for
pigeons, and believe that before many years one of the
most wicked of all cruel sports, that of pigeon shooting,
will be among the things of the past.
