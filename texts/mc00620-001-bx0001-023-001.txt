”that press for answer in each age.

The sayings of Jesus Christ display a tender
love for the Whole Qf His Heavenly Fathers

_ Creation—for the very ﬂowers and grass of the:
(field, to say nothing of Creatures which know

pain and suffering and which unmistakabfyt

exhibit affection to one another and lavish

upon us, their masters, a love and a loyalty

‘not infrequently lacking in our own kind

Some of His most lovely parables were. in~ ,
spired by close and sympathetic observation of”, _

‘animal life, His unqualiﬁed assertion that no " 7"
falling sparrow is forgotten before God ;

shatters every excuse that might be made for- -

any mishandling of the creatures entrusted to:

us by their Creator and ours. He dWells’
emphatiéally more than once on the Fathers

tender care for these; He teaches plainly that ‘
God’ 5 tender mercies are over 2222 his works.
and He holds up the Father’ 8 mercy before '
our eyes, as an example: “ be ye merciful as

your Father also is merciful.” Any love and

mercy that are conﬁned to mankind and take
no account of.the sub-human creation fall-far
Short of the love and mercy taught and exem~
plified by Jesus Christ. Imperfect indeed
would be a Gospel that affected man alone.

Not only must man be brought into harmony
with God and himself; he must also be brought "
into harmony with that natural world which he

' shares with the lower creatures and of Which

he is the impersonation, and with those fellow
creatures who share With him the unsolVed'
mystery of sentient existence. 1'.)

The traditions and literature dealing With?
the lives of the saints are full of Suggestions
and hints of a beautiful relationship existing
between these friends of God and His lower
Creatures. St. Francis of Assisi,th loved

all God’s creatures, in his beautiful childlike.-
piety, called them his clear brothers and sisters.

He did not regard these creatures as beyond

7 the limits of , God’s covenant, simply to be used
