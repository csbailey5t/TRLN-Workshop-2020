VIVISEOTION ENDANGEBS HUMAN
LIFE .

 

 

No. I.—PASTEUR GIVES HYDROPHOBIA TO
HUMAN BEINGS.

VIVISECTION has never yet been proved to have saved a
single human life. It has often been asserted to have saved
life, but when proof has been asked for, it has been nowhere
to be found. Vivisection cannot be justiﬁed on this ground.
On the contrary, it has cost the lives of many, both by leading
doctors to experiment on their patients, and by causing them
to form mistaken theories of disease and to adopt wrong
methods of treatment. Of the latter a striking instance is
offered in the hydrophobia experiments of M. PASTEUR.

M. PASTEUR began by claiming every case inoculated by
him as a cure if no hydrophobia ensued. When one of his
patients, LOUISE PELLETIER, died, he experimented with her
spinal marrow on rabbits, which died of hydrophobia twenty
days afterwards. This proved, he said, that she died from
the bite of the dog. If the rabbits had died in seven days it
would have proved, he said, that she died of the inoculations.

In October of last year a man named GOFEI died at St.
Thomas’s HOSpital of a peculiar form of hydrophobia after
being inoculated by M. PASTEUR by his later “intensive”
method. Rabbits were inoculated with his spinal marrow
and these died in SEVEN DAYS, thus proving that M. PASTEUR
had killed GOFFI with his inoculations. Soon after GOFFI’S
death, a young man, named ARTHUR WILDE, died at
Botherham in a very similar way, after having been inocu-
lated by M. PASTEUR. Seventeen others in France and other
Continental countries have died after being inoculated on the
intensive method, and ten of these have died of paralytic or
rabbit rabies. Appended is a full list. (See newt page.)

In the words of Professor PETER, of Paris, “M. PASTEUR
DOES NOT CURE HYDROPHOBIA ; HE GIVES IT.” It is high time
M. PASTEUR was put upon his trial for causing the deaths of
all these person's.

M. PASTEUR’S system, it is well known, is the outcome of
vivisection, and is only kept up by continual recourse to
vivisection. So long as it remained undiscredited it was held
up as the great justiﬁcation of vivisection. But now it is

proved that whilst upwards of 80 persons have died after
being treated with the “infallible cure,” at least twelve and
possibly nineteen of these owe their death directly to the
false teachings of vivisection.

No. II.——BRAIN SURGERY CLAIMS SEVERAL
VICTIMS.

Towards the close of 1884 some indiscreet friend of Dr.
HUGHES BENNETT wrote to the Times giving an account of the
“ one cure ” so long asked for by Anti-vivisectionists, in which
a life had been saved by vivisection. The writer, who signed
himself “ F.R.S.,” headed his letter “ Brain Surgery.” The
human brain has been the subject of accidents and operations
from time out of mind, but the case “ F.R.S.” alluded to was
peculiar in being the ﬁrst case in which a brain tmnom' had
been removed. And the particular point about it was that
its locality had been made out from the symptoms of paralysis
it had caused. This, it was said, had been rendered possible
only by FEERIER’S vivisections. _

It turned out afterwards that the tumour was not found at
the Spot where it had been expected, that the original opening
in the skull had to be enlarged in order to ﬁnd it; and so far
from the life having been saved, in 28 days from the date of
the Operation the unfortunate man was dead of inﬂammation
of the brain, the direct consequence of the operation. This
was the ﬁrst victim.

Soon after this case occurred there was another of a similar
kind at King’s College Hospital. In the British Medical
Journal, of May 16, 1885, it is alluded to by Professor
FERRIER, in the discussion which took place when Dr.
HUGHES BENNETT read a paper on the ﬁrst case. Professor
FERRIER diagnosed the tumour to be in a certain position,
and Sir JOSEPH LISTER operated. The tumour was not found.
The brain was cut into and ﬂuid escaped which was thought
to proceed from a ﬂuid growth. The man died in a week.
It was then found that one of the natural cavities of the
brain had been tapped, and that the tumour was in an
entirely different part of the brain. This was victim the second.

In the Lancet of April 16, 1887, Mr. BENNETT MAY reports
the case of a boy, C. H., aged seven, from whose brain he

 




 

6

extracted a tumour in October last. The boy died four hours
after the operation. This was victim the third.

In the British Medical Journal of April 23rd, Mr. VICTOR
HORSLEY gives a table of the cases he has operated on.
Many of them were not cases of brain-tumour, and the
diagnosis and treatment had nothing to do with vivisection.
The brain-tumour cases were the following :—

A man, T. W., aged 20, had a tumour removed on
June 22nd, 1886. No improvement followed, though the
patient survived.

J. H., a man, aged 38, had a tumour removed on Sep-
tember 23rd, 1886. Improved for a time ; but the symptoms
returned, and he died six months after the operation. This
may be called the fourth victim.

W. T., a man, aged 87, had a tumour removed De—
cember 7th, 1886, with the result that there was slight
increase of the paralysis he suffered from before the operation.

J. B., youth, aged 18, had a tumour removed on
December 17th, 1886. He died 19 hours after the operation.
This makes the ﬁfth Victim of Brain Surgery.

The last case was clearly unsuitable for operation. The
mental condition was good; there was no complete paralysis,
and the general condition of the patient pointed to the brain
trouble as being no isolated affection but part of a general
disease.

Whilst all these victims have paid the penalty of trusting
to vivisecting surgeons and physicians, those doctors who are
guided by experience at the bed-side, and the postmortem
room strongly deprecate interfering in such cases. This is the
conclusion come to by the most eminent authorities in France,
Drs. CHARCOT and PITRES, and it is the conclusion come to by
Dr. GOODHEART, who has examined, for the Pathological Society,
a large number of specimens taken from such cases after death.
The Medical Press, commenting on Dr. GOODHEART’S report,
says that if fatal cases of operations of the kind were brought
before a jury, the latter could do nothing less than bring in
a verdict of homicide against the surgeon who operates ; and it
concludes its article with these words: “ Then might FERRIER
as well have been beating the air as boring holes into the crania
of monkeys, or cutting slices out of their contents.”

Professor FERRIER had much better have been beating the
air, for then ﬁve human beings would not have been hurried
out of the world by adventurous and misguided surgeons
before their time.
