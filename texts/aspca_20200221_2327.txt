out the year are expensive — materials,
stamps, the time and energy of the staff in
preparation of the material, the printing,
the stufﬁng and addressing of envelopes can
quickly increase expenses.

I’m going into this in so much detail be-
cause of certain criticism directed at us
from a few of our followers who thought we
hadn’t sent out as many bulletins as other
organizations. Obviously these individuals
didn’t stop to realize that the groups they
referred to were educational or paper or-
ganizations, whose work in no way cor-
responds to ours. Such organizations do not
have our operational obligations because
they have no actual animals in their care.
Last year we handled 266,825 animals. The
care, the feeding, the placement of animals
in homes, the return of others to their
owners, the licensing of dogs in New York
City—these are our major responsibilities.
We do and will continue to prepare materials
on humane legislation along with our other
duties, but we cannot be expected to nor can
we concentrate on a particular area to the
detriment of other major parts of our broad
program of animal welfare and protection.

Within our limits, however, we pledge to
continue to wage a war for compulsory
humane slaughter legislation and we hope

you will continue to give us your fullest
support.

Services for Horses

For the last ﬁve years Mr. Gordon Wright
has given a beneﬁt horse show at Secor
Farms for the ASPCA. Three years ago he
suggested that the funds from this event
be given, at the rate of $300 a year, in
the name of the Society, as a scholarship
for a worthy student attending the New York
State Veterinary College at Cornell Univer-
sity. Last winter, when the scholarship had
been assured for a period of three years in
the future, plus the three-year period al-
ready paid for, Mr. Wright felt he could
guarantee it for a 25-year period. This is a
laudable and far-reaching contribution to
the entire ﬁeld of veterinary medicine.

Mr. Wright’s idea of a scholarship has
inspired another friend of the Society .to give
a second one for a veterinary student at
Cornell for a three-year period —Mrs. F. S.
Crofts of Stamford, Connecticut.

On the subject of horses, let me mention
the two national horsemanship trophies for
juniors offered by the ASPCA —the Alfred
B. Maclay and the Henry Bergh. The Maclay
Class was accepted by 133 shows the past
year, 12 more than the previous year—the
Bergh by 62.

The winner of the Maclay in the ﬁnals
at the National Horse Show last November
was J. Michael Plumb, of Syosset, Long
Island.

The winner of the Bergh—a handsome
Revere bowl donated by Gene Leone, the
popular restaurateur — is Miss Susan Archi-

bald of Allendale, New Jersey.

Placing second was Rebecca Harper, of
Hendersonville, North Carolina; third,
Wayne Carroll, of Port Chester, New York;
fourth, Carol Altman, of Rye, New York.
For the ﬁfth place there was keen com-
petition, three contestants having the same
score. We’ve decided to give a ribbon to

each —— Alice Frazer, of Battle Creek, Michi-

HOW TO
GIVE FIRST AID

TO INJURED PETS

Some day the life of your pet may de-
pend on your knowledge of ﬁrst aid. The
safest course in most emergencies is to get
the animal to a veterinarian. Cats, particu-
larly, are difﬁcult to treat and should be
wrapped in a blanket or coat, placed in a
low box and carried to the doctor. But cer-
tain basic principles may help you keep your
pet alive until the veterinarian can be
reached, or until your pet is out of danger.

 

Every household should have a ﬁrst aid kit
containing the following: Cot-ton, gauze

     

   

Wrap gauze 5* t.

Even the friendliest dog may try to bite
his owner while in pain. So, before giving
ﬁrst aid, muzzle your dog with a gauze

of cloth. Tie over the animal’s nose, cross
under chin and tie a knot behind the ears.

Harry J. Connolly

Connolly Named Manager
Of Brooklyn Shelter

Perhaps no one in the Society has had a
wider experience in animal work than newly
appointed Brooklyn District Manager Harry
J. Connolly, who started his career with the
ASPCA 22 years ago as a chauffeur.

Not only has he held practically every job
along the line in coming up from the ranks,
but he has worked in six of the Society’s
nine shelters. After

Acting District Manager during Mr. Ferris9
absence, spent a short time in Manhattan,
and even worked one day in Staten Island.
When the ASPCA’s Long Beach Shelter
opened in 1957 he was appointed Shelter
Manager, the post he held until he was put
in charge of the Brooklyn Ofﬁce this year.

He succeeds Charles R. Wadsley, who re-
tired as Brooklyn District Manager after 25
years of service with the ASPCA.

Since 1936 Mr. Connolly has cared for
thousands of animals, including dogs, cats,
horses, monkeys, snakes, birds, alligators and
even a boa constrictor. The boa incident oc-
curred several years ago, when the snake
escaped from a Coney Island side show and
he was dispatched to ﬁnd it and snare it.
He did, after slithering under a dozen build-
ings on the boardwalk.

One of the most heart-breaking tasks in
Mr. Connolly’s career occurred 15 years ago
when he had to humanely destroy 43 horses
that were badly burned in a stable ﬁre and
were beyond recovery.

The new manager, who lives in Brooklyn
with his wife, a daughter, 20, and a son, 15,
has many plans for his shelter. Built in
1913, it is larger than any other animal
shelter in the country. Last year it handled
71,901 animals. But Mr. Connolly hopes to
top that ﬁgure when current alterations are
complete.

 

ﬁve years as chauf-

   
  
     
 

feur he was made

special agent with the
job of investigating
cases, and
often served as Act-

Medal of Honor
The ASPCA Medal of Honor and Certiﬁ-

cate of Merit is always a popular award.
Sometimes it goes to an animal which has
performed an unusual act of bravery—
there were five last year; sometimes to a
human being—one child, seven men, one
woman during the year—who rescued an
animal from distress.

One such medal went to a plucky mixed
breed collie in Minnesota. Bob, the pet of
four-year-old Jon Lynott, fought a fang and
claw duel with a 35-pound bob-cat that had
jumped on the youngster, dragging the boy
to the ground. The dog held off the angered

cat until an ofﬁcer passing by shot the ani-
mal.

A county judge in Maryland received a
Medal of Honor for the unique sentence he
imposed on three teen-age boys charged
with torturing a boxer dog. Judge Emmet
H. Nanna, evidently a wise and practical
disciplinarian, sentenced the boys to a six-

34.

month tour of duty tending animals at the
local pound after school hours.

Another Medal of Honor award went to
nine-year-old Josephine Quattrocchi. On
March 17, the house in which Josephine
lived with her family on the ground ﬂoor
caught on ﬁre. Her older sister, Ida, return-
ing from a motion picture, smelled smoke
and warned 16 families in the apartment
house. All had reached safety when Joseph-
ine remembered her little pet, Cotton. Cotton
was in the burning house. Without fully
realizing the danger of re-entering the build-
ing, Josephine dashed from the arms of her
mother past ﬁremen, and ran back into the
ﬁre to save her kitten. Both returned un-
harmed, fortunately, and it was a pleasure to
present Josephine with the Society’s Medal
of Honor for her act of unselﬁsh bravery.

And on this happy note ends your Presi-
dent’s end of the year report for the ﬁscal

year which drew to a close on April 30,
1958.

 

Josephine Quottrocchi, 9, received Medal
of Honor for saving her cat Cotton in a ﬁre.

year ago, my report was devoted pri-

 

marily to expansion——a new Bronx
Shelter, a glass-enclosed pet adoption center
for the Brooklyn Shelter, our move into Glen
Cove and Long Beach, on Long Island. In-
cluded in this program of growth were two
incompleted projects -— the Elmsford Shelter
in Westchester and the Sydney H. Coleman
Animalport at New York International Air-
port.

The Elmsford Shelter, as you know, was
transferred to us by the Western West-
chester Humane Society. It’s a charming,
small shelter in an attractive woodland set-
ting. But it did need some repair, as well
as the addition of an apartment for the
caretaker and his family. Landscaping, a
rustic fence, new signs and lighting were
also part of a general overhaul which has
turned it into a real country home for ani-
mals. From it we service certain nearby
communities—Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry, Irving-
ton, Tarrytown, North Tarrytown and Mount
Pleasant.

Sydney H. Coleman Animalport

The Animalport, on the other hand, is the
culmination of an idea which grew out of a
discussion among a group of humane leaders
en route to Sydney H. Coleman’s funeral
over three years ago. For 21 years Mr. Cole-
man was the revered Vice-President of the
ASPCA, and it was natural and a well-de-
served honor to dedicate this ﬁrst stop-over
for airborne animals to his memory.

The opening ceremony on January 29 was
an impressive gathering of Mr. Coleman’s
friends, Port of New York Authority and
airline ofﬁcials, and humane society repre-

sentatives from various parts of the country.
Two bus-loads of photographers and re-
porters from radio, television and the press
covered the event. Invitations and a packet
of pictures, background material and a news
story had previously been sent to 450 major
sources of news across the country. The re-
sult was greater publicity than we have ever
had on any one story in the Society’s 92
years. We have received hundreds of clip-
pings from 32 states in the United States,
as well as England, Canada, Germany and
Italy.

The Animalport, open 24 hours a day, is a
$275,000 building located on a one-and-a-
quarter acre of land in the Air Cargo Center
of New York’s International Airport. It is
the Society’s ninth shelter, although it is set
up for a somewhat different purpose from
the others.

It was established to feed, water, exercise
and generally tend the needs of animals in
transit. If you are transporting an animal
to New York by air the ASPCA will meet
your pet at the plane, take it to the Animal-
port and care for it until you call to pick
it up. If you are sending a pet from New
York, we will provide crating directions,
secure a health certiﬁcate and deliver it to
a steamer or railway express ofﬁce.

Accommodations include 40 individual
tiled kennels for small animals, with outdoor
runs, 11 stalls for horses and other large
animals, with two adjoining outdoor pad-
docks, temperature-controlled areas for tropi-
cal birds and animals, isolation cages for the
sick or injured. An apartment on the second
ﬂoor is occupied by George Bauer, the Resi-
dent Manager, and his family.




 

in your tank. As many as ﬁve to ten vari-
eties will live in harmony.

The ﬁsh are divided into two basic groups,
live-bearers and egg-layers. Of the live-
bearers the guppy is the cheapest and easiest
to breed. Bright and colorfully marked, they
come in round-tail, lyre-tail and sword-tail
varieties, with the female about two inches
long and the male a bit smaller. The female
reproduces easily and frequently, producing
from 10 to 100 young. She becomes large
and two black patches can be seen on both
sides of the body near the tail.

Both live-bearers and egg-layers eat their
young, so expectant mother and eggs, usu-
ally deposited on plants, should be removed
to a separate tank.

Platies, plump round ﬁsh, come in colors
ranging from bright red to pale yellow. They
are graceful, beautiful and hardy. Sword-
tails often reach over two inches in length,
come in many colors, and are very active.
Mollies, particularly the jet black variety are
beautiful and amusing ﬁsh. They are also
efﬁcient algae eaters and will help keep the
tank clean of this minute plant which col-
lects on the glass. The mosquito, an olive
green ﬁsh, is the smallest live-bearer, the
male being less than an inch long.

Of the egg-laying varieties the black and
green angel, ﬂat in shape, is one of the
prettiest and most graceful, growing to a
diameter of four inches. One of the most
beautifully colored is the neon tetra which
glows with colors resembling neon lights.
The white cloud mountain minnow comes
from China. Its body is bluish-green and its
tail has tints of yellow and red.

Gouramis come in several varieties, the
dwarf gourami being best for a small com-
munity tank. It is small and ﬂat, colored in
red, blue and gold and swims upright. The
pearl gourami has a pinkish breast. The
kissing gourami, suited for a large tank,
is amusing to watch.

Siamese ﬁghting ﬁsh are beautiful and
friendly. There are blue, red, purple and
cream varieties, with long graceful ﬁns.

Silver and black striped zebra ﬁsh swim
close to the surface of the water and are
never still.

Every tank should have one or more
scavenger ﬁsh to eat what the others don’t
and thus keep food from decaying.

Feeding the Fish

Prepared food is available in pet shops.
Baby cereal, raw meat scraps and live worms
are also recommended for variety. A good
rule is never to feed the ﬁsh more than they
can eat in a few minutes. Uneaten food will
sink to the bottom Where it will decay and
foul the water. A feeding ring will conﬁne
ﬂoating food to one section of the tank. Feed
once or twice a day, but tropical ﬁsh can go
without feeding for several days.

Cleaning the Tank

When the tank becomes cloudy or when
algae collects on the sides the tank must be
cleaned. Uneaten food, dead plants and ﬁsh
droppings can be dangerous. Avoid pollu-
tion by careful feeding, feeding rings, scav-
enger ﬁsh, and a pair of snails which eat the
algae. A dip tube will enable you to suck
up debris from the bottom of the tank.

Automation, will of course do away with
the problem of dirty tanks forever. An air
pump, an aerator, a circulator and a ﬁlter
will do the job for you.

Ailments

Fish suffer from a variety of ailments,
but on the Whole, most of the better known
varieties are quite hardy. White spots, shiver-
ing, enlarged eyes, distended body (except
females) are symptoms of ﬁsh ailments.
There is not too much to be done for these
ﬁsh, except to remove them to a separate
tank, raising the water temperature slowly
to about 80 degrees.

But you should not have too much trouble
with sick ﬁsh if you follow the four essen-
tials: Suitable water, sufficient oxygen, cor-
rect temperature and correct feeding.

Obedience Training

> In the article “How to Teach Your Dog Good
Manners” in the spring ANIMAL PROTECTION, I
think the word jerk is too forceful a word to indi-
cate a small tug of the leash. I have watched
children with pets giving a very strong jerk almost
enough to break the poor animal’s neck.

Don’t you think a small harness is preferable to
a collar? And why do our pets have to be taught:
tricks? We don’t expect our children to do tricks
and a pet is just as much “one of the family.”

MRS. EDNA F. ORR
Brooklyn, N. Y.
Ed. Note:

You’re right. Tricks are not necessary for a
dog’s well-being. But good manners are. Just as it
is important for children to be well-behaved, so it
is important for a dog. A well-trained dog is a
better companion and a joy to live with. He will be
acceptable and welcomed wherever he goes.

Actually, correct training is a kindness and the
best treatment a dog can have. If done correctly,
no part of obedience training is painful, but a
strong tag is sometimes necessary to get a dog’s
attention.

Experts feel a collar is preferable, because a
harness can pull a puppy’s shoulders out of place
and wear away the coat.

Injured Dog

> Thank you for your courtesy and kindness in
picking up the dog of my son Charles and caring
for him after he was injured in an accident. The
dog is recovering rather well. I am sending a dona-
tion in appreciation.

Animalport

> Congratulations on the new Animalport at
Idlewild which is certainly an achievement, and I
was thrilled with the reading of it in your Spring
magazine. The rest of the magazine is delightful
reading and I enjoy every bit of it, as well as
reading the interesting advertisements. I wonder
why you hadn’t thought of this help before, which

14

I feel adds to the cause in telling people where
and what to get in the line of food, etc. for
their pets.

Dog License Helps

> Thanks for the prompt and courteous attention
given the call last night concerning a lost dog.
Because of the license and your help the dog was
returned to its home within the hour.

Adopted Pet

> Thank you for the nice dog I adopted from
the Bronx Shelter recently. We ﬁnd her a wonder-
ful pet. She is well behaved and my child is very
happy with her. Enclosed is an additional con-
tribution.
MAX NEIDICH

Pigeons Caught

> Recently on my way home I noticed a group of
people at the corner of 63rd Street looking at a
couple of pigeons crouched on a grating. I called
your ofﬁce from my apartment around the corner
and returned immediately. I don’t believe I was
there ﬁve minutes before your car arrived. The
most efﬁcient young man caught the pigeons appar-
ently without even scaring them and put them in
a box.

Two young boys were very upset about the birds
being taken away in a box. Your agent explained
that they were young birds which had probably
fallen off a ledge. He said it appeared that only
one was injured slightly and that the other one did
not want to leave his injured pal. The boys left
quite satisﬁed.

Congratulations not only for the speed with which
you responded to my call, but also for the intelli-
gence and skill shown by your agent.

York State Bar Association, which has re-
cently come to our attention. Called Do You
Need a W ill? it explodes several mistaken
theories the average person has about the
legality of Wills and sets forth, in language
any layman can readily understand, the rea-_

sons everYone needs a will and hows/“one

As a service to our members and con-
tributors the ASPCA has, for a nominal
sum, purchased a limited number of these

reserved for you. It will be mailed immedi-
ately If you will simply drop a postcard
asking for Do You Need a Will? to the

ASPCA, 441 East 92nd St., New. York 28.

We hope it will provide answers to some
of the questions you may have Iregarding
the full protection of your family, your
friends or the charities to which you may
Wish to leave your possessions. MaySWe also
voice the hope that the ASPCA is among
the latter?

Shock. Keep animal warm and
quiet, head lower than hindquarters.

 

Administering Medicine

To give an emetic or medicine to a dog
pull the lower lip out to form a pocket and
pour the liquid into the pocket from a paper
cup. To give the same dose to a cat wrap
him in a blanket or coat. Open the animal’s
mouth by pressing on either side and pour
liquid in. To give a tablet, force the mouth
open by pressing on either side of the upper
jaw. Hold the lower jaw open with the other
hand While you throw the tablet as far back
into the mouth as possible. Close jaws quick-
ly and hold them closed for a few seconds.

Bleeding

To stop external bleeding on the body
apply gauze pad. Cover with a piece of moist
cotton and wind layers of gauze bandage
around the body to hold pad in place. For
bleeding on the ear or head press ﬁrmly with
a wet wad of cloth or cotton.

For hemorrhage on the legs apply a
tourniquet using a rope, necktie or the dog’s
own leash. Apply above the wound if the
bleeding is from an artery (blood bright red
coming in spurts). Apply below the wound
if from a vein (dark red blood in a steady
ﬂow). Loosen the tourniquet every 15
minutes to re-establish circulation.

internal Hemorrhage

Internal bleeding can be caused by in-
jury, organic disease or infection. Symptoms
are fainting, pallor, weak pulse, rapid, shal-

 

Artiﬁcial respiration. Pump ani-
mal's legs forward and back.

low breathing, bleeding from nose, mouth,
rectum or genital organs. Keep the animal
quiet. If the animal is in shock note the
following paragraph.

Shock
Shock is caused by fright, loss of blood,

severe injury or exposure. Symptoms are
cold body, labored breathing, bluish-white
gums, semi-consciousness or unconsciousness.
The important thing is to keep the animal
warm. Give a stimulant if the animal is
conscious. Never give a sedative.

Artiﬁcial respiration should be given if
breathing has stopped. Turn animal on his
back and pull front legs forward and back-
ward in a rhythmical motion, applying pres-
sure inward against the chest wall with your
hands during the backstroke, until breathing
starts.

Heat Stroke and Heat Exhaustion

Excessive heat, direct hot sun, high hu-
midity and lack of air may result in heat
exhaustion and heat stroke, both highly
dangerous conditions. In the less serious
state, usually called heat exhaustion, the ani-
mal may be listless, semi-conscious or un-
conscious, the skin cold, the eyes blurred.
There may be muscular cramps. Keep the
animal in a cool room and if he’s conscious
give water containing a small amount of
table salt.

In the more dangerous condition, called
heat stroke, the animal is weak and pros-
trate. The skin becomes dry and hot. Fever

Heat stroke. Wrap dog in towel
and shower him with cold water.




 

 

 

IN THE NEWS PARADE

ANIMAL ANTICS

When an Atlantic City parakeet flew
out the window, the family placed his cage
in the yard in the hopes that Chris would
return. Five hours later Chris was found
romping merrily inside his home.

Another AWOL parakeet named
Chipper flew his coop and landed on the
shoulders of a boy across town. Said the
bird, “I’m Chipper Damico, 100 Kensington
Rd, Kensington, Conn.,” just as his owner
had taught him.

In Denver, a jet propulsion labora-
tory spokesman said the United States may
be able to get a man into space before it
can put a dog up in a satellite. He explained:
“With man we don’t have to worry about
the humane society.”

When asked how she went about get-
ting jobs in her occupation as a kitty-sitter,
a white haired Kansas City widow explained:
“Just the same way you would ask for any
other job. I go to the homes and get in-
spected by the cats. If they like me I get
the job.”

In a Georgia factory cookies and
crackers were usually dispensed on the honor
system beside soft drink machines. The sys-
tem seemed to be breaking down when
cookies disappeared and no nickels were
dropped in the jar. The culprit was caught
when a raccoon was spotted in the wash-
room dunking his cookies.

According to Britain’s National Union
of Seamen there are few ships today which
do not have a large number of birds aboard.
Some seamen actually breed canaries, tropi-
cal birds or budgerigars in their cabins.

10

The birds are replacing the cats that used
to be so necessary on ships before modern
fumigation methods ended the rat menace.

An Akron dog owner admitted in court
that his dogs run into his neighbor’s back-
yard. “But,” he explained, “It’s only because
my neighbor’s parakeet keeps Whistling to
them to come over.”

At the Coney Island Aquarium in
Brooklyn a maladjusted migratory seal was
given tranquilizers and force-fed vitamins
when he started a non-stop marathon swim
in his ISO-foot tank, shunning sleep and
even food. It was believed the seal was try-
ing to follow a natural impulse and migrate
to northern waters.

A mind-reading dog trained to give
arithmetical sums and other figures by tap-
ping the owner’s sleeve with his paw, was
reported to have given the correct score of.
a baseball game just played some distance
away. No one present knew at the time how
the game came out.

When a whooping loon blocked a
North Carolina highway, preventing cars
from passing, a bird specialist from the
county nature museum said the web-footed
fowl apparently mistook the glistening road
for water.

Police in Cranston, R. I., solved the
robbery of a bottling company because the
main clue was provided by footprints of a
dog. Detectives traced the dog’s footprints
to the home of its master and got a confes-
sion. The dog had accompanied the juveniles
who broke into the building.

 




T may surprise you to know that birds

rank second to dogs as the most popular
pets. Canaries, mynah birds, parrots and
love birds are ﬂooding millions of homes
with song and playful antics.

But the parakeet outnumbers them all,
perhaps because it’s beautiful, clean, easy
to care for, easily tamed and can be taught
to speak. With proper care a parakeet can
live 10 to 12 years.

     

In buying a parakeet choose a young
healthy bird. They’re easier to train. A
healthy bird sits erect, is plump, peppy and
has smooth feathers. Buy a bird ﬁve to six
weeks old if you intend teaching it to talk.
Only a solitary bird will learn to talk.

Some authorities believe that males make
the best talkers; others that both males and
females can be taught to talk and that fe-
males are more intelligent and playful.

Begin training by winning your bird’s
conﬁdence. When you ﬁrst get your pet
leave it alone for about a week until it be-
comes accustomed to its new home and your
voice. Talk to him as you clean the cage or

ﬁll the food cups.

The ﬁrst hurdle is reached when you get
him to perch on your ﬁnger. Gently put
your hand in the cage, rub its chest with

Teach
Your
Parakeet
To
Talk

your ﬁnger. Then lightly push the bird off
balance so it will be forced to grab your
ﬁnger for support.

In no time at all the bird will ﬂy about
the room and perch on your head or
shoulder. When you want to get it back
into the cage it should perch on your ﬁnger
when you extend it. Never grab for the
bird, let it come to you. If it insists on ﬂying
away, drop a cloth over it.

In teaching your parakeet to talk, choose
one simple word and repeat it slowly and
clearly over and over until the bird ﬁnally
says it. Go on to another word only after
it has mastered the ﬁrst. It may be several
months before it talks back, but the ﬁrst
word is the hardest. When it says “hello”
it will all be worth it. And when he repeats
whole sentences, the thrill you get will be
well worth the effort.

Army Horses Reprieved

In the future the Army will retire to
pasture horses declared unﬁt for duty. For-
merly, such horses were destroyed.

This reversal of Army policy is all due
to a horse named Tony, the Army’s oldest
working horse that was scheduled to be
destroyed after ﬁnishing 18 years of service
at Fort Myer, Virginia.

A newspaper article about Tony’s plight
elicited many letters to the ASPCA asking
us to intercede. In a letter to Secretary of
Defense Neil McElroy, General Manager
Warren W. McSpadden wrote: “The ASPCA
urges that this horse be pensioned by the
Army and put on a rest farm‘ to live out
his days, so well earned after 18 years in
the Army.”

As a result of the protests, the Army de-
clared that Tony would continue his present
assignment with the Ceremonial Detachment,
and that in the future horses declared unﬁt
for duty would be retired to pasture.

 




One of the ﬁrst operating experiences we
were called upon to handle involved 82 ani-
mals — ﬁve pigs, four bull calves, 16 heifers,
45 ewes and 12 rams. We had been open
only a few days when late one afternoon
several trucks arrived in front of the build-
ing, loaded with animals from all over the
Eastern United States, en route to Katmandu,
Nepal. Would we take them in for the night?

Now this posed a problem. Normally all
of these animals would have been placed in
our large animal room. Unfortunately, there
were already two horses under quarantine
in this room. Quick improvisation of a
smaller area usually assigned to birds and
monkeys made room for the sheep and the
rams. By erecting a home-made Walls of
Jericho the males and the females were sepa-
rated. Every available inch of space was
utilized to bed the other animals, while the
two quarantined horses occupied the largest
area in the building in a state of grandeur.

The 82 unexpected —— but indeed welcome
~ guests were to leave the next day at
1 p.m. Loading them into vans to carry them
to the planes took the entire morning. Load-
ing them onto a plane consumed three or
four additional hours until, at 4 o’clock, all
was set. The pilot was warming up the
plane, just about to take off, when a service
truck rammed the tail of the airliner, post-
poning the ﬂight for 24 hours.

By now the crew had ﬁnished cleaning up
the Animalport —— all ready to welcome back
for another night the 82 animals, which by
this time must have ﬁgured that getting in
and out of trucks and planes was some sort
of game.

Staten Island Adoption Center

A third piece of construction — not nearly
so big, but in its way just as interesting,
is the new glass-enclosed cat adoption center
at the Staten Island Shelter. It’s interesting
principally because of the enterprise and
imagination exercised by Walter L. Hollinde,
' District Manager of this small, but spic and
span shelter.

    

   

a

Adoption ward built by Staten Island Shelter
staﬁ with material donated by merchants.

Maybe Mr. Hollinde was a bit envious
when he watched the cat adoption ﬁgures
rising in the shelters which featured similar
display wards in Brooklyn, the Bronx and
Manhattan. Anyway, his reaction was to pro-
duce his own cat adoption ward with little
or no cost to the Society. Having made
friends with a number of merchants in the
community, he had their cooperation as he
went about soliciting glass, wood, concrete,
lighting and all the other needed materials
to build a cat adoption center for his Shelter.
Inspired by his leadership, members of the
staff joined in the actual construction. I
would like to commend Mr. Hollinde for his
imagination and ingenuity in this accom-
plishment.

Our Brooklyn Shelter is the largest in the
United States. It handled 71,901 animals
during the past year. But it’s not a new
building by any means, having been con-
structed in 1913. The time has arrived for
remodeling and refurbishing, and plans are
now being considered for major moderniza-
tion.

In Long Beach, where we have been op-
erating a little over a year, we are using
the building which served as that City’s
pound before we took over. While it is
serving our purposes temporarily, it in no

gan; Arnold Gervasio, of Trenton, New
Jersey; and Jeanette Mahoney, of Troy, New
York. In sixth place is Diane Brady, of
Butler, New Jersey.

Before we get too far away from the sub-
ject of horses I would like to review the
services performed in their behalf by our
Humane Work Department.

Every horse show held within a 65-mile
radius of New York City is covered by one
or more of the Society’s special agents. This
ﬁrst-hand observation has practically elim-
inated cruelty at these performances, and
we have had the whole-hearted support of
The American Horse Shows Association
whenever any violation has been reported.

Our special agents are also in attendance
at all performances of the rodeo and circuses

held in New York City.

We inspect stables where horses are kept
and watch the bridle paths for any signs
of over-riding or other offenses. Each of the
2,200 or so horses remaining in New York
knows the ASPCA officer as his friend. In
the summer there is a watering truck sta-
tioned across from the Plaza Hotel to service
the cab horses, which stand there in the
heat of the summer sun. We are often asked
why we don’t have this cab stand eliminated.

30

The answer is we would like to and have
tried on numerous occasions, but it is not
within our jurisdiction since the license to
maintain this stand is granted by the City
of New York.

Another type of inspection was added
with the passage of the Metcalf—Hatch Act
in 1952. That is the inspection of any lab-
oratory which has requisitioned animals
from us. The major portion of this work is
performed by William Ryan, who, as I have
said, has been with the Society over 40
years. His Visits are unannounced and un-

scheduled.

Laboratory Inspection

Nineteen hospitals and colleges requisi-
tioned 1,377 dogs and 243 cats last year.*

A modern roomy truck has been pur-
chased by the New York State Society for
Medical Research, through a grant from the
U. S. Health Department, for the trans-
portation of animals to the institutions requi-
sitioning them from us. The ASPCA sees
this as a desirable move and actually one
which we recommended. The use of «this new
truck, however, seems to have distressed
some people, who have the erroneous idea
that the truck is being used to transport

animals from the ASPCA Shelters to other

Cut away burned hair and apply petro-

is to concentrate the radiation upon the area being radiographed,
'T'ffr ' . _ with two very important beneﬁts:

 

 

~ ’ l. A clearer picture —-
A . The cone allows more concentrated rays to be focused on the
N aﬁected area, giving a clearer radiographic image.

2. Greater safety for patient and hospital personnel
By concentrating the rays, the cone protects them
from scatter radiation.

Won’t you please help us purchase the adiustable

addition to our Hospital's vital X-ray

equipment in aiding prompt diagnosis.

 

   

   




 

 

 

women a work

In the seven years since it was organized,
the ASPCA Women’s Volunteer Division
has become one of the Society’s best means
of publicizing our services. Besides netting
$13,553 in four fund-raising events during
the past year, the women are active agents
of good will for the Society in general and
for the Adoption Service program in par-
ticular. Their enthusiasm and support of
this project is one good reason animal adop-
tions have gone from 6,596 in 1952 to
17,998 in 1958.

In Nassau and Westchester Counties,
where ASPCA has just recently set up shelter
operations, local committees have helped us
gain acceptance and understanding in their

communities.

Judge Presents Medal to Dog

A German shepherd was recently awarded
the ASPCA Medal of Honor for capturing a
youth accused of breaking into a Bronx
store. The presentation was made by Magis-
trate Walter H. Gladwin.

Bobby was out for a walk on a Sunday
night with his owner Juan Banuche, owner
of a television repair shop. Passing the store,
Mr. Banuche heard glass crashing. Obeying
a command, Bobby leaped at the intruder
and held fast to a trouser leg until police
arrived. A .

In court Magistrate Gladwin praised
Bobby and voiced the hope that the dog

would receive a special commendation.

 

With a feeling of deep loss we report the
death on July 27 of William L. Burton. Mr.
Burton became a member of the Beard of
Managers in 1942, and was Secretary since
1947. He was also a member of the New
York Stock Exchange. He is survived by his
mother, Mrs. Charles D. Donahue, his
sister, Mrs. Howard Ross, and two children,
Beverly Burton and William L. Burton III.

way represents the high standards set by
the Society in the appearance and main-
tenance of its Shelters. I am, therefore,
pleased to announce that within the next
three or four months we will have moved
into a new home purchased by the City of
Long Beach and laid out by us.

When this latest reconstruction job is
completed, it will round out the program of
major plant improvement and expansion on
which we embarked some six years ago.
As long as we own a building or a piece
of equipment there will naturally be repairs
and maintenance, but there are no large
investments foreseen at the present time.
What I would like to see during my admin-
istration is a concentration on the services
our buildings are set up to perform for ani-
mals. This is our reason for being, and it is
by the good we do for animals and the
protection we give them that our status, and
therefore our future, is judged by the pub-
lic.

It’s a simple and easy exercise to pat
yourself on the back when you receive
laudatory mail, such as a recent example
from a woman who lost her dog:

“A few weeks ago, my dog —— an afghan
hound— was lost for one week and your
organization notiﬁed me that you had
found her. I went up to 92nd Street to
pick her up and found her (to my de-
light) happy, well fed, and beautifully
taken care of and in excellent condition.
I want to thank you from the bottom of
my heart.”

Another concerns an injured animal:

“I wish to thank you for your courtesy
and kindness in picking up the dog of
my son, and caring for him after he
was injured in an accident. The dog is re-
coverlng.”

Certainly we like to receive this sort of
approval. Who wouldn’t? But we never
settle back smugly and hope to live on our
laurels. Each day brings new challenges and
we must be ever alert and ready to measure
up with a fresh and intelligent response.

Volunteer Activities

Our sincere and active Women’s Volun-
teer Division is an excellent reminder in
keeping us on our toes. Volunteer activi-
ties often open up doors, giving us the op-
portunity to build good-will by correcting
misunderstandings and erasing bitterness be-
cause of mistakes. All organizations make
them no matter how hard they try not to.

Unfortunately complaints are not always
reported to those in charge. Instead, the
aggrieved tells neighbors and friends. They
repeat the story; each adding a bit of ex-
traneous information, until a chain of mis-
interpretation and misinformation is built
up which can be extremely damaging.

In their daily round of activities as well
as in their social lives, the women volun-
teers are often in a position to hear any
such adverse stories being circulated about
the ASPCA. They are as keen as Scotland
Yard in tracking down a critical tale to its
source. Thus the original complainant can
be dealt with directly.

This is excellent person to person public
relationswthe kind which usually cannot
be purchased.

The growth of the Women’s Volunteer
Division has been a slow but steady one,
which keeps it healthy. Some of the women

parts of New York State. There is not an
ounce of truth in this contention.

The new truck is being used instead of a
series of passenger cars and small trucks.
We consider it a great improvement from the
standpoint of the animal’s comfort.

Three Little Pigs

One would scarcely expect that in New
York City we would be called upon to rescue
farm animals. But we are. This is the story
of Three Little Pigs—not the ones who
went to market — but three fat porkers
which went on a rampage early in April
in the Sandy Ground Woods of Staten
Island.

In answer to frantic calls from frightened
residents and the police, ASPCA agents
working with police officers took up a vigil
in the thicket where the run-aways had
last been seen. A night-long look-out proved
fruitless, but in the morning hours the merry
trio was spotted again. But those pigs could
run——and did, until a strategic move was

made. Eight members of the police made a
corral encircling a given area of the wooded
section, giving ASPCA representatives James
O’Keefe and Amedeo Cali the chance to lasso
the delinquents.

The next step was to locate the owner,
who had not reported the loss of his prop-
erty. Finally he was tracked down. He had
sold his farm, including the three pigs.
Maybe they missed him and set out to ﬁnd
their former master. Maybe they just wanted
their liberty. Who knows? At any rate the
original owner redeemed them and we hOpe
they will live a long and useful existence.

Cruelty Investigation

Farm animals—in this instance 49 cows
——were involved in a case of an entirely
different nature—one of extreme cruelty,
in Highland, New York. The case was re-
ported by our special agent Ray Winne in
Ulster County.

George H. Tuscher, head of our Hu-
mane Work Department, went to investigate;
it was the second time he had investigated
the offender, the Ulsterdorp Farms. A year
or so earlier the caretaker had been arrested
on a complaint issued by the ASPCA be—
cause the cattle had been starved and were
in a state of ﬁlth and disease. Before the
case could be brought to trial, the Society
stationed men at the farm to clean up the
sordid situation at a cost of $600. This por-
tion of the gruesome story I told you last
year.

The caretaker was found guilty and sen-
tenced to 90 days in jail or a $500 ﬁne. On
appeal the verdict was set aside, however.

But the revolting mistreatment of the ani-
mals continued, and once again the ASPCA
took a strong hand in the matter, local
societies not having the staff nor the ﬁnan-
cial means of taking action. When Mr.
Tuscher arrived at the Highland farm he
was denied admission. Obtaining a search
warrant he had to threaten to break into
the buildings if he wasn’t admitted. What
he found were 49 cows, nine of which were

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
Heifers are led to plane bound for Nepal.

N 1938, during the Spanish Civil War a
young American church relief worker
doled out a drink made from dried milk and
water to long lines of orphans and mothers
with babies. For days in the hot sun he
watched the hungry drink the chalky mix-
ture, their only food for the day. And some-
times there was not enough to go around.

The relief worker soon realized the only
solution to the food problem was to bring
in cows that would give food for these
babies, fertilizer for the crops and a method
of building for the future.

Back in the States, his dream became a
reality when his farmer friends offered to
donate cattle. Others joined in, and in 1944
the ﬁrst load of heifers was shipped to
Puerto Rico.

This was the beginning of Heifer Project.
The idea caught ﬁre, with the nation’s
churches becoming major contributors. In
1953 the organization was incorporated with
headquarters in New Windsor, Maryland.

Since 1944 Heifer Project has shipped
10,112 cattle, 7,744 goats, 1,241 sheep, 1,524
pigs, 47 horses, 25 burros, 696 rabbits,
358,162 chicks, 310,657 hatching eggs and

HEIFER
PROJECT

numerous honey bees and turkeys to 51 war-
ruined and agriculturally undeveloped coun-
tries.

Three goats, for example, went to Korea
to supply milk for 80 children in an or-
phanage. A shipment of baby chicks to a
Greek village helped start a village poultry
industry. A resettled refugee farmer in
Western Germany received a cow and got
a new start in agriculture. A peasant farmer
in Egypt hatched some of the eggs from his
ﬂock of 1.5 chicks and traded them for a
piglet, which was fattened and traded for a
donkey. Eventually he sold the donkey and
bought a water buffalo, which served as
both horse and cow.

Heifer Project recipients are selected by
local church and government ofﬁcials and
Heifer Project representatives on the basis
of need and the ability to care for the ani-
mals. The recipient of an animal or a ﬂock
of chicks promises to give the ﬁrst born
offspring to someone else in need. In this
way he too helps build up the livestock of
his country, and a chain of giving is es-
tablished which makes the program self-
perpetuating.

Last March a typical shipment went to

 




 

Katmandu, Nepal, a landlocked little coun-
try between India and Tibet, Where there
were only a few sheep and cattle. A typical
shipment, that is, which ran into more than
typical trouble along the way.

Farmers from several states in the U. S.
offered 57 sheep, 20 calves and ﬁve pigs to
be picked up by trucks and driven to a col-
lection farm for testing and tagging. Orig-
inally scheduled for February, the shipment
was delayed twice, once because heavy
snows closed the trucking lanes, and again
by flight cancellation.

A month later, the go-ahead was given
and the cattle reached New York, there to
leave International Airport by plane for the
three and. a half day flight to New Delhi,

lndia.

Bad news at the Airport: the flight had
been postponed until the following day.
Luckily the ASPCA’S newly opened Animal-
port was prepared for just such emergencies
and took the wanderers in for the night.
The 82 animals were put up in every avail-
able nook and corner in the shelter.

Two Nights at the Animalport

Next morning several hours were con-
sumed in loading the livestock onto the
trucks and several more in unloading them
from the trucks and onto the plane. Just as
the plane was ready to take off in late after-
noon, a service truck rammed the tail of
the transport, postponing the ﬂight another
24 hours. More unloading and reloading and
back to the Animalport went most of the
82 animals for a second night. The re-
mainder got their 40 winks in the trucks in

which they had arrived.

Next day the plane took off with no fur-
ther hitches and three and a half days later
arrived in New Delhi. The last leg of the
trip was a six-day truck ride over the moun-
tains to Nepal.

The distribution of heifers is a festive
occasion. Ribbons are tied around the cows’
necks and an appropriate ceremony is held.
Each recipient draws a number out of a hat

to determine which heifer will be his. After
the ceremony the heifers are led to the
trucks or wagons to be taken home.

The success of Heifer Project can be
measured by such letters as this one from a
Japanese ofﬁcial. “Will you please accept
our sincere gratitude and appreciation for
your gift of goats. We received 2,200 goats
and now they increased to 10,000.”

One German recipient of a Heifer Project
gift said, “I wish Concordia (the cow)
could speak. She could tell me about the
people who sent her. It must take a lot of
love to give away a cow.”

Texas, served as ”ﬂying shepherd” for
Nepal ﬂight. He is minister of the United
Evangelical and Reformed Church there. His
denomination contributed most of the ani-
mals for the shipment.

Spaying

by fhe Veterinary Staff
ASPCA Hospital and Clinic

Spaying is an operation performed on a
female animal to prevent her from being
bred and bearing young.

Correctly deﬁned, spaying involves the re-
moval of the ovaries (female glands of re-
production). But in actual practice in most
veterinary hospitals the uterus (womb), as
well as the ovaries, is removed.

Advantages

Spaying has many desirable results. It
eliminates the female dog’s three weeks
“season” which occurs approximately every
six months, and during which she attracts
male dogs and must be conﬁned. lt elim-
inates the female cat’s “season” which oc-

curs about every four months.

Tumors involving the mammary glands
of spayed females are relatively rare, where-
as they are fairly common in unspayed
female dogs that have not had at least two
litters. Infections of the uterus which fre-
quently occur in older unspayed females

are avoided.

Spaying prevents pseudo-pregnancy due to
a hormonal upset, in which the mammary
glands ﬁll with milk, toys are “mothered”
and other maternal actions are manifested,
even though the female has not been bred.
And of course undesired mating and breed-
ing are entirely eliminated.

The Best Time

It is generally recommended that the sur-
gery be performed at about ﬁve or six
months of age, as this is ordinarily well be-
fore the initial seasonal period. But the
operation can be performed later if desired.
When done at the early age, the operation
is relatively simple. Healing takes about one
week, and in another week or two all normal
physical activities may be resumed.

Spaying Not Harmful

The surgical risk involved in spaying is
small. It is not harmful to the animal and
has no adverse effect on the pet’s alertness
or disposition. The spayed female makes an
ideal house pet. If spayed at ﬁve or six
months of age, correctly fed, and adequately
exercised, the spayed female should not be-
come overly fat. Obesity is generally due to
improper feeding, over-feeding, lack of ex-
ercise or a combination of these factors
rather than a direct result of spaying.

Spaying does have two disadvantages, but
for the house pet, they are far outweighed
by the advantages. The obvious disadvantage
is that a spayed female can no longer bear
young, and thus cannot be used for breed-
ing. A spayed female dog is ineligible for
the show ring, but with house pets this is a
very minor consideration.

Neutering Male Animals

In general, it is advisable to neuter male
cats not desired for breeding. The surgery,
which involves removal of the male repro-
ductive organs, is best performed at six to
seven months of age, but may be performed
later if necessary. Neutered male cats do
not roam away from home nor do they de-
velop the objectionable habit of spraying
rather odoriferous urine. For these reasons,
the neutered male cat is a far more desirable
house pet.

Neutering the male dog is not recom-
mended except in rare cases and then gen-
erally only for medical reasons.

 




 

 

 

Cats

and Sela/ice

by Dorothy K. Smith

With one important exception, the article
“Of Cats and Men” in the Spring issue of
ANIMAL PROTECTION was an engagingly in-
formative portrait of felis domestica, and
one which every cat lover must have
thoroughly enjoyed.

The one sentence which the editors have
graciously allowed me “equal and compar-
able time” to refute was this one:

“The cat is, ﬁrst of all, independent.
She serves no one, willingly or know-
ingly.”
Along with thousands of cat owners, I
beg to differ!

Consider, for example, Tidy—~pet cat of
Mrs. Amy Palmer, of Suffolk, England. Mrs.
Palmer is blind, but her alert cat lovingly
guides her mistress among furniture pieces
and along garden paths, enabling her to
lead a fuller, more active life. Or consider
Chickie, a cat who performs with her own
piano, crib, dining table, and “hot rod”—
all made for her by inmate friends—for
the amusement of the prisoners of San Quen-
tin prison. To them she brings companion-
ship and the priceless gift of laughter.

The roster of cats who have saved lives
is a long one. Two of the most recent are
Cindy, who saved three families by rousing
her owner, Miss Catherine Shackett, of
Springﬁeld, Masachusetts, when a ﬁre broke

12

 

out in the frame apartment house. Another
is Patches, who saved the two daughters of
the Paul Sermeus family, Waldwick, New

Jersey, from asphyxiation by escaping gas.

As secretary of the Puss ’n Boots Bronze
Award Committee, which is sponsored by
the Coast Fisheries Division of the Quaker
Oats Company, my ﬁles are bulging with
true stories of cats which have saved their
owners from ﬁre, asphyxiation, snakes, and
other tragedies. We have records of cats
who have served as seeing eyes—even one
cat who served as “voice” for a woman
stricken with a paralyzing heart attack,
“calling” her sister in time for lifesaving
capsules to be administered.

And then there is the therapeutic serv-
ice cats render to us humans. The comfort-
ing of very old people through warm com-
panionship, the sense of security they render,
is a very real thing. And in the area of
juvenile delinquency cat ownership has often
proved a wholesome interest-substitute for
switch knives and corner-lot “rumbles.”

With this growing evidence of cats’ serv-
ices to our bodies—and minds—who would
wish to limit them to Webster’s rather nar-
row deﬁnition of pets as “a domesticated
animal kept to fondle and play with”?

Obviously, Daniel Webster never owned
a cat!




A Humane Slaughter law

The 85th Congress, during its second ses-
sion, passed the ﬁrst humane slaughter law
in the country’s history. This Victory will be
referred to in humane society annals as one
of the most signiﬁcant gains in our crusade
against man’s inhumanity toward animals.

The law was passed by the House on Feb”-
ruary 4, and, after ﬁve months of struggle,
by the Senate on July 29.

In the Senate the measure was ﬁrst turned
over to the Committee on Agriculture. An
ASPCA representative testiﬁed at public
hearings, along with witnesses from other
humane, church and women’s groups, in fa-
vor of HR 8308 without amendment.

But when the bill came out of Commit-
tee it had been distorted into a watered-
down version, merely calling for a two-year
study of humane methods already available,
and in use by 18 leading packers.*

We reported all this to you in June in
an ASPCA “Write Off Cruelty” leaﬂet. We
asked CAN THEY GET AWAY WITH IT?

You and thousands of other voters were
determined to prevent such crippled legis-
lation. Your letters ﬂooded Washington.
Senator Allen J . Ellender, of Louisiana,
Chairman of the Agriculture Committee,
who voted against HR 8308 in its ﬁnal form,
stated on the Senate ﬂoor, “I have been in
the Senate for 22 years, and I know of no
bill which has provoked more letter writing
and telegraphic communications. . . .”

As a result of your letters, the Senate, by
a vote of 72 to 9, reversed its own commit-
tee, a rare occurrence, and passed HR 8308
in its original form. The President signed it
into law on August 27.

son 81 Company. We enclose for your convenience
when shopping a list of these packers. As others
convert, we will keep you informed.

Is Our Job Finished?
HR 8308 can be considered only a signiﬁ-

cant beginning, however. In a nutshell these
are its main points.

0 The law, which goes into effect June
30, 1960, applies only to packers selling
meat to the U. S. government, the nation’s
largest single purchaser ($250,000,000 an-
nually). While such packers number only
between 300 and 500 out of about 3,400,
they slaughter most of all food animals.

0 The law does not apply to poultry.

0 The law contains no criminal penalties.

No, the job isn’t ﬁnished. But we feel once
packers selling to the government install hu-
mane methods, others will too. If they do
not, legislation within the various states will
be sought— and won!

We’d like to thank Congressman W. R.
Poage, of Texas, for drafting HR 8308,
Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, of Minnesota,
who led the three-year ﬁght for humane
slaughter, and all the House and Senate
members who supported this legislation.

 

 

BETTER THAN
A BONE!

A bone is good but it
doesn’t compare with
complete dog foods like
Big Red Meal and Big Red
Pellets.

Why? A bone is high in
protein and minerals, low

in energy ingredients.

Big Red is right in every-
thing a dog needs.

have been with us since the group was ﬁrst
organized under the direction of Mrs. George
Hayman a little over seven years ago. Under
her leadership a Long Island Committee was
formed during the past year. The Long
Island Committee’s ﬁrst fund-raising event
last May was a major success. Having
pledged themselves to raise $2,300 for the
purchase of an ambulance for the Glen Cove
Shelter, they handed in a check for $3,770.
They have just held a second Carnival for
Animals Dinner Dance—but I’ll save the
reason and result of that for next year’s
summary.

The Ark, a once-a-year shop for the sale
of china, linens, bric-a-brac, silver and the
like, brought in $2,000 from a pre-Christmas
sale in December. This is an event in which
all of us can participate, either by contrib-
uting items we no longer use, or by making
the Ark the spot at which to do our Christ-
mas shopping.

The Animal Kingdom Ball in January
netted $6,990 and the Easter Adopt-a-Pet
Parade $793, bringing the funds raised by
our women volunteers for the last ﬁscal year
to $13,553. Then to see and be seen there
are two booths, one at the National Horse
Show, the other at the Westminster Kennel
Club Show.

Adoption Service

I can’t repeat too frequently that the
Adoption Service program is one of our
principal and most satisfying activities. Find-
ing homes for homeless animals gives a
warm sense of accomplishment. At the same
time it is a source of strong appeal to the
general public. This is evident in the very
number of animals we placed last year—«
the highest in our history and I dare say
the record for any humane society in the
country— 17,998. Five years ago the ﬁgure
was 8,077 cats, dogs and other animals.

What a climb!

Newspaper publicity, word of mouth rec-
ommendation, the new cat adoption wards,
the stimulus of the women volunteers, who

ANIMALS ADOPTED

 

 

DOGS CATS
have chosen the adoption program as their
principal project — each has contributed to
this fantastic growth. But greater than any
one of these is the desire on the part of
every member of the Society’s staff to see
that the animals they handle get a break.
Our employees are constantly on the alert
when it comes to ﬁnding homes for the dogs,
cats and often other pets that have been
left with us for this purpose.

However, there are still thousands of peo-
ple who apparently have never heard that
pets are available at our shelters at no
charge, except a $3 license fee if it is a
dog to be kept in New York City. So, I
urge you whenever the opportunity presents
itself, as l have found it frequently does, to
tell your friends, neighbors, the grocer, the
laundryman or anyone who is interested, to
come to us if they are looking for a pet.

ASPCA Employees
For the majority of ASPCA’s employees,

their work is more than a daily job—in
many cases it is a dedicated career. Of the
200-odd members of the Society’s staff, two
have been with us 40 years or more ——
William Ryan and Thomas J. Flynn; 20 have
been with us for 25 years or more, and 71
— or one-third of our staff —— for 10 or more

so weakened from lack of food they couldn’t
stand up —— and the 40 others just skin and
bones, many weighing less than 300 pounds
each. A pitiful sight, I am told.

Again the caretaker was arrested. Having
been examined by a psychiatrist the old
lady, aged 74, was sent to a mental institu-
tion and the owner was forced to make suit-
able arrangements for the care of the ani-
mals, getting them into condition to sell.

Subsequent investigation on our part
shows the cattle are being satisfactorily
cared for.

Animal Hospital

There is no service more vital to the So-
ciety’s wide program of animal welfare than
the Hospital. It is here that animal life
itself is preserved and that the sick and
injured are tended and often given a chance
for a future.

The head of such a Hospital, where 37,685
animals were treated last year, is a key
ﬁgure in the roster of ASPCA personnel.
When Dr. Raymond J. Garbutt became
Consulting Veterinarian, after serving the
Society for 37 years, 30 of them as Chief
Veterinarian, we were fortunate indeed to
have on the Hospital staff a young, vigorous
and well-qualiﬁed veterinarian to take his
place. It was with a high degree of conﬁ-
dence and trust that Dr. John E. Whitehead
was appointed Chief of Staff of the Hospital
last June. A graduate of the School of Vet-

erinary Medicine, University of Pennsyl-

32

vania, Dr. Whitehead interned at the Angell
Memorial Hospital in Boston. He has written
a number of papers on veterinary problems
for professional magazines, and has con-
ducted several studies in clinical research.
Since we see pathology as a basis for the
development of our Hospital, which now in-
cludes a system for recording autopsy and
other pathology reports, as well as a clinical-
pathology laboratory, we consider Dr. White-
head a very real asset.

Already, under his guidance, the Hospital
has embarked on a research program with
the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer
Research. Specimens of neoplasms from ani-
mals suspected of having tumorous growths
are prepared and sent to Sloan-Kettering for
diagnosis. When certain types of cancer are
diagnosed, with the owner’s permission, we
will give a course of treatment using the
latest anti-cancer drugs suggested by Sloan-
Kettering at no cost to the owner.

A more typical hospital case, however,
would be the one of the blind couple whose
Seeing Eye dog was beginning to lose its
sight—a great tragedy under any circum-
stances, but almost unbearable to contem-
plate in the case of a guide dog. In this
instance the dog was operated upon, his

Keeping a tropical ﬁsh aquarium is an
exciting hobby and less work than many
people think. It’s ideal for small apartment
dwellers and people with limited time to
devote to a pet.

Ten minutes a week and a few cents for
food will reward you with a variety of en-
tertainment in color. Watching the beautiful
display of colorful ﬁsh gliding amid under-
water plants will give you a feeling of own-
ing your own corner of the world’s oceans.

Equipping the Aquarium

With tropical ﬁsh, the initial investment
is everything. In setting up your aquarium
you will need a tank (24 x 12 x 12 is a
good manageable size), a stand (unless it
is to be placed on a table or bookcase), a
bulb and a light reﬂector, two pounds of
gravel for every gallon of water, 20 or 30
assorted plants, a heating unit and a ther-
mometer. An aerator and ﬁlter are desirable,
although not essential.

Get a well-sealed, stainless-steel rectangu-
lar tank. Narrow topped bowls are not good.
First wash the tank inside and out. Never
use soap. Dry it and check for leaks. Stand
it in its permanent position. Next wash the
gravel thoroughly and place in the bottom
of the tank so it slopes from front to back.

Bury the heater under the gravel and
take its wire up a corner of the tank and
down the back of the stand. Tropical ﬁsh
need warmth, healthiest temperature being
around 75 degrees. A heater with a thermo-
stat will simplify temperature control.

8

Aquarium Stock Co.

Half ﬁll the tank with water. Pour the
water over a folded newspaper to prevent
disturbing the gravel. Let the water stand
in a large container for 72 hours before
ﬁlling the tank to eliminate any chlorine.

Plants

Plants are an essential part of the aquar-
ium. They make for a “balanced” tank, sup-
plying the ﬁsh with oxygen given off by the
plants and absorbing the carbon dioxide
given off by the ﬁsh. Without plants ﬁsh
would soon suffocate from lack of oxygen.

The important point is :to plant your tank
generously with good oxygenating plants and
not overcrowd it with ﬁsh. A good rule of
thumb is that one inch of ﬁsh (excluding
tail) requires up to 25 square inches of
surface area of water. An aerator and ﬁlter
will double the number of ﬁsh allowed.

Wash and soak the plants thoroughly in
slightly salted cold water. Then insert them
in the gravel in a pleasing arrangement,
shortest plants to the front, tall ones in the
back. Anchor them ﬁrmly.

Fill the tank with clean “aged” water,
again over a newspaper. Place the reﬂector
in position and plug it in. Plug in the
heater and allow the tank to stand a couple
of days to be sure the heater and thermo-
stat are working.

Varieties of Fish

Now buy the ﬁsh. Start your community
tank with assorted pairs of ﬁsh of the hardier
species. Aim for color, grace and movement

Teddy’s Dogs

Probably no occupant of the White House
was a more avid lover of dogs than 26th
P‘resident— Theodore Roosevelt.

Always busy—as a soldier, a rancher, a
big game hunter and as President—he
found plenty of time to devote to pets. Visi-
tors to the Roosevelt’s Sagamore Hill home
in Oyster Bay, Long Island, would often
encounter Teddy’s six children racing across
the lawns with one of several dogs.

Among the dogs in his menage were a
rat terrier, a bull terrier, several of non-
descript breed and a big friendly St. Bernard
named Rollo. On one hunting trip out west
he picked up a little terrier, which he named
Skip, and brought back east. It didn’t take
Skip long to win his master’s heart com-
pletely, and for many years when Roosevelt

18

was lost in the whirl of White House busi-
ness, he found his greatest relaxation in the
moments he spent alone with Skip.

One day, when the President was in
Oyster Bay, Skip wandered off the Sagamore
Hill property and was killed by a car. The
death of Skip was a tragedy in the Roose-
velt household. Two of the President’s chil-
dren built a small cofﬁn for the dog. At
3 pm. the next day Skip was buried.
Promptly on the hour, the President and
Mrs. Roosevelt turned out for the funeral.
The procession gathered in front of the
porch and the children sadly led the way
down the hill toward the dog cemetery back
of the house.

This year, the 100th Anniversary of
Roosevelt’s birth, Visitors to the Sagamore
Hill estate can still see the stones erected to
mark the graves of the Roosevelt pet dogs.

President William Rockefeller (center) con-
gratulates James T. Dibble and Patrick J.
Sutton, staff members for 25 years.

years. This is a spendid record and one
which speaks well for the type of individual
on our payroll and management as well.

Perhaps the expressions used in several
of the hundreds of letters of praise received
during the past year regarding the attitude
of our staff will give a more vivid picture.
Regarding one of our veterinarians: “He
was most pleasant, informative and kind.”
Referring to an agent picking up an in-
jured dachshund: “His quiet and efﬁcient
manner gave great conﬁdence.” A third
correspondent uses the phrase “courtesy
plus speed” in handling a pick-up case.

These qualities are something which
money alone cannot buy.

Humane Slaughter Legislation

I had hoped to be able to report tonight
that the bill providing for Humane Slaughter
had passed the Senate of the United States
as it did the House of Representatives in
February last.

Hearings were held during early May
before the Senate Committee on Agriculture
and Forestry. Many large humane societies
sent representatives. The ASPCA sent its
Director of Public Relations, Mrs. George
Fielding Eliot, to make a statement on be-
half of the passage of S 1497, the Bill under
discussion. Mrs. Eliot’s evaluation of the
situation upon her return from Washington

28

was not an optimistic one. It was her be-
lief that either the measure would not be
reported out of Committee, or that a study
bill would be substituted for the compulsory
bill we are supporting. To date there has
been no encouraging sign to contradict her
reaction.""

The Department of Agriculture, the Amer-
ican Meat Institute and certain senators and
representatives asked for further time for
study before legislation is passed. This is
an old tune, played for the ﬁrst time 29
years ago, before there were any perfected
instruments for the humane slaughter of food
animals. Now there are a number of such
instruments on the market, among them The
Remington Stunner, the Schermer Stunner,
the Carbon-Dioxide Immobilizer and the
electric knife.

A number of packing houses, large and
small have converted in whole or in part
to one or the other of these approved hu-
mane methods of slaughter. These leaders
are to be commended. Their products
should be given preference by those of
us who are ﬁghting to get compulsory hu-
mane slaughter legislation passed. But there
are 3,200 other packers in the country.
And as long as humane slaughter remains
a subject for study and there is no force
to compel these packers to use humane
methods, so long will the cruelties now ex-
tant in packing houses exist. And, so long
will the ASPCA continue to wage its war
for compulsory humane slaughter legislation.

During the past year three leaﬂets setting
forth the status of the legislation and giving
directions as to whom to write were pre-
pared and sent to our membership. Many
people requested this literature in bulk, and
many others — not members or contributors
asked to have their names added to our mail-
ing list for information on the subject.
Since the weight of numbers is so important
in getting legislation passed, we welcome
these requests. But extra mailings through-

* See page 17 for latest developments on humane
slaughter legislation.

 




 

sight restored, and he was ready within a
couple of weeks to return home with his
master to greet his mistress and a new play-
mate —— a baby girl born during his absence.

This kind of story is repeated a thousand
times over during a year’s time at our Hos-
pital and Clinic Where “no animal in need of
care is ever turned away.”

Lost Dogs

During the year the ASPCA helped re-
unite 4,749 lost dogs with their owners.
Most of these happy reunions took place
because the lost dog wore its license tag and
it was a simple matter for us to look up
the name of the owner in our ﬁles.

One lost dog, however, presented a bit
more of a problem. He was found on a
street in Buenos Aires, Argentina—6,000
miles from New York. A native of Cordoba
City, Argentina, he had traveled to New
York with his owner several months before.
He stayed here long enough to get a dog
license, become so ill he nearly died, recover
through careful treatment, travel back to
South America, only to get lost three days
after his return.

When he was found in Buenos Aires he
was still wearing his ASPCA license tag.
The ﬁnder wrote us. Immediately we wired
back the name and former New York ad-
dress of the owner, who had been living in
Forest Hills, Queens. With this information
the ﬁnder was able to track down the owner
in Cordoba City— all thanks to an ASPCA

license tag.

Another lost dog story concerns a Welsh
Corgi which turned up wearing a tag in-
scribed “Tailwaggers Club, Lochvinnoch.”
He had crossed the Atlantic by plane from
Glasgow, Scotland, and was scheduled for a
short stop-over in New York before going
on to Canada by rail. But the dog had other
ideas. He chewed his way out of his crate
and spent two days sight-seeing around
New York before he was found on a street
in Long Island City and brought to our
Jamaica Shelter. There he was identiﬁed

from a missing dog bulletin as an escaped
fugitive from the Railway Express train
yard in Sunnyside. A quick call to Railway
Express and the wandering Scotsman was
back in his crate on his way to his destina-
tion in Canada.

That’s why we continue to say a license
is the best and cheapest insurance you can
purchase for the return of your pet if. he
is lost or strays away from home.

The two cases just cited have an interna-
tional ﬂavor—not unusual. For, while the
ASPCA has a charter in New York State
only, and conﬁnes its activities to New York
City and environs, its reputation as a leader
in the humane ﬁeld is known throughout
the world.

From Brazil comes the question: “Will
you give us advice on legislation concerning
the sale of chicks and ducklings as play-
things?”

From Spain: “Please advise the best way
to put an animal to sleep.”

Then there was the letter from Turkey:
“I hear that you have brochures about pet
birds. If you can send me one about night-
ingales and parakeets I shall be glad very
much.”

The latter was in English—but most of
this foreign mail has to be translated before
it can be answered, an indication of how
diversiﬁed and .how detailed the work of the
Society has become.

Education Program

The letter from Turkey about the birds
was answered by our Director of Education,
Diana Henley.

Miss Henley has only recently been ap-
pointed Director of Education, although she
has been an instructor in our education
department for almost four years.

writing, as editor of her college magazine,
