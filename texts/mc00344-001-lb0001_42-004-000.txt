Battle for the Environment

Americans who believe in protection of the
environment and this country’s dwindling
natural resources often have felt they are
fighting a losing battle with the current admin-
istration in the White House and the destruc-
tive tactics of Interior Secretary James G.
Watt. But something wonderful 1s happening 1n
the battle with the administration over contin-
uation of the Endangered Species Act, which is
the centerpiece of environmental protection
laws: it appears that the preservationists are
winning.

Separate bills to extend the act for another
three years are awaiting action in the House
and the Senate, and the prognosis is good. Mr.
Watt had sought a one~year reauthorization of
the law, with the apparent goal of wanting to
wait out an election year and then return to
Congress next year with amendments to gut
the 1973 law. But the plan to save the act for at
least another three years apparently is what
will be approved when the bills reach the sepa-
rate floors for debate. ,,

Some pr0p05ed changes would modify the
present procedure for obtaining an exemption
from protective sections, but all of them can be -
lived with. One excellent change would require
administration officials to make a decision
within one year after a proposal to add a spe- >
cies to the endangered list. That is aimed
directly at the administration, which has
dragged its feet in adding new species to the
list, to the annoyance of environmentalists. ‘

A large outpouring of public suppert of this
law to prevent the extinction of plant and wild-
life may be what gave Mr. Watt and other op-
ponents of an extension cold feet. One influen-
tial senator was heard to remark that he had
received more mail on endangered species
than on nuclear, arms limitations, another
politically-sensitive tepic. It is doubtful that
any congressman would want a vote to weaken
such a popular concept on his record in N ovem-

' her. If this extension becomes law, it undoubt-

edly will be due to the American public’ 3 insis-
tence that a diverse world 1s the best world.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thank you for sending me the second copy of Jeff
Diner's report. My son had asked for it -- he 18

taking his senior year at New York University and
became interested in the subject of laboratory
animal experimentation not only through me but
through a course he took in philosophy of medi—
cine. The class discussed animal experiments at
length. My son Steve was the only one in the
class who was not a pre-medical student, and he
took on the whole class, on this subject. Some
of the attitudes of those incipient physicians
were scary.

I guess you have heard that Readers' Digest
plans to reprint a shortened version of my
article on animal experimentation that appeared
in the New York Times Magazine. It is apparently
the Digest's policy to double—check for accuracy
every statement in articles they reprint. I
referred Kathryn Powell, the woman who's working
on my article, to you and Jeff. I'm glad to
hear that she is going to talk to you after she
sees Thurman Grafton.

I also suggested that the Digest ask permission
of Animal Welfare Institute and Dr. Peacock to
reprint part of his Preface to appear with my
article, but Ms. Graham says she doubts if there
will be enough space. Too bad.

Well, it's good that 40 million Digest readers
will read about the plight of laboratory animals,
isn't it. Thanks for seeing the Digest person.
She sounds sympathetic.

Sincerely,

gaming

Dear Mr. Lancaster,

Ybur article on the perils of squirrel
hunting led us to hope that you might
want to lwnd your great talents to help
trap victims.

I'm enclhsing some information on the leg
hold trap which causes atrocious pain and
fear, not only to the target species, but

to other wild and domestic animals and birds
when they are accidentally caught.

Perhaps some day you'll want to write on this

subject. Humor like yours is a.marvelous
weapon against the unthinking and unfeeling.

Sincerely,

Dear,Robl

Thanks for sending the pieces intended for unior high
school. I amreturning all of the pieces I am ab e to locate
because I can't be sure which one number two was.

Here are just a few'notes: in reading "The Death of Our
Tuna Fisherman's Innocence," I noted that you said the boats
cost up to four million dollars. This is DOW’up to five million.
Also, the.nets, we are told, cost $200,000.

As I mentioned, I think the total of dolphins killed in
the last 15 years is much greater than one million. One year in
the early 70 3 had a total of over 300,000 deaths. You'll want
to check the figures carefully before going into print with them.

When you see the neW'EDF film, I knOW'you’ll agree that it
mportent to get into all articles on this sub‘ect not just
the death but the suffering and fear of the dolph ns before they
e.

Concerning the "Is the Japanese Egye on the Dolphin?" the
recent television report on the netting of dolphins gives some
basic information, though it's not applicable to fishing on the
high seas, I feel doubtful about that piece, as I told you, be-
cause the criticism is directed at Japan as a whole, and we ought
not to criticize Japanese who are trying to save whales and
dolphins, but encourage them.to act strongly. The Japanese press
has played an important part in making such progresnsas has so
far been made for the whales. I hope they will help the dolphins,
too 0

If you still have time for one last piece, it would be
very hel ful for us to have a short piece for young school
children in the elementary grades who write to us asking how'they
can help save the whales. we do not feel the boycott is suitable
for small children, but it in quite appropriate for them to

 




address letters to the ambassadors of the whaling nﬁticns. If
you could write a very simple pieCe, it wnuld be very useful for
us to distribute to teachers 0r pupils in grades two, three and

fnur.

Best wishes for the New Year.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens

Dear Christine,

Here are my last two pieces. I tried to write them for
junior high school age children.

The address you.shonld send the letter of recommendation
to is: Gallaudet College, Kendall Green, Washington, D. C.
20002. In the future I will try and discourage prospective
employers from bothering you.

You mentioned giving me extra money to cover postage
eXpenses, etc. There will be no need for that since I will
have plenty of money with the last check you will send.

As I originally saw it the income from my works that were
to'beplaoed.in magazines was to go to the Animal Welfare
Institute. As far as I am concerned you.own them. So if you
would like, I will send the checks I receive on to you. If you
would instead prefer that I keep the income from.the stories
so I can keep writing I will do that.

Looking over the work I've sent you I still feel the

only pieces that I cannot rework to fit magazines are the
2nd, 3rd, and 9th pieces. However, if you'd like to keep
any of the others please do.

I will probably write a couple more letters identifying
myself as associated with AWI. I will send you carbon COpies

of these letters along with whatever information I uncover.
If you have any special assignments don't hesitate to ask.

Rob Park Your friend,

Gentlemen:

Our company newsletter, of which I am editor, runs a monthly
Environment article. Several months ago, I did a story on
the plight of whales. I was moved to do the article after
reading a pamphlet distributed by your organization.

Since running the story, I have seen several articles in
newspapers and magazines, alerting the public to the inhumane
treatment of some animals and of the near extinction of others.
As an animal lover, these articles and the photos that appear
with them are extremely distressing, to say the least. Yet,
as editor of our company paper, I feel I am in a position to
alert our 2000 employees to theriight of these animals. Hope-
fully, periodic articles of this nature will incite them into
action-~whether through a monetary contribution or by writing
letters of protest to those in a position to correct this
abominable man—made situation.

I would, therefore, appreciate any and all material you may
have at your disposal from which I could derive potential
articles for our paper. In addition, if you have a mailin
list of any kind, I would appreciate having my name added 3
to it. ¢MwwwmmWWMWMWmmmMm NWMWW.W_. amp ..M_-

 

 

 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely yours,

beaver

Once near doom in New York, this
creature of admirable character and
orange teeth is now nominated as
the official state mammal

 

 

   

 

 

By Hope-Ryder:

In Albany a bill has been introduced in the
Legislature which would name the beaver New
York’s official state mammal An authority on the
beaver like Dr. Lars Wilsson, the Swedish biologist, ..
,_,, agawdoubtlessly would feel this does small credit to ._
~ beavers In faCt, to anyone who contends that

beavers are like people, Dr. Wilsson is apt to reply/ '

that such a statement flatters mankind. For, though
some of us have acquired traits that have proved to
have high survival value for beavers, allspeavers
are notable for cleanliness, diligence, community
spirit, cohesive family life, adaptability, ingenuity
and thrift
Nevertheless, there are plenty of arguments ‘
favoring the beaver as state mammal. It has always
played an important ecological role in the natural
world and, so far as New York’s history is con
. cerned, there could scarcely be a more appropriate
symbol. Though not everyone takes pride in our
‘ancestors’ wholesale/slaughter of fur-bearing ani~
' mals, nonetheless, no one would deny that the
beaver, or his pelt, provided incentive for the
exploration and. settlement of the wilderness that
is now the Empire State. Most accounts of that
romantic period gloss over the fact that the beaver
was. virtually wiped out in the process. Indeed, had
it not been for the efforts of- a few nature lovers
at the beginning of this century, today there would
be no beavers at all in New York State.

In the early 17th century, the Dutch were no less
single-minded in their quest for riches in the New

‘ World than were the Spaniards, who were already
plundering Mexico and South America. The Dutch,
settling in the Hudson Valley, concentrated their-

. activity on the waterways, where they discovered
beaver in vast numbers. Beaver products, both fur
and castoreum (a glandular secretion valued at that
time as a medicine for everything from‘frostbite to
hysteria), were much in demand in Europe, where,
no well-dressed gentleman (Continued on Page 40)

was properly outfitted with-
out a beaver hat. To satisfy
this craze, beavers had been
hunted nearly to extinction
on the European continent.
Soon Fort Orange on the
Hudson River (today’s Alba-
ny) became a leading port for
shipping furs, and was sub-
sequently rechristened Bever-
wyk.

To the north, the Montreal-
based French, also seized with
beaver fever, began sending
their bateaux and canoes
southward into the streams
and lakes of the Adirondacks.
Thus began a bitter struggle
for control of the region.
Many Indian tribes, which,
prior to the arrival of the
white man, had regarded the
beaver as sacred, were lured
into the hunt. By 1660, trap-
pers had so overrun the area
that beavers had been exter-
minated in the Beverwyk
area. The fur hunters then

moved inland, leaving in their

wake a trail of beaver ghost
towns. To destroy an entire
colony was relatively easy,
for the gregarious beavers
lived together in mud—walled
lodges. From earliest times,
these sturdy fortresses, built
in the middle of .ponds, had
protected the animals from
their natural enemies. With
man’s arrival, however, the
conspicuous lodges were an
invitation to annihilation.

In the year 1700, so many
beaver pelts were brought to
the port of Montreal that 75
per cent of them had to be
burned in order to maintain
the market price. By the
eighteen-hundreds, only a few
thousand beaver remained in
New York State, and John
Jacob Astor sent an expedi—
tion to the distant Oregon
Territory to begin the Pacific
Coast harvest. The invention
of the steel trap doomed What
remained of New York’s bea—
vers.~By 1840, only 300 of
them were counted through-
out the state, and the survey
party reported that these no
longer lived in lodges and
built dams but had taken to

__ underground burrows.

he beaver was not

always the wary,

nocturnal creature

we know today. Be-
fore the arrival of the Euro-
peans, it worked on its dams
and lodges in broad daylight
and sunned itself in the open.
Most Indian tribes treated it
with superstitious respect, and
rarely killed it. Several tribes
believed that beavers were
their reincarnated ancestors;
others considered them a fal-
len race of men, forced to

atone for misdeeds by a life-
of hard labor.

The Ojibways regarded bea-
vers as “little Indians.” Even
after they were drawn into the
fur trade by the Europeans,
the Ojibway trappers would,
on occasion, take. pity on an
orphaned beaver kitten that
swam after a canoe bearing
away the bedy of its mother.
The baby would be plucked
from the water and taken to
some bereaved Indian woman
who Would suckle it. In the
book “Pilgrims of the Wild,”
Grey Owl, an adopted member
of the Oji'bway tribe, recalled
these orphaned animals as
“small, willing captives, with
their almost child—like intima—
cies and murmurings of affec-
tion, their rollicking good fel-
lowship with not only each
other but ourselves. . . .They
seemed to be almost like lit-
tle folk from some other
planet, whose language we
could not 7 yet quite under—
stand.”

Even were it not for its
winning ways, it is likely that
the beaver still would have
won the Indians’ esteem. No
other species is so like man
in its ability to alter the en-

vironment to suit its own

needs. In fact, by comparison,
man’s attempt to reshape the
earth to his liking is a recent
phenomenon, and the Chero-

“ kee legend that attributes the

creation of the earth to the

beaver is brilliant allegory.

To understand the influ-
ences that have produced
many features of our present-
day landscape, we must bear
in mind that, over long ages,
countless generations of bea-
vers inhabited North America.
Before the opening of the New
World, an estimated 60 mil~
lion members of the species,
Castor canadensis, were dis-
tributed along every mile or
so of stream across the con
tinent. Through their ‘labor,
pools were formed, spring wa~
ter conserved, water tables
maintained and flooding reg—
ulated. As a by-product of
their habitat management,
many other animals, as well
as birds, fish and even plants,
were benefited.

Beavers were equally im—
portant to the conservation
of soil. Sediment headed for
the sea was trapped and de-,
posited in their quiet pools.
In, time, a beaver pond might
become so clogged with silt
that its inhabitants would be
forced to relocate. When this
occurred, their abandoned
homesite might slowly change
into a luxuriant meadow and,
thenceforth, serve quite dif-
ferent forms of life. And as
a result of their harvesting of
deciduous trees, beavers aided.
in forest renewal. Their pre-

Although the beaver is an

adapted to an amphibious life.

Its oversized liver and large
lungs enable it to hold its
breath for as long as 15 min-
utes. Its ears and-nose are
valvular and can be shut off
at 'will. A transparent mem-

brane protects its eyes when

it dives. Its mouth is con—
structed so that fur flaps close
behind its front incisors, al-
lowing it to chew wood una

1: the \animals swim about.

‘ After the relatively long
gestation period of 105 days
(canines reproduce young in
62 days), beaver kittens are

I’born fully furred and ‘with
“their eyes open. Though they

are. capable of swimming "at
the age of 4 days, they are
indulged and guarded by ev-

1' ery member of the colony
- iand, normally, do not leave

the lodge until they are 2
months 01d. Until then, the
playful babies confine their
water sports to the mouth

. of a plunge hole where the'
‘mother can hold them afloat

by the tail should they get

‘. into difficulty.

On land, a mother beaver

will carry her baby in the:

same way she transports
branches—supported on her
forepaws and secured, by her

resting chin. While a kit is

very young, it prefers to feed
from the same branch as its
mother and demands a good
deal of petting from her. It
also requires frequent groom-
ing and regular applications
of oil.

Beavers must keep their fur

‘ fastidiously groomed and oiled

in order to maintain a water-

proof coat; henCe they are
, endOwed with special equip-
" ment for this purpose. Their
,hind feet, which are webbed,
' have five toes, the second of
‘ which has a split nail. With

this they meticulously comb
their forearms—as well as
eVery other reachable part of
their bodies—until every hair
is in place and no patch of
skin is left uncovered. Then,
with their handlike forepaws,
they reach into their cloaca,

.an opening containing, be~

sides the reproductive and
excretory organs, glands from
which they obtain castoreum,

the rich oil they spread .on

their fur. ‘ Hard-to—reach places
are tended by another beaver.
(Mutual grooming is an im—
portant means of maintaining
social" bonds in a beaver
colony.)

t is due only to the

strenuous efforts of a few ,

early conservationists
that New York State
has a beaver population to-
day. Ln 1890, the last-known

colony of indigenous animals

-perhaps no more than 10
individuals—existed on St.
Regis Pond near Saranac
Lake, where they received
unofficial protection from the

' management of the Saranac

Inn. Despite efforts to foster
local interest in the colony,
several of the animals were
picked off by hunters in 1894.
One beaver was also brought

 

in with a missing foot, evi- ‘1 '
dence that it had been caught '

in a leg-hold trap.

At this point, when the
beaver’s extinction appeared
inevitable, someone in the
Legislature wrote a bill to
protect the few remaining
specimens. This saved the
beaver, for it encouraged con-
servationists to introduce a
few specimens from outside
the state. Subsequently, the
Legislature appropriated funds
to purchase more. But beavers
were hard to find- At the
turn Of the century, only
Michigan, Minnesota, Wiscon-
sin and Wyoming had viable
beaver colonies. Even in

Canada, the species had been *

virtually :wiped out. Canada,
however, " had included some
beavers in its national ex-
hibit at the St. Louis world’s

fair during the summer of '

1904. Seven of these animals

were purchased by New York ‘ '

State, and six of them sur-

vived the transfer to the .

Adirondacks. In 1906, under
the direction of Dr. Harry V.
Radford,’ the biologist in
charge of the state’s trans-
plantation program, 14 more
beavers were imported from
Yellowstone National Park in
Wyoming. As a result of these
efforts by the state and those
of private donors, the colony

on St. Regis Pond again began

to thrive. By ' 1910, the Forest,
Fish and Game Commission
had information about 60 bea-
ver families scattered through
the Adirondack region; in
1915, the animals were esti-
mated to number several
thousand. Since then, the bea-
ver has spread across the
state once more.

But the return of the beaver
brought complaints about the
damage it created: A stream
backed up behind a beaver
dam can flood adjacent farm
lands or undermine nearby
roads. While some of the
complaints were legitimate,

others have been branded a 3

device for pressuring the state
into establishing a trapping
season. In the nineteen-twem
ties, beaver coats were in

style and a single pelt could’ '

bring $50. Bowing to econom«
ic pressure, the Department
of Environmental Conserva-
tion established the policy of
promoting beaver trapping
wherever it could be sus~
tained. As in the rest of the
U.S., wildlife management in

New York is financed by the ”

sale of state licenses to

hunters, fishermen: and trap- -

pers, and these interests are
given priority over those of
the nonconsuming public.
Last year 12,417 beaver
pelts were taken in the state.

extinction, many New York ,'

conservationists feel the regu-
lations protecting it should be

‘. strengthened. The trapping

season is adjusted in accord~
ance with periodic counts of
the beaver population, but
there is n6 limit on the mum-,1
ber of. licenses the state is—
sues, no quota’ on the number
~61 beaver a trapper may take,
and use of the leg—hold trap
is allowed. (This trap con-
sists of two metal jaws ac1
tivated by a spring. A disk
between the open jaws is at-
tached to’ a lever. When an
animal steps on the disk, the
trap is sprung and the jaws
clamp onto the leg. Struggling
to free itself, a wild animal
may gnaw or tear off the-leg
and, thus maimed, escape.
Otherwise it may starve or
freeze to death before the
trapper returns. One study has
shown that 59 per ‘Cent of the
Victims of leg-hold traps are
species of no commercial val-
ueé—dogs, cats, birds, etc.)

ne person who sees
in beavers something
other than commer-
cial yield is Mrs.
Dorothy Richards of Dolge-
ville, a village east of Utica
near the Adirondack Preserve.
A1; 80, Mrs. Richards is known
in theharea as “The Beaver
Lady. " Her interest in Castor
canadensis dates from the
nineteen -’thirties when she
casually agreed to let the

 

" Department of Environmental

Conservation release a pair of
beavers on her property. At
the time, she paid little atten-
tion to wildlife. Some months
passed before she even ob-
tained a glimpse of her ten-
ants. Then one day, while
walking in the woods, she dis-
covered }a beaver dam. Thus
began her career as a beaver-
watcher. After eight years, she
obtained a permit to keep
some of the animals in her

home for study and research. .

She remodeled her living
room, converting half of it
into a glassed-in swimming
pool, with a beaver - sized
swinging door giving the ani-
mals access to her own living
quarters. Then she abducted
two kits from the outdoor
lodge.

Since then, numerous gen-
erations of beavers have lit-
erally roomed with Mrs. Rich-
ards, and thousands of visi-
tors have enjoyed seeing
them free of charge. Over the
years, Mrs. Richards struggled
to . acquire more land. for
Beaversprite, as she has
named her sanctuary. Today

it covers 1,300 acres and con- '
. tains five beaver colonies.
‘ More than 155 kinds of birds

and 54. species ’of mammals,
' ave been sighted in the pre-
serve. In .1960, an endowment 1
was established to assure the,
sanctuary’ s future. "
' I visited Mrs. Richards, and

jwhile we sat talking in her

living room, the tiny door
was suddenly pushed open
and a 60-pound, soaking~wet
beaver waddled across the
floor and climbed into my
hostess’s lap. This was 7-year-
old Eager. He gently accepted ‘
a raw ear of corn from me
and, twirling it between his,
forepaws, stripped it of ker—
nels with his teeth as if he
were some kind of animated
lathe. The sound of his
crunching must have at-
tracted his mate, Busy, for
presently she, too, made an
entrance, followed by two
yearlings.

After admiring and stroking
the beavers, I was granted a
rare privilege that evening:
Mrs. Richards permitted me
to go with her on her nightly
visit to the nearby outdoor-
colony. En route, to my as-
tonishment, she coaxed a por—
cupine down ,out of a tree
and fed it an apple. At the
water’s edge, I was instructed
to hide while Mrs. Richards
shouted across the darkening
pond, “All right, all right.”
From, several . directions rip-_

ﬁles began to form as seven: ~

wild» beavers swam . rapidly
toward their benefactor. Just
as the indoor beavers had
done, the wild ones took car-
rot sticks from Mrs. Rich~
ards’s hand with the utmost
delicacy, never allowing their
lethal teeth even to graze
her fingers. ‘

New Jersey also has its
- beaver buffs. In the southern
part of the state, Hope Saw-
yer Buyukmihci and her hus-
band, Cavit, have transformed
their property into a beaver

sanctuary. Mrs. Buyukmihci, .0

whose book, “Hour of the
Beaver,” describes how this
was done, has also organized
a nonprofit group called The
Beaver Defenders, to further '
the interests of the beaver.

Visits to these two sanc-
tuaries provide persuasive ar-
guments for making the
beaver the New York state
mammal. Besides being clean,
good-natured, intelligent, so-
ciable, cooperative, adaptable
and hard-working, the beaver
is a jack-cf-all-trades. It is a

lumberjack, hydraulic engi-

neer, architect, construction
engineer, carpenter, canal
builder, mason, hair dreSser
and, no doubt, a dozen other
things I haven't thought of.
What other animal is so
qualified to personify such a
diverse people as we are?‘I

Mr. Walter Cronkite

Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.
51 West 52nd Street :“

New York, New YOrk,100l§

Dear Mr.'Cronkite,

You did such a magnificent broadcast at the time
of the passage of the Animal Welﬁare Act of 1966,
that I'm writing to appeal to you to help make sure
the new amendments to the Act (8.19h1 passed b
voice vote in the Senate in December andH.R.5g08
passed by a vote of 33h to 3S.in the House in
February) become law.

Incredible though it seems, we have received
word from an impeccable source that the President
plans to veto this legislation! The final version
is not yet available_because the conference committee
has not yet met to iron out the differences between the
Senate and House-passed bills. The chief provisions
:relate to setting minimum standards for transportation
of animals by air (pups from the "puppy mills" in the
Imiddle west are sent in flimsy crates not unlike lettuce
crates and are subject to no humane regulations in
transit by common carrier). The House bill prohibits
use of the mails and interstate shipment of animals
and birds for fighting (I'm sure you know of the
gruesome dog fight racket which depends on interstate
activity for its financial success).

We'd be happy to supply you with full details
if you wish. It would be tragic if this legislation
failed to be approved. ‘

 




With great appreciation of all you have done
for animals, and heping you.can save this
legislation which has taken five years~to get to
this point,

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
Secretary

Mabamians. The one in Flo-
rence was the ve ry ii rst humane
shelter I’d ever seen .. and
Mrs. John H. Hauerwas, the new

president of the Lauderdaler

County Humane Society, has
informed me just recently that

The Tishomingo County News, Iuka, Miss. 38852 - July 31,JulY 1975

[ off their own hands, they’d think

I didn’t really mean what I
was saying.

Well, I want you to know that
I nearly killed my own self
with such ridiculous thinking
and probably would ’ve been dead
by now if the Chief Investiga-
tor for the Humane Society of ‘
the United States hadn’t finally

made me understand that it was
not MY job or anybody else’s
to try to “save” ALL the ani-
mals other people didn ’t want --
Mhumane “wor ” didn’t just
mean taking in animals, but
was rather to “prevent the suf-
fering 0f animals” -- and that
to prevent the suffering, it was
'necessary to put to death
MILLIONS of unwanted animals
every year.

The HSUS points out clearly
that although it is IRONIC, 95%
of humane “kindness”is killing
the surplus animals -- animals
whose births should have been
prevented in the first place.
The large st national humane
organization in the country, the
HSUS also points out that an
animal is often “saved” from
death merely to go on suffer-
ing.

It was only after being con-
vinced of these facts in a per-
sonal visit with the late Frank
McMahon, the Chief Investiga-
tor to Whom I refer above, that
Art and I could take some of
the 24 animals we had foolishly
let accumulate at our home --
and start having them given a
merciful death by a veterinar-
ian. .

It was with deep sadness that
we learned that Frank McMahon
died on July 1 of this year.
His early death was no doubt
' partially caused by the heart-
breaking job he had as Chief
Investigator for cruelty cases
with the HSUS. . It is also
ironic that we learned of his
death only today, July 27,
shortly after receiving the call
from the woman from Alabama!

the shelter is having major re-
pairs and improvements made
which they expect to be finished
by the end of July. (There are
no humane facilities in Tisho-
. . mingo County, not even a dog
By Mary B._ DOVIS pound —- that is why I said.
, . p V, .. .. .- . the Alabama woman was “for-
- - *Wm*wr~ r f tunate” tohave not one, buttwo!)
* ' ‘ ‘ ' ‘ .. i 3 A few weeks ago, Iwent by
f to see the Colbert County
' Humane Shelter, a fairly new
facility -- and it is well—run
and supervised by Mrs. Norene
Hyde, president of the Colbert
County Humane Society.
Both of these facilities have
, a “night depository” for use
; by peOple who don’t want to
“be seen” leaving their un-
wanted animals -- or who find
stray animals after the shelter
is closed or on Sundays. (But
Mrs. Hyde told me that even
with the night depository avail-
able for use by the public, an
unbelieveable number of people
pass right by the shelte' and
‘ go on to the landfill just ‘JGIOW
the shelter, and desert tit-ppm-
ful animals there instead of
placing them in the night de-
positmy.)

But, as I often do, I’m gett—V
ing away from the point Ireally
wanted to make in this article:
and that is that there is a big
difference in being kind and
being foolish -- and it took mea
heck of a long time to learn
the difference.

For the first nine or ten
years after we moved back to
Mississippi and realized there
were no humane facilities in
the area, we tried to take into
our own home all the strays
that we found ourselves or that
were brought to our home by
peeple who learned we had com-
passion for homeless, mis-
treated animals.

Also, because I wrote and
talked so much about “humane
treatment of animals” and
preached kindness to all help-
less creatures, I was afraid
if I refused to accept ALL the
animals people wanted to get

{INDNESS VS 14‘U(JI.ISI~INESS

Sunday, I received a call from
a woman asking if I’d take a
kitten that had been dumped
near her home.

I told her that I couldn’t ~-
and suggested that she take it
to a veterinarian and have it
put to death (the most humane
thing to do for any animal that
nobody wants).

She said the veterinarian he re
(in Tishomingo County) wouldn’t
be open on Sunday and besides,
she livedin ALABAMA!

' When I tried to explain to
the ‘ woman that I’d finally
learned a few years ago that
only afool would think he could
take into his own home every-
body else’s unwanted animals,"
she got quite perturbed and hung

up on me right in the middle
of a sentence. '

Well, it was like so
many other times when l’ve
wished I had thought of the
right thing to say at the right
time. But no, it was only after
she had hung up that it dawned
on me fully that she had Said
she lived in ALABAMA.

What I wish Ihad told her
was that living in Alabama, she
is very fortunate to have not
one, but two well-run humane
shelters within a reasonable
distance: one in Lauderdale
County located in an easy-to-
reach spot in Florence; and one"
in Colbert County, in an even
easier-to-reach spot on Hwy.
43, near Tuscumbia.

Dear Friends of the Outdoors:

For nnore than 25 years Hank Andrews‘ daily columns
on the outdoors appeared in The Cleveland Press,

But when Hank: reached retirement age, he decided to
trade the hassle of. living near a big city for the solitude of a
lake in southern Ohio.

I have been given the job of trying to replace Hank, a;
task that is no mean feat.

Should you have any news tips or information you
would like to send along, I would be happy to hear from you.
Also, would you please change your mailing list to reflect
the change in outdoors writer at The Press?

Since rely,

Hank Andrews is freelancing and doing a monthly
column for Fur“=~Fish_Game. You can write him at
.1231 Arrowhead Dr. , Dellroy, Ohio, or phone him

Dear Christine,

Greetings after this very long time, in
which however, I have known of your continuing
benefits to our wildlife. (we spoke of you at
some length wn n Ellen and Dutch smith visited
in Guernsey, where I've lived until recently.)

Perhsps you have heard of my latest book,
published eerly this month: Elbe Twilight Sees:

.A Blue Whale's Journey” (journey into death by

explosive herpoon, that is). would it be useful

for you to have s few cepies?' If so, I'll be
glad to see that you get them. Your promotion

to boycott Japanese goods is 8 wonderful piece of
propaganda, for which many congratulations.

Best wishes always,

Dear Sally,

It was good to hear from you, and I'm.delighted that
you've written a beautiful whale book. Yen must he were
happy about the wag'it has been.retiewed, and you are vory
kind to offer me copies. I do have one which I've begun
with.much pleasure but have been prevented from finishing
by the incredible pressure of work, a great deal of it for
Whales. This week, for example, we've had hearings on two
bills affecting whales already and expect another whale
hearing Friday. I wish I could enlist you to come and
testify now that you're back in the United States.

Thanks for your kind words about the boycott effort.
There are now Resolutions pending which would impose a U.S.
Government embargo on products of foreign enterprises that
engage in commercial whaling. The Senate version says
fisheries products, the House version all products, but
they would mostly be fish. in any case. A copy of the
House bill is enclosed f your information together with
the circular letter g t out in a rush in case you might

"NEW ORGANIZATION has been
. , formed in Dallas. With no ps-iid ot~
ﬁcers or ﬁeld workers, it: is ecn'nposed
of mostly professional people, although
those from ail walks of life are en-
couraged to join. About the only re—
quired qualification for membership is
compassion for animal pets, because the
group, known as the Humane Society of
Dallas County, has begun its early
trumpeting to tell the world that it. will
serve as a watchdog for problems in:
volving dogs.

“Our real purpose," said devoted
Mrs. Paul (Donna) Snyder, “is. to
make the public aware of the uniinag~
tnable situation that has developed in
our city and area because of dogs run"
ning loose without collar or registration
tag.

“It is incredible that recently, during
a whirlwind campaign to round up dogs
prowling free in just a few shopping
areas, of the 700 that were picked. up to
be sent to the city pound, only seven of
them were wearing a tag.

“FURTHERMORE, there is a big
cost: attached to this job of. picking up
dogs. The city figures that every time
a dog has to be caught and brought
in, $7.50 comes out of: the budget that
is supported by the taxpayer.

“It breaks down like this. First, the
animals are kept for five days in order
to give the owner a chance “to claim
them. The pound tee is $3. Registration
is $2 and feed is ﬁfty cents a day.” she
added.

“Just in case there are those who
might accept us as faultfinders in the
movement, I’d like to point out that we
recognize that the city has no alterna~
ﬁve, but to do the best it can with
such a low budget. During the cam—
paign the other day, they used all 10
of their trucks and drivers to roundup
the animals,” she added.

Mrs. Snyder’s house pets are limit~
ed to three spayed cats.

“It has become obvious that people
simply are not living up to their re-
sponsibiilty of. owning their pets,” she
said. “We were visiting the Dallas
pound to make pictures and gather
factual data for a display to show dur-
ing our educational campaigns," she
said. “The tiny dogs are kept in the

Watchdog group

for pets formed

same pens as where the big dogs are
held, but, of course, the shelter people
don’t have any other choice if they
don’t have the budget to build different
accommodations. There was one big
Boxer there that had killed two other
dogs the day before,” she pointed out.

According to the best guesstiniation,
there are about 150,000 dogs in Dallas,
she said. Last year, the pound in Dal.~
las was host to 49.600 dogs. and cats
brought in by the 32 field workers
hired by the city.

“The present shelter occupies about
two and a halt acres, butt.hey’relook~
ing {or another site iorimproved facili-
ties since the budget has been assured
ior such impmvement," she added.

Mrs. Snyder said that she has
talked to Douglas Scott, regional direc-
tor of. the Humane Society of the Unit
ed States, and he has assured her that
his organization has a subcommittee at
work in Texas now. “"l.‘hey're working
with the Agriculture Department in
making studies of all the cities in Texan
as to determine what can be done
about the animal. pet problems,” she
said.

OF THE 49,000 ANIMALS impound
ed in Dallas County in. 1972, about 7,000
were sold to medical institutions, ac~
cording to Mrs. Snyder. “I don’t know
what was paid for them, or‘ for what
specific research program they were
user,” she said, “but this points 'up
even more need for pet owners to be
more concerned for the welfare of ani-
mats.”

“Our organization’s purpose Will be
aimed at all humane—or inhumane-v-
aspects of the pet problem,” she conn-
tinued. “Although I don’t believe that
there are any laws applicable to cats
insofar as requiring a leash, cats
should be accorded the same attention
as any other pet. Of course, if some-
one were to call and complain that a
cat was becoming a nuisance on anoth~
er’s property, it would be a ditterent
story—~it they could catch the cat.”

Mrs. Snyder, who has her own Lyn—
co advertising agency and spends
much of her spare time designing and
making her own clothes, is the wife of
a Dallas architect.

THIS is A SUBJECT that raises much (All-ID
emotional protest on the part of cat— DEFENSIVE
lovers. and considerable ridicule and
defensvve rhetoric from those who use (or
profit from the use of) cats in the
laboratory. What is the truth? How can
you protect your cat and cats in general?
Let me state right now that I am both a
cat-owner and a biologist and know. from
years of experience, whereof I speak on
both counts.
The problem is not the same as that of
dogs. Many places have dog shelters and
no cat shelters; they run advertisements
to place dogs but do not for cats; people
rush to defend dogs and ignore cats. Cats
are usnally simply killed or sold to
laboratories. My own pet of fifteen years
was tam”; from my porch and disposed of
before i could come home that same day
and. finding her gone, claim her. Dogs in
that city were held some time, obviously. x;
pedigreed cats were allowed twenty-four
hours-«but the deﬁnition of these people
for pedigree was long fur, or Siamese »

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thanks very much for seeing me and supplying
all the information.

Here is Barbara Harrison's address:

100 Fairview Square, 2H
Ithaca, New York 14850

One question I don't find answered——on my
tape: what year did you start the Animal Welfare
Institute?

Also, ithhere any very recent news regarding
whales? Have the Russians and Japanese field ob-
jections to the 1974 IWC rulings? And how does it

ook for the porpoises being killed in tuna nets?
Abs anything significant happened lately either for
or against them?

I proudly display the boycott bumper sticker.
Hopefully, when the fall quarter begins I can bring
this issue to the attention of those who might care
and possibly we can get something going on our cam—
pus.

Once again, thanks very much for your help.

1) The WI was founded in 1951.

2) The Japaneae and Rugsians did net file objectiens ts the 197h
IWC rulings. Tam Garrett’s article which is enclesaé tells clearly
why they did not. In meetings to be hald in the next couple of manths
in London and La Jolla wa will get a picture of whether the JapaneSa
are gaing t0 fight against what Gaga; to happen under tha harms 9f tha
"Australian Amanﬁment" or net. My gnegs is that they will and that
theywhole battle is gaing to have ta be fought aver and aver again,
with only a very amall giving uf ground each time. It is vitally'imw
pertant to keep tha boyeatt-presaure an evar mmre strongly.

Dear Sir/Ms,

I am currently researching a book on ethical issues
raised by our treatment of animals. I have come across your Mill‘s
'Information Report‘ and found it most useful. I would be grateful IO¢*£$'
if you could send me a copy of the article by Dr. Orlans on Science ChQatlb
Fiirs, mentioned in the Julbeeptember 1973 issue. I would also
like to have a copy of this particular issue,if you have one, and
also the "Facts about Furs" leaflet. In addition, the library +'1%~“**L
I was using did not have any 1974 issues; perhaps you could send them .

too.

I also have a general query. The two areas my book
'will deal with in most detail are vivesection and the rearing and
slaughtering of food animals. I can obtain material on the former
subject from United Action for Animals, here in New York, but none
of the animal welfare societies I have contacted know much about
food animals. In particular, I want to find out the extent and
degree of intensive farming practices here. I previously worked
in England, where Ruth Harrison, as you may know, wrote an excellent
expose of these practices in England, but there appears to be nothing
comparable to her book (Animal Machines) here. Do you have any
information on this subject? If you have files on it, could you
photocopy them, at my eipense, or should I come down to Washington?

Or do you know of anywhere here that.I might obtain the information.

I realize I have asked a lot of questions, and apologise
for the inconvenience I am causing you. To cover any expenses, and

also to support your valuablegwork, I enclose a small donation.

if you can help me regarding a project on which I am

I am attempting to put together a book for teen-

with respect to Species that are endangered or nearly
extinct. There is no problem finding men in this cate-
gor'- the Program of the Fish and Wildlife Service em-
plogg several. But my publisher insists that I include
women in the field, as well. And I am having some dif-
ficulty in locating some.

Names of any women doing thi ind of work is what I
need; and of course where th y are located. If you have
this information could you send it on to me? Thank you
very much.

I would very much appregﬁate it if you could help.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

 

MEN, BEASTS, AND GODS

”A rich and readable treatment of animals and men, packed with telling details
and always moving," writes Mark Van Doren in praise of MEN, BEASTS, AND GODS: A
HISTORY OF CRUELTY AND KINDNESS TO ANIMALS by Gerald Carson. ”Witty, too, and wise,-
as any book on the subject had better be." To be published by Charles Scribner's
Sons on November 30, 1972 ($8.95), MEN, BEASTS, AND GODS traces man's relationship
with the animal world from the Stone Age to the present day.

Prehistoric man, says Mr. Carson, had great respect for animals. Many early
gods, and a number of Greek and Roman gods, bore animal characteristics or were
believed to assume animal forms at will. Later, the Roman passion for gladiatorial
combat led to a great deal of cruelty to animals, and this hardened attitude was
incorporated into the Christian ethic. In the Middle Ages it was not uncommon for an
animal to be put on trial in a court of law for offenses against man. It was not
until the nineteenth century, with the founding of the Royal Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals,that the animal protection movement got under way.

MEN, BEASTS, AND GODS documents man's inhumanity to the animals of this world,
ranging from the cruelties of the rodeo to the mounting of live insects and sea
creatures to be worn as jewelry. But it also chronicles the ongoing efforts to
use public opinion and the law for the animals' protection. MEN, BEASTS, AND GODS
is more than a history of man's contradictory attitudes toward the animal kingdom.
It is also a plea for a rational and humanitarian approach to the problem of animal
protection. "The animals could do very well without us," Mr. Carson concludes,

"but we cannot do without them.”

MEN, BEASTS, AND GODS is receiving critical acclaim:

”The first really good book by a really good writer -- about a field
of ever-increasing concern to millions of thoughtful people."

--Cleveland Amory
President, The Fund for Animals

”An informed and humane study of man's relationship to animals.
Gerald Carson brings a philos0phic dimension to his history of the
place of the animal in human consciousness."

--Publishers' Weekly

"An unusual book which should appeal to animal lovers as well as
historians interested in the progress of pOpular superstitions,
sports and sentiment."

--Kirkus Reviews

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Would you give me a quote on pet ceme-
teries and an opinion as to why people go to so
much trouble and expense to bury their compan-
ion animals; and also yourfview of animal bur~
ials? ‘

.Asking the question does not imply
any desire to direct the answer. I suspect that
you regard all this as an aberration ~- but I
am not trying to guess£

When you were showing me your new
work area I asked if you had any material on
this subject and you told me there was no fold-
er on the subject in your archives but there
might be something under some other heading.

If you do come across anything would you please
run the item through your xerox machine? I
should be very grateful.

If you are a regular reader of the
New York Times, and I am sure you are, you must
have noticed evidence of a very sophisticated
campaign of publicity favorable to rodeo. It
seems odd that the Times would tumble for the
promotion of this industry, especially in view
of their generally good editorial position on
humanitarian issues.

Gentlemen:

I am planning a story on animal protection laws in
New Jersey (or lack of them) and comparable coverage
elsewhere. An editor has suggested that we are sadly
lacking many protective laws that are in effect in
other states. ~

I have been in contact with our legislature with reference
to pending bills dealing with spay clinics and animals

for experimental purposes. A reporter told me that New
Jersey is the only state in the country where a dog-
catcher or dogwarden can make a profit on the sale of
unclaimed or unlicensed dogs. Is this true?

The enclosed clipping, from my newspaper, attests to

the notoriety New Jersey has gained by the percentage

of painful—to-animals operations performed here. It makes
reference to a SAPL report and a Department of Agricuhure
paper. Could you possibly send a c0py of each?

Any information you have on current or pending New Jersey
or Federal legislation or statistics on New Jersey in
particular would be greatly appreciated. Also, if you

know of other sources of information I could solicit here
for my story, I would appreciate the information.

The assistance given to me by your organization
and other humane groups was very much apprec~

As I informed you earlier there is going to
be a conference here in Claremont at the colleges
concerning the Rights of Non-human Nature. I

am sending you information on the conference
and the status of observers at it. Also enclosed
is a tentative list of participants and topics.

If I can be of any service to please let me
know; Also if you plan to attend the conference
as an observer please notify either John Rodman
(whose address is in the sheets I've sent you)
or myself as soon as possible as there are only
a limited number of seats.

Thank you for your time and interest.

April 18-20, 1974 and National Audubon Society
Claremont, California " .

gackground. Do rights pertain only to human beings? The recent asking of this
question - by thinkers and scholars in such widely scattered fields as philosophy,l
biology, law, history, anthropology, theology, literature, and political science -
suggests the tentative emergence of a new, postshumanist perspective.

 

Process philosophers and theologians since Whitehead have stressed the continuity of
life from non—human to human forms, and contemporary biology has rendered questionf .
able the distinction conventionally drawn between the inanimate and the animate.

. Analytic philosophers have now begun to conclude that the basic arguments for
icertain human rights apply also to certain classes of non-human beings (e.g.,
animals, but not plants). This comes at a time when ethological research has .
coincidentally made it necessary to abandon or reformulate many traditional notions
of a sharp, qualitative distinction between human beings and 'brutes', and some '
naturalists have argued that the hierarchical notion of man's superiority rests

upon a criterion arbitrarily selected by man. Meanwhile, recent experiments have
led some writers to infer the existence of a 'primary perception' and sentience

in plant life — which has far-reaching implications, if (as Bentham and the humane
movement argued) rights pertain to'all sentient beingsr. Some ecologically-oriented
thinkers go further and argue, in the tradition of Aldo Leopold's 'land ethic“, 1
that rights pertain to all members of an ecological system, even to rocks. A legal-
scholar has recently argued the case for 'legal rights for natural objects' (meaning
forests, estuaries, etc.), and Justice Douglas has injected this idea into the '
judicial arena. (See his opinion in Sierra Club v. Morton, April 1972.)

 

In this context of rapidly emerging ideas, some writers have treated the idea of ‘
'rights' primarily as a device used by man to justify his domination and exploits--’
tion of the non-human. Others have argued for the extension of the concept of
rights so as to include and protect non~human forms of life. To this, some have
responded that such an 'extension' smacks of paternalism and merely extends the
anthropomorphic fallacy: 'rights' is a human moral/legal notion inappropriate to‘
be predicated of ecological relationships. From another perspective, however,
the modern notion of 'human rights' is a shrunken vestige of a much earlier culture.
in which human rites implied the sacredness of all forms of life, a perspective
reflected even in later philosophies that included hll animals' within the

sphere of (normative) Natural Law and therefore of justice.

Purpose of the conference. The time seems ripe for a systematic interchange among I
thinkers who have been pursuing the question of non-human rights and related topics.
in relative isolation from one another. The purpose of the conference is to bring ;
together approximately fifteen such persons from various fields for an intensive
three—day series of discussions. By facilitating the exchange of ideas and
constructive criticism, we hope to provide a situation in which the thinking of

the participants will umvs a step forward. ~ ._ . - »

Format. The basic activity of the conference will be the discussion of papers
written by the participants eSpecially for the conference and circulated in

March so that they can be read before the conference begins. Conference time
will thus be devoted to diSCUSbion, rather than to formal lectures or the pre-
sentation of papers. After the conference, participants will have an opportunity
to revise their papers before publication. Publication of the conference papers
in book form is an integral part of the conference plan to stimulate a wider

and more reflective scholarly and public discussion of the idea of non-human
rights and its implications.

Observers. In order to foster an atmOSphere of intimate give and take, the
conference will not be open to the general public. A limited number of seats
will be available for observers who have a particular scholarly or professional
interest in the topic. Since the number of seats is limited, the number of
observers will be rationed, and interested persons should apply in advance to
the conference coordinator.

Conference sessions are scheduled as follows: Thursday (April 18), 9 a.m. -
noon, 2-5 p.m., evening free; Friday (April 19), 9 a.m. - noon, 7-10 p.m.,
afternoon free; Saturday (April 20), 9 a.m. - noon, 2-6 p.m. Papers will be
grouped in such a way that a session will discuss several related papers to-
gether. It will not be possible, therefore, for observers to 'drop in' for a
particular hour to hear a particular person. Moreover, the discussions will not
make much sense unless observers have read the papers in advance. C0pies of the
conference papers will be available, along with the final conference schedule,
by late March. They can be purchased at cost from the conference coordinator
($1.00 for the entire set, plus postage for out-of-town observers). There is

no registration fee.

For observers attending from out-of-town, the nearest place to stay is Griswold's
Inn, 555 W. Foothill Blvd., Claremont, California 91711 (telephone: 714-626-2411).
This is within walking distance of Pitzer College, where most or all conference
sessions will be held, and where inexpensive meals will be available. Because
of the small size of the conference, there is no reduced rate at Griswold's for
conference observers: single rooms are $16, doubles are $18. Other places to
stay include Howard Johnson's Motor Lodge (721 So. Indian Hill Blvd., Claremont)
and the Rodeway Inn (840 So. Indian Hill Blvd., Claremont), which are more dis-
tant but still walkable by energetic persons. (While a grant from the National
Audubon Society will pay the expenses of conference participants, observers will
have to bear their own eXpenses.)

The City of Claremont (site of the Claremont Colleges) is approximately 35 miles
due east of the Los Angeles Civic Center via the San Bernardino Freeway (Indian
Hill Blvd. exit). The nearest airport is at Ontario, California (approximately
15 minutes from Claremont by automobile). If out-of-town observers arriving by
plane at Ontario will notify the coordinator of their arrival time, it may be
possible to arrange for them to be met.

Dear Mrs. Stevens,

I felt quite foolish when our letters crossed in
the mail. Your Opinions, comments and encouraging sug—
gestions were a badly needed shot in the arm. Upon
completion, I had sent the manuscript of “An Animal
Alphabet for Adults" to a literary agent who surmised
that the information in the book was opinion for the
most part, and not factual in nature. He more-or-less
put it that since I am not a recognised expert in the
field of animal conservation, no one would be interested
in what I had to say. He also felt that illustrations
were extraneous and that the book should have been
written as a straight factual account. At that point
I realized I should be dealing with people who had
compassion for animals and their problems.

Your suggestion about “a sympathetic and experienced
editor" was an excellent one. How do I go about finding
such a person? And also a sympathetic publisher?

Your letter has given me the encouragement needed
to tackle a rewrite job. I will keep you advised of

my progress. Thank you so much for your interest.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs. Bemelmans and Mrs. Stevens, éMUD(

You are directly responsible for my becoming aware
ef the horrers inflicted upon animals for human pleasure,
health, and profit. I originally came across some of your
material when you were actively trying to get the Labora—
tory Animal Welfare Act passed into law, and have been
following your advice ever since.

The facts you presented in your material both shocked
and amazed me, as I had assumed that laboratory animals
and all other animals exploited for human use were, as a
matter of decency, treated humanely. In my way I have
tried to hip, by writing to the peOple you suggest, hav—
ing petitions signed, and sending "Letters to the Editor"
(at least M-6 of which have been published).

Two years age, the time came for me to start my
Masters' thesis in Art Education, and I decided to use
this opportunity to write a book which would call attention
ts animal abuse in a way which would appeal ts these who
would not be aware of, or care much about animal problems.
The enclosed copy of this manuscript is the culmination
of two years of research, writing and drawing. I would
very much like to have this book published, for if not,
it's whole purpose will be defeated. Any help or advice
you can give me would be gratefully accepted — as we do

have a common goal.

Very truly yours,

Rhoda Kopp

'Washington, 3.0. 20007

Dear hrs. Stevens,

Sorry to have been slow about answering your kind letter, but we've
been snowed under with finishing the book.

heavens no: no surgical study of anatomy. Instead the study is to
be approached by the reader externally with his eyes and fingers,
two of his vital primate characterisths. "We are all vertebrates,
because we all have bachbones.nade up of vertebrae. 'You can feel
the dog's as well as your own with the tips of your fingers. We

are manmals, because...." And so forth. The emphasis is on the
fin to paw to hand transition. At the end of the book I finish

by (I hepe) making the point that-with our dextrous hands we control
the world. The world's animal nepnlation is at the mercy of our hands
and brains, and we should use them to rescue our animal.relatives
from extinction. Such.is my feeling for our subject I've tried to
cover far too much ground I fear, but it’s too late now.

I debated the inclusion of your organization with our editor, since
I was a bit concerned that the.material you sent me, aimed more at
teachers, might put ideas into otherwise more or less innocent minds.
The editor, however, cpted for inclusion on the basis that we are
also to an extent aiming at teachers.tu3~

This all reminded me of several things I'd almost forgot. In fifth
grade my son was put in charge of the teacher's hamster. After some
months he began to die slowly and horribly of a malignancy. my son
became.more and more upset about the whole thing, while the teacher
did nothing. I had to go to school, collect the hamster, and take
him.to a vet to have him put to death.

Then again in junior high school my son, feeling pressured by the
teacher to come up with some sort of science fair idea but being him?
self very non—scientific, decided to do an experiment to see whether
our fish could live in water from the Hudson;hiver. When I pointed
out to him.the fact that they were only just barely making it in our
ideal aquarium, he saw how silly his plan was.

 




In both these episodes the peOple involved were good, kind, animal—
oriented individuals, and this hag led me to the conclusion that
animals really don’t belong in school. Among other thing there is
the oroblem of reading and teuwerature in the classroom over was kends.
Then too the teacher mnst have eyes in the becvgof her head to be
sure anihals aren't niolested by those children with irustrations to
vent.

Our book is set entirely within the walls of the ASPOA's Education
Degertment where they keep a collection of castoffs—~animals peeple
couldn't or wouldn't treat proberly. vie ma<_e the point that wild
animals SdQ“LO not be kept as pets, and that dom lestic animals re31r11re
a great de eal more time and attention thant most as Oli)l€ aenerally

-L.

assume when they casually buy some "cute" little 1a all oi 1ur.

S.

We do not go into what happens to most of a humane oc1“""'s are as
anihals~—I have already3as l say,tried to fit too much in as it i
Personally I think the most 1w} 1:1e societies cone as 01‘s st they

can with all the animals scale have DQYOW e1 ay, and l tLLnn it
MUCL better £01 an enwra pto end no i:11 a gas hamber or lao ooratory
than under the whee ole of a car or Sb tarving to dea h in a snow bank.
But that I don't go into in the book either, except to.nention in

.1

}oassin the importance 01 havins one's nets neutered.
E.) D 4..

The apnendix listing of zoos, museums, nature centers, and wildlife

refuges is re her quirky. The 1people11ho didn't answer our letter
aren't there, which.mahes ior sorie rather odd exclus ions s, and I've

had to rely on.material sent us to decide whether a place is legitimate
or a tourist trap. Space has also been a severe limitation, since
this is a children's book, not an encyclonedia.

On the basis of all this, you can decide if you.want to be in or
not. Since no one with any sense will ever read the book, it probably
hardly matters: Anyway if we don't hear from.you, we'll leave you it.

Congratulations on yours pQrood h.

2 cos, nature centers, and wildlife refuges offering programs designed
to help children learn about animals, their care and conservation.

we should line to knOW'if your organisation sends out material on
wildlife conservation that might be informative and useful to young

Wet-care particularly interested in a brief history of each type
of animal, prevalence in the animal population, care and feeding,
what it should cost to buy the best of the breed, how to tell
if you're actually getting a good animal, and cost of upkeep.
Could you supply us with any information about the current pet
market or pets in general?

We also plan to include color photos of each animal we include
and would welcome suggestions about locating suitable pictures.

Deer ﬁr. Winemiller,

I was sorry to have mieeeé your call about tending
federal legislation. Now that Congress has adjourned, you
will doubtless went to give a report of the outcome of ’
pending bills. The Fmrine Mammal Protecﬁon Act was passed.
So was the amendment to the law providing for a criminal
penalty for shooting at animals from.eircreft (this gives
the Department of the Interior the autherity to enforce it).
The Senate peeeed a Resolution calling for international pro~
teotion of polar bears. Though not identical to the House
verSion, which was stronger, it should be helpful in making
poseible progress at the international level.

Neither the endangered species bill nor the bill on
predator control passed. We will have towwoek herd to get
good bills on these two subjects passed in the next Congress.

With appreciation of your excellent work,

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
Secretary
