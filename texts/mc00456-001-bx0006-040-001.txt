SIR,——Dogs are “used” as living sacriﬁces because their
bodies are larger and more easily handled than, say, cats or
guinea pigs (hundreds of these are “ used ”) ; and dogs, also,
are easily obtained, and managed, and are more near
to ‘their masters in type. Vivisectors, we know, are
earnest men with high ideals, but how a man who knows
a dog’s nature, and who really loves a dog, can take
a healthy dog and cut out,vsay, a kidney, say both kidneys,
from its body under anaesthetics, then let it recover conscious-
ness, and perhaps for days or weeks, in cold blood, take note of
the effects on the caged dog till it dies or is put out of its
suffering—this beats one’s comprehension. It is done to ﬁnd
means to prevent disease and suffering in man and in animals
also, regardless of the rights of the sacriﬁced—~a tragic mistake.
Is there not disease enough in the world to study without
creating it? Are there not humane means of saving life
ready to our hand? If we only better the environment and the
education of the people, then where we would save one by
vivisection, by foul means, we would save a thousand by fair .
means. It is said the medical profession is solid for vivisection.
I sent a parliamentary petition to abolish vivisection in dogs for
signature to all my medical neighbours. It was sent to twenty-
-three medical men. Eleven signed the petition and twelve

refused.
