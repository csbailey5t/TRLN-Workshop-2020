happy to work without pay in bringing aid and

“Irreverence for life.

s.piece of news comes from emerica‘nhich deeply'concerns the
pacifist movement as a whole and pacifist parents irxparticular.
Emlﬁﬁkwmmuzimmﬂdﬁsmﬂimhw,bMJngﬁngfmra"MMmm"
variety of vivisection in the ﬁcvemher issue of the Coronet, deeply
deplores what he describes as a distressing development in his
country. ”the e ncouracgeme In: of umesirafined au’dmal experiment at ion
by high school students. " '

He exrlains that not only are the school children all over the
U.S. allowed and encouraged to vivisect animals in the quest for
"knowledge" but cages of small animnls such as hamsters and guinea
pigs are being displayed so that the children can watch their
occupants slowly dying of starvation frmn a vitamenydeficient diet,
while in other cages can be observed the thriving of similar animals
fed on a.halanced diet.

iEven more horribly the National Cancer Institute is providing
facilities for allowing Children to watch over a period cf’three
weeks, mice dying from cancers artificially implanted into them.

For his radiation experiments on nearly 500 animals, witnessed
by many children of his neighbourhood, a 19—yesr~old student from

I

Utica, New York, was awareded a science prize.

AS everyone who has ever had any eXperience with the bringing up
of children knows, the only way to inculcate into them a reverence for
life, and habits of kindness and consideration for animals and their
fellow creatures, is constantly to check any signs of cruelty, violence
and carelessness.

UnleSs the public wakes up to where the irreverence for life is
leading us, and makes effective protest, we shall have a world of
heartless robots, entire populations of eXperimental scientists, such
as those Who/even.nQW'feeding babies under six months of age with
live polio Virus in the State Reformatory for'ﬁomen at Clinton, New
Jersey, the imprisoned mothers having, it is stated, given their
"persdssion".

iBritish pacifists must immediately arouse themselves to prevent
this deliberate training into violence reported by Paul Kearney free
crossing the ntlantic. — ﬁdﬁd‘ﬁlhhﬂ-TYSOH, 9, Park Lane, Selsey,

WASHINGTON 16, D. C.

KELLOGG 7-0580

March 2h, 1958
Dear Christine:

Thanks ever so much for the copies of Mr. Porter's letters to
You and Miss Draper.

I have delayed this acknowledgment in part because I had to catch
up with my work last week after returning from Florida. Incidentally, al-
though my trio was brief, I derived refreshment from the warm sun, and in
particular from a tour of the Everglades National Park with a guide from
National Audubon, which conduc s such tours by station wagon and boat out of
Miami. It is a joy to be in such places (of which there are too few)
'where all wildlife without exception is protected . Even a big rattlesnake
we found sunning himself on the road was regarded simply as a subject for
photographs. ThD birds and alligators were magnificent, each playing his
own vital role in balancing their habitat. (Almost too late, the authorities
in F1crida have discovered that the alligator is beneficial.)

The other reason for my delay in replying is that there seemed
little to say except to express my disappointment3vvhich is very keen because
I had entertained very high hopes for Mr. Porter's willingness to work in this
country, for which he is eminently qualified by his evrerience in Britain.

Youzask for my advice. What can I say?‘ He has declined
very clearLy and definitely.

I do think he exaggerates his anticipation of difficulty as a
”foreigner." In this country, we are mainly of European ancestry, and
the English in particular we think of as our cousins. There is undoubtedly
a good deal of prejudice of that nat.re in this country, but I don't think it

is an obstacle in the scientific world in which he would be working.

Also, I have a feeling that perhaps we offered him too small a
salary. I would like him to know that this is due to the fact that we
were trying to stretch out available funds for this purpose to encompass a
five year period. Althdigh we felt we could not 5 fely guarantee more
than three years without additional funds, there was a VPKYggOOd chance in my
opinion to make the aSSetSIast five years, with proper management such as I had
in mind. chever, this is probably all extraneous because Mr.
Porter quite definitely disclaims any personal motive in declining your offer.
Nevertheless, he might reasonably haveeaxpected better compensation for a man

of his professional status.

MT. Porter further comments that the money could be utilized to
advantage in other ways. That is true except for the fact that Mrs,
Brookings‘ giftwwas never consummated, being contingent (she said) on his
acceptance of your offer of employment. I have seen her only once since
I returned; we have not had tine to sit down together and talk things over.

Hope I will see you during your next trip to'Washington.

Yours sincerely,
ﬂ

 




MEDICAL IESEARCH COUNCIL

LABORATORY'ANIMAIS BUREAU,
M.R.C. Laboratories, Holly Hill,
Hampstead, London, N.W}3.

24th February 1958.

Dear Mrs . Stevens ,

Thank you for your letter of the 18th.February and for the very generous
offer of a post with the A.W.I.

I feel there are a few points which need clearing up for'both of us
before I make a final decision and the thing that gives me a degree of concern
is the fact that during my recent visit, I was purely and simply accepted.by
the laboratories as a visitor from Britain and they were prepared to listen to
what I had to say and accept with certain reservations any suggestions I made.
As an actual member of the A.W.I., would this very happy state of affairs con—
timue (I have my doubts!)? Open conflict between the A.W.I. and the labs.,
would be to their advantage, since they could always quote me as a foreigner
and.might even make capital out of the fact that I did represent a country that
had legislation on the use of animals for vivisection. The introduction of
legislation is the one thing they really fear and undoubtedlyuthe Chicago thugs
would Openly declare war at the first Opportunity and in doing so, close the
doors of every laboratory in my face. If such a position was to arise, it
‘would indeed handicap the.A.W;I. and eventually kill anything I attempted to do.
I would like very much to come back to the USA but let us be quite logical about
this. Would you not be better advised to use this money of Mrs. Brooking's
to repeat the sort of thing I did last year and get some person over to make
a three month's tour each year; some different personality each year. I am
sure the laboratories would be prepared to accept a visitor each year and in
this way the thin edge of the wedge which I managed to insert, would.be well
and truly driven in. This is my honest to goodness opinion and I think you
would be doing yourself a.greater service than.by having a permanent fixture
which might even cause you embarrassment. Anyway, please give this your
serious consideration and do not be misled by my 'flash in the pan' success.

If you, on second thoughts, decide that perhaps your offer was somewhat hasty,
I will in no way feel hurt or disappointed, because the last thing I would want
to do is to enter intp a contract which might cause embarrassment to us both.

I have had a letter*fromIRohweder and while he has given me credit for
certain intelligent Observations, his comments about my sponsor are, to say the
least, venomous. He said his peOple were apprehensive before my visit but all
his reports were most satisfactory. I objected to certain remarks he made
about dogs. I also pointed out the fact that I was disappointed.at not meeting
him.personally in San Francisco as I still felt that the.A.W.I. could.become an
organization complementary to the.American Scientist. I told him that I
refused to discuss the procurement of dogs and that, as he prObably knew, the
law in this country protects the dog from every angle. Dr. Lane-Fetter
approved of my comments to thweder and thought it quite a feather in.Y0ur cap

for them to report my visit at all, since everyone knows i was sponsored'hY

13h King St., Columbus, Mississippi,
February h,l962.

Christine Stevens, President,
Animal welfare Institute,

22 East 17th St.,

New York 3, N.Y.

Dear Christine:

Thanks for your letter of January 31. It would indeed be much
easier to discuss these matters personally, but that is impossible
at the moment.

I an glad to know that the cost of maintaining quarters for
animals used in research can be included in federal grants. Also,
that dome funds are available for the construction of housing for
experimental animals.

I still feel that the proposed bill set]! sets up too
rigid requirements for scientific experiments on animals. You
greatly underestimate, in my opinion, the sensitivity of federal
officials to public opinion. No administration could afford to have
repeated criticism of the treatment of experimental animals under
grants from federal funds, if they had the authority to terminate the
abuses. Actually, I doubt that there have been many such abuses
under federal research projects. I raise the following special points:

I) The need or desirability for the special licensing of
individual scientists or laboratories to me seems doubtful. Such
a license is in fact given when a grant is made. Any additional
measure of competence seems unnecessary.

2) I agree that records, laboratories, and animal quarters
operating under federal grants should be Open to inspection at any
time by the Secretary of Health, Education and welfare, but I would
object to a special corps of inspectors.

3) I doubt that the degree of pain to be endured by any
experimental animal or the precise operative procedures can properly
be specified by 12W'(I do not imply that the current bill does attempt
so to specify). As new anesthetics and procedures are developed and
new problems arise, changes must be made in the rules. Therefore, I
think that these details should best be prescribed by the Secretary
and the rules be subject to change from time to time as may be needed.
In any case, it will probably be the Department of Health, Education
and welfare that will have to enforce whatever law is passed. I suspect
that the Secretary would be more diligent to enforce rules that he
himself has promulgated than he would be to enforce the details of a
law with which he may not be fully in sympathy.

h) Minimum standards of care and of housing for experimental
animals are indeed required, but these again should be subject to
change, as better cages are designed and better methods of care are
developed.

 




5) Records must of course be kept of every scientific experiment.
The design of experiments, however, is so varied and kinds df experimental
animals so numerous that it would be extremely difficult to specify
the details of record keeping by law. In many experiments in
genetics and.medicine the animals are not identified individually,
but only by so many of each of several classes. To require an
accounting of each individual would add tremendously to the labor and
eXpense.

6) Student work should be as painless as possible to the
animals involved. Many experiments could be and are performed under
anesthetics. Many types of doctoral studies in biology and medicine
require operations on live animals. It would be highly undesirable
to restrict unduly such operations or to prevent students from
performing them.

7) It is perhaps desirable to include all vertebrates within
the scope of the pnoposed act, but it must be recognized that not all
types of vertebrates are concerned in laboratory experiments in the
same way. Fish and frogs, for examples, require very different
quarters and treabnent than dogs or cats. The inoculatimn of horses
or other animals to obtain antisera undoubtedly produces some degree of
pain. The question.might even arise whether the inoculation of
chick embryoes with disease organisms may not produce pain in the
embryo. Again, I think it impossible to include all these specifications
in any law.

8) Failure to comply with the rules established by the Secretary
should be consider d a breach of contract and fUrther payments on the
grant in question should be suspended. This udll in nearly all cases
be sufficient punishment, especially if publicity is given to the
case.

I suggest, therefore, the following type of bill. The wording
will of course have to be different. I do not have a copy of
H.R.l937 at hand. I am just trying to give the general nature of
my thinking:

a) The statement of basic objectives should.be expanded to
include research on the basic principles of biology, in addition
to medical and.military implications and applications. Emphasis
should be that laboratory research cannot be most effective unless
the experimental animals are maintained in the best possible health
and comfo rt.

b) Authorization might be repeated that government agencies may
make grants to provide adequate quarters for experimental animals,
either by new construction or by modification of existing facilities.

c) The Secretary of Health, Education andeelfare should be
instructed to prepare and publish appropriate regulations for the
care of laboratory animals and for thee! experiments on living animals
under any federal grant, to the end that the studies and experiments

 




‘oe conducted in a humane manner, painlessly insofar as may be

possible, and.with a minimum of discomfort to the animals concerned.

He should require the keeping of such records as.may oe needed to ensure
conformity to these rules.

d) The Secretary or his agents should.be empowered to inspect
at any'thne records, laboratories, or animal quarters used in whole
or inn o_art for an3 studies supported by federal funds.

the support in an ’ iological laboratories or animal quarters

should be held responsible for ensuring that any associated investigator
or advanced student using these facilities confonms to t_1e rules
established by the Secretary for the humane treatment of laboratory
animals.

e) The Princ P?§§1b Investigator under each federal grant involving

f) Failure to confonn to the ru es published by the Secretary
by any person working in any laboratory or animal quarters supported
in part under a federal grant shall constitute a breach of contract
and shall terminate further research support under that grant.

I think that a lav of somewhat the type I here suggest would
have good chance for passage. t would I believe be supported or at
least not be objected to by most biologists. The law as now
prOposed in H.R.l937 will be violently opposed by most biologists,
including those who are most humane in their operations. I suspect
that even if passed, it would do more harm than good. I cannot

myself support it without very serious changes.

I have been most brutally frank. Please forgive me.

Sincerely,

ﬁe QB“;

1 The question of sale of “sur-'
plus” animals from the Sagi
naw Animal Shelter apparent-
ly will wind up once more in
the hands of the Board of
Supervisors. The dogs and cats
would be sold for experiment-
al purposes.

The County Animal Control
Commission last night made no
recommendations, but t h e r e
was sentiment in favor of the
sale. The commission tabled
action until its next meeting
so that it can obtain the advice
of its two veterinarian mem-
bers. Dr. Thomas I. Millerick
was out of town and could not
attend last night’s meeting, and
Dr. Harry L. Cole had to leave
early because of another ap
pointment.

The offer was made by
Edward S. Rogers of Rich-
mond, Mich., who buys dogs
and cats from county dogr
pounds and sells them to
medical and veterinary
schools and laboratories.

Rogers told the commission
he would buy all dogs weigh-
ing 15 pounds or more for
$1.50. ,each and all cats for 50
cents each. He said he was not
interested in dogs under 15
pounds.

In his initial offer last Feb-
r11ary Rogers offered $1 each
fOr the dogs.

Stuart G- Walz, commission

 

member and former chairman,|
urged that if the sale is ap-
proved Rogers be prohibited
.' from selling. the animals for
.vvivisection purposes.

dWalz said the commission
‘jtsho‘uld recommend the sale
.- only if the animals are sold to
veterinary and medical schools
. . i? ,irissctional purposes.

 

 

Jr. ; his .. “4m Genny

 

Board of Supervisors, which
must take final action.

Commission Member Mrs.
Rose Morris, who is presi-
dent of the Saginaw County

Humane Society, objected to
the sale and threatened to
consult an attorney about
means of blocking it.

At least on commission
member urged the sale, with-
out reservations, but he later.
went along with Walz’s no-
vivisection motion.

The unclaimed dogs and
cats at the dog pound are at
the present time killed and
given to a chemical company.

Rogers said he already is
trading with the dog pounds in
Macomb, and Lapeer Counties.
He had appeared at an April 1'
meeting of the commission .
but no action was taken ati
that time. ‘

Rogers had been invited to
appear before the Board of
Supervisors C o u n t y Affairs
and Agriculture Committee in
March, but missed it because
of a misunderstanding abou
the location of the meeting.

 

His offer has brought pro
tests from, the Humane Society
and others who .have com
plained of the County “sellin
dogs wholesale to mak.

money.” w,»

 

 

 

 

[Sale Of 'Surplus’AnimoIs
Headed For Supervisors

There is at least one p053
sible legal barrier to the f
transaction. The County Ani- :
mal Shelter was constructed ‘
with money from the estate :
‘of the late Frank A. Rock-
well, who left a trust fund
lor‘ the care of homeless
animals.

The sale could be consid-
ered a violation of the trust
fund agreement. If so, the
trust donation could be discon-
tinued.

Another barrier is a Board
of Supervisors resolution that
sets the price of dogs bought
from the pound at a minimum:
of $5. This resolution would
have to be rescinded.

(Actually, because of charges
for licenses and rabies shots
it costs about $10 to buy a dog}
from the dog pound.) 1

Mapping the To rmenied Brain

By Earl Ubell

Science Editor

Just about ten years ago, a young man working in a
psychological laboratory at ,McGill University in Montreal
discovered a remarkable. property of a rat’s brain.- It was...

, so startling that many mature scientists at first refused"

to believe the findings.

_ The young man, Dr. James Olds, now professor of
psychology at the University of Michigan, found what has
been called a “pleasure center” or a “rewarding center”
deep in the rodent’s brain. It took a clever and unex-
pected technique to uncover it.

By last week, there was‘new evidence that we human
~.\ beings also have such “pleasure” centers, and as in the
,-' rat, they seem to be scattered in various parts of the
"i, brain. How do we know? Three Tulane University scien-
tists had tried Dr. Old's rat-type experiement on .a human

‘ being

3. To do it, the Tulane scientists ran wires into the
Lbrain of a mental patient and shocked the deep part of his
t train with small currents of electricty just as Dr. Olds
h {ad done to his rats, and others have since done to cats,

nnonkeys, goldfish, guinea pigs, dogs, goats and the bottle- ‘

n iose dolphin.

’3 Mapping the Brain

1 .

i Out of this seeming gruesome job of tickling the brain
wi th electricity, the scientists hope to get a map of the
intricate windings of nerves, their function and how they
ma ke us feel happY. sad, part of the world or disconnected

‘ fro h it. At the end of the line, they see the possibility of

him ing the tormented brains of the mental disease victims.

Before Dr. Olds' experiments, scientists had used
elec: [jical stimulation of animal brains. Sometimes muscles
twitched, eyes rolled and epileptic seizures occured. But
when they put electrodes deep into the brain, stimulation

broug , no‘ specific response. Were these regions of no“ ,

impo cc?
Dr. Olds was initially interested in the overall effect

~ of brain stimulation, so he implanted the electrodes in a

rat’s skull. Then he would shoot an electric current into
the skull when the rat stood in the corner of a laige square
table. He had hoped that the rat would move away from
the corner. To his surprise the animal 1eturned again
and again to the corner as if it liked what happened there.
Soon Dr. Olds discovered that he could “steer” the animal
in whatever direction he wanted simply by stimulating the

brain when the animal moved slightly in the desired di-
rection.

Liked Sensation

Dr. Olds and his associates wanted to know just how
rewarding or pleasureable the jolt to the brain might
be. Since he couldn’t ask the animal, he rigged up a
system by which the animal‘could control its own shocks
by pressing a lever. If the animal wanted another shock
it could press again. Some animals pressed the levers as
many as 3000 times an hour,‘ more than once a second.

Others enjoyed the sensations so much that they pre-
ferred to press the lever than eat or drink. They would

, endure painful shocks to the feet rather than give up the

electricity in the head.

Other scientists experimenting on other species ob—
tained similar results, except that they found that the
pleasure “centers” often had a width of less than a
hundreth of an inch. In a sense, Dr. Olds was lucky to
have star-ted on the rat where the rewarding center is
relatively easy to find.

But soon the scientists discovered “punishing” or
“aversion” centers in the brain. Electric stimulation to
those regions will cause the animal to avoid the stimula-
tion. One set-up required the animal to push the lever to
avoid the “punishing” stimulation, and push it he did.

Test Mental Cases

Of course, there was every reason to believe that man
had the same endowments, but who wanted to be the

4 test animal? About the same time that Dr. Olds worked on

his rats, Dr. Robeit G. Heath, of Tulane University Medical
School drove electrodes deep into the brains of mental
patients. Knowing that electric shock therapy sometimes

” helps these patients, Dr Heath felt that if he could pin-

"point the shocks, he might get a better result, and; he did
report improvements. However, he did not explicitly recog-
nize any pleasure centers.

In the meantime,”Dr._ Jose Delgado, of ' Yale, and Dr.
C. W. Sem-JaCOb’sen, 'of SWed-en,‘ also put-electrodes deep
into the brains: of human beings and pumped in small

.amounts of electricity. -.Dr Sem-Jacobsen reported that his .
patients had feelings of pleasure Dr. Delgado said his.

"patients began to giggle, they. talked three to four times
as much as when the current was turned off, and they
expressed sexual thoughts.

Dr. Heath wanted to know if the Olds experiments,

could be done in human beings. So he and two colleagues
set up a patient with a-lever and electrodes in the brain.

This patient had been severely mentally ill since childhood; .

and had withdrawn from the real world. As in animals,

the patient pressed the lever to get the electricity when it *

was “rewarding” and pressed it to avoid electricity when
it was “punishing. ” "

Where all this will lead cannot be predicted at this

time. Dr. Olds believes that it tells us something about 11on

we think and how our emotions arise. He" thinks that the

pleasure centers arose from that‘part 'of the brain used in

the sense of smell whichwere large in our animal‘lforebears
but which have become part of our deep brains. The punish-
ment centers arose from our spinal cord and sense of touch.
Together these centers act in balance to keep us within a
narrow 1ange of somally acceptable behavior.

_ To the psychiatrists, the deep brain work means a way"
of attacking one of society’s most serious problems: me ntal

illness. By knowing how a brain works, they think they
may be able to contiol its aberrations.

Dear . Miss Fana:

This is in reply to your recent letter to Secretary Celebrezze, in
which you express your support of pending legislation concerning the
humane treatment of research animals.

At the present time, seven bills have been introduced in the Congress
dealing in different ways with the problem of humane treatment of
animals used for research and testing purposes. Several of these bills,
including H.R. 8077 which is identical to H.R. 4856, have been referred
by Congressional Committees to the Department for its consideration and
opinion. The Department is presently considering the many difficult
questions of public policy involved in this legislation, including the
relationship between the Federal Government and nonfederal institutions,
both State and private.

The Department and its constituent agency, the Public Health Service,
want you to be assured that they share your objective that animals
involved in research for whatever purpose should receive humane treat-
ment and should be maintained under wholesome conditions. Great
efforts are made in the conduct of research activities to assure such
treatment of research animals. Similar effort is made to develop

sound and humane practices in the treatment of animals used in research
being supported through grant programs. These efforts are expended in
the realization that humane treatment of laboratory animals is not only
a moral responsibility but also an indispensable component of high
quality medical research.

Sincerely,

NOTE ON CONDITIONED REINFORCEMENT IN AVOIDANCE EXTINCTION

DONALD H. BULLOCK
INSTITUTE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL

An adult male albino rat was given an extinction session of approximately 6 hours, after a
history of extensive avoidance conditioning in a Sidman-type situation involving an escape
contingency, a shock intensity of 2.0 milliamperes (at the source, an Applegate D.C.
stimulator), and R-S and 8-8 intervals equal to 20 seconds. After about 3 hours, the re-
sponse rate had reached zero and the rat had emitted approximately 930 responses. At this
point, a conditioned negative reinforcing stimulus was introduced. This S-r consisted of a
pulsing counter which was activated at a rate of l per second. This pulsing counter had been
operative in the previous avoidance sessions whenever the rat allowed the shock circuit to
come on, and had been used to evaluate escape—behavior latency. During the ﬁnal 3 hours of
the extinction session, this pulsing counter was activated via the shock-administration
circuit and was terminated by lever pressing. Introduction of the sound of the pulsing
counter, which was clearly audible to the rat, resulted in a second extinction curve of about
880 responses. Thus, a stimulus correlated with shock administrations in a Sidman-type
avoidance involving an escape contingency can probably exert considerable control over
responding.

Figure 1 presents the cumulative-response curves for the entire session. The pulsing
counter was introduced at the arrow, and was present whenever the pen was downset. It
should be noted that the rat did not receive a single shock throughout the session. The
“warm-up” effect often noted in relation to avoidance behavior was apparent, despite the
absence of shocks.

NOTE ON KEY-HOLDING BEHAVIOR IN THE PIGEON
DONALD H. BULLOCK
INSTITUTE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL

Three pigeons, all with several years of experimental history under conditions of food-
_reinforced key pecking (multiple schedules, electric-shock punishment), evidenced a “sus-
picious” decline in rate during repeated 1—hour sessions of F1 26 seconds. Monitoring of
their performances indicated that this decline was associated with key-holding behavior: as
the moment of reinforcement approached, the likelihood and duration of key holding in—
creased. A possible source of the difﬁculty was that the programmer being used did not in-
clude a pulse former in conjunction with the primary response circuit. Therefore, a pulse
former was installed, with the result that all three pigeons showed increased rates. The effect
was not due to any change in the audio-visual feedback from the response, and monitoring
of the performances indicated that key holding had been eliminated.

Figure 1 presents the cumulative-response curves for one of the pigeons during 16 ses-
sions. The pulse former was introduced at the arrow, Session N.

DECREMENT IN PERFORMANCE DURING PROLONGED
AVOIDANCE SESSIONS

JOHN J. BOREN

MERCK INSTITUTE FOR THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH
WEST POINT, PENNSYLVANIA

The purpose ofthis experiment was to study some effects of forcing an animal to make a
simple operant response over extremely long periods of time. The experiment may be con-
sidered within the general context of fatigue or sleep deprivation. In order to maintain
responding, an avoidance technique was used. The selection was made for several reasons:
ﬁrst, the avoidance procedure generally produces a number of responses per minute so that
the animal has little opportunity for rest; second, a failure to respond results in an aversive
stimulus which awakens a' sleepy animal and reinstates responding; and third, avoidance
behavior is not subject to satiation effects which are difficult to control during long expo-
sures to positive—reinforcement schedules. The consequences of the extended period of
responding were evaluated from the avoidance behavior in terms of response rate and shock
frequency. In addition, a ﬁxed-interval schedule of reinforcement was occasionally intro-
duced into the procedure, and thus allowed measurement not only of the response rate but
also of the temporal discrimination which typiﬁes this schedule.

SUBJECTS AND APPARATUS

The subjects were two male Rhesus monkeys. Under the deprivation procedure used, one
monkey (L) weighed approximately 8 kilograms while the other (V) weighed about 3 kilo-
grams. The past history of both monkeys was composed of lengthy training (more than
1500 hours) on a multiple schedule with avoidance, SA, and ﬁxed-interval components.

The experimental chamber was a metal box, 2 feet in each dimension, containing a micro-
switch lever and a motor-driven dipper. The bottom and one side of the chamber were
formed ofgrids. ~

An electric shock could be delivered to the animal through the grids by means of a
scrambler which randomly reversed the polarity of the voltage on the grids. The motor-
driven dipper presented about 0.75 milliliter of condensed milk through a small opening.
The procedure was programmed automatically by a system of relays and timers, while the
lever-pressing behavior was recorded on magnetic counters and a cumulative recorder.

PROCEDURE
Preliminary Studies

Pilot experiments were run in which the monkeys were kept mainly on the avoidance
procedure for sessions of moderate durations. Sessions of 3 and 5 days were ﬁrst tried. In
view ofthese experiments, which showed that the monkeys could tolerate the long sessions
without great difﬁculty, the week-long sessions described below were tried. The data
gathered in the shorter pilot experiments were consistent with those reported below for the
week-long sessions.

The monkeys were maintained on a feeding regime of one meal every 2 days. The meal
consisted of one and a half oranges, half a head of lettuce, and an excess of Purina monkey
chow pellets. Left-over food was removed after an eating period of 2.5 hours.

The procedure during the experimental sessions consisted of a multiple schedule with two
components, free-operant avoidance (Sidman, 1953) and a ﬁxed-interval schedule of rein-
forcement (Ferster & Skinner, 1957). During the avoidance procedure, a 5-milliampere
shock was delivered every 20 seconds in the event the animal did not press the lever
(shock-shock interval equals 20 seconds); each lever press postponed the shock for
20 seconds (response-shock interval equals 20 seconds). During the avoidance procedure,
an auditory clicker was presented through a loud-speaker in the chamber. In the absence
of any auditory stimuli, a 5-minute, ﬁxed-interval (FI) schedule of reinforcement was
programmed: the ﬁrst response after 5 minutes was reinforced with the presentation of a
dipper of condensed milk for 5 seconds.

During the prolonged sessions, the basic aim of the experiment was to keep the animal
responding predominantly on the avoidance procedure for 7 days. Avoidance was inter—
rupted only for a feedlng period every 2 days or for occasional daily tests of F1 behavior.
The details of each daily schedule were as follows. A monkey was put into the chamber on a
Friday afternoon at about 4:00 pm. having been fed the previous day. Three to six FI’s were
run off, after which the avoidance procedure was turned on until 9:00 am. Saturday morn-
ing. Then, for about 2.5 hours, the procedure was changed to an alternation of three
F 1’s and 15 minutes of avoidance. A shifting limited-hold procedure was used with the FI
schedule so that a failure to respond after 5 minutes would cut short the F I component and
produce the avoidance component again. To facilitate getting at least a partial sample of F1
behavior, the limited hold on the ﬁrst F1 was 45 seconds; on the second, it was 30 seconds;
and on the third, 15 seconds. In this way the animal was prevented from taking a long
rest during the FI periods. After about 2.5 hours of alternating avoidance and F1, the
SA (a tone) was turned on, and the daily ration was put in the experimental chamber. As
soon as the animal was observed to have stopped eating (usually after an hour or so), the
surplus food was removed and the avoidance procedure was reinstated. At 8:00 am. Mon-
day, the alternating FI avoidance procedure was instituted for 4 hours, the animal was fed,
and avoidance was run for 2 hours; then, the alternating FI avoidance was run for about
1 hour until 4:00 pm, when the straight avoidance was allowed to remain on until 8:00 am.
the next day. The programs for Wednesday and Friday were the same as those for Monday.
The programs for Tuesday and Thursday were the same as those for Monday, except that
an avoidance period replaced the feeding period.

Following a session, the monkey was given a week of rest with normal rations in the home
cage in order to minimize carry-over effects from one session to the next. Each monkey
participated in three of the prolonged sessions as described above over a 6-week period. Due
to technical difﬁculties, however, the data for one session for Monkey V were discarded.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The average rate of avoidance responding (in lever presses per minute) and the shock
frequency (in shocks per 10 minutes) were calculated for each day and night of the experi-
ment, with the exception that one average rate was calculated for the continuous-avoidance
period from Saturday noon to Monday morning. The average rates during the ﬁxed-interval
schedule were also measured for the appropriate days.

Figures 1 and 2 show how the above measures changed during the week-long session. The
average of three sessions for Monkey L are described in Fig. 1, while the average of two
sessions for Monkey V are in Fig. 2. A generalization can be made about all sessions for

both monkeys: as the sessions progressed, the avoidance rate decreased and the shock fre-
quency increased. After the fourth day, the avoidance behavior at night differed systemati-
cally from that in the day; thus, the curves for avoidance rate and shock frequency assumed
a systematic zig-zag appearance. The most likely possibility is that the day-night diﬂ‘erence
represents a typical diurnal cycle; however, the insertion of the fixed—interval schedule and
the feeding period during the day might have contributed to the dilTerence. The avoidance
rate and the shock frequency returned to their normal values at the beginning of each ses-
sion after the animals had been in their home cage for a week.

The ﬁxed—interval rate also declined through the session except for a small rise toward the
end ofthe session. This slight rise, which occurred in four of the ﬁve sessions studied, may
represent an increase in “drive.” That is, a long avoidance session which requires sustained
performance may produce changes in food—reinforced behavior similar to food-deprivation
operations. In support ofthis interpretation was the fact that the animals lost weight during
the extended session.

A more speciﬁc picture of changes in avoidance behavior may be seen in Fig. 3. Samples
of Monkey V’s cumulative record of Session 134 were selected from the ﬁrst, the fourth,
and the seventh nights. The record for the ﬁrst night shows the rested monkey putting out a
relatively high steady rate and taking few shocks. By the fourth night, however, the average
rate is lower, the shocks are more frequent, and a cyclical pattern emerges. The rate slows
gradually to the point where a shock is delivered. After the shock, the rate increases
abruptly and then slows again to start another cycle. It is attractive to consider the cyclical
pattern as a behavioral picture of “dozing.” By the seventh night, the rate is quite low and
the number of shocks is extremely high.

In Fig. 4, a picture of the ﬁxed-interval behavior is shown at various days during the ses-
sion. Since the ﬁxed-interval behavior varied considerably, the records selected for this
ﬁgure are not representative of all patterns which appeared during the session. In general,
however, remarkably few changes occurred.

Disruption of the characteristic ﬁxed-interval scallop was not observed, even at the end of
the session. The lack of a major change in this study is consistent with the ﬁnding of Skinner
and Morse (1958), who kept pigeons responding over long periods by a DRL schedule. The
only clear change in the FI seemed to be in the frequency of “ﬂat” scallops; that is, as the
session progressed, scallops with only one response or even no response (where the limited-
hold procedure terminated the FI) occurred more frequently.

Figure 4 also illustrates another point. At all times during the session, the animal’s
ability to discriminate between the stimuli for avoidance and ﬁxed interval was unimpaired.
It might be expected that the avoidance rate of a sleepy animal would run through into the
ﬁrst minutes of the next ﬁxed interval. However, as may be seen in Fig. 4, when the stimuli
changed from avoidance to ﬁxed interval, the monkey stopped responding immediately.

Observation of the animals during the extended session revealed several points of inter—
est: 1) a monkey can appear to be asleep (eyes closed, hunched into the typical sleep posture)
and still maintain a steady rate of avoidance responding; 2) monkeys appear to catch quick
“naps” and then “awaken” to make lever-pressing responses. For example, in the ﬁrst
seconds after an avoidance response, the animal might assume the sleep posture; then, the
animal would abruptly “awaken” and make an avoidance response. A similar observation
was often made during the ﬁrst minutes of the ﬁxed-interval schedule. If a technique could
be found which would eliminate these quick “naps,” it is possible that decrements in
performance would be observed in considerably less than 4-5 days.

SUMMARY

Two monkeys, previously trained to lever press on a multiple schedule of avoidance and
ﬁxed-interval reinforcement, were subjects in an experiment to determine the decrement in

 




206 JOHN J. BOREN

performance generated by a prolonged session. The monkeys were kept predominantly on a
Sidman avoidance procedure for 7 days, during which they were required to respond at
least once every 20 seconds. Changes in performance occurred slowly and gradually, but
after 4 days rather clear effects could be seen. The rate of avoidance responding decreased
and the number of shocks increased sharply. The ﬁxed-interval rate tended to decrease,
although in some cases a small increase was observed late in the session. The temporal
pattern of the FI scallop was not disrupted by the long session, although small “ﬂat”
scallops occurred more frequently. The animals’ stimulus discriminations were unimpaired.

OPERANT DISCRIMINATION REVERSALS: COMPARATIVE DATA

W. A. DETERLINE

ALMA COLLEGE'

Speed of “problem solving” and the rate of development of a single discrimination have
generally been unsatisfactory dependent variables in comparative studies of learning,
primarily because any obtained differences might possibly be attributed to artifacts such as
differences in sensory capacity or response repertoires. Progressive changes in the rate of de-
velopment of a discriminative response over extended series of SD and SA manipulations,
on the other hand, are extremely useful in inter-species studies of what Harlow (1949) has
labeled “the formation oflearning sets.” Successive discrimination problems, discrimination
reversals, and successive acquisitions and extinctions have provided data of this sort. Under
all three ofthese procedures, subjects show a progressive decline in the number, percentage,
or rate of unreinforced responses. Species differences have been reported in the rate at which
unreinforced responses decline under these conditions, although the same general trends
have typically appeared.

Wodinsky and Bitterman (1957) have tentatively identiﬁed species differences during re-
versal learning in ﬁsh and rats, the same species used in the present study. Although these
investigators are unwilling to conclude that their data have unequivocally isolated a species
difference, the present ﬁndings are in agreement with theirs.

Most of the “learning set” studies, and related experiments dealing with discrimination
reversals and successive acquisitions and extinctions, have made use of discrete trials and
simultaneous presentations of SD and 8-“. This report is based on a comparative study of dis-
crimination reversals in the ﬁsh and the rat in a free-operant procedure using successive
presentation of SD and SA conditions.—

METHOD

Subjects

The subjects were one mature, male African mouthbreeder (Tilapia macrocephala), about
4 inches long, and a male albino rat, Sprague-Dawley strain, about 120 days old. The ﬁsh
was maintained on a 23-hour, food-deprivation schedule, and the rat on a 23-hour, water-
deprivation schedule. Both subjects had completed a series of successive acquisitions and
extinctions on the day prior to the ﬁrst day of discrimination training (reported in Deter-
line 1957, 1960).

Apparatus

The ﬁsh apparatus has been described previously (Deterline, 1956). A wooden platform,
with a food magazine mounted on its top surface, ﬁt snugly over the standard 5-gallon ﬁsh
tank that housed the subject. A lever-arm was suspended down into the tank to a point ap-
proximately 1 inch below the surface of the water. The ﬁsh activated the food magazine by
moving horizontally against the wedge-shaped target on the end of the lever-arm. The food
magazine dropped powdered food onto the surface of the water inside a ﬂoating glass ring

‘The ﬁsh data were collected at the University of Pittsburgh, and are reported in Deterline (1957). The rat data
were collected at Alma College.

that was fastened to one end of the tank. The distance from the target to the ring was
approximately 2 inches. Each response to the lever activated the stepper of a cumulative
recorder, and each operation of the food magazine produced a diagonal pip below the
cumulative curve. The closing of the food-magazine solenoid produced a vibratory SD for
the food-approach response.

A DRL programmer with a 30-second nonresponse criterion controlled the magazine
circuit and two sources of illumination. The two discriminative stimuli were a bright light
(169 foot-candles at the surface of the water) and a dim light (2.4 foot-candles).

The rat apparatus was a 9.125-inch-by 8.625-inch-by 8-inch lever box (Scientiﬁc Proto-
type Co., Model 101), with water reinforcement provided by a syringe pump (Lon R. Davis
Model LR—130). The stainless-steel lever required a movement of 5 millimeters to operate
the control circuits. Two illumination levels (provided by either a shielded 3—watt bulb or
an unshielded 6-watt bulb) were used in the rat apparatus. A relay mounted in parallel with
the water reinforcer provided the SD for the cup-approach response. A DRL programmer,
identical in function to that used with the ﬁsh, was added to the circuitry. A cumulative
recorder produced equivalent data for the rat.

The DRL programmer presented the SD illumination until a single response was made.
Food reinforcement was given and the programmer reset to the beginning of its 30—second
cycle. The resetting of the programmer also changed the illumination from SD to SA. Each
SA response reset the programmer, and SD was withheld until the 30-second criterion of non-
responding had been met. The discrimination was reversed simply by reversing the illumina-
tion relationships to SD and SA conditions.

Procedure

Both subjects had completed a series of 15 days of successive acquisitions and extinctions
prior to the ﬁrst day of discrimination learning. The ﬁrst discrimination consisted of ﬁve
1-hour experimental sessions 24 hours apart. During the ﬁrst discrimination the brighter
light was the SD and the dimmer light the SA. The ﬁrst reversal consisted of three daily
sessions, and each of the four subsequent reversals covered two daily periods. Each experi—
mental session began with the SD present, and the 1-hour period began with the ﬁrst
response.

RESULTS

Both of the subjects, to some extent, showed the usual pattern of reversal learning. The
typical reversal data show negative transfer between reversals, with improvement within re-
versals and over the entire series. Figure 1 shows that the ﬁsh was still showing a decline in
number of SA responses on the ﬁfth reversal, while the rat had apparently reached its maxi-
mum elﬁciency by the end of the ﬁrst reversal. The use of a response criterion during each SA
period would be expected to produce a high terminal level of reversal efﬁciency (Dufort,
Guttman, & Kimble, 1954); but the difference between the subjects in rate of approaching
this terminal level was quite striking. The ﬁsh and rat also differed in relative amounts of
negative transfer on the ﬁrst reversal, with the rat making about the same number of SA re-
sponses as it had on the third day of the original discrimination. The ﬁsh, however, made
over 300% more SA responses on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁrst reversal than it had made during
any one ofthe original discrimination sessions. Even on the ﬁrst day ofthe ﬁfth reversal, the

ﬁsh was responding during SA about as frequently as it had on the ﬁrst 2 days of the original
discrimination.2

The same differences may be seen in another form in the cumulative curves for both sub-
jects (Fig. 2 and 3). The curves for the rat, except for the original discrimination and the
ﬁrst day of the ﬁrst reversal, are essentially parallel, with only ephemeral local effects ap-
pearing during the ﬁrst 5 or 10 minutes of each daily curve. The curves for the ﬁsh are not
parallel, although the trend in that direction is apparent.

The use of the 30-second criterion of nonresponding during each SA period prevented any
SA response from being followed immediately by the SD and a reinforced response. This per-
mitted another stimulus component, the illumination change, to gain considerable stimulus

2The ﬁrst point on each of the graphs in Fig. 1 does not actually represent the performance of these two subjects,
but represents the average performance under similar conditions for other subjects of the same species. This sub-
stitution was made necessary by the temporary rate suppression shown by these two subjects on the ﬁrst day of
discrimination, a suppression that resulted from the previous experience with successive acquisitions and extinc-
tions. The substitute points were added here only to indicate the general form of the original discrimination curve.
For this same reason the cumulative curve for the ﬁrst day of the original discrimination does not appear in either
Fig. 2 or Fig. 3.

control over the response. The relative absence of negative transfer on the later reversals for
the rat suggested that the change, regardless of its direction, had replaced any absolute—
intensity characteristics as the functional SD. During SA periods, absence of change had
always immediately preceded any unreinforced responses that occurred, while low-latency
responses to the light SD were also low-latency responses to the change itself.

To test the effectiveness of illumination change as the functional SD, a third light, inter-
mediate in intensity to the other two, was added to the apparatus. The three lights were
operated manually by E rather than by the programmer, in the order of presentation shown
in Table 1. Light 1, the brightest of the three, was turned on ﬁrst, with the programmer
(which still controlled the reinforcer circuit and the 30-second SA criterion) set at SD.
When the ﬁrst response was made and reinforced, Light 1 was turned off and Light 2 turned
on. At the end of the SA period, 2 was turned off and 3 was turned on until one response was

 




OPERANT DISCRIMINATION REVERSALS 251

made and reinforced, and so on. Each of these illumination changes was correlated with the
change in conditions controlled by the programmer. Each stimulus was presented twice in
each series of six illumination changes, once as SD and once as SA. In this way, no in-
tensity was consistently correlated with either the SD or SA conditions. Figure 4 shows the
cumulative curve produced by the subject. Here, the change, rather than the absolute in-
tensities, was an effective SD. The subject left the lever area after about 50 minutes and did
not return during the remainder of the hour. It should be noted that responding could not
have been based on a time discrimination because the SA period was lengthened by each SA
response, and because the programmer had a built-in reset error that occasionally—about
one reset in lZ—terminated the SA period in less than 30 seconds.

DISCUSSION

The form of the curves (Fig. 1) reported here are typical of data collected on other sub-
jects of the same species, and the course of reversal learning suggests a real species differ-
ence, although this difference cannot be identiﬁed as being qualitative rather than quantita—
tive. The rat apparently was responding to the illumination change, independent of direction
of change, by the end of the ﬁrst reversal, while the absolute intensities continued to control
the response of the ﬁsh through the ﬁfth reversal. The ﬁsh had been discarded before the rat

data were collected, so that reversals in the ﬁsh could not be continued to asymptote, nor
could change discrimination be tested using the multiple-stimulus procedure.

The notion that a modiﬁcation in the functional SD occurs during successive discrimina-
tions or discrimination reversals is the basis for Restle’s (1958) analysis of learning sets,
and these data support that view. Of course, the ability of the rat to respond efﬁciently to
stimulus changes (Fig. 4) cannot be called either a necessary or sufﬁcient condition to pro-
duce the type of reversal curve produced by the rat (Fig. l).

The behavior of the ﬁsh during SA periods should have facilitated the development of the
illumination change as a powerful 3”. After consuming the reinforcement presented for the
response to SD, the ﬁsh moved directly to the target and remained motionless, except for
positioning movements of the pectoral ﬁns, a fraction of an inch from the target. The change
to SD was followed by a response, usually with a latency of less than 1 second. Additional
data, over more reversals, should be collected for the ﬁsh, and the operant-discrimination
reversal procedure should be more systematically investigated with a wider range of sub-
jects. The relationship between simultaneous and successive presentations of SD and SA is
far from clear in the discrete trials procedure, and the use of a free-operant procedure might
shed light on that problem.

OPERANT DISCRIMINATION REVERSALS

SUMMARY

Both a ﬁsh and a rat, given a series of ﬁve operant-discrimination reversals, showed a
progressive decline in the number of SA responses on successive reversals. The rat reached
its maximum level of efﬁciency by the third reversal, while the ﬁsh showed a much more
gradual change which was not yet complete by the ﬁfth reversal. The rat was shown to have
been responding effectively to the stimulus change, independently of the absolute intensity?
ofthe change. 5

EXPERIMENTAL FLEXIBILITY
L. R. GOLLUB
HARVARD UNIVERSITY

This note describes a convenient, economical, and safe way to program several similar ex—
perimental procedures with a single relay rack for one box. Although toggle switches can be
set to select different programs, two programs is the limit for a single switch; and with more
than one switch, the technician’s errors become more frequent. Also, since most switches
are double—pole, changing more than two circuits requires that the switch control relays, an
unproductive use for high-quality switching equipment.

We are now using multiposition, multilevel, rotary selector switches (e.g., Centralab),
which are mounted on bakelite panels, with all poles and commons connected to Nu-way
snap studs. The switch has a different position for each subject, even when two subjects run
under identical procedures. Thus, the technician must move the switch regularly before
starting each session. Circuits are then wired through these switches. For example, one pole
might control the value of F1 which is programmed; another, the duration of food-magazine
presentation; and a third, whether or not a time out follows reinforcement.

With these switches, procedural errors are nearly eliminated, and programs are often
easier to change. Finally, these devices encourage running more experimental procedures in
each station, thus increasing the yield of a given equipment investment.

Apparatus Editor Note: We have been using a similar technique, and can conﬁrm that errors
are reduced and ﬂexilibity is increased. We use a single rotary switch to operate relays which
adjust the treatment of several different animal boxes whose experimental periods coincide.
The JBT rotary switches (described in Radio-Electronic Master) can be obtained fully en-
closed and protected from dust.

SOME RELATIONS BETWEEN THE AUDITORY SYSTEM OF THE
MEDULLA AND AUDITORY-STIMULUS FUNCTIONS‘

J. M. HARRISON, R. M. ABELSON, and G. L. FISHER
BOSTON UNIVERSITY

One approach to the relation between the nervous system and behavior is to consider the
data of neuroanatomy as a series of independent variables, some of which may exert control
over behavior. Such an approach requires the manipulation of the nervous system in a
(neuroanatomically) known way in animals in which a large number of behavioral processes
have been investigated. Since no one knows in advance what behavioral processes will be
signiﬁcant with respect to a given neural structure, the initial discovery of any empirical re-
lations is largely a matter of luck. In this respect, one faces the same problems in the study
ofthe effects exerted upon behavior by a particular drug.

It might be mentioned here that the foregoing approach is the opposite of that which
seeks to determine the neural bases of a behavioral process, such as, for example, the neural
basis of reinforcement.

The experiments reported here were carried out within this framework, and were con—
cerned with the relation between some second- and third-order auditory pathways of the
medulla and some functions of auditory stimuli. The effects of lesions of the auditory path-
ways on a variety of auditory- and visual-stimulus functions were examined in an effort to
determine whether or not such lesions would differentially affect these stimulus functions.

In a second series of experiments the attempt was made at a preliminary analysis of the
behavioral effects ofthe lesions by a method described by Dews (1956). In the present case
the analysis consisted of the attempted reproduction of the behavioral effects of the lesions
by the manipulation ofthe external environmental variables which control that behavior in
the normal animal.

METHOD

Subjects and Behavioral Procedures

Eighteen male albino rats, Sprague-Dawley strain, were used in these experiments.

The animals were run on one or more ofthe following schedules. ,.

(1) Noise termination (Keller). An intense noise (109 to 124 decibels) was continuously \
on unless terminated for 10 seconds by a lever press (Rp). Responses during the lO-second
silent period were without effect.

(2) Termination—onset (Hefferline). This schedule was run with an intense noise
(109 to 124 decibels) as the reinforcing stimulus. A depression of the lever (Rp) terminated
the noise, and a release ofthe lever (RR) produced the noise.

(3) Termination-onset. Same as the above schedule but with an intense light (200 foot
lamberts) in place of the intense noise.

Details of the behavior generated by these schedules have been published elsewhere
(Harrison & Abelson, 1959; Hefferline, 1950; Keller, 1941).

(4) Two~lever chain VI 1 CRF (limited hold). Responding on the ﬁrst lever, L 1, pro-
duced either a low-intensity noise or a dim light, both of which were positive discriminative
stimuli for responding on the second lever, L 2. A response on L 2 in the presence of the

placed on the discriminative stimuli; and, in addition, responding on L 2 in the absence of
the stimuli prolonged the VI interval on the ﬁrst lever by 10 seconds. The sound and light
stimuli alternated in an irregular manner on a variable-interval schedule of 2 minutes.

To allow the auditory-intensity threshold to be measured, this schedule was modiﬁed as
follows. Each occurrence of the response in the presence of noise lowered the intensity of
the next presentation of the noise by 2 decibels. Each occurrence of the noise that was
missed was followed by an increase in intensity of 2 decibels of the next presentation. The
threshold was deﬁned as that intensity value of the stimulus that occurred most frequently.

Apparatus

For the aversive schedules the apparatus consisted of a light-tight and relatively sound-
proof enclosure containing a restraining cage. Mounted in one wall of the restraining cage
was a Gerbrands rat lever. Mounted over the cage was a tweeter loud-speaker for the de-
livery of the intense noise, while mounted at the side of the cage was a 32—watt, circular
fluorescent lamp for producing the intense light. The contingent onset and termination of
the noise were without noticeable transients, nor did the loud-speaker pick up any clicks
from the operation of relays and other circuit devices. The starting characteristics of the
ﬂuorescent lamp were rendered suitable for use in aversive schedules by a circuit whose de-
tails were published elsewhere (Harrison & Warr, 1959).

The apparatus used on the VI 1 CRF schedules consisted of an enclosure and restraining
cage similar to that described above. The two levers were mounted on adjacent walls of the
cage, and the discriminative stimuli were delivered via a tweeter loud-speaker and a 5-watt
bulb. Food pellets, 45 milligrams each, were delivered to a food cup from an Anger feeder.

For the auditory-threshold measurements the stimuli of different levels of intensity were
presented automatically. The number of times each intensity level was presented was re-
corded on counters.

The background noise in the enclosure, as measured by a Scott sound meter type 410 - C,
varied between 60 and 70 decibels. The frequency spectrum of the background was un-
known, and the extent to which this renders the absolute-threshold measurements really
differential measurements could not be determined.

Behavioral Measures

The aversive schedules were run for 56-minute sessions. The mean response rates for
Rp and RR over the session for both schedules were calculated as follows:

Total number of Rp in sound

 

Mean rate Rp = (R’s/min)

Total time sound on (min)
Mean rate RR = Total number Of RR (R’s/min)
Total time sound off(min)

 

Cumulative records were taken as follows. Each lever press, Rp, moved the pen stepper
one division; the pen was displaced upwards (“reinforcement marker”) during periods of
silence. Thus, the return of the pen to the downward position indicates the occurrence of
a release, RR.

The discriminative schedule was run for sessions varying between 20 minutes and 2 hours.
Cumulative records were taken of responding on the ﬁrst (VI 1) lever. The number of pre—
sentations of each discriminative stimulus, the number of responses on L 2 in the presence
of the discriminative stimuli, the number of responses on L 2 in the absence of the stimuli,

 




AUDITORY SYSTEM OF THE MEDULLA 209

and the number of responses on the ﬁrst lever were recorded on counters. For threshold
measurement the stimulus values were presented automatically, and a record was taken on
counters of the number of times each value was presented. Latency of responding to the
discriminative stimuli was cumulated on a slow—speed clock, and individual latencies could
be taken on a high-speed clock.

General Experimental Procedure

The general plan of the experiments was as follows. Animals were conditioned on either
the termination or the termination-onset auditory schedules together with one or more of
the other schedules to criteria of either stability or rate value. Since these experiments were
carried out over a period of about 2 years, the actual criteria values varied so that the be-
havior for the last few sessions prior to operation is given below for each animal. Lesions
were then placed in the ventral medulla with the intention of damaging the ventral second-
order pathways while leaving the dorsal pathways intact. Following recovery from the oper-
ation,the schedules were again run, and they continued for a sufﬁcient number of sessions to
allow the effects ofthe lesion to be determined. This number varied between 5 and 38 daily
sessions for the auditory schedules.

At the conclusion ofthe postoperative running, the animals were killed and the locus and
magnitude ofthe lesions determined. The anatomical methods used together with the results
will be published elsewhere (Harrison, 1960). For the purposes of the present paper the ani-
mals were divided into two classes: those with extensive (E) bilateral damage to either or
both the large ﬁber pathway ofthe ventral acoustic stria and the lateral lemniscus, and those
with minor (M) damage to these pathways. The experimental history ofeach animal is given
in Table 1.

and those having minor (M) lesions of the auditory system. An inspection of the ﬁgure
shows that extensive lesions reduce the average rate of the Rp on the auditory schedules to
a value consistently below the preoperative values, while having little effect upon the rate
of Rp on the visual aversive schedules.

Examples of the changes in the cumulative records of the auditory schedules produced by
extensive lesions are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. In the case of BW 1 (Fig. 2), behavior on the
schedule rapidly declined during the ﬁrst 4 postoperative days to a very low level of a few re-
sponses per session. This decline occurred in 80% ofthe animals, and is the typical course of
behavior following large lesions ofthe ventral acoustic system. Since from 7 to 19 days inter-
vened between the last preoperative and the ﬁrst postoperative sessions, this decline may be
an example of a weakened “lay-off” effect as described elsewhere (Harrison & Abel-
son, 1959). The cumulative records of Z 39 (Fig. 3) show the highest level of responding
found in the present series of animals with extensive lesions. The postoperative rate of Rp in
this animal (which had a very extensive lesion) was about one-tenth of the preoperative rate.
Since the postoperative rate of responding of Z 39 is about 10 times the operant level, the
responding must be considered as residual behavior generated by the schedule. From con-
sideration of BW 1 and Z 39, the effect ofthe lesion on Rp appears to be a reduction in rate,
but not necessarily to zero.

The effect of a minor lesion upon the cumulative record of responding on the auditory
schedule is shown in Fig. 4 (Animal BW 4). A transient change occurred in the record fol-
lowing operation, but within 7 days (sessions) it approximated its preoperative appearance.

A versz've Schedules, R R

The average rate of RR over each session is shown for the last three preoperative and all
postoperative sessions for all animals in Fig. 5. An inspection of this ﬁgure reveals that ex-
tensive lesions of the auditory system raise the rate of releasing on the auditory schedule
while having little effect upon the release rate on the visual aversive schedule. Minor lesions
of the auditory system were without effect upon the rate ‘of release on both auditory and
visual aversive schedules. In all the affected animals the release rate on the auditory sched-
ule tended to approach its high value over the ﬁrst three or four postoperative sessions in a
manner analogous to the postoperative decline in rate of Rp.

The effect of an extensive lesion of the auditory system on releasing is shown in Fig. 2.
Following operation, periods of no sound (pen displaced upward) become progressively
shorter over the ﬁrst few days until, ultimately, a press is followed by a release within an
average of3 seconds. (See a of Fig. 2.) The lack of effect of a minor auditory lesion on re-
leasing is shown in Fig. 4.

Responding on L 2 (momentary discrimination with a limited hold) for all animals is
given in Table 2. The behavior was expressed by taking the ratio of the average percentage
of possible reinforcements received postoperatively to average percentage preoperatively.

 




AUDITORY SYSTEM OF THE MEDULLA 213

Two animals (C 11 and RA 12) showed a postoperative loss of control of responding on L 2
by the sound. Light continued to control responding in C 11, so it appeared that the audi-
tory loss was due to factors speciﬁc to auditory stimulation. The attempt was made to recon-
dition C 11 using a high-intensity noise (1 11 decibels) as the discriminative stimulus, but no
stimulus control was obtained. In the case of RA 12, it will be noted that the light stimulus
disturbed the control of responding considerably. This suggests that the auditory loss may
not be due, solely, to auditory factors.

Table 2 indicates that Animals BW 1, E l, and Z 32 showed no discriminative loss in spite
of extensive auditory lesions and loss of responding on the auditory aversive schedules. Ani-
mal BW 1 showed a postoperative increase of threshold on the discriminative schedule of
10 decibels. Animal E 1 showed an increase in threshold of 20 decibels. No animal with
minor lesions showed loss oflight or sound discriminations.

Figure 6 shows the percentage of possible reinforcements obtained per session and the
rate of responding on L 2 in SA for BW 1. Clearly, the lesion had no effect on the stimulus
control of responding on L 2. This result may be compared with the change in behavior of
this animal shown in Fig. l and 2. Also shown in Fig. 6 is similar behavior for Animal C 11.
The loss of control of responding on L 2 by the auditory stimulus was virtually complete.
Light control was unaffected.

Figure 4. Animal BW 4. Noise termination-onset schedule. Cumulative records of the 33rd, 34th, 35th hours
(last hour prior to operation) and the lst, 4th, 7th postoperative hours.

A summary ofthe behavior ofall the animals on all the schedules is given in Table 2. The
horizontal line divides the animals into a group with extensive lesions (above the line) and a
group with minor lesions. Inspection ofthe table reveals the following points.

The ratios of postoperative to preoperative rates of Rp and RR on the auditory aversive
schedules in animals above the line differ by a large factor from the ratios of the same rates
of animals below the line. The ratio of rates of Rp and. RR on the light-aversive schedule are
essentially the same above and below the line and also do not differ materially from the
sound-aversive ratios below the line. Taking these observations together, it appeared that
extensive lesions of the ventral acoustic system differentially affected responding on the
sound— and light-aversive schedules.

Both small (0.01) and near-unitary values of ratios of percentage of possible reinforce-
ments (sound) occur in animals with extensive auditory lesions. These data taken together
with the data mentioned in the above paragraph indicated that extensive lesions of the
acoustic system diﬂerentially aﬂected the control of behavior by auditory stimuli.

ANALYSIS

The nature of the changes in auditory-stimulus control produced by the lesions of the
auditory system may be investigated by the attempted reproduction of these changes in
normal animals through manipulation of the variables which have been shown to control

the affected behavior. Two experiments were carried out within this framework and are re-
ported below.

 




 

AUDITORY SYSTEM OF THE MEDULLA

Removal of the Intense Noise

Inspection of Fig. 1 suggested that behavioral changes produced by lesions may be similar
to those produced by the removal of the noise in the termination-onset schedule. To deter-
mine the effects of this operation on the behavior generated by the schedule, four animals
were conditioned under the standard conditions. The animals were then laid off for from
1 to 4 days. Daily running for at least 14 days was then recomm‘enced under identical con-
ditions except that the ampliﬁer which supplied the noise was not turned on. Heifer-
line (1950) refers to this procedure as up—reSponse restoration.

A summary of the changes produced in the average daily rates of Rp and RR by the re-
moval of the noise is shown in Fig. 7 for all animals. Cumulative records from two of these
animals, BW 38 and BW 36, are shown in Fig. 8 and 9.

Changes in Rp. Removal of the noise produced an immediate reduction in the rate of Rp
in all animals. Animal BW 37 showed a further decline from the rate on the ﬁrst no-noise

essentially the same as those produced by the auditory lesions. This suggests the possibility
that the effect of the lesion on Rp may be equivalent to turning off the noise.

Changes in RR. Inspection of Fig. 7, 8, and 9 indicates that the animals fall into two
groups with respect to changes in average rate of RR produced by removal of the noise. In
two animals, BW 37 and BW 38, removal of the noise had little effect upon the release rate
for 8 to 9 days. In the other two animals, BW 36 and BW 41, removal of the noise immedi-

ately increased the rate of releasing to the operant level. The auditory lesions produced an
immediate increase in rate of RR in all animals. In the absence of further data the effect of
the lesions on the rate of releasing cannot be concluded as equivalent to turning off the
noise.

Reduction in Intensity of the Noise

The differential effect of auditory lesions upon aversive and discriminative functions of
auditory stimuli together with the increase in discriminative threshold suggested the pos-
sibility that the lesions raise the threshold of all auditory-stimulus functions. On this as-
sumption the intensity of the noise (109 to 124 decibels) would be below the aversive thresh-
old postoperatively. An investigation of the aversive-threshold region published elsewhere
(Barry & Harrison, 1957) gave results with respect to Rp that differ from the behavioral

changes produced by the lesion. However, in this study, cats were used rather than rats, and
only the termination schedule was investigated. To obtain a more comparable picture, two
animals (GF 10 and GF 11) were conditioned on the termination-onset schedule at
118 decibels, given a 3—day lay off, and run for an additional 14 days at an intensity of
97 decibels (a reduction in intensity of 21 decibels).

Changes in the mean daily rate of pressing and releasing produced by lowering the in-
tensity are shown in Fig. 10 for both animals. Sample cumulative records from one of these
animals (GF 11) are shown in Fig. 11.

As can be seen from Fig. 10 and 11 the behavioral changes produced by lowering the in-
tensity of the noise by 21 decibels were quite different from the effect of the lesion. (See
Fig. 2.) Thus, the effect of the lesion is not simply one of shifting the threshold of all audi-
tory-stimulus functions by about 21 decibels.

SUMMARY

The purpose of the present experiments was to investigate the effects of lesions of the
ventral acoustic system of the medulla upon auditory-stimulus functions. Rats were run on
one or more of the following schedules, received lesions of the auditory system, and were
re—run for a sufﬁcient number of daily sessions to determine the behavioral effect of the
lesions. The schedules on which the animals were run were as follows.

Aversive. Termination-onset. Intense noise as the noxious stimulus. Termination.

The results were as follows.

Extensive lesions of the ventral acoustic system or the lateral lemniscus reduced the rate
of pressing and raised the rate of releasing on the auditory aversive schedules. The lesions
had no effect upon responding on the visual aversive schedule.

Extensive lesions of the ventral acoustic system had no effect on responding on the
VI 1 CRF chain (with either light or sound as S") in three of the ﬁve animals in which re—
sponding on the auditory aversive schedules was affected.

Two analytical experiments were carried out as follows.

Four animals were conditioned to the standard criteria on the auditory termination—onset
schedule. The noise was then turned off and remained off for the next 14 sessions. The effect
of this was to reduce the rate of pressing (Rp) by about the same amount as lesions of the
auditory system. The rate of releasing was increased in two animals and not affected in the
other two. It was concluded that the effect of auditory lesions on the release rate was not
equivalent to turning offthe noise.

Two animals were conditioned to the standard criteria on the auditory termination—onset
schedule. The intensity ofthe noise was then reduced by 21 decibels for the next 14 sessions.
The changes in the rates ofpressing and releasing produced by this intensity change did not
resemble changes in these rates produced by the lesions ofthe auditory system.

THE ACQUISITION AND EXTINCTION OF CONDITIONED SUPPRESSION
AS A FUNCTION OF THE BASE-LINE REINFORCER

IRVING GELLER
WYETH INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH

In the conditioned-suppression procedure of Estes and Skinner (1941), operant behavior
is suppressed during the presentation of an originally neutral stimulus that has been paired
previously with a pain shock. Recently, some attention has been given to variables that seem
to inﬂuence conditioned suppression because of their more direct effect on the operant-
behavior base line. Brady (1955) studied the rate of extinction of conditioned suppression
as a function ofthe positive-reinforcement schedule used to maintain the base-line behavior
in extinction. Essentially, his study showed that the rate of extinction of conditioned sup-
pression was increased for reinforcement schedules that provided a relatively high density
of positive reinforcement. Fixed—ratio base lines of 6:1 and 12:1 gave faster extinction of
conditioned suppression than did 30— and 60-second, variable-interval base lines.l

Stein et a1. (1958) manipulated the durations of the conditioned stimulus and the interval
between the conditioned stimuli. They found that the most important determiner of sup-
pression was the ratio of the durations of the conditioned stimulus to the between—stimulus
intervals. Also, they observed that the rats earned a constant number of reinforcements in
each session regardless of the conditioned stimulus and between-stimulus durations, and
despite wide differences in the degree of behavioral suppression induced by these variables.
On the basis of these and other ﬁndings, Stein and the other investigators concluded that
“ . after sufﬁcient training, animals will suppress in the stimulus period only to an extent
that does not markedly reduce opportunities for positive reinforcement.”

Thus, both studies indirectly implicated the base-line reinforcer as a critical determiner
of the strength ofconditioned suppression. In the present study the base-line reinforcer was
explicitly manipulated by comparing the effects of sweetened milk and water reinforcers on
the acquisition and extinction ofconditioned suppression.

METHOD

General

Two groups of rats were trained on a conditioned-suppression procedure. One group was
reinforced with sweetened condensed milk on a 2-minute, variable—interval schedule, and the
other was reinforced with water. After all the rats had exhibited a speciﬁed strength of con-
ditioned suppression, extinction of the suppression was begun by omitting the pain shocks.
In the extinction phase ofthe experiment, halfthe animals in each group were continued on
the positive reinforcer used during acquisition, and half were switched to the other rein—
forcer. Between the acquisition and extinction phases, a period of 2-minute, variable-
interval training with the extinction-phase reinforcer was given, so that the rats whose re-
inforcers were switched would have stable operant—behavior base lines in extinction. Thus,
in addition to providing information about the effect of the base-line reinforcer on the ac-

1The rate of extinction with a continuous-reinforcement base line fell below the ﬁxed-ratio base lines even
though the density of reinforcement under conditions of CRF may be presumed to have been greater. This appar-
ent discrepancy may reﬂect, in part, a satiation effect, since in the 4 minutes prior to the onset of the conditioned
stimulus, the animals on continuous reinforcement could have acquired enough reinforcements.

quisition and extinction of conditioned suppression, this design permits a determination of
the extent to which suppression acquired under one reinforcer will transfer to another.

Apparatus and Subjects

The apparatus was a small sound-resistant chamber with a lever, an automatic liquid
feeder, a small 2-inch speaker for the presentation of auditory stimuli, and a grid ﬂoor for
the delivery of pain shocks to the animals’ feet. The shock level was calibrated prior to each
experimental session. The entire experiment was programmed by a series of relays and
timing circuits, and recorded automatically by electrical-impulse counters and cumulative-
work recorders.

The subjects were 12 male albino rats of Holtzman Sprague-Dawley strain, 150 days old
at the start of the experiment.2 Six animals were maintained on a 23.5-hour food deprivation,
and given 0.5-hour free feedings after each experimental session. The other six were main-
tained on a 23.5-hour water deprivation, and given water for 05-hour periods after each
experimental session.

Procedure

The rats were trained to lever press for either liquid food or water on a continuous rein-
forcement schedule (approximately 100 reinforcements). They were then given 20-minute
sessions each day on a 2-minute, variable-interval schedule. When the lever-pressing rates
for all animals appeared to be stable, conditioning trials were begun. Twelve minutes after
the start of the session, a 3-minute tone was presented. This tone was terminated con-
tiguously with a brief (0.25 second) 0.75—milliampere pain shock. The animals were given
one trial per day for a total of 27 conditioning trials, at the end of which time all animals
had met a conditioned-suppression criterion. The suppression was expressed as the ratio of
the response rate during the tone period to the rate in the 3-minute period just preceding.
When all animals simultaneously achieved suppression scores of 0.10 or less, the acquisition
phase was terminated.

At this time the groups were divided into extinction subgroups roughly matched on the
basis of the last suppression-ratio score. Half the animals in each group were maintained on
their acquisition-deprivation schedule, and half were switched to the other. All animals had
14 sessions of 2-minute VI so that the switched animals could adapt to the new reinforcer.
Extinction was begun on the following day.

The procedure in extinction was the same as that in acquisition except that the pain
shocks were omitted. Extinction trials were given until the suppression ratio for each animal
was 0.90 or higher. All animals received seven extinction trials.

water reinforcement. Inspection of the individual cumulative lever-pressing records early in
extinction indicates that extinction is more rapid for milk-reinforced animals. Figure 4 gives
these records for all animals on Trial 3. Note that all animals extinguished on a water base
line remained suppressed (except for Rat 27), while all food—rewarded rats showed little
suppression.

It should also be observed that considerable, but not complete, transfer of suppression oc—
curred when the base-line reinforcer was switched. Returning to Fig. 1 it may be seen that
on the ﬁrst extinction trial the mean suppression score for both subgroups with switched
relnforcers approximates zero. It may be seen in addition that the milk-milk curve is below
the water-milk curve and the water-water curve is below the milk—water curve. Since the
unswitched member of each pair (matched for extinction reinforcer) extinguishes more
slowly than the switched member, we may conclude that transfer is incomplete. In view of

the small number ofsubjects in each subgroup, such an inference is suggestive and requires
replication for conﬁrmation.

Discussion

The present ﬁndings emphasize the importance of the base-line reinforcer in the elabora-
tion of a conditioned suppression. One might assume that the poorer suppression exhibited
by milk—reinforced animals is attributable to the superiority in reinforcing value of milk

relative to water. In other words, operant behavior reinforced with milk is harder to disrupt
than that reinforced with water because the milk-reinforced behavior is stronger. For ex-
ample, water-reinforced behavior on ﬁxed ratio might be expected to strain at a smaller
ratio than milk—rewarded behavior.

Unfortunately, the milk and water conditions of the present experiment differ in more
than reinforcing value. The qualitative differences between food and water, entailing im-
portant differences in the deprivation regimen, make it difﬁcult to single out reinforcement
value as the critical differentiator.

An experiment is now in progress to elucidate this point. This experiment is similar in
design to the present one, but different concentrations of milk reinforcement are used as the
independent variable.

SUMMARY

  
     
 

This investigation compared the rates of acquisition and extinction of conditioned sup-
pression as a function of the positive base-line reinforcer used to maintain the operant be-
havior. The base-line reinforcers compared were sweetened milk and water. Acquisition of
the suppression was slower for the milk-rewarded group than for the water-rewarded group.
Food-reinforced animals extinguished more rapidly than did the water-reinforced animals.

Animals that acquired the suppression under one positive reinforcer and were switched to
to other during extinction exhibited almost complete transfer of the conditioned sup—
pression.

Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior

SOME NOTES ON THE CONTROL OF CONDITIONED SUPPRESSION‘

PETER L. CARLTON and PAULINE DIDAMO
SQUIBB INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH

The original study ofconditioned suppression (Estes & Skinner, 1941) demonstrated that
lever—pressing behavior was markedly attenuated in the presence of a stimulus that had been
regularly terminated with the delivery of a brief, unavoidable electric shock. The more re-
cent study by Stein, Sidman, and Brady (1958) indicated that the extent of suppression was
inversely related to the proportion of the experimental session occupied by the shock-
terminated stimulus. The absolute duration of the stimulus period or of the no-stimulus
period appeared to be unrelated to the observed reduction of suppression. Rather, the
amount of time spent in the period of stimulus presentation relative to that spent in the
absence of the stimulus (i.e., “on-time/olT-time”) appeared to be the signiﬁcant variable.

A second ﬁnding was that the number of reinforcements the animal received remained
fairly constant over a wide range of variations in on-time/off-time. To quote the authors:
“This ﬁnding suggested that, after sufﬁcient training, animals will suppress in the stimulus
period only to an extent that does not markedly reduce opportunities for positive reinforce-
ment. In some interval-combination programs. . . .complete suppression during the clicker
period will not appreciably reduce the number of reinforcements that can be obtained in a
daily session, as nearly all that set up in the stimulus period can be claimed shortly there-
after in the following stimulus-off period. In other programs, however, complete suppres-
sion in the clicker will markedly reduce the total number of reinforcements that can be
earned in an experimental session.”2 They also suggest that the magnitude of suppression
was reduced to the extent that such suppression resulted in missed reinforcements; i.e., the
animal’s response output varied in such a way as to minimize the loss of reinforcements.

Although not entirely clear in the article, the cited quotations and the method of estimat—
ing reinforcements missed suggest that the authors attributed the changes in suppression to
changes in the total number of reinforcements missed. For example, an animal that receives
100 reinforcements in a 2—hour session at one on-time/olT—time value may receive a total of
65 in the ﬁrst session at a higher on-off ratio. It is presumably this difference (100 vs. 65 rein-
forcements) which is discriminated by the animal and which controls the loss of suppression
in subsequent sessions. Instead of the assumption that animals discriminate between the total
reinforcements accumulated during a 2- or 3-hour session, however, this discrimination
could have been based on the rate at which reinforcements were delivered, i.e., on the num-
ber of reinforcements received in relatively short periods of time.

Insofar as the study of Stein et al. is concerned, the distinction between reinforcement
rate and total reinforcements missed is a purely verbal one; if an animal’s response rate
varies in such a way that reinforcement rate is constant, the total number of reinforcements
will also be constant if the duration of experimental sessions is ﬁxed, as it was in this study.
In a situation in which sessions are continued until a ﬁxed number of reinforcements has
been delivered, however, the results predicted by the two formulations are opposite.

The hypothesis that the total number of reinforcements missed controls the extent of sup—
pression implies that suppression is independent of variations in relative stimulus—on time if
experimental sessions are continued until a constant number of reinforcements has been re-

ceived. Under these conditions, a shift from a low on-time/oﬁ-time value to a higher one
should not result in a loss of suppression, since total reinforcements cannot change. On the
other hand, reinforcement rate will decline to the extent that suppression increases at the
higher on-olT value; the hypothesis that reinforcement rate controls the extent of suppres-
sion therefore implies a subsequent loss of suppression. The experiment reported in the next
section bears on these considerations.

PROCEDURE

The subjects were two adult, male albino rats maintained at 650/O of their free-feeding
weights. The apparatus was a sound-insulated response chamber containing a lever, a
motor-driven dipper, a speaker, and a grid ﬁoor through which shocks could be delivered.
Both rats were trained to depress the response lever to receive reinforcements (0.1 cubic
centimeter of diluted condensed milk) on a variable-interval schedule (mean interval equal
to 2 minutes). In the ﬁrst phase of the experiment, 3-minute periods of tone were pre-
sented once an hour; the terminations of these were coincident with the delivery of a
1.5- to 2.0-milliampere, 0.5-second shock. In the two subsequent phases the time intervening
between tone presentations (off-time) was decreased; the duration of the tone (on-time) was
constant at 3 minutes. Each phase was continued until the extent of suppression was stable
from day to day (about 25 sessions).

In Phase I, each session was 3 hours. In Phases II and III the sessions were continued until
each animal had received a number ofreinforcements equal to the mean number received in
the last three sessions of Phase I. Thus, in the later phases, a rat could not “lose” rein—
forcements regardless of the extent of suppression. The procedures are summarized in the
table in the upper portion of Fig. 1.

CONDITIONED SUPPRESSION

RESULTS

The data were treated in terms of response rates (responses / minute) calculated for the tone
periods (r,) and for the no-tone periods (rm). The lower portion of Fig. 1 is a plot of the
median values of the ratios of these rate measures (rt/rm) for the last ﬁve sessions of each
phase. In Phase I the ratios approach zero, indicating nearly complete suppression of lever
pressing in the tone periods. As the relative amount oftime that the tone sounded (on-time/
off-time, on the abscissa) was increased, both rats showed losses of suppression. In both
cases the curve describing these changes was an increasing, decelerating one. With Rat E-00,
this function rose throughout the experiment, whereas that for Rat E-Ol apparently reached
a maximum in Phase II. ,

Since the total number of reinforcements delivered was constant throughout the experi-
ment, the hypothesis that the total number of reinforcements missed attenuates suppression
probably cannot reasonably account for these data. However, reinforcement rate could co-
vary with changes in on-time/off—time. This ﬁnding suggests that changes in response out—
put which minimize the decline in reinforcement rate may account for the observed loss of
suppression. As previously indicated, the reinforcement-rate hypothesis can account for
both the present data and those of Stein et al.

DISCUSSION

Several salient aspects of the general notion of reinforcement rate as a controlling vari-
able should be mentioned. First, shifts in reinforcement rate are presumed to be discrimi-
nated by the animal; this suggests that some sort of a “Weber-Fechner” relationship holds.
The general form of the curves in Fig. l bears this out in that they indicate that progres-
sively larger increments in on-time/off—time would be required to produce equal changes in
suppression. Apparently, the difference between on-olf ratios of 0.53 (Phase I) and
1.0 (Phase II) is effectively greater than the differences between 1.0 and 3.0 (Phase III). The

fact that Stein et al. found suppression to be a linear function of log (on-time/olf:time) also

supports this supposition.

Further, such a generalization probably holds true when reinforcement rate is varied
directly. A study by Wilson (1954), for example, showed that as the value of the interval in
a ﬁxed-interval schedule was increased from 0 to 5 minutes, the fall in response rate was
described as a decreasing, decelerating function. In general, the differences in rate were
greater if small-interval rather than large-interval groups were compared. A similar curve
was obtained by Kaplan (1952), who investigated intermittent reinforcement of an escape
response.

These considerations lead to a second point. If the changes in reinforcement rate in part

control both response rate and extent of suppression, then animals that are relatively sensi— s

tive to changes in, for example, variations in the mean interval of a variable-interval sched-
ule should also be relatively sensitive to variations in the on-off ratios in a conditioned-
suppression situation. In particular, animals showing larger deCrements in response rate
with decreasing reinforcement rate should show relatively greater losses of suppression with
increases in on-time/off—time. Further, a change in reinforcement rate is presumably more

discriminable if the preceding reinforcement rate has been high. It follows that conditioned "

suppression should be less if superimposed upon a schedule in which reinforcement rate
has been high.

REPEA TED CONDITIONING—EXTINCTION SESSIONS AS A FUNCTION
OF THE REINFORCEMENT SCHEDULE‘

DONALD H. BULLOCK
INSTITUTE OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITAL

Weissman (1959) has reported on the behavior of rats under conditions of mix FR 24 ext
10 minutes and mix F1 2 minutes ext 10 minutes. “A ratio of responses in each 10—minute ex—
tinction period to responses per reinforcement” yielded a range of 2.6—5.3 for the FR 24 rats
and of 2.8—3.2 for the F1 2 minutes rats. In this paper, data are reported for pigeons after
sessions consisting of 20 FR 10 ext 60 minutes and 20 F1 26 seconds ext 60 minutes, follow-
ing the procedure of Bullock and Smith (1953).

METHOD

Six adult, male White Carneaux pigeons (5—6 years old) were maintained at 80% of their
free-feeding body weights and given preparatory training similar to that described in
Ferster and Skinner (1957). After several CRF sessions, each bird was given a 60-minute ex-
tinction session, as recommended by Clark (1958) for eliminating “superstitious” behavior
acquired during magazine training and shaping of key pecking. Three pigeons (505, 1442,
2556) were then placed on FR 10 and given 4000—5000 reinforcements during several ses-
sions lasting 30—60 minutes. They were then given daily sessions (except for weekends) in
which 20 FR 10’s were followed by ext 60 minutes without any change in the discriminative
stimuli. The other three birds (1826, 3017, 4105) were placed on F1 26 seconds and given
900—1000 reinforcements during several sessions lasting approximately 60 minutes. They
were then given daily sessions (except for weekends) in which 20 F1 26 seconds were fol-
lowed by ext 60 minutes without any change in discriminative stimuli.

RESULTS

The number of responses during the conditioning portion of each session and the number
of responses per the 60-minute extinction portion were estimated by measuring cumulative-
response records. The number of “response units” per extinction period was then deter-
mined by dividing the total number of extinction responses by the average number of re-
sponses per reinforcement, the procedure used by Weissman (1959). Figure 1 presents the
range of total extinction responses (responses divided by 10) and the range of extinction
response-units for the FR 10 and F1 26 seconds groups during the ﬁrst 18 sessions. Table 1
presents the number of extinction response-units per pigeon for Sessions 14—18.

Weissman (1959) reported ranges of response-units of 2.6—5.3 for rats on FR 24 and
ranges of 2.8—3.2 for rats on F1 2 minutes. Despite the differences in species (rats vs. pi-
geons), procedures (mixed extinctions vs. repeated conditioning-extinction sessions), and the
actual FR and F1 values, the data from the present study are very similar to those reported
by Weissman. In general, the performances during the ﬁnal sessions for both groups were
characterized by an initial “priming run” of either ratio (FR group) or interval (FI group)

extinction behavior. Therefore, the research is being continued, in which the values of

INSTANTANEOUS LAMP REPLACEMENT

ROBERT M. HERRICK

U. S. NAVAL AIR DEVELOPMENT CENTER
JOHNSVILLE, PENNSYLVANIA

Undesirable consequences ordinarily follow the failure of a cue lamp. To help prevent
lamp failure, two procedures are suggested: (a) operate the lamp below its rated voltage and
thereby increase its expected life, and (b) replace the lamps frequently. Although these pre-
cautions will decrease the likelihood of lamp failure, they cannot guarantee it. Therefore, a
system should be included which (a) detects lamp failure and (b) immediately introduces a
replacement lamp. These two objectives may be achieved by means of a low-voltage relay.
(See Figure 1.) When the program switch is closed, low-voltage relay KS is energized and
Lamp No. 1 is in operation. If Lamp No. l burns out, Relay KS de-energizes, and, through
its normally closed contacts, Lamp No. 2 goes into operation.

Figure 1. Circuit diagram.

The small voltage drop across the coil of Relay KS causes Lamp No. l to be operated
slightly below its rated voltage. The resistor, R, in series with Lamp No. 2, equalizes the
voltage drops across the two lamps so that the light emitted by the lamps will be equal. (The
unused normally open contact of Relay KS can be connected to a monitoring device.)

When the program switch is closed, Lamp No. 2 might go on momentarily. However,
with a tungsten lamp the ﬂash is not likely to occur, because the “warm-up” period required
before a tungsten lamp emits light is ordinarily longer than the time required for KS to
energize. However, with gas-ﬁlled lamps, Lamp No. 2 probably will light momentarily when
the program switch closes. Such a ﬂash oflight from Lamp No. 2 can be prevented by plac-
ing in series with the Lamp No. 2 circuit a set of normally open contacts of another relay
which receives power when the program‘switch closes.

Proper selection of the low-voltage relay requires a knowledge of (a) the voltage at which
the lamp will be operated and (b) the current drawn by the lamp at that voltage. For ex-
ample, say a 28-volt lamp is to be operated at 26 volts DC. and is found to draw 70 milli-
amperes when operated at 26 volts. With a 28-volt DC. power supply the relay coil should
require 70 milliamperes at 2 volts. If the current requirements cannot be met exactly by a
readily available 2-volt D.C. relay, a resistor, connected either in parallel with the relay coil
or in parallel with the lamp, can be used so that both the relay and the lamp operate at their
proper currents.

In addition to the lamp-replacement application described above, the low-voltage relay
can be used in series with other electrical components for monitoring purposes and for in—
stantaneous replacement of key components.

FREE-OPERANT BEHAVIOR UNDER CONDITIONS OF DELAYED
REINFORCEMENT. I. CRF—TYPE SCHEDULES

PETER B. DEWS
HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL

It has been suggested that an important determinant ofthe effects of drugs on behavior is
the frequency of occurrence of the response under study under control conditions, i.e., in the
absence of drug (Dews, 1958). It is therefore of pharmacological interest to study means of
modifying the over-all tendency to respond. Long ago, Skinner (1938, p. 139) showed that
delay of reinforcement led to a lowering of rates of response of rats working on a ﬁxed—
interval schedule of reinforcement, although it did not clearly interfere with conditioning on
a CRF procedure (Skinner, 1938, p. 72). The present experiments were similar in conception
to those of Skinner, but differed in the following particulars:

1. They have been performed on pigeons. The response used, the peck, seems to be
naturally discrete and brief. A lever press by a rat, as used by Skinner, can, on the
other hand, have appreciable and varying duration. Skinner deﬁned the response as the
initial depression of the lever, but this introduces an arbitrariness that is almost com-
pletely circumvented when the peck of a pigeon is used as a response.

. The basic schedule was CRF in type, in that every response was potentially reinforced.
Perhaps partly because of this, longer periods have been able to be studied (10, 30, and
100 seconds) as compared with Skinner’s (2, 4, 6, and 8 seconds). Skinner used the
CRF procedure only in studies on acquisition.

. The effects of permitting additional responses to be made during the “delay” period
has been studied explicitly. ‘

Ferster has studied the effects of delay of reinforcement on the rate of responding of
pigeons working on a 1-minute variable interval of reinforcement (VI 1 min) (Ferster, 1953).
He introduced the device of completely darkening the experimental space during the period
between the occurrence of the response-to—be-reinforced and the presentation of the rein-
forcing stimuli. Under these conditions, Ferster was able to gradually introduce delays of re—
inforcement of up to 60 seconds without appreciable reduction in rate as compared with
that on simple VI 1 min. The occurrence of darkening of the experimental space may be ex—
pected to have acquired conditioned reinforcing properties in these experiments, and so they
are not comparable with those of Skinner or with the present series.

The schedules used in the present work may be conveniently viewed as related to the con-
verses of the familiar DRL- and FI-type schedules. In a DRL x sec schedule the reinforcer
is presented when the sequence “x seconds without a response and then a response” has oc-
curred. In an F1 x sec schedule the reinforcer is presented when the sequence “elapse of
x seconds (during which time responses are without programmed consequence) and then a
response” has occurred. The schedules now to be described are of two types. In one type
(type N1 T32”, see below), the reinforcer was presented when the sequence “a response,
and then x seconds without a response” had occurred. In the other type (type N1 Tx", see
below), the reinforcer was presented when the sequence “a response and then the elapse of
x seconds (during which time responses were without programmed consequence)” had
occurred.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The experiments were conducted on ﬁve White Carneaux pigeons maintained at 80% of
body weight on unlimited food. A standard pigeon apparatus was used (Ferster & Skinner,
1957, p. 14) with the usual response key and reinforcing mechanism.

’ Schedules

The basic schedule was that a response started a ﬁxed-period timer. and at the conclusion
of the timing cycle the food magazine was operated. There were two variants of this basic
schedule: type N1 71?”, in which responses during the x-second timing cycle “re-set”
the timer (the symbol N1 signiﬁes that a response was necessary to start the timer, and the
bar over Tx” signiﬁes “without a response”); and type N1 Tx”, in which, when the ﬁrst re-
sponse following a reinforcement had started the x—second timer, subsequent responses were
without consequence. Thus, on type N1 T327 schedules, the minimum time between a re-
sponse and the operation of the magazine was determined exclusively by the ﬁxed-period
timer and was constant at x seconds. On the other hand, on type N1 Tx” schedules the mini-
mum time between a response and operation of the magazine depended on occurrence of re-
sponses during the cycle of the ﬁxed—period timer. It could take, thus, any value up to a
maximum ofx seconds. Values ofx of 10, 30, and 100 were studied for both schedule types.

Procedure

An experimental session was ordinarily 1 hour long. On schedules leading to frequent re-
inforcements the sessions were shortened to prevent satiation effects. Experiments were con-
ducted 6 days per week.

The birds studied in these experiments had had extensive and varied previous experience
on other schedules. All had, at some time or other, been exposed to either VI 1 min or VR
100, and all came into the experiments with a strong tendency to respond. All birds except
Pigeon 7 were ﬁrst exposed to a schedule intended to be N1 T10”. After about
10 days, the timer was found to have become defective, and the value of the delay was vary-
ing from a few seconds up to considerably more than 10 seconds from reinforcement to re-
inforcement. Figures from these sessions are not included in Table l. Thereafter, the follow-
ing sequences of presentations ofschedules were followed.

Following a change in schedule type or parameter, at least 5 sessions and usually 10
sessions were allowed for stabilization, before collection of numbers was started for com-
pilation of Table 1. Mean ﬁgures in Table 1 are based on 10 or more “control” days, a
control day being deﬁned as one, following stabilization, on which a drug had not been
given either on that day or on the preceding day.

Observations were made on the effects on type N1 T—x” schedule performances of
pentobarbital and of methamphetamine at the following dose levels: pentobarbital sodium.
1.0 and 3.0 milligrams; methamphetamine hydrochloride, 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 milligram. The

before the start of the session. The doses stated are the total doses for the bird.

RESULTS

Responding was sustained by the type N1 :17 schedules at all the parameter values
studied. For example, Bird 7 was observed in these experiments for almost 180 experimental
hours, the last 48 of which were on N1 T100”. On this schedule the rates
of responding in the 6th, 7th, and 8th hours were 56, 60, and 32 responses per hour, re—
spectively; the rates in the 38th, 41st, and 46th (the last three control sessions, as deﬁned)
were 41, 52, and 76 responses per hour, respectively.

The mean rates of responding decreased as the duration of delay increased, falling from
111 responses per hour on N1 T10” to 26 responses per hour on N1 W, with the rate
on N1 W intermediate at 83 responses per hour (Table l). The frequency of reinforce-

ment also tended to fall with increasing delay. Two full daily sessions of Bird 7 on each
ofthese procedures are shown in Fig. 1.

Note the progressive increase in over-all rate as the parameter value ofthe type N1 Tx” schedule is reduced.

The rates of responding on these schedules were characteristically quite variable, both
within individual sessions and from day to day. The average coefficient of variation of the
number of responses in the daily sessions was about 0.50 for N1 W and
about 0.75 for N1 T100". Most of the reported ﬁgures on the session-to-
session variability of pigeons working on schedules providing immediate reinforcement of
appropriate responses are considerably smaller than these. For example, the session-to-
session coefﬁcient of variation on V1 1 min has been found to be usually less than 0.10
(Dews, 1955). The large day—to-day variability of performances on N1 T—x7 sched—
ules makes it necessary to consider the possibility that the apparent dependence of mean
rate on schedule parameter described above was simply due to sampling errors. Examina-
tion of Table 1, however, makes it clear that for each individual bird, as for the grand
means, the mean rate of responding on the schedule with the longer delay was lower than
the rate for the shorter delay. Seven such comparisons can be made; the probability that

 




DELA YED REINFORCEMENT 225

the same rank order would occur by chance in all seven pairs is 1 in 128, so that the de-
pendence of rate on schedule parameter is almost certainly a real phenomenon.

Following a change in schedule or in parameter value, the performances stabilized within
a few sessions, in the sense that the over-all rate of responding, around which the day—to-
day variability was occurring, showed no obvious trend (Fig. 2). In view of this, it was

though, in general, 10 sessions were allowed for “stabilization.” No claim is made that
“complete stability” had been attained in the sense of complete absence of trend; it is
doubtful if SUCh “Stability” has ever been proved in a behavioral situation. The most that
can be said is that the day-to-day trend is small relative to the effects of the variables
under study.

At any given parameter value, the rate of responding on type N1 Tx” was usually
higher than that of the same bird on type N1 TX”, The mean rate was about 10
times greater at each of the parameter values (Table l). The frequency of reinforcement
also rose. There were, however, marked individual differences among the birds, All ﬁve

strated in the sessions for Pigeons 74 and 76 shown in Fig. 3. Bird 7 had a higher rate on
N1 W but Bird 76 did not. These ﬁndings are illustrated in Fig. 4. Birds
76 and 152 had essentially the same rates of responding on NI T100" and
N1 T100”, but Birds 74 and 158 had much higher rates on the latter (23 vs. 580 and 23 vs.
618 responses per hour, respectively). Sample sessions are shown in Fig. 5.

Note that for each ofthe pigeons, transfer from type N1 Tx” to type N1 Tx" schedule led to a considerable in—
crease in over-all rate of responding.

The mean rate of 26 responses per hour on N1 T100” is so low that the
question arises as to whether the response-requirement contingency was having any sustain-
ing effect on the responding. To investigate this, three of the birds were studied on a pro—
cedure in which the magazine operated at 100-second intervals, irrespective of the behavior
of the bird. This schedule is designated T100” in Table 1 and Fig. 6. Ten sessions were run.
Under this procedure the rate of responding was much lower than on N1 T100”: 2.22 as
compared with 11, 9.62 as compared with 21, and 1.02 as compared with 23 responses per

reinforcements per hour on T100” as compared with a mean of 7.5 reinforcements per hour
on NI T100”. It seems clear that the response requirement of N1 T100” had a deﬁnite ef-
fect in enhancing the frequency of responding.

Determinations of parts of the dose-effect curves for pentobarbital and for methamphet-
amine were made on two birds (74 and 76) on NI T10”, on one bird (7) on

bital and methamphetamine were found which tended to increase the rate of responding
(Fig. 7). Most interesting was an interaction between schedule parameter and drug. The

longer the delay and the lower the consequent control3 rate of responding, the greater was
the tendency of optimum doses of methamphetamine to cause an increase in rate of re-
sponding. The reverse situation was obtained with pentobarbital. The shorter the delay of
reinforcement, and thus the higher the control rate of responding, the greater was the ef-
fect of the optimum doses of pentobarbital in increasing the rate of responding. These re-
lationships are illustrated for selected doses of the two drugs in Fig. 8, and sample sessions
are shown in Fig. 9 and 10.

DISCUSSION

Clearly, behavior in pigeons can be maintained under conditions of delay between re-
sponse and presentation of reinforcement. This is Shown by the long periods over which
responding was continued under these contingencies and by the quick fall to new low rates
when the response dependency of reinforcement was removed (T100”).

The maximum delay at which behavior iS maintained was not: determined, but it is clearly
in excess of 100 seconds, since at a 100—second delay the rate of responding was several
times higher on the average than when responses were without programmed consequence. It
Should be noted, however, that the effect of the reinforcer is being measured here in terms
of its ability to maintain previously well—conditioned behavior. The eﬁfects of delay of
reinforcement on initial acquisition have not been studied in this series of experiments.

The effect ofthe presentations of food—the reinforcements—on the behavior of pecking
the key, as measured by the rate ofpecking, decreases as the time interval between the peck
and the reinforcement increases. In other words, retroactive enhancement of the likelihood

of future occurrences of the response decreases as the time interval between response and
reinforcement is lengthened. The curve of control values shown in Fig. 8 cannot be taken as
a direct estimate ofthe true form of the relationship between the reinforcing power of a re-
inforcement and its temporal contiguity to a response. This is because the type N1 T)?
schedules have inherent in them a “differential reinforcement of low rates” contingency,
in that, on NI T7, inter-response times of less than x second lead to postponement
of reinforcement, and only inter-response times as great as x seconds permit reinforce-
ment. By analogy to conventional DRL schedules, this contingency would be expected
to depress the rate of responding, so, in general, the rates engendered by type
Nl T? schedules would be expected to be lower than those which would have de-
veloped if the rate-elevating effect of even the delayed reinforcement had been unopposed.
No speciﬁed behavior is necessary during the time between the response of pecking the
key and occurrence of the reinforcing stimulus, except that on type N1 Tx” the
key must not be operated. Presumably, some behavior occurring during this delay will be
fortuitously reinforced (Skinner, 1948). Such behavior is characteristically variable; and
since it may compete with key-pecking behavior, it will contribute to the observed variabil-
ity in frequency of key pecking. The difference in rate on NI T? and on N1 Tx” at the
same value of x is clearly dependent on circumstances of adventitious reinforcement. In
order for the change in schedule to have a consequence for the pigeon, responses must oc-

cur during the delay time. Such responses are closer to the time of presentation of the re-
inforcing stimulus; so the delay of reinforcement of the recorded responses will be effectively
reduced, and this, as shown in this paper, will tend to increase the rate. In addition, the
N1 Tx” schedules do .not differentially reinforce low rates of responding as do the
N1 Tx” schedules, since the former permit any inter-response time to be con—
cluded by reinforcement. The removal of the DRL contingency would also be expected to
permit the rate to rise on N1 Tx” schedules as compared with corresponding
N1 Tx” schedules.

The range of time intervals between response and reinforcement studied in these experi—
ments covers the frequently used RS intervals of operant-avoidance procedures; in these
procedures, as in the present experiments, the external consequences of the responses are

inevitably delayed. Preferred intervals between CS and US in Pavlovian conditioning are
usually shorter. Increasing the RS interval in avoidance procedures or the CS—US interval
in Pavlovian conditioning beyond, at most, a very few minutes leads to extinction. On the
other hand, in experiments with positively reinforced operants, the time between a response
and the next occurrence ofthe reinforcing stimuli may be many minutes or even hours. For
example, typical ﬁxed-interval behavior has been maintained in pigeons with ﬁxed intervals

 




DELA YED REINFORCEMENT 231

up to 150 minutes (Dews, unpublished observations); under these conditions, substantial
rates of responding are maintained at times in the interval 1—2 hours before possible
reinforcement. The salient difference between this situation and the others referred to earlier
in this paragraph is that with ﬁxed-interval schedules, and most other schedules of positive
reinforcement, the response-to-be—reinforced is followed essentially instantaneously by the
reinforcing stimuli, whereas with the schedules of this paper, operant avoidance, and Pav-
lovian conditioning, the environmental reinforcing stimuli supervene only after some delay.
Ordinary schedules ofpositive reinforcement thus retain the precision ofcontrol characteris-

recorded response during the presentation of an SD and can thereby occasion large outputs
of behavior over prolonged periods oftime.

The ﬁndings reported are of some practical interest in connection with the commonly

 




232 PETER B. DEWS

used practice of imposing a short “changeover delay” when it is desired to eliminate the
effects on rate of responding in one (usually SA) component of a multiple schedule of the
reinforcing effects ofthe stimulus change. Under conditions of “changeover delay,” it is ar-
ranged that the stimuli will not change within x seconds of a response. It is often assumed
that values of x as short as 5 seconds are sufficient to completely eliminate the reinforcing
effects of the change of stimuli on the tendency to respond. The present work shows that
even 100 seconds is not necessarily long enough for this purpose.

Drug Eﬁ’ects

There is now quite general recognition of the importance of the type of schedule of re-
inforcement under which an animal is working in determining the behavioral effect of a
drug. The present experiments show clearly that not only the nature of the schedule but
also its parameter values have large effects. For both of the drugs studied, the effect on
behavior maintained by a single type of schedule, N1 Tx”, varied several—fold depend-
ing on the value of x. Not only does the parameter value modify the effects of the drugs,
but it does so differentially in the sense that the functional dependence of drug effect
on parameter value for pentobarbital is quite different from that for methamphetamine. The
nature of this functional dependence is evidently a matter of considerable pharmacological
1nterest.

Responding almost ceased after the pentobarbital, while the methamphetamine led to a period of sustained re-
sponding at a rate sufﬁciently high to preclude the possibility ofoccurrences of reinforcements.

It has previously been suggested that an important determinant of the effects of amphet-
amines is the control rate of responding, in that the lower the control rate, the greater
the proportionate increase to be expected following optimum doses of amphetamine (Dews,
1958). The results of the present study are in complete agreement with this suggestion.
The increase in rate following 0.3 milligram of methamphetamine was only about 10%
when the control rate was about 11.0 per hour, but was some 8300/O when the control rate
was 26 per hour (Fig. 7). As previously found, for some time after the administration of
1.0 milligram of methamphetamine, all but the most strongly maintained behavior tends to
be reduced.

Pentobarbital, on the other hand, shows increasing rate-enhancing action with increase
in control rate of responding. One possible interpretation, which is in agreement with tra-
ditional views of the behavioral effects of the drug, is as follows. The frequency of rein—
forcement on N1 T—lO7’ was on the average greater than 1 per minute. Such
a high frequency might be expected to engender a high tendency to respond. The nature of
the schedule, however, “requires” that the rate of responding be “suppressed” to a rel-
atively low level. On N1 T100" the rate of occurrence of presentations of the reinforcing
stimuli was less than 0.15 .per minute, so the amount of “suppression” necessary to con-

 




234 PETER B. DEWS

form to the schedule might have been less. If pentobarbital were to “attenuate the sup-
pression” or “release the inhibition,” then a greater effect would be seen on NI T10”
performance than on NI T100” performance, as observed. While this interpretation is ad
h0c, and many other accounts are compatible with the present data, the above view has
the advantage of being in accordance with the impressions gained from clinical experience
with barbiturates and drugs with similar pharmacological effects.

SUMMARY

The performance of pigeons has been studied on schedules on which reinforcing stimuli
were presented only when a response was followed by some speciﬁed “delay” period with-
out a response. Even when this period was as long as 100 seconds, responding was main-
tained at rates in excess of those resulting from presentation of the reinforcing stimuli
at 100-second intervals entirely noncontingent on responding.

Waiting periods of 30 seconds and of 10 seconds between response and reinforcing stimuli
have also been studied; the over-all rate of responding was higher with the shorter waiting
periods.

The effects of pentobarbital and of methamphetamine were found to be differentially
modiﬁed by change in the waiting period.

The rate of responding tended to be higher on schedules similar in all respects except
that responses during the “delay” period did not postpone reinforcement.

Animportant way in which drugs affect behavior is to change the frequency with
which an easily repeatable response is made (4, 2). Such effects are probably best
studied as effects on the final stable pattern of responding engendered by a schedule of
reinforcement (1) . A schedule of reinforcementis aformal statement of deliberately
arranged relations between a response and the occurrence of a particular kind of
stimulus, called a reinforcer, which influences the future frequency of emission of
that response under similar environmental circumstances. The term schedule is ex—
tended to refer to the actualprogrammed arrangement of the contingencies between
response and reinforcement. In addition to the nature of the response and the rein-
forcing stimulus, and the state of deprivation of the animal and related factors, the
schedule of reinforcement is an extremely important determinant of the frequency
and temporal pattern of occurrence of responses. With many schedules, if an an-
imal is given repeated exposures to the schedule (e. g., in daily experimental ses-
sions), a stable day-to-day performance develops. Further, an animal may be
subjected to more than one type of reinforcement schedule during each session.
For example, during a single session, reinforcement may occur sometimes at the
50th response made from the onset of a stimulus (FR 50) and sometimes at the
first response after 15 minutes has elapsed from the onset of a stimulus (F1 15).
If the stimuli present during the FR and F1 components are different(e. g., different
colored lights on the response key for the pigeon), eventually the performance in
the presence of each of the two stimuli comes to be appropriate to whichever schedule
component is in operation. In this example, a high constant rate of responding oc-
curs when the fixed-ratio component is current (similar to that seen during con-
tinuous operation of a simple fixed—ratio schedule), and a lower, progressively
increasing rate of responding occurs during the fixed-interval component (simi-
lar to that seen during continuous operation of a simple fixed-interval schedule).
This type of compound schedule is called a multiple schedule (4, p. 503). While
there is undoubtedly some interaction between the behaviors on the component
schedule, the performances during the individual components retain most of the
features of the performance of animals working on that schedule alone (4, p. 503; 2).

If the different components of a compound schedule are not correlated with spe-
cific environmental stimuli-- if the key color, etc., remain constant irrespective
of which schedule component is current-— the compound schedule is called a mixed
schedule. A variety of such schedules has been described by Forster and Skinner
(4). The interaction between schedule components is much greater with a mixed
schedule than with the corresponding multiple schedule. For example, on a mixed
schedule with components of Fl 15 and FR 50 (i. e., similar to the multiple schedule
described above), the Fl 15 components start with a period of fast responding, in
contrast with the very low initial rates in the Fl 15 components of the multiple
schedule; FR 50 components produce similar behavior on the two schedules (4).
The differencesinthe behavior of the animal in the different components of a mixed
schedule cannot be based on a discrimination of exteroceptive environmental stim-
uli, since, apart from the time of occurrence of the reinforcement, all such stim-
uli are constant throughout the session. It has been suggested that such discrimi-
natory performances are more sensitive to modification by drugs than are discri-
minations based on explicit environmental stimuli (1, 6).

In the present experiments, the mixed schedule with fixed—interval and fixed—
ratio components (mix F1 15 FR 50) described above has been used to generate a
base line for studies on the effects of two drugs, chlorpromazine and promazine.
These drugs differ only in that chlorpromazine has chlorine and promazine has
hydrogen at position 2 on the phenothiazine nucleus. They are used clinically for
similar purposes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The Subjects were four mature, male Carneaux pigeons, maintained at 80 per
cent of their weight when given free access to food. Their previous histories dif-
fered widely; all had had considerable experience on other schedules. They were
studied in experimental spaces arranged in the form of a "turntable" (5). A stan—
dard pigeon key and food magazine were used. The response was a peck of the key
which tripped a relay, and the reinforcing stimulus was the operation of the food
magazine giving the pigeon access'to food for 4 seconds. The schedule was pro-
grammed with electromagnetic relays and counters, and with electric timers.

The sequence of components (of the mix F1 15 FR 50) was kept constant through
all the experiments; the sequence was (R equals fixed ratio, I equals fixed interval):
RRRIRIIRRRRRRRRRRIIR. For purposes of description the five interval
components will be referred to as first through fifth according to their order in this
sequence in the individual sessiOns. Each bird was exposed to this routine for 5 days
per week (Monday through Friday). Although the performance on Mondays did not
differ noticeably from that on other days, drug observations were not made on
Monday. When inspection of the cumulative records indicated a stable day-to-day
performance had developed (see Fig. 1), drug injections were made occasionally
on days of the week other than Monday. The hydrochlorides of the drugs were dis-
solved in 0. 9per cent sodium chloride solution and injected intramuscularly. Doses
are given. in terms of the total dose to the bird. (The weights of these birds varied
from 400 to 430 grams. ) The injections were made between 4 and 7 hours prior to
the experimental session. Each day on which adrug was given was paired with an-
other day (usually the preceding day) on which no drug was given. The results on
the latter days have been used for analysis of the "control" performance. On some
of these days, saline was injected; but since the observations were made at least

 




EFFECTS OF CHLORPROMAZINE AND PROMAZINE 75

4 hours after the injection, the saline injection was found to be entirely without
discernible effect, and, for most purposes, information from saline-injection and
no—injection days has been pooled. For the four birds, an aggregate of 69 control
sessions have been analyzed. Most of the drug observations were made in duplicate
on each bird. The results are presented in the form of a representative series of
cumulative records (Fig. 3 and 4), obtained on the same bird (Pigeon 55), showing
each dose level of drug studied; and also in the form of averaged data taken from
all four birds. Almost all the drug effects described in RESULTS can be clearly
seen both in the behavior of the individual birds and also in the averaged data.

RESULTS

The stable performance was in accord with the description given by Ferster and
Skinner (4, p. 620). Followinga reinforcement, the bird would respond atahigh rate
until either a response was reinforced (if the component was FR 50) or a number
of responses greater than 50 had been emitted (if the component was F1 15). In the
latter case, the initial period of fast responding was followed by a pause and then
the resumption of apattern resembling that developed on a fixed-interval schedule
(4, p. 133). Figure 1 has cumulative records showing the consecutive sequence of
10 fixed ratios and the preceding and succeeding fixed intervals. These samples

are taken from records obtained during an 8—month period and are chronologically
arranged from left to right. There is a progressive increase in the length of the
pause following the initial period of fast responding on the fixed—interval components
through Records A to D; but Records D, E, and F show an essentially stable per-
formance. This figure also indicates that the length of the pause was greater in the
4th fixed interval (following the 10 consecutive fixed ratios) than in the 3rd fixed
interval (which directly followed the 2nd fixed interval). This was a consistent
finding. The 4th interval uniformly had a longer pause and fewer responses, under
control conditions, than did any of the other fixed intervals. This is illustrated in
Fig. 2, which shows the isolated fixed intervals from three representative daily
sessions. Even when the over—all rate of responding fell considerably (as in the
middle row, Fig. 2), this relationship between the numbers of responses in the
4th fixed interval to the numbers in the others persisted. The phenomenon was
studied quantitatively in the following way. The numbers of responses in the five
individual fixed intervals of a session were expressed as a proportion of the total
numbers of responses in all the fixed intervals of that session, and these propor-
tions averaged over the 69 control sessions. The proportions were: 0. 21, 0.21,
0. 24, 0. 12, and 0. 23 for the lst through the 5th intervals, respectively. It will be
noted that in addition to the small number of responses in the 4th fixed interval,
fixed intervals land 2 tended to have fewer responses than fixed intervals 3 and 5.
Fixed intervals 1 and 2 followed fixed-ratio components, while fixed intervals 3
and 5 followed a fixed interval. In short, then, there was clearly a second-order
effect in the sense that the behavior of the animal during afixed-interval component
was influenced by the nature of the preceding schedule components. While this sort
of phenomenon has long been recognized, it has never been systematically studied.

Doses of either promazine or chlorpromazine of 0. 1 milligram had no recog-
nizable effects on the behavior. Even following a dose of O. 3 milligram, the effects
were confined to a slight increase in the periodic irregularities of rate during the
fixed-interval components. (See Fig. 3 and 4, which show the same section of the
daily session as thatin Fig. 1.) Following 1. 0- and 3. 0-milligram doses, the length
of the pause is reduced following the initial high rate in the fixed-interval compo-
nents. This is particularly marked in the 3rd fixed intervals in the illustrated
records, although it also occurred in the 4th fixed intervals, as in the illustrated
record followingr3. 0 milligrams of chlorpromazine. In all these effects, the two
drugs were indistinguishable. Following 10-milligram doses, there is a clear dif-
ference in the effects of the two drugs. Chlorpromazine caused an intensification
of the effects seen with smaller doses; with doses of 10 milligrams or higher, the
abrupt pause is completely abolished, although there is still evidence of a dis-
crimination of the "number" in the fixed ratio since the rate falls from its initial
high level. With promazine at a dose 'of 10 milligrams, in addition to the changes
seen with chlorpromazine, three out of the four birds showed sustained responding
at ahigh rate. The example shown in Fig. 4is the most dramatic;this bird emitted
atotal of more than 14, 500 responses in the five 15-minute fixed intervals, in con-
trast with the control average of about 4000. Higher doses had much less tendency
to cause prolonged responding at high rates, and chlorpromazine in all doses had
much less tendency to do so. (See, however, the effect of 17 milligrams of chlor-
promazine in Fig. 3.)

All these effects are summarized in the dose-effect curve in Fig. 5. The hori-
zontal line designated"saline"was actually obtained from all the control days, in-
cluding days when no saline was injected. (As previously mentioned, an injection

of saline 4 or more hours before the session had no effect on the performance.)
The mean number of responses in the five fixed intervals of control sessions was
3659 responses, with a standard deviation of 950 responses. Since most of the
points on the drug curves are the means of eight observations (duplicate deter-
minations on four birds), the expected standard error of such means is 336 re-
sponses. At doses up to 3. O milligrams, the drugs are similar in their effect on
total output of responses; with doses greater than 3. O milligrams, promazine has
aclear tendency to cause amuch greater output of responses than chlorpromazine.
The figures for promazine are far outside the range which could reasonably be at-
tributed to sampling errors. The individual points for chlorpromazine all fall within
the range expected from sampling errors;however, the persistent elevation of the
curve for doses between 3.0 and 17 milligrams may be indicative of a real effect
of the drug.

Following large doses (greater than 3. 0 milligrams) of either drug, the number
of responses in fixed interval 4 became much more nearly equal to the number in
the other fixed intervals than under control conditions. The ratio of the number of
responses in fixed interval 4 to those in fixed interva15 was used as a measure of
the second-order effect previously described. In the 69 control sessions this ratio
averaged 0.53. Following increasing doses of either drug, the value of the ratio
increased, until following 17—milligram doses, it averaged greater than 1. O (i. e.,
actually more responses were made inthe 4th fixed interval-- following the 10 fixed
ratios—— than in the 5th fixed interval-- directly following the 4th fixed interval).

This phenomenon is illustrated in the dose-effect curve of Fig. 6. The horizontal
dotted line shows the average for the control sessions, while the solid line shows
the pooled results from experiments with both chlorpromazine and promazine.
(Hence, most points are the average of 16 observations.) From the variability of
the control observations the expected standard error of means of 16 observations
is 0. 07; so the effects of the drugs shown in Fig. 6 are clearly far greater than the
expected sampling error.

Finally, high rates of responding were maintained inthe fixed—ratio components
following all doses of the drugs studied, so even the highest doses could not have
caused serious motor incapacity. There is one abnormal period in the fixed ratios
shown in Fig. 3following 17 milligrams of chlorpromazine. Since this was an iso-
lated example, an accidental environmental influence is suspected in this particular
instance.

DISCUSSION

Both chlorpromazine and promazine had marked effects on the frequency of oc-
currence of the response. Probably the most readily affected aspect of the per—
formance was the pause following the initial period of fast responding in the fixed-
interval components of the schedule. This finding is in agreement with the sug-
gestion made in the introduction that discriminatory behavior not based on extero-
ceptive stimuli is more readily disrupted by drugs than discriminatory behavior
based on explicit environmental stimuli. However, it has not yet been established

 




EFFECTS OF CHLORPROMAZINE AND PROMAZINE 81

whether this is a qualitative difference, or whether it depends on the greater consis-
tency and grossness of the environmental stimuli ordinarily used (1, 6). The effect
on the pause in the fixed—interval components is not a specific effect of these drugs;
it has been seen following suitable doses of sodium pentobarbital (4, p. 627) and
methamphetamine (unpublished observations).

The variation in numbers of responses in fixed-interval components has been
attributed to the influence of the immediately preceding schedule components. From
the point of view of formal experimental design, these effects are confounded with
the over-all order of the components, since this was kept constant. Thus, the 4th
fixed interval was always the 4th fixed interval, as well as being the fixed interval
following the 10 consecutive fixed ratios. Inspection of Fig. 2 and the figures given
in the text for the proportionate numbers of responses in the fixed intervals gives no
indication of any important influence of the order of the fixed interval per se on the
performance in the component. There seems to be little doubt that the—preceding
schedule components are of predominant importance in the second-order effect
described.

The considerable difference in the effects of promazine and Chlorpromazine in
large doses on the output of responses shows that the general experimental pro-
cedure is competent to detect differences in the effects of very closely related
drugs. The difference between the effects of the drugs may be only at very high dose
levels; on the other hand, recognition of differences in the effects of the drugs in
clinical doses may only await methods adequate for their detection.

Finally, the progressive abolition of the second—order effect on fixed-interval
responding by both drugs is also in keeping with the suggestion that an important
action of the drugs is to reduce the behavioral control exerted by very subtle (per-
haps particularly endogenous) stimuli, while leaving the control of more gross
stimuli-- such as the key lights and magazine stimuli in this situation-— virtually
unimpaired.

SUMMARY

(1) Chlorpromazine and promazine tend to abolish the pauses in the fixed-
interval components of pigeons working under mix Fl 15 FR 50 schedule of rein-
forcement.

(2) Large doses of both drugs also modified the control over performance in
fixed-interval components exerted by the nature of the preceding schedule com—
ponents. ‘

(3) At the higher doses studied, promazine had amuch more pronounced ten—
dency to cause prolonged responding at high rates than did Chlorpromazine.

STIMULUS-PRODUCING RESPONSES IN CHIMPANZEES1

ROGER T. KELLEHERZ

Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology

Recent analyses of discrimination learning have emphasized a distinction be-
tween responses which are instrumental in obtaining food and responses which re-
sult in exposure to the discriminative stimuli (2, 9, 11). These responses will be
classified in terms of their contingencies; that is, a response of the former type
will be referred to as a food—producing response (Rf), and a response of the latter
type will be referred to as a stimulus-producing response (Rs).

Most analyses have dealt with Rs as a theoretical construct to be inferred from
Rf performance (2, 9). On the other hand, Wyckoff (11) developed a technique for
dealing with Rs directly. He used pigeons as $5 in a free-operant situation. The Rf
was pecking a translucent key; the Rs was pfessing a pedal on the floor of the ex-
perimental enclosure. Periods in which Rf was reinforced on a 1/ 2-minute, fixed-
interval schedule (positive periods) alternated randomly with the periods in which
there was no possibility of reinforcement (negative periods). The key remained
white throughout both positive and negative periods unless Rf occurred; in this
case, the key changed from white to red or green. One of these colors was cor-
related with positive periods and the other with negative periods. Although Rs did
not alter the probability of reinforcement, it did enable the bird to discriminate be-
tween the two conditions. As long as the pedal was; held down, the discriminative
stimuli remained on, but the bird had to leave the'pedal to 'eat. The durations of
the pedal-pressing responses increased as the discrimination developed, but de-
creased when the positive and negative stimuli were reversed or made nondiffer-
ential.

The Wyckoff technique had the disadvantage that the pedal-pressing response
had a very high operant level, and frequently the Rs rates were high despite poor
discriminations. Wyckoff inferred the strength of Rs from the duration of the re—
sponse. A temporal response measure makes it difficult to assess the frequency
of a response or to schedule the appearance of the stimuli which are contingent
upon the response.

The purpose of the present experiments was to investigate variables determining
the frequency of stimulus-producing responses and their relationships to discrim-
ination performance.

METHOD

Subjects Chimpanzee No. 125, 6—year—old male; experimental history: visual
deprivation (6), spatial discrimination (7), play (10).
Chimpanzee No. 160, 5- -year— o—ld female; experimental history: visual
deprivation (6), play (10). 3 Food deprivation: 80 to 85% of body weight
at start of experiments. Reinforcements: 8- -gram pieces Purina Lab
Chow. Diet supplement: vitamins, oranges, skim milk.

Apparatus Experimental chamber: 24- by 36- by 38—inch concrete cubicle, ply—
wood door, expanded metal floor; 24- by 38—inch panel of 1/4—inch a-
luminum mountedinone wall. Manipulanda: two telephone keys, 3 inches
apart on 5- by 8—inch plexiglas window in panel. Stimuli: 60-watt over-
head lamp, audible click as "feedback" for depression of either key,
doorbell chime accompanying operation of food magazine, red and blue
lamps behind telephone keys. Sound mask: continuous white noise. The
procedures were automatically programmed and results automatically
recorded (3).

Procedure Session length: 7 hours (2 hours in Experiment I) or 60 food reinforce-
ments. All stimuli off for l—minute time out (4) following each food
reinforcement, and off indefinitely to terminate each session. After
key-pressing was "shaped up" (8), 3O successive responses were rein-
forced. Then, a 1/2-minute fixed interval (F1 1/2) of food reinforce-
ment was instituted on one key and the other was disconnected. This
schedule was shifted from one key to the other at random (changing
only at reinforcement). Each S received three sessions under this,pro-
cedure, and low and equal rates of responding (about 0.75 per minute)
developed on each key. The red and blue lamps were not illuminated
during this preliminary training.

EXPERIMENT I

The purpose of this experiment was to develop a stimulus—producing-response
technique for use with chimpanzees, and to determine suitable parameters for
further experiments.

Method

Pressing the left key was Rf, and pressing the right key was Rs. As inthe Wyckoff
, procedure, positive and negative periods alternated randomly. During the negative
periods, extinction was in effect on the left key (Rf ext); there was no possibility
of food reinforcement. The lamps behind the keys remained dark throughout both
positive and negative periods unless Rs occurred, in which case the window was
illuminated by the red or blue lamps. These colors were correlated with Fl 1/ 2
and ext, respectively. Following every Rs, the current stimulus was displayed
for a specified interval of time (St). If the positive and negative periods alternated
during this interval, the stimulus color changed accordingly. Over Sessions 1-22,

3 In previous experiments from these laboratories, these animals were designated Chow
and Margo, respectively.

 




STIMULUS - PRODUCING RESPONSES 89

St was 3 minutes; over Sessions 23-26, St was 1 minute; over Sessions 27-35, St
was 1/2 minute. The mean duration of positive and negative periods was 3 minutes,
with a range of 1/2 minute to 5 1/2 minutes. After Session 16, the procedure was
modified so that Rf could not result in reinforcement if it occurred within 3 seconds
of a preceding Rs. For example, if Rs occurred just as a food reinforcement was
"set up" by the FI schedule, the availability of this reinforcement was postponed
for 3 seconds. The occurrence of Rs did not alter programming of the positive and
negative periods or the possibility of food reinforcements. S could "choose"between
mixed (no exteroceptive stimuli) and multiple (exteroceptive stimulus for each com—
ponent) schedules of reinforcement (5).

The dependent variables were the Rs rate, the Rf rate, and the discrimination
ratio (DR). The latter value is obtained by computing the ratio of the rate of re-
sponding in Rf ext to the rate of responding in F1 1/ 2, and then taking the com-
plement of this ratio (1). If the rates in positive and negative periods are equal,
DR will be 0. 00; if responding occurs only in positive periods (Fl 1/ 2), DR will be
1. 00. The DR provides an index of the level of discrimination, which is relatively
independent of absolute rates of responding.

Results

By the 11th session, both Ss had developed clear discriminations (DRs were
more than 0. 90). Throughout the experiment, Rf rates in the positive periods were
highly variable, and ranged from 1. 46-11. 46 per minute for No. 125 and from 1. 61-
11. 10 per minute for No. 160. By Session 15, both _S_s had developed very high Rs
rates (more than 2 responses per minute), although an Rs rate of O. 33 response
per minute would keep the discriminative stimuli continuously visible. When the

procedure was changed in Session 16, the Rs rates dropped precipitously. Over
Sessions 16-22, mean Rs rates for No. 125 and No. 160 were 0. 45 and O. 68 per
minute, respectively. The median DRs over the same sessions were 0. 98 and O. 93
for No. 125 and 160, respectively. Comparable DRs were maintained at each value
of St. Rs rates were also quite variable both within and between sessions at each
value of St; however, the most stable Rs rates were obtained when St was 1/2 minute.

EXPERIMENT II

Inthis experiment, Rf was reinforced by food on a loo-response, variable-ratio
schedule (VR 100), and Rs was reinforced by the onset of the discriminative stimuli
on fixed-ratio (FR) schedules. The intermittent reinforcement of Rs should make
possible a more sensitive analysis of the reinforcing effect of the discriminative
stimuli.

Method

The Ss had been on free feeding for 6 weeks following Experiment I, but were
reduced-to the body weight of Experiment Ibefore this experiment. During the posi-
tive periods, VR 100 (range: 1 to 200) was in effect on the left key. During the nega—
periods, ext was in effect; St was 1/2 minute. The durations of the alternating
VR 100 and ext periods varied randomly from 1/ 2 minute to 10 minutes (mean,
4 minutes). These values were held constant throughout this experiment. During
the preliminary training period of 3 days, the discriminative stimuli were on con-
tinuously. The discriminative stimulus was displayed after each Rs for Sessions 1
to 7; that is, Rs was continuously reinforced (Rs crf). For the remainder of the ex-

;

periment, Rs had to occur a specified number of times to produce the discriminative 5

stimulus; that is, Rs was reinforced onafixed-ratio schedule (Rs FR). For example,
inSession 8, every tenth Rs resulted in the appearance of the current discriminative
stimulus for 1/2 minute (Rs FR 10). Both Ss received 11 sessions at Rs FR 10 and
8 sessions at each of the following: Rs FR 20, Rs FR 30, and Rs FR 60, in that

pear). Beginning with the last session on Rs FR 30, the frequency with which both
keys were pressed simultaneously was recorded. This record indicated the fre- ,
quency with which _S_ used both hands simultaneously.

During the preliminary training, high stable Rf rates deve10ped in VB 100. Table 1

Representative Rf performances are shown in the upper records of Fig. 1 and
2. The segments labelled 1 and 2 in each figure correspond to VR 100 and ext
periods, respectively. During Rf VR 100, both Ss have over-all rates of about
1. 50 responses per second; during Rf ext, the rates are close to zero. With few
exceptions, the positive and negative periods can be easily distinguished on the
basis of the §s' behavior. Long pauses in the record of No. 160 did occur often, and
almost invariably began in Rf ext periods. Rs performances, shown in the lower
records, were recorded concurrently with the Rf curves. Some segments are la-
belled with the same numbers and letters to facilitate comparison. It should be
noted that the cumulative recorders continued to run while the discriminative stimu-
li were visible (during St), but not during time Outs.

During the segment labelled 1 in Fig. 1, a very high Rf rate was maintained;
however, the Rs rate was just high enough to keep the red light on throughout the
period. In the segment labelled 2, the Rf rate was zero, and the Rs rate was higher
than in Segment 1; however, the responses occurred in bursts and the blue light
was off for some of the period. Inanother negative segment labelled 3, the darkened
portions of the Rf curve approximate the times that the blue light was on, and the
small arrows on the Rs curve indicate the response or responses which brought it on.
Throughout the experiment, both Ss tended to pause (on both keys) following the ap-
pearance of the blue light. The short pauses which occasionally occurred on the Rf
curve during positive periods correspond to momentarily high Rs rates (as at a and _c_)
or to a pause on the Rs curve during which the red light disappeared (as, at b). At
this stage of training, both Ss showed a zero Rf rate when neither discriminative
stimulus was displayed. -

In Fig. 2, the lower record shows the performance of No. 160 on Rs FR 20.
Under this schedule, both §S developed local Rs rates of approximately 3 responses
per second. The segments labelled 1 and 2 show representative performances during
positive and negative periods, respectively. The small arrows indicate bursts of
responding on the Rs curves and the corresponding brief pauses on the Rf curve.
InSegment 2, the Rf rate dropped to zero, but the bursts on the Rs curve continued.
During both segments, the Rs rate dropped to zero when the discriminative stimuli
were displayed (that is, during St). In the negative segment labelled 3, two bursts
of 20 responses on the Rs key were followed by a prolonged pause on both keys.
The Rs pause was terminated by a burst of 20 responses in the negative segment
just before a, followed by a short pause through a 30-second positive period and
alonger burst of responding in the next negative segment at a. In the next positive
segment, characteristic performances emerged. Both the Rs-and Rf rates dropped
to zero in the positive period at b; however, the Rs rate near the end of the seg-
ment was unusually prolonged. Sustained high Rs rates accompanied by zero Rs
rates appeared at E and d during a positive period.

The functions for both Ss are similar. After Rs crf, the rates during the posi-
tive periods were consistEntly higher than those during the negative periods. The
rates during the positive periods increased to Rs FR 30, but then remained the
same or fell off at Rs FR 60.

Analysis of the cumulative- -response records indicated that the lower Rs rates
during negative periods resulted from the tendency of both Ss to initiate pauses on
both keys. Although DRs remained high, it is important to note that Rf rates were
usually zero in the absence of the red or blue stimuli. At Rs FR 30 and FR 60,
No. 160 began to show intermediate Rf rates in the absence of the discriminative
stimuli; therefore, the DR values were lowered for this S. Observation of No. 160
indicated thatSwas using both hands simultaneously on the two keys, No. 160 showed
30 such responses in the last session at Rs FR 30 and hundreds of simultaneous
responses at Rs FR 60. However, no simultaneous responses were recorded for
No. 125.

The positive and negative periods can no longer be distinguished on the basis of
the response patterns of either S on Rs ext (Fig. 5). Discriminations of both _S_s
were abolished in this extinction session (DRs were zero). The lettered Rf curves
show pauses intermingled with intermediate .and high Rf rates. The Rf rates of
No. 160 were erratic, but high, and S received 60 reinforcements. No. 125 showed
low over-all Rf rates and responded only sporadically in the hours of the session

remaining after the arrow which terminates the curve. The negatively accelerated
Rs ext curves were sizable (No. 160: 1341 responses; No. 125: 3112 responses).
The earlier portions of these curves tended to be bi-valued, but some intermediate
rates did occur as the asymptote was approached. During Rs ext, 4 and 27 si-
multaneous responses were recorded for No. 160 and 125, respectively. The seg-
ments at a, _b, and g in the Rf and Rs records of No. 125 are corresponding, and
these probably were the segments in which _S_ used both hands.

EXPERIMENT III

The purpose of this experiment was to re-determine the functions obtained at
some of the Rs schedules used in Experiment II. Both §s received four sessions
at each of the following Rs schedules: crf, FR 30, and FR 60. These were followed
by one session of Rs ext.

The median Rs rates in positive (cross-hatched lines) andnegative (dashed lines)
periods at each Rs schedule of Experiment III are shown in Fig. 4. Again, the first
session at each value was omitted in computing the median. The median Rs rates
and DRs for No. 125 were little changed. However, the rates of No. 160 at Rs FR 30

 




STIMULUS - PRODUCING RESPONSES 95

and FR 60 were considerably lower than in the determinations of Experiment I,
and the function is flatter. The median DRs of No. 160 dropped to O. 90 and 0. 95 at
Rs FR 30 and FR 60, respectively. This drop resulted from frequent responding
in the absence of the discriminative stimuli.

Many simultaneous responses (ranging from 6 to 67) were recorded for No. 160
over these sessions. This S's frequent use of both hands was not related in any
consistent way to an Rs schedule. No simultaneous responses were recorded for
No. 125 in these sessions.

The local rates of responding at Rs FR 30 and FR 60 (Fig. 6) remained stable
at about 3 responses per second. Thus, the changes in the over- -all Rs rates of
this S were primarily due to the frequency and duration of pauses. The broken seg—
ments indicate sections of the curve in which S was pausing and have been omitted
for convenience inpresentation. Corresponding pauses occurred in the Rt records
(as in Fig. 2). The pauses were still initiated innegative periods. Prolonged bursts
of responding (as at a, b, and _c_) occurred frequently in both positive and negative
periods. Both Ss continued to show high Rf rates. In the absence of the discrimina—
tive stimuli, No. 125 sometimes had low Rf rates, and No. 160 had some high Rf
rates. The sessions of Rs ext which directly followed Rs FR 60 are shown in
Fig. 7 and 8. Again, the DRs were close to zero for both animals. The Rf curve
of No. 125 (Fig. 7) was low for about the first 30 minutes of the session, but then
became high and sustained. The Rs ext curve contained 1715 responses. Although

this extinction curve was smaller than the preceding one, it showed the same gener-
al characteristics; that is, bi-valued rates of responding gave way to some inter-
mediate rates and over-all negative acceleration. In this Rs ext session, 34 si-
multaneous responses were recorded for No. 125.

The Rf curve of No. 160 (Fig. 8) was characterized by an initial portion which
was highly similar to that of No. 125. For the remainder of the session, however,
prolonged bursts of responding alternated with pauses ranging from a few minutes
to more than 45 minutes. The Rs ext curve of No. 160 contained 3576 responses.
The over—all curve again showed negative acceleration; however, the initial portion
was steeper and more prolonged than the previous Rs ext curve. Large bursts of
responding still occurred late in the session, and intermediate rates were infre—
quent. For No. 160, 15 simultaneous responses were recorded on Rs ext.

EXP ERIMENT IV

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of eliminating the
discriminative function of the stimuli by making them nondifferential with respect
to positive and negative periods.

Method

The system of alternation of positive and negative periods was the same as in
Experiments II and HI, and St was again 1/ 2 minute. Periods in which either the
red or blue lights would appear following Rs also continued to alternate randomly;
however, this schedule of alternation was independent of the alternation of positive
and negative periods; that is, the red and blue lights were no longer correlated
with either type of period exclusively. The Rs schedule was FR 60 for Sessions 1-19.
Over Sessions 20—24, the stimuli remained on continuously even when the Rs rate
was zero. Over Sessions 25-31, the stimuli were again discriminative and re-
mained on continuously. The DRs were still computed on the basis of rates of re-
sponding in positive and negative periods rather than the presence of the red or
blue stimulus.

Results

The DRs remained close to zero throughout the sessions in which the stimuli
were nondiscriminative; therefore, the Rf rates for both positive and negative periods
will be combined. The Rs rates will also be combined since they no longer differed
with respect to positive and negative periods. By the third session, the Rf rates
had fallen to low values (1. 14 and 10. 52responses per minute for No. 125 and 160,
respectively). These rates subsequently recovered, and median Rf rates over Ses-
sions 13-19 were 73. 27 and 34. 23 responses per minute for No. 125 and 160, re-
spectively.

The daily Rs rates for both Ss are shown in Fig. 9. The curves fall slowly and
there are several reversals. The rates of No. 125 (solid line) remained close to
zero over Sessions 13-19, while those of No. 160 (dashed line) stabilized at about
3. 5 responses per minute. Figure 10 shows a portion of the cumulative record of
No. 160 from Session 2. TheRf records are characterized by bursts of responding
alternating with pauses. At this stage of the experiment, the Rs records of No. 160
differed little from those of the previous experiment (Fig. 6). The Rs rates of
No. 125 were lower during this session than in the previous experiment. For most
of this session, the Ss' rates were still under the control of the red and blue lights

even though these were no longer discriminative stimuli. The first segment in the
Rf record of Fig. 10 was a negative period. When the red light appeared at a, a
high rate developed immediately;however, this rate was sustained through a posi-
tive period (at 2) although the blue light was on during the segment. Shifts from
high rates during the red light to low rates at the appearance of the blue light are
shown at _c_ and h. Both of these periods were negative. Positive periods in which
zero rates accompanied the blue light followed by negative periods in which high
rates accompanied the red light are shown at d and e. Positive periods in which
the red light was on are shown at f and g. There Was only slight attenuation of
stimulus control in this session. -

No. 160 emitted 20 simultaneous responses in Session 2, 15 in Session 3, 19 in
Session 11, and 11 in Session 12. No. 125 showed only 1 simultaneous response
over the first 3 sessions. In Session 4, 131 simultaneous responses were recorded;
and, in Session 5, 12 simultaneous responses were recorded. After Session 5,
however, such responses were very infrequent for No. 125.

casionally.

Figure 12 contains aportion of the cumulative-response record of No. 125 from
Session 20 in which the stimuli remained on continuously. In general, high rates
of responding still prevailed in the red light (as at e); however, pauses did occur

occasionally (as at a). When the color changed to blue, there was still a tendency
to pause, but short bursts of responding were frequent in the blue l1ght (as at b, g,
d, and f). The figure shows that stimulus control remained strong in this session.
By Session 22, the response rates had become equal in both colors. Rs rates re-
mained close to zero throughout these sessions.

For Sessions 25 to 31, the stimuli were again correlated with the respective
schedules of reinforcement and were on continuously. The DRs of No. 160 rose
rapidly, and the median DR over Sessions 29-31 was 0.97. No. 160 recovered the
discrimination more slowly; the median DR over the last three sessions was 0. 75.

DISCUSSION

The results of Experiment I confirm Wyckoff's finding that discriminations can
be developedunder conditions where the appearance of the discriminative stimulus
is dependent upon Ss' behavior (11). The results also show that Rs rates can be
sustained at the three values of St used. Unfortunately, there was much variability
in both Rf and Rs rates. Under an F1 schedule, the passage of time during Rs re-
sponding increases the probability that Rf will be reinforced. Thus, an Rf following
a series of Rs' s is likely to be reinforced and a chain of responding deve10ps. Ob-
servation of Ss suggested that this factor was responsible for the high Rs rates
which developed under the first procedure when St was 3 minutes. When the pro—
cedure was changed to militate against the development of such a chain (Method,
Experiment I), the Rs rates dropped precipitously. The new procedure did change
the characteristics of the FI schedule, however, and may have increased the vari—
abilityian rates. This finding suggested the desirability of using a schedule of fOOd

 




STIMULUS - PRODUCING RESPONSES 101

reinforcement which is not programmed by time. It should be noted that Wyckoff's
procedure involved an F1 schedule, which may have influenced his results.

Experiments II and III demonstrate that substantial Rs rates can be sustained
at FR schedules ranging up to 60. The Rs FR performances of both Ss had the same
characteristics as FR schedules of food reinforcement (5). The over—all Rs rates
apparently reached an asymptote at about Rs FR 30 at the Rs schedules used here.

The over-all Rs rates of No. 160 were quite low in Experiment III. The differ-
ence in Ss' performances in Experiment 11 may have resulted from No. 160's
starting to respond with both hands simultaneously before the Rs ext session. The
Rf rate of No. 125 remained very low in Rs ext, and few food reinforcements were
received in the absence of the discriminative stimuli. On the other hand, No. 160
maintained high Rf rates in Rs ext and received many food reinforcements in the
absence of the discriminative stimuli. Probably because of this experience in Ex-
periment II, No. 160 showed some high Rf rates in the absence of the discrimina—
tive stimuli in Experiment III. The cumulative records of No. 160 from Experi-
ment III show that the discrimination was not at all attenuated in the presence of
the discriminative stimuli; thus, the lowered DRs resulted from responding in the
absence of these stimuli.

The pauses following the appearance of the blue stimulus which resulted in the
lower Rs rates during negative periods suggest that the conditioned-reinforcing
effect of the negative stimulus was lower than that of the positive stimulus.

The Rs ext sessions provide one control for artifacts; that is, the only change
in the programming equipment was the disconnection of the red and blue lamps. ,
The fact that the DRs fell to zero indicates that these colored lights provided the
only discriminative stimuli. The Rs ext curves are similar to those obtained in
the extinction of FR schedules of food reinforcement. Clearly, the appearance of
the discriminative stimuli maintained the Rs performance. The possibility re-
mained, however, that their appearance rather than their function as discrimina-
tive stimuli provided the reinforcing effect.

The results of Experiment IV demonstrate that the discriminative function of
the stimuli is necessary if they are to function as conditioned reinforcers. How—
ever, the Rs rates extinguished far more rapidly when the stimuli did not appear
at all. In the early portions of Experiment IV, the Rf rate remained high in the
formerly positive (red) stimulus and remained close to zero in the formerly nega-
tive (blue) stimulus. Thus, almost all food reinforcements still occurred in the
formerly positive stimulus; however, the reinforcements occurred only half as
frequently, and _S_s often emitted hundreds of responses when the formerly positive
stimulus was displayed (Fig. 10) without receiving a reinforcement. With extensive
exposure to this condition, the stimuli lost their effectiveness as conditioned rein—
forcers and the Rs rates fell to very low values. At the same time, a high Rf rate
developed and was maintained throughout each session (Fig. 11).

Simultaneous responses on both keys were recorded for both SS in the Rs ext
sessions and in the earlier sessions of Experiment N. In both cases the experi-
mental operations eventually resultedin extinction of Rs rates. Further study would
be necessary to specify the factors involved in such simultaneous responding.

When the stimuli were on continuously in Session 20 of Experiment IV, there
was a "spontaneous recovery" of the stimulus control (Fig. 12). This occurred

 




102 ROGER T. KELLEHER

despite the fact that the Rs rates had been maintained at very low values for about
seven sessions. This finding suggests that the number of responses necessary to
produce the discriminative stimulus (the Rs schedule) may be critical.

The technique used in these experiments could prove to be invaluable in as-
sessing the effects of many variables upon discrimination performance (for example,
aversive stimuli, brain lesions, drugs). If _S_ will respond to produce the discrimi—
native stimuli, we can assume that it is "attending" to these stimuli; the Rs rates
could serve as an operational index of "attention." Investigators sometimes indi-
cate that they are not subjectively sure whether adiscrimination was really lost or
whether S just stopped "attending" to the stimuli. The present objective technique
might enable us to make a useful distinction between these possibilities. '

AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR AND THE DEVELOPMENT

OF GASTRODUODENAL ULCERS

JOSEPH V. BRADY, ROBERT W. PORTER
DONALD G. CONRAD, AND JOHN W. MASON

Walter Reed Army Institute of Research

Observations in our laboratory over the past year or more have revealed the
development of extensive gastrointestinal lesions in a series of some 15 monkeys
restrained in chairs and subjected to avariety of prolonged behavioral conditioning
and/ or intracerebral self-stimulation experiments (1). The behavioral studies fo-
cused upon emotional conditioning procedures of the "fear" or "anxiety" type, and
upon avoidance of noxious electric shocks to the feet. Intracerebral self-stimu-
lation through chronically implanted electrodes involved various limbic—system
structures. While the program for each animal in this initial series varied con-
siderably, all were subjected to intensive experimental study for at least 2 to 8 weeks.
Five control monkeys, subjected only to restraint in the chair for similar periods,
however, showed no gastrointestinal complications.

The present report describes the results of an experiment designed to define some

of the more specific behavioral factors contributing to the etiology of this lethal path-
ological picture. Eight rhesus monkeys, restrained in chairs, as illustrated in
Fig. 1, were divided into pairs and conditioned according to a "yoked-chair" a-
voidance procedure. Each pair of monkeys received brief electric shocks (5 milli-
amperes, 60-cycle AC, for 0. 5 second) to the feet from a common source every
20 seconds unless the experimental animal of the pair pressed a lever which de—
layed the shock another 20 seconds for both animals (2). Inactivation of the lever
available to the control animal insured an equal number and temporal distribution of
shocks to both monkeys ("physical trauma"), while providing the avoidance contin-
gency for only the experimental animal. Each pair of monkeys received 6—hour ses-
sions on this procedure, alternating with 6-hour "off-periods" (no shocks) 24 hours
each day for periods up to 6 or 7 weeks. A red light was illuminated in plain view
of both animals during the 6-hour "avoidance" periods, and was turned out during
the 6—hour off-periods. The experimental procedure was programmed and the ani-
mals' behavior recorded automatically by timers, magnetic counters, cumulative-
work recorders, and associated relay circuits. Lever responses and shocks were
recorded continuously for all animals, and separate counts were maintained for
the avoidance periods and for the off-periods. Throughout the entire experiment,
urine was collected continuously from all animals in 24- or 48-hour samples for
17—hydroxycorticosteroid determinations.

illustrate the "yoked-chair" avoidance situation. The lever available to each animal is shown

within easy reach, although only the experimental "avoidance" monkey on the left is observed
to press the lever.

The avoidance behavior was trained initially during two preliminary daily ses-
sions of 2 to 4 hours. The training procedure involved the use of a short 5—second
interval between shocks in the absence of a lever response (the "shock—shock" or
"S-S" interval) and a ZO-second interval between lever responses and shocks (the
"response-shock" or "R-S" interval). At the outset, a lever response by either ani-
mal of a given pair delayed the shock for both animals and no further "shaping" of the
behavior was attempted. Within the first preliminary session, however, one monkey
of each pair was observed to develop avoidance lever-pressing before its partner
and was selected as the experimental animal. At this point in the preliminary training

procedure, both the "shock-shock" and the "response-shock" intervals were set at
20 seconds and the control monkey's lever was made ineffective with respect to
avoiding shocks for the remainder of the experiment.

Within a few hours after the initiation of the alternating 6-hour sessions, the
experimental animals of each pair had developed stable avoidance lever-pressing
rates (Fig. 2) which showed little change throughout the experiment. Responses
during the 6-hour off-periods in the absence of the red light rapidly dropped to a
low level, as shown in Fig. 2, and also remained there throughout the experiment.
Since the lever—pressing rates for the experimental animals during the 6-hour a-
voidance periods approximated 15 to 20 responses per minute, the behavior ef—
‘ fectively prevented all but an occasional shock for both animals throughout the
alternating 6—hour "on-off" cycles of any given 24-hour period. The shock rates
never exceeded 2 per hour during the 6-hour avoidance periods, and typically aver-
aged less than 1 per hour. For the most part, only somewhat variable "operant

1evels"of lever-pressing were maintained by the control animals of each pair, al—
though one of these animals did appear to develop what might be termed a "super-
stitious avoidance" rate during the 3—week alternating procedure. From an initial
rate not exceeding 1 response per hour during the first few days on the procedure,
this control monkey gradually increased his output to 2 responses per minute by the
10th day, and ultimately reached a peak of 5 responses per minute on the 20th day.
During the succeeding 5—day period, however, his rate again gradually declined to
relatively high levels of considerably less than 1 response per minute. Throughout
this entire period, the experimental animal of this pair maintainedalever-pressing
response rate of almost 20 responses per minute.

Measurement of the urinary excretion of total 17—hydroxycorticosteroids (17-
OH—CS) at selected stages during the experiment revealed slight increases in the
24-hour 17 -OH—CS output in both monkeys of each pair during the initial phases of
avoidance conditioning. Otherwise, the samples tested in subsequent phases of the
experiments showed no evidence of increased adrenal cortical activity, as judged
by the 24-hour 17-OH-CS excretion. Fluctuations outside the normal range which
may have occurred within individual 6-hour avoidance or rest periods cannot, how—
ever, be excluded by the data on 24—hour urine portions.

With the first pair of monkeys, the death of the avoidance animal after 23 days
terminated the experiment during one of the 6-hour avoidance periods. With the
second pair, the avoidance monkey again expired during one of the 6-hour "on-peri—
ods," this time 25 days after the start of the experiment. With the third pair in this
series, the death of the experimental animal again terminated the experiment during
one of the avoidance cycles, this time only9 days after initiation of the alternating
6-hour on-off procedure. And the experimental animal of the fourth pair of monkeys
was sacrificedin amoribund condition after 48 days on the avoidance procedure. In
all instances, gross and microscopic analysis revealed the presence of extensive
gastrointestinal lesions with ulceration as a prominent feature of the pathological
picture in the experimental animals. However, none of the control animals sacrificed
for comparison with their experimental partners and subjected to complete post-
mortem examination, showed any indications of such gastrointestinal complications.

The results obtained with this technique, while consistent with previous reports
of experimentally produced "psychosomatic" conditions (3), must be considered
only as the initial findings of a programmatic effort to systematically define the
variables of which this phenomenon may be a function. Follow-up studies, presently
in progress, strongly suggest that selection criteria for experimental and control
animals, relative degrees of "social contact" or isolation during the experiment,
and possibly even constitutional factors may playa critical role in the development
of gastrointestinal pathology as a consequence of such "behavioral stress."

THE EFFECTS OF DEPRIVAT‘I'ON UPON TEMPORALLY

SPACED RESPONDING

D.G. CONRAD, M. SIDMAN, AND R.J. HERRNSTEIN

Walter Reed A rmy Institute of Research

Spaced responding, or "timing," may be generated in a free-operant situation
by making reinforcement contingent upon the temporal spacing of responses (5). A
respOnse produces a reinforcement only if it is emitted after a fixed interval of
time has elapsed without a response. Responses that occur before the fixed inter—
val has elapsed are not reinforced, but, rather, reset a timer which starts the
timing interval over again.

Differential reinforcement of low response rates (DRL), by selective reinforce-
ment of spaced responses, yields a characteristic frequency distribution of inter-
response times (IRT's) (3, 4). Frequency distributions of IRT's typically rise gradu-
ally to a mode at about the minimum inter-response interval that is required for
reinforcement, and decline gradually at longer intervals. A gradient of generali-
zation along atemporal dimension may be described by the relative frequency dis-
tribution of IRT's shorter than the minimum interval required for reinforcement.
All IRT's greater than the minimum necessary for reinforcement are reinforced.
The declining frequencies of these long IRT's, therefore, are under the control of
a different variable than the generalization gradient. Anger ( 1) has shown that the
decline in frequency of long IRT's is related to the reduction which they produce
in the number of reinforcements possible within a given period of time, i. e., the
rate of reinforcement.

The study to be reported here is an investigation of the effects of deprivation
and progressive satiation upon performance in the DRL situation.

SUBJECTS AND APPARATUS

The subjects were five adult albino rats and a rhesus monkey. During each ex-
perimental session the animals were confinedin metal boxes which contained levers
that closed a microswitch and activated the control and recording apparatus when
depressed. A motor-driven cup delivered the liquid reinforcement at appropriate
times. A 6—watt lamp illuminated the cup when it was in the raised position. White
noise ‘in the experimental room masked auditory cues from the operation of the
control and recording apparatus located in a separate room.

Responses and reinforcements were recorded on electrical impulse counters,
and a cumulative-response recorder provided continuous records of lever-pressing.

A system of timers and counters automatically tabulated inter-response times in
class intervals of 2 seconds and primed the reinforcement circuit at appropriate
times.

PROCEDURE
General Training

Each animal received 2-hour training sessions daily. Each rat was given access
to water for 1/2 hour following each experimental session. A reinforcement for the
. rats consisted of a drop of water. Purina chow pellets were continuously available
" in their home cages. The monkey, whose reinforcement was 1 milliliter of sweetened
orange juice, received its daily food ration of bread, chimp crackers, lettuce, ba—
nana, apple, and carrot after its experimental session. It was given no liquid other
than that contained in the diet and the reinforcements of orange juice.

The animals first learned to lever-press for continuous reinforcement. Then
they were trained on the timing procedure in which only those responses were re-
inforced which occurred after at least 20 seconds without a response. This differ-
ential reinforcement of low rates was continued until the average response rate
per session and inter—response time distributions for each animal showed no con—
sistent change from day to day.

Variation of Deprivation

In the first part of the experiment the effects of a range of deprivation periods
were studied. After the daily response rates and distributions of IRT's had stabil-
ized for Rat GF-72 and Monkey R-lO, they were each given a 2-hour test session
once a week. The deprivations used for Rat GF—72 were: 9.0, 15.5, 21.5, 45.5,
and 69.5 hours. The monkey was deprived for 0, 3, 7, 24, and 72 hours. Both
animals were given three test sessions after each of the five periods of depri-
vation, with the deprivation periods varied from test to test in a mixed order. Be-
tween weekly tests the animals continued to receive their daily training sessions,
after 21. 5 hours of deprivation, except when such a session would have occurred
during the period of deprivation being tested.

Responses, reinforcements, and frequency distributions of IRT's were recorded
for each test session. The three test sessions at each deprivation were summated
and treated as one in analyzing the results.

Progressive Satiation

In the second part of the study a different technique of manipulating the subjects'
state of deprivation was used in order to determine whether the results obtained
from the preceding technique would be confirmed. The animals first were deprived
for a long period of time, and then were permitted to remain in the DRL situation
until the accumulation of reinforcements brought them to states progressively ap-
proaching satiation.

The subjects were Rats AC-23 and AC-25. After stable performances on the
DRL were obtained, they were given 3 days (approximately 69. 5 hours) of water
deprivation followed by a 10-hour test session. Total responses, reinforcements,
and frequency distributions of IRT's were recorded over successive 2-hour peri-
ods during the 10-hour session.

 




    

    

TEMPORALLY SPACED RESPONDING

Limited Hold

In the final part of this study, "timing" behavior under more stringent con-
ditions of reinforcement was investigated. An upper limit was imposed upon the
time interval after which a response could be reinforced (2); that is, after the
minimum interval had elapsed, reinforcement was possible for only a brief peri-
od of time. Responses which occurred either before the minimum interval had
elapsed or after the "limited hold" had elapsed were not reinforced. All unreine
forced responses reset the DRL timer, starting the timing interval again.

Rats AK-8 and AK-ll were subjects in the DRL limited-hold experiment. They
were first trained in the DRL procedure with no maximum limit on the duration of
IRT's reinforced. All responses which were emitted any time after 20 seconds of
no-responding had elapsed were reinforced. The rats were then trained withthe
limited-hold contingency of reinforcement added to the DRL. At first, only IRT's
between 20 and 40 seconds were reinforced. The only effect of IRT's longer or
shorter than these limits was to reset the DRL timer, starting the timing interval
again. The duration of the hold was then reduced by gradual steps. Rat AK-ll was
eventually able to perform consistently with a limited hold of only 2 seconds. The
only responses reinforced were those emitted after a pause of 20 to 22 seconds.
The behavior of AK-8, however, Was not maintained withahold less than4 seconds.
When a 2-second hold was attempted, AK-8 ceased responding entirely. Therefore,
this rat was tested with the 4-second limited hold. Those responses which occurred

after pauses of 20 to 24 seconds were the only ones reinforced. After their limited- '

hold behavior stabilized, each rat was deprived of water for 3 days and then given
a 10-hour test session.

RESULTS

With those animals whose deprivation"

was varied, the response rate increases
sharply at the lower deprivations, and then
RAT $-72 more slowly as the hours of deprivation
increase (Fig. l). The progressive-Sat—

The IRT distributions for the limited-hold animal‘s appear in Fig. 4, with the shaded
portions of the distributions indicating the relative frequencies of reinforced IRT's.
Peak frequencies occur prior to the reinforced intervals. The effect of approaching
satiation takes place rapidly for both animals. The distribution of IRT's between
the sixth and eighth hours of the session for AK-8, just before it ceases responding,
is somewhat flattened and the frequencies of longer intervals are beginning to in-
crease. 0n the other hand, the effect on AK—ll's distribution of IRT's is almost
missed. The peak of this animal's distribution is just beginning to deteriorate be-
tween the eighth and ninth hours of the session. The frequencies of long IRT's have
increased, and short IRT's, except for those less than 2 seconds ("bursts"), have
disappeared. Responding ceases completely after 8. 5. hours.

A large proportion of IRT's are less than 2 seconds. Although such "bursts" of
responding can also be observed in the monkey's distributions, they are much less
frequent. These "bursts" are typically produced by rats, pigeons, and monkeys in
the DRL situation, yet little is known to explain them adequately. There has been
some indication that they are related to the timing process, since the probability
of their occurrence was shown to be the highest after IRT's just short of the mini-
mum required for reinforcement (3).

The systematic changes that occurred
in the IRT distributions are brought out by
>30 SEC RAT GF—72 an analysis of the percentages of long
(greater than 30 seconds) and short (less
than 10 seconds) IRT's. In calculating
these percentages, the IRT's less than
2 seconds were not included. Figure 5
shows that the percentage of short IRT's

60 70 1y from 45 per cent after 9 hours' depri-
vation to 9 per cent after 21.5 hours' de—
privation. At the two longer deprivations
the percentage of long IRT's continues to
decrease slightly. A similar analysis of
the distributions for the monkey yields
similar results.

the percentage of long and short IRT's.

The decreases in rates of responding are closely related to the increasing per-
centage of long IRT's after the short periods of deprivation. The lower response
rates correlated with increases in the frequencies of long IRT's are associated
with increases in the percentage of responses reinforced, even though there are
fewer total reinforcements.

With the progressive-satiation animal, AC—25 (Fig. 6), the percentage of IRT's
less than 10 seconds remains constant at about 9 per cent for the first 5 hours of
the session, and then shows an increase to 20 per cent before the rat ceases re-
sponding. The percentages of IRT's over 30 seconds are also fairly constant, re—
maining under 5 per cent for the first 5 hours, but then increasing to 34 per cent

10 hours, also did not show the rise in percentage of long IRT's.

Figure 7 illustrates similar trends for the limited-hold animals. The percentage
of IRT's under 10 seconds remains relatively constant, under 5 per cent, for as
long as lever-pressing is maintained by Rat AK—8. The long IRT's, however, in—
crease from under 5 per cent after the first hour to nearly 24 per cent after the
seventh hour, with the greatest change toward the end. For AK—ll, IRT's less
than 10 seconds remain under 2per cent throughout. The long IRT's are also under
2 per cent except at the very end when they increase to 9 per cent.

SUMMARY

/

/,/ Five rats and a rhesus monkey were trained to space their responses at least

{ 20 seconds apart. The performances of the monkey and one rat were tested after

‘ five periods of deprivation ranging from zero to 72 hours and 9 to 69. 5 hours, re—
spectively. Two rats received a 10-hour test session during which the accumu-
lation of reinforcements produced satiation. Two other rats were trained to space
their responses by at least 20 seconds but not more than 24 seconds. The last two
animals were also tested in a 10-hour satiation session.

In all cases the major effect upon performance of manipulating deprivation in
the DRL situation was observed to occur only after short deprivations or when the
animals were near satiation. With greater satiation, long IRT's became more fre-
quent and response rates dropped. Over a wide range of deprivations, little change
in the performance could be detected.

A SIMPLE WAY TO RECORD LATENCIES

A simple and space—saving way to record latencies automatically for either a
large number of subjects simultaneously or for one subject during successive time
periods can be arranged by using a multivibrator and Sodeco counters. The multi-
vibrator can be made to pulse a large number of counters which can be individually
controlled again by a relay for each counter. The Grason-Stadler pulse former
E783F can be easily adapted for this purpose. If a BOO-microfarad condensor is
wired parallel with the 100-microfarad condensor in the unit, it pulses at a rate of
10 pulses per second, making the latency readings accurate to t 0. 1 second. The
Sodeco counter can handle 25 pulses per second and does not wear after 1 week of
continuous Operation. '

THE BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF SOME TEMPORALLY

DEFINED SCHEDULES OF REINFORCEMENT

E LIOT HE ARST

Columbia University2

The differences in behavioral effects between interval and ratio reinforcement
have been pointed out by several investigators (1, 6, 9, 15), and reveal themselves
most clearly in comparisons of over-all response rates, temporal patterns of
cumulative-response curves, and subsequent extinction responding. In view of the
different procedures followed by the experimenter and these contrasting behavioral
effects, most researchers have regarded the two categories as basically distinct.

Skinner (15) has given a plausible explanation of why differences in behavior
emerge from the two types of schedule. On interval schedules, long inter-response
times (IRT's) are more likely to be reinforced than short IRT's, and this fact may
account for the relatively low rates characteristic of interval reinforcement. On
ratio schedules, however, rapid rates of responding will be more frequently rein—
forced than low rates, so that short IRT's have agreater probability of reinforce—
ment than they would on acomparable interval schedule. Thus, the higher response
rates obtained with ratio reinforcement may result from this contingency.

Several studies have shown that IRT distributions do, in fact, change, depending
on the relative reinforcement of different IRT's. (Actually, of course, it is the re—
sponse which terminates the IRT that is "reinforced.") Wilson and Keller (18), for
example, found that reSponse rates decreased as successively longer IRT's were
selectively reinforced, while Sidman (14), in studying the effects of certain drugs
on timing behavior, obtained IRT distributions which displayed peaks inthe region
of the minimum IRT reinforced.

Anger (1) has recently offered a further analysis of the effects of several dif-
ferent schedules on IRT distributions. He found that the probability of occurrence
of different IRT's on a variable-interval (VI) schedule was closely related to the
number of reinforcements per hour given each IRT class, rather than to the number

of reinforcements per IRT for each IRT class. This large degree of control by the
"reinforcements-per-hour" variable was surprising, particularly since its action
in favoring short IRT's was opposed by a relatively greater frequency of nonrein-
forcement of these IRT's. Confirming the studies mentioned above, Anger also
found that restriction of reinforcements to greater than 40-second IRT's resulted
in marked decreases in response rate compared to an equivalent VI without such
restriction.

Making use of some of these considerations and findings, Schoenfeld, Cumming,
and Hearst(13) have suggested that both interval and ratio effects may be obtained
within a single general framework which involves the manipulation of temporal
variables only. The terms tD and tA were used to refer, respectively, to time peri-
ods during which (a) reinforcement may be given and (b) reinforcement is never
given. The simplest cases arise where tD and tA are held constant and are alter-
nated, and only the first response in tD is reinforced. 3

Figure 1 illustrates, for a typical case, the relationships among tD, tA, the
organism's responses, and the reinforcing stimulus (SR). In this example, tD and
tA are held constant at 10 and 20 seconds, respectively, and the total 90-second
sample includes three complete cycles. (Each cycle consists of one tD and one tA
period.) Clearly, reinforcements can be "missed" on such a schedule; if no re—
sponse occurs during a tD period, the animal does not receive a reinforcement

during that cycle. (Note Cycle 2.)

Two variables, which form the basis of the proposed classification of reinforce—
ment schedules, can be derived from the foregoing definitions and restrictions on

the use of tD and tA. Changes in either tD or tA affect both the total cycle length
(tD + tA) and the proportion of the cycle during which a response may be reinforced
EtD/(tD+ tA)], he_n_ceforth to be abbreviated T. (In Fig. 1, the cycle length_ is
30 seconds, while T is 0.33.) Manipulation of these factors, cycle length and T,
permitted the mapping of an experimental domain which included sectors expected
to yield behavioral effects typical of responding under several interval and ratio
schedules as ordinarily defined.

The usefulness of this sort of analysis has already been subjected to some ex-
perimental st_udy. Schoenfeld and Cumming (12,13) found that decreases in cycle
length, with T held constant, led to sharp increases in the key- pecking rates of
pigeons for grain reinforcement. These rate increases were accompanied by changes
in the temporal patterns of cumulative-response curves from ones resembling fixed-
interval (FI) performance to those resembling random-ratio. An interesting follow-
up involved the exposure of one subject to 6 days of extinction subsequent to its
training on the several cycle lengths. Not too surprisingly, the extinction curves
showed a blending of characteristics, some typical of extinction responding after
a history of interval reinforcement and others typical of curves after a ratio his-
tory.

Within this context the present study sought to examine the behavioral effects
of changes in T while the cycle length was held constant, or, to paraphrase, to in—
vestigate the effects of variations in the length of a "limited_hold" superimposed
on an F1 schedule of reinforcement. Successive reductions in T(with cycle lengths
of reasonable duration) would be expected to favor the emergence of a high response
rate, since on such schedules reinforcement is likely to be more frequent following
short IRT's than long IRT's. If the use of ratio schedules is considered to be a rela-
tively crude way of select_i_vely reinforcing high rates of responding, as was sug-
gested earlier, then small T values may generate effects typical of fixed- ratio (FR)
and some variable— rat1o _(_VR) schedules. In the present experiment, the effects of
successive decreases in T from i_t_s maximum value of 1. 00 were examined. From
the arguments above, and since at T = 1. 00 the schedule is FI timed by the "clock,"4
this procedure was expected to produce changes from FI to ratio performance.

METHOD
Subjects

Four barren White Carneaux hen pigeons approximately 7 years old were the
subjects. All were maintained at about 80% (t 15 grams) of their normal or free-

feeding weight throughout the study and had not been used in any experiments be-

fore the present one.
Apparatus

The experimental box in which all subjects were separately run has been de-
scribed in detail by Ferster (4, 5). The response measured was key-pecking, and
a 3-second presentation of grain defined a reinforcement.

Most of the necessary programming and recording devices were operated by
relay circuits. A perforated-shutter arrangement was used to schedule tD and tA;

4 Ferster and Skinner (6) state that there is little practical difference between timing the
F1 from the last reinforcement or from the end of the previous interval ("by the clock"), since
FI schedules normally generate a substantial response rate at the time of reinforcement and
the reinforced response usually occurs within a second or two of the designated interval.

this apparatus provided a range of T values from 1. 00 down to less than 0.01. Re-
sponse data were taken in the form of cumulative-response curves, total number
of responses and reinforcements per session, and polygraph records of the tem—
poral distribution of response occurrences.

Procedure

The general design of the experiment involved the use of single animals as their
own controls, with stable behavior (defined below) at each value of the independent
variable as the criterion for moving the subject to another value.

Cycle length was held constant at 30 seconds for all values of T. Although the
birds were run 1/2 hour every day, only the data of the last 15 minutes of the session
were used for analysis in order to minimize warm-up effects.

A brief preliminary period permitted habituation to the experimental box, mag-
azine training, and differentiation of the key-pecking reSponse (4). The experiment
proper followed directly. First, each subject was run on a schedule whereT~ equalled
1. 00(tD : 30 seconds, tA = 0); this schedule is identical with a 30:_second FI timed
by the "clock." Thereafter, each bird was consecutively shifted toT values of O. 35,
O. 05, O. 03, 0.02, and O. 913. This order was used in preference to a randomized
sequence since the birds might extinguish rapidly, as with a high FR requirement,
if placed on a very small T early in training.

As noted above, each bird was kept on a given schedule until its response rate
had stabilized, as defined by the following criterion. The first 7 days on any schedule
were not considered in computing stability. After the completion of the next 6 days
of running, the mean of the first 3 days of the 6 was compared with that of the last
3‘ days. If the difference between these means was less than 5% of the total 6—day
mean, the bird was said to have stabilized and was shifted to the next schedule. If
the difference between submeans was greater than 5% of the grand mean, however,
another experimental day was added and similar calculations made for that day and
the 5 immediately preceding it. Such extensions of the experiment and calculations
of stability were continued daily until the 5% criterion was achieved.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION5

The effects of variations in T can be analyzed in several ways. The arguments
advanced earlier would suggest that decreases in T are accompanied by important
changes in the over-all response rate and in responses per reinforcement, as well
as by changes in the appearance of cumulative-response curves and IRT distri—
butions. The data will be discussed in that order.

Figure 2 displays individual functions relating response rate to T. The plotted
rates are the means for the last 6 days on each schedule (stability days) and have
been corrected for eating time by subtracting the total amount of time the feeder
was available (3 seconds per reinforcement multiplied by the total number of rein—
forcements) from the 15-r_ninute test session. All birds exhibit a pronounced in-
crease in response rate as T decreases, with the greatest changes in slope occurring
at the lowest T values, i_.__e_., below 0.03.

sults and the outcome of several statistical tests, is available in the original dissertation which

Since the number of "missed" reinforcements increased as Tdecreased in value,
the large increments in response rate depicted in Fig. 2 occur in spite of a de-
crease in the over—all frequency of reinforcement. In fact, these sharp increases
in rate take place in the range of T's where the most sudden drOps in number of
reinforcements occur; from T of 1. 00 to T of 0. 03 the group mean number of rein-
forcements declines only slightly from 30. 3 to 27. 3 reinforcements per test ses-
sion, while below 0.03 there is a rapid decrease to 20. 4 and 18. 5 reinforcements
on the two smallest T's. This effect is mirrored in the data of the individual birds
as well.

This relationship raises the possibility that the rate increase associated with
low T values is an artifact resulting from a decline in the number of pauses after
reinforcement. An effort was made to correct for this possibility by subtracting
mean pause-after-reinforcement time from total time and then recalculating re—
sponse rates on this basis. Since some "pause" data was unavailable on the smallest
T used, this could only be done approximately, but the results revealed no impor-
tant changes. Examination of the IRT data, which are uncontaminated by pause-
time, also indicated that this factor was not a critical one (e. g., Fig. 5).

Individual curves of responses per reinforcement plotted against T are shown
in Fig. 3. The four curves exhibit the same relationship: a relatively small in-
crease down to a T value of 0.05 and a sharp positive acceleration with smaller
values of T.

Although these schedules are all programmed temporally, their effects do not
match those obtained on interval schedules, which are also programmed on a tempo-
ral basis. Several experimenters have found that rate of responding is directly
related to frequency of reinforcement on both fixed- (7, 15, 17) and variable- (3)

interval schedules (1. e., as the fixed or mean interval increases, response rate
falls off), while the opposite is true in the present finding. The particular contin-
gencies of the schedules used here, with their selective reinforcement of high rates,
especially on small T's, already have been suggested as having several charac-
teristics in common with ratio schedules. In both cases, as the requirements im-
posed on the organism become more stringent (i. e. ,successively higher FR's or
mean VR's, or, here, smaller and smaller T's), response rate increases, even
though the frequency of reinforcement decreases. Likewise, a rate increase ac-
companiesan increase in the number of responses per reinforcement on both con-
ventional ratio schedules (2,8) and the schedules investigated here.

The data presented thus far indicate that variables similar. to those under FR
and some VR specifications are controlling behavior on small T values, however,
on the larger T's, where very few reinforcements are "missed, " the controlling
variables are more like those under FI.

Qualitative differences in behavior also emerged as T was varied. Birds No. 3
a_nd No. 5, which consistently had the lowest response rates of the four subjects on
T va_l_ues below 0. 35, each exhibited signs of extinction or"strain"(2, 16) on certain
low T's; for Bird No.3 these characteristics occurred on the 0. 02value, and for
Bird No.5 they developed on a T of 0.013. Rates decreased noticeably during these
periods, with a resultant increase in the number of "missed" reinforcements.
Breaks after reinforcement were often unusually long, while the day-to-day vari—
ability in response rate was quite high and apparently was dependent on the number
of reinforcements obtainedin the first few minutes of each daily session. If a bird
received almost no reinforcements in the first 10 minutes, its rate was likely to
decrease radically in the latter half of the session. (Bird No. 3 once went almost

 




TEMPORALLY DEFINED SCHEDULES 51

20 minutes without a response on the 0. 02 value, despite over 5 previous months
of responding at a fairly high rate.) These irregularities in behavior are charac-
teristic, too, of the extinction—like behavior described by Skinner (16) and Boren
(2) as "strain" under conditions of very high FR's, where reinforcement is too in-
frequent to maintain a response at high strength. Just as one might avoid "strain"
in Boren's study by increasing the FR rather slowly, the same result might be
achieved here through the use of smaller successive decrements in T than were
actually used.

The evidence of "strain" shown in the data also supports the notion that the con-
trolling variables at low values of T are similar to those under ratio schedules. In
interval schedules, "strain" does not ordinarily occur, since any"tendency toward
extinction is opposed by the fact that when the rate declines the next reinforcement
is received in return for fewer responses" (16). This is likely to be the case for
higher values of T, e. g., 1. 00 and 0.35.

Individual cumulative-response curves (e. g. , Fig. 4) also showed distinct changes
asTdecreased in value. FOL Birds No. 1, 3, and 5 the scalloping typical of F1 rein—
forcement was apparent for T's of 1. 00 and 0. 35. (See also Fig. 5.) AtTvalues 0.03
and lower the records were marked by periods of responding at a very high and steady
rate, usually until reinforcement was delivered. Immediately after a reinforcement,
there characteristically was apause or "break" followed by an abrupt transition to
rapid responding. (See Fig. 5.) These properties are noted by Boren (3) and by
Ferster and Skinner (6) as common to FR response curves. On the lowest T values,
Birds No. 3and No. 5 typically showed periods of no responding interspersed with
periods of responding ata high rate (e. g., as in Fig. 4), afinding inagreement with
previous research on high "ratios" (6, 15).

The IRT data obtained in the present experiment are also worth some exami-
nation. These IRT's were measured from polygraph records taken on the last day
or two of each schedule and represent time intervals between two successive re-
sponse "starts" (depressions of the key); the only IRT's omitted from this sample
were those during which a reinforcement occurred. No IRT records were obtained
on the 0. 013 schedule for any bird nor on the 0.02 schedule for Bird No. 1.

A study of the frequency of different IRT's showed that the shortest IRT class,
0-0. 4 second, increased in relative frequency as T decreased. All other IRT classes
decreased in relative frequency with decreases in T.

Anger (1) points out that "relative frequency" as an estimate of the probability
of occurrence of a given IRT may not always be the most revealing measure, since
it does not take into account the fact that responses have many more opportunities
to occur after short intervals than after long intervals; any response after a short
interval removes the opportunity for a response after a long interval. Anger cor—
rected for this difference in Opportunities by calculating the number of IRT's as a
fraction of the number of opportunities for such IRT' s, the "number of IRT' s/ number
of opportunities" (IRT's/ ops). This index is an estimate of the probability of re—
sponse during a certain time interval given an opportunity for response in that in-
terval. The IRT's/ ops data of the present experiment indicated that on the highest
T values (i.e., 1.00 and 0. 35) the separate IRT classes did not differ much in
IRT's/ ops; but, as T decreased, shorter IRT's became increasingly more likely
than long IRT's. (Compare 11.)

TEMPORALLY DEFINED SCHEDULES I 53

The IRT distributions of the present experiment were analyze__d 1n one other way.
To find out whether the decrease' 1n mean IRT over the range of T held both for re-
sponses immediately after reinforcements and responses just before reinforce-
. ments, the first four IRT's following reinforcement (initial rate) and the last four
lBT's preceding reinforcement (terminal rate) were separately tabulated for each
T value. A total of eight IRT's per cycle was chosen because almost every cycle
throughout the experiment contained at least 9 responses. Figure 5 presents the
results of this analysis for the group dat_a_. Both initial and terminal IRT' s 0- 0. 4- -sec-
ond increase in relative frequency as T decreases, while all longer IRT's remain
low in frequency and gradually decrease concomitantly with T. The terminal IRT
distribution 1s consistently above the initial at the short IRT's and below the initial
at the long IRT's; the percentage differences between the two functions, however,
become smaller at the lowest T's. Individual functions show essentially the same
relationships. That is what would be expected if ratio behavior were characteristic
of small T values, since abrupt transitions to maximal response rates following
pauses after reinforcement are normal under FR and VR. A more gradual accel-
eration of responding from its initial to its terminal value, possibly revealed in
the functions for T's of 1.00 and 0. 35, distinguishes the temporal discriminations
of F1.

Several lines of evidence have been presented which are in general agreement
with the implications of the proposed classification of reinforcement schedules
discussed earlier. The sharp changes suggested in the rate and response- per- -rein-
forcement data, the characteristics of the cu_r_nulative- -response curves, and the
differences in IRT distributions for different T values all support the notion that
important behavioral changes occur as a result of decreases in T and that these
changes represent a shift from F1 to ratio performance Though these conclusions
are strongly indicated, certain reservations must be kept in mind. Skinner (15, also
6) notes that at the higher frequencies of periodic reinforcement (i. e., short fixed
intervals), indirect correlations between rapid responding and reinforcement often

occur, and the combined result of these correlations is enough to produce curves
which more usually characterize FR. In the present experiment the fixed interval
was quite short, so that such indirect correlations possibly did take place. The
cumulative curves for Bird No. 2, for example, on T values of 1.00, 0.35, and
0.05, are marked by high rates and little of the scalloping ordinarily present in
F1 curves; the curves are more ratio-like than interval-like. The cumulative curves
for the other subjects did not, however, show these same characteristics, and the
pseudo- correlations of which Skinner speaks probably cannot account for the large
increases in rate which occurred as T decreased in value and more and more rein-
forcements were "missed." Research currently in progress with the same experi-
mental design as used here, but with appreciably longer cycle lengths, ought to
give a clearer picture of the interval-ratio relationship.

It is likely, too, that the behavior exhibited on small T values cannot be pre-
cisely equivalent to that displayed on ratio schedules as ordinarily defined, if only
because the animal, not the experimenter, here determines the "ratios" which are
reinforced. Also, several studies (e. g., 10) have indicated that factors other than
the differential reinforcement of high rates, frequency of reinforcement, and the
discriminative function of the reinforcing stimulus, all of which were emphasized
here, may also play a part in determining ratio performance. Even though subtle
differences may exist between schedules defined by response counts and by manip—
ulation of apprOpriate T values, the similarities in their effects are too numerous
to be minimized and suggest continuities between "interval" and "ratio" behavior
which are worth further investigation.

SUMMARY

In an attempt to show how both "interval" and "ratio" behavior may be obtained
within a single general framework which involves the manipulation of temporal vari-
ables only, some time-correlated operant schedules were systematically studied.
On these schedules, reinforcement was available for only a limited period (tD)
every 30 seconds; if a response did not occur within this limited period, no further
responses were reinforced (tA ) until the next such period was scheduled. The du-
ration of this "limited hold" (tD) was successively decreased throughout the ex-
periment and the behavioral effects observed. Four White Carneaux pigeons were
the subjects, while the response was key-pecking.

As the length of this limited period decreased:

(1) Response rates and responses per reinforcement increased, with the
sharpest increases occurring at the shortest "holds"; at these short holds the
greatest number of reinforcements was missed and two subjects evidenced "strain"
similar to that often obtained on high fixed ratios.

(2) The percentage difference between initial (immediately following rein-
forcement) and terminal (immediately preceding reinforcement) rates decreased,
with cumulative-response curves resembling "ratio" behavior appearing at short
hold values.

Conclusion

Variations in the duration of the limited hold led to a change from interval-like
behavior to behavior resembling that seen under ratio schedules. The data agree
substantially with the proposal that both types of effect may be observed within a
single framework of temporally defined variables.

NEW INK FOR CUMULATIVE RECORDERS

A new type of ink mixture has been found superior in our laboratory over the
Esterline-Angus ink and water mixture commonly used in Leeds & Northrup pens
for a Gerbrands Cumulative Recorder.

The mixture consists of two parts of Varian Recorder ink and one part of J. C.
Higgins "Eternal Black" drawing ink. The Higgins ink has a carbon base, which
makes it possible to thermofax cumulative records when this mixture is used. The
mixture is quicker-drying than the Esterline-Angus ink, but does not clog the ca-
pillary of the pen even when the recorder is not used for 12 hours.

A METHOD FOR OBTAINING PSYCHOPHYSICAL

THRESHOLDS FROM THE PIGEON

DONALD s. BLOUGH 1

National Institute of Mental Health

In several recent experiments, I have used a new and rather complex method
to measure the pigeon's absolute visual threshold. The published reports of these
studies (2, 3, 5, 6) include only brief summaries of this technique. The present pa-
per describes the method in detail and outlines the reasoning behind its various
aspects. For the sake of brevity and clarity, I do not attempt to discuss other ap—
plications of the technique. Also, I do not add to the previous apparatus descriptions
(2, 3, 5), except where such addition is necessary to clarify procedural details.

The method was suggested by Bekesy' s technique for tracing the human audi-
tory threshold (1). According to Bekesy' s procedure, the subject listens to a soft
tone. When the tone is audible, the subject presses a key. This causes an auto-
matic mechanism to diminish the intensity of the tone gradually. When the tone can
no longer be heard, the subject releases the key, whereupon the tone increases in
intensity until it is again audible. This process continues and the tone oscillates
up and down across the subject's threshold. A continuous chart of the tone's in-
tensity gives a graphic record of the threshold through time.

The novelty of Bekesy's method lies in the way that the subject's responses
govern the stimulus intensity. Equally important, however, is the control exerted
in the opposite direction: the stimulus intensity controls the subject's responses.
This "feedback" link in the psychophysical procedure will be my primary concern
in this paper. When I refer to"stimu1us control," I shall mean this influence which

j the stimulus has over the subject's responses.

In order to bring the behavior of animal subjects under stimulus control, I have
used operant-conditioning procedures developed by B. F. Skinner and his associ-
ates. Skinner's techniques are useful not only because they are effective in con-
trolling behavior, but also because the apparatus associated with these procedures
is automatic. Thus, it lends itself to a psychophysical method that involves automatic

I am indebted to Dr. Ratliff, who directed the thesis research and with whom I worked on other

stimulus variation. Furthermore, the enclosed chamber commonly used in operant-
conditioning research is ideal for the exact stimulus specification that is necessary
in a psychophysical experiment.

The present method combines the procedures of Bekesy and Skinner in the fol-
lowing way. The bird is reinforced for pecking one response key (key A) whenan il-
luminated stimulus patchis visible and another (key B) when the patch is dark. These
pecks control the intensity of the patch. Pecks on keyA reduce the intensity of the
patch;pecks on key B increase it. As a result, the stimulus intensity oscillates up
and down across the pigeon's threshold, and a continuous record of the stimulus
intensity gives a picture of the threshold, just as in Bekesy's procedure described
above. Figure 1 is a highly schematic picture of the apparatus. Figure 2 contains
some sample records that illustrate data obtained in single sessions. The threshold
is shown as a function of each of three independent variables.

The use of a single—response key, as in Békesy's original method, might appear
, to simplify the procedure just described. For example, a bird might be trained to
- peck a key only when the stimulus patch appears dark. Pecks would increase the
stimulus intensity. When the bird did not peck, the intensity would automatically
decrease. Such aprocedure has one overriding disadvantage: extraneous variables
tend to affect the level and variability of the threshold record to a greater degree
than when two response keys are used. If the bird stops pecking for some extrane-
ous reason, as it occasionally does, the intensity tends to be driven too low. Dep-
rivation, or reinforcement schedules that raise the response rate, would probably
yield a relatively high threshold. As I have argued in another context (4), although
two responses may complicate a behavioral analysis, they tend to give a clearer
picture of the momentary relation of responses to a stimulus. In the two-key situ-
ation, pauses in responding do not affect the threshold record, for stimulus intensity
remains unchanged during a pause. Variables known to affect response rate may
be expected in most cases to affect the two responses about equally. 2

STIMULUS CONTROL
Physical Stimulus Conditions

In a psychophysical experiment in vision, the subject's behavior is governed
partly by the physical nature of the apparatus. The apparatus is designed to favor
a high degree of stimulus control, while it keeps the stimulus at the subject's eye
as invariant as possible. In the present case, the pigeon is confined toa light-tight
experimental chamber. In order to reach the response keys and food magazine, the
bird must place its head through a circular aperture 4. 5 centimeters in diameter
(Fig. 1). This aperture keeps the bird's head directly in front of the stimulus patch
and at a fairly constant distance from the patch. The stimulus is located 4 centi—
meters beyond the response keys and is viewed through a rectangular aperture
above the keys. A silent shutter moves across the stimulus beam to turn the .stimu-
lus off. A motor-driven optical wedge in the beam varies the stimulus intensity.

Reinforcement Contingencies

The discrimination required of the pigeon is the same as that which a human
subject makes in a standard visual threshold experiment. In both cases, the subject's

2 These arguments hold for human subjects as well as pigeons. I have seen several examples
of visual data collected with Békésy's single-key method that show occasional very wide swings
in stimulus intensity when "the subject became inattentive."

responses are limited to two classes. Each gives one response(peck key A, "yes")
when he can see the stimulus, the other (peck key B, "no") when he cannot see the
stimulus. However, this stimulus control is maintained differently with pigeons
than it is with human subjects. With humans, verbal instructions given at the be—
ginning of a session usually suffice, although the experimenter may employ rein—
forcement(e. g., "right" or "good" following appropriate responses) if the subject's
discrimination is inadequate. With pigeons, reinforcement is used throughout each
session to establish and maintain stimulus control. Thus, it is necessary to super-
impose a reinforcement procedure upon the essentially simple psychophysical para—
digm. It is well to keep this dual nature of the method in mind during the following
discussion of reinforcement contingencies. No matter what reinforcement schedule
is operative, whenever the stimulus is "on" the bird's responses continuously ad-
just the stimulus intensity up and down. I shall discuss some details of this ad—
justment procedure after I have explained the scheme of reinforcement.

Basic Reinforcement Pattern. A trained pigeon makes one response (key A) when
the stim‘ulus patch is visible and another response (key B) when the patch appears
dark. The response in darkness is maintained by standard reinforcement proce—
dures, but two kinds of "darkness" must be distinguished. I shall use the term "below
threshold" to indicate that the stimulus is "on" (i. e. , physically illuminated) but is too
dim to be visible. The term "stimulus off"will be reserved for the case in which the
shutter is closed and no light whatever reaches the stimulus patch. By definition, the
pigeon cannot discriminate these two kinds of darkness. Thus, reinforcing responses
to keyB with food when the stimulus is off keeps the bird responding to keyB both
when the stimulus is off and also when it is on but below threshold. The bird is never
reinforced for pecking key B if the stimulus is on, even if it is below threshold.

 

Unfortunately, the response to key A cannot be maintained in the same fashion,
that is, by reinforcing it with food in the presence of a single intensity known to be
visible to the bird. This procedure will not work because birds can discriminate
lights of different intensities. If reinforced at only one intensity, they would become
less likely to respond to others. In order to keepabird pecking keyAinthe presence
of all super-threshold intensities, responses to all of these intensities have to be
reinforced. On the other hand, responses to key A must never be reinforced when
the stimulus is below threshold, and the threshold is unknown. One way to resolve
this difficulty is to choose a reinforcer that is ineffective when the stimulus is
below threshold but which becomes effective when the stimulus is above threshold.
In the present case, this reinforcer is the disappearance of the stimulus light.
Although the onset of darkness is not ordinarily a reinforcer for pigeons, it ac-
quires reinforcing properties here, because reinforcement with food occurs only
when the stimulus is off. Responding to key A is maintained by having key A re-
sponses turn off the stimulus. A "response chain" is set up. Pecks on key A turn
off the stimulus; when the stimulus is off, pecks on key B bring food.

The following, then, is the basic reinforcement sequence: stimulus on -—~ peck
keyA —-. stimulus off —- peck key B -—-ofood presented —- . . . repeat cycle . . . .
This pattern must be expanded and modified to allow time for variation in the
stimulus intensity, to maximize stimulus control, and to provide rapid and con—
tinuous responding over long experimental sessions. I shall describe these modi—
fications in the following paragraphs.

 




PSYCHOPHYSICAL THRE SHOLDS 35

Ratio Schedules. If a single response turned off the stimulus and another pro-
duced food (1. e., continuous reinforcement on both keys), several undesirable ef-
fects would follow. The bird would satiate rapidly, its response could not regulate
the intensity of the stimulus, and it could shut its eyes and achieve reinforcement
simply by alternating between the keys. Therefore, schedules of intermittent re—
inforcement on the two keys are necessary. '

 

The desirability of rapid responding and good stimulus control suggests the use
of a ratio schedule. Such a schedule, in which reinforcement is contingent upon a
certain number of responses, yields high rates of responding (7). Some of my pre-
liminary data also indicate that ratio schedules favor a high degree of stimulus
control, and Morse (8) has recently established this result experimentally.

It has been shown that birds can discriminate the number of responses that they
have made; and if they are reinforced on a short fixed ratio, they will tend to make
responses in bursts approximating the length of the ratio (7). In the present case,
this tendency would lead to the same difficulties as those just outlined for continu-
ous reinforcement: probable alternation of bursts on the two keys (regardless of
the stimulus), rapid satiation, and minimal control of the stimulus by the bird's
responses.

This condition is partially corrected by making reinforcement contingent upon
a varying, rather than a fixed, number of responses. The bird can not then tell
when to switch keys simply by "counting" its responses. Instead, it must look at
the stimulus light.

If an ordinary variable ratio were used on both the keys, however, the bird
could still get reinforcement by alternating between the keys, or by some other
response pattern unrelated to the stimulus light. For, if the bird receives rein-
forcement for (e. g.) five pecks on a key, ten pecks alternated between the keys
would produce the reinforcement. Alternation is less efficient, because half of
the pecks are ineffective; but with short ratios, that is a relatively small matter.

Two "Punishment" Contingencies. To overcome the difficulty just outlined, the

 

 

bird is "punished" for "false" responses. For this purpose, I have used two ar-

rangements that seem about equally good. In my earlier experiments, "false" re—
sponses (defined as pecks on key B when the stimulus is on and pecks on key A
when the stimulus is off) wiped out the effect of any preceding correct responses.
That is, if a bird made three correct responses out of a total of seven required
for reinforcement and then pecked on the wrong key, it had to start over again
when it returned to the correct key and peck all seven responses. According to the
alternative method, each false peck subtracts only one from the accumulated sum
of correct responses. Thus, the delay of reinforcement increases with the number
of false pecks, with the limitation that false pecks never increase the required
number of correct pecks beyond its initial value.

As a result of this procedure, patterns of responding unrelated to the stimulus
are unlikely to produce reinforcement. There is an exception to this conclusion,
however. If bursts of responses exceeding the maximum ratio occur in alternation
on the keys, reinforcement will follow. Although long ratios would reduce this
difficulty, the desirable length of the ratio is limited. The limit becomes evident
when one recalls that pecks on key A drive the stimulus patch dimmer, and that

 




36 DONALD S . BLOUGH

when the stimulus goes below threshold the well—trained bird will switch its pecking
to key B. The ratio required on keyA must not be so long that the bird's responding
to keyA is always cut off by the disappearance of the stimulus before the ratio can
be completed. 3

This limit on the ratio became a practical problem when, after long training,
one bird began to alternate long runs of responses on the two keys. The bird pecked
a swift series of responses on key A and then without pause continued its run on
key B, often regardless of the intensity of the stimulus. The bird's threshold began
to wander from the regular pattern established in previous sessions.

A characteristic of the bird's behavior suggested a way to cope with this diffi—
culty. The bird did not pause as it switched from key A to key B. It was as if the
bird did not "bother" to observe the stimulus patch, for the fact that the patch is
above and beyond the keys makes it difficult for the bird to observe the patch with-
out pausing between pecks. Birds under stimulus control peck in bursts interspersed
with pauses, during which they presumably look to see if the light is on or off. When
looking competes with pecking, looking is more likely to occur if pauses in pecking
are mandatory. Accordingly, a timer was introduced into the circuit which made
it impossible for pecks on key B to bring food if they followed pecks on key A by
less than about 0.2 second. If the stimulus was off when such pecks occurred, the
shutter opened and the stimulus came on again. Thus, if a bird did not pause as it
switched keys from A to B, not only did it not obtain food but also it had to start
responding on key A all over again in order to turn the stimulus off. Under these
conditions, the spurious chaining rapidly dropped out and stable thresholds were
re-established.

Additional Reinforcements on Key B. It would be well to recall at this point
that pecks on key A are reinforce-d— by closing the shutter, which turns off the
stimulus. Pecks on key B are reinforced with food only if the shutter is closed
and the stimulus is off. If the stimulus is on but below threshold, pecking on key B
does not bring food. Early in the development of the present method, I neglected
one contingency. After each food reinforcement, the shutter opened and the bird
was expected to peck the keys once again, depending on whether or not the stimu-
lus patch was visible. However, since the stimulus was on, the bird was never
reinforced for pecking key B at this time. It was always necessary to peck key A
first, in order to close the shutter. Thus, the bird soon came to peck only on key
A at this time, whether the stimulus patch was visible or not. To get rid of this
spurious discrimination, it was necessary to reinforce some responses on key B
immediately after reinforcement. In order to do this, I changed the control circuit
in such a way that the stimulus remained off (shutter closed) after about one rein-
forcement in every five. With this arrangement, the pigeon can get food again one
time in five by pecking a short ratio on key B immediately after eating. The stimu—
lus controls pecking at this time: if the stimulus is visible, the bird must peck key
A; but if it appears dark, pecking key B is likely to bring food immediately.

 

3 As this discussion implies, the method makes use of moment—to—moment variability in the
absolute threshold. If the threshold intensity were exact and unvarying, a single peck on key A
would send the stimulus below threshold and a peck on key B would send it above once more; a
bird under stimulus control would not completea ratio longer than one. Experiments with human
subjects show a systematic effect that probably has its counterpart in the present procedure: a
light of decreasing intensity disappears at a lower intensity than that at which a light of increasing
intensity first appears.

 




PSYC HOPHYSICAL THRE SHOLDS 37

 

Interval Schedule on Key _A_. Under the reinforcement schedules described up
to this point, birds He reinforced very frequently. Also, the stimulus is off a
relatively large proportion of the time. When the stimulus is off, the wedge that
regulates the stimulus intensity does not move and no data are collected. For
these reasons, an interval component is added to the reinforcement schedule in
effect on key A. Following most food reinforcements (those after which the stimulus
comes on), a variable—interval timer is started. While this timer is operating, no
amount of pecking will close the shutter or raise the food magazine. Pecking has
no effect other than to dim the stimulus (key A) or make it brighter (key B). When
the timer completes its cycle, the ratio schedules and "punishment" contingencies
described above become effective. Because the timer operates for an interval vary-
ing between 1 and 45 seconds, the bird never "knows"when its pecks begin to be ef-
fective. A discrimination based on time following reinforcement is thus prevented.

Feedback Clicks. Experience has indicated that higher rates of responding
are maintained if the effective response produces a characteristic stimulus "feed-
back." In the present situation, as an aid to discrimination, eachlkey produces its
own loud and characteristic "click" when it is pecked.

RESPONSE CONTROL OF STIMULUS INTENSITY

 

The goal of the foregoing reinforcement procedures is to make the pigeon peck
in sucha way that the stimulus intensity is adjusted back and forth across the bird's
absolute threshold. Whenever the stimulus is on, this adjustment proceeds without
interruption. Responses on key A reduce the stimulus intensity and responses on
key B increase it. Periodically, as determined by the reinforcement schedules,
pecks on key A turn off the stimulus. While the stimulus is off, the optical wedge
that adjusts intensity does not move. When the stimulus comes on after rein—
forcement, it has the same intensity that it had when it went off. The stimulus
also remains at a constant intensity when the pigeon does not peck. Thus, on the
data records a horizontal line indicates either that the bird did not respond or that
the shutter was closed during the period in question.

Pecks on the two response keys change the intensity of the stimulus patch by
means of a simple electromechanical system. The response keys operate relays.
These in turn control a small reversible motor, which moves a variable-density
optical wedge in the path of the stimulus beam. A rotary solenoid moves the shutter
across the optical path, producing the "off" condition of the stimulus. These move-
ments are of course silenced so that they can provide no discriminative cues for
the bird. -

Although the speed and magnitude of the stimulus changes do not seem to be very
critical, several considerations establish an optimal range for these factors. The
intensity should not change for too long following a given response, for the intensity
may wander further up and down than necessary, producing a record of variable
appearance. Also, stimulus control may be weakened if the consequences of a re—
sponse extend over too long a time.

Within a given time interval, the stimulus intensity will vary much or little,
depending on the characteristics of the optical wedge and the speed of the wedge
motor. The intensity must change quickly enough to keep up with any threshold
variations. A relatively high rate is also desirable, so that the disappearance of
the stimulus below threshold looks like its sudden disappearance when the shutter
closes. On the other hand, the intensity variation following a peck must notbe so

 




38 DONALD S . B LOUGH

great that the bird sends the stimulus below or above threshold with a very few
pecks. As in the case of an overly long ratio-reinforcement schedule, the bird in
this situation would have difficulty completing the necessary number of pecks on
key A before the disappearance of the stimulus wOuld cause it to switch to key B.

REVIEW OF PROCEDURAL DETAILS

The aim of the procedure is to produce a stimulus-intensity record that oscil—
lates up and down across the pigeon's absolute threshold. To achieve this, the bird
must peck key A when it sees the stimulus and key B when the stimulus appears
dark. When the stimulus is on, these pecks control the stimulus intensity; pecks
on keyA make it go down and pecks on keyB make it go up. On random schedules, '
key A pecks turn off the stimulus and then key B pecks bring food reinforcement.

Schedules of reinforcement are introduced on the two keys to maximize the con-
trol of the light stimulus over the bird's behavior, to minimize the influence of
other stimuli or contingencies, and to maximize the continuity and length of ex—
perimental sessions.

Aratio component added to the schedule increases response rate and improves
stimulus control. The ratio is variable to prevent discrimination based on the
number of responses emitted. False responses cancel the accumulation of correct
responses toward completion of the ratio. Stimulus control is improved by requiring
the bird to pause briefly as it switches from keyA to key B. Additional reinforce-
ments on key B reduce an undesirable correlation between a food reinforcement
and the subsequent correct key. A variable-interval component in the schedule on
keyA prevents rapid satiation and increases the proportion of stimulus "on" time.
Characteristic clicks from the two keys increase the response rate and aid the
discrimination. Several factors place bounds on the optimal rate of stimulus in—
tensity change.

Figure 3 summarizes a typical sequence of events between two food reinforce—
ments. The figure is divided by vertical lines into three "stages," the first while
the interval timer is operating, the second while the ratio on key A is being com-
pleted, and the third while the ratio on key B is being completed. For simplicity,
no instance is shown of "punishment" for failure to pause while switching from
key A to key B. Also, there is no case of additional reinforcement on key B. The
latter may be viewed as repetition of Stage 3. Arbitrary values illustrate the vari-
able-interval and variable-ratio schedules.

THE METHOD IN USE
Preliminary Training

Preliminary training, like the initial "shaping"of a response, is largely "played
by ear." It is a matter of gradually introducing the bird to new conditions and more
difficult schedules. It is possible to specify the training steps only approximately,
because individual birds adapt and learn at different rates. In the following para-

graphs, I shall describe the training procedureI have followed with several birds. 7’

The pigeon was first starved to about 70% of its free-feeding weight. On its first
day in the experimental box, the bird found grain in the brightly lighted magazine.
After one or two sessions, the bird had learned to come and eat as soon as the
magazine was raised. Next, the bird was trained to peck the keys; a peck on either
key turned on the magazine light and lifted grain within reach for about 5 seconds.

STAGE I STAGE 2 STAGE 3

Fig. 3. A simplified diagram of events between two food reinforcements. During Stage 1,
the variable timer Operates (line 1), and pecks (pips on lines 2 and 3) serve only to change the
stimulus intensity (line 8). In Stage 2, the interval timer has stopped, and key A pecks accumu-
late to the total required (in this case, 7) to close the shutter. The double row of numbers in
line4 indicates the momentary sum of these pecks. Keprecks subtract from this sum. Stage 3
begins with shutter closure and continues until key B pecks have accumulated to the total re-
quired (in this case, 10) to bring food. Key A pecks subtract from this sum. The intensity
record does not change during Stage 3 or during presentation of food.

After about 50 reinforcements had been delivered, the stimulus patch, previously
dark, was strongly illuminated. A peck on keyA now turned off the stimulus; a peck
on key B when the stimulus was off brought food for 5 seconds. After the bird had
eaten, the stimulus usually reappeared and the cycle was repeated. However, after
an average of one reinforcement in five, the stimulus remained off; the bird had
only to peck key B to be reinforced again. The bird quickly learned to peck key A
when the stimulus was on and key B when it was off.

Up to this point, two lights other than the stimulus patch were used. One ("house
light") illuminated the box, and the other ("magazine light") illuminated the grain
from below during reinforcement. During the remainder of preliminary training,
these two lights were first made red, then dimmed, and finally extinguished. The
intensity of the stimulus was also slowly reduced.

The reinforcement schedules were introduced gradually. The number of pecks
required on each key was raised to two or three, then increased further. After
these ratios had been built up and the "punishment" contingencies introduced (see
above), the interval schedule on key A was initiated and its length gradually in—
creased.

The final step was to place the stimulus intensity under the control of the bird's
responses. This was done after about 16 daily sessions of 30 minutes to 2 hours.

 




40 DONALD S . BLOUGH

The bird was now working under the conditions described in the earlier sections
of this paper. It was allowed to practice until its threshold records became stable,
and then experimentation began. During experiments, the bird's response rate
gradually increased and it received more reinforcement. As this improvement
occurred, the ratio and interval schedules were correspondingly lengthened.

Values of Parameters

In describing the method in the preceding pages, I have introduced a number of
experimental parameters. As I have suggested, most of these parameters appear
to have an optimal range of values. The following values are ones that I have found
effective in birds that have had considerable experimental experience.

....~ ' ‘.

Deprivation: 75 to 85% of free-feeding weight, plus at least 1 day hungry.

Duration of food—magazine cycle: 2 to 5 seconds depending on bird.

Key A schedule: variable interval, mean 15 to 30 seconds ;plus variable
ratio, mean 4 to 8 responses.

Key B schedules'variable ratio, mean 9 responses.

Delay required between pecks on A and pecks on B: O. 25 second.

Proportion of reinforcements repeated without turning on stimulus: 1 re—
peat to 4 nonrepeat (programmed randomly).

Duration of stimulus change per single peck: about 0. 3 second.

Intensity change per peck: about 0.02 log unit.

I should emphasize that I have not attempted to study systematically the effects of
varying these parameters. The values listed were arrived at by trial and error.
To some extent, it seems advisable to use different values for different birds.

Therefore, although these values have worked in practice, they all may not be
optimal.

Difficulties and Remedies

Hanan/I

Symptom: £12 Responding. As in other operant—conditioning work a major cause _
of failure to respond appears to be insufficient deprivation. Without special training, E
birds tend to roost in the dark, so that the use of high deprivation (e. g., 70%) is '
advisable, at least in early sessions. An overweight bird often fails to start re- 71,...”
sponding in the apparatus, or prolonged pauses in responding occur during the ex-
perimental session.

Insufficient reinforcement is a second cause of failure to respond. The birds .=
learn to eat in the dark with varying degrees of efficiency. One of my birds regu- f
larly gained weight when its only food was obtained during an hour's session. A '
bird that gained little weight during experimental sessions and paused frequently
during its runs was much improved when it was given access to the food magazine
for twice as long as the other birds.

A schedule of reinforcement adequate for one bird may result in extinction with
another. This variability can be largely attributed to variations in individual re:
sponse rates. Arapidly responding bird obtains more reinforcements thana slowly
responding one. Thus, a slowly responding bird may require shorter interval and
ratio schedules.

Symptom: Wandering Threshold. How does one know when the stimulus loses
control and the bird's record wanders from the "true" threshold? One indication
is amarked departure from the threshold picture established in previous runs, or

 

 




PSYC HOPHYSIC AL THRE SHOLDS 41

earlier in the same run. A good way to detect a loss of stimulus control is to in-
crease or decrease the intensity of the stimulus by a known amount and see if the
bird adjusts its intensity control to compensate for the change. Figure 4a shows
a sample record obtained during dark adaptation in which a O. 7-log unit filter was
placed in the optical path at the point indicated by the arrow. In this case, the bird
promptly increased the intensity by just 0. 7 log unit, compensating for the filter
and indicating that the stimulus was in control. Figure 4b shows that this pro—
cedure had no effect on the record of a bird that was not under stimulus control
and was working well below its previously established threshold. Note also the
great variability of this record, another indication of loss of control.

My approach to the correction of the "wandering threshold" has been twofold.
First, Ihave tried to increase the influence of the stimulus over the bird's re-
sponding. Second, recognizing that a stimulus near threshold intensity may never
acquire very powerful control, I have tried to balance the tendencies to respond to
each of the two keys, so that weak stimulus control will be sufficient to determine
which response will be made. These two approaches are, of course, not entirely
separable, but involve differences in emphasis.

In my experience the pigeon rarely peeked the keys in sucha way that the stimu-
lus intensity wandered above the threshold established by previous runs. This con-
dition may be considered the result of an overbalance of pecking on key B. It has
occurred once or twice when the reinforcing mechanism broke down and the bird
began to extinguish. As would be expected, responding to key A dropped out first
under extinction, presumably because it is the farthest removed from food rein-
forcement. A similar result has occurred when the bird received relatively little
reinforcement because too many correct responses were required. This situation
was corrected by shortening the interval and ratio schedules on key A.

42 DONALD S . BLOUGH

The case in which the pigeon pushes the stimulus intensity below threshold has
occurred more frequently. Here, responding on key A is no longer under stimulus
control, for it occurs when the patch "appears dark." This situation arises when
the schedule is "too easy." That is, the bird obtains reinforcement followinga more
or less random series of pecks unrelated to the stimulus patch. The stimulus tends
to run to low intensities in this case, because relatively more key A pecks occur
when the stimulus is on and the intensity is changing. This is true because key A
pecks turn off the stimulus, while key B pecks turn it on.

When the threshold wanders downward, the following procedures may help.

(1) Increase the length of the interval, orthe ratio, or both, effective
on key A. This makes reinforcement less likely to follow a short run on key A.

(2) Increase the length of pause required when the bird shifts from key
A to key B. This may help to re-establish an "observing response."

(3) Increase the proportion of times when the stimulus remains off after
a reinforcement. It will be recalled that in this case, pecking key B brings rein-
forcement again immediately. This procedure strengthens the key B response re-
lative to the key A response and thus tends to push the intensity up.

APPLICABILITY OF THE METHOD

The present method, with appropriate modifications, appears to be applicable
to a variety of animal subjects and sense modalities. There are limitations, how—
ever, to the types of psychophysical problem that may be studied. Briefly, the
method is applicable, in principle, to problems where: (1) the stimulus can be
varied on some physical continuum, and (2) values of the stimulus fall into two

classes, one of which is not discriminable from some stimulus Sx. When the method
is applied, one class of responses is primarily reinforced (e. g., with food) in the
presence of Sx and another class is reinforced secondarily by producing Sx. The
resulting measure might be called the "threshold of equivalence." To stimuli along
the continuum on one side of this threshold, the subject gives the same response
as to Sx. To stimuli along the continuum on the other side, a different response
occurs.

Both absolute and differential thresholds may be studied as special cases of this
"threshold of equivalence." For the absolute threshold, Sx is "stimulus off," and
the class not discriminable from this includes stimuli below threshold intensity.
Other examples following this paradigm are critical flicker frequency (Sx is a
"steady light") and certain acuity measures (e. g., the stimulus continuum is the
breadth of a line, and Sx is "line absent"). For differential thresholds, such as
those for pitch, wavelength, or intensity, the stimulus has two parts. At Sx, the
parts are physically equal. The stimulus varies along a continuum from greater
to lesser inequality between the two parts. 4

4 For example, to find a pigeon's differential threshold for color, one side of a split field
might be held ata constant wavelength, while the bird's responses varied the other side in small
wavelength increments. Pecks on keyAwould decrease the difference between the sides, while
pecks on key B would increase the difference. If small enough increments were used, the bird
would not drive the stimuli to physical equality, but would cause the wavelength of the variable
side to oscillate around the "threshold of equivalence." On random schedules, pecks on key A
would produce equal fields (Sx), and then pecks on kewaould bring food. Two thresholds could
be obtained, one above and the other below the constant wavelength.

 




PSYCHOPHYSICAL THRE SHOLDS 43

Many psychophysical problems may be reduced to the determination of a "thresh-
old of equivalence" along a particular "attribute" of a stimulus. For example, one
may ask within what range of intensities a green stimulus has the same brightness
as a red stimulus. Acting under instructions, a human subject "abstracts," "attends
to," or "is under the control of" primarily the brightness of the stimulus. As a
result of his instructions, the subject excludes the discriminable "color" aspect.
The presentmethod does not have this effect. It applies only if one class of stimuli
is indistinguishable in all respects from a reinforced stimulus Sx. The reinforce-
ment contingencies that. serve as the animal's "instruction-s" invite it to use all
available cues, though care is taken to make the appropriate stimulus continuum
the only effective source of these cues.

This does not mean that reinforcement techniques cannot be applied to prob-
lems in animal psychophysics that require "selective attention." There is much to
be done. The fundamental methodological problem at present appears to be a fur-
ther refinement of our methods of stimulus control. We also need continued be-
havioral analysis of that fascinating hodgepodge involving "abstraction,” "concept
formation," and "attention."

TENSION -GAUGE

Atension-gauge originally designed to measure spring tension of relay springs
has been found the simplest way to measure and adjust the tension of rat levers and

SOME FACTORS INVOLVED IN THE STIMULUS

CONTROL OF OPERANT BEHAVIOR

W.H. MORSE AND B. F. SKINNER

Harvard University

The stimuli which are present when an operant is reinforced modify the subse-
quent frequency of emission of the response. For example, if a hungry pigeon is
reinforced with food when it pecks a translucent key upon which a monochromatic
light is projected, it will subsequently peck most rapidly when the light is of the
same wavelength. Guttman(3) has reported that a difference of 2 millimicrons can
producealower rate. As the difference increases the rate falls in a "generalization
gradient." If responses are reinforced at one wavelength and extinguished at all
others, the gradient is sharpened. These facts are now well known, but the signifi-
cance of the relevant conditions has not been fully analyzed.

When aresponse is reinforced in the presence of a stimulus, the stimulus (SD),
the response (R), and the reinforcement (r__f_t) occur in close temporal proximity,
as the result of certain arbitrary arrangements. At first, SD usually has no de-
monstrable control over the response, it does not elicit the response as in a reflex
and is chosen from many possible stimuli. The relation between R and rft is ar—
ranged by the reinforcing circuit. Once these two connections have bee-En established,
there is a fairly close temporal contiguity between SD and rft. But which of these
relations is responsible for the stimulus-generalization gITa—dient (with or without
differential reinforcement)? In particular, is the role of the response in bringing
S and rft close together essential to the development of stimulus control, or is
the temporal association between SD and _r__ft enough to make anyR which produces
r__f_t more frequent in the presence of SD.

This point has been the subject of several experiments. K. Walker(5) has shown
that a discriminative stimulus developed in connection with one operant has an ap-
propriate effect upon another. The introduction of a tone which had been the dis-
criminative stimulus for a running response facilitated lever-pressing. Estes (1)
reinforced pressing a lever on a fixed-interval schedule, then removed the lever
and repeatedly presented a stimulus for 60 seconds before the "free" presentation
of food. When the levers were replaced and the response extinguished, a higher
rate was observed in the presence of the stimulus which had preceded the presen-
tation of food. In that experiment the response was conditioned before the con-
tingency between the stimulus and food was set up. In a later experiment (2), a

stimulus preceded food before the lever was introduced. The rat was then rein-
forced for 10 responses to the lever and, subsequently, on afixed-interval schedule
for 1 hour. When the stimulus was then introduced during extinction, it increased
the rate of responding as in the previous experiment.

A similar experiment differing in several significant features has been per-
formed with pigeons. In a first stage a food magazine is operated on an intermittent
schedule in the presence of one stimulus but never in the presence of another. In a
second stage the pigeon is conditioned to peck a key for food, with neither stimulus
present, and a substantial rate is built up with intermittent reinforcement. In the
final stage the response is extinguished while the two stimuli are alternately pre-
sented. Under these conditions the stimuli were found to exert a differential control
over the rate.

APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE

All inside surfaces of a standard experimental box with inside dimensions of 11
by 10 by 13 inches high were painted a uniform flat white. The space was illumi-
nated by a ceiling light which could be white, red, or green. The magazine pre-
sented food for 5 seconds at each operation; a supply of water was present.

Stage 1

Four naive male pigeons were reduced to 80% of their free-feeding body weight.
Each bird was then placed in the box for daily sessions of 144 minutes each. The
light in the box was alternately red and green for periods which varied between 6
and 300 seconds, with a mean of 120 seconds. In the presence of one color (red .
with two pigeons, green with two) the food magazine was operated (without respect ,
to the bird's behavior) on a 1-minute, variable-interval schedule. In the presence
of the other color the magazine was never operated. There was no explicit period
of "magazine training," but by the second daily session all the birds ate from the 4
magazine whenever it appeared. There were 20 such experimental. sessions for ,

each bird.

Stage 2

A key consisting of a hinged plastic plate behind a 1-inch circular opening at
head height in one wall of the box was illuminated only by the ceiling light. In white
light all birds were conditioned to peck the key and reinforced 72 times a day for
2 days. They were then reinforced on a 1-minute, variable—interval schedule for
6 days, receiving 72 reinforcements per session. All birds developed stable rates
typical of the VI performance in the first session.

Stage 3

The key was present but responses were never reinforced. (No food was received
for any reason. ) The illumination in the box was alternately red and green following
the schedule of Stage 1. Responses to the key were recorded in the two extinction
curves, one showing responses in the red light, the other those in green. Thus, a
small segment of one curve was recorded, then a small segment of the other, and
so on. The recorder not in use was stopped. A single process of extinction was
thus recorded in two curves showing alternating performances in red and green
lights.

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the extinction curves obtained in red and green lights for the
two pigeons which received food in red light, and Fig. 2 for the two pigeons which
received food in green light at Stage 1. In all cases the extinction session began
with the red light present.

Bird 1 (Fig. 1) begins to respond almost immediately (at a) in spite of the fact
that heretofore the operant has been reinforced only in white light. At _t_) the light
was changed to green, and the small segment ending at c was then recorded. The
performance then continues, beginning at b, and so on, throughout the session. The
initial rates of responding in the presence of the two colors are of the same order,
but are less than half of the rate on the VI 1 in white light. Beginning at d, re-
sponding almost ceases in green light, although it continues at a substantial though
irregular rate in red light for at least 2 hours. The experiment was stopped at the
end of the records. The total numbers of responses emitted in the red and green
lights are in the ratio of 3. 3 to 1.

Bird 2 in Fig. 1 shows a more marked effect of changing from the white light
prevailing under VI 1. Both rates begin low but subsequently rise. Here again, re-
sponding in the green light drops essentially to zero while there is still consi-
derable activity in red light. The ratio of responses is here about 2 to 1 in favor
of red light.

The curves for the two birds receiving food in green light at Stage 1 are shown
in Fig. 2. Both birds extinguished fairly rapidly. Bird 3 continues to respond in
green light at a ‘high rate for approximately 30 minutes, although responding in

red light drops to a low value after about 3 minutes, except for a slight burst at a.
The ratio of responses in favor of green (the color present during the reception of
food at Stage 1) is 4. 5 to 1.

Bird 4 showed no effect of Stage 1 during the first session of extinction. The
session begins at b (Fig. 2) with a slight acceleration in the rate, which decreases
slightly when the light is changed to green (beginning at c). There are at least two
periods of responding in the red light when the rates are considerably more rapid
than in the green light, although responding continues for a slightly longer time in
the presence of the green light. The numbers of responses in red and green lights
are about the same for the session. When this bird was put in the apparatus on a
second day, however, it emitted 110 responses in green light (the color previously
correlated with food) and 5 in red. (All the other birds also responded more to the
food-correlated color during a second extinction session.)

CONC LUSION

In evaluating these four pairs of extinction curves, it should be noted that the
design of the experiment favors a contrary result. The repeated presentation of
food to a hungry pigeon usually sets up "superstitious" behavior (4); and during the
20 sessions of Stage 1, incidental responses were probably reinforced under the
discriminative control of the light correlated with food. In extinction at Stage 3
such behavior would compete with the response to the key. The bird would have .
more time to respond in the presence of the light not correlated with food. The
pairs of curves may, therefore, inadequately indicate the extent to which a given "
light has acquired control over an operant subsequently conditioned. ‘

The experiment confirms Estes' finding that the contingency between SD and rft J
is sufficient to give _S___D some control over a response subsequently conditioned with
rft. In a standard experiment on discrimination, the same temporal correlation
may be partly responsible for the ultimate stimulus control. It should be noted,
however, that the pairs of extinction curves in the figures show much less control
than would have been obtained if Stages 1 and 2 had been combined—- if the response
had previously been reinforced in one light and extinguished in the other.

PIGEON WATER SUPPLY

Water may be supplied to pigeons in their home cages by means of the inverted
bottle and tube arrangement often used with rats. A metal tube of a 6-millimeter
diameter, bent at an angle of 120 degrees and inserted through the cork of a l-pint
mason jar, has proved satisfactory. The pigeon inserts its beak into the end of the
tube and pumps the water out. If the bird does not find the water at first, a small
water cup may be placed at the end of the tube for a short time.

The National Anti-Vivisection Society

110 EAST OHIO STREET

CHICAGO I I, ILLINOIS

Are You FOR or AGAINST “REGULATION"?

Dear Member:

The National Anti-Vivisection Society was or-
ganized to campaign for total abolition of animal

experimentation in medical and commercial labora-
tories.

It has steadfastly maintained that only complete
prohibition of ViVisection, rather than regulation,
restriction or anything else presented as a com-
promise, offers the only hope of eventual emancipa~
tion of animals from laboratory torture.

So ﬁrmly did the society’s founders believe in the '

principle of total abolition that provisions were
written into the charter and by-laws, which, in the
opinion of our legal counsel, prohibit support for
anything less.

In recent years, as many members know, various
humane organizations have been sponsoring “regu-
lation” bills in Congress, and one of them is getting
increasingly favorable attention from legislators and
the nation’s press.

It is now apparent that thousands of NAVS
members, although they joined a total abolition
society and believe ﬁrmly in its principles, favor
support of some strong regulation bill, convinced
that a law ending even a small part of the suffering
of laboratory animals would be a “step forward” in
the ﬁght for total abolition.

As I write this, I have before me letters from two
members, both intelligent, conscientious and dedi-
cated humanitarians. One has been a member since

1948, the other joined in 1953, and both have been

generous contributors all through the years. N 0
one could possibly question their sincerity or their
intense desire to see animal experimentation abol-
ished. Here are excerpts from the two letters:

1—“I am greatly distressed by the controversy
over ‘regulation’ and unless the National
society does everything it can to bring about
defeat of the bills now before Congres, I pro-
pose to withdraw my support and resign from
the society.”

2—“Reluctantly, after searching my heart, I
have become convinced that the bills for
regulation are a ‘step forward’ in the ﬁght
for total abolition, and if our society con-
tinues to oppose them, I have no choice but
to resign and donate to some other organ-
ization.”

N AVS management is not concerned over pos-
sible loss of ﬁnancial support; we cannot be coerced
and our record shows we have never yielded to
threats from either friend or foe. However, when
hundreds of intelligent members, fully acquainted
with the issues involved and having heard the evi-
dence pro and con, express such adamant and
opposed opinions about the merits of regulation,
we are morally and legally obligated to weigh and
evaluate today’s thinking in the light of changed
conditions.

The sincere conviction of a growing segment of our
membership that regulation could be a “step for-
ward” should not be ignored. This whole contro-
versy, unfortunately, is in the area of speculation
and surmise. Neither proponents nor opponents of
regulation are able to offer conclusive proof their
contentions are unassailable. The best any one of
us can do is search heart and conscience and act
accordingly.

To deny the existence of this increasing sentiment
for regulation, to insist dogmatically that the opin-
ion of NAVS management must prevail, to refuse
to accept the clear mandate to recognize that times
change and strategy should be sufﬁciently ﬂexible
to accommodate itself to such change, would, in my
considered opinion, be a breach of faith with our
members, whatever their present views on the sub-
ject. Both the majority and the minority have
rights we must honor and respect.

After long and careful consideration, your Board

. . of. Directors has determined to resolve the problem

in the only way that seems feasible: a referendum
of the membership.

That is the purpose of this appeal: to ask you to
vote, under carefully controlled conditions, for or
against the proposition on the back page of this
letter.

We beg you to read it thoroughly and carefully
consider the consequences. Please remember that
permissive, not mandatory, action is involved.
NAVS directors will retain the right, if the vote is
FOR the proposal, to decide whether a speciﬁc bill
would, if enacted, provide the adequate and effec-
tive protection for animals we seek, and to give or
withhold support on that basis.

***

On the inside pages are arguments FOR and
AGAINST regulation. There are several bills con-
cerning the welfare of laboratory animals now
before Congress, but the argument for regulation
is based on the merits of the Randall Bill, sponsored
by the Humane Society of the United States, the
only bill the NAVS COULD conceivably support.
The others are weak by comparison and one of them,
certainly, is a complete betrayal of animals.

A measure of the strong feeling which exists over
this issue is the fact that no agreement can be
reached on even so simple a matter as the penalties
provided in the bill under discussion. The pro-
ponent insists that felony prosecutions are possible,
the opponent denies this is true.

Although I may be charged with an attempt to
prejudice the voting, I feel impelled to state that,
as an individual member and cofounder, with the
late George Arliss, of the NAVS, I believe ﬁrmly
that we should never deviate one iota from our posi-
tion that animal experimentation is an unmitigated
evil which must be totally abolished.

As managing director of the society, however, my
personal views are not paramount; I am morally and
legally obligated (and our directors have decided
we should) to explore the possibility that our posi-
tion is now in direct conﬂict with the will of a
majority of the members.

Finally, I have never dodged my responsibility for
recommending the course your society should fol-
low, and my suggestion that this poll should be
taken was not a shirking of that obligation; it was,
rather, recognition of the fact that NAVS manage—
ment is not omnipotent, callously prone to ride
roughshod over the Opinions of all others. I am
conﬁdent right will triumph.

Yours sincerely,

CLARENCE E. RICHARD
Managing Director

 




 

F

The goal of all anti-vivisectionists is abolition of
the use of animals in medical or commercial research.

Nothing short of that goal will be satisfactory.

Within an anti-Vivisection society there can be,
on that subject, no disagreement. In the National
Anti-Vivisection Society, most certainly, there is
none. Vivisection is cruel, Vivisection is useless,
Vivisection is unscientiﬁc: on these points all mem-
bers of the society stand together.

American anti-Vivisection societies shOuld, how-
ever, work actively for enactment by Congress of
the Randall bill, H. R. 4856, even though the bill
would not abolish Vivisection or even end all of the
cruelties of Vivisection.

The supporting argument for this conclusion can
be summarized in four points:

1—Although not perfect, the Randall bill would
outlaw many of the worst cruelties now perpetrated
on animals in research laboratories and would radi-
cally reduce the number of animals used. It is the
best bill that can possibly achieve enactment. Out
of pure humanitarianism, such a bill must be sup-
ported.

2—By requiring substitution of other research
methods for use of animals whenever and wherever
possible, the bill would push all research toward the
anti-Vivisection goal.

3—A vigorous campaign for immediate enactment
of a strong law against the cruelties and the inefﬁ-
ciency of Vivisection is a much more effective means
of public education than a mere campaign against
Vivisection, with no prospect of action in the fore-
seeable future.

4—It appears so likely as to be almost certain that
some kind of legislation to limit and control use of
animals in research will be enacted in the next year
or two by Congress. The anti-Vivisection cause—
progress toward ultimate abolition—will be best
served by a strong campaign for the strongest law
possible at this time.

***

These points need only brief ampliﬁcation, if any.

Let us get one point crystal clear: the Randall
bill, if it becomes law, will stop right now—not in
some far off future—most of the worst of the cruelties

of Vivisection. No enemy of cruelty, no humani-
’ tarian, can Oppose such a law. And no one can
with clear conscience forget Ruskin’s famous truth:
“He who is not actively kind, is cruel,” Neutrality,

in this battle, becomes support for cruelties that the
Randall bill would prevent.

The proposed law would push research workers
toward methods not involving use of animals through
operation of a clause requiring that all experiments
be designed and executed so as to obtain maximum
reduction of number of animals used and to substi-
tute insentient material or models in place of animals
in every possible way.

Authoritative, scientiﬁc studies have revealed
that at least one-fourth of all the animals now used
in laboratories could be saved simply by better sta-
tistical design of experiments. Under the Randall
bill, the Department of Justice would force this life-
saving statistical improvement on the laboratories.
Some 40,000,000 animals might be rescued, every
year, by this clause alone.

    
 

R REGULATION

And who can even conjecture what progress might
be made as thousands of research workers found
themselves restrained from whimsical use of animals,
required to use more rational methods?

What anti-Vivisectionist can oppose or ignore a bill
that would move in that direction? It would be a
giant step toward the anti-Vivisection goal.

There can be no doubt that a campaign for im-
minently possible legislation makes an enormously
greater impact on the general public than mere out-
cries against Vivisection.

Let’s face the fact: in the century since Henry
Bergh declared war on American Vivisection, the
movement has continuously lost ground in the
battle for public opinion. The number of animals
used has increased to numbers almost beyond com-
prehension. Congress pours mounting millions of
dollars into Vivisection every year. The general
public approves and applauds.

It is time for a change, not of goal but of strategy.
The noble anti-Vivisectionists who originated our
movement certainly would be the ﬁrst, could they
be with us today, to advocate new methods of reach-
ing the public. The originators and early members
of our society were innovators, pioneers of thought,
aggressive ﬁghters who used imaginatively the edu-
cation tools of their time. They would rightly think
us foolish and false to our trust if we persist in
shouting the shibboleths of the past, ignoring the
fact that today there are new and always changing
factors of public psychology, technology, mass com-
munication and politics.

A campaign for the Randall bill is not “com-
promise”, it is a battle for progress. It is power—
ful public education. It moves us in the direction
we wish to go.

Finally, even those anti-vivisectionists who most
dislike and distrust the idea of “regulation” of Vivi-
section must face the fact that some degree of
regulation virtually certainly is going to be enacted

into law. Willy-nilly, we are going to have “regu-
lation”.

The issue before us, therefore, is not one of being
for or against regulation. The issue is: are we to
have strong, effective regulation or are we to have
a weak law that will protect vivisectors but not
animals. The Randall bill is a genuinely strong bill,
with teeth in it. Unlike other bills, the Randall bill
provides for felony prosecutions of Violators. En-
forcement responsibility is put in the Department of
Justice, effectively insulated from the inﬂuences of
government departments that themselves practice
Vivisection. Contrast the Randall bill with a bill
introduced by Representative Fogarty of RhOde
Island, which would permit the Surgeon—General 0f
the U. S. to decree what is “humane” and leave
enforcement to the National Institutes of Health,

the biggest congeries of Vivisection laboratories in the
world.

A vote in this referendum against support of the
Randall bill is not a vote against “regulation”, it 15
a vote for the rFogarty bill or some other, perhaps
even worse, substitute for the Randall bill.

An afﬁrmative vote, on the other hand, is a vow
against cruelty, a vote against the waste and inef—
ﬁciencies of Vivisection, a vote to move forWaI‘.
toward the original and ultimate goals of the antl‘
vivisection movement.

 




AGAINST REGULATION

I-Iere are some reasons why you should vote
agalnst a change 1n “regulation”. That means you

must vote. “NO” on the ballot, after you think about
the questlon.

* * *

The people who ask you to support their “regu-
lation” bill have used not less than nine false argu-
ments to persuade you. But before we turn to those
false arguments, look at two devastating admissions
the Regulators make right in the argument enclosed
with this ballot:

1—They admit, “the bill would not . . . even abolish
all the cruelties of vivisection.” In other words, the
bill would enact into law permission for the vivi-
sectors to commit all the remaining cruelties of
vivisection. Even if the bill were passed, and en-
forced, all those cruelties would go on, while the
public was told the animals were protected. For

proof, think of the nightmare that followed when
regulation was enacted in England.

2—They choose to say, “vivisection is cruel, vivi—
section is useless, vivisection is unscientiﬁc. . .” The
Regulators evidently do not even understand the
fundamental principle of the anti-vivisection move-
ment: Vivisection is evil. It is evil in the oldest and
widest sense. If they understood that, they would
not sponsor regulation, which is a compromise with
evil that helps the vivisectors to go on with their
evil work. There can be no good compromise with
evil. NAVS is not just ﬁghting cruelty, or useless
or unscientiﬁc work. It is ﬁghting evil, in the only
way evil can be defeated.

* * '*

There is literally not room to list here all the
false arguments they have used to tempt you, in the
name of the animals. ‘ You will spot them yourself.
But here are some typical examples:

(a) -—They say (you can read it right in the en-
closed materials): “The Randall bill provides for
felony prosecution of violators.” This is absolutely
false. It is there to persuade you that the bill would
protect the animals. But it happens that the full
text of the Randall bill is available in the official form
in which the government prints bills introduced in
Congress. And the truth is that there is not one
word about “felony prosecutions” in the whole bill.
You can check that easily. There can be no doubt
or misunderstanding about it. Their bill does not
make cruelty a crime. It does not require any one
to prosecute any vivisector, no matter what is done
to the animals. It does not even require prosecu-
tion if the vivisectors fail to ﬁle the “plan” the bill
calls for on how the vivisectors are going to “use”
the animals, to get federal tax money for their

hideous “projects”, for which the bill actually-

provides.

. (b) —They say, “A campaign for the Randall bill
Is not a compromise.” This is absolutely false. The
Randall bill lets the tortures of vivisection go on.
It sets no end to them. (It should rightly be called
the “Scandal” bill.) The Regulators tell you that
“Some 40,000,000 animals might be rescued every
Year . . .” But notice the sneaky little word,
“might”. They don’t tell you how they get that big
number, because they don’t know that even one
ﬁlnimal would beneﬁt. They are actually guessing,
In a matter of this seriousness, and what is more,
they used the word “rescued” to make you think
that some animals would be set free, saved from the
Vlvisectors. But the Regulators’ bill offers no guar-
antee that those supposed “40,000,000” animals
would not sirnply be tortured in some other way the
blll permits. What would their chances be? The
Regulators don’t know. But one thing is sure.

eir bill is a compromise, a terrible compromise,
and the arguments they use to try to get your
slllpport for their bill are deceiving. Instead of, “X
anunals might be rescued . . .” they should offer a
‘ guflrantee that the bill would actually save the

anlnlals out of the hands of the vivisectors.

((3) -They say, “Out of pure humanitarianism,
Such a bill must be supported.” This is absolutely

 

false. The bill is a do-nothing bill. They are in no
position to guarantee that their bill won’t be made
far more favorable to the vivisectors before it even
gets to a vote. Right now, such pious good wishes
for the animals as it contains could never be en-
forced. They make a big point of the fact that the
bill mentions the Department of Justice. But the
fact is that the government itself tortures animals.
Just think of the FDA beagles, being methodically
poisoned in a sub-basement right there in Washing-
ton. Their bill would not stop that. No human-
itarian should support any bill that writes into
Federal law the premise that what the vivisectors
are doing is good and useful, as their bill does.

((1) —They say, “Willy-nilly, we are going to have
regulation.” This is an opinion, not a fact! They
are asking for your support, because they know we
will only have regulation if you let it happen. These
same people told the whole country that Congress
was surely going to pass their bill in 1961 or 1962.
They were wrong. They say they want your sup-
port for their bill against several “weaker” bills.
According to them, the AMA and NSMR lobbies
are so strong that an abolition bill can’t be passed.
Then what do they think is going to happen to their
bill? Would the AMA or the NSMR let anything
but the weakest bill pass? The Regulators are
ﬁghting between themselves, and they want to use
NAVS as a cat’s paw. The truth is that any bill
passed today will have to have the blessing of the
vivisectors. You are being asked to abandon the
ﬁght NAVS has waged against a bill that would
seal the fate of the animals.

(0) —They say, “A . . . campaign for (regulation)
is (an) effective means of public education . . .”
This is just another opinion. The public spectacle
of anti-vivisectionists abandoning their basic prin-
ciples is not good public education. The public
needs education in the value of principles and cour-
age, not in how to betray the animals and then call
it “humane”. The N SMR itself has gotten up a
“humane code”. We all know what faith to put in
that. The public needs education in the necessity
of putting an end to vivisection, not in ways to com-
promise with it, as the Regulators want to do.

(f) —They say, “The (A-V) movement has con-
tinuously lost ground in the battle for public opin-
ion.” This is the worst falsehood of all. It takes
twisted facts even to say this. What do they mean,
“lost ground”? The NAVS has made progress in
every year for the last thirty years, progress that can
be seen and measured and proved. It’s NAVS, and
not the Regulators, that the vivisectors fear. The
Regulators know this. That is why they are trying
so hard to get your support. NAVS has solid prin-
ciple and proven accomplishment. The Regulators
have a “patent cure-all”, a bill backed only by their
sales talk. They can offer no guarantee, no proof,
no assurance—only that their bill “might” do this
or that—and their bill is only one of several now in
Congress. They themselves criticize the other bills
as too weak or pro-vivisection. Yet they, and no one
else, can say which bill Congress would pass, if anti-
vivisection resistance were ended.

* ‘k *

There are other false statements in the argu-
ments they offer you for regulation (they say that
if Henry Bergh were alive today, he would support
regulation! Then why did he ﬁght it when he was
alive? Did some medium tell the Regulators that he
had changed his principles?).

* * *

But there is only one real reason why you must
vote “NO” to regulation. This is because you be-
lieve in anti-vivisection principles, the abolition of
vivisection. Sincere people don’t regulate murder (or
treason. No matter how hard the ﬁght, they outlaw
them. You can only keep faith with the animals,
and achieve the end of vivisection, by voting “NO”
to Regulation, which permits vivisection to go on,
and actually helps it to increase and ﬂourish, by
giving it legal sanction.

Residents of the Gainesville area of Virginia were
shocked one morning last week by the news that bodies
, of several hundred dogs and cats had been fOund in a

J ' trench behind a barn whose owners collect animals for
-- medical research. The Virginians were further shocked to
' learn that other animals—~—some dead, so‘me alive had
:br-been found crammed together in filthy pens inside the
' barn.
' The ugly news sped swiftly to _‘W"aslrington, where it
. is now spurring humane groups to work for laws that
F would require humane treatment of animals used for
; medical experimentation, specifically in experiments made
f possible by federal grants (this year totalling a billion
l dollarsl.
l 0 Two humane groups are backing a bill that was intro-
duced in January by Sen. Joseph S. Clark (D—Pa.) and
Sen. Maurine Neuberger (D—Ore). The bill would elim-
t r inate cruelty and neglect in the housing and handling
of laboratory animals used in federally backed experi—
ments and tests. The bill, its framers say, has been
carefully drafted to avoid any impediments toirational
scientific study and is in no sense an antivivisection
bill.

The Clark-Neuberger bill is. an amended and clarified

form of a bill on which the 87th Congress held hearings
last fall. At the hearings hundreds of examples of cruelty
to animals were introduced into evidence. At that time,
Fred Myers, executive director of the Irlurnane Society
of the, United States, told the committee that more than
300,000,000 vertebrate animals are used annually in re—
search in this country and that a billion dollars of federal.
money went to that research.
In testifying to inhumane treatment of many of the
animals h’lyers introduced a Blalock press (similar to an
goldsfashioned printing press in which one plate can be
forced against an opposing face by a screw arrangement).
In the Blalock press, both plates have rows of dull steel
teeth. This press, h’lyers testified, is used to crush the
leg of a dog. He explained that a hind leg of a "dog is
inserted in the transverse slot of the press so that the
animal’s flesh can be crushed to a pulp without breaking
the bones of the leg. The press can be calibrated so
that measurablepressures ranging from 500 to 5,000
pounds oer square inch can be exerted.

Myers said that in one university experiment alone,
400 dogs were crushed in the press in a study of the
« - :-;-*-”“1"';“‘-_~'anesthet_izeo )efore pressure of 2,000 pounds per square
' “ ' finch was applied to the legs. Each dog remained in the
. press for several hours but in no case was any anesthetic

given during the last hour in the press. Nor was any

anesthesia or sedative given later while the dogs lived .

(between 542 hours after release from the press).

Myers said some experimenters used rawhide mallets,
instead of the press, beating the hind'legs of the animal

1,000 blows. Ether was discontinued as soon as the beat—

Kittens being used for research are housed in
extremely cramped cage. typical of inhumane
treatment to test animals: '

ing stopped. Of the 30 dogs used in this experiment,
25 died of their injuries, living from one—nine hours.

Also introduced as evidence were published reports
of medical journals describing in detail experiments on
animals in research into burns. One team tied pigs to a
steel grate set about two feet over pans full of gasoline
in a concrete, fireproof room. The gasoline was ignited
by an electric spark. Another group forced dogs to
take 120 inhalations of air heated to 500 degrees centi-
grade. The dogs were anesthetized while breathing the
searing air but not later. One such dog lived’ for four
hours. ' .

Other experimenters forced dogs to inhale actual
flames. These animals were killed three to five days after
the inhalations. One published report discussed in detail
an experiment supported by the Office of Naval Research
in which 43 female dogs were scalded by dipping them
into water heated to 185 degrees fa-rehheit.,Though an-
esthetized during the scalding, the animals received no
anesthesia or sedative after they regained consciousness.

Researc

 

 

Most of these animals died within 24 hours but only.
after suffering intense agony. \ I
Committee members were told by a steady stream of “ ' j 7 r.
witnesses of additional pain and discomfort of laboratOry ’ "
animals caused by bad housing and lack of exercise. Many - - - é'
laboratory animals, the legislators were told, are never V
released from their often—too—small pens except during an
actual experiment.
One student of veterinary medicine testified that one ~ ' - . "if“
laboratory never exercises its dogs. He said, “As I walked
into one dog room, I was met by the powerful stench ' ‘ -.
of ammonia. The cages were solid bottomed and the Wet;
metal was spotted with small piles of wood shavings,’
thoroughly soaked with manure and decomposed urine——— "‘ 1 r.
the source of the ammonia smell. Cockroaches were visible '\ ’ y L" r,
in several cages, crawling in the filth, though the room ' -"’ f -:
was light." , —
He said that in one cage he found there was no _
food dish. Instead, the food had been emptied onto the ‘
cage bottom and the dog was nibbling on the mixture ‘ '*
of dogfood, wood shavings, excrement and cockroaches. '
The sign-on the door of this room read “Special Diet."
Though there were score of preponents for the bill I .
appearing before the committee, there were also groups ;
appearing in opposition—the AntioViviseetionist Society, .-
which will be satisfied only wth abolishment of use of _ ,-
animals for experimental purposes, and the American 2
Medical Association and its subsidiaries on the grounds , ' ..
that the bill would be restrictive and that its very proposal
implies a “shocking and unjustified indictment of scien-
tists and doctors." 7
Since the day of the hearing nothing has been heard 7
from the committee. And it has been more than a month
since the Clark—Neuberger bill was introduced but no
hearings have as yet been scheduled. The new legislation
would not prohibit experimentation on animals necessary , . ,.
for medical research but it would attempt to eliminate . 3
the inflicting of unnecessary pain. It would also require
the licensing of persons experimenting with animals and _ 1‘
provide for loss of license for inhumane acts. . ' ‘ '0 ':-':-.’
The Clark-\leuberger bill would also establish a min4
imal standard of food and water and resting place and -. {I
some provision for the exercise of the animals. Most»
important, it would permit inspection of the laboratories-
action refused now y most of the experimental labora-
tories. ' . "
At the present time, in spite of the new, proposal,jno 7 . . ,
action seems for forthcoming. A humane group spokes’rna‘ni' i, T' i
said that with the strong opposing lobby of the medical
and veterinarian groups and the antivivisectionists, it is
unlikely that the proposed bill will even get a hearing. .
He said the inactivity of the momth can be countered ' 7 J
only by strong and large supporting groups. This leaves ” #5,
it up to everycommunity and every indiyidualﬁto contact ‘ ’ - 7;
their. representatives in “fashington urging them to sup- _ 7‘

Since the ﬁrst story in Pet Parade (March 18) on— a
proposed law that would provide for the humane treat—
111€Illt of all laboratory animals, hundreds of letters have
poured into Newsday commenting on the need for siich

law and expressing distress at the instances of needless
. torture reported in the story.

All of the reported instances (only a few of the total)
were submitted as documented testimony'pbefore a con—
gressional committee. Copies of the hearings can be ob-
tained from the US. Government Printing Ofﬁce, ”Wash—

‘ ington 23, DC, at a cost of $1 each. Ask for cppy of
-“Humane Treatment of Animals Used in Research.

Because the County Irritant space in Newsday is
limited, this page is being devoted to excerpts from some
of the letters written to Newsday during the past two
weeks. Significantly, only one letter was received opposing
such legislation. It is printed ﬁrst. '

East l\v”Iead0w~Ii was Shocked to read the distorted

article in Virginia Shcrwood’s Pet Parade, Animals
Used in Research Get Shocking Treatment (hilareh l8) . . .
Exceedingly high moral and humane standards for

laboratory animals and their quarters are self prescribed.

and self enforced by the following scientiﬁc agencies?

Animal Care Panel, Boards of Health. ASPCA. National '

Institutes of Health, American College of Laboratory

Animal h’ledicinc, and National Research Council‘s Insti-

tue of Laboratory Animal Resources. Scientists welcome
the inspections and visitations of these ofﬁcial agencies
and eagerly seek their advice on continual improvements
of their laboratory—animal maintenance.

The scientist knows better than anyone that valid
experimental data can only be collected on healthy. com‘
fortable, well-fed animals. It is obvious that Virginia
Sherwood never stepped into the modern, air-conditioned.
well—lit, cheerful, sanitary laboratory animal quarters in
our research. institutes across the country to personally
try to verify the untruthful hearsay she so glibly quotes.
The animal quarters in these institutes are supervised by
trained veterinarians. . .

' The type of legislation supported by Virginia Sher-
wood is restrictive, destructive, and an unnecessary burden
to, our scientiﬁc community, it will hamper medical prog-
ress by bureaucratic red tape. Such legislation infers that

the scientists are monsters and can’t be trusted to have

any humane feelings towards animals. This, of course. is
untrue, since most are pet lovers . . .

Virginia Sherwood has not one positive word for the
medical researcher. Nevertheless, that same day, Newsday
carried a brief announcement that a new measles vaccine
will be on the market; truly a signiﬁcant answer. to vote
down the repressive legislation against scientists. .

If we hOpe to cure the physical and mental. ailments
that plague man then we must trust the scientist with. the
freedom he needs in creativeresearch. His work at the
same time will continue to benefit the animal kinkdom.

wonderful publicity in Pet Parade of i\"larch IS relative

Noted Philosopher
‘ Addsﬂis- Voice

The renowned philosopher and
medical missionary, Dr. Albert
Schweitzer has joined the chorus of
animal lovers who are urging pass-

- ' - age of-the Clark-

Neuberger bill in
Congress to bring
about ‘humane
treatment for. ani-
mals, used in medi-
cal eXperiments.

. Readers of this
newspaper are fa-
miliar with the
problem due to the
enlightening series
which appeared 0p-
posite this page a

couple of weeks ago. The series was
by Ann Cottrell Free of the North

American Newspaper Alliance.

SCHWEITZER

The author related the inhumane.
conditions under which animals await
experimentaticm — cramped, over-
crowded, unclean and poorly ventilat-
ed quarters.

Now Dr. Schweitzer has written to
Sen. Maurine Neuberger of Oregon:

“The ethic of Reverence for Life
obliges us to be watchful always to
treat animals with compassion, and
all the more so when it concerns those
creatures that serve medical re-
search. If you- pass such a law in
the United-States, it will have im-
portant meaning for the world.”

We heartily concur.

EVIDENCE He‘s 'DEEN turned

up that animals used for laboratory
expetrimmve been mistreated,
by some of the keepers as well as
by some researchers.

At one supply center, according
to information given to members
of Congress, animals were kept. in
an unheated barn and were half-
starved. At some university labo-
rator1es animals have been kept in
filthy, cramped cages, and have
been forced to inhale fire, have
been experimentally scalded, and
starved.

There’s no point in such bar-
barlty.

A number of congressmen are

aroused over the situation, and a
bill is now pending which would
require humane treatment of all
animals used for experimental
work in laboratories.
. We urge that this bill not be lost
in the rush of last-minute work
before Congress adjourns late this
year. It ought to be reported out
on both Senate and House floors
for action at an early date.

Good Legislation Bet/ween Extremes

Legislation purporting to protect ani—
mals use-d for experimental purposes must
be tested by a rule of priority. The pres-
ent and future welfare of human beings
must take priority over the welfare of
animals. Too much so—called anti-vivisec—
tion legislation reverse-s this order.

But the welfare of animals, in terms
of minimal comfort and humane treat—
ment under experimental circumstances,
is not necessarily contradictory to the wel-.
fare of humans, in terms of the continu—
ance of animal experimentation which is
necessary for advances in medical re-
search. Researchers can continue to use
animals in their essential experiments
and still see that they are decently treat-

ed and humanely disposed of.

Legislation is now pending in Congress,
under the sponsorship of Senators Clark,
Neuberger and Young, which would ac-
complish both of'these ends. It clearly
recognizes the need for animal experi-
mentation, but it sets up minimum stand-
ards of humane care of the animals being
used.

The bills (identical ones in the Senate

and the House), would permit the Secre-
tary of Health, Education and Welfare to
grant certificates of registration to those

involved in animal experimentation un-
der grants from the federal government
or one of its agencies, and impose condi-
tions, including provision for the curb-
ing of pain in experimental subjects, the
humane killing of animals which would
suffer continued pain, and insistence that
the animal subjects have clean, comfort-
able housing and adequate food and wa-
ter. These rules could be enforced by un-
announced inspection of animal quarters,
laboratories and records.
>z< >1< >1<

This walks between the extremes on
this subject; between those who would
submit animals to careless, useless cruelty
in the name of scientific research, and
those who would ban all use of animals
in research in the name of humanity to
animals—but not to humans.

To those who are truly humane to all
living things, and who recognize a sen-
sible system of priority, this is reasonable
legislation and deserves support.

 

Springfield (Hass.) Daily News, June 25, 1963

Cruelty to Animals

Many instances of cruelty to animals
were eliminated as horses were re-
placed by internal combustion engines,
and as movie makers found camera
techniques to suggest violence instead
of actually creating it.

The next target was the slaughter-
house, and proponents of humane
treatment of animals there won the
c0aoperation of some meat packers and
of some Weapon manufacturers. Fed-
eral legislation which is realistic and
enforceable extended and standardized
these reforms. .

The remaining problem which chal-
lenges advocates of humane treatment
of animals concerns medical research
laboratories. Many eminent doctors
whose names identify some of the great
modern miracles of medicine have
given credit to research conducted on
animals. Salk vaccine is only one of
many life-saving, health-assuring pro-
tections made possible by experiments
on animals. On the other hand, there
are those who argue that it is moral-
ly wrong for man to impose the risks
of new surgical techniques and drugs
on animals in order to make them safe
for human use.

Between the antivivisectionists who
oppose all research surgery on living
animals, and those who fear. that any
more controls will hamper or prevent
necessary medical research, are advo-

cates of a humane system which would
protect the animals from unnecessary
suffering, but still permit laboratory
experimentation on surgical and drug
treatments to save human lives. Such
a system is not unattainable. In fact,
one has been in use in Great Britain
for almost 90 years. Just last year, the
Animal Welfare Institute in New York
noted in one of its reports: “The Brit-
ish Act of 1876 stands as the most just
and humane law on animal experimen-
tation ever enacted.”

Six bills concerning medical research
on animals are now before the Congress,
and even many of those who admit that
reforms are needed in some labora-
tories argue that these can be effected
voluntarily, by self-policing. Propo-
nents of legislation are too familiar
with similar proposals from some meat
packers who succeeded in delaying ade-
quate slaughter house legislation, and
the proponents will therefore regard
any such proposal as merely a delay-
ing tactic. '

The need for reform is generally rec-
ognized. The way to reform has al-
ready been charted, and long tested,
by the British. The United States
should. adopt a law which will not re-
tard the progress of medical research,
will establish humane standards of ani-
mal care and use, and will provide for
effective enforcement.

Experiments on living animals are

the medical knowledge which leads
to the saving of human lives. Still,
there is merit in the several bills now

For an End to Cruelty

The current session of Congress, faced with
such vital matters as the test ban treaty, civil
rights legislation, tax reform and reduction, rail-
road strike legislation, and others of significance,
has shown no hurry on doing a job on any of,
them. .
In the field of lesser legislation, too. it has
written a record that leaves much to be desired.

One such measure which surely merits enact-
ment is one to guard against needless cruelty to
animals used in scientific experiments. Several
bills to this end are now in committee. ;.

s- u in a w E

DON’T misunderstand. We are not calling for?
an end to experimentation on animals, for!
some of the most significant and important dis-l

 

coveries in the past century have come from:
lthem. We are no anti-vivisectionist.

But it has been amply documented that
cruelty to animals which is wholly unnecessary
.and gratuitous does indeed exist in some scien-
tific laboratories, either the result of neglect,
or of simple carelessness.

Great Britain has a humane treatment law
which dates well into the last century, and it has
not hampered legitimate animal experimentation.
Surely this country is at least as concerned over
animals who cannot speak on their own behalf
as is Britain.

HIS IS A live subject to many people. Cleve-
land Amory, writing in the Saturday Re-

view, says a piece he wrote on the need for hu-

mane legislation in this field drew more response
than any other in his memory. A later article by
him in the Saturday Evening Post has also drawn
much attention.

There is no excuse for the present situation,
which permits cruelty—either for cruelty’s sake
(rarely, one hopes), or by thoughtless inadver-
tence or a “don’t care” attitude.

We hope Congress can bestir itself this year,
not only to enact legislation vital to the country’s ‘
needs, but also to remove a blot of shame which
a simple piece of tested legislation could do.—'

ed on vertebrate animals in labora-
tories which are supported, in part,

. by federal grants.

Some of the reports, as given in
testimony before a congressional com-
mittee, are sickening. At a farm in
Virginia, hundreds of dead dogs and
cats were found piled in open
trenches, most of them victims of

_ starvation and neglect. The‘farm had

been leased to a firm supplying ani-
mals to laboratories and one of its
best customers was the United States
National Institute of Health.

The director of the National Catho-

. lic Society for Animal Welfare told of,
| visiting laboratories where animals
. “are truly beaten, starved, burned,
- frozen, blinded, drowned, accelerated,
‘ deprived of sleep, irradiated, skinned

and subjected to other methods of
inducing pain and fear."

Such practices, unless they can be
directly related to an important med-
ical goal. have. no place in Amerlcan
society. Certainly they should not be

favors Senate Bill 533
(Clark-Neuberger-Young bill) and
House Bill 5430 (Ashley bill). These
bills, in general, call for licensing of
each person who uses animals (with
the provision that the license will be
lifted for inhumane acts), registra-
tion of premises, record keeping, ade-
quate food, water and resting places,
and laboratories would be subject to
unannounced inspection.

Another bill, H. R. 4856 (Randall
bill) goes further and would require
that anyone anesthetizing an animal
have a doctoral degree. This is an
extreme provision which the Ameri-
can Medical Association says would
seriously hamper research.

Attitudes toward animal and hu~
man suffering go hand in hand. In
frontier America, where bear-baiting
and dog-fighting were favorite diver-
sions, there was also callous disregard
for human life. A similar analogy can

. be seen in Latin countries where the
‘ crowds cry for the blood of a bull.

In America, such practices should
be curbed. Moderate legislation, such
as that favored by the Alabama hu-
mane societies, should be able to
achieve this end without hampering

DAILY KENNEBEC JOURNAL

AUGUSTA, MAINE

Friday. August 9. I963

For A Law Against Cruelty

A reader has sent the KJ a copy of a
speech made in the Senate by Democratic
Sen. E. L. (Bob) Bartlett of Alaska June 13
on the subject of government-supported
cruelty to animals use-d for medical and bi-
ological research.

The senator said vivisection is necessary
and that without it “we would not have the
polio serum, antibiotics and many of the
most modern surgical techniques.”

But, he charged, “in a few of the labora-
tories supported by government funds” ani-
mals under study receive cruel and inhumane
treatment. He listed these instances:

Cages too small to allow the animal to
stand; no regular water or feeding facilities;
inadequate sanitation and resulting infesta-
tions of vermin and disease; surgical opera-
tions performed without anesthetics; no pro-
vision for post-operative care; a single ani-
mal used “as a training ground” for a crew
of surgical students in a series of operations,
one immediately following another; animals
clamped into forms which hold them immov-
able for many weeks.

Certainly no American who considers him-
self civilized would willingly pay taxes to
support any laboratory in which such cruelty
prevails. Sen. Bartlett did not name the
offending laboratories. But he did offer a

. list of six points, prepared by the Society

for Animal Protective Legislation of New
York, for a law curbing such cruelty. The

‘ list follows:

1. Unannounced inspection by qualiﬁed,
full-time inspectors, with access to animal
quarters, laboratories, and records of ani-
mal use.

2. Individual licensing by governmental
authority of all scientists desiring to use live,
vertebrate animals, with the right to remove
said licenses from persons responsible for
inhumane treatment.

3. Pain-curbing provision that animals suf-
fering severe, enduring pain must be pain-
lessly killed instead of being allowed to linger
in agony or being used over again.

4. Humane care and housing, normal ex.
ercise, comfortable resting places, adequate
food and water for all animals.

5. Student work, as distinct from research
conducted by qualiﬁed scientists, must be.
painless.

6. Records, including a statement of what
is to be done to the animals and why, identi-

ﬁcation of animals and eventual disposition,
should be required.

Sen. Bartlett noted that the British have
had a humane treatment law such as this
since 1876. “The law is carefully enforced,”
he went on. “it is not recorded that it has
in any way restricted the growth of science
or medicine in the United Kingdom.”

The United States, as a civilized nation,
should enact and enforce a similar law.

EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS
IN GREAT BRITAIN

by
MAJOR C. W. HUME, O.B.E., M.C., B.Sc., M.I.B10L.
Secretary-General of UFAW

(The Universities Federation for Animal Welfare)

HE STRONG FEELINGS aroused by controversy on this subject,
Tand the large and increasing number of animals used, make it

diﬁicult to construct a realistic picture of the facts. The follow-
ing statement represents an attempt to do this impartially in the light
of experience gained in connection with the work of UFAW, though
even the most objective generalizations can only be probable
estimates.

The writer has sought advice from a number of knowledgeable
and reliable persons but must accept sole personal responsibility
for the opinions expressed.

UTILIZATION OF ANIMALS IN 1960

Surgical procedures without anaesthetics ............................................................ None
Painful experiments by students .................................................................................... None

Third-year honours students in physiology may, however, be
licensed to make tests on living animals which are fully anaesthetized
and are killed before recovering consciousness.

Experiments on conscious animals illustrating

lectures to students ...................
Lecture experiments on anaesthetized animals

which were killed before recovery of

consciousness ............................................................................................................
Surgical procedures under anaesthesia without

recovery of consciousness .............................................................................. 51,560
Surgical procedures under anaesthesia with

subsequent recovery of consciousness ...................................................... 304,160

 

These include many quite minor operations, but also a certain
number of major operations. Proper nursing and sedation are
prescribed. A laboratory in which drastic experimentation is done
resembles not a torture chamber but a hospital ward, albeit some- '

I

 




 

times an understaffed ward without night nurses. Cases are known,
however, in which the conditions are believed to be better (for dogs)
than in many human hospitals.

A great deal depends, especially in the case ot‘ rodents and other
small animals, on the degree of skill and sympathy with which
animals are handled and anaesthetized, experimental procedures
carried out, and post-operative requirements t‘ultilled.

Surgical procedures in cancer research
(included above) ............................................................................ 52,923

Non-surgical procedures in cancer research-.. ...l76,828

Cancer research includes a great many tests of food—ingredients
and the like for carcinogenic properties, usually with negative
results so that the animals do not suﬂ'er. For pure research spon-
taneous tumours are preferred. Normally the growth-rate of a
tumour is measured for a given period and the animal is then killed.
When tumours are induced by transplantation for testing curative
drugs, the animals are killed when it is seen that the growth of the
tumour is not being suppressed. Animals are killed before they die
of cancer except in cases in which it is essential to measure the sur-
vival time. If a tumour ulcerates, the animal is killed at once in
accordance with the Pain Rule.

Diagnosis ...................................................................................................... , ................. 2 l 8,93 1

Diagnosis, mainly in Public Health and hospital laboratories,
still consists to a considerable extent in testing for tuberculosis. by
inoculating guinea-pigs with pleural ﬂuid, urine, or other human
specimens or with milk. On being killed, perhaps less than a quarter
of the animals will have developed tubercle. Samples of milk are
similarly tested for Brucella and Q fever. A large proportion
of the remaining tests are for virus infections. If the result is
positive the inoculated mice die after a few days, but though they
presumably feel ill they do not normally suffer pain except in the
case of tetanus, when they are killed as soon as the signs are

observed. When the results of any such tests are negative there is
no suffering, of course.

Pregnancy tests are no longer treated as coming under the Act
of 1876. The writer does not know for certain why this is, but
suspects that it has something to do with an abundance of young
women fearing the worst, and possible abuse by abortionists. It
may well be, however, that a retrograde step has been taken and
that pregnancy tests ought to be restored to the ambit of the Act.

Animals used in the standardization of drugs,
sera and vaccines _ 1,236,585

Other pharmaceutical tests are not distinguished in Home
Oﬂice reports. One might guess them at, say, another half-million.

The testing of drugs, etc. comprises (1) the screening of new
compounds to ascertain their properties, with a battery of possibly
a score of routine tests; (2) screening in search of a compound
having prescribed properties; (3) testing of drug-s whose molecular
structure has been tailored for speciﬁc purposes in the light of theory;
(4) assay to determine the potency of batches of products in a pharma-
ceutical factory; (5) tests of toxicity. Many, perhaps a substantial
majority, of the animals will suffer little or not at all; often a toxicity
test, for instance, will be negative. But often routine testing entails
estimates of LD50, in which case about half the animals eventually
die, or ED50. They must feel ill, at least, though often they become
comatose. There are, however, a certain number of instances, in
toxicology for instance, in which more serious suffering arises.

In any case, the vast volume. and rapid increase in pharmaceutical
testing (in large establishments the requisitioning of mice is like
turning on a tap for water) raises several diﬂicult questions:—(1)
To what extent could an end point other than death be more often
used in quantal assays? (2) Has the possibility of using protozoa
and othefsimple organisms for screening been sufﬁciently explored?
(3) Is the level of signiﬁcance prescribed for bioassays reasonably
related to the variance of the clinical response? (4) To what extent,
if at all, do biological tests required under the Therapeutic Substances
Act, 1956 persist, because they have become customary, after non-
biological tests have become available?

(5) It has been estimated that 2,000 compounds are synthesized,
tested and discarded for every one drug that eventually issues from
research. Would a less empirical research strategy effect an economy
of animals? On one hand most modern drugs have, naturally,
been produced by the method customarily adopted. On the other
hand an experienced and far~seeing pharmacologist has expressed
to the writer the view that “lack of integration between biologists
and chemists in the planning of desirable ways of screening com-
pounds leads to a disproportionate” amount of testing “by old
methods, and methods capable of adding very little improvement
to the existing types of drugs”. In particular, the common frontiers
of physiology, psychology and pharmacology might best be explored
by a team of biologists and biochemists working in collaboration.

Other research procedures

These include the remaining non-surgical experimental proced-
ures but also some experiments in categories already discussed.
They take place principally in universities and research institutions.
It was roughly estimated by Russell and Burch that about 45 per cent
of them relate to bacteriology, pathology or parasitology. About 8%
per cent may relate to genetics and are presumably f rec from suffer-
ing, unless in exceptional cases of abnormal mutations. About 12
per cent may relate to nutrition and metabolism; usually these will
be of a very innocent nature, though there are also instances in
which the withholding of food or water or of vitamins or other
essential nutrients may entail severe conditions.

Surgical research proper accounts for only a small proportion
of all animals, but in endocrinology, which may account for, say,
4 or 5 per cent of the “other research procedures” under discussion,
surgical treatment such as hypophysectomy or the production of
parabiotic pairs is sometimes entailed. This is done under anaesth-
esia and is included under the “surgical procedures with recovery

THE PURPOSE OF EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS

Three factors have to be considered. (1) The probability of
obtaining new knowledge; (2) the probability of that knowledge
being useful in medicine; (3) the degree of that usefulness. (1)
varies from zero to certainty. Outside of routine testing, a high
probability can best be ensured by keeping experimentation in the
hands, or at least under the direction, of high-grade scientists.
(2) also varies widely. It is near zero in testing a new compound
in a series not known to be of medicinal interest. It reaches certainty
in an assay of the potency of manufactured material known to have
medicinal value. (3) can usually be guessed at in routine tests in a

well-worked ﬁeld, or in work on speciﬁc pathological problems.
In some cases pure research in physiology or biochemistry is
obviously relevant to known medical problems. In other cases it
may appear to be quite irrelevant to any such. Discoveries of this
latter type have sometimes turned out to have a high medical value in
unforeseen ways, but the antecedent probability is relatively small
and would not justify the inﬂiction of appreciable discomfort.

TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN SURGERY

These two are sometimes confused. Surgical research in Britain,
carried out on animals but subject to the Act of 1876, is second to
none in quality. In quantity it is less than in the U.S.A., for instance,
where almost unlimited ﬁnancial and other resources are poured out
for experimentation performed not only by competent scientists but
also by persons, including school children, who do not have scientiﬁc
capability.

In the teaching of surgery in the U.S.A. students are required
to practise on dogs by performing a series of operations on each
animal. The latter is allowed time, such as a week, to recover after
each operation before the next is carried out, and the series is con-
tinued until death supervenes and a further animal is taken into use.
In Britain, on the other hand, students are trained not on animals
but by a system of apprenticeship to senior surgeons, and itis to
this that are attributed the world-famous skill of British surgeons
and the reliability of newly-qualiﬁed members of the profession.

THE INCIDENCE OF SUFFERING

The Pain Rule applies to all research with conscious animals
and requires, inter alia, that if an animal is found to be suﬁering
“severe pain which is likely to endure” it must forthwith be pain-
lessly killed. Opinions may differ as to the proper interpretation
of the Pain Rule in borderline cases, and much depends on the
watchfulness of the laboratory staff and on the skill and gentleness
with which laboratory procedures are carried out, but British
scientists may not, and do not, perpetrate the atrocities that occur
in some laboratories 1n the New World. The training of beginners
is especially important.

Among the practices which may cause most suffering in overseas
laboratories are (1) experiments on shock and stress. The word
“stress”, i.e. adrenal reaction to stimuli, covers a wide
variety of conditions ranging from the trivial, such as the mild

5

 




 

 

 

 

stress experienced by a rat on being moved into a new cage, to
severe and prolonged suﬂ‘ering at the other extreme. When the
Collip drum was described in a Canadian journal in 1949 the
Lancet published a protest signed by six British scientists, of whom
four are Fellows of the Royal Society and three have held vivisection
licences, but this machine is now commonly used in the New World,
and even more extreme treatments have been devised. History shows
that there is a streak of sadism in an appreciable percentage of
human beings; (2) the testing of analgesics, in spite of the fact
that humane techniques are available and in Britain are in general
use; (3) the testing of painful poisons for wild animals. A number of
years ago the Board of Trade published a speciﬁcation for the
assay of red squill on live rats. When the attention of the Home
Ofﬁce was called to it by a member of the public this assay was
prohibited under the Pain Rule.

Humane scientists in Britain give a great deal of thought to the
problem of minimizing suffering and it is very desirable that they
should continue to do so. Mild techniques are normally employed,
though the writer feels a little uneasiness about one or two
particular licensees and a few procedures.

THE HUSBANDRY OF LABORATORY ANIMALS

The welfare of laboratory animals depends on the conditions
under which they are kept more, perhaps, than on any other factor.
The law does not speciﬁcally require the Inspectors to concern
themselves with this relatively novel consideration, except in so far
as it may be relevant to the licensing of premises, but they have in
fact been known to exert very considerable pressure in appropriate
cases.

The conditions under which animals are kept depend on (1) the
space available: this is often insufﬁcient owing to unforeseen
expansion of the work for which an animal house was planned;
(2) staff: well-trained Animal Technicians are indispensable; (3)
knowledge of animal husbandry: the Laboratory Animals Centre
is always willing to advise, the Animal Technicians Association can
provide training, and UFAW publishes the standard textbook;
(4) sympathy for and understanding of animals. (5) A close
liaison with the veterinary profession, such as exists in Holland
and is being built up in the U.S.A., is desirable.

6




A problem which affects all captive animals is that the more
intelligent species, including not only monkeys, cats and dogs but
also rodents, suffer from boredom. This no doubt is greater in
animals which have known freedom than in those which were born
and bred in a research institution, but that is not the whole story.

PRIVILEGED ANIMALS

A fault of the Act of 1876 is that it prescribes special privileges
for those animals which happen to be specially popular. Horses
are put above cats and dogs, and cats and dogs are put above the
nervous and equally sensitive and far more numerous rodents, and
above monkeys. Against this the humane, as opposed to the senti-
mental, will agree that all experimental animals should be treated
with a uniformly high standard of consideration.

THE ATTITUDE OF SCIENTISTS

Scientiﬁc opinion in Britain appears to be nearly unanimous
in favouring Home Ofﬁce control. A few scientists complain of
administrative delays, but in some cases at least these are due to
carelessness on their own part in the framing of their applications.
The only complaints in relation to matters of substance appear to
arise from disallowance by the Home Ofﬁce of certain procedures
in brain neurology which, it is claimed, would not in fact cause pain
if correctly carried out by competent experimenters. This is a
technical point and the decision of the Advisory Committee set up
by the Home Ofﬁce is the safest guide.

Some scientists have found that the obligation to deﬁne the
procedures to be adopted has a technical advantage in forcing a man
to think out more clearly the design of his research. Certain it is
that in medicine and physiology the number of Nobel Prizes awarded
per million of the population is greater in countries which have laws
on vivisection than in those which have not. With few exceptions
British experimenters are anxious to be humane, and anxious to
avoid forgetting that the rats and mice which are used in such large
numbers and are so uniform are in fact individuals; but beginners
in research, and foreigners and Commonwealth citizens coming to
work in Britain, may have to be taught.

About 120 licensed experimenters took part in a UFAW
symposium on “Humane Technique in the Laboratory”, and
UFAW invariably receives sympathy and co-operation in its concern

7

 




 

 

on behalf of laboratory animals. An F.R.C.V.S. recently appointed
to be Laboratories Liaison Ofﬁcer for UFAW has met with a friendly
reception in every laboratory he has visited, and his suggestions for
avoiding suffering have been welcomed. Prof. Medawar, a Nobel
Prizeman in medicine and physiology and now Director of the
National Institute for Medical Research, was a most helpful Chair-
man of UFAW’s Scientiﬁc Advisory Committee until his recent
appointment deprived him of the requisite spare time. A substantial
number of UFAW’s members work in laboratories, either as
research scientists or as technicians, and UFAW’s Scientiﬁc Advisory
Committee includes experimental biologists of high standing.

THE WORK OF THE HOME OFFICE INSPECTORS

An important function of the Inspectors is to interpret the
Pain Rule in borderline cases. Again, the Inspectors go carefully
into the qualiﬁcations of applicants for licences and the nature of
the procedures to be permitted by the certiﬁcates which dispense
with anaesthetics. They rely largely on precedent: usually a pro-
cedure allowed or disallowed in the past will be similarly treated
again. A reliable and experienced scientist may be permitted to do
things not permitted to a novice. For a foreigner temporarily
working in Britain ethical responsibility has to be accepted by a
British scientist.

The Inspectors also inspect premises before licensing them.
They visit laboratories about three times a year on the average.
The popular notion that a Home Ofﬁce Inspector should be primarily
a policeman, pouncing on laboratories in the hope of catching out
an F.R.S. in some breach of the law, is wholly unrealistic. Such a
policy would fail to create the requisite climate of opinion, and would
not achieve its object. The most immediate restraints on a callous
experimenter are the public opinion of his colleagues and the tradi-
tion which has been created under the British system of control.
In a particular instance known to the writer, a foreign licensee who
had recently arrived in this country began to test analgesics by a cruel
method which he had been accustomed to use at home. He was at
once pulled up by two of his British colleagues and obliged to adopt
a humane technique. No system of control could work without
the good will and co-operation of scientists. The disciplinary
powers held in reserve—principally the power to revoke or suspend
a licence—are necessary to ensure that Inspectors shall be taken
seriously, but too much importance should not be attached to the

8

 

 

 




 

 

fact that the only disciplinary action ever taken isfor trivial non-
compliance with formalities. Normally any breach of the regulations

- will be due not to recalcitrance but to failure to understand them,

especially on the part of foreigners or beginners.

But although the goodwill of scientists is a necessary condition
for the humane treatment of laboratory animals it is not a sufﬁcient
condition. It has to be supplemented and organized by the Home
Ofﬁce. This is proved by the fact that although a humane ethical
code (“The Principles of Laboratory Animal Care”) has been drawn
up by representatives of the leading biological societies in the
U.S.A., and although similar codes have been promulgated by
American scientists for many years, in the absence of a statutory
authority with executive powers the principles in question are
frequently transgressed, whereas in Britain they are generally re—
spected. This frequent contrast between laboratories in the two
countries seems to have impressed every scientist who has worked
in both.

When a licensee wishes to dispense with anaesthesia wholly or
in part he must furnish a certiﬁcate (A or B) specifying the procedures
which he is to be allowed to use. The speciﬁcation may be in
broad or narrow terms according to circumstances. The Inspectors
try to ensure that licensees shall understand clearly what is and what

, is not permitted to them and that they shall understand the conditions

laid down—«aseptic precautions, use of tranquillizers after opera-
tions, proper nursing, and so on. The Research Defence Society
publishes a pamphlet which explains clearly the responsibilities of
licensees, and the Inspectors are always ready to answer enquiries
from the latter. Nevertheless, while the good faith and good will
of all the parties are beyond question, there are so few Inspectors
and they have so much to do that one would like to feel quite sure
that all the requirements are always understood by all the licensees.

The Inspectors have to become specialists in research ethics
and to co-operate, in working out humane procedures, with scientists
who are specialists in research techniques. Their quality is far more
important than their number, insufﬁcient though the latter is.
They have to be very ﬁrm but at the same time tactful and more
ready to listen than to speak. They have to understand and love
animals and also be able to understand the rationale of an experi-
mental design. They have to bear constantly in mind the fact that
the purpose of the Act of 1876 is, as its title implies, not to
obviate criticism but to obviate cruelty.

 




 

DESIDERATA

(l) The M.R.C. and A.R.C. and many commercial ﬁrms
recognize the value of the Animal Technicians Association and of
trained animal technicians, for Whom they try to provide suitable
status and prospects, but most universities and the Ministry of
Health do not. It is desirable that they should.

(2) The establishment of Home Ofﬁce Inspectors needs to be
enlarged to keep pace with the increase in the work.

(3) In order to widen the ﬁeld of recruitment a minimum salary
of £3,000 p.a. is desirable; at present it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd recruits
of the necessary calibre except among men who have existing
service pensions to supplement their salaries.

(4) The ﬁeld of recruitment should include suitable veterinarians.
The shrinkage of the R.A.V.C. makes the preceding paragraph
relevant here.

(5) The rules laid down in the Act for the sponsoring of certiﬁ-
cates and applications for licences are out of date and need revision.

(6) Hospital boards and universities could with advantage
allocate more funds than they usually do to animal husbandry.

(7) Animals should be obtained as little as possible from dealers
and as much as possible by breeding on the premises, or failing
that from breeders accredited for certain species by the Laboratory
Animals Centre.

(8) Liaison between laboratories and veterinarians is desirable.

(9) The desirability of restoring pregnancy tests to the ambit of
Home Oﬂice control calls for consideration.

(10) A radical study needs to be made of the problems created
by the vast increase in the volume of experimentation. A new
Royal Commission taking evidence from non-scientiﬁc witnesses
would get bogged down in a morass of misrepresentation and
misunderstanding and is to be deprecated, but good work might be
done by a group of humane and knowledgeable scientists reviewing
as a whole the actualities of present—day research in the light of
ethical principles.

OPINIONS OF BRITISH SCIENTISTS ON HOME OFFICE
CONTROL OF EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS

Report addremd to the President, Animal IVelfare Irzjtz'tate, New York by Major C. W. Hume, M.C., 3.56., .M.l.Bz'ol.

(Serratary-Gerzeral of Unioerxities Federation for Animal W’elfare)

 




 

In connection with Bill 8.3570, introduced by Senator
Cooper and others in the US. Senate and providing for
the control of experiments on animals, and in view of
propaganda to the effect that Home Ofﬁce control frus-
trates medical research in Britain, the following questions
were addressed by Dr. E. Hindle, F.R.S., President of
UFAW, to biological Fellows of the Royal Society and by

myself to a few other British scientists:

1. Do you consider that in consequence of the system

of licensing and inspection administered by the Home
Ofﬁce, medical research of the highest quality cannot be

carried out in Britain?

2. Would you prefer Home Ofﬁce control to be
abolished, so that persons without scientiﬁc training
would be permitted to experiment on animals without
supervision ?

3. Have you in your experience found that the
British system seriously frustrates legitimate research?

In all, 88 scientists, mostly Fellows of the Royal Society,
replied to these questions. Of these only one felt frus-
trated by Home Office control. Twenty-one simply an-
swered ”No” to each question; sixty-six answered ”No”
and added comments, most of which strongly reinforced
their support for the British system, thOugh there were a
few minor criticisms on matters of detail.

Certain minor amendments of our law and practice, not
involving questions of principle and not relevant to the
Cooper Bill, might be desirable, but there can be no doubt
that Home Ofﬁce control is a great success. All of these
supporters of Home Ofﬁce control are experimental ani-
mal biologists with the exception of two physicists, Sir
Edward Appleton and Sir George Thomson, and one
botanist, Sir Edward Salisbury, formerly Biological Secre-
tary of the Royal Society, who were approached in View
of their exceptionally wide acquaintance with research and
researchers in many disciplines. Among medical research
workers who have written to support Home Ofﬁce control
are such men as Prof. Alexander Haddow, F.R.S., Direc-
tor of the Chester Beatty Research Institute; Prof. F. A. E.
Crew, F.R.S., formerly Professor of Public Health in the
University of Edinburgh; Prof. H. A. Krebs, F.R.S.,, Nobel
Prizeman; Sir Bryan Matthews, F.R.S., Professor of Physi-
ology in the} University of Cambridge and a Vice-President
of the Royal Society in 1957; Prof. P. B. Medawar, F.R.S.,
Nobel Prizeman and Director elect of the National Insti-
tute of Medical Research at Mill Hill; Dr. G. F. Marrian,
F.R.S., Director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund;

Prof. Sir James Paterson Ross, Past President of the Royal
College of Surgeons; Lord Boyd Orr, F .R.S., ﬁrst Director-
General of the United Nations Food and Agricultural
Organization, and formerly Director of the Rowett Re-
search Institute; Sir Francis Walshe, F.R.S., for sixteen
years Editor of Brain; Sir William Slater, F.R.S., Secretary
of the Agricultural Research Council; and Dr. W. R.
Wooldridge, Founder and Director of the Animal Health
Trust.

Dr. Leonard Colebrook, F.R.S., wrote: ”I am very glad
indeed that we have control by the Home Ofﬁce and I
should be very sorry to see it abolished”. Sir Francis
Walshe, F.R.S., wrote: ”A wide familiarity with the
literature of experimental neuro-physiology leads me to-
think that in other countries where no such rational mode
of control is used, not a few futile and unnecessarily pain-
ful animal experiments are carried out, by persons not
Prof. A. T. Phillipson,
Deputy Director of the Rowett Research Institute, wrote:
”I am glad to hear the Americans are trying to introduce
a Bill similar to our Home Ofﬁce Act. . . .. The existence
of the Act makes people think a bit harder before starting
an experiment that needs a special licence". Prof. H. A.
Krebs, F.R.S., a Nobel Prizeman, wrote: "I am very glad
indeed to support a move to introduce in the United States
legislation on animal welfare similar to that operating in
Great Britain. My answer to all three questions which
you formulate at the end of your letter is a simple 'no’"
Prof. A. Had'dow, F.R.S., Director of the Chester Beatty
Cancer Research Institute, wrote: ”I have, of course, been
most interested to learn of the American Bill, and sorry to
hear of the opposition to it”. Mr. R. T. Charles, of the
Pollards Wood Cancer Researh Station and Shell Research
Ltd, wrote: "I believe any country can model its vivisec-
tion laws with safety along our pattern in the UK”. I
may add the opinion of Sir Edward Salisbury, F.R.S., who,
though a botanist, has a wide acquaintance with research
workers in many fields and was formerly Biological Secre-
tary of the Royal Society. He wrote: ”I think that it
should be obvious to all who have the real advancement of
knowledge at heart that to allow the inexperienced to carry

out experiments under any other conditions is inexc-usably
bad training”.

always qualiﬁed to do them”.

I now turn to another aspect of the subject. Everything
depends on the way in which legislation of this kind is
administered, and on the quality of those inspectors or
others who administer it. Sir George Thomson, F.R.S.,
Nobel Prizeman and this year’s President of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science, though he is

 




a Physicist, has such wide connections in the scientiﬁc '

world that his opinion must carry weight. He wrote: "Ob-
viously my replies to your queries are based on second-
hand information, but I can honestly say that I have never
heard any serious criticism of the present system of control
from medical research workers or, indeed, from those
doing research on other forms of biology. My answer to
your three questions is therefore ‘No’ in each case”. A
similar reply was sent by another Nobel Prizeman in
Physics, Sir Edward Appleton, Principal of the University
of Edinburgh and a Past President of the British Associa-
tion etc. etc.

Sir John Boyd, F.R.S., Past President of the Royal ,So-
ciety of Tropical Medicine, wrote: "As far as my expe-
rience goes I have found the Home Ofﬁce inspectors
reasonable and helpful and I have never'squered from
obstruction of any kind. It is true that I have heard occa-
sional reports to the contrary, but I have been left, with
the impression that the difﬁculties arose from impatience
and a tendency to disregard the law on the part of the
licensees and not from any desire of the inspector to in-
terfere with legitimate activities”. Prof. R. J. Harrison, of
the London Hospital Medical College, wrote: ”On two
important occasions the Home Ofﬁce made suggestions of
the very greatest help and signiﬁcance which materially
increased the standard of the research and the importance
of the results”. Prof. Hamilton Hartridge, F.R.S., the
physiologist, wrote: ”I always found the Home Ofﬁce and
its inspectors co—operative and helpful. There were oc-
casions when their advice was opportune and invaluable”.
Sir John Hammond, F.R.S., of the Cambridge School of
Agriculture, wrote of Home Ofﬁce Control — ”It forces
us to train our young research workers efﬁciently”. Prof.
Alexander Haddow wrote that the Home Ofﬁce system
uprovides an invaluable guarantee of responsible stand-
ards”. Prof. David Keilin, F.R.S., of the Molteno Insti-
tute, Cambridge, answered the question whether the British
system frustrates legitimate research. .thus: ”Just the op—
posite, it compels the worker to plan and to carry out his
expﬁriments with more care. This greatly improves the
quality of the research and is of benefit to the research
worker himself”. Dr. John F. Loutit, Director of the

Radiobiological Research Unit at Harwell, wrote that Home ‘

Ofﬁce control ”acts as a stimulus to us to have the highest
quality of animal care and maintenance, which we consider
to be an essential part of a good biological experiment”.
Df- R. J C. Harris, Head of the Division of Experimental
BiOIOgy and Virology of the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund, wrote: ”I would ﬁght to preserve the Home Ofﬁcer
control of animal experiments (as it is now administered)

 

because there. is no doubt that animal work carried on
without such conditions is liable to be fruitless. On the
contrary, I have found that the British system helps legit-
imate research because the advice of the Home Ofﬁce" In-
spectors is available when one is in any doubt about the
conditions ,etc. which are optimum for the particular work
one, has in hand”. Sir Francis Walshe wrote: "I regard
the. British practice as being in the best interests both of
experimentalists and of the animals they use.” Prof.
F. A. E. Crew, F.R.S.,_.wrote: ”I have no hesitation what-
ever .in- answering your questions. In my considered view
the system helps, as do also__the inspectors. It facilitates
and does not impede or hinder”. To the question whether
he would prefer Home Ofﬁce control to be abolished he
replied: "I most certainly would not. I would oppose such
a move with everything I have got . . . I think the ex-
perimental animal should be given protection. I do not
think, that just anybody should be allowed to do just any-
thing with a_ living creature”. Dr. Edward Hindle, F.R.S.,
wrote: "I should be very sorry indeed to see any limita-
tion in the present system of control which has worked so
satisfactorily for more than three-quarters of a century”.
Dr. C. A. Hoare, F.R.S., of the. .Wellcome Laboratories of
Tropical Medicine, wrote: "I believe that — far from
hindering scientific investigations —— the system of licens-
ing and inspection ‘adopted in Britain provides conditions
for research that are beyond reproach”. Prof. A. St. G.
Huggett, F.R.S., physiologist, wrote: ”The Act of 1876
stopsthe frivolous but not the responsible worker”.

A number of our correspondents welcome the fact that
Home Ofﬁce control protects the experimenter as well as
the animal. This is because educated laymen know that
experimenters are not allowed to do just anything to ani-
mals, and I come finally to the question —-— what will be
the impact of the Cooper Bill on American laboratories if
it passes into law?

Of course, everything depends on the quality of the
inspectorate to be appointed. We have been able to ﬁnd
suitable personnel in Britain; let us assume, then, that the
American inspectors will be conscientious, humane, highly
intelligent, practical, and incorruptible, as our inspectors
are considered to be.

On this assumption I venture to express a personal
opinion based partly on this correspondence and partly on
information from other sources. It is that the Cooper Bill,
if passed into law, would have the following effects:

(1) It would restrict experimentation on animals to
persons who are scientifically competent to carry it on;

 

 




 

 

 

(2) It would promote exchange of views among scien-
tists on ways in which suffering in the laboratory can be
reduced to a minimum;

(3) It would promote efficiency by focusing attention
on the statistical and other aspects of methodology;

(4) It would disallow experiments which are ethically
inadmissible.

As regards the last point, let us consider what happens
when a British scientist asks the Home Ofﬁce for permis-
sion to use some new technique which looks as if it might
entail serious suffering. In the ﬁrst place the Home Ofﬁce,
with its scientiﬁc advisers, will try to suggest an alternative
technique which would be free from the disadvantage, and
usually this solves the problem. In the few instances in
which such an alternative cannot be found the Home Office
has to consider, for one thing, the qualiﬁcations of the
applicant. A ﬁrst-rate scientist might be allowed to do
some things which would not be permitted to an inferior
one, but precautions to reduce suffering as much as possi-
ble would be required in any case. All that would be dis-
cussed with the applicant on an expert level, and so far
we have encountered one objection, which I will deal with
shortly. I do not reckon as an objection the following
remark made by Prof. O. E. Lowenstein (after saying ”a
wide range of medical research involving vivisection is
being carried out in Britain, and there is nothing to in-
terfere with the quality of this research provided a good
case has been made out for its necessity”) — ”I myself

have had to give up a line of research in the past because
of difﬁculties in connection with the blinding of ﬁsh, but,
in view of the fact that there are many other things for
me to do, I do not feel seriously frustrated”. Again, Dr.
E. N. Willmer, F.R.S., wrote: ”I see no reason to believe
that the licensing system affects the quality of medical re-
search adversely. It may certainly prevent certain ﬁelds
from being investigated by methods which most of us
would ﬁnd repugnant, but other lines of investigation will
no doubt be found for those areas, which are in any case
small”.

This brings me to that one of our correspondents who
would like to abolish Home Ofﬁce control. He wants to
carry out certain experiments on the brain and considers
that knowledge in this ﬁeld cannot be sufﬁciently got if the
Pain Rule is insisted on. Let us assume that he is right.
In any case, there are some kinds of knowledge which
cannot be got without resort to unethical methods, such
as lethal experiments on human prisoners. The general
tenor of the letters we have received is, with that one
possible exception, in agreement with the following re-
mark made by that distinguished bacteriologist Dr. Leonard
Colebrook, F.R.S., who was formerly on the staff of the
Medical Research Council: "I sup-pose most scientiﬁc peo-
ple who have any compassion would agree that there are
some experiments on animals which are not legitimate”.
