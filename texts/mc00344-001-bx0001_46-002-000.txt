Another Home for the Sea Otter

Hundreds of thousands of sea otters frolicked

along the Paciﬁc Coast until fur hunters decimated
the ranks of Enhydra lutris Nereis in the 19th
Century. Today about 1,400 otters survive along
the California coast from north of Monterey to
,Morro Bay. The otter is designated as a threatened
species, and the US. Fish and Wildlife Service is
obligated to take action to protect it. .
. The greatest threat is that a massive oil spill
would hit the sea otter’s habitat. Unlike other
marine mammals, the otter has no insulating layer
.of blubber, but is buffered from the cold ocean
water by an unusually dense underfur. Even a
partial coating with oil would destroy this protec-
tion, and the animal would die of hypothermia.

The Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing to
“create a new colony of otters on San Nicolas Island,
“the outermost of the Channel Islands, so that the
otter would survive even if the coastal population
‘met with disaster. Seventy otters a year, up to a
total of 250, would be transplanted to San Nicolas,
62 miles offshore. The plan has the support of
,Congress, Friends of the Sea Otter, the staff of
the state Fish and Game Department and others.

2...- .. _ ........~_ .,..._ __

NATIONAL ENQUI RER

The sea otter is one of nature’s most appealing
creatures, and one would not expect the plan to
cause controversy. But the otter thrives on shell-
fish, primarily abalone and sea urchins, so it com- .
petes with commercial and sport ﬁshermen.

Thus ﬁshing groups are expected to oppose the
plan when it goes before the California Fish and
Game Commission for approval on June 24 and
the California Coastal Commission on July 7. The
shellfish catch at San Nicolas Island, valued at an _
estimated $350,000 a year, could be eliminated in
about ﬁve years. .

But the ﬁshing industry would receive a trade—
off that is even more important over the long run:
creation of otter-free zones that would prevent
the coastal otter population from migrating south-
ward and into far richer ﬁshing grounds. Any otter
found moving into the these areas would be caught
and returned to its former habitat.

. This seems reasonable. The proposal for a second
colony has been studied and debated since 1971,
and has broad support. The Fish and Game and
Coastal commissions should have no difficulty in
ratifying this well-considered and worthy project.

Thousands of Americans are

much that the animals become

obese, warns an expert.
Obesity shortens a pet’s life expectancy
and makes it more prone to an array of ill-

nesses —-— but you can beat
the problem by taking some
simple steps, said Dr. Lon
Lewis, adjunct professor of
veterinary medicine at Kan-
sas State University.

Latest research shows one
out of every three dogs and
cats in the US. are obese.
Female dogs are more'likely
to be obese than male dogs
—— and obesity is twice as
common in dogs and cats
that have been. neutered.

Breeds .of dogs that are
most prone to obesity are, in
order: Labradors, cairn ter-
riers, c0cker spaniels, dachs-
hunds, Shetland Sheepdogs,
basset hounds and beagles.

Dr. Lewis says the prob-
lem often begins early in a
pet’s life -- when the owner

 

require less food

 

overfeeds a puppy or kitten.

As animals get older, they
—— yet
many owners continue feed-
ing them the same amount
and the unused calories just
go to fat, said the expert, au-
thor of the book “Small Ani-
mal Clinical Nutrition.”

.“If your pet weighs over
15 percent more now than it
did as a young, healthy
adult, it’s obese,” he said. To
find out if your dog or cat is
obese, place your thumbs on
its backbone and rub your
fingertips back and forth
along its ribs.

“Your pet is thin or nor-
mal if its ribs are easy to

feel. If they’re difficult to

feel, the pet is overweight —
and if its ribs can’t be felt at

all, it’s dangerously obese.”

To beat the problem, first
have your pet examined by a
veterinarian to make sure it
doesn’t have an illness that
causes obesity -- and if it is
merely overweight, take
these steps:

Avoid having food always
available for your dog or cat.

Reduce the pet’s calories

 

 

 

 

by feeding it a low-calorie,
high-fiber diet foOd.

Don’t drastically reduce
your pet’s food intake. It will

just beg and scavenge for

food to satisfy its hunger.

Feed your pet three or
four times daily instead 'of
just one or two big meals.

Encourage regular exer-
cise or play to burn off calo-
ries.

Tell everyone who has
contact with your pet that
you’re trying to keep it on
a weight-reduction program.
That way they won’t give it
treats. -— JEFF HOYT

Code board allows

youth to keep .his
nine pet rabblts.

 

By JON MARCUS
- Staff Writer

Young Jim Edmondson’s bunnies
won’t be banned in Broward County.

But their lives might soon be duller
than they are today.

Late Thursday, Broward’s Code
Enforcement Board decided that
even though he lives in a residential
neighborhood, Edmondson can keep
his nine pet rabbits - as long as they
gigglept apart and not allowed to

 

“It’s better than losing them,” said
Edmondson, 15, whose problems be-
gan to multiply in January after an
anonymous telephone caller told
county officials that his rabbits were
a nuisance.

Things started happing, and the
case became a national cause for
rabbit owners and breeders when the
American Rabbit Breeders Associa-
tion of Bloomington, Ill, sent a letter
of protest to the county.

County building inspectors who in-
vestigated the complaint said keep-
ing rabbits is illegal in the single-fa-
mily neighborhood near Fort
Lauderdale where Edmondson and
his parents moved when they came to
Broward from Toledo, Ohio.

But according to Jeff Miller, an at-
torney who represented the family
without charge, Edmondson pursued
the case because “the rabbits are his
pets. He loves them.”

“It would have been very simple to
tell my son, ‘you have to give it up,’ ”
said Jim Edmondson Sr., the boy’s fa-
ther. “We didn’t need the aggrava-
tion. But it just wasn’t right. -

“I would have bated for my son to
walk out of here and think he’s done
something wrong,” he said.

The rabbits live in specially con-
structed rabbit cages in the Edmond-
sons’ yard. The Code Enforcement
Board did rule that because the cages
violate the local building code, Ed-
mondson will have to rebuild them
within 60 days or face a $50-a-day
fine. He already has applied for the
building permit.

The Code Enforcement Board’s 3-2
decision came after a 41/: -hour hear-
ing that was alternately confronta-
tional and humorous. ' _ .

At one point, Miller asked th
county’s chief zoning inspector,
George Maurer: “You had a pet rab-
bit when you were a kid, didn’t you?”

“That’s irrelevant!” fired back the

everybody equally the same across

Miller used an expert witness,
Broward County Rabbit Association
President Brett Norton, to argue that
there are an estimated 10,000 rabbits
kept as pets in Broward County. Only
one other citation has ever been is-
sued to rabbit owners because of vio-
lations of the building code, officials
said.

 




 

INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE, THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1987

By Erik Eckholm, bird known to have existed: it

Saving a Biological Paradise

New York Times Service
MADAGASCAR, a biological

wonderland in jeopardy, is
now seen by many experts as the
world’s top priority for nature con-
servation. ‘ .

The wildlife of this huge island
off eastern Africa has evolved in
isolation for at least 30 million
years.

Madagascar’s dwindling forests
abound with a thousand orchid
species, more than inhabit all the
African mainland. Half the world’s
chameleon varieties live on this is-
land only. About 1,000 by 300
miles, Madagascar is the sole home
of 142 species of frogs, 106 species
of birds and more than 6,000 spe-
cies of flowering plants.

The island’s 28 surviving species
of lemurs comprise an entire major
branch of primates. Their implor-
ing eyes make them a favorite of
zoo-goers everywhere, but the
small, mostly tree-dwelling, mam-
mals are treasured by anthropolo-
gists because they provide the clos-
est living approximations of the
ancient, squirrel-like ancestors of
modern primates, including human
beings.

But Madagascar’s biological
wealth co-exists uneasily with great
human poverty. The main threat to
wildlife is not furriers, poachers or
loggers. It is farmers who destroy
habitat as they eke out a living,
slashing and burning the forest to
plant crops, cutting trees to obtain
firewood and charcoal for cooking.

The status of lemurs is indica-
tive. Fourteen lemur species have
disappeared since the arrival of hu-
mans l,500 years ago. Now a new
. wave of extinctions — of lemurs
and of unknown numbers of less
visible plants and animals — is
unfolding.

Because of forest clearing by
farmers and, to a much lesser de-
‘ gree, hunting by hungry villagers,
more than one-third of lemur vari-
eties are in severe danger. Known
surviving individuals from some 1e-
mur species number only in the
hundreds, the dozens or, in one
case, three.

Concerned that its natural heri-
tage may be lost, the government of
Madagascar, the Malagasy Repub—
lie, is joining with international
conservation groups to step up the
protection of wildlife. The task is
daunting because the story is essen-
tially one “without villains,” ob-
serves Alison Jolly, a primate ex-
pert at Rockefeller University.

Farming and grazing have left
most of the country’s heartland
bare of trees; only about 20 percent

Clearing of forest for f arming threatens wildlife. .

of Madagascar remains forested.
The biological riches persist in a
fragile necklace of varied habitats
— rain forest along the eastern
coast, a strange spiny desert in the
south and a broken line of decidu-
ous forests along the western coast.‘

“So' much diversity is crammed
into such a tiny area,” marveled
Russell A. Mittermeier, a biologist
with the World Wildlife Fund in
Washington.

The Malagasy government’s ris-
ing commitment to conservation
was evident last month at a meeting
on St. Catherine’s Island, Georgia.
Joseph Randrianasolo, minister of
animal production, waters and for-
ests, joined with other top environ-
mental officials and most of the
world’s lemur experts to discuss
endangered lemurs.

Participants in the meeting
agreed that protection of lemur
habitat in Madagascar was the pri-
mary goal. They also agreed that
many lemur species were so deplet-
ed that an expanded international
program of, captive breeding must
be started immediately.

“Captive populations are insur-
ance, in case the species goes ex-
tinct in the wild,” said Ulysses S.
Seal, an American who chairs an
international group on captive
breeding of endangered species. If
a genetically varied population is
maintained somewhere, then the
species will not perish and it might
someday even be reintroduced to
its natural home.

 

stood l0 feet tall, weighed close to
1,000 pounds and laid 20-pound
eggs.

While ancient lemur remains
have been found elsewhere, the
family died out everywhere but in
Madagascar and the nearby Como-
ro Islands.

Madagascar’sonly primates, the
lemurs fill environmental niches
monkeys and apes occupy in other
tropical regions.‘ And one lemur,
the aye-aye, plays the role of wood-
pecker: it uses its long, spindly
middle finger to extract insect lar-
vae from bark.

The surviving lemurs range in
size from the six-inch mouse lemur,
the world’s smallest primate, to the-
highly endangered indri, which
with a body of nearly three feet is
the largest surviving example of the

so-called lower primates.

“Lemurs provide the best ana- ‘

logs to the early stages of human
, =57; ancestry,” said Elwyn Simons, an
‘ anthropologist and director of the

RA. Mittenneier

The geological history that gave
Madagascar such unique ﬂora and

fauna is poorly known. Whether

the island was ever connected to
Africa is debated, but for 30 mil-
lion or 40 million years at least it
has been far enough from the main-
land to largely prevent the arrival

of alien species on drifting vegeta-'

non.

In isolation, a parallel but differ-
ent world evolved. Ninety-eight
percent of Madagascar’s palm tree
species evolved locally and are
found nowhere else. The same is
true for 80 percent of its ﬂowering
plants and more than 95'percent of
its reptiles. Since birds could ﬂy to
the island from elsewhere, only 40
percent of the island’s bird species
are unique.

Madagascar’s ecosystem gives
scientists a rare chance to see
“which rules would still hold true if
time had once broken its banks and
flowed tothe present down a dif-
ferent channel,” wrote Dr. Jolly in
her book “A World Like Our
Own.”

Humans arrived, apparently
from Indonesia, about 500 AD.
The next 600 years, according to
Alison F. Richard, an anthropolo-
gist at Yale University, saw a major
wave of extinctions. especially of
larger animals. The lost species in-
clude, in addition to 14 lemurs, a
pygmy hippopotamus, two giant
land tortoises and several species of
giant flightless birds. One of these,
the elephant bird, was the largest

i Duke University Primate Center.

Part of the fascination, he said, is
their extreme variety'of behaviors,
which can help illuminate the evo—
lution of social behavior in the an-
Cestral primates 60 million years
ago. In one mouse lemur species,
for example, mothers rear the
young alone.

About 60 percent of lemur spe-
cies are already kept at research
centers and zoos in Europe and the
United States, as well as at the
national zoo in Madagascar. But
many of the species most imperiled
in the wild are not. Experiments in
the captive breeding of several, es- j
pecially leaf4eating species whose
dietary needs have been difficult to
satisfy, have so far failed.

In what conservationists hope
will be a prototype for efforts to
save other forms of wildlife, partic»
ipants at the Georgia meeting
worked out a draft convention to
govern the management of captive
lemurs, under which exports of ani-
mals to foreign centers will be ac-
companied by increased support
for breeding efforts within Mada-
gascar and the training of local per-
sonnel. ' ,

The goal, experts agreed, must be
to establish populations of each
species at several centers. Breeding
records must be shared interna- 4
tionally, with animals moved from
group to group as necessary to pre-
serve ample genetic variation in the
global captive p0pu1ation. _

“We’re not interested in making -
zoo animals,” Dr. Seal said. “We’re
interested in preserving biological
diversity.”

DALLAS MORNING NEWS - June 14, 1987

Dogs give patients a reason to reac

Baylor program uses special canines to facilitate comebaCks from

By Megan Doren
Staff Writer of The News

Therapists had tried everything to get 'a response
from 18-yearold Lorrie, who lay comatose for nine
months after a car accident.

What brought her out of it was something that had to
be sneaked into the hospital in a crate.

Dusty -— who like all dogs was not allowed in a hospi- V

tal - was hidden in an office waiting for his owner, a
therapist, to get off work. Another therapist, remember-
ing that Lorrie used to have a Shetland Sheepdog like
Dusty, decided to try a long shot. 80 they brought Dusty
into Lorrie’s room.

They watched in amazement as Lorrie, for the first
time since the accident, lifted her head and looked at
the dog.

80 started the Pet Facilitated Therapy Program at
Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation last September. Dusty
is now one of seven dogs used mainly with patients who
have head injuries. Many of the patients are comatose.
‘ The goal is to elicit a response from those patients, and
dogs are sometimes better at it than humans.

“It’s been proven that when a person gets a dog, the
blood pressure drops, the pulse settles down, a patient
who is agitated relaxes and the patient’s body functions
better,” said Dr. Lance Bruce, associate medical director
at the Baylor Institute.

Kathryn Schopier, a speech language pathologist, ex-
plained that when people greet each other, it’s a learned
response. But when a person sees a dog, use natural
response to smile and pet the animal. ‘

“When they (the patients) see the dog, they just
brighten up, their facial expressions change, they
smile,” she said, “It’s an automatic response."

Since starting nine months ago, the program has
treated as many as 100 patients. The program coordina~
tor, Shari Bernard, is a registered occupational therapist
and'Dusty’s owner. She also teaches obedience training
at the North Dallas Canine Club. '

All the dogs in the program are privately‘owned.

Sea turtles need help of mankind

rab a‘ flashlight, splash on some

industrial-strength mosquito

repellent and head down to the

beach at night: It’s “Turtle Crawl”
' . season in South Florida.

For the uninitiated, this means that a
fascinating, educational and deeply moving
natural event is taking place after the sun goes
down, along the more isolated and some not-so-
isolated. shorelines.

Every summer, thousands of mother
loggerhead and green turtles — and some rare
half—ton trunkbacks —— crawl ashore on local
beaChes to lay their eggs in the sand. Marine
turtles and turtle eggs are protected by law ,
year-round. '

The turtles’ visit provides an opportunity rare
in nature: a chance for humans to get close to a
shy, wild creature at the most important
moment in her life, when she lays her eggs.

Animal-lovers of all kinds flock to the beaches
at this time of year to witness the miracle of
new life, if they are lucky enough to find a .
turtle.

Children and adults seem to be touched deeply
by the sight of the huge mother turtles, tears
streaming down their faces, struggling to dig a
nest with their hind ﬂippers, dropping dozens of

Ping-Pong ball-sized eggs, covering them up and ~

then scrambling back into the ocean.

Friendly turtle-watchers also serve other
purposes. They protect turtles from cruel or
thoughtless peOple who harass or kill them or
steal their eggs.

And they also provide an opportunity to help
the species thrive, by locating the nests so the
eggs can be moved by park rangers, Florida
Marine Patrol officers or authorized volunteers
to hatcheries or more isolated locations where
they can be incubated. ' .

Without the threat of being washed out to
by high tides, crushed by bathers or beach
vehicles, stolen by people or eaten by raccoons
or other predators, the eggs have a greater
chance of hatching. This allows the babies to
scramble back into the sea, starting the cycle of
life anew.

The turtles are usually deterred by bright
lights, and beachfront development has made
much of their historic habitat less attractive to
them. , Still, some turtles come ashore in highly
populated areas.

Park and recreation officials in coastal cities
with large turtle crawls, like Boca Raton,
Hollywood, Dania and Hallandale, provide
information about the turtles and the laws

- protecting them and sometimes offer guided ' ~

turtle walks, for pe0ple to see and photograph
the egg-laying process. It is an opportunity not
to be missed.

Mankind’s record of interaction with the
animals with which he shares this planet has
often been an unpleasant one, marked by
ignorance, cruelty, overhunting and even the
extinction of entire species

The turtle-watchers and the official turtle-egg

protectors show that there is another side to the "

story: By giving nature a helping hand, mankind
is now helping this animal to survive. . .

In the play, photos of Mus-

While performing in Houston,
the actor resides at a local apart-

Siamese cat, already spayed.
Can’t live with other animals.
Needs a good home,” he said.
Hanket found her in a Lower East
Side apartment and carted her
home on his bike, in a gym bag.

“She was very skittish at first,
shell shocked or something," he
said, flashing a smile.

Paulette didn't seem shy this
morning. She was attacking a pi-
ano wire attached to the televi-
sion set, then flying through the
air after some ﬂuffy, red material
— her baby, Hanket said. The cat
was Spayed at a young age and
sometimes confuses objects like
toy mice and brightly-colored ma-
terial for the babies she never
had.

As she raced past, Paulette's
claws stuck to the carpet, making
her passage difficult. “She has a
weird problem with her claws.
She gets them stuck on stuff,"
Hanket said. “One time I came
home and found her hanging by
her fingernails from the curtain."

Hanket spoke to Paulette in
French again. “i told her she
couldn’t have any drugs (catnip)
right now,” he said.

Besides being a bit of a comic,
Hanket said Paulette is a New
York jet-setter, frequently riding
the subways to attend parties with
him. Often guests hug the cat be-
fore they even notice Hanket, ex-
claiming, “Oh, I met her last
week at a party!”

Hanket said his cat melts away
the cold, New York personality.
Young and old walk up to stroke

When the duo travels by plane
to places like Florida, Alabama,
Missouri and Indiana, the actor
usually has to pay a $25 baggage
fee for Paulette, who's then
checked into the baggage com-
partment in her carrier. However,
on some flights she‘s been per-
mitted to sit in the seat next to
Hanket (except during meals,
when she's returned to her carri-
er). The cat serves as a reminder
of home.

”When I come home, she's al-
ways at the door. She always says
‘Hello‘ (with a meow)” he said.
“She gives me a sense of continu- :
ity and home.”

i Hanket used to haul boxes of

. kitchen utensils and pictures
wherever he went, to capture that
homey feeling. Now he just takes
a couple of books, a few clothes,
his bike —— and Paulette.

' Denver Post Staff Writer

‘ If you'have ever felt inadequate to iden-

_ tify the birds and animals you see during
‘ your travels around Denver or throughout
. [ our state, you belong in the Denver Zoo.

There you can study the resident and
visiting fauna to help you identify what

‘ you may find during your hiking or cycling.
trips. The zoo has a number of Colorado

birds and animals - not all, but enough to
you spot
their brethren in the wild. ’ .
The prim, gaudy peacocks that have the
run of the Denver Zoo aren’t locals, but a
pair of great horned'owls and a couple of
kestrels, both Colorado natives that set up

_' house on the zoo grounds, can be found

around the state.
In fact, when the great horned owls are
in residence — they leave after their off:

. spring fledge (grow enough feathers to

fly) in early May -- there is a sharp in-
crease in the number of severed heads
that waterfowl keep r Rick Haeffner finds
on his morning ro nds. Because great
horned owls are secretive and nocturnal,

those grisly calling cards may be your on:
...ly clue that there are owls near the place
where you’re hiking. .

Kestrels, a delicate, fawn-colored mem-
ber of thefalcon family, are common on

the plains and in the foothills. Occasional-
_ "31y, they’re sighted soaring over the streets
i' r of downtown Denver. A wild pair nested

last year in a cottonwood tree near the
golden eagle’s cage, and the zoo has a resi‘g
dent kestrel, so you can memorize its fea-
tures up close.

When the kestrel’s features are burned

golden eagle’s cage. Golden eagles are
found on the plains and in the foothills:

They’Ve been sighted at Red Rocks, Rox- '

borough Park, the Plains Conservation
Center in Aurora and near the Boulder
Reservoir. '

The turkey vulture], a huge black bird '

with bright red from the crest of its head
to its beak, also is common in Colorado,

and there are two near the 200’s golden

eagle. Turkey vultures, eagles and hawks
often are found in the same areas in the
wild -— foothills, high prairie, mountains.
It’s easy for inexperienced bird watchers
to confuse a ﬂying turkey .vulture with ea-
gles or immature red-tailed hawks, partic—
ularly at a distance. If the wings are held
in a V, it’s probably a turkey vulture. Ea-
gles and hawks, which also are larger than
turkey vultures, tend to soar with their
wings held flat. »

A large colony of black-crowned night
hawks -- perhaps the largest colony in the

most prolific birds at the zoo. The geese I

are so prolific that their goslings are
rounded up each year for relocation.

Black-tailed prairie dogs have their own
exhibit at the 200, a humble mound of
earth that is sort of a prairie dog condo.
There are hundreds of black-tailed prairie
dogs in the metro area, including families
alongside the east runways of 'Stapleton
airport, and countless colonies in eastern
suburban areas and the plains.

Among the large Colorado animal na-
tives that are represented at the zoo are
bighorn sheep, mule deer, antelope and
elk. Bighorn sheep can be found in the

mountains and parks, including Rocky

Mountain National Park. It’s rare for big-
horn sheep to bear twins like those at the
zoothis year. Mule deer, antelope and elk
all roam within an hour’s drive of Denver.

* Two weeks ago, there were mule deer and

, elk grazing just north of El Rancho at‘

state, according to the 200’s education di- f

rector, William Taylor - nests on the is-
land in the middle of the small lake that
the zoo shares with the rest of City Park.
Between March and September, the
black-crowned night heron is found
throughout Colorado, usually near water.
Other Colorado birds-that are perma-

nent or temporary residents at the zoo in»

clude Brewer’s blackbirds, the black-billed
magpies, house sparrows, robins, mallard
ducks, Cooper’s hawks and sharp—shinned

Though there are cottontail rabbits, tiny

don’t believe in unnecessary killing and maiming of
animals,” says Jenifer Graham, a 15-year-old biology stu-
dent in Victorville, Calif. Consequently, she refused to
dissect a frog, a high-school biology assignment She told
school officials she objects to the wholesale raising and cap-
ture of frogs and other animals for laboratory specimens.
instead Jenifer, an A-student in biology until the controversy,
pleaded with officials to allow her to use alternatives such as a
plastic model or computer simulations to study frog anatomy.
School officials say that since the biology class is not a
requirement. Jenifer should fail any portion in which she
refuses to participate; they offered to transfer her to a biology -
_ class that does not require dissection. She refused. Then they
said Jenifer would not be required to dissect but that her
"transcripts would indicate she had passed biology without
doing so; she protested this compro- '
‘ mise as well. “If we granted an ex-
ception, we would have to grant any
number of exceptions,” says school
trustee Claude Noel. “Now, for exam- _
ple, some students try every excuse
in the world to get out of phys ed
because they don’t want it or don’t
like it.”
In comparing Jenifer’s refusal to
dissect frogs with the excuses of re-
luctant gym students, school officials ‘
fail to see that the issue is about the proper use of animals in
education. They apparently see frogs as equal to any other
laboratory supply, such as glassware, that schools buy for
biology students. So for them, killing frogs to educate students
is no different from consuming lab chemicals for the same
purpose. Although such attitudes toward animals are common,
they have little moral foundation. -

While defenders of animal experimentation might claim
that including frogs in our ethical system is nonsense since
they are lower animals, this response fails to explain why we
should overlook the killing and suffering of lower animals.
'Since frogs are capable of feeling pain and suffering - they
,have a central nervous system and frog behaviors such as
winclng and writhing indicate pan — we must have good
reasons for killing or causing them suffering Otherwise teach-
ers, who are role models for students, are demonstrating
callousneesandindifference toward misery. Pain is an evil, .;,

ciples And Frogs

whether in humans or animals.

. And since we are also careful to teach young children
respect for their pets, consistency requires the same respect
for animals in their education. 80 an important lesson for
students, along with the usual ones about the size of a frog
liver or the number of frog vertebrae, is how to use a frog

, appropriately to discover such facts.

This is not to argue that animals should not be used for
learning. What we need is a moral calculus to measure educa-
tional benefits versus animal costs. Sometimes what we are

' teaching is so important, and no alternatives exist, that we are

right in killing animals; other times this is not the case. If a

surgeon is learning how to sew small blood vessels in order to

reattach a hand severed in an accident, this is a good reason
to learn such skills by severing and reattaching animal limbs.

But is killing frogs necessary in order to teach frog anato-

my? This is the educational and moral issue that the Victor-

ville school officials are avoiding.

Students learn just as much — possi-

bly more -— about frog anatomy by

examining models, slides and video-

tapes as they do by conducting their

own frog dissection. The school offi-

cials in this case even turned down

an offer from a Hollywood special

effects artist to produce a videotape

of a frog dissection. This shows that

they are committed to repetitive frog

dissection and the accompanying at-

7_ titude that frogs are morally insignificant.

Reliable estimates are that in excess of 60 million animals a
year are subjected to experiments in the United States. And
while some animal experimentation has been of considerable
benefit to humans, Jenifer’s school district is not atypical in its
unnecessary use of frogs and in its reluctance to change.
Indeed, the history of animal experimentation is replete with
useless, repetitive and cruel experiments.

Applying a conservative requirement that we assess wheth-
er there is a non-animal alternative and whether the object of
the experiment is worth killing an animal would do much to
reduce such numbers. We would teach biology just as effec-
tively and in addition teach valuable moral lessons about the
worth of animals. Teachers need such lessons more than some
of their students.

Adding a Pet Goes a Long Way
In Subtracting Living-Alone Blues

By DEAN CARROLL

If you’re a senior citizen in search of a
_ magic potion to help ease those pangs of
loneliness, why not consider a stroll

through your neighborhood pet store?
A pet may be just the ticket to chase
away those “I’m all alone” blues. Many
‘ psychologists say pets provide the affec-
“22d and companionship elderly people

n .

“Unlike humans, animals offer uncondi-
tional love and affection which makes
them ideal companions,” says Patricia
St. John, a teacher in Evanston, 111., and'

eral studies into the human—companion .

At that point, a citywide police
bulletin was sent out, according to
Capt. Michael Gardner of the Mid-
town North precinct. Five hours later,
a patrol officer, Thomas A. Cassidy, ,
spotted the truck parked on Walton
Avenue near 180th Street in‘ the Bronx,
and called in reinforcements.

“I looked out my window and there
must have.been 11 police cars and all
these police on the Hertz truck,” said.
Yolanda Ruiz, 29, of 2028 Walton Ave-’
nue. “I figured there was a body in
that truck or some drugs.”

But the cargo turned 'out to be the
two l85-pound cubs, named SigRoy
and Vegas, in large cages. The truck
was then escorted to the Midtown,
Precinct police station by the many
reporters and television camera-
crews who had converged on the par-
tially abandoned block. . ﬁ
' “I suppose that if we want to get rid
of that crack spot down the street, we
need to rent some tigers from‘the

others in the crowd expressed anger;
that, after all the fuss, the tigers
would not be brought back to the

Cate debate

Neighbors lament zoo traffic jams , . '

traffic was backed up for about 11/2 '

By GEORGEA KOVANIS
Free Press Staff Writer

The Detroit Zoo officially opens its
new Woodward Ave. entrance Friday
with clowns, a 10 am. ribbon-cutting
ceremony. bands and a balloon
launch. Mayor Young is scheduled to
attend, and will get a key to the new
gate. ‘

But not everybody is excited.

In the Pleasant Ridge and Royal
Oak neighborhoods surrounding the
i zoo, residents are worried that cars
using the new entrance will cause
. more traffic tie-ups in an area of
Woodward where traffic already has
i been clogged by construction on the I-
‘ 696 expressway.

_ “That’s our main concern, that
traffic’s going to back up and it’s
going to be a hazard,” said Ron Clark,
39, one of the Royal Oak residents
' who lives near the new zoo entrance.
. "On Memorial Day, he said, zoo

miles along Woodward between 1
pm. and 6 pm. because there weren’t
enough parking spots.

State transportation officials in-
volved in the construction of 1-696,
which runs just south of the zoo, have
said the zoo is losing more than 250
parking spaces because of the con-
struction. Zoo officials acknowledged
Wednesday that the zoo has lost some
auxiliary parking off its grounds, but
did not have an exact figure.

Zoo marketing director Pat

McClary said the zoo has to be tempo-
rarily closed to cars when the 1,100

spaces in its parking lot and the 600 in ,

the new garage are full.

The new entrance, landscaping
and the parking garage cost the zoo
nearly $12 million.

On Memorial Day, Clark said, cars
were parked in no-parking areas
along residentialstreets.

MEMPHIS, FRIDAY, JUNE 5, 1987

Quarters
readied
for visit
of panda

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

 

———7

The mess in the monkey house
wasn’t caused by big apes this
time.

The primates chipping con-

'crete and breaking walls in the
Primate House at the Memphis
Zoo yesterday were city employ-
ees. They were modifying the
building to make it ready for the

‘ giant panda from Mexico City.

The panda, scheduled to ar-
rive Aug. 1, will live in the gor-

.illa exhibit during its month-
long stay in Memphis. The ex-
hibit’s concrete outdoor yard,
which is surrounded by a moat,
will be converted to a grassy
field with a pool. The moat will
be filled in, which will almost
double the size 'of the exhibit,
and a wall with windows will be
built to separate visitors from
animal. -

The gorillas -— Rocky, Tammy
and Kwashi —— will live in an in-
door exhibit until the panda ar-
rives, at which time they will be
moved to a holding area in the
zoo hospital so the panda can
have access to both of the goril-
las’ inside exhibit spaces.

Although the great apes may
be restless for a while, they prob-
ably'will be happy when they see
their home after .the panda
leaves, said zoo director Charles
Wilson. “When the gorillas come
out and find'grass and a wading
pool, they’ll go berserk,” he said.

Plans by the John J. Heirigs
Construction Co. call for a 12-
foot wall to be built around the
outside of the exhibit. The wall
will include 10 panes of laminat-
ed, gorilla-proof safety glass,
which will provide visitors with

more than 40 feet of viewing
space, Wilson said. A metal play-
ground “pagoda” —— a circular
type of jungle gym with a Chin-
ese-type roof -—-— will replace the
outdoor monkey bars during the
panda’s stay. A slide from the pa-
goda will lead to an outdoor
pool, and an indoor pool also is
being built.

Cost of the project will be
about $85,000, Wilson said.

her will be in the morning, Wil-
son said. In Mexico, the panda is
taken indoors in the .afternoon'
because of the heat, and it is like-
ly Mexican zoo officials will re-

But Mexican officials are con-
centrating more closely on an-
other panda matter right now:

Cheetah. Cubs

By Lori Berry

Two month-old cheetahs frustrat-
ed the diligent efforts Friday of vis- .
itors and press photographers to
scrutinize them at the St. "Louis Zoo.

The birth May 10 of the cubs -- a
male and a female — caused quite
,a stir at the Zoo. They are the first
offspring born in the 200’s Cheetah
Survival Center to a mother also
born at the center.

“This birth is of unusual signifi-
cance to us,” said Charlie Hoessle,
Zoo director. “Not only is any cap-
tive breeding of cheetahs rare, but
this is the third generation of chee-
tahs to be bred in captivity on the
mother’s side and the second gen-
eration bred on the father’s side.”

Cheetahs are the fastest land
mammal — they can travel faster
than the state’s new 65 mph speed
limit. But they are much slower

tributed to their endangered status.

said.

Visitors to the 200 have been try-
ing to get a glimpse of the young
critters, who avoid the public by
lounging beneath one of several
trees in the man-made survival
center. “But they’ll be running
around and playing soon,” said In-
grid Porton, assistant curator of
primates and Children’s Zoo
supervisor.

The cubs weighed only about a
pound each when they were born.

Sukari, the mother, relaxed in

the shade Friday with the cubs. She .

was hand-raised in the Children’s
200 with her three siblings.

'Porton said Sukari is “the best of

; both worlds" as a mother. “She’s

have-come out of the hand-rearing
process with the normal behaviors
(breeding and mothering instincts)
of the female cheetah,” she said.
Sukari watched her cubs as visi-
tors strained to see the animals.
Then she wandered closer to the
visitors to loll in another shady spot

. while leaving her cubs behind in

their cool, camouflaged spot.
“In the wild, cheetahs spend 90
percent of the day resting; they

don't waste energy,” said "Steve

Bircher, assistant curator of mam-
mals and supervisor of carnivores.
They expend energy hunting for

food, he said. '

The birth of the two cubs raised
the number of cheetahs born in the
survival center since its opening 13 .-
years ago to 23, Bircher said. i

The captive breeding. program is
part of a species survival plan de-
vised by the American Association
of Zoological Parks and Aquariums,
of which the St. Louis 200 is a

other zoos for breeding, Bircher

SICSA hopes you can t reSISt little guys

Auction shopping can be lots of fun, particularly
1 when your purchase benefits the community.

Two of Dayton’s major auctions are coming up and
jboth provide a chance to get some great buys as well
make an important contribution to our town.

We’ve recently celebrated “Be Kind to Animals

Week” and surely there’s no group in town that looks
after strays as consciensciously as SICSA, the Soci-
ety for the Improvement of Conditions for Stray
Animals.
. Last year the group raised $12,000 at its summer
auction, with proceeds going to provide temporary
homes and spay / neutering for stray animals. In addi-
tion to the 20 cats and 20 dogs which are housed on
the premises, SICSA searches to find good foster
homes for as many as 300 more cats and dogs.

The Sicsa Auction , this year renamed A Bloomin’
Auction and Dinner, will be Sunday, June 7, at Cox
Arboretum, 6733 Springboro Pike.

What makes this event unique? While some orga-
nizations fill their runways with beauty contestants
or local celebrities, a highlight of this auction is the
Pet Parade.

. “After the silent auction and before dinner, we
have a parade of all the cats and dogs which are
adoptable at that time, ” explains SICSA volunteer
Patsy Gerlinger. “We do the same thing at our annual
fashion show.’

' While the animals are parading, the “commenta-
tor” shares some information about each one.“ Al-
most all of them get adopted afterward, ” says Mrs.
Gerlinger. “People come home and tell their friends
about a particular dog or cat, and we get calls about
them.”

-. .Another unusual aspect of the auction is the num-
ber of animal-related products which are sold during
the evening. Here’s the chance to stock up on dog
food, pet goodies, stuffed animals, kitty dishes.

TAMPA TRIUNE 6/4/87

Emergency

pet line

a o o '
cntrerzed.
By JIM SLOAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — A local animal wel-
fare activist blasted Hillsborough
County’s after-hours emergency line
for sick or injured pets Wednesday,
saying dispatchers who answered
residents’ calls were “belligerent”
and “brusque. ”

Animal Protection ALeague Di-
rector Jacqueline Gibson then pre-
sented the commission with a $435
veterinarian’s bill — the cost, she
said, of saving a dog the county’s

, animal pound had refused to help.

Gibson’s complaints involved

,Hillsborough County Animal Con-

trol’s emergency line, used to dis-
patch help for animals injured or
gravely ill when the pound is
closed.

Gibson said she was contacted
by a woman whose daughter’s dog
was hit by a car in April. The wom-

 

 

 

 

lan told her she had called the

pound’s emergency line, but was
told that the dog’s owner must make
a request for help.

“That’s not true,” Gibson said in
an interview later. _

The woman ’5 daughter refused
to call, Gibson said. As a result, the
Animal Protection League picked
up the dog and took it to the veteri-
narian. She presented the commis-
sion with a $435 veterinarian’s bill.

The emergency line is answered
by county fire department radio dis-
patchers at the Bureau of Emergen-
cy Management, who dispatch .an
Animal .Control truck to handle
after-hours emergency calls.

The commission referred Gib-

son’s bill to the county attorney and

her request for training and monis
toring of emergency line dispatch-
ers to the county administrator.

. Public Works Director Gil Ro-
driguez said emergency line opera-
tors routinely get 100 calls to help

,sick or injured animals between 8
a. m. and 5 p. m. on Saturdays.

Limited range of animal lab tests regulated

testing ordinance does not restrict
the tragic way street rodents are
commonly destroyed.

The ordinance does not con-
cern itself with all of the many
and varied forms of animal abuse.
which seems somehow less rel-
evant than thefact that Lettvin
himself proposed nothing that
would reduce the suffering of ro-
dents in the streets of Cambridge,
something he claims Concern for.

All said, one wonders if the pro-
fessor’s real concern is not the
Testing Ordinance, but the pend-
ing Responsibility Ordinance,
»~ which would allow the citizens of
Cambridge to examine how he
treats the animals in his laborato-
ry (something which cannot hap-
pen at present).

I am writing in response to the
Jerome Y. Lettvin’s May 27 op-ed
criticizing the work of the Cam— '
bridge Committee for Responsible
Research.

The Testing Ordinance, passed
by the Cambridge City Council to
reduce unnecessary animal suffer—
ing, limits commercial-product
testing on animals. It does noth-
ing to impede or limit testing in
pure and applied medical re-
search. It is therefore hard to un-
derstand Lettvin’s closing remark
that the Testing Ordinance
“schackles biological and medical
research."

Lettvin defines rodent control
as “exterminational research.” He
then claims that the CCRR must
‘ be less than noble in its desire to ‘
further animal welfare, since the

The Sea World penguins
strut their stuff.

 

 

PENGUINS 0N
PARADE .

 

 

eginning June 13, more than

300 lively, lovable penguins
and over 100 alcids (waterfowl
related to penguins but native to the
Arctic zone) can be viewed by the
public in their new Central Florida
home. .

The $13 million Penguin Eno
counter is the largest and most
technically advanced exhibit of its
kind in the world. So realistic, it
even snows inside.

The facility is comprised of the
Penguin Exhibit with its icy Antarc—
tic seapools and recreated rocky ter—
rain of the subantarctic, an Alcid
Exhibit presenting seabirds and
other aquatic life of the Arctic, and
a Learning Hall which showcases
discovery of the polar regions and
research that has made the Penguin
Encounter a reality.

A blast of chilly air greets guests
upon entering. Stepping onto a

 

120—ft. moving sidewalk puts them
close up and personal with man’s
favorite formally attired feathered
friends’ stately king penguins, Anv
tarctic Adelies, seemingly hand—
painted chinstraps, gentle gentoos,
bounding rockhoppers and comical
macaronis.

Stepping off the moving sidewalk,
guests may either move to an
unstructured viewing area to enjoy
the birds at their leisure, or may
proceed to the Learning Hall. Here,
video monitors provide fascinating
film footage of Sea World’s explora—
tion of the polar regions, as well as
research of the birds themselves.

Moving to the Alcid Exhibit,
guests come face—tdface with more
than 100 puffins, murres and
auklets— birds native to the Arctic,
and while not related to penguins,
are considered to be their ecological
counterpart.

The Penguin Encounter is located
on a Seacre site between the Whale
and Dolphin and the Sea Lion and

SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE - June 1987

From story "A Close watch on U.S. Bo¢rders to keep the world's bugs out".

Augmenting the work of human inspectors and high
technology, APHIS also relies on eight beagles—one of
them named Dr. Watson. At the command of “KILL!”
he won’t. At 20 pounds, his biggest enemy is falling
luggage. “I have to be careful about that,” says Mike
Simon, 31, his boss. As the morning's ﬂights arrive,
he gets “Doc" Watson from his truck. (Another bea-
gle, Sherlock, works the earlier shift with another
handler.) Simon vigorously rubs Doc M7atson’s ears
and sides. “Get ﬁred up! Get ﬁred up!” He gives the

dog a quick walk around the back of the terminal
building, then slips on Doc Watson’s uniform, a green
coat with white letters. On one side it reads “Agricul-
ture’s Beagle Brigade”; on the other, “Protecting
American Agriculture.” “His tail is up, you can tell
he’s happy,” says Simon. He talks about managing Doc
Watson in much the same way an executive might talk
after a course in human relations: “Motivation moves
down the leash."

With the beagle out front, his nose rising and fall-
ing, the two make their way around one of the baggage
carousels. From time to time the dog sticks his head
deep inside a shopping bag. When he smells contra-
band, he sits down and looks up at Simon with big
watery brown eyes. More precisely, the dog looks about
halfway up Simon at a small green pouch strapped to
his waist. This is where Simon stores Doc’s salary, bits
of dog food doled out each time he makes a good “hit.”
Given only one meal a day, he makes up the rest of his
ration this way.

Doc Watson thinks he has got something in the at-
taché case of a businessman. He sits.

“What kind of food do you have in there?” Simon
asks. He seldom asks a yes or no question, for no is too
ready an answer. Surprised, the man bends down,
opens his briefcase and displays an apple. Although
just one piece of fruit, this ﬁnd is signiﬁcant. “We never
would have gotten him without the dog,” says Simon,
who explains that businessmen don’t ﬁt the proﬁles of
travelers known to bring in food. The dogs, he says,
are especially useful, therefore, on European ﬂights.

As Doc Watson makes his rounds, wisecracks follow.
“Oh, a guard beagle!” exclaims one woman. “Watch
out,” quips an American at the carousel; “it’s trained
to kill.” But children reach out with splayed ﬁngers.
Two Japanese women take turns snapping pictures of
each other posing with the dog in their laps.

It is Doc Watson’s appeal, not his nose, that causes
the downfall of a German student. He spots the beagle
and comes right over to scratch his ears and belly. Doc
stands on his hind legs to greet him. “Reminds me of
my dog back home,” he says. “Only mine is black.”
The young man whips a wicker basket off his back and
pulls out a little something for the dog. “Can I?” he
asks. “No,” says Simon—then he does a double take.
“What is that?”

“A hot dog.”

Contraband.

“What else do you have in there?” Simon asks. Final '
score: two hot dogs and a package of salted meat.

between 1883 and 1918. But in the last fiVe ’ '
years, a few wolves have crossed the border .-
from. Canada and returned to Montana. .
Naturalists say there may be 25,000 more in
Canada and Alaska and 1,200 in Minnesota.
The federal government’s current 99-page
plan, on the drawing boards for ﬁve years and
" twice revised, will be forwarded to Washington, j.
'D.C., later this month with extensive '
comments. It is expected to be signed this
summer, said Galen Buterbaugh, regional . i
director of the US. Fish and Wildlife Service in ,
Denver. ’ ’ . ' .
‘ He estimates that it will cost taxpayers '— r _
“somewhere between $250,000 and $750,000” ' ,.
to catch, tag, radio-tag and vaccinate wolves
and reintroduce them into the parks in
Wyoming and Idaho, he said. ‘ i -
Although Buterbaugh said proponents see
the plan as “a mandate for everything to '
carried out immediately, that is not true. It is
merely a guideline.” And, he said, it will be “a
_ minimum of another ﬁve years, at the very .
least” before wolves are loosed in Yellowstone. , .~ »
Planners want to establish 10 breeding pairs 5 .

and attack sheep or cattle.

"Our forefathers decided to get
rid of the wolves because they
weren’t compatible with raising
livestock,” said John Baucus, who
is chairman of the Montana ,
Woolgrowers Association’s predator
committee, and whose family raises
5,000 sheep near Wolf Creek, Mont.

He added, “Most livestock people
don’t see a problem if the wolves
stay within the parks, but the
wolves won’t because they don’t
know where the boundaries are and
can’t read the signs.”

Officials of all three states
bordering the proposed wolf parks
oppose the current plan because
they say it still lacks ironclad

. provisions for protecting livestock _

‘ from wolves.

Montana Gov. Ted Schwinden
wants assurances that there will be
enough money to pay for the
reintroduction and eventual
management before the wolf

program starts. Glenn Erickson,
manager of Montana’s wildlife
bureau, fears wolves will disrupt

mature and reduce game herds.

Using federal figures, Erickson
estimates "10 breeding pairs of
wolves and their accompanying
packs could consume, on a yearly
basis, in excess of 1,000 elk.”
Wolves also eat moose, white-tailed

deer and beaver in the spring.

Although no wolves have been
sighted in Wyoming for nearly ~50
years, they still are listed as
predators, said Al Langston of the
Wyoming Department of Fish and
Game. But the federal endangered
species listing takes precedent, so
legally they cannot be shot,
Langston added.

Officially known as the Northern
Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery
Plan, the wildlife proposal initially
was prepared four years ago by the
US. Fish and Wildlife Service in

‘ cooperation with the Northern

Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery
Team.

One team member who opposed
the immediate reintroduction of
wolves to Yellowstone was a man

0 who has studied wolves in the

Rocky Mountains for more than a
decade. Robert Ream, an ecologist,
professor and member of the

‘ : Montana Legislature, began

studying wolves in 1973. Six years
later, Joe Smith, one of his
colleagues, trapped and put a radio
collar on a lone female wolf on the
Canadian-Montana border.

Ream and his wolf watchers kept
track of her along the border and
inside Glacier National Park for
two years before they foundthe

tracks of a second wolf, which was

 

missing his fourth toe.

In the spring of 1982, Phyllis, as
researchers called her, had a litter
of seven pups. In the process, she
earned a place in the history books
because they believe she is the first
wolf to breed in the western United
States in nearly half a century.

Dubbed "the magic pack” by
researchers because of their .
elusiveness, the group first lived
north of the border in British
Columbia. It then moved south, into
Glacier. Today Ream said there are
15 to 20 wolves in the park,
including the magic pack in the
northwest, three or four others On "

the eastern side of the park, and a, ' \

few lone wolves.

"As far as I know, they all came
from that original litter,” Ream
said. '

if we wait another five to 10 years 3
before we bring them in to i

Day ceremonies at St. Chrysostom’s Episcopal
Church, 1424 N. Dearborn Pkwy.

Animal lovers count their blessings ‘

By John Hechinger

In Sunday’s chill, they clutched
restless bundles of fur and feathers,
anxiously awaiting a religious expe-
nence.

Stormy skies recalled visions of
Noah’s Ark as more than 100 pet
owners and animal lovers gathered
at St. Chrysostom’s Episcopal
Church, 1424 N. Dearborn Pkwy.

Among the honored guests were
Clarence the poodle, Udell the cat
and Sassi the mutt.

On a gothic terrace overlooking a
stone courtyard overﬂowing with
fuzzy heads, Rev. Robert L. Howell,
in a general blessing, called on the
lord to “bless, keep and protect the
animals of the world with thy grace
and benediction“

It was Rogation Sunday at St.
Chrysostom’s. For 20 years, the
leaders of the congregation have cel-
ebrated this annual blessing of the
ﬁelds and animals. The modern cer-
emony datesback to the 4th Centu-
ry, when a Roman Catholic bishop
set aside three holy days for the
protection of plants and animals
after a volcano destroyed a diocese
in Vienne, a small town in France.

In an increasingly urban America,
few ”Christian denominations con-

”. 3 , . “J; -.

tinued the celebration of Rogation
Days, which begin the ﬁfth Sunday
after Easter. ’ ,

Nostalgia 'for an agrarian past
adds to the day’s attractions, ac-
cording to leaders of the event.
“Here in Chicago, it really catches
hold because we have so much less
contact with the earth, ” Rev.
Howell said. “People here are more
excited about the day than at any
place I’ve ever been.”-

That enthusiasm was evident as
owners took pooches in arms for a
personal blessing from Rev. George
A. Hull. .

Wearing flowing white ec-
clesiastical robes and a ready smile,
Rev. Hull pronounced the solemn
words: “Dear God, we thank you
for the life of Sassi that he may
continue to grow with the love of

life that you offer all your crea-q

tions.”

' Dressed in a T-shirt bearing the
inscription V.I.P.——Very Important
Puppy—Sassi, a brownish mongrel,
seemed unmoved. But her owner,
Mary Walker, of the Near North
Side, said blessings play a vital role
in the life of her hound, whose
mixed ancestry she called “one of
God’s mysteries.” Her next trip, she

said, will be to the Cathedral of St.
John the Divine in New York,
where 11-year-old Sassi will receive
yet another benediction. '

The crowd surrounding Rev. Hull
included Chicago residents, and
pets, of all denominations.

Even some exotic creatures lined
the church courtyard. There was a
4-year—old Great Pyrenee, a ﬂuffy
white canine weighing 120 pounds.
And each year the Lincoln Park
Zoo adds a few creatures to the
pious menagerie. This year, Martha
Doerrer, a volunteer and guide for
the 200, had Philly the crow
perched on her hand. Her two assis-
tants cradled in their arms Molly
the rabbit and Amie the armadillo.

As pets and owners waited their
turns, there were some muffled
yelps and an occasional bark, but
the crowd was generally orderly.

Perhaps the animals were in-
timidated by the considerable police
presence. Clark Schroeder of the
Chicago Police Canine Unit
brought lLyear-old Cody, his Ger-
man shepherd and live-in room-
mate. And two police horses stood
regally on North Dearborn
Parkway, taking part in the ceremo-

ny.

AND AUTISM

HILE THE CONTROVERSY
m over the use of aversive

therapy—such as am-
monia spray vapor and white
noise—in the treatment of au-
tism continues, Patricia St.
Iohn is using dolphins to dem-
onstrate that it is possible to
penetrate the mysterious world
inhabited by autistic children.
The 41-year-old founder and
director of Mid-Point, a non-
profit research foundation in
Bridgewater, Connecticut, says,
“The ability of dolphins to uti-
lize all their sensory signals is
what gave me my start.”

Back in May of 1983, St.
lohn gave a guest lecture on
dolphin communication to a
group of high school journal-
ism students in New Milford,
Connecticut. One of the stu-
dents said that the behavior St.
Iohn described reminded her of
her autistic brother’s behavior.
St. John decided to check it out.
Climbing into a dolphin tank,
she discovered that by being
passive and by letting the dol-
phin take the lead, eventually it
approached her. In fact, it be-

gan to circle her and then back
toward her until it established
contact. Later, she was intro—
duced to an autistic child. As
St. John waited silently, the boy
began to circle her. Finally, he
backed toward her and sat
down in her lap.

St. John has worked with
many autistic children over the

 

past four years and is con-
vinced that a link exists be-
tween their sensory world and
that of dolphins. “Traditionally,
it was believed that [the autis-
tic] are walled off,” she says.
“But they’re not; they’re over-
stimulated and don’t know
how to filter [the stimuli] out.
Once this is understood by

teachers and parents, an inter-
active situation can be created
where children will choose to
communicate.”

St. Iohn has a number of
projects in the works, including
a ﬁlm documenting her theor-
ies. It is being made this sum-
mer in collaboration with the
Boston University Film Unit.
Entitled Response, the ﬁlm will
juxtapose human interaction
with a pod of Stenella dolphins
in their natural habitat and St.
Iohn’s interaction with an autis-
tic child. She hopes eventually
to bring dolphins and autistic
children together to see if the
mammals will draw the chil-
dren out.

In the meantime, St. John
has set up a sensory-awareness—
training workshop at ARCH-
way, a residential facility in
Leicester for autistic children
and adults, where trainees are
exploring different forms of
nonverbal communication.
Says ARCHway executive di-
rector Ellen Price, “I’m not sure
whether [her approach] works
better than other types of treat-
ment, but if she can raise en-
thusiasm among our staff—
and she has—I’m all for it.”

'Make war, not love for.N.C. red wolves, coyotes

United Press International

MANTEO, N.C. — Federal officials are requesting
that four more red wolves be released in eastern North
Carolina so that the appearance of coyotes nearby does
not disrupt the project to reintroduce the rare wolves
into the wild.

Coyotes were sighted within 100 miles of the por-
tion of the Dare County Alligator River Wildlife Refuge
where four pairs of wolves are set to be released next
month and two pairs in the fall.

- Officials are worried that the wolves may cross-
breed with the coyotes and disrupt the plan to raise the
p0pulation of the endangered red wolf. But if two more
\ pairs of wolves, or 16 altogether, enter the wild, offi-

cials hope the wolves will become territorial and fight

the coyotes rather than mate with them.
“What we’re going to do in Dare County is double

up on the number of pairs we’re going to bring in this
fall to give a boost to the red wolf pOpulation,” said
Warren Parker, project director for the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

“This is based on the supposition that once they es-
tablish their territory, the coyotes will not invade,” he
told the News and Observer of Raleigh.

Officials said the coyotes spotted in Dare County
may have been brought to eastern North Carolina by

‘ hunters from the western part of the country.

“So far as we know, they [coyotes] do not occur
there naturally but were brought in,” said biologist
Randy Wilson. “Out West, it’s a sport to hunt coyotes,
and there might have been some individuals who want-
ed to try it in North Carolina.

Wilson said it was difficult to tell how many coy-
otes are roaming in sparsely papulated Dare County.

UP Casket maker
provides pets with
final resting place

By BOB CAMPBELL
Free Press Staff Writer \

GLADSTONE —— Small caskets are big busi-
ness for Dennis and Jeanne Hoegh, who last year
sold 30,000 lace-trimmed coffins —- for dogs,
cats, parakeets and pigs.

And the Hoeghs sell more than that from their
sprawling Upper Peninsula plant: They’ve got
plastic urns for cremated pets, and exclusive
rights to “Pro-Long Powder,” which is sprinkled
on pet bodies to delay decomposition until burial.

“Every year, 10 or 12 competitorstry to get
started, but no one else has survived,”
Dennis Hoegh, who says his company of 14
employes is “the World’s largest pet casket
manufacturer.”

Orders have gone to Australia, South Africa
and Europe.

Each 10- to 40-inch casket comes with a
pillow, lace, padding and crepe lining, while
deluxe caskets sport extra padding, silk lining
and and color co-ordinated lace. The caskets cost
from $7 to more than $200.

_ HOEGH, 53, said he got the idea for his
business when a wealthy owner of champion
racing dogs for whom he worked wanted to buy
a fine casket for a dog that had died. Unable to
find one, the man built one himself.

“I found the old prototypes and thought there
were a lot of people out there who don’t know
what to do with their pets when they die,” he

said. “But it was many, many years of starvation
before we started making money’ '

In his first year, sales were $1, 500. Last year,
Hoegh Industries Inc. —— based near Escanaba —
had sales of $540, 000, more than twicetheir 1979
figures.

( The company’s growth has paralleled that of
pet cemeteries across the country. Philadelphia,
Hoegh said, now has 13 pet Cemeteries.

The Hoeghs say they enjoy their work be-

cause they never know what special request
each day will bring.

Their best-remembered order came from
Florida in 1979. A popular ring-necked pheasant
nicknamed Charlie Lindbird —- who had a
penchant for racing alongside planes landing and
taking off at Craig Field —-— came too close to a
propeller one morning.

“They ordered a 24-inch casket and
held a service for Charlie,” Hoegh said.
A press clipping of the funeral reported
that several of the pilots flew the
“missing man” formation to honor the
departed bird.

In addition to their manufacturing
business, the Hoeghs also are skilled
promoters of the business that keeps
them in business:

0 Three times in the past nine years
they have hosted the annual meeting of
the International Association of Pet
Cemeteries.

0 They have sold more than 15,000
copies of a pet cemetery how-to book.

0 Behind their plant in a grassy,

walled-in courtyard, the Hoeghs have
made a “model pet cemetery,” come .
plate with stone and brass headstonesilg

HOEGH ACKNOWLEDGED that .
not everyone needs to bury their pet in
a casket. But some people can ease the
separation by giving their furry or
feathered friends a more dignified buri-
al, he said. < ‘

“We don’ t say people should use a
pet casket,” Hoegh said. “We just want
to make it available. ”

Still, isn’t this a strange way to ”
make money? ,

“We’ ve helped create a whole new
business in this country that has gener-
ated jobs and tax dollars,” Hoegh said
“That helps everyone.”

MIKE LANNN
Calls plan "the best"

By HAROLD SCARLETT
Post Environment Writer

 

A newly completed plan for
managing the four national forests
in Texas calls for increased timber
production from fewer harvested
acres —— and less clear-cutting.

The US. Forest Service plan,
mandated by Congress, is sup-
posed to map out how the public’s
forests will be handled until about
the year 2000. Similar plans ar

' under way for national forests

across the nation.

The plan, a refinement of a draft
plan put out for comment last July,
includes several changes that could
be viewed as concessions to envi-
ronmental groups. '

' It reduces clear-cutting from 75
percent to 60 percent of the timber
produced, increases from 40 years
to 70 years the age of trees to be

cut, expands the acreage of scenic
areas and increases from 4,134‘
acres to 13,190 acres the forest
land to be thinned annually.

This thinning of trees for better
growth will favor ﬂowering and
nut-producing hardwoods which
would benefit wildlife, the Forest
Service said.

The greatly expanded thinning
will help boost annual output of the
Texas national forests from 103.6
million board feet annually to more
than 126.3 million board feet —
even though harvested acres are to
drop from 7,175 to 6,400.

In other environment-favoring
steps, the final plan calls for map—
ping and management of bogs,
seeps and springs, and a quarter-
mile-wide protective corridor along
the Neches River as a step toward
making it a wild and scenic river.
Both proposals are entirely new

praise,criticism from environmentalists

since the draft plan, the Forest
Service said.

Mike Lannan, the service’s Tex-
as supervisor, said he believes the
plan, which took years of work by
several hundred professionals, will
be “the best for the management
of the public’s land while serving
the needs of all people.”

But at least some environmental
leaders believe the Forest Service’s
plan is still tilted too heavily in fa-
vor of timber production.

Ned Fritz, a Dallas environmen-
tal leader and perennial Forest
Service critic, said the agency is
still committed to clear-cutting and
still ignoring the single-tree selec-

“Clear-cutting is like doing brain

He said some of the goals of the

Forest Service plan are commend—
able, but he claimed that “their
goals just do not fit their actual

made clear, in comments on the
draft management plan, that it '_“is
not crazy about clear-cutting,

TRIBUNE - ‘ '

TAMPA ——- America’s zoos are abandoning
conventional concrete jungles to explore new
—— and costly - ideas in how to keep and dis-
play animals.

A major trend is a move away from boxing
animals in cages. Instead, zoo keepers are cre-
ating more naturalistic environments for the
animals, allowing them —— as much as possible
~—- to live among trees, grasses and shrubs from
their native lands. Computers, highly educated
personnel and breeding of endangered species
also are changing the way America’s zoos oper-
ate.

“It’s a very dynamic field right now. You
Can see vestiges of the old zoo, concrete and
chain-link fence, which is a really antiquated
view of zoos. No new zoos arevbuilding like
that,” said Charles “Lex” Salisbury, the new
200 supervisor at Lowry Park Zoo in Tampa.

A “SkiZoo’-’ outside Minneapolis, for exam-
ple, features six miles of cross-country ski
trails through the 500-acre Minnesota Zoo, al-

 

 

lowing skiers to zoom past Japanese snow mon-

keys, Siberian tigers, moose and other animals
housed in outdoor enclosures replicating their
natural environs.

And the San Diego Zoo, recognized as the
nation’s No. 1 zoo, has tackled one of the larg-
est wild-animal projects ever conCeived. Work— '
ers are totally reconstructing the zoo to create
10 types of bioclimatic zones that will allow
grouping animals from around the world in
habitats ranging from a tropical‘rain forest to a
desert to islands.

Locally, Tampa’s Busch Gardens — recog-
nized as a world-class zoo —- has experimented
with n tural environments for years. The 200’s

And Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo is undergo-
ing a $20 million reconstruction that will in-
clude numerous exotic animal displays and
breeding facilities for endangered species
when finished. The work is being done in two

phases, with the first stage of construction ex-

pected to be completed early next year.
According to professionals in the field,

American zoos are leading the world in zoologi- 1
cal park design, taking into consideration not

only the physical but the s cholo
of-‘animals. p y gical needs

“Zoo keepers "are designing exhibits to dis-
play the animals in as natural 3 setting as pos- 1

sible They feel more at home and, therefore,
their responses are more like they would be in
the Wild,” said Robert Wagner, executive direc-
tor of the American Association of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums in West Virginia.

“When the animal is exhibited in its natural I

environment, we assume it is better off ps cho- *
logically because it can do all the things 13f has .'

evolved to do,” he said. “The com-
mitment now is on conservation and
providing them with a sanctuary.”
As zoos continue to improve, at-
tendance continues to rise, too,
Wagner said. About 112 million peo-
ple visit zoos or related facilities in
the United States and Canada each
year, he said. '
“That’s more than the combined
number of persons attending profes- i
sional sports events in the United
States, which at last count was
about 89 million,” he said.
Working with endangered spe-
cies is one of the more important
trends taking place in American
zoos, Salisbury said. Busch Gardens,
for instance, has the largest cap-
tive-breeding elephant program in
theworld. And about 50 percent of
Lowry Park Zoo’s species will be
part of a Species Survival Program,
which will utilize state-of-the-art
captive-breeding techniques. Some
of the endangered animals, Salisi
bury said, are scheduled to be rein-
troduced back into the wild.
“There’s a whole rethinking tak- "
ing place,” Salisbury said. “The pro. ’
cess has changed dramatically. It’s '1
got real benefits for the animals.” ‘

“In the past,” said Lowry Park
Zoo Superintendent Doug Porter,
“these types of facilities were set up
merely for amusement. Now people
are more enlightened and they ex-
pect more. Now we are trying to
preserve animals that are disap-
pearing in the wild. ”

‘ Zoos traditionally have grouped

' animals by type, putting all the

birds together, the apes and mon-
keys together, all the reptiles to-
gether. That’s called “taxonomic”
exhibition, Porter said.

“We still do that,” Porter ex-
plained, “but the new way is ‘zoo-
graphic,’ where you take a region,
say Asia, and group the animals by
where they are from.”

That’s being done at the San
Diego Zoo, which draws some 3 mil-
lion visitors annually. The ambitious
$100 million, 15-year reconstruction
to create 10 bioclimatic zones is the
largest such project ever attempted,
said zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett.

“At most zoos you have apes
from Africa mixed right in with
monkeys from South America and
that doesn’t give a very realistic im-
pression. That’s not the way things
are in nature” Jouett said. “What
we’ re doing is very expensive. It’s
cost-prohibitive for most of the
smaller zoos. But it’s an attempt to

mix species in a more natural and

meaningful fashion. ,

Zoos also are working together
more than ever before, Porter said.
They are exchanging animals and
sharing zoo personnel and biological
information. Lowry Park Zoo, for
instance, is working with the San
Diego Zoo and New Orleans' Audu-
bon Zoo to obtain animals. ’

“We’ll be working with scientists
and other facilities throughout the
world,” Porter said- “We are
plugged into the International Spe-
cies Inventory System. It’s a com-
puterized inventory of zoo animals
around the world. If we‘have a rare
animal that is sick, we can quickly
find out which zoos haVe that ani-
mal. It’s a very useful tool for us.”

Lowry'Park Zoo also will be the
site of a “ChimpanZoo,” an impres-
sive exhibit that will continue the
studies of world-renowned chimpan-
zee researcher Jane Goodall. The-
52-year-old woman spent 26 years
studying chimpanzees in Africa, and
will work periodically with person-
nel at Lowry Park.

“Creating a zoo is like creating a ‘
piece of art. Until it’s done, you
don’t know what it’s going to lookf
like,” Porter said. “We’re not at all
intimidated by being small and by'
being the new kid on the block. The
word is out that we’re serious, and
we’re here to stay.’

the city’s other shelter in Oak Cliff,
adoptions have “almost entirely

narian for the city animal shelters.

crease in the amount ,of time an ani-

destroyed after 24 hours, and some-

When animals are brought in,
they are screened for adoption. The
prime candidates are moved into a
sort of showroom, where they are
kept sometimes for several months.
A “second string” of dogs and cats is
also kept to replace those adopted.

Judging by the overcrowding
in animal shelters around Dallas,
pet owners are shirking their re-
sponsibilities more than ever.
Shelter workers say record num-
bers of animals have been
dumped on them - particularly
cats.

And unlike in years past, the
shelters report fewer people will-
ing to claim or adopt the
unwanted pets. At the Dallas Soci-
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals shelter on South In-
dustrial Boulevard, workers said
pet adoptions have declined
nearly 50 percent over the last
year. About 400 animals there
were adopted in May 1986, "com-
pared with 200 last month.

At the city’s Forney Road shel-

Animal shelter workers attrib-
ute some of the problems to eco-
nomics —- and ignorance.

With a weaker economy, some
people are unwilling to pay for vac-
cinations and operations to have
their pets neutered. And shelters
galso report an increase in the num-
ber of adult pets being abandoned,

~~ possibly because families can no
longer afford to care for the ani-
mals.

When it comes to animal adop-
tions, pets are not cheap. At the city
shelter, for example, a 4-month old
female kitten costs $52, which in-
cludes administrative fees, city reg-

,- istration, and the cost to have the

animal neutered when it is old

enough for the operation. Adult
cats cost slightly less. Adoption fees

for dogs start at $44 and increase de-

pending on weight and age.
Cats are presenting a particular
problem now. With warm weather,

“the breeding season kicks in.

 




The “free—kittens” signs dotting
lawns during the breeding season
make fewer peeple willing to spend

the extra money to save an animal .-

from the pound during an eco-
nomic crunch, officials said.

“So if we don’t sell the cats at the
shelters, we can’t put any more new
ones into the adoption cages, so we
have to have more destroyed," said
Molly Payne, a veterinary assistant
with the city shelters.

By adopting free kittens from
neighbors and not having the new
pets neutered, people are adding to
what Ms. Ramsier of the Society for
the vaention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals called a “vicious cycle.” The
unneutered kittens grow, and inevi-
tably produce a litter of kittens of

their own during the next breeding .

White said he came to work re-

Zoo ofﬁce, Terminal Annex get new life in new hard times

By Bill Marvel
Staff Writer of The News

Almost 50 years have
passed since government offi-
cials dedicated the new US.
Terminal Annex at Houston
and Commerce, then the most
modern mail-handling facility
in the country, and workers at
the Dallas Zoo put the finish-
ing touches on the handsome
little stone building that
would house the zoo office.

Both buildings were typi-
cal products of the Great De-
pression. The 200 office was
built by the Works Progress
Administration (WPA), one of
those alphabet agencies estab-
lished by President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt to put men
to work and get the country
back on its feet. Although not
a WPA project, the Terminal
Annex was an outgrowth of
the same government effort to

pour billions of dollars into local cené
struction, and its handsome lobby would

soon be decorated with murals produced

under the Federal Arts Project, a part of

WPA. ,.

Now that hard times are with us again,
both of these buildings are being re-
turned to useful life, one as a gift shop and
the other as a government office building

new buildings were con-
structed and 85,000 more were
repaired or restored. It is a tee
timonial to the sturdiness of
these buildings that most of
them remain in use.

. In a way, the Depression
may have been the best thing
ever to happen to American
zoos. Attendance swelled as

ment plowed millions into 200
construction and improve-
ments. At the Dallas Zoo, a
pedestrian bridge at the origi-
nal entrance, cat and monkey
cages and the old 200 office

- date from the WPA era.
The old office building was
a modest structure, and restoration and
conversion into a gift shop has been in
keeping with the scale of the original

; project. Total cost was about $50,000, but '

' the Dallas Zoological Society, which paid

for the project, got a gem of a building for
its money.

’ Built of native Texas “river stone, " a

rustcolored sandstone, the building
had long since become too small for
the zoo office. In recent years the
basement had been used to store
hay, and the upper floor had been
leased out to a vendor who sold no-
velties. .

Three years ago, the Zoological
Society became interested in taking

.. over the map and refurbishing the

building and asked several of its
members to look into the possibili-
ties. Ubby McKee, who took charge
of the project. obtained bids. and
Frank Watch Associates was hired
for the renovation

“We wanted to bring it back as
close as possible to the original,"
says Ron Womack, the architect in
charge. The original plans couldn't
be found -4 nobody remembers the
name of the architect .. and so
Womaclt had to err wi over the build-
ing taking measurtunents to draw up
new plans.

4 Over the years, dozens of coats of
paint had accumulated on the stone
walls, the most recent a hideous op

.erating room green. Some of the
original double-hung windows had
been replaced with single panes of
glass, and others had been painted
shut and were rotting. But under.
neath all this was what Womack
calls “a quality, ‘quality building,"
with foot-thick rock walls and
poured-concrete floors.

To start, the building was re

Educed to a shell. Partitions were
Estripped out, and workers spent a
month and a half water-blasting the
E old paint down to the original stone.

E“lt was the worst mess you ever
5.5aw" says Womack, “but it was

worth it."

The eXposed stone makes a very
handsome interior. Color ranges
from warm cream to tan and orange,
and a section of stone wall has been
left standing in the center of the
shop, dividing the space nicely. The
wall is pierced with a semicircular
window etched with the 200’s logo, a
pair of leaping gazelles. The recessed
ceiling is surfaced with pine boards,
and illumination is provided by
track lighting. All very contempo-

- rary, but in arelaxed sort of way.
7 Outside. the building has been re
turned to the slightly rustic cottage
look popular for WPA projects. Win-
dows are double-hung. Benches
ﬂank the entrance. Rustcolored
awnings have been hung over each“
window; the only departure from
the original design.

As a final -'-- and inspired .-
touch, :00 director Warren lliff lo
cated two WPA-era light fixtures at
Como Park Zoo in St. Paul, Minn.
and had them photographed for
reproduction at a slightly smaller
scale by Dallas metal craftsman
.James CinQuemani. The two
wrought 1ron fixtures featuring sil
.houettes of monkeys, hang on either
'side of the entrance. Womack calls
.them “the jewelry on the building."

MICHEL JUTRAS DOESN’T WIN ANY
TROPHIES FOR CLEANING HIPPO TEETH,
BUT HE DOES GET PLENTY OF PLAQUE

Without fear of contradiction, it can
be said that cleaning a hippopotamus’
teeth is a dirty job, but somebody’s got
to do it. Around the municipal zoo in
Granby, Quebec, the job falls to keep-
er Michel Jutras. Actually Jutras, 33,
who’s worked in the 200’s pachyderm
section for 12 years, rather enjoys
scouring the ivories of Patriarche, also
33. “It’s a kind of game between
them,” says 200 veterinarian Clement

Lanthier. “He and the animal have a
good relationship.” That affinity is evi-
dent to tourists, who have made Pa-
triarche’s brush—ups—which take
place once every two days—one of
the 200’s most popular attractions.
When the hippo opens wide, it’s ob-
vious that more than dental floss will
be needed. Jutras uses an industrial-
size scrub brush but without the bene-
fit of toothpaste. The 200’s mascot and

oldest resident, Patriarche (his name
means patriarch) eats sensibly. With
his diet of hay and grain, supplement—
ed with minerals and vitamins, his
breath isn’t too offensive. But his visits
with Jutras add an extra sparkle to his
smile and—who knows?—may even
contribute to his success with the fe-
male of his species. “Patriarche,”
Lanthier says proudly, “has already
given us nine babies.” El

“Fortunately, Patriarche is accustomed to Michel,” says the 200’s vet. “This could be dangerous with a stranger.”

As the elephant trumpets, Zoo School grads depart with fond memories of feeding mice to the snakes and cow’s blood to the bats.

The gorilla was terrified, the camel
was bored and the goat had an acci-
dent. The screaming pig refused to be
photographed, and no one wanted to
hold thewoodchucks because they
drool. One senior had to keep adjust-
ing her slip, and there was a lot of wig-
gling and scratching all around. Clear-
ly, it was the most unusual graduation
photo session ever held in Cincinnati, if
not the world. But that’s fitting be—
cause the Zoo School—the country’s
only vocational high school based full-
time in a zoo—is an unusual institution.
This year the 11 graduating seniors de—
cided to celebrate their singularity by

ry and animal science with such sub-
jects as 200 philosophy, aquarium
management and exhibit design. Grad-
uates often go on to become zoo-
keepers and veterinarians. “With the

structor Kathryn Lanam, “they get an
intense education that’s actually clos—
er to a college curriculum.”

hawk removed the side'of Benny Sor-
rell’s gym shoe, though according to
Benny, “It was less terrifying than find-
ing the snake somebody put in my
book bag.” Instructor Lanam fell into
the penguin pool and had to be res-
cued. One student accidently let the
ponies loose, and for some reason
they all ended up at the Avondale Post
Office a few blocks away.

Besides the adventure, there’s a
mature outlook to be gained. “The kids
become more sophisticated about the
reality of animals,” says Lanam. “The
conservation of animals becomes the
focus. As they grow, their philosophy
grows, and they learn that animals
aren’tjust fuzzy little creatures to hold.
Well, sometimes they aren’t.” El

{Environmentalists battle timber pian

Forest Service expecting to increase harvest from Missouri site ,

 

‘ By Matt Campbell

KANSAS CITY STAR

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — What
John Karel sees when he looks at
Missouri’s plan for the Mark Twain

 

National Forest is rare woodpeck- .

” ers moving on, black bears lumber-
ing from sight. forever and tree
stumps where dense timber once
stood. _ -'

The US. Forest Service has a
different vision —— recreational and
economic benefits for people and
improved habitats for some wild-
life.

Under the Forest Service’s
long-term management plan, which
is being appealed by the Sierra Club
-— of which Karel is a member — 88
percent of the 1.45 million acres in
the nine Mark Twain distriCts in
southern and central Missouri are
. designated as suitable for timber
harvesting. _

Loggers in 50 years could be tak-
‘ 'ing more than twice as much tim-
ber from the forest each year as the
Forest Service says was harvested
in 1986. .

That is too much emphasis on
cutting down trees and not enough
on protecting the wilderness and its
animals, according to the Sierra
Club.

, “We don’t necessarily argue

they could not increase the cut,”
said Karel, former director of the
, division of Parks and Historic Pres-

ervation for the Missouri Depart-
ment of Natural Resources. “But
we find it difficult to accept that
that much (of an increase) would
not have a significant negative im-
pact on the visual landscape.”
Environmentalists also say the
plan makes no provision for pro-
tecting threatened, endangered or
extremely rare species such as the
red-cockaded woodpecker, the east-
ern cougar and the black bear.
Regional Forest Service officials
based in Milwaukee say wildlife
will be protected.
Environmentalists are prepared
to take their case to the Forest Ser-
vice’s superiors at the US. Depart-
ment of Agriculture.
The arguments and paperwork

began after the Twain plan'was Vre-‘
leased last year.

“It is much more heavily orient-
ed toward commercial timber cut-
ting than we had at first realized,
more so than almost any national-
forest plan in the country,” Karel
said.

The environmentalists are in the
midst of a drawn—out appeal pro-
cess, made longer by the number of
other appeals the Forest Service
must handle.

An average of 54 million board
feet — enough timber to extend
more than 10,000 miles —-.was har-
vested from the Mark Twain forest
each year from 1979 to 1984, the

Wilderness Society says. The Forest
Service says 77.5 million board feet
were harvested in 1986. .

Under the 50-year plan, the bar-
vest could grow in 50 years to 198.6
million board feet a year. .

The Sierra Club says timber har-
vesting in the forest is not even
profitable. The group’s appeal cites
a Wilderness Society study report-
ing that the government gets back
only 59 cents for every dollar it
spends making Mark Twain forest
lands available to loggers.

The Forest Service says it gets
back 81 cents on the dollar and that.
timber harvesting reaps other ben-
efits that outweigh costs.

“Timber sales provide habitat
for many species of wildlife need-
ing vegetation in early successional
stages, including deer and grouse,”
said a report by Floyd Marita, a
Regional Forest Service official.

Marita‘s report, the govern-
ment’s reply to the club’s appeal,
noted that public concerns about
“wilderness creep” were important
in the plan.

Wilderness creep is a term
coined by people who oppose pwil~
derness and wilderness-like re-
serves that allow the least public
access to federal lands. .

Environmentalists say the term
is used to promote interests of the
timber industry. The Marita report.
said the government’s plan struck a
balance between the two views.

THE SUNDAY TIMES - London, England - May 31, 1987

l A FEW days ago the whaling ship
f Soviet Ukraine steamed into the
, Black Sea port of Odessa with its ﬁ-

; nal prize, a minke whale. An
orchestra played as the skipper,
% Vladimir Angelin, recited his own

poem, Farewell to Antarctica. It
‘ was Angelin’s ﬁnal voyage.

Last week’s announcement that
the Soviet Union has at last ended
commercial whaling caused con-
servationists to rejoice for the
Russians had played a leading part
in the plunder, to near extinction,
of “great” whales such as the blue
and right species. But the whale is
far from saved. Japan remains by
far the world’s greatest whaleokiller
and consumer, and is deaf to
conservationist pleas.

At the annual meeting of the
International Whaling Commission
(IWC) in Bournemouth next month
Japanese delegates are expected to
insist on their right to go on
catching 875 whales annually until
the year 2000 for “scientiﬁc”
purposes. The hunt must continue,
they argue,» so that whale stocks can
be monitored. Conservationists,
however, say that research is a
cover to keep the whaling ﬂeet in
work until the time is ripe to
expand whaling once more. The
ﬂesh of whales killed for “research”
ends up in the shops.

In the 19705, after it became clea
that whalers had virtually wipe
out.) the great whales, the “era-
wars-airs” of Greenpeace and other
groups dramatised the plight of the

warm-blooded, intelligent creatures.

that have cruised the world’s oceans
' for 50m years. Progress was
spectacular.

The conservationists produced
ﬁlm of whales, speared by harpoons
with 1601b explosive charges, writh-
ing in blood-darkened seas and
later, in huge factory ships, being

been treated as a renewable
resource. They have been mined.
The excavations have continued
until the quarry became uneco-
nomic.” He describes the Japanese

claim that whales are needed for

research as “humbug” and “a
betrayal of science”.

Holt believes that the number of
whales has been brought so low that
virtually all signiﬁcant species are
in decline. At a recovery rate of 2%
a year, it may take up to a century
for the blue and humpbacked
species to recover.

The message has not been lost on

a world waking up to environ-

mental issues. Growing popular
pressure prompted the IWC, which
was set up after the second world
war to manage world whale stocks,
to impose progressive curbs on

. whaling. In 1982 it ordered a ban
on commercial whaling until 1990. '

Today, with Russia sidelined,
only Japan, Korea, Norway and
Iceland seem determined, in the
cause of “science", to go on

destroying whales. But the Japa- i

nese, by a wide margin, are the
villains. of the piece and are
blocking the way to the real rescue
of the whale.

Japan not only catches whales: it

whalemeat in Japan did not begin.

until the late 19405, when General
Douglas MacArthur, the US mili-
tary chief, commended it as a highe
protein food. ~

The Japanese ﬁshing industry;
{began to exploit the massive whale
{resources of Antarctica and. the
v'Paciﬁc and offered a ready market
I to others. The Russians, as hungry
for hard currency as the Japanese
were for protein, invested heavily

in a ﬂeet of factory ships. Whales
and whaling have since become a
deeply ingrained part of Japanese
commerce and politics. The vested
interests involved are so great that
leaders of Japan’s ruling Liberal
Democratic party are too scared to
disturb them.

The key ﬁgure in the resistance to
curbs on the industry is Zenko
Suzuki, a formidable backstage

‘politician whose power base is in

the ﬁshing industry (to his country-
men he is Mr Fish), and who in the
early 19803 was brieﬂy prime
minister. Suzuki heads his own

part of the huge Japanese ﬁshing
industry, curbs on whale catches are
seen as a threat to ﬁshing interests
as a whole.

Suzuki has led the battle 'to
provide Japanese whalers With
subsidised fuel. He has managed to
keep the price of whalemeat
proﬁtably high (£20 for a steak
weighing about 1202). Above all, he
has remained ultra-sensitive to the
fact that several Liberal-held par-
liamentary seats are in areas where
the population is involved “in
whaling. A candidate in a whaling
area who opposes the slaughter is .
doomed.

Suzuki himself comes from
Honshu, an area where proewhaling
prejudice runs strong. Thus, al-
though the number of Japanese
directly involved in whaling is less ..
than 2,000 out of a total population

 

—of more than 121m (in an economy

with full employment), Japanesel

politicians triﬂe with the issue at»;

their peril.

Alan Thornton, a Greenpeace
director, is convinced that Japan’s
long-term strategy is to maintain
commercial whaling. He believes
that it will keep its ships, crews and
commercial infrastructure intact
until 1990 when the current
commercial ban is reviewed. It will
then ask for the annual “scientiﬁc”
catch to be validated as a
commercial activity. ,

he High Life Suits Downtown Newcomers

By Andre Jackson
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

" There are two ways to reach
the new penthouse high atop the
Edison Brothers Stores distribu-
tion center downtown:

' I After taking an elevator to
the 13th ﬂoor, you walk out onto
the roof and climb a ladder the
last 20 feet through a dark shaft
that leads to the foyer.

I If you’re one of the peregrine
falcons that will occupy the place,
you just spread your wings and
glide through the front door.

_ Two month-old falcons were
placed in their new home Thurs-
day by workers from the Raptor
Rehabilitation and Propagation
Project, which is headquartered

at the Tyson Research Center at
Eureka. Project officials hope to

place the birds, which were bred
. in captivity, into “the wild.” '

Yes, says Maggie Bogart, the
education coordinator for the pro-
ject, high-rise buildings are a
“natural” setting.

“If you look at the buildings
from the bird’s point of view, they
resemble cliffs,” she said. Be-
cause peregrine falcons once
nested along high river bluffs in
Missouri, they feel right at home,
project officials said.

Placing the birds in the heart of

-' the city also reduces the threat

from natural predators such as
owls, said Walter C. Crawford Jr.,

executive director of the project,

which is supported by donations

and volunteer labor.

He noted that man’s intrusions
into the birds’ habitat had driven
them from Missouri by the turn of
the century. Because bird-hunting
humans are relatively rare down-
town, the birds Should be safe,
Crawford said. _

Food sources are plentiful
among the concrete canyons, Bo-
gart said. The other 12 falcons re-
leased downtown since 1985 have
survived on a diet of pigeons sup-
plemented with doves, starlings

— and other birds. The nearby Mis-

sissippi River is also considered a
“major flyway” for birds and a
supermarket of sorts for falcons.
Lest pigeon-haters rejoice,
Crawford said the falcons had no
chance of making a serious dent

I

in the pigeon population.

For two weeks or so, the new
birds will be confined to their
small, gravel-lined cage and will
be checked daily by project work-
ers. Until the falcons develop
their hunting skills, they will dine
on fresh quail dropped through
the top of the small wooden box
they call home.

Bars across the front of the box
will be removed later; the birds
Will then be free to roam or perch
on two tree limbs attached to the
front of the cage.

One peregrine falcon released
in St. Louis has roamed a long
way. At last sight, he had taken up
residence with another bird in
Indianapolis.

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - June 7, 1987

 

 

 

Oil greed overshadows wildlife need ' :

MINNEAPOLIS—Tucked above the Arctic
Circle in northeast Alaska is the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. It is .a stunning landscape that is
home for the breeding populations of some of
North America’s most rare and unique animals.

One summer several years ago, I spent 'an
afternoon watching 35,000 canbou feeding in a
valley in the refuge. I also saw musk oxen, grizzly
bears, tundra swans, golden eagles, peregrine
falcons and tens of thousands of other migratory.
birds with names like phalaropes,.jaegers, plovers,
eiders and tumstones. -

Unfortunately, this remarkable refuge is also the
latest target of the economically strapped oil
industry, even though the chances of a major find
like the one at Prudhoe Bay are less than five
percent. ,

The Reagan administration claims that
Americans should sacrifice this extraordinary part
of our natural heritage for national energy
security. This is an example of the “exhaust
America ﬁrst” policy that is absurd for a number
of reasons. . '

Increasing production will do nothing to
reduce our society’s addiction to foreign oil and
, vulnerability to another embargo. Under the
most optimistic projections, oil and gas
production from the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge will never provide more than four
percent of the nation’s oil needs. Even if
si nifrcant oil is found, it will only dela «the day
OF reckoning for energy shortages by a ew weeks
or months, at the cost of our last remaining

pristine Arctic wilderness. Ironically, the"
Appliance Energy Efﬁciency Act, which
Presrdent Reagan vetoed last year, would have
saved more energy than the Arctic Wildlife
Refuge could ever‘produce. .

The obvious road to energy security would be to

ﬁnish ﬁlling the strategic petroleum reserve, enact

real and straightforward policies to conserve

./ energy, and hold the potential oil and gas in the

refuge for a future time when it might really be
needed for security reasons. The real driving force
behind the push to develop these potential reserves
is proﬁts for the troubled oil industry—not
national security.

Oil development in the high Arctic is risky
business. Spills and ﬁres were commonplace when
nearby Pmdhoe Bay was developed. Now, 10
years after much of the drilling equipment has
been moved, only six percent of the area has been
revegetated. Sensitive Arctic ecosystems can
withstand very little of the pollutants created by
these activities. Yet sponsors of a bill in the US.
House of Representatives would waive all ‘
environmental impact studies normally required
prior to leasing.

The plan to steal this last refuge for Arctic
wildlife from future generations in order to pay for
a few more weeks 0 oil gluttony and provide a
slightly higher profit margin for the big oil
companies is a wanton and irresponsible act. It
should be stopped.

SCIENCE

Grass Replaces Glass
and Trees Uproot Bars

SUMMARY: 11re modern zoo is no longer a compound of cramped cages
where the curious poor at the miserable. Today’s goal is to present
large natural settings with more animals from fewer species, an .
approach that is better for both visitors and occupants. And zoos are in
the vanguard of the battle against extinction, with breeding programs
that include artificial insemination and embryo transfers.

he breeze rustles through the tall

grass on the plain, rufﬂing the

manes of the zebras just waking

from a nap in the warm afternoon sun.

Their ears perk up as a pair of chattering

birds bursts from a bush in the background

and swoops toward the water hole. Off

toward the horizon, a herd of Thomson’s

gazelles bounds exuberantly between huge
rocks, scruffy shrubs and towering trees.

The scene seems typical for the grass-
lands of southern Africa. But it is occurring
half a world away in Arizona, in a four-acre
replication of the African veld at the Phoe-
nix _Zoo. Known as a “landscape immer-
sion” exhibit because it immerses human
visitors in the animals’ natural setting, this
display technique is the most visible of a
number of dramatic advances that are fun-
damentally changing the ways zoos look
and operate. -

As recently as a decade ago, the vast
majority of zoos were little more than ex-
hibit halls, each holding what zookeepers
call “postage stamp collections” of small
numbers of as many different species as
possible. In most cases, the animals were
housed in small, plain, sparsely furnished
glass and metal enclosures in which they
looked more like prisoners than prizes.

But the dizzying rate of extinction
worldwide — 100 species a year now, pre-
dicted to rise to as many as 100 species a
day by the turn of the century — has forced
these institutions to rethink completely
their methods and purposes. The top prior-
ity of zoos worldwide now is wildlife con-
servation. With each passing year, more
zoos embark on research, public education
and conservation programs designed to en-
sure the health and survival of animals in
the wild as well as in their own collections.

“Zoos are now driven by an overall feel-
ing of the importance of conservation, and
research is one tool available to us to make
that happen,” says Warren Iliff, director of
the Dallas Zoo and president of the Amer-
ican Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums. At some point, “we’ll be in a
position to reintroduce animals back into
the wild, and it is critical that we know as
much about those animals as we can.”

Many zoos also are abandoning some of
their cells in favor of larger, more natural
and inﬁnitely more comfortable enclo-
sures. “What has taken place in zoos is the
realization that the public enjoys the ani-
mals more, and that it is more of an edu-
cation, to display the animals in a simulated
natural habitat,” says Wayne Homan, gen-
eral curator of the Phoenix 200. Adds Iliff,
“There is more to having an animal than

NEW YORK ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY

just throwing it into a cage. We’re realizing
more the animals’ social and psychological
needs.”

Many of these immersion exhibits, such
as the Phoenix Zoo’s African veld or the
Bronx Zoo’s $10 million Jungle World
Asian rain forest, are dazzling in their clev-
erness and splendor. They are also ex-
tremely expensive and take up much more
room than standard 200 exhibits to show
fewer species. But despite those disadvan-
tages, their obvious appeal is proving an
invaluable tool for educating the public and
raising funds. So almost every major zoo
in the country has built or is building some
kind of large new immersion exhibit.

To most zoogoers, these exhibits are
most notable for their duplication of natural
habitats, but the key to many of the new
showcases is their focus on food. The ac-
quisition of food plays such a role in the
lives of wild animals that, Iliff says, “the
greatest challenge we face is with feeding
the animals through methods that more
closely resemble the way they have to get
their food in the wild.”

Some methods are fairly simple. At the
Bronx Zoo, an artiﬁcial tree randomly
oozes honey for the bears and another
mechanism dispenses live mealworms for
marsupials known as sugar gliders. At
other zoos, animals are challenged to ﬁnd

food strategically scattered in hard-to-ﬁnd
locations throughout their enclosures.
Others are more ambitious. In a new
exhibit at the Milwaukee County Zoo, the
keepers play recorded seal sounds to polar
bears. If the bears are so inclined, they can
search for the origin of the sounds among
the rocks in their enclosure. And when a
bear pokes his head or paw into speciﬁc
crevasses, it activates an electric eye device
that drops food into the swimming pool.
“The exhibit is designed for underwater
_ viewing, and the food drops right in front
of visitors, so you get a real good look at
it,” says Gilbert K. Boese, the 200’s direc-
tor. The exhibit is designed to show off the

animals’ hunting and foraging skills, but it
is also revealing their intelligence. .

“What has happened is that the male
does the exploring, and the females poise
themselves at the proper places along the
edge of the pool. And as he breaks the
beam, they dive in and get the food,” Boese
says. “They’ve gotten so cunning, they
know now exactly where to go when they
want an extra reward.”

Some critics consider these devices de-
meaning and manipulative and say they
create behavior patterns as abnormal as
those triggered by sheer boredom. But
many 200 scientists believe the machines
help create situations similar to those in the
wild, where an animal must act with its
instincts and intelligence. “I don’t think we
are manipulating the animals any more than
they would be manipulated in the wild,”
Boese says. “We’re compressing it, and

maybe it’s not as diverse, but we’re enrich~
ing the animals’ environment and giving
them another variety of activities.”

The zookeepers also believe the more
natural surroundings should boost their re-
search efforts. “The natural environment
tends to promote natural social behaviors,”
Iliff says. “Zoos are wonderful places to do
long-term observations because there is sta-
bility and accessibility. And the more nat-
ural we can make them, the more authentic
the behavior is.”

To a large degree, the success of these
irnmersion exhibits is tied to the quality and
variety of the animals they contain. And
with the rapidly rising extinction rate and
the increased difﬁculties in obtaining rare
wild animals, the task of collecting animals
is proving harder than ever. That makes
monitoring and improving the captive ani-
mal’ populations ever more important.

That job has become somewhat easier
in recent years, however, through the wide:
spread acceptance of the International Spe-
cies Inventory System, a computerized
catalog of the animals held in 233 zoos
around the world. The system’s six-person
ofﬁce, based at the Minnesota Zoo near

Minneapolis, tracks such vital statistics as
irth, sex, parentage, transfer and death of
more than 70,000 animals.

“Before this program was started in
197 , there was no method at all for keep-
ing track of zoo animals,” says the system’s
director, Nathan R. Flesness.

“In fact, a lot of zoos didn’t keep any
kind of records at all. The keepers knew,
but when they left or died, the information
went with them.”

Member facilities provide genealogical
information for the species inventory data

base. Every six months, the staff sends out

an updated microﬁche report numbering as
many as 10,000 pages as well as a con-
densed paper summary. The reports “pri-
marily give you information about who has
what. If you need to ﬁnd a 5-year-old male
armadillo, it tells you who has those,” Fles-
ness says. “Also, it tells you who’s breeding
what, in case you need expertise. And it
provides information on how well the cap-
tive population is doing through trends like
irths and deaths.”

One of the most recent examples of the
system’s helpfulness occurred last year.
“The Mysore Zoo in India joined ISIS in
1986, and our report noted that it has a
substantial collection of rhinos. The T0-
ronto Zoo was looking for a rhino and saw
that Mysore had several and contacted
them,” Flesness says. “In turn, Mysore ex-
pressed great interest in Cheetahs, which to

47

 




our knowledge have not been held in India.
And a trade was arranged.”

Animal exchanges are perhaps the sys~
tem’s most obvious beneﬁt, but he lists its
primary purpose as establishing a data base
as broad as pos'sible to help zookeepers
develop animal collections “that are demo-
graphically stable and genetically diverse.”
Animal populations lose their genetic di-
versity as their numbers shrink, and exces-
sive inbreeding can result in reduced resis-
tance to disease, increased infertility and
reduced competitiveness.

Equally important is building and main-
taining populations with healthy numbers
of young, middle-aged and older animals.
More and more, this is done through on-site
breeding programs. “We’re forced to breed
because the animals are not available from
the wild anymore,” says Homan. In fact,
Flesness says, “90 percent of the animals
we tracked that were new coming into zoos
in 1986 were captive-bom. So 90 percent
of the stock is conring from zoos.”

ne of the ﬁrst and best success sto-
ries is that of the Arabian oryx.
The graceful, long-homed ante-
lopes thrived for generations on the Ara-
bian peninsula but were hunted to the brink
of extinction in the 19505. At that point,
the conservation community stepped in and
placed a few in a Kenyan game reserve.
The animals did not adapt well to the
reserve’s high altitude and humidity, so
conservationists searched the world for a
zoo skilled in handling captive wildlife and
possessing an environment similar to the
oryx’s own. Phoenix ﬁt the bill, and in
1963 the zoo imported nine wild oryx and
began a breeding program to increase the
population and eventually return some of
the animals to their habitat. The program
worked; since then, more than 160 oryx
have been born in Phoenix and more than
300 of the animals are on display at zoos
around the world. And in 1982, 14 200-
born oryx were released in southern Oman;
under government protection, they are
ﬂourishing in the habitat where their sur-
vival once was threatened.
Recently, a few zoos have begun devel-
oping sophisticated technologies to help
repopulate wild species. In 1981 , scientists
at the New York Zoological Society re-
corded the ﬁrst birth from a surrogate after
they transplanted the embryo of a gaur, a
wild Asian cow, into a domestic Holstein.
'Since then the Louisville, Ky. , zoo has
produced a zebra from a horse and the
London Zoo has produced two zebras and
two Przhevalski’s horse foals from ponies.

One facility at the forefront of this ar-
tiﬁcial reproduction movement is the Cin-
cinnati Zoo, which, also boasts one of the
nation’s most impressive ledgers for captive
natural births of such creatures as gorillas
and white tigers. Since the Cincinnati
Wildlife Research Federation’s program
began in 1981, its scientists have investi-
gated artiﬁcial insemination, frozen em-
bryo transfer and surrogate motherhood.
“This whole concept is something I really
believe in,” says director Betsy Dresser. “I
think it’s the way of the future for zoos. If
we can freeze embryos and identify sur-
rdgate mothers, we can keep species from
going extinct.”

The Cincinnati scientists have achieved
their most notable successes reproducing
different kinds of antelope. “We produced
the ﬁrst exotic animal from an embryo [an
eland], and we’ve succeeded with embryo
transfers between two eland,” she says.
“We’ve also done an interspecies embryo
transfer between a bongo, which is a very
rare antelope, and an eland. And we’ve
transferred embryos from bongo to bongo.”

. Cincinnati also is one of a few zoos
attempting to breed cats artiﬁcially and to
develop domestic cats to receive the em-
bryos of small rare exotics such as Pallas’s
cats and ﬂatheaded cats. Earlier this year,
the zoo became the ﬁrst to produce cats
from frozen embryos, and in April, re-
searchers at the National Zoological Park
in Washington produced three litters of test—
tube kittens. Born from ordinary house
cats, the eight kittens represent the . ﬁrst
time any carnivorous creature, other than
human, has been conceived via test tube.

Though just as compelling, other efforts
are not quite so sophisticated. At the Inte-
rior Department’s Patuxent Wildlife Re-
search Center in Laurel, Md. , scientists use
Cochin bantam chickens to help hatch ea-
gle eggs. The scientists take the eggs from

BILL MENG / NEW YORK ZOOLOG CAL so IETY

female eagles and let the chickens keep
them warm until a few days before they are
due to hatch. Then, the eggs (about the size
of large chicken eggs) are moved to an
incubator. Removing eggs from eagles en-
courages them to lay more.

Not all breeding projects deal with ani-
mals as cute as eland or as majestic as
eagles. The National Zoo is a world leader
in breeding such exotic snakes as emerald
tree boas and such lizards as leopard geckos
and water dragons. “Successful programs
start with deciding very clearly what you’re
going to bre ,” says Dale Marcellini, the
zoo ’s curator of herpetology. “If you’re not
selective, and many places aren’t, you end
up breeding a lot of things you don’t want,
and they don’t get the attention they de-
serve. Only about 10 percent of the species
in our collection is bred purposely in any
kind of systematic way. But we can do it
predictably.”

That consistency is crucial. “Zoos tend
to be ﬁckle,” he says. “They might breed
emerald tree boas for a while, then decide
that’s boring and move on. But then pretty
soon you look up and nobody is breeding
emerald tree boas anymore.”

The nation’s zookeepers hope to correct
that kind of problem, especially when deal-
ing with rare species, through the develop-
ment of Species Survival Plans. Using data
from the International Species Inventory
System, planners from the zoo and aquar-
ium association are drawing up detailed,
coordinated schemes to determine which
animals should be encouraged to mate, as
well as when and how often, in order to
preserve the species, promote genetic di-
versity and maintain healthy populations.

Breeding is but one aspect of the re-
search under way at many of the nation’s
zoos. Most programs are limited to single
ﬁelds, but some wealthier institutions op-
erate broad—based programs that span the
spectrum from applied to biomedical to
behavioral research.

“A lot of the things we do can only be
done in a zoo because most universities just
don’t have the space,” Marcellini says.
“Zoos also have professionals that know
how to keep animals alive. Universities
have to get by the husbandry before they
can start studying them, and frequently,
they get bogged down right there. They
can’t keep their animals in good enough
condition to experiment with them.”

Zoos’ role in education, conservation
and research likely will continue to grow in
importance. “After all,” says Homan, “we
are the ark for future generations.”

1Wolves may be returned
to wilds of Yellowstone

Battle illustrates questions facing national parks

By Patrick Dawson
Special to The News

;YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL
PARK, Wyo. -- Shaggy buffalo bulls
were grazing contentedly through
the lush green grass on the shore of
Yellowstone Lake, oblivious to the
taperecorded howling of wolves
from within the massive log lodge
nearby.

flt’s been more than 50 years ‘
since Yellowstone’s herds of bison

and elk have coexisted with wolves,
but that'old scheme of nature may
be; returning under a plan to rein-
troduce the wolf to the park’s 2.2
million acres of geysers, waterfalls
and pine-forested mountains. '

{The US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice has proposed bringing into
Yellowstone 30 breeding pairs of
gray, or timber wolves, which are
classified as an endangered species
almost everywhere in the United
StaZtes.

éLast weekend, after presenta-'

tions on the wolf that included
slides and recordings, scientists at
the annual meeting of the Greater
Yellowstone Coalition concurred: It
is time for the wolf to return.
%“‘Wolves should never have been

wiped out in Yellowstone, but past _

policies of extermination did not re-
spect park boundaries,” said Joyce
Kelly, president of the Defenders of
Wildlife, who attended the confer-
ence at the Lake Lodge.

gFewer than 1, 300 timber wolves
are left 1n the lower 48 states today;
most are eastern timber wolves con-
fined to the Upper Great Lakes re-
gion.

Canis lupus was hunted, trapped

arid poisoned out of existence in the ,

ROcky Mountains earlier in this
century by ranchers and govern-
ment-paid riﬂemen who wanted to
tame the wild land. Between 1883
arid 1918, bounty hunters killed
81,000 wolves in the northern
Rocky Mountains.

idea of bringing theglwolf 121391910,

Yellowstone; they fear the plan will
add another predator to their costly
battle with coyotes, grizzly bears
arid golden eagles.

LpBut wildlife organizations, gov-
eminent biologists and some policy
makers argue that the wolf is part
of the original balance of nature in
Yéllowstone and should be allowed
toreturn.

:The debate over the wolf is in
some ways a microcosm of the
bifoader questions facing the na-
tion’s 338 parks, national monu-
ments, military battlefields and rec-
reation areas: Should the National

. Park Service emphasize the preser-
va‘tion of the lands or their use? .
3The questions were evident last
week as top parks officials also met
in Yellowstone to plan for the fu-
ture of the park system.

1 According to Park Service Direc-
tor William Penn Mott Jr., one of

the agency’s priorities will be to re

duce the effect of urban crowds on
the park system.

:Mott said that in the future,

more park visitors will be city -

dwellers — people accustomed to

' traffic and noise but unaccustomed
to a less-developed, more natural
setting.

“We ve got to educate the urban
public on how to enjoy and still pro-
tect the units of the National Park
"Service,” Mott said

 

 

 

1 But other 0111c1a1s stressed the
néedito open up the park system for
more users. '

TZ“The parks don’t exist to- be
labked at under glass,” said Assist-
ant Interior Secretary Richard
Horn “They have to serve a broad
range of recreational activities.’

1 In the debate over the wolf, Inte-
ribr Department officials who favor
the pro-use policies of former Secre
tat-y James Watt have been sympa-
thetic to the concerns of ranchers.
Fish and Wildlife Service officials
say the wolf— reintroduction plan
could start at virtually any time, but
final approval of the proposal has
been stalled by Interior Department
officials.

f‘Advocates say the wolf is needed
to help thin out herds of bison and
elk —— 2, 200 and 30,000 head, respec-

‘ tively — that threaten to overgraze

the fragile grasslands.

13: “The wolf is both a predator and
afscavenger,” said David Mech, a
noted research biologist who for

years has studied the 1 ,200-strong

. wplf population in northern Minne- a

sota, the only region where the wolf
it
isnot considered endangered.
iffflt is also a pre-scavenger — it
takes prey a little earlier than they
might die of disease, old age or win-
tar stress,” he said “There are nol
ing deer in a wolf range. The
waives find the deer first, as would .

 

happen in Yellowstone with the elk.
I don’ 1 think wolves are going to be 1
detrimental to a prey population.
They would be an interesting addi-

* tion, and a few wolves can easily re- ‘:
; populate an area.” '

Opinion surveys by conservation

lgroups show strong support for
* reintroduction of the wolf to Yel-

lowstone. And Mott confirmed on

. his visit to Yellowstone that he sup-

1

ports the Fish and Wildlife Service

2 plan for 30 breeding pairs here.

(L.

.But ranchers are skeptical, de--

 

 

 




spite the assurances of people such
as Yellowstone research chief John
Varley that it is unlikely the wolves
Twould leave the park and prey on
livestock.

The Endangered Species Act al-
lows government wildlife agents to
kill listed species if necessary to
protect domestic livestock. The
wolf‘s most aggressive advocate, the
Defenders of Wildlife, is raising
money for a fund to be adminis-
tered by the. government that
would pay ranchers for livestock
losses attributable to marauding
wolves. .

Kelly, the Defendersof Wildlife
president, said she was encouraged
by the support for the wolf from
Mott and the Greater Yellowstone
Coalition. But she remains frus-
trated by the Interior Department’s
inaction on the plan.

“We urge Interior Department
officials to quit delaying this im-
portant step for western wolves,”
she said. “The bowl of the wolf
should again join the roar of the
grizzly and the bugle of the elk in
Yellowstone."

DEAR DALLAS

Tiny condor part -
of big baby boom
in Dallas zoos ,

One-month-old Quechua will never win
any beautiful baby contests. His nose is too
big, his eyes are too small, his neck is
black and wrinkled. Face it, he’s ugly.

But to the Dallas Zoo, this Andean con-
dor is Mr. Universe. He’s
also the ﬁrst of this rare.
and endangered species
to be born at the Dallas

. Zoo.

The largest ﬂying bird
in the world with an
adult wingspan of 10%
feet, the condor comes
from the remote coastal
Andes Mountains of
South America.

Little Quechua, weigh—
ing about 1 pound, isn’t
yet on display ' to the

.public, but his parents are. Too young for
showing off, he spends all his time eating,
sleeping and growing inside the family en-
closure. However, if visitors look close
they might spot other additions, such as a
new Abyssinian ground hornbill and three
young pied crows.

Additional babies have been delivered in
the reptile department, where the Austra-
lian Macquarie turtles have produced nine
new offspring for “The Other Side” exhib-
it. The male Macquarie has a rather bizarre
technique for winning the female’s affec—
tions -- he showers her with water squirt—
ed through his nostrils.

Over in the mammal department, new
primate parents include the spider mon-
keys, gibbons and ruffed lemurs whose
offspring can be seen clinging to their
mothers’ fur. . '

KENNEDY

 

“Quechua,” the ﬁrst Andean condor

chick ever hatched at the Dallas Zoo,

The new Children’s Zoo has baby chicks,
ducklings, cavies, llamas and pettable
sheep and goats. The primate nursery’s
star attractions are three toddler orang-
utans still in diapers. . '

At the International Wildlife Park in
Grand Prairie, Bingo the baby bongo ante—
lope is the latest celebrity birth. The young
female is the second birth in the park’s
four-year bongo breeding program. With
an adult male and a female and now Bin—
go, wildlife ofﬁcials hope Bingo is the be-
ginning of a baby bongo boom.

While there are an estimated 300 bongo
in the United States, the animal has been
placed on the endangered species list in
East Africa, where it is rarely sighted in
the tropical rain forests.

Visitors to the wildlife park also will find
Murphy, a 7-month-old dromedary camel
that stands 6 feet tall; a 3—month-old baby

hippo; a white rhino born in January; and

 

tips the scale at 516 grams (about one
pound) at his first weigh-in.

a 2-month-old Arabian oryx (only about

.300 remain in Saudi Arabia).

The Dallas Aquarium at Fair Park will
put its new 4-foot—long arapaima on dis-
play next week. The arapaima, which re-
sembles a gar, is the largest fish in South
America and grows to about 7 feet. It, too,
is on the endangered species list.

“But the thing everyone will want to see
is our new 32%-pound Maine lobster,” says
biologist Steve Robertson. “He’s incredible
and may be a record, but he won’t be on
display until July, when we get the water
in his tank chemically balanced.”

The lobster was donated to the aquarium
in April by an anonymous restaurant. “He
arrived in the back seat of a Volkswagen,”
Robertson says. “He was extremely emaci-
ated and hadn’t been fed in a long time.
He’s doing ﬁne now and eating us out of
house and home.”

. , “Well,” Avanzino replied, picking-his words
more slowly than a cat picks at his dinner, “a cat
: 18 not a humane hunter. That is a cat’s nature.
{' Perhaps Mother Nature herself would be ineligi-

. ble for membership in the humane society.”

In nearby cages, other cats were ripping at

. stuffed mice, too. A pigeon flew by, took one look
. at the proceedings and kept flapping. Birds like
cats as much as mice, dogs or sensible humans do.

“If one of these adorable cats Were to catch
an unfortunate pigeon, well, there would proba-
bly be a fatality,” Avanzino acknowledged. He
didn’t say which animal it would be but, in Reno,

. you couldn’t lay lOO-to-l for the bird. ‘
EANWHILE, the Cat-o-Rama proceeded ac- '
» cording to plan. The hot sun got to about
‘ three dozen peOple, who actually stepped for-
, ward and adOpted cats. It might also have been

There’s Nothing Cute

Great Snakes, Dragons

Seized in San Jose Reid

By Leslie Guevarra

Federal agents and investi-
gators from Australia broke up
a San Josebased reptile ring
that smuggled in exotic lizards
and snakes to be sold as pets in
this country.

Robert Stene, 26, of San Jose,
was jailed without bail pending a
hearing today on 30 charges that
could result in a lOB-year prison sen-.
tence and $4.2 million in fines.

Stene and co—defendant David
Rittenhouse, 25, also of San Jose,
have been accused of journeying to
Australia and Mexico over the past
two years to trap and ship more
than 100 of the endangered reptiles
to this country. The creatures were
estimated to be worth from $30,000
to $40,000. ,

The live beasts were to be sold

secretly to collectors in this coun- -

.try, where black-market trafficking
in endangered snakes, lizards, birds
and other fauna is a multimillion-
dollar industry, said Assistant US.
Attorney Eric Swenson.

The Australian reptiles includ-
ed spiny-tailed monitor lizards, pine
cone lizards, shingle-back and blue-
tongued skinks, bearded dragons,
assorted turtles and a Git-foot, 20-
pound green-tree python.

Federal investigators also seiz-
ed Gila monsters, beaded lizards,

turtles and tortoises from Mexico
that the group allegedly brought
across the border in the door panels
of a car.

The colorful but scaryJooking
reptiles are protected species in
Australia and Mexico. '

The highly-coveted creatures
fetch prices of $125 to $1,000 apiece
in the United States, wildlife agents
said. ‘

Investigators in the two man
tries began investigating the al-
leged San Jose ring, when a tattered
box that had been postmarked in
Australia arrived in San Francisco
in January 1985.

Worried postal inspectors cal-
led customs and wildlife officials

because “the package was breath-T
ing," said US. Fish and Wildlife

agent Scott Pearson. ,
A nearly 7-foot python in the

box had split the package’s seams.

during the weeklong trip to this
country.

The Australian reptiles were
usually packed in socks or pillow
cases and jammed inside boxes less
than a foot square, investigators
said.

The packages allegedly were‘
mislabeled as clothing or gifts and
addressed under phony names to
friends of Stene and Rittenhouse.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - May 22, 1987

Animal welfare

LISLE—ln response to Dr.
Apatoff’s letter supporting
animal research, many research
labs’ acts of neglect and abuse
are hidden behind the cloak of
science. Much research is
unnecessarily cruel, senselessly
repetitive, scientiﬁcally invalid
and a waste 0f taxpayer money.

Enforcement of federal animal
welfare laws traditionally has
been so poor as to render them
almost meaningless in terms of .
offering animals real protection.

The search for a realistic,
sensible approach that spares
animal lives, without destroying
legitimate and responsible
research, has become a great
national cause. What we ask is
more accountability, an end to
marginally useful research, less
duplication, accelerated
development of alternative
methods that do not require
animals, better veterinary care
and a minimum of suffering.
Many institutions are pursuing
alternatives to animal testing
and we applaud them.

The existence of an informed ,
and knowledgeable public is the
biomedical research
establishment’s greatest fear and
our greatest strength.

, Creating an apeman slave

would be a step backward

I am so shocked and horrified by
the May 14 story, “Apeman can be
created,” that I hardly know where
to begin to tell you how terribly
wrong that would be.

Just because something can be
done does not necessarily mean that
it should be done. Breeding for stu-
pidity is contrary to every aspiration
that mankind has had for centuries.
Creating quasi-humans for slave 1a-
bor would degrade not only the poor
creatures but would also degrade us.

Slavery, be it noted, is as bad for
the slavers as it is for the slaves. In
both cases it destroys dignity and
worth, and pride. Science should ben-
efit humanity, not degrade it.

Breeding for docile, stupid man-
like creatures to slave for us, or to be
used as living sources of organs? No!
Not at any price. Never!

BOSTON GLOBE - May 23, 1987

 

Needed: An intelligent law that protects

 

ALAN [UPC

 

Meet the new mugger. Like the
ones we’re used to, this character
takes you unaware; unlike the one
we’re used to. he doesn’t want
your wallet, just your blood.

Two months ago in Haverhill,
two kids were attacked by pit bull
terriers; one required surgery.

Last month in Dorchester. a pit
.bull jumped an 11-year-old girl
“and gouged and scratched her se-
riously enough to put her in the
hospital. Another pit bull mauled
a dog on a leash. That same
month, in Lynn, which has a his-
tory of pit bull incidents, one in-
vaded a family’s back yard and
killed their pet cat.

. This month, a pit bull terrier

attacked two kids in Dorchester.

In Mattapan, a pit bull attacked a

‘ woman on her way to work: she
'was cut on botharms.

If you like the big picture, I can
assure you this is not a Massachu-
setts phenomenon. In the past 16
months, 16 Americans have been
killed by dogs; 10 of the dogs were
pit bull terriers.

Now, in the interest of fairness
and accuracy in behalf of dogs
who may feel libeled and their lov-
ing owners who are about to take
pen in hand to protest, I must note
that there are various combina-
tions of bull terriers. that some
breeds are gentle and even that
some of the pit bull terriers are
easygoing mutts.

’ Given that the bad ones do not
wear eye patches, scally caps and
shoulder holsters, this situation
causes much confusion for well-
meaning owners. potential vic-
tims, local officials trying to pro-
tect the citizenry, cops and ani-
mal-control officers and, of course,
the poor letter carrier.

When cities and towns try, for

.f

example, to enact laws dealing
with only the breed, they run into
legal problems. In a Lynn court
case, some had trouble describing

just what a pit bull terrier looks

like. Even if everyone can agree on
the definition. says Carter Luke,
director of shelters for the Mass-
achusetts Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, we
have to know, “Is this a dog bred
by families to be a wonderful fam-
ily pet, or was it bred by dog-
fighters to be game and aggres-
sive‘?”

Another problem, says Luke.
“is that'such laws don’t include
the nasty German shepherd living
next door to you.”

The MSPCA intends to intro—
duce legislation next year to deal
with the threat of vicious animals:
the legislation would strengthen

4 existing laws and provide for bet-r

ter enforcement.

 

people from pit bulls

H

I?!

‘ in.

Of course, if citizens paid at-
tention to leash laws, we wouldn’t
have so many problems. But even
that would not stop a dog from
suddenly turning on the kids in
the house. Pit bull terriers have
been known to do that. They at-
tack without warning, seemingly
without provocation. For this
state of affairs. we have two
groups of people to thank.

The first group is the bird-
.brains who decided in the early
18005 that letting bulldogs attack
a stationary bull was great sport.
This took place in that bastion of
advanced civilization, Great Brit-
ain. When this was declared il-
legal. the sportsmen got into the
business of dogfighting; they bred
terriers with the bulldogs, placed
the results of those marriages in
pits and laid heavy money on the
action.

The second group includes

 

those who breed pit bulls to fight,
maim and kill and those who
think it’s macho to own such an
animal. Among those who think
it’s macho are those who make a
living dealing drugs and who see
the pit bull terrier as another
automatic weapon in their arse-
nal.

SO the problem, you see, is not
the dog so much as the person
who owns it. Luke has some ad—
vice for well-meaning owners.
"Meet the parents of the dog and
find out their history," he says.
“Are the parents friendly family
dogs? Hey, here’s mom; she’s
friendly, but where’s dad? ‘Oh.
he’s not so good with strangers.
He’s chained up to the ’57 Chevy.’
Then you've got problems. I per-
sonally would not get a pit bull,
and I would not advise anyone to
get one.” .

What does the potential victim

do until intelligent laws are
passed and fully enforced?

“If a dog is not on a leash,“
Luke says, “notify the animal;
control officer. Also, have an ele
mentary understanding of dog be
havior. Don’t ever run away; that

' will trigger the predator-prey re,-

sponse. Avoid staring the dog di.~
rectly in the eyes. Talk to the dog
in a normal voice. If with a child,
put the child in your arms and
move slowly away in a Sideward
fashion. And report all dog bites};
But, he reminds us, pit bull ter- '
riers do not necessarily behave the
way most threatening dogs do be?
fore they attack. SO, what do you
do if you’re walking along, mind~
ing your own business and you
see a bunch of young guys hang:
ing around with a pit bull?
“Cross the street.”

to get money from officer who shot cat

 

By LARRY KELLER
Staff Writer

1 , Three-and-a-half years after a Pompano
Beach police officer shot her cat to death
f with a pellet gun because he was bored,
' Carrie Belle Wright will receive $4,000
, from the officer in an out-of—court settle-
' ment, according to her attorney.
. Wright sued the city of Pompano Beach
and Police Officers John Hawkins and Ar-
thur Peterson after her white cat was shot
iwithout provocation in the early hours of
”Nov. 2, 1983. She alleged that officers also
{wounded her dog with the pellet gun, “then
: took pleasure from and laughed at the suf-

fering cat during its dying moments.”

Wright, who is in her 708, will collect the
award from Hawkins, according to her at-
torney, Johnny L. McCray.

Peterson resigned from the Pompano
Beach Police Department in August 1984
and could not be located, McCray said.

Hawkins could not be reached for com-
ment on Friday. He has been with the
Pompano Beach Police Department for
61/: years.

McCray said he dropped the city of
Pompano Beach as a defendant because
there was no indication it was negligent in
hiring Hawkins.

The incident occurred between 2 and 3

am. when Hawkins and Peterson were on
patrol. In a statement he gave to his superi-
ors two weeks later, Hawkins said he and
his partner spotted a pack of dogs around
the 900 block of Hammondville Road.

“I stated . . . I wished I had a pellet gun
or a B—B gun, I’d fix those dogs,” Hawkins,
now 30, told police.

Peterson said he had a pellet gun in his
car, so the officers got it and drove back to

the area where they saw the dogs. Hawkins.

said he fired one shot at the dogs, then saw
a cat eating near the Melody Bar and shot
it. ; y g
The cat “curled up into a ball,” said

Hawkins, and had a bloody wound over one
eyebrow. The officer said he then shot the
cat again “to put him out of his misery.”

Hawkins, who expressed remorse over
the shootings,,said, “Things were slow that
night” and “I did it . . just to do some-
thing.”

Soon after, Hawkins and Peterson were .
suspended from the Police Department for '
30 days and ordered by his superiors to per-
form 120 hours of community service
working with animals.

Wright had no comment on Friday, other
than to say she was satisfied with the set-
tlement.

F eIme warns family of fire

By CORKY SIEMASZKO
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA -— By her own admission, Brenda
Rodgers can sleep through just about anything.
Alarm clocks don’t faze her; she is oblivious to
her noisy neighbors; and the traffic outside her
condominium doesn’t intrude on her dreams.

But when her “four-legged smoke alarm”
started wailing Saturday night, Rodgers awoke
in time to carry out her 2-year-old daughter.

‘ Rodgers said she was asleep with her
daughter, Kimberly, when she was awakened
by the cries of her cat, Dennis the Menace.

“I was asleep and all I knew was that my
cat was annoying the hell out of me so I Woke

u,p ” she said.

When she opened her eyes she saw the cat
on her chest, felt the smoke stinging her nos-
trils, and then heard the electric smoke alarm
that was being drowned out by the cat.

“I couldn’t believe it,” she said. “The whole

 

condo was filled with smoke and the cat was

screaming at me to wake up. ”

Rodgers and her daughter fled their River
Oaks condominium, 4825 Puritan Circle, before
firefighters were called.

Capt. John Weinsheimer said the smoke re-
ported at 11.03 p. m. was caused by a pot of
food that had been left cooking on the stove.
He said that if it was the cat that woke Rod-
gers, he probably saved their lives.

“Most fire deaths are caused when people
are overcome by smoke, ” he said.

Rodgers is convinced her 5-year-old part-
Siamese cat saved her daughter’s and her oWn
life.

“He’s orange and white and really pretty
weird- ~looking,” she said. “But I’m so grateful to
that cat. .’He 3 a real hero. ”

Rodgers said she has a fitting reward for
her newest hero. “He’s getting shrimp for a

, week, ” she said.

- Pair face trial for involuntary manslaughter

By Rob Medic
STAFF WRITER

The owners of two pit bull dogs that fatally
mauled a retired Kettering doctor on April 6
were indicted Tuesday on charges of involun-
tary manslaughter.

Joetta Darmstadter, 32, and Wilbur Rut-
ledge, 34, were indicted by a Montgomery
County grand jury. County Prosecutor Lee
Falke said the charge carries a penalty of two
to 10 years in prison. . '

Dr. William G. Eckman, 67, was attacked
in Dayton in front of 256 Marathon Ave,
where Darmstadter and Rutledge lived.

Falke said the indictments are based on the
contentions that Eckman died as a result of
the commission of a misdemeanor -- in this

case, the 'violation of Dayton’s vicious dog
ordinance.
Involuntary manslaughter charges can be

. returned under Ohio law, because involun-

tary manslaughter is defined as causing the
death of another as a result of committing a
misdemeanor, according to the prosecutor’s
office.

Falke said his staff believes there is suffi-
cient evidence to prove that the two owners
knew they had vicious dogs in their home.

Falke said the city’s vicious dog ordinance
has been upheld by the Ohio 2nd District
Court of Appeals and experts who have stud-
ied the two dogs, whichare being held at the
Montgomery County Animal Shelter, will be
able to prove the dogs were vicious.

“That’s one of the things the prose-

defense in the case would include raising the
point that the victim should have survived the
attack. '

“I don’t believe this guy should have died,”
O’Brien said. “It was a breakdown of all of
the social services.”

O’Brien indicated that the response of po-
lice and fire officials at the scene was
inadequate.

“Don’t look for a plea of guilty, I can assure
you.” he added. ,

O’Brien declined to say whether he would
challenge the constitutionality of the city’s
ordinance.

Out West, shepherds sh
In New England, wild-anima

OR MANY YEARS I HAVE RECEIVED A
magazine called National Wool
Grower, the voice of the shepherd-
ing trade. Since most of my sheep-
biz brethren are Westerners, the

magazine, published in Salt Lake City,
tends to reﬂect their rather specialized con-
cerns as well as a unique political agenda—
which is often not my agenda. One of this
joumal’s long-running themes has been
that predators—coyotes, mainly—are kill-
ing up to one lamb in five on the open range
and driving wool growers out of business.
And, according to National Wool Grower,
although the coyote population is explod-
ing, the real problem is the effete, know-
nothing, coyote-loving urban environmen-
talist who has romanticized these predators
and lobbied to restrict the use of various le-
thal measures by which they might be con-
trolled.

 

COYOTEl

By Don Mitchell

National Wool Grower is the only forum '

I’m aware of in which environmentalist is
used like a four-letter word. And since I
think of myself as an environmentalist, it
amuses me to see this magazine on my cof-
fee table next to, say, Audubon. One need
not be in love with coyotes, I used to tell
myself, to accept the role of predation in a
stable, balanced ecosystem. Surely with
such measures as appropriate fencing,
Sheepdogs, and alert, careful shephermng,
predation losses in Wyoming ought to be as
manageable as they are on my farm, in Ver-
mont—which is to say, there should be no
losses whatsoever.

That was my attitude until early last sum-
mer. Looking back, it strikes me as cosmi—
cally nai've. The trouble started one warm,
carefree night in June as my wife and l were
enjoying a party on a deck perched over

oot them, poison them, and curse them.
I lovers are beginning to see why.

farm. Arriving home around midnight, 1
was startled to see my 300 ewes and lambs
bunched up on the gravel driveway. They
had torn through two electric fences to get
away from where I had left them grazing.
Their State of mind was abstracted, as if
they were in shock, so it was easy to herd
them back into the barnyard. There wasn’t
much more I could do for them in the dark.
At the crack of dawn, I took a walk.

N THE ABSTRACT, PREDATION IS A CUR-

iously unaffecting concept, a simple

matter of one animal dining out on an-

other. In the' real world of sheep and

coyotes, however, these are seldom
neat and tidy meals. What happens is that
the predator bites at the throat of the near-
est lamb, and shakes the animal around un-
til it dies of suffocation orblo'od 1655. Some-
times it manages to escape with a ragged
tracheotomy. The lambs that do get away—
and 1 found three of them that morning—
can stagger around for a day or two, bleat-
ing for their moms and enduring who can
say what pain before eventually expiring. As
for the lamb killed outright (only one, typi-
cally, in any given coyote strike), it is
opened at the gut and various high-protein
internal organs are consumed. And that’s it.
A coyote’s taste in lamb, unlike a dog’s,
tends toward liver, not loin chops. Kidney
fat, not crown roast. Most of the red meat
goes to waste or to the turkey vultures that
start ﬂying in a day or so later.

I also found an older ewe, lying on a hill
in the classic stargazing position. Not a
mark on her. I think she died of fright.

I shared my unhappiness over this loss—
four lambsl—with my handsome Great
Pyrenees dog, whose job is to guard my
sheep. “Where were you?” I asked her
sharply, and she answered with a sheepish
look. Sleeping, I supposed. She paced
around and around a carcass, snifﬁng and
taking pains to leave her scent, and I could
see that she felt just terrible about the situa—
tion. But I was grazing the ﬂock on a large
pasture— 1 5 acres, nearly—and sometimes
the dog could be a quarter of a mile away
from her charges. Napping. What I didn’t
know then was that a coyote can penetrate
a fence, do its surgical business, and be
gone inside 10 minutes. And be quiet about
it, too. That’s eating on the run.

The next coyote strike came barely a

 

 

 




week later. I had reduced the pasture's size
, considerably. That was inconvenient, but it
' seemed a wise precaution. But the kill took
place within 80 yards of my house, and I
never heard a sound.

The third strike came a few days later, in
broad daylight. I don’t know exactly
when—l was on my tractor, haying—but it
had to be in daylight because I was now tak-
ing extraordinary pains to pen the flock up
every night, limiting their grazing time so
severely that I feared it would depress lacta-
tion. The concept of growing lambs on pas-
ture—having sheep turn grass into milk

and milk into meat—is an elegant triumph ,

of human ingenuity. But if the sheep can’t

graze freely because the pastures are not .

safe, the system falls apart. And if it turns
out that the lambs are being grown only to
give coyotes a little something to snack on,
the shepherd is apt to ﬁnd himself in need
of a psychiatrist.

T IS DIFFICULT TO CHARACTERIZE THE

sense of helplessness and despair that

repeated coyote attacks foster in a

shepherd. A very weak analogy is ﬁnd-

ing that raccoons have beaten you to
the snow peas in your garden. But cultivat-
ing vegetables does not require a person to
spend many sleepless nights managing ob-
stetric care, nurturing maternal bonds, and
patiently getting each tiny, fragile living
thing off to an auspicious start. And vegeta-
bles do not require daily, dedicated care;
they do not bleat in love or in fear; they do
not leap and gambol and dance across an
emerald field. The sheer economic loss was
staggering, too. Each lost lamb represented
70-odd dollars in gross farm income that
would not be realized. Expenses, though,
would stay about the same. In short, I was
in danger of being eaten alive.

At some point in the midst of my growing
depression, I had an interesting visit with a
neighbor dairyman. “You been having
coyote trouble?” he asked.

“Something terrible.”

“They’re all around here this year. Killed
a newborn heifer calf, last week—and
that’s money.”

“Where’d they come from?” I asked.

“Been moving into Vermont since the six-
ties, folks say. Nobody paid them no never-
mind, at ﬁrst. Now they make you sit right
up and notice. Ever seen one?”

“No."

“Wild eyes, I’ll tell you! You hear them
singing at night?”

“Sometimes—in the distance. Sounds
like the end of civilization.”

He nodded soberly. “You come across
that fellow from the university?”

“What fellow?”

“That research guy. Drives a blue pickup
truck. He’s been coming down this road
once or twice a day lately.” .

“Doing what?” i

“Don't you know?" The farmer shook his
head in disbelief. “This guy traps coyotes,

 

then he puts special collars on them. Radio
collars. That can transmit. Then he turns
the coyotes loose again. He puts on these
headphones and he holds up this antenna,
and the coyotes tell him where they are.
How do you like that?”

“You mean these coyotes are out broad-
casting? While they eat my lambs?”

“Fellow says he ﬁgures there’s 3,000
coyotes in Vermont now. He’s got 30 of
them he can tune in on anytime.”

“This researcher has managed to trap 30
coyotes?” .

“I’ll say this: he’s some kind of a trapper.

If I trapped a coyote, thOugh, I don’t believe ‘

I’d turn it loose. You know what he said to
me? He said to please give him back his col-
lar if I shoot one. Think of this: each one of
those collars costs 400 bucks.”

T WASN’T MANY MORE DAYS BEFORE I
came across the blue pickup, parked
within a stone’s throw of my driveway
on a Sunday morning. “Say,” I told the
friendly man in headphones, “I’ve

heard about you.”

“This your sheep farm?” he asked, posi-
tioning his antenna.

“Yes. And I’ve got coyote trouble.”

“You’re telling me,” he said. “You want to
hear Mortieia?”

“Hear who?”

“Mortieia. I always liked ‘The Addams
Family’—you remember that show? Been a
good source of names for coyotes.” He
handed me the headphones, and I listened
to an electronic click broadcasting on an as-
signed frequency from the coyote’s collar.

“I’ve got a load of buckshot waiting for
Mortieia,” I told him frankly.

He was not surprised. “Maybe you want
Fester, though.”

“Fester?”

- “Mortieia’s mate.”

“I’ll take either one,” I said.

“You’ll need a piece of luck—these are
two successful coyotes. Even if you shot
them both, though, it wouldn’t make too
much difference.”

“Why is that?”

“Another pair would move right in to
claim the territory. Seems to run 10 square
miles per family, give or take. This county’s
all staked out, from their point of view. You

create a vacancy, it won’t take them long to
ﬁll it.”

He noted Mortieia’s compass bearing on
a pad, then climbed into the truck to drive
ahead and get a reading from another point.
It was like plotting a forest ﬁre: he would
ﬁnd Morticia where the two lines intersect-
ed. He would jot down her position and ﬁle
it for future reference, building up a com-
posite picture of her territory.

“Let me get this right,” I said. “You’re
telling me there’s not much hope.” .

“I’m telling you the coyotes seem to be
here to stay. They like it here. They’re doing '
well. Farmers who can’t keep their livestock
safe are going to lose them.” ’

WENT HOME AND PERUSED OLD COPIES
of National Wool Grower with re-
newed interest. There were references
to sharpshooters who could work out
of light airplanes; there were long art1-
cles about ﬁtting lambs with collars that re-
lease a toxic compound when a coyote makes
its characteristic throat-kill; there were ads
for vials of expensive coyote urine, which
might help in luring them into traps. With
enough time, money, and detennmation, one
could probably kill a coyote. But it all seemed
curiously irrelevant given the researcher s
vision of an endless supply of coyotes eager

_ to call my attractive valley home.

After the next coyote strike, I gave up on

' pasture-based lamb production. I weaned
i all the lambs and set out to feed them 1n the
._ safety of the bam—a poor economic ch01ce
when one has lush pastures and milky ewes,

 

5 By autumn everybody in my
neck of the woods had a
a gruesome coyote story to tell.

 

but the only choice when lambs are being
ﬂ gobbled up like potato chips. Several lambs

proved neither old enough nor large enough
i to tolerate weaning, though; they died
’ promptly of malnutrition. Three ewes, too,
“ developed mastitis from havmg had their
' lambs removed on short notice. But at least

predation losses ceased. .

By autumn everybody in my neck of the
woods had a gruesome coyote story to tell,
and tempers were running high. Then deer
hunters—and, later, snowmobilers—stum-
bled onto various dens and made a point of

‘ executing the inhabitants. Nights have been

quiet lately, but the start of a new grazing ‘
season has most farmers apprehensrve. lf

‘ the wildlife biologists are right, any relief

from coyotes will be short-lived.

For my part, I have sunk a pile of money _
into a new system of portable electric
fences, and I plan to move my grazmg
charges to a new half-acre paddock every
summer morning. That will be a daily 90-
minute chore. The new fence, with its high-
tech charger, carries 6,000 volts—which
should make most critters think twice. And
my hunch is that even a lazy cream puff of a
guard dog like mine ought to be able to de-
fend a mere half acre of turf.

Whether this scheme will actually stop
the coyotes remains to be seen. And I don’t
want to get too optimistic; I’ve been wrong
before. When I pick up National Wool
Grower these days, the enraged stones
strike a sympathetic chord. Why, indeed,
should sane human beings knock them-
selves out to feed gourmet fare to wily
coyotes? No wonder the number of sheep
in the United States drops routinely year
after year. Shepherds quit, demoralized and
beaten. 1 might do the same. My advice to
urban coyote-lovers who like fresh lamb:
Eat it while you can. D

Rhesus monkeys could be m0 (161

By Charles Seabrook

Science/ Medicine Writer

WASHINGTON -— Monkeys infected with an _

AIDS-like virus have developed a fatal immune
deficiency, the first time such conditions have

been induced in any animal other than humans. .

Researchers at Emory 'fg'.
University’s Yerkes Pri-
mate Research Center
and, the national Centers

'. fort-Disease Control say
the rhesus and pigstailed
macaques that now have
the experimentally in-
duced disease could be
the long—sought animal
model needed to test
AIDS vaccines and drug
treatments.

“The rapid develop-
ment of disease in these animals may be espe-
cially valuable for quickly assessing the effec-
tiveness of vaccines and antiviral drugs,” Dr.
Harold McClure, the Yerkes scientist who heads
the research team, said Thursday.

Chimpanzees, the only other animals known
to develop a human AIDS virus infection, are
used in AIDS research, but unlike humans, they
do not develop outward symptoms of disease.

Chimps are also an endangered species, ex-
pensive and difficult to work with.

In a report scheduled for presentation Fri-

McClur

day at the Third International Conference on
AIDS, the researchers say the new syndrome in
monkeys apparently is caused by a simian im-
munodeficiency virus (SIV), first isolated from
sooty mangabey monkeys at Yerkes two years

ago. .

Although SIV closely resembles the AIDS vi-
rus, the sooty mangabeys, which are native to
Africa,,appear to be naturally infected with the
virus and seem to suffer no ill effects from it.

But when researchers injected the SIV virus

into three rhesus and pig-tailed monkeys, neither - 1' I

of which are native to Africa, the animals de-
veloped an AIDS-like disease and died within 14
months.

The most dramatic development of the dis-
ease occurred in a pig-tailed macaque, which
suffered multiple AIDS-like abnormalities, in-
cluding severe diarrhea, weight loss and brain

lesions comparable to AIDS dementia in hu-_,

mans.

When the researchers injected blood and oth-
er body fluids from the infected monkey into
other rhesus and pig-tailed monkeys, they devel-
Oped a similar AIDS-like illness that killed them
within days. -

Three sooty mangabeys injected with the
same fluids also developed the disease and
quickly died. _

“This was surprising to me,” said McClure,
who added sooty mangabeys had been thought to
have a natural protective mechanism against

the virus.

“Apparently, this virus changed in some way
from the time we first started working with it,
and it became more virulent,” the researcher
said.

Other researchers attending the AIDS con-
ference here this week say SIV might be identi-
cal to a new AIDS-like virus in humans that was
recently discovered in West Africa.

Letters:

Polar Bear ;
Attack in NY.

My reaction was horror when I
first read the report (Times, May
20) of the tragic polar bear attack
at the Prospect Park Zoo in Brook-
lyn.'But, as the day went on and I
heard the news reported by the
electronic media my horror was
surpassed by outrage. . '

My outrage is at the media.

which took great pains to make

sure we heard all the gory details,
especially how the killer bears
werekilled with 20 blasts from two
shotguns and emptying, a .38 cali-
ber revolver into them. After
which they were cut open to see if
there were bodies inside.
Sensational reporting only
heightens the bloodthirsty violence
and revenge people seem to seek
against, not only animals, but each
other. If we want to bring wild
animals into a captive situation.

which I believe can have great

value for education and behavioral
research, we must be ready to
handle them humanely and re-
sponsibly. We must stop punishing
animals for doing the very thing we
want them to do—be wild animals.
The media do irreparable dam-
age to the conservation'of wildlife
when they portray these animals as
bloodthirsty killers exhibiting what

was, for them, a totally natural"
response when their territory was *

invaded.

We must teach our children to
have respect for animals, for the
powerful, incredible creatures they
are. But, we all must face the truth

that there is only one animal on .
earth that kills for sport and that is .

I would recommend that the
New York Police Department re- .
view its shooting policy. A bear
behind cages and bars is certainly
not life-threatening provided he is
not encroached upon. Shooting
bears with lZ-gauge shotgun blasts
is cruel and inhumane. Besides,
what was the rush? The bears
weren’t permitted to leave “the

scene of the crime."

I was more interested in the
story (one paragraph) of the little

ALONG THE MEXICAN BOR-
DER —— The white-and-black
rooster’s beautiful plumes had
turned blood red and its legs be—
gan to falter four minutes into the
fight.

Its opponent attacked again
with its spurs (sharp blades at-
tached to the rooster’s legs) and it
was all over. The victorious fight-
ing cock, with a spur in the
wounded rooster’s neck, looked
down on the loser, pecked out its
left eyeball and was declared the
winner.

Cockfighting —— an illegal activ—
ity praised by its proponents as an
American tradition and con-
demned by humane groups as bar-
baric — is going strong in the
Lone Star State.

Organizations such as the Hu-
mane Society of the United States
say Texas needs tougher laws to
discourage the activity. They per—
suaded some Texas lawmakers
this session to sponsor tougher
legislation against animal cruelty,
currently a misdemeanor.

House Bill 151, sponsored by
Rep. Charles Finnell, D—Holliday,
would make a person’s third and
subsequent convictions for animal
cruelty a felony, punishable by a
maximum 10 years in prison and
$5,000 fine. The bill has passed
the Texas House and Senate and is
awaiting the signature of Gov. Bill
Clements.

A stronger Senate bill does not
appear destined for passage this
session, which ends Monday. It
would have made it illegal to be a
spectator at a cockfight. It also
would have allowed lawmen raid-
ing cockfights to seize animals,
fighting equipment and vehicles
used to transport the roosters.

Bill Meade of Corpus Christi, re-
gional director of the Humane So—
ciety of the United States, said the
group will work to pass the stron-
ger proposal in a special session or
during the next legislative session.

“Cockfighting is a violent blood
sport that appeals to the very
worst instincts of man —— the de—
sire to be entertained by watching
animals rip each other apart and

‘

fight until the death,” Meade said.

Bernard Weller, field investiga-
tor for the national society, esti-
mated that cockfights are held at
25 locations each weekend
throughout Texas.

It was at such a cockfight near
the banks of the Rio Grande re-
cently that more than 20 matches
were held in a tin-roofed, make—
shift arena with more than 200
people in attendance.

An eroded dirt trail through
mesquite brush and cactus led to
the open-sided brziiding. A young

man sitting in a car parked on the
side of a hill near the arena collect-
ed the $l-a-person admission.

Beneath shady trees surround-
ing the arena, game fowl owners
proudly displayed their favorite
roosters in portable wire cages
while other animals they brought
for the competition remained in
small wooden boxes until it was
time to fight.

Game fowl trade magazines ad-
vertise fighting roosters for $200
to $600 apiece.

The larger of two fighting pits
was about 16 feet wide by 24 feet
long. It had two-foot-high ply-
wood walls.

Some in the crowd appeared to

be Mexican peasants wearing
worn leather thongs or tennis
shoes and loose-fitting shirts and
trousers.

Then there were men in highly
polished leather boots, Westem-
tailored clothing and Stetson hats.
They included farmers, business-
men and a well-known area law-
yer. One elegantly dressed man
proudly displayed a large gold im-
age of a fighting rooster dangling
from a chain around his neck.

The first roosters to do battle
wore inch-long spurs resembling
sharp thorns. The weapons were
snugly glued and taped over the
stub of their broken natural spurs.

Inside the blood-spattered pit,
the handlers set their roosters on
the ground and nudged them to
walk sideways in a circle so pro-
spective gamblers could see how
high they stepped and assess their
spirit.

Spectators who wanted to gam-
ble shouted across the pit, offering
even odds to anyone willing to put
money down in the first contest
between the white—and—black
rooster and its red—and-black op~
ponent. Most bets were for $5 to
$10 but some went as high as $50.

, Private bets among rooster own- ,_

ers were said to be higher
th The referee marked off lines on
the ground, stepped back and told
e handlers to release their roost-
ers. The creatures charged at one
another, clawmg high into the air
each trying to inject its deadly
ts)purs into the other. Their sharp
eaks became filled with feath

as they violently pecked at one
another in their fight for survival.

The men in the crowd cheered
on their favorite and cursed its op-
ponent as the birds’ spurs became
entangled in each other’s bodies.
The referee allowed a 10-second
break for handlers to free the birds
and set them on the ground to
square off again.

Both roosters suffered serious
injuries but the white—and-black
one lost the contest once its eye
was plucked out.

The handler of the white-and-
black carried it off to a comer, ex-
amined it closely, determined it
could not be saved, then cut its leg

1 straps to remove the artificial

spurs.

He handed the bleeding rooster

to a young man who took it
around the side of the building.
put it out of its misery and tossed
it into a nearby pile of weeds.
' The roosters in the next fight
and many that followed wore two—
inch-long steel spurs attached to
their ankles.

One fight followed another in
the arena until about sundown.

Robert L. Leach of Flint, presi-
dent of the Texas Chapter of the
United Gamefowl Breeders Asso-
ciation, said he does not attend
illegal rooster fights but sees noth-
ing wrong with the sport.

“If you believe in Creation, the
Good Lord created them to carry
spurs on their legs to defend them-
selves,” he said. “It is a true dis-
play of nature in its purest form
when these two animals fight for
supremacy, guaranteeing that the
fittest of the species will be the
ones to do the reproduction.

“A flock of these birds is a poor
man’s stable of racehorses. Not ev-
erybody is wealthy enough to have

afford roosters.”

BARROW,_ALASKA SUN - May 28, 1987

Whales Past
St. Lawrence

The annual spring migration of
bowhead whales seems past St. Lawrence
Island now, with strikes the past two
weeks being northward.

On May 15, the crew of whaling
captain Rossman Peetook struck a 2‘7
foot bowhead at 3:05 pm, the third whale
successfully harvested by Wainwright
and the end of a perfect season for the
village.

Joash Tukle and his crew struck a 55'
1" whale on May, 17, but it sank before
it could be landed. Fortunately, the
whale was recovered the next day, and
Barrow whalers were able to salvage the
muktuk from it. The bowhead was
- Barrow's fourth.-

Pt. Hope whaling captain Andrew
Tooyak and his crew stuck a 25'6"
bowhead on May 21 with a perfect shot
at 9:15 am. The whale was Pt. Hope's
third.

Thus far during this spring whaling
season, crews led by the following
Whaling Captains have successfully
harvested bowhead whales: Ray Seetook
of Wales; Ben Ahmaogak, Fred
Ahmaogak and Rossman Peetook of
Wainwright; Clarence Waghiyi of
Savoonga; Amos Lane, Henry
Nashookpuk, and Andrew Tooyak of Pt.
Hope; Oscar Kolnig of Kivalena;
Leonard Apangalook and Ralph Apatiki
of Gambell; George Ahmaogak Sr.,
Arnold Brower Sr., Luther Leavitt, and
. Joash Tukle of Barrow.

As the migration has moved
northward, Savoonga has transferred one
of its remaining two whales to Barrow;
and Kivalena has transferred its
remaining whale to Pt. Hope. Gambell
and Wales have each retained their one
remaining whale. '

The cool temperatures have kept the
lead conditions good off Barrow,
according to Ron Nalikak, administrative
director of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling
Commission. Several Barrow crews
remain on the alert.

At the Commission, preparations are
well underway for the upcoming
International Whaling Commission
meetings in England.

Representatives will leave Barrow on
June 11 for pre-conference strategic

meetings in Anchorage. On June 13 the .

group will ﬂy. to London for a week of

attending working group meetings on
humane killing, socioeconomics, ﬁnance
and administration, aboriginal subsis-
tence whaling, comprehensive assess-
ment of stocks,. infractions and the
format of statistics.

The IWC's plenary session will be
June 22-26. "That's when we'll all be
lobbying hard for our numbers,” Nalikak
says. .

' ANWR
UPDATE

Governor Steve Cowper has advertised
in Alaska for a lobbying ﬁrm and a
public relations company to help press
the state's efforts before Congress to
open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
to oil exploration and development.

Solicitations are also being sent to
companies that have expressed an interest

in the project. Each contract is for about
$9,000 a month and will complement
the. work of state officials in the
govemor‘s ofﬁce in Washington, DC.

"Congressional debate on whether to
open ANWR is gearing up," Cowper
says. "We'll need a full court press to
convince members of Congress to permit
exploration and development, and that's
rwhy we're looking for help with
lobbying and public information."

The lobbying contract seeks a
company with established relations with
key members of Congress, especially the
leadership and members of those
committees which will review ANWR
legislation. The ﬁrm will be used to
enhance the state's efforts and will be
directed by Cowper's Washington ofﬁce.

The public relations contract
emphasizes contact with Outside media,
and the company selected will prepare
and distribute press kits and provide
regular information to key media. The

effort also includes coordination of a

grassroots campaign to push for ANWR
development.
Written proposals for both contracts

are due by June 8 to John Katz, director

of State/Federal Relations and head of the
state's Washington ofﬁce. Proposals
will be reviewed and selected by a panel
headed by Kat};

Cowper strongly supports opening
ANWR to oil exploration and
deve10pment He also favors reviewing

development activity in the relatively
small core caribou calving area identiﬁed

by both state and federal wildlife
biologists to determine whether
development will disrupt caribou
calving.

As the State organizes its ANWR
effort, prestigious east coast newspapers
are pooh pahing Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel's assertion that
development of the coastal plain.is
essential to US. security but advocating
the wisdom of knowing much more
about what oil reserves are actually
present so that in the future,
deve10pment can be undertaken when it
isactually needed.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - May 31, 1987

tucer seeking
families fOr TV pilot

By WALT BELCHER
Tribune Television Writer

TAMPA —-— A television produc-
er is seeking Bay area families to
help make a pilot for a proposed TV
series, “All About Animals,” to be

filmed at Busch Gardens on Satur-

day.

John Paling, a film maker who
has produced numerous wildlife
documentaries for the BBC and
PBS, said he wants to break into
i commercial television with a wild-
life magazine/game show.

“People are fascinated by ani-
mals, and I think we can have some
fun,” he said. “I’ve been making

. these nature documentaries such as ‘

‘The Realm of the Alligator,’ a Na-
tional Geographic special that aired
last year, but I thought it would be
good to make a program which lets
ordinary people deal with animals.”

The program would be based at
Busch Gardens in Tampa but would

include segments fromthroughout .

the world.

Paling said that his proposed se-
ries, “All About Animals,” would
feature families playing guessing
games about the “mystery animal of
the week” and that there would be
segments in which family members
would play a short quiz on animals,
or would have a “wildlife wish”
granted. “For example, on our first
show we send a 13-year-old who is
mad about butterflies to Mexico and
put him in the middle of 70 million
, Monarch butterflies,” Paling said. ’
‘ Another segment would feature

celebrity pets and domesticated ani-
mals. ‘

Paling said 'he needs at least
eight groups of people to be the
“contestants/guests.”

A screening for contestants will
be from noon to 8 pm. Tuesday at
the Holiday-Inn, 2701 E. Fowler
Ave. ‘ ‘ '

“I’m looking for families who
are .- lively and have vitality,” he
said. “It could be a mother and fa-
ther and children, or single parents
and their children, or grandparents
and children" .any combinations of
small groups’

Participants will not be paid, but
they will get free admission to
Busch Gardens on Saturday. Paling
said he plans to videotape his pro-
gram at 1 pm. in the Stanleyville
Theatre.

Paling, who is well-known
among nature photographers, has
hired veteran television producer Al
Rogers to oversee his pilot. Rogers
is the producer of the new Dolly
Parton ABC series and has pro-
duced numerous variety programs.

Paling Said “All About Animals”
will feature Jan Jones, an anchor
and television personality from
Cleveland, Ohio.‘ Paling also will ap-
pear on the program as an animal
expert.

He said that if the series can be
sold in syndication, he’d produce 26
half-hour episodes per year. The se-
ries would be syndicated like “Wild

tions buy the program, it could be-
gin production in the fall, Paling
said.

Would-be contestants who want
more information may call John

Dog Dealings

A Georgia judge has sentenced a
couple to prison after they were con-
victed of 109 counts of cruelty to ani-
mals. In addition, the judge said that
Dale Francis Phillips and Bobette Marie
Phillips of Gwinnett County would re-
main on probation for life.

The couple pleaded guilty to the cru-
elty charges and to running a kennel
without a license. According to court
documents, they ran a “puppy farm”
where several kinds of dogs, including
poodles and schnauzers, were bred in a
windowless barn, 10 animals to a cage.

Police investigated in December
after receiving complaints from the Hu-
mane Society and the American Kennel
Club. The groups said the Phillipses
were selling puppies, which died soon
after purchase, at $200 to $1 ,000 each.

Superior Court Judge Bryant Huff
sentenced Dale Phillips to two years in
jail. Bobette, additionally charged with
obstructing a police ofﬁcer in the course
of a legal search, received three years.

Huff ordered the couple to pay the
$16,505 it has cost the county to house
the 109 dogs that were seized. Fifteen
dogs died soon after the raid, but homes
have been found for the remaining 94
and for 20 pups born to survivors.

OOKING INTO one of histo-

ry’s most clouded crystal
balls, the director of the US. Pa-
tent Ofﬁce predicted, “Every-
thing that can be invented has
been invented.” His name was
Charles H. Duell. The year was
1899. ‘

In the new century that fol-
lowed that ﬂawed prophecy, a
good number of things have been
invented, and many millions
have been patented. No patented
products have been smaller than
the bacterium, which, having a

‘unique appetite for feeding on

petroleum, was determined to be
patentable by the Supreme Court
in 1980. And no questions about
the status of organic life have
been larger than those now need—
ing to be considered in respect to
patenting animals.

On April 3, the federal Patent
and Trademark Ofﬁce ruled that
variants of animal species pro-
duced by methods of gene-splic-
ing are eligible for patenting.

As an ofﬁcer of the agency,
Charles E. Van Horn, explained,
animals to be covered under the
new policy “have to be somehow
created by man.”

This new policy, however le-
gally proper, should have been,
and needs to be discussed by
many representatives of the na-
tion’s citizens. People are now
raising questions about the tech-
nical feasibility of “creating” new
animals, as well as about the
moral probity and social effects
of patenting them.

Five questions merit serious at-
tention. These do not challenge
the legitimacy or doubt the value
and human beneﬁt of genetic en-
gineering. Neither do they dis-
pute the acceptable policy of pa-
tenting processes of producing
variant organisms. Only the pa-
tenting of animal products is at
issue.

I Is there a real difference be-
tween naturally evolved organ-
isms and those “created” by hu-
man prowess? To create means
to bring into existence something
that is uniquely novel. “All crea-

tures great and small” are termed .3

creator.

centuries, has eventuated in vari—
eties of horses for showing and
racing, dogs and cats for petting,
pigeons for pride of ownership
and livestock and poultry for nu-
trition and other uses. These ani-
mals are not patentable because

‘. they are regarded as “natural,”

despite the human control of '
breeding.

Modifying animals by genetic
manipulation is judged to be of 'a
different category. - .

Genomes (a set of chromo—
somes) may be quickly changed

: ,by inserting genes into newly fer-
tilized embryonic cells before im-
' plantation in a uterus. The ani-
’mal’s

characteristics can be
slightly changed and passed on
to progeny.

' pear in nature? Obviously, no.

j I Do animals have such rights
to their own lives and species in—‘
itegrity that modiﬁcation of them
land patenting them are offenses
against nature? This is a philo-
sophical and theological matter.
One’s View of it depends upon an
{understanding of animals’ rela-

‘ition to humanity. Western civili—

zation has been inﬂuenced by the
biblical teaching of human do-
minion over all animals, includ-
,ing the right to eat them. This
fwas the divine license received
:by Noah after the great ﬂood:
“Every moving thing that lives
‘shall be food for you.”

‘ If patenting is secured for a
modiﬁed animal, it does no more
harm to the animal than register-
ing a certain breed. As for hy-
bridization, it is not self-evidently
wrong, but is deemed so by per-
sons who regard nature as ﬁxed
for all time.

 

 

 

 

 

 




Jib Will patenting of modiﬁed” ?
' animals hinder medical research? 3

Already many scientists have ex—

pressed concern over restrictions '

- of the ﬂow of information in the
ﬁeld of molecular biology. The
' possibilities of proﬁtability of re-
search have made researchers
more competitive, secretive and
protectionist. Certainly research

, will be adversely affected.

’3 I Is the economic motivation
for this initiative unethical? It
may be irritating to some peo-
ple’s sensibilities. But as long as
there has been a semblance of
free enterprise, people have been

selling animals. Genetic science“

has simply elevated the ﬁnancial
stakes. '

I Does the new patent policy
threaten the lives of human be-
ings? Not for the present. Possi-
bly for the future. Van Horn an-

nounced that the patent policy,

“could be extrapolated to human
beings,” but added, “for the time
being we are not going to consid-
er applications involving human
life.” Was that a careless remark

or a dark prophecy? How long is .

“the time being?” During only
the past 20 years, the processes
of in vitro fertilization and gene-
splicing have been made practi-
cable. The rate of research is ac-
celerating, and the American
public is confronted every month
or week with some reproductive
or therapeutic innovation.

The collective public. mind is
rapidly learning to absorb many
strange achievements with frozen
human embryos, Surrogate wives,
mechanical hearts, multiple or-

gan transplants and manipulaa

tions of brain activity. In the
, waves of amazing news reports,
people are losing their protective
incredulity about what is both
possible and permissible to do to
the human organism. The easy

acceptance of the idea of cloning

tissue illustrates their love of sci—
entiﬁc fantasy. However, the
truth of what is being done now
is stranger than recent ﬁction. In
some regards, Aldous Huxley’s
famous novel. “Brave New
World” was not imaginative
enough!

Huxley did not anticipate ge-
netic engineering. But in his ﬁc-
tional society, babies are artiﬁ-
cially gestated in factories, and
they are “decanted” rather than

born. They are custom-made to.

. menial service, inma chillingly sci-

entiﬁc caste system. Some Amer-

ican “ethicists” have commended

comparable production of hu-
mans or human-like beings. Oth~
ers see human fetuses as suitable
growers of tissues and organs for
therapeutic purposes. And,
though the present art of genetic
intervention cannot signiﬁcantly
alter physical characteristics,
there are possibilities of turning
yesterday’s science ﬁction into
tomorrow’s science fact about hu-
‘man beings. - '
The patenting of animals, in

., sum, is a most ambiguous matter.
‘ The Patent Ofﬁce has rushed to a

decision without allowing for rea—
sonable consideration by the peo-

. ple it serves. \

church says
city stalling

By Jeanne DeQuine
USA TODAY

HIALEAH, Fla. — City ofﬁ-
cials say they’re only following
procedures, but the leader of a
church which practices animal
sacriﬁce accuses them, of vio-
lating religious freedom.

“They’re giving us the run-
around,” Ernesto' Pichardo,
president of the Church of Lu-
kumi Babalu-aye, said Sunday.

He said he ﬁlled an applica-
tion to convert a small building
into a church three weeks ago,
but city ofﬁcials still haven’t
said when they’ll act on it.

The faith, called santeria,
was first practiced by African
slaves in Cuba. It combines Af-
rican beliefs and Catholicism.
Animals sacrificed include
birds and goats.

Dan DeLoach, city chief of
staff, said the city isn’t out to
get the church: “As long as they
comply with normal channels
of law, there’s nothing the city
can do. We’ve been advised
that the law allows animal sac-
riﬁces for religious purposes.”

Hialeah residents appear di-
vided. “I have no use for
them,” said Naomi Pego.

But follower Carman Bla
said her faith is “a religion of
love and peace.”

Pichardo sees a constitution-
al issue: “We. Cubans came
here for freedom of religion
and speech. It’s the very thing
being challenged here.” ,

Pet From the Brink of Death

Scott Stewart thought

his world had ended as
he faced life, from a
wheelchair, but a spunky

Labrador retriever pulle.

_ ed him from his depres-
sion -- and Scott repaid
the favor five months lat-
er by nursing the pooch
back from the brink of
death after it was hit by a
car.

“If Ian were to die, there
didn’t seem to be much left
in the world for me,” said 17-
year-old Scott, recalling the
dark days after his dog was
hit by a car.

“But he got better -—— just
to please me. He’ll do every-
thing he can to please!”

The pair’s heartwarming
story began in tragedy —- in
March 1985, Scott was criti-
cally injured while racing
his motorbike. His spinal
cord was severely damaged,
leaving his legs useless.

“I was very, very .de-
pressed," recalls Scott, who
lives in San Jose, Calif. “I
didn’t want to go back to
school, because I didn’t want
pitying looks. I didn’t even.
want to keep up my physical
therapy. There didn’t seem“

to be much left in lifeworth
living for."
But luckily, in May 1986

Scott’s parents enrolled him ‘

in a program called Canine

ence, which provides spe-
cially trained dogs for handi-
capped people. After trying

Now Scott and Ian are so
close they sleep in the same
bed. But besides being a pal,

'Ian is also Scott’s all-around

helpmate.

He fetches the phone and
flicks light switches with his
mouth.

Ian even goes to school
with Scott every day, pulling
his wheelchair around the
Saratoga High School cam-
pus, and sitting quietly in
his classes. -

Last October, while Scott
and Ian were getting out of a
friend’s car, Ian ran into the
street -- and was hit by a
car. Horrified, Scott and his
friend rushed Ian to a veteri-
narian.

“A lot of dogs would not
have survived,” said Dr. An~

, drew Kestler, the vet who

treated him. “He ruptured
his lung, and was hemor-
rhaging into the lung and
chest cavity. It was touch
and go for 48 hours.”

Said Scott, “It was awful. I
couldn’t imagine life without
him. Thinking he would die
was like being back in the
depths of the pit again ~-

Happily, Ian is his old self .

Scott’s life, and brought.

“been used for personal consumption, or

traded for cash on the way to Asian mar-

pensive source of meat,” Brame explains. .

Even more alarming, according to ex-. ’
:perts, is the increasing prOportion of illegal
wildlife products purchased in America’s
growing Asian communities. There is '
enough demand for these products as me- .

dicinal aids and as aphrodisiacs to create
lucrative market. _

- “We are just touching the surface of the practice
' of using wildlife parts for Oriental medicine,” says
. Jerome S. Smith, deputy chief in the Division of Law
Enforcement for the US. Fish and Wildlife Service.
“And we see similar examples in virtually all ani-

mals. We have got to do something to break
through the cultural barriers and attack their beliefs
in these products.”

The rapid rise in illegal trade has forced the Fish .

and Wildlife Service to go undercover.

“These bear hunters are tough people,” says
North Carolina Game Warden Roger D. Gibby. “The
people I’ve talked to don’t want to come forward be-
cause they are scared,” he says.

Game wardens have the highest assault rate of
any field of law enforcement. In North Carolina,
there are only two wardens per county, on average,
to deal with law breakers. . .

Col. Gerald Simmons is the chief of law enforce-
ment for the Virginia Commission of Game and In-
land Fisheries. Earlier this month, some of his under-
cover officers, working with federal agents, arrested
11 peOple allegedly involved in an illegal deer-hunting
ring suspected of bagging 300 to 500 deer a year.

“We are talking about a bunch of guys who would
do whatever it took to make few dollars,” Simmons
says.
However, not all poaching is for commercial
markets.

Many parts of the country are experiencing grow-
ing numbers of illegal road hunters, peOple who
cruise rural roads at night looking for deer. Using a

_ powerful spotlight, they search for a pair of eyes, hop

out of their vehicle and Open fire. Landowners are

_ frightened, property gets damaged and domestic cat-

tle and pets have been killed.

In one sting Operation run in northwestern Virgin-
ia, virtually every car that passed a stuffed deer on a
rural road stopped and Opened fire. Only local resi—
dents drove past without firing a shot.

According to Dennis C. Eggers, assistant director
for hunter services at the National Rifle Association
(NRA), the three types of offenders include:

I Those ignorant of hunting laws.

I Opportunists, who normally obey the law but
who will take what they think is a unique Opportunity
to kill wildlife.

I Flagrant violators, who leave their homes with
the intent to break the law. -

Hunting organizations such as the NRA have tak-
en strong positions against poachers and road

» hunters.

“Nobody wants to clean up hunting more than
hunters,” says Eggers. “The impact of the flagrant
violators is the worst.” '

The NRA stresses hunting ethics in its Basic '
Hunter’s Guide, which is used in hunting education .

classes throughout the country.
All states offer hunter education programs for
those applying for hunting licenses; in 36 states, the
programs are mandatory.
But not everyone is convinced these courses are

ByrENNY M. CARNATHAN
Tribune Staff Writer

lTAMPA — In times of crisis,

sellers of feathers flock together.

"So say the owners and managers
of four pet shops —- in Largo, Tam-
pa and northwestern Hillsborough
County — whose teamwork led to

the recovery Wednesday of two.

rare birds and a canary, and to the
arrests of two men on charges of
dealing in stolen property.

“‘It’s an interesting thing,” said
Bill Leon, a department manager at
Petiand Central, 2907 N. Dale Ma-
bry Highway, where the arrests

took place. “Everything’s competi-

tion until a bird gets stolen.”

, The two baby lilac-crown Ama-
zon parrots, valued at $700 each,
were stolen Monday from Animal
Tracks pet store in Largo, according
to police officials and shop owner
Kathleen Forsythe.

Forsythe said two men came in-
to her store and one “caused a di-
version in one part of the store,
while the other made off with the
birds.’_’ '

She reported the thefts to the
Largo Police Department, but she
also called various pet stores to no-
tify them.

Late Wednesday afternoon, two
men arrived at Safari Pets, 14624 N.
Dale Mabry Highway, with a baby
lilac-crown Amazon parrot, accord-
ing to. police records and the store’s
owner.

They wanted to sell the bird, but
owner Grant Edlck declined. One of

the men let a bird out of a cage in
the store, and the pair left.

Edick said he noticed a $50 sing-
ing canary was missing.

“I called the pet stores nearest
to me and warned them in case
two guys came in with a canary for
sale,” he said.

Next, the two men showed up at
Perfect Pets, 13149 N. Dale Mabry
Highway. There, according to sher-
iff’s records and salesman Tim Ha-

~ zlett, they tried again to sell the par-

rots.
“We told them ‘no’ and called
Petiand” to warn that store, he said.

Petiand already had heard from
Largo’s Forsythe.

Thirty minutes after the call
from Perfect Pets, Petland’s Leon
said two men came into the store
trying to sell some birds.

The two were told they’d have to
wait for “the gentleman who would
buy the birds” and Leon called the
Tampa Police Department.-

The two parrots were recovered
in good condition, but the canary
had been stuffed in a Gatorade bot-
tie.

“I had to break the bottle to get
him out,” Edick said. “That bird
will be stressed for a week.”

Being held Thursday at the
Hillsborough County Jail were Wil-
liam Matthew Edwards, 27, of 5329
Garden Lane, and Steven James
Birtzer, 25, of 4500 N. Rome Ave.,
#J3ll. Both were charged with two
counts of dealing in stolen property
and bail for each was $5,000.

PEOPLE MAGAZINE - Mayll,

 

When people start squabbling about dogs,
“they’re ready to klll,” says Margolis
(posing on the set of We Superior Court).

No doubt about it, Fritz (not his real
name) was a problem dog. His owners
couldn’t keep him inside at night be-
cause he chewed the furniture. Out-
side, however,'he never stopped bark-
ing. The neighbors complained, the
owners became adamant, tempers-
flared and attorneys were hired. Clear-
ly, this was a case for Doggy Court.
Located in Beverly Hills (where
else?) and created by former Deputy
City Attorney Steven Rood and dog
trainer Matthew Margolis, Doggy Court
is the nation’s first private mediation
service devoted exclusively to canine-
related disputes. “Passions run very

high in these cases,” says Rood, 37,
who notes that before Doggy Court ex-
isted each side in I’affaire Fritz had
forked out “$30,000 minimum” in legal
fees. Appalled, Rood tried to mediate
rather than prosecute for the city, but
he didn’t know enough about pooches.
Enter Margolis, 45, co-author of When
Good Dogs Do Bad Things, who volun-
teered to donate his services.

As they’ve sinCe done with all
cases, Rood had both sides sit down
and tell their stories to Margolis, who
compiled in-depth profiles of the hu-
mans. “lt’s the people who drive dogs
crazy,” explains Margolis. “I’m the ob-

The free service has proved a howl-
ing success. Since its inception last

' May, 30 cases—mostly involving bark—

ing, biting and blighted flower beds—
have been settled in Doggy Court.
Rood, who’s now in private practice,
plans to help Margolis market the con-
cept nationally. As for Fritz, Margolis
determined that the dog was ill-man-
nered because of improper training
and recommended a six-week house-
breaking course. “Now the dog stays
indoors at night, behaves well and ev-
erybody’s happy,” says Margolis.
“Case closed.” E]

The announcement that there will

, be deer hunts in three Missouri state
’ parks this fall was made with the
T same joy with which a person swal-
: lows a dose of nasty-tasting medicine.

Maybe you missed the story in the
Post-Dispatch on May 8. It said that
deer hunts would be set at Knob Nos-
ter, Pershing and Thousand Hills
,State Parks this fall. Frederick A.
Brunner, director of the Division of
Natural Resources, took great pains
to point out that the hunt was being
authorized only to control an over-
population of deer. “These are not
recreational hunts,” he said. One
could almost imagine the sour look
on his face.

Everybody else echoed the it’s-a-

nasty-job-but-necessary attitude. Ed-

Stegner of the Conservation Federa-
tion of Missouri was quoted as saying
he believed his group’s members
would support the hunt “as long as it’s
. being done to control
, overpopulation." -

Charles Callison of the Missouri

Parks Association said “hunting is out

,of place in a state park except under
extraordinary circumstances.” He
added that he didn’t believe those cir-
cumstances exist.

Roger Pryor, the Coalition for the
Environment’s always-available
spokesman on all things environmen-
tal, was “strongly critical” of the pro-
posed hunt. He wanted the hunting

done by “professional wildlife

managers.”

The this-year-only hunt was au-,

thorized after park biologists con-
ducted a study that showed there
were too many deer in those parks,
and that the deer were doing damage
to fauna in the parks and crops on
private land outside the parks.

It would seem everybody's got this
' backwards. Hunting in the parks

. ecological necessity. Hunting is a le-

gitimate form of recreation which,
with proper safeguards, has a place

in the state park system.

The Division of Parks takes. great

pains to provide facilities for other.

users, such as off-road vehicle own-
ers (see below). Hunters are Missouri
taxpayers, too.

Brunner said that hunts in the

parks would be during the November
‘statewideiﬁirearms deer season and

that during the hunt, the three parks
would be closed to other uses. Closing
the parks, though, would be no more
than a gesture since almost nobody

uses the parks in November anyway. .

And that’s the point.
Most of Missouri’s parks are little-

. used during late-fail and winter. In _

some of the larger parks, such as
Lake of the Ozarks, there are places
that nobody ever goes. Even in the
developed areas, such as camp-
grounds, you could shoot a cannon or

conduct a full-scale artillery duel in-

the winter without hurting anybody.

And, no, there is no law against

hunting in state parks. The DNR has,
by law, broad authority to manage
the parks to maintain them as natural
resources. Included in this authority

is allowing or not allowing hunting. It‘,

has authorized deer hunts in the past.

, Hunting could be a compatible use
in some parks. It would have to be
restricted to certain areas and cer-
tain seasons. Many states, including
Illinois, consider hunting as a legiti-
mate form of recreation in their state
parks.

Fishing is allowed in many Miss--
ouri parks. What’s the difference be-
tween fishing and hunting? '

The argument that parks should be
preserves, places where people can
see wildlife “in the natural state,” is
romantic baloney. Missouri has been
holding hunting seasons on turkey
since 1960, hunting seasons on deer
since 1944 and hunting seasons on
squirrels since forever. One can see
turkeys, deer and squirrels all over
the place.

As for Pryor’s idea of having pro-
fessionals thin the deer, that’s a half-

times in many places with no success.
At Shaw’s Garden Arboretum at

deer hunt last fall. _ .
Superintendent John *Behrer said

the hunt was held after officials had .

considered all other alternatives, in-
cluding trapping the deer (live and
moving them elsewhere, and found it
would have cost $700 for each deer.

Dog attack Victim

TOWN ’N COUNTRY - Howard
Kleinatland Sr. has a message for
his friends: His ‘l30-pound pit bull
“Chopper” wasn’t the one that at-
tacked and chewed on him Tues-
day.

A pit bull jumped Kleinatland,
50, owner of Big Red’s Auto Repair
at 6530 W. Hillsborough Ave., at 6:50
am. Tuesday near his shop, accord-
ing to Hillsborough County Sheriff’s
Office reports. Kleinatland went to
the hospital with bites on both fore-
arms and a badly injured righ
hand. . ~

Kleinatland said no bones were
broken or tendons severed, and he
returned to work later that day.

Emmett Rawls, owner of the dog'

that attacked Kleinatland, has re-
leased the animal to the custody of

trol, said‘ Lynn Goldie, deputy direc— ,
tor of Animal Control.

The dog is under a 10-day quar-
antine, and a decision has yet to be
made regarding its fate, she said.

Kleinatland said some confusion
resulted over the identity of the dog ‘
that hit him. Kleinatland, wanting to
talk to his lawyer first, declined
comment to the Tribune at the time ‘
of the incident, and a Sheriff’s Of-
fice report did not include the own- '
er of the dog.

The man’s phone rang off the
hook for three days, he said, as peo-
ple assumed it was his dog -— a cus- ,
tomer favorite — that hit him.

“I just want everybody to know
that he still loves me, he still licks
me” and that the two are still pals,
Kleinatland said.

 




HOUSTON POST - May 25. 1987

Animals rank high with military

EDITOR’S NOTE: Once again
we celebrate Memorial Day. It ’s not
just another holiday, it’s much
more than that. Today is a special
time for all Americans to acknowl-
edge the millions of men and wom—
en who have served this nation
during war and peace. Last year, in
this column, Dr. Robert 0. Shan-
non took some liberties with the
Memorial Day celebration and
fasked that we also salute the brave

' “little mascots who were associated
"with the military services. The col-
umn was so well-received, as evi-
‘denced by the numerous calls and
letters, that he wanted to share it

“with you again. . .

"* emorial Day is a time to
3; shout to the entire world
' ’ that we’re proud to be

f—Americans, and it’s also a time to
reminisce about events or experi-
ence which occurred during those
" ears of military service. Most of us
immediately reﬂect on the many
friends we made in all parts of the -
_ world. .
“ While reﬂecting, think about the
many animal friends who, so often,
;_ became integral members of the
military mission and the important
.;;:;role they played in our lives. It is
gheir Memorial Day, also.
g * One of my most pleasant memo-
" ries dates back to an assignment in
Korea and one little bedraggled
dog who helped sustain many lives

3'1" ‘

I’ll always remember Kimchi _
. and, hopefully, thousands of others
’ like him also will be thought of to-
; day. Most ex—military personnel
reading this column can probably
krelate to a companion pet who 3
; helped them through some difficult
j. times. ,

One of the most famous of all
{mascots was “Schatzie,” a dachs-
1.” hund who served as mascot of the
s‘attack carrier U.S.S. Oriskany dur—
3‘: ing the Korean War.
5 Taken on board in Tripoli, Schat-
Ti zie served three years of sea duty,
5; including one year of combat. She
i”, was eventually awarded the Na-
Er tional Defense Service Ribbon, the
Korean Service Ribbon, the Korean
" Presidential Unit Citation, the Unit-
; ed Nations Service Ribbon, the Chi-
na Service Ribbon and the Purple
: Heart. 3
In 1952, Schatzie whelped a ht-

:‘tfﬁ

C"?!

ter of pups during intense combat E -

operations. The pups were later raf- * -

' fled to crewmen. Before leaving

g the ship in the autumn of 1954,

Schatzie had two additional litters
and raised more than $20,000 in
puppy rafﬂes. The money was used
to build a home in Japan for Ameri-
can-fathered Japanese orphans.
The home was named “The Oris-

; kanyHome.”

during some difﬁCUlt 3 _' :

times. Very little
was known about
his ancestry as he
was obviously a
“mutt.” No one
-.-knew when or how
;he arrived on the
military base.
.J This dirty, shag-
” gy, heavily parasit-
ized, emaciated, 20-pound brown
dog simply showed up one day

and, in retrospect, it would be diffi-

cult to determine who was the

most excited -— the dog or the Gls. ‘-

He was named “Kimchi” and
the tremendous bonding that de-
veloped between the 013 and Kim-
chi exemplified every positive fac-
tor known about the human-

; “animal companionship. '

[a Kimchi became a friend to all

if, and a quasi-psychologist to many
.‘as he always seemed to understand

. each individual’s problems. Rank
? meant absolutely nothing to Kim? ,3
rchi. He loved the basic airman as -
7 much as he did the colonel. Kimchi "

. remained in Korea and I heard sev-

‘eral years later that he was still the '

No. I mascot. 3

3 In 1941, a paratroo
tioned at Fort Benning, (3a., had an
unusual mascot —- a fox. Securely
bundled inside a trooper’s gear,
this exotic pet made 27 jumps. In
France during World War I, nearly
every company of US. Marines had
its own mascot. Of them, Jimmy
the Anteater, achieved the most

3 notoriety. Actually Jimmy turned

out to be a coatimundi and not an
aardvark. He was brought to
France by Marines stationed in
Central America, and often accom-
panied the Marines into the front
line trenches.

Murphy the cat, a famous mascot

i in World War II, was an integral

member of the destroyer “Blue,”

.. one of the fighting ships of the Sol-

per outfit Sta-“- -.-3

l

 

Omon Island‘s area. Murphy sur—

E vived the sinking of the “Blue” and

eventually landed in Sydney, Aus-
tralia on the cruiser “Canberra.”

. Another famous World War II mas-

cot was H.E. (High Explosive)
Kelly. This dog was destined for
sea duty as he was born aboard a
ship in the Atlantic. HE. Kelly
eventually served on two oceans
and was on land only twice -— on

- the docks of Honolulu and on the
, battle-scarred beaches of Eniwe-
- ; tok.

Interestingly, H.E. Kelly was list—

‘ .ed on the ship’s muster as a gun-
ner’s mate, second class; however,

; later reports state that he was pro-

: moted because of exceptional

barking during combat operations

at Saipan.
Undoubtedly, there are numer-

,- ous stories similar to these. Mas-

cots with names such as Scuttle-

‘ butt, Butch, Sinbad, Zero, Minnie-
the-Moocher, EightBall, Jinx,
Rum—and-Coke, Salty, Rebel,

3 Hasso, etc. may bring back fond
memones.

We mustn’t forget that these lit-

tle companion pets were heroes,

.; too. Nor should we forget the thou—

Fairfax Police Chief Walt Potter, one of those
, who had befriended Heidi, called the shooting “a
tragedy.”

He said a departmental investigation is under
way. Police Department policy requires an investi-
gation whenever an officer discharges his weapon.

The reaction among downtown residents and
merchants yesterday began with shock, turned to
sorrow and by late afternoon blossomed into anger
toward officer Johnston.

“This 18 a tow n that loves dogs and hates guns, ”
said Ed MC Gill a law y or whose office ov erlooks the
city park where Heidi was killed. “I’m outraged.
The town is outraged.”

Added another passer-by, “We’ve got to get
these quickdraw artists out from behind badges.”

Becky Fox, a local flower merchant, brought a ‘

wreath of flowers to put beside the fallen animal,
whose body Crane at first would not allow to be
moved. “I used to feed Heidi almost every day,” she
said. “it won’t be the same here without Heidi.

DENVER POST - Maw 22, 1987

By Knight-Bidder News Service

WASHINGTON — After spend-
ing $51 million over the, last three
years to round up and feed thou-
sands of wild horses and burros,
the Bureau of Land Management
now proposes to kill as many as
10, 000 of them.

That will leave about 44,000 wild
horses and burros grazing on pub-
lic lands. The bureau then wants to
round up 14,000 of those animals. If
they are not adopted by private cit-
izens within 90 days, they too would
be killed at a cost of $35 each.

It is a long bureaucratic trail
that has led the wild horses and
burros from the range to their cur~
rent precarious status -— facing
death by lethal injection.

Since 1971, the number of wild
horses and burros has grown from
1,700. They have had to share a di-
minishing amount of food with do.
mestic cattle and sheep whose

,, owners pay for the grazing rights

to the public land. Both the bureau
and environmental groups agree
that the quality of public lands IS in
a serious decline because of
“over- grazing. ”

The bureau has responded since
1974 by rounding up the horses and
burros, corralling them' in huge
pens and offering them for, adop-
tion through its Adopt-A-Horse pro-
gram. But the adoption program
has not been a booming success
and the government. is left with a
$25, 000 a- day bill for feeding the
10, 000 horses and burros it can’t get
rid 0f.

“Despite our best efforts, the
population is growing by leaps and
bounds,” said Mark Guidry, a
spokesman for the bureau.

Power never used

The bureau has never used its
Congress-given power to “destroy”
unadoptable horses and burros, but
now a bureau advisory group has
recommended killing the animals
as one option for reducing the num-
ber of horses and burros.

Other options include improving
the adoption program by offering
animals more cheaply or having
prisoners train the horses to make
them more attractive to adoptive

‘ parents

If those proposals don’t work,

 

“I just don’t like putting
down a healthy
animal.”

Doris Goodlander

 

the advisory board recommends
killng any animals that go una-
dopted for more than 90 days. A fi-
nal decision on the policy is not. ex-
pected until the summer.

The bureau has found that the
stunning finality of its proposal has
raised more than a cry from the
public. “Obviously it’s not a popu-
lar thing to do, to destroy healthy
animals,” said Mark Guidry, the
spokesman for the Bureau of Land
Management in the Department of
Interior.

Rose Strickland, a national Sier-
ra Club official from Reno, Nev.,
accuses the bureau of “manufac~
turing a crisis.’

Strickland and others fighting
the bureau’s proposal point out
that domestic animals — cows,
sheep and goats — outnumber the
wild horses and burros 98 to one,
4.3 million to 44,000. The Bureau
leases grazing rights to the ranch-
ers who own the domesticated ani-
mals

Grazing cost

The ranchers pay $1. 35 per ani-
mal per month, three to five times
below the grazing costs for an ani-
mal on private land.

Russ Gaspar, the Washington
lawyer for the American Horse
Protection Association, said that
the bureau’s proposal to kill the
wild animals while subsidizing the
grazing costs of domestic livestock
represents “a fairly clear trade of
resources?’

If and when the proposal is car-
ried out, it is certain to cause an
uproar.

Doris Goodlander, who with her
husband, Frank, runs one the of hu-
reau’s adoption centers on their
138-acre farm in Lewisberry, Pa,
said the whole idea troubles her.

“I just don't like putting down a .
healthy animal,” she said.

 




SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

, By Erik. Ingram 4

Val Crane, a homeless old man, buried his
beloved pet. dog, Heidi, in a redwood grove
yesterday as the town of Fairfax mourned.

Heidi, a furry silver keeshond was shot to death.

Thursday night by police officer Dan Johnston
when the dog challenged him as he approached
. Crane’s parked van near Fairfax’s Town Park.

Johnston, a veteran of the Fairfax Police De-
partment, told his superiors he did not realize the
dog was tied up, and feared she was going to injure
him.

Heidi was not only Crane’s best friend, but was .

a popular fixture of the laid-back scene in down-
town Fairfax, where her bright eyes and wagging
tail earned rib bones from merchants and pats on
the head from passers~by. »

“I don’t understand why he did it,” a tearful
Crane said as people stopped at his van to express
sympathy."‘Heidi never hit anyone. She had a game
of catching squirrels but she always let them go
unharmed.” .

Crane, a 66¥year-old Social Security recipient,
said he acquired Heidi from the pound in Everett,
- Wash, “one day before she was to be destroyed.”

“I looked at her and said, ‘1 want a smart dog
because I don’t need a stupid one.’ She looked at me
with an expression that said, “OK, let’s go.’ ” That

was five years ago. Crane said the two had never

spent a day apart since then.

. “She lived in the front of the van and I lived in
the back,” Crane said. ‘She took care of security and
I took care of the food.”

According to Crane, he was sitting in the back
of his van at the city park Thursday night when a
patrol car pulled up behind at about 10:30.

“I saw a flashlight go by and Heidi barked and
boltedout, but she was on a leash. The next thing I
know there was a shot and Heidi was bleeding on
the ground with half her head gone.

“1 said, ‘What’8 going on?’ and the officer said,
‘I just. shot your dog. She attacked me; ..

Crane, a slightly built man with a full, white ‘ ’

beard, sat forlornly on a park bench at Town Park
late yesterday afternoon, and choked back tears. He
said he could not understand w

“Heidi shouldn’t have died like this. She was

i just doing what she was supposed to do,” he said.

“I looked for something holy to put in her grave
but all I had was a quarter and a Scent postage

: stamp so I put those in,” he said sadly. “I told her to

she would have liked it.”

The two were periodic visitors to Fairfax, usu-

FT. LAUDERDALE SUH- SENTINEL - May 27,1987

capture 01 reptile
easier than disposal,
hunter has learned

 

United Press International

MIAMI — Veteran reptile hunter
Jeff Grigg easily captured the 4 V:-
foot caiman that menaced holiday
beachgoers on Key Biscayne, but
getting rid of the animal, an ag-
gressive cousin of the alligator,
proved more difficult on Tuesday.

Grigg planned to drop off the cai~
man at Miami’s Metrozoo, which
had adopted the ‘7-foot African
crocodile he captured at Crandon
Park Beach last June. But Metro-
zoo representatives politely de-
clined, saying the zoo didn’t have
room for the caiman.

Grigg is looking for another zoo
or an animal dealer to take it. The
law prevents him from releasing it
because caimans are not native to
Florida, and it is too large and too
aggressive to keep as a pet.

In the meantime, the 50-pOund
reptile is securely immobilized
with duct tape inside a box in the
back of Grigg’s battered blue sta-
tion wagon,

“I’m probably the only guy in Mi-
ami running around with a 4 V:-
foot caiman in my car,” Grigg said.
“I still have him taped up good. I
don’t want him climbing out while
I‘m driving down Interstate 95.”

Grigg, a boat mechanic who runs
the non-profit Reptile Rescue Ser-
vice from his home on Key Bis-
cayne, was called to remove the
caiman from the Crandon Park
Beach on Monday evening.

“It came up out of the woods and
scared some people to death,” he
said.

Grigg sneaked up behind the ani-
mal and slowly reached around and
clamped its jaws shut. He threw his
weight across the caiman to hold it
while park manager Tony Dushell
taped its snout shut and bound its

egs

Grigg said the caiman probably
was a pet that had outgrown its
welcome. Adult caimans can reach
6 to 8 feet.

“When baby alligators were eut-
lawed as pets, they started import-
ing these caimans from South
America in huge numbers. People
found they got a little too large to
take care of. It probably got too big
and maybe hit their kid or some-
thing, so they decided to dump it in
the canal.”

The caiman appears to be 4 or.5
years old and probably had lived in
or near the park for several years.

 

Two manatees
to be released,
but dolphin dies

United Press international

MIAMI - Two manatees
rescued from a dead-end ca-
nal were nursed back to
health and will be released
today back to the wild, Miami
Seaquarium officials said,
but a dolphin they rescued
has died.

Sebastian and Sirena, res-
cued from the canal on the
campus of the University of
Miami, are “clean as a whis-
tle,” Dr. Gregory Bossart,
Seaquarium veteranarian
and curator, said on Tuesday.

Sebastian was rescued on .
Jan. 28 after several days of
cold weather left“ him weak
and suffering from shock and .
pneumonia. Bossart force-fed
the sea cow for two weeks
with a large tube inserted
into its stomach while inject-
ing daily doses of high-poten-
cy antibiotics.

The young male also over-
came severe anemia and
gained about 200 pounds by
eating 50 heads of lettuce dai-
1y.

Sirena, a younger female,
was rescued from the canal
on April 16 where rescue
workers found Sebastian. She
was weak, anemic and had a
systemic infection, Bossart
said.

The release is scheduled
~ for today at 11 am. in a shel-

tered bayfront area just south
of Coral Gables.

Meanwhile, Bossart said a
bottlenose dolphin freed from
a tangled fishing net between
Spar and Hibiscus Islands
last week, died on Monday.
The animal was suffering
from several chronic diseases
and was severely cut by nylon
cord.

 

 

 

 

The crocodile removed from the
beach last year had been liberated
by vandals from the now-defunct
Crandon Park Zoo four years earli-
er.

. The Wild Horse and Burro Advi-“l
sory Board proposed a five- -stage i

Pia i to kill
wild herses
draws fire

By The Associated Press

BOZEMAN, Ment. — A Montan-
an who has adopted 20 wild horses
is challenging President Reagan to
stop a plan to kill federally owned
wild horses that aren’t adopted by
the public.

Joey Deeg, who raises wild hors-
es as a hobby at a ranch ’north of
Bozeman, spoke out against the
Wild Horse and Burro Advisory
Board’s proposal to allow for the
killing of wild horses and burros
that are not adopted 90 days after
they are rounded up on public
lands

“President Reagan should de-
clare a moratorium on horse and
burro roundups until an indepen-
dent group is established to study
the honest impact of wild horses
and burros on public lands,” Deeg
said. ‘

Ranchers’ clout

Deeg said the advisory board
and the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment are putting ranching inter-
ests before those of wild horses.
Ranchers graze cattle on public
land for little cost, and many
ranchers complain the horses are
eating food that should rightfully
belong to the cattle, he said.

“The BLM has created this prob-
lem by rounding up too many wild
horses,” Deeg said. “The problem

is not too many horses. The prob- .

lem is too many ranchers.”

In the last three years, the BLM
has spent more than $50 million to

round up about 41,000 wild herses
and burros on public land, said
“Russell Gaspar, general counsel
for the American Horse Protection
Association in Washington, DC.

The horses have been rounded
up because federal officials want
. to maintain herds at certain levels.

“If the BLM would simply re-
serve a fair amount of forage for
the horses on public lands, we
wouldn’t have to contemplate de-
stroying a single horse,” Gaspar
said.

7,000 horses corraled

About 7,000 wild horses and bur-
ros are held in corrals because
they have not been adopted, ac-
cording to BLM figures.

 

 

: plan to deal with corraled wild
- horses and burros, Gaspar said.

Aside from killing them, other

alternatives were to adopt them

out, drop the fee for adopting
them, create private sanctuaries,
or have prisoners halter- break
them to make the horses more at-
tractive for adoption, he said.

John Moerhouse, chief of biologi-
cal resources for the BLM in Bil-
lings, said no one wants to see wild
horses killed, but that’s what will
happen unless more are adopted.

“We h0pe to be able to adopt out
as many horses as possible so that
we can avoid euthanasia,” he said.

The two methods proposed for
killing the horses would be lethal
injection or shooting them.

Better pickup spots urged ,
‘ Deeg suggested the BLM bring

to horses to a more convenient lo-
cation for adoptions, instead of
making potential owners pick them
up from ranges.

In April, 17 wild horses were '
adopted out of Deeg‘s ranch after

the BLM was unsuccessful in try-
ing to get rid of them at the Pryor
Mountain Wild Horse Range on the

 

 

Montana- -Wyoming border south of

Billings.

The animals were rounded up to
maintain the range’ 8 horse popula-
tion at a predetermined level. The
Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Range
was the first sanctuary set aside by
the federal government for wild
horses.

Most people don’t want to travel ,

to the wild horse range or to Rock

Springs, Wyo, to adopt horses, he
said.

The BLM will review public

comments before deciding what’

policies to set If the agency adopts
the plan to destroy the wild horses
and burros, the Horse Protection

Association will take legal action,
' Gaspar said. ..

Frank Church-River-of-No-Return

' But ranchers and some state

There are 24 Wolf subspecies in

‘ North America, ranging in weight '

- from ‘43 to 175 pounds, and often

Pioneering settlers killed off the
wolf to protect their livestock, of-
ten with devastating results. When
Montana placed a . bounty on
wolves, more than 80,000 of them
were poisoned, shot or dynamited
in their dens between 1883 and 1918.

But in the last five years, a few
wolves have crossed the border
from Canada and returned to Mon-

25,000 more in Canada and Alaska
and another 1,200 in Minnesota.

extensive comments It is expected
to be signed this summer, said Ga-

len Buterbaugh, regional director .

He estimates it will cast taxpayo
ers “somewhere between $250,000
and $750, 000” to catch, tag, radio-
tag and vaccinate wolves and rein-
troduce them into the parks in Wy-
oming and Idaho.

Although Buterbaugh said propo- .

nents see the plan as “a mandate
for everything to carried out im-
mediately. That is not true. It is
merely a guideline. ” And, he said,
it will be “a minimum of another
five years, at the very least” be-
fore wolves are loosed in Yellow-
stone.

10 breedingpairs

Planners want to establish 10
breedingpairs in each of the three

areas. This could mean bringing in V
. as many as 150 wolves, because

there is only one mating pair in
each five- to seven member wolf
pack.

Wool growers are petrified by
the prospect because wolves are
on the federal Endangered Species

designation makes it a federal of-

Using federal figures, Erickson

estimates ' “10 breeding pairs of

Wolves also eat moose, white-tail-

VALIER, Mont. - Instead of
shooting gray wolves when they
kill livestock, Uncle Sam wants
them trapped and transported
safely .back to the wilds. But that
chore isn’t easy, as Ken Wheeler,
one federal trapper is finding out.
After two wolves killed a cow
outside Glacier National Park
earlier this month, he set traps
for the animals, which are pro-
tected as an endangered species
and legally can’t be shot by
ranchers. But instead of catching
a wolf or two, Wheeler Caught a

Rancher Jim Hall, whose two
daughters saw wolves killing his

Of'Wheeler, Hall noted, “He
. caught a grizzly in the traps and
5 turned it loose right there on .my
' ce. Grizzlies come down into
the yard all the time.” .
Hall, who has lived on the Milk
River in the Blackfeet Reserva-
tion since 1935, said he is accus-
tomed to predators. “We see
wolves quite often. They come

around every two' or three '

months and stay for a couple of
weeks. And coyotes are thicker
than mice around here.” . '.
Trapper Wheeler’s Job is to kill
coyotes and mountain lions as
needed and capture, drug and re-

rmbve grizzlies or wolves when
they attack livestock He is one of
'15 federal trappers or animal
damage-control agents in Mon-
tana. He gets paid between
$17,000 and $20,000 a year and is
responsible for 15,625 square mi- ’
.les, or an area more than three
times the size of Connecticut.

His territory includes the east-
ern half of Glacier National Park,

, Wheeler, 45, a tall, quiet out-
doorsman who grew up in Mon-
tana roping cows and trapping
predators, uses a helicopter and

last March after they had cor-
nered some sheep.

He uses a tranquilizer gun to
quiet trapped grizzlies or wolves
before moving them to a shady
amt and arranging transporta-

on. ,

. “It is a good job -— I like it,”

says Wheeler, who remembers
catching the same grizzly,Mutton
Mary, three times. He knows it
was the same bear because every
animal he catches must be ear~
tagged and tattooed with a num-
ber on its upper lip.

Of the dead cow, he noted,

, _“This is my first confirmed wolf

; kill. I’ve been talking to a trapper

me some Minnesota wolf urine to
bait the trap.” (Wolves mark
' their territory more than any oth~
er animal and investigate new
scents, he said.)

IN A éEASIDE HEE-HAW HAVEN,
1,700 DONKEYS BRAY EACH DAY
FOR ELISABETH SVENDSEN

 




 




 

“We have dog and cat charities,” says
Svendsen, “but if a donkey is in trouble,
there are few places it can go.”

It’s a cool, gray morning on the Dev-
on coast in southwest England. As the
last mists lift off the hillside that holds
Slade Farm, the inhabitants, both an-
imal and human, start to go about
their day’s business. Suddenly the air
is rent with a sound that is a cross be-
tween an asthmatic bagpipe and a
rusty door hinge. It is picked up and
repeated, echoing off the hills. The
donkeys of Slade Farm are waking up.
Around 8 am. a short, blond-haired
woman walks into the barnyard. Soon
she is surrounded by donkeys, hun-
dreds of them. “Mother’s here,” she
announces happily.

In Elisabeth Svendsen’s world, the
donkey is king, and his suffering days
are over. Svendsen, 57, runs England’s
Donkey Sanctuary, on 818 acres of
rolling Devonshire countryside. There,
more than 1,700 donkeys graze or frol-
ic as the mood moves them, gazing at
the blue Atlantic, safe at last from
abuse and neglect.

Like many of the people who devote
themselves to lives of single-minded
sacrifice, Elisabeth Svendsen stum-
bled on her vocation. In 1968, she and
her husband, Neils, bought a hotel in
Devon from the proceeds of a dish—
washer that he had invented. They also
bought a donkey, Naughty Face, for
their children. After Naughty Face

86

gave birth to two foals—which could
have fetched as much as $500 each—
the Svendsens went into donkey
breeding as a sideline.

Then, in 1970, Elisabeth went to Exe—
ter on market day and saw seven
small, terrified donkeys crammed into
a tiny pen. As she was debating wheth-
er or not she could afford to buy
them, they were sold. They were the
last donkeys that Elisabeth Svendsen
would miss.

“I suddenly realized that I shouldn’t
be breeding donkeys, because there
were so many out there in trouble,”
says Svendsen, who began taking in

abused and cast-off donkeys. Among

the first she rescued was Lucky Lady,
a beach donkey she discovered being
beaten by its owner. After reasoning
failed, Svendsen warned him: “if you
strike her again, I’ll kill you.” Instead of
carrying out her threat, Svendsen
struck a deal with the owner and Lucky
Lady became hers for $95. Svendsen’s
inventory swelled unexpectedly when
the owner of Britain’s other donkey
sanctuary died in 1973 and left Svend-
sen 204 animals, as well as debts in
excess of $18,000.

Svendsen and her then-husband be—
gan to devote more and more of their
time and money to the rescue of don-
keys. They mortgaged the hotel and
bought Slade Farm, 146 acres of hills
sloping down to the Atlantic. They
fenced off fields and repaired barns to
accommodate their guests. Then they
got their first break. They received a
bequest for close to $14,000. It seems
the donor’s nickname had been Don-
key, and in his will, he decided to take
care of his namesakes.

Since then, Svendsen has depended
on donkey lovers’ largesse, and the
money has always come in. “Whenev—
er l’ve been so desperate or so short of
money that I didn’t know where to turn,
it’s almost like a prayer has been an-
swered. In the morning, there’s been
another check for 1,000 pounds. It just
happens every time.” With the money,
Svendsen has been able to hire a
staff of 92, including veterinarians,
nurses and a farrier (who clips the don-
keys’hoovesl

Donkeys are not the only guests who
receive special attention on Slade
Farm. It is also home to the Slade Cen-
tre, a day camp for handicapped chil-
dren, run by Svendsen’s sister, Pat

A 6-year-old handicapped boy greets a
friend. Donkeys, says Svendsen, “help
humans more than any other animal.”

Feather. Some 200 kids visit every
week, and one of their favorite activi—
ties is riding the donkeys. “As I love
donkeys, i also love children,” says
Svendsen. “If I ever get depressed, I
just walk across to the Slade Centre
and watch the children for half an
hour.” At the other end of the age
spectrum, Slade Farm occasionally
plays host to senior-citizen groups.

Seeking to protect ill-treated don-
keys outside Britain, Svendsen formed
the International Donkey Protection
Trust in 1985. On July 4, she will open
a sanctuary in Kenya, her first out—
side England.

Back in Devon, the donkeys keep ar-
riving, as many as seven a week. They
are housed in blue-and—white stalls,
most with a view of the ocean. Eventu-
ally, they are allowed out in the fields,
where they can pair up with a lifelong
friend. From then on, the two are treat—
ed as a couple—moved together, fed

together and, when one is sick, sent to
the hospital together.

If a good home opens up, Svendsen
is glad to send out a few donkeys. In
1973, three of her alumni were happily
lodged in a baron'al estate owned by
three elderly sisters. All went well for
several months, until one November
day when one of the sisters tele-
phoned and told Svendsen: “You’ll
have to take them home. They’ve be-
come naughty little donkeys. At our'
age we can’t be expected to push and
pull them up the stairs.” '

“Stairs?” asked a baffled Svendsen.

“Of course,” the woman replied. “We
can’t leave them out in the stables in
this cold weather We p’Ut them in the
guest room.” —Written by Michael Neill,

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - 5/15/87

’ Trumpeter swans

2 Of Kalamazoo

, New York Times

Detroit, Mich.

Biologists in Kalamazoo are
going .to great lengths these
days to bring back the trumpet-
er swan, a native bird that has

not been seen in Michigan this ’

century.

Recently, a Michigan biologist
boarded a flight from Kansas City
carrying a wooden box containing
three trumpeter swan eggs. The
eggs were swathed in Styrofoam to
avoid being jostled, kept warm with
a hot-water bottle that had to be
changed every hour, ventilated
with a tiny, battery-operated fan
and, at one point, were strapped
into the plane seat next to the biolo-
gist, Joe Johnson, of the Kellogg
Bird Sanctuary, near Kalamazoo.

“They were worse than ba- ,

'bies,” Johnson said.

The eggs were donated by the
Kansas Zoological Gardens in 'a
painstaking attempt to rebuild a
flock of trumpeters in Michigan.
Then a group of biologists hand-car-

ried the eggs to a marsh 40 miles,

north of Kalamazoo and slipped
them into the nest of a related bird,
the mute swan, in hope that the

foster mother would accept the

eggs as her own.

Marshlands across the Great
Lakes region were once filled with
trumpeter swans, whose mating call
sounds like a bad trumpet player,

but whose plumes were prized for-

feather quill pens. Hunters killed
the birds for their meat and feath-
ers and drove them farther west. By
the 18805, trumpeter swans had van-
ished from Michigan.

Now, there are only about 10,-
000 trumpeters in this country, most
of them in Alaska, experts say. The
trumpeters are greatly outnum-
bered by the mute swans, a Europe-
an bird that inspired the story of
g‘The Ugly Duckling.” The two birds
"are barely distinguishable in ap-
pearance except for their bills: the
_ trgmpeter swan has a black bill; the

--...—-—--n_..._._.~

mute swan has anorange one.

Because the trumpeter swans
are native to this continent, they get
along more easily with other water-
fowl than do the mute swans, which

' have been known to kill ducks and

geese. So preservationists here and

' in other states, including Wisconsin

and MiSsouri, are trying to rebuild
their flocks of trumpeters for his
torical and environmental reasons.

The biblogists have been espe-
cially cautious in their experiment.
Last year, a similar attempt failed
when four trumpeter cygnets
emerged from their shells but died
within a week. Biologists think the
birds were eaten by snapping tur-
tles that thrive in the marsh at the
Allegan State Game Area, where
the trumpeter eggs were hatched.
This time, the biologists trapped 400
snapping turtles there before the
eggs arrived.

The biologists planned the ex-
periment for months. They studied
the mute swans to find the right
foster parents. They timed the
pair’s breeding habits to make sure
they would still be nesting by the
time the trumpeter eggs arrived.
And they rushed the eggs to Michi-

' gan in time for them to spend the

last 10 days before hatching with
the foster mother.

“The timing is crucial,” said

Robert Hess, who is Nongame and

Endangered Species Coordinator

for the Michigan Department of,

Natural Resources. “Just a couple of
days before they hatch, they’ll be-
gin communicating with their par-
ents.”

The eggs were pampered in ev-
ery way. On a two-hour layover in
Detroit, on the trip from Kansas
City to Kalamazoo, Johnson made
frequent trips to the restroom for
more hot water to keep the eggs

from 95 to 100 degrees. Before ‘,

flight, he had to explain his special

cargo to curious airport security of— ‘
ficials “to keep them from being ‘

X-rayed,” he said. '

OMERVILLE - When Maude Brady
got home from a hearing before the
Somerville Housing Authority yes-
terday, her pet toy poodle, Tasha.
seemed to sense there was something
. wrong.
‘ As Tasha always does when her widow-
ed 64-year—old mistress is upset or sick. she
cuddled on Brady’s lap. bestowed wet kiss-
es on her cheek and walked around on her
" hind legs. as if to amuse her.
’ Brady was upset over the edict from the
’ Somerville Housing Authority that she el-
ther give up Tasha within 30 days or face
eviction from the apartment in the Mystic
Housing Project. which she has occupied
for 33 years. ,

The authority was acting under a Mass-
achusetts regulation implemented by the
Executive Office of Communities and Devel—
opment State Office that prohibits pets in
' state-subsidized housing. Congress recent-

.ly lifted a similar ban affecting family and
elderly housing that is federally subsidized.

William J. Casamento, executive direc-
tor of the Somerville Housing Authority,
‘ said in a telephone interview yesterday
that the authority "was holding individual
A hearings with project pet owners because
of the state law and in response to a prob~
. lem of roaming dogs and dog bites.’

He declined to say whether there was
any problem with Brady’s dog. Tasha
weighs 13 pounds. is friendly and barks
when she senses strangers outside Brady’s
door.

According to Casamento, residents in
state-subsidized housing who had owned
pets since before March 1, 1981. were al-
lowed to keep them. but pets acquired after
that day are required to leave. He said that
about 30 residents of the 456 units in the

Mystic Housing Project had acquired pets .

since 1981.

Got her as a puppy

Brady. who lives alone and Suffers from
angina. arthritis and an equilibrium disor-
der that sometimes affects her hearing,
said she had owned another poodle for 17
years while living in the same‘ apartment
while her two children were young. After

l'a. -'

that poodle died. her children, now mar- ‘

ried. gave her a puppy. Tasha. That was
more than three years ago.

Brady and Tasha have been constant

companions and there is an obvious bond
between them. “She lets me know when
someone’s at the door and barks at strang-
ers.” Brady said yesterday. ”When I’ve

been in the hospital and my children take

'her. she cries all the time and won't eat."

Tasha is also a favorite and protective of

. the six children who live in the apartment
' next door.

Brady added that she never hid either of

her 'two poodles from the housing author"

ity. “It was never an issue." she said.
“When we had our first poodle. we went
with some of the other residents with pets
and asked the authority if we could keep
them. and they let us.”

Brady said some of the best exercise she
gets is walking Tasha. who she says has

been spayed and has received all her immu-

nizations. “I always use a leash and clean
up after her’ she said.
Others upset. too

Some of the 30 other pet owners are also "

upset. One man with a large black dog
said. ”It's not fair." A regular visitor to the
project said. ”If they had any feelings.
they’d let these people keep their pets, espe-
cially if the pets are small and harmless.
it's been proven that the elderly and people
who live alone benefit health-wise from
having a pet,” the man said.

In a telephone interview yesterday. Pa-
tricia McDermott. a researcher with the
joint legislative Committee on Housing and
Urban DeVelopment. said the committee
was studying a bill. which would not be
completed until November.that would al-
low residents in state housing to keep pets.

“For seniors and handicapped persons.
pets are sometimes their only connection to
the outside world." McDermott said.

With the assistance of the Massachu- ,
setts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. McDermott said. a Model Pets

- Project was launched, with eight of the

state’ s 242 housing projects participating

Under it, pets are allOWed after owners
prove they can take care of them and the
MSPCA gives free veterinary care and su- -
pervision. “So far. we’ve had nothing but
success stories." she said.

McD'ermott said Brady still has two op-
tions. She can ask the local housing au-

, thority for a waiver from the communities

and development office. or she and other'
pet owners can ask the Somerville author-
ity to take part in the Model Pets Project.




IMAGE MAGAZINE - San Francisco Examiner — May 24, 1987

 

LOW PROFILE/BY STUART WASSERMAN

AVIAN ANGEL

WHEN BIRDS’ FEATHERS STICK TOGETHER,
ALICE BERKNER IS THERE WITH A REMEDY.

 

my ’ “'u‘vz‘fyr l « , _-
Berkner: “It is our oily mess. We are all responsible.”

 

 

he sea lanes that traverse the Bay Ar-

ea are much like freeways, with trafﬁc

regulations, peak hours of conges-

tion—and the occasional accident. In
1971, two oil tankers collided beneath the
Golden Gate Bridge; two-and-a-half years
ago, the oil tanker Puerto Rican was blown
apart by an explosion and spewed more than
a million gallons of oil into the ocean off
Half Moon Bay.

Alice Berkner, director of the Berkeley.
based International Bird Rescue Research
Center, particularly remembers the Puerto
Rican disaster. Coast Guard ofﬁcials at ﬁrst
thought they would be able to contain the
spill, but rough waters soon spread large
slicks of oil north and south of San Francis-
co, and these soon began to lap onshore. The
”‘ ﬁrst sea birds to become fouled in the mess'
were California murres and common loons.

' Within hours, Berkner got her arms wet
to the elbows, soaking and scrubbing oil-
drenched birds. “We worked for 30 days
straight, right through Thanksgiving,” she
recalls. “I remember the loons especially.
They are difﬁcult to work with because they
are so big and their beaks so sharp. You can
get nipped on the hands a lot.”

In the past sixteen years, Berkner has or-
ganized volunteers into round-the-clock res-

 

 

cue operations in dozens of places where
ecological disaster threatens—and with re-
markable success. Fifty-two percent of the
birds caught in the Puerto Rican accident
were saved, and that same year 68 percent
of the birds mired in an oil spill in Oregon
were released back into the environment. In
contrast, in 1971, in the accident under the
Golden Gate Bridge, only 3 percent of the
birds were saved; and in the nation’s worst
accident, off the coast of Santa Barbara in
1969, virtually none survived.

In the process, this unassuming woman
has developed a hefty reputation. William
Leek, a retired engineer from Chevron Oil
Company’s Health, Environment and Loss
Prevention Department, says, “Alice Berk-
ner is one of the foremost authorities in this
area of applied research. Many major oil
companies will call upon her in the event of
an oil spill in any part of the world.”

Berkner sits comfortably in her Berkeley
ofﬁce under twin four-foot-high posters of
pelicans, surrounded by other bird memora-
bilia, awards, a rubber duck and stuffed
ﬁle-folders ﬁlled with details of develop-
ments in avian research from around the
world. Her attire is the same when a crisis
hits or when it is quiet: blue jeans, a ﬂannel
shirt and a red bandana to keep her hair out

 

of her eyes.

Berkner, who is trained as an operating
room nurse, began bird work as a volunteer
in the 1971 Golden Gate accident. “A friend
of mine who is a veterinarian was going
down to help and he asked if I wanted to
come along. I was not doing any nursing
then and my two children were in school. I
thought I would go down for two weeks.”
With a smile she adds, “It’s been a long two
weeks.99.

What Berkner found was that there was
little organization among the volunteers and
little knowledge about how to handle birds
in captivity. Berkner adds: “Then there was
the emotionalism, which I found over-
whelming. My perspective is different. I
have seen people die . . . not that a bird’s
death leaves me untouched. But I have
learned that people respond to fatigue and
long hours in different ways; some get sulky,
others get emotional. They are not used to
seeing birds die. They consider each bird as
an individual instead of as part of a ﬂock.

“I was trained to function in a crisis. I
thought I could stay and try to add some
sense of organization and develop data that
could help the next time something hap-
ﬁned.”

Why attempt to save the birds at all?
Berkner answers with a question of her own:
“Why save 300 coots when there are ﬁve
million—does that make sense? Should we
save the whooping crane? There are only 60
of them left.” She pauses a moment, then
says: “What we are doing here is developing
techniques that can be applied to all birds,
even endangered species when they are in
trouble. ” '

With measured pauses, Berkner de-
scribes what happens to birds trapped in an
oil spill. The smile that usually graces her
face disappears. “The oil destroys the birds’
feather microstructure, which provides insu-
lation and waterprooﬁng as good as a polar
bear’s in snow. When the bird is wet it loses
body heat and begins to use up its fat
supplies to keep warm—it begins to metab-
olize its muscle tissue as it works to main-
tain body temperature. Then the bird stops
feeding, continuing to use up its fat, which
dramatically lowers its temperature, leading
to its eventual death.”

In the early days, according to Berkner,
volunteers ﬁrst coated the oily birds with a
light mineral oil to dilute the heavier fuel oil
and then spread corn meal on the birds’

 

 

 

 




 

 

feathers to try to absorb the excess oil.
Many died from the physical handling.
“Back then,” Berkner jokes, “I thought the
next logical step would be to put the birds in
the oven and cook ’em.”

But through experimentation Berkner
f discovered a household product that was su-
perior to the old process: Dawn dishwashing
detergent. “I don’t want to sound like an ad-
vertisement,” Berkner says, “but Dawn re-
moves all the commonly encountered oil
from the feathers. It’s effective in low con-
centrations and it rinses out of the feathers
rapidly. In many instances we release the
birds the same day or one or two days later.”

When Berkner is not handling emergen-
cies, she is involved in research, writing and
data collection. Last year she wrote a manu-
al for rehabilitative workers and veterinari-
ans called Saving Oiled S eabirds Or SOS.

Over the years Berkner says she has
watched the once bitter confrontations be-
tween oil companies and environmentalists
evolve slowly toward cooperation. Part of
her funding now comes from the oil indus-
try. Chevron gave the center $15,000 last
year, and she has received contributions
from Mobil and Arco. She is pragmatic
about the work she does: “It is all our oily
mess. We are all responsible because in the
end we are all consumers. You don’t realize
how many products come from oil: all forms
of plastics, synthetic materials and medicine
come from petrochemicals. And as far as
accidents go, who has never had an acci-
dent? That’s part of the fallability of being
human.”

This year, the Berkeley center celebrates
its sixteenth anniversary. Yet many people
have never heard of the center, and much of
Berkner’s work goes unnoticed. “We’re like
a firehouse,” she says. “No one pays atten-
tion. Then when a crisis hits—where are
you?” El

JIumans have no business

ireeding with non-humans

As offbeat as the event may have been, it
tands as a warning. ~ '

Some scientists are reported to have Created
embryo from a human father and chimpan-
mother.

r Brunetto Chiarelli, dean of anthropology at
Florence University in Italy, said his genetic
researchers had mixed the genes of apes. He
paid secret experiments elsewhere, perhaps in

' the United States, had made a human-Chimp

pmbryo, but were stopped because of ethical
problems. Ethical problems indeed.

§ .prdinarily the most productive attitude is:
Don’t hold baCk science, or you could miss
benefits. But the human race is dangerous
enough without the power to break down the
genetic walls nature put up to prevent the
interbreeding of certain species. Nature can be
tamed; that’s how diseases are fought and bet-
ter crops are grown. But nature also Can be
screwed up in a bad way.

_CritiCs of the Cross-breeding may sound a

little—hysterical when they warn of Creating

humanoids who would be handy as slave la-
borers. But is the fear so absurd? Humans have

‘g'ﬁhot been above messing up their own bodies

 

‘ ' he human race is danger—
ous enough without the power
to break down the genetic

walls nature put up to prevent the in-
terbreeding of certain species.’

 

 

 

with Chemicals for some stupid advantage,

Humans arenot above exploiting their own
pure kind.

Genetic-tinkering fears erupted recently in
the controversy over the patenting of new life
forms. The big Concern in that case was that
genetically altered or mixed forms of life
might throw eCological systems out of whack,
as. when new bacteria are introduced to the
environment.

As sclenCe makes its advances in altering
animals and plants. new ethiCal lines Can be
drawn. But on the question of mixing human
and other animal forms, the line ought to be
drawn now with a flat prohibition.

Lab reported trying man-ap
Coloradans say breeding apeman slaves unethical ’ w

3 By the Chicago Tribune
ROME -- The image of the mad
scientist with the white beard con-
cocting an apeman in his laborato-
ry is reported no longer a science
fiction table but a 1987 possibility.
An Italian anthropologist said
this week that biogenetic scien—
tists, using refined techniques of

artificial fertilization, are capable .

of creating a new breed of slave,

an anthropoid with a chimpanzee

mother and a human father. .
Brunetto Chiarelli, dean of an-
thropolgy at Florence University,
said the experiments on the new
subhuman species were interrupt-

. ed at the embryo stage because of g

. “ethical problems.”

The professor said the experi- -

ments have been kept a secret. He
did not know the name of the labo-
ratories but thinks that in the Unit-
ed States and other countries the
cross-breeding of a female chim-
panzee, fertilized with human male

. sperm, has resulted in the forma-
tion of an anthropoid embryo.

“Scientific information is nu-
merous but reserved. Maybe at the -

end of the year we will have an
idea of what has been achieved,”
he said. '.

.In an interview, Chiarelli sug-
gested the new species could be
used “for labor chores that are re-
petitive and disagreeable . . . or as
a reservoir for transplant organs.”

g The professor also said that, at

. Florence University, genetic re-
searchers have successfully
crossed two species of ape, gibbon
and siamang. “These two species
are genetically more diverse than
man and ape,” Chiarelli added.

Denver Post Medicine/Science Writer
Several Colorado experts cast

doubt on reports in Italy of secret
bio-genetic laboratory efforts
aimed at creating a new subhu-
man species by artificially cross-
. breeding human beings and chim-
panzees.

According to Dr. George Sei-
del, Colorado State University

physiologist, the seemingly close -

genetic similarity between hu-
mans and chimps is still far from
sufficient to allow anything ap-
- proaching successful cross-breed-
,ingw ‘ ‘ >
He said the challenge is far
more difficult than crossbreed
ing horses and donkeys to pro-
duce mules, for example.

“It would really require some
tricks,” he said. “You might be
able to start the process, but it
wouldn’t go very far beyond pre-
liminary cell division.”

. “This is the kind of thing that
' geneticists sit around at night
talking about,” laughed Dr. J .J.

Cohen, microbiologist at the Uni-
versity of Colorado Health
Sciences Center. “But I’d guess
this is a non-story in that no one is
doing it.” ~ ,

Sources in Colorado stopped
short of calling the story a hoax,
but they expressed grave doubts
it could possibly be true because
of the combination of technical
and ethical problems: '

“It’s endlessly fascinating to
speculate about this because the
genetic similarity of homo sapi-
ens and chimps is very close -
they are 98 percent identical in
genetic makeup,” said Cohen.
“But there’s simply nowhere in
the world where this would be
ethical.” '

Seidel allowed that inter-spe— _,

cies experimentation to study fer-
tilization at the micro-biological
level might be morally accept—
able. “But most people, including
myself, would say if you’re ac-
tively seeking offspring, it’s
clearly unethical." . /
Dr. Frank Marsh, CU professor
of medical ethics, said such ex-

‘this work ever being done by le-

perimentation undoubtedly would ,
be prohibited by research review
boards at any legitimate institu-
tion worldwide. But he said pri-
vate labs, unfettered by public
controls, might undertake inter-
ies work. '
“This would then raise enor-
mous philosophical and theologio
cal questions challenging the very .,
notion of What it means to be hu-
man: Is there an ‘essence’ that. '
makes us human? What will be
the status of this creature in our
moral community? Will it eve
belong?” . 3 ‘
Equally important, he said, is I
the possibility such interospecies
experimentation might “pollu ” "
human being’s genetic makeup.
“The idea of using money for this .
type of research when there’s so
much suffering in our own ‘spe-
cies’ is wrong, as well.” . '
Said Seidel, “I haven’t heard of .

gitimate scientists - or illegiti-
mate scientists -- anywhere. I .
think it approaches the impossi-
ble.” -

 

 

have their vital organs cut out for
transplants came as a. shock to the
clergy and scientists.

Though Italian scientists agree

’ that it is technically possible, they

doubt that such experiments have
been carried to their natural con-
clusion: the birth of an apeman ba-
by- .

. Church leaders recalled that the

' Vatican only a few weeks ago con-

demned genetic experimentation.
“The idea is bestial and repug-

nan ,” commented Rita Levi Mon-'

talcini, winner of the 1986 Nobel
Prize for Physics.

“Any such initiative must be
blocked at once,” said Professor
Arturo Falaschi, director of the
Genetic Institute at Pavia Univer-
sr y. -

. But other Italian scientists
agreed that with modern tech-
niques, the idea is feasible. They
also pointed out that the first ape-
man experiments were carried out

in Paris in the mid-19303 with what
one professor called “the most-
crude methods.” '

“As far as I know, nothing has
been published on the subject, al-
though one cannot exclude that
some experiments have not been
made, public,” said Alberto Piazza, '
director of the Institute of Genet-
ics at Turin University.

He added, “I ask myself, howev-
er, what would be the scape of-
such experiments? To create an
army of slaves?” i

 

 




 

DENVER POST - May 17, 1987

Utahanis trade: Tracking lions for hunters . "

By The Associated Press

NEW HARMONY, Utah— The
tools of Charley Leeder’s trade are
the pack mule, the well-bred dog,
the riﬂe and the quarry that his ur-
ban clients could not hope to find
without him. .
, Leeder makes his living from
' the stuff of other men’s dreams.
He' tracks the North American
mountain lion, or cougar, through
. hundreds of miles of mountainous
and parched terrain in some of
America’s last wild lands for the
benefit of hunters .from Japan to
New Jersey.

The big cat’s shrinking territory

in southern Utah surrounds the ar-
' ea of Zion and Arches national
parks, a 3,000-square-mile area
where cougars can be hunted
~ year-round because of the damage
they do to livestock. The license
for out-of-state residents is $250.

For a hefty fee he wouldn’t dis-
close, Leeder and partner, Karen

- Lacount, give clients a chance at a

lion with a high-powered riﬂe, pis-
tol or how, usually in the first four
or five days of a hunt. .

- “We have a lot of people who get
. their lion the first day and proba-
’ bly think there’s nothing to it,” he

says. “What they don’t realize is"

that we’ve been out hustling to lo-
cate the lion several days, some-
times a week before they arrive.”
Leeder knows his trade, having
run his hunter’s camp for more

than six years. He has bagged
more than 500 mountain lions in the
shadows of Zion in his 20 years as a
tracker, 13 of them in the employ
of the state, and got to know the
cats on a “first-name basis.”
Leeder can recall a time when
his crossbred hounds sniffed lion

tracks nearly every 300 yards west

of New Harmony, a time when the
lions had nearly decimated the
deer population and were taking a
toll on sheep herds. But that isn’t
the case today.

“It’s almost impossible to find

» the North American mountain lion

now unless you know what you’re
doing,” said Leeder, who has led
more than 300 hunters to their
prey, sending about 95 percent
home with cougar or bear skins or
a deer~head trophy. They bag be-
tween 30 and 40 cougars a year.
Leeder books his clients a year
in advance for 10-day hunting ex-
cursions. He feeds and houses
them in a furnished cabin or in one
of two mobile trailers he calls
camps. He schedules two or three

, hunters twice a month year-round.
Leeder and Lacount often lead . ~

clients directly to tracks of a lion
they have stalked. The trail then is
resumed until the dogs overtake
the lion, forcing it to a cliff’sedge
or into a ponderosa pine. The dogs
keep the lion cornered or perched
on a limb by keeping up their tire-
less barking for several hours.

 

“Hunters ask me how long the
dogs will keep a lion in'a tree, but
there is no set time. They’ll stay
for hours, as long as it takes, be-
cause they know I’m busting my
butt to get to them,” Leeder said. ,

With his experience in tracking,
Leeder has a few tales to tell of
hunters whose dreams outstripped
their knowledge of the prey. He re-
members two Texans, weighing
215 and 150 pounds, who fancied the
lion as docile as a rodeo calf. ,

The two wanted to “heel” their
cougar as cowboys do calves, rop~
ing and tying its legs together.
When Leeder’s hounds cornered
the cat against a rock wall, the
smaller Texan finally lassoed the
lion’s neck, turning the animal into
a spitting and snarling fury.

“That boy turned all white and
isigiairly hyperventilated,” Leeder

Meantime, his bigger partner
maneuvered himself behind the li-

‘ on and grabbed its tail while it

made deadly lunges at the two
men. '

“They kept screaming, ‘What do
we do? How do we heel it?’ I
couldn’t stop laughing because
there wasn’t any way I could see
that they were going to get that li-
on heeled,” he said. .

Man and beast faced off in the
corner.

“They were at each other’s mer-
cy, suspended in that position, tug-
ging as hard as they could. Finally.
the lion ran out of air and the two
Texans let go at the same time and
ran for their lives,” he said.

One client wanted to kill his prey
with a Bowie knife. Leeder said he
would lead him to a cougar for free
just to see it, but it never happen-
ed. “The idea Was more wind than
anything,” Leeder said. “If he
would have gone through with it he
would have come home with one
arm a foot shorter than the other.”

Most of his confidence stems
from his 22 well-trained dogs,
worth $3,000 to $5,000 apiece, who
keep the deadly prey at bay. Leed-
er takes a fresh pack of between

six and eight dogs on a hunt each ..

day. They yelp and bark, straining
at their collars to be noticed while
Leeder chooses the day’s pack.

On the trail the dogs are all busi-
ness. They sniff in silence and only
bark when they find a scent. The
rest erupt into a mad chorus which

grows in volume as the scent gets .

stronger. -

The chase becomes so intense
that untrained dogs will follow a 1i-
on off 40-foot cliffs to their deaths.

The lion’s physique enables it to

fall as far as 90 feet from a‘tree or
cliff and land on the run, ;_ Leeder
said.

Development to displace“

horse quarantine ranch _--

 

By DAVID WALLACE
Staff Writer

SUNRISE :- Construction work for a
massrve building project has made July 31

the date for the last roundup at the J&W
Ranch. ' A '

J&W is a privately owned quarantine
ranch for 92 horses infected with equine in-
fection: anemia, commonly known as
swamp ever, and is the onl facilit of 'ts
kind in South Florida. y y l

The disease poses no threat to humans
but requires that horses be‘isolated from
healthyhorses for the rest of their lives.
OtherWise, they must be destroyed.

IIorse owners from throughout the state
bring infected horses to J&W where people
adopt them and pay $17 a month for food.

Some people ride the horses, others just.
feed and groom them as pets.

which could be destroyed if an appropriate
Quarantine area cannot be found.
The J&W ranch occupies roughly “130

;-acres at the northwest corner of West Sun-

rise Boulevard and Flamingo Road. That

site is part of a 1,225-acre shOpping center

and residential project planned by Ameri-

cFirst Development Corp., owner of the

" land west of Flamingo Road between the

'Sawgrass Expressway and Northwest
Eighth Street.

Throughout the planning process for the

project, no one raised the question of where
, to move the horses, said Vernon Pnest,
* AmeriFirst’s development coordinator.

. State regulations require isola-

disease, said state inspector Jim-
mie Cangemie. The disease is rare-
ly fatal to horses, he said, and is
compared to flu among humans.
Although the horse is normally
healthy, severe symptoms — such
as runny eyes, runny nose and high
temperature -can occur, he said.
“It is infectious and incurable,”
Cangemie said. “It’s passed mostly
by ticks, mosquitoes and horseflies.
Once I quarantine a horse, I keep
tabs on it until the owners know
what they’re going to do with it —
isolate it or destroy it. It’s just for
safety’s sake, but it’s a gamble.”
Cangemie said he fears the
horses will be moved individually if
another quarantine ranch is not
found. Putting the horses back into
circulation could spawn an out-
break of swamp fever, he said.

al NEW RICHMOND (AP) -— Owners
{Ohio village are organizing to fight a
[proposed ordinance, similar to one in
nearby Cincinnati, that would ban the
dogs from New Richmond.

The owners are threatening to go to
Loourt if the Clermont County village
adopts the ban. The owners plan a

Association. “We’re ‘ going to fight
this.” .

Her association April 16 filed a law-
suit seeking to reverse a pit bull ban
adopted in May 1986 by the Cincinnati

City Council. The association might

also sue New Richmond if it adopts
such an ordinance, said Mrs. Peterson.
“I’m sure the village of New Rich-

said Harold Kennedy, poliCe Chief, who

ly attacked and maimed people. One
minute they can be playful and the next

Mrs. Peterson objects, saying she has

who died after two pit bulldogs at-
tacked him last month in Dayton.

Eckman’s death prompted the Ohio
House to pass a bill making it a crime to
fail to control a vicious or harmful dog.

Mrs. Peterson has no qualms with
legislation against vicious dogs, as long
as pit bull terriers are not singled out.

As proposed, New Richmond’s ordi-

gnu-g?” For GRIT . '
EMEMBER your last fishing trip? You
decided to backpack to your favorite stream
1 for a few days of ﬁshing. After parking your
-- car at the trailhead, out jumped “Rover”,
your favorite pooch. He would keep you company.
As you hurried along the trail, you noticed that the
smile on .Rover’s face was almost as big as the smile
on your face. ‘

    
  
   

Soon your heart was pounding — your back and legs '

were sore. Rover romped along beside you, bubbling
with energy. Doesn’t seem quite fair, does it? Well, it
doesn’t have to be this way.

Whether your dog accompanies you on a ﬁshing,
camping or hunting trip, why not let him carry his own

p 9k? Dog backpacks are even handy for day hikes to '

a avorite picnic spot for a birding trip and for numer-
. ous outdoor activities. , '
Dog backpacks are available in sizes from small to
extra-large. The packs are durable and hold up rather
well considering that a dog sometimes rubs his pack

on rocks and bushes.

A dog can carry up to onethird of his own weight
when in top condition. To begin, strap the empty pack
on your dog. Let him-carry the empty pack around for
a day or so, then slowly increase the weight of his
pack. Let him get the feel of wearing a foreign object
on his back. He’ll probably accept it in no time at all.

Be sure to pack heavy items in the bottom of the
backpack with lightweight items placed on top of the
heavy ones. And be sure to carefully balance the
weight on each side of the pack.

ANOTHER plus to buying your dog a backpack is a
surprising one to some folks. A backpack is a terrific
boost to your dog’s self-esteem. He feels useful.

My Samoyed is always eager to please, but even
more so when he is wearing his backpack. Once the
pack is buckled, he stands at my side, ready for our
hike. The look on his face is strictly “business only”.
Now, he is ready for work.

A few simple suggestions will provide backpacking
happiness for you and your dog. First, always keep

The 180,000 Porcupine caribou herd is very important,
but so are the polar bears and musk oxen, the wolves and
foxes and the hundreds of species of birds and migratory
waterfowl. So are the people who depend on this Wildlife
for their subsistence. And so are the land, air and water
upon which all the life of this extremely fragile and speCial
place depend. You cannot just reduce, say, the caribou herd

‘ by 20 percent or 60 percent and expect everything else in
the ecosystem to remain stable. Even the Department of
the Interior admits that caribou and other species will be
displaced or diminished, perhaps by as much as 40 percent
or more. Over time, if enough insults are introduced to any
environment, and especially this one, it will collapse. .

.Which brings us to Prudhoe Bay. The oil industry, the
Reagan administration and now The Post seem_mesmer-
ized by the single fact that the tiny Central Arctic caribou
herd has grown in less than two decades of Prudhoe Bay
operations. It is true that caribou there have been able to
adapt. Bes'des having certain geographical advantages
that the Porcupine herd does not, the herd at Prudhoe has
benefited a great deal from the virtual elimination of the
wolf, the caribou’s main predator, due largely to develop-
ment pressures. To expand one species by extirpating
another is no great environmental achievement. , . ’

For all of the oil industry’s crowing about its .enViron-
mental record at Prudhoe Bay, serious questions and

concerns need to be answered. Prudhoe facilities produce
considerable air pollution, . . .

even criminal violations of law related to air emissions and
the spillage of toxic wastes, metals and chemicals. There
have been thousands of oil spills at Prudhoe with unknown 1;
cumulative impacts. Each of Prudhoe’s nearly 600 wells *
. processes more than 800,000 gallons of wastes annually, 3
and much of it is.spread over the tundra, sometimes in I
violation of applicable discharge standards. The effect of
this on water quality is unknown. There is no approved
facility for hazardous wastes. If we have learned anything
from our problems in the lower 48 states, it is that the
environmental consequences of even simple develop-

the implications of which are .31

ments, such as roads and fences, often take many decades

to manifest. By then it is often too late.

Eight years ago, even before this administration’s

dismal record on energy and the environment, The Post
told its readers: “’I‘ he argument might be a close one

the Southwest Foundation for Biomedical
Research in San Antonio, Texas, who for
the past few years has been grooming ba-
boons for the corporate life to ﬁnd clues
that might help people cope with the
stresses of the working world.

_ Baboon CEOs and workers are good
subjects for study, says Coelho, because
they live in a human sort of society—males
and females form alliances and hierar-
chies, and spend most of their time with
their feet on the ground (not in the trees).
Of course, baboons tend to eat a little more
sensibly than humans; in the wild they’re
big consumers of plants. But Coelho ﬁxed
that. He had them on a high-fat, high-cho-
lesterol, high-sodium diet—biscuits load-
ed with butter, salt, lard, and eggs.

He divided sixty baboons into ﬁve “of-
ﬁces” of six females and six males each,
and let them establish dominance hierar-
chies for two years. Thereafter, two of the

ofﬁces remained set, but the “personnel”
. in the other three were shuffled around.
Coelho would take the boss (the most
dominant baboon) and the lowliest worker
' from one group and put them in another.
There, amid suspicious and sometimes
hostile workers, the transferred baboons
would have to form new alliances and ﬁnd
places within an established hierarchy.
Then, just as they were getting comfort-
able, Coelho would shufﬂe things again.

Coelho believes that tension in human
ofﬁces comes mostly from the constant
uncertainty about who’s dominant and
who’s subordinate. “You may have a task
you have to perform in a ﬁnite amount of
time,” he says. “It may be stressful, but it
gets done, and it’s over. Far mOre pérva-
sive is your relation with co-workers. Say
you have to work every day with a person
you don’t like.” That’s stress.

Since stress is thought to be one of the ‘

things that lead to heart disease, Coelho

plans to study the baboon office workers’ '

hearts and arteries. (All sixty baboons
were killed at the end of the experiment
and their organs removed.) At the mo-
ment, though, he’s trying to sort out the
behavioral patterns he saw. For instance,
males and females reacted differently to
stress. Whereas males would just threaten

newcomers, females would often attack
them. One female became so irked by the

repeated changes in her office that she

fought regardless of the situation. “Prior

had to be taken out of the study for short
periods of rehabilitation. And she never
became normal again.”

Like their human counterparts, ba-
boons confronted with new fellow work-
ers were anxious to ensure that their old
alliances in the ofﬁce were still solid. Fe-
males would go through “afﬁliative
[friendly] behaviors”—ﬂattening their
ears and smacking their lips—especially
around other females with whom they had
allied themselves. Males cemented their
old coalitions with males. Beyond that,
says Coelho, some males—particularly
middle-ranking ones, who, by the way,
suffered the most stress—“copulated
with females more and spent more time
with them in order to extract themselves
from the confrontation in the cage.”

Who copes best? The baboon who <

makes friends and allies deals with stress
most effectively, whereas the loner runs
the biggest risk of disease. This, Coelho
points out, has nothing to do with who’s
dominant. (Dominance, he says, depends
on a number of things—not only the abili-
ty to make coalitions but on size and ﬁght-
ing skills as well.) Just as in the human
work place, says Coelho, “there are guys
[baboons] at the top who are good at mak-
ing alliances” and dealing with stress, and
“there are ones at the bottom who are good
at it too. No matter what their ranking,
they look healthy and happy. Their coats j
shine.” But those who try to go it alone see
no one as an ally and everyone as a poten-
tial threat. “Their coats,” says Coelho,
“are scruffy.”

Vaccinations

Cat owners in Marin County
may soon be required to vacci-
nate their 70,000 felines against
rabies and could be required to

license their pets.

County supervisors, who unani-

mously endorsed the cat vaccina-

tion program yesterday, are expec-
ted to forward an ordinance next
month to Marin’s 11 cities for adop-
tion as a countywide law.

State law says that dogs must
be vaccinated every two years
against rabies, but there is no re-
quirement that cats be innoculated
against the dread disease.

The supervisors also agreed
yesterday to consider a proposal
next month to become the first
county in California to require the
licensing of cats. ,

A spokeswoman for the Marin
Humane Society, which enforces
animal ordinances, said the agency
supports the vaccination and licens-
ing proposals. “We support any-
thing that enhances the protection
of animals and the community,” Ju-
dy Carroll said, adding that many
cat owners already have had their .
pets vaccinated. ,

E WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE
world’s smartest dog, but he
still liked going out for a walk
now and then. Part beagle,

part Bohemian, his name was Chris, and

as a child I would visit with his owners,

George and Marion Wood, in our War-

wick, Rhode Island, neighborhood. The

Woods had no children, so naturally Chris

received quite a bit of love and attention.

In 1953 some friends visited the Woods
and brought along their dog -— who could
count to eight by tapping his paw. Well,
according to Mr. Wood, Chris took great

interest in the trick. As a result, George
spent about 15 minutes a night for a week
teaching Chris the rudiments of simple
arithmetic. In time Chris proved to be an
uncommon canine; he could tap out an- '
swers to complex math problems. He even
managed to learn a numerical code for the
alphabet so he could spell.

Chris was tested by research specialists
from Du Pont Co. where George was em-

 

 

ployed as a chemist. They concocted com-
plicated problems that Chris solved much
faster than the scientists. When the dog
was queried, “How did you do it?” be
tapped out with his paw: Smart Dog.

It didn’t take too long for this incredible
dog to become a celebrity. In 1954 be ap-
peared on Garry Moore’s “I’ve Got a Se-
cret” —- his secret was “I can add and
spell.” But Chris had other talents ‘as well;
in 1957 a researcher from Duke Universi-
ty, sent by noted psychologist Dr. Rhine,
determined that Chris also had ESP.

That dog was able to tell people how
much money they had in their pockets,
help local police solve cases, locate lost
items, and accurately predict birth-
weights. Once, Chris even picked the win-
ners for the daily double at Narragansett
Park for a neighbor. But George kept his
dog’s ability as a handicapper a solemn
secret: “I wouldn’t want Chris to be dog-
napped by gamblers.”

On the lighter side, Chris was a little
more assertive than most pets. I remem-
ber he would tell George which clothes to
wear, and on one occasion he started
avoiding one of Mrs. Wood’s art students.
When Chris was asked why he was staying
clear, he tapped out: Shoes smell.

Although Mr. and Mrs. Wood could
have gotten rich on their dog’s talents, they
maintained a simple perspective. Any
money Chris earned was donated to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to

.‘Animals. After all, Chris was just a dog

that happened to be smart. And for me, he
was a dog I enjoyed taking for long walks.
Those walks ended on June 9, 1962,
when Chris died at the age of 14. I guess we
all knew it was coming; two years earlier
Chris predicted he would die on June 10,
1962. I still wonder if Chris made a mis-
take or a mistake on purpose to be kind —
to save us from what surely would have
been a sleepless night before the tenth.
Ed. Note} C hris, Warwick ’5 wonder dog,
was tested by researchers at Duke, the Uni-
versit y of Pittsburgh, and Brown. In one of
the tests, Chris gave so many correct an-
swers that the possibility of pure chance
was less than one in 2,000,000. El E3

 

 




 

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL- May 23,1987

New debate raised over monkeys

Keepers seek
$t0 end misery

$ By Robert Reinhold
, The New York Times News Service

 

 

COVINGTON, La. — Nearly six
years ago a national debate over
the treatmentof animals in med-
ical research was ignited when
the police in Silver Spring, Md.,
charged a laboratory director
with cruelty to animals. The dis-

abled monkeys they seized re- '

main housed in small cages,
caught in a protracted and emo-
, tional tug-of—war between scien-
tists and advocates of animal
rights.

Now their custodians here
have recommended that eight of
the 14 surviving monkeys be put
to death because the experi-
ments, in which the sensory
nerves to their arms and shoul-
ders were severed at the spinal
cord, left them beyond hope of
rehabilitation and resocializa-
tion.

“It’s the humane thing to do,”
said Dr. Peter J. Gerone, director
of the Delta Regional Primate
Research Center here.

But the recommendation has
stirred new outrage among ani-
mal rights advocates, who say
they are willing to care for the
monkeys at their own expense.

Last June the monkeys were
sent to the Delta unit, an arm of
the Tulane University Medical
Center. The National Institutes
of Health, which took custody of
the monkeys after they were
seized in 1981, said they had
been moved because the Delta

Center had bigger facilities and
more primate specialists.

But animal rights activists
have been infuriated because
they have been unable to see the
animals there.

Their main ally in Congress,
Rep. Robert C. Smith (R-N.H.),
has offered to buy the monkeys
himself.

The suggestion by Smith and

others that the animals be taken
to a private sanctuary has been
resisted by dozens of major
scientific organizations fearful
of setting a precedent that
would hamper the future use of
animals in biomedical research.

Thus opens a new chapter in
the saga of the Silver Spring
monkeys, a bitter drama that has

Congress, the Supreme Court,

Publicity over the case contrib- ‘
uted heavily to the revision of
the Animal Welfare Act in 1985,

tions to establish committees on

oming from a publisher of
paperback science-fiction, the story
about the creation of half ape-half

Coming from the dean of.
anthropology at a major Italian university, it is
a chilling testimonial for strict controls. on

According to Brunetto Chiarelli, biogenetic

subhuman species that could be used to do the
dull and dirty jobs no one else wants to do. Such
creatures also could serve as reservoirs for
transplant organs.

Chiarelli, an administrator at Florence
University, said he cannot identify the labs
where the genetic tinkering is taking place. But

he believes laboratories in the United States and 1
other'countries have produced anthropoid '
embryos by cross-breeding a female chimpanzee

. with human sperm. The experiments, he says,

were interrupted at the embryo stage because of
“ethical problems.”

What problems? There should be no doubt
that any such experiments, in the name of
scientific progress, should be considered the

‘ unethical antics of irresponsible, showboating

researchers.

A half-human ape? To do slave labor or be "
caged up until its heart or liver is needed? In a
brief but eloquent protest, Rita Levi Montalcini, .
winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize for physics,
called the idea “bestial and repugnant.”

Biogenetic geniuses should leave that story
line to the writers of weirdo science-fiction.

This dog c0uld teach real

Though jewelry designer Birdie
Wheeler was escorted by Bob Lamm to
Wednesday’s grand opening of the beauti-
ful Prisms nightclub, she made one thing
perfectly clear: She was lonely without her
usual elegant stud around.

“I don’t want people to think I’m ec-
centric, because I’m not,” she said. “But I
dress Chablis well enough for him to
come to a place like this.”

Indeed she does. Chablis, a whippet-
type dog, wears thousands of dollars of
gold jewelry and diamonds. If there’s just
the slightest nip in the air or the air condi-
tioning is a tad too cool, Birdie slips Cha-
blis into a black mink coat that matches
hers.

Needless to say, Chablis turns women _‘

on.

“I was walking him near the Galleria

not long ago when a woman stopped her

car in the middle of the street and came

over and asked me if she could hug him,”
Birdie recalled. “I said, ‘Sure, go ahead.’
“And then, when she got done with
that —- remember there were cars now all
stopped in the street — she said he was

just so beautiful and asked if I minded if 5
she kissed him. Before I could answer, '
she kissed him right on the mouth.” ’

An official with the city of Houston Avi-

another mixup involving a dog has oc-

curred at a city airport.
(You may recall that we reported ex-

at Intercontinental Airport in a cage la-

Be that as it may, the current dog story

claim area. After much discussion with"

airport policemen about What to do with
the dog, one airport policeman walked up
and said: “Hey, I know that dog He lives
in a neighborhood around here. ”

So the airport police took the dog to the
neighborhood. They even checked with a
gentleman sitting on a porch who said he ”'

recognized the dog.

While all this was going on, an airplane
passenger came back to the baggage
claim area and noticed her dog, Daisy,

was missing.

“I just took it out of the cage it ﬂew in
and left it here while I made a phone
call, ” she told a baggage handler before
she broke down in tears.

For the next five hours, several cars

carrying airport police scoured the ne1gh- ,

borhood. And the courageous coppers
yelled, “Daisy, Daisy, please come here,

Finally, Daisy’s owner rode with the N’
cops. When she tearfully screamed for "‘

“It Wasn’t a usual job for the airport
police, but they handled it with real pro-

of the dining room curtains? Well, his mas-

are doing, can help keep those endearing
memories alive even though Bowser has

‘ since passed on to doggie heaven.

" Put him by the ﬁreplace and that’s where
3he’ll stay. No more staining the carpet or
itracking mud into the kitchen. No more vet
ébills, pet food bills or fleas.

i That’s right, several Dallas taxidermists
fsay, more and more pet owners are looking
i into the possibility -— and cost -- of preserv-
i ing their departed buddies forever. But while
some taxidermists say they will tackle the
challenge of bringing pets back to a lifelike
state, others speak words of discouragement.

“Suppose a guy’s had this bird dog for 18

what that dog looked like, every expression.
There’s no way you can reoreate that. They’ll

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL - May 24, 1987

 

 

iSov1ets pull out of Whaling;

EgXperts Cite
fiscal reasons

By Bill Keller
The New York Times News Service

 

 

, MOSCOW —- The Soviet Union has an-
? nounced it is halting commercial
whaling.
_ The announcement, reported on Ra-
dio Moscow on Friday night, said the
. fleet’s flagship, based in Odessa, would
be converted to a fisheries ship..That
indicated the halt is to be permanent
and not temporary, as the Russians had
said previously.
Environmental groups say the Soviet
Union has the world’s largest catch of
whales, taking about half the World-

wide total killed each year into its
huge refrigerated factory ships in the
Antarctic.

A spokesman for the environmental
group Greenpeace said Yevgeny P. Ve-
likhov, vice president of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, informed them
of the ban.

“It’s very welcome news,” Peter Dyk-
stra, the Greenpeace spokesman, said.
“The bloc of whaling nations has
grown significantly smaller.”

Radio MoscoWsaid the decision was
made after consultations with scien-
tists and conservationists. Western ex-
perts said, however, that the Soviet
Union had strong economic incentives
as well.

For one thing, Soviet fishing in US.
territorial waters has been restricted
because of sanctions imposed in 1985
for Soviet whaling activities. Ending

1ndustry ,

whaling could open the way for lucra-
tive, expanded Soviet fishing rights.

In 1978, Congress enacted fishing
laws tied to International Whaling

. Commission rules. Congress specified
that if any nation was found to “dimin-
ish the effectiveness” of the commis-
sion, the amount of fish caught in
American waters by that country
would be halved. If violations contin-
ued, the nation would lose its alloca-
tion.

In 1985, the United States found the;
Soviet Union violated whaling com-,
mission rules and cut its allocation in! .
half. A year later, after determining
the Russians still were breaking regu-
lations, the United States barred Rus-
sian trawlers from catching any fish in
American waters.

The only fish taken from American
waters by the Soviet Union are caught

-.____. «w... ....—.—1

by American trawlers. Fish are pro-
vided for Russian processing under
joint venture agreements signed near-
ly a decade ago.

Environmentalists said the Odessa
whaling fleet was old and in poor con-
dition, and the dwindling whale popu-
lation did not bring enough profit to
justify refitting the flotilla

Dean Wilkinson, a Greenpeace lob-
byist in Washington, said the Soviet
Union caught an estimated 3,028
whales last year, and was believed to
have taken a similar number in the .
season just ended. The Soviet Union
sells most of its catch to the Japanese
for badly needed foreign currency.

Wilkinson said another economic
factor in the Soviet decision was the
threat of American sanctions against
Japan, thus choking off theonly Soviet
market for whale meat.

 

 

 




— a new $550,000 outdoor learning ‘
center approved by voters four
_ years ago -— would be built in Oak
.. Grove Park by this fall. But the
planning and zoning process has
taken longer than expected, said
Jim Wussow, coordinator of second

‘ ary Science programs for the school
district.

g Meanwhile, classes at the rapidly

bullfrog.

growing school already are spilling
over into the cafeteria and the gym.
The school had 2, 200 students this
school year, and 200 more students
are expected by September.

So the Space now occupied by a
maze of squawking birds in steel
cages, hissing lizards in glass aquar-
iums, and by a 4-foot- -long snapping
turtle called Baby Huey in a metal
tub will be converted to four class-
rooms with desks and blackboards
and the occasional ticking of a com-
puter printer. The rooms are
needed for economics classes.

, “They were in here just the
other day measuring,” Dunlap said.
“I’d Say we’d better get out by mid-
June or there‘s going to be all kind
of hammering and sawing around
the critters. ”

Dunlap said he needs temporary
space — about 4,000 square feet with
hot running water and air condi-
itioning —- until the new outdoor
‘- center is completed sometime next

i spr 1118
“And we ’re hoping we could get
it for free, ” he said.
Dunlap said a storefront in a
" shopping mall might work.

“The animals would be an auto-
‘ matic drawing card for businesses,”
he said. So far, however, he has not
contacted any mall managers.

The best place, he said, Would be

a freestanding building near a
school so that students and teachers
could have easy access. Dunlap,
whose only staff consists of volun-
teersand students, said the center
is not set up to handle walk-in traf-

‘ fic that would be found in a mail.
The only other place in the dis- -
Etrict available would be an old bus
’1 barn, but Dunlap said it would cost
{the district too much. money to
f adapt the building to accommodate
f the animals.

j About 5,000 children tour the
center each month. And Dunlap ad-
mits he is a bit worried about where
the animals will stay until the new
center is completed.

“We’re not picky and we’ll take

‘ just about any empty building right
now," he said. “And if someone
gives me something too big, they
won ’t have to worry about me ship-
ping in elephants.” 7 _ “we

Safety Of 200 criticized

Experts say design contributed to boy’s mauling by bears

associated Press

NEW YORK 4- "Experts said
Wednesday that modern zoodesign
probably could have prevented the
death of an 11-year-old boy who was
mauled by polar bears after he

sneaked into
their enclosure
after hours at
the - antiquated
Prospect

“This should

have never hap-
pened,” said Da-
-. vid Herbet, a cap-
Juan Perez . tive-wildlife spe-
Cialist for the Humane Society of
the United States. “Someone at the
Department of Parks should have
looked at this a little closer and
. should have seen the possibility 'of
'_ this happening”.
i Other experts echoed Herbet’s
concerns, saying the 200’s reliance

Park '

for animals allowed two youngsters
to enter the polar bears’ lair, where
Juan Perez of Brooklyn was killed
Tuesday night.

Police officers, responding to a

report of screams coming from the

Brooklyn zoo, found two polar bears
eating Juan’s dismembered re-
mains.

The officers spotted three sets of

'clothing inside the bear enclosure

and killed the animals with 20 shot-
gun rounds before searching the
pen for Juan’s companions. Author-
ities learned later that the other
two boys, ages 10 and 11, had fled
the zoo in terror.

The boys told investigators that
they entered the zoo after closing
Tuesday to swim in the seal pool,
but then decided to swim in the po-
lar bears’ moat on a dare, police
Capt. Michael Julian said.

They stripped their clothing, but
two boys lost their nerve, police of-
ficer Peter O’Donnell said. Juan

then threw everyone ’5 clothes into
the cage, and he and the 10-year-old
squeezed through the fence to get
them, O’Donnell sa1d '

The younger boy ran when the
bears emerged from their cave, but
one of the bears grabbed Juan.

Julian said 20 minutes elapsed
between the time that police
received the first call and the time
officers arrived and killed the
bears partly because the two re-
sponding officers did not know
where in the 200 to search for the
intruders.

Julian defended the decision to
shoot the bears, saying the officers
knew Juan was dead but thought
that other children might be
trapped.

“The cops had to decide whether
there was a human life in danger,"
he said. “The cops felt there was
pretty solid evidence that there
was. It was not a retaliation kill-
ing.” -

know if there was any hope of a reunion
between him and Siri. He told me that,
although he lives barely half a mile from
the 200, he has not seen Siri since 1982.
The zoo has totally ignored the book and
its publicity. In fact, the zoo has been
rather ”unneighborly" to him in letting
him know that his thoughts are not we]-
come there. Gucwa believes that he can
and is doing more for Siri on the outside
than he could at the 200. Furthermore, he
says it would be impossible for him to put
Siri through her zoo routine of circus-like
tricks or to use the electric bull-hook com-
mon to elephant trainers. He describes
the 200’s position on elephant art as ”em-
bodying a crippling limitation to 01'1r
understanding of animals" and adds that
”cage builders are not likely to explore the

inner life of an animal .” Their job, in fact,
achieves just the opposite: ."to keep the
lid on the inner life of animals and their
subjective mental experience."

Gucwa will soon exhibit Siri’ 5 work in
Syracuse, and he is planning a much
wider exhibition in the future. He has
often said that, although he was hired as
Siri's trainer, it was really she who became
his teacher. I asked him if he could pin-
point the single most important thing he
learned from her. He said that he had
always known that animals were
beautiful on the outside. Siri taught him
that they are beautiful on the inside as
well.

Deprived of liberty and the com-
panionship of other elephants, Siri
has now been denied artistic
freedom.

THE ANIMALS' AGENDA - June 1987

Beauty Through Elephant Eyes

To Whom‘lt May Concern

By David Gucwa and Iames Ehmann
269 pages; $14.95 cloth
WW. Norton, 1985

 

as groundskeeper and general hand
at the Burnet Park Zoo in Syracuse,
New York, little did he know that the
work he did there would send ripples of
excitement and consternation throughout
the zoological, animal behavior and
biological communities, as well as the art
world. And yet, when Gucwa was as-
signed to become the handler of a twelve-
year-old elephant named Siri, the stage
was set for a groundbreaking discovery
that would change forever the way
Gucwa, and many of the rest of us, think
about animals. _
Siri is a member of the species Elephas
maximus—a species endangered by
humans' lust for ivory and land. Siri's
relatives once roamed the earth in the
tens of millions. Now there are no more
than 35,000 in the entire world, and ex-
perts estimate that by the year 2000, none
will exist in the wild—and only those like
Siri, incarcerated in zoos, will exist at all.
When Gucwa met Siri, it was love at
first sight. Although he had no ex-
perience with animal training or handling
and although zoo experts often had to go
through a dozen prospective trainers to
find one that was right, Gucwa and Siri
took to each other immediately. As
Gucwa got to know Siri, he noticed that,
like many other elephants, she would
pick up pebbles or other hard objects with
her trunk and ”draw” on the floor of her
cage. But what made Gucwa curious
about this activity was not so much the
drawing itself, but the fact that she would
”scope out” her work. That is, she would
pause after a drawing, "finger" it with her
trunk, and pronounced it ”finished."
Gucwa began to believe that Siri was do-
ing more than ”doodling” on the floor—
a behavior zoo experts explain away by
saying that all elephants doodle in cap-
tivity because they’re bored. Gucwa saw
more than that in Siri's work and he
wanted to ponder it. But because of the
ephemeral nature of the drawings, often
obliterated from the cage floor by weather
or by scrubbing, he could neither savor
them nor show them to others.
So, Gucwa did the simplest and most

logical thing. He went out and bought Siri
paper and pencils. And, during lunch
hours and coffee breaks throughout the
winter of 1980-81, Gucwa sat with the pad
in his lap while Siri stood above him and
drew. Although he did not know it, ”Guc-
wa was on virgin ground in the field of
animal cognition.” Soon the drawings
numbered in the dozens and Gucwa
began to show zoo employees and of-
ficials Siri’s art.

Many of the people who saw Siri's
work were fascinated, moved, excited,
and tearful. So it came as a surprise to
Gucwa when zoo officials showed them-
selves less than pleased to have an
elephant ”artist" in their midst. In fact,
zoo director David Raboy did—and has
continued to do—everything in his power
to play down the significance of Siri's
work. When publicity about her art began
to get media attention, Raboy and the zoo
quickly disassociated themselves from
Gucwa’s effort. And, not long after,
through a variety of circumstances,
Gucwa found himself laid off.

 

But why? Why were zoo administrators
skeptical-even afraid—of publicity about
elephant art? Gucwa and James Ehmann,
science writer for the Syracuse Post Stan-
dard and co-author of To Whom It May
Concern, set out to do some investigating.
They showed Siri’s drawings to a variety
of experts, academics, and art critics, and,
not surpisingly, Siri’s work met with
favorable responses from the likes of
abstract expressionist Willem de Kooning,
musician Paul Winter, cognitive re-
searcher ]ohn Lilly, animal activist
Michael W. Fox, naturalist Marlin Perkins,
and others. Gradually, Gucwa and
Ehmann came to an unsettling conclu-
sion: elephant art is a threat to the entire
concept of zoos. Obviously, an institution
built on the idea that animals exist for our
benefit will be unlikely to acknowledge
an animal’s freedom of creative expres-
sion. But, Gucwa and Ehmann found,
the prejudice went even further than zoo
officialdom. Most humans still cling to the
idea that we are superior to animals and
the creation of ”art" has Often been
pointed to as a ”dividing line" between
Us and Them. If animals can create art,
then another of our speciesist tenants has
to come tumbling down. .

If Siri’s work has proved one thing, it
is that we must re—evaluate our definition
of art as something exclusively human.
According to leading experts’ definitions,
art must show development. Siri’s work
clearly progressed through several stages
of expertise. Art, critics say, must be done
with intent. Siri’s drawings were clearly
no accident, right down to the final mo-
ment when she judged them finished.
Art, we are told, must have balance and
rhythm. Siri’s pictures, even when done
two-to-a-page, were spaced and balanced
in reference to the page and to one
another. And art, experts say, must be
pleasing to the observer. Clearly, Siri's
work fits that criterion.

After I read this wonderful book and
looked at the drawings that it so
beautifully displays, 1 called the Burnet

- Park Zoo and asked about Siri. I was told

that she ”doesn’t draw anymore.” So I
went to visit her. She was standing in the
back corner of her enclosure moving her
head and trunk in the swaying motion
that must once have produced her pic-
tures. People filed by, eating their Burger
King refreshments, and gazed absently at
her. I longed for the days when Gucwa
was her handler—when she could draw

during coffee breaks and, through such

a simple and lyrical act, challenge the en-
tire speciesist framework of Western
culture. '

So I called David Gucwa. I wanted to

Tribune Staff Writer . Fortunately, some Spuds facts provided

TAMPA — This Spuds is for you by Stolberg have been verified through other

All you wild and drooling Spuds MacKen- sources.

zie fans shbuld know that the Lassie of the 5 , Last year, Spuds worked on the film
’80sis taking his tail-wagging nationwide "
tour to Adventure Island today at 2 p. m. to
judge bikini and tanning contests.

Then at 4 p.m., Spuds’ chauffeur will
take him and his Spudettes to Busch Gar-
dens’ Hospitality House to “answer ques-
tions, give advice and share with guests his
own formula for having fun.”

Granted, this isn’t the kind of promotion-
al gig Lassie would have taken- part in, but
then Spuds is no ordinary celebrity canine.

“Don’t call him a dog,” Spuds spokesman
Bill Stolberg sniffed from his office in St.
Louis. “He’ 5 a Party Animal. ” '

_ Everybody who has seen him bang the
drums and woo the women in Bud Light
commercials has heard the “Party Animal”
designation Robin Leach screams it in one
of the spots.

But who is the real Spuds, the dog — yes
we’ re saying the “D” word -- behind the
;_dark glasses and the snazzy beach duds?

From earlier reports, we know that
Spuds is a 47-pound spotted English bull ter-
rier from North Riverside, Ill.

Beyond that, his background remains a
mystery. Stolberg — obviously dipping
heavily into Spuds’ drinking bowl— insists
that Spuds is a Busch executive and that he
talks.

“It’s his own special language" of facial
expressions, Stolberg explained. “He’s here ‘
with me now, so if you have any questions
for Spuds, I can translate.”

‘ Sure.

We wondered if the Busch folks were
planning to breed Spuds.

“He doesn’t have a steady girlfriend, but

.’Whats that?” Stolberg said and then
paused, supposedly listening to someone be-
side him. “Spuds says it’s like that Beach
Boys song, ‘I Get Around.’ "’

Who are his trainers?

“He doesn’t have a trainer” Stolberg
said. “It’s just the opposite. People come to
him for training. ”

Who owns him?

“Owns him? That would be a civil rights
issue,” he said. “You can’t own anyone in
this country.”

We know that there were several Lassies
and a bunch of Benjis. How many Spudses
does Busch have on the payroll?

. “Theres only one Spuds MacKenzie. He’s , r . , __ - . .
one Of a kind”, he said' " Spuds MacKenzie checks out the action on the beach In a recent Bud Light

television commercial.

“Rented Lips,” written by and star-
ring Martin Mull. Although Spuds’
, sidekick in the movie, Dick Shawn,
died during the filming, release still
' is scheduled for the end of the year.
Spuds has been seen playing
percussion instruments, but there is
no proof that his drum work actual-
ly can be heard in “Spuds MacKen-
zie’s Original Party Songs,” a record
collection of classic oldies such as
, “Louie, Louie” and “Runaround
Sue,” produced by CBS records.
Since Spuds appeared in his first
[Bud Light commercial in ’83, he has
raked in quite a bit of money, not
only from the spots themselves but

also from the outside licensing con-'-

tracts they attracted.

In addition to Bud Light, Spuds
has collected 17 licensing agree-
' ments. His likeness appears on ev-
erything from mugs to giant plush
toys to watches. ‘ ‘

Spuds beer steins arrived at Bay
, area Tinderbox shops Wednesday,
but most of them were sold before
they were stocked. The stores have
had waiting lists for weeks.

Other places that carry Spuds’

Lproducts include Bay area Spencer

Gifts stores and Expressions at

Tampa Bay Center. Several major

' department stores also sell Spuds

stuff. ’

Macy's in New York even has a
Spuds boutique, devoted exclusively
to Spuds’ paraphernalia. To kick off
the new department in April, Ma-
cy’s invited Spuds for a personal ap-
pearance. The line of Spuds fans
stretched all the way down to Fifth
Avenue.

“It was fantastic,” Macy’s
spokeswoman Judy Cohen said. “It
was a huge turnout, literally hun-
dreds of people. Personally, I think
he’s adorable.”

That popularity does have a ,
darker side. Stolberg says the tab-

ioids have had a field day with
Spuds, alleging everything from ho-
mosexuality to an affair with mod-
el/actress Donna Rice. ' ,

“It’s not true,” Stolberg insisted.
“I think how that started -— now I’m

not saying Donna Rice started it — ‘

but sometimes, people want the
publicity, and they’ll say anything
for it.”

After pausing to listen to the
whispers of an unseen associate,
Stolberg returned to the line.

“He might have met her at a

'party,” Stolberg said. “But he

doesn’t remember.”

A Spuds MacKenzie spokes-
man insists that the original Bud
Light Party Animal loves to lap
up beer at every opportunity,
particularly at baseball games.

“Spudssays it (Bud Light) is
an essential, party ingredient,”
Bill Stolberg said. ,

But animal experts say that

filling a dog’s bowl with brew is

cruel and can lead to serious
health pr0blems.

“We certainly find this objec—

tionable,” said Phyllis Wright,
vice president of the companion
animals division of the Humane
Society in Washington, DC. “It’s
the stupidity of man to give his
bad habits to dogs. There’s no
good reason to do this."
‘ Beer can hurt dogs because
of its high sugar content as well
as because of its alcohol content,
experts say.

Animal rights people
criticize Spuds’ habits

And even if Stolberg is kid-
ding about Spuds‘ drinking Bud
Light, animal rights people said
he’s setting a poor example.

“It tells people that it’s all '
right to induce pit bull-type dogs
to drink beer,” Clearwater Hu-
mane Society community rela-
tions director Ben Noreikis said.
“The fact is that it’s not.”

Stolberg’s response is that,
Spuds likes to “party often, but‘
party cool. He’s for moderation.
He always stays cool,” he said.
“The ‘Party Animal’ suggests
craziness and wild parties, but
it’s really a misnomer. His idea
of a fun party is good friends and
good conversation.”

Besides, Stolberg insisted,
Spuds isn’t a dog. He’s the senior
party consultant for Bud Light.

Wright isn’t biting.

“Until the dog can tell me
himself that he’s other than the
canine breed, I’ll have to believe
he’s a dog,” she said.

 

 

 




DALLAS MORNING NEWS - May 13, 1987

Cockfight fans assail Texas bill .

By Terrence Stutz

Austin Bureau of The News

AUSTIN Hundreds of
gamecock enthusiasts from across
the state marched onto the floor of
the Texas Senate Tuesday to de-
nounce legislation by a Dallas sena-
tor that would make it illegal to
watch or help stage a cockfight in
Texas.

While the Humane Society of
Texas called for an end to the
“cruel tradition” of cockfighting,
supporters of the sport told several
state senators they should forget
about“‘chickens’ rights” and con-
centrate on other issues.

“We have starving children in
this country,” said Tim Frantzen of
San Antonio. “We have too many
problems in this country to worry
about chickens’ rights.”

, San . Antonio dentist Roy
Valenda, who raises gamecocks,
said there is more violence on a
football field than at a cockfight.

And he observed, “A gamecock
« and ahound dog has never taught a

 

i .

boy a bad habit.”

The, testimony came during a
hearing by the Senate Criminal Jus-
tice Committee on a bill by Sen.
John Leedom, R-Dallas, that would
make it illegal to help stage or be a
spectator at a cockfight in Texas. It
is already against the law for, a
gamecock ‘owner to let his animal
fight. . p

The hearing was supposed to be
held in a small Senate meeting
room. But it was moved to the Sen-
ate, chamber when more than 250
people — most of them opponents of
the measure — showed up in the
Capitol. The committee took no ac-
tion on the bill.

Leedom’s bill was filed at the re-
quest o'f the Texas Office of the
Humane Society of the United
States.

Bill Meade, regional director of
the office, told the committee that
the current law is too weak and has
virtually no effect on the thousands
of cockfights that go on around the
state every year.

Robert Leach of Flint, president
of the United [Gamefowl Breeders
Association of Texas, said Leedom’s
bill would cripple the state’s “mul-
timillion-dollar enterprise in the
raising and selling of gamecocks.”

Leedom said it is clear from talk-
ing to law, enforcement officials
that a tougher law is needed to our-
tail cockfights. “The issue is: Should
we condone an activity that’s al-
ready illegal under state and fed-
eral law?” he said.

Under Leedom’s bill, a spectator
at a cockfight would be guilty of a
Class C misdemeanor, punishable
by a fine of up to $200. People who
allow their property to be used for
cockfights would be guilty of a
Class A misdemeanor, punishable
by a jail term of up to one year and a
fine of up to $2,000.

Anyone convicted of a violation
of the law could have all of his
gamecocks and equipment confis-
cated by law enforcement authori-
ties. .

Groups square off ” in cockﬁghting debate

By Linda Fibich
. TIMES HERALD AUSTIN BUREAU

 

 

AUSTIN —— Roy Velinder, dentist and part-
time farmer, came to the Capitol from his Saint
Hedwig homestead Tuesday to share some Wis:
dom with the Legislature. Looking across a long
table in the Senate chamber, he made eye’con-
tact with the lawmaker from the big city.

“A gamecock or a hound dog never taught a
boy a bad habit,” Velinder told Sen. John Lee-
dom.

The subject was cockﬁghting. Leedom, R-Dal-
las, opposes it and is pushing a bill that would
let the state seize the birds and ﬁghting equip-
ment of anyone convicted of pitting one rooster
against another, activity that is illegal in Texas.

While the measure is supported by animal
rights groups, including the Humane Society of
the United States and the Texas Humane Infor—
mation Network, it has opponents, and several
hundred of them showed up for a hearing on the
question before the Senate Criminal Justice
Committee.

The bill’s proponents say it will put teeth in
animal cruelty laws.

“I’ve heard it argued that these chickens feel
no pain,” Toni De Stefano of Wichita Falls told
the committee. “Now, come on. I grew up on a
farm, and we had chickens. If one hurt his toe,
he limped. If one got peeked on the head, he

Post Reporter
A Houston Zoo official said

 

’ "Thursday additional guards will

be on duty at night to prevent
dogs from killing helpless animals
in the children’s section of the
zoo.

John Donaho, curator of the
Discovery section at the zoo in
Hermann Park, said two more
guards will be on duty after at
least three dogs killed 13 animals
valued at more than $10, 000.

Three to six guards were on
duty around the zoo and heard
dogs barking about 5:30 am
Wednesday, Donaho said. He
noted that dogs often bark 1n the
park and it could not be deter-
mined that they were in the 200.

“To have security to prevent
that sort of thing,” Donaho said,
“you have to have a person ev—
erywhere. We can’t afford it. lt’ 5
just not in the budget.”

Three dogs, including a pit bull
described as a “killing machine,"
penetrated gaps in a worn fence

- K, Tuesday and killed a gray kanga- ’

roo. six wallabies, two Patago—
nian cavies and one 4-horned
sheep The gaps in the fence have
been repaired, Donaho said.

A similar attack Monday night
killed three pygmy goats.

The three dogs were captured
at the zoo Wednesday. The pit
bull and a mixed-breed dog let
workers approach them to put a

Cl Editorial/Page 1 B

 

 

noose around their necks, Don?

aho said, but the other dog, de-
scribed as the leader of the pack,
was shot with a tranquilizer dart
and led officials on a chase before

being captured near Almeda

Road.

“They were not wild dogs,”
Donaho said. “They were tame.”

Dr. Robert Armstrong, chief of
the Bureau of Animal Regulation
and Care of the city’s animal con-
trol division, said the dogs will be
kept for three days and then will
be killed if they are not claimed

“These dogs kill for the fun of

it, " Armstrong said. “The little
wallabies and the kangaroo were
no match for the pit bull.”

(Left) Daily shows feature small or seldom—seen creatures, such as this baby sun bear. (Right) Ron Magill meets an Asiatic cobra eye to eye.

¢Who’s Who at: Metrozoo

The audience in the amphitheater at the
Miami Metrozoo gasps when Ron Magill
lifts the lid off a small basket and its con-
tents hiss out.

But Magill is ready, eager to greet the
small cobra that curls itself into a combat-
ready coil. The handler—not the snake—is
the tease in this case, drawing his face
eye to eye with the sliver of cobra head,
coaxing, testing. then drawing back
sharply as, provoked, the reptile ﬁnally
attempts to strike.

“This is kind of a combination zoo and
circus,” says Magill of the wildlife show. a
recent addition to the Metrozoo attrac—
tions. “There are no ﬂaming hoops but we
do show the animals in a way that people
can see them more closely

Close IS the word for the touching expe-
rience a handful of visitors get during each
performance. Selected on the basis of will-
ingness, they follow an animal handler out

of sight, returning some minutes later
holding an assigned portion of a 15-foot,
ISO-pound python named Stretch.

As the show goes on, you see a baby sun
bear, winningly sucking its holder‘s thumb.
and a bateleur eagle, its head swiveling in
owllike fashion to examine the audience.
Although the selection of animals may
change somewhat frbm day to day. Indi. a
small white Bengal tiger, often makes an
appearance. To the South Florida audi-
ence. she‘s a celebrity,”having received
much press due to medical problems at
birth. “Now. we like to show you how
she’s doing,“ says Jaye, her trainer.

The wildlife shows are one way this 200
lives out its promise to be “‘cageless.“ An-
other way becomes clear as you begin to
explore the exhibits, traveling by monorail
or on foot. Here, the animals roam free on
islands separated by moats. In fact, the
tallest fence is knee-high.

The 200 opened in 1981 and continues
to grow. Already, the Wings of Asia ex-
hibit, featuring tropical birds in a ll/z-acre
outdoor aviary, has attracted national at-
tention. So have the white tigers and their
13th-century Cambodian temple. There‘s
also the Malayan Village, with its tame.
approachable animals. The newest exhibits
ﬁll out the ever-expanding African Plains
territory with zebras, elephants, rhinos,
and colObus monkeys hosting guests at
grounds on the eastern side of the zoo.

 

Miami Metrozoo is in southwest Miami.
west of the Turnpike Extension exit of the
Florida Turnpike. It is open daily from 10
am. to 5:30 pm. (ticket booths close at 4
p.m.). Admission for" adults is $6: $3 for
children (free under age 6). For more in-
formation, write Miami Metrozoo, 12400

Off1c1als defend shooting bears
that maUled to death boy at zoo

:‘United Press International '

, NEW YORK - Animal lovers
7'- '~ Called from across the country to
‘Eﬁprotest the killing of. two polar
"bears that mauled to death an 11-
3» year old boy who ventured into

iutheir zoo pen in an “act of brava-v

do, ” officials said.
W But animal rights groups and
‘swity officials agreed Wednesday that
3'shooting the bears was a pr0per
4; .course of action and. the lesson of
lathe tragedy was that no matter how
cuddly the animals appear, “chil-
vvi-riren and bears do not mix. ”
“If you enter a bear’s cage
M«there’ s a good possibility you’ll die, ”
E .01ty Parks Commissioner Henry
’ Stern said outside the bears’ enclo-
‘ sure at Brooklyn’ 3 Prospect Park

 

200 “It was not rational. It was an

iact of bravado. ”

5:33;? Officials said the bears were

acting normally when they tried to
itprotect their lair Tuesday night. The
.i’iattack on Juan Perez did not end
é‘slmtii four- police officers fired 20

shotgun rounds at the 23-year-old
:animals, killing 1,200-pound Teddy
11nd 900-pound Lucy .. .

The shooting of the bears
sparked an avalanche of telephone
calls from animal lovers as far
away as California and Canada to
police, Mayor Ed Koch, the Parks
Department and the 200.

“It was a terrible, terrible trag-

' edy, both animal-wise and people-
wise,” said William Kapps of the
American Society for the Preven-

 

 

JUAN PEREZ: Youth killed by

’ bears at Brooklyn zoo.

tion of Cruelty to Animals, who esti-

" mated that his organization received

200 to 300 calls.

“Most of the calls seemed to in-
dicate that the police overreacted,”
Kapps said. “One man wanted to
lodge a complaint against the police
department for violating the polar
bears’ civil rights.”

When police arrived they found
Perez dead and feared two of his
companions also were inside the
compound.

“We cannot fault the police for
their response," Kapps said. “To
tranquilize this 1,200-pound animal,
even with the best of. marksmen
and the perfect shot, would have
taken at least 10 to 15 minutes.”

Police said Perez and his
friends, 10 and 11, climbed a fence
to enter the closed zoo, hoping to
swim in the seal pool. However,
once inside, one of the boys, whom
police declined to identify, issued a
dare to swim with the bears. ,.

“We stood in front of the cage
and we all took our pants off to go
swimming. Juan said the bears
were afraid of people, and besides
they wouldn’t go near the water,”
one of the boys, Tyree Modlin, told
the New York Daily News.

Police said Perez sc00ped up

the boys clothing and threw it into
the pen.

Modlin told the News that he
and Perez then climbed the fence.
Perez swam across the moat rim-
ming the compound and was picking
up the clothes when he was at-

_ thousand per box,”

 

tacked by the bears, Modlin told the "

newspaper.

“He never screamed, but I could
see blood on Juan’s leg, by his foot,
and the white [male] one was biting

at his legs,” Modlin said. “It looked ‘
like the brown [female] one was

trying to yank his arm off. ”
Modlin told the News that Pepi

ez ’8 last words were: “Go get help

..'they re biting me hard. ”

:How Many Calorles
in a Cricket?

In the middle of the night, a
cricket chirps. Ampliﬁed by the
hardwood ﬂoor, the sound reso-
nates like a dentist’s drill in your
head. So you get up, slide the
dresser away from the wall, and
squash the little sleep-breaker
with a Kleenex.

But that’s not what a Titi
monkey would do. A Titi would
eat the cricket. 'In fact, so fond
are Titi monkeys of crickets—an
appetite the monkeys share with
cone-headed lizards, poison
arrow frogs, and soft-billed
birds—that the Dallas Zoo is
spending almost $13,000 this
year to keep them all happily
in crickets.

Zeigler Cricket Diet.”

For the novice, Zeigler Crick—
et Diet is the Purina Dog Chow
for crickets. It seems that the
standard-issue cricket is not
nutritionally .complete. The
Zeigler Diet adds calcium, pro-
ducing a cricket that can serve as
a sole food for 200 creatures.

Fluker’s Cricket Farm in Port
Allen, Louisiana, won the 200’s
198’7 cricket contract. “We raise
Acheta domesticus, which is the
house cricket,” says David Fluk-
er, son of Richard Fluker, who
started cricket farming in 1960.
“They’re not even close to the
crickets in the wild.”

The Flukers have ten employ—
ees who feed their crickets corn
meal and lots of water. And
David Fluker is proud that his
crickets are good zoo food. “A
cricket is 60 percent protein, 35
percent fat, and 5 percent car-
bohydrate,” he says.

And how many calories are in
a cricket? “That’s really off the
wall,” says Raphael. “I don’t
know. If I had to guess, I’d say
maybe one calorie per small
cricket. So ten crickets equal
one saltine cracker.” ——J.P.

strange because I thought they
only had dogs and cats.

Then all of a sudden I saw a tiny.

Arctic Refuge:S
_ Please Don ’t Disturb

; The Post’s editorial “Caribou

vs. Motorist” [April 23] was sur-
prisingly off the mark. The issue
is not as simplistic as the editors
would have us believe; it is the
preservation of a vital and incredi-
bly .wild ecosystem.

The effects of oil drilling on the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska—home of the last large
_ wild animal herd in our country——
are truly unknown. It is indeed a
bleak place, “but the bleakness holds
another value that is difficult to
appreciate in Washington: the in-
credible wildness. There is no-
where else in the United States
where one can hike for days with-
out ever noticing a trail or any sign
of human endeavor.

I was fortunate to hike for sev-
eral weeks from the Sheenjek
River watershed to the Arctic
Divide to the north. I noticed
dozens of arctic sheep, encouno
tered several small herds of cari-
bou and enjoyed the challenge of
hiking among unclimbed wild
mountains and fording glacier-
swollen rivers. However, the lin-
gering memory is the rhythm of
an incredibly untamed wilderness.
The challenge before us is not to
find a few more days’ oil or to drill
without disturbing a few caribou,
but ”to attempt to preserve a
, glimpse of that primeval conti-
nent our forefathers discovered.

WILLIAM N. ROM
Rockville
I

The Post advocated energy de-
velopment on the undisturbed
coastal plain of Alaska’s Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge: “Human
intrusion on the scale of oil explo-
ration always makes a difference
in a landscape. But . . . there is
hardly any other [place] where
drilling would have less impact on
surrounding life.”

Compare The Post editorial of
May 7, 1979, in the midst of our
last energy crisis, titled “Oil or
Caribou.” There the Arctic Ref-
uge was described as “inhabited
mainly by the last great herd of
healthy and undisturbed caribou
in the land, although the wilder-
ness is shared by many other
, members of the wild kingdom."

The Post further stated in the'
1979 editorial: “Once industrializa- .

tion and the caribou collide, what-

ever damage is dOne to the caribou?
and the fragile but beautiful land on 1

which they live will not be revers-

ible. So why tamper, with their '_

 

habitat until the day is nearer when
what lies under is needed and can
be wisely used?”

Today The Post—like Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel and the oil
lobby—claims “oil drilling seems to

be unlikely to be the dire threat’;

that conservationists claim.

1‘ This seems an odd conclusion

when the Department of Interior’s

; own wildlife biologists wrote in No-

‘ vember 1986, “Displacement [of
caribou] from historic calving
grounds in response to oil develop-
ment at Prudhoe Bay [60 miles
west] has been documented. . . .
With the inﬂux of workers and use
of the haul road for Prudhoe Bay
development, the wolf population
. . . decreased . . . because of hunt-
ing. At that time, [caribou] num-
bers began increasing." In other
words, development hurt the pred-

ators as well as the caribou. And ,,

the functioning ecosystem has been
severely damaged.

The oil industry has been given
access to all of arctic Alaska’s
1,100 miles of coastline, onshore
and off, except for this one small
but critical 100-mile area. Devel-
opment would obliteratethe wil-
derness and wildlife values just as
thoroughly as building a dam for
hydropower in the Grand Canyon
would obliterate the national
park. A lot of energy could be
developed at the Grand Canyon.
Would we be the better for it?

' TIM MAHONEY

Chairman. Alaska Coalition

Washington

- I

Like his predecessors in the
Reagan 'Interior Department,
Donald Hodel believes that his job
requires him to open public lands
for exploitation of nonrenewable
fossil fuels. Meanwhile, at the De-

partment of Energy, most federal ‘
* programs for conservation and 4

development of renewable energy 1‘
resources have been eliminated. a;

m
, "Qw-

_ Like most Americanst would"
like to see the United States attain
energy independence. But how is .
burning up the oil now stored in the
ground going to make us indepen-
dent of foreign supplies? The

' . Reagan appointees still have time

to shift from policies that encour-"
age consuming stored energy to
programs for developing energy
resources and reducing total ener-
gy use. The rest of us should offer
encouragement by blocking the
arctic oil drilling.

Miles the beagle
Your article regarding the use of Miles
the beagle as a test subject for Dr.
Paul Segall’s experiment was in fact
very chilling. What inspired your writer
to present this as a humorous event?
What’s so funny about an unfortunate
animal being subjected to this type of
operation? And why add to that bar-
baric act by placing the poor dog in a
bucket of ice just for the photograph?
We suggest as a follow-up you report
on Dr. Segall’s psychological profile.

Your “Hero” heading for the beagle
who was frozen to death after having
his blood drained would have better
been characterized as “Victim.” One
must question the ethics and morality
of such cruel and unnecessary animal
experimentationJ wonder how many

‘ helpless animals were killed before

this one, lone beagle survived this ab-
horrent laboratory experiment. If our
universities cannot inspire inter-
species respect, we are indeed in
deep trouble.

’ Butch the Terrier Credited With Saving Life of Owner’s Grandmother

By PATT MORRISON, Times Staff Writer _

He growls at his vet, he once bit the tail
off the family rabbit and he “wasn't No. l
in [obedience] class or anything," his
owner said. '

But Butch the Terrier is ‘ No. 1 with
Nellie Johnston, and on Wednesday, that
was the number that counted.

The 4-year-old dog, which weighs less
than a family-sized sack of kibble, saved
the 93-year-old widow from bleeding to
death last February after she suffered a
heart “episode" and struck her head as she

ell. '

And Wednesday, the Jack Russell terri-
er became the fifth and smallest dog to win
the Hero Dog Bruce Farrell Award for

gallantry, awarded by the Los Angeles

Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals and Pauline De Farrell, whose own

late, lamented dog Bruce, a Labrador?

Newfoundland mix, saved her life three
. times before he died of injuries suffered in
, the last incident.

aWard: a brass plaque, a $100 check and a
day's doting attention by animal lovers.
To all of that, Butch seemed indifferent,

‘- understandably; he doesn’t even get to
" keep the check. . A
“I think he's going to have to donate

some of it to the SPCA,” and to saving wild
horses slated to be shat on federal lands,
said his owner, Ann Lian, Johnston's
granddaughter.

' Lian was asleep in their Westwood home
one morning in February when Johnston

got up at 5:30 to make coffee as usual, ,

suffered a heart irregularity and fell to the
floor, where she lay unconscious in her
own blood.

For g or 25 minutes, while the other
dog—a German shepherd-slept, Butch
ran frantically “from room to room," said
Lian, “barking in our faces” in spite of
being severely shushed by Lian and her
sister, Leslie.

Finally, when the dog kept leaping

him out, “just like [in] ‘Lassie,’ ” and found
her grandmother. The doctor said that if
the dog had not alerted them, “it might not
have been in time.” '

Butch~has helped Johnston through her
recuperation, and 'on Wednesday she said
she felt “great” for both of them. She
stroked his muzzle and chucked him under
the chin. Butch licked her hand and then
squirmed away.

“He’s kind of a little terror at other
times," Lian said. “He’s not the hero all the
time.” But he is “smart and he's persis-
tent." Without his vigilance, Leslie Lian
said, they “would have let my grandmoth-
er lie in her own blood." a ' _

But, just as no man is a hero to‘his valet, .
no dog is completely a hero to its vet.

Dr. Janet Shulman was at SPCA’s head-
quarters to watch her patient's moment of
glory—the same patient that snarls when
those two make eye contact.

“Hi, Butch,” she said cheerily. “Are we

The Black Rhino.

Preserving Diversity

 

By HAROLD M. SCHMECK Jr.

 

HE genes of the black rhinoc-

eros are being analyzed at

Columbia University in a

project that may be crucial
to the survival of that endangered
species in Africa.

The wild populations of the huge

animals are disappearing rapidly,

from Africa, largely because of

poaching, and conservationists be--

lieve they may have to be relocated 1n
special sanctuaries tolsave them.

But concentrating" the rhinos in
sanctuaries involves a risk too, ac—
cording to Wildlife Conservation In-
ternational, a conservation and re-
search arm of the New York Zoologi-
cal Society that is sponsor of the
study. In time, too much concentra-
tion of different subspecies of the
rhinos may rob them of their genetic
diversity. And genetic diversity may
be vital to their long- -term survival by
offering the species survival advan-
tages in the face of disease and envi-

ronmental change.

That is why Dr. David Western, an
ecologist of the conservation group, is
collecting tissue and blood samples
from the wild animals and sending
them to the Columbia laboratory of
Dr. Don Melnick for analysis. Sam-
ples from animals in several Amer-

ican zoos are also to be being ana- .

lyzed in the study. .
Questions on Genetic Diversity

Wild black rhinos are found in a
wide range of habitats, from scat-
tered woodland to semi-desert and it
is possible that the local populations
may be genetically adapted to their
‘local climates. There are recognized
.1 subspecies of the black rhinos, but no
one really knows how much genetic

,diversity there is among them. That

is what the genetic studies seek to
determine.

If a subspecies represents a big
enough population and a sufficiently

distinct genetic endowment, it might

be worthwhile to keep it separate
from other groups to preserve its spe-
cial traits.

At the bear pits here, the bears

Hoessle said it was natural for
a bear to attack when another
creature encroached on its
territory.
“It is a predator,” Hoessie said '
“That is its pit and is where it
lives. Anything that comes in is a
threat . . . or something to eat,"

Hoessle said he didn’t want to
“talk about the possibilities" of
someone getting over the fence
and into the pit.

“If you talk about it in the:
newspaper, somebody will try'

do anything they want.”

When we heard how Ardell ~ ,
Mitchell keeps tabs on his hr-
four-legged friends, our firm
question was, “But does he
close the lid?”

Mitchell, supervisor of
reptiles at the Dallas Zoo, re- p
cently concluded a year-long
projeCt documenting the
identifying characteristics of .7 '
lizards. He made his records ﬁg,
the way many offices do —
using the common photo-
copy machine.

Picture this: Mitchell _, ,
takes a bucket of nine
newborn, blatched, blue-
tongued skinks into the 200’s
administrative offices. One
by one, he places the babies g.
on the machine, and ZAP ! In-
Stant identification records.

The photocopier pro-
duces a quick, handy record
of scale patterns, scale irreg-
ularities and color patterns.
Mitchell says the process pro-
vides the m05t practical
means of identifying many

easier and cheaper than doing some-
thing like tattooing or branding,”
Mitchell says.

Of course, net every 200 lizard has
been Xeroxed; the chameleons weren’t
cooperative. But the project was so suc-
cessful Mitchell has begun a similar one
for the turtles.

Vanishing Species

 

S eo Turtles:
Drowning in
Controversy

By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY,
Times Staff Writer

ABOARD THE RESEARCH
VESSEL LONGHORN—When the
ship was 15 miles out to sea, Tim
Fontaine ordered the tons of turtles
over the side.

Turtle handlers scurried for the
first of the cardboard boxes that
lined the deck. They cut the strap-
ping tape, pulled off the cover and
gingerly lifted the hard-shelled
cargo. One by one, they dropped
the turtles, each about the size of a
dinner plate, into the water.

Three hours later, 1,634 more
Kemp’s ridley sea turtles—the rar-
est of all turtles and one that is
becoming more scarce each
year—were swimming in the Gulf
of Mexico, and the Ldnghorn was
headed for its dock at Port Aransas,
Tex.

Fontaine, a biologist with the
National Marine Fisheries Service
in Galveston, Tex, was already
talking about the beer and cham-
pagne he would drink when he got
his land legs back. It had been a
busy night .because one of the
rental trucks used to transport the
ridleys from his lab to Port Aransas
had broken down.

Raised in Captivity

Now the turtles were all safely in
the water. It was the end of another
year of raising them from hatch-
lings to be released as yearlings-—
an attempt to save the species from
extinction. Even after 10 years,
success is still uncertain. Scientists
have not yet determined how old
the ridleys must be to mate, and so
far, no new nesting grounds have
been established on the Texas
coast.

Each year, Kemp's ridley num-
bers decline. One estimate is that
there may be only 600 egg-laying

females left in the world, down -

from the 40,000 that gathered in
'1947 on the Mexican beach that is
still their only nesting ground.

“If something isn’t done to save
these turtles, they’re going to dis-
appear from the face of the earth,”
Fontaine said. '

Few Natural Enemies

Kemp’s ridley sea turtles even- .

tually weigh between 40 and 60
pounds. They have few natural
enemies once they reach the size of
those dropped over the side of the
Longhorn, though sharks consider
them tasty fare.

Environmentalists contend that
the major threat to the ridley—in-
deed, to all sea turtles in American
waters—is the nets of some 17,000
shrimp boats that ply the Gulf of
Mexico and the southern Atlantic.
The green, leatherback and
hawksbill turtles are also endan-
gered species, and survival of the
loggerhead sea turtle is cons1dered
threatened.

Sea turtles have been around for
185 million years, but, in one
human generation, they have come
to the edge of extinction in Ameri-
can waters.

The National Marine Fisheries
Service’s estimate—fiercely con-
tested by the shrimping indus-
try—is that 47,970 sea turtles of all

{varieties are caught each year in

shrimp nets, and that more than
11,000 of them drown.

Environmentalists and govern-
ment experts say there is an an-
swer to the problem. It is a “turtle
excluder device” or TED, a piece of
equipment that can be sewn into
shrimping nets to allow turtles to
escape without releasing the
shrimp catch. Developed by the
federal government over the last
decade at a cost of $3.4 million, it is
due to be phased in as mandatory
equipment for shrimpers beginning
July 15.

But that will not happen if the
shrimpers have anything to say
about it. Saving the turtles is
shaping up as a classic battle
between the richest fishery in the
United States and environmental-
ists, backed by government regula-
tions, intent on putting preserva-
tion ahead of profit.

Figures Held Exaggerated

The shrimpers say the TED
doesn’t work—that they lose
shrimp and that the devices are

bulky and dangerous to have

aboard. Further, they say, the TED
is a government boondoggle and
the turtle-kill figures are wildly
exaggerated.

“We’re not the culprits making
these turtles disappear,” said Tee
John Mialjevich, president of Con-
cerned Shrimpers of Louisiana.
“They don’t have any actual fig-
ures on how many turtles we catch
in the gulf. I’ve caught six turtles

since 1965, and all six went back

into the wateni? , ”emu“- w-.- - ,

Mialjevich, e” "mot 4 and 327
fpounds, was adamant that neither
; he nor any other Louisiana shrimp—

? er will ever use a TED. He said the

burden of bringing back the
Kemp’s ridley should rest with
Fontaine’s turtle-stocking pro-
gram.

Hazard Denied

The environmentalists say that
although the shrimpers have been
dragging their feet for years, it is
only a matter of time until the
devices are in use—and that it will
be sooner rather than later. They
say that the equipment does work
and deny that it poses any hazard.
They defend. their turtle mortality
figures as based on scientific calcu—
lations. They say they are de-
termined that the sea turtles will be
protected, no matter what the cost
to the shrimping industry.

Shrimpers are not the worst
culprits in the near-extinction of
the Kemp’s ridley sea turtle, just
the latest. The species has only one
known nesting ground, a Mexican
gulf beach called Rancho Nuevo,

- The decimation of the turtles came

In 1968, the Mexican government
became alarmed at the dwindling
numbers of turtles returning to
Rancho Nuevo, and began station-
ing Soldiers on the beach during the
egg-laying season. Fontaine said
that the soldiers have orders to
shoot first and ask questions later if
they catch anyone poaching turtle
eggs.

“Those guys are the meanest—
looking people you’ve ever seen,”
he said.

In 1978, the National Marine
Fisheries Service began the pro—
gram to foster a second nesting
area in Texas. It entails digging up
2,000 eggs each year and transport-
ing them to Padre Island off the
Texas coast. There, the eggs are
hatched and the young turtles are
allowed to scurry from the sand to
the water. Then they are put in
boxes and carted off to Galveston
for a year of care in the lab. The
researchers’ theory is that once the
yearlings are taken to sea, they Will
remember where they were
hatched, as salmon do, and return
to the Texas beach at maturity to
lay eggs.

At about the time that program
was begun, biologists hegar: to
suspect that the population of all
sea turtles was dwindzing, and that '

7 the; decline was now due lrgely to

 




the number caught in shrimpers '

, nets. Work began to develop a
device to allow the turtles to escape
from the nets.

Exclude: Given Away

In 1981, the fisheries service
brought out the first working mod-
el of the TED. Besides making its
own tests, the service began giving
the devices to shrimpers, on the
perhaps naive theory that they
would become popular. The
shrimpers said they were too
heavy, so the service made a
lighter version. They said they

were too bulky, so they made them -

collapsible. The biggest complaint,
however, was that they just didn’t
work.

“All of our testing shows that it
does work," said Terry Henwood,
one of the developers of the TED.
“I've never seen any scientific test
of theirs that showed it reduced the
catch.”

As the years went by, it became
obvious that the shrimpers were
. not going to use the TED volun-
tarily.

“We really weren’t getting any- ,
where," said Chuck Oravetz, the
chief of the U.S. Fisheries’ protect-
ed species branch.

The issue came to a head last
year, when the Center for Envi-
ronmental Education announced its
intention to sue the U.S. Depart-
ment of Commerce, which oversees
the fisheries, for violations of the
Endangered Species Act. That led
to a compromise in which industry
representatives and environmen-
talists met over a period of weeks

to hammer out binding rules for the ’

use of the devices.

, When it was all over, 11 of the 12
negotiators signed the agreement.
The one who did not was Tee John
Mialjevich, who left the negotia-
tions suddenly when his mother
died. Since then, he has embarked
on a campaign to unite the shrimp-
ers against any new regulations,
and has attracted thousands of
people to rallies in Louisiana.

At public hearings along the gulf
coast as well as in Washington,
angry shrimpers have vowed never
to use the devices, even though just
catching a sea turtle carries with it
a. $20,000 fine. Politicians have
Joined the TED opposition, espe-
cially in Louisiana, where shrimp-
ing is one of the few profitable
industries left in the state. '

“Turtles don’t vote,” said Louisi-
ana Gov. Edwin W. Edwards. '

g‘-

Legislation Proposed

Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.),
who has referred to the issue as “a
few measly turtles,” has introduced
a bill to withhold funds for enforc—
ing use of the equipment from the
fisheries service next year.

“All I know is we’ve got hun-

dreds of families genuinely facing
critical hardships if they imple-

ment the regulations,” Livingston 1
said. “Certainly, no one wants the

turtles extinct, but I think they can
wait another year.”

Michael Bean of the Washing-

ton-based Environmental Defense .

Fund said he hopes that cooler

heads in the fishing industry will

prevail over the Mialjevich forces,
but he added: “What the ultimate
outcome will be is anyone’s guess
at this point.”

Back aboard the Longhorn, Car- ,
ole Allen, who chairs the conserva- ‘

tion organization Help Endangered
Animals—Ridley Turtles, sat on
the aft deck surrounded by the
emptied cartons and musing about
the ridley and why it is important
to save it.

To her, she said, it came down to

a moral question:

“This creature has been here
since the dinosaur age and it isn’t
declining because of something
unknown," she said. “Who are we
to alter the species that are out
there? Just because we can’t see
them all the time doesn’t mean
they aren’t wonderful creatures.”

Man sentenced
to 11 years for
burning dog

From Staff and Wire Reports

GAINESVILLE —— A Gainesville
man has been sentenced to 11 years
in prison after being convicted of
setting fire to a doghouse and burn-
ing a dog chained inside.

Hall County Superior Court
Judge J.D. Smith sentenced Travis
Charles Motes, 26, to the maximum
sentence possible for convictions of
second-degree arson and cruelty to
animals. Motes’ brother, Shannon
Lee Motes, about 20, also was con-
victed, and will be sentenced later.

District Attorney Andy Fuller
said the fire stemmed from a neigh-
borhood dispute over a barking dog.
The young Doberman pinscher was
on a chain and inside the doghouse
when it was doused with gasoline
and set afire. a '

Fuller said the dog had to be
put to death because of the bums it g
suffered. The incident occurred '

Patenting Animals

I question the decision by the U.S.

A11 living things have the same

cruelty on creatures who have never
harmed him and are powerless to defend
themselves against him. Ethics demands

ing all species of the planet, he sat .
“There is a human population ex-
iplosion, and at the same time out
i natural resources are dwindling quite
, rapidly,” Hoessle said. “There is this
' sudden problem that humanity faces.

“Zoos in general are focusing at-
tention on endangered species. We’ve
become survival centers. Now we’re
using our popularity and our facilities
to educate the visitor.” _

The St. Louis Zoo, a pioneer among
its peers during much of its 80-year
history, hopes to be in the vanguard
of wildlife management and educa-
tion programs. The $14 million center
is being built with money from the
zoo-museum tax and private and cor-
porate donations.

Said Hyland: “Zoos have to keep up
with the times, and they have to be
competitive. We’re going into the era
of electronics. There will be televi-
sion screens and computers all over
the new education center.”

The task of combining access to
live animals with the latest in high- '
tech gadgetry to entertain and yet
educate the Zoo’s visitors fell to
Charles “Chip” Reay, an architect
with Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum
lnc., designer of the center.

One recent weekend, Reay took a
reporter on a walk through the site,
which is between the Children’s Zoo
and the Gift Shop in the northwestern
corner of the 200. <

Work began in November and pro-
gressed quickly during the mild win-
ter. The foundation is finished, and
steel beams are awaiting erection.
The 55,000-square-foot building is on
schedule for completion in the fall of
next year.

Although the central rotunda of the
pavilionlike structure will be 65 feet
high — more than five stories —
from floor to peak, Reay said it would
appear to be a one-story building.

“It’s built into the bill, so the im-
pact from the park is sufficiently
ameliorated," Reay said. “Purposely, ’
the massiveness of the building has’
been minimized so as not to disrupt
the parklike setting of the 200. We
want to make it a good neighbor."

Like the adjacent buildings, the
center will be of red brick with a
ribbed aluminum roof with the color
and patina of aged copper.

A visitor entering from Forest Park
will be on the upper of the two levels,
both of which will be open to the
rotunda. The upper level will contain ,_
four main attractions: a 400-seat audi-
torium, the Hall of the Animals, the
Ecological Exhibit Hall and a restau-
rant with a deck that overlooks the
rest of the Zoo.

A film by Charles Guggenheim, an
internationally known maker of docu-
mentary movies, will be shown in the
auditorium. The theater's wide-
screen format and full-surround',
sound will be used to bring to life the
multitudes of the world’s animals,
from views inside a single cell to vast

migrations on the Serengeti plain in.
Tanzania.

classrooms, and offices for the Zoo
administration and the Zoo Friends
group.

Hyland and the others point out
that the center will allow the Zoo to
be used in the winter and in the eve-

the restaurant and gift shop. The Zoo
will be able to arrange catered eve-

“I didn’t want it at first —— they

talked me into it,” Gibson said of the
‘ job. “I had never taken the elephants
,‘ on stage by myself, and I had two

new assistants.

“I spent many sleepless nights won-
dering how I was going to pull this
off.”

But his first show went smoothly, as
have hundreds that followed.

“Oh, I was knocked down on the
stage last year, but it was nothing se-
rious,” said Gibson, still smiling.

Gibson’s 25-year tenure as head el-
ephant trainer is tops among the na-
tion’s zoo personnel, and it makes
him a valuable commodity in today’s
effort to save endangered species,
said Bruce Read, the 200’s curator of
large mammals.

“He has people coming from all
over to ask his advice,” Read said.
“Donn’s manipulation and confidence
with the elephants has helped our re-
search program.

“There’s a lot more than what you
see on the stage.”

But Gibson seems most at home on

the stage with Donna, Tanya, Clara,

Pearl and Marie -—'his 6,000-pound
co-stars.

Says Read: “I don’t know anybody
who enjoys his work as much as
Gibby does.”

Gibson’s show is something of a
musical revue with the. five not-so-
dainty ladies twirling, swaggering
and hopping to a rock ’n’ roll sound-
track. Gibson, in black beret, sun-
glasses and khaki safari jacket, also is
in perpetual motion. '

“I try to keep things moving so
there are no dead spots," he said. “I
pick the music myself. We used Mich-
ael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ the year that
was big, and the kids loved it.” .

The elephants’ lilifﬁi’ﬁQiiiiCt} makes

his job easy, Gibson said.

“Each elephant has a different per-
sonality,” he said. “Sometimes you
can see when they’re worked up, and

you calm them down before going on ‘

stage. They are smart animals.
“When the elephants are out in the
yard, I’ll got out and sit and watch
what they do naturally. Sometimes I
can develop that into a trick for the
show.”
Gibson said the main training tool

was a 36-inch wooden shaft with a ‘
. steel hook on the end. He said it was

used to gently pull and prod the ani-
mals.

“Their skin is thick but they have ,

nerve endings into the skin,” he said.

“They can feel when a fly lands on Z

them.

“I don’t use food to train them. You
use food and it’s the only thing they
think about. It takes time. Repetition
over and over again. They are ani-
mals, but they learn as fast as some
of the kids out there.

“We bring in machinery purposely
so the animals hear the noise. If they
hear thunder and lightning on stage,

- they’re not frightened cause they lis- |

ten to me.” ,-

And, yes,‘ elephants never forget, .

Gibson said.

“I had an elephant named Trudy.
Floyd Smith had taught her a Spanish
act with a tambourine. I had an act as
a matador and I was using a tambou-
rine. I took it out and Trudy started
beating it. We hadn’t done the act in
five years.”

Like all performers, Gibson prides
himself in never missing a show. He

said only one performance had been ‘

canceled in his career.
“If the people come out there, I’ll
put on the show,” he said. " ’

Giant panda to spend
mOnth in Memphis Zoo

 

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

City officials say panda-monium will hit
Memphis on Aug. 1.

A giant panda from the Chapultepec Park Zoo
in Mexico City is coming to the Memphis Zoo
Aug. 1 for about a month, Charles Wilson, zoo
director, said yesterday.

The visit had been scheduled for this month
but was delayed because of fund-raising and
government-permit problems.

Wilson said the cost of the panda project, ori-
ginally estimated at about $400,000, has been
out “almost in half” because Mexico City has
agreed to let the Memphis Zoo modify the gor-

illa exhibit in the Primate House for the panda , .

rather than constructing quarters almost from
scratch at the old tortoise building. -

Under the new plan, a glass wall will be con-
structed to enclose the outdoor part of the gor-
illa exhibit, and the moat will be filled in. This
“will make the surface area about five times
bigger,” Wilson said.

The 2-year-old, 220-pound panda, named Qiu
Hoa or Xiu Hua, which means “Dandelion,”
also will have access to the indoor gorilla exhi-
bit, where a small pool will be added.

The gorillas currently in the exhibit ——
Rocky, Tammy and Kwashi -— will be moved to
a holding area at the zoo hospital during the
panda’s stay. When they return to their home,
“they will have the immediate benefit of the

,. - ~_
\-

 

refurbished exhibit area,” Wil-
son said. ~ .

He said the modifications to
the gorilla exhibit will cost
about $68,000. The panda’s Visit
will be sponsored by the Coca-
Cola Bottling Co. of Memphis
and the Memphis Zoological So-
ciety, he said. In addition, Feder-
al Express Corp. has donated ser-
vices and will' fly the panda to
Memphis. American Airlines is
providing transportation for
city and zoo officials. _

Wilson said the panda Will be
in Memphis for “a minimum of
one month.” If the demand to see

 

 

the panda is high and if the ani-'

. mal remains in good shape, the

zoo has the option of keeping it
for a week or two longer, Wilson

said.

Wilson said he doesn’t antici-
pate any more delays in the visit.
“The reason we had delays in:
the first place is because the US.
Fish and Wildlife Commission
was not able to process the per—
mits as fast as we had h0ped."~.

The commission recently ap—
proved the panda’s entrance to
the US, as well as the exit of a .
gorilla and two orangutans to
Mexico. The Memphis Zoo
agreed to give Dinga the gorilla
and Woody and Lisa the orangu-
tans to Mexico City in order to

[\lew zoo ride
is humping -
to please kids

Officials hope for profits

 

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

One thing camel trainers learn early is they must
teach their animals not to spit.

Tony Malchow has been hit by many projectiles of
masticated cud shot from the rubbery cannon-mouths
i)’fk camels, and it’s one part of hiscareer he doesn’t
i e.

“It doesn’t cut or burn, but it does sting,” said Mal-
chow, 25, who has trained dromedaries (one-
humpers) and Bactrian camels (two-humpers) for
four years.

The four camels Malchow brought to the Memphis
Zoo thisweek —— Ashley, Peaches, Sammy and Casey ——
don’t spit. They are well-behaved and polite, as camels
go. They have to be, because they will spend the next
four months providing rides for children and adults
who want a taste of desert locomotion in a rainy river
town -—- a taste of Memphis, Egypt, in Memphis, Tenn.

.It is the first time in almost 20 years the zoo has pro-
v1ded animal rides for patrons, and the first time it
hasever offered rides on exotic animals. The zoo’s'
once-popular pony rides ended in 1969.

“As zoos have evolved, they have gotten farther and
farther away from anything carnival- or circus-like,”
said, PatriCia Tolbert, president of the Memphis Zoolo-
gical Soc1ety. Now, however, that trend is reversing
itself as zoos seek ways to raise money and attract at-
tention.

“So many people want to interact with animals,” she
said. “That’s why people want to feed the animals,
which isn’t the healthiest thing (for the animals).”

She said the camel rides “allow people to get up

By William E. Geist’

New York Times News Service

 

NEW YORK — “I’m sorry,” the
receptionist said to the caller,
saying what all good reception-
ists say: “Mr. Davis is busy at the

moment. No, Mr. Davis is not in

‘ conference. He’s washing a cat.”

I

A limousine was pulling up
with another client outside the
Mel Davis Dog Boutique, while
inside, the fur was ﬂying and
Mel — dog grobmer (and, occa-
sionally, cat washer) to the rich
and famous —— was lowering his
voice to let out a little secret:
“These two dogs mated before
their wedding ceremony.”

Mel, as everyone knows him,
was talking about the wedding
and prenuptial affairs of the late
J acquelineSusann’s dog, Joseph-
Ian, which took place in the
basement of his dog grooming
salon.

“Mel Davis is to dogs what
Kenneth is to women,” ex-
plained Lillian Ross, the New
Yorker magazine writer, refer-
ring to Kenneth B. Attelle, hair-
stylist of the rich and famous.
Ms. Ross faithfully takes her Gol-
die, an apricot miniature poodle,
to Mel’s salon.

For that matter, so does Ken-
neth, who takes Tiger, his shihe
tzu, to Mel.

“There is definitely a, Mel Da-
vis look,” said Georgette
Klinger, the skin-care entrepre-
neur, whose chauffeur and
housekeeper dropped off her
poodle, PooPy, at Mel’s, 316 East
49th Street.

Ms. Klinger brings him gifts of

6 skin lotion. “Mel has oily skin,

you know,”'she said.

“Most people give me their au-
tographed books,” he said, refer-
ring to the great number of auth-
ors in his clientele. “1 don’t read
them,” he said. "‘I’m too busy
clipping dogs.”

' “Bijou has jet lag,” cautioned

'Joan Helpern (of Joan and Da-
vid shoes), dropping off her dog, .

Tuesday.

“These are really East Side:

dogs, aren’t they?” commented
another customer.

 

”Indeed. one of Mel’s clients is

said to have had her dog’s sur- '
gery done at one of New York’s ’
finest human hospitals, where E

the client makes generous con-
tributions.

Another ‘ client said she I

brought her dog in for a beauty
treatment before its portrait was
done. When she was told that

one of Mel’s dogs had its photo-
, graph done by Francesco Sca-

vullo, the eminent photogra-

pher, she scoffed, “Oh, no. I’m

talking about an oil painting.”
“Mel diagnoses illnesses and

gives advice, too,” said another

client. “I have him tell me if I
need to spend the money taking
my dog to a veterinarian.”

On his wall, next to the auto-
graphed picture of Burt Reyn-
olds, whose Yorkie Mel
groomed, is a photograph of
Richard Nixon’s dogs — Pasha,
Vicky and Tim -— posingin front
of the White House. It is signed
“To Mel, With Best Wishes” with
the three dogs’ paw prints.

“We go to Mel because he
treats our four-legged children
lovingly and tenderly,” said Ms.
Helpern, echoing virtually all of
Mel’s clients. “Also, he has rea-
sonable prices,” said another cli-
ent, demanding anonymity.

“They love to go,” Lillian Ross
said. “Goldie runs in and kisses
Mel.” _

Several authors have men-

 

 

E'tioned Mel in their books, and

now Jo Ann Levine, a customer-

? writer, is collecting material for

an entire book on him entitled
Whose Dog Are You?

She said her research shows
that Mel has cared for, or still
does, the dogs of Marilyn Mon-
roe, Elizabeth Taylor, Bette Da-

.vis, Phyllis George, Sugar Ray

Robinson, Zsa Zsa Gabor and var-
ious and sundry Astors, Rocke-
fellers, Eisenhowers and the
like.

Mel is an unassuming man,
covered with dog hair most of
the time and unimpressed with
the fame or fortune of his
clients’ owners.

He said that although Cathy
Hardwick, the dress designer,
has her two poodles clipped in

. what Mel calls “a punk style,”
i the trend over all is to simple
cuts that require less mainte-
' nance by busy owners“

“The glamor age is out,” he
said. “People don’t dye their poo-
dles to match their apartments
any more” -— although Mel does
still dye some of them pink, blue
or apricot. More clients want co-

. lored bows for their poodles
than not. Mel paints the nails of
F many dogs and sprays most of
‘ the female poodles with L’Ori-

? gan cologne. ’

He recalled when the late Peg-
gy Starr Githens, a dog breeder,
.used to arrive in a white dress

E and white limousine when she

had her black poodle and in a
black dress and black limousine
when she brought her white
poodle.

As for trends in types of dogs,

i Mel said. “As the Westminster
' Dog Show goes, so goes the na-

tion. A German shepherd won

Foxhunt is classy,
but neighbors join
coyotes in a howl

 

By Sandra Chereb

United Press International

 

SIERRA HAVEN VALLEY, Nev.
—- For the past seven years Lynn
Lloyd has tried to lend the Ne-
vada wilderness a touch of class
by running a fox hunt of sorts
twice a week for six months of
the year.

But now, this colorful English
pastime, something of an anach-
ronism in this rugged and isolat-
ed corner of northern Nevada
along the California border, is in
jeopardy.

Too many of Ms. Lloyd’s neigh-
bors say they are fed up with the
bugle-blowing riders in red jack-
ets and black caps who trespass
their property while howling
hounds pursue the “foxes,”
which are really coyotes.

“They just want to run her out
of the valley,” an investigator
for a localgovernment agency
said of Ms. Lloyd’s detractors. “If
Lloyd’s riders had Western sad-
dles, bandanas around their
necks and a canister of chew in
their hip pocket, they wouldn’t
be complaining about her.” '

Ms. Lloyd’s fox hunts do not in-
volve foxes; there are none here.
But there are coyotes aplenty,
and to Ms. Lloyd — founder of
Red Rock Hounds, the Silver
State’s only fox hunt club — they

are perfectly acceptable substi-
tutes. ,

Her club has about 20
members of whom 10 to 15 usual-
ly participate in the two-hour
weekend hunts.

The conﬂict between Ms.
Lloyd and some surrounding
property owners has divided
this rural community of about
100. '

“This whole thing is really
sad,” one neighbor said. “I hate
the whole thing because they’re
lovely people on both sides. But
it’s getting to the point where
it’s those who are ‘for’ Lynn pit-
ted against those who are
‘against’ her.”

Among Ms. Lloyd’s supporters
is Kathy Watson, who said she

. and her husband enjoy the hunt
“because as far as we’re con-

cerned, it brings a touch of class

and color to an otherwise borin

valley.” -

Other area residents, how-
ever, threaten to shoot the next
rider to ruffle their sagebrush.

“I just don’t want her and her
bunch running rampant like
they own it all,” said Paul Hes-
selschwerpt, who left the South
Side of Chicago with his wife,
Shirley, three years ago to home-
stead 10 acres about two miles
from Ms. Lloyd’s place.

“If it takes guns to stop her,
that’s what it’s going to take,” he
said.

Ms. Lloyd, a 37-year-old native

'of Pennsylvania, says the esca-

lating controversy leaves her
bewildered.

“With all this room out here,
can you believe all this fuss?
This place was made to ride. I
can’t understand it,” she said.

Hesselschwerpt said the main
concern about the hunts is 1i-
ability. “Ninety-five percent of
the gripe with us down here is
we don’t want to be held liable
when somebody gets hurt. We’ve

got enough problems without

some yahoo coming down here
making trouble.”

Ms. Lloyd said that is not a legi-
timate concern because she has
liability insurance. She also said
she asks residents if they mind
the hunts coming through their

property and “if they do, we just .

don’t ride there.”

Some neighbors dispute that
assertion.

“People have asked her not to
ride on their property but she
does it anyway,” one said. “Lynn

Lloyd has a general disregard-

for the people who moved out
here. The hunt is gorgeous, but
she should keep it on her own 10
acres.” -

Some residents also blame Ms.
Lloyd’s fox hunts for what they
say is the disappearance of wild-
life from the area.

“We used to have herds of wild

horses, deer, antelope come
down from the hills and feed in
our back yard,” Shirley Hes-
selschwerpt said. “We don’t
have them any more because of
her.”

Because of threats of violence
by Ms. Lloyd’s foes, the Washoe
County Sheriff’s Office persuad-
ed her to cancel her last sched-
uled hunt of the season earlier
this month. - .

“Hopefully, we can get this

thing worked out by next year,”
one investigator said. .
' But for the time being, tension
is running so high that deputies
had to escort Ms. Lloyd and
about 15 riders out of the Sierra
Haven Valley when the last hunt
was held March 28.

“With all the threats and accu-
sations ﬂying around out there,
there’s just no telling what
might have happened,” a deputy
said.

Neighbor complaints have
prompted investigations by the
Bureau of Land Management
and the Washoe County Sheriff’s
Office, but the agencies say Ms.
Lloyd has not done anything
that warrants official action.

. The dispute has spilled over ‘
into other areas. . .
The Rancho Haven Homeown-
ers Association is seeking to re- .
voke her business license to
train and board ho'rses — an-
other of Ms. Lloyd’s occupations
-—- on grounds she is violating as-
sociation rules against commer-
cial ventures in residential

areas

Ms. Lloyd said she has written
approval from the association to
run her operation, and an inves-
tigator in the Washoe County
Sheriff’s Office confirmed such
a document exists.

The dispute will come to a
head when Ms. Lloyd’s business
licence comes under review at a
public hearing of the Washoe
County Board of Commis-
sioners.

US. rounds up options
for wild horses, burros

By George Lurie
USA TODAY

CANON CITY, Colo. — Bob Burford, Bureau of Land Man-
agement chief, is getting a lot of mail lately —- much of it com-
plaining about his proposal that could mean death to as many
as 5,000 wild horses and burros.

About 500 letters have come in since the idea surfaced on
April 27.

“Killing these animals would be both cruel and a terrible
waste,” said the American Humane Society’s Dennis White.

“We destroy 8 million to 10 million excess dogs and cats
each year,” said BLM’s John Boyles. “These surplus wild hors-
es and burros are just too expensive to maintain indeﬁnitely.”

Spurred by cattle ranchers who view the wild horses as a
threat to public grazing lands, the BLM rounds up thousands of
the animals each year from 10 Western states. The animals
are offered to the public for $125 each, and so far, homes have
been found for 70,000 of them.

But it takes $9.3 million a year to keep the surplus horses
and burros in facilities in Texas, Nebraska and Nevada, and
BLM is looking for a way to cut costs.

Some ideas: lifting a ban on destruction of healthy wild hors-
es and burros; cutting adoption fees; giving away older, less
desirable animals; or expanding a cowboy inmate program be-
ing tried at the Canon City Prison.

A decision is expected in July.

The Canon City cowboy inmates are training 360 wild horses
for adoption and use by the US. Forest Service.

Only one of the 28 inmates involved has had experience
with horses, but BLM project coordinator Jeff Weeks said the
plan “has been more successful than we ever imagined.”

“Before this, the only horses I’d seen were the ones on the
merry-go-round at Coney Island,” said New Yorker Melvin Bil-

"

lips, 34 -— imprisoned since 1972 on robbery charges.

Tony Bainbridge, an ex-ranch hand who heads the program,
talks of expanding the prison stable to 1,000 horses.

“We’ve got a good thing going here,” he said. “Everybody’s a
winner — the horses, the inmates and the taxpayers.”

A plan. that could lead to the death of 5,000 wild horses and
burros has generated mail from students and adults.

Oregon — “I think that you should not kill them. They’ve got as much as a
right to live as we do.” Holly Cartney, 10, Junction City

Utah - “Sell them to people to make dog and cat food or mink food. They
should be disposed of, not kept and fed.” A.F. Pierce, Salt Lake City

Vermont — “Let’s keep the Mustang great, strong, smart fast and FREE.”
» . Eric Jensen, Riverton

Colorado —- “I resent that you plan to rob me of part of my heritage ...
and one of God’s most beautiful creations. Larry W. Lindsey, Denver

Utah — “There is no justification for the expense involved in keeping
these animals. . . it isn’t even humane to keep them penned up.” Robert G.

_ and Margaret 8. Heers, Salt Lake City

California — “I strongly urge you to reconsider your infamous, uncon-
scious plan.” Lawrence E. Weiss, Santa Rosa

Wyoming — “Why do people think everything belong to them?. The
horses own this land too! Don’t be so ruthless!” Carolyn Bagwell, Chey-
enne

Virgina — “All you people care about is the greedy interest of the sheep
and cattle growers with no concern whatsoever for these very beautiful
and noble animals.” James R. Hamilton, Richmond

Maryland — “Turn them loose and let them be what they are.” Alice K.
Helm, Bethesda

Montana— “Let’s put an end to holding thousands of horses for the sake
of making their ‘protectors’ happy. It would be much more humane to just
get rid of them.” Kathy Weger Fluer, White Sulphur Springs

New York — “I was distressed and disgusted to read about the proposal.”
Susan E. Henke, Shrub Oak

Wyoming — “Bravo! Such policy should permit you to clear the pipeline
of unwanted wild horses and burros, albeit still too slowly.” Norman Palm,
Elk Mountain

Catiiornia— “These wild horses have the same right to life and liberty as
we human animals.” Tina Frisco, Oakland

Frog-leg con tro vers y Whe ts ecolo

more — is just spent again on chemical
pesticides to do what the frog population
did naturally.

By ADAM KELLIHER
of‘United Press International

' 'NEW DELHI, India — The frog-infested
swamps of India, Bangladesh and Indonesia
have become a battleground between ecolo-
gists and Epicureans, the former who like
frogs in the mud and the latter who like
them with white wine.

"’ Experts say the harvest of frogs for frog
le'gs has reached such proportions that
there are not enough left to control insects
and other pests that plague the rice fields.

.‘vThe situation has become sufficiently
critical that the Indian government has
banned export of frog legs, thus threatening

 

w

the supply to better restaurants in Europe
and North America.

“We have carried out studies that
showed frogs have a very important envi-
ronmental role to play in pest control,” said

S.K. Mukherjee, a director of the Environj

ment Ministry who lobbied for the ban.

The move followed that of China, which
also has banned frog hunting.

Ecologists say frogs eat their weight in
insects and small land-crabs every day. Left
unchecked, the pests burrow away at the
containment walls of rice paddy fields.

But villagers also are paid well to cap-
ture frogs for export. Ecologists point out,
however, that the money earned -— and

“The front half of a frog, resting on its
bleeding belly, propped up on its fore feet
and staring helplessly at the world around
it is a ghastly sight,” said Abdulali.

Trade in frog legs blossomed after res-

; taurants in North America and Europe con-
' sumed their own frog populace.

India’s trade peaked in 1981, when 4,368
tons of frog limbs were sent abroad, earn-
ing about $9.3 million. When the ecological

.damage became apparent, however, the
government imposed a 2,800-ton maximum
and ordered that the frogs be electrically
stunned before execution.

Nevertheless, India remained the

’

“It is a losing proposition from all view-

points,” said Humayan Abdulali of the Bom-
bay Natural History Society. “But money
makes the man go.”

Besides ecological arguments, opposi-

tion against the trade came from a repug-
nance toward amputation methods.

Once caught, the frogs are taken to cut-

ting centers where workers dunk them in a

salt-and-chlorine solution to kill bacteria.
The frog is then held by the hind legs and
chopped in half, the front portion staying
alive until it bleeds to death.

120 million frogs last year. More than 200
million frogs are harvested globally to sup-
ply restaurants mostly in the United States,
France, Holland, Italy and Belgium.

Not everyone agrees there is a problem.

Dr. P.V. Dahadrai, who directs the fish-
eries section of India’s Agriculture Minis-
try, said that frog culling is restricted to two
edible breeds and that the 23 other variet-
ies of frogs and toxic toads are enough to
keep the insect population in check.

“Any pseudo-intellectual can create a
problem,” he said. “The frog will sustain
itself because nature is tenacious.”

He said foreign trade and about 1.5 mil-
lion jobs would be lost by the export ban.

Whatever the case, India’s moves will
not stop the morsels from ending up in the
great restaurants of the West.

No Dog RacingOn The North Side ‘

The Metropolitan Coalition for a Better

St. Louis isn’t as noble as it sounds — un-
less, of course, one agrees with the group’s

contention that St. Louis would be made
better by having a dog-racing track on the
North Side. The group is probably only one

- of several —- including the city itself —

that is at the starting line to place a dog-
racmg track at the site of the General Mo-

.. tors truck assembly plant.

_ -‘ “This outfit seems to have everything fig-
ured out, while overlooking the fact that
; dog racing isn’t the economic shot that the

North Side needs. But to hear a coalition
spokesman tell it, you’d assume the group
were bringing another factory and thou-
sands of jobs to replace the GM plant.

It is interesting that the coalition in-
cludes a planner for a consulting firm that
conducted a so-called re-use analysis of
the GM plant site for the city. Did that
study. give theplanner an inside track or

otherwise affect the outcome of the study?
This is not to suggest any wrongdoing, but
to raise questions about the integrity of
studies by companies whose workers may
havea personal interest in the outcome.

Asrde from that, the coalition ought to
heed the views of North Side neighborhood
assocrations, many of which are opposed to
the dog-racing proposal. The head of one
group notes that the area is in far more
need of labor-intensive industry than ser-
vrce-oriented entertainment. This makes it
questionable for the city itself to push for a
track at the site of the plant.

.The city’s emphasis on developing indus-
trial parks to attract more business — and
Jobs — ought to apply to the site, which GM
wrll abandon in August. It is a prime piece
of real estate, and the city should make an
extra effort to find a replacement business
that would fill the economic gap left by
GM’s departure.

DALLAS MORNING NEWS - May 10, 1987

The chimpanzees that are winning hearts in
Project X have found a home in Texas.

In the current film, airman Matthew Broderick is
punished for taking his girlfriend for a ride in an
Air Force jet. He’s assigned to a topsecret military
experiment using chimps. At the lab, he befriends
Virgil, a simian trained to use sign language.

Ironically the chimps, which are saved from fatal
exploitation in the movie, nearly met a sadder fate
in real life.

 

 

SUMNER Wallace Swett, director of Primarily Primates, a
FILM & TV non-profit San Antonio-based organization that reha-
OUTTAKES bilitates non-native animals, says that when Project

 

X was made last year, “The film people were igno-
rant about what happens to ‘humanized’ chimps.” Swett notes that such
chimps usually end their lives in medical research programs.

Before the film was completed, arrangements were made to place five of
the chimps in animal facilities in New York and Arizona. What the studio
didn’t know, Swett says, was that they would be entering research labs.

“That was unacceptable to 20th Century-Fox,” Swett says. “They were
steered our way.”

According to Swett, a “humanized” chimp kept in isolation and dominated
by a trainer loses the ability to relate to its own kind -—— socially or sexually.
It develops neurotic, sometimes self-mutilating, behavior. Primarily Pri-
mates teaches them to be “comfortable being chimps."

A trained chimp has the potential for a 55-year life span. But by age 5, it
weighs 150 pounds, has a volatile temper and is stronger than a human male.
Swett says he told the producers the organization lacked permanent quarters
for the chimps. A newly constructed $50,000 habitat already had three occu~
pants.

“We had the expertise but no place to put them,” Swett says. The studio .
provided $35,000 toward construction, but a promised benefit in Los Angeles
to raise the rest was held in San Antonio instead. It raised less than $1,000.

' Then, animal rights advocate Bob Barker, host of The Price Is Right game
show, came forward with the necessary $25,000. Swett says the new complex,
which has corridors, rooms and arenas, is almost complete.

Swett says the Project X chimps are losing their readiness to respond to
human commands and learning to live together harmoniously. “It was three
or four months before we could get them into groups of two. Now we have
one group of three.”

In a recent TV interview, Broderick said he felt sad when the 17-week
shoot ended and the chimps were gone from his life. Now he can see them '
again, if he wants. Swett has invited Broderick to visit his “co-stars” any
time.

Gorillas, Friends SampleZoo’s New Yard ‘

A penny for your thoughts, Fred.

Fred is the St. Louis Zoo’s 320-
pound “silverback” lowland gorilla,
and his mind must have been spin-
ning Wednesday.

The Zoo opened its new outdoor
gorilla yard for the first time and
invited some 2,100 members of its
Friends Association for a sneak
preview. The exhibit will open to
the public at 9 am. Saturday.

Fred was born in the wild, but
has spent nearly all of his 28 years
in captivity. .

When the door to the yard
opened, Fred saw for the first time '
in decades what his home in the
tropics of western Africa looked

“Everyone thinks gorillas are

Fred arrived at the Zoo in May of

the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago,

breaking several bones in his arm.

By Henry Wood
and Jerry Crimmins

A 69-year—old workman was se-
verely mauled Wednesday by two
Great Danes owned by a woman
who had hired the man to work
behind her home on South Indi—
ana Avenue, police said.

The workman, identiﬁed by po—

lice as Gillard D. Robinson, of

343 W. 93d St., was undergoing
.surgery Wednesday night in Christ
Hospital and Medical Center, Oak
Lawn. He had been listed in criti-

' a, cal condition.

Police said that Robinson was
-bitten on the arms, chest, head
and throat and that he suffered a
punctured lung.

7 According to Police Sgt. Alvin
Palmer Jr. of the Pullman Area,
Robinson and another workman,

, whose name was not learned, were

hired to repair a fence at the
home of a woman at 9441 S. Indi-
-ana Ave.

Some time after 3 p.m., the
homeowner thought Robinson and
hlS partner were gone, Palmer

_ said. She opened her door, and

two of the three Great Danes that
live in the house bolted and at-
tacked Robinson who was still in
the yard. The second worker ﬂed,
Palmer said.

Empldyees of the city’s Depart-
ment of Animal Control corralled
the two dogs that attacked Robin-
son and took them to the city’s
Animal Control Center, 2741 S.
Western Ave., for observation,
Palmer said.

'Robinson’s granddaughter, .Re-
gina Parker, said Robinson is a
carpenter.

Patricia Morris, of 9436 S. Indi-
ana Ave., who lives across the
street from the scene of the attack,
gave a different version of the inci-
dent. '

Morris said she heard that Rob-
inson was in the alley when the
woman who hired him came out
the door to empty the garbage and
the two dogs ran out.

around the yard, Morris said.

Morris said Robinson’s co-work-
er ran to the home of Morris”
mother at 9440 S. Indiana Ave. to
call for help.

Morris said that the first of
many calls to 911 was placed at 3
pm. from her mother’s home, but
she said a Fire Department ambu-
lance did not arrive until 3:45
pm. She said neighbors were
afraid to move Robinson because
of his severe wounds.

A Fire Department spokesman
said in response, “We got the call
from the police department at
15:37 [3:37 p.m.].” The ambu-
lance arrived with Robinson at
Christ Hospital at 4:04 p.m., the
spokesman said. '

Morris said the Great Danes
have attacked other people in the
neighborhood. “We really do not
want the dogs back because we
have small children. We really are
terriﬁed of those dogs,” she said.

The dog owner also keeps
peacocks, geese, chickens and
ducks in a coop in the yard, Mor-
ris said.

What he did was bold, something unheard

raised more than $400,000 at one time before.

I’d also like for us to come up with some- .
thing permanent at the chimpanzee habitat
that will continue to say thank you, David, for
as long as the exhibit is there. I’ve got some

ideas; tell me yours. We can make it special

TAMPA TRIBUNE - May 13, 1987

 

By MICHAEL I... FIELD
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — A wage grievance
brought by workers at Lowry Park
Zoo has led to claims of poor care
and unhealthy conditions for zoo an-
imals.

Two current. zoo keepers and
one former zoo keeper filed the

claim against the city in March, -

seeking back pay for overtime they
say they worked.

Mark Costabell, 26, and Pam
Heeschen, 28, filed the grievance

along with former zoo keeper Kathy
Trogdon, 30. Trogdon now works for
the Oglebay Good Zoo in Wheeling,
W.Va., and says her resignation
from Lowry Park had nothing to do
with the grievance. "

The three appeared at a closed

hearing Monday before Cynthia

Sontag, the city’s director of admin-
istration, to present their claims un-
der a union grievance procedure.
They are represented by the Amal-
gamated Transit Union Local 1464.

The three said the overtime was
earned during the past 15 months

when great efforts were made to
improve zoo conditions.

A $20 million renovation pro-
gram for the zoo is under way, the

~ first phase of which should be com-

pleted in January 1988, zoo officials
said.

But the renovation program has
done little to improve the immedi-
ate situation at the zoo, the employ-
ees say. Deteriorated facilities and
too few zoo keepers to upgrade
them required employees to work
hundreds of hours in overtime, for
which they were not compensated,

the workers said.

City officials declined comment
on the grievance. A decision could
be reached‘in five days, but the city
could seek an extension.

The zoo keepers, however, also
had strong criticism for some cur-
rent practices at the zoo and condi-
tions in which animals are kept.

“First, I think we should point
out that there have been tremen-
dous improvements made at the
Lowry Park Zoo in the last 15
months," Costabell said. “But the
situation there is still very bad for

the animals in a lot of ways.”

 

- v.-_-.- M. N<‘Al"ﬂ.—-—.¢.IQ ‘4

\l’

' and that leads to unhealthy condi-
' tions for the animal.”

Costabell also said the cages are
so old the animals sometimes chew
or claw holes in them. Zoo keepers
“' have had to repair the chain-link
cages three times in recent months
when animals gnawed opening in
, the sides, he said.

“These cages aren’t the safest
' ones around, for us or the animals,”
\ he said. “They’re rusted through in
spots. Considering what has hap-

 

pened, there are some cages out
there that I just don't like to go in.”
City officials disputed the zoo
keepers’ assessment of Lowry's con-
dition.
“When you start listening to the
words of some disgruntled employ-

ees, it’s not fair to anyone,” said Jo-.

seph Abrahams, administrator of
the Parks, Recreation and Cultural
Services Department.

_ “It’s just not fair to all the pens

ple who have worked so hard to

make that a good zoo,” Abrahams
said angrily. “There are a lot of
people working very hard to raise

money to build the new zoo. I’d hate

 

Costabell, who has worked at the ,
zoo since February 1986, said un-
healthy conditions exist for some
animals because their cages are too
small. In some cases, zoo keepers
can’t move animals to other quar-
ters to adequately clean the cages,
he said. _

“There’s nowhere else to move
them to —— it’s as simple as that," he
said. “That means we can’t get in-

to see these disgruntled employees
discourage that effort and ruin it for
everyone."

Zoo Superintendent Doug Porter
responded that the cages, although
old and small, still meet or exceed
legal requirements for zoos across
the country.

“But we recognize the animals
do need better conditions," Porter

said. “That’s why the city has com-j

mltted $8 million to the 200’s reno-
vation. The first phase of the new
zoo will be designed to take care of
the animals’ needs. But it takes time
to get the construction done."
Porter said the cages are tempo-

side the cage to clean it properly \

rary facilities in use only until the
animals can be moved into the new
200 sometime early next year. He
also denied claims by Costabell that
injured animals at the zoo will be
kept in small, off-exhibit cages in

the new park. '

“That’s simply not true,” Porter
said. “All of the animals, with the
exception of the two otters, will be
in the new zoo and those will be in
the next phase.

“We’re all looking forward to
this new zoo,” he added. “ When it’s
done it will be fabulous. There’s no
doubt in my mind.”

 

 




DECATUR/DEKALB NEW ERA

(Atlanta) — May 7, 1987

Not Changing Parties, Planning

Former DeKalb County Commissioner Liane Levetan, center, an
avowed Democrat, had her picture taken recently with, of all things,
an elephant. Levetan is among the DeKalb supporters of the new Zoo
Atlanta pictured getting ready for the upcoming Beastly Feast silent
auction and party. Steve Goodman and Carolyn Lee Wills, along with
elephant keeper Gary Roesinger helped three-year-old Starlet O’Hara
toast the May 9 black-tie event, to be held in a tent at the zoo.

Benefit chairman Wills chose “Proud as a Peacock” of the new zoo
as the theme for the evening. Auction chairman Goodman has set a
$10,000 goal for the event. Levetan is co-chairman of the benefit.
Auction items include comedian Jerry Farber’s services, kicking
lessons with Atlanta Falcon Mick Luckhurst, a meal with soccer star
Pele, tennis with Mayor Andrew Young, weekend trips, champagne
and a private screening of a movie for 200 people.

Once again, the poignant pen of Bill Day
proves the old adage: “One picture is

The heart of the matter

JUST ABOUT the time I think Bill Day has
outdone himself with his drawings, he comes
up with another — the drawing of the
Dalmatian. I think that dog mourning his
friends goes right to the heart, and I’m sure
fire fighters everywhere can relate to that.

We mourn with him

BILL DAY’S Dalmatian in the Free Press
said it all. We all mourn with him and our
tears flow unchecked. Day deserves a prize
for this heartrending drawing. It needed no
caption whatsoever.

0n the loss of dear friends

AS A lover of dogs, I want to commend
you on your drawing by Bill Day.

The beloved Dalmatian says it all for
everyone: “We have lost some. dear friends,
and I am so sad.” The artwork is great, and
the feeling of all is expressed in the dog‘s face.
He also has lost some dear friends because, as
we all know, Dalmatians and the fire depart-
ment go hand in hand.

sticks at a bush. When we got up
close, we saw a pregnant cat catch-

kids aside and brought her home.
She had six healthy kittens that
night.

“It seems you’re petting a kitten
and the next minute you realize
there’s not that much difference be-
tween that kitten and a pig or a
cow or a monkey.”

The idea for the album came in
1980, when he heard the anti-fur
song “Skin” by Siouxsee and the
Banshees. “It wasn’t preachy, which
I think turns a lot of peOple off,”
says Mathews. “I started thinking
about the new music scene — even
if not everyone listens to it, every-
one talks about it. It draws atten-
tion to serious issues. It’s not all
love, love, love and let’s dance,
dance, dance.”

In 1985, when he joined the
PETA staff in Washington, DC,
Mathews began work on' the record-
ing project. A] Jourgensen, a mem-
ber of the band Ministry and a prin-
cipal in Chicago’s Wax Trax
Records, agreed to handle the rec-
ord. HOping to produce a compila-
tion of previously released material,
Mathews sent out the call for songs.

“We were offered more songs
than we could handle on one record.
I decided we had to produce a tight
album with every song directly re-
lated to an animal-rights issue ——
nothing vague.”

Council bans commerCIal testing of anImals

United Press international

CAMBRIDGE, Mess. — The 10-

cal government, in what animal‘-
rights activists say is the first such

action in the nation, has outlawed
commercial testing of animals —-
prohibiting procedures that blind
rabbits and kill dogs simply so labs
can deve10p cosmetics and
shampoos

All nine members of the council
voted without discussion Monday
night for an ordinance that does not
affect tests on animals for human

medical research but does ban two
tests used for developing cosmetics
and household chemicals.

The ordinance subjects laborato-
ries that ignore the ban to up to
$250 in fines per violation r day
and gives the city Animal gemmis-
sion power to shut down research
institutions that commit serious or
repeated violations.

7 ~ Louise and her fellow llamas are
no longer on the wrong side of the

‘ ‘ After a year of legal wrangling
and appeals, the Broward County
Commission on Tuesday agreed to
.bhange the zoning laws to allow
Louise and three other llamas --

Sphants,” said, George Gaiters?) as-
sistant director of the county Zon-
ing Division.

“All the neighborhood kids think
they’re wonderful. They’re docile
animals,” said Commission Chair-
man Howard Forman. The com-
mission vote was unanimous;

“We’ve had these animals for 12
years,” said Ha jos, a salesman who
also keeps exotic birds. “We were

Stormy, Bo and Cookie, by name --
to continue living on a lot in an un-
incorporated area between Pem-
broke Pines and Cooper City.
Llamas are related to the camel
family but do not have humps. On
Tuesday, the commissioners
agreed to consider them in the
same category as cows and horses.
That means Marvin Hajos, of the
3500 block of Northwest 94th Ave-

going to exhaust every effort to
keep them and, if not, we would
have tried to find them decent
homes. This is a big relief.”
Because llamas are so rare,
county officials originally desig-
nated them as “exotics,” which are
banned in the area where Hajos
lives. The Florida Administrative
Code lists llamas as wildlife, which
was another strike against Louise,

South American pets, despite the '
previous opposition of the state and
the county Zoning Board and Board
of Adjustment.

So can anyone else who lives on a r

allow the llamas, then come ele-

Bo, Cookie and Stormy, since wild I
animals also are prohibited there.

As a result, when the commission
tried to define the llamas as domes-
ticated pets last October, it was
blocked by the state law and was
unsuccessful.

But on Tuesday, it classified the
llamas in the same category as ,
cows and horses.

BARRON SUN — Barrow, Alaska — 4/30/87

Whaling Good

to the South

The spring whaling season's third and
fourth whales were harvested last
Thursday and Friday by whalers from
Gambell and Wales. '

Wales Captain Ray Seetook and his
crew harvested a 28 1/2 foot bowhead on
April 23. The crew lost a line, a darting
gun and a ﬂoat when the whale dived
after being struck; the wind was
blowing ten miles an hour when the
whale was struck, but during the tow
rose to 50 miles an hour. Despite that
and young ice conditions, Seetook and
his crew managed to get the whale ashore
and saved it all for their village.

Gambell came right along behind
Wales on April 24 to harvest that
village's second whale of the season, a
SS-footer. Led by Captain Ralph
Apatiki, the Gambell crew struck its
whale between 4 and 6 in the afternoon
about 13 miles west of Gambell, among

moving ice bergs. The crew from

, .Savoonga went out to help, and the
: harvest was accomplished.

A Savoonga crew, led by Captain

I Clarence Waghiyi, harvested Savoonga's

first whale of its quota of three on April
16 near the south end of St. Lawrence
Island. A crew from Gambell came
down and helped tow the 49 footer.

The harvests leave Gambell with one
whale left in its quota of three, Wales
with one in its quota of two, and
Savoonga with two of its quota of three.

Whaling crews and their captains in
the other villages having quotas are ready
for the hunt, according to Ron Kalikak,

AEWC administrative director. Whales

have been sighted at Pt. Hope; at
Barrow and Wainwright, however, ice
conditions are poor, and strong winds had
been blowing the ice inland. Wind
conditions changed somewhat since the
weekend, Kalikak said, and crews are
keeping their eyes Open and making good
use of the marine band radios being used
for the ﬁrst time in this year's hunt. ,
Not just whalers, but everyone is
tuned to the whaling season. Barrow
Mayor Nate Olemaun has reminded
residents to avoid open lead areas during

the season. And City Clerk Karen"

‘ Bumell has been on the'radio asking
' peeple against using ﬁrearms or burning

at the dump until whaling crews have
had their harvest.

The annual whale census by the North
SIOpe Borough's Department of Wildlife
Management began April 10, with a
hydrophone in place at the edge of the
lead off NARL. Wildlife management
staffers Craig George and Geoff Carroll
are listening for whale calls picked up by
the underwater microphone and broadcast
back to their laboratories with the help
of a transmitter on the surface of the ice.

George explains that this year the
scientists are concentrating on the
whales' swim speeds, time under water,
and swim angles. Data on those matters
will ﬁll in the gaps of the vast pool of
information the department has gathered
since thecensus began about ten years

ago.

The census has been the

‘responsitilibty of the North Slope

Borough since 1981.

 




SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE

Fair Hunting

Editor — Robert Carl Gibbert’s
letter last week correcting anti-hunt-
er misconceptions regarding the
methodology of lion hunting is
scarcely a testament to sport or skill
as defined by most rational human
beings. To wit, “They are shot at
close range with handguns and rifles
after being fairly pursued by trained
dogs or expert trackers." Gibbert’s
definition of fairness and myown
diverge at the point where the train-
ed dogs, expert trackers, and hand—
guns and rifles enter the picture.

' Shouldn’t the lion be provided with
similar services by the hunters, gratis,

. as atestament to the concept of

fairness? For example, it might be '

useful for the lion to be equipped
with some anti-dog dogs of his own.
Pit bulls could at leastfind meaning-
ful employment in this endeavor.

As a counter to the expert tracker.
perhaps the lions could be provided
with an expert tracker of their own
to obfuscate the animal’s traces.

Should the hunters fairly over-
come these obstacles, it would seem
only reasonable to allow the lion 0
number of combat veterans with
handguns and rifles to defend the
lion against the armed onslaught of
the hunters.

I am moved to volunteer my ser-
vices for the lions, purely in the spirit
of fairness exemplified by Gibbert
and others of his fair-minded ilk.

GEORGE BERTELSTEIN
San Francisco

Editor — Gibbert has many lofty
words about the American heritage
of hunting when he writes of moun-
toin lions, and many not-soslofty
words about the ignorant who 'do
not share his views.

It takes a special kind of person
who will hide behind today's wea-
pons, employ a pack of dogs and
assisting trackers to tree one of no-
ture's few remaining magnificent
beasts, and then with complete safe-
ty and leisure, slaughter it for plea-
sure. Heritage, courage, intelligence,
or challenge have nothing to do with
it.

The problem lies in learning how
to live so that those who come after
us will be able to have some of the
natural world to enioy. So far, the
battle is far from won.

Animal Rights

Editor — I read with dismay the
story in The Chronicle April 21,
which not only tended to confirm
that the Animal Liberation Front
probably did in fact set the fire at
the University of California at Davis,
but that at least one spokesperson
from another animal rights group
was glad they had done it.

I fail to understand how anyone
who is working for animal rights
could be happy about an event
which is a setback for our cause. in
recent years the animal rights move»
ment has made great strides, primar-
ily as a result of using education
rather than spontaneous emotional
outbursts as their main tactical pro.
cedure.

Rescuing animals from torture is
one thing, arson and slashing of tires
is an entirely different matter. Such
destructive acts are not only harmful -
in themselves, but will also turn peo—

ple away from our cause.

Chimp expert says limit experiments '

By JEFF HERMAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — Renowned research-
er Jane Goodall, who has spent 26
years studying chimpanzees in Afri-
ca, said Tuesday that animal experi-
mentation should end if conditions
for the animals are not improved.

Goodall, speaking at a press con?
ference at the downtown Hyatt Re-
gency, said “well over half” the
medical research involving chim-
panzees is unnecessary. Goodall is
in Tampa to deliver a lecture to-
night to benefit Lowry Park 200.

“It’s not overnight that we are
going to find an alternative to ani-
mal experimentation. But that is
what we must aim for,” she said.

Goodall, 52, says she still is
learning from chimpanzees in Tan-
zanian forests, and improving the
conditions of chimpanzees in captiv-
ity is just part of her work.

Goodall said she toured a Wash-
ington medical laboratory that had
been raided by an animal rights
group and found the conditions "-tru
ly terrible.” Two 3- or _4oyear.old
chimps were being kept in in a cage
that was 22 inches by 22 inches and
2 feet tall.

 

 

- tions humane,

In December, she said, the Jane
Goodall Institute for Wildlife Re-
search, Education and Conservation
plans to host a seminar for people
who oversee animal experiments to
develop ways that the animals can
be more humanely treated.

The institute helps ensure con-
tinuation of the studies at the
Gombe Stream Wildlife Preserve
and supports more research on

Animals: Handled With Care
At Riverbanks Zoo

Each morning, Dave Nellermoe is up
early in his kitchen in Columbia, South
Carolina, banging pots and pans and hur-
rying with breakfast. There’s no time to
waste. He has 700 hungry mouths to feed.

Nellermoe’s “kitchen” is his ofﬁce—the
central commissary at Riverbanks Zoolog-
ical Park. And while his title is commissary
supervisor, “chef” would more accurately
describe his work.

On the stainless-steel preparation tables,
he and four commissary workers chop,
shred, peel, and mix entrees for 200 mam-
mals and 500 birds in this animal kingdom
near downtown.

Most of the animals are fed just before
the gates open to the public at 9 am. Early
morning is a good time to visit the 200,
when hungry animals are stretching their
legs and zookeepers are busy with cleaning
the animal habitats.

The commissary is one of the nerve
centers of the 200. There, a diet card kept
for each type of animal lists the best mix-
ture of vitamins and minerals. For exam-
ple, marmosets, which are primates, are
fed apples, peeled oranges, bananas,
grapes, and a commercial brand of “mon-
key chow,” a dry food similar to what you
feed your dog. Giraffes get hay and root
vegetables, with meat—based diets going to
carnivores and birds of prey.

“This is feline diet,” says Nellermoe,
standing in the cold storage room holding
up a tube of meat resembling sausage. “It’s
horsemeat—based, and in it are bone, hair,

Dave Nellermoe chops fruits and vegetables
in the central commissary.

organs, everything. Exactly what cats eat
in the wild.”

Fish, of course, is the diet of sea lions.
Visitors usually gather around the pools of
these animals for the 10:30 am. and 2:30
pm. feedings.

The 200 buys many of the fruits and
vegetables from farmers’ markets. but area
grocers and private citizens donate, too.
Now and then, exotic animals get a taste of
such Southern delicacies as scuppernong
grapes and watermelon.

“There are few animals that won‘t eat
watermelon,” Nellermoe says with a smile.
“Elephants love watermelon. They step on
’em to break ’em.”

Because of the diet and sanitary condi—
tions of the habitats, the zoo seldom has a
sick animal on its hands. So most of the
medicine practiced at the zoo hospital is
preventive or maintenance. Although a
staff veterinarian and technician are on
hand, sometimes area specialists are called
in for treatment. A gynecologist has exam-
ined an elephant, a dentist once performed
a root canal on a lion.

Another reason for the good health of
the animals is the spic-and—span conditions
of the habitats. In the primate habitats for
example, zookeepers wash windows,
sweep ﬂoors, and lay down straw.

One zookeeper spends much of his

day in the exhibit with the animals. For
Richard Elgin, the 200’s elephant trainer,
it’s a job “you really have to want to do.
It’s a lot of work.”

Each day Elgin must clean the quarters
of two African elephant cows, provide
their feed and water, and hose them down.
He also leads them in a brief period of
exercises, such as standing on their hind
legs. That’s entertainment for visitors. but
it’s really meant for exercise and control.

“You have to remind them who‘s boss,”
Elgin explains, “They respond to voice
commands: ‘down,’ ‘come here.’ ‘move
up,’ ‘foot.’ ”

Care of their feet is a major concern.
Elephants in the wild walk some 18 miles
a day. Here, because of the conﬁnes of
the exhibit, Elgin must trim pads and toe-
nails every two weeks and check daily for
foot fungus.

The keepers of Riverbanks Zoo treat
the animals with tender care. But con-
stantly, they must remind themselves that
their charges still smolder with the primi-
tive instincts born of jungle, rain forest.
and African plain.

 

The 200 is open 9 am. to 4 pm. daily
(to 5 pm. on summer weekends), and an
admission of less than $4 per person is
charged. For more information, write the

Gator farms boomin- in Flori

The Associated Press

MIAMI —— Alligators may some-
times bite the hand that feeds them,
but more and more Florida farmers
are willing to take that risk.

“They’ve got a mean tempera-
ment,” says Gatorland Zoo owner
Frank Godwin. “It’s a dangerous
business. One of my employees lost
part of his thumb last year. He was
lucky it wasn’t his hand.”

Nonetheless, some say raising
gators sure beats cattle ranching,
prices being what they are.

In the past few years, the state
has issued licenses to more than
two dozen strictly regulated alliga-
tor farms, and many more applica-
tions are pending, says Maj. Kyle
Hill of the state Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission.

Average start-up costs are about
$50,000, but growers say they ex-
pect profits of up to $300,000 per

1,000 slaughtered alligators.

“It’s going to be a major busi-
ness shortly,” says Clyde Hunt,
whose 20-year-old Hunt’s Alligator
Breeding Ranch near Bushnell,
about 50 miles northeast of Tampa,
is one of the state’s original farms.
“The demand is the highest it’s ever

impressive: up to $350 for a wallet,
$2,000 for shoes or an attache case,
and $1,000 for a purse.

Partygoers sread'

their finest feathers
for zoo fund-raiser

The 1987" “Beastly Feast” last
weekend proved that. Zoo Atlanta
not only has very fine-feathered
friends but also ones who are well-
heeled. -

The $130-per-person dinner
dance raised more than $110,000 for
the zoo, which two years ago
couldn’t drum up enough guests to
support a cocktail party. This year’s
gala sold out early, and the Friends
of Zoo Atlanta scrambled to squeeze
the 570 guests — including special
guests, actress Stefanie Powers
and her mom, Julie Powers, soccer
star Pele and the Count and
Countess Chandon from France
— into the white tent set up near
the bear exhibits.

Men, appropriately enough, in
penguin suits and ladies in glittering
gowns lived up to the party theme:
“Proud as a Peacock.” More than
5,000 feathers were used in the tent
decorations, which included a five-
foot-tall sequined peacock.

Arriving guests were given pea-
cock souvenirs: The men got purple
or turquoise pocket squares, which
they immediately tucked into breast
pockets, and the women received
peacock feathers, which were found
to be handy for tickling friends.

Chairwoman Carolyn Lee Wills
wore a J. Reynolds design - the
‘ turquoise of peacock feathers —
which sprouted from Mrs. Wills’
strapless bodice. Host committee
member June Ray wore one of her
'own creations, another strapless tur-
quoise dress, this one caught up in a
bustle with a purple bow. Long pur-
ple gloves accented her outfit.

Sydeil Harris had a gold and di-
amond elephant peeking from her
dress, and Charlesy Brown decorat-
ed her peacock green skirt with a
peacock pin. Advisory committee
member (and last year’s chair)
Peggy Payne was elegant in a
black silk top whose silver and gold
beads formed the classic peacock
feather design. Joyce Prince joined
the peacock parade when her hus-
band, Bruce, won the drawing for a
gold peacock pendant with emeralds
and sapphires.

Al Gussin wore a necktie of
feathers that no one could resist
stroking -- even though his feathers
were pheasant, not peacock. And

' of Zoo Atlanta, was .kept busy undo-
; ing the rhinestone buttons of her se-

zoned with a sequined elephant.
Gimmicks transformed the zoo
do into more than Atlanta’s stan-
dard charity fare, which is drinks,
then dinner, then dancing. The
schedule was the same. but there
was so much to do that the cocktail

hour lingered on. Guests bid on var-"

ious items, including a four-foot bot-
tle of Meet et Chandon champagne
valued at $600 and signed by Count
Frederic (just call him Fred)
Chandon. {He and his wife, Camil-
la, granddaughter of author Somer-
set Maugham, were obviously guests
who didn't believe in showing up
empty-handed. They brought the
champagne.)

Some Beastly Feasters made the
trek up to catch Starlet and her two
as—yet-unnamed pals in their ele-
phant act. Other guests were fasci-
nated by the male peacock who
obiigingly strutted around and
spread his tail feathers as if on cue.
And everyone was amused by the
lovesick peacock who was mesmer-
ized by his reflection in the bumper
of a Ford Lincoln on display (Ford
was the party’s sponsor).

Miss Powers, who has become
known as an expert on primates and
who lives in Africa much of the
year, was more willing to discuss
her passion — her work with the

William Holden Wildlife Foundation ,

-— than her livelihood —- acting pro-
jects that include several mini-se-
ries and a motion picture.

Overpopulation in Africa is a
time bomb for animals because peo-
ple will take precedence,” she said.
“Is it right for us to take an animal
out of the wild, or is it right for us
to leave them facing extinction with
the loss of habitat?”

When she wasn‘t signing auto-
graphs, Miss Powers was talking
apes with Dr. Frederick King, di-
rector of the Yerkes Primate Center
at Emory University. When some-
one asked him for his autograph, he
was delighted.

(f

Until about three years ago,

management problems, animal

deaths and political meddling had

given the zoo a bad image, and
community supporters stayed away
in ﬂocks. But this year‘s “Beastiy
Feast" was, another feather in the
200’s cap.

Zoo Atlanta is trying to expand
its support throughout Georgia. The
1987 host committee lists names
from 18 counties.

,, ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - May 10, 1987

Hoessle said the most unexpected birth of

' , . late had been that of a black lemur. “We didn’t
think she was expecting, but sure enough, one
day we showed up for work and she had had a

baby," he said. “The male didn’t even know
because he hadn’t bought any cigars.”

Apparently in the animal kingdom, it isn’t
necessary to engage fancy doctors or hospitals
for a delivery because most of the mothers tend
to the details by themselves. Only on rare
occasions are zookeepers needed to assist.

Ulan is one of three Bactrian camels that
delivered a baby a few weeks ago. When Ulan
seemed to be in labor longer than usual, the
zookeepers went into the pen to investigate.
They found one of her baby’s legs to be stuck, so
they straightened it out.

“It was no big deal,” said Bruce Read, curator

i of the large mammals. “We helped her along,
and mother and child were fine after that.”
The baby certainly appeared that way
recently. She had joined her newborn
playmates for what looked like a game of hide-
. and-seek while the adults hung out together,
keeping an eye on the children and catching up
on gossip. Judging from the situation, this herd
clearly had its day-care problems solved.

1 986' -' The proud addax mother - a desert antelope
from North Africa — was still basking in the
glory of her recent delivery when she and her
baby were visited a week ago. “She is an
excellent mother,” Read said. “She was overly
protective with her baby when she was born
and chased away the others so that they
wouldn’t bother the child.”

Read said that typically the other members
of the herd will “check out” the newborn as a
sort of welcoming similar to calls paid to
hospital nurseries. But this addax mom wouldn’t
risk having her baby frightened by the stares of
strangers or, wors'e yet, infected by their nasty
germs. She kept the others away for three days.

In some cases, zookeepers will step in and
isolate the males because they may interfere
with the birth by becoming overly amorous to
the female. Hoessle explained that this
sometimes happens because in the wild, these
animals normally mate after labor.

Not all of the babies born at the zoo spend the
rest of their lives there. Some are traded for
other animals, but only after they have been
fully weaned and are independent of the
mother-child relationship.

The weaning process differs, depending on
the species and individual personality of the
baby animal. Kangaroos, for instance, tend to
be very shy and dependent on their mothers for
the first few months of their lives. They are
content to remain in their mother’s pouches,
where they are nursed, and pop their heads out
from time to time. Then, at 4 months or so, they
start jumping out of the pouch to become
acclimated to their surroundings —— until

something frightens them into jump-

ing back in.

, Two pit bulls square off in a crowded room of an if i
abandoned home The dogs literally try to rip their oppo-

: nent’ s throat out. Inevitably, one of the dogs 1s incapacitated 1

i or killed. And the audience IS delighted.

The pit bull pictured was rounded up from just Such a

- dog fight on Detroit’s northwest side. The people conducting
the fight got away. But this dog and five others were carefully
captured using a 6— foot control stick like the one shown.

' This pit bull’s ears, like those of many others, were
"crudely cut off by his master to prevent opponents from
grabbing hold of him during fights. The fresh wounds and
deep scars all over this dog’s body are graphic evidence of the
growing popularity of dog fighting in Michigan.

In the last 20 years, fans of the so-called sport have
managed to genetically manipulate a strain of pit bull so
aggressive it often attacks without provocation.

Not all pit bulls carry this trait. But the ones specifically
bred for fighting do.

Pit bulls like this one are conditioned to kill— —using live
puppies and kittens 1n bags as bait. They are rewarded for
killing. -

Worst: pit bull attacks aren’t limited to other dogs but
‘ are now increasing among people.

These attacks have prompted one state senator to pro—
pose legislation that would make it a misdemeanor to own a
pit bull. Others have called for complete extermination of the
breed. ,

Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Eliminating the pit
bull won t el1m1nate the problem.

The same people who 1gnore the present felony against
dog fighting would certainly 1gnore a misdemeanor for
owning an outlawed breed. But even if the pit bull were
banished, another dog would be used for this blood sport.

The real blame rests on two legs, not four.

can create problems. Troublesome

cats can be trapped; the capture of
the bothersome ones would only be
confounded by a mandate that all cats
of independence be combed from the
streets and alleys. ‘

The Atlantic magazine points out in
its August edition that U.S. cats now
outnumber U.S. dogs by lit-:3 million to
52 million. The self-sufficient cat has
become the pet of preference for
working couples. _ '

During weekdays on many middle-
class streets in the Tampa Bay area,
the cat census almost certainly ex-
ceeds the count of people, dogs and
squirrels. These people don’t have
cats because the law allows these pets
to roam unleashed. They choose cats
because, as a rule, cats don’t require
leashing -— or much else exceptsome-
thing to eat and drink.

And good leadership requires more
than barking orders in the midst of a
fight. A good leader knows how to win
by avoiding unnecessary skirmishes.
A public hearing on cat leashing
would have brought out the cat ex-
tremists —- both lovers and haters --
in force. Hours would have been wast-

' ed on passionate complaints of mid- . '

night meowing, countered by astound-
ing accounts of meritorious mousing.

After the howling and scratching

stopped, the result would have been

exactly the same. Cats would still be
running free. .
Brown could have said, “Let’s see

what the people think of this cat- ;

DEKALB NEIGHBOR - Decatur (Atlanta) 8/5/87

 

By Scott R. Akin
Neighbor Staff Writer

DeKalb residents may continue to
keep pit bull terriers as pets after
the county Board of Commissioners
refused last week to consider ban-
ning the breed, fearing the ban
would be unconstitutional.

“It’s not a question of constitur

tionality,” according to Com-
missioner John Evans, who at-
, tempted to bring up the proposed
. ban for consideration. “I think the
whole issue is whether we feel the
concern of human beings as opposed
to dogs.”

The motion to consider the ban
was made during the commission’s
regular business meeting July 28
and was defeated by a 5-2 vote. Only
Comissioners Evans and Brince
Manning voted in favor of consider-
ing the ban.

, “Based on all the incidents in the

’ county and across the country, we
have an obligation to deal with the

situations being put to us,” Evans '

said.

Maintaining there is a need for a
ban, Evans said the pit bulls have
demonstrated they are capable of
killing and maiming and com-
mission action is needed before
more incidents occur.

The vote came after the com-
mission had considered information
compiled by DeKalb Animal Control
on the number of dog attacks in the

county by each breed.

' Pit bulls have been involved in
,j only two reported biting incidents so
i, far this year.

The latest attack occurred July 15
when Mary Merelino, 71, of 5040
Antebellum Drive in Stone Moun-
tain, received about 100 stitches at
DeKalb General Hospital after a pit
bull knocked her down and bit her
legs, throat and torso.

Mixed breeds account for the
most of the biting incidents —— 63 ~-
and German shepherds have been
involved in 40 biting incidents, the
second highest number. Chows have
been involved in 14 biting incidents,
and dobermans have been involved
in nine. .

In cases with multiple bites,
mixed shepherd breeds account for
the most incidents -— nine. German
shepard incidents total six,
doberman incidents number five and

- there were three pit bull incidents.

The statistics indicate neighbors
of pet owners are victims about
twice as often as pet owners or the

. owners’ guests.

Last year there were a total of 264
reported biting incidents, while
from January to June 1987, there

have already been a total of 257

biting incidents.

The statistics, however, do not
indicate the population of each
breed in the county or a ratio of
biting occurrences to breed popu-
lation.

An outline of the severity of
injuries sustained by victims was

also neglected, but injuries sus-

tained in attacks from pit bulls tend
to be more severe because of the
breed’s strong jaw, according to
Sgt. H.L. Pearson of DeKalb Animal

In addition, no other breed in the
county besides pit, .bulls has been
reported to have killed its victim, he
said.

DeKalb’s 4-month-old animal con-
trol ordinance will continue as the
only regulation of pets and includes

defining a “dangerous animal” as .

one “which constitutes a physical
threat to human beings or other

domestic animals by virtue of a'
known propensity to endanger life'

by an unprovoked assault or bite so
as to cause serious bodily harm.”

" Replace
" Control Of
Our Strays

Like many other outraged citizens, I 7

am deeply concerned about the situation
at Hillsborough Animal Control where a
Doberman was left in a truck in Florida’s
extreme heat to die a pitiful death.

I am not an attorney, but even from a
layman’s perspective it would appear
that there are two state-level violations
regarding cruelty to animals and confine-
ment of animals.

In View of past violations regarding .'
cruelty to animals, we cannot possibly. ‘_
expect a concerned public to tolerate this

or let it happen again. Too many animals
have suffered already.

I suggest that, the-operation of Hills-
borough Animal Control be turned over
to the Humane Society of Hillsborough
County with appropriate funding for hu-
mane animal care. ' V

The excuse of lack of funds for ani-

mal care is not substantiated in this situa-
tion. As a pet owner, I cannot afford air
conditioning for my pets, much as I
would like to. However, the law demands
from me that I provide them with ample
shelter, shade, sufficient water, and keep
them in an acceptable environment to as-
sure their health and safety. The same
concept of law is applicable to Animal
Control and it is the responsibility of
Hillsborough County commissioners to
see that it is complied with accordingly.
The thirst of that poor unfortunate
animal must havebeen terrible even if
he/she had been discovered the next

', day, but two days is inexcusable. We as a

supposedly civilized community simply "
i cannot tolerate such outrages. ‘

Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough

Atlanta, Ga 30345

Dear Connie:

,

Thank you for your letter and the newspaper editorials about the
National Forest Service's management policies and H.R. 1516, the
Tongass Timber Reform Act, which was introduced by Representative
Mrazek. _

The Forest Service develops a management plan for each National
Forest every ten years. Before each plan is finalized, a substantial
amount of input is offered by various groups, including conserva-
tionists, timber industry officials, Congress and the public at large.
This process, which was not mentioned in the Boston Globe editorial
you sent, has worked well to balance the operation of federal timber
harvests and forest management in the past, and I believe the open
review process will insure protection of National Forests in the

future.

Since 1944, federal law has required that the Forest Service
maintain the sustained yield of timber in National Forests. To . .
achieve that goal, the agency can never out down more trees than it IS

growing.

Be assured that I will monitor the actions of the Forest Service
to insure that the agency manages our natural resources wisely.

With regard to H.R. 1516, this legislation is now pending in the
Subcommittee on Energy and the Environment of the House Committee on
Interior and Insular Affairs. Hearings on the bill were held May 19th

and let.

I must study this measure more closely and will take into account
the information you have provided. I am glad to have this material
and hope to review the issue in greater detail should H.R. 1516 be
considered by the full House.

Queen Elizabeth II astride a roy-

saddle than Mystic Dukes, 7, who
trades her wheelchair for a horse on
Saturdays at the Reece Center for
Handicapped Horsemanship.

Lines employee and Shrine clown,
who, along with about 60 other peo-
ple, donates his time to the center.

“It’s educational, recreational
and therapeutic,” he said. ~

But perhaps the greatest value of
the riding lessons is the increased
self-esteem, parents say.

“Jenny has found her little niche
here,” said Beth Perez of her 14-

was born with spina bifida. “It has
given her a lot of confidence she

the cost of insurance, Wheeler said.

Mississippi sandhill cranes
reared in captivity have successful-
ly mated with cranes in the wild for
the first time, inspiring hope among
wildlife experts that the endangered
birds can be saved by restocking.

So far this year, three gangly,
tawny-orange crane hatchlings have
been seen following their parents
into the wire grass and pine flat-
lands of the Mississippi bayou coun-
try where the endangered cranes
nest. "

At least one chick is the off-
spring of a wild crane and a former
captive crane - the first fruit of a
20-year-old program designed to re-
plenish wild stocks of the birds with
members of the same subspecies
bred at a wildlife research center in
Maryland.

, The young bird is the first evi-
dence that captive sandhill cranes

retain enough of their native behav-

_ ior to survive and breed in the wild.

.a..

 

Three nests built by mixed pairs
of the cranes at the Mississippi
Sandhill Crane National Wildlife
Refuge, near Pascagoula, Miss, are
among a record number of 11 nests
discovered this year —- more than .
double last year’s total. a,

Fewer than 60 Mississippi sand-
hill cranes remain in the wild today.
The number dropped from about
100 in 1949 to around 30 in 1977.

In an effort to reverse the de-
cline, in the 19603 U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service biologists began

nests in the area.

The eggs were sent to the Pa-

' tuxtent Wildlife Research Center in

Maryland, where other varieties of
sandhill cranes hatched and raised
the Mississippi chicks. .

In 1981, the first batch of juve-
nile Patuxtent cranes were taken,
back to Mississippi and released in
the 18,000-acre refuge. Nearly half
of the 45 Patuxtent cranes released
since then survive in the wild. Re-
searchers hope eventually to build a

‘p

self-sustaining population of at least i
100 cranes at the Mississippi refuge.
Although wildlife officials have
suspected that the wild birds and
the formerly captive stock had bred
before, this year’s nesting season is l.
Vithe first to produce documented evi-
dence of successful mixed matings. 3
“We’re happy they’re breeding
ﬁat all,” says Dr. Jim Carpenter, re-
tsearch veterinarian at Patuxtent. :

TIMES HERALD - July 30, 1987

When couples split,
family pooch gets
tangled in tug of war

By Michael Quintanilla
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

FTER A TWO-year marriage,
Robert and Susan Hall got a di-
vorce and divided a houseful of
beginners’ belongings. He got the
modest living room furniture. She kept
the color TV. He stayed with the car. She
took the dishes. But when it came to
Asha — a pooch given to the couple on
their wedding day — the divorce literally
turned into a dogfight. _

A dachshund with big, sad eyes, Ash
became a dog of war in a canine custody
dispute that cost $1,000 in court fees to
settle, says Susan, a Dallas resident who
has since remarried.

“He wanted the dog and I wanted the
dog. We had to take the matter to court,”
she says. Susan won the case. But despite
her disapproval, the judge awarded her
ex-husband visitation rights. Like clock-
work, every other Friday at 7 p.m., Rob-
ert showed up at his ex-wife’s front door
to take Asha from her arms. Meanwhile,
Susan says she could hardly wait to be
reunited with the pet at 7 p.m. Sunday —
Robert’s doggy deadline.

“Asha was my baby,” says Susan, who
also won custody of her son, Bobby.

The Halls’ custody fight for their dog of

. divorce .—.-— a rarity in courtrooms where
the best interests of a child are usually at
.stake —— is not an isolated case. While
‘most divorce cases involving pet custody
"are negotiated out of court, occasionally a

i good ﬁght for Fido will make headlines.

tS'uch was the case last week when a
Nashville judge decided a divorced cou-
ple would split custody of their 4-year-old
,mixed Doberman—Labrador after neither
husband nor wife would budge on the
matter. Neither spouse was ecstatic over

the arrangement, but each wanted their
dog, Aristotle, badly enough to comply
with the judge’s ruling.

In Dallas, dogs-of—divorce custody cases
rarely go to trial, says Judge Merrill Hart- ‘
man of the 303rd Family District Court.

Still, Hartman, lawyers, psychologists and ,

animal behaviorists agree pet owners will .
go to great lengths to negotiate custody of
a dog —— including visitation rights, doggy

._ --_

T; ,. support payments and even the company

i it keeps — because of the special
j bonding humans have with man’s
best friend,

A few weeks ago Hartman pre-
sided at a divorce hearing where
g stody of a schnauzer was given

‘to the husband. The Wife agreed
to a weekend visitation plan
where the dog was to be taken to
her parents’ house and left there
an hour before she came to pick
it up.

“She wanted to maintain her
relationship with the dog, not her
husband,” Hartman says.

Lonnie Moore, a Dallas veteri-
narian and chairman of the North
Texas Veterinary Public Informa-
tion Program, says that kind of
emotional bonding is similar to
the relationship a parent has with
a child. Familiar with dogs—of-
divorce cases, Moore says in in—
stances where a couple has no
children to ﬁght over, custody
of a canine will be fought dog-

mOn the surface it seems pecu-
‘fliar that people would go to great
lengths to gain custody of a dog,”
says Robert Gordon, a Dallas psyi
chologist. “After all, they could
go out and get another dog the
day following the divorce. How-
ever, it’s not peculiar when you
consider the love a pet owner has

with a dog, because people that .

love their dogs will also miss
them, worry about them and
their care, and will have the dog’s
best interests at hand. Why? Be-
cause a dog gives its owners un-
conditional love.”

Gordon says a joint—custody ar—
rangement involving a dog that is
loved by a spouse or the entire
family “makes psychological
sense.”

Bonnie Beaver, an animal be-
haviorist at Texas A&M Universi—
ty, says a divorced individual
seeking joint custody or at least a
continuing relationship with a
dog has put the pooch “in the
role of a human family member
and wants to share interaction

1"

witii‘: that pet even ar‘ter a divorce.

To not have that interaction is as v

if the pet has died and that can
be traumatic for an individual.”

. Such is the case with Maureen
and George Norsig who divorced
six months ago after a 12—year
marriage. Though the couple nev-
er had children, Sherlock, a Bed-
lington terrier became a major
part of their lives after they
bought the dog during their first
year of marriage. Sherlock lived
with the couple in New York City

and later in Mexico City before

:they moved to Dallas. Today,

Maureen has custody of Sherlock
and a second dog, Sabrina, which
the couple acquired later in their
marriage. -

Maureen, who moved into a
new house last week in North
'Dallas, says custody of the dogs
never really was discussed at the
time of the divorce back in Janu«

ary. “It was an unspoken agree-’

ment that I would keep the
dogs,” she says.

George, a management consul—
tant director with McKinsey &
Co., says his ex-wife “paid the
price to keep the dogs. She took
care of them more than I did.”
Still, George says he will main—
tain his friendship with the dogs,
particularly Sherlock, his favorite.
When Maureen makes a trip to
Florida later this summer, George
will dog sit.

Maureen says George’s concern
for Sherlock when the dog re-
cently underwent treatment for
an acute liver infection was the
mark of a true friend, .1,”

She wanted to maintain her rel ' °
. ationshi .
With the dog, not her husband.’ p

Judge Merrill Hartman
' “He paid for Sherlock’s bills I

', no questions asked,” says Mau- ,‘

reen of George’s generosity in,-

footing the $1,500 bill. “It was,»

touching. He was calling for med-j
ical updates on Sherlock or he
would have his secretary call to
find out how Sherlock was doing.
He and Sherlock have 'a bond
that will last forever, even though
we’re divorced.” '

Says George: “Sherlock and I 1
have been friends for 12 years. I ;
see characteristics of courage and .
in Sherlock. Even j.

warmth
though Maureen and I are di—
vorced, I feel I have a certain re-
sponsibility to help a good friend
like Sherlock.”

Divorced for three months,
Darilynn Sorrels says she kept
the family’s dog, Booger, an 80—
pound Australian shepherd, de—
spite her ex—husband’s wishes to
take the dog with him to his
mother’s house after they split

11 .

p“He wanted to take Booger af-
ter the divorce. But I said, ‘No.
He stays here with the chil-
dren,’ ” recalls Darilynn. “My ex
never threatened to keep the dog,
but he visits with the dog when
he visits the kids.”

Jerry Hughes, a Dallas attor-
ney, has handled many a divorce
where pets were “extremely im—
portant to both parties,” he says.
Still, Hughes says there was the

‘by the divorcing m1

‘ . "ﬂ“... ._ W .. , _‘ .. . .
case of the Pomeranian whose
-i ownership could not be resolved

'ddle-aged '
couple.

“Neither would give in. They
were both determined to keep it.
Finally they decided if neither
could have full custody of the
dog, neither would keep it,” he
says. So, in the best interests of
the dog. the couple agreed to give
it to their adult daughter vvl'ie
lived in another state.

Divorce attorney Domingo Gar-
cia says divorcing couples occa-
sionally instigate a, canine-custo-
dy case just to spite a spouse or
to use the pet as a bargaining tool
for property. .

“I’ll never forget the French
poodle case. My gut reaction was
that the husband was doing it to
get back at the wife. In the end,
the judge awarded custody to the
wife. She broke down and cried
during the hearing and professed
her love and affection for the
dog,” Garcia says.

When such disputes become
doWnright dirty, shelters may get
involved. says Jennifer Orme, an

associate with the American Hu-

mane Association. “We had a hus-
band in a divorce dispute who
had .the family’s dogs euthan-‘
ized,” recalls Orme. “And often, a
spouse in a divorce will take the
dog to a shelter to get revenge.
For Carol Cobb, who was di-
vorced five years ago, a fight to
the finish would have occurred if

her w‘exx‘glhus‘band hadﬁpuzshed it

 

Maureen Norsig kept the family’s Bedlington terriers after her divorce.

BOSTON GLOBE - August 2,1987

Vermont center is haven for injured

birds

By Yvonne Daley
Special to the Globe

WOODSTOCK, Vt. - “Whoooo
cooks for you? Whoooo cooks for
you all?" Sarah Laughlin, director
of the Vermont Institute of Natu-
ral Science in Woodstock, asks the
barred owl. imitating his oft-re-
peated call.

, The owl, perched high in his

ﬂight cage, clicks his beak once
and turns his head away. He’s
had enough socializing for one
day.

This owl is one'of more than 40
magnificent birds of prey housed
at the institute’s Vermont Raptor
Center. the largest living museum
of its kind in North America,
which opens to the public this
weekend.

On display here are 26 species
of raptors, or birds of prey, includ-
ing several endangered species.
Among these are peregrine fal-
cons, a golden and a bald eagle
and the tiniest predator in ”the
Northeast, the three-ounce saw-
whet owl.

These birds were saved from
death from injuries sustained in
the wild. Man is their major en-
emy. Most of the injuries were the
result of collisions with'auto-
mobiles or gunshot wounds.

Many were restored to health
at the institute’s rehabilitation
hospital-or other rehabilitation
centers across the country. But
because of their injuries, they
could not survive if they were re—
leased,

Flight cages constructed

The birds are housed in ﬂight
cages especially designed by Kath-
erine McKeever, founder and di-
rector of the Owl Rehabilitation
Research Foundation in Ontario,
Canada. The large cages. built
into the hillsides surrounding the
institute’s educational center out-
side the village of Woodstock, are
constructed with as little distur-
bance of the natural woodland en-
vironment as possible.

Each cage is also designed with
a particular species' natural needs
in mind. Thus. there are hollowed-
out trees for the secretive, long-
eared ow] to hide in during the day
and flight tunnels for the Ameri-
’ can kestril, with its distinctive
blue markings. to fly through.
Birds that cant ﬂy because of
j their injuries are provided with a
Series of ramps to allow them to
move around. .

The raptor center has been a
long- -time dream of Laughlin and
other institute staff since the non-
profit, private foundation was
founded in 1972. McKeever has
also been involved in the project
since the beginning. At her Ontar«
io center, she restores many birds,
brought in by private citizens or
Canadian officials, to health. She
said she has long desired a place
where permanently damaged
birds could be displayed for educa-
tional purposes.

‘ “But this raptor center goes far
beyond being a display for the
public,” McKeever said at opening
ceremonies Thursday. “Here there
is consideration given to the qual-
ity of life of these birds in prison.
It is a prison, make no mistake
about that, but this prison is an
alternative to death, and apleas-
ant alternative at that.”

Funds for the $80,000 project
came entirely from donations. The
project took five years in planning
and building.

Since 1972, the Vermont insti
tute has treated more than 200 in-
jured birds annually, more thar.
half of which have been returnec'
to the wild. Those that cannot be
freed are used for breeding or edu-
cational purposes;

Breeding program

The institute has been instru:
mental. for example, in breeding
peregrines in the effort to reintro—
duce this bird to its natural habi-
tat after DDT and other pesticides
caused its extinction in the East
in the 19605. As of this year, four
wild pairs of peregrines were nest-
ing in Vermont alone.

It usually takes a few months
for birdsbrought to the center to
adjust to their new surroundings.
Many species are not comfortable
enough to breed in captivity for at
least two or three years, Laughlin
said. The ultimate compliment to
the center was paid recently by a
pair of great gray owls who mated
and produced an egg just four
months after captivity.

The golden eagle housed came
from a Wildlife center in Virginia
in June. It had been shot in Febru-
ary 1986 and had a badly broken
wing. The eagle can hold its wing
in thenormal ﬂight position but
cannot ﬂy.

The immature female bald ea-
gle was found with a broken left
elbow on Cape Cod and treated at
the wildlife clinic of Tufts Univer-

 

‘Here there is con-
sideration given to '
the quality of life of
these birds in pris-
on. It is a prison,
make no mistake
about that, but this
prison is an alter-
native to death,
and a pleasant al-
ternative at that.

- KATHERINE MCKEEVER

sity Veterinary School before com-
ing to the raptor center last Octo-
ber. .

“This is a labor of love,” said

Laughlin. “People aren‘t familiar

with the word raptor and some
have heard of us and thought we

were a rapture center. We do feel ..
quite ecstatic — one could say rap- '

turous — about this project."

Pit Bullterriers: _
Dogs Bred To Kill

 

Washington

A pit bullterrier
named Gadhafi
goes berserk at the Neal

sight of another Peirce

dog, strains at his __
leash, bites his own The Washington Post
tongue, sprays sa-
liva and blood. An-

 

 

 

 

other psyched-out pit bull is so keen to attack it tries:

to chew its way through a chain-link fencé.’

And a street, dude named Eric tells about the litter ’
of eight young pit bulls he’s raising. Only eight

weeks old, they’re already —- literally — at each
other’s throats. ‘
When my photographer colleague Shepard Sher-

bell came back from Baltimore’s Liberty Hill'
neighborhood with those reports last week, I decided *
this was one urban story I was happy to learn of ~

secondhand.

But what of the pit bulls? Can this summer’s wave

of horror stories be passed off as media hype?
Hardly. Pit bulls have inﬂicted 21 of the nation’s 29
fatal canine attacks since 1983. Fourteen of the

victims have been children under 6 years of age."

Each story of a mutilated youngster’s body, torn by

the vice-like jaws that close with 1,800 pounds of ;
pressure, ripping off flesh with sure intent to kill, is -

more appalling than the last.

And for each fatality, there are dozens of other

pit-bull attacks that leave victims with lifetime
scars, physical and psychological.
This wave of terror stalking American streets can

only worsen. There’s an explosion of pit-bull?
breeding in ghettoes and barrios where idle,‘

embittered youth have chosen the animals as
“macho” status symbols, to fight and wager on. In

Philadelphia, the pit-bull count has soared from 25
to 4,000 in five years. Time magazine reports the .
animals are often fed gunpowder or hot sauces to ,

make them mean, live kittens to sharpen their taste
for blood.

Dogfighting is a felony in 36 states. But the husky
pit bulls, trained to fight to the death, are being
matched across the nation. "It’s getting way out of
hand, man,” a pit-bull breeder told the Los Angeles.
Times. "Compton, Inglewood, Bakersfield, Hesperia.
there are at least three to four matches every
week, 6- to 10-card fights.”

The Humane Society of the United States reports '
that many pit bulls involved in attacks on humans
had been bred and trained for dogfights. . '

Pit bulls have become for many drug dealers the
weapon of choice — legal but more terrorizing than "
guns, ideal for holding police at bay while an illegal
stash disappears down a toilet.

Baltimore police officer Bert Ricasa relates how a
pit bull attacked and hit him four times as he tried to:
arrest a suspected narcotics dealer. Ricasa was able
- to draw his service revolver and pump several shots,
point blank, into the dog as it dug its teeth into his

ZONA REPUBLIC - Phoenix - July 31, 1987

thigh. But a colleague had to club the dying dog on
the head and then use a nightstick to pry its .jaws
loose. Rushed to the emergency room, Ricasa
required 400 stitches.

Who are these Rambos of the dog world? The
answer: A breed descended from the fighting
bulldogs of 19th century England, known .as
American pit bullterriers or American Staffordshire
terriers. Some say they were originally bred for
bear-baiting. They are some 700,000 to 1 million in .
the United States. " .

Dog-owner groups and kennel clubs argue pit bulls
aren’t the problem. They say it’s humans who breed
and raise the animals improperly. They echo the
National Rifle Association claim that people kill, not
the guns or the dogs. .

The argument is facile, but fallac10us. The .sole
function of handguns is killing. And bullterriers,
however amiable they appear, have a mark of Cam:
in their genetic history: They were firstbred not to
retrieve game or herd sheep, but to kill in ﬁerce
combat. Increasingly inbred and misused, more Will
likely turn out to be hair-trigger killers. Why
shouldn’t concerned neighbors and city counCils seek
curbs? .

Because, claim defenders, bloodlines are so mined
there’s no scientiﬁcally valid way to prove just which
dog is a pit bull. The very thought of bans smacks, _
they say, of "canine racism.” Torrance, Calif,
council members considering a ban were accused of
“attempting to do to pit bulls the same thing Hitler
did to the Jews in Germany.” _

But it’s the rare owner who doesn’t know the "
breed’s killer history. Dogs aren’t entitled to
constitutional protections. Anyone’s legal right to
own a dangerous dog has to stop short of his
neighbor’s throat. The real question is what kinds of
curbs will (1) restrain truly wild dogs and (2) stand

up in court? _

Here the dog clubs, backed by the Humane
Society, have a good argument: Instead of Singling
out pit bulls, states and localities should strengthen
their "dangerous-dog” ordinances. Typically, the
laws require special registration, bonds and liability
insurance when a dog of any breed has a history of
biting. On a second Offense the animal can be
confiscated and the owner fined or imprisoned. .

A model “dangerous-dog” bill, just passed in
Washington state, goes further. Even before bites of
humans are recorded, it makes a dog’s aggresswe or .
intimidating behavior, including attacks on other
animals, a trip wire for special controls. ”

There is real question whether “dangerous-dog
ordinances will deter many of the back—alley types
now breeding pit bulls for ill purpose. Or that the
laws will stop rural thugs like the bunch in. Grants
Pass, Ore., recently found to have 25 pit bulls
Chained around their 2,345-plant marijuana farm. .

But South Pasadena dog owners made a .SOlld
point in a recent letter to the editor: “We Americans
must be the only people in the industrialized world
who stoically watch free-roaming dogs ravage. trash
cans, terrorize children, scare off natural Wildlife,
reproduce rampantly, kill lawns with urine and turn _
sidewalks into mine fields of feces.”

U.S. animal-control laws are a neglected mess.

I The pit~bull attacks fit a pattern of laxness. The

‘ message to local governments is clamp down —— not
. later, but now.

 




DENVER POST

Denver Post Staff Writer

Destruction of wildlife charges

have been filed against the gener- " t'

at manager at a Frisco condomin-
ium complex in the deaths of
about 200 baby swallows who died
when their nests were destroyed.

Alex Chappell, district wildlife
manager for the Colorado Divi-
sion of Wildlife, said Wednesday
that Robert Haussrnan, who man-
ages Mountainside condos for
The Managers firm, could be
fined more than $5,100 if found
guilty.

A 14-year-old Mountainside res-
ident, Jennifer J ako, rescued 23
of the cliff swallows, including
four from a dumpster, after her
younger sisters tearquy told her
that workers Monday had knock-
ed down about 100 nests from the
sides of several buildings. .

Workers hired by the manage-
ment company removed the nests
apparently after receiving com-
plaints about bird droppings and
concern about possible damage to
the condos’ brick walls, Chappell
said.

All over grounds

“They were all over the
grounds,” Jennifer said of the
fallen birds. “I found four in the
dumpster huddled together with
several other dead birds. Most of
' them were in shock and were try-
tag to hide in any nook or cranny
near the buildings.”

J ako 5 mother, Violet, said her
' youngest daughters, Sherry, 10,
and Jessica, 7, ran into the house
‘ crying, “They’re killing the birds.
Why are they killing the birds?”

The surviving birds were put
under a heat lamp and fed cat

July 30, 1987

to the wildlife division on Tues-

day. Carol Trout, who is licensed

i by the division to care for injured
; animals, is caring for the baby

Ban Pull Teeth

Other Breeds Dangerous, Too
Editor:

Recently, articles have appeared concerning the
aggressive nature of pit bulls. From these articles
one would gather that these dogs are not to be
allowed a place here in the metro area with their
owners. ,

We would like to relate that we have personally
had friends and relatives who own pit bulls, and
we’ve never felt uncomfortable with them nor have
they ever threatened us in any way. On the
contrary, we have found them to be fun-loving,
affectionate and extremely gentle dogs. .

On the other hand, we’ve had acquaintances
with German shepherds and chows who actually
had their dogs turn on them. :

For whatever reasons a dog may become '
aggressive — it is not exclusively just one :
particular breed, but more, in fact, a nature of
animals in general. q‘

Extract Powerful Front Teeth
Editor: .
Enacting a ban of pit bulls is a very difﬁcult
thing to do because many dog lovers do not want to
part with their pets. I suggest that the law require
anyone owners of pit bulls to have the dangerous
front teeth extracted. This would make the dog
unable to kill and maim people and other pets. It,
probably would mean they would be on a soft diet,‘
but that would be better then losing a dear pet. I

Government trapper becomes *

ranchers can’t brush off as just another

His name pops up frequently in environ-

Richard Leroy Randall was born in 1924
in the little Wyoming town of Powell, the
son of a service station owner and a music

On the winter rides, Randall broke the
monotony by observing the animals and
trapping a few for ea‘c income. A Fish and
Wildlife Service agent, impressed with his
wildlife savvy, suggested that Randall be—

So he slaughtered coyote pups in their

began to blur badly.

DEAR DALLAS

Chuma-the okapi
* embarks on goodwill
trip to San Diego ‘

By Toni Giovanettl
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

If it were a movie, they’d call it “Chuma
Does San Diego.”

The Dallas Zoo is lending one of its rar-
est animals, an okapi, to the San Diego
‘Wild Animal Park. An estimated 52 of
these large animals -'-- they look like a
croSs between a horse and a giraffe ——— are

' held in captivity.

“They’re one of the most valuable 200
animals -—- almost impossible to get,” says
Victoria Furber, public relations spokes—
‘W0man for the Dallas Zoo. “We consider
them priceless.”

The Dallas Zoo and zoos worldwiderpar—

ticipate in a breeding program to keep the

captive animals from dying out, says Joe
Christman, mammal zoologist at the Dallas
Zoo. Through the lending program, the
gene pool is revived within zoos. Though
okapis. are thought to be common in Zaire,
political. turmoil in that country has kept
scientists from successfully tracking,
studying or capturing the animals, he says.

Chuma, 2, is one of six okapis in Dallas,
all born in captivity from a pair of okapis

that were captured in Zaire (then theBel~ .

gium Congo) and shipped to the zoo in

1960. He is one of the gentlest of the,

bunch and shy around strangers, though
he Will gingerly lick their arms for the salt
producedby sweat. His giraffelike tongue
feels sandpapery. Although Chuma’s hinds
are striped like a zebra, Christman says ze-
bras have full hooves, unlike the okapi’s
split hooves.

“They look like an animal designed by a

committee,” Christman says. .
Scratching the okapi’s velvety fur on its

back, Christman says Chuma had a viral

infection shortly after birth, so he had

more human contact than the other okapis.

The ,staff veterinarian, Dr. Bonnie Ra-
phael, checked Chuma for fevers day and
night and had to give him ice baths to save
his life. '

“Because he’s so well-trained, he’s a‘ big
baby,” Christman says.

The animal was led into a crate, driven
to Dallas- Forth Worth International Airport
and flown on a chartered jet to San Diego
Tuesday night.

Chuma will stay in the park for an indef-
inite period.

Anyone who has read Dian

Anyone who has also seen Hazel

knows that these animals are

- terribly unhappy. It’s no surprise

that they won’t breed; history is
full of examples of the cessation of
breeding when intelligent beings
are placed in concentration camps
or otherwise subjugated. It’s as if
they know that their young should
not be born into such a life.
It saddens me deeply to belong to
a species which shows so little
sophistication and knowledge about

BRONX BENEFICIARYrYong Yong, one of two pandas on loan from China to the Bronx Zoo, eats arrow bamboo
that is grown in Georgia. A research center near Savannah is the country’s only major supplier of the bamboo.

Zoo Atlanta fears shortage of food supply.

 

By David Corvette
Staff Writer

 

SAVANNAH — If Zoo Atlanta
succeeds in obtaining a pair of giant"

pandas from China, it plans to feed
them with Georgia bamboo raised
in Chatham County. .

But unless a University of Geor-
gia extension station here expands

production of the pandas’ favorite

food, Zoo Atlanta officials will have
to scramble to find another food
source for the voracious herbivores.

“My suggestion to them is to
grow more — now,” urged zoo Di-
rector Terry Maple.

The Coastal Area Extension Re-
search Center, located on a former
plantation about 15 miles south of
Savannah, is the country’s only ma-
jor supplier of the arrow bamboo
preferred by giant pandas, said su-
perintendent Charles Bruce.

Since April, the research center
has been donating bamboo to a pair
of giant pandas on loan to the
Bronx Zoo in New York. The Geor-
gia bamboo also is shipped to lesser
pandas at zoos in Minneapolis, Oma-

LeS‘ser pandas are smaller, raccoon-like

The country’s two most famous giant
pandas, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing at
the National Zoo in Washington, eat
more fruit and vegetables than bamboo.

Officials there said enough bamboo is
grown around Washington. to feed the '

pandas. ' .

The Bronx pandas have been stuffing
themselves with 300 pounds of arrow
bamboo a week, wiping out the research
center’s only stand of arrow among its
20 acres of bamboo. A supply found on a

nearby landowner’s preperty is expected,

to last only another six weeks.

“We’re proud that bamboo is being
transported to New York from the state
of Georgia,” Maple said. “We just hope
they’re not eating us out of it.” ~

Zoo Atlanta has been negotiating
with the Chinese government for the
past six months to obtain a panda exhib-
it for the 200’s centennial observance in
1989, Maple said. Zoo officials are hop-
ing for a layorable reply within a week.

“We have President Carter interven—
ing in our behalf, and he tells me we
have a good chance of it happening,”
Maple said. ‘

But a ready supply of bamboo is cru-"
cial to keeping the pandas plump and,

happy in Atlanta.

“There’s a bit of an art when it.

comes to feeding animals,” Maple said.

-“With these animals you often get food

preferences. Without [the bamboo], they
could suffer a dietary insufficiency.”

Even though bamboo —- a member
of the grass family —- is one of the fast-
est-growing plants in the world, the ten-
der shoots and leaves preferred by the
picky pandas are produced only three
weeks out of the year, during April and
May, Bruce said.

Between growth seasons, the bamboo
is cut down with chain saws on Monday
and Thursday afternoons. It is packed in

gladiolus boxes and delivered to the Sae

vannah airport to be flown to the pandas
in time for supper the next day, Bruce
said.

The three zoos with lesser pandas
each receive about 50 pounds of bamboo

every three weeks, but the giant pandas .

eat nearly 20 times that amount, Bruce
said. For a while the giant pandas were
eating several of the estimated 65 spe-
cies of bamboo grown at the research
center, but for the past few weeks they
have touched nothing but arrow bamboo.

“We’ll send it as long as we have it,”
Bruce said, “so they’ll either have to do

without it or get it from somewhere

else. But I don’t know of any other [ma-
jor] plantings of arrow bamboo in the
country.”

Frank Linton, an agriculture re-
search assistant who supervises the pana

 

' (la-feeding program, said the research

center should be able to keep up with
the bears’ ravenous appetites until their
scheduled departure for Beijing in

- September.

“Our supply of bamboo will be way
up,” Linton said. Once the bamboo
stands begin shooting again next spring,
the plants will grow at the staggering
rate of 18 inches 3 day, he said, reaching _

' a height of 50 feet in some cases.

Before the Universit System took
over in 1982, the researc center ,was a
US. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
plant introduction station. - .

Beginning in the 19203, USDA plant
explorers traveled the world to bring
back plants they thought might be useful
in the United States. Bamboo was plant-

‘ed in hopes of making it a commercial

source of paper pulp, Bruce said. Now
the tall grass is grown primarily for
landscaping, and occasionally to feed
pandas. ~.

Three young peregrine falcons.

were flown by helicopter to Mount
Yonah in North Georgia on Monday,
where wildlife officials h0pe they
will re-establish their breed in the
state. They will be cared for by two
college interns until they are able to
care for themselves. '
The falcons, also known as duck

hawks,lwere provided by Zoo Atlan-

‘ta for a project that is a coopera-_

tive effort involving the zoo, the
Georgia Department of Natural Re-
sources (DNR) and the US. Forest
Service.

Zoo Atlanta Director Terry Ma-

'jple called the project “a new mile-

stone” for the zoo. Maple said the
falcon effort illustrates the fact that

wildlife” but are more frequently
w'orking toward conservation

Ron Odom, a senior biologist for the
DNR. “Urban sites have worked out

quite well” elsewhere, he said.

The peregrine falcon, one of

' about 37 species of the genus falco

found throughout the world, at one
time nested in Georgia. None has
lived in the state since the late
19303 or early 19405, although fal-
cons migrate through Georgia, wild-
life officials say.

The three 6-week- old birds will
be fed and supervised for three
weeks by two college interns em-
ployed by the Department of Natu-
ral Resources. Then the birds will
be released into the wild, where
they will live along cliffs in the
mountains.

The interns, Suzanne Senchak,
22, and Miranda Stephens, 23, will

feed dead quail to the young birds“

of prey, which are being reared» in a
nesting box perched atop a 40-foot
cliff. In a week, the falcons will be

allowed to roam from the box. As

they gather their strength, they will
learn to hunt for themselves.

Ms. Senchak and Ms. Stephens
will spend daylight hours behind a
blind on the rock face, observing
and photographing the young fal-
cons. They will wear safety ropes
tied to a tree.

“This is big-time bird watch-
ing,” said Ms. Senchak, a graduate

“The question has taken up

more recently, as Spuds MacKen-
zie, the “party dog" in TV beer
commercials.

The animals weigh 40 to 60-
pounds and have powerful chest,
neck and jaw muscles.

Devoted owners say the dogs
are smart and affectionate. But
the breeds have a sinister reputa-
tion. Bred over centuries for dog
fighting, a vicious sport that is
now illegal, pit bulls are tena-
cious, aggressive animals.

They are considered dangerous
because of their tendency to lock
onto a victim with their powerful
jaws.

“Other dogs will eventually
quit an attack, whereas pit bulls
continue to fight,” said Donald
Clifford, director of lab animal
medicine at the Medical College of
Ohio. “You read how once they
lock onto a little kid, its goodbye
little kid. They don’ t injure you a
little bit. They continue to drill
in.’

Moreover, problems associated
with pit bulls are exacerbated by
some of their owners, according to
Michael Ushijima, general counsel
for the 200,000—member American

‘Dog Owners Association. Many
owners, including drug. dealers,
are attracted to the breed by its

reputation of toughness, and train 1

the dogs to be vicious.

"The problem is not with

American pit bullterriers, it's with

jerks and idiots who own them,” ,

Ushijima said. “If they eliminated

this breed, the jerks would turn to .

another one.”

Md. Bald Eagle Sighting Elates Scientists

By Christopher Georges
Washington Post Staff Writer

A team of scientists ﬂying over the
Baltimore area in an observation aircraft
last month spotted an unusual sight: 3
pair of bald eagles nesting in a park out?
sidé that industrial city, the first Such-
sighting in half a century. ‘

The discovery by scientists from the
Maryland Department of Natural Re-
sources marked the first sign that the
endangered birds have returned to sub-
urban Baltimore County, where they
were last reported in 1936, and a further

' indication that bald eagles are making a,
comeback. , ‘ '

“It’s very encouraging not only for the
bald eagles but the endangered species
movement across the nation,” said Glenn
Therres, a Department of Natural Re-
sources biologist. “The eagle has been a
symbol for all endangered species, and it
shows that our efforts are paying off.”

The two bald eagles were sighted nest-
ing in a wooded area of Gunpowder Falls
State Park, a few miles northeast of Bal-
timore city. The eagles appear to be suc-
cessfully raising their young within three
miles of suburban homes and major road-
ways, scientists said.

“It is unlikely that the eagles will come
in any closer to Baltimore city because of
the lack of trees and feeding grounds,”
Said Jackson Abbott, coordinator of the
Audubon Naturalist Eagle Survey Pro-
ject. “It is rare for the [Baltimore] area,
but eagles are known to reoccupy old an-
cestral regions.”

The appearance of the eagles, scien-
tists said, is further evidence that despite

Bald eagles like this one photographed in 1982 have been sighted in Baltimore County.

According to Maryland officials, a sec-
tion of Gunpowder Falls State Park,
known as the Days Cove area, contains
ideal conditions for the eagles: shallow
water for feeding, an ample number of

trees and protection from human distur-

bances. Park officials said that the area
where the eagles have nested is tempo-
rarily restricted to the public.

The population of bald eagles declined
drastically during the 19503 and 1960s
because of urbanization and the use of pes-‘
tic'ides such as DDT. “DDT was banned in
1972, and since then the environment has
been ridding itself of the residue of the
pesticide in the ecosystem,” Therres said.

Pit Bulls: New Weapons in District
Dogs’ Popularity Rises in Run-Down Areas, Ofﬁcials Say

 

By Peter Pae
Washington Post Staff Writer

 

Five pit bull attacks in June—the highest
monthly number ever reported in the District——
have alarmed animal control and humane society
officers, who attribute the increase to the pop-
ularity of the extremely muscular, aggressive
breed as guard and fighting dogs.

Two of the attacks involved children, animal
control officers said. In one case, a 16-year-old
ordered his pit bull to attack an 11-year-old boy,
who had discovered the dog’s hiding place.

Pit bulls, originally bred in England for fight¢
ing other canines and bulls, can cause more bodi-
ly damage than other breeds, experts say. The
dog 1s known for not letting go once it bites with
its powerful jaws, which can exert more than
twice the pressure of a German shepherd or a
Doberman pinscher, a humane society officer
said.

Nationwide, in five of the fatal dog attacks
reported this year involved pit bulls, according to
the Humane Society of the United States. Since
mid-1983, pit bulls have been responsible for 20

of the 28 fatal dog bites. Fourteen of the 20 pit
bull victims were age 6 or younger.
In Northeast Los Angeles last week, an animal

control officer, who had gone to a duplex to in-.

vestigate a complaint of an attack by a pit bull,
had her arms and chest gnawed when the dog
rushed out the front door.

“Increasing numbers of pit bulls are being bred
and raised for fighting and guarding in the inner
cities of Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago and
the District of Columbia,” said Randall Lock-
wood, an animal behavior specialist for the U. S.
humane society. “And an equal proportion of
well- bred, well- -kept pit bulls are declining.”

Animal control experts and humane society
officers say pit bulls have become especially pop-
ular with teen-agers, some of whom are irre-
sponsible 1n training the dogs.

“Dogs are an extension of their power play,

particularly among people who think they are

powerless,” Lockwood said.

ficers, who say that as the breed gets more ag-

gressive, attacks on humans and
other animals could increase fur-
ther. , '

In Prince George’s County last
week, a pit bull was put to death
after the family dog severely
mauled a 5-yearoold boy in the groin
andlegs.

And in the District last month,
8syear-old Darnell Clark received
puncture wounds to a leg when a
13-year-old boy sicked his pit bull
on Darnell, who was on his way
home with his brother and a friend
from a supermarket.

 

Officials in Virginia, however,

said there have been no serious pit
bull attacks. '

“Some of the dogs that survive
fights are very aggressive and can-
not be rehabilitated,” said Tina
Harper, chief of animal disease con-
trol for the District. “One pit bull
ate through a chain-link fence to
maul an Afghan hound. We had to
put both dogs to sleep.”

The national humane society and
the Washington Humane Society,
the law enforcement agency for
animal cruelty cases here, are seek-
ing stronger legislation against dog
fighting in the District, where it is
currently a misdemeanor. Dog
fighting is a felony in 36 states, in-
cluding Maryland and Virginia.

Although ordinances aimed at
restricting pit bulls are popping up
across the country, many animal
experts consider such actions dis-
criminatory toward one breed and
fault the owners for the behavior of
some pit bulls.

“They have a bad name because
of the people who get them,” said
Bettijane Mackal, who rehabilitated
a pit bull that had been a fighter in
Hawaii. “He loves me dearly, but if
anyone bothered me, he would at
tack."

Although there are no statistics
on how many pit bulls are in the
District because most of them are
not registered, animal control ex-
perts and police say there may be
thousands.

“Just on observation, there seems
to be more and more pit bulls on the
streets, with most of the owners
being teen-agers," said Capt. Mike
Canfield, watch commander for the
6th District.

Humane society and animal con-

trol esperts said most of the pit .

bulls are in run-down areas of
Southeast and Northeast Washing-
ton, where the breed has become a
new cheap and loyal weapon.

“A pit bull is cheaper than a hand-
gun,” Lockwood said.

For that reason, many youths in
inner cities are getting pit bulls to
protect themselves and to be enter.

tained by the aggressive dogs when
they fight each other. “It’s a macho
thing to do,” said Donna Kessler, a
humane society officer who inves~
tigates dog fighting eases in the
District.

Last month, the 13-year-old, who
allegedly ordered his pit bull to at~
tack Darnell Clark, was arrested
and charged with assault with a
deadly weapon.

Darnell lives in the Eastgate
Dwelling housing project in South—
east, where pit bull fighting is ram-
pant, according to animal control
officials. Darnell said he is afraid of
dogs now because of the attack.

The dog had locked its jaws onto
Darnell’s leg, and Darnell's friends
had to hit the dog with a stick while
Darnell's brother pulled to get the
pit bull loose, Darnell said.

According to humane society of~
ficials, the 13-year~old had been

warned by the humane society a .

month earlier about using his pit
bull for fighting.

At Eastgate and in other pro-
jects, children as young as 8 years
old vie for a pit bull to fight other
pit bulls or to protect themselves
from others who might use the dog
as a weapon.

In most cases, parents are not
aware that their children own pit
bulls, which are hidden in aban-

doned buildings or in wooded areas,
humane society officers said.
Youths, however, admitted to
humane society officers and report-
ers that they want to obtain a pit

.bull and fight it and use it,as pro-

tection. A 10-year—old gave direc-
tions to a house with a litter, where
a pup could be purchased for $200.

Some youths openly boast about
the prowess and viciousness of their
pit bull. An 11-year-old Eastgate
youth said he had a pit bull that won
all of its fights but said he had to
give up his dog when his father dis-
covered it.

Several District veterinarians
said they have heard of dog fighting
but they have not treated many pit
bulls other than for wounds re-
ceived after inadvertent encounters
with other animals.

“These people don’t take the dog
to the vet," said veterinarian Rose-
mary Allsup. “They don’t want to
bring suspicion on themselves.”

At animal shelters, more pit bulls
are being brought in maimed,
scarred, and, in some cases, almost
dead after a dog fight, than ever
before, animal control officials said.

“We’re starting to realize now
how serious the problem is getting,”
said Kessler, who has been working
as a humane society officer for four
years. .

“It’s been a rapidly growing trend
in the last year,” said Jean Golden-
berg, Kessler’s coworker. “We’re
almost daily dealing with pit bull
fighting problems.”

  Owners
‘ Borne Public Fear _

l

By Marc Shridaldw

Pit bull dogs paid visits to

three county government of~

flees in the Bay Area yesterday,
but failed to convince officials
that their intimidating reputa~
tion is unfounded.

Reacting to the public's mount-
ing fear of the dogs, supervisors in

' Santa Clara, Alameda and Contra

Costa counties directed their staffs
to research new laws that would
control the canines.

The supervisorsnoted that con-
trol of pit bull dogs has been a hot
topic with their censtituents since
One of the animals killed a 2%-year-
old boy in Morgan Hill June 13.

. “I think in light or what we’ve
been seeing in the news ... pardon

the pun, the law should have more .

teethJ’ said Alameda County Super.
visor Bob Knox.

The supervisor's’ suggestions in
the wartime counties ranged from
”outright bans on the dogs to re.

, quirements that owners carry liabil-

ity insurance. post warning signs,
pay hefty registration fees and even
submit mug shots of their pets to

ganimal central officers.

Little heed was paid to pit bull
owners, several accompanied by
- their pets, who urged supervisors in
each county to let the public hyste
.ria subside before enacting new or-
.dinances.

- “The media make us seem like
some kind of low—life that crawled

from under a rock," said San Fran-

cisco pit bull owner and trainer Ju-
dith Breclta, who showed up at the

hearing in Alameda County. “It sells ‘

newspapers, it improves ratings for
TV, but what it does is send out a
hysteria. '

"Other breeds have a 'sudden
rage syndrome’ and yet that never
gets publicized.”

Brecka urged Alameda County

» supervisors not to single out pit

bulls if a new dog control ordinance
is eventually adOpted.

In Santa Clara and Centre Costa
ecuntles, pit bulls were taken to su~
pervisors’ meetings to show how
docile they can be.

However, an animal centrol of«
ﬂoor blocked the entry of one of the

terriers into the Santa Clara County
supervisors chambers in San Jose.

“I told (the ownerlno dogs al-
lowed,” said animal control officer
Jackie Fisher, who was on hand to
testify in favor of tougher pit bull
controls.

When passers-by gathered to
look at‘the dog, its owner, Gary
Wall, toolt the dog’s leash off. He
replaced it after Fisher warned him

that he could be fined 875 for haw '

ing an unleashed dog in a public
place.

Fisher added afterward, “0th- :

THE DENVER POST - July 14, 1987

_ This Fourth of July triggered off
a string of disasters in my home.
Firecrackers caused the death of
my little dog, Spooky, on the day
before the Fourth
When firecrackers began going
off in the afternoon, Spooky pan-
icked. She tried to get through our
6-foot wood gate. My two other
dogs sensed her panic and be-
haved in a “pac ” manner. I found
my Spooky dead in a pool of blood.
Her neck was chewed open, a
' sight I will never forget as long as
live.

Spooky had been a very dear

friend to me for six years. My two
, other dogs who killed her are not
.j killers. I have had them for six
years also. They went crazy with
the noise.

0n the night of the Fourth, I
could not be at home. I left my
two remaining dogs in the house,
‘ with windows closed to help blot
out the noise.

When I returned home, my back
door and a closed bedroom door
, had been clawed and chewed

through. These two dogs, who are
used to staying in the house, had
panicked.

I wish that people could realize ,

what these noises do to many ani-
mals. Innocent creatures do not
understand. Firecrackers can
cause total fear in an animal;
some go crazy.

The police department tells me
that all firecrackers are outlawed,
even sparklers.

Pet owners’ responsibility

I can understand the grief of the ‘

Broomfield police officer who re-
turned home from work to find his
dog dead, an apparent victim of
shock and anxiety from fireworks
on the Fourth of July (Letters, J u-
ly 9).

But I am deeply shocked and
troubled that Officer Peter Ellis
would threaten to turn his person-
a1 grief into a public vendetta.

Legal or not, fireworks are a
fact of life. A responsible pet own-
er, especially one who must be
away at such a time, must take
measures to protect the animal’s
safety.

Instead of locking his dog alone
and terrified in an empty house,
Officer Ellis , should have re-
quested tranquilizers from his vet

, to avert a possible tragedy.

I do sympathize with Officer E1-
lis’s tragedy. I’ve lost two beloved
pets to what I suspect were delib-

erate isonings -- while the dogs.

I trust that, as a professional, he

‘ will calm down enough to be ob-

Officer Ellis, I sincerely hope

' you will turn this sad event into a

day of joy for you and some home-

by adopting a new dog as soon as ,

possible.
' I hope you will learn the real
lesson of all this and not turn bitter

realize it at this moment, a pet’s
safety rests mostly with its master

cupation with fireworks” is a tra-
dition that dates back more than a
century. The only mindless idiots
in the fireworks controversy are
the officials who draft and try to
enforce un-American fireworks or-
dinances.

These ordinances are nothing
more than an attempt to rob
Americans of a holiday tradition.
Unless federal blackmail results in
the banning of fireworks sales",
many otherwise law-abiding citi-
zens will continue to enjoy the J u-
ly Fourth tradition of lighting fire-
works, despite threats by
vindictive police officers.

~. Coastal Panel dcks
Otter Relocation Pan

_ By Bill Sewer
Santa Monica

A controversial plan to establish a new colo-
ny for part of the state’s remaining 1,400 sea
otters cleared its first hurdle yesterday.

' The state Coastal Commission voted 7 to 5 to permit
the relocation of 250 otters from the central California
coast to San Nicolas Island, about 50 miles off Los
Angeles.

Almost exterminated by fur hunters at the turn of 5
the century, California sea otters now are found only
along a 225-mile strip of shoreline in Santa Cruz, Monte~
rey and San Luis Obispo counties.

The US. Fish and Wildlife Service hopes to divide
the threatened otters into two herds to ensure their
survival in case of a major oil spill. But the state fishing
industry opposes the relocation, saying the otters will
devour valuable shellfish.

“It’s a very difficult decision,” said commission
vice chairman Robert Franco.

A key part, of the plan that appeared to be the
decidingfactor/for the commission was a promise by
the Fish and Wildlife Service. to contain the otters to
San Nicolas Island.

. The relocation, which is scheduled to begin this
fall, also requires approval from the state Fish and
Game Commission. That panel will vote on the plan

next month.

The coastal commission members who favored the
plan are chairman Michael Wornum, Gilbert Contreras,

. Duane Garrett, Mary Lou Howard, David Malcolm, Su-
L sun McCabe and Robert Franco. Those who opposed the
» plan are Steve MacElvaine, Donald Mclnnis, Thomas
? VicMurray, Mark Nathanson and Dorill Wright.

Pet Lovers’ Budgets GoTo The Dogs * ~

@1987, Words by Wire

, F ONLY Lassie had lived to see it. Poor Lassie,
running naked and unadorned through fields of

. clover, earning her keep by herding livestock,
: pulling that little klutz Timmy out of the river, and
dragging ol’ Cramps from under the overturned
. tractor. And what was Lassie’s reward for being the
. noblest collie of them all? A bowl of fatty table

scraps, a pat on the snout and a bed next to the wood-
burning stove in the kitchen.

Today, if Lassie had the right owner, she’d be
. swaddled in mink, draped with diamonds, feasting on
nutritionally balanced biscuits, spritzed with
. perfume and ensconced in a custom-built, $11,000
; Swiss-chalet doghouse. And she wouldn't have to do a
thing to earn her keep except wag her tail once in a
‘ while.
America has entered the pamper-’em—to—death
' stage of culture. Witness how infants with no concept
of bladder control are outfitted in the latest designer
fashions. Dogs, which know how to make even the
. most loatbesome human feel loved and important -
Hitler was so devoted to his Alsatian bitch that he
had her put to sleep before he committed suicide -
are treated even better.

Some concerned social scientists claim that such
excess is a sure sign of the Decline of Western
Civilization As We Know It, but perhaps they do not

realize how important dogs are to people in our

alienated, high-tech, high-stress world.

“Studies have shown that just being in the same

room with a dog causes a reduction in the heart rate
and blood pressure,” said Linda Hines, spokeswoman,
for the Delta Society, an international non-profit
organization in Renton, Wash, that coordinates
research‘on human/animal interaction.

Dogs always have been important in human

culture, but the difference today is that dogs, like
humans, have moved from the blue-collar world into
the service industry. No longer are dogs used

,primarily to herd sheep, retrieve dead ducks and
rescue lost mountaineers. Today, dogs are
companions and baby sitters, loving friends who
greet us at the end of a day at the office with joy in

' their eyes and their tongues hanging out. Consider

them Valium with fur.

Alan Beck is the primary researcher on the role of

pets in the lives of humans, doing basic behavior and
epidemiological studies at the University of
. Pennsylvania’s School of Veterinary Medicine.

“Humans have been keeping dogs for at least ‘

- 15,000 years,” Beck said, and any behavior that has
been going on that long has to have some significant
' relationship to human health.

“Our studies show that animals in the home are

treated sociologically as an additional family
member, not as a substitute but as a welcome and

.-.. “.1. . 3

,

often favored family member. Forty percent of dog

owners keep a picture of the animal in their wallet or
on display; 30 percent celebrate the animal’s ‘
birthday. What’s very significant is that 40 percent of
all owners — 70 percent of adolescents -- confide in
their dog. This means that kids going through some
of their most difficult yeaisare able to really talk
about their feelings with their pet, feelings that they

7 might not be able to share with anyone else.”

No wonder we spend billions of dollars on dogs.
Anything that earns its keep bylmaking us feel loved
and happy, anything that understands us, is always
paid more than something that merely fetches the
paper or bites strangers.

Joint Advisory Council, a trade association based in

}:.'i‘t'!l‘il"‘l’; filiiltl Dr()dUC€S a line Of

mat a»; for dogs called “Dogwear.”

Tc rry Brigid, president of the Pet
Industry Distributors Association,
wnoiesales 8,00u pet products from
his Vista, Calif, company, Lee-Mar
Pet Supplies, and increasingly those
products include highsend specialty

_ items. ‘ _

“We’re seeing things like dog
sweaters and raincoats, dog toenail

'- polish and dog waterbeds,” Boyd

said. “Where retailers used to carry

' a basic leather leash, today custom-
' ers want'fine nylon leashes, and in a

spectrum of colors so they can col-
or-coordinate. If your dog has a red
sweater, you wouldn’t want to take
him out in public with a green leash.
Pets are being treated more like

people, and since people today are .l
more canton—conscious about them- ‘
selves, they’re also fashion-con-

scious about their dogs.”

if the fashion sense of the pet
world has been raised, the property
value of their homes has
skyrocketed.

While the press brayed about the
exorbitance of Jimr'and Tammy
Bakker’s air-conditioned doghouse,
it would be considered just a run-
down sliack at Animal Manors, a
New York City company that spe-
cializes in elaborate, handmade
doghouses that are more art pieces

than doggie condos,

Animal Manors’ ‘houses are de-

~ signed by real architects, custom-

made for individual dogs. There’s a
French chateau for poodles, a Swiss
chalet with hardwood floors for rus-

tic dogs and an English manor for
Sheepdogs. Some are tiled, some.

carpeted and all have windows. A
psychologist who specializes in ani-

' mal communications advises the

firm on the emotional and environ-
mental needs of the animal, helping
to choose the appropriate scale, col-
or and materials.

”$hy tings want more enclo—
sure and relaxed dogs want more
openness of dcsngn,” said Cannon
Gather, president of Animal Man-

ors. “We have a Persian temple de-
sign that. is very airy, for example,

. and this would not be right for a dog

who wants to retreat. It would be a
better house for a dog that likes

attention.”

. While the "personalityof the pet
may vary, the financial status of the
owners should be gold-card solvent:
Animal Manors’ simplest designs

sell for $195, while the top-o‘f—the-'

line French chateau (built by the
senior restorer of musical instru-
ments at the Metropolitan Museum

' Of Art.) is $11,000.

“Giving a dog a house that is love-

ly is a way of thanking the pet for-

physically and emotionally helping
the‘owner,” Garber said. “I see the

creation of special things for ani- ,

mals as a way of recognizing what
they do for us.”

This need to recognize the canine
contribution to human well-being
finds expression in that most classic
reward: the dog biscuit. Here, too,
the product has been refined and
upscaled, stripped of salt, sugar and

,additives and turned into a health

(albeit expensive) treat.

Linda Coffee has created what _

just might be the best dog biscuit in
the country, using only stone-ground
whole wheat, fresh garlic and roma-
no cheese. The biscuits are sold
through her shop, Haute Canine, in

Minneapolis, and through the Nord-
_ strom department stores and spe-

cialty shops nationally. A 1.0-ounce
bag sells for $6 ——- about four.times
the cost of .. industry leader Milk-
Bone dog biscuits and, at $9 a pound,
more per pound than filet mignon.

The Haute Canine biscuits are - .
packaged to appeal to your basic.

BMW-Godiva chocolate-Esprit con-
sumers. They come stacked neatly
in an elegant brown-and-beige, foil-
lined bag that looks as if it holds
gourmet coffee beans, the kind of
bag that product designers call a
“pouch.” The wrapper has the let-
ters “H” and “C” (for Haute Canine)
repeated in an interlocking pattern,
giving the bag the same look you

find on products by Christian Dior
or Gucci.

“Our package does sell the owner
initially,” Coffee agreed, “but it’s
the animals’ response to the product
that gives us our repeat business.
Dogs love the flavor of cheese and
garlic.”

To really make the dog—biscuit ex-

perience complete, Fido should ‘

wash it down with a cold bottle of
Oh Boy! ——~ a beef-flavored vitamin
and mineral enriched “doggie
drink.” An ll-ounce, (SQ-cent bottle
of Oh Boy! ——- with its foil top and
green glass container - looks just
like a bottle of imported beer. It’s

the kind of drink hard-working Do- '

bermans and German shepherds
would belt down after a day of
guarding a nuclear power plant.

, And for those owners who may want

to share the good times with their

pets, have no fear: The label of Oh

Boy! declares it safe; for human
consumption.

Finally, we come to a, pet product
that might surprise people —— Mar-
tine and Christophe, introduced in

, November 1986, “the' first designer

fragrances for the dog who has ev-
erything.” Dog perfume. A 3.3-
ounce French Crystal decanter of
Martine (for females) sells for
$38.50, while Christophe cologne
sells for $30. Now, many would
question why dogs —- who love to
roll in garbage and typically greet
each other by exchanging rear-
sniffs —- would be interested in per-

fume made from sandalwood and-

jasmine. The answer is, of course,
that dogs couldn’t care less. But
owners care a great deal.

“I definitely feel that these are
important products, not cutesy little
things,” said Lisa Gilford, who con-
ceived Martine and Christophe for
her Le Chien celebrity pet salon in

New York City. “The fragrance is

designed to please the owner; the
dog doesn’t know if it smells good.
But even if the animal doesn’t know
that it smells good, it knows that it’s
clean and taken care of.

 

 

“It’s really a lovely fragrz‘ince. I
have several clients who [use it
themselves. One elderly society lady
friend of mine twilight some for her
poodle and told me, ‘Lisa. I just love
it for myself, forget Bergdorf

Goodman.’

While the excesses of one dog lov-
er are. just the basic necessities of
another, the consideration and at-
tention given to dogs speaks to the
value and comfbrt humans find in
theirpets. ,

“One good thing that I hope will
come out of our research at the uni-M
versity,” Beck said, “is that people

“ will no longer have to feel ashamed

 

to care about an animal. Someone
who spends $1,000 on a set of,golf
clubs is considered a serious sports-
man, but spending $1,000 on a life-

- saving operation for your dog is con-‘

sidered wasteful. Lavishing care on
a pet is no more crazy than paying a
scalper $500 for a ticket to a rock
concert.“

X from our readers

Even a pit bull can be mania best friend

am usually in agreement
with the opinion of the Free

: Press on many issues, but I will.

, have to admit that it would be
most difficult to back the opinion
of your June 20 editorial “Pit
g Bulls: Better regulation of this
potentially dangerous . dog is
needed.” It appears that you may
have not thoroughly studied the
: whole issue. With all'the laws
that are presently on the books
_ and not enforced, the passage of
’ still another law that will also not
be properly enforced will only
crowd the books more.
Consequently, if a new law
against pit bulls was by chance
enforced, weakly at best, you
would only be punishing legiti-
. mate dog lovers who appreciate a
very loving breed, namely the
bull terrier. The illegal pit bull
_ owners, operators and those who
. attend the illegal and cruel pit
bull rings will go unscathed as

they always have. Another use- '

less law is only another joke to
them. ’

Approving discrimination
against one breed is unaccept-
able. Why not update and enforce
the laws already on the books?
Why not make the owners of all
breeds of vicious dogs account-
able? A special licensing of bull
' terrier breeders might be in or-
der. A complete check on those
purchasing the pups might,
though only slightly, help in the
control.

Who is to determine what is a
pit bull or a pit bull mix? If most
veterinarians have difficulty de-
tecting a bull mix, can you?

A'GGIE MONFETTE

A problem of people

I AM saddened by your sup-
port of‘the unenforceable and

unconstitutional piece of legisla-
tion concerning the pit bull. It is

I patently not true that the “. . . pit

bull terrier is by nature a surly
and potentially dangerous animal
. . .” In eight years of small ani-
mal veterinary practice, I have
met only one pit bull that was not
exceedingly outgoing, friendly,
trusting and trustworthy.

It is not a problem with the
breed; it is a multi-faceted people
problem. First, if there were not

financial gain in betting on dog,

fights, those responsible for

 

 

 

fighting them would be less in-

clined to do so. Second, the total

lack of respect for these creatures
as living, feeling beings allows
people to abuse them. Third, it is
with willful intent that humans
selectively breed the most ag-
gressive members of this other-

, wise lovable breed, then train
them using live kittens and rab-‘

bits and by other cruel methods to
encourage this aggressiveness.
These unthinking, uncaring and
irresponsible people are the true
cause of the, brutal and tragic pit
bull attacks. - '

felonies, do you really think that
they would honor a law such as
this? _

Write a law for all breeds

I READ the June 24 article by
Teresa Blossom on the pit bull
attack in California (“Council
holds public hearing on ways to
control pit bulls”). I must inform
you of a mistake in her article. I
saw the attack on television and
the pit bull did not break through
the screen of the door as stated in
the article. The owner said that
she was letting the dog out of the
house, and the animal control
person and others had better pre-
pare themselves. She then opened
the door and the dog attacked the
animal control person twice.

I had to inform you of the
oversight because it misleads
people. All animals are capable of
being vicious; granted, some ani-
mals are naturally more vicious
than others. That is the point I
wanted to make. BeCause of the
variability in an animal’s disposi-
tion, there should be an ordinance
mandating that all pet owners be
held responsible for the actions of
the “loyal” companions.

I am just glad people are final-
ly realizing the danger of “tame"
animals and that something is
being done. Unfortunately, most
of the people are becoming nar-
row-minded because of the pub-
licity given to the attacks of only-
pit bulls.

The state that gave us Butch Cassidy“
and the Sundance Kid has produced 1111-.
Other hero who has ended up on the

wrong side of the law. -

To the Wild West history of Wyoming
‘add the name of :222 “222’ lover Maxine
,Haste, a 71- year-o“ 2.5.;111mother who
lives near remote Meeteetse.

Today at high noon, a cell doOr in the;

Powell County Jail in Cody will clang
open and Mrs. Haste will walk out afree
woman after 48 hours behind bars on a
charge of contempt of court~

The saga began harmlessly enough

last August when a Gordon setter mix'

was found lying in a roadway by Mrs-
Haste and her daughter, Nova Kim.

- .. mug.

Kim said that when they found the

~ deg, since named “Missy,” they took her

to a vet and then home.
Mrs. Haste has a penchant of rescuing
stray 0r injured animals and taking them

' to'her northwestern Wyoming ranch,"

which is home to 10 dogs, ineluding

-. Missy, 48 cats and a chicken, said Kim.
. j-She said they advertised on a local ra-

rdio station that they had found the dog,
but no one answered the ad for five
months.

And when Julie Thompson of Park
County did show up to claim Missy, Kim
said, the dog didn’t respond to Thomp-
son, so Mrs. Haste refused to give her
the dog.

_ Thompson, meanwhile, took the mat-

in hoosegow

ter to officials, claiming she went to Mrs.

_ Haste s ranch home in August to claim
. the dog.

And Mrs. Haste ultimately was

ries a maximum fine of $750 and six

Wednesday when Alternate Justice of the

Peace James Allison jailed Mrs Haste

But Mrs. Haste already has done some

: hard time, said Kim.

1 “She said they offered her food but she

_ Kim also said jailers wouldn’t even let
her speak with her mother when Kim de-

Some cities and towns have banned pit bulls,
but dog experts say such laws are too .vague.‘ .

By FRED BAYLES
Associated Press .

ichael Barry has spent a year researching

canine blood lines. Not a dog breeder but

a city attorney, Barry is seeking a way to
keep pit bullterriers out of Lynn, Mass. ~- ’

“The question has taken up our time, but we re

glad we’ve done it,” said Barry, who has already

faced one court test of a city ordinance that puts

special constraints on pit—bull owners. "The

number of incidents with pit bulls has gone down
dramatically.” ,

Spurred by attacks on humans by such dogs,

'~ cities and towns across the country are looking for

the Staffordshire bullterrier, the

American Staffordshire terrier, the
”American pit bullterrier and, some-

times, the bullterrier, known as
companion to both Gen. George
Patton Jr. and villain Bill Sikes in
the movie musical 011'ver, and more
recently as Spuds MacKenzie, the
"party dog” in beer commercials.

The animals weigh 40 to 60
pounds and have powerful chest,
neck and jaw muscles.

Devoted owners say the dogs are

’smart and affectionate. They point Q
to such American icons as Buster,

Brown’s dog, Tige; Pete, the dogin.
the Our Gang comedies; and the
RCA Victor dog as examples of the

'breeds’ finer qualities. * .
But the, breeds have a sinister

reputation. Bred over centuries for
dog fighting, a vicious, now illegal
blood sport, pit bulls are tenacious,
aggressive animals. '

They are considered dangerous
because of their tendency to lock
onto a victim with their powerful”
jaws. Donald Clifford, a veterinar-
ian and director of laboratory-ani—
mal medicine at the Medical Col-
lege of Ohio in Toledo, said his
study of the animals makes him
believe their "gameness” sets them
apart from other breeds. _

"Other dogs will eventually quit
an attack, whereas pit bulls con-
tinue to fight,” he said. “You‘read
how once they lock onto a little kid,
it’s goodbye little kid. They don’t
injure you a little bit. They con-
tinue to drill in.”

Moreover, problems associated

with pit bulls are exacerbated by

some of their owners, according to

; Michael Ushijima, general counsel
I forthe 200,000member American

Dog Owners Association. Many

Calif, boy fatally savaged by a
neighbor’s dog. The child was killed
when he wandered into a yard
where the dog was leashed. Author-
ities said the dog was guarding his

 

l

 

, master’s marijuana patch.

The laws passed in response to
such attacks have met with varying
levels of acceptance.

In Lynn, where Barry said four
or five attacks had been recorded in

the past two years, an attack on a

mailman prompted a temporary
mail boycott of the street where the
dog lived. City officials then refused
to register any more pit bulls. . ,

“The intent was that if any new.“
pit bulls were brought in, they
would be banned from the city,”
Barry said.

But a court challenge by several
groups, including the dog—owners
association, succeeded in removing
the ban. Pit-bull owners now must
keep their dogs in secured areas
and take them off the property only
to visit a vet. That section of the
ordinance is also under appeal.

Dog owners also have challenged
a law in Cincinnati that bans pit
bulls within the city limits. Assis-
tant City Solicitor Bob Johnstone
said the law is working.

"Four or five dogs were turned

over to the city and destroyed,” he '

said. “We haven’t had an incident
in quite awhile.”

In Chester, Pa., a year-old law
that requires owners to carry hefty
liability policies and pay $500 ,

Alligata victim most likely a
:had no warning before attack

;By MICHAEL McCLELLAND
of United Press International

TALLAHASSEE — A college stu-
dent attacked by an 11-foot alligator
while swimming in a state park died
“within seconds” and probably nev-
er knew what hit him, state wildlife
officials said Tuesday.

The alligator seized the swim-
mer for food, they said.

Florida State University student
George P. Cummings, 29, was snor-
keling in an out-of-bounds area of
Wakulla Springs State Park when
the attack occurred.

Authorities said sightseers in a
glass-bottomed tour boat saw Cum-
mings swim past the craft just be-
fore the attack. Witnesses later said
they saw part of a man’s body hang-
ing from the mouth of the alligator.

Wildlife officials said Cummings

area, ignoring signs warning swim-
mers to stay inside the ropes, down-
stream and into the alligator’s hunt-
ing area.

“Apparently, Mr. Cummings un-
knowingly swam down the main run
'of the spring, right into the habitat
where the gator lived every day,”
said Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission spokesman Stan
Kirkland. “The alligator attacked
him, and killed him by drowning
him.” ,' g
“It was a horrible experience,”
said Sightseer Grace Crouch, who
was sitting near the bow of the tour
boat.

The tour guide, unaware of what
the alligator was doing, pointed him
out and said, “Looks like he just
caught his lunch.” ‘

Crouch said it “looked like a
young deer” before the alligator lift-
ed its head to reveal Cummings’

IT IS interesting that less than two percent
of monies used at state levels for wildlife
management is spent on non-game speCies.
The balance is used to ensure that adequate
quantities of game animals are available to
the trapper. Apparently trappers believe that
non-game animals have the technology to
control their own population levels, but game
animals do not. The fact remains that under
present wildlife management, game animals
are manipulated to produce a constant sur-
plus ready to be “harvested.”

Coming Back from the Brink

 

Alligators and leopards are no longer seen as endangered

T 0 animal preservationists, leopard

’ coats and alligator shoes have long
ranked among the most ﬂagrant symbols
of human indifference to the fate of wild
animals. Even among the general public,
consciousness has been raised high
enough so that anyone sporting ﬁnery
made from the skins of endangered ani-
mals runs the risk of at .
least verbal assault.

The attackers may

have to shift emotional
gears, however. Last
month the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service formally
announced that the Amer-
ican alligator is no longer
an endangered species.
And, at a meeting this
week in Ottawa, the U.N.’s
Convention on Interna-
tional Trade in Endan-
gered Species will release a
report urging not only that
the common leopard be re-
moved from its list of en-
dangered animals but that
legal hunting be resumed.

While the alligator’s
recovery has been “phe-
nomenal,” according to
David Klinger of the FWS, it seems that
the spotted feline may never have faced a
catastrophe in the ﬁrst place. Unlike its
truly rare cousin the Himalayan snow
leopard, thecommon leopard made the
list, in the 19703, largely for emotional
reasons. Worries about shrinking habitats
and excessive hunting were “clearly over-
blown,” admits Jaques Ber- l! “
ney, deputy secretary-general
of CITES. “Leopards are not
like Cheetahs,” he observes.
“They’re highly adaptable
animals.”

The push to recategorize
the leopard is based on a ﬁve-
month study, conducted in 23
countries by Rowan Martin,
chief ecologist for Zimba-
bwe’s department of national
parks and wildlife manage-
ment, and Belgian Biologist
Tom de Meulenaer. The pair
used eyewitness accounts and
statistical computer modeling
to estimate Africa’s leopard
population at a healthy
700,000 to 850,000. The 75- to
150-lb. cats have even been
, sighted recently on the out—

? skirts of Nairobi. The biolo-
‘ gists went so far as to recom-
, mend theresumption of g
l international trade in leopard

 

 

 

 

skins. The best approach to leopard man-
agement, they argue, is to legalize a limited
“harvest,” diverting revenues from poach-
ers and providing an estimated $29 mil—
lion to “governments and law-abiding
citizens.” .

The reclassiﬁcation of the alligator,
however, is a true victory. Twenty years

ago, the toothy reptiles had been so assidu-
ously hunted, says FWS Director Frank
Dunkle, “that many believed the species
would never recover.” Skin-seeking
poachers had killed the animals by the
tens of thousands. In 1966 Congress
passed the ﬁrst of the Endangered Species
Acts, which banned hunting any animal at

 

 

risk of elimination over a major part of its
range. Such legislation was spectacularly
successful for the gators, thanks in large
part to the FWS agents who enforced it.

One of the heroes was David Hall, an
agent who went undercover for nearly ten
years in the swamps and bayous of the
South. Hall would get to know the locals
and start buying alligator hides from trad-
ers; at one point, he operated a tanning
factory for more than a year. “The big
traders would bring their skins to me in
l8—wheel trucks,” says Hall, “and we’d
bust them on the spot. I know the real

0 Crocodile Dundees, and
”A" I’ve arrested about half of
them.”

Alligator populations
rebounded rapidly. Says
Klinger: “All we had to do
was stop the poachers, and
the gators did the rest.” In
Alabama, for example, bi-
ologists reported a tenfold
increase in alligators be-
tween the n1id—l9705 and
the early ’805. By 1985 the
FWS declared the animal
no longer endangered in
Louisiana, Florida and
Texas, where 90% of the
animals live, and last
month it extended that de-
cision to the seven other
states where gators are
found. “We’ve got more al-
ligators than we know
what to do with,” exclaims Klinger,
who says there may now be several
million.

The alligator is not the only FWS suc-
cess: the brown pelican, once in danger, is
now oﬁ" the list in several states. The bald
eagle is up from its 1963 low of 417 active
nests in the lower 48 states to some 2,000
breeding pairs this year—not
enough to be declassiﬁed but
an impressive return for the '
national symbol. Unfortu-
nately not all protected spe-
cies can be coaxed into bounc-
ing back. Despite government
protection, ther_e are no
known California condors left
in the wild; the remaining 27
are in captivity. And in 70
years of trying to save the
whooping crane, the popula-
tion has grown from a low of
15, in 1941, to just 170 birds.
Nor can deletions from the
endangered list begin to keep
pace with the new additions.
At the moment, 449 anirnal
and plant species remain list-
ed in the US; 37 of them were
added in 1987 alone.

Atlanta area skunk owners

Fulton County ordinance that

~ bans the sale, purchase or posses-

Claiming that their skunks are
maligned and not malodorous,
members ’of an organization
called Skunks As Pets (SAP) plan
to meet with Fulton County com-

to kill an albino skunk placed at

 

 

the animal shelter after its owner

‘ ' left it with a friend and never re-

claimed it. The skunk is scheduled
to be “given a painless death”
Monday, said Bill Garrett, Atlanta '

Jailed man attached
to one dog too many

Associated Press

HOLLAND —— Joel Zophy is
spending 90 days in jail because he
kept one too many dogs in his house
-— three in a city that allows only two
dogs per owner.

“I think it’s foolish,” said Zophy-’3
father, Walter Zophy. “He’s sort of
trying to become a martyr or some-
thing. He does love the dogs. He has
a very affectionate, emotional at-
tachment to them.” "

The younger Zophy’s dispute with
the law began Feb. 10, when police
charged him with keeping too many
dogs.

The 38-year-old Zophy, who lives
in his parents’ house with his dogs
Whidney, Minnie and Runny, was
charged Feb. 20 with the same viola--
tion. -
On June 11, he was found guilty
on both counts by Holland Districct

 

Judge Kenneth Post. Zophy was sen-
tenced to two years’ probation on the
first offense and ordered him to keep
no more than two dogs.

On the second offense, he ordered
Zophyto serve at least 90 days in jail,
plus any more time needed to ﬁnd
another home for one of his three
dogs.

Zophy packed Runny off to a
kennel and himself off to jail, his
father said.

According to Zophy’s father, Wid-
ney, a mixed terrier, is 13 years old,
has cancer and is going blind because
of diabetes. The other two dogs, each
2 years old, are Widney’s offspring.

“I’m trying to show people that
they have to stand up for their
rights,” said Joel Zophy. “They can’t
let them be eroded by government.
The city wants to urbanize all of

‘ Holland.”

Woman accused of biting arm of law

LANSING ~—- A warrant has been

Tuesday after animal control ofﬁcer
Vicki Warren found an unlicensed
dog roaming a neighborhood Mon-
day, Ingham County Assistant Pros-

The prosecutor said Warren, 25,
went to the rear door of the house
where the dog was found and knock-
ed on the door. When no one an-
swered, Patzer said, Warren put a
leash on the dog and started leading
it to her truck. -

The owner of the dog, who was
not identiﬁed pending arraignment,
then came out of the house and
attacked Warren and bit her, accord-
ing to county Prosecutor Don Mar-
tin.

Authorities said Warren was bit-

will not, well, be alone and lonely.
The answer is yes, I am lonely

Mounted police
worry about fate of
retlred horses.

By BETH WHITEHOUSE '
Staff Writer

POMPANO BEACH — When mounted
Police Officer Beezie Northrop writes out
parking tickets, his horse, Big Gray, likes
to help —- sort of.

The gray horse will nudge Northrop’s
hand with his head while he writes, trying
to knock the pen from his hand.

“He plays, just like a little kid does,”
said Northrop, who obviously has become
quite attached to his four-legged law en-
forcement partner.

That’s why he and the other Pompano
police officers are proposing new city poli-
cy that would prevent their horses from re-
tiring to the slaughterhouse.

“Currently, they’re considered city pr0p-
erty,” said Sgt. Bill Elfo of the mounted pa-
trol unit. “Live horses are treated as any
other surplus city property and are ulti-
mately sold to the public.”

Although the four-year-old unit has yet
to retire a .sickly or elderly horse, Elfo
said, auctioning off horses means they’d
probably end up being bought, killed and
used to make “pet food or glue.”

The pr0posed policy would allow the
chief of police to donate the animal to an
organization such as the Florida Sheriffs
Youth Ranches in North Florida, where the
animals could happily live out their lives,
Elfo said.

Pompano Beach now has three
horses - Whiskers, 16, Jody, 7, and
Big Gray, 9. All the department’s
horses are donated, Elfo said.

The horses are used to.patrol the .

beaches on weekends and are use-
ful in the Pompano Fashion Square
parking lot where the elevated offi-
cers can see people breaking into
cars, Elfo said.

They also participate in “crack
runs” in which the horse can chase

are just good public relations for'

the department, said mounted Po-

The city spends $13,000 a year to

In Bro-ward County, Fort

has nine horses, Davie has two.

choice is to donate the horse to an-

zation, he said.

In Davie, the mounted patrol di-
vision is four years old and hasn’t

yet had to retire a horse, said Sgt. :

Carl Fitzgerald.

He said the department probably
would offer to give the horse back
to the donor or find a good home for
it. . »

“We wouldn’t in any way let one
of our animals be destroyed,”
O’Neil said. “You grow to love
them.”

“It’s just like a guy with a dog,”
said Northrop. “They’re our
friends, our buddies. It would make
me really feel bad if anything ever
happened to Big Gray.”

FOR MANY PEOPLE, HAPPINESS
IS A WARM PUPPY. PET STORES
WORK HARD TO PROMOTE THIS
IDEA, CREATING THE IMPRES-
SION THAT WHAT THEY ARE
SELLING IS COMPANIONSHIP, AF-
FECT ION AND LOVE. THIS CAN
BE PERFECTLY TRUE. BUT BE-
HIND THE REASSURING IMAGES,
THE WAGGING TAILS AND SKILL~
FUL MARKETING, THERE IS AN
UGLY SIDE TO THE HIGHLY PROF-
ITABLE RETAIL PUPPY TRADE.

The vast majority of the 350,000
to 500,000 purebred puppies that will
be sold this year in pet shops—at
prices ranging from $300 to well over
$1000—will have been produced by
Midwestern commercial breeders in
facilities widely known as “puppy
mills.”

A PARADE investigation of the

puppy mill-pet shop trade revealed
the following:
0 Breed dogs suffer a variety of abuses
in many of the puppy mills. One of
' the most common is lack of adequate
shelter to protect them from the ﬁerce
heat, heavy rains and bitter cold com-
mon in the Midwest. Many spend
their lives crammed into old chicken
cbops, makeshift kennels or small
wire cages that sometimes are stacked
atop each other. Conditions sometimes
are ﬁlthy, the dogs are infested with
parasites, and many suffer from ill-
nesses or medical conditions that go
untreated. .

Puppies usually are raised as a cash
crop in rural areas, often as a sec-
ond income for their breeders. Be-
cause proﬁt margins are slim, veter-
inary care is the exception.

0 Puppies bound for the pet—shop
trade are bred with little concern for
passing on genetic defects, person-
ality disorders or other undesirable
traits. The goal is quantity, not qual-
ity. This does not mean that you can‘t
buy from the store a healthy pup that
will make an excellent family pet,
but it is a gamble. Veterinarians ad-
vise visiting a breeder, examining the
pup’s parents for health, looks and
temperament and checking the con-
ditions in which the litter was raised.

The national breed clubs, in fact,
either forbid or discourage their mem-
bers from selling pups to pet shops.
The result: Pet-shop dogs—usually
more expensive than those purchased
from a local breeder—stand a greater
chance of being diseased or of de-
ve10ping crippling congenital defects,
such as hip dysplasia.

O The American Kennel Club is the

 

 




 

nation’s largest registry for purebred
dogs and derives millions of’ dollars
,‘ each year from registering the litters
* bred by puppy-mill owners and then
recording the pedigrees of the indi-
vidual dogs after they are purchased.
Part of this money goes to underwrite
AKC dog shows and trials, which tend
to be the province of well-heeled dog
fanciers.

The AKC describes itself as an
organization devoted to regulating
breeders, improving the purity ' '
and advancing the welfare j of
thoroughbred dogs, yet it does
virtually nothing to help elimi-
nate the physical abuses and
poor breeding practices charac-
teristic of the puppy mills. “Be-
cause a dog is kept in appalling ‘
conditions, is it any less regis-
terable?” asks Roy H. Carlberg,
the club’s executive secretary.
And, he notes, it is not the
AKC’s job to police puppy mills.

There is a widespread pub-
lic assumption that AKC regis- ‘
tration assures a healthy, quality
animal. Without AKC papers, ,
pet shops are forced to sell pups
for considerably less money. 7‘
However, AKC papers only ver-
ify that a pup is the known off-
spring of registered purebred par-
ents and was born on a certain "
date. WilliamF. Stifel, the club’s : g ,
president, was asked what he
would do if someone applied
for AKC papers for a blind , deaf,

 

Society investigator: “The AKC is re-
luctant to go after the puppy mills
because it derives millions of dollars
from registering these dogs. Fees from
these deplorable mass-production mills
are underwriting the AKC’s presti-
gious events like the Westminster Ken-
nel Club show. ”

of a few cosmetic changes, he feels
there has been little imprOVement.

“The places look a little better, a‘
little cleaner, but the basic handling
and care is the same,” he reports.
“The USDA is still not aggressively
enforcing the law. In some places,
their deﬁciencies border on criminal
misconduct.”

tions in the Midwest,

chain of East Coast pet stores, I was
able to inspect the puppy mills and
talk with their owners.
Conditions—to my untrained eye—
ranged from adequate to abominable
in the dozen randomly chosen facilities.
Three or four were Spartan and
makeshift but clean, with dogs kept in
outdoor runs or cages combined with
small heated indoor quarters that offered
protection from the weather extremes.
Food and fresh water were available
and, chatting with the owners, I
could easily detect that they cared
for their dogs and tried diligently

g to provide for them.

.. 3 At the otherextreme were three

' with conditions disturbing
enough for me to request the
USDA’s chief veterinarian in

~Kansas to order an immediate
inspection. The worst of them
was a ﬁlthy, trash-strewn com-
pound with 30 or more beagles
and other hounds. There were
ﬁlthy, skinny dogs tied by short
chains to trees or old wooden
kennels, with others living in
open fenced compounds. The
only shelter was an old truckbed
camper tap.

That morning, it was a bone-
chilling 6 degrees, and the shiv-
ering animals had neither food
nor water. At some of the other
puppy mills, I had found frozen
water bowls , but these dogs didn’t’
even have ice. Checking later, I
learned that the USDA had sent
three ofﬁcials to check out the

 

three-legged purebred pup with
hip dysplasia and green fur.

“We would register the dog,” Stifel

said. “AKC unfortunately does not
mean quality.”
0 Federal law sets minimum standards
for housing and care of dogs in whole-
sale commercial kennels, but the US.
Department of Agriculture enforces
the Animal Welfare Act unevenly. The
USDA does net regard inspecting an-
imal facilities as one of its higher pri-
orities. For two years, the agency has
unsuccessfully petitioned Congress not
to ﬁnance the program, so it could
drop the reSponsibility in the hope
thatthe states would take it on.

The Humane Society of the United
States has taken the lead among na-
tional animal-welfare organizations in
exposing the abuses in the puppy
mill-pet shop trade and in trying to
push the American Kennel Club into

after completing a USDA training
course, he posed as a businessman

His conclusions: 80 percent had se-
rious deﬁciencies and only one met
all of the requirements of the Animal
Welfare Act. .As a result, the USDA
started cracking downon the mills.
Baker has continued to monitor the

facilities and exhibitors in the state.

agreed to make improvements, another
elected to relinquish his federal license
and get out of large-scale commercial
breeding. But at this worst place, the
government inspectors could not legal-
ly go on the property and examine
the conditions because the owner had
allowed his federal license to lapse in
1985 and—30 dogs to the contrary~
was not ofﬁcially still in the commer-
cial dog business.

If the federal government w0n’t take
the lead in ending puppy-mill abuses,
whose responsibility is it? Pet shops
benefit most from the mass—breeding ‘
industry but reject the notion that abuses
are widespread or that animals pro-
duced in these conditions are inferior
to animals bred by local dog fanciers.

ATLANTA JOURNAL _- July 20, 1987

Coyotes’ taste fermions“

' seen or heard the small

 

can be problem forfarmer

By Charles Salter
Staff Writer

 

The problem with coyotes in Geor-
gia is that they’re such particular gro-
cery shoppers. '

“They will eat watermelons, canta-

loupes and tomatoes,” wildlife biologist
Bill Cooper of Tifton said. “They will
devastate a watermelon field.
4 ' “Coyotes will go down the field and
bite each melon until they get to one
they want,” he continued. “Then they
will tear it Open and eat it. So each one
they bite is lost from a commercial
standpoint.”

Since the coyote is common on
Western prairies, most Georgians prob-
ably never have seen or heard the yip,
yelp or bowl of the small wolf, except
- while watching a movie or a public
_ television station nature film.

But Cooper, who is assigned to the I

Fitzgerald office of the state Depart-
ment of Natural Resources (DNR), said

coyotes are found today in 130 of Geor- '

:gia’s 159 counties. Coyotes are thriving if

‘ in the coastal plain, the Piedmont pla-

teau and also many areas north of the ,

fall line. , - ..
They apparently haven’t yet extend-

ed their range into the North Georgia
mountains except for some valleys and

rugged terrain in the northwest corner '
near Pigeon Mountain and LaFayette. _ '

Coyotes have even been seen in
counties that have the largest Cities.

DNR wildlife biologistlBob Monroe said ,

there were documented sightings of
coyotes in south Fulton County in 1982.

“The loss of somelivestock in south
Fulton was attributed to coyotes, but I
cannot say for sure,” he said.

How did that howling Texas critter

get to the land of peanuts, magnolias
and largemouth bass?

Wildlife biologists believe coyotes
were released in Georgia, apparently by

hunters, in the 1930s and during the .

. 19505.

 

“Some people thought they
were purchasing red fox but got

1 coyotes,” C00per said. “Red fox
pups and coyote pups are hard to,

tell apart. In the late 1950s, some
were released in South Georgia
that were known to be coyotes.
Hunters wanted to run them with
their dogs.”

Some coyotes likely migrated
to Georgia after being introduced
in Alabama, Tennessee and north-
ern Florida, he said. Coyotes also
are found in many areas of

,_ Mississippi.

“Coyotes will cross with wild
dogs,” Cooper said, “but it is not
so common. It is called a coydog.
Coyotes breed pretty true.”

Cooper, who has studied densi-
ty and distribution of the coyote

population in the state, said the.
. DNR will participate with the Uni-

versity of Georgia in a coyote pro-
ject this 'fall in which radio trans-
mitters will be placed on coyotes
for studies of their movements
and mortality rates.

“The coyote is grayish with
buff on its sides and a black
tipped tail with any variables of
that pattern,” he said. “Very few
people who shoot one say it

weighs less than 40 pounds. But in -

reality, you seldom get one that
big. In Georgia, the males usually
weigh in the mid.205 with an occae

sional one in the 305. Females .

weigh 18 to 25 pounds. They’re not
nearly as big as they look with
their winter coat"

In Texas, the adult male coy-
otes average 36.9 pounds and the
females, 29.9 pounds, while in
Kansas the averages run 28.8
pounds and 24.2 pounds
respectively. _

“You hear them mostly at
night,” Cooper said. “It’s a bunch
of yips and yelps and accompanied
by a few howls. They take advan-
tage of rock piles and dens or go

under old houses. They breed in .
January and February and go to ‘-
the den. Coyotes average four to_
. six pups a litter in the spring.” '

 

 

__. a .
Since the coyote is
common on Western
prairies, most Georgians
probably never have

wolf, except in the mov-

ies or on TV.
—

killed by coyotes, but statewide it
is very low,” Cooper said. “It’s a

. very local situation. In Mitchell
County in the 19705, a big sheep ‘

farmer had a terrible problem un-

, til he learned to trap the coyotes

himself. They would wipe out his

lamb crop completely.”
In a few instances, coyotes

have closely followed a cow in a

. pasture until she gave birth, and

then they seized the calf and ate
it. Adult deer usually can escape

_ from coyotes, but their little fawns

are vulnerable to attacks by the

“ roving predators.

Coyotes have been present

” many years in Twiggs, Houston,

Pulaski, Wilcox, Ben Hill, Turner

. and Dooley counties — a pocket

bounded on the east by the Ocmul-
gee River and the west by the
Flint River. A coyote was seen in

Waycross in 1903, according to
f “Mammals of Georgia,” but it
may have been one that was
, trapped in the West, Couper said.

The biologist emphasized that

‘: coyotes are not. causing problems
: with wildlife populations in Geor-
gia, and instances of farm animals
: being killed are few. The situation
l could change if their density levels

increased significantly.

. “There may be a mortality
"factor affecting them,” he said.
“They don’t seem to be any denser
’ than they were 15 years ago. The
3 general feeling in the Midwest and
. the South is that as the coyote
; population increases, there is a
3 tendency for the red fox pepula-
; tion to decrease. And the reverse

TAMPA TRIBUNE - July 9, 1987

Shelter begins Pets for Peepie pro

By PANKY SNOW
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — If you’re over 60 and
in need of a very special kind of
acceptance and love, you just may
have a free pet waiting for you at
the Humane Society of Tampa Bay,
Inc., 3607 N. Armenia.

Although the animal shelter has
reported it is in dire financial
straits, it has implemented a new
program by the Ralston Purina
Company.

Called the Pets for People Pro-

gram, the $1 million project is
aimed at rescuing 10,000 homeless
dogs and cats from the 90 largest
. shelters in 70 cities across the coun-
, try. Tampa is one of those cities?
At a rate of about 10 a month,
the pets will be placed in homes of
persons over 60, at no cost.

LONDON (ENGLAND) OBSERVER
July 12, 1987

Purina will be providing a free
pet medical checkup that includes
free shots, spaying or neutering; wa-
ter/food bowls; free collar, leash,
pet—care booklet and starter box of
food.

The company also will pay the
usual adoption fees charged by the
Humane Society -- $50 for dogs and
$30 for cats.

Purina reported the program

was started in an effort to provide

both the physical and psychological
benefits of pet ownership 'to those
who might need it most.

Persons 60 or older may call
first and request that the Humane
Society mail them a brochure ex-
plaining the program. Or, they may
go directly to the shelter for infor-
mation.

An adoption application from
both Purina and the Humane Soci-

ety must be completed next. It asks
how the pet will be housed and
cared for, whether the owner lives
in an apartment or a house with a
fenced yard and if the pet will be
able to get enough exercise.

The potential pet owner must al-
so specify the general size and tem-
perament of the adult pet he or she
might prefer.

The only thing asked in return is
that the person looking for a pet
keep an open mind as to breed,
shape and color.

“We are hoping the senior citi-
zens will take a good look at the
older cats and dogs,” said Phil Sny-
der, shelter director.

He pointed out that, since the
older animal generally is more
calm, housebroken and manners-

trained, pets at least a year old are.

Snyder added that often, people
will love a young cat or dog, then
abandon it when the pet gets older.
He said he thinks this program will

pm on pit bulls
as debate rages

, By Jim Morris
.OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

July 6, 1987

9. month, an1mal- control division

C manager Tom Hickey says, but a f
statistical breakdown by breed is

- i not kept. One informal study was

do,ne however, and it showed
that during an 11 month period
beginning in October 1985, pit
bulls accounted for 8.3 percent of
reported bites.

:j Eighteen of the 384 bites —
less than 5 percent — reported in
Arlington during the ﬁrst six
months of this year were attribut-
.ed to pit bulls, said RoseAnna
”Prater, the city’s animal control
pfﬁcer. No statistics were avail-
; able for Fort Worth, but animal
”control supervisor Guy Natale
says that mixed— breed dogs are
" respon51ble for the greatest num-
ber of bites, followed by German
. shepherds, chows and pit bulls

 

 

i To Patricia Luecke, pit bullterriers are blood-
thirsty, soulless creatures that should be outlawed.
f Last month one crashed through the screen door
-. of Luecke’s Richardson home, killed her small dog
j and threatened to maul her l7-month-old son.
. “They’re dangerous dogs,” Luecke says. “They’ve
been bred to ﬁght and that’s all they’ re good for.” _
' Gary Hammonds, who has been breeding pit
bulls for 20 years, says nothing could be further
from the truth. He is president of the Lone Star
State Pit Bull Club in Mansﬁeld and believes they
are marvelous animals —- maybe “the best-bred ‘
dogs on the planet.”

They are intelligent and loyal and make excellent
family dogs, he says, although he admits they are

- “not for everyone. Our problems are coming from
people having them who don’ t need them.”

Thus goes the debate. These muscular, compact
dogs are gaining an increasingly bad reputation, de-
served or not, as a result of unprovoked attacks on
people and animals.

According to the Humane Society of the United
.States, pit bulls were responsible for all ﬁve deaths
caused by dogs in the United States this year. And
of 13 killings by dogs in the past 12 months, the
society says, nine have been by pit bulls. ,

Two recent incidents in particular have drawn
national attention. On June 13, a 21/1- -—year -old boy
was fatally mauled by a neighbor’s pit bull in Mort;
gan Hill, Calif. On June 22, an animal control ofﬁ- {a
cer in Los Angeles was bitten on her chest and both 3;

~ hands as artelevision camera rolled. ‘ 2

These and other episOdes have provoked cries of i

. protest across the country. At last count, more than
. 40 cities either had banned pit bulls or were consid-
l ering doing so. Virtually no animal shelter will put ’

In Hammonds’ opinion, three
things can cause a dog to become
vicious: bad breeding, a bad envi-
ronment or bad luck.

“You’re going to have one go 1’

sour on you every once in a
while,” he says. ‘

Grand Prairie veterinarian Bob
Wilson, who owns ﬁve pit bulls,

says “one rotten apple’s going to ‘

spoil the whole bushel basket. If
they’re going to ban those dogs,
let them ban Dobermans and
shepherds and any dog that
bites.”

'Wilson says he has had pit
bulls since 1970. He raised his
two, children with them and says

he had no trouble.

“You get a pit bull and raise it-
with a family and a child is as
safe crawling around the floor as
it is in its mother’s arms,” Wilson
says. “When my kids were little

“You’re not safe within your

own home,” Luecke says.

Responding to public pressure, 3

dozens of cities are clamping
down on pit bulls. Littleton,
Colo., a suburb of Denver, is ex-
pected to adopt an ordinance that
one of its authors says would be
the most stringent in the nation.

The ordinance, which comes
up for ﬁnal consideration by the
Littleton City Council on
Wednesday, would make, owning
a pit bull a crime, punishable by
a minimum, mandatory ﬁne of
$500. The maximum ﬁne would

. be $999, and the owner also could

receive up to 90 days in jail. Each
day the dog remained within the
city limits would constitute a sep-
arate offense.

Barry Segal, an assistant city
attorney in Littleton, says the
propOsed ordinance was drawn
up last fall “in the wake of re-
peated newspaper articles about

fatal mauling of a 3eyear-old Den-
ver child in October. This spring,
Littleton had two pit bull attacks
of its own, fueling the ﬁre for a
ban on the animal.

- “It was the staff’s position that '
animals such as these are not
suited for residential neighbor- .

hoods, just as various laws pro—

hibit the keeping of lions or tigers i
as household pets,” Segal says.

Telephone calls to the city at-
torney’s office, he says, have
been running about 2-to-1 in fa-

—-‘ notably, the '

 

» America’s rarest mammal, has in-
creased to 25 with the recent birth of
eight kits, six in one litter and two in
another (one of the two died), in a cap-
tivity breeding program of the Wy-
oming Game and Fish Department.

_- , The species was believed to be ex-
tinct until 1981 , when a colony of about
35 was found in northwestern Wyo-
ming. The ferrets largely disappeared
due to the widespread killing of prairie
dogs, one of their main food sources.

‘The colony was again almost wiped
out in 1985 by an epidemic of canine
distemper. That was when the Game
and Fish Department intervened and
captured the 22 surviving ferrets for an
attempt to breed them in captivity.
(Some have since died.)

The ﬁnal stage of the program will

' be to reintroduce the ferrets into the wild
when the colony reaches a population
of about 500. Since black-footed ferrets
usually produce one litter of three to six
kits per year, the projected target year
for release is 1991.

Before they are released, the ferrets
will live in prairie dog colonies set up
by the department’s Sybille Wildlife Re-
search Center so they can learn the hunt-
ing skills necessary for survival.

According to Don Kwiatkowski, a
biologist specializing in captive breed-
ing for the department, ferrets in the
wild have a high mortality rate because
they leave the mother six months after
birth and are often unable to defend
themselves or ﬁnd food.

The recent litters were born of two
of the nine female ferrets bred in captiv-
ity; it is not yet known if any of the
others are pregnant.

Costa couple’s crusade *
to rescue beach chimps

NINE young chimpanzees,
rescued from Spanish beach
photographers by a retired
British couple, begin a new
life in a West Country
wildlife park tomorrow.

Although an endangered
species protected under both
Spanish and European law,
some 200 chimpanzees are
estimated to be working the
beaches and bars of Spain.

Simon and Peggy Templar
began their crusade to rescue
the beach chimps six years ago
when their daughter persuaded
them to buy one from a pet
shop because ‘it looked so
pathetic.’ Since then 27 have
passed through their ‘reha-
bilitation centre’ in the hills
near Barcelona.

The Templars have been
attacked by photographers,
received death threats from
smugglers of the chimps from
West Africa, and been ordered
to hand back confiscated
chimps by the Spanish courts
under arcane property laws.

Mrs Templar, ()7, said: ‘It
is heartbreaking. The chimps
come to us in a terrible state
.—— addicted to drugs, some
covered in cigarette burns,
some virtually bald where the
clothes they have been forced
to wear rub their hair off.
Most are confused and take
years to rehabilitate’

The last chimpanzee, Sam,
was handed over to the
_'l‘cmplars 18 months ago.
None were confiscated by the
authorities last season.

lived in Spain for 37 years,

THE COST of a snap with a
Costa chimp is 1,000 pesetas
e—about £5. For eight-year-
old Shawn Asquith from
Barnsley, Yorkshire, who was
bitten by one last month, it
meant a ruined holiday and a
series of unpleasant injec-
tions.

A photographer thrust a
chimpanzee into Shawn’s
arms outside a Benidorm
bar and tried to take his
picture.

The chimpanzee—drugged
and dressed in children’s
clothes—bit Shawn on the
lip. Last week, a month after
returning home, Shawn had
the sixth of a course of seven
painful anti-rabies injec-
tions.

Susan Asquith, Shawn’s
mother, said : "He was walk-
ing ahead of us and the chimp
was put on him before he
could do anything. We’d
already been accosted by
other photographers with

‘If you say you don’t want

reach Spain 10 will have died.
Poachers who catch them in
the wild shoot the adults in the
group before taking the young.

After arriving in Spain, the
chimps have their front teeth
broken off with pliers and are
set to work. They are drugged
to subdue them, worked 16
hours a day—and eventually
thrown into the sea when they
are no longer cute enough to
attract the tourists.

Before Spain joined the EC
and agreed to abide by the
Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species
the chimps were confiscated
under hygiene laws. Having
been smuggled out of West
Africa, they had not been
quarantined or vaccinated
against infectious diseases.

But in several cases the
photographers took the Tem-
plars to court, and it was ruled
that property laws took
precedence. ’

Jim Cronin, an American
zoologist working on the
Monkey World project and
who used to look after the
primates at John Aspinall’s '
zoo, said: ‘ Our aim is to put
an end to the problem within
five years. We will take as
many chimpanzees as the
Spanish authorities can
confiscate. ’

Monkey World and Jane
Goodall, a world authority on
primates, will shortly launch
an appeal to raise £500,000 to
save other Spanish chimps and
bring them to Dorset.

As many as 20 chimpanzees
are believed to be working in
Benidorm, a popular destina-

 

 




 

 

 

Monkey business: Peggy Templar at her rehabilitation centre in Gerona, with a chimp rescued l

tion with British holiday-
makers. The photographers
work in pairs: one to hold the
chimp and one to take the
picture. Often the chimpanzee
. is thrust into the tourist’s arms
and the picture taken before
they realise what is happening.

They then demand payment,
whether or not the photograph
is wanted.

Last Wednesday night was
typical. The chimpanzees,
dressed in everything from
football kit to baby clothes and
Spanish national costume, were
dragged along by the paw,

looking bewildered and lost.
When our photographer,
posing as a tourist, took a

in the street, he was told
angrily: ‘ Eh, don’t be

then demanded money for the
photograph. The team refused

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

rThank you for taking the time to write me with your concerns about
hunting and trapping on land owned by the federal government.

I certainly agree that we should do all we can to protect our
wildlife. I have heard from several constituents who, like you, are
outraged that these practices are allowed and even encouraged in our
National Parks and Wildlife Refuges, and I am happy to report that
Senator Cranston has introduced S.J.Res. 12, which would establish a
national policy for hunting and trapping on federal lands.

This bill would allow hunting and trapping on public lands only
with the written approval of the appropriate Cabinet Secretary, after
sufficient opportunity for public comment, and only if such act1V1t1es
will maintain the species at a level consistent with its role in the
ecosystem and in the public interest. This bill is pending in the
Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and I am looking
forward to its being reported out to the full Senate.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your concern about the Bureau of
Land Management (BLM) policy on wild horses and burros. I am sgrry
that my move from the House to the Senate has so greatly degaye my ed
response, and I assure you that future correspondence W111 e answer
in a more timely fashion. ‘

ainl understand our concern about this issue. As you
know? EEEtthisyspring annougced that it would reSC1nd 1ts f1ve year
old policy of maintaining Wild horses and burros until they are f
adOpted. Under the new policy, BLM W111 hold rounded-up animads or
90 days while making attempts to have them adopted by qua11f1e.f t
individuals, but these horses and burros W111 be put to death 1 nold
adopted. In the current fiscal year, almost 5,000 such animals cou
be killed by lethal injection.

In response to public opinion, Congress is taking act1on tﬁ halt
the implementation of this policy in future years. The House .asl des
finished work on the appropriations D111 cover1ng BLM, and 1; inc u
language prohibiting the BLM from us1ng any such funds for t etheir
extermination of healthy, unadopted W1ld horses and burros in
care. This bill has been referred to the Senate Appropr1at1ons t
Committee, and priority has been placed on Its reach1ng the Sena e
floor as soon as possible. I can assure you that I W111 keep your
thoughts in mind when this bill is before me.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for writing to me with yOur concerns about clear cutting in
our National Forests.

I share your concern about this issue. As you may know, I have a very
strong legislative record on protecting the environment, and in these days
of enormous federal budget deficits, any issue that would save taxpayers
money and preserve the environment deserves the attention of Congress.

I serve on the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the Senate Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources, and we plan to hold oversight hearings on
national forest planning later this fall. The National Forest Management
Act, passed by Congress in 1976, regulates clear-cutting in National
Forests, and some of my colleagues are planning amendments to further
restrict this practiCe. You can be certain that I will keep your thoughts
in mind as we consider this issue.

You may also be interested to know that Senator Proxmire has introduced
a bill, S. 708, to eliminate the permanent subsidy enjoyed by loggers 1n
the Tongass National Forest in Alaska and to restrict the areas in Wthh '
clear-cutting can be done there. My subcommittee may hold hearings on thlS
bill in the near future, and I look forward to reviewing it at greater
length.

I certainly share your interest in ensuring that our unique natural '
habitats are pr0perly protected. Our wilderness areas are among America s
greatest treasures, and we must preserve these lands and the Wildlife that
inhabit them for future generations. Again, thank you for keeping me

informed of your concerns.

A Mean Breed or a Defamed Pooch?

AS. ClAIES

Some have urged a ban 0 pit bulls.
SUMMARY: The pit bull, a breed
with a made-to-ﬁght bloodline,
has fallen on hard times. Once a
popular all-American symbol, the
dog Is now getting bad publicity
for its ferocity. Defenders blame
owners, improper training and
cases of mistaken identity for the
pit bull’s blackened image; others
say the dog is by nature a killer.

3,... ust before Halloween four years ago,
the little town of Harper, Kan. , was
shattered by the brutal killing of
Grace Parson. It’s a day Police Chief
A.E. “Ed” Starks will never, forget: He
found her mauled and nearly lifeless body
being dragged across her yard by two dogs,
an attack he ﬁgures had been going on
about 45 minutes.

At ﬁrst, recalls Starks, he did not rec-
ognize Grace Parson as the 67-year-old
nurse’s aide who once had taken care of
him after a heart attack; her scalp had been
chewed off. “I had seen dog bites, but I
have never seen anything like that,” he says.
“I’ve worked suicides and homicides, and

I don’t believe I’ve ever seen that kind of
destruction.” The dogs, the only two pit
bull terriers in town, were trained to attack
anyone with a weapon. Parson, who died
in the hospital, had been carrying a rolled-
up newspaper.

Early last month, 2-year-old James Soto
of Morgan Hill, Calif. , wandered from
home and was missing for only a few min-
utes when his father found him —— pinned
under a neighbor’s pit bull that was still on
its chain. The child died of severe bite
wounds on his face and neck. Paramedics
reportedly said he was so badly mauled,
“he was unrecognizable as a human being.”

In Los Angeles later last month, during
a grisly attack captured on television, a pit
bull named Benjamin burst through the
screen door of a house and sank his teeth
into animal control ofﬁcer Florence
Crowell, crushing one hand and severely
injuring the other. The dog was beaten
back, only to attack again, this time biting
the woman’s chest. She had gone to the
house to investigate a report of an earlier
attack by the dog.

In December 1984, a pit bull in Davie,
Fla. , killed a sleeping infant after the dog

crawled into the child’s crib. A 4-year-old

boy in Decatur, Ga., was killed last No-
vember by three pit bulls when he and
another child walked across a neighbor’s
lawn. In April, a l6—month—old girl in
Jones, Okla. , died of severe throat wounds
after wandering near a chained pit bull.

One of the most gruesome incidents
took place in May, when William Eckman,
a 67-year-old retired physician, was killed
in Dayton, Ohio, by two pit bulls in an
attack lasting 25 minutes. One witness tried
to run over the dogs with a car, to no avail.

The victims of pit bull attacks are rarely
healthy young men, as the animals seem to
prefer weaker, slower prey. Most fatalities
have involved children who come too close;
many times the victims are elderly.

According to the Humane Society of the
United States, so far this year, ﬁve persons
have been killed by dogs, directly or in-
directly (one man died of a heart attack
while ﬂeeing); in each case the animal was
a pit bull. Last year, says Randall Lock-
wood, an animal behaviorist with the soci-
ety, pit bulls were responsible for seven of
the 13 dog-related deaths in the nation.

Across the country, the pit bull has made
a name for itself: the Mean Breed.

Mean it may be, but the compact, oval-
headed dog known for its powerful, vice—
like jaws and to-the-death ﬁghting instinct
is also becoming increasingly popular
across the country as a pet.

At one time, the pit bull was an all-
American dog, its likeness turning up on
everything from soft drink advertisements
to product logos. Petey, the . ring-eyed
mascot of the Little Rascals, was a pit bull,
as is the Buster Brown dog. Writer James
Thurber’s favorite , Rex , was a pit bull. Says
one breeder, “This used to be Joe Blow’s
dog.”
But Joe Blow’s pet is fast becoming a
public nuisance —— canine non grata. Many
pit bulls are trained from birth to attack and
ﬁght. In some rural areas, especially in the
South, they are thrown in deep, blood-
splattered pits with other dogs as com-
batants in high-stakes dogﬁghts. In many
cities, the pit bull has joined leather jackets
and fast cars as macho status symbols.

Has man’s best friend turned on him? Is
the pit bull, bred as a ﬁghting dog, vicious
and unpredictable, a menace to man, or are
a few ill—tempered dogs simply ruining it
for the whole breed? Many owners insist
there is no sweeter pooch, that the problem
is irresponsible breeding and improper
training, while others argue that the dogs
are intractable and should be banned.

“By nature of their breeding and their
training they are meant to attack, at least to
attack other animals,” says Tina Harper,
chief of animal disease control for the Dis-

trict of Columbia’s Department of Human

Services. “They have very strong jaws.
Once they latch onto something, they don’t
let go. They are more likely to attack, and
once they do they’re more likely to inﬂict
serious damage.”

The pit bull originated in the early 19th
century when a small, aggressive dog was
bred with a larger, stronger dog to create
the ideal ﬁghting machine. At ﬁrst, the
dogs were used as bait during bull and bear
ﬁghts; later they were turned on each other.
While many pit bull advocates dispute the
claim, one former dog breeder says the
killer instinct is in their blood. “If you pick
them up when they’re 3 days old, they’ll
grow] at you. I’ve never known any other
dogs to do that.”

The dog’s physiology, combined with
what many see as its volatile nature, makes
the pit bull a formidable contender —— in or
out of the pit. Their bodies are solid and
muscular, their jaws wide and remarkably
strong. “They look just like sharks feeding
when they go on the attack. Their tenacity
is tremendous,” says Starks, who tells of '
once seeing a pit bull pop a tennis ball with
one bite.

“When they bite, they rip,” says the
former breeder. “The only time they let go
is when the ﬂesh is ripped off, and then

 




they bite again.” One woman in Long Is-
land reportedly thought her neighbor’s pit
bull was vicious because it liked to hang by
its teeth from a tree limb.

The dogs also have been known to dis-
play extraordinary, sometimes supernat-
ural, feats of strength or endurance. Pit
bulls at one city’s animal shelter routinely
chewed through the chain link fence that
separated the dogS, forcing replacement of
the fence with cinder block barriers. One
pit bull attacked an Afghan hound through
the fence; the Afghan was so badly mauled
it had to be put to sleep.

Last AugUSt, a man in Paterson, N.J.,
who ordered his pit bull to attack pOlice
was convicted of possession of a deadly
weapon: his dog. That same month in
Arlington, TeXas, a man shot an attacking
pit bull three times in the head with a
.22-caliber pistol. According to The Asso-
ciated Press, “The bullets merely bounced
off the dog’s skull.” The pit bull withdrew
from the encounter and lay down.

Scores of cornmUnities around the coun-
try have tried to adopt legislation to control
pit bulls, but many such laws have been
struck down in court as too vague.

Florida’s Broward County, where Davie
is located, adopted a general vicious—dog
ordinance in May after two attempts at a
more speciﬁc law against pit bulls failed to
hold up in court. The original law, which
lasted barely two weeks, imposed strict
guidelines for pit bull owners, requiring

them to muzzle and leash their dogs when .

taking them in public and hold a $1 million
liability insurance policy for them. The
new law requires a $100,000 policy, which
many companies are reluctant to write.

“In my experience, if anybody around
here tells an insurance company they have
what’s been determined a vicious dog,
they’d better go across the ocean to Lloyd’s
of London. They’re not going to get insur-
ance here,” says Rick Collord, executive
director of the Broward County Humane
Society.

Just weeks ago the Los Angeles City
Council passed a law, also after a long
controversy, allowing for the impounding
of any animal that has bitten a human.

Opponents of breed-speciﬁc laws argue
that the problem is with the owners, not the
dogs. “If you’ve got someone on death row,
don’t conﬁscate the whole family,” says
Andy Johnson, manager of breed ﬁeld op-
erations for the United Kennel Club, which
is ﬁghting for laws that address vicious
dogs of any breed.

“If you’re raising pit bulls like you
should, you’re going to have one of the
nicest pets you can imagine,” insists John—
son. “They’re just a super, super little dog,
. . . and they just love to be around people.’

In many cases, he says, problems with
identiﬁcation cause pit bulls to take the rap
for attacks by other breeds. Adding to the
confusion is the debate between the Amer-
ican Kennel and United Kennel clubs.
American Kennel recognizes and registers
the American Staffordshire tenier, which
United Kennel views as the same animal
and registers as the American pit bull ter—
rier. In addition, “pit bull” is often used as
a blanket reference to not only the Amer-
ican pit bull terrier and American Stafford-
shire tenier but also the Staffordshire bull
terrier, bulldog, bullterrier, Boston terrier,
boxer and others.

Pit bull defenders also blame media

Petey of Little Rascals fame reminds of a time when pit bulls were in great favor.

hype for the current pit bull hysteria. John-
son argues that the bite of the pit bull is no
worse than that of many other dogs, citing
as evidence a recent study in West Palm
Beach, Fla. , showing that the pit bull
ranked seventh in bite severity by breed (the
chow chow, rottweiler and cocker spaniel
were at the top).

Many owners and animal control of—
ﬁcials dismiss the notion that the pit bull is
inherently savage.

“I think it’s fun for people to say, ‘Oh,
my goodness, vicious pit bull!’ ” says
Vicki Hearne, an author and former dog
trainer who lives with two pit bulls in West-
brook, Conn. “But there’s always some
breed that is the bloodthirsty one at any
given time. . . They’re scrappy, but
they’re not people-mean.” Publicity has en-
couraged people to train their pit bulls to
attack, says Hearne. And although the dOgs
were bred as ﬁghters, in the past any ten-
dency to attack humans was not tolerated,
as man and dog went in the pit together;

A New York breeder says the ﬁlm
“Flashdance,” which featured a pet pit bull,
is partly behind a recent surge‘in the dog’s
popularity. Usually When a breed becomes
the rage, she adds, too many people begin
breeding them, ruining the bloodline. "

“These dogs have; fallen into unscrupu-
lous hands, because “at one time they were
a well-respected breed,” she Says. “If you
don’t pay attention to a breeding program,
you’re going to end up with dogs With
mush for brains no matter what’ the breed.”

Is the pit bull the ﬁercest dog alive?
While the debate continues elsewhere,:-at
least one man in Harper, Kari. , has been
convinced. “I love édogs,” police chief
Starks insists, “but I am scar to deathrof
pit bulls. Scared to death. I’m 6 feet tall
and weigh 207 pounds, but I guarantee you
I’ll back down from a pit bull.” ‘

og’s loyalty paid  
errnanent tribute

Missouri toWn proud ‘of Old Drum statue

a:
f;

By Eliot Kleinberg

W to, The News

“ WARRENSBURG, Mo. .— In the
phnter of this western Missouri town
Stands the statue of a dog named Old
Hrumgln life, said some, he was a
{spot-licking, egg-sucking, flea-bitten
mongrel.” In death, he did for dogs
what Virginia did for Santa Claus.

.. What made Old Drum a symbol of
ifMan’s Best Friend” was a 400-word
closing argument delivered in 1870
at the civil trial of his alleged killer.
That short speech, engraved on the
Statue’s pedestal, embodied a dog’s
loyalty to his master and moved a
étown to erect a permanent monu-
ment to that love.

“Anyone that comes through
Warrensburg always looks up Old
prum,” said Genevra Salsbury, presi-
i‘gient of the Johnson County Histori-
cal Society, in this town of 14,000
Ebout 50 miles east of Kansas City.
:ﬂYou/see them out there taking pic-
gures of the statue every day of the
Week.” .

L‘: Dr. Roy Stubbs, curator of the
bounty historical society and a pro-
fessor at Central Missouri State Uni-
;versity in Warrensburg, said the
Statue appeals to everyone.

“Dog lovers can enjoy it,” said
Stubbs. “Lawyers enjoy it. Cynics
can enjoy it because, after all, he
says so many finer things can be
said about dogs than people.”

In 1869, Old Drum was a 5-year-old
black and tan hunting dog who
chased game in the creeks and
woods of western Missouri, an area
that was trying to recover from the
ravages of anarchy the Civil War
had brought to the Midwest.

Farmer and hunter Charles Bur-
den said Old Drum was the best deer
dog he’d ever owned —— a loyal, faith-
ful treasure. No money could buy
him.

About two miles from Burden’s .

house was the home of his brother-
in-law, Leonidas Hornsby _— a wiry
redhead who lost butter, milk, and
more than 100 sheep and cattle to
prowling dogs in the summer and
fall of 1869. Hornsby declared he

dogs later returned from their night
prowling -—- except Old Drum. The

‘ next morning, Burden found his dog

shot to death along the banks of
nearby Big Creek. He vowed “satis-
faction at the cost of my life.”

The prime suspect Was" “‘Lon” _
Hornsby. He admitted he had heard
a dog prowling in his yard and had
told a boarder of his to shoot it, but
denied it was Old Drum. Ironically, !
Hornsby liked dogs; he OWned many

and had even hunted many times
' with Old Drum.

Burden sued Hornsby, and the;

two became obsessed with their dis-~
.pute.

“The feeling we have with Bur-
den,” said Stubbs. “is that ‘you just
don’t shoot my dog and get away
with it.’ Here’s a man who was going
to put his money where his mouth is.
And those people were so rare.”

The first trial ended in a hung
jury; the second with a $25 ruling for
Burden. Hornsby appealed, and the
verdict was reversed in a third trial.

Burden then claimed to have
found new evidence, and a fourth
trial was ordered. It began in Octo-
ber 1870, in the old Johnson County
Courthouse in nearby Warrensburg.

Both sides hired prominent law-
yers. The trial drew considerable at-
tention, and the town of 1,200 was
jammed with the curious. As it
wrapped up, it appeared that Burden
—- and Old Drum —— would lose for
lack of evidence. Then Burden’s
laywer, George Graham Vest, stood
to speak.

‘Gentleman of the jury: the best
friend a man has in this world may
turn against him and become his en-
emy,” declared Vest. “His son or
daughter that he has reared with

~ loving care may prove ungrateful.

‘. . . Those who are nearest and
dearest to us . . . may become trai-
tors to their faith.”

But, he said, “The one absolutely
unselfish friend that a man can have
in this selfish world; the one that
never deserts and the one that never

. proves ungrateful or treacherous is

his dog.”

The dog, said Vest, stands by its
master “in prosperity and in pov-
erty, and in health, and in sickness.”
The dog “will sleep on the cold
ground . . . if only he may be near
his master’s side. He will kiss the
hand that has no food to offer. . . .

;,- He guards the sleep of his pauper
master as if he were a prince.

“The one absolutely
;' unselfish friend that a
man can have in this

 

selfish world . . . is his

dog.” .

-— George Graham Vest,
1870 trial lawyer

 

 




 

“When all other friends desert he
.. remains. When riches take wings
:7 and reputation falls to pieces, he is
g as confident in his love as the sun in
9 its journey through its heavens.”
; Even when death takes its mas~
ter, “there by his graveside will the
noble dog be found, his head be-
; tween his paws, his eyes sad but
7” open in alert watchfulness, faithful
and true even to death.”

The jury deliberated for only a
few minutes before ruling for Bur-
den and ordering Hornsby to pay
$50. More appeals were filed, but
Burden was finally upheld by the

. Missouri Supreme Court.

g. .. In the years that followed, the
legend of Old Drum grew because
there had been no stenographer dur-

ing the dramatic speech, and Vest -- '

who had served in the Missouri leg-
islature and Confederate Congress
and after the trial became a US. sen-
ator for 24 years -— helped recon-
struct it for posterity, reportedly em-
bellishing it. He later used the
speech in campaign literature.

“It (the speech) got printed in
text useful for school students to re-
cite,” said Stubbs. “It was a favorite
elocution piece for young men and
women. Then lawyers, in their stud-
ies, were reminded about how to win
a case without evidence, and the

‘ value of a jury plea.”

Eventually, newspapers around
the country began running the
piece, and its reputation grew, In
time, the story of Old Drum and the
dramatic monologue touched dog
_, lovers around the world.

Finally, in the World War II era,
' an effort grew to memorialize Old
Drum. PeOple sent stones to Missouri
from every state, Mexico, Africa, the
...Caribbean, Europe, and the Great
. Wall of China. On Dec. 12, 1947, a
monument made of the stones was
placed on the creek banks where Old .
Drum had been found. Imbedded in
it were 50 silver dollars, represent-
ing Hornsby’s payment.
But vandals stole the coins and
the stones, and the monument fell
, into disrepair. Eventually, adrive
. began to establish a statue of Old
a? Drum at the courthouse. Said one
; contributor: “My dog’s not worth a
. dollar, but I wouldn’t take a million
1 bucks for him.” i
E ' The statue was dedicated Sept 23,
, 1958, where it still stands, Old Drum
' standing guard for dog lovers every?

' Beer‘promoting dog
is a happenin’ dude

By Barbara Lippert

. Adweek

This is about Spuds, the pointy-

eared promoter of Bud Light. Spuds

MacKenzie is a bull terrier with the
kind of long face (including one
black eye) that gets immediate
“ooh-oohs” from anyone who sees
him. Spuds, the focus of six
commericals, is a big, big star; I
would say he’s neck and neck with
Jon Bon Jovi. '

In the spots, he rides in cars and
boats and on skateboards. He’s al-

- ways in motion, the way Lee Iacocca

used to walk through Chryslercom-
mercials. Standing up, dressed in
human togs, he tends to look like an
extremely short, narrow-should-
ered guy who, by dint of his person-
ality, still slays the women. We were
introduced to him some time ago,
When he appeared in a striped, one-
piece bathing suit -— a variation of
the kind men wore in the ’208 -— sit-
ting on a float in a pool, surrounded
by gorgeous babes. These babes are
the leitmotif surrounding each exe-
cution. Foremost in his life as a
beer-promoting dog are the three
women called The Spudettes, who
show up, shake and sing along the
lines of “Go, Spuds, go.” There also
- tend to be many Spuds groupies
around.

Spuds’s name is interesting; it

 

“p” seems thrown in to connote
g “h0ps” and make it sound funny.

4 In the course of his career, we’ve
seen Spuds in various outfits
(denim shirt and string tie,
Hawaiian shirt and sunglasses,
white dinner jacket and black bow
tie). In this newest Spot, Spuds goes
back to his vaguely nautical start,
showing up in his own submarine
(we know he’s in the water as his
periscope goes up) and climbing
aboard a wild yacht, something like
the Monkey Business. Outfitted as a
ship’s captain, complete with silk
ascot, he line dances with the afore-
. mentioned babes. In fact,in this lat-
est spot, he’s wedged between two
of them, pushing into and pawing

seems to be a neutralized blend of _
. “suds,” as in beer, and “stud,” as in
‘ what most collegeage beer-drink-
. ing guys fantasize about being. The

' drinking, or anyone nearly sloshed.

Spuds MacKenzie
l
the hips of the woman in front.

To add to the campy, cartoon
quality of the whole moment (we
are, after all, watching a dressed-up
dog doing tricks), the announcer
throughout is Robin Leach. He’s the
only man around who can stretch
the word “lifestyles” out to about
seven syllables and 10 seconds, and
he sustains that quality here, tell-
ing us in his frantic, hyped-up way
that Spuds is “one party-lovin’ '
happenin’ dude.” .

Why is the crazy idea of a ladies’
dog promoting beer so popular? ,
Think of how limited beer ad-
vertisers are: They can’t show any-
one young, or anyone actually

 

The brilliance of this campaign, by
contrast, is that Spuds comes off as
the embodiment, the visual meta- ;
phor for a state of pleasant inebria-
tion. He’s a lot more appealing than
that frat rat in a Hawaiian shirt and
sunglasses, the life of the party
who, when having drunk enough,
might even crawl through the door
on all fours, to applause. (You re-_
member Animal House.)

In another smart stroke, the use
of a dog frees women to say amaz-
ingly provocative things to him.
Spuds is a dog who gives men hope.

will make a hot August at the zoo

It sounds like a baseball trade:
“Woody, Lisa and the hard-hitting
Dinga of Memphis will be sent to
Mexico City in exchange for the extra-
thumbed Qiu-Hua and several keepers
to be named later.”

Although it involves animals rather
than ballplayersﬁhe transaction is one
of the hottest ever made by an
American 200, even if the key figure in
the deal is only on loan.

Qiu-Hua (pronounced shoe wah) is
“dandelion" in Chinese, and in any
language is a 220-pound female giant
panda that will arrive July 30 for a one-
month stay at the Memphis Zoo.
Throughout August some 250,000
visitors are expected to view 2-year-old
Qiu-Hua, whose home is the
Chapultepec Park Zoo in Mexico City.

In return, the Memphis Zoo is giving
orangutans Woody and Lisa and gorilla
Dinga to the Mexico City zoo on July 20
for keeps. '

“It’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing,” said
Trish Tolbert, executive director of the
Memphis Zoological Society. “This is
the first panda to be exhibited in the
southeastern United States.”

The $200,000 cost for the panda .
exchange program includes $140,000
being underwritten by Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. of Memphis for 200
construction and renovation here for
the panda and in Mexico for the
orangutans and gorilla, she said.

The remaining $60,000 for, travel,
graphics, educational material,
horticultural material and other costs
is being raised by Memphis Zoo Inc., the
parent of the Memphis Zoological
Society.

“We’re looking for donations of $5,000
or more to be official sponsors," said

 

 

Ms. Tolbert, adding that Federal
Express and American Airlines are
providing transportation for the event.

Qiu-Hua will arrive July 30 by Federal
Express and will be on public display at
the zoo daily from 9 am. to 5 pm.
beginning Saturday Aug. 1, she said. A
special panda ceremony - perhaps a
ribbon-cutting or balloon launching —-
will be held at 9:30 an. Aug. 1 at the zoo.

Qiu-Htia will live in the Primate
House where $85,000 has been spent
turning a gorilla’s concrete jungle into
a panda palace, including a grassy field
with a pool. A 12-foot wall is being built
around the outside of the exhibit and
includes 10 panes of laminated safety
glass that will, provide visitors with
more than 40 feet of viewing space.

A metal playground “pagoda” —— a
circular jungle gym with a Chinese roof
-— will replace the outdoor monkey

the Chapultepec Park Zoo in Mexico City during August.

Zoo director Charles Wilson
said the special digs are 85 per-
cent complete and likely will be
finished by next weekend.
Qiu-Hua, Whose care will be su-
pervised by her Mexican
keepers, likely will spend morn-
ings outside and afternoons in-
doors. The visitors’ line will go
through the Primate House and
outside so both parts of the pan-
da’s home will be visible.
Gorillas Rocky, Tammy and

_Ward Stone

Pathologist’s mission
is to savewildlife
from killer chemicals

By Mary Esch
Of The Associated Press
' DELMAR, N.Y.

N WARD STONE’S collection of wildlife
slides, there are no playful otters, no soaring
eagles -— just disturbing images of death.

There are songbirds hanging grotesquely in a
hedge row, like litter blown in the wind.

“We did postmorterns in the field,” said Stone,
showing the slides in a darkened office. The
cause of death: poisoned rye spread by a farmer
to kill blackbirds eating his corn. In all, 3,194
birds of 13 species were killed.

There is a slide of brant geese piled like
autumn leaves along a golf-course fairway. “The
groundskeeper applied diazinon,” a popular
beetle-grub pesticide, Stone said. “The brant
came to feed on the grass; 700 dead.”

There is the stiff body of a robin, brought to
Stone by a woman who found it in tremors in an
apple orchard. “At first, we suspected ‘
malathion,” Stone said. “It turned out to be DDT
poisoning.”

“There are tens of thousands of acres where
DDT (now banned) was applied heavily,” he said,
“and a lot of it is still there, still killing birds.”

In the quarter-century since Rachel Carson
exposed the ecological hazards of DDT and other
pesticides in her book “Silent Spring,” the use of
pesticides in the United States has risen from
about 540 million pounds in 1964 to more than 1
billion pounds annually, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.

As wildlife pathologist for New York state’s
Department of Environmental Conservation,
Stone sees the side-effects of those chemical
killers.

Much of the work done on Stone’s shining steel
table is routine: raccoons with distemper, deer
shot out of season, muskrats with giardia
parasites, infestations of nematodes, tapeworms
and lice.

But Stone sees himself as more than a
technician doing autopsies. He is a man with a
mission, inspired by the death and disease he has
seen in 18 years of pathology work.

, Stone has developed a reputation as an
effective catalyst for environmental reform.

“Wildlife is an important monitor of the
environment,” Stone said in his office at the state
Department of Environmental Conservation’s
Wildlife Resource Center in rural Delmar, south
of Albany. “Changes in animal populations,
sickness, death, may be telling us there could be
problems for us as well."

The walls of Stone’s cramped office are
covered with plaques and plaudits from
environmental groups in recognition of his
crusades against pollutants.

The 48-year-old scientist — a stocky, bearish
figure 1n rumpled lab coat jeans and rubber
moccasins — frequently' 1s invited to bring his
morbid slide show to meetings of wildlife groups
such as the Audubon Society

“He' 5 got a heck of a constituency among
environmentalists,” said Ron Dodson, an
Audubon lobbyist 1n Albany. “He’ 5 been at the
leading edge of effecting change 1n the regulation
of pesticides and other toxic substances at both
the state and federal level.”

Most recently, Stone was inﬂuential in
getting the EPA to cancel approval for the use of

research. Stone has been a catalyst for environmental reform.

diazinon on golf courses and sod farms last
September.

According to the EPA, an estimated 512,000
pounds of diazinon is used annually on golf
courses. More than 86 incidents of diazinon-
related bird kills across the country have been
reported to the agency.

Ingrid Sunzenauer, the EPA’s review manager _

for diazinon in Washington, says Stone gathered
data from around the United States, providing
“most of our; database showing the bird kills."

Stone was among the first to warn of
widespread contamination from polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs — industrial organochlorine
compounds suspected of causing cancer and
other ills. ‘

“At first, it fell largely on deaf ears,” he said.
“I’d propose studies, but they wouldn’t be acted
on.” He says he wrote 102 memos on the subject
between 1970 and 1975, but state officials didn't
pay attention until a federal scientist warned of
PCBs in the Hudson River in 1975.

“They accused me of not stating my concerns
strongly enough, of writing my memos at
unintelligible tables,” Stone said.

That’s when he decided to speak more
stridently about environmental hazards -— and to
take matters into his own bends when he felt so
moved.

In 1982, a Saratoga County schoolteacher
brought him a mayonnaise jar of soil from a dirt
road that smelled of chemicals. “1 went up to do
some testing, but I came under fire from the
bureaucrats,” Stone said. “So I did my
postmortems by day, and went up and dug holes
by night.” It turned out the town highway
department had used PCB-contaminated oil to
reduce road dust.

Soon after that, some Saratoga County
residents invited Stone to a citizens meeting in

v.

Moreau to discuss a site where General Electric
Co. had dumped chemicals for two decades.
“When I got to the house, I could smell the PCBs
in the yard,” he said.

DeSpite warnings from the state DEC
commissioner that he was treading on another
bureau's turf, Stone undertook a study around the
house. The analysis of grass, pine needles,
beetles, frogs, shrews and other flora and fauna
documented the flow of PCBs from the nearby
dump through the food chain. GE ultimately
bought the land,~bulldozed the house and
removed tons of contaminated soil. And Stone
won an award from the Wildlife Society.

‘ Stone also has testified to the hazards of
organochlorine pesticides such as DDT, mirex,
endrin, heptachlor and chlordane, which, like
PCBs, are persistent in the environment and toxic
to wildlife.

Contamination problems and the evolution of
resistant insects led to a switch from
organochlorine pesticides to other compounds,
such as malathion, diazinon, Sevin and Furadan.
Those organophosphate and carbamate
compounds break down faster — but they are
more toxic when first applied.

Stone’s files are crammed with reports
documenting the deadly effects of compounds

' commonly used on lawns.

"I don’t see any indication that we are really
dealing with the pollution problems in any
effective manner, ” he said.

“Take diazinon. It’s a small issue overall; but
here’s a case of a highly toxic substance that’s
clearly killing birds, and it took 17 years to start
dealing witnthe problem. So when you get into
things that‘are more subtle than outright death,
and where the analyses are more difficult and
expensive than diazinon, it seems likely to me
that the environment may get worse before it gets
better. ” \

Firm cans Worker who refused
t0 stop feeding Stray-cat horde}

gay CAROL MCGRAW
VLos Angeles Times

--” ‘ BURBANK, Calif. — They 'call’

. her the "Cat Lady of Lockheed.”

And for more years than she can
remember, she has risen every
morning at 2 am, brewed herself a
cup of coffee, loaded her car trunk
with cases of canned cat food and
headed out on her self-avowed
mission of mercy. ' '

In the dawn, before most day-
shift workers at the Burbank aero-
space company are even awake,
69-year—old Marie Newberry would
make her rounds at the plant.

Stopping in the parking lot and
in certain equipmentstorage areas,
she would laboriously open can
after can after can of food for the
scores of wild cats who live at the
plant. Then, at 7 am, her mission
complete, she would go to her post
at Lockheed, where for the last 45
years she has worked bending sheet
metal into parts for airplanes.

Two weeks ago, Newberry, who
had worked longer than almost
anybody at one of the most techni-
cally demanding jobs in the plant,
was fired, not for her job perfor-

- mance, which management said
was exemplary, but because she
refused to stop feeding the cats.

“‘I told them, you ask me to do

. anything with these machines here,
and I’ll do it,” Newberry said
recently, “but when you tell me not
to help a living thing, well, there
are just some things you have to do
in your heart, even if you know the
consequences." ’ . _

In one of its most unusual
grievances ever against Lockheed-
California 00., the International
Association of Machinists has taken
up 'Newberry’s case, trying to
restore her job or at least an
honorable retirement that ‘would
restore her pension and health
beneﬁts. .

"In my opinion, it was a chicken
thing to do,” union spokesman Bob
Guarino. said. "I don’t like cats

‘myself, but I adore the lady.
Everyone is upset”; ,

Some Lockheed officials also
expressed dismay at
firing. - ‘

"It’s a most unfortunate situa—
tion,” company spokesman Richard
Stadler said. “She was counseled

about it. as long as four years ago

~and disobeyed- She was a good
worker. It’s just that she loves cats.

Cats have always roamed the
plant, and until recently they were
welcome because they. kept the
rodent population down. But in the
last year, the feline population has
gotten out of hand. . -

"We aren’t talkmg about. a

about cats in the triple figures,’
Stadler said. “And these aren t

workers say they have occasionally

employees tolerate the cats. But

Newberry explained why she'

feeding the cats despite the show-
downs with Lockheed and encoun-
ters with disgruntled neighbors,
who, she said, over the years have
threatened her, bashed in her car
and killed some feline adoptees she
took home. . . . _ '
Newberry grew up on an Iowa
farm and went to California in 1942
when the Army transferred her
husband. They were divorced a few
years later, and she bought a house
in Burbank, where she began

feeding wild birds and stray cats.

She never really owned any of

the cats, Newberry said. '

“They just sort of moved in on

me,” she explained.

 

Newberry moved from her ﬁrst

‘ neighbors complained to city offi-

cials, who in turn told her she could
have only four cats.
So she rented out her house and

”bought another. She also bought

neighborhood to feed the cats she

Newberry said she likes the

that used to be reserved for their
human masters.

The emergence of veterinary
specialists during the past decade
has revolutionized pet care by '
giving pet owners an array of new
options —- from organ transplants
to pacemaker implants — to
consider when their animals get .
siCk.

But because these sophisticated
procedures are so costly and so few
animals are covered by medical
insurance, the most critical
decision pet owners face often isn’t
how to treat their pets but whether
to treat them.

To cure or not to cure -— that
increasingly is the question.

Ms. Dickey, a high school
teacher, didn’t waver for a moment.
She already has spent more than
$4,900 on Pasha, and she hasn’t
established a limit on how much
more she’s willing to go. “If I had to
borrow money, I would do it,” she
says.

All pet owners aren’t as willing
as Ms. Dickey. “We can do a hell of a
lot more than people will pay for,”
says Dr. Alton F. Hopkins, a Dallas
veterinarian who is completing his
term as national president of the
American Veterinary Medical
Association. “That’s very .
frustrating -— to have an animal
that you know you can save and a
family that . . . can’t afford to.”

It’s a dilemma that long has
arisen whenever a pet is ill. But re-
cently, the stakes have been raised
to hundreds and, in some cases, .
thousands of dollars.

“A lot of times in veterinary
medicine, things come down to an
economic decision,” says Dr. Cheryl
'K. Harris, a Dallas internist and on-
cologist. “There are always going to
be people who just can’t afford it.
And for others, a pet is just an ani-
mal.”

This attitude is changing as pets
become more important parts of to-
day’s smaller families, says Dr. Ger?
ald J. Rubin, a Dallas internist and
cardiologist who has worked as a
general practitioner and veterinary
college professor.

“People need family substitutes,”
he says. “There are more older peo-
ple today, and they treat animals
with the same respect they might
give to a member of the family.

Young people, too, have more
money to spare for animals.”

Today, according to an AVMA
survey commissioned in 1983, pets
are found in more than half of the
households in the United States.

The survey found 56 million dogs
and 52 million cats kept as pets.

Caring for these animals is big
business. Last year, dog owners
alone spent more than $120 million
on veterinary visits and prescrip-
tion drugs, according to Pet Sup-
plies Marketing, the bible of the pet
industry. A 1983 survey by the
AVMA estimated the average an-
nual veterinary bill for all pets to
be $88.55. By now, AVMA officials
say, it’s almost certainly more than
$100 a year.

Although most of this money is

' spent on relatively routine proce-
_ dures such as vaccinating and

dewqrging animals. veterinarianc

f,long have been capable of handling ;

ifar more complicated tasks. But be-

‘ icause the market for, say, cataract

ésurgery and chemotherapy was so
illimited, most of these specialists re-

mained shrouded behind the ivy-
Escovered walls of academia.

. About 15 years ago, veterinary
specialists began straying beyond
campuses and into private practice.
Among the first in Dallas was Dr.
,Lloyd M. Reedy, who sold his pri-
vate practice here, went back to
school and returned in the mid-70$
as the area’s lone veterinary derma-
i tologist.
g “Lots of folks wagged their heads
'1 and said it wouldn’t work,” Hopkins
recalls with a chuckle. “But it did
work.” .

Specialists such as Reedy faced
doubters in two directions. On one
hand, they had to convince general
practitioners that they weren’t
trying to steal their customers. (Ac.
tually, this is an ongoing concern
that many specialists address by ac-
cepting clients only on a referral
basis.) On the other hand, they had
to convince pet owners that they
performed legitimate services.

. To most people, including many
pet owners, radiation therapy for

V cats or open-heart surgery for birds

seems either funny or futuristic.

-»

The aspect of veterinary special- ' '

ization that strikes people as most
unlikely is probably its similarity to
human medicine, as Carolyn Ma-
caulay discovered when she took
her dog to a local internist to treat a
liver ailment.

She remembers looking at the
plaques listing the other specialists
in the building and shaking her
head. “I couldn’t understand why
he shared space with (human) doc-
tors,” she recalls.

. The building Mrs. MaCaulay vis-
ited actually houses two veterinary
internists, one who doubles as an

; oncologist and thébther as a car-
; diologist, a radiologist, ‘a dermatolo-
= gist, an ophthalmologist and a sur-
_ geon. Elsewhere in Dallas, you can
find veterinarians specializing in
I neurology, dentistry and acupunc-
g ture. ‘
9 . The new breed of veterinary spe-
' c1alists can’t perform miracles. But
3 they nevertheless have dozens of

satisfied customers eager to spread
the gospel.

. . Consider, for instance, the expe-
rience of Glenda Wood, who re-
turned home from an extended
: busrness trip earlier this year to ‘
find a knot on the'face of her 11-
year-old mixed-breed dog, Kim.
‘, _ Her general practitioner at first

-‘ ~o~ .s. L. ..

suggested she wait to see if the con- . ‘
dition would improve on its own.
Bat aiter two weeks, the situation
seemed serious enough to warrant
' exploratory surgery. The operation
' revealed a particularly virulent
form of sinus cancer.
5 Because he wasn’t able to surgi-
; cally remove all of the cancerous
5 bone and tissue, Ms. Wood’s general
practitioner referred her to Dr.
Catherine Lustgarten for radiation

therapy. “He told me that if my dog

1'?

i had to have cancer, I was in the
_. right place,” she says. ’

g Faced with no other viable alter-
i, native besides euthanasia, Ms.
Wood authorized a series of 12 radi-
ation treatments. The results were

i as favorable as could be expected:
The cancer went into remission,

i and the therapy desensitized the

“ disease-ravaged portion of Kim’s
face.

Then the cancer spread from the
left to the right sinus, a develop-
ment that forced Ms. Wood to an-
swer an agonizing question: Had the
time to say goodbye to Kim finally
arrived?

Her initial reaction was that it
had. But after further considera-
tion, Ms. Wood opted to resume ra-
diation therapy and continue the
treatment as long as Kim responded
4.. favorably and showed no signs of
pain.

“I don’t have one grain of doubt
' or remorse. Not one,” she says. “I’m
‘ buying time. Without the radiation
, treatments, Kim would have been
3 dead by the‘end of March.”
If Ms. Wood’s experience has
been bittersweet, Mrs. Macaulay’s
‘ has been almost entirely positive.
Her 9-year-old Doberman, Stas-
cha, had been acting oddly — eat-
ing poorly and urinating exces-
sively -— when she took the dog to a
- general practitioner last fall.

wszs’f'iamawv . .. «. a». \

l

 




Initial tests were inconclusive, '

: and Stascha didn’t respond to medi-

' cation. By the time internist Rubin

‘ uncovered a liver ailment and rec-

’ ommended exploratory surgery,
Mrs. Macaulay was toying with the
possibility of putting Stascha to
sleep.

“I thought if the dog was going to
die anyway, I didn’t want to put her
through surgery," she says. “I
waited a week to make the decision.
Then I just decided that if I went
ahead and chose the surgery, at
least I would have tried.”

Although the operation per-
formed by Dr. F. Foster Vernon con-
firmed that Stascha’s liver was rid-

‘dled with disease, it enabled Rubin
to prescribe medication and a spe-
cial diet that have given the dog a
new lease on life. .

“At the time I brought her in,
they gave her six months (to live)
unless we could reverse the trend. I
think it was less than that,” Mrs.
Macaulay says as Stascha frolics
around her living room. “Now, it’s
like I have a young dog.”

. With medical knowledge in-
creasing exponentially, veterinari-
ans must resist the temptation to

itreat disease simply because it’s pos- '

that pets ought to be treated, to a

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your support for H.R. 1516, the
Tongass Timber Reform Act of 1987.

I certainly share your interest in ensuring that our unique
natural habitats are properly protected. Our wilderness areas are
among America's greatest treasures, and we must preserve these lands
and the wildlife that inhabit them for future generations. '

In regards to the problem of timber harvesting in the Tongass
National Forest, Senator Proxmire has introduced a companion bill to
H.R. 1516 in the Senate in order to address the issue of where
lumbering in the Tongass will be permitted and what the level of
subsidy will be. Hearings have been held on this issue in House
committees, and they may be held on the Senate side later this fall.
I look forward to reviewing this legislation at greater length and
will keep your thoughts in mind as we consider it in committee.

Again, thank you for keeping me informed of your concerns.

Animal-Cruelty .
reports soaring

By LINDA HELSER
The Arizona Republic

An increase of almost 50 percent in animal abuse
and neglect complaints received by the Arizona '
Humane Society between June 1986 and June 1987
has at least one ofﬁcial there scratching his head.

“We see just about everything,” said D.E. Adams,
lieutenant in charge of investigations for the past
three years. “It’s just that suddenly, we’re seeing so
much more of everything, especially in the last few
months. The cruelty and abuse complaints have been
unbelievable, particularly the cat cruelty.”

For instance, Adams said, a 4-year-old, playing
alone in his grandmother’s front yard, was learning
the meaning of “taking turns.” One by one he
attempted to drown six newborn kittens in a puddle.

In another part of town, a frustrated 10-year-old
attempted to break the legs of three cats. He was
stopped after fracturing the leg of just one.

And a woman gave a teen-age neighbor one of her
kittens. It was found 45 minutes later, near death,
with burns over 75 percent of its tiny body. The teen
claims no knowledge of how it happened.

Summer is always a prime time for cruelty and
abuse complaints.

“There are a lot of stray litters of kittens around,
kids are out of school and a lot of them are
unsupervised,” Adams said.

But statistics compiled by the Humane Society
show that 1987 is on its way to being a
record-breaking year.

This June, there were 255 complaints; there were
171 in June 1986, and 110 in June 1983.

And Adams can’t explain why.

"I just don’t know,” he said, “and I hate to limit it
to just kids, even though they do most of the torture,
because the majority of complaints are on adults who
provide no shelter or food for their pets or just
abandon them when they move.”

Or they claim to be "training” their pets, as one
west»side Phoenix man did. When investigators
responded to a complaint from neighbors, they
discovered a dog with a broken jaw, his eyes ﬁlled
with blood and bleeding from the mouth. Several
witnesses said the man had repeatedly struck the'dog
with a wooden two-by-four during the alleged
training. ' -

"Animals are chattel in this society,” said Dr.
David Wodrich, a psychologist at Phoenix Children’s
Hospital. “They are seen as property or just objects.”

Consequently, people tend to think they have the
right to treat their animals however they chose.
"And children tend to do what they are allowed to do
or what they’re exposed to,” Wodrich said.

Very young children may torture animals because
they know no better.

“They may have an awareness of something being
alive but no notion of its feelings, because they’re so

ﬂamma'cwelw

 

 

 

 

egocentric,” he explained. "Adults need/to set good
examples.”

As for older children, Wodrich said, the reasons for
cruelty and torture are multiple. Aside from lacking
supervision and good examples, teens’ viewing habits
may be responsible. .

‘ “Look at what they’re seeing in the media, and in
rock videos and the movies,” he said. "It’s mutilation,
maiming and gore with animal and human body

Wodrich, like Adams, does not understand the
sudden increase in cruelty and abuse complaints.‘

Adams is tired of searching for reasons. He wants
it to stop.

"Prosecution is not always the answer,” he said.
“Although we rarely ever lose a case that we pursue,
few charges are filed.

"The charges are a misdemeanor and difficult to
prove, and it takes months to prepare a case. We’re

not peace ofﬁcers here, so we have to work with the
police department, and that can take hours. We don’t
have the manpower for that, with only four
investigators.”

In Arizdna, cruelty to animals is a Class 2
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $750 and/ or
four months in jail. There are a lot of repeat
offenders.

"Sometimes when they’re convicted, their right to
own animals is revoked for six months to year,”
Adams said. “But they go ahead and get animals and
just say they belong to their wife or someone else in
the household. There is no real restitution for an
animal.”

And when Adams and his investigators do remove
an abused or neglected animal from a home, the only
recourse is to take it to the Humane Society’s facility
at 9226 N. 13th Ave.

"We took in 4,000 cats and kittens here last month
alone —- how can we find homes for all those cats,
including the abused and neglected ones we bring in?
We may save them from their owners, but so many
times they end up being put to sleep. So what’s
better?”

A change in laws could help some animals, Adams
reasoned. -

“There is no law in Phoenix that deﬁnes when a
cat becames a stray, like with dogs, and there’s this
general consensus that cats are just free roaming

animals.” ,

"People really get frustrated
with roaming cats, because they
can cause a lot of trouble on their
property,” Adams said. “So they
take things into their own hands.”

The best solution to the upswing
in abuse and cruelty, Adams said,
would be a combination of things:

“First, we need to do a better job
controlling the p0pulation of cats
and dogs with spaying and neuter-
ing, particularly the cats.

“Then we need to make parents
' aware — they shouldn’t always
assume their kids wouldn’t hurt an
animal. And they need to be more
aware of what their kids are
doing.”

Education is the next step.

"Some people honestly don’t
know how to properly care for an
animal,” he said.

“They tell me that they feed

their dog once a week and that,

should be enough.

"If they’re trying to train a dog, '

And never, Adams said, give,

Skunk law called not ‘black and white’

 

By Michelle Hickey
Staff Writer

 

Skunk lovers voiced their oppo-
sition to a new Fulton County ban
on skunks at a public hearing Tues-
day, and both sides agreed the leg-
islation’s wording was not, in the
words of a skunk owner, “black
and white” enough.

“We do have to clear up the
gray areas,” said Michael Lomax,
chairman of the Fulton County
Commission, after the 75-minute.
meeting in which he was offered a
pet skunk and invited to a garden
party where skunks would be in at-
tendance

Lomax, Commissioner Michael
Hightower, representatives of the
county police department’s animal
control unit and the Atlanta Hu-
mane Society met at the county
courthouse with about 30 skunk

owners, many of whom have
formed the “Skunks as Pets”
(SAPS) citizens’ group.

SAPS members oppose a provi-
sion of a revised animal and rabies
control ordinance, which took ef-
fect July 1, that bans the sale or
possession of skunks. They support
the banning of wild skunks, distin-

' guished by their black and white

markings, but not domesticated
Skunks, which have chocolate
brown markings.

“What we wanted to voice to-
night was that we’re not crazy peo-
ple who want wild skunks and ra-
bies,” said Debbie Karnes, an
owner of two skunks who lives in
Buckhead. But the new law bans
all skunks except those owned pri-
or to July 1.

Lomax, noting the “emotional
pleas of people who are obviously
very close to their skunks,” agreed

the definition of a domesticated
skunk needed to be clarified. 'He
said SAPS could make a formal
presentation to the commission at
its Aug. 5 meeting. ' ..

Fulton County Animal Control
Director Robert Fisher, a former
skunk owner, vowed to defend the
ordinance. He claimed that hun-
dreds of baby skunks are sold
yearly in the county, and only a

small percentage survive to adult:

hood because of improper care.
“If they get it repealed, we’ll

live with it,” he said. “But we’ll .

try again later. Let’s face it, these
skunks are producing hundreds of
other skunks, but where are their
owners? Not here, because those
skunks have died. And even though

_ skunks. are been de—odorized, they

still stink. For their own welfare,
let’s keep what we’ve got now, but
let’s not keep anymore.”

PIGEON MOUNTAIN, Ga. -
The folks who feed young Wyoming
golden eagles before releasing
them in the northwest Georgia
mountains this summer don’t want
the birds to think meals are being
served by mom and dad.

 

It would be unfortunate and
possibly fatal if the birds thought
they were winged pe0ple. This
would hamper the eagles’ ability to
become great, efficient predators.
They might spend the rest of their
lives expecting free dinners from
human beings, according to Ted
Touchstone, a wildlife technicianI
with the Georgia Department of
Natural Resources (DNR), who di-I
rects the state’s golden eagle resto
ration program in Crockford-Pi-
geon Mountain Wildlife|
Management Area near LaFayette
in Walker County.

Twelve golden eaglets an aver
age of 7% weeks old were brough
by plane from Wyoming to Georgia‘
for the restoration project in June

Mountain until the age of 11%
weeks, the prime time for their re-
lease. Touchstone began releasin :

They remain in captivity on Pigeor] _

the young eagles in mid-July, an '.
the last birds will be freed in Aul

gust. He hopes the golden eagles
will mate, build nests in North
Georgia and begin re-establishing a
p0pulation over the next few years.

p. Before being released, the gold-
en eagles have been kept in big
cages in towers 22 feet above the
ground. From there, the birds see
pastures and forest from three
sides, but a wooden wall blocks
their view of anyone climbing the
1 laddertandgapproaching with food.

ATLANTA JOURNAL - July 22, 1987

"State tryingto restore eagles to N.

“People feeding the eagles
can’t see them, and birds can’t see
the pe0pie,” Touchstone said. “So,
there’s no association between food
and people. Imprinting” - a pa-
rental bond with a species other

. than their own -- “is a real prob-
“ lem in this kind of operation. Im-

printing would allow a developing
eaglet to associate people as par-
ents of their kind, and they can
grow up thinking they are people
instead of eagles.”

Eagles are born with their eyes
closed, preventing the process of
imprinting from starting at birth.

“There is some debate as to
when imprinting is at its strong-
est,” Touchstone said. “The general
feeling is that with eagles, it is 5 to
7 weeks old. We handle the birds at

a critical time in their lives when

they can be influenced. In these

. formative days, it is a great time

to be exposed to this new geo-
graphic location.”

The ability of eagles to be im-
printed, however, allows this pro-
gram to succeed.

“If they tend to stay here and
develop their flying and hunting
skills, they think of this as home
and return here to nest,” said
Touchstone, who majored in biolo-
gy and animal science at Berry

College. “And then you have recov- ,

cred and re-established that breed-
ing nucleus. That’s the ultimate
goal of the program —- to have
their progeny in Georgia.”

gist Bill Collins, ‘DNR regional

Adult golden eagles have a
wingspan of 7 to 71/: feet and feed
on small mammals such as rabbits,

Since Georgia joined the Ten-

BRIGHTON, N.Y. (UPI) — The

Pet dumping peeves

Carrollton family

The Nicolles have been able to
find homes for most of the am- ;
V '- - mals
they take in. Smokey, a cat found

peeping out of a brown paper bag

on the side of the road, was sent to a
North Dallas family. Susie, a boxer
who strolled up to the, Nicolles’
front door, lives with a veterinar-
ian nearby. Others — including a
collie; a poodle, an Irish setter and a
black retriever — have all found
homes, thanks to the Nicolles.

“Most of the people we place the
pets with are found through word-
of-mouth,” Mrs. Nicolle said.

“Snokey found her home when I
accidentally took her to work with
me. She had jumped in my van. A
doctor decided to take her.”

The Nicolles have contacted ani-
mal health officials in Carrollton
and Denton County, but they refuse
to send the pets there in fear they
will be destroyed. ' ,

“There are really very few op-
tions open to them,” said Crystal

Pixley, who worksfor the Animal

I Control Center in Denton.

up for adoption or humanely de-

The Nicolles are trying to find

homes for a mixed-breed dog they

call Sandy, a cat and two kittens. All
four appeared Saturday morning
near the front entrance of the Ni-
colle ranch.

“This is a throw-away society,”
Mrs. Pixley said. “The dog and-cats
were probably left there (the Ni-

colles’ ranch) because they have a -

lot of land. Apparently, they (own-
ers) didn’t‘want to take care of the
animals anymore.”

TAMPA TRIBUNE - July 11, 1987

0 | ’ 5 death

in of van

prompts investigation

By JIM SLOAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — Five months after an investiga-
tion into allegations of cruelty at Hillsborough
County’s animal pound, prosecutors are looking
into the death of a dog that baked to death last
month inside a sweltering pound truck. ,

The dog was found lying in a pool of blood
after its internal organs exploded from the two
days of heat inside the truck.

The dog’s owners had requested it be picked
up because it had heartworms and other diseas-
es, Animal Control Officer Roy Baugh told sher-
iff’s officials. The dog was picked up June 26.

The 7-year-old Doberman pinscher was taken

. to the animal pound on Orient Road, but was left' ‘

on the truck. Its body was found June 29 when

another officer took the truck out.
Animal rights activist Raini Sequoya,

attorney asked the sheriff’s department to inves-

whose

tigate the death, said temperatures over that
‘weekend reached the mid-905.

“This animal died one of the most horrible
deaths an animal can die,” Seqouya said. “He
literally baked to death in a'tiny compartment,
and his internal organs exploded.”

In a news conference at his home on Davis
Islands Friday, Sequoya called for the immedi-
ate resignations of Animal Control Director Dan
Gorman, his assistant, Lynn Goldie, and “the im-

'mediate supervisors in the chain of command
under them.” ‘

“They have proven again and again that they

' are not capable of operating the animal control
department,” he said. .

Sequoya said he also is considering filing a

$10 million lawsuit against six'of Hillsborough

County’s seven commissioners who he claimed

ignored recommendations for changes at the

county pound made after last year’s cruelty

probe. iny Commissioner Jan Platt would not
be sued, he said.

The county pound is “the Auschwitz of the
animal kingdom,” Sequoya said. .

Sequoya also is recommending that the Coun-
ty Commission censure Public Safety Director
Gil Rodriguez, who oversees the pound.

Rodriquez called Sequoya’s demand for res-
ignations “asinine.”

He said he ordered that the driver of the
truck be disciplined long before Seqouya be-
came aware of the incident. A pre-disciplinary
hearing is scheduled Friday.

“The animal control officer involved has ad-
mitted that he screwed up, he just left the ani-
mal on the truck," Rodriguez said. “It’s unfortu-
nate, but when you handle 28,000 animals a year
out there, something like this can happen.”

Rodriguez backed Gorman and Goldie in the
face of Sequoya’s criticism.

“I happen to believe that Dan Gorman and
Lynn Goldie are doing an outstanding job,” he
said. “They don’t overlook anything. They don’t
hide under a rock, they tell it like it is and take
action.”

Rodriguez said Gorman has made a host of

Last year, Sequoya arranged a news confer-
ence with former animal control officers who i

said they had witnessed cruelty to animals. The
conference led to an investigation and ultimately
to animal cruelty charges against a former offi-
cer and a current officer.

ihree resolutions condemning whaling
for scientific research. This effective-

used by Japan, Iceland and South Ko-

Q Last year, despite the whaling ban,
6,361 whales were taken, according to

commission records. Japan and the

most of the kills. The remainder were
attributed to South Korea, Norway

Japan is the ‘only major market left

By Thanhha Lai ‘
Contributing Reporter --

Some residents of Cape Cod. Nantuck-

But some residents argue the action is?

tha' s Vineyard. "lt 3 bad enough now.’
She and others charge that the real
motivation behind the proposal is .to in-
crease the deer population, which would
ensure game for the hunters. They con-

many signs that the deer popula-

deer herd. and ‘not once did I
think about what the hunters or
anyone else wanted." he said.

The number of deer killed by
motorists on the Cape and Islands
has tripled in the last three years,
and complaints of crops damaged
by deer have increased. he said.

Opponents. armed with 400

vision. suggesting an alternative
population—reduction method.
Their plan would have hunters
kill more does as a way of reduc-
ing reproduction. -

But Lewis Schlotterbeck. the
division's deputy director for ad-
ministratioii, said there are not
enough hunters for the number of
permits available now. Hunters

Hunters also like to shoot
bucks more than does or fawns;
Schlotterbeck said. Of the 5.289
deer killed statewide in 1985,
about 70 percent were bucks. Curd
rently a hunter must have a per-
mit to kill a doe or fawn; the per-t
mit was instituted in 1967 as a
way to increase the statewide deer
population, which was then
6,000. About 40.000 deer roam the
state now. opponents of the rule
change said.

The division will vote on the
proposal at its board meeting at
Lenox town hall next Tuesday.
fSome opponents charged the
board scheduled its meeting in
western Massachusetts to discour’
age attendance by residents of the
Cape and islands.

. . ."We are going to have to ride
the'ferry' into Cape Cod [from Mar-
tha's Vineyard] overnight. and
spend the night there before driv-
ing up to Lenox," Bunting said.
“That is like a five-hour drive. So
we'll have to start at five because
the meeting is at 10:30."

Schlotterbeck said the board
meets regularly at different loca~

tions around the state, and oppo- '

nents already had a chance to pre
sent their views at a June 30 pub-
lic hearing in Buzzards Bay.

.“1 don’t think there is any“
thing we can do to satisfy these ;

people,"

he said. “This is a group

that is psychologically opposed to‘
hunting. They won 't be happy un-- V.
less we get rid of all the hunters."

Man’s best friend, or foe?

Keeping pit bulls as; pets has be

By Laurin Sellers
‘ Orlando Sentinel ' _ 3 3
ORLANDO, Fla. — All five fatal dog attacks
in the United States this year have been
blamed on pit bulls, fueling an emotional de-
bate over whether the breed is an acceptabl
pet or a public menace. 3' , ~
“People have created a monster,” said Susan
Moore, a Brevard County, Fla, woman whose
son was badly scarred in an attack “It’s like
trying to keep a wolf or a lion or a tiger in your

home. Pit bulls don’t belong in neighborhoods.” ~>

_ The controversy has caused some insur-
ance agents to refuse to insure homeowners
“who have pit bulls and prompted a ﬂurry of

attempts to 'ban pit bulls from residential

. areas.

' And it has resulted in a prison sentence for
a Georgia man convicted of involuntary man-
slaughter after his three pit bulls killed a 4-

3 3 year-old boy.

Pit bulls have genetic traits that give them
the potential to be more dangerous than other‘ -.
, breeds, many experts say. For centuries, the -
stocky, muscular pit bulls, which weigh be-
tween 25 and 100 pounds, have been bred to .

' attack other dogs in a fight to the death.

Although there is no'evidence to show that :
pit bulls attack people more often than other '

breeds, their bites are often, the ‘3
most severe, says Marc Paulhus, a
spokesman in the Tallahassee office
of the Humane Society of the United
1 States.
f “Most other dogs bite and re-

4’-
s

, lease, but pit bulls tend to bite and“.
.- hold and shake and tear,” Paulhus
says. “That’s why pit bulls are re--
esponsible for more than their share '
”fol fatalities.” ~ '
3“} Nevertheless, other experts say ;
Ellie breed is getting a bad rap, that“.
1‘ Carefully bred eed‘tre‘i‘ae‘d pit bulls
" rarely pose a threat. 3 .
They believe the problem lies ,
with some dog owners who want a 3
“macho symbol” for a pet and with
irresponsible breeders who want
only to make money. - 3
Because experts believe the pit
bull’s temperament is partly inher-
ited, cautious breeding narrows the
risk of producing vicious pets,
.Paulhus says. Still, pit bulls bred for
’. illegal dog fighting often are sold to
3the public. . .
' And with insurance companies
‘paying costly claims involving at-

i

 

 

come a nationwide debate

tacks by pit bulls, many agents with
major firms are refusing to write -
homeowner’s policies for residents
who own the dogs.

Officials from the home offices
of State Farm and Allstate, two of
the nation’s top providers of home-
owners’ insurance, say their compa-
nies have no national policy exclud-
ing coverage for pit bull owners.

But an Allstate agent in Orlando,
who requested anonymity, says he
and other agents will not write
homeowners’ policies for pit bull
owners.

“To my knowledge, Allstate, in 3

the state of Florida, does not want
to write homeowners’ insurance for

ifanyone who owns a pit bull,” he
isays.

A Brevard County agent with
State Farm says his regional office,
after having to pay two claims
against the same woman for two at-
tacks by the same pit bull, requires
owners of pit bulls and Rottweilers
to sign an exclusion clause before
issuing homeowners’ insurance.
Both supporters and detractors
agree that some pit bulls have been
dangerous, but there is no con-

; sensus about solutions.

In 1985, a Dade County legislator
proposed a bill requiring that pit
bulls be leashed, muzzled, regis-

tered and insured for $1 million. It

died in committee.

A recent pit bull attack on a 9-
year-old girl in Brevard County
prompted county commissioners to

re-evaluate their animal-control or-
; dinance and penalties. Commis-
; sioner Thad Altman, who wants pit
bulls singled out because “they
were 'bred to maim and kill,” is
pushing an ordinance to rid neigh-
borhoods of them.
In Texas, pit bulls have attacked
people in several cities, prompting
3 cons1deration of pit bull regula-
lthIlS. One particularly vicious at-
tack, in March 1986, involved 2-year-
old Shanda Seeberger, who was
. mauled in Wylie by a pit bull terrier
running loose in the neighborhood.
The child, hospitalized with bites to
. her chin, mouth and under her
right eye, remained hospitalized for
more than a week for a fractured
cheekbone.

So far this year, Farmers Branch
has adopted an ordinance that will
“phase out” pit bull terriers within
the city limits. The City Council
voted unanimously Monday not to
allow residents to acquire pit bulls.

In Dallas, where Sue King, 20,
was bitten on the left leg and wrist
by a neighbor’s pit bull terrier June
28, no action has been taken. And,
according to Dr. Jeffrey Pruitt. of
the Animal Shelter Advisory Com-

mittee, the problem with pit bulls is

 

the owners, “nil-W . WW I”

“As of right now, we haven’t dis-
cussed it,” says Pruitt, whose com-
mittee would be the one to study
the issue. “My opinion is that pit
3 bulls are good dogs, and oWners
3 need to be more careful of how to
take care of them.” i'

home before animal-control offi-

cers could arrive, save the puppy
and subdue the pit bull. '

The attack, according to Rich-

“ ardson city secretary Virginia Gru-

ben, has prompted several residents

 

‘Most other dogs bite
and release, but pit bulls
I tend to bite and hold and

shake and tear. ’

— Marc Paulhus,
Humane Society spokesman

 

“torequest action against pit bulls.
“The. City Council has asked the
city staff to research an ordinance,”
Ms. Gruben says. “I don’t know
whether we’re going to ban them.”
'Two days later, in Arlington, a
pit bull chained in front of a house

broke free and attacked a 23-year- *

old TU Electric meter reader, leav-
ing minor bites on his stomach.

“We are looking at revising our
ordiance and the staff is studying
various aspects at this time,’.’ says
Bob Byrd, assistant director of Com-
munity Development/Health in Arl-
ington. “We’re trying to determine
what will be the best approach to
this. Any type of pet or animai prob-
‘lem usually stops ,with responsible
pet ownership, and you can’t regu-
late that. We’re looking at training
for owners — ideally, when it

' comes to a violent animal, it’d' be
nice to have training or posting of a

 

bond of some sort.”

At present, Byrd says, Arling-
ton’s ordinance says a complaint
can be brought against animal and
owner only after the animal has at-
tacked or bitten an animal or

' human. The animal can, after a
hearing, be removed from the com-
munity and, in some cases, de-
stroyed. ' ~‘

“It doesn’t say anything about pit
bulls specifically,” Byrd says.
“We’re looking at what can be con-
sidered a hazardous or vicious ani-
mal before they attack someone.”

Elsewhere, pit bull regulations
are already in place. In Washington
state, for example, owners whose
pets cause severe injuries to a per-
son can be charged with a third-de-

. gree felony. And in Los Angeles, an-
, imal-control officers have the
power to impound any dog that
bites a person and to destroy the an-
imal if it is deemed dangerous.

Some cities are clamping down on

most severe ordinances is in Liberty,
IMo., where all new pit bulls are

who had the dogs before the ordi-

of $50,000 liability insurance, keep
the dog in a pen and post a sign warn-

HumanProgress Through Animal Experiments

Upon reading the June 24 letters,
“How Much Is The Life of An Animal
Worth?” it seems the obvious answer is:
more than that of humans.

We eat chickens, pigs, cows, fish,

, ' lamb, and shrimp. We make pets of

dogs, cats, birds and turtles. What is the
real difference between pets and food?

When scientists want to use these
same animals for experiments to en-
hance and save human lives, people get
up in arms. In his June 15 Commentary,
Dr. Michael DeBakey wonders how par-
ents of sick children “would feel about a
society that legislates the rights of ani-
mals above humans.”

History has shown that humans were
punished severely for beating their
horses but not for keeping and beating
slaves. When the Titanic went down, we
sacrificed men so the women and chil-
dren could be saved. Not one survivor
protested this unfair treatment as
unfair.

‘So we can’t sacrifice the life of a few
animals to save our women and chil-
dren from life-threatening ailments, but
it’s OK to drown human males for the
same purpose?

When-the concern over the welfare of
animals becomes greater than that of
human life, then human life will cease
to exist. I must ask, “How much is a
human life worth?”

R. E. Buerke

St. Louis

The most recent spate of letters by
the anti-vivisectionists, to give them

their proper Victorian-era name, once
again proves that a group with a griev-
ance will not be swayed by mere truth.
The so-called facts these people promul-
gate are worse than misleading: Some
are untruths so blatant they must be
deliberate. A few real facts:

The medical profession and the treat-
ment of patients have been furthered by
animal research. The development of
the Salk polio vaccine, the break-
throughs in bypass surgery, transplant
surgery and the treatments for heart
disease and cancer have all been devel-
oped through the use of animal models.

. ’ No computer model can reliably dem-

onstrate the use of such treatments in a
living being.

The National Institutes of Health and
the Animal Welfare Act have very strict

. guidelines that must be adhered to. Re-

search institutions are policed, and
these regulations are enforced. Scien-
tists are not sadistic monsters; they have
genuine concern for the welfare of the
animals they use. No responsible scien-
tist has any desire to cause unnecessary
pain or suffering to any animal.

But in plain hard language, no accept-
able alternative exists to animal re-
search. This is not a function of cost but
a function of reality. The research must

be done; people are dying of a variety of -

diseases that can, with greater knowl-

. edge, perhaps be cured. Whenever pos-

sible, research is done with mice and
rats, but sometimes larger animals are
necessary. .

As for the supposed “humane” death
that abandoned pets are given at the
pound, I can only suppose that these
people have never seen an animal put to

- death at a pound. There animals are not

sedated; they areput into a decompres-
sion chamber and decompressed to
death. It is an unpleasant and painful
death. The pending legislation to disal-
low the use of pound animals for re-
search is foolish and wasteful; it is less
kind than the death by sedation that is
the frequent end for large laboratory
animals. But I know that where the anti-
vivisectionists are concerned, such logic
falls on deaf ears. Nothing is sadder
than the sound of one mind closing.

ST. LOUIS POST- DI SPATCH

Reputatlon Sending
Pit Bulls To Pound

‘ By Kim Bell
Of the Post—Dispatch Staff

, Nationwide publicity about vicious

pit bulls attacking humans is leading -

some owners here to abandon the
dogs at shelters, pet stores to drop the
breed and kennels to refuse to keep
them.

The St. Louis County Animal Con-
trol Shelter reports that three pit bull
owners surrendered their dogs to the
shelter on June 24 -— the day after a
television newscast showed a pit bull
attacking a woman in Los Angeles.

“The owners had no idea the ani-
mals could be that aggressive, ” said
Dan Knox, St. Louis County
veterinarian.

Only one of the dogs had a history
of aggressiveness. All three were de-
stroyed, Knox said. The shelter has 3

~ policy not to offer a pit bull or any
cross breed of the dog for adoption.

In the past two weeks, the Missouri
Humane Society has been ﬂooded
with telephone calls from owners of
pit bulls who had seen the newscast

“They were asking ‘WPQEdQI have -

. here? What have I gotten into?’ ” said
{Rose Soehngen, chief clerk at the
"Missouri Humane Society. “They
.don’t want to be responsible in case
their dog turns on someone.” 4

' For Lula Albright of Maplewood,
that newscast was the final straw in
deciding the future for her pit. bull.
On Thursday, she left the dog at the
shelter.

“I heard some were bad, and I
didn’t want to take any chances,” Al-
bright said. “It was a playful little
puppy. But with tiny children in this
neighborhood, it could run after them

- and get too rough.”

These owners are waking up to
what many animal experts have said
for years: Pit bulls seem to have an
instinct to fight, and no one knows
when that instinct will surface.

Most area kennels contacted by the
Post-Dispatch have policies against
housing pit bulls. Those who do house
the breed say they take special
precautions.

The Der Meister K- 9 Farm at 8700

Weldon Avenue, Normandy; refuses
to house most pit bulls becauee the
dogs “tear through the kennels wir-
' ing trying to get to the other dogs”

One kennel will house a pit bull Only
if empty cages are on each side of the

imal.

anPeople interested in pit bulls know
that the dog will not be found in pet
Shir; Neuhauser, owner of A- 1 Pet
Stop at 2182 First Capitol Drive in St.

 

Charles, said: “It’s impossible to car-
ivry them because they’ re too aggres-
isive. Even when they’ re puppies, pit
{bulls will be cruel to the other

é' pilppies.”

- Mick" Tosh, manager of the Ches-

’ "terfield-.Mall Pass Pets, said stories

that pit bulls are being used as attack
dogs had made carrying them “bad
business.”
_ “We don’t carry them because of
the reputation,” he said. “If the dog
gets out and chews up Somebody, we
don’t want anyone knowing it came
from Pass Pets.”
4‘hat policy to stay away from the
breed is company-wide at Pass Pets.
Linda Neville, who buys dogs for
Pass Pets stores, said she. turned

down all offers from pit bull breeders __
because, “Why promote something

bad?”

- an aversion to them, ” said employee
Ed Conrady.
“I, personally, like pit bulls —— they

just got a bad rap,” said Conrady. He -

is from Cincinnati, where such dogs
are outlawed because “they chewed
up some kids.”

The bad reputation of pit bulls does
appear to be well-founded.

In June, a 2-year-old boy in north-
ern California died after being
mauled by a pit bull alleged to have
“been used to guard marijuana plants.

In 1986, seven of the 12 dog-caused
fatalities in the United States in-
volved pit bulls. So far this year,
three fatalities have involved pit
bulls.

Several incidents have occurred in
the St. Louis area: A

I In February, a pit bull bit a 9-

y‘ear-old St. Charles boy. The boy re-
quired treatment at a hospital emer-
gency room.
' I In December 1986, a_pit bull
attacked a jogger in Belleville and
tried to pull the man into a nearby
field. The man was bitten at least sev-
en times and required stitches.

I In May 1985, a 2-year-old boy
was mauled by a pit bull and under-
went surgery for a head injury.

Pit bulls, also known as American
Staffordshire terriers, inflict a great-
er wound when they attack people

than do other breeds, according to a

recent study
Most dogs bite and hold their vic-

‘tirns, but pit bulls bite and tear and

tissue, the study said.
Animal specialists in Boston found

that pit bulls were being bought main-
: ly by people who want to tap into
- their aggressive nature. Not every-

one, though, agrees that pit bulls are
born to be mean. ‘

Ivan Hudson, 19, of St. Louis, owns
10 pit bulls He praises the breed for
its “ability to support its owner.”

“My two adult pit bulls would kill a.
person if I ordered them to — just on
a one-word command,” Hudson said.
“If someone breaks into the house,

. the dogs are going to do justice to that

, person.”

Hudson said his dogs had never

' been asked to “perform.”

Ronald Brown, who lives near Fes-
tus, owns eight pit' bulls. He said,
“The worst you’d have to worry about
is being licked to death.”

Brown is trying to sell some of his
dogs, but he finds they cannot bring
in top-dollar prices anymore. The an-
imal can go for as little as $60 whole-
sale —— and breeders say that’s “dirt
cheap.”

dogs, when a pit bull has a victim in its jaws it
will violently shake its head, causing rips and

tears, rather than just hold its prey in its grip.

Pit bulls also can be bred to ﬁght to the kill,

rather than quit when its opponent has

surrendered. In one publicized case, a child
under attack tried to play dead, but the dog
continued attacking, twice biting through, the
victim’s spine.

In defense of the breed, Karin Maida of
Manassas, Va., who helped train President
Reagan’s dog, Lucky, said that in her experi-
ence American pit bull terriers have not been
aggressive toward people. ‘

Although pit bull terriers were "bred to bite
and not let go, and they give no warning,” their
behiavior depends more on their masters, she
sa1 .

Over the past several weeks there have been
many reports of pit bulls attacking, maiming

and killing pe0ple, mostly children. In many
cases owners have said ‘the attacks were
accidental, but in a growing number of
instances the dogs have been sicked on victims
with only the slightest provocation.

Police in major cities report that ghetto
youths often keep pit bulls as status symbols. In
a recent Washington case, a 16—year-old boy '
sicked his dog onto an 11-year-old just because
tllie younger boy had discovered the dog’s hiding
p ace.

In a recent Los Angeles case, an animal
control ofﬁcer was attacked by a pit bull as she .
arrived at a house to investigate the do ’8
earlier attack on a child. The dog had to e
beaten off the, woman ofﬁcer by a television
crew that was covering the stary.

Part of the problem in dealing with pit bulls
is the difﬁculty in drafting an effective law
against them. , . _

In Chicago, the City Council is considering
forcing pit bull owners to license and tattoo the
dogs on the upper lip and require owners to
carry up to $100,000 in public liability

- 4 insurance.

The ordinance’s sponsor, Alderman Law- .
rence Bloom, said a key problem is that
"current laws fail to deﬁne the term ‘vicious
animal.’ ” '

In some states, however, the courts have
taken decisive action. ‘

Last November three pit bulls in Decatur,
Ga., mauled a 4-year-old boy to death. The 1
owner of those dogs was sentenced to ﬁve years
in prison for involuntary manslaughter. The
dogs were put to death.

Ofﬁcials in most states, however, including
Georgia, said it w0uld be difﬁcult to pass laws -
speciﬁcally against pit bulls. They said it would
be almost impossible to outlaw any speciﬁc
breed, especially since the degree of viciousness
of the dog depends largely on how it is trained.

gijJETROIT —- Pit bulldogs
x-brought into some Humane Socie-
ties by their owners face quick

gagrowing number of people who
§§iwant to get rid of their dogs for
“' '-g1iability or legal reasons.

"If a pit bull is brought in by its

While the national Humane

“Whenever there has been a.

‘Lockwood said. “It’s a case of wives

reported similar increases in the 1

numbers of pit bulldogs being
turned over to shelters.
On June 13, a 2%-year-old boy

i was fatally mauled in Sanga Clara ‘

County, Calif, by a 50-pound pit
bulldog guarding his master’s
backyard marijuana patch. Last
year, a youth was killed in Michi- .
gan’s Upper Peninsula. and there
have been reports of attacks by pit

bulldogs on adults and children .

nationwide. ~ .
Lockwood said 36 states have
legislation regulating the owner-

ship of vicious animals. In the -

Michigan Legislature, pending
bills would regulate pit bulldogs
speciﬁcally and dangerous animals
in general. '

Earlier this month, the Hartford
City Council approved an ordi-
nance banning ownership of pit
bulldogs after three children were
bitten by the same dog within a

. two-month period.

Valerie Grimes, executive direc-
tor of the Humane Society of
Southwestern Michigan in Berrien
County, said some pit bulldog

owners have surrendered their

dogs because they couldn’t afford
liability insurance for the animal. '

Al Kuiper, director of the
county’s Animal Control Center,
said dogs brought to his shelter
would be killed immediately, in
part because of his own concern
about liability.

Some people are keeping the .
, dogs mainly for intimidation or for

fighting, Lockwood said. He added
that the nature of the dogﬁghts
have changed over the years. ,
“People who are involved in dog -‘
fighting are often involved in
illegal weapons, drugs and other
crimes,” he said. "We are getting
more calls from law enforcement
ofﬁcials who are ﬁnding that
rather than being faced with a

a pit bull.” . -

SOUTHERN MAGAZINE - July 1987

 

 

 

We heard it through the grapevine .

Don-o. ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo

WILY COYOTES

Beasts of the West are heading South

-m—~:

In Southern states, the coyote is not an endangered species.

 

t was December 1985.

and Frank Lashlee, a state

senator from the small
town of Camden in west Ten-
nessee, was enjoying a quiet
dinner at home. As he sliced
into his meal, something led
him to look up. There, stand-
ing on his patio and gazing at
him through the glass, was
a large, gray, dog-like animal
with a sharp snout. Only it

 

wasn’t a dog. It was, unmis-
takably, a coyote.

A few days later, while driv-
ing to Nashville for a meeting
of the state legislature, Lashlee
looked over to the side of the
road and spotted another one
of the animals calmly trotting
along the edge of the inter-
state. That was enough. Some
farmers he knew had been
complaining to him about

 

coyote attacks on cattle and
insisting that the traditionally
western predator had moved
east. He hadn’t believed them
before, but now he did. ‘ "We
have got an epidemic.” Lash-
lee announced to a reporter
a short time later. “There’s
just a tremendous number of
them, and they’re not afraid
of people anymore. ”

Of course, Westerners
might have told Lashlee that
it’s been a long, long time
since coyotes were afraid of
people. Once dubbed the “sur-
vivor” by American Indians,
the coyote has inﬁltrated most
of the major cities of the West
Coast; in Los Angeles, resi-
dents have been known to
keep their cats on leashes in
their backyards to prevent
them from becoming coyote
snacks. But it is only in re-
cent years that the coyote has
moved east. In Mississippi.
state biologist Bobby Wilson
recalls seeing his first wild
coyote in 1976; he can’t count
the number he’s seen since
then. Five years ago, he says,
Mississippi coyote fur dealers
sold 2,000 pelts. Last year,
29,000 pelts hit the market.
‘ ‘We've probably got 300,000
of the animals here now,”
he says.

Biologists say coyotes are
range animals that thrive on
the farmland that has replaced
forested areas across the South.
Already established in Arkan-
sas, Louisiana, Mississippi.
Tennessee, and Alabama, coy—
otes are now said to be estab-
lishing a foothold in the more
eastern states of Georgia and
the Carolinas. The immigrants
have not, however, been ac-
cepted with open arms by
farmers, who charge that the
coyotes are thriving on their
sheep, cows, and horses; some

 

farmers in Tennessee have
complained that they have
lost as much as 25 percent
of their young calves to the
newly arrived predators.
Though environmentalists
have argued that coyotes are
not a major threat to farmers,
state legislatures have begun
listening to the farmers‘ com-
plaints. In March, Tennessee’s
Lashlee pushed a bill calling
for a bounty on coyotes. One
version would have autho-
rized the state to pay $ 1 5 to
anyone turning in a coyote
pelt as proof of a kill. Others
thought that the entire car-
cass should be required.
Tennessee farmers have
pushed for‘liberalized killing
seasons, and in some states.
farmers can ldll or trap coyotes
on their property year round.
But bounties, used in Western
states years ago to control
coyotes, have been used only
on a limited basis in the South.
and the verdict is still out on
the best way to control the
coyote population. Wildlife
officials argue bounties would
have little if any long-term
effect. They claim coyotes
reproduce faster if their
numbers are reduced, mean-
ing bounties could possibly
result in a coyote population
explosion. It may be that the
South, like the West, will
simply have to learn how to
live with the animals. That.
contends Ed Warr, a wildlife
biologist with the Tennessee
Wildlife Resources Agency.
may not be all bad. Their
threat to other animals and
humans is at best exagger-
ated, he insists. ”You always
end up with a few bad ones
that give all the others a bad
name,” he says. “There’s not
going to be any terror in the
streets."—-Bruce Dobie

 

 




 

 

SCIENCE

 

Born Free—Home Free

 

 

With antibiotics, ﬁsh milkshakes and a
slippery sling, an aquarium saves the whales

 

his is a New England whaling tale,

though it’s not exactly a classic. There

is no mad captain, no Ishmael, and the
whales are neither great nor white. Its
protagonists are three sleek, black pilot
whales, a diminutive species that doesn’t
grow much longer than 20 feet or weigh
more than a ton, give or take a couple of
hundred pounds.

Don’t call them Moby or Humphrey or
Monstro—not even Shamu. These whales
had no dog tags when they arrived. Last
winter they turned up among dozens of
pilot whales that began beaching them-
selves along the Cape Cod shore. Townspeo—
ple along the cape tried to save the whales
from slow and certain death, pushing
them back to Sea. But no one could
stop the suicidal landings—a mystery to
scientists—and most of the whales, about
60 of them, died.

Three young males, however, were res-
cued. The New England Aquarium gath-
ered up the dying calves from the sand,
loaded them into a van and rushed them
back to its Animal Care Center in Boston.
The whales were suffering from circula-
tory problems and tissue damage, from
elevated hormone levels and suppressed
immune levels. Not surprisingly, they
were in a state of shock.

For six months the aquarium staff
nursed them on a diet of antibiotics, vita-
mins, ﬁsh milkshakes, squid, mackerel and

herring. The whales put on weight fast. The '

biggest gained 300 pounds to top out at
about 1,100 pounds, larger than three Re-
frigerator Perrys. The monthly weigh-in
required 12 people, a forklift and, as one
researcher put it, “a lot of good will on the
part of both parties.”

The plan was to return the whales to the
sea, but because pilot whales aren’t an
endangered species, it was hard to justify
$50,000 for a rescue mission. So the New
England Aquarium scientists classiﬁed
the project as research into aquatic mam-
mals. Each whale would carry a radio
tag—one would bear a satellite transmit-
ter as well—to permit the research team
to stay in contact. The aquarium staff
would try not to get too attached to the
mammals. The ﬁrst two were called Tag
and Notch because of markings on their
ﬁns, and the, third was named Small,
though some took to calling the little
570-pounder Baby.

As far as anyone at the aquarium knew,
whales had never been rescued, rehabili-
tated and returned to the sea. But pilots are
known to be very social. The people at the
aquarium thought that if they could just
ﬁnd the right foster parents out there in
the Atlantic, the grown whales might
adopt the tiny threesome. “Our greatest
hope was that a pod of whales would swim
over, surround them, and they’d all swim
off into the sunset,” said aquarium boss
John Prescott, who may have seen a few too
many Disney movies.

Yankee Freedom: So on a sunny summer
Sunday, the aquarium team hoisted the
trio out of their 60,000—gallon pool, loaded
them into crates and deposited them on the
deck of the Albatross IV, a research vessel
donated for the expedition by the US. gov-
ernment. A surveillance plane led the
search; a party of journalists and well-
wishers tagged along aboard the Yankee
Freedom. By morning the Albatross was 55
miles southeast of Nantucket Island—and
in whale heaven. There were humpbacks
and ﬁnbacks exploding from below and
ﬂipping in graceful dives, and there were
pilot whales cavorting along the surface.
"Thar she blows,” yelled Yankee Freedom
skipper Tom Hill. “And thar. And thar.”

 

The Albatross picked out one of the
“thars” and closed in. The idea was to
lower the whales into a pen ﬂoating in the
water and to release them once they got
their sea ﬁns back. But as the sling carry-
ing Notch descended, it almost careened
into the ship. Notch hit the water thrash-
ing, burst through the cage mesh, shed his
transmitter and headed for glory.

The mishap put a damper on the adven-
ture. But as the Albatross wallowed on in
search of a good spot to -release the re-
maining pair, a solitary pilot was spied off
the stern of the Yankee Freedom. Notch,
perhaps recognizing the sounds of the Al-
batross, had circled back and was tagging
along, waiting patiently for his friends. A
short while later, Tag and Baby dropped
over the stern of the Albatross into the
sea. Within seconds Notch was abreast of
them. The three began diving and surfac-
ing in perfect synchronization, nuzzling
and, for a while, frolicking with friendly
dolphins. '

The Albatross tracked the whales for '
three days. Because of heavy fog, nobody
could be sure that they had joined a pod.
But born free, they were back where they
belonged.

Dear Mr. Kuhl:

It is difficult to believe such a thing would be allowed to happen .
in a civilized country where our people are supposedly educated.

I realize far too many have absolutely no compassion at all when

it comes to the suffering of animals, Suffering inflicted by un-
caring humans, but the story from.Animals" Agenda of April 1987,
(copy enclosed) is really sickening and never should have been
allowed to happen.

I am not a vegetarian, but this story alone has cut back about 95%
on.my consumption of beef, and it will continue to do so until I
know something is being done to see that such a tragedy does not
occur again. Employees who knew about the suffering of this cow
should be fired immediately - they have no business being anywhere
near a living creature. I wouldn't even trust them around humans.

Of course, I am fu11y convinced the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture should
have checked this situation in Milwaukee, and I am urging my Con-
gressmen to see that the USDA is empowered to do so in the future.
But your oWn organization should certainly see that random checks
of slaughterhouses and stockyards are made unannounced on a regular
basis, prompt euthanasia of downed animals, regular milking of cows
'with_full udders, and permission given to animal rights people to
feed and water animals in the stockyards. And isn't it ironic of
we compassionate humans -'we take from the milk cow as much as pos-
sible over a period of years, and their reward is being sent to the
slaughterhouse.

we owe these animals who provide us with food, humane treatment at
all times

Thank you.

Sincerely,

ANIMAL' 5 AGENDA
. April 1987

Murder in the
Stockyards

The following is an account of conditions at
a Milwaukee slaughterhouse as observed by
area resident Linda Rinelli. Prior to her dis-
covery of the downed cow mentioned in the
article, Rinelli observed cows with full adders
and injuries being held in close quarters with-
out food, water, or bedding. Quite likely, the
conditions at this abattoir are typical, and
represent only the tip of the iceberg of animal
suffering caused by the meat industry.

The cow lay motionless at first. As 1 ap-
proached, she raised her neck and head,
and with clear, alert eyes attempted to
communicate her distress. I was startled
to see the animal lying there on the
cement. I’ll never forget her eyes. I’ve
worked on a dairy farm, and I know that
cows are sensitive creatures.

The place was the Peck slaughterhouse
in the Milwaukee industrial valley. I had
volunteered to go to Peck after hearing
that animal abuses were taking place, but

I never expected to see such hideous and
inhumane treatment. I reported the event
to County Humane Officer Bill Forss,
who investigated the complaint, but even-
tually closed the case for lack of substan-
tial evidence. ”The slaughterhouse main-
tains that the animal was dead at 7:00
am. that morning," said Forss. ”It's your
word against theirs."

Then it must have been a miracle, like
Lazarus, since after I had first sighted the
animal at 7:00 am. she was there alive
and suffering for a period of almost an
houn

I eventually made a citizen's complaint

to City Attorney Nancy Maloney, only to ’

have her concur with the humane officer.
”There is just not enough evidence for the
prosecution," stated Maloney, who cau~
tioned me on the legal hazards of
trespassing.

The attention of local animal rights ac-
tivists was first directed towards the
slaughterhouse when a construction
worker on the 16th Street Bridge anony-
mously reported seeing horrendous treat-
ment of stock below him. At that time the
slaughterhouse and stockyards held
"downed" cows (injured or disabled ani-

mals) somewhere near the bridge and
transported them to the slaughterhouse
grounds west of the bridge. Because of
numerous complaints by the public, they
are now warehousing their downed ani-
mals in a more isolated area.

"The constuction worker reported that
downed cows were being tossed around
like inanimate objects," explains Carol
Simon, State Director of the Humane
Farming Association. Simon and her as-
sociates have been attempting to investi-
gate animal abuse at the slaughterhouse

 

U

since that report and have made at least
three attempts at determining if food or

water is available to the animals there.

On each attempt, we have been chased
of f the premises,” says Simon. During one

ll

attempted visit, Margaret Gebhard, an
area teacher and member of Citizens

United for Animals, was told by a main-

unless they have first been rendered un—

Since this incident I have spent time
at Peck and walked around Milwaukee
stockyards. Besides the event I witnessed
at Peck, I have seen animals bruised and
bleeding from unloading, and dairy cows
with painfully full udders. One mainten-
ance man at the stockyards told me these
dairy cows sometimes are in transport
two or three days with full udders. I have
never seen food or water available to the
animals in any of the holding pens.

Simon and Gebhard also agree that
they have never seen food or water
available; yet adequate food and availabil-
ity of water is written into state and
federal livestock laws. ”If they would only
let us in to assure ourselves the laws were
being met, it would be a good start. What
are they hiding?" queries Simon.

The Humane Society of the United
States (HSUS) reports that ”each year
millions of farm animals pass through
stockyards en route to feedlots and
slaughterhouses, and there animals often

are subjected to brutal treatment by un-
qualified, uncaring livestock workers. Yet,
while such handling leads to injury and
death, these creatures are afforded little
to no protection by law."

According to Wisconsin state law, coun-
ty humane officers like Bill Forss are

authorized with police powers to inspect '

companies like Peck if suspicion of animal
handling violations exists. However,
another humane officer recently told
Gebhard (off the record) that humane of-
ficers could be subject to harassment

 

charges if they make surprise visits too

often. Who, then, can enforce the laws
that protect slaughterhouse and stockyard
animals?

The HSUS recommends enactment of
new laws which could close current loop—
holes in laws and thereby protect animals
during all facets of their lives.

The Humane Farming Association
would like to begin working toward that
goal. ”A law is in order for random check-
ing of slaughterhouses and stockyards
unannounced four times a year," states
Ms. Simon. ”This is just to begin with.
Downed cows should be slaughtered im-
mediately on the spot, and dairy cows
should not be held with full udders for
an extended period of time." In England,
animal activists are allowed to feed and
water livestock. "Why can’t we?” asks
Simon.

LaRenda Odom, Secretary of the HSUS
Department of Investigations, has
another point: ”We feel that one of the
solutions to transportation and auction ,
cruelties is consumer education. When

the public and meat industry officials
become aware of the circumstances in
which most ’food’ animals are marketed
and transported, they will demand that
conditions be improved.”

But the present public demand is for
meat products, not for humane animal
handhng.

CAN A CHIMP TRANSPLANT SAVE HUMAN LIFE?
BY NICK TAYLOR

OSEPH RIZZO HAS PRAYED
for an accident to kill a
healthy young person of his
size and blood type so that
Rizzo might have the heart.
The 60-year-old Long Island
jeweler is dying, and he and
his family are desperate. He
has spent a year on the heart-
transplant list at the Columbia- Pres-
byterian Medical Center in Manhat—
tan. But time is running out, and the
day may soon come when the heart
surgeons approach Rizzo with a rad-
ical proposition: Would he consider

raises. But upward of $1 million has
already gone into preparatory re-
search, one review committee has
given its approval, and the National
Institutes of Health has agreed to
back the program with a $3.36-mil-
lion grant. It seems likely that final
approval will be given and that such
an operation will take place before
the end of 1987.

When it does, the hospital and
university expect a storm of protest,
publicity, and controversy. When
“Baby Fae” was given a baboon
heart at an obscure hospital in Loma
Linda, California, animal-rights ad-
vocates marched with STOP THE

 

chimpanzee?

“I don’t want it,” the heavy, balding
Rizzo said, gasping for breath as he sat in
the center’s Vanderbilt Clinic waiting for
a checkup. He was thinking about the
question for the ﬁrst time. “I don’t want
any chimpanzee. I’d rather expire. If I
can’t get the real thing now, let me go.”

His companions in the room—four
men, a woman, and a bubbly infant in a
stroller—looked on from behind their
pastel-colored surgical masks, worn to
ward off infection. They had already re-
ceived new hearts. Their vitality spoke
volumes about the success of transplants
in cheating heart disease, the leading

cause of death in the United States. But
there is not enough of “the real thing,” as
Rizzo put it, to go around.

And so the transplant surgeons at Co-
lumbia~Presbyterian are prepared to im-
plant the heart of a chimpanzee into a
human chest, Rizzo’s or another’s. The
heart would be placed beside a failing
human heart and, the doctors hope, serve
as a “bridge” to sustain life until a hu-
man donbr can be found.

The university and hospital are still
pondering the dizzying array of issues—
questions of animal rights and patient
consent, for example—that the plan

to animals.

Then there are questions that even the
surgeons on the transplant team have not
satisfactorily resolved. A chimpanzee
will be the donor because it is man’s clos-
est relative. Humans and chimpanzees
share 99 percent of genetic materi-
al, including blood and tissue groups and
certain immune-system characteristics.

worked for extended periods in human
recipients. But chimpanzees are an en-
dangered species, as well as beloved
creatures. For precisely these reasons,
one quails at the thought of using them.
Craig Smith, one of the surgeons who
will perform the Operation, says, “I’m
wondering whether we won’t find it hard-
er than we think.”

Columbia-Presbyterian is embarking
on this slippery slope because of an inex-
orable numbers game. This year the car-
diac-transplantation unit, headed by sur-
geon Eric Rose, has been putting healthy
human hearts—“harvested” from victims
of fatal head injuries—in patients at the
rate of more than one a week, up from 36
in all Of 1986. Heart transplants are up,
but so is the number of people who need
them. The American Council on Trans-
plantation says 1,368 heart transplants
were performed last year in the United
States. A study by the Battellelnstitute of
Seattle, Washington, suggests as many as
15,000 could have beneﬁted from the op-
eration. The shortage Of hearts has left
people like loseph Rizzo wanting. Al-
though, at Presbyterian Hospital this year,
the ratio has improved, with ﬁve wait-
ing-list deaths and 34 transplants
through late lune, nearly a third of the
patients who need transplants die before
a heart is found. “The risk of waiting for
the operation exceeds the risk of having
it,” says Keith Reemtsma, Columbia-
Presbyterian’s chief of surgery.

If the chimpanzee heart can reduce
that risk, Reemtsma believes it will signal
an extension of what he calls “the golden
age Of surgery” that began with Open-
heart surgery and transplants. He can see
a vindication of his life’s work, and antic-
ipates the day when chimpanzees or other
primates may be bred to make up for the
shortage of human donors. But even he is
not sure whether he is standing at the
edge of a “frontier or an abyss.”

EEMTSMA MAY NOT BE
known outside the medical
world, but within Colum-
bia’s College of Physicians
and Surgeons he is said to fit
the mold for “Hawkeye”

Pierce, the wisecracking Korean War
field surgeon in M*A*S*H. Author and
retired surgeon Richard Homberger had
himself in mind when he crafted Hawk-
eye, but Reemtsma shares some of his
characteristics. He arrived in Korea in
1952, fresh from the University of Penn-
sylvania and Columbia medical schools,
with a footlocker full of scotch. He
served in Inchon and Pusan and in the
surgery tents of the First Marine Divi-
sion. The sound of evacuation helicop-
ters returning from the front remains with
him.

“When those helicopters came in, in

 

the opening scene, I thought, ‘My God,
that’s me right there,’ ” he says. “The op-
erating-room scenes, the football game
in Tokyo, I was there. When I saw that
movie, I thought it was a documentary of
my life.” Reemtsma says that, like Hawk-
eye, he also mixes a good martini.

Among the pioneers of transplanta-
tion, names like Barnard, Shumway, and
DeBakey come to mind, but not Reem-
tsma. He is, however, an authentic trail-
blazer whose chimpanzee-tO-human kid-
ney transplants at Tulane in 1963 remain
a benchmark of cross-species transplan-
tation. '

“I picked a window in history when it
was ethically acceptable to do this,” he

 

N 1966, REEMTSMA MOVED FROM
Tulane to head the University of
Utah School of Medicine’s depart-
ment of surgery. There, he began
the artiﬁcial-heart program that led
to a more publicized experiment,
the implantation of the Iarvik-7 artificial
heart in retired dentist Barney Clark in
December 1982. Clark’s death helped
convince Reemtsma that primate hearts
are potentially better replacements in
humans than the mechanical variety.

By that time, Reemtsma had left Salt
Lake City and returned to New York and
Columbia, where he had received his sur-
gical training, to head the department of
surgery. Here, at the medical center, on

says. “NO one had had any success in
[human] cadaveric grafts, and nobody
had dialysis. The patients, if they didn’t
have a brother or sister to donate a kid-
ney, had nothing.”

Reemtsma transplanted chimpanzee
kidneys into six humans in 1963 and
1964. The longest-surviving patient lived
nine months. She died not Of kidney fail-
ure but of infection, which may have
been a side effect of crude anti-rejection
therapy.

Chronic dialysis and the success of
kidney transplants from human accident
victims ended Reemtsma’s experiments
in 1965. But that early success supported

his belief that Organs of one species can

support life in another for long periods.

168th Street, Reemtsma began building
an organ-transplantation program. He
added chronic dialysis, began a program
of research in immunology, and then
started transplanting kidneys. In 1977,
Reemtsma led the team of surgeons that
performed Columbia-Presbyterian’s ﬁrst
heart transplant.

By 1981, the operation was becoming ‘
relatively frequent, if not routine. Eight
of the country’s 62 heart transplants were
performed at Presbyterian. In 1983, the
selective anti-rejection drug cyclosporine
was apprOved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration. Cyclosporine brought an
end to the “shotgun” treatment of rejec-
tion—massive doses of steroids—which
weakened the recipient’s immune sys-

tem, making him prey to opportunistic
infections, much the way AIDS does. The
number of transplants has risen nearly
tenfold since then. The operation was
performed at 91 hospitals in 1986, up
from 37 in 1984, and is now often covered
by Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

All along, Reemtsma was convinced
that the next step was to place a chim-
panzee heart in a human. The people he
hired would come to believe it, too.

RIC ROSE WAS JUST 31 WHEN

Reemtsma appointed him to

head Columbia-Presbyterian’s

heart-transplant service in

1982. Craig Smith was 33 and a

sixth-year resident in surgery.
Rose did not have transplantation in
mind when he started working with
Reemtsma. But, as he puts it, “Keith is a
visionary individual.” Reemtsma sent
Rose off to the famous Stanford trans-
plant program and told him to “be a
sponge” and return to make Columbia-
Presbyterian a leader in heart transplan-
tation.

Smith, however, began performing a
growing share of the hospital’s heart
transplants. Starting with 9 in 1983, he
performed 29 of the hospital’s 36 in 1986,
and 19 in the first five months of 1987,
but he no longer keeps count. “I don’t
know, 70, 80, 90,” he says. “It was sur-

prising how quickly I lost track. It kind of -

gets under your skin and takes on a life of
its own.”

Both Smith and Rose now share
Reemtsma’s vision. “The quintessential
problem in heart transplantation for the
future is donors. You’ve got to think be-
yond human donors,” says Rose.

For a surgeon, the lure of heart trans-
plantation is partly its pure excitement.
The timing is as unpredictable as the vio-
lent tragedies—mostly trafﬁc accidents
and gunshot wounds—that provide the
donors. Rose compares it to being a
fireman.

Eighty percent of the low-risk patients
who have received hearts at Columbia-
Presbyterian have survived four years or
longer. Even a majority (about 60 per-
cent) of high-risk patients—people with
diabetes or an ulcer, or whose lungs have
been weakened by prolonged heart dis-
ease—live for a year or more after a heart
transplant. “These are people who would
otherwise be dead within a year,” says
Rose.

The best way to lose a patient, then, is
never to enter the operating room. The

46 NEW YORK/JULY 13, 1987

 

New York Regional Transplant Program
maintains ties with emergency rooms
and trauma centers in metropolitan New
York. The aim is to increase organ and
tissue donations, now required by state
law to be sought from a donor’s family.
But nearly half the families, many
simply distraught and others ignorant of
the need, turn down the requests. Faye
Davis,’the Regional Transplant Pro-
gram’s executive director, wants to raise
the donation rate to 80 percent, the na-
tional average.

But, she says, “no matter what we do,
there won’t ever be enough.”

Rose and his colleagues considered
mechanical hearts. Robert Iarvik, inven-
tor of the Iarvik-7, made a sales call to
Rose’s office. By then the larvik heart had

proved a mixed blessing. Though it kept .

patients alive—William I. Schroeder,
who followed Clark, lived for twenty
months—it caused increased clotting
and strokes. Its external machinery was
cumbersome and wheezy—like a massive
vacuum cleaner tethered to a patient.
Rose saw the Iarvik as a “bridge,” but
nothing more.

“Our view is that it’s a bridge to no-
where,” says Rose. “If there are no more
donors at the end of the rainbow, a
bridge becomes irrelevant.” The primate
heart seemed to offer possibilities both as
a bridge and, if the problem of rejection
could be overcome, a permanent re-
placement.

ERIOUS GROUNDWORK BEGAN

in the fall of 1984. Reemtsma

knew that a chimpanzee’s kid-

neys would work for months in

a human. But there was no

guarantee that what had
worked with kidneys would work with
the heart. Only three primate-to-human
heart transplants had ever been done;
one patient lived for three and a half
days, but the others died within hours.
All were done before the advent of
cyclosporine.

Rejection occurs in every transplant.
The body’s white blood cells sense the
presence of a foreign organ and attack it,
destroying the new organ’s muscle cells.
The ability of cyclosporine to tamp down
that reaction without compromising the
entire immune system has made human-
to-human transplants viable. Crossing
species barriers makes the reaction more
severe. The wider the gap from one Spe-
cies to another, the more dangerous the
reaction.

 

The Columbia-Presbyterian surgeons
wanted to test a variety of modern im-
mune-suppression drugs on animals
closely related to man. They decided to
transplant the hearts of cynomolgus
monkeys into baboons. The evolutionary
leap between the two is roughly the same
as from chimpanzee to man. The doctors
reasoned that the drugs that would help a
baboon accept a monkey’s heart might
also help a human accept a chimpan-

‘zee’s. .

The series of primate transplants was
barely under way when, on October 26,
1984, Bailey, at Loma Linda, replaced a
dying baby’s heart with the walnut-Size
heart of a ten-week-old baboon. When
the news broke on that Sunday, Rose’s
wife brought him a copy of the New York
Times and said, “Somebody beat you
to it.”

“Baby Fae” lived for just three weeks,
but that didn’t discourage doctors at C0-
lumbia-Presbyterian. For one thing, the
baboon’s blood type did not match the
infant’s, and matching blood types are
common in successful transplantations.

Robert Michler, then a 27-year-old
third-year surgical resident, did many of
the early primate operations. He trans-
planted a monkey heart the size of a lime
into a pocket under a muscle in a ba-
boon’s neck. The heart was tied into the
baboon’s bloodstream, but it would not
have to do the work of keeping the larger
animal alive. It could be seen and felt un-
der the skin, and so could be checked
without additional surgery, and the even-
tual “death” of this heart would not harm
the baboon. Later, the surgeons would
transplant monkey hearts into the “work-
ing” position in baboons in place of
their own hearts.

In a series of six control transplants
with no immune suppression, the hearts
lived for about a week.

Michler, tall and soft-spoken, kept de-
tailed notes on lined, three-holed paper
in a series of blue plastic ring binders.
He wrote in a succinct, leftward-leaning
script as he recorded the results of the
operations and his daily checks on the
animals.

On January 28, 1985, Michler implant-
ed a monkey’s heart into the right side of
the neck of baboon No. 408/14. The ani-
mal received doses of cyclosporine and
Depo-Medrol, a steroid, in an anti-rejec-
tion regimen much like that given human
transplant recipients. Michler wrote,
“Recipient operation performed smooth-
ly. No postop bleeding.”

 




 

The next day, he noted that the animal

was “very active and alert.”

Nine days after the operation—“POD
9,” in Michler’s shorthand—he observed
“good, strong visible pulsations of the
heart.”

On POD 30, February 27, Michler let
his feelings show: “Hurray! 1 mos. and a
very strong palpable and visibly beating
heart.” He also observed that 408/14
“seems to be getting more friendly.” The
baboon showed “no infection” and was
“eating well.”

On POD 60, March 29: “Palpable
heart. Animal looks well.”

On POD 80, April 18, bad neWs greet-
ed Michler. He wrote, “Very difﬁcult to
feel heart.” He performed an electrocar-

diogram, and found the heart to be beat-

ing weakly. The next
day, it had stopped.
“Heart not palpable,”
he wrote.

But the surgeons
now had reason to be-
lieve that drugs used 7
to ﬁght rejection in
human-heart trans-
plants would work in
cross-species trans- ”5
plants. The results g
were borne out in ten
other baboons.

Those were heady
days in the detached
and objective world of
science. Michler
would exchange
knowing glances with
Rose and Reemtsma
when they encoun-
tered one another in
the hospital corridors.
“I would smile, and
they would smile,” he
says. “I can remember

TEAMWORK: Columbia-Presbyterian’s Keith Reemtsma

was tough to know that she was a control
and she was scheduled to die.”

In a human patient, rejection would be
treated. In the baboon experiments,
where the emphasis was on the initial im-
mune suppression, it was not. On the
morning Michler found the baboon list-
less, with no interest in eating or drink-
ing, he recognized the signs of rejection
and injected an instantly fatal potassium
solution to end its life.

The disappointing results of the work-
ing-heart transplants nonetheless left
Rose determined to move ahead. “We
haven’t gotthe magic bullet here for xen-
otransplantation,” he says, using the
medical argot for a cross-species-trans-
plant. “But thank God all medical re-

such areas as AIDS and hepatitis makes
primatologists reluctant to see them used
as heart donors.

Ian Moor-Iankowski, director of the
Laboratory for Experimental Medicine
and Surgery in Primates, in Orange
County, says it costs about $30,000 to
raise a chimp to two years of age at his
facility. He says he could not give up
chimps as heart donors without some na-
tional policy favoring such use. But
LEMSIP (the laboratory’s acronym) al-
ready has agreed to provide ABO blood-
group typing of the donor chimps, so
they may be matched to human recipi-
ents. It also could provide a place to
house the animals until they are needed
at Columbia-Presbyterian.

HE CHAIN

of events

leading to

the opera-

tion will

begin with

a patient for whom a
human heart cannot
be found and who is
out of options. Rose
7 describes the likely pa-

tient as one “who is
on all the medica-

- tions that we have to
‘ offer, probably on an
intra-aortic balloon
pump, and who shows
continued deteriora-
tion despite all this.”
Long before the pa-
tient reaches a critical
stage, he will have
consented to the op-

. eration. Reemtsma
wants to be sure the
patient, as well as his
family, “understands

 

feeling excitement.”
Later results proved less heartening.
When the monkeys’ hearts were placed
in the working position, survival periods
in the control group, without immune
suppression, actually increased. The ﬁrst
baboon given a working monkey heart
lived sixteen days. “We thought this was
incredible, the answer of the century,”
says Craig Smith. “But it’s turned out not
to be.” Only four of the eleven immune-
suppressed baboons outlived the con-
trols. One, however, lived for 50 days.
All along, the researchers fought
against becoming too involved with the
baboons. They purposely declined to
name the animals. Smith, recalling how
they were rooting for the ﬁrst baboon
with the working monkey heart, says,
“We all got very attached to that animal.

ing her. That monkey got so attached to

as hunches in interpreting the data.
Sometimes those hunches turn out to be

Importing endangered species is against
the law, so they must be bred at a handful
of primate-research facilities around the
country, such as the Southwest Founda-
tion for Biomedical'Research in San An-

duces about 100 baby chimps a year. The

That is one reason the patient is not
likely to be a baby or a young child. The
other is the potential for suffering.
“There can be one of three outcomes to a
heart procedure,” says Rose. “One is you
do great. Two is that you die early, with a
limited amount of suffering. The third,
and the worst, is to live for months with
constant complications and die a difﬁ-
cult death. Inﬂicting that on a newborn,
or a child, I find very difficult.”

Although no patient has been ap-
proached, Rose anticipates that sOme pa-
tients, like Joseph Rizzo, will greet the
idea with reluctance, and some will turn
the operation down. “We have no plans
for twisting their arms,” he says. But he
points out that patients were reluctant to
receive human hearts before the opera-
tion became more or less routine.

inject the recipient with cyclosporine
and steroids so the immune-suppressive
drugs will be in his bloodstream and
ready to go to work when the new heart
is implanted. As surgery begins, donor
and recipient operations must be closely
coordinated.

URGEONS WILL REMOVE THE
chimpanzee’s heart in a labora-
tory operating room. The ani-
mal will be anesthetized. The
chest will be opened and the
heart out free and stopped with
a cold high-potassium solution poured
into a catheter inserted injhe aorta. The
heart will be immersed and kept cool,
about 40 degrees Fahrenheit, in a saline

solution on its trip to the operating room. .‘

Three surgeons,.two profusionists (to
run the heart-lung machine), two anes-
thesiologists, two scrub nurses, and a
physician’s assistant will be waiting. The
patient’s chest should be open, split prac-
tically from neck to navel to the accom-
paniment of rock music. Rose likes rock
to open and close—“It speeds people up.
You need it”—but prefers classical for
the precision work of grafting the heart
in place. Wisecracks ﬂy back and forth
during a normal heart-transplant proce-
dure, typical of doctors who dare to hold
life in their hands, but Rose suspects the
chimp heart will be implanted with a se-
riousness beﬁtting scientists who aren’t
sure what will happen next.

The operation will differ from the rou-
tine in one other major respect. The re-
cipient’s heart will not be removed. In-
stead, the new‘heart will be nestled to its
right and connected, aorta to aorta, pul-
monary artery to pulmonary artery, with
polypropylene monoﬁlament, which is
like ﬁshing line. The two hearts would be
indistinguishable if one were not dis-
eased, but the chimpanzee heart will be
the redder and more vital of the two.

The chimp heart may start beating on
its own. If not, the paddles of an electric
deﬁbrillator will be placed against the
heart to shock it into life. A beating heart
will signal that the worst case—hypera-
cute rejection, in which the heart simply
does not start—has not occurred. Once it
starts, Rose expects the new heart to take
over from the old; both hearts will beat,
but the chimp heart will assume the bur-
den of pumping blood through the recip-
ient’s body.

At that point—some ﬁve hours after it
began, if all goes well—the chest will be
closed and the surgery, the battle, will be

over. But the war to control the body’s
effort to reject the heart will have only
just started. That war, Rose says, could
produce discoveries in immunology
“that go far beyond the individual trans-
plant.”

EEMTSMA’S GREATEST "FEAR
. is that sensational news cov-
erage and the outcry of ani-
mal-rights advocates will
jeopardize the program.

7 “Jesus Christ, taking hearts
out of apes and putting them in little
children or something. I mean, you
couldn’t ask for anything more lurid than
that. This is the National Enquirer, front-
page stuff,” he says.

But the questions raised by chimpan-
zee-to-human transplants go beyond
screaming headlines and the one-note
cries of anti-vivisectionists, who believe
all animal research should be banned.
Cruelty is not the issue, for the donor
chimps will be dispatched far more hu-
manely than animals that are the subjects
of ongoing drug, cosmetics, and psycho-
logical-distress tests. Michael W. Fox, the
scientiﬁc director of the Humane Society
of the United States, calls it a question of
the “sanctity of being.”

“To sacriﬁce an endangered species to
save an endangered individual is a wrong
relationship with the whole of creation,”
says Fox. “This attitude of [human] supe-
riority is laying waste the animal
world.” .

Murry J. Cohen is a New York psychia-
trist who serves on the board of the Medi-
cal Research Modernization Committee,
an offshoot of Friends of Animals, which
reviews animal experiments on an ad hoc
basis. “It is not axiomatic that it’s worth
killing a baboon to save a child,” he
says. “We’re not talking about a parame-
cium. A baboon and gorillas and chim-
panzees and orangutans are very close to
us. They’re biological cousins, and there
is an argument against using them.”

Bonnie Steinbock, a self-described ani-
mal-rights moderate who teaches philos-
ophy at the State University of New York
at Albany, ﬁnds “chilling” the prospect
of raising baboons or chimps to be
harvested.

Arthur L. Caplan, director of the Cen-
ter for Biomedical Ethics at the Universi-
ty of Minnesota, predicts a “storm of
controversy” if that day comes, and fore-
sees' animal farms heavily fortified
against raids ~by animal-rights militants.

Indeed, on November 5, 1985, four

 

members of the Human/Animal Libera-
tion Front, a now-defunct campus organ-
izationat Columbia, went to the animal-
research laboratories at the medical
center and began taking pictures before
they were evicted. “Security up there
now is pretty damn tight,” says Rose.
David Rothman is one expert in medi-
cal ethics who believes that “we have the
moral right to rescue humans by the use
of nonhuman hearts.” Rothman heads
the medical college’s Center for the
Study of Society and Medicine. He meets
with the heart-transplant team on ethical
issues. Rothman’s opinion is important,
since he is also a member of Colum-
bia-Presbyterian’s Institutional Review
Board, which will act this month on
Rose’s protocols. He has served on a sub-

ing the operations for scientiﬁc reasons.

N MID-JULY, THE IRB WILL DECIDE IF

the experiment is sound in princi-

ple. Columbia’s Institutional Ani-.

mal Care and Use Committee must

approve plans for care of the chim-

panzees and reconcile their status
as an endangered species. Hospital
president Thomas Q. Morris and medi-
cal-school dean Henrik Bendixen will
take up legal and administrative ques-
tions.

Finally, the twelve-member IRB will
consider such questions as how consent
will be obtained, how the experiments '
will be monitored, and how the decision
will be made to proceed with the opera-
tion. “What happens,” board chairman
Norman Kahn asks, “if they put in a
chimpanzee heart and four days later a
human heart becomes available? At this
point, they have a bridge arrangement
that is not a study of long-term survival
with a chimpanzee heart.”

Reemtsma, meanwhile, ponders the
dilemma he has helped create. Tall and
stooped, bespectacled and white-haired
at 61, he slumps on a sofa in his bright,
fourteenth-floor ofﬁce with its view
across Manhattan and its statuette of
two brass-faced chimpanzees on the
shelves beside his desk. “It’s a real
question. Should you use a higher non-
human primate to save a human life?” he
asks.

“When you look to the future and
wonder if a hundred years from now peo-
ple will be going down to the emergency
room and harvesting organs to put into
other people, I think it at least deserves a
look.” -

 




THIS IS ONE
CANDIDATE WHO’S
NOT AFRAID TO
ADMIT HE’S A DOG

At the moment, there are 140 hope-
fuls duly registered with the Federal
Election Commission as candidates
,for President of the United States. Of

1 these, only one—Punch Burger of
Chapel Hill, N.C.——truly has a leg up on
the 1988 race. Bristling with animal
magnetism, Burger avoids rhetoric,
makes no campaign promises and
doesn’t seek a cent from fund raisers.
“Besides, he’s no Gary Hart,” says his
campaign manager, Laura Van Sant.
“He was neutered at six months.”

Many candidates turn out to be
dogs, but Burger is probably the first
to be born that way. The 8—year-old is
half German shepherd and half kees—
hond, and his campaign is intended as
an arf-hearted protest against the
usual quality of office seekers. Bur—
ger’s leash, as it were, went into the
ring after his owner, Van Sant, a 20-
year—old journalism and political sci-
ence major at the University of North
Carolina, discovered how easy it was
to register with the FEC. She submit-
ted a declaration of candidacy and an
organizational statement, and her dog
was licensed to run. Later the FEC
was surprised, though not scandal—
ized, to discover the candidate’s spe—
cies. “We don’t ask questions about
candidates unless they raise or spend
more than $5,000,” says FEC spokes—
man Fred Eiland, who adds that ac—
cording to his records, Burger hasn’t
raised enough money to buy a pack—
age of Kibbles ’n Bits.

Still, he is a candidate who can’t be
ignored. He'may be the only candidate
with an identifiable platform—“fewer
import restrictions on beef,” says Van
Sant. On top of that, Burger may pick
up some crucial endorsements. “Offi-
cially the Humane Society can’t sup-
port Punch in his bid for the Presiden-
cy,” says Kathy Bauch, the organiza-
tion’s Washington, D.C. spokeswoman.
.“But unofficially, a lot of fingers are
being crossed." El

 

Punch maintains good relations‘with the
press. “He’s only barked once at a cam-
eraman,” says his campaign manager.

Sacrificing forest for the trees? Takeover artist H urwitz

 

Giant Redwoods

 

A Houston investor takes on a national treasure

 

n the world of investors, Charles Hur-

witz stands tall: through a series of

takeovers, the Houston businessman
has amassed a vast oil, real-estate and
ﬁnancial empire. But lately Hurwitz has
run into an even mightier foe—the Califor-
nia redwood tree. Two years ago Hurwitz
staged a successful raid on San Francisco-
based Paciﬁc Lumber Co., owner of most of
the remaining ancient redwood forests out-
side parkland. Now Hurwitz, who faces
shareholder lawsuits and a government in-
quiry into the takeover, is busily chopping
down the redwoods to pay off massive
debts. Most of all, the reclusive Hurwitz is
learning what it means to take on not just a
company but a state symbol, a national

treasure, the environmental movement,

and a vanishing way of life.

The trouble began when Hurwitz
launched his bid for Paciﬁc Lumber in the
fall of 1985. The company ﬁt the proﬁle of
the standard Hurwitz target: measured by
the price of the ﬁrm’s shares in the stock
market, its redwoods and other assets were
undervalued and could be purchased for a
relative bargain. Drexel Burnham Lam-
bert Inc. lined up junk-bond ﬁnancing, and
Hurwitz’s Maxxam Group Inc., the former
Simplicity Pattern Co., bought the compa-
ny for about $900 million. But aside from
its assets, the family-run Paciﬁc Lumber
had a long tradition of paternalism in the
small northern California town of Scotia,
located near its forests. Employees accus-
tomed to the rhythms of a company town—
and beneﬁts like free college tuition for
their children—feared that under Hurwitz
the old ways would go by the boards.

38 NEWSWEEKzJULYG, 1987

 

Hurwitz promised to maintain most
things as they were but soon suspended
employees’ annual cost-of-living increases.
Then he began attacking the company’s
birthright: thousands of acres of so-called
old-growth redwoods. Among the last rem-
nants of . primeval forests that existed be-
fore the ice age, the 500- to 2,000—year-old
trees yield some of the most expensive
wood on ‘the'market. Hurwitz doubled the
rate at which the trees were harvested—
to a pace of 1 million board feet a day—-
and then started clear-cutting the trees

instead of leaving many stand-
ing to preserve the tall forest.
The company maintains that
the stepped-up harvest. is neces-
sary to boost cash ﬂow: in 1989,
payments on the junkbondswill
leap from $39 million to $83 mil-
lion a year. It’s a risky strategy,
however; John E. Maack J r.,
an analyst with Warburg Rowe
& Pitman Akroyd Inc., says
Hurwitz may end up "ﬂooding
the market” with redwood, low-
ering prices and worsening
the company’s plight. Environ—
mentalists, meanwhile, are
outraged. There have been dem-
onstrations against the compa-
ny, and one group, the Environ-
mental Protection Information
Center (EPIC), ﬁled suit to halt
some of the clear-cutting on the
ground that it has caused mud slides that
have clogged rivers and killed ﬁsh. As a
result, Paciﬁc Lumber agreed to stop cut—
ting on some of its parcels and now the
California Senate majority leader, Barry
Keene, has introduced legislation that
would limit the rate at which companies
can harvest timber statewide. “The New
York junk-bond market needs to realize
that the California redwoods are going to
stay,” Keene says.

Violator or victim? The company could be in
for other jolts as well. Suits ﬁled by Paciﬁc
Lumber shareholders have contended that
Hurwitz and Drexel Burnham may have
put together a secret group to buy the com-
pany’s shares in violation of securities
laws. Last January it was disclosed that
federal authorities were looking into the
takeover as part of the sweeping investiga-
tion involving Drexel and former arbitrag-
eur Ivan Boesky. Hurwitz declined to be
interviewed by NEWSWEEK, but his attor-
ney has maintained that he was a victim of
the insider-trading scheme hatched by
Boesky and former Drexel investment
banker Dennis Levine. Hurwitz apparent- ‘
1y claims that the resulting run-up in Pacif-
ic Lumber’s stock forced him to raise the
price he eventually offered for Paciﬁc Lum-
ber by several dollars a share.

Unless the government investigation im-
plicates him, Hurwitz’s biggest problem
will be meeting Paciﬁc Lumber’s debt pay-
ments. To help out, the company has sold
its $30 million corporate headquarters and
put a $250 million cutting-and-welding op-
eration on the auction block. The stepped~
up production has meant higher overtime
pay for many workers, but they worry that
Hurwitz’s problems may ﬁnally force him
to sell the company’s timberlands. His
aides insist he won’t. But for now, Hurwitz
remains the man who couldn’t foresee a
forest of trouble for the trees.

The West Berlin Zoo has more birds, mammals, and reptiles than
any other 200 in the world, 4,550 of them. The Bronx Zoo, in
New York, has 3,800 such animals, more than any other zoo in
the United States, as well as the brand—new, $9. Simillion indoor
Jungle World, with a forty’foot—high waterfall and steaming rain
forest. The National Zoo, in Washington, DC, is the only 200
in America that has a permanent exhibition of pandas. Cincinv
nati has an insectorium that is incomparable.

Wonderful as all these superlative zoos are, the greatest zoo of
them all is, well, two zoos. One is the '100’acre San Diego Zoo, in
downtown Balboa Park, with more than 3 million visitors a year,
3,200 animals of 800 species, a staff of 800, and an annual budget
of $48 million. The other is a part of the ﬁrst, but thirty miles
north of Balboa Park: the 1,800’acre Wild Animal Park, with
2,300 more animals and an annual attendance of just over 1.5
million. Contributing to the San Diego Zoo’s supremacy are its
7,000 species of plants, some 1,500 of which are endangered.
Then, too, there’s the fact‘that San Diego’s climate and average
temperature of 69 degrees are better for plants and animals than
those of most cities.

A 200, however, is a matter not of numbers but of beauty. Dur—

Oaks Museum, in Washington, DC. , a
scholarly institution owned and run by
Harvard University, offers a case in point.
It is a superb collection, whose quality and
craftsmanship are not those of a rude pro—
vincialsilversmith. The works are compa’
table to Byzantine silver of the highest
standards. Thieves stole the treasure from
the monastery of Saint Nicholas of Myra
(he of Christmas fame) around the ﬁrst
millennium A.D. They bent a number of
large silver trays in half, putting other valv
uables into the folds, and ran off with the
loot. For some reason, they buried a good
deal of it nearby.

In the early 19605, a Turkish shepherd—
ess, sauntering by with her herd, noticed
her animals tripping over a shiny object in
the earth. Digging around, she found
another. Eventually, her fellow villagers
joined in the search, dug up what they
could, and sold all of their ﬁnds tq dealers.
The police, getting wind of events, raided
the village and conﬁscated the few pieces
not spirited away to dealers. George Zacos,
a Greek national living in Turkey and an
international antiquities dealer of great
notoriety, bought up the collection piece
by piece on the black market and smuggled

it out of the country. The scandal was so
great that he left Turkey, settling ﬁrst in
Athens, then in Switzerland, to continue
his activities. (Zacos, now dead, was a
major ﬁgure in the smuggling ﬁeld, and it
is said that Klejman was a protégé of his.
Zacos was instrumental in illegally taking a
unique group of lifeasize Roman bronze
statues out? of Turkey, and his name
appears in COnnection with one batch of
the Lydian: Hoard sale.) _

The Byzantine relics eventually ended
up at the Dumbarton Oaks Museum.
Because it is a scholarly institution, and
because Harvard is involved in archaeo’
logical research all around the world, the
museum was inclined to compromise when
Turkey demanded that the treasure be
returned. Under its director at the time,
Giles Constable, Dumbarton Oaks in
1979 drafted an agreement with the Turks
to share the treasure and to hand back a
goodly number of objects, at the same time

working with them to restore some of the
more damaged items. The agreement went
back and forth, between both sides, until a
ﬁnal draft was agreed upon.

However, the agreement was never car’
ried out, though the two sides have, in
recent months, resumed talks. There is
some dispute as to whether Turkey or Har—
vard reneged over the details, but it is clear
the Turks were not happy that the museum
had wobbled over ceding legal title to the
collection. Nevertheless, the agreement is
there as a model. It points the way for the
future, establishing a principle whereby
countries of origin can keep, and other
countries can see. Ancient sites are better
preserved, and lives saved, once the need
for 'black’market smuggling is obviated.

The other route is a rough one—years of
embarrassing legal skirmishes, outright litv
igation, mutual suspicion, embargoes on
excavation, and an end to the exchange of
great exhibitions. Of course, the Met and
other museums that still harbor illicitly
acquired goods already know that. Cerv
tainly, they must also know that, for their
own interests and those of the public they
serve, the only logical route is the one of
honesty, openness, and cooperation. El

elands. But a visit to a good zoo reac—
quaints us with the curious, gawky royalty
of giraffes and the ponderous humanity of
the large primates. Even if you restrict your
inspection of the San Diego menagerie to
snakes, lizards, and frogs——the eyelash via
per and green tree python, the Fijian
banded iguana, the bearded dragon, and
the poison—arrow frog, which furnishes
South American Indians with the poison
they use on their dart tips—you will ﬁnd
that the works of Faberge and Cartier will
never again seem so wondrous.

The best way to see the San Diego Zoo
for the ﬁrst time is on a forty-minute,
three’mile guided bus trip. G0 at dusk,
when the animals are active, the wildﬂow’
ers fragrant, and the visibility still good.
Next time, you may strike out on foot and
visit the most popular exhibits at the zoo:
its koalas; its gorillas; the nursery where
baby animals are kept in diapers; and the
reptile house, where you can see the New Guinea tree monitor
lizard, a six’footrlong creature that is so rare that it is seldom seen
in the wild (or in other zoos), and such killer snakes as the rhinoc—
eros viper and death adder.

Out at the Wild Animal Park, on a ﬁfty’minute expedition by
monorail, you cannot fail to notice that the people are caged and
the animals aren’t—-—a happy contrast to the old days, when young
and old alike were depressed by 2005’ cramped, cruel cages. Here,
gorillas and gnus, ostriches, Cheetahs, and what appears to be the
rest of the alphabet of creation, from addax to zebra, roam freely,
separated from one another by concealed moat lines and cement
barriers.

In both zoos, you can arrange private, behindrthe’scenes tours,
including photo safaris, which will make you think you are a char!
acter in Ernest Hemingway’s The Snows of Kilimanjaro. At $50 to
$75 a person, though, these safaris are considerably less costly
than a trip to Kenya. When you photograph a rhino from up
close, it is easy to see why more than a pair of them are called a
“crash” of rhinos.

Despite its profusion of four—legged creatures, many competing
zoos believe that San Diego’s most important animal is a beautiful
bipedal Homo sapiens named Joan Embery, who has appeared fre—
quently with the 200’s animals on “The Tonight Show,” “Good
Morning America,” and “Merv Grifﬁn.” In fact, the zoo spends

is home to many endan-
gered animals, including
the world's last two spe-
cies of giant tortoise—this
one from the Galapagos
Islands (above), and an-
other from the island at
Aldabra, in the Indian
Ocean. Both live a century

and weigh 500 pounds.

almost $3.5 million a year, 7 percent of its annual budget, on
advertising and promotion.

This is money well spent, insists Jack Hanna, director of the
zoo in Columbus, Ohio. He recently braved a major snowstorm to
reach New York in time to appear with his animals on “Late Night
with David Letterman.” “A national show gets you some out,
ofvtown visitors, but the chief beneﬁt is the pride it creates in
local citizens about their zoo, ” he says. Such pride is crucial, since
the San Diego Zoo must compete for people’s free time against
beaches, Disneyland, and Sea World, to name only the most
obvious.

For all its international fame, the San Diego Zoo is a local instiv
tution. When an unidentiﬁed woman called to report a sick humv
mingbird in her backyard, the zoo offered to try to save the bird
and turned it over to Ruth Wootten. Scarcely anyone would rec—
ognize this petite ten’year veteran of the bird department as a
member of Teamsters Local 481, which represents twodhirds of
the equal number of men and women who work at the zoo. Woot’
ten usually has a dozen or so sick birds at home to nurse back to
health.

When the woman telephoned again the next day and was told
that the hummingbird was on the mend, she identiﬁed herself as
Joan B. (Mrs. Ray) Kroc, and soon thereafter she gave the zoo

No less riveting than the 200’s animals is
the research it conducts. Animal research
is far more advanced today than it was at
the beginning of this century, when a
horse named Clever Hans became world
famous for his ability to count. (It was
eventually revealed that the horse was
merely responding to the head movements
of his trainer.) Now, for example, the zoo
studies how best to exhibit animals so that
the setting makes each creature’s life and
behavior as natural as possible. Though
the natural vegetation in the San Diego
area is Chaparral, countless types of ﬂora
appear in' the landscapes of the zoo.
Beyond that is the scientiﬁc effort to pre~
serve and propagate species from all over
the world that would otherwise become
extinct.

In charge of San Diego’s research program since last year has

been Dr. Werner Heuschele, born in Ludwigsburg, in West Ger
many. He has a hard act to follow, that of his fellow German Dr.
Kurt Benirschke, a former professor at the medical schools of
Dartmouth and Harvard. He ran the zoo’s research program for
eleven years and remains on the 200’s board. A man deserving to
be known as a twentieth’century Noah, Benirschke turned his

nonpareil knowledge of human reproduction to animal studies.
Some 80 percent of Benirschke’s efforts were so practical that
Heuschele fully intends to continue them. In what Benirschke
calls his “frozen zoo,” a cell bank for endangered species, sperm
and ova are conserved. A cOmputer keeps track of donors and
receivers to prevent such relentless inbreeding as would result in
the creation of Jukes and Kallikaks in the animal world.
Heuschele is continuing his predecessor’s emphasis on pure
research, seeking to accumulate knowledge for its own sake,
whether or not it has any immediate practical application. He has
been investigating the spread of the herpes virus among wilde'
beests, for example, knowing that it has been afﬂicting cattle in

Like Benirschke, he gears most of his work to saving species
from extinction. They have had some heartening successes.

has been extinct in the wild, but Benirschke and other scientists
have raised the world herd from a total of fewer than twenty to

saved,” Benirschke warns. “So must the white rhino. ”

Zoos, too, will become endangered species unless administraa
tors continue to work hard for attendance and earn sufﬁcient pop,
ularity with voters to share the municipal trough with sewers,
schools, and the symphony. There are, of course, valleys as well as
peaks. The scandalous Atlanta Zoo was so shabbily run and so
cruel to its animals that it was suspended from the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, but it is now pur—
portedly pulling up its socks. The Houston Zoo’s stubbornly

trustees with Henry Clay Frick II, Robert G. Goelet, and Brooke
Astor. When Harvard University offers its alumni a cruise around
Madagascar and charges up to $6,670 for a single cabin, zoolatry
among the swells is obviously on the rise. (These luminaries not!
withstanding, zoos’ boards of trustees still tend not to rank as high
in the social pecking order as a museum’s, a symphony’s, or a
ballet’s.)

In the end, what brings 1 12 million Americans to zoos, animal
parks, and aquariums each year—more than to all football, basev
ball, and hockey games combined—is not status. It is, for one
thing, the staggering beauty of the creatures. More than that,
those hairy and often scary creatures reveal the breadth and exo—
ticism of nature. They remind us of our origins and let us know
we are still members of the animal kingdom. In San Diego,our wild
kin are on view every day of the year, at

LITTLETON -- After one pit bull
jumped a fence and killed a dog last month
and another pit bull attacked two children,
Littleton may become the first Colorado
city to ban the breed.

City Attorney Larry Berkowitz, who
drafted the proposal, Said he thinks the
dogs have been bred to fight and are lethal
weapons just waiting to strike.

But Glenna Brown, a Littleton resident .
who said her pit bull puppy is gentle with

. kittens and gets along with her 11-year-old
yellow Labrador-,is skeptical. _. .. .

that his worst act so far has been to chew '

But if the Littleton City Council approves

Zach would have to be moved outside the
city or put to sleep.

Brown hasn’t noticed the deadly instinct
in Zach, but it has been horrifyingly evident
in other pit bulls. In fact, 18 of 26 fatal ca~

since 1983 involved pit bulls, according to
statistics kept by the Humane Society.

Berkowitz wants to ensure Littleton isn’t
the scene of the next pit bull tragedy. The

Denver area officials have been
concerned about pit bulls since last
year when a Denver boy was fatal-
fly mauled. Many metro cities, in-
cluding Denver and Aurora, have
strengthened their vicious-dog stat-
utes but Littleton’s would be the
first law in Colorado specifically
aimed at pit bulls. Other cities na-
tionwide have banned the dogs;
Ohio is considering banning pit
bulls statewide. -

Pit bulls are as dangerous as ex-
: otic animals such as lions and ti-
gers, which aren’t allowed in resi-
- dential areas, Berkowitz said. ’

But Brown said the pit bull of-
fers protection. And, the widow
added, she would rather have Zach
than a gun.

“That’s one thing that scares
me. These dogs are dangerous and
if one gets out . . . a gun doesn’t get

Berkowitz said- .. ‘

“They’re kind of like canine
crocodiles. They bite and dig their
teeth in and through their genetic
development they can still grind
their molars and shake their vicv
tims, ripping the flesh off their
bones. They’re a unique animal,”
Gustavson said. ,

Other dog breeds may bite peo
ple more often, he conceded.

But while pit bulls are 2 percent
of the canine population, they ac-
count for 70 percent of fatal at-
tacks, and said Gustavson, “The
numbers justify singling out pit
bulls.”

Still, enthusiasts of the Ameri-
can Staffordshire Terrier and Staf-
fordshire Bull Terriers, breeds
commonly known as pit bulls, feel
persecuted. They say laws should
be aimed at owners, not dogs.
Three Cincinnati-area residents
have sued the city, calling its pit
bull ban unconstitutional. That suit
is pending.

But bans in New Mexico and
Kansas cities have been upheld by
courts, Gustavson and Berkowitz
said.

Veterinarians and other animal
experts have split over the ani-
mals’ viciousness and the need to
single out the breed for special
laws

Brown is unsure what she would

do with Zach if he becomes illegal .

in Littleton. “I’d hate to destroy
him, but I guess that’s what I‘d do
if I had to,” she said.

Several Cincinnati residents
brought their pit bulls to animal
shelters to be destroyed last year,
Gustavson said. Only two citation:
have been written since the law
took effect. - ' ~

“It has had an impact~ We
haven’t many problems because
it’s common knowledge that the
dogs are subject to confiscation,”
Gustavson said.

Littleton would rely on citizen
complaints to discover the illegal
pets, Berkowitz said. The law
would apply to dogs visiting or per-
manently kept in Littleton. Owners
would be subject to penalties of up
to $999 and 90 days in jail. ,

 

BOSTON GLOBE - July 6, 1987

Two more black ferrets born

A second litter of the world‘s rarest animal, the black—footed
ferret, has been born in a captive-breeding program intended to
save the species from extinction, say Wyoming game officials.
The two kits were born last Tuesday.

' - Six ferret kits were
born in June — the first
successful birth in cap—
tivity. Game officials
said there now are 24
ferrets in captivity.

The breeding
program was begun at
Sybille Canyon near
Wheatland in eastern
Wyoming after the dis-
covery of a colony of
black ferrets near Mee—
teetse, Wyo., in 1981.
Before then, the species
was believed to be ex-
tinct. After canine dis-
temper nearly wiped
out the colony in 1985,
the survivors were cap-
tured in hopes they
would breed in captiv-
ity.

Larry Kruckenberg,
. spokesman for the
state Game and Fish Department, said the second litter is sig—
nificant because one of the parents was an immature male that
had been in captivity since October, 1985. Researchers had
been concerned that male ferrets raised in captivity would be

incapable of breeding.

3.3-billion- year-old fossils found

Ancient fossils have been discovered in what is now Austra-
lia. The microfossils of bacteria lived 3.3 to 3.5 billion years
ago, making them among the oldest life—forms known.

Previously, one—celled fossils had been found in chert (a type

9 of rock) in western Australia, but the scientists said some ques-

tions had existed about the accuracy of their dating and identi-
fication. The new findings confirms the occurrence of the an—
cient microfossils, they said.

In addition, geologists J. William Schopf and Bonnie Packer
of the University of California at Los Angeles. reported in the
journal Science that the cell types of the newly found fossils

‘ suggest the bacteria may have produced oxygen.

If they were oxygen-producing, that would suggest the grad—
ual buildup of an oxygen atmosphere from organisms using the
process of photosynthesis must have occurred over a longer
portion of the Pre-Cambrian period than previously believed,
the scientists said. .

Earth is about 4.5 billion years old, but geological processes
have wiped out the earliest samples of the globe’s crust.

ATLANTA JOURNAL G CONSTITUTION — July 12, 1987

 

Laws needed to:

MITCHELL BROOKS/Staff

 

By Donald H. Cllﬂord

Special to The JournaLConstitution

 

Every week there are reports in newspapers, over ,

the radio, in news magazines and on television about
pe0ple being attacked, bitten, mauled or even killed by
pit bulls or pit bull-like dogs.

Where did these dogs come from and why are they
so p0pular? Are they inherently more dangerous than
other breeds? And if so, what can communities do to
protect their citizens from injury?

From observation of these animals as well as nu-
merous dog-bite statistics, it is becoming increasingly
apparent that pit bulls are indeed more dangerous. And
while ordinances aimed at restricting ownership of the
breed are almost certain to spark opposition from dog
clubs and dog fanciers, it is time for state and local
governments to consider such pr0posals. '

Pit bulls come from the British Isles, where farmers
at one time used their dogs for bull-baiting —- a savage
spurt in which dogs attacked a bull tethered on the vil-
lage green. Bull-baiting, which had become a national
sport, was outlawed in England in 1835.

Some enter rising individuals then bred their large
mastifis or bul dogs with terriers to produce a smaller,
more manageable animal. These dogs were used to fight
one another. The blood sport found its way to the United

States, where the American Staffordshire terrier and the,

the division of laboratory animal medicine at the Medi-
cal College of Ohio.

pit bulls

American pit bull terrier derived from English, Irish
and Scottish stock are the most closely associated with
dogfighting.

Until the 19703, the professional trainers of dogs.

fighting in illegal bouts knew their animals, securely
confined them and did not let them run at large. But
during the 19708, the clandestine circle of pit bull own-
ers, expanded to include gamblers, thrill seekers, drug
dealers and many others. The courage, loyalty and stam-
ina of pit bulls impressed people who needed guard dogs
and companion animals. The old taboos against breeding
bad dogs did not matter to
could announce a litter of pups in the local newspaper
or post a sign on a telephone pole. ’

The result is a large and dangerous suprpulation of
scatter-bred dogs with formidable bodies, jaws like a
crocodile’s and an innate fighting instinct.

. Many pit bull owners have found that the animals
can unexpectedly attack another animal, a child or an

elderly person in the family or down the block. An .

emergency room physician in Detroit Says that he treats
three or four pe0ple with severe pit bull bites each
week. In some instances, the patient is back for the
treatment of a second bite wound before the sutures of
the initial wound have been removed.

Bad dogs often will give

gerament or propensity to bite before a serious attack.

his is not always true with pit bulls; fighting stock
takes to combat naturally without provocation.

_ Dogs

The attribute that really sets pit
“bulls apart from other dogs is their
,gameness. This attribute compels a
dog to continue to attack or fight
regardless of how badly it is
injured.

‘ . It is difficult to determine the
true percentage of pit bulls in the
canine population, Since many dogs
are unlicensed, mislicensed or sim-
ply licensed as crossbreds, mixed

FROM 10

 

breds or mongrels. But there is.

growing evidence that they are re-
sponsible for a disproportionate
number of dog-bite injuries.

7 Last year, a symposium at Tufts

University reported that there are
about 12 human deaths each year
due to dogs in the United States,
and that pit bulls cause about one-
half of those fatalities. A dog con-
. trol official in Clearwater, Fla., said
’_ last year that his statistics show pit
. bulls are six times more likely to
bite than the average purebred dog.
. In Toledo, Ohio, in 1983, there
were 41 bites reported in a popula-
tion of 424 licensed pit bulls, or a
ratio of roughly 1-to-10. The compa-
rable ratio for Doberman pinschers
and German shepherds was 1-to-20.
The extent of the injury caused
by a dog bite is also an important
consideration. A 1985 study showed
that of the 5, 711 dog- -bite incidents
reported to five South Carolina
health departments during a three-
year period, 16 attacks were classi-
fied as severe. Five of the 16 cases
involved pit bulls. The greater dam-
age caused by a pit bull bite is not
surprising, since the animal contin-
ues to keep its hold and has twice
the biting power of similarly sized
dogs-
What is the solution to the pit
. bull problem?

Usually the first step is to
strengthen a community’ 5 animal
control program. Sometimes this in-
volves more‘ vehicles, more person-
nel and better training. But often
ordinances must be changed. In
some communities, there is no leash
law, while there are states which do
not require that dogs be vaccinated
against rabies.

The passage of such ordinances
can be helpful, but only if the
courts prosecute offenders. Some
judges consider infractions of the
leash law or dog-bite attacks as un-
important and require the offending
owner to pay only a token fine.

A second step is to enact re-
strictive ordinances that are breed-
specific. The following requirements

should be considered in such an ~

ordinance:

I Identification of a pit bull by
tattoo and special collar. Tattooing
is designed to decrease dog stealing,

1M

facilitate the return of lost dogs and
aid in identification of those that
have caused injury. A special collar
alerts pe0ple that a dog is danger-
ous or vicious. The color should be
uniform. '

I Confinement of the pit bull on
a chain, either in an enclosed yard
or a secure structure. Some ordi-
nances specify the height of the
fence and require that the gate or
entrance to the structure be locked.

A screen door does not represent a.

secure enclosure, and dogs have at-
tacked mail carriers after jumping
through such doors.

I Limiting ownership to adults.
This will decrease cases of dogfight-
ing and inappropriate use of dogs
by teenagers.

I Requiring liability. insurance.

This requirement is aimed at pro-‘ ~

tecting the victim of an attack and
restricting ownership to those peo«
ple who can provide for the proper
control of such dogs. Such insurance
is available through homeowners’ or
renters’ policies

I Submission of two color pho-
tographs at the time of licensing.
This complements tattoing as a
means of identification.

I Reporting to authorities of
significant events, such as change of
ownership or euthanasia.

I Filing a pedigree of three
generations. This would help to de-
termine if a dog was derived from
a bench and obedience line or was
a random-bred animal from dog-
fighting stock.

I Muzzling of the pit bull when
it is off the owner’s pr0perty. Muz-
zling may or may not be effective,
depending on the type of muzzle
and how it is applied; but it serves
as a warning;

I Limiting the number of adult
dogs in a household, except when
the owner has a kennel license. Such
a limit prevents dogs’ running in a
pack. Two or more dogs are much
more dangerous than a single ani-
mal, especially when they are large.

Michigan has experienced a se-
vere pit bull problem. Eight pit»
bulls in Kalamazoo were shot by po-
lice officers during a recent six-
month period, and two officers were
injured. As a result, the Michigan
Senate has passed a bill providing
for statewide pit bull registration.
The bill would require that owners
of these dogs be over 21 years of
age, have liability insurance of
$100,000 and furnish two colored
photographs and a pedigree of three
generations.

The Michigan bill may have
flaws and it may be difficult to en-
force, but it is worth a try. For the
sake of children who are defenseless
against uncontrolled pit bulls, let us
hope that other states will follow
the Michigan example. "

FORT WORTH —— The city’s
zoo director, Elvie Turner, has
spent much of his 58 years study-
ing animal behavior, but he’s baf-
ﬂed by his own species in the
heated battle over the city me-

inagerie.

Would gobble up every available

vocal group of opponents
launched what has become one of
the most savage debates in Fort

Opponents, who call them-
selves the Forest Park Associa-
tion, say they fear the zoo plan,

sponsored by the exclusive Fort

being railroaded past the citizen-
ry by the city’s business and so-
cial elite.

The plan would more than dou—
ble the size of the 40-acre zoo by
the year 2002 and replace old-
fashioned cages with spacious
natural exhibits. It also proposes
that the $2 entrance fee eventual-
ly be tripled. .

The $85,000 cost of preparing
the plan was paid by Ramona
Bass; an association member and

-wife of millionaire Lee Bass, said

Cleve Lancaster, the 200’s educa-
tion supervisor.

Neighboring homeowners and
athletic groups reacted in horror

when they found out the zoo

planned to take over the center of

- the 198-a‘cre park, pushing athlet-

ic fields and picnic areas to the
park’s undeveloped fringes.

The Forest Park pool, one of .

the city’s oldest and most popular
public swimming holes, would be
closed under the plan. Tennis
courts on the park’s south side al-
ready have been closed to make
way for an exhibit dedicated to
Texas wildlife.

Because membership in the
zoological association is by invita-
tion only and traditionally limited
to the city’s elite, its sponsorship
of the plan has only heightened
suspicions among the Opposition.

“They didn’t present us with
the (200’s) problems,” said Shir-
ley- Johnson, a former city coun-
cilwoman. “They presented a fait
accompli.”

One expansion foe compared
Forest Park to New York’s Cen-

tral Park and San Francisco’s . ,

Golden Gate Park.

“Open‘ space has always been
an integral part of the great cities
of the world. It goes all the way

inadequate restrooms and conces-

F.W. zoo panel feeling pressure
to accept less—wealthy donors

By Jacquielynn Floyd
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

 

FORT" WORTH — In San An-

tonio, , 700 people are voting
members of the the city’s zoologi-
cal society, a private, non-proﬁt
body formed to help support that
city’s zoo. _ i

In New Orleans, 35,000 house-
holds can choose the leadership
of a similar associatiOn supporting
the city’s Audubon Zoo.

Voting members of the Zoolog—

, ical Society of San Diego total

more than 200,000, all of whom
have a say in who gets elected to
the board of trustees.

But in Fort Worth, only 46 peo-
ple belong to the Zoological Asso-

ciation. They are the board of di—'

rectors and no one else can join
unless invited by the board.

The structure of the private as—
sociation, which even some mem-
bers have questioned, dates back
to May 1972, when an 18-month
fight over zoo policies ended with
the closing of the Fort Worth
body to the public.

The membership that re—
mained, zoo Director Elvie Turn-
er says, came mostly from Fort
Worth’s business and social, elite,
many of them descendants of a
handful of powerful Fort Worth
families that chartered the group
in the 19505.

While 200 support groups in
most cities actively solicit new
members to bring in donations as
small as $20, the Fort Worth Zoo-
logical Association restricts mem-
bership to big-money contribu—
tors or socially inﬂuential people
active in the zoo.

The association’s exclusivity
has been a major issue in a city
battle over efforts to expand the

200 through the year 2002. As 1

part of the effort to halt a dou-

bling of the 200’s size, opponents .

are calling for elimination of
what they say is “an elitist associ-
ation board.”

Ann Marek, a longtime neigh-
borhood advocate, recently called

for “a democratic zoological asso- .

ciation that represents the popu—
lation of Fort Worth, not just Riv—
ercrest and Westover Hills.”

But association members say
their membership is not limited
to those two well—heeled neigh-
borhoods.

“There’s only three of us from
Westover Hills,” said association
President Gene Fisher, a resident

of that neighborhood. “But if you ’

look at the roster, we’ve got peo—
ple from all parts of town.”

From Fisher’s perspective, the
association is merely a philan—
thropic group of citizens who
over the years have made gener-
ous gifts to the 200.

Even as they defend their
body, however, association mem-
bers say they are drafting plans
to open their group to moderately
priced memberships for less-
wealthy donors.

While reluctant to criticize the
Fort Worth association, zoo group
members in other cities say they
don’t know of any similar opera-
tions elsewhere.

“A lot of zoos may have been
that way in the past, but I don’t
know of any that are (that way)
now,” said Paula Schlinger, direc-
tor of the Dallas Zoological Soci-
ety, now in the midst of an active
membership drive.

“That is a very unique situation l

they have in Fort Worth,” said a
Tulsa Zoo Friends member who
declined to give her name. “Ours
has always been open.”

:Zoowants panda pact down in black an

By Alexander Friedric
Staff Writer

”Ifor Zoo Atlanta, “mission pan-
da “is beginning to look like it will
be misswn possible” — thanks to

some prodding from _ a former I

president.
The zoo has been trying to ar-
range avrsit of a pair of the black-
and-white =bearlike mammals for

several months, according to zoo Di-
rector Terry Maple. Although such
exhibits sometimes take years to
negotiate with China, the animals’
native land, Atlanta might get its
exhibit as early as next year, Chi-
nese officials hinted during former
Presrdent Jimmy Carter’s recent
trip to China. ~

“Things would have gone a bit
slower if it weren’t for him," Maple

said Sunday.

The popularity of the pandas
has made them a rare catch for
zoos, Maple said. Since the Chinese
government stapped giving pandas
to American zoos, requests for visits
from the animals have been tremeno
dons, and there is a waiting list of
zoos seeking to be host for one of
the three- to six-month exhibits.

i said his country would comply with
:the request because Carter “is the
man who normalized relations with
A the People’s Republic of China.”
q Though Maple hasn’t received
{an official response from the Chi-
" nese, he said they are “looking very
:favorably” on Atlanta’s request. He
said he was told it took seven years

Although Chinese officials have
hinted the pandas might be avail-

time for the visit would be in 1989,
the 200’s centennial year.

“This would allow us to build
the best possible panda habitat,” he
said.

The season in which, the pandas
visit also will be a consideration.
Because of Atlanta’s temperate cli-
mate, the Chinese may require in»
door quarters for the pandas during
summer months, Maple said.

Food is another factor. Fortu-
nately, Georgia grows the anda’s
main staple -- bamboo. “So guess
we’ve. got that problem licked,” he
said with a laugh. In fact, Maple
said, the state already supplies

would not have been possible for at

the pandas, an endangered species,
also would be important, he said.

“We want pe0ple to be aware of .
the crisis,” he said. “We want to tell ;
the story of how pandas live in the
wild and why we should preserve
them. Pandas are highly endan-
gered, and wildlife conservation is a
very important issue that Ameri-
cans should be concerned about. If:
the pandas are so close to extinc-
tion, and they are, then it’s a very‘;

that they could become extinct.”

Maple said he wants Atlanta to

TAMPA TRIBUNE -'Ju1y 7, 1987

Gillette closes lab, _
denies protest cause

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA —- The Boston-based

Gillette Co. has closed its medical
evaluation laboratory, but not be-
cause of complaints by animal
rights activists, a company official
said Monday.
, Product testing on animals will
continue but will be done by accred-
ited outside laboratories under con-
tract to Gillette, said Dick Gauthier,
the company’s manager of public
relations.

In recent months, animal rights
groups have staged demonstrations
in cities throughout the United
States and Canada protesting toxici-
ty and irritability tests on animals
at the Gillette laboratory.

Last week, People for the Ethi-
cal Treatment of Animals (PETA)
held a demonstration at a U-Save
grocery store in Tampa after the
store rejected the group’s request to
remove Gillette products from its
shelves. Six other grocery and drug-
store chains contacted by PETA al-
so refused to remove the products.

Gauthier said the closing of the
laboratory in Rockville, Md., in
March was part of Gillette’s restruc-
turing program, made necessary af-
ter the Revlon Group Inc.’s hostile
corporate takeover attempt of the
company last November.

Revlon tried to take over Gil-
lette again last month, but Gillette
was able to reject the move under a
“standstill agreement” the two com-

panies reached at the end of the
first takeover battle in November.
Myriam Parham, local director
of PETA, said she is not satisfied
with Gillette’s closing of the Rock-
ville laboratory because the compa-
ny’s products still will be tested on

A animals elsewhere.

1 Products such as shaving cream
and ink are dripped into rabbits’
eyes or rubbed into their skin to test
for harmful effects, and many ani-
mals die, she said.

But Gauthier said all companies
dealing with personal-care products
do such testing to ensure the prod-
nets are safe for human use.

Gauthier and Harold Tidwell, di-
rector of purchasing for the Tampa
area’s U-Save supermarkets, ques-

tioned whether PETA’s Tampa

demonstration was fair, considering
the hundreds — if not thousands -’-—' ‘
of stores that carry Gillette prod-‘
ucts locally _'
Tidwell said he supports PETA’s '
concerns. He said he met with a Gil- ,,
lette representative after receiving
PETA’s letter requesting the prod- '
uct removal and passed along the:
group’s complaints. ~
“All our competitors use Gillette! ‘
products,” he said. “We’ re not
against them (PETA). We’ re not for :
cruelty to animals But we’ re not go- ‘
ing to go take these products off our.
shelves as long as the customers"
want them.” "2
Members of PETA will meet
Thursday night, Parham said, to dis- '-
cuss whether to take further action“?

 




IB / The Houston Post/Sat, July H, 1987 *

Animal control
iowling success de

y BRENDA SAPINO
ost Reporter

 

Houston’s animal control offi-
2rs are proving in a big way that
ley can do more with less.

In the fiscal year just ended, the

ty’s so-called dog catchers re-
irded a 422 percent increase in
1e number of citations issued to
at owners who let their animals
In loose or failed to get them li-
ansed or vaccinated.

They did it all with six fewer offi-

ars than the previous fiscal year,
hen 70 officers patrolled the
reets.

“The officers are sharper,” said
r. Robert Armstrong, head of the
ty’s animal control operations.

“They look better in their uni-
irms. They get more respect. We
ow have fewer officers doing
tore.”

Besides writing up citizens at a
ecord pace — 4,938 in the fiscal

ear endedJune 30, compared to

946 the previous year — animal
control officers are also locking up
more stray pets and ones that bite
people. ~

Officers picked up 23,378 ani-
mals in FY 1987, compared to
22,852 the year before, Armstrong
said. -
Armstrong said the officers are
writing more citations because
they are more confident judges in
the municipal courts will find the
dog owners guilty.

Previously, officers simply is-
sued warnings or tried some solu-
tion other than citing an errant pet
owner, Armstrong said.

Since consulting 'with municipal
judges about the applicable laws,
Armstrong said, the animal control
officers know what is needed to
make a citation stick in court.

“When my officer goes out to
write citations, he knows what’s
needed to prosecute,” Armstrong
said.

The fines range from $50 for
failure to license a pet to $600 for

g‘ ﬁe,

  
  

allowing a dangerous animal ——
such as one that has bitten some-
one -— to run loose.

The increase in citations appar- ‘
ently has had an impact in another '

statistic watched closely by animal
control workers: animal bites. That
number dropped 30 percent in fis-
cal 1987 to 2,102, compared to
3,003 the previous year. '

Said Armstrong: “We’ve put
gram of these animals behind

ars.”

Patty Mercer, executive director
for the Houston Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals, said
she is glad the city is cracking
down on violators of animal control
laws.

“We would like to see more of
the animals off the streets,” Mercer
said, explaining that it is difficult to
identify an injured animal that is
not licensed.

She said issuing citations punish-
es the pet owner rather than the
“innocent” animal.

PALMETTO —- Lynne Lacy was
getting around OK.

Even though she was blinded in
an accident three years ago, the 22-
year-old Tampa resident managed
to hold a job and attend school, nav-
igating the University of South Flor-
ida campus with the aid of keen
ears and a trusty cane.

But recently, while on the way
to a class, Lacy had a run-in with a
parked tractor that convinced her
she wasn’t getting around 0K
enough.

“I decided right then and there
that I needed another mobility aid,”
she said. “A dog.”

A short time later, she 'met
Lance, a brindle boxer with sunken
jowls, a trim physique and warm
brown eyes. Lance has taken Lacy
as close to independence as she
could go without eyesight. '

Lacy says she never would have
met Lance if not for Southeastern
Guide Dogs, the only school of its
type in the South, graduating stu-
dents from as far as Texas and

'North Carolina. It is ’one of only 10

guide-dog schools in the United

’ States.

Some call the canines at these
schools “Seeing Eye Dogs,” but ac-
tually that is a trade name designat-
ed only for dogs who graduate from
a guide-dog school in New Jersey.

As Lacy relaxes in Southeast~
ern’s lounge one day before gradua-
tion, Lance cleans himself on the
floor beside her, tethered by a slack
leash. They look comfortable to-
gether even though they met only
25 days ago.

Lacy remembers that day not
only as her first meeting with
Lance, but also as the day she part-
ed with her cane.

“At first it was really tough, giv-
ing up that cane,” she says. “You
build a dependence on it. With the
dog, it’s kind of like trusting some-

. one else, and that’s hard to do.”

Southeastern Guide Dogs leads
cents toward independence

' By WARREN EPSTEIN

Southeastern Guide Dogs works
toward that goal of transforming hu-

man and dog into a single, trusting.

unit years before the two meet.
It starts with the acquisition and

breeding of the dogs. Sixty-five per- —-'—-—-———-......_

cent of the dogs are bred in the

school’s breeding program and the '

remainder are donated.

Most of the dogs used are re-
triever breeds, but the school also

has some German and Australian

shepherds. They all go through ex-
tensive medical examinations and ,
are screened or bred for even tem—
peraments and a willingness to T5

learn and accept responsibility.

As puppies, they are given to
volunteer foster homes, where they
learn to get along with people and

to deal with all the sights and

sounds of daily life.

Then about a year later, the ‘

dogs are returned to the school —
often after some parting tears -- for
a four- to six-month training period.

They must learn about 40 com-
mands that their blind partners will
give them. But, more important,

they have to learn “intelligent dis- .

obedience.” That means that if their
masters tell them, “Forward!” and
they see a car coming, they have to
ignore the command.

After this preliminary training
program, the dogs are given to their
blind partners —- although the
school still retains legal ownership
-- and the six-legged couples begin
a 26-day curriculum.

Because the school days are
long and intense, the blind students
are required to stay in Southeast-
ern’s dormitories —-— humble facili-
ties, but no worse than those at
USF. ‘

' Each day the students go on

field trips to malls, grocery stores,
country roads, downtown Bradenton
or downtown Tampa. _,

During a recent trek down the
streets of downtown Tampa, Lacy,
three other students and their dogs
and two instructors got a chance to
show how effective the school’s
techniques are.

"Find curb!” Lacy commands,
and Lance guided her to the curb
on Franklin Street at Jackson Street
and stopped. Had he continued, they
would have been introduced to a
speeding bus and several cars.

' "Good boy," she cooed, patting
him on his back. .

All of the dogs obeyed their
blind partners, and although they
glanced curiously at a passing
mounted policeman on Kennedy
Boulevard, they didn’t chase him.
They didn’t even relieve themselves
until their masters told them to.

. Behind Lacy, Marion Gwizdala
1— a USF graduate student -— and

his German shepherd, Princess, go

,_ through similar commands.

Gwizdala said he thinks his dog
helps him most in busy malls,
where he’d sometimes had trouble
maneuvering with his cane.

“In the mall, you walk through a
crowd and people don’t really get
out of the way. It’s like they don’t
believe you’re really blind,” he said.
“But with a boxer or a German
shepherd -— these are the kind of
dogs people get out of the way for.”

Unfortunately, those who don’t
get out of the way like to pet and
play with the dogs —— unfortunate,
because it makes the dogs forget
about the their jobs.

“It’s a difficult problem getting

,the public to leave our dogs alone,”

he said. “That distracts the dog. All
they need is one second of distrac-
tion and they’ll walk us into a pole.”
But even with the hassles from
the public, Gwizdala said he’s glad
he has Princess and feels much
more confident and independent.
That’s the school’s goal. South-
eastern officials stress that message

]. with their slogan, “Paws for Inde-

pendence.”

Southeastern board member and
public relations representative Shir-
ley Tait said she’s amazed to see
how well graduates achieve that
goal after they finish the course and
spend a few years with their dogs.

“To see them walk into my
home, independent, without any
canes —— it’s a wonderful, wonderful
thing,” she said.

Since the school began in 1982,
Tait said they have graduated just
over 100 dogs and 100 students.

Each class has eight students or
less and two instructors. Tait said
she would like to have more stu-
dents, but the school doesn’t have

enough dormitory space to accom- _

modate them.

Filling the existing spots is never
a problem. Trainer Sue Abramovich

said there is a waiting list of about
200 applicants.

But Southeastern administrator
Michael Sergeant said he wants peo-
ple in the Bay area to know that
they get priority over those outside
the region. He said he doesn’t think
Bay area applicants would have to
wait more than four or six months
to get in.

Of course, Floridians can go to
out-of—state schools, but Southeast-
ern officials warn that man of those
schools charge a fee a $200 or
more and their dogs artist as well
adapted to this environment.

“The dogs here are born and
raised with the heat, fleas and para-
sites and the non-sidewaik areas of
Florida,” Abramovich said. “They
can deal with it.”

Even with these adaptive abili-
ties and their training, occasionally
the dog~student relationship doesn’t
work out.

Tait told the story of one dog :

who had a habit of perpetually lead-
ing his human partner inia poles. At
first, officials thought were was a
flaw in his training. "than they

e For Licensin Cots  

By Erik Ingram

Marin County supervisors
sniffed the political wind and
refused to even take a vote yes-
terday on a suggestion to li-
cense the county’s cats.

“Cat owners would have been
clawing the walls if we had adopted
this ordinance,” Supervisor Robert
Roumiguiere said after the brief
hearing. “It’s another intrusion by
government that I think would cost
more than it would bring in.”

Only Supervisor Robert Stock-
well, who admittedly does not like
cats, wanted to see the tabbies tag-
ged for identification purposes.

“A lot of people love them and
93 percent that end up at the shelter
get snuffed out,” he said.

Stockwell's motion to require
the licenses died when none of the

. other supervisors would second it.

The licensing ordinance was
first urged by a watchdog taxpayers
group, United Taxpayers of Marin.
as a way to equalize animal control
costs between dog and cat owners.

Cat owners pay only a $5—aday
impound fee to bail out their pet.

The Marin Humane Society,
which runs the county’s animal con-
trol program, backed the prOposal.
Members said it would protect cats
and increase the number of strays
returned to owners.

Diane Allevato, executive di
rector of the Humane Society, dis
agreed with Roumiguiere‘s assess
ment of costs. -

Any income would be a net
gain over the current situation, she ..
said. ' ' ‘

“We see it as an education tool
but if we can’t educate the supervi-l
sors (to the need), then obviously we .‘
have a long way to go with the com-;
munity,” said Allevato. .,

She said she knows of no com-i
munity in California with a success-
ful cat-licensing program, but noted 4
that one has been in operation ini
Seattle for 50 years. .

Leaping Lizards! Animals in Ads Capture Center Stage

From Cool, Collected Dogs to Shltlish Pigeons,

NEW YORK—Beautiful women, babies and
animals.

A long-time truism on Madison Avenue
has been that any of the above can be the
key to an attention grabbing commercial.
While Beautiful People 1n general—and
theii infant counterparts—continue to be
popular, there appears to have been an in-
crease in the number and variety of feath-
ered and furry creatures helping to pitch the
nation’s products and services.

A few enormous vultures devouring a
heap of garbage, for example, was one of
the touches director Rob Lopes added to

NEW YORK—Depending on their sociabil-
ity, lions and tigers and bears at zoos all
across the U.S. are wallowing in the
benefits of advertising and marketing.
More and more zoos are discovering
that higher public awareness can lead to
higher attendance, says Tom LeRock,
chairman of the public relations commit-
tee of the American Association of Zoo—
logical Parks and Aquariums. “When
goveinment funds got squeezed in the
late ’70s and early ’80s, an awareness
about advertising [for zoos] began and is
building momentum, ” says LeRock. “As
government funds get tighter, earned
revenue becomes more im-

In another publicity effort, Kenner
Parker Toys plunked down some 20,000
pounds of Play—D011 on the grounds of the
zoo and invited New Orleans architects to
build animals. “The amount of publicity
we got for that event was incredible,”
says Karen Asis, director of public rela-
tions at the zoo.

To successfully market,

on, and that’s just
in the area of non—
pet-oriented ad-
veitising.

While animals
are practically a
prerequisite in
pet-food spots,
their use has be-
come more unusu-
al and creative—
from flying ca—
nines to singing
cats to that little
tyke of a dog who
keeps jumping
over the bulldog in J. Walter Thompson’s
Kibbles ’n Bits commercial.

Len Brook, co-director of Dawn Animal
Agency, one of New York’s largest animal
suppliers for ads and films, notes an increase
in the use of beasts and fowl and doesn’t see
the trend waning. “My theory is that in this
day and age, with more technology, this is
one little bit of naturalness people are look-
ing for,” Brook says, as birds chirp away in
the background. “They want to get away
from the ‘digital this’ and ‘digital that.’ ”

Brook, who runs the business with his
wife and daughter, keeps some animals in
Dawn’s New York office for last-minute
jobs. Most of the fauna, however, are on a
New Jersey farm, where Dawn houses crea—
tures ranging, as Brook puts it, “from spi—
ders and flies to a herd of elephants and ev-
erything in between.” Dawn will be moving
soon to a larger farm, where Brook
says agencies will be able to shoot on
location.

Dawn provided the chickens for 0&M’s
Hardee’s spot. Asked if chickens weren’t the
most stupid and difficult of birds, Brook re-
plied, “Not my chickens!” He says agencies
that think they can save money by using un—
trained animals are fooling themselves.

Whether viewers notice that difference,
they tend to sit up and take notice when ani-
mals appear on screen. Linda Hanrahan,
president of Animals for Advertising in New
York, believes that “it keeps [viewers] from
going to the refrigerator when they see
something furry 0r feathered.”

Demand for certain animals seems to go
in cycles. “One week it will be nothing but
rats,” Hanrahan says. “Last week was frog
week. This week is cat and dog week.” One
of Hanrahan’s feline stars, Tyrone, was the
cat in the Philips light bulb spot. Hanrahan
says Tyrone actually got fan mail after ap—
pearing in a Japanese commercial.

One of Hanrahan’s favorite war stories in-

_ standing beside a prosciutto, the bird was
required to fly into the air. What director
Stephen Marro didn’t know was that doves
love to roost, not ﬂy off—even when he used
a fog horn to terrorize it into doing so. In the
end, the effect was achieved by reversing
the ﬁlm of the bird landing.

Such tales are common among ad agen-
cies and their animal suppliers, which tend
to be concentrated near major ad centers.

In the Los Angeles area, most animal sup-
pliers do the lion’s share of their business for
films, but companies such as Cougar Hill
Ranch work with ad agencies as well. Nick
Toth, Cougar Hill’s owner, trainer and gen-

eral manager, believes that one reason peo- .

ple especially like more exotic animals in
commercials is simply that they just don’t
often get to see them. “When they do see
them, they’re drawn to them,” Toth says.

Director Lopes of Pfeifer Lopes Produc-
tions enjoys putting animals into spots that
don’t necessarily call for them, such as the
white, fan-tailed pigeons that gave a Euro-
pean atmosphere to WRG’S Walking Feet
spot for Pan Am. (He was going to have
crabs skittering across the sand in a beach
segment, but the critters became sluggish
when exposed to the lights.) Lopes also has
worked with animals already in the story-
board, such as WRG’s Cows series for Chex
cereals. One recent spot depicts a herd of bo-
vine beauties storming a suburban house to
protest the family’s practice of eating Chex
without milk.

“I ﬁnd animals to be a strange comic de-
vice,” Lopes says. “Each has a personality.
. . . An animal can sometimes very quickly
evoke a feeling from you.” Of an orangutan,
he says, “In his countenance, [there] is a lot
of gentleness and a lot of sadness.”

In explaining the perennial popularity of
animals in entertainment, Lopes says:
“When people get wounded or disappointed
by humankind, there’s always an animal to
give affection. There’s something incredibly
consistent about an animal.”

0&M creative director Mike Pitts, who
was involved in the Hardee’s chicken spot,
also worked on 0&M’s series of Duracell
spots, which also put live animals to work.
“Animals are so much a part of the human
landscape that they, in their way, add their
own touch of humanity,” Pitts theorizes.
“We project so many human characteristics
on animals that they become human.”

Pitts recalls a Saatchi & Saatchi Compton
spot for British Airways in which the roof of
an airplane lifted, and a bird made an ap-
pearance at the end. “In a lot of ways,” Pitts
observes, “the bird said a lot more about the
humanity of the airline than one more stu-

pid, smiling face leaning back in a seat.” E]

Another problem in popularizing
camels was cultural: Europeans who
settled the Western Hemisphere were
horsemen. , _.

A camel, which spits to show its
displeasure, can outrun a horse and
go two or three weeks without water,
Beverly noted, though she added that
the camel’s flat and ﬂeshy feet aren‘t
as suitable as a horse’s hooves for
rocky terrain. Camels are smarter

“It generates revenue and traffic
for the zoo” as well as income for the
Nevilles, the couple said.

But at one spot, the camel ride
grew so popular the zoo decided to
train its own animals, displacing the
Neville‘s operation.

That may lead them to a sideline.
They are trying to get into the cam
el-breeding business so they will have
animals for sale.

The Nevilles have put George, 15,
in the same corral as Lady, 9, in
hopes of generating a little romance.
There hasn‘t been any, so far, but

Pet or Killer?

7 are available—Blithe Humane Society
{of the United States says that since

July 1983, pit bulls have been responsi-

gble for 20 of the 28 deaths after dog
*-bites in the nation,‘ including all five

this year. The breed accounts for per-
haps 1 percent of all dogs in the nation.

The most publicized recent attack
came in June when a chained pit bull
guarding a marijuana crop in Califor-
nia fatally mauled a 21/2-year-old boy.

Largely as a result of pit bulls, more

“It’s gotten to the point where any-

, Both proponents and critics of the
dogs see a similar process at work.
They say pit bulls are increasingly
being bought by careless owners or
owners who are intentionally training
them to be vicious watchdogs or attack
dogs. The dogs have become increas—
ingly popular with youth gangs and
drug dealers, officials say.
‘Wild, Savage, Ugly’
As a result, the most dangerous tend-
encies of the dogs are being enhanced.
“There is a new type of pit bull com-
ing about — wild, savage, ugly, uncon-
, trollable,” said Samuel McClain, a-for-
mer investigator with the Society for
', the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in
‘ Philadelphia. “You can tell by the
' names —— Homicide, Switchblade,
Crazy Pete. They breed what we call
wacky dogs, father and daughter,
. mother and son.”
He said that of the 3,000 or so pit bulls

used for dogfighting. .
The trend and the public fury toward
pit bulls is particularly troubling to
longtime breeders. .
“The problem is not with the dogs,
it’s with the owners,” said Ms.,Nugent,
the Houston breeder. “It’s a more diffi-
cult dog to raise than some, and not
everyone should have one. The trouble
is it has become the macho dog to have,
‘ so the wrong people want them, and the,
right people don’t.” ' '

long a new breed will become the na-
tion’s mean dog of choice.

Many animal groups agree that

She contends pit bulls may already,
be peaking in popularity and before,

E, .But they say a large percentage of
_- pit bulls have always been raised for
combat. And they stress that pit bulls,
if raised improperly, pose special dan-
, gers because of their breeding for com-
bat and their ferocious bite. Pit bulls
tend to hang on and rip into flesh. They
are also less sensitive to pain, so they
are harder to dislodge while attacking.
. The backlash against the dogs is
showing up in different ways. Animal
[shelters report a growing number of
people turning their dogs in for “dis
posal.” There have also been several
reports of attacks on the dogs. In Kan-
sas City a pit bull burned to death when
p a gasoline bomb was thrown into its en-
closure. .
. But some people concerned 'with the
issues say the furor says as much
about humans as about pit bulls.
“People determine whether dogs will
be useful inhabitants of a community
or nuisances,” an attorney, Lynn
Marmer, concluded in an analysis of
dog-control laws for the University of
Cmcmnati Law Review. “It is the peo-

By The Associated Press
_ LEBANON, Ohio - A county
judge deferred a decision Tuesday

' on whether a beer-drinking, cigar

rette-smoking chimpanzee named
Sam should be returned to his TV-
and radio-equipped cage in a tav-
ern.

Warren County Common. Pleas
JudgeﬂNeal Bronson heard two
hours of testimony, then said he
would decide within a week wheth-
er to return the chimp to his home.

Members of the Humane Society
of the United States contend that
Sam was mistreated at the Train
Stop Inn in Fosters, a southwestern
Ohio village about 20 miles north-
east ot‘ Cincinnati.

Proprietor Kenneth Harris was
acquitted of criminal charges of
cruelty to animals in June by 3
Warren County Common Pleas
Court jury.

Afterward, however, Bronson is- ,

sued a restraining order at the re
quest of the Humane Society that
prevented Sam from being releas-
ed

Harris’ attorney, James Sheets,
was angry that Bronson didn’t de-
cide the case Tuesday. -

“It’s absolutely ludicrous,”
Sheets said. “It was fun for a
while, but it’s time to get this non-
sense over with.”

Harris said earlier Tuesday that
he was preparing the chimp’s
cage, which is equipped with a
television, a radio and a lamp, for
Sam’s return.

“I’m just getting ready. I’ve
been doing a little touch-up wor ”
he said.

Harris, who has owned the 16-
year-old chimp for about four
years, said an inspector from the
U.S. Department of Agriculture
has inspected and approved the
cage.

 

ct -

Members of the Humane Soci-
ety’s Great Lakes chapter in Bowl-
ing Green, Ohio, said they were ap-
palled by the chimp’s living
conditions when they visited the
bar earlier this year.

Tina Nelson, spokeswoman for
the Humane Society of the United
States, said Sam was given insuffi-
cient food and water, and was not
given enough exercise.

In addition, she said the Humane
Society objected to the chimp be-
ing given beer and lighted ciga-

. rettes by bar patrons. -

“None of the chimpanzee’s so-
cial conditions were met,” Nelson
said. “Sam ought to be able to live
as a chimpanzee in an adequate en-
vironment.” '

Harris has maintained that he
has done nothing to harm the
chimp, and that the separation has
been'anguishing for both him and
Sam.

The incident started around 7:15

crawled under the fence and went
across the street to a home in the
1300 block of Waterloo where the
male pit bull attacked a German

The two dogs then went into the

ST. LOUIS POST—DISPATCH - June 24, 1987

How Much Is The Life or An Animal Worth?

Michael E. DeBakey’s June 15 Com-
. mentary defending medical research on
impounded animals ignores several im-
-, portant issues.
, First, animal experimentation is
largely unregulated and rife wi .h
abuses. Many experiments conducted in
the name of scientific progress are re-
dundant or trivial, serving only to pad
the experimenter’s vita or to indulge his
' or her sadism.

Second, the data obtained from ani-
mal experiments don’t necessarily ap-
ply to humans. Thalidomide, which
caused an outbreak of tragic birth de-
fects, had been thoroughly tested on ani-
mals and judged safe.

Third, we already know how to pre-
vent the major killers in this country.
Heart disease, cancer and accidents re-
‘ suit from lifestyle choices. Animals do
not smoke, tan, stuff themselves with
rich junk, play with guns or refuse to‘

' ' wear seatbelts. They should not pay the

price for the fools who do.

Fourth, most impounded animals are
companion animals whose human '
friends have deserted them. That these
animals are so numerous is the fault of
lazy, negligent owners. To compound
these animals’ misery and betrayal by
torturing them in labs is grotesquely un-
fair. We owe them humane care -— or
else a quick and painless death.

Last, and most important, animals are
not tools (as DeBakey so callously puts
it) for us to use according to our whim.
They are living, sentient beings who feel
pain and pleasure, terror and trust, just
as we do. Any experiment too horrible

_ to perform on humans is also too horri-
, ble to perform on animals. Alternative
' ' research te - .22iques exist, more must be

‘ dev.elopecl dntil they are, we must work
, .3 ‘ within ethical limits, however inconve-

nient. For us to exploit and tvrannize

\

other species simply because we have
the power to do so vitiates the very
claim to superiority usually used to jus-
tify that power.

The Mrazek bill will not stop scientific ‘

research. It is merely a small step to-
ward a more rational, less violent world.
It deserves everyone’s support. '
Diana Blackwell
Columbia, Mo.

Michael DeBakey would have us be-

lieve that instead of quick, painless eu-

thanasia, homeless animals would be
better off used as helpless, unwilling
tools in horribly painful, repetitive ex-
periments in which the ”data may or "
may not be extrapolated to humans.
Does he really believe that Americans
are so gullible that we will fall for any-
thing that ﬂies under the flag of
science? ’

In our well- founded disillusionment
with the scientific community we all
shudder at the Cancer statistics. Even
after decades of time, billions of dollars
and, sadly, billions of mutilated animals,

we are not close to winning the war
against cancer.

‘ You can just bet if there were a great
profit in alternatives to animals in re-
search, they would have been perfected
long ago. It IS much more profitable to
cheapen animal life.

More t ged
forv1c10us-dog laws

ome folks in California, you may have
noticed, are joining the ever-increasing
Mr group of people who are trying to do
something about controlling vicious dogs
" —- in particular, pit bulls.

Good for them. I hope they keep at it.

Under a measure passed in Los Angeles last
week in the wake of several recent attacks by pit
bulls, the city will be able to immediately impound
a dog that bites a person. After a hearing, the city
may destroy that dog.

“Nobody on this council wants to treat animals
inhumanely,” said council member Joe Wachs.
“This is a reasonable law.”

As far as I’m concerned, the law could have been
stronger and put specific restrictions on pit bulls
and pit bull owners. A pit bull bite is not like a
poodle bite.

But laws singling out pit bulls usually wind up
ﬂoating around in the courts. The way around that
appears to be by enacting a vicious dog ordinance,
which has happened in several dozen communities
recently. Broward adopted a vicious dog ordinance
two months ago. ’

The animal rights groups in Los Angeles,
predictably, are already complaining that the
ordinance impinges on the rights of dog owners.

When it comes to things like pit bulls and other
vicious dogs, I am more concerned with the rights
of us human typw.

Broward attempt failed

The Broward County Commission, you may
recall, took a shot at enacting a pit bull ordinance
a couple of years back."

The commission passed the ordinance after
several people were bitten by pit bulls. The
ordinance basically required pit bull owners to
keep dogs in enclosed areas or muzzled and leashed
at all times.

‘ And it required $1 million worth of liability
insurance, later lowered to $100,000.

That sounds reasonable to me, considering the
risks many pit bulls pose. - ' .

Pit bull owners, of course, complained. Not only _,
were their cuddly p00psies just misunderstood pets,
they said, but also the liability insurance was
ridiculously expensive.

Of course the insurance is very expensive. That’s
because many pit bulls are very vicious. ,

 

 

* ' Anyway, the law got shot down for being -

discriminatory against pit bulls, and “vague.”
Rick Collord, director of Broward Animal
Control Division at the time, said that people

usually have no problem identifying those dogs.

“I think people who own pit bulls know what

. they are,” Collord said, “and I’m certain we could
‘ train our people to identify the breed or the breeds

that are involved under this law.”

'Pit bulls like none other

According to the Humane Society, seven of the

‘ 13 fatalities attributed to dog attacks last year

involved pit bulls. There have been five such

deaths this year.

Some towns are banning pit bulls. In Kalamazoo,

- Mich, county-animal control workers filed a union

grievance Seeking permission to carry handguns to
protect themselves from pit bulls. It has come to
that. '

“The problem with the pit bull is the nature of
the bite,” said Larry Atwell, acting director of the
Broward Animal Control Division.

“When they bite, they lock their jaws and cling.
There’s more muscle damage done, as opposed to
an animal that bites and lets go and bites again.

“I’ve seen a pit bull clamp down on another
animal. I saw him hit in the head with a board, and
it didn’t even faze him.”

Many pit bull owners are still going to complain
that. they and their dogs are being discriminated
against.

Such is life. As I said, I prefer people’s rights to
animal rights when it comes to vicious dogs.

If it takes a vicious dog ordinance to do the job
right now, OK. But it is hoped, someday, more of
those specific pit bull ordinances will be upheld in
court. ‘

Wynay Hayes said she has never visited
Dachau or Auschwitz but she has seen a con-
centration camp - for dogs.

One chilly afternoon in November, ,, Mrs.
Hayes was led beyond the double. doors Of Bo-
bette Phillips’ barn in Lawrenceville. Mrs.
Hayes, a Pendergrass, Ga., dog breeder, had
known Mrs. Phillips for about four years, but
she had never seen her breeding Operation.

.‘“It almost knocked me out, the stench
was. so bad,” said Mrs. Hayes, who first met
Mrs. Phillips while shopping for a cocker
spaniel for her 2-year-old daughter.

_ In the barn, she said, there were three.

‘ mals. .

cials.

On Monday, Michael Thomas
Southwick, 19, was arrested by

common,” said Phyllis Wright, vice
president for companion animals for
the Humane Society of the United

' NO statistics exist to indicate
whether cases of cruelty to animals
are growing. But anecdotal evidence

Although a nationwide problem,
animal advocates say cruelty to ani-
mals, including notorious puppy
mills, is more prevalent in the
South and Midwest.

In the South, an attitude pre-
vails that owners have a right to do
with their animals, their property,
as they wish, said Mrs. Wright.

In the Midwest, land is cheaper
and many desperate chicken farm-
ers have converted their Operations

budget to hire three inspectors to
enforce the new law.

Also, many people are reluctant
to report people who abuse or ne-
glect animals.

“It’s about as common as spouse
abuse, but a lot of it goes unreport-

and forgotten by the courts and offi-
‘ cials, some say.

Neighbors had tried for years to
get officials to shut down the, Phil-
lipses’ undercover kennel, according
to Mrs. Miller, the Gwinnett assis-
tant district attorney.

In 1981, a Gwinnett Magistrate
Court judge cited the couple for ille-
gally operating a kennel in a resi-
dential neighborhood.

“The frustrating thing with us

,was when we complained to the
county health department, they told
us it was not in their jurisdiction,”
recalled M.H. Pittman, a former
neighbor of the Phillipses.

“When we went to zoning, they
referred us to the business license
department. We kept going in cir-
cles.” '

In July 1985, Gwinnett County
Recorder’s Court Judge Rob Roda-
tus fined the Phillipses $75, set a
six-month probation senteace and
ordered them to cease their busi-
ness.

A probation officer never in-

spected the Phillipses’ home to en-

sure their compliance with the 2
judge’s order, Mrs. Miller said.
Shortly after Rodatus’ order, the ,
couple fled with their dogs to Spal- '

ding County, where they reopened
their underground kennel, according
to court records.

The day after the six-month pro- "

bation period was over, they packed

_ their base and . leaded a $116k with 7

dogs and moved back to Lawrence

' ville, leaving some dogs in Griffin ,
without food or water for days, ac- ‘7

cording to evidence presented in the
' April trial before Gwinnett Superior
Court Judge Bryant Huff.

Even after their arrest in De- '

cember, the Phillipses continued to
Operate their unlicensed kennel busi-
ness, according to evidence present-
ed in court.

“They showed an incredible dis-
regard for the law,” said Mrs. Mill-
er, the prosecutor in the case.

Although the Lawrenceville cou-
ple pleaded guilty to avoid a pro-
longed trial, they continued to pro-
claim their innocence outside the
courtroom, insisting that they “love
dogs.”

Mrs. Phi ips to three years in pris-
on and life on probation for 111
counts of cruelty to animals, operat-

ing as an unlicensed pet dealer and '

kennel, and felony obstruction of a
police officer. Phillips was sen-
tenced to two years in prison with
lifetime probation.

The couple also was ordered to
pay $16,505 each to cover the costs '
of feeding, boarding and medically
treating the dogs seized in the raid. .;
The Phillipses are. being. held. tori

In Aﬁril, the judge sentenced '

Gwinnett County at the Putnam .
County Jail. ;

The Phillipses’ sentences are be- .
lieved to be the most severe handed .

down in such a case in Georgia,’
._ _ ,,_ ._ 1,; . A .... 4.. . ,. i‘

9 Mrs. Miller said.

In sentencing the couple, the
judge said, “If you weren’t in this
business for profit, then the alterna-

‘tive would be that you were in the

business of being sadistic to the ani-
mals.” -

' The couple’s undercover breed-
ing farm operated in a Lawrence-
ville subdivision under the name Bo-
bette’s Kennel and ads appeared in
' Dog World, an international publica-
tion for canine lovers, and in Atlan-
ta-area newspapers.

The couple sold hundreds of i

purebred dogs such as schnauzers

and poodles for between $200 and ,

$1,000 each. “Bobette bragged that

she made $6,000 one Christmas,” ‘

Mrs. Hayes said.

In the barn behind their brick
home, the couple bred older dogs,
which often lived in filthy conditions
with little food, water or veterinary
care, according to evidence from
the trial.

When buyers came to the house,
Mrs. Phillips would bring out a cute
puppy and usually refuse to show
the offspring’s parents. Born .to
aged, sick, mange- and disease-rid-

den parents, the puppies frequently

died within a few days, Mrs. Miller
sald“I’ve been ridiculed for turning
them in. Pe0ple have said it was
none of my business, that they [the
Phillipses] were just out of food or

they didn’t have enough money,” '
' said Mrs. Hayes. -

Manhattan Brewing
Using Horse Sense

(Continued from page 1 7)

CHICAGO—How does a small, regional
brewery with a minimal marketing budget
get as much attention for its brands as An—
heuser-Busch Inc. gets for Budweiser? You
get a team of horses.

The pair of English Shires that pulls the
Manhattan Brewing Co.’s beer wagon
through the streets of New York City “is
the strongest support for our brands,” says
Peter Hall, Manhattan Brewing’s vp/mar-
keting director.

Like most regional beer marketers, the
two-year-old brewery situated in Manhat-
tan’s SoHo neighborhood depends heavily
on word—of—mouth endorsements to pro-
mote its beer.

The brewery provides p-o-p displays
once the beer makes it into a store or res-
tadrant, but getting space on the shelf or
on tap in bars can be nearly impossible if
the retailer has never heard of it, Hall says.

Enter Duke and Prince, two Shires dis-
tantly related to Anheuser-Busch’s famous
Clydesdales. When a new tavern or restau-
rant signs up one of the brewery’s brands
(Manhattan Amber, Manhattan City Light,
Manhattan Special Porter and Manhattan
Gold), Duke and Prince make the ﬁrst de-
livery.

At the recent opening of a new Food Em-
porium in New York, Manhattan Brewing
had the horses pull the wagon ﬁlled with six
packs to the store for a special promotion.

The horses attract customers to the
store—much appreciated by the store
manager—and Manhattan Brewing se-

cured a permanent place for its beers on
that grocery chain’s shelves.

“We have to rely on our ability to stretch
our promotional dollars as far we can,”
Hall says.

Regional beers such as the brands Man-
hattan brews are growing as a segment at
a double—digit rate compared to the total
beer market, which grew only 2% in 1986.

Despite the gain, regional breweries
barely contribute 1% to the total 185 mil-

lion barrels of beer produced in the US.
Manhattan is just now starting to build
trade for its ﬁrst bottled beer, Manhattan
Gold. In time, Hall claims, the brewery
may add a light beer to its line. '
The brewery does not disclose its annual
sales, but a spookesperson says it expects

' to sell 10,000 barrels of its keg beer in

1987, and 100,000 cases of Manhattan

, Gold in its first year of production.

So far, Manhattan brewery has gotten
all of its business from New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut. While it is eying
expanded distribution, the brewery also‘is
leery of it. “With growth, you can lose
some of the perception” that draws con«
sumers to a regional brand, Hall says. “Of
course, if someone asks for our beer, we’ll
try to get it to them.” —-Fran Brock

Monkey Plays Nabisco’s Top Banana

 

By Debbie Seaman

 

~ -VH ‘ '. ..

"Beau" steals the show in a futile search for his or.

NEW YORK—DFS/Dorland copywriter
Dick Holt and art director Scot Carouge
were staring at a whole line of Nabisco
Fruit Newtons—Blueberry, Strawberry,
Apple and Grape, as well as the famous
Fig Newton—e—and trying to ﬁgure out a
way to advertise them all in one 30-sec0nd
spot. Amazingly, the first part of the solu—
tion came rather quickly: The team started
joking about the flavors the line extension
did not include. Holt remembers musing,
“They don’t have kiwi; they don’t have
guava; they don’t have banana. . . ”

That was .it. Holt and Carouge recalled
the song, Yes! We Have No Bananas,
written in the 1920s and made famous by
Billy Jones in late 1923. It was a natural,
although the twosome briefly wondered if
the song would be recognized by younger
people. Yet, as senior vp/creative director
Fred Massin pointed out, “Who doesn’t
know Yankee Doodle Dandy? There are
certain songs that ﬁnd their way into the
vernacular.”

Holt, a self-confessed show tune fan,
went hunting for a recording of the song
in record stores all over New York. He ﬁ-
nally found a version on a Mitch Miller re-
cord in an obscure, little shop. In the origi-
nal Bananas, Holt said, the lyrics include
references to tomatoes and potatoes, and
he and Carouge knew they could substi-
tute their non-banana Fruit Newton fla-

vors in those portions of the tune.

The DF S Dorland legal department had
ascertained that, yes, there would be no
problem in securing

 

 

singers break into an old—fashioned rendi—
tion of Yes, We Have No Bananas, mak—
ing bananas singular. (The music was ar-
ranged by Mark Gray, with DFS
Dorland’s Barbara Tager as track produc-
er. Singers, including voiceover Dean,
were Richard Boukos, Steve Clayon and
Murray Weinstock.) -

The chimp, as he watches people eatin
different flavors of the cookies, shows
emotions ranging from sadness to dismay
to downright disgust. In a series of scenes,
edited by Alan Eisenberg of Hem/Eisen—
berg editing house, he shakes his head,
covers his eyes and hurls boxes of Fruit
Newtons away when he fails to ﬁnd the
only flavor he wants. He ﬁnally waves his
hand in a gesture of dismissal—as the Na-
bisco logo pops up in the corner of the
screen—and walks dejectedly down a dirt
road.

With Janet Pangborn as agency produc-
er, the creative team hired British director
Bob Bierman of Elite Films in New York
to shoot the spot in California’s Malibu
Canyon Park. The chimp, named Beau,
was supplied by Steve Martin’s Working
Wildlife in Acton, Calif. “A chimp is al-
most not an animal but like a naughty lit-
tle boy,” Massin said. While most who
meet animal talent merely pat the crea—
tures on the head, Massin found himself
astounded that he was shaking hands in
this case. ’

Holt and Massin said they learned more
about chimps than they’d bargained for.
They found, for example, that wearing
hats or shoes irritated the animals and
that they get very cranky after the age of

about 9 or 10. (Luck—

are less attentive to

explained.

As it turned out, Holt and Carouge had
created a rough layout for a print ad that
used the headline, “Yes, We Have No Ba-
nana” with the face of a disgruntled chim-
panzee as the visual. “Logically, theoreti-
cally, we have all these flavors that would
make everybody happy,” Massin said.
“The only one who’d be unhappy would be
the chimp. That picture is as strong as
that track.” He added that the chimp and
the song added the element of fun the
team wanted in the Fruit Newtons adver-
tising.

In the ﬁnished commercial, Camping, a
chimp drops in (literally, in one scene) on a
group of campers picnicking on Fruit
Newtons. Voiceover Bill Dean says, “Fruit
Newtons sadly announces . . . ” With that,

 

was highly trained,
responsive and friendly. For the last shot,
the DFS Dorland team asked one of his
three trainers how they could make Beau
look disgusted as he walked away. The
trainer suggested that the chimp throw a
pebble. On film, the pebble isn’t visible,
but the chimp looks as if he’s just said,
“Phooey!” (Beau’s throw was overhand;
most chimps naturally have an underhand
or side-armed pitch.) '

The agency was delighted with the high
level of recall when the spot was tested
with consumers. “Everybody remembered
the idea of a line of fruit cookies, whether
they took away the song or remembered
the monkey,” Holt said.

And, no, neither Holt nor Massin knows
what they will do if Nabisco decides to
make a Banana Newton.

3RD DISTRICT, New YORK APPROPRIATIONS

WHIP AT LARGE

July 9, 1987
Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough
3149 King Arthur Court, N.E.
Atlanta, Georgia 30345

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for your recent letter concerning the Tongass Timber Reform
Act (H.R. 1516f. I appreciate your support for H.R. 1516.

I strongly believe that Congress must re—evaluate its policy with
regard to the timber industry in southeast Alaska. Certainly, when
Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
(ANIDCA) in 1980, it had no intention of maintaining a timber industry
that was unprofitable. The Forest Service is losing more than $50
million a year on this investment, and in this time of serious efforts
to reduce the deficit, I don't think this is a policy the Forest
Service should maintain.

At the same time, the Forest Service continues to offer timber for sale
for which there are no buyers, and is building roads throughout the
Tongass--roads that cost millions every year and are obviously not
needed to maintain the industry. And, as you are aware, the Tongass
shelters some of the last significant stands of Northern Hemisphere
virgin rain forest, making it a truly precious natural resource.

H.R. 1516 amends the Alaska Lands Act to bring the permanent
appropriation that the Forest Service automatically receives eaCh year
for Tongass, at least $40 million each year, under the annual Forest
Service appropriations process. The Forest Service should not only be
directly accountable for how it spends taxpayer dollars based on its
management policy in the Tongass, but it should cease building roads
that lead to nowhere.

You will be happy to know that the House Interior Subcommittee on
Energy and the Environment just held two days of hearings on H.R. 1516.

 




Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough -— Page 2

At the hearings, many groups endorsed the bill including The Wilderness
Society, Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, National Taxpayers
Union, American Forestry Association, Southeast Alaska Conservation
Council, United Fisherman of Alaska and a number of other national and
southeast Alaska groups. H.R. 1516 has attracted 70 co—sponsors, and
enjoys strong support from Interior Chairman Udall.

It is one of my greatest priorities in the 100th Congress to put an end
to the wanton environmental destruction and financial waste taking

place in Alaska. Again, thank you for writing, and thank you for your
support. .

Gourmet foods
give pets taste
of the good life

By JIM TALLEY
of the Fort Lauderdale News & Sun-Sentinel

“There was a time when a scoop from a big bag of
dry animal feed — perhaps supplemented by table
scraps — was good enough for most pets.

But like the food many people are buying for them-
selves these days, pet food has gone gourmet — and pet
owners increasingly are treating their dogs and cats to
an upscale menu.

“Gourmet pet foods are an offshoot of your own life
style,” said John Harlow, a national account manager
for Chicago-based Selling Area Marketing Inc., a mar-
ket research firm. -

“Do you eat Haagen Dam ice cream, give the dog
leftover spaghetti, and feel guilty? No, you figure he
should eat as well as you do," he said.

Indeed, gourmet pet foods with improved nutrition-
al formulas are selling big »

Whether it's canned dog food processed into the
bites shaped like pork chops or more palatable cat food
packed in convenient, single-serving sizes, the products
are being marketed to pet owners of all ages with an
eye for quality rather than low prices. Highly profitable
for manufacturers and introduced only a few years ago,
such products now make up 25 to 30 percent of the
more than $5 billion pet food market — and no slow-
down is in sight, Harlow said.

“Premium pet foods are the dominant factor in the
market, and yen see the same phenomenon with dry
foods as wet: the gravy, chewy morsel concept,” he
said.

The change has come about in part because of the
way people perceive their pets more as family mem-
bers than animals, experts said.

"When the dog is like a family member and the
family is eating well, they say maybe we’d better buy
the dog something good, too,” said Roger W. Spencer, a
food analyst with Paine Webber in Chicago.

It is hardly just Yuppies who are spending the mon-
ey. "It would be a mistake to credit only young urban
professionals for this trend," said Ron Bottrell, a Quak-
er Oats spokesman, who adds that elderly people are
just as likely to spare no expense on their pets.

Paine Webber’s Spencer agrees. "A lot of empty-
nesters adopt dogs instead of children.”

Aware of people’s perception of their pets, manufac-
turers are targeting consumers with improved pet food
formulas that offer better nutrition, taste -— and plenty
of eye appeal to pet owners.

Quaker Oats’ latest offering, for example, is a
canned dog food called Tender Chops, with morsels
shaped like little pork chops. And the company’s televi-
sion commercials for Tender Chunks - Tender Chops’
precursor —— show a pair of hands carefully slicing
each chunk as if it were tenderloin.

Upscaling pet food calls for taking other directions
as well. Carnation’s TV spots for its Fancy Feast cat
food, for example, show a white Persian cat sampling
the stuff from a crystal bowl.

And Gaines' Cycle dog food is sold in different nutri-

tional formulas, for puppies, old dogs and fat dogs,

alike.

“With a lot of these pet foods, the way they look is
more for the owner’s sake than the animal’s,” said Gale
Cmrnecki-Mauldin, an assistant professor of animal sci-
ence at the University of Illinois, one of only two agri-
cultural colleges nationwide that do research on pet
nutrition. .

“Gourmet brands are usually more digestible, and
most of the brands on the market are nutritionally ade-
quate, but the average pet is overfed if anything," she
said.

Perhaps so, but many pet owners appear unlikelv to

Pets are considered members of the family - and they eat like it.

start cutting back on Fido’s new-and-improved dinner,
which — like human food —- increasingly is being pack-
aged in singleserving containers so there are no smelly
leftovers.

And with gourmet pet food products costing about
50 percent more, on average, than more commonplace
fare, manufacturers are delighted at the boost their
sales gives pet food profit margins, which are already
high compared with food-industry norms.

Ralston Purina sports a pretax profit of about 20
percent, and the pet food industry earns at least 10
percent, Spencer said.

“Twenty-five years ago, premium quality in pet food
was not the big issue, and it was marketed on price," he
said.

Now with the trend reversed, pet-food manufactur-
ers are willing to spend large sums to promote their
new products.

Carnation bolstered its advertising outlay by nearly
60 percent, to almost $7 million, in 1985 to pitch its
Fancy Feast cat food, while Quaker spent $30 million to
introduce Kibbles ’n’ Bits 'n’ Gravy Bits, according to
Advertising Age.

Meanwhile, the number of cats is growing faster
than the number of dogs. And given the tremendous
dollar value of the fragmented pet-food market, it isn’t
surprising that companies allot multimillion-dollar ad
budgets for gourmet cat food, the fastest growing pet-
food sector, experts said.

The cat population nationwide has increased to
about 50 million in 1985, the latest figures available
from the Pet Food Institute, a‘ Washington, DC. trade
group, from 37 million in 1980. The number of dogs has
increased to about 49 million in 1985 from about 46
million in 1980.

“Gaining a 1 percent share of a $5 billion market is
worth $50 million, and you can’t avoid spending on
advertising in a business where you have to create de-
mand): Spencer said, adding that more gourmet pet
foods are sure to appear in grocery stores.

He said, "There will always be new products: Look
at all the breakfast cereal variety, and yet companies
bring. out more every year.”

Even so, experts said a relatively'stable economy
over the past few years has helped make demand for
gourmet pet food as strong as it is. Such a level of
interest may shrink with the nation’s next deep eco-
nomic downturn, but many industry observers doubt it.

Said Harlow: “When the dog dies, he may not be
replaced, but he’ll eat good while he’s around."

PIT BULLS, from Page 3A

THE STORY is the same at shelters -

across the state, and the Humane Soci-
ety of the United States, in Washing-
ton, urges shelters not to put the
animals up for adoption.

“The main purpose (of the society)
is to place good pets into a loving
' home,” said Randy Lockwood, an ani-
mal behaviorist with the national soCi-
ety. “That becomes a problem on two
counts: pit bulls of unknown origins
(and) people seeking them for all the
wrong reasons, either fighting or hav-
ing a mean dog.”

Valerie Grimes, executive director
of the Humane Society of Southwest-
ern Michigan in Berrien County, said
some owners have turned in pit bulls
because they can’t afford liability in-
surance for them, and Al Kuiper, direc-
tor of the county’s Animal Control
Center, said pit bulls taken to his
shelter are killed immediately, in part
because the center is worried about its
own liability.

' “People will sue you at the drop of a
hat,” he said.

LOCKWOOD DESPAIRS of the
new breed of pit bull terrier owners.

' “What we are seeing on an increas-
ing basis is a change away from the
backwoods organized dogfights to an
intracity impromptu dog fight, involv-
ing a younger element, youth gangs
and things like that,” he said.

“People who are involved in dog
fighting are often involved in illegal
weapons, drugs and other crimes,” he
said. “We are getting more calls from
law enforcement officials who are
finding that rather than being faced
with a shotgun, they are being faced
with a pit bull. .. .

Agriculture, cottle interest groups
to seek funding for protection

8 John Dou hert
7¥he Y

Phoenix azette
Arizona’s agriculture and cattle
interest groups plan to ask the
Legislature to boost funding for a
predator control program.

The program protects livestock
and crops from damage caused by
coyotes, ravens and mountain lions.

The Animal Damage Control
Advisory Committee has been

K ‘ formed to gather data on predation

damage on Arizona’s farms and

aranches, Sandy Naughton, a

spokeswoman for the Arizona Cat-
tlemen’s Association, said.
Naughton said information will
'be turned over to the US. Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Animal Dam-
age Control agency~ and to the
Legislature. ,

“The main goal of this committee

. is to increase the cooperative fund-
‘- ing for the (animal damage control)

program within Arizona by present-
ing actual figures to the state
Legislature for approval of fund-
ing,” a recent Arizona CattIe Grow-

" ers Association newsletter states.
The cattlemen, the Arizona Wool.

Growers Association and the Ari-
zona Farm Bureau Federation are

members of the advisory commit-
tee. '

Andy Kurtz, executive secretary

E. of the Farm Bureau, said damage
; on crops from predators has never
7 been accurately measured.

The survey is intended to meas- ‘

ure such damage as chewed-up

_ emitter lines on drip irrigation

systems caused by coyotes in search
of water, and loss of melons to
rodents and coyotes. .

The move drew immediate criti-
crsm from environmental groups.

Steve Johnson, southwest repre-
sentative of Defenders of Wildlife,
said information gathered by the
commodity groups 'will be self-serv-
ing. “It is in each of these groups’
and the agency’s interest to inflate
thefigures,” he said.

M
The ravens
reportedly kill
calves by poking
their eyes out and
harassing the
animals until
they bleed to

death.

 

Darrel Juve, Arizona director for
Animal Damage Control, said the
federal government wants the state
to increase its funding to $365,900.
per year from $75,000. This would
match the funds spent by the
federal government, he said.

The Animal Damage Control
agency uses lethal and nonlethal
methods to reduce damage to crops
and livestock.

Juve said his agency does not
have accurate data on the amount
of predation occurring in the state.
The survey by the advisory commit-
tee will help compile more informa-
tion, he said.

Last winter, ADC came under
fire from Johnson and members of
the Audobon Society for its efforts
to control ravens that reportedly
were killing calves on two northern
Arizona ranches.

At the request of ranchers, ADC
set up poison bait traps in an effort
to stop ravens from striking cattle.
The ravens reportedly kill calves by
poking their eyes out and harassing
the animals until they bleed to
death.

Juve said the Fly M Ranch near ;
Flagstaff reported 16 calves were f
killed by ravens last winter. ADC ,_

confirmed one calf died as a result ‘

of a raven attack, he said.

Estimates of the cost of the
program to control the ravens were
has available, he said.

 




Leghold
traps:
Vicious
devices . . .

Ann K Iosowski is the president
of the Michigan Coalition for Ani-
mals, which has initiated a cam-
paign to prohibit the use of steel-
jaw leghold traps in Michigan.

 

By ANN KLOSOWSKI

SINCE Sewell Newhouse invented
the steel-jaw leghold trap in 1823, this
type of trap has been to blame for the
maiming and/or death of billions of
animals. Yet, of all the traps available,
the steel-jaw leghold trap is still fa-
vored by most
“ trappers. Eighty-
seven percent of
the wild pelts pur-
5 chased by the fur

‘ with steel-jaw

animal steps forward to take the bait,
the jaws slam shut on its paw. The trap

. gles to free itself, the tighter the jaws

 

 

 

 

grip. .
Experts have testified that an ani- '

.mal caught in a steel-jaw leghold trap
suffers pain similar to that which a
human experiences when a car door is
. slammed on his hand. It is fairly com-
, mon for an animal to chew off its own
limb in a frenzy to escape from the
agonizing pain inflicted by the trap.
This is known as a “wring-off.” Some-
times, a trapped animal will bite franti-
‘cally on the trap itself , thereby sustain-
ing severe and painful injuries such as
broken teeth.
' In addition to the cruelty they infliCt
on target turbearing animals, leghold
traps pose a serious threat to non-
target animals, birds and reptiles.
Some estimates say that as many as 60

 

 

 

 

The trap rarely kills outright; instead it cripples and imprisons its
victim until the trapper returns. The more the animal struggles to
free itself, the tighter the jaws grip.

 

percent of all animals trapped are non~
target animals — “trash” to trappers
who have no use for them. The “trash”
may include endangered species and
domestic dogs and cats. When a trap-
per sets a leghold trap, he can never be
certain of what it will catch. A trap is
just as likely to spring on a collie as on a
raccoon, on a Siamese cat as on an
opossum. '

The following are but a few of many
documented cases of domestic animals’

0 The Fort Wayne (1nd.) Humane So-
ciety reported that in just eight weeks
it received four dogs and two cats
caught in leghold traps. All six animals
had to be destroyed. .

At the University of Minnesota,
combined data from two 1979 studies
of animal trapping showed that of 360
trapped pets studied, 112 had chewed
off part of their limbs to escape. Legs
had to be amputated on 31 percent of
these animals, and eight percent had to

encounters with steel-jaw leghold
traps: .

O In Inuisiana, a cat was found in a
trap chained to a tree. Because of
recent heavy rains, the trap was too
rusty to be opened to release the cat, so
the cat was destroyed.

0 In Ann Arbor, a dog with a trap that
had been on her paw for at least a week
was found trying to nurse a litter of
puppies she had whelped while in the
trap. Her injuries were so severe that
her leg had to be amputated and her

, puppies destroyed.

O In Georgia, a cat was found with a
leghold trap on her head. It had been on
the cat for so long that the cat’s skin
had begun to grow around it. The cat
had to be destroyed.

be destroyed. Other studies have
shown that 40 percent of animals
caught in steel-jaw leghold traps are
permanently crippled.

STEEL-MW leghold traps are ex-
acting a devastating toll on wildlife. It
is doubly tragic that they are also
claiming innocent pets as victims.

Trapping is a leisure activity for
most trappers in this country. Accord-
ing to the U.S. Department of Com-
merce, the majority of licensed trap-
pers in the United States are under 18
years of age. “Sport” trappers are the
ones most likely to lose interest in their
hobby and to tail to return to check
their traps, leaving many animals to
suffer and die.

Most states have regulations man-

dating how frequently trappers must
check their traps. Regulations vary
from every 24 hours, to 48 hours, to 72
hours, to once a week in Nevada.
Michigan has no trap check require.
ment whatsoever. Many animals are
left imprisoned in the vise-like jaws of
leghold traps for days. Some perish '
from shock, loss of blood, exposure. ‘
Some, sitting targets, are killed by
predators.

Michigan does not have any laws
governing how trapped animals must ,
be killed. Common methods of dis-
patching the animals are by bludgeon-
ing with an ax handle or club, or by
standing on an animal’s chest and 3
yanking on the legs to rupture its heart
and/or lungs. Non-target or “trash”
animals are often cut up and used for r
bait when the traps are reset.

Steel-jaw leghold traps are prohib-
ited in 63 countries. Their use is banned
in Rhode island, New Jersey and Flori-
da. Humane alternative traps exist that
are just as effective. far more selective
and far less cruel.

The United States has long been
labeled a nation of compassionate ani-
mal lovers. If we are indeed such a
nation, then we must prove it by
refusing to Allow steel-jaw leghold
traps to torture and kill animals,
whether domestic or wild, indiscrimi-
nately.

. . . for conservation, necessary tools

 

Thomas L. Washington is the

United Conservation Clubs.

 

By THOMAS L. WASHINGTON
TRAPPING has inCreasingly be-
come the subjeCt of heated and emo-
tional controversy. Of partiCular con-
cern is the leghold trap, often called the
steel! ~1aw trap in anti-trapping litera-
ture.
Trapping is an
,_ integral part of
‘ our North Ameri-
can heritage. "Na-
tive Americans
and early Europe-
an settlers used
trapping as a
means of survival,
especially in the
North. Commer-
Washmgton gan in North
America in the early 1600s. Since then,
the activity has changed greatly. In
1823, Sewell Newhouse revolutionized
trapping with his perfection of the
leghold trap. Today’s leghold trap,
contrary to popular belief, does not
contain jagged steel teeth.

TRAPPING MEANS different

things to different people. For some, it
is a form of recreation. For others, the
extra inCome can be important. To the
farmer, rancher or orchardist, trapping
can mean the difference between mak-
ing a profit or suffering a loss. For
instance, beavers Cause flooding; foxes
and weasels raid hen and turkey
houses; bobCats, wolves and coyotes
kill livestoCk; raCooons steal stored
grain; rabbits and porcupines girdle
fruit trees, and muskrats and nutria
riddle dams and dikes. Many of those
problems Can be controlled by trap-
pmg-
_ Wildlife management Combines
many of the sciences with management
techniques to provide and protect habi-
tat. Without adequate habitat, animals
will not have food, water and Cover.
Wildlife management also involves
wildlife population management. This
may require complete protection when
members of certain speCies are deplet-
ed, or it may involve harvesting species
that are abundant or threatened with
overpopulation. A properly managed
wildlife resource is healthy, productive
and in balanCe with the surrounding
environment (at carrying CapaCity).

The thinning out of populations of
furbearing animals has for years been
accomplished by trapping. This is be-
cause wildlife biologists and wildlife
administrators recognize that regulat-

ed trapping is the most efficient and

 

It the numbers taken by hunting or trapping
are reduced, then more animals will die of

other causes.

 

practical means of reducing surplus
populations of many species while per-
mitting man to use the surplus.

THE QUESTION is often raised as
to whether trapping is humane. The

'laws of nature diCtate that only a

percentage of eaCh species will survive
a given year. What many people do not
realize is that for some wildlife species
only 20 perCent survive the entire year.
This 20 perCent is the breeding stoCk
for the following year.

There are a number of reasons why
so few survive each year: predation,
disease, aCCidents, starvation and de-

hydration. If the numbers taken by.

hunting or trapping are reduced, then
more animals will die of other Causes. It
then becomes a question not of how
many will die but of how they will die.
It is the attitude of the Michigan United
Conservation Clubs (MUCC) that man
should be allowed to make use of this
resource — rather than letting it be
wasted through aCCidents, starvation,
disease and dehydration.

Animal predators usually kill quick-
ly. However, many predators will eat
the hindquarters of a deer or the breast
of a bird'while the deer or bird is in fact
still alive. Instead of the comparatively
swift death of a trapped animal that is

_ dispatched by a trapper, diseased or

starving animals die slow deaths, often
taking weeks or months.

A trapper has three basic types of
traps — live traps, kill traps and
leghold traps. Live traps are costly and
mostly ineffective. Kill traps are quick
and humane, but they can kill non-
target species that could be released
from leghold traps.

THE RESPONSIBLE trapper con-
forms with all regulations imposed on
this activity. This ensures a healthy
population of furbearing species. The
trapper also purchases a liCense, which ‘
pays to protect the furbearers’ habitat. ,
This money also goes for research to .
develop more humane methods of har- ‘
vesting furbearing animals. Every '
trapper is selective in his choice of
traps and the teChnique he uses to
pursue a particular speCies. Ethical
trappers respect the rights of landown-
ers, Check traps frequently, leave an
adequate number of animals for the
future and support conservation offi-
cers in the prosecution of wildlife law
violators.

The MUCC feels that the question of ;
whether or not an individual should‘
trap is his own. All individuals interest-
ed in the conservation movement,
whether consumptive or non-con-
sumptive users of wildlife, are after the
same thing — the Conservation of
wildlife. Wildlife conservation is ac-
complished by the protection and en-
hancement of wildlife habitat.

of pit-bull ﬁghting

Betting pools run $500,000, security as tight as summit meeting

By Knight-Ridder News Service
SAN JOSE, Calif. — With betting
pools that run as high as $500,000
and security precautions that rival
visits by heads of state, the under~
ground world of pit-bull fighting is
as secretive as it is bloody. ,
Thousands of people are in
volved in the “sport” in California
and elsewhere, but the network is
so secretive that officers some-
times spend months just trying to
infiltrate the operations, Say inves-
tigators with the Humane Society.
It was only after his arrest that
Michael Patrick Berry of Morgan
Hill, Calif ., was identified by police
as a major figure in the under.
ground world of illegal dogfighting.
' One of Berry‘s four pit bulls killed
2yé-year-old James Soto. Berry has
been charged with involuntary
manslaughter and keeping a mis-
chievous animal.
“A year—long undercover intelli-
gence-gathering investigation
came up with more than 144 names
of people involved in a major way
in California,” said Eric Sakach,
an investigator with the Humane
Society of the United States who
works in the West Coast regional
office in Sacramento. Humane So-
ff'ciety investigators have peace-offi-
ifcer powers and can make arrests.
Humane Society officials say in-
formation is so scarce and infiltra-
Etion is so difficult that there have
'been no raids on substantial ‘dog-
fighting operations in Santa Clara
County in at least seven years.

“The only way we really get in-
formation is from the inside,” said
Warren Brodrick, director of the
Santa Clara Valley Humane Soci-
ety. ' ‘

Fans shuttled to pit

- Lured as much by the chance to
win thousands on a good bet as by
the blood of a good fight, pit-bull
fight fans are a loyal bunch who
think nothing of observing secret
codes and being driven in caravans
to a fight. ‘
Typically, for a major fight,
small groups of fans are shuttled
past several checkpoints to a ham
or other site where the dogs are
fought in a “pit.” The fight itself is

called combat and can last as long ,

More common to metropolitan
areas are what experts call “street
fighters.”

“They are often juveniles or
gang members," Sakach said.
“The dogs they’re using often only
resemble pit bulls and are often ob-.
tained through a shelter or pound
with poor. screening."

, In addition to those they classify

. as street fighters, authorities refer

to “hobbyists” and “serious” dog
fighters. . ’
Sakach said most people think of
serious dog fighters when they
hear about the activity.
“They take great pride in breed-

l ing, training and fighting the dogs

they breed,” Sakach said. Unlike
. hobbyists, who are most interested
in making money on the bets they
place but often don’t bother to con-
dition their dogs, serious dog fight-
ers breed champion fighters worth
thousands of dollars. Some animals

can command as much as $600 stud _

fees for a guaranteed breeding,
Sakach said.

1 Outcry over pit bulls at fever pitCh'fi

By the Los Angeies Times

LOS ANGELES -- Concern over
attacks by pit bulls — extremely
muscular, aggressive dogs origi-
nally bred in England to fight other
animals -" has reached unprece-
dented levels even though there is
no hard evidence the dog attacks
more frequently than other dogs.

There are no reliable national
statistics on dog bites by breed.
- However, becauseof the power
of its jaw, which can exert more

- than twice the pressure of a Ger-

man shepherd or a Doberman pin-
scher, and the fact that it hates to

when it strikes.

Since mid-1983, pit bulls have
been responsible for 20 of the 28
dog-bite-related deaths in the na-
tion, including all five that have oc-
curred this year, according to the
Humane Society of the United
States. Fourteen of the 20 pit bull

victims were 6 or younger.

Animal control experts and

. breeders believe that many of the

pit bull attacks are due to a sky-
rocketing number of poorly bred
and badly trained dogs raised by
backyard breeders. The breeders
are trying to cash in on the pit

for as many as two-thirds of the
700,000 to 1 million pit bulls in the
United States, according to vary.
ing estimates.

The latest wave of pit-bull panic
began June 13 in Morgan Hill,
Calif., 20 miles south of San Jose,

. where a chained pit bull guarding a

marijuana crop fatally mauled a
2%-year-old boy who wandered
within the animal’s reach. The
dog’s owner was charged with
murder.

 

Earlier this week, a pit bull
raced out of a duplex in northeast
Los Angeles and attacked a city _
animal-control officer who had
come to investigate a complaint
that the dog had hit a young girl
and her father the night before.

The attack, filmed by a televi-

sion crew that was preparing a re-

port on pit bulls and broadcast na-
tionally, left the officer with a
crushed hand and puncture wounds
to her chest, requiring surgery.

A dog described as part pit bull
and part German shepherd attack-
ed a San Francisco woman and her
child Thursday, leaving the mother
in serious condition and the girl in
fair condition, officials said. -

The fatal Morgan Hill attack
stirred a reaction that shocked ani
mal activists.

By the middle of this week, two
dozen northern California pit bull
owners had brought their dogs to
shelters asking that the dogs be de-
stroyed, either because their neigh-
bors demanded it or because the

More than 30 cities have passed

hey call her the St. Francis
of Nassau Bay. She has
saved countless stray dogs
and cats and nursed sick squirrels
and birds back to health.

Whenever someone finds a sick
animal, they bring it to her. They
know Irene Welch won’t turn it
away.

She never hesitates to spend
money to make them well. She
once paid $400 for the repair of a
cat’s crushed foot and $300 for an-
other cat’s cataract surgery.

Welch, 72, a retired data entry
clerk who’s lived in Nassau Bay
since 1970, has loved animals for
as long as she can remember. Since
childhood, she has taken strays into
her house. As usual, her house in
Nassau Bay is filled'with some of
the strays she’s rescued. Lashes, a
mixed breed dog she rescued from
starvation, barks and wags his tail
as visitors approach. Colico, whose
foot was crushed when she was just
a kitten, gives a loud meow. Snow
White, a large white mixed breed
cat, slinks through the house.

“They all have a little story be-
hind them —-— an illness that made
me their friend,” Welch says as she
hugs Lashes. Mistreated, and cold,

Grief normal after pet's death

From COUNTRY LIVING Magazine ‘

 

he death of a pet often is like losing a member
of the family — and the mournersgo through

some of the same stages as when a beloved

person dies. - - ~

The trouble, according to an article in Country Liv-
ing magazine, is that society doesn’t accept the depth
of grief that accompanies the death of a dog or cat.

“I’ve found that owners grieve for their pets as in-
tensely as if a human companion had died, with one
complicating factor: It’s still not widely acceptable to
be upset by an animal’s death,” said Dr. Jamie Quack-
enbush of the University of Pennsylvania, who has
counseled hundreds of bereaved pet owners.

One reason the death of a pet is so painful lies in the
fact that the pet’s death has a profound effect on the
intimate rhythms of its owner’s life.

“Much more than the end of a life has occurred.
Your pet may have symbolized certain things to you
-- a companion, a reason for being, comfort, security.
Those may seem to disappear when he dies,” Quack-
enbush wrote in his book, When Your Pet Dies.

The difficulties of a pet’s death are multiplied by the
fact that there are no established customs to help over-
come grief —— there’s no funeral, no acceptable time of
_ mourning, no standard words of comfort for friends to
speak.

First, admit you have lost someone important and
irreplaceable. Grief deepens when it is unacknowl-
edged.

There are predictable stages of grief in pet loss, as
there are for humans, starting with disbelief. You can’t'
believe this is happening to your pet. Making final ar-
rangements for your pet may help you take in the fact
that-the animal is dead or dying.

You may want to bury your pet yourself, but before
doing so check with local officials to be sure it is legal.
There are about 500 US. pet cemeteries, used by
about 2 percent of pet owners. The Association of Pet
Cemeteries offers referrals to places that meet its re-

quirements. ‘

Many people arrange for disposal through their vet—
erinarians or local sanitation department. Cremation is
another alternative.

The second stage of grief is anger, often against the
veterinarian for not spotting a terminal disease in its
early stages. There is also anger at the pet for leaving
you. Guilt is common among people who euthanize a
suffering pet, even if the decision was an act of mercy.

To ease the pain, get rid of your pet’s food dish, bed
and toys. Alter your routines so you won’t be remind-
ed of your pet. . .

Most important, talk about what you’re going
through. ’_

It’s especially important to share your feelings with '
other members of your family, particularly children
who may be confronting the reality of death for the
first time. a

Gentlemen:

I understand there is legislation aimed at increasing the
authority of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture to enforce the
Animal Welfare Act, which was introduced in the House by
Representative Toby Roth of Wisconsin.

HR 241 would allow the USDA to obtain restraining orders or
injunctions against animal dealers, carriers, exhibitors,
and handlers charged with violations of the Act.

I am in full agreement with this Act, and hope it will be
adopted and implemented immediately. However, I would also
hope it would include the Department's authority to inspect
on a regular basis, stockyards around the country. Had this
been the case, I am sure the horrifying story of the downed
cow in the Milwaukee slaughterhouse would never have occurred.

It is bad enough to eat these creatures, but our treatment of
them before they are slaughtered, and in the stockyards leaves
much to be desired. I have already sent you a copy of the
story of this pitiful animal which had both legs-broken, and‘
was left to suffer for many hours before being mercifUlly dis—
patched. Man's cruelty to his fellow creatures seems to know
no bounds, and were it not for the Animal Rights activists,
these stories would never come to the public's attention. It
seems the newspapers are certainly lacking when it comes to re-
porting the abuses and misuses of animals, but they delight in
digging up dirt on public figures.

The Animal welfare.Act should be strongly enforced at all times.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Dearer. Brown:

Hooray for Jennifer Graham - the young lady with a heart full of
compassion and feeling for another living creature - in this case
the frog she refused to dissect.

She should get a medal. It's too bad all of our youngsters do not
have the same feeling of compassion. I'm sorry I did not do the
same thing in High School. I was also forced to take a biology
course for which I had absolutely no use then, nor any time since.
However, fortunately, we did not have to dissect live creatures.
Ours were already dead - having been killed by someone else. How-
ever, in a modern, progresSive society, as we like to think oure
selves, this cutting up live animals, or cutting into them, should
be a thing of the past. There are far too many satisfactory models
of all life available for this type of study.

I call upon you, and the teaching profession as a whole, to stop
this dissecting and cutting of live creatures in the name of science
progress or whatever you choose to call it.

,

What we truly need in all our levels of school, is a course on the
humane treatment of all life. There are far too many recorded cases
of criminals who in their childhood, mistreated animals.

Obviously, children are not receiving humane education in their
homes unless they are fortunate enough to have caring parents and
pets they are properly taught to care for.

This young lady should not receive a lower grade or a failing grade
because she refuses to be cruel, and I trust your school will see
that steps are taken to rectify this situation.

Dear Pat:

I anW'I have written numerous times asking that our National
Parks, Wildlife Refuges and National Scenic Riverways be pro-
tected from hunting or trapping. I have stated also what the
word ”refuge” means - and it certainly does not mean killing or
trapping animals.

NOW I see that Rep. Bill Emerson of Missouri is still trying to
get his bill passed to allow trapping in the Ozarks National
Scenic Riverways, which is a unit of our National Park system.

Does this gentleman not understand the meaning of Refuge, or what

our National Parks are for? They are certainly not for the killers
of animals. They are so all Americans can enjoy the wildlife
therein.

I care not one whit what the National Rife Assn. wants, and I know
of thousands of other Americans who are pretty well fed up on what
the NRA wants. I have said many times I do not understand their

hold on Cdngress, but it seems to be a strong one. I am reasonably
sure that the jobs of you gentlemen do not depend on the NRA, and you
might be surprised to find out you might garner a lot more votes if
,you paid less attention to them and what they want. ‘

I am asking Pat, that you send this letter to the House Subcommittee
on National Parks and Public Lands to which this HR 138 has been re-
ferred. I understand the Park service has banned trapping based on

its legal responsibility to protect wildlife, that the federal court
upheld this decision, and no amount of study will make trapping ac—

ceptable in this National Park Service area.

Thank you.

Canada

Dear Mr. Prime Mﬁnister:

It is with sadness and disappointment that I read Canada has or
will resume the killing of the baby seals, or young seals in
your splendid country.

My husband and I have traveled extensively in western Canada.
We love it and go back year after year because of its beauty
and the friendliness of its people. I would hate to have to
give up our trips because of this sad situation.

Man does not need fUr, and I gather from a good friend in Tor-

onto that the majority of Canadians do not want this killing to
continue. I know it goes against the humanity of all those who
love animals. If the men and women who persist in wearing the

skins of dead animals knew how ugly they truly appear to a civ-
ilized.world, I think they would soon stop. Wearing fur shows

an arrogance and utter disregard for the lives of the other
creatures which share this planet with the human creature.

I know that Europe will no longer accept the sealskins from your
country, and I further understand there are stockpiles of these
skins now being held in warehouses in Canada. I have a feeling
a deal has been worked out with Japan, another country which
shows its complete disregard for the lives of animals by its
continued killing of the whales. I hope this is not true. I
hope Canada will show itself to be truly civilized and that it
'will immediately stop this wholesale destruction of seals.

Thank you.

Gentlemen:

It constantly amazes me hDW'the "voice of the people” in America is
so frequently ignored by the powers that be. I think our judicial
members, our Supreme? Court, and sometimes, our Congress, forget they
are employees of the people, and they have been put in places of
authority to carry out the will of the people.

The fate of the unfortunate primates taken from the infamous Edward
Taub of Silver Spring, MD is a case in point. The overwhelming num-
ber of appeals for these animals to be sent to Primarily for Primates
in Texas, and the overwhelming number of members of Congress who re-
quested the same thing, should have been enough to see that this was
done. But I understand NIH practically thumbed their nose at both of
these requests.

Now I also understand there is a bill in the House, H.R. 1770 (the
"Standing Bill" which proposes granting legal standing to groups and
individuals to sue the U.S. Dept. of.Agriculture for enforcement of
the Act. I fully support this, and I hope you Pat will become a co-
sponsor of this Bill. Someone has got to be responsible for the way
other creatures on this planet are treated, and it is obviously not
going‘to be those who don't give a damn about animals.

Just keep in mind that the Animal Rights movement is in its infancy,
and it is not going to die or fade slowly away. It is growing stronger
year by year, and if we have the right kind of laws to protect the
rights of animals, we will have no more break-ins of laboratories or
other places where animals are inhumanely treated.

Please let me have a reply to this letter and thank you.

Sincerely,

CMrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Members of Congress from GA
Washington, DC

Gentlemen:

It's too bad that the president has so little interest in the
National Forest, Parks and Refuges of this country that he

would appoint someone like Donald Hodel to be Secretary of the
Interior. But I am not really surprised because the president
has only shown an interest in the welfare of the cattlemen and
sheep raisers and of course, the oil industry, since he has been
in office.

Perhaps some day the people of America will wake up and elect a
man or woman who loves this country and its natural assets, and
will do his/her best to see that they are protected for future
generations.

This man Hodel apparently doesnlt care at all what the American
people want. I haVe a feeling all of you and other members of
Congress have received tons of letters against drilling for oil,
or for anything else in Alaska's Denali National Park. His disre—
gard for discontinuing flights into the Grand Canyon and dune
buggies on Cape Cod show he is a man who has no business being
Secretary of the Interior.

The last paragraph of the enclosed column by Harold Scarlett
shows Hodel's complete lack of concern for animals and our Na-
tional treasures.

It is time Congress took a stand against this man.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough
Encl.

 




HOUSTON POST - June 28, 1987'

, flhterior's Hodel: a James Watt

During the summer vacation months of
1987, a record 122 million people are ex-
pected to visit the nation’s national parks.
By year’s end, attendance is expected to
total 292 million. That’s a lot of people
“pressure.

Since its creation in 1916, however, the

National Park Service has remained re—
markably free of political pressure. The
park service, a branch of the Interior De-
partment, has been run by professionals.
' But over the past few months the politi—
cians, headed by Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel, have been in a running battle with
the professionals, headed by park service
director William Penn Mott Jr., over the
future of the national park system.

Reflecting Reagan administration poli-
cies, Hodel is going all—out for develop-

ment in and around the national parks —-

oil exploration and logging around the
boundaries of Yellowstone, more conces-
sions in the parks, continuing ﬂights into
the Grand Canyon, dune buggies on Cape
- -Cod, fplacer mining for gold in Alaska's
f’" Denali. '

One environmental leader snorts with
disgust that Interior under Hodel is treating
the national parks like “government—run
Coney Islands.”

Hodel was one of the assistants to the
irascible James Watt. Since Hodel got
Watt’s old job early in 1985, he has quietly
resurrected Watt’s discredited policies and
has been carrying them out without bom-
hast and with little public scrutiny.

“Hodel is a Watt clone in a three-piece
suit,” as one senior park official put it.

The venerable Mott, 77, is a parks pro-
fessional who probably would have been
chased from office long before now except
for one thing — he has close personal ties
to President Reagan. Mott ran the Califor-
nia state parks when Reagan was governor.

Team player Mott endured continuing
snubs and setbacks in silence until late last
year.

Then Hodel’s assistant secretary for
parks and wildlife, William Horn, broke an
earlier agreement and overruled virtually
every proposal. in a major reorganization
plan drawn up by Mott.

 

H amid .3 _ ;

Horn proposed a plan of his own that
would get rid of some senior park profes-
sionals who had fought development pro-
posals. They would be replaced with politi-
cal pets, such as a former lobbyist for the
National Rifle Association.

Horn also revised Mott’s performance
evaluation of senior park executives,
downgrading most of them without even
consulting Mott.

Mott finally blew his stack and, in a _
memo to Horn later made public, protested. 3
bitterly that the assistant secretary’s actions
were “incomprehensible.” , ,

He pointed out that Horn’s plan would
take money and manpower away from the

{Clone in 3—piece suit.

' parks themselves and. cost an extra

$875,000 a year for needless new bureau- -

1. cratic jobs in Washington.

Horn was finally. called to account by
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chairman of a
Senate appropriations subcommittee. Byrd
3 rebuked Horn for not submitting his reor-
ganization plan to Congress as required,
and accused him of running a “covert op-
eration.”

One thing that particularly irked Byrd
was Horn’s plan to remove the parks poli-
cy-making office from Mott’s control. The
Senate majority leader put a rider in an
appropriations bill that blocked Horn’s
paychecks until he agreed to return the
- park policy office to Mott. -

. In another policy clash, senior park offi-
c1als met in Washington last August to put
the finishing touches on a report recom-
mending curbs on noisy sightseeing flights
below the Grand Canyon’s rim.

Hodel, as it turned out, was meeting at
‘ thejrsame moment with helicopter and air
Sightseeing operators. He took their word

that the park service report was rife with
errors and, without even reading it himself,
upbraided the park service professionals
for their “unprofessional” performance.

As Pulitzer Prize-Winning reporter Rob-
ert Cahn has pointed out, Hodel and Horn
have frequently suggested the park service
is “interested in protecting the parks from
people instead of for people.”

Mott and others believe Hodel and Horn
have never read or understood the 1916 ,.
act which created the park service. It di-
rected the service to conserve the natural
beauty and wildlife of the parks so they
could be enjoyed, but in ways that “will f
leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment
of future generations.”

liodel devastatingly exposed his parks "
philosophy in talking with a reporter about

the use of snowmobiles in Yellowstone.

Deer and bear “are used to these noisy,
smelly snowmobiles,” Hodel said. it’s
those pesky cross-country skiers gliding si-
lently across the snowﬁrhe said, that really
give wildlife a fright. 3
