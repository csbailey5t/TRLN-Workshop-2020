3,030,000 bounty put 1

on nosy drug dogs

By Jerry Needham
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

Along the South Texas border, man’s best friend
is a drug smuggler’s worst enemy.

Drug trafﬁckers have offered $30,000 to anyone
who kills either Rocky or Barco “The Narco,” caus—
ing U.S. Border Patrol agents to place their two
dogs under 24-hour guard, an ofﬁcial said Thurs-
day.

The two Belgian Malinois dogs have sniffed out
more than $130 million worth of _ drugs in South
Texas in 11 months. Such success has angered
smugglers coming to the United States from'Mexi»
co, ofﬁcials said.

Word of the bounty on the dogs, described as
friendly and medium-sized, came from an infor-
mant, said Jerry Hicks, deputy chief of patrol for
the McAllen area.

“It was a simple offer of $30,000 for the death of
one of our dogs,” Hicks said. “It reportedly came
from one of the organized smuggling rings. We’re
taking it very seriously. We’re protecting the dogs
and the handlers. The animal is a very valuable
piece of government property,” he said, adding that
it costs $6,000 to train each dog.

But the short-haired dogs, excellent herders that
are hard to see at night because of their coloring,

: are worth the expense.
Hicks said.

r “You get an iii-wheeler com-
ing through with a load of cab-

‘ lbage and it would take hours and
hours for us to 5881 ch it,” he avid.
f‘But with a forklift and a dog, in
three or four n‘iinutes the animal
*Wlll check the whole load out.”
" The dogs have found drugs
hidden in loads of cabbage and
;onions, in furniture and empty
beer cans, he said, adding that
nothing seems to throw them off
the scent. .

”They‘re so sensitive, they cair-
pick up the scent from one mari-
juana seed,” Hicks said.

The dogs, he said, are trained
by a San Antonio company to re-
iact to four odors —- humans,
jn'iarijuaris, cocaine and heroin.

to get through for several years,”
he said.

“Now, all of a sudden, we’re
hitting them right in the pocket
and they would love to get rid of
those dogs,”

If drug lords are serious about
killing the animals, they are bark—
ing up the wrong tree. Hicks said
when agents got wind of the
$30,000 offer, they beefed up
precautions with added personnel
and electronic surveillance equip-
ment.

He speculated the hit men
might try to poison the animals or
even shoot them.

Due to tightened supervision,
Rocky and Barco won’t be sitting
ducks, but they are literally the
sitting dogs of their profession.

“They were trained for passive
response,” Hicks said. Instead of
pointing or barking when they’ve
sniffed out drugs, Hicks said, they
just sit down.

 

The dogs are so docile they are
popular with youngsters in
schools, where they are used in
drug education programs and
have their pictures posted.

Hicks said the breed is ex-
tremely intelligent, with a better
sense of smell than the standard
German shepherd.

Their work comes cheap, too.

How are Rocky and Barco told
what good dogs they are after
they have made a hit?

“Their reward is a rubber ball
they get to play with when they
alert. The dog handler carries it in
a pouch on his belt," Hicks said.

These are the sector’s first
sniffer dogs. Because of their
“phenomenal” success, Hicks ex-
pects at least eight more dogs to
be added to his sector.

He said the Laredo sector uses
two sniffer dogs and soon they
will be common along the entire
United States-Mexican border.

Inmates Learn
About Patience

as They Tame '
Wild Mustangs

By PENELOPE McMILLAN,
Times Staff Writer

'SUSANVILLE, Calif—The men, sitting on the
corral fence, passed a tin of Bugler tobacco back
and forth, rolling their own cigarettes as they
called out words of encouragement to the tall, thin
man in the small arena below. '

“Easy, homeboy,” one said softly as 27-year-old

John Roth tried to calm the glassy-eyed horse
flaring its nostrils and twitching its black tail.

The morning wind blew cold, but Roth and the
men paid no more attention to it than to the
garbled sounds carried from the public address
system inside the prison walls not far away.

Roth and the other inmates from the California
Correctional Center at Susanville concentrated on
. the little mustang they called Suzie Q, which only
' a few weeks before had been running wild in
Nevada.

lst Such Program in State ' °

As part of an agreement between state
correctional officials and the federal Bureau of
Land Management, which by law manages the
nation’s wildvhorses, Roth and 16 other prisoners
work to tame mustangs. The program at the
medium-security Susanville prison, started seven
months ago, is the first of its kind in the state,
although similar programs exist in Colorado and
New Mexico. '

Government officials hope such training will

ﬁhusual because the mustang tends
if) be much smaller than a domestic
horse. And unlike the slick, roman-
tic Wild West image usually asso-
Ciated with mustangs, Suzie Q is
ugly. Instead of a smooth coat, her
gr stuck out in tufts, like an old
mg. But Roth treated her as if she
ﬁere beautiful.
.945 The horses are taken from public
ranges in 10 Western states out of
the government’s belief, contested
by wild horse advocates, that there
are too many mustangs. Protected
by the 1971 federal Wild Free-
Reaming Horse and Burro Act,
mustangs now number an estimat-
ed 43,286. The BLM says they
compete for scarce food and water
with other wildlife, as well as with
more than 4 million cattle and
sheep whose owners pay the gov-
ernment about $1.54 a month per
animal for grazing rights on public
lands. Plans call for another 10,000
horses to be rounded up this year.
Unless people adopt the captured
horses, they spend the rest of their
lives in federal holding pens, offi-
cials say. Animal protection groups
worry that they also face possible
slaughter, since BLM has recently
asked permission from Congress
for the right to sell unwanted
horses in bulk to people who could
then resell them for meat. .
The prison training has emerged,
many say, as the one largely
uncontroversial “aspect of BLM’s
wild horse program. In Susanville,
federal agents bring the horses to a
fenced five-acre section, contain-
ing corrals, hitching posts, an arena
and small wooden shack, just out-
side the prison gates. BLM pays the
insdlcatcare d feed

help make its current crop of 8,000 captured horses

more “marketable” to the general public. Even

though the horses only cost $125 to adopt, a fifth of

the animals captured over the last three years
have had no takers.

 

“A person who might adopt a horse would be
more likely to if it were easily handled, and less
likely if it strikes out and runs away from you,”
said Lorin Slegemilch, the BLM assistant district
manager in Susanville, in northeastern California.

While the program was conceived to help the
horses, prison officials note that it has had ,
unexpected positive effects on the inmates because
the men have to learn that success depends more
on patience than aggression.

Roth, in prison for assault with a deadly weapon, ‘
had been assigned to Suzie Q two weeks before. '
The former fence installer from Saugus spoke in
low tones to calm the mare, and stroked her neck.

She was tiny, the size of a wooden carrousel

horse. According to BLM officials,this is not

 

Slegemilch said, which are the
same as if the horses were housed
at BLM corrals.

The prison pays the salary of a
professional trainer, Tom Chenovw
eth, 35, to teach both the men and
the horses, and has added horse
training to its list of daily inmate
activities—along with welding,
kitchen and clerical jobs.

The men, who have committed
crimes ranging from drug traffick-
ing to murder, earn as little as 12
cents an hour, which they can use
to buy items, such as tobacco, at the
prison store. The horses, after two
weeks to a month in Susanville, are
trucked to one of a series of BLM
public adoption sales, such as one
next month in Fresno.

So far, 78 mustangs have gone
through the Susanville training
program and 59 have been adopted.

“Confidence is the hardest thing
to gain in these animals,” said
Chenoweth, a plain-spoken man
who gives the impression that he
would rather be working with the
horses than talking about them.

He assigns each horse to one
man, he said, so the horse can
develop some trust in a human.
"There’s not a mean one out here.
They’re all scared,” he said. Of
course the men are scared, too, at
first, he added, because they tend
to come from urban areas and have
little experience with horses. So
far, he said, no one has been hurt.

Sometimes when Chenoweth
talks, it is hard to tell whether he is
speaking of horses or men. As a
trainer, he believes in establishing
dominance, he said, but disap-

 

 

 

 




proves of doing so through cow-
boy-style manhandling.

“I preach patience,” he said.

. “You treat them with respect,”
he continued in the next breath, but
now, it turned out, he was speaking
of the inmates. “Physical aggres-
siveness is the worst thing you can
do,” he continued. “If you’re ag-
gressive with an inmate you’ll end
up with your hands full. I call them
‘sir,’ I say ‘would you do this,’ and
‘thank you.’ They respond to that.”

The training progresses one step
at a time, he said, for both man and
horse. Before the prisoners handle
the mustangs, they learn tasks
such as leading, cleaning or sad-
dling on a fat old domestic horse
named Leon, which lives perma-
nently at the prison corral. “Ev-
erybody has to go through him
first,” Chenoweth said.

'For the wild horses, the first step
is to accept man’s touch, he noted.
After a halter is put on their heads,
their first lesson ends as soon as
they let themselves be petted. The
second time, this is repeated, and
the lesson again ends as soon as
they accept the affection, which is
meant to show that man means
them no harm. The men are taught
to “make the right thing easy,”
Chenoweth said, and wait it out
instead of using force.

After that, Chenoweth said, “We
keep building. . . . We start lead.
ing the horse, coaxing the horse to
follow. Each day it depends where
the horse is at, and each day we go
a little further.”

Roth, who had little to do with
horses before joining the program
four months ago, found that Suzie Q
had progressed unusually fast in
two weeks, and now had even
accepted a saddle.

On this morning, with Chenow-
eth’s permission, Roth decided to
try to ride. When he felt she was
quiet, Roth pushed himself into the
saddle. But with two jumps and a
kick, Suzie Q bucked him back to
the ground, and then ran wildly
about the arena.

When Roth stood up, though, the
mare ran back to him. She stopped
in front of him, with her ears
forward. He petted her.

BLM and prison officials in Su- .
sanville and elsewhere said they 3
have been equally pleased with the
effect of the program on both horse
and man. The first prison-horse

program started at the Colorado
State Penitentiary in Canon City in
August, 1986, BLM spokesmen
said, and all 500 horses that have

gone through it have been adopted. ‘

But the improvement in inmate
behavior, Warden Benny Johnson

lnmate John Roth carries saddle into corral for what will become a short ride. Wayne Folder,

in Canon City noted, “was a by-
product none of us expected.” The
prison made no attempt to place
quieter or gentler prisoners in the
program, he said. “We had a lot of
inmates who showed aggressive~

ness, physically, verbally, ‘anti’

 

personalities. Within two weeks
you could see a slight change in
them. They became more apt to
talk to you, they would take an
interest in the horse, an interest in
going to work. Our management
problems started to drop. . . . It
was very interesting.”

In California, too, men are not
chosen for personality, officials
said. The criterion has been their
security risk, since the inmates
work outside the walls and guards
patrol the area only periodically.
Chenoweth carries a two-way ra-
dio, in case he needs help, but said
he has not had any problems.

“It’s really amazing the patience
they display,” said Art Calderon

’ ‘-

 

 

aSSistant superintendent at the
§,500-inmate Susanville prison.
Some of these guys have not
displayed a lot of patience with
themselves, and that’s why they
find themselves in institutions.”

“Sometimes I feel like hitting
one,” admitted inmate Bob Miller,
44, standing next to a gray mare
named Smokey, who was following
him around without a lead rope.
“.But you just spend a little bit of
time, and they’ll do it for you.”

He was in jail for burglary for the
seventh time and had a bad temper,
he said. But now he has a job offer
to work on a horse ranch in
Modesto when he’s released in
July, he added, and hoped to “stay
out. I’m learning something this
time. I never learned a trade.”

“I’ve got her like a puppy dog,”
he said, rubbing Smokey’s face.
“She’ll be great for a kid.”

This horse would be leaving for
an adoption sale next week. Would
he miss her, he was asked? Miller
thought a moment, then shrugged.

”You get a little attached,” he
said, “but they’re going to some-
where better.”

After 15 anxious minutes, Doyle finally

Doyle began with wild birds through the
Phoenix Bird Rehabilitation Center, c0-
founded in 1979 by Doyle and George and
Breck Stewart.

Raptors — eagles, falcons, hawks, owls and
Other birds of prey — are among the m05t
dramatic birds. and the most threatened. Doyle
was dismayed by the number of raptors injured
by gun shocs that came to Phoenix volunteers.
With traditional medical treatment, the birds
could never ﬂy free again. So Doyle, who
specializes in microsurgery and the
reconsrruCtion of human hands, decided to
adapt his sophisticated surgeries.

“Microsurgery had never been used on
birds," he says. “There was nor even a suitable
anatomy tethook. We literally invented
techniques as we went along.” His firSt major
sticcess was USA, a bald eagle near death from

a gunshor wound. Doyle operated on her in
1979, and after two years of intensive

. rehabilitation. she was released.

As his expertise grew, Doyle operated on
red-tailed hawks. song birds. barn owls -- on
everything from a pelican with a broken leg to
a hummingbird with a broken wing. Nearly all
the injuries come from man, either directly —
gun shots, automobile accidents or traps —— or
indireCtly — pesucides, frayed power lines,
windows and skylights.

Doyle — who Still maintains one operating
room jusr for birds in his professional office --
has taught many veterinarians the surgical
techniques he developed. 50 the docror. who
has had a lifelong intereSt in wildlife, has
taken his work a Step further. “It quickly
became apparent that we could help
endangered species m05t efficiently by
reintroducing healthy young birds to the
wild.” he says. And the breeding program was
born.

The non-proﬁt, family-run operation,
which has no ties to the Phoenix organization,
is housed at a Zl/z-acre compound in Arlington.
All five Doyle children, now grown, have done
everything from clean cages to remove talons

from their father’s ﬂesh. One daughter, Teri,
assiSts during surgeries and in caring for the
birds that live in the three large barns built. by
her father. Doyle and his wife, Terry, vacation
separately so that one of them is always
available for the birds. The Doyles personally
spend $30,000 to $40,000 a year on the
breeding program and accept no donations.
So why does Doyle do it? “Wildlife is an

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR - March 11, 1988

hese engaging, yet fragile mammals have become a symbol of eﬂorts to

save wildlife worldwide; Chinese

researchers 111 remote reserves are trying to help them, along with

By Marcia Bliss Marks

Special to The Christian Science Monitor
Peking
KEPT hearing hoofbeats

under my head - back and ‘

forth, back and forth. It

was not yet dawn and we

were stretched out on bed-

ding on the second ﬂoor of

an abandoned farmhouse.

The night had been a

restless one— a long, futile

. watch at the window,

then to bed, only to be awakened by Xiao

Wei, a graduate student doing ﬁeld re-

search, to glimpse the shadowy bulk of

one takin after another emerging from the

forest to lick salt and romp in a mud
puddle.

I got to the window just in time to see
two huge creatures exiting from the ﬂoor
beneath us, where they had been looking
for more salt The second of the two
' stopped, and slowly, deliberately, turned
his head around. He stared, and then,
with immense dignity, snorted and moved
on again. His rump looked as broad as the
' proverbial barn door beneath me. It was
unimaginable that he could slip so silently
through the bamboo undergrowth.

Takin are a protected species related to
the musk ox, with moose-like faces,
shaggy coats, and thick curled- back
horns. They inhabit much of the same
environment as the giant panda, but be
cause they are vastly less appealing in
looks and somewhat less endangered,
they have not attracted the same world—
wide attention. In Sichuan Province’ 5
Tangiiahe Nature Reserve, however, thev
are under intense study.

lesser-known takin and golden monkeys?-

, 'I‘angjiahe, about 400 square kilome-
ters (150 square miles) of rugged moun-
tains, is one of a dozen or so nature re—
serves set up to protect the giant panda.

Of the three we visited in Sichuan, it was
the most uninhabited (by humans), and,
in mid-autumn with the turning leaves
stitching breathtaking brocades on the
slopes, the most beautiful.

Access roads built into two main val-
leys in 1965 and a small cluster of build—
ings, including accommodations for for-
eign scientists, were hand-me-downs
from logging days. Local inhabitants had
been successfully moved out since estab-
lishment as a reserve in 1978 (a feat not
yet managed at the other reserves we
visited, Wolong Nature Reserve and
J iuzhaigou Nature Reserve).

A birder’s paradise, Tangjiahe is also
home to a number of rare mammals, in-
cluding the giant panda, takin, and golden
monkey. Although we visited a ﬁeld re-
search station and climbed to higher ele-
vations, we never caught sight of the
elusive giant panda or golden monkey.

We did, however, come upon fresh
panda droppings, which a worker from
the ﬁeld station carefully put into plastic
bags for analysis, and saw where the
panda had been chewing on the bamboo.

In its over 3 million years of existence,
the giant panda, called a living fossil, has
evolved two specializations for eating
bamboo: forepaws adapted for grasping
stems through the addition of a sixth
digit, or thumb, and teeth that are broad
and ﬂat; EeIarushmg bamboo.

I ? ,,,_‘u“__‘~ _

UnfOrtunately, the panda s reuance on
an exclusive diet of bamboo has led to its

.- peril. The death of bamboo species and
" the destruction of habitat through logging

and agriculture have caused starvation
The panda’s low—quality diet forces it to
forage at intervals day and night, rest
much and, when active, concentrate on
keeping its stomach ﬁlled.

Reproduction is slow; pandas conceive
after 6% years and raise one cub every
two years. If two babies are born, the

mother raises only one.

Some scientists feel the panda has lost.

its sense of struggle and has become de-
; fenseless, without the adaptability
E needed to survive. They say the panda,

highly specialized and highly localized be-
cause of its choice of a single source of

; food, provides a living blueprint for ex-
; tinction. Thus, saving the panda has be-
E come a worldwide challenge.

The World Wildlife Fund (WW F) has

. taken this lovable creature as its repre-
; sentative. WWF has also pumped money
and expertise into China’s panda re—

serves. One of these is Wolong Nature
Reserve, 2,000 square kilometers (770
square miles), established in 1963.
Farming, logging, hunting, and live—
stock grazing had degraded the giant pan-
da’s habitat at Wolong. But in 1975 log-
ging was halted, and in 1980 a breeding
and research station was set up in c00per—
ation with WWF. ’Ibn pandas were in
residence at the time of our visit, includ~
ing the baby of them all, Lan Tian (Blue
Sky), the ﬁrst panda born at Wolong
through artiﬁcial insemination. He is nov.
a bouncy, tumbling, tame one-year-old.
The pandas live well, with house, play--
ground, and plenty of food. When Qiu

 




Xianmeng, their veterinarian, calls them
by name, they come.

Mr. Qiu took us to an area where year-
round ﬁeld research on the ecology of
giant pandas and other wildlife is carried
out. The mountain trail wound through
densely moss—draped evergreens and tall
rhododendron. The leaf-strewn path was
etched in white, the serenity of the sur~
roundings occasionally quickened by
gleaming red birches. Musk—deer drop-
pings and hoofprints were the only signs
of previous travelers. _

Midway, our guide got out his listening
apparatus to monitor the movements of
pandas wearing radio collars - two red
pandas and two giant pandas. We could
hear the tick-ticks, faster or slower, de—
pending on how active the animals were.
We could tell the direction, but we would
have a long, probably fruitless climb
through thick underth to ﬁnd any.
Red pandas, small raccoon—like creatures,
are notoriously elusive, and giant pandas
are nearly as hard to come upon.

We climbed to a tent used by the young
researchers for night observation. Gauges
marked precipitation levels, and our
guide carefully took notes —- as he had all
along the way - of birds sighted and, of

course, the condition of various species of ‘

bamboo. The giant pandas’s habitat was
indeed nearly inaccessible, yet beautiful.

Later that day we returned to reserve
headquarters. A drive alongside the rush-
ing, rock-ﬁlled Pitiao River to the re-
serve‘s high pass at Balangshan, 4,487
meters (14,717 feet) above sea-level,
showed how difﬁcult, if not-impossible, it
would be to clear the reserve of its more
than 3,000 local inhabitants. This was a
main truck and bus route cutting right

through the reserve’s center. The reserve ,

had built a power station to generate
electricity, and houses and a school on its
fringes, but residents refused to move.

The third major panda reserve we vis—
ited had a reputation as a tourist attrac-
tion rather than a serious research center.
Jiuzhaigou, covering 600 square kilome-
ters, was established in 1978 and is a
fantasy of water landscapes.

Our route there took us past team after
team of gold prospectors working the
river with huge hoses to dredge the sand,
' and gracious, fretworked, wooden houses
festooned with hanging clusters of corn.

Racks and trees were draped with
everything from beans to cabbage to per-
Simmons, all air-drying for winter con-
sumption. Pairs of oxen were plowing the
ﬁelds. The residents were dressed in tra-
ditional costume, the women in gowns of
rainbow colors, the men in belted swagger
coats, all topped off with ﬂat-brimmed
hats and tall, perky feathers.

The attraction of J iuzhaigou is its
abundance of water — broad waterfalls
and nearly continuous lakes. Particularly
incredible was sight of clumps of trees
an. ‘ ’ ' r J l * .“72’” " waters.

The lakes are very clear reﬂecting mir-
rors, kaleidoscopes of cobalt blues, emer-

. ald greens, and deep purples.

The reserve’s managers are entirely
engrossed in matters of tourism - from

clearing up litter to construction of a Ti-
betan-style guest house. Managing tour-
ists is, in a way, protecting wildlife. In-
deed, there seems to be progress along
that line; driving along the roads we en-
countered large ﬂocks of pheasants that
were in no hurry to disperse.
Jiuzhaigou’s extraordinary beauty,
like that of other once-remote areas, was
taken for granted by its inhabitants, who
didn’t realize its potential for tourism.
_ Only in recent years have such areas been
“discovered” and marked for develop-
ment. The Chinese have taken to travel
with a vengeance, and Jiuzhaigou has
become a must for all semiadventurers.
From Jiuzhaigou, we made our way
back to Chengdu, the provincial capital.
Our mission was to pay a visit to Mei Mei,
champion panda mother, at the Chengdu
Zoo. Six of Mei Mei’s offspring are still
living, and she is such a steady producer
that zoo ofﬁcials now take her cubs away
at about seven months so she can give
birth every year. (Normally the young
leave their mother at about 18 months.)
Mei Mei is one of more than 10 pandas

- at the zoo. Although they are well taken

care of and the 200’s reproduction pro-
gram is supported by WWF, it is disturb-
ing to see these Wild creatures so conﬁned
- more so even than at the Wolong re-
search station.

Watching Mei Mei, a smallish female, I
noticed her pigeon-toed gait. A zoo panda
expert explained that it helped her plow

through bamboo thickets as She foraged

i_ in the Wild.

1 was reminded once again of the
curious relationship between beast and
food source, still a mystery that is tied up
in the scientiﬁc guessing-game of whether
the giant panda is more closely related to
the raccoon or the bear. Such things are
for scientists to ponder, and the literature
on the subject has done little but exacer-
bate the controversy. Meanwhile, the
creature is the focus of intercontinental
conservation efforts and one of Sichuan’s

_ most precious inhabitants.

NEW YORK s— Researchers

FDA must list patients in/drug test

 

© 1 987, The Washington Post

WASHINGTON -— A congres—
sional subcommittee with pri-
mary responsibility for oversight
of the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration has or e lrst time
voted to subpoena agency records
that include names of patients.

'Re . Ted Weiss D-N.Y, chair—

man of the House Liman
resources subcommittee, said he

re&;mmend€d the action because '

the FDAhas refused to give Con-
gress complete records of recent
drug experiments.

“For 23 years now we have
been getting the information we
need from the FDA,” Weiss said.
“There has never been one single
instance in which any informa-
tion relating to a patient has been
disclosed. This is just an attempt
on‘the part of the Reagan admin-
istration to give us as little infor-
mation as possible.”

PuﬂLLHealth Service ofﬁcials
said it is their policy to keep
names associmed with clinical

drug trials conﬁdential. But FDA
sources acknowledged that they
haVe often fd‘rwarded to Hill
committees information with
names added.

Health Service officials said
the subpoena would scare people
out of participating in new-drug
trials. Widespread discrimination
has made conﬁdentiality a special
concern for AIDS patients on
experimental drugs, although
none of the records in dispute
involve drugs for AIDS treat-
ment. '

“We cannot count on this gov-
ernment not to leak information,
just because it is sensitive,” said
Lowell T. Harmispn, deputy
assistant secretary foLhealth.
“We would be willing to pro‘vide
everything except the names.”

Weiss, who has advocated

 

guarantees of conﬁdentiality for ‘

AIDS patients, said that the
Health and Human Services
Department is trying to use this
issue to mask a slow response to
his requests for information.

The General Accounting Ofﬁce
recently reported several
instances where the FDA was
unable to comply with requests
from Congress in a timely fash-
ion.

“In the past we would give
them records and we knew they
would not use the names in any
way,” said a senior FDA ofﬁcial.
‘fBut AIDS has brought the con-
cern over confidentiality to a
head. If patients using a new pain
reliever have their names
released, none will be fired or
harmed by the information. If
you say a person is on AZT and
he has AIDS, that’s completely
different.”

Weiss said that the subpoena,
for records 91' bad reactlons to
five rugs, would not be delivered
before Tuesday. The drugs are
lovastatin, used to lower choles-
téTSI; meretal, an
anti-depressant; tha, an Alz-
heimer’s drug; begged: a sedative
used before operations, and
swl, a painkiller.

Xavier gets
grant for
research

A Xavier University program
that helps introduce students to
research techniques has been
awarded a $2. 2 million grant by
the National Institutes of Health.

The grant is the fourth —— and
largest — awarded to the Minor-
.ity Biomedical Research Support
Program since it was started in
1972 as a way to bring the uni-
versity more federal research
money and to encourage minority
students to consider careers in
{scientific research. NIH’s Divi-
sion of Research Resources has
awarded Xavier $5.3 million. .
~ The four- -year grant will sup-
port seven research projects,
involving 17 students. Student

assistants for the projects are

selected on the basis of academic
performance and career goals.
Xavier has introduced more
than. 300 minority students to
research during the course of the
program. Two to four students
help each faculty member with a
project do research, earning a

TIM§5 fzcnYU ms-

maximum stipend of $3,600 a
year.

Cheryl Klein, assistant profes-
sor of chemistry and director 0f
the program, said Xavier submit-
ted 10 research projects for con-
sideration and seven were fin-
anced.

The projects are:
> Richard Ochillo, professor of
pharmacology, will continue a
study about the cause and treat-
ment of hypertension.
> Joseph Melcher, professor of
communication, will continue
research on the effects of sickle
cell disease on hearing.

SC1en tists generally believe the

with the nerve that carries feel-
ingE‘om a rat’s right hind leg into

ot of people are using a
complete transsection of the
spine. That’s been unsuccessful
for the last 100 e rs. My philos-
ophy is to start with something
simple and get more complex, ” he
said earlier this month.

Silver, a n wwnhst with a
doctorate in anatomy, was to
present his 111 mgs Monday to a
symposium at the Society for

.‘buroscienCe meeting here.

He sa1d he and his colleagues,
in‘cluding postdoctoral student
Gear e Smith and neurosurgeon
M C el -K j‘ot of Columbia Pres

began y cutting roots of the scia-
tic nerve.

utting the root just outside
the fifth vertebra has effects
much like those when ‘a‘ ruptured
spinal disc crushes that root of
the sciatic nerve, he said. Toes
can be moved but have no feeling.

“People with this problem limp
and their foot hangs down. They
have problems with their toes
gripping the ground and they fall.
They can’t wear high—heeled
shoes,” he said.

Silver saidthe rats’ sciatic
nerve roots were cut at the fourth

cytes were used to try to repair
damage at the fifth vertebra.

In embryos, astrocytes build
what S1lver described as high-
ways for the long fibers through
which information goes to and
from a nerve cell. But in adults,
he said, they build soar tissue
that blocks off damaged nerve
cells.

'Nobody knows why or how
that change occurs, he said.

He' said his research team
made bridges from a new porous
polymer coated with glia, the long
nerve ﬁbers, of astrocytes from

Houma lawyer on trial ' .
in NO. in drug killings

 

-By BILL GRADY

Staff writer

 

Two dead drug dealers, a mys-
terious Mexican gang, blood-
spattered eyeglasses and photo-
graphic blow—ups of a horrific
death scene are the sensational

elements of a Houma lawyer’s

,murder trial.

Gerald Bosworth, 43, is
accused of two counts of first-
degree murder in the September
1985 killings of two Houma area
reported drug pushers who at one
time were his close friends.

Bosworth, the former cam-
paign manager and lawyer. for ex-
Terrebonne Parish Sheriff Charl-
ton P.'Rozands, could receive the

' death penalty if found guilty of

the shooting death of David
Thomas III and of the shooting,
stabbing, .spearing and bludgeon-
ing murder of Joey Grifﬁn, 25.
The trial was transferred to
Orleans Parish Criminal District
Court because of the charismatic
BosWorth’s prominence in the
Houma area and the Sensational
aspects of the crimes. .
f 'Following his arrest in late

.September 1985, the stocky,

wiry-haired defendant spent 15
months in the Terrebonne Parish
jail before being released after
posting a $500,000 property
bond. The granting of bond of
any sort in a ﬁrst-degree murder
case is highly unusual, officials
said.

But circumstances of the case
itself are equally so. There are no
witnesses and no one who has
testified that Bosworth would
have been near either victim’s

home at the times of their deaths.
Each was killed in his home.
Defense attorney Robert Glass
said the pair was killed by a visit-
ing band of cocaine-crazed Mexi-
cans who had brought a shipment
of marijuana with them that they
expected Griffin and Thomas to
buy.

its case early Thursday, said
greed was Bosworth’s motive.
TerrebonneParish Assistant Dis-
trict Attorney Allen Helm said
Bosworth, who declared

bankruptcy in 1980, had been,

loaned thousands of dollars by
Thomas and Griffin. He killed
them because he wanted more,
Helm told the 12-member jury.

“This man is all appetite,” he
said. “He wants and he wants. He
has an insatiable appetite for
money.”

In the absence of witnesses,
bothsides have concentrated on
interpreting the evidence found
at the Grifﬁn murder scene.

The 6-foot-2 redhead was
found lying on his back against a
baseboard in his living room. He
had been shot four times in the
back and head, stabbed in the
gut, speared in the arm with a
splintered pool cue, and battered
with a’ blunt object. An attempt
had also been made to “pith” him
-— to pierce his spinal co‘riby
rammiﬁwa pick-type instrument
into the base of thﬂeck. ' T

All of the carnage was the work
of Bosworth, the state said.
Defense attorney Glass said Grif-
fin was pursued from room to
room by the Mexicans, who
administered a coup de grace by

 

 

The prosecution, which rested _

trying to pith him, a method of
killin often 5 'on animals in

foreig? countries.

r1 ﬁn died with his right hand
clenched in a fist. When investi—
gators pried it open, they found

three hairs which the state says
are Bosworth’s. '

A forensic expert has testified
he believes the hairs are indeed
the defendant’s and that they
were yanked out of his bushy
head of hair with force. Glass
maintained that the hairs stuck
to Grifﬁn’s bloody hand when he
fell on a rug under a pool table in
his den after he had been shot. It.
was natural for Bos‘worth’s hair
to be there, Glass said, because he
had shot p'ool'wnh his friend
many times.

And then there is the matter of
Bosworth’s blood-spattered
glasses, which were found on the
floor in the den. He’d forgotten
them there several days before
and they were knocked from a
chair and spattered during the
Mexicans’ attack, Glass said.
Prosecutors said the glasses were
on Bosworth’s face when the
dying and desperate Griffin

. reached up and pulled them off as f

the defendant 'bludgeoned him.

Thomas’ best friend testified
Thursday that days before his '
murder, Thomas told him that
he’d argued with his visiting
Mexican drug suppliers. “He '
thought he was going to have
trouble with the Mexicans,” Lon-
nie Price testified in Judge
Dennis Waldron’s court. “He said
he was going to lose them as con-
tacts.”

By DAVID ANSLEY
Knight-Ridder Newspapers

 

 

PITTSBURGH — The now-
banned drug “ecstasy” may find
a place in psychotherapy if a
Harvard psychiatrist wins his
fight to let scientists study the
drug.

In September, Dr. Lester
Grinspoon won a fedEFE'l—‘court
deem against the government
that would ease restrictions on
the drug. The Drug Enforcement
Administration a strictly
banned the drug in 1985 and has
not decided whether it will appeal
the September decision.

Grinspoon told a science con-
ference in Pittsbprgh on Tuesday
that the experiences of people
who have experimented with the
drug and psychiatrists who gave
it to their patients when it still
was legal convince him that it
has properties worth investigat-
mg.

It offers “a gentle invitation to
insight,” he said, reduces 5 per-
son’s anxieties and defensiveness
and makes it easier for them to
examine their own minds.

Grinspoon, 59, whghaistudied
the therapeutic uses ofinindaal-
terin m fo two de-
cades, took an interest in the
ﬁg, known scientifically by the
acronym MDMA, in 1982 after
students to im about it. he
said.

He tried it himself, with his
wife, one Saturday afternoon in
1984 and had “truly a remarkable
experience,” he said. “It’s a drug
of such interest that it really de-
manded a research program."

Now he is waiting to hear
whether the DEA will appeal the
case to the Supreme Court or
accept the court’s decision that
ecstasy had been classed as a
more dangerous drug than it
really is.

He said he doesn’t want it
widely available on the street,

however, since it apparently can
be fatal. He also said he doesn’t
have widespread backing from
psychiatrists.

But “I have yet to meet" a psy-
chiatrist who has personally used
MDMA “who doesn‘t believe
quite firmly that. this drug can
help him in his practice.”

MDMA was invented in 1914
by Merck g o. scientists looking
for an appetite suppressant. They
dropped their interest in the drug
when they discovered its mind-al—
tering side effects.

MDMA reportedly is readily
available on some college cam—
puses and costs about $10 per
capsule.

Pharmaceutical companies
have shown little interest in
studying MDMA, Grinspoon
said. because the formula is in
the public domain and no com-
pany would be able to recoup the
costs of studying it without own—
ing the patent.

who might be interested in
NIDMA study were thwarted in
1985 when the DEA imposed its
strictest limits. declaring MDMA
to be a "Schedule 1" drug. ()n the
government’s five-level list oi
:ontrolled drugs. “Schedule 1 is a
black hole." Grinspoon said.
That category is reserved for
cirugs that have a high potential
tor abuse. have no medical use
and can't be used safely under a
ioctor’s direction.

Heroin. LSD and marijuana
are on that list now.

Grinspoon appealed the DEA‘s
action to a federal appeals court.
He argued that. MDMA should be
assigned to “Schedule 3," which
still would outlaw most uses but
make it easier for researchers to
obtain the drug and learn how to
_;se it safely.

Dear Odette:

I wish to acknowledge and thank you for contacting
me to advise of your support of the Animal Patenting
Act (H.R. 3119), and the Rufugee Wildlife Protection
Act (H.R. 2724).

As you have noted, the Animal Patenting Act would
prohibit, for two years, the patenting of animals altered
through genetic engineering technology. The measure
is pending before the Subcommittee on Courts, Civil Liberties,
and the Administration of Justice of the House Judiciary
Committee but no action is scheduled at this time.

The Wildlife Protection Act would limit the killing
of wildlife in the National Wildlife Refugee System.
This measure has been referred to the House Merchant
Marine Committee but further action is uncertain at this
time. In any event, please be assured that I will keep
your well-expressed views in mind should these measures
be the subject of debate on the House Floor.

With all good wishes.

rug proves promising
ght against cancer

“'3‘9"W Dvoobﬂ. 17/2165 Frdﬂvuue’

 

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON -— National
. Institute of 'Health resea'r'EIiérs
hmmino acid cem-
pgugd that proved in laboratory
tests to be a powerful cancer
fighter and a “very, very promis-
ing” drug for treatment of
tumors.

Dr. H nda Kleinman of the
NIH_1n ethesda Md., said
Thursday that a peptide synthe-
sized in the laboratory was able
tB—fnevent the formation of lung
cancer tumors in laboratory rats
and in test tube experiments. “’

She said the peptide also has
been shown to be effective
against Kaposi’s sarcoma, a can-
cer that often strikes patients
with acquired immune deﬁciency
syndrome, or AIDS.

“We characterize it as very,
very promising,” Kleinman said
‘ of the compound. “Therehave
been other peptides described,
but this is the most potent one we
know of.”

A peptide is a compound made
up of amino acids. Proteins are

 

composed of chains of peptides.

Kleinman said the compound
used in the experiment, peptide-
11, seems to prevent cancer cells
from penetrating the walls of
blood vessels and invading an
organ.

“The cancer cell when it is
traveling in a blood vessel is
really in a sealed pipe,” she said.
In order to leave the vessel and

invade the cells of an organ, the

cancer cell must first penetrate
the vessel wall.

To bore through the vessel
wall, the cancer cell first attaches
itself to laminin, a basement
membrane that is part of the ves-
sel wall. When it is attached, the
cancer cell erodes the basement
membrane until it is able to move
through the vessel wall. -

Kleinman said peptide-11
appears to be able to prevent the
cancer cell from sticking to the
vessel wall and thus blocks the
cell from.boring through. This
strands the cancercell inside the
vessel, where it eventually will die
or be killed by the body’s immune

 

system. In this way, the cancer is
unable to spread. '

She said the peptide has been
shown in test tube experiments to
be very effective on Kaposi’s sare
coma. “It seems to block the
Kaposi cell activity,” she said.

Kaposi’s, once considered very
rare, has become a commonly
occurring cancer among AIDS
patients.

At this early period in studies
of the peptide, few side effects
have been identified, Kleinman
55$ ‘

“It disrupts the formation of
organs and tissues,” she said. “So
I would predict it will probably be
non-toxic in an adult, but it may
have some effects on pregnancy.”

Kleinman said a patent has
been applied for on the peptide
compound, but that it could take
many more years 0 a oratory

experiments before the new drug
is available for tests on human
cancer patients. if ’

Amrt on the study is pub-
lished in Friday’s issue of the

journal Science.

The Honorable Senator

Dear Senator Breaux:

Under cover of your letter dated October 28, 1987, you were
kind enough to send me a copy of Dr. Raub’s letter to you
dated October 13, 1987 and his inclosure of the "Fact Sheet"
updated to September 8, 1987, concerning the Silver Spring
Monkeys.

I can’t believe that this Fact Sheet was issued by a large
government department as is the Department of Health and
Human Services. If it became separated from the cover
letter no one would know the source of this information for
there is nothing to indicate where it originated or who
wrote it. Some of these government agencies are like
dealing with kindergarten children.

On Page 2, if Delta Center does have "an active
'Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee with at least
one member not affiliated with the institution", I am at a
lost to find out who is on the committee and, particularly,
who is the one member not affiliated with the institution.

On Page 4, it is written that on June 26, 1987, members of
the Louisiana SPCA conducted a site visit and "were joined
by an outside consultant with expertise in primate
veterinary care." I wonder if that outside consultant has a
name? To go on: "The Governor’s office released the SPCA
Inspection Report to the public on August 13." - how? where?
I, for one, can’t find it.

In another paragraph, also on page 4, which begins: "On
November 13, 1986, Brooks, one of the control animals, died
of aspiration pneumonia etc- - - - The necropsy and
pathologist evaluations performed by the Center’s staff were
confirmed by a pathologist not affiliated with NIH or the
Center". It would be nice to know if this person has a
name.

On Page 5: "The sixth monkey, a female rhesus, has
progressed rapidly toward full resocializaation and will
remain at the Delta Center where she has been provided with
a young male cage-mate." I object to Delta using this
vnimal to breed for their research.

' ” ‘ By DONALD REDDY ., -* ,
A doctor kept his Wife’s severed head alive for seven
years —— using a life-support system he built. by hlmselfln
h1s garage.
‘ But after tenderly car1ng for the head for almost a decade a
power outage destroyed the 60— -year- -old oncologist’ 5 experiment in im:

mortality

 

The bizarre details of the doctor’s labor of love -— he 1s identified only as Mi-r
chael —- were given by his friend, N orweg1an cancer specialist Dr. Olav Fosshagen

{fat a medical conference in Belgrade, Yugoslavia . .
' “The story really begins in 1979,” Dr. Fosshagen told a hushed audienCe of 200 medical

specialists, “when Michael’ 8 wife was diagnOSed as having ovarian cancer.

“Later it was found that the cancer had spread to the liver, pancreas and the entire ab-

dominal cavity

“Michael’s wife, she was only 28', Was given

chemotherapy, but after two years it became appar-
‘ ' ent that her days were numbere’d.

“In February 1981, Michael invited me to his.
,. home in northern France and I arrived on the night
of the 16th in a tremendous thunderstOrm.
' “I fOund my friend in a state of extreme agita-
’ tion.- Always a considerate, kindly man, he was

brusque to the point of rudeness.

he said to me:

“ ‘The cancer has spread all over my

Wife’s body. I plan to cut it away.’

“I explained to him that such radical
surgery would surely kill the patient, but
he said: .3

. “ ‘She’ 3 already dead. I’m giving her
the only chance she’ll ever have.’

‘.‘I wished him luck and left for my
home the following day. I didn’t see his

wife Michael told me she wasnt up to
greeting visitors.”

he struggles of the commercial fishermen

237/4”? A/ 0"]? Buras

On Nov. 11 I read Gerrv Wa-
guespack s letter to the editor,
and there are many facts that he
and the public should take a look
at We commercial ﬁshermen are
inka head- to- head battle with
spgrt fishermen because of redf-
1sLh and speckled trout.

I give credit to the Wildlife and
Fisheries Commission, but I am
not sure the commission’s data
are correct. I know they can’t
predict white shrimp and brown
shrimp season until they migrate
in. and the same for redfish. This
is not a native fish, but a migrat-
ing one.

In the seven years I’ve fished
these fish. I have yet to catch a
spawning redfish. These fish are

all on our coastal waters, not just .

in Louisiana.

'Now we are set at a quota of
1.7 million pounds of redfish and
one. million pounds of speckled
trout.

We commercial fishermen
number 12,000. excluding our
families. The sport fishermen
number 187,000. So let’s play ed-
ucation.

: The redfish spawn to reprodu-
ceL‘I‘hese spawning fish, or rats,
are our fish of tomorrow. Now
the sport fishermen catch this
fish only. The fish they catch are
around a pound apiece.

So let’s say it's a nice summer
day and in one day 187,000 sport
fishermen go fishing and stay
within their limit of 50 fish, a
pound apiece. If in one day they
saved the rats, this would be a

catch of 9,350,000 pounds of rat
reds and speckled trout. ,

Where is the conservation? In
one day the sports are all-owed to
catch over 9 million pounds, and
we for the entire year are allowed
1. 7 million and 1 million pounds
Is this fair?

From Empire to Venice, we
ranked. third in the nation for our
seafood, which last year num-
bered 300 million pounds and $45
million for what we sell to the
docks. This is taxable revenue for
the state, and we need‘all the
help we can get.

The money we make goesback
into our boats, equipment, gro-
cery stores, ice houses. house
notes, banks, net shopss restau-
rants, outboard motor com-
panies, 'shipyards, gas stations
and so on, which in turn keeps
business going and keeps the
money in the state.

Not everyone can afford a boat
to go sport fishing, but'all can
enjoy seafood and fish. And
where do they go? To seafood
markets, grocery stores. And
from whom do they get their sea—
food? Us.

Let’s remember we areiCajuns.
and the Cajun craze is sweeping
the nation because of our food.

Without the redfish and the
speckled trout to bring income.
we would have only ﬂounder and
drum as sellable fish - not. much
to choose from.

When we can't shrimp.~we fish.
and without fishing half the year.
we starve. We don’t ask for hand—
outs. We are proud. We work

 

hard in the bitter cold and sum-
mer heat. But we are happy.

My father, a proud‘ American.
always raised me to believe this
was the land of the free and the
home of the brave, but as of
Thanksgiving, I am out of a job
for six months-Where is my free-
dom now?

I am a 27-year-old woman who
is proud and works hard. I enjoy
my work because each day I can
smell the fresh air. bless the
heavens and pray I make money.
I am my own boss. I pay my way
and help feed the nation and
keep the state alive. How much
more fighting do we haveto do?

In the coastal areas. this has
been a way of life for many gen~
erations. How can we let sport
fishermen take our freedom
away?

What if we all agreed. sports
and commercial fishermen. to
catch reds from three to 10
pounds and trout from two to six
pounds in one day and nine mil—
lion pounds of saving the spawn-
ing small fish the sport catches.

"I‘his would mean about. ‘28 mil-

lion pounds we could share. No
reason for quota, just size.

If anyone is interested and
would care to see how commer-
cial fishermen work and hear our
side of the story. the Finfisher-
man Association will meet on
Nov. 17 at 8 p.m. at the Buras
Auditorium. Come see what we
go through to make a living and
put yourself in our shoes for
once.

Processed Meats:
Their “Cure” Is Certainly Not The Best

Do you love eating bacon, sausage and other cured meats, but are con-
cerned about possible health risks? Well, you should be. Aside from the high
level of saturated fats, calories and cholesterol, these “red” processed foods
contain the additive sodium nitrite and/or sodium nitrate. These additives
maintain the desired red color, enhance flavor and prevent the growth of
dangerous bacteria (notably botulism bacteria).

In and of themselves, nitrites and nitrates are not cancer-causing
substances. However, when nitrites and nitrates chemically react with other
food components, with bacteria in the body or when using high cooking
temperatures, they form nitrosamines. Nitrosamines have been shown to
be carcinogenic or cancer causing in laboratory animals and are the alleg—
ed culprits in the processed meat/cancer connection. Some experts feel that
nitrosamines cause stomach and other types ofcancer; others do not think
studies are definite.

In addition to forming nitrosamines, it is also believed that nitrites and
nitrates react with oxyhemoglobin, the molecule responsible for carrying
life-sustaining oxygen to our cells. During the reaction, nitrites and nitrates
prevent oxyhemoglobin from functioning properly. Infants are especially
sensitive to this life-threatening reaction, so health experts often recom-
mend that children under the age of five should not consume large amounts
of nitrite or nitrate containing foods. Today, nitrates and nitrites have been
removed from nearly all baby foods.

Over the years, food processing improvements have reduced the amounts
of nitrites and nitrates in cured foods. Also, vitamin C has been shown to
inhibit nitrosamine formation and is now added during the curing process.
Some research also indicates that vitamin Ii inhibits nitrosamine formation.

The issue of health risks associated with the consumption of foods con-
taining nitrites and nitrates is a complex one. If you are concerned about
nitrite/nitrate consumption, refrain from eating cured meats and check the
labels on other processed foods to see ifeither ofthese substances has been
added.

Mountain lions surrogate "

2%?

By The Associated Press

 

GAINESVILLE, Fla. ——
Experts hope surrogate mothers
will help save the endangered
Florida panther.

The implantation of 10 em-
bryos — one of them half pan-
ther — in two Texas mountain
lions, marks the second use of in
vitro fertilization 1n cats, says
Tom Logan of the state Game
and Freshwater Fish Commis-
sion. “The success rate for the
procedure in humans is about 17
percent. Since it’s only been done
to one other cat, and since that
was only a month ago, there’s no
way of telling what the odds are
for our two surrogate mothers.”

Researchers mixed 50 eggs
from three Texas mountain lions
with sperm from a Florida pan-
ther and two mountain lions to

get the embryos, which were
implanted June 3 by Dr. Mel-
ody Roelke at the University of
Florida veterinary school.

“We should be happy if even .

one embryo is carried to full
term and is born,” said Roelke,
of the Florida Panther Reintroq.
duction Project. Pregnancies in
the cats are 93 days long.

Mountain lions are used be-
cause they are nearly identical
biologically to panthers and be-
cause wildlife laws forbid the
iisggggndangered animals‘in
aﬁny expeer.
Expderfs‘b‘aleve no more than
30 panthers remain.

 

The first in vitro attempt was

last month at the National Zoo, '

Logan said. That involved a
leopard cat, said Roelke.

rescue opinions vary in Florida
'V'Mr, E'J ' ,0.<;AYUU€'

 

By The Associated Press

ORLANDO, Fla. —— A security
guard rescued a giant toad from a
downtown street and splinted its
broken leg with"a paint stirrer,
but one wildlife expert suggested
the pesky four-pound amphibian
would be better dead than fed.

Jim Bartlett, 20, found the 9-
inch green-and-brown toad when
he got out of his car after seeing

 

an animal that had evidently
been hit by a vehicle.

Wildlife and agriculture offi- '

cials believe it is a Bufo marinus,
a giant toxic toad native to
coastal areas in South America
but introduced to South Florida
in the 19303 to try to control the
beetle population in sugar cane
fields. They grow up to a foot
long and are sometimes found
around Miami.

4..._—__-_______.._.

“I have never heard of one that
far north,” said Henry
Mushinsky, a biologist at the
University of South Florida in
Tampa.

Wildlife and agriculture offi-
cials fear the giant toad could
become a proliferating pest on
the order of the Mediterranean
fruit ﬂy, the Formosan termite or
the South American ﬁre ant.

James J. Kilpatrick é/Ir/rxwmm. V’ZME? naval/er

ASHINGTON. — Rose Cipol-
lone, we see by the papers,
began smoking in 1941. She
smoked heavily for 43 years.

  
 

1.”. 1.}
- a:
41‘!

She died of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of g

58. A few days ago a federal jury in New Jer-
'sey awarded her estate a $400,000 judgment
against the Liggett Group, makers of L&M
cigarettes. It was a bum rap.

A bum rap for this reason: The verdict was
one more manifestation of a disease that
afﬂicts our society —— a disease more preva-
lent and more devastating than cancer or

‘AIDS. Call it The Devil Made Me Do It syn-

drome. Or to label it more bluntly, call it irre-
sponsibility, for that is what it is.

Mrs. Cipollone was neither deaf nor blind.
We may fairly assume that she read newspa-
pers and magazines, that she watched tele-
vision, that she communicated with
neighbors. She was not living in a nunnery or
in a hermit’s cave. She was living in New

Jersey, for pete’s sake, not on some uninha-
bited island.

The point is that Mrs. Cipollone knew that
smoking was a hazard to her health. She
knew it in the same way that one knows
about edged tools, rickety ladders and re-
treaded tires. At least since 1966, when her
L&Ms began to carry the surgeon general’s
label, she held stern warnings in her hand.
She lighted up in deﬁance of public cautions
and common sense. She smoked because she
wanted to smoke. The devil didn’t - make her
do it. The advertising didn’t make her do it.
She did it all by her little old self.

The trial jury wafﬂed by concluding that
Mrs. Cipollone was 80 percent responsible.
Horsefeathers! She was 100 percent responsi-
ble. Over the past 10 years, since the surgeon
general’s report of 1979, an estimated 10 mil-
lion persons have stopped smoking. There
were an estimated 30 million ex-smokers
then; there are an estimated 40 million now.

. _.,_N_ . .em‘s‘mmw.

 

 

   

Rose Cipollone
Why didn't she quit smoking?

The lady might have been among that num-
ber. She willfully chose to take a chance.

We have reared a generation of whiners
and buck passers. The young person who
experiments with drugs won’t admit to being
stupid: No, “peer pressure” is to blame. The

' boy who drops out of school doesn’t drop out

because he’s a lazy bum; it’s because of his
“disadvantaged environment.” Nobody is at
fault for anything. A whole system of “no
fault” insurance and “no fault” divorce has
pushed personal responsibility aside. The
devil must be a very busy fellow. His phone
rings all the time.

I said some of these things the other day in
the matter of AIDS. The fearful disease pri-
marily affects two groups — male homosex-
uals and drug addicts. The virus is
transmitted by anal intercourse and dirty
needles. I suggested mildly that public com-

 

 

at

 

gels THIS .50

 

passion, under these circumstances, might
well be somewhat restrained. This observa-
tion produced an indignant letter from a
public relations guy in the devil’s home ofﬁce.
“Who you are,” he said, “has nothing to do
with whether you are in danger of being .
infected with the AIDS virus. What matters
is what you do.” Precisely. .

In this business of smoking and lung can- -
cer, what matters is what the smoker does.
He smokes. It is a dumb thing to do, and ev-
eryone with the sense God gave a grasshopper
knows it is a dumb thing to do.

It is not necessary to buy all of the surgeon
general’s evidence of causality, for some of
the evidence is on the shaky side. No investi-
gamﬂet has been able to induce cancer in
labdratgry animalﬂy an 3 . e als
to _t_he inhalation of tobacco smoke. Evidence
of‘causality reliés chiefly upon correlations
and associations and the kind of raw data
that good statisticians regard with a skeptical
eye.

Even so, the statistical correlations are im-
pressive, though it remains unclear why some
heavy smokers die of cancer at 58 and other
heavy smokers stink up the house until
they’re 90. Without getting into autopsies and
detailed personal histories, we know that
heavy smokers, as a class, have shorter life
spans than non-smokers or light smokers.
The data on women who smoke is convincing.
Various statistically valid studies have told us
that the smoker who ‘quits, and stays quit,
will reduce the hazards to his health.

-, Why, then, didn’t Rose Cipollone quit?
Why don’t all smokers quit? The answer is"
that she simply didn’t want to quit, not in her
heart of hearts, not really and truly. But to
accept that hard truth isn’t easy. Hello, devil?
Cipollone here. As I say, his phone rings all
the time. 3

Researchers ﬁx genetic

NEW YORK -——- Scientists
have corrected a serious genetic
defect in liver cells in a labo-
ratory experiment they described
as an important ﬁrst step toward

a Wan gene therapy.

 

In the experiments, copies of a
normal human gene were trans-
' planted into liver cells from rab-
bits, curing an important genetic

aw in the cells. Until these
experiments, the liver was not
widely regarded as a target for
gene therapy because of difﬁcul-
tieiin achieving successfgl trans-
plants of genetically altered liver

€21.3- (nf Hm mac-I7?)

The long—range objective of the
studies is to transplant genes into
the human liver to cure hered-
itary diseases. The first target
would be familial hypercholeste-
rolemia, a rare disease in which
patients develop excessive
amounts of fatty materials in
their blood early in life. In severe
cases, which occur in only one in
a million people, the patients de-
velop heart disease in childhood
and often die of heart attack by
the age of 20 years.

 

 

The hereditary disease results
from a genetic defect in liver cells

that severely hampers the cells’
ability to clear the blood of low-

density lipoproteins, which are '

the fatty substances in blood that
have been most closely linked to
heart disease.

In the experiments, the liver
cells’ ability to absorb the lipo-
protein was restored to normal.
The transplanted gene that pro-
duced this effect was the genetic
code of instructions for produc-
ing a receptor on the surface of

. liver cells to which the lipopro-

tein would normally become

attached. In patients suffering .
from the hereditary liver disease, '

the receptor is either missing
from liver cells or is ineffective.
Some of the cells treated by
transplanting genes produced ﬁve
times as many of the lipoprotein
receptors as are present in a nor-
mal liver cell, said Dr. Richard C.
Ml1_l_ligan of the Whitehead Insti-

. tute for Biomedical Researc and -

the’Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. '
The new research was pub-
lished in the latest issue of The

head Institute? and Dr. David E. . '2,

DANVILLE, Ill. —- From
home on the range to home on
the grange, wild mustangs that
once faced hunger out West ﬁnd
love and care on heartland farms
and in East Coast stables. ~

The federal government’s
adopt—a-horse program has found
new homes and owners for about

84,000 of these mustangs since‘j M“

the mid-19708, helping to thin ‘

out the wild herd.
“They are wild when you get
them, but they turn into affec-

tionate puppy dogs that follow, 1

you around like household pets,”
said Cesi Bell, attending the
latest adoption session in Dan-
ville over the weekend. “You’ve
got to convince the horse you are
not going to hurt him —— he’s got
totrust you.”

Charlie Most of the federal
' Bureau of Land Management
said there is at least one opportu-
nity a month in the eastern
United States for people to adopt
a wild mustang.

 

“Some people expect some I

scruffy, shaggy, potbellied thing,
but these are very fine looking
animals,” Most said. “They are
not mean, but they are afraid at
_ ﬁrst. They need confidence.”

He expected no trouble ﬁnding
homes for the 125 horses brought
to this east-central Illinois city,

”90' “4—7 73m ens” Fawn/é

“This place is swarming with
people and there is lots of enthu-
srasm,” said Most, as the adop-
tions began Friday.

Tens of thousands of the ani-
mals are roaming free in several
westerrfi states, eating forage
meant or cattle. nder a 1971
law passed in response to com-

plaints from ranchers, the bureau

 

is required to round up excess
wild horses onthe Western

range.

It used to kill the surplus ani-
mals, but abandoned that prac-
tice in 1982 and started adoptions
after protests by animal rights
activists.

Prospective owners must
promise good care and adequate

facilities. They pay $125, which
helps cover the cost of catching
the horses, bringing them to the
adoption site and providing
exams and shots by a veterinar-
ran.

Owning a horse also takes
about $30 a month in good feed,
fresh water, and a stall with 6-
foot wooden fences.

New link _
in narcolepsy

puzzle found w
(7,0.sz N. 0.1.15.
By MALCOLM BITTER

AP science writer '
7" WE? fl??? 7 017,6

I .

NEW YORK — A new. genetic
ﬁnding adds a wrinkleto a puz-
zling link between the immune
system and n colepsy, a disease
of excessive sleepiness that
afflicts an estimated 200,000
Americans. "

 

More research might help
expose the cause of the disease,‘
which includes irresistable day-
time sleepiness, attacks of sudden
weakness or physical collapse,".

. and hallucinations.

The link to the disease-ﬁghting
immune system concerns a pro-
tein that appears on the surface'
of some immune—system cells.

One variant of the protein,
called HLA-D_I32, appears in
ab—Jut 25 percent of the popula-
tion but in some 99 percenLgf
narcoleptics, says John Holloman 3
of the Stanford UniversitLSchool
of @‘dicine. " W

 

Holloman and others studied
the gene that acts as a blueprint
for the protein, comparing the
gene from narcoleptics to that
taken from other people. A dif— 5
ference might give a clue to what
goes wrong in narcoleptics.

But new studies shOw the gene
from narcoleptics is entirely nor-
mal, Holloman said in a recent
interview. He now plans to look
for the protein in the brains of

narcoleptics and of do 3 that
have a version of narcolepsy.
Maybe the disease results from
an abnormal attack by the
immune system on its own tis-
sues, he said. Or maybe the prob-
lem is an abnormal binding cf the
protein to a neurotransmitter, a

substance brain cells use to com-
municate.

Merrill Mitler, director of re-

search at the Scrjgpsglinicﬁleep

Disorders Center in La Jolla,
Calif, is taking a’ different tack. ’

Narcolepsy runs in families,
which suggests some genetic role.
Since the HLA—DR2 gene is nor-
mal, maybe the culprit is some
other gene that lies nearby on the
gene-carrying structures called
chromosomes, he said. Genes
lying close to each other tend to
be inherited together, so the .»
HLA-DR2 gene would show up»
often in people who inherited the
nearby gene, he said.

 

 

 

 




 

THE GLOBE AND MAIL, THURSDAY, bECEMeEn 1 s, 1986

Bn the seal pup hunt,

‘ royal commission says .

Canadian Press and Special

Canada should officially end the
hunting of seal pups but allow a
carefully controlled hunt of adult
' seals for which there is a market,
Mr. Justice Albert Malouf recom-
mended yesterday.

Judge Malouf told a news confer-
ence in Ottawa that studies done for
his royal commission on sealing
“show most people are not against
hunting . . . but they disliked the
killing of young pups.”

His threevolume report, which
took more than two years and $23
million to complete, was tabled in
the Commonsby Fisheries Minister
Thomas Siddon.

Mr. Siddon said afterward that he
accepts many of the recommenda-
tions, but not Judge Malouf’s call
for more than $100-million in assis-
tance to seal hunters.

their backs," Mulligan said. “Ev-
erybody was sober. You had to be,
especially after sneaking in. You
had to maintain a low profile.”
Marineland "officials would not
comment, on the incident, but Wil-
liams said Mulligan andBerg would
have been charged with a felonyif
they had harmed, the whales.
Mulligan said he hasn’t spoken to
anyone at Marineland since the
incident, but he said he will offer
them some advice when he does.
“They really should tighten up

security there," said Mulligan, who _

confessed to having climbed the
same fence many times as a youth.
“I love whales, and I wouldn’t do
anything to harm them. But I
understand there are some weirdos
out there who would go in there
with a screwdriver or something
and hurt them.”

He said the Government will
provide more than $5-million during
the next four years to help find new
markets for seal products.

Small-boat fishermen in the Mari-
times were pleased that the report
recognizes the problems they have
with grey seals, but some officials
fear a boycott of Canadian fish
products will occur if the animals
are killed.

Allan Billard, spokesman for the
Eastern Fishermen’s Federation
which represents inshore Nova Sco-
tia fishermen, said the report “is
great. I' could have written it my-
self.”

And Gordon Cummings, president
of National Sea Products, noted that
grey seals eat about 150,000 tonnes
of fish annually, while the Non
Scotia industry catches 225,000
tonnes.

Damage to small-boat fisher-
men’s gear and competition for fish
are the most often cited reasons for
a cull by the fishing industry.

The grey seal’s contribution to
the so-called seal worm problem ——
in which seals are hosts to a number

 

of parasites of fish — is a major
reasons that the Eastern Fisher-
men’s Federation wants the herd
culled, was not agreed on by the
commission. ’

Nor did animal-rights activists
agree with the report’s call for a
herd cull. Beverly Pinnegar,
spokesman for the Greenpeace
Foundation in Vancouver, said:
“What I think they’re doing is blam-
ing these seals for an over-all prob-

lem in the fishery . . . There has
been declining fish stocks since the
late 19603; the fishery is a dreadful
problem. At this point in time, the
Government is choosing to use the
seals as as a scapegoat.”

Judge Malouf, a member of the
Quebec Court of Appeal, said a
European Community ban on im-
ports of seal-pup pelts was wrong

: because the seals were not killed in

a cruel fashion and the hunts were
not going to make the seal herds
extinct.

The EC imposed the ban three
years ago, virtually destroying the
annual spring hunt for. harp and
hooded seal pups off northeastern
Newfoundland and in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, as well as the hunt by
: Inuit in the Arctic.

Mr. Siddon said he will not offi-
cially end the hunt for seal pups
because there has been no commer-
cial hunt for three years. He added,
however, the Government would do
nothing to encourage a resumption.

eries and Oceans Minister Tho-
mas Siddon said yesterday.

ment’s $5-million ,aid package

THE GLOBE ANDMAIL, MONO/w. ‘l‘jEchBEn 29, 1986'

The fUture

After some two years of work
and $2.8-milli0n in expenses, Mr.
Justice Albert Malouf has pro-
vided a comprehensive 100k at
sealing in Canada. The recom-
mendations of his Royal Com-
mission on Seals and the Sealing
Industry may, in an emergency,
be boiled down to two: kill only

’ older seals, and only ifyou do so

humanely; and provide money
to sealers hurt by the collapse in
the sealskin market.

Much of what he writes is

' what any reasonable observer

would c'onclude on the evidence.
A society that regularly Slaugh-
ters cows in abbatoirs has no
ethical or moral basis. on which
to oppose. the killing of seals for
food . or. clothing, provided the
killing is demonstrably humane.
For that reason, he, accepts club-
bing and urges further teSts of a
special pistol; he the

, netting of seals, and the deliber;

ate wounding cf the creatures in
open“ water to facilitate their
retrieval, as agents of consider-
able suffering. .,

He addresses the a
that seals'should be killed both
to stop the spread of parasites to
fish, and to keep the seals from
competing with fishermen for
their catch. Heargues against a
cull of harp seals, but-saysthe
arguments are “evenly bal-

' anced” for a cull of grey, seals -

the unknown ~, factor being the
degree of public opposition to
such a slaughter. _ ,

The .commerCial seal hunt
collapsed in 198283 when the

European Commission banned

the importation of pelts of harp
seal pups (whitecoats) and hood-
ed seal pups (bluebacks) into
Western Europe. the. essential
market for such skins. Judge

rguments .

for-sealing

Malouf sees no way to resurrd:
that part of the hunt. He alto
sees little chance for Canadians,
to sell even the pelts of '01 Hr
seals outside C‘anada, unless _
Inuit do so (using a distinctive
trademark) in the hope thht
Greenpeace and like-minded
groups will tolerate MW
hunters. -
He wants the government to
spend $50-million to compensate
those in the sealing industry,
including sealskin pmcessom,
for their lost income, and up to
$20-million over five years in
special relief payments to Intlit
hunters. We do not think the
government should make a hahit

of compensating peopl
markets that have disappearzr

He also wants the government to
spend ism-million to retrain '

ers and support the marketing pf

products from older seals.

come. Estimates of me annual
value of the seal hunt on Cana-
da's east'coast, before the ct!-
lapse of the market, range fro '
Sl.5-milli‘on to 85-million'.
government’s offer seems very
fair. ‘ ' ' i
The basic conclusion in one
report is that the hunting of. .,
er seals should continue, for food
and clothing and, ' possi.
ble, the marketing of skins. The
market may never again ap-
proach the one that existed be-
fore 19m, but it is thereto b‘e
developed. This is an optimistic
finding, but not unduly so; and!
the government’s help, them
may yet be a partial recovery
from the unfair international
blow to the sealing industry. ‘

Aleuts fear loss of hunting rights

B y Chriss Swaney
'l‘irnesﬁrtter

Pribiiof Island Aleut leaders
fear they may lose the right to.
hunt North Pacific fur seals for
subszstence under changes pro-
posed by the National Marine
Fisheries Service.

‘ The NMFS ias'. month pro-
posed that Pribilof Island fur
sea‘ hercL be designated as

'depleted‘ under the Marine-

Mammal Protection ACt

Timothy R. E. Keenev, deputt
general counsel for the Nationa
Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration. said the current
seal population is 50 percent
below normal. NOAA is the urn
brelia organization for NMFS.

Keeney. one of aboutZOpeople
who attended a public hearing on
the proposed changes, also said
the low levels are endangering
the seals‘ level of reproduction

”The changes have been pro

posed to preserve the herd and
nothing more," Keeney said at

the hearing at Anchorage' s Fed
eral Bull

Bur Pribiiof leaders say the
proposals are just a ploy to give
animal protectionist groups and
environmentalists a chance to
stop subsistence seal harvests
which netted 3.384 seals in me.

“We' re going to lose our sub
sistence harvest the same way
we lost the commercial nar-
vest, said Adnan Melovidox,
president of the St. Paul Aleut
community.

Pribilof Islanders have killed
seals for nearly 200 years since
the Aleuts were enslaved by the
Russians and taken to the wind-
swept islands in the Bering Sea.

The commercial harves con
tinued under a four-nation treaty
that has existed in some form
since 1911. But in 1985, because of
a declining seal population. ani-
mal protection groups launched
a campaign against renewrng the
treaty.

Now, the campaign has

 

 

 

 

shifted to preserving a declining
seal herd, which numbers about
800,0011 today compared with 1.5
mi‘ lion in the late 19505

"w'e re also concemed about
the fate of the seal herd. bur we
disagree with the move to de
Clare ”the herd depleted." said
Larry Merculieff, a member of
the-Pribilof Fur Seal Commis-
sron The commission was
formed last year to help renew
an international treaty permir
ting the. commercial harvest of
seals.

Declaring the seal herd
depleted IS “premature and lacks
scientific basis." Merculieff said.

Merculieff and other New
leaders said studies show the en-
tire ecosystem of the Bering Sea
isin danger.

“Food shortages for both
seals and birds have contributed
to declines. but some NMFS off”:-
crals refuse to make the correla-
tion.” Merculieff said

Merculieff urged NMFS offl—

 

cials Wednesday to call for im-
mediate investigation into the
health of pollock stocks in the

“We also would like to see
some government support of our
proposed Bering Sea scientific
conference." Merculieff said
The conference is expected to
cost about $30,000, and some
316.000 already has been raised,
Merculieff said.

Steve Zimmerman, a biologist
familiar with the Pribiloi fur
seals, also says more research is
needed. “There are some scien-
tists in the community who dis-
agree about

natives

to hunt whales
report urges

By David Israelson Toronto Star

. Canada should rejointhe International Whaling Commisswn
and consider letting natives in the western Arctic resume the
hunting of whales, 3 major conservation group says.

Rejoining the international body, which Canada quit in 1981,
would “help resolve the question of resuming a harvest” of bow-
head whales, the World Wildlife Fund’s Canadian branch says in
a $2 million study released yesterday.

The three-year study, launched
by Prince Philip, who heads the
wildlife group, looked at the three
types of .whales found in Canada’s
Arctic — bowheads, narwhal and
belugas. v
. It found that:

Cl The situation for Canada’s Arc-
tic whales “is a complex picture of
some endangered populations, con-
trasted with pockets of abun-
dance.” ~

El Letting the western Arctic’s na-
tives hunt bowheads — now for-
bidden —- should be considered be-
cause there are up to 4,000 of the
whales there, compared with only
hundreds in the east, and because
it is a tradition for the people
there. '

D Belugas, or white whales, num-
ber between 25,000 and 30,000 in
the Arctic, but are declining in the
east, so hunting by natives now al-
lowed there should be reduced in
Hudson Bay and banned in Ungava
Bay, which faces Baffin Island.

El Belugas near northern Quebec
could be harmed by large-scale
water diversion schemes, such as a
pro osal to divert northern waters
to t e United States.

Cl There appear to be at least 22,-
500 narwhals, found only in the
eastern Arctic, but the species
could suffer “serious disturbance”
due to noise from icebreakers and
foil and gas operations.

Whaling quotas

More research is needed on the
threat to the narwhals, but the
problem could be minimized by
having ships consider the whales’
migration patterns when setting
routes and schedules, said the wild-
life fund’s Canadian president,
Monte Hummel.

In the western Arctic, allowing
natives to hunt bowheads should be
considered because “there is a
history of aboriginal whaling for
bowheads on the Canadian side of
the Beaufort Sea, carefully docu-
mented by residents,” the report
said.

The bowheads are classified as
endangered and cannot be hunted
in Canada, but the United States
allows hunting by Alaska’s natives.

Whale hunting by natives — the
only type now allowed in Canada
-— is not normally of concern to
the International Whaling Com-
mission, which focuses on commer-
cial whaling.

three-year Whales Beneath The Ice
program -— seven research
projects designed to help conserve
Canada’s three most northern
whale species, the beluga, the nar-
whal and the bowhead whale.

The bowhead is endangered and
conservationists are concerned
about serious declines in the popu-
lations of the other two species.

Concern hi north

There are at least 16 references

about as many pages concerning
assistance of, the ac owledgment
of, and the concern of northern
peoples and their need to kill
whales, “. . . at a time when many
Arctic residents are understand-
ably concerned about the motives
of wildlife conservationists.”

The wildlife fund explains that a
Canadian workshop on marine
mammals, in 1981, stated: “The
present data base is not sufficient
to allow adequate management of
Arctic marine mammals.”

But Canada should rejoin the
body because whales taken by
Canadian natives “would be from
the same stock presently harvested
by Alaskan native peoples,” the re-
port'says. ..

Ottawa quit the commission in
1981 on the grounds that Canada is
no longer involved in commercial
whaling.

Nevertheless Arctic marine
mammals are killed, both as a re-
sult of hunting by north in resi-
dents and from the effects of
northern development. Whales Be-
neath The Ice was supposed to
identify critical conservation
needs, act as a catalyst to obtain
longer term commitments for re-
search and conservation action by
others, and to use the Canadian
commitment as a catalyst for
northern wildlife conservation ac-
tivity by other agencies and coun-
tries.

The question as to whether the
wildlife fund’s major objectives
have been realized must remain
open for the time being. One of the
guiding principles for the projects
the organization helped to fund
was that each must be scientifical-
ly sound and lead to some impor-
tant specific conservation result.

Scientific research is done pre-
cisely to learn something not
previOusly known and the results
can only be guessed at until the re-
search has been completed and
verified.

Each project was also designed
to be taken over by another agency
to produce results over a longer
period. The wildlife fund, in Cana-
da, does not fund a project unless
the funding is matched by others,
and does not provide funding for
more than three years.

The results of all this, judging
from the booklet published, range
from fascinating and important to

disappointing. A study of belugas
in estuaries showed that there are
more belugas in estuaries where
they are not hunted than in estu-
aries where they are hunted.

Less obvious was the finding that
belugas are tremendously depend-
ent upon the estuaries. The wildlife
fund calls for an end to hunting of
belugas in the Ungava Bay area of
northern Quebec until stocks
recover, and calls for a “harvest”
0f belugas in eastern Hudson Bay
to not exceed 5 per cent of the
minimum population estimate of
1,124 animals.

Although studies to separate dis-
creet beluga and narwhal stocks b
the sounds they make and to deve
op a permanent tagging system for
whales were largely unsuccessful
in the three-year period of the pro-
gram, the wildlife fund calls for re-
search to continue in those areas.

One of the concerns of many
conservationists is that there is not
enough accurate information on
population sizes to justify commer-
cial exploitation of the narwhal.

I doubt the wildlife fund’s re
search will completely allay those
concerns in the international wild-
life community. In my opinion, the
recommendation for“. . . a long-
term research study in an aquari-
um where captive whales other
than narwhals could be used to in-
ject harmless markers such as

tetracycline, to determine the rate
at which growth layers are laid
down in certain tissues such .38
teeth” is ill advised. .‘y‘;

Tetracycline causes grow-11':
rings in teeth (similar toth-e
growth rings in a cross section of $1
tree trunk) to be fluorescent '
viewed under special lighting
conditions, and thus allow the age
of the animal to be determined.

(continued)

But Without: knowing theta-1e of
deposit, the factors governing
those rates and such research
would not produce results that
could be extrapolated to free living
members of the same species, let
alone an entirely different species.» '

The wildlife fund learned much
about bowheads, including the dis-
covery of a substantial number of
this endangered species encounter-
ed in Isabella Bay in 1984 and 1985;:
It recommends that Canada rejoin
the International Whaling Com-
mission as “. . . an appropriate
body to help resolve the matter of.
resuming a harvest of bowheads
by the Inuvialuit, because whales
taken would be from the same
stock presently harvested by Alas-_
kan native peoples (and is there
fore) an international concern . . -
and. . .will require Canadian par:
ticipation in the body whose task it
is to arrive at international co-
operation in aboriginalharvesting
of the stock.” , «

INoﬁnbﬁmmm

In fact, as the wildlife fund
should know, the International
Whaling Commission does not
exercise jurisdiction over aborigi-
nal hunts. It appears that the wild-
life fund wants the killing of how-
heads by aboriginal hunters to be
restored.

I believe it is unfortunate that
nowhere in the document is the
contribution of living whales to the
environment, or to non “native”
humans, mentioned. _

Certainly areas of concentration
of such wondrous species as the
beluga, narwhal and the bowhead
would be immensely attractive to
many tourists. While I believe the
present data base is still- not suffi*
cient to allow adequate manage
ment of Arctic marine-mammals,
the wildlife fund has brought us
closer to that goal. -

Mowat angry
over prospect
of seal killing

BY MICHAEL LEWIS
The Globe and Mail

if Fisheries Minister Thomas
Siddon decides on a plan to kill grey
seals to control their numbers, “the
whole world will fall on top of him
and he’ll bloody well deserve it,”
Canadian writer Farley Mowat
says.

Mr. Mowat said last week that
such a plan would be one more
example of a policy that is driving
living creatures from the face of the
earth. “If we continue on the path
that we have chosen, we will end up
in a world in which we are the only
large form of life left.”

 

.‘PBL ANS f-.‘.Ali.. MONDAY, DECEMBER 22, 1986

The author was speaking at a
news conference in Toronto held by
Greenpeace International to discuss
the report of the Royal Commission
on Seals and Sealing,

Although an organized grey seal
kill is not recommended in the re-
port, it says fish can be protected if
7,000 grey seals a year are culled.

nThose participating in the news

conference were angered by com-
ments made by Mr. Siddon, who
said the report does recommend an
annual cull of the seals.

. -' Canadian fishermen have long

complained that grey seals are
depriving them of their livelihood
by eating fish stocks. Members of
Greenpeace and others at the con-
ference said the grey seals are only
now recovering from excessive
exploitation.

Mr. Mowat said mankind contin.
ties the slaughter of animals be-
cause man is an ignorant animal.

-' “We don’t respond to the reality
of life as other forms of life do. We
have the intellectual capacity for
blaming other forms of life for the
disastrous consequences of our own
actions.”

Fishermen and environmental
groups are taking sides after feder-
al Fisheries Minister Thomas Sid-
don raised the possibility of a West
Coast seal hunt.

While fishermen say increasing
seal populations threaten British
Columbia’s $450-million fishing
industry, Greenpeace and the Sea
Shepherd Conservation Society say
they will vigorously oppose a hunt.

“The seal situation has been out
of control for years,” said Lee
Straight, a spokesman for the B.C.
sport fishing industry. “There isn’t
room for both of us.”

The controversy began when Mr.
Siddon appeared on a television talk
show and a fisherman called and
said that he shoots seals on sight.
Mr. Siddon replied that something
must be done about “the overpopu-

The herd was gathered from 5,500
caribous that papulate the barrens of
the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland
and brought to Orono, in the northern
part of Maine, in mid-December. Cari:

ago, and the goal of the project is to
have a self-sustaining herd in a decade.
The surviving herd will be kept to

then released into the wild. The first
calves will be released in 1988 or 1989,

Mr. Siddon also said he would
back a seal hunt if his new fisheries
advisory committee recommends
one.

“If the minister calls for any kind
of large-scale slaughter, we’ll fight
it,” said Greenpeace spokesman
Beverly Pinnegar. “They’re just
making the seal a scapegoat. The
problem is fisheries mismanage-

ment.”

Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd
group said he “will not tolerate” ,a
West Coast seal hunt.

Many sport fishing areas are
being hit by hungry sea lions.

Radio collars and other techniques
will be used to study and track the ani-

we’re going to do it right,” Mr. McCol-
lough said.

Other states are watching the
project, he said, including Idaho, where
officials, after a failed attempt this fall,
are planning a caribou capture for
spring from British Columbia.

The caribous started disappearing
from Maine and other states in the’.
northern part of the country in the mid-i
1900’s, primarily because too many’
were killed. They were the favorite-
food of lumberjacks invlogging camps
in Maine, Mr. McCollough said.

A11 Ambitious New Look at the Language of Dolphins

BALO ALTO (All—Ken Norris
has. been listening to dolphins for a
longtime, and he thinks the intelli~
gent creatures have a lot to teach
humans.

“It’s funny-nwhenever you talk
about their human attributes, peo-
ple' s ears perk up," Norris said

“Everyone thinks, ‘What are they
saying about us?’ ”

It‘s not so much what they’ re
saying, but how they re saying and
thinking it that interests Norris, a
biologist at the University of Cali-
fornia, Santa Cruz.

.-After more than 30 years of
working with dolphins, Norris has
launched an ambitious study to
learn how they communicate, think
and perceive their watery world.

His subjects will be two Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins, Josephine, , 22,
ofSan Diego and Gwendolyn, 18, of
Hawaii, who arrived on campus in
July after years of serving the
Navy.

' ‘Break Down Barrier-11’

They will be joined later by six
smaller recruits—Pacific white-
sided dolphins from Monterey
Bay--- who will complete the
school, giving the Santa Cruz sci-
entists a large, diverse class of the
cetaceans

:‘It’ 3 important to break down
the barriers between us and other
higher animals to help us diffuse
our arrogance about the world,”
Norris said in an interview at the
[LC Long Marine. Laboratory,
where he is director of cetacean

research and professor of natural
history. .

“What’s going to be shown is
that the difference is absolutely
insensible. .that there are more
commonalities than differences be-

tween the higher marine mammals

and Homo sapiens. ”
When Norris, 62, started study-
ing dolphins'in 1953 as the'first

curator of Marineland on the Palos '

Verdes Peninsu‘a, there was a

“tremendous vacuum of knowledge '

about them,” he said. ,
So little was known that Norris
was sent to. the Pacific Ocean to

- find out if there were dolphins near

Los Angeles, he said. His first
experience trying to capture the
mammals suggested they used
more than their eyes to escape.

“We were trying to net those. . .
animals and they were twice as
smart as we were,” Norris said.
“We began to realize they had an
amazing sonar system.”

In the years that followed, he

worked with a captive dolphin
named Cathy in tests that provided
“the first unequivocal confirmation
that the animals had sonar.”
’ “These dolphins put up with a lot
of baloney sometimes,” Norris said.
“Some of them are smart enough
that when you get a dumb trainer
who’s going too slowly,- you can see
a dolphin drumming his fingers and
thinking, ‘Get on with it.’ ”

His early work on dolphin sonar
was published in 1961. Subsequent
studies found that dolphins emit

we realized that the animals could
release a sound beam, like a flash-
light beam, that was a very intense,
highly directed beam of sound, ”
Norris said.

The way the beam bounces off an
object and returns as an echo helps
the creatures identify boats, fish

and other objects. It is Norris",

intent, working with other re-
searchers and head trainer Kathy
Krieger at Santa Cruz, to determine

7 how dolphins emit and receive the

sound.

It is Norris’ hypothesis that dol-
phins hear through their jaws, not
their tiny pinhole-like ears. He also
will try to prove that dolphins
catch fish by disarming them with
sound.

His theory is that dolphins zap

. prey with sound at an intense, low

pitch calculated to make the fish

“dotty with too much noise.”
Additional experiments will

compare how dolphins use sight

. and sonar abilities to identify and

recognize an object—to see if they
can interchange acoustic and visual

perceptions.

Perhaps the most intriguing re-
search will be conducted by Norris
and graduate student Carol How-
ard, a speech pathologist, who will
study the way dolphins communi-
cate. .

“How does a school of dolphins
decide to go to sea?” Norris said.
“They sit around and whistle at
each other until they get a chorus
going.”

Like a symphony of musicians
warming up together, the dolphins
will spend hours trying to “get
their act tOgether” so that they are
sojin tune they can swim out in the
deeper water as a society that is in
harmony, he said.

They have a repertoire of sounds
for other situations. They may
whistle and move in rhythm one
way in courtship, and another Way
when they' re feeling threatened or
aggressive.

“Cetaceans are remarkable, lov-
able beasts,” Norris said, as he
watched them swim in their tank.
“I don’t want people to live with
the myth—the mythical beast that
will take over New York City.

“The true animal is terribly
much more interesting"

It could not be immediately determined what will
happen to Marineland's many animals. A telephone
recording on Thursday still invited tourists to visit the

park’s “many fascinating sea exhibits,’

’ including the

Baja Reef, billed as “the world’s only swim-through

aquarium.”

Marineland, the venerable aquatic park on the Palos
Verdes Peninsula, will be closed March 1 by new
owners who plan to develop the property “in an
orderly and dignified fashion,” it was announced
Thursday.

Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the company which
bought the 33— —year- -old facility for a reported $23. 4
million on Dec. 30, said it is closing the attraction
because the picturesque park is losing money, and
more than $25 million in improvements will be needed
if the park is to break even financially. Marineland’s
300 employees will be given severance pay and help in
finding new jobs, the company said in a prepared
statement.

Jack Snyder, spokesman for Harcourt, could not be
reached for comment, and Marineland spokeswoman
Laurie Armstrong said she could not elaborate on the
statement. Harcourt, known primarily as a book
publisher, owns four aquatic parks, including Sea
World in San Diego.

that any development would retain public access to the
shorefront.

The Rancho Palos Verdes City Council on Monday
passed an emergency ordinance restricting develop-
ment of the land. Any future development plans could
also be appealed to the California Coastal Commission.

When Harcourt bought Marineland after little more
than a week of negotiations, it said it planned to
continue to operate the park under the same name with
present management.

As recently as Monday, Edward Asper, a Sea World
vice president, told a reporter that Harcourt was still
evaluating Marineland to determine its future. Asper
said there were no immediate plans to make changes at
the park.

But fears that Marineland might be closed surfaced
when killer whales Corky and Orky, Marineland’s
premier attractions, were trucked during the night of
Jan. 20 to Sea World in San Diego. At the time,
Marineland officials said the move was made so that
the animals could breed with Sea World's three killer .
whales.

Yet 1n its announcement Thursday, Harcourt said it
moved the whales because they were “in danger" by

Wildlife Management Seeks Solutions to Questions on Trapping

 

To the Editor:

I would like to congratulate John B.
Oakes for certain aspects of his Dec.
29 Op-Ed column, “The Fur Coat
Trap.” I would like to add the obser-
vation that the manufacture and sale

, of fur garments is the last industry in
this country dealing in handcrafted
items of high value and great durabil-
ity. Furs are marketed by a large
number of small-business people,

many in a family-operated enterprise -

handed down for several generations.

Mr. Oakes also shows a concern for
the proper treatment of animals. No
one, including the retail furriers I
represent, is in favor of the cruel
treatment of animals. I do, however,
have a serious problem with some of
Mr. Oakes’s statements.

Let me take as an example the ar-
- gument that "overpopulation of any
: animal species is normally regulated
by natural environmental factors.”
‘ This statement is terribly na’ive. The
“natural”balancing mechanisms are
both cruel and dangerous. They are
so cruel to the animals involved that
if human beings were intentionally to
do the same thing that nature does to
reach a balance — essentially inflict
starvation and disease —- they would
be condemned and jailed for gross
mistreatment of animals.

The natural balancing mechanisms
are dangerous to other animal popu-
lations and to people -— through de-
struction of food crops and livestock,
the spread of disease to other wildlife
and to humans, and the creation of
serious imbalances between wildlife
populations and their habitat.

The issue of trapping is complex
and difficult. It .is tied up with the

major concern of our times for the
conservation of wildlife in the face of
increasing human use of our land and
water resources. Many responsible
groups, including professional wild-
life managers in this country and
around the world, are grappling with
the questions raised about the taking
of wild fur, the protection of crops and
the control of disease. Research is
going on continually in the improve-
ment of trapping systems.

Through professional wildlife man-
agement we have worked some real
miracles in this country. We have re-
turned from the brink of wiping out
many species through the unregu-
lated harvests of the last century. To-
day, there are more individuals of
more species of wildlife thriving in
the US. than there were 100 years
ago. This includes the beaver and the
deer, to name a few. We have avoided
the loss of wildlife and wilderness
that has turned much of Europe into
the equivalent of a tame city park.

This same expertise is today being
applied to the issues of trapping and
the balanced and proper manage-
ment of wildlife. We would do well to

‘Ranch Fur’ Cruelties
To the Editor:

While I concur wholeheartedly with,

John B. Oakes’s condemnation of the
steel-jaw leghold trap to capture fur-
bearing animals, the other heinous

side of the fur industry was excluded.
This is the euphemistically termed
“ranch” fur.

The cruelty involved is only mar-
ginally less than that in trapping. The
animals are kept in small cages that
do not meet their behavioral or psy-
chological needs. Conditions are often
crude and filthy, since there are no
laws governing “fur farms.” Al-
though most are killed before they
are a year old, some remain as breed-
ers and may live in virtual isolation
for many years.

When the time comes for killing
these unfortunate creatures, the
cheapest methods are chosen, such as

suffocation, drowning, asphyxia with

crude carbon monoxide chambers,
electrocution or strangulation. This is
just a brief glimpse of the torment
and suffering endured by these
caged, but wild, animals just to pro-
vide a status symbol.
The fur industry is now engaged in
a massive campaign that is aimed at
cleaning up its image and is trying to
convince the uninformed public that
it is an “industry in harmony with na—
ture.” Apart from being patently
false, this also denies the moral and
ethical concern that I, and many
others, have. Namely, how can we
consider ourselves a civilized society
while we torture and kill millions of
innocent animals every year for no
reason other than sheer vanity? How
can one look at a fur coat and not see
the blood on it? Shame on you, fur-
COat wearers. LOUISE SIMMONS

Study tests designs
for humane traps

By Hugh Westrup

TEAM of government scien-

tists has been carefully
watching mink, marten and rac-
coons on, camera in an effort to
develop more humane ways of
trapping fur-bearing animals.

At a research station in Vegre-
ville, Alta., 100 kilometres east of
Edmonton, wild animals are kept
in large pens where fou* video
cameras monitor their every move
day and night.

The pens are built to look like a
real wilderness area to encourage
the animals to act naturally. Once
the animals are comfortable in
their pen, the scientists study their
behavior, watching them as they
approach traps set up in the pen.
(The traps are not rigged to go off.)

By watching the animals as they
approach the traps and poke
around inside, the scientists can
tell whether the traps will kill the
animals properly, says Neal Jo-
tham, of the Canadian Wildlife
Service.

A “humane” trap is one that will
knock an animal unconscious in
less than three minutes, says Jo-
tham, who is overseeing the
project

The most likely trap is one that
the animal approaches head first,
so that the trap brains it or breaks
its neck, rather than seizing its leg
like most current traps (An ani-
mal struggling in a leg-hold can re-
main conscious for five hours.)

This year, scientists working on

the project have been testing three
traps for catching marten at the
Vegreville station. In the fall, these
traps will be ready to be set on real
traplines in the Canadian wilder-
ness

“You have to set up a marten
trap in a box high up in the limb of,
a tree,” he said. “Inside the box,
you put a piece of rabbit or beaver
carcass to lure the marten. Also,
the door of the trap must be cover-
ed in pine boughs so birds can’t get
In.”

When marten are caught, their
bodies will be taken back to labora-
tories and inspected to see if the
traps really did work as they were
supposed to.

If all goes well and the traps
work, man years of experimenta-
tion are a cad, testing traps for
other animals, Jotham says. “I
imagine that we will soon test for
red fox, lynx, raccoon and squir-
re ” he said.

In 1984, 3.4 million animals were
trapped in Canada, including 500,-
000 red squirrel, 150,000 mink and
150,000 marten. The fur trade and
spinoff industries generate $600
(million a year in business for Cana-

a.
The humane-trap study has been
sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife
Service, the Department of Indian
Affairs and Northern Develop-
ment, the Department of External
Affairs and the International Fur

Trade Federation.

Government urged
to defend trappers

Canadian Press
1————.—_

\

. The federal Government, espe-
cially the External Affairs Depart-
ment, must take a public stand
against animal-rights organizations
and defend Canada’s trappers and
fur industry, the Commons aborigi-
pal affairs committee says.

~ Overseas External Affairs staff
1‘ha‘ve been instructed to exercise
caution in handling the (trapping)
issue to avoid giving it undue promi-
nence and thereby making Canada
a focus of controversy,” committee
MP5 said in singling out the depart-
ment for their most biting criticism
in a report released yesterday.

1 The committee said External
Affairs is not living up to its respon-
sibility to promote Canada’s inter-
national image and trade opportuni-
ties when it comes to protecting the
interests of the $600-million-a-year
fur indusi ry.

' “The animaLrights strategy is to

eliminate the consumer market for
fur products,” the report said. “Ca-
nada is particularly vulnerable to
these international campaigns be-
cause more than 90 per cent of the
four million wild fur pelts trapped in
Canada annually and about 50 per
cent of finished fur garments are
exported.”

A Toronto animal-rights activist
accused the committee of encourag-
ing Ottawa to polarize the trapping
issue.

“There is no consideration, for
example, that the fur industry
might not be the very best thing for
the native people or that the moral
concerns (about trapping) . . . are
worthy of being addressed,” Barry
MacKay, wildlife co-ordinator for
the Toronto Humane Society, said
yesterday.

IAN/FEB 1987
DOES BRUTAL TREATMENT or ANIMALS lead
to aggressive behavior in human beings?
The answer is a deﬁnitive "yes", according
to Drs. Stephen Kellert of Yale University
and Alan Felthous of the University of
Texas. These two researchers conducted
a ground-breaking study showing that
the case histories of many aggressive
criminals contain significant evidence of
childhood animal abuse. The study was
initiated by the World Society for the Pro-
tection of Animals and funded through
the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation. In
the study’s sample, 25 per cent of ag-
gressive criminals had abused animals
five or more times in childhood, as op-
posed to approximately six per cent of
nonaggressive criminals and zero per cent
for noncriminals. Interestingly, a number
of animal abusers also admitted to being
hunters or trappers. The findings make
a compelling argument for humane
education of children, and for early iden-
tification of animal abusers as potential
perpetrators of violence against humans.

Idea of Bambi burgers
makes hunters siZzle

BY KEVIN COX
The Globe and Mail

CALGARY

The idea of Bambi being raised
behind barbed wire for burgers has
put the Alberta Government on the
receiving end of the wrath of the
province’s hunters and hikers.

For the second time in less than
two years, the province has issued a
discussion paper that speaks in
glowing terms of the economic
opportunities farmers would have if
game ranching -— the raising of elk,
moose, deer and other species in
fenced pastures — were allowed.

 

; C' 86 He said the cat got into a ﬁght with the musher‘s dogs, so the musher

-iubbed it and then reported the incident to a conservation officer

Later conservation ofﬁcer Dan Drummond snowmobiled to the site and
found the lynx gone, but determined from evidence at the site it had been
held in the trap for a considerable length of time before being dragged away

by a wolverine.

Benda said it was determined, after talking to Bill, that the trapline was

not checked between March 3 to 15.

“The regulations say they must be checked every ﬁve days. Needless to
say, failure to do so leads to needless suffering of animals,” Benda said.

He added for moral reasons, and especiallybecause of the international
anti-trapping movement, Yukon trappers must be very diligent in checking

their traplines.

Defence lawyer Dave Joe said Bill and Sam — both members of the
Kwanlin Dun Indian Band — have a basically subsistence lifestyle and
depend on hunting, trapping and ﬁshing to survive. At the time of the
offence, Joe said Bill was ill with asthma and could not make it out to check

his end of the the trapline.

"Both realize they should have advised one of their friends to check tht‘

line during that time,” Joe said.

Under provincial laws, wild game
(except for buffalo, now raised in a
few feedlots) cannot be sold for
meat. Officers from the Depart-
ment of Forestry, Lands and Wild-
life spend much of their time trying
to control poaching of sheep, deer
and elk in the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains. _

But elk steaks and cuts of caribou
would be sold on butchers’ shelves
next to pork chops if the scenario
outlined in the discussion paper
released by Forestry and Wildlife
Minister Donald Sparrow and Agri-
culture Minister Peter Elzinga last
week comes to pass.

The paper says game ranching is
widely supported by farmers and
native groups.

“Live elk are currently worth
$3,000 to $5,000 (a market-weight
beef animal is worth between $800
and $1,000) and antlers bring about
$120 per kilogram,” the report says.
Antlers from reindeer, caribou and
moose are often ground up and sold
in the Orient.

But the idea of wildlife being
priced as a commodity is repugnant
to Lyle Fullerton, executive direc-
tor of the Alberta Fish and Game
Association.

He said that if game ranching
legislation is passed, farmers would
be able to capture breeding stock
such as elk (for a fee of about $200 a
head) and further reduce the herd
of 15,000 elk in the province, which
he said already presents slim pick~
ings for hunters.

Jay Litke, executive assistant to
Mr. Sparrow, said the Government
has produced the discussion paper
only to find out public sentiment on
the issue.

Dianne Pachal,‘ executive direc-
tor of the Alberta Wilderness Asso-
ciation, the province’s largest envi-
ronmental group, said wild animals

should never be placed in captivity.

Benda noted that though the maximum ﬁne for the offence is $1 ,000. that
he was only asking for a $100 because it was a ﬁrst offence for Sam and Bill

Sweden approaches Soviets

for unfoinied reindeer meoiL as Christmas

BY STEPHEN STRAUSS
The Globe and Mail

GAVLE. Sweden '

With its own reindeer herds badly
contaminated by radiation originat~
ing in the Soviet Ukraine, Sweden is
looking to an unlikely replacement
source — the Soviet Union.

Swedish ' slaughterhouses have
applied to the Government for the
right to " import 15,000 frozen rein-
deer carcasses from an area in the
Soviet Union near the Finnish bor-
der.

Sweden slaughters about 75,000
reindeer a year. But fallout from an
explosion at the nuclear power sta-
tion at Chernobyl in Ukraine has
made lichen -— the main winter food
source for reindeer -- extremely

 

radioactive.

As a result, some of this year’s
reindeer kill are so contaminated
that they will be either fed to foxes
and minks, or destroyed.

“But we want to protect the
market for reindeer meat,” said
Bengt Ekendahl, head of the rein-
deer section of the Swedish national
board of agriculture. “We don’t
want people to lose the habit of eat-
ing reindeer.”

Mr. Ekendahl, who has just’ re-
turned from an inspection tour of
Soviet reindeer areas, said that the
Soviet animals are free from con-
tamination because prevailing

winds did not blow Chemobyl’s ra-
dioactive clouds in. their direction,

 

(continued)

so it Will take a generation for the concen-
tration of radioactivity in native Lapp foods

to decrease by half.

The radioactive products generated by

nuclear weapons testing and power plant
accidents have contaminated the food sup-
ply of wildlife and people in many regions of
the world. Though their potential to cause
premature death from radioactive fallout is
alarming, it is minor in comparison with the
potential from nuclear war.

A military explosion of the smallest nu-
clear weapon would be equal to three Cher-
nobyl disasters, according to A. M. Petro-
syants, chairman of the Soviet Union’s State
Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic
Energy. However, the accident at Chemo-
byl released less than 4 per cent of the total
inventory of radioisotopes contained in just
one of the four reactors. One wartime strat-
egy is to knock out major power plants, so a
deliberate attack on Chernobyl would re-
lease more than 100 times the radioactivity
. that escaped during the accident.

The radioactive contamination following
the explosion of just a few nuclear bombs.
particularly if they hit nuclear power
plants, will be catastrophic. It will jeopar
dize friend and foe alike, and the plant and
animal system that everyone depends on for
survival.

All not well with reindeer

Among the myths and traditions
of Christmas, one of the more en-
chanting is that of the eight tiny
reindeer who pull Santa’s sleigh.
Reindeer images abound this sea-
son and the cute quadrupeds ap-
pear to be beloved by all. But, as
we enter the season when thoughts
dwell upon reindeer, real reindeer
are very much in the news, and the
news is not good.

The reindeer is found around the
northern hemisphere and in North
America is called the caribou. It is
the domesticated, Old World cari-
bou that is usually referred to as
reindeer, although all are forms of
the same species.

Scientists divide the caribou into
a variety of subspecies. One of the
most distinctive was Dawson’s
caribou, a small race found only on
Graham Island, in the Queen Char-
lotte Islands of British Columbia.
The Dawson’s caribou was extinct
by about 1910.

Closest in appearance (and in its
proximity to the North Pole) to
Santa’s reindeer is the small, pale
Peary caribou, of the high Arctic.

Peary caribou numbers declined
drastically in the Canadian Arctic
from an estimated 25,000 in 1961
to an estimated 2,600 in 1974,
bringing the advisory Canadian
Committee on the Status of Endan-
gered Wildlife in Canada to list
Peary caribou as officially “threat-
ened” in 1979. In 1985 (one does not
perceive a sense of urgency) the
government instigated the three-
year survey whose preliminary
findings indicate there are precari-
ously few Peary caribou left in the
world.

Long before the Chernobyl nu-
clear disaster it was known that
radioactive fallout from nuclear
testing concentrates in lichens, one
of the mainstays in the reindeer
diet, and that Inuit who eat cari-
bou have been found to have radio-

active compounds in their bodies

Not surprisingly, the Chernobyl
disaster will probably wipe out the
La lander reindeer industry.

ernobyl has been cited as a
possible cause of a recent mysteri-
ous die-off of about 30,000 caribou
in Labrador and northern Quebec.

The Inuit of the region have been
fighting to prevent the establish-
ment of a NORAD base in Labra-
dor, and the low-flying military

However it would seem radia-
tion levels from the Chernobyl
accident couldn’t possibly be high
enough to cause the mass deaths,
and authorities say the deaths have
not occurred along the routes of

al and International Land Conser-
vation Act has been touted by opti-
mists as a classic example of the
kind of international co-operation
possible for the protection of
species which cross international
borders.

The Porcupine Herd is the
world’s largest caribou herd. The
animals calve 1n Alaska and winter
in the Yukon and the Northwest
Territories.

Legislation is supposed to pro-
vide international management of
this shared resource, but although
the act calls for Canadian consulta-
tion on American decisions affect-
ing the Porcupine Herd, there was

 

 

 

no such consultation when the US.-

approaches

Department of the Interior pm-
posed that the l. 5-mi11ion-acre
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in
Alaska be opened to oil extraction
development.

Noting that the Forty Mile Herd,
located to the south of the Porch:
pine Herd and almost exclusively
in Alaska, was reduced from 500,-

‘ 000 to 20,000 by the effects of hunt-

ing and the encroachment of
human settlement and industry,
conservationists are outraged by
the proposed development. .. '
Even when we try to help the
reindeer we hurt them. The ill'coh-
ceived plan of placing 27 caribou
from Newfoundland into the Woods
of Maine reportedly has resUlted in
the deaths of about a third of the
animals involved. Other trans-
plants have resulted in failures,
and no one is sure why. _ A _

A possible factor in caribou
transplant failures could be the ac-
tivity of Parelaphostrongylus te-
nuis, a parasitic worm that infects,
but does not kill the white-tailed
deer but can be deadly to moose
and caribou, causing them to die 1n
agony.

There is a related parasite found
only in Eurasia and Newfoundland.
It was a Jarently inadvertantly
transport to Newfoundland in a
shipment of reindeer brought
there by Grenfell early in this ceno
tury.

The irony of our giving caribou
to Maine, where they were previ.
ously wiped out and where the peo-
ple don’t need them while the
Americans are threatening the
safety of the Porcupine Herd upon
which native Canadians depend, is
a bitter irony, indeed.

The food chain
putin peril
frOm fallout

BY PAUL AIRD

Mr. Aird is professor of forest policy at the Univer-
sity of Toronto. ,

THE GLOBE AND MAIL, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 14. 1986

 

 

THE EARLY 19503, newspapers
published the first accounts of
finding insecticides in the fatty
tissues of Antarctic penguins.
At the time, it seemed laughable. How could
industrial chemicals drift so far and accu-
mulate in the penguins’ food chain? Surely
the research scientist had made a mistake.

 

Tending to the drying of caribou meat in; camp in northern Canada.

 

 

Of course, there had been no mistake. It
soon became apparent that airborne pollu-
tants can drift long distances, in solid, liq-
uid or gaseous form, and encircle the globe.

More recently, the accident at the Cher-
nobyl reactor in the Ukraine proved once
again that the world is one vast biosphere

' with many interrelated parts. The radioiso-

topes released from a few tonnes of urani-

um fuel have diffused into the cellular tis-

sues of plants and animals around the
world. This occurred within just a few.
weeks, and without respect for national or
natural boundaries.

Nature revolts against radioactive intru-
sions by increasing the incidence of cancer,
leukemia and genetic defects. That airborne
pollutants can enter the food chain and
present a risk to wildlife and humans be-
came evident when atomic bombs were still
being tested above ground. Radioactive fall-
out from tests conducted in the South Pacif.
ic and Siberia was found widely distributed
throughout ‘the world.

North American newspapers often carried
reports _on the concentrations of the radio-
isotope strontium-90 in milk and in the teeth
of young children. This alarmed some par-

_ ents and they stopped serving milk. They

did not realize that milk is used to test for
radioactivity because it is the only food that
can be sampled throughout the world in any
month of the year. They did not understand
that fallout accumulates in all food grown
outdoors, not just in cattle fodder.
Above-ground nuclear tests were finally

banned in 1963. Eight years later, the Gov.

ernment of Canada prepared a report for
the Stockholm Conference on the Environ-
ment, organized by the United Nations;
Conspicuous by its absence from the draft
report’s agricultural and forestry section
was any reference to the excessive amounts

in Canada’s boreal forests and tundra.

The results .of Govemment-sponsored
research on the radioactive contamination
of northern Canada merited greater distri-
bution, and. a strong case was required to
maintain the ban against testing nuclear

weapons in the atmosphere. As a result, the

final report contained a section entitled
Radioactive Cesium in the Canadian North
that outlined the special food-chain relation-
ships among radioactive fallout, lichens,
caribou and humans. Lichens are slow.
growing plants that absorb much of their
nutrition from the rain and dust falling on
them. Radioactive fallout therefore accu-
mulates to a higher concentration in lichens
than in many other plants, and certain li-

The concentration of radioactive cesium
in the atmOSphere fell to low levels after the
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. But be-
cause of the previous accumulation in li-
chens. and caribou, the risk to humans eat-
ing caribou meat continued. From 1965'to

.1969, annual surveys to determine the

human body contents of cesium-137 in Inuit
in 25 northern communities detected levels
20 to 100 times those of people living in the
south. In some cases, the content exceeded
the safe limit suggested by the International
Commission on RadiOlogical Protection, so
the Government’s report counselled that
“international agreements to control the
release of radioactive materials to the
atmosphere are regarded by Canada as
being both necessary and effective.”

Nuclear power plants may also make a
significant contribution to radioactive fall-
out. The accident at Chernobyl killed 31
people and injured hundreds, but its fallout
is expected to cause the premature death of
thousands, chiefly from diseases initiated
by eating contaminated food.

The Canadian situation is under investi-
gation by the Department of Health and
Welfare. Although recent data are not yet
available, information collected before
Chernobyl suggests that the normal activity
of radionuclides in beef was less than five
becquerels per kilogram, while in caribou
meat, it was often between 100 and 200. This
high background level of radioactivity in
caribou, augmented by the new fallout from
Chernobyl, could cause the radioactivity of
caribou meat to rise significantly in some
regions of Canada, but perhaps not above
the so-called safe level of 300 becquerels per
kilogram. Contrary to some press coverage,
however, the radioactive cesium released at

Chernobyl amounts to perhaps one-tenth the

total of all atmospheric tests and bombs -—
not 50 per cent more than this total, as was
widely reported.

_The caribou of northern Canada and rein-
deer in northern Europe are members of
the same species. Swedish and Norwegian
health authorities recently analyzed rein-
deer meat and reported radiation levels
eight to 80 times above normal. The con-
tamination of reindeer was sporadic, de-
pending on the amount of rainfall when the
radioactive cloud passed. In a region of 54
Lapp villages, 30 showed only traces of ra-
dioactivity while residents of the remaining
24 were forbidden to eat or sell reindeer
meat.

Contamination from cesium-137 now
threatens the lives and livelihood of Lapp"
living 2,000. kilometres from Chernobyl.
Cesium-137 has a half-life of about 30 years.

Chernobyl May—Cause
4,000 European Deaths

 

By Michael Weisskopf
and R. Jeffrey Smith

Washington Post Staff Writers

 

The Chernobyl nuclear reactor
accident last year may eventually
cause up to 4,000 cancer deaths in
Europe, or doublesome previously
published estimates, according to
new projections in a draft report
from a U.S. government task force.

The report also estimated for the
first time that the accident last Ap-
ril may have caused mental retaro
dation in up to 300 newborn babies
in the Soviet Union, and it affirmed
that the release of radiation from
the Chernobyl explosion and fire
may cause up to 10,320 cancer
deaths in the Soviet Union over 70
years. Thirty-one deaths have been
reported thus far.

The report, to be discussed today
at a meeting of the Nuclear Regu-
latory Commission (NRC), indicates
that even 10 months after the ac-
cident, considerable uncertainty
remains about its impact on health
and the environment.

But NRC officials said yesterday
that the figures represent the US.
government’s best assessment to
date of the long—term health toll
from the disaster.

Harold R. Denton, director of the
NRC nuclear regulation office and
chairman of the interagency group
that prepared the report, said it
would be distributed for public com-
ment in the United States and else-
where. “We hope the Soviets fill in
some gaps” of information, Denton
said, particularly on the exact ra-
diation dose rates received by pow-
er plant workers and nearby resi-
dents.

Western specialists analyzing a

report on the accident released by
the Soviets last August projected
that 2,000 cancer deaths related to
Chernobyl might occur in Western
Europe in the next 70 years.

But the new draft report, in a
chapter prepared by the Environ-
mental Protection Agency, said that
“4,000 excess cancer deaths out-
side the Soviet Union may be cal-
culated to result from the accident.”

The fatality estimates are based
on assumptions about radiation that
were made by a panel of US. sci-
entists in 1980, the report said.
“Others might recommend a risk
factor that is up to three times high-
er or lower,” it added.

The estimate of 300 Soviet new-
borns with radiation-induced wrh
defects such as mental retardation
assumes that no “therapeutic abor-
tions” were performed, the report
said. The estimate was based on
data obtained after the 1945 atomic
bomb blasts in Japan.

Initial estimates of long-term
cancer deaths from the Chernobyl
accident varied widely because of
uncertainty about the resulting ra—
diation exposure of Soviet and Eu—
ropean citizens. Data published by
the Soviet Union last fall led some
experts to expect as many as
40,000 deaths due to long-term
radioactive contamination of the
food supply.

But the report indicated general
agreement among US. experts
“that the estimated collective dose
given in the [Soviet] report was
probably too high,” and may have
considerably overstated the risks.

Pedi'znon reaching the United
St...es after the accident was “gen-
erally lower” than in Europe, and
only two cases of thyroid cancer
will probably result, the report said

PCB pollution lands Britain in court
HE EUROPEAN Commission is _-
taking Britain to court over allegations

that pollution from polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) from a Welsh incinerator
may be causing deaths and deformities
among farm animals. It also intends to
strengthen an EEC environmental directive
covering the disposal of PCBs and poly-
chlorinated terphenyls.

The first step in the proceedings, which
could land the British government in the
European Court of Justice, were revealed
last week in Strasbourg by the EEC’s envi-
ronment commissioner, Stanley Clinton
Davis.

He said there was prima—facie evidence
of pollution by an incinerator run by
ReChem International in Torfaen, near
Pontypool, and he is writing to the British
government about its failure to implement
an existing directive passed by Europe’s
environment ministers in 1976.

Clinton Davis said: “The government has
been given the opportunity to investigate
the matter. If the government produces
convincing opinion [that] our scientists’
opinion is incorrect, we would not act
further in the matter.”

The row arises from a complaint from a

' Welsh farmer who alleges that some of his

 

cattle were born with deformities caused by
pollution by PCBs. There are strict rules
concerning disposal of PCBs, which are
found in electric transformers and batteries.
They are toxic and do not degrade in the
env1ronment.

PCBs are normally disposed of by incin-
eration at high temperatures in plants such
as that run by ReChem. If temperatures in
the incinerator are too low, dioxins may be
produced. Two years ago, the Welsh Ofﬁce
published a report which dismissed claims
that there was a high incidence of certain
genetic disorders around Torfaen.

But the complaints of farmers have been
pursued by Llewellyn Smith. the Labour
MEP for Southeast Wales. A similar
complaint about another high-temperature
incinerator at Bonnybridge in Scotland,
which has now closed, has not been pursued
by Clinton Davis.

Britain is to be sued for failing to abide by
a directive which requires that PCBs “must
be safely disposed of” because they
“endanger human health and harm the
environment”. Following a review of coun-
tries’ practical experience the measure is to
be tightened up. D

Soviets linked to Arctic haze

Half to three-quarters of a dusky haze over the Arc-
tic comes from the Soviet Union, a chemist who has
developed a means of identifying the origin of the air

pollution says.

Atmospheric chemist Kenneth Rahn measured the
concentrations of seven elements commonly produced
by industrial processes. He then compared these read-
ings to known regional chemical fingerprints —— precise
measurements of the trace elements that an industrial
region adds to the atmosphere. With this method, he
was able to confirm earlier estimates that most of the
Arctic haze is of Soviet origin.

The University of Rhode Island chemist says that
once his system is refined, it could play an important
part in international efforts to stem air pollution. “If
you can demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that
pollution in your country comes from another country,
you have every right to complain,” he said.

Scientists still rely on mapping air currents to pin-
point the probable origin of polluted air masses, but
Mr. Rahn says the reliability of this method fades rap-
idly after two or three days as it becomes too difficult
to backtrack an air mass.

Leh-of-Center Coalition
Collapses in West Germany

By a WALL STREET JOURNAL Staff Reporter

BONN. West Germany—A regional
alliance between West Germany’s Social
Democratic Party and the environmen-
talist Greens collapsed over disagree-
ment about nuclear power. It was a set-
back for possible left-of-center coopera-
tion on the national level.

The coalition, formed 14 months ago
in the prosperous industrial state of
Hesse, was split over several environ-
mental issues. It finally foundered over
a quarrel about the Alkem nuclear plant
at Hanau in Hesse. The plant produces
nuclear fuel rods.

The antinuclear Greens' Joschka Fi-
scher, Hesse’s minister for the environ-

ment and energy, tea opposrtron to the
plant. At a party convention this past
weekend. he promised to resign and pull
the Greens from the coalition unless the
Social Democrats agreed to close Al-
kem.

But Hesse’s governor. Social Demo

s crat Holger Boerner, said in a letter to

Mr. Fischer yesterday that he accepted
the resignation offer. He said his party
wouldn't sacrifice the 500 jobs at the
plant.

Mr. Boerner's decision came after
the Social Democrat-run Hesse Econom-
ics Ministry decided to reissue a short-
term permit to Alkem allowing it to
work with highly radioactive plutonium.
The decision essentially overturned a
Social Democrat-Green coalition agree-
ment for a moratorium on plutonium en-
richment at the plant.

By PHILIP M. BOFFEY
Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 —— The Nu-
clear Regulatory Commission staff’s
proposal to relax the requirements for
emergency evacuation planning at nu-
clear plants was driven by frustration
that plants were being stopped by in-
transigent state and local officials
after billions had been spent on their
construction, officials said today.

The lever used by local officials,
commission staff members said, was
to refuse to cooperate in developing
emergency plans to evacuate citizens
within a radius of up to 10 miles in the
event of a severe nuclear accident.
Suchevacuation plans have thus far
been considered a prerequisite to ob-
taining a license from the commission
to operate the plant.

But a proposal submitted to the com-
mission today by its staff warns that, if
state and local governments refuse to
cooperate in emergency planning, the
consequences might be “severe" for
both utilities and taxpayers.

The staff, proposal contends that
,“questions of equity and fairness" are
{raised when a utility has committed
”substantial resources to a nuclear
:plant and then, after it is far too late
irealistically for the utility to reverse
“course, the state or local government
opposes the plant by noncooperation in
offsite emergency planning.”

It adds: “A forced abandonment of a
completed nuclear plant for which bil-
lions of dollars have been invested also

 

 

 

The proposal is
designed to force
local officials to
cooperate

 

poses obvious serious financial conse-
quences to the utility, ratepayers, and
taxpayers.”

Victor Stello, executive director for
operations at the regulatory commis-
sion, said that the problem of state and
local refusal to participate in emer-
gency planning “has been building
momentum over a period of time.” The
two clearest examples, he said, were in
New York, where local and state offi—
cials have opposed the Shoreham nu-
clear power plant on Long Island, and
New England, where the state of Mas-
sachusetts is refusing to cooperate in
evacuation planning for the Seabrook
nuclear power plant in nearby New
Hampshire. But the issue “was start—
ing to get raised” in Ohio and other
states as well, he said.

The new proposal is designed to force
local officials to cooperate; it assumes
that once a nuclear plant is in full
operation, local officials will recognize
either that they should develop and test
their own evacuation plans or be will-
ing in an emergency to pitch in and
help save their citizens by following a
plan already approved by the commis-
SIG“.

However, Peter Bradford, a former
commissioner of the regulatory com-
mission, currently the chairman of
Maine’s public utilities commission,
called it “a serious mistake" for the
commission to try to override the state
and local authorities because that will
“only further disenchant the public
with nuclear power.”

Years ago proposals were made that
emergency planning be considered at

the construction phase, he said, but the '

utilities and the regulatory commission
“fought tooth and nail and rejected it”
on the theory that if a plant was built
first, it would be much harder to block
it on the grounds of inadequate emer-
gency plans.

In circumstances where the local au-
thorities initially refuse to cooperate,
the staff proposal would allow the com-'
mission to grant an operating license
as long as the utility showed “a good-
faith and sustained effort” to gain local
cooperation, developed reasonable
plans to compensate for the lack of
cooperation, and provided copies of
those plans to all relevant govern-
ments should they want to cooperate in
the future.

Such evacuation plans would be less
effective without. local government
cooperation, Mr._ Stello acknowledged.
“They will still be OK. but clearly not*
as good as if there was cooperation,”
he said. -

that the utility can develop its own
plans provided they are “generally
comparable” with what might be ac-

Mr. Stello said he thought the pro-

 

the approach the commission was tak-
ing in the Shoreham case, but James K.
Asselstine one of the five members of
the commission, said the new proposal
appeared to represent “a fundamental
change” that would reduce the testing
of emergency plans even beyond what
is being contemplated with Shoreham.
However, other commissioners are
said to favor the new proposal.

Mr Stello said he expected the five-
member commission to issue the pro-
posal for comment by all concerned
'but declined to speculate on whether
the commission would ultimately en-
dorse it.

The general counsel of the commis-
sion has judged that there is “no legal
impediment” that would prevent the
commission from establishing the new
apolicy. Moreover, a law passed by Con-
gress after the nuclear accident at
Three Mile Island in 1979 said that. the
commission could grant operating li-
censes, even without approved local
emergency plans, if a utility’s own
emergency plans provided “reason-
able assurance” of public safety. The
issue of what is reasonable might have
to be settled in the courts, Congres-

sional observers say.

Scott Peters, a spokesman for the
Atomic Industrial Forum, an industry
trade group, said his organization
favors the proposed change “because it
is a shame to let plants that are 99 per
cent finished just sit there and go to
waste.”

However, Ellyn Weiss, general coun-
sel for the Union of Concerned Scien-
tists, a group concerned about nuclear
safety issues, complained that “what
they are proposing is the functional
equivalent of doing away with emer-
gency planning. The gremlins of the
NRC. don’t have the guts to say we
don’t want emergency planning, so
they are exploring other ways to
achieve that without saying it.”

US. Rebuffs Treaty for Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone

ma?

French Objections, Administration Dislike ofAntiatomic Feeling Cited; Sharp Australian Criticism Expected

 

By Don Oberdorfer

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

The Reagan administration, bow-
ing to objections from the French
and reflecting its dislike of antinu-
clear sentiments, announced yes-
terday it will not sign a treaty
worked out by 13 Pacific nations to
create a nuclear-free zone in the
South Pacific.

The decision, announced by the
State Department after three
months of internal deliberations, is
likely to draw heavy criticism in the
Pacific, especially from Australia,
the chief US. ally in the affected

prodding, the pact was carefully
drawn in a way that did not inter-
fere with ongoing US. military ac-
tivities, such as the passage of nu-
clear warships.

The Soviet Union, following a
statement from Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, signed the trea-
ty Dec. 15. China, which is the third
Asian nuclear power, plans to sign it
next week, according to reports
from the area.

In view of Moscow’s adherence,
said Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-
N.Y.), chairman of the House For-
eign Affairs subcommittee on Asia

hands the Soviet Union a “propa-
ganda bonanza of immense propor-
tions” and makes the United States
“appear insensitive to the very real
concerns of the nations involved.”

State Department spokesman
Charles E. Redman said that US.
“practices and activities” in the Pa-
cific are “not inconsistent” with the
treaty. He attributed the US. re-
fusal to sign to “our global security
interests and responsibilities.”

A senior Defense Department
official said the strong opposition of
France was a major element in the
US. decision. Continued French

Cuomo’s Aide Angered

“I’ve never seen such an utter lack of
concern for the safety and health of
people around nuclear plants as is em-
bodied in this proposal,” he said. “If
the commission were even to entertain
such an idea, it would be a shameless
act and a total abandonment of any
sense of responsibility by them.”

At the Capitol, releasing what he said
was the text of the proposed rule

‘change, Mr. Markey, who has joined
I Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachu-
: setts in an effort to block the licensing
' of the Seabrook-plant in southern New
Hampshire, said the rule change
“would allow the commission to tram-
ple on the well-grounded concerns ex-
pressed by governors and local com-
munities” not satisfied with plans for
emergency evacuations.

The memorandum described the

and the Pacific, the US. action

 

' staff proposal as “a far less drastic ap-
proach” to an emergency planning im—
passe than the request filed with the
commission by the Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, opera-
tors of the Seabrook plant, to simply
shrink the circumference of the re-
quired evacuation zone from In miles
to I mile. The commission has not ye:
ruled on whether it will entertain such
a proposal.

 

 

According to Mr. Markey, the staff
memorandum proposed that the com-
mission could grant a full-power oper:
ating license if the applicant, a nuclear
utility such as the Long Island Lighting
Company, the owner of ,Shoreham,
“demonstrates to the commission’s
satisfaction” that several safety condi-
tions have been met.

Herbert H. Brown, a lawyer here rep-
resenting Suffolk County in the Shore-
ham dispute, said he did not think the
rule change would affect the Shoreham
impasse, in which the county has con-
ducted a $600,000 study of plans to
evacuate more than 100,000 people over
crowded highways and, as he put .it,
“found that it cannot be done.” ,

“There has been a responsible deter-
mination by Suffolk County that an
emergency evacuation isn’t possible,”
he said. “That was a not recalcitran’ce
or obstructionism but a proper exer-
cise of the police power of the county
and it has been upheld by the United
States District Court as proper.” ,

That decision is being appealed by
Lilco.

The commission has instructed the
hearing board considering the Shore-
ham planning impasse to “assume”
that in an emergency local fire and po-
lice authorities would respond.

nuc‘ea" weapons testing in the

South Pacific, which is seen by Pa-
cific island nations as endangering
their environment, was the driving
force behind the treaty.

“Much of the ardor is directed
against French testing, which
makes them [the French] able to
participate as part of the deterrent”
of the West against the Soviet bloc,
the official said in explaining this
aspect of the US. decision.

Another factor cited by the Pen-
tagon is an aversion to the spread of
“nuclear-free zone” proposals gen-
erally, on grounds that they inhibit
US. military actiVities much more
than they would inhibit thr- Soviets.

According to defense officials, any
restrictions can have serious effects
because the US. Navy is about 40
percent nuclear-armed and the pro-
portion is growing.

In the past, the United States
supported creating three nuclear-
free zones, in Latin America, Ant-
arctica and the ocean seabed. At
the United Nations and elsewhere,
the United States continues to sup-
port the concept of nuclear-free
zones in South Asia and the Middle
East.

After the US. decision was made
known to allies but before it was
officially announced, Australian
Foreign Minister Bill Hayden
votced criticism, saying that, the
treaty did not compromise Western
security interests and that the Unit-
ed States should not take Pacific
nations for granted.

The South Pacific Nuclear Free
Zone Treaty (sometimes known as
Spinfizz) was sponsored by the
South Pacific Forum, a group of 13
nations of the region including Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and the Pacific
ministates of Western Samoa, Tu-
valu, Niue, Fiji, the Cook Islands,
Kiribati, Tonga, Papua New Guinea,
Vanuatu, Nauru and the Solomon
Islands.

The treaty nations asked the five
major nuclear powers to sign “pro~
tocols” of association with the trea-
ty that would forbid nuclear testing
anywhere in the area and pledge
the nuclear powers not to use or

Tbxic Fog Containing Farm Chemicals TWP

 

. May Be Harmi

By Boyce Rensberger

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

Scientists have found that toxic fog,
made up of microscopic water droplets
containing unexpectedly high concentra—
tions of pesticides, herbicides and many
' other chemicals, forms over at least some
parts of the United States. .

The scientists say that the fog may be
among the causes of a mysterious decline
of forests in the United States and Eu-
rope. They say that the chemical—laden
fog, which was sampled in Beltsville, Md.,
and in California’s San Joaquin Valley,
could prove to be more of a health hazard
than the air in which the fog forms. As yet,
however, there is no evidence of human
disease caused by the fog.

Writing in today’s issue of Nature, the

researchers say they have found that the
fog samples bear concentrations of some
toxic substances that are thousands of
' times higher than had been predicted by a
widely used law of chemistry.

The research was done by Louis A. Lil-
jedahl and Dwight E. Glotfelty of the Ag-
riculture Department’s Agricultural Re—
search Service in Beltsville and James N.
Seiber of the University of California at
Davis.

Among the 16 toxic compounds identified
so far are the insecticides diazinon, para«
thion and malathion and the herbicides si-
mazine and alachlor. All were derived from
vapors of agricultural chemicals that atmo‘
spheric chemists have long known were in
the air but which were thought to exist in
tolerably low concentrations. The new re-
search shows, however, that fog droplets
can concentrate the vapors to far higher
levels than exist in the air.

“I think there is a very great potential
for these water-borne organic compounds
to damage crops and forests,” Glotfelty
said. Much of the forest decline seen in
parts 'of the eastern United States and
Western EurOpe has been attributed to
acid rain, but many environmental scien-
tists think that acid rain alone cannot ac-
count for the damage. “It could. easily be
toxic organics,” Glotflety said. '

ng U .S. Forests

The scientists said their findings came
as a surprise because the concentration of
toxic compounds was much higher than
had been predicted using Henry’s Law,
the 184-year-old standard formula for cal—
culating how much of the airborne vapor
of a substance can be dissolved in a liquid.

Henry’s Law assumes that the fog drop-
lets behave as an “ideal solution,” meaning
that the ability of any one vapor to dis-
solve into the droplet is not affected by
any substance already in the droplet.

The new findings suggest that chem-
icals already in the droplet or on its sun
face can make it easier for the droplet to
take up other substances. The phenom‘
enon may be analogous to the way deter—
gents increase water’s ability to dissolve
various substances. _

As a result some toxic vapors consid~
ered nearly insoluble and virtually incapa~
ble of entering a droplet were able to do
so and reach concentrations thousands of
times higher than predicted by Henry's
Law. Some fog samples contained pesti~
cides that could not be detected as a vapor
in the dry air surrounding the droplets.

Acid pollution stalks plans for more British trees

DRAMATIC increase in farmland

forestry is likely in Britain as the
government ponders what to do with
surplus agricultural land which contributes
to Europe’s food mountains.

Government ministers met this week to
decide how to deal with an estimated 1-5
million hectares of farmland, now
employed for livestock and cereal produc—
tion, that could be transferred to other uses
over the next decade.

The trigger for this upheaval in
Britain’s rural land-use is the
recent agreement between EEC
members to reform agricultural
support policies. These have
resulted in grain and butter
mountains, and wine and milk
lakes.

A big switch to farm forestry is
one element of the strategy under
consideration. The National
Farmers Union estimates that
500000 hectares of farmland are
ripe for timber growing.

Commercial forestry is cur-
rently conﬁned largely to poor
quality farmland in upland areas. 3
Large-scale afforestation could
become increasingly important in '
lowland areas where richer soil
and sheltered locations could
produce a valuable timber crop.

But the move comes at a time when
Britain’s public foresters are admitting for
the ﬁrst time that the health both of
conifers and of beech trees in Britain may
be deteriorating.

Air pollution could be to blame. But
researchers at the Forestry Commission say
traditional methods of assessing tree health,
mainly by a variety of observation tech-
niques, are suspect.

Now, the commission has embarked on

Why grow

a ﬁve-year research programme costing
more than £500 000. The aim is to measure
the effects of air pollution scientiﬁcally.
Specially-designed open-topped “green-
houses” have been built at three sites in
England and Scotland. The sites—in mid-
Scotland, Hampshire and Derbyshire—are
representative of the areas of Britain that
are most heavily polluted by nitrogen
oxides, ozone and sulphur dioxide. A total

of 48 “greenhouses” are being built.

The results of the most recent studies of
conifer and beech health have just been
released by the commission. Its survey of
Sitka spruce, Scots pine and Norway spruce
suggests a worsening of tree condition as
indicated by needle loss, though needle life
has remained unchanged compared with
previous assessments.

The commission suspects that an adverse

combine to harm the trees. But “other
factors such as drou t, waterlogging,
exposure, nutrient de lciencies and air
pollution may also be involve ”, it adds.

The survey concludes that the existing
health of British conifers is “only
moderate”. Alarmingly, Britain has appre-
ciably more trees in the slightly and
moderately damaged categories than West
Germany.

The survey of beech trees,
according to the commission,
indicates that most of the rela-
tively small number of woodland
stands observed were in
“moderate to good health”.

But the report notes that
independent assessments by two
West German scientists painted a
contrasting picture. One re-
searcher Klaus Lang, concluded
that Britain does not have a
problem approaching that faced
by Southern Germany. Andreas
Roloff, however, told the
commission that the British trees
were worse than most of those
in Germany. The commission
points out that Roloff’s impres-
sion was more inﬂuenced by
beech trees standing on their own
which, the commission concedes
“are generally in a worse condi-
tion than their woodland counterparts”.
Q A ROW was brewing in Whitehall this
week over the choice of a civil servant with
no experience of pollution control as direc-
tor of the govemment’s new uniﬁed pollu-
tion inspectorate. Brian Ponsford has had a
brief spell as director of waste disposal at
the Department of the Environment, but
until a year ago had spent his career in
ﬁnance and housing. He will head a team of
technically experienced chief inspectors. E]

 

 

 




THE NEW YORK TIMES, MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 1987

 

Canadians Complain Reagan —
Reneges on Acid Rain Funds

 

By JOHN F. BURNS
Special to The New York Times

TORONTO, Jan. 11 — Less than a [that Mr. Reagan’s approach tothe acid

year after President Reagan and
Prime Minister Brian Mulrone signed
an accord on a joint approac to the
problem of acid rain, officials here
have begun questioning whether the
United States is serious about tackling
an issue that has sensitive political
overtones.

New criticism has been spurred by
the allocation of less than $300‘million
to acid rain research in Mr. Reagan’s
$1,024 billion budget for fiscal 1988,
much of it money that was committed

before the two Governments agreed on .

a stepped-up environmental program
last year.

In Canada, where official studies
have attributed 50 percent of environ-

mental damage from rain-home pollu- .

tants to American industries, the allo- ‘

cation has been widely criticized as un-
dercutting the agreement reached by
Mr. Reagan and Mr. Mulroney at a
meeting in Quebec City last March.
In turn, Mr. Mulroney has come

under fresh‘ attack for his handling of l
relations with the United States, which 9

opponents have frequently described
as insufficiently assertive.

$5 Billion Plan Was Agreed On
At the meeting in Quebec City, the

two leaders accepted recommenda--

tions for a five-year, $5 billion program
' by governments and industries on both
sides of the'border that would develop
new technologies to fight acid rain.

At the time, critics here said that Mr.
Mulroney had accepted a nebulous
commitment to further research when
what was needed was an immediate
crackdown on smokestack industries.

On learning of the Reagan budget al-
location, Mr. Mulroney’s chief aide for
pollution matters, Environment Minis-
ter Thomas McMillan, told reporters
that the Government would have to
reassess its approach.

Mr. McMillan was quated as saying

The fog samples were collected with a

rain issue seemed to be “theological,”
meaning not practical, and one that
“doesn’t get us anywhere" — much
what the Government's critics have

been saying all along.

Closer Examination of “at

Mr. McMillan said he would reserve
final judgment until officials had made
a closer examination of the budget,
which allocates the largest part Of the
acid rain money, $199 million, to the
Department of Energy’s program to
develop cleaner ways of burning coal.

Acid rain occurs when oxides of sul-
fur or nitrogen from the burning of fos-
sil fuels combine with moisture in the
atmosphere. Through chemical reac-
tions, nitric or sulfuric acid isiformed
and falls to earth in rain, sleet, snow or
mist. It can also fall in dry form.

 

In the meantime, other political com-

mentators have advised the Govem-l
. ment here to recognize that it was,

duped in the 1986 accord.

Mr. Reagan is put out to pasture.”
Tighter Emission Laws Sought

Michael Perley, executive coordina-
tor of the Canadian Coalition on Acid
Rain, said Ottawa should return to its
insistence, before Mr. Mulroney, that
tighter emission laws be adopted by
the United States. ‘

For the Government, the criticism
comes at an inopportune time. Perhaps
more than at any time in the lastzo
years, political debate in Canada is
centering on relations with the United
States, with mounting charges from

 

the opposition parties that Mr. Mulro-
ney’s Conservatives are leading the
country into an unhealthy dependence

to suck in large volumes of fog and con- .

dense it into jugs of liquid.

Mounted on a pick-up truck, the ex-
tractor was driven through fogs occurring
over agricultural fields at the Agricultural
Research Service’s Beltsville facility
where a wide variety of experimental
crops are grown and in the San Joaquin
Valley where farmers raise cotton, citrus
fruit, grapes and dairy cattle. The use of
insecticides and herbicides is common in
both regions. . ﬂ _

After filtering out dust and other solids,
the scientists found the fog liquids to vary
in color from nearly clear to pale yellow.
All the samples had a “foamy, soapy ap-
pearance” resembling descriptions of the
infamous “killer fogs” of 19th-century Lon-
don. Some were acidic, especially the
Beltsville sample, which registered a pH
of 2.42—almost as acidic as lemon juice.

The scientists say the existence of toxic
compounds in fog is more worrisome than
their existence as vapors in the air be-

surfaces of leaves and lungs, making ab-

sorption far easier than if the vapors sim-v

ply waited by in moving air. As the drop-

lets on leaves dry, they leave an even
‘ more concentrated film of pesticides.

Because many of the dissolved com-

pounds are plant killers, Liljedahl said the ;

findings “give scientists a more solid basis

for attributing low-level crop damage" to'

toxic fag.
Because fog is simply a cloud that forms

at ground level, the researchers said it isw‘

likely that similar mechanisms of pesticide

concentration are occurring in rain clouds.

Tests to confirm this, however, have not

, been done. And it is not known whether"
pesticide vapors at high altitudes are as,

great as they are near ground level.
Although raindrops would carry the
clouds’ pesticide burden to the ground,
they would not be expected to absorb

of these data confirm that exposure to

pollution can produce toxic effects on '

the lungs."

. In response to a question, Dr. Landri-
gan Said that."‘acid rain is probably
third after active smoking and passive
smoking as a cause of lung disease.”

Today’s testimony dealt largely with
health effects of acid rain pollution in
the air, rather than its effects on the
ground or in the water. But Dr. An-
thony Robbins, past president of the
American Public Health Association,
did allude to studies showing that acid
rain leached heavy metals from water
and that these metals then entered the
human food chain.

Christian Rice, a spokesman for the
Environmental Protection Agency,
said that “the agency is cognizant of
the health studies cited in today’s

‘ study," and added: “The national air

quality standards established by the
EPA. are designed to protect against
harmful health effects. The agency by
law periodically reviews the standards
to make sure they achieve that objec-
tive.” '

Ali of the witnesses at today’s hear-
ing said, however, that the current air
quality standards were inadequate to
protect human health and must be
strengthened. ' -

SENATE OVERRlDES
WAEEE BILL VEEO .
BY Eaton vorE

MAJOR REBUFF T0 REAGAN

 

Clearance of New Law Marks
Culmination of Bipartisan
Drive to Cut Pollution

By BERNARD WEINRAUB
Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 —- In a major
rebuff to President Reagan, the Senate
today completed a Congressional over-
ride of his veto of a $20 billion bill to
clean up the nation’s water.

The vote to override was 86 to 14,

 

with 13 Republicans and one Demo-
crat, Senator James J. Exon of Nebras- !
ka, supporting the President’s action.
The lopsided Senate vote marked the
culmination of a broad bipartisan ef-
fort to reduce water pollution across
the nation, an effort that ended in Mr.
Reagan’s first legislative defeat of the
100th Congress Voting to override it

were 54 Democrats and 32 Republi-
cans. The House acted on Tuesday to
override Mr. Reagan’s veto by a vote of
401 to 26. All of the 26 were Republi-
cans.

A two-thirds majority in each house
is necessary to override a veto.

Albert R. Brashear, a White House
spokesman, expressed this reaction to
the Senate vote on the clean water bill:
“We are disappointed. The President’s
position is clear. However, the Senate
has spoken.”

In six years in the White House, Mr.
Reagan has vetoed 61 pieces of legisla—
tion but has been overridden only seven
times. Legislators said that the White
House, which had sought. a less expen-
sive compromise, failed to lobby heav-
ily and virtually acknowledged that the
tide of Congressional opinion would
overwhelm the veto.

Reagan Seen as Vulnerable

Beyond this, however, some legisla-
tprs asserted that the Congressional
vetes underlined Mr. Reagan’s relative
political weakness and vulnerability as
a result of the Iran arms scandal. Veto-
ing the bill, some legislators said, was a

political blunder by the President. Mr.
Reagan.

“This can only hurt him,” remarked
Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of
Oklahoma, shortly after casting his
vote to override. “The fact that he’s
spent so much political capital On this
tends to undermine the President’s
credibility. This was a political mis-
takef’

Even Mr. Reagan’s Republican sup~
porters acknowledged that it was futile
to seek party unity.

The Senate Republican leader, Bob
Dole of Kansas, conceded defeat before
the vote, and said with a shrug, “This is
an opportunity to go on record for defi-
cit reduction.”

“The water quality override vote is a
triumph for the future of America’s

waters,” said Lawrence D. Downing,‘

ipresident of the Sierra Club, an envi-
ronmental group. “It signals that the

100th Congress will not bow to Presi-'

dential pressure when the public health
is endangered.”

The Clean Water Act, which auto-.

matically became law today, provides
$18 billion to help communities build
sewage treatment «facilities through
1994, and $2 billion more for other pro-
grams to clean up the nation’s water
supplies. An Administration version
would have reduced the sewage treat.-
ment. aid to $12 billion.

Because the bill seeks to protect the
environment as well as provide states
with Federal funds for pollution con-
trol, the measure stirred broad support
in Congress.

In an hourlong debate that preceded
the vote, Democrats as well as Republi-
cans criticized Mr. Reagan’s veto of
the clean water measure last Friday on
grounds that it was wasteful and cost-
ly. Legislators said that Mr. Reagan

was out of touch with national priori-
ties, and that Americans desired a
cleaner environment.

The veto, said Senator John H.
Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican
who is an architect of the bill, was “a
serious mistake” because the measure
was “fiscally responsible and lives up

 

to our national goal of making the na-
tion’s waters fishable and swimma~
ble.”

“President Reagan said he can’t. af-
ford this bill,” said Senator Quentin N.

'Burdick, Democrat of North Dakota.

“We in the Congress disagree with the
President. I believe the American peo-
ple disagree with the President. The
American people want clean water.”

Senator Robert T. Stafford, Republi-
can of Vermont, one of the key archi-
tects of the measure, said, “This is not
only a good bill, Mr. President, it is a
necessary bill.”

But Senator Stephen D. Symms, Re—
publican of Idaho, said that while he

supported cleaning up the nation’s
water, voting for the $20 billion meas-
ure was a “pollution of the budget pro-
cess,” and excessively expensive.

The bill was identical to one that
passed the House and Senate last Octo-
ber. That was vetoed by Mr. Reagan
after the 99th Congress adjourned in
October when he failed to sign it in the
required 10 days. This pocket veto
could not be overridden because Con-
gress was no longer in session.

Those who supported Mr. Reagan’s
veto today were Senators Dole, Symms
and Exon as well as Strom Thurmond
of South Carolina, Jake Garn of Utah,
Nancy L. Kassebaum of Kansas,
James A. McClure of Idaho, Jesse
Helms of North Carolina, Phil Gramm
of Texas, William L. Armstrong of
Colorado, Malcolm Wallop of Wyo-
ming, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Rich-

This week’s congressional override of
President Reagan’s veto of the Clean Water
Act was a major victory for environmental-
ists. While some say it will be difficult to
achieve similar victories on other environ—
mental measures, others claim the bill is only
the ﬁrst passenger on what promises to be a
powerful environmental bandwagon.

“The time for defense is over,” says Brent
Blackwelder, vice-president of the Environ-
mental Policy Institute. “We are going to
stake out our own programs and have a
much better chance of overcoming White
House opposition.”

Sources in the Environmental Protection
Agency say they do not think the override
promises a ﬂood of new legislation. Other
bills due for consideration this session, like
the Clean Air Act, are very contentious.

“Once they open it up, it will be a free-for—
all." says one ofﬁcial. In this view, other

.tmtsensus as the Clean Water Act and there-
fore will not be so easy to bring to a vote.

('lean Water Action Project, says he thinks

tum over the next 100 days on other

environmental legislation.” Frederic D.
Krupp, executive director of the Environ-
mental Defense Fund, agrees: “It is un~
likely the environmental community will
get the same kind of majority on other
measures. But there is a good chance they
will get greater support.”

“Reagan is an environmental lame
duck,” says Sierra Club spokeswoman
Adrienne Weisman. Other environmental-
ists call the vote an indication of a pro-
environmental Congress more willing to
stand up to the White House. Some of this
conﬁdence is based on the fact that the
Clean Water Act was one of only seven
overrides of some 60 Reagan vetoes.

Even some Republican members of
Congress agree that the overrride dealt
the administration was a major defeat.
Only 26 Republicans in the House and 1.4
members of the Senate (one Democrat)
supported the President.

Mr. Reagan vetoed the bill last week,

calling it just more “waste and pork”
from Capitol Hill. Supporters of the bill,
including the vast majority of Republican
members, refer to the act as landmark
environmental legislation desired by most
Americans.

But the Clean Water Act is popular in
Congress for two reasons, only one of
which is environmental. A vote for clean

water is very popttlar back home. Equally
important for many congressmen are the
new jobs and general economic stimulus
the legislation brings to every state.

The bill authorizes $9.6 billion in fed-
eral construction grants, paying for 55
percent of the costs of sewage treatment
facilities. In a move to attract Republican
supporters, the bill phases out the grants
program in 1991, replacing it with $8.4
billion in revolving loan funds run by the
states. Repayments from early loans will
ﬁnance subsequent projects.

The act also authorizes $2 billion to
clean up estuaries, lakes, and rivers and
to identify and clean up toxic pollutants
in water. States are given 18 months to
develop plans to control “non-point pollu-
tion,” such as petroleum resit me from city
streets and chemicals from gricultural
land which run off after a min. Water
pollution controls are tightened and new
pollution programs established. .

tar t for spending. A set 0 comml s
diligent from those that passed the
measure Will determine the dollars “at?-
propriated.” One close observer of these
appropriations committees is concerned
that not all the money will be prov1ded.
The administration will certainly request
less than the authorization level, and
some environmentalists think the chair-
men of the committees will want to put
more money into their favoite housmg
programs at the expense of environmen-

tal measures.

and the needs of the young or the aged.

Urey age responding by initiating a
nationwide campaign that, in effect,
lobbies against the anti-lobbying move.

“The l.R.S, proposals are based ei-
ther one misunderstanding by govern-
ment of the proper role of nonprofits or

are an attempt to muzzle the independ-,

Brian O’Connell, president of inde—

Eilanthropic coalition. The group is

service’s proposals and warning its
members about the threat it perceives.

1076 Law Was Welcomed

, At issue is a provision in a tax bill
passed 11 years ago, the Tax Reform
' Act of 1976, that puts a financial ceiling
on how much of their annual expend-

ceed the allowance. Nonprofit groups
welcomed the measure as clarifying

their right to inﬂuence policy through

The nonprofit groups say the revenue

sweeping fashion that the groups now

Opponents of the proposals argue
that a mention of pending legislation in
a research paper or discussion of such
legislation at a conference could be re-

The revenue service said the pro-
posals had been issued to interpret the
intention of Congress in financially
regulating the lobbying activities of
nonprofit groups under the 1976 law.
The service also said it had extended
from Feb. 5 to April 3 the period in
which comment is invited from the
nonprofit groups or the public.

The delay in issuing the proposals
stems in part from the sensitivity of
the issue and the need for consultations
with the Treasury Department, said-
Wilson Fadely, a public affairs officer
with the revenue service.

Few Hazardous Wastes

Controlled by EPA

GAO Report Charges M ismonagement

 

By Michael Weisskopf

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

A decade after Congress directed
the Environmental Protection
Agency to regulate the handling of
hazardous wastes, the agency has
imposed federal controls on less
than 10 percent of the 5,000 types
of- wastes regarded as potentially
dangerous.

This finding was contained in a
report released yesterday by the
General Accounting Office, which
criticized the EPA for mismanaging
a program devised by Congress to
ensure the safe storage, shipment
and disposal of industrial wastes.
Without proper handling, the haz-
ardous materials, many of which are
carcinogenic or mutagenic, can pol-
lute the air or seep into the ground
and poison water supplies.

The EPA, according to the re-
port, “cannot say what portion of
the universe of hazardous wastes it
has identified and brought under

regulation, or even if it is regulating
the worst wastes in terms of poteno
tial impact on human health and the
environment. Its waste identifica-
tion activity has been hampered by
low or changing priorities and
changing approaches or strategies.”

Rep. James J. Florio (D-N.J.),
who released the study, said it “sug-
gests that untold amounts of toxic
wastes may be contributing to the
nation’s growing problems with
ground-water contamination and
long-term environmental damage
primarily because the EPA has
failed to do what Congress has re-
quired.”

Jeffery Denit, deputy director of
EPA’s Office .of Solid Waste, said
the program has been stymied by
limited resources and low priority.
He added, however, that efforts are
being made “to turn the corner.”

Since the program was estab-
lished in late 1976 by the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act,
the EPA has imposed regulations on

'450 types of hazardous wastes re-

sulting from specific industrial proc-
esses. For example, the waste-wa-
ter sludges from the production of
most dyes must be treated before
land disposal. -

The regulations also extend to 14
heavy metals contained in the
wastes of manufacturing processes,
including mercury, lead, cadmium,
arsenic and chromium. ,

Those wastes were placed on a
regulatory list in 1980, subjecting
industries to penalty if the sub-
stances were mishandled. In the
past six years, however, the agency
has added only five. types of waste
to the list, the GAO reported.

At the same time, the EPA iden—
tified 5,000 potentially dangerous
wastes that are candidates for reg~
ulation. They emerged from a re-
view of four industries: organir
chemicals, inorganic chemicals, pe-
troleum refining and wood preserv-
ing. After finishing listing wastes
from these industries in 1990, the
EPA plans to fecus on another five
categories of manufacturers.

'In targeting wastes for regula-
tion, the EPA gave exemptions too
liberally, according to the report.
When Congress directed the agency
in 1984 to reconsider 150 excep-
tions, the EPA upheld only 32.

“It’s shocking to learn that the
EPA has moved to expand rather

. than close these types of regulatory

loopholes,” Florio said.

Fumigation of bat caves

Annual fumigation of bat caves in Israel
has been taking place since 1958 in an
attempt to eradicate the Egyptian fruit
bat Rousettus aegyptiacus. Research
has shown that this bat is not a problem
since it eats only fruit that is too ripe for
commercial use. Fumigation with lin—
dane still goes on, however, even in
caves within national nature reserves,
destroying insectivorous bats (which are
protected under the lsrael Wild Animal
Protection Law), owls and cave invert~
ebrates. Lindane decomposes only
slowly in caves, and the toxic effects
may last for decades, endangering wild-
life and presenting a major health
hazard for tourists. The Nature Reserves
Authority has concluded an agreement
with the Ministry of Agriculture to dis-
continue unauthorized fumigation of
caves in nature reserves, but conserva-
tionists want all cave fumigation
stopped and compensation to be paid to
farmers for veriﬁable fruit-bat damage.

Sarawak’s crocodiles need help

Sarawak's two species of crocodile have
been so heavily exploited for hide that
they could be on the brink of extinction,
according to a recent survey. Present
stocks of saltwater crocodile Crocodylus
porosus appear to be less than one per
cent of pristine populations, and the
false gharial Tomistoma schlegelii was
confirmed in only one river system. Jack
Cox of WWF Malaysia, and Francis
Gombek of the State's Forest Depart-
ment, recommend: a ﬁve—year ban on
harvesting and trade of saltwater croco-
diles from the wild; investigation of
reports of smuggling of live crocodiles to
Singapore; establishing Sarawak man-
groves as an lntemational Biosphere
Reserve; creating Wildlife Sanctuaries;
and captive breeding to replenish wild
stocks.

Averting a dearth of funds for Earth

 

By Rafe Pomerance

 

HE United States’ ﬁnancial sup-

port of the United Nations Envi-

ronment Program is shriveling -
just as that agency is nearing signiﬁcant
international successes.

During the past three years in which
the US has cut its contributions to the
agency in half, UNEP has been a catalyst
for action on global problems that
threaten the life support systems on
Earth.

Scientists say that some ozone deple-
tion may have already occurred and that
global warming from the greenhouse ef-
fect may now be observable. This is not
the time for the US to withdraw support
from the UN’s environmental arm.

Once perceived to be the most environ-
mentally responsible nation in the world,
the US has a pitiful record of support for
UNEP in recent years. Since 1985 the US
contribution to UNEP has dropped from
$10 million to $6.8 million in 1987 - to
$4.8 million proposed for 1988.

Is this lack of ﬁnancial support linked
to a lack of accomplishment or action
within UNEP? Hardly.

UNEP’s role as an effective leader on
global issues was aptly demonstrated in
October 1985, when it cosponsored an
international scientific conference in
Villach, Austria, on climate change and
the greenhouse effect- the global warm-
ing expected from pollution of the earth’s
atmosphere.

Characteristically, that conference
was a cooperative UNEP eﬁ’ort with two
other international agencies concerned
with the earth’s natural systems, the

(continued)

whether it was their intention or not, of in-
creasing the potential market for excess
Canadian electricity in the US.”

“I hope,” Mr. Hodel concluded, “that
the US. isn’t so naive and foolish that we
fall for that kind of doublespeak.” While
serving as energy secretary, Mr. Hodel op-
posed Canadian electricity imports into the
Northeastern U.S., but the sales eventually
were approved.

Jim Wright, head of the environment
section at the Canadian Embassy here, dis-
missed Secretary Hodel’s comments as
part of a “conspiracy theory.” While call-
ing the theory “ridiculous,” he said “it is
of concern to us when we hear it from se-

. nior representatives of the US. govern-
._~ ment.”

Meanwhile, Canadians are complaining
that the US. has failed to keep its commit-
ments to fund clean coal—burning demon-
stration plants.

A report prepared by special envoys
Drew Lewis of the US. and William Davis
of Canada called for the US. to spend $1
billion a year for five years on certain
kinds of demonstration projects. with half
of the money to come from the federal

World Meteorological Organization and
the International Council of Scientiﬁc
Unions. Uncharacteristically, the confer-
ence resulted in a statement of rare scien-
tiﬁc consensus.

Some 80 scientists from 29 countries
concluded that “as a result of the mcreas-
ing concentrations of greenhouse gasses,
it is now believed that in the ﬁrst half of
the next century, a rise of global mean
temperature could occur which is greater
than any in man’s history.”

Conference participants also departed
from traditional reluctance to consider
policymaking, observing that “the rate
and degree of future warming could be
profoundly affected by governmental
policies on energy conservation, use of
fossil fuels, and the emission of some
greenhouse gases.”

The consensus at Villach clearly de-
manded further global action. Working
with the US Environmental Protection
Agency, UNEP cosponsored last June
1986 a week-long conference on depletion
of the earth’s protective ozone layer and
climate change, highlighting the risks of
such changes to human health and the
environment.

Sixty of the world’s top atmospheric
scientists and policymakers from nine
countries weighed the potential effects of
increased ultraviolet radiation from
ozone depletion on plants, aquatics, and
human health, as well as the effects of a
global warming on sea level, water re-
sources, and agriculture.

But the most critical of UNEP’s current
goals is to achieve a protocol to put in
effect the Vienna Convention for the Pro-
tection of. the Ozone Layer.

The convention, which was put to-

government. The Reagan administration
claims the US. will spend that amount.

But the HS. counts research unrelated
to the clean-coal projects. For the clean-
coal projects, which are aimed at reducing
acid rain, the federal government plans to
spend a total of only $750 million. Canada
contends that only $1.7 billion has been
slated by the US. government and private
sector combined for projects that meet the
criteria in the report.

Tiger Killed by Police
on Georgia Interstate

VALDOSTA, Ga. (lPl—A Bengal
tiger was shot and killed on Inter-
state 75 as it charged law enforce—
ment officers who had hoped to
tranquilize it, authorities said. The
animal, weighing between 250 and
400 pounds, was shot Sunday night
about two hours after it was first
spotted.

Authorities said they did not
know where the tiger came from
but speculated that it either es—

gether by UNEP in 1981 and ﬁnally
signed in 1985, establishes for the ﬁrst
time the framework for a worldwide co-
operative pollution control agreement,
and one that attempts to anticipate an
environmental problem.

But depletion of the ozone layer will
not be averted unless concerned parties
meet and reach agreement on a protocol —
what to do exactly, and how to do it.
Organized by UNEP, these negotiations
represent important continuing progress
in reaching a genuine solution for the
ozone layer.

Last month in Geneva, 120 representa-
tives from 25 countries agreed that new
measures must be taken soon to control
emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals.
Despite the European Community’s and
Japan’s reluctance to consider long-term
control measures, UNEP is forcing the
pace: It has scheduled the second round of
negotiations in Vienna for next month.

The issues raised by ozone depletion
and the greenhouse eﬁect transcend con-
tinental borders. They cannot be solved
unilaterally. They demand a forum in
which the nations of the world face each
other as fellow inhabitants of the planet,
to agree on solutions for problems that
threaten us all.

UNEP has proved its ability to stimu-
late leadership on key global resources
issues. The US has an obligation to itself
and the rest of the world to give UNEP
the ﬁnancial support it needs to continue
that work.

Noise From Military Jets inWest Is Drawing Fire

By THOMAS J. KNUDSON
Special to The New York Times

DENVER, Jan. 10 — Military jet
ighters and bombers on training mis-
:ions are increasingly shattering the
erenity of the American West, sowing
inger and bitterness among rural resi-
lents who in the past had little quarrel
with military activities.

“You don’t know what a war zone it
5 out here,” said Ed Robbins, 53 years
nld, a former rancher who lives in
vest-central Nevada near the Fallon
laval, Air Station, where pilots are
rained. “When you look up and see

lavy attack planes coming in at tree .

evel, well, it’s awesome. The ground
rembles. The noise is just overpower-
1g.”

Next week a Denver-based organiza-
ion, Western Solidarity, will sponsor a
national call-in” to urge Westerners
rho have been “buzzed, boomed or
ombed" to phone the military with
heir complaints. The issue has also

rawn the attention of Co ress and its
lvestigative arm, the neral Ac-
ounting Office.

In South Dakota, ranchers are so
pset with the low-altitude flights that
folks are ready to start shooting,”
aid a Nebraska rancher, Roy John-
reau, who lives a few miles south of
le border with South Dakota. The
lights, faster, louder and more exten-
lve than ever, have frightened wildlife
nd livestock, cracked ranch homes’
rindows and walls, disturbed Indian
eremonies, angered civilian pilots and
riven people from homes. In recent
ears seven planes crashed.

As the Defense Department budget
as grown, the military has increased
s pilot training and acquired more

ind for flights. ”Technological ad-g

ances have made low-altitude naviga-
onal training, simulated bombing
lissions and supersonic maneuvers
lore common.

“The enemy has gotten more sophis-

cated,” said Comdr. Dick Toft, com-.

landing officer at Fallon, a supersonic
raining ground. “It does little good to
rain at 350 knots if even third-world
entities are ﬂying at the speed of
m .0! ' .

Louisa Bailey, deputy chief of public
ffairs at Luke Air Force Base, Ari-
ana, said, “Combat experience has

emonstrated that the effectiveness ‘

nd survival of air crews are greatly
ffected by previous training.”

 

 

Doctor Cites ‘Tremendous’ Stress
“People are under a tremendous
iamount of stress,” said Dr. Richard
Bargen, who practices medicine in
Gabbs, Nev., near the Navy base.
The General Accounting Office is
preparing a report on the use of air-
space for military purposes at the re-
quest of Senator Jesse Helms, Republi-
can of North Carolina. “This is an issue
.of growing concern nationwide, in
'particular because of the advent of
.more sophisticated aircraft and the
military’s need to maintain pilot profi-
ciency," said Thomas Barchi, a CAD.
official. . " 7
Last year, Representative Harry
Reid, a Nevada Democ at who has
been elected to the Senate, sponsored a
bill to make the military seek ( Tongresr
sional approval for allocations of air—
space and prepare statements on the
impact they will have on the environ-1
ment. The bill failed, but a similar one
is expected this year. “We wanted to do
something about the way airspace is al—

 

located,” said Melanie Berger, Mr. ,

Reid’s legislative assistant. “Right
now the military simply goes through
the Federal Aviation Administration.
which is pretty much a rubber stamp.”

An F.A.A. spokesman, Fred Farrar,
said: ”That may have been accurate in
the past, but I don’t think it is now. We
have for several years been working
closely with the military to encourage
them in every way possible to make

 

‘Flying too low
-— just for fun,’

 

 

 

Gov. Richard H. Bryan of Nevada
said the military uses 40 percent of his
state's airspace. “My fear is that one
dav, if we don’t raise this issue now, my

successor will awaken and, lo and be:

hold, the military will have 75 percent
of our airspace," he said.

“We are not trying to run the mili-
tary out of Nevada,” he said, “but
there needs to be more coordination at
the Pentagon level. Right now, the Ore-
gon National Guard has requested air-
space in Nevada. The Strategic Air
Command has requested some corri-

'dors. We are. being piecemealed to

death. They can’t have it all.”

In Dixie Valley, Nev., sonic booms
have made residents leave their
homes; they receive compensation
from the Navy. In Wyoming, South
Dakota and Nebraska, low-level B-52
flights have kept ranch families awake
all night, frightened schoolchildren, in-
terfered with small planes that check
cattle herds, and caused stampedes.

Last; year ranchers lofted a cluster of
balloons to protest the seizing of what
they consider their airspace. “We’re
just plain tired of it,” said Mr. John-
dreau‘. “The planes scare everything,
including the people,” He lives south of
Gordon, Neb., near a Strategic Air
Command flight lane. “They claim
they never fly below 400 feet, but that’s
not what happens - they are hardly
ever that high,” he said. “These pilots
are just young kids. They are like high
school kids out joy riding in a convert-
1irble. They are flying too low —— just for
un."

Poles Protest Pollution

I WARSAW—About 30 members of the small Peace
and Freedom movement were arrested after demon-
strating in the southwestern city of Wroclaw against
an and water pollution from a nearby steel mill.

A spokesman for the movement, formed in the
early 1980s to campaign against military conscrip-
tion, said the demonstrators had intended to lead a
march to the foundry but were dragged away by
police. Thirteen demonstrators appeared in court
later in the day and received fines.

Environmentalists say the Siechnice foundry.
which produces term-chromium composites, is
emitting toxic metal dust near a reservoir that is
the main source of Wroclaw's drinking water.

Glad tidings
of great joy

ne of the most common
complaints made by
readers of environmental

journals and magazines. this one
included. is that the news is
always so unremittingly gloomy.
Why, they ask-for the sake of
-morale, if, nothing else—can't
there be some relief. some small
measure of cheer?

Well, the first answer is that
there is, a little —it'sjust that you
don’t always catch it as it goes by.
And the second is that, out in
real life. environmental good
news exists in proportion to
environmental bad news at about
the same ratio as an elephant's
.hair to an elephant's skin.

To sacrifice coverage of large.
urgent problems—say, rain-
forest destruction or whaling——
for a lot of soothing reports
about schoolkids and frog ponds
might promote the public peace
of mind. but it would also give
the wrong impression of reality.
would describe something like a
woolly mammoth when the
object in view is an ordinary
pachyderm. And the third ans-
wer is that. whatever else the job
of an honest news medium may
be, it is never to lull.

On the other hand, it is nearly

Christmas, and not only might
this be regarded as a good time to
ease up on the beleaguered
reader, but the world at large
appears, in any case. to have con-
spired to produce an unusually
concentrated collection of happy
turns of events. This does not
mean that the aforesaid world
has ceased to head for hell in a
handbasket. just that this is one
of those times when it seems, at
least. to have slowed down for a
curve. So here goes. and Happy
Christmas.
0 The government of Canada—
a country that, perhaps in re-
action to the embarrassing inter-
national protests over the New-
foundland seal hunts, was begin—
ning to earn a reputation as a
world—class conservation vil-
lain—has appointed an environ—
ment minister who, after a slow
start, has been behaving as
though he would like to reverse
that trend (reports Robin
Bovey).

In September, the minister,
Tom McMillan. who had been in
office for about nine .months
without doing much more than
making the usual political prom-
ises, suddenly flew to Canada’s

 

huge, far-north Ellesmerelsland
and declared the whole place a
national park. Then he got back
on the plane. ﬂew west to
Bathurst Island and announced
the establishment there—in a
unique lowland valley with its
own warm microclimate and a
large nesting population of the
same Brant geese that winter in
Britain—of the Polar Bear Pass
National Wildlife Area.

That done. in the next week he
proceeded to stun a meeting of
the Canadian Parks and Wilder-
ness Society by publicly resus-
citating a policy that even the
most optimistic conservationists
had long given up for dead—
marine parks. Eventually, he
said, there were to be 27 of them,
and initially there would be four,
including, mirabile dicta, South
Moresby Island in British Col-
umbia's Queen Charlotte group
(see BBC WILDLIFE. June 1986).
C When. less than 10 years ago,
it was discovered that every
winter virtually every monarch
butterfly native to central and
eastern North America could be
found hibernating in flocks of
millions in one or another of only
11 small oyamel fir groves in the
mountains near Mexico City, it
was also discovered that almost
all of these groves were in danger
of being converted to firewood
by local farmers.

But this year, thanks to pres-
sure from a local conservation
group, Monarca AC, and the
World Wildlife Fund, the gov-
ernment of Mexico—a country
with about as many problems as a
country can have—has taken the
trouble to buy up the sites and
turn them into sanctuaries.

(Had it not detracted from the
good-news theme, it might have
been worth mentioning here that
the eastern butterﬂies have had a
lot better luck than the western
ones, which migrate to expensive
real estate in southern Califor—
nia. Of 45 known sites, seven
have been destroyed in the past
two years, in some cases after
developers have promised sol-
emnly to leave them alone.)

0 Burundi has banned the
export of ivory. This small, over-
populated Central African coun-
try, which for many years was
known to have only one resident
elephant—and that lived in a zoo
until 1985, when it died of
natural causes—has in the past
decade exported the tusks of
more than 200,000 animals;all of
them killed illegally in neigh-
bouring countries, mainly
Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zaire
and Uganda, so that their ivory

 

could be exported to, usually,
Dubai or Singapore (and see
page 620 for further joyful tid-
ings). '

An ofﬁcial of the Convention

on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES).
which almost since its inception
has wanted to plug this drain. has
given particular credit for
Burundi's decision to Audace
Kabayanda, the head of parks
and wildlife.
O A breeding population of
Sumatran rhinos has been disco-
vered in a remote valley in the
Malaysian state of Sarawak, on
Borneo, where such a creature
had not been seen in 40 years. A
survey team funded by the Ear-
thlife Foundation and led by Dr
Julian Caldecott discovered and
definitely identified five of the
rhinos—whose species, Dicero-
rhinus sumatrensis, is listed by
the International Union for Con-
servation of Nature and Natural
Resources (IUCN) as one of the
world's dozen most endangered
animals.

More precise identification of
the spot awaits government
guarantees that the rhinos can be
protected from poachers, and to
this end Dr Caldecott and
Sarawak’s forest department
have enlisted the indigenous
people in the animals’ neigh-
bourhood to act as guards, a role
they have accepted, apparently,
with enthusiasm.

According to Earthlife, the
forest department has also

devised a way of controlling
hunting by the employees of
nearby logging camps. and the
timber industry is said to be
spending its own money to make
sure that these controls work. Of
course, just what the logging
camps are doing there and why
their employees are allowed to
hunt at all will have to wait for an
ordinary bad-news column.
0 It is no longer legal in the
Philippines to dynamite ﬁsh—or
to poison them or to drive them
into nets by using stones or sticks
to pound (and in the process
destroy) the coral reefs in which
they reside. The prohibition is by
decree of President Corazon
Aquino, who has probably done
more for conservation in 1986
than anyone else in the world.
0 After five years of existence.
the panda breeding centre in
China’s Wolong Nature Reserve
has a panda cub to show for its
efforts. The father is seven-year—
old Quan-Quan—who at one
point in his career was on display
at Toronto Zoo—and the mother
is Li-Li, a native of Wolong.

Artificial insemination was
followed by natural mating. and
because certain oestrogen
monitors were not set up at the
time, it is not clear which method
produced the result. The latter.
however, is gaining favour with
scientists as the most effective
way of making pandas—and this
is good news, most of all, for con-
servation’s own mascots.

ECOFUND
LAUNCHES NEW
BOOK ON
THREATENED
SPECIES

Ecofund has just released a new book entitled, ‘A
Threatened Species Conservation Strategy for
Australia’. The book, edited by Ecofund’s
Michael Kennedy and Ross Burton forms part of
our national campaign on conserving the growing
list of threatened species, and particularly to see
the introduction of endangered species habitat
protection in every state and territory of Australia.

The book lists nearly 3000 individual species
of plants and animals to which some degree of
conservation concern can be linked. Enormous ef-
forts, far beyond those currently employed, will
need to be made if these number are to be reduced.

The book is foreworded by Professor Harry
Messel, Sydney University and Dr Fred Bell,
University of New South Wales. Their respective
comments highlight the importance of this book.

“The stated objectives are basic and sound and
are to be applauded, but the road to attaining them
will be particularly rough and will require the en-
thusiastic support of those members of our society
who believe in the genetic imperative."

“This book is stimulating and thought-
provoking . . . It presents a clear and practical
scheme that should play an important role in the
preservation of threatened species of Australian
animals. I am sure it will impress most others as
much as it has impressed me.”

By KEN WELLS
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Tired of yellowed philodendron? Hate
plastic potted palms?

Now you can have real plants with all
the carefree benefits of plastic ones. So
says Weyerhaeuser Co., the Tacoma,
Wash-based forest products giant, which
wants to revolutionize the house and o na-
mental-plant market with a patented
chemical process that essentially embalms
real plants and preserves them indefinitely
in a lifelike state.

The company, through its Auburn,
Wash-based Weyerhaeuser Specialty
Plants Division, will soon begin shipments
of tiny evergreen bonsai trees in a first
test of what it hopes will become a lucra-
tive preserved-plant market. The trees,
says Stephen Barger, the division’s general
manager, require no watering, pruning or
repotting.

“But holy-moly, these things look real,"
adds Mr. Barger, who says the only re-
quired maintenance of preserved plants is
“an occasional light cleaning.”

Preserved trees aren’t going to be
cheap. Mr. Barger said consumers can ex-
pect to pay about $250 to $300 for an aver-
age eight-foot specimen, which is about
two to four times the cost of a live tree, but
“in line” with prices for quality artificial
trees of similar size.

Mr. Barger also said the company
doesn’t yet have a good fix on the size of
the preserved plant market, though it
thinks it is huge. Weyerhaueser itself, for
instance. has about $280 million in sales
of nursery products annually but repre-
sents only a small part of the nursery in-
dustry, which is dominated by thousands of
independent growers. The company also
plans to vigorously market its preserved
plants against artificial plants, which
lately have been creeping up in market

CITES CHANGES
STIR CONCERN

Two recent actions by the secre-
tariat of CITES, the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, are
troubling conservationists. In an at-
tempt to control trade in elephant
tusks, a quota system was instituted.
But no provision was made for ex-
cluding stockpiles of illegally taken
ivory from trade. Instead, since De-

eucalyptus and beech, which have been
difficult to maintain indoors.

The process also allows the use of dyes
to both enhance a plant's natural colors or
to even turn green trees into red ones.
The result, said Mr. Barger, could be the
heretofore impossible creation of “dra-
matic interior ‘plantscapes’ ” in hotel lob-
bies, office buildings, hospitals, restau-
rants and shopping malls.

Though it continues to perfect the pro—
cess, invented in Sweden in the late 19705,
Weyerhaeuser said it has satisfied itself
with marketing studies that its embalmed
plants can’t be distinguished from live
ones. Company scientists also visited Swe-
den, where they saw test plants preserved
eight years ago that continue to “look and
feel fresh," the company added.

Preserved plants, according to Mr.
Barger, also will be an answer for those
without green thumbs.

“They (preserved plants) will be a boon
for people who love plants but who, for
whatever reason, can’t seem to keep them

Washington, DC. 20064

The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship and The Center for Advanced Training in Cell and Molecular Biology are
pleased to announce the availability of two Albert Schweitzer Summer Fellowships for 1987. The Albert
Schweitzer Summer Fellowships are intended to provide well-motivated students in biology or medicine with
an opportunity to obtain specialized training in cell and tissue culture and related cell and molecular biology
disciplines.

Recipients of the awards will spend 9-10 weeks, including June and July, at The Center for Advanced Training
in Cell and Molecular Biology where they will attend at least two 5-day training courses, Basic Cell and Tissue
Culture and In Vitro Toxicology, and become involved in a research program dealing with microwave effects
on cultured cells. Such training will facilitate the development of insights and laboratory skills which may
contribute to a reduction in the use of animals for experimentation and testing.

ELIGIBILITY: The Albert Schweitzer Summer Fellowships are open to currently enrolled first year graduate
students, college juniors or seniors, or first year medical students. Students must be majors in biology or
related disciplines such as biochemistry. The Center for Advanced Training in Cell and Molecular Biology and
the Catholic University of America does not discriminate on the basis of race, creed, color, national and
ethnic origin, age or sex.

APPLICATION AND SELECTION: The primary basis of selection by a committee will be academic merit
and an awareness of Dr. Albert Schweitzer's perspectives on the use of animals for biomedical research. Ap-
plicants must submit a completed application, a current academic transcript, a letter of recommendation from
an appropriate teacher, and 3 800-1000 word essay entitled: “A Personal View of Schweitzer's Philosophy of
Reverence for Animal Life.” Deadline for submission of application and all other documents is April 1, 1987.

FINANCIAL AWARDS/ TUITION REMISSION: The $1300 tutition and registration fees for the training
courses will be waived. The Albert Schweitzer Summer Fellows also will receive a stipend of $1250 to assist
them in defraying travel, housing, and other expenses. Low cost campus housing will be available. The Albert
Schweitzer Fellowship will provide the stipends for the recipient and an additional $750 for materials.

SPONSORS: The Albert Schweitzer Fellowship is a non-sectarian membership organization which seeks to
foster the ethic of Dr. Schweitzer of reverence for life, and to provide support for continuing his work at the
Albert Schweitzer Hospital at Lambaréne', Gabon. Its headquarters are at 866 United Nations Plaza, New
York, NY. 10017. The Center for Advanced Training is sponsored by the Department of Biology, Catholic
University of America, where doctoral research and instruction are part of a seventy-two year tradition. Fur-
ther information on sponsors may be found on overleaf.

Use of controversial pesticides in Africa sparks debate

US and UN agencies called to task for
failing to follow up on chemicals used

By Robert M. Press
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
. Washington

Three pesticides considered
unsafe by some United States
ofﬁcials are being used in Africa
and parts of the Middle East to
save crops from locust swarms.

The US Agency for Interna-
tional Development (AID) op-
poses use of the three pesticides.
But in one case one of them was
used in US-funded spraying last
year, and some AID oﬂ‘icials are
privately criticizing the agency’s
lack of follow-up in Africa.

The UN Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), which 1s co-
ordinating the pesticide carn-
paign, has not authorized use of
the three pesticides. But a top
FAO official defends use of one
of them as effective.

“Sometimes,” says Malunoud
Tamim, counselor at the
Sudanese Embassy in Washing-
ton, “countries are left without

any alternative” when contro-
versial pesticides are donated,
even ones which, he says, may
be “poison.” Sudan is using the
controversial pesticides.

During the next three to four
months, the locusts, if left un-
checked, could destroy vast por-
tions of crops in many nations.

“Is it better to starve to death
or have a little pesticide that
shouldn’t be there?” asks an of-
ﬁcial with the US Envirorunen-
tal Protection Agency (EPA).

But some experts say re-
search on alternatives has not
been pursued enough. “Some of
us feel very strongly we must
get off the chemical wagon,” an
AID oﬂlcial says.

According to AID oﬂlcials,
there are safer chemicals than
the three controversial ones:
lindane, benzene hexachloride
(BHC), and dieldrin. By its
nearly consistent opposition to
these pesticides in last year’s

reduce their use by other na-

tions. But documents made
available by AID show that, in

January 30,1987

last year’s spraying rush, the
agency waived environmental
and safety regulations on some
chemicals, including one waiver
for use of lindane in Niger.

An AID attorney says the
waiver was issued after the fact.
Although AID did not supply
lindane, it may have been used

inAlD-ﬁmded sprayinginNiger. ,

The attorney says more waivers
are likely this year but probably
not for lindane. Lindane is regis-
tered with the EPA for use

against grasshoppers. But its use

in spraying has been canceled,

anEPAoﬂlcialsays.

Thetwo other chemicalsare
both considered possibly car-
cinogenic. BHC is no longer reg-

has complained that apparently
there was no follow-up.

AID has strongly criticized
useofdieldrinintheFAO anti-e
locust campaign. But its use is
vigorously defended by Rasik
Skaf, a senior ofﬁcer at FAO’s
Locust Control Center. He says
there is no reason why FAQ .
should not transport dieldrin to
nations needing it.

“We still believe there, is nOt a
practical submtute yet for this
product in desert areas,” Mr.
Skaf said. It is widely sprayed,
in limited amounts, on vegeta-
tion in remote areas “not inhab-
ited by man or animals,” he
noted. He contended it causes no

AIDS to Dwarf Previous Epidemics, Official Says

WASHINGTON (El—A world-
wide AIDS epidemic will become. so
serious. it will dwarf such earlier
medical disasters as bubonic
plague, smallpox and typhoid, the
nation' a health chief said Thursday.

“You haven' t heard or read any-
thing yet, ” Health and Human
- Services Secretary Otis B. Bowen
told a National Press Club audi-.
ence. '

“If we can ’t make progress, we
face the dreadful prospect of a
worldwide death toll in the tens of
millions a decade,” he said.

Listing other diseases that have
killed millions of peep‘e over the
years, Bowen said acquired im-

mune deficiency syndrome “will
make these other ones pale by
comparison.”

He said he is confident that a
vaccine will be found but is equally
sure 1tw111not be 1n timetohead off
an epidemic of a scope that most
people have not yet grasped.

Carrying the Virus

Noting that there is no known
.- c, Bowen said 50 million'to 100

. million people worldwide could
have AIDS in the next two decades

and that at least 270,000 cases are
expected in the United States alone
in five years—with more than 10%
of the new cases by then being

 

among heterosexuals.

Between 1 million and 1.5 million
Americans are believed to be car-
rying the virus, and the estimates
of how many of them will go on to

develop AIDS have ranged from}

25% to 75%,01' higher.

“No one really knows how many-
since AIDS is spread by people free

of symptoms, and we don’t yet

have a comprehensive national

. program to provide blood tests that,

identify AIDS carriers, " Bowen
said.

AIDS is an affliction in which the.
body’s immune system becomes
unable to resist disease. ’

Saluinia molesta, known as Kan'ba
weed, found in the Moreni Wildlife
Reserve in June 1986, threatened the
Okavango Delta. The plant grows very
rapidly, forming a thick mat on the
water, depriving submerged aquatic

Zambesi oil—what prospects?

Concern is being expressed over the
exploration for oil and minerals in the
Zambesi Valley. Uranium has been dis—
covered, but may not be exploited for
some time as there is currently a world
over-supply. Oil has been discovered
east of the major wildlife areas. and
exploration seems almost certain to
spread westwards into wildlife areas
such as the Mana Pools National Park
Conservationists are not trying to halt
the exploration, but want to ensure that
environmental planning is an integral
part of the project, which is being
funded by West Germany.

Everyone’sﬁenealogical Mother

Biologists speculate that ”Eve "lived in sub-Saharan Aﬁ‘ica

backward. they would eventually con-
verge on a small group of ancients who
were ancestors of us all. Now biologists
suggest in a report to Nature that a sin-
gle female living between l40.00() and
280,000 years ago in Africa was an a nces-
tor of everyone on the earth today. In-
evitably ~~and to the probable delight of
creationistsw many scientists are calling
her "Eve."

The authors point out that the hypo-
thetical Eve, unlike the biblical one. was
in no sense the one ancestral mother of all
humans. There were other females repro—
ducing at the time who have modern de-

computer to analyze the differences be-

“family“ tree. Those differences were so
small that they could be explained by as
suming the existence of one ancestral
mtDNA. Then the biologists extrapolated

Swiss Accelerate ‘Evolution’
Of Bacteria to Fight Toxicity

Swiss biochemists have developed a method of
artificially directing the evolution of bacteria so as
to produce strains that can break down otherwise
toxic synthetic chemicals. They have already cre-
ated a strain of soil bacteria that cats and digests
one toxic substance, 4-ethylbenzoate, that no pre-
vious bacteria would touch.

The scientists say similar bacterial strains could
be developed to break down many different toxins
and released into the environment to multiply and
rid soil and water of dangerous pollutants.

The Swiss approach amounts to a laboratory
method of doing quickly what happens slowly in na-
ture. Most new synthetic chemicals that prove to be
environmental threats are organic compounds. As
such, they contain carbon and chemical energy that

could act as food sources for bacteria if the molecule
could be dismantled before its toxicity killed the
bacterium.

clusion the biologists reached by studying

Most of the DNA in human cells is in
the cell nucleus. in the form of chromo-
somes. Since chromosomes come from
both parents. this nuclear DNA is reshuf—
tied with each generation. confusing the
line of inheritance. But there is also DNA
outside the nucleus. in mitochondria. sub-
structures within each cell that are re-
sponsible for producing energy the cell
needs. Since the sperm‘s mitochondria do
not survive fertilization intact. mtDNA is
inherited solely through the mother. The
only way it can change over the genera-
tions is through mutation. And that muta—
, tion. evidence suggests. proceeds at a
steady. known rate. To calculate how
much time has elapsed since the muta—
tions that gave rise to today's variations
' began. the scientists need merely deter—
? mine how much change has taken place.

, To measure this change. the biolo-
' gists—Allan Wilson. currently on sabbat-

 

 

backward to calculate when that mtDNA
existed-—in other words. when Eve lived.

The facts that mtI)NA is maternally
inherited and that Eve‘s alone has sur-
vived mean that she was the only one
among her female contemporaries whose
descendants included some females in all
succeeding generations. Descendants of
the other females alive during Eve‘s time
eventually included generations that pro»-
duced no children or only males. thus
halting propagation oftheir mtDNA.

By considering the geographic origins
ofthe I47 people. the biologists were even
able to determine where Eve lived: sam-
ples from those of sub—Saharan African
descent showed the most intragroup dif-
ferences. implying that their mtDNA had
had more time to change and thus that
their ancestors arose earliest. This ﬁnding
plus the structure of the family tree indi-
cated sub—Saharan origin. a conclusion
that agrees with current archaeological
and anthropological theory.

The researchers concede some uncer-
tainties: about the mutation rate. for ex
ample. and whether it is constant. Still.
Stoneking says. the evidence shows that
"mtDNA is a good molecule for tracing re-
lationships between populations in gener—
al.“ And. adds Cann. “it is a way of weld-
ing molecular biology and anthropology.

 

do develop the ability to take in and break down
synthetic compounds. The. evolutionary event that
gives a bacterium this ability typically involves'a
genetic mutation that leaves the bacterium with one
or more genes for enzymes that break down, or di~
gest, the toxin. An enzyme is a molecular tool~~—
analogous to a smart wrench that can find and 100s
en a specific bolt---that dismantles a specific type of
molecule.

'l‘hese natural mutant strains enjoy a competitive
advantage over nonmutant bacteria because they
can make use of a previously unexploited food
source. But, the Swiss researchers said, the chem—
ical industry is producing so many new compounds
that natural evolution cannot keep up. As a result,
the substances accumulate in soil and water.

To produce a strain that could eat 4—ethylben-
Izoate (4BR), the biochemists first figured out a se~
quence of chemical steps that would break down the
tOIIlDiC‘X toxic molecule into progressively smaller,
simpler subunits that the bacteria could live on.

Then the scientists searched other bacterial spe-
ries for ones that already had a gene to ‘make an
rnzyme needed to carry out one of the steps. All
tells can make a variety of enzynu-‘rs used in break~
ing down organic molecules but not necessarily the
right combination to attack a novel molecule. The
scientists' goal was to find all the right genes and
combine them, through genetic engineering, in one
bacterial species, a common soil microbe called
Pseudomonas putida.

To find a suite of genes that worked in concert,
however, required a series of intermediate engi~
neering steps and exposure of the partially modified
bacteria to partially dismantled forms of 4EB. Like
natural selection, each experiment killed off bacter—
la that had not assimilated the new genes in the
right way and were thus not fit, in the evolutionary
sense, to carry out parts of the digestion of 4EB.

'lventually. the Swiss team produced a strain of
Pseudomonas that could feed entirely on 4158.

“The general strategy described here," the set-
entists wrote in last week’s Science, “will be appli-
cable to other pathways and to more complicated
evolutionary objectives, particularly to the devel-
opment of pathways for the catabolism [breakdown]

animated Animal Hovie:

Save the Earth!

Facing the terror of environmental destruction and nuclear
holocaust, many animals such as elephants, lions, and camels hold an
"international conference,“ and make a demand to selfish human beings:
"Don’t destroy the natural environment any more than you already
have!" a team has begun the filming of a full—length animated motion
picture in which the animals rise up to save the Earth. The name of
the movie is "SOS, This is the Earth." Last year was "International
Peace Year," and next month the UN Special Committee on the
Environment will meet in Tokyo, so the production staff is taking
advantage of this climate ”to appeal to not only children, but adults
as well, that it is important to preserve the Earth in its present
state and pass it on to the following generation."

The original idea for the film is derived from the children’s
book Animgl Conference by the German author Erich Koestner. This
author was subject to repression under the Nazi regime as a dissident
author, and so he expressed his fervent wish for peace by writing
Animgl Conference, based upon his own bitter experiences.

The movie begins when a nuclear missile of obscure origin
explodes over the sea near the north pole. Heads of state from all
the countries of the world hold a meeting, and make their usual
imposing gestures concerning the abolition of nuclear weapons.

But the animals are saying something, too. "If things continue
as they are, the Earth has had it!_ We are the only ones who can save
humanity, the animals, and the children. Let’s all get together for
an animal conference!" Word of this animal conference is passed on
from one animal to another, and representatives of all the animals in
the world gather in Paris, where they make their demands to the heads
of state: "Don’t destroy the environment any more. Don’t have any
more wars. Immediately get rid of your nuclear weapons. If you don’t
listen to us, we animals will never cooperate with you again." In the
nick of time, the human heads of state respond to the animals’
demands, and the Earth is saved.

The theme song runs through the entire film:

"The Sea is good just as it is,

Blue and expansive.

What else could one want?

Many lives shine brilliantly.

The Sea is good just as it is."

Among the more than 200 animals which appear in the film, there are
birds suffering from asthma due to atmospheric pollution, and monkeys
deformed by birth defects owing to the harmful chemicals used by human
beings to defoliate forests during warfare.

...The first version of the script was completed 10 years ago,
but since the production of a full—lenth animated motion picture
requires considerable labor and funds, the independent production team
was finally able to begin filming recently. The movie is scheduled to
be completed at the end of May.

Legendary cat shot

A female onza, a legendary Mexican cat,
said to resemble the puma Felis con-
color, was shot in January 1986 by a
Mexican rancher. The specimen was
preserved and dissected in Mexico by a
team of biologists. Preliminary findings
suggest that the Specimen is a new
species, but comparison of the limb
bones with those of female pumas and
electrophoresis of onza and puma tissue
are being carried out to conﬁrm this. it is
the ﬁrst specimen to be obtained since
the shooting of an onza in 1938 in the
La Silla Mountains—only a few miles
from where the 1986 specimen was
shot The 1938 specimen was lost after
claims that it was an onza were ridiculed

Federal Plan TEEatens National Rain Forest inﬁerto Rico

 

To the Editor:

The New York Botanical Garden in
the Bronx, an institution actively in-
volved in conservation u: the neotrop—
ics, recently expressed opposition to
the Forest Service’s p man-
agement plans for the Caribbean Na-
tional Forest (Luquill‘o Mountains) in
Puerto Rico.

The Luquillo Mountains represent
one of the few virgin forests left in the
Caribbean and probably the oldest re-
serve in the The area was
designated a forest reserve in 1876 by
theSpanlsh crown and asa man and
biosphere reserve by the United Na-
tions in 1976.

These mountains contain the only
example of the Tabonuco-forest type
that formerly occupied a vast area of
the island. They harbor 35 percent of
the native plant speciesof Puerto
Rico and include such
animal species as the Puerto Rican
parrot and boa. This forest system
also serves as headwaters for major
rivers that provide the water supply
to more than 200,000

heritage of Puerto Rico and provides
a magnificent recreatimial area for
Puerto Ricans and thousands of visi-

tors. Many scientific studies that
have greatly contributed to our un-
derstanding of tropical ecosystems
have been conducted in the area. In
addition, it has been a training grotmd
for many tropical biologists from
Puerto Rico-and abroad.

We consider the management plan!

a threat to the existence and integrity
of this forest. The commercial timber
harvesting, construction of new roads
and trails, and use for recreation of
an area of steep, fragile slopes that
are essential for watershed protec-
tibn will jeopardize the quality and
stability of the forest. These actions
will also increase the rate of erosion,
cause edge effects and reduce the
buffer zones. Erosion caused by tree
harvesting and road construction will
change soil conditions and accelerate
leaching of nutrients and soil loss.

It should be noted that isolated for- :

est reserves suffer changes on their
borders (the edge effect). Prominent
among these are environmental
changes such as increased tempera-
ture, light and exposure to wind, and
decreased relative humidity. These
are accompanied by biological
changes such as elevated tree mor-
tality, increased leaf fall and reduc-

tirm of bird populations. In the Carib-
bean National Forest, the commer-
cial exploitation of timber and ,tlw
construction of new roads and trails
will bring edge effects closer to the
core zone, the one that contains the
oldest forests in the reserve.

A very important aspect of forests,
asshowninrecentstudiesinthe
Amazon, is the size at the reserve.
The smaller the reserve, the , more
likely that the edge effects will affect
the core zone. In this way the outer
zones of the forest act as a buffer. The
Luquillo Reserve is not large enough
to be further reduced without precipi-
tating these devastating effects. '

It is vital that the United States take
aleadlng roleinthecmservationafnd
wise development of the tropical rain
forests of the world. How can we do
so if a rain forest under our own
Forest Service's jurisdiction is threat.

Antelope, 2"“unborn calves dieafter tractor attack

By MIéHAEL HAEDERLE
Post Reporter

 

'An antelope cow named Flash and two un-
born ante10pe calves died from stress at the
Houston Zoo after a man operating a stolen
tractor earlier this week ripped through their
enclosures and broke into the rhinoceros pen,
a zoo official said Thursday.

Tuesday, a day after the rampage, a female
beisa antelope named Claire aborted its fetus,
which was 2 to 3 weeks from term, said David
Ruhter, the 200’s curator of mammals.

Flash, a pregnant nyasa antelope cow who
was a week to 10 days from delivery, died
Wednesday after running a high temperature
for several days, Ruhter said.

And 3-week-01d Goblin, a scimitar horned
oryx, has been favoring one leg since he was
“kind of trampled” when the larger antelopes
stampeded in fright, Ruhter said. X-rays
showed no broken bones, however.

‘ “He couldn’t have picked a worse spot to go,
because all along that row we have very skit-
tish, nervous animals,” Ruhter said of the trac-
tor-driving suspect.

“These animals freak at the merest sugges-

tion of a problem,” he said. Beisas, nyasas and
oryxes are all species of African antelope,
ranging from 150 to 300 pounds as adults.

Jean Hus Baptiste, a 28-year-old native of
Haiti, has been charged with felony theft and
criminal mischief in connection with the Mon-
day morning mayhem, which caused an esti-
mated $15,000 in damage.

Baptiste, a former heavy equipment opera-I

. tor, is undergoing psychiatric evaluation to de-

termine whether he is competent to stand trial
and whether he was sane at the time of the
incident, assistant district attorney John Mun-
ier said.

Police said Baptiste somehow managed to
steal the expensive new tractor from a road
construction site in the 4300 block of Scott at
about 7:30 a.m. Monday. ‘

He allegedly drove the machine about two
miles to Hermann Park and crashed through
the 200’s locked east gate. .

As police and zoo employees followed cau-
tiously, Baptiste tore through the chain-link
fence lining the antelope pens and clipped a
canopy near the lion exhibit, Ruhter said.

“He drove past the bears, but it takes a lot
to get a bear excited,” Ruhter said.

Baptiste then wheeled the machine to the '

enclosure where the 200’s white rhinos —— Sam-
buru and Marsabit — reside, Ruhter said. Bap-
tiste ripped through the heavy railing around
the pen and began chasing the creatures,
Ruhter said.

Police were able to tackle him only after the
tractor got wedged on a rockpile in the rhino
pen.
Ruhter said the rhinos, who normally re-
spond to danger by running, are still edgy.

“It will just take them a while to figure out
what’s happening again,” he said, adding that
rhinos aren’t known for their intellect. “You

don’t have to be real smart when you’re built 1

like a tank."

Although most of the physical damage al-
ready has been repaired, the deaths of the
mother and unborn antelopes are considered a
“major setback” to the 200’s breeding pro-
gram, because other zoos are always anx10us

to buy them, Ruhter said.

“We don’t expect to lose any more animals, ‘

but we wouldn’t be surprised to see more abor-
tions or complications in the next week to 10

days,” he said.

An opportunity for our members to present
their views on controversial issues.

Killing 40,000 grey seals
won’t improve the fishing

 

his July, fishermen from Four-

chu, N.S., shot a few grey seals

as part of a carefully staged me-
dia event designed to convince the fed-
eral government and the people of Cana-
da that from 30,000 to 40,000 grey seals
must be killed to protect the fishing in
Atlantic Canada.

The ﬁshermen claim that grey seals
have voracious appetites and eat as much
as 40 kilograms (almost 90 pounds) of
ﬁsh each day. They also say that seals
(mainly grey seals) cause in excess of $1
million damage each year to ﬁshing gear
of f Nova Scotia, and that they transmit
a parasite, historically called codworm,
which ends up in the ﬂesh of cod and
other ﬁsh, increasing processing costs by
$4 million.

To assess the need for a culling pro-
gram, it is ﬁrst necessary to evaluate the
ﬁshermen’s claims and then to ask
whether a drastic reduction in grey seal
numbers will alleviate their concerns.

It is true that grey seals eat ﬁsh, some
of which are commercially important.
An average adult grey seal requires ap-
proximately i0,000 kilo-calories of ener-
gy each day, which translates into about
ﬁve kilograms of ﬁsh per day, or one-
eighth the amount claimed by some
ﬁshermen. (Therefore, any impact that
grey seals may have on ﬁsheries because
of their consumption of commercially
important ﬁsh is far less than implied by
the ﬁshermen’s claims.) Furthermore, it
is implicitly assumed that a grey seal cull
will result in larger catches, and thus a
greater economic return, for the ﬁsher-
men. These are naively optimistic as-
sumptions. Marine ecosystems and
ﬁshery economies are far more complex
than that.

Grey seals do damage fishing gear.
According to a recent study conducted

by the ﬁshermen themselves, damage to
fishing gear caused by grey seals of f
Nova Scotia amounted to $318.48 per
fisherman in 1983. Reimbursement
through a compensation program or in-
surance, and elimination of individual
seals observed around fishing gear,
might offer a better solution than a large
cull of seals. Culling programs are ex-
pensive, result in adverse publicity, and
may well miss the individual seals that
are responsible for the damage.

Of all the problems currently plaguing
East Coast ﬁsheries and identiﬁed by the
recent Kirby Task Force, codworm was
not even mentioned. Changing its name
to “sealworm”, and launching a major
cull of seals, will not eradicate this para-
site from commercially important ﬁsh.
There is no simple relationship between
the numbers of seals and the numbers of
worms in fish and no scientiﬁc evidence
that a cull of the seals will relieve the
problem. Quietly improving processing
techniques to reduce the incidence of
worms in fish in the marketplace would
seem more in the interests of the ﬁshing
industry than continuing to advertise,
through repeated calls for a seal cull, that
Canadian ﬁsh are infested with worms.

if the government decides to launch
a major offensive against East Coast
grey seals, particularly those breeding on
Sable island, it will give the appearance
of doing something and, in the short
term, placate ﬁshermen. Given our pres
ent scientiﬁc knowledge, however, there
is little reason to believe that such action
will do much to resolve the conflicts be-
tween grey seals and ﬁshermen.

Breeding time at the zoo

 

If the world wants animals, it has to take zoos more seriously, says Colin Tudge

United Nations’ Water Decade.

We are also well on the way—in
time if not in achievement—to the World
Health Organisation’s stated goal of “health
for all” by the year 2000. We’ve had inter-
national years for women, for fuel, for the
alleviation of famine, not necessarily in
that order, and although most of these
endeavours go down like lead

WE ARE NOW in the middle of the

subspeciﬁc differences within species.
Bomean orang-utans, for example, are
different from Sumatran. There are five
distinct races of black rhinoceros. Indeed,
the more you look at animals the more you
ﬁnd such intra-speciﬁc subtleties. So if you
really wanted to do a good, long—term, belt-
and-braces conservational job on a large
mammal you might ﬁnd you needed to

 

balloons they do give the
world’s conscience some kind
of a kick, and they do generally
leave a residue of organisa-
tion—an institute, perhaps, or
a campaign—to carry on the
work.

What we need now is an
International Year of the Zoo.
It’s time we stopped carping,
and pussyfooting, and con-
fusing issues of welfare with
those of conservation, and
took our responsibilities to our
fellow species seriously.

The basic issue has been
clearly stated by Michael
Soule, president of the Society
for Conservation Biology.
Within the next 100 years, he
says, at least 90 per cent of
species now on Earth will go
extinct. Admittedly, most of
those will be insects—or, to
be more precise, beetles—
deprived of their native tropi-
cal forest. Among the rest,
however, the large mammals
with which we might more
easily identify must all be
considered to be endangered.
Because they are large, they
require a lot of space; and
space is at a premium.

There would be no problem,
or very little, if the zoology of
Genesis were applicable; if
animals truely could be saved when led into
the Ark, two by two. The reality is that any
population of animals must contain scores
of individuals if it is to be safe from the
depredations of statistics: ﬂuctuations due
to chance mean that at any one time there
may be more males than females, and that
some of those females may be too young or
too old to breed, or may suffer some
obstetric accident.

If the longer-term dangers facing these
animals are to be avoided—the dangers of
inbreeding—then the “safe” number of
individuals rises to hundreds. Five hundred
is considered a reasonable “ball-par ”
ﬁgure. Furthermore, the breeding within
that 500 should ideally be arranged so that
there is maximal exchange and preserva-
tion of genes: in other words, all the males
should be given a crack of the whip, and not
just the keeper’s favourite stud. But this
maximal exchange of genes should ideally
be achieved without blurring the racial or

 

 

keep your eye on several thousand individ-
uals. That, in the case of many large
mammals, is already far more than exist in
the wild and in captivity combined.

There are several cases for keeping
animals in captivity as well as—or in some
cases instead of—in the wild. One is that if
conservation were done on the scale that
theory suggests is necessary, it would be
prodigiously expensive. People won’t pay
for what they don’t see; and the zoo, in
whatever form it takes, is a way of showing
people what they might lose.

A second reason, increasin y pertinent,
is that captivity is often sa er. Pollution
may have made life permanently impos-
sible for the wild Californian condor. When
animals are given their own havens, in
national parks, they may still be vulnerable
to poachers, wars, disease and drought, as
has constant] been the case in Africa.
Worse is the act that few wildlife reserves
have the status of national parks, and can

be encroached upon. Worst of all is the fact
that few of even the safest havens are really
big enough. The whole of Africa, for exam-
ple, apparently has room for only one
convincing population of wild dogs—1n
Botswana.

Animals can, however, be kept in worth-
while numbers in captivity. A few beasts—
those that are very big and very intelligent,
such as dolphins and perhaps
elephants—seem generally to
defy even the best attempts to
keep them satisfactorily. But
most can do well. I know a nice
pack of wild dogs that lives in a
series of enclosures just outside
Pretoria; and if I were a dog I’d
as soon live there as in
Botswana.

But we come back to the
problem of numbers. Some
zoos pride themselves, very
properly, on their breeding
records. But if we take
into account the long-term
theoretical dangers of in-
breeding—and the inevitable
loss of genetic variation in
small breeding populations—
then we can legitimately fear
that some of those zoos are
living in cloud-cuckoo land. In
a few generations’ time, the
increasingly in-bred progeny
are liable to prove infertile.
Some zoos specialise, and have
veritable herds of particular
species, such as the white
rhinos of Whipsnade. But
none can afford to keep the
hundreds of individuals of
each species that in theory are
desirable.

The way around this prob-
lem is for zoos to keep stud
books, and to exchange
animals for breeding: with
such cooperation, in theory, the world’s
network of zoos could between them
sustain the hundreds-strong breeding herds
that theory demands. But at present the
principle is established for only a minority
of species, such as Przewalski’s horse, goril-
las and the okapi. Disease regulations—as
well as the expense—preclude the free
passage of animals between countries; and
for most species, the technology that could
allow the genetic exchange to be achieved
by artiﬁcial insemination is not yet devel-
oped. -The overriding point, however, is
that there is no species for which the scale
of operations is sufﬁcient, or even, in most
cases, of the right order of magnitude.

In short, if the world wants animals,
apart from sheep and rats and cockroaches,
it should take more interest in zoos. Not
just a little more interest: it needs a whole
new conception of what they are, why they
are necessary, and the sheer scale of what is
required. El

THE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 1987

 

By WALLACE TURNER

Special to The New York Times

SEATTLE, Feb. 3 «— Fewer than a
timer. California sea lions here are gob-
blmg up a biologically treasured spe-
cies of the steelhead, a prize game fish,
and fish wardens seem powerless to
stop them.

The sea lions, who have been given
such nicknames as Hershel and Hump~
back, began their raids three years ago
in the waters below the Hiram Chitten-
den Locks where Lake Washington and
Lake Union waters‘ pass through navi-
gation locks to salt water at Shilshole

l 'lyhe steelhead tarry at the foot of a
fish ladder here before starting their
climb on the way to the freshwater
streams where they spawn, and it is
here that the sea lions get them.

Three times this month the wardens
of the Washington State Game Depart-
ment stretched their nets, and three
times they watched in frustration as
the 500-pound male sea lions swam

under or gracefully leaped over the .

nets. It was like trying to catch an
eagle in a butterfly net. . ‘

Support for the Sea Lions
Some people, including members of
Greenpeace, an environmental group,
cheered the escape. The demonstrators
were protesting the attempts to try and

capture the sea lions and take them to -

California.

Fishermen fulminated that it was un-
fair of the rapacious mammals to take
the steelhead when the trout were re-
turning to spawn. Indian and non-In-
dian fishermen, usually at odds over

.division of the fish runs, are in agree-
ment that the sea lions must go.

Some speak grimly of the need to re-
turn to the 1950’s when Washington
State paid a $5 bounty for a dead sea
lion. Now, along with whales, porpoises,
seals and sea otters, the sea lions are

alities of life in the wild as a sea lion
broke water to munch away at a 10-

-. pound fish that writhed against its

 

teeth. The sea lion itself is prey for the
orca, the killer whale.

“They don’t have to work very hard
for those fish at the ladder,” said Rob-
ert DeLong, director of a fisheries re-
search program at the National Ma-
rine Mammal Laboratory here.

Fast and Shifty

Steelhead, fast and shifty at sea and
popular catches for sports fishermen,
enter the sea lion diet only because
they are moving slowly before entering
the fish ladder. The usual diet of sea
lions, who at sea dive up to 650 feet, is
such sluggish swimmers as Pacific
hake, walleyed pollock, squid and rock
fish.

Out of breeding season, Hershel’s
variety of sea lieu, of which there are
about 80,000, range as far north as the
shores of Vancouver Island, but the fe-
males remain in the breeding area be-
tween Baja California and the Channel
islands off Los Angeles. The males will
return there in May. There are 1,000

: No one knows how much the sea lions

captivity it takes up to 50 pounds of fish

With a dozen fishing at the locks, the
depredation to the steelhead run is sub-

.3 t is like a game of “catch me if
' ‘ you can” between humans and
sea lions at. the Ballard locks,
and many watchers can’t help root-
ing for the sea lions.

The federal and state game
officials have firecrackers, fast
boats, fancy nets and, supposedly,
more brain power. But the sea
mammals ignore the firecrackers,
dodge the boats, elude the nets and
continue to gobble salmon and
steelhead trying to reach their
spawning grounds.

The situation is so amusing, it
is today's chuckle on the national
televrsion news shows.

Officials, however, are not
laughing and, we’re sure, they don't
enjoy looking foolish. After all,
their job is serious. They have a

duty to try and save a valuable
and endangered natural resource,
the fish run in Lake Washington.
The greedy sea lions don’t nibble at
the salmon and steelhead, they
gulp them down at a rate that could
destroy 75 percent bf the run.
Moreover, the humans are
playing the game with a handicap
called the Marine Mammals Act.
it specifies that they must use non-
lethal methods to remove nui-
sance animals. They cannot shoot
the sea lions or poison them. ,
'l‘hey cannot shoot them with tran-
quilizers because the drugged
mammals very likely would drown.
After the sea lions. won the
last match, state ofﬁcials left to re-
think their strategy. When they
return to resume the game, we're
rooting for the humans. I

but the steelhead survived. Unlike
salmon, which come up river to spawn
and die, steelhead return to their river
of birth, spawn and go back to sea.

Robert Pfeifer, a fish biologist tor the
Washington Department of Game,
said, “The steelhead run at only 5,000
fish is peanuts compared to the salmon
runs, but the steelhead is a wild run and
that makes it special.”

Salmon Run is Later.

Each year, through the same fish
ladder, there are spawning runs of
about 50,000 Coho salmon, 15,000 Chi-
nook and up to 400,000 Sockeye salmon,
Mr. Pfeifer said. But these are fish
produced in hatcheries along the rivers
feeding into Lake Washington. Their
spawning runs through the locks and
fish ladder occur in summer and au-
tumn when the male sea lions are in the
South.

As for the sea lions and the steelhead,
Mr. Pfeifer said, “last year we had a
partial control program that started.
late With minimal funding, but we
saved about 1,800 steelhead when we
could have saved 2,700 if we had
started early with enough money.”

One of the most successful devices
last year was small explosive charges,
about firecracker size, tossed on the

"surface of the water. They caused the

sea lions. to move on.

“That hasn’t worked as well this
year because we have repeat offenders
who learned the noise won’t hurt
them,” he said. “Our taste aversion ex-
periments didn’t work, either.”

Biologists planted fish doped with
evil tasting chemicals that the animals
ignored.

The steelhead run will continue for
several more weeks, and the attemps
of the game wardens to remove the sea
lions are stalled until someone comes
up with a new idea, perhaps next year.

“They have become habituated,”
Mr. Peifer said. ,

Falklands
Mystery:
Dying
Penguins

ORT STANLEY, Falkland Is-

lands, Jan. 19 (Reuters) 7—

Something or someone is

killing the penguins in the
Falkland Islands and two British
scientists have been given the task of
solving the mystery.

Ian Keymer and David Horsley are
to visit the remote South Atlantic ar-
chipelago next month to try to find
the mysterious killer.-

The British-ruledFalkland Islands
,have one of the biggest penguin popu-
lations in the world and boasts four
species: the king, the Gentoo, the
rockhopper and the jackass.

, But last year some 3,000 birds died
in just a few months.

Tests on 15 dead penguins flown
back to the Government Veterinary
Investigation center in the eastern
English city of Norwich failed to pro-
vide the answer.

Now, in a bid to solve the mystery,
the two men will spend a month
among the penguins in their rookeries
,at the behest of the World Wildlife
Fund and the Falkland Islands Foun-
dation, a local preservation group.

Theory Cites Warships

Theories abound. Last year, a
Soviet scientific journal suggested
that nuclear material on British war-
ships sunk in the war with Argentina
in 1982 was to blame.

Dr. Keymer discounts this theory.
“If it were true, birds other than pen-
guins would 'be affected,” he said.

Many islanders think the waters
around the Falkland Islands have
:been drastically overfished by the
ghuge factory ships and attendant

:trawlers from countries such as Po».

Mediterranean monk seal. Unloved in the Aegean.

 

 

Monks and
fatalism

‘ ‘It is not the eleventh
hour for the Mediterra-
nean monk seal—it is

one minute to midnight.” This is

how Ian MacPhail of the Inter-
national Fund for Animal Wel-
fare summed up last September’s

Council of Europe (CoE) confer-

ence in Strasbourg on the world’s

most endangered seal species.
But even such an apocalyptic
warning seemed unlikely to gal-
vanise the assembled experts or
to dispel the frustration which
surrounds efforts to save the
monk seal. After all, this was the
third international conference on
the species since 1978. and dur-
ing these eight years, despite
ritual calls for more action and
fewer words. the monk seal
population has continued its
steady decline -— from 500 to 350.
By creating a Group of

Experts to draft recommenda-

tions for the protection of the

seal. the CoE was hoping to per-
suade governments to act under

 

 

the terms of the Berne Conven-
tion on the Conservation of
European Wildlife and Natural
Habitats. Unfortunately, there
was little evidence in Strasbourg
that the experts possessed either
the determination or the stamina
to win this race against time and
bloated bureaucracies.

Two years ago. the Mediterra-
nean monk seal was classified by
IUCN as one of the world’s 12
most endangered animals. The
seals‘ numbers may have been
reduced in the past 50 years by 90
per cent, and they face virtual
extinction by 1990.

Their original problem, in the
nineteenth century, was over-
hunting, but they are now dying
from the effects of pollution,
mass tourism and the animosity
of fishermen, who, faced with
exhausted fishing grounds, com-
plain that the animals steal their
fish and damage their nets. And
they usually don’t hesitate to kill
seals when the opportunity
arises. For example, in one inci-
dent in 1979, fishermen threw
dynamite into a seal cave on the
Greek island of Nera, killing
seven of the animals, among

them mothers and pups.

Today. scattered colonies,
often containing only a few indi-
viduals, are found in Sardinia,
Spain, Portugal, Morocco and
Tunisia. And though there is a
large and important colony in
Mauritania, the core population
is still found in the eastern Greek
islands and along the Turkish
Anatolian coast.

Here, border tension and
Greek fears for national security
may have signed the seal‘s death
warrant. as the military auth-
orities have continued to resist
recommendations for a network
of sanctuaries. Of the 19 reserves
which have been proposed since
1976, 17 have been rejected or -‘
shelved. One, in 1982 on the
island of Samos—despite orders
from the minister of environ-
ment—was invaded by develop-
ers. The remaining one. a marine
park in the northern Sporades,
has been in the planning stage for
more than eight years.

In other words, there are no
monk seal reserves in Greece.
And to make matters even
worse, some conservation organi-
sations have given up and pri-
vately declared the seal to be an
“unsavable species.“ Indeed, at
the Strasbourg conference—
which did not even include rep-
resentation from the Greek gov-
ernment—the eastern Aegean
was hardly mentioned, as if the
seal’s most important habitat had
mysteriously disappeared.

Predictably, the conference’s
final recommendations resem-
bled little more than a rehash of
previous ones, and perhaps the
main thing to distinguish it from
its predecessors was a disturbing
plan involving captive monk
seals in a dolphinarium in
France—a subject. after investi-
gation. for a future report.

depriving penguins of their natural

lateral fishing zone being introduced '

fish stocks will solve the problem.

But Dr. Keymer says that although
the dead penguins were emaciated
there is no firm evidence to support
the fish shortage theory. -

JAFHN’S hURlLE SEAL IN DéNGER
Unly Sic Remaining in Hokkaido

ihe only marine mammal species which breeds in Japan, the kurile
seal lJpn., zenigata azarashi, Phoca vituling stejnegeri], is
threatened with EKtiﬁCtan, and still has not gained legal protection.
{here remain a mere are seals on the rocky shore reefs of eastern
Hokkaido. in order to protect the only marine mammal which is native
to Japan. a group of young persons in eastern Hokkaido, which has been
conducting studies and observing the seals, has joined +orces with the
Nature Conservation Society of Japan {Tokyo} to inaugurate a
nationwide movement to protect the animals. This month the group of
young persons Hlll publisr an observation record for children entitled
“Uur Friend of the Sea, the hurile Seal.” Their first objective is to
have others g-i an understanding of the situation, and make a broad
appeal +or coexistence with all marine mammals.

ihe kurile seal is distributed in such places as the hurile
islands, the Aleutian lslands, and along the coast of Alaska; in Japan
it lives in 51% places along the rocky coast of eastern Hokkaido from
the Nemuro Peninsula to Cape Erimo. Four other species oi seals,
including the harbor seal, live among the Hokkaido ice floes, but the
hurile seal is the only one which makes its home here and breeds for
the entire year.

Last year the "‘ med number of seals was 376. ﬁccording to
specialists, this is absolute minimum needed to insure sufficient
continued breeding, and this makes the seal an endangered species. It
is said that before the war there were several thousand, but the
reckless taking of the seals h reduced their number drastically.

kazuo, a research . ' at the kyoto University Primate Research
Center, ‘ s with the purposes of research and
prot ction in l?73, . ' .‘ it year succeeded in getting the
Cultural Properties Fr. tommittee to nominate the Kurile seal
for designation as a Ha’u: ’ iommesorative Object. However, in
response to this there was complaint from local fishermen who said
that, “lhe seals eat the men caught in stationary nets. If you
grant them protection. L give us financial compensation.“ it was
for this reason that the matter of the nomination was shelved for over
lu years.

it was ii 198: that the “hurile Seal Research Group” was formed,
principally by students +rom nearby Dbihiro Eootechnical University.
in addition to surveying the habitat and numbers of the seals, the
group has perlormed a running study of damage to fishing, and has even
held a meeting to report these things to the local fishing
cooperative. .

lhe eliorts o? the young researchers to carry on a dialog with
those engaged in the fishing industry bore fruit last year when
+ishermen attended the group’s symposium. They have also held
repeated observation sessions, calling upon citizens to participate.

The Nature conservation SoCiety of Japan has moved to fully
support the ef+orts of the local group to protect the seals. The
first thing they did was to publish, in November of this year, an
anthology of papers entitled “lhe Ecology and Protection of the hurile
Seal.“ lhe observation record for children to appear soon will be the
next publication. lhe book uses many photographs, and presents a
daily observation log of seals raising their young, as well as the

results at studies on damages to fishing.

Conservation’s Best-Kept Secret

 

Protecting land the businesslike wa y—b y buying it

T o eager developers, Big Bend conjured
up visions of condos and tennis courts:
64,000 acres of wetlands stretching along
60 miles of the Gulf Coast of Florida.
Hardwood hammocks, saw grass, palms,
brackish scrub. Teeming with many exot-
ic—as well as threatened and endan-
gered—species such as alligators, mana-
tees, green turtles and bald . .
eagles. Probably the largest plot
of undeveloped private proper-
ty left in the East. .

Big Bend’s owner, Buckeye
Cellulose, a subsidiary of Procter
& Gamble, was asking a steep
price. But the c0veted land did
not end up in the hands of a
wealthy developer. It was bought
instead by an environmental
group, the Nature Conservancy,
which in December paid $20 mil-
lion for the property.

Operating quietly and un-
known to most Americans, the
conservancy has in the past
three decades bought hundreds
of similarly fragile environ-
ments. From its headquarters
in Arlington, Va., it now over-
sees a 2.61 million-acre empire
that includes more than 1,000
species of threatened plants and
animals. “We have been called
the best-kept secret in conser-
vation,” says William Blair,
TNC’s president emeritus. “We
are the largest private owner of
land sanctuaries in the world,
and we are either No. 1 or No. 2
in the amount of money we
spend on conservation each
year.” Says US. Fish and Wild-
life Service Director Frank
Dunkle: “The conservancy is
all action and no talk. While
others have been out preaching

 

worked with them and even lent them
money.”

That cooperation was recently dem-
onstrated near Palm Springs, Calif. Real
estate projects with a potential value of
$19 billion were being blocked by envi-
ronmentalists trying to protect the Coa-
chella Valley fringe-toed lizard, an en-

closest thing we have to a national inven-
tory of endangered ﬂora and fauna,” says
Blair. “It is much better than anything in
the Interior Department.” The conser-
vancy will also accept gifts of land, no
matter what their ecological importance.
But gift parcels with .no ecological value
are later resold, a policy that nets the or-
ganization about $14 million annually.
Most of TNC’s property is open to the pub-
lic for “passive recreation” like hiking
and bird watching, but that privilege is
sometimes abused. Says Morine: “If we
had our druthers, we would just as soon
no one came. The general pub-
lic is not very kind to nature
preserves. It’s usually beer
drinking bumper-to-bumper.”
The conservancy grew out
of two committees formed in
1917 by the Ecological Society
of America, but it was not until
1953 that it began demonstrat-
ing its buying power. In that
year TNC purchased and pre-
served 60 acres along the
Mianus River Gorge in New
York’s Westchester county.
Since then, it has been on an ac-
celerating spree. Between 1975
and 1985, for example, TNC’s
assets increased from $97 mil-
lion to $457 million and its
sanctuaries grew in number
from 533 to 900. In 1981 the
conservancy went internation-
al, and now has cooperative
programs in ten Central Ameri-
can and South American coun-
tries. Major benefactors have
included the Richard King
Mellon Foundation of Pitts-
burgh, which over the past de-
cade has contributed $65 mil-
lion, and 3M Heir Katharine
Ordway, who during her life—
time donated $1 1 .4 million. The
Goodhill Foundation, set up by
Ordway, has chipped in mil-
lions more.
f The conservancy’s ample
war chest gives it considerable

 

conservation, they have been
practicing it.”

Staﬂ'ers attribute TNC’s success to its
philosophy of nonconfrontation. While
the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Soci-
ety, for example, employ litigation, lobby—
ing and publicity as weapons, TNC prefers
to use gentle persuasion—and cash. “We
have very little to do with the activist en-
vironmental groups,” says David Morine,
TNC’s head of land acquisitions. “We
stay away from all that and get along
with everybody.” The organization has
even extended an olive branch to devel-
opers, a group that most environmental-
ists consider the enemy. “We are not in
conﬂict with developers,” says TNC’s
new president Frank Boren, himself a
former real estate executive. “We have

dangered species that inhabits the area.
After a series of studies concluded that the
reptile could survive if a 13,000—acre pre-
serve were established nearby, the US.
Fish and Wildlife Service asked TNC to
help raise the $25 million needed to pur-
chase the tract. Within four years, the or-
ganization had rounded up the entire
amount. The environmentalists were sat-
isﬁed, and the developers proceeded with
their plans.

All lands managed by the conservan-
cy support some kind of threatened spe-
cies or ecosystem. To keep track of other
critical land parcels that are potential
purchases, the organization maintains a
state-by-state computerized list. “It is the

 

clout. “We have a revolving
fund of $50 million that allows
us to be major players in the real estate
market,” says Blair. “We stand in line like
anybody else to buy property, but we can
act very quickly. We haVe often done a
million dollars’ worth of business on a
handshake overnight. We have got phone
calls at 2, and at 4 someone is on the
way to a land auction.” But mere millions
may not be enough. America’s burgeon-
ing population continues to infringe on
fragile environments, and land is becom-
ing more expensive. Says Boren: “We in-
tend to raise a billion dollars by 1995 to
save what is worth saving. It’s an achiev-
able goal.” —By Jamie wahy.

_ To Drill for

By Pinup 'Sminr-zcorr

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 -— Debate
over the interior _Department’s_ pro-
posal to openthe Arctic National Wild-
life Refuge to oil drilling opened here

differences between proponents‘ and
opponents of development.
At issue was an {interior Department
recommendation that all the refuge’s
1.5 million-acre coastal plain be avail-
able for oil exploration and extraction.
in testimony at an Interior Depart-
ment hearing, oil company executives
said ,the refuge represented the best
hope of a major new oilfield on land in
the United States. They insisted that
the country’s-national security and eco-
lowed to explore and deve the
coastal range of the refuge.
- Representatives of native Alaskan

ceeds‘ from the development of the
also asked that the oil potential .of the
wildlife refuge be fully developed
Concern for Caribou Herd

But spokesmen from environmental
groups urged that the department’s
recommendation be rejected, saying
the amount of oil that might be found
there was net worth the damage to the
fragile Arctic environment of the ref:
uge and its wildlife, including the great
migratory Porcupine caribou herd, the
largest of several herds in northern
Alaska. ‘ .

An. official of the government of
Canada’s Yukon Territory also op-
posed the development in the refuge,
as it would harm the people and
vi e of the territory and that the
United States was proceeding with
development without the legally re-
quired consultation with Canada.
initsreportontherefuge,the1n-
terior Department estimated that
there was 3.2 billion barrels of recover-
ableoil in the area. Assuming that oil
was found,'the department predicted it
would be selling for $33 a barrel when
ready for market a decade from now.
The world price of oil has recently been
[arotmd $18 .a barrel. The report said,
5howevef, that there was less than 1
f chance in 5 that there would be a signif-
:icant oil find.

Foes Clash 0n U.S. Plan

Oil in Arctic

In recommending that oil drilling be ‘

'. allowed in the coastal plain, the depart.
ment asserted that ways could be
found to minimize the effect that oil
development would have on wildlife.
However, Page 112 of the report, pre-
red by scientists of the department’s
Fish and Wildlife Service, included a.
warning that such development could
result in “a majorpopulation decline”

in the caribou herd, which is estimated '

to number 180,000. The report said the
“distribution” of the animals in the
herd could change from 20 to 40 per-
cent. Conservationists said this meant
that that much of the herd could be de-
stroyed, 'but oil company executives
said it would only. mean a change of
migratory patterns.

 

Congress to Decide issue

'Congress will ultimately decide on?
the fate of the refuge. Legislation was 9
introduced in the House this week to.
turn the entire refuge into a protected
wildernessarea, which would prohibit
economic development there.

James Posey, an official of Arco

' Alaska Inc., said the oil industry’s per-'

formance in developing the Prudhoe
Bay oilfield had “proven that ecologi-'
cal values are not sacrificed for impor-

tant national security and economic -

benefits.”

"Thirty years of development in
Alaska show that environmentally
sensitive operations can coexist with a .
highly productive Alaskan subarctic
and Arctic wildlife, including moose,
migratory caribou and migrating
birds,” ‘he said. ' l

Wayne Smith, district manager of-
the- Amoco Production Company,
warned, “if highly prospective areas
such as the-coastal plain are placed off
limits to petroleum exploration, the na-
tion may experience a future energy
crisis which will make the 1983 em-.
bargo and the 1979-1980 price escala-
tion seem mild by. comparison.”

On the other side of the issue, Rand-
all D. Snodgrass, Alaska program di-
rector of the Wilderness Society, called .
the department’s recommendation to
develop oil resources in the coastal
plain “totally unsubstantiated by the
findings in this report.” He said that
caribou were not the only wildlife that

 

would be adversely affected by oil ac-

Canada Urges U.S. to Keep
Alaska Tract Undeveloped

By a WALL STREET JOURNAL Staff Reporter
OTTAWA—Canada said it urged the
U.S. government not to allow oil and gas
development of Alaska’s northeast ‘
'. niake 1,120 tracts available for leasing
The 1.5 million-acre plain, part of the
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, was re-
cently recommended for oil and gas de-
velopment by the U.S. Interior Depart -
ment. Canadian officials met with a U.S.
delegation yesterday to discuss the pro-

The Canadian government said it op-
poses development of the plain, mainly
because animals such as caribou, snow
geese and polar bears that migrate be-
tween the Alaskan refuge and Canada
are important for the “subsistence life
style of native Canadians." U.S. envi-
ronmental groups have also urged that
the department’s recommendation be

, tracts
: tive or

 

 

tivities. Among the other species that
would be threatened, he said, are polar
and grizzly bears, muskoxen and mil-
lions of birds.

Amy Skilbred, an Alaska specialist
for Defenders of Wildlife, said the 'oil in
the plain would never provide. more

than 4 percent of the nation’s oil needs '

and that, contrary to the interior De
partment’s assertion, it could not make
more than a modest contribution to the
nation’s economy or security.

 

‘T‘l‘lie proposal was" ~immediately at-

tacked by members of California’s
Qatgressional delegation and environ-
mentalists who said the proposal did
littletoprotect the coastline, and bythe
oil industry, which said it did not. give
them enough of the shelf to explore. -

Previous proposals by the Reagah
Administration to lease California’s
outer continental shelf to oil and gas
companies have been largely blocked
b members of Congress, led by the
California delegation, who also fear
that offshore oil drilling may harm

local economies along the state’s coast. ~ .
' Last year Congress passed legisla-

tion barring any leasing in the disputed
areas off California until February
1989.” ' ‘

; Leasing to Start in 1989

a'l‘he proposal announced today wduld

in a five-year period starting in 1989.
interior Department officials esti-

' mated that two-thirds to three-fourths

of California’s offshore oil and gas re-
sources lie beneath the tracts to be
leased

:Mr. Hodel said that leasing had been
deferred for at least five years in
tha are environmentally sensi-
lﬁzare nwdedby the military
for ma ' ers. lie said the areas that
would be opened to exploration and.
development made up 13 percent of the
areas that had" been put off limits. by.
previous moratoriums imposed by
Congress.

,Among the areas where leasing

would be deferred are those off Cape

Mendocino and Punta Gorda, Cordell
Bank, San Francisco Bay, Monterey
Bay, Big Sur, Santa Monica and San
Diego, Point Reyes, Santa Barbara
Channel and the San Nicolas Basin.
Representative Leon E. Panetta,
Democrat of California, a leader of the
delegation’s effort to limit offshore oil .
activity, said, “this plan represents a
laration of war against the Califor-
n coastline.” ,
iMr. Panetta said the plan ignored the
"balanced approach” to offshore
development mandated by Congress.

' that the interior Department has esti-

lle-added, “Cmgrels and the Amer-
ican public-are net about to give this
Administratim a blank check off the
california coas ” - -

‘The American Petroleum institute, a
tnade organization, said in a statement
that while the interior Department}.
proposal was-“a good faith effort,” it
would ”frustrate the nation’s attempts
to meet is future energy demands." I

' The statement also said, “The 9'31
posal would defer large amounts
ve promising acreage from leasing
till 1991 at the earliest; would defer all
tracts in deep water, postponing early
evalution of some promising areas, and
ignores the fact that there is no evi-
dence that offshore oil and gas activi~
ties have any longterm adverseeffects,
on the environment.” ‘ . .
Lisa Speer, senior scientist for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an
environmental group, said: “We are
extremely disappointed in the depart-
ment’s proposal. Whatever hopes we
had entertained of a reasonable com-
promise are gone. it is back to the
trenche ’

s.
She added, “The need to offer the en-
. tire Califomia coast at this point is ex-
ceedingly dubious.” She noted that
President Reagan had recently vetoed
legislation requiring electrical appli-
‘ances to meet energy-efficiency stand-
ards that would have saved the equiva-
' lent of over 1.3 billion barrels 'of oil, al-
most as much as the 1.8 billion barrels

mated are, in the unieased areas off
California. '

Earlier Agreement Was Rejected

Two years ago Mr. Hodel reached a
“preliminary agreement” with the
California delegation. that would have
' limited theoffshore activity to only 150.
tracts of 9 square miles each off cali-
fornia, an area nearly 10 times less
than proposed today. Mr. Hodel later
‘ epudiated the agreement, saying. "it
was based on inaccurate information
labout wheretheoilandgas were in the
outer continental shelf area.

Today Mr. Hodel said that Califor-
'nia’s oil resources were needed.
“There is a continuing deterioration of
mar ability to produce-oil in the United
States,” he said: “Down the road we
l'simply won’t have wells to replace the
ones that are producing now.”

The interior Secretary said are news
conference that his p l reme-
:sented an “amalgama ’-’ of other
lproposals, including“ those of California
Congressmen, that stand safeguard
the environmental values of the coast-
‘line.

HUMANKIND IS probably now
the most numerous species of
mammal. With ﬁve billion of us, no
other primate comes close. North
American buffalo may once have num-
bered 60 million and white-tailed deer
40 million. There are probably 10 mil-
lion wildebeest in Africa. Even live-
stock fails to outnumber us. There are
1.3 billion cattle, 1.1 million sheep,
787 million pigs, and 64 million horses
in the world. And carnivores don’t be-
gin to equal us. Though cats and dogs
are probably the most numerous, there
is only one dog and one cat for every
ﬁve people in the United States. In
other countries the ratio of cats and
dogs to people is even smaller.

Among mammals, only rodents are
likely to rival humans for the teeming
title. It has been said that there is one
rat for every person on Earth. But
where studies have been made, the rat
population comes out smaller. Studies
by David Davis in the 19405 found one
rat for ﬁfteen people in Baltimore and
one for thirty-six in New York City.
Since there are 400 species in the Rat-
tus genus, and several species (brown

and Norway rats for example) are
lumped together in these counts, the
overall number of any species seems
unlikely to reach ﬁve billion.

There are other rodent candidates,
however. Ernest Thompson Seton esti-
mated that there were once ﬁve billion
prairie dogs, but today they number a
tiny fraction of that. One zoologist
believes lemmings, which occupy a vast
expanse of Arctic tundra, are more nu-
merous than humans. He has counted
them in densities of up to 1,000 per
acre and guesses it is safe to say that
brown or collared lemmings must
number in the trillions.

But there are dissenting voices here.
Tony Sinclair, a University of British
Columbia zoologist, says, “Trillions is
too big a number. I think people over-
estimate them. I would doubt that
lemmings are even in the billions.”
Sinclair believes that lemming popu-
lations are divided by mountain ranges
and rivers into noninterbreeding sub-
populations. 80, on that technicality,
man may be the most numerous spe-
cies of mammal.

Among birds, only the chicken

outnumbers us. With a world popu-
lation of at least 7.3 billion, chickens
appear to be the most numeroUs land
vertebrate. The passenger pigeon is
said to have numbered perhaps three
billion; if that controversial estimate is
accurate, it outnumbered humans
while it survived. The most numerous
wild species today is probably one of
the shearwaters or petrels that swarm in
huge ﬂocks over the southern seas.
john Warham of the University of Can-
terbury in New Zealand estimated the
world population of sooty shearwaters
at “one thousand million.” From there
the numbers drop sharply.

US. Fish and Wildlife Service stud-
ies conclude that North America pro-
duced only 62 million ducks in 1985, a
number which takes in ten of the most
noticeable species. Shorebirds, which
we see in large ﬂocks, seldom amount
to a million in a species. Says Peter
Myers of the Philadelphia Academy of
Natural Sciences, “We see a lot of
them in many places, but because of
the habitat we ’re living in, we’re seeing
most of them. They come across as very
common, but they’re not.” House
ﬁnches, which we might guess from fa-
miliarity are hugely abundant, are vil-
lage birds with restricted habitat. No
reptiles or amphibians come close to
bird numbers.

VEN MOST INSECTS are less nu-

merous than people. But several
species of ants and bees outnumber us.
Says Terry Erwin of the Smithsonian
Institution’s Department of Ento-
mology, “Some particular species of
ant are estimated to have 1018 individ-
uals. In some species of termite on the
African savannah, you could take a
mound apart and ﬁnd two million in-

.‘1‘1

dividuals” and go on to ﬁnd, say,
thirty such mounds in an acre, and
millions of such acres. “The world
record,” says Harvard University biol-
ogist Edward Wilson, “is now held by
a Japanese species, Formica yessemz's,
a single colony of which on the
Hokkaido coast had 300 million work-
ers and a million queens." There are
probably a million times more ants
than people on Earth. Among aphids
and small beetle species which special-
ize on ornamental crops and tree spe-
cies in the northern temperate zone,
says Wilson,‘ ‘it would not be extraor-
dinary to ﬁnd ten billion individuals.”

Erwin believes there are as many as
30 million different species of 1nsect.
Says Wilson, “A large number of spe-
cies are represented at any given time
by a few hundred thousand or a few
million. The ants, termites, social bees
and wasps, make up 75 percent of all
insect biomass. A small number are ex-
cessively abundant, in the trillions or
hundreds of billions. Most species are
relatively uncommon."

The species that are apt to far out-
number us are those we can ’t easily
see. They are subterranean creatures,
ocean dwellers, or things too small for
us to take much notice of. In the
oceans the numbers grow spectacularly
large. For decades the North Atlantic
ﬁshery alone yielded over 400 million
cod a year.

The numbers can be astronomical.
Richard Rosenblatt of the Scripps Insti-
tution in California observes that at its
height the Peruvian anchovy ﬁshery
yielded 14 million tons of ﬁsh a year
to commercial ﬁshermen and anorher
four to six million to seabirds. He does

a rough calculation. “Each anchovetta
probably weighed a couple of ounces.
Say eight ﬁsh to a pound. Multiply it
out: 320 billion. That’s not the whole
population, jusr what’s being caught.”
According to Paul Smith of the Na-
tional Marine Fisheries Service, just
the central subpopulation of northern
anchovy, in the coastal waters off Cal-
ifornia, was more than 25 billion in
a recent year. '
Anchovies live in coastal waters and
may be rare compared with some
small, nonschooling ﬁsh that live in the
open ocean. Marine scientists think a
one-inch, silvery, bristle-toothed mid-
ocean ﬁsh of the genus Cyclot/Jone
may be the world’s most abundant
vertebrate, numbering in the trillions.
Elbert Ahlstrom of the US. Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries in 1965 calcu-
lated from the number of larvae col-
lected in deep-water hauls that another
one-inch mid-ocean ﬁsh, Vz'nczguemkz
lucetz'a, was even more common.

Smaller sea creatures can be aston-
ishingly abundant. There are probably
quadrillions of the Antarctic krill, Eu-
pbaurz'a ruperba, a one-inch, shrimp-
like creature that is the food of baleen
whales and occurs in vast swarms
throughout southern waters. Biologists
have recorded densities of thirty-ﬁve
pounds per cubic yard of ocean. One
authority claims that, in the days be-
fore whales were hunted, they con-
sumed 150 million tons of krill a year,
an annual harvest of something like 45
trillion individuals.

Marine copepods, one-inch shrimp-
like crustaceans, are even more abun-
dant. Copepods constitute 70 percent
of the plankton in the oceans and are
thought to consume half the pho-
tosynthetic production of the sea’s
plants. There are 6,000 known species,
but a few of the genus Ca/anur are in-
credibly abundant and widely distrib-
uted. Eggs of one species, Acartz'a
c/azm', have been, counted as thick as
3.4 million per square meter of ocean
bottom.

To ﬁnd such numbers among land
creatures, we have to look at smaller
and smaller things. David Pimentel of
Cornell University estimates there are
at least 10,000 insects and billions of
mites and collembolans per acre of
habitat in upState New York: “I’d say
you could touch a billion mites in a
hectare. I could grossly estimate that
with a mite species you’d be into the
trillions.” Bacteria are simply un-
countable. “With millions in a hand-
ful of soil,” says Wilson, “they just
dwarf the human population.”

EOUNG AT NUMBERS this way
is something relatively new to us.
Before we wrote books on the subject,
we lived more intimately with other
creatures and saw them as individuals.

Subsistence hunters believe animals
have individual spirits which return to
Earth in new bodies after a creature is
slain for food. 80, overall numbers
were of little use to early hunters. Even
our ﬁrst formal naturalists, the Greek
and Roman writers, seldom considered
quantity. Aristotle and Pliny make no
mention of animal numbers.

It wasn’t until Europeans began ex-
ploring distant shores that they discov-
ered abundance. When they reached
Africa and the New World, they saw
landscapes unaffected by agriculture
and ﬁrearms, and they encountered
life in such numbers that it amazed
them. Sir Walter Raleigh declared of
the New World that “in all the world
the like abundance is not to be
found.” Coronado, in giving the ﬁrst
European account of the buffalo, re-
marked not on their size but their
abundance: “I found such a quantity,
that it is impossible to number them.”

In the 17th Century the English ad-
venturer Thomas Morton wrote of
“millions of turtledoves” in Massachu-
setts. George and Leonard Calvert
wrote of Maryland’s “inﬁnite number
of birds. . . by all which it appears that
the country abounds not only with
proﬁt but with pleasure.”

An 18th Century visitor to the
banks of Newfoundland declared, “It
seemed as if all the Fowles of Air were
gathered thereunto. They so bemused
the eye with their perpetual comings
and goings that their number quite
deﬁed description. There can be but
few places on Earth where is to be seen
such a manifestation of the fecundity
of His Creation.” Peter Martyr wrote in
1516 that explorer john Cabot found
off Newfoundland “so great a quantity
of great ﬁsh that at times they even
stayed the passage of his ships.”

Counting absolute numbers of such
creatures has never appealed to science.
Until recently, naturalists were mostly
interested in discovering and naming
species. It wasn’t until the 18705——
when Darwin and others were count-
ing earthworms in soils to show that
seemingly insigniﬁcant creatures had
done more than man to shape the
world—that numbers began to play
much of a role in biology. Even today,
few scientists look at overall numbers.
The uncertainties posed by vast terri-
tories and differing habitats make ac-
curacy elusive. Says Tony Sinclair, “It’s
not a very useful question. It’s only rel-
evant when you get down to rare ani-
mals and probabilities of extinction.”

But outside of science, we have
tended to see animal numbers as the
measure of Earth ’5 abundance. Animal
abundance particularly led Americans
to believe in material abundance. Mar-
tyr declared, “By reason of the rank-
ness and fruitfulness of the ground,
kine, swine, and horses do marvelously
increase in these regions, and grow to a
much bigger quantity.” A character in
the 1605 play EartwardHo! says of Vir-
ginia, “Wild boar there is as common

as our tamest bacon, and venison as
mutton.” The dollar became a “buck”
after frontier traders reckoned prices in
deerskins, and the buffalo’s image ap-
peared on American currency.

The vast numbers of creation in the
New World even did much to shape so-
ciety. They suggested from the start
that there were more than enough re-
wards for those who strove. A demo-
cratic system, declared historian David
Potter, depends upon the existence of
an economic surplus, which in Amer-
ica derived from the natural wealth of
the continent. European societies were
class-bound especially because they
had reached the limits of their natural
resources. Observed Potter, “The Eu-
ropean mind often assumes implicitly
that the volume of wealth is ﬁxed; that
most of the potential wealth has al-
ready been converted into actual
wealth. . . Europe has always conceived
of redistribution of wealth as necessi-
tating the expropriation of some and
the corresponding aggrandizement of
others." But Americans believe wealth
still remains to be found, and they ad-
dress social problems not by taxing the
rich but by seeking to increase produc-
tive capacity. Because abundance and
freedom are so intermingled in the
American mind, it is hard to say which
one is the means and which the end.

As humankind multiplies itself and
reduces the abundance of other crea-
tures available to our eyes, our views of
both are likely to change. More and
more, the teeming life we see is hu-
man, jostling one another on city
streets, staring blankly from refugee
camps in Africa. Less frequently do we
see the sky dark with birds or feel the
ground rumble with hoofbeats.

We describe ourselves more in the
terms we used to reserve for ants and
termites and lemmings. Elliott Norse
of the Ecological Society of America
says, “I don’t think there’s anything
magical about the number ﬁve billion.
If people were each the size of a bacte-
rium, we could all conveniently ﬁt on a
dead chipmunk and do our thing. Un-
fortunately, we’re not. It’s the number
of us times our size—in other words,
out biomass—~that counts.”

We see ourselves less and less in the
eyes of wolves and bears and eagles.
We identify more and more with crea-
tures whose strategies of life entail
huge reproductive potential and a care-
lessness of death. We borrow our ideas
of abundance now from a biology that
uses numbers to describe a situation
that is out of whack, an environment
in which human development has
squeezed out natural species or over.
bred insect pests.

It may not be coincidental that, as
the buffalo fades from the back of the
nickel, we, like the Europeans, now ar-
gue who is going to pay the largest
share of the tax burden. There is much
to be said for having abundance
around just to guide our daydreams, to
keep us friendly and civil, and to give

us hope. 3.

Private Organization Requests
Protection of wildlife

A new domestic law is to be established to work in conjunction
with the "Washington Treaty" [CITES], which places prohibitions and
controls on commercial dealing in endangered species of wildlife.
Yesterday Kujiraoka Heisuke, former head of the Environment Agency,
and honorary chairman of Traffic Japan, called upon Minister Tamura of
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (HITI), and Director
lnamura of the Environment agency, and asked that 6 items be included
in the new domestic law. These 6 items include: (I) The new law
should cover all the species which are covered by CITES; (2) controls
should be placed not only on transfers, but also on possession; (3)
there should also be provisions for the return of wildlife obtained in
dealing prohibited by CITES.

The bill for the new domestic law is to be submitted to the Diet
by the Environment Agency in March, and at present the Environment
ﬁgency is discussing the bill with the relevant ministries and
agencies. According to the draft worked out by the Environment Agency
and MITI, the new domestic law will in general prohibit the internal
transfer of wildlife, principally those approximately 500 species
listed in "Appendix I" of CITES, for which international trade is
prohibited. Violators will be prosecuted, and there will also be
provisions for confiscation. It looks as though including provisions
for return will be difficult.

However, Traffic Japan insists that the law should cover all of
the approximately 850 species listed by CITES, including those in
"Appendix II" and "Appendix III," which may be imported if the
exporting country has granted permission.

Japan Lounterpart of CITES Fakes Shape

lhe general framework of a new Japanese law meant to enhance
compliance with the "Washington Convention“ {CITES}, which protects
wildlife in danger of extinction, was determined yesterday by the
Environment Agency and the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry {Mill}. Concerned principally with species for which the
convention forbids international commerCial dealing, the new law in
general prohibits the transier of {endangered species} within Japan,
and prescribes punishment in case of violation. ?he law also prcvides
for confiscation, but at present it increasingly looks as though it
will be dilficult to include a provision for the return of {imported
wildlife} to the countries from which they were exported. There was
dispute as to which government office "* the Environment Agency or
HIT] w~ would submit the bill to the Diet, but both sides have now
agreed that it will be submitted by the Environment agency. The draft
worked out by the two offices will now be used as the basis for
negotiations among the other concerned ministries and agencies, after
which plans call for the bill to be submitted to the Diet in March.

ﬁccording to the draft, ill the transfer of controlled species
within Japan is prohibited; however, such transfer can be 'ade for
purposes of academic research or breeding if the Director of the
Environment Agency has recognized the validity of the purpose and
granted his consent; i2} the printipal extent of the controls will be
the approximately sun species such as gorillas and tigers that are
listed in ”ﬁppendix l” of CITES, which forbids ihternational
commercial trading; if a species listed in “Appendix ll“ is recogn' ed
to be in danger of extinction, it too will become subject to contr i:
ii) violators will be punished; i4) wildlife which has been illega ly

CONCERN is rising both in the US and
in Britain over the environmental
effects of tin-based antifouling paint. These
paints carry an active component called tri-
n-butyl tin (TBT) and are applied to
marine vessels and structures to prevent
incrustation by shellﬁsh.

The paints disrupt marine ecosystems,
and are particularly harmful to oysters.
Other effects are less visible. Now, there are
indications that TBT can enter the human
food chain.

Scientists in the US have warned that
salmon reared in sea-pens by ﬁsh farmers
can be contaminated with poisonous
organotin compounds.

Researchers from the US’s National
Marine Fisheries Service in Alaska found
that Chinook salmon can absorb the
compounds from antifouling paint on the
pens where the ﬁsh are reared.

Pens at an Alaskan research station run
by the service were coated in 1983 to
prevent them becoming clogged with
marine crustaceans. This improves circu-
lation of water and oxygen in the pen.
TBT was thought to be barely soluble in
sea water, so the researchers saw no risk to
the ﬁsh in the pen. Yet the researchers,
Jeffrey Short and Frank Thrower, soon
found young ﬁsh dying for no ap arent
reason. Further investigations conﬁrmed
that TBT dissolving in the water was
responsible.

TBT residues in the muscular tissue of
the ﬁsh reached concentrations of 0-9
micrograms per gram of tissue.

In the US, it is standard practice for

 

salmon farmers to coat pens with paints
containing TBT. So Short and Thrower
bought ﬁsh sold on markets in Seattle and
Portland to check for TBT contamination.
They found concentrations of organic tin,
including TBT, up to 0-2 micrograms per
gram of salmon tissue. Only four of the 15
salmon examined contained no TBT.

The researchers warn that cooking does
not destroy or remove the compounds
from the ﬁsh.

Meanwhile in Britain, the government

has threatened to ban the use of tin-based

antifoulants altogether. A partial ban is in
effect at the moment.

William Waldegrave, Britain’s environ-
ment minister, announced recently that
restrictions on TBT use would come into
immediate effect in the Norfolk Broads.
Here, the levels of waterborne TBT exceed
“considerably” the government’s target
concentration of 20 nanograms per litre.

Quoting preliminary results from last
year’s TBT monitoring programme, he
pointed out that TBT levels exceed the
limit in six of the nine estuaries studied.
The worst-affected area is the Norfolk
Broads, which are congested with pleasure
boats. The organotin compounds leach
from paint used to coat the hulls of the
vessels. This year’s Broads monitoring
programme will be expanded, he added.

Waldegrave delivered a sharp rebuke to
Britain’s Paintmakers’ Association (PMA).
“I have warned them that unless there is a
marked improvement in the monitoring
results in the ﬁrst half of the year—which I
am advised seems unlikely—the govern-

Tin from paint is found in salmon ﬂesh

ment will have to consider further
measures . . . which might include a ban on
the use of some or all organotin
compounds in antifouling paints intended
for small boats,” Waldegrave said.

The minister has asked the PMA to
restrict immediately the sale of TBT-based
paints in the Broads area.

In the US, TBT is causing trouble along
the Paciﬁc coast. Legislators are moving in
several states to investigate its use and envi-
ronmental impact. Some have already
demanded a ban. Marine scientists in Cali-
fornia say it is wiping out marine life in
marinas from California to Alaska.

Tests by scientists at the Scripps Institu-
tion of Oceanography in La Jolla found
traces of the substance in 60 Californian
marinas. Some of the harbours were devoid
of plant and animal life. “It’s a potential
DDT of the waterways,” Edward Goldberg,
a chemist at Scripps, said last ‘week. [3

Old Diseases in N ew World

 

By JOEL E. COHEN

 

_—_

When white men and women set off
from Europe to explore. colonize and sub-
due the earth, they did not travel alone.
From the 10th century onward, they car-
ried with them what Alfred W. Crosby,
professor of American Studies at the Uni-
versity of Texas, Austin, calls their port.
manteau blame-weeds and seeds, shoots
and fruits, ﬂeas and honeybees, rats, cats,
dogs, goats, pigs, sheep, aSSes, horses and
cattle; and, as inﬂuential as any of these,
infectious and parasitic diseases: small-
pox, measles, influenza, tuberculosis, sexu-
ally transmitted diseases, worms and hosts
of others unknown and unnamed.

Where European efforts at colonization
succeeded most dramatically, in North
America, southern South America, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. the portmanteau
biota collaborated with the human in-
vaders in pulling the ecological rug from
under the indigenes.

. “Perhaps,” Mr. Crosby argues in his
new book, “The Biological Expansion of
Europe, 900-1900" (Cambridge University
Press, 368 pages, $22.95), “the success of
European imperialism has a biological, an
ecological, component.”

In 1291, two Vivaldi brothers, intending
to circle Africa, sailed from Genoa past Gi°
braltar, to oblivion. The first Europeans to
venture far into the warm Atlantic, they
were soon followed by others, who redis-
covered what Pliny in the first century
called the Fortunate Isles: the Canaries,
the Madeiras and the Azores.

In these little-known laboratories of co-
lonialism, the Europeans learned how to
Europeanize a land for their own ease and
comfort. Passing ships seeded the Azores
with sheep. cattle and goats. The captain
of the colony on the island of Porto Santo
in the Madeiras introduced a single female
rabbit and her offspring. The resulting rab
bits ate everything the colonists could
grow. The colonists had to retreat to the is-
land of Madeira, presumably leaving the
triumphant rabbits to starve. Later colo-
nists were to set off elsewhere similar pop-
ulation explosions of burros, rats, more
rabbits and, of course, humans.

Burning Madeira’s great forests and re-
placing them with sugar cane to feed an in
satiable European market required slaves.
The first slaves in the Atlantic slave trade
were not black, but the olive-skinned
Guanches of the Canary Islands.

The Guanches had to battle men on
horseback when they had never seen an
animal as large as a horse before. More le-
thally, the Guanches suffered from new ill-
nesses that arrived with the Spaniards. On
Gran Canaria, an epidemic destroyed be-
tween two-thirds and three—quarters of the
Guanches. 0n Tenerife, another pestilence,

perhaps typhus, obliterated all but a hand- .

ful of them.

These were “virgin-soil epidemics,”
. outbreaks of communicable diseases
among people never before exposed to
them. Such epidemics make infected indi-
viduals extremely sick before they die and
kill nearly all the infected, .often leaving
too few survivors to care for the ill, bury

the dead, or plant and harvest food for the
future. Those skeptical of the potential de—
mographic and cultural impact of AIDS,
now a virgin-soil epidemic in the U.S. and
elsewhere, would do well to have their
imaginations enlarged by reading about
such epidemics here.

As the Guanches were defeated militar-
ily, sold into slavery, killed by infection or
exiled to die abroad, the Europeans trans-
formed the Canaries. They brought cattle,
chickens, ducks, grapes, melons, pears and
apples. By 1520, the European elite consid-
ered the Canaries a part of Europe.

Euroreans learned from the Canaries
that they and their plants and animals
could prosper famously in new lands. Once
European sailors understood the prevailing
ocean winds, they and their masters set to
creating new ecological colonies. In the
half millennium after Columbus, “Neo-Eu-
ropes”—-regions dominated by people of
European origin accompanied by plants
and animals of Old World Neolithic ori-
gin-replaced indigenous cultures in Can-
ada and the U.S., Argentina and Uruguay,
Australia and New Zealand.

Mr: Crosby suggests that two essential
factors distinguished what have become

of Europe, 900-190l ”

By Alfred W. Crosby

 

NeoEuropes from other areas of at-
tempted European colonization that are
today neither demographically nor ecologi-
cally European, such as Greenland, the
tropics, Siberia and southern Africa.
The first, and an obvious, factor is that
the target had to have land and climate
like those of some part of Europe. The sec-
ond, far from obvious, factor is that the
target had to be very remote ecologically
from Europe. Sufficiently remote regions
had few large predators and few small
parasites, pests and plagues adapted to
preying on Europeans and their portman~
teau biota. The human inhabitants of such
remote lands had no resistance to the dis-
ease complexes of dense Old World settle—

. ments.

This explanation calls for another. Why
did today’s Neo-Europes then have few
large predators and few diseases of hu-
mans, animals or plants to which the in-
vading European biota fell prey?..-I will not
steal Mr. Crosby’s thunder, revealed in a
brilliant, frankly speculative chapter.

In telling his very readable story. Mr.
Crosby combines a historian’s taste for c0!-
0th detail with a scientist’s hunger for
unifying and testable generalizations. He
exploits a truly astonishing range of pri-
mary and secondary sunrises. " all docu—

wonder how libraries will classify these

books, all telling of the Rainbow Warrior’s

untimely end. Will they split them up into
different sections or will they put them side by
side on the same shelf?

The stories they tell can be divided into
three categories: (1) spy-cum-detective—non-
fiction. of course (all four of the books inevit-
ably fit into this); (2) politics—specifically that
of international terrorism and sanctions (none
of the four is very illuminating from this point
of view, perhaps because they were all com-
pleted too soon): (3) history—specifically the
history of the environmental movement.
Readers attracted by the potential of the last
category may be rather disappointed, but
they should find something of interest in the
early chapters of each book, especially if they
have not read any of several books about the
nascence of Greenpeace.

Greenpeace is known as an organisation
that opposes. variously. pollution of the sea by
toxic and radioactive wastes and of the atmos-
phere and land by acid discharges, the testing
of nuclear weapons, the killing of whales and
the irradiation of indigenous island peoples.
The accent is on demonstrative opposition
but. as John Dyson writes, the emphasis has
always been on ’green' rather than on ‘peace'.

The organisation is committed to Ghandian
non-violence as the means to its ends, but we

should not be surprised by the paradox that its
actions attract some violent responses. That
violence is mainly verbal and threatening, as
from Newfoundland sealers and Icelandic and
Norwegian whalers. Occasionally violence
erupts in the heat of the moment, as when bar-
rels of radioactive waste were dropped from a
British ship on a Greenpeace inﬂatable. But
calculated violent response from authority is
rare, and the authority involved is as often as
not French.

The Soviet authorities did not execute , nor
even imprison, the Greenpeacers who went
ashore to protest against Siberian whaling, nor
even did the US government make much fuss
about those who penetrated the Nevada test-
ing grounds and so delayed the recent series of
bomb tests. Common sense would suggest that
to do otherwise would merely add to the
unwanted publicity and thus serve Green-
peace’s ends.

But the French have had it in for Green-
peace ever since 1973, when marines boarded
the yacht Vega, which was protesting against
atmospheric tests in the South Pacific, and
beat up its skipper (David McTaggart. now
chairman of Greenpeace International) and
his crew. After this incident, French policy
appears to have been moved more by spite

ciates, constitutes a report to an
inter-govemmental task force
set up by the Development
Committee of the World Bank
and the International Monetary
Fund. Cassen embarked on the
project to gauge the value of aid
and meet the criticisms often
made of it.

Does Aid Work?, therefore,
covers the effects of aid in
macroeconomic terms; its
consequences for economic
development and the alleviation

of poverty; the framework in .

which donors and recipients
work together; the place of tech-
nical cooperation; and the part
which could or should be played
by private enterprise. At the
end, Cassen lists the conclusions
and recommendations, most of
which were broadly accepted by
the task force and later by the
Development Committee.

In general terms, the report
will stand as a sensible and
realistic examination of a diffi-
cult subject—one which tends
to engender rhetoric, wishful
thinking and idealism as well as
hard politics, commerce and

ties as well as exacerbating old
ones. I am not sure that thlS
point is sufficiently brought'out
in Cassen’s report.

Nor do I think that the
authors look sufficientl into
the why and wherefors o aid as
a historical phenomenon. At
some places in the report, there
seems to be an unspoken
assumption that the rest of the
world should adopt the develop-
ment of the industrial countries
as its blueprint. Such an idea is
being undermined by the vast
increase in human numbers; the
degradation of the environment
in many areas (a subject scrap
pily dealt with in the report); the
uneven distribution of the
world’s resources; the difﬁcul-
ties many countries have in
feeding themselves; the poor
commercial prospects for the
commodities on which they
depend for their export earn-
ings; and the sheer diverging
diversity of the world economy.

The motives and attitudes of
aid donors need fairer treatment

than by acumen. If. as the subtitle to the
Insight book implies. the sinking of the Rain-
bow Warrior was part of ‘The French attempts
to sink Greenpeace’ itself. it was extraordin-
arily inept: “You can't sink a rainbow.” as the
T-shirts and posters say.

I‘m told that after the bombing. Green-
peace membership and funds increased in all
countries in which it has offices—except
France, where the native chauvinism has been
nurtured. That country has always been par-
ticularly “sensitive to matters nuclear: hence
the jokes about why the cloud of death from
. Chernobyl did not dare to cross the frontier
from Switzerland.

Greenpeace certainly did get some benefit
from the affair, but to suggest. as some have.
that the organisation had bombed itself. for
publicity, is pernicious nonsense. which these
books put in its proper place. What they don't
expand on is the damage done indirectly to
Greenpeace‘s carefully guarded non-violent
image—for the odour of violence rubs off on
the violated, and the image in the public mind
cannot now be one only of peaceful protest.

The bombing was inept at several levels.
Only one crew member. the unlucky Por-
tuguese photographer. was killed: political
purposes 'would have been better served if all
had been killed. or none. Then the perpet-
rators got found out. and some of them got
caught—careless! But if they had not. would
no one have claimed responsibility? If not.
then how could the argument be sustained that
the bombing was essentially a warning from
the French powers-that-be that their patience
with the antics of Greenpeace was becoming
exhausted?

All the books address the questions of who
planned and who authorised this act of state
terrorism. and why. King quotes a letter to
the New Zealand prime minister from the
president of France: "I wish to tell you how
much I and the government of the Republic
abhor the criminal attack committed on your

territory which no excuse can justify.“ This
pinpoints one of the pitfalls of early publica-

that most aid is successful in
terms of its own objectives-—
should help to reassure those
who sometimes see it as a slush
fund, a prop for corrupt g0vern-
ments, an export subsrdy for
industry, or simply a waste of
taxpayers’ money.

In itself, aid is neither good
nor had. It represents only a
small proportion of the total
ﬂow of resources from industrial
nations to other countries. The
correlation between aid giving
and economic growth in reci-
pient countries is weak
(although it is strong in particu-
lar cases). But whatever form
aid takes, and however big or
small its effects, we must
recognise that aid amounts to
interference by one country in
the affairs of another, and that,
in some ways, it is an attempt at
social and economic engineer-
ing. Donors cover a wide spec-
trum; some who are ready to
recognise their responsibilities
in this respect, and those who
prefer not to do so, thereby
incurring—in my view—a still
greater responsibility.

The name given to the exer-
cise of that responsibility is
conditionality, or the imposi-
tion of conditions on the use of
aid. Donors have made mistakes
enough in the past, though
usually in imposing too few
conditions rather than too
many. Some may label this

But politics and commerce are
among the prime motives for
giving it at all, and donors are
sharper—eyed than they used to
be about use of tax payers’
money. Hence their new insist-
ence on the adoption of policies
liable to lead to effective econo-
mic management.

In many cases, the authors
seem justiﬁed in reproaching
donors and recipients. A par-
ticular shortcoming is the failure
of both to look at economic
problems with a sufﬁciently
long perspective, and to coor-
dinate their actions accordingly.
Cassen brings out the import-
ance of the international ﬁnan-
cial institutions. I think we shall
see the World Bank, with
its prescriptions for macro-
economic management, occu-
pying a still more important
place in the future. The authors
rightly look at the importance of
technical cooperation, and call
for a sharper focus on the alle-
viation of poverty. Their use of
case studies helps to bring out
these points.

For those new to the subject,
the report is, perhaps, a little
heavy on acronyms, and the
style is, at times, ponderous. But
it represents a useful picture of
the functioning of the aid busi-
ness at a time when well-
directed and controlled aid
could help to shape a better,
balanced world economy. I]

ANY species of mammals are.
disappearing from North
America’s national parks
solely because the parks -

even those covering hundreds of thousands

of acres -- are too small to support them.
New research has found a striking loss
of species in the great Western parks, from
grizzly bear to red fox to white-tailed jack-
rabbit, on a scale unrecognized by wildlife
officials. Parks as vast as Yosemite and

Mount Rainier have lost more than one—

fourth of the species originally found there,

and smaller parks have lost as many as 35

to 40 percent.

As roads, housing development and de-
forestation take hold around park bound-
aries, they isolate animal populations in re-
gions that seemed like spacious havens
when the parks were established 70 to 90
years ago. By then some species had al-
ready been killed off or driven out of the
park areas.

But the first complete survey of major

 

' mammal populations throughout the West-

ern parks, published in the current issue of
Nature, shows that the loss has not abated.

“it’s extraordinarily important informa-
tion,” said Michael Soulé, a research fel-
low at the National Zoological Park in
Washington and the president of the Soci-
ety for Conservation Biology. “The scale is
beyond anything that people had appreci-
ated or feared, and it's bound to have an
important impact on the management of
the national park system and of wildlands
in general in the United States."

Although individual park managers and.

scientists had noted some of the local ex-
tinctions, few appreciated a trend that took
shape over the better part of a century,
and none realized how universal the pat-
tern of species loss was across the conti-
nent. Because there is often a long lag be-
tween disturbance and disappearance, the
loss now seems likely to continue even
without further development around the
parks.

“What you find is that most nature re-
serves are becoming isolated or insular?
ized because of a variety of disturbances
beyond their boundaries,” said the study’s

author, William D. Newmark, an ecologist
now at the College of African Wildlife Man-
agement in Moshi, Tanzania. “The big
question now is how many species can we
expect to disappear and what is the time
period."

None of the mammal species have be-
come extinct worldwide. Animals that
have vanished from some parks seem to be
thriving in others, and several species that
are jeopardized in the continental United

States seem safe in Canada and Alaska.
But some ecologists see the Newmark
survey as a gloomy signal for the future.

“One of the messages of his study is that
certain species are prone to extinction -- if
they go extinct in park A they may also go
extinct in parks B, C and D," said Jared
Diamond, an ecologist at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ”Big predators

like grizzly bears are a prime exam-
ple. if you find that they’ve already
gone extinct in five national parks,
you’ve got to expect they’re in danger
of going extinct in. the remaining
seven national parks.”

The findings confirm a theoretical
idea put forward by Dr. Diamond and
other ecologists 15 years ago: that
nature reserves are like new-made is-
lands — so-called land-bridge islands
—- cut off from continents by rising
seas or changing topography. 0n real
land-bridge islands, the full ecologi-
cal diversity of the mainland cannot
be sustained. The result is “faunal
collapse.”

More than ever before, the survey
finds, the parks are becoming true is-
lands — “pieces of natural habitat
that become isolated in a sea of man-
made habitat,” as Dr. Diamond put it.
The result is the same. Even small
roads and fences can effectively cut
off bighom sheep or striped skunk
from the outside.

BiologiSts have long known that is-
lands far from shore have very few
species compared with continents.

But it was far from obvious that a

newly created island should fail to
sustain the same range of animals
and plants that originally thrived
there. , .

One reason is that isolated popula-
tions become less robust in bad times,
ecologists find. “The ultimate cause
of an extinction is that the population
size is too small,” Dr. Newmark said.
“The proximate cause may be some-
thing like disease or storm.”

The findings are sure to.intensify
debate on the operation of parks and
their surrounding lands. Some ecolo-
gists -- including those who. formerly
considered nonintervention an article
of faith -- are arguing for active,
creative management.

“When I got into this business,” Dr.
Diamond said, “I had the naive hope
that a lot of biologists shared, that
what you need to do is set up a na-
tional park and keep your hands off it
— nature will take care of itself.
That’s fine if you’ve got a perfectly
gigantic national park, but when you
set up a small national park, you cut
off all kinds of natural processes."

Some ecologists are proposing
more careful management of lands
adjacent to the parks - a politically
contentious matter, even though
much of the land is federally owned.

And within parks, officials could de-
velop ways of compensating. In some
parks, managers have already ex-
perimented with simply bringing in
new animals. Ecologists have also

difficult issue whether we want to
manage parks as living ecosystems
or for the benefit of a particular spe-
cies or assemblage of species,” Dr.
Newmark said. -

Scientists at the individual parks
are struggling with the dilemma. For
example, at Yellowstone National
Park, an enormous reserve that‘has
lost relatively few species, research-
ers are looking for ways of replacing
species that cannot sustain them-
selves without help over the long

“Most of the parks were set apart

we hadn’t even invented the word
ecosystem,” said John Varley, re—.
search administrator at Yellowstone.
Yet it is the pre-civilization ecosys-
tem that park managers most want
to preserve. '

"The park philosophy, as articu-
lated in legislation and in policy,
strives to create a situation where
natural processes are left alone,” he
said. “You run into. a situation in
which you’re going against the very
. tenets for which the parks were

Both in theory and in the real world, :

some of the consequences of species
loss are still not clearly understood.

For example, when some species ‘_

have vanished, some ecologists — but
not all - believe'that the pressure on
the remaining species relaxes. Sec-
ondary effects are also possible: the

disappearance of large predators can .

cause growth of small predators, and
that in turn can lead to the disappear-
ance of even smaller animals.

in conducting his survey, part of his
doctbral dissertation, Dr. Newmark
visited all the parks, developed
checklists and reviewed sighting
records going back decades. He listed
a specres as locally extinct Only when
ithad failed to be sighted for at least
10 years.

In a few cases, species such as elk
and bison reappeared in parks, either
naturally or with human help. in a
few cases, human intervention was
responsible for a disappearance.
Jackrabbits, for example, were acci-
dentally poisoned in Sequoia-King’s
Canyon. But the overwhelming ma-
jority of changes were natural losses
of species.

Larger animals proved most vul-
nerable, since their population densi-
ties are smallest. Older” parks had
suffered more losses. Only the very
largest par-k grouping — the combi-
nation of Kootenay, Banff, Jasper and
Yoho in Canada —— seemed com-
pletely immune.

The survey was restricted to mam-
mals, the species most reliably ob-
served by pa'rk scientists and visi-
tors. On land-bridge islands, faunal
collapse also affects small animals,
birds and plants; whether it will in

Outdoors—Report Won’t See Light of Day

Not Even Panel Members Can View National Recreation Study

 

By Cass Peterson
Washington Post Staff Writer

 

The President’s Commission on
Americans Outdoors has completed
its voluminous report on the na-
tion’s future recreational needs, but
not even the 15 commissioners
have been allowed to see it.

The Interior Department, which
received the report when the com-
mission closed shop last week, has
declined to make it public on the
advice of the Justice Department.
Also under lock and key are more
than 48,000 copies of a slick mag-
azine-style “executive summary,”
hundreds of copies of which were
distributed at a news conference
last month.

According to Interior spokesman
Alan Levitt, Justice lawyers decided
not to release either document
pending a hearing next month on a
lawsuit challenging the commis-
sion’s procedures. The suit was

filed by the Center for the Defense .

of Free Enterprise on behalf of pri-
vate landholders Who oppose the
commission’s recommendations.
The withholding of the report
came as a surprise to the center, a
private-interest law firm based in
Seattle. “We don’t know anything
ibout that,” said executive director

Ron Arnold, who said attorneys for,

his group did not request a tempo-
rary restraining order to stop dis-
tribution of the report.

The center is seeking a prelim-
inary injunction to block adoption of
the full report, which it believes
was written in violation of the Fed—
eral_Advisory Committees Act. But
Arnold said it had no objection to
the executive summary, a 30-page
booklet that contains more pictures
than text. “That is merely fluff,” he
said. “We’re not worried about that
at all. It’s a puff piece.”

Meanwhile, even former mem-
bers of the commission, headed by
former Tennessee governor Lamar
Alexander, have been refused
copies of the 3-inch-thiCk document
that bears their signature. Some
members reportedly have been re-
duced to filing Freedom of Informa-
tion Act requests.

“We have had requests for this,”
Levitt acknowledged. “We are con-
tacting Justice to see if we can re-

lease it to the commission or under .

an FOIA request or whatever.”

The flap is the latest to beset the
commission, appointed by President
Reagan in 1985 to assess future
needs and recommend ways to pro-
vide adequate recreational oppor-
tunities for Americans. When high-

despite help from the UK. Canada and
the US. and in the past five years the
deaths of 15 buffalo, three elephants

ation of a $1 billion-a-year trust
fund, partly to acquire new recre-
ational land. It also recommended
expansion of the national scenic riV‘
ers system, to be augmented by"
new systems of scenic highways
and “greenways” linking recreation-
al areas. '

“It was a runaway grand jury,”
one administration ' official said
shortly after the initial summary
was released. _

The commission’s work was de-
nounced by several industry groups
dependent on federal land, including
cattlemen and mineral developers,
whose complaints kept the commis-
sion from completing its report un-
til last week.

The harshest criticism has come
from the National Inholders. Asso-

land within parks and recreation

areas and was the driving force be-

Policy at Heart of Feud
Inside U.S. Park Service

By RONALD B. TAYLOR, Times Staff .W'r'ite'r

During 40 years with the National
Park Service, Howard Chapman worked
his way up through the ranger ranks,
spending the last 15 years in San Fran-
cisco as the Western regional director——
all, he says, without a blemish on his
record.

Then last fall, top officials of the US.
Department of the Interior, overriding
the recommendation of Chapman’s su-

pervisor, gave the 61-year-old career

ranger a bad performance rating and
suggested that he take “immediate reas-
signment” or an early retirement.

Instead, the normally taciturn regional
director is fighting back.

News of the unfolding Chapman case
has reverberated through the tightly
knit ranks of professional rangers, com-
ing as it does on the heels of an Interior
Department effort to reorganize top park
service management and to rewrite
national park policies.

Critics of the Interior Department see
the Chapman case as “the tip of the

iceberg” in a power struggle between the
professional ranger corps, headed by
National Parks Director William Penn
Mott Jr., and the Interior Department’s
assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and
parks, William P. Horn, a pelitical ap-
pointee.

Beyond the personalities and power
struggle, there are practical effects in-
volved in the dispute, such as the number
of visitors and types of recreation al-
lowed in the national park system. Mott
and Chapman represent the professional
ranger corps that wants to limit recrea-
tional use so that natural and historic
resources are preserved for future gen-
erations.

Horn believes that the national parks
should be accessible to a greater number
of people for recreational use without
impairing the parks. He believes, for
. example, that aircraft flights carrying
airborne tourist-s can be continued
through the Grand Canyon without any
harmful effects.

Horn’s reorganizational efforts
are only the latest Interior Depart-
ment attempt to “change the fun-
damental, long-established policies
of the National Park Service,” said
T. Destry Jarvis, Vice president of
the National Parks and Conserva-
tion Assn. “They’ve tried to do this
before and failed because of the
professionals like Chapman who
have fought to protect the parks.”

Tim Mahoney, the Sierra Club’s
representative in Washington,
charged that Horn “has an amuse-
ment park mentality and he’s try-
ing to write this into the service’s
policies.”

Until Chapman decided to talk
openly, the struggle between sen-
ior park service professionals and
the political appointees in the Inte-
rior Department had been taking
place out of public view. This case
has focused attention on the man-
agement shake-up and propoSed
policy changes.

In Congress, a House Interior
subcommittee is holding a hearing
today to question Horn and Mott
about the management shake-up
and the House Appropriations sub-
committee that oversees Interior
Department budgets has scheduled
a hearing for later this month, said
Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.), who
called the handling of the Chapman
case “grossly unfair.” .

‘Tempest in a Teapot’

Horn called these reactions “a
tempest in a teapot,” and said the
management changes were noth-
ing more than “a realignment” that
Mott had proposed. Mott, upset by
Horn’s intervention, wrote the as-
sistant secretary, saying, “I disa-
gree with most of the suggested
modifications,” especially to the
“unnecessary” addition of four
“high-graded positions” in Wash-
ington and San Francisco at a cost
of $825,000 a year.

Horn ordered Mott, a former
director of California’s state parks
system, to reassign three out of the
four associate directors to other
jobs and to create a fifth associate
directorship. At least two of the
vacancies have been filled by exec-
utives from outside the park ser-
vice, a shift away from the policy of
filling senior management jobs
from within the ranger ranks.

In addition, Horn has counter-

j manded Mott’s appointment of a
‘ new Pacific Northwest regional

director, putting in a man of his
own choice instead. , ,

Horn is personally supervising a
major revision of the park service
policy manual because, he said, the
nation’s population 'is expanding,
creating an increasing need for a
wide range of outdoor recreational
opportunities. The park service will
have to come up with “creative”
new ways to meet that need, he
said in a telephone interview.

And Horn acknowledged that his
views on how these policies should
be changed have again revived
“the age-old debate” of how to
make‘ the nation’s 337 parks, monu-
ments and play lands more access-

able to increasing numbers of visi-
tors while protecting the natural
and cultural resources that make
these areas unique. Last year, 281
million people visited these areas, a
25% increase over the figure of 10
years ago.

The debate focuses on a single
paragraph of the 1916 act creating
the National Park Service. In the
paragraph, Congress required that
rangers “conserve” the natural and
historic resources of these areas
while providing for the public “en-
joyment of the same in such man-
ner and by such means as will leave
them unimpaired for the enjoyment
of future generations.”

Traditionally, when public ,use
conflicts with protection of re-
sources, the park service has given
conservation top priority, restrict-
ing use, installing reservation sys-
tems, even closing areas entirely to
preserve them. Horn finds that
priority troubling and would like to
modify it, if not reverse it entirely.

“Unimpaired,” is the key word in
the 1916 act, according to Horn. In
a memo to Mott last November, he
warned that “impairment” is a
“highly subjective” word and
“must not be invoked to undermine
the intent of Congress to provide
for public use and enjoyment.”
Congress never “envisioned the
parks to be elitist preserves open
only to the self-selected few," he
wrote, setting out his belief that
more, not less, use was in order.

Yellowstone Threatened, Group Says

Logging, Drilling in Nearby Forests Cited ' by Widerness Society

 

By Sonja llillgren

United Press International

 

The government’s emphasis on
logging and oil and gas drilling in
forests next to Yellowstone Nation-
al Park threatens the environment
and animals of the entire region,
conservationists said yesterday;

The Wilderness Society charged
that the US. Forest Service has
paid too little attention to maintain-
ing wilderness, clean water, animals
and recreation in its plans for na-
tional forests that are part of the 13
million‘acre region.

Peter Emerson, vice president of
the Wilderness Society, said that

troubled by what I see as a growing
philosophy that We have to protect
the [park] resources at the expense
of the public."

Plans Meeting

However, Horn’s effort to offi-
cially recast. its policies is being
resisted by the professional rangers
who are rewriting the manual,
according to sources inside the
park service and Jarvis of the
National Parks and Conservation
Assn, who said: “It’s taken Horn a
year just to get the first chapter
written. . . At that rate it will
never get finished . . . so he has to
get these people out of the way.”

Horn acknowledged that the re~
write is going slower than he liked
and said, “I intend to call them in,

all get around the table and ham-_

mer this one out.”

Horn is critical of park managers
in the field who, faced with pro-
tecting a meadow or waterfall,
“find it is easier to say, ‘Let’s close
the area to the people, fence them
out.’ I want to avoid putting up
fences. . . . The government has
an obligation try to accommodate
all its citizen.” He has written, “Our
job . . . is to conserve these .re-
sources for the benefit of the
public, as opposed to protecting
them from the public.”

These are the views first ex-

pressed by former Secretary of-

Interior James Watt and Horn's

“Bl“ I am i has resisted breaking with the old

1 traditions and policies.

the Forest Service has an “invisible
handshake with development inter~
ests,” a problem “accentuated by
the Reagan administration.”

Conservationists argued that
plans for increased logging, more
roads and opening millions of acres
to oil and gas drilling in areas sur-
rounding parks and wildlife refuges
would cut up the vast wilderness,
thus restricting movement of griz-
zly bears, mountain lions, clk and
wolverines.

The area that covers parts of Wy-
oming, Montana and Idaho includes
Yellowstone and Grand Teton Na‘
tional Parks, three national wildlife

predecessor, C. Ray Arnett. They
go to the heart of the increasingly
bitter debate that now focuses on
Chapman, who for several years

Chapman began his career as a
seasonal ranger in Yellowstone,

worked his way up through the
ranks to become chief ranger of the
Blue Ridge Parkway and superin-
tendent of Grand Teton. In 1971, he
moved to San Francisco as West-
ern regional director in charge of
44 park areas in California, Nevada,
Arizona, Hawaii and the Pacific
Trust Territories. Both Yosemite
and Grand Canyon are in this
region.

He received a Meritorious Ser-
vice Award in 1971 and the depart-
ment’s Senior Executive Award.
One of Chapman’s former bosses,
Nathaniel -P. Reed, who was an
assistant interior secretary in the
Nixon and Ford administrations,
said, “Trying to force Howard
[Chapman] to retire is a terrible
mistake. He has served marvelous-
ly, with great distinction.”

Debate Over Rating

On a scale of one to five, one
being best, Mott gave Chapman a
“level two” evaluation last fall,
indicating that the regional direc-
tor had “exceeded performance
standards.” Horn wanted this re-
duCed to an unsatisfactory “level
four,’ "and recommended that
Chapman be immediately reas-
signed. Mott resisted and Horn
compromised on a “level three,”

and clearcut thousands of acres.

The greatest, long-term threat is
a fragmentation of the area’s nat-
ural habitat, said David Wilcove, a
society ecologist. '

He called for a moratorium on
logging and oil and gas drilling, an
end to sheep grazing and no new
recreational areas in grizzly bear
habitats.

Forest Service official Steve
Fitch said the National Park Service

“I’ve never had an average rat-
ing in my entire career,” Chapman
said. “Then I hear all over the
Service that I’m going to retire in

iSeptember, 1987, but I have no
'plans to retire.’ Neither Horn nor
Mott explained why his perform-
ance rating was lowered, he said.

“The change [from a high raying
to a low one] was not due to any
defendable evaluation of my per-
formance,” Chapman said. He has
contacted an attorney and said, “I
won't settle for anything less than
a level two, that’s the bottom line.”

Horn, angry because Chapman
has “gone public,” refused to com-
ment on the rating or how it was
arrived at, other than to say,
“different people raised questions
about Chapman’s performance."
He would not explain. '

_ “I believe it’s retribution,” Chap-

man said, explaining that over the
last five years he has opposed
interior Department political ap-
pointees on several issues. One of
these key issues was the rangers’
effort to restrict or ban aircraft
ﬂights inside the Grand Canyon.
Officials estimate that 50,000
ﬂights are made each year over or
through the unregulated canyon
airspace, most of them by commer-
cial r tour operators who gross $50
million a year giving! rides to
450,000 visitors.

f' ‘Flight-Free Zones’
" Park officials reported in an

environmental assessment that he-

licopter and fixed-wing aircraft

and the Forest Service recently
created a Yellowstone Area Coon
(linating Committee to avoid conJ
flicting policies, such as develop—
ment, that would harm grizzly
bears.

“I think that’s going to really take
care of the concern for fragmenta—
tion that the Wilderness Society
has,” Fitch said.

The society, a nonprofit conser«
vation organization, concluded that
some timber areas are so degraded
and eroded that they need to be

. restored.

The group charged that the For-
est Serviee plans to designate as
wilderness free from humans less
than 8 percent of 736,560 acres
recommended by conservationists.

The Forest Service also plans to
increase timber harvesting 20 per-
cent and road mileage 14 percent
and permit oil and gas leases on 85
percent of available lands.

flights below the canyon rims not
only present safety hazards, but
gcreate noise pollution that disturbs
caniyon hikers and river runners
’de in the wilderness areas of the
pare-E. Chapman recommended that
theimost frequently traveled por-
| tions of the canyon be declared
l “flight-free zones” and that all
other all flights be kept 2,000 feet
above the rim.

The recommendations were
made before the below-the-rim
midair collision of a helicopter and
a twin-engine airplane that killed
25 people last June. '

Mott later concurred with Chap-
man’s recommendation. Horn disa-
greed and scrapped the concept,
after air tour operators complained
directly to Interior Secretary Don—
ald P. Hodel. The Interior Depart—
ment turned the controversy over
to the Federal Aviation Agency,
declaring that air safety was not
within the park service’s jurisdic-
tion. The noise problems could be
studied jointly by the FAA and
park service, Horn suggested. '

“Overflights don’t cause physical
damage to the resource, but they do
have an enormous impact on the
experience of different users,"
Horn said. “Some who go into the
canyon to bike are offended by
airplanes, but when someone leans
out window of the airplane with a
camera, that is the greatest view in
the world. We need to take steps to
provide for both experiences."

 




Mountain States ’ Conservative Legal Bite Loses

Strength Due to Funding Woes, Ideological Rifts

 

By DENNIS FARNEY
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

DENVER—James Watt, that old Sierra
Club-basher, would doubtless be pleased
that something of himself endures here at
the Mountain States Legal Foundation.

“Preserve Wildlife. Freeze a Bird,”
reads a button at one work station.

But much has changed since the com-
bative Mr. Watt, Mountain States’ first
president, went off in 1981 to become Ron-
ald Reagan’s most controversial interior
secretary. And for the worse.

The fiercely conservative foundation,
established in 1977 to combat environmen-
tal groups in court, still sallies forth in the
best Watt tradition to confront the likes of
the Wilderness Society and the Sierra Club.
But its financial base, independent oilmen.
has been devastated by the collapse of the
energy boom. Last year Mountain States
had to draw down a reserve fund just to
maintain its $1 million annual budget.
Meanwhile, environmental groups are
prospering, their coffers swelled by a con-
tinuing reaction to Watt rhetoric.

And, ironically, the ideological zeal of
Mountain States lawyers, a band of free
marketeers, has alienated Joseph Coors,
the conservative Denver brewing magnate
who conceived the foundation in the first
place. He resigned from the board in pro-
test the day in 1982 that Mountain States
challenged Denver’s award of a cable-tele-
vision monopoly to a fellow Denver busi-
nessman. Worse, he took his money with
him.

“I’m steering this ship through precari-
ous seas, trying not to fall overboard to the
sharks," says president David Flitner. a
53-year-old, windburned rancher With the
look of an aging marshal in a western
movie.

Mountain States‘ focus remains "the
gut issues of the West.” as Mr. Flitner puts
it. The fights it picks are central to the on,
mining and timber industries that largely
underwrite it: Everything from Wilderness
(which it generally opposes on principle)
to the windfall profits tax on oil producers
(which it tried, and failed, to overturn in
1983).

Some adversaries argue that. quite
aside from money problems, rapid staff
turnover and a too-rigid ideology has
blunted Mountain States’ effectiveness in
recent years. “My sense is that they
haven’t been very effective,” says Karin

Sheldon, a Denver attorney with the Sierra
Club Legal Defense Fund. “Even when
they pick good cases, they sometimes take
dogmatic, out-in-right—field positions.” A
good example of that dogmatism, she says,
is the cable-TV case that so alienated bene—
factor Joseph Coors.

Yet Mountain States clearly has left a
mark on both Washington and the law. Al-
though James Watt is long gone, eight
foundation alumni still hold middle-level
posts in the Reagan administration.

It also has played a part in reshaping
the whole notion of “public interest law.“
Lntil the late Seventies, those words were
almost synonymous with “liberal.” No
longer. “They are redefining public inter-
est,’ perhaps distorting it from my per
spective.‘ says Marsha Levick, who di-
rects the legal defense fund of the National
Organization for Women. Ohio Sen. How-
ard Metzenbaum. t liberal Democrat, once
called the foundation a thinly disguised
“special interesz organization.”

But Mountain States staff members,
whose downtown headquarters overlooks
Denver smog and the snowy Front Range
beyond. see themselves as gritty under-
dogs, outmanned and outspent by environ-
mental organizations. They note the Envi
ronmental Defense Fund spends $5.5 mil—
lion a year and the Sierra Club Legal Der
tense Fund. which is separate from the
$23-million-a-year Sierra Club, spends $3
million.

“We’re puppies compared to the Sierra
Club," says executive vice president Bev-
erly Kinard.

Like their adversaries at environmental
groups, Mountain States attorneys tend to
be young and highly motivated. Their
leader is 35-year-old Constance Brooks,
dubbed “Wild Horse Connie” by the Wyo-
ming Farm Bureau for her work on a case
involving wild mustangs, who left a part-
nership in a Washington law firm to come
here. Now, as general counsel, she helps
oversee a grand strategy that has Moun-
tain States gradually broadening out be-
yond environmental issues.

Twice within the past year, Mountain
States has gone to the Supreme Court to
challenge affirmative action programs
that, in its view, led to reverse discrimina-
tion. It’s already won one, Wygant vs.
Jackson Board of Education.

Mountain States represented eight ten-
ured white teachers in Michigan, who lost
their jobs during cutbacks because school
board policy protected minorities against
layoffs. The high court, ruling for the white
teachers and narrowing the scope of af-
firmative action generally, held that past
job discrimination by society in general
isn‘t enough to trigger affirmative-action
remedies; there must be strong evidence
of discrimination by the particular em-
ployer in question. In this case, it held,
there wasn’t any such evidence that the
school board had discriminated.

Ms. Brooks, who sat at the counsel’s ta-
ble on that case, was back before the Su-
preme Court last November. This time she
presented oral arguments on behalf of
Paul Johnson. a California road worker
who lost a promotion to a woman who had
scored slightly lower on a job test.

Mr. Johnson's employer. the Transpor-
tation Agency of Santa Clara County, ar-
gued that a huge statistical imbalance m
its skilled-craft job category—238 men, no
women—was evidence on its face of past
discrimination against women that needed
correcting. But Ms. Brooks, arguing that
such statistics are insufficient evidence of
discrimination, suggested that what they
really reflect is a lack of interest by
women in becoming road workers. The Su-
preme Court is expected to hand down its
decision within a few months.

Mountain States also is prepared to
challenge the already beleaguered concept
of “comparable worth,” which aims to pro-
vide equal pay for jobs classified as
equally important, should that concept
ever get off the ground. “Comparable
worth totally displaces the marketplace,”
argues attorney Diane Vaksdal.

Still, it’s unlikely the foundation will
ever stray far from the overriding preoc-
cupations of the West: land, water and who
controls them.

Intervening in one important case under
appeal, Conner vs. Burford, Mountain
States argues that a federal district judge,
ruling on a suit brought by the Montana
Wildlife Federation, canceled 711 oil and
gas leases in a national forest without even
notifying leaseholders that a suit was in
progress.

In another, Sierra Club vs. Block, the
foundation has jumped into a classic fight
over water rights. The Sierra Club argues
that wilderness areas have the right to cer-
tain amounts of water—a position that, if
upheld, could limit water-consuming devel-
opment upstream of those areas. “It’s a
formula for western disaster,” contends
Mountain States spokesman Jon
Chandler.

With environmental groups resurgent

and its own money problems unresolved,
with Congress again in Democratic hands
and Ronald Reagan preoccupied with other
issues, a kind of rear-guard feeling seems
to pervade Mountain States headquarters.
“We’re in a hunker-down mode," concedes
President Flitner. But the zest for combat
remains.
W “The government is scared to death of
environmentalists,” says Ms. Brooks. “So
I just have to continue to be as nasty as l
can—so the government is scared of
me."

New threat to birds in Italy

Regional Bill No. 328 of the Auton-
omous Region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia

1986, permits 880,000 small birds to be

Legal Foundation Troubles

an Burt, president of the the

Capital Legal Foundation, has

turned in his resignation amid
indications that support for such con-
servative legal foundations is flag-
ging.

“There’s no question about that,”
said Mr. Burt, who achieved a high
public profile as the chief lawyer for
Gen. William C. Westmoreland in his
libel suit against CBS. “What we have
seen in the past year, not just us, is
that the more reflective conservative
groups have had real funding prob-
lems."

Mr. Burt said declining revenue
from conservative corporate donors
resulted from a perception that their
work “has been done in the economy”
and that conservative emphasis was
now on emotional issues such as abor-
tion and foreign policy, notably in
Central America.

Mr. Burt, who has been president of
the nonprofit foundation for six years,
said the progress of deregulation in
the Reagan Administration was,
paradoxically, largely responsible for
the decline of support for organiza-
tions like his. “There is a lot less
regulation and a lot of what is left is
transferred to the states,” he said.

Despite his resignation, and despite
cutbacks in the foundation’s legal
staff and a move to smaller quarters,
Mr. Burt said, “We’re not out of busi-
ness.”

The Capital Legal Foundation’s
economic problems are shared by
similar free—market-oriented legal
groups that sprung up in the 1970’s.
Such problems have been felt, for in-
stance, at the Colorado-based Moun-
tain States Legal . Foundation,

Rifle Association Power Struggle -
Pits Board Against Conservatives-

 

Nearly a decade after the National

Rifle Association went through a'

sweeping leadership upheaval, a new
power struggle is under way in the na-
tion’s foremost gun lobby.

The dispute pits the 75-member
board of directors against a conserva-
tive dissident faction of members who
term the board too conciliatory toward
politicians in the organization’s fight to
defend what it considers a constitu-
tional right. The struggle, largely be-
hind the scenes, will help determine the
leadership of the organization and the
role of its nearly three million mem-
ber in making policy

The dispute has been marked by an-
gry charges that the board acted ille—
gally in removing a paid officer and
has‘ abused its powers, and counter-
charges that the dissidents have virtu-
ally, subverted the organization.

The dissidents seek to defend the
members’ ability to fill the organiza-
tion’s highest staff position and want a
stritt adherence by the board of direc-
tors to the bylaws. The bylaws now pro-
vide that the highest staff position, the
executive vice presidency, is filled by
membership election, along the board
seats, one third of them at each elec-
tion‘.

.‘Talking About Management’

R‘udolph F. Rose, an insurgent mem-
berfrom Virginia who is running for a
seat on the board, said: ”We’re not
talking about any kind of gun issue
here, we’re talking aboi1t the manage-
ment of the organization. Does the
board have the right to violate its own
bylaws with impunity? I don’t think
so."

James Reinke, president of the or
ganization, denied that the the board
had" ever exceeded its legal authority.
“Our legal counsel has said that the
complaints are without merit,” Mr
Reinke said. '

Earlier this month, the chapter for ,

Maryland and the District of Columbia,
as well as individual members, filed a
complaint against the board with the
Attorney General of New York, the
state where the association is incorpo—
rated.

The complaint says that the execu-
tive vice president was removed and
replaced by the board in defiance of
bylaws. The complaint also says that
the organization’s official journal pre-
sented only the arguments of the board
on proposals to change the bylaws and
that members could not get other infor-
mation they sought,

Convention to Be Held in April

Some members and state associa-
tions have also accused the board of
using membership publications for
politicking on the bylaws vote and the
elections, which will take place in April
at the membership convention in Reno.
They also say that computer system
used to count ballots may be pro-
grammed with predetermined results.
Mail ballots for those not attending the
Reno meeting start arriving in in the
current issue of the organization’s
journal this weekend.

~M'

Neal Knox, considered the leader of
the dissidents, was mawd by the board
in 1982 from his position as the organi-
zation’s chief lobbyist. Members and
former members of the board and staff
have said Mr. Knox alienated key
members of Congress with a confron-
tational style.

Mr Knox, who is campaigning for
election as executive vice president,
and the dissidents want the bvlaws

changed to allow members to remove
the executive vice president, as well as
elect him, to give all members the op-
portunity to put their views into the as-
sociation’ s publications and to affirm
that the members have a duty to sup-
port keeping and bearing arms as a
constitutional right. In September, the
.board overwhelmingly disapproved
this package of changes.

Knox at the next annual meeting, the
organization would become more hard-
line, many staff members and observ—
ers Say.

Board Wants the PowerBack

The board, led by Mr. Reinke, has
recommended its own amendment to
the bylaws, giving the board the power
to select and dismiss the executive vice
president.

Incumbent officials said the board
was not concerned about the dissi~
dents’ challenge because their number

was small. Board members have, how—'

ever, begun raising money to cam—
paign against the dissidents and their
proposed changes.

Last month, the Gun Rights Commit-
. tee an organization of present and for-
;mer board members of the organiza-
tion, sent selected members an appeal
for money The letter said $50, 000 was
needed to stop “Knox and his ‘take
over the N. R. A’ crowd,” and ‘win this
1987 battle over the bylaws and the fu-
ture of our beloved N. R. A. ”

The split first developed at the as-
sociation’s 1977 annual meeting in Cin-
cinnati. in a shake-up, members ousted
most of their top elected and paid offi-
icials’ and selected Harlon Carter, a for—
!mer president, as executive vice presi-
dent. It was at this time that the mem-
bers changed the bylaws to allow mem-
bership election of the executive vice
president.

The strategy for that revolt was prin-
cipally developed by Mr. Knox, then
editor of Rifle magazine and Hand-
loader magazine, which are independ-
ent of the organization.

Split Got Worse in 1982

The board’s ouster‘of Mr. Knox as
lobbyist in 1982 worsened the split, ac-
cording to N.R.A. staff members who
spoke on the condition that they not be
named.

The recent upsurge began last spring
when G. Ray Arnett, then executive

vice president, was stripped of power

and barred from national headquar-

ters in Washington The board replaced *

Mr. Arnett with .i. Warren Cassidy,
who had been chief lobbyist.

Louisiana Drivers Approach
Snakes With Tread

HAMMOND, La. (JD—A snake is
a zone: e minute a Louisianal
driver it trying to slitherl
across a hishway, says a biology
professor who studied‘ “intentional ‘
kill behavibr” using a rubber Snake
and a fake turtle. ‘

David Shepherd and his students
at Southeastern Louisiana Univer-

. sity observed 22 .000 moments in-
‘ volving motorists and the imitation

reptiles over three years In a paper
prepared for delivery today to the
Louisiana Academy of Science,
Shepherd documents his findings.
A policeman swerved off the
road to run over the rubber snake,
stopped, backed up. ran over the
snake again, got out of his car and
drew his revolver before Shepherd

stepped out to tell him it was a fake.
Another man ran over the snake,

backed up until his rear tire was
atop the snake' 3 head, then peeled
rubber down the highway.

There were 11 such “multiple
kill" incidents, Shepherd said, and
several cases in which drivers
risked Wrecks to get the snake.

However, he said, a turtle gets a

sporting chance.

About three times as many mo-
torists will go out of their way to
kill a snake as will swerve to run
over a turtle, Shepherd said And
there were no cases of “multiple
kills" involving the turtle, he said.

There were also instances in
which motorists stopped to help the
turtle cross the road. he said. A
woman near Madisonville tried to
flag a truck away from the turtle,
and a man near Hammond moved it
to safety at the side of the road 3.

The dissidents say the board had no
power to remove Mr. Arnett nor to re-

place him with Mr. Cassidy, absent a.
vote of the membership.

Mr. Knox and other dissidents said,

the board’s attempt to change the
bylaws to give the board the power to
remove the executive vice president
was an effort to undo the changes made
in Cincinnati. .
John D. Aquilino, former director of
education for. the organization and now
Ieditor of The Insider Gun News, which
151 not connected with the organization,
said: “What the board is trying to do is
reverse a 10-year policy where the
whole leadership of the N.R.A. had
been assumed by the membership.
“The board wants very much to have
control of the selection of the executive
lvice president, because they’ re afraid
that Neal Knox will try and win the
position in a membership election.”

FEBRUARY 1987

 

Mother Nature ’3
Ar my ,

Guerrilla warfare comes to

the American forest

t is a splendid afternoon fora felony.

Mike Roselle drains his beer, crum-

ples the can in one hand, and tosses

it, without looking, into the back of

his battered Volkswagen. Inside his

dusty backpack are fifty pounds
of six-inch—long nails, a five-pound short-
handled Sledgehammer, and a can of white
spray paint. He shoulders the pack, plants
an unopened beer in the snow, and sets off
for the Cathedral Forest, one of the last
large stands of virgin forest on the North
American continent.

The brisk scents of cedar and sugar pine
spice the clear, cold air. Thick layers of hu-
mus, built up over centuries, sprout bright
green patches of moss that hang like drapes
from the branches overhead. Roselle calls
this forest “old growth,” a term that de-
scribes not just the trees, which are among
the oldest and biggest on the planet, but also
the complex web of life this incredibly fe-
cund forest supports.

Old growth constitutes an almost inﬁni-
tesimal percentage of the forested lands in
the United States, and there is no commer-
cial demand for the timber, but the U. S.
Forest Service has made the harvesting of
the last of the old trees a priority. It is here
in Oregon, where the timber industry is
king, that the Service’s attitude is best un-
derstood: a forest that has never tasted
man’s sharp blades is an affront, an arrogant
challenge from the very earth itself.

And now the Forest Service has con-
tracted this stand to Willamette Industries,
one of the country’s largest wood-products

manufacturers. Roselle and others have
protested, blockaded, even gone to jail to
stop the logging. They wanted to take their
cause to the courts, but couldn’t afford to.
And when they tried to get the forest in—
cluded in wildemess legislation, they found
that the big-time conservationists had bar-
gained it away.

“Mainstream environmentalists are out
of touch, ” Roselle would say later. “They’ve
never seen this old growth. Most of them
are in DC, doing lunch in their designer
khakis and working out their retirement
bemiies. The problem is, the environmental
movement isn’t a calling anymore, it’s a
job. They think wilderness is some Disney-
land you check into after you shut down
your computer and lock up the condo.” ,

So Mike Roselle, “ecoteur,” has decided
it is time for glierrilla action. On this chilly
late-autumn day, he stops before a Douglas
ﬁr that reaches high overhead. He extracts
a nail from his pack. Then, with four strong,
sure blows, he drives it knee-high into the
trunk. He follows that with two dozen
more, laced up and around the tree in one-
inch intervals to form a double helix. He
moves on to another tree, and another. His
right hand starts to bleed from swinging the
hammer; he switches to his left. Toiling un—
til dark, he hits some one hundred trees in
an area of about twelve acres. On all he
paints a big white S. When he‘ is done, he lin-
gers over the waiting beer, ﬁres up the old
van, and rolls down out of the mountain.

The potentially felonious act Mike Ro—
selle has just committed is called tree spik-

ing. Chain saws and saw blades will shatter
when they hit the buried nails, thus forcing
Willamette to abandon the operation. ()r so
Roselle hopes. The spiking is a desperate
tactic in an escalating war between radical
environmentalists and a hit list that ranges
from Oregon’s primary industry to the Sier—
ra Club. The stakes are high: a few months
before Roselle’s action, the spiking of a
nearby forest elicited a $9,000 reward for
the arrest and conviction of the saboteurs.
And the arena is by no means limited to Ore-
gon, or to the old—growth issue: soon after
Roselle’s Oregon strike, his friend and com—
patriot Howie Wolke began serving six hard
months in an eight-by-eleven cell with one
window the size of a cinder block. For more
than a decade, ecoteurs have waged a small
war around Wyoming’s Yellowstone Na-
tional Park and Bridger-Teton National For-
est, ruining bulldozers by pouring sand and
water into the fuel and oil tanks, stealing
parts off helicopters, and destroying sensi-
tive seismographic equipment. Finally, de—
velopers caught one—Wolke—while he
was removing almost a mile and a half of sur-
vey stakes along a road Chevron wanted to
build into a proposed test—well site. The sur-
vey company’s owner, Dave Spurlock, who
estimated he’d lost about $50,000 as a re-
sult of Wolke’s “desurveying,” jumped out
of the forest wielding a hatchet and yelling,
“Somebody’s gonna die here!” Wolke, who
made his living as a ranch hand, bar bounc-
er, and backcountry guide, was no light-

weight: Spurlock took him into town at
hatchet point.

Roselle himself has been in jail a dozen
times for his activism. If he’s caught now,
he’ll do some hard time, but it’s something
he’s considered and come to terms with.
Sometime after he returns home—months,
in fact—Roselle will send a letter warning
the Forest Service about the spiking. He’ll
address it to the “Freddies”——a term some
say derives from Fred MacMurray, who
once played a galumphy Boy Scout leader in
a comball Disney epic. But to Roselle—and
Wolke and a growing number of increasing-
ly militant lovers of wilderness— ecotage is
no joke. With every bold action it under—
takes in defending the land with its bare
hands, this unpredictable left ﬂank of the
movement is dramatically redeﬁning the pa-
rameters of environmental activism.

Despite the anarchic aims of the
ecoteurs, theirs is a movement with lead-
ers, and Roselle and Wolke are two of them.
A third is Dave Foreman. In a book entitled
Ecodefense: A Field Guide to Monkey-
wrenching, Foreman issued the move-
ment’s call to arms: “It is time,” he wrote,
“to act heroically and admittedly illegally in
defense of the wild, to put a monkeywrench
into the gears of the machinery destroying
natural diversity.”

Simply put, E codefense is a how—to man-
ual for waging guerrilla warfare in the name
of Mother Nature. Its 185 pages offer thor-
ough instruction on spiking trees and
roads, dismantling billboards, disabling heli-
copters, burning bulldozers, destroying evi-
dence, and avoiding arrest. The book’s so-
phisticated detail makes it more than mere
entertainment: it is a serious, even frighten-
ing, technical manual. Foreman published
Ecodefense privately in mid-1985, and the
ﬁrst printing of ﬁve thousand copies quickly
sold out. He is now preparing a second.

“I believe monkeywrenching is an
extremely moral way of resisting the indus—
trialization of natural places,” says Fore-
man. “It’s one tool. Sometimes you lobby;
sometimes you write letters; sometimes
you file lawsuits. And sometimes you
monkeywrench. ”

That unabashedly radical stance has put
Foreman, Wolke, Roselle, and their grow-
ing army of followers in direct conﬂict not
just with government and big business but
with the enviromnental mainstream as well,
which roundly condemns them as heedless
corrupters of the fragile legitimacy the
movement has so painfully and slowly
gained over the last two decades. The
ecoteurs have loudly attacked the main-
stream for bureaucratizing itself into a state
of squishy somnambulism—and for losing a
precious opportunity. If the reign of James
Watt was hell on the environment, it was
honey to professional environmentalists—
those whom Foreman calls “more at home
in a fern bar than beside a campﬁre. ” Almost
every major environmental group experi-

enced huge growth during the Watt era. In
the ﬁnal ﬂowering of a process that began
with the movement’s string of precedent-
setting political victories in the 1970s, en-
vironmentalism became almost complete-
ly the province of professionals—“raging
moderates,” Foreman charges.

Between 1980 and 1986, for example,
the Sierra Club saw its membership more
than double, to nearly four hundred thou-
sand. Seeking a new executive director,
who would be paid close to $100,000
a year, outgoing executive director
Mike McCloskey' said he wanted “a person
who is strong in ﬁnance and budgets, who
has a track record in management, who
can offer entrepreneurial leadership, who
is alert to changes in the marketplace.” A
conservative Republican from Wash—
ington, I).C., was hired.

To Foreman and company, this shift is an
abdication of the very, roots of environmen—

 

“Sometimes you
lobby; sometimes
you write letters;
sometimes you file
lawsuits. And
sometimes you
monkeywrench. ”

 

talism, and they have attacked the environ—
mental mainstream jas rabidly as they have
the Forest Service, Chevron, and Willam—
ette Industries. In part, it is the zeal of the
newly converted: Wolke and Foreman ﬂirt-

ed with the mainstream before abandoning '

it. But if they did nOt set out to be ecoteurs,
each gave early indication of a contrary dis-
position. Foreman enlisted in the Marines
directly after graduating from the Universi-
ty of New Mexico, then spent thirty—one
days of his two boot-camp months in soli-
tary conﬁnement. “I just never could take
orders very well,” he says. In 1971, he got
involved in conservation work in New Mexi-
co; by 1978, he had a private ofﬁce in Wash-
ington, D.C., and the title of wilderness af-
fairs coordinator for the Wilderness
Society, at that time the nation’s sixth—larg—
est conservation group.

That year, Foreman was one of four peo-
ple who coordinated the conservation
movement’s lobbying efforts on the Forest
Service’s second Roadless Area Review
and Evaluation (RARE II). When the Forest
Service identiﬁed sixty-six million acres of

unroaded wilderness but recommended
only ﬁfteen million for protection, it was a
crushing defeat for the nation’s environ-
mental organizations, one that left Foreman
outraged at both the Forest Service and the
environmental movement itself. By 1979,
he had had enough. Then thirty-three, he
was going through “an early mid-life crisis,”
breaking up with his wife (also an environ-
mental lobbyist) and drinking a lot. So he
ran. He threw a sleeping bag in his old van
and headed back to New Mexico to think
things over. A little more than a year later,
he made a call to the Cowboy Bar in Jack-
son, Wyoming, where his friend Howie
Wolke worked as a bouncer.

Jackson also happened to be the main
stomping grounds of the six-foot-six, two-
hundred-and-forty-pound “walking left—
wing slogan,” Mike Roselle. One of seven
kids from a Louisville inner-city family, Ro-
selle had spent part of his youth in an or—
phanage, dropped out of high school, and
joined the Yippies. He wound up in Jackson,
often working oil rigs as a derrick hand,
working the biggest holes, making the big .
money—up to $1, 000 a week.

In 1975, Roselle had met Wolke, a disen-
chanted former forestry student turned
hard—core environmentalist. Wolke intro-
duced Roselle to the rugged, pure back-
country around Yellowstone National Park.
Roselle took to it immediately. But the land
was in trouble: the energy, tourist, and tim-
ber companies were blazing roads into the
wilderness at an alarming rate, cutting
trees, sinking wells, driving the grizzly bear
to extinction, and the two felt helpless.

Then Roselle read a novel called The
Monkey Wrench Gang, by Edward Abbey,
about a band of ecoguerrillas who use
sabotage to stop what they see as the en-
vironmental desecration of the south-
western desert. Soon after Roselle read
the book, billboards around Yellowstone
started falling down.

Wolke had met Dave Foreman through
Bart Koehler, Wyoming rep for the Wilder-
ness Society, and one of the country’s
shrewdest public-lands lobbyists. The di-
sastrous outcome of RARE II convinced all
three they’d been had. When Foreman
called the Cowboy Bar that day in the spring
of 1980 and announced he was fed up
with the environmental movement, Wolke
and Koehler grabbed their tents, their
sleeping bags, and their buddy Mike Roselle,
who by that time had organized something
called Construction Workers for Wilder-
ness. They beat it down to New Mexico
in Wolke’s old van, grabbed Foreman, and
headed south.

They hit the Mexican border running on
beer and tequila and an agenda: preserve
natural diversity by any means, legal or
not, and reclaim lost ground—close log-
ging roads, tear down dams, reintroduce
grizzlies and wolves and elk. They united as
a “disorganization,” with no ofﬁcial mem-
bers and no directors, and called them-

selves “Earth First! "

When they returned to the US, they
put up a plaque at New Mexico’s his-
toric Cooney Mining Camp honoring
an Apache Chieftain who had slaughtered
the camp’s inhabitants in the late 18005.
“Without his depredations,” Foreman in-
toned, “developers would have been here a
lot sooner. "

Then in March 1981, at the Colorado Riv-
er’s Glen Canyon Dam, they unfurled a
three-hundred-foot black polyethylene
“crack" down the dam’s face—to the de-
light of tourists and the chagrin of the county
sheriffs ofﬁce. And at an off—road desert
race in 1983, some one hundred motorcy-
clists drove down a blind ravine instead of
across the desert; it seemed someone had
rearranged the course markers.

Earth F irst’s bawdy road show was soon
drawing packed houses in the college towns
and rural meccas of the West. It preached a
message that was strong and often outra-
geous, and its central tenet—that man
should have no higher standing than bears
or wolves or rocks—struck a discordant
note among the essentially anthropocentric
environmental movement. Still, some of
their ideas made provocative common
sense—why not require all employees of
conservation groups to take two week. of
paid vacation every year in the wilderness?
And though their “Wilderness Preserve
System" called for a staggering 716 million
acres of wilderness, the proposal was well
researched and written with a detailed,
ﬁrsthand knowledge of the land.

“There was a certain gonzo, coyote ﬂa-
vor to it all," says Foreman. “We were all
drinking pretty heavily, having a good time.
I was a bachelor again; there were women
everywhere. Admittedly, we were being
fairly obnoxious, and there was a real feeling
of being the clown prince of the environ-
mental movement. We were comic relief.”

Still, no one was more surprised than the
founding fathers themselves when, in July
1982, some four hundred hard—core activ-
ists showed up for Earth First's third annual
Round River Rendezvous in Bridger-Te-
ton’s Little Granite Creek roadless area,
site of a proposed oil well. Nor when four
months later ﬁfty Earth Firsters showed up
to block a coal-mining operation in the Bisti
Badlands; nor that same month when a
New Mexico petroleum company that had
built an illegal road found it blockaded by
Earth Firsters and reSponded by bulldozing
their camp—~a confrontation covered by
CBS Evening News.

“Up until then we still saw ourselves as a
band of burned-out public-lands activists
driving around in a van and making a lot of
noise,” says Mike Roselle. “All of a sudden,
we were a nwvmzcnt.” By 1983, Earth
First! was running full bore. They organized
roving SWAAT (Save Wilderness At Any
Time) teams, burying themselves in front
of bulldozers, blockading logging roads, or-
ganizing demonstrations, occupying Forest

Service ofﬁces in Oregon, Texas, Washing-
ton, and Wyoming. They got into ﬁghts;
they went to jail. Earth First! “chapters”
had opened in most of the ﬁfty states; by
1984, revenues from publishing Earth
F irst.’, the group’s journal, and selling
EF! “trinkets and snake oil” allowed Fore-
man to devote all his time to running
the nonorganization—and Roselle to con-
tinue tooling around the West in the role of
what his business card described as OUT-
SIDE AGITATOR.

“People hear about Earth First! and tend
to lump us right into the same category of
ecoterrorism,” says Jay Hair, chief execu-
tive ofﬁcer of the National Wildlife Federa-
tion, whose 4.6 million members and $60-
million annual budget make it one of the
movement’s most powerful players. “In the
public eye, that greatly diminishes all the
good we’ve done. We’re a nation of laws.
Terrorism has no place in changing public
policy—I see no fundamental difference be-
tween destroying a river and destroying a
bulldozer.”

Most of the established environmental
community shares Hair’s opinion. Former
secretary of the Interior Cecil Andrus has
called Earth First! “totally unacceptable to
responsible conservationists in America.”
The Wilderness Society demanded to be re-
moved from the Earth First! mailing list; the
Sierra Club refuses even to discuss it.

For his part, Foreman maintains that
“monkeywrenching is sabotage, not terror-
ism, because it’s about property destruc-
tion. It’s saying, I’m operating as part of the
wilderness, defending myself.” However,
he doesn’t deny the potential for human inju-
ry: “It’s always a possibility. You spike a
road to give a ﬂat tire to an off-road vehicle
that shouldn’t be there in the ﬁrst place. So
maybe some fat guy has to walk a half mile
to ﬂag a ride and has a heart attack. That’s
an inherent risk.”

Earth Firsters themselves do not see
eye to eye on the subject of ecotage. As a
movement, they don’t ofﬁcially endorse the
practice—a policy that reﬂects both an
aversion to violence and a strategy for self-
preservation. “Any kind of violence in this
country will always be outgunned by the
government,” says Pulitzer Prize—winning
poet Gary Snyder, who is a key supporter of
Earth First! but has strong reservations
about ecotage. “Their tactic is to lure you
into an act of violence, then eliminate you
with overkill.”

Those who defend the practice will often
cite one of its many historical precedents. In
the late 19708, for example, Minnesota
farmers calling themselves Bolt Weevils
destroyed sixteen high-voltage towers to
protest a huge and dangerous power line
being strung across their land. At about the
same time, Oregon residents up in arms
over herbicide spraying that persisted de-
spite several temporary injunctions re-
sponded by slashing tires on spray vehicles

and occasionally ﬁring at helicopters; then
they incinerated a spray helicopter.

Yet these were acts of self-defense—
directly provoked. With the publication
of E codefense, F oreman—and his rabid
band of compatriots—~escalated ecotage to
an oﬂensive tactic. Consequently, the acts
took a quantum leap in both frequency and
technique.

In 1984, for example, one of Hawaii’s
largest landowners began converting a rare
trOpical rain forest to wood chips to be
burned to generate electric power. The
landowner didn’t bother to apply for a log-
ging permit, and after he was cited by local
authorities he continued chipping. Ecoteurs
stole onto the site and burned equipment
valued at more than $300, 000. The chip-
ping company went out of business.

A month earlier, saboteurs had driven
twelve thousand nails into twenty-one thou—
sand acres of old-growth forest in British

 

While an old tree

haired goofball camped

high was something
else altogether.

 

Columbia, a truly massive—and ultimately
successful—campaign. Saboteurs in Wash-
ington’s Wenatchee National Forest went a
step further by clipping the heads off spikes
so they couldn’t be removed.

And on and on: Dave Foreman says he
has evidence of at least one act of ecotage in
every state west of the Mississippi. It is
likely that many more occur but are never
made public: the Forest Service et al. are
loath to draw attention to their development
projects on public lands.

Foreman makes no apologies for the fre-
quency of the actions: compromise is de-
feat, he says, and wilderness, once de-
stroyed, can seldom be restored. This is
not a new idea; indeed, it was the impetus
for the work of such environmental pio-
neers as David Brower.

And in fact, if invoking the historical
thread of “no compromise” is one way the
ecoteurs explain themselves, the telling of
Brower’s story is another, and a convincing
one at that. In the late 19305, Brower, a shy
college dropout who pioneered mountain
climbing in the Yosemite Valley, marched

out of the Sierras and into the then-diminu-
tive ofﬁces of the Sierra Club. After thirty-
six years during which he transformed the
club from a sleepy gaggle of weekend hikers
into a bold, widely respected activist orga-
nization—the vanguard of the ﬂedgling en-
vironmental movement—he was ﬁred for
what was perceived to be fanaticism. So
he started Friends of the Earth, cut in his
pattern: bold, activist, uncompromising.
Once again, he established the vanguard.
And once again he was forced out—last
year—by a crew of young professionals on
Capitol Hill.

Since then Brower has conferred his un-
qualiﬁed blessing on Earth First!, with
which he often works. He praises its willing-
ness to shake up a movement that has be—
come painquy stodgy, and judges it by a
perspective that reaches to the last days of
John Muir. “They’re not terrorists,” he
says. “The real terrorists are the polluters,
the despoilers. ”

“Next summer we’re not going to tell
anybody where the Rendezvous is,” says
Dave Foreman as he looks out over the sea
of cars and trucks that have come to this lit-
tle valley in the mountains of Idaho. “Next
summer, people will just have to know.
We’re getting too damn big.”

It’s hard to judge just how large the tribe
is this year—more than ﬁve hundred, less
than a thousand—but all of them are com-
mitted. They’ve hauled their kids and dogs
and beer long miles through the hot dust of
the American West and on up into the
“Land of Famous Potatoes,” site of more
wilderness acreage—and more ruined
wilderness—than almost any state in the
lower forty-eight.

This is the seventh time the far-ﬂung,
peripatetic tribe has held its annual Round
River Rendezvous. They’ve been going
at it hard for a week now, drinking and
dancing and eating and talking round the
clock. And the thing they seem to talk
about most is monkeywrenching—mon—
keywrenching and jail.

Barbecued pork chops for twenty are siz-
zling away on the grill behind Foreman. Sit-
ting on a log nearby are Mike Jakubal (aka
“Doug Fir”); “Ghost Bird,” a University
of Texas environmental-studies major;
and “Mokai,” whose talents include a ﬁne
command of blues guitar. Ms. Bird had re-
cently been arrested for blockading a pro-
posed clear-cut in Sam Houston National
Forest; she’s a little worried about telling
her parents.

“Change your name,” advises the dark,
shadowy Mokai, who’s been arrested
several times. “I change my name after
every action.”

Jakubal is in far more serious trouble;
he’s doing felony time in Oregon for “har-
vesting” a billboard. He scored a minor vic-
tory by convincing the judge to let him out
this week and credit him with time
served—“I told him I had to attend an im-

At Yellowstone Park: a bit of burlesque to protest the squeezing of the grizzlies by developers

portant environmental conference”—but
he’s upset with himself overall: “We were
stupid. We’d just torn down the board, and
we walked right through a county fuel com—
pound carrying our saws. Sl‘ieriffs spotted
us and busted us right away. You’ve. got to
hide that stuff irrzrrmttotely ”

Foreman agrees. “You made the same
damn mistake llowie did,” he tells Jakubal.
“You got caught.”

Wolke, serving the last month of his sen-
tence in a jail hundreds of miles away, is on
the mind of everyone here. Each night, doz-
ens of woltlike “Howls for Howie” split the
cold forest air. His incarceration seems
only to have heightened the tribe’s sense of
purpose. George Crocker, who worked
with the Holt Weevils almost two decades
ago, says, “It’s time to escalate.”

()n the far side of the barbecue Mike
Roselle is improvising on his guitar—“I took
out my hummer/1 took out my spikes/I went
out in the/orest/A rza' I stayed there all night. ”

“Hey, Digger,” Roselle yells to Fore-
man, “how’s this: I pulled out some
stakes/The other day/I laid ’em on the
ground/And that’s where they stay.”

Foreman, seven years Roselle’s senior,
grins. The two are close—the day before,
Roselle was the best man at Foreman’s
wedding—but they don’t get together
much these days. Roselle is always on the
road, while Foreman directs things from his
home in Tucson. And though he still partici—
pates in acts of civil disobedience, Foreman
doesn’t monkeywrench anymore “because,
obviously, I’m a prime suspect. ”

But playing hardball has dangers apart
from fines and doing time. Even now, a few

miles downstream from the Rendezvous,
three dozen members of the l’osse Comita—
tus, a white vigilante gang, are oiling their
guns; earlier today, one of their kids had the
poor judgment to invade the Eanli First!
camp on a dirt bike. Foreman chased him off,
growling, “Use your feet, asshole!” Within
hours, county sheriffs and Forest Service
personnel had come storming up the canyon
to narrowly prevent a pitched battle.

In an ironic way, that’s a healthy sign: for
every member of the Posse Comitatus,
there seems to be an oil-rig worker, a roof-
er, a locksmith who can relate to Earth
F irst’s visceral approach to saving the plan-
et. If Earth First! has succeeded in any-
thing, it’s in gaining the attention of the
working class, which in general perceives
environmentalists as hopelessly elitist.

Roselle kills his beer in three long
swallows—~“Every bioregion has to main-
tain a high degree of decadence to perpetu—
ate its viability”——then points to a man in the
far distance. “There he is,” he says to Fore-
man. “The spook. ”

“Park Service undercover agent,”
Foreman explains; he says he’ll run his
photo in the next issue of Earth First!
Foreman assumes the movement was inﬁl—
trated long ago; sympathetic Forest Service
underlings have told him an inﬁltration pro—
gram is being designed at the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center.

“Great,” says Roselle. “If there’s a shit
list, I wanna be on it.” Then Roselle returns
to his guitar and bellows the refrain to his
newly forged blues: “They say it’s not
right/But that monkeywrenchmg/Sure seems
right to me. ”

Though ecotage is dramatic, emotionally
charged action, it is but one tactic in the ar-
senal Earth First! en'iploys—tactics that
have arisen from a seat—of—the—pants under—
standing of just how government agencies
and private industry collaborate in their dis-
position of public lands.

()ne summer a couple of years ago, I was
waiting in a rambling, rundown wooden
house in Corvallis, Oregon, when Mike Ro-
selle finally barged in. lle’d rented the place
to be a home and office, and he found four
Earth Firsters hunched over a door-on-
sawhorses desk, typing letters, clipping
newspapers. There were hugs all around;
Roselle lit a cigarette, opened mail; one let—
ter had a live—dollar donation inside, another
held a <mt.>-liundre(l—dollar bill. “Reefer grow—
ers, ” he said. “They always send cash.”

Then he picked up the phone and called a
United Press lntemational photographer in
Eugene, just south of Corvallis.

“We’ve got an action set up. You know
the place. Tomorrow. ”

Across the room sat Brian Heath, a de—
vout Christian who had dedicated long
hours to saving the Cathedral Forest——the
forest Roselle had spiked six months earli-
er. Heath didn’t know that it was Roselle
who spiked the trees; no one did. Heath is
strongly opposed to ecotage and doesn’t
support Earth First’s tactics. But when it
appeared the forest would be leveled, other
local activists called Dave Foreman.

Foreman dispatched Roselle, who went
right to work. The spiking, for which Ro-
selle takes sole responsibility, kept Willam-
ette and the Forest Service tied up for
weeks with metal detectors and crowbars.
Meanwhile, demonstrations and blockades
resulted in more than one hundred arrests,
and the old-growth issue quickly jumped
into the public eye.

When local groups asked the Wilderness
Society to send someone from Washington,
I). C., to help with a lawsuit, a woman rep-
resentative showed up and wasted no time
in telling the assembled activists that a law-
suit would alienate friends in Congress.

There was a great mumbling in response,
and then Roselle, sprawled in a tiny folding
chair that looked as if it would collapse be-
neath him, spoke up. “That whole forest will
be clear—cut by 1987,” he said, “and you’ll
still be invoking the divinities from on high
and playing footsie over lunch on the Hill.
Man, we’ve gotta regroup, concentrate our
forces, and outﬂank those bastards.”

“You’re using the language of war, ” the
woman replied.

Seething, Roselle stomped out of the
meeting. Two days later, he loaded a sleep-
ing bag, down jacket, and two big coolers
into the van and joined a dozen people high
in the western Cascade mountain range. On
his way up, he stopped next to a sign on
which Smokey the Bear advised that ONLY
YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRES. He
slapped an EARTH FIRST! bumper sticker
over Smokey, a REDNECKS FOR WILDER-

Niass sticker below that, and, ﬁnally, a
sticker that read sunvicn'i‘ 'I‘l-llC noMI—
N.-\N’l‘ l’Al{.-\l)l(;lVl.

Up in the Cathedral Forest, aided by so—
phisticated mtiuntain-climbing gear, sinewy
young men and women had ascended halfa
dozen of the biggest trees and erected small
plywood platforms, all of them a good eighty
feet above ground level—~—too high, in other
words, for mechanical cherry pickers to
hoist law-enforcement personnel up to haul
the protesters out of the trees. They had
stocked the platforms with enough provi—
sions to last weeks, if necessary.

Their strategy was bold and simple: Wil-
lamette might kill a tree, but it certainly
wouldn’t kill a human being. As long as the
protesters were up there, Willamette
couldn’t cut. And while an old tree made
for pretty boring copy, some long-
haired goofball camped out five stories high
while the Forest Service ranted and raved
down below was something else altogether.

That’s when I saw Roselle in Corvallis.
He’d raced back to call the wire services,
the Oregon newspapers, local television.
He gave them directions to the Forest, and
told them a guide would be waiting.

Then he called the Forest Service.

“Yeah, uh, this is Fred MacMurray down
here at Willamette Industries. Bunch 0’
assholes up there messin’ around the Pyra-
mid cut. Fix ’em, will ya?”

Twenty-four hours later the story was all
over the Oregon media: FOREST SERVICE
MAY BE oks'rnovmu STATE’S OLDEST
TREES. Things shut down for the winter.
Then on Easter Monday, the Forest Ser—
vice brought in a phalanx of outside law—en—

lead the Soviet Union to break its eight-
rnonth testing moratorium. Roselle and
company believed their physical presence
there could stop the blast.

They quickly shook military ground secu-
rityo-f‘They didn’t expect us to drive a Win-
nebago and park it behind a whorehouse”——
and, movingonly at night, eluded helicopter
patrols during four days of brutal heat and
bitter evening cold. They inched painfully
toward ground zero, but when they were
just, ten miles away, armed commandos
ﬁnally swooped down with orders to shoot to
kill if need be. The invaders were. marched
out at gunpoint, then driven to security
headquarters.

In fact, Roselle and company had execut-
ed an elegant fake: even as they were ap-
prehended, a B team, alerted by radio sig—
nals delivered in code, had descended on
the site from another direction. The team,
which included Daniel Ellsberg, avoided
capture until well after H-hour, and the det—
onation was subsequently postponed for

. two days. Ofﬁcially, the Department of En-

forcement crews to watch the site; Willam—
ette brought in twice its usual logging crew
and went right for the biggest, oldest trees,
which, with its beefed-up crews, it managed
to fell in a day.

If a young activist named Madrone hadn’t
been on patrol in the area, the media might
not have known what was happening. But
because of Madrone, NBC carried the story
on its nightly national news, and local ofﬁcials
called Willamette and the Forest Service on
the carpet. The message was clear: no
longer could they cut with impunity. Old
growth was now an issue, the Cathedral
Forest squarely in the spotlight. The Forest
Service and Willamette had blown their col—
lective cool. And to the environmental guer-
rilla, that is exactly the point.

Meanwhile, Mike Roselle has moved on
to bigger game.

Based in large part on his work on
the old-growth issue, Roselle was hired by
Greenpeace, one of the country’s largest
environmental groups and one whose repu-
tation rests squarely on its direct-action
campaigns. Appropriately, Roselle was giv-
en the title of direct—action coordinator,
and he went right to work.

Shortly after Willamette felled the big
trees, Roselle helped lead a nine-person
unit into the Nevada desert, to the top-se-
cret, billion-dollar Nevada nuclear testing
site. Congressional sources had leaked
news to Greenpeace that despite the pleas
of congressmen and twenty-ﬁve Nobel
Prize—winning scientists, the Department
of Energy was about to conduct a test that
Reagan administration critics feared would

ergy blamed the postponement on prevail-
ing wind conditions, but meteorological
reports failed to back up their claim. Ap-
parently, the ecocommandos had scored
a major coup: no one had ever succeeded in
forcing postponement of a nuclear test on
US). soil. In the ensuing months, several
more teams invaded the site, and there was
at least one more postponement—due,
again, to “the wind.”

How far are these radicals willing to go?
Roselle’s arrest in Nevada certainly didn’t
slow him down much. Three months later,
he was in Yellowstone with some seventy
Earth F irsters, protesting housing that had
been built in prime grizzly—bear habitat.
Dave Foreman chained himself to the visi-
tor’s center; he, Roselle, and seventeen
others (some dressed in grizzly costumes)
were arrested.

The National Park Service sent a bus to
take the prisoners off to jail. The bus passed
a meadow, and paused for a rare sight: a
mama grizzly and two cubs out for a lazy
afternoon stroll. The driver pulled over;
everyone—guards, rangers, prisoners—
spent a few moments in contemplative si-
lence. “It was a sign,” says Foreman. “A
sign that we were doing the right thing. ”

It’s hard to believe the Earth F irsters
pose any real threat, either to the over-
whelming forces of government and indus—
try that hold de facto title to public lands, or
to the environmental movement, which is
now a sturdy, if plodding, multimillion-dollar
industry. Still, it will take a lot more than jail
to stop them. And while their victories are
small at best, they are Victories nonethe—
less. At worst, these new radicals are guilty
of dancing along the boundaries of inspired

lunacy, inciting the masses by invoking the

rabid poetry of untamed nature—the same "
crime, of course, for which the unconverte
once dismissed a wild-eyed radic nam '
John Muir. G 7

other down the steep river bank in front of the settlement and
dive off longboats to play in the river. Only the elderly and the
very young are at home today; all the able-bodied men and
women are at the farms, a short boat ride away. It is the
middle of.July and the land must be cleared and ready for
planting rice by August. High up on the slopes above Long
Bulan, and on the other side of the river, stretch vast areas of
tropical rainforest. The forests teem with animals and plants
of every description, a ﬂamboyant expression of the Earth’s
genetic riches and a source of fascination for every naturalist
that has visited Borneo since Charles Darwin’s contem-
porary, Alfred Russel Wallace.

All this is to change. In the process of “developing” the state
of. Sarawak, the Malaysian government plans to undo in the
rainforest what nature has taken centuries to achieve—by
building a dam. As the Bakun Hydroelectric Project gets
under way, and the massive dam ﬁlls up, 4000 million cubic
metres of water will submerge Maring Anyie’s settlement and
its farms, together with farms belonging to 14 other
settlements. Shifting cultivation, an ancient and integral part
of the indigenous people’s way of life, will vanish from the

area. Hundreds of square kilometres of virgin tropical rain-
forest, with its wealth of ﬂora and fauna, Will also go under.

This devastation is to be carried out in the name of
development. The dam, twice as high as the Aswan High
Dam in Egypt, will be the largest in Southeast Asia. It will
provide enough energy to transform an unspoilt landscape
into a region of heavy industrialisation. If the project goes
ahead, it will force about 4300 people to leave their homes
and way of life in Sarawak.

The government argues that the sacriﬁces that the indige-
nous people will have to make are an unfortunate but neces-
sary cost of a development scheme that will beneﬁt the whole
nation. Yet the development that the Bakun Hydroelectric
Project promises may mean no more than political kudos for
those instrumental in its execution, international prestige for
Malaysia, and personal gain for a few individuals with the
power to grant logging licences or the contacts to obtain
them. Politicians and industrialists seem to stand to gain
more from the project than the people of Sarawak.

The people at Long Bulan ﬁrst heard of the Bakun Hydro-
electric Project in 1979 when their constituency’s representa-
tive to the state assembly brought them the bad news. But it
was not until 1985 that a representative for the government
made the long and arduous trip to Long Bulan to speak to the
peop e.

or the Third World, large dams have meant

Dams also bring disease and wreak avoc
upon the environment. According to the
proponents of such schemes, the beneﬁts of
the dam to the nation outweigh the
disruption, but the technical an other
problems associated with large dams
weaken this argument. Edward Goldsmith
and Nicholas Hildyard, in their book The
Social and Environmental E ects of Large
Dams Volume 2 (Wadebri e Ecolog'eal
Centre, 1986), provide seve examples of
the kinds of problems that large dams
create. '

Hoover Dam. Salinity in the soils down-
stream of the Hoover Dam on the Colorado
River ﬁrst became apparent in the l950s.
In 1961, Mexico formally complained to
the US bemuse water in the part of the nver
that ran through Mexico was too salty to
use. At one pornt on the river, the average
level of salimty had risen from 250 parts per
million to 655 parts per million in 1969.
The US had to spend several hundred
million dollars on a desalination plant. The
salinity will probably rise to 780 parts per

 

in remedial measures.

Aswan High Dam. Experts now agree
that this dam, built to store the waters of
the Nile, has led to a steady deterioration in
the fertilit of Egypt’s $0115. The reason is
that the idile no longer deposits large
amounts of silt, traditionally used as ferti-
liser by Egyptian farmers. In addition, the
bed and banks of the Nile are becoming
eroded downstream of the dam; the coast-
line in-the Nile delta is retreatin ; the vast
amounts of 'cides and fe ° ' rs now
needed have n killing more ﬁsh; and the
rising water table has weakened the founda-
tions of many buildings, which threaten to
collapse. _

Volta River Project. This scheme, in
Ghana, in 1962. The main objective
of the V0 ta River Dam was to roduce
electricity for the manufacture o alumi-
nium. To this end, the project displaced
64 000 peo le. The Ghanaian government
found itselFunable to build all the ofﬁces,
recreational facilities, schools, hospitals
and so on, that it had promised. There were
not enough houses, cleared land, money or

leapt from an original estimate of $10
million to $34 milhon.

The people were originally spread out
in 740 small settlements. They were of
different ethnic cups with different
cultures, different anguages and different
lifestyles. Some were cocoa farmers others
were ﬁshermen. By 1966, the effects of
being lumped together in 52 new Villages
had taken their toll: there was Widespread
social disruption. Within ﬁve years, the
change had transformed the people from
independent farmers to a dispossessed rural
community that was entirely dependent on
the state or food, shelter and workogg
1970, only 25 000 of the original 64
people remained in the new Villages. .

Health also suffered. Rates of infection
with the waterborne parasrtic
schistosomiasis increased from under
5 per cent to 80 per cent by 1908. About
70000 people in the surrounding areas
beeame blind as a result of the disease

the scheme. Since 1979, an organisation called the SAMA
Consortium, itself acting on behalf of the German Agency for
Technical Assistance, has carried out nine feasibility studies

for the Malaysian government. So far the studies have cost ,
Malaysians M$37 million (roughly £9-5 mrllron) but the

government has not made the information public. Instead,
last March, the Malaysian Ministry of Energy, Tele-
communications and Posts published a selection of the
results in a glossy booklet. To date, this is the only informa-
tion about the Bakun scheme that the government. has
supplied to the Malaysian public. Even then, the onus IS on
individuals to apply to the ministry for the booklet. _

According to that booklet, the aim of the Bakun scheme rs
to provide cheap electricity for Malaysia’s growing industn-
alisation. Bakun will be the ﬁrst of four dams in the area—the
others will be on the nearby Murum River (900 megawatts);
at Baleh (950 megawatts) and at Pelagus (770 megawatts). If
all four dams come into existence, they will displace some
16 000 people and destroy an inestimable amount of ram—
forest and wildlife. .

The initial plan is to build a dam, 210 rnetres high, across
the Balui River, 37 kilometres upriver from the town of
Belaga in Sarawak. The dam will create a lake with a surface
area of 695 square kilometres, larger than the area of Singa-
pore. Because the terrain is hilly, the actual area ﬂooded Will
be far greater. According to the SAMA Consortrum’s general
report on the feasibility of the scheme, primary ramforest
covers 60 per cent of the area. .

The stored water, forced through eight turbines 1n the
dam’s powerhouse, will create 2400 megawatts of
electricity—almost as much electricity as the whole of Malay-
sia needed in 1985. The estimated cost, at 1985 prices and

without allowing for escalation and interest on the loan, is ‘
M$7815 million. The government predicts that the Bakun 1

Hydroelectric Project will last 50 years, and save M$l~1
billion per year in fuel costs. Yet large dams are notoriously
bad at fulﬁlling all they promise. They become clogged wrth
silt, and they are inefﬁcient, expensive and ecologically
destructive (Box 1). According to the booklet, however, the
Bakun Hydroelectric Project will have several beneﬁts. These
include:

0 Improving the quality of life of resettled people.

0 Avoiding the air pollution that thermal plants would other-
wise cause.

. Creating employment.

0 Providing a potential source of water for irrigation.

o Encouraging further management of the reservoir’s catch-
ment area—for example, by-setting up wildlife sanctuaries

and national parks, and by implementing programmes that .

will reduce soil erosion.

0 Promoting economic activities including long-term
exploitation of timber.

0 Developing ﬁshing industries in the reservoir.

0 Promoting industrialisation in Sarawak and Malaysia.

At ﬁrst glance, the list is impressive, even thou certain
aims, such as long-term exploitation of timber, are inherently
incompatible with others—reducing soil erosion. Some items
on the list are of very dubious beneﬁt. The reservoir will be a
perfect breeding place for malaria] mosquitoes, and bring
with it the threat of disease (Box 2).

' direct-current cables, across the ﬂoor of the South

Cables across the sea

The scale of the project alone is frightening. Sarawak itself
needed the capacity to generate only 180 megawatts of elec-
tricity in 1985. It will probably need 580 megawatts by 1990.
So what will happen to the surplus produced by the Bakun
Hydroelectric Project? The plan is to channel it about 650
kilometres to Peninsular Malaysia via two mgr-voltage

ina Sea.
Each cable will be able to carry 750 megawatts of electricity.
High-voltage transmission cables of this length are unprece-
dented. Their feasibility and safety remain matters for specu-
lation. Sabah (Malaysia’s other state on the island of Borneo)

. and West Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) will also receive

power from the Bakun Hydroelectric Project. There is even
talk of selling electricity to Singapore.

Gurmit Singh, chairman of the Environmental Protection
Society of Malaysia, and an electrical engineer by training,
estimates that 10 per cent of the output—equivalent to
Sarawak’s present annual consumption—will be lost by the
time the electricity reaches Peninsular Malaysia. Singh also
doubts whether the Malaysian national grid could cope with
the massive drop in power should the dam fail.

Then there is the question of who will use the electricity

once it gets to the peninsula. The peak demand for elec—
tricity for the whole of Malaysia in 1985 was 2410 megawatts.
The government predicts that this ﬁgure will reach 5430 mega-
watts by 1995. Yet there is little sign that local industries need
this sort of power. The dam will ﬂood 15 settlements along
the Balui River, none of which enjoys the beneﬁts of elec-
tricity. Nor does there seem to be much prospect of any. In the
government’s booklet on the Bakun Hydroelectric Project,
Malaysia’s energy minister, Leo Moggie, talks vaguely of how
the project will “boost industrial development”.

One potential consumer for the electricity produced by the
dam must be the American company Reynolds. In the late
19705, Reynolds investigated setting up an aluminium smelt-

.ing plant in Bintulu, northwest of the proposed dam. Alumi-

nium smelting devours huge quantities of electricity. It also
produces vast amounts of waste.

According to a parliamentary speech given in 1985 by Sim
Kwang Yong, MP for Bandar Kuching in Sarawak, Reynolds

intends to produce 100 000 tonnes of aluminium a year in

Bintulu. Kwang Yong expressed concern about the
company’s track record on environmental matters. Wastes
from Reynolds’s smelter on the Elbe River near Hamburg in
West Germany damaged so many orchards, nurseries and
gardens in nearby villages in the 19705 that magistrates forced
the company to reduce its production by a third. The possi-
bility of cheap electricity from the Bakun Hydroelectric
Project, the availability of cheap labour and the Malaysian
government’s history of complacency when it comes to pros-
ecuting polluters, must make relocation in Sarawak an attrac-
tive option for Reynolds.

According to the general report of the SAMA Consortium,
the dam will take 12-5 years to construct and could employ
up to 3390 people. The report notes that “the large numbers
of workers employed in the construction would create a high
demand for basic goods. Although local trade would beneﬁt,
the increasing demand for basic food items would lead to
rising prices in Belaga town.” Other people in the Belaga
district who will not have jobs connected with the dam would
therefore ﬁnd it increasingly difﬁcult to keep pace with the
cost of living. In addition, says the report, the construction
work would be “expected to have a negative effect on farming
activities and lead to disruption of social organisation”.

So it seems that the people of Sarawak will gain very little

in return for the loss of their forest and all that it provides.

The 4300 people living in the area to be ﬂooded have already
begun to feel the side effects of “development”. The people at
Long Bulan told us how.

With the help of an interpreter and the hospitality of our

hosts, we invited several of the villagers to meet us one
evening at our hosts’ longhouse. The villagers had just
returned from their farms which they were preparing for the
planting of their main crop and source of food—a poor-
yielding rice called hill paddy. The protein in their diet comes
from ﬁsh, wild boar and other game. One man told us that
srnce the logging companies arrived in 1983, the villagers
catch far fewer wild boar, because the disturbance has
frightened the animals away from the area. Rain washes soil
from logged areas into the river. The silt starves plankton of
light, reducing the quantity and quality of ﬁsh in the river.

The Kenyah people came to Sarawak from Kalimantan
(Indonesian Borneo) about 40 years ago. They are one of
about 10 ethnic groups that comprise the Oran Ulu people
who live in the interior of Sarawak. Each group as a distinct
language and tradition. Before missionanes and Christianity
reached Sarawak, the Orang Ulu were animists, believing in
a world in which every object, animate or inanimate,
possesses a soul. Now, all but one or two of the 500 or so
Kenyah people of Long Bulan are Christian. Only the intri-
cate tattoos on the arms and legs of the older men and women
hint at the old traditions.

There is no nostalgia for the old beliefs. “They held us
back,” Maring Anyie told us. “If a man should go hunting one

morning and a certain bird swooped across his path he would
have to go back home immediately,” she explained. Each
ritual would mean the loss of more livestock—perhaps
satisfying the spirits but doing little for hungry bellies.

Although the ancient religious rituals may have disap-
peared, many traditions unique to the people who live on the
Balui River still survive. Their lives revolve around the culti-
vation of rice and a few cash crops such as pepper, ginger,
cocoa and rubber. The villagers plant rice in August and
harvest it in March. They then leave the land fallow, some-
times for 20 years or more, and the community farms another
patch of jungle. In July, each household will clear and burn
about I to 4 hectares and the cycle begins again. This is the
way of life of the Orang Ulu. Understandably, they worry
about adjusting to something new.

The Kenyah, like the Kayan and Kajang, the other main
ethnic groups that live along the Balui River, have no illu-
sions about their present way of life. They are clear about the
type of development they want. The people at long Bulan
told us that they would have no objection if the government
wanted to build a road to connect them with a town. Aﬁer
being tossed about for eight hours from Belaga to Long Bulan
in a narrow boat, heaving sighs of relief as we passed safely
through the numerous rapids, we could understand the

 

MALAYSIA’S government boasts that

the Bakun Hydroelectric Project will
offer the country many beneﬁts, from ﬁsh-
eries, tourism, effective long-term
exploitation of timber and a potential
source of water for irrigation to national
parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and the
welcome industrialisation of Sarawak. Yet
the Sarawakians could get more than they
bargained for if the Bakun Hydroelectric
Project goes ahead.

Inevitably, large reservoirs drastically
change an area. Much wildlife drowns and
many habitats become ﬂooded. Animals
and plants suited to life in rivers often
cannot adapt to lakes. The ﬁrst to go are the
migratory ﬁsh, such as salmon, that swim
upriver to Spawn. The Balui River is fast
flowing in the Bakun region and well
oxygenated. The water level can ﬂuctuate
as much as 10 metres a day at some
locations, so that the river is rarely over-
loaded with organic material. At least 45
species of ﬁsh swim up and down it, accord-
ing to one survey.

The dam will inevitably change the
quality of the water. Vegetation lining the
reservoir quickly decomposes as a result of
the action of anaerobic organisms. The
SAMA Consortium, an organisation that
has made several studies for the Malaysian
government into the possible effects of the
dam, predicts in one of its early reports
that: “Even if the organic load to the
reservoir is reduced. . . the impoundment
will unavoidably decrease the oxygen level
in the water and will induce anaerobic
decomposition of organic matter with
production of bad-smelling hydro en
sulphide in the ﬁrst years after reservoir rll-
ing.” The stench produced by hydrogen
sulphide gas—which smells of rotten
eggs—puts paid to any plans for tourism, at
least for the ﬁrst few years.

The deepest layers of the reservoir would
be permanently deoxygenated. Because
anaerobic decomposition is less efﬁcient
than aerobic, the water downstream of the
dam will be much poorer in nutrients than

river would ﬁnd it difﬁcult to tolerate the
loss of nutrients and the increased acidity—-
caused by dissolved hydrogen sulphide.
The problem could be even worse if the
Sarawakians fail to clear the 700 or so
square kilometres of vegetation before the
dam begins to ﬁll up. The acidity of the
artiﬁcial lake could then be enough to
corrode the turbines of the power house.

The Malaysian government lists the
extension of logging as one beneﬁt of the
Bakun project. Yet extensive deforestation
of areas around big dams causes soil
erosion, so that silt slowly ﬁlls up the
reservoir. The silt becomes trapped behind
the dam, along with all the other detritus
which would normally be washed down-
river. (Erosion would pose a particular

roblem in Sarawak where rainfall. is
requent and heavy.) The estimated. life-
span of the Bakun dam is 50 years. Srltrng
could shorten its useful life to 30 years.

The government does not mention
the risk to the communities downrrver-
including the towns of Belaga, Kaprt and
Sibu—if the dam should fail.

The huge surface area of the Bakun reser~
voir brings with it the threat of an increase
in water-borne and other communicable
diseases. Infectious diseases such .as
typhoid, dysentery and infectious hepatitis
are likely to become more prevalent as the
quality of the water deteriorates. The inci-
dence of diseases such as malaria and schis-
tosomiasis has risen following the building
of almost every large dam in tropical

regions. Both diseases are transmitted to

humans by vectors that breed in water.
The Anopheles mosquito, Wthh breeds
in stagnant pools and swamps, spreads
malaria. The inevitable and rapid growth of
water weeds, especially water hyacmth
(Slavinia molesta ), not only impedes navr-
gaﬁon on lakes but provides a perfect
reeding place for mosqurtoes. In 1984,
there were only 1015 conﬁrmed cases of
malaria in Sarawak’s population. of nearly
one-and-a~half million, but the risks of the

According to the study by the SAMA
Consortium, schistosomiasis, an infection
caused by a parasitic ﬂatworm, is the only
serious new threat to the population m the
vicinity of the proposed Bakun reservorr.
Schistosomiasis is now becoming more
common throughout the world. Health
experts believe that large dams and 1m-
gation projects are largely responsrble. The
disease can be fatal. , .

So far, there have been no cases of 801118--
tosomiasis reported in humans in Sarawak.
But the water snail that carries the disease
lives in tributaries upriver of the proposed
site of the dam. The SAMA Consortrum’s
early feasibility report states that if SChlS-
tosomiasis was “accidentally introduced”,
it would have a very serious impact on the
human population. [3

attraction of a road. The
people sorely need hospitals
and better schools, too.

A few hundred metres
upriver from the Bakun
rapids is the 80-year-old
Kayan settlement of Uma
Bawang. Here, the people are
concerned about the kind of
compensation that they will
receive when the dam is
built. The Malaysian govern-
ment has promised full
compensation to the families
whose homes will be ﬂooded
by the dam‘s reservoir. It says
it will give each family 4 to 5
hectares of land, ready-
planted. and cash for each
rubber tree and pepper plant
lost. The deal sounds good
until the people ask for
details. At a gathering in the
longhousc of the pengghulu,
the government-appointed
representative of the people,
one of the men told us: “We -
want to know how much the
government will pay for each
crop but they won’t tell us.”

Before 1958. the indigenous people had customary rights to
any land that they cleared and farmed. After I958, people
could clear primary forest only after they had obtained a
permit, but the government seldom granted permits to indi—
genous people. Instead, permits would go to logging com—
panies. Now the people just clear the land they need, without
bothering to apply for permits. Some of the people at Uma
Bawang cultivate 2 to 3 hectares ofland. The promise of4 to
5 hectares is more than they “possess” at the moment but it
allows no room for growing families.

The people of U ma Bawang, like those of Long Bulan, have
no desire to move. Yet the closeness of the town—Belaga is
just a couple of hours downriver—seems to make them just
that much more familiar with the ways ofthe modern world
and. sadly, a lot more pessimistic about their chances of hold-
ing on to their way oflife. Their spokesman explained: “lfthe
government wants to build this dam, there is no way we can
stop them. All we can hope to do is to get the best compen-
sation we can.” But lack ofinformation and ignorance about
life in town may thwart even this pragmatic approach. The
same man told us that the government would respect the
wishes of the different ethnic groups to remain in physically
separated settlements. “We will be resettled in one area,” he
told us, “but not clustered in one place. Instead of the river,
a road will link the longhouses.” He had no way of knowing
how villages tend to merge along a road.

Some people, however, will gain from the Bakun scheme.
According to a study on logging in Sarawak carried out by the
Institute for Social Analysis, 3 nongovernmental group based
near Kuala Lumpur: “Again and again, it has been shown
that the Sarawak political elite’s control over awarding
logging licences gives them the means to maintain and tighten
their grip on state power—by alternately rewarding their
cronies and followers, and buying off their political rivals and
opponents. In short, the logging industry’s role within the
system of patronage politics in Sarawak is vital and cannot be
underestimated.”

In January 1985, there were 12 logging concession areas in
the Belaga district. The institute’s study found that most of
the licensees in the Belaga district are politicians of the same
party or members of their family. Most of these licensees have
no knowledge about the timber business but instead go into

alliances with logging com-
panies owned by Malaysian
Chinese. According to the
study, the four directors of
one licensed company called
Lembahan Mewah, for
example, earned M33288 000
between June I982 and June
I983 for doing nothing. The
authors of the study say:
“This arrangement is the
norm in Sarawak, and so far,
no one has been punished for
this apparent contravention
[of the terms of the logging
licence]. Perhaps the political
connections of the licensees
have something to do with
this?”

Most of the trees in
Sarawak’s primary rainforest
are dipterocarps, many of
which provide timber and
resins. There are also many
commercially valuable hard-
woods. Consequently, log—
ging has grown to be
Sarawak’s largest single
source of revenue. Sarawak’s
treasury receives between
MS I 3 and M$28 per cubic metre of logged wood. Only the
areas designated as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries
are, by law, beyond the grasp of logging companies. Sarawak’s
Seventh Division, where the sites for the four proposed dams
are located, contains 37 per cent of Sarawak’s 94 396 square
kilometres of forest. Only I l 463 square kilometres of forest
in the Seventh Division are protected.

Timber companies have already moved into the Bakun
area. A director of a small logging company told us of his
coup in gaining 25 000 hectares of primary rainforest directly
above the proposed site for the Bakun dam. The concession,
he says, is worth M3350 million: “Chicken feed—some conces-
sions are as big as halfa million acres.” We asked how diffi-
cult it was to get logging concessions. A smile ﬂickered across
his face as he said: “You don’t need to pull strings to get
concessions, you need to pull big ropes.”

The Malaysian government has agreed in principle to the
Bakun Hydroelectric Project. According to Ismail bin
Mustapha, head of the energy sector of the Ministry of
Energy, Telecommunications and Posts, the Cabinet wants to
see the results of some studies before ﬁnally approving the
project. These studies include research into envrronmental,
socioeconomic and technical aspects of the project.

Mustapha told us that the government has yet to arrange
loans for the project. Consultants for the World Bank w111
study the financial feasibility of the scheme on behalf of the
Malaysian government. The present economic recessmn 1n
the country makes Malaysia an unattractive borrower. But
the World Bank likes to fund large dams. According to a
report in The Ecologist in 1985, the bank has approved
several similar loans. It credited India with $127 million in
1982 for the Subernarekha Irrigation Project—which will
displace 64 000 people—and is helping to fund the Kalabagh
Irrigation Project in Pakistan. (More than 120000 people
may need to move as a result of these two projects.)

So the Malaysian government is unlikely to experience any
difficulty in borrowing money for the Bakun Hydroelectric
Project. Anyway, as Mustapha told us: “As far as the Minister
[for Energy] is concerned, he has made visits to the affected
longhouses and the people were all looking forward to the
development and better standards of living that the Bakun
project will bring them.” [3

Ape Exhibit Ready 0 Swing Into Action

3.. It’s a jungle out there.
At the St. Louis Zoo, that is.

Workers have just a few more spots '

“to paint and just a few more plants
“to plant before the Jungle of the
Apes exhibit swings into action this
week.

Visitors will get their first chance
«Saturday to walk into the exhibit
and see four gorillas, four chimpan-
ff-‘zees and three orangutans cavort-
ing in a seemingly natural environ-
ment — complete with tropical
7 plants and recordings of jungle
»_ sounds.

The best part of the exhibit, says
“j Zoo Director Charlie Hoessle, is

that the animals won’t be behind

' bars.

“Now you’ll be able to take a pic-
ture of an ape sitting on a log or on
a branch or a rock outcropping and
have it be a beautiful, attractive
picture, ” Hoessle said.

The apes will be behind plate
glass 11/2 inches thick. That’s thick
enough, Hoessle said, to hold back
even the most ambitious gorilla.

Jungle of the Apes, which cost $5
million and took 21/2 years to build,
replaces the old ape house at the
Zoo, which Hoessle said was the
200’s last barred exhibit.

The apes that lived in that house
were moved to other quarters when

construction began on the new ex- -

hibit. Some apes have been re-
turned, Hoessle said, but the goril-
las will be at the 200 for the first
time.

Hoessle said the apes should ap-
preciate their new home. “It’s one
of the most beautiful, natural, com-
fortable environments anywhere,”
he said.

The apes will be in the center of
the exhibit, where they’ll be able to
swing on realistic-looking trees and
sit on a concrete floor designed to
'look like jungle earth.

0n the visitors’ side of the exhib-
it, tropical plants will grow in soil.
0n the apes’ side, the trees will be
made out of reinforced concrete.

“They can’t have live plants in

with the animals,” Hoessle said.
“They’d eat them.”

Temperature and humidity are
controlled inside the exhibit to sim-
ulate the animals’ natural environ-

' ment.

The apes have been in quaran-
tine at the Zoo for several weeks
but haven’t been introduced tc

Visitor Fed Dogs, Likes “White Bandit9

By Virgil Tipton '
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

While searchers tried last week to
capture stray dogs roaming Forest
Park, at least one would-be good Sa-
‘maritan was leaving bags of dog food
for the animals.

The frequent park visitor, who re-
quested anonymity, said he was one
of several people who have been
leaving food for the stray dogs for a
couple of years. , ' _

But the visitor said he had reluc

'Itantly stopped last week, partly be-
'cause searchers asked people to stop
feeding the dogs.

“It’s a hard thing not to, but I just
think I should,” the visitor said.

Searchers have said that one of the
reasons for the dogs being in the park
is that people have left food for them.
,Several bags of dog food have been
found in the park’s experimental
meadow, a 14-acre area of dense fo-
liage west of the St. Louis Science
Center. ‘

“All they’re doing, very candidly, is
-‘e 5330,, these animals colonize thes

Anw—r or

isolated areas, and that’s not some-
thing we want to happen,” Health
Commissioner William B. Hope Jr.
said.
The visitor said he admired the
pack leader, nicknamed f‘the White
Bandit” by searchers.

And searchers say that the dog ~5— a

large white animal of German shep-
herd ancestry — was one of the three
that attacked and killed two African
antelopes — called blesbok - in the
St. Louis Zoo last week.

The visitor said he had seen the
White Bandit bringing food to other,
weaker dogs.

“He’s one hell of a dog,” the visitor,
said. “I’m sorry he got in trouble.”

. The visitor said he supported the
‘ searchers’ efforts only reluctantly. ‘

Before the search began, he said,
he would occasionally find a home
for stray dogs that he befriended. He
and his companions would feed the
dogs without any problems. .

“If it would have stayed like that, it-

, would have been OK,” the visitor
,' said. “But unfortunately, something
A Zoo official said on Wednesday
that a healthy, lZ-pound female calf
recently was born to one of three sur'

The calf, which was born Friday,

dogs. On Wednesday, a crew of about
20 St. Louis Health Department work-
ers and police officers searched the
park’s experimental meadow, said
Tom Astorino, deputy assistant health
commissioner. The searchers left
without catching any animals.

Animal rights movement is fought

 

By Sonja Hillgren
United Press International

 

WASHINGTON -— Hugh John-
son, a poultry expert with the
nation’s largest farm group, has
a new problem on his hands:
This week anonymous “farm
-- freedom fighters” took 24 hens
from a Delaware farm to protest
production practices.

They called their militant act

. J “the first direct farm animal 1i-

beration ever conducted in the
United States” and they prom-
ised more of the same.

Part of Johnson’s job has been
to counteract the animal rights
movement by explaining to the
public, including school chil-

dren, the benefits of production ‘

of poultry and animals in con-
finement rather than in the old-
fashioned barnyard. ‘
Johnson works 'with agricul-
tural organizations in the Farm
Animal Welfare Coalition,
which defends production of
' American poultry and livestock

‘Ag

in the Classroom’ program defends

confinement of poultry, other farm stoCk

that is anathema to the animal
rights movement.

He said, “We’re raising our an-
imals in a way that is the most ef-
ficient and the most humane.”
He said existing techniques
yield cheaper food.

The coalition developed a
handbook to explain their side
of the issue to Americans.

And Johnson, in an interview,
said one of the key ways to fight
the new militancy is a program
called “Ag in the Classroom.”

The program, a grassroots ef-
fort, is loosely coordinated in
Washington to teach children
about agriculture.

Johnson said the general pub-
lic is often a few generations re-
moved from farming and “much
of what is getting out is misin-
formation.”

In fact, many people in agri-
culture see “Ag in the Class-

room” as one of the best ways to
tell their story, which is what
former Agriculture Secretary

John Block had in mind when

he invited people to an initial
gathering in 1981 from which
the program emerged. _

Block feared lack of knowl-
edge about agriculture would
lead to uninformed citizens and
poor public policy.

More than 130 education and
agriculture representatives
from 42 states and Canada will
meet in Washington next week
to discuss their local programs.
{They often borrow ideas and
programs from each other.

Although not all states will be
represented next week, the pro-
gram now has a presence in ev-
ery state. Five Canadians attend-

ing the meeting are interested“

in starting a version in their
country. '

Problems facing American ag-
riculture have “heightened ev-
eryone’s awareness” of the ef-
fort, said Shirley Traxler, direc-
tor of “Ag in the Classroom.” ,

Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng said the effort “is reaching
thousands .of kids. They learn
the simple fact that agricultural
issues and events have been‘a
major influence in human hlS-
tory - and that this impact con-
tinues in today’s economy and
society.” 1

At the meeting, Washington
State will show off one of the ‘
most comprehensive and cre-
ative programs.

Financed by the Washington
State Beef Commission, a state

agricultural council produced
an instructional computer game
for fourth to sixth graders to

' 'learn about the state’s agricul-

ture. »

Conan the lobsterwill be buried at marine park in Texas

United Press International

GALVESTON, Texas - Conan,

" the celebrated 22-pound lobster

spared from a steam pot by a pub-

.lic outcry, will be buried at the

aquarium where he was given ref-
uge last month only to die of molt-
ing at the estimated age of 154.

The giant crustacean was found
dead in his tank at Sea-A-Rama ma-

. rine park Tuesday, said John Keri-

van, a spokesman for the park. The
apparent cause of’ death was the
strain of molting, a biological proc-‘

. ess lobsters go through every two to-

it

five years. . '
“There’s a good possibility that

his being pulled out of the ocean

and the stress and the transfer con-

tributed to the death,” Kerivan said. ‘

“The process really taxes their sys-
tem. The hormones get all out of
kilter.”

Conan’s body has been frozen,
Kerivan-said, and tentative plans
were being made to bury him at the
park.

“He’s not going to be eaten, and
he’s not going to be stuffed,” Keri-
van said. '

A public outcry saved Conan
last month from becoming a free
meal for the winners of a drawing
marking the grand Opening of a new
Red Lobster restaurant in suburban
Dallas. .

Restaurant officials said they
received nearly 100 phone ca11s0p-
posing the lobster’s death, and a
Houston radio station began a “Save
the Lobster” campaign.

As a result, Red Lobster offi-
cials decided to donate Conan to
Sea-A-Rama.

“I can’t believe it,” Bob Hilde-

5; I466

brandkassoclate manager at the

restaurant, said after learning of

Conan’s death. '

“We still have people come in
all the time asking where he is and
how he’s doing,” he said.

Marine life experts had estimat-

ed Conan’s age at 154, based on his
22-pound weight. Lobsters are be?
lieved to gain a pound every seven
years. .
Kerivan said he would .try to
find another giant lobster for dis-
play in the testament and name it
Conan II.

area for future nesting. Then they will be released at Reelfoot Lake. The “bald” look -— actually
white feathers around the head — comes at about 4 or 5 years of age. Three more eaglets will
arrive today from Laurel, Md., and also will go to Reelfoot, according to Bob Hatcher of the
Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency. Bald eagles are listed as endangered in 43 of the conti-

in Tennessee at Reelfoot Lake and Land Between the Lakes since 1980.

Bruin back

big draw

 

in Camden

It’s 'cleverer
than average bear

 

By Steve Gaither
Martin, Tenn., Bureau

 

CAMDEN, Tenn. — A vaga-
bond black bear that has eluded
searchers during a‘ trek across
the Mid-South yesterday attract-
ed a sizable audience during a
three-hour stroll through the
north edge of town here.

“He came out from between
some houses and just looked at
us,” said Camden Police Chief
William Terry, who said he
drove his squad car to within 12
to 15 feet of the bear. “He just
looked at us a while, walked
away and looked back. He was
walking around just like he
knew what he was doing.”

The bear, believed to be a 4-
year-old descendant of a group
of bears taken from Minnesota
to Arkansas 20 years ago as part
of a restoration program, appar-
ently gave Kentucky officials
the slip, moved back into Ten-
nessee and wandered into Cam-
den about 11:30 a.m. yesterday.

Wildlife officials said the bear,

: believed to be a male, weighs

about 300 pounds. Terry, how-
ever, says that estimate is a little
conservative.

“He looks like he weighs over
400 pounds to me,” Terry said.
“He’s beautiful; nice and fat, jet
black hair. He’s getting plenty to
eat. Ijust hope no one hurts him.
He’s just too pretty.”

Terry said every move the
bear made attracted large
crowds of people who wanted to
take pictures and get a look.

While the bear caused no prob-
lems, the proximity to so many
people prompted Tennessee
Wildlife Resources Agency offi-
cers to try to tranquilize the ani-

A' wandering. black

“I think the crowd really
pushed him hard today,” said
TWRA wildlife officer Keith
Jones. “They were cutting him
off in every direction. That’s the
only reason we wanted to at-
tempt that (tranquilizing).”

The shifty bear avoided two

,, shots from the tranquilizer gun,

and wildlife officers chased it
out of town to a wildlife manage-
ment aréa in the Camden bot-
toms, where two officers were
keeping an eye on it last night.

“As long as he’s out of town we
won’t be as concerned,” Jones
said.

Ged Petit, information officer
with the TWRA, said the bear
spent much of the past two days
in the Big Sandy River bottoms,
“a rough wetlands area that is

the closest thing to what he
wants to be in — snakes, mosqui-
toes and no people.”

The bear straggled too close to
the north edge of Camden, how-
ever, so police and Benton Coun- ;
ty sheriff’s deputies surrounded j
it while awaiting TWRA offi- !
cials. -

Petit said if the bear is tran-
quilized, it will probably be tak-
en to Arkansas, where officials
believe the bear’s travels began .
before it swam the Mississippi
River, appeared in Pontotoc '
County, Miss, and then moved i
north through Tennessee along ‘
the Tennessee River and Ken-
tucky Lake. ‘

Once the bear reached a busy 5
tourist spot near Aurora, Ky., it '
headed south again to more re- »
mote areas of Tennessee.

 




Dog SavesBoy's life as They're locked
Tiny Room Together ‘for. 2 Years,  

In an amazing act of love and devotion, a German shepherd 7 ’

saved the life of a little boy —-. generously sharing his food during . ‘

two harrowing years both were cruelly locked in a cramped room.

And even after police saved the pair fro

living hell, the brave dog refused to eat all his food,
still convinced the little boy, recovering in a hospi-

tal, needed it more than
he did. _

“He’s a dog in a million,”
said Yves Cabel, president of
the French Animal Protec-
tion Society, which has hon-
ored the dog,"named Sultan,
for his selfless behavior.

“If Sultan could talk we’d
all have a lesson in the
power of love and devotion
that we would never forget.”

The tragic story began in
1982, when 1-year-old Mi-
chael Albrecht was shut
away with the dog by his al-
coholic parents, who thought
the youngster was underfoot
too much, police say.

“The boy and the dog
spent 24 hours a day in the
9-foot by 9-foot room,” said
Richard Pilard, a Social
Services officer in the boy’s
hometown of Strasbourg,

 

 

Dy PATRICK WILKlNﬁ

France. “Perhaps once a
month they were taken out,
or put on the apartment bal-
cony. They slept together on
a broken cot.”

Michael and Sultan were
fed the same food the par-
ents ate, but it was usually
thrown into the room in one
bowl. With any other dog,
the cruel feeding method
could have resulted in Mi-
chael starving.

“Normally, a dog eats
everything put- in front of
him in several seconds,” said
Pilard. “But Sultan seemed
to love the boy, and allowed

 

Michael to have half Of the-

food.

“After all, a full-grown
German shepherd is, much
bigger than a baby boy.

There is no way Michael
could have stOpped the dog
from eating everything.”

Instead of a toilet, Michael
had only a baby’s potty,
which his mother emptied
every day or so. And the
cramped room was swept out
about once a week.

Finally, Michael’s two-year
nightmare ended when his
cries attracted attention.

“This was the sort of
neighborhood where peOple
let everyone live their own
lives -— but finally the boy’s
crying prompted someone to
telephone the police,” said
Pilard.

Michael’s parents were ar-

year suspended sentence.

THE DENVER POST - June 10, 1986

Animal therapist claims
90 percent success rate

By Stephen Singular
Denver Post Staff Writer -

Suppose your pet rabbit digs a
grave in the back yard and buries
its live offspring. Or your favorite
python loses his appetite and
allows himself to be chewed up by
his dinner - a hungry rat. What
would you do?

Most people would talk to their
. pets or scream at them. Others
would get them some therapy.

Dr. Jack Hunsberger of Animal
. Behavior Consultants in the

Heritage West Shopping Center in ,

_ Lakewood saved the bunnies and
got the python to dine on the

. rodent. One session on the shrink’s
carpet — there is no couch — and
the neurosis often disappears.
. “Any animal, any behavior
problem.” ' .

That is Hunsberger’s motto and,
, while he admits to some failures, '
he believes that almost any bad
habit can be analyzed and
corrected. He’s treated birds that

pluck out their own feathers, cats .

that soil and horses that chomp on
their stalls. For the past three
years, Hunsberger, Who has a
PhD. in psychology from Colorado
State University, has been
providing therapy for pet owners
as well as for their pets.

“A dog trainer or someone at an
obedience school is trying to train
a normal animal for a specific
function: sit, lie down, stay,” says
Hunsberger, 38, who is short and
bearded, with penetrating blue
eyes and huge hands. “I’m more
concerned with resolving
problems. I use basic -
psychological principles dealing
with learning and memory, instinct
, and socialization.” . ‘-
Le't’s Say you live next door to a
family with two dogs that bark all
f night and fight all day. One solution
' is to remove their vocal cords
through surgery. Another is to
remove them to the dog pound. Or
you could refer their owners to Dr.
Hunsberger. First, he interviews
the owners over the phone at
length, learning about their

behavior as well as their dogs.’ The
phone interview is free. '
Hunsberger then invites the '
entire family — along with’their
dogs — to his office. He observes
the way the animals and people ..
interact and diagnoses the trouble.

It’s frequently a question of
dominance. In the wild, dogs
naturally establish which one is
dominant, which submissive. They
go through rituals, rarely getting
into serious fights. In captivity,
their instincts are scrambled and
they can turn violent.

An animal’s environment can
make it crazy; so can its owners.

“I’ve seen hundreds of cases and
I’ve never seen a psychotic
animal,” says Hunsberger. “I have
seem some neurotic ones. I’ve
seen lots of psychotic people. Often
an animal’s problem is not just its
own.”

He says he doesn’t shrink the
owners while he’s working with
their pets. Then he smiles and adds
that knowing how to psychoanalyze.
people doesn’t hurt. '

A common problem, Hunsberger
believes, is that humans think they
understand animals when they

» don’t. And people often send out
mixed signals. When animals don’t
perceive their owners as authority
figures, they disobey.

A typical session at Dr.
Hunsberger’s office, which he
shares with veterinarian Deborah
Bohn, lasts an hour and costs
between $45 and $60. Duringthat
hour, he observes the normal
behavior of the animals (and
humans), conducts tests and
prescribes treatment. In the case ,
of two warring dogs, he usually

recommends that one be dominant.
Then he tells the family how to
show favoritism toward the chosen
dog through a series of techniques.
The underdog learns to cope.

Hunsberger teaches the family
to work with the pets on their own.
One session often solves the
problem .— if the people carry out
the therapy at home. The doctor

v

tiwill ansWer follow-up phone

questions for six months at no cost.
He claims a success rate of 90
percent, adding that you can teach
an old dog new tricks but a young
dog learns much faster.

1 In some cases he persuades the
critters with electronic devices or
drugs, such as tranquilizers or
hormones. But because drugs can
be addictive and cause the animal
to trade one bad habit for another,
Hunsberger turns to them only in
the final analysis. . ~

He also counsels people who are
grieving over the death of a pet.
He’s been called upon to testify in
court when animals cause legal
problems; recently, a judge or-
dered a vicious pit bull terrier to
begin sessions with Hunsberger.

The field of pet psychology has
existed a mere 10 years and has
about 25 professionals nationwide.
Hunsberger says that by far his
biggest obstacle is people who
make jokes about pet therapy.

“First of all, no one’s heard of
it,” he says. “If they have, they
don’t know what it is. If they do
know, they’re skeptical. Then we
"get people on the J ohnny Carson
TFShOW analyzing animals over the
ghene. That kind of thing doesn’t
.e e” -.

- A number of mental-health pro-
;fessionals have called Hunsber-

'ger’s field ridiculous. That doesn’t
bother him.

“Those remarks often come
from people who aren’t in tune
with animals,” he says. “If some-
one cares about them, he is pretty
receptive to what I have to say.”

So why wouldn’t the python eat
the rat? _ -

“The snake had been sleeping in
his owner’s house for three
months," says Hunsberger. “Hi-
bernating. When the young man

. put the rat in the cage, the python
was still partially asleep and not
ready to eat it. I told him to put
mice in there instead. That
worked After a couple of days, the
snake was wide awake and acting
normally.

Endangered species
may prove saviors
of men’s ‘Jungle’

AboUt two months ago, 100 inhabitants called
the place home. They claimed they were
Vietnam veterans, alcoholics and bums.

POMPANO BEACH (UPI) — A
gopher tortoise and a lizard may
stop bulldozers from clearing a
sandy patch of woods where a group
of homeless men have found refuge,
a zoning official said Thursday.

The reptiles are two of three en-
dangered species inside the “Jun-
gle,” a mile-long swath of sugar sand
and scrub oaks where drifters and
impoverished men live in camps.-

A proposal to clear the privately-
owned land north of Pompano
Beach, following outbursts by
nearby homeowners to drive the
Jungle dwellers away, was blocked
by news about theendangered spe-
cies. County officials are considering
their next step.

“We were going to clear the per-
imeter. Then, the environmentalists
got involved. We are at a standstill
and waiting for the green light,” said
George Wilder, of the Broward
County Zoning Department.

News coverage of the Jungle
began about two months ago when
an inhabitant killed himself by run-
ning into the path of an oncoming
train.

At that time, there were about
100 inhabitants. They claimed they
were struggling Vietnam veterans,
alcoholics, bums, minimum-wage la-
borers and drifters.

About 25 men now live in the
Jungle, one resident estimated this
week. They sleep in camps hidden in
thickets of palms and pines dotting
an area used as a junkyard and a
place for children to ride dirt bikes.

“It’s the only thing we got,” 'said
a 38-year-old laborer who called
himself Ziggy. “When you make $23
a day, you can’t spend $30 a night
for a motel.”

Some homeowners who live on
the fringes of the wooded area,
which is flanked on the west by
Dixie Highway, are not bothered by
the Jungle inhabitants.

“I didn’t know they were back
there (until) I saw it on the news,”
said John Siciliano, whose one-story
house sits beside the woods.

But Paul Garland, who owns a
automobile repair shop about 30
yards from one camp, said he wants
the men gone.

“There’s a lot of kids here, and/I
like them. I wouldn’t want my kids
playing in there,” he said, looking to.-
ward the trees.

Officials proposed first clearing
all of the woods, then only a perime-
ter — up to 120 feet in some spots.

. “‘The residents would then have
a buffer. They could see people
come and go without having some-
one come out and frighten the kids,”
Wilder said. ,

County environmental planner
Don Stone said the Jungle is an en-
dangered Florida habitat with three
threatened species: the gopher tor-
toise, the scrub lizard and a rare
plant. He said only regulated de-
struction of the scrub would insure
survival of the species.

“Clearing it could cause prob—
lems,” he said.

Stone recommended the site be
placed on the urban wilderness list, ,
which would regulate how it is de-
veloped.

Nancy Stegura, who lives across
a street from the eastern edge of the
Jungle with her children, said she
wants the camp dwellers out but
thinks clearing the land would be an
eyesore. She recommends a nature
park.

Roving I alligator
killed at food shop

The 10-foot reptile, apparently
hungry, turned up at a drive-
through store in Town ’H Country.

By DANIEL ALARCON
Tribune Staff Writer

I A lO—foot-long alligator showed up at a Town ’N'

Country drive-through food store where the one-eyed
reptile received a bullet instead of a snack Thursday
morning

Patsy English of Thonotosassa, employed by the
Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission to trap
“nuisance" alligators in Hillsborough County, pumped a
fatal rifle shot into the alligator’s head.

Her assistant Charles Baggett whacked it with an ax
to hasten its demise.

The incident at the Beverage Drive-Thru, 6001 Johns
Road, attracted about 30 spectators, including Eural
Ray, 56, of Tarpon Springs, who was struck by a car as
he crossed the street, according to the Florida Highway
Patrol and St Joseph's Hospital

Ray, hospitalized with head lacerations was re-
ported in good condition, a hospital representative said.

Clarence Grubbs, 17, 5928 George Rd, was charged
with careless driving, said Trooper Milton Brown. _

Jerry Cummings, drive-through manager, was open-
'ing for business at 7 am, when his first customer of the
day reported seeing the alligator outside the closed
entry door of the building.

“Sure,” Cummings responded incredulously, telling

Alligator

- From Page 1A

The animal was killed because it endangered people
and property, said English and game commission Maj.

Floyd Buckhalter.

Otherwise, it would have been slain at English’s

home, they said.

Alligators that lose their fear of people are too dan-
gerous, even for wildlife preserves or zoos, Buckhalter

'said.

Under her trapper contract, English skins the gator.
The meat is sold to restaurants. The hide is auctioned,
usually to tanners making shoes and handbags, with
English and the state sharing the proceeds.

Opening the door and seeing the alligator, Cummings
said to himself, “Oh s—t, he wasn’t lying.”

Cummings called the game commission, which dis-
patched English and requested help from the Hillsbor-
ough County Sheriff’s Office.

Some spectators grumbled when the gator was slain,
Cummings said.

“Why don’t they release them in a zoo or park?"
asked drive-through employee Deborah Holland.

 

The alligator, weighing about 225 pounds, appeared
to be 60 to 100 pounds undernourished, indicating it may
have been out looking for food, Buckhalter said.

There are lakes and ponds near the drive-through
where alligators live, Cummings said.

Near the alligator’ 5 left eye, Which was missing, part
of an arrow protruded.

Hunting or molesting alligators is a felony; feeding
them, which makes them more likely to approach and
harm people, is a misdemeanor, Buckhalter said.

English said she has trapped 35 alligators the first
half of this year, which is about average.

About 1,000 alligators live in Hillsborough County,
Buckhalter figured conservatively. Alligators are pro-
tected as animals of “special concern;” otherwise, they
might decrease to a point that they would land on the
“endangered species” list.

Say bye bye birdie to eight
brown pelicans who left Tampa
today for greater glory elsewhere.

They didn’t exactly fly the coop,
but the handicapped birds will act as
mascots for four Greek islands.

The four males and four females
took to the'air by plane this morning
— they can’t use their own wings to
fly — enroute to Tinos, Paros, Skia-
thos and Rhodes.

The one male bird will be paired
with another female pelican for a
more enjoyable stay on beaches far
away from their usual group at the
Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary.

The Seabird Sanctuary at Indian
Shores offered the pelicans as a gift
after the death of two of Greece’s
most famous pelicans — Peter, who
was known worldwide after a visit
with the Mykonos mayor to New
York 10 years ago, and Jason, who
was issued a special passport issued
to allow him to make two world

to new homes on Greek islands-

The Suncoast Seabird
Sanctuary sent the
pelicans to replace
two used by Greece
on good will tours.

 

promotional tours in 1967 and 1984.

The birds, all permanently dis-
abled, were selected from about 160
brown pelicans brought to'the Sea-
bird Sanctuary for recuperation
after being hit by a car or being
snagged by fish hooks.

“They’ve been here a long time,
shown interest in each other and
they have a good weight on them,”
said Dianne King, rehabilitation su-

' pervisor at the sanctuary.

A day before their scheduled
ﬂight, the six- and seven-pound mas-
cots were separated from their fel-
low pelicans.

“It’s important to isolate them

temporarily to be able to calm them
down overnight and for the other
birds to calm down,” King said.
Standing in a circle, they thrust
their bodies outward and threw their
bills downward. “They’re nervous
and they know something is going
on.” ,
She said she’s sure, though, the
pelicans will do well on the islands.

' “It’ll be OK once they get home and

settled. They’ll definitely be able to
climatize.” .

For King, the departure isn’t just
bye bye birdies, it’s bye bye babies.
“They’re kinda like kids,” she said.
“Only it’s like having 500 of them.”

Every day she helped nurse the
pelicans back to health. “I’m always

. through the place. I’m always check-

ing on everybody.” '
It’s hard letting go, she admitted.
“There is one guy I pulled out

' today _—- I said ‘Boy, I really want to

keep this guy. But they are going to a
good place and they still have each
other. I”m sure they’ll be comfort-
able in their new home.”

CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER —. June 8, 1986

Parma resident '1
refuses to duck .-:
fowl controversy

By CATHERINE GABE
STAFF WRITER

I t appears that Parma officials are

 

making a flap over a retired resi-
dent’s pastime of feeding the
ducks on his own property. -

Joseph Amos, 68, is charged with
creating a possible health hazard
because the cracked corn he uses as
feed may be attracting pigeons and
rodents. He is to appear in Parma
Municipal Court on June 17 at 9:30
am. and faces a possible fine of $500
and imprisonment of not more than 60
days. . ‘ .

Parma Animal Warden Susan
dParusa issued Amos the ticket Mon-
» ay. ‘ ,

Parusa went to Amos’ house after a
series of complaints from his neigh-
bors. Councilman Michael Ries for-
warded the complaints to Parma
Mayor John Petruska, who, in turn,
forwarded them to Parusa.

Parusa wrote in her report that she,
went to Amos’ home at 10 am. and
found “food on the ground, six or
seven pigeons, one duck and a few
birds.” When she returned that after-
noon, she found the food still on the
ground and issued the ticket.

Amos lives on Twin Lakes Dr., a
tree-lined neighborhood nestled just
off busy Snow and Pearl Rds. Across
the street is the northernmost of the
Twin Lakes, where about 30 ducks
paddle away the summer months.

When hunger hits, they cross some
yards adjacent to the lake and waddle
across the street to the Amos home.

Like the children’s book title, the
. scene is often that of making way for
. ducklings as the mother duck and her
brood of a dozen ducklings cross the

2' street. Officials have posted water-

fowl signs warning motorists that
they may have to st0p suddenly.

For nearly 30 years, Amos has been
buying bags of cracked corn and
sprinkling what he calls “itty bitty
piles of corn” onto his sidewalk and

 

driveway to feed the ducks. .
The ticket has upset both Amos and

his wife, Edith, who are definite ani-
mal lovers. They own a shaggy dog, .

_ named Gypsy because she just sud-
denly showed up on their doorstep a
few years ago. “She just took us over,”
said Amos, chuckling. . ,_

 

‘1 say I came to live in a
city and now I live in a,
zoo. . . . When we had
a few ducks, that was 7
normal, but now the
whole world is full of “
ducks. ’

_ — Elizabeth Tischler

The ducks, too, “have taken over

- their hearts.

“She enjoys the ducks,” Amos said
of his wife. “We don’t do nothing else
but stay home and enjoy it.” J ,

Amos, who was in the hospital for
10 weeks recently, bought his wife a

10-pound bag of feed to give the ducks,

while he was gone.

His wife said, “We take a sc00p and.

take out some corn, and you should
see it when a mama duck comes with
her 12 ducklings across the street.
They stop the traffic and, oh, they are
so cute! The kids have a ball. We have
friends who come over here just to see
the ducks. I just can’t see what the
ducks are doing wrong.”

But Elizabeth Tischler, their neigh:
bor across the street, can. '

“With the ducks and geese, every-
body is-having a heck of a time,” she
said. “I say I came to live in a city

. and now I live in a zoo. . .. When we

had a few ducks, that was normal, but
now the whole world is full of ducks.”
Tischler has been complaining for
years to Ries, the city prosecutors and
just about anyone else who would lis-

 

ten. She has had several meetings with
Amos at the prosecutor’s office to try
to resolve the problem.

Ries said he had hoped such “intimi-
dation or scare tactics” would encour-
age Amos to halt the feeding.

Tischler said, “I am not a trouble-
maker. All I want is peace and quiet
and to be left alone.”

She said the ducks ruined her flow-
ers and lawn and had even been seen
on her roof. “My neighbors call me
and say, ‘Lizabeth, don’t you know the
ducks are sitting on your roof?’ ”

She said the ducks quack too much.

“It bothers me when I have them
always on my property. I run from
back to front of my pr0perty to chase
them away. And my flowers,” she
said, moaning. “In another couple of
years, I will have to move out to leave
our ducks moving in here.”

The waterfowl issue in this neigh-
borhood has begun pitting neighbor
against neighbor — pro-duck and anti-
duck.

“The larger the number, the more
dr0ppings you get,” said John Polder,
president of the Twin Lakes Improve-
ment Association for the northern-
most lake. “Secondly, they get into the
flowers and they eat the grass. They
plotch around when it rains and they
make a big mudhole. They nest all
over the neighborhood, as far as two
blocks away.” '

At an association meeting several
weeks ago, a vote was proposed to ban

all feeding of the federally protected

.' game birds. Polder said feeding the

ducks was unnecessary in the summer
and only assured they would stay and
multiply.

Instead of a total ban on feeding,
Polder said the association agreed
that feeders should cut back on the

\ amount they give to the birds.

The threat of tickets, court appear-
ances and neighborhood tiffs hasn’t
stepped Larry White from feeding the
ducks. White, who in the past three
years has had severe medical prob-
lems, said his only joy in life was
feeding the ducks pieces of white
bread.

He has done so for a decade. He has

names for some of the ducks and
; knows the “old-timers” from the
i yOung ones.

He calls the neighbors who are

‘ against duck feeding, “crabs.”

“If human beings could be like

. ducks, this world would be a hell of a

lot better,” he said. “See that seagull
over there? They all get along. If peo-
ple got along that well, this would be a
very good world.” '

As for Amos, he said he planned to
plead not guilty and had begun luring
the ducks into the garage, shutting the
door while he feeds them and then
letting them out so neighbors won’t
complain. '

His wife shook her-head.

“The ducks are just a friend,” she
said. “I mean, they are a true friend.
They are not ‘putting on.’ They are
company.” .

A 12-pound'puppy run over by a van

Thursday afternoon was “awake and do-
ing good” yesterday after three hours of
surgery. ‘

“I’ll be able to tell a lot more in a few
days,” Said Dr. James R. Pearce, the vet-
erinarian who performed the operation.

The dog had a broken leg, multiple
pelvic fractures and other injuries in an
incident described in the Appeal section
of The Commercial Appeal yesterday.

Lynn Washington, who rescued the
mixed-breed puppy from the street,
reacted with delight to the news that the
dog is still alive -— “Oh, wonderful!”

Darrelle Miller, a nurse who drove the
injured animal to a veterinary clinic
Thursday afternoon, said she had wait-
ed to report the dog’s condition until
she had something definite to pass
along.

Jim Johnson, a friend of Ms. Miller,
said she devoted much of the last few

‘days arranging for the puppy’s care.

“She spent all day Saturday running X-
rays around to people,” he said. “And
she is picking up the tab for this and
then will try to find the dog a home.
That’s the kind of person she is.”

Ms. Miller, employed at the Regional
Medical 'Center, had declined to accept
one veterinarian’s suggestion that the
dog be put to sleep. She said she subse-
quently was told that Dr. Pearce might
undertake the complex, costly surgery.

“I believe the dog will be weight-bear-
ing pretty quick,” Dr. Pearce said. “But
the pelvis is in pretty bad shape. We
were not able to stabilize it as well as
we’d like.”

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - June 1, 1986

Will Wests hardy mustangs go to the dogs?

v

By James Coates
Chicago Tribune

RAWLINS, Wyo.—For more
than four decades, Jim Genz, a
locomotive engineer for the Union
Paciﬁc Railroad, has spent much
of his free time in a truck roaming
the Red Desert northwest of here
amid playful herds of Wild-
mustangs.

Genz always knew where to ﬁnd
the herds, the descendants of the

horses of the earliest Spanish ex- ‘

plorers, the steeds that carried
such legendary trappers as Jim

Bridger and the US; Cavalry '

mounts that ran wild after es-
caping the slaughter at places hke
the Little Big Horn.

But these days, ,Ge'nz says the
hardy mustangs, who have sur—
vived everything from the range
wars between sheep growers and
cattlemen to the Great Depres-
sion, when not a few of their
number ended their days in “a
sheepherder’s ptotéd may end up 111

._...'4-_ 4134.5.

Dennis White, director of ani-
mal protection for the American
Humane Society and one of nine
persons named last week to the
Interior Department’s newly—cre-
ated Wild Horse and Burro Advi-
sory Board, agrees.

“I think we are perilously close
to the day when thousands of
mustangs and burros are shipped
off to the slaughterhouse,” White
warned.

The advisory panel was formed
to help Interior Secretary Donald
Hodel decide how to deal with the
quand created by the govem-
ment e ort to remove most of the
wild horses and burros from vast
tracts of govemment-owned land
in the West and a recent
slowdown in its adopt-a-horse/bur-

ro program.

Today, 10,000 of the once free-
rangrng animals are penned up in
corrals in Wyoming, Nevada,
Nebraska and Texas. And the gov-
ernment is feeding them at an an-
nual» cost of $7.3 million.

This summer the Bureau or
Land Management [BLM] plans
to round up yet another 12,000
mustangs and burros, and an—
ticipates that more than 3,000 of
tggse will wind up not being adop-
t .

That will boost the government’s
annual feed cost to nearly $10
million, and some lawmakers such
as Sen. James McLure [R., Idaho]
are arguing that legislation should
be passed to allow slaughterhouses
to buy mustangs and wild burros.

Under current law, Hodel could
declare an emergency and order
all the corraled animals destroyed.
“But you can just imagine the
public outrage that would bring”

'd Barbara Maxﬁeld, the secre-
tary’s spokesperson. ‘

Although White opposes turning
over the animals to
slaughterhouses, he said there is a
“strong chance” that a majority of
the advisory board will urge Con—
gress to allow the sales. ‘

The board also could urge that
the the captured animals be re-
turned to the range or that the

overnment ﬁnd land elsewhere

“ ' h are erilousl shi ed off to the slaughter house,” says a member of the
Ithrnk we p y lntngi)or Department’s Wild Horse and Burro Advrsory Board.

 




White. called the mustang crisis
a “classrc. example” of the pitfalls
when socrety tries to improve on
nature.

Although winters in the Red De-
sert are harsh and artic blasts
whipping over the badlands some-
times reach 60 m.p.h., the hardy
animals cluster on the dry lake
beds and survive by eating the
tops of the few sagebrush and
greasewood bushes tall enough to

poke through the crusted snow.

For the few glorious summer
months when the Wyoming air is
fresh as fine wine and the skies are
cobalt blue, the mustang stallions
move the mares and colts up the
ﬂanks of Continental Peak where
they feast on clear water gushing
from glacial springs and grass as
thick as a federal rule book. ‘

The herds were making the
same trek from lake bed to high
country in 1805 when Iewis and
Clark crossed the Continental
Divide on their way to Oregon.
The mustangs already had lived in
the Red Desert for centuries when
the Union Pacific track builders
raced through Rawlins' in 1868 in
the competition with the Central
Pacific to build the first transcon-
tinental railroad.

In 1971, Congress passed the
Wild Horse and Burro Act after
horse protection groups com-
plained that ranchers were using
cruel methods to round animals
up in order to free grazing lands
for their sheep and cattle. The
cause was boosted in the middle
19605 by Velma B. “Wild Horse
Annie” Johnston, who founded
the International Society for the
Protection of Mustangs and Bur-
ros in the mid—19605. * .

Movie legend Clark Gable’s last
film, “The Misfits,” had helped
make the animals a national issue
by dramatizing how the mustangs
were being hazed by cowboys 1n
airplanes and trucks in blood-
soaked roundups near Reno.

Horse wranglers brought by for-
mer Sen. Gale McGee [D., Wyo.]
from Rock Springs, Wyo., to
Washington told hair-raising sto—
ries of mustangs being gunned
down by the dozens and shipped
away in trucks while some still
were screaming.

But with cowboy roundups
outlawed, the herd numbers

soared until government officials.

started roundups of their own.

According to BLM statistics
there were 25,000 wild burros and
horses in the West in 1971, and
there are 50,000 today partly be-
cause the roundups stopped and
partly because of government ef-
forts to protect the herds from

droughts, disease and other ha-
zards. - .

The BLM has taken 79,000
animals off the range, said Max-
ﬁeld, and most of them were
taken care of by the adoption pro-
gram, WhICh allows people to take
up to four animals at a time.

In 1985, however, livestock in-
terests persuaded Congress to ap-
proprrate' a record $16.2 million
for the horse and burro program
that allowed the BLM to capture
19,959 animals instead of the

g 6,000 that had been targeted in

each: past year. .

T his year, although the budget
remains the same, the federal
wranglers plan to take only 12,000
animals, Maxﬁeld said, and spend
the rest of the funds on feed.

“You seem to get down to a
certain number that just are not
adoptable,” she said. “For exam-
ple, when you have a wild stallion
who is six or seven years old there
IS Just no way somebody is going
to break that horse or even get
near it”!

The M hopes to increase the

, numbe of horses and burros that
' are adopted by publicizing their
- availability, particularly in the
* Midwestern and Eastern states.

One event planned is a wiid
horse. and burro exposition July 4
in R10 Grande, Ohio. Previously
adopted mustangs and burros will
compete and spectators will be al-
lowed to adopt other animals on
the spot. '

0n Stray Dogs

The recent attack made by stray dogs:

against the blesbok at the Zoo was truly a
tragedy. The tragedy lies in the fact that not
only were two beautiful animals killed but
that dogs in the park are so hungry that they
are driven to such attacks.

I would certainly like to see such.inci-
dents prevented from
happening again, but
it’s a mistake to be-

letters , .
Ireve that catching a
from ' few dogs will solve the
problem. As long as
the thoughtless pet owners
1 continue to abandon
p801) e unwanted animals in
the park, there will be

a population of stray

 

 

 

i _ dogs. Zoo officials admit that dogs burrow-

ing under the perimeter fence have been a
frequent problem. Incidents such as the

» most recent one concerning the blesbok

have been taking place since the 19605.
Surely 20 years is ample time to look into
the problem.

What a sad statement on this city that
only when these animals are portrayed as a
threat to humans is there any interest
shown in them. Where were these agencies
last winter when the animals were without
food and shelter and rabies control’s reply

 

 

to repeated requests for aid was, “We’re
not coming out there anymore?”

I am concerned about these wild dogs
roaming around in Forest Park. Since I drive
through the park every morning and after-
noon on my way to and from work, I often
see wild dogs there.

The experimental meadow rs located be-
tween the Jewel Box and the Zoo. This mead-
ow has been growing wilder and thicker as,
the years pass. It is a perfect place for wild
animals to hide. I always thought of a mead-
ow as a pretty place, but this is an eyesore to
our city’s most famous park. The weeds are
high and overgrown.

For several mornings now I have seen the
city’s Health Department trucks looking
around in this area. I'hope they do find these
dogs because I know many people park

‘ along this meadow for the Muny Opera. I’d

hate to hear of one of these dogs attacking
someone there.
Kathleen Dennett
Mehlville .

It certainly is a terrible thing that those
wild dogs killed those animals in the Zoo.
Please don’t blame the dogs, though. Just
blame their owners.

I hope to live to see the day when there
will be a very heavy fine for people letting
their dogs run at large. It is also horrible that
so many innocent pets are destroyed every
year. We need legislation to allow only
breeders to raise animals, and the rest would
have to be spayed or neutered.

Why do so many innocent creatures have
to die needlessly?

Pets show
noruns

, no hisses,
no ‘errors’ ‘

By John Knott
Staff Reporter

 

 

After examination, conversation and
consternation (about possible rain),
judges of the Children’s Pet Parade chose
Caesar, a sleek black standard poodle, as
best of show yesterday. ‘

g The threatening sky — with ominous
clouds, lightning and an occasional drop of
rain -— kept 100 preregistered contestants
away. Still there were 200 pets, primarily
cats and dogs of all sizes, vying at Jefferson
Davis Park on Riverside Drive.

The rain, obedient as the animals, held
off until after Caesar was chosen.

The contestants were on their best be-
havior. There were no fights, growls or
hisses; only an occasional nervous bark.

Bill Calaway knew he couldn’t enter -—
he was not a child by any means -— but he
brought his pet blue and gold macaw to see
the show. “We call it Homer, but it could be
Homette,” he said as the macaw roamed his
upper torso. “Watch him, he can remove
your watch in no time.” ‘

Geneva Shoup and daughter Elizabeth

brought their mother cat and four kittens
— the mother to be entered and the kittens
to be given away. Mama didn’t win a prize,
but two of the kittens found new homes.

Runners-up were, well, unconventional.

Calico, which placed second in the cat di-

 

vision, was part Siamese, part
tabby and part , calico. She
weighed 16 pounds.

Katy, the winner, had seven
toes on her front paws and 51x on
the back. ~ .

Murdle the turtle, second in
the miscellaneous divisionnwas
in the contest because she bit on
a cricket when somebody was
fishing. - '

WHY DON’T WE PULL THE PLUG ON THE COHDOR AHD FERRET?

BY BIL GILBERT

 

he California condor and
the black-footed ferret are

renowned as the most en- . '
dangered mainland U.S.
bird“ and mammal. As of
this writing 26 condors
survive—22 in the Los
Angeles and San Diego zoos (plus an
eg that may have hatched by the
time you read this) and four free in the
mountains of Southern California.
As best as can be determined, six fer-
rets are left, all in a lab near Wheat-
land, Wyo. These animals were taken
from a colony—which in 1984 num-
bered at least 129 individuals—locat-
ed in a prairie dog town outside Mee-
teetse, Wyo. This colony was wiped
out the next year, probably as a conse-
quence of distemper, but three or four
animals may still survive. There may
also be small groups of ferrets in the
Great Plains and Basin country, but
their existence is even more doubtful.
. Some condors and ferrets have
been rubbed out, intentionally or ac-
cidentally, by people, but essentially
both species are on the brink of ex-
tinction because the natural systems
that made and maintained them were
greatly disrupted, and neither crea-
ture has been able to adjust quickly or

in the Pleistocene epoch. Because of changes in climate and to-
pography, the herds, and therefore the birds, began to dwindle. By
the nineteenth century the condor may have been a senile species,
but its decline was speeded up by human developments that fur-
ther altered its food supply and habitat.

Ferrets feed almost exclusively on prairie dogs and use their
extensive burrows for shelter and security. In this century mil-
lions, probably billions, of prairie dogs were killed by farmers and
ranchers because they dig up pastures and consume great
amounts of vegetation. Ferrets were the unintended victims of
the slaughter.

The extreme rarity of condors and ferrets has been widely pub-
licized. (The condor, in fact, has become a kind of Charles and Di
story, what with breathless bulletins about little buster’s hatching
at the San Diego Zoo, that adjunct of the Johnny Carson show.)

we think about and what we can and
cannot do in regard to the other 394 species of plants and animals
officially designated as endangered or threatened in the US.

So far as science and ethics are concerned, all the endangered
species would seem to be peers—that is, equally instructive and
deserving of what assistance we can give them. However, in prac-
tice about a dozen are treated as being much more equal. These
get more than half of the resources available for the recovery ef-
forts and probably even a greater share of our attention and sym-
pathy. This group includes the bald eagle, peregrine falcon,
whooping crane, masked bobwhite, Puerto Rican parrot, timber
wolf, grizzly (technically only a threatened species in the lower 48
states), and some species of sea turtle. But leading the way are the
condor and the ferret, now the most equal of the most equals.

Funds are scattered among so many public and private budgets
that exact ﬁgures are unobtainable, but it’s estimated that we
spent about $1.5 million last year on condor works and nearly
$750,000 for ferrets. This outlay is larger than that for all the en-
dangered plants, invertebrates, and reptiles put together. And

—
Another proposal: instead of playing out this Charade, put them in an endangered species 200

there’s now a proposal to spend up to $8.9 million to acquire the
Hudson Ranch north of Ventura, Calif. as a condor refuge.

Promotional considerations, more than scientiﬁc or ethical
ones, are chieﬂy responsible for the status of these most favored
species, all of which have several important traits in common.
When endangered species were ﬁrst listed in the mid-19605 the
plights of these select animals were known and fairly easy to ex-
plain—only 26 left, count ’em, 26. Because of their size, appear-
ance, habits, and history, all were sexy. This is a term used by wild-
life people to describe animals that make for appealing brochures,
magazine covers, and television specials, that are easy to sell to the
public, foundations, and appropriations committees. Since they
work so well, promotionally speaking, they’ve been heavily pro-
moted for the past twenty years, and this has had a considerable ef-
fect on all endangered species. The more the celebrated species
were sold the easier it became to sell them, but also the more difﬁ-
cult it became to call attention to or get support for their less fa-
vored brethren. Having been told so much about the desperate
straits of a few creatures, the public naturally assumed that the less
advertised species were of secondary importance and interest. For
somewhat different reasons a similar mindset evolved within the
endangered species establishment. Even for those with strong
professional and personal interest in Other species there were ob-
vious vocational reasons for staying with the star animals, they
being the prime producers of grants, jobs, and reputations.

All of which is understandable and has its counterpart in many
other areas of human endeavor. Nevertheless, the emphasis on a
few celebrity species appears to have narrowed the scope of the
endangered species effort and stiﬂed consideration of using some—
thing other than general sexiness f or determining who gets what.

One seemingly reasonable alternative to the present way of do—
ing things would be to rank the species and parcel out aid to them
according to what might be called their degree of preservability.
Those with the best survival prospects and whose problems can be
most immediately, effectively, and cheaply addressed would be
high priority candidates for assistance. Below them (strictly in ad-
ministrative terms, since all are otherwise equally good, in the
several senses of the word) should be the least salvageable, or
those that can only be maintained if we devote a disproportionate
share of our available resources to them. How these criteria might
affect our dealings with the condor and ferret, principal beneﬁ-
ciaries of the present approach, is thought-provoking.

Not even their most passionate advocates suggest that we can
restore condors and ferrets as self-sustaining, free-ranging spe-
cies, since this would involve returning sizable tracts of the coun-
tryside to the condition they were in during the Pleistocene in the
one case and the early nineteenth century in the other. This being
the reality, condor/ ferret authorities now generally favor im-
pressing most or all of the surviving individuals into captive
breeding programs and then re-establishing their progeny—if
there is any—in controlled outdoor environments.

So far no California condors have reproduced in captivity. The
record with ferrets is only a bit better. In the early 19705 nine
animals were caught in South Dakota for this purpose. Four died
immediately from having been injected with the wrong distemper
vaccine. The other ﬁve were sent to a federal wildlife lab in Patux-
ent, Md. There they produced ten offspring but none lived for

 

more than a day or two. The last of the captive adults died in 1979.
Since then no other ferrets have been found in South Dakota.

That neither condors nor ferrets have been bred and reared in
captivity doesn’t mean they won’t be, but bringing this about will
almost certainly be a tricky, expensive, long-term project. (Hu-
man nature being what it is, the professional challenge of and the
rewards that would come from pulling off such a high-tech feat
may be an important if seldom discussed reason why most biolog-
ical boﬂins favor this approach.) However, even if the captives do
reproduce successfully, it’s assumed that their descendants can
only be returned to and survive in bits of their ancestral habitat if
they’re carefully supervised, more or less in perpetuity. Some
plans for such restocking call for high-security sanctuaries in
which the animals can be protected from human encroachment,
predators, and disease. It’s expected that the preserves will be
managed so as to maintain and subsidize natural food sources and
that, especially with the condor, direct feeding—making and lay-
ing out carrion—will be required. Also, since these re-established
populations will be small and isolated, mating will have to be con-
trolled, perhaps artiﬁcially arranged, to assure genetic vigor.

There are sharp technical disputes within the endangered spe-
cies establishment about how best to proceed with captive breed-
ing and release work, but there’s general agreement that this is the
way to go, that with the condor and ferret there is now no other
option. This isn’t the case.

A mother solution would be to treat the condor and ferret, so far

as their natural survival goes, as terminally endangered spe-
cies. There have been such animals, and considerable evidence
suggests that these two are in this category. If so, common decen-
cy demands that we make them as comfortable as possible by pro-
tecting them from trophy hunters and curiosity seekers, and most
especially by calling off the researchers and managers. (During
the past twenty years, students, generically speaking, have been
the most formidable known predators of condors and ferrets,
eliminating more than 30 either by removing them alive from the
wild or by directly, if accidentally, killing them in the course of
this hands-on work.) Beyond that, the most sensible and sensitive
course would be to leave the still-free survivors pretty much
alone, and let nature take its course.

Most knowledgeable condbr and ferret people believe that, if so
negiected, both creatures would soon disappear. This might not be
such a terrible thing as is commonly, reﬂexively thought. As has
been noted, the functional importance of the condor and ferret is
now symbolic, not ecological. The passing of two such celebrated
species would dramatically call attention to the process of extinc-
tion, and the ways our activities now inﬂuence the process. Also, if
the condor and ferret were to go we might be more greatly moti-
vated on behalf of other species that are headed in that direction.

So far as compassion is concerned, there’s no evidence that the
last condor or ferret will be in any special agony because it’s the
last. If they were allowed to meet their fate in their own way and
time, this would at least seem to be a more digniﬁed end than
having it manipulatively prolonged, essentially for our sake.

Particularly in regard to the ferret, whose habits are very poor-
ly known, there’s another possibility. These animals may be more
numerous and tenacious than we think, and leaving them alone
could be the most sophisticated preservation plan. In the past

twenty years we’ve found only two colonies. Shortly after we did
so the South Dakota population disappeared and the Wyoming
one was reduced to, at most, a tiny fragment.

Logically and sentirnentally there are things that recommend
benign neglect, but it’s very unlikely that it will be recommended
any time soon by preservationist authorities. The condor and the
ferret have received so much attention, and so many institutional
activities now revolve around them, that even to consider pulling
the plug—an expression—on them requires more courage and
candor than any authorities have or perhaps should have.

Because of our feelings it’s doubtful that we can keep our hands
oﬂ" such species. Therefore a second, more practical, plan is to go
on handling them but be more forthright about what we’re trying
to and can do with them. Speciﬁcally, aesthetic considerations
underlie captive breeding and release plans—the attempt to give
the illusion that we’ve preserved condors and ferrets as and where
they once were. However, even if all goes very well, we will, in

 

Not to recommend them directly, but to illustrate the possibili-
ties, some, among many, promising candidates for increased at-
tention would be:

0 Being the principal ecological systems makers of this world,
plants are of more signiﬁcance than animals. And because of their
stationary habits and modest needs, even extremely rare ones are
often preservable. For example, according to the Nature Conser-
vancy, a conservation organization with strong botanical inter-
ests, there’s a West Virginia mountaintop that’s the home of 18.
rare and endangered plants, including the white alumroot and Mi-
chaud’s saxifrage. The present owner of the property thinks it has
possibilities as a recreational development and therefore the ask-
ing price is $750,000. Even so it seems like a good preservative
bargain, being a one-shot expense that would more or less perma-
nently secure a cluster of species for less than is now being spent
each year on two dozen condors.

0 There are a number of small, endangered ﬁsh—chub and dace
types—whose preservation wouldn’t interfere

 

with hydroelectric or navigational projects as

 

fact, have produced these animals as we do poodles, and will man-
age them like domestic stock. Rather than playing out this compli-
cated Charade for the sake of appearances, we might give thought
to establishing a national endangered species zoo. There’s no rea-
son to believe that condors, ferrets, and other eligible species
would be less comfortable in these circumstances than in con-
trolled preserves with ﬁeld biologists having at them with radio
collars and manipulating their diets and sex lives. Also, in an ac-
cessible, attractive 200 the creatures would be more useful than
elsewhere to us and therefore to many other species. Each display
would be accompanied by literature and audio—visual materials
explaining why the beasts came to be in such an exhibit. Besides
being educational, creatures in a facility of this sort could be more
efﬁciently and cheaply managed than in wilder, brushier places.

To go back to the notion underlying these revisionist sugges-
tions. It is that too much of our available aid is going to a few
celebrated creatures, mainly because they are celebrated. If less
were done for them—and the savings weren’t transferred to, say,
defense or highway projects—more could be done for a larger
number of species that are as deserving and, in many cases, more
naturally preservable than the greatly advertised ones. Doing
more to prevent plants and animals from becoming basket cases
or, even better, becoming ofﬁcially endangered, might be more
compassionate and certainly more cost-effective than concen-
trating so much of our effort on gaudy crisis patients.

 

long as the streams in which they live are kept
ﬂowing and are monitored and protected accord-
ing to existing clean water laws. This would bene-
ﬁt not only the ﬁsh but also many associated spe-
cies, including our own. (If we became as much
interested in the condition of aquatic plants and
animals as we are in the condor and ferret, we
would probably deal more vigorously with acid
rain and other pollution.)

o The common loon, an adornment to our north-
ern waters, is rapidly declining. The presumption
is that things have gone bad in the lakes it inhab-
its, but there hasn’t been the wherewithal to ﬁnd
out precisely what has happened and may further happen.

0 What the endangered grey bat—and several other bats—most-
ly needs is to have a few of its breeding caves protected from van-
dals and development. Again, this would be a multi-speciﬁc good
work. As insectivores, bats, much more than carnivores, are niche
makers. Among other things a number of rare invertebrates are
dependent on guano deposits these mammals leave in caves.

0 To think big, think of the woodland caribou, which could prob-
ably be permanently re-established in the mountains of the north-
west for less than is spent on condors each year. A hale, hearty,
adaptive species, the caribou, once released, would shortly be-
come self-supporting, beneﬁt other natural communities, and
make the countryside more interesting for us.

A personal note. I think the endangered species program is one
of the most worthwhile of our national endeavors, because com-
passionate acts are generally good for those who attempt them.
Also, this work has dramatized a reality that’s important for us to
keep in mind—that we now have enormous power to aﬁect the
nature of this world. I’ve been especially engaged by the condor
and black-footed ferret. Like many others I ﬁnd them appealing
and cautionary animals. Wherever they’re headed, they have my
best wishes. However, it seems at least worth thinking about the
possibility that the relationship that has evolved between them
and us has exacerbated rather than helped endangered species’
problems; and it may not even be in their best interest. [:3

Betsy Beaver Pays
Visit To Decatur Courthouse

Anyone on the square in Deca-

sidewalks a little more crowded
than usual. ,

Betsy the Beaver was making
her way around the courthouse
square with friend Peter Milling-
ton last Friday to protest the use of
the steel jaw traps in the United
States. ,

Millington, with the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation, has
been touring the country with
Betsy, trying to arouse a grass—
roots sentiment against the use of
the trapping device.

“The United States is the last
country in the world to continue
using these traps in a large quant-
ity,” Millington said. “The trap is

banned in virtually every other
country.”

Millington said his group is
against the use of the trap because
it does not discriminate with its
victims, thereby injuring innocent
animals, and is very painful and
agonizing.

“There are plenty of other ways
for trappers to trap beavers with-
out using the steel jaw trap,” he
said. “It is simply inertia on the
part of the trappers that they keep
using these traps that belong to
the 17th century.”

Millington and his group pres-
ently have 108 cosponsors for his
cause, and are hoping to generate
more support in Congress through
this grassroots campaign.

handles about 12,000 animals a year.
The problem, according to Assistant
Manager Connie McClung, is the
shelter is built on a land fill and is
sinking. “It is getting to the point
that it would be unwise and unsafe to
keep it,” she said.

The shelter has about 12,000
square feet and even though the
proposed shelter may be only a little
larger at 12,000 to 17,000 square feet,
McClung said it is the design that
makes the difference. .

The existing shelter holds about
300 animals; the new one will allOw
over 400 animals to be kept a one
time.

The new Shelter will be complete-
ly enclosed and climate controlled.
Holding pens for livestock will also
be provided in the new shelter.
Among the deparment’s hopes for
the new facility are veterinarian
rooms and classrooms. The shelter
hopes to employ a full time animal
doctor in the future.

The shelter also hopes to arrange
for the Animal Control Academy in
Alabama to teach classes in De-
Kalb. .

McClung said most animal control
units in the country do have a full
time staff veterinarian, but in
DeKalb County, budget considera-
tions have made it impossible. A
veterinarian’s salary runs between
$30,000 to $40,000 a year.

Pearson said people need to
realize though, that the unit spends
about $15,000 a year treating injured
animals that are picked up and they
would save that cost with an in-
house vet. An in-house vet would

also provrde some relief to the

problem by neutering and spaying

strays that are picked up and later

Animal. Control Unit is a better

ado t-a-pet pro am in con unction
wit the DeKa Humane iety.
About 3,000 animals were adopted in
1985, with 12,000 being picked up by
the staff or brought in by private
citizens. Pearsonsaid about 240-250
animals are adopted every month,
with summer and Christmas months
being heavier times of the year.

With the hopes of a vet, come
hopes for a spay/neuter program.
McClung said it had been tried
before by using commercial
veterinarians, but they wanted to
raise the price and the animal
control unit could not agree to that.

Pearson said they are investigat-
ing a plan to either offer discounts
on adoptions of a spayed or neutered
pet or offer incentives to have the
surgery done after the pet is
adopted.

A stricter ordinance preventing
cruelty and stating “attractive
nuisance” definitions are also on the
drawing board, McCall said. State
laws on the subject of cruelty are
vague said McCall and the county
law will close some of those
loopholes and make it a misde-
meanor to leave animals in the car
with the windows rolled up.

Pearson has received several
reports of dog fighting in the county
and he wants to tighen laws to
prevent the occurrence.

The “attractive nuisance” or-
dinance would set out guidelines for
people with animals in heat to
prevent herding of the male dogs.

Of course, with new ordinances, a
new employee is required to enfore
the codes. The Animal Control Unit
relies on the police department now
to investigate reports of animal
cruelty, but Pearson said they would
like to hire a full-time investigator.

Cobb probes bow-and-arrow attacks
on pet cats near Marietta apartments

 

By David Corvette
Staff Writer

 

Marietta police and Cobb Coun-
ty Animal Control officers are in-
vestigating reports of cats being
shot with a bow and arrow, authori-
ties said Wednesday. .

Animal Control Spokeswoman
Angela Farmer said the attacks
have occurred over the past week
or 10 days in theFranklin Road
area of Marietta, where many
apartment dwellers keep cats as
pets. Two confirmed cat shootings
are under investigation, as well as
about 10 unofficial reports, she said.

Apparently only one of the pets
has survived the shootings, she said.
It was grazed in the head with an
arrow that appeared to have been
shot from a longbow, she said.

The cat’s owner, Marti Farthing

of Franklin Road, said her cat

Frick, a 10-month-old male tabby,
was shot Saturday about 4 am. out-
side her apartment. '

' “We last saw him about 3:30. He
was just fine, prancing around chas-
ing crickets. But when we checked

on him again, he had an arrow in

his ear. I was hysterical,” she said.

She said the arrow was about 24
inches long with a rounded point
used for target shooting. The arrow
had blue feathers.

Mrs. Farthing said staff at the
Cobb Emergency Veterinary Clinic,
where she took her cat to have its
wounds stitched, informed her that
another cat had been brought in
earlier with a crossbow dart in its
head. Apartment complexes in the
Franklin Road area have posted
warnings to pet owners to keep
their animals inside, she said.

“Whoever’s doing it has to be
pretty sick,” she said. “I thought I

left all this kind of behavior behind
when I left New York, but I guess I
didn’t.”

No suspects have been discov-
ered in the investigation, Mrs.
Farmer said.

“We do suspect it’s either an
adult or a teenager, because it re-
quires a lot of strength to pull the
bow back,” she said.

Anyone caught shooting pets
faces prosecution under state and
county animal cruelty laws. The
maximum penalty for the misde-
meanor offense is a year in jail and
a $1,000 fine.

If a crossbow is being used, the
offender also could face prosecution
for possession of the weapon, which
she said legally can be used only by
handicapped bow hunters who are
unable to drawback the string on a
regular bow. '

The Douglas County Sheriff’s Department has a new
canine officer on duty. ,

Kilo, a lié-year-old Labrador retriever who cost the
Sheriff’s Department $4,750, isireplacing Bandit as

Douglas County’s new drug-sniffing; narcotics investiga-

tions dog.

Bandit, the department’s first Labrador, was killed
in early January when he escaped from his training pen
and ran in front of a car. \

Kilo was brought from Billy Smith’s Kennel near
Houston, Texas. Smith supplies drug-sniffing dogs to [)0
lice all over the country.

"‘Kilo is a good dog and has great potential,” said
Sheriff Earl Lee. The dog is now an officer and will
have to earn his rank — just like pe0ple, said the sher-
iff.

“He’ll go through extensive training just as any oth-
er officer. Right now he’s working one hour a day, and
as soon as we get some changes made in the depart-
ment [that is, adjusting the trainer’s schedule so he’ll
have time to train Kilo, and completing paper work],
he’ll be going out in the field,” Lee said.

It has taken almost six months to replace Bandit,
who was memorialized by friends and fellow officers
who had become attached to him. He had six years’ ex-
perience on the force and numerous awards to his cred-

t.

[But Kilo is not just a substitute dog. He comes high-
ly recommended from Billy Smith’s Kennel and is actu-
ally the third canine to 'be considered by the Sheriff’s
Department as a replacement for Bandit.

Protesting Proposed Transfer Of Monkeys
Demonstrators carrying placards Saturday protested the proposed
transfer of 15 monkeys from the National Institute of Health to the
Yerkes Primate Center at Emory Un
Springs Monkeys,” the animals are currently in NIH custody, after
having been the subject of studies at the Institute for Behavioral
Research in Maryland. The researcher was convicted of seven counts
of cruelty to animals in connection with the studies. The local chapter
of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which sponsored the
protest, wants the monkeys sent to a privately-owned San Antonio,

Texas animal sanctuary, but NIH plans to transfer the animals to

 

 

Yerkes for continued research. PETA spokesman Nancy Quentzel said

Antarctica ozone loss proves greenhouse

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON — A dramatic
loss of ozone over Antarctica
proves the greenhouse effect is
real and presages a gradual warm-
ing of the Earth that threatens
floods, drought, human misery in a
few years and — if not checked —
eventual extinction of the human
species, scientists warned Tues-
day.

“I believe global warming is in-
evitable; it’s only a question of
magnitude and time,” Robert Wat-
son told the Senate Environment

subcommittee on environmental
pollution.

“We can expect significant
changes in~climate in the next few
decades,” said Watson, predicting
that if nothing is done to slow
ozone-depleting air pollution, tem-
peratures around the world could
rise as much as 10 degrees.

atmospheric program for the Na-

tional Aeronautics and Space Ad

peratures should be nearly 2 de-
grees higher in 20 years, “which is

Sherwood Rowland, a University
of California chemistry professor,
said that “if you have the green-
house effect going on indefinitely,
then you have a temperature rise
that will extinct human life” in 500

Last 2 whales
united for life,
scientists hope

ORLANDO (AP) -— Two false
killer whales, the last of a pod of
27 that beached in the Florida
Keys last week, were reunited
Friday in the hope that the social
creatures will bolster one an-
other.

Florida Sea World spokes-

' woman Donna M. Donaghue said

the whales remained in poor
condition, but the one that was
being nursed at a Sea World study
center on Long Key had gained
enough strength to be trucked to
Orlando during the night.

The 450-pound, 9-foot-female-
was reunited with the other survi-
vor, an 8-foot, BOO-pound female,
after being unloaded from a shal-
low, water-filled box with foam-
rubber cushions, Donaghue said.

The 25 whales that have died
since the mysterious June 5
beachings are being frozen for fu-
ture study at Sea World, Donog-
hue said-

Tissue samples have ‘ shown
that 90 percent of the pod suf-

fered from pneumonia and kid-

ney problems.

The false killer whales that
stranded themselves on two tiny
islands near Key West were be-
lieved to be the same ones that
tried twice to beach themselves
275 miles up the Gulf coast, off
Fort Myers Beach and Sanibel Is-
land, a few days earlier. Volunt-
ers pushed them back to sea both
times.

False killer whales, which
have life spans of 25 to 35 years,
resemble killer whales, but are
slimmer and reach about 18 feet
in length while killer whales grow
to about 30 feet.

Pop star Michael Jackson has applied'for a state

home, which already houses a chimpanzee, two 11a

Jim Zobel, patrol captain in the state Fish and

officials assume Jackson did not intend to illegally
import the giraffe when he had it shipped from a
Missouri breeder to his property in Encino.

“We’re dealing with an innocent in terms of what
he knows about animals,” Zobel said. “We have to
lead him by the ban .”

Zobel said there have been no problems with

- The director of the Los Angeles
City'Zoo has been fired for his
inability to solve what his boss
called “a series of internal prob-

lems" at the Grifﬁth Park facility, . .

City Hall officials said Thursday.
Warren Thomas, director of the
zoo since 1974, was dismissed
Wednesday from the 373,000-13-

James E. Hadaway, general man-
ager of the city’s Recreation and

Hada'way declined to discuss de-
tails of the action against Thomas
“on advice of the city attorney's
office and because of possible liti-
gation.” ~

“AllICansayisthatduringthe.

continuous internal problems at the
zoo," he said. '

‘ . 'NotbyAeeidest’ .

Thomas said the fact that the zoo
went from a “substandard” institu-
. tion when he took over 12 years
ago to “one of the foremom zoos in
the world . . . did not happen by
accident. '.
‘ “For someone to tell me they lost
confidence in my ability to manage
thezoo,inmymind,failsto
compute."
‘ He said his telephone line has
been “hot" with calls from zoo
directors all over the world ex-

pressing their shock at his firing

and their support for him. .
He added that he received a
notice dated last Friday “that I was
to appear at a disciplinary hearing
forxxthe express purpose of firing
me. - , - ,
“I had virtually no time to do
anything because I had to appear
on Tuwday. I was served with a
notice of discharge at 1:50 pm.

poured my heart and soul into it for
12 years. The end result speaks for
itself. It’s a superb zoo." g
Thomas as temporarily replaced

Budget chief backs zoo director

By PATRICIA CHARGOT
Free Press Staff Writer

Detroit Budget Director Walter Stecher
on Thursday defended Detroit Zoo Director
Steve Graham against an allegation by some
zoo employes that he diverted $53,000 of.
zoo renovation money to tear down the
Holden Great Ape House and Amphitheater.

“He’s 1,000 percent correct,” Stecher!
said, referring to Graham’s statement;
Tuesday that the allegation was a “complete I
falsehood.”

Stecher said the money “did not come out
of the 200’s budget, but came out of city
funds for demolition” and was approved by
City Council. “It had absolutely nothing to

do” with $1.5 million earmarked for renova- '

tion of the lion, tiger and elephant buildings,
Stecher said.

The allegation surfaced earlier this week
in an unsigned letter written by several
disgruntled zoo employes.

26 Years Afterllis Incredible Story Was Told in ‘Born Free'

George Adamson, 80, Is
Still Battling to Save
His lions From Poachers

At 80, George Adamson still lives among his
beloved lions in the wilds of Kenya — 26 years af-
ter the amazing success of the heart-tugging book
and movie “Born Free” that told his incredible
story.

“I have an affinity with the lions. They seem to like
being near me,” confided Adamson, who lives on a 500-
square-mile animal reserve.

“Often when I’m in the bush, lions appear and settle
down all around me. When
I decide to move on, they
follow me. As time goes by,
I’m becoming more lion
than man.”

Adamson has Spent the
past 30 years reintroducing
lions born in captivity to
the wild. He and his wife
Joy —- whose book “Born ..
Free” told about their life in the bush — worked side by ; ,_.
side for many years. She was killed by poachers in 1980 “; '
—— but he’s still a loving father to the lions on the re- f
serve. Adamson lives in the wild and sleeps out in the i
open. He rises at dawn each morning, bathes in muddy,
diseaseridden river water, then spends the day follow-
ing lions through the bush. - ‘- ‘

Despite his age, he’s incredibly fit and active.

“I eat what I like, but I drink far more than I
ought,” he said. “I start with gin at 11 in the morning, .2" .
switch to whiskey in the late afternoon and keep going ,ij
with that until I go to bed. In the past I used to handle
the lions, but nowadays I don’t like to do that. I’m wor-
ried that they may think all humans are friendly. If they
get that idea in their heads, they’d make very easy tar-
gets for poachers.

TAMPA TRIBUNE

2 rare, white
tigers are born
at Miami zoo

There are only about 70 white
Bengal tigers in the world, most of
them in captivity and descended
from a tiger captured in 1951.

MIAMI (AP) — Two extremely rare, ﬂuffy and
white Bengal tiger cubs were born at MetroZoo some-
time early Friday, zoo officials said.

The pair, both Weighing about 21/2 pounds and appar-
ently female, were taken away from their parents,
mother Kanpur and father Lucknow, and placed in incu-
bators at the zoo shortly after the cats’ keeper discov-
ered them Friday morning, said zoo spokeswoman Janet
Ross. ‘ i

“We didn’t even know the mother was pregnant,”
Ross said. “We pulled them from the parents because
they are so valuable.”

The cubs appear to be in good condition, but the first

several days of their lives are critical, Ross said.

“They will try to get them on a regular feeding
schedule they will be bottle fed by a zookeeper, hand
raised,” she said. “They’ re like regular house kittens
with their eyes closed. ”

“If they do OK, we should be able to display them to
the public in a few weeks. One is striped with tiny black
stripes and the other is virtually stripeless,” she said.

Ross said that throughout the world there are only
about 70 white Bengal tigers, most in captivity.

“They were referred to as ‘white ghosts’ in India be-
cause they were so rarely sighted and their (off-white)
color, ” Ross said. The tigers are essentially albinos that
have been bred from a single tiger captured in 1951 by
an Indian maharaja, Ross said.

MetroZoo purchased the cubs’ parents, both from the -

same 1983 litter at the Cincinnati Zoo, for $60, 000 each.
The two were named after cities in India.
A fully grown cat weighs about 400 pounds.

HOUSTON POST - June 3, 1986

No animals seriouslyhurt

Man arrested after ramming
tractor through pens at zoo

By JACK DOUGLAS
Post Reporter

 

A man With a “crazed” look on
his face and a Bible in his pocket
tore into several animal pens at
the Houston Zoo on a stolen trac-
tor Monday before being wrestled
into custody in front of two be-
mused rhinos, police said.

No animals or humans were se-
'riously injured, but a pregnant
white-striped antelope, known as
a nyala, may lose its offspring
because of “extreme stress,”
zoo officials said.

An emergency response team

at the zoo, armed with shotguns
and riﬂes, stood by in case any of
the animals attempted to charge!
for freedom. But none of them,
including antelopes, buffalo, ze-
bras and two rhinos, attempted to
escape through the gaping holes
in their pens.
. A 28—year-old man was later
charged with felony theft for al-
legedly stealing a heavy front-
_end loader, used to crash through
the pens, and with felony crimi-
nal mischief for allegedly tearing
up the zoo grounds. He was being
held in the Harris County Jail in
lieu of bonds totaling $7,000.

The suspect, who refused to
talk to police at the zoo, later
identified _ himself as Jean Hus

Baptiste of the 12000 block of
Martin Luther King. That name
had not been confirmed by late
Monday, Houston police spokes-
man Al Baker said.

The man somehow managed to
steal a tractor from a road con-
struction site in the 4300 block of
Scott —— about two miles from the
zoo — about 7:30 a.m., police
said.

Within 15 minutes, the suspect
had crashed through a locked
gate on the east side of the zoo,
tore into the hoofed animal pens
and then drove into the rhinocer-
os pen, officials said. About 15
bewildered police officers and zoo
officials remained in cautious
pursuit until the heavy tractor
got caught on a rockpile in the
rhino pen, giving police a chance
to jump on the man. .

Sgt. M.S. Garrett of the city
park police division said the rhi-
nos “could have gotten out and
trotted down Main Street if they
had wanted to. But they were
happy at home, so they didn’t
leave.” '

Z‘oo Director John Werler
said he was not surprised that all
of the animals stayed inside their
opened pens. “Those animals
have been in those enclosures for
years. That’s been home for

. them, and they’re very comfort-ﬂ

able with that space.”

However, he said a pregnant
ante10pe, Flash, may lose its full-
term offspring because of the
panic caused by the intruder.

It will be several days before
it’s known whether Flash, who
was running a high temperature
after the incident, will lose the
offspring, zoo veterinarian Joe
Flanagan said. .

Flanagan said several other
antelopes received minor injuries
because of panicking.

Werler said the 200’s 9:30 a.m.
opening ' was delayed an hour
while temporary repairs were
made to, the pens. Permanent re-
pairs could take “as long as a
week,” during which time the rhi-
nos Samburu and Marsabit will
remain in their “nighthouse,” the
director said.

He said the repairs will cost
“at least $5,000 or $6,000,” and
that there would be an additional
$3,000 cost if the antelope under-
goes an abortion.

Werler said the man made sev-
eral “religious comments” while
marking his destructive path
through the zoo.

Zoo Prepares To Greet.
Four Unusual VIPs

By Marjorie Mandel
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff ,

St. Louis will welcome four important residents
Thursday, but they won’t get .the usual VIP treat-
ment. They will arrive in steel-and-wood shipping
crates and be whisked into quarantine for several
weeks.

Charlie Hoessle, director of the St. Louis Zoo, . to do.
said the “ready-made family” had excellent breed- -
-ing potential. Only one gorilla has been born at the
‘ Zoo, and that was about 18 years ago.

“Gorillas are similar to people in that you can’t

prearrange friendly companionship,” he said. “One

The St.

reason why many gorillas have never
bred in captivity is that they have not
. been with acompatible mate. With
the disappearance of the gorillas’
habitat; the tropical rain forests in
Africa, zoos have increased their em-

phasis on propagation.”

The four gorillas will replace the
three that lived in the Zoo’s ape
house. The apes were lent to other
' zoos when the building was torn down
to build the Jungle of the Apes. “

7 Hoessle said the Zoo’s chimpan-
zees, which went to the Cleveland
Zoo, and the orangutans, which went

to the Miami Zoo, had been returned ,

to St. Louis and were in quarantine.

.. Hoessle said Zoo officials had de-
cided not toseek the return of the
three gorillas. “They’re better off left
where they are,” he said.

Rudy, the male, is at the Cleveland
Zoo. Trudy, the older female, is at the
Buffalo Zoo in New York. And Muke,
the younger female, is at the Bronx
Zoo in New York City.

The Lincoln Park Zoo has 23 goril-
las, one of the largest collections in
the world, said Don Garbarino, a
spokesman for the Chicago Park Dis-
tribt, which operates the 200.

Two veterinarians, a zoologist and
a zookeeper from the St. Louis 200
plan‘to leave today for Chicago. On
Thursday morning, each of the goril-
las will be tranquilized and taken to
the hospital at the Lincoln Park Zoo,
where they will undergo a medical
checkup and tests, Hoessle said.

As the gorillas wake up, they will

be placed into shipping Crates. The '

crates will be loaded into two vans
for the trip to St. Louis.

“Every effort is being made to ca-
ter to the comfort and needs of the
animals,” Hoessle said.

Two zookeepers from the Lincoln
Park Zoo will accompany the gorillas
and will remain in St. Louis until Sun-
day to help ease their transition. Pet-
er Clay, one of the zookeepers, said
he would miss the four gorillas, but
added: “They will be better off in a
brand new and much larger habitat.”

Fred is the only one of the four
born in the wild; the others were born

at the Lincoln Park Zoo. Fred arrived .
at the zoo in 1961, when he was 1 or 2. .~

Clay said Fred was a very experi-
encedleader and “fairly easygoing,
even passive.”

But on April 3, Fred got out of the
display area when a latch on an inte-
rior door was left unlocked, Garbar-
ino said. .When Jim Higgins, the head
keeper, walked through the door,
Fred knocked him down and bit him
on the arm, breaking several bones.
Higgins stopped Fred by grabbing his
head from behind and ramming his
fist down the gorilla’s throat, momen-
tarily gagging him, Garbarino said.

Clay described .1010, who is going
through the equivalent of his early
teen-age years, as “hell on wheels.”

“He’s really full of himself and a '

mini-hunk at the moment, weighing
150 pounds or so. He’s very active
and playful and likes to show off.”

The two females are half-sisters.
The gangiy, long-limbed Kivu was ig-
nored by her mother and was raised
by zoo staff members and volunteers
until she was a year old, Clay said. As
a result, she is friendlier to people
and shows less fear than the other
gorillas.

Matadi is “fairly aggressive and in- '

dependent,” Clay said. “She is very
self-assured and confident and
doesn’t back down very easily when
there’s a contest over a treat.” ‘

Dangerous dogs
to be executed

fﬁunder new law
“Council OKs ordinance

by MARK OBBIE
,Post Reporter

 

With barely a whimper of pro-
.test, the Houston City Council on
Tuesday unanimously passed an
Tordinance ordering a mandatory
death penalty for dangerous dogs.

j Dogs can earn the “dangerous”
label in two ways: inflicting seri-
”ous injuries on a person or biting
people in two incidents within a
one-year span.

City officials say the tough new
regulations may not result in
many lethal injections for danger-
ous dogs, but the ordinance will
send a message to pet owners who
‘don’t, control potentially vicious
dogs.

“We think that the citizens of
this city need to be protected from
.such animals, and if the owners
won’t take that responsibility,
then we will,” said the city’s
._._.health director, Dr. James
Haughton.

Fines don't work

1, He said the problem has not
gbeen cured by just slapping own-
iers with fines.

3, “If you have an animal that is a

Rhabitual biter, no amount of penal-u

«W to the owner is going to cure
that dog,” Haughton said.
..,.- “There’s been a leash law on
the books of this state for over 100
“years, so to require people to be
"responsible for their pets is noth-
ing new.” '
3"" Robert Armstrong, chief of the
city’s bureau of animal regulation
and care, said the ordinance may
,result in the destruction of only a
handful of the city’s hundreds of
[thousands of dogs. But Armstrong
said the law gives the city a weap-
on against “the kind of animals we
do want to get off the street.”

" repeat the word “no” after it is

Houston officials have ap-
atproved an ordinance saying that
.“dogs deemed “dangerous” be
‘0 killed by lethal injection. A dog
-‘ is considered dangerous if it in-
;‘flicts serious injury in a first of-
fense or if it bites pe0p1e twice
1 “Within a year. '

Phe: 0405 ' '

The ordinance -- which has
been in the works since last fall,
when the City Council upped the
maximum fine to $1,000 for owners
who let dangerous dogs run loose
-— is a reaction to recent, highly
publicized attacks by pit bulldogs.

But, unlike other area cities toy-
ing with the idea of banning that
breed, Houston devised a legal, ge-
neric description of a dangerous
dog.

“I commend the city for not sin-
gling out a particular breed,” said
Robert Shannon, executive direc-
tor of the Houston Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

Councilman Jim Greenwood
said some animal advocate groups
are worried the ordinance is
“harder on the dogs than it was on
the owners.”

Shannon said the new law is ac-
ceptable because it has important
safeguards, such as an exception
for cases in which a dog is pro-
voked to attack. .

 

 

 

“There are really no dangerous

dogs, there are dangerous own- ‘

ers,” Shannon said. He said no or-
dinance will do away with the
“macho” dog owners who inten-

. tionally raise their dogs to be

vicious.

The ordinance exempts police
dogs doing their duty and guard
dogs who bite an intruder, as long
as the guard dog is properly
penned.

City health officials say reports
of dog bites are on the rise and-

could hit 3,000 when the fiscal year '
‘ ends June 30.

But fewer than 20 dogs per year
would be eligible for the new death
penalty, judging from current sta-
tistics, the city’s animal control
chief said.

5 severe cases

Armstrong said only five people
in Houston in the 11-month-old fis-
cal year have been injured so bad-
ly by dogs that they required hos-
pitalization.

In another “half a dozen to a
dozen” cases, animal control offi-
cials have tracked down dogs that
have two biting incidents on their

; records, Armstrong said.

An ordinance passed last year
allows animal control officers to

tattoo dogs that have bitten people
" and have been quarantined for 10

days to check for rabies.

But Armstrong said city veteri-
narians don’t usually look for the
inconspicuous tattoos —— inside the
ear, lip or thigh — unless someone
complains that a dog is a notorious

‘ biter.

The city already destroys about
3,600 stray animals every month

, and sells another 2,500 per year

year for scientific research.

City Council members changed
only one part of the ordinance pro-
posed by the Health and Human
Services Department. Instead of
defining repeat offenders as dogs
that bite pe0p1e on separate days
within a one-year span, they
adopted Councilwoman Eleanor
Tinsley’s proposal to include dogs
that bite people in two incidents,
regardless of the day.

GRENADA, Miss. — A man who snagged a 10-
foot-long alligator and tried to stuff it into the
trunk of his car because he wanted his picture tak-
en is due to pay a $600 fine tomorrow in Justice
; Court, officials said yesterday. -

i Bobby Yancy, 41, of Grenada, was charged May
24 with possession and transportation of an endan-
’: gered species after conservation officers Lyndall

Carter and Keith Carver saw the live gator’s tail
sticking out of the trunk of a-car parked in down-
town Grenada, Carter said yesterday.

Yancy told lawmen he lassoed the reptile on a
river bank in Bryant near Grenada Lake, Depart-
ment of Wildlife Conservation District Supervisor
Terry Thomas said yesterday. “He said he just
wanted to have his picture made with it.”

Yancy pleaded guilty to the charges Saturday.

“Everybody’s been calling me because they’re
wondering if we’ve got gators around here,”
Carter said. “We’ve got a nice recreation area here

in Grenada, and people are afraid to go swimming.
“That’s the first gator I’ve ever seen in Grenada
County. I think it’s safe.”
He and Carver were on their way to do some rou-
tine patrolling on the lake when they stopped at a
service station and noticed the gator’s taii hang-

ing out of the trunk.

When the officers headed, toward the car, the
driver jumped in and led the officers on a chase,

Carter said.

“He lost us, or rather, we lost him.”
Yancy was arrested about two hours later when

THE HOUSTON

POST - June 2, 1986

Help break vici

Dear Readers: The month of
June is significant in many ways.
The vacation season has arrived,
hot weather is well established,
kids are out of school, ﬂeas and
ticks are everywhere, baseball
pennant races are taking shape
and the swimming pools are
crowded. '

For animal welfare and control
personnel, June is a sad time as it
is the peak at the season for un-
wanted cats and kittens. Spring is
the primary breeding season for
cats so the supply of kittens is
abundant by June.

Unfortunately, June 1986
doesn’t seem to be any better
than preceding years as thou-
sands of kittens are being han-
dled by animal welfare and con-
trol organizations throughout the
Gulf Coast area. Sadly, the ma-
jority of kittens are abandoned,
diseased, abused and have to be
humanely destroyed to preclude
further suffering.

Most of the mother cats are
suffering from malnutrition, in-
ternal and external parasites and
are so frightened that they ap-
pear to be vicious, attacking ani-
mals. Few people are interested
in adopting an adult cat with
these problems.

During late May and through-
out June, personnel at the Hous-
ton SPCA find cats and kittens
wrapped in pillow cases, sealed
boxes or buckets with wire tops
which are thrown over the perim-
eter fence during the night. Oth-
ers are often found in garbage
dumpsters and drainage ditches.

, It’s impossible to describe the
emotional trauma one experi-
ences when Opening a bag, box or
bucketand finding several little
balls of fur with big frightened
eyes, obviously hungry and usual-
ly covered with ﬂeas. .

Each year, those of us engage
in animal welfare and control ac-
tivities ask the same questions:
Have we reached a point in our
society where people have so lit-
tle respect for life that helpless
cats and kittens are regarded as
simply one of society’s disposable
items?

There have always been indi-
viduals who don’t like cats. But
has a segment of our population
become so vehement that war has
been declared to destroy the bulk
of the cat population? The answer

 

I realize many people who de-
stroy cats or kittens would deny
being associated with either
group, but their denial com-

pounds the severity of the prob-

lem. The various comments from
these people are usually quite
loud and emphatic.

' “They’re only cats or kittens,”
they say. Or “You animal lovers
are too emotional.” Or “There’s
too many problems in the world
to worry about cats.” These are
typical remarks heard often dur-
ing June. '

Yes, I agree, they’re only cats
or kittens; but let us not forget
that we human animals are re-
sponsible for the cat’s domestica-
tion, thus we should assume the
responsibility for their well-be-

Without question, we so-called

times. Emotional sensitivity con-

need to teach our children that

Scientists track panther kitten
as he learns life 1n the wilderness

TALLAHASSEE (AP) — One of the newest members
of the endangered Florida panther community is a
healthy male who is gaining an average of two-tenths of
a pound daily while becoming less dependent on moth-
er.

He probably has begun stalking small animals, learn-
ing skills that could someday help him chase down deer.

Panther No. 10, as he is called by Florida Game and

Fresh Water Fish Commission scientists, is barely nine

months old. He weighs 55 pounds.

The commission knows a lot about the kitten because
it is wearing a radio collar like the one its mother wears.
It is the first panther kitten to wear the device, which
scientists hope will enable them to acquire knowledge

, about the panther’s habits that could be used in the ef-‘

fort to save the animal from extinction.

The commission estimates that the Florida panther

population numbers anywhere between 20 and 50.

Scientists say that at first, the kitten remained with
his mother at all times, but lately has started to lag be-
hind, sometimes by as much as two miles.

“I think he is beginning to make some of his own
kills,” said Dave Maehr, a commission biologist. “He
probably can’t take down a deer yet, but he may be
preying on small animals like armadillos or raccoons.”

Maehr said the mother and kitten tend to stay in one
place for several days and then move on for 15 or 20
miles, then stop and relax for several days again. He
said the stops may occur when the mother has killed a

large animal and the two cats are feeding on it.

Biologists think the kitten will stay with his mother

until she breeds again.

Another possibility is that the kitten will be looking

for his first mate at the same time. Scientists hope the
collar will help them understand how a male selects a
mate and sets up a territory.

The commission’s panther trackers first discovered
the paw prints of a kitten in December in the Faka-
hatchee Strand.

“We knew where the kitten was, because we already
had a radio collar on its mother," Maehr said. “We had
collared her a year earlier, when she was three or four
years old.”

The tracking team located the kitten in January with
the help of several dogs. When the team arrived, the kit-
ten had clawed his way 30 feet up a cypress tree. After
the dogs were put away, scientists set up a net to, catch
the animal in case he fell out of the tree. They tranquil-

ized the kitten while the mother watched from several”

hundred yards away.

While the kitten was unconscious, a veterinarian

wormed and vaccinated him and took blood samples.
The procedure lasted about 90 minutes. The kitten then
was placed in a small tent to protect him from the ele-
ments and predators until the tranquilizer wore off.

In May, the scientists thought the kitten was outgrow!

ing his collar so they refitted him.

Order in the Wild

If Our Wilderness Is Sometimes a Playing Field,
Then We Need Rules for the Game

BY IRA J. WINN

Hiking one Sunday in

the Santa Monica
. Mountains, I was passed by
half a dozen parties of
young people, each loaded
down with bundles of beer
and the paraphernalia of
our age. The forest and
brush bore stark evidence
of such comings and go-
ings. Shouting, radios blar-
ing, the groups stampeded
along the trail, exuding
both the magic of youth
and the folly of those
grown profligate with
man’s most precious re
sources. They were no bet-
ter or worse than the tens of
thousands who crowd the
once pristine valleys in a
headlong rush to “do the
parks” of our country. Peo-

 

Ira j. Winn is professor of
education and urban stud-
ies at California State Uni-
versity, Nortbridge.

ple of all ages and condi-
tions have forgotten—or
simply do not know—how
to greet nature in quiet rev-
erence.

Some people, city dwell-
ers especially, associate na-
ture with noise and chal-
lenge, the cry and chatter of
the jungle. But much more
common in our temperate
zones are the long spaces
in mountain and desert,
forest and plain, where the
absence of harsh sound is
the startling characteristic.
Broken now and then by an
animal call, a buzz, a break-
ing branch, the long si-
lence lies at the core of wil-
derness experience.

Understandably, many
people headed for a vaca-
tion need a period of ad-
justment to raw nature. But
many never do adjust. The
fear of quiet, the sudden
realization of our own pu-

Al Carbon

niness before a far-reach-
ing universe of space and
time is too hard to face.
Quiet—deep and long qui~
et—can disturb and de-
press urban people, a fact
noted at the turn of the cen-
tury by sociologist Georg
Simmel. Urban people, he

Observed, begin to feel

lonely and afraid if left
without the constant back-
ground of noise and agita-
tion. Today, quiet has be-
come an aberration, and
nature has come to be
thought of as “unnatural.”
And as city life has grown
ever more complex, it’s be-
come commonplace to see
runners and strollers with
headphones, completely
insulated from the few re-
maining hushed sounds of
nature—the whoosh of the
wind, the soothing rustle of
leaves, the slap of waves
against the shore.

Rather than leave wilder-
ness and parkland in peace,
we insist on “civilizing”
them, and as we do so, the
wild lands become a play-
ing field on which to act
out tensions carried over
from urban life. In addition
to preening and loud dis-
play, we clutter campsite
and trail with the claptrap
of home. Urbanites press to
bring ever more roads and
city comforts to park areas.
Few simple camps are left.
Some national parks look
like supermarket parking
lots. Motorcycles roar into
campgrounds late at night;
pots and pans are banged;
motorized homes are ma-
neuvered; the human voice
babbles on, drowning out
the hoot of the owl. Human
noise despoils the sanctu-
ary we profess to seek.

Disregard for the natural
stream of things is a
learned behavior, taught in
subtle ways, as when we
watch trained animals wig-
gle and leap on command.
For the bribe of a handful
of fish, the creatures of the
sea perform like slaves. An
interesting spectacle may-
be, but one that habituates
people to the idea that na-
ture exists mainly to enter-
tain humans—the lords of
the universe.

If the wild lands are
sometimes our playing
field, then we need rules
for the game. Wilderness
privacy and wilderness
rights must be defined. The
wilderness game is, admit-
tedly, different from our
more familiar sports: There
is no point score or finish
line, no leagues or cheer-
ing fans. But it shares the

Continued on Page 16

 




need for rules of order.

The basic rule of the “wilderness
game” is a simple one: Let nature
predominate. Wild lands cannot be
equated with a license to play savage.
Shooting at rocks and cans, CB chat-
ter, painting or carving on rocks and
trees is not “getting back to nature.”
However innocently pursued, actions
such as these disrupt and destroy the
wilderness experience for all caring
v151tors, as well as intrude upon ani-
mal and plant communities.

Wilderness rules cannot be found

Guidelines create the necessary
and proper atmosphere for play. Play-
er and spectator alike come to thrive
on these rules. We don’t demand a
right to a fourth strike. The public
doesn’t wander across fairways under
a claim of public ownership of the
course. This behavior isn’t “natural”;
it’s taught and learned as part of the
rules and conditions of the game, the
hidden price of entry.

French said the male peregrine
now in Boston appears to be the
same adult that spent the summer
of 1985 here. If so, he would be a 2—
year-old that was released as a
chick atop the federal courthouse
in Boston in 1984, the first year of
the peregrine restoration project.

The female. he said, has been

identified as a peregrine released
by Canadian authorities, prob-
ably last year.
_ He said they make regular vis-
its to the Bank of New England, .
One Beacon Street, 28 State St.,
the Custom House tower and other
tallbuildings and bridges.

they land on the ledges. People lit—
erally call me up about once a
week and say, ‘He was right here
next to me.’ Unfortunately. I
haven’t been able to get that
close.” French said.

He would like to get up close
enough to identify the birds
through the bands placed on each
of their legs when they were re—
leased. French is particularly in—
terested in the colored band and
the three—digit cede that identifies
each bird released in recent years
through the Peregrine Fund of
Ithaca, NY.

Just in case the birds have the
urge to breed, Fisheries and Wild-
life has placed a nest tray for them
on an undisclosed downtown
tower. It contains gravel that mi—
mics the loose stones they would
use for a nest on a cliff ledge in the
wild.

"It's almost too late for any-
thing more to happen this year,”
French said. "We expect them to
be here through about the first
week in September and then mi—
grate.” .

Around the Northeast, the
birds appear to be regaining a
foothold they lost three decades
ago. Five nests have been found in
New Hampshire, at least three in
the Adirondacks of New York and
one in Vermont. as well as three
pairs nesting on bridges in New
York City.

The Boss Dog

BY VICKI HEARNE

Louis Dedeaux knows
dogs pretty well, and is
a good trainer and breeder,
so you would expect him to
have control of his dogs
and to be a pretty accurate
prophet of their behavior,
health and so on.

He is all of this, but he
has this one dog he named
Honcho. On the registra-
tion papers, that’s Honcho
de Dedeaux, which, ifI un-
derstand correctly, trans-
lates roughly as “De-
deaux’s boss.” Dedeaux is
proud of Honcho—his
household manners, his
work in tracking and obedi-
ence, and the points he’s
won toward his breed
championship.

Dedeaux bred Honcho
himself, and Honcho is one
of his better dogs, even
though he didn’t have a
wonderful start in life. He
and his brother, Kaiser,
were the only two pups
who survived his litter, and
Honcho was undersized,
which is a problem for a
Rottweiler, since size and
strength are deeply prized.

Q

Who's the boss? Honcho with his charge Adam Dedeaux.

But Dedeaux kept him be-
cause, he says, otherwise
“it was all there.”

Part of being a good
breeder is the willingness
to take such risks, to make

what appear to be guesses
about an unpromising pup-
py. One just calls them
guesses as a sort of short-
hand. What goes into a
phrase such as “it was all

there” is a great deal of
knowledge and experience.

There was everything

there and then some. Hon-
cho is one of those dogs
that defies what expert
breeders and handlers
know. (Of course, part of
being an expert breeder
and handler is knowing
that you’re going to come
up against dogs like Hon-
cho that confound your
theories.)

I don’t mean that Hon-
cho isn’t a wonderfully
well-built, well-behaved
and well-trained Rottweil-
er. He does fine in obedi-
ence activities and is a pret-
ty good all-around house
dog. Still, his name is Hon-
cho, and he lives up to it.

In fact, I suspect him of
overweening ambition.
When he was 3 months old,
for example, he had parvo.
Parvo is a dangerous canine
disease, and Honcho had it
bad. Since he was an under
sized pup, there was a lot of
head-shaking and worry
that he wouldn’t make it.

DENVER POST - June 5, 1986

 

 

MOrris living
9 high lives

Famous cat of TV ads is bored,

of course, in Denver interview

By David McQuay
Denver Post Staff Writer

Morris looked bored. .

He has met so many reporters and has heard all the
questions. How old he is, how much does he weigh, does
he really eat 9-Lives or does he pig out on stuffed trout
and mouse mousse. Holy cow, his eyes said. Take me
back to the hotel and give me a double catnip.

Morris came into town Wednesday to kick off
Adopt-a-Cat Month and attend the opening-night
performance of “Cats,” which will benefit the Denver
Dumb Friends League. He will arrive in a limo at Denver
Auditorium Theater at 6:45 tonight, and after the show
he’ll be sitting in his director’s chair at a champagne
reception. Then it’s back to the comfort of suburban
Chicago, where he lives with his handler, Bob Martwick.
They traveled 40,000 miles last year; he and the cat ﬂy
first class. -

Actually, this is Morris the Second, but Martwick would
never tell you that. Morris the First died several years
ago at the age of 19, well fed to the end. Martwick, a
bulldog-faced man who was wearing a Charley the Tuna
tie clasp and a crew cut, discovered the original Morris in
a Chicago animal shelter while scouting for an orange cat
to use in an ad. Martwick also trains dogs. He recently
worked with 11 Irish wolfhounds for a toilet-bowl cleaner
commercial.

 

. The Denver Post / Bill Wunsch
Morris was discovered in an animal shelter in Massachusetts.

 

Please see MORRIS on 4-0

“The original Morris was so laid

back, so sell-possessed," Martwick
said. His original name was Lucky,
but an ad writer gave him the per-
snickety name of Morris. “He had
a torn eyelid. It gave him a kind of
squint.” Morris the Second listened
to his handler, looking a little cata-
tonic. ~

M artwick says Morris the First
sashayed into a meeting of ad
agency people, got right up on the
table and stayed there. “That must
be the Clark Gable of cats!” the

ad-agency director exclaimed. And
that’s how Morris got in the cat-
bird seat.

But The Finicky One’s death
would be catastrophic to sales, so
the search was started for an heir.
Before Morris the First went to
that great supper dish in the sky,
Martwick spent seven years
looking for Morris the Second.

He found him in an animal shel-
ter in Massachusetts, and he looks
like Morris the First, without the
squint. Remembering his roots.
he’d rather sleep in a cardboard

 

box than in his beautiful bed. He

has the run of the house and a

fegced-ntis area, and Martwick’s

0 er ca are not rmi

the star. pe tted near
Nothing much fazes him. He sits

for pictures, yawning occasionally,

waiting for the next meal. Mar- .-

twick uses food to handle Morris
the Second through four to six
commercials a year, and the hefty
14-pound orange tiger cat readily
comphes. The day before a shoot-
ing, his food is cut by half or so.

The toughest take is ettin '
to stare at the camegra forg 33v???-
three seconds and licking his
chops. He does indeed eat 9-Lives.
He knows how to steal food
open cabinets and get into the
(dry-food) bags,” Martwick says.

. Morris the Second is 7 now, en.
Joying middle age. Is Martwick
looking for a Morris the Third?
He’s always on the lookout, he
says.

nside the Goetz Animal Hospital at the Cincinnati Zoo, a lioness roared.
Behind bars, a leopard paced slowly, and a pampas cat, no larger than a
domestic Tom, pranced, hunched his back and spat at the four people in
front of his cage. ‘

Dr. Betsy L Dresser led visitors through the quarantine room. Trim
and cheerful with short, blond hair, she paused to jingle her keys 1n front of the
pampas cat, careful to keep her hand away from the cage. “He’s such a cute little
guy,” she said. The cat rushed the bars, swiping at the keys with claws sharp
enough to slash to the bone.

Dresser is a reproductive physiologist. Her days around the zoo and the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati -- where she is on the staff of the Ob-Gyn Department -—
are spent collecting semen from rhinos or transferring the fertilized eggs of one
eland into the uterus of another.

Her studies represent the last hope for survival of many of the species in the
Cincinnati Zoo. As director of the zoo’s Wildlife Research Federation, Dresser is '
adapting techniques developed for the propagation of domestic dairy cattle to zoo
animals -- techniques such as artificial insemination with semen frozen a year
earlier, transferring an embryo from one antelope to another, or split-
ting an embryo to produce identical twins. The program at the medium-sized

Cincinnati Zoo has earned the respect of much larger institutions.

“There's no question that‘ they’re right up

there,” said Dr. Janet Stover of the Bronx Zoo. »

“They’re the ones getting results.”

Dresser explained that the federation, formed in
1981, is an alliance of the Cincinnati Zoo, King’s
Island and the University of Cincinnati. The
results of its work are inside a cubicle with a sign
on the door reading: “Frozen Zoo. ”

In the sparsely furnished room are a micro-
. scope, photographs of research animalsand a
stainless steel container the size of a picnic cooler.
Inside the portable freezer, plastic straws of fro-
' zen semen and embryos from bongos, elands, ele—
phants, turtles and lions are bathed in liquid nitro-
gen at -196 degrees C. The cold stops all metabolic
activity so that important genetic ‘material is
preserved intact. “The embryos just sleep away
until we’re ready to use them,” Dresser said.

Ultimately, the frozen embryos and frozen
semen will be used to increase animal popu-
lations in zoos and in the wild. The freezer is
an icy ark against an uncertain future. “Realistic
cally, we won’t save many species,” Dresser said,
“but we’ll save some.”

Wildlife is threatened with extinction on a scale
matched only by the Biblical flood of Genesis.

Nate Flesness, director of the International Spe-
cies Inventory System (ISIS) at the Minnesota
Zoological Gardens, recently completed a six-
month study on the destruction of wild habitat for
the US. Office of Technology Assessment. He con-
cluded that half of the world’s rain forests will be
destroyed by the year 2000.

have been studied or named.
In all probability, by the year 2000 somewhere
between 250,000 and 1.5 million species will be
extinct. That works out to one species gone per
hour.”

In August 1985, Ed Maruska, director of the
Cincinnati Zoo, delivered a report on the black
rhino. The world population stood at 8,000. Six
months later, the population was reduced to 5,000.
Based on those kinds of statistics, one conserva-
tionist predicted that within 50 years, 1,500 to
2,000 “charismatic megavertebrates” — the large,
spectacular 200 animals -- won’t be able to survive
on their own in the wild.

The threat to the animal world isn't just lack of
habitat and reduced numbers. Wild animals are
threatened from a dwindling gene pool. Inbmding
begins when the herd of any species falls below
300. Animals lose their resistance to disease and
natural predators; genetic shifts take place --
undesirable traits passed on through enough gen-
erations become a normal part of the genetic
make-up.

f "1.

In the place of wild habitat, zoos provide a tem-
porary sanctuary but, like Noah’s Ark, are limited
in their ﬁnances and space. All the zoos in the
country could ﬁt within the city limits of Cincin-
nati. Under thew conditions, conservationists are
pushed into the uncomfortable podtion of deciding
which animals to save. ~

That is one reason reproductive research is
important to Betsy Dresser. “I think all animals

have a right to be here,” she said. “It’s a rare 1

art form. This is not just a job to me; it’s my life.

But we're all faced witha lack of space. Ifwecan.

just bring genetic material out of the wild instead
of the animals what a conservation tool that will
u.”

Freezing the genetic material needed for the
continuation of important bloodlines is like storing
a set of encyclopedias on a computer disk. Enough
seminal fluid and fertilized embryos to repopulate
the 67 acres of the Cincinnati Zoo could be stored
in several containers similar to the one in the Fro.
zen Zoo. Frozen genetic material also provides a
means to transfer those bloodlines between wild
populations and zoo populations without transfer-
ring disease or harming the animals.

Maintaining a diversity of species is important
for other reasons: As Dr. Barbara Durrant, repro-
ductive physiologist at the San Diego Zoo
explained, “We don’t know how the medfly or the
screwworm ﬁts into this very delicate ecosystem

of ours. We don’t know what enzyme that might
cure AIDS or cancer is found in an endangered
species. From a purely selﬁsh standpoint, we need
to preserve wildlife in the event that humans can
beneﬁt."

Zoos helped diminish the captive animal gene
pool. Not long ago, they were like warring Greek
city-states, viewing themselves as entertainment
facilities in competition with one another for the
public’s dollar. That attitude was reflected in
breeding practices 'that stressed distinctive color
patterns and unusual markings, much the way a
horse breeder attempts to pass on selective traits.
The ﬁrst attempts at reproductive control in the
19508 followed the example of domestic animal
bmders. Detailed stud books were developed to
track the pedigree of zoo animals with carefully
selected bloodlines. That selectivity contributed to
the breakdown of genetic diversity in zoo popula-
tions. ~

entertainment to education, and finally as

the last stronghold for species with no h0pe
in the wild. New roles resulted in a new attitude of
cooperation between zoos.

“The days of the warring city—states are over,”
said Dr. Warren Thomas, director of the Los
Angeles Zoo. “We recognize that we are the cus-
todians of the rarest creatures on Earth. It’s
obscene to think of our animals as anything but a
legacy that all of us should prepagate the best we
can."

That attitude is reflected in current zoo breeding
practices of which the Cincinnati Federation is
just one component. The American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums (AAZPA) over-
sees a Species Survival Program (SSP) for 37

I n recent years, the role of zoos changed from

 

 

 

endangered species. Two hundred and ﬁfteen zoos
from 14 countries participate. Careful records are
maintained on computer at. ISIS in Apple Valley,
Minn, but the emphasis is reversed from the
selective breeding of the 19508. “The goal of breed-
ing today is to avoid selectivity,” said Tom Foose,
conservation coordinator of the AAZPA. “We try
to equalize bloodlines and preserve what nature
created”ltalsoisreflectedintheCincinnati
Federation, made up of a state university, a not-
for-proﬁt corporation and a private amusement
park. King's Island and the zoo share Betsy
Dresser’s salary, and they channel research funds
as grant money through the university.

While 215 zoos contribute to the SSP programs,
there are fewer than a dozen with a commitment
as large as that of the Cincinnati Federation
(others include the Brookﬁeld Zoo in Chicago, the
Bronx Zoo, the San Diego Zoo, the National Zoo in
Washington, D.C., and the Minnesota Zoological
Gardens in Apple Valley,'location of the AAZPA
Species Survival Program). This year, more than
$155,000 has been budgeted for Dresser’s research.

Betsy Dresser does not take credit for the federr
ation, but instead credits its team effort. Nonethe-
less, the federation is a product of her determina-
tion. Around the zoo, Dresser works as if the
biological clock working against the animal king-

dom is in the next room. “What we need is i.
more Betsys,” Ed Mamska said.

Her scientiﬁc work and her religious con-
victions are complementary; in her spare
hours, she teaches life science at Cincinnati
Bible Seminary. “Science sometimes moves
too fast for me. But I don’t think my work
conflicts with Christian beliefs. Animals
were put under our care. The way we’ve
manipulated the environment, we’ve pushed
the animals out You could see this com-
ing.” " _

Betsy Dresser has been interested in zoo
animals and conservation since she was a
child, and was a summer volunteer worker
at the zoo. The loss of wild species convinced
her that she wanted to contribute some-
thing. When she went to Ohio State as

an undergraduate, however, there were no
formal zoo courses.

“I had to choose between veterinarian
medicine, nutrition or reproduction,” she
said. “I thought about how we used to get
animals from the wild. Sometimes we killed .
the parents to capture the offspring. We
can’t do that today, so I chose reproduction.”

At Ohio State, she learned the techniques
of artiﬁcial insemination and embryo trans-
fer that have revolutionized the dairy indus-
try. -

t the end of her undergraduate stu-
A dies, a scholarship brought Dresser

to the Department of Ob-Gyn at the
Cincinnati College of Medicine. Her interest
in wildlife conservation never had wavered.
Back in Cincinnati, she began to talk to
King’s Island and the Cincinnati Zoo about
research.

 

 




. 4r

At that time, research in exotic species
was a limited science. Dr. David Wildt of the
National Zoo had been studing physiology of
wild cats since the mid-19703. In 1977, at the
University of Utah, Dr. Tom Bunch had
transferred the embryo of a mouflon, an
exotic species of sheep, into a domestic
sheep, an event largely ignored beyond a
handful of zoo enthusiasts. Dr. Durrant
established a program at the San Diego Zoo
in 1979, also working with sheep and goats.
In 1981, Dr. Stover’s research at the Bronx
Zoo produced the ﬁrst exotic embryo trans-
fer in a zoo when the embryo of a gaur

-— wild cattle that once roamed southeast ’

Asia and India — was successfully trans-
ferred into a Holstein to produce Man-
har, a bull calf.

With a wide-open ﬁeld and few entrants,

the triangle of two zoos and a university ‘

seemed an ideal way to split the costs . of
research. After a year of red tape, the feder-
ation was formed in 1981.

For three years, Betsy Dresser was the
director and staff of the Cincinnati Zoo
Wildlife Preservation Federation. Seventy

percent of her time was spent raising money ‘
for basic tools; a microscope cost $30,000, a 1

portable freezer cost $16,000. It wasn’t until
1984 that she added an assistant.

Besides a shortage of time and money,
lack of knowledge about the reproductive
cycle of most exotic animals impeded
progress. The science was new. Reproduc-
tive management in dairy cows was devel-
oped with the aid of millions of research
dollars and experiments with hundreds of
thousands of animals. It took 50 years to
fully understand the physiology of a Hol-
stein even though they are not in the least
shy about their breeding habits.

However, exotic animals are shy and
secretive while breeding. The only way to
tell what’s going on is to anesthetize them,
and that can be dangerous. “The misconcep-
tion that a lot of us had when we jumped
into this is that the technology would be
similar to domestic animals,” said Dresser.
“We were wrong.”

In the ﬁrst experiment of the new federa-
tion, three tiger embryos were transferred
into a lion. If the experiment had worked, it.
would have been the first exotic cat transfer
and the ﬁrst successful transfer between
‘ species in a zoo. After 60 days of a 100-day

gestation cycle, the lion was back in heat.
Whether or not the animal aborted or was
never pregnant is a matter of speculation.
Lions are carnivorous and eat their fetuses.
“We can only suspect that she was preg-
nant,” Dresser said.

Near the end of 1981, Dresser turned her
attention to the eland, an antelope in the
same family as the Holstein. Ten months
were devoted to learning the hormonal cycle
of the eland. Fifteen attempts were made to
transfer eland embryos into Holsteins.

When that approach failed, a new strategy .

was devised. ,

 

 

On Sept. 9, 1982, 18 embryos were flushed
from the uterus of a pregnant eland. Three
were transferred into recipient elands that
were in the same reproductive cycle; the rest
were frozen for future projects. The first

i
l
l
l

breakthrough followed nine months later. i

On June 14, 1983, an eland calf named “ET”
was born from a nonsurgical embryo trans-
fer.

Work with the eland, a common species,
provided the groundwork for experimenta-
tion with an endangered animal. The bongo
is a rare reddish-brown African antelope
with white stripes and twisted, spiraled
horns. There are only 60 in captivity; the
largest herd (between 22 and 26) belongs to
the Los Angeles Zoo. ‘

Dr. Warren Thomas, director of the Los
Angeles Zoo, was aware of the research in
Cincinnati and was eager to cooperate.
“When it comes to reproducing animals in
captivity, the days of by-guess-and-by-God

are over. We cannot guarantee the future of
our animals without solid answers. He

' supervised the breeding of several bongos

for the experiment.

In August 1983, Dresser, Dr. Lynn
Kramer, - the Cincinnati Zoo veterinarian,

r _ and Dr. Earle Pope, then with the University
; of Alabama at Birmingham, boarded a plane
to Los Angeles for a historic trip.

During the previous three weeks, several
Cincinnati elands were treated with hor-
mones so they would come into heat at the
same time as the bongos in the Los Angeles

, Zoo. The elands had each previously given

birth and proved themselves good mothers.
The work in Los Angeles began at 6:30

. a.m. A bongo was sedated and flushed. Seven

embryos were collected and were packed
into pipettes. Disney Studios was on hand to
film the event.

The experiment was an effort in transcon-
tinental coordination. Fresh embryos have a
viable life of approximately 12 hours. By
noon, the team was in the air. The pipettes

containing the embryos were strapped under

the arms of Dresser and Pope to simulate
the warm bongo womb in transit. Three-
and-a—half hours later they were on the
ground in Cincinnati rushing to the zoo. Only
five of the embryos were viable: four were
transferred into elands; one was transferred
into a bongo that had never given birth.

After 100 days, the animals were palpated. ;
Only one of the elands revealed a pregnancy.

Later, the bongo proved to be pregnant. For
the next 170 days, volunteers monitored the

animals around the clock. ,
On May 31, 1984, Dresser watched the

eland give birth to a bongo. She said it was

like a dream; years of planning come true.
Her ﬁrst thought was: What if it’s not a
bongo?

. The strange calf seemed to be a mystery
to the surrogate eland mother. She looked as
if it were the ugliest child she had ever seen,
but she raised it.

 

 

I

Six days later, the bongo gave birth to a
50-pound calf. It was hand-raised.

Other breakthroughs followed. On Oct. 15,
1984, veterinary history was made when a
37-pound eland calf was born from a frozen
embryo. The successful freezing meant that
in the future, Dresser might go into the wild
to collect embryos and safely transport
them to the States. It also meant that
important genetic material could be saved

-until habitable land was available.

The Cincinnati Federation has earned the
attention and respect of the zoo world. Cin-
cinnati was selected as the site for the Fifth
.World Congress on Breeding Endangered

' Species In Captivity, to be held in 1987. At
., the end of last year, Dresser toured Kenya

and the People’s Republic of China to discuss

exchange programs. The trips were promis-
’ mg. a team of four Chinese veterinarians is

scheduled to study embryo transfer with
Dresser this summer; she is awaiting USDA

approval to import genetic material from the
wilds of Kenya.

Meanwhile, arrangements have been made

with an unidentiﬁed foreign zoo to store the
Kenyan material until it can enter the

United States.

While the federation’s research holds
promise, some in the zoo world question the
emphasis and attention given to embryo

. transfer work over basic research.

Dr. Durrant of the San Diego Zoo ques-
tioned the economic feasibility of embryo
transfer for reproducing dairy cattle.
Though the dairy industry funded the
research that perfected the technique,
embryo transfers represent about 2% of all
the dairy cattle births. Artiﬁcial insemina-
tion, which takes a backseat to embryo

Q transfer in the zoo world, modernized the
,5 dairy industry and accounts for 80% of all
? registered Holstein births.

“We’re not going to revolutionize the ani.

mal kingdom with embryo transfers," Dur-
rant concluded. “It’s just not viable.”

Artiﬁcial insemination, while effective, is

1. pedestrian and mundane, Durrant felt.
; Embryo transfer, on the other hand, has all
the earmarks of science ﬁction.

“Zoo staffs are under pressure from their

; own zoos to concentrate their work in that
‘ ﬁeld because it brings in research money,”
Durrant said. “Now and then our owr
‘ research staff has to say: “Wait a minute
We’re not a PR department.’ We’re doing
embryo transfers in two mares from oui
exotic horse herd. They both have ‘foun
; der,’ an inflammation of the hooves, ant
can’t mate naturally. We’re doing ET’:
' because they represent important genetit

material, not because embryo transfer is z
neat thing to do.”

 




   

 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 

resser conceded that a small staff

and limited funds account for the

emphasis on embryo transfer work
at Cincinnati. “Initially, we nwded some-
thing visible to draw the public’s attention.
In the long run, I think it will prove to be

, beneﬁcial. It’s provided us with the money to 1
go back and do more basic mearch. Today, ‘
we’re devoting a lot of research to artiﬁcial '
insemination.”

In the sixth year of the Cincinnati Zoo
Wildlife Federation, Dresser took a long
view. The years past had resulted in several
scientific breakthroughs. A hope for the
future is shown on a wall of the Goetz Ani-
mal Hospital - an artist’s rendering of a
new hospital and educational facility dedi-
cated to reproductive management. It would
provide a full-scale ark and employ more
Noahs for conservation. Dresser hepes to see
it constructed in time for the 1987 interna-
tional congress.

.. “The frozen zoo concept and the ability to
transfer genetic material is going to be an
important component of wildlife conserva-
tion,” Dresser said. “We can’t be all things

to everybody.” Instead, she has concentrated

her efforts on that one aspect of reproduc- ;
tion. “There’s a lot we don’t know,” she i
said. “But we’re making a dent in it.” I ‘

COLUMBUS (AP) - Detroit Zoo Director Steve
raham and Columbus Zoo Director Jack Hanna
insist that they respect ‘each other. But Graham

. refused to let Hanna into his zoo Tuesday.

“I consider him a friend,” Graham said. But, he
dded, “He is custom-made for the media.”

‘

Hanna said he went to the Detroit Zoo this week
because the Detroit Free Press wanted to take his

0

icture there.

Graham said he refused to let Hanna in because he
tried to carry in a baby wallaby‘, which would break
quarantine policy at the zoo.

Hanna likes to take animals with him on trips to
promote the Columbus Zoo, including several times

the television shows “Late Night with David Let-
terman” and “Good Morning America.” ,

ButGraham says taking animals out of zoos for
such purposes is“prostituting animals.”

He also said Hanna exploited animals and was

“the worst purveyor of false zoological information I

avegever met in my life. Every time I see him on
V, he makes some egregious zoological error.”

Hanna called Graham a “very bright fellow” and
said that he did not mind the criticism.

“I have one job to do, and that is to build the beSt
200 I can,” he said. “The rest of the zoos don’t pay

He said 95% of the nation’s zoos took animals on
educational programs. He said the animals did not
suffer and that he had never lost one.

Baby or! _

By Allyn Stone

- Wild gulls at the San Francisco Zoo
stepped up their predatory attacks over the
weekend from baby animals and hot dogs to
a 3-week-old girl. :

In a scene reminiscent of the movie “The
Birds,” a weekend outing at the zoo turned into a
nightmare for an Oakland family when their in-
fant daughter was attacked by a hungry gull.

"The fact that she did not have her eyes
gouged out was just a miracle,” said Wendy Clark,
whose daughter, Aimee, was attacked. “It seemed
like something really unnatural. I’ve read “Jona-
than Livingston Seagull,’ and I thought of them as
just these beautiful birds that fly around.”

Head zoo keeper Joe Rusk said the episode
was not surprising, because gulls are predators
that feed on many things. Constant handouts from
humans have made the birds increasingly bold, he
said.

, “Gulls will go through a batch of ducklings
just like popcorn,” Rusk said.

The baby was attacked Sunday at a snack‘ bar
near the children’s petting zoo. Clark had just
finished nursing the infant and. had placed her in
a basket on'a picnic table. As Clark went to put
food wrappers in a garbage can a few steps away,
little Aimee let out a cry.

Her mother whirled around to see a large
white gull flapping over the baby’s basket, its
claws raking her tiny face. ‘

“It was like something out of your worst
nightmares,” the still-shaken woman said yester-
day. “It reminded me of ‘The Birds.’ ”

The screams of the infant and her mother C

frightened the bird away, and Ai-_
mee escaped with scratches on the
bridge of her nose, her forehead

and one hand.

Clark, a real estate agent on ma-
ternity leave, and her husband,
Alan, a car dealer, packed up the
baby and their other daughter, who
is 21 months old, and left after in-
‘ forming zoo concession officials of

. the scare. - '

“It will probably be a while”
before they return, Wendy Clark

from the hands of small children;_

the zoo replaces such stolen snacks
without charge.

He could not say whether the

gull mistook the 8-pound baby —-

bundled up and wearing a hood
with only her face and hands ex-
posed —— for a morsel of food.

.Gulls often eat living things,
Rusk said, and their appetite for oth-
er birds’ chicks has forced the zoo to
raise baby birds indoors or guard
them closely when they are

tack your child,’ or something like
that.”

Rusk was not too optimistic
about that idea. “We try to hold
back on signs here, or after a while
this place would be just one big plac-
ard,” he said. “PeOple are totally

immune to signs.”

Two of the dogs that were believed to
have been wounded crawled into a'

by members of the Zoo staff.

But the third dog —- a large white ~

“He jumped right over the antelope

said. The fence is about 6 feet high,
he said.

The death of the two blesbok will
be costly to the Zoo, officials said.

The female is valued at $5,000; the
'male at $2,000. The animalsare fairly
rare in North American zoos, and
Hoessle said they were also becoming
scarce in Africa. But the 200 still has
three females and will buy another

The animals, whose bone structure
is similar to that of deer — are red-

their faces. Their weight ranges from
150 pounds for a female to 180
pounds for a male. The animals origi-

Hoessle said. .
To get inside the Zoo, the dogs are
believed to have burrowed a hole un-

— a frequent problem, Hoessle said.

Although Zoo workers periodically

'patrol the fence and fill in the holes,

the dogs continue to dig their way in.
Hoessle said that in the last several

have been threatened by packs of

No recent killings of 200 animals

said. But he recalled incidents dating
back to the 19603 and 19705, in which
three kangaroos and 15 antelopes

“We’ve been very nervous about

A spokesman for the city’s rabies
control office said that his crew had
been investigating complaints of
stray dogs — some traveling in packs
of four or five -- on the grounds of
Forest Park. So far the crew — which
patrolled as recently as Wednesday
morning -- has sighted no dogs.

The spokesman said no one from
the Zoo had called his office recently:
to complain about stray dogs.

The spokesman said he did not rec-

“It’s been a problem off and on,”
he said. “People dump dogs out there
in the park, and it becomes their
home.” Dogs also wander over from
adjoining neighborhoods.

But it is difficult for rabies crews
— with their nets and trucks -— to
catch the strays, the spokesman said.

“It’s almost impossible to catch a

TAMPA TRIBUNE -

Snake man
gets more
company

West German Jurgen
Hergert has been
living in a glass cage
with a number of
poisonous snakes. He
hopes to spend 100 ~
days with the snake.

GULF BREEZE (UPI) -- A re-
searcher living in a snake-infested
glass cage got three new snakes to
replace those that died, but a killer
cobra responsible for most of the
losses made a snack out of one of the
newcomers Thursday.

It was the third snake to be killed
by a Hoot-long Indian cobra that
has shown no inclination to live in
harmony with the others. A fourth
snake was killed by another Indian
cobra.

Herpetologist J urgen Hergert, 43,
said he, is not concerned about the
deaths. He’s using the information
for his research, and several people
have volunteered to help him re-
plenish his stock.

“Everybody’s calling wanting to
donate snakes,” said zoo spokesman
Eric Visser. “He’ll probably get a
bunch more.”

With the way it is going now,
Hergert will need them.

Visser said Hergert told him that
two puff adders will probably die
within five days. They were sick
when Hergert got them and haven’t
eaten since, said Visser.

. “Jurgen says the outlook is not
good,” Visser said.

Hergert, 43, of Schladen, West
Germany, has been in the cage since
March 16 with cobras, rattlesnakes,
puff adders, mambas and vipers.
Hergert ‘hopes to spend 100 days
with the snakes in a bid to prove
they are not as bad as people think.

June 6, 1986

 

 

 

He holds the current record of 90
days set three years ago in Germa-
ny.

Hergert, once promoted as the

“King of Snakes,” put 25 snakes in
the cage a few days before he ent-
ered the structure. He said he de-
cided to put them together early so
they could get accustomed to being
together.

The 7-foot Indian cobra took lit-
tle time showing his spots. The cobra
immediately killed a Russel’s viper.
Several days later, on the day Her-
gert joined the snakes, the same

cobra killed a rattlesnake.

Then last week another viper
was killed and devoured by one of
the other Indian cobras. That left
Hergert with 22 snakes.

Visser said a poisonous Eastern
diamondback, a non-venomous gray
ratsnake and Eastern hognose were
placed in the cage Wednesday morn-
ing, giving Hergert a total of 25
again.

, But on Thursday the population
dropped back to 24 when the killer
cobra decided to make a midday
snack of the hognose.

 




 

 

Dolphin gives birth at Sea-Arama

Calf’s survival
\first in history

of Marineworld

By JIM NEWKIRK
' Post Reporter

 

GALVESTON -—- A 24—year-old
Atlantic bottlenosed dolphin
named Charlie Brown and her

'- newborn calf were drawing the
lion’s share of attention at Sea-
" Arama Marineworld Monday.
- Born Sunday at 6:08 am. the
female calf is the first live dol—
_ phin birth in Sea-Arama’s 20-year
‘ history and is “probably” the
first live dolphin born in captivity
; in Texas, according to Ken Ra-
mirez, director of marine mam-
.. mal training.
" At the facility’s entrance a
message on display announced
the birth, regular shows sched-
uled in the huge performance
tank were toned down to accom-
modate mother and calf, and Sea-
Arama trainers were asking visi-
tors to suggest a name for the
newborn.

Swimming fin to fin in the tank
and climbing the water’s surface
in unison every 15 seconds or so
for a blow of air, mother and calf
appeared in fine form.

The bonding process between
the pair has progressed well, with
the 81/2-foot-long Charlie Brown
assuming the role of the doting
and protective mother, Ramirez
said.

Shortly after the birth, Charlie
Brown began helping the calf to
swim, nudged the calf away from
the tank’s walls, and encouraged
it to nurse. “She’s been a wonder-
ful mother; everything is text-

book perfect,” he said.

Trainer Cheryl Snyder feeds Charlie Brown and her calf.

The calf is 30-inches long,
weighs about 19 pounds and is be—
coming “very playful and very
independent,” he said. The next
two weeks are especially impor-
tant since the calf’s immune sys-
tem still is developing, he said. A
major concern is guarding the
calf against infections and germs,
Ramirez said.

Sea Arama trainers suspected
Charlie Brown was pregnant last

fall after she and a 14-year-old

male dolphin named Big Al began
mating. “We’ve hoped Charlie
Brown and Big Al would get to-
gether. They hit it off pretty well.
If the chemistry is nbt there, they
won’t have anything to do with
each other,” said Gini Brown,
Sea Arama spokeswoman.
Trainers at the facility began a
24-hour watch over the weekend
and early Sunday the calf entered
the aquatic world, tail first,
which is normal for dolphins. The

birth is Charlie Brown’s first calf.
Most calves in the wild have a life
expectancy of 25 years, but in
captivity they could live as long
as 35-40 years, Ramirez said.

Mother and calf will remain in
the performance tank, since the
mother is comfortable there, he
said. The more spectacular stunts
performed by the other dolphins
will be put on hold for awhile,
Ramirez said.

Bear ducks
pursuers,
takes refuge
in woods

By Steve Gaither
Martin, Tenn., Bureau

 

 

CAMDEN, Tenn. — A roaming
black bear, which spent several
hours dodging people and tran-
quilizer guns here Thursday,
has disappeared into a wooded
area in South Benton County.

The bear was last seen about 8
am. yesterday about six miles
south of Camden, said Tennes-
see Wildlife Resources Agency
wildlife officer Mike Stockdale.

“He is in a wooded area with a
- lot of creek bottoms where the ;
houses are pretty well scat- I
tered,” Stockdale said. “He could ,
move a long distance through ‘
there without ever being seen.”

The bear, named “Running ‘
Bear” by the Benton County ‘

 

 

 

Sheriff’s Department, apparent-

ly decided it had had enough of :
city life after a three-hour tour ‘

of the north of edge of town here
Thursday.

TWRA wildlife officer Chuck
Stevens missed the bear from
about 25 yards away with the
tranquilizer gun, which Stevens
explained is more difficult to
sight than a regular riﬂe.

“I’m not making excuses . . .
yeah I am,” Stevens said. “He was
diving off into the woods. I just
hope I get a chance to redeem
myself.”

Stevens said the throng of cur-
ious residents, monitoring po-
lice scanners, were too much for

local law enforcement officials .

to keep away and the confusion
spooked the bear.
“It was a big circus, ” Stevens

said.“ .We don’ t even use the .

word ‘bear’ on the radio any
more.’

Wildlife officers are investiga-
ting each reported sighting of
the bear but lack of manpower

prevents a full-scale search, Ste- ‘

vens said.

If the bear is tranquilized, Ste-
vens said, it will be taken to the
Memphis Zoo and a decision on
what to do with it will be made.

-She was trying to save when she
was struck by an automobile.

_ Blust, 39, of Affton, died Thurs-
day at St. Anthony’s Medical Cen-
ter. She died near-
ly two weeks after ’3‘
she was struck by
a car as she bent
over Snowball.
She was trying to
move the injured
dog from one of
the southbound
lanes in- the 8400
block of Laclede

station Road in ‘3 i u
Blustw '

Affton. _
,SnowbaiL a
white Samoyed, was struck on the
night of May 3 by a car that appar-
ently left the scene. Bleeding from
the nose and mouth, the dog lay in
the road in front of the home of its

owners, the Holt family.

“If it hadn’t been for Barbara,
Snowball probably would have
been hit again and killed,” said
Sharon Holt. '

‘Holt and her family realized too
late that Snowball —- who resem-
bles a German shepherd — must

 

  

have squeezed through a bent part
of the fence in their back yard and
run into the street.

Snowball was struck ,_ once, suf-
fered a concussion and is improv-
ing after treatment at an animal
hospital.

But Blust never recovered.

Blust was struck at 8:55 pm. by a
car driven by Erik B. Nyren, 30, of
Trailaire Court in Fenton, authori-
ties said. _

A breath test showed that Nyr-
en’s blood-alcohol content was 0.13
percent, police reported. Under

Missouri law, anyone with a blood-

alcohol content of 0.10 percent is
considered to be intoxicated.

A grand jury in St. Louis County
will decide whether to charge him,
authorities said.

Blust worked as a laboratory
technician for a group of doctors.
She had been a devoted animal lov-
er all of her life, said her mother,
Evelyn M. Blust.

As a child, Barbara Blust

“brought all the stray animals

home from school,” said her moth-

er. “She even had a rope she kept .

in her desk” to use as a leash.

When she was struck, Barbara
Blust was on her way to see her
Arabian horse, Bennie, who was
kept at the Sugar Creek Ranch.

Barbara Blust also had a habit or

stopping for troubled animals.
“Her {ither told her many a

 

 

time, ‘Don’t stop on a busy road,’ ”
Evelyn Blust said.

In the hospital, Barbara Blust
told her mother that the road
hadn’t seemed busy. “She said she
looked around and didn’t see any
cars coming. The last thing she re-
membered before the accident was
looking at the dog’s tags. At first
she didn’t know why she was in the
hospital.”

Holt telephoned Barbara Blust’s
parents and talked to them about
her progress in the hospital. Holt
said she felt sad that she never met
the woman who saved her family’ s
dog.

EARL KEELEY is a dog lover. The
72—year-old retired widow shares
her trailer home outside Charlotte,
between Lansing and Battle Creek,
with 25 dogs. That’s nothing
compared with the 100 or so dogs she used
to keep at her Lansing dry cleaning. busrness.
“I just can’t take a dog to an animal
pen,” said Keeley. “A dog doesn’t have a
chance there.” -
Keeley’s life revolves
around Wee Wee, Missy,
Princess (who has lost a
leg), Goldy, Dinky (a
Chihuahua), Wire (his
hair is wirv) . Hutty,

Carrot Top (who spends
all day under the TV), Buster, Baby and
Champ, to name just a few.

“Everyone has a name. And every one of
these dogs just loves me to death.”

They eat 50 pounds of dry dog food a
week, which Keeley mixes with hamburger,
rice, bacon, eggs, toast and other goodies.

Her friends Alex and Shirley Bignell
provide free rent, and give Keeley dog food
and groceries once a week. “They like
animals, like I do,” said Keeley.

And a man from Bay City read a
newspaper story about Keeley, and “every .
month, since 1982, he has been sending ‘:
$150. He always ends every letter with ‘God
bless you, keep up the good work and I’ll

For every animal that anarily
Primates accepts, several more are
rejected. Last Tuesday aﬁernoon,
for example, a message was leﬁ on
the ofﬁce answering machine by
someone representing a movie
company seeking a home for

“seve ” chimpanzees used in a
recent picture.”

“Fine if they give us $50, 000 to
build an enclosure, ” remarked
Swett. ‘ °

Right now, a large chimp enclo-,
sure costing that much is under
construction. It will be the retire—
ment home for Chuék and Judy,
two chimps from the Virginia Zoo-
logical Park 1n Norfolk.

The Chuck and Judy story, ‘in-
cluded in the Ann Landers column
last weekend when the columnist
roasted the city of Norfolk for con-
tributing half the cost of the cage
r.‘eror the chimps, IS a good study of a
Etypical case.

Dear Constance:

Thank you for your recent letter expressing your support for the
release of fifteen monkeys from the Institute of behavioral Science
(IBR), and the National Institute of Health. I appreciate knowing
your concern, and want you to know that I have signed the Dear
Colleague letter to the director of NIH, requesting his review of our
request. In addition, I appreciated receiving the column you enclosed
in your letter from James J. Kilpatrick.

While I support humane and necessary research on animals as a
productive source of information to prevent illness on humanity, I do
not support research on animals such as the Silver Spring Monkeys when
the research is inhumane and counter-produCtive.

Neither the NIH or the IBR has conducted research on these fifteen
monkeys since 1981. Because of the inhumane and uncontrolled
treatment of these animals, many have dismembered themselves, and have
thus precluded further proposed research.

Because there is an organization in Texas, Primarily Primates which
has volunteered to take these animals at no cost to the federal
government, and give them the necessary and humane treatment, I
strongly support expediting this process.

 

Again, thank you for letting me know of your concerns with the Silver
Spring Monkeys. I will continue to work for the humane treatment of
animals at every juncture. As issues of concern to you come up in the
House, I would appreciate the continued benefit of your views. '

Everything’s Ducky
For Drake That Reads

By the Associated 'Press
’ DES MOINES, Iowa

T DRAKE University, proficiency in reading is con-
Asidered the norm. But in the case of Sir Lancelot, his
reading ability attracts special attention. -

Sir Lancelot is a duck. ,

“Lance,” as he’s called, is a 9-year-old male mallard
duck that’s been under the wing of Kenneth. Lloyd, a
, professor of psychology at the university. Training Lance
to read was part of an experiment in behavxoral psychol-
AogY; Lloyd simply wanted to find out if an animal could
read. . . ..

“Similar studies have been done With pigeons, Lloyd
said. “But we thought it would be interesting to have a
duck for the university. We like to call it ‘Drake’s drake
reading program.’ ” ‘

Lance’s reading career began several years ago
through a process known as shaping. It’s a gradual meth-
od of changing behavior by selective, scheduled, positive
reinforcement, Lloyd explained. ~ .

In Lance’s case, Lloyd and his students decxded that
every time the duck turned his body, they wouldreward
him with food to see if they could shape his behaVior.

It worked, so the experimenters moved to the next
step, a process called fading. Fadinghas to do With an
animal’s response to stimuli in the envnronment. . _

“Ducks have excellent eyesight and are very senSitive
to color,” explained Lloyd, “so we put black letters on
colored cards. Lance learned that if he peeked at a red
card, we would feed him. So we reasoned that if we
slowly took the color away but left a word such as ‘peck,
he would respond to our command.”

The team gradually faded out color on the cards by

A

Of Pit Bulls, i

By LINDSEY GRUSON
Special to The New York Times

PHILADELPHIA, May 31 - Young .
toughs here are measuring their bark ’
by their dog’s bite. Fighting with pit
bulls, long a problem elsewhere, has
come to Philadelphia.

In the last five years juvenile own-
ers of pit bulls have made the city into
the “dog fight” capital of the East
Coast, the police and animal protec-
tion officials said Friday.

The pit bull has become the
“macho dog” among teen-agers who

' hold fights in basements, abandoned

houses and backyard sheds “just for
prestige,” said Samuel McClain, an
investigator for the Pennsylvania
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals. .

“If another kid calls your dog punk,
which means a coward, you have to
fight it to prove it isn’t,” he said.

In recent months police and animal
protection officers have started a
crackdown on dog fighting. Five boys
ranging in age from 11 to 14 years
were arrested last month and
charged with running a dog-fighting
ring in North Philadelphia. .

The boys, who were charged with
cruelty to animals, were taken into
custody after officials received a tip
about a dog being hanged at an aban-
doned house. Mr. McClain said he
went to the house and found the re-‘
mains of 10 dogs in the rear yard. .

Five years ago, he estimated, there:
were 25 to 50 pit bulls in Philadelphia;
Today, he said, there are 2,300 to,
3,000. Juveniles own 90 percent of the
dogs, which were imported in the
1870’s from England where they were
popular among miners.

The state has become a dog-fight-
ing center because the laws are lax
and Pennsylvania makes little effort
to enforce them, officials acknowl-
edged. Mr. McClain is one of only two
anticruelty investigators here. ,

Unlike most other states along the
East Coast that have made dog fight-
ing a felony or a misdemeanor, in.
Pennsylvania it is a summary of-
fense, roughly the equivalent of a
traffic ticket. The maximum penalty
is a $300 fine and 90 days in jail.

HE BLACK rhinoceros, already an endangered
species, is under attack by heavily armed poachers
in one of its last sanctuaries. Officials in Zimbabwe say
tlhey have shot and killed nine illegal hunters there since
une. ‘ .
The area, the Zambezi valley in northeast Zimbabwe,
had until last year escaped the severe poaching that has

' reduced the world’s black rhinocerOs population by more

than 90 percent in just 15 years.

“It’s a bush war,” said Glen Tatham, a Zimbabwe park
warden who was in New York to raise money for field
radios, motorboats, backpacks and other anti-poaching
equipment. a .

“For the rhinos, the situation is desperate,” Tatham
said.

About 750 black rhinoceroses, the largest group left in
Africa, roam the Zambezi valley, an uninhabited area of
4,000 squareimiles.

“This population is of very great importance for the
species," said Jaques Berney of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species in Lausanne,
Switzerland.

On a morning early in 1985, six of the animals were
killed in five hours. By the end of the year, officials had
discovered 73 hornless carcasses and estimated that
perhaps 15 more lay undiscovered.

“We never dreamed the threat would reach those
proportions? Tatham said. “Overnight, it became a crisis,
and since then, it’s been a real battle.”

Armed patrols have been increased, some including

Effort To Save Black Rhino Becomes Desperate

former guerrillas from Zimbabwe’s war of liberatibn
from white rule. Prison terms for captured poachers
were lengthened to 11 years. But despite the new
measures, so far in 1986, 15 more mutilated rhinoceros
carcasses have been found. ' ,

The hunters kill the animals for their horns, which sell
for thousands of dollars each in North Yemen for use in
dagger handles. Ground-up horns command hundreds of
dollars a pound in Asian traditional medicines.

Despite an international ban on the horn trade,
rhinoceroses have declined rapidly throughout Africa at
the hands of organized gangs, according to international
experts. .

In 1970', about 65,000 lived in Africa. Conservationists
focused their concern on the southern white rhinoceros,
a different species that had nearly disappeared but has
since been restored to a few thousand through the efforts
of several countries.

The alarm about black rhinoceroses was raised in
earnest in 1980, when experts discovered that the total
had fallen to about 15,000. But the slaughter has

- continued. Today, only about 4,500 remain, according to

specialists with the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature, based in Gland, Switzerland.

Many of Africa’s remaining rhinoceroses are in
scattered groups not considered viable by biologists.

' Solitary creatures, rhinoceroses may fail to locate mates

when their populations become too sparse.

Zimbabwe stands out among African countries for its
successful wildlife protection, according to Ingrid
Schroeder, president of the Foundation to Save African
Endangered Wildlife in New York, which has supplied

anti-poaching equipment to the country. But the‘ new
onslaught is taxing its protection forces, she said.

“We knew the pressure would come to us,” Tatham
said. In recent years, rhinoceros populations were
destroyed in Tanzania, the Central African Republic and
Zambia. “It was easy for the poachers to switch to the
Zambezi valley. All they had to do was cross the river.” A
150-mile stretch of the Zambezi River divides the
threatened valley from Zambia.

The'rhinoceroses of the Zambezi valley had not been
hunted for'decades. In some areas frequented by tourists,
the animals had lost their shyness, making them easy
prey.

Since the beginning of 1985, Zimbabwean guards
reported having shot and killed nine poachers who were
armed with high-caliber hunting rifles. Cartridge
magazines from AK-47 automatic weapons have also
been found. Eight other poachers have been captured
and sent to prison.

All those killed or captured have been identified as
Zambian citizens, according to Zimbabwe officials, and
the war over wildlife has become an issue between the
two governments. Officials from Zimbabwe complain
that Zambia has made inadequate efforts to capture
poachers chased back across the river or to trace the
origins of captured guns. .

Some Zambian legislators have expressed outrage over
the shooting of their countrymen.

“To kill a man for shooting an animal is a very delicate
matter in Africa,” Tatham acknowledged. But he added
that the leaders of both Zimbabwe and Zambia had
publicly supported the policy of shooting armed
poachers.

Dear Connie:
Thank you for your letter regarding S. 1809.

As you know, Senator Dole introduced S. 1809 which, if
enacted, would amend the tariff schedules of the U.S. to repeal
the prohibition against the importation of certain furs from the
Soviet Union. The Finance Committee is now studying this
legislation, and the Subcommittee on International Trade recently
held hearings on S. 1809. I appreciate your sharing your
concerns with me regarding this legislation, and I will remember
your comments if S. 1809 is considered by the full Senate.

It was good to hear from you again, and I hope you will
continue to provide me the benefit of your views on issues of
concern to you.

'ncerely,

Sam Nunn

Made through a grant from the
" United Nations, “Without Bor-
, ders” will be shown in more than
, 100 countries, including the
Soviet Union, China and India.
In the Louisiana segment, Cam-
bre gathers with his family and

friends at a feast of boiled crabs,
crawﬁsh and shrimp in the back-
yard of his home in Norco, then
plies the bayous that often dead-
end at the murky discharge pipes
of huge petrochemical plants.

Some of the most powerful
images in the program were
ﬁlmed by helicopter, focusing in
tightly on foamy industrial dis-
charges, then pulling away to re-
veal wide expanses of cypress
swamp or brackish marsh, while
Cambre talks about the decline in
marsh marine life.

Pyle does not deny that the
piece takes a clear position.

“I’m not afraid to say I’m
against pollution,” she said. “I’m
against cutting down the rain for-
ests. What’s the opposite View?”
The ﬁlm does not include any re-
sponse by corporate or govern-
ment ofﬁcials.

Cambre began ﬁghting for wet-
lands protection in the early
19708, when the state’s Coastal
Zone Management program was
just getting started.

Cambre has been chairman of

the coastal zone program’s Cit- ‘

izen’s Advisory Committee since
it began. The committee must re-
V1ew every proposed ro'ect in
the St. Charles wetland}; Cambre
has been instrumental in ﬁghting
several major development pro-
posals.

‘ “I was called an environ-
mentalist when the term was a
dirty word,” Cambre said. “But
Ive never considered myself ex—
treme one way or the other. All I
was doing was trying to protect
Isomething that has allowed us to
we.

It’s a way of life Cambre grew
up with. Like many people who
have spent their lives in the
marshes, Cambre ticks off the fa-
miliar signs of a sick system: the

lost landmarks as each year a

little more land sinks, the de-
clining ﬁsh catches, the chemical
smells in the bayous.

Cambre continues his weekly
trips into the marsh to sow his
strands of 'grass. He said that
after seeing “Without Borders,”
the job is easier than it used to
be, because he knows that others
are fighting the same fight in

their own ways. A f - _

Yet when he contemplates
Whether the Louisiana bayous
will endure for his grandchildren
to enjoy, Cambre’s eyes mist.

“I can’t be very encouraging,
things are changing much'l‘too
fast,” Cambre said. “But I’m‘not
going to quit. '

“You know, we have beneﬁted
so much from nature’s gifts here
in Louisiana. Yet we. seem’t'o be
the last ones willing to stand up
and object. We should be smarter
than that. We should be a lot
smarter.” "' i"

WASHINGTON —— US. and European ne-

igotiators agreed Saturday to a 75-day cooling-
.off period in the increasingly abrasive trade
rawar involving American beef containing ..

growth hormones.

Carla Hills, holding her ﬁrst discussions as
the Bush administration’s top trade negotia-
tor, said that substantial progress was made

1. in the two days of talks with representatives
'of the 12—nation European Community.

The two sides agreed to establish a task
force to studyingissue“for- .the-99.¥.§-1..5 days

The task force also will consider an Ameri-

FranswAndriessen, the top trade negotiator
for the European Community, said he was en-
couraged by the talks with the new adminis-

tration and predicted “our good will and good
spirit” would lead to a solution.

President Bush and European officials
have expressed a desire to defuse the trade
dispute, fearing that the battle could aggra—
vate tensions while the new administration is
trying to forge closer ties with European
allies.

The dispute began Jan. 1 when the Euro-
peans banned US. beef because the meat
contained hormones used to fatten cattle.

The Reagan administration charged that
the European actidn‘,"‘WHiEHwaffected about
$10,0m.iL1i.9_a_ierp,eaLshimnents annaally, was
an ughrltraﬂdewbarrier”andmthat'thergﬂwuas no
scientiﬁc ”eyidencethat” thehormones were a
healtﬁreat. M

In retaliation, the Americans slapped 100

/ percent tariffs on $100 million worth of Euro—

pean products, ranging from canned tomatoes
to fruit wines and instant coffee. Those tariffs
are just now showing up in higher prices at
US. grocery stores.

The weekend negotiations were an effort to
avoid a counter—retaliatory step threatened by
the Europeans Monday, when the governing
body of the European Community will con-
sider imposing 100 percent tariffs on $100
million of American exports of walnuts and
dried fruit.

Andriessen said he could not speak for the
Europeaff Council ofWMinj-sters but indicated
thamﬁms would likely postpone the sec-
ond round of retaliation.

Andriessen said the United States had indi-
cated it would lower its $100 million in tariffs
by an amount equal to the value gigorgone-
frgegbe‘ef that the United States is able to
ship.

He said consideration would be given to
doubling the quota for high-grade beef. Last
year, the United States shipped $82 million
worth of such beef to Europe. Such a step
would make it more proﬁtable for US. ranch-
ers to raise hormone-free beef.

‘AIDS drug
may not be
effective

37,6 {ff M. b. Ll}.

By]! The Associated Press

 

7(ﬂ16.) r‘, cfrrwv‘é _

LOS ANGELES —— Research
shows a once promising AIDS
drug that has become a popular
underground treatment is
unlikely to be effective against
the killer diseaSe, a report pub-
lished Sunday said.

Oral dextran, believed to be
used by thousands of people
infected with the AIDS virus,
does not appear to be signifi-
cantly absorbed into the blood-
stream, apparently rendering it
. ineffective, the Los Angeles
Times reported.

The preliminary results of gov-
ernment- sponsored studies on
humans and animals have been
known to researchers for more
than a month, DrLFrank Young,
commissioner of‘tﬁe U. S. FoOd
and Drug Administration, sald.

rsaid the decision to keep
the results quiet reflected the
preliminary nature of the data
and his fears that an announce—
ment could dash the hopes of
people taking the drug.

The Japanese- manufactured
drug had been consideredLa
promising experimental therapy
after studies showed the com-
pound could prevent the AIDS
: virus from infecting immune sys—
tem cells in test tubes and inter-
fere with the Virus’ ability to kill
the cells
Young said early ﬁndings that
the drug is not significantly
absorbed into the bloodstream
suggest oral dextran “does not
have the promise of effectiveness
that a lot of people thought and
that we hoped prior to having
this information.”

DIATIDg—n—l—Qi Hoth, director of
the S Program at the Na-
tional Institute of Allergy 51d
InfEctious Diseases, said tlﬁ re-
isults are preliminary and that it

s“theoretically possible” for the
compound to be absorbed over
time. ,

Officials at the institute and
university researchers are hoping
to have better answers for ques-
tions about oral dextran based on
data being reviewed from a six-
month, 60— —patient study of the

‘I don’ t think there is any
great mystery about why there
has been no announcement,”
Hoth said. “We are dealing with
' scientific complexity, and we
want to make sure that everyth-
ing is pulled together before mak-
ing a strong public statement.”

N: about inhumane research

Harahan
‘ Re thekeh\2f er, “Humans
would suffer rom animal re-

search ban,” by members of the

"American Medical Women’s
' Association:

If all research done with ani-

3 mals were as good as they say, if

animals were treated humanely

and if the research provided sta-
tistically reliable results, groups
3 like the Humane Society of the
United States and People for
.Ethical Treatment of Animals
';"would not complain so much.

f”... It has been proven, however,
”that animals have not been

treated in a humane manner in
all research labs. Several’have

been shut down or have had their
funding cut because of inhumane

practices, such as the University

’ of Pennsylvania’s Head Injury
Research Lab.

’ Anesthetics are not always
used. See the videotape, “Unne—
cessary Fuss” available from Peo—
ple for Ethical Treatment of
Animals. The tape was shot by
the researchers themselves of
their own experiments with head
injuries on primates. The animals
were very obviously in severe

‘ pain.

. Laboratories other than medi-
cal also do inhumane research to
test cosmetics and other house—
hold products. Surely we have
enough products on the market
to choose from that no more ani—
mals should have to suffer.

Although the letter—writers say
inspections are periodically per-
formed at many laboratories, the
labs are not necessarily inspected
by those who have animal welfare
in mind.

Other research has proven that

animals are not always the best -

test models. Aspirin can kill cats,
and penicillin can kill guinea
pigs. There is a long list of other
exceptions that you can get from
PETA.

The minimum number of ani—
mals is not always used. Research
is being duplicated in many labo—
ratories around the country.

The fact that we have millions

of animals that have to be de—
stroyed in animal shelters each
year does not give us the right to
subject them to experiments. The
reason we have so many to de-
stroy is that there are too many
people who do not spay or neuter
their pets. Since they are home-
less and many have already suf-
fered loneliness, hunger and
disease, they deserve at least a
humane death at the animal shel—
ter.

And no humane group has ever
suggested that children be used
in research. Animal welfare peo-
ple respect all life, and to even
make such a suggestion is ridicu—
lous. In fact, it was the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals that got the ﬁrst laws
about child protection.

The emotional appeals to law-
makers and the public by hu-
mane organizations are backed
up by statistics and facts. That
some have been indoctrinated by
the medical industry does not
mean that the rest of us have
closed our eyes to injustice.

The medical industry has long
felt itself to be above reproach,
and its research practices are just
beginning to be questioned by
people who are waking up.

' . “I love _,you Cheer!” the cute 3-year-old girl ex-
claimed as she wrapped her arms lovingly around
the neck of the gentle golden retriever.

Cheer, her tail wagging happily, affectionately

dnicapped

 

licked the little girl’s face, which was aglow with pride
at what she had just accomplished. -

Cheer is no ordinary dog. She is specially trained
to work with preschool children who have developmen-
tal problems, and she had just helped the little girl

overcome her fears.

The child had beenasked by her teacher to crawl
through a plastic tunnel as part of a coordination exer- ..

firm

cise

But she was afraid to do
it until the teacher told
herﬂgjlf Cheer can do it,

.Omals— my 1111..

The dog then wriggled
through the tunnel — and
the girl quickly followed
her.

Cheer greeted the girl at
the other end of the tunnel
with a wet kiss, as the girl
hugged the dog’s neck.

Because the aptfl
lynamed dog has "‘
been so successful
at her job, ' the Amer- \\
ican Animal Hospital
Association and the Delta“
.Society -— two national ani-
mal advocacy groups —— have
given Cheer their therapy
‘animal award for 1988.

The amazing animal knows
89 verbal commands, can
turn off the lights in a class-
room on command, and is
trained not to bark so that
she won’t f1 1ghten the chil-
dren.

Cheer’s mistress is Sally
Brockett, who teaches a__

class ﬁof 10 preschoolers,
aged3t05, at the StanleyT.

or coordination.

’ One 4‘year-old physically

handicapped girl had trouble

using her walker in class.
The teacher told the girl.

“Cheer 1s waiting for you on

the other side of the room. ”

The girl used her walker to
slowly cross the room.

“When she reached the
dog she threw her arms
around Cheer’s neck and
hugged and kissed her. ,

f‘I never had a problem
getting her to use her
walker again.”

In a game that encour-

 

 

 

 

 

ages children to learn 001- l
'ors, Brockett calls out the :
name of a color -- for exam- .6
ple, “red.” The child picks

up a red piece of paper and

"hands it to Cheer and the

dog then places the paper in
a pile.

Added Brockett: “There
is no question that Cheer is
helping these youngsters.

“In the one year she has
been part of my classroom,

the children are definitely f

overcoming their develop-
mental problems more rap-
idly.’.’

Department on Monday to re-

the nation’s school- lunch

that won’t put dioxin 1n the milk.

Greenpeace said such cartOns
should be required for the nearly
5 billion half-pints of milk that
five of the department’s pro-
grams help pay for every year.
Eighty percent of that milk is
used 1n school lunches. .

This is 100 times the daily-

by one in a million if continued
for a lifetime. EPA has proposed
a 17- fold reduction in its risk
estimates for dioxin, but has not'

mate were in effect, the 0.6 pi- ,
cograms per kilogram would still
represent six times the amount

Janet Hieber of Greenpeace
said the afﬁnity of dioxin for fat
accounts for ﬁnding it in milk.
“If the carton were ﬁlled with
water instead of milk, chances
are the dioxin would have stayed
in the carton,” she said. "17 ,

when researchers burn, shoot,
shock, irradiate, drug, poison,
bash, infect, mutilate, blind,
deafen, vivisect, killand dissect
the animals?

«“Scientists ' are interested in
treating their animals well for hu-
manitarian reasons and because
the quality of their research data
;often depends on good animal
care.” Do the authors think we
have never heard of the Silver
‘ﬁpring monkeys? Not only were
they, mutilated and abused at the

.Maryland facility where they

were conﬁscated on grounds of

 

 

cruelty, for years they have been
denied asylum at the Texas
sanctuary Primarily Primates,

. where they would be cared for

privately.

“Some groups call for research
on humans — including children
—- in place of laboratory-grown
or unclaimed animals.” This is a
vague statement. What type of
testing? On live humans or ca-
davers?

“We in Louisiana feel our lead-
ers and lawmakers . . . should not
be swayed by the volume of mail
(often just copies)” from animal
rights sympathizers who oppose
animal research. Who’s “we?”

I’m in Louisiana, and they deﬁ- -

nitely do not speak for me.

The copies to which they refer
are mass- -printed postcards and
letters distributed by animal wel-
fare organizations and then
signed, stamped and mailed by
individuals who believe in the
causes stated on the letters. They
are as much an indication of
opinion as a hand- written letter,
and smart elected ofﬁcials will

pay attention to them.
The stand against animal re-

search is based‘ on moral grounds.

Man’s intellectual and physical
capability to enslave and trauma-
tize animals, for whatever pur-

g pose, does not give us the right to

do so. The price of animal re-
search goes beyond the immedi-
ate suffering involved to the
subduction of man’s capacity for
kindness. If we harden our
hearts, if we lose our’ ability to be
merciful Of soul, we destroy the
basis upon which we claim to be
superior to animals in the ﬁrst
place.

Man 15 not made of only ﬂesh
and bone. We must consider
quality of life as well as longevity.
_In this tumultuous wOrld where
we strive to live in peace with our
neighbors and ourselves, the con-
donation of cruelty is a danger-

. ous and contradictory message to

pass along to our children.

Our goal should be to live with
generosity and compassion to—
ward all God’s creatures.

Other alternatives are human
volunteers for testing, and relying
on chemicals already proven safe.
The latter is a route taken by
many companies.

After-Benetton was picketed
by animal rights activists oppos-
ing the use of rabbits in testing
for safety of perfumes, company
president Leslie , Grunberg an-
nounced in November that any
new products introduced by Ben-
etton will not be" tested on ani-
mals. ‘

In the case of skin care and
makeup, Noxell manager of cor-
porate affairs DebbieAlford says,
“There is an enormous data base
to work from” in pulling formu-
lations from ingredients already
known to be safe. Even in the
case of changing. colors of cos-
metics, “the FDA has a vast pal-
ette,” of safe ones, she said.

The new data Noxell hopes to
derive from its method of testing,
she said, “will be shared with the
government, the scientiﬁc com-
munity and the public.”

Noxell’s non-animal screening
test for product safety does not
totally eliminate their use of ani-
mals in product teSting. Alford
says it will reduce by 80 to 90 per

...,_ ....”—

cent the number 'ofanimals
otherwise needed for ocular
safety testing of Noxell cosmet-
ics. The company sees this new
test, she says, as “a critical step
toward the eventual elimination
of the need for animals used in
Noxell’s product safety testing
program.” _. ‘3, ‘

Avon Products has also re-
pOrted a reduction in animal use
for testing,7-stating that its de-
crease was 72 percent between
1981 and 19871

“We’renot satisﬁed until they
are no longer using animals in
testing, butiewe’re happy to hear
they’re moving in the right direc-
tion, and hope their move will en-
courage others to do the Same,”
PETA staffer Susan Rich says.

Because of testing of pro
ranging from household cleaners
to shampoo and personal hygiene

, f,“ ,,

items, animal experimentation
reaches every consumer, say the
approximately ~ 7,000 animal
rights groups in this country.

Last spring an article in Town
& Country magazine put them
into two categories: the reformers
or regulationists,” defined -as
those who “concern themselves
with the mistreatment of ani-
mals, but. do:not advocate vege—

' tarianism orrantiviv'isection” and
“abolutionistsﬂyvhq#‘consider all
of man’s uses 'for animals - in the
laboratory, as food or clothing, or
as exhibits in zoos - to be' unjusti-

ﬁable.”

“Animals are not ours ,to eat,
wear or experiment on,” said Sue
Brebner, outreach coordinator
for People for the Ethical Treat-
ment of Animals (PETA), an na-

iona am u 10 {‘00.
Brebner was in New Orleans last
summer to conduct an awareness
seminar.

The Washington, D.C.-based
organization, which began in .
1981 With‘an unpaid staff of two
and a dozen volunteers, today has

' ' 250,000 members, with last year’s

budget at $3.5 million. ,
The educational organization
received national attention in
1981’when one of its founders,
Alex Pachecgijﬁexposed the mis-
~treatmentbfaiiimals for medical
research by'iﬂﬁvEdward Taub in
his Silver Springs, Md. lab. .
Some of the rescued monkeys
now reside on the North Shore at
the Delta Regional Primate Re-
search Center, associated with
Tulane University Medical Cen-
ter. PETA is still pursuing legal’

channels to take custody of the
remaining nine monkeys,
although scientists have recom-
mended mercy killings for the an-
imals. ‘ . ‘ .1 . .

.Toni Tanner, a local member
of PETA, says shebecame aware
of animal testing‘last year and
immediately "changed cosmetic
brands. .. ‘

“I realized there-was a little bit
of pain and death in each'lipstick
and rouge I usﬁd,;’:’*'said Tanner, a
local bartendejﬁx. ' ,

“.Most of iriy‘customers are in
their early 20s: well-groomed and
in college,” said Suzanne Foster
BourgeOis, a local travel agent
who sells a cruelty-free European

skin-care line for the convenience
of those looking for an option.

“Some of their mothers become
chents as well.” ' ‘

Both iii—ejefferson ,Sdciety f0;

Preventionvof Cruelty to Animals
(SPCA) and the Louisiana SPCA
report an increase in the. number
of calls they get on the subject of
animal testing. "5
“I’ve been doing this for sevefi

calls about these issues, but now
a day never goes by without

said Nita Hemeter of the Jeffer}

ucts.” . ‘ , '
“It’s incredible, the awareness
we’ve seen. But it’s that way with

their ability to ﬁnd homes for the

humane societies all over the
country have special programs
that give children and senior cit-

While some animal lovers seem

to prefer pets to people, most hu- .

human beings. .. _

Scientists testing

By The Associated Press

 

 

NEW YORK — An experi—
mental birth control vaccine
shows promise for blocking preg-
nancy for six months without sig-

nificant side effects, a

preliminary study suggests.

The vaccine stimulated the

immune systems of women vol- .

unteers to disrupt the action of a
key hormone needed for preg-
nancy, researchers said.

The vaccine’s effectiveness
could not be tested directly be—
cause the women had been surgi-
cally sterilized. But the immune
system reactipn appeared to be
strong enough to work, research—
ers said.

The study is described in Sa-
turday’s issue of The'Lancet, a
British medical journal, by scien—
tists from Australia, the World
Health Organization in Geneva,
Switzerland, and Ohio State Uni-
versity in Columbus.

Scientists in several labo-
ratories have been developing
long—lasting contraceptive treat-
ments. Some inject tiny~ spheres
that release a drug at a controlled
rate, providing contraception for
up to six months.

Several governments have
approved use of match-stick
sized capsules that are implanted
just under the skin of a woman’s
arm under Ideal anesthetic. By
slowly releasing a drug, they pro-
vide contraception for ﬁve years
unless removed sooner.

Several groups are studying
vaccines similar to the one used
in the new study, said Gabriel

vac cine

Bialy, chief of the contraceptive .
development branch of the Na-
tional Institute of Child Health
and Human Development.

_ ,A variety of strategies is-
needed to allow choices in birth

icontrol, Bialy said.

The vaccine was designed to
spur the immune system into
making proteins, called anti-
bodies, that block the action of a
hormone called human chorionic
gonadotropin, produced during

pregnancy.

AWown that
an anti 0 ' attack 0 is hor-
mone can halt a pregnancy at an

early stage, researchers said.
M

Scientists are not sure whether
the attack prevents the blast—
ocyst, a clump of cells that grows
from a fertilized egg, from
implanting itself in the uterus
wall, or whether it prevents fur-
ther development soon after
implantation, Bialy said.

Implantation normally takes
place six or seven days after the
egg is fertilized.

The study included 30 women,

" 26 to 43. Twenty received one of

ﬁve doses. of the vaccine and the
rest a fake injection. Each re-
ceived two injections, sixweeks
apart. They were studied for six
months after the ﬁrst injection. ~ -

All vaccinated women showed
antibody levels that apparently
would be high enough to block
pregnancy, researchers said.

No participants showed any
serious side effects, researchers
said. Several had mild and tem—
porary muscle pain within two
days of the injection.

'BOSTON — To anyone who

Dr. Susan Winders, a re-

Dr. Robert C. Klesges of
Memphis State University re-
viewed the data from 70 of the
most recent of these reports.
Together, they suggest that
smokers weigh an average of
seven pounds less than non-
smokers. And when people give
up smoking, they gain an average
of six pounds.

Klesges said he could ﬁnd no

Some research also hints that

proven conclusively.

“It may be that both dietary
intake and metabolic rate are
involved, probably in complex
ways,” Klesges said.

showed that people giving up cig-

SAN DIEGO—Those on the
front lines of the war against wild-
life extinction were basking in
' some rare glory last- week.

“It’s been a great couple of weeks
for the captive breeders,” said
Larry Killmar, curator of mammals
at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park. .

Two weeks ago, Molloko, the
ﬁrst California condor conceived in
captivity, was hatched at the park,
creating a global media sensation.
A number of other rare successes,
however, received much less atten-
tion, because they happened about
the same time, Killmar said.

Last Tuesday, for example,
Becky, a black-footed ferret and
one of only 26 members of that
ﬁerce species still alive, gave birth
to two tiny pups in a captive
breeding center in Sybille, Wyo.

“We have strong indications that
another 15 female ferrets are im-
pregnated,” said Sharon Rose, a
spokeswoman for the US Fish
and Wildlife Service in Denver,
which oversees the ferret project.
“We’re expecting a baby boom any
day now.”

Four years ago, there were only
six black-footed ferrets in existence,
All were captured by Wyoming
game ofﬁcials for captive breeding,
in an effort to stave off extinction.

Another victory came two weeks
ago when Dr. Thomas Cade’s team
at the Peregrine Fund in Boise,
Idaho, assisted in the hatchin of
two rare Mauritius kestrels rom
captive parents. It was the ﬁrst
time these African birds of prey
have been mated in the Americas.

Bill Heinrich, Cade’s associate,
said in a telephone interview that
the group’s other project, raising
and releasing threatened peregrine
falcons, will result in almost 300
birds bred in captivity being set
free in 18 states this year.

To their delight, scientists at the
privately operated Peregrine Fund
project discovered that the falcons
can be introduced into big cities,

where they feed on pigeons and,

other urban game and use tall
buildings the way their ancestors
used cliffs.

Wild breeding pairs of peregrines
now live in Chicago, Milwaukee,
Salt Lake City and Denver. On
May 2, ornithologists discovered
two chicks, the ﬁrst to be hatched
in Illinois since 1951, on a 34th-
ﬂoor ledge of a downtown Chicago
office building.

California condors may be mak-
ing the headlines lately, but they
have a long way to go before they
catch up with the peregrines. Even
black-footed ferrets will outnumber
condors if the predicted Wyoming
baby boom really happens.

Molloko’s birth raises the condor
roll call to a precarious 28. All the
nation’s condors are in captivity
after breeders defeated environmen-
talists in federal courts in Califor-
nia and won permission to trap the
last birds in the wild in 1986 and
1987.

Critics of captive breeding, such
as David Phillips of the Earth
Island Institute in San Francisco,
warn that once animals are re-
moved from a habitat, there are
enormous pressures to alter that
habitat. Therefore, he said, reintro-
ducing the birds into nature is un-
likely, even if scientists can get the
wild creatures to mate in cages—a
difﬁcult feat in itself.

It took bird experts at the San
Diego park six years to get “captive
condors to breed. And though con-
dors may currently be the best
known, they are only one species
among more than 40 in the captive
breeding program.

The wild animal park, which oc-
cupies almost 2,000 acres, is a
modern day Noah’s Ark for en—
dangered species, at the forefront
of this country’s breeding effort.
Other creatures in its breeding pro-
gram include the Arabian oryx,
Przewalski’s wild horse, Sumatran
tiger, South African cheetah,
maned wolf, Persian onager, Trans—
caspian kulan, Somali wild ass,
lowland tapir and three species of
rhinoceros—the East African black,

CAMBRIDGE, Md. (AP)—
Ten bald eagles have died in the
last two months, apparently be-
cause they ate the carcasses of
animals that had been poisoned
illegally, federal ofﬁcials said.

“While our national symbol is
making a recover , it cannot
sustain this rate 0 loss month
after month, nor will we tolerate
it,” said Frank Dunkle, director of
the US. Fish and Wildlife Service.

Penalties for harming or killing
a bald eagle, protected under fed-
eral law, range from one to ﬁve
years in jail and ﬁnes of $5,000
to, $100,000.

 

Eagle deaths blamed on poisoned carcasses

State and federal ofﬁcials are
particularly concerned because
Dorchester County, where the
eagles died, has the greatest con-
centration of eagles in the
Chesapeake Bay area. Of 94 ac—‘
tive bald eagle nests in Maryland,
22 are in Dorchester County.

The most recent discovery, ﬁve

,dead eagles, was May 3. Five

others were found in various
locations from March 12 to May
1. Tissue from the dead eagles. as,
well as the carcasses are being
tested for chemicals. Results are
expected in several weeks.

 

the Great Indian and the Northern

white.

The Northern white rhino is a
male, Killmar said, and negotia-
tions are underway to bring the an-
imal into contact with two females
kept in a Yugoslavian 200.

The park, afﬁliated with the San
Diego 200, was established 16
years ago when the zoo found itself
unable to maintain its world-fa-
mousicollections because many
creatures were dying—often be-
cause of worsening conditions in
their habitats.

“You can’t send a. collector into
a war zone,” Killmar said. “You

don’t have much luck telling star—
ving people in the Third World
that they shouldn’t eat a particular
animal because it’s rare. And you
absolutely can’t trap an animal
once its species is extinct.”

- Despite the critics’ reservations,
he argued, the captive breeding
program has achieved some suc—
cesses-

He said the park’s biggest suc—
cesses so far have been with the
Arabian oryx, a species of antelope,
and with the Przewalski’s wild
horse, an extremely rare horse na-
tive to the area along the Chinese
Mongolian border.

Student gets probation
for killing of show lambs

By Janet Elliott
OF THE HOUSTON POST

 

Stacey Wolf was 10 days away
from taking what she hoped
would be a blue ribbon at the
Humble Livestock Show when
her lamb, Copi, was killed.

But despite her dashed high
hopes, Wolf says she harbors no
ill will toward the 17-year-old
student who Wednesday formal-
ly admitted responsibility for
slaying Wolf’s animal and anoth-
er Kingwood High School stu-
dent’s lamb. '

Wolf, 15, was on hand in state
District Judge Bob Burdette’s
court Wednesday to see Jason
Everett Gentry sentenced to
three years on probation for
criminal mischief.

Gentry, a junior at New Caney ‘

High School, also was ordered to
perform 160 hours of communi-
ty service and to pay restitution
of $1,300 to each student.

“I think he’s real sorry for
what he did,” Wolf said.

She said Gentry was drunk
_ and shot the two lambs with a

rifle “on a dare” from friends

riVed at the school’s agriculture
barn to find Copi dead.

“I was real shocked,” said Sta-
cey Wolf. “I wasn’t expecting
anything like that.”

“Just the night before we had
been taking pictures of him,”
Linda Wolf recalled.

For five months, Wolf and her
mother had been awakening at
5:30 am. to feed Copi before
school. After school, Stacey Wolf
would groom and exercise the 1-
year-old ewe.

Others in the Kingwood com-
munity were outraged at the vio-
lence. A $2,000 reward was
posted by Kingwood High
School’s booster club, the King-
wood Civic Center and relatives
of Heather Hill, the other student
whose lamb was killed.

A few weeks later, Gentry sur-
rendered to police. The youth’s
attitude and the remorse he has
shown has helped the Wolfs deal
with the crime, they said.

“I feel he’s very sorry,” Linda
Wolf said. "He c0uldn’t even
look us in the eye in court.”

Although Copi was destined
for the slaughterhouse, Stacey
said she had grown attached to

w Wolf and her mother, Linda W
Wolf, remembered the pain they
felt that morning when they ar-

the lamb and did not like the
way she was killed. '

“I don’t want this to happen to
anyone else,” she said.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE — May 10, 1988

Whale loBe Bur’etI a! Sea

By Paul Liberatore
Chronicle Stan“ Writer

In the long history of the Port of San
Francisco, there never was a problem
quite as large as this one.

. How do you get rid of the bloated body of
.i a 40foot, 32-ton gray whale stuck under a city
pier?

YOu can’t just wrap the thing up in news-
' paper and toss it in the garbage.

: “It‘s a different kind of problem than
ri’we’re used to,” said port spokesman Charlie
I’Mitchell.

After three days of indecision over who is
responsible for the disposal of dead whales,
port officials finally took action yesterday.

. It was none too soon for Ray Deiter, a
j‘Sausalito veterinarian who has been watching
‘over the swelling carcass of the full-grown,

“ female whale since it was found wedged under
,Pier 70 on Saturday.

“I spent 48 hours trying to get things go-
ing,” Deiter said. “Normally, the National Ma-
rine Fisheries handle whales. But when they
roll in dead, it’s an open question.”

The port won the honor by default. The
increasingly smelly whale was filling with gas
and threatening to explode. Someone had to do
something quick.

Divers sawed away some pier pilings early
yesterday afternoon and a port tugboat, the
Frank G. White, threw a line around the whale
and pulled its scarred body loose from the pier.

Waterfront workers and reporters watch-
ed in amazement as the tug dragged its unusuo
al cargo to Pier 94, where the dead whale

would remain until arrangements could be -

made to have it towed out to sea and sunk.

Late yesterday afternoon, the port an-
nounced that it had hired a private company,
Westar at Pier 46, to do the job with an ocean-
going tug. The whale is scheduled to be drag-
ged outside the Golden Gate today and sent to

:a watery grave.

Deiter said workers would either sink the
whale by punching holes in its body or by
blowing it to pieces with explosives.

it. would be an ignoble end for a creature
of a species believed to be one of the most
intelligent on earth. After examining the body.
Dieter concluded yesterday that the whale was
killed by a harpoon that shattered its skull and
punctured its brain.

He found rusty metal fragments in the
wound. indicating that the animal may have
been harpooned as long as two weeks ago.
Dieter said the whale apparently broke free
when the whalers wrapped a line around its
body and tried to winch it into their ship.

The suffering whale swam around, losing
massive amounts of blood, until it wandered
into the bay and went under the pier to die.

Dieter blamed the killing on “pirates” who
illegally harpoon whales in the open seas.

The pirates are from the countries that

 

a RINGMAN/EWLHRONICE
A Port of San Francisco tug towed the dead whale out from under Pier 70

still condone whaling —— Japan. the Soviet
Union. Norway and Iceland, Deiter said.

“There are pirate ships around who do this
stuff,” Dieter said, shaking his head with dis-

gust. “A harpoon through the brain is a terri-
ble way to die."

 




TAMPA TRIBUNE - May 11, 1988

* Protect Big Cypress

‘ he National Parks Service, over-
. seeing more than 79 million
acres, confronts an assortment of dan-
gers, from angry grizzly bears to ruth-
less marijuana growers. But the Park
Service’s greatest threat is armed
with neither fang nor riﬂe.

Political appointees are making a
mockery of the national lands so trea-
sured by the American public. (There

are close to 300 million park visits a ‘

year)

Tribune reporter Booth Gunter’s
recent stories about oil exploration in
the Big Cypress National Preserve
emphasize the point.

Assistant Interior Secretary Wil-
liam Horn approved Shell Western
E&P Inc.’s request to conduct seismic
testing in the Big Cypress, though
Park Service experts wanted an envi-
ronmental study completed before
testing was permitted.

Horn dismissed worries that setting
off the explosive charges might dam-
age this important South Florida wa-
ter system. Horn, assistant secretary
of fish, wildlife and parks, is a Reagan
appointee who has consistently sided
with those seeking to exploit national
lands.

Interior rescinded Horn’s decision
last weekend, apparently recognizing
it could not withstand much scrutiny.
Environmentalists had filed a legal
challenge to Horn’s approval, accu-
rately claiming the potential impact
'of the testing was not properly evalu-
ated. That it took a lawsuit to make
Interior act responsibly indicates its
decision-making process is flawed.

Shell representatives say they can

conduct seismic testing and even oil
drilling without harming the Big Cy-
press, and perhaps they can. But im-
portant resources such as Big Cypress
merit greater protection than Horn’s
faith in the petroleum industry.

Horn rejected the Park Service
recommendation that a comprehen-
sive environmental impact study be
conducted to detail the potential ef-
fects of oil exploration and drilling on
water quality and wildlife. Consider-
ing that the Big Cypress is a vital wa-
ter source for the Everglades and is
inhabited by many endangered spe-
cies, including the Florida panther,
such caution is prudent.

And though Interior has retreated,
for now, from Horn’s stand, it’s still
appalling that an appointee such as
Horn can arbitrarily overrule Park
Service experts, including director
William Penn Mott. That underscores
the need to keep politics out of park
decisions.

Congressman Bruce Vento, a Min-
nesota Democrat, has proposed legis-
lation to make the Park Service
politically independent of the Interior
Department. His plan would have the
president appoint the Park Service di-
rector for a five-year term and have a
three-member review board responsi-
ble to Congress oversee park opera-
tions.

Vento’s effort to depoliticize park
decisions deserves consideration.
We’re not sure a complete reorganiza-
tion is necessary. But it’s evident cav-
alier Interior officials such as Horn
need reminding that their duty is to
protect — not sell out — the Ameri-
can public’s lands.

Gentlemen:

You know, I really don't like to keep bothering you, and having to
‘write letter after letter because of the greed or incompetence of
some members of our government, but I guess this Will always be true.

As I wrote you last week re the report released showing that damage
had indeed been done to wildlife and the environment by the drilling
for oil in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska.

NOw we have the Assistant Interior Secretary William Horn approving
Shell western ESP Inc.'s request to conduct seismic testing in the
Big Cypress, even though Park Service e§perts (is this Horn an ex-
pert on anything?) wanted an environmental study completed.before
testing was permitted.

Reagan seems to have had a real talent for appointing people who don't
_ giVe a darn about the environment or our National Parks and Refuges.
Thank.God.his term is almost over, and unless the other candidates show
some concern for our national treasures, I think they are going to

have a very rough time indeed.

Even though Interior has retreated from this proposal, I must agree
with the editorial in the Tampa Tribune that it is indeed appalling
that an appointee such as HOrn, can arbitrarily overrule Park Service
experts, including William P. Mott. Politics must be kept out of
park decisions and Refuge decisions.

Congressman Bruce vento's proposed legislation to make the Park Service
pOlitically independent of the Interior Department might be a good idea
after all. It is certainly worth consideration and should take care of
any more hairbrained ideas like Horn's. Give it some thought, please.

Sincerely,

Gentlemen:

I am sure you gentlemen know and understand that the Animal Rights
MOvement in America is in its infancy - and as the saying goes -
"you ain't seen.nuthin' yet”.

Nbst people are sick and tired of the way animals have been misused,
tortured, and mistreated in the research laboratories around the
country. They are determined that something is going to be done to
improve the living conditions of these animals. we have an Animal
welfare Act enacted.in 1985, but we need to have issued the regulae
tions under the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments
to the Animal Welfare Act.

 

Personally, I am just as sick and tired of the pussyfooting around
being done by and in Congress, which appear to be an effort to dis-
regard these amendments and this Act. But it is not going to hap-
pen, and these delaying actions only cause people to become more
riled until they take matters into their own hands.

I am asking you to please call Secretary Lyng and strongly urge
the he issue regulations NOW!!! Please remind the Secretary that
well- -prepared proposed regulations, written by Agriculture' 5 ex-
perienced humane veterinarian Dr. R. L. Crawford, appeared in the
Federal Register Mbrch 31,1987 for Parts I and II. These should
be published as FINAL REGULATTENS'without further foot—dragging or
weakening.

 

I understand that proposed regulations for Part III have been writ—
ten but not released. They too, should be published so the con-
cerned public can read them and make comments about them before
they are made final.

As a concerned member of the public - for whom government em:
ployees supposedly work — I insist on maintaining straightfor-
ward regulatory action to halt abuse and neglect of these
animals until other means are found to carry on research.

 




-2-

There must be honest enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act, and
I am against removing this enforcement from.Veterinary Services
and placing it in a new entity to be called Compliance and Ani-
mal welfare.

Congress passed an excellent piece of legislation in the Improved
Standards for Laboratory Animals amendments, but these regulations
MUST BE FINALIZED AND FULL SUPPORT GIVEN TO THE VETERINARY
INSPECTORS.

I urge you all to see that this is done without fUrther ado.

Please let me hear from you on this top priority matter with me.

Sincerely,

GMrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Gentlemen:

Let's get S. 675 on the floor for a vote. Congress has
wasted enough time on this Bill. The House passed it
overwhelmingly, and I hope the Senate will do the same.

In View Of the massacre of the dolphins recently reported,
and the reports of all the killing of sea life with the
nets which stretch for so many miles and go down to many
feet, I think it is past time when we stopped.this whole-
sale slaughter of our creatures in the ocean simply to
satisfy the greed of the fishermen.

Of course, it is the fishermen who are causing this de-
struction, and it has to be stopped - one way or the
other.

I understand the Senate has delayed action on this bill
for the past three years. ‘we have had enough foot-drag-
_ging, and.it is time to get this Bill in the works.

Please let me hear from you as to what you are going to do
about S. 675.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. Verity:

This letter is in support of the designation of the Cordell Bank
sanctuary with the Gulf of the Farallones sanctuary, and with a
prohibition on oil and gas drilling.

The latest report from.the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service is
proof enough of the damage which has been done by the drilling
fOr oil in the Prudhoe Bay oilfield. Conservationists were duly
concerned about this before it happened, and now it seems they
were right.

Let us not repeat our past mistakes, and let us protect our
natural resources and.our wildlife while we still can.

I understand that the Flower Garden Banks Sanctuary Proposal has

been batted about for ten years. I urge you to expedite consider—
ation of this site.

A.copy of this letter is going to my two Senators and Congressman
urging that they support reauthorization of Title III of the

Gentlemen:
Two more matters of great concern to me ------

H.R. 2883, sponsored by Robert Smith of NH, would direct the transfer of
the Silver Spring monkeys from their incarceration at the Delta Regional
Primate Research Center. These animals have suffered enough, and I know
that a lot of members of Congress signed a petition which went to the
NIH to have these unfortunate animals sent to Primarily Primates in Texas
where they would receive the care and freedom they deserve.

Please sponsor this Bill, Pat, and when it goes to the Senate (or if it
is already there), please co-sponsor suCh a Bill, Sam and wyche.

we have been told time and time again by researchers, that primates are
the nearest creature to man, and yet we continue to torture them and
misuse them.in the name of science, or in.the "hope" it might help a
human. we know the real reason is because of the tax dollars given to
these researChers whose actions bear a lot of watching and investigating.

And .there is H.R. 2859, the veal Calf Protection Act, introduced by

Rep. Charles E. Bennett of Florida. I know you gentlemen have seen pic-
tures of these animals in small crates where it is almost impossible for
them to stand. The fact that they are slaughtered soon after birth is no
reason to restrict them.in such a manner, causing them untold suffering.
And.imagine the suffering the mother cow goes thru when her calf is taken
away from her almost at birth. ‘We have So much to account for in our treat-
.ment of animals. I donlt know how some of these researchers and farmers are
able to sleep at night.

Please, Pat, co-sponsor this H.R. 2859 and get it passed. And Sam and
Wyche, if such a Bill is not presently in the Senate, please sponsor one.

One more I overlooked - H.R. 3233, Non—Agricultural Farm.Animal Protec-
tion Act of 1987 introduced.by Edolphus Towns of NY. I understand this
Bill will amend the Animal Welfare Act to insure that all_warm'blooded

 




-2-

animals in non-agricultural research, zoos, and circuses are covered under
this law which specifies minimum standards of care. I thought this was
in the original Animal welfare Act, but apparently it was not.

Since we obviously cannot trust humans to treat animals with compassion,
we must have laws to see that they do, and most important, we must have
peOple to inspect the premises where these animals are kept to see that
they are treated humanely.

Again, Sam.and.Wyche, I trust you will introduce similar legislation in
the Senate and work for its passage.

Please let me hear from you on these three Bills.
Thanks.

I ‘ Destruction of birds’
nest site stirs outrage

By Thomas]. Meyer
and Joseph Garcia

Staff Writers

Dallas environmentalists de-
nounced the bulldozing on Mon-
day of trees containing the nests of
endangered snowy egrets at the
University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas.

A construction company Mon-
day afternoon cleared out about 25
trees to make room for tennis
courts, Southwestern officials said.

Environmentalists and nearby
residents said the grove has long
been known as a nesting area for
the migratory birds, which are in
the middle of their nesting period.

“This is an outrageous act,” said
" Campbell Read, vice president for
: conservation of the Audubon Soci-
-; ety of Dallas County. “It hasn’t
been matched by anything in the
' city in the recent past.”

said Monday night that university
officials were investigating the in-
cident, but would not comment
further.

“We’re looking into it,” said Ka-
thy Costello, the spokeswoman.
“We’re concerned about it as well.”

Ms. Costello said she did not
know how many tennis courts
were planned or whether contrac-
tors had been told to save the
trees.

In the early evening, about 100
large white birds flew around a
cluster of remaining trees, search-
ing for places to perch. Several
nests remained in the razed trees.

“When you take their space
away, you create havoc in their
life cycle,” said Chris Gullion, a
Southwestern assistant professor
and member of the Audubon Soci-
ety.

WASHINGTON — Oil develop-

The unreleased report, whose.

findings are the subject of dispute

Among the report’s findings are
that 11,000 acres of vegetation used
by wildlife at Prudhoe Bay have
been lost, almost double what was
predicted, and that most bird spe-
cies in the area have declined in
population, as have bears, wolves
and other predators.

The report cites inadequate

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - May 12, 1988

Snow Job 0n Prudhoe Bay

As Congress debates the administration’s
plan to permit oil drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), it is im-
perative that the administration be candid
in disclosing all information it has on the
environmental effects of existing nearby
oil operations at Prudhoe Bay. According
to The New York Times, however, a Fish
and Wildlife Service report on the damage
at Prudhoe Bay has been suppressed.
Though the report Was made at the behest
of Congress, the lawmakers have not been
allowed to see it.

This'isn’t the first time'that the Reagan
administration has tried to fudge the facts
on ANWR drilling. The initial Interior De-
partment staff assessment of the environ-
mental consequences of opening this wil-
derness area to oil exploration was
evidently more negative than Secretary
Donald ,Hodel had wanted; the final report

simply omitted the pesSimistic forecasts.

Increasingly, independent agencies and ,
private environmental groups are giving :

the lie to claims by the petroleum industry

' and the Reagan «administration that oil in-

stallations on Alaska’s North Slope are en!

vironmentally benign — or, as Vice Presi-
dent George Bush claims with respect to
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, even beloved
by some species.

The Fish and Wildlife Service’s report
confirms the independent studies. More
than 20,000 birds have been deprived of
their habitat, it found, resulting in popula-

tion declines for most bird species. Porcu- :

pine caribou have increased, but that is
owing to the hunting of wolves, bears and
other predators. All other large mammals
have declined, too. The quality and quanti-
ty offreshwater supplies have been dam—

aged more frequently and more severely

HOUSTON POST - April 30, 1988

TaXIdermlst 1n Dayton
tlcketed for lion hunts

’1
By Harold Scarlett

 

~POST ENVIRONMENT WRITER .

 

Government investigators issued
three tickets Friday to a Dayton
taxidermist after an investigation of
African lion hunts that strayed onto
government property purchased
for the Wallisville Reservoir proj-
ect.

An Army Corps of Engineers
spokesman, Ed White, said the lion
huntmaster, Larry Wilburn, 30, was
ticketed by the corps for disposing
of animal carcasses on government
land, which carries a $50 fine, and
for conducting a business for profit
on federal property, which carries a
$75 fine.

in addition, White said, Wilburn
was ticketed by a US. Fish and

Wildlife Service enforcement agent ‘

for not havin a license to mount
migratory wa erfowl. The violation
carries a $110 fine.
,. White said the third ticket, not
*ﬂirectly related to the lion hunting,
was issued when corps ranger
.iICharles Craddock and the uniden-
jtified wildlife agent visited Wilburn
in his taxidermy shop Friday after-
noon. ‘

“Wilburn could either pay the
fines or contest the charges before
a federal magistrate,” White said.

“He told Mr. Craddock he would
pay the fines and was not going to
hunt any more lions on govern-
ment land.”

Reports of lion hunts being
staged in the coastal marshlands
near the mouth of the Trinity River
were confirmed when two lion car-
casses, skinned and beheaded,
were found two weeks ago on gov-
ernment property. The remains of
half a dozen goats, apparently used
as bait to draw the lions, also were
found on government land.

Wilburn removed the animal
carcasses last week at the govern-
ment’s request.

Government investigators said
he staged the lion hunts for fees of
$2,500 to $3,500 for trophy hunt-
ers who didn’t have the time or
desire to goto Africa.

Six to nine lions, reportedly old,
half—tame animals that had mostly
been purchased from zoos, were
said to have been killed over sever-
al weeks of hunts.

The killing of the half-tame lions
was condemned by 200 and hu~
mane society officials and state and
federal wildlife officers. But the
wildlife officers said there were no

state or federal laws specificallyi
prohibiting the killing of African li-l

ons.

Dolphin death studyii:
getting more money

that perished along Florida’s coast

PHOENIX GAZETTE - May 11, 1988

 

 

The Associated Press

FERNANDINA BEACH — A
money-starved project to study
mass dolphin deaths along the East
Coast has received a boost from the
Navy and the National Marine
Fisheries Service.

The Office of Naval Research
has handed over $50,000 for the dol-
phin study, and Tom McIntyre of
the fisheries service said his agen-
cy soon will chip in another
$50,000.

“The animals are still dying. The
Navy felt it was appropriate that
the investigation continue. They
did a review of his proposal and it
was accepted. We are in the pro-
cess of moving our money,” McIn-
tyre said on Friday.

The beneficiary is the task force
headed by Canadian researcher Dr.
Joseph Geraci, who has anxiously
awaited more money since the
study’s money ran out earlier this
year.

Marine fisheries officials had
said two months ago that because
of financial shortfalls no .further
, research was being done and the
study might be doomed.

Among the research are studies

He was asked by the US. govern-
ment to head the research began,
last July when hundreds of dead
dblphins began washing ashore in,
New Jersey and Virginia. The
deaths spread down the coast,
reaching Florida in November. L

Fisheries service statistics put
the official dolphin death toll from
New Jersey to Florida at 742, but
the actual number is probably
much higher than that because
mammals that didn’t wash ashore
couldn’t be counted. - ._

“One thing we can be certain of
is that more animals died than we
counted,” said fisheries service
spokesman Brian Gorman.

The cause of deaths is unknown,
although scientists think something
is sapping the dolphins’ immune
systems, leaving them to languish
and die from a host of common in-
fections. --

Canada K1A 0E6

Dear Mr. Siddon:

Just when I thought it was okay to re-vist Canada I learn that
Canada has approved the killing of 50,000-60,000 month old seal
pups so they can be turned into furs, fox feed and aphrodisiacs.

This is sickening and revolting to me. I thought Canada had
joined the modern world and was finally going to protect its
wildlife. Seems like I was misinformed.

Of course, to me, an individual has to be real sick to kill an
animal any place so that its skin can be turned into a coat for
a human, or its body fed.to an animal being raised so it can in
turn be slaughtered for its fur. '

we live in a sick world - that I know - which is only too evi—
dent in the way we treat our fellow humans. But they at least
do have organizations fighting for them, and too few fighting
for the rights of animals. '

In reading the entire article in.Anhmals'.Agenda for June, it was
really disgusting to read.how these small animals are being killed
and how their bodies are going to be used. I guess what our world
really needs is a good education on the value of our creatures and
the fact that they have a right to exist because they were created
by God,.not because they have to serve a human.

Surely the Canadian economy is not in such a state that you have to

First, please write to Canada’s
Fisheries Minister, Mr. Tom Siddon.
Let him know exactly how you feel
about Canadian fishermen killing
50,000 to 60,000 month'old seal pups

SAN FRANCISCO

A Protest

By Ken Castle
Chronicle Outdoors Editor
Sacramento

A coalition of animal rights
organizations, outraged by the

recent killing of a black bear .1

that became a town nuisance in
Cloverdale, yesterday protested
the “inhumane” wildlife poli-
cies of the California Depart-
ment of Fish and Game. '

On another issue, the‘ state an-
ditor general's officejssued a report
criticizing the department for al-
lowing ranchers to establish private
hunting preserves in which deer —
including lawns —- can be killed
butside public seasons. The six-
month investigation said there was
no evidence that the program was
meeting its goal of preserving wild
life habitat.

'. About a dozen members of Call-
‘ ijornians for Responsible Animal

ﬂanagement marched around the
steps of the Capitol building with

' {signs lambasting the department

Over Killing of Cleverdole Bear

and its director, Pete Bontadelli.
They blamed him for the death of
the lea-pound female black bear
and for a host of other problems
dealing with animal welfare.

Pat Derby, founder of the Per-
forming Animﬂ Welfare Society
JPAWS), said members of her group
had offered to house the bear with-
out charge to the state but the de-
partment turned down the offer.

“Killing the hear was arbitrary
and senseless,” she said. “We want-
ed to take care of it, but the depart-
ment told us that our place was not
good enough and that our services
were not needed."

Derby has been battling the de
partment for more than a year over
renewal of her shelter permit. The
department contends that her cages
do not meet regulations.

Bearing placards that read
“Clean Up Fishy Game -- Bump
Bontadelli.” the protesters visited
offices of state senators demanding
that. he be rejected as permanent

confirmation hearings are held
June 22. \

They also are calling for inves-
tigations by the attorney general
and the auditor general of the de-
partment‘s policies on captive wild-
life, particularly relating to trainers
who work in the film industry.

Derby said conflicts of interest
among department administrators
have resulted in virtually no inspec-
tions of these compounds in recent
years -'-— despite problems in hous
ing and feeding turned up by feder-
al inspectors.

The Chronicle reported last
week that Captain ,James Zobel,
who has been in charge of captive
animal permits for the past 11 years,
was negotiating with a group of
commercial animal handlers to be
come their paid consultant after he
retires from the department.

The state auditor general’ s re
port on the department's controver-
sial “Ranch for Wildlife" program,

which sets up private hunting pre-.

 

l

serves outside of regular seasons,
said the program has major short~
comings. Among them:

I The program involves 54

landowners with 694,000 acres but ,

“no guarantee exists that this habi-
tat Will be protected in the future

because landholders may voluntari- .

ly withdraw from the program at
any time.” In fact, four ranches al-
ready have dropped out of the pro-
gram.

I The department did not al-
ways document its visits to these
properties to determine whether
the landholders were making prom-
ised improvements to the habitat.

I Investigators could not docu-
ment significant benefits either to
the deer population or to the hunt-
ing community.

Lieutenant Governor Leo Mc-
Carthy, whose criticism of the pro-
gram spurred the audit, said the
report confirms his fears that the
program is “outdoor recreation for
the privileged in the guise of con-
servation."

Dear Ms. Allen:

Further to my recent letters re Dr. White's article in
your April issue.

If you want to be perfectly honest, and on the square
about this.matter of vivisection, you will certainly
see that the other side of the story is printed.

Dr. Nﬁchael Fox, Veterinarian, has doctoral degrees in
‘medicine and animal behavior, is Vice President/Farm
Animals and Bioethics of The Humane Society of the United
States, and the author of a syndicated newspaper column

and nearly 30 books.

It seems to me he is imminemtly well qualified to do a
rebuttal on Dr. White's article. I hope Reader's Digest
will agree, and contact Dr.Fox. I am sure he would be
‘more than.willing to see that the other side is well
presented. '

It seems to me I have read several times that those in-
dividuals engaged in research on animals, are generally
those who have failed to Hake the grade as doctors.
This.may or may not be true, but it is something to think
about, isn't it?

Sincerely,

CMrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

therefore, a Copy of this letter is going to the HOnorable Willie Brown, and
the Honorable David.A. Roberti. I sincerely hope they will appreciate this

It is.my earnest hope that you, and.the two gentlemen.mentioned above, will

' SUPPORT enactment of.AB 4500 sponsored.by Assemblyman Parr. It is my under-
standing this bill would help puppies in pet stores. .AB 4500 would prohibit
the importation of any dog under the age of 12 weeks into the state of Cali—
fbrnia for commercial purposes. Such a prohibition.would severely restrict
puppy mills (which really should.be out out of their dirty, obscene business),
in the interstate shipment of diseased and ill dogs.

The costs of treating sick puppies and providing proper prophylactic treat—
ment for internal parasites and vaccinations against diesease would now be
the burden of the puppy mills and not fall on the unsuspecting and.vulner-
able consumer. These cost factors could well ferce the slipshod breeders out
of business and eliminate many substandard and cruel commercial breeding
establishments;. If you have never seen pictures of these filthy puppy mills
in Kansas, you might well have your aide get you information on same.

I am sorry to read that CalifOrnia has a national reputation for cruelty in
its pet stores. The sale of ill puppies has been exposed extensively in the
media, including the NBC Nightly News. The animal rights movement is just in
its infancy, Governor, and I hope Califbrnia will join the ranks to see that
all life is treated in a humane manner.

Ybur Assemblyman is to be thanked and praised for introducing suCh a Bill
Which would.he1p to make California a leading role in setting a precedent

A SEA OF GALAMI'I'IES

Monoﬁlament gill nets don ’t just catch ﬁsh; they damage marine life in an alarming way

K.

 

BY CLIVE GAMMON

HE QUALITY OF THE VIDEOTAPE IS
poor. but the evidence is there.
Out of the scratchy grayness
and into focus comes a section
of a commercial ﬁshing net, en-
tangled in rocks on the seabed 200 feet
beneath the surface of the Gulf of
Maine. The camera—which is mounted
on a four-man submarine being con—
trolled by Arnold Carr. a biologist with
the Division of Marine Fisheries for the
State of Massachusetts—slowly tracks
along the length of the net. At ﬁrst one
sees nothing unusual on the monitor,
just some seaweed growing on the net.
On the tapes audio track Carr notes
that the vegetation is Spiro botinz’a.
Then. suddenly, the lens picks up a
white object grotesquely twisted in the
mesh. It‘s a shark. long dead. Then more
sharks appear. along with codﬁsh, crabs
and a lobster. A few of the ﬁsh look
freshly ensnared. but most are a couple
of weeks along in the process of decay.
This net is clearly a highly efﬁcient
ﬁsh-catching engine. But for two to
three years no ﬁsherman has tended it—
witness the seaweed entwined in it.
Whoever set this net has no idea where
it is. Maybe it was torn loose by a storm.
Maybe it was set negligently in the ﬁrst
place. But. like a programmed robot
lacking a command to halt. it goes on
catching and killing. because it is made
of virtually indestructible nylon mono-
ﬁlament. It‘s a gill net gone rogue.
Sports ﬁshermen have another name for
it—ghost net—and it will go on ﬁshing
forever.

 

It is dawn on Georges Bank. the most
famous ﬁshing grounds in American
history. Late the night before, 45 of us
lugged our cod-ﬁshing rods. tackle boxes
and foul-weather gear aboard the party
boat Yankee Captains in Gloucester,
Mass. We then tried to settle down for a
few hours‘ sleep in the bunks below-
decks as she headed out to Georges
Bank. a hundred miles southeast of

Gloucester. One could argue that histor-
ic Georges Bank. with its marvelous
bounty of ﬁsh. particularly cod. under—
wrote the European settlement of the
Northeast.

 

 

Netters like Morse (above, right) can use
high-tech electronics (above) to locate
quan'y. Often fish are in a sorry state (far
right) when taken from a net (right). Some-
times porpoises stray into the lethal mesh.

As the day breaks. the sea is utterly
calm. “Hey.“ somebody says as the
dawn comes up, “we’re on Golden
Pond!“ And. for a while. the ﬁshing is
golden. as cod after cod hits our heavy
metal lures. which are being worked
close to the bottom. 30 fathoms down.

But at precisely 7:05 am. it is all over.
That‘s when a commercial ﬁshing boat
cuts into our line of drift and begins to
pay out a gill net right in our path. Paul
Beal. skipper of the Yankee Captains.
picks up his bullhorn and tells us to haul
up our lines. Otherwise we'll lose our
gear. Beal starts the engines. and we
move a good distance off from the com—
mercial boat before preparing to begin
another drift. Our jigs barely hit bottom
again when another commercial craft

moves across our bow. There will be six
more such incidents before our days
ﬁshing is done. Tony Anisowicz. a sports
ﬁsherman from Newton. Mass. says bit—
terly. “They watch us with binoculars.

as

A calm day on the famed Georges Bank with
the cod running is a sports angler’s dream.

Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico Fishery
Management councils have slashed the
annual commercial quota of the species
from 1.66 million pounds in 1985 to
700,000 last year. The NCMC estimates
that it will take 15 years for the king
mackerel Gulf stock to recover.

The problem is worldwide. To take
but one example. the once great Atlantic
salmon ﬁshery in Ireland is threatened
by virtually unregulated gill-netting,
and there have been outbreaks of vio-
lence in Britain between sports ﬁsher—
men and gill-netters.

The problem sometimes is manifested
in unexpected ways. The plastic rings
that hold canned drinks together in six-
packs become miniature gill nets when

SSIUSHSIJ BNIUVWV £0 NOISIMO SliSSﬂHOVSSVW/UUVO OTONHV

they are discarded in the sea. When ﬁsh

and birds get caught in the rings, they
often starve because they cannot swal-
low properly or are slowly garroted as
they grow larger.

The case against gill nets may be
summarized as follows:

1) They are indiscriminate in what
they catch. Selectivity is determined
only by where they are set and the size of
the mesh.

2) They preempt the use of the ﬁshing
grounds by others.

3) The quality of the catch is poor be-
cause gill nets are frequently left untend—
ed for long periods.

4) Fish. mammals and birds that ﬁght
their way out of the nets are often so se-
verely cut in their struggles by the wire-
like monoﬁlament that they subsequent-
ly die from loss of blood or infection.

5) Because the nylon monoﬁlament
mesh is all but indestructible, nets that
are lost or even legally discarded go on
“ﬁshing” for years.

“The ﬁsh can’t hide anymore,” says
Tom Morse, a gill-netter based in
Gloucester. Poke your head into the
wheelhouse of his boat, Surprise, a bat-
tered wooden 52-footer built in Virginia
10 years ago, and you will see why. Sur-
prise carries as much electronic equip-
ment as the sleekest Bertram sportﬁsh-
erman: loran, which will direct Morse
onto a given square yard of the Atlantic
by using satellite signals; a sonar ﬁsh
ﬁnder; a split-screen video ﬁsh ﬁnder;
direction ﬁnders; a ship-to-shore radio;
and, of course, the radar that enables

Starfish gather on a bluefish that has he-
come trapped in an untended “ghost net.”

Surprise to stay longer on ﬁshing
grounds in bad weather than boats could
hope to in the old days.

Morse, 60. is the president of the New
England Gillnetters Association. and he
believes he has nothing to hide or to be
ashamed of. Which is why. as the annual
migration of cod heads into Massachu-
setts Bay, he has welcomed an observer
and a photographer on board this spring
morning. Three hours after we leave
Gloucester, we begin to haul the ﬁrst
net. It has been untended for two days
because, says Morse, bad weather had
kept Surprise in port.

The gill net most commonly used in
the North Atlantic is not sophisticated.
The bottom is anchored to the ﬂoor of
the sea with weights. and the net is held
up by ﬂoats attached to the top. A single
net is about 100 yards by 6 yards. and a
professional like Morse may ﬁsh as
many as 30 nets joined together. That‘s
more than 11/2 miles of net, and he
may have two such sets ﬁshing
simultaneously.

Its harshest critics do not claim that
gill-netting is easy work. Even when the
sea is calm, it is hard and hazardous la-
bor. Today the sea is relatively calm. but
one member of the crew is off at a wed-
ding, and so the work of three men will
have to be split by two. Morse wrestles
the net onto the drum winch as it is
hauled, while mate Mark Krantz. 20.
stows the glistening wet monoﬁlament
in the hold and at the same time pulls the
catch out of the mesh with a steel hook.

If you can call it a catch. Unlike
monoﬁlament, cod are biodegradable.
The ﬁrst one to come aboard. like many
that will follow, is a repellent sight——

 




 

move in when they see us getting ﬁsh.
There’s no more haddock left. Now
they’re even gearing up to take pollack."

A nonﬁsherman might think that
Anisowicz has little right to squawk. Af-
ter all. hasn’t Georges Bank—the setting
for the maritime classic Captains Coura-
geous, by Rudyard Kipling—been ﬁshed
commercially for more than three cen-
turies? It has indeed, but not with the
gear on the boats we had encountered—
i.e., the sophisticated electronic equip-
ment and the monoﬁlament gill nets

that have become widely available in
the past decade. Gill—netting in particu-
lar has spawned a method of commer-
cial ﬁshing so destructive, its critics say,
that it threatens sportﬁshing in the
coastal areas of the US. where the prac-
tice is unregulated. And anglers aren’t
the only ones who are outraged by the
spread of gill-netting. They are joined by
ecologists, who are concerned about the
casual destruction of marine mammals
and shorebirds that become ensnared in
the nearly invisible strands of the mesh.
Even some of the commercial ﬁshermen
who employ traditional methods of
catching ﬁsh and consequently are
threatened with being driven out of busi-
ness are questioning the unregulated use
of such nets.

 

 

There‘s nothing complicated about a
gill net. According to the National
Coalition for Marine Conservation
(NCMC). a nonproﬁt organization
headquartered in Savannah that is dedi-
cated to conserving ocean ﬁsh, it is "a
ﬂat net whose meshes are capable of
capturing ﬁsh by permitting head and
gill covers to pass through the net in one
direction but not be withdrawn.” Gill
nets used to be expensive because they
were made of linen and they required
constant repair as the twine quickly
grew old and weakened. They also were
not all that efﬁcient. because they were
highly visibile to their quarry. Now the
mesh is made of nondegradable nylon
that’s almost invisible, and $500 will buy
you one of commercial quality.

Gill-netting takes slightly different
forms and presents somewhat different
problems from place to place. On the
Paciﬁc Coast. for example. the NCMC
estimates that unanchored pelagic drift
nets, suspended at predetermined
depths, ensnare and kill an average of
about 2,000 sea lions a year, as well as
seabirds, turtles, porpoises. dolphins and
even whales. At one point, roller-rigged
gill nets used off the Florida Keys
threatened the population of king mack—
erel in the Gulf of Mexico (SI, April 13.
1981 ). Over the last few years the South

mushy, huh?" says Krantz. But he pitch-
es it into the ﬁsh box. Only the very
worst codﬁsh—the ones Morse calls
sealers, which are literally nothing but
skin and bones—are thrown back.
Morse has an explanation for the condi-
tion of the cod. “Sand ﬂeas,” he says.
“We‘re on a bad patch for sand ﬂeas
here. They eat away a ﬁsh in a day.”
Much later, at dockside, his ﬁsh will
fetch 30% less than the market price for
line-caught ﬁsh, and he seems neither
surprised nor dismayed.

Besides cod, Morse’s gill net has
snared a number of unwanted species,
all of which are dead and will be ﬂung
back into the sea. Among them
are plump shad (which were hom-
ing into northeastern rivers for
spawning), skate, crabs, sculpin
and lobster. Suddenly the net pulls
oﬂ its track on the winch, and
Morse rushes to the gunwale to
see what the trouble is. Entangled
in the net is a harbor porpoise-—
an air-breathing mammal and
one of the few species of porpoise
found in the North Atlantic. Its
sides cut from its struggle for free-
dom, the porpoise has died of suf-
focation. Morse works it free of
the net, and it falls back into the
sea to drift away on the tide.

“You could be out all season
and not see the likes of that
again,” Morse says. Perhaps, but
as he and Krantz haul in the re-
mainder of the net, six more dead
porpoises come with it. Holes in
the mesh indicate that other por-
poises possibly hit the net and ei-
ther fought through it or, more
likely, suffocated and then slipped
out. Morse juts his chin and says only.
“Let’s move our nets out of the way of all
these sand ﬂeas and porpoises.”

On the run back to Gloucester, he
puts aside thoughts of the dead por-
poises and talks about the gill-netter/
angler conﬂict. “1 can understand the
sports ﬁshermen’s plight,” he says. “If I
have my nets set in a good place, then
they have their work cut out to ﬁsh it.
But they can’t put us out of business."
Morse makes an effort to communicate
with the party-boat crews, by giving
them loran bearings of where he has
set his nets so they can avoid losing tack—
le. Despite his efforts. Morse admits.

“the sports ﬁshermen really hate us.”

Morse, at least, is a professional; gill-
netting is his livelihood. The real bane of
the sports ﬁsherman is the amateur gill-
netter. Captain Paul Forsberg of Mon-
tauk, N.Y., speaks of these opportunists
with contempt. “We’ve got part-timers
who put out unmarked nets," he says.
“They come out every three days and
count the skeletons in the net. They pre-
empt the spot so nobody else can ﬁsh
there, and that net is killing all the time.
It’s skeleton ﬁshing. If the law required
them to stay and tend their nets, they
wouldn’t be there. They would try it one
night and say, ‘— on this. I’m not go-
ing to stay out here freezing my ass off.’

there and doesn’t come back for three
days? I’ve been ﬁshing that spot for 35
years, and he can take it away from me?
The law says I have to keep away if the
gear is marked properly, but this jackass
hasn’t done that. I know it’s there. I can
see it on my echo sounder. But somehow
my anchor gets into it. Sorry about that.”
The violence is getting ever closer to
the surface on Massachusetts Bay.
“There are Wall-to-wall gill nets from
Cape Ann to Maine,” says Tom Hill.
who operates a party boat out of
Gloucester. “1 went to a [New England
Fisheries Council] meeting up in Maine
last spring with the gill-netters. I spoke
my piece very gentlemanly, dressed in
my suit and everything, and one
man said, ‘We‘re going to give you
a private hearing out back, soon
as we’re done with this meeting.
And we’re going to kick the

saying, ‘We’ll take care of your
wife, too,” and ‘Tom, I think you
ought to go out and take a look at
your boats. I think they‘ve got a
little water in them.’ So, of course.
I go chugging out in the middle of
the night, but it was just words.”
Hill believes a constitutional
case can be made against unregu-
lated gill-netting. “The recre—
ational ﬁsherman is an owner of
the resource in common with all
the citizens of this country," he
says. “It’s only the benign acqui-
- escence of the public that allows
commercial ﬁshing. Think of

'ONI ‘O‘IONUV HBle/WVGNBAVS 0335

 

Discarded six-pack holders frequently become mini gill nets.

They‘re probably lobstermen most of
the time and only part-time gill-netters.
But we also have the weekend war-
riors—doctors and lawyers. They don’t
have their gear marked right, they
aren’t on the radio, they don’t give a
damn. Today’s Saturday, and they’re go-
ing to make so many dollars. They lose a
net? They don’t care. They go back and
buy another."

Already a certain frontier justice is
being doled out on the ﬁshing grounds.
Says Forsberg. “Can I help it if my an-
chor drags into some cowboy’s net and
puts a hole in it? Who owns that spot?
Does he own it because he puts his net

cially, until in the end it came down

‘Enough is enough.’

In a few places in the US, that‘s what
has happened with gill-netting. Texas.
Georgia and South Carolina have
banned it altogether, and Florida has
prohibited the use of certain kinds of
roller-rigged gill nets. Canada has out-
lawed pelagic gill nets—those that drift.

Inmates Help Horses Learn Trust, Control

By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

With names like Capone, Serpico
and Magnum, it’s evident that a
Sunday school class didn’t name
and train the wild horses being auc-
tioned Friday and Saturday near
Union.

The mustangs came from the
wide open ranges out West to the
auction by way of the Fremont Cor-
"ectional Facility at Canon City,
3010., where inmates had trained
he horses to accept halters.

The federal Bureau of Land
vfanagement has been operating
he program to cut the numbers of
mustangs because of overgrazing of
angelands. But it was Ron Zaidlicz,
ne of the bureau’s veterinarians
rom Chicago, who added the in-
:iates two years ago;

Zaidlicz said the program served

two goals — it calms the horses,
making them more marketable to
the public, and it give the inmates
much-needed jobs.

“They really are an amiable
bunch,” Zaidlicz said of the con-
victs. “They’re in for everything
from drugs to burglary to murder
--_ the whole nine yards. To be in
the program, they have to be what
we call ‘medium out’ — candidates

to be given a little more freedom,

outside.”

Zaidlicz, who had to take a
course in criminal corrections be-
fore being allowed to associate with
the convicts, said the men at the
prison thought highly of the pro-
gram..He said most were from cit-
ies, with only a few having taming
or livestock backgrounds.

“Some of them are too tough:

they’re afraid to admit they could

get hurt,” he said. “But you can be
in there yahooing it one minute and
be on the way to the hospital the
next. .

“We’ve never had anybody try to
escape. We did have one guy who
quit. He told the other convicts that
being outside like that was making
him itchy. But he didn’t want to
jeopardize the program. The prison
people have told me they’ve never
seen the inmates so protective of a
program.”

Up to 60,000 horses have been
placed through the federal govern-
ment’s Adopt-A-Horse program.
Forty-four horses were up for
adoption Friday and Saturday at
Longmeadow, a center for abused
horses. Longrneadow is operated by
the Humane Society of Missouri.

The horses are available for
$125, which covers transportation,

health tests and vaccinations. New
owners are required to show that
they have an adequate corral and
pasture for their horse. The adopt-
ed animals remain. wards of the
federal government for the first
year to assure they are getting
proper care.

Zaidlicz said the wild horses
could be intimidating before they
had been handled by humans. “The
gentling down by the inmates gives
them a head start,” he said.

He said people often wanted to
know about an animal before they
adopted it, so the inmates kept
charts on their horses. He read
from a report an inmate submitted
on a horse named Little Girl: “She’s
a very, very gentle horse. Will eat
out of your hand. Attitude and be-
havior of. a 1-year-old child. Very

You know how bow-—and-arrow hunt-

One young lady in my area likes to

groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, and any
other little animals she encounters. Kills
them with her bow and arrow.

She doesn’t kill rabbits for food, or
because she wants to thin out the herd.
She doesn’t kill squirrels because she
wants to commune with nature or for
the thrill of the hunt, giving the animal a
sporting chance and all that.

Like the man who ran over the rabbit

They are of no significance to her.

Kibo the baby giraffe walks
tall after 7 weeks at the 200

By Lorraine Iannello
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

 

The newest giraffe at the 200 could
have been named after a spice, a beer or
someone’s mother, but instead it was
christened after an African mountain
peak.

On Wednesday, Laura Swor, 26, of
Carrollton, formally christened the 7-
week-old giraffe “Kibo.” .

Dallas Zoo officials selected Swor’s
suggested moniker from among hun-
dreds they received in a week-long con-
test after the March 2 birth of the 130—

‘pound, 6-foot tall baby.

“I just thought it needed a good~Afri-
can name,” said Swor, who teaches
fourth grade at Holy Cross Lutheran

. School in Dallas. “Kibo is the name of
x the largest peak of Mount Kilimanjaro.

Kibo’s beauty and majestic height and
the fact. that it provided a home for gi-
raffes at its foot, made it seem like the
perfect name for the 200’s newest arriv—
a1.”

Swor learned about giraffes first-hand
in Africa where her father was a Luther-
an missionary and where she spent the
first 18 years of her life.

The name entries were entered on
post cards, typed on corporate letter—

heads and one was handwritten on an
elaborate 5—foot-long cut—out of a giraffe.

“There was a lot of lobbying,” said Joe
Christman, curator of mammals. “Peo-
ple wanted me to see why the name
they chose should be the one.”

One woman suggested the animal be
named Sweet Sue in honor of her moth-
er because they shared the same birth-

. day: She included a $10 check as a gift

for Sweet Sue.

Other entries included Spotsie, Spot—
ty, Speckle, Stretch, Legs and Cinna-
mon —- names too cute to win.

“We try to stay away from cutesy
names,” said zoo-hpokeswoman Victoria
Furber. “People might think of 200 ani-
mals as cute pets/They’re wild animals
and you want them to be left alone and
respected as they are.”

Every animal’s birth is recorded by
letter, number or name.

Swor and her lZ-member fourth-
grade class toured the giraffes’ quarters
as. part of their new status as Kibo’s
adoptive parents. .

For Angie Nichols, 10, the visit re—
minded her of her classmates’ teasing.

“I’m the tallest in the-amass and every-
one calls me a giraffe all year long,” said
Angie, who stands at 5 feet, 3 inches.
“I’m getting tired of it.”

A pair of popular pandas is

Vvivisectionists' up there
with those who burned dog

The horrible cruelty inflicted by
those who set fire to the dog in West
Broward on April 26 is a sad com-
ment on our society and its lack of
values.

This incident immediately brought
to mind the destruction of tens of
millions of conscious animals each '
year by the scientific community in
the name of research.

Much of this so-called research is
not experimentation at all, but end-
lessly duplicated demonstrations —
procedures being repeated hundreds
or even thousands of times.

When research animals are not be-
ing worked on, they are simply ig-
nored in cramped and dirty cages.
The reason given by the vivisection-
ists for this callous treatment is that
they regard the animals as merely
“tools for research,” not sentient be-
ings. '

The rationalization that allows the
above mentioned atrocities is com-
pletely erroneous. Animals have a
highly developed nerVous system and
brain, and do feel pain. They deserve
a life that is as free from pain and
suffering as possible. Compassion

and kindness to fellow beings must

be taught to children. These qualities

will follow them throughout their

lives and help create a better world
for all of us to share.

“Speed trap
helps save
panthers

Special to the Tribune

WEST PALM BEACH -- Your
average motorist moving down Alli-
gator Alley, State Route 84, doesn’t
expect a wildlife officer in a four-
wheel drive vehicle to ﬂash a blue
light and issue a speeding ticket, but
that’s exactly what’s happened on
more than 2,500 occasions since
January, 1985.

Patrolling for speeders doesn’t

normally fall within a wildlife offi- '

cer’s daily routine. The exception is
in the Panther Speed Zone where
motorists must slow to 45 mph at
night to safeguard endangered pan-
thers. The big cats frequently cross
the busy twodane road as it knifes
across the wild reaches of the Big
Cypress Swamp.

Major Jim Ries, the Florida
Game and Fresh Water Fish Com-
mwsion’s top law enforcement offi-
cer in the Everglades Region,
painted out half of the 21 Florida
panther deaths recorded since 1978
have been caused by speeding mo—
tprists. Four panthers died from col-
liSions "between mile marker 16 and
17 on Alligator Alley alone.

‘Since 1982 we have not had one
year where we did not lose a Flori-
da. panther on the highway, ” Ries
said. “Alligator Alley and State
Route 29, which intersects that
east-west road, have seen the major-
ity of the deaths. That’s where our
patrol efforts are concentrated.”

. A tractor-trailer struck and
killed a panther near Sunniland on
State Road 29 on Dec. 14. The large
male, believed to'be between six
and. eight years old, was wearing a
radio collar attached by Commis-
Sion biologists. The 126-pound male
had roamed a 300 square mile area
in southern Hendry County.

“We haven’t had a death since,
and a big part of the reason is our
aggressive patrolling along the Pan-

' ther Speed Zones,” Ries said. “This

isn’t a campaign of harassment. We
are fighting to save an endangered
animal, and enforcing the speed
limit on these highways is a means
to that end.”

Ries said Wildlife. Officers have
also issued 500 warnings. “We ex-
plain to all the motorists we stop
why there is a special speed zone,”
he said. “Many of them, although

. not happy about being stopped,

agree that the law makes sense. All

. of them will think twice before they

ignore the posted speed zone
again.”

MEMPHIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL
May 20, 1988

Scales of justice
give weight ‘
to fish cruelty

HAMM, West Germany (AP) ——
A court has fined two organizers
of a fishing contest about $700
each for cruelty to animals, rul-
ing that fish feel pain when
hooked and pulled from the wa-
ter. -

The decision grew out of a law-
suit filed by an animal rights
group against a local angling
, club that staged a fishing con-
test two years ago. -
The object was to see which
’ fisherman could catch the most
pounds of fish in two days. After
the fish were weighed, they
,3 were returned to the water.

Civil court Judge Horst Brink-
mann based his April 18 decision
on testimony by four wildlife
‘ experts who said an increased
heart rate and labored breath—
. ing of the fish after they were

pulled from the water indicated
that they feel pain.
: JUdge Brinkmann ruled that
fishing was permissible if fish
' were caught for useful purposes,
but that simply catching the fish
,to determine an angler’s skill
subjected the creatures to un-
usually cruel treatment.
“Fishing contests serve no
further purpose than to deter-
mine who has won,” Judge
Brinkmann ruled.

NORTH DEKALB NEWS/SUN - May 25, 1988

Fighting

DeKalb has been wrestling
with the problem of what to do
about killer dogs in the wake of
several tragic incidents with
children. One of the best ap-
proaches may be the recently
passed county ordinance that
bans training dogs for ﬁghting
purposes. The county code now
makes it illegal to awn a dog
like this.

Georgia already has stiff
laws against those who would
put dogs in a ring to fight, and
even makes watching a dog
fight illegal. But somehow
these state laws have not pre-
vented the tragic deaths of tod-
dlers.

Some people like pit bulls,
not because they want to ﬁght
them professionally, but be-
cause they like the ﬁerce dogs.
They think that it makes them
safer, or adds to their macho

Dog Ban

image, to have a ﬁghting pit
bull at their side. Forget the
fact that the dog may turn on
them or a neighboring child.

This demand for ﬁerce dogs
has prompted some exploiters
to train the animals to be
fierce. That was apparently
happening in a recent case
when a toddler was killed by a
pit bull. The owner had a deer
hoof hanging over a pen ﬁlled
with these dogs and they had
been taught to be ﬁerce.

Training dogs to ﬁght is cru- ,
elty to animals at its worst.
But these dogs trained to ﬁght
are a danger to humans as
well. Now it is illegalto either
train an animal to ﬁght, or to
possess an animal trained to
ﬁght.

This ordinance may make '
some real headway in what has
become a dangerous problem.

some on the move, others standing on their

The African elephant may become a mem- ;

ory before this century closes. '
Studies show devastation on the order of
50 percent throughout the continent in only
10 years, as the ivory trade thrives in the
shadow of corruption and upheaval. But a
plan is taking shape that would do for the
elephant what was done for the whale.
'lbday marks the start of the “Year of the
Elephant,” 3 campaign to educate Americans
(who purchase 30 percent of the world’s
carved ivory) about the elephant’s plight.

“At least 80 percent of ivory on the
market today comes from poached ele-
phants - even if it comes with all the
correct papers certifying it as legal,” says
researcher Cynthia Moss, author of a cap-
tivating new book, “Elephant Memories.”
Ms. Moss, who spent the last 20 years in
East Africa studying elephant behavior,
is a senior research adviser to the African
Wildlife Foundation (AWF), and was on
hand at the National Zoo in Washington,
DC, yesterday to help launch the foun-
dation’s Year of the Elephant project.

The campaign is a direct response to
the ﬁndings of a new study by the well-
known elephant specialist, Lain Douglas-
Hamilton, for whom Moss worked as a
research assistant when she ﬁrst went to
East Africa. The study focuses on ele-
phants in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda,
where the numbers plunged from 253,947
to 108,615 between 1977 and 1987.

“The ﬁgures are devastating,” says
AWF’s vice-president, Diana McMeekin.
“The working estimate is that there are
now 700,000 elephants on the continent,
compared with 1.5 million 10 years ago.”
David Western, chairman of the Elephant
and Rhino Specialist Group at the Inter-
national Union for Conservation of Na-
ture and Natural Resources (IUCN), says
Mr. Douglas-Hamilton has shocked people
“who didn’t want to believe that the
oﬁtake was so great in Kenya.” The sur-
vey showed that in Kenya, whose second-
largest industry is wildlife tourism, the
elephant population dropped 57 percent
in protected areas and 73 percent in un-
protected areas during the last 10 years.

While drought and human encroach-
ment on elephant habitat have contrib-
uted to the creature’s demise, the ivory
trade is the most acute threat. The IUCN
reports that 825 tons of raw ivory, with a
market value of $50 million, were traded
in 1986. The raw ivory, sold mainly in
Asia, was converted into carved ivory
worth about $500 million on the world

Average tusk size dropped from 21 pound: to 121/2 due to killing of adult elephants

market. The death toll among elephants
for the trade: 89, 000- at least 80 percent
(71, 200) of them poached.

So many adult elephants have been
killed in recent years that the average
tusk size has dropped from 21 pounds in
the mid-19709 to 12% pounds today.
Numbers don’t tell the full story. “Fifty-
ﬁve percent of elephants shot are repro-
ductive females,” says Mr. Western. Moss
says this‘hampers the survival skills of
the remaining population. “Elephant
know-how is passed on primarily through
teaching, not instinct. The slaying of ma-
ture females for their larger tusks de-
stroys the respository of knowledge
about such things as migratory routes,
water sources, and mothering skills.”

All but three of the 31 East Africa
elephant habitats Douglas-Hamilton sur-

veyed serially showed vast declines. The

few protected areas that showed in—
creases are in Kenya and include the Ma-
sai Mara Reserve, Marsabit National Re-
serve, and Amboseili National Park,
where Moss led the AmboSeili Elephant
Research Project for more than 12 years.
One of the most startling declines oc-

curred in Tanzania’s Lake Manyara Na-
tional Park, where both Moss and Doug-
las-Hamilton spent time studying
elephants, and where my own encounter
with the night stalker occurred.

“1 ﬁnd the drop in Manyara particu-
larly sad and startling,” says Moss, “not
only because I knew those elephants by

name, but because the park is small and
very manageable' in terms of its layout

and its high tourism. If elephants can’t be

‘ protected there, where can they be?” She

speculates that the poaching in Manyara
is happening at night and “within the
system” -— suggesting that rangers and
ofﬁcials are involved in some way.
Conservationists agree that in the 36
African nations with elephant popula-
tions, park managers can be part of the
poaching problem rather than the solu-
tion. “Wardens and rangers are pitifully
underpaid and underequipped,”
writes. “When the price of tusks is equiv-
alent to an ofﬁcer’s yearly salary, the
temptation to poach is overwhelming.”
Unfortunately, the temptation is grow-
ing - right alongside increasing ivo?’
prices. In 1960, ivory sold at about 2 35

a pound. By 1978, it had climbed to $35,
and this year it soared to $68. Says the
AWF’s McMeekin: “Ivory is increasingly
being purchased as a hedge against inﬂa-
tion, saved against the day it is no longer
in supply and prices hit the sky."

Civil wars in Uganda, the Central Afri-
can Republic, Sudan, and Somalia have
compounded the poaching problem. “Not
only are more automatic weapons readily
available to facilitate poaching,” says
McMeekin, “but in the turmoil of war,
civil systems have broken down and law
enforcement is lax.”

IUCN is now forming a special commis-
sion to review all aspects of ivory trade.
Regulation options include (1) revising
the current unveriﬁable quota system,
asking each nation to determine how
much ivory it can afford to export with-
out threatening the its elephant popula-
tion; (2) setting a minimum tusk size;

(3) establishing management systems
such as those in South Africa and '
Zimbabwe, where “elephants are con-
trolled like herds of cows -— they’re culled
to keep them at a sustainable level, and
limited hunting is allowed,” says
McMeekin; (4) identifying a benchmark
population of some 200 elephants in var-
ious habitats, and pouring resources into
the protection of them, rather than trying
to oversee every corner of elephant coun-
try; and (5) encouraging external sanc-
tions from countries that import ivory.

While respecting the rights of African
nations to make their own decisions about

use of their resources, Moss sees ele-

phants as an international treasure, and
hopes to prod people beyond Africa to do
their part to ensure the survival of the
species. “Developed countries could help
African conservation areas by contribut-
ing far more to their maintenance,” she
says.- In addition, Moss says she “would
like to see a temporary moratorium on
buying ivory by the American market —
until the time comes when one can be sure
that the tusk is either from an elephant
killed legally, or one that has died of
natural causes.”

Park District Pressed for Help

Oakland Zoo's Financial Bind

By Pearl Stewart
Chronicle East Bay Bureau

Oakland City Council mem-
bers and state legislators
pressed East Bay Regional Park
officials yesterday, to provide

funds for the impoverished'

Oakland Zoo.

With the future of the zoo ap-
pearing as bleak as it does. the City
Council expressed “outrage” over
the park district’s recent decision to
exclude the zoo from a fiveyear
master plan and budget. That deci-
sion was a clear rejection of at-
tempts by some legislators to get the
park district to take over the opera-
tion of the zoo.

The City Council, which con-
tributes $87,500 a year to the 200‘s
Operation from the city’s general
fund, has persuaded state and coun-
ty governments to chip in financial
support for the zoo, which is facing
a shortage of more than $400,000 in
the coming fiscal year.

The park district’s board of di-
rectors agreed last year to provide

$65,000 out of its budget for the 200
after Assemblyman Elihu Harris
and state Senator Nicholas Petris
attempted to freeze $2.6 million in
state grants to the park district until
its board of directors agreed to as-
sist the foundering zoo.

This year, the park district was
asked to increase its contribution to
$87,500. Park district general man-
_
Zoo ‘is utilized by
people throughout

the region’

 

ager Jerry Kent, however, said yes-
terday that the board of directors
has not made a decision on that.

Although various officials have
suggested that the park district take
control of the 200’s operations, Kent
said, “No one has actually proposed
to us that we should take over the
zoo, so the board decided not to add
the zoo to the master plan.”

Kent said the park district’s

DALLAS TIMES HERALD - May 17, 1988

board is working with a zoo liaison
committee, which includes Oakland
City Council members, regional
park and zoo officials, “to find long-
term solutions to the zoo’s funding
problems.”

In a written statement to the
press, Oakland City Council mem-
bers Leo Bazile, Frank Ogawa and
Marge Gibson Haskell, who are
members of the zoo liaison commit-
tee, said they were “outraged” that
the park district had excluded the
zoo from its five-year plan, because
the 200 “is utilized by people
throughout the region and should
be supported by regional funds.”

According to a recent study by
zoo officials, 82 percent of the Oak-
land Zoo’s patrons come from out-
side the city. Besides the park dis-
trict and the city of Oakland, other
contributors to the zoo are the state
and from Alameda and Contra Cos-
ta counties.

A meeting of the zoo liaison
committee was scheduled for yes.
terday afternoon. At the meeting, '
Oakland City officials said, they
would urge the regional park dis-
trict to pay its full portion.

Land acquisition for F .W. zoo expansion criticized

By Jacqulelynn Floyd
0:: THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

FORT WORTH°— A strip of
Forest Park being converted into
'a new Fort Worth Zoo exhibit
was a notorious homosexual
cruising zone shunned by area
residents before it was fenced off
as part of the 200, City Manager
Doug Harmon testiﬁed Monday.

While a shaky compromise
over proposed expansion of the

, 80-year-old zoo was reached last

year, residents of the neighbor-
hood adjacent to Forest Park,
where the 200 is, now say the

\ city improperly allowed 17 acres

of park space to be closed to the

public for construction of a new,
T $2 million Texas Diorama that

'will recreate a frontier town with
native livestock and buildings.

State District Judge Michael
Schattman last week issued a
temporary restraining order
blocking construction on the ex-
hibit until the issue is resolved.
Harmon’s testimony came during
a hearing to determine Whether
an injunction extending the con-
struction moratorium should be
issued.

C. Martin Persons, a doctor
who lives in the Forest Park
neighborhood, early this month
ﬁled a lawsuit claiming the city
bypassed state—mandated require—
ments for public hearings before
fencing off park land to be used
for the diorama.

Persons’g attorney, Warren

Gould, tried to show during
Monday’s pretrial hearing that
the land was widely used by area
residents for tennis, picnicking
and other activities before it was
fenced off by the city last year.

But Harmon, calledgto the
stand by Gould, said the park
section in question was known to
police as a problem area that
drew constant complaints from
surrounding neighborhoods be-
cause of homosexual pickups.

Harmon said Monday that
should the city lose the case, ofﬁ—
cials would have to backtrack
through a lengthy public hearing
process or ﬁle an appeal. Both
options, he said, would delay
completion of the zoo exhibit for
months.

MANATEES AT THE zoo

A lesson plan to accompany Brock. Carullo’s Zoo Reporter feature in
tomorrow’s Tampa Tribune

Curriculum By Janet Seltz, LoWry Park’s Assistant Curator of Education

OBJECTIVE:

Students will become familiar with manatees’ unique body structure in-
corporating the concept of aquatic vs. land dwelling animals

MATERIALS:

Copies of Monday’s Tribune with Brock’s Zoo Reporter story,“Mana-

tees at the Zoo”, pictures of manatees, construction paper, scissors, crayons,
glue

VOCABULARY:

Aquatic, fluke, proboscis, prehensile

BACKGROUND:

_ The West Indian, or Florida, manatee is an endangered marine mammal
found in rivers, estuaries and coastal regions of Florida. Manatees reach an
average length of 10 feet and weigh 790-1200 pounds. The insulating layer of
blubber under their skin may be several centimeters thick and the body is
torpedo shaped for easy movement through the water. Manatees have pad—
dle-like front limbs and a broad, flattened tail (fluke) to provide propulsion.
The eyes are small and sight is poor because manatees are found in murky
water with low visibility. Nostrils are located on‘top of the proboscis, or
muzzle, and can be closed when the manatee submerges. The split lip is
prehensile and very mobile. It is used to grasp the aquatic vegetation on
which manatees feed. The elephant is the only living relative of the manatee.

ACTIVITY:

1. As a class, read this week’s zoo reporter story, “Manatees at the Zoo.”
Using pictures of manatees, discuss what the animal looks like. Ask students
to describe in their own words what a manatee looks like.

2. Describe the various features of manatees that make them suitable
aquatic dwellers. How are they adapted to their environment?

3. Divide the class into groups. Assign each group one part of a
manatee that is important for aquatic life (closing nostrils, fluke,
etc). Ask students “How would a manatee look if it lived on land?”

The student’s objective is to re-design their part of a manatee, mak-
ing it suitable for life on land. Compare and contrast the aquatic
and land features. '

4. Using construction paper and crayons, have each group de-
sign their land part. Assemble all pieces to create a land mammal.

Look for this week’s Zoo Reporter in Monday’s Tampa Tribune.

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank your for letting me know of your support for S. 2089,
which would regulate the’sale of federal lands for oil shale
production.

I share your concern that our oil shale resources be properly
managed and that no group or individual be allowed to make an
inflated profit by reselling federal lands without a diligent
effort to extract the resources they contain. S. 2089, sponsored
by Senators Melcher and Uirth, is awaiting hearings before the
Subcommittee on Mineral Resources Development and Production. I
am looking forward to reviewing the testimony given in these
hearings and to having a chance to act upon the bill when it
comes before the full Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.

I appreciate hearing from you about this issue. I hope you
will continue to let me know your feelings on matters of
importance to you.

Dear Mrs. Iarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your concern about efforts
to permit increased hunting of swans.

I share your interest in efforts to insure the continued
survival Of the swan, as well as other wildlife. As you may
know, I have long been a supporter of wildlife protection
legislation such as the Endangered Species Act and the Marine
Mammal Protection Act.

In the last four years, swan hunting has been permitted in
North Carolina on an experimental basis, and Montana had a
similar program in 1983. This year, New Jersey has requested
permission to issue twenty swan-hunting permits and Virgina has
requested six hundred.

The Atlantic Flyway, an advisory group consisting of federal
Fish and Wildlife Service representatives and Fish and Game
officials from each state from Maine to Florida, has endorsed the
New Jersey and Virginia plans as being consistent with proper
wildlife management practices. By law, the Fish and Wildlife
Service must consider the proposals as part of its programming
and issue a decision by August, 1988.

While Congress is not directly involved in this recent
decsion-making, I assure you that I will continue to monitor this
situation with your thoughts and the need to protect our nation's
wildlife resources prominent in my mind.

I appreciate hearing from you on this important issue, and I
hope you will continue to inform me about those matters of

importance to you.

Panda exhibit endangered ‘

"‘ Club says it may drop support for animals’ Visit

By Dennis Pfaff
News Staff Writer

The Michigan United Conservation
Clubs will decide today whether to drop
support for a plan to bring two rare giant
pandas to Detroit -‘ a pullout that officials
say would doom the exhibit.

MUCC Director Thomas Washington
said Monday he will decide whether to drop
the plan after meeting today with top state
. Department of Natural Resources officials.

“I need to have some assurances or we’re
just going to go on to other business,”
Washington said.

The MUCC and the DNR have been
working jointly on the proposed exhibit,

originally set to open this month at the
Michigan State Fairgrounds. The MUCC
had pledged to underwrite the estimated
$600,000 start-up costs.

, To begin preparations, Washington said,
the MUCC must have state approval to use
the fairgrounds and must work out a formula
to distribute the proceeds.

“As each day lops off, it makes it more
difficult, if not getting closer to impossible,
to recover our investment,” Washington
said. He said the large sum involved makes it
“exceedingly difficult to let half of the sum-
mer get away from me and also someone 50
miles away to get a head start on promo—
tion.”

Washington’s comments came after US.
Fish and Wildlife Service ofﬁcials said they
had granted the Toledo Z00 formal permis-
sion to import a pair of ' giant pandas for a
100-day exhibit. A similar request for the
Detroit exhibit has been delayed until June 6
because it was deemed incomplete.

Incoming DNR Director David Hales
said an MUCC pull—out probably would
doom the exhibit. 1

“The partnership between the state and
the MUCC has always been critical to the
sucézess of pulling off this project,” Hales
sai .

Wildlife Service spok sman David Klin-
ger said Monday that perﬁiits were issued for

__l___.-- 7

the Toledo exhibit late Friday, shortly after
his agency received a telegram from China
assuring that proceeds from the exhibit"
would be used for panda conservation. ..

“I think we’ve all breathed a sigh of relief
here, although we’ve been confident all
along,” said Toledo Zoo spokeswoman Betsy
Clark.

She said the two animals, Le Le, a male,
and Nan Nan, a female, should arrive in:
Toledo late Friday and should be on display

about a week later. Both are about 81/2 years
old, she said. ,
' Despite getting the permit, the Toledo?-
exhibit may face a legal challenge from the"
World Wildlife Fund, a private group which
opposes the Detroit and Toledo exhibits.

WWF spokesman Ken Cook said the
group is “certainly looking at” going to court .
to block the Toledo exhibit.

lWillie B. takes to the jungle

Zoo Atlanta’s famous gorilla steps outdoors for first time in 27 years

Associated Press

ATLANTA — Willie B. found it’s
a jungle out there.

Zoo Atlanta’s famous gorilla saw
something Friday that he hasn’t
seen since he was captured in Af-
rica 27 years ago: green grass be-
neath his feet and open sky above
his head.

As reporters and photographers
watched from behind trees and
across a protective moat, the 30-
year-old lowland gorilla stepped
hesitantly into his new outdoor
quarters, a $4.5 million simulated

_ rain forest where he will live near

13 other gorillas and a host of other
apes.

Skeptical of those watching him,
he spent almost an hour stepping
back and forth from his enclosed
shelter before he seemed secure
enough to run atop his hill
scamper for food and begin ripping
down tree limbs.

“I think he has responded well.
He came through. He seems to be
enjoying his environment,” said a

t'beaming Terry Maple, director of

Zoo Atlanta.
Last month, Willie B. was moved

from his tile walled, steel- barred
cage — his home since he arrived at
the zoo in 1961 — into the new in-
door quarters he will use for sleep
and shelter.

After five weeks to grow accus-
tomed to the enclosure, with his
keeper of 14 years often sleeping
nearby to keep him company, he
was allowed to roam free. Zoo offi-
cials don’t know if he can remem-
ber being outdoors.

For now, Willie will live in an
area of his own, adjacent to three
“families" of gorillas on loan from
Emory University's Yerkes Primate
Research Center. They’re all sepa-
rated to prevent fights. Zoo officials
hope that within a year Willie can
be introduced to another gorilla —-
probably a female, with whom they
hope he’ll breed.

The new exhibit, according to
Zoo Atlanta officials, is the most ad.
vanced gorilla habitat at any zoo.
Named the Ford African Rain For-
est and built with $1 million from
the auto manufacturing company,
it’s the latest stage in a $26 million
renovation at the 99-year-old 200.

The exhibit will open to the pub-
lic June 11.

Just four years ago, the US.
Humane Society named the zoo one
of the nation’s worst. The US. De-
partment of Agriculture slapped

sanctions on the zoo for poor '

record-keeping on animal care. The
deaths of star animals made na-
tional headlines, and political tur-
moil gripped the ,citysowned attrac-
tion.

In 1985, Maple, a Georgia Tech
University animal behavior special-
ist who helped turn around the New
Orleans zoo, was named director,
and operations were handed to a
non-profit agency.

As for Willie 3., Friday was not
his first time in the limelight. in
1981 an Atlanta TV station handed
him a suitcase to recreate a popular
luggage commercial that showed an
ape bashing -—- but not breaking ‘—
the product.

Willie ripped the leather cover
off the suitcase, ripped the two
sides apart from the hinges, filled
one half with Water and drank from
it.

on a tree branch.

Refuge may not be
safe from fund cuts

School plan jeopardizes center in Savannah

By Jingle Davis

OATLAND ISLAND, Ga. ~—
Rascal, a baby otter recently
found wandering the streets of
downtown Savannah, has adapted
well to life at the Oatland Island
Education Center, where he swims
in a plastic pool and dines on do-
nated fish and fresh strawberries.

A disabled bald eagle and a
ﬂedgling owl seem content at Oat-
land, too; so do the injured peli-
cans, the endangered panthers.
the wolves, the bears and the alli-
gators.

But because the Savannah-
Chatham County Board of Educa-
tion’s recently proposed desegre—
gation plan calls for spending
operating funds to build new
schools and reorganize others,
Oatland‘s future as an animal ref-
uge and environmental education

center is uncertain, according to

the center‘s executive director,

Tony Cope.

Cope said the draft budget
proposed by the school system for
next year would eliminate at least

'two of the nine teachers at Oat-

land, which has operated since
1974 under the auspices of the
board of education.

And depending on the out-

come of the federal court case ,

that will set the desegregation
plan, Oatland‘s budget could be
cut to the point the center would
have to close completely, Cope
said. ~

“I’ll be nervous about it until
the budgets actually finalized."
Cope said. “I’ve heard rumors

we‘ll lose six teachers instead of

two, and there's no way we can op-

erate with three teachers.”

plan to spend $8. 4 million 1n operat-

salaries for ﬁnancing new school
conStruction and reorganization.

, “The budget was drafted so
there wOuld be no fatal impact on
:any one program,” Ostrow said.
“But I hate to say there’s no danger
.at all that Oatland will close.”

. - Cope said Oatland hosts about
35,000 schoolchildren each year.

The students come to the 175-acre=

center to participate in ﬁeld trips
designed to provide hands-on expe-
riences with plants and animals,
fresh water ponds and salt marshes,
astronomy, energy sources, chemis-
try, fossils and a variety of other
scientiﬁc programs.

At a log cabin settlement tucked
back in the woods, Oatland instruc-
tors show students how to split
wood shingles, make candles, pull
taffy and use hand tools such, as
crosscut saws and lathes.

Oatland, located between Savan-
nah and Tybee Island, is also open
to the public. Cope said about 75-

woods or in habitats built by former
students and to participate in such
events as an annual craﬁs festival
at the log cabin compound.

The price of admission is a can
of dog or cat food per visitor. Cope
said the admission fee, supplement-
ed by donations from local ﬁsher-
men and others, supplies food for
the center’s 50 or so captive ani-
mals all year.

The school board’s current bud-
get crisis resulted from a need to
desegregate the school system, Os-
trow said. The board’s plan calls for
spending money on construction
and consolidation of schools, in-
cluding the creation of magnet
schools that would attract minority
and white students interested in
special academic programs. .

But a $179 million bond issue
that would have ﬁnanced a desegre-
gation plan failed to win voter ap-
proval in February and the board is
scrambling to ﬁnd funds for an al-
ternate plan still under consider-
ation by US District Judge B.
Avant Edenﬁeld.

Curtis V. Cooper, president of
the Savannah branch of the NAACP,’
said the judge is considering at
least three desegregation plans.
Cooper said Edenﬁeld is expected
to reach a decision “any day now.”

A 1971 federal court order man-
dating desegregation of local

The Justice Department and the
NAACP approved the plan that
would have been ﬁnanced by the
bond issue but challenged the alter-
nate plan proposed by the school
board when the bond issue failed.

Both the Justice Department
and the NAACP have proposed
plans of their own, Cooper said.

Depending on Edenﬁeld’s deci-
sion, the school board could be
forced to spend more to meet deseg—
regation requirements, Ostrow said.

“Edenﬁeld’s ruling could have a
deﬁnite impact on the budget,” he
said. “It could mean even deeper
cuts in the operating funds.”

In the most recent draft of the
budget for the school system, about
50 teaching positions would be cut
next term, including the two at Oat-
land. Ostrow said about half of the
school system’s art, music and phys-
ical education teaching positions
would also be eliminated.

“The targets [for cutting] had to

be in those areas not required by

the state,” Ostrow said. Programs
such as those conducted at Oatland
Island he said, are the “heart and

soul things you do locally to enrich

your curriculum.”

The Everglades tops a list of
the USA’s 10 most-endangered
national parks, says the Wilder-
ness Society.

The biggest threat to all 10:
mismanagement of adjoining
lands that support the parks
and their inhabitants.

The Florida swamp is in the
greatest danger, says society
spokesman Steven Whitney,
because its “lifeblood is water
and its water is threatened.”

The Interior Department,
which oversees the parks, dis-
agrees with the society. “We
don’t think any of the national

‘ Wildlife officials purring _
over Highlands big cat '

By BARRY MILLMAN
Tribune Staff Writer

SEBRING — Wildlife officials are mon-
itoring with an electronic collar a rare
Florida panther that roams Highlands
County, much farther north than the spe-
cxes was previously thought to travel.

The cat is one of two recently discov-
ered in the area. Wildlife officials Wednes-
day confirmed a May 9 sighting of a
“second panther, seen east of Lake Arbuck-
le, near the Highlands-Polk county line.

No other panthers have been verified
this far north in Florida, biologists said.

Dr. James Layne, a wildlife ecologist at
the Archbold Biological Station who spe-
cializes in mammals, said the collared cat
represents a breakthrough in the study-of
the endangered species. »

“Up until now, most of the state’s avail-
able resources have been focused farther
south, down in the protected Everglades
and Big Cypress regions,” said Layne, who
discussed the panthers before the exis-
tence of the second animal was confirmed.

“Now that we have proof that one indi- _

vidual, and perhaps two, are surviving this '

far north on what are primarily private
lands, there may be an intensified effort to
look for them up here.”

Dr. David Maehr, a wildlife biologist
with the Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission and coordinator of the
state’s efforts to study the big cats, said
Tuesday a search team captured a 126-
pound, adult male panther Jan. 30, fitted '
him with a radio-transmitting collar and
released the animal a few miles east of the
biological station.

Since then, transmitter readings show
the panther has roamed from Avon Park
to 15 miles south of the biological station.

Due to their secretive nature, nocturnal
behavior and fondness for solitude, an ac-
curate census of the state’s panther pop-
ulation is difficult, say experts. Estimates
range from 300 to fewer than 30.

Maehr, who has led the state’s search
for the elusive cats since 1985, said the
Highlands panther is the eleventh to be .-
collared and monitored by the state. 5

“The habitat where this individual is 5'
surviving is very different from the pres":

tected lands where our other sub-
jects are being tracked,” he said.

“How this northern cat coexists
with his environment can teach us a
great deal. The development of the
citrus industry — which removes
the very habitat panthers have al-
ways thrived in —— the cattle indus-
try and large-scale vegetable
farming, have combined to create a
tenuous environment for him.

“In light of those pressures, it’s
important to the future of the pan-
ther population to discover why he

‘ hasn’t been eliminated.”

Discovery of panther droppings,
known as seats, and other evidence
of his existence spurred the search
that led to his capture, said Maehr.

“They are very much creatures
of habit, particularly males,” he
said.

Still, Maehr said, luck played an
important part in the searchers’
succeszul hunt for the cat.

“We had scheduled 13 days for
the search, and it was the last day,”
said Maehr. “Several times we’d
found ourselves only a day behind
him, but never closer. It was getting
dark and we had to leave due to
prior commitments.

“RoyMcBride, the dog handler
who had been contracted by the
state to help us track the panther,
had already put his dogs in their
boxes and we were about ready to
leave the area when we discovered

fresh scat. We decided to let the
dogs out for one last look around,
and a half hour later they had him
treed.”

' McBride, of Alpine, Texas, trav-
els the world to capture big Cats. He
said the Highlands panther, like
most Florida panthers, was just a
big pussycat.

“They aren’t anything like leop-
ards,” said McBride. “Now that’s a
mean animal. Panthers basically

' just want to avoid you and be left

alone. Even when they’re cornered,
they’d rather look for a hole to
crawl through rather than attack.
They’re extremely nonaggressive.”

After the cat was treed, McBride
called in a recovery team. The ani-
mal was tranquilized, measure-
ments were taken and he was fitted
with an electronic collar.

The locations of all 11 collared
cats are monitored from a plane
three times a week, Maehr said.

Maehr’s airborne watchdogs
soon may have another panther to
track. A meeting of the Governor’s
Panther Recovery Council in Na-
ples was told Wednesday that plas-
ter casts made from tracks found
near Lake Arbuckle came from
panther prints.

Layne said measurements of the
heel pad of those tracks indicate a
younger, female cat.

“The tract where the latest
tracks were cast and the known
range of the male already collared
are (connected),” he said.

Suit seeks to force Ohio zoo
:0 return 2 pandas to China

By Jeff Nesmith

journal-Constitution Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON — With offi-
ials complaining of a “prolifera-
ion of rent-a-panda deals,” an in-
ernational wildlife group and an
.ssociation of zoos filed suit in
3.8. District Court here Tuesday.
E‘heir goal: Return to China two
giant pandas being exhibited by
the Toledo Zoo in Ohio.

The Toledo exhibit opened
Tuesday despite the suit, which
was filed by the World Wildlife
Fund and the American Associa-
tion of Zoological Parks and
\quariums.

The two groups charged that
tianda exhibits, which have
‘irought sharp increases in ticket
«ales at zoos and amusement
warks, are illegal exploitations of
he endangered creatures.

They asked the court to order
the animals’ return to China as
soon as is consistent with their
safety and well-being. The suit

also requests an injunction to bar
the Fish and Wildlife Service from
issuing permits for any other pan-
da imports into the United States.

An application for permission
to exhibit a pair of pandas at the
Michigan State Fair this summer
is pending with the Fish and Wild-

life Service, and zoo officials in At-

lanta and Cincinnati have an-
nounced plans to exhibit pandas
this year.

The two organizations had
sought to prevent importation of
the pandas, a male and a female,
to Toledo but were denied a tem-
porary restraining order May 12.

Fewer than 1,000 giant pandas
are believed to exist in the wild.
They are confined to a shrinking
habitat in Sichuan province in
central China.

The organizations argued that

the Endangered Species Act re- “

quires any importation to be “for
scientific purposes or to enhance
the propagation or survival of the
species.”

sin, Matteson said. Six are being held by
wildlife managers for release later this
year and three or so apparently moved into
the state on their own from the stocking
program in Minnesota.

Trumpeter swans were never numerous
here but were found throughout the state
at one time, Matteson said.

The swans prefer to nest in fairly large
marshes far from civilization. They van-
ished from Wisconsin during the 18805,
the victims of diminishing wetlands, the
greed of market hunters and the whims of
the fashion-minded who favored the white
feathers of swans for adorning hats, Mat-
teson said.

The pair of swans gliding across the
smooth surface of Monastery Lake on
Thursday had been brought by truck in
transport cages. Sacred Heart Monastery
owns part of the property that includes the
80-acre lake, which is north of W. Woelfel
Rd., east of Highway 100 and south of
Rawson Ave.

When the cages were opened, the
swans seemed reluctant to leave. Ed Die-
bold, curator of birds at the 200, had to
guide them out, one at a time.

They squawked, flapped, paddled and
let out the loud, trumpeting cry for which
they were named. Then, the swans got
their bearings and began the long, majestic
glide across the lake.

The lake is part of a 621/2-acre sanctu-
ary owned by the Nature Foundation, an
environmental organization based in Chi-
cago. The Wisconsin Metro Audubon Soci-
ety manages the sanctuary.

“This is very exciting,” said JoAnn Gil-
lespie, who manages the sanctuary for the
society. “This is an ideal place for both the
swans and the Audubon Society.”

The sanctuary, which will be used for
wetlands research and educational pro-
grams, is the last remaining tamarack

The pair of trumpeter swans glided across the lake

swamp in Milwaukee County and contains
several endangered plant species, Gillespie
said.

Mark Andersen, a wildlife manager
with the DNR, said the program to reintro-
duce the swans in Wisconsin also would
use feral mute swans as foster parents for
trumpeter swans. The mute swans, a non-
native species introduced by European set-
tlers, populate some local lakes.

Restoration efforts began last year with
placement of trumpeter swan eggs under
brooding mute swans, but predators are
thought to have killed all the young trum-
peters that hatched.

The DNR is not giving up, though. In
some cases, hatched trumpeter swans will
be matched with mute swan foster par-
ents.

§Crab Shell Disease
Found Widespread
Near Ocean Dump

 

A disease that burns holes in the
shells of lobsters and crabs has
cropped up in undersea canyons north
:of_ New York City’s newest and only
ocean dump site for sewage sludge,
prompting a Federal study of whether
the dumping is harming marine life.

While state and Federal biologists
say they do not yet have any evidence
that the sludge is killing the shellfish,
they say the illness, known as burn-spot
disease, has been found among crusta-
ceans at other sites where sewage is
dumped offshore.

Lobstermen in Point Judith, R.l., say
an unusually high percentage of lob-
sters and red crabs caught in undersea
canyons about 70 nautical miles north-
west of the dump site, which is 120
miles southeast of New York City, have
the disease.

George Whidden, a lobster boat cap-
tain who has been a leader in efforts to
5‘01? the sewage dumping, said nearly
90 Percent of the crabs and about 10
percent of the lobsters caught in Block
Canyon since the dumping began are
ShOWing Symptoms. A year ago, he
said, the disease was unheard of that
far out at sea.

He said his fellow lobster-boat opera-
tors reported that the number of lob—
sters caught in the canyons had
dropped by 70 percent since the sewage
dumping began in March 1987.

1" bum'SPOt disease, chitinoclastic
(Shell-destroying) bacteria eat through
the crustacean’s shell, leaving holes
that look as if they were burned with a
blowtorch. Silt and mud enter through
the holes and foul the gills, suffocating
the shellfish, according to Bruce T. Es-
trella, a marine biologist for the Mas—
sachusetts Division of Marine Fish-
eries who has studied the malady. .

Mr. Estrella said the bacteria, which
} breeds in the mud of ' lobstering
" grounds, often breaks out into an epi-
demic in the vicinity of sewage dumps
or dredge spoils where large amounts
of organic sludge collects, such as in
Boston Harbor. In a healthy env1ron-
ment, fewer than 1 percent of lobsters
will have the telltale holes. ' -

Until n0w, Mr. Estrella said, burn-
spot disease has seldom been reported
in the relatively pristine waters at the
edge of the Continental Shelf where the
Point Judith lobster boats set their
traps. The disease does not harm
humans, but it makes lobsters and
crabs inedible and kills large numbers
of them. Red crabs, spidery-l'egged
crabs that average about six inches
across and live in waters 600 feet deep,
are not usually eaten in restaurants,
but are used in frozen crab cocktail and
crabmeat stuffing.

 

U

Lobster Prices Shouldn’t Rise

Because there are still large lobster
crops in Canadian waters, the price of
lobster is not likely to rise soon, Ralph
Boragine, executive director of the
Rhode Island Seafood Council, said.
But the drop in the catch could cripple
the Rhode Island lobstering industry,
which brought in hauls worth over $20
million in 1986 and may bring in as lit-
tle as $6 million this season.

In addition, fishermen who ply the
waters directly over the site insist the
sewage is driving fish from the area.

' One Rhode Island company, Sea—
freeze Limited, reports that catches of
tile fish, butterfish and Squid have
plummeted 50 percent in the last six
months, with some boats suffering
drops of 70 percent. ‘

The National Marine Fisheries Serv-
ice, however, maintains there is no evi-

The New York Times/May 22, 1988
Diseased lobsters and crabs have
been found in undersea canyons
along the Continental Shelf.

 

dence the sludge is driving fish away
and believes overfishing is a more
likely explanation, said Christopher
Mantzaris, a service ecologist.

 

 

E.P.A. Plans Survey
Officials of the Federal Environmen-

" tal Protection Agency are also skepti-

cal of the lobstermen’s claims, saying
it is unlikely the shell disease is con- ‘
nected to the sewage because the can- .
yons are 70 miles from the dump site
and the dumping has not been going on
long enough to have the drastic effects
claimed by the lobstermen.

Nonetheless, the lobstermen’s pro-
tests have prompted the E.P.A. to plan
a shellfish survey next month in three
of the canyons.

“The relationship of the disease to
the dumping is not at all clear,” said
Henry Walker, a scientist with an
E.P.A. laboratory in Rhode Island.
“It’s worth looking into to confirm
whether it’s happening or not near the
106-miie site.”

In 1987, the EPA. ordered nine sew-
age authorities in New York and New
Jersey, including New York City’s, to

. stop dumping their sewage sludge at
. an 80-foot-deep site 12 miles off Sandy

Hook, N.J., because the waters there

' were turning into a virtual dead sea. By

January, they were dumping the 9 mil—
lions tons they produce each year in
6,000-foot-deep waters over the edge of
the Continental Shelf, at a spot called
the 106-Mile Site because it is that far
off Cape May, N.J., the closest landfall
at its latitude.

Most Cities Burn or Bury
Federal legislation banned ocean

2 sludge dumping in 1981, but New York

and other communities sued for and
won exceptions to the rule on the
grounds that they had no affordable al-
ternatives. ;
With the exception of Boston and Los
Angeles, which pipe sewage into the
ocean, the New York metropolitan re—

' gion is the last in the country to con-

tinue ocean dumping.

Most cities treat the sewage to re-
move toxic metals and then either bury
the rest in landfills or incinerate it.

In theory, the sludge dumped at the
new, 130-mile-square site shouid ,)
quickly become so diluted that the con-
taminants cannot affect fish. Within 20

' kilometers of the site, the ratio is
' 500,000 gallons of sea water to a single

gallon of sludge, according to the Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration.

Barges Seen Dumping Early

But fishermen say they have often
seen sludge barges, racing bad weath-
er, dump their loads closer to shore.
They also say that eddies spinning off
the Gulf Stream carry much of the
sludge back onto the Continental Shelf
and into the canyons where lobstermen
harvest their catch.

Mr. Mantzaris, of the Fisheries Serv-
ice, said of the fishermen’s claims of
declining catches: “There’s no ques-
tion about it, there’s something hap-
pening out there. Ocean dumping may
not be the sole cause of the problem,
though.”

Because of the large number of local
industries flushing waste into the
sewers, the sludge from New York and
New Jersey is more polluted with pesti-
cides, PCB’s and heavy metals such as
lead, cadmium and mercury than sew-
age from other cities, said Charles
Ehler, chief of marine assessment for
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.

He pointed out that this sort of con-
tamination is more likely to affect bot-

 

 

 

 




tom-dwellers, such as tile fish, than no-
madic species such as haddock and
mackerel. It is catches of bottom-
dwelling fish that have dropped the
most. But he added that N.O.A.A. has
not studied fish near the dump.

‘Poisoning the Habitat’

“We know chemicals have effects on
individuals in fish populations, but
what are the effects on the entire popu-'
lation? That’s where we break down
very quickly as scientists,” he said.

Such ‘hairsplitting is nonsense to peo-
ple like Mr. Whidden, who has fished
off the New England coast for 40 years
and says he has never seen as many
diseased lobsters and crabs as he has
since the dumping started at the 106-
mile site.

“We’re poisoning the habitat,” he
said. “We’re killing the habitat of
everything on that coast.” _

Mr. Whidden is the leader of a rap-
idly growing group of fishermen on the
Eastern Seaboard that call themselves
the Coalition to CeaseOcean Dumping.
Founded in April, the organization al-
ready has more than 800 members who
have donated money to lobby against
the dumping.

Dove hunting in Argentina

 

i

was a quite enioya

RIO TERCERA, Argentina ——
Here is perhaps one of the last
frontiers of wing shooting'in the
world. More that, it is like hunting
was in the states a hundred years

ago, only better.

. If it seems strange to be hunting
in May, remember that May in
Argentina 'is the same as November
in North America. June here has the
climate of December at home.

Moreover, the wonders of Argen-
tine hunting are largely un-
discovered in today’s world. It is
completely unspoiled because
almost none of the natives take
advantage of the incredible re-
sources and few of us foreigners
have discovered it. Add into this
equation a friendly and hospitable
population and the combination is
compelling.

In this province of Cordoba are
huge farms and ranches with vast
acreage of cereal grains, the princi-
pal export of the Argentine (the last
syllable is pronounced “tyne” not

“teen”). A grand temperate climate

with rich soils and plentiful water
produce perhaps the world’s most
bountiful harvests, not only of the

grain, but of game birds. The

 

volume of doves and ducks are a

plague to farmers and a joy to wing

shots.

is a world-class capital in a nation of '

30 million. It’s like a European
country — Spanish, British, French,
Italians, Germans. There are few
Indians and no blacks, except tour-
sts.

Any hunting trip is measured by
food and drink as well as by the

ble Iork

game. In this also, Argentina is top
class. Beef is the national dish three
meals a day. Native wines are the
national drink, with coffee and
Coca-Cola. A huge 3-inch thick,
charbroiled steak with all the ac-
companiments and a bottle of wine
is about 10 US. dollars. Food in the
boonies, in tiny restaurants or in the
field, seems a matter of national
pride. A guest eats with great
enthusiasm. Ar entine grass-fed
beef contains litt e cholesterol.
Hunters who’ve tried wing shoot-
ing in Honduras, Mexico, and Col-

~ umbia, rank Argentina as the best in

the world. We agree. Our first
morning shoot was in a fog with
thousands of darting, jet-driven
targets. Fog seemed to speed them
up and cause lower flights over a cut
sorghum field. They came from all
directions in such volume as to
present very difficult de-
cisions . . . which target to select.

,Hesitation produced frustration, ex-

treme excitement and well-wasted
shots. All those doves seemingly had
been to evasive flight schools.

‘If they can handle them in Rome, why can’t we?’

Downtown Pigeons Spared; . :
Future IS Still Up in the Air

By STEVE HARVEY,_’I’imes Staff Writer

' he pigeons of the City Hall
' ‘ environs, sentenced to death by
the city General Services
Administration last month, have won a
reprieve.

The city Animal Regulation
Department said Monday that it has
declined to issue a permit to allow the
trapping and killing of the birds, the
freeloaders that hang out in the dining
areas of the Los Angeles Mall.

Newspaper Story

“I didn't even know about it [the plan]
until I read a story in The [Apri16]
Times,” said Robert Rush, the agency
general manager at a meeting of the
Board of Animal Regulation
Commissioners,

Animal Regulation declared that the
moratorium, pending further study, was
issued soon after the article appeared
and before any of the controversial
creatures could be killed. Last year,
General Services was granted
permission to trap and lethally inject

about 800 of the birds.

But one question remained
unanswered: Is there a pigeon problem
downtown? ‘

The Animal Regulation Board said
there was, and instructed Rush to solicit
the advice of experts to make it go away.

Rush ruled out such weapons as fake
owls, poison (“What if a street person
eats the dead pigeon?”) and sterilized
feed (“It might wipe out songbirds and
state-protected doves" ).

Commissioner Arthur L. Margolis
asked why the board should be
concerned about the sterilization of a few
songbirds and doves.

“We look upon it as inhumane," Rush
said.

“But killing them’s less inhumane?”
Margolis said.

Rush said trapped birds can’t be
released elsewhere “because they just
come back.” .

At one point, board President Martin
B. Hochman joked that perhaps the
commissioners should “ask the mayor’s

King said he may also try anoth-

prongs that also make for an
uncomfortable touchdown, ledges

metal, and scarecrow owls.

The owls, King admitted, “only
work for a while in one place. Then
they [the enemy] get used to them
and you have to move them.”

“City employees who've left. their

that they [pigeons] can really mess up a
room,” she said.

She said some mall diners have
complained of the feathered interlopers,
but others have pointed out, “If they can
handle them in Rome, why can’t we?”

Nonlethal Control

Unbeknown to the Animal Regulation
Board, the GSA’s Building Services
agency says it has been successfully
managing the pigeon problem with
nonlethal means since being denied the
use of capital punishment. (N o GSA
representative was invited to the board
meeting Monday.)

Postscript

 

 

 

‘Sometimes I wonder if the animal kingdom has one up on us humans.’

Millicent Collinsworth still cannot
muster the courage to take a bus ride.
The blind woman says she shudders
when she hears loud noises and feels
“incredibly vulnerable” in public places.

But the memories of that hot afternoon
when She was trampled in an RTD bus
melee and was led home, bloodied and
bruised, by her guide dog are balanced,
she says, by an outpouring of sympathy
once her story became known.

“It will take me a lifetime to thank
everyone," Collinsworth, 40, said,
recalling the hundreds of letters, phone
calls, flowers, offers of help—including
work as an actress—she received after
the fracas. “In the long run this has had at
least one lovely side.”

Last June, Collinsworth was returning
to her Hollywood home from Westwood
in a crowded RTD bus when a man
suddenly began flailing his arms and
plishing toward the front of the bus. In
the commotion she was hit in the face,
splitting open her lip, and was thrown to
the floor. Frightened and confused, she
managed to stumble out of the bus with
her guide dog, Eeyore. .

It was Eeyore and Eeyore alone who
helped her'that day; apparently no one
else on the bus noticed her plight, and
passers-by ignored her.

During the 15-block walk home during
rush hour, she clung to Eeyore’s leash,
weeping, mistaking the blood running
down her face for tears. Only after she
got home and was found by a neighbor
did she get human help.

On Monday, the black Labrador
retriever received accolades as the “Hero
Dog” of the year from the Los Angeles
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. - -

Dog of the Year

He, too, had been trampled in the bus
fracas. His leash became tangled around
his neck, and he gasped and choked while
leading his mistress home down a path

they had never passed before.

“To this day all I know is that it was
only the dog’s intelligence that got me
home,” Collinsworth said during award
ceremonies for the dog. “It was Eeyore’s
courage and loyalty that helped me when
no one else would. Sometimes I wonder if
the animal kingdom has one up on us
humans.”

But after Collinsworth’s neighbor .
called The Times and her story was
picked up by media throughout the
country, she was deluged by a “surprising
outpouring of care.” Strangers offered to
run errands and drive for her. She still

 

corresponds with some of them.

An actress who lost her sight in an
accident about 10 years ago, Collinsworth
even played herself in an episode
recounting the bus scuffle for the CBS
police series “Houston Knights.”

She has moved to a San Dimas
condominium with her husband of five
months, Gary Williams, to whom she was
engaged at the time of the incident. She
said she has recently been approached by
two production companies interested in
her life story, but nothing firm has
emerged. While she continues to pursue
her acting career, Collinsworth has
become involved in the Screen Actors
Guild committee for disabled actors.

COllinsworth has filed a claim against
the Southern California Rapid Transit
District, which refuses to discuss the
incident because of “pending litigation.”

In an interview just before Eeyore’s
ceremony, she said that even the belated
help was more than she would have
expected.

“It never occurred to me anyone would

help,” she said of her frightening walk
home, “I was hysterical and
disoriented. . . . When a person is
disabled, dealing with insensitivity is a
daily hurdle.” .

«a: Q “ m.—._- I _ .

g. By Bunny McBride
" Mia! to The Christian Science Monitor
Pare National dos Volcans, Rwanda
OB CAMPBELL stood in a narrow
. mountain pathway of the mist-

shrouded forest, camera pressed to

his nose, focusing his lens on a 400-

pound male “silverback” gorilla vora-

ciously consuming a bamboo tree.
The great ape was so close that Mr. Campbell and
his ﬁve companions could hear every crunch.

As he stood enthralled, Campbell felt a heavy
' hand on his shoulder. Expecting it to be one of his
travelrnates, Campbell spun around - only to ﬁnd
himself face to face with a pair of luminous brown
eyes set in a massive black patent-leather face.

The 300—pound silverback, which had been pa-
tiently waiting to pass, gently turned the tourist
and slid by.

For Campbell and the others, experiences like
this were a sublime reward for the torturous 2%-
hour climb up the lush, slippery slopes of
Rwanda’s Visoke Mountain. Such encounters are
. on the rise in a region known as the Virungas
’ ecosystem, a string of fertile, mile-high mountains
that straddle the borders of Rwanda, Zaire, and
" Uganda in central Africa. Here live nearly 300 of
N. the world’s 400 mountain gorillas. And here exists
' a novel tourism industry aimed at preserving
these powerful, yet unaggressive, primates.

Mountain gorillas are one of the most endan-
gered species on earth. There are no early ﬁgures
on their population, but from 1960 to 1981 their
numbers in the Virungas plummeted from about
500 to 242. (An estimated 100 more live 15 miles
north, in Uganda’s Impenetrable Forest).

The gorillas, live in stable polygamous family
groups and have no natural enemies. Other than
humans. Humans have usurped their habitat for
farming, sold them to zoos and research labs, and
murdered them to make sculptures with their
skulls or ashtrays with their hands.

. During this decade, there has been a dramatic ~

turnaround in the sorry fate of these creatures, ::
particularly those living in Rwanda. Major credit :
for the change goes to the Mountain Gorilla Proj-u

ect (MGP), a consortium of international conser-
vation organizations, including the African
Wildlife Foundation and the World Wildlife Fund,

.. working with the Rwandan government.

The project, founded in 1979 and situated in
the Parc National des Volcans, which is Rwanda’s

_ corner of the Virungas, combines three strategies

for preserving the apes. First, it provides regular
patrols to catch poachers, collect snares, and mon-
itor the gorilla population. Second, it seeks to
educate local people about conservation.

The third strategy is where pr Campbell and

- his tourist friends come in. The MGP has created a

unique “gorilla watching” tourism industry in

, Rwanda, which has created a strong economic

incentive for gorilla protection in the country.
There is no doubt that Rwanda’s commitment
to the program is rooted as much in money as in
conservation. Rwanda is the most densely popu-
lated country in Africa, its 5.5 million people
living within 10,000 square miles. Ninety-ﬁve

3 percent of its citizens are peasants, and the coun-

try is an almost uninterrupted patchwork of culti-

;.- grated. hints. exmnt in the Pare National des
Volcans. With increased demand for Iarrruanu,
nearly half of the park was turned over to cultiva-

. tion in 1973, reducing it to about 46 square miles. .

. ‘In the late 19705, farmers living at the base of the

Virungas pressed to obtain even more of the park.

.1 “Researchers like myself and conservationists

familiar with the region knew that further human

I encroachment on the park would inevitably lead

,. to the gorilla’s extinction,” says MGP director
Craig Sholley. “It would also lead to uncontrolled
water runoﬁ' and soil erosion. Most of ‘us felt that

y the only thing that might convince a developing

' country like Rwanda that saving the park and the

g gorillas was important was tourism money. In our

_. view, the only alternative was to habituate gorilla

f Between 1979 and 1983, this plan was carried
s out among four gorilla groups. MGP staﬁ ap-
’. preached the animals on a daily basis, sitting a bit

closer and staying a bit longer each day until trust

was established. '1bday,
tourists, accompanied by " ‘
a ranger-guide, can sit
among these goups in

their natural habitat. '

“In effect, tourists _
serve as a guard force ,
for the gorillas, deterring l
poachers just by their .
presence,” says Russ
Mittemier of the World
Wildlife Fund. ViSitOI‘S , 2.;

out provoking them.
They’re forbidden to
touch the gorillas, but
sometimes contact is un-
avoidable. “I’ve had a
baby jump on my back
and steal an earring,”
says Diana McMeekin,
vice-president of the Af-
rican Wildlife Founda-
tion, “and any number of
people have had their
cameras snatch .”

Last year’s 6,000 visi-
tors generated half a mil-
lion dollars in much-
needed foreign currency 1
through park-entry and ' ~ .
gorilla-watching fees. When the charge for visit-
ing the gorillas doubles this year, to about $145 a
person, the annual intake will jump to $1 million.
With money spent on gas, lodging, food, and sou-
venirs, gorilla-watching has become a
multimillion—dollar enterprise. In fact, according
to Mr. Sholley, tourism is now the No. 2 earner of
foreign capital in Rwanda (after coffee and tea),
“totally due to gorillas.”

 

 

Without the pioneering antipoaching efforts of

the late American zoologist Dian Fossey, there
would probably be no mountain gorillas left to
protect. Dr. F038ey initiated the ﬁrst long-term
study of these primates in 1967 , when she set up
Karisoke Research Station on the remote 10,000—

foot-high saddle between Karisimbe and Visoke 4
Mountains. A new biography by Farley Mowatt .2

(“Woman in the Mists") describes Fossey’s. err—f

; traordinary research and rancorous struggle to
save the species. Her efforts to protect them from
poachers was heroic, at times frantic. She once
went so far as to kidnap the son of a poacher and
burn the belongings of his family.

.In 1977, following the brutal slaying of Digit, a
beloved gorilla that Fossey had had contact with
Since his birth 10 years earlier, she launched the
Digit Fund, a successful international campaign to
support antipoaching foot patrols within the park.
But Pbssey’s passion for the well—being of the
mountain gorilla was so intense that she alienated
other researchers, locals, and park and govern-
ment ofﬁcials. On Dec. 28, 1985, she was mur-
dered, and the Rwandan government tried and
convicted in absentia her assistant, Wayne
McGuire. It is speculated, however, that she was

killed b poachers or by someone contracted by
RwandaEii officials who saw her as a roadblock to
) the lucrative gorilla tourism industry.

, Indeed, Pbssey did not
i even ' endorse the
founding of the MGP, be-
cause she was concerned
that its multiple activi-
ties would divert atten-
tion and funds from her
single—minded aim to
halt poaching. Yet, the
MGP appears to have
made a profound contri-
bution to Fossey’s goal
'- of gorilla preserVation.
With the new Fossey
biography and a forth-
coming Warner Bros.
ﬁlm about her (starring
Sigourney Weaver),
ggrowing numbers of
', tourists will no doubt be
i drawn to Rwanda. Will
3 increased demand result
' in an exploitation of the
E gorillas? “We won’t al-
it low it,” says Sholley.
‘ “Only six visitors are al-
; lowed to visit each of the
' four gorilla groups for
, just one hour a day. . . .
. Not that people don’t
suggest abuse. At least
twice a day I’m asked to
increase the size of the tourist groups to seven.
But I say no, because we can’t afford to
destroy the gorillas’ tranquillity.” .

But, given the economic needs of. Rwanda and
the tempting proﬁtability of gorilla-watclung,
there’s no guarantee that Sholley won t be cor-
nered into at least an occasional yes. When re-
cently pressed by the Rwandan government to
habituate a ﬁfth gorilla group for tourists, the
MGP staff complied. It did not, however, succeed
in habituating the target group. .

Beyond these pressures, there remain unstaved
fears that contact with humans could present
grave health problems for the gorillas. Shirley
McGrail, director of the International Primate Pro-
tection League in Summerville, 8.0., is concerned
about gorilla tourism as it is now conducted, be-
cause “it is not 100 percent safe for the gorillas, '

jr’ who are vulnerable to' human parasites and

' viruses. Everyone visiting them should be forced
to wear face masks and carry plastic bags to pick
up their own waste . . . and it should be mandated
that they bring evidence that they have tested
negatively in the standard tuberculosis test.”

Dr. Sy Kalter, a leading diagnostician of simian
viruses in the United States, corresponded with
Fossey on this very issue just before her death.
“I’m in a very small minority [among
primatologistsl,” he says, “but I’m against the
tourism. If it could be set up so observers were at a
distance, that would be one thing, but this“crawl—
ing around among the gorillas at a close distance
could spell disaster.”

In April, 13 gorillas in one group came down

- with colds, stirring concern among the research—
, ers. According to Ms. McMeekin of the African

 




Wildlife Foundation, Who stays in close touch
with MGP staff, “It is not likely that there is a
r connection between tourists and the gorillas’ sick-
ness. They always get colds at the height of the
rainy season, and this year it has been unusually
chilly and very rainy.” She adds that the MGP
usually avoids giving medication to the gorillas;
but, with such a signiﬁcant number ailing within
one group, two veterinarians were called in to
observe the gorillas and dart them with anti-
bodies. Afterward, “they were carefully watched
for several days, and I received a report that all of
them are recovering,” says McMeekin.

. Clearly, tourists need to be educated about
possible negative eﬁ‘ects of their privileged associ-
ation with the mountain gorillas. Meanwhile,
MGP’s eifort to educate Rwandans about conser-
vation has been highly effective. According to
Sholley, “In the early 19803, when asked if it was
important to save [Parc das Volcans], 60 percent of
the public surrounding the park said, ‘No, we
want to use the land for our [gardens].’ Now 70
percent are adamantly in favor of saving the park.
They understand that it is their "water supply,
their protection against erosion, and that the go—
rilla tourism has provided lots of jobs for locals.”

The MGP’s antipoaching patrols have also met
with success. In the decade before the creation of
the MGP (and the Digit Fund), about 15 gorillas a
year were killed in Rwanda. Echoing Fossey’s
efforts, MGP and Rwandan park personnel
equipped and trained antipoaching patrols that
continue to thwart and arrest poachers and to
uncover thousands of snares. (Snares that poach—
ers set in the park to catch small antelopes have
long been perilous for gorillas.) Since 1983, not
one gorilla has been poached in Rwanda, and the
population there has slowly begun to rise.

The next step in the conservation drive is to
halt poaching and habitat destruction in Uganda
and Zaire, which contain much of the range of the
gentle gorillas. In 1984, Zaire established a project
modeled on the MGP, and in 1986, Uganda set up a
similar project in its Impenetrable Forest.

But these programs are not yet successful. A
recent visitor to Nairobi spied a squat-shaped
wooden sculpture with a curious head in the
window of one of the many shops that sell native-
produced crafts. She went into the shop to ask
about the origins of the ﬁgure, and discovered it
was from Zaire. The head of this sculpture was a
.- gorilla skull.

Dog keeper faces charges in raid

5 84 animals found in filth at Washington County building

Germantown -- A 78-year-
old woman whose 84 dogs were
seized when they were found
Friday in squalid conditions has
been ordered to appear Monday
before the Washington County
district attorney. ,

The woman faces charges of
improperly housing the poodles
and Yorkshire terriers in small
cages in a fetid, feces-filled, 20-
by-20-foot building at N132-
Wl7303 Rockfield Rd., German-
town, the Washington County
Sheriff’s Department reported.
The woman lives in the Jackson
area. \

The dogs remained in the care
of the Washington County
Humane Society in Polk.

“It was an absolute disgrace,”
said Phyllis Cook, director of the
humane society. “No one’s going
to convince me that this woman
cared about those animals.”

The woman has been raising
dogs on the property for more
than three years, Cook said. She
also kept dogs on at least one
other location in Washington

_—-—b—-———- — —«....

County and in Milwaukee, Cook
added.

She said operators of such
facilities, which she termed pup
py mills, usually referred to
themselves as “commercial
breeders.”

Joined by Cook and a veteri-
narian, deputies arrived at the
Rockfield Rd. property . with a
search warrant at 9:30 am. Fri-
day, Sheriff’s Lt. Michael Hetzel
said. ‘

They had been alerted by the
owner of a neighboring small-en-
gine repair shop. The shop’s
owner complained earlier in the
week that the stench from the
building with the dogs was driv-
ingcustomers away.

“When we brought them out,
the animals gasped for air,” Cook
said. “The people had to go in
and out [of the building] to stand
it.”

Inside, deputies found the
dogs — some pregnant, some
infected and many dirty —
locked in cages stacked three-

high, Hetzel said.

Cook said some of the dogs
had swollen paws from standing
on the thin wire of the cages.
Some dogs were cut and some
had infected teeth, she said, and
the cages had not been pr0perly
cleaned. "

“I have .a problem believing
she didn’t know any better than
to keep them like this,” Cook
said.

A man who once rented a
milk house to the woman for dog
breeding said Friday that she had
kept the cages clean but that the
dogs had suffered from lack of
ventilation.

Mark Puls, owner of B.J.’s
Tavern in Richfield, said that
when he rented to the woman 10
years ago, she had taken good
care of the dogs, often helping
deliver the puppies.

But the cages in which the
dogs were kept were very small,
and poor ventilation made it dif-
ficult to breath in the milk house,
Puls said. He said the woman
rented from him for two years.

“—ngA THE MILWAUKEE JoonuAL Baturdaz. E are, 1988 _
Rare Bengal tiger dies

Chandar was popular Zoo attraction

 

The world’s population of white
Bengal tigers was diminished by one
Friday when Chandar died at the
Milwaukee County Zoo.

Chandar, one of the Zoo’s most
popular attractions since he was
acquired in 1984, and one of only
about 90 white Bengals in the world,
was 7 years old. Bengal tigers nor-
mally live to be 15 or 16, Zoo spokes-
woman Laura Pedriani said Satur-
day.

The blue-eyed, black-and-white-
striped tiger became lethargic last
week and was found to have pancre-
atitis, a malfunction of the pancreas
gland. The pancreatitis led to liver
damage and kidney failure.

Chandar stopped breathing about
4:45 pm. Veterinarians tried to
resuscitate the animal for 10 minutes,
Pedriani said.

Dadra, Chandar’s mate, has been
“nervous and upset” since Chandar
was taken to the Zoo’s animal hospi-

tal last week, Pedriani said. The nor-
mally active 5-year-old female, who
displays the conventional Bengal
black and orange stripes. has refused
to come out of her indoor enclosure
for several days.

Zoo officials have not yet decided
whether they will try to replace
Chandar, who did not have offspring.
Because of their rarity, white Ben-
gals are expensive. Chandar and Dad-
ra were purchased from the Cincin-
nati Zoo for $60,000.

Pedriani said that about 150 peo-
ple called the Zoo Friday to inquire
about Chandar’s condition. Signs will
be posted in the feline house to

explain his death, but no other plans .
have been made for a memorial, she ,

said.

The first white Bengal was not
captured until 1951 in India. Indians
considered it to be a representative of

a kindly god, and thus a good omen.

Atlanta ape
to go outside
after 27 years

By Mark Mayﬁeld
USA TODAY

 

 

ATLANTA — Willie B., a

450-pound silverback gorilla,
will step into the sunshine to-
day — after spending 27 years
in a concrete cage. .,

And with him go the dreams
of Atlanta’s zookeepers, who
are quickly turning around
what was listed among the na-
tion’s 10 worst zoos in 1984.

Improvements costing $30
million have boosted atten-
dance 46 percent in two years,
to 80,956 in April.

Willie B.’s new home is a
$4.5 million rain forest, four
acres of wilderness where
moats hold in the gorillas.

“The whole trick is to get
him used to change,” says Tim
Desmond, a Los Angeles ani-
mal behavioral consultant
who’s helping the zoo move

 

TO THE GREAT OUTDOORS: Atlanta zoo’s Willie B. has lived in a
concrete cage since he was plucked from the wild 27 years ago.

Willie B.

“I’m amazed at how normal
Willie B. is given that he’s been
in the same room for 27 years.”
It was the only place available.

No one knows how he’ll re-
act outside. Says Charles Hor-
ton, his trainer of 14 years:
“Birds ﬂying over might fright-
en him, or a helicopter could
scare him. He’ll be looking at
things he’s never seen.”

The rain forest will open to
the public June 11.

 

. Ap

Joining Willie B. this sum-
mer will be three families of
other gorillas — 13 altogether.
He hasn’t seen another gorilla
since he was taken from the
wild 27 years ago.

The rain forest is separated
into four areas, allowing Willie
B. personal space.

Eventually, trainers hope
Willie B. will socialize with oth-
er apes. Says Desmond:
“There’s no reason why he
should remain a bachelor.”

In Texas: Stalking the Western Diamondback

R ancher Bill Haas turns up the heat
against the chilly morning as he
waits, ﬁrst in line. for the Nolan County
Coliseum in Sweetwater. Texas, to open
at 8 am. In the back of his brown-and-tan
Ford pickup are 1,042 lbs. of live rattle-
snakes. Behind him sit ten more trucks.

snakes, venomous Western diamond-
backs. are reluctant participants in what
has become a rite of spring in rural Texas:
the rattlesnake roundup.

other hunters will sell them for $3 a lb. at
Sweetwater’s 30th Annual Rattlesnake
Roundup. The town’s J aycees. who orga-
nize the roundup as a community fund
raiser, claim that of some 40 in the coun-
try, theirs is the largest and oldest. draw-
ing crowds of 8,000 a day. They expect to
clear about $40.000 from the take at the
door and the sale of skins, meat and
venom.

“We had 5.000 lbs. of snakes turned in
before noon the ﬁrst morning. a total of
11.709 lbs. for the whole roundup." says
John Womble. a carpenter who has been
weighing snakes for twelve years.
“They’re brought in U-Hauls so they
don’t freeze. We don‘t buy dead snakes.
They come loose in horse trailers where
we’ve got to get in and pick “em out. in 55-

mid of hard keratin nubs. acquired at the
tail after successive moltings. The cease-
less, disturbed rattling of so many snakes
together is like the sound of bacon frying
in a hundred Skillets.

The three-day roundup is as much
carnival as hunt. It begins with a parade
down Sweetwater‘s Broadway (antique
cars; the Girl Scouts Troop No. 114 ﬂoat:
the Sweetwater High band; Dr. Michael
Dainer. the town ob-gyn. with his Clydes-
dale and buggy; the Nolan County sher—

which 21 of the town’s young women vie
for a scholarship prize of $1.000 and the
title Miss Snake Charmer.

Inside the coliseum. spectators can
watch snake handling by professional
snake wranglers. There is also snake
milking. butchering. gutting and skin-

coats. Three-dollar bus tours for those
who want to see the snakes in their natu-
ral habitat leave every hour. A cook shack
is busy producing corn dogs ($1) and
deep-fried rattlesnake meat ($1). Take a
bite; it tastes like turtle.

At the milking pit. Mike Brentz. a
burly offshore oil worker. lifts a snake
from a garbage can and places it on a
small center table. Carefully he ﬂattens
and immobilizes its head with a hook and
picks it up just behind the jaw. He hangs
the snakes fangs over a glass beaker.
When he squeezes. a teaspoon of venom
drips out. Then he walks around the pit
giving spectators a close-up of the snakes
satiny pink mouth. its curved fangs. black
tongue. When Kelly Head. 19, the new
Miss Snake Charmer. gets into the dem-
onstration pit with Bill Ransberger. the
snake handler. and picks up a snake. her
hands shake a little. “Beauty and the
beast." pronounces Ransberger. as the au-
dience applauds. “I always look for a little
cold snake with no others around,“ she
conﬁdes.

In the IGA parking lot near the coli-
seum. a guided hunt is being organized.
Participants have paid $29 for registra-
tion and for hunting equipment—snake
tongs and hooks made from recycled golf
clubs. a snakebite kit. hand mirrors. gar-
bage cans to hold live rattlesnakes and a
spray can with a long c0pper tube ﬁlled
with unreﬁned gas for ﬂushing the snakes
from their dens. This is the snake-hunt—
ing-as-a-sport group. and its members
come from as far away as Canada. Hunt-
ing garb ranges from Reeboks and jeans
to paramilitary Indiana Jones attire. in-
cluding boots with a side knife and scab-
bard. camouﬂage ﬂak jackets. molded—

plastic' snake-proof leggings. “Some of ,

these folks are really into serpents." says
Wayne Wilson. a Jaycee and hardware-
store owner.

Bo Browning leads the expedition. It
moves down Interstate 20 in a 20-car-
and-camper caravan and into the still
brown land of broomweed and tumble-
weed. thorn trees and mesquite and
prickly—pear cactus. Browning has been
hunting snakes since he was 14. always

with the same high school friends. His +

wife Brenda accompanies him. "It‘s
something we can do together." she
says. “It‘s exciting. the thrill of not
knowing. the danger. Bo hunts snakes
like some people hunt deer. for the
sport.“ “He‘s good.“ says a friend. “He
just smells them.“

The group is cautioned about ﬁres and
littering. and then scatters. A few less ex-
perienced hunters trail along behind Bo.

A PROPHECY by the artist LS. Lowry is
about to come true for a 66-year-old
Manchester woman ﬁghting to save an
animal sanctuary, writes Peter Watson.

Mrs Grace Cleworth and her daughter,
Mrs Hazel Wilkinson, have run the sanc-
tuary at Moston Brook Farm, on the city
outskirts, since the 1960s. It houses some
30 ponies, donkeys, sheep, goats and cats.

It is virtually surrounded by a North
Western Regional Authority sewage tip
that has ﬂooded at least once a month in
the last three years, sometimes as much as
3ft to 4ft deep, forcing raw sewage on to
the farm and attacking the eighteenth cen-
jtury farmhouse, says Mrs Wilkinson.

. Mrs Cleworth and her husband met
".‘iLowry in the 1940s. Over the years he
i {used to drop in on Saturday mornings for

the valley with sewage.

With Lowry’s help the Cleworths put up
a spirited resistance and in 1975, 10 days
before they were due to be evicted, their
home became a Grade II listed building.

Lowry had given the family two paint-
ings of their house, and added a third.
Mrs Cleworth says he told her: ‘They
won’t forgive you, not Manchester. You
have cost them money, and Manchester
City Council don’t forgive people who do
this to them. Take this painting and when
your back is against the wall, sell it and
the others and get as much money for
them as you can.’

Mrs Wilkinson said: ‘We need to raise

£200,000 at least to pay for the house to be
rebuilt, or for a house and land elsewhere.’

Dog lovers Should learn to fancy cats

CHICAGO—Dog lovers (especially Terry
Loncarie, The observer, May 7), go ahead and
raise your hackles. You’re not going to like what
I’m gorng to say.

Dogs are smelly slobs that would sooner jump
against your leg than give you the time of day.

A cat won’t drag its sloppy tongue all over your
face. A cat shows its affection by quietly sleeping
at the foot of your bed, or by giving you a soft,
dry “kiss” on your face.

A. dog lover will argue that a cat is a snob. .
While it’s true that a cat will not slobber all over
you to show affection, at least it understands its
place in .the universe. It isn’t particularly its privacy, it will offer unassuming friendship for
demanding. You can scratch it under the chin and the length of its days; it never will jump on you
feed it a bit of chicken, and you’ve got a friend for with muddy paws or dig up your ﬂowers.

SPORTS ILLUSTRATED — May 23, 1988

I ABUSED HORSES
Thank you for the story Bad Time for
Wild Horses (April 25). The whole mess
started because cattlemen, who pay a
very small fee to the government for the
right to graze their herds on public
lands, do not wish to share these lands
with the mustangs. If it were up to them,
they would slaughter every last horse.
MARCIA K. GREEN
Bellmore, N. Y.

What’s wrong with marketing animals
for slaughter? I am from North Dakota,
raise cattle and am proud to be a beef
producer. Does that mean something is
wrong with me? I think not. The bleed-
ing hearts of America, along with the
BLM [Bureau of Land Management]
have created this problem of overabun-
dance. Now they feel we taxpayers
should pay for their mistake. The gov-
ernment should gather the excess horses
and sell them. This would prevent any

more senseless and catastrophic results
such as occurred at Minnewaukan Flats.
MARK J. VOLL

Dickinson, N.Dak.

Kudos to Bill Nack on a well-written
presentation of a subject that has to be
one of the most highly-charged and
emotional issues Congress has ever tack—
led. Abusers of the system make sensa-
tionalized coverage a temptation. SI‘s
journalistic principles led it around this
trap, and your readers received a bal-
anced account of the dilemma.
Administering the wild horse pro-
gram in a manner acceptable to the
Congress. the public and the courts,
without shirking our core land-manage—
ment mandates, has been my most vex-
ing problem during seven years in this
job. That’s why, on March 1, I took the
unusual step of asking Congress to hold
oversight hearings into my agency’s car-
rying out of the 1971 Wild Free-Roam-

ing Horse and Burro Act as well as on
the law itself. Some observers saw my
request as the issuance of a challenge. I
saw it as a simple call: “Help!”

The unanswered question of what to
do with excess horses must be resolved.
BLM spends 26,000 tax dollars a day on
hay. As a taxpayer, I can’t help but
think that there are a few more urgent
domestic needs for some of that mon-
ey—like school lunches for needy kids.

I hope that Congress will lend BLM a
hand by focusing on the issue, so that
palatable solutions can be found.

significant and should be consid-
ered.

Obviously, as Fort Bend County
grows in human population, the
animal population will grow even
faster. Approximately 500,000
dogs and cats will inhabit Fort
Bend County by the end of this de-
cade and this is a conservative esti-
mate. Not all of these animals will
be blessed with nice homes and re-
sponsible owners. Many will be
abandoned, homeless and eventu-
ally killed on a busy highway or die
of a disease agent. Some survivors
will form packs and terrorize
neighborhoods, becoming health
hazards and nuisances to the com-
munity. City and county animal
control agencies are usually poorly
funded, understaffed and are not
facilitated for the humane care of
animals.

What’s the answer? Very simple.
The citizens of Fort Bend must ac-
knowledge the need for an animal
welfare shelter by providing sup-
port in every possible way they
can. The Fort Bend County Hu-
mane Society (FBCHS), a relative-
ly small group of dedicated volun-

teers, has worked d1l1gently for the
past 10 years to make the county a
little better for its animal inhabit-
ants. They have worked with limit—
ed resources and a very small bud-
get, yet their accomplishments are
numerous. But, as so often hap-
pens, Fort Bend has outgrown this
group of dedicated servants. Be—
cause of expanded growth and in—
sufficient funds, they find it practi-
cally impossible to “keep up.”

So they have solicited assistance
from other animal welfare agen-
cies, including the Houston Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to An-
imals (HSPCA). After several plan-
ning meetings, the HSPCA board
of directors agreed to merge the

With a little assistance from

“Even though we are a long way .

be optimistic as we know that the
people of Fort Bend county really
care about animals and they know
that a shelter in our county is des-

Puppy gets breath of life ‘

Teacher revives girl’s pet, carried in book bag

Eau Claire, Wis. —AP— A teach-
er who used mouth-to-mouth resusci-
tation Wednesday to revive a pupil’s
2-week-old puppy said she learned
the technique during her childhood
days on a farm.

Alice Meyer, a third grade teacher
at Pedersen Elementary School in
Altoona, revived the dog after it lost
consciousness inside the closed book
bag of a first grader who had
brought it to school to show to other
children.

“I haven’t done that since I grew
up on the farm, which was a long
time ago,” said Meyer, who said she
sometimes had to revive newborn
calves on her family’s farm.

Jessica Ellison arrived at school
eager to show her puppy to class-
mates. But when she looked inside
the bag, the puppy, a huskie-mala-

mute mix, appeared lifeless.

“By the time we opened it, the
little puppy was suffocated. We
thought it was dead for sure,” Meyer
said.

Jessica stood by and watched as
Meyer administered the life-saving
technique for more than 15 minutes.

Jessica’s mother, Mary Ellison,
said she was unaware the girl had
taken the puppy to school until she
was called by school officials. Ellison
said the puppy was returned home
for some milk and seemed to be
doing fine. '

Meyer said Jessica’s mistake pro-
vided for one of the most unusual
experiences in her 20 years of teach-
ing.

“The lesson for the day,” she said,
“is all living things need air.”

Dear Mr. MOntgomery:

Something has just come to my attention which greatly upsets and disturbs me,
and I hOpe you will take steps to see that the matter is rectified.

For untold years I have been reading of the dedication of one Dorothy Richards
to our fellow creatures of the woods and forests. I had admired her for her
fight for the rights of all animals.

I also understand that a wealthy Philadelphian, Florence Erdman (also an ad-
mirer of Dorothy Richards), left over a million dollars in a trust with your
bank, to support sanctuaries where animals could "remain unmolested”, and
people could come and learn about wildlife preservation - not hunting and
trapping.

Now I have just read that an avid hunter and trapper by the name of watkins
was hired to work at the Sanctuary and run it, and that the foreman is also
an avid hunter and trapper. These two fine women mmst truly be "rolling”
around in their graves.

Could it be that your bank does not understand the meaning of sanctuary, or
that it does not understand the instructions of Florence Erdman?

To me, this is a gross miscarriage of Florence Erdman's instructions, and
certainly those of Dorothy Richards who fought so hard to protect animals.

I sincerely hope that so well-known a bank:as the Mellon in my hometown of
Philadelphia, will take steps immediately to see that both of these mis-
guided individuals are removed from the Sanctuary without further delay. I
’ am sure there are dozens of people who would be only too happy to see that
the wishes of these two ladies are carried out.

It continues to boggle my mind the meaning hunters and trappers put on the
words "Refuge" and "Sanctuary". Of course, it could be lack of education,
but they should certainly be made to understand what these two words mean.
Phy'I hear from you on this matter.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Dear Mr . Montgomery:

On March 18, I wrote you re Beaversprite Sanctuary
in Little Falls, NY.

As of this date I have not had the courtesy of a
reply. That either indicates you were swamped with
mail protesting your handling of the matter, or one
of your employees has not shown you my letter.

The Animal Rights movement in this country is not
going to go away; it is growing by leaps and bounds -
the more people realize how animals are being treated.

We are not a group of nuts, or little old ladies in
tennis shoes. I am an executive secretary for a most
prestigious ad agency, and I have been gainfully em—‘
ployed for 51 years. I don't consider myself a little

Will you please have someone at your bank extend me
the courtesy of a reply to my letter (copy enclosed).

Thank you .

Boom time: QMOY Scattish industry

The dangers mount as luxury ﬁsh farming runs

Whole waterways had to be poisoned to
kill the ﬁsh, the only means of eradicat-
ing the parasite.

compound, was banned last year. But
the industry could not survive without
Nuvan which is used to kill sea-lice.
Nuvan, which has to be handled with
care by farm workers, can also damage
lobster and crab larvae in some concen-
trations. Research is needed, says Dr
James Munford, a former ﬁsh farmer,
now adviser to the Nature Conservancy

. Council.

0 Predators: Hungry seals, herons,
cormorants and shags are attracted to

. ﬁsh cages. The Marine Conservation

Society reported last month that on 47
ﬁsh farms they surveyed, 206 seals had
been shot and 113 drowned acciden-
tally in predator nets. On rough esti-
mates 1,050 seals, 200 herons, and
more than 2,050 cormorants and shags
are killed each year on salmon farms.

ODisease: Both other farmed stock

and,_worse, wild ﬁsh are affected. A

cautionary tale comes from Norway,

where imported Swedish salmon carry-

ing the helminth parasite cross-

infected .wild salmon in 20 rivers.
‘ ‘ s- ‘ ‘

Loch Leven, near Fort William, with some of its 52 cages

The Department of Agriculture for
Scotland relies on the fact that Britain’s
laws on the transport of ﬁsh are much
stricter than Norway’s.

OGenetic dangers: The risks from
cross-breeding with wild ﬁsh have only
recently been understood. Farmed
salmon are usually a Scottish/Norwe-
gian cross. But unwanted smolts have
been eagerly bought and released in
hundreds of thousands by fishery
managers.

Two kinds of smolts are produced in
freshwater salmon hatcheries: S],
which turn to smolts after a year, and
82 which take two years and are
thought unsuitable for ﬁsh farming.

Releasing unwanted 82 ﬁsh into riv-
ers is a dangerous practice, according
to Dr Peter Maitland of Stirling Fish
Conservation Centre. Each Scottish
river system appears to have evolved

Loss of life: a seal caught in farm nets

out of cOntrol

salmon with a genetic make-up best
suited to that river. Genetic dilution
could drastically weaken the wild
stock.

As salmon breeding becomes more
scientiﬁc, it will be able to breed more
placid salmon which cannot cope in the
wild. And the dangers of releasing
these will increase.

0 Scenery: Local planners in Highland
Region are concerned about uncon-
trolled blocks of ﬁsh farm cages in such
sensitive tourist locations as Loch
Leven, near Fort William, in the Ben
Nevis and Glen Coe National Scenic
Area, and at Loch Sunart, where 200
cages are planned.

Councillors are concerned that the
Commissioners do not always take
their advice or consider the roads and
shore bases that farms will need, and
local planners are left to pick up the
pieces. The Convention of Scottish
Local Authorities is calling for plan-
ning control over salmon farms to be
placed in local authority hands.

 




DAILY TELEGRAPH - London, England - May 16, 1988

' Scottish salmon hatch

Charles Clover warns that a failure
to control salmon farming could
seriously affect Scotland’s trawler
trade, wildlife and landscape

ANGER OVER Scotland’s fast-
est growing industry, salmon
farming, boiled over last
month in Mallaig harbour, on
the West Coast. A local trawler
skipper — seething after per-
mission had been given for a
salmon farm in Loch Nevis, a
winter ﬁshing ground — block-
aded a ship carrying‘large con-
crete slabs to the loch.

Skipper Tony Lewis flung
furious words at reporters
about the remoteness and
“incompetence” of the Crown
Estate Commissioners who
grant licences for develop-
ments below the tide line, in
this case to the Atlantic oars-
man, Tom McLean.

The London-based Commis-
sioners, from their small
branch office in Edinburgh,
had approved a farm marked
on an Ordnance Survey map,
without reference to fisher-
men’s charts.

Communities in the High-
lands and Islands are torn over
the breakneck expansion of the
salmon farming industry —-
estimates predict a £100 mil-
lion a year turnover by 1990.
Salmon farming brings year-
round jobs: about 500 have
come to the Highlands alone
since the late Seventies.

The pace of development has
been remarkable. From 500
tons a year of luxury salmon
ﬂesh in 1979, the industry pro-
duced 12,700 tons last year and
will reach 50,000 tons a year by
the end ofthe decade.

Nearly every sheltered sea
loch today has its raft of
salmon cages. But local
people, authorities and conser-
vation groups and even salmon
farmers have frequently united
to complain about the secre-
tive way in which the Crown
Estate Commissioners dispose
of tidal sites.

Few would deny that a prop-
erly managed fish-farming
industry could be one of the

least damaging ways of bring-
ing wealth to the Highlands
and Islands. But the concern is
now, as Neil Jamieson of the
Scottish Scenic Trust declares
emphatically, that “the devel-
opment of salmon farming is
out of control. ”

In the past few months a
growing pile of reports has
shown that this rapid expan-
sion has not been .achieved
without devastating cost to
unique scenery, water quality,
traditional fishing activities,
and wildlife including the wild
salmon.

Scottish Wildlife Link and
the Nature Conservancy Coun-
cil say that salmon farming has
developed far in advance of
existing research and controls,
although the industry itself -—
particularly its leading lights.
Marine Harvest, a Unilever
subsidiary, and Booker
McConnell —-— has been more
responsive to public pressure
than the Scottish Secretary,
Malcolm Rifkind.

“We would like to think that
salmon farms are put only into

V areas where there are other

significant wildlife p0pula-
tions,” says Rawdon Goodier
of the NCC in Scotland. Unfor-
tunately, that has not always
beenthecase.

At the root of the problem
are the Crown Estates Com-
missioners’ consultation pro-
cedures or. rather, lack of
them. The Commissioners are
both developers and the licens-
ing authority. In 1986 they pro-
duced a list of guidelines but
these failed to satisfy their
critics.

The Commissioners who
have a small staff, do not pub-
lish the reasons for their deci-
sions, or allow appeals. They
are unable to produce an upto-
date map of where ﬁsh farms
are. That information, they
say, is secret.

The farmers themselves

harm for the

Highlands

have no strong affection for the
present procedure which
requires them to apply to. three
authorities: the commissmners

- for a sea-bed lease, local plan-

ners for shore installations,
and the river purification

, board for pollution consents.

The NCC, alongwith the
Countryside Commissmn for
Scotland and the National

' Trust for Scotland, is calling

for a new planning framework
for fish farming. These
demands are given urgency by
a new EEC law, due to come
into force on July 3, which
demands an environmental
assessment of “significant”
developments deemed to be
potentially damaging.

Malcolm Rifkind has yet_to
decide what size a “Signiﬁ-
cant” salmon farm might be.
The Scottish Office continues
to examine the evidence; but it
will have to move with unac-
customed speed to comply
with the law by J uly.‘

IMMEDIATE and long-term dangers
include:

Pollution: Fifty tons of salmon
r.equire 100 tons of pelleted food each
year, 20 per cent of which falls to the
seabed, along with ﬁsh faeces. The
effect is similar to that of human sew-

age outfall.

Fouling of the ocean bed is localised
to around 50m from the site, but
becomes progressively worse in areas
without strong tidal ﬂow until it affects
the growth of the salmon and the cages
have to be moved. The salmon industry
is developing sturdier cages which can
be moored further out where the tide
washes detritus away more thoroughly.

More vigorous currents could also
improve the texture of farmed salmon
— which has been criticised by gour- '
mets. But there are limits: salmon in
shallow cages in a swell are inclined to
be seasick, believe it or not.

”Airport facility a base for rising exports

By J. Michael Douglas

 

OF THE HOUSTON POST

If travel broadens horizons, then
Houston’s big airport has helped bring
culture to thousands of cows, horses and
other beastly trekkers.

Hundreds of farm animals pass

‘ through the Texas Department of Agri-
culture’s animal export facility at Hous—
ton Intercontinental each month, and an-
imals on the wing are on the rise, officials
say.

“Livestock shipments are up 60 per—
cent this year from 3,178 in 1987," says

jBill Ainsworth, spokesman for the city of

Houston’s aviation department.

“Currently, we’re shipping 1,900
sheep and 600 rabbits to India,’ he says,
“and that shipment alone Will exceed all
of our 1986 numbers.”

Moreover, plans are afoot to make
Houston the nation’s fourth import facili—
ty for horses, officials say, further in-
creasin traffic.

The gdvantage to quick flightsaboard
big jets rather than slower, shipboard
transportion is reduced wear and tear on
the cargo, Ainsworth says.

“Last fall, 200 Brahman cattle were

shipped to Bangkok, Thailand,” he

- says. “All survived the trip.” . .
. The state-operated export fac1h-
’ .tyat Intercontinental is one of only
four such operations in the nation.
The others are in New York, 1.05
Angeles and Miami, says Sam Win-
= kelmann, veterinarian for the US.

Department of Agriculture. .
~The facility’s duties include in-
specting large animals before over-
seas flights, making sure they’re
«healthy and comfortable before

takeoff.
“We verv seldom have to turn

 

anything away,” Winkelmann
says. “We just check to make sure
they’re in good shape and are load-
:ed in a humane manner.”

.. * The latest sheep shipment — a

breed called Rambouillet — and
the rabbits, were scheduled for
shipment this weekend on two Fly-
ing Tigers cargo planes chartered
by Air India, Air India spokesman
~A.V. Hardiker, said.

;‘ j“The government of India has

several sheep farms, and these will
be distributed for breeding pur-
poses to increase wool and meat
production,” Hardiker says.

' The fate of the rabbits is a mys-
tery, he says. “I’m not sure what
they plan to do with them.”

“While large farm animals are the
'stbck-in-trade at the facility, some
less pedestrian species have also
passed by the inspectors’ watchful
eyes, Winkelmann says.

“Several years ago, a Fort Worth
company stocked a zoo in Seoul,
Korea, and those animals were
shipped through here,” Winkel-
mann says. “They had a Noah’s
Ark on that plane: leopards, rhi-
nos, alligators and a bit of every-

“thing.” -

Of late, however, the facility is
seeing horses in increasing num-
bers.

' The weak dollar arid the poor
eCOnomy here have made Texas a
'happy hunting ground for Europe-
~ans looking for deals on quarter
“horses, experts say.

Ainsworth says-

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, says.
Currently, large animals leave

the country through Houston, but

Incoming horses have to stay in
quarantine at least seven days, so it
requires a fair amount of space to
accommodate them.

“The only three places they can
import horses right now is Los An-
geles, New York and Miami be-
cause it’s so involved and expen—
sive,” Winkelmann says.

With cattle, prone to foot-and~
mouth disease, the situation is
more complex. They have to be
kept in quarantine for six months,
and the only authorized import site
is the Harry S. Truman Import Sta—
tion in Key West, Fla.

“The main concern is keeping
foot-and—mouth out,” Winkelmann
says.

However, there are no restric-
tions on horse imports, and several
private companies are interested in
importing them through Houston.

One of those firms is Animal
Port-Houston/Petmobile — a reg-
istered, “pet hostel” that currently
handles inbound and outbound an-
imals from penguins and snakes, to
research monkeys and miniature
horses.

The firm is working with the
USDA to secure an import facility
here, company president Tom
Schooler says, and the firm has
blueprints on the boards for an air—
port facility that would accommo-
date inbound horses. Interest is al-
ready running high among horse
shippers, Schooler says.

“We already have orders lined
up for the next two years, mostly
from European countries,” School-
er says. ,

Meantime, officials are concen-
trating on securing government li-
censing for the facility. “It’s a
tough thing dealing with politicians
and federal agencies,” Schooler

 

While waiting, the firm is meet—

. ing the challenges of caring for oth-

er travelers in transit. Some of the
care instructions left with family
pets are unusual, he says.

“Some want their pets to watch
game shows or soap operas,”
Schooler says.

“I guess they feel like they want
first-class service for their ani-
mals,” Schooler says. “So we give
them what they want.”

 

 




CHICAGO TRIBUNE - May 18, 1988

IFur trappers hunting

l

By Howard Witt
Chicago Tribune .

LONDON—It certainly seemed a
sure-ﬁre idea. Indian and Inuit fur
trappers from Canada’s far north,
bar: high by sophisticated British attri-
rm —rr ts campaigns against e
fur trade, decided to pitch a teepee
msrde the enemy camp.

They sponsored an exhibit at the
British Museum’s venerable Muse-
um of Mankind that depicts what
life is like for Canada’s modern-day
native people, complete with a tent,
a log cabin, an igloo and all manner
of artifacts and pictures designed to
show the depth of their dependence
on hunting and trapping.

In an understated way, the exhibit
was designed to be as persuasive
and compelling as the graphic an-
tifur campaigns waged by British
animal welfare groups, the most
dramatic of which wiped out the
Canadian seal fur industry several
years ago when the world was
shown shocking ﬁlm footage of
baby seals being clubbed to death.

Europeans, the Canadians h0ped,

might begin to understand the con- ~

sequences of their antifur cam-
paigns on the well-being of im-
poverished Indians.

But things have not gone accord-
ing to plan.

No sooner did the exhibit open in
December than the British govem-
ment announced its intention to
enact a new labeling law long
championed by the antifur move-
ment. It would require garments
made from animals commonly
caught in controversial leg-hold

traps to state that fact expliciﬂy,’

something the animal rights groups
hope will be a tumoﬁ‘ to prospec-
tive fur buyers.

The leg-hold trap, said by animal
welfare groups to cause extreme suf-
ferin and death by starvation, is
wide y used by Canadian natives.
But Canadian natives do not vote
in British elections.

“There is clearly in this country a
lot of support for a label regulation
like this,” said Glenn Fisher, a

spokesman for Trade Minister Alan ;
Clark, who proposed the new law. '

“It is not aimed at destroying the
Indians’] livelihood. It’s aim at
providing consumers with necessary
information.”

As if the labeling law weren’t
trouble enough, it seems many of
themore than 100,000 museum
visitors who have gone through the
“Living Arctic” exhibit may be
missing its subtle pro-fur pomt.

in vain for sympathy

“People don’t seem to be making
the wnnection between the exhibi—
tion and the animal-rights issue,”

' said Jonathan King, curator of the

exhibit. “If that is what the
Canadians] hoped for, it’s not
pening.” '

And the exhibit has stirred the
redictable scorn of the animal wel—
are groups.

“It’s really quite a propaganda ve-
hicle,” said Mark Glover, director
of a British antifur group called
Lynx that has led the ﬁght for the
labeling law. “It’s an extremely
smart stra

fur-trapping and then make it look

like the animal-rights groups are
threatening them. But I suspect the 7
British public is not as gullible as g

the fur industry takes them to be.”

The Canadian natives are taking '

all this philosophically, preferring to

'- stress the long-term public sensitiza-

tion they hope will result from the

exhibit, which has been attracting

record crowds to the museum and
will run for another year.

But they are clearly disappointed.

“They are targeting the most vul-
nerable people ﬁrst with this la-
beling law, but we are optimistic
that this thing is not going to beat
'us down,” said Cindy Gilday, a
Dene Indian and spokeswoman for
Indigenous Survival International,

. the Canadian native group that or-

ganized the museum exhibit and
raised $400,000 toward its cost.
Most of the money came from the
Canadian government.

“Before, most Europeans didn’t
know a thing about how we liv ,”
she said. “Now they know that
there is a living, breathing, thriving
Indian culture in North America
with people who hunt and ﬁsh and
trap to make their living.”

Like it or lump it, “Living Arctic”
is an attention-grabbing show, espe-
cially for Europeans who have long
idealized North America’s Indians.
Divided into sections devoted to the
lives of Canaria’s distinct Arctic and

. sub—Arctic peoples, the exhibit

features a Cree teepee, a full—size

Madison’s Vilas Zoo to get

2 Alaska polar bear cubs

Anchorage, Alaska —-—AP—
The Vilas Park Zoo in Madison,
Wis, will get two polar bear
cubs that have become the star
attraction at the Alaska 200 since
their mother was shot on the
coast of the Bering Sea.

Three-month-old brothers
Nanook and Norton will be given
to the Vilas 200 late this month
or early in May, according to the
US Fish and Wildlife Service.

The Alaska Zoo in Anchorage
is temporarily sheltering four
recently orphaned polar bears,
but the zoo already has its own
polar bears and doesn’t need
more.

“We wanted to keep [Nanook
and Norton] together, because it’s
in the best interest of the twins,
both biologically and emotional-
ly,” Fish and Wildlife Service
spokesman Bruce Batten said
Thursday.

But “two adult males is a
whole lot of bear” for one 200 to
handle, he said, so one of the
animals will be sent to the zoo in
Providence, R.I., after a year in
Madison. .

“The bears need an opportuni-
ty to interact with anOther of

their own kind in infancy,” ’Bat-
ten said. That will help them deal
with a zoo environment later, he
said.

Nanook and Norton were
transported to Anchorage March
29 after a native hunter stumbled

onto their den and was forced to

kill their mother. A week later,
two more cubs, Kobuk and Chuk-
chi, were sent to the zoo after an
Eskimo hunter mistook their
mother for a young male and
shot her. They will be going to
the Indianapolis 200, the service
said.

“We’ve been soliciting offers
from responsible, accredited,
worldclass type facilities,” Batten
said. Among other things, the
bears have to be in a place with
cool shelter and plenty of water.

The four are healthy, have
been gaining weight and draw
crowds to the Alaska Zoo, where
“they scrap and play like any
little kids,” Batten said.

The polar bear at the Madison
zoo was recently destroyed after
injuring a man who entered its
cage. Officials there have sought
a replacement since.

When school is a zoo

Student zoo keepers gain experience in addition to degrees

By L. M. Hendricks
Special to The Christian Science Monitor
Galnesvllle, Fla.
IGHTY Santa Fe Community College stu-
dents enjoy working with animals so much
that they take most of their college
courses in a zoo.

They are enrolled in the college’s Zoo Animal
Technology Program, he ﬁrst of only three such
programs in the United States. Students are
trained as zoo keepers or for related careers in
zoological parks. Conservation and protection of
wild species are emphasized.

The ﬁve-semester program takes 18 months to
complete. In addition to 25 hours of general educa-
tion courses in English composition, math, and the
sciences, the student zoo keeper learns about ani-
mal nutrition, animal breeding, manunal culture,

the deer family, 28 kinds of exotic birds, and
reptiles and amphibians (some deadly poisonous).

“There are diﬁerent management styles for dif-
ferent animals,” says Brown. “We select the ani—
mals here in the teaching zoo according to the
experiences the students will get from them.”

Students quickly learn whether they are suited
to the occupation. As Brown notes, “Our job out
here taking care of animals can be very dirty and
grubby. We have to let everybody know that’s part
of it. A lot of peeple come in with the mistaken idea
that there’s a lot of hand-feeding, touching, and
cuddling of animals. There’s very little of that. A
lot of the work is manual labor.”

“After the ﬁrst semester, the students really are
zoo keepers. They do all the cleaning and mainte— . ...
nance, the medical work on the animals, behav- _
ioral observations, and hand-raising, if necessary.” . . . ‘ '

herpiculture. According to Jack EDUCATION is no different for student zoo keep- ‘

A zoo keeper’s job is demanding; it

 

Brown, the general curator and a
teacher, these classes are not fresh-
man—level courses, but are taught on a graduate
level.

“Years ago,” says Mr. Brown, “a zoo keeper was
considered a janitor. Zoo keepers aren’t janitors
anymore. They’re scientists. You have to have
somebody to do the maintenance kind of things -
feeding and cleaning - but you have to have some-
body who can observe behavior, who can think
about animal nutrition, who can think about every-
thing involved in the animal’s environment. That’s
what our program specializes in.”

A major beneﬁt of the Santa Fe. program is the
l4-acre zoo that is right on the school campus. Here
students acquire the experience necessary to land
a job after graduation.

Among the 224 specimens, there are 74 species,
including peccaries (vicious South American ani-
mals that look like pigs), several kinds of wild cats,
primates, Arctic foxes, rock hyraxes, members of

ers. Their days begin with rounds at 8
am. and end about 5 pm. In addition
to their regular studies, zoo courses, and hands-on
duties in the zoo, they serve as tour guides for
more than 10,000 elementary school students ev-
ery year, an activity that gives the zoo keepers
valuable experience in working with the public.

Another important function of the zoo is animal
rehabilitation; in particular, the treatment and re-
lease of endangered species. At least 20 injured
eagles have been treated at the 200, as well as
countless other animals. Rehabilitated animals are
returned to the wild whenever possible. ' ' .- ,, j ,. , ,

Dear Connie:

Thank you for writing me concerning the recent vote by the House
Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries on H.R. 3601, the National
Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Act.

H.R. 3601 is a bill relating to the enhancement of the Nation's
fish and wildlife resources and the National Wildlife Refuge System.
This bill was introduced on November 3, 1987 and jointly referred to
the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs and the House
Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries. As you know, the Merchant
Marine and Fisheries Committee voted 28 to 13 on May 3 to pass this
legislation. However, the bill remains before the Interior and
Insular Affairs Subcommittee on Water and Power Resources. I have
enclosed a copy of the bill for your review.

As I have said before, I agree with you that we must protect our
environment in trying to meet our nation's energy needs. However, at
this time, I am continuing to study the different proposals before
Congress concerning the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. While I am
not a member of the committees that have jurisdiction over these
bills, I will carefully review the committee report and, of course,
keep your opinion in mind before deciding my position on this
important issue.

Again, thanks for staying in touch.

With best regards, I am,

PLS/at

Wild horses deserve humane handling

Roaming free across windswept plains, wild
horses have always symbolized the rambunctious
spirit of the Old West. Lately, they’ve .come to
symbolize something else: a humane policy gone
awry. It will take prodding by animal welfare
activists and' Congress to correct federal neglect of
a program to find homes for the horses. .

At least 7,000 wild mares, colts and stalhons are
penned in federal corrals around the country, the
legacy of a 16-year effort designed to round up the
critters and prevent them from damaging public
lands leased by Western cattle and sheep ranchers.
The horses are available for adoption to.anyone
willing to pay up to $125 each, but adoptions are
dwindling and many of the animals are simply
given away to ranchers who apparently sell them
to slaughterhouses.

Meanwhile, the feeding bill for the penned
horses, amounting to more than $7 million a year,
has prompted one Reagan administration official to
ask: “When we’re cutting programs for”the poor,
should we be feeding excess wild horses?

A government with its priorities in order would

e to ask such a question; both wild horses
23d mr people would get decent treatment. The
real issue is: How did such a well-meaning pro-

falter? . .
graMnuch of the blame lies with the adrmnistration,
which has made only halfhearted attempts to
encourage horse adeptions. That could be correc-
ted by publicizing the program more aggressrvely.
The government should also be more selective
about the kinds of horses it rounds up; older,
infirm and hence less adoptable animals should be
left on the range. Doubtless that would anger some
ranchers, but their claim on public lands does not
entitle them to crowd out all other users. And it s
unlikely that broken-down horses pose much of a

t to ran e land anyway.
thrlefa all othger remedies fail, renewed calls for
euthanasia might have more credibility. But that
option, which the government thus far has
shunned because of public disapproval, should not
be considered until the more humane alternatives
have been exhausted. Wild creatures deserve a
better fate than being churned into dog food.

Falcon fly-in

Older peregrines drop in Downtown

 

By ELIZABETH CULOTTA

of The Journal staff

 

The falcons are here again.

Only they aren’t the ones
released in Downtown Milwaukee
last summer.

Two adult peregrine falcons,
older than any released in Milwau-
kee last year, were spotted this
week flying outside the 16th floor
of the First Wisconsin Center, 777
E. Wisconsin Ave., said Greg Sep-
ton, Milwaukee coordinator of the
Department of Natural Resources
falcon release program.

“We don’t know who they are,
but they’re not our birds from last
year,” Septon said.

, Last summer, 14 young pere-
grine falcons bred in captivity
were released from atop the First
Wisconsin Center. Peregrines once
roamed Wisconsin, but their num-
bers have dwindled. The Milwau-
kee release was part of a national
program to reintroduce the
endangered birds of prey to their
native areas.

Ten of the birds released in
Milwaukee survived, and falcon
program officials eagerly are

watching the skies for their '

return. .

The birds seen Tuesday are at
least 2 years old and are probably
from one of the other Midwestern
release sites: Chicago, 111.; Detroit
or Grand Rapids, Mich.; Minneapo-
lis or Rochester, Minn.; or Winni-
peg, Manitoba, Septon said.

Falcons are migrating now, and
the pair could be transients, just
passing through Milwaukee on
their'way to other cities, he said.

On the other hand, if these two
falcons decide to stay in town,
they could start Milwaukee’s first
wild peregrine nest in many years.

Septon said he hoped that the
falcons would choose Milwaukee
as a nesting site. If they do, he’ll
curtail further releases of young
birds this summer. Falcons are ter-

ritorial and no more than one nest-
ing pair will occupy a given area.

He expects the birds will decide
whether to stay or go by,the end
of this month. I‘”

it’s apparently. too early in the
spring for a falcon’s fancy to turn
to thoughts of love and nesting.
Instead, the peregrines were seen
soaring on updrafts from the First
Wisconsin building, catching prey
and just hanging! out, Septon said.

,7 When Children
Experiment With Rats

The Post reported that, as a
classroom project, some sixth
graders experimented on two
baby rats; one animal died and
the other—the one that had
been fed an abnormal diet of po-
tato chips and other human junk
food—became listless, trem-
bled, lost weight, and its nor-
mally lustrous white hair be-

" came yellowed [“The Survival

: of the Unfit,” April 23].

1 What did those 12-year-

. olds learn from this amateur

= experiment? Did they really

" learn to change their behavior

and spurn junk food—the pur-

ported objeetive of the lesson?
Probably not. There is no in-

dication that this frequently re-

peated project, which for over

three decades has been a popu-

lar science fair project, has per-

suaded youngsters to give up

junk food. Perhaps the lesson

learned was that, in the name of

science, it is all right to hurt and

possibly kill sentient animals for

 

trivial reasons.
I object to these nutritional
' deprivation projects by
youngsters. Each time such
needlessly repetitious pro-
jects are conducted, animals
suffer. In my view, these pro-
jects harm both the children
and the animals and are un-
sound educationally.

It’s not that I am against all
animal experiments. I believe
that when conducted by profes-
sionally trained scientists to ob-
tain knowledge that will benefit
human health, some animal ex-
periments are justified. But
these junk food experiments by
children are not justifiable and
should be stepped.

Pets Offer Strokes of Success

 

PETS, From Cl

“It’s a nurturing experience most
inmates have never had. I have
seen them sit up all night with a
sick animal. It’s wonderful to see
Aubria Johnson talk to his fish. He
forgets about the rest of the world,”
Strimple said.

Indeed, while visitors were in his
dorm room, Johnson, 52, convicted
of second-degree murder in 1978,
got on his knees, stuck his face
close to the aquarium at the foot of
his bed and talked to his jewel fish
named “Red Devil,” a ﬂat critter
dressed in shiny pink scales, and
another fish, “Runner,” who sports
-bold black stripes.

“He’s a showman,” he said, point-
ing to the jewel.

“He likes cameras. He comes to
the glass and poses. Isn’t that right,
man?” Johnson said, tapping the
aquarium with a finger.

In the six years he has been in
the pet therapy program, Johnson
has raised an array of fish. “I sent
Oscar home to my mamma and dad
because he got too big,” he said.

His first fish, called “Junior," died
some years ago. Johnson embalmed
Junior with alcohol and water,
buried him in a bottle and held a
small funeral in his honor attended
by at least five other people.

The pet therapy program has
turned men who never liked cats
into cat owners and pet owners,
Johnson said.

“It’s something they can love.
They become an attachment, like a
family. It has even brought about
new relations between the guys in
the area where there are pets,”
Johnson said. “When I was in the
hospital for a month and a half, the
guys in my area not only fed my
fish, they also cleaned the tank.”

Steven Roberts, owner of a bird
named “Jerry,” recalled when he got
his first bird. He was so afraid that
the cats would bother it that he left

 

his prison job every chance he got
to check on it.

“Once I trained him, I could let
him fly out and he would come right
back and get in his cage,” said Rob-
erts, 30, who is serving time on an
armed robbery conviction.

Charles Hinnant, 35, incarcer-
ated on a drug charge since 1984,
joined PAL a year ago and now has
a cat named “Bosworth,” after Brian
Bosworth, a Seattle Seahawks line-
man. It has been a while since he
has seen his other pet, a cat named
“LT.” after San Francisco 49ers
lineman Lawrence Taylor.

Extremely ill animals must be
sent to Strimple’s outside animal
hospital for treatment. Occasion-
ally, a pet disappears, and often, the
men say, the pet has been given
away or sent to someone who took
a liking to the animal while it was at
the hospital. But a hospital spokes-
man said animals who “are owned
or spoken for” generally are re-
turned to Lorton. But the men do
not like to lose their animals.

“They always tell us, ‘We found
him a home,’ ” Johnson said mock-
ingly. “What do they mean? He ale
ready had a home.”

Baby birds are given to members
of 4-H clubs to raise a bit longer
before giving them to people at
nursing homes. Last week, there
were 11 bird eggs in two nests in
the PAL office.

It is Conyers, the cat-calling man,

who is in charge of care for all of ‘

the animals in the office. He
patches them up when they are in-
jured and watches over 15 birds,
one rat, three mice and a kitten,
who is allowed to romp around the
room.

“I’m the godfather of all the
pets,” said Conyers, who is also
PAL president. Conyers," 40, who is
in Lorton on a burglary conviction,
calls all of the animals “Pee Wee.”

“That way, I get all of their at-

Lorton’s Pet Project Tomes Loneliness
Veterinarian Helps Inmates Find Caring, Responsibility With Animals

 

By Patrice Gaines—Carter

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

Every day about 8 am. and again about 10 p.m., in-
mate Michael Conyers stands in the courtyard at the
Lorton Central Facility and yells, “Pee Wee! Pee Wee!”
He dumps small servings of dry cat food onto the con-
crete, and a herd of cats—no one keeps a count—-
prances across the grass to stop at his feet and nibble.

For six years the ritual has been going on, since the
day veterinarian Earl O. Strimple started. the pet ther-
apy program at the DC Department of Corrections
facility in Lorton. Incarcerated men are allowed to keep
pets in their dorm rooms or cells, and the men can take
classes on animal care that prepare them for jobs later.

Strimple, prison administrators and inmates say the
small rats, mice, fish, birds and cats who now live at
Lorton have filled large voids in the hearts and minds of
, the men, some of whom had never known what it meant
to be responsible for anyone or anything.

“I think it gives a guy a chance to do something on his
own,” said Strimple, who believes that contact with pets
helps humans physically and emotionally. “These men
know if they don’t take care of the animal, it won’t do
well.”

For his pioneering work in the human-animal bond

. an, >-'

Steven Roberts’ pet bird “Jerry" plucks a seedme its owner’s mouth. The Lorton program

field, Strimple, also founder and partner of MacArthur
Animal Hospital in the District, received the national
Bustad Companion Animal Veterinarian Award Thurs-
day. Pet therapy is becoming common in nursing homes
and hospitals, but Strimple said he knew of only four
prison facilities that have some type of pet programs.
When he arrived at Lorton, he discovered that inmates
already were caring for about 500 stray cats, feeding
them smuggled table scraps. ' ‘

Those smuggling days are gone. Strimple structured
a formal program of care, and now about 60 inmates
hold meetings of the Lorton chapter of People-Animals-
Love, a national organization the veterinarian founded.

graduates who found jobs in the animal care field when
they were released from Lorton.

ans was by any deﬁnition an ex-
ceedingly clever horse. Accord-
ing to reports in the Berlin news-
papers around the turn of the
century, he was good at math,
could identify musical intervals and had
working knowledge of German. His owner,
Herr Wilhelm von Osten, had only to ask
him a question. If the answer was a num-
ber, Hans would tap it out with his hoof.
Otherwise, he’d gesture with his head to-
ward an appropriate picture or object. The
local cognoscenti were understandably
skeptical about all this, so they assembled a
panel that included two zoologists, a psy-
chologist, a horse trainer, even a circus
manager, to investigate. Yet when these
gentlemen came face to face with the horse,
they could not ﬁnd a hole in his story. Hans
ﬁelded questions with amazing grace, and
not only from Herr von Osten. If a perfect
stranger were to request the square root of
16, Hans would shoot back with four taps.
But there’s more to the story. Following
the commission’s report, a young psycholo-
gist named Oskar Pfungst set out to see how
Hans would do if questioned by someone
who didn’t know the correct answers. And
he made an arresting discovery: though
Hans succeeded on nine out of 10 problems
if the interrogator had the answers, his
score dropped to just one out of 10 if the
interrogator was ignorant. Hans hadn’t
learned math, music or German after all.
Further studies showed that he had learned
in effect to read people’s minds, by monitor-
ing subtle changes in their posture, breath-
ing and facial expressions. So keen was his
sense of these cues that informed question-
ers couldn’t conceal them if they tried.
Hans could almost always tell when it was
time to stop tapping or moving his head.
The scientiﬁc community was not

amused—it declared Hans an
impostor and treated the whole
affair as proof that animals,
though they may appear to
think, can do no more than re-
act. The idea that animals live
by reﬂex alone was already well
entrenched at the time (René
Descartes had championed it
nearly 300 years earlier), and it
remained a sort of credo among
scientists throughout the ﬁrst
half of this century. But things
have changed during the past
fewdecades.Todaythe question
of what animals know is in-
spiring a wealth of serious
research—and there’s growing
evidence, both from the lab and
from the ﬁeld, that they know a
great deal. No horse has yet
masteredsquareroots,butcrea-
tures as different as pigeons
and primates are dazzling sci-
entists with their capacity for
thought. Comparative psychol-
ogists have gone from wonder-
ing whether apes can compre-
hend symbols to detailing the
ways in which they acquire and
use them. Other scientists are
documenting similar abilities
in sea mammals. Still others are ﬁnding
that birds can form abstract concepts. The
news isn’t just that animals can master
many of the tasks experimenters design for
them, however. There’s a growing sense
that many creatures—from free-ranging
monkeys to domestic dogs—know things on
their own that are as interesting as any-
thing we can teach them.

All of this raises questions about our own
place in the scheme of things. “For thou-
sands of years humans have believed that
they are the only creatures capable of
thought,” says Herbert Terrace, a psychol-

ogist at Columbia University. Admitting
that we’re physically descended from, and
related to, other species has been hard
enough. The implication of the new re-
search is that even our minds are part of
an evolutionary continuum. Thinking, it
turns out, is not a special power that sets us
apart from the rest of nature but a biologi-
cal adaptation we happen to share with
much of the animal world. Animal-rights
activists see a profound moral message in
this (page 59). Scientists, by contrast, see
the possibility of a deeper understanding of
ourselves and the world. By exploring the

 




 

nuances of other creatures’ thought proces-
ses, we gain a new perspective on our own.
We see how we’re different, and how we’re
not. We see, in a sense, who we are.

0 animal excites our wonder quite

as the chimpanzee does. Its

hands, its eyes, its manner all

suggest what its genes conﬁrm:

that it’s very nearly
human. The most obvious men-
tal difference between chimps
and children is that chimps
don’t pick up human lan-
guages—at least not spoken
languages. Early this century,
a few pioneers tried teaching
captive chimps to speak Eng-
lish or Russian and concluded
upon failing that the language
barrier simply couldn’t be bro-
ken. But during the late 19605,
researchers started ﬁnding
that if they used visual signs
instead of speech, chimps did
surprisingly well. First there
were Washoe and Sarah. By
1971 Beatrice and R. Allen
Gardner had taught Washoe, a

young female, no fewer than 150 hand ges-
tures in simpliﬁed American Sign Lan-
guage. Around the same time, the psychol-
ogist David Premack taught a chimp called
Sarah to communicate with metal-backed
plastic chips that could be stuck to a mag-
netic board. Later, in a project directed by
Herbert Terrace, a male named N im
Chimpsky (after the linguist Noam

DAVID WALBERG

Chomsky) weighed in with his own 132-sign
vocabulary. Duane Rumbaugh, mean-
while, of Georgia State University and the
Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center
of Emory University, trained a chimp
named Lana to communicate by touching
geometric symbols, or lexigrams, on a com-
puter keyboard.

In each of these projects, the chimps
learned to associate signs with
particular objects or actions.
Premack, for example, used a
blue triangle as the word for
"apple.” To forge a connection
in the chimp’s mind, he would
set both the plastic chip and
the apple on a table and coax
the animal to stick the chip to
the magnetic slate. If she com-
plied, she got the apple. Once
Sarah had learned which signs
went with which foods, Pre—
mack had the trainers start
wearing plastic chips as name
tags. If a trainer whose sign
was a red square placed an ap-
ple on the table, Sarah would
have to choose a red square
and a blue triangle from a col-

lection of chips and stick both
to the board—with the square
above the triangle—to get the
apple. Later, he introduced
signs for "Sarah” and ”give”
and assigned each a special
place in the sequence. Little by
little, Sarah learned that to get
an apple, she had to line up a
sequence of four signs: “train-
er,” "give,” "apple,” “Sarah.”

he question, as many of
the early researchers
framed it, was not
"What aspects of lan-
guage can a chimp ac-
quire?” but simply “Can a
chimp acquire language?” And
when the animals started
assembling statements like
“Mary give apple Sarah,” they
concluded the answer was yes.
The chimps, like human chil-
dren, seemed to be combining
words to express thoughts.
During the mid-’70s, anything
seemed possible. But then critics, including
some of the researchers themselves, took a
clOser look at the data.

First there was the problem of syntax. As
Terrace pointed out in 1979, there’s a big
difference between memorizing strings of
signs, as the chimps had done, and master-
ing grammatical rules that enable you to
form an inﬁnite variety of meaningful sen-
tences from a ﬁnite number of words. The
chimps had, on occasion, come up with
what seemed like spontaneous, meaning-
ful statements, as when Washoe signed
"More drink” or when Nim declared "Ba-
nana eat me N im.” But Terrace found no
evidence that any of the chimps knew the

 

difference between “Nim eat banana” and
"Banana eat Nim.” A chimp that says such
things is not talking, he concluded. It’s~
"running on with its hands until it gets
what it wants.”

Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, of the Yerkes
center and Georgia State University,
raised the more basic question of whether
the chimps even understood that signs car-
ry meanings. Long before children start
forming sentences, she noted, they learn
that words can be used to represent objects
not present in. time or space. The chimps
had clearly learned to associate signs with
objects and to pair them correctly in return
for rewards. But no one had shown that this

was anything more than a conditioned re-
sponse. No one had demonstrated that a
chimp, in addition to producing the correct
sign to get the banana on the table, could
conceive of the sign as a representation of
an ideal banana.

By the early 1980s, it looked as though
Washoe, N im, Sarah and the others would
go the way of Clever Hans. Chimp lan-
guage research lost its popular appeal,
funds grew scarce and scientists started
turning their attention elsewhere. But
Duane Rumbaugh and Sue Savage-Rum-
baugh persevered. In a project they’d
started during the late ’70s at the Lan-
guage Research Center, a joint venture of
Yerkes and Georgia State University,
they zeroed in on the problem of symbolic
representation. And with the help of two
chimps named Sherman and Austin, they
have since dispelled any doubt that apes
can really understand signs.

Sherman and Austin started with the
same basic training as the other chimps.
But having learned to pair certain forms
with certain objects, these two were gradu-
ally steered toward tasks that would be
impossible without the knowledge that
symbols have meanings. In one particular-
ly telling exercise, Sherman or Austin sits
in an empty room with a screen that ﬂashes
an occasional sign for an object. Having
seen the sign, the animal has to scamper
into a separate room stocked with objects
and pictures and bring back whatever was
named on the screen. The Rumbaugh team
discovered that the chimps not only re-
trieved the correct objects—~a clear indica-
tion that the signs carry speciﬁc meanings
for them—but came back empty-handed if
the named object wasn’t there.

 




Sherman and Austin weren’t necessari-
ly any smarter than the chimps in the earli-
er studies—any one of whom might have
mastered the same tasks, given the chance.
But they were the ﬁrst to demonstrate con-
clusively that an ape can do more than run
on with its hands. In more recent studies,
the two have gone further, showing that
they not only understand the meanings of
symbols but can use them to pass informa-
tion between themselves. In one exercise
they sit before a tray ﬁlled with different
foods and take turns placing orders with
each other. If Sherman signals by touching
keys on a lexigram board that he’d like
some M&M’s, Austin picks them from
among the dozen or so foods on the tray and
divvies them up more or less equitably (a
gesture he acquired only through relent-
less training). They continue this way until
the whole spread, from sweet potatoes to
soda pop, has been devoured.

In a separate project, Savage-Rumbaugh
and her colleagues have introduced the lex-
igram board to several bonobos, commonly
known as pygmy chimps and uncovered yet
another aspect of human language ability:
the power to pick up words by observation
rather than plodding formal training. Rose
Sevcik, a Georgia State graduate student
who has worked on the bonobo project since
its inception in 1979, recalls that Matata, a
wild-born female who started training at
the age of 14, was slow to pick up on the
system. But there was a surprise when the
researchers took her out of the languagelab
and started working with her son Kanzi,
who’d spent his ﬁrst two years playing at
her side. "Much to our amazement,” says
Sevcik, ”we discovered that Kanzi had
learned everything we’d been trying to

 

teach Matata.” Within a few
weeks, Kanzi was using the
board not just to request foods,
drinks and games but to show
off his virtuosity. Having asked
for an apple, he might take a
bite, throw it on the ﬂoor and
later touch the “apple” key
again before gleefully stomping
the remains into mush.

None of this is to say there aren’t impor-
tant differences between apes and trainers.
There is still no clear indication that any
ape understands syntax, the principle of
sentence formation that gives human lan-
guage such versatility and power. As Pre-
mack points out, even an ape that learns
the difference between “Mary give apple
Sarah” and "Sarah give apple Mary” may
never realize—as any child does—that a
particular thought can be expressed in
more than one way. But the Yerkes studies
have shown that language is not an all—or-
nothing phenomenon. An animal may lack
syntax but still use symbols to convey
meaning. Whether that constitutes lan-
guage depends only on how narrowly the
term is deﬁned.

t probably shouldn’t surprise us that
our closest animal relatives share
one of our key mental capacities. But
if symbolic thought is not a uniquely
human franchise, neither is it the
exclusive domain of primates. Lou Her-
man, a professor at the University of Ha-
waii, has taught captive dolphins not
only to read hand gestures but to respond
correctly to the gestures in sentencelike
combinations they may never have seen
before. And Ron Schusterman, of the Uni-

versity of California, Santa Cruz, is now
documenting similar abilities in the
smaller-brained sea lion.

For the past three years, Schusterman
has started his days by driving down the
dirt road to the Long Marine Laboratory,
a complex Of Quonset huts and small ce-
ment pools set amid the seaside tractor
farms outside Santa Cruz. As he arrives on
a recent spring morning, his research as-
sistants have already set out the video
camera and a bucket of raw herring.
Rocky, at 13 the oldest of his three Califor-
nia sea lions, is barking eagerly at them to
get her training session under way. After
a dozen or so water toys have been scat-
tered in the pool, graduate student Becky
Hardenbergh dons a blindfold (to keep
the animal from reading any unwitting
glances she might make) and takes a seat
at the edge of the pool. Then, with Rocky’s
chin resting on her foot, she ﬂashes two
hand signals—one for "ball” and one for
"over.” When she withdraws her foot,
Rocky takes off like an underwater mis-
sile, whizzing past pipes, cones, cubes,
discs and bottles and breaking the surface
just in time to sail gracefully over her
target. She returns with equal gusto to
collect payment in the form of a ﬁsh.

As the 40-minute session proceeds, the

NEWSWEEK:MAY23,1988 55

 




trainers start adding modiﬁers
to the objects they name.
They may, for example, set out
a toy collection that includes
four different cubes and then
signal ”Small black cube ﬂip-
per-touch,” meaning "Find the
small black cube (not the large
black one or either of the two
white ones) and touch it with
your ﬂipper.” This much is
kid stuff. The really difficult
commands are the ones that
designate a relationship be-
tween one object and another.
According to the system Rocky
has learned, "Ball disc fetch”
means “Take the disc to the
ball, ” but "Disc ball fetch”
means "Take the ball to the disc. ”A ball is
not just a ball; it may serve as what Schus-
terman calls a ”goal item” or a "transport
item,” depending on its position within the
command string. To make sure Rocky is
using the rule, and not just memorizing
responses, Schusterman and his colleagues
constantly hit her with new combinations.
Rather than drilling her on "Take the ball
to the disc,” they jump directly to "Take the
small black cube to the Clorox bottle” or
"Take the football to the large white ring.”
Because the signs can be combined in thou-
sands of different ways, each sequence is in
effect a new one.

Neither Schusterman’s sea lions nor
Herman’s dolphins are as good at these
relational tasks as they are at the single-
object variety; Rocky’s score drops from 95
percent correct on the single-object tasks to
45 percent correct on the relationals. But,

in the pool, the odds are exceedingly long of
getting even that proportion right by sheer
chance. Rocky is clearly using rules to de-
code the commands. Whether those rules
amount to syntax doesn’t really matter, as
far as Schusterman is concerned; the fact
that a dolphin or sea lion can comprehend
commands it has never seen before is im-
pressive in itself.

arvard psychologist Richard
Herrnstein ﬁnds it odd that apes
and sea mammals so dominate
the experimental scene; he him-
self has spent more than two dec-
ades working with a humbler species—the
common pigeon—and has shown that it is
just as impressive in many respects. Herrn-
stein studies the overall ability of animals
to form mental categories, and he has con-
cluded that there are ﬁve basic levels of
conceptual ability, four of which can be

found in almost any species.
First is the simple discrimina-
tion of one object from anoth-
er. The second level, which he
calls categorization by rote, in—
volves memorizing the individ-
ual members of a class, as one
would a list of foraging sites
or state capitals. Then comes
open-ended categorization, the
grouping of objects according
to some observable similarity,
so that you recognize not just
a speciﬁc acorn or stoplight
but any acorn or stoplight.
Concepts, which occupy the
fourth tier of Herrnstein’s hier-
archy, are open—ended catego~
ries whose constituents, unlike
acorns, bear no outward similarity. (Ba-
bies, diapers and cribs are conceptually re-
lated, though they look nothing like each
other.) Finally, there are abstract rela-
tions, the use of which enables one to sort
the same group of objects by shape, color,
the number of letters in their names or any
other concept.

Pigeons are undisputed masters of rote
categorization; laboratory studies have
shown that they can memorize the con-

! tents of 300 photographs without begin-

ning to exhaust their small brains. To see
Whether their pigeons could graduate to
open-ended categories, Herrnstein and his
colleagues showed them series of photo-
graphs and rewarded them for pecking at a
button whenever they saw one that con-
tained a member of some generic class,
such as people or trees. The birds not only
mastered these categories, grouping oaks
with pines and recognizing people regard-
less of age, sex or color—they seemed in
some trials to grope toward concepts, as
when they succeeded at grouping rain-
drops with oceans.

Pigeons (unlike chimps or humans) usu-
ally fail even the simplest abstract-rela-
tion problem, such as whether a dot falls
inside or outside an open curve. But at least
one bird, an African Gray Parrot named
Alex, has mastered even this degree of ab-
straction. Under the tutelage of Irene Pep-
perberg, a researcher at Northwestern
University, Alex has learned to identify (in
English, no less) seven colors, ﬁve shapes
and quantities of up to six. It has taken 11
years of training, but he can now look at a
pair of wooden triangles—one green, one
blue—and when asked ”What’s different?”
or “What’s the same?” reply with perfect
diction, "Color!” or "Shape!”

It’s not just in behavioral laboratories
that animals display their cognitive pow-
ers, but also in the wild. In fact, ﬁeld biolo-
gists are ﬁnding that many species’ natural
behaviors are no less complex than the
ones that psychologists are going to such
lengths to teach them. Research has

 




 

shown, for example, that the calls of some
free-ranging monkeys are not just raw ex-
pressions of arousal, as was long assumed,
but fairly detailed news reports about
events in the outside world. Robert Sey-
farth and Dorothy Cheney of the Universi-

ty of Pennsylvania have found that vervet ‘

monkeys in Kenya have at least three dis-
tinct alarm calls—one for snakes, one for
eagles, one for leopards—and that each one
elicits a different response. The vervets
usually scramble for the highest branches
of a tree upon hearing the leopard call, but
take cover on the ground when warned of
an approaching eagle. Harold and Sarah
Gouzoules, of Emory University, have ana-
lyzed ﬁve calls used by rhesus monkeys to
recruit help during their frequent scraps
with one another, and found that a given
scream not only identiﬁes the monkey in
distress but announces whether the ﬁght
has gotten physical, whether the aggressor
is of higher or lower rank and whether it’s a
family member. And as it turns out, each of
these considerations affects the likelihood
that the caller’s allies will get involved.
What’s so tantalizing about these ﬁnd-
ings is the possibility that they’re just
initial glimpses at natural communication
systems that will turn out to be far more
intricate than scientists ever imagined. As
Harold Gouzoules readily concedes, the
recruitment calls he has studied are just a
tiny fraction of the rhesus repertoire—
and it’s conceivable that every sound they
make is equally rich in signiﬁcance. When
you consider that other creatures, from
songbirds to killer whales, have their own
sophisticated vocal systems, the enormity
of what we don’t know becomes apparent.
In fact, says Diana Reiss, who studies com-
munication among captive dolphins at
California’s Marine World Africa U.S.A.,
“there may be something fully analogous
to human language in the behavior of
animals—something that’s not even vocal.
How can we know that all an animal’s
gestures don’t convey information?”

icki Hearne has an even more

radical question. Hearne is not a

scientist but a poet, a sometime

English professor and a trainer of

dogs and horses. She spends her
days in a kennel in rural Connecticut. And
she argues with great conviction that sci-
entists, by focusing too narrowly on cer-
tain capabilities, often miss out on what’s
most interesting about their subjects.
How, she asks, can we presume to declare
any particular ability—whether to juggle
concepts or to communicate with sym-
bols—a general measure of mental abili-
ty? "We make the same errors in thinking
about animal intelligence as we do in
thinking about human intelligence,” she
says. “We assume it’s a homogenous phe-
nomenon. There isn’t just one kind of stuff

that you can put in a bottle and call intelli-
gence. When you deﬁne an animal’s intel-
ligence in terms of its ability to master a
certain concept, you’re projecting the con-
cept into a new territory.”

The point is simply that different crea-
tures live by different forms of awareness.
People may outshine dogs at chess or
mathematics, she says, but we have a
grossly inferior ability to make sense of
the world through our nostrils. (As she put
it in her 1986 book “Adam’s Task,” "Dogs’
noses are to ours as a map of the surface of
our brains is to a map of the surface of an
egg. A dog who did comparative psycholo-
gy might easily worry about our conscious-
ness or lack thereof, the way we worry
about the consciousness of a squid”) By
the same token, dogs have an uncanny
ability to read someone’s intentions at a
given moment, she says, relating a story of
how Scotland Yard once pitted a couple of
Irish wolfhounds against a sharpshooter
(armed with blanks) to see if he could draw
fast enough to shoot them at point-blank
range before they took him down. “He
never got his gun out of the holster,” she
says. "The dogs knew what he was going to
do before he did.”

Dogs have mastered many of the tasks
that interest comparative psychologists.
Bonita Bergin, director of Canine Compan-
ions for Independence, imparts no fewer
than 89 different commands to the dogs she
trains to work with disabled people. They
learn to hit elevator buttons, turn lights on
and off, pick up anything that is dropped
(from dimes to books), even get food out of
the refrigerator. But Bergin is less im-
pressed by the ability of dogs to obey strings
of commands than by the sense of responsi-

 

bility they develop. When something is
dropped on the ﬂoor, she says, a working
dog doesn’t automatically retrieve—it
looks up to see whether the person wants
the object back. That, she says, is intelli-
gence. And that, according to Hearne, is
precisely the sort of thing that scientists
miss out on. “The stuff you can quantify is
not necessarily the interesting stuff,” she
says. “What’s interesting is what happens
to your relationship with an animal as the
training progresses. ‘Sit,’ ‘Come,’ ‘Stay,’
‘Stand,’ ‘Heel’ and ‘Down’ don’t mean the
formal movements . . . What they mean is,
”You and I stand now in a certain relation-
ship to the rest of the world. We consult
each other about things that come up’.”

The thought of a cat helping a human
cross the street is a little like that of a
moose playing fetch. Which is not to say it
lacks intelligence, just that it has different
interests and aptitudes than a dog or a
person. The cat’s legendary knack for
ﬁnding its way home apparently reﬂects
not only a superb visual memory and a
keen sense of smell but an awareness of
minute changes in the earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld; scientists have found that other ani-
mals wearing magnets lose much of their
homing ability. The British animal behav-
iorist Desmond Morris also credits cats
with a vast vocal repertoire. The hissing,
spitting sound they make when cornered
is not just a random outburst, he specu-
lates in “Catlore,” his latest mass-market
pet book, but a "mimicry display” that
plays brilliantly on many an aggressor’s
innate fear of snakes.

eminently reasonable behavior—not just 5

Emptying the Gages

in cats, but in birds, bees and people—

involves no reasoning at all; it’s automatic -

and involuntary, the fruit of countless
generations of natural selection. (Just
watch what your arm does next time you
start to fall down.)

How much of what animals do is inten-

tional, and how much is automatic? Scien- z

tists remain divided on that question.
Donald Grifﬁn, an emeritus professor at
Rockefeller University, has long argued
that few animal brains could even store the
huge volume of hard-wired behavioral in-
structions they would need to survive in
constantly changing environments. Mak-
ing conscious decisions, he says, is far more
economical than carrying around auto-
matic responses for all the contingencies of
daily life. In fact, he wrote in his 1984 book
“Animal Thinking,” "Animals with rela-
tively small brains may . . . have greater
need for simple conscious thinking than
those endowed with a kilogram or more of
gray matter.” Others, including Richard
Herrnstein, consider "consciousness” too
slippery a concept even to talk about scien-
tiﬁcally. Animals obviously respond in
complex ways to the world around them, he
says, but since we can’t directly observe
their subjective experience, there is little
point in speculating about whether it re-
sembles our own.

But even scientists who don’t like to
speculate about consciousness are parting
with the old notion that animal behavior
consists entirely of reﬂexes. There is too
much hard evidence that animals live by
their wits. There’s anecdotal evidence
too—like the story about Jim Mullen, a
trainer at Marine World, who once de-
vised a system for getting his dolphins
to pick up the trash that blew into their
pool. He would stand by the side of the
pool with a bucket of ﬁsh and hand out
rewards for each piece of rubbish they
retrieved. Gradually it came to his atten-
tion that one of the dolphins, Mr. Spock,
was getting all the ﬁsh. So, during a pool-
cleaning session, Mullen had his assistant
keep the treats coming while he walked
down to an underwater window to see
what was going on. Spock, he discovered,
had hoarded a stash of paper bags under a

To their credit, scientists are coming to
appreciate such surprises. They’re ac-
knowledging that while Clever Hans may
not have learned math, the knowledge he
displayed was awesome just the same. And
they’re learning to smile at cartoons like
the one in which Gary Larson depicts three
thick-looking fellows earnestly monitoring
the chatter of two dolphins in a pool. "Mat-
thews,” one of them says to his coileague,
”we’re getting another one of those strange
'aw blah es span yol’ sounds.”

 

 

Does the animal kingdom need a bill of rights?

 

what do you suppose they

think about?

Do they feel fear? Locked in a
laboratory, do they mourn
their freedom? Do they hear
the footsteps in the corridor

If animals really do think,

’ and wonder whose cage they

will stop at this time?

Once, it would have been in—
conceivable to entertain these
questions seriously—but then,
it once was considered idle to
ask similar questions about hu-
man slaves. Today they are cen-
tral to one of the fastest-grow-
ing causes in America, one that
seeks to overthrow the princ:
ples that have governed rela~
tions among the species since
Adam: animal rights.

To those who use animals in
medical research, the questions
above are not just irrelevant
but mischievous, the products
of superstition and egalitarian-
ism gone berserk. Where, they
wonder, will the next genera-
tion of medical miracles come
from? Will science be reduced
to trying to cure cancer it";
vegetables?

To both sides, it is an issue
of great passion and urgency.
Congress has received more
mail on the subject of animal
research than any other topic,
according to Dr. Charles Mc-
Carthy, head of the Ofﬁce
for Protection from Research
Risks at the National Institutes of Health;
the mail runs 100 to 1 against the use of
animals. Just last month, in the midst of
World Laboratory Animal Liberation
Week, as about 150 protesters marched on
the NIH, a counterdemonstration was
called by 60 health organizations to empha-
size the need for animals in medical re-
search. One side makes its case by showing
pictures of baboons with their skulls ce-
mented into helmets for an experiment on
head trauma; the other brings out the
mother of seven-year-old Lilah Koch, the
youngest child ever to receive a pacemaker,
spokesperson of the Incurably Ill for Ani-
mal Research.

The concept of humane treatment of ani-
mals is not new in Western society. The

civilized nations, followed eventually by
the United States. But the laws were in-
tended to protect animals from speciﬁc acts
of cruelty, a concern that animal-rights ac-
tivists now regard as hopelessly out of date.
"Humane treatment is simply sentimental,
sympathetic patronage,” says Michael
W. Fox, director of the Center for Respect
for Life and Environment at the Humane
Society of the United States. The avant-
garde position is that human beings have no
inherent right to utilize other animal spe-
cies. "The animal-rights philosophy is abo-
litionist rather than reformist,” states Torn
Regan, an intellectual leader of the move-
ment. "It’s not better cages we work for, but
empty cages. We want every animal out.”
Activists like Regan are quick to seize on
evidence of animal intelligence. "If it is
true that animals are fundamentally like

ing ability. Every species has its
own capability that allows us to
exist.”

‘lower animals’: Framing the issue in
terms of "rights” is a heritage of the vari-
ous rights movements that preceded it. The
' modern movement may be dated to the
1975 publication of "Animal Liberation”
by Australian philosopher Peter Singer.
He coined the term "speciesism,” by anal-
ogy to ”racism,” to describe mankind’s
traditional attitude toward so-called lower
animals. Yet activists are careful—most of
the time, anyway—not to equate animals
with oppressed human minorities. “When I
say animals should have rights, that does
not mean animals should have the same
rights as people,” says Joyce Tischler, exec-
utive director of the Animal Legal Defense
Fund. Pigs will never be interested in free-
dom of religion, but they might have an
interest in due process—if it
meant remaining alive and not
being chained to the ﬂoor.

The most basic right, pre-
. sumably, is the right not to be
eaten. But the struggle for
now is centered mainly on the
20 million animals in Ameri-
ca’s laboratories, for several
reasons. Much research and
testing is of necessity grue-
some, like the infamous Draize
test, in which substances such
as cosmetics are applied to the
sensitive corneas of rabbits,
causing varying degrees of
damage. Research also is less
central to our culture than eat—
ing, as Tischler was reminded
recently while talking at a

60 NEWSWEEK : MAY 23,1988

 

school, when a sixth grader turned to his
classmates and announced: "You realize
she’s talking about our hamburgers here.”
And there is an informal hierarchy of ani-
mals based on public-relations value. A
group called the Animal Liberation Front
won attention last February when it
stole—or "liberated”—-13 beagles from a
California laboratory. It is hard to imagine
evoking much sympathy with a freedom
raid on, say, a Perdue broiler house.

The research establishment, after years
of ignoring the issue, has begun to take
notice and ﬁght back. "The movement is
slowly strangling research to death,”
warns Frankie Trull, head of the Founda-
tion for Biomedical Research, an organiza-
tion that defends the use of experimental
animals. She says new federal rules, man-

ings,” says Dennis Stark, a vet-
erinarian who is working to de-
velop alternatives to animals for some
research. “It has made people bother to
think about what they are doing.” Scien-
tists are looking for substitutes for the
Draize test and have worked out ways to
test drugs for toxicity that involve less
slaughter than the "LB-50” standard
(ﬁnding a dose that kills 50 percent of a
sample of animals).

Social contract: But perhaps it is time for
the medical establishment to confront the
animal-rights movement on its own terms
and propose its own version of the social
contract. It might start with the observa-
tion that animals derive certain beneﬁts
from their association with human beings,
including their use in medical research; it
was researchers working with cats, after
all, who devised the vaccine against feline
leukemia. In exchange, human
society requires animals for
certain vital purposes and one
cannot reasonably expect them
to volunteer. When society
faced a similar situation with
respect to young men in war-
time, the solution was the draft.
For that matter, horses were. in
effect, drafted to ﬁght in the .
Civil War. Was the use of caval-
ry to ﬁght slavery immoral? Is
the war against AIDS or COro-
nary disease any less impor-
tant? Can we recognize and pro-
tect the interests of different
species—and still call on +11

restaurant’s Iceland connection

Stall Writer

Plcketers rotesting the slaughter of
whales marc ed outside a Fort auder~
dale Burger King on Wednesda after-
noon, but there was no need for iners to
choke suddenly on their Whaler sand-
wiches.

There is no whale in the Whalers. The
sandwich is pure cod.

But the cod comes from Iceland, and
about 40 demonstrators, members of the
international environmental organiza-
tion Greenpeace, were protestin Burger
King’s purchase of fish from Ice and.

Iceland, they contend, kills whales in
defiance of a moratorium imposed until
1990 by the International Whaling Com-
mission, as whales are in danger of ex-
tinction.

The demonstration at the corner of
Federal Highway and Southeast 17th
Street was one of 20 staged on Wednes-
day by Greenpeace activists at Burger
Riggs around the country, organizers
sa .

“I! all the corporations 0t together
and threatened a boycott of Icelandic
fish], Iceland would stop whaling,” said
Bill McCullom, a Greenpeace spokes-
man. “That’s a lot of pressure."

McCullom said Iceland is continuing
commercial whaling while thinly dis-

“If all the corporations

threatened a boycott [of
Icelandic fish], Iceland
would stop whaling,”
“That’s a lot of

guising it as research, which is permitted
under the moratorium.

He said the demonstrators were not at-
tacking Burger King or urging eople to
boycott the restaurants. Instead: he said,
they were requesting the restaurant
chain’s c00peration.

Burger King spokesman Douglas Tim-
berlake, contacted in Northbrook, 111.,
said, “We deal with independent Icelan-
dic fisheries that are not part of the gov-
ernment, and those fisheries from whom
we buy product, through our suppliers,
are in no way involved in whaling for re—
search purposes or other purposes.”

He said dis utes over the killing of
whales shoul be resolved before the
International Whaling Commission.

“We have nothing to do with whaling,”
he said.

The marchers carried an inflatable
whale beach toy, a harpoon, and a vari-
ety of signs. The largest banner, in refer-
ence to Burger King’s “Have it Your
Way” slogan, read: “Let The Whales
Have It Their Way.” Another sign asked,
“What Do Dinosaurs And Whales Have In
Common . . . Nothing . . . Yet.”

A number of passing drivers honked
their ap roval or flashed the thumbs-up
signal. ost diners in the restaurant
seemed undisturbed by the protest, and
some supported it.

“I think it’s a hell of an idea,” said Bob
DeFranco of Fort Lauderdale. “I think 1
they ought not to buy their fish from this
country. I wouldn’t have come in here if I
knew that.”

McCollum had 379 letters written by
third graders at Norland Middle School
in Miami addressed to Charlie Olcott,
president of Burger King. A local manag-
er refused to accept the letters, and
McCollum said he would mail them to
corporate headquarters. They were writ-
ten after he spoke to the class earlier this

ear.

y “Dear Mr. Olcottz” reads one of the let-
ters. “I’m appaled [sic] at the fact that
you are not doing anything to regulate
the killing of Icelandic whales and if you
don’t, I will stop eating at Burger King
and go to McDonald’s instead. Sincerely,
Appaled [sic] Student.”

BOSTON GLOBE - May 17, 1988

Bush says he’d do more

to protect environment

SEATTLE — Vice President
George Bush. apparently seek-
ing to distance himself from
President Reagan's environ-
mental record. yesterday said
the government hasn't done
enough to protect the environ-
ment and promised to do much
more if he is elected president.

Speaking to an issue on
which many Republicans feel
their party is vulnerable this
fall. the vice president said the
government must hasten the
cleanup of toxic-waste dumps.
improve its enforcement record
and pay more attention to pro-
tecting ground water.

Bush - who has made many
of the same points from time to
time as the campaign has pro-
gressed, but never so directly in
one speech — singled out acid-
rain policy for particular criti-
cism, saying the time had come
to stop studying the problem. If
necessary. he said, the govern-
ment must agree to set specific
goals to reduce the emissions
that contribute to acid rain. a
step the Reagan administra-
tion has steadfastly resisted.

Aldermen Approve Dangerous-

By Tim O’Neil
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff .

New regulations governing danger-
ous dogs won approval Friday in the
St. Louis Board of Aldermen.

The board adopted the new dog-
control bill unanimously and without
debate. The aldermen had delayed
passage last week in a prolonged ar-
gument over the best way to require
a roof on a dangemus dog’s pen.

“The Health Department will take
care of it,” Alderman Martie J.
Aboussie, D-9th Ward, and a sponsor
of the bill, said Friday.

The new ordinance will require
owners of “dangerous” or “potential-
ly dangerous” dogs to get special li-
censes, keep the dogs in secure pens
or muzzled and on leashes and carry
$50,000 in liability insurance.

It defines dangerous dogs as those
that have inﬂicted “severe injury” to
a human or another animal while off
their owners’ property. Potentially

dangerous dogs are those that show a

tendency for unprovoked attacks.

City animal-control officers will de-
termine whether dogs meet those
definitions. '

“Let me say right at the out-
set that I don’t think we have
been doing enough to protect
our. environment in recent
years. We need to do more."
Bush told a businessmen’s
luncheon. in an address that
praised the environmental rec-
ords of Republican presidents
Theodore Roosevelt and Nixon.
but not Reagan.

“With regard to acid rain.
we can't study the problem.”
Bush said. though the text pro-
vided to reporters said, “With
regard to acid rain, we can no
longer afford to simply study
the problem.” He went on. in
the address: “There must be a
national commitment to con—
tinue to reduce emissions of
sulfur and nitrogen dioxides.”

He also suggested that a
Bush administration would in-
clude a housecleaning in the
federal antipollution effort. say-
ing, “1 want to bring a lot of
new people to Washington who
don’t know what can’t be
done" about the environment.

And still others took the opportu—
nity to gloat over Toledo’s success in
nabbing a pair of pandas while ef-
forts by panda backer-sjn Michigan
have so far failed to prodirce animals
for an exhibit in Detroit. The Detroit
display, planned for the State Fair—
grounds, remains snarled in govem-
ment regulations.

“What are they going to do in
Detrdit?” asked Norm Fallenberg of
Toledo. “All they’re going to do is put
’em in a building at the fairgrounds.”

BUT DESPITE those feelings,
local ofﬁcials who arranged the visit
downplayed any competition.

“We never looked at it that way,”
claimed Edwin Bergsmark, the Tole-
do ﬁnancier and chairman of the
Toledo Zoo Society who master-
minded the operation. He said he

_would not mind seeing Detroit get
pandas as well, because the animals

are “loved by everyone in America,

especially the children.”

He called the legal attempts to
stop the exhibit “very foolish” and
charged that opponents appeared to
be motivated by “a high degree of

. jealousy more than anything.”

But Glenous Favata, curatOr of
mammals for the zoo. acknowledged
there were “mixed feelings” about the
exhibit among herself and otherzoo
staffers.

'will not even open to the public until
‘ the Chinese say so.
xCurrent plans call for the exhibit
. to open in a newly renovated $2
,, mil-lion display at the zoo on May 24.
, But ofﬁcials said it could open earlier
or later than that, depending on how
well the 8-year-old animals adjust to
their , new surroundings and a 12-

;. hour time difference between their

, , old homes—andtheir new quarters.

“They’re going to haVejet lag just

who along with about a dozen other

Pandas’ journey was obstacle
course for their travel agent '

By Dennis Ptaff
News Staff Writer

TOLEDO ~— Packaging a pair of
pandas for more than 19 hours of air
time and getting them delivered to
their temporary quarters at the Tole-
do Zoo comes close to being a travel
agent’s nightmare.

Ray Nies, one of scores of chore-
ographers fer the 200’s panda lift,
which culminated with the delivery
of Le Le and Nan Nan early Satur-
day morning, chose'to see it as a
challenge. ‘

Nies, a senior account executive
for Toledo’s Atlas Tours and Travel
Service Inc., spent last week arrang-
ing visas, monitoring last-minute
glitches and making and changing
plans for the animals.

“We had to have plans for this,”
said Nies. “But. if that didn’t work,
we better have Plan B ready; and if
that didn’t work, we better have
another plan. We have been to Plan
D already.”

 

THOSE PLANS nearly came
unraveled late in the week when
conservation groups —- alarmed by
shipments of the rare animals to zoos
and other exhibits -—— when to court
to block the Toledo exhibit.

While a U.S. District Court judge
in Washington temporarily rejected
the challenge by the World Wildlife

 

Fund and executives of the American
Association of Zoological Parks and

Aquariums, a hearing in the case this '

week could still send the pandas
packing.

Another last-minute hang-up in-
volved Chinese officials who ﬁlled
out the wrong forms for the animals.
But a ﬂurry of cables between the
U.S. government and Chinese ofﬁ-

Group wants action on Clayton pound

1CoUnty to respond to cruelty charges
after police report is released today

By John Brady '
Staﬂ Writer

About two dozen people con-
fronted Clayton County Commis-
sion Chairman Charley Griswell
Tuesday, charging that the coun-
ty’s pound is inhumane and de-
manding that three officials re-
sponsible for the facility’s
operation be fired. '

Griswell promised that the
group’s charges would be investi-
gated, and that he would release
the ﬁndings today. ‘

“I’m an animal lover myself,”
Griswell said, “If there’s any cru-
elty to animals going on up there,
it will be dealt with.”

He said he had ordered a po-
lice investigation of the pound af-
-_ ter hearing of the group’s charges

.. 9‘ 1.1... «.41. .

last week, and the report was due
today. .
Calling themselves the Citi-

zens for Effective Animal Control,

the group said the county’s pound
is overcrowded and dirty, and that
the method of euthanizing un—
wanted dogs and cats is cruel.

In a 13—point list of demands,
the group sought the firing of

county refuse control directorV
James Satterﬁeld, animal control a

supervisor Bill Whitlock, and
pound master Robert Folds; that
the pound be returned to the con-
trol of the county health depart-
ment; and staffed by trained ani-
mal control workers.

Conditions at the pound have
been a hot issue in the county
since the early 19803.

The group said Tuesday that

the gas chamber used to euthanize
dogs is inhumane because it is too
slow. The group would prefer that
unwanted animals be killed by le-
thal injection, said Beverly Cope-
land, a past president of the Clay-
ton County Humane Society.

Until 1985, dogs and cats were
euthanized by lethal injection, but
state officials ordered the practice
stopped after the Humane Society
pointed out pound personnel were
administering the drug without
the supervision of a veterinarian.

The pound uses a small gas
chamber to kill the animals, filling
it with the exhaust from a 12-
horsepower engine, said County

Administrator Joe Shelnutt. Last

year, Humane Society officials
said the engine used was worn out
and frequently broke down, keep-
ing animals trapped in the gas

chamber for hours until countyt‘

workers got the engine started.

A Humane Society attorney
said the engine was in such poor
condition it normally took an hour

and a half to produce enough car-
bon monoxide to kill the dogs.

Shelnutt acknowledged that
the county bought a new engine
because the old one often
wouldn’t start, but denied that
there had been any other prob-
lems with it.

He also said the pound was
put under the county refuse con;
trol department to bring it under
direct control of the county com-
mission. Before 1986, pound offi-
cials answered to the county
board of health.

On Tuesday, the group de-
manded the county plan to build a
new pound and have it operating
within one year. Griswell said the
county is already looking for a
new location. The pound is on Mt.
Zion Boulevard between Jones-
boro High School and an apart-
ment complex.

“It’s like a sanitation landﬁll
or a new jail,” Griswell said. “Ev-
erybody sees a need for it, but no-
body wants it next door.”

indian exhibit on trapping aims
to counter anti‘fur campaigns

, By Howard Witt
' , Chicago Tribune
LONDON -— It certainly seemed a
”sure-fire idea. Indian and Inuit fur
’“irappers from Canada’s far north,
‘hard hit by sophisticated British an-
imal rights campaigns against the
‘fur trade, decided to pitch a tepee
right in the enemy’s camp — liter-
ally. '
, They sponsored an exhibit at the
'British Museum’s venerable Mu-
seum of Mankind that depicts what
‘ life is like for Canada’s modern-day
native people, complete with a te-
pee, log cabin, igloo and all manner
of artifacts and pictures designed to
show the depth of their dependence
on hunting and trapping.

In an understated way, the ex-
hibit was designed to be as per-
suasive and compelling as the
graphic anti-fur campaigns waged
by British animal welfare groups,
the most dramatic of which se-
verely damaged the Canadian seal
fur industry several years ago when
the world was shown shocking film
footage of baby seals being clubbed
to death.

Europeans, the Canadians
hoped, might begin to understand
the consequences of their anti-fur
campaigns on the well-being of im-
poverished Indians.

But things have not gone accord-
ing to plan.

No sooner did the exhibit open
in December than the British gov-
ernment announced its intention to
enact a labeling law long. champi-
oned by the anti-fur movement. It
would require garments made from
animals caught in controversial
leg-hold traps to state that fact ex-
plicitly — something the animal
rights groups hope will be a turn-off
to prospective fur buyers.

The leg-hold trap, said by animal
welfare groups to cause extreme
suffering and death by starvation,
is widely used by Canadian natives.
But Canadian natives do not vote in
British elections.

“There is clearly in this country
' a lot of support for a label regula-
tion like this,” said Glenn Fisher, a
spokesman for Trade Minister Alan
Clark, who proposed the new law.
“It is not aimed at destroying . . .

 

“It’s really quite a
propaganda vehicle. It’s
an extremely smart
strategy to soften up the
public with a fairly
romantic view of fur
trapping and then make
it look like the animal
rights groups are
threatening them. But I
suspect the British public
is not as gullible as the
fur industry takes them
to be.”

- Mark Glover,

director of Lynx,

anti‘fur group

 

(the‘Indians’) livelihood. It’s aimed
at prOviding consumers with neces-
sary information.”

As if the labeling law weren’t
trouble enough, it seems that many
of 100,000-p1us visitors who have
viewed the “Living Arctic” exhibit
may be missing its subtlelpro-fur
point. ' - '

“People don’t seem to be making
the connection between the exhibi-
tion and the animal rights issue,”
said Jonathan King, curator of the
exhibit. “If that is what (the
Canadians) hoped for, it’s not hap-
pening.”

In addition, the exhibit has
stirred the predictable scorn of ani-
mal welfare groups. .

“It’s really quite a propaganda
vehicle,” said Mark Glover, director
of a British anti-fur group called
Lynx that has led the fight for the

"labeling law. “It’s an extremely

smart strategy to soften up the pub—
lic with a fairly romantic view of
fur trapping and then make it look
like the animal rights groups are
threatening them. But I suspect the
British public is not as gullible as
the fur industry takes them to be.”
The Canadian natives are taking
all this philosophically, preferring

to stress the long-term public sen-
sitization they hope will result from
the exhibit, which has attracted
record crowds to the museum and
will run for another year.

But they are clearly disap-
pointed.

“They are targeting the most vul-
nerable people first with this label-
ing law, but we are optimistic that
this thing is not going to beat us
down,” said Cindy Gilday, a Dene
Indian and spokeswoman for Indi-
genous Survival International, the
Canadian native group that orga-
nized the exhibit and raised
$400,000 toward its cost. Most of the
money came from the Canadian
government.

“Before, most Europeans didn’t
know a thing about how’we lived,”
she said. “Now they know that there
is a living, breathing, thriving In-
dian culture in North America with
people who hunt and fish and trap
to make their living.”

“Living Arctic” is an attention-
grabbing show, especially for Euro—
peans who have long idealized
North America’s Indians.

Divided into sections devoted to
the lives of Canada’s distinct Arctic
and sub-Arctic peoples, the exhibit
features a Cree tepee, a full-size
Dene log cabin, a cutaway life-size
model of an Inuit hunting igloo and
a re-created living room from a con-
temporary Arctic pre-fabricated
home.

The displays are startlingly au-
thentic, down to the smoke-black-
ened cabin lined with dirty strips of
cardboard boxes — often the only
insulation available to remote and
poverty-stricken Dene families in
the Northwest Territories.

A television broadcasting a satel-
lite hockey game and a computer
programmed in Inuktitut figure
prominently in the Inuit living
room, where a female mannequin
sits on the floor cleaning an animal
skin with an ulu knife.

Elsewhere, films and photo-
graphs portray the minutiae of
daily life, from fishing and hunting
to religious ceremonies and an af-
ternoon Inuit snack of raw seal
meat.

:National Parks Urged to Ban All Concessions

 

WASHINGTON, May 25 (AP) — The
. Federal Government should move all
hotels and other concessions out of the
national parks, an environmental
' group said Tuesday in issuing a report
on what it considers the 10 most threat-
: ened parks. .
GeorgeuFrampton, president of the
, group, the Wilderness Society, also
urged the Government to end subsidies
for activities of other Federal agencies
that could hurt the parks.

“Motels and hotels and that kind of
thing should go outside the national
parks,” Mr. F rampton said at a news
conference. “Jails and concession

In its section on Yosemite National
Park in California, the report noted
that plans called for a beauty parlor

An Ongoing Controversy

~Mr. Frampton’s remarks were the
latest in a long controversy over what
should be allowed in national parks.

There have been hotels in the parks

since the earliest days of the National
Park Service, which was founded in
1916, and calls for their removal go
back almost as long. '
Denis Galvin, deputy director of the
service, said the agency did not want to

 

add any hotels in parks. But he also
said the service believed that “the
level of development in the traditional 1
parks is appropriate and provides an
opportunity for a park experience
that’s rapidly becoming unique, and
just as valid as the backpacking ex-
perience.”

“We aim to provide both,” he added.

The society’s report was timed to
coincide with the beginning of the sum-
mer vacation season, which could
bring a record number of visitors to
many parks. The report was also timed
to precede the first meeting in 12 years
of all park superintendents, scheduled
for next month at a lodge near Yellow-

Dear Constance:

Thank you for contacting me regarding the National
Chimpanzee Management Plan. I appreciate your concern in this
matter. :

The National Chimpanzee Management Plan was established
under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health to help
increase the number of chimpanzees available for biomedical
research. There are 350 chimps in the program located at five
centers in the United States. Scientists hope that 60 offspring
will be produced each year. Half of those will be incorporated
into the breeding program and the other half will be used for
research purposes.

The intentional mistreatment of animals is an issue of great
concern to me. I recognize, however, that certain forms of
medical research -- the results of which could aid millions of
human lives -- can only be conducted through the use of animals.
For instance, the chimpanzee, according to the Congressional
Research Service, is the only sub- human primate that can develop
antibodies to the AIDS virus. It is my expectation that all
federally funded medical research projects involving animals are
conducted humanely.

Your views are very important to me, and I hope you will
continue to contact me on matters of interest and concern to you.

Sincerely,

Sam Nunn

Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 2089, the Oil Shale
Mining Claims Conversion Act and the recent issuance of swan
hunting permits by the State of North Carolina. I appreciate
your sharing your views with me on these issues.

S. 2089 has been referred to the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee for review. I will follow the Committee's
actions on this measure with your strong interest in mind. As
the full Senate reviews this bill or similar legislation, your

comments will be very helpful to me.

As you may know, North Carolina maintains two different swan
populations —- the tundra and the trumpeter —- neither of which
is endangered. Swan hunting permits can be issued by states
under the Migratory Bird Act, which establishes population
maintenance and hunting guidelines for the United States. Within
this federal framework, each state can establish controls to fit
its own unique situation. As long as the state adheres to the
federal regulations, the matter is out of my jurisdiction.

Please be assured that I will continue to monitor this
situation with your concerns in mind.

It was good to hear from you.

Sincerely,

DR JANE GOODALL, the
world’s leading chimpanzee
expert, said yesterday that
demands by American Aids
~researchers for thousands of
wild chimpanzees for medi-
cal experiments could lead to
the animal’s extinction.

Dr Goodall, 54, who has spent
most of the past 28 years in the
Tanzanian bush studying chim-
panzees, was launching a British
branch of the Jane Goodall Insti-
tute at the Royal Overseas Club
inLondon.

Among the trustees of the
foundation, which is dedicated to
wildlife research and conserva-
tion, are Sir Laurens van der
Post, Sir Peter Scott, Prof
Robert Hinde and Dr John
Tandy, head of the British Veter-
inary Association.

Dr Goodall said that, according
to the United States National
Institutes for Health, whose
chief scientist is leading Aids
researcher Dr
Robert Gallo, thousands of wild
chimps would be needed at an
increasing rate.

Aids research threatens
chimpanzee extinction

By Charles Clover, Environment Correspondent

Chimpanzees, which now num-
ber 175,000 or less, are found in a
band across Africa from the
Ivory Coast to Tanzania and
Uganda. Their last strongholds
are Gabon, Cameroon and the
Central African Republic.

In the West Africa countries of
Liberia, Sierre Leone and the
Ivory Coast, the chimps are rec-
ognised internationally as being
“endangered,” Dr Goodall said.

She viewed with alarm plans to
set up laboratories in Africa to
get round the international con-
vention on the import of endan-
gered species.

She and seven eminent medical
scientists, led by Dr Jan Moor-
Jankowski of New York Univer-
sity, have written a report, to be
published in a forthcoming issue

of the magazine Nature, saying

there are adequate supplies of
chimps in captivity for research
into hepatitis and Aids.

What makes chimps valuable
to researchers is their similarity
to human beings. They are the
only other species to develop
type B hepatitis and are the only
animals scientists have been able
to inject with the Aids virus with
any degree of reliability.

OCon Coughlin in New York
writes: American scientists
working to combat Aids in young
children have received promis-
ing results from initial tests
which indicate their lives can be
prolonged and improved.

According to ofﬁcial figures
compiled by the US Centre for
Disease Control, 981 American
children have developed Aids

neither she nor her master fell under
the train today, an experience knovm to
both of them. Then she curls up and
proceeds to explore the real meaning
of life \ia her beloved 40 winks.

Meanwhile, in the north London
borough of Brent, Headley, who enjoys
a slower start to the day, is popping
down to the comer shop. But by mid-
moming he’s making his way to Brent
Town Hall for the start of a hectic
agenda of committee meetings and civic
duties.

He leads Councillor Len Williams,
Mayor of Brent, on to the tube at
Kilbum and then off it at Wembley
Park. Here there are six lanes of trafﬁc
to negotiate. No dog can cope with that.
So they both wait patiently until
someone offers help.

Once across, it’s a comfortable stroll
all the way to the Town Hall. Headley
trots up the steps, into the lift and out at
the ﬁrst ﬂoor, then along the corridor
and through the ﬁfth door along.

Mr Williams picks up his agenda.
Possibly it’s straight into committee
where Headley is known for his intense
concentration, resting his head on his
paws and keeping his eyes clamped
shut. Headley is also appreciated for his
stylish put-downs; he rises to his feet
and yawns in the face of long-winded
bores, before sighing and pretending to
die with a dramatic flop worthy of a ham
actor.

Julia Schoﬁeld, 36, has a PhD in
man—computing interaction from the
National Physical Laboratory where her
husband is the deputy head of
computing. Blind since birth, she
employs ﬁve staff in Richmond, Surrey,
developing digitised pictures for
marketing. Yates, a three-year-old cross
between a Labrador and a retriever, is
her third guide dog.

‘I need a dog which is highly
adaptable,’ she says. ‘I travel all over the
country and there’s no regular route for
him to learn. He also has to be sociable
because I attend a lot of dinners.’

Yates was selected for special training
by Richard F itzjohn, an instructor with
the Guide Dogs for the Blind
Association at their regional centre in
Wokingham, Berkshire. He received the
help of British Airways in familiarising
the dog with ﬂying. He also trained
Yates to resist the vol-au-vents he might
feel tempted to try when dining out.

Yates displayed these perfect
manners when Dr Schoﬁeld received
her ‘Woman of the Year’ award at the
Savoy last year. ‘I’d not have been
popular if he’d started scofﬁng
everything within reach,’ she says. ‘He’s
a very bright dog with good

concentration who can take the stress. 1
He’s extremely handsome and loves
posing. You grow very attached. Bin 1
can’t afford to spoil him — to me he’s a
working dog. It’s other people who do
the spoiling.’

Mike Bannister, 47, used to be a
foreign exchange dealer before diabetes I
stole his sight in 1978. He now deyises
training courses used around the world.

‘Rissy and I have a bond which will l
last for ever,’ he says. ‘She’s so laid back,
it’s not true. She’s completely relaxed
and placid and can sleep at the drop of a
hat.’

That bond has been sealed by shared
danger, mainly caused by British Rail
changing carriage design. Once, Mr
Bannister slipped between carriage and
platform. Another time Rissy, a yellow
Labrador, fell right under the carriage.
The brave dog still kept her cool.

‘She’s nine now and it’s that
temperament which has enabled her to
keep working for so long,’ he says. ‘I’m
due a replacement soon and then she’ll
retire and live with me and my wife until
she dies.’

Len Williams, 62, went blind three
decades ago. For years he used a white
cane. He fell dovm manholes, stumbled
into roadworks and was frequently
injured in collisions. He once walked
right off the station platform at Harrow
on the Hill.

Then he got his ﬁrst dog, Pedlar, and
now Headley, three—quarters retriever
and the colour of champagne. ‘Headley
is my life,’ he says. ‘I put my life in his
care every day. He never betrays that
trust. He’s perfect, absolutely perfect.
He’s like a limb of my body.’

Headley is 21 Brent celebrity, as well
as the Mayor himself. On his birthday,
the local cinema presented them both
with a huge cake. He recently led his
master on a ﬁve—mile sponsored walk.
‘He worked to perfection,’ says Mr
Williams. ‘I felt so very proud.’

Guide dogs were ﬁrst trained in
Germany in the 19205 to help men
blinded in the First World War. But
nowadays Britain leads the world in
their development. In the past, 80 per
cent of dogs failed in training. Now that
ﬁgure is 20 per cent, mainly because of
selective breeding. It costs J€1,000 to
prepare and place a dog.

‘A dog is unique,’ says Alan Brooks,
training manager at Wokingham. ‘lt
looks upon a human as the leader of the
pack. That’s why we can create this
bond between blind person and guide
dog. It’s really, really wonderful.’ I

Hairy encounters

 

Zoo Atlanta’s Willie B. appears to unnerve

a fellow gorilla, but not the three ladies%

By Jack Warner
Staﬂr Writer

He sits motionless under the
water oak, nearly invisible
against the tree and the man-
made rocks, looking intently
across the moat at a hairy face
peering around the corner.

A soft snort escapes his lips.
he begins to rise and 20 yards
away the massive head disap-
pears swiftly behind the rocks.

There are few sights in all of
nature more fearsome than a
bull gorilla —— especially to an-
other bull gorilla.

And Willie B., the pride of
Zoo Atlanta, is getting his ﬁrst
good look

The huge lowland gorilla
spent the last 27 of his 30 years
indoors in the company of noth—

ing but humans. Two weeks ago, "

he ventured outdoors for the

first time since infancy, testing
the pleasures of the 200’s new
.Ford African Rain Forest. Last
week, the neighborhood started
filling up.

Rann and his three female

consorts, the ﬁrst of three fam-
ilies of gorillas donated to Zoo

Atlanta by the Yerkes Primate

Research Center at Emory Uni-
versity, arrived last week. Fri-
day, Rann and his family and
Willie B. were allowed outside at
the same time.

A moat separated them, but
it may as well have been the

Grand Canyon. For two hours.

they engaged in a ponderous, al-
most ritualized kind of hide-and-
seek, with the animals on both
sides fearful yet curious.

oth-

er gorillas. Last week, Willie and
lthe Rann family were placed in
fcages within 10 feet of each other.
Willie is nothing if not cool,
according to Zoo Atlanta Director
‘Terry Maples. He handled the ini-
‘Ltial encounter with aplomb, al-
most indifference. Rann was not

, ;so comfortable, Maples said.

“Rann has three girls to pro-
ﬁftect,” Maples pointed out. “Willie
has nothing to lose.”

The inevitable fireworks be—

;gan later in the first day, he said.
~~_;The two bulls ran through the en-
tire repertoire of their threat dis-
plays. Ear-shattering bellows ech-
}_oed through the steel and
concrete holding building; they
pounded their chests like kettle
drums; and charged to the limit of
Ztheir cages.
. But things had settled down
"by Friday’s outdoor encounter,
”observed by the usual throng of
reporters and photographers

Willie emerged first, majestic,
his silvery back glistening in the
:low morning light. Rann and his

family, in the habitat next door, '

:were much more cautious Thurs-
«day was their ﬁrst venture into
Ethe habitat.

“Willie seems to have intimi-
dated Rann a little,” Maples said.
He appears considerably larger
than the Yerkes gorilla.

When Rann first came into
sight, Willie ambled down the,
slope toward the edge of the moat
and Rann scurried back indoors.

AWillie was content to remain
outdoors, sitting much of the time
in the little bamboo grove planted
for him, idly bending the shoots
over, snapping one occasionally
with a report like a cap pistol.

Rann wanted to keep his
women out of sight. When one
started to follow him out, he
quickly shooed her back inside.
Occasionally one of the females
ventured out alone, but only
briefly.

Rann heaved around the cor—
ner again, sidled up to a fallen
tree by the moat and sat down,
one elbow on the tree like a
lounge lizard in a singles bar. Wil-
lie watched this insolent display
for a few seconds, then arose and
strode out of the grove, thrashing
the bamboo as he left. Rann held
his ground a few seconds, then
got up slowly and disappeared
around the corner.

The 200’s rain forest habitat is
intended to encourage this sort of
behavior, Maples said.

“There is no other place in
America like this,” he said, where

see each other.

“The exhibit is intended t(
keep the gorillas vigilant,” he
said. “The fact that they are inter
acting this way shows the exhibi
works.”

Maples said no one though
that Willie would ever be more
than a solitary male; there are
solitary male gorillas in the Afri
can forest. But he has become ac
climated to his changing sur
roundings so swiftly, Maples said
that they now hope to ﬁnd a mate
for him among the gorillas fron
Yerkes. .

Rann’s fears are unfounded
however; he won’t lose one of hi:
harem to Willie unless the femali
rejects him for some reason.

In the early afternoon, the go
rillas were brought back inside -
Willie responding to the call 0

Horton They returned to theii

Grillas go ape over
3 winning nut puzzle

Here’s a philosophical ques-
tion for aspiring architects:
Which is the more diﬂicult cli—
ent, the many potential users of
a new downtown library or a
group of lowland gorillas at the
Lincoln Park Zoo?

On the one hand, gorillas are
less likely to complain about de-
sign inadequacies. On the other
hand, Otto weighs 400 pounds.
If he chooses to express ar-
chitectural criticism, one might
want to stay out of the way.

As the architectural competi-
tion to build the new library be-
gins, another competition has
ended. Already the gorillas in
the Great Ape House are play-
ing with the “nut puzzle” de-
signed by Bobby Chan while he
was in an architectural design
class at the University of Illi-_
noiseChicago.

Chan, 25, was the winner of a
competition to build an activity
module for the primates. The
idea for the competition was
born when zoo director Dr.
Lester Fisher approached Stan-
ley Tigerman, director of the
universrty’s School of Architec-
ture, for student help in design—
ing a device that would spark
the interest of the intelligent
animals and keep them busy.
“‘The activity module is part
of a continuing attempt to make
life more interesting for our
animals,” Fisher said.

Tigerman turned to Roberta
Feldman, assistant professor of
architecture and holder of a de—
gree in environmental psycholo—

y.

“I said, ‘Stanlcy, I know about
human behavior, but I’m not
sure 1 know much about gorilla

behavior,’ ” Feldman recalled.

But she thought the project
would be a challenge for her
ﬁrst—year undergraduate design
students. “They would get to
meet not just the eventual
clients,- which are gorillas, but
with clients at the zoo, [curator
of mammals] Mark Rosenthal
and the keepers,” she said.

And so she and her students

set out to learn about gorillas.
They visited the zoo and spoke
to keepers. They watched the
orillas. They read about goril-
as. Rosenthal went to their
school and showed a movie and
lectured on gorillas. Rosenthal
and zookeepers visited the class
several times to offer suggestions
about student designs. .

At the ﬁnal judging in March,
1987, Rosenthal chose 10 prom-
ising designs. He and other ofﬁ-
cials then selected Chan’s as the
best.

Chan designed a plexiglass cyl—
inder enclosing four stainless
steel discs, each with a small
hole. It is ﬁlled with peanuts at
the top. When the gorilla twists
the cylinder, nuts fall through
the holes and, eventually, out
the bottom.

Chan returned to his native
Hong Kong to work as a con—
struction site engineer before
Feldman could tell him he had
won. He did not ﬁnd out until a
year later, when he retumed to
Chicago last month.

He went right to the Great

ciety.

It was not an easy task. The stu-
dents were accustomed to designing
projects aimed at clients a little fur-
ther up the evolutionary ladder.

“These clients are different,” Chan
said. “They’re monkeys.”

“It was very difficult for the stu-
dents at ﬁrst,” Feldman said. “They
could not use any of their precon-
ceptions in the design work. They
had absolutely no familiarity with
zoo design, let alone the behavior of
gorillas.”

But Chan said the architectural
problems would be the same if he
were designing for humans.

.“It’s very rational,” he said. “You

'think of how to attract them to your

design, like you think of how to at-
tract people to your building.”

The zoo rejected some students’
designs because they would have
been too expensive. Others seemed
too ﬂimsy to stand up to the goril- ‘
as.

Chan initially designed a kind of
box with holes into which gorillas
could insert sticks and knock out

 

l

 

 

 

‘

fruit. On one of their visits, the

keepers told him the gorillas could

probably empty the box in half an
hour.

With only three days to go before
the final judging, Chan thought of
the cylinder, and decided to change
his entire entry.

“He had only two days to draw it
up,” Feldman said. “He stayed up.
He got no sleep. All the other stu-
dents were talking about it like he
was crazy.”

Crazy like a fox. The zoo had
three of Chan’s nut puzzles made,
paying a manufacturer $1,000 each,
and installed them in March. .

The gorillas like them so much
that they empty the puzzles of 3
pounds of peanuts in two hours.
Lenore, whose left hand was ampu—
tated after she developed arthritis,
has learned to operate it one-hand-
ed, twisting the cylinder and then
quickly thrusting her hand below to
catch the nuts.

Rosenthal praises the puzzle for
taking advantage of gorilla foraging
instincts. .

Chan has decided to pursue a
master’s degree in architecture. He
can look forward to someday serving
clients who do not walk on their
knuckles.

May Hal/e Died Seeking Food

Rare Sea Turtle Found
on Santa Rosa Island

By CHARLES HILLINGER, Time Staff Writer

SANTA ROSA ISLAND,
Calif—A rare 700-pound leather-
back sea turtle has been found on
this island 30 miles off Santa Bar—
bara, where it died apparently after
coming ashore to feed.

The creature, which measured
more than 6 feet in length, is only
the third leatherback that has been
found on Southern California
beaches in the last 15 years. All
three were dead.

The discovery, made Monday by
Bill Ehorn, superintendent of
Channel Islands National Park, has
marine biologists abuzz. Leathers
backs are an endangered species
and are rarely seen by humans.

Gary Davis, 43, marine biologist
for the park, removed the skull and
bones Thursday and transported
them to the Santa Barbara Museum
of Natural History, where they will
be held for scientists to study.

Barely Seen Anywhere

Leatherbacks spend their entire
lives—believed to be as long as 100
years—swimming in the ocean,
roaming as far as hundreds of miles
offshore. They can weigh as much
as a ton and are rarely seen by
humans, said Karen Bjorndal, di—
rector of the Sea Turtle Research
Center at the University of Florida.
Gainesville.

“Prints in the sand indicate this
female leatherback turtle crawled
ashore and died not too long before
being discovered,” Davis said. Da-
vis conducted an autopsy and could
find no eggs or indication of any
injury. He was unable to determine
the cause of death.

Davis believes the turtle may
. have gone ashore to feed on jelly-

fish, its primary food. For the past

week beaches in Ventura and Santa
Barbara counties have been cov—
ered with millions of velella, a
small species of jellyfish also
known as sailor by the wind.

Ehorn discovered the turtle
while riding horseback along a
beach on this virtually uninhabited
" island, which is part of the Channel

Islands National Park.
“I had two phone calls from two

‘ different recreation divers this
week who had been diving off
Anacapa Island,” Davis said. “They

Pacific, feeding mostly on jellyfish,
Bjorndal said.

Bjorndal noted that although all
sea turtles are endangered species,
in Indonesia and elsewhere leath-
erbacks are taken at sea by fisher-
men. The extremely oily meat is
relished as a delicacy.

GAINESVILLE - This is the
season when bull alligators wander
from pond to pond in search of love,
but instead of finding a mate they
may encounter frightened home-
owners whose complaints will
doom the gator, a University of
Florida zoologist said.

“One of the biggest problems is
that many people who move into
the state are obviously Northerners
who’ve had no experience with alli-
gators except what they’ve seen on
TV or read about in novels,” said
Kent Vliet, a postdoctorate asso-
ciate and an authority on alliga-
tors.

“They have very little tolerance

for living around alligators or hav-.

ing alligators near them.”
Vliet did research by swimming

haunts.

Alligators are no more danger;-

the past, gators that were hailed

Vliet said he doubts that the
state’s alligator papulation wit? de-'
cline much from the complants,
because female alligators are pro-
lific reproducers.

' The nuisance-complaint llills,

CREATIVE LOAF ING

 

 

 

by Katey Breen

Director of Education for Atlanta
Humane Society ‘

The concept of Pet Therapy has been
used in a limited capacity by some
psychologists since the 19505. Until
recently, however, very little information
existed on the effects of animals with the
institutionalized elderly or hospitalized
people.

Just in the past 10 years, research has
been conducted that shows the dramatic
effects that can result from the human/
animal bond, including: improved physical
health and longevity of life; reduced stress
and blood pressure; improved mental
well-being and increased self-esteem.

Pet Therapy has now become a viable
means of reaching the elderly in nursing
homes whose lives have become dull and
devoid of caring. touching and interacting.
Results not only include the above
mentioned physical improvements, but
also have resulted in other benefits such as
improved socialization, increased
verbalization and improved reality
orientation. 4

The Atlanta Humane Society’s Pet
Facilitated Therapy program began in
June 1982 after volunteer Marti Wilson
attended a Delta Society Conference. This
organization, comprised of veterinarians,
physicians, psychologists and humane
society workers, was formed to promote
the human/ animal bond through seminars
and research.

 

The reason for Pet Therapy’s success is
because animals are non-judgemental.
They do not care about one’s social status,
race, age, sex or physical state.

Another importantaspect of this
program which cannot be discounted is
the volunteers. The program is called Pet
Facilitated Therapy for a good reason.
The animals help create a less threatening
environment for the patients; volunteers
are thus provided with the opportunity to
talk with the residents in a positive
atmosphere. Together, a volunteer and a
patient may laugh over a puppy’s antics,
reminisce or even share a tear over a
patient’s animal that has had to be given
up. Pets help facilitate these very
important interactions.

Since the program has been so
successful in nursing homes, we wondered
if the effects would be the same in other
facilities. While the benefits may vary a
little, our visits to facilities such as
Shepherd Spinal Center, Georgia
Retardation Center, Cerebral Palsy
Center, Scottish Rite Hospital for Children
and Egelston Children’s Hospital have
been well received.

The visits in the hospitals or
rehabilitaition settings help to reduce the
stress felt by patients and sometimes
family members. The Society received a
phone call recently about our Pet Therapy
program at Scottish Rite Hospital. The
woman, obviously near tears, just wanted
to tell us how much our visit had meant to

Although there are over 40 volunteers

enough volunteers are available to

 

accommodate them. Call Tina Edwards at

Last post for dog and master ,

A YELLOW Labrador called

master, Cpl Derek Hayes,
with full military honours
yesterday.

The dog’s ashes, placed in a
tiny pine hex, were put on top of
‘ his master’s ﬁiﬂn and lowered
into the grave at Newport Ceme-
tery, Lincbln.

They were killed by an IRA

tary extension of his tour of duty.
He had wanted to remain with
his dog.

Cpl Hayes’ widow, Susan, of
Shannon Avenue, Boultham
Moor, Lincoln, threw a single red
rose into the grave as the last
post was sounded.

It is believed to be the ﬁrst
time that the Army has allowed
one of its guard dogs to share in
the honour of a full military
funeral.

The service was attended by
members of the Royal Pioneer

Corps and oﬂicers from North.

Ben’s ashes were brought into
the church and placed on a pur-
ple cushion to symbolise the

'close relationship of trust with

Cpl Hayes.

The Rev Derek Brown, Rector
of Holy Cross Church, Boultham

were inseparable. They lived
together, worked together and
died together. It is only right '
they should be buried together.
Their relationship was very ,
special.” 7 y

Officer’s

German shepherd
helps master take

a bite out of crime

By John Rice

When Plano police officer Rick
McDonald sees something out of the ordi-
nary on patrol, he lets his partner know.
When his partner observes something
fishy, he barks.

Though his partner has four paws,
McDonald entrusts his life to the 2-year-
old German shepherd named Blitz just as
he would a colleague with hands and feet.
McDonald, who has eight years with the
force, has been in charge of the canine
unit: since 1982, and he and Blitz have
been a team for six months.

In early November, Blitz replaced Hero,
a German shepherd that spent five years
on the force. Blitz and McDonald have
come a long way from their training to-
gether in Newton, Kan, where it took
more than a day before Blitz would allow
McDonald to pet him.

The two now have a relationship that
walks a fine line. One moment, it seems as
though Blitz is a robot and McDonald is
working the controls. The next moment,
the pair can be playing ball during a short
break or carrying on a Casual “conversa-
tion.” 1 '

“I talk to him all 'he time,” McDonald
says. “I really think understands. We’ll
be going by somethi g, and I’ll say, ‘Blitz,
did you see that?‘ a d he’ll be looking
right at whatever I w. We’ll be going
through a parking 10 , and he’ll see some-
thing you don't see and bark. That's his
way of saying, ‘Hey, d (1 you see that?’

“His vision is so good, though, that
when he barks at s mething, I don’t al-
ways catch it, and then I wonder like
crazy what it was ——,'because he’s always
right, and it’s always something.”

Recently, two officers chased a robbery
suspect into an apartment complex. The
officers told McDonald they had checked
a bush-lined fence and were convinced

that the suspect had scaled it and ﬂed. But
after following the man’s scent, Blitz
knew the man had not jumped the fence.

Within minutes, Blitz found the man
hiding with his back 'against the bushes
and his body curled around the bumper of
a car. Blitz had found the suspect, but the
police still couldn’t see him.

“What’s really weird is that the dog
sees him and bites him and is going crazy,
and you still can’t see him," McDonald
says. “This guy was bid really good.”

Blitz has a wide range of other abilities
that come in handy during McDonald’s
late-night patrol. Blitz, who was initially
trained in East Germany and responds
only to commands Spoken in German, is
trained to sniff out narcotics, search
buildings and find intruders, track sus-
pects for at least a mile and, most import.
antly, protect McDonald.

Each night, McDonald drives the alleys

behind strip shopping centers several
times and tugs on doors to make sure
they’re locked. Blitz’s specialties are
searching unlocked buildings and finding
burglars, and that’s what he does most of-
ten during a normal shift.

When it comes to looking out for
McDonald, Blitz knows only what he has

been taught to know. While
McDonald stops a woman for ex-
pired license plates, the dog’s eyes
are glued to his partner. His ears
stand at attention, and he exhibits
nervous energy with a high-pitched
whine. If a suspect were to push or
hit McDonald, Blitz would leap
from the car and attack the assail-
ant. But even after the officer
makes it back to the patrol car safe
and sound, Blitz sometimes isn’t sat-
isfied and barks uncontrollably.

“It’s pretty funny,” McDonald
says. “When somebody drives off af-
ter a stop, he thinks the bad guys
are getting away.”

While Blitz worries about
, McDonald, McDonald doesn’t worry
much about Blitz. Besides being
physically imposing with his mas-
sive head, intimidating teeth and
fierce growl, the dog has a couple of
built-in safety features.

Blitz will bite anyone other than
McDonald who tries to feed him, no
matter how tempting the treat. This
means that the dog can’t be poi-
soned. And since Blitz is all busi-
ness until McDonald orders other-
wise, the dog will also bite anyone
attempting to pet him while he’s
carrying out his duties.

Just as Blitz depends on his part-
ner’s commands for his every move,
McDonald’s life revolves around
and is entwined with his dog’s.
McDonald must maintain the dog’s

work ethic.

“We work from 9 pm. until 6
am,” McDonald says. “He eats
when we get home, and then we
sleep. That schedule must be main-

tained for the type of work he does.
Vacations, for example, are tough.
The only place he can be put is at
the vet’s. Since he’s poisoned-
trained, he self-imposes a fast for
two or three days -— then he eats.”

McDonald is on call 24 hours a .
day, seven days a week, so he must
have a list of dependable baby-
sitters by the phone in case his wife
is gone and he has to leave his two
children. To keep Blitz’s routine
from getting out of kilter, he takes
Hero on daytime calls. McDonald
says he doesn’t have a normal social
life, admitting that he’s had to cur-

The McDonalds may not get to do

members can’t help but get in-

cially McDonald’s 2-year-old son.

“He can say ‘Mommy,’ ‘Daddy,’
‘wawa’ and stuff like that,”
McDonald says of his son, “but he
probably knows more German than
he does English. He hears me all the
time commanding the dogs in Ger-

dogs will be barking, and he’ll go to
the door and yell at the dogs in Ger-

As time goes on and his children

The Associated Press

ATLANTA —— Willie 3., Zoo
Atlanta’s famous lowland goril-
la, showed his way with the la-
dies on Friday. And their live-in
lover went ape.

Willie B., who ended 27 years
of life in a cage two weeks ago
with tentative steps into a new
outdoor home, was allowed out-
doors with other apes for the
first time on Friday. But Rann,
the 25-year-old silverback who
lives with the females and fa-
thered five of their six offspring,
was not about to let the naive go-
rilla near his harem.

Rann spent most of the day
swaggering around, but in one
jealous fit he smacked one of the
female gorillas and shoved her
back inside.

“He just knows there is anoth-
er male . . . on the scene and he’s
trying to protect his females,”
said Frederick King, director of
Emory University’s Yerkes Pri-
mate Research Center, which
lent Rann and his family to the
zoo.

But a moat separated Willie

 

B. from the other gorillas.

When Willie B. drifted into
Rann’s line of vision and

erched under a magnolia tree,

ann hopped up and chased the
ladies inside.

The ritual got violent when
Shamba, the dominant female in
Rann’s harem, trotted out to get
a look at Willie B. Her advances
prompted Rann to shove her
back inside and, later, to hit her
on the head.

King said Ra‘nn’s jealousy
may keep him from becoming
friends with Willie B.

He said Willie B.’s shift to out-
door life after more than two de-
cades as a loner would have
been facilitated by placing him
with a female who could have
“shown him the things he would
need to know” about socializing.

The outdoor habitat is a major
step forward for the zoo, which
the U.S. Humane Society de-
clared as one of the nation’s
worst four years ago. Zoo Atlan-
ta officials say the new exhibit,
built with a $1 million grant
from Ford Motor Co., is the most
advanced gorilla habitat at any
zoo.

Animal programs

breeding success '

Rare species give birth in captivity

By James Coates
Chicago Tribune

SAN DIEGO — Those on the front
lines of the war against wildlife ex-
tinction were basking in some rare
glory recently.

“It’s been a great couple of weeks
for the captive breeders,” said
Larry Killmar, curator of mammals
at the San Diego Wild Animal Park.

Molloko, the first California con-
dor conceived in captivity, was
hatched at the park, creating a
global media sensation. A number
of other rare successes, however,
received much less attention be-
cause they occurred about the same
time, Killmar said.

On April 3, for example, Becky, a
black-footed ferret and one of only
26 members of that fierce species
still alive, gave birth to two tiny
pups in a captive breeding center in
Sybille, Wyo.

“We have strong indications that
another 15 female ferrets are im-
pregnated,” said Sharon Rose, a
spokeswoman for the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service in Denver, which
oversees the ferret project. “We’re
expecting a baby boom any day
now.”

Four years ago, only six black-
footed ferrets were in existence. All
were captured by Wyoming game
officials for captive breeding in an
effort to stave off extinction.

Another victory came two weeks
ago, when Dr. Thomas Cade’s team
at the Peregrine Fund in Boise,
Idaho, helped hatch two rare Mauri-
tius kestrels from captive parents. It
was the first time these African
birds of prey have been mated in
the Americas.

Bill Heinrich, Cade’s associate,
said in a telephone interview that
the group’s other project, raising
and releasing threatened peregrine
falcons, will result in the breeding
of almost 300 birds in captivity be-
fore they are set free in 18 states
this year.

To their delight, scientists at the
privately operated Peregrine Fund
project discovered that the falcons

 

“It’s been a great couple
of Weeks for the captive
breeders.”

Animal Park

can be introduced into big cities,
where they feed on pigeons and
other urban game and use tall
buildings the way their ancestors
used cliffs.

Wild breeding pairs of pereg-
rines now live in Salt Lake City,
Denver, Milwaukee and Chicago.
On May 2, ornithologists discovered
two chicks, the first to be hatched
in Illinois since 1951, on a 34th-ﬂoor
ledge of a downtown Chicago office

_ building.

California condors may have
been making the headlines lately,
but they have a long way to go be-
fore they catch up with the pereg-
rines. Even black-footed ferrets will
outnumber condors if the predicted
Wyoming baby boom really hap
pens.

Molloko’s birth raises the condOr
roll call to a precarious 28. All the
nation’s condors are in captivity af-
ter breeders defeated environmen-
talists in federal courts in Califor-
nia and won permission to trap the
last birds in the wild in 1986 and
1987.

Critics of captive breeding, such
as David Phillips of the Earth Island
Institute in San Francisco, warn
that once animals are removed
from a habitat, there are enormous

 

pressures to alter that habitat. ’

Therefore, he said, reintroducing
the birds into nature is unlikely,

even if scientists can getﬂthe wild "

creatures to mate in cages —- a diffi-
cult feat in itself.

It took bird experts at the San Di-
ego park six years to get captive
condors to breed. And though con-
dors may be the best known, they
are only one species among more

 

l
1

than 47 in the captive breeding pro-
gram.

The wild animal park, which oc-
‘cupies almost 2,000 acres, is a mod-
;ern day Noah’s Ark for endangered
species, at the forefront of this

country’s breeding effort. Other
creatures in its breeding program
include the Arabian oryx, Przewal-
Ski’s wild horse, Sumatran tiger,
South African cheetah, maned wolf,
Persian onager, Transcaspian ku-
lan, Somali wild ass, lowland tapir
' and three species of rhinoceroses —-
the East African black, the great In-
dian and the northern white.
_ The northern white rhino is a
. male, Killmar said, and negotia-
tions are under way to bring the an-
f imal into contact with two females
? kept in a Yugoslavian zoo.

The park, affiliated with the San
Diego Zoo, was established 16 years
ago when the zoo found itself un-
able to maintain its world-famous

, collections because many creatures

were dying — often because of

_ worsening conditions in their habi-

tats.

“You can’t send a collector into a
war zone,” Killmar said. “You don’t
have much luck telling starving

* people in the Third World that they

shouldn’t eat a particular animal
because it’s rare. And you abso-
lutely can’t trap an animal once its
species is extinct.” '
Despite the critics’ reservations,
he said, the captive breeding pro-
gram has done a lot of good. He said
the park’s biggest successes have
been with the Arabian’oryx, a spe-
cies of antelope, and with the
Przewalski’s wild horse, an ex-
tremely rare animal from the Chi-
nese-Mongolian border area.

- The San Diego park’s effort be-
gan with just two of these horses,
but it now has 56 and is negotiating
with Chinese authorities to release

 

most of them into their native habi-

tat, Killmar said.

San Diego scientists already
have returned 28 Arabian oryxes to
their original habitats in the Per-
sian Gulf sheikdom of Oman, as
well as in Jordan and Israel, he said.
All told, ' 168 of these exotic an-
telope, which have long spiraling
horns, have been born in the park’s
program.

‘ The endangered menagerie here
also crosses many warring ideologi-
cal lines, underscoring just how
fragile the hopes for some species
remain in a troubled and ever more
crowded world, Killmar said. After .
successfully breeding 303 desert an-
telope called addaxes, the San Diego
park shipped most of them to their
native habitats in Tunisia, Libya
and Israel.

“A cat is a nice sophisticated animal and

said Earl Cavanah, executive vice president

running ad campaign that has made 9-Lives

cat food a household name. Although Morris
was hardly the only cat peddling products,
the others were relegated to “soft goods” like
bedding, lingerie and cosmetics, the sorts of
items that advertisers thought could use a
cat’s soft touch. Cats have never been as
popular as dogs in advertising, but that’s
changing.

By the latest whisker count, cats, for the
first time, now outnumber dogs in American
households. According to the Pet Food Insti-
tute, there were 56 million cats in American
homes last year, and 52 million dogs. And
they’re doing more than just snoozing on the
couch: They’re advertising everything from
high-priced cars and business machines to
communications systems, health insurance,
diet soda and sleeping aids. Among the com-
panies that have turned to cats to pitch their
goods are the Marine Midland Bank, Swis-
sair, Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield, Diet
Coke and even its archrival, Diet Pepsi.

“Studies show that the average American
is bombarded with anywhere from 400 to
3,000 ads a day, so advertisers have to get
your attention somehow,” said Jacob Jacoby,
the Merchants Council Professor of Consum-
er Behavior at New York University’s busi-
ness school. “If cats are in 56 million house-
holds, then you’re trying to sell information
to those 56 million households automatical-
ly.” Dr. Shelly Chaiken, an associate profes-
sor at New York University in social psychol-

ogy, added: “Old people and young people
have cats, and you can slice across the mar-
ket. It’s not necessarily a rational appeal.”

There may also be something more subtle
at work, said Ethel Tobach, adjunct profes-
sor of psychology at Hunter College and
curator of the AmeriCan Museum of Natural
History’s department of mammalogy.
“There are the old stereotypes that equate a
man with a dog and a woman with a cat,” she
said. “Advertisers in general are trying to
make more appeals to women.”

Whatever the motivation, advertisers
seem to believe that cats can sell. At Canon
U.S.A., the big camera and office equipment
company, executives even went so far as to
name a new product the Cat: ,The company
calls the Canon Cat a “work processor” — a
combination typewriter and ward processor
— and advertises it with the help of an
aristocratic-looking cat named Drake.

CAT “has sort of a mystique about it,”
A said Paul Denimark, who handles Cat
marketing at Canon USA. When Can-
on’s advertising agency, Grey Advertising,
proposed the name, Canon agreed. An addi-
tional motivation, he said, was the fact. that
the machine is so unusual that most people,
at first, do not know what it will do — just as
they do not know what a real cat will do.
Like most advertising decisions, it. was not
made lightly — and it drew its share of in-

the catnip crowd. It was Morris’s machis-

mo that supposedly prompted Leo Bur-

nett U.S.A. in 1969 to choose him

Over other cats to represent 9-Lives Cat
' Food, a division of Star-KistFoods Inc.

The selection of Morris began a market-

ing legend.

But times ~—' and Morris — are chang-
ing. “It used to be that the relationship
between owner and cat was not real
warm,” said Bill Johnson, group
vice president of the pet food division of
Star-Kist, a subsidiary of the H. J. Heinz
Company. ”But as the single life-style
and dual-households developed,
the pet has developed into a surrogate
for a child or other family members.
There is now a cozier, warmer, more
comfortable relationship” between cats
and owners.

So in future commercials, Star-Kist is
considering changing Morris’s image.

He will be less self-centered and
grumpy, more sensitive and open. Unlike
his previous 80 commercials, Morris may
be seen, lovingly, with his owner.

The idea, of course, is to create better
feelings about Morris so cat owners will
buy 9-Lives pet food. Over the years
Star-Kist, which owns Morris, has spent
about $1 million on Morris advertising
and promotions. Mr. Johnson acknow-
Ieged that Morris’s effect on pet food
sales is difficult to track, but he
said that sales have steadily increased
since Morris made his debut in 1969. 9-
Lives leads the canned cat food industry,
with an estimated $264 million in
sales in 1987, 23 percent of the market.

If Morris has been good for 9-Lives, 9-
Lives was a life-saver -- literally — for
Morris. Actually there have been two
Morrises. The first was 20 min—
utes from death in an East Coast animal
shelter in 1966 when he was saved by an
animal trainer and talent scout, Bob
Martwick, who became Morris’s person-
al trainer.

That cat died in 1977 at the age of 17.
But Morris’s product identification with

9-Lives was so strong that Star-Kist de-
cided to find a second Morris. In 1980
Morris ll assumed the mantle of Ameri-
ca's leading spokescat. Star-Kist says
that no one accused the company

of being disrespectful to the orginal Mor-
ris by replacing him with a duplicate. De-
spite the current Morris’s runaround
schedule — in the last two years he has

traveled more than 100,000 miles and

made 50 personal appearances — the
company insiststhere is still only

one Morris, not several orange cats
bounding around the country like so
many Elvis impersonators.

Some animal cartoon characters, like
Garfield the Cat and Opus the Penguin,
have made a great deal of money for
their owners through licensing, but Star-
Kist has not used Morris in that fashion.

“We’re concerned about abdicating
his standing as 9~Lives spokesman, but
we may have made a mistake in that re-
gard,” Mr. Johnson said. Ponder-
ing the 19-inch, 14-pound orange cat, he
concluded, “There may be a lot of un-
tapped equity in that asset."

house criticism. “I fought the campaign tooth
and claw because I am deathly afraid of
cats,” said Joan Rainaldi, a national training
manager at Canon. She has since come
around, however. “I have to admit that it
couldn’t have worked better,” she said.

The print campaign started in September
with full-body shots of Drake and a single line
of copy on one page: “The Canon Cat is
Coming Then the reader can Open or
turn the page to see Drake leaping, a graphic
way to illustrate the Cat’s pink “leap” keys,
which enable the machine’s user to move
through the text. In a reader survey done by
Readex Inc., the ad scored highest — 83
percent — in the “remembered seeing” cate-
gory when it appeared in the October issue of

The Office magazine.

While Drake is clearly hustling his prod
uct, other ad cats are taking a more low~key
approach. In a series of commercials that
began last year for Sominex sleeping pills, a
calico cat named Bridget ends up asleep on
her owner’s bed.

“The animal could have become the star of
the commercial or the message could have
been conveyed without the cat; we are, after
all, selling a sleep product, not a cat.,” said
Neal Heller, product manager of Sominex,
which is owned by Beecham Products Inc.
“But here it adds value.”

Steve Baer, a former senior writer at
Ogilvy & Mather, which produced the com-
mercial, recalled, “Originally we had just
two people going to bed, but we put the cat in
as a thread or as punctuation points.” In the
ad, Bridget walks into a room at bedtime, is
put out for the night but comes back and is
allowed to curl up on the bed.

When New York Telephone decided to do a
series of radio and television ads to highlight
the importance of telephone lines to every-
day life, it decided a cat could help tell the
story. In one ad, a cat is perched on his
master’s shoulder, peering intently at a com-

, puter screen. In a radio ad, a neighbor Calls
to ask an elderly woman if she needs any-
thing from the store; it turns out that Whis-

kers — and her new litter -— need milk.
“We were looking at how to enhance situa-

tions, " said Robert McDuffey, an art director

at Young 81 Rubicam, who did one of the ads.
The allure of the cat is hardly restricted to

'Madison Avenue. In Japan, the Nippon Tele-

graph and Telephone Corporation sent‘ a
crew to New York about two years ago to
make television spots of a cat roaming the
city, observing urban activity. The idea, ac-
cording to Merrill Aldighieri, an art director
at C0- Directions in New York, who cast the
cat, was that people would identify with this
lone cat, miss a loved one and call home.

auditioned dozens of cats, casting a sil-
ver tabby by the name of Tyrone Fletch-
er. In the ads, Tyrone observed pigeons from
a Manhattan rooftop, visited restaurants,
sniffed around on a kitchen counter and ran
down ladders and across brick walls. With
music by the Japanese composer Go Oh-
gami, the commercials had the quality of a
music video. The company followed with
another series, also featuring a cat. ..
Tyrone seemed a likely choice for,,,,.the
assignment. One of the best-known ad cats in
the business, he has made more than 40
commercials,.appeared on the “Today” 'Sgiow
and “The David Letterman Show,” accord.

Duck nests at nursing home

Fowl finds
special place
with residents
By Gretchen Schulz

South Gwinnett Bureau

SNELLVILLE —- For the time be-
ing, he’s just known as “the duck.”

But the newest resident of the Snell-

ville Nursing and Rehabilitation Cen-
ter will not go nameless for long. The
nursing home is now in the midst of a
“name-the-duck contest” for its web-
footed friend who seems to feel more
comfortable with humans than his
own feathered relatives.

Mark Cobb, activity director at the
center, said the duck just appeared
one day in the parking lot at the nurs-
ing home, which overlooks the lake at
Briscoe Park. Cobb guesses that the
young duck may have been an Easter
pet that became a little too large for
someone to keep in their home.
‘ “Probably somebody just dropped
him off at the lake.”

Twice the nursing home staff has
taken the duck back to the lake.
Twice the duck has waddled back to
the nursing home, refusing to stay at
the lake.

And his insistence on staying at the
nursing home has earned the duck a
place in the hearts of the residents
and staff. “He falls asleep at the resi-
dents’ feet on the porch,” Cobb said.
“We’ve decided we’ve just got to
keep him.”

Smart duck. Residents are no long-
er sending their leftover cornbread
and rolls back to the nursing home
kitchen on their plates. The leftovers
are wrapped in napkins and given to
the duck to supplement his regular
diet of dried corn. And recently the
nursing home bought its feathered
friend a child’s plastic swimming
pool, which is kept in the fenced-in
yard at the home.

The duck has now become the big-

gest attraction on two webbed feet.
Some residents sit for hours by the
duck’s pool, watching as he swims
and dives. Those who can’t get out-
side, the duck visits personally, wad-
dling down the nursing home halls,
stopping to quack at residents along
the way.

“You can’t help but smile at him.
And that’s just what you need in a
nursing home,” Cobb said. “He’s bet-

ter than a puppy because he doesn’t
jump up on the residents. He lets

, them hold him.”

David Brooks, one of the residents
who was sitting by the duck’s pool,
agreed. “He’s something. He’s good
company,” he said, picking up the
duck.

Watching as Brooks stroked the
duck, Cobb said, “He’ll get more love
than any duck in this world.”

For more than a quarter of an hour, Rob-

Fresh Water Fish Commission, has been
sitting in the fading light under a bridge in
Coral Gables, hearing nothing but what the
human ear can pick up: frogs and crickets,
and the cars, bicycles and walkers over-

thing is whipping back and forth in the
night.

_ Robson has warned he is “looking for a

ghost” - the mastiff bat, not seen in Flori-
da in 10 years, and not in the Gables for
nearly 25. For all anybody knows, it no
longer exists. But Robson is on a fingers-
- crossed expedition, hoping to find the crea-
ture still flapping around its old haunts.

water shivers with the movement of dart-
ing insects. But above, nothing stirs.

“This is the kind of place we’d likely find
them,” says the tall, affable wildlife biolo-
gist.

“This creek goes across to that golf
course, and the tower,” the tower being the
pinnacle of the Biltmore Hotel, or “bat
central in the old days.”

Robson has talked to those who say the
once-derelict hotel was full of bats. Now
restored and flaring like a Roman candle
on the horizon, no sane bat would claim it
as a roost. . I

Three nights a month, after driving
about 65 miles from his West Palm Beach
home, Robson stalks the empty golf
courses and narrow canal banks of the Ga-
bles, looking and listening for the mysteri-
ous mastiff (order chiroptera, meaning
winged hand. Despite appearances, it, like
all bats, is related more to primates than
rodents.)

As usual, Robson began this day with a
round of phone calls: to the city manager,
to the parks director, to pest control com-
panies, to chimney sweeps, to anyone, in
short, who might give him a lead. And, as
usual, the initial response was either giddy
laughter or baffled silence.

A good- -humored sort, Robson has
learned to cope with the incredulity and
the ribbing. But there are limits: “Nobody
calls me Batman. I don’t want to be called

' .ifrom the southern end of Lake

I BAT BOOSTING I

Mark Robson of the Game
and Fresh Water Fish Commis-
sion asks that anyone with
knowledge of bat roosting areas
give him a call. "l'm interested in
any kind of bet at all." he says.
Do not call just to tell him you
saw a bat llying around. be-
cause that’s not helpful. But if
you know of an old building or
tree where they are roosting dur-
ing the day. or you see them fly-
ing out of the same around
dusk, call 1-800-432-2046.

 

 

 

flight pattern. The mastiff, on the
other hand, is known for its
straight-line navigation. The friend
thinks he saw a hat, but it was fly-
ing 200 to 300 feet overhead, mak-
ing nighttime identification impos-
sible.

“Where it was coming from or
going,” Robson says, “we have no
idea.”

In Coral Gables, Robson centers
his search around water, old build-
ings and large trees, of which the
Gables has an abundance.

Tonight, he’s hoping he’s in a bat
foraging area. He has his newly ac-
quired, $200 QMC bat detector set
at 35 kilohertz (the range for bats 1s
20 to 60 kHz, he says, and the mas-

tiff is supposed to be in the 30 to 40
zone).

Depending on the frequency se-
lected, the little device can pick up
insects and, as Robson discovers

this night, squeaky bicycle chains

as well.
I

Robson never has checked out
this particular spot before. The
night is perfect for bats, warm and
without breeze. Earlier, a fisher-
man on the bank confirmed that
“there by the ridge, you’ll see ’em
all right. There’s lots of bats, once
it gets dark.”

“Could be the evening bat or the
Brazilian free—tailed bat,” Robson
notes as he climbs down the steep
embankment.

For the past 15 minutes, Robson
has been switching the bat machine
off and on. And now, suddenly, the
device erupts with sound.

Robson’s being cool, saying noth-

g.

“Sure sounds like something,”
says a companion.

Minutes go by and the trill and
the clock continue.

“I don’t see anything,” Robson
says, walking down the embank-
ment to peer up at a streetlight.
Bats sometimes will work the bugs
attracted by streetlights.

“Maybe its a cricket,” Robson

says, maintaining his scientific
skepticism.

The sound continues to weave in
and out, never fading entirely, but
falling off as as though moving
away and then returning. Twenty
minutes after the sound begins,
Robson concedes, “That sure could
be a bat.

“It’s hawking,” he says -

But a few minutes later, the un-
certainty returns. “1 think it’s an in-
sect. The only thing, it seems to
come and go. But that’s.probably
an insect,” he concludes, still trying
to see into the darkness.

It’s nearly 9 pm, and Robson is
anxious to check out three other lo-
cations —— all along a golf course.
“Let’s go,” he says.

“Bats like open areas, too,” he
explains, getting out of his van at a
site near Alhambra Circle “Five
years ago a local pest control com-
pany had a complaint about bats
right over there," he says, pointing
to a house on the other side of the
fairways. Nobody knows what kind 7
of bats.‘

At each of the three stops, the
chatter and buzz of insects is heard.
But the bat detector remains silent.

If Robson comes up empty-hand-
ed in the Gables, he’ll move the
search to wildlife areas such as
Everglades National Park, and the
J.W. Corbett and Cecil M. Webb
wildlife management areas.
“There’s not been as much Spray-
ing in those areas [some research-
ers think pesticides have helped re-
duce the at population] and there
are a lot of roast cavities, " be ex-
plains

Had a bat been spotted this night,
Robson’s next step would have
been to try to locate the roost.

Robson will continue his search
through July. After that, a decision
will be made on whether to intensi-
fy the effort. ,

“I’ll be making some kind of rec-
ommendation on listing of the bat,
based on information we’ve got --
or lack of information,” he says.

Ironically, though the 'mastiff
hasn’t been seen in a decade, nei-
ther state nor-federal agencies
have yet labeled it threatened, en-
dangered or even a species of Spe-
cial concern.

“Regardless of what I find,”
Robson says, “more work is going
to have to be done. Just because I
don’t find anything doesn’t mean
the animal is extinct.”

In the meantime, he is going
back to the canal bank where he
picked up the trills and clucks. So
far, it’s all he has to go on.

Animal rights activists placed the slgas ‘
in an attempt to teens public attention on ;

an arrangement in which the DeKalb
County Animal Shelter supplies Emory

University medical research labs with 11":

animals scheduledto be deStroyed. In
keeping with Current policy, the DeKalb

Dr. Noel Lehner of the Animal

center gets animals from the posted, but
said he didn’t think they had gotten

“The only way we would have their
animal was if it were picked up by
DeKalb County and it exceeded its time
limit at the shelter. .As far as we
know we have never had anybody’ 5 pet, ”
Lehner said.

But DeKalb County Commissioner
Sherry Schulman, who has worked to stop
the animal diversion practice isn’t
convinced.

“I think those signs are very accurate
and help citizens because it could just
deﬁnitely be true,“ she said, citing the
possibility of a pet being picked up while
its owners were on vacation.

“If a dog were picked up on a Monday,
it could be at Emory by the weekend, "
Schulman argued. .

‘Theltmmalssometlmesmnduplnthe'

 

shelter doesn t always wait the mandatory
five days before giving up an animal - a
matter about which she has raised official
complaints.

Some animal rights activists have
speculated that the use of animals for

research at Emory encourages the nabbing

of pets by people who sell them to the
university. But Dr. lehner said this is not
possible because the Animal Resource
Center uses only pound animals provided
to them at no cost and “purpose- -“bred
animals bought from labbratory animal

dealers.

“We don’ t accept animals from private
parties and we don t accept (donated
animals) tn any way," Dr. Lehner said.

But, nonetheless, animal rights
proponents and Schulman want the
practice stopped. DeKalb County is the
last of the nine metro counties to provide
labs with research animals.

Schulman lS upset by the fact that
researchers are allowed to use animals in
experiments. The Animal Welfare Act.
which dictates the manner in which lab
animals must bekept, offers an animal no
protection after it enters the lab, she said.

“Once an animal is taken into the lab
and the experiment has begun, all deals
are off,” she said. “They don‘t even have
to anesthetize the animal. . . . It’s

barbaric and outmoded and, yes, I would "

like to see it stopped tomorrow.”

Dr. Lehner said Emory has no wish to
experiment with anyone’s pet and that the
Animal Resource Center carefully checks
when someone inquires about a lost
animal. If a person '8 animal has been
missing long enough to be picked up by
animal control and turned over to the
university, and there is reason to believe
the animal mightbe there, the center '
invites people to come and look for their
pet. If a pet should turn up at the center,

Dr. Lehner said, the animal will be
released.

“If somebody describes a dog, we go
back and check our inventory and our
records ” said Dr. Lehner If we have one

description, we have the people come over,
and identify them.“ '

Though Ms. Echulman doesn’t know

who posted the signs, she said they have
violated no laws and she supports the
efforts to let more people know of the
ppssible fate of lost pets.

“Who would ever think of calling them

somebody put up those signs.’ she said. “I
think it is a good idea. because it is good
information for the community.“ Cl.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - May 31, 1988

'Air Animal caters to pets on the
move

By ALINA MATAS
Tribune Business Writer

TAMPA — When people move
they find a way to wrap and pack
their china, books, clothes and ste-
reo. But when it comes to their
cat, dog, goldfish or’parakeet, they
quickly realize that newspapers
and cardboard boxes just won’t do.

Even moving companies don’t
offer much help.

But a Tampa couple saw a way
to fill that void: They opened a
company that transfers animals
whose owners are relocating.

Air Animal Inc., a Tampa-
based mixed breed of moving
company and travel agency for
pets, caught on to the needs of Fi-
do, Fluffy and Tweety. With a
friendly “leave-it-to-me” attitude,
the company sells travel contain-
ers for pets, arranges airline con-
nections, and provides courier and
ground-transportation services. If
a pet needs a health certificate or
vaccination, they do it in-house.

Veterinarian Walter Woolf
started the company in 1977 with
his wife, Millie, now company

president. With a gross annual in-
come now in six figures (though

he won’t be more specific), Walter A

Woolf looks back to the begin-
nings, and smiles.

. It took staying power, he says,
financially and emotionally.

“We had to make some things
happen,” Woolf says. “We had to
convmce the public that it was
safe to do it. We had to convince
the airlines it was OK to do it. And
we had to make it profitable.”

At their headquarters at 4120
;W. Cypress St., the operation looks

easy, although the Woolfs work 60
to 70 hours each week.

One of the rooms in the Woolf
Animal Hospital, which they have
owned and operated for 27 years,
is a “try-on” room, where pets can
check which of 13 sizes of travel
containers fit best.

The “travel agency” is in that .

same room. With a personal com-
puter she bought a year and a half
ago, Millie Woolf quickly figures
out air travel rates. Sending a cat

from Tampa to Portland, Ore., for example, would cost
$185, including Air Animal’s service fee. A Rottweiler
would cost about $440. The price goes up as the size of
the pet increases because air cargo charges are based
on the size of containers.

The moving-travel agency for pets grew out of the
animal hospital in a logical way. A service the Woolfs
were providing for free since 1969 gave them the idea.

“In 1969, as people were returning from Southeast
Asia and Europe, their animals would show up here
before they would,” Woolf said. “National Airlines
would call us and say: ‘We have a dog here and no-
body's here to get it. Will you come and get it?’ ”

Woolf said that after getting those calls for several
years, finally “the light bulb flashed.” In 1977 Air Ani-
mal officially went into the business of relocating pets.
In their first month they sold two travel kennels.

“The first month’s gross income was March of 1977;
it was $47. I said. ‘Next month’s gotta be better than
this.’ And it was," Walter Woolf recalled.

Woolf said he followed some simple financial ad-
Vice.

“Control your expenses and increase your income,”
he said. “It sounds so simple, but many people don’t do
it.”

Millie Woolf said domestic airlines don't pay them a
commission for shipping animals with them, although
two international airlines do, but at a lower rate than
they pay travel agencies for booking people.

In 11 years Air Animal has grown from a local
relocation service to a national and international relo-
cation agent. Its only truck, which displays a colorful
illustration of a hot-air balloon with a dog, a cat and a
parrot seated in the gondola, is used for local pick-ups
and deliveries. But the “mom-and-pop” operation uses a
pet-movers network they’ve developed, and in that way
it manages the relocation of animals across the nation
and overseas.

.“Our driver went to Lakeland yesterday to pick up a
dog that was boarding at an animal hospital. The family
had'moved already. Earlier this morning we delivered
it at the airport and it will be in Duluth, Minnesota, this
afternoon,” says Woolf, describing a typical day.

It was more complicated than that, Millie Woolf
says,.thumbing through her frequently used atlas. The
final destination was Dollar Bay, Mich, where the only
planes that land are small ones that cannot handle live
freight. Arrangements had to be made for ground trans-

. portation from Duluth.

While the trip to Dollar Bay was a challenge for Air
Animal, there have been more exotic destinations. Two

cats, Max and Buffy, had to move to London; owner

Lucy Hoyt called Air Animal for help.

“We didn’t know any of the rules that were required
to get a pet overseas, and it turned out that London had
a six-month quarantine,” Hoyt said.

. Hoyt said all she had to do was bring the cats to the
Air Animal office. The next time she saw them they
were in the quarantine center in London, where they
had arrived in good condition.

Just' as the arrangements they sometimes handle,
some pet-owner relationships are equally unusual and
amusing. There was the case, for example, of a parrot
and its owner going to Japan.

“The gentleman showed up one Friday morning and
said: ‘I’m going to Japan next week; I need ahealth
certificate,’ ” Walter Woolf recalls.

Parrots are protected by an international treaty,
and the traveler didn’t know he needed an import per-
mit and an export permit. The Woolfs had to process it
all in a few days. But it was worth the effort to see the
trick the man had taught his parrot, they said.

“He would point his finger at the parrot, say ‘Bang!
Bangl’, and the parrot would swing around his finger
without letting go, playing dead," Millie Woolf recalls
amusediy.

Ekk-Wiii Tropical Fish Farm Inc., a Tampa-based
company that sells tropical fish, exported 3,000 fish to
Germany._T he fish farm has been using Air Animal as
a freight agent for five years, marketing director Mi-
chael Henessy said.

"We have a very workable relationship and we use
them a lot of times when we're shipping to Western
Europe and the Far East," Henessy said.

Along with the enjoyment, the business has its frus-
trations, the Woolfs say.

“Our business is only as good as the airlines that we
use," Walter Woolf said. “Sometimes they miss a flight.
Sometimes the flight is canceled. That happened today.
So you just have to stop what you're doing and figure
out what you’re going to do.”

Millie Woolf, who handles the documentation of ani-
mals going overseas, said she gets her share of aggrava—
tions on the telephone finding answers from foreign
consulates.

"We shipped two birds to Morocco. We got five dif-
ferent answers to what kind of documentation they
needed,” she said.

The Wooifs say they enjoy what they do and take
pride in their good reputation among customers and
other businesses. They say they're glad to see a few
similar businesses emerging in the Tampa area. Their
biggest competition, they say, remains the airlines that
ship the animals.

“We have no plans for expansion," Woolf said. “We
run a good store. We’re good at what we do and we

plan to keep good.”

F OR THE LOVE OF SNAKES

 

By STEPHEN d’OLlVEIRA
Staff Writer

Nine-year-old Johnny Long and his
good friend Brian Thompson look and act
like typical boys.

This suspicion was confirmed on Satur-
day when the Plantation youngsters pro-
claimed their fondness for snakes at the
\ Secret Woods Nature Center.

“I like ’em,” said Brian. “My mom
hates ’em.”

“They’re cool,” Johnny said.

The boys were among 150 children and
adults who attended the nature center’s
first hands-on snake exhibition at
Broward County’s woodsy 37-acre park
SnIState Road 84 west of Fort Lauder-

a e.

A hands-on exhibition at the Secret Woods
Nature Center attracts lovers of serpents
that slide and slither.

phen Lenberger pulled one snake after
another out of aquariums, boxes and can-
vas bags. The crowd gasped when he in-
troduced “Mr. T,” a 15-foot, 80-pound
Burmese python.

Lenberger, the park’s manager, talked
about the feeding and reproductive habits
of Everglades snakes,’orange-colored rat
snakes, king snakes, corn snakes and all
types of pythons.

“There are snakes everywhere,” he
said. “There are probably some living in
downtown Fort Lauderdale I could find.”

Lenberger said some species tame
more easily than others, but all snakes
are carnivorous and most swallow their
prey live. Some eat rats, some eat mice,
some eat frogs. Some snakes even eat oth-
er snakes.

“Snakes are not slimy; they’re rep-
tiles,” he said.

Northeast High School juniors David
Hape, 16, and Derek Sedlack, 18, each
keep pet snakes at home.

Since finding the snakes in their back
yards last year, they have read about ev-

ery book they could find on the subject. So
attending Saturday’s snake exhibition
seemed the natural thing to do.

“The snake fever bit us,” said Sedlack,
a Fort Lauderdale resident.

He then offered a defense of the misun-
derstood creatures. '

“Snakes don’t deserve the bad rap
they’re given,” said Sedlack.

Hope, a Pompano Beach resident, said
he was trying to teach his mother not to
be afraid to handle his pet snake, Eric,
should she ever come across it.
