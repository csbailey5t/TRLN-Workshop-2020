The Society’s ultimate aim is to secure the
legal protection and State control of British
Wild-life and the legal abolition of all forms
of killing for sport; its immediate object
is to educate public opinion to demand
the suppression of the hunting and coursing
of our native wild animals—Deer, Fox,
Otter, Badger, Hare, etc.

NATIONAL SOCIETY FOR
THE ABOLITION OF CRUEL SPORTS
ANNUAL REPORT
1958

ESPITE the troubled international political situation the Society

D increased its propaganda work in 19 38. The crisis of September

naturally affected us very adversely, in various ways, but
nevertheless we can record a steady increase of membership.

The Council regretted to lose the services of Mr. P. E. Hurst,
through death, and of Mr. J. F. Forbes who resigned owing to pressure
of other work. The vacancies were ﬁlled by Mr. E. G. Barlow and
Miss A. L. Williams. Seven meetings were held during the year.

Six of our Vice—Presidents died, in 1938, and four were elected,
namely, Miss Naomi Jacob, Sir William Rothenstein, Mr. Frank
Swinnerton, and Sir Evelyn Wrench.

The sum of £3 50, in part payment of a legacy, was received from
the estate of the late Miss O. J. M. Rose, a Life Member.

The Annual General Meeting was held at the Conway Hall,
London, on March 16th, Mr. H. G. Chancellor in the chair. The
Annual Report for 1937 and the statement of accounts having been
adopted, the retiring ofﬁcers and Council for the ensuing year were
elected en bloc. On the motion of the Chairman, it was unanimously
agreed that an addition with far-reaching implications should be
made to the Society’s Object as printed on the Rules. This was
extended so as to read :

“ The ultimate object of the Society is to secure the total
abolition of the killing of animals for sport, and the legal protection
and State control of British wild life.”

In December, owing to the demolition of part of Tavistock Square,
the Society was forced to seek another ofﬁce. Circumstances beyond
our control rendered the ﬁnding of suitable premises a difﬁcult problem,
and a decision had ﬁnally to be made at very short notice. We were
fortunately able to secure a new a'nd more commodious ofﬁce in a
most convenient situation—though, of course, at a higher rent than
we had been paying.

During the year the Society completed its undertaking to circularise,
withthe Junior Series leaﬂets, the Elementary Schools of England and
Wales, amounting to about 30,000 in all. At a meeting of the Rayleigh
Rural District Council, it was decided that a supply of the leaﬂets should
be accepted for distribution among local school-children. Thus
Rayleigh comes into line with other councils who have shewn their

practical sympathy with the movement to protect wild creatures from
cruelty.

The Outlook

Despite some appearances to the contrary, the outlook has never
been so favourable for our cause. In our last Annual Report we stressed
the growth, throughout the country, of Press controversies on hunting.
There are now probably a dozen newspapers which will allow open
criticism of blood—sports, for every one a generation ago. It is signiﬁ—
cant that our pamphlet, Fox/.mnters’ sz'losop/yy, was widely and appre-
ciatively reviewed in the provincial Press. These facts alone are strong
testimony to the value of the propaganda which has been carried on so
vigorously by various societies since the war of 1914—18, following
the pioneer work of the Humanitarian League * during the early
part of the century. All branches of hunting and coursing have thus
come in for severe criticism, often in unexpected quarters.

Another symptom of the growth of public interest in the con-
troversy on blood-sports is the increased number of debates, to which
reference is made later.

There are other indications, too, that the cordon is now slowly
drawing in on hunting ; and it seems probable that, when the inter-
national situation improves, there will be a better hearing than was
ever before possible for parliamentary bills to prohibit blood—sports.

In the early part of the year, much public interest was aroused by
the prosecution by the R.S.P.C.A. of a northern Master of Fox—hounds
for alleged cruelty in hunting (although the charge was not proved
to the satisfaction of the Bench), and the case of an Essex hunt where
a chimney sweep’s gear was used to prod a fox out of a drain in a
public road. Some reﬂection of the powerful impression made by
these cases is perhaps to be seen in a very curious section of the British '
Field Sports Society’s Annual Report (1937—8), which is, in effect, an
appeal to hunters to keep down the number of diggings—out. In short,
it is evident that there is a considerable difference of feeling among
fox—hunters themselves on the question of the fair—play of digging—out.
It will be found, however, that this is a custom which it is virtually
impossible to eliminate from the sport of hunting.

A favourite argument of fox—hunters is that if their sport ceased
the fox would be “ exterminated.” This is obviously a mere wish-
fathering-thought prediction. The truth is that the fox is a necessary
species in the order of nature, and we should greatly deplore any
attempts to exterminate it. Foxes are, however, not necessary when
“ preserved ” in numbers, as in some districts where their status is
entirely artiﬁcial—as is well symbolised by the “ artiﬁcial earths ”
made for them. On this point an interesting letter appears in Tbe
News“ Clyrom'cle of May 17th by a Wiltshire correspondent, who stated
that “ foxes are usually considered a pest in country districts, and
hunting is welcomed as a means of keeping them down. But in one

district of Wiltshire I know foxes are exceedingly common, as the
country, being very heavily wooded, makes hunting impossible. .
Moreover, the foxes keep down the rabbits to a remarkable degree.
In neighbouring districts the rabbits are an appalling pest, and sooner
or later expensive measures will have to be taken to destroy them.
It is too often forgotten that foxes take their place in the balance of
Nature. They should therefore be preserved so as to prevent the
deterioration of the land which rabbits inevitably bring about.”

The Spurious Sports Bill

In an interview, in February, touching the Protection of Animals’
Bill (No. I) the Honorary Secretary made the following statement on
behalf of the Society :

“ Even if the Bill should now fail again, as on previous occasions,
it seems likely, despite the strongly organised opposition, that it will
be passed before very long, for the harrying of captive wild animals
(in effect prisoners) must be repugnant to an informed public’s sense
of decency. The Bill is indeed only a logical extension of the laws of
prohibiting the chasing for sport of domestic animals and of the
century-old Acts against bull, bear, and badger baiting, of which
amusements rabbit-coursing in enclosed spaces and the hunting of
the park-kept deer (the victims in each case being released from conﬁne-
lined“: for the occasion) are clearly only vestigial survivals in the social

0 y.

“ The carted deer hunt (in which the hunters do not seek to kill
their quarry) is, strange to say, about the least popular of British
‘ ﬁeld sports ’ and the one held in lowest repute by sportsmen them-
selves, some of whom even publicly decry it. The semi-domesticated
deer, thus harried, are subject to frequent deplorable so-called ‘ acci—
dents,’ being impaled on spiked railings, driven into the sea, or even
into dwelling-houses, and so forth.” (See T196 Mam/Jen‘er Guardiaﬂ,
25/2/1938)-

It is shocking to have to record that the Bill, introduced in the
House of Commons, on February 25th, by Colonel Nathan, M.P., was
counted out. Nevertheless, this Bill, styled a “ hardy annual ” by the
British Field Sports Society, will doubtless make a further appearance.

Publications

In addition to the Annual Report for 1937 the Society has issued
the following publications :

OTTERS AND MEN. H. E. Bates. 14’.
THE PLEASURE 0F KILLING. Miss L. Lind-af—Hageby. Id.
FOXHUNTERS’ PHILOSOPHY. Edited by Bertram Lloyd. 34’.

A HANDBILL-LEAFLET with the wording of our poster—Setting
a Dog on a Cat 18 Cruelty : Setting Thirty Dogs on a Fox is Sport.

A fourth edition of Arthur L. Salmon’s THE BEASTS THAT PERISH
was printed and 1,000 copies of this pamphlet were sent to Devon and
Somerset councillors and teachers.

A further 10,000 copies of THE SLAUGHTER OF BEAUTY : OTTER—
HUNTING, now in its thirtieth thousand, were printed.

The thanks 0f the Council are again due to Mr. Neave Parker
for his design for an envelope-back stamp and for a triangular “ Stop
Cruel Sports ” sign to afﬁx inside motor car windows.

Twelve numbers of the monthly BULLETIN were issued.

Humane Education in Schools

All the elementary and a great number of secondary schools
throughout the country have now received our Junior Series leaﬂets,
most of which were written by Miss Jessey Wade, the editor of T126
Little Animal/5’ Friend. Of these, well over 6 50,000 have been circu-
lated to schools, and County and Borough Education Authorities.
The value of this Series, which is designed not only to point out
the cruelties involved in sport but also to teach a respect for wild
life among children, was again demonstrated during the year by
appreciative letters received at the office from teachers and from children
themselves.

Public Meetings and Debates

As in old days with the agitation for abolition of the Slave Trade,
so now with the question of blood—sports, the steady increase in the
number of debates (in all kinds of organisations) is a very encouraging
portent for us.

The Annual General Meeting of the Society on March 16th was
followed by an open lantern lecture by Mr. Douglas English, a
Vice—President of the Society, who was the proposer in the BBC.
debate “ Should blood-sports be abolished?” a year ago. The
lecturer’s interesting address and admirable photographs of our native
mammals were much appreciated by members and their friends.

In conjunction with the Oxford and District Society for the
Abolition of Cruel Sports, the Society held a public protest meeting
at the Rodney Hall, Cheltenham, on May 17th, with Mr. H. G.
Chancellor in the chair, the other speakers being Mr. W. A. Sibly,
Headmaster of Wycliffe College, a member of our Council, and
Captain Douglas English.

Cheltenham gave us an uproarious, though by no means hospitable
welcome, for the majority of the audience, which was a “ packed ”
one in both senses of the word, consisted of hunting people and
their dependants whipped up for the occasion. The Chairman had to
face a constant stream of interruption and the varied uncouth noises
uttered by hunting people, their frequent substitute for argument.

Society disclaimed in the local Press liability for this organised
rowdyism, but did not explain the fact that its ringleader was a
representative from Headquarters. Much correspondence from
indignant residents proved that Cheltenham was rather ashamed of
its fox—hunting hooligans and more in sympathy with our aims than
the episode seemed to show. But it advertised our cause better than
a peaceful meeting would have done.

On April 19th, Mrs. D. L. Chapman (Hon. Secretary of the
Oxford Society) addressed the East Oxford Women’s Co-operative
Guild. The audience was very responsive and passed a resolution
' that “ the time has come for the sports of hunting and coursing to be
abolished.”

The Society took a stall, in December, at the Animals’ Fair at the
Central Hall, Westminster. Thanks are due, for help in the management
of the stall, to Mr. A. Monk—Jones and Miss J. Wade, and to Mr. E. G.
Barlow in particular for very effective posters and a striking fox
headpiece.

Mr. A. Monk—Jones, a member of the Council, addressed a
sympathetic groups of “Rover” Scouts at Highbury, on May and, on
the subject of cruelty in hunting.

We were fortunate in again having Douglas English to represent
the Society at a debate “ That blood-sports should be abolished ”
organised by the Over-Seas League, at Over-Seas House, on
October 11th. The opening motion was ably seconded by another
of our members, Mrs. Speedwell Massingham, and opposed by
Mr. K. Diplock, an assistant secretary of the British Field Sports
Society. Mr. Diplock greatly amused the audience by rashly com-
paring what he called the swift death by hunting with the miserable
natural death which wild animals must endure if left alone, thus
implying that hunting people are improving on the Creator’s system.
The voting on the motion was about equal for and against.

The B.B.C. and Hunting

. Owing to widespread dissatisfaction with the attitude of the B.B.C.
in regard to blood—sports as indicated in our last Annual Report, the
following memorial protest letter was forwarded on January 26th
to Sir John Reith, the Director—General. The letter was signed by
.Mr. Keith Robinson (Secretary, Our Dumb Friends’ League),
Mr. R. H. Spurrier (Chairman, National Council for Animals’ Welfare),
our .Hon. Secretary, and over eighty distinguished authors and
publlClStS, many being well—known broadcasters. A copy of the protest
was posted to the editors of 800 journals throughout the country,
the Signatories pointing out in a covering letter that “ the memorial
appears to follow aptly on the recent action of the B.B.C. in banning
a Children’s Hour speech by ‘ Grey Owl’ on the grounds that it
attacked hunting.”

“ Sir,———-The Council of the National Society for the Abolition of
Cruel Sports, the Executive Committees of the National Council for
Animals’ Welfare and Our Dumb Friends’ League, and the under-
signed, desire to draw your attention to the partial attitude adopted by
the British Broadcasting Corporation in regard to blood—sports.

During the past two years the B.B.C. has, on several occasions,
given broadcasts of scenes and reminiscences of hunting, and even one
extolling fox-hunting from the economic point of view. Though
these aroused many protests throughout the country, and though the
B.B.C. received a deputation of humane Societies on the subject, it
has steadfastly refused all requests for some representative broadcast
giving the case against cruel sports, its only move in this direction
being a debate, ‘ Should blood—sports be abolished? ’, broadcast on
19th May, 1957, in which both points of View were represented.

Further, we would point out that there is a large and widespread
body of opinion which regards present-day hunting as a cruel practice
opposed to the whole trend of modern cultural progress and respect
for wild life.

May we, therefore, urge the B.B.C. to give opportunities for
broadcast talks against hunting from the economic and social stand-
point ? ”

The signatories include: George Arliss, James Barr, M.P.,
H. E. Bates, A. D. Belden, S. L. Bensusan, Edmund Blunden,
H. N. Brailsford, Vera Brittain, Gerald Bullett, G. D. H. Cole,

The memorial, which aroused much public interest, evoked a
courteous but highly unsatisfactory reply from the Controller (Public
Relations) on behalf of the B.B.C.

On February 17th, therefore, a further letter, signed, on behalf
of the signatories to the memorial, by those representing the three

9

 




 

 

 

 

co-operating Societies, was addressed to the Controller of Public
Relations. The following passage is extracted from this letter:

“. . . We regret that you have apparently misunderstood the
purport of the signatories’ request, and have in consequence,
sadly misrepresented their views and desires. The Memorial
does not ask that any kind of broadcast on hunting subjects should
be debarred ; it contains no suggestion that the BBC. has allowed
attacks on those opposed to hunting—a point which, indeed, has
never previously been raised. All that is asked for is parityof
treatment, that is to say, that equal opportunities shall be given
to present the case against hunting as have been provided for
pro-hunting broadcasts and ‘ descriptive sketches ’ which are,
in eﬂ’ect, if not ostensibly, a popularisation of the practice of cruel
sports. There is therefore no ground whatever for the suggestion
that ‘ a very widespread censorship of programmes ’ is implied
in the demand of the memorialists. . . .”

A report of the controversy containing the correspondence in full
appeared in 1736 Animals’ Frimd‘for March, 1938.

The Little CW]

The Council congratulates Miss Alice Hibbert—\Ware, a member
of the Society, on her admirable work in connection with the special
Little Owl Food Enquiry (1936—7). Miss Hibbert-Ware undertook
‘ this work, which involved a great deal of labour and research, for the
British Trust for Ornithology, under whose auspices the Report on
the Food of the Little Owl was published this year.

The Little Owl, constantly attacked (especially by sportsmen) for
alleged damage to game-preservers, has served in some sort as a test
(are, and has now been scientiﬁcally rehabilitated.

Obituary

The Council regrets to record the death of a number of valued
members during the year, including six of its Vice-Presidents——
Prof. Lascelles Abercrombie, Prof. A. E. Boycott, Mrs. Andrew
Knowles, Prof. Wm. McDougall, Sir Landon Ronald, and Frances,
Countess of Warwick—and Mr. P. E. Hurst, a member of the Council
since its formation in 19 52.

.Prof. A. E. Boycott, a distinguished pathologist and a gifted
writer and naturalist, was one of the original members of the Society,
in the work of which he had always taken a keen interest. A memoir
appeared in 1796 Time: of May 18th.

The death of Frances, Countess of \Varwick, in July, meant a very
great loss to the whole humanitarian movement. Lady Warwick
had been a Vice—President from the beginning, and was deeply interested
in our efforts to organise public opinion against blood-sports. Obituary
notices of her appeared in The [Mano/Jester Guardian and in other journals.
The following passage is taken from an intimate memoir written by

10

 

 

 




her friend, Miss Margaret Bradish, a member of our Society, which
appeared in T173 Winged Meme/agar for September, an R.S.P.C.A.
publication: “ Her solicitude for animal welfare was incessant,
whether through Parliament, through educational work, clinics, or
social inﬂuence. The instinct to enquire for herself led her to make
many changes in her personal life. She shewed her sincerity in so
doing, and no doubt encountered much opposition and even ridi—
cule. . . . She gave up hunting when she realised the suffering it
involved. . . . On one occasion when the present writer expressed
the fear that she was tired after an exhausting day for animals, her
reply was : ‘ We ought to be tired.’ ”

Prof. Lascelles Abercrombie, the distinguished poet and critic,
had been a Vice—President since 1954, and had often spared time from
his laborious days to assist our work. A memoir of him by his friend
and fellow—poet Wilfrid Gibson (a Vice—President of our Society)
appeared in The Mambeszfer Guardian of 28th October.

The death of Mrs. Andrew Knowles in December was a sad blow
to the Society. A member from the beginning, she was in hearty
sympathy with our aims and deeply interested in our work—towards
which she gave us annually £150. Her counsel was always at our
disposal and was frequently in request.

Catherine Knowles was the widow of a MF.H. and in former
years had ridden regularly to hounds. Being keenly interested in wild-
life protection, she was particularly glad to give specialised information
on fox~hunting to those working for its abolition.

The Oxford Society

. In May, the Oxford Society co-operated with the National Society
In organising the public meeting at Cheltenham.

ll

 

 




 

On April 19th and June Ist, addresses were given by the Hon.
Secretary, Mrs. Chapman, to the East Oxford and Cowley branches
of the Women’s Co—operative Guild. Both audiences showed keen
interest, and at both meetings a resolution was passed condemning
blood—sports. 4

On April 50th, a rummage sale was organised at Hareﬁeld by
Mrs. E. R. White. The proceeds of this, with donations, amounted to
over 7520.

The Society again co—operated with the University Association by
sending literature to ﬁrst year undergraduates.

At the end of the year a special Christmas Card was issued, printed
from an original wood—engraving, representing the episode of
St. Anselm saving a hunted hare. This proved very popular.
