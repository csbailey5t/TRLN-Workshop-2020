August 22, 1991

Mrs. Christine Stevens, President
Animal Welfare Institute

1686 -- 34th Street, N. W.
Washington, D. C. 20007

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

I recently spoke on the phone with your associate, William
Cotreau, after which I sent him some information about the
Klingenstein Fund. As a foundation with a research program in
neuroscience, we also have an interest in the way in which
animals are used in basic research.

Having read with much interest the minority statement you
wrote in an NAS publication on animal research a few years ago,
I would appreciate the opportunity to talk with you when I am
in Washington September 4-6. At the annual meeting of the
Klingenstein Fund to take place this October, we are planning a
panel discussion on the subject of animal research, and I value
your suggestions about how it might be put together.

I will call you in a few days in hopes that we can find a
time to meet. Thank you.

Sincerely,

THE ESTHER A. & JOSEPH
KLINGENSTEIN FUND, INC.

A Brief Description

 




The Klingenstein Fund was established in 1946 by
Esther and Joseph Klingenstein as a vehicle for ex—
pressing their personal philanthropic interests.
During their lifetimes, their deep concern for in—
dividual human welfare was reﬂected in major
grants primarily to those institutions with which
they were personally involved, mostly in the New
York City area.

The Fund’s interests have broadened in recent
years. Currently we have two major programs.
The first is in epilepsy, with primary emphasis on
basic research in neuroscience. The second is in
independent secondary education, where our
principal activity is faculty development through
the Klingenstein Center for Independent Educa-
tion at Teachers College, Columbia University.

In addition to our programs in neuroscience and
independent secondary education, the Fund
makes grants to other organizations and institu—
tions concerned with issues of public policy,
health care, and social welfare. The Fund also con-
tinues to support institutions in which its direc-
tors are personally involved.

Application can be made at any time; no specific
form is required. Applications should include basic
information about the organization; a detailed
description of the proposed project, including a

budget; information about other sources of
support received or sought for the project; the
organization’s latest audited financial statement;
and a copy of its IRS classification. Applications
should be addressed to:

Mr. John Klingenstein, President

The Esther A. & Joseph Klingenstein Fund, Inc.
787 Seventh Avenue, 6th Floor

New York, NY. 10019—6016

The Fund holds Directors’ meetings four or five
times a year. All applicants will be informed in
writing of the action taken by the Fund, whether
or not the proposal is approved.

The Fund makes grants only to tax—exempt

organizations. It does not contribute to endow-
ments and rarely to buildings or other kinds of
capital projects. We ask grantees to submit
substantive and financial reports annually and at
the end of the grant period, and to maintain a
systematic record of payments and receipts
available to the Fund on request.

The Fund does not maintain a mailing list or
publish an annual report. Information from the
Fund’s current tax Form 990-PF is available for in-
spection at the Foundation Center Library, 79 Fifth
Avenue, New York, NY. 10005.

Purpose

The purpose of these awards is to
support young investigators, in the early
stages of their careers, engaged in basic
or clinical research that may lead to a
better understanding of the etiology,
treatment and prevention of epilepsy.

In past years most applicants have
been engaged in research at the molecular
and cellular levels, and the Klingenstein
Fund wishes to continue this emphasis. In
addition, the Fund encourages work in
systems neuroscience for the valuable
perspective it offers to epilepsy research.
The focus of this area is the integrative
function of the nervous system.

Description
of the Program

Up to nine Fellows will be appointed
in 1992. To qualify for an award
investigators must hold the Ph.D. and/or
M.D. degrees, and have completed all
research training, including post-doctoral
training. Applications will be reviewed,
and selections made by an Advisory
Committee of distinguished neuro-
scientists. Applications must be received
by October 15, 1991; awards will be
announced in February, 1992, to
commence July 1, 1992.

As part of the program, there will be
meetings, at approximately two-year

intervals, to discuss research relevant to
the problem of epilepsy. These meetings
will include current Fellows, invited past
Fellows and the Advisory Committee.

Finances

The award of $100,000 is payable
over a three-year period. It may be used
for salary support, research assistants,
equipment, or for any other purpose which
promotes the scientific activities of the
Klingenstein Fellow. An award is for the
exclusive use of the Fellow and may not
be used for institutional or departmental
support. Ho provision is made for
institutional overhead, but fringe benefits
may be charged to the award. Payments
will be made to the investigator’s
institution with the understanding that the
total amount of the award is to be made
available to the Klingenstein Fellow, and
will be transferred should the Fellow
change institutions. Annual reviews of the
Fellow’s activities and the funds disbursed
will be required.

Eligibility

1/(J.S. citizenship is not a
requirement, but it is expected that
candidates will be permanent residents of
the (LS. and that their research will be
carried out in (LS. institutions.

2/Holding other fellowships
concurrently with a Klingenstein award
requires the approval of the Klingenstein
Fund.

3/The candidate should hold
academic rank in a university or medical
school, or the equivalent standing in a
research institute or medical center.

How to Apply

1/Applicants should submit one
original and seven (7) copies of an
application form that is available from
department heads or from the Fund.

2/Three letters of recommendation
from persons familiar with the applicant’s
work are required.

3/More than one application may be
submitted from an institution.

4/Applications and letters of
recommendation must be received by
October 15, 1991.

5/Applications should be mailed to:

More importantly, however, we wish to express our utter dismay at
the notion that bullfighting is even receiving consideration,
Spain assuredly hes cultural identities beyond bullfighting which
could be stressed instead. Particularly if the event’s focus
concerns Columbus' discovery of America and SpanishuLatih
American ties.

The so~celled “sport” of bullfightihg seems superficially to pit
men against beast in an even contest. Unfortunately, this is far
from accurate. We have well authenticated reports that the
following practices are common if not universal in modern
bullfightihg. The hull is severely debilitated prior to its
entrance into the arena, Its eyes are covered with veeeline to

inserted into the hose to obstruct breathing and wet newspaper is
inserted into the ears to distort equilibrium; the bull is hit
with heavy sandbags to weaken him; and the vocal cords are cut to
prevent the sound of painful cries from being heard, Before the
Fight the bull is put in s dark box in a tunnel. When released,
the bull runs toward a light at the end of the tunnel only to
smash into a guillotineulike wall that is dropped at the last
moment. This is all before the fight even begins!

The hull is seldom actually killed during the fight. The lungs
are usually punctured rather than the heart, leaving the bull

FLSA Lawsuit Intervention

The Federal Wildlife Off icers' Association has taken its stand on the FLSA
lawsuit. On July 2nd, the firm of Hunton and Williams, our counsel on this
matter, filed a motion in United States Claims Court which asked that FWOA be
granted leave to intervene in the FISA lawsuit on behalf of the government and
in opposition to the allegations of the plaintiffs.

'lhe formal motion is lengthy, but several key parts of it follow. You should
read them carefully. You will then realize the seriousness of the implications
of the suit on your position if it should prevail.

"The Association moves to intervene in this action on behalf of its membership
to protect the membership ' s interests . As' federal employees currently exempt
from FISA coverage, the Association's members clearly have an interest in any
decision of this court that would change their exempt status and affect the
manner by which their salaries are computed. . .

"'Ihe Association' 5 interests are not adequately protected by the existing
parties to this action. At least two deleterious effects may result from the
plaintiffs' efforts. First, success by the plaintiffs could result in the
government's downgrading of the positions involved. Second, the plaintiffs'
success is likely to result in a reduction of the amount of overtime hours
available to Association members thereby restricting the scheduling flexibility
necessary to carry out their law enforcement duties. ‘Ihe government has no
particular interest in preventing either of these results . Therefore, the
Association's intereSts will not be adequately represented by the government .
The Association requires its own counsel to represent the interests of its

 




"'Ihe third element of the test is also satisfied because the interests of the
Association's members are in danger of impairment. The plaintiffs assert that
the officers are not exempt from FLSA coverage. . .In support of the assertion,
plaintiffs claim that they and all other similarly situated law enforcement
employees exercise no executive, administrative, or professional
responsibilities. In essence, the plaintiffs are arguing that U.S. Fish and
Wildlife officers have no discretionary authority and exercise no independent
judgment. The salary level of such officers is determined by the level of
responsibility and authority they possess . Diminishing their status to help
gain FLSA coverage will have a direct detrimental impact on current salary
levels of the officers and may affect future grade increases as well. . .

"A second endangered interest is the availability of administratively
uncontrolled overtime (AUO) . ADC is overtime that officers may take at their
discretion in order to adequately carry out their law enforcement duties . The
nature of their work necessitates such overtime flexibility. Such ADC is not
compensated at the rate mandated by the FLSA. Imposing the higher overtime
wage rate of the FISA is very likely to result in the reduced availability of
AUO. The officers will therefore suffer financial hardship and will be
restricted in their ability to successfully perform their law enforcement
duties. . .

"Finally, the Association satisfies the fourth element of the test because its
members ' interests are not adequately represented by the original parties to
this proceeding. Clearly, the plaintiffs, whose goals are directly adverse to
those of the Association, will not represent the Association's interests . Nor
can the government be counted upon to safeguard the members' interests.
Although the government will argue against FLSA coverage, its motivations
differ from those of the Association. The government opposes ELSA coverage
because of the potential liability for back pay and for the prospective
increase in costs. It is not necessarily concerned with the detrimental effect
FLSA coverage may have on the wildlife of f icers' grade levels and the future
availability of AUO. 'Ihus , the government may make concessions that protect
its interests at the expense of the Association ' 5 members . Intervention in
these circumstances is certainly appropriate to enable the Association to
represent affected interests that might not otherwise be represented
adequately. "

Now what do you think of the FISA lawsuit??

Fur Dealers Go To Prison

On Monday morning, September 17, 1990, 29-year-old William "Rusty" Wallace,
III, of Houston, Texas, and 36-year-old Billy Jack Ivey, of Fort Smith,
Arkansas, began a four-day trial in Federal District Judge Lucius Bunton's
court in Pecos, Texas. The men faced a total of seven felony counts for
conspiracy and smuggling. Each count carried a maximum penalty of five years
imprisorment and a $250,000 fine.

 




/

(E- A total of 43 witnesses were present to testify that Rusty Wallace, his father,
E William "Bill" Wallace, Jr. , Jack Ivey, and other employees of the D&W Fur
Ccnpany of Hallettsville, 'I‘exas, had set up and operated an elaborate smuggling
{9 pipeline for illegal furs fran Mexico. 'Ihese low-cost, high-value wild animal
pelts were stored in Hallettsville before being shipped to the fur district in
New York City and then on into big money fur markets throughout the world.

Goverment witnesses in the trial included Gonzalo Medina the head of wildlife
1; conservation in the Republic of Mexico, Chester Burdett the director of law
enforcement for Texas Parks and Wildlife, state and federal law enforcement
officers, expert witnesses, and numerous fur smugglers and traffickers from

3“ Mexico and the United States. After a four day trial, the jury deliberated
about three hours before returning a verdict of guilty on all seven felony
counts 2;?

While the Pecos trial was in progress, fur dealers Dwayne Humphreys of
Humphreys Fur Company in Bonita, Louisiana, and Robert Morgan of Booger Hollow
Fur Company in Pineville, Lousiana, waived jury trials and pleaded guilty to
felony charges in Federal District Court in Lafayette, louisiana. A federal
grand jury in Pecos had previously indicted the two men on five felony counts
of conspiracy and transportation of illegal Mexican furs, a violation under the
Lacey Act. The men had lowirgly purchased, received and transported smuggled
Mexican furs from USFWS undercover agents John Keeler and Dan Marshall.
mimphreys and Morgan await sentencing in Lafayette .

”Wallace and Ivey were sentenced on November 26, 1990, by Judge Bunton.
; Sentences for the four counts against Wallace totalled 13 years in prison and

? $15,200 in fines. Ivey was sentenced to eight years in prison and $5,150 in
g fines on three counts. Both men W111 face three years of probation upon their
E release from prison, and are restricted from further involvement in the fur
ktrade.

x

A total of 14 illegal fur traffickers have been arrested on federal violations
since the undercover phase of this investigation ended in December of 1988.
All of the arrests and prosecutions were for counts of conspiracy, smuggling,
and federal wildlife violations under the Lacey Act. These counts have been
felonies, and each count has resulted in a guilty finding.

The combined totals from all sentences and fine assessments for these cases so
far are 48.5 years in prison, $29,350 in fines, and 396 months of supervised
probation following release from prison. Additional federal criminal and civil
charges will likely be filed in at least six states. Arrest warrants for three
fugitives in Mexico are still in effect.
fTexas Parks and Wildlife officers have filed over 85 counts for violations
encountered during this investigation. A substantial number of additional
5" state charges are to be filed.

E This series of state and federal prosecutions came as a result of the largest
undercover investigation conducted so far by USFWS . It came about only after

other enforcement efforts failed to provide a lasting fix to the smuggling
problem. It was clear that fur smuggling would remain as long as there were

L.

illegal fur dealers in the United States who were offering big cash incentives
:1 to smugglers. The first of these early enforcement efforts took place about a
dozen years ago.

On January 24, 1979, Customs and FWS agents seized a tractor-trailer rig
entering illegally into the United States at a remote crossing near Big Bend
National Park in west Texas. Inside the trailer were 17,500 furs which weighed
two and a half tons and were valued at $1.2 million. The big money business in
snuggled Mexican furs was coming of age.

. During the next ten years, numerous illegal fur smuggling msinesses flourished
along the entire border despite increased law enforcement pressures . Unlike
drugs, fur smuggling promised a high profit margin, little risk of getting

” caught, and almost no chance of going to jail.

Mexican law has prohibited the trapping, commercialization and export of that
country's furs since 1952. The penalties associated with this law became an
acceptable risk to the many illegal trappers and fur buyers in Mexico, each of
gWhCIn wanted an ever larger share of the big money offered by U.S. fur buyers.

[The smuggling method is simple. An illegal fur buyer receives a load of
,smuggled furs at the Mexican border, then quickly attaches U.S. pelt tags to
the skins and produces fictitious reports which state that the furs were
legally trapped in the United States. The buyer then challenges any
investigating law enforcement officer to prove that the furs didn ' t originate
in the United States. The officer therefore either has to have a witness to
fgthe smuggling of the furs over the border or has to accept the fur buyer's

“- claim.

1 Conventional law enforcement methods had proven ineffective in stopping the

i smuggling so an undercover approach was initiated. USFWS conducted its first

é. operation in the area around Presidio, Texas, in 1984—85. Seven illegal fur

3, traffickers were charged with violating the Endangered Species Act. All

3’ entered pleas of guilty and were sentenced in federal court in Pecos. Three of

s the men were U. S. fur dealers and four were fur suppliers None received jail
time, and the fines were considered within reason as business expenses.

‘The fur traffickers not caught found these risks to be acceptable. Without

1 competition, they enjoyed very high profits. One dealer was paying $37 for

} each Mexican bobcat pelt, some of which could then be sold for up to $250

, apiece. Such large financial incentives in both countries kept the pipeline of
’3; Mexican fur flowing.

Bobcats are the last remaining spotted cat in the world which can be legally
} harvested for ccmmercial purposes . They are so secretive that accurate counts
3 cannot be made on them in the wild. Bobcats were given special protection
under CITES in 1977 . All states allowing commercial sales of bobcats have been
required to monitor and report annual bobcat harvest levels to FWS. This is to
, prevent excessive commercial harvesting from threatening bobcats with
_ extinction. The biological data from states along the Mexican border became so
i: inflated and inaccirate from smuggled bobcats that were being counted, however,
E that the data lost much of its value .

 

 




3/

In July, 1986, Project Van Horn, a joint state and federal law enforcement
3investigation, was begun. Prosecutions from the investigation continued into
1991. Targets included both suppliers, smugglers and ers along the river
and major fur buyers who id high prices for mgmpelg Undercover contacts
weremade Wlth illegal fickefsm Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Missouri,
Lmisiana, and the fur district in New York City.

Assistant U. S . Attorney Thomas McHugh of San Antonio, Texas, worked closely
with USFWS SA's John Keeler and Dan Marshall throughout the course of this
undercover operation. SA Gordon Ridings of Presidio, Texas, was the Customs
agent assisting in the operation; he also served as the primary contact for
undercover agents .

Essential support was provided by Director Burdett of Texas Parks and Wildlife
and by his officers in west Texas - Raymond Custer, Stanley Brooks, David Cook,
Jerry Hearn, Frank Luna, Robert Newman, Jim Kitchens, Robert French and Ron
McReynolds. New Mexico Game and Fish and Arizona Game and Fish officers played
key roles when undercover purchases and sales took place in those states .

All smuggled Mexican furs bought by the agents were taken to the Van Horn Fur
House, an undercover business front in Van Horn, Texas, for cleaning and
processing. The worked furs were then sold to major United States fur buyers
who were known to deal in smuggled Mexican fur. Each purchase and sale was
carefully documented and evidence was taken for eventual use in federal and
state prosecutions.

The fur species normally found in a load of smuggled fur included bobcat (16%),
gray fox (30%), coyote (24%), ringtail (19%), and other species (10%). The
agents were occasionally offered ocelot and margay skins , but these were
usually refused to prevent these endangered cats from being trapped and killed.

In a little over two seasons, the undercover agents purchased a total of 5,881
furs, which included nearly 1,000 bobcat pelts, for a total cost of $155,000.
The profits netted the undercover fur business allowed the investigation to
‘be self-financing. , The agents conducted as Irmch business as their time and
funds permitted, but were dwarfed by the established illegal dealers. One
iManhattan fur buyer placed an order with the agents for 20,000 Mexican bobcat
:.pe1ts A mexican fur buyer cmnplained that he found more U.S. fur buyers in
EMexico than there were pelts . Another Manhattan fur dealer remarked that he
gwould be getting smuggled bobcat pelts all the way from Guatemala if the trends
‘3 continued.

The present ecological problems faced by wildlife are massive. Additional
pressures brought on by illegal wildlife dealers will certainly cause many
" species to become extinct during our lifetimes. The aggressive prosecution

3 work by AUSA McHugh, the meaningful sentences passed down by Judge Bunton, and

3 the cooperative law enforcement work by so many people and ag _ ies should
provide a stern warning to other illegal wildlife traffickers?

Dear Mr. Song,

In response to your request, we have sent you numerous
publications of the Animal Welfare Institute. we'll be glad to
send 'I‘he..Anigrail.We1.f_are..1_ri§tituteguaricerly to you without

charge so long as you are using it to promote effective animal
welfare work in South Korea.

Let us know about the legal steps you mention as just
beginning in your country. The AWI book, Animalswand_lheirmLegal
Rights, would be useful in giving you background on legislation
so far enacted in the United States. I enclose a leaflet from
our copﬁanion organization, The Society for Animal Protective
Legislation, telling about legislation passed through its efforts
and those of other organizations it enlisted in seeking enactment
of laws to help animals.

.We'll be glad to answer your questions and wish you well
in develOping vigorous animal protection in South Korea.

Sincerely, /z/'

To whom it may concern:

Hi. I am a student from South Korea studying in the US. During
my stay in the US. I developed interest in the animal welfare
movement. While I was visiting my country recently, I have found
out that animal welfare activism is not only underrepresented but
often severely distorted among Korean general public. Now with the
Korean government just beginning to take legal steps against cruelty
to animals, I think this is especially crucial moment to introduce
the correct image of animal welfareactivism to the Korean general
public, to make the government’s initiative successful and to see the
burgeoning of grass-roots movements among the people themselves.
So I decided to do some research on the groups concerned with

animal welfare in the US. I ask for your help!

Do you think my idea is legitimate? Do you have suggestions
about the research? Most of all, how can I have access to the
materials your group put out? Do you have newsletters? Can I
receive them here regularly? Is there a fee for that? There are so
many things I want to know. I will look forward to your reply.

Thank You Very Much
Sincerely,

Dear SAPL,

I received your letter concerning the three topics - lab animals, steel Jaw leghold
trap, and the wild birds. I have fired off my own letters to everyone-yen requested
tn your letter, and I have also included in my newsletter a form letter to our
senators concerning the wild birds. I have found that if you merely tell people to
write, they won’t. 'But, if you research the issue a little, put it all down neatl
for them in a letter, they’ll sign it and mail it off. Oh well, whatever works! w~
.have about 50 people on my mailing list, and I’m hoping that they all sign the
letters and mail them.

I apologize for not being able to send monetary help in all of these projects. Our
group is extremely broke at the moment...but we can try to help in any other way
possible, such as letter writing. Thanks for keeping me on your list and please be
assured that I’m getting those letters out!!!

I appreciate_your time - keep up the great worki!

MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: June 1991

We note that the Society for Animal Protective
Legislation has taken the vigorous new action in defense of laboratory
animals, animals trapped for their fur, and wild birds captured and
shipped from their native land to enrich the pet industry dealers.

As you know, regulations under the Improved Standards for Laboratory

Animals amendments to the ANIMAL WELFARE ACT failed to set enforceable
standards for exercise for laboratory dogs and psycholgical well-being of non-
human primates. This should have been a problem for Congress to resolve, and
the American people should count on Congress to protect all living creatures
from abuse ... and not depend on others to do the job for them.

The lawsuit names he UO 8. Department of Agriculture, the U. S. Department
of Health and Human Services, and the Office of Management and Budget as
responsible for the failure on eleven different counts. The plaintiffs
request relief from the court, asking that the Department of Agriculture
change the regulations to conform with the eXpressed will of Congress.

The case has been referred to Judge Charles Richey of the U. S. District
Court for the District of Columbia.

It appears to the animal welfare community, ever growing in this country
by PUBLIC DEMAND for proper and humane care of its animals, that the above
defendants speak for the rich vivisection industry as vs th4 humane community.
This is intolerable.
((PS: We approve of the
Sincerely and humanely, action by the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation, above-

ﬂéw éé ] mentioned) ) .

MEMBERS OF CCNTRESS: June 1991

A bill to ban importation of exotic wild-caught birds for the pet
trade has been introduced by Congressmen BEILENSON, STUDDS

and Senator Max Baucus and John Chafee. The ban would take
effect upon enactment of the WILD BIRD PROTECTION ACT,

H. R.Z 2540 in the House of Representatives and S 1219 in the
Senate.

The legislators also introduced legislation. endorsed by the
industry. This bill, entitled the Exotic Wild Bird Conservation
Act, is based on a five-year long phaseout, and its demands for
increased personnel and funding in both the Department of the
Interior and the Department of Agriculture make enactment within
the foreseeable future UNLIKELY.

We clearly express our support for the WILD BIRD PROTECTION ACT

in preference to any other legislation on the subject. There is

a great urgency of protecting many species of beautiful birds from
cruelty and death and from extinction in the wild.

Recent undercover work by the Environmental Investigation Agency
in both Argentina ans Senegal (two of the few countries which
still allow eXportation of their native birds) has revealed
repellent cruelty and loss of live in capture and shipping out

of the birds, many of them unfledged babies.

Perhaps other Senators and Congresspersons would want to
Co-Sponsor this humane legislation. Wild birds should fly free.

We know that there are people who make money from the misery
of animals. and the big dealers who make the huge mark-ups

to garner big profits - even if many of the birds they import
die on the way - will undoubtedly lobby hard against this
bill.

For ethical and moral reasons, as well as humanitarian reasons,
we urge your support for S 1219 and H. R. 2540.

MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS
United States of America: June 1991

SENATOR DANIEL K. AKAKA of Hawaii has introduced 8 l259

- the Steeljaw Leghold Trap Prohibition Act. We ask our
Senators and Congresspersons to join Senator Akaka in
support of this legislation; perhaps Co-Sponsor this Bill.

There is a companion bill in the House, H. R. 1354.
Over 80 Representatives have joined Congressman James
Scheuer of New York in Co-Sponsoring the bill. Now is
a golden opportunity for other humane Congresspersons
to join in support of H. R. 1354.

The steeljaw trap has been banned in over 50 countries
in the world; why not here.

On June 14 all European Community countries except France made the
political decision to support the Regulations banning

importation of certain furs from countries that have not

prohibited the steeljaw leghold trap. A final vote is

expected this Fall. FUR is not fashionable anymore!

Even ranch-raised animals for fur is not humane or

tolerable in today's civilized society. During the

animals entire life in a small cage, unable to act out any
of his basic natural instincts in a barren, artificial
environment. Then he will be KILLED by primitive
ELECTROCUTION (devices put onto his mouth, and into his
anus) and his skin will be scraped off of his back to make a
"luxury" fur garment. These animals are among millions of
animals who are prisoners of human vanity.

FUR COATS, once symbols of glamour, are now recognized as
the end result of misery, suffering, and death for millions
of animals. Please help these prisoners of cruelty by man.

Humanely and sincerely,

Dear Ms. Stevens:

I am vmmking (n1 a project concerning the legal status of
animals, specifically laboratory animals, if} conjunction with
Dr. Malcolm Skolnick of the Neurophysiology Research Center of the
University of Texas Health Science Center. The research is sponm
sored by the institute for Higher Education Law and Governance of
the University of Houston Law Center. We plan to publish a mono~
graph in late 1991 or early 1992, in which we hope to lay out the
issues and encourage dialogue among the parties. We will present
as balanced a view of the issues as we can. I am writing you in
this connection to ask about your position on the use of animals
in laboratory research.

Specifically, I am interested in the following:

Dear Friends:

Earlier this year, I contacted you regarding Assembly Bill 1900, my
legislation which greatly increases criminal penalties for horse
thieves and provides for a paper trail so that stolen horses can be
better tracked. I thought you would appreciate an update on this
important measure.

You will be pleased to know that Assembly Bill 1900 not only passed
the Assembly Committee on Agriculture, but in addition, it also
passed unanimously on the Assembly Floor. As mentioned before,
legislation of this type has been defeated in the past, however, this
bill has not yet received any opposition.

Assembly Bill 1900 now awaits action in the State Senate, and I
anticipate it will be considered in the coming weeks. While I am
hopeful that Assembly Bill 1900 will receive the necessary votes for
passage, I would encourage you to contact your State Senator and let
him or her know of this bill's importance to horse owners across our
state. We have received hundreds of support letters for this bill
from horse organizations and owners throughout California.

Finally, I have enclosed a copy of the analysis for Assembly Bill
1900 which was prepared by the Assembly Agriculture Committee. I
hope you find this information helpful.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this important
legislation, please do not hesitate to call my office. With your
help I know we can make a difference.

Sincerel

AB 1900
Date of Hearing: April 29, 1991
ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE

Rusty Areias, Chair

AB 1900 (O'Connell) - As Amended In Committee

SUBJECT

This bill deals with horses, mules, and burros destined for slaughter.

DIGEST

ﬁgisting law requires bills of sale and certificates of consignment for
horses, mules, and burros.

 

This bill instead prohibits any person from purchasing, consigning, selling,
or accepting the donation of a horse, mule, or burro destined for slaughter
unless a written bill of sale or another written instrument with specified
information is provided.

This bill empowers the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA)
investigators with peace officer status and, if qualified, with humane officer
status.

 

This bill requires auction yard operators or dealers who handle these animals
destined for slaughter to maintain written records of all sales for two years
which are subject to review on demand.

 

This bill requires all horses, mules, and burros destined for slaughter to be
first inspected by CDFA and the shipper to provide valid proof of sale.
Persons violating this provision are subject to a civil penalty of not less
than $50/violation and are entitled to an administrative hearing.

 

This bill requires CDFA to iSSue a inspection certificate, with specified
information, if the shipper is in lawful possession of the animal. The
shipper is required to possess the certificate while in transit and failure to
do so means a civil penalty of not less than $50/violation.

 

This bill mandates a $5/animal inspection fee paid at the point of inspection.
The fees are deposited in the Food and Agriculture Fund.

 

This bill requires CDFA to prepare and maintain memoranda of the inspections
for two years and the inspection certificates for 5 years.

 

Existing law requires any person selling horses, mules, and burros or their
hides on consignment to keep a certificate of consignment, as specified, for
at least one year.

 

- continued —

 




5.3.1.299.

This bill recasts this provision. ‘M

This bill makes a person, in addition to criminal penalties, civilly liable

for four times the animal's value plus the prime rate interest and an amount
of fair compensation for the owner's expenses, including attorney fees, for:

 

(1) Wrongful taking or transporting animals for slaughter without the
owner's consent; and

(2) Defrauding that results in wrongful taking or transporting.

This bill has a crimes and infractions disclaimer.

 

FISCAL EFFECT

Unknown, but potentially significant revenue to the Ag Fund.

COMMENTS

An effective identification and tracking system is needed to deter horse
'theft, which has become a widespread crime.

SUPPORT OPPOSITION

To Whom It May Concern:

We are interested in the possibility of distributing
your brochures, or information concerning your organization,
in a gift basket business opening this fall. If this is
acceptable to you would there be a cost to our company to
receive these and would it be possible to receive two brochures
at your earliest convenience so we can read through them.

We would be interested in, anywhere from 125 to 500 of
these brochures, to distribute as early as October.

If this is feasible to you please direct all
correspondence to the address at the bottom of this request.

We thank you in advance for your speedy reply and your

help concerning this matter.

tramways, etc.).

De plus, et cela naturelle-
ment, l’assurance-maladie verse
les indemnités journalieres, les
pensions d’invalidité, les presta-
tions familiales, les retraites et
participe, ce qui est ignore, a
l’action sanitaire et sociale, qui
englobe tous les credits d’équi-
pement des h6pitaux et cliniques
(cela étant tres important).

Alors, je dis qu'il faut compa-
rer des choses comparables et
que le terme de charges socia-
les « les plus lourdes d’Europe »
selon vous ne recouvre pas les
mémes choses.

Je ne prendrai que quelques
exemples :

C Le remboursement, chez
nous, dites-vous, n’est que de
71 "/0. C’est ignorer que les ma-
ladies graves (dites de Iongue
duree) sont remboursees a
100%. C’est ignorer aussi que
tout acte operatoire supérieur a
K 50 (cela commence a l’appen-
dicite !) est remboursé a 100 %
(deux exemples seulement).

0 La Sécurité sociale, en
France, comprend l’assurance-
vieiilesse (en gros, la retraite).
Savez-vous que, pour une
femme (par exemple) de 60 ans,
il suffit d’avoir cotisé dans sa vie
un trimestre pour avoir droit a
une retraite (naturellement
négligeable) et surtout a tout ce
qui s'y rattache essentieliement:
le droit au remboursement de
tous ses frais médicaux jusqu’a
la fin de ses jours, sans aucune
cotisation supplémentaire autre
que ses trois mois du départ?
Laquelle de vos 577 caisses
d’assurance-maladie en Suisse
en ferait autant ? J'ajoute que, si
cette femme (puisque j'ai pris
une femme comme exemple) a
eu par exemple 4 enfants élevés
dans des conditions normales,
elle bénéficiera avec, je le
répéte, au minimum un seul tri-
mestre d’assurance personnelle.
de deux ans d’ancienneté par
enfant: ce qui fait 32 trimes-
tres + 1 = 33 trimestres d'equi-
valent de cotisations sur les-
quels seront calculés ses points
de retraite -ce qui ne devient
plus négligeable.

7O

Je voudrais savoir si un or-
ganisme privé, méme en Suisse,
en fait autant ?

Je passe, car ce serait trop
long (mais fort important,
croyez-moi) sur les droits « ac-
cessoires »: reversion, aide-
ménagére, aide au logement,
reduction d’impét tierce per-
sonne, redevance television, as-
surance-auto, aide aux vacan-
ces, etc.).

Conclusion: il est tres facile
de dauber sur la « Sécu »;
moins facile de trouver mieux. I

El Cher monsieur,

Je vous écris a propos de
I‘article du Figaro-Magazine sur
Ie massacre des dauphins aux

J’ai vingt-huit ans, j’adore les
animaux, la nature et la vie. J'ai
pleuré en lisant cet article qui
m’a laissée choquée et extréme-
ment déprimée.

C'est une telle cruauté, un tel
manque de respect pas seule-
ment envers la nature et ces
pauvres dauphins, mais aussi
envers ces enfants qui sont obli-
gés de se baigner dans le sang.

C'est révoltant de voir Ia froi-
deur et l'insensibilité de ces
hommes qui s’amusent a tuer
pour rien, a voir du sang inoffen-
sif et désespéré couler; et qui
menent ces entants sur le che-
min honteux d'une vision de vie
pourrie, sans amour, sans pitié
et sans aucun respect. Moi,
autant que toute ma famille. et
tous mes amis que j'ai pu mettre
au courant de ce massacre,- don-

CURITIBA— A Sooiedade de

(SPVS) vai solicitar a0 grupo
internacional Trafic, que fis—
caliza denuncias de traﬁco de

animais silvestres uma visita .

de inspecao a fronteira entre

Segundo a SPVS, centenas de

veados e outros animais possi-
velmente ameaoados de extin—
oéo sﬁo vendidos nas ruas de
Ciudad del Leste, no Paraguai,
e trazidos ilegalmente a0 Bra-
sil. O presidente da SPVS, Clo~

oao “muito delicada porque

vadir um pens vizinho para
proibir a venda de animais s11-

do, que uma organizaoao inter-

Assistant Director for Fish and Wildlife Enhancement
U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service

Interior Building, Room 3024

Washington, D. C.

Dear Ralph:

I am very much concerned about the "Future of CITES Workshop"
organized by Rowan Martin. I note that Kenya is to be
represented by Ian Parker, a notorious apologist for the,
ivory trade.

Although I did not have an opportunity to attend Dr. Leakey's

speech at the National Press Club, a recent report
summarizing his statements shows that his position, based on
a careful analysis of the actual economic realities, is
firmly opposed to any reopening of the trade by split
listing. The report, from the International Tusk Force,
states:

DR. LEAKEY'S STATEMENT ON KENYA WILDLIFE POLICY

Last month, Richard Leakey addressed the
National Press Club in Washington, D. C., and outlined
his policy on the ivory trade. It was gratifying to
hear that the price of ivory paid to the poacher has
fallen from $30 per kilo to $3 and that the incidence
of poaching has declined dramatically. This is largely
due to the action taken by CITES in 1989, the resulting
ban, and the pressures of world public opinion.
However, at the next CITES meeting in Japan in March,
1992, there will be proposals from the Southern African
countries (Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa) to
downlist their populations from Appendix I (endangered)
to Appendix II (threatened) and reopen the trade on
a limited basis. Leakey feels that this action would:
ignore the very slow recovery period necessary; ignore
the inability of Southern African countries to prevent
illegal shipments of ivory; indicate to the world that
elephant populations had miraculously recovered; and

 

 




Dr. Ralph Morganweck -2- July 22,

stimulate global demand and rising prices. The
elephants' future will only be secure if the ban is
kept in place, and if the demand for ivory and its
value remain low.

'. . . it is essential to disassociate elephant
management from ivory management; while Kenya would
agree that the management of elephants is a sovereign
issue, the management of ivory is a matter that
affects the whole of Africa. The issue is not whether
a country should or should not cull its elephants, but
what it should or should not do with the ivory that
results from the cull.

'. . . the argument most often used by the
pro-ivory trade States is that they have too many
elephants and that a sustainable offtake of ivory
provides badly needed revenues that can be channeled
back into conservation programmes . . . However, what
they fail to point out is that l) the ivory trade ban
does not prevent Zimbabwe from culling or hunting
elephants and distributing the meat or the fees to
the local communities, and 2) that the profits from
ivory were not channeled into the wildlife department
but rather went directly to the Government's Central
Treasury. The application of these funds by the
government as additional resources to conservation
programmes has not been demonstrated.

'South Africa, too, has argued that they must
control the numbers of elephants in Kruger and other
National Parks . . . By adding an additional $1 to
the [entrance] fee, they would make more money than
from the sale of ivory . . .

 

'When analysed closely, the Southern African
argument for trading in ivory just does not make sense,
particularly when juxtaposed with the financial costs
that the illegal ivory trade imposes on poorer countries
in terms of stepping up anti-poaching operations . . .

 

'When the_cost of effective anti-poaching is
juxtaposed with the relatively meager profits that
could be made by Southern African nations from a
sustainable offtake of ivory, the argument for
encouraging the trade becomes absurd. If we assume
a sustainable offtake of 3 percent of the populations
per year, the 1986 ivory price of $80 per kg at an
average weight of 10 kg per elephant, South Africa
would make some $200,000 per year, Zimbabwe $1.3
million, and Botswana some $1.6 million. .These

 

 




Dr. Ralph Morganweck -3- July 22, 1991

profits are insignificant relative to
effective anti-poaching campaigns which would be
incurred across Africa as a direct result of existence
of the ivory trade . . . Clearly the economics of

the ivory trade just do not make sense for Africa.’

Dear Christine: I think Annette should
have taken a tip from Tom Bradley in L.A.
and supported a low—cost clinic. It most
certainly would have bolstered her pOpu-

larity.

Her 72% of the total vote in 1989 was not
the landslide it might appear. She had a
huge war—chest resulting from return favors
for her years of fund—raising which scared
off any competition. It was one of the
lowest turn—outs for mayor we have ever had.

éf‘transitional mayor” whose mission is to
Espan the years between the ruling oli-

“As mayor, Annette Strauss. inherited
a decade of neglect, including crime, the
police, race relations, neighborhoods
and deterioration of basic city services,”
- Buerger says. “To her credit, she
brought these issues into the public
View.”
Others, however, including black and
«Hispanic community leaders and an in-
creasing number of white business lead-
ers say her tenure will best be remem-

bered as an ill-advised experiment in

big-city politics.

“I was very glad when she got elect-
ed,” Galindo said. “I said, ‘We ﬁnally
broke, the white, male dominance in city
politicians.’ We said, ‘If a white female
can break in, then the next time it will
be a black or a brown.’ With the conser-
vative element, at least you can deal
with them. But she will smile at you
and then stab you in the back.”

' Her “biggest challenge

Feelings of betrayal spring largely
from what friends and foes agree has
been Strauss" most difﬁcult challenge
and greatest failure: council redistrict-
ing.
In 1988, two unsuccessful black coun-

cil candidates ﬁled a- federal Voting
Rights Act suit against the city, alleging
. that the system of electing eight council
members from districts and three, in-
cluding the mayor, citywide, discrimi-
nates against minorities.

Strauss chose to all but ignore the suit
and the plaintiffs’ arguments when she
appointed the Citizens Charter Review
Committee that crafted the 10-4-1 plan
voters approved in August 1989.

In March, US. District Judge Jerry ‘

Buchmeyer agreed With the plaintiffs,
ruling that 8-3 diluted the: voting
strength of blacks‘and Hispanics. He al-
so indicated that 10-4—1 — 10 council
members elected from districts, four
from quadrants and the mayor citywide
— was not an acceptable remedy.

At each stage —-'court rulings, charter
elections and council votes —-— Strauss
has appeared to drift with prevailing po-
litical winds. .

In August 1989, she worked for pas-
sage of 10-4-1; when the US. Justice
Department declined to review the plan,
she cast the tie-breaking vote in April
1990 to submit an interim 12-1 plan; in
December, she endorsed 14-1; and,
when Dallas voters rejected that, she
completed the loop by casting another
key council vote to defend 10—4-1. '

“Flip-ﬂop Annie,” Galindo calls the
mayor, advising: “Don’t be the ﬁrst one
to talk to Annette; be the last one. You
may go in there with the best of argu-
ments, but the last one to talk to her is

the one who will convince her. This is
where leadership. comes in.”

Even Palmer admits being “perplexed
and concerned” about Strauss’ leader-

ship on redistricting: “This may well

While Strauss is \jquick to proclaim
that “nobody on the 14-1 campaign
worked harder thaniil 2 did,” her weekly

schedules reveal thatin the month of
campaigning for there, ec. 8 referendum,
she was out of the C'5}_for 14 of 31 days.

Five days after her return, she ﬂew to

days for a J .C. Penney-sponsored World
Cultural Conference .

“I went because I had the opportunity
to make a lot of busmess centacts that I
would not have had the opportunity to

Three days later, On Dec. 1, a week
before the election, She left for 2 1/2 days
in Washington, DC. '

“It was - my ﬁnal meeting there in my
role as trustee at the Kennedy Center,”
she says, adding that She also worked on
arrangements for a Texas Arts Festival

. to be held there in June. “Even on that
trip I was working on the possibility of
raising money for the [14-1] campaign.”

ﬂights at DFW, that they would move a
substantial number of ﬂights to Love

her overriding desire to protect DFW

In the wake of the defeat of 14-1, the
city awaits ”yet another ruling from
Buchmeyer, this time on a request by
the plaintiffs for May elections under an
all single—member district plan. Mean-
while, an increasingly frustrated busi-
ness community has set its sights on
finding a successor to Strauss, even
though she has not ruled out a bid for a
third term. 4

“I really do not think they are think-
ing about Annette Strauss today,” says
former Mayor Jack Evans, who is posi-
tioning himself for the next. mayoral
race. “I think what they are thinking
about is who’s the next mayor. I don’t
want to put her in a lame duck position,

- but they are looking at what Buchmeyer

comes up with and how we take this
city and go forward.”

Even if Strauss decides to seek a third
term, sources with access to private po-
litical polls say her perceived inability to
lead has taken a gradual but substantial
toll on, her popularity. ‘

In contrast to high. ratings in 1987,
when the vast majority of those sur-
veyed labeled her performance “good”
or “excellent,” more recent ﬁgures sug-
gest that roughly half the voters would

: now rate her performance as “fair” or

“poor,” the sources said.

dWhile Evans believes Strauss is
blamed unfairly for problems created by
other council members, he concedes
that she has had serious problems build-
ing a consensus ,on redistricting. “I'
wouldn’t say it’s her fault . . . but when
you can’t " get more than four votes,
we’ve got a problem.”

DE LA GARZA REELECTED COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN
BY DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS

For immediate release, Wednesday, December 5, 1990 (PR90-104)

WASHINGTON -- Rep. E (Kika) de la Garza, D-Texas, was reelected
Wednesday by the House Democratic Caucus to his sixth term as Chairman of the
Committee on Agriculture.

"I am very grateful to the members of the Democratic Caucus for their
continued and overwhelming support of my chairmanship of the Committee on
Agriculture. It has been a great honor and a tremendous challenge to serve as
Committee chairman these past 10 years. I look forward to working with the
members of the Committee on Agriculture as we tackle the issues confronting
American agriculture and our nation’s food and farm trade policies during the 102nd
Congress," Rep. de la Garza said.

The Democratic Caucus decision on all Committee chairmanships will be put
to the full House for ratiﬁcation when Congress reconvenes January 3, 1991.

Rep. de la Garza has served continuously on the House Agriculture Committee
since ﬁrst entering Congress in 1965. He was elected a subcommittee chairman in
1967 and became the Committee’s chairman in January 1981.

During his tenure as chairman, Rep. de la Garza has guided the development
and successful passage of three omnibus farm bills (1981, 1985 and the recently-
enacted Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990). These measures,
particularly the 1985 and 1990 farm bills, have been hailed for their increased
environmental emphasis which has led to new programs to protect the nation’s
valuable soil and water resources, including wetlands. Rep. de la Garza has also
placed*a high priority on encouraging diversiﬁed economic development in rural
America.

In addition, Rep. de la Garza has led the Committee in crafting various
measures to control Federal agriculture spending that were included in the budget
reconciliation acts of the 1980’s and the new ﬁve-year reconciliation act.

Other landmark agricultural legislation signed into law since Rep. de la Garza
became Committee chairman include: substantial reforms in the nation’s major
pesticide law (the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act), the 1987
Agricultural Credit Act, and the 1988 and 1989 Disaster Assistance Acts.

A wild time at the zoo

. The buzz word in the best zoos is “behavioural enrichment”: ways of making a captive
environment as much like the wild as possible

Cage with a view: Cheetahs at Glasgow Z00 appreciate a platform from which they can watch the world from a distance

EARS, like most wild animals, spend most of their
waking hours looking for food. Much of the time that is
left, they spend making nests. Sleep takes up a lot of
each 24 hours, and hibernation can occupy much of the
winter. That leaves a bit of time for seeking mates and seeing
off rivals, and for the females, quite a lot more for child
rearing. It may not sound much, but it keeps them busy.
Bears in zoos—in the bad old days—spent most of the day-
light hours begging. When they were not doing that they often
took to pacing up and down. The polar bears seemed particu-
larly addicted to this. They did not make nests, for the nests
were made for them—though polar bears were presumed to
prefer cold concrete to remind them of Arctic ice. They mated
if the curator provided a compatible mate; a matter that was
in his hands, and was decided largely on economic grounds.
There is, however, a new tradition in zoos. Most of the
serious institutes now recognise that they have an important
role .to play in conservation by breeding animals in captivity.
The descendants of the captive animals might well return to
the wild, and to be fit to do so, their behaviour as well as their
genes must be conserved. Zoos, too, acknowledge (as some of
them did not seem to in the past) that animals are sentient
beings, capable of being unhappy; that they are not simple

machines, with reﬂexes routinely triggered by standardised
stimulations. For their personal welfare, as well as their
conservational value, captive animals should be kept in ways
that respect their psychology. ,

Nothing smaller than a national park could truly simulate the
wild, but in zoos that must be smaller than that—even the ones
where the animals each have several hectares—the buzz word
now is “behavioural enrichment”; and the aim is to create an
environment and a way of life that is at least an abstract of
the wild. Among the pioneers in Britain are the Monkey
Sanctuary in Looe, Cornwall, described in New Scientist in
April (“More room for the woollies”, 21 April 1990); in
Glasgow, where Graham Law is keeper of carnivores; and
London, where David Shepherdson has been employed for
three years specifically to enhance the lives of the residents.

We can trace the origins of behavioural enrichment back in
several directions. At the turn of this century Carl Hagenbeck
created Hamburg Zoo, with artfully designed landscapes that
give the visitors the illusion of wilderness, and perhaps fool
some of the animals some of the time. The American
primatologist Robert Yerkes, interested primarily in the
laboratory study of apes, wrote in 1925 that: “The greatest
possibility for improvement in our provision for captive

primates lies in the invention and installation of apparatus
which can be used for work and play.” Note the friendly,
“human” concepts of “work and play”. This was written
‘ before Ivan Pavlov had done his seminal experiments on
reﬂexes in dogs, and given rise to the mechanistic view of
animals that prevailed for the following five decades.

But many feel. that the true pioneer of behavioural enrich-
ment is Hal Markowitz, who
in the 1970s set Out to im-
prove the environments in
Portland Zoo, Oregon. In
those days these were “tradi-
tional”, which meant ex—
tremely barren. Markowitz
began with the lar (white-
handed) gibbons, a mother
with her infant and two juve—
niles, who lived in a concrete
box with bars, and were fed
through a chute at ﬂoor level.
Markowitz did not have the
option of planting a forest for
them, so he set out to devise
games to bring out their wild
behaviour. For starters, he and
his colleagues created a ma-
chine that coughed up food
on one side of the cage (near
the, top, for'gibbons like to
feed high up) when a lever
was pulled on the other side,
in response to a light.

By modern standards this
has an ancient behaviourist
laboratory feel to it, but it did
allow the gibbons to exhibit a
truly wondrous ingenuity and variety of behaviour. The oldest
youngster, for example, nicknamed Harvey Wallbanger
(because he banged the wall, why else?), was happy to work
the machine so that his mother could pick up the titbit, but
delighted in denying and teasing his sister.

From this beginning Markowitz and his followers devised
a whole range of hardware and techniques, designed always
to increase the complexity of the environment and its
unpredictability: two elements that typify the wild and are

singularly lacking in captivity. Monkeys learnt to work for
poker chips, which they then cashed for food; and showed,
along the way, a wonderful line in deception and sleight of
hand. Servals leapt at ﬂying targets, just as they leap for birds
in the wild. Pumas chased the equivalents of the electric hares
employed in greyhound racing. All animals showed they could
outsmart the machines—even ostriches, traditional symbols of

knuckleheadedness. All, more to the point, showed that they
preferred to “work” for at least some of their food even if they
were given all they needed on a plate. All, as Markowitz puts
it, liked to exercise “control” over their environment, and were
“proud” of their achievements.

Shepherdson came to London from the University of
Sussex in 1987 with a PhD in badger behaviour, and was keen
to emulate the work of Markowitz. By that time, though,
Markowitz had come under quite a bit of fire—albeit largely
unfairly—because people felt that the behaviour he was tend-
ing to stimulate could be just as abnormal as the behaviour he
was seeking to replace. Incessant pacing and other stereotyped
behaviour (“stereotypy”) seems bad, but animals hooked on
games like children on fruit machines were hardly an
improvement. In the wild, fOr example, carnivores are
singularly idle; but a puma in one 200 was seen to “hunt” his
electric prairie dog 200 times in a day. This was “natural”
behaviour perhaps, but there was far too much of it.

There arose in the 19805 a different and “softer” approach.
Armand Chamove and his colleagues, then at the University
of Stirling, showed that primates benefited enormously from
nothing more than a ﬂoor covering of woodchips. Each chip
was a potential toy; and the animals spent hours looking for
food tucked among them, just as they would forage in the wild
among leaves and leaf litter. Such an innovation is more
radical than it seems, for the concrete ﬂoors and ceramic walls
of previous decades had not been introduced to give the
animals a bad time, but for hygiene. The woodchips repre-
sented a shift in philosophy, reﬂecting growing veterinary
confidence in the control of disease, and greater reliance on
the natural behaviour of animals in keeping themselves clean.

Shepherdson’s approach can be seen to owe much both to
Markowitz and to Chamove—while the individual ideas, he

Bed for bears: in the wild, bears make nests for the night. At Glasgow Zoo they construct something similar with straw

stresses, usually come from keepers, who know the animals
best. Simplicity is his watchword: creating devices that others
can copy for irreducible expense. Markowitz had also been
keen to ensure that his machines were cheap, for even the
richest zoos have many pressures on funds, so his early
gibbon lever-pressing game was built largely from bits of an
ancient coffee grinder.

But some of Markowitz’s followers were less thrifty.
Antwerp Zoo, for example, had a locust dispenser built like a
Gatling gun that fired live insects in among the fennec foxes.
Great fun for the foxes (if not for the locusts) but as
Shepherdson points out: “Each locust had to be loaded
individually into its chamber—which took an enormous
amount of the keeper’s time.”

Shepherdson has built a variation on the theme that consists
merely of a tube with holes in the sides. The tube is stuffed
with newspaper, with crickets lurking among the folds, and is
tied to the roof of some cricket-lover’s den. Every so often,
one of the insects falls through one of the holes. Thus the
animals find a sizable supply of crickets at irregular intervals,
just as‘they would do in the wild; and thus (they quickly learn)
it pays them to forage, as they would do in the wild. The
meerkats at London have such a tube stuffed with sawdust,
from which mealworms fall from time to time.

Primates, of course, with their lively minds, have always
been favourite targets for behavioural enrichment. They have
also been studied in the wild more than most mammals, so
there is plenty of wild behaviour to act as a model. One of Jane
Goodall’s early observations during her studies in Tanzania (in
what is now the Gombe National Park) was that chimpanzees
“fish” for termites, by poking twigs into the insects’ nests.
They also modify the twigs by tearing the leaves off—the first

evidence that non-human animals may not only be tool-users,
but tool-makers as well. Every zoo that has chimps now seems
to have an artificial termite mound, where the animals fish for
honey or what you will.

London also has a simplified variation: a plastic drainpipe
fixed on the outside of the enclosure. The pipe has holes in
the sides, and inside there are pieces of fruit. The chimps push
the fruit along by poking twigs through the holes, until the
pieces fall Ont of the end and can be grabbed. Gorillas and
orang—utans have not been observed to probe for termites in
the wild, but they too enjoy the termite-fishing game. Orangs,
indeed, take to it better than chimps because in general they
are less excitable, and concentrate better.

Nuclear families fail

For any social animal, the best behavioural enrichment is the
presence of their fellows—provided, of course, that the group
has the kind of structure that it would have in the wild.
Cornwall’s Monkey Sanctuary succeeded in breeding woolly
monkeys in the early 19603 when most other zoos were failing
miserably, largely because its founder, Leonard Williams,
recognised that wild woollies live in troops with one dominant
male and several subordinates, plus females, juveniles and
infants. Keep them in pairs, as zoos commonly did, and the
male simply bullied the female unmercifully, and sometimes,
literally, to death.

Gibbons, though, have an unusual social life. They live in
monogamous pairs (which is not particularly unusual) but they
also “sing” loud and long, to tell other pairs in neighbouring
territories that they are indeed in residence and that the neigh-
bours can forget any territorial ambitions they may have.
London has one pair of lar gibbons, which is the correct

grouping, but these were de-
nied the natural choruses of
neighbours. So Shepherdson
rigged up 3 30-watt loud-
speaker 50 metres away from
the gibbon enclosure, 10
metres from the ground, and
blasted a recording of wild
gibbons twice a day, at 11 in
the morning and 4 in the
afternoon. This was on an
endless 60-second cassette
which, he says, “contained
several sequences of alternat-
ing male and female calls of
increasing intensity climaxing
in a long screeching call from
the female, the great call, and
a warbling reply from the
male”. Just like the wild.

London’s gibbons undoubt- '
edly responded to this,
climbing to the top of their
enclosure and swinging across
it by their arms, and they
did not grow bored with the
recording. After several
months, they , were still
responding. Of course, such
stimulation could in principle
be negative; it could simply
frighten the resident pair.
But observation in the wild
suggests that the neighbours’
calls strengthen pair-bonding,
and the response of London’s
gibbons certainly did not
seem negative.

Carnivores are a special challenge because in the wild they
hunt, and very few zoos care to offer live prey. Among carni-
vores, bears are commonly regarded as the biggest challenge
because they are in general more active than cats, less social
than dogs and particularly prone to stereotypy. Doubts have
been raised whether polar bears in particular should be kept
at all. But it’s the carnivores that are the special interest of
Graham Law at Glasgow. The first of his innovations (one
emphasised also at nearby Edinburgh) was to give the animals
a good View. The value of this first dawned at Glasgow when
the cheetahs showed slightly bizarre behaviour when fed. The
keepers threw their meat over the fence of their enclosure, and
the animals would leap to catch it. But if the cheetahs missed,
and the meat fell to the ground, they would return plaintively
to the fence, perhaps tripping over their dinner as they came.
But then, says Law, in the wild they are daytime hunters who
catch their prey with a long sprint. They do not have an out—
standing sense of smell, and neither do they look at things that
are under their noses. But they do have excellent long vision
and they like looking at the world from afar.

So GlangW built a large platform, from which the cheetahs
have a clear View over the elephant house, onto the motorway
beyond. In the wild, cheetahs climb to the top of termite
mounds, to look around and to defecate. Glasgow’s cheetahs
now spend much of their time on the lookout The tigers, too,
were given a large platform; and they look over the river to
the riding school beyond. Theoretically, such a View could be
frustrating. But the animals seem content to watch. Edinburgh
has also modified many of its cat enclosures to give the
residents a distant View from the 200’s natural hills.

Changes in feeding regime have been Glasgow’s second

Lookout: the Himalayan bears at Glasgow Zoo can climb on ramps linking platforms to enjoy the
view or to search for food hidden by the keepers

major innovation for the cats. Meat for the leopards and
smaller cats is hung from the ceiling on the end of pickaxe
handles and in a different spot each day; the animals have to
be 1ngenious to get at it. A favourite trick for awkward spots
is to leap from the ground to set the pole a- swing, and then
climb onto a branch to catch the meal at the end of its swing.
Sometimes, Law admits, he has tested the animals too much.
For the ocelots he introduced hanging poles which they had
to climb to reach the meat at the top. To make it difficult,
the pole was attached to the wire roof by a swivel. But
the climbing cats then “whirled round and round at 100 miles

an hour, and the more they tried to save themselves the faster

they went”. When the dazed animals finally picked them-
selves up from the ﬂoor the keepers changed the arrangement
to a simple swing.

But the bears at Glasgow—polar bears and Himalayan
bears—have experienced the most radical changes. The polar
bear enclosure was inherited from the 1960s, when it was
considered rather good. an acre (0 4 hectares) of space, with
concrete hills and a large pool, initially intended for six
animals. Big it was, by the standards of the day, but it was still
fundamentally a bear “pit”: a large hole in the ground.

Pits for keeping polar bears have advantages: they are
secure, as bear enclosures need to be, and they are cheap.
Disadvantages for keepers and animals alike include the
problems of cleanliness. Litter blows into pits. More to the
point, the bears themselves are reluctant to move from the
enclosure at large into their dens, because they do not like
being locked up; and if they cannot be locked up, the keepers
cannot get in to clean the enclosures. If there is more than one
bear, they cannot be lured into their dens even by putting their

 




 

 

food inside, because they go in to get it one at a time and then
bring it out again. One solution has been to reduce the
potential mess by feeding meat as small fillets, so that at least
there are no smelly bones left lying around. The result is a
meal that the animals can bolt down in five minutes ﬂat.

With a concrete environment, no View, and perfunctory
meals it seems no wonder that polar bears have been among
the most notorious stereotypers; and Glasgow’s bears were
stereotyping too, when Law took over.

The first innovation was to feed in the morning instead of
the evening, so that the bears at least spent the morning in
post-prandial comfort, instead of growing hunger. This brought
immediate improvement: more sunbathing and swimming, and
less rocking and head-tossing. The second was to feed several
times a day, and the improvement was compounded.

But the biggest and most fundamental change has been to
stop treating the polar bears as if they were seals, committed
to a life on the marine ice. After all, despite appearances,
polar bears evolved from brown bears only recently: perhaps
only 70 000 years or so ago. For many millions of years
before that their ancestors were terrestrial omnivores, and
polar bears retain many of the basic ursine instincts.

With this in mind, Law and his colleagues put straw in the
polar bears’ dens. Of course, they have no straw in the wild,
but they do have snow, which they do shape into “nests”. With
straw to sleep on and to shape to their needs, the bears were

 

is

New Scientist 5 January 1991

less reluctant to go into their dens in the evening. This meant
that their enclosures could be cleaned in safety. So instead of
buckets of chopped meat they could be given entire legs of
beef, whole small animals, fish to dive for and live crabs; an
altogether more challenging and occupying diet. Neither are
polar bears as carnivorous as they seem, even though they are'
the most carnivorous of the bears. In the wild they may dive
for kelp. In captivity (as many zoos now appreciate) they like
branches to play with and to chew; especially willow. They
also like chunks of vegetable, especially if frozen into ice to
provide yet another challenge.

Polar bears also like toys, especially things that ﬂoat. One
of their favourite tricks is to bring a big plastic container
ashore and thump on it with the full weight of their front feet:
a memory, it seems, of the days when they thumped open the
ice dens of seals. In the wild, small polar bears, lacking
weight, do handstands onto the seals’ mini-igloos to break
them open.

Ideally, though, Law would like to take the “polar bears are
bears” philosophy to its logical conclusion, and give them
fields with grass to roam in, earth to dig, trees to climb and
places to get out of the public gaze, as well as the traditional
rocks and water. Such an environment may not resemble the
high Arctic in detail; but in spirit, in its variety and challenges,
it would be far closer to the wild than the unyielding concrete
that usually substitutes for ice.

It is with the Himalayan bears that Glasgow has come
closest to realising its own ideals. The four bears have some
three acres (about 1-4 hectares) of which two-thirds is natural
wooded hillside; and on the ﬂat field at the top of the field
they haVe yet another tall Glasgow-style platform, for the
View. Much of the day they spend searching for raisins and
other titbits scattered around their enclosure, as they would do
in the wild, or climbing for meat, carefully hung by their
keepers on the struts of the platform. To encourage them to

use the whole enclosure, the keepers tie small pieces of meat

to a string and trail them into the corners. The bears, who have
an excellent sense of smell, can follow the trails many hours
later. Sometimes the meat is left for them at the end and
sometimes not. After all, hunting in the wild does not always
(or even usually) end in success. When the Himalayan bears
are not feeding or resting, they are making nests. These have
proved to be so elaborate that visiting biologists have
sometimes accused the keepers of building them. Not so; a
bear builds as dextrously and assiduously as a gorilla.

As Shepherdson emphasises, we cannot just assume that
anything done in the name of behavioural enrichment is good.

, Animals may indeed become addicted to particular playthings.

The recorded gibbon songs could have upset London’s
resident gibbons (though it seems fairly clear that they did
not). It is not enough simply to guess that stereotypy has been
reduced. The amount of pacing or bobbing must be measured
before and after the changes are made, using the kind of
observation patterns that give statistically valid results, just as
with field observations in the wild.

The evidence so far, however, is that behavioural enrichment
certainly can do an enormous amount of good, and indeed can
produce daily routines that in their general content—the
amount of time spent resting, foraging, nest building and
socialising—come very close to the wild. What is needed are
resources, the application of scientific rigour so that progress
is properly monitored and, above all, ingenuity on the part of
keepers. Of course, all these innovations take plenty of the
keepers’ time. But then, says Law, “this can hardly be grudged
as the animals have themselves given all their time to the zoo,
and to the zoo-going public”. L]

 

Colin Tudge is now writing a book on captive breeding called Last
Animals at the Zoo, to be published by Century Hutchinson.

0mm OF WAN PDDEIS FOR BIQIEDIQL RESEARQ-I

RFA RR-90-Ol
Division of Research Resources

Letter of Intent Receipt Date: February 1, 1990
Application Receipt Date: April 4, 1990

HJRPOSE

The Biological Models and Materials Resources Program (BMRP) of the
Division of Research Resources (DRR) is issuing this Request for
Applications (RFA) for the develogmnt of nomamrreliegr medals, in
particular, lower organism (such as fishes, invertebrates, and
microorganisms), in vitro (cell and tissue culture) system, and
nonbiological models (such as mathenatical and computer simulations) for
biomedical research.

BACKGIUJND

The HVIMRP has recently been given program status in ERR to provide for the
development and support of nonmammalian models, such as cell system, lower
organism, and nonbiological system for biomedical researdi. Nomnammalian
model system can, and do, provide opportunities to advance the
understanding of biological processes, and may provide valuable insights
into mechanism of biological function.

Proposals for the study of invertebrates, lower vertebrates,
microorganism, cell and tissue culture system, or mathenatical and
computer approaches should be regarded as having the same potential
importance to biomedical research as proposals for work on system that are
phylogenetically more closely related to humans. Information yielded by
such system can increase substantially the knowledge of human disease and
function.

RESEARCH GOALS AND SGDPE
The overall objective of this RFA is to stimulate research in the

development of nomnamnalian models. The following areas are of particular
interest:

 

This program is described in the catalog of Federal Dcmestic Assistance, No.
13. 306, laboratory Animal Sciences and Primate Research Program. Grants
will be awarded under the authority of the Public Health Service Act, Title
III, Section 301 (Public Law 78-410, as amended 42 USC 241) and
administered under PHS grant policies and Federal Regulations 42 CFR Part 52
and 45 CFR Part 74. This program is not subject to intergovernmental review
requirements of Executive Order 12372 or to Health system Agency review.

 




. I

0 Research on systems that have the potential of becanirq high connectivity
models. High connectivity models are those models where the body of
knowledgeaboutthesystemislarge, andhasresultedinextensivecross
information, or connection, with other systems. An organism that has the
potential of becoming a high connectivity model usually has some information
already known about the system. For example, the metabolism and development
of an organism" may be well understood, but other aspects have not been
explored as fully as possible.

0 Research on organisms that are considered high connectivity models.
There are a few taxa which have been broadly studied from many points of
view, such as E. coli, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, and D. melanogaster.
Applications that explore specific areas to close conspicuous gaps in
information about the model will increase the connectivity of that system.

0 Development of model organisms with special features that have become
useful because the data is transferable to hmmans. An organism may
eventually become a better model or even a high connectivity model if
substantial information on the geneties or functions of that system are
known.

0 Formulation of mathematical models, in particular when

closely coupled to biological experimentation. There are opportunities for

‘ mathematical modeling in many areas of biomedical research and at all levels
of biological organization. ‘

W514 OF SUPPORT

The support mechanism for this program will be the traditional investigator-
initiated research grant. Support for grants is contingent upon receipt of
appropriated funds. It is anticipated that four to six meritorious
applications will be funded. Up to five years of support may be requested.
At the end of the initial project period, investigator-initiated renewal
applications may be submitted for peer review and cmpetition for support
through the traditional mechanism.

Applications responding .to this RFA may be given secordary assignments to
such institutes with overlapping mterest based * on the Division of RM “ "f 1
Grants referral guidelines.‘ '

All current policies and requirements that govern the researdi grant program
of the NIH will apply to grants awarded under this RFA. Awards under this
announcement will be made to foreign institutions only for research of very
unusual merit, need, and promise, and in accordance with Public Health
Service policy governing such awards.

REVIEWHDCEIIJRES

Applications in response to this solicitation will be appropriately peer
reviewed first for scientific and technical merit by initial review groups
which will be convened by the Office of Review, IRR, and secoml by the
National Advisory Research Resources Council at its Septarber 1990 meeting.

 




The factors to be considered in the evaluation of scientific merit of eadu
application will be similar to those used in the review of traditional
project grant applications and include the novelty, originality and
feasibility of approach; the training, experience, and research caupetence
of the investigator(s) , the adequacy of the experimental design; the
suitability of the facilities; and the appropriateness of the requested

budget to the Work proposed.
METHOD OF APPLYING

Letter of Intent.

Prospective applicants are asked to submit, by February 1, "1990, a short
letter of intent that includes a descriptive title of the prr‘lposai research,
and the names and affiliation(s) of proposed key investigators. ‘ The letter
of intent does not canmit the sender to submit an application, nor is it a
requirement for submission of an application. his letter should be sent
to: ‘

AWI Official Favors Release of

Shelter Animals to Research,

1 Mrs. Christine Stevens, President
of the Animal Welfare Institute and
Secretary of that organization’s legis-
lative arm, the Society for Animal
Protective Legislation, reaffirmed her
belief that animals should be pro-
vided from humane society and public
animal shelters for use in medical
research at hearings conducted by the
Senate Commerce Committee in late
March on pending bills to regulate
the traffic in animals sold to
laboratories. ’

The SAPL, which also advocates
enactment of the Clark-Cleveland
bills, S. 1071 and H.R. 5647, has
outspokenly criticized The HSUS for
supporting the Rogers-McIntyre bills,
3. 2576 and H.R. 10049, since their
introduction last year.

In questioning, following a formal
statement on behalf of the SAPL at
the hearing, Mrs. Stevenstestified
that “. . . we have always favored
having animals for non-survival ex-
periments under full anesthesia come
from pounds, and they could also in

r/aqee

"our opinion come from shelters if the
laboratories were carefully regulated
so there would be no question but

what the animals Were actually anesé
thetized, used, and never allowed to
recover from anesthesia. This would
save a great deal of money if this
system were employed, because these
animals would not have to cost any-
thing. They would be animals that '
were about to be destroyed.”

The bill under consideration, and
which Mrs. Stevens was supporting,
would not effectively regulate the use
of animals in laboratories or provide
for proper anesthesia ofanimals under-
going experimentation.

The entire humane movement has
fought consistently against the re-
lease of animals to research from
public and private shelters. Advocacy
of such a practice by any animal wel-
fare organization deserves condemna-
tion since it violates the principles
upon which humane societies are

foun ded.

. gfwcrate boards

Is Dole Irreplaceable?
His Kansas colleague, Senator Nan-

“ﬂy Landon Kassebaum, recently
tnade public a letter urging him to
[fpjun again. He was nearly 1r1eplace—
ble, she wrote, both in the “frustrat—

mong Senate Republicans and in the
« _ pic of a leader who “peisuaded the
lh’ite House to listen.”

A1,? *4; Mr. Dole earned such credentials “

inrough dedication to President
. ush’ s interests -—— even when others
“ave suspected that he was not con-

"; Liginced of the political wisdom of a
.; hite House position. “There has
een no more effective advocate of
113,31 he President’ 3 position nor protector
'r 1;,ij the President’s prerogatives,” said

with the President’s string of
.Lﬁi stained vetoes.

‘1 r 1"" “My job is to reflect the Adminis- “

‘lsratlon view, get as much of their
1. rogram as we can,- ” Mr. Dole said.
.1 1 . doing so, he gives the public no hint
, 1 the disdain he showed in his own
'~ 988 Presidential campaign and his

1 ”41% tter primary battle with Mr. Bush
:‘g New Hampshire. RepubliCan sena-
airs say he gives them no hint either.

”a 1; Generally Dole the legislative lead- ;
1 1 ‘;‘r has much less of a sharp tongue, on ;

lEmost any subject, than Dele the
' “.ndidate. It’ s more responsible but
m” may be less fun.

; “I don’t think he terribly enjoys ,
mgr minority leader and he enjdyed ,,
less in the last year or .two, ” said:

Senator Warren B Rudman of New
Hampshire,M1. Dole’s diehard ally 1n
the 1988 primary there.

Pushing the Administration’s view
was a more satisfying job for Mr.
Dole as majority leader in 1985 and
1986. But'the 1988 elections put the
Republicans in the. minority, and
their numbers shrank in 1988 and
1990. After November’s election of
Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania, the
Republicans. were stuck on the short
end of a 57-to—43 balance in: the Sen—
ate.

A Minority Leader’s Dream

“I’d like to be majority leader,”
Mr. Dole said. “Obviously you never
know around this place, there can be
big sweeps, but I don’t think that’s
going to happen in ’92, so I wouldn’t
want to lose any seats.”

With still fewei seats, “you’d still
have is make the same fights,” he

said But the outcome would be ob- ‘

struction, not influence, and even if
this year was frustrating, Mr. Dole

had a powerful impact

On civil rights, one of the few 1m-

; portant‘b‘ills passed, he kept pressing ;
for talks between the White HouSe 1
and. Senator John C Danforth the

publicangc whose sum~

in the Senate,
I‘ehmd the L111 es

' .merlong appeal to his party to aban-

don the quota issue and work for
compromise on the job-discrimina-
tion measure kept it within reach of
enactment. But Mr. Dole also worked
to keep Mr. Danforth from taking
enough Republicans publicly commit-
ted to him is provide strength to

override a veto in the Senate.

The Missourian was tantalizingly
close. “You have to choose between
supporting the President and Jack
Danfm th, ” he iecalls Mr. Dole telling
a Republican caucus

Buying time by dragging things out
on the floor, using parliamentary
stalling tactics, Mr. Dole confronted

President Bush and his aides with the
uncertainties of the situation in the

Senate. He assembled a group of un—
committed Republican senators
whom the Administration can usually
count on to visit the White House.

When several of the senators all but ‘

threatened to vote to override, Mr.

Bush sent C. Boyden Gray, the White

House counsel, to make a deal.

Afterward, Mr. Dole loyally and “

routinely insisted that the votes to
sustain a veto had been there all the
time. But. he does not expend much
energv trying to convince people of
that. Ins tead, he defines his function
on this bill as beginning with being a
bit uncomfortable at opposing the
measure in 1989 and sustaining Mr.
Bush’s veto.

“From a party standpoint, it was
not in cur interest to get locked in,”
he said. “We had to bring everybody
along fairly slowly; we had a few in
our party who thought that would be
the great issue, we shouldn’t drop it.”

A Tactical Commitment

On civil rights, Mr. Dole had no
legislative ax to grind, though an in-
ventive aide, Dennis Shea, kept pep-
pering both sides with compromise
suggestions.

But on unemployment, he had a

'counterproposal as soon as the first of
three efforts to provide extra benefits
for people out of work at least half a -

year came to the floor in July. The
final versions passed last month.

Mr. Dole’s commitment Was tacti—
cal, not principled. Indeed, his was
the loudest “aye” when the Senate
passed the Democratic bill.after re-

jecting his plan on Aug. 1. Butthe,
alternative provided cover for Re- :4

publicans until the White HouSe fi-
nally felt the issue’s strong poIitical
Winds and abandoned its arguments

.y.that the benefits 'were not needed
~. .because the recession was ending and
that extended benefits w0uld deter»

Paul Hos/sefroThe New York Times _

On the eve of deciding Whether to run for a fifth term, Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, says he is'

l

the jobless from seeking work.
{“My View was ‘We don’t want to
gi e anybody unemployment bene-

fis’ was not a winner,” he said.

EHe conceded “it took a while to get
it:done,” from July until November.
What was in the final legislative

package owed at least as much to

Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas
Democrat who heads the Senate Fi—
nance Committee, and Representa-
tive Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois
Democrat who heads the House Ways
and Means Committee, as it did to
Mr. Dole. And the House minority
leader, Representative Robert H. Mi-
chel of Illinois, probably did as much
as Mr. Dole to get the White House
interested in negotiating.

The Flow’ 5 the Thing

But Mr. Dole kept the game alive,
for the conflicting interests of Mr.
Bush and his party. First he persuad-

' ' fed enough Republicans to cast a risky

.jvote with the President to sustain an
chtober veto. Then he kept demand-
ihg a compromise to protect Republi-
Scans from Democratic accusations

that they had killed the benefits.

_ But even if Mr Dole is good at it,
' there isn’t as much joy in influencing

‘leg1slat10n as in controlling the flow.
He has been majority and minority

deader under Republican pre51dents

but he envies the Democratic majo1-
ity leader, saying, “I always thought

the stiongest position would be the;

position Mitchell, is in —— to be major-
ity leader when the other guy is in
charge downtown, and then you can
pretty well bring things to a halt
around here.”

His job is complicated not just by;

an insufficient number of Republi-

cans in the Senate, but by the divi- ‘

sions‘ among those who are there. Mr.

. Rudman said Mr. Dole is bothered by

their lack of support, especially when
other party leaders do not back him.

Some moderates believe that he
neglects their interests in backing

Mr. Bush. And so do some 'conserva-;
'tives; when SenatOr Malcolm 'Wallop'
. of Wyoming criticized Mr. Dole’ s sup-

port of last year’s budget accord, Mr.

; Dole said that if Mr. Wallop wanted/to

be the party leader they could hold an'
election that minute. Mr. Wallop’

backed down.

Mr. Dole’ s sometimes sh 1rp tongue
makes enemies in the Sent te. While

.-'Mr Mitchell holds him in high regard

for limiting the chaos that Senate.
rules seem to demand, there are oth-

er Democrats who have less sympa-, '
, thy for him as he routinely delays

floor consideration of many major
Democratic bills.

And if he could wOrk to move the,
White House on some issues, he did
not always succeed. He tried to
smooth over the dispute over the rule
bairing abortion counseling by doc-
tors in Federally financed family
planning clinics.

But the White House, at the insist-,3

,ence of John H. Sununu, President

Bush’s chief of staff until his recent;

- resignation, would not compromise

In the end Mr. Dole’ s decision on
seeking another term may Well rest
on numbers and his sense of how
Republican Senate candidates may,
fare next fall. For now, he insists, “I
like my job.”

Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, one
of the most enthusaistic Dole support-
ers in the Republicans’ conservative
wing, said. “I think he’ s really on the
border. If the numbers were closer, I -.

tthink he would quit.”

Attention: Mrs Christine Stevens,

Dear Hrs Stevens, ‘
The Animal Welfare Foundation of Canada recently
embarked upon a joint project with the University of
Guelph, in southern Ontario, to establish an Animal
Welfare Reference Library. The objective is to build

up a comprehensive collection of reference materials
that will be readily accessible by anyone in horth
America through a simple desk~top computer terminal.

We" ‘3

ins University of Guelph was chosen for several
reasons: It is arguably Canada's leading school of Veter-
inary Medicine; it is also one of Canada's largest
Agricultural Colleges; and so they already have a
substantial library relating to animals and animal problems.
In addition to this, they recently announced their

intention to establish a Chair in Animal Welfare, which

we expect to see in existence as soon as funding is

in place.

During the past year, the A.W.F. has been collecting
bibliographies and materials from organizations across
and our inital collection of materials has
already been passed along to the University Library.

I am now writing to Humane Societies and similar
organizations in the U.S. asking for their assistance.
Could you provide us with a copy of your current
bibliography and also a sample copy of your newsletter ?
I would emphasise that we are not asking you to donate
anything (although I am sure the Library would not refuse
anything offered), It is anticipated that the University
will check bibliographies against their current holdings
and would then contact you directly regarding the
acquisition of copies, further information or details.

see over.....

 




The Guelph Veterinary School andrAgricultural
College already have an extensive collection of materials
relating to their own specialized fields. What is
missing and desperately needed, is reliable factual

Dog hunting idea opposed ( 221-5"? ,

LAKE CITY — (UPI) -—- A proposal to open portions
of the Osceola National Forest to dog hunting pits envi-
ronmental concerns against a Southern tradition.

The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commis-

. sion is acceptingpublic comment on two proposals to

allow dog hunting in the national forest. ‘ j

One idea is to open a large, tract for hunters to use
dogs to chase fox, raccoon, oppossum and bobcat from . ,
July 1 to Oct. 1. The otherwould let hunters use dogs to
chase deer in the Pinhook Swamp addition to the forest.

Shefﬁeld Spradley, president of the Suwannee River-
Dog Hunters Association, said dog hunting is an old
Southern tradition that's getting squeezed by encroach-
ing development. r , ._ 4 '

But Frank Sedmera of the Four Rivers Audubon
Society argues the hunters cause litter and noise that
threaten endangered species. ,

Keyser, West Virginia, is a small, quiet town and the
of Potomac State College. Not much went on in the
until an afternoon in December.

The enclosed articles tell the story of a Collie dog
named Casey and the cruel and unnecessary death she faced
on that day. Something has to be done about this and other
such occurrences. The people who do these things must be
punished.

Please help to see that the ones responsible for this
DO NOT get away free.

Dear Dr. Vasile,

I am very glad to know of your concern for whales and dolphins. Under separate
cover, we have sent you a copy of Whales vs Whalers, The Global War Against Small
Cetaceans, a leaﬂet on the subject and a listing of publications available from the

Animal Welfare Institute. Let us know if your are interested in other items. We want
to be helpful.

Enclosed is a copy of The Animal Web’are Institute Quarterly which we distributed at
the last meeting of the IWC. The next meeting is scheduled for Reykjavik, Iceland in
May. If you wish to send us a letter of support for whale and dolphin protection from

your organization, we would be pleased to haVe it and to make it known to other like
minded groups. ‘

 

' Sincerely,

 

Christine Stevens
President

~waear_Governor Hickel:

 

 

 

 

Congratulaions on your election as GovernOr of Alaska: We
are especially happy that you won the election because your
splendid action in placing the eat whales on the Endangered
Species list is engraved forever in our memories. You saved them
at a critical period when they were going downhill at*a shocking
rate. You deserve the greatest credit for the progress that has
been made over the years. ' ‘

We have circulated your excellent statement widely ever
since 1971: 'It would be a crime beyond belief if in the same
decade that we walked on the moon we also destroyed the largest
animal that ever was. The humpback whale, a playful monster ‘
renowned for its unearthly songs and foam-spattering leaps, has
also been reduced to the point of possible extinction. The
bowhead and two right whale species. almost oxterminated by early
hunters. have never really recovered. Only the California gray ‘
whale. after deCades of complete protection, has made a partial
‘recovery.' ‘ g _ "" * ‘ .

Your intervention is needed again with respett to another
ﬁegnificent animal: the wolf. I hope will see that the
persecution which wolves have been suffering in Alaska will be
reversed. Alaska is fortunate to still have wild wolves, for
,meet states have entirely lost them through predator control

e ceases. It deserves the kind of caretul scrutiny you gave to
commercial whaling and the same kind of effective action to slow
the killing of wolves. >

With admiration and respect.

Dear Christine:

Annually, your Christmas greetings warm
soul - lift my spirits and give me hope.

Now I am concerned about animal testing
some medicines. If done under strict standards
you think it permissible—~ only, of course, if
reliable experts feel it is the only way to
genuine testing.

Could we talk about it sometimes?
Please continue to be an inspiration to
many ot_us.
