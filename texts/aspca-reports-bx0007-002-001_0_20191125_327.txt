ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT. -

 

Ladies and Gentlemen :

Two years ago, when it was my duty to report to you the
operation of our Society during the year 1903, I called your
attention to the well known fact that the hospitals and other
charitable institutions of New York were then confronted with
heavy deﬁcits in their receipts as compared with their necessary
annual expenditures. The cause, of course, was not obscure,
since the year then closing had been a year of reaction from
immoderate and unwise speculation which had plunged thou—
sands into poverty and had caused heavy losses to many
thousands of others. Notwithstanding this general condition
of things, I had the satisfaction to report that our Society had
not only been able to pay every dollar of the year’s expenses,
but had also extinguished the last mortgage with which its
headquarters was burdened, so that we were entering upon
the New Year, 1904, free from debt, and, for the ﬁrst time
in our corporate history, owning a building specially erected
for our own work, free and clear of all encumbranCe. I re—
joice to think that the charitable institutions of our city are
less pressed for money than they were two years ago, and if
we were constrained to limit our View to the twelve months
which have just ended, I should be obliged to admit that some
much desired extensions of our work have been postponed
because our means were not such as to sanction them. But
a larger view is more encouraging, since it shows that claims
now falling due to the society will place it within theynext

few weeks in a better ﬁnancial position than it has been since
its foundation. That is the ﬁrst word of cheer that I have
to address to you in this opening meeting of the year.
Twelve months ago, by way of answer to the virulent at-
tacks to which our society had been subjected by persons who
were never known to do any single practical good work for the
protection of animals, I mentioned the fact that there is but
one Society for the protection of animals in all the world
which does so large an annual amount of work for that cause
as this Society. 'That was the fact then, and it remains the
fact now; and the statement, made then, is now repeated as
the only answer we shall make to the incessant slanders which
are circulated against us. We have shown in detail the utter
falsehood of the accusations, only to ﬁnd them forthwith re-
printed, as if they had not been refuted. But as time passes, we
are learning that the virulence of malice may defeat itself;
and the second word of good cheer that I have to speak to-
day is the assurance that these outcries have made no impres-
sion upon the real friends of our Society. In the year just

past we have had more new members added to our list than

in any previous year, with one or two exceptions; we have
also had fewer withdrawals ; and so, with no special effort what—
ever, we enter on the new year stronger in that respect than
in any bygone year. Moreover, we have heard of no bequests
to our Society being cancelled by testators, and there is sim-
ply nothing known to me that indicates the slightest falling
off of interest in any person or class of persons who ever were
sincerely interested in our work. Internally as well as ﬁnan-
cially, I believe that our Society was never stronger, nor even
quite so strong as at the present hour.

In matters which can be tabulated as statistics there are
variations from year to year for which it is not always pos—
sible to ﬁnd satisfactory explanations. During the past year,
however, there has been only one exception-to the general ad-
vance,as will appear on an. inspection of the following state-

ment :

I think that so general an increase of apparent efﬁciency
ought to justify a certain conﬁdence in the character and
good discipline of theSociety’s corps of ofﬁcers.

LEGI SLATIO N .

The extraordinary mildness of the ﬁrst half of the passing
winter makes me tremble at the thought of the severe weather
which may lie before us. If we should have any such down-
fall of snow and sleet as we had two years ago, the amount
of animal suffering that would ensue would be frightful. The
lesson of that former time has not been learned, and no prep-
aration has been made to meet the emergency that may soon
be upon us. The lesson is that the City of New York must
be prepared to sand its streets in certain sorts of weather,
under penalty of a virtual stoppage of trafﬁc, and of inde-
scribable suffering to animals. Besides the necessity caused
by snow and ice, another unforeseen and unexpected factor
of serious mischief has appeared in the quantities of oily sub-
stance which are dropped on the asphalt by motors of various
kinds. Mixing as it does with the peculiarly slippery dust of
the asphalt, this oily substance makes the pavement treacher-
ously dangerous to horses, and in times of ice and sleet it
will make our most crowded thoroughfares about as slippery
as greased glass. For that condition of things there is no
remedy but a liberal use of sand, and we deeply regret to say
that a bill to provide for the sanding of the streets in times
of necessity failed to pass the legislature at its last session.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8

We are glad, however, to say that a new bill for the same pur—
pose has been introduced in the Assembly with the approval
of the Mayor and the Commissioner of Street Cleaning. It
cannot be too quickly passed, since every day’s delay takes
an additional chance of evil and distress with which the city
is not yet prepared to cope.

I regret to report the defeat in our State Legislature of
a special bill, introduced at the request of the Rochester So-
ciety, intended to prevent the docking of horse’s tails. It
is the only special bill for the protection of animals that I
have ever been able to approve, because experience has am-
ply justiﬁed the belief of Mr. Bergh that every special law
is almost certain to weaken the effectiveness of a good gen-
eral law; and as the State law of New York for the protection,
of animals is as nearly perfect as any human statute can be,
I have always feared to weaken it by special legislation. In
this case, however, there was no question of the cruelty of
docking; that is not denied; and because it cannot be denied,
the crime is committed with such secrecy as to bafﬂe discov-
ery, and so passes unpunished. In that fact lay the neces-
sity for special legislation, and the merit of the bill was that
it would have been effective. I regret to say that the influ-
ence of a crude and cruel fashion was too strong for the
claims of justice and humanity which were strongly presented.
and so the bill was lost.

The defeat of another attempted piece of legislation has
caused us no regret ; I refer toithe application of the so—called
Henry Bergh Humane Society for admission to equal rights
and privileges with our own Society in the City of New York.
Its leaders were not known ever in their lives to have done
anything whatever for the protection of animals, and their
assumption of the name of Henry Bergh was a curious com—
ment on their bitter animosity to the Society which Henry
Bergh founded. Its object was too obvious to be mistaken,
since it was the manifest hope that their adoption of that
name might draw to them some of the contributions or be-

of suffering that can be inﬂicted even under that regulation,
though there should be no evasion of its restriction, would be
diﬁicult to describe. Some intelligent conception of it may
indeed be formed if one will fancy a herd of cattle to be driven
in haste to a shipping point somewhere in the Far West; then
to be crowded together in narrow cars where there is no room
to lie down, and carried over the hot plains without food or
water for twenty-eight hours; only to continue their jour-
ney for another twenty-eight hours of thirst and famine;
and then for another, and another. One turns almost sick
to think of it; but this the most humane legislatiOn, if it
ought not rather to be called the inhuman legislation, that
could be obtained from the Congress of the United States.
And still it does not satisfy the American Live Stock Asso—
ciation, wihich proposes to amend the statute so that the hours
of legal drought and starvation shall be increased from twen—
ty-eight to forty! The passage of that amendment would be
a hideous piece of legislative brutality; but if it were not
watched the heedlessness of some and the indifference of
others, would undoubtedly result in the passage of that hor-
rible amendment. In evidence of this, I may say that the
proposed amendment, defeated in the last Congress, was
forthwith introduced into the present House of Represent-
atives and must be again defeated.

SIGNS OF ENCOURAGEMENT.

On the whole, I feel that the year 1905 has been a good
year for our cause both in this country and in other lands.
There was a time when it was everywhere spoken against
as a fad of sentimentalism; it is now at least respected as
a cause which founds its claims on justice. Abstractly, we
might almost say that our case is popular, if it were not that
popularity is so commonly connected with ignorance. Igno-
rance, I feel to be our densest and most dangerous enemy,
and therefore I rejoice to observe in all directions an impulse

moving those who love animals to spread knowledge con-
cerning them which shall bespeak kind treatment in their be—
half. And on the other side, when I ﬁnd ferry companies
making arrangements to protect horses from the biting win-
ter winds, and providing electric capstans to assist the teams
to haul their wagons from boats when the tide is unfavorable
I recall a time, not very distant, when no such thing would
have been possible, and I have faith to believe that the hu~
mane education of mankind is proceeding at a higher rate
'of speed than has been thought. With that last word of cheer
I wish you all a Happy New Year.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT.’

 

There has been no material change in the character of the
work of animal protection during the past year, but the vol-
ume of work has been greater. As will be seen by the sta-
tistics published elsewhere in this report,- many thousands
of animals have been inspected by our agents with a view
of determining their physical condition and ﬁtness for labor.
Our agents are men of experience, many of the-m long in
the service of the Society, and are just in their dealings with
offenders in arriving at a conclusion as to the action to be
taken in each individual case. .In many instances their de—
cisions have been adversely criticised and their ofﬁcial in-
tegrity questioned by those who, beyond a desire for brief
notoriety, have no interest whatever in the merits of the
case. Many well—meaning people err in their judgment from
lack of knowledge of the law’s requirements as well as ig—
norance of what constitutes legally deﬁned acts of cruelty.

Only those actively engaged in the work of animal pro—
tection are aware of the many c0mplications which arise
from time to time; for instance, a horse is found suffering
from a broken leg; the Society is notiﬁed; an agent is sent;
he advises that the horse be shot at once; the man in charge
refuses consent; the agent must wait for the owner; the
latter cannot be found; the horse is suffering. >Now, as the
law provides that “no person can be deprived of his personal
property without his consent,” the agent is powerless to act
unless he assumes the responsibility and humanely destroys
the injured animal and risks a civil action for its value.
Suits for damages have been institute-d against the Society

 

 

 




 

 

 

15.

by persons in cases where suffering animals found lying in
the street, disabled and past recovery, have been humanely
destroyed without waiting for the consent of the owner. It
is the general impression that the Society possesses arbitrary
powers to dispose of injured animals as the-y please. Such is
not the case, however, and in no instance, except where an
animal is found abandoned and in the judgment of two rep-
utable citizens to be diseased, injured, disabled and past re-
covery, can an agent of the Society take summary action.
Yet, on several occasions, citizens when called upon to aid
the agent as the law requires, have refused, on the ground
that they feared to become involved in a law suit.

STOCK YARDS

The stock yards of the city are visited every day by the
agents of the Society who inspect every part of the premises
before leaving. Agents are there in the early morning on
the arrival of cattle from the West and points throughout
the State. They are present when the animals are unloaded
from the cars and see to it that they are treated humanely
and properly fed and watered while waiting transit to their
destination.

SLAUGHTER HOUSES

The slaughtering of animals for human food is now con—
ducted in a humane and cleanly manner. The following will
serve to describe the methods now in force in most of the
abattoirs of the city:

On arrival the cattle follow a team of oxen (trained for
the purpose) up a runway to the roof, where pens are ar-
ranged to keep them so that the-y cannot crowd each other.
Fresh water, bran mash and 'hay are provided. The pens
are covered on top, ventilation being supplied through open-
ings in the twelve—foot wall surrounding the roof. The
pens are kept scrupulously clean. When required for slaugh—

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16

ter, the animals are led down a runway to the ﬂoor below
and are placed in separate pens, each of which has its own
door to the killing ﬂoor, and from which they are taken one
at a time (the door being closed immediately to‘ allow another
to enter therein.) The hind legs of the steer are drawn
together in a sling and raised by electric machinery to the
position required by the ofﬁcial slaughterer, who with one
stroke of a keen knife eighteen inches long severs the jugu-
lar vein. Every element approaching cruelty, not alone in
the treatment of live stock on its arrival but up to the end,
has been minimized owing to the persistent “meddling,” as
it has been termed of the Society. It would take up more
space and time than can be accorded here, to state in detail
what the Society has done toward the betterment of live stock
transportation and the abolition of wanton cruelty which at
one time prevailed in the slaughter houses of this city.

Dry cows, hogs, sheep, calves and other small animals are
shipped to this city on the cars by farmers living up the
State. Many of the shippers are guilty of gross acts of
cruelty, if the information received by the Society from time
to time be true. It is said that dry cows are deprived of
water for hours before shipment, and that bags containing
salt are attached to the animals in such a manner that they
can eat it while on the way to the station in order to
increase thirst; that arriving .at their destination and be~
fore being sold the animals are given as much water as they
can drink so as to increase weight. Our agents have been
sent throughout the State with instructions to spare no ex—
pense or labor in their search for such cases. They have
followed herds of cows for miles, through country roads,
but as yet have failed to ﬁnd a single case as reported. While
engaged in this particular service the agents have found live
calves of tender age at railroad stations awaiting shipment,
left by the shipper unsheltered and without food or drink
for several hours. The wants of the animals have been
attended to and the shipper or owner sought for. Our agents

19

throughout the State have been instructed to be vigilant and
to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law all persons neglect-
ing animals as described above.

Although not always successful in the pursuit of offenders
of the class named, we have succeeded in bringing relief to
many abandoned and unsheltered animals. Starving horses,
cows and other animals have been found by our agents in
isolated places; those past recovery were humanely destroyed
and necessary shelter and sustenance provided for the sur-
v1vors.

LIVE POULTRY

The trafﬁc in live poultry of all kinds has been greater the
past year than heretofore, resulting in the shipment to this
city of many thousand crates of such animals. Upon arrival
here the crates and coops are examined by our agents
and if it is found that no food or drink is pro—
vided or that the Crates are not of sufﬁcient size to allow the
inmates to move about without discomfort, the eVil is reme-
died without delay. In justice to the dealers I must say that
there is no reluctance or delay on their part to comply with
the requirements when found necessary.

The trucking of live poultry from the several markets is
done in as humane a way as possible, considering the crude
methods now employed. It has been suggested to the truck-
ing companies that vehicles specially designed for the carrying
of poultry be constructed, having in view the safety of the an—
imals from the injuries which frequently occur. The matter
is under advisement and I feel conﬁdent that in the near
future a better method for poultry transportation will be
adopted.

STABLES

Owing to the constant vigilance of the agents of the Society
and the co-operation of the Board of Health, many so--called
stables have been ordered put in sanitary condition and ﬁt

for animal shelter. There are many, however, still in ex-
istence which are located underground, but owing to lack of
legal authority the Society is powerless to compel the owners
to remove the animals. It does insist, however, that as
much ventilation as possible must be supplied andconstant
care exercised on the part of stable managers to see that the
places are kept thoroughly clean and habitable for horses.

C'A'NALS
Special Agents residents of towns through which the water
ways of the State are located have been vigilant in the dis—
charge of their several duties, and many horses have been
suspended from labor owing to temporary physical disabil-
ities, and otherwise relieved. Thanks to the introduction of

electricity and steam power it is only a question of the near
future when animal power will be discontinued entirely.

AMBULANCE AND DERRICK SERVICE

The usefulness of this department of the Society’s work
is fully demonstrated every succeeding year. During the
past year the ambulances were called into- service eight hun-
red and ﬁfteen times to remove sick and disabled horses
from the street to hospitals or stables. The derrick has been
used on several occasions to rescue horses that had fallen
into excavations and to save others from drowning.

DOG AND COCK FIGHTS

Agents of the Society, acting with the police, raided the
stable at 66 East 8 5th Street, Manhattan, early in January 1905,
where a dog ﬁght was in progress, and arrested twelve men
found surrounding an impoverished dog pit, made up of
bales of hay, in which two bull dogs were ﬁercely ﬁghting.
The prisoners were tried by the Court of Special Sessions,
convicted and sentenced to pay ﬁnes ranging from $10 to $200.
The dogs were forfeited to the Society, pursuant to the law,

and, after being examined by a veterinary surgeon and found
injured past recovery, were humanely destroyed.

April 8th, 1905, the Society’s agent stationed at Yonkers,
and Captain Woodruff of the City Police, raided a saloon
on the Saw Mill Road, in the cellar of which a cockﬁght
was in progress. Outside the pit, which was an old affair having
evidently been in use for a long time, was found a dead bird
Whose body was badly torn, while in an empty flour barrel
nearby was found the victor of the ﬁght, but in a battered,
weak and exhausted condition. Inside the pit were two game
cocks battling for life. The handler and twelve witnesses
were arrested, convicted and sentenced to pay ﬁnes ranging
from $10 to $20. The cocks and pit were seized and subse-
quently forfeited to the Society and disposed of as required
by the law.

These so-called sports of Dog and Cock Fighting and kin-
dred animal brutalities are fast becoming things of the past,
owing to the vigilance 0f the Society and the police.

SPECIAL AGENTS

Special Agents other than those attached to Head-'
quarters and the Brooklyn ofﬁce report that the work
of animal protection throughout the State is wisely and judi-
ciously carried on. While there are cases which warrant the
prosecution of offenders there are others where advice and
warning have been sufﬁcient. “It is sufﬁcient to know that
I have authority to enforce the laws for the protection of
animals in order to 'warn those who heretofore have been
known to be cruel to their live stock to treat the latter more
kindly,” writes an agent. In substance this expresses the in-
ﬂuence which prevails Wherever an agent of the Society is

located.
INCIDENTAL

To report in detail every phase of animal cruelty brought
to the attention of the Society from time to time would

 




 

 

 

24

take up time and space which cannot be accorded; yet, in
addition to such, our agents are constantly on the lookout
for the careless driver who neglects to remove the feed bag
after his horse has ﬁnished its meal; the grocer or milkman
who drops glass bottles in the street to the danger of horses;
broken blinders; small horses with large collars and vice
versa———causing sores on the animal’s body; tight bridles;
short check reins; short traces; broken shafts; horses im-
properly harnessed, or working on the wrong side; unblanketed
horses, and many other features of the work too numerous
to mention, but our agents bring relief and comfort to thou-
sands of uncomplaining help-less creatures. _

Markets, ferries, city dumps, hack stands, excavations, street
openings, place-s of amusement and all other places where
animals are employed, bought and sold, are visited, and when-
ever it is found necessary to interfere the evil is remedied
without delay, and everything is being done to mitigate ani-
mal suffering and enforce the laws of the State.

The undersigned commends to favorable notice the efﬁ—
ciency of the uniformed and plain clothes staff of ofﬁcers
under his command, attached to Headquarters and the Brook-
lyn Department, likewise the resident agent at Yonkers, White
Plains, Queens County and Richmond County.

To the City Magistrates of Greater New York, the Judges
of the Court of Special Sessions, First and Second Divisions,
and the higher Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction and to all de-
partments of the Municipal Government I desire to express
thanks and appreciation for the many courtesies extended
to the Society and its agents, and for their interest in the
work in which the Society is engaged.

Respectfully submitted,
CHARLES H. HANKINSON,
Superintendent.

was found guilty and was sentenced to pay a ﬁne Of $25 or to be im-
prisoned for ten days. The ﬁne was paid by the bondsman.

JAMES FERRIs, Of Portchester, N. Y., an assistant foreman at the

default thereof to be imprisoned for ﬁfteen days. , The ﬁnes were paid.

FOR driving a horse and mule to a heavy dirt—truck, the horse lame in
the near fore foot and otherwise in wretched condition, the mule also
totally unﬁt for work, William King was arrested by a Special Agent
of the Society and was arraigned on the charge Of cruelty before
City Magistrate Henry A. Steinert, of the Second District Court.
At the Court Of Special Sessions, First Division, King was tried by
Justices Deuel, McKean and Olmsted. He pleaded not guilty; but
the testimony of a veterinary surgeon and Of the Society’s agent,
who had tho-roughly examined the animals, convicted him. He was
sentencedto pay a ﬁne Of $25, with the alternative of ﬁve days in
the city prison.

JOSEPH WINGERT, a farmer Of Caneadea, N. Y., was arrested by a
Special Agent Of the Society on the charge of cruelly beating an Old

comb on a warrant, and was taken to Oramel, N. Y., where he was
arraigned before Justice of the Peace D. W. Knight. For his atro—
cious cruelty, Wingert was sentenced to pay a ﬁne of $20, with the

FOR running his horse on the highway between Oxford, N. Y., and

guilty. The justice ﬁned him $10.

FOR driving an exhausted horse attached to a coal wagon, the animal
having on its shoulder a sore that measured 2x254 inches, the collar
of the harness soaked in blood, George Spe-rling, a driver, was arrested
by a Special Agent of the Society. Arraigned before Magistrate
Joseph Pool, of the Second District Court, Sperling was held in $200
bail for trial at Special Sessions. On the morning of his arrest the
prisoner admitted that he had harnessed the horses himself. At the
trial, however, he denied having harnessed the horses, and stated that
he was not a regular employee of John McDermott & Son, the coal
merchants who owned the animal. The day of his arrest was, he de—
clared, the ﬁrst occasion on which he had driven the horses. He
also stated that he had not known of the sore under the collar. En-
crusted with blood and matter, the collar looked as if it had not
been cleaned for weeks. Justices Deuel, Olmsted and 'McKean, of
the Court of Special. Sessions, First Division, convicted Sperling of
cruelty to animals, sentencing him to pay a ﬁne of $10, with the
atlernative of three days in the city prison.

JOHN A. REHN, a driver for Machael Healy, a truckman, was ar-
rested by a Special Agent of the Society on the charge of driving
a disabled horse to a runabout, another disabled horse tied behind.
Both horses were found on examination to be suffering from chronic
dislocation of the knee pan. The prisoner was arraigned before Justice
Phelps, of the New Rochelle Police Court, and the driver explained
that he had been ordered by his employer to take the horse from the
City of New York to New Canaan to pasture. It was shown to the
satisfaction of the court that the horses were in no condition to
walk that distance. At the suggestion of Justice Phelps, Rehn was
paroled to go to New York and bring his employer, Healy, to court.
At the trial the prisoner pleaded guilty. Sentence was suspended with
the understanding that the horse in the better condition was to be
properly cared for by the owner, and the other wretched creature was
to be humanely destroyed by the Society’s ofﬁcer. ‘

FREDERICK GEIS, a huckster, recklessly driving along Main Street,
New Rochelle, ran over a man. In his hurry to get away from the
scene of the accident, he urged his horse to still greater speed, using
his whip violently. The Society’s Special Agent saw the reckless
driving and gave chase. In a little time the horse fell, and before the
animal could be brought to its feet the agent arrested Geis on the
charge of reckless driving. It was «learned that the injured man had
been merely stunned by the fall, and only his wrist was run over by
the wagon. Arraigned before Justice Edgar M. Phelps, of the Police
Court, the prisoner pleaded guilty to the charge of abusing his horse,
and was ﬁned $10. As he could not pay the ﬁne, he was committed for
ten days to the county jail.

TONY SCHMIDT, a Russian, who gave his occupation as a horse dealer,
was arrested by a Special Agent of the Society on the charge of work-
ing a bay horse to a wagon while the animal was lame from a running
quittor in the right forefoot. Arraigned before City Magistrate
Robert C. Cornell, of the Fourth District Court, Schmidt was held
in $300 bail. Before Justices McKean, Olmsted and Zeller, of the
Court of Special Sessions, First Division, it was shown that the de-
fendant had bought horse, wagon and harness for the sum of $19.50
at Fiss, Doerr & Carroll’s stables, and that when arrested he was
attempting to sell the horse. The Society’s Agent also proved to the
court’s satisfaction that the defendant was a horse dealer who regularly
bought and sold old, lame and decrepit horses. The prisoner pleaded
not guilty. He was however, sentenced to thirty days in the city
prison.

THE Society’s Special Agent at Yonkers received a telephone call
from Police Captain Fred. H. Woodruff, informing him that a cock
ﬁght was planned to take place in Fischer’s Hotel on the Saw Mill
. River Road. In company with the captain, the Society’s agent drove

at once to the hotel, where they found a man in the barroom lounging
carelessly over the bar, and in a room back of the bar two men playing
pool. Captain Woodruff guarded a door leading to the yard while
the Society’s agent went downstairs to the cellar. Before the agent
reached the bottom of the stairs he saw a cock-pit arranged in the
middle of the cellar, with a canvas ﬂoor and lighted by electricity.
The agent at once called the captain to follow him. In the cock—pit
they found a .gamecock, with the man Fischer holding another game-
cock in his hand to excite the birds to ﬁght. Outside the pit a dead
cock lay, still warm. In a ﬂour barrel near the pit another cock
was found. Fifteen men were ranged about the pit, but at the ap-

pearance of the ofﬁcers three tried to escape by running to the backdoor.
The Society’s agent jumped into the cock—pit and took the bird from
Fischer, and then stood guard at the backdoor. Some of the men
ran for the stairs to escape by that way, but they were promptly ar—
rested by Captain Woodruff. In all, twelve men were taken to Police
Headquarters under arrest, and in the patrol wagon were the" three
live cocks, one dead cock, :1 pair of shears, a cock-pit, the canvas
ﬂooring and a blanket. The prisoners gave their names as C. H.
Fischer, Charles McKeever, John White, John Murray, John James,
Lawrence Collins, Harry E. Varian, Dennis Crough, Conrad Henkel,
Patrick Sullivan, Thomas Cheehan and William Crough. Arraigned
before Justice William C. Kellogg, of the City Court, Charles Fischer
pleaded not guilty. Several times the case was adjourned, but Fischer
ﬁnally appeared with counsel and pleaded guilty. He was ﬁned by
the justice $20, which he paid. The gamecocks were humanely de-
stroyed by the Society.

NICOL0 ROMANO was arrested on the charge of cruelty to animals
in using as one of a “hitching team” a horse that was lame in the
off knee, the entire limb swollen to great size. There were three
holes in the knee. The animal was also suffering from a running
quittor in the near hind foot, and was too lame to be compelled to
walk a step. At the time of his arrest by the "Society’s Special Agent
Romanq told the agent he had been ordered by the foreman of the
stable to use the horse, and had been using him for two days. Ar—
raigned before City Magistrate John B. Mayo, of the Fifth District
Court, the prisoner refused, however, to repeat the statement. It
was learned that his employer is Patrick Red‘dy. The prisoner was
held in $200 bail to answer to the Court of Special Sessions, Reddy
furnishing bonds. By Justices Hinsdale, Wyatt and Zeller, of the
Court of Special Sessions, First Division, Romano was sentenced to
pay a ﬁne of $25 or to be imprisoned for ﬁve days. Although his em-
ployer bailed him out for a time, he surrendered him ﬁve days before
the trial, and Romano was imprisoned during that period.

THE Society’s Special Agent at Hamilton, Madison County, N. Y.,
arrested Orsino Beebe, a farmer ﬁfty-ﬁve years of age, for cruelty
to animals in keeping ﬁfteen head of cattle in a ﬁlthy stable, where
they were obliged to lie down in water two to three inches deep, and
where they were without proper food. Beebe was arraigned before
Justice Dayton F. Smith, of the Justice’s Court, Hamilton, who found
him guilty and sentenced him to pay a ﬁne of $15, with the alternative-
of ﬁfteen days’ in the County jail. The defendant paid the ﬁne. The

stables are now in repair, and it is learned that Beebe is feeding the
animals properly. '

FOR striking a horse severely in the face with his clenched ﬁst, Max
Goldstein, a Russian, nineteen years of age, and by profession an
expressman, was arrested on the Charge of cruelty to animals. Henry
Brenck, 0f the Twelfth Police Precinct, arraigned Goldstein before
City Magistrate Mathew P. Breen, of the Third District Court, who
held him in $100 bail to answer to the Court of Special Sessions. At
the trial before Justices McKe-an, Olmsted and Zeller, of the Court
of Special Sessions, First Division, the complaining witness testiﬁed
that the horse had just ﬁnished his mid-day meal when some oats
having dropped from his nose-bag to the ground, the animal at-
tempted to reach them as the defendant was trying to readjust the
horse’s bridle. Goldstein pulled up the horse’s head with a jerk
and Struck the poo-r creature severely on the nose. Goldstein pleaded
not guilty, denying having struck the horse. He was convicted on
the evidence, and was sentenced to pay a ﬁne of $10, with the alter-
native of three days in the city prison.

ASSISTED by the Society’s Special Agent from Yonkers, the Special
Agent at New Rochelle, N. Y., stopped the street parade of the Frank
A. Robbins circus. The Society had warned the circus management
that many of their horses were not in condition to be taken out. When
the parade reached Centre Avenue, shortly after noon, the two agents
stopped and examined all the horses. They found two horses, with
sores on their necks unprotected from the collar, hitched to the second
hand wagon; a team of horses, both with sore necks, were harnessed
to a car in which four of the circus women were being driven.
Several other horses hitched to the big animal cages. were in the same
condition. The agents turned the entire second division of the parade
out of the route to take it to Police Headquarters, and four of the
drivers were locked up.

IN mercifully preventing cruelty to animals, clemency is often more
effective than actual punishment. The case of Pasquale Senatore, who
waS-arrested for using a horse entirely unﬁt for any sort of labor,
shows that the man was not entirely to blame for the circumstances
under‘ which he forced the poor animal to work. Imprisoned for
three days, Senatore was ﬁnally tried before Justices Hinsdale, Wyatt
and Zeller, of the Court of Special Sessions, First Division. It
was learned that the prisoner was not only very poor, a stranger, and
unable to speak 'a word of English, but that he had a wife and four

HISTORY.

 

Prior to the enactment of the statute entitled “An Act to
Prevent the Cruel and Improper Treatment of Cattle,” intro-
duced in England in July, 1822, by the late highly esteemed
Mr. Martin, the general treatment of animals in all countries
of the world was inhuman.

*“Whether from ignorance, thoughtlessness, heedlessness,
or wanton brutality, animals were subjected to extreme pain
and torture, and their condition failed to excite the commiser-
ation of the public. The best classes of society contained a few
persons only who openly protested against this cruelty, while
the majority were engaged in divers pastimes that caused much
animal suffering, and regarded with scorn and indignation
any appeal made to them in favor of the brutes. Naturally, the
lower and lowest orders were therefore more or less insensible
to the claims of lower animals; taking cue as well as example
from their betters, they also indulged in cruel sports and main-
tained a right in man to behave toward dumb domestic de-
pendents as he pleased. In fact, the protests of humane people
were silenced by ridicule which came from the platform, the
pulpit, and the senate, as well as from the galled pens of sat-
irists.

“No better instance can be quoted of the prevailing indiffer-
ence of men in even the highest social position to the feelings
of animals than the mocking treatment of the Peers when
Lord Erskine stood up in the House of Lords, in the early

part of the present century (1811), to ask for justice to the
lower creatures of God. ‘ Insensible alike to his moderate de-
mands and appeals for compassion and mercy to all defenceless
animals that man had pressed into his service, the chamber
broke out into open derision when he argued in favor of their
rights to humane treatment. It is said that loud jeers, vulgar
ejaculations, indecorous demeanor, and even whistling and
cock—crowing were practically the only reply given to the grand
speech of this high—souled man. No wonder, therefore, that
the man in the street ridiculed also, and that callous coachmen
.and other persons vented their unrestrained passions on animals
without let or hindrance. The public records of eighty years
ago certainly do show that the friends of the brutes were few,
and their foes many and cruel. '

“The most reckless and savage punishment, and the most
disgusting disregard to the bodily sufferings of animals, were
exhibited unconcealed in the highways and streets daily; fester-
ing sores, discharging wounds, excruciating lameness, and tot-
tering inﬁrmity called not forth modern devices to evade public
reprobation, and without disguise the lash and goad worked
their bloody inﬂictions. The uncombined efforts of a few
benevolent individuals were no check to these evils; and hence
it became necessary to establish a society which should unite
the friends of dumb animal creatures.

“The founders of this Society met on the 16th of June, 1824,
and inaugurated the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, appointed a committee, and conceived the following
plan of operations: .

I. The circulation of suitable tracts gratuitously, or by cheap sale,
particularly among persons intrusted with cattle, such as coach-
men, carters, and drovers.

2. The introduction into schools of books calculated to impress on
youth the duty of humanity to inferior animals.

3. Frequent appeals to the public through the press, awakening more
general attention to a subject so interesting, though too much
neglected. ‘

 




 

101

4. The periodical delivery of discourses from the pulpit.

5. The employment of constables in the markets and streets; and

6. The prosecution of persons guilty of ﬂagrant acts of cruelty, with
publicity to the proceedings, and announcement of results.

“Steadily working by the above means, bravely bearing
contumely and overcoming difﬁculties, the founders became
stronger year after year: subscribers and co- —workers gradually
joined their ranks; and a marked improvement slowly mani-
fested itself 1n the treatment of animals. Then followed the
distinguished patronage of Her Most Gracious Majesty the
Queen, Her Royal Highness the late Duchess of Kent, the
Nobility, and many distinguished Members of both Houses of
Parliament; and in 1840, by command of Her Majesty, the
Society was honored with the preﬁx of ‘Royal.’ Since that
period its progress has been regular, and its achievements en-
couraging, and now it is regarded as a permanently estab-
lished institution, which has outlived ridicule, and secured for
its founders the esteem of good and practical men of this and
succeeding generations.

“During many years the committee advocated the removal
and enlargement of Smithﬁeld Market. Owing to its agency,
bull—baiting, bull-running, cock—ﬁghting, badger-baiting, and
other wicked sports of a barbarous age have been prohibited
by legal enactments. In 1835 the Society obtained an amend-
ment of Martin’s Act; in 1845 an amendment of the law for
regulating Knackers’ Yards; in 1849 a new and much im-
proved Act for the more effectual Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals; and in 1854 an Act prohibiting the use of dogs as
beasts of draft or burden throughout England; and recently
many other Acts of Parliament.”

The ﬁrst society organized in America for the protection of
animals was The American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, its founder and ﬁrst president being the
late Henry Bergh, to whose noble self-sacriﬁces and untiring
energies the cause of animal protection in this country owes

 

 

 

 

 

 




  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

102

its origin. The history of the Society, therefore, is practically
an account of the inception and development of the work of
animal protection in America.

In 1862 Mr. Bergh was appointed Secretary of Legation at
St Petersburg. While in Russia he found himself on several
occasions constrained to interfere in cases of atrocious cruelty,
and but for his ofﬁcial position he would have been exposed to
personal violence. His attention was thus directed to the sub-
ject of humanity to the brute creation, and while in London
on his way home in 1865, he made the acquaintance of John
Colam, Esq., Secretary of the Royal Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, who gave him much valuable informa-
tion concerning the operations of that Society in England.
On Mr. Bergh’s arrival at home, he found that no similar
society existed in this country, and he immediately devoted
himself to the establishment of a society for the United States.
At the outset the pr0position met with little encouragement,
and, without the assistance of the press, it might probably have
failed. On February 8, 1866, Mr. Bergh delivered a lecture in
Clinton Hall, in which he pleaded his cause with such force of
argument and such warmth of eloquent convictiOn, that ex-
pressions of sympathy and offers of assistance were freely
made by persons in attendance. The press then lent its pow-
erful aid; the lecture was published in whole or in part in all
the great cities of the country; public sentiment in favor of
Mr. Bergh’s movement was quickly aroused, and on April IO,
I866, “The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals” was incorporated by the Legislature of the State
of New York. Among the original charter members of the
Society were many of the most eminent citizens of the City
and State of New York.

On the 19th of April, in the same year, Mr. Bergh secured
the passage by the Legislature of New York of the ﬁrst law
ever enacted in this country for the protection of animals. It
provided that “every person who shall, by his act or neglect,
maliciously kill, maim, wound, injure, torture, or eruelly beat

 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

  

 




 

 

 

  

103

any horse, mule, cow, cattle, sheep, or other animal, belonging
to himself or another, shall, upon conviction, be adjudged
guilty of a misdemeanor.”

On the 22d of April a meeting was held in Clinton Hall for
the purpose of effecting a permanent organization, and at that
meeting the ﬁrst society for the protection of animals in this
country came into [active existence. The purpose of the as—
sociation, as set forth in its constitution, was “to provide ef—
fective means for the prevention of cruelty to animals through-
out the United States, to enforce all laws which then were or
might hereafter be enacted for the protection of animals, and
to secure, by lawful means, the arrest and conviction of all
persons found violating such laws.” As a matter of fact, the
only law of that kind then to be found on the statute books of
the States of the Union was that which had been passed by
the Legislature of New York nine days (after the. incorporation
of the Society. Within twelve months, however, another “act
for the more effectual prevention of cruelty to animals” was

passed by the Legislature of the same State; and from time to -

time additions have been made to it, so that there is now hardly
a phase of cruelty which the Society has not the legal power
to prevent within the boundaries of the State of New York.
The legal deﬁnition of the word “animal” now includes every
living creature except members of the human race, and the
words “torture” and “cruelty” include every act, omission, or
neglect whereby unjustiﬁable physical pain, suffering, or death
is caused or permitted.

ORGANIZATION or OTHER SOCIETIES-—PROGRESS or THE
WORK.

The organization and inﬂuence of The American Society
soon led to the establishment of local societies in all parts of
the Union and in other countries on the American Continent-
and elsewhere. The number of local societies incorporated in

 

 

  

 

 




 

    

 

    

105

menced the erection of a Shelter for Animals at 102d Street
and East River, provided with! every accommodation for the
care of animals and their humane destruction.

In rescuing the community from the reign of the old dog
catchers, the Society earned the gratitude of the dog owners
of New York, and in 1895, at the request of the Mayor of
Brooklyn, the law was amended (Chap. 412, Laws 1895) so as
to include that city as well. A Shelter was then established in
that city, at the corner of Malbone Street and Nostrand Avenue,
and when Staten Island became a part of the greater City of
New York, a Shelter was also opened on Wave Street, Staple—
ton, Borough of Richmond.

Much suffering has thus been spared the vagrant, lost, and
abandoned dogs and cats of the city. Unwanted animals are
no longer thrown into the streets, to suffer and die of expo-
sure and starvation, but are given into the care of the Society
and by it mercifully destroyed or placed in good homes.

Through the generosity of kind-hearted people interested in
the work of animal protection, the Society was enabled, in
1896-97, to rear a commodious ﬁreproof building as its perma-
nent Headquarters, adequate to the increased needs of the So-
ciety, and supplied with every facility for carrying on the work
to the best advantage.

Meanwhile the practical work is not neglected. The ofﬁcers
of the Society are clothed with ample police powers. They
wear a distinctive uniform and patrol the streets by day and
by night. They have full power to arrest and prosecute offend-
ers against the laws relating to animals. In addition to the
uniformed police, the Society has over two hundred special
agents in different parts of the State, clothed with the same

' authority and engaged in enforcing the laws for the prevention

of cruelty. In the Boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn the
Society has ambulances for the removal of injured, sick, and
disabled animals; appliances for the rescue of drowning ani- .
mals and animals which have fallen into excavations and a

patrol wagon which carries with it the necessary apparatus and

 

 

 

 

 




   
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

106

medicines for rendering aid to injured animals in the streets.

In addition to its permanent headquarters, Madison Avenue
and 26th Street, and the Shelters above mentioned, the Society
maintains an ambulance house at III East 22d Street,
New York, and an ofﬁce at I3 Willoughby Street, and an am—
bulance house at 114 Lawrence Street, Brooklyn. In the
greater City of New York it maintains a uniformed force of
twenty-two salaried Special Agents, and in other parts of the
State of New York it has over two hundred volunteer agents.

In the prosecution of its work, the Society has in constant .
use three large ambulances for the removal of disabled ani-
mals, and eight smaller ambulances, two tricycle carriers and
two motor ambulances especially constructed for the removal
of sick, injured and homeless small animals. A large corps
of men is employed in this service».

The ofﬁcial organ of the Society is OUR ANIMAL FRIENDS,
a monthly magazine which is devoted to the cause of human-
ity to all living creatures, and which has an extensive and
growing circulation.

AN APPEAL.

An erroneous idea is entertained by many that this Society
is beyond the necessity for further appeals to our benevolent
and generous-hearted people for aid. It receives no apprOpri-
ations from the city or State, and is dependent upon voluntary
subscriptions, donations, and bequests. The usefulness of the
organization could be largely increased, and the ﬁeld of its
labors greatly extended, if it had a more adequate pecuniary
support. As all know, the objects of the Society are to enforce
the humane laws, to investigate complaints, to care for lost or
abandoned animals, or to destroy them mercifully, to suppress
cruel beating, overloading, and over-driving, and to protect
and assist sick, maimed, and starving animals.

Another prominent object of the Society is the distribution
of humane literature, out of which shall grow not only the kind
treatment of animals, but the higher elevation of our own race.
It may be desirable to state in this connection that during the
past year the Society has published and distributed many mil-
lions of pages of printed matter in the interest of humanity to
animals, and we have had ample reason 'to know that the effect
has been fully as great as could have been reasonably hoped
for this purpose and to these ends we earnestly invite your
pecuniary assistance.

The library of the Society contains many valuable books
relating to the brute creation. Contributions of works treating
of animal life are urgently requested. The library is of great
importance and value to the Society in aiding it to carry on the
educational feature which now so largely enters into the work
of animal protection.

Contributions to the Society will be acknowledged in the
annual report.

Title XVI of the Penal Code, relating to cruelty to animals,
is also published by the Society in pamphlet form, and a copy
will be forwarded to any one interested in the work.

A booklet entitled “Blessed are the Merciful,” illustrating
and describing the work of the Society, past and present, will
be sent on request.

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

HOW TO PROCEED AGAINST
OFFENDERS.

 

There are two modes of proceeding, viz.: I. By giving the
offender into the custody of a policeman, constable, or other
officer. II. By the apprehension of the accused under a war-
rant.

I.

BY GIVING THE OFFENDER INTO THE CUSTODY OF AN OFFICER
AUTHORIZED To MAKE ARRESTS.

When you personally witness an act of cruelty, call the atten-
tion of an officer to the nature of the offense, insist on the arrest
of the offender; if you cannot accompany the accused to the
magistrate, then give your name and address to the officer as a
witness, and be sure to take his number, name, and precinct,
in order that you may compel attention to the case. The law
requires the police throughout this State to aid in the protec—
tion of dumb animals from injury and abuse; and should any
officer refuse his assistance—which is not likely to occur—
then take the number on his hat or shield, and report the same
to the Society.

II.
BY THE ARREST OF THE ACCUSED UNDER WARRANT.

When you do not personally see the act of cruelty, or when
you can not procure an ofﬁcer on the spot, or if the ofﬁcer

 
 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

123

refuses to act, then obtain the name and address of the Offender,
and that painted on the vehicle, if any, and the names and resi-

dences Of those who witnessed the act, and lay the facts before
a magistrate.

IN ALL CASES

Make a note Of the time when, and the street or place where,
the offense occurred, and also the names and residences Of all
persons present and Of any others who may be called as wit-
nesses. If the Offense was that Of driving a horse or other
animal with galled neck or shoulders, or other wounds, note
the size and location Of such wounds—especially if raw, dis-
charging, or in contact with the harness. If the offense was
ﬂogging or beating, note the instrument, the number of blows,
on what part Of the body inﬂicted, and the eﬁect, if any, on 'the
skin Of the animal; if overloading, carefully observe the symp—
toms Of distress, such as the trembling, falling, unusual perspi-
ration, or exhaustion. Report all cases Of mutilation, such as
docking tails Of horses, cutting tails or ears of dogs, or any
other torture; also cases Of cruelty in the transporting of sheep,
calves, game, fowls, or other poultry, or animals, while bound
by the legs or otherwise, in any part Of this State, either on land
or water. In every instance observe minutely and take down
in writing the facts and details, and also the language Of the
Offender at the time.

FINALLY.

Complaints or inquiries made to the Society at its head-
quarters, by night or by day, will receive prompt attention; and
ALL ARRESTS FOR CRUELTY SHOULD BE PROMPTLY REPORTED
THERE, TO INSURE A PROPER PROSECUTION OF THE CASE.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

STEEL GAS TANK FOR THE HUMANE
DESTRUCTION OF SMALL ANIMALS.

 
   
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
   
   

See Illustrations, page 40.

The dimensions of this tank are as follows: length, ten feet;
width, ﬁve feet, and height, four feet six inches. A trap—door
is provided through which the animals are put into the tank,
and four heavy plate-glass windows light the interior. Ordi-
nary illuminating gas is admitted through an inch and one-
quarter pipe, and when the tank is to be emptied escapes
through a six-inch pipe. As shown by the illustration on page
40, a truck or cage rests on the bottom of the tank on tracks, the
latter withdrawing. from the tank so that the cage can be moved
outside to facilitate the handling of the bodies of dead animals.

The method of destroying Small animals by illuminating gas
was adopted by the Society after a thorough investigation of
other known methods, and is to be recommended from humane
and sanitary standpoints. Illuminating gas produces anaethe-
sia or insensibility, and death. follows almost instantaneously
and is absolutely painless. Charcoal fumes cause asphyxia or
suffocation, and the use of charcoal is not recommended for
that reason.

MEMBERSHIP IN THE SOCIETY.

Attention is again called to the fact that this Society receives no funds from the public treasury, its revenues
being derived mainly from members’ dues, voluntary donations and bequests. The scope of the work could be
greatly extended if the Society had a larger ﬁxed income such as is derived from membership dues and interest
on permanent funds. An urgent appeal is therefore made for new members, and those who are already identiﬁed
with the cause of animal protection in this way are earnestly requested to interest their friendsin the work with
a view to having them become members of the Society. ‘

The laws of the State of New York provide as follows: “The police force of the City of New Yorh, as
well as of all other ﬁlaces where ﬂolice organizations exist, shall, as occasion may require, aid the Society,
its MEMBERS, or agents, in the enforcement of all laws which are now, or may hereafter be, enacted for
the protection of a’nmh animals.” -

Members are provided with a membership card and the emblematic button of the Society, which may be
shown as occasion requires. -

quests intended for the only true Henry Bergh Society.
Their whole cause was heard at length by a committee of the
State Senate, thirteen members of the committee being pres-
ent. Every allegation the applicants could bring against our
own Society was heard and disproved; every ground for the
claim that the proposed new Society should be intrusted with
the same functions as the society which has performed them
for now forty years, was set forth with great 'unction, and
was found wanting in the element of reality. The reSult of
the hearing was that the Committee came to the conclusion
that the old American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals was doing the work it had undertaken-to do; that
no new Society was needed, and that the proposed new Society
had shown no cause why its application should be granted.
When the vote was taken, these views were sustained by
eleven members of the Committee, only the introducer of the
bill and his colleague from an adjoining senatorial district,
voting for the applicants.

The last struggle in favor of pigeon shooting in the State
of New Jersey came to an end in June last. After every
trick had been vainly plied to prevent the passage of the bill
to abolish that barbarous and demoralizing sport, an attempt
was made by the Riverton Gun Club to obtain from the
courts, a decision that the law was unconstitutional. Accord—
ingly, a pigeon shooting match under the auspices of the
Club was advertised; two members were arrested and ﬁned,
and their appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which
maintained the constitutionality of the law, and so pigeon-
shooting in New Jersey received its last quietus.

In the National Legislature at Washington, constant care
is needed to prevent an odious amendment of SectiOn 4386
of the revised statutes of the United States, which has been
repeatedly introduced and is now for the third time pending
in the House of Representatives. The statute prOvides that
no cattle in transit shall be depriVed of food, water or rest for
more than twenty-eight hours at a time, and the amount

The followinq are a Few of the Cases Prosecuted
during the Year 1905.

THE Society’s Special Agent at New Rochelle, N. Y., accidentally dis-
covered an unfortunate little dog dying in the old St. Joseph’s cemetery
on Drake Avenue. Attracted by the muffled sound of the animal’s
cries, the agent was led to a clump of bushes where he found the dog,
a dachshund, tightly packed into a fruit box. The box cover was so
nailed down that the dog was a prisoner. James L. 'Reynolds was
written on the box. The neighbors told the agent that since early
morning a dog had been heard yelping, but that no one could make
out Where the creature was. Immediately on being set free the dog
tried to eat. from a spoon some of the milk offered him. It was,
however, too weak to take more than a mouthful or two. A care-
ful search was made at Reynolds’ market for the person who had
obtained the box at that place. Paro Vacaro, an Italian lad of
fourteen, was the offender. At Police Headquarters Vacaro stated
that a Mrs. Burns, of Spruce Street, had paid him to take away the
dog which was sick and useless. As the simplest means of disposing
of it, Vacaro had forced the dog into the box, had nailed it up and
put it in a secluded spot for the animal to die. Vacaro persisted in
his denial of any intentional wrongdoing. Arraigned before Justice
Edgar M. Phelps the lad was most severely reprimanded, but was
discharged with a warning of punishment should be come again be-
fore the Court on the charge of cruelty to animals.

THOMAS PELKEY, a horse trader, of Malone, N. Y., was arrested
for the serious offence of selling a horse diseased with glanders.
Arraigned before Justice Bruno, Pelkey .was sentenced to pay a ﬁne
of $7, or to be imprisoned for seven days. A veterinary surgeon
diagnosed the case of the horse as one of acute glanders, and the
animal had to be shot and buried as quickly as possible. The disease
is highly contagious alike to man and beast.

JOSEPH MAZZARELLA, an Italian, was arrested by a Special Agent of
the Society for beating a horse so severely that the whip had raised
as many as twenty-three welts on the animal’s body. The prisoner
was arraigned before City Magistrate John B. Mayo, of the First Dis-

 




 

33

children dependent on him. Through an interpreter the prisoner was
informed that if brought again before the Court on a similar charge
he would be severely punished. Sentence was then suspended.

FOR driving a horse that was sore, lame, and feeble, George Rosenthal
was arrested by a special agent of the Society and was held in $500
bail for trial at Special Sessions. The man’s employer, Charles
Schneekloth, it was found, had insisted on Rosenthal taking the horse
out, although Rosenthal had protested against using it in its wretched
condition. Schneekloth, however, ordered the driver “to go ahead
anddrive the horse,” With the alternative of losing his job. When
the driver was arrested his employer failed to bail him out or in any
way to communicate with- or to help him, so the unfortunate fellow
was imprisoned until the time of the trial. Two days after his arrest
he pleaded guilty and was remanded to the next day for sentence,
when sentence was suspended and Schneekloth, as the owner of the
horse, having ordered Rosenthal to drive the animal, was arrested and
was tried before the Court of Special Sessions, First Division, Justices
Hinsdale, Wyatt and Zeller presiding. The defendant pleaded not
guilty, but he admitted he owned the horse, that he was the employer
of the witness, George Rosenthal ; that he was present when Rosenthal
took the hourse out, and that he knew the horse had a sore on its back.
He insisted, however, that the sore back was fully protected from
contact with the saddle. As Rosenthal’s testimony could not be cor-
roborated, it failed to convict the defendant who was then acquitted.
There is little doubt that Schneekloth will dare ever repeat the offence.

WILLIAM FAGER was arrested by a Special Ofﬁcer of the Society
while driving a horse with two raw sores on its right shoulder measur—
ing, respectively, 2x3 inches and 1x1 inches, and unproteCted from
pressure by the collar. Fager was taken to the Fiftieth Police Pre-
cinct and was then arraigned before City Magistrate E. J. Dooley, of
the First District Court, who held him in $300 bail. Justices Falker,
Keady and Fleming, of the Court of Special Sessions, Second Division,

sentenced the prisoner to pay a ﬁne of $25, with the alternative of ten
days in jail.

the United States is now 244 and in other American nations
26 societies have been established and incorporated since 1866, .
making a total of 270.

The prevention of cruelty to animals has been the beginning
of many other humane organizations. Thus, in 1874, the So-
ciety appeared as prosecutor in a case of cruelty to children,
and it then appeared to be advisable to organize a separate
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. This was
done in 1875, under the Presidency of Mr. John D. Wright;
Mr. Henry Bergh becoming Vice-President of the new so—
ciety, the ﬁrst of its kind in the world, which has done so

much and such effectively good work in the last thirty-one
years. ~ ,
The establishment of these and other organizations has rep-

resented an increased interest in humane work which has
found a practical expression in the legislation of nearly every
State in the Union. At this date there is not a single State in
which cruelty of any kind is not forbidden by the law, under
stringent penalties for disobedience. Some defects continue
to exist, of course; but, speaking broadly, it may be said that
the laws on this subject are good. What is now required is
that the great mass of the peOple shall be educated into sym-
pathy with the humanity of the law. That is now the greatest
work of the Society, and it has constant reason to be grateful
for the assistance and encouragement which it receives from
the press, the pulpit, and the judges of the courts. I

The abuses growing out of the then prevailing systems of
dog catching and impounding having become so ﬂagrant as
to demand immediate checking, a bill, entitled “An Act for
the better protection of lost and strayed animals, and for se-
curing the rights of the owners thereof,” was prepared by the
President of the Society and introduced into the Legislature
of 1894, pro‘Viding for the abolishment of the city dog pound,
and empowering the Society to carryout the provisions of
the act. This bill became a law on March 8, 1894 (Chap. 115,
Laws 1894), and the Society immediately thereupon com-

vided; unless more than seventeen members are present, in which
case such removal shall be by a majority vote.

3. The Board of Managers shall be convened by the Secretary
when so directed by the President, or a Vice-President, or three
members of the Board. A written or printed notice of the time

6. The Board of Managers shall have the management, investment,
control, and disposition of the affairs, property and funds of the

time, as they accrue, be deposited by the Treasurer.

7. It may from time to time determine the salary or pecuniary com-
pensation of all ofﬁcers, agents, and employees of the Society.
