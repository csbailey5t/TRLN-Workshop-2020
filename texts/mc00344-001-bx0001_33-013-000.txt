Dear Sir:

In March, I ordered 30 copies of your booklet entitled "Basic
Care of Experimental Animals". These are for use in our train-
ing program for training veterinary technicians to work in
research laboratories. I got a notice that an order was forth—
coming, but I have yet to receive it. We are in need of these
booklets for use at the end of July as well as the last week

in August. Please send as soon as possible. Since we will

need 25/year, 100 copies might be more economical than yearly
shipments.
