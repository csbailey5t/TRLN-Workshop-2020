“(Ebrist €ruciﬁeb”

Now ere I slept, my prayer had been that I might'
see my way

To do the will of Christ, our Lord and Master, day
by day;

And with this prayer upon my lips, I know not that
I dreamed,

But suddenly the world of night a pandemonium
seemed. -

From forest, and from slaughter house, from bull
ring, and from stall,

There rose an anguished cry of pain, a loud, appeal-

. ing call;

As man—the dumb beasts’next of kin—with gun,
and whip, and knife,

Wer t pleasure- seeking through the earth, blood— bent
on taking life.

‘ From trap, and cage, and house, and zoo, and street,

that awful strain ,

Of tortured creatures rose and swelled the orchestra
of pain.

And then methought the gentle Christ appeared to
me, and spoke:

“I called you, but ye answered not”——and in my fear
I woke.

And when I woke, the air was rife with that sweet,
rhythmic din

Which tells the world that Christ has come to save
mankind from sin.

And through the open door of church and temple
passed a throng,

To WiOI'S hip Him with bended knee, with sermon,
and with song. ,

But over all I heard the cry of hunted,

mangled things;
. Those creatures which are part of God,
though they have hoofs and wings.
And then 'I bowed my head in shame, and in contri-
tion cried——
“Lo, after nineteen hundred years, Christ
still is Crucified.”
