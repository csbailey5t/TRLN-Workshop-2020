Twelve gates there are in Heaven’s
wall,

Round the City clear as glass,
And every gate is made of pearl,

Through which the white souls
pass.

But there’s another humble gate,
A wicket green and low,

That leads to wide and pleasant ﬁelds,
Where long cool grasses grow.

Apostles stand at the gates of pearl,
But by this wicket green,

He Who doth save both man and
beast,

The Lord Himself is seen.

 

He calls His creatures to come in,
And opens the wicket wide,

And the poor things, when they hear
His voice,

Flock through to the other side.

Tired horses and mangy cats,
And poor lost dogs are there,

And little birds once cramped and
caged,

Come singing through the air.

Fair is the City of golden streets.
With the gates of pearl flung wide,

But let us come to that wicket green,
And stand by the Master’s side.

 

 

 




THE Picture and the Poem of the Green Wicket were published last

Christmas in the December number of the “ P.D.S.A. News.” So
numerous have been the requests for copies of the Picture and Poem
that it may be that our Subscribers would like to see them ; especially
at Christmas time ; a Season so closely connected with Animals.

With the Birth of the Child in the Stable a new Era dawned for the
Animals. But only dawned : their Day has yet to come. '

The Lord of Life has implanted within the heart of some men and women ..
on earth the love to care for His helpless dumb ones ; to ease their pain, ;
to redress their wrongs : to bring happiness and freedom into their lives. ,,

This is the work the P.D.S.A. is trying to do.

It may be that this Christmas-tide your thoughts may dwell on the
signiﬁcant fact that the Child was born among the Animals, and that
His love is ever stretching forth to help them during their earthly
pilgrimage—and Beyond.

Surely a great inspiring thought for all whose compassion for suffering ‘

includes the Animals.
