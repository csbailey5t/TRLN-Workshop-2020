To Save the Birds means to Save the Farmer’s Crops.
FEED THE BIRDS IN COLD WEATHER.

Millions of dollars are lost to agriculture every year through harmful insects.
We need the birds to prevent their increase. Birds also destroy seeds of weeds,
act as scavengers, and in winter eat the eggs and grubs of insects.

In Rhode Island the Commissioners of Birds have requested that persons who
are kindly disposed toward birds place food in their usual haunts. With their
regular supply cut off by the unusual fall of snow, the birds are now in great danger
of extermination by starvation. A small supply of grain, or even the sweepings
from haymows, will do much to relieve the distress of birds during the snowy season.
Save your crumbs for them.
