Regional Representatives of the Canada~Wide Science
Fair approved new regulations May 23,1975 which
eliminate the use of veitebrate animals 161 science fair
projects unless these projects are purely observations of
normal living patterns of animals in the wild or in zoos or
of normal activities of pets or other (lonmsti: animals.

The decision followed several years' attempts to
control cruel experiments for science fairs by rules
against those which caused harm to 111111117; vertebrates.
Despite such rules, some students continued to conduct
projects that caused animal. suffering. The Regional
Representatives, therefore, drew up the iollowino re911la-

to Dr. Scln-veitzer himself in Oslo, Norway in 1954. Since then,
this annual award has gone to men and women who, because
of their compassion for all the creatures of this earth, have made
an outstanding contribution to animal welfare. The recipients

animals. To this distinguished list, today, we add the name of
Miss Yolzo lv‘luto. .

"Miss Muto started to worl-a for the Japan Animal VJelfare
Society in 1970, and for the past 8 years, has applied herself
diligently and unselfishly to her chosen field. She has been
singled out for her compassion and willingness to go that extra
mile to help animals, in whatever way she can. The record
shows that Miss Muto thought nothing of working on holidays
and weelzcnds to ensure that the animals were fed and that she.
invariably did all she could to see that they were as comfortable
as possible. Of course, these are but a few of the reasons why
she was selected to receive this award. The many reasons can
perhaps be best summed up by the inscription on the medal,
which reads: ‘We need a boundless ethics which include the
animals also.’ Because she has talrcn these words to heart, l am
pleased to present this medal to Miss Yolro Muto.”

A PERSPECTIVE on one NATION’S EFFORTS
TO PREVENT E t'rrncrron OF SPECIES

by Tom Garrett

The Pleistocene epoch, beginning about three million years
ago, produced the greatest flowering of the age of mammals.
Sixty thousand years ago, however, in Africa, there occurred the
first of a series of wholesale extinctions. About 40 percent of the
larger mammals on the continent becameextinct within a few
thousand years. . - . .

In Eur‘Ope, from 30,000 to about 10,000 years ago a similar
wave of extinction carried to oblivion about half of the larger
mammals: Merck’s rhino and the wooly rhino, the mammoth
and the straight tuslter, the steppe bison and the Irish elk to
name a few. ' ' ' ;

Then, in North America, with the end of the great Wiscono
sonian glaciation, 1013,000 years ago, there occurred an epio
sode of catastrophic mass death that swept from the earth 70
percent of the genera of large North American mammals: the
American mastodon, the giant beaver, the giant ground sloths,
new world camels and horses, the dire wolf, Felts atrox the
plains lion. ’ .

The sudden mass extinctions, affecting in'most cases the
largest and the strongest mammals, adapted to climatic vicis-
situdes and free of natural enemies, occurred in each case with
the emergence or inwzsion of advanced human hunting cul-
tures. All evidence points to these lrun‘ing cultures as the
major and probably the sole agent of c:-:tin:tt:.»n. . ‘

As human hunting cu tures reached South America there
passed, along with the glyptodonts and the giant armadillo,
the last ground sloths and the last new world hor:es. T re arrival
of human hunting cultures in Australia resulted in the extinction

of 40 percent of the larger marsupials, including Diprotodont, a
wornbat the size of a rhino. .

The human invasion of l‘-’iadagascar a thousand years ago
resulted in the extinction of about 40 percent of the species of
lemurs, including h’regaladapus who was as large or larger than
a gorilla and all of the other large diurnal lemurs; a pigmy hippo,
a giant fossa, and the elephant bird which nested in great
numbers on the coastal plains, and whose eggs-the largest
known from any bird———may still be found. With the colonization
of New Zealand by the Maori about 800 AD there passed from
existence 2?. species of, moas, giant ground birds which had

assumed the terrestrial niche normally occupied by mammals.

Of this order, only the little kiwi, which survived by its insignifi—

cance and fossorial habits, is extant today.

It would appear, following the extinction of the more vulner-
able species, that pre-civilized hunting cultures may have come
into a libration with their environments l‘lowevet, with the
advent of civilization there was unleashed against the already
impoverished postpleistocene fauna. a new and more terrible
and implacable assault, compressed in time, concentrated in
ferocity. A .

In 300 years, an evolutionary flick of an eyelash, an entire
suborder of unique and magnificent rnarnrna s, the great baleen
whales, have been brought within sight of biological extinction
by human whalcrs. Most of this has occurred within our
lifetimes. \Vithin a century, our forefathers destroyed the vast
flights of the p: ssenger pigeon. ln half a century, following the
extinction of the eastern bison, the plains bison was pushed as a
deliberate policy of the US military bent on subjugating Indians
to the lip of the abyss of extinction. \Uithln 20 years from its first
encounter with humans, the Stoller sea cow was extinct.

lt was through the efforts ofa small group of Americans led
by Dr. William l'lornaday at the close of the last century, that the
plains bison was spared extinction. Since that time there has
been what a modem media type might call a "spreading back-
lash" against the destruction of species. The l‘lational llison
ltm'ige was (’fdiilill‘dtt'tl in 1908. The Audubon Sot'lety, along
with the rvdonbtable Dr. llornnday who set up VJauhlngton,

EXTINCTION OF SPECIES

[continued from page. 1]

the millinery industry. lixccss killing of most game. birds and
animals was gradually curbed, and depleted poriutations
restored.

This trend in the. United States was matched by trends in
other nations. The restoration of the pronghorn in the western

S in the 1920's and 1930's, for example, found its counterpart
in the restoration during the same period of the Saiga antelope
on the Soviet steppes.

Twelve years ago, after authorizing various pieces of legisla-
tion to succor individual species such as a 1958 bill to restore
the Hawaiian goose, or Nene, this committee reported out our
nation's first “across the board" legislation to protect endan-

- gered species. it has twice strengthened this legislation. The En-

dangered Species Act of 1973 is one of the strongest and most
comprehensive pieces of wildlife legislation ever Written.
‘ Since The Convention on international Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was negotiated under the
mandate of the 1969 Act no less than forty-six nations have
joined the United States in passing legislation to protect en~
dangered species, and are now parties to the international
convention. An increased recognition of the gravity of the plight
of endangered wildlife appears to be seeping into the aware
ness of numerous governments.

Despite these seeming successes, the past decade has beyond
doubt been the most disastrous in the history of the planet. The
next promises to be worse. There may well be more extinctions
in the next 30 years than in the last 30,000. '

Today, not only individual species, but the fauna and flora of
entire regions are subject to destruction, indeed are being
destroyed, implacably, often irrevocably, by deforestation, de—
sertification, laterization, erosion, urbanization, not over a course
of centuries, but year by year, at a terrifying rate.

in a few more years, if the present trend continues, practically
all of the unique fauna of Madagascar, including the 28
remaining species of lemurs, and most of the native flora will be
gone forever. Even greater disasters a e gathering in southeast
Asia and in Amazonia. '

Direct‘pressure on wildlife is everywhere mounting, reaching
a state of organized extermination in parts of Africa, and to a
lesser extent southeast Asia and northern South America. Ani—
mals such as the Black Rhinoceros or Grevy’s Zebra, which
seemed secure a few years ago, are in imminent danger of
extinction through poaching.

it is a striking fact that during a time when wildlife numbers
are plur‘nrneting worldwide, the importation of wildlife products
into this country, and the use of domestic wildlife products, is
increasing dramatically. imports of items manufactured from
wildlife increased from 1.7 million in 1972to 91. million in 1976.
Imports of skins and hides rose from 930,000 in 1973 to 32.5
million. Cametrophy imports rose from 2800" in 19.73 to
34,000. in these sameyears the status of crocodilians through-
out: the world, and of sea turtles throughout the world has
become desperate.

Just as the amounts imported have. soared, the prices com-
manded by many such products have mounted astronomically.
The price of ivory has increased at least ten fold since 1970.
Prices paid for Grcvy’s zebra hides increased from $150.00 in
1972 to $2000.00 in .977 on the New York market. it is little
wonder that this zebra faces extinction along with Hartman's
mountain and Cape mountain zebras.

l'inforcernent, to succeed, must rise con‘in‘iensmately to the
traffic it is forced to regulate, not to remain static in the face of
vastly increased traffic. Forther, if we are to [)i‘CUCI‘if extirpation
of species, rather than react too late as is probably the case with
the zebras mentioned, we must. routinely ban the importation of
- entire classes of products: all ivory, all zebra skins, all crocodilian
'sltins, all turtle products.

A minor illustration of the quality of tire enforcement of the
Act may be found in the fact that tortoise shell from hawlzsbill
turtles, listed as endangered since 1970, was being exported
Openly to Japan in 1976, from l-"ucrto l'iico, sold openly in San
Juan and even advertised in “Que l’asa," the official tourist
guide to the island. 5

The. case of the llm'ida inanatee is equally tragic. This animal
is well known and well lifted by the public and has been
designated the. Honda State anin'ial, yet amid tail: of j‘n'ifitecting
it and in the face of a clear legal obligation to protect it under
two federal laws, the manatee remains without protection
against the major sources of human caused mortality. The

are‘largely preventable. ' "

Nothing has been done by the Department of interior to aid
the animal, and almost nothing has been done by the state. Last
year there were four “enforcement actions" by interior, no
arrests, no convictions. One such action, in fact, consisted in
blowing a dead manatee which had been mistaken for a floating
mine. -

it is at this juncture, with so much dependent upon the United
Statesactivating its all but stillborn "endangered species program,
that the Act has come under the most determined attack in the
Congress. The Senate amendment, passed July 19, is aimed at
Section 7 which has been characterized as the “heart” of the

Act. . '

The first part 01 Section 7 imposes a pesitive duty on US
Agencies to use existing programs to carry out purposes of the
Act, and to carry out “conservation programs" in consultation
with the Secretary.

'The second portion of Section 7 departs from past wildlife
law which simply regulated trade and taking, by acknowledging
that no species can or does exist in isolation, and that it is
perfectly academic whether or not an animal is deliberately
molested if its habitat is destroyed.

. The obscure species which have figured in several recent

controversies, are of course, part and parcel of very specific

environments. Their disappearance, almost invariably, signals

the functional end of the habitat in which they live in whatever

region, in whatever river system comprised their range. Their

disappearance signals the end perhaps of free flowing, unpol-

luted water on a river, the end of inland marshes in a region.

The end of the snail darter, for example, would mean the end of.

any large, free flowing stretch of river in the entire Tennessee

system, the end of a running water fishery, the end of 17,000

acres of prime bottom farmland and additional thousands of

acres of forest and pasture. it would mean the end of the bond

that humans had with that land before it was wrenched forcibly

from them, including severance ties of the Cherokee people

with ancestral sites. There would be far, far more that is
absolutely irreplaceable and unique ending forever, foreclosed
forever, than the little snail darter.

Most of the potential controversies which are now simmering
under Section 7 ihvolve not obscure species, but birds and
mammals well ltnown and cherished by the. public. These
involve, among others, grizzly bears, Asian elephants, Southern
sea otters, Whooping cranes, Florida evcrglades lattes, Bach-
man's warblers, Mississippi sand hill cranes, Florida rnéuratees,
Bowhead whales, l.-ay:.:au Monk seals.

The Senate amendment applies to these species as much as
to the snail darier. The interests pushing for amendment no
more care what happens to these species than they care what
happens to the snail clatter.

Most of the Conflicts involving these species are doubtless
resolvable if the Agencies malte good faith efforts to consult and
to modify their projects and activities. it is hard to imagine,
l’iowever, that most of the Agencies would pass up an oppor-
tunity to shunt the decision to a committee where political pres- .
sures from vested interests can be focused.

The present act se. 3 forth a firm national policy to prevent t
extinction of species, and makes it clear that no agency is
exempt from the requirements of that policy. if the Senate
amendment becomes law, we will then have an Act that
protects endangered species only wl‘ien they don’t get in the
way of ”progress.” -

were removed, then some animals also had a gland removed
from the. base of their brain. Finally all these animals received
pieces of tumor tat-zen from the. testicles of donors and trans—
planted into the recipient animals' eyes. The student found
rapid growth in some eye tumors. Conclusions were drawn
regarding the influence of certain sex hormones on these
tumors.

Cover Photograph: The Schweitzer Medal is awarded annually by the
Animal Welfare Institute in honor of Dr. Albert Schweitzer, the great
doctor whose philosophy of Reverence for Life is expressed in his
words quoted on the face of the medal: ‘e‘We need a boundless ethics
which will include the animals aiso.” Dr. Schweitzer and his dog
“Tchu-tchu” are portrayed on the medal.

 

DR. SCHWEITZER’S MESSAGE TO
THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

 

I am profoundly moved that you would like to give my name to the
medal you have created. I give you this right with all my heart. I would
never have believed that my philosophy, which incorporates in our
ethics a compassionate attitude toward all creatures, would be noticed
and recognized in my lifetime. I knew this truth would impose itself
one day on human thought, but it is the great and moving surprise of
my life that I should still be able to witness this progress of ethics.

Your medal celebrates this progress: philosophy obliged to inter—
vene for animals when up till now it has shown so little interest in
them.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

I like to define biology as the history of the earth and all its life—past, present, and
future. To understand biology is to understand that all life is linked to the earth from which
it came; it is to understand the stream of life, ﬂowing out of the dim past into the uncertain
future, is in reality a unified force, though composed of an infinite number and variety of
separate lives. The essence of life is lived in freedom. Any concept of biology is not only
sterile and profitless, it is distorted and untrue if it puts its primary focus on unnatural
conditions rather than on those vast forces not of man’s making, that shape and channel
the nature and direction of life.

To the extent that it is ever necessary to put certain questions to nature by placing
unnatural restraints upon living creatures or by subjecting them to unnatural conditions or
to changes in their bodily structure, this is a task for the mature scientist. It is essential that
the beginning student should first become acquainted with the true meaning of his subject
through observing the lives of creatures in their true relation to each other and to their
environment. To begin by asking him to observe artificial conditions is to create in his
mind distorted conceptions and to thwart the development of his natural emotional
response to the mysteries of the life stream of which he is a part. Only as a child’s aware-

ness and reverence for the wholeness of life are developed can his humanity to his own

kind reach its full development.

INTRODUCTION

The first edition of “Humane Biology Projects” was prepared by the Animal Welfare Institute
in 1960 on the advice of humane scientists who were deeply concerned by evidence that
substantial numbers of high school students were being encouraged to perform experiments
involving surgery or stress on live animals in their schools and even at home, in improvised
laboratories. To discourage such cruelty sample projects were written by researchers and
teachers to help other educators to develop in high school students original thinking, painstaking
observation, understanding of scientific procedures and respect for the rights and feelings of all
forms of life that possess sensibility.

The third edition has been carefully revised throughout and new sections have been added,
notably “You as a Guardian of the Environment,” and “You as the Subject of Study,” to
encourage beneficent current trends in biology teaching.

It still remains necessary to emphasize that students below college level are not yet prepared
to undertake animal experimentation; crude experiments, unproductive of scientific results, are
demoralizing to students who should rather be learning responsibility to treat both domestic and
wild animals with humanity and kindness. Dr. Chauncey Leake, former Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, who was among the
first to express his views, wrote, “It seems to me that it is wise to avoid getting our youngsters so
enthused over biological sciences that they are anxious to undertake extensive animal
experimentation without the background, the experience, the judgment, or the wisdom that is
necessary in handling animals appropriately for complicated biological experimentation. In other
words, I think we had better continue to learn the hard way: there is plenty of biology to be
gotten from a study of unicellular organisms that can be readily obtained in any high school
laboratory and handled and followed with skill and convenience. We are apt to get into trouble
using animals.”

Canada recognized this fact in 1975 when, after several years of attempting to enforce rules
against science fair projects which caused harm to living vertebrates, the regional representatives
of the Canada-wide Science Fair approved regulations eliminating the use of vertebrate animals
for science fair projects unless these projects are purely observations of normal living patterns of
animals in the wild or zoos or of normal activities of pets or other domestic animals. The Animal
Welfare Institute believes that high school science teachers in all countries should follow these
well-conceived rules, listed on the next page:

 




 

REGULATION FOR ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION IN SCIENCE FAIRS

Biological experimentation is essential for an understanding of living processes. Such studies
should lead to a respect for all living things. Capable students anxious to pursue a career in
biological sciences must receive the necessary encouragement and direction. It is important that
all aspects of the project be within the comprehension, and capabilities of the student
undertaking the study. -

If experiments are to be conducted on living subjects for Science Fair projects then only lower
orders of life may be used. Lower orders such as bacteria, fungi, protozoa and insects can reveal
much basic biological information.

Vertebrate animals are not to be used in experiments for projects for Science Fairs, with the
following exceptions:
a) Observations of normal living patterns of wild animals, in the free living state, or in zoological
parks, gardens or aquaria.
b) Observations of normal living patterns of pets, fish or domestic animals.

No living vertebrate animal shall be displayed in exhibits in Science Fairs.

Cells such as red blood cells, other tissue cells, plasma or serum or anatomical specimens such
as organs, tissues or skeletons purchased or acquired from biological supply houses or research
facilities may be used in Science Fair projects. Observational type studies, on only chicken egg
embryos, may be used in Science Fair projects. If normal egg embryos are to be hatched,
satisfactory humane considerations must be made for disposal of chicks. If such arrangements
cannot be made then the chicken embryos must be destroyed on the 19th day of incubation. No
eggs capable of hatching may be exhibited in Science Fairs.

Experiments involving the human animal shall conform with these regulations as they apply
to other animals. Normal physiological and behavioral studies may be carried out. Projects
must be carefully selected so that neither physiological nor psychological harm can result from
the study.

All experiments shall be carried out under the supervision of a competent science teacher. It
shall be the responsibility of the qualified science teacher to ensure the student has the necessary
comprehension for the study to be undertaken. Whenever possible, specifically qualified experts
in the field should be consulted.

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

YOU AS A GUARDIAN OF NATURE

 

FIGHTING DETERIORATION
OF THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT

. THROUGH MECHANICAL DESTRUCTION
AND POLLUTION AT SEA, ON LAND

AND IN THE AIR

Protecting Endangered and Threatened
Species; Helping Ecosystems in Trouble

Science and technology have recently been
applied in such a way as to cause the most rapid
changes the Earth has ever undergone. Even
beginning students of science need a basic grasp of
what is happening so that they can contribute,
whether as scientists or non-scientists, to maintaining
our planet as the rich and varied biological marvel
that it is and preventing it from becoming a poverty
stricken waste land in a dead sea.

Direct observation, accurately recorded, is es-
sential to this task. Depending on their geographic
location, students can undertake any one of myriad
possible projects some of which appear on pages
1 1-20 in this manual, involving observation of water,
land and air and the animals and plants that inhabit
and use them. Students should write up their
observations and recommend action. Some sug-
gested projects appear below followed by quotations
from leading observer—activists, in science and
government.

How to Obtain Recent Laws

Clip articles from newspapers that report on
events affecting the environment. Classify and file
them, or make a scrapbook. Follow up by writing for
further information. For example, to obtain a copy of
a recently passed state law, write to the Secretary of
State in the capital of your state. Enclose a
self—addressed envelope or label when you write for
information.

The Member of Congress representing your
District may be able to help you obtain information
on federal laws and regulations. Write to him or her
at the House Office Building, Washington, DC.
20515.

To read federal laws affecting wildlife ask your
school librarian to obtain a copy of “A Compilation
of Federal Laws Relating to Conservation and De-
velopment of Our Nation’s Fish and Wildlife Re-
sources, Environmental Quality and Ocean-
ography”, January, 1975, for sale by the Superin-
tendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC. 20402.

Water and Air Quality

Ask the agency of your local city or county
government in charge of the environment to give

you information on water and air quality in your
area. Is the quality improving? deteriorating? How is
it measured?

Make a graph showing the air quality index in
your area during the course of the year. When is the
index lowest (air relatively unpolluted)? highest (air
badly polluted)? What is being done in your com-
munity about purity of air and water? Can you make
any observations of the effects of air and water
pollution on native animal and plant life? Are
admissions to local hospitals higher on days of heavy
poHuﬁon?

Pesticides

Are pesticides and herbicides used by your lOcal
government? What substances are used? How are
they controlled? Write to the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington, DC,
20460, for information on registration of pesticides.
Write to the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living
Environment, 8940 Jones Mill Road, Washington,
DC. 20015, for information on non-chemical means
of controlling insects when there are too many of
one species.

Write to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service of the US. Department of Agriculture for
information on control of the screw worm fly by
production of sterile male flies. Ask for information
on predaceous insects as alternatives to toxic
chemicals in controlling insects that eat crops. Do
you think enough effort has been put into these
types of biological control? Who decides which
federal projects receive most attention and funds?

Wildlife

Do you live near the ocean? a lake? a river? a
stream? a pond? a marsh? Try to find out whether
there are more or fewer wild mammals, birds,
reptiles, amphibians, fish, mollusks and arthropods in
or near this water now or thirty years ago. Are there
more or fewer species represented? What species
have disappeared? For example, are bluebirds' and
orioles present in your part of the country? Were
they present in the past? When? Have some species
disappeared temporarily, then reappeared? Why?
Check laws and regulations governing uses of
wetlands, coastal zones, farmlands, forests. Try to
analyze the benefits and drawbacks of different kinds
of land use.

NEPA

Try to learn about the effect of the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in your area. If an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has ”been

 

 




 

 

prepared for a local project write to the agency
concerned for a copy. What scientific expertise was
required to prepare the EIS? Do you agree with the
conclusions? Ask your school librarian to obtain a
copy of “Environmental Impact Statements, An
Analysis of Six Years Experience by Seventy Federal
Agencies, Report of the Council on Environmental
Quality. March, 1976.”

Enlist Others

List activities each person can take part in or avoid
to help protect nature; list collective activities (e.g. re-
cycling of paper, glass, metal; energy conservation by
avoiding excessive air conditioning, heating, driving;
picking up throwaways in which wild animals and
birds may become entangled or trapped; growing
plants and trees beneficial to wildlife; avoiding waste
of food and water; avoiding use of pesticides and
other pollutants; avoiding purchase of exotic pets
shipped from foreign countries with great loss of life;
speaking up in defense of animals and unexploited
natural areas; gathering information on threats to the
environment; helping to disseminate such informa-
tion; asking for government actions; following up on
actions taken. What are the most important?
Prepare an exhibit on personal involvement in
guarding the integrity of the ecosystem.

Select a particular current question of environ-
mental concern and try to learn all you can about it.
Research it in one or more libraries, by seeking
information through the mail or by interviews.

Where possible, make your own observations in the
field. Take photographs to record your findings.
Write a carefully documented report, giving
references. Submit your report to the appropriate
authorities and to one or more organizations
concerned with the environment generally, or with
animals. (See listing, page 00.)

The Sea

[Excerpts from testimony by Captain Jacques-
Yves Cousteau before the California Legislature,
March 10, 1975, reprinted by permission]

Diving constantly, since 1936, in the waters of the
Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, the
North and South Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, in“ the
Arctic as well as in the Antarctic, our growing team of
underwater explorers has observed a constant
deterioration of the sea water, and a substantial
reduction in the abundance of marine life. A rough
estimate is that the overall fish population of the
world has decreased at least 30 percent in the last 20
years.

The deterioration of the Oceans is due at least as
much to mechanical destruction, such as overfishing,
detrimental fishing methods, explosions, careless
coastal and harbor developments, landfills, and so
on, as it is due to pollution (which is a word often
used inadequately).

Pollution can be due to degradable products, such
as manure or most organic compounds, or to per—
manent toxic chemicals, such as heavy metals, some

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

pesticides, or extra long-lived radioactive material
that just pile up in the ocean where they can find
practically no outlet. As far as degradables are
concerned, the Oceans under the influence of
bacteria, solar radiation, etc., have certain powers of
self-purification, to an extent that is still poorly under-
stood and needs considerably more research. It is
thus conceivable to allow a given quantity of such
temporary pollution on the basis of geographical and
oceanographical factors. On the contrary, for
permanent toxic chemicals the only acceptable level
in the long run is ZERO.

The main cause of peril to the Oceans is: Human
ignorance about the Sea. Astronomy, for instance, is
more than 3000 years old, but oceanography less
than 100! On land, hunting was replaced by farming
as the main source of food more than 10,000 years
ago! In the Sea, apart from oysters and, recently,
shrimp, we are behaving like barbarian hunters, and
all the more with the help of the latest technology.

Aviation is new, but is well regulated by air traffic
control; navigation, although as old as civilization,
knows, still today, no maritime control and more
than one million tons of ships are lost every year.
Law helps regulate human activities, except on the
high seas, that is still today an “outlaw country”
where the only rule is “catch as catch can!”

We speak stupidly of the “vastness of the
Oceans,” when the entire biosphere on earth is an
extremely thin and vulnerable layer, and yet if the
oceans are big at a human scale, the critical zones
where all the productivity and the reproduction
processes take place are minuscule areas in the Sea.

We still think of the Sea as another world,
populated by weird or’fierce animals (a weakness of
our education exploited recently by such films as
“Jaws”) when in fact, there is a striking unity of life
above and under the surface of the Oceans, a simi-
liarity of motivation and behavior, and an
indefectible dependence of all forms of life, including
ours, upon the quality and vitality of our planet’s
water system.

The overall cost to the nation of performing suf-
ficient purification of urban and industrial effluents
(in most cases this involves practically tertiary
treatment of all wastes) would be astronomical, and
much higher than avoiding pollution at the source.
We must decide to prevent instead of curing. Zero
level of toxic products in all industrial effluents must
be enforced at the factory where outgoing water
should be good enough to serve at the cafeteria. The
cost of such purification should be shared between
the responsible industry and public funds. As far as
urban wastes are concerned, severe regulations con-
cerning all domestic products, including detergents
and pesticides, could turn them into biodegradable
effluents, and by dispersing these waste waters in
large areas of the Sea, it would be possible never to
pass the limit of the Ocean’s self-cleaning
possibilities.

Selling shells and bleached pieces of coral should
be prohibited, to stop the destruction of hundreds of

 

miles of beautiful reefs by divers using crowbars.
Selling tropical fish, for home saltwater aquariums,
also should be prohibited, as most saltwater fish do
not reproduce in captivity and can only be supplied
by depleting entire reef populations: for one fish sold,
more than ten die during capture or transportation.
Spearfishing with or withour scuba gear should be
totally prohibited, as well as collecting lobsters, crabs
or gorgonians by hand.

The human being, as an individual, is farsighted
and capable of improvising solutions and sacrifices if
that is the price for his survival. But as a social
animal, he often acts with no more judgment than
the extinct dinosaurs. Our individual consciousness
is no longer capable of coping with the problems of
the planet. We must develop a new global conscious-
ness to motivate us to make the necessary sacrifices
without delay.

What Price Pollution?

[Excerpt from an address by Captain Cousteau to
the Remote Sensing Symposium, University of
Michigan,_October 7, 1975, reprinted by permission]

Recently I was invited to participate in the
National Energy Conference in Beverly Hills. One of
the topics was a ‘cost-benefit’ study of the Santa
Barbara disaster. Every single damage was evaluated
in dollars and cents, to prove that the benefits from
careless offshore drilling outweighed the cost of the
accident. But the nonsense of the system when it is
pushed to its extreme, exploded when it came to put
a price-tag on life: How much the cost of a bird? One
dollar! One dollar is the price poachers get for a
squirrel! How much for an extinct species? How
much for the blue whale? Are we going to put a
price—tag to my 3 year old granddaughter? What
savings would justify the sacrifice of future
generations ?

Endangered Species

Scientists throughout the world report to the
Survival Service Commission of the International
Union for the Conservation of Nature on the status
of dwindling animal species. The Red Data Book
constantly updates what is known of species rated as
vulnerable, threatened or endangered.

The United States is the world leader in seeking
protection and restoration of these species through
the Endangered Species Act, the Lacey Act, and the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered
and Threatened Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
signed in Washington after three weeks of meetings
by delegates from 92 nations in 1973.

In a statement to these delegates Russell Train,
former Administrator of our nation’s Environmental
Protection Agency, said in part: “Trade in products
of animals has been a major factor in past extermin-
ations and present endangerment. Some species of
little importance in the live-animal trade are en-
dangered almost solely because of the demand for

 




 

 

their products. This is as true today for the great
trade in crocodile hides as it was during the last
century for trade in bird feathers.

“Consider, for example, three endangered species
which have been proposed for protection under this
convention. The figures speak for themselves. In
1969, prior to enforcement of specific national con-
trols, the United States imported the whole raw hides
of 7,934 leopards, 1,885 cheetahs, and 113,069
ocelots. These incredible figures are a shocking
indictment of man’s greed—and woman’s vanity.
The figures, with the present status of these species,
testify eloquently to the need for this convention and
to the absolutely essential requirement that the
convention cover products as well as live specimens.

“But control of the trade in live specimens is no
less imperative. Few people are aware of the
tremendous volume of trade in live animals for the
pet trade, zoos, and medical research. In 1971 the
United States imported 103,500 live mammals,
995,000 live birds, 391,000 live amphibians,
1,404,200 live reptiles, and 98,971,000 live fish. It
should be clear to all that the stocks of many wild
species simply cannot continue to meet this
enormous demand, and it has already led to the
near-extinction of many species. In 1970 over 550
cats of species now proposed for appendix I of this
convention were imported live into the United
States. These included cheetahs, snow leopards,
tiger cats, margays, and ocelots. In the same year
2,397 primates representing eight species on the
proposed appendix I were imported, including 150

 

golden lion marmosets—a total roughly equal to the
present estimated total wild population. One can
only feel a sense of outrage at such statistics. They
represent a truly black page in mankind’s history.
And while I have made reference to figures for my
country, proportional volumes of such imports can
be found for most other consumer countries.”

Captain Cousteau states, “at least 1200 species of
plants and animals have been eradicated by man in
the past 75 years and thousands of others are
seriously threatened.” The rate of extinction of
species has risen dramatically. Records of mammal
extinction for the past 2,000 years show that over
half occurred within the last 60 years.

Dr. Lee Talbot, SeniorlScientist of the Council on
Environmental Quality, established to advise the
President of the United States on the environment,
has written: “During the past 150 years, the rate of
extermination of mammals has increased 55-fold. If
[these] exterminations continue to increase at that
rate, in about 30 years all the remaining 4,062
species of mammals will be gone.”

Students can take active part in campaigning to
save endangered species from extinction through
letter-writing and boycott activities. By familiarizing
themselves with existing laws for the protection and
conservation of wildlife and the ecosystems on
which animal and plant life are dependent, students
will find points of particular interest to them and
initiate projects on their own.

young people is the Explorer Post #950 at the
Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary, Redington Shores,
Florida, 33708, where an outstanding rescue opera-
tion for sick and injured birds has been developed.
Here interested students are guided in exploring
different careers in wildlife sciences or ecology.

The students are given an opportunity to assist in
the work of the sanctuary, helping to nurse the birds
back to health. They periodically go out with super-
visors responding to citizens’ calls about birds in
distress.

Groups like this one are valuable in developing
understanding and compassion for wildlife.

Listed at the end of this manual are books, laws,
agencies and organizations to which students may
wish to make reference.

Scientists as Activists

An early example of scientists who became
activists in the protection of wild birds is detailed in
The Gulls: A Social History by Frank Graham, Jr.
(Random House, New York, 1975). It tells of the
gruesome fashion which swept the world in the late
19th century for wearing stuffed birds.

“The public’s demand for the plumage of wild
birds became almost insatiable. Women attended
social functions in gowns looped with blackbirds or
shopped and strolled under hats that bristled with
egrets’ plumes. A typical 19th century social note
observed that ‘Miss — looked extremely well in
white with a whole nest of sparkling, scintillating
birds in her hair which would have puzzled an
ornithologist to clarify.’

“It is true that only an ornithologist of formidable
learning was able to appreciate the variety to be
found among the milliners’ creations on two strolls
through Manhattan’s shopping districts in 1896.
Frank M. Chapman of the American Museum of
Natural History counted with a bird watcher’s zeal
542 hats which were decorated with plumage of
some kind. He recognized 40 different species,
including Wilson’s warblers, pileated woodpeckers,
Arcadian owls, bluebirds, pine grosbeaks and a
northern shrike or butcherbird.

“A reaction finally set in against the slaughter. It
surfaced first among a small group of professionals
who had become concerned about the future of
American birds. In 1883 these naturalists all of
whom were identified with New England, wrote to a
number of their colleagues proposing the creation of
an organization to promote the advancement of
American ornithology...while the American Or-
nithologist’s Union promoted the study of ornith-
ology in this country, it also helped to preserve the
creatures its members proposed to study. Its Bird
Protection Committee assembled reports on the
status of various birds, concluding that at least
5,000,000 were killed every year for the millinery
trade. . .

“Founders of the American Ornithglogist’s Union
were Joel A. Allen and William Brewster of Harvard

 

and Elliott Cones of Columbia University in
Washington. The scientists were joined by laymen
and William Dutcher led the work in framing a
model state law for bird protection which Graham
characterizes as perhaps the AOU’s most lasting
contribution to conservation. When a bill was
introduced in Congress in 1898 to prohibit the
importation of millinery plumes as well as the sale or
shipment of them within the United States, the
MILLINERY TRADE REVIEW called on dealers to
crush ‘this most iniquitous and childish measure.’

“Dutcher knew that ultimately only strong legisla-
tion would save the many species of birds being
killed for their plumage. Early in 1900 the lobbying
he and his colleagues had done bore fruit in
Washington. Congress passed the Lacey Act which
gave bird protection an enormous lift on the national
level. Sponsored by Representative John F. Lacey of
Iowa, the law prohibited interstate traffic in birds
killed in violation of state laws.”

The law also prohibits importation into the United
States of any animal or part or product from an
animal taken in violation of the laws of that nation.
This concept played an important role in formulating
the International Convention on Trade in En-
dangered or Threatened Fauna and Flora 73 years
after its enactment.

Victor Scheffer, first Chairman of the Marine
Mammal Commission (1972-1976) created by the
Federal Marine Mammal Protection Act, began his
career as a biologist with the Fish and Wildlife
Service. In his most recent book A Voice for Wildlife
(Charles Scribner’s Sons, New York, 1974) he
wrote:

“Of all the motives, the educational is perhaps the
most central today, for in the process of learning
about wildlife people begin to think about ecology,
the wasting of natural resources, vanishing species,
the proper uses of wild environments, and ultimately
the conservation of man himself.”

Later in the book he says:

“It is important to realize that wildlife management
in the United States is by no means a smooth-
running operation. On the contrary, tremendously
powerful interests are working to-day against the
welfare of wild animals, and they are interests on
which conventional management has had little
influence. Wildlife managers do not operate in a
laboratory with colleagues of their own choosing;
they are thrown in with politicians, corporate agri-
culturists, and industrialists of many stripes and
colors, some of whom put gross national product
ahead of gross national good. More acres of America
are covered by pavement than by wilderness. The
multi-billion-dollar petroleum industry is moving into
operations that threaten to foul the wildlife habitats
of Alaska and the inshore waters of the Pacific coast.
With some exceptions, American wildlife exists
today not because of management but in spite of it.
The variety and abundance of wildlife are dependent
on man’s decision of land use.”

 




 

 

you AS THE SUBJECT OF STUDY

 

BIOLOGY STUDENTS AS
EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS
By F. Barbara Orlans, Ph. D.

Most high-school biology courses either neglect or
omit the study of man as a physiological entity. Is it
not more forceful and of more direct value for a
student to learn as much as possible by direct study
of himself? A wide range of educationally sound ex-
periments can be selected which conform with rules
published at the end of this chapter which guarantee
that neither physical nor psychological harm will be-
fall the subject. Following are some suggested
projects.

VISION

Eye Dominance

Most people have a pronounced proclivity to use
one eye more than the other. However, few people
know that they do so.

To determine eye dominance, the subject, using
both eyes, sights a distant object through a 2.5-cm
hole in the center of a cardboard sheet held at arm’s
length. The cardboard must be held with both hands
and moved gradually toward the face, keeping the
distant object sighted (fig. 1). Determine which eye is
used (Gregg 1966).

Repeat each test several times. Is the same eye

 

Fig. 1. Eye dominance. Student sights a distant
object through a hole in a card held at arm’s length,
then slowly brings the card toward her face. At a
certain point she becomes aware that she is using
only one eye—the dominant eye.

Mammals by F. Barbara Olans, Ph.D. Published by Addison-
Wesley. 1977. Reprinted from The American Biology Teacher,

always used to keep the object in sight? Is the sub—
ject’s dominant eye on the same side as his
dominant hand and the dominant food-chewing side
of mouth? Make a record of eye, hand, and side-of-
mouth dominance for a group of, say, 20 people;
does a consistent pattern emerge?

Depth Perception

A study of depth perception can be made with just
a large sheet of white cardboard (60 cm, by 90 cm)
and a strip of black paper about 1 cm wide and 30
cm long. The instructor acts as experimenter. Prop
the large cardboard about 5 m in front of the class
several feet from the front of the room, with the top
of the cardboard about 10 cm above the eye level of
the subjects.
Trial 1: Hold the black paper 10 cm behind the large
card, with about 5 cm showing above the card. Sub-
jects are to judge and record the distance between
the large card and the black strip under four
conditions: (i) looking with one eye while holding
head still; (ii) looking with one eye while moving
head back and forth; (iii) looking with both eyes
while holding head still; and (iv) looking with both
eyes while moving head back and forth.

Trial 2: Repeat the above procedure with the strip
30 cm from the card.

Trial 3: Repeat at 20 cm.

Trial 4: Repeat at 2.5 cm.

Next, repeat trials 1-4, but use a pencil instead of
the black strip. Hold the pencil so that 5 cm of it
shows above the card, and use the same distances
but change their order.

Each subject records his judgments (16 for the
black strip and 16 for the pencil trials). After the trials
are completed, the subjects are told the actual
distances and asked to compute their errors. The
average error for the whole class can also be
computed. Which conditions produced the poorest
judgments? Which produced the best? What depth
cues were available to the subject under each of the
viewing conditions? Were there any differences be-
tween accuracies of judgment for the black card and
for the pencil? Why?

Localization of Sound

Accuracy in locating sounds can be determined by
blindfolding the subject and clinking two coins
together (or by using a snapper “cricket”) at varying
points approximately 1 m from the subject’s head
(fig. 2). The subject is asked to point in the direction
he thinks the sound is coming from. A score of
correct or incorrect is recorded for 30 trials with each
subject. What individual variation is found in the
ability to locate sounds? Can training improve this
ability? Do musically talented students, who have

from. Another student records correct and incorrect

responses.

received training in listening carefully to sounds,
score better than average in this test?

Judging Weights

What are the limits of man’s ability to judge
whether two objects are of different weights? The
subject closes his eyes and holds two 125-ml Erlen—
meyer flasks by the neck—one in each hand (fig. 3).
One flask is marked “Test,” the other “Control”; and

each initially contains 50 g of water (1 g = 1 ml).

The subject reports to the experimenter if he thinks
the weights are equal. The experimenter then adds
water to the test flask in 2-ml portions, each time
handing the flasks back to the subject but randomly
mixing the right and the left and each time asking the
subject to determine relative weights. When the test
flask feels just perceptibly heavier, record the volume
of water added. The difference in weight between
the test flask and the control flask at this point is the
“difference threshold” for 50 g. Repeat this pro-
cedure, starting with 100, 200, and 500 g of water
(and using larger flasks as needed). How fine a
discrimination can be made in judging weights? Does
the difference threshold vary according to the initial
weights used? Make a graph, plotting the difference
threshold on the vertical axis against the weight of
the control flash on the horizontal axis. Do the results
vary much from person to person?

Mapping Sweat Glands

Map the sweat glands on the palm of the subject’s
hand by painting 2.5 cm of the skin with 1% iodine
solution (McBlair 1965) (fig. 4). Allow the skin to dry
completely. Then hold a 2.5-cm square of bond

paper on it for 30 seconds while resting quietly.
Remove the paper and count the number of bluish
dots in 1 cm . Each bluish dot represents one active
sweat gland. Record the result. Repeat for the palm
of the left hand, the sole of a foot, the back of the
neck, and an underarm. Repeat under conditions of
light exercise and after sitting in a cold room. What
conclusions can be drawn as to the distribution and
activity of sweat glands?

Muscular Fatigue

Muscle fatigue can be tested by continuously
opening and closing the hand rapidly and forcefully.
Record the number of times this is done in 20
seconds. Repeat this 10 times and record the
number of closures per trial. Graph the results by
plotting the number of closures against the number
of trials. To demonstrate the importance of good
blood-circulation for muscular activity, repeat this
experiment with a constriction band on the arm, to
block off the venous return.

Heart Rate: a Study in Physiological
Variation

The range of individual variation in any
population has important implications for physicians
in determining the presence of abnormal signs: one
cannot know what is abnormal unless one knows
what is normal. An important health sign is the
rapidity or slowness of the heartbeat—the heart rate

 

Fig. 3. Judging weights. The subject (center), with

eyes closed, holds two flasks of water—a test flask

and a controlflask—and judges which is the heavier.
Another student (right) has just added 2 ml of water
to the test flask. Successive aliquots are added to this
flask until the subject senses a difference in its weight
from that of the control flask, which remains
unchanged. A third student (left) acts as recorder.

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

The extent of individual variation in heartbeat is,
therefore, of considerable importance. Heartbeat can
be gauged from the pulse either in the wrist or in the
carotid artery (in the neck). Determine the heart (rate
for many individuals. Count the number of beats per
minute with the aid of a stopwatch. Make several
determinations for each individual. Plot the
distribution curve by graphing the frequency
(number of individuals in the sample) on the vertical
axis against the heartbeats per unit time on the
horizontal axis. The standard deviation and other
statistical properties can be determined if the sample
is large enough (Hake et al. 1971).

Performance after Eating a Good Breakfast

Elicit the reaction time, decision-making ability,
and work capacity of a group of students who have
regularly omitted breakfast for four weeks; then have
them eat a good breakfast and retest them for these
values. A simple standard psychological test that
could be used is the time taken to sort a deck of
cards into suits and rank. Alternatively, determine
simple and choice reaction times (see below) for
subjects acting as their own controls; or use other
students as controls by comparing these times for
students who regularly omit breakfast with those
who regularly eat breakfast. The results may prove
comparable to recent professional findings that
made use of a variety of tests: when breakfast was
omitted, students took longer to make decisions, had
less neuromuscular control, and did less work.

NERVOUS SYSTEM

Reaction Time

To demonstrate the time lag between stimulus and
response (reaction time), the subject holds the thumb
and forefinger of his preferred hand about 1 cm
apart while the experimenter suspends a relatively
new dollar bill vertically between them, with the
center of the bill level with the thumb and finger. The
subject is told to grasp the bill as soon as the
experimenter releases it. Most subjects are unable to
do this.

A variation requires the subject to hold a measur-
ing stick (meter stick, ruler) between his thumb and
index finger; he releases his grip and then, as quickly
as possible, tries to grasp the stick again. Measure the
distance the stick travels before it is stopped. Several
trials should be made. The average distance the stick
falls is a measure of reaction time. Compare the
results of trials with several subjects.

Have the subject repeat the test after chilling his
hands in icewater. What effect does this have on the
results? Why?

Simple and Choice Reaction Times

To demonstrate the differences between a simple
and a choice reaction time, have 10 students line up

in a single column, with each person placing his left
hand on the shoulder of the person in front of him
(fig. 5). The first person raises his arm so that it can
be readily seen. The subjects are told that each
person will be tapped on the shoulder and that he is
to respond as quickly as possible after he receives
the signal. The instructor taps the left shoulder of the
last person and starts a stopwatch at the same time,
stopping it as soon as the head man drops his arm.
After some practice runs, time 10 trials. Average the
results and compute the mean time taken for each
person to respond. This is the simple reaction time.

To measure choice reaction time, each subject
places both hands on the shoulders of the person
next in line. This time the subjects are to respond by
tapping the shoulder opposite the one that received
the stimulus; but the location of the stimulus will be
unknown in advance and will vary from trial to trial.
Make 10 trials and compare the results with those
obtained for simple reaction times.

 

Fig. 4. Simple reaction time. 10 students are lined up;
each has placed his left hand on the left shoulder of
the person in front. The person at the head of the
line holds up his left hand, ready to start the test (see
text), while the teacher (right) stands by with a stop
watch.

Which reaction time is faster? What are the neural
explanations for the differences in the two situations?
Give examples of the improvement of efficiency in
industrial or other work through organizing the task
in such a manner as to reduce the frequency of
choice-reaction times. 7

Human Error

A salutary experiment devised to test a person’s
ability to observe accurately is to assess the errors
made in simple counting. Ask all the students to
open their textbooks to a particular page and count
the number of words on that page in a specified
length of time. (Tell them that a hyphenated word
counts as one word.) Have each student write down
his answer on a piece of paper. Collect the results;
discard deliberate attempts to confound the data;
and make a frequency distribution graph of the rest

 




 

of the responses. Usually, there is an enormous
range in responses.

Finger Mazes: Plotting a Learning Curve

A learning curve is a graph showing the relation
between time and the ability to complete a task
accurately. It reveals the speed with which a subject
has learned a task. One suitable task is to learn a
finger maze.

Relativity of Taste

Can a particular food affect your taste buds so
that the next thing you eat or drink tastes different
than usual?

Boil one or more artichokes. Ask each person in
the class to: 1) take a sip of tap water, tasting it
carefully, 2) take a bite of artichoke, tasting it, 3) take
a second sip of water. Ask each person to record any
difference he may perceive in the taste of water
before and after eating the artichoke. What taste do
most individuals name? How many report a
difference in the taste of the water?

HUMANE CRITERIA

No study should ever be undertaken by any high
school student which could possibly cause pain, dis-
tress, discomfort, or any other unpleasant feeling to
another person. The Animal Welfare Institute has
stood steadfastly opposed to the infliction of any
suffering on animals by high school science students.
It is, of course, adamantly opposed to hurting or
embarrassing other people for the sake of a science
fair project.

The following rules, prepared by Dr. Orlans in
consultation with other scientists, are presented here
because it has come to our attention that in some
high school projects insensitivity of the feelings of
others had led to improper experiments. The Animal
Welfare Institute, therefore, urges the teacher to
carefully check these rules to make certain that no
projects are begun which could possibly be harmful
or unpleasant to any individual taking part in them
and that any such project started without the
teacher’s knowledge is immediately stopped.

GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF HUMAN
PARTICIPANTS IN EXPERIMENTS CON-
DUCTED BY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

1) All student projects must be meaningfully
supervised by a qualified adult.

After consulting the relevant literature, the student
shall write a detailed plan for the proposed project
which includes a description of how the rights of the
human participants will be protected. This plan shall
be approved by a qualified adult supervisor and the
school authorities prior to the commencement of
experimental work. The supervisor shall meaning-
fully oversee the conduct of the experiment until its
conclusion.

2) Procedures must not harm participants
physically or mentally.

High school students shall undertake no
procedures involving human participants that could
result in physical or mental harm to the participant.
These include, among others, procedures involving
physical pain (such as electric shock), undue physical
stress (such as overexertion), administration of harm—
ful substances (such as drugs), the induction of
anxiety or embarrassment, the use of any deception
or pressure on the participant. Research areas in
which some topics could cause mental distress
include, but are not limited to, sex, religion, family re-

 




 

 

 

lations, questions of paternity, physical appearance
(body weight, height, skin appearance, attractive-
ness, etc), achievement level, and peer acceptance.
As a general rule, experimental projects in these
areas by high school students should be avoided.

3. Agreement to participate must be obtainedfrom
all participants.

The individual conducting the project (the experi-
menter), must obtain each participant’s agreement to
participate, based on a full understanding of what
that agreement implies. Obtaining agreement
involves providing a full explanation of the
experimental procedures with special emphasis on
aspects of the project likely to affect willingness to
participate. All questions asked by any prospective
participant must be answered.

Even though the procedures will involve no harm,
nevertheless, participants who are too young or for
other reasons cannot comprehend the project
should be excluded, or consent should be obtained
from their parents or guardians. A clear and fair
agreement must exist between the experimenter and
the participant that clarifies the responsibilities of
both. All promises and commitments included in that
agreement must be honored by the experimenter.

4. Participants must have the right to refuse to
participate.

Potential research participants have the right to
refuse to participate and the right to withdraw from

10

participation at any time during the course of the
experimental procedures. The person conducting
the project must explain this right to all potential
participants prior to the commencement of the ex-
periment.

Protection of this right requires special vigilance
when the experimenter is in a position of influence
(such as being in a higher grade), than the
participant. Persons who decline to participate in a
particular experiment should not be publicly
identified. Under no circumstances should potential
participants be pressured.

5. Undesirable consequences must be removed.

In the event that a project does result in any unan-
ticipated undesirable consequences for a participant
or any other person, the experimenter has the re-
sponsibility to detect and remove these conse-
quences and to halt the project if it is still in progress.

6. The anonymity of the information gathered
must be preserved.

In certain projects, a participant may not wish the
experimenter to disclose the results of the study in a
way that individually identifies that participant. This
can be achieved simply by not writing down the
participant’s name when the data is being collected.
Only with the participant’s full agreement can the
experimenter disclose identifiable information about
that participant to any other individual.

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION

 

ECOLOGY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL
By Lee R. Dice

(Reprinted with modifications from “Opportunity for
Investigation in Natural History by High-School
Teachers,” University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor.)

The best introduction to biology is through natural
history and the essence of natural history is ecology.
Every young person is interested in living plants and
mammals, and wishes to know not only their names

but also their habits. Part of the past failure in
teaching biology in the high schools, is the teacher’s
attempt to present the same materials which he or
she studied in college courses.

The teaching of natural history is more difficult
than the teaching of anatomy or physiology. To
teach natural history properly, the teacher must first
be able to identify the common plants and animals of
the locality. Little information about habits and
habitats can be given unless the names of the plants
and animals are known. To rely upon textbooks

describing the natural history of other regions will be
a disappointment; it is more important that the
student become acquainted with the ecology of the
local flora and fauna.

After the student has learned to identify the
common plants and animals of the region, the next
step is to learn about their habits and ecological rela-
tionships (to distinguish between green plants and
parasites—between herbivores and carnivores). A
view of the complex interrelationships within a biotic
community leads to a consideration of the human
being’s place within this community and a regard for
the interdependence of all living organisms.

Many high school teachers are enthusiastic
botanists and ornithologists demonstrating their
ability and energy. Manuals for the classification of
flowering plants and birds are available, but this
cannot be said of other kinds of plants and animals.
Manuals for the identification of mammals, reptiles,
fishes, mollusks, insects, spiders and other kinds of
animals are unavailable except for scattered local
areas. We do not know enough yet about the
characters of the various species of most groups of
animals to prepare manuals. High school teachers
could serve in the preparation of manuals by
gathering data and making identifications with
museum specialists. At the same time, they would
learn the plants and animals of their neighborhoods.

The habits and ecology of plants and animals are
less known than their names. It is difficult to find any
valuable information concerning the behavior of a
local species of animals and then surprising to realize
that some of one’s discoveries about local natural
history cannot be found in any published work.
Information about the ecological interrelationships of
plants and animals is lacking for most regions. We
know very little about the number of plants or
animals of one species which can live satisfactorily
on a given acre of land. We know little about the
habitat limitations of either plants or animals. We
know very little about the cycles of abundance which
many animals exhibit, such as the presumed seven—
year cycle of the snowshoe hare. When one kind of
animal becomes abundant, it comes into competition
for food and space with numerous other species;
when it becomes rare, the carnivores which fed upon
it may starve to death.

More facts about all of these ecological relation-
ships are greatly needed. Here is a field in which high
school students of biology can serve science as well
as themselves. Many high schools are in regions in
which the natural history is still little known. For no
region is the natural history completely worked out.
Almost anyone could observe for a week the
behavior of any common animal and discover a new
important fact! Some of the things which the teacher
uncovers while preparing for class or teaching will be
new to science and should be reported to the proper
scientific society.

Of course, no one can know equally well all of the

12

plants and animals of any region. Nor can one make
equally valuable contributions to the natural history
of many diverse groups. Specialization on particular
plants and animals is necessary, but a broad
familiarity with all of the common forms of life is
desirable. There is so much variability in the behavior
of all organisms that it pays to repeat observations
carefully to avoid drawing too general a conclusion
from some abnormality of behavior.

The teacher who knows the natural history of his
or her locality is certain to be a better biology teacher.
The students will secure an understanding of the
interrelationships between living plants and animals
which will help them to be responsible participants.
Learning should be enhanced by focusing on the
immediate environment—that which can be ex-
perienced sensorially day 'in and day out. What
could be more interesting or relevant than what is
just out-of—doors? Those who continue to study
biology in college will have a better foundation for
advanced courses.

STATISTICS IN BIOLOGICAL STUDIES
By Marjorie Anchel, Ph. D.
New York Botanical Garden

The use of statistics is well illustrated in ecological
studies, and for the mathematically inclined, it would
be instructive to consult the references on statistics
given here, or other elementary treatments of the
subject (perhaps the best to begin with is Warren
Weaver’s “Lady Luck”). The methods might then be
applied in evaluating the results of the observations
made.

A biologist should understand the concepts of
chance, significance and probability in the statistical
sense. The use of statistics enables the biologist to
evaluate his results, so as to determine, for example,
the probability that an apparent difference between
two groups is real, or alternatively, that it is due only
to chance. It also enables him to design experiments
so that he can extract the maximum information
from the minimum number of subjects. The
importance of such design is very well expressed by
CW. Hume, in “Man and Beast”: In talking about
unplanned or poorly planned experiments, he says:
“So long as the worst that happens is that large
quantities of expensive chemicals are poured down
the drain, nobody need worry except the man who
pays for the chemicals;” “...in experiments on
animals ethical requirements demand even more
strongly than does scientific virtuosity, that an
experimenter should not be content with pedestrian
empiricism but should plan his experiments in the
light of a great deal of preliminary hard thinking.”
One requirement is that he should “consult a
statistician if he is not sure of his design being
maximally efficient.” This advice applies to all
scientists, and is a principle that should become part
of their thinking at the very beginning of their

 

 




 

 

scientific training. Because very few can be specialists
in more than one field, it is important to know when
to collaborate with those in other fields.

Plant Ecology Studies

In “Botanical Fieldwork in a Suburb”, B.E. Bayliss
writes: “Field ecology provides an excellent
opportunity for training in methods of scientific in-
vestigation and preparation of the observed results
for presentation and, since each field project carried
out is indeed a piece of original research, a class is
perhaps more satisfactorily imbued with the spirit of
scientific discovery by a field project than by some
routine experiment in the laboratory.”

School playing fields, weedy garden beds, nearby
building sites, and public parks are among the
suggested places to carry out these studies.

1) Transects. Record the plants occurring along
a line and within a fixed distance along the line.
Draw simple pictures of the plants occurring on the
line. Where several similar species (e.g., grasses)
occur in the transect, colors may be used to show the
different species in the drawing.

Example: Six students might take a transect
starting under trees and running into the open for
100 or 150 feet. Plants occurring every four inches
along the line might be identified and recorded. Light
intensity might be measured with a photo-electric ex-
posure meter at intervals to find the connection
between variations in plant growth and light
intensity. Soil along the transect might be measured
for acidity and amount of water present. Diagrams of
the transect may be made, the vertical scale about
four times greater than the horizontal scale. Each
pair of students may be made responsible for one
part of the transect and for the pictorial representa-
tion and the three sheets joined together for exhibit
at the end.

Similar transects can be made in any area offering
differences in. vegetation, for example: grass which is
mown regularly, and edges near a fence which grow
taller and are not reached by the mower; spots which
have good and bad soil drainage, variation in soil
depth, unequal applications of fertilizer, weed killer
or other application, or unequal wear by walking.

2) Belt transects. Belt transects a foot or more
wide may be laid down between two trees and a
count made of seeds. or fruits which have fallen.
Such results may be shOwn pictorially or may be
analyzed statistically.

3) Statistical analysis. To make a valence
analysis of vegetation in a reasonably uniform area,
such as a lawn, 25 random samples in a square foot
will provide adequate sampling. Attach a string 61/2
inches long to two pegs ormeat skewers. Push one
peg into the ground at a point in the area under
study, chosen at random. Rotate the other, giving the
name of each species as it occurs. Fill the notebook

Adaptation to Environment

How do different forms of life adapt to their
environment? This is a vast question which offers
many possible projects in providing partial answers
to it.

For example, what are the adaptations to pond
life, to a fast flowing stream, to the seashore, as
demonstrated in plants and animals ranging from
simple unicellular forms through different types of
worms, mollusks, crustaceans and other arthropods,
fishes, amphibians, birds and mammals?

Ecological studies showing the interdependence
and relationship between the different forms in each
environmental situation would be of very great
interest.

For example, which wading birds are found near
ponds in your part Of the country? Near streams?
Why do sandy beaches support flocks of sandpipers
and plovers while herons and bitterns prefer still
waters? Which species of fish are adapted to life in
both salt and fresh water? Why can’t most forms of
water—living animals and plants shift from salt to fresh
water?

FIG. 4.

A good Science Fair project would be the study,
by careful Observation, of the habits of the different
living things in one selected area. Such an area could
be a clearing in a wood, a piece of uncultivated
ground, a patch of weeds, a wood pile, the edge of a
lake or pond, a corner of the school yard or a park.
The requirements of each species might be shown; in
the case of plants, the conditions of soil, water, and
light; in the case of animals, the food, resting or
hiding place, activities at different times Of day or Of
season. The relationship between the plants and the
animals insofar as it can be discovered should be
described. Unanswered questions might also be
noted in such a project, to show the extent to which
knowledge in this area is lacking.

For more advanced studies in comparative care of
the young, observations in nature are of great
interest. A reading of Tinbergen, Lorenz, Eckstein
and others (see Pages ) will give ideas for
observations of birds insects in natural
surroundings.

Life History Projects

The detailed life history of a chosen animal or
plant can provide an almost unlimited field for
original scientific work whose length in time is

, determined by the life cycle of the form of life

studied. Opportunities abound for orignal observa-

tions and records in the form of accurate description,
statistical data, photographs or drawings of the
subject under different conditions. Observations
should be made on structure, habitat, adaptations
and way of life.

In city schools, plants which will grow indoors or
insects which can be maintained in an environment
sufficiently similar to natural conditions are the most
advantageous forms of life to study. The metamor-
phosis of caterpillar to butterfly is a classic example.

In suburban and rural schools, interesting studies
can be made of insects, amphibians, reptiles, birds
and mammals in nature. The fascinating observa-
tions of wasps by Dr. Niko Tinbergen described in
“Curious Naturalists” (Garden City, N.J.: Natural
History Library, 1968) offer ideas for ways to
observe individual insects in their natural sur-
roundings.

For example, after watching each wasp returning
to her nest without hesitation or difficulty in locating
the small hole in the sand that was its entrance, Dr.
Tinbergen changed the location of sticks, leaves,
stones or other small landmarks near the hole to see
if this would confuse the wasp. He tried this with a
number of different individuals. In each case the
wasp showed confusion when she arrived near her

16

nest, hovering and hunting for the entrance, taking
as long as twenty-five minutes to reach the hole that
she had always found so easily before. When she
found it, she went in, and when she emerged ready
for another hunting trip, she hovered over the area
for about two minutes, circling repeatedly to learn
the new appearance. The next time she returned,
she found the entrance to the burrow again almost
without hesitation. Theories of insect learning may
be tested by simple experiments such as the above,
and supplemented with reading of books such as
those listed on Pages 54-55.

The life history of a chosen plant may be
portrayed for a Science Fair in the form of preserved
specimens of the plant at different stages in its
development showing it 1) as seed, 2) as seedling, 3)
as the leaves unfold, 4) as buds form, 5) in full flower,
6) with petals dropping and seeds forming, 7) in its
dormant form, if a perennial, or at the end of its life, if
an annual. Variations on the life history of individual
plants in different environments could be shown for
a more complicated set of observations. The effect of
different degrees of light and shade, of composition
of soil, of amounts of water and of fertilizers, both
natural and artificial, may be shown. The number of
insect visits per hour to a flowering plant may be
recorded.

For animals and plants which live for many years,
seasonal studies are more appropriate. The seasonal
study of a chosen tree provides an interesting
project. The famous photographer, Steichen, ob-
served a small shadblow tree near his home for
several years and made a fascinating photographic
record of it under many different seasonal and
weather conditions. Young scientists with an interest
in photography may follow his lead.

In a city park, squirrels may be the object of obser-
vation throughout the different seasons of the year,
differences in coat and in degree of plumpness may
be estimated by observation, and the squirrels’
interest in food and bedding materials of different
types at different seasons of the year recorded. Date
of emergence of young squirrels from the nest, as
well as the degree of activity during the winter and
how it relates to temperature variations, may be
recorded. Population studies might also be made of
squirrels. Recording by means of camera, together
with charts on temperature and activity, might be
used to supplement a written report.

Observation of How Birds
Help Destroy Insects

Locate the nest of a catbird, swallow, flycatcher or
other insect—eating bird. Then find a spot where you
can watch it without disturbing the birds. After eggs
are hatched, watch the nest for an hour at the same
time each day and count the number of trips the
parent birds make to the nest. Do this for several
days and average the number of trips they make in
an hour. You can be fairly sure that on each trip they

 




 

 

make the birds are carrying at least one insect of
some kind and maybe several. After you have made
the count for several days and have averaged the
number of trips they make per hour, multiply this
figure by the number of hours of daylight. This will
give you an estimate of the total number of insects
this pair of birds destroys in a day.

Interpretation: Most forms of wildlife help
farmers and ranchers produce more and better crops
by checking insects, weeds and other pests. Wildlife
is equally helpful to the orchardist, gardener and city
dweller. The number of beneficial forms of wildlife a
well-managed farm supports is surprising. For
example, on a 100-acre farm in the Eastern United

States we might find more than 40 kinds of bene-
ficial birds, and more than a thousand beneficial
small mammals and several million beneficial insects
such as ladybeetles, aphis lions, and syrphus flies
which feed on plant lice; chalcid and tachinid flies
which feed on many kinds of insects; and assassin
bugs, robber flies, and nabids, which capture and
feed on other insects. The food habits of birds make
them especially valuable to agriculture. Because
birds have higher body temperatures, more rapid
digestion, and greater energy than most other
animals, they require more food. Nestling birds
usually consume as much or more than their own
weight in soft-bodied insects every, day. One young

ate at the same rate he would eat 181/3 pounds of
food in a day.

Some Factors in the Optimum
Environment for Crop-destroying Insects

Dr. William A. Albrecht of the Department of Soils
at the University of Missouri, College of Agriculture,
demonstrated experimentally a correlation between
soil fertility and the resistance of crop plants to insect
pests. One of his tests would be suitable for
demonstration if students have access to gardening
facilities.

Dr. Albrecht divided his experimental plot into two
parts: soil rich in compost and natural nutrients, and
exhausted soil on which too many crops had been
grown and harvested, leaving no organic matter to
return to the soil during the winter months. He
planted spinach equally on the two parts of the plot.
He found that spinach grown on fertile soil was less
subject to attacks by insect pests than spinach grown
on infertile. soil. He concluded that by correcting soil
deficiencies, plants may be protected against insects;
in other words, exhausted soil is a favorable
environmental condition for some insect pests.

International Problems in
Animal Ecology

International problems in animal ecology, while
not susceptible of classroom demonstrations, could
be made the subjects of interesting displays or talks.
International conservation organizations to which
interested students can write for first-hand informa-
tion and literature are listed below.

Suggested topics:

I. The Importation of Foreign Species of Animals
and it Ecological Impact.

In some cases, notably the rabbit in Aus-
tralia, the house sparrow in America, and the
mongoose in Jamaica, imported species have
taken hold and multiplied beyond all expecta-
tion. In other cases, as for instance the
importation of domestic cattle in Africa, non-
native species survive with difficulty.

What ecological factors are accountable for
these phenomena? Is the introduction of foreign
Species likely to be a wise solution to the
problems which given natural environment
presents to man? (An interesting sideline to this
subject is the accidental importation of animal
disease and insect pests from other countries
and the precautions taken by Customs
and Agriculture authorities to prevent this.)

II. The Protection of Migratory Birds.

With the draining of marshes and the rapid
expansion of urban areas, the provision of

18

sanctuaries for migratory birds poses a growing
problem in this hemisphere and in Europe.
Chart both the major flyways of migratory birds
and the sanctuaries afforded them. What
species are particularly endangered by urban
growth? What steps are being taken on an
international level for their protection?
Ill. The Pollution of the Sea.

Oil pollution of the sea, by ships dumping
excess oil and petroleum waste, is a major inter-
national problem because of its disastrous effect
on the environment of sea-birds. Birds that
become contaminated by petroleum waste are
unable to fly because their feathers are weighed
down and stuck together by the oil. Vast
numbers die of exposure and starvation. In
England, where many such birds are washed up
on beaches, citizens often band together in
voluntary bird—washing programs to clean the
birds, feather by feather.

IV. How the Advent of Civilization Alters the Ecol-
ogy ofan Area.

The activities of man drastically alter the eco-
logical patterns of both land and sea areas. A
dramatic example is the shark population of the
Mediterranean Sea which is said by local ob-
servers to have grown from negligible to
considerable during and after World War II.
What instances can you suggest at home and
abroad of similar transformations?

Some organizations whose literature may help are
listed on Page 59.

Domestic Problems in Animal Ecology

For a project paralleling the above, in the domestic
field, let the student write to his Congressman asking
for information on conservation legislation now
pending in Congress, as for instance, legislation
affecting parks and wilderness areas, endangered
species and marine mammals. The student may
examine the purpose of the legislation, the need for
it, and the conflict of interests which it involves.

Alternatively, what conservation legislation is now
in force? What benefits accrue from it? Is it adequate
to prevent the extinction of many species of plants
and animals?

Feeding Station Project

Set up a feeding station at home, or at school if
there is a secluded bit of shrubbery or a tree from
which the feeding box may be hung. In city schools
near parks, a station for bird feeding may be set up
with the permission of the Commissioner of Parks.
Learn the different foods most enjoyed by different
species. Which birds prefer sunflower seeds? Which
like suet? Raisins? Peanut butter? Cracked corn?
Millet? A commercial mixture of wild bird seed?

Photograph the birds that come to the station.

 

 




 

Take field trips and observe birds, recording all
species seen and photographing all you can. Write to
the National Audubon Society for information on
the birds in your area. Even in the most populous
cities, many different species may be seen if you
keep an assiduous watch and know when and where
to look for them.

Make an exhibit of your bird photographs. Draw
pictures of those you were unable to photograph.
Write descriptions of their habits underneath. If
possible, obtain the recording of bird songs to

recordings of their songs).

Bird Count Field Day

Some ornithologists and many amateurs who are
experts at field identification of different species of
birds enjoy making yearly field trips at the peak of
the spring migration to see how many species of bird
can be found in one day. This sort of expedition is
fully discussed in Roger Tory Peterson’s “Birds over
America” (New York: Dodd Mead and Co., 1948). It
is usual to chart the route in advance so that each
habitat will be visited at the time when the most birds
are visible there. A possible field trip starts before
dawn, when nightbirds may be counted (by their
song), moving to a pond or marsh at daybreak, then
to a wooded area, then, during the day, to a coastal
area, if possible. In May in Massachusetts, up to 161
species have been counted on such expeditions.

Check lists of species may be had from the
Audubon Society, 950 Third Avenue, New York,
NY. 10022. Field guides include Roger Tory
Peterson’s “Field Guide to the Birds” (Boston:
Houghton, Mifflin Co., Rev. ed., 1947 and 1968).

the Western Birds” by the same author (Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Co., 1961).

A Project in the Observation of the
Effects of Insecticides on Birds

If insecticides are used. on a large scale in your
community, there are a number of observations
which may be made in the field. We do not recom—
mend that students experiment with the effects of

I. Make repeated field trips to count the number
of birds, and of species of birds, to be found in a
given area before the area has been sprayed with
insecticides, while the spraying is going on, im-
mediately afterwards, a few days afterwards, a week
afterwards, a month afterwards. Do not forget to
allow for seasonal migrations. If there is a similar area
which has not been sprayed with insecticides within
reach, make similar counts there. If not, try to get in
touch with bird watchers who have taken counts in
the area before the spraying program was initiated.

The Audubon Society, 950 Third Avenue, New
York, NY. might be helpful in this respect. Besides
making a count of the living birds, search the ground
for dead and dying birds, and make a count of
these” Note whether the species are resident or
migratory in your area. Comparing the count of
living birds, the count of dead birds, and any
information about normal conditions in such an area,
attempt to determine which species have the
greatest resistance to insecticides. What is the
relation of mortality to diet? Also consider the
relation of the poisoning of songbirds to the welfare
of the larger predators, and to the ecology of the
area as a whole.

II. It has been suggested that the use of
insecticides on a large scale in the very early spring,
before migrations or nesting, results in a lower
mortality rate, especially in the northern states, since
most the resident winter birds there are seed—eating,
and so are susceptible to poisoning only by direct
contact or by contamination of their drinking supply.
(However, since the young of many seed-eaters are
insectivorous, seed-eaters will suffer during the
nesting season.) The federal government, state
governments, and local governments, as well as
private individuals who may use insecticides on a
large scale on their own property, may have different
policies on poison distribution. They may spray
different areas at different times of year, with
different concentrations of insecticides. Make counts
before the first spraying in all the areas, and continue
to count weekly in every area under consideration
until several weeks after the last area to be sprayed
has been sprayed. What conclusions do you reach?

Similar studies may be carried out on fish, in rivers
polluted by insecticides or industrial wastes.

Students are invited to send information they
collect to the Animal Welfare Institute to help protect
birds and animals against poisons.

describes work in a London school which may be
adapted by American teachers for use with common
birds in their part of the country.

Definite field projects are undertaken by small
groups in the class; these projects are planned so that
some problem will be solved by collecting informa-
tion by means of observations over a considerable
period of time; the actual data required are of a
simple quantitative kind, requiring little time for
collection. The results so obtained are suitable for
diagramatic presentation and are of considerable
interest, as well as having scientific value, giving a
feeling of achievement on completing the project,
and giving some insight into the methods of scientific
research. In addition, much is learned first hand of
the habits and behavior of the birds watched and
great interest in them stimulated; techniques of
measuring, mapping, keeping records, using refer-
ence books, making diagrams, etc. are also required.
The following are examples of projects which have
been successful and given satisfactory results.

Mallard Duck Census

Some 200 of these birds occur in the park and
many breed there. The actual numbers were
counted weekly, or more often if possible,
throughout the year. Interesting seasonal variations
were observed in numbers and these could be cor-
related with phases of the life cycle, pairing, nesting,
migrations; thus considerable knowledge of bird life
was gained. A repeat of this work 3 years later
proved of great interest, as the rises and falls in
numbers were found to occur at almost exactly the
same dates.

Winter Census of Blackheaded Gull

This bird comes inland to our district, llford, (an
eastern suburb of London) during the winter
months. A daily census was made of birds seen in
and near the park lakes; temperature records were
also kept and a close correlation was found with
numbers of birds; the birds being much more
numerous on cold days.

Blackbird Territory Mapping

A male with a distinctive patch of white feathers
on one wing was seen near the school; he was kept
under regular observation and threat display towards
neighboring cocks watched for. In this way the

20

boundaries of this bird’s territory were fixed and a
map made. As the bird stayed in the neighborhood
for several years comparison of his territory in
successive years was possible and of much interest.
The areas were measured and comparison with
work of Dr. Snow in Oxford Botanical Gardens and
others made, original papers being consulted.

Moorhen Territory Mapping and Census

About 6 pairs breed in the Park. Threat display
enables us to fix territory boundaries and census
reveals seasonal increases in Autumn.

Study of Woodpecker Holes in Trees

An area of woodland containing a number of
holes of the Greater Spotted Woodpecker, made
over a period of time, provided an interesting
exercise. The height of the hole from the ground was
measured, size of hole where possible; and a study
made of the trees attacked, the different kind of trees
being identified.

STUDIES IN HUMAN BIOLOGY

These have similar aims to the bird studies, being
intended to give training in scientific method and
presentation of results; the following are examples of
satisfactory projects.

Study of Absenteeism in the School

Information was extracted from attendance
registers, dating back over past years as well as the
present one, and the weekly totals of absence shown
as graphs. The results are of great interest, providing
significant information about epidemics of the

common cold, which is the main cause of absence in
this School.

Study of Height in Individual Child

By measuring the heights of groups of children at
regular intervals information about individual
difference, changes with age etc. can be obtained.
General conclusions must not, however, be drawn
unless sufficiently large numbers have been
measured to give results which are statistically
significant.

 

 




 

 

 

SAVE THE WHALES

 

An Ecology Action Program that High School
Biology Students Can Take Part in Through Study,
Inquiry, and Personal Involvement

Current Status: The sperm and baleen whales
were placed on the Endangered Species List by the
Secretary of the Interior, December, 1970.

The Secretary of Commerce issued regulations
which ended the last remnant of whaling in the
United States, March, 1971.

The Stockholm Conference on the Human
Environment voted unanimously for a ten year
moratorium on commercial whaling in 1971. The
International Whaling Commission rejected the
moratorium.

Research needed in order to learn about whales.
Very little is known about whale behavior. Only
recently has serious research been undertaken which
has brought to light information which would be
incredible if not scientifically documented Witness,
the‘ ‘Songs of the Humpback Whale” recorded by
Dr Roger Payne of Rockefeller University. Similar
studies of the endangered bowhead whale and
southern right whale have been undertaken. These
are first steps toward the understanding of the
behavior and capacities of whales. Their brains are
huge, their vocalization complex.

Numbers of whales. The blue whale population in
the 1930’s was estimated at 30 to 40,000. By 1963
intensive hunting had reduced it to an estimated
1,950. It is now “totally protected” by international
agreements, yet 66 blue whales were killed in the
1967-68 whaling season! The numbers of the dif-
ferent species vary, but all that are being com-
mercially hunted continue to decline precipitously.
The only species which has increased in recent years
is the protected California gray whale.

Commercial Exploitation. Whaling is done on a
large scale by Japan and the USSR which catch
almost 90% of all whales killed annually. Other
whaling countries include Peru, South Africa,

Norway Australia, Spain, Denmark, Iceland, Soma-
lia, China, Korea and Chile. The United States once
purchased between 20 and 30% of the world whale
oil production each year but now prohibits importa-
tion of any part or product of endangered whales.

Uses. All whale products can be substituted for by
synthetic or other means. Uses include suntan oil, lip-
stick, cat food, mink food and margarine. The
whaling industry is the least productive source of oil
of any industry listed by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations. For example, the
world’s sunflower seed oil production in 1968 was
seven times that of whale oil.

Comparative figures on the death of whales. The
total of whales killed in the 1960’s was greater than
any other ten year period since whales and men
evolved. In 1933, 28,907 were killed to produce
2,606,201 barrels of oil. Twice as many whales had
to be killed to produce only about half as much oil in
1966, when the figures showed 57,891 killed to pro-
duce 1,546,906. Younger whales and smaller
species, even down to dolphins, are now being killed.

Technology. The technical “advances” in whale
killing no longer provide efficiency of production.
Catcher boats continue to become bigger and more
powerful, but the average production of whale oil
per catcher boat per day’s work has fallen from a
peak of almost 120 barrels in 1955 to little more than
30 barrels in 1967. Helicopters, sonar, whale-scaring
devices and explosive harpoons make the move
toward “commercial extinction” of more and more
whale species inevitable if not stopped.

What can be done? The only possible solution is a
moratorium on the killing of whales for a minimum
of ten years. Whales should be Studied, not killed
during this rest period. No whale, large or small,
should be killed before 1987, when a full report on
the scientific studies carried on should be made to all
nations.

Animal Welfare Institute, Pages 57-58.)

ANIMAL BEHAVIOR

 

Observations on Tree Squirrel Behavior
By Professor Vagn F lyger
University of Maryland

Various species of tree squirrels are present in
wooded portions of most of North America. Each
species has its own characteristic patterns of be-
havior which can readily be observed under proper
conditions. Squirrels are diurnal and pay relatively
little attention to movements inside of a glass
window. Thus by placing a feeding station a foot or
two from a convenient window, they can be watched
closely enough to observe details of expressions.

A convenient feeding station can be made by
inserting two ice picks (handles removed, points up)
into a 12” long log. An ear of dry corn is impaled on
each ice pick. Once squirrels have discovered the
corn they will eat it one kernel at a time while sitting
on the log. Only the germ is consumed; the rest is
dropped and consumed by birds. As the corn is
consumed new ears should be placed on the ice
picks once or twice a day.

After a number of squirrels have become regular
visitors to the feeding station observations can be
started. First it will be necessary to learn to recognize
individuals and give them names. Look for
differences in body color, length and fullness of tail,
torn ears, facial scars, sex and other characteristics. It
is necessary to look closely. Keep a record for each
animal and record when the squirrel feeds and its re-
actions toward other squirrels. Try to determine the
following:

1. Who dominates whom. Observe who chases
whom. Can you make a table ranking indi-
viduals from the most dominant to the most
submissive? Is rank related to sex and age?
What is the advantage of social hierarchy or ter-
ritorality? What seems to determine the rank of
an individual? Does relative rank change with
age?

2. If you have two squirrel species present how
does their behavior differ?

3. At what time of day are squirrels most active? If
you have a school weather station you can
compare weather and activity. How does this
vary with weather and seasons?

4. How do squirrels communicate? What sounds
do they utter? What are their threat gestures?
Watch them lash out with their claws at each
other. What signals or expressions can you
determine from the tail, ears and face?

5. What senses are used in social interactions?
How?

6. What happens when a can of peanuts (in the
shell) is placed on the feeder? Do they eat them
or bury them? Where are peanuts buried, all in

22

one place or scattered about? Try to find a
buried nut. How do the squirrels find the nuts
when they need them?

7 How do squirrels interact with birds? How do
they respond to danger—approaching dog, car
or man?

Animal Senses

It is well known that the power of different senses
is more fully developed in some species than in
others; however, very little is known about many of
these, and it is a field in which keen observers can
make significant observations.

A pet dog can demonstrate his ability to hear
sounds and to smell odors which are imperceptible
to human beings. For example, using a high
frequency dog whistle whose high-pitched sound
cannot be heard by members of the class, observe
the dog cocking his head and listening. A dog trained
to come to such a whistle may be shown to the class.

The simplest demonstration of a dog’s highly de-
veloped sense of smell is a walk in the country with a
dog, watching him follow scents of animals whose
identity cannot always be guessed but which will
sometimes be seen when the dog causes a rabbit to
run into view or a pheasant to fly up out of the grass.
In the classroom, the dog’s sense of smell might be
demonstrated by dragging a sausage or some other
tidbit over the floor to a desk and placing it in the
drawer of the desk. The dog, if he is not nervous
owing to strange surroundings, will be able to trace
the tidbit and stand sniffing where it is hidden. A dog
visiting a classroom should be given time to make
himself acquainted and feel at home before he is
asked to show any of his abilities.

Although the dog’s-sense of hearing and sense of
smell are more highly developed than the corres-
ponding senses in human beings, his sense of vision
is less acute.

A student project might give evidence of the rela-
tive sensory powers of the dog collected by direct ob-
servation on the part of the student. A correlative
project might be presentation of information
gathered from the literature on sensory powers
highly developed in other animals, for example:
vision in hawks and other birds of prey; the sense of
touch in nocturnal or burrowing animals whose
whiskers transmit very delicate touches; the so-called
“radar” of bats in which high-pitched sounds, above
the range which the human ear can perceive, are

emitted and the distance from objects judged by the
bat on the rebound of his cries, the ability of dolphins
to distinguish between metals under water by similar
means.

Color perception by different species of animals
might be tested. The general assumption that most
birds and many insects but few mammals can dis-
tinguish between colOrs may be tested. 15 there a cor-
relation between the coloring of the animal itself, the
coloring of its food, and species sensitivity to color?

A Project in the Observation of the
Roasting Habits of Birds in the Fields

Students of bird behavior have recently dis—
covered that during the nesting season the female
robin spends the night alone on the nest: although
during the day the male bird defends the nesting
territory. at night he goes to roost with all the other
males of the vicinity. Roosting habits vary from
species to species, and little is known of the habits of
many species, so that the observation of students in

this field could be both interesting and valuable.

Choose some readily observable species of bird
which is resident in your vicinity. House sparrows or
starlings are suitable if other species are difficult to
find. Observe the social behavior of the chosen
species. Does it live in a closely-knit flock. staying
together and feeding together for the greater part of
the day, and roosting together at night? Does the
whole flock fly away from an area at once, on a
given signal? Or is a flock formed only for certain
purposes, for roosting together, at nesting time, as a
colony, or when feeding? Is the flock seasonal? Does
it exist during the winter only? For purposes of
migration only? Does the flock roost in the same
place each night, or does it move from place to place
to roost? If the chosen species does not roost as a
flock. what are its habits?

Students may make detailed reports of their
findings in this field; they may find it interesting to
read some of the extant studies of bird behavior,
which will give them an orientation to the subject
(see also the bibliography on Page 54).

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

Ernest P. Walker

In large cities where it is difficult to observe animals in natural surroundings, interesting studies in
animalbehavior may be made at zoological gardens. Different related species may be observed there;
related domestic species also provide an opportunity for comparative studies in habits. For example,
how do patterns ofgrooming and ofplay on the part of this lioness and her cubs compare with those of
a cougar and her cubs or with a family of domestic cats? Make a comprehensive study of the similar-
ities and differences in these and other traits that you can observe in members of the cat family from
the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia. What observations can you make of the difference in behavior

of captive andfree animals?

It should be mentioned here that captive animals
need continual attention and living quarters that
approximate their own environment.

Students should be made aware of the thoughtless
exploitations that are imposed on non-domesticated
animals and that they can help by staying alert in
observing the way the inhabitants are treated in 200$

and animal parks.

Cruel treatment or unhealthy conditions can be
reported to the Animal Welfare Institute, PO. Box

The following series of questions were prepared
by Peter Batten, author of Living Trophies (Thomas
Y. Crowell Company, NY. 1976).

 




 

 

Evaluating Your Local 200

On your next visit to a zoo, look beyond the public
relations brochures and “endangered species” signs,
and check the following:

Are pens and cages of adequate size; can the
animals walk at least four times their own
length?

Does the animal have free access to sanctuary
from visitors; is there a “den” in the cage? (Or
are inside shelter doors closed; no box or den
provided?) J

Do “daytime” animals have adequate light
and/or sun? (Or are they in dark interior
cages with no access to outside runs or U/V
light?)

Is food eaten promptly at feeding time? (or is
there leftover food on floors and dishes?)

Are cages clean and sanitary? (Or are stools and
urine on the floor; are stools loose?)

Is there clean drinking water, free of algae and
debris, in all cages?

Are nocturnal animals able to avoid direct or
bright light?

Are young animals with parents? (Or labeled
“rejected” in a glass—fronted nursery?)

Do hoofed animals walk easily? (Or do they
look like they’re wearing snowshoes?)

Are great apes active? Do they have company
and things to do? (Or are they in small pens,
alone, with nothing to do but sleep and eat?)

Are keepers close to animal exhibits, supervising
visitors? Are they working? On what?

Do elephants and other large animals have
rubbing posts or mounds in their pens?

Are bars or other restraint methods safe? (Or
are there sharp spikes or other fixtures which
might harm the animals?)

'If exhibits are watervmoated, are there visible

means of escape for animals should they fall
in?

Do dry—moated exhibits have a heavy layer of
soft material (hay, straw, etc.) to protect
animals if they fall?

Do birds have at least two separate perches or
roosts? (Or can they fly only into walls,
fences, or floor if frightened?)

Are the animals at the front of the cage, and do
they appear alert and relaxed? (Or are they
curled up near the back of the exhibit, or
pacing nervously?)

Are birds in open areas able to fly? (Or are their
wings pinioned—look for short wings when
they stretch?)

Do birds in aviaries have ample flight space and
height? (Or are perches difficult to reach
except by helicopter?)

Do cages or dens have artificial heat or cooling
installed; on a warm day do animals breathe
normally?

25

Do all animals have free access to a choice of
heat, shade, light?

Are marine mammals kept in salt water; are the
pools large, round or oval, and with adequate
haul-out space, and a suitable color? (Or does
the color of the pool reflect sunlight?) Is the
water absolutely clear and clean? (Or are fish
debris floating on top or bottom?)

Are sea lions active and alert? (Discount visitor-
fed seals begging.) Are they fed by hand,
individually? (Or is fish thrown to them in the
pool?) Are their eyes a dark, lustrous brown?
(Or are they closed, slightly closed, or opaque
bluish-white?) Do they appear to be in
general good condition? (They should look
rubbery with no visible vertebrae or ribs.)

Do animals that naturally dig in the earth have a
floor which permits this activity? (Or are they
on concrete, bricks, tile, or other synthetic
material?)

The first part of each question should be answered
YES. If this is not so, ask to see the zoo director or his
assistant—not the public relations person or “educa-
tional curator”—and ask WHY; then brace yourself
for evasive answers or rhetoric.

INSECT BEHAVIOR

By Dr. Dewey M. Caron

Associate Professor of Agriculture
University of Maryland

Insects are the most abundant animals on earth.
The student who studies living insects will find them
fascinating. A wide variety of insects can be studied
in their natural habitat, and it is also very easy to
keep several insects in captivity to study at closer
range.

The Social Insects

A project designed to introduce students to a
study of animal behavior, through the
observation of the behavior of bees, ants, or
termites, living as a colony.

The social instinct in bees, ants, and termites, and
the intricate structure of their social life, are readily
observable phenomena which will attract students
on a number of levels. Students whose interests are
oriented away from science towards history or
literature should be encouraged to study this project.
Insect society shows the extent to which social
organization can be developed and integrated on a
physiological instinctive basis, so comparisons
between insect society and human government can
be interesting, if pursued in a scientific manner. Also,
on the subject of the social insects, there are a
number of very readable books which, though
recognized as factually accurate, have literary value
as well; some students may enjoy reading
Maeterlinck or Fabre on the subject. There are also,
of course, many other scientific studies in the field,

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

some of which are listed in the bibliography of this
project.
Laboratory Work: Establish a colony of bees, ants or
termites for observation in the classroom.
Bees, ants and termites and specially constructed
observation hives or nests may be obtained from bio-
logical supply houses.

Ant Colony

Establishing an ant colony is not difficult. Find a
natural ants’ nest by watching ants on a warm day
and following their tracks back to their colony. Ants
may be collected into a jam jar with a screw-top lid.

Excavate the natural nest cautiously with a trowel,
and collect ants, with earth, on a teaspoon, taking
care not to maim them. You will need:

About 100 worker ants, which are small and
wingless.

Some of the earth from the nest.

Some pupae, about 50.

At least one wingless queen. (Without a queen
the colony will not perpetuate itself but still last
for awhile and be of interest.)

If the ants are to be carried far, the queens should
travel in a separate bottle. Small winged males may
be included but they are not essential.

The ants should be put into the artificial nest as
soon as possible.

To make an observation nest, take:

3 glass plates, 6” x 8” or larger.
2 pieces of cardboard 6” x 8” or larger.
4 pieces of 1/4” x 1/8” balsa wood.

balsa cement.

gummed paper.

4 slices of cork 1/2” thick.

a piece of wood 1” thick and 1” wider and
longer than the nest.

a baking pan larger than the piece of wood.

The wooden stage rests in the baking pan, held in
place by four nails, driven at an angle into the
corners, and projecting as far as the walls of the
baking pan. Attach the cork legs with glue to the
stage, and to the floor of the nest. (This floor is made
of a glass plate attached with gummed tape to a
sheet of cardboard. The cardboard side must be on
the outside of the nest, facing down.) Affix the walls
of balsa wood, in which there should be an entrance
gap of 1/2”, with balsa cement to the floor and to the
glass plate which is the ceiling.

Bind the whole nest box around the edges with
gummed tape. Prepare the third sheet of glass in the
same way as the floor; it rests on top of the lid to
keep out light when the colony is not under observa-
tion. Into the space between the floor and ceiling,
pour moist sand almost filling the compartment. Fill
the moat with water. Ants will feed on honey, which
may be spread on the wooden stage. If the sand in
the nest becomes dry, introduce a few drops of water
through the entrance hole with a pipette, taking care
not to moisten the larvae.

Ants may be released at the end of the school year
near their original nest.

Students may observe the different classes in the
colony, the life cycle of each class, its function, and
the daily routine of activity, and record the
expansion of the nest and the activities of the ants.

Bee Hive

It is not difficult to establish an observation bee
hive, but, if this is your first experience with honey
bees, it is advisable to ask a bee-keeper to help you.
Hobbyist bee-keepers are usually willing to share
their knowledge.

Observation bee hives are available commercially
or you can construct one from wood and glass. If
you want to order a bee hive write: Entomology
Extension, 1735 Neil Avenue, Columbus, Ohio
43210.

You can install your observation hive in the spring
as soon as daytime temperatures go above 60 F.
The earlier the installation, the more important it is to
provide supplemental food. Bees can be fed a dilute
sugar solution (one part sugar to one part water).

Bees and a queen can be purchased. The bees are
sold by the pound and are shipped through the
United States mail. You will want a two pound
package with queen. The bees are shaken from the
package, and the queen added in her separate cage
so the bees can release her after another day or two.
A bee-keeper should help in installation.

It is better to establish your observation bee hive

g1




4g.)

from a frame taken from an established bee colony.
Select a frame that has a developing bee brood,
honey, and pollen. Shake in extra worker bees. It is
not necessary to add a queen if you have a young
brood on the frame since the bees will raise a new
queen.

The frame and bees should be established directly
from the bee-keeper’s colony without transportation
delay. As soon as the bees are inside, close all
entrances and move the hive to your prepared
location. Modify a window to allow the bees to fly
outside while the observation unit rests on a sturdy
platform inside. If the observation hive needs any
modification or service, take it outside (after plugging
all entrances) and do the necessary work. When
handling bees always wear a bee veil to protect the
face from stings and use a smoker to disrupt guard
bees and make them gentle. Gloves should be worn
if you fear being stung. IF YOU HAVE AN
ALLERGY TO BEE STINGS, DO NOT ATTEMPT
TO DO ANY OF THE WORK WITH THE HIVE.
You may still observe once they are safely
established since they cannot get out into the room.

An alternative to establishing an observation bee
hive yourself would be to use an existing one. Many
parks, nature centers, and some museums maintain
them.

Things to Do:

Time the queen in her egg laying activities.

Observe worker bees and drones and record their
activities.

Observe and record the process of storing ripening
nectar into honey.

Make records of returning forages with bright balls
of pollen on their hind legs.

Measure the progress in wax comb construction
and determine the percentage of bees involved in
this.

Determine the pattern of foraging by counting the
number of bees leaving and returning at time
intervals over daylight hours. Repeat on cloudy and
partly cloudy days and compare the figures.

Your observation bee hive will have openings for
ventilation and feeding. Introduce pieces of grass or
wood and record the behavior of bees cleaning their
hive.

Find a dead bee and mark it with a tiny dot of air—
plane model paint and drop it in the top so you can
watch the bees remove it.

If, through accident, bees escape into the room,
turn off the lights and the bees will be attracted to a
window; open it to let them escape.

Keeping and Studying Living Insects

Little equipment is necessary to keep live insects
in captivity for short time periods. Insects can be
placed in glass jars, cardboard boxes, screen or gauze
cages. Sometimes, it is best to leave the insects in

27

their natural habitat and construct a cage or cages
around the insects.

When insects are taken from their habitat, food
and water must be kept available. Plant feeding
insects need fresh and healthy plant parts. Flower
feeding insects can be given sugar water or a diluted
honey solution. Small amounts should be put in con-
tainers that will not permit the insect to fall in and
drown. Predaceous insects are much more difficult
to feed but many do not eat frequently, so they can
usually be caged for a brief time, examined and then
released without the need for feeding. If feeding is
necessary, the food should be the same as in their
habitat and should be presented as naturally as
possible.

Studying Insect Life History

There are two basic types of life histories among
the larger insects. Beetles, flies, butterflies and bees
are a few of the insects that have complete meta-
morphosis: they have four life history stages—egg,
larva, pupa, and adult. Cockroaches, bugs, and
many aquatic insects exhibit only three life history
stages—egg, nymph, and adult. Nymphs are
basically wingless, smaller forms of the adult, while a
larva or pupa usually is completely different from the
adult form.

Insects may be raised from any stage and may be
selected from a natural environment or at one of the
biological supply firms that offer eggs, larvae, pupae
or nymphs of several species together with complete
instructions, containers, and food.

The booklet. “First Aid and Care of Small
Animals” by Ernest P. Walker, an Animal Welfare
Institute publication distributed free on request to
science teachers, describes a method of starting and
maintaining a house fly culture. Two books listed in
the reference, “An Introduction to the Study of
Insects” and “A Manual of Entomological Tech-
niques” also describe the methods for maintaining
insect cultures. The April, 1976 issue of “The
American Biology Teacher”, devoted entirely to
insects, has a section on their rearing.

Another insect you might want to rear is the cock-
roach. Cockroaches are omnivores and easy to
maintain. Wax moths and dry food beetles are
interesting and easy to keep. Aquatic insects can be
raised. Wood boring insects are easily brought to
adulthood. but observing can be difficult. Caterpillars
are interesting to watch as they grow, pupate, and
emerge as moths or butterflies. Fresh food must be
kept available and the waste must be removed.

When rearing insects, you should make detailed
observations, measure the food and water con-
sumed, observe and categorize each life stage. You
can do population studies with some of the insects
such as the dry food beetles, crickets, or flies. The
behavior of singing insects is a separate study.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Field Trip to a Flower

Virtually any natural environment can be used to
observe and perform experiments on insects. An
excellent place is a patch of wildflowers. Start your
studies before the plants bloom, or when you first
notice some of the flowers. Make a record of the way
insects behave in your patch.

Observe at different times of the day from early
growth to full flower to the end of the growing
season. Do not disturb the patch in a way that could
alter the environment.

Things to Do

Note what insects visit the flowers to collect pollen
and nectar. Which is the most common? How much
time does the bee spend on the flower? From that,
estimate how many flowers can be visited in a day.
What insects prey on the flower visitor? How do they
hunt and capture their prey? What insects are
present feeding on other parts of the plant and what
species are feeding on them? Make fresh bouquets
of the same type of flower from other locations to
see if they attract more flower visitors and more
predators. Cover a portion of your flowers and deter-
mine how that affects your flower visiting population
of bees. Add droplets of sugar water to parts of the
flower or plant that do not have sugar and see if the
flower visitors alter their normal behavior to take
advantage of the sugar water.

 

Camouﬂage and Defense Coloration
in Moths

Let the student attract a collection of moths with a
strong light by night in the spring months and
observe and sketch a number of typical wing
patterns. Or let the student consult a textbook on
entymology for the same purpose. How are the
many patterns and colors of moths adapted to blend
with their environment? Let the student read the
chapter “Defence by Color” in “Curious Naturalists”
by Niko Tinbergen. Tinbergen’s studies show that the
eye-like patterns on the wings of certain moths
discourage predatory birds by frightening them. Do
any of the other moths observed have such wing
patterns?

Nature Photography

Interesting Science Fair exhibits involving wild
mammals, birds and other creatures living in a free,
natural state can be made by careful observation and
photographs. Such photographs can bring back to all
who see the Fair a record, scientifically accurate, of a
wide variety of life habits and behavior of members
of the animal kingdom. Records of the development
of different types of plants may also be made with
the camera. Although some camera equipment is ex-
pensive, excellent photographs can be made with
simple box cameras too. Careful observation is the
first prerequisite in obtaining a first-rate series of
photographs of the chosen subject.

For advanced work, a publication of the National
Audubon Society, 950 Third Avenue, New York,
NY. 10022, may be purchased.

The infinite variety of camouflage is suggested by these three: a striped tree frog from Africa, a yellow
Atelbpus and a green and black Dendrobates from Panama.

GENETICS

 

How is Flower Color Inherited
in the Morning Glory?

Use the easily obtained commercial varieties of
Ipomea tricolor, Heavenly Blue, its white-flowered
mutant Pearly Gates, and possibly the related Blue
Star. These grow well in pots (it is helpful to soak
seeds overnight before planting), need some sun,
and do better in fall and spring than in midwinter.
The plants will twine around a stake and if the apical
buds of main stem and branches are pinched off, a
bushy, easily-handled plant is formed.

A day or so before a flower bud opens, slit it down
the side and remove the five pollen-producing
stamens to prevent self pollination. The day the
flower opens, dust the stigma with pollen from a
plant of different flower color. Tag the flower includ-
ing names of both parents and the date. If the cross
takes, a seed pod will enlarge and ripen. The hybrid
seed may be planted as soon as it is ripe. When the
hybrid plant flowers record flower color, allow
flowers to self pollinate, and when seeds are ripe,
collect them. At least a dozen plants should beraised
from this seed, and flower color of each recorded.
Backcrosses of the F1 hybrid on each of the parent
types may be made also.

Parent generation—

Heavenly Blue (used as female)
Pearly Gates (used as male)

F1 generation—

Flower color? All plants of this generation
have flowers of the same color.

F2 generation—

Some will have blue flowers, some white—
the ratio of blue to white should be
obtained.

If plants are grown out of doors, flowers must be
protected by paper or cheesecloth bags against
pollen contamination.

A Demonstration of an Allotetraploid,
a Species Hybrid with Doubled
Chromosome Number, & its Two Parents

Ipomoea Sloteri (Cardinal Climber) is considered
to have arisen as a hybrid between two species of
star glory, Ipomoea coccinea with entire simple
leaves and Ipomoea pennata (Cypress Vine) with
finely divided compound leaves. The chromosome
number of the probably sterile hybrid doubled spon-
taneously producing a fertile plant which sets seeds
readily, breeds true, and is intermediate between the
parent species in certain characters such as leaf form.
It crosses with the parents only very rarely. The
increased chromosome number accounts for the
increase in flower size as compared with the parents.
If a microscope is available, increased size of pollen

29

grains and of leaf epidermal cells may be dem-
onstrated.

Ipomoea coccinea, 2n =28, contributed 14
chromosomes. Ipomoea pennata, 2n =30, con—
tributed 15 chromosomes. Doubling of the chromo-
somes gives Ipomoea Sloteria a 2n chromosome
number of 58.

These three types of plants with attractive foilage
and bright little flowers are easily grown indoors in
pots or outdoors. They provide an illustration of one
of the ways in which new plant species sometimes
arise in nature, i.e. by hybridization and subsequent
doubling of chromosome number.

Agricultural Research in Rural Areas

Many experiments and tests can be made by
students in rural areas which are impossible in city
areas.

Rural schools can engage in long—term tests with
small samples of several different farm crops grown
in their section of the country. For example, a rural
school might try a series of crosses of hybrid corn
over a three-year period. Publications on the subject
from the United States Department of Agriculture,
together with advice from the County Agricultural
Agent or the State Agricultural Experimental Sta-
tion, may be used to provide basic information.
Results may be displayed in regional Science Fairs or
with 4-H or Future Farmers of America groups.

The crossing of corn, beans and other crop or
truck garden plants can be used to teach scientific
theories of heredity and to produce practical results.

(See p. 30).

Breeding of Insect-Resistant Plants

The use of many insecticides is under close
scrutiny because residues left on food may cause
acute illness if present in sufficiently large amounts.
Even when a fraction of one part per million re-
mains, scientific evidence suggests that it may con-
tribute towards the total amount of carcinogenic
substances stored in the body, ultimately causing the
individual to succumb to cancer. For these reasons
and because spraying of powerful insecticides is
detrimental to wildlife, which may be killed directly
by poisoning or indirectly through upsetting the
balance of nature in any given area, it is important to
find other ways to prevent insect damage to crops.

One excellent method is the breeding of plants
which have a high natural immunity to a common
insect pest. For example, some kinds of corn are re-
sistant to the corn earworm (see Technical Bulletin
No. 1160, United States Department of Agriculture,
Washington, DC. Also see “The What and How of

Plant Reproduction

Make a comparative study of flower structure and
pollination mechanisms. Preserve the flowers
examined by pressing them, or make careful draw-
ings colored with water color, or keep a record by
means of photography for display in classroom or
Science Fair.

Make a study of the dispersal of fruits and seeds in
a selected group of plants. Indicate agents contribut-
ing to dispersal, such as birds, wind and animals
which carry sticky or burry seeds in their coats.
Display representative types of specialized seed
dispersal mechanisms, for example: milk weed
seeds, winged seeds which glide, seeds covered with
edible pulp, seeds of extreme lightness or heaviness,
etc. Make a study of seed numbers in different plants
and compare with length of life of the plant and
numbers of the plant in the locality. (For example, an
oak tree and the grass growing beneath it.)

. Principles of Heredity
Demonstrated by Fruit Flies

Experiments in genetics ranging from the simple
to the highly complex can be carried out with fruit
flies (Drosophila melanogaster). Wild flies of this and
other Drosophila species may be attracted in the
warm months by leaving ripe banana pulp out. Wild
type flies and a variety of mutant strains differing
from wild type may be purchased from biological
supply houses which show easily differentiated
characteristics such as curved wings. vestigial wings
or long wings, different eye colors or body colors.
CrOsses of these may be made in the class-room and
the laws of heredity demonstrated. Working with
Drosophila a 10x magnifier is needed.

Housing

Drosophila are commonly raised in bottles or vials,
but as these require sterilizing, it has been suggested
by Professor Lloyd L. Arnold II (in “Breeding
Drosophila in Disposable Plastic Containers,” The
American Biology Teacher, Vol 19, No. 8,
December, 1957, pp. 248-251) that containers such
as those used for cottage cheese are suitable.

They must be new and unused. The solid top of
the container is removed and clear plastic film placed
in the ring which holds it in place. The flies can be
observed without disturbing them through this clear
film. The medium on which the flies feed may be
anchored to the bottom with a strip of gauze three
inches long and one inch wide. The gauze is
attached to the bottom with two drops of liquid
cement. and this prevents the medium from falling
out when shaking out the flies.

lf preferred, the flies may be reared in sterilized
bottles or vials. The bottles should be tilted while the
medium is hardening in the bottom.

31

Food

Several different types of media may be prepared for
the flies. For a small amount of simple medium, dip a
piece of ripe banana into a suspension of yeast. Push
a piece of paper towel into the banana. Flies grow
well with this medium but it may become liquid so
the bottle or container cannot be turned upside
down.
For a solid medium Professor Arnold suggests:

Solution A

Water 900 ml.
Agar 15 gm.
Brewer’s Yeast 50 gm.
Sucrose 100 gm.
Potassium Phosphate (Monobasic) 1 gm.
Solution B

Water 200 ml.
Potassium and Sodium tartrate 8gm.
Calcium Chloride 0.5 gm.
Manganous Chloride 0.5 gm.
Ferrous sulfate 4.5 gm.

1) To 900 ml. of rapidly boiling water slowly add
the previously mixed dry ingredients of Solution A,
and c00k for 10 minutes stirring frequently to avoid
sticking. 2) Remove from heat and add Solution B.
3) Allow the medium to cool a few minutes and add
5 ml. Propionic acid. 4) Pour medium into con-
tainers to a depth of 1/2 inch or so (ca 50 cc.); this
yields 20 containers per batch of medium. 5) Close
with regular cover and store in the refrigerator. Put in
a drop or two of thick yeast suspension 24 hours be-
fore use, or, if the yeast spreads too rapidly over the
food surface, sprinkle dry yeast after the culture is set
up.

A number of other types of media may be made
using molasses or karo syrup for the sugar content
and oatmeal or cream of wheat in place of agar, or a
combination of agar and cornmeal or tomato paste
may be used. Students may be interested in trying
different types of media. All of them are sticky so that
it is essential to avoid letting the flies fall into them
when the flies are anesthetized for observation and
placement in new containers or bottles. The flies are
delicate and a camel’s hair brush is the best instru-
ment to use in moving them without damage.

Anesthesia

Ether, properly administered, renders Drosophila
unconscious in a few seconds. Flies must not be left
in the ether chamber too long or they may die. If the
paper containers are used, etherization may be ac-
complished by means of a hypodermic needle which
is pushed through the paper (see article mentioned
above from The American Biology Teacher). The
needle is attached to a polyethylene bottle (in this
case a catsup bottle, into the pointed spout of which
the base of the needle was fitted) and three facial
tissues saturated with ether are placed in the bottle.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The needle (not bigger than #20) is inserted in the
wall of the container and the bottle gently and
repeatedly squeezed, thus introducing gaseous ether
into the container. During this process, the container
must be held on its side or upside down to prevent
the flies from falling into the medium. When most of
the flies are unconscious, stop the introduction of
ether and wait for the rest to drop. Then turn the
container upside down on a white surface. Holding
the cover down on the table, remove the body of the
container. By this method the flies will be lying con-
veniently in the cover of the container from whence
they can be selected and moved with the camel’s
hair brush to a new culture. They will be easy to see
against the White surface which shows through the
plastic film top of the container.

Anesthetization of flies in bottles may be done as
follows: Take a bottle the same size as the bottle in
which the flies are contained. Place its mouth over
that of the first bottle, moving quickly to avoid
releasing the flies. Attract the flies into the second
bottle by placing an electric light behind it. Quickly
separate the bottles and stop their mouths, the first
with its regular stopper, the second with the
etherizing stopper. To prepare the latter, stick a
common pin or a piece of wire into a cork bottle
stopper and attach absorbent cotton to it. Put a few
drops of ether on the cotton. As soon, as the flies are
unconscious, shake them out on a white surface
from which they may be transferred to new colony
bottles.

Marking

Each container or bottle should be marked with
the date at which the flies were introduced, a descrip-
tion or other identification of the flies, and any other
information desired.

Crossing Strains

The male may be distinguished from the female by
a rounded abdomen whose posterior tip, viewed
dorsally. is solid black. Virgin females must be used.
To obtain them, release all adult flies from the stock
bottle. Young flies which emerge and are collected
within the following 12 hour period will be virgin.

Place the anesthetized male and female flies se-
lected in the fresh culture bottle or container. They
must not fall into the medium while unconscious. To
avoid this, place them on a paper strip stuck in the
culture medium, or, if paper containers are being
used, place them on the inside of the clear plastic top
which is lying face upward on the table, then place
the body of the container, upside down, in its place,
fitted into the top. Wait till the flies have recovered to
place the container right-side up again. Make a few
breathing holes with a sharp needle in the film. The
whole life-cycle of the flies is from ten to fifteen days
depending upon the warmth of the weather.

32

Demonstrations and Experiments

The most striking and easily demonstrated law of
heredity is that of Mendel’s 3:1 ratio. It is necessary
to purchase from a biological supply house two or
more cultures of flies, a wild type culture and a
mutant strain. For example, a wild type fly with its
long wings may be crossed with a fly which breeds
true for vestigial wings. In the first filial generation,
(F1), it will be found that all flies look like the parent
whose trait is dominant, in this case, the long wings.
But the vestigial wing trait is not lost for good as will
be found if the offspring are crossed with one
another. The recessive trait will reappear in about
one quarter ofthe flies in this second generation (F2).
Three quarters of them will have the dominant trait.
This demonstration can only be carried out with flies
that breed true, for if the original parent showing the
dominant characteristic was hybrid, the ratio will be
1:1.

Some characteristics are sex-linked, that is, they
produce different results depending on which parent
has the characteristic. For example, if a red-eyed
female and a white-eyed male are crossed, all the
offspring in the first filial generation (F1) will have red
eyes. In the second inbred generation (F2), the
females are red-eyed, but the males are red and
white in equal numbers. But if the cross is made
between a white-eyed female and a red-eyed male
different observations will be made in both the first
and second generation crosses. The F1 females are
red-eyed, but the F1 males are white eyed. In F2 both
males and females show red and white eyes in equal
numbers. Many further suggestions as to crosses
may be obtained from biological supply houses
which provide them on request with the flies
purchased.

Flies which breed true for recessive characteristics
which are not sex-linked may be used to
demonstrate the ratio of 9:3:3:1 in the offspring. In all
demonstrations, of ratios, it must be borne in mind
that small numbers of flies may show less exact ad-
herence to the ratio than large numbers do. It is well
to obtain from 100 to 200 F2 flies.

Drosophila have been very intensively studied by
geneticists who have tested the recombination
properties of hundreds of their genes. Four linkage
groups have been established for Drosophila
melanogaster, and, based on these, many tests might
be made by students who become seriously inter-
ested in genetics. A booklet on the subject is
“Drosophila Guide” by M. Demerec and BP.

ton, 1530 P St, N.W., Washington 5, DC. 1969.

The Effect of Optimum Conditions

The breeding of fruit flies clearly demonstrates the

meaning of the word “genotype”: “a type

 

 

 




 

determined by the genetic characters common to a
group”. However, a given genotype may express
itself quite differently in different environments. How
can its most favorable expression be observed? By
giving the best possible food, housing and care to a
family of small animals such as albino mice or rats,
you may be able to increase the size, general condi-
tion or longevity of the offspring as compared with
the purchased parents. Let strudents make
suggestions, based on their observations, on
optimum conditions for small animals.

To test these, several different kinds of nest boxes
with bedding, exercise wheels, cardboard tunnels
and other playthings, and cages may be offered the
animals, and the choice they make observed and re-
corded. Give them several days to explore and
select. Also offer them a wide variety of food and
observe their choices. Try to account for these. Do
they prefer light or dark? Do they choose a balanced
diet? Do they exercise more during the day or during
the night? To prevent the birth of unwanted animals,
segregate the sexes before maturity. Continue to
keep the two groups under conditions you find to be
the best. A Science Fair exhibit may be made
showing the preferences of the animals and the
effect of optimum conditions n their development.

STUDIES AT BOTANICAL AND
ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS

Dr. David J. Rogers, Curator of Economic Botany
at the New York Botanical Garden, suggests the
following projects. He writes:

“The most important tool in the scientist’s posses-
sion is his own observational ability. If the student
does not learn to discern among objects which can
be observed with facility at the macroscopic level, he
certainly will learn nothing staring down the barrel of
a high-powered microscope, for the objects in the
field will be meaningless in terms of comparison.
Therefore, the best techniques to begin with are
observations of commonly occurring objects,
learning what can be determined by intense study of
materials at hand, with little else than the eyes as
tools.”

(The following projects are intended for city
students who do not have the opportunity to
study plant and animal life in the wild; both pre—
suppose the accessibility of a botanical garden
or a zoo.)

1. Exercise to Develop Observational
Ability in the Field of Comparative
Morphology

Have students read carefully the section in
Bailey’s Manual of Cultivated Plants (Liberty H.
Bailey, New York; Macmillian, 1949) on the Mag-
noliaceae (or on any other group of closely related

33

species which happens to be available, such as
cherries, applies, or azaleas). Students should be—
come sufficiently familiar with the terminology used,
either by reference to the glossary of this book or by
using a good dictionary.

Bring the students to the Botanical Garden for a
close look, under the supervision of one of the
Garden staff, at both herbarium material of the culti—
vated Magnolias, and the living specimens growing
on the grounds. The students are to identify the
living specimens, having recourse to Bailey’s
Manual. (It will help if each student has his own copy
of the appropriate section of the book.) The purpose
is to judge his ability to read from a text, and find
sufficient material on the specimen to help him reach
a conclusion concerning the species, its name,
general characteristics, etc. No student will find all
the parts of the plants described in the manual at any
one time during the year. For example, the keys in
the Manual may call for some flower characteristic,
and the tree will be beyond the flowering stages.
Nevertheless, the student may still progress through
the keys, playing hunches, using his observational
abilities to “second-guess” what characteristics are
and proceed with identification.

The student, after some study, will see that the
collection has both species and species hybrids. He
will be able to see the actual results of hybridization
by comparing the parent species of the collection
with the hybrid offspring.

The teacher should, of course, make a preliminary
study of the plants himself, and also familiarize him-
self with the regulations of the Garden.

11. Further Observations of
Hybridization at the Zoo

Dr. Rogers writes, “So much of introductory
genetics is taught using Mendel’s pea plants that the
students may get the idea that this law applies only
to pea plants, and has little to do with all living
organisms. . . There are probably several examples of
hybridization at the zoo, and reference to the 200’s
curator of education and/or information will
probably be profitable here. For example, in New
York an outstanding example of hybridization and its
effects may be seen in the monkey house. Here one
may observe the male of one species, the female of
another and the F1 hybrid of the two.”

Let the students observe hybrid specimens at the
zoo and compare the hybrid specimens with the
specimens of the parent species. While stressing that
it would be impossible to draw any general conclu-
sions from this study because of the insufficient
number of specimens under observation, let the
students see whether they can observe and record
any behavioral differences among the parent
specimens and the young. Are there any behavioral
features to be observed in the young which seem to
resemble the characteristic behavior of one or the
“other of the parents?

WEATHER EFFECTS ON PLANT LIFE
By Kenneth M. Nagler

Former Director of Space Operations
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration

We all know that weather has profound effects on
plant and animal life; but weather is made up of
many different elements, elements that are always
changing. Precipitation, temperature, humidity,
wind, and cloud cover can all change significantly in
a period of a few hours or even a few minutes. All
are subject to diurnal change and in most areas can
change greatly from one day to the next.

Except in the tropics, major changes occur with
the different seasons. Then, of course, there are the
differences in atmospheric influences in different
places—even, for example, on slopes facing in
different directions in the same field. Also,
showery-type rainfall can differ greatly between a
weather station and a field a few miles away.

In a greenhouse or even in front of a window, you
could test the effect of different amounts of “rain” on
the rate of growth and condition of plants in different
containers, or you could test the effect of giving the
same total amount to all your containers but by
giving some an equal share of water each day and
others larger amounts at less frequent intervals.

With or without watering the soil, you could
simulate the effect of dew, by means of a fine spray
on the leaves each morning on some samples but
not on others.

In experiments of this kind, you should document
carefully the temperatures, humidities, and any other
conditions that might have an effect on the growth of
the plants. Such documentation might help explain
anomalous results, and it would make it possible for
you or others to repeat the experiment under similar
conditions.

Another way to test for the effects of one weather
element—temperature—on plant or animal develop-
ment would be to repeat an experiment a number of
times with exposure to the naturally occurring
outside temperatures. For this experiment, choose a
form of plant life that matures or passes through
identifiable stages within a few days or weeks. Many
plants, bacterial cultures, molds and fungi, have brief
enough life cycles so that the temperature effects
outside can be studied in this way. Life forms that
remain dormant when kept cool or that do not grow
until they get sufficient moisture are the easiest to
use for this type of experiment. The container should
have light, moisture, and food appropriate for the
particular species and should be protected from the
effects of strong wind and rain. In early spring, for
example, a new batch of the life form to be studied
could be started each week, its development

34

watched and documented each day until it
completed the part of the life cycle under study.
Keep careful records of the temperature and other
conditions that might possibly have an impact on the
growth. ’A maximum-minimum thermometer is
useful for such experiments. The average of the
day’s maximum and minimum temperatures is a
good measure of the average daily temperature; thus
readings from a maximum-minimum thermometer
made every day may suffice for the temperature
data.

Note that if you miss a few temperature
observations, you can approximate the missing
observations by using the data from the nearest
weather station—with a correction factor. For those
observations you have, for example, you might
determine that your minimum temperature was on
the average 5 degrees higher than that of the nearest
weather station and your maximum temperature 2
degrees lower. Apply such corrections to the
weather station temperatures to estimate your
missing values, and use these in your study. Any
such substitution, however, should be explained in
the report on your experiment.

Many studies have been made of weather effects
on plant life. The general relationships are known,
and very specific relationships are known for some
plant forms. There are, however, many other plant
forms for which weather-effects studies can be useful
and scientifically interesting.

COLLECTION AND CLASSIFICATION

Projects Concerning Fungi

Fungi, like animals, must have organic food to
nourish them. They cannot make food out of air,
water and minerals as the green plants do by photo-
synthesis. They have developed a variety of
enzymes for the digestion of various types of ma-
terials on which they grow.

Project: Collect and display as many kinds offungi
as you can. For example, different kinds of:

Molds

Bread mold, mold that grows on jam, mold that
grows on damp leather.

Mushrooms

These can best be found after a rain in fields and
woods from June to October. Take a basket to put

 

 

 




 

the mushrooms in. Put each mushroom you collect
in a paper bag or box or separate it from others with
leaves and sticks. If you find samples of the same
mushroom in different stages of growth, bring one of
each. When still in the button stage, the whole mush-
room may be seen by slicing it vertically in two.

Make spore prints of the mature mushrooms by
placing them, gill side down, on a piece of white
paper and leaving them there until the spores drop.
Make drawings or photographs of the whole mush-
room and of the place where you found it. You may
find a “fairy ring”, that is, a circle of mushrooms.
Lepiola molybdites and Marasmius oreades often
form rings. The former is poisonous to eat. Some
fairy rings have been estimated to be 300 to 400
years old. Read about mushrooms in the library to
find out why.

Identify each of the mushrooms you brought back.
The “Field Book of Common Mushrooms” by
William Sturgis Thomas, MD. (Putnam’s Sons, New
York 1948) has a good key which makes identifica-
tion easy.

Make an exhibit of your spore prints, drawings and
photographs.

Lichens

These plants are really two kinds of plants so
closely dependent upon one another that it was only
within the past century that it was learned that they
are alga and fungus living together. This interde—
pendence is called “symbiosis”. The algae give the
green or blue-green color to the lichen.

Collect samples of different lichens and examine
them under the microscope. Can you tell the
difference between fungus and alga? What does the
alga give the fungus? What does the fungus give the
alga?

Uses of lichens: Lichens were much used for dyes
in ancient times. Lichen acid produces the dye. Try
to extract the dye by use of an alkali. Try dyeing a
piece of wool cloth and a piece of cotton cloth with
the dye you extract. Which kind of cloth takes the
dye?

Lichens break down rocks, developing them
through a slow process into soil on which other
plants can grow. How do they do this? To what
extent is this changing of inorganic material into food
for living Organisms unique?

Lichens are the main food of reindeer and their
American counterparts, the caribou. They are very
slow-growing, but the feeding habits of reindeer and
caribou are such that they travel long distances while
feeding, taking only a small bit here and there as they
move along. It is good conservation practice. Why?
What would happen if the animals stayed in one
place and ate all the lichen there?

Reports from Canada indicate that where millions
of caribou used to range, there are now only about

35

200,000 caribou left. Many Eskimo tribes which had
supported themselves for countless generations on
caribou have had to be transported to the seaside by
the Canadian government to prevent them from
dying of starvation. Try to find out why this has
happened. Write to conservation organizations and
to the Canadian government. Read Arctic Wild, by
Lois Crisler. Westminster, Md. Ballantine Press,
1973.

See if you can find lichens: (1) on trees in the
country; 2) on trees in a large city.

Some observers have concluded that pollution of
city air with industrial and automobile fumes creates
an unfavorable environment for lichens. What
evidence can you find to diSpute or substantiate this
claim?

Mycetozoa or Mycomycetes

The question is whether these are plants or
animals. “Mycetozoa” means “fungus-animals”;
“mycomycetes” means “slime molds”. Consult the
encyclopedia or other reference books to learn about
their strange life-history. Try to collect a sample on a
field trip. If you cannot do so, purchase Physarum
polycephalum from a biological supply house.

Compare the motion of a plasmodium with that of
an amoeba. Give it food in the form of mushroom or
other fungus. What happens? Observe the shape it
takes. Draw careful pictures to show its appearance
at different times. What is the difference between a
plant and an animal? Why are primitive forms of
plants and animals more difficult to tell apart than
highly organized species? Do you think this form of
life should be classified as plant or animal? Why?

DEVELOPMENT OF FORM

Does Light Play a Role in Plant
Development?

In three pots of sand or earth, plant one or several
kinds of seeds (oat, pea, bean, corn, etc.). The three
pots should be as nearly identical as possible. (Seeds
will sprout more quickly if soaked overnight in
water.)

Place one pot in a location where the emerging
seedlings will be exposed to sunlight, the second pot
in a shaded location, and the third in complete
darkness. (The seedlings, although unable to
manufacture food in darkness, will live for some
time on food stored in the seed.)

After two or three weeks compare the seedlings of
the three pots as to stem length, stem consistency or
strength, leaf size, leaf color, etc.

This experiment will demonstrate that light is
necessary for “normal” plant development (and for
the formation of chlorophyll).

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Does a Growing Leaf Expand Equally
As It Enlarges?

Select a young leaf of a plant such as morning
glory, tobacco or coleus. Using a centimeter ruler,
India ink and a fine brush, place on the leaf a series
of equidistant dots of known distance apart. The
number of dots will vary with the size of the leaf
selected.

When the leaf has expanded, measure the
distance apart of all these markings. Are they still
equidistant? If not. in what part of the leaf has the
greatest expansion occurred?

Will Sections of Willow Twigs Regenerate
Roots at Either Cut End or at One End
Only, Irrespective of Their Orientation?

Select two willow twigs 12 or more inches in
length and cut at each end. Results will be more
striking if the twigs are in winter condition.

Cut each piece in half as indicated below.

Apical end A D "
E
Basal end C F

Place sections AB and BC in normal orientation
on moist cotton or blotting paper in a moist chamber
(glass jar) with water in the bottom. Invert DE and
E—F and place similarly.

In each case, roots will emerge from the original
basal portion demonstrating polarity of the stem due
perhaps to a gradient in concentration of food
substances or hormones. Notice that the upper cut
surface or its environs of B and E produces roots, the
lower cut surface at B and E does not.

Observe also the development of stem branches
from the lateral buds.

Plants in Medicine

A surprising variety of plants has been used as remedies over the
years. A botanical collection of some of these plants showing which
are still in use and which have been discarded would make an in-
teresting Science Fair exhibit. A useful publication for such a
collection is: A Guide to Medicinal Plants oprpalachia (Agricul-
tural Handbook No. 400) Issued by the US. Forest Service, March
197]. Available through the Government Printing Ofﬁce. Wash-
ington. DC. 20402.

PLANT TRANSPIRATION AND GROWTH
By Karl Niklas,
The New York Botanical Garden

Photosynthesis, the process whereby plants
manufacture carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and
water with the aid of chlorophyll and sunlight,
requires the exchange of gases. Stomata (small
pores scattered over the surface of most plants) are
structures which regulate the rate of gas exchange
and, therefore, play an important role in plant
growth by affecting photosynthetic rates. Water
vapor is lost by the plant during periods when
stomata are open and photosynthesis is actively
occurring. Excessive water loss will cause dehydra-
tion of the plant tissues, and unless stomata close
(thereby stopping photosynthesis) plants will die.
The project outlined has as its primary objective the
determination of various factors in the environment
which dictate the rate of water loss and thereby affect
photosynthetic rates and plant growth. While the
nature of these experiments is very simple, the
phenomena described are fundamental to plant
physiology and crop management.

PROCEDURE: A potometer must first be con-
structed; this device measures the amount of water
which leaves a plant. All that is needed to construct
this device is a calibrated 20 ml pipet, some rubber
tubing, and a ringstand with clamps. Attach to the
tapered tip of the pipet a 2—3 inch length of rubber
tubing, and attach the pipet (in the horizontal
position) to the ring stand. This device will be used to
hold the plant and calibrate its rate of water loss.
Some living plants are required (preferably Coleus, a
very common house plant) for these experiments; at
the conclusion of the experiments they may be
vegetatively propagated, and thus no living thing will
be destroyed needlessly. Allow a gallon of tap water
to “rest” overnight -- this allows the excess dissolved
air in the water to escape, in the form of many
bubbles along the sides of the container. Pour the
water into 3—4 inch deep trays and place the pipet
with rubber tubing under the water’s surface. Make
sure a complete column of water is in the pipet and
tube. You must now attach the cut end (cut with a
sharp razor) of the plant’s stem to the rubber tubing
without allowing any interruption , in the water.
column going from the pipet to the leaves of the
plant. This is the most critical phase of the
preparation, and success or failure of all experiments
will rest on this phase of preparation. Place the cut
end of the plant stem under water, making sure not
to wet the leaves excessively; make another slanted
cut about an inch above the first, through the plant
stem, while it is under water, and be sure that the cut
end of the plant never breaks the water surface.‘
Then by means of a rubber band and some vaseline,
seal the cut end of the plant (which has been inserted
into the rubber tubing) so that the water will not leak
out, or the plant become dislodged. Slowly bring the
entire apparatus out from the water and attach the

 

 

 




 

 

plant in an upright stance. The pipet will make a right
angle with the plant stem, and the rubber tubing will,
by bending, make the right angle (see fig. 1). If you
are successful, the water in the pipet will form an
uninterrupted column with the water in the
conducting tissues of the plant. Water loss by the
leaves will be registered by movement of the pipet
meniscus. Since the pipet is calibrated in ml, you can
plot the number of mls lost per unit time.

EXPERIMENTS: The design of your experiment can
now be directed towards those factors which
influence water loss, i.e., wind, temperature, relative
humidity, and light intensity. With the aid of a small
(low voltage) hair dryer and a sun lamp you can
manipulate your “environments” so as to simulate
natural ecological relationships. For example, direct
a steady but slow stream of cool air over the plant’s
leaves and plot on a graph the rate of water loss, in
this environment. If a lot or planted field is available,
you may even wish to calibrate water loss among
other plants which are densely packed together. As
long as your calibration procedure is repeated in the
same manner each time you take a reading, you will
be deriving useful and relevant data.

DISCUSSION: Stomata, which are small pores in
the leaves of many plants, are flanked by two large
epidermal cells termed the guard cells. Water loss in
these cells causes them to bend in such a way that
the-pore is closed, stopping further water loss. Thus,
water loss through the plant’s leaves, and water
absorption through the plant’s roots effectively make
a “feedback system” whereby the photosynthetic
rate is indirectly determined. Plants which are water
“starved” or wilted haVe closed stomata and
photosynthetic rates are low or non-existent. If you
have performed your phototranspiration experi-
ments correctly you may observe a very sudden
change in the shape of your graph, i.e., a leveling off
of water loss, and then a cessation. If your graphs

37

indicate an abrupt stopping in water loss, then you
have derived experimental evidence for stomatal
closure. Intense heat, or rapidly moving air may also
cause stomatal closure, while a relatively high
humidity would provide a condition favoring
stomata remaining open. What effect does a high
water vapor pressure in the atmosphere have on
stomatal opening and closing? What are the effects
of densely packing together many plants on water
loss, and how does this relate to the natural
ecosystem of plants in fields or in cultivated areas? A
very long list of relevant questions relating the
environment to these and related experiments may
be checked against the theory of stomatal functions.

BACTERIOLOGY

 

SUGGESTIONS FOR EXPERIMENTS IN
BACTERIOLOGY FOR INTRODUCTORY
BIOLOGY CLASSES AND

STUDENT PROJECTS

The following experiments, which were compiled
by the Committee on Education of the American
Society for Microbiology, are included in this manual
with the kind permission of Dr. L. S. McLung, former
Chairman of the Committee.

Infusion for Microscopic Examination
or as Source of Cultures of Bacteria

Place small amount of hay, black or red pepper
(about a third of a teaspoon) in a tumbler of tap
water, cover, and let stand at room temperature (or
prepare several and incubate at different tempera-
tures). Prepare others with dried beans (slightly
cooked or raw) in water or slices of white potato.
Examine microscopically (wet mount or stained
smears) at 1—2 day intervals beginning at 48 hours.
Probably you will note a succession of populations—
bacteria first and then protozoa feeding on the
bacteria. Variation: Add small amount of mud to
infusion or use local pond water instead of tap water.

Demonstration of Bacterial Spores

Using agar slant cultures of species of Bacillus (use
named cultures or isolates from air or soil plates) or
old hay infusions make stained smears using dilute
crystal violet stain. Spores will stain only in “outline”
and vegetable cells will stain throughout the cell.

Isolation of Pure Cultures

Use flamed inoculating loop to streak plates of
sterile nutrient or other agar with hay or other
infusions as inoculum. Transfer to broth and replate.
How many different (on basis of colony mor-
phology) species can be isolated from the same
sample of infusion? or from a single air exposure
plate? or plate of dilution of soil?

Air Exposure Plates

Expose different plates for same time period (15
minutes for example) of nutrient agar in various
locations: class laboratory in early morning and in
late afternoon, cafeteria at meal time, corridors
before and after class change period, out of doors, in
gymnasium, etc. Incubate at room temperature 2—5
days. Is there a correlation between colony count
and room activity?

38

Gram Stain Technique

Isolate or obtain pure cultures of different bacteria
(soil, sewage, plant materials, air exposure, saliva,
etc.) and stain by Gram’s method (Manual of Micro-
biological Methods or text book). Determine
antibiotic sensitivity and discuss correlation.

Media Preparation

Consult Manual of Microbiological Methods,
McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1957, or a textbook of
bacteriology for formula of nutrient broth and
nutrient agar. Obtain materials and prepare media as
directed. Variation: Prepare infusions (heat for a few
minutes and strain through cloth and/or paper-towel
or filter paper) of white potato, white beans, dried
hay, hamburger (lean meat is better) or other ma-
terials and compare the nutritive value of these with
“standard” media. Include coffee or other material
likely to contain inhibitory compounds for
comparison.

Try slices of carrots, white and yellow potatoes,
etc. Clean with stiff brush and water, dry, cut with
flamed knife, and place slice in sterile Petri dish.
Inoculate with pure culture or expose to air.

Demonstration of Bacteria In Mouth

To observe microscopically, make smear of tartar
with tooth pick and stain (or make negative stain
with India ink) with crystal violet and examine with
oil immersion lens or make suspension in tap water
and, using cover slip preparatiOn, examine with
high-dry lens. For project, if Journal of Dental
Research is available, have student look up
references on media and methods for determination
of numbers of lactobacilli and do project with
possible correlation with caries.

Simple Staining Solutions for Bacteria

If oil immersion lens is available (if not, ask local
MD. or hospital for loan), try various colored solu-
tions for substitutes for usual bacterial stains. Try:
washable and permanent ink of various colors,
vegetable (textile) dyes in various concentrations,
mercurichrome, colored juices of various berries, etc.
For “standard” use solution of dilute crystal violet or
methylene blue.

Effect of Temperature on Bacterial Growth

Using pure cultures of known bacteria (or ones
isolated from air exposure plates), inoculate 3 sets of

 




 

 

tubes of nutrient broth and/or nutrient agar slants
and incubate at 37 C (incubator), 25—30 C (room).
5 C (refrigeration) or other temperatures. Keep
record of relative amount of growth for 3—7 days.

Effect of Antiseptic and
Antibiotic Compounds

Using plates seeded with pure cultures of various
bacteria, add sterile filter paper disks (purchase a
sterile disk or cut from filter paper and sterilize in
oven) which have been dipped (and drained) in
various common antiseptic (or claimed to be) solu-
tions. Record extent of zone of inhibition (if present)
following incubation.

Purchase antibiotic disks and substitute for paper
disks mentioned above.

Use of Heat for Killing of Bacteria

Inoculate 2 sets of several tubes of nutrient broth
using known spore forming type in one set and non-
spore former in other set. Place tubes in pan of water
and maintain at 60 C, reserving one tube from each
set unheated (control). Withdraw one tube from
each set at successive time periods, cool and
incubate. Record length of time required to prevent
growth if endpoint was determined. Discuss, indicat-
ing importance of spores: food preservation, dental
and surgical materials, etc.

Plate Count Analysis of Soil

Make dilution counts of soils of different types
(clay, sandy, loam, etc.) from various locations.
Incubate 7—15 days at room temperature. Is there a
correlation between numbers of colonies per gram
and type of soil?

Demonstration of Exoenzymes

Streak across center of duplication plates of 0.2%
glucose, 0.5% gelatin nutrient agar from tube of
yeast suspension (10 gm. yeast cake in 100 ml.
water) or various pure cultures of bacteria including
members of following genera: Bacillus, Pseudo-
monas, Proteus, etc. Incubate (room temperature)
some plates for 24 and others for 48 hours. Flood
plates with (1) 1% tannic, or (2) acid mercuric
chloride (HgCl 15 g., conc. HCI 20 ml., water 100
ml). Tannic acid does not precipitate protein but
does precipitate protein breakdown products
(peptides, peptones, amino acids). Therefore, the
area around the streak shows precipitate or the
presence of breakdown products, whereas the re-
mainder of the flooded plate is clear. Mercuric
chloride precipitates protein and a clear area around
the streak indicates that the culture hydrolyzed the
protein (gelatin) so that there was none with which
the mercuric acid could react.

39

Library Problem on
History of Bacteriology

Have students prepare list of dates of importance
relating to bacteriology (discovery, germ theory, pure
culture techniques, discovery of etiological agents of
disease, discovery of named antibiotics, etc). Chart
in chronological list.

Discovery of Antibiotic Producing
Molds and Actinomycetes

Isolate in pure culture a number of strains of
Penicillium and Streptomyces from air exposure, soil
dilution, spoiled fruit, etc. Use antagonist test culture
method for demonstration of antibiosis. Alternate
method: grow possible antagonist in shallow layer of
liquid medium, dip filter paper squares (sterilize in
oven) in liquid after 5—7 days, place squares on,
surface of agar seeded with staphylococcus or
bacillus culture isolated from air.

Germ Theory of Disease

Repeat Koch’s postulates using bacterial disease of
plants which may be grown in classroom or solarium
if available.

Chromatography of Bacterial Pigments

Using Serratia marcescens, Sarcina lutea or other
plant infusion, raw milk or other liquid, by determina-
tion of population level per ml using direct smear.
Spread 0.01 ml. vol., or a standard loop, over 1 sq.
cm. on slide (stain smear with dilute crystal violet) or,
if glassware and media supply permit and student
gains proficiency in technique, by quantitative plate
count. Take samples every few hours and prepare
graph with numbers (plot: logarithmic) plotted
against time of sampling. Variation of experiment
would be to incubate similar samples (or pure
cultures) at different temperatures and compare
temperature effects.

Variation for students interested in photoelectric
device; construct photoelectric cell sensitive to small
differences in turbidity and follow population level
(use clear broth and pure culture of organism like
Escherida coli) photometrically.

Nitrogen Cycle: Symbiotic in
Fixing Bacteria

Collect roots, during growing season, of legumes
in area. Observe differences in nodules. Prepare
negative or other stains from crushed nodule. Isolate
pure culture on yeast infusion mannitol agar and
using chemically sterilized seeds, and heat sterilized
soil, try artificial inoculation routine to demonstrate
cross inoculation groups.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Spore Germination in Molds

Streak clear agar plate (or use glass spreader) with
spores of Penicillium or Aspergillus (isolate from air)
and locate spores with high power objective. Follow
germination and formation of microcolony by
examination, after 6—8 hours, at 2-hour intervals.

Slide Cultures of Molds
To Observe Spore Formation

lnoculate lightly, from spore suspension of molds
as Penicillium or Aspergillus, a small amount of
sterile heat liquefied potato infusion agar in a tube
and, with sterile pipette, place drop on each of
several flamed slides. Press cover slip down on a
drop and seal 3 sides with wax. Observe spore
germination, filament formation, and eventual spore
production of molds as growth extends beyond drop
into area near unsealed side. (Incubate slides at
room temperature, 24—30 C, in small screw cap jar
containing piece of moistened blotter.)

Sexual Spore Production in Molds

Learn characteristics of molds that reproduce
sexually as Rhizopus and Mucor. Isolate 25 strains
which appear to be similar. Inoculate each of two
strains by Single streak about 1 inch apart on plate of
potato infusion medium. Incubate several days and
observe for zygospore production. Try a number of
random combinations.

Cellulose Decomposition

Using finely divided filter paper (Waring blendor
or ball mill) added to agar or strips of filter paper in
liquid media, demonstrate cellulose decomposition
by adding (or plating dilutions) samples of soil,
rotting wood, sewage, intestinal contents of termites,
beetles, cockroaches, etc.

Simulated Epidemic

Divide class in groups of about 5 and have each
handle separate piece of candy one of which has
been dipped in culture of Serratia marcescens.
Before handling candy each student should rub
finger tips of right hand across surface of nutrient
agar plate before and after washing. Use 3rd dish to
rub from tips after handling candy. Set up routine of
handshaking such that each member of team shakes
hands with each other member (keep record of
order) and rub fingers across new plate after each
hand shake. Incubate plates 24—48 hours and trace
the spread of the Serratia culture. (See section VII,
Topic C., expt. 7, p. 833 of NAS-NRC Laboratory
and Field Studies in Biology, Holt, Rinehart and
Winston, NY.)

40

Exhibit Case Display Letters, Figures, Etc.

Using small sterile cottonswab dipped in liquid
culture of Serratia, Sarcina or other pigmented
organisms, spell out, using one letter per plate,
MERRY CHRISTMAS FROM THE BACTERIA,
THE BACTERIA SAY BEAT CENTERVILLE, or
other seasonally appropriate words for use in display
booths. Figures, positive or negative, may be made
by inoculating entire surface of plate with liquid
culture with swab or glass spreader and then
exposing plate to ultraviolet light with figure or other
design cut out of paper or heavy foil.

Virus Studies

Samples of frozen tobacco leaves infested with
tobacco mosaic virus or dried infected leaves can be
obtained from many Universities or Agricultural
Experiment Stations. Macerate infected leaf material
with distilled water in a mortar. Dust seedling leaves
with fine carborundum powder and, using fingers,
smear the liquid over the leaves, rinse leaves with
water. Observe plant for development of mosaic
symptoms. Tomato seedlings can be used as the test
plant in these experiments.

Identification of Fungi

Prepare pure cultures of common sporulating
fungi from air exposure plates, soil dilution plates, or
spoiled (“moldy”) fruit or vegetables. Identify by
using a microscope equipped with ocular and stage
micrometers. For classification, consult keys of: (1)
Illustrated Genera of Imperfect Fungi, Barnett,
Horace L. and Hunter, Barry. Burgess Publishing
Co., Minneapolis, 1972. (2) Gilman, J. C., A Manual
of Soil Fungi, 2nd ed., Iowa State University Press,
Ames, Iowa, 1957.

Mouth Flora

Rinse mouth with 10 ml sterile water and expell in
sterile tube. Make aerobic plate count using dilutions
of 1—100,000 and 1—1,000,000. Brush teeth and
repeat mouth rinsing with new sample of water and
repeat count. Repeat count after 1 hour. Reduction
of 50% at most may be expected. Discuss this with
class considering (a) advertising on 50% reduction,
etc, and (b) generation time of bacteria.

Invertase Production by Yeast

To 100 ml of 20% sucrose solution add 20 grams
of pressed yeast. After 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 hours remove 10
ml and filter. Run Fehling’s test (purchase Fehling
solution at drug store) by boiling 2.5 ml of yeast-
sucrose solution with 2.5 ml. Fehling’s solution.
Formation of copper precipitate in 1, 2, etc., hour

 




 

samples versus none at 0 hour indicates formation of
reducing sugars (glucose and fructose) from sucrose
by invertase activity of yeast.

Production of Mutations

With glass spreader, spread the same amount of a
dilution of culture of Serratia marcescens on surface
of several nutrient agar plates such that about
200-250 colonies develop. Leave one untreated as
control and expose remainder to ultra—violet light for
various time periods. Observe correlation, if any,
with time of exposure and reduction in number of
colonies. For colonies on exposed plates, examine to
see if there is gross change in pigmentation. Establish
pure cultures from each colony on plate with most
exposure and study metabolic reactions of cultures
and compare with reactions of parent strain. Have
any characteristics besides pigmentation been
changed? (Note: Some strains of Serratia are
relatively stable and others quite unstable. The
experiment may be done with other species,
pigmented or non-pigmented.)

Determination of Blood Types

Using known samples of Anti-A and Anti-B serum,
have students determine type of their blood and
prepare chart of results from class to determine
frequency of blood groups. For details consult
Morholt, Brandwein, and Joseph Sourcebook for the
Biological Sciences, 2nd ed. (Teaching Science
Series, Harcourt Brace, 1966) or standard text of
immunology.

Recovery of Bacteria from
Eating and Drinking Utensils

Using various eating and drinking utensils before
and after hand or machine washing, swab utensils
with sterile cotton swabs (“Q-tip” swabs obtained at
pharmacies) and make plate counts before and after
washing the utensils. This exercise presupposes an
exercise on the plate count of water, milk or soil.

Effects of Spices and
Condiments on Bacteria

Develop a laboratory exercise or demonstration to
show the positive and negative effects of such
materials as garlic, onion, horseradish, red pepper,
chili powder, cloves, lemon oil, vanilla, etc, on
bacteria. This may be accomplished by preparing a
series of agar cups in a plate seeded with some test
organism. Sterile stainless steel or ceramic rings may
be used in place of agar cups. The spices or
condiments should be triturated, an aqueous
suspension prepared and aliquots placed in the agar
cups or rings.

41

Relation of Human Carriers
to Food Contamination

Using sterile “Q-tip” cotton swabs, collect
specimens from the nose, throat, and hands of
students. Prepare total counts on plate count agar or
streak on blood agar plates. Swabs of some part of
the hand may be taken before and after washing the
hands to show reduction in numbers by hand
washing and disinfection.

Bacteriological Examination of Ice

Supply several students with sterile containers for
the collection of samples of ice from their home
refrigerators. In addition, ice samples might be
collected from the school cafeteria and nearby eating
establishments. The ice should be melted and a
bacteriological analysis made of the water.

Flannel Graphs

Make flannel graphs to demonstrate bacterial cell
shapes, cell division, and shape and location of
spores, etc.

Methylene Blue Reduction Time in Milk

Prepare dilute solution of methylene blue (about
1:200,000). Using samples of raw and pasteurized
milk in sterile test tubes with rubber stoppers, add
sufficient dye to give faint blue color. Record time of
disappearance of blue color (preferably incubate
tubes in waterbath at 37 C and invert tubes at half
hour intervals). If possible, make plate (dilution)
counts of samples at beginning of experiment and
determine correlation with initial colony count and
time of reduction (to stage where milk is without
color).

Sanitary Analysis of Water

Consult text or reference book for method of
analysis of water using lactose broth for detection of
coliform bacteria as indicator of fecal pollution. Test
local water supply at various stages in purification
process.

Study Our Water Supply

The problem of having reasonably pure water for
our own uses, for our plants, and for our animals is
becoming increasingly difficult and more expensive
due almost entirely to the fact that we are following
the age-old practice of using our waterways as
convenient dumping grounds or sewers for our
wastes. Many communities will have problems that
are very similar. However, some other communities

 

 




 

 

 

will have very different problems; and there will be
some variation between all of the problems.

We need to revise our thinking and not throw the
burden of purifying Nature’s pure water on to the
people who are down stream but rather to throw the
burden of purifying the water on those who pollute
it.

Students can observe streams, see whether or not
they are muddy from soil that is being eroded from
lands because of bad agricultural practices, whether
or not fish or other animals are being killed, and
whether or not the plant life that is normal to the
water has been killed by the many different types of
chemicals such as detergents that are used in the
home, those that are dumped into the streams by
chemical plants, or other industries. From these
observations, a great number of excellent and useful
projects can be evolved.

It should be borne in mind that organic wastes will
ordinarily be purified by bacterial or plant action
unless the bacteria or plants are killed by chemicals.
All of these factors are of vital concern to all of us
because many of them are undoubtedly affecting our
health today.

Photographic Study of Bacteria

For students with photographic equipment and
ability, take pictures of bacterial colonies from air
exposure or other plates; or, with microscope,
pictures of bacterial cells following special staining
techniques. For references consult books on
photography, the brochures of Eastman Kodak Co.,
etc. See also such references as: Eisenstart, A. and
Eisenstark, R. Photography of Biological Materials
Without a Camera. Journal Biological Photographic
Association Vol. 21, No. 4 (November 1953), pp.

Effect of Temperature on Fermentation

Using 5% sugar solution in Smith fermentation
tube, inoculate several tubes with equal amount of
yeast (yeast cake or pure culture of Saccharomyces).
Incubate at different temperatures (refrigerator,
room temperature, incubator at 37° C or 980 F, slow
oven at 1210 C or 250° F). Observe at different time
intervals and construct graph to show amount of gas
produced at each incubation temperature. Discuss in
relation to: (A) influence of temperature on biologi-
cal systems, or (B) application to bread making.

Microbial Populations in Natural
Fermentations

Place unpasteurized cider (or purple grape juice)
in bottle and incubate at cool room temperature.
Note gross changes and examine microscopically
approximately daily for about two weeks. What
conclusions can be made concerning the develop-
ment and changes in the microbial populations?
Compare with population changes in (A) hay
infusions, (B) unpasteurized milk.

Molding of Foods

Collect various fresh foods and place in covered
dishes with moistened paper towel for humidifier.
Observe spoilage rates in different foods. lnoculate
some with mold spores and compare with
uninoculated.

In experiments with bacteria from such sources as
polluted water, strict procedures to prevent any
possible spread of infection must be used. Demon-
strations such as the “Simulated Epidemic”, (page
14) will help to impress students with the importance
of using sterile procedures and washing hands
thoroughly. The teacher must make sure that the
students understand the possibility of contagion if
suitable precautions are not taken.

 




 

 

PHYSIOLOGY

 

PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS
AND DEMONSTRATIONS

An Experiment to Measure the Effects
of Heat and Chemical Stimuli on the
Locomotion of the Amoeba or the
Paramecium

1. Individual amoebas can be examined in culture
fluid on a glass microscope slide under a cover slip
which is supported by a ring of vasoline. Using such
a technique, it is possible to examine these protozoa
using oil immersion objectives.

Warm and chill the prepared slide. Observe the
effect on the speed and amount of locomotion. Note
that locomotion is a basic characteristic of living
protoplasm; even unicellular animals respond to
changes of temperature with modification of
movement.

ll. Paramecia can be used to demonstrate the
effect of weak chemicals on ciliary action. Many
chemicals cause paramecia to reverse the beat of the
cilia so that the whole organism backs up. Students
may ascertain the threshold concentrations of
chemicals necessary to bring about this reaction.
Mount the paramecium in the same way as the
amoeba was mounted in I. Add a drop of the
chemical chosen, in solution. For example: dilute
acids, alkalis, salts of calcium, magnesium, sodium
and potassium, dilute alcohol, sucrose, urea,
ammonia. If there is no reaction, add further drops of
the solution until a reaction is obtained; if there is
reaction, repeat the experiment with another slide
and a weaker solution until the threshold
concentration of the chemical required to produce
the reaction is determined.

An Experiment to Determine
the Growth Curve of Protozoa

This experiment is designed to illustrate one of the
fundamental characteristics of growth in all
organisms; the sigmoid nature of the growth curve.

Inoculate a tube of culture medium with a few
paramecia or other protozoa. Measure the growth of
the population every day. A means of measuring the
population would be to take a small sample of the
culture and put it on a hemocytometer (the
instrument which is used commonly in hospital
laboratories to estimate the number of blood cells in
human blood). The number of organisms per cubic
centimeter of culture could then be estimated quite
closely. If it is impossible to get access to a
hemocytometer, a microscopic count of several
“standard” drops of the solution would provide an
indication of population density.

43

If there is difficulty in measuring the number of
free swimming protozoa in the culture tube, it may be
preferable to use a yeast culture. Ordinary brewers or
bakers yeast can be used. Grow it in a solution of
sugar and water. The increase in number of cells can
be measured by volume, or, from time to time, the
cultures can be dried, and the actual increase in the
amount of protoplasm can be measured by weight.

Let the mathematics department‘of your school
cooperate by demonstrating how rates of growth can
be expressed mathematically, how they .can be
graphed, and how equations can be written for the
curve which results. The curve obtained will
eventually be sigmoid, as was mentioned above, and
the experiment should not be discontinued until
finally a levelling off of the population occurs.

An Experiment to Determine the Effect of
Heat on the Growth Rates of Protozoa

(This experiment may be conducted simultane-
ously with the above, using the same material, and
the same methods of measurement.)

Subject several cultures to different temperatures.
If it is possible to maintain even temperatures for
days on end, prolong the experiment, and record the
results by making a growth curve for each
temperature. If it is not possible to maintain a variety
of even temperatures over a period of time, we
recommend the use of yeast cells, which, of course,
multiply with great rapidity. Keep cultures of yeast at
a selection of four or five different temperatures for a
few hours, and construct a graph showing the
relative increase in volume of four identical
quantities of yeast culture during a given time at the
various selected temperatures. Observe the optimum
growth temperature for yeast.

An Experiment to Determine the
Effect of Certain Chemicals on the
Growth Rate of Yeast

(This experiment may be conducted simultane-
ously with the above.)

Raise a number of cultures of yeast at the same
temperature, taking care to make them as nearly
identical as possible. Add to each a small quantity of
a different chemical whose effect on the growth of
yeast you wish to determine. For example, sodium
chloride, one or more of the water soluble vitamins,
gibberellic acid, colchicine, plant growth hormones.
Compare the growth of the various cultures of yeast,
and of a control culture which has not been
chemically treated. Compile a chart showing the
relative beneficial or noxious effects of the chemicals
you have tried.

 




An Experiment in Measuring the Growth
Patterns of Bean Sprouts, Designed

to Illustrate the Importance of
Quantitative Observation

Grow a number of bean sprouts under varying
conditions. For example, darkness, ultraviolet light, a
variety of chemicals, fertilizers, weed-killers, and the
like in the water, a variety of soils, a variety of
temperatures, etc. Grow one sprout under each of
the chosen conditions. Measure the sprout at regular
intervals. A way of measuring is the wet string
method. Wet a fine string with water and apply it to
the shoot, following all the curves. Mark and remove
the string: then measure it with a ruler. Record the
data. When this first stage of the experiment has
been completed, repeat it from the beginning, using
ten or more shoots under each condition instead of
one. Average each set of measurements taken under
each condition, and compare the average to the
original measurement taken under the condition.
What variation do you find?

A Demonstration of the Maintenance of

Homeostasis in the Tissue Juices of Plants

An important characteristic of living organisms is
the maintenance of homeostasis. The internal body
fluids are so composed in animals and plants as to
resist change and to keep things in a state of
equilibrium. For example, the blood of animals and
the tissue juices of plants are so buffered as to resist
changes in the hydrogen ion concentration despite
the fact that acids and alkalis of different sorts are
always getting into the circulatory system of either
plants or animals. This can be demonstrated
dramatically and scientifically by using well-strained
orange or lemon juice.

I. Squeeze fresh orange or lemon juice. Strain it,
and then filter it through a fine filter paper to get a
clear fluid. Put the material into a suitable container
and add alkali in the form of sodium carbonate or
sodium hydroxide solution drop by drop. After each
drop, measure the hydrogen ion concentration,
either with a pH meter or with prepared indicator
papers (e.g. “Hydrion” paper). Record these
measurements and prepare a titration curve, which
will show what large quantities of alkali must be
added to change the pH of this biological fluid.
Compare this to the effect of adding similar
quantities of alkali to distilled water, tap water, ocean
water. Cooperation of the mathematics department
may be enlisted in presenting the data.

II. If it is desired to show this same principle with
mammalian blood, the teacher may obtain blood
from a nearby packing house. Since these animals
are being killed for food, the blood is in large part
waste, and this would by a way of using the animals
so killed to the best extent. Most packing houses or
slaughtering houses are quite glad to do this service
for nearby schools. The blood could be brought back
to school, centrifuged and clear serum or plasma

 

44

 

obtained, and this could be titrated with hydroxide or
with acid to show the buffering action of the blood.

An Experiment in Measuring the Effect
of Heat and Chemical Stimuli on the Rate
of Heart Beat in the Water Flea, Daphnia

Daphnia may be mounted live on a microscope
slide, so that under the microscope its heart can be
seen to beat, through the transparent body wall.
Students should be able to count the number of
heart beats per minute.

1. Select a range of temperatures at which to
measure the heart beat. We suggest 4°, 10°, 16°,
21°, 27°, 32° C. Heat or chill a pan of water to the
required temperature, and immerse the Daphnia on
the slide in it until slide and liquid have reached
water temperature. During this process, be sure to
maintain the temperature of the water at the desired
level. Then observe ‘ the Daphnia under the
microscope. Count the number of heart beats per
minute. Repeat the experiment, if it is desirable, with
several different fleas, as a control. Repeat this
procedure for every temperature in the range.
Construct a graph showing the relation of
temperature to the number of heart beats per minute
averaged, to show your findings. Following the
observations replace the water fleas in their
aquarium.

11. Select a number of chemicals whose effect on
the heart beat rate of Daphnia you wish to study.
For example: chloride salt, magnesium sulfate,
potassium chloride, acetyl choline, atropine sulfate,
dilute acids, urea, ammonia. Immerse the Daphnia in
a weak solution of the chosen substance for a few
minutes, then mount it with some of the solution on
a microscope slide; Measure the number of heart
beats per minute. Compare this measurement with
the heart beat rate of a flea in water of the same
temperature as the solution used. Compile a chart to
show the comparative effects of different chemicals
on the rate of heart beat. Replace the Daphnia in
their aquarium.

Living clams of the species Venus, which can be
obtained periodically from most chain markets, may
also be used for Experiment I. The clam should be
chilled and then opened. As the clam warms up, the
heart begins to beat, and the rate of heart beat
increases. Because of the difficulty in measuring the
exact temperature of the clam as it warms, the clam
is more useful for simple demonstration and
observation than for biological recording.

Dr. Charles G. Wilber was kind enough to suggest
to us the above Physiological Experiments and
Demonstrations. These projects are acceptable to the
humanitarian, because they are based on the
substitution of lower for higher forms of life in the
teaching of the fundamental principles of physiology.
These principles are illustrated by the use of forms of
life lacking a highly developed nervous system, and

 

 




 

thus the unnecessary infliction of pain by students in
the laboratory is avoided.

Dr. Wilber’s projects involve chemical measuring
and biological recording; they demand great care
and precision in execution. Stressed are the making
of detailed observations and their careful recording.
A mathematical approach to the organization of
recorded data is suggested. It is hoped that such
projects will serve as an introduction to research
technique. Dr. Wilber feels that, “It is this type of
training that we should stress for high school
students rather than the imprecise and unquantita-
tive aspects of surgical procedures and tumor
implantations.”

PLANT PHYSIOLOGY

A Classic Experiment

Joseph Priestley (1733-1804) was the discoverer
of oxygen, which he called “dephlogisticated air”. He
learned that green plants give off oxygen. Two of his
experiments were as follows:

Place a small growing plant (mint was used by
Priestley) in a glass bell jar or other large glass jar
which is inverted in a pan of water to keep it airtight
and provide water for the plant. After three months,
place a candle in the bell jar. Does it burn well? What
is the reason for this?

Place a candle in a bell jar and let it burn until it
goes. out. Slip a green plant into the jar and let it
grow there for ten days. Now put a burning candle in
again. Does it go out or continue to burn? Why?

Suggested exhibit: Show the effects of green
plants on the earth’s atmosphere. Show various
agencies which remove oxygen from the air
(breathing, burning, operation of combustion
engines) and how the supply of oxygen is renewed.
It has been claimed that increased combustion has
made the climate of some large cities warmer. Would
large parks counteract temperature changes? Why
are parks cooler than streets? Would a candle burn
in the combination of gases which are expelled from
the exhaust pipes of automobiles? Why is it
dangerous to run a motor in a closed garage? What
is the difference between carbon monoxide and
carbon dioxide?

Is Light Necessary for the Manufacture
of Starch (photosynthesis)?

Select a plant with rather smooth leaves such as
the household geranium or the morning glory.
Leave the plant in the dark for 24-48 hours. At the
end of this period, the leaves will be free of starch
which, transformed to sugar, has been transported to
other parts of the plant.

Make a stencil of tinfoil or black paper. Any design
may be used or the letters LIGHT or STARCH may
be cut from the foil or paper. Fasten the stencil to the

45

upper leaf surface. Place the plant in sunlight or
strong artificial light for several hours to all day.

Test for starch:

a. One leaf taken from the plant after it has

been in the dark for 24-48 hours.

b. One leaf which has been completely ex-

posed to light.

c. The leaf to which the stencil was attached.

To test the leaf for starch, boil the leaf in water for
a minute or two. Extract the chlorophyll with hot
alcohol until the leaf is colorless. Since alcohol is
inflammable, the vessel containing alcohol should be
heated in a dish of boiling water. Handle the brittle
leaf carefully. It will soften when placed in water, in
which it should be rinsed several times. Now drop on
it an aqueous solution of iodine. Areas in which
starch was produced (those exposed to light) will
turn purplish black; areas not exposed to light will
remain colorless.

The product of photosynthesis is the soluble sugar,
glucose. The sharpness of the stencil print on the leaf
indicates that there was no diffusion of sugar into leaf
areas not exposed to light and, consequently, that
transformation of soluble glucose to insoluble starch
occurs immediately.

Is Chlorophyll, the Green Pigment of
Plants, Necessary for Starch Formation
(Photosynthesis)?

Use leaves of any white-variegated plant that has
been exposed to sunlight or artificial light for several
hours. Make a diagrammatic sketch of a particular
leaf to show the pattern of green and white areas.
Extract the chlorophyll from the leaf and test the leaf
for starch. Starch will be found only in the areas that
were originally green.

Demonstration of Separation of
Leaf Pigments By the Paper
Chromatography Method

Extract the green-yellow leaf pigments in boiling
95% alcohol. Since alcohol is inflammable the vessel
containing alcohol should be heated in a dish of
boiling water. Any leaves may be used, but spinach is
sure to supply a concentrated dark green extract.

Apply the chlorophyll solution near the base of a
strip of filter paper in a horizontal band. Let this dry
and add more solution. Repeat several times until a
very dark green band has been produced.

Place the base of the strip of filter paper in a

solution of petroleum ether (3 parts) and benzene
(lpart). Acetone may be substituted for benzene, but
the final distribution of pigments will differ from that
given below. After a few minutes, the solution will
rise carrying the pigments to different levels on the

paper

 




 

 

The pigments are:
yellow carotenoids

carotene (more orange)—carried to high-
est level
xanthophyll (lighter yellow)——carried to

second highest level
green chlorophylls
chlorophyll a (blue-green)—carried to third
highest level
Chlorophyll b (yellow—green)—at lowest level
The chlorophylls play an essential role in food
manufacture. The function of the carotenoids always
associated with chlorophyll, is uncertain.

How Do Roots and Stems Respond
to the Stimulus of Gravity?

a. Select two young and rapidly growing plants in
pots (coleus and tomato give good results). Leave
the plants for 48 hours in the dark, one in normal
upright position l(the control), the other placed
horizontally (the experiment).

The upward growth bending of the stem placed
horizontally is a negative response to the stimulus of
gravity (negative geotropism).

b. In a petri dish or between two glass plates. place
moist paper toweling or blotting paper and attach to
it just-sprouted seeds, (pea, oat, corn, or bean, etc),
some with the root extending downward, some with
root extending upward, some with root horizontal.
Put a rubber band about the dish or plates and stand
them upright in a covered jar with a little water. Place
in the dark. After 24-48 hours observe the seedlings.

Roots respond positively to the stimulus of gravity.
As the young shoots emerge, they will respond
negatively. The growth response of plant organs to
the unilateral stimulus of gravity (and also of light)
enables the farmer to scatter seed as he plants, since
in whatever position the seed falls, the root will grow
downward and the stem upward.

How Do Stems Respond to the
Unilateral Stimulus of Light?

0. Observe a potted plant or a pot of seedlings that
has been standing near a window for some time with
the same side of the pot always facing the window.
Notice the direction of growth of the stem and the
orientation of leaves in relation to the direction from
which light comes.

b. Sprout oat seedlings in two small pots of sand.
Before the leaves have broken through the
coleoptile sheath, place one pot in a location where
light comes from above or equally from all sides, the
other in a location where light comes from one side
only. Bending of the coleoptile sheaths toward the
light source can be observed within an hour. This is a
positive growth response (as in “0”) to the unilateral
stimulus of light (positive phototropism).

46

What Is The Effect of Plant Growth
Substances (The Growth Hormones
Known As Auxins) on Root Formation
by Cuttings?

Make stem cuttings of various plants such as
geranium, begonia, and philodendron or leaf
cuttings of African violet.

In one pot or flat of moist sand place untreated
cuttings with tips emerging. In a second, place similar
cuttings, the cut ends of which have been dipped in
hormone powder. Commercial preparations such as
Rootone may be used (obtainable from any seed
store) or pure hormone powders obtainable from
biological supply houses.

After two to six weeks compare root development
in the two sets of cuttings.

What Is the Effect of Gibberellic Acid
on Plant Growth?

Use young plants of coleus, marigold, sweet
alyssum, narcissus, geranium or other species. Dwarf
varieties may be particularly responsive.

Leave a control pot untreated. Apply gibberellic
acid or gibberellin to another pot of the same kind of
plant. Gibberellic acid sprays may be bought at seed
stores. A powdered form for making up stronger
sprays may be purchased from biological supply
houses.

After several weeks compare the plants in the
treated and untreated pots as to size, number of
internodes and any other differences.

Plants arising from seeds that have been soaked in
gibberellic acid solution may be compared with
plants arising from untreated seeds.

What is the Effect of the Removal of
the Apical Bud on the Development
of Lateral Buds?

Select two rapidly growii g young plants. Leave
one intact. From the other, remove the apical
(terminal) bud. After two or nore weeks, compare
the degree of development of the lateral buds on the
two plants.

The grower of plants uses knowledge of the
dominance of the apical over lower buds on the stem
to control plant form. Removal of the apical bud of
the main stem and of subsequently formed branches
produces a low bushy plant with many branches,

What is the effect of Sugar Solutions of
Different Concentrations on Potato
Tissue?

Prepare a series of small dishes or bottles
containing solutions ranging in concentration from
tap water to 20% cane sugar. Cut a rectangular

 

 




 

block of potato. Cut this into slices of about equal
thickness and place several slices in each container.
Note the degree of crispness of these slices at the
start of the experiment.

After several hours, remove the pieces of potato,
blot them lightly, and compare the degree of
crispness.

Those in water will be taut and crisp because water
has passed into the living cells by osmosis. Those in
20% cane sugar solution will be soft and flabby
because water has left the cell vacuoles and passed
by osmosis into the sugar solution. The cells are no
longer turgid but have become plasmolyzed.
Evaporation of water from a plant or plant organ
which cannot draw in water to replace it will have a
similar effect. The plant or organ is said to be wilted.

If the potato tissue placed in each container is
weighed at the beginning and again at the end of the
experiment, the percentage gain or loss of water can
be calculated.

To Investigate the Turgor Movements
Produced by the Sensitive Plant
Mimosa Pudica

Seeds of the sensitive plant may be obtained from
the George W. Park Seed Co., Greenwood, South
Carolina or from the biological supply houses. The
compound leaves with their many fine leaflets close
up rapidly in response to the stimulus of contact. The
time taken for the stimulus to travel from the tip to
the base of the leaf may be measured in seconds.
Recovery requires about 15 minutes.

Observe a sensitive plant that has been left in the
dark. The folding up of the leaves occurs in the dark
as a “sleep” movement.

The Necessity of Nitrogen for Growth

All living things, including the lowest and highest
forms of plant and animal life, require nitrogen for
the synthesis of their proteins. Some can use this
element in a “simple” form such as inorganic nitrate
salts, but others require it in a more complex form
such as an amino acid. The more complex nitrogen
sources are built up by some organisms from simpler
sources. For example, a green plant will synthesize
amino acids and proteins from inorganic nitrogen
but animals will have to eat the plants to obtain their
nitrogen in a form which they can use.

Laboratory Work

The following experiment is designed to illustrate
the necessity of nitrogen for plant growth using
green plants as the experimental subject and an
inorganic salt as the nitrogen source.

1. Substrate — washed sand in 4” clay pots.

2. Stock nutrient solutions:

47

a) KH2 P04 13.5 gm/100 ml H20
b) MgSO4°7H20 45.3 gm/100 ml H20
c) Ca(N03)204H20 23.6 gm/100 ml H20
d) CaCl2 11.1gm/100 ml H20
e) FeC13 0.5 gm/100 ml H20
f) tartaric acid 0.5 gm/100 ml H20
3. Nutrient solutions for 1 liter.

+ N —N
KH2 P04 2.0 2.0
MgSO4 2.0 2.0
Ca(N03)2 3.0 —
CaCl2 — 3.0
Fe soln. 1 drop 1 drop

4. Rooted cuttings are best. Plants started from
seed have a large supply of nitrogen in the seed.
Coleus plants are easily rooted in moist sand or
vermiculite. Others may also be used.

5. The rooted cuttings are placed in the pots of
sand and soaked thoroughly with nutrient every 2-3
days. The plants must of course, be in light or receive
supplementary illumination with fluorescent tubes.

6. The plants may be examined for height,
number, size and color of leaves, and for other
growth effects (succulence, pigmentation, etc.)

Effect of Light on Seed Germination

Some seeds require light for germination; some
are inhibited by light, and others are not affected.
Temperature also plays an important role in
germination.

1. Light requiring: Lettuce seeds, var. Grand

Rapids and Early Curled Simpson.

2. Light inhibited: Phacelia tanacetifolia.

3. Indifferent: Mustard or grass seed.

Petri dishes containing 1 circle of filter paper plus
5 ml. of water, plus 50 seeds, are easily handled.
These are darkened by wrapping in aluminum foil.

Laboratory Work

Immediately following the placing of the seed in
the dish, either wrap or expose for one hour to light
(white or light filtered through colored cellophane)
and then wrap in foil. Examine for percentage
germination after three days. Run at room
temperature and at higher temperatures. Additional
projects could determine the effects of gibberellic
and on germination by incorporating 0.001%
gibberellic acid in the water in the petri dish.

Movement of Plants

Although most plants do not “walk or slither” they
do move. Some of these movements involve
differential increases in the size of cells on one side of
a stem while others involve changes in cell numbers.
Certain plant movements, called tropisms, are

 




 

 

controlled by physical factors operating through cell
mechanisms. One of these physical factors—light—
can be easily studied in a classroom.

A. Phototropism to White Light

It is common experience that plants on window
sills bend towards the light. Coleus plants do this
very readily. Some other plants, like English Ivy (the
ivy that grows on buildings), orient their leaves
differently. This can be easily studied by placing the
plants on the classroom window. Since the
mechanism of phototropic bending involves internal
readjustments of plant hormones, the experiments
can be extended by spraying the plants with 1)
indoleacetic acid (0.01%) and 2) with triiodobenzoic
acid (0.01%).

B. Phototropism with Colored Light

The phototropic response is dependent upon the
wavelength (color) of light.

Bean or corn seeds, planted in moist sand, will
form seedlings in 5-7 days. Pots of these plants,
grown in light, can be placed in cardboard boxes with
a single slit in the side of the box to admit the light
from a 100 watt bulb about a foot from the box. The
slit can be covered with blue, green or red
cellophane (3 layers of each). After 24-48 hours in
the box the amount of bending can be measured. As
an additional project, identical plants can be sprayed
with indoleacetic acid or triiodobenzoic acid.

Gibberellin Assay

The following project, showing the dramatic
growth responses in plant materials treated with
gibberellin, was prepared by Chas. Pfizer & Co.,
Manufacturing Chemists, Brooklyn, NY.

Test Plants

Laxton’s Dwarf Progress Peas (Woodruff Seeds).
If not available, probably any dwarf pea will do.
(Other varieties are now used in England).

Seeds should be planted at a uniform depth
(usually 1/4 to 1/2 inch below surface) in crocks filled
with washed sand. Enough seeds (usually 7) should

48

be planted to give 5 selected seedlings. Seedlings
should be ready for use in 7-10 days, at which time
they are from 11/2 to 21/2 inches in height. Select 5
most uniform plants for assay work and uproot
(discard excess plants). Replant crocks with 5
selected seedlings.

Measure height of seedlings from sand level to tip
of tendril. Record this as initial height.

Test Solutions

Standard: A gibberellin solution is made up at 0.5
and 1.0 ppm (mcg/ml) in distilled water: 5 mg of
gibberellin is dissolved in 4-5 drops of ethanol and
diluted to 100 ml with water; this stock solution is 50
ppm concentration. One ml of this solution per 49 ml
of water results in a 1 ppm test solution.

Assay Solution: Material to be assayed (solution
or solid) is diluted in water to give estimated value of
1 ppm gibberellin concentration, test solution should
also be diluted to 0.1 and 10.0 ppm gibberellin
concentration.

If gibberellin estimation cannot be made on
material to be assayed, it should be tested at full
strength and also diluted in serial 1:10 dilutions. This
will cover a wide range of concentrations, enabling
the general level of activity to be determined. Based
on this, a second assay can be made at refined levels.

Water Control

Distilled water is used (with no active ingredient).

Test Method

Five ml of each solution is placed in an atomizer (a
De Vilbis with glass reservoir). Each of the 5 plants in
a crock is sprayed with one squeeze of the bulb, in
sequence, until all of the liquid is exhausted. This
gives approximately 1 ml of solution per seedling
(i.e. 1 mcg of gibberellin/plant). Duplicate crocks
should be run for each test level and for water
control solution;

Measurement of seedling height should be
recorded after 3, 5 and 7 days. By subtraction of
initial height measurements, the amount of growth
can be determined for standard solution and
compared to assay solution and water control.

Glycolysis

The breakdown of sugar, called “glycolysis”, is one
of the main biochemical processes by which energy
is supplied in living organisms. It occurs in both plant
and animal cells.

Glycolysis is accomplished by biological catalysts
called “enzymes.” These are sensitive substances
which are easily destroyed and which require special
conditions to function.

Glycolysis can be carried out in the presence or
absence of oxygen — “aerobic glycolysis” and
“anaerobic glycolysis”, respectively. Normally, aero-
bic glycolysis results predominantly in a process
sometimes called “respiration” and sometimes
“oxidation”, the final products of which are carbon
dioxide and water. Anaerobic glycolysis results in a
process sometimes called “fermentation,” the final
product of which in animals is lactic acid and in
plants, usually alcohol (ethanol) and carbon dioxide.

The products of glycolysis are simple molecules,
smaller than the original sugar molecule, and some

LAB ORA TOR Y WORK

Anaerobic glycolysis can be demonstrated very
nicely, using the single celled plant, yeast. In this
organism, the last step of sugar breakdown
(anaerobically) differs from that in animal cells and
results in the production of carbon dioxide and
alcohol instead of lactic acid. It can be shown that
when yeast cells are added to a sugar solution, the
sugar is used up and carbon dioxide is produced.
The necessary equipment is sketched in the
accompanying diagram. It consists of:

1. A funnel (about 500 ml capacity) supported by
an open ring.

2. A graduated cylinder (no lip) about 500 ml
capacity, fitted with a two—hole cork or rubber
stopper through which are inserted a short length of
glass tubing connected by rubber tubing to the
funnel, and a longer length reaching almost to the

 




 

top of the cylinder and connected by rubber tubing
to the bottle described below.

3. A bottle or flask (about 500 ml capacity) fitted
with a one—hole cork or rubber stopper through
which is inserted a short length of glass tubing
connected to the rubber tubing from the cylinder.

4. A water bath and source of heat (preferably a
Bunsen burner).

5. Yeast. A packet of “active dry yeast” should be
used for each test. It is obtainable in grocery stores.

6. Sucrose or glucose.

Add water through the funnel until the inverted
cylinder is filled almost to the top of the longer glass
tube.

Add 200 ml of a 1 percent sugar solution to the
bottle and place it in the water bath at 30-320C until
it comes to temperature.

Add the yeast and suspend it evenly by shaking.
Connect the bottle to the cylinder and start taking
periodic readings of the water level in the cylinder
until no more gas is produced.

Notes

There is considerable evidence to show that
given similar amounts of oxygen, cancer cells will
utilize less of it than normal cells and produce a
higher proportion of the products of fermentation.

Graduated cylinders usually have lips which may
be flattened by heating in a flame and pressing in.
Ungraduated cylinders are obtainable without a lip.
Graduation can be marked off by adding measured
volumes of water.

The funnel should be at such a position that its
lower portion is near the level of the top of the tube
in the cylinder. Enough space should be left in the
funnel to accommodate all the water in the cylinder.

Before taking the reading, shake the bottle
containing the yeast to break the bubbles and release
the gas. Read the level with the funnel lowered so
that its water level is the same as that in the cylinder.

Some aerobic glycolysis may occur due to the
oxygen in the bottle, but the amount of carbon
dioxide to be expected from this amount of oxygen
can be calculated to be only about one-tenth of the
tOtal to be expected from anaerobic glycolysis of 3
grams of glucose or sucrose.

Suggested Additional Tests

1. Using linear graph paper, plot the time (in
minutes) on the horizontal axis against the volume of
gas produced (in ml) on the vertical axis. Repeat the
experiment using a temperature a few degrees lower

50

than 30°C and note how the slope of the curve is
affected. Try a higher temperature.

2. Test the starting sugar solution with Fehling’s
solution. If sucrose is used, this should first be
hydrolyzed by addition of a few drops of
conCentrated hydrochloric acid and boiling for a few
minutes. (Before testing, neutralize the acid). Test the
filtered, clear solution at the end of the experiment
and compare the result. What would happen if more
sugar were added?

3. At the end of the experiment, keep the cylinder
inverted and shake until most of the gas dissolves.
To a portion of the solution, add a clear solution of
barium hydroxide. What is the precipitate? What
dissolved substance was responsible for the reaction?

Discussion

The experiment not only demonstrates the
biochemical process of glycolysis but also illustrates
some physical and chemical principles. These will be
understood from a consideration of the following
questions:

1. When the long tube in the cylinder is not
attached to the bottle but left open to the air, where
will the level in the cylinder be with respect to the
level in the funnel (or connecting tube)? Why are the
levels the same? How is this applied in making a
Qphon?

2. What is the effect on the volume of gas
measured of raising or lowering the funnel? What
does this tell you about the properties of gases?
(Compressibility, relation of volume to pressure).

3. The maximum volume of carbon dioxide to be
expected when 2 g of sugar are utilized anaerobically
is roughly 500 ml. Assuming that this volume was
produced why would a smaller volume be observed
in the particular set-up? (See additional Test 3).
What could be used instead of water to make the
volumetric determination of CO produced more
accurate? Devise a method for weighing it instead of
measuring the volume (see additional Test 3).

4. If additional Test 1 has been done, something
will be'known about the effect of temperature on rate
of glycolysis. Does the rate increase indefinitely with
temperature? Does glycolysis cease to occur at
higher temperatures? If so, will it go again when the
temperature is lowered? What does this tell you
about the properties of enzymes?

5. What is “active dried yeast?” Would yeast dried
in an oven at high temperature cause glycolysis?
How might yeast be dried without destroying the
enzymes?

THE NATURE COUNSELOR .
OR

THE WOMAN IN CAMP WHO ,HAs THE MOST FUN (OR count»)

Being a nature counselor in a camp means counseling the young people in
the ways of nature. Sounds extremely simple. But it doesn't always work out that
way. But why shouldn't it? It does seem possible to have the nature in camp one
of the most interesting, thrilling, and lasting experiences of a Camper's days. How
can we bring this about? Wish We knew. But, at least, we can point up some things
to do (and not to do.) that will help every camp to find a nature counselor, equip
that counselor with the tools she needs, and give her the proper opportunities to
. carry on her work for the good of the camp - both the humans and the site.

 

Do we need a nature counselor in our camp?

 

When we go to a strange.placc we learn very little about it unless we have
learned about it before going, or have a friend who acts as our guide, or employ a
guide. Therefore it seems logical that a camp needs someone who knows the out—of-
doors and who knows how to pass that knowledge on to those who do not knOW'-— both
young and old.

True, it is the job of everyone in camp to do a little about interpreting
nature because that is the setting of any camp. But what is everyone's job is no-
one's job, and‘we all knOW'tr at it is practically impossible to get counselors who
all have enough nature background to make nature interesting to the beginner. There-
fore, it is just plain imprsctzcal to think that we can find many counselors who
Ahave the knowledge to carry the campers beyond the knowledge of the beginners. And
for young people who camp year after year, there should be progressive experiences
and knowledge for them, in nature aS'wel]. as in swimming, outdoor cooking, or anyb-
thing else.

Where can we find a nature counselor?

 

we might just as well make up our minds, Egg, that good ones are as scarce
as hen's teeth. But keep on looking!

In any community there are people who have nature as a hobby. These people
may be in the school system, in business firms, in professional life, at home as
mothers of children and homemakers. There are also people who teach nature study or
general science in the Schools. And there are other camps that have more than one ~-
or are "bringing up" a new counselor, and would spare you one' The only way to learn
about this is to keep in touch. with your.friends in camping. Many times a camp would
like to have its nature counselor Spend a summer or part of a summer in another camp.
It is a broadening experience for the counselor and she is bound to bring a few new
g'ways of doing things back to her own camp. '

Among the Program Aides, or other older girls in camp, there must be one,
now and then, who shows an aptitude for nature and who would work in that subject
during the summer. And it might be possible for the camp people to find ways for
that perSOn or persons to get additional nature training in the winter.

'What should we 100k for in a nature counselor?

 

 

First, a nature counselor should be an outgoing person -— a person who is.

 




- 2.-

interested in people as well as in nature ~~ who is patient with the beginner -- who.
is not inclined to show off her own knowledge but who will use her greater knowledge
in ways that will encourage the beginner.

A nature counselor should be a person with a minor hobby in another field
because it helps her to establish herself in more than one way. She might be a good
swimmer, or outdoor cook, or wood carver, or song leader, anything. Of course, the
more talents she has, the better. A nature counselor should be a person who is able
to convert her formal biological training into enjoyable nature study; who can work
with a small amount of equipment; who does not feel it necessary to dissect frogs and
snakes in camp. The latter has very little place -— in fact, no place -- in the
kind of nature study that should be done in a camp setting. ..

' A nature counselor should not be a "prime donna" in her attitude toward her
work. She probably has more opportunities to carry on her work in camp than any
other counselor if she will watch for them. Times are Est aside for eating, swimming,
sleeping, campfire,-but if time is set aside for nature during the camp day, we hope
it doesn't end there: Nature is~5ver'present -- 2h hours of the day: Some of the
most interesting things are "come upon" at odd hours. For instance, the parent
birds do not plan to take their young ones from the nest during the "nature hours" -—
nor do the ants move to new houses, or the toad shed its skin, or the parent fish
parade its young~ones around the shore by the swimming dock. TheSe things are seen
only when all pairs of eyes are peeled at all times: And we will certainly agree
that these~are the kinds of things that human beings like to see and that give them
a feeling for nature.

What is the job 9213 Nature sounselor? ' f
{See "Good Counselors Make Good Camps," pages 6-7, lO-lle Free from

 

Personnel Division, Girl Scouts).

The most successful nature counselors have been given the opportunity to
'work'with the staff as well as with the campers, and it has been understood that the
nature counselor shall have the time and opportunity to explore the camp area to
locate interesting things that will make focal points for hikes. A swimming~counse-
lor likes to go swimming just for her own pleasure, now and then. So, it follows
that a nature counselor likes to go poking around by herself, off and on.

If a really good job has been done in nature in a camp, it is one of the
most difficult things to put on paper in the form of a report that is statistical.
in any'way. And it would sound a little silly -— something like this:-

"we turned over 11h stones and 89 dead logs and found beneath: 2 salaman-
ders, h,02l ants, 2,256 sow bugs, 1 snake, 996% spiders and 3,662 miscellaneous in-
'sects. 'We had 29 bird walks on which we saw h9 species. we learned to identify 38
different kinds of trees" and so on - ad nauseumi

Such a report sounds good in figures but who's to knOW'hOW'muCh the young
ones like or detested the bird walks! .And how many of the "species" they actually
saw.

The success of a nature counselor can only be measured by the increased
observation of and enthusiasm for nature expressed by the entire camp, young and old.
The job of the nature counselor is to accomplish this, to the best of her abilities,
through the devices and methods that best fit her capabilities, knowledge, person—
ality and opportunities. ‘we cannot ask more than this! And to accomplish it through
the best possible conservation practices. -

 




NATURE 1N CAMP I

”Whoever heard of a camp site
that didn’t have nature in it, over
it, under it, and all around it? All
camp sites won‘t have the same kind
of nature, or the same amount but
there will be nature. You can bet
your last nickel on thgt one!

 

¢&E&_ ‘ Perhaps you are saying to your-
' self, "Our girls aren’t interested
in nature!" We'll grant you ONE thing.
They may not all be interested in the same degree. THAT just doesn't happen.
But they will ALL be interested in varying degrees if the adults in the camp
are interested-0r even pretend to be!

 

Let‘s put out of our minds, for the time being, that young people are
not interested in nature because if we don't we are licked before we start.
Let's make a bold attackzand see what we SEE find to do that will interest
all the people in camp—~young and old.

 

Hikes

There can be a great deal more to hiking than just wearing the right
kinds of clothes and packing the right kind of lunch! ‘What are we hiking
£23? 'Why not go to see something? It might be a bird’s nest that someone
has found; or a nice clump of fenns; or an old rotten tree, or
a particularly nice view; or a place where a certain kind of
animal lives. In other words, go somewhere to see something,
and you'll see plenty along the way!

We don't always have to hike with food. Eating is the
end result of too many hikes. Try a few short hikes for
"looking" purposes. Take a few young ones at a time. Show
them.how to walk quiety and to “keep their eyes open. You
won't know the names of all the things they see but you can
always admire it and congratulate them.on finding it. We
are always seeing a person on the street whose hat or suit
or smile we admire but we don’t know the person's name and
it doesn't worry us too much.

Sleeping Out

 

This is always a thrill for a young'one. Again,
there is something more to sleeping on the ground than
packing your kit and making a comfortable bed and cook—
_ing a meal or two. How proud people feel when they
'have learned enough about wind directions, clouds, and
temperatures so that they are prepared for the kind of
weather they get on that sleeping—out night! And can't
we work into the sleeping~out+learning, something about
the animals they might see or hear? A rabbit Sounds
like an elephant in the middle of the night! ‘We rest

and relax sleeping out.of doors only to the extent.that we knOW'and under-
stand and feel at peaCe with the nature that is around us.

 




- 2--

Cooking Out

 

Does this concern only food and fire-building? No. Again
there is nature learning here. But if we conduct a cook-out
with the speed of a cafeteria lunch in thexniddle of a working
day, we are sunk: A peaceful, relaxed meal in the woods is
an experience loved by all. But it takes time and thought for
other things besides the number of plates and cups, pans and
kettles, we are to take. The selection of the lace, the
type and the condition of the tinder and kindling and wood
are nature learnings. People should be given plenty of time
to gather wood and cut sticks. If they are not rushed they
might see a bird's nes t in the bushes, or a salamander under
a rock, or some spiders with their egg sacs, oreisnampering rabbit, or a
dozen other things.

Cm mp Pets

Every young one likes pets but all young ones are
not fortunate enough to have parents who will let them
have a pet or two. And by pets we don‘t mean just cats
and dogs and horses, we include goldfish and guppies and,
perhaps a grasshopper. In camp is one place where we can
satisfy that longing.

Many camps have a dog or two. Some have sheep or
goats. Some camps have some kittens and let them.grow
up in camp. They never want for homes when the camp
closes! Any camp Can have some goldfish in a balanced

aquarium. Any camp can have a few terraria, already set up as temporary
homes for such interesting creatures as toads, salamanders, earthworms,
and such.

One of the great learnings from having pets in camp is for the young
ones to have the responsibility of taking care of-them. Without that,
half the value is lost. Taking good care of pets helps young ones to de—
velop humane attitudes and responsibility. .

There are two excellent books that any camp should own, namely: "The
Book of Wild Pets" by Moore, and ”A Pet Book for Boys and Girls," by Morgan
(see last page for list of books).

 

_ Now, let's consider some specific forms of life and make a few sug-
gestions for things that could be done in connection with them.

Amphibians

 

This classification of animals includes the toads, frogs, and salamanders.
Frogs and toads can be seen in the daytime but they are
most active at dusk or in the early morning. We are
always having early morning bird walks, why not have an
, early evening toad or frog walk! Any moist place will
do~—a swamp, a river bank, or the edge ofa lake. That's
. the time of day you hear them "sing." Every kind of toad
or frog has a different song. ,And it doesn’t take long

 




- 3 i

to learn them. A flashlight is always handy on a trip like this. Don't
bother the toads and frogs, just find them,give them a good look, and listen
to their song. ‘

Birds

\A‘ _ Try a late afternoon.bird walk sometime. They are
1”“; \”D‘ Y} dé' active then and the light is good. There is a sheet in
(“"fh‘eww~~ _ ”Program Helps for Camp Leaders" (cat. No. 23—310, 50

cents) that tells how to take people on a bird walk even
if you know nothing about birds.

Any camp would profit with a few bird houses. The
.campers can make them in the summer, Set them up, and
in the early spring they will be "rented" by the birds.
The campers will probably not be in camp early enough to see all of them
used but be ause birds have nested in them the camp will probably have more
birds around in the summer. ‘

Toward the end of the summer the campers can take down the bird houses,
repair them if necessary, and put them up again ready for the spring.

A good leaflet on building bird heuses is"Bird Study for Schools, Part
IV, Bird- Houses" by Rog: er T. Peterson, 10 cents.

The two bird books most use ful in camp libraries are "Field Book of
Birds" and "Field Book of Western Birds,” both by Roger Tory Peterson.
Write to the National Audubon Society, 1000 Fifth Avenue and ask for a
list of their publications; also information on their Junior membership.
Their publications are a wonderful help for any camp.

Conservation

 

Lavish living has no place in a camp program. The adven~
ture of camping is "making do,” inventing, and not wasting anye
thing. Real camping is learning to take care of one%:self with
a minimum.amount of material things. Real camping entails
leaving the out- of— doors in better condition than you found
it~~if at all possible.

1::
.1in and

(”511— L'UQI I
The very beginnings of conservation in any camp can be i

in the simple area of cutting cooking sticks,1naking foot _~Iw,.l1-
paths that do not become soil erosion problems, keeping

streams and ponds and lakes clean and unpolluted, fire preé r\/W
vention in and out of buildings. A good aid in this latter

is the leaflet, ”Fire Safety" which was prepared by the National Board of
Fire Underwriters in cooperation with the Girl Scouts. These are free in
quantity from the Girl Scouts. Conservation can be in the area of animal
and plant prot ectior~~live and let LiVe.

A good conservation activity in camp is to get well acquainted with
what lives and grows in the camp, and to be sure the young ones have had
a chance to explore their entire camp site. In too many camps the campers
know but l/h or 1/8 of the site. What a'pityz ‘

 




-4-

You will find good suggestiOns for conservationvactivities in the Girl
Scout Handbook under the Conservation Badge; in "Our Land, Conservation _
Activities for Camp Fire Girls" and in the Boy Scout Handbook under Conser~
vation.

There is one conservation activity we could practice in any camp~~
leave the wild plants alone, unless you know the common ones from the rare
ones. Even at that~~go easy! "It is distressing to see campers picking
the wild flowers to use as table decorations. The drain on the country~
side is terrific. If we have to be that fancy, why not use a piece of a
log with a candle in it. And do we have to have a bunch of floWers or
ferns as a centerpiece when we do trail cooking? If you think about it
for a moment you see that it is incongruous and illogical. 'Why move a
few_flowers or ferns a few feet to be used as’a decoration for less than
an hour? Why not walk those few feet and see the things growing? And
leave them there for others to enjoy; '

Another thing we could cease doing is making wildflower gardens in
camps. If all kinds of flowers and ferns could grow in one small space,
nature would have done that long ago: Any garden enthusiast will tell
you that establishing a wild flower garden is one of the hardest things
to do. If people are willing to spend the time to discover the soil,'
water and light needs of each kind of wild flower then such a garden is
practical. Other than that, the activity has little sense. Far better
to visit these plants in their natural haunts.

Garden Flowers

{:3 Perhaps there is a farm near the camp where they
€::§ .J have a flower garden and/or some houSe plants. Why not
\ {/- make one of the hikes a visit to this farm to learn about
xixﬁi::7 garden flowers? Some camps have a small flower garden as
\K:E>A a nature project~~a place where some of the young ones

can work~~and as a source of blooms for the table.

/fj’/7 _
. ' ‘With a little urging-~and a hint here and there--
’*v’“~“\r-\d~ camp committee members, and other friends, will occasion—
' ' ally bring a bouquet or two to the camp. These can be
used for teaching as well as for decorationt

Insects

One of the first things we can teach a camper is the place of
the mosquito in the scheme of nature. Troublesome though they may
be to us, mosquitoes are food for many things including toads,
frogs, bats, swallows, and all the birds known as fly catchers.

We have a whale of a job to do in making campers feel at
home with and kindly disposed toward insects as a whole and
caterpillars in particular. And with spiders, too, though
they are not insects, but very closely related.

"The first instinct of most campers is to kill every insect in sight.
Teach them, by word of mouth and by example, to look at insects, watch
what they are doing. And help them.to understand that almost every baby

 




- 5 _

bird has to be brought up on a diet of insects, and that many adult birds
eat nothing but insects. Also, teach them that the majority of plants are
insect pollinated. if we destroy'gll insects, indiscriminately, We destroy
birds and plants along with them. -

The above paragraphs should help us all to understand that we cannot.
go around using DDT without thought. And that we certainly cannot drain
swamps without careful thought. I ‘

Unless we are wrong, the point of Camping is to help people to live
out~of-doors. Therefore, they must learn to live with the out~of~doors.

See the "Leader '3 Nature Guide" for program suggestions to be done
with insects.

W

We do not recommend caging any wild mammal unless
you are sure of your state laws and have a very good
'nature counsellor who knows how to handle wild mammals.

_ The number of different kinds of mammals will not
exceed 20 in most camps.' It should not be too difficult
to find pictures of these and see that they are dis-

' p]-ayed in a place where all can see.

' , There are plenty of books that describe the homes
of wild mammals, and to be able to locate the home by'w atching the mammal
is the thrill of a life time! The tracks of some can be found in many
books including the Girl Scout Handbook. In addition, we would suggest
that camp libraries invest in "Tracks and Trailcraft” by Ellsworth Jaeger.
This is the only book that shows the spoor or droppings of mammals which
are just as important to the tracker as the foot prints.

By all means, every camp should get in touch with the Defenders of
Furbearers, 1214 Sixteenth Street, WashingtOn 6, D.C. They have material
and a Junior Membership that should interest all campers—~young and old.
Our mammals need protection from steel traps and from the inroads of the
fur industry and human ignorance.

Reptiles

‘Under this heading belong the Snakes; turtles,
lizards, alligators and crocodiles. What have you
in the camp? Lizards, alligators, and crocodiles
are limited in their range~—only the fortunate few _
camps have themi Snakes and turtles are pretty “H“:fEEEEEEEEfr
general Here, again, we haveEijob to do—-an im+ ' S-rrrwvw
portant job. We have to teaCh campers to respect
a snake. We have to teach them that snakes—-all
snakes~~are useful in the scheme‘of nature. We
have to destroy the poisonous snakes where we have
young ones Camping. .But even while we destroy,~
we can respect. No non—poisonous snake should
ever be destroyed.

 




- 6 -

Cages for snakes are easily made in camp. Unless the caged snake is
eating well and seems to be content, do not keep it caged for more than
2h hours. That will be long enough for everyone to have a look.

You will find good ideas: on snake cages (and a thousand other things!)
in "Nature Hobbies" by Ted Pettit. You will find excellent and easily
digested information on snakes in "Snakes" by Herbert S. Zim. We highly
recommend these for any and eVery camp library.

Rocks and Minerals

 

In and/or around any camp there are rocks and
,5?) minerals. They may be nothing but "pebbles" to you
/¢ but they are either rocks or minerals. Small stones
J <§§§> and pebbles can be collected and studied. Egg boxes
: make good receptacles for the individual collections.
To start, collect stones that look different, wash

. them, and crack them.open with a strong hammer.
Stick a quarter inch square of adhesive tape on each
u -. one and give each one a number. Any camp can find

some one in the community WhO'Will come to the camp
and help the girls identify the specimens in their
. collections. That same person may be able to tell
the campers something interesting about the geological history of the area
in which the camp exists. ”We suggest the Fieldbook of Rocks and Minerals,
by F. D. Loomes as a good book on this subject.

Stars

There is no better chance to learn the stars and con—
stellations than in a camp: “We all know about star gazing
parties and sleeping out so that we can be awakened at
intervals to see the changing position of the constella-
tions. To prepare for this, there is nothing like having
a few sheets of conStruction paper and some gummed stars
and making a few constellations to hang on the wall where
all can see. It helps to get the shape of the constellation well formed in
one's mind. There are different ways of presenting stars indoors as a starter.
You will find such suggestions in the "Leader's Nature Guide" and in "Outdoor
Activities for In~Town Groups." One of the best star books we knOW'iS "A
Dipper Full of Stars," by Lou Williams. Legends in this book, too.

Trees

Not only can we learn to identify trees in camp
(even if we only have two trees!), but'we can learn the
value of trees in soil, water, and wildlife conservation.
You can get good printed information from the Forest
Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture,'Washington, D.C.
we can also learn how to help trees to grow by thinning
out, and we can learn how to plant trees and take care
of them. 'We can learn how to cut dead branches from
trees. Your local forester will give you a great deal
of help in all the above.

'Weather

'Why not set up a weather bureau in camp? Have it in
a central location where all may see. The “Weather Hand-
book" tells just how to set one up and what is needed.
'We can guarantee it will be of interest to the entire camp.
Think what this would mean to hikes and overnights. In
other words, if you get rained on, itksyour own fault!

things called "bushes."

Pressing wildflowers in camp is not usually too successful so try to
do other types of things with them, such as drawing and painting; making a
chart on which to post the names of the variOus kinds as they are found.

Above everything else, try to teach the campers to look at the wild—
flowers where they are and not to pick them. Humans are too prone to yank
up any plant, hold it in mid~air and say, "what is this?"

There are other things a camp needs to carry out a nature program and
.‘we_list them here:—

 

.People

we need to have Camp Committees, Camp Directors, and
Counsellors who are-aware of the need for nature inter-
pretation if we are going to give young ones the fullest
possible camping experience. The Camp Director has to
see that all camp staff are nature-minded and she has to
put concrete experiences into pre~camp training. A camp
needs a nature counsellor. It is just as important in
the camping picture as a waterfront, music, or any other
kind of a Special counsellor. .They are hard to get, we
all agree, but why aren‘t we raising some out of our own campers? 'We have
been in this camping business for a good many years!

where the campers can keep their finds and treasures.

Some place where terraria, aquaria, and small cages

can be made and kept. Some place Where interesting []J:;rﬁ75
pictures can be displayed, where boOks can be kept. - "3%?
This can be a small building or it can be a spare

tent or a small part of some other building. Read

In camp you need things like sciss cors, construc~

 

 

 

“»_» tion paper, pencils, rulers, pictures, cages, aquaria
§§55\ <1‘\::k and terraria. You also need some large strainers (any)

dime or hardware store) to which you can lash long
wooden handles. These are used to dip things out of
ponds and streams for closer scrutiny.

K/%§. ié;a3n In the Leader's Nature Guide you will find
' 1 directions for making insect nets, and in.sect cages.

These things mean coat-hangers, cotton cloth, wire
screening.

 

Get some cigar boxes for keeping rocks and mineral collections, and a
roll of adhesive tape for marking the specimens.

 
    
  
   
 
 

 
  

Get a couple of good saws for tree trimming. Also, some inexpensive
paint—~brown or green-for painting the scars after the tree has been trimmed.

See if you cannot get hold of a pair or two of inexpensive bird glasses.
They do enhance a bird'walkl

 

    
     
  
   
   
   
   
     
     

Keep a couple of tin pails around, for carrying water.

  

Have a small hatchet and chopping block for cutting wood Specimens.

 

Keep a few bottles of assorted pastes and glues on hand.

Have some maps of the area. These may be had from the United States
Geodectic Service. 'Write a post-card to the Superintendent of Documents,
washington, D. C.,4and ask about them.

For a good nature progran certain carpenter tools are necessary, See

the Girl Scout Handbook for a good list of tools any household would find
handy o

 

Have a few inexpensive magnifying glasses on hand, “with which to see
the small wonders of the world.

 

Crayons, water colors, sketching paper and soft pencils are always in
demand. Also~~thumb tacks! Don't forget the show card paint and some
toothbrushes for making Spatter prints.

The above are a few suggestions. When planning the kind of nature
program.you are going to have, be sure to get the equipment you need.
There is nothing more discouraging to counsellor and camper than to get
worked up to making a bird house and find there is neither saw nor hammer
in the camp: It's like getting the flour and baking powder all measured
and sifted for a loaf of ginger bread and then finding you have neither
melasses nor ginger in the house~~and no near neighbors!

we hope that the few things we have written in these pages will help
every camp to have a better and happier nature program. And don't think
the campers won't thank you for it, in the years to come.
Books

Don't skip this section. Books are things you must
have. It is pleasant to find something you have never

seen before, but twice as pleasant to be able to find 1 , p
out what it is and something about it. “Jﬂéiﬂthdmﬂllg
h, . .

In addition to the books we are listing, we would H ‘X

 

suggest that you add one good book on the following sub-

jects and be sure the book is geared for your locality:

trees, ferns, wildflowers, fungi, insects. If you do not

know any such books, get in touch with your local librarian,

or a naturalist in your community, or your State Department of Education,
or your State College, or the Program.Department, Girl Scouts of the U. S. A.

Don't think, for a minute, we are listing all the books on nature.
They are thousands of them: 'we are listing a few that we think will help.
You.may not.find your favorite nature book in this list. And all ours are
not there, either! But we have to begin and to end somewhere.

The books, here, are listed alphabetically, not in the order of their
importance or usefullness.

-13..

This complete list of books would cost approximately $50.00, and that
is not much for a well equipped camp nature librarya Certainly it is a.
very small outlay to help open the dOOTS'Of nature to your campers.

As we said above, you can borrow these books from a_library, local or
state. You can also find people who are willing to donate a book or two.
The local leaders group might be willing to take this on as a project and
get a few books each year and have the books brought back to the local office
for the use of leaders during the rest of the year.

we hope these pages will help you to do a better job of nature learning
in the camp.

The Camp Nature House

Many camps have nature houses and many camps feel the need of one. Of
course, such a center is not necessary for a good nature program, nor does
such a center insure a good nature program. Really, the only thing that can
guarantee a good nature program in camp is an awareness on the part of every
adult present.

The main goal in nature is to teach a respect for and humane.treatment
of all living things, whether we like them or not. To arrive at this goal
means constant interpretation of how living things live. If you feel this can
be done better by having a nature house, then have one. At least it keeps the
caterpillar houses out from under the beds! It does make a place where "treas-
ures" can be kept, cared for, and Worked on. It is a good place to teach the
humane treatment of living things.

waever, we would like to point out a few things that should be kept in
mind if a nature house is going to be a force in teaching nature.

1. Any living thing kept in it must be cared for in the proper way. Nothing
should be kept confined for more than a couple of hours, unless a proper
habitat and food have been provided. If any animal refuses to eat, it should
be taken back where it was found or released into a similar habitat. Kindness
cannot be fostered through cruelty. If we aren't helping young people_to under-
‘stand the 6th Girl Scout law, we'd better close shop.

2. Don't let the nature house become an adult dominated museum. It should be
a place where the girls put up the exhibits, make the signs, do the hostessing,
'when necessary.' It is a place for them to work making their exhibits or caring
for these animals, plants, and minerals. It is a place where they should be
getting that everlasting training in working together.

3. Don'tlunmaexpensive equipment. Let the girls use their own.imagination.

h. Don't try to make a wild flower or fern planting around the nature house.
The transplanting of these things is a simple mattern-all that is needed is a
trowel and a hole and some water. But to make things from several habitats grow
in one habitat is something that Mother Nature, herself, can't do! If it is
necessary to plant at all, plant only things you know will grow there.

 




-11; ..
5. Don't confine nature learning to the nature house.

6. Have the nature-house easily accessible. If you put it at the other end
of nowhere, only those already interested will take the trouble to go there.

 

One Last'Wordl

There must be some fun, lightness, and fellowship in the teaching of
nature or it become as dry as a bug on a pin.

Never let a lack of knowledge keep you from Opening the door of nature
to someone else. 'We all had to begin somewhere, and most of us can remember
laboring over C—A-T and D-O-G and not being too sure which was which!

If you lack knowledge in nature never be ashamed of it. Anyone who
'would laugh at you is not worth his salt!

 

Keep your eyes open to find ways to put nature knowledge to work for the
community. It can be and is done-«but it takes imagination. You have that,
haven't you? . v -

Never lose patience when helping other peeple to learn. Learning floWs
more easily through the channels of kindness and encouragement.

Do every bit of nature you can out-of-doors rather than indoors.

As far as you can, keep nature a study of "living things as they live"
rather than a study of dead things. ;..

Be as enthusiastic about another person's first robin as though it were
not your 2,h99th of the season!

Learn along with your group, even if you can't keep one step, or a half-
step, ahead. .

Go out, keep your eyes open, your ears-cocked, your nose sniffing, hands
free, mouth shut, and feet dry! Good luck!

' "Handle with Gare!

HUGE SPACESHIP has just swoOped
down on your back lawn, and the
rough paw of a giant Martian has

snatched you up—little you! -—to take
home as a souvenir. As you quit this
homey planet, you gasp for air, while
your heart beats in panic and despera-
tion. All that you love has been left he—
hind! Life itself will ebb out soon!
Campers, that image is not too fic-
tional. It’s perhaps what a little chip-
munk feels—or a baby bird, or a butterﬂy,
turtle, frog, or garter snake—suddenly
removed from his happy home in Nature,
whisked into a box and carted off to be
fondled and smothered and starved to
death in some city environment that
never was made for the likes of him!
Nature ,welcomes us into her quiet
places, and always has plenty of room
for us campers who like to live at close
quarters with her.‘ And the longer we live
close to her, the more we learn to see
and to appreciate her plants and animals
and rocks, her varied community of liv-
ing things. For they are a. community.
As you may have suspected, the things of
nature are dependent upon each other.
Some campers collect a few rocks and
minerals to take home. Others, like the
tourist returning from abroad with a
trunkload of useless baubles, show a
great desire to gather various kinds of
plants and animals to take home. The
tendency to remove these things from the
out—of—doOrs is a worry to all nature-
minded people. First, because the inhabi-
tants of natureland should be preserved
where others can enjoy them. Second,
because other members of the family
may not relish having these creatures in
the house. Third, because few people
know the proper care of the various in—
sects, salamanders, turtles, snakes, and

sun himself on a rock;

wild mice that may be part of the “invasion.”
Often they are disposed of in a manner not at all
humane. Sometimes they merely gasp their last in
neglect and panic—as you on the spaceship—far
from their home in the woods and their work in
the world.

The real conservationist gets great pleasure out
of merely watching the things of the wild, while
in camp-and leaving them there, to preserve the
“balance of nature.”

Of course it is always possible to have some
animal in captivity in camp for a few hours or
days. The length of time depends on the kind of
animal and how much is known about its care.
For instance, a moth can beat its wings to pieces
in a few hours. A nursing mammal (such as a
mouse or rabbit) should never be confined, be-
cause it has young somewhere, and they need
their mother’s care. An injured animal sometimes
needs to be kept in captivity for a short time, but
only if someone is going to give it the careful,
steady care it needs in order to recover.

Small birds and animals should never be taken
from their mothers unless it is absolutely necessary.
For a wild baby to be “abandoned” by its mother
is a thing almost unknown in nature. Two things
can happen that may make it look so—the mother
(or both parents) may have been killed, perhaps
by another animal or a car. Or, the mother may
have distributed her young in different spots for
their safety, as often happens with birds just out
of the nest. We see one of these fluffy things

 




precariously perched on a twig, hollering its
head off! But the parents know where it is
and, if we sit quietly and watch, we will see
it fed. That is a much more interesting sight
than a baby bird in a cage, and a human
being standing around, not knowing what
to do!

It takes little skill to capture an animal.
It takes a great deal of skill and patience to
walk or stand or sit quietly and watch what
the animal does. And there is enormous satis—
faction in feeling that much a part of the
out—of—doors. A great deal is known about
the looks of animals, but not so much about
the ways of animals. And their ways are bet—
ter studied when they are watched in their
natural setting.

As for wild plants—let’s leave them alone,
too. Very few of them can live for long in
the house. And as for picking ﬂowers—why
do it in camp? Clumps of wildflowers bloom-

ing in the woods and fields provide a lovelier
sight than a bunch of them on a dining-room
table. Just think—millions of people go camp-
ing in summer. If each of them picked the
ﬂowers, there would soon be none left for
others to see. Some flowers are common and
bloom quickly—but others, such as the lady’s-
slipper (moccasin ﬂower) do not. It takes
at least seven years from the time a seed
germinates before the plant has its ﬁrst bloom.

We campers do not take lightly the Sixth
Girl. Scout Law, “A Girl Scout is a friend to
animals.” Therefore, we do not kill or injure,
needlessly or carelessly, any living thing.
These words we carry with us 'into the out-
of—doors, and the smallest and most insignifi-
cant looking thing of nature becomes safe
in our hands. THE END

National Association of Biology Teachers

CONSERVATION PROJECT

T 0 help increase the effecti renew of eomerm time and

remu rte-me teaching by biology teacher;

The three-year conservation project has been developed by the National Association of Biology Teachers, with the help
of a grant-in-aid from the American Nature Association. The project is designed to develop and promote the acceptance
of a set of criteria or objectives, which can be documented by actual illustrations of good teaching techniques particularly
by biology teachers, and which can be used to stimulate many more teachers to increase the emphasis on conservation.

Committees are organized in each state to activate and conduct the project. State committee meetings, and state and
regional work conferences will be organized in cooperation and in conjunction with meetings of other professional groups
to prepare plans, screen and edit materials and to initiate new activities. All biology teachers and others interested in helping
with the project are urged to contact the Project Leader, or the state and regional chairmen, or members of the Executive
Committee, listed on the back of this letter.

References

We recommend the use of four specific new yearbooks and manuals, along with the numerous national texts and ref-
erences on conservation listed in their bibliographies, to state committees and schools desirous of establishing sound def-
initions and programs in conservation education. They are:

Use of Criteria

We recommend the following criteria as guides in:
Locating outstanding conservation teaching by biOIOgy teachers.
Securing examples of techniques and good teaching practices which will illustrate one or more of the criteria.

Preparing descriptions of the examples suggested or of comparable ones, to publish and share with other interested
teachers.

Stimulating greater emphasis on conservation in biology programs.

If you have completed one or more examples which will illustrate any of the criteria, prepare your description as indi-
cated in the following instructions. If you have not as yet completed any conservation activities but would like to do so, we
suggest that you experiment with one or more of the projects or techniques suggested and report your results to the com-
mittee for possible publication. Send such descriptions to your state chairmen or to RICHARD L. WEAVER. Project Leader.

Criteria for Conservation Teaching in Biology
prepared for use in the

Conservation Project of the National Association of Biology Teachers

A. Conservation Education includes and shows the relationships of the natural. human. social and economic resources. The

biology teacher is particularly responsible for instruction in techniques and information related to the wise use of the
natural resources.

care?”

The biology class arranged a panel of representatives of resource agencies to show how each agency was concerned
with the problem of stream pollution in a city.

Data were obtained by the biology classes resulting from soil tests and observations of animals showing results of
mineral deficiencies in the soils of a county.

Biology students compared an area reforested and planted with wildlife cover with one not improved to record the
increase in wildlife and the decrease in soil erosion.

Data were obtained which showed the detrimental effects of too much drainage on wildlife populations and on the
lowering of the water table in certain parts of the state.

The biology students compared the land use practices and the population changes in their county with another dissim-
ilar county in the state to show the value of good conservation farming.

The biology students studied the subdivision of the city in which they lived to see if the space was being used most

efficiently if the various wastes were disposed properly, if blighted areas could be reclaimed and if soils need special
treatment for vegetables and ﬂowers.

B. Conservation Education is an integral part of the curriculum. The biology teacher shares responsibility for a large part
of the conservation emphasis and seeks to integrate biological information with the activities of other subjects and ap-
propriate extra-class activities.

The biology and vocational agriculture classes cooperated in planting a windbreak around the school grounds.

The biology and home economics classes developed a rooting bed for shrubs and flowers to be used in landscaping
the school and the homes of interested students.

Tittle bliology classes assisted the Junior Bird Club in the Fifth Grade in establishing a wildlife sanctuary near the
SC 00 .

The biology club set up a wildlife display in the Science Fair at school and at the county fair.

The biology class cooperated with the history class in developing a local history of the way the natural resources had
been used in the area since its settlement.

C. Conservation Education is fitted to the experiences. needs. and interests of the pupils. Biological interests which are
stimulated by out-of—school activities are used in the school program and the conservation act1v1t1es Within the school are
directed so as to carry over into out-of-school activities.

Conservation education develops proper attitudes toward the wisest use of all resources. Correct conservation attitudes

are incorporated and allied with other character-building and citizenship efforts.

Members of the biology class were instrumental in getting a number of boys to stop shooting song birds with BB guns,
by interesting them in “shooting them” with cameras.

The biology class organized a forestry patrol for planting trees and putting out ‘forest fires in the area.

The biology class worked with the student council in maintaining attractively landscaped schoolgrounds, encouraging
plantings, and protecting trees and shrubs.

The biology students participated with students in social studies in a series of symposia and discussions on private
enterprise vs public interest in resource development.

The biology class provided .the necessary biological information to help the civics class in making a safety map and
plan for the city, which was accepted and used by the student council.

Conservation education rovides u ils with information about careers in conservation and rovides stimulating work
P P

experiences and contacts with professional conservationists.

The biology class regularly visits farms, state parks, forests and fish hatcheries, to study the conservation practices
and to assist locally in tree planting, fish stocking, or running lines for terraces.

The biology classes spent a week at a school camp in a state park, studied and worked with professional conserva-
tionists on conservation projects.

The biology students cooperated in planning and conducting a career day sponsored by the guidance office.
The county forester, soil conservationist, wildlife technician and a local nurseryman were used as consultants in
developing plans for making the schoolgrounds an outdoor teaching laboratory.

Students made a survey of the professional opportunities in teaching conservation, in nature writing and photo-
graphy, and in school or private camp work.




Conservation education is a cooperative enterprise between school and community. bringing about a better understanding
of resource problems and developing plans for the solution of them.

1. Thte biology class assisted the health department in a survey and control of mosquito breeding areas, in and near the
Cl y.

2. The biology class worked with th health classes in a survey of hook worm infestation in the county and helped the
health department in its educational program on elimination of the causes. .

3. The biology class gathered all available information on the best agricultural practices for the' county and dramatized
the EffeCtS 0f one-crop farming and the need for diversification and soil conservation at a series of community gath-
ings.

“he biology students developed a testing service for seed germination and soil acidity for the families served by the
SC 00 .

The biology classes helped the state conservation officials locate abandoned mines which needed sealing to protect
the local streams.

. The biology class assisted town officials in developing an area for a community park, a nature trail, a wildlife sanctu-
ary.
The biology class studied stream pollution and solicited the interest of the community in control measures to make
the stream ﬁt for recreational use.

. The biology class demonstrated on the school property how to utilize leaves from city streets, garden wastes and
garbage from the cafeteria in making mulch.

. The biology students made block surveys in the city to determine the shade tree needs and assisted town officials
in planting suitable varieties.

cochlea?!"

Conservation education is well-balanced with respect to content. It embraces a broad consideration of the biological in-
terrelations which exist among wildlife, water, forests, grasslands, wastelands, 5011, minerals and people.

1. The biology classes developed and used a portion of the school ground or a school or town forest as an area to observe
ecological succession in nature, and to determine the types of management practices needed to conserve certain aspects
of the environment. They developed a nature trail in it for the use of all students and parents.

2. The biology students prepared maps, pictures, and models illustrating good and poor conservation practices in the
county and displayed them for civic groups, clubs and P.T.A.’s.

3. The pupils prepared graphs and charts to show the good and bad effects of local industries in the area.
4. The biology class made a comparison of self-sufficient farming versus commercial or one-crop farming.
5. The biology class developed plans for reclaiming blighted areas nearby.

Conservation is taught as a science and biological research provides the data for development .of conservation plans and
procedures. This scientific information is translated into social action, as good conservation is improved behav10r.

1. Biology students helped identify local conservation problems, determined the causes scientifically and through controll-
ed experiments developed suitable plans for their solution.

2. Soil tests, population counts of plants and animals were made on areas under different management plans to show the
effects of over-grazing, one crop farming, improper forest cutting as contrasted to the best practices.

3. The students grew seedlings in soil or water of different mineral deficiencies and then compared their results with
soil tests of neighborhood soils.

4. The biology class experimented with earthworm cultures and compared their results with population counts of earth-
worms in local soils.

Conservation education begins at home but eventually includes the problems. the developmental plans and prOper atti-
tudes and habits applicable to the county. state region. nation and the world.

1. The students traced the historical, agricultural, and industrial development of the county and state and correlated
those with the reduction or prOper maintenance of the natural resources.

2. The biology class cooperated with the social study classes in providing information as to the contributions of biology
in the Point Four program.

3. The biology students arranged for panels and discussion groups of representatives of different countries to gain a
better understanding of the mutual resource problems.

4. The biology students analyzed the causes of the dust bowl, the effects of the cotton and tobacco economy in the South,
and the values of the national parks.

The best existing textbooks. pamphlets. ﬁlms. recordings and other instructional aids are utilized but an attempt is also
made to develop materials that are adapted to the communities own environment and resources.

1. A series of slides and movies were developed which illustrated the most important local resource problems and show-
ed suggested solutions.

2. Arrangements were made and a list compiled of places to go in the county where different things could be studied and
photographed, and where ﬁeld trips could be conducted.

Conservation applies to all people. rural and urban and to be most effective a common viewpoint with respect to resource
use should be established which shows the interdependence of all groups.

1. The biology classes worked with the agricultural classes and FFA clubs in dramatizing the close relationship of rural
and urban development to better roads, more markets, more employment, better health and better schools.

2. The biology class sponsored a conservation fair which was participated in by all the schools in the city and county show-
ing the results of conservation projects and activities in all the schools.

3. The biology class found suitable plots in the city where experimental work on vegetables, flowers, and shrubs could
be conducted and proper uses demonstrated for various fertilizers, insecticides, and weed killers.

The biology class conducted a metal scrap recovery project to help raise funds for a community center.

5. The biology students made a study of the money spent in cities by rural people and the money invested and spent in
the county by City people, to show the interdependence of rural and urban areas.

6. The biology students interviewed bank officials and farm loan agencies to see how improved land use practices are
encouraged by loans.

7. A wildlife club was organized in the city to assist farmers in the area with wildlife improvements and proper hunt-
ing prac ices.

Instructions to Teachers for Preparing Descriptions of Techniques

. Some teachers and schools will have conducted more than one project or activity. However it will be helpful to the edit-
ing committees if each project, activity or technique is described separately. In these descriptions, the followmg things should

be included.

1. With which group, in which schoolrand during what period of time was it used?
2. How the particular activity, project or technique originated and the part the students, parents, and community

leaders had in planning it?

How the work was organized, the people who assisted in the execution of it, and the way the students and other classes

shared in it?

Which particular resource problem or conservation attitudes were stressed in the development of the work?
How the work was evaluated and what tangible results could be observed or recorded?

Other things which you consider important.

. Pictures and charts or graphs should be included with the description wherever possible.

BEAVER VALLEY is the outstanding‘walt Disney True Life.Adventure
which won.the 1950 Academy Award. BEAVER'VALLEY shows birds, animals and fish
in.their natural habitat-~the region of a beaver pond-~going about their busi-
ness of courtship, house-making, and survival. Their very lives have been
caught by the camera in.a manner nothing short of remarkable. In this story
of a beaver pond and the wild~life that inhabits it, the audience sees the
industrious beaver, busily building his dams and lodges; the clowning of the
otters; the coyote on the prowl; birds, crickets, frogs, Spawning salmon; a
moose foraging; a hungry bear catching salmon. There is humor to be found in
BEAVER‘VALLEY in a frog symphony where the sound track brings to life the
hollownthroated creaking of the frogs; in the playful otters' utilization of
a snow~covered.bank as a togoggan.slide; in.scenes of a merganser teaching

  




-2-

her young to fly. BEAVER‘VATTEY presents these pictures of wild life with a

story—like continuity that builds up interest and suspense in.an.absorbing
narrative with comedy trimmings.

NATURE'S HALF.ACRE, another of the Welt Disney True Life Adventures
won the.Academy.Award in 1951. In.NATURE'S.EAIF ACRE Walt Disney works his
magic once again with live—action and through the wizardry of stopnaction and-
time lapse photography and the magnifying lens giVes the audience a closeup
of the exciting drama of the elemental law of the survival of the fittest and
the struggle for existence to he found in.any garden spot, field or woodland.
The sequences of NATURE'S BATE ACRE are as follows~-In a meadow, songs of many
birds are heard. The natural sounds of the outdoors blend into a "Symphony of
Spring" —- a musical sequence featuring the birds and butterflies. A nest—
building sequence follows. Then.wood4boring insects are seen laying their
eggs beneath the bark of a.tree; a moth glues her eggs to a twig. Caterpillars.
emerge in due course and.begin to eat leaves, but nature's system of balance
is emphasised when the mother birds are shown feeding caterpillars to their
young. The story moves on to summer. Seen are bumblebees pollinating the
flowers, the honeybees at work. The countering fight for survival is drama-
tized.when a bee is caught in a spider's web. The spider in turn is prayed on
by the mud dauber. The sundew plant and the venus flytrap catch insects too.
The ant lion lies in wait for unwary ants. The toad gulps a caterpillar. The
praying mantis captures a fly and even tackles a black widow spider. The
chamelon captures katydids and grasshoppers and butterflies. In the fall the
surviving caterpillars spin themselves into cocoons; others shed their skins
for a Chrysalis; the leaves turn color and the streams freeze. Snow covers
NNTURE'S EAL? .333 and the tide of life is at its lowest ebb. In time, winter's
icy grip is broken; nature stages her most impressive miracle, the re—awakening
of life. Once again the “Symphony of Spring" is heard. Spring returns to
NATURE’S HALF ACRE.

BOY ANI)TBE EAGLE is an interesting study of how a wounded eagle

. and a crippled boy help each other to complete health. The story shows how
Dickie Mbore, as a lad crippled.by infantile paralysis, finds his pleasure in
ascending thc.Malibou.Mountains of Southern California. The boy is advised
by his physician that he could throw away his crutch if he would only try to
walk without it. The boy, held tightly in the clutches of fear, shrinks from
making the effort. One day, while out on one of his tours of adventure, the
lad finds an.eagle that has been.wounded by a hunter. He takes the bird home
and trains it. Both the boy and the eagle become fast friends, one with a
broken win , the other on crutches. Facing the two hardships together, their
friendship is increased so that where one goes so goes the other. ‘The boy, by
chance, loses his crutch on the steep mountainside. He falls into a rattle~'
snake nest. ,He is defenseless, until the eagle, sensing his friend‘s danger,
flies to the rescue and attacks the vicious reptile. The snake is vanquished
in an epic battle and the boy is saved. Imring the encounter the eagle dis~
covers that it can.use its wings and the boy learns that he can walk without
the aid of his crutch. ’

SAVAGE SPLENDOR, a unique story, presents a pictorial record of
the human and wild life of Africa. Enhancing the documentation of the tribes,
customs and animal life of Africa with the natural beauty of Technicolor, SAVAGE
SETENDOR presents the dark continent in.all its reality. Scenes of dangerous
wild'heasts in action are presented in close—up photography, together with cap-
ture of giraffes, ostriches and rhinoceri. Lions are shown.at their kill and
hippopotami are filmed for the first time in underwater scenes. Various African
tribes are portrayed conducting their strange rituals and tribal dances. All
in.all, SAVAGE SPTENDOR is a must for school audiences.

It has occurred to me that your organization
might be interested inthe fact that in the
Girl Scout badge progran (100 different badges)
there is one called the Cat and Dog badge and
another the First Aid to Animals. The badge

"figures for the year ending December 31, 1952
show that 19,107 Cat and Dog badges were sold
and 4,76h First Aid t0 Animals.

We are graleful to organizations, such as yours,
that help us with our program.

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you, so much, for the two little booklets, "You and Your Dogn
and "Kittens and Cats." They are about the cutest and most useful
things I've seen in a long time. If you did the sketches, my
congratulations:

Your kind offer of help with our animal projects isggreatly and
sincerely appreciated. In general, we need the help of all humane
minded people in trying to make the 6th Girl Scout Law, "A Girl Scout
is a Friend to Animals," live for our young peeple. We need their
help in our local units and on the National level.

I wish that someday you might spare a little time that we might get
together and talk over areas where our two organizations could be of
mutual benefit.

'With best wishes ~

Sincerely,

SOME WAYS TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE
Save the Soil

Trees, shrubs, and grass help save the soil. Improper logging, forest ﬁres, poorly drained roads,
careless farming, and .overgrazing of range and pasture lands mean loss of soil. Thoughtful people
manage their farm, range, and forest lands with the least possible damage and loss. They use the
soil well. I

Keep Forests Productive

Wise owners use their forests carefully. When they harvest their forest crop, they leave plenty
of healthy young trees to produce another crop. They protect their forests from insects, disease, and
ﬁre. They control grazing. They keep their forests producing for their own beneﬁt and for the
good of the Nation. '

However, there are still far too many owners who are careless and waste forests that will be badly
needed in the future.

Protect Our Watersheds

A watershed or drainage basin is land that collects rain and melted snow that make a stream.
. When a watershed is in good condition, the trees, brush, grass, and litter on it protect the soil. They
break the force of beating rains, slow down runoff, and keep the soil from washing away. Water
that reaches the ground passes through the plant litter and spongy humus into the soil below, which
is able to take and hold it. This water then seeps through the soil to underground water reservoirs
or channels which feed springs and wells.

Some watersheds are small. Others cover thousands of square miles. Everyone who lives,
works, and plays in our watersheds should help protect them. Campers, farmers, ranchers, lumber-
men help when they use the plant cover properly and control forest enemies. Yet many millions of
watershed acres are damaged yearly by improper logging, overgrazing, and ﬁre. When water falls
on this bared land, it runs off quickly to make ﬂoods, wash away the soil, and do other damage.

By protection and careful use we can keep our watersheds healthy, and they will provide the
water all growing things need.

Help Provide Wildlife With Food, Shelter, and Water

Wildlife is a natural resource. Birds, mammals, and ﬁsh provide enjoyment and income for

millions of people. Well-managed forests and ranges furnish wildlife with food, shelter, and water.
Wise use of these resources balances wildlife populations with the food supply and normal uses of
the land.

Our forests, range forage, and wildlife are renewable resources. They are related one to the other.
They should be managed together, each getting its full share of attention. Our country, our States,
our communities, and each one of us will beneﬁt.

New York 1, New York

Dear Miss Draper:

Your letter of August 21 addressed to Dr. Warren W. Knox has
been referred to me for reply. I wish also to acknowledge the
attached booklet. ’

So far as I know, no study has been made as to what extent
living animals are used in biology or science classes and for what
purposes. I think you might obtain this information by making an
analysis of the textbooks in current use; textbooks are usually a
reasonably accurate index of what is actually taught in high school
classes. A list of the most widely used biology textbooks is given
in a laboratory manual entitled "Experiences in Life Science" by
Edna Craig and George K. Stone, published by The Macmillan Company.

One difficulty in obtaining a clear answer to your question is
the lack of a clear definition of what is and is not an animal. Is
a Blepharisma an animal? How about a mosquito? Dros0phila melano-
gaster is probably the most widely used laboratory animal of all;
is the Institute concerned with its treatment and welfare? Your
booklet gives absolutely no clues to the answers.

I was very much surprised to find the statement on page three
that no units exist for the measurement of pain. The fact is that
there are several useful scales for measuring pain, the most common
being the lO-step "dol scale." On this scale the threshold of pain
is considered as one dol which is equivalent to 220 millicalories
of heat per square centimeter of skin surface per second; the pain
ceiling is 10 dols and the scale is graduated in ten equal steps
between threshold and ceiling. The dol scale has been very useful
in pain studies in both human beings and other animals though there
is evidence that pain in the usual' sense does not exist in many of
the lower animals.

I want you to know that we are interested and concerned with
this problem. We are certain that high schools are doing a good job
in developing attitudes of humaneness to animals and no case of
cruelty or torture has come to our attention.

Sincerely'yours,

1mg WW;

Dear Members of the Audubon-Humane Club;

Welcome back to school. I know you had an exciting
summer filled with many happy days and new adventureso
Perhaps you were lucky in getting away to a camp where
you enjoyed a program of swimming and all kinds of games.
Almost every camp has a nature museum, and it was fun, I
am sure, to learn first hand about the animals and plants
that were close to your camp site. These were the same
animals that you had read and talked about during the club
meetings, and it must have been exciting to see the animals
so closely and to study their peculiar ways of moving and
eating.

We are completely surrounded by all sorts of living
things and even in crowded factory sections of New Haven,
there is an opportunity of seeing some form of animal life.
Birds, because of their rapid method of flying are perhaps
the most common, and you will want to know more about them,

|and what they do for use

Many boys and girls have pets, a parakeet, canary, cat,
, or a tankful of tropical fish, but they are not always
certain in handling and giving their pet proper carea
0 learn a great deal aoout animals and their care
oining the Audubonwﬂumane Slub. The enclosed newsheet
11 Life is a gift to your club from he Animal Welfare
ue of New Haven.

0

This September the material sent to all new members is

entirely different from other years. Each member receives
a club notebook containing interesting stories about marshes,
s

meadows and fore ts with a description of the animals and
plants to be found there” You will like the many colored
pictures and the outline picture to color.

All of this material comeS'to you for fifteen cents
plus a registration fee of $1.00 for each clubs This en~
titles your club to copies of Audubon Junior News and a
book, Nature Program Guide which furnishes many activities
for you tofollow°

 

.Join now and get the material for the entire school years

Cordially yours,

O YOU HAVE A 4’
*7 CANARY?

..... Well, then you are a very
fortunate girl or boy, because
a canary is such a cheerful pet.

 

Don't you love to hear him sing? When
he sings, watch his little throat move.

You can make friends with him just as you would with any
other kind of a pet, by being nice to him. Every morning,
before you go to school, talk to him. Stand with your
hands in back of you so that he will not be frightened by
any sudden movement. You will soon find that he will be
glad to see you. He will hop baCK-and—forth on his perches,
chirping, whenever he sees you.
Then, when you come home
from school, give him a piece of lettuce, or apple
as a treat. He cannot eat cake or candy or other

sweets as you do, but he enjoys his lettuce or apple
just as much.

GOOD F000 is just as
important for your
canary as it is for you.

Here are some of the
foods that your canary needs:

Always be sure that he has fresh food and water,

paper in the bottom of his cage has clean gravel
see,

and that the

on it. You
since he does not have any teeth he needs bird gravel to

grind up his food. Also, put a piece of cuttle bone between

the wires of his cage, for him to bite on, so that his bill
will not become too long.

Never tease him or allow anybody else to do so.

DO YOU HAVE A

 

Well, then you are a very
fortunate girl or boy.

A cat is clean and quiet and knows how to entertain himself.
When he is outdoors and sees a leaf blowing in the breeze,
he loves to play with it. When he is in the house, if he
finds a piece of paper or string, he enjoys playing with it
just as much as if it were a real toy. He seems to make up

is another animal, because he sneaks up on it, then pretends

To enjoy your cat the most, and to make him glad that he is your pet, here are
a few nice things that you can do for him to help him to keep well and happy.

Try to let your cat have his own way as much as you can. of
course, if he has any bad habits, such as climbing up on the
furniture, you must not let him do that. But if he does not
want you to pick him up, do not do so. lf he does not want
you to pet him, leave him alone. When he seems to be tired
of playing, do not try to make him, because that will make
him cross.

When you do play with him, play gently so that
you will both have fun. Never slap him when you are playing, _
and never pull his tail or his whiskers. If he does something that he should not,
such as jumping up on the furniture or sharpening his claws on furniture, pick him

up and move him away each time.

Comb and brush him every day, and he will purr when he seee the comb!

DO YOU BKVE A BABY TURTLE?

'Well, then you are very fortunate, because a baby turtle is an interesting
pet. But.......a turtle needs special care if he is to live for a long time.

Do not let him.get cold. Keep him in a warm.room, but do not keep him.in
front of a window because sunlight coming through window glass is too warm
and can actually kill a turtle! The bowl in which he is kept should have

a rock or a piece of floating wood so that he can get out of the water
whenever he wants to.

Sometimes a turtle does not want to get out of the water. But if he stays
in water all the time his shell is apt to get very soft. So take him.out
of the water at night and put him.in a shoe box without a lid.

Change your turtle's water about three times a week and remember that he
eats IN THE WATER.

Good food is just as important for your turtle as it is for you. Here are
some of the foods that your turtle needs.

RAW OR COOKED MEAT
RAW OR COOKED FISH
RAW OR COOKED LIVER
MEAT LOAF
MEAI.WORMS

If you should ever find a large turtle do not bring him.home, because he
would not be happy living in captivity. If you put him in your yard he
would probably get away and.maybe get hit by a car.

, ..WELL, EVEN SO YOU CAN HAVE
0’“ 011 t have a pat JUST AS MUCH FUN AS THE GlRL
“‘ . OR BOY WHO DOES HAVE A PET !
Why don't you go to the zoo and decide which animals are the most interesting?
After you have done that, wouldn't it be fun to go to the LlBRARY and borrow
books with stories about them? Once upon a time there was a man who wrote some
fairy stories about animals, and the name of one of these stories
is "How the Elephant Got His Trunk”, Did you ever read it?
You will find it in JUST—SO STORlES, by Rudyard Kipling.

Whenever you go to the Z00, NEVER tease any of the animals.
Do not FEED any of the animals whose cages have "Do Not Feed"
signs on them, because the animals might get sick.

Do you ever go to Golden Gate Park to watch the
squirrels? See how close you can get to them
without frightening them. Never do anything to startle them. Some
children, and grownups who do not know any better, think that it is
fun to frighten animals. But what fun could there possibly be in
frightening animals. ““"””

Ask Mother and Daddy to get you a small camera, so that you can
learn to take pictures of animals. Also ... get a book about
birds, so that you can learn the names of the ones that you see
on your way to school...

or in the Park...
zsﬁ’ or in the Country...
THEN, some day, if Mother or right in your yard!
tells you that she saw a bird ¢‘V
about the size of a robin, but mostly all
brown, you can tell her that probably it is a towhee.

if there are some animals, such as snakes, that you do not like, do not harm them.
Remember that there are many snakes that cannot hurt you in any way. For instance,
Garter Snakes and Gopher Snakes are very useful, because they eat bugs and rats and
mice and gaphers, which could do a lot of harm in gardens. if you come across an
animal that you do not like, just go away and leave it alone.

You don't have a pet? Well, YOU CAN HAVE FUN JUST THE SAME!

Well, then you are a very fortunate girl or boy, because a
budgie can give his owner so much pleasure. A budgie is

he were to get away.

Sparrows and robins and jays and wrehs and other wild

Always be sure that he has fresh food and water and that the paper in the
bottom of his cage has clean gravel on it. Since he does not have teeth,
the gravel helps him to grind up his food. Put a piece of cuttle bone
between the wires of his cage, for him to bite on, so that his bill will
not become too long.

DO YOU HAVE A hHITE RAT?

‘Well, then you are very fortunate, because a white rat is clean and most
of the time he is good—natured.

Since his cage is his home you Should.be Very careful of the kind of cage
that you have for him.

A big bird cage would be fine, EXCEPT he might push the wires apart and get
caught. 50 if he is to live in a big bird cage be sure that the cage is strong
and that there are no little loose pieces of wire on which he might hurt him~
self. Also fasten the doors with a piece of wire or with a tiny padlock be-
cause a white rat is a very good door—opener:

An almost square aquarium is a fine cage for a white rat. If he is to live
in an aquarium, be sure to have a screen top made for it. Screen nailed to
a wooden frame makes a good top for an aquarium” Be sure the wooden frame
fits down over the aquarium.

ALL ANIMALS HAVE SOME KIND OF ODOR and if you do not keep your white rat's
cage clean, his odor can become very unpleasant. So be sure to take time to
clean your white rat's cage EVERY DAY. Take out the soiled newspaper and
put in several thicknesses of clean newspaper that you have torn to fit the
cage. Then put in long strips of newspaper for the white rat to use as a

blanket.

EVERY DAY be sure to wash his dishes and give him fresh water to drink. If
he spills his water or walks in it or puts pieces of paper in it, give him
his water in a bottle. A vinegar bottle makes a good drinking bottle. But
be sure to wash it and rinse it well before you use it. Then make a hole
in the cover. Leave the cardboard lining in the cover, otherwise the water
might LEAK! Just put the bottle on its side in the cage and whenever the
white rat is thirsty he will lick the hole. Be sure to change the water
EVERY DAY and to wash the INSIDE of the bottle so that it will not become
dirty,

YOu will find that your white rat will learn to know you. 'When you come home

from school and walk over to his cage, doesn't he act as if he is glad to see you?
He sits up on his hind legs, sniffing as he looks about. Doesn't he look

almost like a tiny kangaroo?

NEVER, NEVER forget that good food is just as important for your white rat as
it is for you.

Here are some of the foods that your white rat needs.

PABLUM WITH MILK SUNFLOWER SEEDS APPLE
‘WHOLE WHEAT BREAD WITH HONEY COOKED MEAT CABBAGE
RAISINS DOG BISCUITS CARROTS SWEET POTATO

Put a piece of wood in his cage for him to chew on, because his teeth GROW and
G R O W and. G R O W all the time and the piece of wood will keep them
from.becoming too L O N G.

NEVER stick your finger in front of his mouth, because he might decide to chew
your finger!

Some people DO NOT LIKE WHITE RATS, so NEVER show your pet to anybody who
might not like him.




DO YOU HAVE GOLDFISH OR GUPPIES?
‘Well¢ then you.are very fortunate, because a fish is an interesting pet.

A fish lives in an aquarium.which should.be a glass box that holds water. A
round bowl is not as good as a rectangular tank that you.may buy at any pet
shop.

Keep special gravel in the bottom.of aquarium.and be sure to have some plants

growing in it because they help to make oxygen and they are also a "salad"
for your fish!

Guppies are so small that several may be kept in an aquarium. But if your
mother guppy has babies, separate them.immediately. But it is better to keep
just one or two goldfish in an aquarium.because if they are the least bit
crowded they are apt to die.

Do not change the water very often. Water does not need to be changed just
because it is green. Change it when it is cloudy. One or two snails help to
keep an aquarium.clean, because they are like tiny garbage collectors. Be

sure that the snails are alive, because dead snails would poison the water
and kill the fish.

When you have to change the water, DO NOT USE WATER RIGHT FROM THE FAUCET,
because this water contains something to kill germs. This does not harm.us,
but it can kill fish. When water stands for a day or so it is safe for fish,
so keep some water in jars fer your fish.

Very carefully pick up your fish in a small net and put them into one of the
jars. BE SURE TO USE THE NET because a fish could be easily injured by handling

it with your fingers. Some of the tiny scales might come off and cause the
fish to die.

Next, take out the snails and plants. Then empty the gravel on newspaper. Ask
your mother where to pour the dirty water. Scrub the aquarium with paper

towels until it is clean, but NEVER USE SOAP. Rinse the plants and gently scrub
the snails’ shells with an old toothbrush and rinse them under a faucet. Ask

your mother if there is some new gravel for you to use, or if you are to rinse
the old gravel.

Feed your fish once or twice a week. Tiny pieces of fish food is all that they
need. Be sure that all of the bed is eaten, because if any left it will spoil
in the water and cause the fish to die. ‘When fish have had enough to eat,

they spit out the food.

 




DO YOU HAVE A HAMSTER?

Well, then you are very fortunate, because a hamster is such a lovable little
pet. When he sits up on his hind legs doesn‘t he look like some kind of toy?
His paws look like tiny pink hands, don't they? He loves to fill his cheek

pockets with food, and when he empties them.he pats his cheeks with his paws.

He is usually very gentle and likes to be held carefhlly, but
HE DOES NOT LIKE OTHER HAMSTERSI

So be sure to let him live in his cage ALL BY HIMSELF, because he thinks of it
as his very own home. No other animal is welcome. A mother hamster is nice
to her hamster children for a time, but after a while she acts as if they were
strangers and they must be taken out of her cage. IF you should ever have two
hamsters, KEEP THEM IN SEPARATE CAGES!

An almost square aquarium makes a good hamster cage, but it must have a screen
top. Screen nailed to a wooden frame makes a good aquarium.cover. Be sure the
wooden frame fits down over the top of the aquarium.

A bird cage makes a good cage for a hamster, EXCEPT he might push the wires
apart and get caught. So if your hamster is to live in a bird cage be sure to
see that the cage is strong and that no loose wires are there to hurt the little
pet. Also, fasten the door with a piece of wire or with a tiny padlock because
a hamster is a very good door~0pener£

Although a hamster is a clean animal, ALL animals have some kind of odor so it is
very important for you to keep his cage clean. EVERY DAY take out the soiled
newspaper and put in several thicknesses of clean newspaper that you have torn

to fit the cage. Then put in long strips of newspaper for the hamster to use

as a bed and as a blanket. A hamster takes long naps in the daytime and wakes
up in the late afternoon.

If he spills his water or walks in it or puts pieces of newspaper in it, give
him water in a bottle. A vinegar bottle makes a good drinking bottle. But be
sure to wash it and rinse it well. Then make a hole in the cover. Leave the
cardboard lining in the cover, otherwise the water might leaki Just put the
bottle on its side in the cage and.whenever the hamster is thirsty he will
lick the hole. Be sure to wash the inside of the bottle EVERY DAY so that it
will not become so dirty that it is slippery inside. He must have fresh water
EVERY DAY.

Good food is just as important for your hamster as it is for you. Here are some
of the foods that your hamster needs. What are some of the foods that YOU need?

PABLUM WITH MILK SUNFIOWER SEEDS EmW‘PEANUTS

...The best way to make people like your dog, is

you can take him riding in the car.

There are some

'What is Fundamental in Education?
An Editorial, Courtesy’Mass. S.P.C.A. Boston.

There is no doubt that many an educator looks upon what is called "Humane Education"
as a more or less trivial affair. Throughout our schoOls and colleges at the present
day there runs primarily the idea that the training of the intellect is the chief
thing to be sought. It needs but a slight knowledge of history to be aware of the
fact that the advantages that come to one as a result of education in the higher
branches of learning are no guarantee of moral character or of good citizenship.

Some of the greatest crimes of history have been committed by men of keen intellec-
tual power and wide knowledge.

It may be doubted if any thoughtful man will deny the assertion that the springs of
action and the forces that determine conduct are to be found in what may justly be
called "man's emotional nature". All the things that make for character have their
seat there. Justice, compassion, friendship, goodwill, the spirit that binds man to
man, that works for peace, and stands over against what seems to be nature's law of
the survival of the fittest, come to us out of that realm that humanity has ever
Spoken of as "the heart". 'Wherever, therefore, the chief aim of the educator has
been to train the intellect, neglecting this other side of man's being, he has missed
the supreme goal that should have been the aim of his calling.

Humane Education, while recognizing the value of scientific, literary, and philosophr
ical training, seeks to go deep enough into the life of the younger generations to
reach the home of those emotions and impulses which are the determining factors in
the development of human character.

Unless back of all that our schools and colleges are so largely seeking, there is an
awakened sense of justice and kindness, those who issue from these institutions may
use what they have acquired only for the destruction of the highest social and
industrial welfare of their state and nation. Teacher after teacher has borne
witness to the truth that the child trained to deal with the animal world about him
according to the teaching of the Golden Rule inevitably grows into manhood constantly
moved to apply this same law in determining his relations to his human fellows.

Miss Dorothy Lee Graves, President of the Lauderdale County Humane Society, Meridian,
Miss., Mrs. E. N. Halbrunt, President of the Knoxville County Humane Society,
Knoxville, Tenn., Miss Mable Crafts, President of the Jacksonville Humane Society,

and W. R. Boyd, President of the Chatham-Savannah Humane Society, Savannah, Ga., have
definite dates during 1953 for the introduction of HUmane Education to the teachers in
the City or County area under their respective jurisdiction.

J. C. Fincher is the President of the newly organized Humane Society of Gadsden, Ala.
Congratulations to him and his co-workers are certainly in order.

w. R. Boyd, President of the Chatham-Savannah Humane of Savannah, Ga., has completed
a City-Society Contract for stray dog control. This was completed November lst,
1952. Congratulations on a new kennel and efficient personnel.

C. L. Cline, President of the HUmane Society of Southwest Louisiana, announces that
the society on January lst., 1953 had contracted with the City of Lake Charles for
~§traydog control. The new shelter and personnel are ready for action. Mr. Cline
was a member when the Lake Charles Society was organized on March 12, 1952. Fast
and good work. Dr. Mark Quilty, Jr., the EAR Representative, Mrs. Donna Hickman,
Mrs. A. L. Morrow and Mrs. C. L. Cline were among several who were helpful in the
organization. Mr. Cline boasts of 600 members.

The two training institutes for shelter operators conducted by Messrs. Mel Morse and
Larry Andrews of Albany, N. Y., in Jacksonville, Fla., and Atlanta, Ga., last fall,
were most successful. Representatives from 32 areas were present. Many requests have
come in for this additional service to the societies and for a repeat training
institute.

Mrs. Virginia Bridges of the Hinds County Humane Society (Jackson, Miss) and her co-
workers have accepted the honor of being host to the next area training institute to
be held the last week in February. (watch for date of special letter). By all means
plan to have your shelter workers attend these informal, instructive round table
meetings. No fees and no speeches, just be present.

to keep it up".

 

DOUISIANA: NEW ORLEANS: Two outstanding examples of successful pioneering in Humane
Education activities were announced by Frank Hayne, President of the
Lao S.P.C.A. when the K-9 President Club took over from the La. S.P.C.A.
complete promotion of National Dog Week activities. The second example
was when the Parish of Jefferson (adjoining New Orleans) requested to be
allowed to take up the La. S.P.C.A. Humane Program in that areao The
efforts of the La. S.P.C.A. will be centered on another parish and in
other fields said Mr. Hayne.

BATON ROUGE: A feature story of the history, activity and promotional
plans of the East Baton Rouge SPCA was outlined in the Merning Advocate
of Nov. 16, 1952. This is a tribute to Mrs. Mary Fitzgerald, the
efficient Secretary.

MISSISSIPPI: GULFPORT: A new shelter has been completed and the society has been
extended to include all of Harrison Countyo The Rabies Control for the
County will be co-ordinated with the society's program. Mrs. C. 0.
Brown is Secretary and can be found at h612 West Beach, Gulfport, Miss.

 

NATCHEZ: Mro Lawrence Jungling was re—elected President and will
continue the City Society Shelter plans.

HATTIESBURG: Miss Dorothy Lenoir, Secretary of the Forest County Humane
Society is planning a newspaper series of stories for "Be Kind To
Animals Week", May 3-9.

GADSDEN: was organized December 2, 1952 and will be active in "Be Kind
To Animals Week", May 399. (See organization item this issue.) There
are 5 active organizations in Alabama, namely, Montgomery, Mobile,
Birmingham, Florence and of course, Gadsden.

ANNISTON: Mrs. Sarah Shaden is interested in an organizational program.
GEORGIA: SAVANNAH: The Board‘s social part of the program was held on roof

garden of the Whitney Hotel during November. Dutch, of course, but a
good idea and very friendly jesture. (See item elsewhere this issue).

FLORIDA: JACKSONVILLE: The penthouse atop the Mayflower Hotel was the meeting
‘_- place after the recent November Board Meeting. This is really humane
activity at work. (See item elsewhere this issue). Mr. & Mrs. wm.Bower
have extended the HUmane Services in the City and County. Assisting
President Mable Crafts were Mesdames Ivan Smith, India Woods, W. I.
Van de Velde and many others.

MIAMI: Mr. & Mrs. Charles Pusey have had considerable success in
collecting additional funds by locating boxes throughout the city. Get
details from Mrs. Pusey, 2101 N.W. 95th St.

N. CABQLINAi GREENSBORO: Mrs. Paul Anderson, 1119 Cornwallis Drive has been elected
President of a group to organize and promote humane activities. She
has been greatly assisted by Ray Wilcox, Jim Nemmack, and many

others.

TENNESSEE: HUMBOLDT: H. L. Shannon of 310 S. 19th Street is heading up Organiza-
tional plans. He will be assisted by Hon. H. J. Foltz, the Mayor.

LONDON: ENGLAND: A letter in part from Catherine Brockhunt, Secretary of the
Anglo-Italian Society for the Protection of Animals Ltd., mentions that
the literature used in our Educational Course has arrived and will be of
the greatest value to them, and when studied thoroughly, she will send
it to Mr. Johnson in Italy. The Humane Educational plan as outlined and
used in the Southeast Area has a footing in Canada and now in Italy, via
London, England.

JUST AS IT CAME TO ME

1. Appoint your committee for "Be Kind To Animals Week" activities (May 3-9).

2. Prepare newspaper articles against "colored chicks" for Easter Time.

3. Your radio, newspaper could use a Spring formular for the care, handling and

feeding of pets in the home. (See your Veterinarian).

h. Watch for dates of the next training institute for shelter workers in Jackson,
NIiSS o

5. Check the equipment, program, physical assets, etc., for the Spring and Summer
grind. ‘

6. A recent summary shows that Louisiana has 3 active societies, Mississippi has 8
active societies, Alabama has h active societies. (Survey for other areas
will be completed for next issue).

7. The best adult education is through the child. Plan a Humane Educational School
Program. Societies should include all phases of humane activities in their
promotional plans.

8. Invite some public or interested person to your next board meeting. Plan
something of mutual interest.

9. A yearly subscription of the National Humane Review is an excellent way to speak
$0 someone twelve times per year for only $1.50. (If a member of A.H.A.
-l.10 .

10. The Annual Report of your humane activities should make a good newspaper feature
story or the reason for a Board Member to address your local civic clubs.

11. Fred Myers, (Editor of the National Humane Review and Shelter Shoptalk) idea of
sending the names of your shelter personnel to him for possible use in ShOp-
talk is excellent. If you are a member of the American Humane Association,
this is all free. If you are not a member, write Fred and he will tell you
how easy it is to get copies of Shelter Shoptalk for your personnel. (See
item elsewhere in this issue).

12. A recent survey by'the La. S.P.C.A. was made to determine the trend of the Humane
activities. The following partial summary of the report may help many to the
answer of their own problems.

a. Does your society have contract with city or county for stray dog control?
Answer, 12 no, 16 yes.

b. Do you issue licenses or through city or county? Answer, 19 City or
county only, 6 both, 1 society only, 1 county only.

c. If question 2 is "yes", do you retain the fee? Answer, 1 no, 2 yes,
2-85%, 1-20%.

d. What salary do you pay drivers? Answer, $h5.00 to $75.00 per week, 1
gives 20% of collections.

e. What system do you use in catching dogs? Answer, Predominately gloves,
leash, and ropes, 2 use nets.

f. Cost of license per year, male, female, neuter. Answer, 18 increased
female; 8, all one fee. Fees ranging from $1.00-$2.00-$l.00 to $3.00,
$5.00, $3.00.

 




g. Do license expire yearly or date to date? Answer, 27 yearly, 1 date to
date.

h. Are license and or vaccination compulsory? Answer, 9 both, 1? license
only.

i. What is approximate dog pOpulation? Answer, In proportion to human
population.

3. Does your society receive a certain yearly income from City or County?
Answer, 9 no, 13 stipulated amounts.

13. The name of the Red Star Animal Relief has been changed to Emergency Animal Relief
(E:A.R.). In all cases of emergency, where animals are concerned, the society
nearest to the stricken area will be asked to cooperate. In the states of
Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi and Florida, in area where there is not an
established society, the veterinarian representing the E.A.R. will be in
charge. Elsewhere in this issue is the E.A.R. plan of procedure. In.any
emergency notify the area director, H. H. Treleaven, in New Orleans for
activity coordination.

‘WHY A CHILD NEEDS A PET

The urge for universal Humane Education is claiming attention.by the civilized world.
Prdbably the world's fundamental need today is more culture of the heart, more
reverence, more thought and consideration to others, more of the true humane spirit
applied to the art of living. It is vastly important to cultivate in the receptive
minds of boys and girls those principles of kindness, justice, fair play Upon which
happiness and stability of society depends.

We cannot begin too early to train our youth in a kindly attitude towards all the
lowly creatures. There is perhaps no element of character more vital to happiness
than a spirit of kindliness and I know of no better way to develop this kindly
spirit than by teaching children kindness to animals, through the child's chumship
with a living peto Animal pets for children are necessary if the children are to
have a well rounded education and a normal society adjustment. Living pets have a
definite place in teaching children patience, tolerance, understanding and consider-
ation for others. It must be remembered that no child can be kind to the humble
creatures without developing the above character building traits.

 

The Children's Aid Society of Cleveland, Ohio, reports that while they provided
psychiatric, psychologic case work, dental, medical nursing and teaching service for
children, they needed a basic program which invited new satisfaction and a basic
meaning for life. Finally they tried an activity that was found even of greater
value to the children than all the other activities. Animal Pets were introduced
into the programo From this came hours of effort at building hutches, boxes, etc.,
the understanding of sex as a normal natural function in nature and a real vital
interest in animal feeding which drained off much of their concern about themselves.

One of the most important functions of the humane society is the restoration of pets
to young owners. Many a youngster has had a gladdened heart with the return of his
or her pooch. This is companionship plus and one reason why a child needs a pet.

I regret the interminable delay in reefcnding to your
January letter. With the tressure of work to he done my
calender is filled solid weeks in advance. I do hope we may
have a get-tcmgether sometime when you are in New York and

when we know of your coming considerably in advance.

  
           
    
 

I agree thst helpful material is needed for c
tezchers. This should include guides for teachers 0
education, content material a d suggested uses. The
two general approaches that may guide the organization if
material. One is the "Learning About Reproach" in which a
direct presentation of information on a given topic is
presented. The other is the "Problem to be Met" in which
suggestions for ﬁlanning pet shows or helps in attracting birﬂs in
wintertime or some such essential information are organized in
a unit. ’6

      
             
    
    
   
     
    

The interest in most topics on conservation runs high with

Do YOU KNow how
many different kinds of
plants there are in the
world? That’s a hard ques- , '
tion to answer, for it would ,
be almost impossible to

list them. Most plants help

man in one way or another.

Some are used for clothing,

some for shelter, and still

others for food.

Just What happens to a seed when it is planted in
the soil? How does it grow? Where does it get

its food?

When you plant a seed, you
really plant stored—up food,
because the seed has within
itself the energy1 for growth.
When it is ﬁrst placed in the
soil, the seed takes in water
equal to half its weight. As
it begins to grow, the seed
uses the food that is stored
inside it. And the soil helps
in the growth of the young
seedling by supplying miner—
als and water.

 

1. Energy—Strength or force.

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

T ‘ : ‘N‘raésng _« M x 9... ,5

i}-

 

As the seed grows, the
roots develop. The
leaves and stem break
through the soil, and
the young plant is soon
able to take care of it—

self.

 

 

HOW does the plant get
this food from the soil?
Tiny hairs, called root
hairs, grow from the ﬁnest
roots when they are be—
ginning to sprout. These
root hairs grow into the
soil and take in food that
has been dissolved in wa-
ter. They have no holes
or openings, so solids can-
not enter. But liquid food
can pass through the very
thin tissue. From the root
hair, the food is carried
inside the plant.

Root hairs do not grow on the larger, coarser
roots, so these roots do not take in food for the

(3)

 




plant. It is the job of the bigger room to carry the
food up into the plant after it has been taken in by
the root hairs.

Plants get their food
from the air as well as
from the soil. If you
burn a match, you will
see that it turns black.
This black product into
which the match changes
is carbon. Every part of

g the plant contains car-
bon, and this is very im—
portant to it.

Leaves supply the plant with

1 carbon and oxygen by taking

l them in from gases in the air.
Green plants build these ele—
ments into plant foods, and
they can use them only in
sunlight. The green color in a
plant leaf is like a machine, and
the power to keep the machine
running comes from the sun—
light. The plant makes starch
and sugar from the carbon and
other elements it takes in.

 

(4)

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

3~4 #4: A A

 

Besides starch and sugar, plants make juices,
gums, woody ﬁber, oils, and proteins. Sometimes
plants use these foods right away, and [other times
they store them. When the food is used, two tube-
like passageways carry it to all parts of the plant.
One tube carries the liquid up, and the other carries
it down. Plants use some of theSe products as
energy for growth. Other produCts are stored up in
the seed, to be used later.

Where do plants come from?
All plants grow from either
a seed or a bud. Every plant
that has a seed produces a
ﬂower, though it may not
look like one. For instance,

    
 

‘N

the ear and tassel bear the
blossoms on a corn plant.

Look at a ﬂower closely.
See the green leaves on the
outside? These are the se-
pals, and they protected the

 

(5)

 




 

<6)

ﬂower while it was a bud. Next on the inside is a
row of colored leaves or petals. The shapes and
colors of the petals are very different in each kind
of plant.

,,...--9?51gmci Arranged inside the petals
_---gfame}1 are threadlike parts with a
knob on the end of each.
x, 1919th These slender, erect threads
oval“, are called stamens. Do you
-x‘ see the ﬁne powder on the
—-~-OV11'Y knob of a stamen? These
tiny specks are pollen, and
without them there would
be no seeds. At the center of the ﬂower and inside
the circle of the stamens is the pistil. The swollen
tip of the pistil is called the stigma, and the
swollen base is the ovary. In the ovary are young
seeds called ovules.

    
 

The ﬂowers on some plants have within them
all the parts they need to form a seed. That is, in
certain plants these necessary parts, the stamens
and pistils, are within one ﬂower. Some of the
other plants also have these two parts, but they
are not contained in one ﬂower. Instead, the sta-
mens are in one ﬂower and the pistils in another,
all on the same plants. Forexample, the tassel of
a corn plant is a cluster of many ﬂowers, each
bearing only stamens. The ear of corn is also




a cluster of many ﬂowers, each of which bears
only a pistil. The dust that falls from the tassel
is pollen, and the long silky threads or silks
on the ear are stigmas. There is a third kind of
plant whose ﬂowers have pistils on one plant and
stamens on the other.

Flowers that contain all the parts needed to form
a seed have stamens, stigmas, and pollen grains.
But all plants do not have such ﬂowers, and when
a plant does not have all the necessary parts, it
needs the help of another plant before it can form
seeds.

If a ﬂower does not have all these parts necessary
for producing seeds, it means that the pollen from
one ﬂower of the same kind must be carried to the
Stigma of another. How does this happen? Well,
there are two common ways, .

Sometimes the pollen from
one ﬂower is blown by the
wind to the stigma of an-
orher. Sometimes bees carry
pollen from one ﬂower to»
another as they ﬂy about in
search of nectar, from which
they make honey. Mother
Nature has provided the
ﬂowers with attractive col—
ors and perfumes so that the

 

(7)

 




 

' <8)

 

bee notices the ﬂower and stops to gather nectar

from it. As the bee works its way inside the petals

to get at the nectar, some of the pollen from the

knob on the stamen clings to its body. The bee

gathers the nectar, and then ﬂies off in search of

another ﬂower. When the bee ﬁnds one, it again

works its way inside the petals and as it does so,
some of the pollen picked up from the ﬁrst ﬂower

brushes off onto the stigma of the second ﬂower.

And so this second ﬂower has been “pollinated.”

After the pollen falls on the
stigma, a single pollen grain
begins to grow. It forms a
tiny opening, too small to see
with your eye, all the way
down through the stigma
into the ovary. This tiny
opening reaches down into

.the ovary, and a process

known as ”fertilization"1

takes place. Now this im-
mature seed grows and
forms the seed such as you
sow in your garden to form
a new plant.

    

 

ovuléf ,,

1. Fertilization—Joining together of cells from pollen grains and ovules in the ovary after
pollen has fallen on the stigma.

 

 

 




 

 

 

New plants may be grown from buds as well as
from seeds. A bud may form a new plant in vari-
ous ways. A branch bearing buds may be bent to
the ground and covered with soil. This is called
layering. Or, the bud may be cut away from the
branch and put in the soil to grow by itself.
When the bud is cut away from the plant like this,
it is called cutting. The third and last method is
budding. Budding means that a bud is cut from
the branch of one plant and is placed on the branch
of another plant to grow.

Throughout its life, the plant con-
tinues to produce energy in the form
of food. Only a small part of this
energy is used for its own growth.
Any food that the plant doesn’t need
to use right away is stored in the
seed, roots, stems, or other parts for
future use. These stored materials,
which the plant has built up with
the aid of energy from the sunlight
and simple substances from the soil
and air, make plants valuable to both
man and animals. Theplants’ store
of energy gives us vegetables such as
carrors, peas, corn, potatoes, beets,
and many more.

Some plants supply foods
that man can’t eat, but ani—
mals ﬁnd them as tasty as
we ﬁnd vegetables. This is
true of many grasses that
grow in our country. Hogs,
cattle, and sheep get their
food from them, and we in
turn get pork, beef, lamb,
and many other delicious
meats from these and other
meat animals. Without meat
our meals wouldn’t be very i’mdf’jd“
tasty, would they? t” '1

 

So we see that not only do we depend on plants
for the vegetables we eat but we depend on them
to nourish livestock so that we may enjoy meat.

THE STORY OF GRASS

What do you think of when you see a blade of
grass? It probably makes you think of spring . . .
or of baseball . . . or working in the ﬁeld or in the
garden. It probably doesn’t make you think of
food, does it? Well, a blade of grass is food.

 

It is food for'lots of animals. And in a roundabout
way it is food for us, too, though we may never
eat any of it directly.

'How can grass be food for us if we never eat it?

Well, that’s an interesting story.

.First of all, there are good reasons why people-do '

not eat grass the way some animals do. It has too
much water and not enough of other things in it
for people to live on and grow and be healthy. It

 

 

.44

 




 

 

has a lot of ﬁber1 and threadlike
material in it, too, and people can't
digestg this material very well.
Many animals can and do.

It all comes to this. Animals———
the ones that eat grass---can eat
different foods and grow and be
healthy. People just can't live on
grass. They aren't built that way.

But we said awhile back that
grass is food for people even when
they don't eat it. What did we
mean by that?

When we sit down to our dinner

table, we eat many different kinds

‘ of food. We may have vegetables and fruits, water
or milk, rolls or bread and butter, meat, eggs, or
cheese for our meal. Usually the main part of our
dinner is meat. But we never sit down to a dish of
grass. None of the things on the table even look as
if they might once have been grass. But that is
where we are wrong. Because the main part of our
dinner—--the meat—«can be traced back to grass.
Let’s see what we mean by that.

l. Fiber—threadlike parts of plants that man can't use for food.

2. Digest—change of foods in the stomach into material that the body can use to build

bones, teeth, and muscles.

 

 

<33




Take that steak or roast beef on the plate in front
of you now. How can we say that it was once
grass? Well, we all know that it was once a part

 
 
  

       
 

/¢,
.4“ . .

C" 0

of a calf, a real, live calf that grazed in the pastures
or on the western ranges where there was plenty of
sunshine. And now-—-here's the point—«the calf

 

lrved and was healthy and grew because it ate
good food-—~good cattle food, that is. It

(:4)

 

t"

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

changed the food it ate into
a strong, healthy body, into
tasty steaks and roasts. And
that food was-«that's right
---grass.

Not all of the food the calf
ate was grass, of course. But
by far the most of it was.
So that when we eat- beef—
steak and roasts, We're really

' eating food that was once -
grass. We're eating food that
the cattle changed from grass
into meat for us. And that '

is why we can say that grass is food for us even

though we may never eat any of it directly.

 

What was true for the calf and older beef animals

is also true for lambs from \\ . . ///

which we get lamb chops

Q 0‘“

 
 

they eat is grass, too, so that "
when we eat these kinds of ‘ @Q a
meat, we are really making \CD .
use of grass as food, too. ¢

     

But there is more to our
story than that. Let's find
out something about grass;
Where does it grow? Is it all
the same? Do farmers and

(5)

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

ranchmen plant it the way they
plant corn and other kinds of
grain crops, or does it just grow
by itself the way wild ﬂowers do?

There are more than a hundred
different kinds of grass. Of
course, the kind some of us know
best is the kind that we have in
yards around our houses. But
more important-«for food cer-
tainly--—are the other kinds of
grass that grow in pastures all

over the United States. Some

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  

grasses grow best in wet
places, others in ‘dry ones;
some do best in cool seasons,
others in warm ones. These
are the grasses that provide
most of the food for meat
animals like lambs and cattle.

As soon as the animals had eaten

Since grass is so important as food for meat animals,
the men who grow these animals today give special
care even to the wild grasses. In many places, grass is
aCtually planted, grown, and cared for so as to
make sure that animals will have enough to eat

without having to be moved around.

And since we cannot eat grass and since nothing
else will grow there, all of this land would be
wasted as far as food for people is concerned if we
didn’t raise our meat animals there.

How much land is there like that? How much land
is there that won’t grow anything but grass or hay
or other crops that animals can but people can't
very well eat? Well, almost half the land in the
country is like that. To be exaCt, there are779,-
000,000 (million) acres of land in the United
States that would grow little, if any, human food
if it were not for cattle and sheep. There are many
millions of acres of land in our country which can

 

 

 




be plowed and on which other crops could grow
but which are used to grow pasture1 and hay2 to
feed animals. In
other words,-al-
most half the land
in the country
would be wasted
if we didn’t use it
to raise grass and
to serve as pasture
for our animals.

 

Q 0 GRASS Although most of the beef and
\J lamb and some of the pork that

we eat comes from grass, hay,
and other forage3 crops, the ani-
mals that produce these meats
also eat grain. The United States
Department of Agriculture tells
us that more than 78 per cent of
the food eaten by beef cattle is
grass, hay, and dry roughagesl
tWith lambs, it is more than 95
per cent.

 

Pasture—ﬁeld of growing grass, or Other plants, used as food by animals.
’Ha}._,_-gmgg or Other plants that have been cut, dried, and stored for use in winter
Forage—“growing grass and plants used as food by livestock.

Roughageswhay, silage, corn fodder, and feeds ()thCr than grain for livestock.

Jakaalv—

And there’s another story to add
//// to the one about meat. We have

been talking about eating grass.
' How about drinkingit? Did you
know that the milk you drink
depends on grass, too? Well, it
does. We wouldn’t have much
milk in this country if we didn’t
give our cows lots of grass and
hay to eat, now would we?

  
    
  
   
 
   

4%
So grass is not only important to i 5
animals, but it is important to
us, too. Grass helps us to have ‘
milk and meat, cheese, and ice ‘ M| l k E
cream, and'a lot of other foods, ‘
too. And yet, if we tried to live
on grass ourselves, we would
probably starve. We need the
animals to change the grass into
food that we can eat, into milk
and meat.

 

 
   

 

 

 




 

 

 

So the next time you look at a blade of grass you
will know that you are looking at food. You are

looking at food for animals which the animals will

eat in order to make food for us. It is a good thing
for us to raise livestock to eat the grass and then

for us to eat the meat and milk and other foods
that come to us in this way.

The Code Goes to Camp

The concentrated Scouting at camp

affords a unique opportunity to

apply Promise and Laws to daily life

The Promise and Laws are standard
equipment for any activity or occasion in
Girl Scouting, but leaders find their
greatest challenge in making them come
alive for girls as practical guides to daily
living. No setting is more conducive to
teaching the meaning and application of
the Promise and Laws than the out-of-

doors, and there is no laboratory for prac-
ticing them like the girl-sized community
of camp.

If the camp setting is to be used effec-
tively for this purpose, leaders and coun-
selors will need to make girls realize that
camp is their own “community.” They
need to point out the relationship between
living together successfully at camp, and
life in their home community.

Scouts’ Own at Camp El-
O-Win, Fresno, California.

Some of this can be mentioned and dis-
cussed before girls go to camp, but the
learning—by-doing method in the actual
living situation will quickly make it real
and practical to them. .

The leader has an enviable position in
all of this, for at camp she can get closer
to girls—their deep-down thoughts, their
sense of values, and their real problems—
than anywhere else.

Ceremonies have always been recog-
nized as one of our best ways of teaching
the meaning of the Promise and Laws.
Any single day at camp provides a num-
ber of opportunities to use ceremonies, but
unless they are done consciously, with
time allowed for their meaning to take
root, they tend to become routine—and at
times even dull. Ceremonies should be
planned by the girls themselves, with
variety and flexibility. They must be kept
vital and interesting by constant reexam-
ination to see if they really are being used
as tools to sharpen girls’ understanding of
the ethical, code.

W hat can make the first line of the
Promise more meaningful than to stand at
attention round a flagpole on a bright
morning while the natural world sings and
the red, white. and blue of our country’s
flag unfurls against the lighter blue of the
sky? “Honor” and “duty to God and
country” are very real to girls at that mo-
ment—if they have helped plan the cere-
mony, taken some part in it, and if they
have taken time to dress properly, not
tumbled out of bed and caught up breath-
lessly with the line of formation just as it
started to move. These are the things that
determine the state of mind of girls, who
should come to the flag ceremony in-
volved, unhurried, and free to catch the
meaning of the moment.

The morning flag ceremony provides
the leader with a chance to give a
“thought for the day” and set the tone for
all that follows. This is common practice
among our sister Guides in many coun-
tries and proves effective in helping girls
apply the Laws to the activities of the
day. The mot d’ordre ( as the French—
speaking Cuides call it) can be a single
quotation that illustrates one Law for
the girls to think about and be governed
by. It might be a two- or three-minute
talk relating an incident that reveals the
application of the Promise or Laws to an
actual situation. It might be a brief men-
tion of the Girl Scout pin, its meaning in
a camp setting and the importance of
wearing it at camp.

Leaders who have never provided a
“thought for the day” may feel more com-
fortable reading it at first. The custom soon
becomes an enjoyable way for them to talk
easily with girls about the intangibles Of
Scouting and they will be able to do it
spontaneously. (Continued on page 36)

Is it spring where you are? For some
of you spring has come—perhaps gone.
For others the ground is still frozen, and
perhaps covered with snow. But there is
a time in the year, for all of us, when
spring is not only “in the air” but in our
hearts and souls. A time when “going
out” becomes a must. Walls press in on
us.

We say we need “the spring air,” but
what our beings long for is to have a part
in the coming again of another flowering
and borning year.

Spring is the time of little things. Some
of the seeds that fell last fall and winter
are breaking their jackets and sending out
roots and tiny leaves. We say “some” of
the seeds, because many will have fallen
where conditions are not right for them
and they may lie dormant for several
years until conditions are right—if ever.
Many will have been used as food by
birds and other animals. This is one of
nature’s magnificent provisions to carry
on a species and, at the same time, pro-
vide food for the growth of other things.

The mental picture of a person walking
out in the spring is of a figure with arms
outstretched and head held high. But
some of us walk with shoulders hunched
and head bowed, watching the ground, so
as not to miss an inch-high hemlock tree
or a baby daisy plant with only four
small fragile leaves. We see God in the
majestic—the sweep of a sunset, the gray
stone mountain, but God is with that wee
daisy plant, too.

Spring is the time of baby mammals,
though some kinds are born when the
winter months are still with us. It is not
easy to raise a family in the wild. Every
bit of food has to be found; none can be
purchased in a shop. Dangers are every-
where—for the wild parents as well as
their young. Human beings can help to
make the spring less hazardous by driv-
ing with greater care. It is bad enough
to kill a male mammal, but the loss of

nestled in some well-hidden nest that one
can never seem to find? Who will hear
their whimperings?

Spring is the time when birds are in-
tent on mating, nest-building, and feeding
hungry mouths. Hundreds of thousands
of parent birds are killed by cars every
year—especially in the spring. One bird
darts across the road and we miss it, but
a knowledge of nature should tell us that,
in all probability, another is following.
Sometimes a parent bird is in pursuit of
an insect or snatching a dead one from
the roadway—a morsel for one of those
hungry mouths. Or it may be collecting a
bit of grass, a twig, a piece of string, to
be put in a nest. Or perhaps parent birds
have taken their babies out among the
bushes along the road. So intent are they
on their jobs as parents that they wait
just one second too long and are mashed
or broken on the highway. Most human
beings do not know how quickly or within
what footage a car can stop when going at
a given speed; we cannot expect our wild
things to have this knowledge.

Spring is the time when small things
exert all their smartness in self-preserva-
tion. This is an instinct that seems to be
at war, inside their tiny selves, with
curiosity, which is a characteristic of most
young animals. An inch-high hemlock
cannot move out of the way of a foot, nor
can a daisy plant with four leaves. But
baby mammals and birds can scamper or
stay very still until the foot has passed.
Sometimes they nestle in the warmth ‘of
hands with a trust that is heart-breaking.
Sometimes they struggle to be free—
struggle for their lives with a bravery and
fearlessness that can be a lesson to human
life.

Go out in the spring! Go quietly.
Watch God’s nature world repopulating

, itself. Breathe in the freshness of this as

well as the air. Learn, as you can learn
nowhere else, the order of things. Let the
time of little things teach you that the
“full life” is a beautiful blending of free—
dom, responsibility, understanding of and
respect for the laws of nature, and a trust
in God. Nature can teach you this if you
will go quietly—and with seeing eyes.
THE END

of helping leaders give girls

adventure that they are ready for

h» hen you see the happy faces of
Brownies and hear their excited chatter
about troop meetings, you know they are
having good times together. When you
look deeper into what happens to girls in
the Brownie Scout program under good
leadership, you discover that belonging
to a troop means more than just good
times.

The greatest value in Girl Scouting for
a girl of Brownie age is in becoming an
accepted member of her own troop, and
having her full share in all troop plans
and activities, accomplishments and
failures.

Girls learn so much and grow so fast
in these three years! They are eager for
new experiences, while they continue to
enjoy many of the same activities carried
on in “bigger girl” fashion each year. They
want adventure—but adventure they are
ready for—adventure for seven-, eight-, or

Adviser.

Shells givc Brownies a first taste of the sea’s limitless adventure“

nine-year-olds, not that of older girls.

If you are a program committee mem-
ber, how do you interpret the needs of
children of this age, the largest group of
the Girl Scout membership? How do you
safeguard the girls in Brownie troops from
the disappointments that result from at-
tempting activities they cannot carry out
successfully? From exploitation in public
gatherings “to keep them from feeling left
out”?

All children accept the fact that there
are many experiences they cannot have
until they are older. They are willing to
wait if they have a satisfying program of
their own and if their affairs, which they
want to manage, are recognized as im-
portant.

Brownies know they don’t go troop
camping or on an overnight. They
haven’t the ability, experience, or camp-
ing skills for such an undertaking. Out-
door troop activities and a program
planned for them in the established or day
camp are quite different.

There is another happy adventure in
good troop program that can be made
possible for Brownies by their troop
leaders, parents, and troop committee
members with the help of the Girl Scout
council program committee. This is the
Brownie Holiday.

A Brownie Holiday is a well—planned

period of troop living away from home,
with the adults in charge taking full re-
sponsibility for the girls, the place, the
arrangements, and the necessary work in-
volved. It is not a troop camp, an over-
night, nor merely a house party.
Spending a weekend, several days, or
perhaps a week in vacation time together
at a cottage, a farmhouse, or an adequate
troop cabin can be made a valuable and
happy experience for both Brownie Scouts
and adults. Being away from home with
troop friends and adults they know is a
happy way for girls to prepare for the
joys and satisfactions of future camping.
At the same time it is a real adventure.
The Brownie Holiday is an extension of
troop program, with greater opportunities
for the girls to help make and carry out
plans and accept responsibility for the
small tasks they are capable of doing. It
provides them with additional experience
in learning how to get on with each other
through living together, with each girl
doing her share and observing routines
necessary to making things run smoothly.
The leaders, with the help of the par-
ents, determine when the girls are ready
for such an experience. Activities and
discussions leading up to it are carried on
at troop meetings. The program is
planned with the girls, and the place itself
is considered in (Continued on page 30)

(f3) SERVICE TO OTHERSras every Cirl Scout
knows, is implicit in the. Promise and
Laws. It is interesting to hear of the different
ways in which troops in many parts of the
country are carrying on service activities.

In Olympia, \Vashington, Troop 16' of the
Capitol Area Council proves that “a Girl
Scout is a friend to animals” by taking an
active part in the work of the local Humane
Society. \Vhen the Society sponsored a sale
of old books and records the girls, in addi-
tion to making their own personal contribu-
tions, helped collect donations from other
members of the community. \Vith funds from
their troop treasury they bought paint for
the kennels and a supply of feeding dishes for
the animals. \Vhen they undertook to collect
newspapers for use in the cages, they were
surprised to discover how much paper is
needed to keep cages fresh and clean.

\Vhile the troop was preparing Christmas
stockings for patients in the children’s ward
at Madigan Hospital, the girls took time to
make some stockings—stuffed with bones,
balls, catnip mice, and rubber toys—for the
animals at the shelter. Instead of having a
party, the troop Visited the shelter to deliver
food and stockings for the big dogs and the
little dogs, the cats and kittens, and the other
animals being cared for there.

For a meeting of their Girl Scout Council
Troop 16 told the story of their Visit to the
shelter in a table display. \Vith pipe cleaners
and modeling clay the girls made miniature
cages, kennels, runways, and tiny clay ani-
mals. On the ﬂoor of each cage was a layer
of newspaper and a tiny feeding dish. Minia-
ture stockings were hung here and there.
Little piles of newspapers were a reminder of

a simple way to support the Societys work.

Helping the Humane Society has proved to
be an interesting and very worthwhile year-
round activity for this troop

C?) THE onus or moor 25 of the Hamp-
ton, Virginia, Council willlregister this
fall as Senior Scouts. They l1 ve been in
Scouting since Brownie days, and are looking
forward to the Wider fields which will be
open to them as Seniors. It is interesting to
hear that the troop still corresponds with two
girls, one in Finland and the other in Ger—

many, to whom they began to write when

they were Brownies.

The service activities of Troop 25 have
been many and varied. They make cookies
for the various soldier organizations in their
area, and for the \VACs at Fort Monroe.
They have worked with the Community
Chest and the Cerebral Palsy Center, and
make regular holiday visits to a local hospital
with gifts and to entertain the patients.

One of their activities might suggest an
idea to other troops. \Vith money from their
treasury they bought large, bright—colored
gummed labels, on which they had printed
telephone numbers for emergency use: the
Fire and Police Departments; numbers of
several doctors; the number to be called for
an ambulance and hospital assistance.

The girls distributed these labels from
house to house in their nieghborhood, sug-
gesting that they be pasted on directories or
telephone pads.

The expense and effort were well repaid
sometime later when, as the troop members
were leaving their meeting place, the care-
taker of the building suffered a heart attack
on the steps. Thanks to the labels, one of
the girls was able to give the emergency
ambulance number immediately, and help
was obtained without delay.

MAKING KITS FOR KOREA and con-

tributing to the Juliette Low \Vorld
Friendship Fund have been part of the inter—
national friendship activities of Troop 14 of
the DuBois, Pennsylvania, Coilncil.

The troop’s major service—t(1‘+otlrers project
at home has been the adoption of an eight-
year-old victim of polio. \Vith funds raised
through calendar sales, the troop has bought
clothing, books, and toys for their adopted
sister. The little girl is now receiving hospital
treatment in Pittsburgh, and the girls of
Troop 14 write her regularly, send holiday
greetings and gifts. The nurses at the hospital
have written to tell the girls how much their
friendship has helped the child, and how
happy they ha\ e made her.

If the girls are in uniform, make sure they
are looking their best: ties properly tied,
waistlines trim; hems‘ even (no slips show-

FACTUAL INFORMATION ON HUMANE EDUCATION
IN THE LATELY REVISED COURSE OF STUDY
FOR THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA

The emphatic clear cut declaration by Dr. Francis B. Haas,
Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, constituted a pronouncement of the need for a new
era in practical education. To accomplish this purpose, we note
that education leaders were summoned to evaluate available assets
and re—write the course of study. In his preliminary instructions
Dr. Haas stresses urgent need of “PERSONALITY GROWTH FOR
THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD” and “A BETTER BEHAVIOR CON-
CEPT.” With rare vision he elaborates his pronouncement:

“A major responsibility of the school, in addition to individual
development, is to provide experiences that will produce better be—
havior and, at the same time, ﬁt the child for effective living in a
democratic social order.

“We need a curriculum organized on the basis of units of work
which are taken from the great areas of human experience and the
world of natural phenomena.”

On the merit of this encouragement, humane education in its
basic purpose is visualized in the following statement which stresses
the humane viewpoint for those responsible for its teaching and
character development:

“We hold as self evident the proposition that every child is
endowed with qualities to motivate desirable behavior toward the
life about him, to make effective his inherent desires for the well—
being of the creatures in his environment, and to help him choose
the ways of justice, mercy, truth and kindness.

“We recognize the importance of humane education in the school
program as it serves to direct the potential forces of mind and body
toward the realization of a better self.

“We accept the interpretation that the study of the humanities
affects thought and action to the improvement of the individual’s
behavior toward man and beast and to the improvement of character.

“We see in humane education the expressionbf the pattern for
ideal living and for the advancement of civilization,

“We hold that by responsible activity and understanding in the
study of animal life, the individual may develop a noble philosophy
of life in which the world of creatures provides a laboratory for
classiﬁcation, identiﬁcation and practical service in the care, pro—
tection and conservation of all that is best in a living world.”

In an aggressive high school science course of study, Dr.
Frederick L. Pond, Supervising Curriculum Consultant for the
Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction, pioneered the
teaching of the humanities on the secondary school level. The ap-~
peal for basic thinking in this project is noted as follows:

“The teaching of the HUMANITIES is far more intricate than
simple justice toward the creature world, or than the measure of pain
and suffering administered. Its major virtue is the impact on the
human heart that man may be more nearly what he ought to be.
Human excellence is on a higher level than the maxim — “CRIME
DOES NOT PAY.” It depends on the motivating force that may

[1]

 




 

halt the crime of cruelty even though it costs something to be good.
In every contact with a living world, or in the functioning of a
democratic way of life, one must choose right above might, and
human excellence above the glitter of gold.

“In our limitations of perfection we may at times have to choose
between two evils, but the choice and the ideal must be the noblest
and the best within our command. We may teach a lesson on economy,
the production of marketable meat, fur, feather or hide, the trap line
or the hunt, or it may be a lesson on the grandeur of nature and
beauty, or the thrills of sportsmanship in a living world, but to at—
tain the humane goal we must seek the action of man at his best.
This “best” must ever be directed toward the nobility of THE GOOD
SAMARITAN. The teacher and the student who make this appli—
cation will attain the sum and substance of the humanities on the
level of higher education.

“CONSERVATION is intimately tied in with problems of hu-
manity. Any outstanding animal life problem may relate itself
to conﬂicts where material interests are likely to dominate over good
judgment. The teacher must, at all times, purpose to relate the basic
standards of humanity in dealing with conservation.”

The following outlines in the Pennsylvania High School Science
Course of Study constitute the frame work for the teaching of
humane education on the secondary school level:

HUMANE EDUCATION FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
Orientation by teacher and planning with pupils
Suggested activities: Pupil investigations and reports
1. A Study of Organizations

The studies under this topic should be considered for both
rural and urban schools. Part of these assignments may be chosen
for composition and theme work. They may also be coordinated
with biology, civics, nature study, and out-of—door projects. The

creature world and the out-of—doors become the laboratory for
ﬁrst-hand observation.

a. Note the scope of local organizations, their aims and purposes-

b. A representative of an organization may appear before the
group, or a student may be assigned to seek interviews and make
reports. If the organization has equipment, activities, or ﬁeld

projects, individuals or groups may be assigned to report on
ﬁrst-hand observations.

c. Check your community for the following:

Izaak Walton League Fur traders
Audubon Societies Trapping industry
Sportsmen’s organizations Government regulations on

HUMANE EDUCATION FOR SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
1. OVERVIEW BY TEACHER AND PLANNING WITH PUPILS

A major study of conservation with an outlook to the
future of man’s well-being as well as that of the creature world
should become a motivating inﬂuence in cultivating the
democratic way of life.

2. LEARNING ACTIVITIES
a. Extinction

A study of the disappearance of species or forms of life

from the face of the earth is both enlightening and inspiring.

Humane considerations will take on a new lease of interest.

The high school student will proﬁt by special assignment for

available information through geological studies. Nature has

written these records with imprints of permanence and ac—

curacy more reliable than the more modern recording in books

i and libraries. Such a study can be followed advantageously

i by more modern analysis of trends of life showing gradual

i elimination of species. The humane viewpoint is much en—

hanced when the depletion of creature life motivates resent-

ment. Such is the virtue of visualizing the destructive after-

math of SELFISH KILLING OR RECKLESS SPORTSMAN-

SHIP. We note with serious concern the creatures in modern

3 times that have completely disappeared, and others whose

i disappearance is threatened. A student can make an interest-
ing report to the class on such assignments as

The disappearance of the heath hen

The passenger pigeon

The threat of extinction of the bison, beaver, egret, bald
eagle and wild turkey (others may be added)

b. Hunting (urban and rural)
1. Regulating laws and license requirements

2. The need of restrictions on licenses covering education,
identiﬁcation, skill in using weapons, etc.

3. Guidance concerning true sportsmanship versus the
depravity of the killer

4. A study of man’s interference with the balance of na-
ture and its relationship to licensed hunting versus

promiscuous killing

c. Fishing (urban and rural). Approach subject with appeal to humane
concern and conservation

1. Industrial

2. Destructive practices

3. Interference with migratory habits
Construction of dams .
Hampering salmon spawning

[4]

 




 

Eels cut off from many of their small stream
habitats

4. Game ﬁsh, breeding and stocking
5. Open season and other game laws

(I. Trapping
1. Steel trap cruelties
2 Steel trap regulations, Pennsylvania law
8. More humane leg—gripping traps and their merits.
4

Guillotine or killer traps; possible merit as compared
with ordinary steel traps

5. Deadfall trap -— pros and cons
The snare

6. Large or heavy traps for bear-like creatures and
legal limitation of the same; their danger for humans

7. Live traps, mostly box trap varieties
Freezing and other distress in box traps

8. Waste, ofttimes involving faulty catch in greater num—
bers than the number sought

Note: Trapping is rarely kind or humane, but sometimes it is
necessary. It is recognized as the outstanding cruelty in the
economic relationship between animal and man.

e. Predatory Animals

Some of the predatory creatures have value as fur bearers,
for food or for other possible assets, but are known as preda-
tory because they are destructive of other life of possible value.
Economically a predatory animal is a creature which destroys
more than it saves in human economy.

These creatures give us another slant on a higher level of
appreciation. Although they are destructive, they often func-
tion very effectively in that intricate law known as THE
BALANCE OF NATURE. They may not threaten extinction,
but instead may destroy the weakling of the species, thus
strengthening the race. Some predatory animals, such as

species of owls and hawks, are considered today of economic
value.

The teacher and the class may select for unit activity
certain creatures with habitat in the community, or some assets
or problems related to local animal life.

Foxes , Owls
Snakes Ferrets
Hawks

the public schools of Pennsylvania. (Section 1514, Pennsyl—

Founded to teach youngsters about wild animals, the
California Junior Museum at Sacramento operates an ani-
mal library, lets children take animals home as pets.

Teachers in the area often bring classes to the
museum although lending facilities are available
only to the children enrolled in museum’s own classes.

Part of training children receive at the museum has
to do with lessons on how to handle various animals.

and ﬁtting it over the ﬁreplace and-
irons. If you do not have an outdoor
grate, take one from thekitchen oven
and place it in the ﬁreplace. A sim-
ple, attractive charcoal container can
be made from an old nail keg. Sand
and paint the outside, attach a re-
movable cover and you are all set.

Secret of successful ﬁreplace cook;
ing is the same as for outdoor grills—
a good bed of coals, smoldering, but
not too hot.

When the steaks are ﬁrst placed
over the ﬁre, they will drip grease
and the smoldering coals will flare
up. For this reason it is advisable to
start out with the steaks at the side
of the grate to prevent charrinO‘.

After a few minutes the grease will
drip in smaller quantities and the
steaks can then be moved to a posi-
tion directly over the hot coals.

For a more informal affair, pre-
pare franks and have buns toasting
in aluminum foil on the grill. Bring
a low table up close and let guests
serve themselves from a bowl of
potato chips, an array of crisp vege—
table relishes and a variety of top-
pings for the franks served in hot
buns. Provide plenty of paper nap-
kins for the ﬁnger food meal and top
it off with generous wedges of choco-
late cake and lots of hot coffee.

It’s good eating, good entertaining
and good fun.

 

Suggested M emt .

Broiled Steak
Tossed green salad
Hot rolls
Ice cream pie

Escalloped Potatoes
Buttered broccoli
Butter or Margarine

Fruit topping

 

Cutting the fat covering of each steak
before placing it on the ﬁreplace grill
will prevent the meat edges from curling.

A casserole of escalloped potatoes can
be placed in oven before starting st ‘aks,
leaving hostess free to entertain guests.

Charcoal spread over paper makes per-
fect bed of coals. Watch steaks carefully
as dripping grease produces high ﬂames.

Hostess tosses a salad while steaks are
being broiled. Entertainment is no prob-
lem as guests enjoy seeing meal prepared.

A fireplace, wire grill from oven or outdoor grate and charcoal are all that’s needed
to use outdoor cooking methods indoors for informal entertaining during winter months.

HEN they found Corky clinging to the
clothing of Mrs. Elizabeth Ray, the other
day, the little Boston bulldog had a fore-
paw around a sapling on the bank of the swollen
creek. outside Chattanooga, Tenn, and was fight—
ing the current to keep his 77-year-old mistress
and himself from being dragged downstream.

Mrs. Ray was dead. Corky had struggled
four hours. to save her.

There are thousands of similar stories in the
files of the American Humane Association, which
sponsors Be Kind to Animals Week beginning
tomorrow, April 7.

The Association awards medals to dog heroes
like Corky to call attention to the gratitude man
owes them. More than that, it seeks to remind
the public of the unique relationship of dog to
man—a relationship the dog never forgets, that
man too often ignores.

It has become a truism to say that the dog
is man's best friend. He is man’s Only friend.

This “anomaly in nature” has been discussed
by America’s beloved author, the late Booth Tark-
ington. In a letter which helped Indianapolis,
Ind., establish a retail pet shop to replace the gas
chamber in handling stray dogs, he wrote:

“I think it was that great man, Maurice Mae-
terlinck, who first. . .said that out of all the hun-
dreds of thousands of species of animals created
by nature, only one—one single species of animals
——had come to be man’s friend and loved him.

“Man made use of other animals, horses and
cattle and other beasts, but out of the myriads
of creatures upon the earth, only one, the dog,
abandoned his own kind and voluntarily crossed
the great abyss that separates the species. . . .

“In the whole of illimitable space man has
no other; (friend): No other loves him, believes
in him or unquestioningly puts the power of
life and death for himself in man’s hands. I
find few things in life more touching than the
fact the dog does this gladly and meekly. Th
history of his “ace has left him no option ex opt
to put his fate in the hands of man, his dearly
beloved god.”

“No option”——it probably never occurs to a dog
to save his own life at the expense of his master’s.

Smoky Could Have Escaped to
Safety Through a Shattered Win-
dow—Instead. He Saved His
Master's Lite by Dragging Him.
Already Unconscious, to the Shore.

  
   

      

There was Smoky, the setter, of Atlanta, Ga.
Smoky was riding with T. J. Donaldson, his mas-
ter, and Benjamin W. Noyes, when the car
plunged into a flooding stream. Smoky could
have escaped through a shattered window.

Instead he saved Donaldson’s life by dragging
him, already unconscious, to the shore. Noyes
was pinned behind the steering wheel and
drowned. Smoky was awarded the Gold Medal
by the American Humane Association.

Brownie, a water spaniel out in Oconomowoc,
Wis., went to his death with his master, Clarence
Cook, rather than desert him. When Cook broke
through the ice of a lake, his wife and daughter
tied a rope to Brownie, who ran with it to Cook.
Brownie could have- returned to shore—instead
he stood by until Cook had almost pulled himself
back to solid ice. Then the rope broke, and man
and dog disappeared under water

It doesn’t take fine breeding, nor even long
association with the individual, to call up a dog’s
devotion to his “dearly beloved god.” Skippy,
out at Williams Bay, Wis, was just an ordinary
black mongrel, yet it was Skippy who dragged
the Kenneth Kruegers’ three-year-old Terry from
the icy waters of Lake Geneva. It was Skippy
who led a frantic father two” blocks to the lake
shore, where Terry lay unconscious.

Skippy had been a member of the Krueger
household for only three weeks.

At the height of the disastrous La Salle Hotel
fire in Chicago last summer, onlookers saw a
German Shepherd dog carefully leading a blind
woman 11 stories down a fire escape to safety.

The dog was Fawn, Seeing Eye dog of Miss
Anita Blair, ELPaso, Texas. Fawn was awarded
the Association’s Gold Medal.

mals have won its awards for saving human lives.

Rewarding animal heroism, is not, of course,
t .e Association’s main function. Preventing
cruelty, thoughtless or intentional, and guarding
against abuses in handling animals comprise its
other work. .

It is always on the alert for any thoughtless
or inadvertent cruelty to animals in mov1es.
One of its directors has been assigned to read
all scripts in which animals appear, and fre-
quently scenes are altered espeCIally to meet
humane requirements.

It has drawn up a code of rules for rodeo
performers to which most rodeo officials agree
in advance.

Through the Association’s efforts, most stage
magicians use stuffed animals in their acts, 1n-
stead of live rabbits, pigeons and chicks.

It has made suggestions, with which most
manufacturers now comply, to improve the ship-
ping crates and boxes in which dogs and cats
must travel.

Recently, a great many thoroughbred racers
have been destroyed by fires at racetracks
throughout the country.

The American Humane Association also has
made recommendations to affiliated organizations
so that they may take action to eliminate fire
hazards in stables.

Two “sports,” outlawed in most states but
still flourishing clandestinely in some communi-
ties, are dog fighting and cock fighting. Wher-
ever possible, the various humane societies assist
the authorities in stopping them.

Whenever man uses animals as servants, he
23' .mes a debt of responsibility and gratitude to
them. When they are his friends, he owes con-
sideration. To all animals he owes, at least,
what we like to call common decency,

The purpose of Be Kind to Animals Week» is
to remind man of that.

I am.doing some research for a series of TV films on the
story subject of dog heroes and it occurred t0 me that no doubt your
library should have sdme Bert of a bibliography on dog backs and
perhaps also knowledge of any film footage on dogs of action, dogs
in training, etc.

Any and all such material would be greatly appreciated by
this writer and the producer, Boris Petroff.

Thank you and good success to you and staff'with each

succeeding day.

Mrs. Christine Stevens

Humane Society of Washtenaw County
R. F. D.

Ann Arbor, Michigan

Dear Mrs . Stevens:

I am glad that you liked the leaflet ”Power of Kindness, " and
according to your instructions we are sending 300 c0pies to Ann Arbor, which
you should receive in due time.

It was very good of you to ask me to pay a visit to the Animal Wel—
fare Institute in New York, and which I shall be glad to avail myself of at the next
Opportunity. I think you know that I have always had the highest regard for
your ability and sincerity and deep interest in the problems relating to children
and animals. All of us are indebted to you in so many ways for what you have
done and are doing to make the lot of animal life a happier one.

May you and your family have a happy time at Christmas and the
holidays ahead.

With all good wishes, I am,

UPPOSE an enormous lion suddenly appeared right
S in front of you, what would you do?

Well, there probably wouldn’t be much you c__ould

do, except sit tight and hope that he was a good kind— lion.

And that’s pretty well what all smaller creatures have
to do when yo_u suddenly appear in front of them —— they all
just hope that you are a good kind lion too.

Birds with nests, frogs and toads, butterﬂies and cater-
pillars and even the pollywogs in the pond—when you’re about,
they’re all one large hope that you’re going to be a good kind
lion.

And so this is just to ask you — will you please always
b_e_ a good kind lion? Will you please always remember how
you’d feel yourself, and try to see the other one’s point of
view (especially when he, or it, is smaller and more defenseless
than you are)?

Will you please be a good kind lion to caged birds,
and caged rats and mice, and rabbits in hutches, that
have to depend on you for everything—and, in fact, all
pets that share your home: will you be a good kind
lion to them, and keep them from pain and distress,
and always remember to see they have fresh food and water?

Will you please always remember that cats, like dogs,
ga__n’t be left to ﬁnd their own food? (They don’t ﬁll rats,
and they can’t live on mice, and they don’t work better when
they’re hungry, any more than you do.)

 

 

Most important, if you go away from home, will you
please remember that your cats can’t fend for themselves till
you get back —— and that it’s very, very cruel to expect them
to try?

 




Then, will you please be a specially good kind lion to
frogs and toads, who are so very defenseless, and just as
easily hurt as you are?

And will you be a good kind lion to butterﬂies and all
insects — and don’t catch them just because they’re so pretty
or so ugly or so easily caught?

Finally, if you catch pollywogs or minnows will you
please be a good kind lion and don’t leave them in a jam
jar? Keep them in a large basin, and give them plenty of
green water-weed, or they’ll just slowly and miserably die
of suffocation. And please never take home live ﬁsh caught
in a running stream, because they would die anyway, whatever
you did.

* * *

Well, those are just a few of the things that a good kind
lion can do —— you’ll ﬁnd plenty more for yourself, for there
are always lots of comparatively defenseless creatures about,
and they all have a great deal to cope with. And so, when-
ever you meet them, and have the choice of whether to help
or hurt, always remember how you’d feel yourself

and
do
please
be

a
GOOD

KIND
LION

HUMANE EDUCATION

Humane Education Com-a
mittee of N. J.. Inc.

. Feb. 25, 1957,.

’ '; To the Editor:

X-

Please tell your readers that“

‘the Humane Education commit-
tee of N. J ., a statewide chartered

organization, is supporting a bill‘
sponsored by Assemblyman Fred~ .

erick H. Hauser, which provides
for the teaching of_humane edu-
cation in schools. T6“"“b‘e‘ Sure,
many teachers have always incul-
cated such ideas, but it was

thought wise to have this law on .

[the statute books, thus allying
New Jersey with ‘many other
states having the same law. Chil-
‘ drentthese days are presented so;
much cruelty in so many’ways}.
that we hope making this law a;

part of their education may offset? ‘

the really horrible things pre
sented to their immature minds. é
. Please request your readers to;
'Write their Assemblyman and Sen;
Richard R. Stout to vote for this

good law. The two assemblymen. ‘
Clifton T. Barkalow and Alfred

N. Beadleston, have always been
most humane. Malcolm Forbes,
who aspires to be governor, is also
a most humane man and very
fond of animals. Dumont tried
two years ago to repeal our bill
- which prohibits the sale of single
chicks. ' ‘

Thank you again. So many of
our members read your paper and;
send us articles. We pass ’emg

alon e. _.

Sincerely,

Christiana Bertram,
, Secretary.

The Humane-Education Bill

Editor Herald-News: We were
so surprised to read your attack
on Assemblyman Hauser’s A»
106, the humane education bill,
as you have always printed our
letters about animals- and have
seemed to be interested. We
cannot but think that the senti~
ments printed were not yours
but those of Commissioner of
Education. Raubinger, who seems
bitterly opposed to character
education such as this bill.

He has never seen kittens with
their eyes dug out by children,
never saved a halfnstarved cat
from being used. as a football,
never rescued a dog set on fire
after . having gasoline poured
over it, or found a cat trussed
up with baling wire with rub—
oer bands around its neck that
haveIeaten into the flesh.

. It 153 true that the curriculum
is heavy but is it necessary to
teach children to collect and cut
open live frogs to isee their

hearts beat or to half—starve rats
to teach diet? Wouldn’t it be

better to Viteach th’ati'nogsl'aré' '

friends who eat mosquito larvae ‘

' and to use slides and discussions
“on right food? I taught and I

know that kindness and regard
for nature makes better charac—

' ters than indifference to the

mercy which Christ preached.
Do we want our children to
grow up to be adults without a
particle of sympathy and
thought for the defenseless or to
be hardboiled, sophisticated
creatures without a thought for

anything or anybody than

themselVes‘? .

PRAISE FOR CONVICTS

Three cheers for those cour-
ageous convicts who volunteered
for cancer experiments. That’s
the right way to discover a cure
which will never be found by vivi—
section and torture of innocent
animals.

spending the summer with
their parents, are deep in a
special kind of family vaca—
tion life. In Some ._families,
though, the f first impetus to-
Ward stimulating summer ac-
tivity whiCh release from
school provided is running
down a bit.

The once ecstatic pleasure
.Of building sand forts on the
beach has lost some of its
original .luster. , Thertrick of
rowing in a straight line has
been mastered. Most of the
games and puzzles by now
have pieces missing. It’s
time for some fresh activities,
some new interests, easily en-
tered ‘ into but absorbing and
suited for relaxed vacation
life. Even for city dwellers
nothing could meet this need
better, than nature 'i study.

Somewhere along the line
certain of today’s parents and
children seem to have picked

up a rather jaundiced view of ~

Nature Study in capital letters.
Skin divers in their' grotesque
regalia, observing in wet prox-
imity the wonders of the deep,
will stir the imagination of
almost any child. Yet won-

ders equally as great as the '
' skin diver studies—and just as

novel to the uninitiated—are
to be found close to home, de-

stranding simple equipment or
. none atau The trick iscap- m
" tunng children’s interest with- '

out beneﬁt of aqualung or

' frogman flippers.
.: It’sbeen our experiencethat ,

the only sure-fire way to in-
terest youngsters in anything
less dramatic than submarine
voyaging or space travel is
to be honestly interested in it
oneself. Life with children in
the summertime offers plenty
of opportunity for adult con-
templation of natural sur-
roundings.

jNTERMINABLE after-
noons at the beach, even a
twenty—minute roadside stop
while the youngsters stretch
their legs, can change charac-
ter completely if one ' puts all
one's senses to work observing
the life that surrounds him.
The sights, the sounds, the
colors, the textures, even the'
different smells of soil, plants
and trees can be almost be-
wildering in their variety.

A delightful

and surprising

true story about two

of the most hilarious pets

a boy ever kept.

PALS
OF MY
, CHILDOH

By FARLEY MOWAT

About the Author

We consider this article one of the most charming
bits of reminiscence that have come our way in a long
time, and we feel certain that readers will share our
joy in it. It is the ﬁrst article written for the Post
by Farley Mowat, 36-year-old Canadian novelist and
short-story writer, but he has appeared in these pages
ﬁve times with his ﬁction. With. his wife and child,
Mowat lives in Palgrave, Ontario, in a cabin he built
with his own hands. —THE EDITORS.

in my youth I had a peculiar afﬁnity for pets of

the more unusual varieties. It was not that I went
out of my wayto ﬁnd them either. They simply fell into
my sphere of life as if dropped upon me by some mali-
cious fate. This, at any rate, was what my parents be-
lieved, and this was how they explained my acquisition
of a brace of rattlesnakes when I was twelve years old.
They recognized the same malignant fate when, later
on, I acquired a full-powered skunk, a mange-afﬂicted
coyote, a parasitic jaeger from the arctic tundra, and a
covey—or bevy—of fourteen hoary bats. When the owls
arrived, my parents were at ﬁrst inclined to believe that
the curse was broken, and they welcomed the new mem-
bers of our household almost with aﬂection, for owls
were, so my parents thought, inactive, digniﬁed and not
very stimulating beasts. My parents were wrong. The
two great horned owls which joined the family in the
spring of 1932, at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, were prob-
ably the most unusual pets I ever had.

In those days I was an avid bird watcher and photog-
rapher, and it happened that in the early spring of the
year I located a great horned owls’ nest in a poplar bluff
not far from the city. The discovery presented me with
an unparalleled opportunity. to secure rare photo-
graphs, and so I constructed a-blind, or hide, in the tops
of some poplars near the nest. The blind was simply a
platform of poles, insecurely tied with binder twine
and covered with a piece of canvas.

The parent owls did not immediately appreciate a
new neighbor, and they impressed me with the weight
of their displeasure by tearing the canvas into ﬁne
shreds one dark night. But in due course of time a truce
was reached. I spent many hours in the blind, and even
managed to obtain a few passable photographs.

Then that strange fate of mine stepped in. Some
youths armed with .22 riﬂes followed me to the nesting
site one day and, after I had left, they murdered the
adult owls. When I returned the following morning I
was greeted by the hungry screams of the two ﬂedglings
which had survived the massacre, and, since I felt my-
self indirectly responsible for their parents’ death, there
was nothing for it but to wrap the owlets in my shirt
and bring them home. I

They were then only six weeks old, but already giving
promise that their ultimate size would be impressive.
My parents, who had never seen a full-grown horned
owl, had no real idea as to just how impressive they
could be, and I preserved a discreet silence on the sub-
ject. Nevertheless, mother vetoed my plan for keeping
the two newest and youngest members of the family in
my bedroom, even though I pointed out to her that the
birds might get lost, and, in any case, they would be
in considerable danger from the local cats and dogs if
they were kept outside.

Mother looked speculatively at the talons which the
unhappy ﬂedglings were ﬂexing ﬁercely—the talons al-
ready three quarters of an inch in length—and gave it
as her considered opinion that the cats and dogs would
have a thin time of it in a mix-up with the owls. As to
their getting lost—my mother was always an optimist.

Eventually my father Solved the housing problem by
helping me build a large chicken-wire enclosure in the
back yard. This enclosure was used only a few months,
for it soon became superﬂuous.

In the ﬁrst place, the owls showed no disposition to
stray from their new home. Each day I would take them
out for a romp on the lawn and, far from attempting to
return to their wild haunts, they betrayed an over-
whelming. anxiety to avoid the uncertainties of freedom
at any cost. Once or twice I accidentally left them alone
in the yard, and they, concluding that they had been
abandoned, staged a (Continued on Page 134)

THE SATURDAY EVENING POST

Pals Of My ChlldhOOd (Continued from Page 36)

determined retreat into the house itself.
Screen doors were no barriers to them,
for the copper mesh melted under the
raking impact of their talons as if it had
been tissue paper. Both owls would then
come bursting through the shattered
screen into the kitchen, breathing hard
and lboking apprehensively over their
shoulders at the wide outer world where
their unwanted freedom lay. Conse-
quently the back-yard cage became not
so much a means of keeping the owls with
us as a means of keeping them from being
too closely with us.

The two ﬂedglings were utterly unlike
in character. Wol, the dominant member
of the pair, was a calmly arrogant extro-
vert who knew that he was the world’s
equal. Weeps, on the other hand, was a
nervous, inconsequential bird of an un-
settled disposition, and plagued by nebu-
lous fears. Weeps was a true neurotic,
and though his brother learned to be
housebroken in a matter of a few weeks,
Weeps never could really be trusted on
the furniture and rugs.

When they were three months old and
nearly full grown—although tufts of baby
down still adhered to their feathers—W01
effectively conﬁrmed mother’s ﬁrst im-
pression as to his ability to defend him-
self. At three months of age he stood
almost two feet high. His wingspread
was in the neighborhood of four feet. His
talons were an inch in length and needle-
sharp, and, combined with his hooked
beak, they gave him a really formidable
armament.

One summer night he was in a huﬂ‘ as a
result of a disagreement he had had with
our dog, Mutt. When darkness fell he

refused to come down from a high perch
in a poplar tree in order to go to bed in
the safe refuge of the cage. Since there
was nothing we could do to persuade
him, we ﬁnally left him in his tree and
went to bed ourselves.

Knowing something of the. ferocity of
the night-stalking cats of Saskatoon, I
was uneasy for him, and I slept lightly,
with one ear cocked. It was just breaking
dawn when I heard the sound of a
muﬂied ﬂurry in the back yard. I leaped
from my bed, grabbed my air riﬂe and
rushed out of the front door.

To my horror, there was no sign of
Wol. The poplar trees were empty. Sus-
pecting the worst, I raced around the
corner of the house, my bare feet slipping
in the dew-wet grass.

W01 was sitting quietly on the back
steps, his body hunched up in an attitude
of somnolent comfort. The scene could
hardly have been more peaceful.

It was not until I came close, and had
begun to remonstrate with him for the
chances he had taken, that I saw the cat.
Wol was sitting on it. His feathers were
ﬂuﬂ'ed out in the manner of sleeping
birds so that only the cat’s head and tail
were visible. Nevertheless I saw enough
to realize that the cat was beyond mor-
tal aid.

Wol protested when I lifted him clear
of his victim. I think he had been enjoy-
ing the warmth of his footrest, for the
cat had been dead only a few moments.
I took it quickly to the foot of the garden
and buried it circumspectly, for I recog-
nized it as the big ginger tom from two
doors down the street. It had long been,
the terror of birds and dogs and fellow
cats throughout our neighborhood. Its
owner was a big man with a loud and
raucous voice who did not like small
boys

The ginger tom was the ﬁrst but not
the last feline to fall into fatal error about
Wol. In time the secret cemetery at the

bottom of the garden became crowded
with the remains of cats that had as-
sumed that Wol was just another kind of
chicken, and therefore easy meat.

Nor were dogs mUch more of a prob-
lem to the owls. Rather grudgingly, for
he was jealous of them, Mutt undertook
to protect them from others of his own
race. Several times he saved Weeps from
a mauling, but Wol did not really need
his protection. One evening a German
shepherd—a cocksure bully if ever there
was one—that lived not far from our

house caught Wol on the ground and,

went for him with murder in his eye. It
was a stirprisingly one-sided battle. Wol
lost a handful of feathers, but the dog
went under the care of a veterinarian
and, for weeks afterward, he would
cross the street to avoid passing too close
to our house—and to Wol.

Despite his formidable ﬁghting abili-
ties, Wol was seldom the aggressor. Those
other beasts which, like man, have de-
veloped the unnatural blood lusts that go
with civilization, would have found Wol’s
restraint rather bafﬂing, for he used his
powerful weapons only to protect him—
self or to ﬁll his belly, and never simply
for the joy of killing. There was no moral
or ethical philosophy behind his restraint;
there was only the indisputable fact that
killing, for its own sake, gave him no
pleasure. Although perhaps if he and his
descendants had lived long enough in
human company, he might have become,
in reality, as sanguinary and as cruel as
we conceive all other carnivores, except
ourselves, to be.

Feeding the owls was not much of a

problem. Weeps ate anything that was
set before him, on the theory, apparently,‘
that each meal was his last. The future
always looked black to him—such was
his sad nature. Wol, on the other hand,
was more demanding. Hard-boiled eggs,
hamburger, cold roast beef and ﬁg cook-
ies were his chosen articles of diet. Occa-
sionally he would deign to tear apart a
gopher that one of the neighborhood
boys had snared on the prairie beyond
the city, but, on the whole, he did not
relish wild game—withone notable ex-
ception.

It has been said, and publicly, by sci-
entists who should know better, that the
skunk has no natural enemies. It is just
this sort of smug generalization that gives
scientists a bad name. Skunks have one
enemy in nature—a voracious and im-
placable enemy—the great horned owl.

There can be few animal feuds as
relentless as the one which has raged
between horned owls and skunks for un-
cOunted aeons. I have no idea how it
started, but I know quite a lot about the
tenacity with which it is still pursued.

The faintest whiff of skunk on a be-
lated evening breeze could transform the
usually calm and benign Wol into a
winged fury. Unfortunately, our house
stood on the banks of the Saskatchewan
River, and there was a belt of underbrush
along the shore which provided an ideal
highway for wandering skunks. Occa-
sionally one of these striped atrocities
would forgo the riverbank and do his
arrogant promenading on the sidewalk
in front of our house.

The ﬁrst time this happened was in the
late summer of Wol’s ﬁrst year. The
skunk, cocksure and smug, as are all the
members of his benighted species, came
down the sidewalk just as dusk was fall-
ing. Some children who were playing
under the poplar trees ﬂed the approach-
ing outcast, as did an elderly woman who
was airing her Pekingese. Swollen with
his own foolish pride, the skunk strutted

on until he came beneath the overhanging
branches in front of the Mowat home.

Our windows were open and we were
just ﬁnishing a late dinner. There was not
much breeze, and by the time the ﬁrst
acrid warning came wafting into the din-
ing mom, Wol was ready to make his
entrance too. He came through the open
window in a shallow dive and fetched up
on the ﬂoor beside my chair, depositing a
defunct skunk upon the carpet at his feet.

“Hoo-hoohoohoo-HOO!” he said
proudly. Which, being translated, prob-
ably meant, “Mind if I join you? I’ve
brought my own lunch.”

We never fully cured him of his ven-
detta against skunks. But it did not
bother us as much as it might have done
some families, for we were already cursed
with. a dog that was a skunkaphobe and,
over the long and pungent years, we had
become resigned, if not accustomed, to
the almost perpetual aura of wood kitty
in and about our home.

Owls are not widely renowned for
their sense of humor, and Wol may have
been an exception, but he, at least,
possessed an almost satanic fondness for
practical jokes, of which poor Mutt was
usually the victim. He would steal Mutt’s
bones and cache them in the crotch of a
tree trunk just far enough above the
ground to be beyond Mutt’s reach. He
would join Mutt at dinner sometimes
and, by dint of sheer bluff, force the
hungry and unhappy dog away from the
dish, and keep him away until ﬁnally the
game palled. Wol never actually ate
Mutt’s food. That would have been be-
neath him.

His favorite joke, though, was the tail
squeeze. During the searing heat of the
summer afternoons Mutt would try to
snooze the blistering hours away in a
little hollow which he had excavated be-
neath the hedge on our front lawn. H ow-
ever, before withdrawing to this sanc-
tuary he would make a careful cast about
the grounds until he had located W0],
and had assUred himself that the owl was
either asleep or at least deep in medita-
tion. Only then would Mutt retire to his
cool repose and dare to close his eyes.

Despite a hundred bitter demonstra-
tions of the truth, Mutt never understood
that Wol seldom if ever slept. Sometimes
the owl’s great yellow orbs would indeed

be hooded, but even then—though he
might appear to be as insensible as a
graven bird—he retained a delicate aware-
ness of all that was happening around
him. His eyesight was so phenomenally
acute as to discredit completely the old
canard that owls are blind in daylight.
Often .1 have seen him start from what
appeared to be a profound trance, if not
a slumber and, half turning his head,
stare full into the blaze of the noonday
sky while crouching down upon his roost
in an attitude of taut belligerence. Fol-
lowing the direction of his intent gaze
with my unaided eyes, I could seldom
ﬁnd anything threatening in the white
sky, but when I brought my ﬁeld glasses
into play they would invariably reveal a
soaring hawk or eagle so high above us
that even through the glasses it seemed
to be no bigger than a mote of dust.

In any event, Mutt’s suspicious recon-
noitering before he gave himself up to
sleep was usually ineffective and, worse
than that, it frequently served to alert
Wol to the fact that his favorite quarry
would soon be vulnerable.

Wol was a bird of immense patience.
He would sometimes wait half an hour
after Mutt had slunk away to rest, before
he began his stalk. He always stalked
Mutt on foot, as if disdaining the advan-
tage given to him by his powers of flight.

Inﬁnitely slowly, and with the grave
solemnity of a mourner at a funeral, he
would inch his way across the lawn. lf
Mutt stirred in his sleep, Wol would
freeze and remain motionless for long
minutes, his gaze ﬁxed and unblinking
on his ultimate objective—Mutt’s long
and silken tail.

Sometimes it took him an hour to
reach his goal. But at last he would arrive
within range, and then, with ponderous
deliberation, he would raise one foot and
poise it—as if fully to savor the delicious
moment—directly over Mutt’s proud
plume. Then, suddenly, the outspread
talons would drop, and clutch

.lnvariably Mutt woke screaming. Leap—
ing frantically to his feet, he would spin
around, intent to punish his tormentor—
and would ﬁnd him not. From the branch
of a poplar tree well above his head
would come a sonorOus and insulting
“Hoo-HOO-hoo-hoo!” which, I suspect

is about as close to laughter as an owl

can come.

It seemed to be inevitable that any
animal which, we took into our family
wOuld Soon cease to consider itself any-
thing less than human, and it was so
with Wol. Very early in lifehe took note
of the fact that we others could not, or
would not, ﬂy, and he thereupon ac-
cepted a terrestrial way of life for which
he was but poorly adapted.

When I Visited the little corner store,
some three blocks from home, Wol would
usually accompany me, and , he would
walk. Strangers who did not know him—

and there were few such mortals in ‘

Saskatoon—were apt to be severely
startled when they encountered him dur-

ing one of these promenades, for he,

walked with a lumbering, rolling gait
that smacked of a lifetime of alcoholism.
Furthermore, he gave ground to no man.
If a pedestrian bound upstream happened
upon Wol going downstream, the pe-
destrian either moved aside or there was
a collision. These collisions were not to
be taken lightly.

I recall all too vividly an occasion
when a new postman, wrapped in the
perusal of the unfamiliar addresses on a
bundle of letters, walked full into Wol
one summer morning. The man was so
completely preoccupied with his own
problems that he did not even bother to
glance down to ascertain the nature of
the obstruction in his path, but blindly
tried to kick it to one side. This, to Wol,
was tantamount to deliberate assault. He
rose on his dignity—which was im-
mense—uttered a piercing hiss and banged
the offending human on the shins with
his mighty wings. Nor was this a gentle
form of retaliation, for the power of
Wol’s wing was roughly equivalent to
that of a medieval battering ram. There
was a sharp crack. The postman yelped
in sudden pain; peered down at his feet;
yelled even louder—this time on a high,
keening note—and promptly ﬂed the
neighborhood. It was left for me to col-
lect the scattered letters and to pursue
him with what I hoped were appropriate
apologies.

VVhen school began again that fall I
experienced some difﬁculty with the owls,
but in particular with Wol. My school
was on the opposite side of the river, a
good three miles from home, and I
reached it by bicycling over the 25th
Street Bridge. When I began going to
classes-in September the owls were indig-
nant, for they, who had been my con-
stant companions all that summer, were
now left alone. They did not readily
accept this new state of affairs and, dur-
ing the ﬁrst week of the term, I was late
on three successive days as a result of
having to conduct my tenacious pair of
avian followers back home.

On the fourth morning I grew des-
perate and tried locking them in the big
outdoor pen—which they had long since
ceased to use. Wol was infuriated by this
treatment and he tore into the chicken-
wire barrier with angry talons. I sneaked
hurriedly away, but before I was halfway
across the bridge a startled shout from a
pedestrian and the scream of brakes from
a passing car alerted me to some unusual
happenstance. I had barely time to apply
my own brakes when there was a wild
rush of air, a deep-throated and victori-
ous “Hoo-HOO!” and two sets of talons
settled themselves securely on my shoul-
der. Wol was breathless from the unac-
customed business of ﬂying, but he was
triumphant.

It was by then too late to take him
home again, so I went resignedly on my
way to school. I left him in the yard,
perched on the handlebars of my bicycle
and insecurely tied with binder twine.

THE SATURDAY EVENING POST

My third class that morning happened
to be French. The teacher was a desiccated
female whose spiritual home may have

' been Paris, but who had never actually

been farther east than Winnipeg. She was
grotesquely affected, humorless and a
tyrant. None of us liked her. Yet I actu-
ally felt sorry for her when, in the midst
of the declination of an irregular verb,
Wol whumped moodily in through the,
second-story window and slid to an un-
satisfactory halt upon the top of her
hardwood desk. The exclamation with
which she greeted him was given in very
old Anglo-Saxon, without even a hint of
a French accent.

I had an interview with the principal
after this incident, but he was a reason-
able man, and the upshot was that I
escaped corporal punishment on the un-
derstanding that my owl would stay at
home in future.

I achieved this end, but only at the
cost of giving the owls the free run of our
house. Some ten minutes before I was
due to leave for school I would invite
Weeps and Wol into the kitchen, where
they were allowed to ﬁnish off the bacon
rinds left from our breakfast. Apparently
Wol accepted this as a sufﬁcient bribe,
for he made no further effort to follow
me to school; and Weeps, who always
accepted Wol’s lead, gave me no more
trouble either. Mother, on the other
hand, was not best pleased by these ar-
rangements.

Although the majority of the human
residents of Saskatoon knew about, and
were inured to, our owls, there were at
least two occasions when Wol and Weeps
were the unwitting cause of some alarm
and despondency to members of the
human species. One of these took place
in a prairie hamlet to the north of
Saskatoon. It was in August, and my
parents had decided that we should spend
a weekend at Emma Lake, a resort area
far to the north. We loaded our camping

gear aboard Eardlie—our Model A con-

vertible—and the six of us—mother,
father, myself, Mutt and the two owls—
set out.

Having ridden in the car on several
previous occasions, the owls had devel-
oped a preference in the matter of seating
arrangements. Their chosen roost was
the back of the rumble seat, where they
were exposed to the full force of the slip-
stream. They loved it, for it offered them
the same exhilarating thrill that all small
boys experience when they thrust a hand
out of a car window and let the wind act
on it as it does upon the wing of an
aircraft. My owls‘exploited this adven-
ture to the utmost limit. As soon as the
car was in motion they would extend
their great pinions as if in ﬂight. If they
then slanted the leading edges down-
ward, the rush of air would immediately
force them into a squatting position. But
when they tipped the leading edges up-
ward they would be lifted clean off the
seat, and only the grip of their talons
would keep them from soaring aloft like
kites.

There was not sufﬁcient room to allow
both of them to bob up and down to-
gether, so they learned to alternate. While
one was going down, the other would be
coming up in rhythmic frequency. In-
toxicated by the rush of air, they would
often break into song and my father,
caught up in the spirit of the thing,
would punctuate their excited hootings
with blasts on Eardlie’s horn.

Mutt also rode in the rumble seat, but
he was too digniﬁed a beast to take part
in these unseemly proceedings. Mutt had
delicate eyes, and in order to protect
them from the inevitable prairie dust, my
father had ﬁtted him with a pair of
motorcycle goggles. Thus the complete
picture of Eardlie on the highways in-
cluded a vignette of Mutt sitting stolidly
between two active owls, and staring
straight ahead through his out-size gog-
gles with a kind of dour resignation.

At the time, I never considered the
effect that this visitation must have had
upon the drivers of farm‘wagons whom
we passed, and upon the drivers of other
cars who passed us. But I have since had
many penitential thoughts about the
matter. (Continued on Page 138)

(Continued from Page 136) On the day
we started north the sky was threaten-
ing, and we had gone only ﬁfty or sixty
miles when a thin drizzle began to beat
upon the wind screen. The drizzle quickly
thickened, and we halted to erect the
canvas hood over the front seat. By the
time we ﬁnished, the rain had become
a downpour, and when we drove off
again the rumble seat and its occu-
pants were receiving a mighty scourging
from the storm. Mutt wisely-hunched
himself down into the seat well, where
he was less exposed to the fury of wind
and water, but the owls refused to aban-
don their exposed perch. They even
seemed to be enjoying the pelting rain,
although their feathers were soon plas-
tered to their bodies and their great
wings were sodden and drooping.

Eardlie was the one that really suffered
from the deluge, and he began to cough
and sputter alarmingly just as we entered
one of those two-elevator, one-store, one-
garage villages which sprout like toad-
stools on the western plains. The garage
in this particular village was a scrofulous
frame shanty with a single antiquated
gasoline pump in front of it. A black
doorway gaped in the facade and, pre-
suming that this led to the workshop,
my father wheeled Eardlie through the
thickening gumbo of the street and
straight into the interior of the building.

The garage was dark and gloomy. A
single meager light bulb glowed dismally
high up amongst the rafters, and by its
wan and pallid rays we could barely
distinguish the clutter of old tractor
parts and rusted scrap that almost ﬁlled
the place. The proprietor was not imme-
diately in evidence, and we were about
to dismount and go searching for him
when my eye was caught by movement
near Eardlie’s rear right fender. A man
was crouching in the shadows there, ap-
parently brooding over an old inner tube.
He had a tire iron in his hand and he
seemed quite oblivious of our presence.

We waited with what patience we
could muster until he ﬁnished commun-
ing with the tube and, very slowly, began
to straighten his back and stand up to
our level. His face came slowly into my
view about three feet away from the
rumble seat. I can see that face as clearly
now as I saw it then. It was pallid, deeply
lined and petulant, and smeared with
grease that had stiffened a week-old
beard. It was wearing a look of querulous
animosity, but this began to change as
the eyes slowly focused themselves on the
car and its passengers. The pallidity of
the face was suddenly accentuated in a
startling manner. The jaws began to
move as they might in a ruminant—
though they were chewing on nothing
more substantial than empty air.

It was then that Wol chose to shake
himself. He spread his wings to their full
extent, gave a little leap and sprayed
water far and wide. The shake trans-
formed him, increasing his apparent size
about threefold as his wet feathers came
unstuck. Even I found the transition
startling enough, but when he concluded
the performance by loudly clacking his
great beak, by flipping the membranes

sickeningly over his yellow eyes, and by,

giving throaty voice to his relief, the
effect was devastating.

The garageman’s face indicated that at
least he found it so. The tempo of his
jaws speeded up and his face registered a
look of fearful and then desperate in-
comprehension.

Perhaps Mutt was as curious as were
the rest of us, for at this moment he
chose to thrust his goggled head over the
edge of the car for a closer look, peering
in his shortsighted manner into the gar-
ageman’s face.

The man had had enough. He moaned
low in his throat, threw the tire iron
recklessly over his shoulder, but did not

. stay to hear the crash of broken glass as

the sole window shattered. He was gone
by then, running down the muddy street,
his lank arms held high above his head
and the rain beating into his face.

“Oh, Jesu!” he was crying. “Oh, Sweet
Jesul I never done it, that I’ll swear!”

Mother was shocked. She felt that this
was a foolish and sacrilegious thing to
say. But how could she know? I have
often speculated since on the nature of
that man’s hidden crime, for there must
have been small enough scope for sin in
that desolate and meager little village.

More than a year elapsed, and Wol
had become a full-ﬂedged member of the
family, before he struck once more at

THE SATURDAY‘EVENING POST

The young man made himself dis-
creetly comfortable on our Chesterﬁeld, a
massive and antique piece of furniture
which was so placed that it faced the
ﬁreplace, while it turned its back on the
open window some six feet behind it.
Balancing a cup gracefully in his hand,
the young divine engaged mother in con-
versation, the burden of which was con-
cerned with my own lamentable absences
from Sunday school.

Wol had been spending that afternoon
ant bathing. This was a peculiar pastime
in which he sometimes engaged, and
which consisted of tearing an anthill
apart and then ﬁufﬁng the mixture of
dust and angry ants through his feathers.
He seemed to ﬁnd the sensation gratify-
ing, although its purpose seemed inscru-
table to us. At any rate, he ﬁnished his

human sanity. He had, by this time, be-
come a house owl, making almost as
much use of the house as we did our-
selves. It was useless to try to deny him
house privileges, for he had learned that
when he came and banged on the win-
dowpanes with his horny beak, we would
hasten to admit him before the glass
gave way. During the warm seasons we
resigned ourselves to leaving one of the
living-room windows permanently open,
and by this portal he would come and go
as the mood was on him.

In the summer of Wol’s second year,
Saskatoon was enriched by the arrival of
a young curate who had just graduated
from a famous divinity school in the
East. The curate was of an earnest per-
suasion and he made it his ﬁrst duty to
pay a call on each and every one of the
members of our parish—to which he was
attached. It was a warm and balmy sum-
mer afternoon when he reached our
house on Crescent Avenue.

He rang our doorbell, and mother was
pleased to welcome him, for he was a
well-favored youth. He had the high-
domed forehead that is so often the mark
of the stage cleric, but the hair above it
was black and curly and in virile contra-
diction to the cloth he wore. Mother
invited him into the living room for a
chat and a cup of tea.

bath about four RM. and, feeling in an
amiable mood, decided to come into the
house and tell mother about it.

To this day, my mother swears she did
not see him in suﬁ‘icient time to warn her
visitor. I believe that she saw him well
enough, but was just too petriﬁed to
open her mouth. It is certain, in any
case, that the curate had no immediate
warning, and it is equally certain that
his superiors had neglected to tell him
about our owls during the brief time he
had been in Saskatoon. It followed, then,
that he must also have been unaware that
Wol, in his maturity, had become a
sentimental bird possessed of the endear-
ing habit of leaping lightly to one’s
shoulder, there to balance himself while
he tenderly nibbled the nearest human
ear with his great beak, breathing harshly
but affectionately into the face of his
companion the while. Everyone who was
acquainted with Wol knew of this habit,
and some deplored it, for Wol was a
carnivore and, as a result, he had the
most atrocious breath.

The ﬂight of an owl is noiseless; there
is no warning rustle of pinions. Wol’s
arrival on the window sill was as silent
as the arrival of a puff of thistledown. He
paused a moment in the opening and
then, spying a pair of tempting shoulders
on the Chesterﬁeld, he forthwith launched

himself across the narrow intervening
space.
The object of his amiable attention

- shot straightway into the air and began

leaping ecstatically about the room. It
was an ill-considered action, for Wol lost
his balance and his talons tightened con-
vulsively.

The curate now demonstrated that he
was both an athletic and a vocal youth.
He howled and his bouncing became even
wilder. Wol, clinging for dear life, and "
deeply disturbed by this rude reception,
tightened his grip once more, and then—
and it happened only because of his sur-
prise and indignation—he forgot for the
ﬁrst and last time in his mature life that he
was housebroken.

I do not recall any single catastrophe
amongst the many which beset my family
through the years, that caused us quite
as much embarrassment as this one.
Mother, who was a pillar of the church,
suffered more than the rest of us, but my
father and I were not exempt. I can but
hope that the church ofﬁcials .duly no-
ticed how well ﬁlled the Mowat collection
envelopes were on succeeding Sundays. I
hope, too, that the elders of the church
had the common decency to reimburse
their new curate for dry-cleaning ex-
penses incurred, let us say, in the line of
duty.

The stories of my family, and of Wol
and Weeps, that I have so far related are
no more than vignettes of a relationship
which, on the whole, was a warm and re-
warding one. Even my mother, who had
less reason than the rest of us for such
an attitude, was singularly fond of W0],
and she forgave him almost everything
during the three years he was with us.
Though our owls were often under foot,
both actually and ﬁguratively, we would
not willingly have eschewed the chance

to live with them.

But as it must be with the tales of most
wild things which have been taken from
the wilderness, the ﬁnal fate of the two
owls was a tragic one. When we left the
West permanently in 1935, it proved im-
possible to take them with us; and so we
reluctantly made arrangements with an
acquaintance Who owned a farm some
200 miles from Saskatoon to care for our
old friends. It was, of course, out of the
question to turn them loose, for they
would have been as helpless in the outer
world as new-born owlets.

For almost a year we had good reports
of both our birds, but then poor, in-
effectual Weeps somehow managed to
strangle himself in the wire netting of his
cage. Only a few weeks later Wol tore
the mesh apart and vanished. I wish that
he had vanished permanently.

Before we left the West I had tagged
both owls with marked and numbered
aluminum bands supplied by the United
States Biological Survey. One day I re-
ceived a letter from the Survey informing
me that a great horned owl, banded by
me in Saskatoon in the spring of the year
1935, had been shot and killed in that
same city in April. of 1939.

The address of the man who killed the
owl, and who returned the band to
Washington, was given. It was the ad-
dress of the house on Crescent Avenue
where we had once lived with Wol and
Weeps.

And so, in the end, Wol went back to
that home which he had known so well.
It took him almost three years to ﬁnd his
way, yet he succeeded. I can guess at his
thoughts as he landed in the familiar old
poplars and then dropped contentedly
down to light upon the window sill, and
to rap imperatively upon the glass with
his great beak. . . .

I only hope that death was mercifully
quick. THE END

Recently Dr. Bingham showed me a communication that he
received from you. I want you to know that I, too, share
his views on the matter. I have seen to it that suitable
rules covering such things have been written into our
State Science Fair rules for exhibitors.

we have many large classes for in-service teachers in
elementary and secondary schools. The Methods of Teaching
Science courses are very large at present. Could you
please send us a bundle of 250 copies of ”First Aid and
Care for Small Animals" and any other materials that you
would like to have distributed to our teachers? ‘We will
be happy to have them.

Sincerely-yours

éert E.

Miss Christine Stevens
President

Dear Miss Stevens:
Thanks so much for your recent letter.

Most certainly the Pillsbury organization does not
knowingly want to add to the problems of organi-
zations such as yours by creating more animal
suffering.

We find, however, that in contests where live
animals are given away, only those persons who want
the animals are likely to participate in the contest.
Therefore, we feel your fear that these animals will
not be cared for is largely without grounds.

Of course, if it is a matter of just anyone getting
an animal on a lottery basis and not particularly
wanting it, then we agree that the animal would be
likely to suffer.

What we are doing in this contest is appealing to
those millions of peOple who do love animals.

Sincerely,

x, .. / . f NA

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you for your interest in our conservation program that
Mrs. Erisman mentioned to you.

At the present time everything is at a standstill because
of the press of other activities.

Our plan is to have interested persons throughout the State
act as lecturers for us in the elementary schools. As soon
as plans become firmed, we will let you know.

We would like very much to have a copy of "First Aid and Care
of Small Animals." We may later be in a position to purchase
some for distribution.

Dear Friend:

'We are sending a note to the Humane Societies throughout the United
States concerning the film, DAVID AND THE PUPPY.

You are probably aware of the continuing pOpularity of the film which
deals with the adventures of a small boy and his dog. The many thousands
of viewers in each State who have seen the film acclaim its educational
value and warmth.

The film was made in c00peration with the Los Angeles chapter of the
American Humane Society and Humane Society personnel was used throughout.

The film serves instructionally by tracing the adventures of a small
boy, David (played by Peter Votrian, one of TV's most pOpular boy stars), as
he accompanies his parents to the Los Angeles Humane Society to choose a
dog from among the strays.

At the shelter the boy is shown as he first picks up the dog in the wrong
manner. He is, of course, corrected by the Humane Officer and the officer
then goes on to instruct the youngster in the prOper method of caring for
his dog. The boy then'takes his dog home, where the instructions he has been
given are put into use.

Some excellent heart—warming scenes of the love of the boy for the
dog and vice versa are shown. Then comes a small tragedy. An Open Spot
in the fence allows the little dog to sneak through and head for adventure.
David awakens in the morning eager to romp, only to discover the dog is
gone. After much searching, the Humane Society is called and then begins
a series of small adventures as the Humane Society ambulance, with its driver,
search for the dog. The dog is finally found and now once again in the back-
yard at the home of the small boy the Humane Officer instructs David further
in the prOper methods of feeding, bathing (dry cleaning) and generally caring
for the dog.

As a public relations film, DAVID AND THE PUPPY has proven its
value to local Societies time and. time again, making a pointed demonstration
of the daily worth of the Society to the community.

/

Preview c0pies of the film are available to Humane Societies.

Dear Sir:

Could you please inform us Whether or not your State has a law
similar to the one reprinted below relating to humane education?

"Sec. 365. In every public school Within this state, a portion of

the time shall be devoted to teaching the pupils thereof kindness and
justice to, and humane treatment and protection of, animals and birds,
and the important part they fulfill in the economy of nature. It shall
be optional with each teacher whether such teaching shall be through
reading, stories, narratives of daily incidents or illustrations taken
from personal experience. This instruction shall be a part of the cur—
riculum of study in all the public schools of the state of Michigan."

Thanking you for your cooperation, I am

FIRST AID TO ANIMALS BADGE \ ~j

To earn this badge, do 10 of these activities including the 2 that have the star.
This badge must be done under the guidance of a vet. It may be done with any kind
of domestic Animal.

*1. Know the types of injuries and diseases to which your animal is susceptible,
and the means of prevention.
All dogs are prone to have accidents which produce cuts, bruises, fractures and
injuries to the eyes as well. Most of these injuries are due to running at large
and may be prevented by always keeping the pet animal on a leash when walking,
or confinement to fenced enclosures while unattended. .
Diseases commonly encountered are distemper, infectious hepatitis, leptospir031s
and rabies. All of the diseases mentioned may be prevented by giving vaccination
. injections at an age prescribed by your Veterinarian. Other diseases commonly
seen are tonsilites, ear infection, prostatetis, bladder infections and kidney
disease.
2. Demonstrate how to approach the animal if it is injured.
Approach an injured animal with caution. Any animal in pain is likely to
inflict painful bite wounds. Talk to the animal in a low tone of voice and
attempt to gain it's confidence by gently stroking the head. If any attempt
is made to bite, a muzzle should be applied.
3. Show how to catch, carry, muzzle, tie, hold or confine your animal when giving
treatment.
Use a gentle and slow approach in catching the animal, and if the pet is gentle
one may pick it up to be treated, without difficulty. If the pet is frightened
a dog lasso may be used.
One may carry a dog by placing the right hand around and under the dog's
chest and letting the right forearm press the dog's body to your side as it is
picked up.
To prevent clawing by cats, the front and hind legs may be grasped while
compressing the animal against the body of the person carrying the animal.

. Explain the first aid treatment for hysteria, bruises, suffocation, burns or scalds,
shock, wounds, or gases, drowning, hemorrhage, fractures, electric shock, internal
injuries. Know the care of new-born animals.

Hysteria

The first aid for hysteria will depend a great deal on the cause for the condition.
The animal should be placed in a quiet, dark, moderately cool place and left
unmolested. After he quiets down a veterinarian should be consulted to diagnose
the cause of this condition.

Bruises

Bruises may be treated by applying hot water at frequent intervals. If
considerable hemorrage and swelling occurs in the bruised area, ice packs can

be applied.

Suffocation

Get the animal into the open air, and apply artificial respiration immediately.

An attempt should be made to examine the throat for presence of foreign objects
such as toys or pieces of bone.

Burns or scalds

If the eyes are burned bathe freely with a saturated solution of boric acid and
then apply several drops of mineral oil. Burns of the skin are best managed by
applying lard, vaseline or olive oil, lavishly. In case of chemical burns, wash
affected parts with water to remove as much of the offending material as possible.

 

 

 




Page 2

Shock

Shock is a symptom of grave and serious complications. As soon as possible

call your veterinarian and provide quiet and warmth to the patient. The Patient
may be placed on a heating pad, and wrapped well in blankets.

Wounds or Gases

Bruises and slight cuts should first be cleaned by bathing with antiseptic
solutions or soap and water. After cleansing the wound, paint with methiolate
or rubbing alcohol. ‘

Deep wounds or extensive lacerations are treated as above, but should be bandaged
after dusting with an antiseptic powder such as boric acid or B.F.I. powder.

In wounds with excessive bleeding the hemorrage must be stopped before applying
a bandage. Digital pressure on a bleeding artery may be applied by placing a
pad of gauze or a clean cloth on the wounds and hold same or bandage. On the
legs a tourniquet may be used for compressing an artery to stop bleeding.

A common means of doing this is to tie a triangular bandage or hankerchief
around the limb above the cut, twist with a stick or pencil and tying the stick,
to hold in place. In any case, pressure on an artery must not be continued for
more than a half hour. To stop venous bleeding (the blood is dark red or almost
black) apply a pad of gauze under pressure. If the bleeding is severe apply

ice packs, and place pressure on the vein below the wound.

Wounds on the ears bleed profusely and are best managed by applying boric acid
powder to a gauze pad and press firmly on the bleeding parts.

Hold the dressing and ear flap against the side of the head by wrapping around
the head.

Separating wounds should be cleansed with warm soapy water after trimming the
hair from the area. Dry with rubbing alcohol and place a bandage over the wound.
If the wound is small it may be left open and painted with methiolate.

First Aid Treatment for gases consist of moving the patient to the open air and
using artificial respiration.

Drowning

The primary requisite is to clear the lungs and establish normal breathing.

This calls for the application of artificial respiration. The most effective
method consists in laying the animal on the right side and emptying the thorax
by means of a number of short, sharp pressure impulses exerted.with palm.of the
hand, over the region of the ribs. Releasing pressure allows fresh air to be
drawn into the lungs. Do not exert too violent an impact nor too deep a pressure
on the chest walls as the internal organs of the chest may be injured. The
mouth should.be held open and the tongue moved back and forth. Artificial
respiratory movements should be continued rythmically at the rate of 15 or 20
cycles per minute. The next step is to provide heat to the body. This may be
accomplished by the aid of heating pads, hot water bottles or hot bricks, and
brisk rubbing of the legs and body in the direction of the heart.

Fractures

In fractures, a temporary dressing may be applied if the part is not too painful.
Shape a piece of cardboard or thin piece of wood for the injured leg by patterning
after the opposite unbroken leg. Two such splints are made and applied over
cotton waddings, one to the inside and one to the outside of the leg. Secure
by wrapping with bandages above and below the break.

If excessive pain is present do not attempt a splint. Let the animal remain
quiet or carry it to the hospital upon an improvised stretcher.

Electric Shock

Electric Shock requires immediate or artificial respiration in open air.
Internal Injuries

Keep the animal as quiet as possible and prevent unnecessary handling.

If symptoms of shock are present, keep the animal as warm as possible, as
described previously.

gare of new-born animals

The dam or mother to he should be washed thoroughly a few days prior to delivery
of new-born animals to prevent bacterial contamination to the young. As the
animals are born they should be thoroughly dried and placed in clean bedding.
The umbilical cords should be clipped off 2 or 3 inches from the abdomen if the
mother does not remove the cord, and methiolate should be doubed onto the end
of the cord.

All pups should be examined for congenital abnormalities, such as cleft palate
or hair lip, and all the abnormal should be humanely disposed of. The young
should be observed as they nurse, in order to determine if they are receiving
proper nourishment from the mother. There are times when the dam will not have
sufficient milk to nurse her young. In this case a formula can be made to feed
the young as prescribed.by your Veterinarian.

5. Demonstrate how to take it‘s pulse and temperature.
The pulse is the recorded number of times the heart beats a minute. In the dog
and cat.this may be obtained by placing the index and middle fingers on the in-
side middle of the thigh at a line where the lower abdominal wall touches the
thigh. On the horse the pulse may be taken on the inside of the lower jaw at
its lowest point. This point lies almost directly under the eye.
The temperature of animals is recorded rectally. The thermometer may be lubri~
cated with petrolatum and inserted three—fourths of it's length. Three minutes
time is sufficient to record an accurate reading.

6. Know how to administer medicine in liquid or tablet form.
liquid. Medicines may be administered with a teaspoon by grasping the skin at
the corner of the animal's mouth to form.a pouch into which the medicine may be
poured. The head should.be held slightly elevated.
Tablet form. Tablets may be given by grasping the animal over the muzzle with
the left hand, and forcing the tablets down the throat with the thumb and fore—
finger of the right hand after opening the mouth.

7. Make and know how to use a dog lasso.
A dog lasso may be made from a h or 6 foot length of sash cord or clothes line.
A loop is placed in one end of the cord and the end threaded through same to
form a loop.

8. Be able to name the parts of your animal.

9. Find out what is being done in your community for the control of communicable
diseases of animals.

There is a city and county ordinance against letting dogs run at large. If this
law could.be properly enforced much of the communicable diseases among animals
would be licked. It is only through contact with other dogs, and discharges of
dogs that a contageous disease is spread.
Then too, all animals can be vaccinated against the more common and serious
diseases affecting them. This is a voluntary basis and is up to the dog owner
alone. Some localities have a compulsory rabies vaccination program. However,
Toledo and Lucas County does not.

10. Know the work and.some publications of the American Humane Association, and
find out the location of the nearest unit of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to animals.

The American Humane Association is a national organization devoted to humane
education and the instigation of legislation to protect animals and children.
The A.H.A. has available to the public leaflets and booklets on animal care,
First Aid, etc. This organization is located at 896 Pennsylvania Street,
Denver 3, Colorado. One of the projects of the A.H.A. is the supervision

of animals used in movies and television to determine that there is no
cruelty involved.

The Toledo Humane Society is a branch of this organization, and is located at
611 South 11th Street where stray dogs are cared for and are either sold or
disposed of.

There is no local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, but
cruelties should be reported to the Toledo Humane Society.

The publications of the American Humane Association include the magazine,
published bi-monthly, named the National Humane Review.

This organization also published a monthly News Letter with news of it's
activities.

Information, leaflets, etc. can be obtained at the local HUmane Society.

11. Know the local and state laws governing the treatment, use, and ownership of
your animal.

All dogs three months of age and over must have a yearly license. This can

be obtained from January let. to 20th. at the County Auditor‘s office in the
Lucas County Court House.

No person shall over drive, work, overload or torture an animal; deprive one of
necessary food or unnecessarily or cruelly beat, needlessly mutilate or

cruelly confine or impound without supplying it during confinement with a
sufficient amount of food and water. No person shall carry or convey an animal
in a cruel or inhumane manner.

It is unlawful to place poison on your own property or property of others

where an animal may get to it.

There is no state law regarding leashing. The law does state that no animal
may run at large, and that includes dogs.

It is unlawful to abandon any animal in the State of Ohio. The penalty for
same is not less than $10.00 nor more than $100.00.

12. List the address and telephone number of a veterinarian and the nearest
S.P.C.A. or Humane Society Shelter.

The address and telephone numbers of all Toledo Veterinarians are listed in
the yellow pages of your telephone directory.
The address of the Toledo Humane Society is 611 South llth Street. The phone
number is Ch 3-1753.
. Give a talk to some group on the value of learning first aid to animals.
Must be done by the individual.
. Know the accepted, humane method of disposing of animals when this becomes
necessary.
The accepted and humane method of disposing of animals may be accomplished by
taking the animal to your Veterinarian. The Humane Society may also be called.
In either case the animal will be disposed of in a rapid, painless and humane
manner.

For The Toledo Girl Scout Council
CAT AND DOG BADGE
To do this badge, do 10 of these activities including the 5 that have a star.

*1. Be responsible for the care of a dog or cat for at least 3 months. Keep a chart
with the following headings: kinds of food; exercise; coat care; illnesses or
accidents; good manners learned; approximate cost of caring for dog or cat a week.
Must be accomplished.by the person earning the badge.

. Be able to identify 5 different breeds of dogs or 3 different breeds of cats.
Suggested breeds of dogs to learn are the beagle, boxer, cocker spaniel, collie
and chihuahua because they are the mast popular breeds of today.

Suggested breeds of cats are angora, persion and Siamese.
There are books obtainable at the Public Library and it's branches covering the
above animals.

. Know the humane and sensible way to housebreak a dog or cat.

The humane way to housebreak a dog requires a lot of patience on the owners
part, but persistance will pay off. All puppies have frequent wetting and
bowel movements. Eating and drinking has a tendency to start the reflex in
action, and for this reason one should take the pet out immediately after eating
and drinking. The animal should also be taken out every 1% to 2 hours between
meals. If the weather is too bad, the young animal can be trained to go on
newspapers, as described above. If the animal is seen to have an accident, a
mild scolding and immediate action in placing it on paper and taking it outside
may prove helpful. Young animals learn by constant repetition and persistance
and diligence on the owners part is all that is needed. The pet stores have a
product that may be placed on paper which attracts the young dog to use the
paper.
The young kitten may be trained as above but a shallow pan filled with sand or
a product called kitty—litter (obtainable at pet supply stores) will best answer
the purpose, and can be used in place of the paper.

Read at least 2 books and see 2 movies in which the dog or cat is the major

character.
Must be accomplished by the person earning the badge.

. Know how to put a safety muzzle on a dog.

A safety muzzle may be placed on the degﬁby taking a stout tape or cord about
a yard long, forming a loop in it's center and applying around the muzzle of the
dog with the knot coming under the chin. Draw tightly enough to hold the jaws
together. Then carry the free end directly to a point just behind the ears,
and tie securely.

Know what First Aid to use in at least 3 of these accidents until a vet can

get there: broken leg; chill; burns or scalds; thorn or glass imbedded in foot

pad; severe bleeding; cuts and bruises.
Broken Leg.
Shape a piece of cardboard or thin wood for the injured leg by patterning after
the opposite unbroken leg. Two such splints are made and applied over cotton
waddings, one on the inside and one on the outside of the leg. Secure by
wrapping with bandages above and below the break. If excessive pain is present
do not attempt a splint. Let the animal remain quiet or carry it to the hospi-
tal upon an improvised stretcher.

Chill
Wrap the animal in any blanket and place hot water bottle in the box in which

the animal is placed. The animal may be placed in a warm air register and.warm
milk may be given if the animal will drink it.

 

 




Page 2 Cat and Dog Badge

Burns and Scalds
If the eyes are burned bathe freely with a saturated solution of boric acid,
and then apply several drops of mineral oil. Burns of the skin are best
managed by applying lard, vaseline or olive oil lavishly. In case of chemical
burns, wash affected parts with water to remove as much of the offending
material as possible.
Thorn or glass imbedded in foot pad
This type of injury is very painful and it is suggested a muzzle first be app~
lied to the dog, and if in the case of a cat, completely wrap the animal in a
blanket with just the involved foot free from the covering. Eye brow tweezers
or sometimes a large needle will be of benefit in prying the offending foreign
object loose. If the Object cannot be removed, a Veterinarian may be consulted.
After removing the object, methiolate or alcohol can be used to cleanse the
area, and the foot should be bandaged in the case of deep, penetrating wounds.
Severe Bleeding
In wounds with excessive bleeding the hemorrhage must be stopped before apply—
ing a bandage. Digital pressure on a bleeding artery may be applied by placing
a pad of gauze or a clean cloth on the wound, and held. On the legs a tourni~
quet may be used for compressing an artery to stop bleeding. A common means of
doing this is to tie a triangular bandage or handkerchief around the limb above
the cut, twist with a stick or pencil, and tying the stick or pencil to hold it
in place. In any case, pressure on an artery must not be continued for more
than one-half hour. To stop venous bleeding (the blood is dark red or almost
black), apply a pad of gauze under pressure. If the bleeding is severe apply
ice packs, and place pressure on the vein below the wound.
Wounds on the ears bleed profusely and are best managed by applying boric acid
powder to a gauze pad and press firmly on the bleeding parts. Hold the dress-
ing and ear flap against the side of the head by wrapping around the head.
Separating wounds should be cleansed with warm, soapy water after trimming the
hair from the area. Dry with rubbing alcohol, and place a bandage over the
wound.
Cuts and bruises.
If the cut is small it should be left open and painted with methiolate.
Bruises and slight cuts should first be cleansed with antiseptic solution, or
soap and water. After cleansing the wound, paint with methiolate or rubbing
alcohol.
Bruises may be treated by applying hot water at frequent intervals. If
considerable hemorrhage and swelling occurs in the bruised area, ice packs can
be applied.

*7. Know how to give liquid medicine or a tablet.
Liquid. Medicines may be administered with a teaspoon by grasping the skin at
the corner of the animals mouth to form a pouch into which the medicine may be
poured. The head should be slightly elevated.
Tablet.Tablets may be given by grasping the animal over the muzzle with the
left hand, and forcing the tablet down the throat with the thumb and forefinger
of the right hand after opening the mouth.

8. Know how to bathe a dog, and how often.
The dog should be given a bath whenever the coat is in a condition requiring
cleansing. If the dog is allowed to stay indoors at all times, it should not
require a bath more than once every two weeks. If the dog is out-of~doors and
is a breed that is used for hunting, bathing should be infrequent and only when
the coat is extremely dirty. The natural oils in the coat help to keep the
animal dry in inclement weather and removal of the oils would be detrimental.
A large tub or receptical partially filled with warm water may contain all or
part of the animal while bathing. Soaps free of alkilies are to be recommend-
ed. Ivory soap is good for bathing a dog. A few drops of mineral oil in each
eye and a wad of cotton in each ear will prevent irritation to these parts be-
fore using the soap. After the animal is scrubbed well with soapy water, it
should be rinsed with warm.water until all traces of soap are gone in the rinse

water. Toweling or a clean cloth can be used to dry the coat as well as
possible. Keep the animal warm until the coat is completely dry.

9- Explain how you would teach a dog the following: walk to heel; stop; lie down;
sit; stay. Or explain how you would teach a cat to keep off the furniture and
not claw things.

Instructions on teaching a dog to walk, to heel, stop, lie down sit and stay
may be obtained at the Public Library and it's branches.

Cats as a general rule need claws left on as a means of defending themselves
should an emergency arias. In the process of keeping the claws sharp it seems
that anything they come in contact with will eventually become scratched up
by the claws. A piece of log may be wrapped in burlap and catnip can be
placed under the burlap to attract the animal to the scratching post. In the
attempt to reach the catnip, the feline will usually claw the log and burlap
and.will return to this post each time instead of using rugs and furniture

for this purpose.

*lO. Find out your state and county laws and.municipal ordinances governing the owner-
ship of dogs and cats in at least 3 of the following: licensing, humane treat-
ment, leashing, curbing, loss or theft, desertion, poisoning, strays.

Licensing. All dogs three months of age and over must have a yearly license.
This can be obtained from.January l to 20th at the County Auditor's Office in
the Lucas County Court House.

Humane Treatment. No person shall over-drive, work, overload or torture an
animal; deprive one of necessary food or unnecessarly or cruelly beat, need-
lessly mutilate or cruelly confine or impound without supplying it during
confinement with a sufficient amount of food and water. No person shall carry
or convey an animal in a cruel or inhumane manner.

Leashing. There is no state law regarding leashing. The law does state that
no animal may run at large, and that includes dogs.

Curbing. According to mr. Steusloff of the Toledo Humane Society, curbing

is the act of taking a dog along the curb on a leash for the purpose of having
the animal eliminate. There is no law prohibiting this.

Loss or Theft. It is against the law to steal an animal. The fine is not less
than $50.00 or more than $500.00 and not less than 10 or more than 30 days
imprisonment. Inquire for a lost dog at the Toledo Humane Society or the
Toledo Animal Shelter. An add can be placed in the newspaper.

Desertion. It is unlawful to abandon an animal in the State of Ohio. The
penalty for this act is not less than $10.00 or more than $100.00.

Poisoning. It is unlawful to place pOison on your property or the property of
others where an animal may get it.

Strays. If there is a license tag on the animal, the owner can be identified
by calling the Lucas County Auditor's Office and giving the license number.
Strays without a license can be taken to the Toledo Humane Society Dog Pound
at 610 - llth Street.

ll. Know the work your local Humane society is doing in protecting the dog and cat,
and in assisting owners in the better care of animals. If there is no humane
society in your locality, find out what‘your municipal government 'does in
and W‘.welfare.

There is no local S.P.C.A. in Toledo. Cruelties should be reported to the
Toledo Humane Society where the telephone number is Ch. 3-1753. Leaflets on
the care of animals can be obtained there.

12. Know how the female dogs and cats should be cared for before and after they
produce their young. Know the food care of puppies and kittens.

In the case of the dog, the dam or mother should be washed thoroughly a few
days prior to delivery of new~born animals to prevent bacterial contamination
to the young. As the animals are born they should be thoroughly dried and
placed on clean bedding. The umbilical cords should be clipped off 2 or 3
inches from the abdomen if the mother does not remove the cord. Methiolate
should be dabbed on to the end of the cord. All pups should be examined for
congenital abnormalities, such as cleft palate or hair lip, and all the

 

 

 




Page h Cat and Dog Badge

abnormal should.be humanely disposed of. The young should be observed as
they nurse in order to determine if they are receiving pr0per nourishment
from the mother. There are times when the dam.will not have sufficient milk'
to nurse her young. In this case a formula can be made to feed the young as
perscribed by your Veterinarian. For the food care of puppies write to
The Massachusetts S.P.C.A., 180 Longwood Avenue, Boston, Massachusetts.
This organization has a leaflet for sale entitled SUGGESTIONS FOR FEEDING
GROWING DOGS.
The mother cat should be placed in a clean box with clean bedding as the time
for the birth of kittens approaches. With the material available, the mother
cat may arrange the bedding to her liking. The soiled bedding may be removed
after the kittens arrive, and the newborn kittens may be dried with a towel.
If the mother dog or cat fails to eat or shows signs of depression after
giving birth to the young, she should be checked by a Veterinarian for the
possibility of retained fetal membranes, infections or a retained kitten or
PUPPY.
One should check to see that all young are nursing and the mother has enough
milk to supply her young.
In the event the mother is unable to feed the young, either kittens or
puppies can be given a formula made up of the following:
1 Cup of Water

lCup of carnation or pet milk

Egg Yolk

Tsp. karo syrup

1 Tsp. Lime Water

The kittens and puppies may be given supplemental feeding to initiate
weaning at h weeks. This feeding may consist of scraped beef, milk and
pablum or pre—cooked cereal. This food should.be placed in a shallow pan
for easy access to the puppies and kittens. The first feeding of young
animals may be disappointing due to the fact that the young may have a hard
time picking up the food. One may help the young by using a medicine dropper
or spoon to get the food into the young's mouth.

For information on the Laws of the State of Ohio pertaining to animals
and especially dogs, you.may want to consult the OHIO DOG OWNERS ASSOCIATION

""“""‘~~~--nun-t-n—auncommon—mum-..“unmunﬂQtum'dnva—um‘dmnmununsound—wu-u-ann—unuumwuuu--~—

Probably the best way of teaching about pets is by incidental teaching. When-
ever the children. in class bring up the subject of their own dog or cat, turtle, etca ,
that is the ideal time to discuss pets and their care. Other appropriate times will
occur during the reading of a story which mentions a pet, or when a dog or cat
wanders onto the playground during activity time.

There will be many opportunities when the teacher can bring the class into
a discussion of animals and other times when ideas about pets can be correlated
with other classroom activities. If this method was left as the only way, however,
many teachers would scarcely mention pets.

A unit of study for a short period of time will give the teacher knowledge
and confidence. It should show the teacher how to create pupil interest using a
tested situation. It should also help the teacher to carry on after an initial incidental
classroom experience in order to exploit that incident to its fullest.

A number of things should be kept in mind regarding a lower grade unit
about dogs and cats.

1. Most boys and girls of this age already have a love and interest in
furred animals.

2. Six to eight-year-olds have a short attention Span.

a. Time spent on one subject should be short
b. Variety is necessary.

3. Emphasis should probably be placed on the teaching of attitudes
rather than facts. '

4. Pictures are helpful at this level. Printed matter is not.
In general, a teacher should:
a

1. Not ask a question that she can get a pupil to ask voluntarily.

2. Not answer a question herself until giving pupils the opportunity to
answer.

3. Help pupils get the answer to a question by asking more simple
questions which lead to the answer of the original question.

    
   




LOWER GRADE UNIT ON DOGS AND CATS
1. Show a picture of a dog-«preferably a large picture which the whole
class can see easily. Ask the children to look at it carefully.
A. Ask them what it is.
B. Ask, “What do you think this dog is doing? “ Let some of them
explain what they think is happening in the picture.
C. Ask, ”How many have dogs at home? “

D. Allow some of them to tell of their experiences with their petso

II. Questions that can be asked if the children do not ask them.

How many legs has a dog?
How many ears has a dog? Eyes? etc.
How does a dog's hair help him?
Can dogs hear well? See? Smell?
E. Can dogs run fast? Why?
Show a picture of a boy or girl feeding a dog. Ask?
A. How many feed their dog?
B. What are some of the things a dog needs? (food, water, a place to
keep warm and dry, live)
C. What do dogs eat?

Dear Mrs . Stevens:

I well know that you are a busy person in many fields, and I want you to
take all the time necessary before you return the radio program; I trust it will
prove useful.

Certainly, after more than thirty years in humane work, I shall always
be interested in its progress, and you may be sure that in the years ahead I shall be
more than willing to help in any way I can. My own feeling is that we are just be-
ginning to make use of the Opportunities that are around us to develOp humane
education which is needed in the growth of character and good citizenship in our
young peOple. It takes good teachers to initiate it, and all that calls for more funds,
but I am confident that some day someone will look far enough ahead so that money
will be given for this purpose rather than to take care of only the present suffering
and distress among animals.

I hope that you will keep my name on your mailing list. My home address
is 187 Washington Street, Wellesley Hills 81, Massachusetts. I hOpe that you and

your family are Well and that you are taki nWW enough to get some rest and recrea-
tion that will prepare you to meet the many tasks that lie ahead.

Animal ,‘Lending Libraries9

Are Planned in N. Y. Area

WESTPORT, Conn; Mar. 28.
-—Nature Centers for Young
America, a foundation which

has recently received $300,000
in gifts to promote its work, has
plans for aiding the establish-
ment of nature museums for
youngsters and connected wild
life sanctuaries in industrial
areas of the East.

, Under a different name, the
foundation has been at work
in the South and West for more
than ten years and has super-
vised the founding there of
thirty-three youth museums.
Animal “Libraries”

Live animals will be a feature
of the museums to be estab-
lished in the Ea t. Museums
that want them will have ani-
mal “lending libraries” where
youngsters, with their parents’
permission, can take out do-
mestic rabbits, white rats, ham-
sters, chipmunks and skunks
(deodorized) and keep them
for a week.

According to the foundation,
the libraries must be closely
supervised by professionally
trained experts, all the animals
must be certiﬁed as harmless
by veterinarians and only chil-
dren over seven who have dem-
onstrated a sense of respon-
sibility” will be allowed to bor-
row them.

The American Humane As-
sociation, in itsmagazine “The
National Humane Review,”
' published an article some years
ago which gave its approval
to the animal lending-library

idea if the libraries are super-

vised carefully by professionals
in the ﬁeld of animal care.
rRunjprOperly, the article said,

 

educational.” Run by unqual-
iﬁed people, it warned, they
may do great harm.

A number of lending libraries
in youth museums which the
foundation helped to set up
are operating in various states.
In the New York metropolitan
area there is one youth mu—
seum which was sponsored by
the foundation. It is the Mor-
ris Junior Museum at Morris-
town, N. J. (It doesn’t have a
lending library).

The ﬁrst of the foundation’s
projected museum-sanctuaries
in the East is the $260,000
Mid-Fairﬁeld County Youth
Museum, which has already
passed the half-way mark in
its fund drive. Recently the
Lions Club 'of Westport gave it
$5,000 for a room where blind
children can touch mounted
and live animals. The museum
has been given ten acres of
land in Woodside Lane in
Westport and has an optibn on
thirty more adjacent acres.

The plans for setting up
youth museums and nature
centers were outlined here by
the foundation’s operations di-
rector, John Ripley Forbes, a
protege of the late William T.
Hornaday, the great American
naturalist. Mr. Hornaday once

Information, Advice

The foundation does not op—
erate museums and nature
centers but conﬁnes itself to
giving information and expert
advice to local groups which
are interested in such projects.

-“We hope to set up nature
centers not too far from the
George Washington Bridge on
the New Jersey side and on

the libraries are “beneﬁciallyLong Island net far from New

York City,” said Mr. Forbes at
his home on Big Pines Road
“Youngsters from New ~~ York
City and all around can go
there to look at‘ nature exhibits
and see and touch animals and
maybe even take them home for
a visit.”

Mr. Forbes is an exuberant,
outdoorsy man of forty-ﬁve who
began collecting animals when
he was a Boy Scout in Stam-
ford.

“With live, animals you can

.reach all kinds of kids that are

unreachable in other ways,” he
said. “I remember going into
the Stamford Boys Club one
day with some live animals.
They had a lot of tough kids
and some of them put a couple
of stink bombs in my car. I
showed the boys the live an-
imals and after that there were
no more stink bombs. I remem-
ber another place where a
spastic boy in California had a
baby possum put in his arms.
That kid let- out a yell of joy.
He had nev- . de a sound
before. a ' . -

 

 

he was

able to begin learning how to i
talk. Apparently, some inner ‘-

tension was released by the
animal.”

Mr. Forbes and an associate,
Kenneth Lewis, established
what they believe to ‘ be the
ﬁrst animal lending library in.
the country- in Portland, Bra,
in 1948. The present founder:
tion’s predecessors were the
William T. Hornaday Memorial
Foundation, which was estab-_
lished by Mr. Forbes in 1939.“
In 1951 he changed its name

to the National Foundation for .

change in name took place a

ﬂu or CA5
Siocéing

By DOROTHY BARCLAY

 

OW many puppies, kittens,

hamsters and parakeets will

acquire new masters during
the holiday week ahead is still anybody’s
guess. If the indications of past years
are any guide the number should be im-
pressive.

The average parent isn’t likely to be
so much concerned with America’ s over-
all pet pOpulation, however, as he is with
the clear-cut question of how many pets
~—-if anywbelong in his house. This
question may be an especially burning
one in many families right now as
Christmas comes on and children’s plead-
ing hits a new high. (“I don’t want any
.thing else. Honest! .I won’t expect an-
other thing!”)

Are pets as important as yearning
youngsters try to make them out to be?
Sure, they’re nice; but are they neces—
sary? In some ways, maybe so. Any-
way, children and parents aren’t. the
only ones concerned about the place of
animals in households these days.

Dr. 'Nelson "Foote, a sociologist ’we‘
have often quoted, has cited the dog to

members of the University of Chicago’s :
Committee on Human Development as a _

“family member” worthy of ,more atten-
tion, from social scientists. (Among
Navajos, he points out, the family cat
apparently “drains off all the aggres—
sion which American youngsters expend
in sibling rivalry”) -

DrgJames H,- S. Bossard, of the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, who once wrote
an article on the mental hygiene of own-
ing a dogr—and received over the next
‘five' years 1,033 letters of comment on
his observationsm—is currently collecting
material on the emotional importance of
dogs to invalids and the handicapped.

ON a highly scientific plane, Dr. John
D. Beck, Chief of staff of the Ellin
, Prince Speyer Hospital for Animals and
director of the Margaret M. Caspary
Center for Veterinary Research, is plan-
ning‘a project to investigate some of the
unknown factors in the psychological
relationship between people and animals.
The day may come, he told us recently,
when animals raised under carefully
controlled conditions will actually be
used for emotional therapy with human
beings. ’ -
We can see' Dr. Beck’s point. It’s
plain old folk wisdom that a lonely child
can" deepen ‘and grow through relation-
ship with a loving animal. What irri-
table, stubborn or high-Strung creatures
may do to a household—and the “emo-
tiOnal security” of their masters—has
not, to our knowledge, been explOred.
The kinds of research that Dr. Foote
and Dr, Beck suggest would, of Course,
go far beyond simple household truths.

As we see it, though, if scientific men
are thus alert to the possibility of deep-
er values in pet ownership, perhaps
reluctant parents will be willing to con-
sider them in evalu'ating the, question so
far as their own families are concerned.

Let’s say right now that any parents
who may be considering the purchase
of a pet as a device to teach respon—
sibility to children will do everybody a
favor—particularly the pet—4f they just
forget it. Talking with Dr. Beck we al-
most had the feeling we were interview-
ing the representative of an adoption
agency. Unless the proposed young
master, is a responsible child old enough
to be trusted to take proper and loving
care of an animal, he declared, the whole

family must be in .at least reasonable _

agreement on the wisdom of the project.
If [father or mother is actively resistant,
if sisters or brothers would be jealous,
the results of adding a 'lively animal to
the family—at least for apartment
dwellers—could, be unpleasant if not
downright emotionally diSturbing.

Because a well chosen pet, well

, trained and well cared for, could add .

meaning, pleasure and, quite possibly,
length to many lives, the medical depart-

ment of the Equitable Life Assurance

Society recently produced ,an excellent

little pamphlet to help people- think.

through this question—to own or not to
own an animal.

38 your family willing to give an

animal the time, energy, patience and,

care that are necessary fer adequate
training, good health and essential
grooming? Do the adults of the family
value home possessions so much that
accidents to carpets, hair on the uphol-
stered furniture and chewed or scratched
table legs will cause more irritation than
the pet’s good points can offset? Does
the family travel much '? Who would
take care ofa pet while you are gone ?

Some communities have animal, “lend-

_ faction to family life.

 

 

 

     

ing libraries” vwhich permit families,
through their young, to try out various;

, types of pets before deciding Lacking .

this some parents with a long-range
point of view have purposely worked,“
their way up the scale, 3 starting, with -,
fish and, turtles, ‘which' require a mini-
mum of care; going. on to chameleons,
which are fascinating, hardly lovable
but good elementary training in require-

,ments of supervision; proceeding finally

to hamsters, the liveliest, most delightful
little balls of fur this side of puppies.”
How youngsters respond to pets like
these, how long their interest and will-
ingness as caretakers last, can be first-
rate indications of their readiness to take

on responsibility for a kitten or pup.

j REPUTABLE kennel or pet shop
which can be trusted to supply healthy
animals is the-best source for novices to
rely on. Because, in Dr. Beck's opinion,

. the ‘early experiences of a puppy may

well be as important to his future “per-
sonality” as the early experiences of a
human child, an animal who has had
kindly care—4including human contact-—— ,
from. the start is. the safest choice. Fur-‘

' ‘_ thermore, he feels that dogs, like chil-

dren Amay well take on. some of the
characteristics (and not always the best
‘ones)_of their. .“parents.” Therefore, he
recommends that the quietest, most or-
derly introduction possible into family
life be arranged.

Unquestionably pets who are loved
and wanted can add pleasure and satis-
If there are solid
reasons against their presence in the
household, however, parents should not
allow themselVes to be istamp‘e'ded into
an unwise Purchase.

NeW'York 3, New York

Dear Miss Stevens:
Thank you so much for your letter of January 26.

I regret to advise that I cannot provide vou with copies
of my CONSERVATION CHATS. At the time I published these
little booklets, I sold the whole issue to the State Depart-
ment of Education of our own state. They have been distri-
buted to schools here. I have no supply for distribution
at this time.

I appreciate what you say about the books and am moved
to inquire if vou could sugoest some organization which m1eht
like to sponsor national distribution of them. I believe
that the message they contain for children would do well
to have wide proclamation. However, I don't know the kinds
of people who would be interested in undertaking such a thing.
Perhaps you could suggest someone.

Peabody Museum October 1956

School time is club time, and this year we hope that every boy and
girl in the New Haven schools will become acquainted with the humane
education program that is being carried out in our city. Since these
clubs were started in 1929 by Mr. Allan Loeb, now President of the
Animal Welfare League of New Haven, when he was a pupil in the
Worthington Hooker School, thousands of our citizens have been taught
the valuable message of proper respect for all forms of animal life.
Each year we ask for new members so that the program will spread to all
parts of the city.

 

A printed slogan, "I will protect and be kind to all animals" was.
enclosed with the first bulletin. It is the oath that we hope all
members will not only repeat but carry out every single day. Place
this slogan across the top of a bulletin board reserved for animal news.
It will be one of your duties as a club member to keep that bulletin
board filled with pictures and news items concerning animals. The
animal world is made up of all living things that are not plants, and
you can include birds, insects, fish, reptiles, and amphibians together
'with your favorite animals, cats and dogs that represent the mammal

group.

**e****************e***

We encourage club members to send letters to this office, describ—
ing their school meetings or something that they have done for animals.
Though these letters arrivedtoo late for publication in the June Bulle¢
tin they will give you some valuable ideas for starting out the new yew

Dear Miss Clark,

Bird watching is fun. During the past winter
I fed them bird seed on our terrace, and I was rewarded by
the number of visitors I received.

Now that food is plentiful, they no longer
come. Instead I enjoy the numerous varieties of birds that
are flying about. They are easy to identify with my nine-
power binoculars. To date I have seen robins, thrushes,
nuthatches, scarlet tangers, thrashers, catbirds, orioles,
a red~winged blackbird, house wrens, grosbeaks, mourning
doves, eastern towhees, flickers, goldfinches and swallows.
Each year I see different kinds of birds. Bird watching is
thrilling. Try it!

 

   

Sincerely,
David Wilson

Pupils in Morris Cove School publish a newssheet, School News and
the May 1956 issue had many stories concerning the work done by mem-
bers of the Audubon-Humane Club. This article concerns the Room Four
Audubon~Humane Club.

The children of Room 4 at Morris Cove School have enjoyed
their Audubon-Humane Club very much this year. We have meet—
ings every Tuesday morning. We have a president, a vice-
president and a secretary to help us. Our teacher, Mrs.
Schlosser, helps us to do many interesting things at our
meetings.

Some of the things we have done are in the following list:

1. We have seen film strips on birds.

2. We had a spelling contest on bird's names with

a Bird Stamp Book as prize.

5. We made crossword puzzles on birds.

4. We made posters.

5. Miss Clark visited us and talked to us about birds.
6. We colored pictures of birds.

7. 'We have written stories on birds.

8. We made paper mache birds.

9. We saw a movie called "Yours For a Song“
10. We read many books about birds and animals.
ll. We borrowed slides from the Peabody Museum.
12. Some of us made bird houses and feeding trays.
13. We made a collection of bird's nests.

We are planning to write a play and use our paper mache
birds in a puppet show. Then we will mount the birds in
some sort of a display case so that they can be enjoyed by
the children for a long time.

These birds were displayed in the first floor of Morris
Cove School and a photograph of the exhibit was sent to the
National Audubon Society.

**********************

One of the first duties of club members is to check on dog li-
censes and we suggest that you start with your pet. Does your dog
have a license? After your dog is six months old it must be licen-
sed. A dog license can be obtained from the Town Clerk’s office in
the Hall of Records, 200 Orgnge Street. The license fee is very
little compared to the protection it gives your dog. A male or
spayed female license is $2.10, and the license for a female dog is
$5.35. At the present time a survey is being conducted by the state
and the city concerning proper licensing of dogs.

Don’t let your dog be impounded because of your failure to take
care of its license.

Can you find the magazine section of the New Haven Register for
August 26, 1956?

There is a delightful article in that issue, A Bay with the Dog
Warden. It describes the efficient work of Officer Colwell, and from
it you will learn of his many duties.

October Days

We are very fortunate living in a climate
where we can enjoy a seasonal parade of animal
and plant activities. Spring is the awakening
time and seems to be the busiest Season, as "
plants develop and grow, and all baby animals put
in an appearance. Summer furnishes long warm day;
in which plants grow larger supplying the newly
born animals with plenty of food so necessary for
their growth. Autumn brings an end to the colors
in plants around us, winding up the season with
brilliant crimson and bright orange and yellow.

\n\\ Autumn too is the season for ripening seeds and
\\\ fruits. Everywhere these seeds are being carried
f\B\\QQ§y the wind or animals to new places where they
\ rest for the winter before starting new growth in
~§ spring.

3.

\x.‘ t

In the city harsh sounds from noisy Bluejays
and cackling Starlings have replaced the cheery
songs of the summer birds, and from every thicket
in the woods is heard the quiet twittering of the
migrating Warblers. Insect musicians provide
sounds at night, and cheerful crickets, katydids
and an occasional cicada furnish an evening
orchestra.

This is the time of year to investigate the
many living things around you. Start a science
table where all your special treasures can be
displayed. Arrange a seed collection, putting
all seeds that have the same method of being
scattered together or collect some of the common
nuts and berries. Bird nests can be gathered
and it will be easy to find them after the leaves
have fallen. Bring in insects found in your
garden. Someone is sure to find a few grass“

._‘ hoppers, praying mantids or crickets. If they
“I {QT/'§§§g§£re alive keep them in an insect rearing case.
“35¢:gg:§:§\\;::gg Shells gathered at the beach this summer make
““NM §::j\-a?fascinating exhibit too, and every shell was
"N\\a\hxformerly the home of some seashore animal.
‘“‘\-.

Leaves help in tree identification. A col-
lection of leaves or leaf prints from trees near
your school will prove the many different kinds
of trees planted along city streets for shade and

beauty.

If you enjoy learning more about birds and
other animals plan to become a member of the
Audubon Junior Club. Dues are twenty five cents.
You will receive all the new club material if you
join now.

FROM: Patricia Cavanaugh, Public Information

SUBJECT: Summer job opportunities for women nature enthusiasts and science teachers

Miss Marie Gaudette, nature adviser in our Program Department,suggests that
you may be able to help us with a campaign to recruit nature counselors for the
summer camps operated by 650 Girl Scout councils in all parts of the country.

The attached announcement gives basic information. we hope you can make its
contents known to the women who may be interested in serving as nature counselors

for girls 7 through 17 years old, through publications, bulletins or other chan~
nels.

This is the first time that we have made a direct appeal through nature and
natural~science periodicals and associations, to recruit the growing number of
nature counselors needed in Girl Scout camps. we shall be grateful for your

help, and will welcome an opportunity to purchase two copies of any printed ma~
terial in which this information appears.

For Immediate Release

Thousands of rewarding summer jdbs which can lead to professional advancement
are awaiting nature—study enthusiasts, women science teachers, and college girls and
graduate students interested in the natural sciences. These are the hundreds of nature
consultants' assignments at camps operated by 650 Girl Scout councils throughout the
country, and the thousands of openings there for camp counselors to live and work with
girls in their units.

Many women look forward to their summer jobs at Girl Scout camps as a welcome
change from their year-round activities. They return year after year, to enjoy living
and working with girls 7 through 17 years old in the relaxed and friendly atmosphere

of the out-of~doors. They look forward to opportunities to engage in their hobbies,

to find new interests and new friends, and to enlarge their professional experience.

I

And.the combination of full maintenance plus some salary,wdih life in the out-of—doors,
makes a summer at camp seem almost like a vacation with pay.

The nature consultant's primary responsibility is to counsel fellowbcampers in
the ways of nature. The'camp‘s own setting dictates much of the information to be
imparted to girls and adults alike - seashore and mountains, desert and woodland,
all pose their special questions about flora and fauna, geological and ecological
features, conservation, change or development. The consultants who help youngsters
enlarge their knowledge of the fascinating and ever~changing out-of-doors can be sure
they are encouraging them to develop interests which can lead to life-long hobbies and
even to careers.

Requirements for jobs at Girl Scout summer camps are simple —~ good health,

of course, plus patience, enthusiasm, adaptability and love for children; Knowledge

 




 

 

of camping is helpful. Candidates must be in sympathy with the general objectives
and the philosophy of Girl Scouting. And all Girl Scout workers must be interested
in helping girls of different backgrounds enjoy to the full their Opportunities to
live, work and play together.

To qualify for a nature consultant's assignment, a woman must be at least 21
years of age. She should have the required broad range of specialized knowledge,
based either on formal training in the natural sciences, or on informal personal
interest in and study of nature and the out-of-doors. She also should be accustomed
to working with young people on a basis of informal give-and—take.

Camp counselors should be at least 18, and should have had experience both in
camping and in working with children as a leader, teacher or program.consultant. If
the candidate also is a nature enthusiast, so much the better}

Salaries are determined by the individual’s experience, qualifications and train~
ing. Depending on the length of the camping season and the location of the camp,
such incidentals as laundry and travel expenses may be included. A basic pre~camp
training session of about five days' duration is provided for all staff members.

women interested in Girl Scout camp jobs near home should get in touch with the
nearby Girl Scout council, usually listed under "G" in the phone book. For openings
in other parts of the country, write directly to Miss Fanchon Hamilton, Recruitment

and Referral Adviser, Girl Scouts of the U. S. A., 155 East hhth Street, New York 17,
N. Y.

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you for your letter of September 13th. You asked if the mimeographed
sheets on the care of pets are available for purchase from.our Society. 'You
are certainly welcome to have them copied, but we are not able to prepare
them.in large quantities because our mimeographing is done by various staff
members who have their regular duties as well. 'We do not have anybody to
devote full time to mimeographing.

I am glad you enjoyed the quaint poster, and I wish we could get more of them
( we have just a few ), but they are out of print.

You mentioned plays written by Mr. Walter Elwood~--I have never seen any of
them performed,, but Mr. Pollard sent me a copy of "One Morning Long Ago" which
I think is wonderful, but so far I have been unable to work it into our humane

education program. However I am certain that teachers and children would like
it.

Our best wishes to you.

Sincerely,

Miss Cristine Stevens, President
Animal Welfare Institute

22 East 17th Street

Haw York 3, ﬂew York

Dear Miss Stevens,

Relative to the 3 cepies of "Basic Care of
Experimental Animals" requested, I wish to clarify
these points. First, we are basically a Junior
Museum of Natural History, but one with a small
related zoo. Your manual canbe of great personal
value to us, relative to proper housing, feeding,
etc.. we're always looking for better means of
caring for the animals. Second we do not allow
nor do we encourage any experimentation with
animals. We agree that this is satisfactory only
in colleges and universities. Third, we have
numerous requests from parents teachers, and
students for information on caging, housing and
care of all types of pets. These would serve as
authentic reference material for such persons.

We appreciate the fine work being done by
your organization. we try in our limited way to
assist by acquainting children and adults with the
proper means of caring for all types of animals,
both wild and domestic.

I'm sure we will qualify as a recipient of
this valuable booklet. It will aid our operation
considerably.

Sincerely,

Charles A. Hice Director

av AM “Cruelty to animals is the degrading attitude of paganisvn.”—Cardinal Hinsley

Why a Humane Education Program

IT is almost impossible to go anywhere today
without experiencing the work that is being
done by humane societies; through shelters,
through education in the schools, through legis—
lation, and the distribution of leaflets and publi-
cations. It may be in a little town or a large
city that one ﬁnds activities and efforts in behalf
of humane education, and I must thank God
for it.

We are in a world where we are spending so
much time and such tremendous fortunes on
destructive efforts, and we seem to be caught
in a situation where we find ourselves having to.
The tremendous ' machine-s and technological
advancement involved in these costly move-
ments seem to have no heart, no pulse. Contrast
the aims and purposes of humane education;
which to my way of thinking should be .head-
lines in our newspapers and magazines much
more frequently than they are, for they help
develop in humanity soul and spiritual qualities
that make us fit to carry on.

I am speaking therefore as an educator on the
need for humane education in our schools of
today to a greater extent than it is yet de—
veloped. I shudder to think of the future with—
out it, and I am glad to think of the future
because of it. It ties in perfectly with some of
the newer understandings of what makes chil-
dren tick. Time was when we thought of chil-
dren as being little; able to deal only with little
ideas. Later on when they got bigger they
would deal with bigger ideas. We realize that
notion of children was woefully wrong. The
way they think and act in their childhood years
points the way as to how they will carry on in
the years to come. We are beginning to see
that the normal, healthy child has an insatiable
quest for knowledge, for information. . . .

A second quality of the normal child is that
he is very eager to take hold and become part

of things, to 'be a participator and a manager.
This is an important understanding which once
we thought as nuisance-making we are now be-
ginning to see is the way in which a child learns
to live in his world as a productive, contributing
citizen. He doesn’t want to just sit and watch
it, he wants to 'help it move.

Most important is that we begin to see that
we can guide children so that they become kind,
humane, judicious, understanding persons or
neglect [them so that they become cruel, insensi-
tive, reckless and destructive. . . .

Educators have discovered that much that
was once taught children; reading, writing,
spelling and penmanship was not inclusive
enough of the world about them, particularly in
the natural sciences. . . .

I am shocked, and I know you are too, that
in 1951 one million children in the United
States between the ages of ten to seventeen got
into the hands of the police. Now what hap-
pens to these youngsters? Obviously many of
them are bright, many of them could learn, but
deep into their personalities wholesome interests
are not being developed. But these youngsters
who are interested in animals, asking about ﬁsh,
are beginning to understand the never-ending
fascination of the world about them. And they
will be building into their ways of living whole-
some interests that are terrifically strong in off-
setting inﬂuences that are negative that send
youngsters down the way. . . .

With his arm around a dog a child is never
alone in the world, for the companionship of
pets is a wonderful stand-in when he has to be
alone, if the pets are properly selected. . . .

For some youngsters, learning how to be kind
is just a matter of information. The child who
has the experience on how one helps a pet to
live comfortably, how one helps to understand
a world where relationships are good and de—

for their pets. They move from animal to
human, and from human to animal. They put
us all in one world. All this is making a tremen-
dous contribution to the guidance of children’s
attitudes; attitudes that are positive and COH‘
structive, right for living in a neighborhood, in
a community, in a home. . . .

I don’t think I need to answer with another

summary as to why a humane education pro—
gram is important to our schools. We can see
at this time in our society, in this year of our
Lord, we are inserting into the minds of our
children and into our relationships with» them
and elevating a character—building quality that
will leave an increase for the good as long as
they will live.

Dr. Roma Guns.

Teachers College, Columbia University
in Our Dumb Animals

Editorial Postscript: Though we commend the foregoing article to our readers, we would like to point out a great
evil to which the author does not advert—the increasing infiltration of vivisection propaganda into our schools—in
fact, many children are being initiated into its actual practice, particularly in classes in biology. This ominous
situation is bound to seriously impair the effectiveness of the humane instruction to which attention is called.

 

Is Your Money Subsidizing Cruelty?

Highly publicized drives for research funds are becoming more and more the
order of the day and in the aggregate an immense amount of money is contributed
by the public. Just how much of this is being diverted to subsidizing animal
experimentation or, in the words of George Bernard Shaw, is poured down the
vivisectors’ sinks, is never disclosed, but that it constitutes no inconsiderable por-

tion of the grand total is certain.

When solicited for contributions ascertain if your money is going to support
those who make their livelihood or gain a certain notoriety in “scientific” circles
by the torture of pathetically helpless and uncomprehending animals.

 

Suggested Form of Bequest to Our Society

For the information of those who have it in mind to remember us in their wills but
— like so many who have written as — are uncertain how their desires should be expressed

we suggest the following:

To the New England Anti-Vivisecﬁon Society. 9 Park Street, Boston, Massa-

chusetts, I give and bequeath the sum of...

Caution:

case of wills, to litigation.

Be sure to describe our Society by its correct name in your will — also in your checks and
Post Ofﬁce money orders. Failure to observe this precaution has led in the past to difﬁculties and, in the

HOMES FOR WILDLIFE

Just what is a home anyway? If wildlife could talk, we should

certainly receive many different answers.

To a bighorn sheep, home may be a craggy mountain height.
An antelope is at home on the sagebrush plains. A pair of black
ducks may seek the secret silences of a beaver pond, deep in a
balsam swamp. And a woodchuck likes his living quarters below
ground.

Hollow trees and hedges, old stone walls and burrows all
furnish homes, especially for the smaller of our wild creatures.
Some day you may be able to help keep some of these natural

homes from being molested.

A good home for wildlife, like a good home for man, should
include certain essentials: Refuge from the elements, safety from
enemies, a place to rest, privacy, proper temperature, and nearness
to the essentials for survival, such as food and water. Home should

be a good place to raise a family.

Nature once provided most wildlife homes. But with the
advance of civilization, many of these have disappeared, 881990ially

woodlot and marsh homes. Pollution of waters with sewage and

 




 

 

industrial wastes has destroyed many of the wetland living places

of water birds, ﬁsh and furbearers such as muskrat, mink and

beaver. Uncontrolled ﬁres have also ruined the homes of many

animals in our forests and grassland areas.

You as a conservationist may in some cases help remedy this

situation and give Nature a hand. For many of our wild creatures

seem to like manmade homes as well as those provided by Nature.

Wood ducks, hooded mergansers, squirrels and songbirds may be.

quick to take advantage of your efforts to help provide them-E»

with a home.

for in a wildlife community.

Many of the wildlife homes
you will see can be duplicated at a
workbench. We have included here
some suggestions on these too, and
we’ve listed some publications that

will show you how to build them.

NATURAL WILDLIFE HOMES

NATURAL LAKE OR BEAVER POND: You will ﬁnd many
wildlife homes surrounding such an area.

NATURAL POND: Examine the shores of these little water
areas. You’ll ﬁnd tracks of many of the members of your
local wildlife community.

BEAVER DAMS: Among the most interesting of Nature’s
creatures are these woodland engineers. Their dams help
hold water on the land.

NATURAL WOODS: A woodlot may contain a surprising
variety of wildlife. Make an inventory of wildlife homes on
your next woodland trip.

NATURAL STREAMBANK VEGETATION: Streambank
cover helps keep water clear and cool. It provides shelter for
ﬁsh, too, beneath shaded banks.

NATURAL BRUSH SHELTER: Fallen trees and branches
make homes for many small creatures.

NATURAL FOOD AREA: Berries and other wild fruits pro-
V1de the “meat and potatoes” of many a small creature’s diet.

HOLLOW. TREE: Wood ducks, hooded mergansers, coons,
ﬂ'ylng squlrrels and other creatures compete for such desirable
wﬂdlife quarters.

DUCK N ESTING AREA: A natural stand of vegetation near
the water 1s a favorite spot for a nesting duck.

NATURAL SONGBIRD HOME: Songbirds seek a variety of

home sites. Hollow trees and the “cradles” of forked branches
are favorites.

SQUIRREL NEST: Squirrels may weave nests that are safe
refuge against the severest storms.

BASS. SPAWNING AREA: Bass prefer gravel beds for
spawning, usually in quiet water.

$10M SPAWNING AREA: Trout like to spawn over gravel
es.

HANDYMAN HOMES

WATER FOR WILDLIFE: Shameful drainage practices and
pollution have ruined many natural aquatic homes for wild-
life. We cannot have healthy wildlife communities Without
adequate supplies of clean, unpolluted water!

FARM POND: Over a million farm ponds have been built in
the U. S. for ﬁshing, swimming, ﬁre protection, and recreation.

LOG DAM: A simple type of stream improvement, log dams
dig homes for ﬁsh, especially trout.

V-DAM: The V—Dam is easy to build and keep up, provides
shelter for ﬁnny residents.

REFORESTATION : Millions of acres of the U. S. are aban-
doned farms and forestlands which could be restored to tim-
ber through planting and by providing protection from ﬁre,
disease and insects.

WILLOWS PLANTED: Willow planting is perhaps the easiest
method of helping prevent streambank erosion. Livestock
should be kept off the newly planted areas.

BRUSH SHELTER: Brush cut and piled makes good tempo-
rary shelter for rabbits and birds.

HEDGEROW: A multiﬁora rose hedge provides food and cover
for birds and small game.

WOOD DUCK BOX: The Woodie is quick to accept help in
solving his housing problem.

DUCK NESTING BOX: In areas where nesting cover is
scarce, mallards readily accept handyman housing.

BIRD HOUSE: Hundreds of varieties of homemade bird-
houses have been accepted by songbirds.

SQUIRREL NESTING BOX: Many species of squirrels
readily move into these constructed shelters.

BASS SPAWNING BOX: This may help smallmouth bass
reproduction, especially in silted areas.

TROUT SPAWNING BED: Where gravel beds are scarce,
manmade spawning beds help trout reproduction.

HOMES FOR WILDLIFE

Planning a Program:

FIRST, decide what wildlife you want to help.

SECOND, make a survey to determine what their needs are. Is there food, shelter,
cover? In short, the essentials for survival of “X-animal” in “X—area”? Your local
conservation biologist or science teacher may be willing to help you in this survey.
Get permission from the person who owns the area you wish to work in before
starting your project.

THIRD. develop a well-organized handyman housing program for the types of
wildlife you have chosen to help.

LAST, DO IT!

PURPOSES OF THE FILM . . .

To show the physical and social requirements of
pets and their dependency upon humans to satisfy
their needs

To illustrate various techniques of pet care:
providing food and shelter, grooming and
cleanliness, recreation and exercise.

To show that having pets is not only fun but a
serious responsibility.

COLLABORATOR: Elizabeth Graf, Ph.D., Pittsburgh Public Schools

 

THlS FILM SHOWS . . .

0 That many kinds of animals make good pets.

0 That most pets require daily care if they
are to be attractive and healthy.

° That pets depend upon humans to satisfy
their needs.

0 That different kinds of pets need different
kinds of food. Pets should not be fed too much
or too often.

0 That keeping pets clean is also important to
their health.

0 That most pets need plenty of rest and
exercise to keep them well and strong.

- That veterinarians help to protect the
health of pets.

0 That some pets should be trained to behave
properly.

0 The speciﬁc care required by pet birds, ﬁsh,
cats, and dogs.

0 That having pets is not only fun but a
responsibility.

. Through the use of live film sequences, students are introduced to the physical and
social needs of all pets. These general principles and requirements of pet care are made
meaningful as the specific techniques in the care of pet canaries, tropical fish, cats,

Bird in cage, singing. Little girl walks up to cage, takes
it off hook, and carries it to kitchen; puts cage on table
covered with papers — 33'
LINDA: Want to take a bath, Tony?
NARRATOR: Pets are fun. But they are also a responsi-
bility. Linda has learned that there are many things
which she must do to keep her canary, Tony, an at-
tractive and healthy pet.

Girl picks up small bowl and fills it with water; places
it on table beside cage —— 46’
LINDA; Just a minute, Tony.
NARRATOR: The water for Tony’s bath mustn’t be either
too hot or too cold. How will Linda get Tony to his
bathtub without letting him out of his cage?

While bird is sitting on perch, she lifts cage, takes out
the bottom and sets bottomless cage over bowl. She then
takes dirty paper from cage bottom and replaces it with
clean — 65’
She slides out the bottom of the cage. So that’s how
she does it! The paper on the floor of the cage gets
dirty and needs to be changed every day or two. Linda
has clean paper ready.

Two containers —— one full of fine gravel, the other full
of birdseed. She puts some of the gravel on floor of
cage —- 74’
This container is filled with fine gravel. Do you know
what the gravel is for? Birds have no teeth. Tony will
swallow some of this gravel, and, inside his stomach,
it will help to grind up the food he eats.

Bird splashing in water -— 82’
Tony bathes by splashing water all over himself. You
can see why Linda covered the table with newspapers.
She wants to keep everything clean.

Linda puts some of bird seed in Tony’s feeder —- 90’
The mixture of seeds in this container is specially pre-
pared for canaries.

Linda puts cage back together and Tony eats. He hops
to his water dish, but it’s empty. Linda takes it, and
Tony goes back to his food — 107’
Tony is through .with his bath, so Linda puts his cage
back together. After his bath, Tony has an appetite.
If Tony were a wild bird, he would have to find his
own food. But since he is a pet, he depends on Linda
for everything he needs.

Linda puts water dish back in cage and carries it back
to window — 120’
Tony will be thirsty after he eats. Linda keeps this
cup filled with fresh, cool water. Tony has had his

bath, his cage is clean, and he has plenty of fresh
food and water. Now he’s ready to spend the day on
his perch by a sunny window.

Fish swimming in tank. Boy watching. CU fish — 133’
Fish make fine pets. But Jack can tell you that fish,
like any other pet, require daily care. The fish in this
aquarium are called fantails. They are a kind of gold-
fish. The fantails are waiting to be fed. Can you see
why they are called fantails?

Boy moves to another tank, full of tropical fish. CU
several different fishes — 142’
The other aquarium is the home of several different
kinds of tropical fish. Tropical fish can live only in
warm water, so Jack see-s to it that their water never
becomes chilled.

Thermometer in water — 146’
Between seventy and eighty degrees is just right.

Water in corner of tank. Beside it is a green plant—155’
This electric water heater warms the water when it
gets too cool. The red light glows when the heater is
working. The green plants Jack keeps in the water
are important. Fish need to breathe just as we all do.

Fish among leaves of plant. CU oxygen bubbles —— 165'
We get our oxygen from the air, but fish get theirs
from water. And green plants give off oxygen into
the water. If you look very closely, you can see the
bubbles of oxygen rising from the plants.

Open drawer full of fish supplies. Jack takes can of
fish food and sprinkles it on water. One fish swims to
top and then immediately away — 177 '
This drawer is where Jack keeps the supplies he needs
to take care of his fish. Jack feeds his fish once a day.
A few pinches of food are enough. Jack knows that
overfeeding his fish would be unhealthy for them. The
fantails don’t seem to be very hungry.

Electric pump pumping air through tube and filter into
water. Jack removes filter unit from water, removes
dirty filter, puts in clean one, replaces lid, and returns
unit to tank —- 208'
This is an electric pump. The pump forces air through
this tube—and the air makes the water in the aquar-
ium pass through this filter. The filter is a device
that keeps the water clean by catching and collecting
any dirt that gets into the water. The dirt is caught
in a soft material called glass wool. This piece of
glass wool has caught so much dirt that Jack must
change it. In a few days, this fresh piece of glass
wool will also be black with dirt it has collected from
the water.

Fantails gasping for air. Jack immediately gets tube
and bucket and siphons water off, puts fresh water in,
and sprinkles fish food on top. Many fish come up to
eat —— 242’
Something’s the matter with the fantails! They’re
gasping! Their water must not have enough oxygen

in it! Jack will have to take care of that. The water
in a goldfish aquarium must be changed every few
weeks. Jack does that, without disturbing the fish,
using a siphon. The siphon is simply a length of tube.
Jack’s father has taught him how to make a siphon
work and how to use it safely. And now some fresh
water, exactly warm enough, poured carefully into one
corner so that it won’t stir up the gravel or frighten
the fish. The fantails are hungry now. It’s fortunate
for them that Jack knows how to take proper care of
his pets.

17. Cat meows at closed door. Door opens, and girl in house-

coat and slippers comes out. Cat runs downstairs, with
girl following. Girl prepares its food. Cat comes in, eats
meat and drinks milk—then starts washing front feet
—— 282'
ANNETTE: Morning, Calico.
NARRATOR: Calico’s favorite food is raw meat cut into
small pieces. Annette knows just about how much
Calico will want for his breakfast. Calico also likes
milk. Annette sees to it that her pet always has some-
thing to drink, either milk or water. After his meal
Calico licks himself clean. Cats try hard to keep
themselves clean, but Annette can help.

Annette takes cat on lap and brushes him; cat lies on

her lap and purrs — 303’
A good brushing every days keeps Calico’s coat clean
and shiny. And there’s another good reason for Cali-
co’s daily brushing. When Calico licks his own fur, he
may swallow loose hairs, and these hairs may collect
into a ball in his stomach and make him sick. A good
daily brushing removes these loose hairs from his
coat.

Annette gives Calico his scratching post; then she
waves goodbye to cat and leaves; cat plays with catnip
mouse —— 337’
ANNETTE: Here’s your scratching post, Calico.
NARRATOR: Annette does something else for Calico be-
fore she leaves for school. Cats need to scratch. It’s
much better for Calico to scratch on his scratching
post than to scratCh the furniture.
ANNETTE: So long, Calico.
NARRATOR: Annette has left a toy for Calico to play
with. She knows that there’s nothing Calico likes bet-
ter than a catnip mouse.

20. Puppy asleep in basket awakens; boy in kitchen is pre-

paring breakfast; he calls to puppy, andopuppy goes to
dish and eats —— 356’
This is Nipper. He’s three months old. This is Terry.
He’s Nipper’s master. Terry is fixing Nipper’s break-
fast —— warm milk over dried puppy food. Nipper has
had a good night’s sleep in his comfortable bed.
TERRY: Soup’s on, Nipper!

 

SCENES SOUND TRACK

NARRATOR: Now he’s ready to eat. Nipper eats three
times a day while he’s a puppy. When he’s older, he
will eat less often.

21. Terry kneeling by door with leash in hand; calls to Nip-
per. Nipper gets into leash, and they go for a walk.
Terry attaches leash to dog run. Nipper runs and runs
— 388’

TERRY: Nipper! Come on, Nipper . . . That’s a boy.
NARRATOR: Terry is training Nipper to walk on a leash.
Nipper still pulls quite a lot and gets himself twisted
up sometimes. This is a dog run. The dog run gives
Nipper plenty of freedom and a chance to get lots of
exercise. It also gives him a chance to get used to
being on a leash.

Terry unhooks Nipper’s leash; walks Nipper back to the
house —— 398’
TERRY: Hi, Nipper boy. You have a good run?
NARRATOR: Soon Nipper will have learned to walk
properly on a leash. Going no slower and no faster
than his master.

Terry bathing Nipper; wraps him up in towel and dries

him — 421’
A good combing and brushing every day does a lot to
keep Nipper clean. But every month or so, Nipper
needs a bath. The water is warm, and Terry uses a
special soap, made for dogs, to clean his pet. After
soaping, Terry gives Nipper a good rinse with warm
water. Terry knows that it’s very important to dry
Nipper thoroughly after his bath. Terry will also
make certain that Nipper stays warm for the next
few hours so that he won’t catch cold.

Terry and Nipper in veterinarian’s office. Nipper gets
rabies shot. The shot seems to hurt Terry worse than
Nipper. —— 441’
That shot will keep Nipper from getting a disease
called rabies. The veterinarian, a doctor for animals,
helps Terry protect the health of his pet. Of course, a
healthy dog is not necessarily a well-behaved one.

Nipper chewing on rug. Terry scolds him, then gives him

a toy. Terry and Nipper play together on floor —— 464'
TEmzy; Don’t chew that rug!
NARRATOR: That’s the way, Terry. Speak firmly to your
dog when he does anything wrong. Here’s something
Nipper can chew on. A toy made of hard rubber. And
Terry praises Nipper for doing the right thing. All
pets require care. Terry knows that it’s his responsi-
bility to take care of his pet, to feed him, to train him,
to keep him clean. In return, a well-cared-for pet like
Nipper will always be ready to give his master pleas-
ure and fun.

ONTARIO HUMANE

SPRING NEWS LETTER FOE ANIMAL DEFENDERS.

BIRDS:

In the Winter we feed the wild birds, in
some cases hel ing to reserve the species.when adverse
weather conditions wou d make living impossible in our

severe climate.

Now we look for the return of the birds as
Spring comes nearer.v Many fly thousands of miles in
their trip North and our bird feeding stations would be
a boon to weary travellers as a "stOp over".

Years ago the tiny humming bird used to be often
seen in Ontario gardens or in some of nature's special
haunts. Now, for various reasons, these beautiful,
iridescent, minute creatures are only seen infrequently.
Not only are they beautiful, but they perform a wonderful
help in fertilizing flowers and increasing the delicious
fruit crOps we enjoy.

There are 319 known species which range from
Cape Horn to Alaska but the ruby throated electric green
specimen is the one known in Ontario. '

Cont'dOOOOOCO

 




-2g'e

zRed and pinkflowers seem to attract them
most, PeaCh and Almond Blossom, Sweet Bergamot, Salvias
and Cannas, though in August I have seen them frequently
hovering on the Buddleia Bushes which are white, blue,
pink and lavender. Their wing beats between 55 to 75
to the second, producing a soft whirring sound which can
be heard if you have the patience to keep quiet and listen.

The female lays two white eggs in a minute nest
not much bigger than a thimble.. About 1%" in diameter,
it is built of bud scales held together with spider
silks, lined with down from plants and covered with
lichen. They place it 15 to 20 feet up on a bush,
usually in woodland near running water. Their food
consists of small insects, nectar, sap, and they will
take sugar and water from artificial feeders. These
usually consist of an upright glass tube which has a
little funnel inserted into the base. The funnel or tube
has an artificial flower at the outside end which is
painted red. The bird extracts the sugar water through
the centre of the flower. The tOp of the tube has a
cork inserted to keep flies and insects, which are also
partial to sugar water, out.

Animal Defenders would do well to study these
fascinating little creatures. The range of.the ruby '
throated humming bird is from Nova Scotia, Ontario and
South Alberta to Florida, the Gulf Coast and west to
East Texas, East Kansas and North Dakota, in which
areas it breeds. In winter, when its ruby throat
changes to white, it travels from Central Florida and
to Louisiana south through Mexico and Panama.

Before we leave the subject of birds, I would
like to warn enthusiastic Animal Defenders to think
before they act! In the Spring, when the eggs of birds
have been laid, incubated and hatched, there follows
the usual nursery training for most young birds. . As
soon as possible the parents want_to teach the birds to
fend for themselves and one of the first lessons is
learning to fly. These lessons often_get interrupted
by human beings who stumble right into the "class room".
On most such occasions the parents are able to call the
fledgeling to safety, but sometimes when the parents
call the 'babe' to hide he is too slow, and this is where
we come in. Thinking the bird is lost or injured, we

I do not at this time know anything about his plans. He may tell

he is here he might see someone at NETC (Rational Education &

local channel in California and had appeared on their Programs

at various times. I still think it would be a good idea to see
someone at headquarters, though, while he is here, for I think
things are happening there in broadening out - you may know more

5 ,' Foot 9 Inch Snake Gives
1; ,. Realism to Nature Study

By WILLIAM E. FARRELL
Martin Frey walked along a

crowded corridor of P. S. 101 ’

recently with a 5 foot 9 inch
boa constrictor entwined about
his right arm.

The mottled yellow and
brown snake is named Bobo and
is the mascot 0f the East Har-
lem elementary school on East“

111th Street, between Parkland .

Lexington Avenues. She is
owlned by Mr. Frey, the princi-
a .

“Mira, mira [look, look],"a
little Spanish boy exclaimed as
Mr. Frey and Bobo, who is three
years old,’ headed toward a
third-grade classroom.

“It’s that snake,” a girl said
nonchalantly.

“Hi, Bobo, " another girl
whispered.

Mr. Frey keeps Bobo at
school because he likes snakes
and because he thinks Bobo in-
creases the children’s interest
in nature study. The reptile
will grow 7 to 8 feet longer as
it matures. It has no venom
and is not dangerous.

Miss Rose Aronoff, a
third-grade teacher, greeted
Mr. Frey.

“They asked all last week to
see the snake,” she told him.

Mr. Frey unraveled Bobo
from around his arm and held
her with both hands. The class
squealed delightedly.

An Easy Nature Lesson

“Who knows her name 1’," he
asked.

Several hands went up and
several children shouted: “BO~

“Who’d like to hold her?"

All the boys raised their
hands.

“Who’d like to touch her but
not hold her ?"

All but one girl in the class
of 25 raised their hands.

"What does she eat ?"

“Snakes eat birds and insects
and eggs,” a boy replied.

Mr. Frey continued the na-
ture lesson while Bobo made
her way along the lapels of his
neat gray suit. Her small hand-
somely marked head jutted out
several feet.

The ‘class decided a snake

it preyed on birds and kept
them from devouring seeds.

The children took turns hold-

Mr. Frey asked. -
“Sticky,” said one boy.
“Smooth,” said another.
“Both," a girl replied.

girl felt brave enough to hold

THE VERY TIRED AND BADI.Y WORN
“RABIES” SCARE

The “RABIES“ scare became very familiar to me when I
was working as a poisoner with the Predator Control Branch
of the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Through that expe-
rience. and then down through the years since. when gather-
ing all the documents and information I can, along with time
spent in the ﬁeld where the tragedies from poisons occur; and
noting closely the absence of animals and birds, and also the
absence of their sign; I have become far more fearful of the
poisoner‘s “RABIES" scare than I am of all the possibilities of
having a harmful outbreak of rabies. I will now give some of
the reasons for my fear:

1. Working as a poisoner under the source of the “RABIES”
scare. I came to realize I was degrading myself to a very
low degree of deception by placing out of sight animals.
birds. and dogs l did not want the public to see. Among
the dogs l poisoned were children‘s pets. and valuable
working dogs. To make very deceptive procedures worse,
I put the poisoned coyotes on hold display to make it ap-
pear l was poisoning only coyotes. Taking part in such
rank deception was what caused me to state when I re-
fused to work with the poison. that: WHEN THERE IS
ANYTHING THAT (‘ANNOT STAND ON THE
TRUTH AND ITS OWN MliRlTS. THERE IS SURE-
LY SOMETHING VERY HARMFULLY WRONG!

. It is through the source of the “RABIES" scare that our
best hunting is being wasted. a situation that is ably re-
vealed by Ben East in the March. 1963 issue of “OUT-
DOOR LIFE". It is through this same source that there
are those of us who have been forced to the conclusion
that a government agency has been sold to private in-
terests lock. stock and barrel. in total disregard for the
interests of the general public. and apparently in disre-
gard for the ﬁndings and attitudes of the American So-
ciety of Mammalogists. We read that back in 1931 the
American Society of Mammalogists adopted a resolution
urging the (then) Biological Survey to curtail the use of
poison, restrict misleading propaganda against predatory
species, and give more consideration to rights of the gen-
eral public.

. It was because of the source of the “RABIES" scare that
I received a letter telling of an employee being requested
to stuff sheep‘s wool into the stomach of a dead animal to
make it appear this animal had been a sheep killer. It
was because of this same source, that I read when the em-
ployee resigned, the poisoners claimed he had been dis-
charged, and about six months passed before he could—
with the help of a sheepman friend—get a paper showing
he had resigned. It was because of the source of the

“RABIES" scare that a cattleman wrote wondering if real
cattlemen are expected to believe their propaganda that
bobcats ride calves around while eating them alive.

.Dr. E. Raymond Hall speaking on behalf of the De-
fenders of Wildlife at Corpus Christi, Texas, this last No-
vember had this to say: “So far as I can learn, onlyﬁve
persons died of rabies last year in all of the United
States.” And he went on to say: “Nevertheless, the im-
age of rabies in the ‘popular mind’ is such that it can be
used to frighten most persons. Today it is being used in
that fashion; the dangers are being overemphasized as an
excuse for initiating expensive and extensive control cam-
paigns against mammals."

.When faced with the “RABIES” scare, let us remember
Senator Arnold Rieder of Montana when he wrote of
eliminating the source from where we get the scare: “OF
COURSE THIS WOULD PUT SOME MEN OUT OF
WORK AND SAVE THE TAXPAYERS MONEY, AND
THESE SO-CALLED BIOLOGISTS WOULD BE VERY
UNHAPPY, AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE
WOOLGROWERS ASSOCIATIONS WOULD PUT UP
A HOWL—LOUDER THAN ANY COYOTE COULD
MUSTER." Of course that is the HOWL we get through
the “RABIES“ scare.

Ex-Ofﬁcial Government Poisoner and
Retired Hunter and Trapper

Note from Mrs. Marguerite A. Smelzer. San Bernardino. Cal—
i/ornia:

I have known Lester Reed for six years. He is a man of
integrity. In my nature writings, he has furnished me
with authoritative information on the dangers of poisons
used in predator eontrol—particularly sodium fluoroacete,
commonly called 1080. “Control” is a euphemism mean-
ing “Kill”.

ﬁr ﬁr * ‘k *

Mrs. Smelser is a Member of the Board of Directors of
Defenders of Wildlife. If you would like to know the
story of Lester Reed and his ﬁght against poisons, please
send to Defenders of Wildlife for .Mrs. Smelser’s “Un—
trollahle 'Control'."

* ‘k at ‘k *

Defenders of Wildlife disapprove of the artiﬁcial creation
of human rabies-hysteria in order to secure approval for wide-
spread indiscriminate slaughter campaigns against the "preda-
tors". We disapprove because it is cruel and biologically un-
sound for all concerned. Rabies is extremely rare. especially in
man. and it is now more easily treated. We disapprove of tax
money being wasted for such "control" work. and of citizens be-
ing unjustiﬁably terrorized when rabies is said to exist. and co-
erced into cooperative activities designed to eradicate or dras-
tically reduce the normal population of ﬂesh-eating mammals.
It is thought by biologists that indiscriminate reduction of
populations, if rabies is present. prolongs a high level of rabies
infection. If not unbalanced by "predator control" activities,
the spread of the rabies organism may shortly kill all suscep-
table animals, leaving only the resistant or immune animals
alive.

September, 1963

Largest of the antelope family is the
eland, which is found only in Africa. It
is graceful and light on its feet despite
its size.

A full-grown eland stands almost six
feet high at the shoulders. It may weigh
as much as 1,200 pounds. With a slight
hump at its shoulders and a lose ﬂap of
skin under its neck, the eland looks
somewhat like an ox—but it is much
more graceful than an ox.

A playful eland can jump right over
the top of another eland. An ox could
never do that.

Often two elands will play a game, in
which they lock horns and try to push
each other. They never seem to hurt each
other in this game. They will push until
they get tired, stop and rest awhile, then
lock horns and start pushing all over
again.

The eland was given its name by Dutch
settlers in Africa. Eland is the Dutch
word for “elk,” and it seemed a reasonable
name since the eland is large like the elk.

Being a member of the antelope family,
however, the eland really is more closely
related to the mountain goat than it is

to the elk. The elk belongs to the deer
family of animals.

A young eland may be slightly reddish
in color, with faint white stripes along
its sides. As it grows, its color fades into
a fawn tone in which the stripes hardly
show. When it gets old, the eland has a
blue-gray appearance. Elands travel in
herds of four or five up to 200. They
feed on grass and leaves.

Streamlined as a torpedo, the tuna obviously
is built for swimming— and swimming is what
it does every moment of its life. Nobody ever
has seen a tuna that was not swimming, unless
it was dead or dying.

The tuna can swim in spurts up to 40 miles
an hour. On the average it swims about nine
or ten miles an hour. Since it never stops
swimming, it can be calculated that a tuna will
travel a million miles or more in its average
lifetime of 12 to 15 years.

Tuna are found in most of the temperate
waters of the world. They are a salt water ﬁsh,
of course, not to be found in inland fresh water
streams or lakes. They are found in both the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and in the
Mediterranean Sea.

Tuna travel in huge schools. They have been
compared to packs of wolves, because they pursue
their prey so relentlessly. Smaller fishes or squid
are usually their prey.

Young tuna of the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean area hatch in the vicinity of the
Strait of Gibraltar. Some of the Paciﬁc tuna
hatch off the coast of Central America. Other
Paciﬁc tuna hatch near the Philippine Islands
and in areas around the Caroline and Marshall
Islands.

Tuna are considered to be mature when they
are three years old. At that time they usually
weigh about 30 pounds. They keep on growing,
however, and eventually reach a tremendous ’size.
Paciﬁc and Mediterranean tuna often reach a
Weight of 500 pounds. Atlantic tuna occasionally
weigh more than 1, 000 pounds.

Tuna are related to the mackerel, another

fr . far-ranging ﬁsh. They also are related to the

' swordﬁsh, sailﬁsh, and marlin.

SOme birds can sing chords; that is, two 0r
three distinct notes at the same time.

The butterﬂy ﬁsh often swims backwards, its
tail appearing to be its head.

There are more than 7,000 different kinds of
ants.

There are at least 30,000 different kinds of
ﬁshes.

A camel can drink 25 gallons of water in a

half hour.

An opossum is no larger than a honey bee at
birth.

. n, Wild-
11f“: faI‘ming, and many other outdoor
activities. A 4—H Club is not just a
youth organization, but a way of life --
a way of life that is disappearing from
the American scene. Why do so many young-
stvrs today show so little respect for
animals and nature? Perhaps it's because
they have never been given the chance to
learn, never had the opportunity to deal
with life on a no—nonsense, responsible
level. 4‘H is very much a part of the
youth's everyday life. The 4-H boy and
girl learn by doing and every 4-H member
must have a project. When this has been
successfully completed, another project
is begun. This is the 4-H way of learn-
ing.

In Massachusetts, there are 4-H Clubs

in both urban and rural areas. Youngsters
learn to work and plan together under
boy or girl

skilled leadership and any
between the ages of 10 and
to “learn by doing” may enroll.

WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF 4-H CLUB WORK?

There are 4-H Clubs in 12 counties 1n
Massachusetts under the guidance of over
3,000 volunteer leaders, with about
13,000 members. Nationally, there are
95,000 4-H Clubs with more than 2,300,000
members, and over 70 countries have youth
programs that have adopted all or part
of the 4-H plan.

Many people in other lands have learned
about 4-H Club work through the Inter-
national Farm Youth Exchange Program.
Each year the Massachusetts 4-H Founda-
tion sends some of its 4-H’ers to other
lands to live, work, and share experl-

ences with foreign families for several
months.

Wherever they are, 4-H Club membiz:

family cooperation, and better wor
understanding.

 

 

WHAT IS THE u-H PLEDGE?

I pledge my head to clearer thinking;
my heart to greater loyalty. my handiter
larger service, and my health to be

. . - nd

my country.

WHAT IS THE 4-H MOTTO?
To make the best better.

 

WHO CONDUCTS 4-H CLUB WORK?

The 4-H Club program in each county is
administered by a County 4-H Agent, who
has as many as 2,400 members in his
county. To help carry out the program, he
must rely on volunteer leaders, who are
adults skilled in teaching various proi-
ects to youngsters and who are dedicated
to the idea of 4-H Club work. The Massa—
chusetts 4-H Foundation helps to pay for
the training of the more than 3,000 vol-
unteer leaders who help to carry out the

4-H program, but who receive no pay for
the work they do.

 

WHO SUPPORTS THE 4-H PROGRAM?

is a non-profit, charitable,

often lost sight of society’s real, human
needs.

4-H, geared to developing character and
helping young people to mature thought-
fully, needs everyone’s help if it is to
succeed.

Would you please help to continue and
expand 4-H Club work by sending a dona-
tion to the Massachusetts 4-H Foundation?

The Massachusetts 4-H Foundation, Inc.
Box 573, Amherst, Mass.

Yes, I want to take part in the cam-
paign to support the Massachusetts 4-H
Club program.

Enclosed is $_ to help our
4-H’ers to be all they hope to be.

In recent months we have noted a great many cancellation messages
such as "Save Heter", "At Easter Help Crippled Children”, "Natianal
Children’s Dental Health week“, ”Sales Abroad ﬂake Jobs at Home”, ”Support
Ybur Local Science Fail", etc.

we should like respectfully to request that you caneider a cancellatian
message exereseing the importance cf kindness to animals. A cancellation
message currently being used in Belgium was sent to us recently by a member
there. It states: ”Men degrades himself by mistreating an animal”. Other
suggestions might be the simple statement ”Be Kind to Animals." or a brief

quotation from Dr. Albert Schweitzer: ”we need a boundless ethics which will
include the animals also.”

we should be glad to discuss this matter in person with the appropriate
authorities of the post office, either in Hashengton or New Yerk.

Thanking you inaadvence for yeur assistance in advancing the cause cf
Kindness to animals, I am

Miss Estella Draper, Executive Secretary

Dear Miss Draper:

I appreciate receiving your letter of April 15 relating to former
correspondence that we had about thehuman biology projects.

I did make a study of this tOpic and reported it to the Board of
Managers of the National Congress of Parents and Teachers. How-
ever, this was not the kind of research that was worthy of pub—
lication and the information was of an advisory nature and there-
fore was not made public.

I will say, however, that as much as you have seen no follow-up
activity on the part of the National Congress you can assume
that our findings did not call for any action recommendations.

Thank you very much for sending me information and for your interest
in this matter.

Sincerely yours,

My dear Christine:

I meant to send you this cligging sometime
ago 1nd only just today came on in in one of the alps
of m i1 and clippings etc. on my desk. I‘m sure you
have people on your staff who clip everything_about
animals but there was something about this story that
yarticularly caught me; "the animal as teacher”—~that
sort of idea. I think people tend to forget this side
of the animal's meaning to us. I cas so struck with
the third paragraph "The dogs are used to hely the
[delinguentjyouths relax, to win confidence and to learn
friendshis, love, loyalty and obedience."

All the best as always,

affectionately,

BOY SCOUT
DOG CARE KIT

 




HOW TO TAKE CARE OF

Copyright, American Humane Association, Denver, Colo.

 

 




 

Why Care?

There are two reasons why anyone who owns
a dog should give it the best care possible:

1. It’s simply not sporting, or moral, to make
an animal dependent upon you and then duck
the responsibility. It’s a matter of playing fair.

2. The dog owner who makes a friend of his
pet and keeps it in good health gets the most for
his money. Pets are kept to give pleasure. The
most pleasure comes from happy pets. Being
kind is being smart!

Feeding

If it is at all possible, let the mother dog re~
main fully in charge of feeding puppies until
they are about four weeks old and don’t try to
vsieian puppies until they are at least six weeks
0 .‘

Some bitches do not have enough milk for
their litters, however, and sometimes puppies
are deprived of their mothers by accident or
other circumstance. In that case, the most con-
venient substitute for bitch’s milk is “Esbilac,” a
product of the Borden Company, sold at most
pet stores and some groceries and drug stores.
Or you can use evaporated milk and water,
mixed in equal quantities, with one tablespoon
of white Karo syrup and two or three drops of
cod-liver oil added to a day’s ration. A new-
born puppy must be fed every three hours, night
gn‘dﬂday, with an eye-dropper or small nursing
o e.

At two weeks of age some beef bouillon or
meat juice may be added to the diet. At three
weeks you may begin mixing an egg yolk into
the formula every other day, and at about three
or four weeks the puppy may be introduced to
meat in the form of scrapings from a lean cut
of beef. Use a dull knife and scrape off only a
teaspoonful or two for the introductory meals.

Beyond this point, positive statements about
the best diet for dogs are invitation to argument.
Elvery dog breeder and every veterinarian has
hls own pet feeding formula and routine. There
are at least a few points, however, where com-
mon sense brings approximate agreement.

A .pup of the medium-sized breeds (springer
Spanlel, Irish terrier, small setters, etc.) might
get thls dlet in the 6 to 14-week period:

Breakfast: 5 tablespoons of homogenized milk
or evaporated milk, 4 tablespoons of cooked Pab-
lum (that’s an infant food, sold in all groceries).

M id—morning: 2 tablespoons of minced beef
or horsemeat, mixed with a minced hard-boiled

egg.
M id-afternoon: repeat the breakfast menu.

Evening: 2 tablespoons of meat and a table-
spoon of cottage cheese.

Twice a week put four drops of concentrated
cod-liver oil or haliver oil on the meat.

Small-breed dogs will take a little less than
this, big-breed dogs more.

Beginning at 14 weeks, gradually substitute
a commercial puppy meal for the Pablum, but
supplement the meal with a teaspoon of fat
(lard, butter, salad oil, margarine). You also
can cut out the mid—morning snack while in-
creasing quantities at other meals. At 14 weeks
the pup should be eating 5—8 tablespoons of meat
in the afternoon. At night it should get the
same quantity of meat plus about 5 teaspoons
of chopped raw or cooked green or yellow vege-
tables. Mix with meat.

You can drop the afternoon lunch at six
months and gradually substitute a kibbled bis—
cuit (meal in small chunks) for the puppy meal.
Use your judgment about quantities. No two
dogs are identical in their needs. Continue to
supplement the commercial meal with fats
(about one tablespoon for 20 pounds of dog
weight) and keep adding a vitamin and mineral
supplement.

A full grown medium-sized dog, one year of
age or older, needs only one meal a day (best
given at night) but an extra morning snack will
make the dog happier. A good diet might be:
one to one and one-half cups of meat, two cups
of kibbled biscuit, and one and one-half table—
spoons of fat. The meat may be horsemeat or
beef. Liver, heart, kidney or brains are good
but not as a regular diet. Pork is not good.

Many canned dog foods lack some essential
food quality. Read the label! Buy the Best!
There is nothing wrong with table scraps either,
But gon’t neglect to add enough fat to balance

e iet.

And a ﬁnal, very important word; ALWAYS
keep fresh, clean, cool water where your dog
can help himself. A dog without water can suffer

real anguish. Moreover, water is necessary to
1118 health.

Shelter

Housing for a dog is more than merely a
matter of providing protection from the weather.
The housing arrangements can make the differ-
ence between a happy, affectionate, companion-
able dog, and a dog that will be surly and no
pleasure to you.

In almost all cases when a dog is kept as a
pet, he should be a “house” dog—he should
zleep 1n the house and regard your house as his

ome.

It is entirely possible for a dog to live in a
backyard “dog house,” provided the kennel is
wind-tight, watertight, and well insulated
against heat and cold. It is likely, however, that
if you house your dog in an outside kennel, he
won’t get nearly as much of your companionship
as he would if he lived in your own home. It is
also likely that you won’t notice onsets of ill-
ness as quickly as you would if the dog were
a real member of the family.

All dogs—baby or adult—need a bed that is
protected from drafts. A grown dog can stand
low temperatures but not drafts. The bed need
be no more than a clean cloth sack stuffed with
cedar shavings, or a couple of old quilts or
blankets. Put the bed in a corner of some room
where it. is away from windows and doors and
out of traffic. The dog—even a pup—will quickly
adopt it as his private property and his refuge.
It is important to keep the bed clean.

Care in Health
And Sickness

Dogs, like people, sometimes suffer from a
variety of diseases, tummy-aches and miscella-
neous ailments. Anyone who takes a dog into
hIS family is morally obligated to give the dog
the same care, when it is ill or in pain, that he
would give to himself.

VVho’s the doctor? You are the “doctor” re-
sponsible for the general, everyday good health
of your pet. You are the one who guaranteed
to meet his basic demands for food, water, exer-
c1se, cleanliness and housing. You are not the
doctor when your pet is sick. Don’t try to be.
Diagnosing disease in animals is not a job for
amateurs. Let the professional do it. The pro-
fessional is . . .

Your Veterinarian

The degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
is conferred only after years of extensive train-
ing which includes laboratory and clinical ex-
perience. Your Veterinarian has to keep abreast
of modern medical developments, including the
uses of the newest drugs.

Most Veterinarians are interested in keeping
your dog healthy. They can teach you how to
take care of your pet, and advise you about
problems that may arise. When you ﬁrst adopt a
dog, take it to the Veterinarian of your choice.
Your dog should then be inoculated against dis-
temper and hepatitis, diseases which needlessly
kill so many ﬁne dogs each year. In many com-
munities, the law requires an annual rabies inoc-
ulation. You will ﬁnd that taking your dog to
your Veterinarian for a periodic check-up will
save your pet much misery and prolong the
years of his life.

Veterinarians do give many hours of free serv-
ice to humane organizations. They are 1nterested
in your pets, and 1n pet owners. ‘

Grooming Is Essential

When you groom your dog, you are not pamp-
ering him or fussing over him. You are not
spoiling him. You are protecting his health. Just
as unkempt hair, ragged nails, and discolored
teeth are marks of poor personal hygiene, they
are equally poor pet hygiene. Every dog needs
a certain amount of brushing to keep his coat
in good condition and stimulate his skin. For
the long-haired breeds whose coats can mat and
tangle beyond help, almost daily grooming is
needed.

Bathing, surprisingly enough, is less important.
Actually, too frequent bathing can be harmful as
it removes the natural oils and encourages a
variety of skin inﬂammations. A well and fre-
quently groomed dog may not need a bath more
than twice a year.

As you brush your dog, you can check on his
skin condition, keeping a watch for skin dis-
eases, ﬂeas and ticks. Brushing is not the whole
story of grooming. Nails need to be clipped at
regular intervals, ears need to be cleaned inside
and the tartar scraped off his teeth. This can be
done at home but do let your Veterinanian show
you how before you do it alone.

 




Handling and Training

If you have a puppy, remember that it is a
baby. Children, especially, should have this
fact impressed upon them. A dog in the home
can help to develop desired character traits in
a child—kindness, responsibility, thoughtfulness.
Help children to see the animal as a friend and
companion—not as a toy. A child that is allowed
to abuse an animal—however innocently—is
being encouraged in callousness, thoughtlessness
and selﬁshness.

A puppy should not be picked up with a grip
around its stomach. The baby stomach is tender
and the internal organs are easy to injure. To
lift a pup, put one hand between the front legs
and the other hand behind the back legs.

Don’t keep the puppy playing until he is
exhausted. He needs lots of rest and sleep.

Handle a grown dog according to his tempera-
ment. Some dogs love to be affectionately pushed
around but some dogs prefer their dignity. Let
the dog choose.

All experts are agreed that a dog is much
more easily trained with kindness than with
punishment. When your dog does what you
want him to do, praise him, pat him, give him
a favorite dog biscuit. For example: don’t punish
a dog for running across the street; instead,
praise and reward him for learning to come
when called, and sit when ordered. It’s not just
kindness—it’s the best way to get the results
you want.

Training can be simple or it can be compli-
cated. You are the one to decide how much edu-
cation your dog needs. Housebreaking comes
ﬁrst. Next you may want to teach him how to
behave in certain everyday situations . . . to

“sit”, “heel”, and “stay”.

Remember—dogs learn best in a quiet atmos-
phere. A low but commanding tone of voice
works most effectively. Always use the same
commands; do not lose your temper; always re-
ward when your command is obeyed. Training
ought to be fun for both master and pet.

Breeding

The best advice about breeding, in 99 cases
out of 100, is DON’T.

There are far more puppies being born every
year than are needed or wanted. Animal shelters
and municipal pounds are flooded with the sur-
plus. Humane organizations work hard to ﬁnd
homes for even a small percentage of the strays
they pick up. We recommend that you consider
spaying your female pet. They do make a good
house pet.

A spayed female does not need to become
lethargic and fat as is commonly thought. If you
keep in mind the principles of good feeding,
you will understand that an active pet uses up
more energy and therefore will need more food.

One Last Word
About Good-Eyes!

When you adopt a pet, you are responsible
for his arrival in your home. You are equally
responsible for his departure! If for some reason
you must get rid of your pet, do try to ﬁnd
him a good home. Your pet has learned to rely
on you for everything. He looks to you as his
protector. So if you cannot ﬁnd a good home,
ask your humane organization for help. Aban~
cloning pets is cruel and irresponsible. But is is
done by otherwise self-respecting citizens.

Then there is a different kind of good—bye . . ..
the necessity for parting with a pet who is either

too old or too sick to enjoy life with you any-
more. If your pet is hopelessly ill and suffering,
the greatest kindness you can offer is a painless
death. Your Veterinarian or humane organiza-
tion can provide this.

And not far away there will always be a fat,

wriggly puppy or a mature dog only too willing
to share your life.

Your Humane
Organization

_There are more than 600 societies concerned
Wlth the prevention of cruelty to animals in the

United States and Canada. Your own organiza-
tion may be known as an SPCA, a Humane So-
ciety, or an Animal Defense League. Whatever
the name, most of these societies, federated in
The American Humane Association, are working
constantly to protect animals from cruelty. It
is worthwhile for any animal owner to know
about his local humane organization. If you
have any problem that might involve suffering
for your pet, your society will be happy to offer
advice and help.

Most humane organizations operate animal
shelters, which provide temporary homes for
animals that are unwanted or that have strayed
and got lost. All of these shelters offer dogs,
kittens, cats. and other animals for adoption by
people who will give the animals good homes.

Many humane organizations also provide am-
bulance service for ill and injured animals.

In addition, humane society experts investi-
gate reports of cruelty; they make regular in-
spections of stockyards, poultry markets, and
slaughter-houses; they advise law—makers on
many kinds of legislation affecting animals and
animal owners; they conduct educational pro-
grams that teach kindness and compassion to
hundreds of thousands of children; they pro-
vide euthanasia (painless death) for animals for
which that is the most merciful course.

All of this is important to you as an animal
owner. Learn the name and address of your
local humane organization and get acquainted
with it. If you do not ﬁnd a humane organiza—
tion in your immediate vicinity, ask The Ameri-
can Humane Association, 896 Pennsylvania
Street, Denver, Colorado, for the name and ad-
dress of the society nearest you. Then, when you
need advice and help in any animal problem,
you will know where to turn for expert and
friendly help.

Your local society will be happy to have your
ﬁnancial support. A letter or phone call will
bring information about the local program and
how it is ﬁnanced.

Structural details for
each of the 4 walls is found on
the inside page. A more detailed
corner view shows how the corner
joints are made. When assembled
the four walls make a box unit as
shown above.

The floor is construct-

ed of tongue and groove boards and
is four feet square. For adequate
ventilation and to keep free from
dampness, the floor is nailed at
right angles to three 2x4 cross
members as shown in the two views
of the floor diagram on the inside
page.

The two side
walls are slotted vertically for
the partition. Slide the parti—
tion down the slots parallel with
the front wall with partition open-
ing away from the door.

The picture below shows the four
main parts. To simplify moving,
cleaning, or painting the home may
be separated into its four compon-
ents.

At each corner of the floor is
a 6 inch piece of 2x4 to guide and
place the box in correct position.

This panel is the
windbreak. It is constructed of
the tongue and groove and these
are held in place by four l"x2"
stringers.

The roof section consists
of the top surface, constructed of
tongue and groove stock. The side
panels are constructed of l"x6"
stock as shown on the plans.

Pictured below is the underside
of the roof showing relative posi-
tion of the 2 stops that positions
the roof when opened for airing.
The stops are made of 2x4 stock and
are 8 inches long.

 

 




 

A|R|NG : To air, prop the roof
as shownixlthe above illustration.

Structural details of prop are shown

in plans.

CLEANING :This dog house was
designed for easy cleaning. Simply
remove the roof, the center parti—
tion, and push the house over on
any side as shown above. In this
open position it may be thoroughly

scrubbed and hosed with little
effort.

Not all dogs are privileged to
live in the house, and many dogs
prefer the out of doors. If the
dog is to be kept out of doors,
then the dog house described on
these pages will be quite adequate.

A flap of several folds made of
either burlap, canvas or an old
carpet nailed overtﬁmadoorway will
keep out drafts and give added
warmth.

A dog living outcﬁ doors should
have a fenced in yard. If not, he
shouldlxeon a light chain fastened
to an overhead clothes line or on
a swivel stake. The swivel stake
cantxzpurchased at most pet supply
houses and is very easy to install.
A chained dog should have easy ac-
cess to his house, water,zunlfood.

All of this is important to you
as an animal owner. Learn the name
and address of your local humane
organization and get acquainted
with it. If you do not find a hum-
ane society in your immediate vicin-
ity, ask the American Humane Asso-
ciation, SCJe Pennsylvania St.,
Denver, Colorado for the name and
addresscﬁ the society nearest you.
Then, when you need advice or help
in any animal problem, you will
know where to turn for expert and
friendly help.

THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION

What We Are

The Ame rican Humane Association was or-
ganized by the first national conference of hu-
mane societies, held in Cleveland in 1877. It
was evident, even at that early date, that only
through national organization could the local
societies and the thousands of isolated individ-
ual humane workers achieve national power 3.»
gainst cruelty.

At first the new Association Operated al-
most exclusively as. the means of organizing
annual conventions of humane workers. It was
soon evident that there was much more to be
done. How were local humane societies to deal
with cruel interstate tranSportation of animals ?
How could a local society for protectionof chil-
dren benefit from the experiences of SPCC's
elsewhere? How were new humane societies to
be organized and helped? The obvious answer
was a strong national organization.

The Association was formally chartered in
the District of Columbia in 1903. Headquarters
was permanently established in Albany, New
York, in 1905, moved to Denver in 1954.

Today almo st everyhumane society in Amer-
ica that meets AHA standards of humane work is
a member of the Association. The affiliated so-
cieties have more than a million members. In
addition, the Association invites all humanitar—
ians to direct membership in the Association.

The Association is governed by a Board of
Directors, elected by the Association's mem~
bership. Because the Association has strong
membership in every state and territory of the
United States and because the Board of Directors
includes representation of every major section
of the country, the Association is today, more
than ever before, truly the heart of the humane
movement.

Law and Your Dog

In must communities, dogs must be li-
censed. By all means buy your license regu-
larly and promptly. The money helps to main-
tain services that are of special benefit to dog
owners. Be sure that your dog wears the num-
bered tag that usually is issued with a license.
Many lost dogs could be restored to grieving
families if only that little tag were on the dog's
collar.

The law about ”control" of rings varies from
community to community. Learn what your lo-
cal law is. Your local humane society can tell
you the rules. In many communities any dog at
large, even if licensed, may be picked up by dog
wardens.

Your Humane Society

It is worth while for any animal owner to
know about his lecal humane organization. If
you have any problem that might involve suffer-
ing for your pet, your humane society will be
happy to offer advice and help.

Most humane societies operate animal shel-
ters, which provide temporary homes fer ani-
mals that are unwanted or that have strayed and
got lost. All of these shelters offer kittens , cats,
and other animals for adaption by peeple who
will give the animals good homes .

Many humane societies also provide ambu-
lance service for ill and injured animals.

In addition, humane societyexperts investi—
gate reports of cruelty; they make regular in--
Spections of stockyards, poultry markets, and
slaughter-houses; they advise lax «makers on
many kinds of legislation affecting animals and
animal owners; they conduct educational pro-
grams that teach kindness and compassion to
hundreds of thousands of children; they provide
euthanasia (painless death) for animals for which
that is the most merciful course.
