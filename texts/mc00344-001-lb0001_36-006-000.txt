Mr. Grissman's name could be submitted during the first week of

Gentlemen;

In connection with the award to be made in the near future for
outstanding “Animal‘hork”, I would like to submit the name of hrs.Bonita
Adolph, 601 Brockenbrough Court, New Orleans, Louisiana, for your consid-
oration.

I have known hrs. Adolph long and well during which time she has
worked untiringly and faithfully to help all animals, particularly the
“stray". As a result of her efforts, hundreds of abandoned or lost animals
have been placed in good homes. In order to accomplish this, it was nec-
essary to first board them, run ads in the local newspapers, at her own ex-
pense, spend several hours contacting answers to these ads as well as inves-
tigating homes before placing said animals. Too, Mrs. Adolph now has 21 dogs
of her own; these are animals which she had attempted to secure homes for but
was unable to do so for one reason or other.

All of the above was done at a great personal sacrifice as Mrs.
Adolph is a person.of moderate means. Her efforts to help the stray animals
have been unlimited and too nwmerous to mention. However, I know that if
you‘will contact the following persons they will add to what I have already
said concerning Mrs. Adolph.

@r. V. LiRocchi, Jr. Veterinarian, 5501 So.
Uarrolton Are., New Orleans, La.

Miss Gertrude Trottman, 2522 Jefferson Ave.,
New Orleans, Louisiana

Mrs. S. P. Baudier, 2715 Milan Street

Thanking you for your consideration in the above, I am,

Yours very truly,

Dear Sirs:

In sending you the name of this benefactor to the canine
world may I add that it is in some measure the concern of e9ch
and every one of us to bring to light the kindn999 of humene
people. -To bring help to the h9l9less has always been the
mission and privilege of strongs Houl and surely no victim
of man's inhumanity ever appealed more poignantly for help
then the forgotten little stray deg without 9 friend.

Mrs . Bonita Adolph of €10 Brockenbraugh Gt., Weteirie Louisiana
has, indeed, befriended thes se humble beings with.niuch sacrifice
to herself through out the years. She is 9 tireless worker
housing and caring for twenty- -one degs that she found wandering
the streets ;in search of food. Her humenits rien efftrts extend
far and beyond her humble little home and community. When one
dog dies she replaces it with another. I can 9t;test to her be»
nevolence and work, offtimes beyond her strength, finding homes
for strays, never shutting her eyes to th eir misery, paying ior
veterinary services, and Weeping over them when they pass on.
Living the higher principle of one 911— extending ell preserv»
ing soul; connecting each be 9ing greatest With the lee st.

Sincerely,

Dear Mrs Stevens,

Now that you will be home again, I expect, after your continental
travels, I feel I must write as one of the many who so greatly enjoyed
the party which you gave at the Connaught Hotel on the occasion of the
presentation of your Schweitzer Medal to Major Hume. I would just like
to express my personal appreciation of your most generous hospitality.

I have been attending UFAW (or at first ULAWS) functions since the
early 1930's (how dating that remark becomes!) and I am sure I have
never enjoyed one more. The setting, with excellent service and
delightful food and wine, and our gracious hostess all too modestly

in the background, seemed perfect for such a happy occasion, and I am
sure it gave everyone as well as myself very great pleasure to see
Major Hume's efforts on behalf of animals so magnificently rewarded.

Please accept my sincere and warm appreciation of having been
included in your party, and with very best wishes for the continued
success of your own efforts on behalf of animals,

Yours very sincerely,

Jami/My 001124;»

P.S. This letter, of course, needs no reply!

PRESENTATION OF THE ALBERT SCHWEITZER MEDAL
OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

at the

CONNAUGHT 'HOTEL, LONDON, W.l.
on
Friday, 12th October, 1956.

Major C. W. Hume founded the University of London Animal Welfare
Society some 25 odd years ago. It has grown from a tiny organisation whose
first lecture attracted an audience of two , to become the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare with branches in all British Universities
and a well—staffed London Headquarters. Its objective has always been
the same; to reduce the amount of fear and pain inflicted upon animals
by man, Major Hume has dedicated his life with complete uns elfishness
to advanCing that aim. Not only has he been unselfish, he has been
extraordinarily tireless, imaginative and courageous in attacking the most
difficult animal protective problems. Never once has he sacrificed the
interest of suffering animals to an easy acceptance of the status quo or the
taking of a pOpular position when it was an unpopular one that would help
the animals.

U.F .A.W . , of which he is director, has devoted its work especially
to the animals that are used by man for food, fur, experimental and other
purposes. These are the animals whose sufferings are rarely seen by the
vast majority of peOple. They are also the animals on which the impact
of modern science has the greatest effect both for helping and for hurting.
For example, U.F .A.W . has devoted much effort to the development of
humane methods of killing such animals as are currently killed with great
cruelty. Whales, which suffer long torment after an explosive harpoon
has entered their bodies, rabbits which are caught in gin traps - ”diabolical
instruments” as they have been called in a report by a Committee of
Parliament; rats which die slowly and painfully through poisons , and many
others. It is hoped that scientific knowledge can help these animals, and
U .F .A.W . - supported studies are underway in all these fields.

Laboratory animals by the nature of things suffer more than they
benefit from scientific enquiry. Nevertheless, U.F.A.W., by working
with humane minded scientists and inspiring others to efforts of their own,
has helped these animals enormously.

”The U.F .A.W . Handbook on the Care and Management of Labor-
atory Animals” (1947) is a classic. A new edition with a wealth of new
material testifying to the growth of interest in these animals is eXpected
to be in the hands of the booksellers by the first of the year. U.F.A.W . .
is currently at work in encouraging the deveIOpm ent and use of new
humane techniques in the laboratory.

 




In the United States no organisation comparable to U.F .A.W .
existed until 1951 when the Animal Welfare Institute, 270, Park Avenue,
New York City, was founded. Like U.F.A.W . it refuses to take part
in the anti- and pro-vivisection debate but devotes itself directly to
the interests of the animals used for experimental purposes. Its work
to protect animals in slaughter-hous es is on the same basis; it does not
seek to advocate vegetarianism but to help the millions of animals being
killed by getting rid. of cruel methods of slaughter and substituting
humane ones.

The A. W.I. , was founded by Christine Stevens (Mrs. Roger) .
She was urged to do so by the four largest American animal protective
societies because they felt unequipped to deal with the explosive subject
of laboratory animal welfare. Immediately on its formation the A. W. I.
was attacked from both sides, the anti-vivisection societies and the
medical research societies, with virulence.

Theseattacks have continued but considerable progress has been
made despite them. Hundreds of laboratories located in nearly every
State in the Union, as well as countries in EurOpe, Asia and South America,
have requested copies of the Institute's publication ”Basic Care of
EXperimental Animals" and ”Comfortable Quarters for Laboratory
Animals” which give practical information on how to provide properly for
these animals. This year, a film ”Handling Laboratory Animals"
produced by MacQueen Films in co~0peration with the National Institute
of Medical Research at Mill Hill has been widely shown in American
laboratories through the agency of the A.W. I.

To advance the humane education of children, the A.W.I. has
attributed free to teachers its manual ”First Aid and care of small Animals"
which has been received enthusiastically by educators. It is waging a
continuing battle against cruel exPeriments on animals in schools. It
deplores the induction of cancer in mice and chicks before the eyes of
immature youths. Children's eXperiments involving the starving of
white rats to demonstrate the results of poor diet is the most common of
these demoralizing educational methods against which the A.W.I. is
fighting.

In order to encourage kindness to laboratory animals and to reduce
the number of cruel and unnecessary exPeriments, the Albert Schweitzer
award of the A.W. I. was initiated. Dr. Schweitzer's noble concept of
Reverence for Life has been embodied in a medal which shows the great
phiIOSOpher and medical missionary, seated at a table with his dog. His
words ”We need a boundless, ethics which will include the animals also"
are inscribed on the medal. Dr. Schweitzer who has encouraged the
work of the A.W.I. received a gold replica of the medal in 1954. In
1955, the first award of a bronze medal and S 500 was made to Dr.
Robert Bay, a humane vetinarian in charge of a colony of eXperimental
dogs which he treated with outstanding care and Consideration and
protected against unnecessary or severe suffering. In 1955).

 




 

it is being awarded to Major Hume, Director of U.F.A.W ., at a ceremony
to be held on October 12th, at the Connaught Hotel, London. Laboratory
animals in the United States as well as Britain, owe much to Major Hume.
During the period in which the A. W. l. was being organised some of the
publications of U.F .A.W . were shown to its future officers. Voluminous
correspondence resulted which has been highly beneficial to the young
Institute.

There is no law in the United States such as there is in Great Britain
to protect laboratory animals from cruelty. Thus the work of the A. W. I.
in trying to protect these animals is truly gargantuan. Its only weapon
against extreme propogandists on both sides of the debate is to tell the
exact truth about conditions in the laboratories visited by its represent-
atives, and to distribute the facts widely. For its pains, it has recently
been compared with Hitler, Stalin and Machiavelli by the National Society
for Medical Research. Nevertheless, its officers believe that in due course
the careful planning of experiments with animals which result from the
British Act regulating them, the careful selection in training to which .
British Animal Technicians are subjected, to take proper care of laboratory
animals , and the interest in developing the best methods of husbandry and
of humane techniques must receive world wide recognition. If this
happens, U.F.A.W. and especially its Director, Major Hume, will deserve
much of the credit. ‘

Major Charles Westley Hume

Major Charles Westley Hume, M. C. , Director, Universities
Federation of Anhnal Welfare Society, was a senior examiner in the
Patent Office. " Now in private patent practice. Has the unusual
distinction of being an honorary citizen of Meurchin, Pas de Calais,
since 1953. Was educated at Christ's College, Finchley, Strand
School and Birkbeck College (University of London). Served in the
1914—1918 war, first in the Signal Section of the Royal Engineers and
later in the Royal Corps of Signals. He is a member of many learned
societies and his club is the Athenaeum . He was Honorary Secretary
of British Science Guild and editor to the Physical Society 1919-1940.
Major Hume has written numerous articles on animal welfare, statistics,
statistical analysis, religion, patent law and rabbit control. His
address is 284 Regents Park Road, Finchley, N. 3.

Parliament; rats which die slowly and painfully through poisons , and many
others. It is hoped that scientific knowledge can help these animals, and
U .F .A.W . - supported studies are underway in all these fields.

Laboratory animals by the nature of things suffer more than they
benefit from scientific enquiry. Nevertheless, U.F.A..W.. , by working
with humane minded scientists and inspiring others to efforts of their own,
has helped these animals enormously.

”The U.F .A.W . Handbook on the Care and Management of Labor-
atory Animals” (1947) is a classic. A new edition with a wealth of new
material testifying to the growth of interest in these animals is expected
‘to be in the hands of the booksellers by the first of the year. U.F.A.W . n,
is currently at work in encouraging the deveIOpm ent and use of new
humane techniques in the laboratory.

 




In the United States no organisation comparable to U.F.A.W .
existed until 1951 when the Animal Welfare Institute, 270, Park Avenue,
New York City, was founded. Like U.F.A.W . it refuses to take part
in the anti- and pro-vivisection debate but devotes itself directly to
the interests of the animals used for eXperimental purposes. Its work
to protect animals in slaughter-houses is on the same basis; it does not
seek to advocate vegetarianism but to help the millions of animals being
killed by getting rid. of cruel methods of slaughter and substituting
humane ones .

The A. W. I. , was founded by Christine Stevens (Mrs. Roger) .
She was urged to do so by the four largest American animal protective
societies because they felt unequipped to deal with the exPlosive subject
of laboratory animal welfare. Immediately on its formation the A. W. I.
was attacked from both sides, the anti—vivisection societies and the
medical research societies, with virulence.

Theseattacks have continued but considerable progress has been
made despite them. Hundreds of laboratories located in nearly every
State in the Union, as well as countries in EurOpe, Asia. and South America,
have requested copies of the Institute's publication ”Basic Care of
Experimental Animals” and ”Comfortable Quarters for Laboratory
Animals” which give practical information on how to provide properly for
these'animals. This year, a film ”Handling Laboratory Animals"
produced by MacQueen Films in co-operation with the National Institute
of Medical Research at Mill Hill has been widely shown in American

laboratories through the agency of the A.W. I.

To advance the humane education of children, the A.W.I. has
attributed free to teachers its manual "First Aid and care of small Animals”
which has been received enthusiastically by educators. It is waging a
continuing battle against cruel eXperiments on animals in schools. It
deplores the induction of cancer in mice and chicks before the eyes of
immature youths. Children's eXperiments involving the starving of
white rats to demonstrate the results of poor diet is the most common of
these demoralizing educational methods against which the A.W. I. is
fighting.

the number of cruel and unnecessary eXperiments, the Albert Schweitzer

phi1030pher and medical missionary, seated at a table with his dog. His
words “We need a boundless ethics which will include the animals also”
are inscribed on the medal. Dr. Schweitzer who has encouraged the
work of the A. W.I. received a gold replica of the medal in 1954. In
1955, the first award of a bronze medal and $ 500 was made to Dr.
Robert Bay, a humane vetinarian in charge of a colony of exPerimental
dogs which he treated with outstanding care and Consideration and
protected against unnecessary or severe suffering. In 195.6.

There is no law in the United States such as there is in Great Britain
to protect laboratory animals from cruelty. Thus the work of the A. W. I.
in trying to protect these animals is truly gargantuan. Its only weapon

exact truth about conditions in the laboratories visited by its represent-
atives, and to distribute the facts widely. For its pains, it has recently
been compared with Hitler, Stalin and Machiavelli by the National Society .

the careful planning of eXperiments with animals which result from the
3-3ritishAct regulating them, the careful selection in training to which .
British Animal Technicians are subjected, to take proper care of laboratory
animals, and the interest in developing the best methods of husbandry and
of humane techniques must receive world wide recognition. If this
happens, U.F.A.W . and eSpecially its Director, Major Hume, will deserve
much of the credit.

Background Information

PRESENTATION OF THE ALBERT SCHWEITZER MEDAL
OF THE ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

at the

CONNAUGHT HOTEL, LONDON, w.1.
on
Friday, 12th October, 1956.

Major C. W. Hume founded the University of London Animal Welfare
Society some 25 odd years ago. It has grown from a tiny organisation whose
first lecture attracted an audience of two . to become the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare with branches in all British Universities
and a well-staffed London Headquarters. Its obj ective has always been
the same; to reduce the amount of fear and pain inflicted upon animals
by man, Major Hume has dedicated his life with complete uns elfishness
to advancing that aim. Not only has he been unselfish, he has been
extraordinarily tireless, imaginative and courageous in attacking the most
difficult animal protective problems . Never once has he sacrificed the
interest of suffering animals to an easy acceptance of the status quo or the
taking of a popular position when it was an unpopular one that would help
the animals.

U.F.A.W ., of which he is director, has devoted its work especially
to the animals that are used by man for food, fur, eXperimental and other
purposes. These are the animals whose sufferings are rarely seen by the
vast majority of peOple. They are also the animals on which the impact
of modern science has the greatest effect both for helping and for hurting.
For example, U.F .A.W . has devoted much effort to the deve10pment Of
humane methods Of'killing such animals as are currently killed with great
cruelty. Whales, which suffer long torment after an eXplosive harpoon
has entered their bodies, rabbits which are caught in gin traps - ”diabolical
instruments” as they have been called in a report by a Committee of
Parliament; rats which die slowly and painfully through poisons , and many
others. It is hoped that scientific knowledge can help these animals , and
U .F ..A.W . - supported studies are underway in all these fields .

Laboratory animals by the nature of things suffer more than they
benefit from scientific enquiry. Nevertheless, U.F.A.W ., by working
with humane minded scientists and inSpiring others to efforts Of their own,
has helped these animals enormously.

”The U.F .A.W . Handbook on the Care and Management of Labor-

Speech of N s. Christine Stevens in presenting the Schweitzer

Medal to Major C. M'. Hume on behalf of the Animal Melfare Institute

 

 

Major Hume recognized before anyone else the extraordinary close
relationship which was bound to come between science on the massive
modern scale and the welfare of animals. H mving recognized it, he

acts d upon it in a wide variety of w1ys from the most minutely technical

to the most broadly ethical.

With the help of all of you.who: :zre here toni1¢ ght and the other
humane and thoughtful people who she1re his convictions, he has built
the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare into a strong force
against cruelty, callousness and suffering. He has deprived the
opponents of animal protection of their favorite emmun1tion by providing
e reasoned and learned approach to the reduction f cruelty. He has
lessened suffering by applying this approech to specific problems. He
1aa exerc ed,v1soom on selectinw from the discouribingly vast array of
difficult problems those which cs use the most severe sufk ng o the
largest number of animals. He has sought total solutions without
rejecting partial ones when they help animals.

These are only a few of the reasons why Major Hume has been asked
to accept the Albe rt Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute.

0

It was created for the purpose reducing the pain and fear thet men

inflict on nin ls, esp mtly labors Htory nimais. No one could be

more deserving of this 51m .rd then.M jor Hume. The brilliance of his mind,

the wide range of his interest and knowledge, his deep concern with

ethics, and, above all, his real and dire ct sympathy with animals leads

to an obvious snelogy with Dr. Schweitzer. Different though their

lives he Ne been, bo+ h exemplify a spi irit which is gaining ground Both

have greet respect for the scientific method and the knowleds e it makes

Both are active in putting such knowledge to work for direct

u: feriq” ores tures whether they are pelicens or rats, rabbits or

humans. Both have written lucidly and beautifully on moral Questions.

M1ajor Hume hes made substantial contributions towards the goal of

/Consd.

 




Dr. Schweitzer's plea for "a broader ettri which will include the
animsls 3150". Such 3 point of view is no longer an unnecessary
refinement of civilization. The advancement of scientific knowledge
it imperative for us in the twentieth century to develop

sympathy and consideration and kindness as never before for the most
basic of ell res sons - survival of ourselves and of the earth itself
as We know it.

It he 3 been s3 3id that human beings usually end up treating each
other as they have treated ”him ls. If this is true, and there
is considm eble historic e-l evidence to show that it is, Mejor Hume's
unflegging efforts in behalf of one of the most unpopular animals in
the world should. be soureci ted by millions. I :13 th t
which is n a " 3 3 eat ble, and when kindly treated,
friendly animal, is depicted on the Schweitzer Med.: 1 togethazr with

cat and monkey, guinea pig, ,igeon and chick. Major Hume

has chem oioned the rifht of rats to humane considerations He has
striven against that s3d illOé j‘ic which s1: sts that 01311 {e of an
animal gives one the right to make it suffer and that if an animal
is to be killed it makes no difference whet torment it goes through
in the proces .

For his unselfish devotion to the protection of all kinds of

enime s popular and unpopular eeein t unnecesssry suffering, for

his courage and 33rd work, lmelnatlon and good sense in carrying

out the ere3t aim of reducing the pain end fear we inflict, the

Albert Schvm Mt er Medal is presented to Major Hume,

Msjor C” W. Hume founded the Universitg of london Animal Welfare Society
some 25 odd Jeers ego. It has grown from s tiny organisation shoes first
lecture attracted an audience of two, to become the Universities
Federation for Animal Welfare with brsnohes in ell British Universities
end a well—stnffed london Headquarters. Its objective has always been
sis-m the some; to reduce the amount of fear and pain inflicted upon
animals by men.a-d Major Hume hes dedioeted his life with oomplete
unselfishness to sdvnnoing thst sin. Not only has he been unselfish,

he has been extreordinsrily tireless, imaginative end courageous

in ettsoking the most difficult animal protective problems. Never once
has he ssoﬁfioed the interest of suffering snimsls to on easy acceptance
of the ststus one or the taking of s poouler position when it see an
unhapulsr one thst would help the enimels.

U.F.A.W, of which he is‘ﬁireotor, has devoted its work especislly
to the animals that are used by men for food, for, exterimentsl '

end other purposes. These ere the animals whose sufferings are rarely
seen by thesvsst majority of people. They are also the enimels on
which the inpeot of modern science has the greatest effect both for
helping and for hurting. For example, U.F.A.W. has devoted much effort
to the develoynent of humnns methods of killing such animals es ere
currently hilled with greet cruelty. Wheles,whioh suffer 3 long
torment after on explosive herpoon has entered their b dies, rabbits
which re caught in gin trans — "diabolical instruments"ares they have
been celled in a report by s Committee of Pnrlisment; rats which dis
slowly end painfully through poisons,snd many others. It is hoped that
scientific knowledge sen help these animals end U.F.A.W. ~ onshorted
studies are underway in ell these fields.

laboratory enimsls by the nature of things suffer more then they
benefit from scientific enquiry. Nevertheless, U.F.AJJ by working with
humans minded scientists snu inspiring others to efforts of their own,
has helped these enimnls enormously.

"The U.F.A.W. Hendbook on the Cere end Menagement of laboratory Animals"
(1947) is n olessio. A new edition with a wealth of new material
testifying to the growth of interest in these snimsls is exnected to
be in the hands of the booksellers by the let of the yeer. U.F.4.W.,is
currently st work in encoursging the dove onment end use of neW'humsne
techniques in the leboretory.

In the Urg%3%b organisation oompersble to U.F.A.W. existed until 1951
when the Animal welfare Institute, 270, Park Avenue, Nee York City, was
founded. like U.F.A. W. it refuses to take part in the enti~ end prou
vivissotion debate but devotes itself directly to the interests of the
animals used for sxnsrimsntsl purposes. Its work to protect snimsls

in sleughter houses is on the sum besis; it does not seen to

edvooste vegeterisnism but to hel millions of snimels being killed

by getting rid of cruel methods of slaughter and substituting humans

Ones.

The A.W.I., was founded by Christine Stevens (srs.sogsr). Shs was
urged to do so by tho four lsrgost American ﬁnimsl {rotsotivs
Eociotios because they felt unsouippsd to deal with tho orplosivo
subject of Laboratory inimsl Wolfsro. Immodistsly on its formation
th A.W.I. was attacked from both sides, the sntiuvivisoction Societies

These attacks have continued but considerable progress hss boon

In order to encourage kindness to laboratory snimsls and to roducs tho

air, tirelessly, endlessly, Speaking to and for practitioners
of medicine, those ultimate guardians of the public health.”
The award, comprising a plaque and a gold medal, was pre-
sented to Dr. Fishbein on September 28 by the president of
the association, Dr. RICHARD M. HEWITT, of the Mayo Clinic,
who worked for many years with Dr. Fishbein— as assistant
editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Lord Nufﬁeld’s Gift to Faculty of Dental Surgery—At a
lunch at the Royal College of Surgeons on October 12 Lord
NUFFIELD gave a cheque for £100,000 to ethe dean of the
faculty of dental surgery, Professor F. C. WILKINSON, to
establish a chair of dental research in the new department of
dental science at the College. Lord Nuﬂield’s gift will pro-
vide the salary and expenses in perpetuity of a research pro»-
fessor who.will also act as director of the department, which
will, in close contact with the Institute of Basic Medical
Sciences of the College, explore the fundamental problems of
dental disease. It is hoped that the department may become
a scientiﬁc centre not only for workers from this country but
also for those from. the Commonwealth. When Lord
Nuﬂield decided to endow the research chair the appeal for
funds for a new department had reached the halfway house.
It had been given an excellent start by the Leverhulme Trust,
which had assumed initial responsibility for the salaries of
the scientiﬁc Staff who will work under the Nuﬂield professor.
Professor Wilkinson, thanking. Lord Nufﬁeld for his gift, said
that future generations would wonder that one man could
have done so much to foster the advancement of medicine
in so many ﬁelds.

Harveian Oration.—Professor J. CRIGHTON BRAMWELL,
formerly professor of cardiology and now emeritus professor
at Manchester University, delivered this year’s Harveian
Oration at the Royal College of Physicians of London on
October 18. His subject was “Practice, Teaching, and Re-
search.”
and clinician, he said. The good teacher must have the
spirit of an investigator—the powers of observation and
deduction combined with the faculty of curiosity—although
for teaching future practitioners clinical experience was more
important than executive ability in research. Preclinical
teachers should cultivate in their students the scientiﬁc atti-
tude of mind and show them how to apply scientiﬁc methods
to the solution of clinical problems. The rapid advance of
medical knowledge had made specialization inevitable, con-
tinued Professor Bramwell ; but the specialist whose, ﬁeld of
vision was limited to his own specialty saw illness through
tinted glasses. The specialist ought to be a general physician
or surgeon who had added to his knowledge of general
medicine a more profound study of one of the specialties.

The fundamental unity of medicine could not be over-l

emphasized.

Leverhulme Research Awards, .1957.—Application is in-
vited for fellowships and grants in aid of research. These
awards are intended for senior workers of established posi-
tion and are limited to British—born subjects normally resi~
dent in the United Kingdom; in exceptional circumstances
the Trustees may waive the condition as to residence. No

subject of inquiry is excluded from consideration, but prefer:
ence is given to subjects in which existing provision joy"

research is inadequate. The duration of the awards does
not extend over more than two years- or less than three
months, and the amount depends on the nature of the re-
search and the circumstances of the applicant. Application
forms are obtainable from the secretary, Leverhulme. Re-
search Awards, St. Bridget’s House, Bridewell Place, London,
E.C.4. The closing date is December 31. Results will be
announced in May and the awards will normally date from
September 1, 1957.

arranged a trial in convict volunteers, and is stated to have
enough vaccine to inoculate nearly two million people. The
vaccine is given orally. Last year. we published a paper by
Dr. Sabin describing the results of a trial of an attenuated

Glasgow Library.——The Wellcome Trust has agreed to
grant £500 a year for ﬁVe years for repairing the historical
books in the library of the Royal Faculty of Physicians and
Surgeons of Glasgow. The library was instituted in 1697,
when the Faculty ﬁrst obtained premises almost 100 years
after its foundation by a grant from King James. VI‘ to
Maister Peter Lowe. It now consists of some 150,000
volumes, more than 4,000 of them published before 1700.
Many of these are of extreme rarity and some are unique.
The preservation of this collection for the use of the medical
profession not only in Glasgow but, by a system of inter-
library loans, throughout the country has become a ﬁnancial
problem for the Faculty, and this gift will enable many of
the older books to be repaired.

, Convalescent Treatment under N.H.S.—The MINISTER OF
HEALTH has appointed a working party with the following
: “ To examine the extent to which the

Service is meeting the demands placed upon it in the light

LE GROS CLARK, F.R.S., professor of anatomy at Oxford.
He will lecture on the anatomical basis of olfactory discrim-
ination. Both lectures are at 4.30 pm. ‘

Royal College of Surgeons—At a council meeting on
October 11 the president, Sir HARRY PLATT, presented the
Walker prize to Dr. C. P. RHOADS, of New York, whose
Imperial Cancer Research Fund lecture is summarized else-
where in this issue (p. 935). The Cecil Joll prize for 1956
was awarded to Professor P. R. ALLISON, of Oxford, for his
contributions to thoracic surgery.

Leader for Antarctic Expedition.——-The War Ofﬁce has
agreed to the appointment of Colonel R. A. SMART, late
R.A.M.C., "deputy director of Army Health, Western Com-
mand, as leader of the main party of the Royal Society
