as I do fish and fish do other fish and
the plants of our waters, but they do
not torture me or insist I ”believe" in
them, they do not kill for sake of the

millions of years ago to make his home
and have his life in me and with me and
-I love to wash over his great flank, he
giVes me joy and life...but if you, man,
dump factory and atomic waste in me I too
shall live your polluted way and be as
you are, full of death, and die, and Orca
will die as you die." -

NORTH CAROLlNAJBAPPEBS
North Carolina Trappers—they're our men
Who continue a heritage
From way back when.
They're up early in the morning
. Checking their traps.
“Til late in the evening —-
No afternoon“ naps.
At night they're out working
Skinning their cats.
Foxes. beavers, coons, and muskrats.

One day he‘ll come in -
Shaking his head.
"Nothing today —-—
Just a ‘possum instead.
But tomorrow's rewards
Will be better. l'm sure
’Cause l moved‘the traps
And put out some lure.“
Sometimes we wives wonder
Just how we will stand it
‘Tll the season is over
But then we are handed
The money they made
While we‘re sitting here yapping
And once again we say ‘
“Thank goodness lor trapping!”
Deborah Carpenter. Anson County

Why Nobody Pets the Lion at the Zoo

The morning that the world began
The Lion growled a growl at Man.

And I suspect the Lion might _»
(If he’d been closer) have tried a bite.

I think that’s as it ought to be
And not as it was taught to me.

I think the Lion has a right
To growl a growl and bite a bite.

And if the Lion bothered Adam,
He should have growled right back at ’im.

~—

The way to treat a Lion right
Is growl for growl and bite for bite.

True, the Lion is better fit
For biting than for being bit.

But if you look him in the eye
You’ll find the Lion’s rather shy.

He really wants someone to pet him.
The trouble is: his teeth won’t let him.

He has a heart of gold beneath
But the Lion just can’t trust his teeth.

TWELFTH NIGHT: SONG OF TH CAMELS

Not born to the forest are we,

Not born to the plain,

To the grass and the shadowing tree
And the Splashing of rain.

Only the sand we know

And the cloudless sky.

The mirage and the deep—sunk well
And the stars on high.

To the sound of our bells we came
With huge soft stride,

Kings riding upon our backs,
Slaves at our side.

Out of the east drawn on

By a dream and a star,

Seeking the hills and the groves
Where the ﬁxed towns are.

Our goal was no palace gate,

No temple of old,

But a child on his mother’s lap
In the cloudy cold.

The olives were windy and white,
Dust swirled through the town,
As all in their royal robes

Our masters knelt down.

The Night Vet

After hours, on weekends and holidays

an aquamarine sign goes on at the corner

of Constance and De La Vina streets,
"Emergency Pet Clinic." One by one

they come, parking in the finance company lot
and carrying an animal towards the green glow.
Like a mender of broken toys, _
the pet doctor has seen everything.

As the night gets deeper

the cages, big and small, fill.

A bird treated for asthma stops wheezing
and chirps at the hospital lighting.

Two dogs and a puppy, hit by cars,

move in the white sleep of slowly
dissolving anesthesia. One cat

with a hairball stuck in his stomach
awaits surgery with open black eyes.

The soul of this place is in its sounds:
the phone, urgent and empty

without day noises; the squishy

radiology apron; a dissonance of scissors
in a metal pan. The puppy wakes up and
whines steadily until morning. It is then
that owners reappear to meet the doctor.
He calls the pets by name, handing them
back with all the hope of a Noah,

the flood over and the ark unloading.

THEMADYAK /

I am watching them churn the last mill:
they’ll ever get from me. '
They are waiting for me to die; @
They want to make buttons out of my bones. \
Where are my sisters and brothers?
That tall monk there, loading my uncle,
he has a new cap.
And that idiot student of his—
I never saw that mufﬂer before.
Poor uncle, he lets them load him.
How sad he is, how tired!
I wonder what they’ll do with his bones?
And that beautiful tail!
How many shoelace: will they make . int!

ON THE WALLS
OF A DULL FURNISHED ROOM . . .

I hang old photos of my childhood girls—
With breaking heart I sit, elbow on table,
Chin on hand, studying

the proud eyes of Helen,

the weak mouth of Jane,

the golden hair of Susan.

ITALIAN EXTRAVACANZA

Mrs. Lombardi’s month-old son is dead.
I saw it in Rizzo’s funeral parlor,

A small purplish wrinkled head.

They’ve just ﬁnished having high mass for it;
They’re coming out now

...wow, such a small coﬁnl

And ten black cadillacs to haul it in.

THE HARVEST

Immersed . . .

tangled brush of

a slash slope

Gathering serviceberries,
cool mountain dampness
of day's end

Pretending to be a bear
(brown wool sweater!) . . .

How would it feel to be shot there,
fist full of plump purple berries,
mouth full of sweetness?

Crumpled suddenly into the bush,
staring through blurred branches

into approaching night;

bewildered, hearing voices and footfalls
crashing through the thicket;

not understanding what a rifle is-—

nor this searing, violent death.

 




Daughters with Toad

Unblinking thing, as absolute as clay.
Fumed from the dank by my mower's snarl, he muses.
Vv dauahters find him, and their squeals propel,

I
.

bounce him from his mope,.ringing him with glee.

With sly. leary touch they probe his arathy .
unearthed-—half-thrown, with lurching, bloated thump
he falls. They toy and stroke, forgive his piss,

his pebbled hide, coo to his bulbous stare.

Squat in their palms, he thrills them with his pulse.
They lean near, enraptured by his ugliness,

wild hair burnished down round him in bright waves.
And they whisper, foreheads almost touching.

Then each brings her lips to meet that grim crack
of torpid mouth. They return him to grass '
to await the kisses’transformation.-

Nothing. The pale throat only swells the air

and flutters, emits one pathetic croak.

They laugh, and to the toad, their teeth so fine
must gleam like the teeth of little foxes.
Uneaten, he ponders on, abandoned.

My daughters are not sad. The day will be
husband enough, obedient to whim--

a royal ball. They waltz toward lunchtime,
assuring me he spoke to them in prince.

The Heaven of Animals

Here they are. The soft eyes open.
If they have lived in a wood

It is a wood.

If they have lived on plains

It is grass rolling

Under their feet forever.

Having no souls, they have come,
Anyway, beyond their knowing.
Their instincts wholly bloom
And they rise.

The soft eyes Open.

To match them, the landscape ﬂowers,
Outdoing, desperately

Outdoing what is required:

The richest Wood,

The deepest ﬁeld.

For some of these,

It could not be the place

It is, without blood.

These hunt, as they have done,

But with claws and teeth grown perfect,

More deadly than they can believe.
They stalk more silently,

And crouch on the limbs of trees,
And their descent

Upon the bright backs of their prey

May take years

In a sovereign ﬂoating of joy.
And those that are hunted
Know this as their life,

Their reward: to Walk

 

 




 

Under such trees in full knowledge
Of what is in glory above them,
And to feel no fear,

But acceptance, compliance.
Fulﬁlling themselves without pain

At the cycle’s center,

They tremble, they walk
Under the tree,

They fall, they are torn,
They rise, they walk again.

FORGIVENESS

The torturer removes a fingernail:
No forgiveness for him.
An old Nazi softens, laments:
No, put him to death.
He who hates:
Give him a mirror and a gun.
He who hates in the singular:
Forgive him, once.
The crimes of lovers:
Forgive them later, as soon as you can.
Anyone who hurts someone you love:
Saints, you forgivers,
we could never be friends.
The betrayer, the liar, the thief:

Forgive anything you might do yourself.

The terrorist pulls a pin;
Forgive the desperate, the homeless,
the crazed.

The terrorist pulls a pin;

No, no more good reasons.

The rat in my crawlspace, the vicious rat:
No forgiveness necessary.

I, who put out the poison;
God of rats, forgive me once again.
