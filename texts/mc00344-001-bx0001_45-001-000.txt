In the mornings, as shrimp
boats trawl across the horizon and
light filters through the gnarled live
oaks, the usual morning sounds of
the Georgia coast are interspersed
with the screech of red-fronted ma-
ca'ws from South America, the call
of wattled cranes from Southern Af-
rica and the gentle clucking of le-
murs from the Madagascar rain for-
est . ‘
~ The four zoologists who staff the
breeding center could take long
walks along empty beaches or v151t
the burial site of James Ogle-
thorpe’s Indian translator, but there
is little time for reflection or beach-

combing.

f‘James Murtaugh, a mammal
specialist who directs the breeding
program, says the days are devoted
to the nuts and bolts of practical zo-
ologl’, all done on an annual budget
of 3300;000. .

:“ﬁth foreign countries less and
less willing to part with rare ani-
mals — and with the animals them-
selves becoming rarer — zoos are
increasingly dependent on their own
resources to restock empty cages.
Sometimes, the animals can be bred
in the zoos themselves. When they
can’t, they are often sent to St.
Catherines. ’

’Ilesses Seal, a captive breeding
speCialist with the International Un-
ion for the Conservation of Nature,
says the island has several advan-
tages over most zoos when it comes
to breeding - lots of space, a mild
subtropical climate and no gaping
crowds.

g The ring-tailed lemurs being
kept in an old grape arbor are a
good example of what a stay on St
Catherines can do. Born in the
Bronx Zoo, the lemurs - which
look like sleek, athletic raccoons - a
were "culturally deprived” when
they arrived, overweight from zoo

food and suffering from too little _

exercise.

0“"‘They had no idea how to sur-
vi_e," says Murtaugh. “They’d fall
out of trees holding onto dead
branches they couldn’t distinguish
from live ones.”

But the lemurs learned quickly.
Today they forage for much of their
food and climb with agility. Two
are believed to be pregnant, and
Murtaugh says the next generation

will probably be set free in a wild- .'

life; preserve similar to their disap-
pearing habitat on Madagascar.

_:'The lemur isn’t the only endan-
gered species on St. Catherines
making its way slowly back to na-
ture. Florida sandhill cranes, extinct
for years in Georgia, now roam
freely on one corner of the island.
Bird specialist Al Valezuela started
several years ago with eggs taken
froinrnests in Florida and two
breeding pairs of cranes. He now
has a flock of 14 mature cranes,
which he hopes will slowly repopu- 2
late Georgia’s sea islands.

‘This fall zoologists hope to in- ,
troduce gopher tortoises and indigo -’
snakes, "which also were once com-
mob in Georgia and the Southeast.

‘Under the best of circum- .
stances, however, the effort to aid .
endangered species is “a drop in the ’
bucket,” says Murtaugh, something
he says was underscored to him by i
an incident in 1984. ?

After years of breeding Dama ‘
gazelles in captivity, Murtaugh said,
the-program had a big enough herd
to be able to send three animals to

a newly .opened national wildlife
preserve in Libya.

 

Soon after the gazelles were
sent, however, the St. Catherines zo-
ologists learned that Libya’s army
had slaughtered one of the few re-
maining wild herds of gazelles. “It’s
enough to make a pessimist out of
you,” says Murtaugh, watching the
herd of tiny, deerlike animals bolt 2
across a grassy field.

:With more than 340 rare birds.
,mar’nmals and tortoises to care for,
the. St. Catherines zoologists spend
most of their time preparing food
for‘animals that need it, watching
for;signs of illness and recording
their diet, behavior and births.

Sometimes, however, the care
and breeding of endangered species
demand special insight or interven-
tion.

When the program was sent a
herd of Jackson’s hartebeests, for
example, Murtaugh knew he had a
problem because the animals had a
history of goring each other. After
weeks of watching the brown, horse-
like creatures graze, he noticed that
violence only erupted between
males and their female offspring.
The problem disappeared when the
young females were separated from
the herd.

Iadorosa discovered a solution
to tortoises’ natural lethargy, which
sometimes deters them from breed-
ing. He found that giving the tor-
toises a chunk or two of watermel-

on along with their normal diet

affreally turns them on.”

i And then there are the crane
dances.

Although he believes that diet is
the prime factor in successful
breeding, bird specialist Valezuela
is not above taking unusual meas-
ures. to make sure his feathered
friends are in the right mood for
breeding. '

‘fYou can use Special lights. A
lot of times,'you make male calls
and that helps,” he says.

“Or,,with a crane, you can
dance. There are these unique steps,
almost-like a ballet, that the birds
do in the wild. You do that for
thermand it gets the'7 real excited.
They gz: crazy. ”g

SCIENCE NOTEBOOK

 

 

land Aquarium - “fixtures,
aquatic equipment and the inhabitants
of the 47 exhibits” - will soon be
moved from Gordon Park location to
Metroparks Zoo.

I received this information with a
mixture of relief and disappointment.
It was good news that once again
Greater Cleveland will have a signifi-
cant display of water creatures, but I
would have preferred that it remain in
Gordon Park.

The aquarium used to be one of my
favorite stOps, especially with out-of-
town visitors. The exhibits were good,
and a visit did not require an entire
day. The facility was large enough to
provide a satisfying variety of looking
and learning experiences, but it could
be done in an hour or two of leisurely
browsing.

I have been associated with aquari-
ums, actively and passively, for a long
time. When my sons were small and
we spent our summers at the shore on
North Carolina’s Outer Banks, I used
to construct an impromptu display
from a bucket and the tiny creatures I
could gather at surf’s edge.

These included coquinas (tiny, mul-
ticolored bivalves), mole crabs (which
look a bit like the wood lice to be
found by overturning rotten logs) and
assorted small fish which could be
netted in the surf. With some sea
water and the bottom of the bucket
covered by a layer of sand for the
coquinas and mole crabs to burrow in,
this setup could entertain a small per-
son for many engrossing minutes.

Of course, these experiences led to
a succession of home-based aquari-
ums populated by various freshwater,
tropical fish.

The all-time favorite “home”
aquarium resulted when we loaded up

Apes Can Call
Jungle Their Home

By Deborah Peterson
01 the Post-Dispatch Staff

The suspense is over. The new
ape house at the St. Louis 200
will be called “Jungle of the
Apes.”

But the contest is not over yet.
Seventeen people entered that
name as the best choice for the
new $3 million ape house. And
now, a run-off of sorts will be
held to pick the first-, second-
and third place winners.

The 17 have been asked to
write essays of 25 words or less
explaining Why they think “Jun-

gle of the Apes,"
is the most appropriate name for the
new development. .

The essays will be judged by Janine
Grossman, manager of promotions
and public relations for the Post-Dis-
patch; Joan Quicksilver of IQ & Asso-
ciates, an advertising and public rela-
tions firm in Clayton; and Judy Sims,
public affairs director for KMOX
Radio. '

“Jungle of the Apes” was chosen by
six other judges from 15,548 entries.
The contest is being sponsored by the
Post-Dispatch and KMOX Radio.

The winning entrants have been
notified by mailgrams and telephone
calls that they should send their es:
says to the judges by Tuesday, Quick-
silver said. She said the judges would
make their final selections Tuesday
or Wednesday.

The most entries - 22 —— were sub-
mitted with the name “The Great Ape
Escape,” but the judges were not
swayed by popularity, Quicksilver
said. The judges also turned down
such pun-wise names as “Perkins In-
ternational House of Primates” and
“The Muny Apera.”

Quicksilver said the judges “want-
ed a name that was befitting this fa-
cility, that justified the stature of the
building and the magnificence of it.”

The new ape home is expected to
open in May. It will feature a domed
circular building filled with greenery
that will create the atmosphere of a
tropical rain forest. '

The contest’s grand-prize winner
will get a five-day trip for four to the
Dark Continent at Busch Gardens in
Tampa, Fla. Travel arrangements
and ground accommodations are be-
ing provided by Ozark Air Lines.

Second prize is a VIP tour of the
Zoo, including a preview of the new
ape area and lunch with Charlie
Hoessle, Zoo director. Third prize is a
$100 gift certificate for the Zoo gift
shop. .

The contest directors have decided
to award a runner-up prize of $25 gift
certificates to the 200 gift shop for
each of the 14 non-winners who
picked the “Jungle of the Apes”
name, Quicksilver said.

The rangers have spread an intel-
ligence network through the surround-
ing villages in the hope of hearing
when a poaching party enters. Today’s
batch was pursued and caught after a
tip-off.

The poachers had expensive-look-
ing, fur-lined nylon jackets and water-
proof rations of food, reﬂecting the
lucrativeness of their work.

The poachers themselves may get
only $200 for making a trip into the
sanctuary. But Das said rhinoceros
horns —- which are actually lumps of
matted hair - command more than
$30,000 a pound. An average horn
weighs more than 1% pounds.

The biggest marketplace for rhino
horns is Singapore, which has declined
to sign the worldwide covenant that
bans the sale of products of endan-
gered species, Das said.

Until five years ago, the demand
for rhinoceros horns could be met by
stealing horns from animals that had
died naturally. In 1980, the problem
here surged as more and more places
made the sale of rhino horns illegal.

By the middle of November, rang-
ers had already found 34 dead rhinos
with their horns removed, almost as
many as the record 37 found in
Kaziranga in 1983.

Rhinoceros poaching is also a prob—
lem in other national parks in Assam
and in other parts of India. Indeed, the
one-horned rhino has become an
endangered species everywhere in
Asia, as has its two-horned cousin in
Africa. ‘ -

Nevertheless, the p0pulation of
rhinos in the Kaziranga preserve has
increased to the present 1,080 from
939 in 1978, and some naturalists
think there are enough to start trans-
porting extras to other national parks
in India.

In 1984, in an effort to preserve
the species by spreading its habitat,
the Indian government flew five
rhinos from Kaziranga to a parkin
northern India, where poaching might
be less of a threat.

Assam naturalists protested,
expressing concern that the tran-
sported rhinos would not be able to
survive in anything less lush than
this swampy flood plain. Political
leaders in Assam regarded the
scheme as an affront.

Two of the five transported rhinos
eventually died, but the government
regarded the experiment as a suc-
cess. “We are looking to see if we
can try more such transport
schemes,” said Dr. MK. Ranjitsinh,
the Indian government director of
wildlife preservation. ~

But his death today will not have

Fritz, about 10 years old, was a gift
from the Bronx Zoo and has been a
problem since he arrived here four
years ago, Director Michael N. Vitan-
tonio said yesterday.

“This male has been attacking the
two females and trying to kill them,”
Vitantonio said. “We haven’t been able

to display him for Over three years
and we haven’t been able to place him
elsewhere, although we’ve tried for
more than two years.”

Vitantonio said euthanasia was a
“normal, everyday procedure” used
With such sick and mean animals.

The decision in this case was made
by the two veterinarians, Drs. Wallace
E. Wendt and Anthony T. Lash, and
Vintantonio, curator Donald J.
Kuenzer and assistant curator Alan L.
Sironen.

Vitantonio said,“This animal is not
mentally all there, in Dr. Wendt’s
Opinion. That comes from so much
inbreeding of the species. As a conse-
quence, he is incompatible with the
tiger group. He tries to harm the
females, so we can’t breed him; he
hasn’t sired any young since he
arrived here.”

Wendt will inject the tiger with bar-
biturates, enough to make him uncon-
scious. Then he will be given an over-
dose of the same drug. After an
aut0psy has been completed, the body
will be cremated.

Rhino poacher now
hunter under the gun

r

Jan. 14,

 

 

By STEVEN R. WEISMAN
new YORK mes
KAZIRANGA,India-—

‘t dusk, a pinpoint of light
shines from inside the for-
est. Slowly the light gets

closer to reveal a Jeep full of hunt-

ers, returning to camp with their

quarry.

But these hunters are actually
government rangers who stalk the
marshes and tall grass in Search of
rhinoceros poachers. Today, they
were unusually successful. Eight
men were captured and one was
killed in three encounters in the pre-
vious 24 hours

“This was one of our biggest
catches,” said P.C. Mahanta, a
ranger who greeted the incoming
hunters. In full view of a reporter, he
and some others proceeded to kick
and beat the suspects during interro-
gation.

This place is the rhinoceros capi-
tal of the world. Kaziranga National
Park, just south of the Brahmaputra
River in the remote northeastern
Indian state of Assam, has 1,080
rhinoceroses, a bigger concentration
than any single territory, including
those 1n Africa.

Once. the species known as the
great Indian one-horned rhinoceros
roamed all across the grasslands of
the Indo—Gangetic plain. Today, the
animal is endangered here, as else-
where, because of encroaching popu-
lation growth and poachers.

The poachers are after the rhino’s
horn, which millions of Asians, par-
ticularly Chinese in Southeast Asia,
continue to prize for its mythical
powers as an aphrodisiac.

Looking for poachers is a frustrat-
ing occupation. Some 100 men patrol
the 270-square-mile preserve,
. searching for footprints and telltale
signs of pits dug in the ground and
camouﬂaged to trap the unsuspect-

inn hpaete

 

He (a government
ranger) and same
others proceeded to
kick and beat the
suspects during
interrogation.

Meanwhile, the poachers stalk the
same territory, looking for signs of
rangers. Encounters often lead to
shootouts

“Usually we shoot at them and
they shoot at us and they run away
and nothing happens,” said P.C. Das,
the chief conservator in Assam.

Das said the government had
thought of looking for poachers from
airplanes, helicopters or balloons.
“But it’s like what the Americans
discovered in Vietnam,” he
explained. “If there is ground cover,
the poachers will be able to hide in
it.”

From atop the park’s trained ele-
phants, visitors can observe the
rhinos grazing, often with an egret
on their back. The rhinos are docile,
although males occasionally attack
each other over a female, and a
mother will sometimes charge
something or someone she feels is
threatening her calf.

Laden with their passengers, the
elephants clump through the grass-
lands in their search. But once found,
the rhinoceroses stare up at the visi-
tors, looking bored and unimpressed.

It is an almost impossible task to
keep intruders from coming into this
huge area. There are no fences to
keep them out, as nearby farmers
who sometimes encounter rhino-
ceroses and elephants on their land
can attest.

FOR THE SURVIVAL
’ _ OF A SPECIES

OF THE POST-USPATCH STAFF

HEETAHS, the swiftest hunters of
the African plains, lack the forti-
tude of a pussycat, genetically
speaking.

_ A cheetah can hit 70 mph as it
closes in for a kill. but the species is in danger of
being overtaken by the forces of extinction. The
St. Louis Zoo is working with others to keep
extinction from nipping at the cheetah’s heels.

Genetically, the cheetah appears to be highly
inbred — breeding any two is like breeding a
brother and sister. That gives the cheetah repro-
ductive problems and leaves it vulnerable to
epidemics.

That kind of fragility is what would be expect-
ed in an animal inbred by humans for centuries
— such as in racehorses bred to concentrate
their speed. But humans had no hand in the
inbreeding of the cheetah, the fastest animal on
land. At some point in the cheetah’s history. it
must have had a close brush with extinction — a
“population bottleneck,” according to research
published last year in the journal Science by
researchers from the United States and South
Africa.

Indian Cheetahs have been wiped out. The last
group was caught in the midst of the Iranian-
Iraqi war, and none of those cheetahs has been
seen for years.

That leaves two groups of cheetahs in the wild
-—— one in southern Africa and another in eastern
Africa. Genetic analyses have been made of
Cheetahs from southern Africa, the source of
most Cheetahs in captivity.

Cheetahs in the wild are having trouble with
fertility, and a large number of cubs —— up to 70
percent — die before maturity. Estimates of the
number of African Cheetahs vary wildly, from
1,500 to 25,000.

Although the cause of the cheetah’s genetic
weakness is unknown, the Zoo can point to some
success in grappling with its consequences at the
Zoo’s Cheetah Survival Center.

About 190 cheetahs live in zoos in North
America — of those, only six females have re-
produced, according to Jack Grisham, an assis~
tant curator who supervises the care of the car-
nivorous mammals.

Kuzi and Sly, a breeding pair at the St. Louis
Zoo. account for a considerable chunk of that
success. They’ve had six litters, a total of 21
cubs, since 1978.

And Kuzi has proved to be a much better
mother than most cheetahs. The death rate for
cheetah cubs is high because of a high incidence
of maternal neglect, according to researchers.
Such undesirable traits are likely to show up in

rip—‘51. Levis Post-Dispatch, Sunday, February is, was

an inbred population of animals.

Kuzi has cared for all but two of her litters.
Zookeepers took over those two litters because of
“adminstrative decisions,”.not maternal neglect,
said Grisham.

- In one litter, a cub needed medical treatment.
so the litter was taken away from Kuzi to make
the cub more accessible. In another litter,‘zoo-
keepers second-guessed Kuzi’s judgment on
weather conditions. “It was cold, and Kuzi kept
taking her cubs outside, so we decided to take
them away,” Grisham said.

Zookeepers do their best to help Kuzi cope
with motherhood, and that means knowing
when to stay away.

Two to four weeks before Kuzi is due to have a
litter, she is moved to the maternity pen, the pen
least accessible to visitors to the Survival Cen-
ter. The bottom of the fence has closely spaced
wire mesh to keep the little ones in, and the pen
even provides a way for Kuzi to get a breather.

“The pen has a tall tree in the middle. Chee-
tahs are good climbers, and when the cubs get to
be too much, Kuzi climbs up there to get away
from them.” Grisham said.

On the day that Kuzi stays in her den instead
of coming out to eat, the zookeeper notiﬁes
Grisham that she may have had a litter. But
Grisham said, “We leave her alone. . . . We don't
go in to check.”

Gestation is short, 90 to 95 days, and the cubs
weigh about a pound at birth. They’re similar to
kittens at birth -— blind and helpless. Kuzi
keeps her cubs ﬁve to six months. Then they’re
weaned and sent to other zoos. .

As the February breeding season approached,
Kuzi appeared to be in racing trim — long and
wiry, with washboard ribs. But Kuzi’s reproduc-
tive days may be drawing to a close.

“She didn’t produce at all last year. She’s 10
years old.” Grisham said “People used to think
9 was old for a cheetah."

The Cheetah Survival Center has three other
females nearly 2 years old, which means that
they’re close to breeding age. The Zoo is starting
a longrange research program to learn more
about cheetahs’ reproduction in the hope of
keeping the big cats from dying out.

Its work is part of a cooperative project set up
by the American Association of Zoological Parks
and Aquariums. Researchers from zoos across
the nation meet once or twice a year to share
their successes and failures.

“No one knows if we will be successful. But
something we do here in St. Louis may wind up
helping somebody else, or we may learn from
what they're doing.” Grisham said.

Research into cheetahs’ behavior has already
helped zoos make Cheetahs less jittery, a first
step toward getting them to reproduce.

“Zoos used to house Cheetahs with the other
big cats - lions and so forth. Well, the Cheetahs
were absolutely intimidated.

“It turns out that in the wild, Cheetahs are
always on the periphery. The larger predators
are antagonists.” Grisham said.

With that in mind, the Cheetah Survival Cen-
ter was built on the western outskirts of the Zoo.
It was designed to give the Cheetahs some priva-
cy, because they are solitary animals in the wild.
“Two females with cubs might get together. or
males might hunt together once in a while. But

that's rare,” Grisham said.

The center was opened in the fall of 1974. It
offers more than the comforts of home, with
heating coils in the ﬂoor of each cheetah’s den.
The Cheetahs roam 1% acres — occasionally
turning on the speed to dash after an unwary
squirrel

From rock outcroppings on top of the dens,
the Cheetahs can keep an eye on the animals in
the yard of the Elephant House -— much as they
would from solitary perches 1n the wild.

Adapting the environment to the Cheetahs in-
stead of the other way around helps -— as shown
by Kuzi's six litters — but more must be done to
overcome the breeding problems caused by ge-

 

netic frailty.

Male cheetahs have low sperm counts and a
high percentage of malformed sperm. And
they’re easily dissuaded from breeding. “A cuff
from a female, and the male walks away,” said
Grisharn.

The Zoo wants to produce cheetah cubs
through artiﬁcial insemination; to ﬁnd out how
to do that, it has hired Jenny Balke, a reproduc-
tive physiologist. ln artificial insemination, a
researcher takes a sperm sample from a male.
When a female is found to be fertile, she is
impregnated with the sperm that was collected.

Balke has begun her work by examining the
Zoo’s Cheetahs — four females and seven males

— for fertility. The cheetahs are restrained for
the examinations.

But for artificial insemination to work. the
Zoo must come up with a female cheetah who
can be handled without restraints or drugs.
Stress or drugs could trigger a spontaneous
abortion.

“Ideally. we’d start with a female cub and
condition her to being handled.” Grisham said.
He expects the project to take years.

The Zoo “has been lucky” in avoiding cata-
strophic illnesses in the Cheetahs. One cheetah

vaccinates its cheetahs

ber of other disease—causing :

could be used in cheetahs,
breeding programs could in-
volve even more animals,
Grisham said. Instead of
shipping male cheetahs to
other centers, zoos could
freeze their sperm and ship
that, he explained.

While cheetahs are at risk,
scientists see some encourag-
ingsigns.

In the study reported in
Science, researchers say,
“The future of the captive
breeding programs and even
of the species may appear
bleak. Nonetheless, there are

some hopeful consuierations
that bear on the management
and survival of the cheetah.”
They point out that in-
breeding has been reduced in
such endangered animals as
the Speke’s gazelle through
innovative breeding pro-
grams. Research at the Zoo
here led to a better breeding
program for that gazelle, but
Grisham pointed out that the
cheetah was far more inbred
than the gazelle. _ '
Protective legislation can
help endangered species even
if they are inbred, the article
says. Thousands of northern

elephant seals, an inbred ani-
mal, have ﬂourished off the
California coast since the
seals got legal protection.

If the cheetah in eastern
Africa has different genetic
characteristics from the chee-
tah in southern Africa, it
might be used to reduce in-
breeding among captive chee-
tahs, the researchers say. And
' the geographic distribution of
; ' the cheetahs is a safety factor.
If an Epidemic should deci-
mate cheetahs in one part of
Africa, the others would be
far enough away to esca e
damage, the scientists say. D

y.
Both procedures were done
at the Mallinckrodt Institute

of Radiology at Barnes Hos- g

pital. The red carpet was
rolled out for Harpo, a chee-
tah on loan from the Atlanta
Zoo, but he’ll have no tales to
tell when he gets home.

Harpo was anesthetized at
the Zoo here, and he stayed
under for the entire four-hour
excursion.

“It was the most fabulous
thing to see these doctors just
performing these extremely
specialized diagnostic tests on
this cheetah. They’d stroke it
and inject it -— just exactly
like we'd do to a very, very
special patient," said a
spokeswoman for the
institute.

The trip was prompted by
Dr. Louis A. Gilula, co—direc-
tor of the institute’s musculo-

skeletal section. As a volun- .

teer consultant in radiology
for the Zoo, Gilula found out
that the Zoo was planning
surgery for Harpo. Its X—rays
showed signs of a ruptured
disc.

Gilula told the Zoo’s veteri-

narian, Dr. William J. Boe--

ver, that a simpler procedure
that is used on humans might
work for Harpo. The institute
uses injections of chymopa-
pain, an enzyme, in some
cases to dissolve ruptured
discs, avoiding surgery.

Gilula suggested that
Harpo be brought in on a
Sunday, when few patients
would be around. He was
wheeled in through a back en—
trance and “didn’t see a single
patient,” Gilula said.

An orthopedic surgeon, Dr.
Lee T. Ford, was standing by
to inject the enzyme if the
tests showed that Harpo had
a ruptured disc. Instead, the
tests turned up a fractured
vertebra and a displaced disc.
Rest, not surgery, was pre-
scribed, and Harpo appears to
be recovering back in his pen.

Harpo got “special treat-
ment” because cheetahs are
an endangered species, Gilula
explained. “That’s why we’d
do so much for an animal ——
to save the race.” ’

 

He noted that the incident

was a turnaround,
research done on

“Usually,
animals is

used to help humans. This

time, technology devel

oped

for humans was used to help

an animal," he said.

200 ATLANTA

Two years ago

the dilapidated, 95-

year old Atlanta

City Zoo became

Atlanta’s biggest

embarrassment.

The city was scan-

dalized when one of

its elephants, supposedly recuperating at

a farm, died while traveling with a cir-

cus in South Carolina. Deaths of other

animals were uncovered, leading to a

citizens’ outcry to close the zoo, possi-
bly the most primitive in the country.

This is being turned around by its
new director, Dr. Terry Maple, a psy-
chology professsor on loan from the
Georgia Institute of Technology. Dr.
Maple, an expert on animal adjustment
to captivity, succeeded in rescuing the
200 from a welter of City Hall red tape;
now, it is governed by an autonomous
nine-member board of the Atlanta-Ful-
ton County Recreation Authority. The
facility was renamed Zoo Atlanta to re-
flect the fact that the county now kicks
in one-third of its budget.

The best news for the 200’s future
was the December sellout of the author-
ity’s $16 million bond issue, which will
fund the building of natural habitats for
zoo animals. The reconstructiorgwill be
phased in overa five-year period. “This
is the most significant event in the his-
tory of the zoo,” boasts Dr. Maple.
“Rebuilding will set the tone of the zoo
for the next 100 years.”

Another $9 million is being raised 10-
cally, primarily from the business com-
munity; Chairman Robert Strickland of
SunTrust Co. is spearheading the drive.

High on the list of animals to be freed
is the 200’s No. 1 celebrity, Willie B., a
27-year old gorilla that gained fame for
his inveterate television watching. His
TV habits titillated many but infuriated
zoologists who saw an abused beast de-
prived of company (gorillas are very so-
cial) and mesmerized by picture images
inside his cramped cell. Dr. Maple,
however, refuses to fault previous man-
agement for exploiting Willie B. “To
dramatize his plight, a humorous side
was shown,” Dr. Maple says. “The
media picked up on the humorous side
and not on the serious side.” But early
next year, Willie B. will be free.

Already in use is a $270,000 veteri-
nary clinic. Previously, animals had to
be shipped away for treatment, usually
to Auburn University, delaying care.
Too, a new management team has been

p 10 200 in sight?
hired; for the first time the 200 has a
full-time veterinarian with a Ph.D., a
business manager and a public relations
executive. “We are moving from a bot-
tom-10 zoo to a top-10 zoo,” Dr. Ma-
ple trumpets. .

To achieve that goal, Dr. Maple 15
leading the facility toward the serious
work of a great zoo: the preservation of
species. That means preparing captive
animals whose species are endangered
for reintroduction into the wild. It also
means sperm banking as well as geneti-
cism, which will be practiced by im-
planting fertilized eggs from one womb
to another to prevent a breed from van—
ishing.

“We intend to be on the cutting edge
of technology for the preservation of
habitat and propagation of species,”
Dr. Maple says.

CALIFORNIA MAGAZINE - March 1986

San Diego Zoo

The city’s most popular attraction is the
San Diego Zoo. Set in 100 acres of lush
gardens in Balboa Park, the zoo is home to

some 3,000 animals of 800 species. A fore-
runner among those zoos that attempt to
recreate animals' natural habitats, the San
Diego Zoo houses most of its residents in
moatlike enclosures without bars. To stroll
through the park’s luxuriant valleys is to
pass through a number of continents and
view the wild creatures of each.

Founded in 1916 by San Diego Doctor
Harry Wegeforth, the Zoological Society
started out with a handful of animals left
over from the Panama-California Interna-
tional Exposition. Many local species were

gathered, some of which were traded for
more exotic animals from abroad. Today
the zoo is renowned not only for. the rarity
and diversity of its animal population butfor
its extensive educational and conservation
eﬁegistors may walk the grounds, a rich bo-
tanical garden of rare and colorful flora, or
take the 40-minute guided bus tour, which
in itself provides a good orientation. The
Children’s Zoo offers a petting area and a
baby-animal nursery. Special behind-the-
'scenes tours are available for groups of 15
or more.

Wild Animal Park

Unfortunately, Wegeforth did not live to
see the natural culmination of his animal-

Sea World

For a look at the animals that live beneath
the sea, there's no better place than San
Diego’s Sea World in Mission Bay. Cover-
ing 100 acres along the ocean's edge, the
park is a water wonderland of aquariums,
marine—life exhibits, and performing sea
mammals.

The undisputed star of Sea World is
Shamu, a three-ton killer whale, who, along
with mate Candu, dazzles audiences with
grand-scale water acrobatics. The giant

black and white mammals take
their human trainers on
whirlwind rides and gently
kiss willing visitors.

Between shows, guests can touch
or view live animals at various
sea—life exhibits, one of the
most popular of which is the $7
million Penguin Encounter that
opened in 1983. Populated with
six species of more than 300
Antarcitc penguins in their
natural environment, it is a
re-creation of the frozen South
Polar region. 'Visitors watch
the penguins swim, get fed, and
lounge about on the ice. The
exhibit is so realistic that the

penguins have actually begun breeding.
Other Sea World exhibits include the pet-

keeping philosophy—a zoo in which the
spectators are caged and the animals run
free. In 1972 the Zoological Society
opened the San Diego Wild Animal Park,
an 1,800-acre wildlife preserve in the San

' idowntown
Pasqual Valley, 30 miles north 0
San Diego. Visitors to the park board the

ting pool, with dolphins and small pilot
whales; the world’s largest live shark ex-
hibit; the California sea otter environment; a
walrus pool; and a tank of rare Commer-
son’s dolphins.

Although its focus is entertainment, over
the years Sea World has worked extenswely

Wgasa Bush Line monorail for a journey
into the wild. Because the climate and ter-
rain of San Diego are similar to the climate
and terrain of much of Africa and ASia, the
park has been able to'create comfortable
habitats for many speCies. 1

After the monorail trip, safari travelers can
take the Kilimanjaro Trail to get close-up
views of lions basking in the sun and kan-
garoos and-wallabies roaming the Austra-
lian Rain Forest. Nairobi Village is a recrea-

Last days of
the condor?

By W.B. TYSON

 

SAN DIEGO

ne Way or the other, 1986

’probably will be the year in

which all California condors
disappear from the wild. But extinc-
tion of the species can be avoided.

There are two choices. The last six
birds remaining in the wilderness
can either be left there to take their
chances with alarmingly high mor-
tality statistics or they can be placed
in captivity before they are shot, poi-
soned or killed by explosive cyanide
devices known as “coyote-getters.”
Six were lost last year alone, proba-
bly to one or more of these causes.

With extinction of the wild birds a
virtual certainty, the California
Department of Fish and Game, the
US. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
US. Forest Service, the Los Angeles
Zoo, the San Diego Zoo and Wild
Animal Park and a number of con-
cerned organizations and individuals
have cooperated in the California
condor recovery program. The
objective is to breed condors in the
relative safety of captivity so that in
time they can be released back into
the wild, gradually building in num-
bers to a point where they can main-
tain themselves once again.

This cooperative effort has not,
however, enjoyed unanimous sup-
port. The three major conservation
organizations, the Audubon Society,
the Friends of the Earth and the
Sierra Club, have historically put
their confidence in Mother Nature
and their hearts in the phi1050phy of
“living free.” Conversely, most biol-
ogists have argued that the “wild” in
which the condors now live is no
longer the same wilderness in which
the condors once thrived — that

Mother Nature cannot st0p selfish, ,

mindless humans from shooting and
poisoning North America’s largest
bird into extinction.

The biologists’ logic is persuasive.
Because the condors’ historical
home is now so dangerous, and their
numbers so few, they cannot survive
as a species without a breeding pro-
gram in captivity. At this point, their
chances of surviving for more than a
year or two are essentially nil, and
the probability of their being lost in
the next few weeks or months is
disturbingly high.

The good news in the, midst of all
the gloom is that there are many
reasons for believing that a breeding

program will succeed and that
enough birds will be produced to
return them to the wild under more
favorable circumstances. Andean
condors, a very similar species, have
been successfully bred in captivity
and released back into the wild for
years.

Meanwhile, the success with rais-
ing California condors from eggs has
been nothing short of phenomenal.
Out of 15 eggs, a dozen baby condors
have been raised at the San Diego
Wild Animal Park. In the wild, half
of the eggs hatch, at best. Of those,
only one in 10 of the chicks survives
to sexual maturity. Clearly, the odds
for survival are better in captivity.

The Fish and Wildlife Service
recently abandoned its earlier view,
which it shared with the conserva-
tion organizations, that three birds
should be left in the wild. The ser-
vice now supports their capture. But
the political bickering and delays

. already are taking their toll on the

birds.

On Jan. 3, a breeding female,
which had been captured once
before but released, was found to be
so sick from lead poisoning that she
could be caught by hand. She was

brought to the San Diego Wild Ani- '

mal Park’s California condor center
for examination and treatment. She
rallied encouragingly but then did
not eat. The lead already had done
too much damage, and she died.

One would think that such an
event would bring the armchair
“conservationists” to their senses.
But the Audubon Society has
obtained a temporary injunction in
federal court barring the capture of
any more birds. That means the

society has in effect rolled back the ’

previous agreement to leave only
three birds in the wild. Now, it
seems to be saying that all the
remaining wild condors should be
left to take their chances with shoot-
ers and poison.

It would be ironic and unfortunate
if the condors were lost while those
trying to save them are squabbling

in the courts. The birds thus sacris
ficed to political bickering might '

have made the numerical and
genetic difference between the
extinction and survival of the spe-
cies.

OAKLAND TRIBUNE — February 20, 1986

Dim future for California condor

Extmction near as n umber in Wild drops from 40 to 5 1'12 decade

By Cass Peterson
The Washington Post

A national effort to save the
California condor from extinction
has come down to this: At a recent
court hearing on the fate of the
bird, there were more lawyers in
the room than there are condors in
the wild.

Despite an ambitious recovery
program financed by millions of
private and federal dollars, the
number of condors clinging to sur-
vival in their last citadel amid the
mountains of Southern California
has dwindled from 40 to five in less
than a decade.

Twenty-one more are in captivi-
ty as part of a breeding program to
replenish the natural population,
but the first release of young birds
had to be scrapped last year when
the Los Angeles Zoo, through’a bu-
reaucratic snafu, tamed the candi-
dates. Future release plans have
been put on hold while the zoo tries
to reverse the taming process.

In the meantime, the US. Fish
and Wildlife Service says it cannot
guarantee the safety of the few re-
maining wild condors, and it wants

, to trap and cage all five.

“The California condor is a high-
ly endangered bird threatened with
extinction in the very near future,”
said Jan Riffe of the wildlife serv-
ice. “If we cannot control mortali-
ty, we don’t want to take the risk.”

Environmentalists fear the move
will open the condor’s mountainous
preserve to development and erase
its last slim h0pe of surviving in the
wild.

Zoo officials “think they can

breed them for 20 years and then
release them,” said the Sierra
Club’s Mark Palmer. “They are
dreadfully naive about the politics
of the situation.”

~ For the moment, the environ-
mentalists are on top. Last week,
”the National Audubon Society won
a federal district court ruling that
forbids the government from trap-
ping more condors.

But the ruling, if it survives an
appeal, may deflect only temporar-
ily a debate that has far-reaching
implications for the nation’s 20-
year-old program to salvage its
vanishing species. In essence, the
question is this: If it is deemed too
risky — or too expensive -— to
maintain a species in the wild, is it
enough to keep it alive in a zoo?

For some conservationists, the
answer is no.

“I don’t see the point,” said
Palmer. “We’re trying to restore
our ecosystem, not sweep it under
the rug. It sounds like the Fish and
Wildlife Service is turning its back
on the whole endangered-species
program.”

Both conservationists and wild-
life officials agree that, for the Cali-
fornia condor, there is some urgen-
cy to answering the question.

A carrion-eating vulture with a
naked orange head and hulking
black body, the condor is a forlorn-
looking creature in an aviary. But it
is the vision of splendor soaring
above a mountain ridge, its 10-foot
wingspan spread to catch the warm
updrafts that can keep it aloft for
an hour without flapping a wing.

vation groups have battled to save
the high-flying condor, the largest
land bird in North America and a
heroic symbol of the wilderness
that once was California.

But the condor’s natural habits
and requirements make it a partic-
ularly difficult species to protect.

It feeds on animal carcasses,
which were in plentiful supply when
the arid wilderness hosted numer-
ous large predators. Today, the car-
casses are likely to contain bullet
fragments or be laced with poisons

to protect livestock from what pre- '

dators remain.

In recent years, at least three
condors died of lead poisoning and
another was accidentally poisoned
by a coyote trap set by the federal
wildlife service.

Habitat poses another knotty
problem. Despite their diminished
numbers, the birds range widely
ever more than 10 million acres of
mountain canyons and brown hills
in central and southern California.
About 2 million of that is in federal
hands. Much of the rest is just east
of the densely populated California
coast and under heavy development
pressure.

The habitat controversy has
centered on the Hudson Ranch, a
privately owned 14,000-acre tract

strategically located in the south- ‘

central part of the condor’s horse-
shoe-shaped range.

Thermal air currents in the area
make it attractive to the gliding
birds, and federal biologists have
made it even more so by feeding the
birds there in an effort to prevent

more deaths by poisoning.

At the urging of environmental-
ists and federal biologists, Congress
appropriated nearly $9 million to
purchase the ranch as a condor ref-
uge. The money has never been
spent, partly because the owner is
unwilling to accept the govern—
ment’s $5 million offer and partly
because the Office of Management
and Budget is unenthusiastic about
spending money on a refuge for a
bird many believe is doomed.

Bird lovers
win against
city cOde

By DAVID SZYMANSKI
Tribune Staff Writer

A Tampa code cannot stop a
pair of exotic bird lovers from en-

joying their 10 macaws, parrot and .

cockatoo because the code cannot
regulate certain wildlife, a County
Court judge said Friday.

However, Judge Robert H. Bo-
nanno said the bird lovers may be
tried under the city’s nuisance law
if neighbors complain about noise
emanating from the large metal
birdhouse in a back yard at 2903
Okara Road.

Bonanno ruled that Michelle
Ginsburg and David Hosley were
not violating a city code of “har-
boring exotic animals.”

Parrots technically are wild-
life, which are controlled by the
state’s Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, said Ginsburg’s attor-
ney, Diana Allen.

Bonanno agreed and said the
state regulation pre-empts the
city’s authority to regulate the pets.

“I was pleased the judge agreed
with ourtheory of the case, but I
don’t believe the problems are
over with the city,” Allen added.
“There may be others ordinances
that apply.”

City Attorney Martin Hernan-
dez, who argued the case for the
city, said he will be rewriting the
city code “as soon as possible" to
regulate more specifically the
noise and odor of pets.

He added that the next time a
similar case occurs in Tampa, the
city will prosecute the case as a

is regulated by city codes.

“Let’s say youhave 50 macaws
screaming to beat the band. Is that
alright?” Bonanno asked Allen in
court

Hernandez and Allen both
agreed the state does not regulate
the number of parrots or wildlife
one can have, only if they are sold
commercially.

“It seems you can have a Busch

you want,” Hernandez said.

The city has not used its nui-
sance law often because of the dif-
ficulty in getting witnesses and

proving the details of a nuisance in
neighborhoods, said City Attorney
Thomas Saunders. However, he
added the Ginsburg case could be
an exception.

‘ “It’s possible the city would be
successful, but it’s very difficult to
prove a nuisance,” Saunders said.

Hernandez said the city will not
pursue the case unless any other
neighbors complain about the
birds.

The couple’s neighborhood bor-
ders Busch Gardens to the west
and their birds occasionally will
answer the birds from the nature
park, Hosley said. However, Hosley

said the birds only scream brieﬂy
at dusk and dawn, their natural
feeding times.

“This was a step in the right di-
rection,” Ginsburg said. “But after .
what happened the first time (in
court), I’m not ready to say its all
over. I’m not going to say the stone
has been lifted.”

In the first court appearance in
March 1985, County Court Judge
Susan Bucklew found Ginsburg not
guilty of harboring exotic animals,
but after more complaints from a
neighbor, Bonanno found Ginsburg
guilty Jan. 13.

 

 

 




DETROIT FREE PRESS - Feb. 21, 1986

California growls at idea
of relocating bears to state

By TERRY YOUNG
.Los Anoeles Daily News '

LOS ANGELES — You see them
free in the breeze. Sometimes flapping
with wild abandonment, the grizzly
bears emblazoning California’s state
flag are about the only ones you’ll see
outside of a 200.

All others in California, once known
as the Bear Flag Republic, were killed
by the state’s human inhabitants more
than 60 years ago. The last one was
spotted in 1922.

MONTANA, the state with one of
the largest populations of grizzlies —
yet there are probably fewer than
1,000 there — offered California and
other states some of its grizzly wealth
last year. California’s response? A
.. bearish “thanks, but no thanks.”

“Relocating problem grizzly bears
into California would present some
serious economic concerns, as well as a
hazard to public safety,” wrote El-
dridge Hunt, chief of the wildlife man-
agement branch of the state Depart-

ment of Fish and Game, when he

responded to the offer.
* According to Terry Mansfield, a

wildlife management supervisor, the'

department’s attitude toward grizzlies
is not likely to change this year, despite
renewed efforts by dauntless Montana
officials, who are making another try
at their relocation offer.
Other states told Montana bluntly
what they thought of the idea.
Alaska officials said they might
' consider the grizzly offer “if Montana
-would consider a trade of Alaskan
_ wolves for Montana bears. Presumably
such an exchange would be made on a
pound-for-pound basis.”

“OREGON has no plans to reintro-
duce grizzlys (sic) now or in the future.
We have enough problems with black
bears. Do you want any black bears?”
one official wrote.

Officials in New Mexico declined
the offer but suggested that Montana

contact Mexico about the program.

The state of Colorado went so far as
to adopt a resolution declaring “its
opposition to every person or entity
which may now or in the future sug-
gest or plan the reintroduction of . ..
the grizzly bear.”

Clearly, the grizzly, which has been
known to attack humans, has not made a
many allies.

Yet the creature, which can grow to
weigh 1,000 pounds, does have some
supporters.

The Montana-based Great Bear
Foundation claims a small but passion-
ate membership of 500 devoted to the
preservation of grizzlies.

The rejection of Montana’s reloca-
tion offer comes as no surprise to Lance
Olsen, the organization’s president.

“The response was predictable,”
Olsen said.

However, he believes the attitude
among wildlife officials will change if

 

the public demonstrates a desire to
foster grizzly reintroduction.

 

THE FEDERAL government is an
example of that change, Olsen said.
“They were once charged with trying
to eliminate grizzlies; now they are ”
trying to save them,” Olsen pointed
out. ’

But it is too late to save the grizzlies
in California. ‘

David McRill, a Quincy resident,
expressed his feelings in a letter to
Olsen. “The grizzly bear is California’s
state animal,” he said. “I find it ironic
that a zoo is the only place we can
observe this majestic creature in the
state.”

Critics: Conditions still
poor at Clayton pound

 

By Bert Roughton Jr.
Staff Writer

 

Despite a year and a half of
romised reform, conditions have
improved very little for the animals
at Clayton County’s Rabies Control
Center, animal rights advocates say.

“It’s basically the same,” said
Beverly C0peland, treasurer of
Clayton County’s Humane Society.
"It’s been changed from being under
the county’s Health Department to
the county’s Refuse Department.
But, other than that, things are
about the same.”

Mrs. Copeland led the fight in
1984 to improve conditions at the
pound, which she labeled a “dis-
grace to all Clayton countians.”

The fight ended in the county’s
agreeing to improve the lot of ani-
mals at the cramped center, which
was built in the 19503. But judged
on size, manpower, budget and ani-

mal death rate, the Clayton pound.

remains metro Atlanta’s worst.

“There has been no change
there and there is none in sight for
the future,” Mrs. Copeland said.
“The same things are happening all
over again.’

James Satterfield, the director
of refuse control, countered that
conditions at the pound have im-
proved and will continue to im-
prove.

“Things are better there,” Sat-
terfield said. Although he could
name few specific changes at the
pound, he said the county plans at
an undetermined date to enlarge the
facility.

“We have worked with the Hu-
mane Society on their complaints
and tried to do what we could.
We’re trying hard to run the place
better and keep it cleaner,” he said.

The death rate for animals at
the cinderblock structure in Jones-
boro has improved from 90 percent
in 1983 to about 73 percent in 1985,
but that is about twice the death
rate at shelters in other counties.

Mrs. Copeland attributed the im-
provement to the Humane Society,
which now has an office at the
pound and employees who try to
find homes for animals.

Nevertheless, Clayton killed
about 90 percent of the 2,000 cats it
picked up in 1985, said Robert
Folds, the pound master. More than
4,000 of 6,000 dogs, about 68 per-
cent, were killed.

pound: They do the most they can ,
with what they’ve got,” she said.

““They’ve just got nothing to work

The animals still wait to die in
a poorly ventilated building buzzing
with flies and fleas, even though the
pound is kept somewhat cleaner
than before, Mrs. COpeland said.

But the county has failed to hire
additional workers, add space or
employ a vet for the pound.

In its 1985 budget, the Clayton
County Commission allocated
$160,284, by far the smallest budget
for a pound in metro Atlanta. Gwin-
nett County, whose animal control
Operation is the closest in size to
Clayton’s, allocated $276,973 in

1985, while Cobb County budgeted.

$415,531.

Clayton County’s pound still is
staffed by eight employees who,

with the exception of Folds, have no

special training.

Animals receive little medical
attention, Folds said. “If we get one
that’s hurt or broke down, we do
away with it.” No veterinarian is
officially affiliated with the pound,
although three act as advisers to
Folds and his men.

Because of state intervention,
pound employees no longer can kill
animals with lethal injections of
drugs, so doomed animals are put
into one of two gas chambers. The
chambers are filled with carbon
monoxide from gasoline engines,
suffocating the animals.

Mrs. C0peland places blame for
conditions at the pound squarely on
the County Commission, which has
been reluctant to finance more sub—

service,” says Cary Mongero, Pet
Find’s director. “We’re completely
computerized; we have trained opera-
tors on duty twenty-four hours a day,
so callers will never get an answering
service; arid we’ll search for lost pets
whether they’re registered with us

or not.” _

People who register their pets with
Pet Find receive a reflective collar tag
stamped with a registration number
and the toll-free telephone number.
Detailed descriptions of registered pets
are kept in computerized files, along
with instructions about what to do if
someone calls to report that the animal
has been picked up as a stray. If Pet
Find receives such a report and can't
reach the animal’s owner, the organiza-
tion will make arrangements for an au-
thorized person to claim the pet right
away.

Pet Find can sometimes locate un-
registered pets because the organiza-
tion’s operators take reports about
stray animals from anyone who calls.
“Usually we’ll hear from someone who
has found-an animal first, and later the
owner will call to report the loss,”
Mongero explains.

Pet Find began registering pets last '
June, and it is just beginning to expand
its operations beyond the Northwest.
Gary Mongero hopes that the organi-
zation will become so well known that
it will soon be receiving lost-pet reports
from all over the country. With the
toll-free number, it’s as easy for people
to call from Portland, Maine, as from
Portland, Oregon, Mongero points
out.

The initial fee to register a pet with
Pet Find is $15, and it costs $10 to re-
new the registration each year. Anyone
who uses the service to search for an
unregistered pet will be charged the in-
itial registration fee. For further infor-
mation, write to Pet Find, Incorpo-

ferret’s neck -— as some later radio
.coiiars did —— according to the BFaT
minutes.

,The error was inadvertent, Clark
believes. Wildlife biologists are
trained to monitor and protect ani-
mals, such as mule deer and ducks,
that go up and down in number but
are at no risk of vanishing, he said.
“They assumed the ferrets are with
us now and always will be there.”

In this, Clark said, WG&F offi-
cials pursued a policy of “calcula-
tive rationality,” which has “stifled”
the “more creative” approaches
needed to revivify endangered spe-
cies.
They assumed a diligent search
would uncover other ferrets in other
prairie-dog towns elsewhere in the
millions of square miles of plains in
the West. Harju, in a recent phone
interview, said he continues to be-
lieve that. But Clark, having spent
years looking for the ferrets, doubts,
others will be found.

It was the game-biologist mind
frame, Clark said, that led to the cur-
rent disaster. But, he said, the rule
of animal husbandry WG&F violat-
ed, in fact, is an axiom of standard
game management: A valuable
group of animals always should be
divided. so if disease or other ill
strikes one half, the other half sur-
vives to maintain the group.

Two plans were being discussed
for the ferrets: Move some directly
to another prairie-dog town, or cap-
ture some for breeding so their off-
spring could be moved elsewhere.

The WG&F dragged its feet. One
understandable reason is that an
earlier USFWS captive-breeding ef-
fort had ended in disaster.

Nevertheless, by 1984, Clark,
representing his own views and
those of several prestigious conser-

vation organizations, and a USFWS
biologist urged that ferrets “immedi-
ately”. be caught for breeding Sev-
eral wellvstaffed and well-equipped
facilities, including one run by the
Smithsonian Institution, were avail-
able for this effort;

But WG&F decided, according to
the BFAT minutes of July 10, 1984,
that the captive breeding would
have to be done in Wyoming --
where there was no suitable facility.

Very shortly, there would be few
ferrets left to take. But the inclina-
tion at WG&F in 1984 was not to
worry. Veterinarian Tom Thorne,
who was slated to run WG&F’s cap-
tive-breeding effort, is quoted in the
minutes as saying: “The urgency to
captivate ’(sic) ferrets ‘ has been
overemphasized. If the concern is to
avert unforeseen demise of the Mee-
teetse ferret population, then the
captivation of ferrets can be accom-
plished when, and if, such an emer-

gency occurs. With the researchers

studying (that) population, we
should have pienty of lead time to
rescue some from a die-off if the
need arises.”

The first trouble at Meeteetse
last spring hit the ferrets’ prairie-
dog prey, not the ferrets themselves.
The flea-borne plague struck the
prairie dogs, and while no more than
20 percent of them died, all parties
— WG&F, USFWS and private con-
servationists — cooperated in an
emergency effort to spread an insec-
ticide across the prairie-dog towns
that kills plague-bearing ﬂeas.

Whether the plague or the flea
poison had anything to do with what
happened next, to the ferrets, is nu-
clear and may never be known.

What is known is that late in
June, or perhaps early in July last
year, Crete and Steve Forrest, a
biologist who works for Clark’s com-
pany, decided to check the ferrets.

The method for counting ferrets
in summer is to walk through the
prairie-dog towns at night carrying a
spotlight. When present, the ferrets,
which are active at night, are easy to
see. .

“We looked for about three or
four hours," Crete recalled. “Nei-
ther of us saw a ferret.

“I think that night Steve and I
about cried. It was like walking into
a mortuary. We knew something was
starting then.” ‘

By early August. Clark said,
WG&F and BFAT had been told in
writing that something was wrong.
But the Wyoming officials did noth-
ing for weeks.

Harju conceded in a phone inter-
view that he at first was not worried,
because he knew that Biota had less
money, and hence was surveying
smaller areas than in previous
years.

Only in September, when ferrets
routinely are trapped for radio-tag-
ging, did it become clear, Harju said,
that something was seriously wrong.
So he ordered that some of the re-
maining ferrets be trapped _ for
breeding .

The trapping commenced and
because the Wyoming facility for
captive breeding was not finished,
six captured ferrets were put in indi-
vidual cages close together in a
room. This violated standard quar-
antine procedures for taking ani-
mals from the wild, Clark said. They
should have been separated from
each other to prevent the spread of
disease.

Then a rash was noticed on one
ferret’s body. A meeting, mean-
while, had been called at WG&F
headquarters in Cheyenne. It was
now October.

Hariu recalled: “We weren’t sure
what those ferrets had. We were sus-
picious. We sat in the meeting for
about half a day, with people shout-

ing at each other as to whether the -
plague was or was not killing the fer-
rets. Then, about 11 o’clock, the vet

(Thorne) showed up and said the
diagnosis was distemper.”

(Distemper is about as deadly

for ferrets as AIDS is for people.)

It now was clear that a disaster

had occurred and that the time that
Thorne had said could be used for a
rescue had largely gone by, because
WG&F did not believe the bad news
that Crete and Clark and its other
cbnsultant biologists were reporting.

The six ferrets died. Six others
were trapped and quarantined; they
appear healthy, and breeding efforts
may start this spring.

Clark bluntly blames WG&F and
USFWS administrators for the fer-
rets’ dire problem. “It was ideologi-
cally incomprehensible to them that

the ferret could be declining that
quickly," he said. '

Hariu offered a different analy-
sis: “Having disparate groups in-
volved that are constantly throwing
rocks at each other is a damned
poor way to run a program. If I had
it to do over, the first time I heard
someone backstabbing someone
else, I’d kick him the hell out of
there immediately.” ,

No one knows how many ferrets
still exist in the wild around Mee-
teeise, but Crete said little sign is
being found. He and Clark think
there are far fewer than 30 wild fer-
rets left there.

A census will be possible in
April, and after that, Harju said, a
decision will be made on whether to
try to catch the survivors for captive
breeding

As the biologists ponder their
next steps, some, including Crete
and Clark, are trying to conjure up
better ways to manage these and
other endangered animals. Clark
has turned to the political sciences
to find organizational models that
might bring together disparate gov-
ernmental and private groups — and
people — in open, productive endan-
gered-species programs. He tenta-
tively proposes what he calls “paral-
lel-structure organization,” a method
that has been used successfully by
General Motors. It is set up along-
side a bureaucracy and facilitates
task-oriented management; Key
decisions are made by participants
closest to the problems.

Clark and Crete said scientific
and organizational reform will not
come from within a bureaucracy; it
must be imposed from above, by
USFWS — which thus far has abne-
gated its national obligation by not
cracking a whip over Wyoming G&F
— or by Congress. .

In Crete’s view, the key missing
element has been individual respon-

sibility. Management and decision-

making are too badly scattered for
any one person to be -- or be held

Controversy
surrounding the
black-footed ferret is
important for the light
it can shed on how the
Endangered Species
Act is being used.

By DAVID R. ZlMMERMAN
Newsday

MALTA, Mont. —- This is the win-
ter of Tim Clark’s discontent. Clark
is a peripatetic freelance biologist, a
world expert on the black-footed fer-
ret, the cute carnivore that has won
endearment as America’s most en-
- dangered mammal.

Clark is deeply distressed, as are
' the ferret’s many other fans and
would-be saviors, because last sum-
mer disaster struck the one known
group of these animals in the world,
far south of here in a place called
Meeteetse, Wyo. Most of the 130 fer:
rets there appear to have died of a
respiratory disease called distem-
per, which may doom the species.

The black-footed ferret is a
minklike animal that weighs about
two pounds and is the only wild spe-
cies of ferret in the United States. It

feeds largely on prairie dogs and
lives in burrows in prairiedog colo»
pies known as tam-as. Clark has come
to this area in the northern Greet:
Plains because rites; airtingist aria
overgrazing by cattle have hank»
rupted many ranches and tame}, a;
lowing much land to lie fallow or be
used just for grazing.

As a result, the prairie dogs, once
poisoned almost into oblivion by
ranchers -— and by the federal gov-
ernment at their behest — are
beginning to recover their numbers.
This in turn has raised Clark’s hope
that the new prairie-dog towns may
harbor ferrets. Winter is the time he
might find them by observing their
tracks and scat (droppings) in the
snow.

Unfortunately, on this day Clark
finds no ferret signs. He guesses that
he has inspected a third of a million
prairie-dog burrows in several thou
sand prairie-dog towns along the
length and breadth of the western
Plains, and associates in his Biota
Research Co. of Jackson, Wyo., have
looked at an additional million bur-
rows. Neither they nor other ferret
finders have seen definite signs of
them in recent years, except at Mee-
teetse, where the ferrets first were
found in 1981.

What particularly distresses
Clark, and some of his co-workers, is
his belief that last summer’s loss was
not fate, or bad luck, as federal and
Wyoming officials suggest. Rather,
Clark said angrily, the disaster was

due in large part to human factors:

administrative and institutional fail-
ures and politics. He also said that
shortcomings in the scientific ap-
proach to the ferrets “foreordained”
failure.

“Failure is built into the bureau-
cratic organization that usually is

brought to bear in endangered-spe‘

cies management,” Clark said in in-
terviews here.

Official minutes of the Black
Footed Ferret Advisory Team, or
BFAT, set up by the Wyoming Game

{ and Fish Department to guide its re-
‘ covery work, support key charges

made by Clark and others. But BFAT
chairman Harry Harju, who is super-
visor of biological services for

WG&F, rejects this criticism, saying,

“Hindsight is always 20-20."

 

While mistakes were made,
Harju concedes, were he able to turn
back the clock, he said he would
take the same actions. given com-
parable knowledge.

The controversy is important be-

yond the well-publicized case of the
ferret for the light it can shed on
how well the federal Endangered
Species Act is being used to protect
all the animals and plants under its
jurisdiction. Does the ferret disaster,
observers ask, reveal shortcomings
in the act, or in the actions of. the
US. Fish and Wildlife Service and,
other enforcement agencies? These
questions are of particular moment

' this year, because Congress is due to

relmplement the BSA and could
amend it, if need be.

Protection of endangered spe-
cies has been identified in public-

, opinion polls as a high-priority gov-

ernmental obligation. Through in-
cessant press coverage, the black-
footed ferret has become one of the
public’s favorite wild animals; its
popularity, in a sense, is a national
mandate to government to save it.

The ESA assigns ultimate respon-
sibility for endangered species to the
federal government. But the USFWS
can —- and in the ferret’s case did m
assign the lead role to {the state
where the animal lives, in this case
Wyoming. '

The BFAT minutes reveal much
research and managerial effort. But
Clark and USFWS biologist Ron
Crete, an ex-BFAT member, say
there has been a lack of leadership
and clear and meaningful direction.

Others concur. BFAT member
James Turnell. on whose Pitchfork
ranch the ferrets were found in Nice
tectse, declared at one early meet—
ing ”The prehlem is that netted}.
seems it: knew what they want.”

It. what he concedes is kindsght.
Crete said recently in an interview
in Helena, Mont, “I think we abso-
lutely missed the boat. The concept
of critical endangerment was abso-
lutely missed with the ferret.”

A radio collar was placed on the
neck of the first ferret trapped at
Meeteetse, Crete recalled with a
shudder. The collar subjected one of
the few remaining ferrets to addi~
tlonal risk, since the collar might
have caught on a root or chafed the

Coyotes Invading
New York State

Coyote. The word conjures up
images of a wily western animal
scrounging for its meals in a
desert or howling from a butte at
sunset. That western coyote has a
cousin that makes its home in
several populous northeastern
states.

One of the healthiest coyote
p0pulations resides in New York
State, according to Gary Goff, a
wildlife specialist at Cornell Uni-
versity in Ithaca, NY.

“They are all through New
York,” says Goff. “Every county
in the state has a viable, perma-
nent population of coyotes,
except New York City and Long
Island.”

THE PRESENCE of coyotes in
more populous states comes as no
[surprise to Goff, who notes that
the animals make their home
throughout the United States,
with the exception of Hawaii and
some areas of the southeast.

Two theories have emerged to
explain the coyote’s appearance
in New York. The first is that coy-
otes immigrated to New York
from Canada across the frozen
St. Lawrence River. A second

theory postulates that coyotes
were always present in New
York, but their populations were
kept in check by wolves that also
were once present.

While theories about the coy-
ote’s emergence — or re-
emergence —- remain unsettled,
wildlife scientists are in agree-
ment that this complex and con-
troversial animal is in New York
to stay.

NEW YORK State’s Depart-
ment of Environmental Conser-
vation estimates that between
7,000 and 10,000 coyotes now live
in New York, with the densest
populations located in the peri—
phery of the Adirondack Moun-
tains and the St. Lawrence River
plains.

One reason for the coyotes’
abundance is that they are quite
adaptable to conditions, Goff
states.

“They are extreme opportun-
ists,” Goff says. “They will act as
a predator, as a scavenger, and
as a herbivore. As a result, they
are capable of existing in a wide
variety of habitats.”

among some ~80 breeds of livestock

’1 vanishing from American farms,
says a group Working to keep genet-

“Some of the breeds most im-
portant to the development of
American agriculture have slipped

'down to a very few herds and .

. She estimated that at least a
dozen breeds have become extinct
in the past 20 years

The conservancy scheduled a

that about 80 of America’s 160 live—

., stock breeds and 25 of its 60 major

poultry breeds are in trouble.

more milk, but the other breeds re-

quire less care and feeding -— a

' trait that would be lost forever if

they became extinct. .
The rare breeds also provide the

genetic diversity that could ward

“The poultry industry is based on

Orthodontist Makes
Big Cats a Specialty

By ALBERT MAYER

“I ﬁnd it very humbling to look
at a tiger and think nature put
him on earth too,“ says Dr.
Edward V. Shagam. “Tigers are
beautiful animals.”

It is this philosophy which
prompted the 36-year-old ortho-
dontist in Mt. Holly, N.J., to gain
relaxation from his dental prac-
tice by taking on a group of
unusual patients — lions, tigers,
bears and other exotic animals.
Most of them reside at nearby
Great Adventure’s Safari Park.
“Yes,” Dr. Shagham admits,
“there have been a few trying
moments.”

ON ONE occasion a tranquil-
ized_ 350-pound lion opened its
eyes and began roaring. Shagam
beat a hasty retreat. His wife Vic-
ki, who assists him, stood still.
“My feet were frozen to the
ﬂoor,” she says. Happily, the lion
merely waved. a paw and went
back to sleep on the operating
table.

Instruments? The doctor’s
array of dental equipment looks
like a master plumber’s work kit.
It’s homemade. Shagam enjoys
the challenge of fashioning what
is needed. “The procedure for
animals is similar to that for
human beings,” he says. “It’s

 

just that the tools are bigger. .

“You have to be wary of!
bears,” he continues, “because‘
they like to play ‘possum.’ ” To?
treat a giraffe he had to work?
through a second-story window. a

The day after treating Dimitri, \
his favorite tiger, Shagam said
the animal came up and licked
his hand.

False teeth? “No,” Shagam
says, “but I have capped show
animals’ teeth. And I’ve moved
teeth to allow the animals to chew
better.”

‘ CLUES T0 an animal having a
toothache are increased saliva-
tion, favoring a side of the mouth
and eating less. Big cats are a
problem because they turntheir
heads while chewing and shy
away from other animals. All ani-
mals, by instinct, tend to conceal
their pain from possible preda-
tors. “It is contended that ani-
mals feel pain less than
humans,” Shagam says. “I can’t
prove it, but I don’t agree.”

Captive animals, especially big
cats, don’t get enough hard food
to chew, contributing to gum dis-

 

ease. The reason? The public
doesn’t like to see them chewing
bones because “it doesn’t know
whose bones are being chewed,”

 

Shagam adds.

Bald eagle population soars in state

 

By Fred Glrard
News Staff Writer

Michigan’s bald eagle has staged a dra-
matic comeback that has left wildlife experts
crowing with enthusiasm.

A record 125 pairs of bald eagles nested
last year in Michigan and produced 117
young -— another record —— for the threat-
ened bird’s population, according to the
state Department of Natural Resources.

“The population has been increasing
g steadily in recent years,” said DNR non-

game and endangered species coordinator
Bob Hess.

THE EAGLE population’s growth pat-
tern was helped by bans on DDT and certain
other pesticides, Hess said.

“Eagles are primarily fish eaters, and the
pesticides used in the 19603 and 19708
highly contributed to their decline. The

)IDV HHWOO

4 Ban on DDT, other pesticides hailed

population levels then were very low,” Hess
said. “Right now, we’re shooting for a mini-
mum 200 pairs by the turn of the century.”

Sergej Postupalsky, who has studied ea-
gles, ospreys and other birds of prey in
Michigan for the last 17 years, placed the
census of eagle pairs at 126 —- one pair
greater than the DNR count.

“ACTUALLY, 122 pairs nested, and
we had another four pairs where we didn’t
know where their nests were -— or didn’t
have any nests at all,” Postupalsky said.

Postupalsky, a free-lance biologist now
living in Madison, Wis., said the DNR’s
projection of 200 pairs by the end of the
century might be conservative.

“If I had my druthers, I’d have them
shoot for 300,” he said. “Not necessarily by
the end of the century, but I think the
potential for growth is there.”

 

Michigan’s eagle population declined
more rapidly than neighboring states’, Pos-
tupalsky said, because of Michigan’s higher
proportion of Great Lakes shorelines. Levels
of DDT and other contaminants were higher

in Great Lakes fish than ﬁsh from inland
lakes, he said.

“NOW THAT DDT’s use has been
banned for about 12 years, the (eagle)
population has started recovering, and is
slowly reoccupying these breeding territories
that had been abandoned as long as 10 or 20
years,” Postupalsky said.

Bald eagles nested last year on Isle Royals.
in the state’s Upper Peninsula for the ﬁrst,
time since 1966, the DNR said. Eighty-sev-
en of the 125 nesting pairs settled in the,
Upper Peninsula, with most of the rest
found in the north-central and northeastern

t

edges of the Lower Peninsula.

US. Fish and Wildlife Service figures
indicated about 6,000 bald eagles inhabit the
lower 48 states, including 1,600 nesting
pairs. Another 11,000 to 12,000 eagles were
living in Alaska and Canada, figures showed.

The National Wildlife Federation has
said eagle populations would increase more
rapidly if states banned lead shot, which the
federation said can contaminate eagles that
prey on waterfowl that have been shot or
ingested the lead pellets. Lead‘shot poison-

ing ranks behind shootings, collisions with
cars and power-line electrocutions in caus-
ing eagle deaths, the federation said.

Hess said mercury poisoning suffered
from eating contaminated fish probably is
more of a threat to eagles. “That’s why we’re
looking into the aspect of mercury contami-
nation affecting the population,” he said.

Aesoclated Press contributed to this re-
port.

 




The most significant problem is
the public health threat to hu-
mans, especially children. A pack
of dogs, particularly when stimu-
lated by a female in season, have
been known to attack and severely
injure children for no apparent
reason other than the children be-
ing in the dogs’ path.

Where do we place the blame for
this behavior? The dogs? They’re
only doing what their natural in-
stincts tell them to do. The owner
of the female Doberman? After
this episode of canine violence, the

“owner had his Doberman spayed.
However, he exemplified the re-
sponsible pet owner by keeping his
animalvcontained. What about the
owners of the roaming dogs? Defi-
nitely, this is where the finger
should be pointed.

As you mentioned, I wonder how
many were turned out to do their
business and never returned.
Probably, many owners are still
searching for their animals with
the hope of finding them fading
more and more each day. Most
people who turn their pets out into
the neighborhood each morning
and night, supposedly for a short

E frequently hear about our
vanishing wildlife and the
threatened extinction of

dozens of animal species. One of the
major changes on the Texas wildlife
scene in recent years, however, pres-
ents quite the opposite problem. That

change is the importation and prolifer-
ation of exotic big-game animals. A re-
cent survey by the Texas Parks and
Wildlife Department indicates a pop?-
lation'of more than 120,000 of these
“Texotics.” ' , .
It is now possible to watch a herd of
black-and-white striped zebras grazing
with the cattle on a Hill Country ranch.
A motorist who reports seeing a giraffe
looking down at him from over a road-
side fence has not necessarily been nip-
ping at the bottle. Texas is now home
to addax and sable, to scimitar-horned
onyx and kudu and the droll-looking

g Reasons for the introduction of these.
exotic mammals range from attempts
at preservation of endangered species
to the simple desire to have a private
backyard zoo. Several big-game
ranches are open to ‘ the public and
charge admission for a drive—through
tour while also breeding the animals
for sale. Others charge large fees for
hunting. providing a chance to shoot
African or Asian trophies without ven-
turing to those farflung continents.
Because these species are not native
to our state, they are not classified as
“game animals" under Texas law. Ex-
cept for special legislative action, as
with wide-ranging aoudad sheep in the
Panhandle. they are in the same legal
category as domestic livestock.
Long-standing Federal laws, begin-
ning with the Lacey Act in 1900, pre-
vent the direct introduction and release

 

of big-game animals from foreign
countries. Such animals can be impor-

Nearly 100 different species of Texo-
tics can now be found on ranches
across the state, from deep South\
Texas to the Panhandle. and from Big
Bend to the Piney Woods. Texas has
more exotic animals than any other
state. In some cases, populations here
exceed those in the animals’ native
lands.

Latest population estimates, for ex-
ample, include 38.000 axis deer, 10.500
fallow deer and 7,900 sika deer, accord-
ing to Winkler. The beautiful and
graceful blackbuck, originally from In-

game '

dia, now numbers 18,700. Nilgai, large
Indian antelope, roam the brush coun-
try of South Texas. Gemsbok browse
the oaks of the Edwards Plateau.

With some of the imports, of course,
have come their own exotic diseases,
parasites and medical idiosyncrasies,
perhaps to be passed on to domestic
stock or to our native animals. Veteri-
nary research is currently being chan-
neled toward determining the extent of
those problems.

Of concern, too, is the threat of com-
petition with native deer populations.
Many of the exotics are browsers, vy-
ing with deer for the same food sup-
plies. However, they also graze on
range grasses, enabling them to find
forage under almost any conditions and
to compete successfully with both deer
and cattle.

The axis deer, a handsome spotted
Species from India, has virtually wiped
out native white-tailed deer p0pula-
tions in some portions of Bexar and
Bandera counties, according to state
game officials. Certainly this competi-
tion can be expected to intensify as the
exotics continue to multiply.

We still have several times as many
deer in Texas as existed when they
were hunted only by the Indians and by
large predators, and they are not likely
to disappear over a wide area anytime
in the near future. The breeding of ex-
otic animals in captivity also offers
hope in preserving species now threat-
ened by poaching or habitat destruc-
tion intheir native lands. The good
may very well outweigh the bad, espe-
cially if the herds are managed respon-
sibly.

DETROIT NEWS - Feb. 16, 1986

New Videotape strictly for the

 

By Millicent Risen
News Staff Writer

“Squaaawk. Can we talk?”

After Polly spends a few hours
perched in front of a video cassette
recorder, it may be tough to get the
parrot to shut up.

Pet owners now can teach their
birds to talk with $60 videotapes that
use parrots to school their feathered
fellows.

“THIS IS an item that is needed
for the thousands of parrot owners in
America..." says creator Donald Wil-
liams of Roanoke, Va. ’

Instructional tapes on everything
from home improvements to ﬂy fish-
ing are part of the home video boom,
but the parrot cassettes apparently
are the first directed at animals.

Williams experimented with his
own ﬁve chatty parrots to develop the
bird—to-bird teaching methods. His
pets star as the taped teachers, chat-
tering “Let me out” and “I’m a green
chicken.”

“The problem with teaching birds
to talk is that there is no good method
to do it that isn’t very time-consum-
ing and boring” for humans, Williams
says. “After 15 minutes of saying
‘hello’ to a parrot, (humans’) patience
wears out.”

AUDIO TAPES are ten repeti-
tive and lose the birds’ interest, the
Virginian says. “A tape will say, ‘How
are you?’ and two seconds later, ‘How
are you?’ The bird thinks it’s just
another noise in the room” and ig-
nores it, he says.

Williams, who owned a pet shop
before becoming president of a Video
Data Services franchise two years
ago, thought video bird instruction
would ﬂy. He began distributing the
tapes three months ago and says more
than 50 have been sold through mail
orders and pet stores.

“If you traveled to the tropical
jungles, you would see ﬂocks of birds

together, mimicking each other,” says‘

his ad, published in Bird Talk and
American Caged Bird magazines.
“Birds learn faster from other birds.

have another bird do it?”

“gimme a break” — at 15-second
intervals. '

The lessons devote about 12 min-
utes to each phrase, and owners are
instructed to keep replaying each “un:
til your bird has mastered it.” Wil—
liams recommends holding language
classes twice a day.

Depending on the bird’s brain, it
should master the sentence in two
days to two weeks. .

Owners need not hover nearby
while the parrot’s eyes are glued to the
TV screen, Williams says.

Tape buyers get a parchment di-
ploma from the VIT (Video Institute
of Talkology) at no extra charge.

“Something for the ego of the bird ,
, owners,” who can pay at least $500 for

a prized parrot, Williams says.

HE SENDS a BS. degree, for.

bachelor of sayings, with the intro-
ductory tape. A second-level cassette
is accompanied by an MS. —— master
of sentences. '

And soon to come is a tape with a
PhD program (Parrot of Higher Dia—
log). featuring phrases such as
“What’cha doing, huh?” or “Don’t
shake the cage.” That upcoming tape
also will have lessons in singing a
musical scale.

For his next project, Williams

Three veterinarians remain
on call throughout all events

The Houston Livestock Show and
Rodeo is the world’s largest live-
stock show, with competition for

'more than 45 different breeds of

livestock. At any one time, thou-
sands of head of valuable livestock
may be found on the grounds.

Add to this the superbly condi-
tioned animal athletes that are an
integral part of the thrilling rodeo
competition in the Astrodome and
you have an animal population the
size of a small city.

Every animal that enters the
show grounds must possess a valid
animal health certificate showing
that the animal is in good health
and pr0perly vaccinated. Eac‘h ani-
mal is thoroughly checked by the
staff of the Texas Animal Health
Commission before it is granted
permission to enter the exhibition
grounds;

The Houston Livestock show and
Rodeo operates in complete com-
pliance with the animal health reg-
ulations as set down by the State of
Texas and enforced by the Texas
Animal Health Commission.

In addition, the show has three
official veterinarians on call at all

times to attend to any health prob?

lem which might arise in the ani-
mal population. These
veterinarians are all members of
the Texas Veterinary Medical As-

sociation. .

While each is well qualified to
provide any incidental health care
for all the various breeds which
are exhibited here, responsibilities
are split into three primary areas
— livestock show, horse show and
rodeo.

The veterinarian for the live-
stock show is primarily responsible
for dealing with the various cattle,
sheep, swine, poultry and rabbit
breeds here for competition. His
responsibility, like that of his col-
leagues, translates to being on call,
prepared for any emergency, at
any time throughout the run of the
show.

In accordance with American
Horse Show Association regula-
tions, a veterinarian is on call dur-
ing all Class A AHSA sanctioned
horse events.

The Houston Livestock Show and
Rodeo also provides an official far-
rier, ready to tend to any foot care
needs for the more than 3,000
horses shown here each year.

A veterinarian is also in atten-
dance during each rodeo perfor-
mance and during any slack
competition to provide any inci-
dental care for the animals
brought in by rodeo producer Mike
Cervi.

Reply of many states to Montana offer: ‘Thanks, but no thanks’

I

By the Los Angeles Daily News

You see them free in the breeze.
Sometimes ﬂapping with wild
abandonment, the grizzly bears
emblazoning California’s state ﬂag
are about the only ones you will
see outside of a zoo.

All others in California, once
known as the Bear Flag Republic,
were killed by the state’s human
inhabitants more than 60 years
ago. The last one was spotted in
1922.

Montana, the state with one of
the largest populations of grizzlies
with barely 1,000, offered Califor-
nia and other states some of its
grizzly wealth last year. Califor~
nia’s response? A bearish “Thanks,
but no thanks.”

“Relocating problem grizzly
bears into California would present
some serious economic concerns,
as well as a hazard to public safe-
ty,” wrote Eldridge Hunt, chief of
the wildlife management branch of
the state Department of Fish and
Game, when he responded to the
offer.

According to Terry Mansfield, a
wildlife management supervisor,
the department’s attitude toward
. grizzlies is not likely to change this
year, despite renewed efforts by
dauntless Montana officials, who
are making another try at their re-
location offer. .

Other states told Montana bluht-
1y what they thought of the idea.

Alaska officials said they might
consider the grizzly offer “if Mon-
tana would consider a trade of

Alaskan wolves for Montana bears.
Presumably such an exchange
would be made on a pound-for-
pound basis.”

“Oregon has no plans to reintro-
duce grizzlies now or in the future.
We have enough problems with
black bears. Do you want any
black bears?” one official wrote
back to Montana.

“It would take more than an act
of God for Utah to accept a ‘good’

grizzly bear,” wrote a bureaucrat

there.

Officials in New Mexico declined
the offer, but suggested that Mon-
tana contact Mexico about the pro-

am.

Colorado replied with “its Oppo-
sition to every person or entity
which may now or in the future
suggest or plan the reintroduction
of . . . the grizzly bear.”

Clearly, the grizzly, which has
been known to attack humans, has
not made many friends.

Yet the creature, which can
grow to weigh 1,000 pounds, does
have some supporters.

The Montana-based Great Bear
Foundation claims a small but pas~
sionate membership of 500 devoted
to the preservation of grizzlies.

The rejection of Montana’s relo-
cation offer comes as no surprise
to Lance Olsen, the organization’s
president.

“The response was predictable,”
Olsen said.

However, he believes the atti-
tude among wildlife officials will
change if the public demonstrates

a desire to foster. grizzly reintro-
duction.

The federal government is an
example of that change, Olsen
said. “They were once charged
with trying to eliminate grizzlies;

. now they are trying to save them,” .

Olsen said.

But it is too late to save the griz:
zlies in California.

David McRill, a Quincy resident,
expressed his feelings in a letter to
Olsen. “The grizzly bear is Califor-
nia’s state animal. 1 find it ironic
that a zoo is the only place we can

ob..;:a'=:"ve this majestic creature in.

the estate.”
Juhn Fredricks, a North Holly-

womi electrician who is a member-

of the Great Bear Foundation, said
grass-roots support is the only way
to Six-ﬂy state officials toward ac-
CBplliig some grizzlies for reintro-
duction in California.

While California’s grizzlies are
gone, plenty of black bears remain.

It is quiet under the blankets of
snow where bears are quietly pass-
ing away the weeks of winter. But
in the warmth of office buildings,
the black bears’ greatest predator
is drawing plans that will awake in
a few months.

Buried away in dens from the
San Bernardino Mountains to the
Sierra Nevada, the population of
black bears, the state’s only breed
of bear, is approximately 15,000,
and the state’s Fish and Game
Commission intends to keep it that
way. Hunting is permitted between
mid-October and late December
each year.

It is an uneasy relationship be-V
tween men and animals, one that
sometimes spills blood. .

Last year, after the hibernation
was over, a black bear began hang—-
ing around various parts of Frazier
Park, north of the San Fernando
Valley.

One night in May, a local res1-
dent spotted the bear going
through a garbage can. The man
slugged the bear with a board, and
the bear shinnied up a nearby tree.
Onlookers arrived. So did the po-
lice and Kern County animal con-
trol officers.

All the attention and the blow to
the head had put the bear in a un-
comfortable mood.

Officials decided to tranquilize
the bear, but also made plans to
shoot it if it descended into the
gathering crowd. When it was hit
by a tranquilizer dart, the bear de—
cided it had had enough and start.-
ed to leave.

Officials then shot it. The bear
died, and a community uproar be-

n.

Mansfield said a follow-up inves-
tigation determined that the offi-
cials who killed the bear took ap—
propriate action.

“You try to save the bear, but
not every situation , works out the
best,” Mansfield admitted. .

He said the best policy for deal~
ing with bears is to respect them -
and enjoy them from a distance.
“Bears and man just don’t mix,”
he said.

Doberman
saves tot
from snake

General, a rambunctious, 18-month-
old Doberman pinscher, is being hailed
as a here today after saving a toddler
from a c0pperhead.

The Tuesday episode at the Humble
home of Darrel and Candy Gaudin was
the second time in little more than a
year that General rescued a child from
a snake, Mrs. Gaudin said.

The incident occurred shortly after
noon as Kenny Gaudin, 14 months, and
his sister. Sarah, 5, played in the back
yard of their parents’ home in the Fox-
wood subdivision, five miles from
Humble.

Mrs. Gataiin, alerted by Kenny’s cry-
ing and neral’s furious barking,
found the add sprawled face-down
near a woonpile. The child’s head was
less than two inches from the logs, she
said.

“General was digging under the
wood with his paws and barking,” she
said. The worried mother snatched the
boy from the ground. Seconds later,
General burrowed beneath the logs and
returned with a wildly wriggling 18-
inch-long c0pperhead.

When General drapped the reptile,
Mrs. Gaudin beat it to death with a
rake.

A similar incident occurred slightly
more than a year ago when General
attacked a c0pperhead coiled near Sa-
rah’s tricycle seconds before she would
have stepped on the reptile.

General was a gift to the Gaudin
family from Mrs. Gaudin’s mother,
Jean Henley.

! Who knows where termites lurk? '
The beagle hose

By TERESA CARP
Christian Science Monitor

obert Outman, a former po- '

lice officer who once

trained canines to detect
narcotics and explosives, has now
turned his dogs on termites.

He uses teams of beagles to fer-
ret out the pests that find dining on
wooden structures so delectable.
Each year, Americans across the
country spend more than $1 billion
to repair damage done by ter-
mites.

Like those millions of others,
Outman found out about this prob-
lem the hard way. He bought a
home that was certified as termite
free. But in repairing a squeaky
step, he discovered a thriving nest
of the insects. He also discovered
that the original inspector was not
liable for damages. Standard in-
spection contracts exempt opera-
tors from responsibility for struc-
tural areas considered
inaccessible. Depending on the
type of construction, this can
range from 50 to 80 percent.

Instead of simply brooding over
the problem, Outman saw a mar—
ket for a better technology for pest
inspection. Applying his expertise
as an animal behaviorist, he con-
ditioned and trained male beagles
to track down termites and car-
penter ants. In 1979 he set up shop
with only a few beagles.

Business is now booming for
.Outman’s TADD Services Corpo—
ration of Belmont, Calif. (TADD
stands for termite and ant detec-
tion dogs). Business volume dou-
bles yearly, and TADD leases 30
trained beagles to pest-control
companies in major cities around
the nation.

After extensive research, Out-
man chose male beagles because
they are tractable and intelligent;
have an acute sense of hearing and
smell; and are small enough to get

into crawl spaces. It’s the dogs
keen sense of smell and hearing
that alerts them to where the ter-
mites are. The more termites
there are, the more active the bea-
gles become, “digging” excitedly
at the pinpointed location. (They
all get regular pedicures to keep
their nails rounded so that no dam-
age is done to indoor floors.)

The program has undergone
thorough testing at Ohio State Uni-
versity, where his dogs were certi-
fied as detectors of both dry and ’
subterranean termites. The canine
crews also are recognized by the
National Pest Control Association
as a useful industrial tool, and the
results of the dogs’ findings are ad- '
missible as evidence in litigation
over termite damage.

Outman is so confident in the
abilities of his four-legged inspec-
tors that each carries $1 million in
errors-and-omissions insurance.
“They’re the only animals in the "“
world that have malpractice insur-
ance,” he says. To date he has had
only one claim.

Outman, who did graduate work
in animal behavior, was a member
of the dog handler and trainer unit

of the San Mateo County (Calif)
Sheriff’s Department for 11 years.
Because of this law enforcement
tie he was eligible for a federal
grant, enabling him to study at the
military dog training school at
Lackland Air Force Base in San

Antonio. After this training, he
and his dog Prince were two-time
gold medal winners in the dog pa-
trol competition at the California
state police Olympics. In 1976, Out-
man was forced into early retire—
ment because of gunshot wounds
received in the line of duty.

Now that his current business is
on a firm footing, he and his corps
of canine inspectors have become

minor celebrities, appearing on
television talk shows and receiv-
ing fan mail.

But in the beginning, fans were
few and far between. The pest-con-
trol industry “initially treated the
new concept as a big joke,” he re-
calls. “We’d gone to a lot of trou-
ble developing the first really new
and effective technology of inspec-
tion since the invention of the
flashlight andscrewdriver, and
the professionals just laughed at
us.” The laughing soon stopped
when the dogs repeatedly proved
their effectiveness, not only on the
job, but in field trials overseen by
university entomologists and in-
dustry consultants.

Details of the conditioning and
training program are a closely
guarded trade secret. Outman
himself breeds some of the dogs,
.and he works with certain breed-
ers to obtain others. Conditioning
begins at the tender age of five
weeks. Training continues for nine
to 10 months, depending on the in-

dividual dog’s maturity. When a

dog is considered ready to work in ‘

the field, it is placed with a pest-
control firm on a year-to-year
lease.

The dog’s handler also must un-
dergo intensive training. To en—
sure that TADD dogs are used and

treated properly, Outman or one of 0};

his quality-control inspectors vis-
its each one every 45 to 60 days.
Outman himself ﬂies about 200,000
miles a year in placing and check-
‘ing on the dogs. As an added ele-
ment of quality control, sometimes
his visits are unannounced.

A dog and handler team can in-
spect eight to 10 average homes a
day, at an average cost of $150, 50
percent more than a routine hu-
man inspection. Since the dogs
find virtually all live infestations,
Outman contends, the additional
expenditure is well justified. ‘
TADD dogs can reportedly find
nests containing as few as eight
live termites.

The new technology is not com- .
pletely without its drawbacks. The.
dogs don’t find damage in the ab-
sence of live termites and ants.
Moreover, there is some: :sncern

esearchers Seek
Alternatives To
Lab-Animal Tests

. WASHINGTON (AP) — A growing

number of American researchers are
’ trying to minimize pain and suffering
. of laboratory animals and to reduce
their use by developing alternatives
involving computers, according to a
congressional study.

But the study concludes that lab-
oratories will continue for quite some
time to sacrifice millions of animals
each year for everything from study-

ing cancer to testing cosmetics. The-

study was made public Saturday.

‘ The Office of Technology Assess-
",ment spent more than two years and
$425,000 studying animal use in scien-
tific research, product testing and
education. The office is the scientific
advisory arm of Congress.

' It found that, while exact figures
are hard to come by, at least 17 mil-
lion to 22 million animals were used
in US. research and testing in 1983,
the latest year for which information
was available. Many animal welfare
advocates say the figure is far higher
— some say as many as 70 million —
but the technology office could find
no basis for that figure.

By far the bulk of the animals are
rats and mice. Dogs, cats, rabbits,
guinea pigs, hamsters, birds, fish, am-
phibians and primates probably
make up less than one-third of the
total, the study says.

The animals are used widely in
medical research into conditions
from AIDS to leprosy and from bald-
ness to menopause, and in behavioral
research to study things like learning,
social activity and emotions.

In product testing, several million
animals a year are used to determine
whether substances about to go on the
market are toxic, irritating or other-
wise likely to cause harm to their
human users.

And in education, animals are used
for everything from pets for pre-
schoolers to dissection subjects for
medical and veterinary students.

While it is proceeding slowly, the
search for alternatives to using ani-
mals in the laboratory is being pro-
pelled by several factors, said Gary
Ellis, the analyst for the technology
office who directed the research
project.

For one thing, the use of animals
can be expensive and labor intensive,
and technological advances in com-
puter and biotechnology are making
possible cheaper and simpler alterna-
tives. Some government regulatory
agencies, whose requirements are the
reason for much product testing, are
willing to accept the data from alter-
nate sources, Ellis said.

In addition, there has been in-
creased opposition to animal use by
animal welfare groups. The opposi-
tion has generated much attention
from the press.

Also, Congress passed a stronger

version of the 1966 Animal Welfare.

Act in December. Among other pro-
tective measures, it calls for re—
searchers to carefully exhaust alter-
natives before turning ts animals as
experimental subjects.

“I would say that in toxicity testing
there’s a serious potential for a re-
duction in the numbers of rodents
used, perhaps as soon as within five
years,” Ellis said.

For example, one widely used test

that has required the use of as many '

as 100 rats or mice to determine the
lethal dose of certain substances has
been refined to use only one-third
that many animals. Also, an alterna-
tive is being developed to the widely
criticized test in which foreign matter
is applied to rabbits’ eyes to deter-
mine its irritancy.

Alternatives like models and com-
puter simulations may take‘the place

of the familiar high school biology

dissection of frogs, although medical
and veterinary schools contend that
they still need to use animals to edu-
cate their students.

Feb. 22, 1986

a imals for research

By MiCHAEL DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

Clay County on Friday joined Du-
vall County in suspzi iing the dona-
tion of pound animals for research
at the University of Florida.

That leaves Hillsborough County
as the only remaining Florida
county to continue the practice, and
at present there is no plan to discon-
tinue using local pound animals for
medical research at the University
of South Florida in Tampa, said
Hillsborough County Public Safety
Director Gil Rodriguez.

“There was a lot of correspond-
ence received (from animal rights
groups) four or five months ago by

earlier, said Animal Control Direc-

versity of South Florida obtains
1,200 to 1,300 animals per year from
the pound.

Gorman declined to give his
opinion of the practice, but he did
say he believes the USF researchers
are not torturing the animals.

“I’ve been out to the university a

Rhinoceros horns,
sought by poachers,
command more than
$30,000 a pound.

KAZIRANGA, India — At dusk, a
pinpoint of light shines from inside
the forest. Slowly the light gets
closer to reveal a jeep full of hunt-
ers, returning to camp with their

Until five years ago, the demand
for rhinoceros horns could be met
by stealing horns from animals that

. had died naturally. In 1980, the prob-

lem here surged as more and more
places made the sale of rhino horns
illegal.

By the middle of last month,
rangers had already found 34 dead
rhinos with their horns removed, al-
most as many as the record 37 found
in Kaziranga in 1983. . ,

Nevertheless, the population of
rhinos in the Kaziranga preserve has
increased from 939 in 1978, and
some naturalists think there are
enough to start transporting extra
rhinos to other national parks in

India.

In 1984, in an effort to preserve
the species by spreading its habitat,
the Indian government ﬂew five
rhinos from Kaziranga to another
park in northern India, where
poaching might be less of a threat.

Two of the five transported
rhinos eventually died, but the gov-
ernment regarded the experiment
as a success.

porter, he and some others pro-
ceeded to kick and beat the suspects
in the course of their interrogation.

This place is the rhinoceros capi-
tal of the world. Kaziranga National
Park, just south of the Brahmaputra
River in the remote northeastern In-
dian state of Assam, has 1,080
rhinoceroses — a bigger concentra-
tion than any single territory, includ-
ing'those in Africa. _

Once the species known as the
great Indian one-horned rhinoceros
roamed all across the grasslands of
the Indo—Gangetic plain. Today the
animal is endangered here, as else-
where, because of encroaching
population grth and poachers.

The poachers are after the
rhino’s famous horn, which millions
of Asians, particularly Chinese living
in Southeast Asia, continue to prize
for its legendary but scientifically
unproved powers as an aphrodisiac.

Looking for poachers is a frus-
trating occupation. Some 100 men
patrol the 270—square-mile preserve,
searching for footprints and telltale
signs of pits dug in the ground and
camouflaged to trap the unsuspect-
ing beasts.

Meanwhile, the poachers stalk
the same territory, looking for signs
of the rangers. Encounters often
lead to shootouts.

“Usually we shoot at them and
they shoot at us and they run away
and nothing happens,” said P.C. Das,
the chief conservator in Assam.

Das said the government had
thought of looking for poachers

aboard airplanes, helicopters or bal-
loons. “But it's like what the Amer-
icans discovered in Vietnam,” he ex-
plained. “If there is ground cover,
the poachers will be able to hide in
‘t!’

From atop the park’s trained ele-
phants, visitors can observe the
rhinos grazing, often with an egret
on their back. The rhinos are docile,
although males occasionally attack
each other over a female, and a
mother will sometimes charge some-
thing — or someone — she feels is
threatening her calf.

Laden with their passengers, the
elephants clump through the grass-
lands in their search. But once
found, the rhinoceroses stare up at
the visitors, looking bored and unim-
pressed.

It is an almost impossible task to
keep intruders from coming into this
huge area. There are no fences to
keep them out, as nearby farmers
who sometimes encounter rhinocer-
oses and elephants on their land can
attest.

The rangers have spread an in-
telligence network through the. sur-
rounding villages in hope of hearing
when a poaching party enters.
Today’s batch was pursued and
‘caught after a tip-off.

The poachers had expensive-
looking yur—lined nylon jackets and
waterprbof rations of food, reflect-
ing the lucrativeness of their work.

The poachers themselves may
get only $200 for making a trip into

the sanctuary. But Das said rhinoc-
eros horns — which are actually
lumps of matted hair —- command
more than $30,000 a pound. An aver-
age hom weighs more than a pound
and a half.

The biggest marketplace for
rhino horns is Singapore, which has
declined to sign the worldwide cove-
nant that bans the sale of products of
endangered species, Das said.

Taking Care
Of Animals’ Eyes

Wearing a white, sterile robe
and a dangling stethoscope,
the hard-working doctor
peers into a patient’s eye
through a special micro-
scope. But it is not a human
eye and the physician is
not your run-of-the-mill
ophthalmologist either. Be-
hind all that medical para‘
phernalia is, an animal lover,
Dr. Gail Powell, who prac-
tices her medical specialty on
animals only.

Powell has established
herself, in four years, as the
only veterinary eye specialist
in the Atlanta area. She
works primarily with domes-
tic pets and treats them for a
variety of eye problems from
glaucoma to cataracts. Occa-
sionally though, Powell is
contacted by the Atlanta Zoo
for consultation on animals
such as aardvarks, elephants
and even lions.

hard initially to establish her
business.

“When I moved here I had
mixed emotions that it
wouldn’t work because I was
the new kid on the block, or
because I wasn’t a Georgia

graduate, or I was a woman,
or whatever else,” Powell
says. “But other profession-
als, other veterinarians, were
very receptive to me and said
they needed somebody here
because they were always
having to refer their clients to
the University of Georgia
where it was so far away to
drive.”

Currently, Powell works at
the Atlanta Veterinary Clinic
in Avondale Estates where
she sees between 15 and 20
patients a week. She also
teaches at Oglethorpe.

She says that during the
time she was deciding on a
specialty, she experimented
with several disciplines within
the field of veterinary medi-
cine, including orthopedic
and cardiovascular surgery.
But when she began studying
the eye, her decision came
almost instantaneously.

“I found it was wonderful
working in all those different
eyes,” she says. “It was just
such a beautiful specialty
with all the different colors.”

PEOPLE WEEKLY
Feb. 24, 1986

Who’s black and white and read
about all over? Fred, the portly puss of
Woodbury, Conn., is who. When kindly
librarians let the shivering stray in from
the cold 10 years ago, they never
dreamed they were setting the stage
for a contemporary cat controversy.

The fur began to fly in November
1984 when Woodbury resident Phyllis
Delaney wrote to First Selectman Eliz-
abeth A. Adams complaining that
Fred’s presence in the public library
made it impossible for her to use the
facility. Along with allergies and asth-
ma, Delaney suffers from ailurophobia,
a debilitating fear of felines. The very
sight of a cat, says Delaney, “makes
me hyperventilate and then become
practically catatonic.”

To mollify Delaney, a sympathetic li-
brary board came up with a list of op—
tions—such as keeping Fred out of the

way when Delaney came to the library
or sending books directly to her home.
All were categorically unacceptable to
Delaney, whose letter-writing cam-
paign eventually extended to the Gov-
ernor’s office. Meanwhile, media cov-
erage across the country catapulted
Fredfwho happens to be a female, to
national celebrity.

While Delaney has been vilified by
cat-loving neighbors(“l feel like Karen
Silkwood,” she says), Fred has gar-
nered support from near and far. More
than 150 townspeople signed a petition
to keep her in the library. “Library cats
unite!” wrote Bookums, the resident fe-
line at the nearby Windsor Locks library,
in one of the several dozen letters Fred
has received. Through it all, the object
of the controversy, whose sole respon-
sibility is to keep a lid on the black crick-

ets which gnaw On book bindings, has

remained calm. “That is one laid-back
cat,” says a library patron.

Late last month the Woodbury Li-
brary Board, after ascertaining that
there was nothing illegal about a cat
being kept in the public library, voted
to let Fred stay. Overwhelmed by the
public caterwauling her stand created,
Delaney may have given up the fight. “l
have read that the Woodbury library is
one of the best in the state,” she wrote
in her last letter to the local paper. “I’ll
never know.” Selectman Adams, who
has four cats of her own, admits it
wasn’t an easy‘decision, but Fred’s
popularity among the children and
adults who use the library tipped the
scales. Says Adams: “We were weigh-
ing the benefits to many people

It is sad, but true, that there are times when a

Because of the pet overpopulation in this country,

appreciated, but it would be a greater service to the

SpeCia

needs helpers
in pet program

 

By BRENDA BEUST SMITH
Houston Chronicle '

 

Special Pals staffers have
plenty of pets and plenty of
' community sites begging for
visits. All they need are more
trained volunteers.

The use of pets, primarily
dogs and kittens, in a variety of
therapy situations is an ac-
cepted practice on the East and
- West coasts. And .it’s catching
on fast in Houston.

Judy Hall, humane education
director for the group, has more
than 100 requests from nursing
3 homes, special education clas-
ses and other schools wanting
.‘ the animals and volunteers to
visit. But each visit requires
three volunteers, which spreads
the current trained force of 12
rather thin.

One training session has just
been completed. Two new train—

ing sessions will start at the end
of the month:

Wednesday-March 26: Wed—
nesdays 2-3 pm, and

Thursday-March 27: Thurs-
days 7-8 pm.

Volunteers do not do any spe-
cific therapy on their own.
Rather, they work with thera-
pists or other persons in charge
at the various facilities. Often
they simply encourage those
they visit to pet and talk with
the animals, setting up a re-
laxed, positive atmosphere in
which therapy is more produc-
tive.

Hall would like to see more
professionals take the course. It
is open to those who simply
want to learn more about ani-
mal-assisted therapy, yet not
become a volunteer.

There is a $20 fee for the
training program. Additional in-
formation is available from
Hall at 666-3515.

LOS ANGELES TIMES MAGAZINE - February 16, 1986

laze is, in every way I
know of, a satisfacto-
ry—which is to say a play-
ful and pigheaded—pig.
The poet Fred Lape says,
“Nothing can make a pig
look sad; his face / is built
wrong for it.” The poem
goes on to say that “the
soil’s good humor runs in-
side his veins” and “Maybe
the earth herself had a
good belly laugh/ the era
that she first gave birth to
pigs.” I happen to know
this isn’t so. Pigs can look
ill-tempered, depressed
and tired; they can suffer
and show it. But satisfacto-
ry pigheadedness entails a
pig’s living up to the way
the eyes and mouth form a
grin, and the way the nose
wrinkles, as with laughter,
with every move the pig
makes. This Blaze does. It
isn’t Blaze that is unsatis-
factory, it’s civilization.
Caleb Trainer had always
wanted a pet, but he’s aller-
gic to every form of dander
that nature and man have
come up with. Pigs, howev-
er, aren’t allergenic. And
there was a book—there is

The reading experience,

The difficulty with the
civilized world is that it is
the wrong size for pigs, al-
though it’s about right for
piglets. Caleb had been
looking for a rum and
found one. The farmer who
sold it to him responded to
Caleb’s worry about the po-

tential size of Blaze by sug-
gesting that a shot of

This didn’t work. Bertie
said: “We gave that up in
two or three weeks. They
grow a bit every day, and
you notice this right off.”
Caleb said: “He’s playful
and, you know, pigheaded.

When he found our hard-

a good speed, set himself,

and ski on them.

“Also, he likes to take

This changed things be-
cause “he became uncom-

After that, he felt that the

point, because the usual re-

Martin’s concern is the dog’s age,

has seen time and again, “many
people on impulse take something

eputy dogs
put their noses '

to the grindstone

By Christine Thrash

Spock! to The Tribune

Emma and Solo are sworn
deputies with the Contra Costa
County Sheriff’s Department.

“2 They don’t wear uniforms so
they wear their deputy star
badges on their harnesses.

., Solo, 3 large, golden 6-year-
éld bloodhound, and his handler,
Judy, helped the police in their
recent 12-day manhunt for mur-
der suspect Richard Goodfellow
in Concord and Walnut Creek.

Deputy bloodhound Emma, 7,
who is about a third of 8010’s
size, has worked with her han-
dler, Beverly, on many cases
With Solo in Contra Costa Coun-
ty.
There are seven deputized
bloodhounds who, with their han-
dlers, are volunteers with the
Contra Costa sheriff’s Search
and Rescue Squad. They search
for missing children and adults,
find the scenes of crimes, and
locate evidence.

Because the dogs are friendly
animals and would just as soon
give a slobbery kiss to a suspect
they find, bloodhounds are not
used for crowd control or attack
purposes. That work is left to the
German shepherds in the sher-
iff’s Canine Unit.

Beverly and Judy have been
search-and-rescue volunteers
for eight years. Judy is the
bloodhunt unit leader and the
two women asked that their last
names not be used to protect
their privacy and the dogs’ safe-
ty.
The women admit they “bul-
lied” their way into law enforce-
ment. They both began raising
bloodhounds for show 21 years
ago and had met at dog shows
over the years.

Each of the women had inde-
pendently concluded that the
dogs’ capabilities were being
wasted, so they read everything
available about bloodhounds in
law enforcement. They began

training their dags to trail and
Beverly took a class from a pro-
fessional trainer. .

Word got around about what
the two were doing, and in 1977,
Judy got a call from the publici-
ty person for the sheriff’s
search-and-rescue unit asking if
they would give a demonstration
for the group.

The day after their appear-
ance, they were called in to as-
sist with a search for a 21-year-
old suicidal patient missing
from the county hospital in Mar-
tinez.

“If it hadn’t been for Sheriff
Richard Rainey, the unit
wouldn’t have gotten off the
ground. He backed us 100 per-
cent,” said Judy. .

As far as she knows, Contra
Costa was the first county in Cal-
ifornia to use bloodhounds on a
regular patrol basis. '

“The deputies are wonderful
to work with. Sheriff Rainey is
unusual in that he‘ is a strong
believer in civilian help,” Judy
said.

Beverly’s first trained dog,
Eli, and Judy’s dog, Pita, were
two of the first three deputized.
bloodhounds in California. When
the dogs died, the Contra Costa
Sheriff’s Department retired
their badges with formal cere-
monies. Emmais Eli’s daughter
and Solo is Pita’s grandson.

The bloodhound unit’s first
major case was in November of
1978 when a woman was raped
and murdered at the Lafayette
Reservoir. A nine-hour search
ended when Judy and Pita were
called in to assist. Pita found the
woman’s body in 21 minutes.

Emma and Solo started their
training when they were 3
months old. Although the dogs
are born with instinctive hunting
skills, it takes time to train the
handlers to work with the dogs.

Judy and Beverly say that
their relationship with their dogs
is the same as between any law
enforcement partners. It is not
iust a pet-master relationship.

“There is total trust between
the dog and handler,” said Judy.
“We work in dangerous situa-
tions together.”

“A bloodhound is sort of like
an instrument,” added Beverly.
“We ‘read’ them by the way they
carry their heads or pull on the
leadf’

Unfortunately, because blood-
hounds are a giant dog breed,
they are not long-lived, often
dying by age 6 or 7. Judy and
Beverly were overwhelmed with
grief when their first dogs died.

“It was just like losing a part-
ner and friend,” they said. Both
women are training younger
dogs so they will be prepared for
the sad but foreseeable day
when Emma and Solo will no
longer be able to work.

“The dogs love their work,”

said Judy. When she has to at-
tend a meeting in uniform with-
out Solo, she locks him in anoth-
er room while she gets dressed.

.“If he sees me in uniform, he

the wall and try to climb into it,”
she said.

Bloodhounds seem to view

, trailing as a game, but finding a
; corpse may be traumatic. Ac-
cording to the handlers, the dogs

get very upset when they find a
, dead body.

“They are so depressed after-
ward. We have to hug them and
tell them over and over again
that they did a good job,” said
Judy. ‘

They are extremely happy
when they find someone alive,
said Beverly.

Judy and Beverly said that
their hardest case was the
search for the 5-year-old Anti—
och girl who was reported miss-
ing in November 1983. Many
days searching ended in heart-
break when her body was found.

They recalled a challenging
search up and down Mt. Diablo
trailing an 80-year-old woman.

“She led us on a merry chase,”
said Judy. “It was extremely
cold and windy and the dogs and
handlers walked over the moun-
tain following her trail. She had
gone up to Mitchell Canyon and

f turned to go back home when we
found her near a trail.”

She was just starting to go into

' hypothermic shock when she

was found. “I don’t see how she
made it, it almost killed me”
said Beverly. ’
While some people think
bloodhounds are ugly because
they have drooping ears, wrin-
kled faces and heavy folds over

 




their eyes, those features have

benefits for -the dog.

The loose skin protects them
from brambles and thorns which
would pierce the flesh of a sleek-
er dog. When the bloodhound
lowers its head, rolls of skin cov-
er its eyes. This covering pro—
tects the eyes from sharp objects
along the trail as they search.

In ancient times, other work-
ing dogs wore huge collars stud-
ded with metal prongs to protect
their jugular veins from attacks
by wolves and other predators. A
bloodhound has built-in protec-
tion with its layers of dr00py
skin hanging below its neck.

A predator instinctively goes
for an aminal’s throat, but all
they get when they attack a
bloodhound is a mouthful of skin.

Most of the volunteers on the
sheriff’s Search and Rescue
Squad work full-time at other
jobs. They take time off from
work when they are called out on
a case.

Beverly’s arrangement with
her boss is that she only goes on
searches which may save a life
during her working hours.

Sheriff’s Sgt. Tom Coggins, co-
ordinator of volunteer services,
said that last year the search-
and-rescue volunteers donated
more than 7,500 hours. Other
volunteer units in the sheriff’s
department include a four-wheel
drive team, and squads of medi-
cal personnel, divers, and eques-
trians. Volunteer hours totaled
29,000 hours for all units.

' “We don’t have to do any re-
cruiting because of our reputa-
tion,” said Coggins. He regards
his job as positive because he
deals with “happy groups,”
which he finds a refreshing
change after 16 years in law en-
forcement on the “negative
side.”

Some of the volunteers are re-
serve deputies who are author-
ized to carry weapons. In crimi-
nal cases, a reserve deputy
armed with a gun accompanies
the bloodhound unit.

The volunteer teams work in
Contra Costa, but they are also
called to other counties and even
other states when their help is
needed. They have received na-
tional recognition for their work.

Peggy Henderson looks at pictures of her dog, Bo

Staff Writer

LUCAS —- A few Sundays ago, the pas-
tor at Lucas Christian Church asked his
congregation to keep an eye out for Bo.

By now, just about everybody in the
3,200-member community east of Plano
is on the lookout for Bo - a 50-pound
Belgian Sheepdog whose disappearance
last month has prompted an unusual and
determined search by his owners.

Peggy and Bill Henderson have distrib-
uted hundreds of fliers and pictures of
the long-haired black dog in police sta-
tions, schools, churches and other places
throughout North Texas.

They have called every animal groomer
~and veterinarian in McKinney, Plano,
Carrollton, Addison, Wylie, Allen and
Garland. They have handed out fliers to
hundreds of area schoolchildren. They
have run ads in eight newspapers.

They have spent evenings going door to
door and weekends combing the woods

And they have offered a $500 reward.

“I made a huge effort. It took me days
and days,” Bill Henderson said. “I got a

went down the line and called everyone I
could. I would have done more, but I had
to get a stopping place or I would have . ‘.
pulled out the World Atlas.”

The Hendersons have made the effort I
because, to them, B0 is not just a dog.

“It’s like having another person, anoth- ‘
er child," Peggy Henderson said. “He’s
part of the family. I don’t want to ever
think I gave up on B0."

The search began when Bo slipped out
an open gate in the Hendersons’ back—
yard. Over the past few weeks, they have ,
received dozens of tips from four coun-'
ties, but none have panned out.

“There aren't many dogs like this

‘ Grievingfriend

Bachelor loses beloved dogs in ﬁre

By TOM BOON-E
Staff Writer

Gordon Kelly plays the ﬂash-
light around the blackened mess
that was his home. The carpet
still squishes underfoot. Every-
where are the signs of disaster,
from the charred grandfather
clock lying in the living room to
the heart-wrenching spot on the
bedroom floor.

“It was a beautiful home,” Kel-
ly says in a clear, resonant voice.
“You can’t tell it now, but it was
beautiful.” The fire is now more
than a month old. The memories,
he says, are like yesterday.

“'A friend of mine said, ‘Well,
thank goodness the crystal and
the china weren’t damaged,’ ”
Kelly says. “I said the ﬁre could
have taken everything if it had
just left me my two little dogs.”

For Kelly, a 55-year-old bache-
lor who lived alone in the three-
bedroom brick house, the dogs
were like children: Pepe and
Chiquita, tan and white chihua-

 

 

huas he bought eight years ago.

“They greeted me when I came E91,;

home. They were always so glad
to see me. They ate before I did.
They slept with me.” His voice
breaks. “Excuse me,” he said, “I
guess I’m still not over it.”

The fire struck the Casa View
house on Jan. 24, while Kelly
was on his way home from work
at Gaston Episcopal Hospital,
where he is business manager.
He saw the smoke from his car.
By the time he arrived, the fire
department had the ﬂames un-
der control.

“But did my dogs get out?” he
asked. Someone remembered
seeing the dogs run out of the

house and out of the yard. Kelly

says he felt some relief and be-
gan looking for them. ' ,

He didn’t find either one. “The
little girl dog had run back in
and had hid under my bed,” he
says. “She died of smoke inhala-
tion. The fire department found -
her in there. The little boy dog ,

just ran off. I don’t know where
he is.”

Kelly has cirCulated about 50
posters, some tacked to utility
poles and others hung in restau-
rants and other businesses. They
offer a reward for Pepe’s return
and show a picture of the little
dog.

“I was home at noon that day
and, you know, when I got ready
to go back to work, the little girl

in Kelly’s voice. “And she did too.”
Kelly swung his flashlight beam
across the front of a badly burned
piano. “That’s a player piano,” he
says. “I guess I put about 2,000
hours restoring it.” Across the
room was a player pipe organ, not
quite so badly damaged. Some of it
might be salvageable, he said. Oth-
erwise, practically everything else

of value in the house is so much
wet, smoky trash.

“You never think that someone

could be the happiest person in the
world one moment and then, in
the next, lose everything,” Kelly
says. “Of couse I still have my

The folks facing the bulls in the ring are
not protected by any force other than their
own sklll and experience. If blood spills on
the sands of the dome, it will be theirs.
“Bloodless fights are harder, much
harder,” said Diego O’Bolger, one of three
profess10nal bullfighters from the United
States who will participate in next week-
end’s Astrodome fights. “The hull is not
weakened in any way as he would be in
normal ﬁghts and therefore is not slowed
down and remains strong during the whole
fight. All the danger is on the bullfighter.”
Q Bolger, originally from Tucson, Hous-
ton s own professional bullfighter, 23-year-
old DaVld Renk, and the only professional
woman matador in the history of orga-
mzed bullfighting, Raquel Martinez of San
Diego, have been in town visiting schools
and talking to clubs, trying to drum up
mterest in the bullfights.
“ .Renk, who lives in Tomball, has fought
. five to seven times a year” since achiev-
lng professional status in 1981. Now mar-
ried and father of an infant son, Renk said
he is having to defer pursuing bullfighting
fulltlme until he can get his family settled.

Times have been hard recently for the
136 or so registered professional matadors
on the Mexican circuit. Costs are high,
0 Bolger said, and promoters will sponsor
only one or two fights for a festival or
samt’s day where they used to have four
or five.

“On any given Sunday, there will he,
say, 15 positions to fight in Mexico and
there are 135 or 136 of us registered as
professmnal fighters. And there is a lot of
pohtlcs involved just in getting fights. It is
so expensiye to raise a fighting bull, you
spend four years feeding him expensive
grams. Bullfighting is such a closed world
and the promoters will say ‘Why should I
give a chance to a foreigner when I can
glve it to one of my own countrymen?’ ”

But facing prejudice as a foreigner is
nothing compared to the opposition faced
by Martinez because she is a woman.

“Men seem to think it is harder fighting
with me, but we each have our own turns
and we all do our best with it,” she said.
“One time I fought with a Spanish mata-
dor in Chihuahua who failed in the kill 25
times and the people still applauded. Then
I missed three times and people were yell-
ing ‘Oh, blondie, go back to the kitchen.’ It
is harder for me. I can’t take a step back
or make any mistakes or the crowd notices
more. But it makes me try to be even
better. We each have our own turn at win-
ning our applause. If you do well the peo—
ple will applaud you whether you’re man
or woman.”

Martinez is the very first woman —— ever
— to pass her aIternativa, a kind of rite of
initiation, to become a recognized profes-
sional matador. In person she is soft-spo-
ken and charming but her steely determi-
nation shows through whenever she talks
of her profession.

“I have lived along the border and in-

San Diego all my life. I started to go to
bullfights when I was young, but didn’t
start trying to be a bullfighter until I was
sort of old, about 19. Watching the fights I
became an aficionada and after a while I
just had to try for myself. “So I tried
fighting a baby calf just to see what it felt
like and from that I went to grown bulls.
“I never thought I would be a profes-

sional bullfighter but one thing led to an-
other and that is all I want to be. It wasn’t
until 1978 that I‘went to Mexico City to try
to become a novillera (semi-pro). I just
wanted to try to go as far as other women
have gone. There have been lots of ama-
teur women bullfighters but I never
dreamed I would pass them all to become
a full-fledged matador. I received alterna-
tiva in September, 1981, at Tijuana which
is one of the two major bullrings of Mexi-
co, so I did it in an important ring which is
also important. Since my professional sta-
tus I have fought 70 professional fights.”

obstacles

Part of the attraction of bullfighting is
facing and conquering the fear of personal
danger, and Martinez must face that as
straightforwardly as any male matador.

“I have been tossed and had six frac-
tures but haven’t had a goring,” she said.
“I sort of want one, because to a matador
it is like a medal of honor in time of war. I
want to know if I have the bravery to come
back to fight bulls afterwards. I want to
know what it feels like. Part of what I do is
face the possibility of a goring and I’m
sort of jealous that I haven’t had one.”

She feels she has achieved her high sta-
tus because “I was the one who was per-
sistent while others couldn’t stick with the
road, the very straight and narrow road
you must follow to become a professional.
And at times it was three steps forward
and two back, but every time I would be
knocked back I would keep going. There is

just something in me that wouldn’t let me"
give up. I was brought up in the United
States with a different frame of mind than
women in Mexico and I knew I could do it
if I just kept at it.” _,

O’Bolger believes the fact that no harm

will come to the bulls and that there will

_ be a knowledgable narrator to explain the
‘action in the Astrodome will bring out
many people who are curious about bull-
tfighting but would not watch a fight in
iwhich the bull is killed. Yet he speaks
i poetically about the atavistic appeal of his
i chosen profession, which he terms an art
form rather than a sport.
‘2 “You have to understand the animal.
3 He is an extremely violent animal and not
domesticable like a dog. He has an inbred
instinct for violence. We as men are only
10,000 years into agriculture, away from
hunting and gathering. It is a very primi-
tive instinct in man to be going back to
this hunter gathering time. But bullfight-
ing is not just hunting an animal. It is
Staking this violent force of nature and
:, turning it into something with esthetic and
i artistic value.
, “Anybody can learn the technique of
' passing the animal by him with a cape,
but we control the animal to create some-
" thing artistic. There is this suspended mo-
; tion, this plastic beauty, that is kind of like
‘ ballet. It lasts for seconds and then is
gone. You try. to link all these elements
together to create a truly artistic perfor-

mance.”

Mono Lake

rom a distance that oval of dark

blue at the base of the Eastern
Sierra looks much. like what Mark
Twain dubbed it—“the Dead Sea of
California.” So why would anyone put
a “Save Mono Lake” sticker on a car?
You have only to detour to the water’s
edge to discover that Mono Lake is
not dead but decidedly alive and vital.
A good place to get acquainted is at
the new reserve on the south shore
that protects the odd minarets made
from mineral deposits called tufa.

The road to the reserve is noiseless,
just tires rolling over a cushion of this
soft stuff, an eerie prelude. The tufa
towers seem bizarre at first. But wan-
der among them and the bizarre be-
comes the beautiful as you grow
aware of the quiet and the big sky
overhead. Only at the very edge of the
water is this calm interrupted.

There the tufa is crowded with
ﬂies, swarms so thick that they cover
the rocks with a blanket of black.
Uninterested in you or your picnic
lunch, these are brine ﬂies that live
and breed in the salty water of Mono

Lake. They were considered a delica-
cy by early residents, who took their
tribal name from the creatures—
Mono apparently meaning ﬂy people.

Today, birds harvest the ﬂies and
the equally tiny brine shrimp that in-
habit the lake, unusually plentiful be-
cause there are no fish. In contrast, a
bird could starve at Lake Tahoe be-
cause the fish leave so little.

Where you stand watching this ac-
tivity was once lake bottom. The orig-
inal shoreline was about a mile away
and 50 feet higher before the snow-
melt was diverted to Los Angeles to
water lawns and wash cars. This is the
source of the controversy. As the level
dropped, it exposed a land bridge
that coyotes and others use to cross to
an island where the California gull
raises its young. Also, without fresh
water this salt lake may become too
salty for even the ﬂies or shrimp. With
them will go the birds and other signs
of life and then Mono Lake will truly
be a dead sea, as deserted as the am-
ber-colored ghost town of Bodie, just
a few miles away. —R0bert Smaus

g ‘ HE wild horse

‘1 presents a

sticky prob-

lem,” writes

”. ichard Symanski in Wild

.iiiforses .and Sacred Cows.

About 70,000 wild horses roam
the public lands of the West.

Few animals are as popular
as; horses. “We love them,” Sy-
manski says, “we kiss them,
we talk to them, we dream
about them, we give them human names, we ’see ourselves
or others in their personalities.”

At the same time, wild horses magnify our enchantment
with the West, representing “independence, freedom, a lost
and idyllic frontier, an open-spaced refuge from the urban
mxasma.”

Symanski explores every facet of one of the more emo-
tional public lands issues: How can the wild herds overpop-

ulating and overgrazing the rangelands be managed?
Seeking answers, he conducted 200 interviews and trav-
eled 15,000 miles. He found four concerned (if not conten-
tious) factions: ardent horse-lovers; cattle-loving ranchers;
crusty, horse-hunting buckaroos; and “know-it-all” range
managers of the’ federal Bureau of Land Management.
One of the “sacred cows” Symanski examines relates to
our diet: Americans do not eat horse meat. The Japanese

do. And so do the French and
other Europeans. But even
eating horses might not solve
this complex problem. Part of
the issue is the cattle indus-
try’s domination of public land
use.

The Bureau of Land Man-
agement, Symanski says, “has
not done a commendable job”
regarding its mandate to prop-
erly care for public lands. Cat-
tle predominate; wild horses
proliferate; the range suffers.

What the author reveals is
that objectivity on the wild-
horse issue is hard to find. Re-
gardless of their beauty and
image, too many wild horses
can ruin the range.

Symanski urges that solu—
‘ tions be found soon, for “with
each passing hour in which too many mouths feed on fragile
grasses and drink scarce water, the chances of reversing
man’s stupidity decreases.”

Here ’5 an‘Animal Story T hat’s a Bit Hard to

—A Labrador retriever walked around for
more than a month with a 10-inch, l4-ounce
socket wrench in its belly, a veterinarian in
Middleboro, Mass., said. “This is probably the
strangest thing I’ve ever seen," David H. R.
Johnson said. An uncharacteristic loss of
appetite was the first sign something was
wrong with Lattie, a 56-pound, 8-year-old
purebred, Johnson said. “That’s unusual be-
cause she’s such a good old chow hound,” he
said. “She came in and was her happy, jovial
self. But I was feeling her belly, and I said,
‘What in the heck is this?’ I decided we had
better take an X-ray. When I did, I almost fell
over.” Lattie’s owner, Sandra Kesse of Ware-
ham, said she had no idea how the wrench got
inside her pet. “We don’t even have tools
around the house,” she said. Johnson said he
could not determine if the wrench was
ingested or whether it was forcibly put into
the dog. “She’d have to take it down like a
sword swallower would," Johnson said. The
veterinarian removed the wrench during
more than three hours of surgery. He said he
believes the wrench had been inside the dog
for at least a month because a hole it poked in
Lattie’s stomach had healed.

10 horses combined—more than
most humans, for that matter.

For one thing, she has the gift of
language, albeit a horse version, rang-
ing from a soft, affectionate nicker to
grunts of pleasure when she’s rolling
in the sand after a sweaty workout.
I’ve heard her scream in anxiety,
whinny in joy, snort in disgust. But
she’s at her best when demanding her
due respect in the form of carrots.
There’s no mistaking that one.

characteristics is the white sclera
around their eyes, like that of a hu-
man. And like a human, Uppity can
get that certain look in her eyes that
communicates as well as any words,
i which is pretty unnerving when

you’re on the receiving end. She can
wrinkle her nostrils in disdain and
grind her teeth when annoyed. She
makes her point quite effectively by
swiveling her ears around and swish-
ing her tail.

She will only be caught when she
deigns to be caught. She’ll let you get

i close, almost there, then whirl away
and—when there’s no danger of con-
meeting—she’ll kick one or both
heels in your direction. You can

' gauge the degree of her emphasis by
whether it’s a one- or two—heeler.

In Appaloosa lingo, she’s consid-
ered to be a classic model, what a ’57
T-Bird is to a car buff. She looks as

M any years ago, when
the West was wild in a

way different from today,

horses were prized beyond
value by the Indians, be-
cause the animals provided
transportation and the
means to chase game, ﬂee
from danger or barter for a
bride. A particularly brave
and beautiful breed of
spotted horse, known today
as the Appaloosa, was first
bred and treasured by the
Northwest Nez Perce
tribes. Many of their rituals
and ceremonies centered
on these horses, whose
speed, stamina and spirit
often meant the difference
between life and death for
their owners.

In one ancient legend,
the medicine man of the
tribe would bless the preg-

paint, then touch the right
hip of the mare with his
fingers, leaving distinct
prints. The legend goes
that a horse thus marked
would be possessed of a
certain magic.

When I first saw Gar—
ryowen Uproar in a dusty
pasture in Oklahoma, I
knew she was special, and
that was long before I stum-
bled upon the legend. She
was only 2 years old, not
overly trained or handled
and already several months
in foal. She was friendly,
though, and had a natural
curiosity about humans.
She let me touch her, then
stretched her neck into the
air, raising her upper lip

however. She chose me; it’s

as simple as that.
Fortunately for me, the
owners hadn’t read the leg-
end either and parted with
her readily enough, telling
me only that her nickname
was Uppity. Little did I
know she was to live up to
that in spades. It seemed
that she, at least, was fully
cognizant of her destiny as
a magic horse, with the
name to match. From that
first day, her role in life was
to educate me to that fact.

“ later, I heard her groan. I ran to the

barn. She was lying outside in the

grass, beginning her labor.

She raised her head, nodded in ap-
proval, gave a big sigh and got down

to business. Soon, a beautiful filly
stood on wobbly legs, right before my

eyes. The miracle of birth has a magic
all its own. I realized that she had
waited for me to come home, then
called to let me know it was time. She
has magic, all right. Humans call it

Uppity does her ancestors proud,
fulfilling the prophecy admirably, but
I’ve added a bit to that legend. Once
you find a magic horse with the hand-
print on her hip, you get to keep her,

When dolphins give birth in the wild, one of the fe-
males acts as a midwife, regularly pushing the new-
born dolphin to the surface to breathe until the “7:.
mother has recuperated enough to take over. ' 1

“That strong maternal instinct makes them very
possesswe with a pregnant woman out there,” '. .~ .
Lloyd Borguss said. '

' . The Borguss family once played a trick on the an-
imals, bringing in a woman who was pregnant with-
wms. ,- - ‘ -- ‘ -,

“The dolphins couldn’t figure it out. They kept 1‘
rubbing their snouts on her belly. One extra heart- ‘1
beat they could accept, but they couldn’t accou'fit"
for three. They don’t have multiple births,” Lloyzf -'
Borguss said. " ‘ ... i
A swimmer with a pacemaker elicited similar-’7'
puzzlement.

Giving humans rides is not instinctive dolphin be-
havior, but most that are around humans acquire
the habit, Brigetta Borguss said.

“They just pick it up. Once you gain their trust,
it’s a natural thing for you to touch them and hold
onto them. If you hold their fins and they taltz off,
you get a ride. Once they realize that makes-s “xvii-u
happy, then they do it all the time,” Brigeti: Efior-
guss said. ,

It is not unusual for the dolphins to blatantly pre-i
fer a particular swimmer, or to shun another, espe-
cially if the swimmer has an aggressive personality.
In order to insure that everyone gets a ride, the dol-~;
phins are rewarded with sardines when they tow
swimmers to the dock.

Those who find favor with the animals will get
rides even after the sardines are gone. That leaves .
the humans trying to curry favor with the dolphins. '
Uneasiness with the role reversal of master and pet :
is a common reaction among the swimmers, accord.
,ing .to Smith’s research. ;'

The dolphins chirp and make choking sounds,
sometimes diving to the bottom of the water in
groups to converse in a code no human has been
able to break. That leaves the swimmers feeling a
little left out, wondering if the dolphins are talking

'rﬂdlll-O.-J"'i,

ost swimmers also are surprised at how
gentle the dolphins are, how soft and
smooth their skin is -- wet suede is the
most common comparison .— and how warm they
are.

“They’re not slimy or icky like a fish,” Lloyd Bor

guss said. “Most people know that they are mam- Z ’?
mals, but they don’t expect their body temperatures

to be the same as their own.”

The animals do not bite, but occasionally nuzzle
swimmers’ legs with their small teeth, a sign of dol-E
phin affection. :

After swimming with the dolphins, people have

THE HOUSTON POST - Feb. 9, 1986
E they_pl_ay nioegoeople can swnm WlUI me mammals

in on other foot when humans
become dolphins’ pet

 

EY LARGO, Fla. (UPI) — Four times a day,
the Borguss family allows groups of hu-
-"-_~ mans into their saltwater canal to swim
’ ’th their pet dolphins. It is for the amusement of
’ dolphins, not the humans.
it'fBut the humans are apt to get the ride of their
lives.

For $25 they can swim and frolick with four of the
family’s eight dolphins for 30 minutes. Mask and fin
rental is extra.

The family is fond of telling swimmers that they
are fresh toys, brought in daily to amuse the ani-
mals.

“Here, you are the toy, the puppy trying to please
the dolphin. In the water, they are the masters and
you are the pets,” said Lloyd Borguss.

If the dolphins are in a good mood, and they al-
most always are, they will tip their dorsal fins to-
ward the swimmers, wait for them to grab hold, and
take off — racing across the canal with the swim-
mers in tow alongside.

Often, two dolphins will approach, allow the
swimmer to grip onto both, and race away in uni-
son, occasionally diving below the surface. The gig-
gling swimmers, aloft between the two animals,
must let go or gulp for air and hold their breath until
the animals surface.

“It’s a blast. You just have to experience it,” said
Tyler Britt, a children’s librarian from Roan Moun-
tain, Tenn, vacationing in Key Largo with her hus-
band and daughter. “I can tell a story the kids
would not believe.”

he dolphins live in a fenced-off portion of a 12-
foot deep canal that ﬂows between the At-
lantic Ocean and Rock Harbor. The tide’s

cleansing action flushes away bacteria that could
cause problems in an enclosed tank and helps keep
the animals from catching colds from their human
“pets.”
If the dolphins are in a bad mood, or tire of their
j human company, they can swim into a fenced area
warhere humans are forbidden. They rarely seek ref-
;su'ge there, and never for very long.
L; ,'The Borguss’ dolphins are Atlantic bottlenose dol-
ayhins, the Flipper type. Teen-agers by dolphin stan-
ggdards, they are 8 feet long and weigh 350 pounds.
We males will grow to weigh up to 500 pounds. De-
“; ite their enormity they are extraordinarily playful
ﬁnd their large, curved mouths give them a perpetu-
ggiwimpish smile.

sg‘raimng Center.
1:.‘1-Brigetta had wanted to own dolphins since she
fmas a teen-ager cleaning pools and cutting fish for a
' marine show in her native Switzerland.

,“But in Europe you can’t just go out and catch a
dolphin,” she said.

After moving to Florida, she and her husband ob-
tained the neCessary state and federal permits, and
trapped the dolphins at Charlotte Harbor near Fort
Myers on Florida’s Gulf Coast. A veterinarian visits

the young pups; and they were effective
enough. Between 1915 and 1942, profes-
sional hunters were paid by the federal
government for killing 24,132 wolves,
mostly in the northern Rockies. At least
136 of those wolves were killed in Yel-
lowstone.

Another monthly report of the su-
perintendent, for late 1927, contained the
entry: ”It is doubtful if there are more
than a very few wolves in the entire park
area.” This should be seen, in context, as a
boast of successfully executed policy.

Since the thirties, true to that boast,
no viable wolf packs have been detected
in Yellowstone Park. During the past 50
years there have been only sporadic and
often uncertain sightings, mostly of lone
animals or pairs. In 19 75 a biologist named
John Weaver began searching systemati-
cally for wolves; he spent many hours in a
light plane above the park, set out baits
and cameras, played recorded wolf howls,
snowshoed and skied all through the
backcountry. After a year of work, he had
found only two sets of tracks and heard
one series of answering howls. He never
glimpsed a wolf.

But times change and so do laws. As
of 19 73, the northern Rocky Mountain wolf
has been officially judged ”endangered.”
Therefore a recovery plan was mandated.
Having labored so hard to be rid of the
wolf, our federal government (as now rep—
resented by the Fish and Wildlife Service)

 

declared that we should somehow, per-
haps, get the animal back.

Certain folks disagree. Most cattle-
men and sheep ranchers out here in Mon-
tana and Idaho and Wyoming seem to
feel that the feds had it right the first time.
These folk would rather see tax money
spent on killing wolves than on transplant-
ing and nurturing them. Sure enough,
wolves do sometimes wander out of the
wilderness to kill domestic stock, and the
stock growers don’t understand why they
should tolerate that risk—not even under
a system of cash compensation for wolf-
killed stock, and with provisions for kill-
ing or moving any wolves that stray onto
ranching land. But some ranchers are at
least discussing the Wolf Recovery Plan
(an intricate document with a handful of

 

 

Mech’s statement sounds straightfor-
ward, and without doubt it is true. But the
wolf's protean image, as impressed over
centuries upon the human consciousness,
is anything but straightforward. It is more
like a looming fireﬁght shadow. The real
animal itself is complicated enough; the
conceptual wolf is even more so. Barry
Lopez, in his wonderful book Of “blues
and Men (an invaluable essay, by the way,
for anyone who cares to think deeply about
wild animals), has aptly written: ”Folklore
made of the wolf a creature possessed.
There was a great mystery about the wolf
and a fabulous theater of images devel-
oped around him. He was the Devil, red
tongued, sulfur breathed, and yellow eyed;
he was the werewolf, human cannibal; he
was the lust, greed, and violence that men
saw in themselves.”

Compare that theater of images with
the one perceived by Joe Helle, a sheep
rancher from Dillon, Montana, who served
for a time on the Wolf Recovery Team.
”We’re getting this comparison of the wolf
looking like a little Bambi,” Helle has said.

j ”These pseudo-environmentalists think

the wolf just sniffs the air and looks
cute, that he doesn’t tear the belly out of
a living horse or sheep, that he doesn’t

hamstring sheep and drag them down—

 

 

 

important but negotiable facts). Other
stockmen are just going red in the face. A
few environmentalists will likely go red in
the face over this thing, too.

Still, if compromise and patience and
sound ecological reasoning prevail, we may
have viable wolf packs back in Yellow-
stone, feeding on the park’s overabundance
of elk and bison. But that won’t come about
easily, and it may not come soon. Tit: is-
sue, like the wolf, is a multifarious beast.

Everyone looks, and everyone sees
something different.

”THE WOLF IS A STRONG, SENSITIVE, INTELLI-
gent animal with complex social behavior

 

 

and lasting family ties,” according to Da-
vid Mech, a biologist who has been this
country's leading scientific authority on
wolves for most of the last 20 years.

and choke the living breath from their
throats.”

Another spokesman for the stock in-
dustry is Stan Boyd, an executive of the
Idaho Wool Growers Association. He is
somewhat more temperate than Joe Helle.
Speaking by phone from Boise, Boyd ex-
plained his particular objections to the
Recovery Plan. Then he told me: ”We're
not scared of the wolf. The real wolf in
this case is the federal agency.”

If you think back upon those official
extermination campaigns of 60 and 70
years ago, it is easy to share Stan Boyd’s
wariness of the federal incubus. But the
identity of the real wolf, in this case or
any other, is a trickier question. Maybe all
the abstractions and field studies and
mythical images can never do justice to
this complex, individualistic species, and
the real wolf is purely and only the real
wolf—which is precisely the one that, in
the case of Yellowstone, we have not got.

To the Nunamiut Eskimo people of
northern Alaska, who live as closely jux-
taposed with wolves as any harried
rancher, the animal is a revered toternic
character called Amaguk. Concerning
this creature, Amaguk the wolf, Barry
Lopez has paraphrased an old Nunamiut
man: ”Amaguk is like Nunamiut. He
doesn’t hunt when the weather is bad. He
likes to play. He works hard to get food for
his family. His hair starts to get white when

he is old.... And Amaguk is tough, liv-

  

ing at 50 below zero, through blizzards, for
months without caribou. Like Nunamiut.
Maybe tougher. And Amaguk is smart.”
Amaguk in other words is as sensible
and complicated—and no more devilish

' than—man.

Lopez also says: ”For the Nunamiut
there is no ’ultimate wolf reality.’ The ani—
mal is observed as a part of the universe.
Some things are known, other things are
hidden. Some of the wolf is known, some
is not.”

The elk population of Yellowstone
Park is roughly 20,000. Knowledgeable
observers argue that this is far too many,
and that those huge herds of hungry elk,
in the absence of control by predators, are
over-grazing and over-browsing the
range, doing serious damage to their own
habitat. The same may be true of the
Yellowstone bison, which now number ap-
proximately two thousand and, like the
elk, have almost no surviving natural ene-
mies to keep the herds culled and healthy.
Every year hundreds of elk starve to death
in Yellowstone; hundreds more migrate
across the park’s northern boundary, to
be shot by Montana hunters in a special
elk season that resembles Pickett’s charge
at Gettysburg. Lately the bison have also
begun spilling over that northern bound-
ary, and now they, too, are being killed
with big—game rifles. (To say they are being
”hunted” would be to stretch the meaning
of that word). The head of the first bison

 

 

 

 

 

to die this past winter will adorn the wall
of a rec room in Havre, Montana. Fine, I
suppose that’s marginally better than let-
ting the animals starve—but what is miss- .
ing from this entire picture? Do we need a
program of supplemental winter feeding— ,
hay bales thrown off a truck—for the over-
abundant Yellowstone herbivores? Do we
need a Yellowstone National Fence? No,
obviously what we need is a predator.

It is a stated purpose of the National
Park Service to ”conserve, perpetuate, and
portray as a composite whole” the indige-
nous fauna of each park ecosystem. But in
Yellowstone there is no composite whole
—as long as there is no wolf.

Possibly a good and wise Wolf Re-
covery Plan can correct that. Any such
plan will need to protect the legitimate
interests of ranchers, though without being
hostage to their every demand. It will also
need to mandate the active transplanting
of wolves from Canadian or Minnesotan
populations—because Canis lupus irre-
motus has no plausible chance of recolo—
nizing Yellowstone on its own. To gain
acceptance, the plan may even need to
allow stock growers the freedom to shoot
any wolf that strays out onto ranching land.

We can make these necessary, pains-
taking efforts and bring the Yellowstone
wolf back to its vacant ecological niche.
Or we can settle for a conceptual wolf in
the niche it occupies now: haunting only
our imaginations and memories. 15

'Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery
Plan.” This document is merely a draft,
intended to attract public comment be-
fore a more final plan can be promul-
gated, let alone acted upon. Whether any
such plan will ever be acted upon still
remains in some doubt. Federal law (the
Endangered Species Act) dictates that,
since the wolf in the northern Rockies is
officially ”endangered,” some effort in this
direction must be made; but federal law
cannot guarantee that the effort will suc-
ceed. The draft is a product of research
and committee work by a diverse group of
individuals, known collectively as the
Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery
Team, who have been deliberating inter-
mittently (with some turnover in mem-
bership) for the past decade. The purpose
of the N RMWR Team, and of their plan, is
to advance the possibility of reestablish-
ing viable wolf pOpulations within certain

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

select areas of the northern Rockies. One
of the three chosen areas—and in some
ways the most logical—is the greater Yel-
lowstone ecosystem.

THE WOLF THAT ONCE ROAMED IN PACKS ON
the Yellowstone plateau was a subspecies
of Canis lupus classified as Canis lupus
irremotus. It ranged all along the Rockies
from southern Idaho and Wyoming through
western Montana, and up into Alberta and
British Columbia. It lived off the herds of
large ungulates sharing its territory, the
elk and the deer and the bison, supple-
menting that diet when necessary with
beaver or other small mammals. As the
wild ungulates began disappearing, the
wolf turned, occasionally, to what was re-
placing them on the range: cattle and
sheep. Consequently, Canis lupus irremotus,
like all other subspecies of wolf in the
continental United States, made human

 

mountain sheep, and antelope were con-
sidered to be what Yellowstone was all
about. Today we prefer to think of Yellow-
stone Park as a haven for wildlife, all
native wildlife. But back in those early
days, remember, the operative word was
'game.’ Wolves were not game. They were
‘vermin.’ Even the more accurate word
‘predator,’ when used at all, was applied
as a damning epithet.

A few sensible sportsmen evidently
did raise their voices in protest, though,
and so the superintendent of Yellowstone
was compelled to write, in one of his
monthly reports for 1922: 'It is evident
that the work of controlling these animals
[wolves] must be vigorously prosecuted by
the most effective means available whether
or not this meets with the approval of cer-
tain game conservationists.” The means

. available included trapping, strychnine

poisoning, shooting, raiding dens to kill

former ranger at Gulf

Aslands National Sea-

shore off the Mississippi
coast was on campground
patrol near a boat ramp when
he saw a woman toss a rubber
ball into the bayou for her
poodle to chase.

”She was throwing it
into an area used as a fish-
cleaning station,” the ranger
recalls. ”Fish slop going into
the water fed the ’gators that
hung around there. I ex-
plained this, saying I was sorry
but her dog was not allowed
off the leash. I said I would be
back, but would give her
time to comply with regulations
before ticketing her.”

As he walked away he
heard the woman scream.
Before she’d even been able to
comply with his request, the
dog had been pulled under-
water by an alligator.

Such stories tend to
become legends in the N a-
tional Park Service, but taken
with trailhead signs show-
ing a dog crossed out by a red
slash, the message is clear:

The family pet and national
parks do not mix.

The sign posted at the Hoh
River trailhead of Olympic
National Park in Washington
eloquently explains why pets
have been banned from the
backcountry and must be
kept under physical restraint
elsewhere in nearly all na-
tional parks. Titled ”Your pet—
friend or foe,” the sign reads:
”The undisturbed wilderness
before you is the home of
elk, deer, and bear, animals
which by instinct have been
known to attack pets and some-
times their owners. Dogs
and cats have harassed and
killed smaller wildlife. Their
mere presence scares animals,
making wildlife viewing dif-
ficult. By taking your pet into
the backcountry you not
only violate federal regulations,
but threaten the safety and
enjoyment of your own wilder-
ness experience and that of
fellow hikers as well. Protect
wildlife, protect your pet,
protect yourself.”

and Glacier parks, is among

the most restrictive, according
to rangers.

”Rangers are authorized to
shoot dogs that are running
loose,” says James Dempsey,

for
the NPS Rocky Mountain
Regional Office in Denver.
”You hate like hell to do it, and
try your best to capture them

 

and turn them over to the
Humane Society, but they
sometimes ruin wildlife and
have to be shot.”

House cats are also cul-
prits. Carrie Armstrong of
Houston remembers when two
of her family’s cats were
allowed to roam during a
childhood camping trip in
Rocky Mountain National
Park. She awoke to find the
campsite littered with hun-
dreds of dead field mice. ”They
were everywhere,” she recalls.
”On the picnic table, on top
of the car. The familynext to
us talked about Wildcats leap-
ing onto their tent that night.
We didn’t have the heart to
tell them they belonged to us.”

Canyonlands National
Park in Utah has tradition-
ally had a liberal policy toward
pets in the backcountry, but
in recent years its approach has
hardened. Ken Mabery, co-
ordinator of ranger activities for
the NPS Southwest Regional
Office in Santa Fe, says: ”While
I worked there in the seven-
ties, the park went from an
open policy where we almost
overlooked leash laws, to en-
forcing the leash laws, to clos-
ing the backcountry to pets.”

The park finally closed its
trails to pets in 19 75 for sev-
eral reasons: to protect the pop-
ulation of desert bighom
sheep, to guard against harass-
ment of hikers on difficult
trails, and to prevent the con-
tamination of springs used for
drinking water. The park
recently restricted the presence
of pets on roads that provide
access by four-wheel drive to
the backcountry. Pets are al-
lowed there, but only if they
stay within sight of their own-
ers’ vehicle.

Pet owners shouldn’t de-
spair, however. People who
want to hike and camp with
their pets are generally wel-
come in wilderness lands man-
aged by the Bureau of Land
Management and the Forest
Service. And one national
park, Chaco Culture National
Historical Park in New Mex-
ico, still allows dogs and cats in
the backcountry—as long as
they’re on a leash.

THE TAMPA TRIBUNE, Tuesday, February 25, 1986

 

 

Researchers wonder
why opossums thrive

GAINESVILLE (AP) -— Rat-like
opossums are ugly, stupid, primitive
and they don’t live long -— and the
species is thriving.

Not only have they survived vir-
tually unchanged over the eons, but
they also are expanding their habi-
tat, says a University of Florida re-
searcher who wonders why.

“Granted, they have a brain like
a BB in a box car. They’ll go into un-
baited traps. They seem to have a
habit of seeking out the tires of mov-
ing cars,” said Mel Sunquist of UF’s
Florida State Museum, “But they’re
not going extinct —— not even close.

“Fossil records indicate the opos-
sum has been in NorthrAmerica for
about 2 million years and, in that
time, it has changed very little from
its primitive ancestors,” said Sun-
quist, who is heading a study in the
marsupials.

He and other scientists have
caught and tagged 360 opossums
during the past three years at the
university’s open-air laboratory, the
9,200-acre Katharine Ordway Pre-
serve near Melrose.

They also are studying the South
American opossum in Venezuela,
which is a close relative of the North
American or Virginia opossum.

Despite all their shortcomings,
opossums aren’t dying out. Instead,
said Sunquist, they have steadily ex-
panded their northward range.

In part, this is because the fe-
males carry their nests on them ——

pouches with 13 nipples where new-
borns, about the size of a grubworm,
further develop for nine to 10 weeks,
he said.

“They may not have huge brains.
They may not have a vocal reper-
tory much larger than a hiss. They
have primative body language and
facial gestures. And socially, they’re
not very highly evolved,” Sunquist
said.

“But they are survivors, and they
adapt well and that’s more than
you can say for some of nature’s
most magnificent creations like the
panther and the whooping crane,”
he said.

In the UP study, small radio
transmitters are attached to some of
the adult females to see .how they se-
lect their dens and to monitor their
movements.

Sunquist also is interested in
their reproductive strategies.

“Females have two litters a year,
and the average litter size is about
seven,” he said. “We’ve found that
only about one out of the seven will
survive long enough to reproduce.

“And most females don’t survive
to mate in their second year,” the re-
searcher said.

However, the odd creatures
make good pets, he added, if you can
stand their looks. With black, beady
eyes, fur as soft as hay, long, pointy
faces and mouths full of teeth, the
creatures aren’t exactly cuddly look-
ing.

on Rockdale animal shelter

The Georgia Supreme Court on
Thursday affirmed a lower court or-

animal rshelter in Rockdale County.

If *the fine is retroactive to the

Clarence Vaughn, the total would
come to‘rbughiy $70,000 through the
end of February. The money is
owed to the homeowners who filed
suit against the animal shelter,
charging that it was a nuisance and
violated county ordinances.

To The Commercial Appeal:

In reference to your Feb. 19 story

is my firm belief that vicious dogs are
vicious because their owners are negli-

Rather than “destroy” the semi-er-
rant dogs, I propose that we send these
dogs’ owners to the Memphis Animal
Shelter for 10 days for observation, and
if necessary, destruction. I dare say this
action would (l) place the blame where
it belongs, and (2) greatly reduce the

Beagle digs termites

By MARILYN BROWN
Staff Writer

ANNY, THE lB-POUND beagle acquired

by Dallas Pest and Termite Services Inc., is

quiet and unassuming. But his demeanor is
' misleading. .

Danny has a «mission in life. He hunts termites.

Danny progresses from a sleepy dog to a canine
computer when his handler sets him loose on the
hunt, says trainer Robert Outman of Belmont,
Calif, a specialist in animal behavior and the
founder of TADD Services Corp, a company that
leases beagles to pest-control companies
nationwide. .

Why bother with beagles for ferreting out terv
mites? Danny, his trainer says, has a big advantage
over his human competition: Danny can work in
areas inaccessible to people.

Outman’s current hit squad consists of 30 highly
trained male beagles whose acute senses of smell
and hearing help them detect termites.

“I don’t mean to be sexist about this thing,” Out-
man says. “But, on the tests that were given to the
small breeds of dogs, the male beagles’ superior
smelling and hearing senses enabled them to score
higher [than females].”

Danny, the first TADD dog to be stationed in
Dallas, arrived a few weeks ago.

Outman says seven people originally were con- _ ,3. ' a , _, y
sidered as handlers for Danny. Glen Bjornaas of W , ~ ' 75w .‘
Dallas Pest and Termite Service was chosen. 0 i MTNSWWT I“ . - ~

“When Danny is in a working mode, he will do "

CHARLOTTE, N .C. — Her favorite food is ,
Godiva chocolate, but she loves lobster, too. And
champagne, although it makes her tipsy. She has red
hair, wears Oscar de la 'Renta perfume and takes
nude walks on the beach. A special brass fanfare
was composed for her coming-out party Saturday.

Pampered, you say? Spoiled? You bet.

“She’s really just a gorgeous animal,” said Dr.
' ‘ ymond Sattler, a Lumberton, NC, neurosurgeon.
He should know. She’s his pig: Norma Jean —- 600
- pounds of cosseted Duroc. ‘
More than 200 people gathered at the Ramada
Inn in Lumberton Saturday night to honor her at a
black-tie event complete with string quartet and big-
band dance music.
Norma Jean wore a pink tutu, white feather boa
and rhinestone earrings -—— “really gorgeous with her

 

red hair,” said Sattler. ‘

The party date was appropriate. March 1 is
widely recognized as NationallPig Day. ,

Jack Tate traveled all the way from his home in
Greenville, SC, to take part in the event. Tate is
curator of the Short Snoui; Society, an organization
with more than 500 members in 23 states and six
foreign countries dedicated to praising the pig.

“Every day is pig day to us,” he said.

Said society President Bob "Howard, a Columbia,
S.C.,,banker: “The fact that the rest of the nation
joins us for one day is fairly inmnsequential. We’re
pigging out 365 days a year. We’re just high on the
hog in every way.”

The society stages two big blasts a year in
Greenville to honor the pig ~— the May Gala, a
barbecue; and the October Swine Ball in the Fall.

He Used to Herd Sheep, Now He Does Lunch

By PATT MORRISON,
Times Staff Writer

After a day like Wednesday, he'll
probably start calling himself Mi-
chael.

Mike the Dog stamped his bor-
der-collie paws into wet cement,
and brought out more cameras than
George Burns got for his latest star
(he Ms three) on the Hollywood
sidewalk.

But of course, ‘Mike has more

hair.
‘ The runaway dog star of the
current film “Down"'and Out in
Beverly Hills,” about what hap-
pens when Skid Row meets Rodeo
Drive, showed up Wednesday at
the Tail 0’ the Pup hot dog restau-
rant, a bit of classically tacky local
architecture, to make his mark in a
more durable medium: concrete.

Restaurant owner Eddie Blake,

more unnerved by the horde of.

photographers than the dog was,

said Mike was “the first dog to be

immoralized in cement.”

From his humble beginnings
herding sheep, Mike has gone Hol-
lyWood—-or rather, Hollywood
came to Mike, the dog who has his
own stunt double.

All the Beautiful Canines were

namesake‘put paw prints in Mann’s
Chinese Theater cement back
when it was Grauman’s, and who is
the only animal with a star on the

Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Then, from an air-conditioned
Cadillac limo—whose driver ad-
mitted that Mike was less trouble

than some two-legged celebri-
ties—Mike sprang out to meet his
public, including Gloria Nordstrom,
who had driven from Glendale so
her dog could see him.

“Mike is his idol,” laughed
N ordstrom, as her Australian shep-
herd, Digger, nosed at hot dog
remnants.

After one misstep, Mike pressed
his front paws squarely into the
gray goop. As his owner-trainer,
Clint Rowe, scratched. a message
into the square, Mike sniffed the
tail of a Yorkshire terrier, then
went through his Stanislavsky
paces for cameramen, waving,
leaping, barking, and giving a Hol-
lywood air-kiss to his host, Blake.

Then he was back in the limo to
shop Rodeo Drive for a TV enter-
tainment-magazine show.

“I’ve never seen a Gucci,” said
the cowboy-booted Rowe, ruefully.
“Someone had to tell me what it is.”

Mike wasn’t the only top dog
there Wednesday.

“There’s no bigger fan of Benji
than me, seriously, in the whole
world," gushed a woman in a
Flintstones T-shirt. “Can I shake
his hand?"

And from his stroller, 2-year-old
Christopher Jermaeus, unswayed
by apretty new muzzle, knew a
star when he saw one: “Lassie!” he
chortled. “Lassie!”

 

 

 




Indeed, Groveman contended, so
dubious has documentation become
that African countries whose ele-
phant populations are known to
have been wiped out long ago, are
still—on paper—exporting ele-
phant tusks. Permits sometimes

turn up from nations whose ivory

quotas have already been met, or

where elephant hunting is prohib-
ited, he said.

It is a paper-trail process City
Atty. Hahn likened to the laun-
dering of money. Some countries
“virtually wiped out their elephant
population, yet they’re still export-
ingivory.”

In some countries, “permits can
be bought,” Riley said.

The paper problems are one
reason California took the legisla-
tive step of barring elephant ivory
entirely, and the renewed trade is
frustrating for Rep. Anthony C.
Beilenson (D-Los Angeles), who
authored California’s original en-
dangered-species law when he was
a state senator and who took the-
ivory issue with him to Washing-
ton.

His first no-ivory bill passed the
House in 1979, but was rejected by
'the Senate. His next two tries were
bogged down in a House commit-
tee. “We sort of got discouraged
after two Congresses,” said aide
Melissa Kuckrow. “Part of it is the
deregulation mentality that has
taken hold."

. The lure of ivory is an ancient
one; ivory objects were found in
King Tutankhamen’s tomb.

“There’s no doubt ivory is a very

beautiful commodity,” Riley said.

“Some of the most beautiful jewel-
ry I’ve ever seen has been ivory.
But then again, you don’t see the
slaughter or killing that goes on to
obtain this merchandise. I feel if
most individuals saw what goes on
to get this, they wouldn’t buy the
ivory.”

Environmental groups, tradi-
tional guardians of animal species
at risk, fear for the elephant, but
they are confronted by mounting
concerns—from cond-ors and labo-
ratory animals to the northern
white rhino, which numbers only
3,900, said Emily Mead of the
World Wildlife Fund.

Because of that, African ele-
phants are “not a high priority in
terms of lobbying,” with more
critical species such as the rhino at
stake, she said. Still, “We encour-
age people to decrease the use of
.threatened- and endangered-spe-
cies products.” Elephant items are
available now, “but who’s to say
what’s to happen in the next 20
years? If everyone starts buying it,
it’ll disappear.”

When Groveman appeared on a
television show about 18 months
ago to discuss the law, some out-

,4’

raged consumers tore up credit
cards of stores selling ivory, and at
least one chain pulled ivory off its
shelves, he recalled.

California Fish and Game war-
den Louise Fiorillo, said: “There’s a
lot of ivory on the market in
California you wouldn’t have seen
four or five years ago,” and war-
dens “get a lot of phone calls
complaining about ivory” sales
from consumers. Merchants call
too, to find out what they can
import, and the agency refers them
to government attorneys.

The intent of the state law “was
to remove the commercial market
for these animals and protect
them,” she said. “I have no ill
feeling against companies selling
ivory,” she added, “but it’s a shame
to do that to the world’s elephant
population. I’d hate to see them
depleted so someone can wear a
bracelet.”

Groveman said consumers often
do not make that connection.

“In these boutiques and exquisite
department stores, the hacking of
the tusks out of these animals while
they lie crying on the ground—I’ve
seen the films—is not associated
with those intricately carved piec-

FORBES - March 1986

Mink-lined diplomacy

C ould furs help warm relations be-
tween the U.S. and the Soviet
Union? The Reagan Administration
thinks so and wants to lift restrictions
on seven imported Russian furs, in-
cluding mink, fox and muskrat. But
Commerce Secretary Malcolm Bal-
drige, who recently pleaded the case
before the House of Representatives,
is running into opposition. The Wild-
life Legislative Fund of America, a

_Washington, D.C.-based combination

of animal lovers and fur trappers, says
Soviet furs could devastate domestic
trappers and wildlife balances. Bal-
drige argued that the USSR. export-
ed very limited quantities of four of
the banned pelts—ermine, kolinsky
(an Asian mink), weasel and muskrat.
No threat there. As for mink, U.S.
ranchers produce the finest in the
world, he said, and export about 80%
of it. American fox trappers, he added,
would not compete directly with So-
viet fox farms. Moreover, he argued,
fur coats now imported from Europe
could be made here with Russian
skins, implying a benefit for the $1.4
billion U.S.. retail fur industry.

 

es of jewelry,” Groveman said.
Consumers “need to recognize
what 18 being sacrificed for the

_ luxury, if that’s what it is, or article

of depravity we choose to parade
around with as a status symbol,” he
said. Once the public remembers
“that it’s not just intricately carved
living jewelry but part of a living '
organism that was slaughtered,
then stores will lose business and
well they should.”

A number of Southland shops
and department store chains now
carry ivory jewelry. One, May
Company, does not, basically for
business reasons, said Board Chair-
man Ed Mangiafico. “We’re just
selling those products we feel are
appropriate and wanted in the
marketplace. There is a lot of
ivory-type stuff that doesn’t come
from natural ivory. Our objective is
to sell merchandise.”

A spokesman for. Neiman-Mar-
cus said, “We are aware and appre-
ciate the concern of wildlife and
therefore we adhere to the law.”

At Man Hing, the San Francisco
shop whose appeal led to the
overturning of the California law,
Wai Au, who said he was in charge
of one of the shops there, said, “We
are still doing ivory business.” His
customers, he said, “like it very
much.”

 

 




LOS ANGELES TIMES - February 16,1986

Once-Outlawed Trade 1n
Elephant Ivory

By PATT MORRISON, Times Staff Writer

Side by side, the newspaper ads tell the
”Story.

- A chastened jewelry shop declares 1n a
Little Tokyo newspaper: “Every year
thousands of wild animals are killed by

:man. [The store] believes jewelry
ashould adorn the human heart as well as
tithe body. Some things in this world are
more important to the heart of man than
an ivory necklace.”

The other ad, from a Southland depart-
ment store, extols “the subtle, fine grain
of pure ivory, creating the most beautiful
of classic and contemporary pieces. . . a

1 perfect complement with the colors of
rSpring.”
The first ad appeared in December,
1981, as part of a penalty exacted by local
prosecutors, back when California’s law
“Barring the sale of elephant parts or ivory
was being vigorously enforced against
boutiques, department stores and galler-
ﬂies. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in

élephant goods were confiscated—some
9f it from the store which later ran the

first ad. The second ad appeared barely
two weeks ago in the Los Angeles Times,
nearly three years after an appeals court
ruled that the federal government’s
less- stringent code preempted Califor-
nia’ s 1976 landmark ban on elephant
product imports and sale.

So elephant ivory trade is back in
California, although the state law against
it is still on the books, a law that once
forced even chic catalogues to warn,
“cannot be shipped to California” beneath

ivory objets.

Called ‘Utterly Repugnant’

Now, three years after the federal
decision halted their efforts, prosecutors
and wildlife agents say they can only
watch as what one called the “utterly
repugnant” ivory trade has been revived.

“California law ran afoul of federal
law,” said Los Angeles Assistant City
Atty. Steve Tekosky, who worked on
some cases involving endangered species.
“That resulted in our prosecutions com-

ing to a screeching halt.”

As a result, said Tom Riley, regional
assistant special agent for the US. Fish
and Wildlife Service, “We have seen
larger amounts [of ivory] coming in. I
wouldn’t say gross amounts, but larger
amounts.”

The rest of California’s pioneering
Brown Administration law on endan-
gered species products—ironically, the

V

inspiration for the federal standard that
now overrules it, Tekosky said—is still
enforceable. Agents can still seize py-
thon, cobra, leopard, sea turtle or other
products. But the elephant products they
once seized—from elephant-hide cowboy
boots to an ivory chess set worth
$30,000—are against state law, but tech-
nically legal under the federal code.

‘Encouraging Unabated Slaughter’

With the new ruling, Tekosky said
bitterly, “We’re encouraging a market
where a market should not exist. We’re
encouraging the unabated slaughter of
the elephants and it’s being done in the
most horrendous fashion."

Tens of thousands of elephants are
killed each year, legally and illegally.

Some of them are shot by automatic .

weapons, some have their water holes

poisoned, and the tusks are sometimes "

hacked out of living animals “like a
frontiersman with a hatchet chopping
down a tree,” said Tekosky, who has seen

films of poachers at work.

“I think we’re very frustrated by the
turn of events,” said Los Angeles City
Atty. James Kenneth Hahn. “We devel-

oped a reputation in the City of Los .

Angeles, we were very tough and very
aggressive on prosecution of those deal-
ing in [prohibited] animal products.” Los
Angeles still holds the US. record—$1
million—for a single ivory seizure.

But the 1983 decision, based on an
appeal by a Texas boot company and a
San Francisco ivory importer, does not
mean that the elephant species is any
better off, said Barry C. Groveman, a
deputy district attorney who prosecuted
many endangered species cases when he
was an assistant city attorney.

“The fact that the law is interpreted.

differently doesn’t mean the animals are

now thriving,” he said. An endangered '.

species products exhibit, partly paid for

by fines from an ivory law violator, is still .
on view at Los Angeles International '

Resumes

Airport.

“All of a sudden, a loophole
comes along and people pay mort
attention to the legality than the
mortality. ” Groveman said
“Loopholes 1n the tax situations are
one thing. This is a question of life
and death for these species, and
nobody really cares, at least these
store owners don’t.”

Under federal guidelines, Asian
elephants—numbering fewer than
40, OOO—are “endangered,” facing
extinction, and no Asian elephant
products can be imported. But
African elephants—numbering an

estimated 1.5 mill:.on—are merely
threatened, “in danger of being
endangered,” said a US. Fish and
Wildlife agent.

Since African elephants are at
risk from expanding human settle-
ment and human predators, Afri-
can elephant pro iucts can be im-

’ ported only under international
‘ permits issued to‘ control the num-

ber of elephants killed, and thereby
protect the species.

But, believes Groveman, the
permits the US. government re
quires to limit elephant ivory im-

ports are sometimes worthless, is-
sued “like credit cards, handed out
to anyone who comes along” in the
countries where more elephants
are killed than quotas or restric-
tions permit.

Unbeknown to retail buyers or
importers, Riley said, the docu-
ments that declare that ivory was
legally obtained may have been
forged or bought.

False Documents

Buyers may not recognize a false
document, Riley said, and even for
U. S. inspectors, “it really is hard”
to determine the validity of per-
mits, although they have samples
of official documents, and some-
times cable for advice to Africa or
to Switzerland, home of the Con-
vention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna
and Flora. _

Horses’ deaths stir

animal abuse charge

 

By Clay Bailey
Staff Reporter

BARTON, Miss. — Marshall County au-
thorities yesterday buried three horses
on Mona Sells’ land and charged her with
three counts of animal abuse.

Ms. Sells, who lives five miles south of
Collierville, is scheduled to appear in
Marshall County Justice Court Monday.

Rather than take her to jail, Sheriff Os-
borne Bell allowed Ms. Sells to sign a $500
appearance bond. . .

Yesterday’s burial came about two
months after several neighbors com-
plained about the dead animals to the

Ms. Sells stood beside the
house and watched as county
employees used heavy equip-
ment to dig a deep pit and bury
the animals. One of the car-
casses, that of a gray mare, was
within 50 feet of the woman’s
“back door. ,

“They got into some badifeed
and got sick,” Ms. Sells said. “I
couldn’t get out for a while be-

nother neighbor, Mary
Emerson, said she was con-
cerned about possible effects on
her own animals. “We’ve got
horses, and it depends on what
they died of. . . If it’s/anything
contagious, I’d hate for ours to
get it.” ,

Ms. Morris and Elston said
they only wanted to help their
neighbor move the animals and
were not interested in seeing

cause I was sick, and the cold
weather brought them down.”

She said she had had the
horses about six years. Neigh-
bors and authorities believed
the horses may have starved to
death.

“She’s got that hay in the ga-
rage, but she’s not strong
enough to move it,” said Mickey
Elston, pointing to , the hay
stacked almost to the ceiling.

Ms. Sells opened the trunk of
her car to show she had several
large sacks of feed. “I wouldn’t
go out and buy feed if I wasn’t go-

 

ing to feed them,” she said. .

Elston and Nancy Morris, who .
live in a trailer near Ms. Sells,
said they didn’t want to cause
problems with their neighbor,
but just wanted to live in their
trailer without getting a whiff of
a decomposing horse.

The horses were around the
house directly south of the cou-
ple’s trailer.

Boy mauled by dog, rescued

A 31/2-year-old boy was mauled by a neighbor’s
dog yesterday before his father was able to jump a
fence and rescue him.

Grady Coley of 1685 Goodlett saved his son, I

Shawn Michael Coley, from further injury by
jumping a four-foot fence and pulling the mixed-
breed dog off him.

The child was in satisfactory condition last

Ruth Ann Hale, Le Bonheur public relations as-
sistant, said Shawn had cuts on both legs, his right
arm and the fingers of his left hand and the groin.
He also had numerous bruises, she said.

Police called Memphis Light, Gas & Water Divi-
sion and learned the resident of 1691 Goodlett,
where the incident occurred, is Darryl Penning-
ton.

Pennington was not home yesterday afternoon
or evening and could not be reached for comment.

The dog was taken to the Animal Shelter for ra-

Coley, who had been inside hishouse working
on a refrigerator, came outside looking for his son.
“I came around the porch and heard him
screaming for me,” said Coley. “I jumped over the
fence and got the dog off. I grabbed him by the
back of the head. He didn’t try to do anything to
me. He had torn all his clothes off and was chew-

ate one very clear win-
ter afternoon, when
there was snow on the
ground and the sun was
dropping behind the horizon
and leaving everything a warm
orange color, I looked up from
what I was doing and stared, as
I often do, through the win-
dow. There is a meadow that
runs off my backyard and,
beyond it, a tree line. In the
distance, a mile or two away,
there is a soft, round mountain.
A small one. It is a pretty view,
and I spend entirely too much
time admiring it.
On this occasion, I noticed

2— something on the edge of my
vision. A movement. It was
graceful and careful. I shifted
my gaze and saw a red fox walk—
ing daintily across the crusted
snow, pausing every few steps

to search, I suppose, for small .

rodents to eat. It was palpable
just how keen and active the
senses of that fox were. He
missed nothing. . . except, per-
haps, the fact that he was be-
ing watched.

I called softly to my daugh—
ters, who came into the room
with me. The older one gasped.
She understood just what a
spectacle. we. were witnessing.

 

The younger child thought the
fox was pretty and wanted to
know if we could catch it and
keep it for a pet. The three of
us watched for a full ﬁve min—
utes, until the fox disappeared
into the trees. And we still talk
about it, a couple of years later.

We own less than ten acres
of land, in the country, and we
live less than a mile from town.
But in our meadow we have

 

seen white-tailed deer, wild
turkeys, ruffed grouse, wood-

, chucks, raccoons, wood
1 ducks, rabbits, squirrels, sev-

eral species of hawks and owls,
all kinds of songbirds, skunks,
and both gray and red fox.

' These creatures have been a

source of awe and pleasure and
even education for my children
and for me. They have deep—
ened considerably the satis-
faction we have taken from
country life.

But they didn’t just appear
in my backyard. They arrived
because of things I did, and
did not, do.

Bringing wilder in close to
your house begins with giving
them something to eat. Like
most people who want to ob-
serve wild creatures, we started
with bird feeders. They were
not as simple as I’d thought.
Our ﬁrst feeders were located
in the middle of our small
meadow. Bad news for the
songbirds and easy pickings for
the hawks. We moved the

. feeders in closer, under the

protective branches of some
trees. The lesson here is that
you aren’t doing the animals
any favors if you expose them
to danger.

Of course, many animals will
not be drawn into an exposed
position. Which is why the tree
line in our meadow is impor-
tant. IfI had cleared it, or even
cleaned it up so that only tall,
mature trees grew there, it
would not offer enough cover

‘ for deer, grouse, and fox to use

it. Even when deer and fox come
into the meadow, they stay

I close to the trees. Always.

 

 

in fact, my reluctance to do
much clearing—my laziness, I
suppose—is one of the real rea-
sons my meadow is so active. 1
do not cut the grass and weeds
that grow there until very late
summer. 80 it is always full of

insects. In the spring and early
summer, all sorts of things
feed on insects. Turkeys, es-
pecially, and we have had as
many as thirty young birds eat-
ing grasshoppers twenty yards
from our back door.

The greatest boon to wildlife
my laziness has produced is
the unburned brush pile. It
consists of limbs from three
trees I took down for ﬁrewood.
I have been meaning to burn
that thing for three years now,
but in the meantime, it has
made a ﬁne home for all sorts
of small furry things, which in
turn, attract larger creatures
such as the fox.

A garden that is indifferently
tended—as mine always are—
is a great draw for woodchucks
and rabbits and deer. Likewise
a compost heap. Alfalfa planted
as a cover is irresistible to deer
in the summer. Ewe bushes,
which are a great favorite of the
landscape set, are especially
favored by deer. I leave mine
uncovered and have seen
Whitetails browsing so close
that only the window glass sep-
arated us. And deer like apples
the way humans like chocolate.
Acorns are better for them,
but the apples are irresistible.
So an old apple tree, pruned
just enough to keep bearing
fruit, will attract deer. And a
pear tree, for some reason,
seems to be even better.

One word here. Don’t put
hay out for deer during the
winter. Their bodies cannot
metabolize it properly. And be-
fore you decide to feed deer, it
is a good idea to check with a
wildlife biologist in your area.

After a while, you will begin
to feel a little proprietary about
the animals that come into your
backyard for food and shelter.
And you will count on the reg-
ular visitors. They will provide
a diversion that you can look
forward to the way subur-/
banites anticipate cocktail par-
ties and city people think about
dinner out. And even if you live
in the tame countryside, as I
do, a glimpse of a white-tailed
deer with her still-spotted
fawn, feeding warily in your al—

1 falfa patch, will do something

for your spirit that nothing cre-
ated purely by man can do.

as likely key
in AIDS fight

Animal carries
virus, but fails
to get disease

 

By Wiliam C. Bayne
Staff Reporter

 

The African green monkey,
which carries the AIDS virus but
doesn’t get the disease, may be a
key in the worldwide search for
an AIDS vaccine, Dr. Robert C.
Gallo .said yesterday.

“There’s some reason it
doesn’t get AIDS even though it
has the virus. We need to find
out what that reason is,” said Dr.
Gallo, chief of laboratory tumor
cell biology at the National Can-
cer Institute in Bethesda, Md,
and the person credited with
finding HTLV-III, the virus re-
sponsible for acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.

In a 90-minute speech to an
overflow crowd of more than 600
people in University of Tennes-
see, Memphis’ Schreier Auditor-
ium, Dr. Gallo traced the medi-
cal research on AIDS and other
diseases associated with retro-
viruses from 1900 to the present.

“Many times the findings were
doubted or were not believed.
And other times the findings
were not viewed as significant,”
he said. Consequently, the fund-
ing for the research see-sawed
until recently when retrovir-

. uses were proved to be connect-

ed with different types of leuke-
mia, cancers and the diseases re-

: ferred to as AIDS by the Centers

for Disease Control.

He said AIDS probably origin-
ated near Lake Victoria in Afri-
ca, but did not spread quickly be-
cause of the relative isolation of
the victims. But he suggested
the African slave trade brought

the disease to the Americas and
7 the Caribbean islands.

AIDS, which in the United

J States is most prevalent among

homosexual men and intrave-

‘ nous drug users, is almost al-

ways fatal.

Dr. Gallo said it can’t be trans-
mitted by casual means and said
the most likely means of trans-
mission are through blood and
through semen. Transmission
through kissing — or saliva ~—
was ruled out except for the
most prolonged kisses.

Dr. Gallo’s appearance was
sponsored by the Memphis
chapter of the American Cancer
Society. /

 




 

    

By Ed Levitt ~
The Tribune

ALAMEDA —- People come to
talk about the death of their dog or
cat. They share guilt feelings. Did
they do enough?

Jayne Langdon listens. She
makes suggestions.

It’s all part of her job as conduc-
tor of a grief support group here for
pet owners. '

“They considered their pets part
of their families,” Langdon said of
peOple in the group. 1

“Then their pets die. And they
wonder if they could have done
something more to keep their ani-
mals alive.

“Talking about it is the best ther-
apy,” she added. “They must con-
vince themselves they did all they
could.”

Langdon, an animal photogra-
pher, has grieved over the loss of
eight pet dogs during her adult life.

Because a dog or cat usually has
a shorter lifespan than a pet owner,
the average person goes through
many pets in a lifetime, said the
1944 graduate of Alameda High
School

“You always hear the same
suggestion: Don’t get too emotion-
ally attached to your animals. But
they manage to snuggle into your
hearts and you’re helpless.”

Only one pet usually touches us
deeply and when it’s gone, she says,
“It leaves a hole in our heart that is
. never filled.”

In some cases, getting another
pet is good therapy, Langdon be-
lieves. .

“But some people wonder if it’s
the proper thing to do. They think

by getting another pet they’re not
quite honoring the memory of the
one that just departed. I waited
three years before acquiring anoth-
er pet. It’s strictly an individual
matter.”

This is one of the key subjects
touched on at Langdon’s monthly
sessions.

“I know what peOple in the grief
clinic are going through. They need
to express their sorrow. That’s why
I started my clinic,” she says.

The people sit around informally
and everyone tells his or her own
story.

“What they need is to have some-
one listen to them who has gone
through the same experience. We
support each other,” gshe emphasiz-
es. '

Langdon maintains she is more
of a guide than a counselor.

“I’m not a psychologist,” she
pointed out. “My expertise comes
from practical experience. I have
dealt with so many pet owners.

Heck, I photographed about 20,000
show dogs during a 10-year period.”

One man, she says, had a Ger-
man shepherd for 15 years. The dog
was suffering from arthritis. He
had qualms about putting the dog
out of its misery. He thought some-
thing might be done medically to
prolong the dog’s life.

“I admired the man for his com- ‘
passion. But he wasn’t doing what
was best for his animal. He had to
let go. He had to put the animal to
sleep. You can’t make an old dog
young.” ’

Langdon’s own special loss was
her pet pekingese.

“Henry died in my arms. I was
devastated. I was with him in Santa
Barbara at the time. I had him em-
balmed, put in a redwood coffin ~
lined with white satin, taken to Ala—
meda and buried in my backyard. I
never quite got over his loss.”

Some peOple can’t understand
how a grown person can love an
animal so much, she says.

“I get upset when I hear some-
one say, ‘You think more of your
animals than you do your family.’

“The relationship between a .
person and a pet is totally different
than between two people. Yet, you
take care of a pet somewhat the

1 way you take care of a baby, keep~

ing it warm and fed.

“The baby grows up to leave
you. The pet stays with you all
through its life. It’s another crea-
ture to talk to and think about other
than yourself.”

Langdon, 60, now lives with four
cats and one dog.

Hundreds of her own photos 0
N

animals decorate the walls and
tables of her Alameda home.
.She got hooked on pets and
pictures when she attended her
first Golden Gate Kennel Show
in San Francisco 33 years ago.
Although without a dog of her
own, she joined the Afghan
Hound Club “because the Afghan
was the most beautiful dog I had
ever seen and dog fanciers are
nice pe0ple to be around.” .
She ended up acquiring an Af-

ghan puppy and shooting animal
oictures.

 

Her photos have appeared in
dozens of magazines, including
the cover of American Kennel
Gazette. Her pictures also have
adorned National Geographic,
Cosmopolitan and the German
magazine Der Stern. -

She has photographed thou-

sands of skittish animals. Her
most difficult assignment?

in with his seven cats and one

’Hearing ear

609’ provides

independence

"By ALAN BERNSTEIN

 

 

,Houston Chronicle

.1

.II‘" V “:

Becky Ann Gilbert, 3 computer programmer for
' the Internal Revenue Service, doesn’t like getting

special treatment for being deaf. Because she can .

speak and read lips, sometimes pe0ple never real-
~ize she cannot hear.
But she is accepting special treatment from

Chrissy — a 22-month-old terrier trained to be a i

“hearing ear dog.“

A few days ago, Gilbert became the first deaf
person in the Houston area to receive a dog from
“Dogs for the Deaf,” an organization in Jackson-
ville. 0re., that identifies itself as the only agency
distributing such animals on a nationwide basis.

From all appearances, the match will make a

_ self-described “independent person” even more in-

,dependent
The 50 or so dogs distributed each year by the

organization are trained to alert their masters

when someone knocks on the door. or when a door
bell. alarm clock, smoke alarm or oven timer is
sounded. Like their “seeing eye” counterparts, the
'dogs are licensed to accompany their owner into
public places. a ; '

Charitable contributions allow Dogs for the Deaf
to provide the dogs free of charge after they are
trained for about five months. The elderly. mothers

,. with infants and peeple living alone are at0p the

, priority list of applications.

The organization was founded in 1977 by Roy
Kabat. who trained animals for appearances in
movies and television programs.

Gilbert, 23, applied for a dog while working to
ward a degree in commercial art at Steven F.
Austin University. She graduated last year and now
lives in a Heights apartment.

“It will make a lot of difference to me,” to have
Chrissy. Gilbert said. “I’ll be on my own, and I’ll
feel a lot better.”

Gilbert’s hearing loss —— cause still unknown —
was discovered when she was 2. Speech thera ists
and family members taught her to speak. rom
there, the Houston native used her ambitious na-
ture to become a cheerleader at Magnolia Junior
High School and a member of the girl's softball
team at Conroe High School, according to her fa-
ther. Joel Friedel.

Although Gilbert does not plan to take Chrissy to
work every day, the dog has already made an
appearance at the local IRS computer center.

 

. The p'mt-size terrier allayed the fears of co—

workers that Gilbert’s companion would be ‘a vi-
cious guard dog.
. With her lip reading skills, Gilbert has become an
interpreter of sorts at the government office. She
reads the lips of speaking workers and relays mes-
sages, through sign language, to deaf workers.
Doreen James, a Dogs for the Deaf trainer who
brought Chrissy to Houston and worked to make
dog and new owner compatible, said the training
“is a never—ending process” in which Gilbert can

teach Chrissy t0 Provideassistance '
daily activities. tailored to her

Texas law guarantees a deaf person’s right to .

have their “hearing ear dog” accom an th
pquilr): plﬁfes, such as restaurants. p y em to

specially trained. And Gilbert now has an idengifi-
cation card — With Chrissy’s color picture on it -

to certify that Chrissy is “a do rofessionall -

THE DENVER POST - Feb. 18, 1986

 

01d llama
not ready to
alpaca it in

By Dick Gillespie
Special to The Denver Post _

COPE — During his long and
productive life, old one-eyed Spec
has been bought, sold, traded and
half-blinded, but he has also had a
harem and pulled out a roping
horse’s tail hair.

He also has been loved, although
that doesn’t always seem to be that
important to a llama. If they don’t
like something or someone they
spit on it, as does their cousin the

camel. And llamas don’t like a lot .

of things.

Spec, who is more than 20 years
old and in his twilight years, lives
on the Muleshoe Lazy Vee ranch
north of Cope. He fathered the nu-
cleus of a 39-member llama family
owned by Dennis Christianson and
his father-in-law, Leonard Pagel.

‘ Their herd has produced award
winners at top livestock shows in-
cluding this year’s National West-
ern Stock Show in Denver.

Spec, however, now is content to
eat and to stick his head through
the window of a pickup to visit with
Dennis’ mother, Leona Christian-
son, who is his best friend. He also
likes to head-wrestle with her
around a corral.

He has a lot of affection for
some people and none at all for
others. Spec always has been that
way.

He was bOrn north of Holyoke,
but was bought as a young’un by
Dale Lasater of Yuma during a
not-quite-sober trip back from Ne-
braska in 1965. Lasater, a Yuma
contractor, decided he needed the
llama and two Korean deer more
than he needed $1,000, loaded them
all in his van and headed for
Yuma, a trip of about 80 miles.

Spec, he said, was all right dur-

ing the haul, but the deer, which
look like miniatures of our native

Species, kept running up his back

and around the van like race hors-
es. They would, he said, keep you
awake.

Lasater arrived in Yuma safely,
unloaded the livestock in his ga-
rage and went to bed about mid-
night. He awoke early the next
morning to one mad wife, Shirley,
and two happy kids, Doug and
Dalette.

The two Korean deer never
worked out as pets.

But Spec became an instant
member of the family, although
Shirley remarked that he cost
more than the birth of either of her
children.

He was the first llama to live in
Yuma so he was naturally invited
into the house for all the Lasaters’
parties. He wouldn’t drink with the
boys, but he would quietly enter-
tain and never got out of hand. He
was more of a gentleman, Shirley
said, than many of their other
guests.

During the day Spec was a con-
stant, unhaltered companion of

Dalette’s. He followed her all over
town, and if Dale or Shirley wanted
to find her they just looked for
Spec’s black and white speckled
bulk.

Spec would also pull a little cart,
but if too many kids got aboard he
would lie down and wait until the
load was lighter. That is the nature
of the llama.

Dale also had a roping horse or
two for his rodeoing, but he
couldn’t keep them around Spec.
Spec hated horses and proved it by
pulling all the tail hair out of one of
them.

Perhaps Spec’s finest hour came
when Dalette was a freshman in
high school. For her initiation, she
made fudge out of his droppings
for the seniors.

Finally, Dale traded Spec to Don
Christianson, Leona’s former hus=
band.

It took some time, but Leona
came to love Spec, and he started
a fairly proﬁtable side business for
Dennis and Leonard.

So things look rosy for Spec in .
his old age —- even with just one
eye.

University teachers send orangutan home

after he learns a few lessons on his own

 

By Scott Thurston
Staff Writer

Researchers taught Chantek, an
8-year-old orangutan, 130 words in
sign language. They taught him
how to dress himself in human
clothes, play with toys and clean
his room.

But in the process Chantek
learned a few things on his own,
like how to Open doors, undo locks,
unravel fences and even short out
electrical wires on a barrier
around the trailer where he was
kept, leading to several escapes.
Chantek became a problem.

So this week, researchers at
the University of Tennessee-Chatta-
nooga put Chantek in an enclosed
van and sent him back to his At-
lanta birthplace, the Yerkes Re-
gional Primate Research Center of
Emory University.

“He didn’t drive the van, but

he did come back,” said Frederick
King, director of the Yerkes Cen-

ter.

Chantek was loaned to UTC as
an infant for the sign language

project. Over the years, however,.

his dexterity and inq'uisitiveness al-
lowed him to devise ways of escap-
ing from his pen.

After one flight to freedom in
1983, Chantek was found inside an
office in the UTC administration
building, where he fiddled with a
phone, ate candy and chewed gum
until a handler arrived.

His escapades became more
troubling as he grew to his current
weight of 85 pounds, and officials
at the urban campus decided he
had outgrown the surroundings.

“It’s all regarded as very hu-
morous when you’re dealing with a
small, cuddly orangutan,” universi-
ty Provost Sandra Packard told

The Associated Press. “But the
same thing with an adult male is
not so humorous.”

Chantek, whose name is Malay-
sian for “beautiful,” is now in rou-
tine medical quarantine at Yerkes,
King said. He said the center staff
has not yet decided whether the
ape will be kept at the 25-acre
Emory facility or at a 117-acre
field station near Lawrenceville.

The UTC project will continue,
he added, with researchers com-
muting to Atlanta periodically.

King said Yerkes has about 10
great apes on loan to zoos and re
search centers and that he has
heard of no similar problems with
chronic escapees.

But he added, “We don’t have
any reason to think Chantek is the
Albert Einstein of orangutans.
They are just naturally inquisitive
and like fooling around.”

Race Fans Hog Wild for Pork Chop Downs

The pigs aren’t specially bred —- thor-
o'ughbreds, so to speak —— just plain old
red Durocs from a farm run by Robert
Bailey of Animal Behavior Enterprises
in Hot Springs, Ark. Bailey is partial to
the Durocs because of their red pigmen-
tation, which makes them resemble
those plastic hog-head hats fans of the
Arkansas Razorbacks insist on wearing
to their team’s football games.

The pigs range in age from 2 to 6
months; in weight from 30 to 100 pounds.

Each race is “pretty much a toss-up,”
according to Bailey. “But,” he says, “it
seems like there’s always one from each

group that tends to bring up the rear. He
decides, ‘To heck with it, I’ll just get
there when I’m ready and get what 1
can.’ They all get fed at the end of it
anyway, so maybe that’s the smartest
pig in the ‘brunch’ for all I know.” Never-
theless, it’s said that the winning pig gets
the prized chocolate-chip cookies buried
in their chow.

The racing hogs are trained by the IQ.
Zoo, founded by Dr. and Mrs. Keller Bre-
land, in Hot Springs. “They’d trained
porpoises,” Bailey says of the animal
psychologists, “and decided training

The I. Q. Zoo people are the same group
who trained chickens to play tic- tac toe
in 25- cents --a game booths which often
are seen at fairs and shopping malls. The
company has been involved in animal
training since 1947, and has been racing
pigs for a decade.

Actually, pigs don’t require a lot of
training, says Bailey.

“The pig is just doing what comes
naturally,” he explains. “A pig is well-
named. From the time it’s born, it runs
after food.”

Physician Also Finds Time

To Operate a Farm-e

By SHEFRAH ANN ROZENSTAIN

HEN Richard J. Kuhn left
his family’s Canadian
wheat farm to study medicine

‘ in California,he looked forward ,
to the day he could take up farming

again. Finally, in 1968, he hung out his
shingle and purchased the ﬁrst piece of
land for his beloved Rancho Ladera.

Today, Rancho Ladera totals 17 acres
and is a 24-hour-a-day, live—in business
for Kuhn —— when he isn’t practicing
medicine. Located on the western edge
of Redlands, Calif, it’s home to Kuhn,
his wife Arlene, who also keeps his
books, and their ﬁve children. Ranging
in age from 14 to 22 years, and including
twin daughters, all ﬁve children are
experienced ranch hands.

Ranching for the Kuhn young people

has meant gathering eggs, walking the-

horses, picking oranges and avocados in
season, tending the family’s vegetable
garden, canning and generally helping
their mother around the house.

~ Kuhn personally sees to irrigating his
orange and avocado trees. A hired hand

dogs and two outdoor cats are also part
of the farm’s popula1ion.

It’s Kuhn’ s horsest hat are the apple of
his eye. “You can t help but love them, ”
he says. “They’re so responsive.”

One proud gray stallion, which Kuhn
describes as “such a charismatic
horse,” was doomed at one time to be
shot because of a shattered right hip. lts
former owner gave him to Kuhn who
personally nursed him back to health.

“Nursing him teok six months and

' meant helping him to stand up every

time by steadying him on his bad side
until he had all feur feet under him, ”
Kuhn recalls.

Today, the horse wears an elevated
shoe and, although. he can’t participate
in any shows because of his old injury,
has sired a line of champion Arabians.

mares, no veterinarian is called. The

Steel-J aw Traps

Of all the bills before the Missouri Legisla-

Senate Bill 634, which would ban the use of
steel-jaw leg traps, probably the most cruel
device ever invented by man.

On behalf of the silent victims and future
victims, I implore everyone to write immedi-
ately to their state senator and/or Sen. Mike
Lybyer, chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, Missouri State Senate, Jefferson City,
MO 65102, recommending passage of Senate
Bill 634.

Remember, traps are not discriminating.

Animal Protection Law

This is in response to your Jan. 17 article
regarding the need for improved animal
care. After reading the original story on Glo-
ria Sutter and her Vanovia shelter, 1 was
shocked. How could anyone arrest someone
for doing a good deed? I, too, felt sympathy.

Instead of asking local and state govern-
ments for money, why not change Missouri’s
strong animal protection law? The animal
protection law makes it difficult for people
to feel compassion for stray and unwanted
animals. When people provide food and wa-
ter to a stray animal, they are regarded by
the law as taking total responsibility for that

animal. They are fined when the animal gets
loose. They also are fined when the animal is
not cared for according to its rules. Missou-
ri’s animal protection law punishes and fines
citizens who take the responsibility off the

taxpayer.

Lab-Grown Tumors

A newly developed technique for
growing cancers in the lab has the “po-
tential for being a real breakthrough in
cancer research,” says Robert Hoffman,
a cancer biologist at the University of
California at San Diego.

Hoffman and his colleagues re-
moved parts of cancerous tumors and
grew them in the lab in a gel matrix that
contained collagen and other proteins
conducive to the growth of cancer cells.

The most signiﬁcant feature of this
technique is that the tumors retain their
most important characteristic: the three-
dimensional structure that they had in
the body.

Hoffman is excited by the potential
of the technique because it offers re-
searchers “a more realistic system on
which to understand cancer and a more
realistic system on which to test chemo—
therapeutic drugs.”

The technique will also reduce costs,
he says, since researchers will be able
to do as many as 50 tests on one culture,
whereas they might be able to do only
one test on a laboratory animal.

Currently, researchers are testing tra-
ditional regimens of chemotherapeutic
drugs on laboratory-grown tumors, but
in the near future they plan to begin
testing drugs that are in development on
these tumors, Hoffman says.

Researchers have grown about 20
different kinds of cancerous tumors so
far, including tumors of the lung,
breast, colon and ovary, he says.

Trapped Animals

in reading the Jan. 26 article regarding
Missouri trapping turkeys to swap for rare
animals, the obvious occurred to me: Why
are these animals so rare in Missouri? Be-
cause we have no trapping laws to protect
them. Traps are indiscriminate, springing
shut on whatever happens to step into them:
dog, cat, bird, otter or human. In Ohio, bea-
vers were wiped out by trappers in 1830. It
took 100 years to replenish their numbers.

Only one-third of the animals caught in a
steel leghold trap are the target animals; the
others are trashed, but subjected to severe
pain as they slowly die from dehydration,
starvation, exposure or simply by biting off
their own leg to escape.

When an article is published about rare
animals, let’s hear the real truth as to why
they are becoming “rare.”

An act, sponsored by
Chelsey V. Morton (R) of
the 47th District, is to be
introduced into the
current session Of the
Georgia State Legislature.
If passed, this Act, titled
the “Animal & Consumer
Protection Act,” would
repeal all conﬂicting laws
in Georgia. It was drafted
by the Georgia Animal
Welfare Advisory Com-
mittee.

This proposed
legislation would regulate
and require licensing Of
pet dealers and Operators

other animal shelters,”
among other points con-
cerning animal welfare
and consumer protection.

Currently, anyone can -

Open a pet shop, kennel,
stable or shelter without a
state license. There are
local laws enforced by
humane societies and
animal control units
which afford a degree of

protection'and regulation.
The laws this
legislation would create

. would be administered by

the Georgia Com-
missioner of Agriculture
and the Department of
Agriculture in
cooperation with the
United States Secretary Of
Agriculture. It would
demand state cooperation
in enforcement Of the
Federal Animal Welfare
Act and any “rules and
regulations issued under
that Act. ‘

The protective

mechanism of the Georgia .

Act would insure the pur-
chaser Of a pet from a
shop, kennel or shelter a
healthy animal.
Requirements for the
Operator of such an enter-
prise would demand that
as a licensee he :

If a dealer is found in
violation of any laws
deﬁned in this legislation
his license can be suspen-

be penalized under
Georgia law. Misrepresen-

Within the medical community a

But when it comes to sheer moral pas-

is seldom unstated, and their cause is fre-

When these two viewpoints on saving

animals (mostly in the rodent family, but in-
cluding dogs, cats, and primates as well) are
offered up on the altar of medical research,
there is a good supply of kindling and plen-
ty of sparks. From Beacon Hill to Wonder-
land Race Track, the issue has long been
joined. And one way to begin to understand
the controversy is to take a ride past fields
and farmland to the pretty suburban town
of Southborough, where at the present mo-
ment some 1,300 monkeys reside.

N THE LOBBY OF THE NEW ENGLAND RE-
gional Primate Center, in Southbor-
ough, a facility funded mainly by the
National Institute for Health and ad-
ministered by Harvard University,

there is a glassed-in cage in which a few

dozen young rhesus monkeys are jumping
about. They are both hilarious and fascinat-
ing to watch, huddling together one mo-
ment, playing tag the next, or staring into a
visitor’s eyes with that strangely familiar
and so disconcertingly human gaze. They
are in that glassed-in cage to learn “social-
ization,” explains Richard F. Rodger, a vet-
erinarian who oversees the handling of ani-
mals housed at the primate center and those
used for research at Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH).

But the rhesus monkeys, along with the
center’s spider monkeys, marmosets, owl
monkeys, tamarins, and baboons—both
Old World and New World primates—are
also there for experiments that can range
from testing new dental-implant techniques
to studying the course of a disease induced
by injections of deadly viruses. But, says
Rodger, the vast majority of the experi-
ments are not “terminal,” and a good half
of the primates just “sit around and breed.”

Asked to make a case for the use of ani-
mals in medical research, Rodger says: “I
don’t know that anyone can make a case
verbally. Walk the halls of Shriners Burns
Institute, or MGH, or Children’s Hospital.
That’s where the case is made. See children
afﬂicted with terrible diseases that can at
least be alleviated so they can grow and lead
a normal existence.”

Rodger’s answer reflects the animal re—
searchers’ argument: Ongoing experimen-
tation is essential to medical advance; and
whether searching for a vaccine against a
virus or developing successful organ-trans-
plant techniques. researchers often have no
choice but to use animals. If a cosmetic is
going to be safe for a person’s face. it must
first be tested on rabbits. If an anticoagulant
drug might help heart patients survive. it
must first be tried on an animal to make
sure it doesn’t have lethal side effects.
Medical history, Rodger says. has shown
that animals are necessary for research.
Sometimes willing human subjects can be
found. and medical science now has com-
puter models to help with predictions. But
there are still times when some animals
must be sacrificed for the good of human-
ity—and, the researchers say. in some cases
for the good of animals as well.

Part of Rodger's job is to examine grant
applications for the use of animals in medi-
cal research. He says the projects involved

 

 

 




 

 

l —— ""‘" ' ‘ and kicking; animals were left unattended;

 

the Massachusetts Society for Medical Re-

are usually carefully thought out and con-
servative. and designed to use as few ani-
mals as painlessly as possible. He cites as an
example typical studies of burns: “A mouse
or rat has to be burned in order to ﬁnd out
how to manage the burn patient. But truly it
is not painful. It’s a full-thickness burn; the
nerve endings die. They don’t feel a thing. I
was horriﬁed until I was educated as to
what was going on.”

Exact ﬁgures on the extent of animal re-
search are difﬁcult to come by, and such es-
timates as exist are widely disputed. The
best guess would be that more than 60 mil-
lion animals a year are used nationally for
scientiﬁc studies: 60 million of those are ro-
dents, with the rest made up of approxi—
mately 750,000 rabbits, 250,000 dogs, and
25,000 primates. Massachusetts alone has
73 research facilities registered with the
federal and state governments, and a num-
ber of others (such as army testing laborato-
ries in Natick) that are not subject to regu-
lar inspection.

So the primate center in Southborough is
something like the tip of the iceberg as far
as animal experimentation goes. Walking its
grounds is an experience somewhere be-
tween taking in a zoo and visiting a hospi-
tal. But there is an eerie feel to the place
that cannot be dispelled by thinking about
humanitarian motives or by pondering the
end results of the research conducted there.
The monkeys at the center are there precise—
ly because they are morphologically so close
to humans, but things are done to them that
no civilized society could possibly let hu-
mans do to one another. Our ability to em-
pathize with a monkey as opposed to, say. a
cockroach might not stand up as a valid
point of departure in a course on deductive
ethical reasoning. but such empathy does
carry emotional. and therefore political,
clout. And that's why what happened at an-
other primate facility. the University of
Pennsylvania’s Head Injury Clinic, sent
shock waves through the research commu-
nity in Boston and around the country.

.\' DO\\’Y\'TO\\".\' BOSTON. [N THE BACK
room of the headquarters of the New
England Anti-Vivisection Society
(NEAVS). there is a small library that
includes a shocking videotape.

In 1984 a clandestine group known as
the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). using
Greenpeace-style activist tactics. broke into
the University of Pennsylvania’s animal re-
search facility and hit pay dirt: hours of vid-
eotapes. shot by the researchers themselves.
depicting some truly horrifying abuse of the
primates in their control.

Baboons were strapped onto torttzre
racks, then inflicted with neck-breaking.
brain-damaging blows to the head. Well.
the purpose of the center was to study brain
injury. so brain injuries had to be inflicted.
But the techniques for causing these trau-
ma: ~ 7»: clearly sloppy: animals that were
s . to be anesthetized were awake

hammers and Chisels were used to deliver
the blows; clinic personnel were smoking,
during operations; a scalpel was dropped to
the ﬂoor and then reinserted into an animal
. . . The images of callousness and shoddy
medicine went on and on and on. The unit’s
director referred to the charges subsequent-
ly leveled against his facility as “false and

distorted,” but the pictures spoke loudly ‘

enough to impel Congress to stop all federal
funding to the unit late last year.

The University of Pennsylvania’s clinic
had been known as one of the best of its
kind in the country. It is now closed.

For Aaron Medlock, executive director of
NEAVS, the video proves a point. He does
not say that medical researchers are sadists,
but he does think that the beneﬁts of animal
experimentation are vastly overstated. He

 

Says Medlock: “Our
whole foundation is
based on an ethical
concern: Can we do
this to animals? We
say no. Animals are
not here to serve us.”

 

claims that much of the research is “dupli-
eative” and “cruel,” and that alternatives to
animal use are not being explored as thor-
oughly as they should be. He says that his-
torical studies commissioned by NEAVS
and his own reading clearly indicate that ex-
perimentation on animals rarely leads to
crucial medical breakthroughs, that such
advances are more often arrived at by hu-
man intuition at work on human subjects.

“You drive an animal insane and then
look at him—that has nothing to do with
mental health,” says Medlock. “And instead
of inducing heart attacks in animals, why
aren’t we trying to stop heart disease before
it starts? Our whole foundation is based on
an ethical concern: Can we do this to ani-
mals? We say no. Animals are not here to
serve us.”

If one accepts that premise, widespread
changes in human behavior would have to
be made, from what we eat to what we
wear. Medlock sees that and sees his orga-
nization’s work as an effort to take human-
ity a step further along a utopian road to
social consciousness raising.

Medlock does not expect animal research
to stop immediately, only eventually. In the
meantime, he is willing to make the most
iriammatory connection that comes to
mind if you believe animals to be spiritual
entities like people: “We call these labs con-
centration camps for animals,” says Med—
lock. “They’re tattooed and gassed—the
parallel is there.”

Anneliz Hannan, executive director of

search, believes that Massachusetts has
been “targeted” by the Animal Liberation
Front for an illegal action. “1 know that. I
think it's coming up." Medlock says he
knows of no such plan but that he would
welcome the ALF if it comes, “because ev-
ery time they’ve struck . . . they’ve had labs
shut down or had labs face extreme federal
intervention. So I hope Massachusetts labs
are cleaning up their acts in anticipation.”

NTIVIVISECTION IS HARDLY A NEw
idea. NEAVS, which is only one of
many animal advocates, has been in
existence for 90 years and has an
average annual budget of
$500,000—money derived from dues. do-
nations, and investments. Medlock counts
6,000 members in New England and 6,000

 

 

 

 

 

more nationally. Yes, there truly are little
old ladies who bequeath big bucks to ani-
mal protection groups. but there are also
sophisticated fund-raisers who will tug at
anyone’s heartstrings with a photograph of
a furry rabbit above a text that reads: “An
estimated 60 to 90 million living animals
suffer each year as subjects of experimenta-

' tion and testing. Dogs. cats, rabbits, mon-

keys. livestock . . . no animal is safe from
the laboratory.”

The political punch of these appeals.

; makes Marvin Hagler‘s left hook look like
Danny Atnge’s. State House sources say
that leg1$lators receive more mail about ani-

mal issues than about any others—abor-
tion, taxes, the death penalty, you name it.

. When animal rights groups circulated peti-
. t10ns in 1984 to force a ballot referendum

to outlaw the use of animals from public
pounds in medical research. an astounding
145,000 veriﬁable signatures were gathered
in 10 weeks. Medical groups saw the hand-
writing on the wall and reluctantly agreed
to support a bill that would stop the use of
animals from Massachusetts pounds in late
1984 and would halt the use of pound ani-
mals imported from other states from Octo-
ber 1986 on. So dogs and cats used in
medical experiments will have to be speciﬁ-
cally bred for research purposes. It is one of
the toughest such laws in the nation.

The maneuvering that led to the repeal of
the Pound Seizure Law reveals much about
the thinking on both sides of the issue. Un-
til 1984 the law said that any animal at any
pound left unclaimed after 10 days could be
sold for medical research. To the research-
ers, their use of pound animals always .
seemed perfectly justified because the law 1
also said that any animal left unclaimed
after 10 days was to be “put to sleep,” as the
euphemism goes. Best estimates are that 13
million animals must be disposed of in l
pounds across the country every year; re-
searchers have been appropriating 2 per-
cent of those. Why breed more animals to
die when‘so many are already on death
row?

But people who run animal shelters have I

an entirely different point of view. “The pur~
pose of an animal shelter is not to supply
the research community,” argues Martha
Armstrong of the Massachusetts Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
(MSPCA). “We are a refuge, a safe harbor.”
The pounds have enough credibility prob-
lems with the public without having pet
owners agonize about turning their animals
over to be tortured, she says. Yes, using
pound animals might be cheaper than
breeding, but the MSPCA is frankly not in-
terested in making medical experimentation
on animals cheap. They would rather it be
expensive, thereby adding an incentive to
do it less often and with the utmost care.
Say “pets” on Beacon Hill, and fine dis-
tinctions get swept aside. Former state sena-
tor Sam Rotondi, who has become a lobby-
ist for NEAVS, says that the medical

Says Powell: “The death
rate from routine
coronary bypass work
on patients has fallen

to nearly zero. That is
directly attributable to
work with greyhounds.”

 

 

community was very smart not to fight the
pound seizure repeal ballot. “They could
beat us on a straight vivisection issue,” he
reasons. “But pets? No way. We had a good
angle on the issue. They used their heads on
that one.”

The next skirmish on Beacon Hill be-
tween the two camps should be very inter-
esting because it has to do with a dog that’s
not often a pet, a dog that (as any trip to
Wonderland Race Track, in Revere, will at-
test) has caused its share of human suffer-
ing—the greyhound.

HE GREYHOUND HAS BEEN IMPOR-

tant to medical researchers for many

years. It has a cardiovascular system

comparable to ours (large heart, the

better to pump blood to run with,
and large blood vessels) and a long track
record (so to speak) of cross-referenced
studies. Moreover, greyhounds are not bred
to be pets; they are bred to race. And those
that never qualify to race at all or that reach
retirement age are, to put it bluntly, ex-
pendable.

Greyhound experiments have led to “per-
fection of techniques used in cardiac sur-
gery,” according to Dr. W. John Powell,
president of the Massachusetts affiliate of
the American Heart Association. “The
death rate from routine coronary bypass
work on patients has fallen in the last few
years to nearly zero. That is directly attrib-
utable to work with greyhounds.”

Animal rights groups see the flip side.

 

According to the MSPCA’s Armstrong. “of

30 greyhounds born every year, only 1
makes it to the races.” The rest quickly
wind up in animal shelters or medical labo-
ratories. MSPCA shelters alone see roughly
3,000 abandoned greyhounds a year.

There seem to be two issues here: how
greyhounds are bred and subsequently
treated, and the use of greyhounds in medi-
cal research. NEAVS’s Medlock ties them
together: “We’re always concerned when
there’s a cheap, unending supply of ani-
mals, because it will lead to waste and
abuse.”

When a bill to ban medical research on
greyhounds surfaced last year, it was beaten
back by the doctors. Noting that Sam Ro-
tondi’s distinction between animals and
pets seemed to hold political water, the re-
searchers wised up and brought in their
own witnesses to provide emotional mus-
cle. For example, one woman testified that
she was alive only because of a successful
heart operation made possible by grey-
hound experimentation.

This year the animal groups have re-
bounded and have again ﬁled legislation,
this time to establish a blue-ribbon commis-
sion to study the use and treatment of grey-
hounds. Rotondi (whose father raised and
raced greyhounds) sees this as a tactical and
practical move. “There are those who are
strongly committed——rabid, if you will,” he
says of the animal rights people he repre-
sents. “They must realize that they have to
work within the system. a step at a time.
[But] you‘ll never get a compromise with
antivivisectionists and strong research peo-
ple. It’s never going to happen.“

He may be right, although reasonable
voices on bOth sides have found some com-
mon ground. Testing a polio vaccine on rats
before it is used on humans appears to most
people to be a more ethically justifiable en-
deavor than immersing monkeys in water
tanks with tubes stuck down their throats
to see how long they can stand it before
they go crazy and die. And few would dis-
agree that society’s goal should be the elimi-
nation of all suffering. both human and ani-
mal. Nor would most people believe that
either group—animal rights activists or
medical researchers—is composed primar-
ily of hypocrites or mentally unbalanced
people, as each group sometimes alleges of
the other.

The pressure that animal rights groups
apply to the medical community is probably
a good thing in the long run. It forces re-
searchers to hone and justify their use of
animals. But both groups could be instruct-
ed by the American Indians’ philosophy:
Eat animals, use animals for all kinds of
purposes. but accord those animals the ut-
most respect in the process. Sadly, it often
seems that bOth medical researchers and
animal rights advocates are interested pri-
marily in cloaking themselves in heroic
robes. But the real heroes, those who do the
real suffering. are the animals them-
selves. D

r. Helen Anderson
D and Dr. Helen Ranney
have a noble Doberman
pinscher named Bismarck.
He is a splendid represen-
tative of one of the first ani-
mals bred specifically for
companion-dog work. That
means Dobies are bred for
the kinds of courage also
known as gentleness and
love.

Unfortunately, not all of
Bismarck’s neighbors
know this. Anderson takes
him on a morning walk
each day. On their route
are a number of other dogs
who have seen the wrong
movies about Dobies, and
those dogs tend to make
accusatory remarks to Bis-
marck. They are not stupid;
the fear of Dobermans is all
too easy to understand in
light of the bad press
they’ve received.

One of the dogs who
used to make unpleasant
remarks to Bismarck was a
female golden retriever.
Bismarck never returned

the insults; he is a noble-
man and forgives others for
their poor judgment. Be-
sides, male dogs usually
know that when a female
takes pains to insult them,
it means she’s interested. I
have tried to explain this to
a number of male humans,
in attempts to bring peace
‘to certain relationships. I
usually fail, but this little
golden succeeded.

One morning the goldie
was in the house instead of
the backyard when Ander-
son and Bismarck came by,
and the front door was
open. The goldie charged
out, and her owner was ter-
rified, both because she
was sure Bismarck would
kill her dog, and because if
Bismarck should fail to kill
her, she was bound to be
killed by a car—there is a
lot of traffic on that street.

What happened was that
Bismarck fell instantly in
love and leaped forward to
hug the goldie around the

  

  

 

 

neck with his front legs, thus simulta-
neously saving her life and opening a
deep relationship.

But Bismarck’s nobility doesn’t al-
ways manifest itself quite the way you
might expect. Bismarck is a trickster.
At least, that’s what some say. I say he
worries about the moral soundness of
his human charges. He feels that peo-
ple should be up and about bright
and early, so he sometimes goes
about the house, poking any exposed
bits of sleeping human he finds with a
cold‘, wet nose and insists that he
needs to go outside, that it is urgent.
As soon as everyone is up, Bismarck
goes back to bed and relaxes.

Some of his detractors say that he
isn’t as honest as he ought to be.
When Ranney is undressing, Bis-
marck waits alertly by the bed, hoping
that some piece of clothing will be
left there. Quite often there is, and he
nabs it and takes it to his bed, for extra
comfort as well as entertainment. The
reason he doesn’t do so with Ander-
son is that this habit of his has caused
her to become much tidier. Bismarck
explained to me that he does this
because he believes that his beloved
Dr. Ranney would be happier if she
kept her wardrobe in better order.
Ranney claims that she is quite happy
just as she is, but as I’ve said, Bis-
marck is from a line bred for serious
responsibility and companionship.

Also, Bismarck’s bloodlines are
American almost from the word go,
and his breeders, Judy and Edward
Weiss of Levittown, N.Y., tend to
breed for a somewhat “softer” dog
than German breeders do. Germany is

the location of a splendid tradition of
serious dog training, and German
breeders and trainers tend to prefer a

“sharper” dog. That doesn’t mean
that German-bred Dobies are nasty—
,far from it.

The truth is a funny thing. I was
talking with a friend who asked my
advice about what sort of dog to get.
She wanted a large dog that would be
easy to train and groom, safe around
her children, and a reliable protector.
I said she was describing a Dobie. She
believed me, but said she couldn’t get
over her irrational terror of the dogs.
She grew up in Nazi Germany, and
remembers Hitler spreading propa-
ganda to the effect that Dobies were
of impure blood and therefore Vicious
and unstable. His generals used Do-
bermans in World War II, of course, as
did the US. Marines, but Hitler’s an-
ti-Dobie speeches appear to have oc-
curred before war broke out.

In any event, a good Dobie from
any line is a dog I’d choose ifI had a
child who needed a reliable pal. D

Cities * COnSidef Chan mfg“. ; "

By BEVERLY POTTER
Staff Writer

7 Because of a report that calls de-
compression an unacceptable
method of euthanasia, Garland ani-
mal control ofﬁcials will recom-
mend that the city stop using the
controversial technique of destroy-
ing stray cats and dogs.

Richardson ofﬁcials also are con-
sidering alternatives to their de-
compression chamber as a result of
the report, said Robert Galvan, the
city’s director of environmental
health. . ,

The study, published in the Feb.
1 issue of the American Veterinary
Medical Association journal, sug-

 

—>

gests that animals placed in a
chamber that has the air removed
will experience pain and distress

‘ before they die.

“We are not going to use a meth-
od that’s not approved by that as-
sociation,” said Pat Fowler, Gar-
land’s director of environmental
health. He said the animal control
ofﬁce will recommend a carbon
monoxide chamber. '

Last year, more than 5,300 ani-
mals were destroyed by animal
control ofﬁcials in Garland.

Galvan said Richardson ofﬁcials
are studying alternative methods
but declined to elaborate because
the City Council has not been
briefed. .

“We’re looking at it right now,
and weire probably going to make
the decision in the next week or
so,” he said. .

The Garland Humane Society
has for some time urged the city-to
abandon its decompression cham-
ber in favor of lethal chemical in-
jections. But the city declined to
alter the method because the
American Veterinary Medical As-
sociation hadn’t ofﬁcially opposed
the use of a decompression
chamber.

After reading the association’s
report and touring animal shelters
throughout the state, Fowler said
he decided to recommend that the
City switch to a carbon monoxide

animal euthanasia

chamber.

Fowler said it initially will cost
the city about $10,000 for an ap-
proved carbon monoxide cabinet,
plus any necessary modiﬁcations
to the room where the animals are
destroyed, including a sensor to de-
tect carbon monoxide leaks. ‘

If the cost of the carbonmonox-
ide cabinet can’t be handled by the
department’s current budget, the

city staff will ask the City Council .

to approve the expenditure in the
1986-87 ﬁscal year budget, said
Denny Wheat, assiStant city man-
ager for community services.

The Humane Society recom-
mends an injection of pentobarbi-
tal sodium as the most effective

way of destroying'animals, but rec-
ognizes carbon monoxide as sec-
ond best, said Bill Meade, director
of the Corpus Christi regional of-
ﬁce of the Humane Society of the
United States.

Fowler said, “I was very con-
cerned that to subject our shelter
employees to the daily handling of
animals and utilizing the needle
and requiring them to, actually
hold death, as it occurs, could be,
in my opinion, psychologically
damaging.”

But Meade said he’s nOt pleased
that cities are settling for second
best and disputes the belief that
administering injections cause
trauma for animal handlers.

Injections are the “cheapest, fast-
est and most humane” way of de-
stroying animals, he said. With car-
bon monoxide, “we really don’t
know for a fact if there is any dis-
comfort to the animal or’not. So
we try to urge groups to go ahead
and go to the best, and that way
you know there’s no pain to the
animal.”

Garland and Richardson are the
only-major Texas cities where
tliaere has been no ofﬁcial decisirm
to discontinue use of the decom-
pression chamber, Meade said. The
society recently has won battles
against the decompression method
in Irving, Austin, Houston, Amaril-
lo, Abilene and El Paso.

HOUSTON CHRONCILE - March 7, 1986

 

 

i Houston’s David Renk and ‘5 other matadors will try'to tame 6 raging bulls in the Astrodome.

Bulliights are back

Ole, Ole! Bullfighting returns to Houston tonight
with six of the world’s most renowned matadors
facing six furious 1,000-pound bulls in the Astro-
dome.

More than 100,000 people attended the World
Class Bullfights held in the Astrodome in February

1966. Tonight and Saturday at 8 p.m. witness the,

drama and excitement as five men and one woman
are face to face with raging bulls.

Bullfighters face all the risk as laws in this
country stipulate bulls cannot be harmed in any
way.

The list of matadors includes Houston’s own Da-
vid Renk, 22. Even at his age Renk is considered a
veteran, having fought more than 40 major bull-
fights since age 14. Mexico’s Raquel Martinez is

 

in the Astrodome

.. the world’s only fully qualified woman bullfighter

or matadora.

Others are Miguel “Armillita Chico” Espinosa
who comes from a family of bullfighters; Diego
O’Bolger of Buffalo, N.Y., one of only seven other
North American matadors; David Silveti, who
makes his comeback this weekend after injuries
suffered in a December bullfight; and Rafael Gil, a
20-year bullring veteran.

Both English- and Spanish-speaking announcers
will help spectators follow the action in the bull-
ring. Tickets are $14, $12, $10 for adults and $6 for
children 12 and under. For more information, call
621-8600.

[If brutal barbarity

I

Flam ‘Kappy Muenzer, president, Citizens for Animal Protection, Houston.

Bullfights will be held in the Astrodome Friday and Saturday evening.
Though the bullfights are supposed to be “bloodless" in the arena, there exxsts
a potential for the animals to be harmed before and after they are used in the

ring.

Even in countries where there is a tradition of b‘ulllighting. there is

mounting criticism of the extravagant cruelty to the animals and the degrad-
lng' effect the spectacles have on the observers. Even the staging of a mock

killing has the potential to desensi-
tize spectators to brutality.
{Bullfighting is not a true sport, nor
’could it be aesthetically pleasing to a
sensitive person. Rather, it is an
anachronistic display of barbarity
that should not be permitted in any
civilized country, and certainly not
staged in one of Houston’s public
sports arenas.

Cruel to rope calves
for rodeo performance

From Kim Chewning, Sugar Land.

Cows feel pain, just like any other
animal. They don’t deserve to be sub-
jected to the agony of “rodeo sports,"
such as calf roping and steer busting.

Please consider my argument. No
animal should have to endure need-
less pain and suffering.

Shaggy dog story

‘ Even if you have not seen the
new comedy Down and Out in
Beverly Hills, chances are
you’ve read about (or seen on
TV) one of its stars, a border
collie named Mike.

Mike is what those of us in the
01’ newspaper game call “good
copy.” I’m not sure what phrase
they use in the 01’ television
game. Maybe “good electrons.”

Anyway, Mike has been get-
ting as much publicity as the
film’s two-legged stars. He’s ap—
parently one cute canine. But.
I’d just like to go on record here
as saying you will not — not, I
say — be reading any interviews
with that damn dog in this col-
umn.

This is not an arbitrary, spur-
of—the-moment decision on my
part. This column prides itself
on providing a free and open fo-
rum for voices of all political,
social and cultural persuasions.
In this space, we have paid heed
to the high and the mighty, the
warped and the woofed, the wet
and the wild, from a former
head of the EPA to a woman
who stabbed her boyfriend in
my driveway. This column takes
on all comers, ladies and gentle-
men.

Except dogs.

Well, let’s be specific. Celebri-
ty dogs.

If that seems harsh or nar-
row-minded, I’m sorry.

On second thought, no, I’m
not.

I have paid my dues, I have
done my time. I have, in point of
fact, already interviewed a ce-
lebrity dog

Inte View, did I say? Folks, I
had lunch with the shaggy little
scene-stealer.

The mutt in question was the
star of Benji.

This was way back in the mid-
’705 when I was making my liv-
ing as a movie reviewer Benji,
for those who managed to avoid
it, was an innocuous “family
film” starring the dog from the
old TV series Petticoat Junc-
10H.

 

The dog’s real name was 0“
gins, but it was changen to
“Benji” to coincide with as
film Ah, Hollywood” i

Benji was made in Texas and
turned out to be very successful

--two reasons why I was more
or less duty-bound to accept
when I was offered a chance to
“do” a story about Benji. Why
don’t you two have lunch, some-
one in the dog’s entourage sug-

gested. A fancy restaurant was
named, a time mentioned.
Haha, sure, I said, assuming
the invitation was a joke.
Haha, here’s Benji, his han-
dler said when the dog was actu-
ally seated across the table from

‘me. A bowl of dogfood was

placed before him. He began to
wolf it up, dog slobber splatter-
ing over his unused silverware,
linen napkin and crystal goblet.

I had the chef’s salad.

I’m sure Benji’s people were
well-intentioned. But these were
people, you should remember,
whose idea of “entertainment”
was having this piddly little fur
ball bounce around the screen
for 90 minutes pretending to be
as smart as a human being. No
doubt, they thought propping up
this dog in a chair and pushing
him to the table to eat just like a
human being would be “good
COPY

Well, I may have been born 1n
Oklahoma, but even I was
raised to bristle at sharing-a ta-
ble with animals. In fact, I think
there’s something in the Bible
about this - something like,
“Cast not your dates and olives
and loaves upon tables whereof
also partake beasts of the field
for this is an abomination and
you’ll probably get dog slobber
on them. ” I think that’s from
Dichotomy 12: 35.

Aside from the religious and
hygienic objections, I was put
off by the sheer uncouth of it all.
At that time, you see, my head
was filled with an inﬂated sense
of my own sophistication and
culture. Here I was a young film
critic, still in graduate school, a
man who knew the difference

 

between montage and misc-en-
scene, who referred to Robert
Altman as “Bob,” who wrote
great larruping commentaries
each Sunday about the state of
contemporary cinema.

Here I was, then, a man who
was not only suffering the indig-
nity of eating lunch with a dog,
but also faced with turning out
some “good copy” about the»
event.

Which, oh shame, I did.

In its own perverse way, the
ordeal had a mellowing effect on
me and helped shake me out of
my grad school elitism. It re-
minded me that you have to
make compromises occasional-
ly, that we all have to have
lunch with Benji sometimes.

But I think once in a lifetime
is enough. So, sorry, Mike. Let’s
not do lunch.

While four million visitors make their ..
way to Hawaii’s shores annually, our
”biggesr” fans by far number about
2,000.

They are the humpback whales who
visit us annually, roughly between De-
cember and May.

Since 1975, the University of Hawaii
Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Labor-
atory, which has led dolphin communi-
cation research through the efforts of
Dr. Louis Herman, has also been Study-
ing the whales, hoping to find out why
they come to Hawaii and the impact
of man’s presence on their behavior.

Paul Forestell, a senior research
associate who has Studied whales and
dolphins for the past 10 years said, “Up
until the 19705, very little was known
. about large whales aside from their
physiology and feeding habits. We
knew norhing about their behavior or
units of social organization."

Herman said, “Our goal was to
describe the whales’ behaviors, their so-
cial groupings and their social needs.”

“If people can develop an ap-
preciation of whale behaviors and

needs, important contributions will be
made in conservation and ocean recrea- '
tion in Hawaii,” Forestell said. '

The marine lab’s concern for the
'whales Stem from Herman’s early Stu-
dies of the humpback in Hawaii.

There was no evidence of the hump-
back’s, a baleen whale’s, exiStence in
Hawaii up to the pre-European contact
era. No mythology or petroglyphs of
the whales exist.

If the whales had been in Hawaii
before the 18th century, Foresrell said
the phenomenon would have been dif-
ficult for the early Hawaiians to miss.

”If they stood on shore, they would
have seen the whales spouting and leap-
ing. Fishermen would» have heard them
sing. The whales’ arrival would have
been an omen that signaled a change of
season or perhaps that fishing would be
good or bad. It’s hard to believe they
would have beenignored. "

TOOthed whales, on the other hand,
were acknowledged with high regard for
their teeth, often used in jewelry for the
ruling class. ' i , "

Humphrey helpers

“Humphrey the Wayward Whale” and other
humpbacks will be the subject of two talks at the
Kahala Hilton Maile Room Tuesday and Wednes-
day, Jan. 28 and 29 at 7 p.m.

The talks, sponsored by Sea Life Park as part of a
“Humpback Whale Awareness Program,” will be
free.

Mark and Deborah Ferrari, a husband and wife
team noted for their work in humpback whale
research, are the featured speakers Jan. 28. The
couple spent nearly 400 hours last October trying to
lure “Humphrey,” the whale Stranded in the Sacra-
mento River, back to sea.

Joseph Mobley, an assisrant professor with the
University of Hawaii and Kewalo Basin Marine
Mammal Laboratory, will be the guest lecturer Jan.
29.

Mobley, a colleague of Dr. Louis Herman, will talk
about the tape recording which eventually lured
Humphrey back to sea.

Seating for the lectures are limited and reser-
vations are required by calling 923-1531.

Whale watching laws

The National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS)

stell himself was caught in has developed the following guidelines for whale
les when watching in accordance with the harrassment of the
a CIOUd Of bubb humpback whales under the Endangered Specues

Act of 1973 and the Marine Mammal Protection Act
close to a mother hump- of1972_

Those who vary from the established NMFS guide-

“All ofasudden 1 sawa lines can be cited for violations of the law with
Federal penalties:
1.

Approaching within 300 yards of a humpback or
herding or driving a humpback whale from any
distance within designated calving and breeding
grounds (within two miles off the mean high water
line from Kaena Point on Oahu east to southeast
to Kaimuku Point on Lanai and all waters inshore
from Hekili Point at Olowalu southeast to Puu Olai
on Maui) is prohibited within 300 miles of Malaea
Bay.

. Approaching within 100 yards of humpback whale,

multiple changes in vessel speed, or traveling
faster than a whale (or the slowest whale in a
herd) while between 100 and 300 yards of the
animal or separating a whale from a calf or herd-
ing or driving whales is prohibited within 200
nautical miles of the Hawaiian islands.

. Flying lower than 1,000 feet in an aircraft of any

kind within a horizontial distance of 300 yards
from a whale is prohibited. This includes hovering
over, circling around, or buzzing whales.

. Any other act that substantially disrupts normal

behavior of a whale is also presumed to
constitute harrassment.
Anyone witnessing whale harrassment is asked to

write the National Marine Fisheries Service at P.O.

building up thick overc-
coats of blubber. As the
water gets colder and food

declines, the whales start
their journey to Hawaii.
While here, the whales
do not feed, but live off

dually patterned. Herman
said phOtographs of
flukes have enabled the

Instead of ramming
into Forestell, the whale
sent out a stream of bub-
bles from his spout. By
the time the bubbles
cleared, all three whales
were gone.

It is rare for large num-
bers of humpbacks to get
together socially, as ba-
leen whales are not parti-
cularly group oriented. A
group of whales, or pod,
usually numbers two or
three.

The principal grouping
in Hawaii is that of a
mother, her calf and an
“escort” whale, which
Herman said is believed to
be a male temporarily
associating with the pair,
possibly to mate with the
mother

The marine lab has also
been studying the whales’
sound production. By now
almost everyone knows
the lab was instrumental
in providing a sound tape
which lured Humphrey,
the whale stranded in the
Sacramento River, back to
sea.

The sounds used were
feeding sounds of whales
in Alaska, which proved
to be very attractive.

For those who would
like to see Humphrey or
any other humpback,
Herman said they appear
in greatest numbers in the
waters between Maui,
Lanai and Kahoolawe.
Early in the season, during
January and February,
they also frequent the
Kona coast of the Big
Island.

Any elevated area with
a clear view of the ocean
offers a good vantage, as
the whales tend to stay in
water that is 600-feet deep
or less, generally prefer-
ring water that is 150 feet
(25 fathoms) or less, in
depth.

Oahu whale watchers
might try their luck in
windward waters from
Kokohead to Haleiwa to
Kaena Point, although
Forestell said chances of
seeing a whale from Oahu
are “not great” until late
March and April.

This was not always the
case. In the 19505, a group
called the Wailupe Whale
Watchers existed on
Oahu. '

“The fact that group-
ings of whales are rare
there now tells us some—
thing," he said.

He does not know why

the whales stay away,
although possible theories
include overabundance of
human activity in the
water or poor quality of
water due to shoreline de-
velopment.

Forestell said he hopes
those who see a whale rea-
lize they are witnessing a
rare event. There are fewer
than 2,000 whales in the
North Pacific area, al-
though it is believed at
least 15,000 were present
before whaling took place
in this century.

The humpbacks are the
third most endangered
species after the right
whale (named because it
was the “right whale to
hunt since they floated,
rather than sank when
they were speared), and
the bowhead.

Whale watchers should
also be aware of federal re-
gulations that apply to
whale watching and tea-
lize it is easy to uninten-
tionally harass a whale.
Forestell cautions:
Keep away, look, but
don’t chase them. If
you’re out on a boat, stop
where you are. If you're
on land, look all you
want."

Remember also, it takes
patience to spot a whale.

Are Acts To Be Prized

By Jo Mannies
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

Wee Gee weighs in at less than
20 pounds, but her small stature
didn’t stop her from fighting off a
knife-wielding intruder who was
attacking her owner.

For that deed, Wee Gee, an
American Eskimo dog, is a co-
winner of the Most Heroic Dog
and Cat Contest, sponsored by the
Humane Society of Missouri
Auxiliary. .

Wee Gee is sharing the honor

‘ with Duke, a German shepherd-

golden retriever, who alerted his
owners Christmas morning that
four men were trying to break
into their home.

Both dogs are from Franklin
County. And Franklin County De-
tective Tom Yoder, who investi-
gated the incidents, said, “Both
dogs had quite a bit to do with
saving people.”

Wee Gee and Duke will each
get a plaque and $25 at a ceremo-
ny April 6 at the Humane Society
auditorium, 1210 Macklind
Avenue.

No cat is being honored be-
cause only 'one was nominated
and its deed was considered less
heroic than those of Duke and
Wee Gee, said Cathy Daoukas,
public relations chairman for the
Auxiliary.

Wee Gee is credited with saving
the life of owner Marlene Bour-
bon when she was accosted Dec. 5

» by a ski-masked intruder in the
’ rectory of Holy Martyrs Catholic

Church in Japan, Mo. Bourbon
was attacked as she came up the

. basement steps. She had been
beaten and slashed by the man
3 when Wee Gee dashed from up
. stairs and bit the intruder in the

leg. .

After Bourbon kicked the as
sailant in the groin, the man ran
out the front door and Bourbo:
called for help. Franklin County
police are still investigating tht
case, and no arrests have beer
made. Bourbon would have beei
killed if it had not been for W8(
Gee’s swift action, Yoder said.

Wee Gee “normally is not a fe
rocious dog,” Bourbon said Tues
day. “She’s only bitten one othe;
person, and they were trying ti
steal sunglasses out of our car.’
Bourbon lives near Bourbon.

Duke, who weighs 80 pounds
woke owners Henry and Myrtlt
Woodcock of Lonedell with hi:
barking about 3:30 am. on Christ
mas. Myrtle Woodcock saw four
mentrying to pry open a'window,
Henry Woodcock fired a gunsho
through the glass and woundec
one of the men. The men fled in a
stolen van. Police captured two
suspects in the van within a half-
hour and have arrested a third
since the incident.

Myrtle Woodcock noted that
Duke had been adopted from the
Humane Society when he was 9
weeks old. “I wouldn’t take a mil-
lion dollars for him,” she said.

Honorable mention goes to Da-
shia, a mixed breed from St. Louis
who chased a purse snatcher and
returned with the victim’s wallet
-- the money still intact.

The Auxiliary also plans to hon-
or Jeffrey Loehr, 12, of Collins-
ville, who jumped into a frozen
lake last month to save a drown-
ing dog. Loehr almost drowned
before he and the dog were res-
cued by two woodcutters. Loehr
will get a plaque and a $25 sav-
ings bond.

 




 

‘ By MARTHA QUILLIN
Tribune Staff Writer

What’s brown, gray and green,
eats river weeds and looks like a
toothless walrus?

The answer isn’tsomething from
“20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,” al-
though Florida newcomers often
think the manatee is, in fact, a fic-
tional character until they see one.
The big, sea-going mammal is a real
part of the state’s wildlife — one
that groups are trying to save.

An estimated 1,000 to 2,500 sea
cows wander the waters off Flor-
ida’s coasts, paddling around the
Gulf and Atlantic Ocean until winter
arrives. As those bodies of water
begin to cool in late fall, manatees
begin searching for warmer habi-
tats, such as the spring—fed rivers
that lace the west coast.

In Citrus and Marion counties,
' the manatee’s favorite sanctuaries

are the Homosassa, Crystal and
Rainbow rivers. The gentle beasts l:
thrive in the 70- to 72-degree ‘”

streams, where they eat hydrilla
that grows on the river bottoms. The
average adult manatee, which
weighs about a ton, can eat from 4 to
6 percent of its weight daily in
aquatic weeds.

During their visit to the area,
manatees are treated as honored
guests. State and federal laws pro-
tect the nomadic animals by prohib-
iting high-speed boating in known
manatee habitats, and divers and
swimmers are warned that while it’s
fine to drop anchor and watch a,
herd of the creatures at play, it’s ille-
gal to molest them.

. Artists who live in areas fre-
quented by the slow-moving swim-
mers have cast their likeness in
everything from clay to canvas.
Paintings, wood carvings and under-
water photos capturing the sea cow’s
homely face and jolly figure are big
sellers at local art festivals.

Preservationists are happy that
the animals are receiving celebrity

status, because that creates aware- ‘

ness and reduces fatalities. The sea
cow has no natural enemies except

man, who kills or injures hundreds
of the animals annually.

Manatees are most frequently in-
jured when they become entangled
in fishing lines or the propellers of
outboard motors.

Scientists studying the manatee
— in captivity or in the wild —- say
the mammal is one of the most gen-
tle animals liVing in the sea. It
adapts from salt to fresh water and
back again without obvious trouble,
and it shows little fear of man. It
sometimes even appears to protect a

diver when the two meet underwa-
ter.

Protectionist groups such as Save
the Manatees, based in Maitland,
have found increasing support in re-

cent years for their fund-raising ef-

forts to assist manatee research. At-
tention from such well-known peo-
ple as singer Jimmy Buffet, chair-
man of Save the Manatees, also
helps. .

So do programs like Adopt-A-Ma-
natee, which allows people to be-
come acquainted with a sea cow on

'a first-name basis. A sponsor pledges

money for research and is provided
with a profile of his assigned mana-
tee, receiving updates as the animal
is tracked by radio transmitters or
recognized on its travels.

Perhaps the best way for people
to learn the habits of manatees and
how to avoid interrupting them is to
see the animals in the wildor in the
enclosed area at Homosassa Springs
Nature World. Canoes and boats
may be rented in almost all areas
where “the vanishing Floridian"
lives.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE — 3/4/86

'A Word
‘ZWith Mike
The Dog

he pOpularity of Mike. the
dog in “Down and Out in
- Beverly Hills." has led some pet
.' ow ners to wonder how their
‘ ow in dog. cat or bird might-go
, on to screen stardom.

To answer this very ques-

tion. a real Mill Valley company

' called Paw Productions. an ani-

j ma] talent agency. recently had
an "animal star search" to select
potential f our-legged perform-
ers who will then be referred to
a Hollywood pet talent agent.
After that. it‘s just being in the
right lap at the right time.

I sat down for an interview
with Mike and his manager.
Max. a gruff. hard-bitten
schnauzer who has parlayed
Mike to stardom.

‘ -' Mike. unlike his screen per-

_jsona.”Matisse,”the spoiled bor- . ’

. (ler collie of Bette Midler and

‘ Richard Dreyfus. is in the flesh

» “a modest. soft-spoken animal
with no discernible ego.

Mike and Max were in town
last week on a whirlwind pub-

; licity tour. so we met for lunch
at Trader Vic‘s. where Mike
wouldn't touch a thing.

“Mike's too excited to eat."

. said Max. "It‘s all happening for

him —— we‘re talkin‘ Rin-Tin-Tin

} GEM 5.0
m mam"

 

7- but the guy‘s paid his dues.
"People think he's an overnight
star. but Mike's been doing sum-
mer stock productions of ‘An-
me for years.”

l. asked Mike about his back-
ground and he said. “It's all in
the press kit. Some guest shots

.\l mu lurked his head to ‘We

. tap-dancing beagle. captivating
the host. a horse called Mr. Ed

McMahon tson of the original

; sit-com quadrupedl.

Max said, “lt so happened

. that a: friend of Paul Mazursky

was w atching the Show. called
the director-and cried. ‘l've
found your Matisse!‘ Paul was
u “convinced. so Mike had to
campaign like mad.”

The interview continues:

I heard you wanted this
'role even more than the Benji
film you lost on final callback.

“That was a heartbreaker.
For this. I read how Whoopi
Goldberg had gone into Spiel-
berg's office and reduced him
to tears when she did part ot'
her act. so I just did my routine
~ rolled over and cocked my

‘ ear and Paul was on the floor.

He screamed. ‘You're my ‘Ma-

tisse.‘ baby. The part‘s yours.‘ ”
What did it? Was it that ir-

rcsistible black spot over one

' eye?
Mike frowned. “A lot of crit-

ics say that, but there's more to

the role than mere looks. You

have to become Matisse. I im-
mersed myself in the part. like

De Niro and Streep."

Was it tough on the family?

“I was insufferable. They were
great. I couldn‘t have handled the
day-to-day pressure without their
support.”

How was it working with es
tablished stars like Midler, Nolte

and Dreyfus? Were they threat-
ened by you. afraid you’d steal big

scenes?

“Never. It was like a family.
They couldn’t have been kinder.
You expect your Bette Midlers and
your Nick Noltes to be these huge
stars. but they‘re just humans. I'd
blow a line and we‘d all break up. It
was a very relaxed set."

Max here says you do 110
tricks — he calls you the next
Houdini. What really captivated
me was how you pick .up your dog
dish and hurl the food over one
shoulder.

“That one came easy. I'd~ done it
for years, on my own. but I just
needed the right vehicle."

What was the toughest scene
- pushing the security button.

. putting a paw over one eye as if

scared, the tai-chi bit or faking an
orgasm?

“Standard stuff in dog-biz."

Did you use a double in the
scene where you run over hot
coals?

LETTE as}
Stop Scientists

From Using Animals

What is the matter with the people in
this world that we allow researchers at
the University of Florida to drown 22
dogs?

' It is time every citizen spoke up and
put a stop to all research and experiments
by scientists who use live animals.

We must force them to stop by what-
ever means necessary. We as taxpayers
should see that all monies for this purpose
are taken from them.

Just think of the horror and unbeliev-
able pain these people cause.

God put dogs and other living things to
be our friends on this earth, and not for
torture and experimentation.

Menageries Have
Poor Animal Care

Jeanne Roush, director of captive
wildlife protection for the Humane Soci-
ety of the U.S., has brought to my atten-
tion the fact that many animals are being
cruelly forced to live their lives in Flor-
ida’s roadside facilities in grossly inade-
quate circumstances. . ,

At one central Florida zoo, Roush en-
countered a raccoon residing in a cage
measuring one square yard. One monkey

shelter wasn’t even tall enough for the
animal to stand up in. A gorilla was occu-
pying a modified tractor-trailer with no
access to sunlight.

Without adequate funds, some menag—
erie owners are forced to rely heavily on
public feeding. Others depend on day—old
doughnuts and donations from local res-
taurants. The owners don’t have to spend
much on food if they can fatten the ani-
mals on junk.

These places in Florida are a dis-
grace. A tourist wrote to the Humane
Society and called what she saw “a living
death.” Is this what we want our tourists
to see? By not doing anything, we are
sanctioning this despicable picture of our-
selves as Floridians.

People should not patronize these
places. They should let the director of the
Florida Division of Tourism know of their
intentions’to boycott these exhibits. Tell
him that the presence of these shoddy fa-
cilities detracts from Florida’s glossy
vacation image.

We can do something if we all pull to-
gether.

Drowning Dogs ls

Cruel, Unnecessary

The plans of the University of Florida
to drown dogs to see if the Heimlich
Maneuver of external chest compression
is the appropriate treatment for victims
of near-drowning accidents is most ap-
palling. Perhaps even more shocking is
the plan of the American Heart Associa-
tion to sponsor this program.

I asked for a copy of the statement re-
garding this cruel plan from the Amer-
ican Heart Association. In this statement,
the following guidelines are used regard-
ing use of animals in research projects
which they sponsor:

Care and use of animals is carried out
by qualified individuals.

Supervision by a veterinarian.

Research should use alternative meth-

ods to live animals when appropriate.

Post procedural care must minimize
or relieve discomfort.

Research should avoid all unneces-
sary suffering, and must terminate if con-
tinuation would result in unnecessary
pain or fear.

Drowning is a terrible way to die and
to induce this fate to these helpless dogs
certainly would result in unnecessary
pain or fear.

Also, Dr. Heimlich has personally de-
nounced this experiment as unnecessary.

Since this program is going to need
funding from the American Heart Associ-
ation, I would recommend that readers
who are sympathetic to animal rights sus-
pend now and forever any and all contri-
butions to the American Heart Associa-
tion. As a donor to the American Heart
Association over the years, I certainly will
suspend my contributions if they indeed
fund this. '

For the University of Florida to ap-
prove this program as requested by Dr.
Richard Melker is beyond comprehen-
sion. The university is a state-supported
school, partly paid for with tax dollars.

As a taxpayer, I strongly resent this
plan and have asked legislators in my
area to pressure the university to put
aside this foolish project.

.How can the drowning of a dog prove
anything but cruelty? Is Dr- Melker going
to administer mouth-to-mouth to these
dogs as a comparison to the Heimlich Ma-
neurver? To protest this stupid plan, all
alumni to the university should suspend
their contributions until these plans are
cast aside.

J .R. HERRON
Tampa

Public Pressure Can
Make a Difference

The recent temporary cancellation of
a proposed experiment on 22 dogs at the
University of Florida proves the effective-
ness of public protest. However, the pub-
lic should keep the pressure up by writing
or calling the president of the university.

One "way of stopping cruelty is to cut
off the funds that promote it. Since the
American Heart Association has been
considering funding this cruel project, it
should hear from all animal lovers.

The same intense public pressure to
cut off funds must be applied in the case
of the wild horses and burros. Unless this
is done, the Bureau of Land Management
will spend $15.6 million on the 1986
roundup of 17,000 more of them, and they

will eventually go for slaughter.

Senator James McClure and his anti-

wild horse cronies must be stopped. They

are to be faced in a Senate-House confer-
ence by Reps. Sidney R. Yates and Ralph
Regula. All humanitarians are urged to
write to these two representatives and tell
them not to waste tax money to round up

. these animals.

Heimlich Manuever

Use of Animals

ls Sick and Ugly

This is in regard to drowning dogs to
prove the effectiveness of Dr. Heimlich’s
maneuver as opposed to mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation.

Man’s use of animals for research is
dark, evil and ugly. Animals give us so
much and we repay them with agony and
terror.

, The American Heart Association is
seleking $18,000 for a crime against every-
thing that is good. But I think that amount
is a bit much to drown 22 helpless dogs.
After all, the water is free.

As English writer John Cowper Powy
said, “Torturing animals to prolong
human life has separated science from
the most important thing that life has pro-
duced — conscience.”

Fatal chase
Drug Search ends with a dead dog

By BRENDA GILCHRIST
Free Press Staff Writer

Harry Sakjas Jr. is suing three Livonia police-
men, claiming they relentlessly and unnecessari-
ly chased his long-haired German shepherd,
Duke, until the dog collapsed in the bushes and
within two hours died of a heat stroke.

Duke was chased by the officers, the lawsuit,
states, on July 8, 1985, the day the officers came
to Sakjas’ home with a warrant to search for
drugs.

“If my dog were still alive now, I would have
gone on with my life,” said Sakjas, 26, of
Dearborn Heights. “The dog was really beautiful.
He was my only living possession. '

SAKJAS, WHO SAID he paid $200 f0r Duke,
said neighbors told him the officers made a “big
joke” of taking turns chasing the 31/2-year-old
dog for 30 to 40 minutes in 90-degree heat.

When Duke tired, the officers would let him
rest for a few moments before resuming the

 

chase, which ended when Duke collapsed in the
bushes, the suit states. An autopsy showed the
dog died of heat exhaustion, said Thomas Davis,
attorney for Sakjas.

Sakjas is suing the City of Livonia, its police
departmentand officers John Golembiewski,

'Gary Sitner, Jeff Perkins and Harold Pryor, an
animal control officer. They could not be reached
for comment Monday. An assistant city attorney
said he was not aware of the incident or the
lawsuit.

Davis said he did not know why the officers
were chasing the dog. However, Davis said,
Pryor, in a report, stated he was asked to
impound the dog because the house had to be
secured after two other occupants were taken
into custody. .

Sakjas, an instrumentation designer for Ford
Motor Co., pleaded guilty to possessing a small
amount of marijuana.

But, he added, Duke had nothing to do with ~

the marijuana charge and was not a threat to the
officers.

“They didn’t have to go after the dog,” said
Sakjas. “He was an innocent party.”

Hearing Is‘Scheduled Today
In East Point Dog Bite Case

By DAVE HAMRICK

A hearing is set for 2 pm. today
on charges against the owner of a
pit bulldog that attacked an el-
derly East Point man and an ani-
mal control ofﬁcer recently. -

J. F. Anderson of LaRose Street
was bitten severely on his wrists,
according to police, when he went
to the aid of Charley Brown of
Fulton County Animal Control,
who also was bitten by the dog.

Witnesses said the dog bit
Brown as he approached the house
to discuss a complaint ﬁled by
neighbors about dogs at the house.

According to police, the dog was
kept on a long chain. Anderson
came from across the street,
calmed the animal and told it to
sit, according to police, but when
he started for the house, the ani-

mal attacked him as well.

A neighbor said Anderson had
surgery and was scheduled forfur-
ther surgery this week.

Meanwhile, Hanna Hudgins, an-

other LaRose neighbor, visited a
meeting of the East Point City
Council Monday to ask that city
ordinances concerning animal con-
trol be enforced.

She said that Mary Abna, owner
of the pit bulldog, also owns more
than the legal limit of three pets,
and that neighborhood complaints
that brought the animal control
officers to the area had been aired
before with little result. ,

The city has a contract with the
county’s animal control unit to
provide dog catching service in the
city, but enforcement of leash laws
and other animal-related laws

“Some people are not happy
with the dog service that we‘ve
gotten from Fulton County,” said
Kinnett. “I’d like to talk about
going back to having our own dog
wagon in East Point,” he added.

'In the hearing today in East

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - Feb. 27, 1986

Stop The Dogs —-— Now

The case to be made against adding dog
racing to Missouri’s panoply of gambling
tricks is simple —— and it’s not the one
being used by opponents of this “sport” in
the debate before the Legislature.

It is to take such serious steps as intro-
ducing each form of gambling in the state
very, very cautiously. Horse racing has not

yet been started anywhere in the state, and.

already the Senate, following the leader-
ship of President Pro Tem John E. Scott of
St. Louis, has reversed itself and voted for
a constitutional amendment allowing dog
racing. The House must approve the mea-
sure before it can go to statewide vote.

Yet the Horse Racing Commission,
which would be given jurisdiction over dog
racing, has no real idea of the problems

and material benefits to be gained from
pari-mutuel horse racing. What can it
know about dog racing? And what can the
public, which should give approval if it

mustbe given, know about the morality,

economics and atmosphere generated by
dog racing?

The Legislature should concentrate on
matters of more immediate importance in-
stead of rushing willy-nilly into approving
a proposed constitutional amendment with
the potentially misunderstood impact of le-
gal dog racing. Next thing you know, mem~
bers of the General Assembly will get the
idea that all they have to do to represent
the people is to pass more gambling mea-
sures in one form or another and to heck
with the tough stuff.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - March 8, 1986

Authorities stage raid on house
teeming with 100 killer reptiles

Officials found cobras, copperheads and
other lethal animals valued at $10,000

along with dozens of weapons.

SAN FRANCISCO (UPI) — A
“mind-boggling” collection of
more than 100 exotic poisonous
snakes and lizards — some of the
world’s most dangerous and rare
— were found in a raid at a house
filled with the killer reptiles, au-
thorities said Friday.

Cobras, copperheads, boa con-
strictors, rattlesnakes, a tiger
snake, a Gila monster, scorpions
and other illegal lethal animals
were discovered in aquariums, ter-

 

rariums, wooden boxes and other
assorted containers spread
through the two-bedroom house.
“They were all over the place,”
Rich Avanzino, president of the
San Francisco Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to. Animals, said.
“These are some of the most
dangerous and most lethal animals
known today. Some are so rare
and venomous that they make the
possiblity of death for any of their
victims rather probable. It was a

very scary situation and we had to
handle them with extreme cau-
tion.”

The snakes were up to 4 feet
long with the potential to grow
much larger. ‘

The raid was carried out —
with “extreme caution” — by 25
agencies, including agents from
the federal Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco and Firearms and a police
SWAT team Thursday night,
prompted by a tip to the SPCA.

The apparent resident of the
house, Bruce Feldhammer, an em-
ployee of a Daly City store that
specializes in reptiles and exotic
animals, drove away moments be-

fore the raid. A warrant was issued
for his arrest.

Besides the dangerOUS animals,
whose value was estimated at
$10,000, dozens of weapons, includ-
ing a grenade, pistols, riﬂes and
machine guns, were found in the
residence.

 

Also recovered were file cabi-
nets full of documents dating from
the 19605 that officials said could
lead to a widespread investigation

of illegal snake trafficking.

.“,.We believe there’s every pos-
siblity that this bust is going to be
one of the biggest major raids on
the network of those illegally traf-
ficking in venomous snakes that’s
ever happened in this country,”
Avanzino said.

Authorities used a battering
ram to break down the door of the
house, conducted a “painstaking
search from top to bottom” and
took the illegal reptiles away in
four rescue vehicles, under police
escort, Avanzino said.

Animals Vs. Subdivisions: Seminar 0r] ow Vi‘e {lope

By Peter Hernon
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

When the wildlife gets a little too
wild, the consequences can be costly
to homeowners who have to fend off
raccoons, bats, snakes and other crit-
ters that can make themselves at
home in urban sprawl.

A squirrel that chews into an .attic
can do serious damage. On a more
painful level, so can a brown recluse
spider that hides in a closet and bites
a hand groping for a shoe or
bathrobe.

It’s not unusual, wildlife experts
say, to see sparrow hawks smack in
the middle of south St. Louis. Gray
foxes have been observed on the
edges of population centers in the
county. And bats aren’t limited to bel-
frys; they can be seen everywhere.

As urban expansion claims more
countryside, diminishing the habitat
for these and other animals, it often
means close and unfriendly encoun-
ters with wild animals, conservation
officials say.

In fact, emergency calls about
wildlife have become so numerous
recently that the Missouri Depart-
ment of Conservation has decided to
hold a public seminar to try to deal
with it.

The title of the free session, set for
today at the Ridgway Center at
Shaw’s Garden, is: “Wild Animal
Problems in the Urban Area.”

The subjects include “Stinging In-
sects &. Biting Spiders”; “Bird Con-
flicts”; “Conflicts with Large Mam-
mals and Turkey”; and “Introduction
to Snakes.”

The rats live in a sterile environ-

Although the program is aimed at
professionals from humane societies
and extermination companies who
have to make house calls, it is also
open to the public. The session is be-
ing held in cooperation with Shaw’s
Garden. It starts at 8:30 am. and ends
at 4:30 pm.

The conservation department’s
Dave Wissehr likened the food supply
for creatures in metropolitan areas to
a “smorgasbord.”

Careless outdoor feeding of dogs,
cats and other pets often means a
tempting supply of loose food within
easy reach, he said. Then, too, gar-
bage and trash cans are easily tipped
over and opened by foraging animals.

Wissehr said homeowners were le~
gally entitled to destroy any wildlife
that damaged their property.

Bats are a particularly thorny prob-

on lists of endangered animals, and
certain bat-killing poisons are illegal.
Besides, as Wissehr says, ‘Bats are
really beneficial to humans in the
long run.”

Wissehr has had his own problems

Rabies vaccine found; getting __ ‘~
raccoons to take it is a problem

By ERICH SMITH
Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA — Scientists at
the Wistar Institute have a vaccine
to control a rapidly spreading out-
break of rabies in raccoons. Now
they are trying to figure out how to
make the raccoons take it.

So far it seems feta cheese, shell-
fish oil, turkey gravy, wild grapes
and bananas are the tastes that rac-
coons really go for. Wistar hopes to
use the smelly stuff some day to help
spread its oral rabies vaccine to rac-
coons in the wild.

Rabies, a deadly disease to
humans, has been spreading among
raccoons from West Virginia toward
the Northeast for about six years.

“It’s our No. 1 problem,” said

Bruce Reimer, a spokesman for the

Pennsylvania Health Department, '
which saw its number of animal :

rabies cases jump from 19 in 1980 to
168 in 1983 and 450 last year.

Skunks are the main carriers of
rabies in the Midwest, and Canada is
fighting the disease in foxes; the rac-
coons are a new and different prob-
lem. '

Groups take aim
against leg traps

inj urin

By Connie Thompson
Northeast Ark. Bureau

 

 

KENNETT, Mo. —— Animal
rights advocates are raising a
stink — literally —— over the use
of steel leg traps that they say in

flict unnecessary pain on ani-

mals.

Several state humane soci-
eties, including the Bootheel of-
fice in Kennett, are backing a
bill that would outlaw the use of
steel leg traps and similar de-
vices in Missouri.

The matter was brought to a
head last month when a prepo-
nent of the bill pulled a skunk’s
carcass from a bed of dry ice dur-
ing a state senate agriculture
committee hearing. Members
were evacuated from the room,
said Sen. Stephen R. Sharp (D-
Kennett), vice chairman of the
agriculture committee.

Other senators on the same
floor of the Capitol building
caught a whiff of the animal’s
scent, and they too left the build-
ing, he said.

animals

“The smell was just about gone
in two or three hours, but we all~
had to“ get our suits cleaned,”
Sharp said.

The woman who brought the
skunk to the hearing had intend-
ed to show the senators how
steel leg traps injure animals.

“There had been some discus“
sion as to the use of a human-e
trap which supposedly doesn’t
hurt the animals, but it was nev-
er thoroughly developed before
the skunk was produced,” Sharp
said.

The skunk further delayed dis-
cussion of the bill, which prot;~
ably won’t make it out of com
mittee during this senate ses-
sion, Sharp said.

If the proposal, State Senate
Bill 634, were to become law, it
would require trappers to use al-
ternative devices which hold an-
imals securely but don’t crush.
the bones and tendons, said
Bootheel Humane Society Presi-
dent Elaine Garrison.

She said the painless traps
would protect domestic animals
from injury.

 

 




THE BOSTON GLOBE - February 28, 1986

. The

FREMANTLE, Australia -— On not seeing
kangaroos:

“Are there any other questions we can an-
swer for you?" asked Warren Pateman, an
amiable fellow from the Bureau of Tourism
for Western Australia.

“Just one." I told him. “See, I figure as
long as I'm over here . . . well, I'd really like to
see a kangaroo."

“Want to see kangaroos, do you?” Warren
Pateman chuckled loudly. ”If you're around
here a while, you‘ll see a kangaroo, all right.
Bloody things are so thick here' now you
can’t get away from ’em. You just come down
to my golf course, you'll see the bloody kanga-
rOos all right.”

But that's not the way it happened. Day

led into day; no kangaroo. Now, admittedly. I.

spent a fair amount of time on the affairs of
the waterfront, but then I went inland a good
deal as well. I rode my bike back into the
country. all over Rottnest Island. 1 took a tour
down to the Margaret River winery on Cape
Leeuwin. a lovely rich south coast bush coun—
try that looks like Africa‘s Serengeti Plain.
And everywhere I went, people assured me,
”Oh, you'll see plenty of roos. You won’t be
able to get away from the bloody things.”

But then another day would be gone, and
no roo. I turned over rocks to find sleeping
tarantulas. saw thousands of thorn birds,
nambats, quokkas and, out in the sea, leap-
ing dolphins, but no roos.

One night in the Auld Mug Tavern, I was
talking with a fellow named Bob Harris who,
after fighting in the war. left Australia for
Canada where he beeame a boat—builder and
passage-maker, and who had developed
years of wonderful yarns about his travels.
Late in life. he said, he had decided he want-
ed to die under the Southern Cross, the domi-

nant summer constellationof the Southern
Hemisphere that means home to an Aussie. It
sounded so romantic on a late night in The

Auld Mug. I asked Bob Harris to point the

, constellation out.

”You mean you haven’t seen the South«
ern Cross? Well, come with me.”

We drove out a bit to get away from the
lights of downtown Fremantle and the water-
front. We got out of his car and. in a field, he
pointed straight up, just a. little west. There.
overhead in a summer sky you could touch if
you were just a foot or so taller, werethe five
stars of the Southern Cross, the constellation
that the great wool clippers steered by. "that
lured sea adventurers such as Captain
James Cook and Joshua Slocum.

The Southern Cross was a lovely and in-
spiring-sight, I told Harris. Something I had
really wanted to see in Australia.

But there was one thing.

“You know." I confessed to Harris. ”I've
been here two weeks now and I haven’t seen
a kangaroo.”

“A kangaroo!” he roared. “Why those
bloody things . . . we'll be lucky if we get back
into town without hitting one on the road.”

While I waited patiently, I collected as
much information as I could about bloody

- kangaroos. _
Cars that travel outside the cities at. all

come equipped with heavy steel piping called

. “roo bars" in front of the bumper. Austra-

lians drive more slowly at night because of
the probability of finding roos on the road.

The entire country. some Aussies will tell
you, is being overrun with kangaroos, largely
because they are protected by law and have
such ingenious biological protection. A preg-
nant female roo can actually choose her sea-
son to give birth, thus avoiding droughts, the
most. threatening natural disaster here.

So after a few very dry seasons, when the
rains do come back, the roo population ex-
plodes, as it has in Australia this year. These
marsupials, which grow to well over 200

e elusive 1008

pounds, eat tens of vegetation and do not dis-
criminate against farmers’ crops.

The Aussies are protective of their roos,
but because the population has begun to ex-
plode out of control professional marksmen
have been hired to “cull" the population by
about 3 million animals. The meat is used in
making cat food.

Which brings up an interesting aside.
When a familiar fast-food chain established
itself in Australia a few years back. a rumor
got around that the burger meat had kanga-
roo in it. Such rumors were just the stuff of
raving teen-agers, of course. but a similar ru-
mor is still going around in. Australia —- roo

. meat being exported to the Yanks.

For the record, kangaroo meat, especially
from the small grey species of roo. is said to
be delicious.

However. there are strong animal rights
forces at work in Australia that keep roos
from ever being hunted generally. Aussies
are not hunters by nature. and roos would
not be good sport. if hunting a moose is like
shooting a ’67 Buick, roos are more like Alfa
Romeos. When approached by a human. they
tend to stand and watch for a while.

The big red roo can be a dangerous fighter
in its defense, hence the famous boxing kan-‘
garoo symbol adopted by the Australian
America’s Cup Defense '87 team. A wise dog
will not go near one. Provoked to anger, the
roo will grasp its foe in its fore paws and rip
away with the huge claws on its tremendous-
ly powerful hind legs.

Those legs, incidentally, propel a peram-
bulating roo about 30 feet per jump.

“You know as much about kangaroos as
most Aussies," said my companion in The
Auld Mug one recent night when we got into
roo talk.

”Yuh,” I began, “but you see, here’s my
problem . .

Couple puts
turtle repair
on fast track

 

By John Beifuss
Staff Reporter

 

George and Donna Heinrich
have come out of their shells to an-
nounce their profession, pursuit
and passion to the world.

Said Ms. Heinrich: “We fix
broken turtles.”

For the past two years, the Hein-
richs have been refining tech-
niques to repair the shells of tur-
tles and tortoises that were in the
wrong place at the wrong time —
and the wrong time can be a long
time for a turtle, which needs
more than a two-minute warning
to get out of the way of oncoming
traffic and evil-eyed youngsters.

“People just see a broken turtle
and think he’s going to die,” Ms.
Heinrich said. “The public needs
to know there is a place for turtles
to be taken.”

That place is the Lichterman Na-
ture Study Center, 5992 Quince,
where Donna Heinrich is an ani—
mal rehabilitator. George Hein-
rich —— a lifelong turtle devotee
whose parents bought him “exotic

tortoises” as a reward for good
grades —- works in the reptile

house at the Memphis Zoo.

Today, however, is the Hein-

richs’ last at their jobs. This
weekend they’re moving to tur-
tle-rich Florida. They never
sought publicity, but now they
want people to know their work
will continue at Lichterman,
where employees have been
trained in the Heinrich school
of turtle repair.

Heinrich said turtle repair has
“gone all the way from masking
tape to fiberglass and epoxy.”
And, though it sounds funny,
that’s serious ecological busi-
ness. By saving individuals, tur-
tle repairmen are aiding vanish-
ing species.

“Turtles and tortoises are just

part of the overall web which
people are part of,” Heinrich
said. “It’s like a wheel —-. if an
animal species vanishes, it’s like
a spoke has disappeared. After
enough spokes disappear, the
whole structure weakens. You
can have ecological collapse.”
. Of course, this line of work
doesn’t bring much fame, except
at the annual conference of the
National Wildlife Rehabilitators
Association last month in Bos-
ton, where the Heinrichs pre-
sented their paper: “A Tech-
nique for the Repair of Chelon-
ian Shell Fractures, with a His-
torical Review of Shell Fracture
Repair.”

“Chelonian” is to turtles what
“bovine” is to cows.

“They seem boring, but turtles
are real interesting animals,”
Heinrich said. “They just move
so slow — sometimes they don’t
do anything for about a half an
hour. But if you have the time to
watch ’em, it’s really interest-
ing.”

In Florida, the Heinrichs will
work with the raré gopher tor-
toise. The burrows made by this
tortoise are inhabited by many

 

other creatures, such as snakes
and sand owls. “So if you can
save one tortoise, you’re actually
saving 18 or 20 other animals
that use its burrow,” Heinrich
said.

He said repaired gopher tor-
toises may be fitted with elec-
tronic transmitters, to “see if
males accept females with fi-
berglass across their shells.”

The Heinrichs have expanded
on work done by Dr. Fredric
Frye at the University of Califor-
nia-Davis. “We have taken a ve-
terinary surgical technique and
changed it so it can be applied by
lay people,” Ms. Heinrich said.

They repair shells with fiber-
glass cloth, like that used to re-
pair cars, and epoxy. The materi-
als are applied in three layers,
forming a sort of fast-drying
patch over the wound. ,

After it dries, it must be re-
moved from young turtles be-
cause the shell —- which is bone
covered with fingernail-like
scales — is alive and growing.
“Otherwise, the young turtle
would suffer deformity,” Ms.
Heinrich said.

The Heinrichs ultimately hope
to apply their techniques to
brackish water and marine tur-
tles. They also plan to experi-
ment on broken shells with den-
tal acrylics and horse’s hoof-
repair material.

And, for the Heinrichs, turtle
work has been fulfilling on
more than a professional basis.
George and Donna married in
December after having worked
together in turtle repair for
many months. “So you could al-
most attribute that to the tur-
tles,” Ms. Heinrich said.

And since then, in the words
of the song, they’ve been “Happy
Together.”

 




FORT WORTH STAR-TELEGRAM - March 9, 1986

New ’porenfs'
eagerly give
horses 0 home

By JANE MARTIN
Star-Telegram Writer

The Brantleys are city slickers with five acres
in the country.

Rhonda Brantley is a kindergarten teacher.
David Brantley is an engineer for General Dy-
namics.

But more important, Chad, Todd, Andrea and
Ryan Brantley are kids, aged 2 to 13.

And kids like horses.

Saturday, the Brantleys went home with three
mustangs they bought as part of the US. Bureau
of Land Management’s Adopt-a-Horse program.

Fifty-six horses were up for adoption Saturday
in pens at the Fort Worth Livestock Exchange
Building on the North Side. Adoption costs are
$125 a head.

By late Saturday, only 14 horses were without
new parents. Prospective parents will have an-
other chance to buy the spirited animals at 8 am.
Sunday, when the auction resumes. The mares
and foals have been sold.

“We bought the three horses for the kids to
ride,” Rhonda Brantley said. “We’ve had horses
before . . . they are more than pets. The children
will raise and tame the horses so they can learn to
ride them for leisure.”

One young horsebreeder —— l4»year—old Brad
Hudson of Fort Worth —— decided not to buy

Saturday.

“I decided to wait and buy a horse
during spring break and go down to
the ranch, get it broken and then
bring it back to Keller (where the
family will move in three months). ”

Threefourths of the people who
lined the pens Saturday were fami-
lies looking for horses for pleasure
riding, said Murray Hernandez of
the U. S. Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, which handles the program.

U. S. Bureau of Land Management
officials worry of possible mistreat-
ment of the animals and admit appli-
cants are hard to screen.

However, owners are required to
sign legal documents assuring they
will provide adequate care and
treatment.

.If the animals are later found
abused, the owners could land in
prison for one year and fined $2,000
for each instance of abuse, Hernan-
dez said.

In Cooke County last January, a

justice of the peace ordered 33 wild
horses returned to the Bureau of
Land Management after a report of
animal abuse.

The horses were among a herd of
more than 50 horses given to a C01-
linsville area man under the Wild
Horse and Burro Adoption pro
gram.

The bureau retains title to the "
horses for one year, and only four
wild horses can be adopted in one
year, said Rita Nichols, who runs the -
bureau’s Collinsville Wild Horse and
Burro Distribution Center 70 miles
north of Fort Worth. The center is
open Wednesday through Saturday
and houses 75 horses that are up for
adoption. -

At the end of the year, if the owner
wants to sell the horse he must have
a veterinarian verify the horse’s
condition before he can have title to
the horse, Nichols said.

About 10,000 horses are put up for
adoption each year

“The official and conventional wis-

and because of increased visitation into

“I’m suggesting something very dif-
ferent,” Chase said. “Today, the biggest
killer of grizzlies is management.”

To back his charge, Chase cites the
deaths of 325 grizzlies in and around
Yellowstone since 1968. He says too
many of those deaths were at the hands
of rangers — by shooting when a bear
invaded a campsite, by overtranquiliz-

In the wild, grizzly bears are victims to no animal,

but today just a

Effort to save grizzly
may have gone awry

‘ DENVER (AP) — Weighing up to 800
pounds and stretching up to 8 feet tall,
grizzly bears got more than most when
protection was handed out. In the wild,
grizzlies fear no other animal, and in
the human world their survival is
guarded by law. ‘ .

But today, as the great bears slum-
ber through the winter, debate‘ has
ﬂared anew whether a 17-year cam-
paign to save the grizzlies and increase
their numbers is working.

When the effort began in 1968, the

grizzly population was ﬂourishing in
Canadaibut had dwindled in the lower
48 states. Just a few hundred remained
of the thousands that had roamed the
American West 150 years ago.
_ Most of the survivors were clustered
in and around two Western national
parks — Glacier in northern Montana
and Yellowstone, which straddles Wyo-
ming, Montana and Idaho.

Because few other animals are as
evocative of the West as the mammoth,
silver-tipped grizzly, people became
concerned when they learned the griz-
zly was in trouble. The question now is
whether the effort to save the bears has
helped or hurt them.

In a recent issue of Outside maga-
zine, Alston Chase of Livingstone,
Mont, accused the National Park Ser-
vice of systematically destroying the
grizzlies of Yellowstone National Park
through the management program
adopted in 1968.

His 16,000 words are two chapters
from PIaying God in Yellowstone: The

' Destruction of America’s First Na-

tional Park, a book to be published in
April. ‘

Two years ago, Chase ~ former
chairman of the philosophy department
at Macalester College in Minnesota
and holder of degrees from Harvard,
Oxford and Princeton — made environ-
mental headlines with similar charges
in Atlantic Monthly.

chairman of the 2—year-old feder-
. al-state Interagency Grizzly Bear Com-
mittee, disagrees with Chase.

“We’ve reduced the mortality on the
bears.” Buterbaugh said. “I would say
they’re holding their own. At this point

in time, that’s about as optimistic as

: we can be.” ~

, The interagency committee now offi-
cially estimates 185 to 225 grizzlies
roam Yellowstone, down from 500 in
1968. Near Glacier National Park in
northern Montana, the grizzly popula-
tion’s steady growth prompted the be-
ginning of a state-sanctioned hunting
season in 1974.

Yellowstone Superintendent Bob,
Barbee was blunt in responding to‘
Chase’s charges.

“We believe (Chase) has taken some
liberties with the data," Barbee said on
a recent visit to Denver. “He does a
great deal of homework on the subject,

, but he doesn’t necessarily draw the
' right conclusions.’ '

“We’re going to have to go back and

respond to arguments we thought we

had laid to rest.”

Chase begins his January article
with a poignant story. In 1984, he
writes, Yellowstone rangers watched
for some days as a grizzly sow and
three cubs, trapped by a spring thaw on
an island in Yellowstone Lake, strug-
gled to find food. Chase recounts a Na-
tional Park Service decision to let the
“situation develop naturally.”

“That’s simply a lie,” Barbee said.
“As soon as we found out those bears

. were on that island we moved as fast

as we humanly, possibly could."

When park officials moved the ema-
ciated bears to shore, the smallest of
the cubs died.

In another passage, seeking numbers
to support his assertion the grizzly pop-
ulation had dr0pped, Chase quotes a
source as saying that Dr. Richard
Knight, 3 Park Service employee who
headed the pre-committee Grizzly
Bear Study Team. had told the source
that, in five years, he had been able to
find only 46 grizzlies.

HOUSTON POST - Feb. 2, 1986

Can black—footed ferret cheat

The endangered black-footed ferret has
already made one dramatic comeback
from apparent extinction, but can it cheat
{the grave a second time?

. An engaging little critter with a bandit-

,mask strip of black across the face, the

black-footed ferret once preyed on prairie

dogs through a dozen western states. John

James Audubon drew the first picture of
1 one in 1851.

-- But as the prairie dogs were gradually
' poisoned or trapped out as a nuisance, this
unusual species of ferrets began vanish-
ing, too.

By the mid-19608, a small colony in
South Dakota made up the only known
remaining black-footed ferrets. Those also
jvanished during the next decade, and for a
number of years it appeared the mink-like
animal was gone for good.

Then, in September 1981, came electri—
tying news for endangered species fans —
the black-footed ferret was alive and well
in Wyoming!

For years biologists had been chasing

down reported sightings of the elusive,
nocturnal. ferret across several western

states. They found no ferrets.

Now, however, a dog named Shep, liv-
ing on a ranch near Meeteetse, Wyo., not
only sighted a black-footed ferret but
killed same. So there was no problem of

verification. The ferret apparently had

Siesen trying to swipe dog food from Shep’s
' h.

Federal and state wildlife biologists
quietly infiltrated the area and jubilantly
confirmed its prairie dog towns were also
home to a sizable colony of the ferrets.

Local residents developed a proprietary
pride in the rare animals and helped the
biologists study and protect the little night
prowlers.

By the middle of 1984, scientists using
spotlights had counted 129 black-footed
ferrets in the seemingly healthy and ex-

- panding colony.

But that September brought the first
storm signals, according to a report by
Dick Randall, a field representative for
the Defenders of Wildlife organization.

The prairie dog towns which fed and
sheltered the ferrets suddenly became vir-

tual ghost towns. . Almost all the prairie

    

 

 

dogs had vanished.

An analysis of ﬂeas taken from their
burrows confirmed the suspicion of scien-
tists — the prairie dog towns were being
decimated by the deadly disease which, in
humans, is known as the bubonic plague.

With their food supply threatened, the
ferrets now began exhibiting trouble signs
of their own, Randall continued.

A spotlight count in July and August
1985 managed to locate only 58 ferrets -—-a
frightening decline from the 129 counted a
year earlier. The ferrets were thought to
be immune to the plague, and there was
no evidence they were yet starving to
death. But the sharp decline in population
was worrisome.

‘ the grave a 2nd time?

 

    

After urging from Defenders of Wildlife,

‘ the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service decided

to trap six ferrets for a captive breeding
population in case it was needed.

Last Oct. 22, Randall reports, the ferret
research team was meeting in Laramie to
review the situation when a state veteri-
narian, Dr. Tom Thorne, walked in and
dropped a bombshell.

One of the newly-captured ferrets was
dead and a second was dying. They had
canine distemper.

The incubation period for the disease
made it obvious the ferrets had been ex-
posed in the wild. Since the distemper vi-
rus can be transmitted through the air,
and since all six captive ferrets were kept
in the same room, obviously all six would
probably die.

This development sent the biologists
scurrying out to capture six more ferrets,
to be kept in isolation from each other. By
this time, however, the biologists had
trouble finding six ferrets to capture.

Although three sets of ferret tracks
(perhaps from the same ferret) were

found in November’s snows, Randall re—

‘ ports, no one knows at this point whether

there are any more ferrets left at all in the
wild. , . ..

Except for the distemper deaths among
the captives, the entire Meeteetse colony
of ferrets could have disappeared without
the researchers ever knowing the cause.

So, at the last available report, the
world’s entire known population of
healthy black-footed ferrets now totals
six. Six is considered the bare minimum
number of animals needed for a successful
breeding program, and inbreeding prob-
lems could still bring the program to
grief. ..

Closer to home, there have been warn-
ings that a sudden storm or an oil or
chemical spill from a barge wreck could
wipe out the Aransas colony of whooping
cranes, carefully nurtured for so long at
such cost.

After what has happened to the Wyo-
ming ferrets, those warnings don’t. seem
nearly so far-fetched as they. once dld.

Petite pigs are big in the lab

By RITA RUBIN
Dallas Morning News

FORT COLLINS, Colo. — It
‘started with a (SS-pound pig named
Martha.

Martha was smart. She could
open laboratory doors with her
snout.

Martha was clean. She didn’t
have any hair to harbor odors.

Most important, Martha was
small.

From 1978 until her death last
summer at age 10, Martha had be-
come matriarch of a dynasty of
micropigs. Their size and similarity
to humans make Martha’s great-
great-great grandchildren valuable
as research animals. '

“It’s a lot easier to pick up a pig
that weighs 50 pounds than one that
weighs 200,” says Linda Panepinto,
the Colorado State University swine
specialist who played matchmaker

. between Martha and a small boar of
the same breed.
,« Pigs have been gaining populari-

ty as research animals, because of
their human-like teeth, skin, metab-
olism and cardiovascular systems.
“The configuration of their coronary
arteries is almost identical to hu-
mans’,” says Panepinto, director of
Colorado State’s miniature swine
laboratory. Like humans, pigs can
develop heart disease, ulcers, arthri-
tis and diabetes. .

AT 600 to 800 pounds, common
farm pigs are too unwieldy to use as
‘research animals. Breeders have
tried to miniaturize pigs by crossing
small farm pigs with even smaller
wild pigs, but they sometimes end up
with rather large, ill-tempered ani-
mals.

Martha was a Yucatan miniature
wine whose ancestors were first
orought from Mexico to the United
States 25 years ago. Colorado State
. researchers began developing ways
to use the Yucatan miniature swine
as a research animal in 1973.

.“The Yucatan is the only
miniature (pig) breed in North
America that has been main-
tained as a pure strain,” Pane-
pinto says. “I think they had the

And Martha’s potential ap-
peared to be the greatest of the
greatest. “I had the feeling she
was truly genetically small,”
Panepinto Says. “It was just an
idea we had that we should try to
select for smaller size.”

Panepinto based. rher- hunch
about Martha’s genes on the fact
that Martha was a normal-sized
piglet. Full-grown, though, Mar-
tha weighed only about a third of
the Yucatan miniature swine’s
normal 150 to 200'pounds.

Panepinto’s hunch proved
correct. Martha’s progeny,
christened Yucatan micropigs,
were even smaller than their
mother. Fourth-generation mi-
cropi gs weigh an average of only
50 to 70 pounds at maturity,
with a top weight of 100 pounds.
They are only slightly larger
than beagles, a widely used re-
search animal.

And micropigs are money
savers, says Dr. David Secord,
professor of experimental sur-
gery and director of animal re-
search at the University of Al-
berta in Edmonton.

Micropigs cost only $150 to
$200 each, compared to $500 to
$600 for a purebred dog. Because
millions of pigs are raised for
commercial purposes, cages and
food are readily and cheaply
available. Micropigs eat only a
pound of food a day, compared to
five pounds for farm pigs.

To hear Secord, the Yucatan
pigs are perfect research ani-
mals. The University of Alberta
was the first Canadian research

 

center. to use Yucatan miniature
swine and their descendants, the
micropigs. Eventually, Secord
says, the university will replace
nearly all its research animals
with micropigs from Colorado
State.

“The miniature pig is so doc-

,. ile, SO small, it’s easy to handle,”

‘Secord says. “. . .Jhe potential

of these new miniature pigs has
Just barely been looked at.”

{ALBERTA SCIENTISTS are
taking advantage of the pigs’

Plastic surgery researchers
are using the pigs to try to
develop techniques to stretch
skin grafts for burn patients.
The researchers are trying to
expand the pigs’ skin by placing
an inflatable cuff underneath it,
Secord says.

Pharmacologists are using
the pigs to study how foods
affect absorption of oral medica-
tions. To do so, they must insert
small tubes to withdraw blood
through the pigs’ backs and into

i their liver and other organs.
‘ Dogs chew on such tubes, and

primates pull them out, Secord
says. But the pigs will leave the
tubes alone for two weeks at a.

time, enabling researchers to .

complete their work.

PANEPINTO HAS developed
a tool that enables researchers to
perform such tests with greater
case, not to mention greater
comfort for the pig.

In many research laborato-
ries, pigs are hog-tied or re-
.strained'by several people when
undergoing tests, Panepinto
says. This can increase a pig’s
anxiety and alter study results,
she says.

 

Panepinto has patented a
sheepskin-lined sling to hold
miniature pigs and micrOpigs
while researchers draw blood,
measure their blood pressure or
perform other tests. The pigs lie
belly down with their legs stick-
ing through holes in the Pane-
pinto Sling. A boat winch is used

2: to hoist pig and sling off the
, floor.

The slings are so comfortable

’ that the pigs have been known to
’ doze while undergoing tests,

which can take up to six hours,
Panepinto says.

“Animal comfort is one of my
biggest priorities,” Panepinto
says. It’s more humane, and
“you get better science if the
animal niecebgs comfortable.” ,

A’cat fight': Elderly battle project landlords
fo r rig ht to l<e e p p e ts

UPI photo

Jacob Sidney Grill, 73, wanted a cat to keep him company in
his federally subsidized apartment, but the landlords said no.

 

In 1984, HUD notified tenants
and landlords in the nation’s 12,000
HUDsubsidized apartment build-
ings that they were proposing

' rules that allowed apartment pets.

Within months they received more
than 4,800 letters, most from rent—
ers eager to have cats and dogs.

“We had more comments on
this rule than any other in the last
three or four years,” said one
HUD attorney. “The response was
enormous.”

A final rule allowing a limited
number of pets per unit has been
submitted to the federal Office of
Management and Budget for ap-
proval.

HUD won’t specify how many

" pets per apartment are recom-

mended in the rule, but the rule

3 does state that most landlords in
' HUD-subsidized units may not re-

quire pet owners to pay more than

, $300 in security deposits.

HUD officials expect to have a
final decision from the OMB early
this year, although they do not
know whether their recommenda-
tions will emerge without major
revisions. . .

In the meantime, Grill says he

 

Septuagenarian says senior citizens living in federally subsidized housing
should be allowed to have pets for companionship in their golden years

By NIKI CERVANTES

 

OS ANGELES (UPI) — J a-
cob Sidney Grill, 73, has for
five long years been wag-

ing a quiet battle with the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment that may soon benefit
millions of senior citizens nation-
wide.

Is he after money? Power? No.
All he wants is a cat.

“I live alone now. I’m lonesome.
I talk to ,my plants,” he says, “but
they can’t talk'back. At least a cat
meows.”

Grill has even picked out the pet
he wants — a gray-and-white Per-
sian named Gigi. It belongs to a
friend “and she’s just waiting for
me to pick Gigi up.”

Grill had no idea how hard that
would be, however, when he
moved into an apartment building
not far from downtown Los Ange-
les in 1981. The neighborhood
wasn’t particularly safe and his
building wasn’t great.

But it was subsidized by HUD,
which meant he paid less than $100
a month in rent — necessary be-

 

cause the former Las Vegas adver-
tising salesman’s Social Security
and other income were less than
$500 a month.

It was pretty lonely, but when
Grill decided to get a pet, his
building’s owners refused, he says.
HUD was little help. It left deci-
sions such as whether tenants are
allowed to have pets up to the own—
ers of the units.

Grill would not give up.

“I knew what a beneficial im-
pact it would have on me and on
other elderly people to have a
pet,” he says. “It does great
things for their well being.

“So I kept chasing them and
chasing them, on and on,” he said.

Apparently he was not alone.
After years of being hounded by el-
derly pet lovers living in HUD I
units, Congress in 1983 approved a
statute giving HUD authorization

H to decide the pet issue.

I and other seniors are still battling

their landlords for the right to
keep pets, even though HUD has
said pets should be allowed pend-
ing final word from the OMB. .
“Most seniors don’t realize they
‘ can have pets while they’re wait-
, ing” for the OMB decision, Grill
3 complained. I
; He said his landlord has agree
, to allow him to have Gigi, but only
if he puts up a $1,000 security de-
' posit. .
' Even HUD officials, who hear
frequently from unhappy land-
lords about the pet rule, were
shocked by the amount.

Officials from the company
managing Grill’s building, Encino-
based American Diversified, said
Grill misunderstood the amount of
deposit they are requiring, saying
they are asking only another $100
for the pet. , '

Grill points out that he has al-
ready paid a $106 security deposit.
“How much damage beyond $106
can a cat do?”

Beer—loving goat
,avored to win
ajitas election

«Post Reporters

 

LAJITAS —- Even though Clay
Henry is a renowned alcoholic,
he’s the odds-on favorite to upset
Mayor Tommy Steele in April’s
election in this desolate West Tex-
as town. That Clay Henry is a goat
is only incidental.

After all, Steele (who lives most
of the year in Tomball anyway)
replaced Buster the Blue Tick
Hound as mayor when Buster
passed away two years ago.

'When the locals
say it’s only fitting
that Clay Henry -—
Lajitas’ most fam-
ous resident — be
mayor, it’s usually
after they’ve just
shared a six pack
{with the goat who
makes his home in
a pen outside the
Lajitas Trading
Post. Sometimes
“the pile of beer
icans and bottles lit-
tering the pen is so
thick you can’t see
the dirt.

“‘He’s a beer-
drinking goat,”

said Steele. “He
does a very good
job of it.”
Steele, 69, runs a

glazed look in his eyes.”

The trading post -- just a hop,
skip, and a stumble from the
famed Comanche Ford of the Rio
Grande -— once served Pancho Vil-

’ la just after the turn of the centu-
ry. In addition to serving many of
Villa’s kin today, the small store
also serves the few year-round res-
idents who make this resort area
their home, and the thousands of
tourists who stop by just to take a

look at Clay Henry.

“It’s not uncommon now for a
tour bus to stop in front of the pen,
everybody get out and have the

'. guide talk about
Clay Henry while
all these little
whitehaired peo-
ple take pictures,”

Ivey said.

PICK-UP BUSINESS—Steven Dannenberg’s business, Canine Waste

1

Removal, provides homeowners with an easy, inexpensive method of
waste disposal that “picks up where your dog left off. ”

 

Man’s Best Friend’s Best
Friend’s Business Picks Up

fter reading about a Denver

man who started his own
business removing canine waste
from people’s yards, Omaha,
Nebraska, resident Steve
Dannenberg thought that sounded
like a pretty good business to try in
his neck of the woods. “I’ve
always wanted to start my own
business,” Dannenberg reports,
“so I went up to Denver and saw
this guy.” Upon returning to
Omaha, Steve decided to give
canine waste removal a try, and his
company of the same name was
born.

Dannenberg charges his
customers 353 per week per dog to
drive up in his brilliant yellow
pick-up truck and scoop up the
offending matter for removal.

 

Using flyers, referrals from pet
shops and vets, and word—of-
mouth, Steve has built his business
into a client list of over 120. Start-
up required less than $1,000,
since Steve already had a pick-up,
and business is going swimmingly.

Dannenberg reports (with no
trace of humor in his voice) that
this is a dirty job, but somebody
has to do it. For those
entrepreneurs looking for a very
low-start-up business that doesn’t
require any special knowledge or
training, this is a great idea. And it
can work Virtually anywhere.

board ’

quury river cruise for cats and dogs, but owners can come along,

By JULIE VORMAN

. _ m ,

ALLAS (Renter) — Passengers aboard
a special Mississippi River luxury
cruise this spring can enjoy a glitter-
ing masquerade ball. attend sunrise church
services on the deck and have their coats
brushed, bathed and de-fleaed.

Thevpassengers will be dogs and cats, none
weighing more than 25 pounds and purebreds
preferred, thank you. Humans will be allowed
to accompany the four—legged travelers and
pick up the $1,000 tab.

i Dallas travel agent Ed Lang is planning
what he says is the first ever pet cruise to cater
to Texas pet owners who have long growled
about cruise line regulations prohibiting ani-
mal passengers. Only the Queen Elizabeth II
permits pets but requires the animals to be
locked in cages in the hold.

:eramped, smelly cage in a windowless
roem is not what his pampered dog and cat cli-
ents are accustomed to, Lang said.

;;f‘fi’hc types of pets we’re talking about are
the kind that sleep with their owners in multi-
million-dollar homes. These pets are probably
cleaner than most people." said Lang, who
works at American International Travel in an
exclusive Dallas neighborhood.

The springtime cruise from New Orleans to
the historic city of Vicksburg, Miss, will Be a
first-class vacation for dogs and cats raised in
the lap of luxury.

Most events on board will be designed for hu—
mans and animals though the emphasis is on
the pets.

A fancy dress masquerade ball, standard
fare on cruises for human. vacationers, is
planned for pets only, with the owners permit-
ted as escorts only. Prizes will be awarded for
the best costumes.

“One lady told me she has a costume for her
poodle that makes the dog look just like (sing-
er) Dolly Par-ton.” Lang said. “Some pet own-
ers have tuxedoes and tails for their dogs.”

On Easter Sunday, the second day of the
cruise, pets and their owners will be able to at-
tend a sunrise church service on board the
ship. A Roman Catholic priest has agreed to
bless all the four~legged worshippers.

Animal passengers traveling on the MB
New Orleans cruise ship will also have their
ewr “poopdeck” for that purpose.

. “in the Open area of one of the decks, we’ll
put down some sod and potted plants to make

 

0 4'”.

the pets feel at home,” Lang explained. The 2- .

year-old luxury ship owned by American
Cruise Lines will dock frequently during the
voyage to accommodate passengers preferring
fire hydrants and trees.

Dogs and cats must be accompanied on the
Mississippi River cruise by a human guardian,
with costs calculated at about $1,000 per per-
son / pet couple. The luxury ship can accommo.
date up to 125 human passengers and 60 four-
legged ones.

Lang said he had just started advertising for
the cruise so it was not clear how many vaca-
tioners would actually sign up.

Owners are encouraged to bring their pets’
favorite foods, although the ship’s kitchen staff
will be on call to meet any special dietary
needs.

To satisfy the whims and whimpers of its

wealthy passengers, the ship will also be
staffed with a veterinarian, animal groomer,
dog obedience expert and pet photographer.

“We’ll even provide little life preservers for
each of the pets to protect them while strolling
on the deck,” Lang said.

The cruise will sail north from New Orleans
on March 29, stopping at historic plantations,
museums and antebellum homes along the
banks of the Mississippi River.

With modern logging practices,

who was preparing to go in on
cross-country skis to take some pic-
tures of the moose. (“There were
about 30 beds in the snow.”

“We don’t like to have too many

away in a grove of aspens. “It must

. ~=The moose, once prominent in
. the - cold wilderness across the
, Northern United States, has held its
' own in Alaska, Washington, Idaho,
, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Min-
- nesota. But it had virtually van-
. ished from the Northeast by the
' late 18005 as the forests were
; cleared for lumber mills, farms and
. towns. The last native New York
state moose was shot in 1861 near
_ Racquette Lake in the Adiron-

dacks.

. iIn recent years, however, the
species has made a remarkable
, comeback - especially in Maine,
." where its numbers have rebounded
over the last 50 years from about

2,000 in 1935 to an estimated 20,000
today. That makes Maine No. 1 for
moose in the country, outside of
Alaska, said Karen Morris of
Maine’s Inland Fisheries and Wild-
life Department.

It was within the last five years
that the moose returned to upstate
New York.

Some states have begun active
programs to bolster their moose
population. Michigan airlifted 29
moose from Canada by helicopter
last year. In New York, there have
been some relocation projects, pub—
lic and private, in the past, but all
failed. The largest was a 1902 effort
championed by William Rockefel-
ler, former Presidents Benjamin
Harrison and Grover Cleveland and
other prominent citizens who got
the state to release 12 or 15 moose in
the Adirondacks at a cost to the
taxpayers of about $5,000.

Now, “they’re just walking in on
their own,” said Hicks, an endan-
gered-species specialist for the New
York state Department of Environ-
mental Conservation.

“Between 1935 and 1980, 22
moose wandered into the state.
Five were shot, a couple left the
state, the rest just disappeared.
Then, since 1980, they started com-
ing in in significant numbers —
primarily because of expanding
numbers in Maine, Vermont and
New Hampshire where there’s
been. a tenfold increase since the
19705. Some have come in from Can-

ada —- one walked right through

Customs, past all the cars,” Hicks
said. _

In 1980, one man shot a moose in
his back yard in Clinton County a
few days after it came across the
border. Another caused a sensation
in the city of Glens Falls.

“It was standing there in the
middle of a cemetery surrounded
by 400 rampaging Glens Fallsians,”
Hicks said. “Someone was going to
be killed, and it wasn’t going to be
the moose.” Biologists shot it with a
tranquilizer dart and tried to move
it, but the animal died.

The number of moose increased
steadily after 1980, with five ani-
mals reported in 1981; seven to 10,

including the first calf, in 1982, and

, 15 to 23 in 1983, including one that
i got as far south as the Rip Van

Winkle Bridge, 110 miles north of
Manhattan.

Now there are an estimated 30
moose wandering around the Adi-
rondacks and they are believed to
be reproducing, Hicks said.

Moose No.1 is the first moose
equipped with a radio collar in New
York as biologists watch the grow
ing population with increasing in-

terest. Hicks and other DEC work-

ers captured him in October in the
city of Watertown, where they
feared he would have a fatal en-
counter with a truck, a gun or a
plate-glass window.

The beast was tranquilized and

, trucked to a more moose-worthy

part of the Adirondacks. Over the
next couple of months, he wan-
dered about 200 miles, said Hicks,
who keeps track of the animal’s zig-
zag travels on a map.

A second moose, a half-ton bull
dubbed Moose No.2, was equipped

. with a radio collar in October when,

Hicks and company removed him

from a farmer’s field where the
amorous animal was keeping guard
over a harem of Holsteins. State
biologist Ted Smith said the farm
was besieged by an adoring public,

‘ some of whom were treed or nearly

trampled when they got too close.

The radio collars allow biologists
not only to track the animals’ wan-
derings, but also to periodically
check them for signs of brain
worm, a parasite believed to be the
main threat to a moose’s survival.

“Some people are skeptical that
the moose can survive in New York
because of the brain worm,” Hicks
said. The parasite also infests
white-tailed deer, but isn’t fatal to
that species like it is to the moose,
Where whitetailed deer flourish —'
as in New York, where there are an
estimated 600,000 —— moose usually
are scarce, he said.

Morris, who conducts a winter
moose census in Maine from a small
plane, said the species declined
therein the late 18005 when milder
winters and .a lot of abandoned
farmland helped deer populations
to grow, and hence brain worm to

LOS ANGELES TIMES MAGAZINE — March 2, 1986

was sitting with my hus-
band, Robert Trages-
ser—a 6-foot, 4-inch logi-
cian—in a waiting room on
Ventura Boulevard in Sher-
man Oaks. With us were
Max MacElroy DVM,his as-
sistant Lynne Perry and
Cinder, a 6-month-old
leopard who was leaping
for Robert’s back. Robert
was trying—and failing——
to figure out what was hap-
pening to him. (Exactly
how logicians end up in
such enviable situations is
a trade secret.)

I knew what was happen-
ing to him: Cinder is, like
any kitty cat, intensely in-
terested in people, and es-
pecially interested in figur-
ing out which person in a
room is the most interest-
ing one to unsettle. Robert
qualified because he’s tall
(leopards love trees and
are alert to height). It was

also the first time he had
found himself in the pres-
ence of a young, energetic
and intelligent leopard, so
he was sending out incon-
gruent signals that made
Cinder curious. You know
about cats and curiosity.
The old saying has it
wrong, though. It is usually
the mouse that is killed by

Too Much Leopard

BY VICKI HEARNE

 

the cat’s curiosity, not the
cat, and even if a mouse is a
logician, satisfaction of the
cat’s curiosity doesn’t bring
the victim back.

Robert wasn’t killed, but
he did lose his heart to Cin-
der. This sort of thing hap-
pens with leopards, which
is how MacElroy came to
have big cats. The first one
he had was Rocky, a lion,
brought to him about 25

years ago at the age of 8
weeks with virtually every
bone in his body broken.
These were fractures
caused by rickets. There

was a bobcat with a similar
story. Cinder’s mother had
such a story. MacElroy fixes
them up instead of putting
them down, and that’s how
they become his pets.
It’s because Cinder is
properly handled that she
didn’t eat up Robert. An
enormous amount of atten-
tiveness is required in or-
der to end up wit-h a men-
tally and physically healthy
and safe leopard in captivi-
ty. MacElroy and Perry have
the rare capacity for this at-
tentiveness.

Leopards, according to

Bob Wagner at the Ameri-
can Assn. of Zoological
Parks and Aquariums in
Wheeling, W.Va., are
thought of as the most cun-
ning of the big cats. They
are unlike lions, for exam-
ple, in that they spend a lot
of time in trees, and can
even carry their kills—up
to 45 pounds, about half
their own size—~into tree-
tops and consume their
dinners in the branches.
Cunning, of course, is the
sort of term you use if you
are a zookeeper worried

Fort Cronkite: Where Marine
Mammals Recuperate in Marin

 

0 one was expecting the pup to be

born. Not Laurie Gage, the veterinar—

ian; not Debbie Vandenbroek, the di-

rector of animal care; and none of the
200 volunteers. In fact, the only one who
knew that things were about to change
around the California Marine Mammal
Center at Fort Cronkite was the pup’s
mother, Arseno. Her father, Chariot, may
have sensed something, but it still must have
caught him by surprise. After all, California
sea lions are born only in summer, aren’t
they?

Apparently not. On December 5, 1985,
in one of the cages at the Marine Mammal
Center, Arseno, a blind California sea lion,

' gave birth to her pup, Belfast. Unfortunate-
ly, Chariot couldn’t watch the delivery: He’s
blind, too. But a group of human beings was
on hand to witness the birth; a visitor report-
ed to a staff member that something was,
well, ﬁshy in one of the cages, and Belfast
was born before an audience of school chil-
dren and center volunteers and staff mem-
bers. And all were amazed. You see, not on-
ly do the books and scientists say that sea
lions are rarely born later than September,
but Vandenbroek had just recently com-

 

 

mented to one of the volunteers how slender
and healthy Arseno was looking.

The California Marine Mammal Center
is a private, non—proﬁt organization dedicat-
ed to rescuing and rehabilitating injured and
ailing marine mammals—primarily seals
and sea lions, but occasionally whales and
dolphins as well. Most of the animals have
been stricken by natural maladies, notably
pneumonia, stomach ulcers and an as yet
unnamed skin disease. In the last two years,
leptospirosis, an epidemic bacterial disease
of the kidney and liver, has also accounted
for a large number of sick sea lions.

The center, which hosts approximately
40,000 visitors a year, was ﬁrst incorporated
in 1975. Since that time it has treated and
released hundreds of stranded animals. In
1984, the center admitted 296 patients; last
year, there were 94. The number varies
widely, but there are usually no more than
30 to 35 recuperating at any one time.

It usually begins with a phone call. An
animal has been spotted washed up on a
beach somewhere between San Luis Obispo
and the Oregon border (the rescue area
boundaries). A trained crew is dispatched to
the site, the animal is picked up, brought to
the center and diagnosed, and treatment is
begun as quickly as possible. (Note: Center
staffers implore you not to go near animals
you come across. First, they can be danger-

 

 

 

ous; second, mothers often leave their young
on'the beach temporarily to go ﬁshing—and
a pup touched by human hands may be
abandoned for good by its mother.)

Often the recent arrivals are so sick they
can’t eat the Atlantic herring the volunteers
feed them, and in such cases the ﬁsh must
be mashed and the animal tube-fed. Soon,
though, the seal or sea lion gets used to be-
ing fed and will eat the ﬁsh whole, although
at ﬁrst the dead ﬁsh are often viewed some-
what skeptically by the patients.

Most of the inﬁrm are well enough to re-
turn to the water after three to six months,
either on the beaches at the Marin head-
lands or up the coast at Point Reyes. It’s
while they’re convalescing that visitors can
get good views of them. Although some
lounge lethargically, seemingly unaware
they’re in the spotlight, others seize the op-
portunity to perform: clapping their rubbery
ﬂippers or slapping them against the water,
barking and belching and being rather audi-
bly offensive in general. You realize these
guys don’t need to be trained to be cut-ups.

The California Marine Mammal Center
is open to the public from 10 am. to 4 pm.
every day of the year. The center welcomes

groups of all ages, and its Education Pro-
gram introduces school children to the basic

balance. Groups are advised to call ahead to
ensure a guided tour. Admission to the cen-
ter is free, although if you’re so inspired, you
can make a tax-deductible donation or be-

by grants, donations and membership dues).

What about Belfast? As soon as she’s old
enough and strong enough to travel—most
likely late this month—she’ll be heading,
with mom and dad, to a zoo in Belfast, Ire—

Hooston Zoo plans $57,600 study of rhinos' sex lives

HOUSTON POST - March 4, 1986

Wants Council 0K

to seek federal grant

By MARK 01mm
Post Reporter

Until now, it has been Sam-
buru’s secret.

But the keepers of the 18-year-
old Southern white rhinoceros
want to tell all the world that Sam-
buru hasn’t been able to impreg-
nate his mate, Marsabit — despite
15 years of opportunities.

Houston Zoo officials have gone
public with that tidbit in the form
of a proposal for a $25,000 federal
grant. The zoo wants the City
Council to approve the grant appli-
cation today to help pay for a

 

The study, which will concen-
trate on Samburu and Marsabit,
will be aimed at developing an ar—
tificial insemination method for
rhinos and establishing Houston as
a central stud farm for the rare
beasts.

While Samburu’s predicament
is at issue, zoo veterinarian Terry
Blasdel hopes the study helps oth-
er rhinos with similar problems.

“Our goal is conservation,” said
Blasdel, a reproductive physiolo-
gist and zoo research curator.

Houston’s white rhinos, one of
25 pairs in captivity, have been at
the 200 since 1971, five years after

they were captured in Africa,
Blasdel said. Despite a number of
encouragements, zookeepers
haven’t been able to consummate
the marriage.

“They’re not quite as bad as
pandas, because they will repro-
duce when they’re in groups,”
Blasdel said.

One problem, according to zoo
gossip, is the two animals’ relative
sizes.

“She’s larger than he is,” Blas-
del said. “We think she intimi-
dates him.”

One of Blasdel’s chores Monday
was the collection of Marsabit’s
and Samburu’s feces and urine —
in the interest of romance, of
course. Houston trades the stuff
with other zoos, freezing it until
zookeepers visit their counter-

parts.

Since rhino impotence can be
blamed on keeping, the animals in
pairs instead of herds, zookeepers
try to trick the rhinoceroses into
thinking they’re in a herd by
spreading other rhinos’ wastes,
Blasdel said. The herd instinct
helps males who need “the stimu-
lation of two or three females,”
the rhino vet said.

“I’ve spread it before and it had

' rather dramatic effects,” Blasdel

said, referring to Samburu’s at-
tempted — but not completed ——
advances.

According to documents sent to
the City Council, the zoo hopes to
snare the $25,000 grant from the
Institute of Museum Services and
supplement it with another $32,600
in private donations. Whatever is
learned of white rhinos’ reproduc-
tive habits and artificial insemina-

tion possibilities will be applicable
to other, equally endangered rhino
species, Blasdel said.

The issue isn’t just academic .—
for Marsabit and Samburu, or is:
any rhinoceroses.

Rhinos can live to age 50, but
the oldest known pregnant rhino
was 23 and the rule of thumb is
that rhinos normally reproduce-
until they reach age 20, Blasdel.
said.

According to a rhino “stud
book,” more than half the captiw
population is 10 to 20 years old
now, which means their biological
clocks are ticking. And the study,
if it is approved today by the City
Council and blessed with the feder—
al grant, could take up to two
years.

“We’re dealing with an aging
population,” she said. “Time is
running out.”

Metrozoo Goes Deener Into African Plains

Miami Metrozoo is celebrating its ﬁfth year
with the debut Of three new African exhibits,
expansion of the Free-F lying Bird Show and
opening of the Zoofari Monorail’s ﬁnal station.

The zoo is a progressive, cageless setting
where animals roam free on islands surround-
ed by moats in environments that closely
resemble their native habitats. Opened in 1981,
Metrozoo has expanded 15 acres for a total of
280 developed acres.

The African elephant exhibit is the ﬁrst new
display along the expanded African loop.
Previously exhibited with the 200’s Asian
elephants, three African elephants will have a

The 200’s new walkway extends beyond the

 

rhino exhibit to the fourth and ﬁnal Zoofari
Monorail Station. Zoo visitors now have the op-
tion of getting on and off the monorail in this
just—completed area.

The $13 million monorail system provides
visitors with a bird’s-eye View of the zoo in cool,
airconditioned comfort. Trained drivers narrate
the ride, with information on the 200’s design,
its history and exotic species, and facts about
the animals.-

Following the same path as the 200’s
walkways, the elevated trains afford views of
the entire park, especially the back areas and
animal holding pens camouﬂaged from view on
the ground. From the air, one can see how the
whole park works. .

Opened in 1981, Metrozoo has been rated as
one of the top 10 zoos in the country and one
of the larger zoos in the world. More than
793,000 visitors were recorded last year.

Said Bob Yokel, Metrozoo director, “Growth
and change will continue to characterize
Metrozoo’s future, further increasing its poten-
tial as a tourist magnet, a leader in conserva-
tion programs and as a strong community
resource.”

There are other new features at Metrozoo:

Close-Hos and Hands-0n

 

Docents from the Zoological Society of
Florida assist visitors with “Zoo Close-Ups,”
a program which allows zoo—goers to see and
touch small animals. Ferrets, snakes,
hedgehogs and a monkey are available for close—
up viewing and touch.

Zoo ofﬁcials are hopeful that such hands-on
experience will give visitors a deeper
understanding and appreciation of the exotic
animals they observe at the zoo. The close-ups
program takes place Thursday through Sunday
from noon to 3 pm.

European brown bears.

Bird Show Expands

An emu named Sydney and a soaring black
vulture are the new additions to Metrozoo’s
Free—Flying Bird Show. The show is produced
by trainer Ray Berwick, whose credits include
the animal effects for “Bird Man of Alcatraz”
and Alfred Hitchcock’s “The Birds.”

The popular show has expanded its routines:
the dramatic opening has a ﬂock of white
pigeons swooping and circling around the am-
phitheater stage. Talking parrots imitate
everything from crying babies to squealing pigs,
and Sly Sylvester, a green-winged macaw, adds' .'
his wit to the repartee.

The show demonstrates the natural abilities
and beauty of each bird'featured. The show is
presented at 12 noon, 2 and 4:30 pm. on
weekdays; at 11 am, 1, 3 and 4:30 pm. on
holidays and peak season.

Metrozoo is open every day of the year from
10 am. to 5:30 pm. with ticket booths clos-
ing at 4 pm. Admission is $5 for adults, $2.50
for children 12 and under and free for children
under two.Group rates are discounted from 15
to 20 percent. Contact: (305) 251-0401.

 




TAMPA TRIBUNE - Feb. 27, 1986

Cost of renovating
Lowry Park 200 "
up to $20 million

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune "Staff Writer

The renovation of Tampa’s
Lowry Park Zoo got a new price tag
of $20 million Wednesday and an ini-
tial $3.4 million boost from support-
ers as a fund-raising drive to finance
the project began.

Also unveiled were a 13-member
blue ribbon cabinet to guide the
money search, a new zoo emblem
featuring three egrets, and a cam-
paign theme of “Bringing Down The
Bars,” relating to the cages that are
slated to become extinct with the
new zoo.

Since an- initial design was pre-
pared for the new zoo in 1984, the
renovation price has jumped from
$10 million to $14.3 million to the
new $20 million goal. Zoo backers
expressed determination Wednes-
day to raise the $20 million and
more.

TIMES - February 19, 1986

 

 

 

By MAUREEN DOWD

Bisser, the Soviet snow leopard, is willing to
chuffle. But, unfazed by the spirit of the Geneva
summit, that is about all.

The mammal keepers at the Bronx Zoo have
been trying to mate Bisser, a male they received
last summer from the Moscow Zoo, with two
Bronx Zoo females.

But Bisser is having none of it. He occasion-
ally chuffles -— the word keepers use to describe
the loud, breathy purr that signals desire in
snow leopards --- at Olga and Hoth, who are tak-
ing turns trying to seduce him at the Carnivore
House. But when the female felines chuffle back
and try to rub up against him, Bisser runs away ,

ut the face in
the proper crouch position.
In a mating session yesterday morning, Olga,

.an experienced cat with two litters to her credit,

left Bisser completely cold. He did not even get
down from his high perch. Hoth, the younger and
more aggressive female, climbed up to his perch
and was met with a threatening growl.

‘He Could Be a Dud’

“He could be inexperienced,” a keeper,
Laurie Thomas, said, watching the mating
dance. “Or he could be a dud.”

The striking gray snow leopards are solitary
animals that roam the Himalayas and else-
where in Tibet and Nepal and pair off only to

mate. But, when they do go into heat — in Febru-
ary -— they are normally extremely eager, espe-
cially the males. ,

“It’s the first time I’ve ever seen a problem
with a male snow leopard,” said Mrs. Thomas. ‘

Although the keepers have been making jokes
behind the recalcitrant Bisser’s back about his
Communist connections, they do not want to
give up, because, as Mrs. Thomas put it, “we
really want his genes in our population.”

So they keep up his strength with the cattle
“knuckle bones” that snow leopards like to
munch on, and they consider the possiblity of
using mood enhancers. “Maybe a little cande-
light and caviar would do it,” a curator, James
Doherty, mused. “Who knows?”

For Those Who Think They Have Everything

The Whale Center in Oakland sug-
gests you combine “large” with “lar-
gess” and adopt a gray whale. For 50
tax-deductible dollars a year (and you
don’t have to buy it a Cabbage Patch
doll), you can adopt one of the
17,000-plus leviathans that cruise Cal-
ifornia’s coastal waters. You’ll receive
an adoption certificate listing you as
the adoptive parent, the name you
choose for your new offspring and its

biographical information, including
ID number, age and sex (lest you scar
the poor thing for life with the wrong
gender-engendering name), and
where and when it was last seen.
You’ll also get an official photo of
your little big one, although it’s likely
to be a paparazzi-type grab shot of
ﬂanks or flukes, since these babies
are a shy lot. It’s 10 o’clock—do you
know where yourcetacean is?

Dear Sir:

A mailing I have just received from the International Fund for Animal
welfare is most upsetting and sickening to me.

Of course, I realize yours is a very different culture from ours in
America - but, and it is a big but - for centuries most nations have
made a pet of the dog - not an article of food.

To have received a folder showing a beautiful young dog being cuddled
by a South Korean child, taken to a picnic, and then hung slowly and
butchered to eat is really barbaric as far as I am concerned, and

something which certainly does not belong 1n a modern, progressive
world.

Most nations have found the dog not only to be a perfect companion for
all ages, but a lifesaver, a guide for the blind, a hearing aid for

the deaf, a helper to the law in sniffing out drugs, and helping cap-
ture felons. The list could go on and on I am sure, so it is difficult
to believe the the people in South Korea are still eating dogs.

Enclosed are a number of stories showing how we in America look upon
this favorite friend and companion.

It is my sincere hope that South Korea will take steps to join other
countries who look upon the dog with love and compassion, and not as
an article of food.

Thank you.

THIS IS IN ANSWER TO
My LETTER OF 11/1/85 KOREAN INFORMATION OFFICE

February 28, 1986

Dear Sir/Madam:

We have received your communication concerning the treatment of dogs
and cats in Korea.

It appears highly likely that much of the information upon which your
views are based is incomplete. Since June of 1984, the Korean Government has
banned the sale of dog meat and closed those restaurants serving dog meat
to their customers. This was done on both sanitary and humanitarian grounds
and strikes at the very heart of the problem.

The Ministries of Interior and Health have launched an educational
campaign designed to eradicate those practices which you ——- and the vast
majority of the Korean people ——— find offensive.

These campaigns are being furthered by Korea's Saemaul Undong or "New
Village" movement which means that the campaigns will reach into the most
remote areas of the country through the efforts of vigorous and dedicated
village workers.

 

You should know that Koreans have never made a practice of consuming
cat meat. There is an old belief among the people that a benevolent spirit
resides within cats. Therefore, to harm a cat would be to harm the spirit.
Cats are kept by many households and restaurants in Korea to keep rodents
under control and are, therefore, highly valued.

Koreans are also keeping dogs as pets or for security reasons. Thus the
vast majority of Koreans find the practice of dog slaughter and consumption

highly abhorrent.

I hope this has helped answer your questions about this matter.

In contrast, Romanes said that dogs had
the ability both to tell and appreciate a
good joke. As one bit of evidence he dis-
cussed his own terrier, which “used, when
in good humour, to perform several tricks,
which I know to have been self-taught, and
which clearly had the object of exciting
laughter. 'For instance, while lying on his
side and violently grinning, he would hold
one leg in his mouth.” So much for the in-
: telligence of dogs. But I never said they
' were smart. And as jokes go, this isn’t a
bad one. Surely you’ve seen more than
; one comedian who would have been
; more amusing if he had put his leg in his
mouth and grinned.

: The usual criticism of Romanes is

i that he was guilty of anthropomor-

} phism. But as far as I’m concerned, ani-

, mals are like people, and I believe sci-

’ ence is coming around to this point of
view. Consider the talking apes, the

5 chimpanzees Washoe, Lana, and Nim, .
and the gorilla Koko. Not only does

1 Koko have language, or something like

é it, but she also had a pet—a pet kitten.

If having a pet doesn’t make you like a
human being, I don’t know what does.

i (Too bad it was a kitten.) Furthermore,

3 Donald Grifﬁn at Rockefeller University
; has made persuasive arguments for ani-
. mals having consciousness, at least when
; they’re awake. And at the extreme left
on the anthropomorphism issue, the ani-
mal rights movement claims for animals
the same rights that human beings enjoy.
1 The message of this movement is not that
animals are like people but that they are
‘ people.

f This new, and welcome, anthropomor-
g phism doesn’tquite prove Romanes’s ar-
gument, however, and I did promise proof.
For that we need sociobiology. If you re-
call, sociobiology is the scientiﬁc disci-
pline in which you pick a behavior, like be-
ing rich, and construct a good story of how
it evolved to show that it’s genetic, and not
the result of trust funds. (Critics some-
times claim that sociobiologists miss the

; subtle distinction between “inheritance” .

and “heredity.”) If I tried this approach
with my argument, I’d be in trouble. I can’t
? start with my conclusion—dog humor—
and then construct a story. That would be
, begging the question. So I’ll start with the
' story. If it’s good enough, I’m sure we’ll

 

 

 

_
Cats are remote and mean. They don ’t tell jokes, and when you tell one, they don’t laugh

This is my story:

Once upon a time, the ancestors of
dogs—wolves in layman’s language—
found the stresses and strains of life in a
hierarchical social species unbearable.
They lived in packs dominated by alpha
(not Alpo) males who pushed around all
the other males. Everybody knew every-
body else’s business. Nobody had any pri-
vacy. And on top of that they mated for

life. They did the only thing possible; they
developed a sense of humor. I

How this worked in terms of evolution-
ary genetics is that the dog ancestors that
had no sense of humor didn’t live long
enough to produce offspring. Put yourself
in the prom-dog’s position. Let’s say
you’re a young male wolf without a mate.
The rest of the males are always coming
out of the den in the morning with big grins
on their faces. By the time you get your
turn at the moose carcass, all that’s left are
the chewy parts. You can’t laugh it off, be-
cause you’re genetically incapable of hu-
mor, so you lose control and attack the al-
pha wolf. He kills you. You know what that
means—no offspring for you. Natural se-
lection has just eliminated your no-sense-
of-humor genes from the wolf gene pool.
I t has, by the way, been scientiﬁcally dem—

onstrated that wolves have a lot to laugh
off. In a study of the wolves on Isle Royale,
Mich., in Lake Superior, the wolves suc-
ceeded in killing the moose only six times in

- 131 moose hunts. If these wolves were a
"football team they would be the New Or-

leans Saints. With ancestors like that, you
end up appreciating the absurdity of life,

 

 

not to mention moose hunts. And when
you (a dog descendant) are faced with a hu-
man owner wielding a rolled up newspaper,
pointing to the rug, and shouting “Did you
do that?”, you do what your ancestors did
when they missed the moose. You stuff
your leg in your mouth and grin.

Cats are different. Cats have pride and
dignity. Animals that live in hierarchical
social systems (people, for instance) can

afford pride and dignity only if they’re
at the top of the ladder. If you’re a cat,
you are the ladder. Put yourself in the
proto-cat’s place. Odds are you’re a sol—
itary carnivore. You live alone. Once in
a great while you mate with a stranger
who also has claws. On an average day
you get up, kill something, eat it, and
go back to sleep. What’s funny? Laugh-
ing has no evolutionary beneﬁts, and
consequently you have no sense of hu-
mor. This is the evolutionary history of
domestic cats. This is why cats are re-
mote, independent, and mean. They
don’t tell jokes, and when you tell one,
they don’t laugh.

In other words, dogs are better
(Q.E.D.). And they’re more suited to us
as a species. If you “miss the moose” at

work a dog can sympathize with your
plight. If you like, you can even blame the
dog. It’s genetically prepared to take this in
good humor, and it will urge you to do the
same when unjust accusations are leveled
at you. In the same situation a cat will
scorn you for being weak, and point out
that when it feels bad, it kills something. I
don’t think this attitude is helpful. In fact, I
ﬁrmly believe that as a people (or perhaps I
should say “as people”) we’re less likely to
cause a nuclear war if we keep dogs, not
cats, as pets.

One ﬁnal note: I know that emotions
run high on this issue. It’s conceivable that
I might have offended some cat lovers, and
that they might want to send me insulting
letters, to which I would have to invent
clever replies. To save them and me a lot of
time and trouble, I thought I’d print the re-
ply I have ready for them right now. It’s a
quotation from Romanes. After describ-
ing the cruelty of cats he said something
that I like so much I’m adopting it as a re-
sponse to all letters about this piece, per-
haps to all letters about anything: “With

‘ regard to cats it is needless to dwell further

upon facts so universally known.”

WHY CATS ARE CAUSIIIG 'I'HE DECLINE 0F CIVILIZATION

here are times in

life when you have

to speak up. People

may heap calumny

‘ or contumely on

you, depending on

their vocabulary.

They may even ignore you. But

you can’t ignore the call of

conscience. I’m talking about

. the kind of moral imperative

3 that made Rachel Carson write

Silent Spring and the Kingston

? Trio sing about Charlie on

The MTA. Not that I put my-

, self in the same moral class

: as the Kingston Trio, but I

‘ too have a message that I feel

: compelled to deliver, whatever

the consequences: dogs are
better than cats.

I don’t mean that I like dogs
. better than cats. Nor do I mean
%, that dogs are better for certain
things, like feet warming, while
5 cats are better for other things,
like appearing in fashion adver-
tisements. I’m not saying that
dogs are better looking than cats, or smart-
er, or that they have more cartoons drawn
of them. They’re certainly not cleaner.
However, dogs have a sense of humor. Cats
don’t. And I can prove it. That sense of hu-
mor is what makes dogs better—purely, ab-
solutely, ontologically better.

The only reason I bring this up is that I
think cats are causing the decline of civili-
zation. Two prime examples of their effect
on modern life are the disappearance of lit-
eracy and the appalling condition of mod-
ern bookstores, both directly attributable
not to MTV but to cat books and calendars.
If you look at these things you’ll see that
they’re full of pictures and cartoons. Dog
books have words. Think of what dogs
have done for literature: Lad: A Dog and
The Call of the Wild, the tales and car-
toons of Thurber, even Snoopy, who, al-
though a cartoon character, appears in a
strip in which the name Beethoven is
occasionally mentioned. Ranged against
these we have Garﬁeld and his sort, who
monopolize all the good spots near the cash
register. What would Shakespeare say?

 

BY JAMES GORMAN

Dogs have a sense of humor. Cats don ’t.
That sense of humor is what makes dogs better-
purely, absolutely, and ontologically

I also blame cats for the rise of narcis-
sism. Cats are the ultimate narcissists. You
can tell this because of all the time they
spend on personal grooming. Dogs aren’t
like this. A dog’s idea of personal groom-
ing is to roll in a dead ﬁsh. Dogs spend their
time thinking about doing good deeds for
their masters, or sleeping. The rise in crime
may be another result of the rise of cats.
They’re certainly more violent than dogs
(with the exception of doberman pin-
schers, which I think are cats in disguise).
Cats don’t bark and act brave when they
see something small in fur or feathers, they
kill it. Dogs tend to bravado. They’re brag-
garts. In the great evolutionary drama the
dog is Sergeant Bilko, the cat is Rambo.

Implicit in my criticism of cats is what
might be called the “petogenic” theory of
culture. We’ve known for a long time that
individual persons tend to resemble their
pets. I think the same is true of societies.
Do we want to become a nation of Mor-
rises? 15 America to be nothing more than
a picky eater? Even physiologically cats
are ﬁnicky; they’re obligate carnivores, or

 

strict meat-eaters. Dogs, on the
other hand (or mouth), are om-
nivores in the true sense of the
word. Waste not, want not is
the motto of all dogs. They live
in a permanent Third World of
the mind where the notion of
throwing out food is incompre-
hensible. Let even a King
Charles spaniel off its leash and
it will head straight for the
neighbor’s garbage can, where
it will consume anything that’s .
edible, or has been next to 2
, something edible, and spread
f ' the rest around the street. I
think this is done for moral and 1
comic purposes, as well as
those of appetite. While cats
are lying on divans waiting for
the next ﬂavor surprise, dogs
are reproaching us for throw-
ing out perfectly good gristle.
I didn’t make this up about 1
dogs having a sense of humor. 1'
Well, actually I did make it up. ,
Then I found that some famous ‘
dead scientists agreed with me,
like Charles Darwin. In The Descent of '
Man he said, “Dogs show what may be
fairly called a sense of humour.” In this ;
opinion he was supported by George Ro- »
manes, another great man of science, also
dead, in whose work I found the Darwin ?
quotation. Romanes was one of the 1
founders of the study of animal behavior '
and he credited dogs, but not cats, with
“the emotion of the ludicrous.”
What Romanes did credit the cat with .
was “disadvantages of temperament.” I ‘
think he meant that cats aren’t nice. There
are those who say that when cats torture :
crippled mice (which they themselves '
have crippled) they’re not enjoying them-
selves. You might as well say that William
Buckley doesn’t enjoy winning arguments.
As Romanes says, “The feelings that ‘
prompt a cat to torture a captured mouse 3
can only, I think, be assigned to the catego-
ry to which by common consent they are
ascribed—delight in torturing for torture’s
sake.” Needless to say, neither Romanes ,
nor I believe that laughing at a crippled '
mouse counts as having a sense of humor. i

Business Is

Warm summer Sunday after-
noons in upscale Marin

County, north of San Francisco, are
pastoral gems enhanced with soft,
brushstroked Clouds. Mariners often
take advantage of these days to attend
free outdoor brunches on a grassy
lawn near Larkspur Landing. On
weekdays, the quaint shopping area
is normally filled with blue-suited
commuters waiting for ferryboats to
take them into the city, but these
Sundays are left for about 80 guests
to eat quiche and sip champagne.

Some may think this high style of
living is a dog’s life. They are right.
All the guests at this Sunday brunch
are dogs. The mutts munch on all-
natural “kibble quiche,” homemade
dog biscuits, and a cream cheese
treat garnished with health food
called “wheat-germ woofies.” The
champagne is not for the dogs, how-
ever. It’s what the pets’ owners
drink. As a social affair, the Bowser
brunch is a must on many Marin ca-
nine calendars.

“These are literally pampered
pooches,” says Marilyn Ascher,
whose small white poodle, Nicole,
has shown up at brunch garbed in a
Western cowgirl outfit and White
cowgirl hat. By pampered, Ascher
means the dogs are very well-cared
for by people who consider them
part of the family.

 

THE BRUNCH CLUB—Everyone’s
barking about Patricia Monahan ’5
branches for dogs, held outside For
Paws, her trendy pet boutique in
Larkspur, California. The dogs ap-
parently love to socialize, and peo-
ple enjoy it, too.

The brunches may be fun for the
dogs, she says, but “the people are

the circuit, but at first, says Ascher,
she was a shy pup. “Now she gets on

buffet table. She’s getting to be quite
'a little ham.” Then she adds, “I hope

Networking Nibblers

The dogs and their owners meet on
the first Sunday of every month from
May through October, courtesy of Pa-
tricia Monahan, a 25-year Marin resi-
dent who claims to know just about
every dog in the county. The gather-
ing is supposed to be casual, but
some of the dogs are dressed to the
teeth in fashionable imported sweat-
ers, bright-colored caps, and rhine-
stone collars.

Many of the items were likely
bought in Monahan’s trendy pet bou-
tique, the outside of which is the set-
ting for these Fido feasts. Monahan
Started her store, called For Paws,
about the same time she began the
brunches. A provision of her rent
agreement demanded that her store
remain open on Sundays, so she de-
cided to use the time to throw a
party. What started with eight dogs
has grown to 80, and though she’s
not barking over its success, the
brunches have certainly added paw
traffic to her business.

“It’s my way of getting people to-
gether with their animals and having
a good time,” says Monahan, who
used to run a kennel in nearby No-
vato before catering to the gourmet
taStes of the pet set. Some local pet
owners call her “dog’s best friend.”

In the four years the brunches have
been served, she says, the only dis-
ruptions have been the sounds of the
dogs licking their chops and the oc-
casional clamor of barking. Never,
Monahan claims, has there been a
dog fight. That goes for the people,
too. “The dogs are busy eating their
quiche, and the people are happy,”
she says proudly. The animals are on
their best behavior, making new
friends and renewing old acquaint-
ances at each monthly brunch. There
are, she says, no wallflowers and no

prejudices among the pooches.
Mixed breeds and purebreds share
plates of food and nuzzle each other.

Pet Paradise

The inside of For Paws is a proper
pet’s paradise. Hand-knit wool
sweaters from England come in sizes
that could fit a Great Dane or a toy
poodle. A dog owner can buy gour-
met dog treats for a few dollars. For
about $80, there are brass beds and
even waterbeds for dogs. A dog with
an active lifestyle could encourage
envious yips in one of the pastel jog-
ging suits that For Paws sells. “Marin
is great for jogging,” says Monahan.

Cat owners need not feel
declawed. About half the merchan-
dise is feline-oriented, and the beds
are for both animals. That’s where
the equality ends. Monahan says un-
like dogs, cats are not clotheshorses,
and they also don’t do well at
brunches. “Cats don’t socialize like
dogs,” she says. “They just don’t ap-
preciate overcrowded situations.”

Most dogs, however, are purebred
party animals. Besides the brunches,
Monahan also holds fundraising
bashes to benefit the Marin Humane
Society, where she serves on the
board of directors.

A summertime beach party last

year complete with palm trees, a
plastic pool, and patio furniture at-
tracted 200 sun-worshipping mutts
in shorts and bikinis, sunglasses, and
tanning lotion. More than 50 dogs
competed for the title of “Ms. Ma-
rin.” The winning pup and her
owner wore matching swimsuits.

The social season culminates with
a Halloween party for dogs, also to
benefit the Humane Society. One
poodle named Esme came as a skunk.
A spaniel wore a Tarzan costume, as
did its owner, a San Francisco attor-
ney. A purebred doberman called
Blitz donned a blond wig and a ﬂap-
per skirt and came as a “lady of the
evening.”

Geri Goldman, Blitz’s owner, says
her dog likes “socializing with all
the other dogs” and was generally
well-behaved, with one except-ion:
“She jumped on the table and
grabbed about 15 cookies,” says
Goldman, who adds that although
the scene was embarrassing, the dog
just couldn’t help it. “That’s ex-
pected of Blitz,” Goldman explains.
“She’s a compulsive eater.” Blitz,
weighing more than 50 pounds.
liked everything but the wig, which
she had trouble keeping on her head.
“She doesn’t mind things on the rest
of her,” says Goldman. “I think her
favorite outfit is her backpack and
leg warmers. I guess you’d call it her
hiking outfit.”

When they’re together, at least,
these dogs are not exactly the type to
catch Frisbees in their mouths or
swim in shallow waves. For one
thing, it would ruin their clothes.
Still, Monahan puts a muzzle on the
suggestion that these are 'unusually
pampered pups. “People are very
humane in this area,” she says.
“They’re very conscious, very aware
of their pets. A pet is really a part of
their lives. It’s their love child.”

Many Marin dog owners bring their
pets to For Paws for a shopping spree
or just to hang around and talk.
Monahan will answer any canine-re-
lated questions if she’s qualified. For
Paws, she adds, “is basically a com-
munity educational center. It’s a
meeting place. It’s anything but just a
pet shop.” One dog owner, in fact,
says her pup makes a beeline for the
store whenever her car pulls into the
Larkspur Landing parking lot.

“I basically know every dog in Ma-
rin,” says Monahan, but she admits

' Dog subpoenaed

By CHERYL MICHAELS
Tribune Staff Writer

 

Every dog has his day and Baron, a 3-year-old
tracking dog for the Plant City Police Department,
was no exception.

The 85«pound German shepherd was subpoe-
naed to appear in court the week of March 31.

“You are hereby commanded to appear before
Judge (Manuel) Menendez,” a subpoena delivered
Feb. 27 shows. “And this you shall nowise omit.”

As it turned out, Baron’s fame as a star state
witness was short-lived.

Assistant State Attorney Mike Peacock, who
subpoenaed the dog as a' witness against Terry
Sumner, said Thursday it was a mistake.

“The-subpoena was issued in error,” Peacock
said upon learning Baron was a dog. “It was my
error.”

Laughing, Peacock added: “I’ ll tell him he’s not
needed.”

Sumner, 22, of 2611 Jim Johnson Road, is
scheduled for trial March 31 on a sexual battery
charge. Peacock said Barron unsuccessfully at-
tempted to track the suspect after a rape Sept. 20.
near the Plant City Mall.

Although Peacock was surprised he subpoe-.
naed a dog, a Hillsborough County sheriff’s deputy
who delivered the subpoena to the Police Depart-
ment wasn’t.

“I did a double take,” Deputy" Ralph Springer
said later. “But I figure if the court wants him sub-
poenaed, they have that right.” .

Baron’s owner, Plant City police Officer Jim
Travis, signed the subpoena .for his pet — in disbe-
lief. He said he was tempted to dress the dog up,
take him in, and collect his witness fee.

“He has such a big head all of a sudden,”

Travis joked. “He’s wearing his badge wherever he . . . , .
goes.” ‘ hIS dog Baron, who is used 0:, it‘s? t”:j:£.vf.«,v :

HOUSTON CHRONICLE {‘DUiSianaIS big-beaked
symbol thriving again

March 2, 1986

 

By GUY COATES
Associated Press

 

GRAND CHENIERE, La. -— The
Louisiana state flag whips from the
staff in front of the Rockefeller Wild-
life Refuge, a reminder of what was
once an embarrassment.

The flag depicts the official symbol
of the state -—- the brown pelican, which
ceased to exist along Louisiana’s teem-
ing marshes in 1963.

“They just disappeared,” said David
Richard, a biologist for the Depart-
ment of Wildlife and Fisheries. “The
exact reason has not been proven but
the theory is that pesticides was a rea-
son, as was the subsidence of nesting
colonies on the barrier islands due to
severe hurricanes and weather
changes.” ,

Beginning in 1968, Louisiana asked
Florida for help and the pelican was
reintroduced. After a few setbacks, the
population took hold and now the birds
are thriving.

The pelican, with its white head and
brownish-white body, was originally so
common that the Legislature made it
the official state bird more than 50
years ago. When Huey Long built the
state Capitol, he had the bird’s big-
beaked profiled emblazoned through-
out on doors and murals.

Biologists had estimated that Loui-
siana had 50,000 breeding pairs in the
19403, but by 1950 the p0pu1ation began
decreasing until, in 1963, a check by
department teams found not a single
bird.

Richard said he was concerned late
last year after the coast and barrier
islands were battered by three hurri—
canes.

“We did have erosion at all sites but
found that the islands were still suit-
able for nesting and seemed to have
fared well,” said Richard. “In fact, one
colony is already nesting and another
will be nesting shortly. We’ll be flying
over the areas in a few weeks to check
on the results.”

Colonies have been established at
North Island in the Chandeleur Island
chain and at Queen Bess-Camp Island
in Barataria Bay.

“We think it has been an astounding
success story,” said Richard, “and it’s
getting bigger and bigger, re-establis-
hing them in their original range.”

Now, he said, the de artment is
studying a way to transp ant birds to
the western part of the Louisiana coast.
Historically, the birds ranged only in
the eastern portion of the coastal area,
leaving a gap of several hundred miles
from central Louisiana to near Galves-
ton.

Ultimately, the birds will have to
move closer to the coastal marshes for
nesting, said Richard. “The erosion of
the barrier islands will continue due to
storms but that’s way down the line.”

The only setbacks came in 1973 and
1974, when man birds died and aut0p-
sies found letha doses of pesticides.

“The Mississippi River has been a
mixed blessing,” Richard said, “origi-
nally giving us the lush delta and the
marshes, but at the same time it’s the
drainage area of the nation’s farms.
Pesticide runoffs gather in the Missis-
sippi and are dumped into the Gulf of
Mexico.

“In the brown pelican there was a
magnification of the pesticides. The
fish will eat the smaller fish, picking up
the pesticide. The pelican eats an awful
lot of fish. A whole lot of pennies make
a dollar.”

One reason Florida has so many of
the birds is that it doesn’t have a pesti-
cide funnel like the Mississippi, Rich-
ard noted.

The pesticide problem hasn’t been as
great in recent years and biologists
aren’t positive just why, other than that
there are more controls on the use of
pesticides.

“We’ve got a p0pulation now of from
4,000 to 5,000 birds and about 1,000
breeding pairs,” Richard said. “We’re
seeing an increase each year. We’ve got
our symbol back.”

America ’5 Ugliest Mutt L up:
Up $2 00 in Enquirer Contest

When Linda Newlin walks her dog Baldy, people
often say, “Where did you get that ugly dog?” But
they’re not being insulting, because Baldy’s been

picked as the Ugliest Dog

in America!

Baldy, a freckled, frazzle-haired cross between a Manchester

terrier and a poodle, is the win-
ner of The ENQUIRER‘S latest
fun contest to find the most ri-
diculous-looking pooch in the
nation.

“Many people won’t even pet him
because of the way he looks,” says
his owner Linda, of St. Francisville,
Ill. “They think he’s sick because he
has so little hair.

“The first time the veterinarian
saw Baldy, even he said: ‘God,

what’s the matter with him?’ Chil-
dren tend to be afraid of him be-
cause he’s so ugly.”

Linda wins $200 for being the
owner of the homeliest entry in the
contest, which was announced in our
issue published January 7.

Baldy was one of four pups born
six years ago to Linda’s Mandhester
Fiffy. She also owns Baldy’s father,
Sugar the poodle.

“Baldy was so ugly that I felt
sorry for him and decided to
keep him. I figured nobody
would love him like we do."

Because Baldy has only
scattered patches of gray
hair on his body, his bald
parts tend to sunburn and
freckle easily, Linda said.

“He has freckles all over
his body. ,

“In the summer I have to
rub suntan oil on his head or
he sunburns and gets blis-
ters.

“During the winter he
doesn’t like to go out. He suf-
fers from the cold and has to
wear a coat. '

“He shivers and gets bron-
chitis easily.”

But the 71/2-pound mutt is
a good watchdog and is lov-
able, adds Linda. “When

backdrop had to be moved be-
cause some zoo officials feared a
tiger might be able to climb it and
use it as a platform to jump out of
the compound. ' L
Fences separating the public
from the cats have been moved
more than once to improve securi-
ty and a “hot wire” — an electri-
cally charged cable — has been
added to help discourage the ani-
mals from trying to ﬂee. The wire
even stretches around a moat in
which tigers swim in the com-
pound. ,

“We didn’t push those changes
because there was any danger to
the public,” Gilbert said. “It’s al-
most an impossibility for a cat to

get out into a public area. We just _

want to super-ensure security.” ,
Yet another problem involved
landscaping. "
Focke said great care went into
selecting plants for the compound:
“We wanted everything to be as
natural as possible. In addition,
we had to worry about whether
some of the
plants would
be toxic to the

animals.” ,

But when
the compound
opened, all
that work was

Focke said.

son said. “I haven’t laughed about

Dan Jones, city public works

also is upset with the overruns.
“And we don’t feel the taxpayers

added.

'PrOblems at the zoo

 

A recent visit to the Cleveland
Metroparks 200 left me puzzled on
several counts. On my arrival, I disco-
vered that the early free admission
period had been eliminated and that
admission charges had been raised.
This would not have been upsetting
had the policy been adequately publi-
cized. I found, however, that several
employees were unaware of the

'change.

This failure to communicate with
the public—or the 200 personnel—
seems symptomatic of the 200’s
administration. Zoo employees were
embarrassed and confused when
asked about the plans for the reloca-

' . tion of the Cleveland Aquarium exhi-

bits. They told me that the informa-
tion had not been properly
communicated to them. The recent
episodes involving the euthanasia of
the Siberian tiger and the disposal of
the animals at the children‘s farm
indicate the larger failures to com-
municate effectively with the public.

This inability to communicate
extends to the educational programs.
The zoo has five fulLtime employees
in its education department, which is
headed by a staff member whose sal-
ary exceeds $40,000, yet the exhibits
and graphics are far from state of the
art. Likewise, contact with schools has
not kept pace with the needs of the
students. I know from my own experi-
ence as a school principal as well as a
zoo visitor how far short of expecta-
tions these programs fall.

Given the increased level of tax-
payer support of the zoo in recent
years, and the genuine efforts to
upgrade the physical facility, it is dis-
tressing to see this valuable asset
endangered by poor administrative
leadership and the declining employee
morale to which this has led I urge
your readers to monitor this situation
with greater care in the future.

THE HOUSTON POST - Feb. 9, 1986

200 costs soar Project's bUdget overruns i

as lions roar

By JOHN GRAVOIS
Post Reporter

 

The biggest attraction at the Houston Zoo — the
new, large cat compound — has run up almost $1
million in cost overruns, largely because of design
work that some zoo keepers say was botched by one of
the city’s most noted architectural firms.

One of the problems was illustrated in dramatic
fashion recently when John Focke, a top official for
the architectural firm, CRS Sirrine, was invited to
confront a lion by senior zoo keeper John Gilbert.

At an appropriate moment — as Focke stood inches
away from a lion named Bean, with only a cage fence
separating the two —— Gilbert made a hand gesture
that caused Bean to jump and roar ferociously, shak-
ing the cage violently and shocking Focke.

“That lion shook the whole building,” said Focke,
senior vice president of public affairs for CRS Sirrine.
It was especially intimidating because the lion had
been “chewing up a bowling ball” immediately before

he jumped and roared.

“It certainly got my attention. We agreed to make

the (design) change after that,” he said.

The firm’s original design called for a chain-link-
style of fencing that allowed some ﬂexibility in the)

law-"W ,, * ~~
cage walls. However, the zoo keep-
ers who handle 450-pound tigers,
lions and other cats felt unsafe
with that flexibility. They de~
manded more rigid fencing.

But CRS Sirrine — which has
helped build defense systems in
Saudi Arabia, cereal processing
plants in China and office build-
ings 1n Korea — wasn’t at all con-
v1nced the fence material for
which it called was inadequate.

So Gilbert arranged a behind-
the-scenes tour for Focke and city
officials.

Gilbert defended setting up
Bean’s display of aggression, say-
mg: “I wanted to show those peo-
ple the true potential for danger. It
was effective, too. It shows that
sometimes actions speak louder
than words.”

At the time, Gilbert said he had
no idea his little display would ul-
timately cost taxpayers hundreds
of thousands of dollars. “But I feel
like 1t’s money well spent,” he
said. “Remember, we’re talking
about safety here.”

In all, design problems with the
cat compound, part of which is
still under construction, have
raised the project’s original $5.5
million construction budget to al-
most $6.4 million.

More than $700,000 worth of the
extra work has been attributed to
deficiencies by CRS Sirrine in de-
SIgning the compound’s interior
cages. The most recent change or-
der — a $307,000 contract —— was

\f/

approved last week by the City
Council.

CRS Sirrine officials have
vowed to pay a “fair share” of the
cost overruns and now are negoti-
ating the matter with city offi-
cials. The company has handled
projects worth hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars for local govern-
mental agencies.

Zoo officials stressed that their
safety concerns focused on cat
keepers, not the public because it
would be all but impossible for a
cat to escape the interior cage
complex even if it gets out of its
individual cage.

“Our philosophy is you can nev-
er be too safe,” said Gilbert.
“With these animals, you some-
times don’t get a second chance
when it comes to safety.”

Focke and zoo director John
Werler agree there’s a chance the
original, flexible cage material
would have proved adequate.

“We still think it was structur-
ally strong enough, but it wasn’t
what they were accustomed to be-
cause of the ﬂexibility,” Focke
said, adding that the suggested
material was modeled after the
fences used to cage the cats at the
London Zoo.

Focke said his firm searched
around the world for an expert
consultant to help them design the
fence. “There just weren’t any
around, though. This is a unique
field,” he said.

linked to safety concerns

“The question really was about
the material’s integrity over the
long haul,” Werler said. “We
might have gotten by without the
change, but we determined the
change was the safe way to pro-
ceed.”

The change in cage materials
proved to be not only costly, but
time consuming. The cat com-
pound’s spring opening was
pushed back to November.

The compound became the 200’s
most popular attraction overnight,
touting a pair of recently acquired
white Bengal tigers as its biggest
stars.

Until the new compound
opened, the cats were kept in con-
crete block houses separated from
the public by glass and steel bars.
Now they roam more freely in
large Plexiglas and wire-fenced
enclosures, each designed to re-
semble the cats’ natural environ-
ment.

The interior cages in question
are out of public view.

The cage material hasn’t been
the project’s only problem.

Killer Wlmle
Feeds Sea Gull

A killer whale feeding a sea
gull? As incredible as it seems,
that’s just what you're seeing in
this fascinating sequence of
photos. Biossa, a female killer
whale at Canada’s Vancouver
Aquarium, began feeding the
birds around her pool all on her
own! When she sees a sea gull
at the edge of the pool, the two
ton whale swims over to it with
bits of fish in her teeth — and
the sea gulls pluck them right
out. Aquarium officials say
they know of no other case in
which a whole has fed birds.

iHE HOUSTON CHRONICLE - March 6, 1986

Mutilated remains of
3 horses discovered
at downtown bank

 

‘By MARK CARREAU
:Houston Chronicle

A startled downtown bank customer
{stumbled onto a grisly scene called as
ijpuzzling as it was shocking. _

An unidentified woman discovered
the mutilated bodies of three small
Welsh horses at the MBank drive-in fa-
cilities at Preston and Louisiana.

’ Investigators said the bodies appear
to have been arranged in a crude trian~
-gle and that one, that of a 2-year-old
gsimare. appears to have been sexually
‘.mutilated.
The discovery, about 3 am. Wednes~
gday. appears to be the latest of four
.similar incidents. over aifour'month pe-
‘iiod, lending more credence to the the-
aory that some sort of cult is re-
4‘1‘sponsible, said George Huebner. chief
pruelty investigator for the Associated
Humane Societies.
Each previous case involved horses
L‘killed, mutilated and dumped at an-
other site, he said.
' “I suspect this is part of some type of
{ritual and that someone wants some
j-type of attention,” said Huebner. “The
«ything we are really wondering about is
:whether this is some satanic thing."
; ’ The humane agency offered a $1,000
fareward for information leading to an
:Sarrest.
‘ Houston police said the hindquarters
:jhad been severed from what appeared
a to be two light brown stallions about 6
months to a year old. Their intestines
; ,were intermingled, and the tails, legs
and hoofs had also been cut off and the
i‘body parts placed within a crude trian-
t‘gle formed by the trunks.
y An autopsy revealed at least one
{stallion had been shot in the head, and
E the bay-colored mare was fairly intact

Eimalnourished, said Huebner.
it: There 'was little blood at the site,
gieading investigators to believe the ani-
slmals had been killed and mutilated
iielsewhere.
f; The mutilations obliterated any iden-

ta

tifying brands, forcing investigators to

comb stolen animal reports for poten-

tial leads to the owners.

“It’s a horrendous scene,” said police
spokesman J. C. Mosier, a former ho
micide investigator. “To look at the
photographs makes you sick at your
stomach. I have seen a lot, but this is so
inhumane. Anyone who would do this
has to be sick.”

Mosier was skeptical of suggestions
the bodies had been carefully arranged
in a triangle. Police and MBank
spokesman Dick Bryant said there was 2
nothing to indicate the mutilations
were directed at the bank as some sort
of message. .3

“It just appears to me this was a '
convenient spot to dump the animals."
said Mosier. “About all we can call it
now is animal cruelty. Whether or not.
this involved satanic mutilations, noth-
ing leads us in that direction, but we
certainly couldn’t rule it out.”

For nearly two decades, discoveries
of bizarre cattle and horse mutilations
in Texas. Arkansas, Oklahoma, Color-
ada and states as far west as Washing-
ton have fueled speculation that
cultists, secret military biological and
chemical warfare and even aliens from
outer space were responsible.

Typically, the animals are discov-
ered vitually bloodless and often their
sexual organs appear to have been mu-
tilated or removed.

Most of the deaths can be traced to
humans engaged in animal cruelty or
to vultures, coyotes or other predators,
said Dr. Conrad Eugster, head of the
diagnostic laboratory at the College of
Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&M
University.

Eugster participated in the examina—
tion of the carcasses of cattle involved
in mysterious deaths in Texas during
the late 19705. It was determined that
natural predators were responsible for r
all of them, he said.

Houston humane officials asked that
anyone with information about Wed-
nesday’s mutilations contact the Asso-
ciated Humane Societies at 497-5656.

 

  




‘ THE .MAIN DEALER, SUNDAY, MARCH 2, 1986‘

   

Animal rights activists

spaipps HOWARD

' BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. - As
more than 100 demonstrators hoisted
placards the other day outside a res-
taurant on Santa Monica Blvd. here, a
dozen of their allies were lying in
front of construction equipment in
Berkeley, 400 miles to the north.

' Both demonstrations opened new
fronts in a steadily spreading national
campaign for animal rights.

At Berkeley, protestors sought to

 

_ prevent construction of a laboratory .

building where scientific experiments
using animals will be conducted.

, Here, the protest was against milk-
fed veal, with demonstrators trying to
expand the animal-rights movement
to include farm animals.

“If peeple know how farm animals
are treated, they’d make major
changes in their diets,” said Brad
Miller, executive director of the
Humane Farming Association, based
in San Rafael, Calif.

“We object particularly to milk-fed
veal because veal calves are taken
from their mothers on the day they’re
born, kept in 22-inch-wide crates with
no light for the entire 16 weeks of
their life and kept deliberately ane-
mic so their meat will be white.”

Even though the animal rights
movement hasn’t had much impact
yet on farmers and eateries, it has
been strongly felt in scientific labora-
tories.

Organizations from the American
Psychological Association to the
National Institutes of Health have,
adOpted new standards for care of
laboratory animals.

They said, though, that medical
advances ranging from the X-ray to
penicillin to antibiotics stem from
experiments using animals. '

The impact on labs comes largely
because of three well-publicized raids
staged in the past year at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, the University of
California at Riverside and the City of
Hope medical center outside Los
Angeles.

Masked, midnight raiders who
broke into the three laboratories
destroyed more than $1 million worth
of experiments and made films used
later to convince Congress to include
humane provisions in farm bills and
research appropriations.

Police called the raids burglaries.
Scientists called them “terrorism.”

The raiders said they are merely

“liberating” animals.

becoming more
militan

. “The raids by the Animal Libera-
tion Front have helped people become
more aware and outraged at the fact
that their tax dollars are being spent
this way,” said Laurie Gruen,
research coordinator for an 80,000-
member group called People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals.

PETA, based in Washington, DC, is
the lead organization in the Animal
Liberation Front, though it denies
havmg orchestrated any raids.

PETA’s eventual goal, as outlined
by Los Angeles chapter coordinator
Lucy Shelton, who led the La Scala
demonstrators, goes well beyond the
labs:

“Our organization would like to see
all animals left alone. Since it’s not
necessary for us to eat them, we’d like
to see them allowed to enjoy what’s
available in the world. We’d also like
to see the day when no animal is
experimented upon.”

PETA leaders call themselves
“vegans” — vegetarians who eat no
eggs or dairy food and wear no
leather.

The animal activists know they’re a
long way from converting most
Americans to those practices, so
they’re willing to accept lesser mea
sures.

“We don’t require that everyone ,

who joins us be a vegetarian, although
most of our top people are,” said
Gruen. “But we ask pe0ple to end cru-
elty to animals in any way they can,
even if it’s only giving up veal or not
eating meat once a week.”

The pro-animal movement so far
has spurred no changes in farming,
but on paper there have been changes
at many labs around the nation.

“We rely very much on the good
will of the public, since the majority
of funding for research comes from
the taxpayers,” said Kevin O’Connor,
a top official of the Federation of
American Societies for Experimental
Biology. To satisfy the animal-loving
public, he said, virtually every experi-
mental facility now has an animal

' care committee reviewing all experi-

mental procedures.

New rules also force laboratories
getting federal funds to file written
assurances of humane care of animals
with the US. Public Health Service.

l

And the Agriculture Department
lately has begun enforcing the 20-
year-old Animal Welfare Act with
new vigor, fining labs at the City of
Hope and the University of California
at Berkeley and causing delays in
about $1 million worth of grants at the

. City of Hepe. ~

“We’re paying greater attention to
using as few animals as possible,”

said Charles Mathews, spokesman for
the City of Rape, where activists

“liberated” 106 animals last Decem—
' her in a midnight raid.

“We’re always seeking alternative
methods like cell and tissue cultures
and computer techniques,” Mathews
said. “But there are still plenty of
situations where the use of animals
has to happen — things like testing
potential vaccines, anti-cancer drugs
and antibiotics. Animals are also vital
for education. Most pe0ple want their
heart surgeons to practice on animals
, before they work on humans.”

Despite the raids and the new rules,
most scientists say their research is
largely unaffected by the animal
rights movement.

 

"‘lt’sbeen a bureaucratic hassle for
us, said Dr. Peter Elias, a dermatol-
ogy. reseacher at the University of
California’s San Francisco medical
center. “Each campus has its own
revxews of all experimental protocols
and anesthetics and euthanasia for
animals. This kind of sentimentality
hasn’t changed one of our experi-

 

 

ments, but it has created a lot of
paper work. We now have to go
through much the same protocols we
do for human experiments.”

To the activists, that looks like
progress.

“We don’t deny there have been
advances through animal experi-

ments,” said PETA’s Gruen. “But in a
high-technology society there are bet-
ter ways to do it. Vivisection is anti-
quated and unreliable. We think
there’s a gradual shift in that

NEW YORK TIMES - March 11, 1986

European Bison, Bred of Zoo Stock,
Roam the Wild Again

 

They lumber unafraid
in Polish preserve.

 

By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 

Special to The New York Times

. lALOWIEZA, Poland, March

11.5" 7 - The hulking European

bison that ' once survived

, *7» ., only in zoos are lumbering
unafraid these days along the Polish-

Soviet border in an old czarist hunting
preserve where the last of their un-
penned ancestors died out 67 years
ago.

‘ “They were once extinct in the
wild, but they have come back,” ex-
plained Zbigniew Krasinski, a veteri-
narian who has spent 25 years work-
ing with the animals he describes as
calm and clever. “We have 238 bison
now wandering the national park.”

_“This, we think, is just the right
number to balance the elk, the moose,
the other animals and to protect the
plant life of this rare forest,” he said.

Isolation Aided Survival

. Czeslaw Okolow is the senior scien-
tist and the curator of the museum in
this small community in the Bia-
lowieza Forest national park. He was
born in the region and he regards the
protection of this nature preserve as a
personal and passionate mission.

; “We are one of 13 places in the
.world designated a world heritage
10cation by UNESCO, one of only two
in Europe, the other being the dormi-
:tor canyon in Yugoslavia,” Mr. Oko— '
Jow said.

. j, He went on to explain that because
-the forest was isolated for centuries
jas a game preserve for czars and be-
fore them for Polish kings, the trees,
.shrubs, flowers and animals contain
:genetic material and strains that
‘have disappeared or have been di-
luted elsewhere as timber was cut or

forest turned into farmland.

“That is why the bison survived
here as long as they did after vanish-
ing everywhere else in Europe,” said
Mr. Okolow.

None Left by 1919

Images of the bison, a somewhat
larger animal with a more prominent

, hump than the American plains bison
i commonly called buffalo, have been

' found etched in caves and on stones in :

many parts of EurOpe. The animals
are believed to have died out in Eng-
land in the 11th century and in France
in the 14th. Just before World War I
g there were only several hundred of

them in the Bialowieza preserve and

a smaller group in the Caucasus.

“The first World War marked the .

end of the czars and the end of bison
as well,” said Dr. Krasinski. The ani-
mals had been killed, and by 1919
none were left in the forest or the
Caucasus.

In 1923, an independent Poland,
' newly reborn after 125 years of im-
gperial partition, began an interna-
tional effort to breed new wild herds
from stock that had been given to zoos
and aristocrats, as had been done
with the plains buffalo in the United
States.

A number of the animals were
brought here but essentially, said Mr.
Okolow, all the bison wandering the
forest on this side of the fence that
marks the Soviet border and a like
number on the Soviet side are de-
scendents of one bull named Borusse
and two cows named Biscaya and Bi-
serta.

Patronage of Goring

The Polish and Soviet herds, which
are of similar size, have had no con—
tact with each other since the fence

_ was put up shortly after the Soviet

Union acquired the Eastern portions
of prewar Poland, including half of
the Bialowieza reserve.

This was not the first time that
political and economic geography af-
fected the fate of Bialowieza’s bison.

At first they thrived because the
czar’s retainers could enforce ukases
prohibiting farming around the pre-
serve, an oasis of Norway spruce, oak

and tall pines. Then the animals per-'

ished in war.

In the years before World War II,

Hermann Goring, Hitler’s second in
command, came to know of the bison
when he hunted in the Polish park,
and during the war, when the region
was occupied by the Nazis, he ex-

tended his patronage to the bison
herd. At the "‘end of the war, there

' were 44 bison in the forest; 23 animals
had been killed in fighting.

Hay Put Out in Winter

Tanks and mortars altered the for- "

the ground. Since then, the bison,
watched over by a staff of naturalists,
have grown in numbers.

The 20 matriarchial herds spend
the Vsummerﬁmonths scattered in the

dense forest. In winters they congre-
gate in clearings where park rangers
leave hay. This is done to prevent T
damage to trees, whose bark the
bison would feed on if there was no

smaller parks where tourists, most of

them Germans, pay about $2,000 for

the right to shoot one. .
The animals are not timid nor are
they quick and elusive. To a non- .
hunter they seem about as hard to hit
as a pickup truck with four flat tires.
There are records of hunting parties
in which Csar Alexander and his wife

shot 30 bison as beaters chased them .

b .

yBut if the forest has suffered dam-
aged in great cataclysmic events
such as war and changing borders, it
has been spared much of the ravages
of industrial progress and modernity. .

Tucked away, far from industrial
centers, the air is clean and fresh. .
Tourists who want to visit large areas -
of the park must do so on foot, and, in :
the surrounding areas, farmers are
forbidden to use chemical fertilizers
and no new plants are allowed to be
introduced.

‘Nothing Stands ‘Still’

“Naturally, we can’t put the whole
park under a glass dome and nature
itself is dynamic,” said Mr. Okolow,
pointing to the welter of thick fallen
branches that dotted the landscape.
“We had a catastrophic event last
week when heavy wet snow fell, and
there was no wind to blow it off the
trees. The weight of the snow simply
tore big healthy branches off trees.
No one can recall anything like this.”

The snowfall was an example of a
sudden change, but Mr. Okolow also
aso noted slower change, such as the
proliferation and spread of an animal
known as the raccoon dog. This beast,
which originally inhabited parts of
Mongolia, was hunted for its fur in the
1930’s, specifically for jackets for
Soviet airmen. The animal, which
looks something like a fox, was intro-
duced into forests far from its origi-
nal home and has now spread
throughout Europe, where it has be-
come a major pest and disease carri-
er.
“People think that in a primeval
forest, time stands still,” said Mr.
Okolow. “That’s wrong — nothing
stands still.”

Dear Dallas columnist

Bradley McDonald couldn’t stop smil»

ing. The grin on his 10-year—old freckled -

face was one of pure enjoyment as he sat
atop Frosty, a drowsy- looking white horse
. with immense patience

“There’s no doubt about it, he loves it,”
Pam McDonald remarked as she watched
her son ride around the large yard with
three volunteers at his side at all times. _‘

The Mesquite youngster was one of four
children with cerebral palsy who began an
eight- week program Saturday morning
with TROT, Therapeutic Riding of Texas,
near White Rock Lake

TROT is a non-proﬁt organization start.
ed in 1984 by Diana Ulery, a physical ther-
apist with the Visiting Nurses Association
who says miracles happen when you put
kids and horses together.

“Young children oﬂen ﬁnd therapy in a

clinical environment too routine," Ulery
_ said, “but put those children on a horse and
there is a reason behind the work Sudden-
ly, a child who can’t walk unaided becomes
as mobile as anyone else. The walking gait
of the horse more closely imitates the walk
ofahumanthan any machine.” ’

Eight— year-old Johnny Moore was riding
for the ﬁrst time. “I just wish I could [ride]
longer," he said.

 

 

Donavon Hampton of Rowlett was the ”

old pro in the quartet Now 5, he’s been
with TROT since he was 2. His father, Dao
vid Hampton, says horseback riding has
helped his son a great deal.

“He has much greater control of his head '

and trunk,” Hamptoh said. “Riding also
seems to help him relax mare and he’ s be-
ginning to verballze more. He used to tight-
en up so in the shoulders that he couldn't
talk. Now his therapist thinks that in two

. years he'll talk just like everyone e

Beth Quarfoot of Richardson enrolled
her daughter, Lisa, 11, in the program for
two reasons. “I loved riding when I was a
kid and thought Lisa might like it, too,”
she said. “And, it will be good therapy for

'her.‘ A friend who told me about TROT

TROT has a waiting list of more than 60'
children. It operates solely on tax free do- ‘
nations and volunteers. Riding lessons are .
free to disabled students of all ages. Its

pational therapist Kathy Splinter, will add
a Thursday-night class this summer.

“We started in 1984 with four students.

A pet

for lonely
latchkey

children?

You hate for them to
be alone, but -— like the
parents of 10 million
children under the age
of 14 — you must work
and leave your children
at home unsupervised
after school. If you’d
like for them to have a
companion and you’ve
never thought of get-
ting a dog or cat,
there’s new evidence
that pets might be the
answer to keeping
latchkey kids company.

The Pets Are Won-
derful Council is offer-
ing an information kit
to help you and your
children learn how a
pet can help make the
hours spent until you
get home less frighten-
ing and even fun.

Compiled with the
help of Lynette Long, a
Child psychologist and
author of a handbook
for latchkey children,
the packet includes a
coloring book for chil-
dren introducing them
to Buddy and Betsy, a
dog and cat that show
how much fun a pet can
be. The coloring book
and a poster also in-
clude safety tips for
children left alone.

A pamphlet, A Par-
ents ’ Guide for La tch-
key Children and 0th-
ers on Their Own,
guides parents through
the feelings of fear and
boredom many latch-
key children feel and
helps them select the
right pet.

What stunned him even more
was the indifference with which
many people treated their pets.
“Sometimes people turned in their
animals to shelters because they
were going on vacation, knowing the
animals would be put to death if no
one adOpted them," he said. “They’d '
say, ‘That’s OK. We’ll get another
one when we get back.’ ”

face on them came down in the fall. .
His yellow posters violated Cobb
County’s sign ordinance, so he re--

Undaunted by the callousness of
some pet owners, Kalina found opti-
mism in the volunteers of the Cobb
Humane Society. He met longtime
members like 20-year veteran Jean
Wright, who takes dogs from the
shelter to the Parkaire Mall from 1
to 4 pm. every Sunday to find
homes. Mrs. Wright becomes a fos-
ter owner for the unclaimed dogs
and brings them back to the mall
each week until someone adopts
them.

Kalina also encountered. Cindy

resides in a menagerie that includes

negligence causes.

The consequences are apparent
in the crowded dog pens of animal
shelters throughout the Metro Atlan-

the pile of dogs behind the Cobb

1 rain tied to lake pollution

New study fans flames for actiOn to cut sulphur dioxide

ay TOM DIEMER
PD BUREAU

WASHINGTON -- A new govern-
ment study, concluding that the‘ ‘con-
nection between acid rain and
environmental damage is real,”
fanned the flames yesterday for con-
gressional action to sharply reduce
sulphur dioxide pollution.

“If President Reagan and Congress
needed any further proof that acid
rain is man-made and pollution reduc-
tions are the cure, this National Acad-
emy of Sciences report provides it.”
the National Clean Air Coalition said.
“This finding should convince any
remaining doubting Thomases that
sulphur dioxide pollution is killing
fish, far from the point of. its origin.”

For environmentalists, timing-of
the release was exquisite.

7 Reagan is expected to back some
sort of acid rain control program
when he meets with Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney on Tuesday.
A separate Canadian American report
recommends a $5 billion program to
develop cleaner methods of burning
coal.

On Capitol Hill, where the acid rain

 

debate has been dormant for more
than a year,- two new bills were being
readied for introduction; both of them

could raise rates for Ohio’s electric

utility consumers.

Acid rain results when dirty coal is
burned and belched out of the smoke-
stacks of power plants and factories.
As recently as 1981, 1,638 metric tons
of sulphur dioxide spewed out of Ohio
stacks, more"-than any other state, a
government scientist said.

“We’ve established a very signifi-
cant linkage between sulphur emis-
sions and lake acidifications in some
regions,” said James H. Gibson, the
Colorado University scientist who
chaired the government study group.

The dispassionate, 506-page report,
billed as the “most comprehensive
effort yet” to assess acid rain damage,
was sponsored by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), the U. S.
Geological Survey and the National
Research Council. It offered no rec-
ommendations for dealing with the
problem documented in a three-year
study of 626 lakes in the northeast,
upper Midwest and Canada.

The report concluded:

0 Once-pristine lakes in the Adiron-
dack Mountains of upstate New York
are increasingly polluted by sulphur
and nitrogen deposits in the form of
rain, snow or dry particulates. Fish
populations were found to be dying off
in some of these lakes.

0 Lake pollution is not uniform; on
average, lakes in New Hampshire
showed no rise in acidity in recent
years, compared to the period

H between 1920 and 1940, and acid

levels in Wisconsin lakes actually
dropped. A number of individual lakes

”in those states became more polluted, .

however.

0 Forests are suffering in areas of

heavy acid rain concentrations, but
“no definitive evidence” was found
linking their condition to sulphur diox-
ide fallout.

The sulphur content of Ohio-mined
coal was put at 3.6%, among the high-
est concentrations, but not as sulphu-

" ric as coal from western Kentucky

and Missouri, the scientists said.

Ohio factories and utilities contin-
ued to burn more coal than any other
state during the last decade, accord-
ing to the report. Ohio, Pennsylvania,

Illinois and Indiana consumed one-
third of all of the coal burned in the
country, but the increasingly industri—
alized southeast has shown the great-
est growth 1n coal use in recent years.

In Congress, the argument that acid
rain is ,“a national problem requiring
a national solution” seems to be losing
favor. Midwestern congressmen may
have missed the boat a few years back
when they failed to cut a deal for their
states on financing a pollution control
program, one environmental source
said yesterday.

A bill to be introduced next week by
Sen. Robert T. Stafford, R-Vt., could
hike the electric bills of Ohio consum-
ers by 9% or 10%, in a bid to cut
sulphur dioxide emissions in half,
nationwide, by 1991. Ohio would have
to cut its emissions by 67%, under the
bill.

Apart item the Senate measure,
Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., was
trying to round up Republican support
in the House for a bill to attack the
problem. Waxman would set up a gov-
ernment-financed loan program,
offering utilities backing to purchase
and install pollution control equip-
ment, such as scrubbers.

 

 




DETROIT FREE PRESS - March 17, 1986

Winter duck decrease p11

Wildlife officials

ByiSUSAN DeFORD
.(nighi-Ridder Newspapers

.2 ST. MARKS REFUGE, Fla. —— Winter once brought thick
fldcks of migrating ducks to the St. Marks National Wildlife
Refuge. .

:But as spring returns this year, officials at the refuge just
sopth of Tallahassee report that many of their diked ponds
drew no mallards, pintails or other species. The problem is
statewide: Ducks just aren’t coming to Florida like they once
did. ‘

fFlorida’s disappearing ducks reflect a decline that
reaches across the continent and threatens birds that serve
asathe emblem of the nation’s 400 wildlife refuges. -

FU.S. and Canadian officials are working on a long-range
strategy for the ducks’ recovery, but Florida refuge officials
say the problem is out of their hands. - .

{“There’s no lack of winter habitat,” said Red Gidden,
longtime biologist at the refuge located 20 miles south of

Tallahassee. “There’s nothing we can do if the birds don’t ‘

arrive.”

7 ACROSS North America, the past duck season Was one
of ‘the most dismal on record.

Federal officials estimated the number of ducks mi grat-
ing south last fall was 62 million, a 38 percent drop from the
early 19705, when the population reached 100 million.

' “The flight of ducks last fall was probably the smallest in
25 to 30 years,” said Bob Smith, a migratory bird adminis-
trator with the US. Fish and Wildlife Service in Washing-
ton, D.C.

. Even more severe than the national decline is the drop in
wintering ducks at the four principal waterfowl refuges in
Florida.

}At St. Marks, a mid-winter census showed an estimated
24,000 ducks, compared to more than 125,000 in 1970,
biologist Gidden said.

Farther down the gulf coast at Chassahowitzka National
Wildlife Refuge near Homosassa, the population of ducks
has fallen nearly 90 percent in 15 years, from 25,000 in 1970
to’3,000 this winter, said refuge official Jack Womble.

' AT THE REFUGE on Merritt Island near Cape Canaveral,
the last good year for ducks was 1979, when officials tallied
between 40,000 to 50,000, said refuge planner Dorn Whit;
more. This winter there were about 17,000 ducks, he said.

.Farther south in Palm Beach County’s Loxahatchee
National Wildlife Refuge, the number of wintering ducks
has fallen from nearly 33,000 in 1975 to about 12,400 in
1985, said refuge biologist Joyce Kleen.

eLocal hunters, she said, “think there’s a problem with the
refuge. They don’t know about the whole picture.”

:Wildlife officials aren’t sure, but they say there may be
several reasons why the duck decline on Florida’s refuges is
greater than the national trend.

7 For one thing, the state’s watery landscape offers ducks
more areas to winter than can be found in other, drier
regions where refuges play a key role.

Figures from an annual Florida duck survey in non-
refuge areas show swings in population, but no clear decline
over the last 15 years. State wildlife officials caution that

 

 

they question the reliability of their own counting proce-
dures.

Ducks also may be cutting their long trek short, stopping
to winter at suitable spots north of Florida. As an example,
St. Marks officials point out that still-plentiful Canada geese
no longer visit the refuge, settling instead at refuges farther
north.

BUT MOST officials agree the principal reason for
Florida’s dwindling ducks lies far north, in the broad
prairies of the Dakotas, Montana, Minnesota and southern
Canada.

There, the ducks’ prime nesting grounds — numerous,
scattered ponds called potholes and native prairie grass-
lands —- are being obliterated.

Potholes, carved out by glaciers millions of years ago, ‘
dry up in drought and are drained for cropland in one of the
world’s prime wheat-producing regions. And in the last
decade, one-third of the region’s remaining grasslands was
converted to cropland, according to a Canadian-American
study. -

Those factors contributed to a duck-breeding population
last summer of about 31 million, the lowest in more than 30
years of surveys, federal officials reported.

Last summer, as drought took its toll on the diminished
nesting population, federal officials imposed new restric-
tions for the winter hunting season. The season was
shortened from 50 to 40 days, and stricter limits were set on
the number of birds taken. Those actions drew fire from
hunting groups. .

“I’m for giving hunters as much opportunity as we can
without a detrimental impact to the resource,” said Michael
Berger with Ducks Unlimited Inc., a conservation group
dominated by hunting advocates. '

. Ducks Unlimited, which annually raises millions of
dollars to improve duck habitat, supports goals set by-

Canadian and American authorities to buy or protect

millions of acres of land in key breeding and wintering
grounds.

However, it would fight efforts to keep more restrictive
hunting regulations in place this fall, Berger said.

Somerville’s dog catcher.
shatters the stereotype

A dog may be man's best friend, but in Somerville
it is a woman named Judy Lavender who is a dog’s
best friend.

For the past two years Lavender, 40, has been
serving as Somerville’s animal control officer, and
she has toppled every stereotype that has ever exist-
ed of the diabolically scowling dogcatcher scooping
up stray dogs in his net and tossing them, howling,
into his van. never to be seen again. ,

Lavender. who holds a degree in psychology from.
Clark University in Worcester, is a dog catcher with
a heart so compassionate that she has used her own
money to advertise in local newspapers for adoptive
homes for the strays she finds on the streets of Som- ‘
erville.

 

Though the future of a dog who isn’t claimed by
its owner in 10 days can be chancy in some pounds, 3
stray dogs picked up by Lavender are very lucky‘
dogs, indeed.

Of the 200 or so strays she has found, she has had
to have only two put to sleep — one had a chronic
illness and the other was a chronic biter. She’s found
homes for all the others and always makes follow~up
checks on the placements. On April 5, the Somerville
Animal Welfare Association, of which Lavender is
cofounder, will'hold a benefit dance to raise funds for
spaying and neutering animals. .

Somerville police and city officials praise Laven-
der’s work. "Each day Judy goes over and above her
responsibilities and makes sure that any animal she
picks up finds a home. She even takes them home
with her and has paid for newspaper ads herself,
without the city being aware of it,” said Grace

Abruzzio, administrative aide to the mayor of Somer- '

ville and Lavender’s boss.

Lavender also uses money she earns at part-time
jobs ~- she currently works nights sitting with the
mentally ill — to board dogs for longer periods, when

necessary. "
.The second job also helps supple-

ment her $15,000-a-year salary as
animal control officer. Weekends,
her regular days off. she spends
arranging adoptions between fam—
ilies and dogs. While officially not
on » call 24 hours, she is often
called at home by police when
there is a dog or other animal
emergency. ‘

A slightly built woman who
looks younger than her years,
Lavender calls herself “the black
sheep of my. family.” Her father,
Joseph Lavender, recently retired
after 30 years with the Connecti—
cut Department of Education. Her
mother, Dr. Beverly Lavender, is a

. Connecticut school psychologist,

and a sister. Joan, is a graduate
student.
Attired in a khaki shirt and

slacks and seated in her office, a
1 .

wmdowless room that was once
used as a Civil Defense storeroom
inside the Somerville Department
of Public Works building, Laven-
der talked about her job and love
of animals.

“I’ve always loved dogs, she
said,"‘but we lived in the Bronx
when l was small so I couldn’t get
a dog until we moved to Connecti—
cut when I was 11.” After college,
she went to work for the Commu-
nity Renewal Team in Hartford

’9

and later at a welfare office in

Mattapan. Then, for five years,
she ran a used-furniture shop in
Cambridge and most recently held
a job as a secretary and word pro-

cessor at the Widener Library at.

Harvard.

“My father is a bit apprehen—
sive about this job because he
thinks it runs' my life, and it
does," she said. “It actually broke,
up my relationship with my boy—
friend after seven years.”

Lavender says. "Owning an ani-
mal is a very heavy responsibility.

Lavender’s day usually starts
at 8:30 am. When she checks her
answering machine for messages
and arranges the tasks they re-
quire according to priorities. Dog.
bites get high priority and the of—
fending dog has to be quarantined,
at his home for at least 10 days.’
Then she goes to the police station
to pick up her two—way radio and
prepare citations for violations,
such as unleashed and unlicensed
dogs, barking dogs and com-
plaints against owners for cruelty.

Not everyone should own a pet,

People should remember that dogs
don’t have human mentality to,
handle themselves in a mecha-
nized world. When a dog is outside
without a leash he is at the mercy
of other dogs, traffic, dog thieves
or animal dealers, or he could be a
menace to people and other ani-
mals," she said.

Karger, protected by his leather glove, holds a sprawling golden eagle.

Falconer lives

By MARY FLOOD
Post Reporter

He’s got eagles on his arms,
hawks in his home and falcons
in his dreams.

The birdman of San Antonio
—- John A. Karger — is a 33-
year-old burly, bearded man
with a mass of blond curls who
has devoted his life to the pres-
ervation of birds of prey.

At the Texas Renaissance

Festival he plays the role of The
King’s Falconer with relish and
aplomb. He looks on it as a dra—
matic way to educate human
beings to the value of his fierce-
looking ﬂying friends.

Karger has abandoned the 9-
to-5 routine of a conventional job
and carved out a career as a
rehabilitator of needy birds —
particularly birds of prey.

He has joined with others in
forming Last Chance Forever

'I dream of flying:

life on the wing

Inc., which collects about 100
sick or orphaned hawks, owls,
eagles and vultures a year. They
feed the birds small animals and
vitamins, exercise them and
nurse them back to health so
they can be released into the
wild.

In the meantime, some of
them go on the road with
Karger. They soar and swoop

Falconer lives life on the wing

Continued from page 1A

" magnificently over awed audi-
ences at renaissance festivals in
three states.

“I try to enlighten people to
the beauty of a creature that
does not speak our language,”
said Karger, an earthy man who
has some very definite ideas
about the way things should be.

“Humans think they are the
No. 1 animal and they don’t
have to worry about others. But
they should think about who will
go next if eagles, hawks and fal-
cons disappear,” he said. ,

To Karger the endangered
i species list — which includes.
some of the birds in his flock —
. is meaningless. He thinks all
' birds and all animals are endan-
- gered because man is carelessly
' pouring toxic waste into the
ground, water and atmosphere.

. He is currently nursing a

' golden eagle that went blind af-

ter convulsions Karger is con-

vinced were caused by toxic

‘ waste deposited in the bird’s fat
tissue.

' But he warns that birds of

prey also are placed in peril by

;, the myths of man. He said it is

; in ignorance that some believe

y} all hawks are “chicken hawks”

‘, because an occasional bird will

7 swoop out of the sky and kill a
penned chicken.

‘ There is no such thing as a

chicken hawk, he said. There

" are no eagles that pick up small

‘. children or Volkwagens, he
" stressed. And pigeons and chick-I
, ens aren’t stupid, which he

proves by using them in clever

little skits in his show.

He doesn’t dress up his birds,
make them ride bicycles or have
them talk.

“My birds eat birds that
talk,” he said.

Karger doesn’t want people to
believe that they can housetrain
a hawk any more than they can
tame a tiger. He wants people
to know that a mother eagle
drops food to her young because
they develop sharp beaks and
strong claws and are not to be
coddled and cooed over.

“I don’t kiss my birds be-
cause they could rip my lips off.
I don’t name the birds. I don’t
love them. I respect them and I
honor them. And I think they
respect me,” he said.

Karger. believes his current
lifestyle is his destiny. Some-
times he wakes up at night and
drives across town to the barn
where he keeps the birds —
about 35 right now ——- because he
gets an uneasy sense something
is wrong. It.frequently turns out
that one of the birds needs the
attention of a veterinarian.

“When I’m working with
them intently the bird and my-
self are very much the same
thing. I dream of ﬂying. It be-
comes a natural hallucination,”
he said.

“A good falconer must be
able to walk with his back to the
bird and know when it is flying
toward him without seeing it or
hearing it,” said Karger, who
believes much can be learned
from a species that can commu-
nicate across 10 miles of sky.

His profession chose him

when at age 9 someone left five
barn owls on his family’s door-
step, he said. He took the birds
to a nearby veterinarian, who
was able to save three of them.
He was hooked.

He studied the ancient art of
falconry in high school. And

though he worked toward a reg-

ular job as a registered animal
technician, he eventually quit
the job and took up the cause.

He has worked .4: the Texas
festival for nine years. His 6-
year-old corporation runs on in-
dividual donations of about
$40,000 a year and donated ser-
vices such as freezer space, vet-
erinarian work and the special
leather gloves he wears.

‘ Karger assumes he will never
have personal wealth but that
he will always have birds that
need help, some for broken
wings and some because people
foolishly tried to domesticate
them.

He is especially proud that a
19-year-old man who first saw
Karger’s show nine years ago
recently brought his wife and
new child to see the power and
beauty of Karger’s birds.

Karger loves the children who
come to the show and usually
helps one pet an eagle at each
show. “The children and the
birds are both so innocent until
we pollute them,” he said.

Appearing in costume on a
horse attired in splendid red,
Karger is scheduled to do five
shows each Saturday and Sun-
day at the festival near Magno-
lia, which runs every weekend
through Nov. 10.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - NOV. 1, 1985

How Bats Are Threatened By People

By Patricia Corrigan
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

A conservation organi-
zation has built a gate in a
cave on the Current River
in Shannon County where
bats hibernate during the
winter months. The 10-
foot-high, 65-foot-long
gate is not designed to
keep the bats in the cave;
it was built to keep people
out.

The 13-acre cave,
which has a 30-foot-high
ceiling, is believed to be
the largest hibernaculum
(winter resting place) in
Missouri, and it may be
the largest in the Mid-
west. The bats gather in
the cave in October and
settle in for a long win-
ter’s nap. If undisturbed,
most of the bats will sleep
until April.

Sometimes, however,
people canoeing 0n the
river stop and go into the
cave, and some people
may disturb or even try to
harm the bats. The tiny
animals use up energy
protecting themselves
from the intruders, and
the bats need that energy
in order to hibernate six
months. A loss of their
winter fat reserve may
cause the bats to wake up
too early in the spring,
and they may starve if

they can’t find any food.

Nobody would ever dis.
turb a hibernating bear,
at least not on purpose,
but a lot of people have
the wrong idea abox
bats.

For instance, .many peo-
ple think that all bats
probably have rabies.
That isn’t true. Less than
half of one percent of all
bats contract rabies, and
even those sick bats rare-
ly behave aggressively or
spread the disease. Of
course, a sick bat will bite
in self-defense.

Bats, like bears, are
mammals. There are
nearly a thousand kinds
of bats, and (they repre-
sent about one-fourth of
all animal species. They
are secretive and move
about mostly at night.
They are not dirty, nor
are they blind. Bats use
sophisticated ultrasonic
signals for navigation and
communication. Accord-
ing to the United States
Fish and Wildlife Service,
bats are often misunder-
stood, feared and even
killed. '

People who harm or kill ‘

bats are breaking a law.
The Endangered Species
Protection Act states that
pe0ple who kill or disturb
endangered bats or harm
their habitat may have to

pay stiff fines or go to

prison.

The Fish and Wildlife
Service is working with
other federal, state and
private agencies, such as
the Nature Conservancy,
to try to protect bats. The
service has published
“Bats and Their Conser-
vation,“ a pamphlet
about bats and their
habits.

“Most bats are harm-

less and beneficial, but
their numbers are declin-
ing rapidly, ” it says in the
pamphlet. “Several spe-
cies of bats are already
extinct. Others might

soon become extinct if ..

(misunderstandings
about the bats) are not
corrected. "

In the United States,
the gray bat, the big-
eared bat and the Indiana
bat are endangered. All
three species are declin-
ing because people dis-

 

 

turb and harm them. In
the last 20 years, the pop-
ulation of gray bats has
declined by 80 percent.
Only two dozen small col-
onies of big-cared bats
are known to be surviv-
ing. The number of Indi-
ana bats is declining be-
cause of pollution of
streams over which they
feed and a loss of their
native forests along
waterways.

Some bats eat fruit;
some eat nectar. Both

kinds of bats ensure fu-
ture crops of such plants
as peaches, bananas,
mangoes, avocados,
dates, cashews, figs, car-
ob and cloves. Many trees
and shrubs depend on
bats for pollination.

Bat guano (droppings) is
an important source of
fertilizer. In the south-
western part of our coun-
try, 100,000 tons of bat
guano was mined from a
single cave. Guano is
used in ‘many countries
as fertilizer on a number
of crops, including nearly
a third of the world sup-
ply of black and white
pepper.

Scientists who study
bats have used them to
develop navigational aids
for the blind and as vac-
cines to test drugs and
study aging processes.

Bats also eat insects.
One gray bat may eat up
to 3,000 insects, includ-
ing mosquitoes, in a sin-
gle night. A colony of 20
million free-tailed bats in
Bracken Cave in Texas
eats up to a quarter of a
million pounds of insects
nightly. However, when
the insects are contami-
nated by overuse of agri-
cultural pesticides, the
bats die.

You can help the bats
survive by telling your
family and friends not to
be afraid of the animals,
but to help protect them.

 




The shy", harmless bat ised by

EW YORK (UPI) —— A sci-
I \ I entist who draws blood
from bats, in a fine tum-
around on the Dracula myths, says

the furry, night-ﬂying mammals
have gotten a bad name.

“They really are the least dan-
gerous animals around,” said
Gary McCracken, an associate
professor of zoology at the Univer-
sity of Tennessee who has studied
millions of bats. The only time
bats try to hurt McCracken is
when he takes samples of their
blood with a hypodermic needle.

He takes blood from bats?
“Yeah, I call it a variation on
an old theme,” he says.

Of the 800 species of bats, only
three are vampires that feed by
drawing blood from animals. All
three species are located in the
tropical regions of Central Ameri-
ca, and they were discovered long
after the legend of Dracula, who
turned into a vampire bat to suck
the blood of humans, was en-
trenched in the lore of Eastern Eu-
rope.

Which means the Europeans
had fathomed an animal they
could never have known existed in
the real world.

“It’s a real mystery how it hap-
pened,” says Merlin P. Tuttle,
president of Bat Conservation
International, a group that pro.
motes the welfare of bats. “Drink-
ing of blood is part of ancient be-
liefs that go back to the Greeks.
DraCula was a real (15th-century)
Romanian Prince who was known
as The Impaler.”

But since those times, bats have

been associated with all that is
scary and evil.

“We’re frightened by bats be—
cause we don’t understand them,”
says Tuttle. “They’re shy and ac-
tive at night, so we see them only
in glimpses. It’s truly unfair be-
cause they are portrayed to the
public in the most unﬂattering
light.”

Almost all bats feed on insects,
which ought to make them more
p0pular. .

“I’m surprised there are any in-
sects left in the state of Texas,”
says McCracken, who has studied
Texas caves housing 2 million
bats, a group capable of eating a
quarter-million pounds of insects
in one night.

Vampire bats are the exception,
he says. The three Central Ameri-
can species feed on deer and other
wild mammals at night, although
the introduction of dogs, cattle and
horses to their native habitat has

added a new source of food.

John Hlebica and Tim Zaun rope two burros in a government roundup in Death Valley, Calif.

Burros snared in desertroundup

By RONALD B. TAYLOR
, Los Angeles Times

DEATH VALLEY NATION-
AL MONUMENT, Calif. ——
Charging wildly across the rugged
desert on horseback, hard-riding
wranglers are lassoing the last of
the Death Valley wild burros and
dragging them into captivity.

Assisted by a helicopter, the
ropers have captured more than
4,000 burros in two years and ex-
pect to round up the final 2,000 by
winter’s end, concluding a $1.2
million effort to rid the monu-
ment of the cute but pesky descen-
dants of North African jackasses.

The burros range from Eagle
Borax Spring, 280 feet below sea
level, to the top of 11,000 foot
Telescope Peak. Rangers expect
that a few will escape capture by
hiding in the most remote, forbid-
ding recesses of the 2-million-acre
monument.

The job is made doubly tough
because, unlike cattle or horses,
burros refuse to be herded. Riding
tough desert mustangs captured in
the wild and trained especially for
this work, four young cowboys
and their taciturn boss wrangler,
Gene N unn, must rope the burros
one at a time.

On a recent blustery day, the

crew was working in far-off Hid-
den Valley. A cold wind was
blowing as helicopter pilot Del-
bert Lawson, 59, took off with

.,-_.,‘ ,v x-

h

_ .xx. (:3 . x, w: ,, .,
A,f_l¥‘ KIA-1‘" ‘ I ~ ' L

Nunn riding scout. They flew high.
up into the canyons and near the
peaks, searching out springs
where the burros water. They
sighted six burros, and the work
began.

Using horns, sirens and the
pop-popping turbulence of the ro-
tor blades, the pilot drove the
fuzzy, black burros out of a gulch
and down the mountain into flats
where the wranglers waited on
their horses, ropes ready.

“It’s hard to catch them if
they’re running downhill, so when
they get close, the pilot’s got to
turn them, head them up for us,”
explained John Hlebica, 23, a
cowboy from Northern California

who recenlty signed on with Nunn '

for $8 an hour, a high wage for
cowboys.

A walkie-talkie tied to the back
of Hlebica’s saddle squawked out
a warning: “They’re comin’ your
way.”

Out of sight in an arroyo, the
cowboys waited until the burros
popped up over the ridge and
dropped down into the arroyo.
The chase was on. Running at
breakneck speed, dodging spiny
Joshua trees and rocks, lunging
up steep banks and down into
gulches, the wranglers whirled
and threw their ropes, each trying
to lasso a burro by the neck.

l

It is dangerous work. Only the i.

day before, Paul Valdon’s horse

f,

was galloping when it stepped into
a burrow, stumbled and fell, roll-
ing over the young cowboy. Nei—
ther the rider nor the horse was
injured and both were quickly up
and contint‘nng the chase.

On this day, a hard-riding Phil
Zamora, 42, had just got his rope
on a big burro when the beast
ducked around one side of a tree.
Zamora’s horse ran around the
other side, hanging up the rope in
the tree. Before Zamora could let
go, the rope was jerked from the
saddle horn, burning a painful
welt across his hand.

The burro, free again, but with
Zamora’s rope trailing behind,
was roped a second time by Tim
Zaun, 28, a snuff-dipping Wyo-
ming cowboy. Zaun got the burro
stopped and he and Zamora threw
it to the ground, fashioned a rope
bridle and then dragged it two
miles to a corral.

The big roundup of Death Val-
ley burros has not been without
controversy. Some burros caught
last year were put up for adOp—
tion, others were auctioned to
buyers who agreed not to harm or
kill them. But several truckloads
were shipped to an Oreg n
slaughterhouse. Embarrassed f d-
eral officials acknowledge th
many as 700 burros may
been killed in violation of th _:
agreements.

Bunch of baloney

JACKSON —— I would like to respond to the
letter which appeared in the paper on Nov. 12,
1985, regarding the shooting incident at Reed
Manor. This incident has nothing to do with
walking to Bell Tower or taking a walk
outside. It could have happened anywhere. I have
lived at Reed Manor about 10 years and I like
it very much. We do not feel we are imprisoned
in our apartments. That’s a bunch of baloney.

I see these people take the bus, or take a walk all
the time. I think the fear is generated when
someone puts an article in the paper (such as the
letter) and the people read it.

The sooner the shooting incident at Reed
Manor is dropped, the better it will be.

' SLETTER

 

VOLUME19 NUMBER 7

AUGUST 1987

 

lection and After

ACIt‘ President responds to some memb, questions

by the Hon. Hal Wootten, Q.C.

What Happened?

No party has had such an
environmentally reckless policy as the
Howard Liberal Party. The policy
allowed Sir Joh to mine Fraser and
Moreton Islands, Shelburne Bay, and
any other coast or islands, and
continue the destruction of the Wet
Tropics. It allowed Mr Gray to dam the
Franklin and log and pulp the
Lemonthyme and Southern Forests
and national estate areas. It handed
Uluru and Kakadu to the Northern
Territory. It contemplated the export
of native birds.

. These are all issues on which Labor
had infinitely better policies, with a
record of action. On many other
issues Labor was unsatisfactory, but
the Liberals were as bad or worse.
The Democrats' environment policies
were uniformly good, the Nationals'
non-existent.

What did ACF do?

In February Phillip Toyne called on
all parties to consider their policies
and sought interviews with leaders.
Mr Hawke saw him three times and .
offered positive actions. Mr Howard
refused three requests. Mr Downer,
the Shadow Minister, said that the
conservation vote was of no
importance to his party and offered

-_no comfort on policies.

When the election was called, ACF
pressed all parties for their policies.
An embargoed copy of the
unreleased Liberal policy was
obtained from Mr Downer and a
summary circulated to Councillors;

4H ’ {a/{ﬂ/ /////”. /' 5

’Z//
I

amazingly he later accused ACF of
bias in making a decision without
waiting for the Liberal policy.

Phillip presented for postal vote of
Council, options ranging from doing
nothing through to endorsement of
parties or candidates. His
recommendation, which I supported,
was for vigorous publicising and
discussion of policies without
endorsing any party. It was
overwhelmingly rejected in favour of
supporting Labor in the lower House
and Democrats in the Senate.

The person responsible for the
Council's decision was Mr Howard.
On the day of the vote, he delivered
his 'tax' policy, announcing the
'abolition' of the Department of the
Environment, the 'abolition’ of the
National Parks Service (except in the
territories), and the ’abolition' of the
ACF grant. For Councillors already
aghast at his decision not to proceed

with the nomination of the Wet Tropics
for World Heritage without
Queensland Government consent, the
'tax' policy was the last straw.

Mr Downer's response was .
McCarthyist: ACF had been hijacked
by left—wing activists with a hidden
political agenda. His evidence was its
nuclear policy - which had been in
place for over a decade - and its
criticism of the Liberal pledge to
abolish the Foreign Investment
Review Board. He seemed unaware
that since Mr Fraser's day the Board
has had to consider the environmental
effect of foreign investment.

Mr Downer's attack received wide
publiCity. At an election meeting in
Sydney I had the opportunity to give
the lie to his allegations to his face.
As i have been unanimously elected
President by the last two Councils,

Forest Campaign Has
Significant Election Effect

by Jane Elix, ACF NSW Campaign
Officer

The Australian Conservation
Foundation and The Wilderness
SOciety cooperated in a successful
attempt to influence Australians to
'Vote for the Forests'. Their joint
decision to advocate voting for the
ALP in the House of Representatives
and the Democrats in the Senate was
made on the basis of past
environmental record and existing
policy statements on the environment.

The campaign tactics included ,
distributing leaflets, organising public
meetings, an extensive media
campaign, the production of
educational material and handing out
'How to Vote' cards on election day.

Over 1,500 volunteers helped and
they are to be congratulated and
thanked. They should be pleased with-
the impact their activities had on the
final election result.

Geoff Lambert, Secretary of the

NSW Wilderness Society, has made a
detailed analysis of the election
results in the eleven marginal House
of Representatives seats which were
chosen for intensive campaigning.

His results point out that in the face
of a 1.3% swing against the ALP, the
Government will in fact gain at least
two seats. He claims that this is a
direct result of the 'Vote for the
Forests' campaign. The four seats
picked up (Denison, Forde, Fisher
and Petrie) were all 'Forests' seats;
the two seats lost (Chisholm and
Lowe) were not.

The swing in the eleven 'Vote for the

Forests' seats was 0.89% to the ALP,

compared with a 1.31% swing away
from the ALP Australia wide. The
'Forests' vote therefore contributed

an average 2.2% of the ALP vote in
these seats. For 'Forests' seats held
or won by less than these critical
margins (Dunkley, Denison, Phillip,
Barton, Forde, Petrie and Fisher), the
'Forests' vote was essential to an ALP
victory.

The 'How to Vote' cards distributed
on polling day were deliberately
printed so that, although favouring the
ALP, they recommended a slightly
different voting order. The 'Vote for
the Forests' campaign scrutineered
for those votes in Barton, Phillip,
Casey, Dunkley and Makin. On
average, 12.5% of the ALP vote
followed the 'Forests' tickets instead
of the ALP ticket, with Barton in NSW
showing a spectacularly high (over
20%) vote for the forests.

Geoff Lambert concludes his
analysis by noting that the ALP now
has irrefutable proof that it can win
votes by adopting pro-conservation
policies, a fact acknowledged in
writing by the Prime Minister following
the election. Even more encouraging
has been the recognition of the
conservation vote by both John
Howard and Robin Gray. Hopefully
this will result in much sounder
environment policies from the
conservative parties.

 

The Election And After

Continued from page 1

changes in ACF - changes not in
policy but in management, profile and
activity - I did not take kindly to his
attack, nor to his attempts to belittle
our Director.

ACF's stand was the same as many
conservation bodies, including TWS,
WLPSQ, R080 and NCC of NSW,
whose President, Dr Judy Messer,
said that Mr Howard seemed to have
declared war on the Australian
environment.

Does ACF automatically support the
Labor Party?

Emphatically no. The decision was
made on the policies and records of
the parties. Mr Howard, in his pursuit
of New Right ideology, pushed up "the

stakes. They were higher than in 1983:

not only the Franklin, but Fraser and ~
Moreton Islands, Shelburne Bay, the
Tasmanian forests and Wet Tropics.

ls ACF satisfied with Labor policy?

Again, emphatically no. It barely
scratches the surface of a good
environmental policy. It was the
Liberal alternative which made Labor
look good.

 
  

  
   

FOR THE
FORESTS

Should ACF endorse political parties?

This question needs debate away
from the pressures of immediate
decision. ACF must influence political
actions; how can we best do this?
Campaigning generates enthusiasm -
we gained far more members than we
lost. But actual party endorsement is
divisive and may narrow our base. it
brings all the problems of single isue
politics. Do we need to do it? If we
do, can we find ways to ease the
strains - we already segregate
election expenses so that people do
not contribute involuntarily. I hope to
raise the issues in a future edition of
Habitat and invite discussion.

 

How are election expenses paid?
ACF does not use membership fees
or donations which are given for

general purposes by members and
sympathisers who may object to their
use to support a political party.
Similarly it does not use government
grants or tax—deductible donations. lt
established a special election fund
and invited donations which are not
tax-deductible. To the extent that
donations fell short, profits from the
sale of merchandise were used.

Where now?

The wide gap in seats hides a
narrow vote. We must ensure over the
next three years that such a situation
never arises again. The immediate
tasks include:

. keep Labor up to its promises and
improve its policies;

- work for a new approach by the
Opposition, build links with the rural
community and seek as much bi-
partisanship as possible;

- develop an intellectual response to
the New Right;

. build on the public support evident
in the election, widening it to
encompass a sustainable and
respectful attitude to the whole
envrronment.

ACF Newsletter August 1987

 

by Basil Schur, ACF Forests
Campaigns Officer, WA

In what is the most positive WA
forest news in years, the Burke
Government has turned down a
proposal to establish a new export
woodchip industry on the South Coast
of Western Australia. This decision is
a landmark victory for the
conservation movement in WA, which
has campaigned for two years against
the proposal.

On 29th June 1987 the WA Minister
for Conservation and Land
Management and Environment, Barry
Hodge, announced that the McLeans
woodchipping proposal would not
proceed. He also released details of
the Environment Protection Authority
(EPA) assessment which found the
project to be environmentally
unacceptable.

Mr Hodge said that a study
commissioned by the EPA found that
the area of remnant native forest on
private land was significantly less than
estimated in the McLean ERMP/EIS.
Therefore if the project proceeded a
much greater proportion of the
privately owned native‘forest would be
removed. Mr Hodge said this was
environmentally unacceptable.

Because of the reduced availability
of resource from private property,
McLeans proposed to seek access to
material from State Forest. The State
Government would not supply
additional timber from State Forest for
the project, the Minister said.

The Australian Conservation
Foundation congratulated the Premier
of WA, Brian Burke, for what it
believes is a decision of national
conservation significance.

The Government's decision will
prevent the large scale land
degradation and disruption to local
communities that the McLean project
would have caused. The
Environmental Protection Authority's
assessment of the proposal reflects
the views of the majority of South
Coast residents. The local tourist
industry can now be assured of a
healthy future, free from the road
hazards and landscape disfiguration
that the project would have generated.
The Government's decision will be in

the best interests of the farming
community. Many farms in the region
already have land degradation and
salt problems from overclearing.
There are several existing tree
planting schemes available to farmers
who want to establish plantations on
cleared land.

Farmland native forest near Denmark, WA saved from McLean's proposed woodchip industry.

The WA Government's decision
should give great inspiration and a
boost to morale to all those groups
and individuals in five states who are
endeavouring to protect our native
forest heritage from the export
woodchipping menace.

 

New ACF Branch in the Illawarra

by Jane Elix, ACF Campaign Officer, NSW

ACF has recently established a new branch in
the lilawarra region of southern NSW covering
postcode regions 2500-2534. The branch
members will be meeting in Wollongong on the
fourth Tuesday of each month at the lilawarra
Environment Centre, 157 Crown Street,
Wollongong.

Meetings have been held in May and June. At
the May meeting, ACF President Hal Wootten
spoke on the new and expanded roles for ACF
branches, both in terms of promoting ACF‘s
national policies at a local level and also bringing
important local issues to national attention.

The June meeting involved a lively discussion
of local issues, particularly concern about the
lilawarra Escarpment. The meeting passed a
resolution to support the proposal of the National
Parks Association in lilawarra to have the Crown
land strip known as Caloola Pass declared an
extension of Macquarie Pass National Park. The
proposal is to join Macquarie Pass National Park

to Budderoo National Park via Caloola Pass.
Both conservation groups believe the
preservation of the wildlife corridor is essential
and that the historical and scenic value of the
area should be retained. The area is currently
under threat from proposals that a road be built
through it.

The meeting also decided to prepare a
submission on thezoning of land at Mt Keira from
environmentally protected to residential.

A speaker from the Department of Environment
and Planning has been invited to put the
Department's position on the Escarpment to the
July meeting.

The August meeting will be a 'Wilderness night'
with a video and speakers from the Wilderness
Society. The Branch has also invited ACF
Director Phillip Toyne to speak at a meeting in
the near future.

For further information on branch
activities contact Branch Secretary Cheryl
Aldrich. Her work telephone number is

Bend Beer
Dispute
Continues

by Marcus Beresford, SA
Conservation Council and Cathy
Smith, ACF Resources, Industry &
Employment Project Officer

Bond Brewing has been sending a

‘ circular to all those who wrote to

criticise the company for mounting a
challenge to South Australia's
container deposit legislation (see
March Newsletter).

- The company claims to be a good
corporate citizen, despite court
convictions of Bond subsidiaries for
environmental damage.

- The company advises
correspondents that they 'are being
inveigled into a political plot' and
suggests that its agreement with the
SA Labor Government was
undermined by the Liberals and
Democrats for purely political
reasons. in fact the SA Government
was bullied into making an initial
agreement when faced with the
prospect of a damages payout if Bond
Brewing won its case in court. The
Opposition refused to accept this and
overturned the Government’s
compromise.

- Bond Brewing suggests that the
deposit legislation was introduced
only to benefit the SA Brewing
Company. In fact, the national brewer
Carlton United Breweries (Foster's
Lager) has managed to compete
successfully in SA (capturing up to
25% of the market). '
. Bond Brewing insinuates that it has
played a positive role in relation to
bottle recycling in NSW. in reality its
subsidiary, Tooheys, withdrew from a
voluntary re-using scheme and
replaced reusable with 'one—trip'
containers.

 

Don't be sweet talked by Bond

HOW YOU CAN HELP

 

 

by Denise Bond, ACF
Wet Tropics Campaign Officer

The need for a full land use study
for Queensland's Cape York is
becoming desperate as further
developments are planned for the
region. As there has been no overall
management plan to facilitate a
balance of development and
protection of the ecological and
wilderness values of Cape York,
conservationists have little choice at
present but to react to each
development as it occurs.

A prime example is the proposal to
establish a commercial space launch
base in an area between Weipa and
Port Musgrave, stretching nearly to
the East Coast near Shelburne Bay
and the Olive River region. The
selected area covers some 10,000
square kilometres (see map).

In Part One of a feasibility study on
the space port, the institution of
Engineers-Australia recommends that
an environmental impact assessment
should be undertaken once a '
particular location for the launch
facilities has been chosen. in
management terms, however, it makes
far more sense to consider the
location of the space port in the
context of an overall management plan
for the Cape, that is, to assess the
impact of the environment before
choosing a site.

The space port and associated
infrastructure could threaten Cape
York's survival as a largely
undeveloped, natural area,
unsurpassed for its size and variety of
ecosystems. it is likely that the
Peninsular Development Road would
be upgraded to service the space
port, thus opening the Cape as far as
Port Musgrave to afar higher volume
of people and other developmental
pressures. ,

Some of the particularly
environmentally important areas within
the recommended region are:

- the lower reaches of the Wenlock
River and wetlands of Port Musgrave
area which are important for waterfowl
and as breeding sites for saltwater
crocodiles;

- the Mapoon Plains which are of
significance to local Aboriginal

people and are environmentally

stands of rainforest on the Great
Dividing Range south of Messum Hill.

There are several Aboriginal
Reserves in the recommended region
between Weipa and Port Musgrave.
Most of the Aboriginal communities
were forcibly evicted during the early
days of Weipa; the Old Mapoon
People from the mouth of the
Wenlock River were relocated to the
Bamaga complex in that 9603.
Aboriginal groups are also calling for
a full land use study of Cape York.

The second part of a feasibility
study on the financial viability of the
space base should be delivered to the
Queensland Cabinet this month. A
prospectus will then be circulated
Internationally, calling for expressions
of interest - the media has already
reported interest from a number of
countries. As yet, there has been no
call for public comment on the
proposal.

The Commonwealth Government is

Officer, The Wilderness Society

Just over a year after Mr Hawke's
promise to protect Tasmania's
' National Estate forests, the
Lemonthyme and Southern Forests
Commission of inquiry held its first
public hearing.

The Inquiry was set up by a
Commonwealth Act of Parliament
passed earlier this year. The Act gives
the three-member Commission the
powers of a Royal Commission. The
legislation also bans forestry
operations in Lemonthyme and the
Southern Forests until June next year.

Only days before the inquiry
hearing, the Commonwealth took the
Tasmanian Government and timber
industry to the High Court, seeking an
injunction to stop illegal roadworks in
Lemonthyme and the Picton Valley
near Farmhouse Creek. The court
case was postponed until mid~August
when the Tasmanian Government
promised to halt the bulldozers and
Chainsaws until the case is heard.

The first hearing of the Inquiry went
ahead without the forestry companies

and State Government. They refused
to participate until the legal challenge
to the Inquiry legislation has been
resolved.

Two major issues confront the
Inquiry:
- whether there are any areas of, or

ACF Newsletter August 1907

Tasmanian Forests
Inquiry Commences

‘ contributing to, World Heritage value

within Lemonthyme and the Southern
Forests, and

. whether there are alternatives to
logging Tasmania's National Estate '
forests without loss of jobs and
timber production.

The Australian Conservation
Foundation, together with the
Tasmanian Conservation Trust and r
Wilderness Society, is preparing a
submission to the Inquiry.

The conservation movement will
argue that Lemonthyme and the
Southern Forests, with their great tall
eucalypts (the tallest flowering plants
in the world), cool temperate
rainforests, ancient native pines,
delicate alpine vegetation, exquisite
caves, soaring peaks and fascinating
archaeological sites, are indeed of
World Heritage quality.

A streng case for not logging any of
Tasmania's National Estate forests will
be put to the Inquiry. Research by
ACF and other groups shows that
both National Estate forests and jobs
in the Tasmanian forestry industry can
be protected by better management
of other forests.

 

Environmental Studies Fights for its Life

by Bob Burton, ACF Councillor,
Tasmania

The Centre for Environmental
Studies has been targeted for
abolition by conservative academics at
the University of Tasmania.

The Centre was established in 1974
as a postgraduate Centre to study
environmental issues from a range of
academic disciplines. Over the last 13
years the Centre has published large
numbers of papers on topics
including recycling, energy policy,
forestry policy, land use planning and
wildlife conservation.

Many conservative academics were
annoyed by the Centre's research into
politically contentious areas such as
energy policy in Tasmania and have,
over the years, launched many
challenges to the independence and
staffing of the Centre. All such
previous moves were defeated.

The tragic death in early 1986 of the

founding Director of the Centre, Dr
Dick Jones, presented the
conservative academics with the
political opening they sought. A
Review Panel was appointed to report
on the future of the Centre. The Panel
included Dr Bruce Davis (Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Chairman of the
Australian Heritage Commission),
Professor Frank Larkins (Chemistry),
Professor Hughes (Education) and
Professor Clark (Bio-medical
Science).

The Review Panel criticised the past
performance of the Centre and
recommended that it be amalgamated
with the Department of Geography,
despite the opposition of this
Department to such a move. The
recommendations of the Review Panel
sparked a furore.

The students and staff of the Centre
strongly oppose the amalgamation
and have campaigned vigorously to
retain the Centre's

independence. Support has come

from local councils, Liberal and Labor
candidates for the federal seat of
Denison, the state ALP, the .
Democrats, and many academics from
around the world. The Hobart
newspaper, The Mercury, has been
deluged with letters to the editor and
has editorially supported the retention
of the Centre.

On 14th August the University
Council will decide whether to
approve the amalgamation of the
Centre with the Geography
Department, but whatever happens
the struggle for Environmental
Studies will continue. The
conservative academics will not give
up if the amalgamation proceeds, but
see it as the first nail in the coffin of
Environmental Studies at the
University of Tasmania. The book-
burners are alive and weil, it seems.

Bendigo Salinity
Conference Report

 

by Katy Sher, ACF Soil Conservation
Project Officer

Mahatma Gandhi may have used salt
to gain nationhood for India, but
salinity is proving a major threat to
many parts of our nation. Contrary to
what you may hear in some quarters,
ACF is not just on about logging,
Kakadu and rainforests. With the
formation of the Land Management
Committee, ACF is presently
upgrading its efforts in this sphere to
greater levels.

For example, let me put you in the
picture about ACF and salinity in
Victoria. in February this year, the
Victorian State Government released
its Salt Action document which
outlined in draft the Government’s
proposed farm of action for
combatting the problem of salinised
lands and rivers in Victoria. On 22 and
23 May a community salinity
conference was held in Bendigo in
order to provide a forum for people
within the community to put forward
any criticism of the document.

Nine days prior to the Conference
ACF was asked to provide a speaker
to discuss the strategy, giving an
environmental perspective.

The Conference attracted about 300
people, the majority being from
Government departments, with
relatively few farmers or other parties
seemingly involved. This was a direct
result of the lack of publicity the
conference was given prior to its
commencement and the fact that it was
held during one of the farming
communities' busiest periods.

Keynote speakers on the fourth day
were: the Hon. Evan Walker; Mrs
Heather‘Mitchell, the President of the
Victorian Farmers Federation; Cr Pam
Robinson from the Shire of Violet
Town and Bill Hare, ACF Deputy
Director.

in his speech, Bill acknowledged
that the strategy attempted to achieve
environmental stability through the
proposed action programmes.
However, ACF was greatly concerned
with numerous aspects within the
strategy.

in brief, there seems to be little clear
commitment by the Victorian
Government to develop salt disposal
and interception works. This means

that the State Government is faced
with the option of not pursuing a
technical approach to salt disposal
works, like that of the Federal
Government. A possibility exists for
the State Government to adopt an
approach that holds careful and
mandatory consideration of the
environmental effects of future salt
disposal works.

The document needs to give a clear
commitment that environmental .
effects upon wetlands will be carefully
evaluated and acted upon. ACF
believes that use of wetlands for salt
disposal/evaporation basins should
be forbidden in the future.

ACF supported the proposed
revegetation program outlined in the
strategy but would prefer to see
native vegetation planted, not pine
trees.

The Foundation felt that the strategy
largely ignored the involvement of the
wider community in the decision
making process. The strategy seemed
directed towards the farming
community, with the community
involvement process proposed sadly
lacking in allowing those outside local
council areas a chance to voice their
opinions and concerns.

Although Government members
were busy patting each other on the
back agreeing that the strategy was a

Seminar on
Water Research

The Australian Water Research Advisory
Council will conduct a two day seminar on water
research in Canberra on 17th to 18th
September 1987. The Council, formed in
1985, provides advice to the Government on
achieving a balanced national effort in water
research. Its recommendations have led to
funds being provided ($3.4m in 1986/87) for
research projects and fellowships, industry
research associations and research centres.

The purpose of the seminar is to assist the ’
Council to formulate advice on the priorities to
be accorded nationally to research on all
aspects of the supply and use of water. Papers
to be presented at the seminar will cover
research into the management of water
resources, both generally and in relation to
particular sectors of the industry.

Further information and documents may be
obtained from Australian Convention and Travel
Services Pty Ltd, GPO Box 2200, Canberra.

Vlctorlan Alps: World
Herltage Or N atlonalDls . race?

by Bill Hare, ACF Deputy Director

If you go for a walk from Mount
Bogong across the high plains to
Mount Feathertop today you are in for
a nasty surprise. You will see a lot
more than you bargained for.

Logging, grazing, roads, hydro-
electric schemes and intrusive tourist
developments will mar the vista. Yet
this area is described as one of the
State's most outstanding and
spectacular natural areas, noted for its
diverse plants and animals,
breathtaking scenery and great variety
of recreation opportunities.

The area has been praised as being
of World Heritage significance
because of its botanical and
zoological features. There are hints
that the Victorian government would
consider World Heritage nomination,
an act that it perceives could enhance
a tarnished environmental image. Yet
the area continues to be managed in a
way that seems to reflect more a
concern for the preservation of short-
term interests than for the
conservation of the unique values that
could make it a World Heritage site.

The Minister for Conservation,
Forests and Lands released a
planning proposal for the Alpine area
in June, which is merely a collection of
the ideas and practices which have led
directly to the current parlous state of
Victoria's Alpine area. The document
shows only token appreciation of the
urgent need to change use and
managment of the area. The planning
proposals are fundamentally flawed,
as vital information is omitted.

Lack of Integration

The proposals fail to integrate
surrounding land use and ownership
with the Alpine area. Only lip service
is paid to the need for management of
surrounding areas to be in sympathy
with the management of the sensitive
Alpine region, and with the
management zones that apply to the
Kosciusko National Park across the
New South Wales border. For
example, Alpine resorts are not
integrated, nor are State Forests
surrounding the Alpine area.

Also, the proposals do not include
appropriate maps to make clear the
land tenure (State Forest, National
Park, other crown land and private

  

VIew from Mt Feathertop of once only logging in Bogong National Park. Photo: Bill Hare

land) or the proposed zonings within
the designated area. Basic ecological
information is not included, hence
anyone seriously interested in
examining the management proposals
in a conservation context would have
to refer to numerous other sources.

This lack of integration is quite
curious, as one of the stated
objectives for developing a combined
CF&L Department was to ensure that
land management was integrated, not
fragmented. The lack of integration
seems to help exploitative and
destructive activities.

The continued logging of the Alpine
ash forests, particularly at high
altitude, constitutes one of the
clearest examples of such behavior.
The Alpine ash forests are an integral
part of the Alpine ecology. The
ecological gradients from forested
lowlands to Alpine herbfields are also
critical , and constitute one unique
feature which made the area World
Heritage quality. But the planning
proposals allow for continued once-
over logging of most of these forests,
despite evidence that this may lead to
irreversible damage. Similarly, the
proposal to allow grazing over 95% of
the Alpine region illustrates the clear
commitment to exploitative attitudes
within the Department.

Back to Front Planning

Planning of an area should begin
with an investigation of zoning
options for different types of
management. Zones should be set up
to define areas for management, such
as: special protection, wilderness,
conservation. Having defined these
areas, it is then appropriate to
consider the nature and extent of
activities that would be allowed,

consistent with the objectives of each
type of zone and within the areas
designated for the particular zones.

The Alpine area planning document
tackles the problem back to front.
Without defining zones on maps, the
document discusses the uses and
activities allowed within particular
areas. This means that proposals are
made for four wheel drive access,
horse access, grazing, hunting and
logging without any debate on what
areas should be wilderness areas,
strict conservation zones etc.

The planning proposals should be
withdrawn and reissued with options
for the zoning of the Alpine region,
rather than with options for
maintaining particular uses within the
planning area.

    

The proposals have been released
for public comment until 31st August.
After comments have been received
by the Department of Conservation,
Forests and Lands, submissions will
be considered during preparation of
the detailed management plans.
These plans will be released, as draft
management plans for further public
comment.

Appropriate conservation objectives
have to be built into the Alpine
planning system at the earliest
possible stage. The basic planning
principles are currently not consistent
with conservation. Your submission
or letter to the Department's planning
project team will influence the
management plan and final outcome.
You can contact the ACF or the
Conservation Council of Victoria
(Chris Mitchell) for further information
to prepare your comments or letter.

by Bruce Dover, Convenor, Forest
Action Group Seminar Committee

The Forest Action Group in Sydney
has established a committee to
organise a one-day seminar to explore
alternatives to native rainforest timber
use. This committee has been
meeting sinCe January 1987 to
develop a suitable program and to
find contributors who are both
conservationists and have a
substantial knowledge of the topics to
be covered.

The object of the seminar is to
contribute to the preservation of the
world's rapidly diminishing rainforests
by reducing the demand for rainforest
timbers. Seminars of this kind have
been undertaken in Great Britain and
Europe with considerable success.
The Forest Action Group hopes that
this seminar will be a step towards
changing oonsumers' attitudes
towards timber goods. The necessity
to prevent national and global

rainforest destruction will be
highlighted and the scar sic and
practical feasibility of us. .9 only non-
rainforest or plantation-grown timbers
and, where appropriate, non-timber
materials, will be explored as one way
of decreasing current demands on
rainforests for consumer products.

The seminar will be attended by
representatives from furniture
manufacturing, importing, building
and professional associations,

CSIRO, academia, the Public Service, 1

conservation and many other
organisations. The general public are
also invited to attend.

The seminar is set for Saturday,
September 5th, in the Merewether
Theatre at the University of Sydney. It
wiil immence at 9.15 am and will
finish at 4.30 pm.

Among the speakers who have
alre” " , agreed to participate are Hal
Wet... a (President of ACF), Neville

Wrar. {'fon‘ner Premier of NSW), Murray

Wilcox (former President of ACF),

Seminar to Reduce
Rainforest Timber Demand

John Seed, Peter Hale and Bob Ryan.
Other speakers with specialist
knowledge in building, architecture,
furniture, silviculture and other topic
areas will also be contributing.

A small exhibition will be an
important feature of the seminar.
Furniture companies have agreed to
display quality timber furniture made
from non-rainforest timbers such as
Tasmanian Oak, Danish Beech and
pine. The display will also include
timber samples and non-timber
products. Information sheets will also
be available.

Keep September 5th free to attend
the seminar. Please inform your
friends and colleagues. People with
an interest in the timber-based
industries, home renovating and
decorating and helping to save the
world's rainforests would find the
seminar interesting.

The Australian Consumers
Association recently released their
report on food irradiation. Their
inquiry looked into the safety and
necessity of introducing this process
into Australia, and is available for $15
from the Australian Consumers
Association, 57 Carrington Street,
Marrickville, NSW, 2204.

ACF presently opposes the
introduction of food irradiation on the
grounds that more research is needed
into the health and environmental
effects, and that it has not been
proven to be necessary.

Groups have been working on this
issue all around Australia, and at the
time of going to press, Peter Milton is
chairing an Environment and

Update on

Conservation Standing Committee
Inquiry which will report at the end of
the year. Comments should be sent to
the Committee, C/- Parliament House

Lettersto the Editor

Mining Industry
Overkill on Ads

from Ted Trainer, University of NSW

Congratulations to Hendrik Pruul and
S.H. Allen for targetting the growth
economy as the basic problem for anyone
concerned about the environment. An
economy growing at a mere 3% pa. by
2050 will then be generating eight times
as much annual output and
environmental impact. Recent statements
indicate that in the next 20 years we will
probably lose the richest rainforest areas
and one million plant and animal species.
How many will be left in 2050 if the Mr
Keatings of this world get us on the path
to 5% p. a. growth, which would mean 32
times the 1987 annual output in 2050?

There is rapidly increasing recognition
that most of the big global problems are
closely linked as consequences of the
growth and greed society. I thought
conservationists might be interested in the
accompanying graphs which show how
the pursuit of economic growth totally fails
to solve the massive problems of
underdevelopment and poverty. World
wealth, and Third World wealth, have
increased greatly, but over the eight year
period graphed the richest 1/5 in the
world got 67 times as much of the
increase as the poorest 1/5.

Market forces, the profit motive and the
growth imperative ensure that economic
activity focuses on the rich few. Thus
these factors directly generate the
appalling maldistribution of wealth that
now accounts for 43,000 child deaths

New Internationalist, Feb 1980, p5.

This doesn't mean that the alternative
has to be big-state socialism. To achieve
a just, peaceful and sustainable world
order we must shift to much more simple,
decentralised and self-sufficient regional
economies in which there is no concern
with affluence and growth.

'Growth Economy'
Our Basic Problem

from James Bayliss, Chairman,
Creswick Concerned Citizens
Committee, PO Box 63, Creswick,
Victoria, 3363

The Cres wick Concerned Citizens
Committee, currently campaigning to have
rights of landowners protected under the
Mines Act, are frustrated at the saturation
style advertising of the Mining Industry,
currently promoting the virtues of gold
mining, in both the printed and electronic
media. They extol the virtues of gold
mining and state it is to the advantage of
all Australians.

There are large numbers of citizens
throughout Victoria disadvantaged to the
extreme by the current 'Mining Boom',
particularly by the fact that under the
present Mines Act 1958 they have
virtually no rights at all in respect to their
properties, lifestyle and quality of life.
Presently, miners may take out licences
quite legally to over-run private property,
destroying what could be in many cases
not only a lifetime of saving, work and
effort in the development of their
properties, but the potential future of their
children. The Miners talk of
'compensation', (which is far from
adequate), but how do you compensate a
family's shattered dreams and future?

Presently very large areas of Creswick
and Victoria are being 'pegged' by Mining
Companies, including crown land as well
as private property. These areas, if
allowed to fall victim to the 'gold fever', will
inevitably die, and Local Councils
granting Permits to miners will, in fact, be
signing the death warrants for many
small towns such as Creswick.

Our Committee is not against mining.
However, we feel it should not take place
in residential areas, sensitive natural and
regenerated areas, tourist industry
developments etc., and should be subject
to the same rules and regulations as any

other business enterprise. Private
landowners must be given the option to
say yes or no to mining on their property,
and our Committee is determined in its
aim to lobby the Government to amend
the Mines Act 1958, when the State
Government review takes place later this
year, to give all Australians equal rights,
both landholders and miners. We must
all fight this iniquitous situation. We
cannot allow an Act of Parliament to
disenfranchise one section of our
community. That is not the Australian
way. Let us bring back the Australian
tradition of a 'fair go '.

We cannot hope to match the obviously
well financed advertising campaign of the
Mining Industry, but would like to hear
from all Victorians who feel they are, or
are about to become, victims of this
abhorrent Mines Act.

People Power Will
Reach the ‘Unconverted

from Nancy Moyser, Hon. Sec., Sydney
ACF Branch

l have just re-read John Reid's letter in
the June issue and agree with all he says.

Nothing wrong with providing films,
talks, slide-nights etc. for the converted,
but we are not reaching the unconverted,
unknowing masses. The people either
don’t know we exist, or believe we, and
the environment, are nothing to do with
them. We are a cosy club for the middle-
class middle-aged.

Phillip Toyne made a good speech at
the Sydney Branch AGM last month, and
one point has stuck in my mind. He said
"Conservation is about life ".

So it is, so everybody should be in it.

We must convince people that the
environment is where they live, it belongs
to us all, i.e., ALL species.

This will take time, effort, money, space.
We must have access from us to the
people, and from the people to us. There
must be a space where we can display to

advantage our goods for sale, and
provide space for people to linger and
learn, with stacks of information on what
we are about, and why everybody is
involved. With people power we have a
chance of winning, but it will take a long
time, so we should start now.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - NOV. 7, 1985

Pit-Bull Raid Stirs Up Dogﬁght

By Jan Paul
and Marjorie Mandel
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

The manner in which investigators
of the Humane Society of Missouri
seized evidence in raiding a farm near
Lebanon, M0,, where pit-bull terriers
are bred, is being investigated by the
Laclede County’s sheriff.

Jack Miller, the county’s prosecut-
ing attorney, said he had requested
the inquiry after learning that James
Brown, an investigator for the Hu-
mane Society, had returned to St. Lou-
is with “a sack of documents” along
with the 12 pit-bull terriers found at
the farm.

Miller refused to issue a felony war-
rant against the dog breeder, Jacob
Wilder, and ordered the dogs re-
leased. They were returned to Wilder
on Monday.

Brown said the Humane Society was
not dropping its investigation of
Wilder. _ '

The raid took place Wednesday af-
ter the Humane Society and sheriff’s
department got a search warrant.

Miller said he had too little evi-
dence to charge Wilder with training
the dogs for the purpose of fighting.
He said that although the documents
in question were considered “tainted"

from a legal point of view, the situa-
tion had no bearing on his decision
against issuing warrants. '

The Humane Society’s Brown said
an assistant county prosecutor had
gone aldng on the raid. “He knew
what we found and said he’d file
charges,” Brown said.

Miller said he wanted to determine
whether any laws had been broken
when Brown took the evidence out of
Laclede County without the knowl-
edge of Sheriff Lawrence M.
Rifenburg.

“You just don’t go to a potential
crime scene, take a sack of documents
and take them out of the county with-
out establishing a chain of evidence,”
Miller said.

But Brown said Miller was “full of
hot air. We make raids all over the
state, and this is how we handle it.”

Miller said he had phoned Brown on
Friday and threatened to issue a war-
rant for Brown’s arrest unless the doc-
uments were returned to Laclede
County by Saturday. Miller got them
the next day.

Brown said he had taken the docu-
ments with the approval of the assis-
tant prosecutor. “We needed the docu-
ments for our report,” he said.

Miller said he believed the raid

 

“was a fishing expedition.” He said
the Humane Society had led Laclede
County authorities to believe that
vending machines and an arena
would be found on the property, which
could be considered evidence that
dogs were being fought there.

“There wasn’t anything like that,”
he said.

Brown denied any such misstate-
ments. He and David Barthel, another

Humane Society investigator, said ;
they had found evidence that they 5

believed showed the dogs were being
trained for fighting.

The evidence included breaking
sticks, which are used to pry apart
fighting dogs, and collar clips, which
are wires inserted in collars to irritate
dogs’ skin. Also found were hanging
tires, which are used to strengthen the
dogs’ jaws by forcing them to latch
onto the tires as they are raised and
lowered.

Barthel said the pit-bull terrier was
an offshoot of the American Stafford—
shire terrier. It is generally used for
fighting, which is illegal, he said.

Wilder, 86, said in a telephone inter—
view last week that he had bred pit-
bull terriers since 1912. But he said he
trained them as guard dogs, not as
fighters. He said he'sold the dogs for
$250 to $2,000.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - NOV. 8, 1985

People «I Wharf Miss a
III-Sized Pal

1

By J. L. Pimsleur

People along Fisher-
man’s Wharf are trying to re-
place Jack Park’s dog, Bru-
tus, a mission of mercy that'
may be impossible.

Brutus, killed in an attack by
another dog a few days ago, was a
little Pomeranian who wore mir-
rored sunglasses, strutted, talked
and generally endeared himself
‘to the sightseers, shopkeepers
and street vendors on the Wharf.

The tiny globe of golden fur
looked like a baby fox from the
front and a hair ball with legs
from the rear. He weighed about
five pounds.

 

But. to his owner, Jaikun
(Jack) Park, he was more than a
pet, he was a partner. He was, in
fact, Park’s primary source of in-
come.

Brutus used to perch atop
corner garbage cans and newspa-
per racks on the Wharf, cooly
surveying passers-by from be-
hind his trendy Ray-Bans.

Tourists found him irresist-
ible. They loved the way he
posed, cocky and street smart in
his sunglasses and black T-shirt
with the words “Super Stud”
printed on the back. -

 

Brutus was so adorable that
people would have their pictures
snapped with him.'For the privi-
lege, Brutus would cadge a buck

BRUTUS THE POMERANIAN
He was more than a pet

or two that went into a little
wooden box.

_ “This sucks, but I need the
bucks,” read a hand-lettered sign.

“The two of them were in-
separable,” said Marta Galindo, a
street caricaturist who worked
the same Mason street corner as
Jack and Brutus.

“I would often hear Jack
talking with Brutus, discussing
the events of the day. They al-
ways ate together. No dog food
for Brutus. Whatever Jack ate,
Brutus ate. They’d sit down on
the curb by Boudin’s Bakery and
share their lunch —- a pizza, a hot
dog, maybe a little crab or some
shrimp.

“He was just crazy about that
little dog,” said Galindo, “and
Brutus loved Jack. The dog really

responded to people. If you'

talked to him, he would talk back
with a little high-pitched yelp.”

When Jack Park showed up
at the Wharf last week it was
obvious something was wrong.
He shuffled silently along Jeffer-
son street, his head down. Brutus

Dog Soup e an Fails to Deter
South Korean Restaurants l

 

Seoul

When you take away a dog-
gie bag from some restaurants
in Seoul it means just that --
there is dog in the bag. ‘ '

The South Korean government
ruled last year that dog soup restau-
rants should be shutdown to pres-
ent a better image for foreigners as
the 1988 Seoul Olympics approach,
but the establishments still flourish.

After closing for a few months,
the restaurants have reopened to
meet public demand.

Now they usually have no signs
outside and have. moved from main
streets to back alleys. out of the way
of most foreign tourists.

A visit to one such restaurant at
lunch time found the place packed

with businessmen and office work-
ers.

The menu offered one meal: a

large boiling pot of dog ribs "served
with sesame leaves and seeds. fol~
lowed by plain boiled rice washed
down with soju, a potent, colorless
liquor [made from potatoes.

‘- Opponents of the government’s
ruling argue that Koreans have eat-
en dog for hundreds of years and
should be allowed to continue.

When the ban was first an-
nounced last year, newspapers 0p-
posed the restriction and some Koo
reans accused the authorities of

bending to pressure from animal~

lovers overseas. a

They also pointed out that most
Koreans did not eat dog and that
the practice was not widespread.

The owner of one dog soup res-
taurant admitted she did not like to
eat her own fare and only did so
when asked by customers.

She declined to comment on

reports that some dogs are beaten
before they are killed to make the
meat tender.

“it tastes just like beef,” is the
comment of intrepid foreigners

who overcome their qualms and try
the dish.

‘fDog has been eaten in China,
the Philippines, Indonesia and 0th
er Asian countries for centuries,”
says one Seoul resident. “i don‘t
know what all the fuss is about."

He swears by the recuperative
qualities of the food, which he con-
siders a delicacy.

Arena of dust

Tribesmen pit dogs, bear in primal contest

‘By JOHN. wmress

Arizona Republic Staff
t one end of a natural amphitheater in
a dry riverbed on the outskirts of the
frontier city of Quetta, Pakistan, a
black bear is chained to a stake driven deep
into the soil.

At the other end, about 200 feet away, two
white dogs —— they look like bulldogs —— are
tethered to stakes. Aroused by the sight and
scent of the bear, the dogs set up a continuous
haying, straining at the ropes that bind them.

Squatting in a circle about 30 feet from the
bear is a crowd of townsfolk: Tall, swarthy
Pathans intermingling with Mongol Hazara in
the pale, dusty, late-afternoon sunlight.

This is the setting for hill-country enter-
tainment in this remotecorner of the world,

"time, the bear is tiring. It takes him
a few seconds longer to wrestle the
.dogs to the earth.

Again the dogs are pulled away

and again loosed on the bear. The
animal, panting heavily, wrestles
them underneath him. But this
time, he cannot keep them pinned.
They wriggle free and grip him in
the skin behind the ears, tumbling
him over backward.

The bear yelps in distress. The
crowd, until now silent, lets out a
cheer. The bear, it becomes clear, is
the villain in this struggle.

Two men drag the dogs away.
The fight is ended.

Neither bear nor dogs have shed
any blood. The bear has no teeth.
The dogs can’t penetrate the bear’s
thick coat and tough hide.

The crowd drifts away, satisfied
with the medieval spectacle it has
witnessed.

Later, on the outskirts of Quetta,
I talk to the bear’s owner. Dust-
coated children cluster about us as
we talk.

“The dog people pay us 100 to
200 rupees (about $6 to $12) for two
or three fights,” a trainer'says.

He says the bears need no
coaching.

“We don’t need to teach them to
fight. They know how to fight
themselves.”

The trainer says he and his fellow
owners are “Ankhi people” from
the region of Dera Ismail Khan.
They are a nomadic people, shorter
and darker than the Pathans,
Baluchis and others of this area.
Bear training is a longstanding
tradition with them, they say.

Spot. Lord Young’s is Muffy.
Michael Jopling’s are Tamar

Thatcher doesn’t have one at

Neither does Kenneth Baker,
but it is he, as environment
secretary, who has the task of
persuading his cabinet col-
leagues that they must ﬁnally
come to grips with one of the

country’s biggest bones of

' contention - what his own
department has called Britain’s
“dog problem”.

Successive cabinets have
doggedly refused to deal with
the anomaly of a tax, the dog
licence fee, which actually costs
the taxpayer more than £2.5m a
year. For the past eight years,
the cost of collecting the 37p —
which has stayed the same since
1878 when it was the equivalent
to two days’ wages — has
outstripped its revenue. In 1983-
84 the amount raised was under
£lm but the cost was £3.4m and
evasion is such that fewer than
half of the country’s 6m dogs
are licensed.

William Waldegrave, the

should be abolished. He argues
that any attempt to raise the
licence fee would merely encour-
age evasion. Now Baker is
understood to have decided that
the time has come to end what
his department describes as
“the current absurdity”.

Patrick Jenkin, his prede-
cessor and the owner of a
labrador retriever-cross, took a
close interest in the subject and
proposed that the national tax
should be replaced by a fee set
locally by councils up to a
(naturally) capped maximum of
£10 or £15.

Such ideas ran into oppo-

ports abolition altogether, say-
ing that a fee penalises the
responsible owner. On the other
hand, the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals (RSPCA) wants a higher
national fee, of about £5, rather
than varying local charges. It
strongly opposes total abolition,
saying it would be a “tragedy”
which would only increase the
“horrendous" problems of stray
dogs. Police deal with 250,000
of these a year, but the

mates that there may be as

Stop Duplicate Tests, Save Money

Editor:

A way to save billions of tax
dollars, according to the head of
the Interagency Regulatory Liai-
son Group, Washington, DC,
would be to require government
agencies to stop duplicating tests
in laboratories. In addition to
saving money, this could reduce
the totally unnecessary suffering
of laboratory animals, used in
painful tests which already have
been performed in other labs.

A letter just received from
Congressman John McCain de-
scribes HR 1145, the Information
Dissemination and Research Ac-
countability Act, which would pro-
mote dissemination of biomedical
research to prevent duplication of
experiments on live animals. It
would also establish a National
Center for Research AccOuntabil-
ity. Federal agencies would have to
submit proposals, to this clearing-

house.

The liaison group head stated,
"If a single test, done with a given
procedure, would satisfy all of the
agencies’ requirements, there
would be signiﬁcant saving. It may
reach billions of dollars.”

Persons interested in humane
treatment of animals -— as well as
saving billions of tax dollars —-
could write to their legislators to
urge support of HR 1145.

In addition, I note that Sen.
Barry Goldwater is one of the
co-sponsors of another bill, S 1233,
introduced by Sen. Bob Dole. This
bill would prevent needless suffer-

ing, neglect and abuse of labora-

tory animals. Rep. George Brown
has introduced a similar bill in the
House, HR 2653, which is now
before the Agriculture Committee.

more controls on dogs argues
that, since dogs munch through
£375m of manufactured food a
year, or 621,000 tons (much of it
subsequently deposited in parks
and on pavements), most owners
could well afford to pay more.

An aide at the environment
department says that, given that
there is amagreed problem with
no agreed sohﬁions, “Baker‘s
gut instinct is that the simplest
and cleanest thing to do would
be to scrap the licence fee.
Enough is enough. Let’s just get
rid of the damned thing."

Whether the dogless environ-
ment ministers will convince the
cabinet, in the run-up to a
general election with votes to be
lost by the wrong decision, is a
moot — or mutt - point.

Only about a third of the
cabinet are dog owners and
could be presumed to have a
vested interest. The most senior
are Lord Whitelaw, master of a

Muskrat chomps away

Fur buyer has bad news
about prices for trappers
stringing steel in Ohio

Clarksburg fur buyer Marvin Mal-
low has bad news for the thousands of
trappers who are preparing to string
steel in the Buckeye State’s creeks,
streams and marshes.

“Prices are at rock bottom on some
items,” the veteran fur buyer said, “and
I’m not sure they’re going to improve.”

The past several years have not been
particularly good ones for Ohio trap-
pers, and there are indications the state
is slipping as one of the leading fur pro-
ducers. _

Historically, Ohio has been second
only to Louisiana in the fur trade. How-
ever, that may no longer be true.

In recent years there has been a de-
cline in the number of trappers in Ohio.
Prices have been generally depressed
and there has been a shortage of fur in
many regions of the state.

In 1978-1979, a record 39,454 Ohio
trappers received their best pay checks
ever -— $11,295,040. In 1983-1984, the

last season for which the state has re-
"cords, 21,307 trappers were paid
$4,094,217.

Muskrat population suffers

Muskrats, Ohio’s most abundant fur
bearer, have suffered because of poor
.water conditions. “If the water dries up
the rats can’t make it,” Mallow said.

lands biologist Karl Bednarik reported

 

' a significant drop in the number of 1i-

During the 1982-1983 season, 28,275
trappers took 301,953 muskrats in Ohio
valued at $806,215, an average of $2.67
per pelt. In 1983-1984, the 21,307 trap-
pers took 229,123 muskrats worth
$724,029, or $3.16 per pelt.

Bednarik said the 1983-1984 musk?

rat harvest was the lowest in Ohio dat-
ing to 1933- 1934, when the Wildlife Di-
vision began keeping fur records.

The wildlife biologist said the aver-
age annual harvest of muskrats for the
10-year period (1973-1974 to 1982-
1983) was 560,584 pelts. Comparing
the 10-year average to last year, musk-
rats were down 59 percent. ‘

“They’re all over the place,” he said.

The red fox, third in terms of num-

LOS ANGELES TIMES - NOV. 9, 1985

 

U.S. Fines City of Hope
for Animal Treatment

By ERIC MALNIC, Times Staff Writer

The City of Hope has been fined
$11,000 for failing to comply with
federal standards governing the
treatment of animals used in lab-
oratory research, officials at the
prestigious medical facility in Du-
arte reported Friday. .

Three months ago, the National
Institutes of Health, responding to
evidence found by an animal rights
group during a break-in last De-
cember, launched an investigation
of possible animal mistreatment at
the center and froze several million
dollars a year in federal funds.

A preliminary probe requested
by the NIH turned up “at least 10
major deficiencies and 13 minor
deficiencies” in the way research
animals were being cared for at the
facility, according to the health
agency's deputy director, Charles
MacKay.

Violations Cited

In a letter mailed last week—but
not made public until Friday—the

-' US. Department of Agriculture,

which sets the standards for animal
care at research facilities and
which joined in the investigation at
the City of Hope, imposed the fine
after finding that the facility had
violated provisions of the Animal
Welfare Act.

The violations reportedly in—
cluded failure to establish adequate
veterinary care, failure to consult a
veterinarian regarding the use of
anesthetic and analgesic drugs,
failure to keep adequate records,

failure to maintain sanitary condi- ‘

tions in surgical areas and failure to

provide adequate shelter for some

dogs and cats used in research.
Eleven months ago, members of

the secret Animal Liberation Front
scaled a fence outside the research
facility, stealing‘36 dogs, 12 cats, 12
rabbits, 28 mice and 18 rats and
leaving spray-painted slogans on
the walls and floors.

In the days that followed, repre-
sentatives of a Washington-based
organization, People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, reported
that the raiders had found that the
animals at the laboratory were
being kept in “filthy, inhumane,
immoral conditions.”

In its initial investigation last
August, the National Institutes of
Health complained that it had
“found no adequate response” to
the group’s allegations.

The NIH Ordered a full-scale
investigation and announced that it
was freezing “several million dol-
lars” used for animal research, out
of the approximately $5 million the
City of Hope receives annually in
US. Public Health Service funds.

Veterinarian Hired

City of Hope officials said Friday
that the center has hired a
full-time veterinarian and has
spent $350,000 in renovations de-
signed to bring the animal research
facility into compliance with feder-
al guidelines.

Charles Mathews, a City of Hope
spokesman, said the center expects
NIH inspectors to find that all
deficiencies have been corrected
when their follow-up inspection is

'made some time next month. Ma-

thews said he expects that the NIH
will restore all grants, including
money to cover expenses incurred
by the research facility during the
period when its federal funds were
frozen.

Associated Press

WORCESTER - Sarah can’t
ﬂy, and doctors have turned to
sophisticated medical equip-
ment to probe the 2-year-old
bald eagle's brain in a search
for solutions to her problem.

One of several birds released
in 1984 near the Quabbin Res-
ervoir in a species restoration
project, Sarah was recently
found, flightless and vulner-
able. near the shores of Lake
Erie in New York. .

In a procedure scheduled for
this week, she will be given an-
esthetics, then will be bundled
to keep her wings from stretch-
ing to their 7-foot span as she is
given a brain scan.

On Thursday. she under-
went a CAT scan, 'a three-di-
mensional X-ray usually used
for humans. The computerized
axial tomography procedure re-
vealed no injuries or abnor-
malities, according to Dr. Mi-
chael A. Davis, director of radi—
ology research at the Universi-
ty. of Massachusetts Medical
Center here. ,

Dr. Charles Sedgwick. head
of the Wildlife Clinic at Tufts
University School of Veterinary
Medicine in Grafton. told The
Worcester Telegram that if
tests show the bird was poi-

soned by a heavy metal such as
mercury. there may be a need
to examine the Lake Erie area
for pollutants that could poison
other animals.

He said he hoped Sarah's
nervous system function could
be re—established to allow the
eagle to return to the wild.

“A lot of people might say
she’s only one bird, why?"
Sedgwick said. He provided an
answer: Using the CAT scan
shows that humans “want to
extend the helping hand." he
said.

The 12-pound anesthesized
bird was strapped on an oper-
ating table for the CAT scan of
her head.

The scanner took tens of
thousands of narrow X-ray

Pets Used as therapy at veterans

.. she’s going, what her duty is.

She and other homeless hounds make
trips to the Veterans Administration
Medical Center twice a month with
members of the Big Spring Humane So-
_ ciety at the other end of their leashes.
The pet therapy program using Hu-
'mane Society animals was implemented
: in July.

“It’s an excellent program’ ’said Adri-
‘ an Bankowski, recreation therapist at the
VA.

Hospitals and nursing homes across the
nation have caught on to the treatment,
he said.

Humane Society.

“Most people have had pets in their
life; so most people are receptive to pets,”
said Banowski. “A bond between animals
and people is one of the closest we could
have.”

Bringing pets to the hospital for visits
“allows the residents to care for some-
thing,” he said.

“When we come, a lot of them seem
really happy,” said Doe about the pa-
tients. “They start telling you about a
dog they once had.

“It makes you feel so good to see them
happy, because I know they don’ t get out
much,” she said.

kept their distance, Banowski said. The
patients “really didn’t understand what
we were there for,” Doe said. “The first
couple of times they weren’t as warm as
they are now.”

While working at a nursing home in
Minneapolis, Banowski started a pet
therapy program with a house dog. Some

: residents at the home also had parakeets.

He incorporated a pet therapy program
at the Veterans Administration Hospital
in Sioux Falls, SD.

“Our ultimate goal would be like to
have some gerbils, parakeets and maybe
a house dog, if that’s possible,” Banowski
said. Because the nursing home unit is on
the sixth floor, it would be difficult to
care for the pet.

owski said. Veterans hospitals in the
southwest region, including Phoenix, Los
Angeles and Big Spring, had a recent te-
leconference on the therapy.

Banowski said those taking part in the
conference agreed that pet therapy seems
to lower patients’ blood pressure and
heart rate, and increase feelings of self-
worth and self-esteem.

One disadvantage of the therapy noted
was a sometimes negative attitude on the
part of the staff.

“People are really reluctant to
change,” Banowski said. “So, anything
new like a pet therapy program, they
just kind of wait and see.’

The most important part of a pet ther-
apy program is “cooperation with the
staff and the administration,” Banowski
said.

Banowski is asking members of the
VA. staff to bring their pets to the hospi-
tal for a day to visit with the patients.

Zoo ‘parents’ fuss over wa

By SHARON EGIEBOR
Staff Writer

There was a lot of growling, roaring,
clucking, cooing and hissing going on
Saturday at the Dallas Zoo. But most of
the noises weren’t coming from the
animals. ,

It was the second annual “Zoo Parents
Party” and all the “moms and pops,”
who have adopted animals by agreeing
to pay their feeding expenses, came out
to say hello and spend a couple of hours
with their adopted friends.

The adoptive parents, after pledging
to help preserve and protect the world’s
wildlife, each mimicked the sound of his
or her own “child.” Family members
were then treated to free nachos, pop—
corn, animal cookies, drinks and pictures.

They also received a record by Peter,
Paul and Mary entitled “Going to the
Zoo.”

“Zoo parents are very excited about
their animals,” said Chelene Moore, co-
ordinator for the Adopt-An-Animal Pro-
gram. “Their animal is very important to
them.”

 

ALEXANDRIA EVANS, 3, gets ac-
quainted with a boa constrictor.

The animals’ parents, who each re-
ceive a personalized adoption certificate,
pay between $10 and $2,000 a year to
help cover grocery bills and living ex-
penses for their favorite animal. The zoo
spends about $250,000 to feed all the ani-
mals, Moore said.

And although the animals can’t go
home with them, most people take their
parenting seriously, Moore said. Some
parents visit regularly and one woman in

 

Australia, who adopted 2 inches of a
snake last year, sent a Christmas card,
Moore said.

“We visit every other month or so and
bring friends by,” said Merrie Lezar as
she admired her 5-year-old Siberian ti-
ger, Tex.

But Tex doesn’t return her affections,
at least not outwardly. “He’s not very
sociable,” she said.

Michael Nissenbaum, who was wear-
ing a tag labeled “Pigmy hippo‘sdad,”
said he has pictures of his special friend
at home. Nissenhaum, his wife, Janet,
and their two sons, 4-year—old Nathan
and 2-year-old Aaaron, adopted the ani-
mal last April.

“He likes hippos,” Janet Nissenbaum
said of her husband. “I bought him a
ceramic one and then thought I‘d buy
him a real one for his birthday.“

About 1,000 adoptive parents w indi~
viduals, groups and corporations —— have
signed up to participate in the 2-year—old
program, Moore said, and have donated
more than $95,000.

SCIENCE-NOV. 1985

Rocky mountain acid
N EW YORK—Evidence linking
spewing smokestacks and the
acid in distant lakes has never
looked so solid.

Atmospheric chemist Mi-
chael Oppenheimer and two

 

coworkers with the Environ-
mental Defense Fund in New
York found that the acidity of
rain in Rocky Mountain states
directly rises and falls in step
with the amount of sulfur di—
oxide—a main cause of acid
rain—released from copper
smelters 600 miles distant.
Unlike the northeastern
US, where acidic pollution
arises from a complex mix of
sources, the Rocky Mountain
region derives up to 70 per—
cent of its airborne sulfur di-
oxide from copper smelters.
Oppenheimer found that
fluctuations in the economic
health of the region’s copper
industry from 1980 to 1983
produced dramatic changes
in the smelters” 502 output: a
peak in emissions in 1981, an
abrupt drop in 1982, and a
slight upturn in 1983, as
shown in the graph, right.
When he graphed the
changes in the sulfate concen-
tration of fog, snow, and rain—
water collected during the
same period at monitoring
stations throughout Arizona,
Colorado, Idaho, and Wyo—

ming, Oppenheimer found
nearly identical peaks and val-
leys.

Most of the concern about
acid rain damage in the L'.S.
has focused or. mountain
lakes in the West and North—
east, and scientists are still de-
bating whether the new ﬁnd—
ings can be applied to other
regions. But the interest in
the Rocky Mountain states is
more than academic. A new
smelter, soon to be built just
south of the U.S.-Mexico bor

der, could increase 502 emis-
sions in the region by as much
as 50 percent, says Oppenhei-
mer. Current acidity levels
there, he says, are “right at
the damage threshold.”

Zoo Atlanta celebrates opening
of renovated clinic on grounds

 

By Debbie Newby
§taﬂ Writer

 

When Valentino, an‘ African lion,
needed minor surgery this year,
lack of a fully equipped clinic at
Zoo Atlanta forced" the veterinarian
to disinfect the lion house and con-
avert it into a temporary Operating
room.

"“‘S‘uch make-shift measures
should no longer be necessary when
arenovated clinic Opens on the zoo
gnmmds Sunday. The clinic will al\
lhhifgiveterinarian Rita McManamon
thi'perform major surgery and X-
rays at the zoo in Grant Park for
the first time.

'City and county officials as well
asaoo supporters have been invited
tithe 4 pm. ceremony to celebrate
the clinic’s opening.

-}‘?,j1’he new clinic should put an
end to more than inconvenience, zoo
otfiCials say.

‘, They hope the renovated build-
ing will allow the zoo to put behind
the controversy that arose last year
when several animals in the collec.
tion became ill and had to be trans-
ported to other places for treatment
before they died. '
‘ The deaths of the animals, in-
cluding Twinkles the elephant,
prompted Mayor Andrew Young to
call for a full-scale investigation
into the care and treatment of ani-
mals at the zoo. Officials also ques-
tiOned whether being transported
for treatment had contributed to the
animals’ deaths.

._ Disclosure of the deaths eventu-
allyz‘led to the firing of the zoo vet-
erinarian and acting director.

For Dr. McManamon, a 1984
graduate of the veterinary school at
the University of California at Da-
vis, the clinic’s opening is a goal
she has worked toward since taking
the job in Atlanta in August 1984.

,, “It’s really exciting,” she said.
“Waiting has been sort of like being
poised on the edge and being ready
to jump off. We‘ve managed with
the-”help of our friends at Yerkes
. (Institute) and the University of
Georgia and Auburn.” '

Though she has tried to practice
the basics of preventive medicine,
space has been a problem, she said.
“It’s kind of been catch as catch
can as far as space is concerned.
We‘ve been using a laboratory set
up in the kitchen at the primate

knucn ”

 

 

CARING FOR ANIMALS: Dr. Rita McManamon Visits Sparkle the

[Wuav .

Though animals still may be
sent to Yerkes or a medical school
for special tests or surgery, Dr.
MCManamon will be able to per-
form major surgery on many am-
mals in the clinic’s operating room.

Animals also may be X-rayed in the
clinic, which before the renovation
had no equipment for that proce-
dure. .

In fact, zoo officials in the fall
of 1983 closed the concrete block
building, formerly used as a storage
warehouse by city maintenance
workers, after the US. Department
of Agriculture criticized record
keeping and the clinic’s physrcal

1983. an investigation team from
the American Association of Zoolog-
ical Parks and Aquariums in West
Virginia visited the zoo and recom-
mended the establishment of an on-
site clinic.

The USDA was not the only.

‘ Sue Pressman, the woman re»

sponsible for listing the Atlanta Zoo
: among the 10 worst in the nation in
Parade Magazine in February 1984,
was especially critical of health-
care practices. She has since
praised the work of Dr. Terry Ma-
ple, who was appointed zoo director
in June 1984. and Dr. McManamon
as being largely responsible for the
physical improvements of the zoo

. and its inhabitants.

The building housing the clinic
was renovated at a cost of $270,000,
paid by the city. The Atlanta Zo-
ological Society picked up the
$9,000 for design of the new clinic.

In addition to X-rays and sur-
gery, the new clinic will enable zoo
employees to isolate animals that
are ill. A bed inan outside office
will allow Dr. McManamon or a
technician, whom she plans to hire,
to sleep overnight in the clinic and
observe sick animals through a win-

Boys Who toyed with bat
face pamﬁll rabies

The parents of three boys who
swatted and; played with a rabid bat
outside Rogers Middle School were
advised by hand-delivered letter that
their children should get rabies
shots, health officials said Friday.

Family doctors will decide
whether the three will get the series
of shots, officials said.

“We are particularly concerned
because there is a very severe out-
break of rabies in dogs on the border
at Eagle Pass,” said Dr. Courand
Rothe, San Antonio Metropolitan
Health District director.

'A 10-year-old boy from neighbor-
ing Piedras Negras, Mexico, died this
year from rabies. Rothe noted.

The bat incident occurred during
lunch recess Wednesday at the mid-
dle school in the Highland Hills area
of Southeast San Antonio.

According to Principal Dorothy
Williams, three students saw a bat
fluttering toward them. One boy
swatted the winged mammal to the
ground and picked it up, passing it to
his fellow students.

“There was not any actual biting,”
she said. “The bat was probably sick
and was leaving its nesting area.”

She said teacher Robert Zaldivar
moved the students away from the
hat that appeared to be dead.

“We brought the children in,
washed their hands and washed
them again with alcohol,” Williams
said, noting Zaldivar was careful not‘
to touch the bat.

“We called the health department
and they came to the school and
picked it," she said. “It tested posi-
tive for rabies.”

The principal said she did not be-
here the boys would be getting ra-
bies shots since they were not bitten
or scratched.

“The judgment call is with the pri-
vate physician,” Rothe said.

Rothe said the virus can be found
on the animal’s skin or fur and can
be introduced to humans through

 

broken skin or the linings of nostrils,
mouth, or eyelids.

A source in the health department
said the six-shot rabies prevention
treatment can cost about $500. Shots
once given in the stomach are now
given in the arm or buttocks and are
no more painful than ordinary shots,
the source said.

Rothe said Bexar County’s 20 con-
firmed cases of animal rabies this
year is almost a 50 percent increase
over cases to this date a year ago.

Pit Bull Ordinance Would Be Unconstitutional

The proposals to pass ordinances in
Tampa and Hillsborough County to restrict
pit bulls by requiring their owners to muzzle
them and to carry a million dollars in insur-
ance are, in my opinion, ridiculous because
the ordinances would fail whenchallenged
in federal court. '

These ordinances would fail because a
person would not have fair notice'that his
act was criminal since in many cases it is
impossible for someone to be certain of the
breed of dog he is getting.

Here is an example: A pit hull was bred
to a poodle. One of the pups looks like a poo-
dle but is in fact half pit bull. The owner
gives the pup to a neighbor describing it as a
purebred poodle. A year later, another
neighbor, who knows the dog is part pit bull,
reports the new owner for not properly
registering and restraining the dog and car-
rying a million dollars in insurance.

One may argue that the new owner is not

guilty because he did not know the dog’s
true parentage. Wrong. The ordinance as
proposed is a strict liability criminal law
meaning that you don’t have to know that
you are breaking the law to be guilty. You
would be guilty of a crime for which a judge
could fine you $500 and send you to jail for
60 days. '

’If that is the kind of justice that you want
then you should work for the South Miami-
Broward County pit bull ordinances to be
enacted here.

But, remember, if you win the political
battle, the Responsible Pet Owners of Flor-
ida, a nonprofit corporation formed by local
citizens, will take the county to federal court
and not only win the case but then sue the
county for repayment of its legal fees under
federal statues as allowed when a local gov-
ernment’s law is found unconstitutional
after a challenge by its citizens.

The saddest part of this nonsensiCal
drive for a pit bull ordinance by the mass
media and other uninformed persons is that
responsible pet owners like myself want to
do even more to restrain truly dangerous
animals.

We want to pass an ordinance supported
by the American Dog Owners Association,
the American Kennel Club, and the United
Kennel Club that would place restraints on
all demonstrably dangerous dogs regardless
of breed and all animals regardless of spe-
cies.

I hope sanity will prevail and the local
taxpayers will be saved thousands of dollars
and be better protected by a constitutional
and more comprehensive ordinance.

Camden pigeons fattening
for battle’ s second round

:By Dave Allbaugh

STAFF WRITER 4 .

.. CAMDEN -— Nobody champions the upcoming second
round of this Preble County village’s pigeon-eradication
campaign more than Mayor Phenix Major.

“They carry lung disease. I gOt it (histoplasmosis) in 1983
working to clean up the pigeon mess in the town hall. I spent
a week' m the hospital,” said Major.

Even as he spoke, Camden’s unsuspecting pigeons were
fattening themselves along the roofs and eves with whole-
some corn spread by a pest exterminator.

“It’s just to get them accustomed to eating it,” said Major.
“Then in about two weeks they will go ahead and put out the
poison corn."

The spring campaign kicked off in April with the mayor
proclaiming, “I want a 100 percent mortality rate.”

Total victory remains elusive, conceded the mayor. He
said the exterminator has indicated that the new bid to
poisop pigeons out of their winter quarters should kill “65 to
85 percent of them.”

“I’ve been fighting pigeons all my life," said the 69.year-

, old mayor.

 

 

 

 

“When I was a boy' 1n Hamilton County, Ind., we would
soak corn cobs overnight in water to make them heavy,” he
said. “Then we would throw them up inthe eaves above the
haymow and knock them (pigeons) silly. They would fall
and we would make them into pigeon stew.”

In Camden early this year the mayor and other village
fathers were “thinking of having a one-day shoot-out”
aimed at the pigeons, Major said. But the idea was rejected.
Concern over careless shooters and the conviction that the
pigeons would just “go somewhere else if you shoot at
them” overruled a repeat of the 1964 Camden pigeon shoot-
out, Major said.

No concerted protest against the pigeon-poisoning cam-
paign has emerged.

But Major recalled with wry amusement the outcome of a
pigeon-trapping campaign that Camden tried on another
occasion.

“Everybody was delighted that the pigeons were not go-
ing to be killed,” he said. “Come to find out, those fellas
(trappers) were taking the pigeons to a target range. They
were turning ’em loose one by one and shooting them just
like clay pigeons.”

To Save a Deer

jg. .HE QUARRELS BE-

here is a quieter battle go-

hat receives little attention:
Namely, though it is illegal
to capture and confine a
wild animal, should one
break the law in order to
save an injured or weakened
one? Game wardens say this
s an ever-increasing prob-
m, one that not long ago
confronted the Vermont
family of Bob and Janet Ste-
ward. Mrs. Steward sent us
this report, excerpted here:
“She was a small yearling
doe. weighing only 45-50
pounds. She struggled to her
feet only to collapse a yard
away, unable to get up.
Rather than leave her there

home. With no protest from
“Betsy,” she was placed on
the ﬂoor ofthe log truck.
“We made a corral in the
basement out of ﬁrewood
and placed her in it. It was
soon evident that Betsy had
physical problems that con-
tributed to her weakened
state. Her lower jaw was
nearly l'/2 inches shorter
than the upper. Her lower
teeth ran perpendicular to
the jawbone rather than
along it. so scraping bark
and nibbling branches was
extremely diliicult. Rather
than standing up on her
hoofs with toes pointed

out almost horizontally. It
appeared as though she was
actually standing on the
base of her legs. Her hind
legs curved in, making her
appear knock—kneed, and
her backbone protruded
through her thin body as did
her pelvic bones. Her nose
was quite pointed due to the
lower jaw being set back,
making her face appear
rather puffy.

“But we loved her in-
stantly. We were careful to
explain to our two children,
Rachel and Aron. that Betsy
could not stay with us for—
ever; that we could keep her
only until she felt better and
then she would have to go
back to the woods or to a
zoo or animal farm.”

Continuing in diary form
Mrs. Steward wrote:

“March 4: This evening I

pie/mag tauer Aseunog —

was feeding Betsy cedar. I
stuck one end of a short
branch in my mouth and
she ate the green olfthe oth—
er end. Her eye looked right
into my eye, and she nuz-
zled my cheek with her
nose. We can’t bear the
thought ofturning her back
to the woods before she has
the strength to survive.
“March 10: It surprises us
that Betsy makes no effort
to get out of her pen. When
she ﬁrst came to stay with
us, although she was so
weak, she somehow strug-
gled out. It makes us feel
better about having her con-
ﬁned to see her contented.
“March 18: Today a
neighbor called to borrow
our snowshoes. The snow-
shoes hang from the rafters
down cellar, and I had an
uneasy feeling about her
seeing Betsy. ‘What is that?’
she exclaimed. I told her.
She said, ‘It is kind ofiffy as
to whether you did the right
thing. You did interfere with
the balance of nature.’ We
have felt that if people be-
came upset, the game war-
den~would have no choice
but to take her away, and be-
cause of her deformities
probably destroy her. I hope
[haven’t sealed Betsy’s fate
for a pair of snowshoes.
“April 10: Every other day
I stop along the road and
gather cedar boughs for her.
So far no one has asked
what I was doing, but I have
my answer all thought up. ‘I
love the smell of cedar in the

can conﬁne her legally. I did
contact one animal farm
that seemed interested, but
when I described Betsy’s
handicaps they said they
didn’t want any ‘freaks.’ We
have done all that we can for
Betsy. We have. helped her
make it through a difﬁcult
winter, now perhaps she will
be able to survive winters on
her own. If she can’t, per-
haps we have just prolonged
her misery. I hope we have
done more than just that.
“May 2: Bob appeared in
the cellar doorway with a
somewhat reluctant Betsy
in his arms. He put her
down and she gingerly took
a few steps on the dew-
soaked grass. She looked
back at the cellar door now
tightly closed behind her.

‘ Bob opened the door so she

could go back inside if she
wanted to. As if this choice
helped her make up her
mind, she turned toward the
open ﬁeld, raised her tail for
the ﬁrst time since she had
been with us, and gracefully,
strongly, and proudly leaped

 

across the lawn and over th
crest ofthe hill. . .

We discussed Betsy’s
plight and the Stewards’ de-
cision with a 26-year veter-
an Vermont warden. His re~
ply was swift and direct.

“We get a lot of well-
meaning people who think
they’re doing the best thing.
But it seriously undermines
our work. Every spring we
have a run of so-called
‘abandoned’ deer. People
don’t understand that the
mothers leave them all day
in tall grass or at the edge of
the forest until they come
back. We don’t hear about it
until it’s too late — until the
deer-are domesticated to the
point they’re crippled for
the wild.

“Now that deer (Betsy)
was about to curl up and go
to sleep -— nature’s way to
eliminate the weak. Yes,
they brought her back, but
that deer will likely have the
same problem the next win-
ter. And there’s this: how
much do you want to save
crippled animals to mix in
with a healthy herd? It’s not
sound game management.
If that deer is lucky she
might fulﬁll someone’s doe
tag come fall.”

A FIRST PERSON ACCOUNT BY SOMEONE WHO’S BEEN THERE AND BACK

 

Flying
with a Pet

When you won’t leave
home without it

by Diane Melville

fter many years as a reporter in Italy, I decided I
needed a change of pace. I wanted to go back

home to Rochester, New York, but I wanted to

keep a foothold in Europe as well. The ideal solution, it '

seemed, would be to spend six months a year in
Florence and six months in the United States.

Then I remembered one not so minor, 60-pound,
furry detail. My German shepherd, Amira. I certainly
couldn't abandon her to a kennel for six months. Like
it or not, she would have to ﬂy home with me.

But I didn't like it. I knew Amira was far too big to
travel in the passenger compartment, and I had heard
' the most frightening tales about the fate of pets who

travel in cargo holds: They get very sick, probably
never recover from the psychological trauma, and
almost freeze to death because of hold temperatures
well below zero. Moreover, if a pet did manage to
survive the airsickness, the shock, and the cold, it
would probably die a terrible death anyway because, I
was warned, the cargo hold isn’t pressurized.

Still, I had reason to hope this was merely exaggerat-
ed hearsay. On numerous occasions, I had observed
travelers with their dogs at the check-in counters in
international airports. I had seen them again upon
arrival. If those dogs had survived, why shouldn’t
Amira have a successful ﬂight, too? .

In any case, I wasn’t going to leave anything to
chance. A bit of investigation was in order.

I began by contacting travel agencies. No one knew
anything about air travel for pets, and no one seemed
to care. When I started calling some of the major
airlines, their reservations offices gave me a standard
and all-too-brief . reply: Make a reservation for ybur pet,
check in at least two hours before your ﬂight, make
arrangements for a travel kennel, and have the animal
vaccinated. These were things I could have surmised
myself. I wanted more details; in short, I needed to
hear something that would dispel my fears.

There was only one airline left to contact: TWA.
Fortunately, TWA’s office in Rome had an old copy of a
no-longer-published 12-page pamphlet called “Con-
sumer Information About Air Travel for Pets” that

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

supplied detailed information pertaining to vaccina-
tions, health requirements, and the kind of kennel to
purchase. One very good suggestion was to always try
to take direct ﬂights, thus avoiding the long layovers.
It also advised that dogs or cats can travel in the
passenger cabin with their owners, provided they are
small enough to fit in a container that must be placed
under the seat in front of the passenger. (It’s impor-
tant to make reservations as early as possible, because
airline regulations allow only one pet per cabin.)
Unfortunately, Amira qualified as a large dog and
would have to travel in the cargo compartment.

A Trip to the Vet

Still, I had enough facts now to begin to organize my
dog's trip. The first step was a thorough checkup by a
veterinarian, who told me that the most important
thing was the condition of a pet’s heart and lungs. It is
advisable for the pet to have an electrocardiogram; if
the animal’s heart is healthy, it should have no
problem. Since it is always a good idea to calm the
animal down a bit, the veterinarian prescribed a
tranquilizer to be given a couple of hours before the
ﬂight. He also suggested that I should give my dog a
tranquilizer about 15 days before the trip just to see if
it would make her drowsy and calm. Actually, these
tranquilizers are fairly bland and nontoxic; in some
cases they work and in some :f‘iey don’t. I got
wonderful results at home and fervently hoped that
the results would be just as good on the airplane. I was
beginning to entertain some doubts. Lastly, the veteri—
narian prepared a Certificate of Health and a Rabies

 

 

Vaccination Certificate specifying the date of the
vaccination and the kind of vaccine used. In short, he
OK’d my dog’s ﬂight.

So far so good, The next thing was the travel kennel.
Many pet shOps both in Italy and the United States
carry them in a variety of sizes, from the small version
with the carrying handle to the extra large (the kennel
should be large enough for a pet to stand upand turn
around); prices range from approximately $30 to $75.
Needless to say, Amira needed the larger, more
expensive one. Airlines also supply these kennels if
ordered in advance; the cost is just about the same. I
ordered mine from TWA.

HaVing accomplished that much, I contacted the
American Embassy in Rome just to be certain about
US. health regulations. A spokesman confirmed what
the TWA booklet had said: A health certificate and the
rabies vaccination—given during the last 30 days
before departure—were all that was needed for Amira to
enter the continental United States. (Hawaii has a 120-
day quarantine.) The same applies for entry in most
European countries, except Great Britain, where a six-
month quarantine is required and strictly enforced.

With everything in order, all that was left to do was
to confirm the ﬂight reservations and pay for the
tickets—a rather expensive one for me and a $74 (one-
way) ticket for my four-legged friend.

Now that I had dispensed with the formalities and
practicalities, I could begin to relax. Or so I thought
until friends, acquaintances, and even some strangers
began making sinister predictions. I was accused of
cruelty for making my dog “ﬂy." I began to worry all

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

over again and once more contacted a ‘I'WA sales

representative who painstakingly answered all my
questions. I was assured that pets are not thrown in
with the baggage; there is an area set aside for the
animals in the cargo compartment that is fully
pressurized. The temperature down there is 25 to 30
degrees lower than in the passenger cabin, and
according to my veterinarian, too much heat is really
not good for dogs anyway. The TWA sales representa-
tive told me animals are loaded onto the plane last and
are taken off first upon arrival. Attendants would
personally bring Amira to me after unloading her.

Witholding Food and Water

As the airline (and the vet) advised, I stopped
Amira’s food 6 to 12 hours before departure and
withheld water 2 hours before to avoid airsickness.
This gave me something more to worry about: My dog
is always thirsty. Anyway, a quick call to the veterinar-
ian solved the problem. Dogs, I found out, can go
without water even for a whole day. All I had to do was
give my dog lots of water as soon as we arrived. I did
check with personnel at the airport to see if someone
could give the dog water in case of delays and long
waits. Unfortunately, I was told that they aren't
equipped to do it. So all I could do was hope that she
would not get desperately thirsty during the ﬂight.

We arrived at the airport well before takeoff time.
The kennel was ready and, as kennels go, it was quite
nice—sturdy, spacious, and well ventilated. I put a
blanket on the bottom and put a couple of Amira’s
favorite toys in just to give her a feeling of home (a

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

good suggestion contained in the TWA booklet). Amira
got in to investigate; she seemed satisfied with her
temporary home. “This is going to work out just fine,"
I thought to myself. But as I closed the doors. she
began a rhythmic, relentless barking. Ilooked around
the terminal in embarrassment, but people smiled
understandingly. The TWA attendant reassured me:
“Don’t worry, Miss, they all bark like this at first. She’ll
be all right."

As I watched an attendant carry her off toward the
plane, I got panicky: What if they forgot to load Amira
on the plane, or put her on the wrong ﬂight? I chased
after the attendant and asked him about it. Solicitous-
ly, he told me that when I got to the boarding gate,
there would be a TWA employee with a two—way radio
that put him in touch with the people down on the
runway. All I had to do was ask him to inquire if my
dog was on board. And that is what I did. I was relieved
when they confirmed that an angry, barking dog had
been loaded.

I would be lying if I said that I didn’t worry all the
way into New York. It was a profound relief to see
Amira ten hours later at John F. Kennedy Airport,
wide-eyed, bewildered, but perfectly healthy and hap-
py. I let her out of the kennel and proceeded toward
customs. As the customs official looked at my pass-
port and the dog's certificates, Amira licked his hand.
He smiled, patted her on the head, and said: “Welcome
to the United States, pooch.”

My 12-year-old dog had just completed her maiden
ﬂight across the Atlantic, and we’d both come through
with ﬂying colors. I

Woman endures dog of a day

”By MARTY SABOTA

 

:Staff Writer

Beatrice Stewart knew it
wasn’t her day when her pit bull
dog attacked four people, a thief
set her car on fire and a~ fire-
fighter planted an ax in her
dog’s nose.

Before the sequence of unlike-
1y events had ended Monday
evening, Stewart’s dog had bit-
ten her, her 10-year-old daugh—
ter, the manager. of the Fort
,Worth motel where she lives and

a neighbor. Her car had burned
up. And her dog was taken away
by animal control. _

The saga began when she mlS-

Fort Worth police said the 20—
year-old woman had used a pub-
lic telephone outside her room at
the Star Motel at 9700 S. Free—
way and apparently left her car
keys on top of the phone.

"She was back in her room

when she heard somie'bcﬂv start—

But the would-be thief didn’t
know that Stewart’s husband
had turned the car into a fire
hazard by removing the carbure: -

So, as Stewart looked outside
the car burst into flames. Soon
after that, a man jumped from
the burning car.

’Stewart told police the last

time she saw him he was run—

At that point. things started to
get complicated.

Stewart heard her daughter,
Kristi. screaming in the bath—

and found that her lO-month-old
pit bull Rosco had the young girl
pinned to the floor.

‘ Grim e -f1'g11 ting dog
named top cop canine

By Harry Harris

The Tribune

, An Oakland Police Depart-
ment canine unit member, who
loves cats and children but won’t
hesitate to bark a suspect up a
tree, has been honored as best in
the West.

Jago, a 6-year-old German
shepherd, and his handler, Offi-
cer Dennis Dutra, were named
last weekend as best dog and
handler by the Western States
Police Canine Association.

In gaining the honor, in a year-
long series of competitions
against contestants from as far

away as Wyoming, Jago de-'

throned last year’schampion, a
«female shepherd from Manteca
named Terra, by two points.
This year was the second com-
petitive season for Jago, an 87-
., pounder who is the senior mem-
her and top dog in the depart-
ment’s canine corps.
The Western states competi-
tions involved tests in obedience,
agility, building and field
searches, and attack training.
Among other things, Jago was
judged on his response to hand
signals, climbing over walls, as--
reending ladders, finding a per-
-son tucked away under mat-
i'tresses in a cage, and response-to
«.avsuspect firing a gun.
In between the competitions,
which have earned Jago and Du-
tra more than 30 trOphies, the

team has been involved in some
80 arrests. That is one-third of
all arrests the canine unit has
made since it formation more
than three years ago.

They and the rest of the can-
ines and their handlers also give
demonstrations at schools, sen-
ior citizens centers and other or-
ganizations.

Jago would offer no decipher-
able comment on the award, but
Dutra said he took it in stride.
Actually, said Dutra, J ago would
probably have preferred some~
thing to eat, rather than the
three~foot high traphy.

Dutra said although suspects
might not like Jago, he gets
along fine with children -— es-
pecially the officer’s four young-
sters - and other animals, espe-
cially cats.

At Dutra’s home, Jago pleas-
antly allows two cats to sleep on
his blanket, and will gingerly
step over them to avoid waking
them.

But, at work, he won’t hesitate
to pick a bone with a suspect.
Two years ago, he sniffed out
and cornered in the Eastbay hills

“A lot of times I’ll talk to him

Of course, there are some ad-

he next time you

I return from an over-

- seas trip, don’t be,
surprised if a droopy-ear'ed
beagle saunters over to your
bags and begins to sniff them
curiously. The dog, and its
handler, are part of a pilot
project started by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Animal
and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) to intercept
prohibited products, which
could harbor potentially dev-
astating pests and diseases.
(Remember the Medfly infes-
tation in California in 1981? It
is thought that these pests,
which almost destroyed the
citrus crop, came to the Unit-
ed States in uninspected
fruit. The cost to eradicate
them was more than $100 mil-
lion.) The inspection teams
are currently patrolling bag-
gage-claim areas for inter—
national ﬂights arriving in
San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Houston and New York’s
Kennedy Airport.

Beagles were selected
because of their exceptionally
sensitive sense of smell and
because they are gentle with
humans—and look it. Togeth-
er with their handlers, they
go through an intensive 12—

 

week training regimen during
which they are taught to rec-
ognize the scents of fruits and
meats. When they sniff any
forbidden goods, the beagles,
who sport green jackets, qui-
etly sit next to the suspect
piece of luggage and are given
a reinforcing treat by their
handlers. The handler will

.then attach a green quaran-

tine tag to the baggage and
mark a large green “A” on
the passenger’s Customs Dec-
laration Form. After going
through normal customs pro-
cedures, the person is sent to
an APHIS inspector. Justice
is meted out on the spot: if
any prohibited agricultural
items are found, the offender
has to pay a $25-$50 fine
immediately. A person can
contest the ﬁnding in court,
but if he or she loses, the pen-
alty can go as high as $1,000.
The canine patrols most
likely will be expanded to as
many as 30 airports around
the country. To be sure that
you don’t find a beagle point-

e’d been con-

templating an

issue on wild-
life for quite some time.
It seemed inevitable.
Whenever we publi-
cized an article on see-
ing animals in their
natural habitats, our
readers responded with
an interest bordering
on passion. Editors who
went off on assignment
to seek out creatures
great or small returned
with the conscience of
conservationists — and,
believe me, they did not
have it when they left
home. It all added up to
full-scale treatment, so
we set senior editor and ardent animal
lover Kitty Mackey to the task of selecting
four exotic adventures in the wild, all on
different continents, with entirely differ-
ent wildlife.

Picture editor Bill Black and senior
editor Chris Hunt sought—and found—a
dizzying profusion of African mammals
and birds on the Serengeti Plain of Tanza-
nia. Geoffrey Wolff, deep into his biogra-
phy of Herman Melville, took time out to
play a modern Ahab as he went whale-
watching in Baja California. David Atten-
borough, famous for his splendid books
and PBS series Life on Earth and The
Living Planet, gives a fascinating account
of his trip to the eerie, primordial world
of the Galapagos Islands, “one place on
earth where the reptiles still rule." In
addition to planning the issue, Kitty
Mackey stalked tigers, rhinos and other
animals in Nepal and stayed at one of the
world‘s most comfortable game lodges,
Tiger Tops.

I, on the other hand, went to the
Bronx Zoo for the day. Now, you might
think this meant I drew the short stick, but
my little foray, a mere 30 minutes from
Manhattan, took me where I had never
before been—into an Asian rain forest.

WINDOW SEAT

WONDERFUL WILDLIFE, NEAR AND FAR

With zoologist Dr. William Conway at jungleWorld.

In June, the Bronx Zoo opened
JungleWorld as part of its 40-acre Wild
Asia area. This new and permanent exhib-
it re-creates life in a tropical environment.
JungleWorld is lush, magical and mysteri-
ous, full of exotic sounds, fragrant with
ﬂowers. It is a huge (37,000 square feet),
humid blend of organic life and facsimile
landscapes. The man-made parts are
straight out of a Steven Spielberg set:
pools and streams, waterfalls, granite and
lava formations and cloud machines. The
real part consists of rain-forest vegetation
and creatures such as narrow-snouted
crocodiles from India called gharials, gi—
ant turtles, great hornbills, Malayan tapirs,
proboscis monkeys, gibbons and black
“panthers” (which are actually leopards).
Most of these animals were bred at either
the Bronx or other zoos. The exhibit
represents the New York Zoological Soci-
ety’s impressive conservation efforts in 28
countries around the world.

My guide on this safari was Dr. Wil-
liam Conway, general director of the New
York Zoological Society and Jungle-
World’s guiding force. Together, we
roamed through the Scrub Forest, where
I watched a mugger crocodile who stood
so still, mouth wide open, that he looked

like the taxidermist‘s lat-
est trophy. But he was
alive—not too lively but
alive nonetheless. We
entered the Mangrove
Forest, although the
mangrove trees aren't
real (“They would never
last,” said Dr. Conway).
We saw those marvel-
ous, silly-looking pro-
boscis monkeys, with
their Jimmy Durante
beaks, sunning them-
selves languidly on tree
branches (the sun pour-
ing down from 55-foot-
high skylights).

Not all of the ani-
mal life at JungleWorld
is large or recognizable.
Dr. Conway referred to “the unseen multi-
tude,” adding that the rain forest has more
biological diversity and more species than
any habitat on earth. “In Malaysia alone
there are more than 1,000 species of but-
terﬂies. And for every jungle species
known, there remain 40 yet undiscovered.
We know more about distant planets than
about the nearest rain forest."

The rain forest is a fragile place, a
message that comes through most stir-
ringly when you exit from the exhibit. A
“jungle countdown” indicates the approx-
imate number of acres of jungle still
standing. Each minute, the number de—
creases at an alarming rate of 50 acres.
Next to this is a human “population
countup,” increasing at a rate of 150 peo-
ple each minute and posing one of the
greatest threats to wildlife survival.

What all of this means—and the
responsibility it entails—is put best by
David Attenborough at the end of Life
on Earth: “The fact is that no species
has ever had such wholesale control
over everything on earth, living or dead,
as we now have. In our hands now lies
not only our own future, but that of
all other living creatures with whom we
share the earth.” I

OAKLAND TRIBUNE (CA) - Oct. 22, 1985

~ City to weigh
bailout for .
Oakland zoo

By Kathy Zimmerman . .. ,,
The Tribal» . . .

The fate of Oakland’s Knowland Park Zoo
could be decided when the city council meets at 3
pm. today to consider recommendations aimed at
keeping the financially troubled 200 Open until at
least next June. - '* -

The city staff is recommending the council
establish a $120,000 contingency fund for the zoo
and authorize the transfer of $66,000 from an ac-
count currently earmarked for road repairs at the
East Oakland zoo to a capital improvement fund.

The East Bay Zoological Society, which oper-
ates the zoo, has said it needs $350,000 imme-
diately to cover its deficit and buy badly needed
new primate cages. '

In 1983, the zoo was rated one of the 10 worst
in the nation by an United States Humane Society
investigator, who said Oakland cannot “properly
care for nor exhibit its animals.” ,

In all, the East Bay Zoological Society has
projected a $544,000 deficit for the year, including
$370,000 needed to improve some animal enclo-
sures to bring the zoo up to a “contemporary.
professional level.”

The society is seeking council approval of a
much larger public subsidy, including $246,000 for
capital improvements and $121,880 to Operate the
zoo.

Mayor Lionel Wilson and other council mem-
bers have said they will not support a public bail-
out of the zoo, blaming the zoo’s financial prob~

lems on poor management by the nonprofit sociev
ty.

“I’m not in favor Of putting any more money
into the zoo right now,” said Council member Cart~
er Gilmore. He added “something’s wrong with the
way they’ve been managing it.” .

Council member Leo Bazile, whose distriét
includes the zoo, said he wants to help keep the zoo
Open.

“The zoo belongs to us,” Bazile said. “It’s like
deciding whether we‘re going to keep Lake Mer~

ritt. . . . It’s our responsibility so
we should be the main suppOrt-
ers of it.”

Joel Parrott, zoo general
manager, said yesterday he was
unSure whether the society
would accept the recommenda-
tions of the city staff. He said the
primate cages could not be im~
proved with the limited amount
proposed.

The city staff is also recom~
mending the council agree to
continue funding four city" main-
tenance Workers at a cost Of
about $150,000 for the year.

This year the society was to
begin contributing to the cost Of
employing the maintenance
workers, and eventually carry
the total cost in 1991.

The only Other money the so-
ciety received from the city to
date was about $300,000 for cap-
ital improvements in 1982.

Without a strong “commit-
ment” from the city to help the
zoo, the society said it has been
unable to attract substantial pri-
vate donations.

The city staff is recommend-
ing that Oakland's Parks and
Recreation Advisory Commis-
sion study the 600-animal zoo’s
long-range funding problems
and report back to the council
with recommendations in Feb-
ruary.

Parrott said the society pre-
fers to organize a “blue-ribbon”
committee, composed Of corpo-
rate nd city officials to study the
200‘s problems. Those corporate
Officials could help the zoo
launch a successful fund-raising
drive in the private sector, he
said.

The council will also consider
a prOposal to revise parking fees
at the zoo and begin charging for
admission. Under that plan,
parking fees would be reduced
from $3 to $2 per car, while ad-
mission would be $2 per adult 1
and $1 for 3- to 16-year-olds.

Although raising fees will “in-
variably exclude significant por-
tions of the community at the
lewer economic levels,” the so—
ciety said, without a hefty city
subsidy it is the only alternative.

Even charging for admittance
to the zoo may not be enough,
Parrott has said, noting, “it’s de-
batable whether we can Operate
self-sufficently.”

 

 

 




LOS ANGELES SUNDAY Magazine - Nov. 3, 1985

Continued/thing may have been

disclosed about the true nature of

cats. Whenever I have been at the
ANIMALS Wrights’ house, it has been Larry

who is properly appreciative of Jack.
Also, Jack is always responsive to
Larry. Larry concluded from this that
Jack respected his intelligence.

This turned out to be false, count-
er-factual, just plain wrong. Wright
told me that during the absence of
Jack’s women, the cat yowled in a
primal way up and down the hall-
way, swore vigorously and once
even attempted entrance to the bed-
room—a thing unimagined in the 11
years of Jack’s life. Further, this cata-
clysmic absence of the women gave
Wright occasion to find out what
Jack thought of his general compe-
tence. On the first morning, Wright
fed Jack for the first time in a dec-
ade. Jack’s usual response to his
food is to dig in. This time, howev~
er, he approached his dish suspi-
ciously, stared meaningfully at
Wright and then spat angrily before
stalking away with his tail high.

Wright is a philosopher, so of
course he meditated on this event,
wondering What It All Meant. In the
course of meditating, he recalled
that Jack has declared Wright’s study
off-limits. He never enters that
room, the one with the heavy-duty
books liningthe walls. Wright had
supposed this was evidence of Jack’s
respect for him, and so he tried to
console the cat for the absence of
Gerry and Emily by inviting him in-
to the study—offering, as he

there for 10 days while his owner de--

Said animal control officer Bill Bra-
ham: “Pit bulls are just unpredictable.
One minute they will lick you, but the
next minute they will bite you.”

Some choice.

Said the wife of the bitten motel ovm~
er: “The dog is a real good dog. but he
just got real excited with the car on fire.”

Sure. Here, good doggie, have an arm
for dinner.

I realize pit bulls are a breed unto
themselves, but when was the last time
you heard about a cat terrorizing a flock
of firemen?

A cat, faced with a burning car and a
cacophony of sirens, Would not attack
his owner. If the noise were unbearable,
he’d simply go away —-— probably to
summon an attorney. If the noise were
bearable, he’d feign indifference until
quiet returned, then take revenge in
subtle fashion, such as clawing holes in
that priceless handmade quilt that has
been in the family for generations.

Cats normally vent their frustrations
on property, not people. which I find
eminently sensible.

People, after all, can revenge personal
injury by having animals imprisoned
and killed. Cats, knowing this, are clev-
er enough to use restraint. ,

You notice the animal-control officer
who described pit bulls as “unpredict-
able" mentioned licking as a positive at-
tribute. This is probably the worst thing
about dogs. a character defect dog peo-
ple attempt to pass off as an asset.

Dogs show affection by slobbering,
preferably on a human face. I‘ve never
understood the attraction in having my
face licked by a mastiff. Dogs rarely use
breath mints, but it’s not the odor that
bothers me. I just don’t like being
slapped with a drippy dog tongue.

Cats have rough but dainty tongues,
which they keep to themselves. Oh,

' there are exceptions. I once had a cat

who washed my hair, an endearing if
painful idiosyncrasy. But I always fig-
ured that cat had a little dog blood in
him somewhere. .

Most dogs I‘ve met, not just pit bulls,
have been unpredictable. Even those
cute little cocker spaniels will bite if
you’re foolish enough to turn your back.
Ask any mailman.

I hope Rosco beats the rap and finds
employment as a security guard in some
other state. I have to root for a dog who
will single-pawedly take on the Fort
Worth Fire Department. But I don’t
want him as a pet, thank you.

Still, I‘m grateful to Rosco for his out:
burst. Gives me plenty of ammunition
next time my kids claim to want a puppy.
Anyway. my cat says the only dog he'll
share space with is a stuffed Snoopy

 




THE TAMPA TRI BUNE

- Nov. 6, 1985

Martinez turns
$6.5 million loan

into grant for zoo

Mayor Bob Martinez said he hopes Lowry Park
Zoo renovation will be accelerated now that ’
private funds can be used for further
expansion rather than loan repayment.

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune Staff Writer

A $6.3 million loan the city made
to the Lowry Park Zoo Association in
1984 to launch a $14.5 million zoo
renovation will not have to be re-
paid, Tampa Mayor Bob Martinez
announced Tuesday.

“While the money was allocated
to the association in the form of a
loan, we are changing it to a grant,”
Martinez said, allowing the remodel-
ing to be accelerated and association
members to concentrate on solicit-
ing private funds for further expan-
sion rather than repaying the loan.

Martinez said he also is recom-
mending boosting the zoo renovation
plans with an anticipated $5 million
the city will receive from the ex-
pected sale of 27 acres on Boy Scout
Boulevard where the J. Clifford
MacDonald Center is located.

The city and county both will re-
ceive an allotment of money under a
proposal to sell the land to the Dal-

las-based Vantage Companies and
move the handicapped training cen-
ter to the University of South Flor-
ida campus.

The final sale isn’t anticipated
until next year, with Vantage propos-
ing a multimillion-dollar retail trade
center for the land.

Martinez first announced the
$6.3 million loan to the zoo associa-
tion in May 1984, when a prelimi-
nary renovation plan was unveiled
' by the New Orleans-based firm of
Design Consortium.

At that time, Martinez said it was
thought the city would have to bor-
row the money for the zoo project,
until a fund-raising campaign could
be started.

But as a result of the-city’s suc-
cess 1n refunding several bond
issues, such as on Public Works De-
partment projects, Martinez said
several million doiiars became
available for the city.

“This made it unnecessary for
the city to have to borrow money to
replace that allocated for the zoo,”
Martinez said.

Association Chairman Michael
Osterhout thanked Martinez for the
$6.5 million gift to expedite the zoo
project and expressed confidence
that “the private sector will rally to
match the city’s leadership in contri-

buting more than an equivalent
amount in corporate and individual
donations.”

The association is expected to
launch its fund-raising campaign
early next year, following several
briefings the association has been
holding to explain the 200 plan to
area corporations and citizens.

Zoo Superintendent Doug Porter
said the design for the first phase of
renovation has been completed, and
that design work on a second phase,
including a Florida wildlife exhibit,

is beginning.

The first phase of what will be A:

the Lowry Park Zoological Garden is
scheduled for completion in the
spring 1987, with a second phase to
be completed in 1988 and a third
phase in 1989.

The first section of the new zoo
to open will include an Asian exhibit
with elephants and other animals, a
monkey or primate attraction, and
an aviary. A new zoo entrance and
administration buildings also will be
included.

Jack Hanna got that makes

him wear so well after seven
years of cloying praise and unrelent-
1ng celebrity?

Laurie Lennard, a roducer of the
“David Letterman S ow,” on which
Hanna has appeared three times,
may have part of the answer to Han-
na’s sustained popularity. She re-
gards him from the viewpoint of a
television, veteran who’s seen stars
come and go. “There’s always an air
of confusion and hysteria around
Jack,” she says, laughing. Now we’re
getting somewhere. This sounds like
a guy who’s a little more interesting
and a little less good, a man who’s
vulnerable and sympathetic. His his-
tory in Columbus bears out Len—

nard’s observation. Take a few slices
from Jack Hanna’s recent life:

0 Debbie Casto, zoo marketing di—
rector, likes to tell about the time
Hanna captured the snow leopards.
Almost. After the snow leopards ar-
rived at the zoo, they spent some
time routinely quarantined in a zoo
barn. When their confinement was
over, their keepers were under-
standably reluctant to go in and
bring them out. The zoo veterinarian

to toe in chain-link fencing, he start-
ed into the barn. “Well, you can’t
walk wrapped in chain—link fence,”
Debbie Casto comments dryly, “but
most of all you can’t catch a snow
leopard.” The inevitable happened.
Hanna toppled over, couldn’t et up,
and had to be dragged out of arm’s
way by his feet.

Jack Hanna, it seems, is a oneman

Hill’s seventy-six trombones and the
big bass drum. Things get all stirred
up when he’s around. In the way that
some 1people s ell t—r-o-u-bl-e, and
their 'ends uck when they see
them coming, Hanna spells a—c—t—i-on.
He’s a powerful magnet for televi-
sion cameras, reporters’ pens, devot-
ed volunteers and generous checks.
Columbus and the Columbus Zoo
have never been quite the same since
Hanna hit town, and the adventure
is far from over. Despite the lure of
the TV lights, it looks as if the man
may actually stick around.

Back in the mid ’70s when Ed Dorsa
was a CETA worker there, the Co-
lumbus Zoo was “a real zoo,” Dorsa
says, and he doesn’t mean that as a
compliment. “The only thing on the

other side of Rt. 257 was the bird
pond. It was just real mediocre in ev-
erything. It was an old-boy organiza-
tion and there wasn’t any profes-
sionalism.” The zoo had been around
ever since the Dispatch Printing
Com any had given seven Alaskan
rein eer to the city in 1926 and of—
fered to build them shelters out on
some city-owned property near
O’Shau hnessy Dam. Since then, in
spite o producing the ﬁrst gorilla
born in ca tivity, the zoo had often
languishe from official inattention.
By Dorsa’s time, as he remembers,
morale was low, but change was in
the air.

“Mel Dodge made a commitment
to the zoo at that point, and Jack was
the result,” he recalls.

“We were looking for Jack Hanna,
and we found him,” admits Mel
Dodge, legendary former head of
the city’s Recreation and Parks De-
partment. In 1977 the zoo opera—
tions were given to his department,
and if there’s anything Dodge can’t
do in Columbus, it’s to leave well
enough alone.

Hanna was one of 40 or 50 con-
tenders for the job of director of
Dodge’s “new” zoo. He hailed from a
farm near Knoxville, Tennessee,
where, according to several sources,
his animal mania surfaced early.
Dodge says that Hanna’s father used
to complain that after Jack hit high
school age the elder Hannas didn’t
dare go on vacation for fear there
would be lions or elephants in the
barn when they got back.

with his bride Suzi after getting a
bachelor’s degree from Muskingum
College, Hanna ran a pet store and
pettin zoo for a while. Then some
really Tiad luck caught him. First, a

no ault of Hanna’s, had his arm bit-
ten off by Jack’s lion. Then illness:
Hanna caught hepatitis from a chimp
and s nt a month in the hospital.
Wit his animal businesses closed,
Hanna was picked up by Gu Smith
Jr., director of the Knoxvile Zoo,
and given his ﬁrst taste of zoo man—
a ement from the ground up. Sharon
A ercrombie, now a reporter for

the Columbus Citizen—Joumal, hap-
pened to be on the zoo beat in Knox-
ville back in 1967 -’68. Until Smith
and Hanna cleaned it up, Knoxville
had what she calls “a barnyard zoo.”
She remembers curator Jack Hanna
“shoveling up” after the animals and
driving around in an old pickup truck

uy mith' apparently was a man
after Hanna’s own heart, a showman
who turned 28 years in television to
good use as a zoo director. As Mel
Dodge tells it, Smith’s promotional
philosophy is, “Never go talk to peo-
ple about the zoo without an animal

in tow.” Smith says he took on the
zoo as art of an agreement with the

' of oxville to house his pet lion
cu , Joshua, who had become too old
to stay at home.

Between them, Smith and Hanna
worked to create a zoo out of an ill-
ke t menagerie. Today, the Knox-
vil e Zoo, like the one in Columbus, is
among America’s 25 zoos fully ac-
credited by the American Associa-
tion of Zoological Parks and Aquari-
ums (AAZPA).

Meanwhile, Hanna was hired away
to Sanford, Florida, for a short stint
with “a tiny little zoo right in the cen-
ter of town,” as Smith remembers,
that needed a dynamic zookeeper
who could raise money and, in effect,
make wine out of water. To help
with the miracle, Hanna ot hlS
friend Stan Brock, co-host o Marlin
Perkins’s “Wild Kingdom,” to run
barefoot over 150 miles of Central
Florida as a stunt.

Having set the Central Florida Zoo
on its way with money and a new lo-
cation, Hanna returned once more
to Knoxville to become vice presi-
dent of Stan Brock Wilderness Ad-
ventures. It was here that the search
committee for the Columbus Zoo
board found him.

Blaine Sickles, who was on the
search committee and is still a zoo
board member, recalls vividly now
that Hanna was by no means a shoo-
in for the job. At 31, Hanna had his
youth against him.

“But what we saw was good,” Sick-
les goes on. “The search committee
decided Jack was the guy, but we
knew some board members would be
hesitant. We knew an one [we hired]
would have to get along with Mel
Dodge. So we got Jack into town, got
him into a car, and drove him down
to the Armory [the Cultural Arts
Center], where he met Mel on the
steps. Then we went to One Nation
for lunch. It became a parent right
away that Jack and e1 communi-
cated really well.” But at the board
meeting that followed, the search
committee met resistance to hiring
so oung a man at the salary they
hadV in mind. Sickles laughs, remem—
bering how “Jack was prancing
around outside and becoming a bas—
ket case.” Finally, the search com-
mittee toughed it out, promising to
throw the whole question back in the
laps of the board, and opposition col-
lapsed. “Now there’s nobody who isn’t
in his corner,” Sickles claims.

So Hanna had a ackage he liked.
It was the kind 0 zoo Situation he
was getting good at, and Columbus

Children’s Hospital for his daughter
Julia’s leukemia (now in remission).

but up,” Hanna says of his arrival in
Columbus. “For 19 months I never
left this zoo—I’m talking Christmas
and Easter, too. Zoo employees had
bets that I’d never make it.’

The proof of how he and the Co-
lumbus Zoo have made it is out by
‘ O’Shau hnessy Dam for all to see.

Once there were a few wretched
buildings huddled to ether by the
river, all painted di erent colors.
Hanna himself admits, “Oh, yes, I
was embarrassed my ﬁrst three
years here to take an body on the
other side of the zoo from the ad-
ministration building], oing by the
old buildings. I’d do anyt 'ng to avoid
it.” In seven ears, With Mel Dodge
behind him, Hanna has carried out a
$4.6 million capital improvements

rogram that has included a new

erbivore—carnivore complex, a North
American exhibit and the Gorilla Vil-
la, as well as an amphitheatre and
other facilities. Attendance has shot
upl from 342,000 in 1978 to some-
w ere in the neighborhood of 800,000
this year. Hanna brags that the zoo
now is the fourth lar est crowd-

leaser in the state, trai ing onl ' the

tate Fair, Kings Island and edar
Point in attendance.

Debbie Casto ticks off her own list
of statistics. Columbus Zoo has the
ﬁnest reptile house in the world, and
it is one of the few zoos with an am-
phibian house, she says; it is the on]
zoo housing ﬁve generations of go ' -

las, the offspring of the famous breed-
ing program that began in the ’50s; it
has the largest cheetah collection
(19) and the only male pygmy forest
elephant in captivity; it is one of only
four zoos to breed bald eagles suc-
cessfully, a couple of which have been

released into t e wild.

And while all this has been coming
about, Jack Hanna, by a unique com-
bination of accident and des1gn, has

bloomed into a full-ﬂedged celebrity,

and MeFDodge could never have pre-
dicted they would et more than ust
a better zoo out 0 Hanna, but t ey
have otten more, and they like it.

Bac in 1978, everyone agreed
that the zoo needed public aware-
ness in order. to get public support.

e says those were the days when
eople had to be asked to be mem-
bers of the zoo board because, “Peo~
ple don’t want to be art of some—
thing that’s average. (Hanna, too,
got the picture when he ﬂew to Co-
umbus and discovered that neither
the airplane pilot nor a local taxi
driver had ever heard of a zoo here.)
Hence, the search for a zoo director

good.” But the hamburger he set out
to sell was still pretty raw, with no
extras. The zoo in its rundown state
really wasn’t much of an attraction.
What he sold successfully and with
increasin conﬁdence was himself.
While he ridles at the term“ ublici-

hound,” Hanna asserts, “I it’s for
t e zoo, I’ll do it.”

If it worried him at ﬁrst, it now is a
source of pride that “we’ve never

for their advertising. He is quick to
express gratitude to the media for

point is that he himself has attracted

tor of the AAZPA, calls Hanna “a
Rublic relations person personiﬁed.”

eporter Sharon Abercrombie says,

could manufacture the Great Cock-
roach Race? As Gu Smith sa s—and
who should know tter?—“ t helps
tremendously to be insane in the zoo
business.”

Fearless of overexposure, Hanna
has been seen and heard here, there
and eve here since he ﬁrst laid
siege to olumbus. Time was when
he never turned down an invitation
to speak —at Kiwanis or Rotary meet-
ings, grade—school assemblies, grad-
uation exercises, a television show
for WARL of Upper Arlin 11 High
School, almost an here t at two or
more people gat ered in the zoo’s
name. An he always took a zoo ani-
mal along. For two years he and his
daughter Kathy co-hosted one of the
better locally produced television
shows, “Hanna’s Ark.” When Chan-
nel 10 dropped it with a thud in 1983,
Hanna was publicly disap ointed,
but now he says di lomatica y, “The
Eveay things worke out were for the

st.”

In 1978, his ﬁrst year on the job,
Hanna gave 64 speeches, moved the
popular gorillas to better quarters in
the old pachyderm house, ot new
zoo uniforms and allowed t e goril-
las to be ﬁlmed for a National Geo-

phic television special. In 1979 he
hissed the Columbus Symphon at a
July zoo concert, publicized a ame-
the-Gorilla contest for a fourth gen-
eration bab (Cora) and rescued a
cat from O’ hauﬁhnessy Dam. Two
years of good, c eap publicity. The
rescue nussion beneﬁted more than
just the cat, for Hanna has made the
papers again and again since then by
p ling a puppy from an air-condi-
tioning duct 1n the middle of the
night and other feats of humanity.

As the zoo programs and p)hysical
plant improved (thanks to odge’s
influence, a federal grant and 18-hour
days by the zoo director), Hanna also

e more sophisticated and wide
ranging in his publicity efforts, mak-
ing ever more television appear-
ances, greeting visiting digmtaries
at the ' rt with exotic zoo ani-
mals, leading well-publicized safaris
or fact-ﬁnding trips abroad and
kee ing in constant touch with the
m 'a. In 1983 he almost a came a
cropper with one homegrown brain-
storm. And he’s almost sorry.

“It was wrong,” he says, and then
half takes it back. “It wasn’t wrong
from the standpoint of what I did, it
was probably wrong for the whole
zoo world. Not for Columbus, but for
people who are trying to understand
zoos.”

It was a Vintage Hanna event, her-
alded with eat fanfare. On May 15,
circus pergoli'mer Enrico Wallenda
of the Great Wallendas walked a
tightrope over a pit of Bengal tigers.

 




“I had 15,000 peOple in the zoo that
day, one of the blggest days we’ve
ever had,” Hanna says, still savoring
the public relations triumph. The
AAZPA, however, was 1iv1d. “I al-
most got called before the ethics
~ committee,” he admits.

AAZPA chief Robert Wagner still
pronounces his view of the stunt
with a good deal of Vigor: “We hold
that that is total and complete ex-
ploitation of the Bengal tigers. It
could have resulted in serious injury
or death to the performer, and also
the inappropriate and uncalled-for
death of one of the cats. It showed
man’s dominion over the animals—
totally related to Showmanship and
the Circus, not to the standards of
zookeeping.” Having once more read
the riot act, Wagner softens: “I’m an
o timist. The good that came out of
t at bad situation was that Jack
Hanna learned his lesson about our
standard of ethics for zoos and zoo-
keeping.”

Maybe. But he still ain’t ot no re-
spect. Blaine Sickles says t at when
Hanna was asked what he would
have done if Wallenda had taken a
dive into the tiger it, Hanna cracked
that he guessed e’d just have to
shoot one or the other — leaving it en-
tire] an open question whether it
wouild be the Wallenda or the tiger.

Sickles sa s of him, “You never
know what he’s going to say next,”
and of Hanna’s undeniable charm
sure y is his unpredictability. He is
almost a match for the animals he
squires around. “He’s famous for al-
ways getting bitten and always los—
ing animals,” Casto says. Once he
carried a crow to the Letterman
Show; it ﬂew out into the studio au-
dience and refused to come back.
Hanna took this mutiny with aplomb
but vowed to bring along next time a
vulture that would retrieve the
crow. On the New York tri when he
pulled the giant cockroac es from

is pocket in the lobby of the Berk-
shire Hotel, he later was summoned
sternly from his room b the hotel
manager. One ﬂoor be ow a dis-
traught guest was standin on her
bed in hysterics while one o Hanna’s
roaches moseyed about her room.
“You bad boy,” Hanna scolded, scoop
inaup the four-inch-long offender, ‘I
to you not to leave my pocket.”
Oddly enough, Hanna still is we]-
come at the Berkshire. Could it be
that, in spite of cockroaches in his
pockets, he really has what Robert
Wagner calls “gentlemanly charisma”?

Trying to pinpoint the basis for his
star status on the Letterman Show
(“one of our favorite guests,” she de-
clares), Laurie Lennard analyzes the
Hanna ap . “He’s unaware of him—
self and t e effect he has on people,”

she e lains. “He’s completely natu-
ral. A ot of times people try too hard
to be funny. He works well with Dave
because he’s sincere.” She thinks
some more. “He doesn’t do anything;
it’s the way things come out of his
mouth.”

ers of “Hanna’s neral Store” on

ered “the gu who shovels shit” by
black-tie sno s he’s run into. “I can
wear a coat and tie. I’ve got a tux,”
he protests. But despite everyone’s
efforts to spruce him up, he’s still the
fellow who shows up at “21” in New

York wearing a go shirt.

Laurie Lennard visited the Ohio
State Fair in August as a guest of
the Hannas. She found the e ri-
ence eyeopening. “Everybody—ticket
takers at toll booths and people at
the airport—everybod wanted his
autograph and wante to say hello.
It was like walkin around with
Warren Beatty.” Wil such adulation
spoil Jack Hanna? Will his celebrity
safari become an ego trip? Right
now those who seem to know him
well shout a resounding “No!” “I real-

ly believe him when he says he does ..

it for the zoo,” Lennard insists, and
adds, “I deal with people on ego trips
all the time.”

“You will seldom hear Jack Hanna
use the word ‘I,’ ” Dod e contends,
and board member Sic es says, “He
never asks for anything for Jack
Hanna.” Reporter Sharon Aber-
crombie echoes their sentiments:
“Motives are always a mixed bag.
But whatever he does, he does do for
the animals.”

And what does Jack Hanna say?

“The zoo is ﬁrst. If promotin Jack
Hanna promotes the zoo, I’ll o it.”

One gu he admires is David Let-
terman, cause he “operates the
show like I operate the zoo. The
Show is his life. He respects the peo-
ple he works with. He doesn’t go for
all the glamour of TV.”

Hanna still is a workaholic on be-
half of the zoo, as he was and proba-
bly always will be. “I don’t se arate
work from my personal 1' e,”- he
claims. Twenty-four hours a day he
carries a radio that keeps him in
touch with all sections of the zoo.
For rare summer mini-holidays he
retreats to one of the state parks.
“On Sunday night I can leave here at
10 o’clock, arrive at Deer Creek at
11:15, leave Monday ni ht or Tues-
day morning. And whi e I’m gone
Mel Dodge or somebody will call,
and later say, ‘How’s your vaca-
tion?’ ” Even he ﬁnds irony in the
fact that for him, such a small geta—
way is, indeed, a “vacation.” Anyone
meeting him can see that he is, as he
says, a “Type A” personality, who
burns like a Roman candle with in-
human and compulsive energy. “I
probably won’t last past 40,” he says
with grlsl good humor.

At 37, o h, he needs more time.
He just signelg another two-year con-
tract with the zoo board. He is work—
ing on a secret new publicity deal
that will throw all the others in the
shade, he implies. His Christmas list
of wants for the zoo is long, and in-
cludes a new a uarium, a tram sys-
tem, a bear exlu%it, a new aviary, an
upgraded North American animals
exhibit and — not least — the passage
of a .025 mill tax levy in November.

No, there’s still lots of future for
Jack Hanna. Emphatically, he in-
sists that it will be in Columbus.

“I swore I would never call any-
thing but Knoxville, Tennessee, my
home. But now I don’t even refer to
Knoxville—other than m accent. I
don’t want to go back t ere, ever.
This is my home now. I thought I’d
never, ever say that. The people
here have been so good to me, the
zoo, my family. I can never pay them
back. Id like to have a big party—but
there’d be almost 2,000 people. CI

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR - November 1, 1985

Canadian author Farley Mowat

Poetic plea for the environment by a writer bar red

 

 

By Cynthia B. Marquand

River Bourgeosis, Nova Scotia

Amid the rambling wild roses that border the
backyard of Canadian writer Farley Mowat stands a
vertebra of a whale. The luminescent bone protrudes
from the soil like an ancient relic, and on first glance
resembles an ethereal statue of a one-legged, bowing
ange .

It was 1972 when this world-renowned literary
spokesman for the wilds and his wife, Claire, found the
bone half buried in the sands of the Magdalen Islands.
They dug it up with their hands, and eventually placed
it by a pond here at their seaside summer home.

“It’s symbolic of the whales and what’s happened to
them,” says Mr. Mowat, who has written frequently on
the subject. On the west coast of Newfoundland, he
says, “half the beaches are whale bones.” And in Red
Bay, on the southern coast of Labrador, “the bottom of
the harbor is coated with whale bones.”

These are the remnants left behind by whaling crews
of bygone days that serve to remind him of the devasta-
tion man has wrought on this marine species that once
swarmed the oceans in profuse numbers. For Mowat, it
is also a warning of what may happen to all wild spe-
cies if adequate preservation measures are not taken
soon by world governments.

“What concerns me is the diminution of the remain-
ing populations [of animals] which are not yet officially
extinct, but who have been so reduced they are, in ef-
fect, either extinct or on their way to extinction,” he
says. .

“We are doing it worldwide, everywhere in the
world. We’re visiting a kind of mass destruction that
hasn’t been seen since the great die-off of the dinosaurs,
and maybe what we’re doing is even worse, even more
disastrous.” _

A recently published statistic by highly regarded en-

vironmentalist Norman Myers confirms that at the '

present rate of extinction, wewill see the loss of 50,000
species a year by the year 2000 (predominantly insects,
and not including plant species), and will be driving 130
species into extinction every day.

Mowat is one of his country’s most honored authors.
He has twice won the Governor General’s Award, the
most prestigious Canadian literary award. He is the re-
cipient of the Anisfield-Wolf Award for his contribu-
tions on interracial relations and was decorated with
the Order of Canada, the highest civilian honor. He is

also highly regarded by a wide range of environmental :

organizations.

“He’s admired in the sense that he has brought eco- ‘

logical issues to the public,” says Daniel Moses, edito-
rial director of Sierra Club Books.

Mowat’s environmental concerns run deep in his
writings. Most of his 28 books —- which he refers to as
“cause books” — are rife with Canadian imagery and
Arctic settings. They tussle with issues of endurance
and survival, draw upon the interconnectedness of life,
and highlight man’s compassion for and inhumanity to
his environment. They are poetic, palatable, humorous,
and often strikingly frank in their message. Perhaps
best known are his books “A Whale for the Killing”
and “Never Cry Wolf,” both of which were made into
films.

from the US

“Never Cry Wolf” was the first book ever written in
defense of the wolf, Mowat says. Published in 40 Ian-
guages, it even drew readers from the Soviet Umon.
Yet he laments that the book did little to raise con-
sciousness about the plight of this endangered species.

“As a species, it’s gone. And men continue to de-
stroy it without thought for what they’re domg, Simply
for selfish reasons.”

Then there is the Atlantic black right whale, which
numbers about 300.

“It’s an endangered species, and we spend a lot of
time and energy on it. And people go out and whale
watch in the Bay of Fundy to see a black right whale,”
he says. “Yet that animal is finished. Reproductively it
can never recover. In the 30 years since it’s been pro-
tected, the population has not increased.” . .

“There’s obviously no going back, there never is in
any evolutionary process. But we can change our atti-
tudes, we can move sideways, and agree to realize the
necessity for some kind of coexistence,” he adds.

A stout, impish man of Scottish descent, Mowat has
a quick wit and a ruddy, Rip van Winkle heard of
slightly orange tint. His brash, outspoken manner has

 

 

 

 

 

 

more than once branded him as a rabble-rouser. Yet be-
hind the roguish facade is an affable man With a kmdly

. demeanor and a compassionate heart. Seated by a pic-

ture window that opens to a misty Nova Scotia bay be-
low, he talks of his most recent pursuits.

“I am an observer of the natural world, and part of
it, and over the years I’ve been aware of the fact that
birds, animals, and fishes in this region -— the region in

which I live -— have become steadily scarcer. It came to i

l bother me, and finally I decided to investigate and see

' “The investigation led me into tortuous byways, and
I discovered that I was entering a cave of horrors. The
deeper I dug, the more I discovered. The destruction
that we have visited upon animal creation is absolutely,
incredibly large, huge, terrific, devastating. Devastat-
ing is the word.”

The, study led to his writing the book “Sea of
Slaughter,” published last April by Atlantic, to “ring

the bell” for environmentalists. It is his most serious _

and extensive -— yet least entertaining — work to date,
a work that required of him “five years of servitude.”

The only book of its kind, “Sea of Slaughter” re-cre-
ates the conditions of life on the Eastern Seaboard of
North America from the year 1500 to the present day.
As a documented case study, it includes grueling detail
of the massive destruction of wildlife in that area.
Mowat had a computer specialist run the raw data com-
piled in the book through a computer, and he found the
results astonishing.

“[The specialist] came up with the horrifying conclu-
sion that we, Western man, Western culture, have de-
stroyed between 80 and 90 percent of the biomass —
that is, the literal, physical volume of natural life on the
Atlantic seaboard, and the immediate adjacent
interior.”

 

 

 




The book cites, for example, the history of the East-
ern wood buffalo that roamed the woodlands of New
England and northeastern Canada. They were the larg-
est and most abundant herbivores in the eastern forest,
yet the entire population was destroyed by settlers. The
only records that verify this species’ existence come
from observations and journals of early explorers and
settlers who are quoted extensively in the book.

Mowat also notes that when settlers first arrived,
such anabundance of marine life existed that fish were
literally skimmed off the surface of the ocean. This food

 

 

 

 

 

source has so diminished today that some fish species
are no longer available in markets. Scallops will be un-
available to consumers in the near future if the present
overcatch continues, he predicts.

“Sea of Slaughter” also documents the virtual ex-
tinction of the Eskimo curlew, a bird so plentiful that
settlers randomly raised their muskets into the air to
bring down as many as a dozen with a single shot.

“It literally numbered in the tens of millions, maybe
hundreds of millions,” he says. “[Today], it is believed
by some biologists that there may be a dozen individ-
uals — maybe as many as 25 [left], but nobody
knows.” ‘

Mowat points out that recent grasshopper plagues in
the plains regions of the United States might be linked
in part to the extinction of the Eskimo curlew. Grass-
hOppers were the major part of the bird’s diet during its
migration over the plains region. Early settlers may not
have recognized the repercussions of their actions, says
Mowat, but today we can study their mistakes to avoid
creating further imbalances in the ecosystem.

‘ “We will inevitably destroy our underpinning if we
continue this way,” he warns. “We’re part of a life-sus-
taining structure, and we’re only one manifestation of
it. Destroy the structure, and we’ll go, too.”

As jarring as the message is, however, Mowat fails
to adequately mention in the book legislation enacted
over the last 15 years in defense of wildlife — such as
the US Marine Mammal Protection Act.

Last summer, Mowat was denied entry to the United ‘

States by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
when he attempted to cross the US-Canadian border on
a publicity tour for “Sea of Slaughter.” The INS cited
the McCarran-Walter Act as reason for the refusal.
(The McCarran-Walter Act was enacted in 1952, and
cites 33 categories of inadmissible persons, including
anarchists, communists, persons affiliated with com-
munist organizations, or anyone whose actions are con-
sidered “prejudicial to the public interest.” Under the
same act, the INS denied entry to Nobel Prize-winner
Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Italian playwright Dario F0,
South African poet Denis Brutus, and others. Former
Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau was
denied entry in 1954, when he was editor of a radical
Montreal magazine.)

The act is viewed by some as an infringement on

freedom of speech. Rep. Barney Frank (D) of Massa-
chusetts introduced a bill last year to revamp the
McCarran-Walter Act.

At the prompting of his publishers, the Atlantic
Monthly Press in the US and McClelland & Stewart
Ltd. in Canada, and with support from US and Cana-
dian news media, Mowat pressed the INS to specify the
reasons for his rejection. In his new book, “My Discov-
ery of America,” which was due out yesterday, he doc-
uments his ordeal. The book is a brief — though some-
times trivial —— 100-page synOpsis, liberally doused
with Mowat’s characteristic humor. After hearing a va-
riety of reasons for his rejection —— including alleged
communist affiliations and his firing of a .22 caliber ri-
fle at a US Strategic Air Command plane carrying hy-

 

drogen bombs —— hMowat concludes that the INS was
merely tossing a red herring in his path.

“They never produced any ev1dence at all that could
effectively explain why they stopped me, and why they
hadn’t stopped me before — I’d been gomg to the US
periodically for years. The story comes out 1n”the
book. It is directly related to ‘Sea of Slaughter, he
ex lains. ' .

I“The reason that I was stopped, despite the excuse
given, was that the anti-environmentalist lobby in
Washington, including the gun lobby and ,the sports
hunter lobby, did not warlits‘Sea of Slaughter to be pro-

andized b me in the .”

DagI‘he INS d3enies Mowat’s accusation. “I don’t know
of any connection like that,” says Duane Austin, press
officer for the INS. “We don’t critique books and de-
cide we don’t like them.” .

The reason for the denial “is not a matter of public
record,” he adds. _ .

Despite the controversy, envuonmentalists agree
that Mowat continues to play a key role in stemmmg
the diminution of endangered spec1es. .

. “He is such a lightning rod,” says Allen E. Smith,
president of Defenders of Wildlife. “No one W111 be able
to sweep endangered-species issues under the rug With
Farley Mowat around. I find that useful.

Dog lost for 4 months found -

LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) — A
small, 8-year-old dog that disap-
peared in a Florida thunderstorm
more than four months ago was
flying home to her owners Tuesday

after being found wandering near a.

Las Vegas casino.

“Its absolutely amazing,” said
Diane Long, who thought the fami-
ly’s beloved “Minnie Mouse” was
lost for good. “My husband loves
that dog more than anything in the
world. We can’t believe she’s safe.”

The Longs, who own a Daytona

Beach hardware store, had searched '

the city’s streets and shelters in vain
after Minnie escaped from the cou-
ple’s back yard during a thunder-
storm, while they were out having
dinner.

Several days ago, Las Vegas ani-
mal control officers contacted the

Long’s veterinarian with news the
dog had been found. The veterinar-
ian called Diane Long on Monday.

“I was absolutely dumbfounded
when I got the call,” she said. “We
really thought we would never see
her again.”

Billie Joe, an officer with the Las
Vegas animal control district, specu-
lated the dog had been picked up by
someone while wandering the
streets in Daytona Beach and driven
to Las Vegas. " .

“We found it about two weeks
ago running loose in the parking lot
of the El Cortez, one of the casinos,”
said Joe. “We kept it here thinking
the owners were in town on vacation
before we finally decided to trace
the tags.”

Diane Long said she also be-
lieved Minnie was taken by someone

to Las Vegas. ' .
“It’s the only way she 'could have

. gotten there,” she said of the mixed-

breeddog. “She certainly couldn’t
have walked there.” . ‘

- Long «said thedog was a favorite
of .‘her'husband, Dick, and had ac-
companied him daily' to work the
past six years at the hardware store.

“He told me yesterday when we
got the news that he always looked
at the place on the floor in the store
where she would lay,” she said.
“She’s just everybody’s favorite.
Everyone would come in and pick
her up and play with her.”

The dog was put on a cross-coun-
try jet Tuesday and Diane Long
made arrangements with airline

personnel in Atlanta to give her

water and let Minnie stretch her
legs.

finding out about hearing dogs
ﬁve years ago, the H.O.T. Dog
, Club has made it their mission
‘ to bring hearing dogs to Hous-
ton’s hearing—impaired.

“The idea of hearing dogs is
relatively new to the public,”
says Susan Pilkerton, of the
H.O.T. Dog Club. “It’s amaz-
ing to see one of these dogs
work. They’re trained to re
spond to things like the phone,
the doorbell, the teapot, the
alarm clock, a fire alarm, by
running back and forth from
the sound to their owner. The
dog paws and jumps up on the
owner until it gets a response.”
(For that reason hearing dogs
are usually much smaller than
seeing-eye dogs.)

“We’ve sponsored three of
the four hearing dogs in the
Houston area, working with
the organization in Denver,”
says Pilkerton. “They train the
dogs and screen the applica-
tions. We specify that our
funds go only for Houston-area
recipients.” It took about a
year to raise the money for
Sunshine, through events such
as informal dog shows, obedi-
ence training classes, even sell-
ing dog Christmas stockings
over the holidays. “A lot of
funds for hearing dogs come
from assisting at area dog
shows,” adds H.O.T. Dog Club
member George Anna Bobo.

 

“The Beaumont Kennel Club
paid us $500 for working their
show, because they know the
money will go to the hearing
dog fund.” “We already have
enough money now to sponsor
another dog,” Pilkerton says,
“but people still aren’t that
aware of hearing dogs yet, so
it’s hard to find eligible
recipients.”

Linda Sliva, of International
Hearing Dogs in Denver, ex-
plains that applicants “must
have at least 65 decibels hear-
ing loss, and there must not be
another hearing person over
the age of one in the house-
hold. Even very young children
quickly learn to be the parent’s
ears, and don’t understand that
the dog is doing that now.

“The dogs are just mixed
breeds from the animal
shelters here in Denver,” Sliva
says. “They range from 5 to
50 pounds, depending really on

Dogs attack schoolchild

Rottweilers overwhelm 5 boys

By WILLIAM C. BAYNE
and MARY POWERS

Three elementary school students re-
ceived treatment at Le Bonheur Children’s
Medical Center after being attacked by
dogs yesterday morning as the students
walked to a portable classroom.

The dogs are Rottweilers owned by
Gilbert Boney of 3431 Steve, which is
behind Sharpe Elementary School at 3431
Sharpe. Boney said the dogs were let out of
his fenced back yard by a child who was
teasing the dogs.

“They couldn’t get out on their own —
the gate opens from the outside and for
some reason this little boy opened the gate
and let them out,” said Boney.

Boney said the two dogs — each of which
weighs about 100 pounds — apparently
were out for about 45 minutes before they
encountered the three students. He said
only one of the dogs went after the
youngsters.

The three boys — Terrell Ware, Damien
Mattison and Patrick Rice, all 11 — were at-
tacked about 8245 am. as they were walking
to a portable classroom to pick up instru-
ments for a school Halloween program,
said Mary Willis, the school secretary.

Third-grade teacher Carolyn Cason said
she noticed two “fairly large” dogs on the

\/

portable classroom’s porch sniffing
around the door. The dogs left the porch
and began running toward the boys when
they spotted them rounding the corner of
the building, Ms. Cason said. She said the
boys had not been bothering the dogs.

She grabbed a chair and ran out of her
classroom to help. “By that time one had
bitten the boy in the leg and would not let
go,” she said. '

She said she yelled at the dogs and
threatened them with the chair. “It was
almost a hopeless situation,” Ms. Cason
said, adding that she was worried that she
would be bitten when one of the dogs
circled behind her. '-

Boney said he heard the ruckus outside
his home and ran toward the dogs, yelling
for them to stop. He said the two dogs —
Barkus, a 21/2-year-old male, and Raz, a 31/2-
year-old female — had one of the children
down as he approached.

“Raz wouldn’t do anything. She was just
Standing there, but Barkus had ahold of
the boy,” said Boney.

One dog backed off at Boney’s command,
but Ms. Cason said it took several more
commands from Boney to make the dog let
go of the student’s leg.

Shelter said the two Rottweilers
had been placed in an animal
clinic by Boney. Boney said the
dogs were being quarantined for
10 days to check for any diseases.

Len Grice of Le Bonheur said
Terrell Ware was the only child
injured seriously enough to be
held in the hospital for observa-
tion. He said Terrell was treated
for two abrasions on the left leg.

Damien Mattison, who had a
small abrasion on the leg, and
Patrick Rice, whose right palm
was bruised, were both treated
and released. Grice said the boys
“were shook up, but the injuries
were very minor.”

Boney was issued a misde-
meanor citation for allowing the
dogs to run loose, police said. He
also was cited by the Humane

Shelter for not having the dogs
vaccinated, a spokesman said.
Vincent Beard, a fifth-grader,
said the same dogs chased him
- a n d s o m 6
friends as they
gwalked to
school about
~ 7:45. They were
:. within several
‘ hundred yards
of school when
they saw the
dogs bothering
a girl. “The
.. _ garbage man
. made them
Vincent Beard (the dogs) get
out of the way,” Beard said.
Then the dogs headed for
Beard. “1 hit it with my book-
bag,” he said, adding he let go
when one dog grabbed the bag.
Beard said he got into a car

 

driven by another student’s
mother and rode the rest of the
way to school. The dogs ran off
with two school books, a note-
book and his homework, but
Beard was unhurt.

Ms. Cason said one of her
students had complained about
dogs chasing children yesterday
morning. Ms. Willis said she
sometimes sees dogs sniffing
around the school doors. '

“This is the first time a child
has been attacked,” she said.

Boney said he had raised the
dogs from puppies. “They had
never bitten anyone before. I’ve
never had any complaints from
the neighbors or anything. But a
neighbor told me that a boy had
provoked thedogs this morning
—— I don’t even know the little
boy’s name — and apparently let
them out."

Why just note that a child’s hair will

not his first golf ball? Now there’s a rational
reason to shoot a deer.

Since wildlife inspires and exhilarates
us, Guidry seems to feel that’s grounds for
capturing it and taking it home. I hope Gui-
dry never comes to dinner at my home. If
he enjoyed it, I might later find my silver-
ware plastered on a plaque over his fire-

Guidry further romanticizes the hunt by
claiming the hunter and poet both seek to
possess beauty.

The poet leaves beauty intact, even ex-
pands upon it and elevates us all.

the Fund relocated 4,000 Chi-
na Lake burros threatened
with extermination. In 1982,
the Navy shot and killed 681
burros there because some had
strayed onto a runway.

The Fund got a court order
to stop the killing and worked
out a settlement allowing the
relocation of the burros and
150 horses. Another 2,000
burros have been rescued by
the Fund from Death Valley
National Monument, Amory
said.

The US. Park Service had
considered the burros a nui-
sance at Death Valley also.

The burro rescues began in
1979. when the Fund trans-
ported 557 burros from the
Grand Canyon. The Park Ser-
vice had planned to shoot
them because, agents said,
they were eating endangered
plants.

After getting a court order
allowing the rescue, the Fund
deployed helicopters, pontoon
boats and cowboys to bring
the burros out.

Those burros, and the ones
at China Lake and Death Val-
ly, would have suffered brutal
deaths, Amory said. “They’re
very hard to kill with bullets,”
he explained, as he stroked the
neck of a tame. gray burro at

 

the ranch.

“I’ve seen some with 10 bul-
lets in them trying to die. You
have to shoot them in the
brain or heart to kill them
instantly.”

About 150 burros from
Death Valley were at the
ranch in October. A number
were due to be shipped out
soon to one of the 15 holding
areas in the country where
families can go to adopt them.
Two thousand more remain at
Death Valley, and the Fund is
negotiating for permission to
rescue them, Amory said.

Amory talks to and pets ev-
ery animal he meets. But it’s
clear that burros are a
favorite.

Whenever he’s at the ranch,
he makes a point of calling on
Friendly, 3 female burro so
named because she was the
ﬁrst burro to approach the
Fund’s rescuers in the Grand
Canyon. “She came up behind
me and nuzzled me,” Amory
said.

Friendly is not without a
sense of humor.“At the ranch,
I’d go out at night and look for
her,” Amory says, “and I’d
look and look and look. Nobo-
dy’d tell me. but she’d be fol-
lowing me all the time. When
I’d turn around, she’d turn

 

around behind me, knowing
full well I was looking for her.”

Except for a few special ani-
mals who will live out their
lives at the ranch, the burros,

pigs, goats and horses are

looking for homes with nice
people, Amory says.

The Fund has had quite a
bit of luck persuading people
that burros and goats are good
pets, he said. But the organi-
zation is careful about who
takes the wild horses. ,

“You can’t just let anyone
adopt a wild horse —-— it could
be dangerous,” Amory said.

The Fund is the ﬁrst organ-
ization to promote burros as
pets, he said. Thousands have

been adopted “and we’ve had \

only one case where it didn’t
work out.” Amory said.
Amory says burros have

 

been misunderstood and tak-
en for granted throughout his-
tory. He describes them as
“philosophical” animals.

“They will come to you like
a cat comes —— on their own
terms.”

About 10,000 burros have
been adopted from the Fund,
Amory said. They have been
popular among St. Louis area
residents, according to Mar-
garet Asproyerakas of Chica-
go. a spokesWornan for the
Fund. She said Missouri and
Illinois residents, including
several from farms just out-
side of St. Louis. have adopted
94 burros this year from a
holding area near Dorsey, Ill.

The holding area is at Ray-
mond Litzau’s six-acre farm.
Asproyerakas said more bur—
ros would be available for

 

adoption from the Litzau
farm next spring.

With the wild animal res-
cues continuing, it’s likely
that plenty of animals will be
grazing, running, playing and
otherwise enjoying themselves
at the ranch for some time to
come.

But just to make sure,
Amory is preparing to bring in
more permanent residents
next spring: about a dozen .
members of a prairie dog colo-
ny displaced by a development
in Colorado.

Concrete slabs will be
placed underground and a
fence erected above ground to
contain the colony, he said.
“It’s going to be expensive,
but it’ll be worth it,” Amory
said. “I’ve always wanted
prairie dogs here.” D

water as part of an Atlantic
City diving act; and four un-
named Shetland ponies.

The ponies and the mules
came to the ranch before Sax-
on’s time, and Amory could
not recall details of their
background.

“But I remember the ponies
were on their way to the
slaughterhouse when someone
brought them here,” Amory
said. “They were in such bad
shape that nobody else wanted
them.”

Like the ponies, most of the
600 animals living at the
ranch in October had been
rescued from slaughter. The
goats and pigs were taken
from San Clemente Island, off
San Diego, Calif. The Navy
uses the island as an artillery
practice range.

Navy officials said the ani-
mals were destroying the hab-
itats of endangered species on
the island. “They said the
goats were hurting certain
birds and lizards,” Amory
said. “Of course, they never
mentioned that the birds al-
ready were eating the lizards.”

 

The Navy “offered hunters
the chance to shoot the goats
and pigs, and we sprang into
action,”
Fund sued in 1978, and a set-
tlement was reached allowing
the group to rescue the ani-
mals. Late last year, the Navy
again complained about the
goats and threatened to allow
hunters to shoot them, Amory
said.

After renewed lobbying by
the Fund, Secretary of De-
fense Caspar W. Weinberger
gave the Fund time to conduct
anOther- rescue. About 1,500
goats and 300 wild pigs found
on the island have been res-
cued since January. Another
400 goats will be rescued this
winter, Amory said.

Fifty of the goats at the
ranch are the subject of an
experiment that eventually
may help prevent overpopula-
tion of wild animals, Amory
said. A chemo-sterilant that
inhibits reproduction was im—
planted last year on the necks
or ﬂanks of 25 female goats, he
ear

in the experiment were not
implanted. Those that were
implanted have not become
pregnant, Amory said and
some of those not implanted

Amory said. The '

The other 25 female goats

 

have had offspring.

The chemo-sterilant, which
contains anti- fertility hor-
mones, was developed by Dr.
U.S. Seal, a professor at the
University of Minnesota. It is
expected to cause infertility
for about three years. Amory
said that if the implant could
be improved to last longer, it
couldbeusedin deer and oth-
er animals that now are hunt-
ed for “population control”
purposes.

The implant research has '
been opposed by hunters, he
said. “Of course, they want to
continue hunting so they
don’t like it,” Amory said.
“They say, ‘What if someone
kills the animal and eats it?
They could be harmed by the

1mp.’lant

“We say, ‘Fine. That takes
care of two birds: the animal
and the hunter.’ ”

The goats not in the experi-
ment and the pigs are up for
adoption. Both groups “make
wonderful pets,” Amory in-

, sists. Saxon said the goats fre-

quently are adopted for brush
clearance projects.

The 75 wild horses at the
ranch were among those res-
cued from the China Lake Na-
val Weapons Center in Cali-
fornia, at the same time that

Before they became manag-
ers last year, the Saxons had
volunteered their help at the
ranch, they said.

“I’ve had animals ever since
.1 can remember,” Saxon says.
“All my life, I’ve had horses or
cows. If Daddy had something
he didn’t think would live,
he’d give it to me, and I’d take
care of it.”

Saxon is a favorite with the
animals, too. “Nim thinks
Billy belongs to him,” Amory
says.

Saxon’s ﬁrst stop during a
tour of the ranch one sunny
October morning is Nim’s
cage, a large structure that the
animal shares with a former
circus chimpanzee named Sal-
ly. Using sign language, Nim
tells Saxon that he wants a
slice of apple or orange, and

Saxon hands it over.

Occasionally, Nim demands
a kiss and gets that, too. After
the meal, Amory holds a mir-

ror so Nim can see himself

while he brushes his teeth.
“You never really’ know

whether he’s an animal or a

human,” says Mrs. Saxon.

 

 

“Just like all the other ‘ ani-
mals around here.” ,
Amory said that Nim was
reared in a university fraterni-
ty house and is famous among

 

psychologists for his “sign-
ing” ability. Nim came to the
ranch a few years ago after the
Fund learned that he was to be -
given to a medical research

 

laboratory in New York.

His right front knee joint is
held together by a steel plate
and a pin, and his leg curls
under him in a deep limp
when he moves. He can run
quite fast, however, and
Amory and Saxon say he
doesn’t seem to suffer any
pain.

“You can’t really test
whether a horse has pain. but
you can check him for signs of
stress,” Amory said. “We have
him checked regularly, and he
is not showing any stress.”

Cody was rescued in Octo-
ber 1984. by Martha Beneﬁeld
of Buchanan. Ga., after he was
shot by his owner, who lived
in Carroll County, Ga. Bene-
field said that the man shot
Cody with a .38-caliber re-
volver because the horse
wouldn’t come to him.

The Carroll County Sher-
iff’s Department refused to get
involved, and Benefield and a
friend picketed the depart-
ment, she said. Local newspa-
pers and a television station

publicized Cody’s story. and

money was raised to save him,
Beneﬁeld said.
The owner eventually sold

Cody for slaughter, but Bene-
field and the other donors
paid for his release. They sent
the horse to Auburn Universi-

ty in Auburn, Ala., where he .
received $3,000 in treatment

for the leg injury, she said.
Benefield said that only

$900 had been raised, and she .

feared Cody would be de-
stroyed if she couldn’t pay the
bill. “Then a friend showed

 

“She checked on Britches

take him.” 8 would

Britches gets along fairly
well with the horses and bur-
ros, but shies away from near-
ly everyone except the Saxons.
Amory thinks a lady friend
would make him more social.
“He really needs a compan-
ion.” .Amory said. “That’s
very important to animals
you know.” ’

Other animals who have
permanent homes at the
ranch include Peggy, a sweet
orange and white cat who lost
a front leg in a hunter’s trap;
Moe and Joe, two red mules
who were “cruelty cases.”

Nim’s owner was a profes-
sor at the University of Okla-

homa, Amory said, and the
Fund applied pressure on the
university to save Nim. “The
head of the university decided
it. wasn’t worth the bad pub-
licity, so he wasn’t sent to the
laboratory.” Amory said.

A member of the Fund do«

At A Ranch In Texas,

‘BLACK BEAUTY’
COMES TRUE

By Kathryn Rogers

so [have nothmgtofear andhere my'storyends. My troublesareallover, andI _
amathome.”

' — Black Beauty

HOUSANDS OF wild horses, burros and goats— threat-
ened with slaughter by the United States government —
have found solace and protection at Black Beauty Ranch
near Murchison, Tex.

Some have come to the 650 acres of rolling hills and
forests weary from the roundup or from trying to survive
in places like Death Valley. They have been fed, cared for
and then moved to holding areas across the country,
where families have adopted them as pets.

Publicity about their rescue from extermination has
focused national attention on the ranch, which is owned
by the Fund For Animals Inc. But, although always

welcome, the wild animals are not the reason Black Beauty Ranch came into being.

Author Cleveland Amory, head of the Fund, says the ranch is primarily a haven for
animals like the ﬁctional Black Beauty, the horse that suﬂ'ered years of mistreatment
before ﬁnding a pleasant home with lrind people.

The ranch, he says, is for Cody, a 14-year-old Tennessee walking horse shot in the leg
by his cruel owner and then sold for slaughter. 0r Britches, a shy, handsome llama, who
wasn’t properly cared for at the New England school he had gone to as a gift.

And Nim, an intelligent chimpanzee well-known in psychology circles, but destined
to spend his ﬁnal days as the subject of laboratory research on hepatitis.

“Asfarastconcerned, theycanspendtherestoftheiryears hereand neverdo
anything they don’t want to,” Amory said in a recent interview at the ranch. “Ever
since I was a kid and I read ‘Black Beauty,’ I’ve wanted something like this. ”

Nodding to a group of animals grazing peacefully near the entrance to the ranch,
tAhmory said: “They don’ t have the slightest idea that anything is going to happen to

em

“And it’s not.”

The Fund bought the ranch in 1979, a short time before the group’s famous wild
animal rescue programs began. The ranch costs a minimum of $100,000 a year to
operate, Amory says.

Ensearch Exploration Inc., which has oil drilling rights on the ranch property, pays
$25, 000 a year to the Fund for damage to land caused by the drilling. The remainder of

the ranch’s expenses, and the Fund’s annual budget of $15 million, come from
donations, Amory said.

The ranch is run by Bill and Lavada Saxon, animal lovers who formerly owned a
farm in nearby Ben Wheeler.

When Amory isn ’t poking fun at the Saxons’ Texas twang, he’s describing them as
godsends. “They are wonderful with animals,” he says. “Billy 1s absolutely fearless with
them.”

and the Bull Terrier.

“If you count all these dogs, they stand
close to third in the country in popularity. In
198:1 there were about 80,000 of them in the
Umted States. Twenty years 'ago they were
rarely seen in this country,” she said.

Thousands of them are properly bred show
dogs trained in obedience that are no more
vicious than any other kind of dog, she said.

But the pit bull’s muscular, dominant ap-
pearance has caused some of those animals to
be misused and misbred to be meanffby peo-
ple who want to be macho,” Nugentsaid.

“The problem is everybody today wants a

sai .
. Nugent said she believes some of the maul-
1ngs attributed to pit bulls actually involved
dogs that were only part pit bull or of some
other breeds entirely.

Maulings this year attributed to pit bull
dogs included an incident Saturday in Houston
where Raylene Smith, 43, and .her neighbor,
Frankie Trahan, 41, were attacked by two
dogs that had just finished killing a cat.

Smith underwent five hours of surgery for
her wounds following the incident. Trahan
was bitten but not as seriously injured. She
was released after treatment at Hermann
Hospital.

Houston police said the dogs, which appar-
ently escaped from the garage of a neighbor,
were shot to death after they threatened to
attack ambulance personnel trying to help the
injured women.

In Montgomery County, the county’s attor-
ney, Jim Dozier, has successfully prosecuted
the owner of a pit bulldog that killed 4—year-
old James Dwayne Miller in 1984. James Bry-
ant Traxler was found guilty of reckless be-
havior leading to the wrongful injury to a

child and was sentenced to 5 years in prison.

Dozier also is filing criminal negligence
charges against Kenneth Gillis whose bull ter-
rier mauled 4-year-old Miki Moyer of Conroe
in October.

~ Dozier said other reports of pit bull attacks
include one that “charged a child and an ani—
mal control officer" last week.

;A mail carrier attacked by a pit bull in the
east part of the county last year required
several stitches to close the wounds, Dozier
said. :

In Fort Bend County, 3-year-old Katy Barns
was bitten on Nov. 14.- by a pit bull r
walked into a neighbor’s unfenced yard iii
Rosenberg, said Homer Cauble, the city’s ani-
mal control officer.

.‘ The dog slashed the girl’s left cheek so se-

verely that it required about 50 stitches to

;‘.:close the wound, he said.

f9;;1’7'l‘he dog was placed under observation for

" , days "before it was destroyed with the
permission of the dogs’s owner, he said. ,

Cauble said he has encountered several oth-
er vicious pit bulldogs during his two years as
animal control officer.

 

About five months ago he shot a stray pit
bulldog on the street in “self-defense.”

“The dog was terrorizing a couple of fam-
ilies in the neighborhood. The people were
afraid to leave their homes.”

Last run-in Saturday

Cauble’s last run-in with a pit bulldog oc-
curred Saturday when he walked up to the
front door of a resident who had two pit bull-
dogs chained up in the south end of his un-
fenced front yard. -

“I made the mistake of watching only for
those two. Suddenly another one came in from
the north end of the yard and almost broke the
chain trying to get to me. I was making
tracks. He got within a foot of me” before
reaching the end of his chain, Caudle said.

In Galveston County this year, one pit bull
“tore part of a child’s ear off” and another
caused serious injury to a child’s eye, said Joe
Vickery, chief sanitarian for the county’s
health department.

Buffalo roam in Yellowstone,

By PATRICK OWENS

 

Newsday

GARDINER, Mont. — They run
tosize,withthemalesuptoaton,
the females half that. But they’re
also built for speed: A buffalo in a
hurry can out—dash a horse. There
were a great many of them (50
million is a conservative estimate)
spread from the Arctic to the Gulf
of Mexico and from Oregon to
Ohio.

Then they came under attack,
by hunters for their hides, by
country diners for their tongues,
by sportsmen for the pleasure of

{their slaughter.
“1 Social theorists of the time de-
‘ fended the killing.

“They are destroying the Indi-
ans’ commissary. . .. For the sake
of lasting peace, let them kill, skin
and sell until the buffaloes are ex-
terminated,” Gen. Phil Sheridan is
alleged to have said of hide hunt-
ers in 1875.

The Indians did not believe the
evidence of their eyes or of their
shrinking stomachs. The explana-
tion accepted in many tribes was
that the Great Spirit had called-
the buffalo home, into the same
hole in the ground from which
much of creation originally issued.
Bighee, as the Crow tribe called
the great beast, would return
when the white man took greed
back to wherever it was the white
man had come from. '

White men are still around all
the old buffalo grounds, but their
greed is moderated.

Far from facing extinction, bi-
shee thrive now as spectacle in
many zoos and in such grander set-
tings as the National Bison Range,
a federal reserve in northwest
Montana. They also are a meat
crop grown on hundreds of ranch-
es and farms, either purebred or as
beefalo, a cross with their cousin,
the cow. Some Western states evenf
pretend buffalo are game animals,
licensing citizens to hunt them.

In the area around Yellowstone
National Park, the animal is be-
coming all of the above, and then

some. The park’s bison injure tour- _

ists and threaten the cattle indus-
try with a ruinous disease called
brucellosis. In all, the genus raises
several questions about the philos-
ophy and style of the national
parks system, not to mention Yel-
loWstone’s neighbors.

. but

John Varley, Yellowstone’s re-
search administrator, said buffaloes
are by nature stolid, though sub-
ject to occasional alarm. “They ap-
pear to be tame animals because
they become very swiftly habituat-
ed ,to humans and human activity,”
he added. “But of course they are
not tame. These are wild ani-
mals. This is not Disneyland.”

In large measure, the bison has
replaced the bear as the sizable
park animal Yellowstone’s visitors
are most likely to encounter. Re-
strictions on feeding bears, along
with the closure of . open garbage
sites, largely have solved beggar-

’ bear problems that once plagued

several national parks. With the
bears back in the woods, earning

Twhat park workers like to call an
"honest living, the sort of people

who used to feed them are likely
nowadays to take photos of ' their
kinfolk with the buffalo.

“We have had people attempt to

put their children on the backs of ,

bison,” said Gary Brown, Yellow-
stone’s acting chief ranger, ex-
plaining the problem the buffaloes
have with people.

Jn the most usual script, the
tqu'nst with the camera urges his
wife. child or friend closer and
clbser to a great and hairy beast.

jVarley explains: “Every animal
has a critical distance that no one
can invade without provoking a re-
action. It might be eight feet for
one bison, for example. No one
knbws just what it is, but it is al-
wa there.”

_ ith those posing for shutter-
bugs, Varley says, “It’s, ‘Move
over!’ ‘Move over!’ and pretty soon
they’re in the critical distance of
' ,é bison. The animal takes two or
three steps and ducks his head
and. . . .”

fLast summer, at least 12 visitors
found themselves inside the critical
distance, and then on the horns.
One died.

gMelvin Dietz, 46, a machinist at
Littleton, Colo., scoffs at claims by
park officials that the human is in-
Variably the aggressor.

1‘ ~‘L‘We were first in the camp-
ground up in the morning, and I
went to the bathroom,” Dietz said
Of ‘..his encounter in June 1983.
“When I came out, I saw him. He

was right in the center of camp,
the camp circle. I went over that
my, about 25 or 30 feet from him,
and he took me. He picked me up
by. the leg, and it just pulled the
:ﬂesh right loose from the leg.
en, even though I was loose
’m the horn, my leg was caught
fj’t‘ween the horn and his head. It
gust pulled the flesh right off my
6.3-”
. jSome buffaloes have been de.
stroyed because of persistent anti-
social behavior. However, the pre-
vailing attitude within the park’s

bureaucracy has been best ex-
pressed by Tom Hobbs, until re-
cently chief ranger, when he noted
that it was the people, not the ani-
mals, who were guests in the
parks.

§ 0

However, it is when the buffa-
loos leave Yellowstone that the

park’s most serious bison manage-
ment issues arise.

This happens in winter and ear-

, ly spring, when the animals have
tmuble filling their stomachs from
the park’s limited meadowlands.
, Heading northwest out of Lamar
' Valley, some of the 700 bison in
‘ that herd have left Yellowstone
' each winter in recent years, mov-
ing onto private cattle pasturage
‘ and national forest woodlands in
Montana.

“They take out barbed-wire
fences as if they were no problem.
They go where they want to go,
and they can do a good deal of

" damage,” Varley acknowledges.

Ranchers and others involved in

j’ the buffalo wars describe such
, damage as a major irritation.
Frank Rigler, whose ranch is
*- among those invaded, adds that
buffalo and elk -— far more nu-
merous in number and also from
the park —.— can consume huge
quantities of grass and, when they
can get at it, hay, destroying pas-
, turelands in the process.
“They don’t leave you much to
I, make a living on,” Rigler said.
“They’ll eat sagebrush. They’ll eat
3 rubber rabbit brush. They’ll eat
anythmg‘ that’s there.”

But such problems pale before
the menace of brucellosis. Partial
toungulates—aclassofhoofed

 




animals that includes cattle, buffa;
lo and elk -— brucellosis has no ef-
fect on the quality of meat pro-
duced by its hosts. However, it
causes miscarriages, thus rendering
commercial cattle raising impracti-

cal. As undulant fever, it is a dis- ‘

abling affliction in humans.

Ridding the United States of ,. :; '1
brucellosis, then keeping it disease- .j

free, has been a major goal

for

many decades and tens of millions
of dollars have been spent in the
effort.

Cattle, buffalo and elk get along
fine socially. Buffalo and cattle are
interbred to produce the beefalo.
The fear is that cattle will pick up
brucellosis from intimate contact
with buffalo, from aborted buffalo
fetuses or from the waste of infect-
ed animals. .

“This is probably the biggest
reservoir of brucellosis that is left
in the United States,” Charles
Kane, president of the Wyoming
Stock Growers Association said last
summer. He called for a quaram
tine on Yellowstone buffalo and
posting of signs at park entrances
warning of the disease.

Park Supt. Robert Barbee dis-
missed Kane’s suggestions as “a

THE BUFFALO no longer is in danger of __
becoming extinct. The species' popula-
tion has increased so rapidly in Yellow-
stone Natlonal Park that some problems

hysterial approa .”

Varley said cattle never have
caught brucellosis from buffalo on
Open pasture, adding that there is
no evidence it can happen. His
qualification -- the mention of
open pasture — is apparently nec-
essary because, as Varley acknowl-
edges, cows have caught brucello-
sis from elk with which they were
penned experimentally.

Rigler disagrees. “I was just a
kid, but when the buffalo came
over here in the ’403, they brought
brucellosis with them, and our
cows caught it.”

Gallatin County was certified
brucellosis-free not long thereafter,

as was Montana, “an achievement

that cost millions of dollars.

V arley contends that concern

about buffalo spreading the disease

is a result not of valid fears by__

stockmen but of agitations by state
and federal veterinarians

Donald Ferlicka, Montana’s state
veterinarian, takes a firm position.
“If you were a Montana rancher,
you would have already been is-
sued an order of quarantine, and it
would be expected that you’d take
charge of your livestock and keep
them from mingling with cattle of
other ownership or otherwise be-
coming a risk to human welfare,”
he told Barbee in a letter.

The solution for the park, Fer-
licka said, is to vaccinate its buffalo
while eliminating the infected ani-
mals. Barbee has rejected this ad-
vice, saying it is impractical and a
violation of Yellowstone’s philoso-
phy of letting nature take its
course.

 

Associated Press

have developed. Several tourists have
been attacked by the huge beasts, and
park officials are reminding people that
buffaloes are wild animals. *

as to practicality, Varley esti-
mated that 85 percent of'all pﬁk
buffaloes would have to be slam-
tered. Even this sacrifice no deubt
would prove ineffective, he said,
because the buffalo could be ex-
pected to be reinfected -- by the
park's many elk.

Last winter, a cold one, buffa-
loes in unusual numbers moved
into Montana. State game war-
dens, acting as agents of the state
vetemarian, gunned down 68 buf-
faloes that declined to be herded
home.

With tensions increasing, the
Montana Legislature got into the
act, decreeing a special hunting
season. The state Fish and Game
Commission opposed the idea, and
Ferlicka describes it as an invita-
tion to disaster.

In N orthbrook court, pet owners
ﬁght just like, well, cats and dogs

By Barbara Brotman

In this courtroom, the accused
rarely speak in their own de-
fense. This is not because they
fear self-incrimination, but be-
cause they are, for the most
part, dogs.

They have been brought to jus—
tice before the Northbrook Ani-
mal Control Commission, which
administers the suburb’s animal-
control laws. The commission
holds hearings on charges that
their owners have allowed them
to run out of control, de'posit
waste unlawfully and bark ex-
cessively.

The latter charge is the most
common and is, chairman Susan
Gordon concedes, difficult to de-
fine. She has told complainants
that the commission must sepa-
rate fact from emotion in such
cases. _

On this night, a white German

shepherd named Jack stands ac-
cused of ripping the stake an-
choring his chain out of the
ground and attacking Kimberly
Kavooras’ Old English Sheepdog,
Plato.

The German shepherd is ap-
parently a repeat offender, its
owners having been sentenced in
Cook County Circuit Court to a
year’s supervision for allowing
Jack to cross the street and lick
Plato.

Jack’s owners, Don and Shir-
ley Stekham, testify first.

“Miss Kavooras takes the dog
across the street to go potty and
lingers, and walks back and
forth and antagonizes Jack,”
Mrs. Stekham states.

“She walks with the pooper-

scooper, but she does not pick it
up. She throws it in the bushes
and wipes the soooper off in the
leaves.”

Commission vice chairman
Harriette Gordon informs Mrs.
Stekham that Plato’s personal
habits are not at issue. '

Don Stekham testifies that
Plato is sometimes walked di—
rectly in front of the Stekham
property, antagonizing Jack.

“It’s a lie,” answers Kavooras
from her seat.

Kavooras testifies that Jack
attacks Plato without provocat-
ion. Recently, however, she has
been walking Plato on another
street entirely. This has appar-
ently solved the problem, and
the commission rules that any
future incident be referred to the

ing a line of encouragement to “not

“Let’s use this wonderful appor-

with a court order requiring them
to move their animals from an. 8-

“We will certainly examine it to

Mumford said. “They obviously

Abe Sharoney, attorney for the

A female wolf pup is returned to Racine zoo.
—-AP laserphofo

Officials hope
food will lure
wolves back

RACINE (AP) - Officials at the
Racine Zoological Gardens said
Friday they hoped to lure back two
escaped timber wolf pups with food.

“They should be getting hungry
pretty quick,” said head zookeeper
Don Bendix.

The cubs were among seven that
escaped Wednesday night, apparently
after gnawing a hole in the fence
around their own pen and then getting
out of the zoo grounds through holes
under the fence.

Three of the wolves were recap-
tured Thursday, a fourth was taken to
a veterinarian after apparently being
hit by a car, and a fifth was shot dead
by police officers.

Zoo Director Louis Rhoades said
the three pups back at the zoo were
scared following the experience.

“They don’t know what’s happened
to them,” he said.

Rhoades said the wolves, 6 months
old and weighing about 45 pounds,
presented no danger to people under
normal circumstances.

“But they are wild animals. If they
are cornered they might be danger-
ous,” he said.

Chuck Pils, a specialist on furbear-
ing animals for the Wisconsin Depart-
ment of Natural Resources, said the
wolves on the loose undoubtedly
faced much more danger to them-
selves than the public faced from
them. He said the animals would be
terrified of people and unlikely to go
near them.

By Jim Broede

t. Paul, Minn—Jake, a

furry-as-a-bear shepherd mix

dog, has a fighting chance to

celebrate his 10th birthday
next July.

The credit goes to advances in
veterinary medicine and a devoted
owner willing to pick up the $3,000
tab to keep him alive.

Jake easily could have died

Instead, he ambles around the
Jerry Rademacher home in
Roseville, Minn, with the help of
an artificial hip.

Until 10 years ago, it was tan-
tamount to a death sentence.

“Now there’s hope,”
Rademacher said. “Veterinarians
at the University of Minnesota put
artificial hips into dogs all the
time. I took Jake over for an
examination.”

Jake was a suitable candidate
for a new hip.

The $850 cost and almost two
months of owner-supervised reha-
bilitative care might have turned
off some, but not Rademacher and
his wife, Margarita. -

“Jake always gets tender loving
care at home,” Rademacher said.

: “In some ways, we treat him like
" the child we never had.”

For three weeks following sur-
gery, Jake had around-the-clock

. attention.

“We took turns watching his

3? every move,” Rademacher said.
:1 “We wanted to do everything P05‘
2' sible to ensure a full reooveI'Y-”

For four additional weeks, Jake

, remained on a tight leash.

“Finally, we let him go,”

-' Rademacher said. “He was agile.

The new hip worked beautifully. I
started saving for another opera-
tion to replace the other hip.”

Like Jake, Sherry is family at
the Mary Lou Ramberg home in .
International Falls, Minn. ~
- “I thought she was going to die,”
Ramberg said of her 10-year-old
German schnauzer. “She was
hardly breathing.”

Sherry, who had an ailing heart
that sometimes slowed from the
normal 60 to 100 beats a minute to
only 15 beats, collapsed and went
into seizures.

A local veterinarian recommend-
ed implant of a pacemaker, the

kind used in humans, to stimulate.

and regulate the heart.

“I never hesitated,” Ramberg
said. “I’d spare no effort, no cost
to save Sherry’s life.”

In July, the pacemaker was im-

planted at the University of Wis-
consm’s School of Veterinary Med-
wine.

“The improvement in She ’5
health was dramatic,” Ramlbresrg
said. “Now she’s full of you-know-

ou ve er year-old] father,
Whiskey.”

The cost of saving She ’5 life
was $192 for the pacemakxesr and

$348 for the doctor and hospital
fees.

At the University of Minnesota,
veterinarians identify about six to
eight dogs a year as “good can-

didates” for heart pacemakers,

said Dr. Phillip Ogburn, associate

professor of cardiology.

Occasionally, the pacemakers

are implanted in cows and horses
usually for temporary use after ’

heart-strainin sur e f
maladies, 8 8 IV or other

“Most owners choose not to have

the implant done, even though it

might extend their pets’ lives by
four or five years,” Ogbum said.
“For some, the $500 cost is prohibi-
tive.”

At the University of Pennsylva- '
nia, a pacemaker was recently
implanted in a race horse.

“The owner has no intent of
racing the horse anymore,” Og-
burn said. “Instead, he wants to
keep the horse alive for breeding
purposes.”

Staying alive was no problem for
Megan, a 4-year-old Old English
Sheepdog.

“Megan was in good health, but
she couldn’t see,” said owner
Nancy Gosselin of St. Louis Park,
Minn. “She had cataracts on both
eyes.”

Gosselin fretted over the thought
of Megan going through life blind.
But to her delight, she learned that
at the University of Minnesota,
ammals routinely undergo opera-
tions for removal of cataracts, just

like in humans.

In a typical week, two or three
'dogs will have the operations,
which cost about $300, said Dr.
Stephen Bistner, professor of
veterinary medicine.

Megan went in for her operation
last April.

“It couldn’t have gone better,”
Gosselin said. “When Megan looks
out the window and reacts to what
she sees; it brings a lump to my
throat.”

Linus, another Old English
Sheepdog, had more than a lump
in his throat.

It was a cancerous tumor, big as
a grapefruit, wrapped around his
esophagus.

A few years ago, owner Joyce
Winnick of Forest Lake, Minn,
probably would have shed some
tears and had Linus mercifuny put
to sleep.

Today, Winnick, would go to the
veterinarians at the University of
Minnesota and seek chemotherapy
for the dog.

Linus would have company—~15
to 20 other dogs receiving
chemotherapy and radiation treat-
ment for cancer on any given day.

The doctors there say they see
increasing numbers of pets with
cancer, because veterinary medi-
cine helped them live long enough
to be afﬂicted with the diseases of
old age.

“For a while, the chemotherapy
worked,” Winnick said. “The
tumor almost disappeared. Linus
came home after 10 days and lead!
a pain-free life for an additional
seven months.”

Eventually, the cancer spread
and Winnick had to bid a tearful
farewell to her 12—year—old pet.

The cost for the chemotherapy
was $1,500.

“We bought Linus some extra
time,” Winnick said. “I’d do it
again just to have one of my pets
around a little bit longer.”

A lifetime is stealing
by on little cat feet

11 envelope has been delivered to this

office. Inside the envelope was a long

note from Mike Holiday, a bag boy at the

Treasure Island supermarket on Wells
Street and author of the best-selling novel
“Bagtime.” Here are the contents of Mike
Holiday‘s message:

Helen’s getting old. That occurred to me for
the first time tonight, just after I finished my
shift at the Treasure Island. It had been a slow
evening, and I hung up my apron and burned
across Wells Street to my apartment above That
Steak Joynt.

I slid the key into the lock, opened the door
and walked inside. For a moment I didn’t realize
what it was that seemed wrong, and then I
understood. Helen wasn’t standing by the door.

I went into the bedroom; there was Helen,
curled up on the blanket at the foot of the bed,
asleep. There was a time when I couldn’t come
home without Helen running to the front door to
greet me; no matter where she was in the .
apartment, she would recogmze my footsteps 1n
the hallway and scamper to the door so that
she’d be there when I walked in. As soon as I
would open the door a crack, she’d stick her nose
out—my ankles would bump into her on my way
inside. _ _

Now, as often as not, she sleeps right through
my homecoming. I’ve got to wake her up to feed
her, which 1 did tonight» I gently rubbed my

hand over her back, and she started to purr, and ’

then to twitch her whiskers, and then she was
awake. .

She’s pretty old for a cat; almost 15. I have to
keep reminding myself of that. One of these days
she’s not going to be here, and my hfe Will sure
be different.

It seems that everything that has happened to
me during my years in Chicago, Helenhas been
a part of. When I first moved to town, right after
graduating fromthe U. of 1., Chay and I adopted

her. Chay and .al werounewlyweds atthe time} . "

and we thought it [would be nice to have a pet.
Little did I know that Helen would be a part of
my life far longer than Chay would.

I still remember those early days of our
marriage—Chay cooking us dinner, and Helen
roaming around on the floor underneath the
table, me talking about how nice the people were
at the Treasure Island and how being a bag boy
seemed like a good enough job until something
real came along. Even then I guess I subcon-
sciously realized that Chay knew I was fooling
myself; she would never say anything when I
talked about life beyond the Treasure Island. She
knew I was there to stay.

After Chay divorced me and moved away from
town, it was juSt Helen and me in the apartment.
The ’705 was such a strange decade—I would
meet women in the supermarket or in the bars
around Wells Street and North Avenue, and once
in a while I would bring one of them home with
me, and Helen would look up at me almost in a
reprimanding manner: like she was glad that I
had company, but that she had preferred it when
Chay was there. Now, almost all of the time, I
come home alone; I value my privacy more than
I used to, I guess. If Helen even remembers

. Chay, she doesn’t show a sign of it.

It’s funny how all of my memories of Chicago
will be shaped by that cat. All of those mornings
getting ready to go to work; I would go into the
bathroom to shave, and I would cradle Helen in
one arm while I shaved with the other hand. The
Water would be running, and the .mirror would
be steamed up, and I could hear the muffled
sound of the traffic out on the street. It was the
one moment of the day that gave a little
symmetry to my lifeT—I didn’t know what was
going to happen between then and nightfall, but I
knew that I would start off every day shaving
while Helen watched.

We don’t do that much anymore; Helen’s
sleeping later now, and often I will be careful not
to disturb her—-I’ll shave by myself, and get
dressed, and leave food and water for her. When
I get home, like tonight, she may be asleep.
People ask me if I have a pet, and I have to
think twice before I answer that question. It’s
been a long time since I considered Helen as a
pet. She’s much more like a friend. .

So there we were tonight—me heating up the
stove for my dinner, Helen shaking herself
awake and eating her own dinner. I used to ball
up my socks and play fetch with her—Helen is
the only cat I’ve ever known who fetches things
‘the same way a dog does. But she’s lost interest;
I found that out a couple of months ago when I
tossed a sock across the room and she didn’t
even follow it with her eyes. '

A man starts to wonder about his life—here I
am, still a bag boy at the TI, still living in the
apartment, still falling asleep with Helen at the
foot of the bed every night. I guess I hadn’t
thought much about what it’s going to be like
when she’s not here any longer, but I’d better
start. Nothing is forever, and one of these days
it’ll just be me. You start to think things are

.permanent, but they never are.

Value of cats, dogs and horses '
keeps them off the dinner table

GAINESVILLE (UPI) — We fi-
nally know why Americans don’t eat
their dogs, cats and horses.

“These animals are just too
darned useful to go around eating
them,” University of Florida anthro-
pologist and graduate research Pro-
fessor Marvin Harris said Tuesday.

"Dogs, cats and horses would not
have been domesticated were it not
for the services they rendered in
hunting, protection of property, ro-
dent control, transportation and war-
fare,” Harris said. _

Besides, said Harris, people talk
to these animals — and how can you
butcher a creature that cuddles up
to you, laps at your fingers and lis-
tens to your problems?

“They can entertain us like .

stand-up comedians, educate us like
gym coaches, relax us like wives or
husbands, love us like children, lis-
ten tous like psychiatrists, confess

CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER

. A University of Florida
expert says the most
important role of pets
in our society is
companionship.

 

- us like priests and heal us like physi-

cians —— all for a few hundred dol-
lars a year,” Harris said.

“Modern day household pets
can’t match the entertainment value
of lions attacking elephants or peo-
ple in- the Roman circus,” Harris
said. “But cats chasing imaginary
mice or dogs retrieving'bouncing
balls is at least as amusing as the
late night movie.”

Harris said many parents keep
pets to educate their children about

“the facts of life” —— pregnancy, bir- '

thing and death. >
But the most important role pets

. fill in our society is that of compan-

ion, Harris said. He called modern
pets “proxy humans” who compen-
sate for unsatisfactory human rela-
tionships.

“The companionship value of all
kinds of pets provides the key to
their ever growing popularity in in-
dustrial society,” Harris said.

That’s not so everywhere, Harris
said, because some other cultures
consider dogs as tasty delicacies.

“Virtually all Polynesian dogs
ended their lives as part of a human
meal,” Harris said. “What prevented .
the dog from becoming as much a 1
pet in Polynesia as in Europe was its
importance as a source of food.”

Americans have so many more
and better food sources that they
don’t need dogs for eating, Harris
said.

SEA WORLD TRAINER HAIlS THE
ARRIVALOF A NEWBORN WHALE'

RLANDO —- The

whales were restless at

Sea World when a
350-pound newborn first
popped in last month to share
their tank.

Not that they didn’t wel-
come the bouncing black-and-
white miniature version of
themselves. But the baby killer
whale had this habit of rousing
her napping elders whenever
it was time to search out her
mother, Kandu, to nurse.

Baby Shamu, named after
her father, arrived in Septem-
ber and is the only killer whale
born in any of Sea World’s
three marine life parks and the
first to nurse in captivity and
survrve.

The <3" was 6 feet long at
birth. A ready she’s grown
more than another foot and
put on a whopping 250
pounds .

Shamu may be the pater-
nal link. But the fellow who
acts even more like the
whale’s proud father is Dave
Butcher, whale trainer and
corporate director of animal
behavior for Sea World.

“We are watching man
step on the moon here," says
Butcher, his brown eyes scan-
ning the water as the baby
whale swims past. ”No one has
ever seen this.”

Just after the whale calf
was born, she swam in a
straight-ahead pattern while
the big animals dove and
twisted and turned for their
routine workouts.

Now, like a windu toy in
her 5 million-gallon Bathtub,
Baby Shamu swims Tupside
down, takes small leaps out of
the water and has begun to try
out her high-pitched whistle.

“Look at thei caHL”
Butcher says, jumping from a
bleacher in Shamu Stadium
and grabbing a visitor’s arm.
”She’s really playing! It’s al-
most like she’s starting to ven-
ture out on the streets and
cross the road by herself.”

The baby whale seems ob-
livious to the tourists in their
bermuda shorts and Mickey
Mouse ears as they press their
noses a ainst the side of the
tank an§ peer into the aqua-
marine water, hugging stuf ed-
animal versions of the slippery
giants.

When the show starts and
the Sea World trainers swrm
with and direct the grown
whales in their act, ”she s
more interested in what we
and the whales are doing than
what the audience is doin ,"
says Butcher. And she snugg es

 

up to her mom for a quick

meal between stunts.

Before the calf was born,

Butcher and other Sea World
officials weren’t sure how Its
mother would react to her
offspring. .
In t e wild, oung marine
mammals often ave a tough
time surviving because their
mothers are confused by nurs-
ing attem ts, studies show.

So when Kandu reached
her final months of pregnancy,
Butcher, who works with the
killer whales daily, ave her a
crash course on w at to ex-
pect when the calf would try
to nurse.

First, he'd touch her pec-
toral fin, then gently touch her

mammaries, offering a handful
of fish, a pat on the head or
some other reward. ,

”We didn’t know what the
touch of the baby would be
like, so we didn’t know how to
train for that,” he says.

He also trained Shamu and
the third adult whale, Namu,
to swim over and touch her in
a similar way. The mother-
to-be didn’t mind at all.

“She was excited about it
because it was a learning proc-
ess," Butcher says.

And that suited Kandu’s
personality, Butcher says, be-
cause the 10-year-old,
5,000-pc5und mama whale
”likes to learn. She's interested
in the complexities of learn-
mg.”

Shamu, on the other hand,
refers to be macho and per-
orm athletic, showy tasks, like

a simple high jump.

Namu, a sleepy whale,
spends a lot of time hanging
on the edge of the 36-foot-
deep tank in a semi-doze.
When she's awake, she wants
nothing more than affection.

”i can hu and kiss her all
day long an she’d love it,"
Butcher says.

Some folks question the
wisdom of keeping these
whales in captivity. ,

”People say, ’How do you
know they1 like it? Why don’t
you give t ese guys a break?,”’
sa 5 Butcher. ’But does the
w ale look like she’s totally
stressed out?," he asks, swee -
ing his arm toward the stil-
napping Namu. ”They love it.”

It would be “absurd,” he
sa 5, to free the Sea World
w ales, ”because we’re learn-
ing from these animals.”

When Butcher, 33, first
signed on at Sea World’s San
Diego park 13 years a o, sev-
eral trainers resigned ecause
they'd been intimidated by the

aggressive mammals.

 

Butcher himself has been
yanked to the bottom of the
ool and bitten b a whale,
ut he says the whales were
nasty only because the were
bored with the pre ictable
training schedule and didn’t
know what to think of their
human teachers.

Killer whales, known sci-
entifically by the name Orci-
nus orca, are considered
among the smartest of more
than 75 different cetaceans,
the order of aquatic mammals
that includes dolphins and
porpoises.

"’They are the top of the
predatory chain. They can
um and kill anything they
want. When these guys 0 out
and play, they pla roug , and
we can’t play tat rough,”
Butcher says.

Rather than unish the an-
imals b withholdin food
when they didn’t iehave,
Butcher, who .became head
trainer, developed a training
technique that rewarded the
marine mammals with some- ‘
thing different each time —— a '
toy, a rubdown, a hug and
sometimes fish. '

The whales were moti-
vated, he says, because they
had something to look forward
to. By the end of 1974, they
were allowing their trainers to
jump on their backs for a ride.

“Animals teach me some-
thing that’s important to me,

and that’s every individual, re-

ardless of species, needs
ugs, understanding, apprecia-
tion and attention,” he says.

Dog That Escaped
. Execution Is Near

y

Death Once More

By Steve Rubenstein

.. Sido, the only dog to over-
turn her own death sentence, is
{fighting for her life again.

,.../‘This time her opponent is not
the law, but old age.

And this time, even the talent-
ed stable of San Francisco SPCA
attorneys and veterinarians may be
unable to save her.

3,

, “There is a good possibility that
her end is near,” said Richard Avan-
zino, president of the San Francisco
Society for the Prevention of Cruel-
ty to Animals, as he stood by his
dog’s side in the emergency room.

He was sobbing. Sido lay with
her eyes closed and her tail droop-
ing. Doctors said the mixed-breed
dog was in critical condition.

It was in 1979 that Sido padded
into the hearts of San Francisco,
after her first owner had died. The
woman, in her will, had feared that
no one couldbe found to take care
of her pet, and specified that Sido
be destroyed.

The SPCA fought. that decree in
the courts and before the California
Legislature. Six months later, the
governor signed a law forbidding
owners from condemning pets to
death in their wills. Sido was given a
warm welcome at City Hall, and
Avanzino made the dog a member
of his own family.

Yesterday was the famous
dog’s 16th birthday. Hundreds of
well-wishers had been invited to a
party in her honor at SPCA head-
quarters in the Mission District. It
was a strange day to fall critically
ill, but Sido always did have a keen

from fainting spells brought on by
old age. Yesterday, shortly after her
morning walk, she collapsed on the
kitchen floor. Avanzino took her to
the SPCA hospital.

For hours, Sido held her own,
wagging her tail in her corner cage
and licking Avanzino’s hand during
his many visits.

About 3 pm, veterinarian Jack
Aldridge lifted her onto the examin-
ing table to see is she were fit to
make a brief appearance at the par-
ty. It was then that Sido gasped and
teppled over. Her heart had stopped
beating.

Aldridge managed to revive
her, but said the “prognosis is poor.”

“She’s taken a nose dive,” he
said. “The reasons are well beyond
me. Perhaps she has decided she
just does not wish to stay around.”

Avanzino, who keeps five pets
at home and four more in the office,
was trying to fight back tears and
not succeeding.

“She’s the grande dame of the

SPCA,” he said. “She’s got elegance, f

stature. A real presence.”

For six years, Avanzino said, Si-
do has been “my companion, play-
mate and lover.” He said Sido has

accompanied him to work .. every .
day and become particularly adept i
at comforting other animals at the ‘
pound, especially those brought in,

for neutering.

“She seems to have a way of
telling the other animals that every-
thing’s going to be all right, that
they’re among friends,” Avanzino
said.

long and .much loved photographed walks

An era has passed. '

But few doubt that a replacement will be
found. At the top of French political life, a
labrador is de rigueur. Former president
Valery Giscard d’Estaing had one, given to
him by the Queen, which is called Jugurtha
and which he speaks to in English.

Jacques Chirac, the ambitious mayor of
Paris and former premier, keeps one at his
country house in the Correze. Perhaps it
was the innate confidence of the labrador
owner that led him to describe the present
prime minister, Laurent Fabius. during a
recent face-to-face on ' television as a
“roquel or snapping terrier. ‘

wrested the title of Europe’s greatest
animal lovers from theBritish. There are
33m pets in France and the resultant
industry is turning over £25 billion a year.

Many theories are put forward for the
explosive growth in dog ownership. The low
human birth rate leads to the use of animal
substitutes by childless couples. Fear of
violence leads people to buy guard dogs like
the Alsatian. the most popular breed, and
the ”bait/(’dogm’". , ~,

There is also the psychologicalattach-
ment of the French to the land, which the
family mutt represents. “The peasant who
came to Paris in the 19505 didn’t want any
animals,“ says Dr Jean Pommery, a vet.

'“They reminded him of where he came.

his children who miss animals and who
keep them." - '

Demand is great enough for 70,000
clandestine canines to immigrate illegally
from Belgium and Holland each year,
kitted out with false pedigree papers and
vaccination certificates. 1

The French brought their own sense of
style to dog owning. Salons provide beauty
sessions for “le Yorkshire” or “le Cocker”
for £22 a throw. Holiday homes, at £18 a
day. provide soothing tapes of the absent
master‘s voice, and Indian and classical
music, which tranquillise the canine ear.
Private health care schemes are available
for an annual £25 premium. I '

And, when it is time to go to the great
kennel in the sky, the departed can be
cremated and the ashes scattered in the sea

HARRISBURG, PA PATRIOT—NEWS - Nov. 10, 1985

Number of rabies cases likely

By Dick Sarge
§unhag Butrint-Ncms

The number of rabies cases reported in
Pennsylvania this year is expected to set a
record, state officials say. ’

Dr. Bobby Jones, state Department of
Health epidemiologist, said 363 confirmed
cases of rabies in animals had been report-
ed through Wednesday. The disease was
found in 231 raccoons, 59 skunks, 45 bats
and 10 other species in 30 counties, he
said.

Among the reported incidents, only
three cats and two dogs had contracted
rabies, an indication that vaccinations for
pets are effective, according to Jones.

Health Department spokesman Bruce
Reimer said last year’s 384 cases undoubt~
edly will be exceeded, and the disease
probably will continue to spread.

MORE THAN two-thirds of the rabies
cases this year are concentrated in five
midstate counties: Adams. 80: Cumber-

1736“, 76; York, 38; Perry, 34; and Centre,

In Cumberland County, 27 rabies cas-
es had been reported through June and 49
since, increasing from an average of 4.5 to
l 1.5 cases a month, Jones said.

Adams County had 42 cases in the first
six months of this year, an average of six
a month. But there were 38 cases in the
next four months, an average of nine 3
month. ‘

In the same six-month period, York
County reported new cases at an average
of 1.3 a month, but that number has in-
creased to seven a month since June. Per-
ry County had a rate through June of 1.5
cases each month that has jumped to six
reports a month going into November.

JONES SAID many wild animal
deaths from rabies go uncounted. And
since the initial excitement over the out-
break has abated, game protectors and
residents in. areas of high rates have been
disposing of diseased animals without

bringing their heads to the laboratory at
Summerdale to be confirmed as rabies
carriers, Jones said.

The Health Department continues to
caution that contact with wild animals
should be avoided, domestic animals
should be vaccinated and suspected expo-
sure should be treated promptly. Once ra-
bies symptoms appear in humans. there’s
no way to cure the disease, Jones said.

The epidemic entered the state from
Maryland in 1981 and has continued fann-
ing out wedgelike in a northeasterly die
rection. -

Some westward movement into
southwestern Juniata County’s Tuscarora
Valley from western Perry County has
been seen recently. The likely point of

- passage appears to be through the Horse

Valley Run or Laurel Run gaps in Tus-
carora Mountain.

RABIES HAS been confirmed in rac-
coons in the East Waterford. Honey Grove
and Port Royal areas. But the Susquehana

na River and higher mountain ridges con-
tinue to serve as natural barriers to the
migration of rabid raccoons and skunks
out of the southcentral region.

Although the Juniata River apparently
has been crossed once by a rabid raccoon
in the Millerstown area, four other rabid
raccoons in the area all were found south
of the river. A Health Department epi-
demiologist said she believes the one inci-
dent to the north was an isolated case.

Rabid animals also have been found in
the Newport area of lower Perry County,
but no cases have been reported on the
Juniata River’s north side.

Rabid raccoons and a few skunks have
been confirmed at the western edge of the
Susquehanna around Goldsboro, New
Cumberland, East Pennsboro TWp.,
Wormleysburg and Enola on the West
Shore. But Dauphin, Lancaster and Leba-
non counties across the river have not
been invaded by the raccoon strain, offi-
cials said.

DAUPHIN COUNTY so far this year
has not had a single case of rabies in ani-
mals. But a rabid bat and squirrel were
found in Lebanon County,_ and a rabid bat
in Lancaster County.

The number of rabies cases so far this
year is 43 ahead of the same period last
year, which ended with 384 cases, the
greatest number since a rabies epidemic
swept the dog population in 1942.

Last year there were 134 rabies cases -
reported in the first six months, but the
pace nearly doubled to 250 cases in the
final six months.

Other rabies cases reported in mid-
state counties so far this year include:
Somerset, 16; Franklin, 14; Mifflin, 11;
Blair, 10; Huntingdon, eight; Allegheny,
six; Juniata, Lycoming. Montour and
Lehigh, four each; Columbia, Cambria,
Chester and Bucks, three each; Union.
Lebanon, Bedford, Schuylkill and Jeffer-
son, two each; and Lancaster, Snyder,
Fulton, Clearfield, Armstrong and Greene,
one‘each.

 




 

 

LEE ‘WALBURN

How ’Bout That Dog

dog, Catfish, rides in the front seat of

my automobile while my wife rides
in the back. There are some perfectly
good reasons '

I Catfish throws up when he rides in
the backseat and my wife does not.

2. He likes to ride with his head on
my leg and she does not.

3. He does not tell me I am shifting
gears at the wrong speeds. She does.

Others insist that Catfish is spoiled be—
cause I acquiesce to his appetite for white
seedless grapes and cheese, which he will
not eat from a bowl, preferring that I
drop them into his mouth one bite at a
time. To those critics I point out that he is
a Yummie (Young Upwardly Mobile
Mutt), and his values are not those of a
previous generation.

I must admit that Catfish was not
planned. He came along at a time when
my wife had decided we were too old for
puppies, and, as the saying goes, that is
when it always happens.

We had known Catfish and his broth-
er, Mullet, almost from the time they
were born. A neighbor near our cabin,
Hodge Podge Lodge, had acquired them
as companions for his young baby, but the
puppies grew faster than the child, and
when they began to consider the little boy
a toy to be dragged around the pasture,
the owner prepared to dispose of the dogs
in the old-fashioned way of a long trip
down a deserted road.

We arrived at Hodge Podge just in
time to preempt such an unseemly fate
and agreed to find homes for both Catfish
and Mullet. My daughter found a foster
owner for Mullet in Alabama and we
brought Catfish back to Atlanta. My wife
nagged me constantly about the necessity
of quickly locating a suitable home since
she wasn't putting up with any puppy.

After a modest sales campaign by me,
John Smith in the sports department said
when he returned from a two-week as-
signment in Florida, he would take Cat-
fish. I called my wife to break the good
news. There was silence on the other end
of the line. Then I could hear her lips
quivering.

“He's sick," she said.

I rushed home. Catfish was burning
with fever. My wife had tied an ice pack
around his head and a thermometer pro-
truded from his mouth. I knew right then
he was something special, because, as you

S ome people may think it odd that my

 

 

know, ordinary dogs don’t let you take
their temperatures from that end.
There ensued a week of frantic trips to

the vet, who couldnt diagnose the illness

but stuffed Catfish with pills and gave him
a variety of shots which that brave little pup
accepted with appreciation and a lot less
fuss than most people would have

“He 5 something special,” I said

At the end of two weeks I was planning
elaborate lies to tell to John Smith about
whx I would have to renege on our deal

"I'll tell John that Catfish is pit bull," I
said to my wife. “That’s pretty close to part
bull, which he is."

"You better think of something,” she
snarled. " You should have never given him
away."

The dreaded day finally arrived when
John returned from his trip. He walked into
my office and we spoke simultaneously:

"Lee,” he said.

“John,” I said.

“I can’t. . he said.

“I can’t. . . I said.

In this convoluted conversation, I was
apologizing for not being able to part with
Catfish while John was explaining that he
wouldn’t be able to take him.

“He's something special,” I said.

“Yeah, that’s why I couldn't take him
away from you," John said with a touch of
class — and a sigh of relief.

As they say in the movies, time passed
and Catfish approached adulthood with all
the instincts and capriciousness that puber-
ty entails. He ran away from Hodge Podge
one day in pursuit of lustful ambition, and it
took us three days to find him.

Then he left again and we had to re—
tum to Atlanta without him. But the next
day, in a fit of despair, my spouse headed
back for Hodge Podge and spent the better
part of an afternoon searching country
roads for the dog. She returned to the cabin
and was tearing at her clothes and pouring
on ashes and screaming something biblical
when Catfish staggered up the drive and
lay his exhausted head in her hands.

“He's something special," I said later
when she related the story. And he is. What
other dog could move an entire carport of
junk into the front yard by himself? It was
his way, I said, of pointing out that we were
behind in our cleaning. And just the other
day I came home to discover that he had the
complete skeleton of a cow jacked up on
cinder blocks under the big oak tree.

"He’s something special," I said. I

HER PET PROJECT IS A HOWLING
SUCCESS, MAKING CHERE HICKOCK
QUEEN OF THE QUADRUPEDDLERS

My life has become just like one of
David Letterman’s Stupid Pet Tricks
segments,” admits Chere Hickock
sheepishly. “People come up with the
most bizarre things to do with their
animals.” Not that the 29-year-old
beast-booking brunette is growling at
success. Far from it. Her animal talent
agency in Dallas, Animal Trackers,
Inc., has made her the Sue Mengers
and Eileen Ford of the animal king-
dom. Chere (pronounced Sher—ee)
rides herd on a massive menagerie
that includes uniquely trained house
pets, barely tractable big cats and el-
ephants, as well as numerous exotic
birds and reptiles. She fields requests
and culls her client files for the proper
anknw.

for an animal species not listed among
her arkload of available talent, she ‘
just starts phoning the many other ani- 5
mal handlers she knows around the
country. “Animal people are like circus;
people, ” says Hickock. “We know each
other. If I can 'tfind an animal, I usually
know someone who can."

No problem for a woman‘who has
been collecting critters since she was
a kid. Growing up in Dallas, one of six
children of a salesman and a house-
wife, Chere was constantly being
frisked by her mother at the door. “I
was always the sort of little girl who
came home with snakes in her pock-
et," Hickock says with a laugh. Since
wild pets were frowned upon in her
house, Chere had to settle for a dog.

Once out of high school, Hickock
studied agriculture for a year at West
Texas State University. There she
learned, among other things, how to
castrate a pig. “A lot of guys get pretty
nervous when I tell them that," Chere
squeals. While in college, she worked

According to Hickock, she has had
some 70 jobs since she was 15, includ-
ing taxidermist, truck driver, dog
groomer and one six-month stint utiliz-
ing her pig-trimming skills. Along the
way she spent a year in California at
the Moorpark School for Exotic Animal
Training and Management where the
idea for Animal Trackers was hatched.
Hickock noticed that the film industry
was beginning to do a lot of location
work in Texas and that there were few
if any Texans catering to the movies’
animal needs.

Hickock unleashed the company in
April 1984 with seed money from a vet-
erinarian whose name she picked out
of the phone book at random. Chere
did $56, 000 worth of business her first
year and expects to double that this
year. Typical fees run from $75 per
hour to put a dog in front of your Polar-
oid camera to upwards of $150 an hour
for a tiger on your lawn. As agent and
often handler, Hickock takes roughly
20 percent of everything that comes in.
It is well-earned compensation for the
risks involved. Hickock, who recently . Pampered Poodle Martini mugs like the

Pet owners can sometimes be as
pushy as stage mothers in thinking
their cat is the next Morris or their dog
is the best thing since Lassie. At a re-
cent open casting call in a local park-
ing lot, Chere put some two dozen do—
mestic felines and canines through
their varied paces. She also took a
look at a beer-drinking lion, a white
Alaskan wolf and a raven. For most of
the devoted pet owner-promoters it
was “Don’t call me, I’ll call you,” and
then Hickock was off to a lunch meet-
ing in her gold Chevy Suburban with
the cage in the back.

Though Hickock is single, she
doesn’t exactly live alone. She shares
her three-bedroom house not far from
her office in North Dallas with a red-
tailed boa named Jason, a goat named
Gertie, a crow named Trammel, a mon—
key named Mona, a rabbit named Lago,
a parrot named Lolly and three un-

_ FORUM

Trapper claims

get response

EDITOR:

A LETTER from Michael J.
Devitz that appeared in the Oct.
31 Evening News contained
such a plaintive plea for getting
' “the facts straight” and showed
his keen desire not to “fool peo-
ple with unproven lies” that I
feel compelled to assist him in
his search for the truth. (Some
might say I’m calling his bluff).

In his letter, which defended
trapping, Mr. Devitz stated that
he “could gladly put my fingers
into a trap .to show how a trap
numbs the foot and is virtually
painless.” I will most gladly as-
sist this demonstration by
springing a trap on Mr. Devitz’s
fingers, or any other part of his
body he wants numbed. The trap
I will use is one that I confiscat-
ed after it had caught and
maimed a wild mallard duck.

(The duck lost his entire foot and
the jerk responsible for the trap
was never apprehended).

In order to ensure that we do
get all the facts straight, Mr.
Devitz will be permitted to en-
joy his virtually painless experi-
ence in a controlled setting, with

.every effort afforded to match

the conditions in which other
animals are trapped. Of course,
as a sporting'person, I will check
on Mr. Devitz in 24 hours, barr-
ing any inclement weather that
might make me loathe to leave
my hearthside.

When finally released from
the trap, Mr. Devitz can tell us
what the real facts are on the
degree of pain suffered by a
trapped animal. He should also
be able to enlighten us as to any
terror, hunger or thirst experi-
enced while trapped.

So I call on Mr. Devitz to
contact me so that we may set
up this fact-finding demonstra-
tion. He seems to have a sincere
interest — which I do share —
in helping our farmers, so per-
haps we could sell tickets and
use the proceeds for such a wor-
thy cause.

'Moimed by traps

EDITOR:

MICHAEL J. DEVITZ de-
fends his trapping, says traps
are “painless” and calls anti-
trappers “liars trying to fool the
public.” Well, the legless dogs
and cats I’ve seen don’t seem to
agree with Mr. Devitz — (but I
don’t wish to call him a liar).

Mr. Devitz assures us he’d be
happy to stick his fingers into a
trap. Fine — let him best simu-
late how the slender paw of a
fox gets mangled in a steel-'jawl

. trap.

Directions: Set-up one #2
leghold trap. Lower one index
finger onto trigger. Bingo!

It’s doubtful Mr. Devitz
would follow this prescription
to specification — (but I don’t
wish to call him a liar).

Mr. Devitz says wild animals
are difficult to lure into traps.
Any trapper worth his coonskin
uses sex scent as lure. The dumb
animals, being the hedonists
they are, have no choice but to
paw at the traps — (but I don’t
wish to call him a liar).

Mr. Devitz says Pennsylva-
nia law requires trappers to
check their traps daily. Pennsyl-
vania game code requires traps
be checked every 36 hours. Of

course it’s unenforceable — (but
I don’t wish to call Mr. Devitz a
liar). ‘

Aside from the pure repug-
nance which trapping engenders
in normal people, it is of aca-
demic interest to realize there
exist among us a few minds lit-
tle evolved from the Neandertal.
They actually see nothing
wrong with sadism. Could it be
that trapping serves as a
catharsis for these hominids
who may otherwise prey upon
society? Well, it’s doubtful. I
rather think them cruel and cal-
lous, common cowards. Liars?
Well, you decide.

Food, not for

EDITOR:

I WOULD like to respond to
the gentleman who wrote of the
humanity of trapping wild ani-
mals. He asks if anti-trappers
ever eat pork, beef or chicken.
Unfortunately, most of us do in
order for ourselves and our fam-
ilies to live healthy lives.

Now, I would like to ask
how many trappers eat fox,
skunk, birds, raccoon, dogs and
cats? How many of these ani-
mals are merely thrown away

because they aren’t worth any
money? How many of these ani-
mals are slaughtered for their
fur or for their urine in order to
provide a scent for the next vic-
tim?

How are these animals fin-
ished off once they are discov-
ered in these traps? Are their
throats stepped on until they
suffocate in order not to “dam-
age” their fur with a bullet hole?
Or maybe you’re skilled enough
with agun that you can walk
right up to their head, put the
barrel of a gun between their
terrified eyes and pull the trig-
ger.

Yes, the trap must be'
checked every day. There are 24
long hours in one day. Would
you “gladly” step into one of
your traps in the dark~of the
woods and wait 24 hours to be
released? Maybe you would.
But, I’m sure you wouldn’t wait
in your virtually painless trap
with hungry, wild animals all
around you for 24 hours only to
have your head blown off the
next morning.

NEW YORK TIMES

— Nov. 11, 1985

After a IOO-Year Hiatus, Bison-Hunting Season Is Set to Begin

 

By JIM ROBBINS

Special to The New York Times

HELENA, Mont., Nov. 10 -— For the
first time in nearly 100 years, hunters
will have an open season to kill wild
bison, the shaggy, lumbering animals
that roamed the Plains in the millions
before they were driven to the brink of
extinction in the late 1800’s.

Beginning Dec. 1, hunters whose
names have been picked in a lottery
will be able to kill bison that stray into
Montana from their refuge in Yellow-
stone National Park. As many as 100
bison could be killed before the season
ends June 30, officials said.

Shooting the animals is necessary,
wildlife officials said, because the herd
is infected with brucellosis, a disease
that causes bovines to abort their
young. If the bison are not killed, the
disease could spread to local livestock.

Avoiding Meddling With Nature

Federal officials at Yellowstone said
they felt it was better to kill 100 bison on
the park’s northern boundary than to
try to eradicate the disease and thus
. run the risk of damaging the entire Yel-
lowstone herd, now.2,000 strong. They

say the disease may be an important‘

The New York Times/NOV. 11, 1985

Bison that wander over park bor-
tier face a hunt in Montana.

 

natural regulator of the herd’s size, and
the National Park Service’s policy is
generally to avoid interfering with the
park’s natural features.

The public hunt was approved by the
State Legislature, drawing criticism
from the State Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks, which preferred
that the killing be done by wildlife pro-
fessionals rather than by hunters.
Some local residents also object.

“I can’t see whyanyone would want
to shoot a bison,” said Leonard Sar-
gent, a rancher in Gardiner, just north
of the park. “Any resemblance to sport
is purely coincidental. It should be done
professionally.”

Bison behave much like cattle and
have almost no fear of humans. But Ed
Francis, who runs a ranch where most
of the errant bison end up, said cattle
“are more defensive than buffalo.” He
said the hunted bison “just stand there
and die -— it’s not a sport.”

The state wildlife agency contends
that its job of running the public hunt
will be a logistical nightmare and says
it will be difficult to assure proper dis-

,posal of brucellosis-contaminated ani-

mal tissue. ,

But the Montana Wildlife Federa-
tion, a sporting group that lobbied the
Legislature for the public hunt, con-
tends that it is better than having the
state slaughter the animals, as was
done last year when the state agency,
at the request of the state veterinarian,
killed 88 roaming bison. “We support
the hunt,” said Jim Richard, the feder-
ation’s executive director. “The hunt-
ing opportunity outweighs the question
of whether it’s a sporting hunt.”

Mr. Richard said that most hunters
in Montana'consider the bison a good
source of food. “I assume they’ll be
meat-hunting and do something classy
with the hide -— get it tanned,” he said.

State wildlife officials say that
brucellosis can be passed on to humans
if the meat is not cooked well enough.
The agency has issued guidelines fOr
disposing of bison intestines, which are
particular sources of brucellosis con-
tamination.

In the 1880’s only several hundred
wild bison existed, sheltered in the
thickly forested valleys o} the newly

Bison that wandered from Yellowstone National Park resting near a picnic area in "Gardiner, Mont.

 

 

created Yellowstone Park. But there
were no laws to protect them, and
poachers soon whittled the number to
25. In 1902, the Park Service began
ranching bison to increase their num-
bers. The service bred bison until the
1950’s, when there were several thou-
sand.

Wandering for Forage

The bison now wander off the Yellow-
stone plateau in the late fall and early
winter, when heavy snows cover much
of the plateau’s grassland, to forage in
lower elevations along the Yellowstone
River. But cattle ranches take up most
of the Paradise Valley area favored by
the wanderers, and ranchers fear the
bison will infect their animals and lead
to financial ruin. ,

State wildlife officials contend that
the problem of wandering bison should
not fall solely into their lap. “The rea‘
son we’ve got this problem is that the
Park Service has not been accepting
responsibility for the animals,” said
Jim Flynn, director of the state wildlife
agency. “I’m concerned that they may
view the hunt as a solution to their
problems.”

A park research biologist Mary

 

Meagher, said, however, that park
managers did not have the authority to
shoot bison in the park but are consid-
ering asking the Interior Secretary for
permission to do so. Park managers
are preparing an environmental as-
sessment of their options.

'Miss Meagher said the problem of
wandering bison began in the mid-
1970’s when herd leaders discovered
the rich winter habitat along the river
outside the park.

Now, she said, the most feasible way
to keep the bison in the park may be to
shoot the animals that know about the
rich grasses outside. “What we need is
to remove the knowledge by removing
the animals,” Miss Meagher said.
Trying to eradicate brucellosis by
medical treatment, she“ said, is not
desirable because the disease may be
an important natural regulator of bison
numbers.

Herding Was ‘Often Fruitless’

State wildlife officials said herding
the animals back into the park was ex-
pensive, time-consuming and often
fruitless. “We drive them back into the
park with helicoptérs and trucks in the
afternoon, and they’re back out by

 

evening,” said Jerry Wells, assistant
director of the state wildlife agency’s
Bozeman office.

People who want to hunt bison must
apply to the agency by Nov. 15. A hun-
dred hunters’ names selected by lot-
tery will be put on a list. The state wild-
life agency has already received 1,600
applications, more than they had ex-
pected.

When an animal wanders over the
northern park boundary near 'this
small tourist town, the first person on
the list will be called. A hunter, guided
by a state game warden, will have 36
hours to shoot the bison. Licenses for
the hunt are $200 for Montana residents
and $1,000 for nonresidents.

Although there have been hunts of
domesticated bison in the West, this is
the first hunt of wild, free-roaming
bison, except for three animals killed
by sportsmen north of the park under a
special permit in 1953. There has been
no open season on bison since the Fed-
eral Government passed a wildlife pro-
tection law in 1894. ‘

Because of their majesty, bison have
been the symbol of the Interior Depart-
ment since it was formed in the late
1800’s.

Beaver war in the UP?
Battle lines are drawn

tate Sen. Joseph Mack wants

to declare war on beavers --

which Mack calls

“amphibious rats” —
because, he says, they’re chewing
down trees in the Upper Peninsula
faster than loggers can cut them
down.

“It is no secret that beavers are
causing tremendous damage to the
natural resources of our state,”
Mack, D-Ironwood, said in a
statement Tuesday. “They have
invaded cemeteries and destroyed
hundreds of .1 ’
thousands of
dollars worth of
timber.”

Beaver dams
also are flooding
forests and
destroying trout
streams in
Mack’s district,
he said. Ronald
Skoog. director Sen. Mack
of the state
Department of Natural Resources,
and the state’s Natural Resources
Commission are ignoring the
problem, Mack said. The DNR denies
the charge.

Department officials say they
have begun controlling the animals
by extending trapping seasons — by
six weeks in 1983 — and removing
limits on how many animals trappers
can take in the western UP.

A bill sponsored by Mack that was
recently reported out of a Senate
committee would let the director of a
UP regional DNR office declare a
beaver emergency and remove most

3”“? rig-4 2*

 

restrictions on killing them.

Mack lauded a Wisconsin
program that awarded $25 to anyone
producing a dead beaver, but he
hasn’t proposed a beaver bounty in
Michigan.

State biologists agree with Mack
that the beaver population is growing
because trappers are killing fewer of
the animals. But Bob Strong, wildlife
biologist for the DNR in the UP, said
the measures the department has
taken are sufficient.

“We’ve got a beaver problem, but
not to the extent that Sen. Mack
thinks we do,” Strong said. “You just
can’t declare all.out war on beavers
because the problems aren’t that bad
that we can’t solve them.”

In the western UP, where the
animals are a major nuisance, DNR
permits allow beavers to be shot or
trapped outside the regular season,
which started Oct. 25.

Trappers are losing interest in
beavers because the price for prime
pelts has dropped from $80 more
than a decade ago to about $25 this
year, Strong said. Fewer people are
buying garments made from animal
furs, Strong said. "

It is unsafe — and illegal — to
shoot beavers, according to Strong.
The animals are usually found in
ponds and streams, where a rifle
bullet that misses the target can skip
in any direction, he said.

A better solution, Strong said, is to
improve the market for trappers by
promoting Michigan beaver hats or
the sale of beaver meat.

“They’re good eating. You can
bake ’em just like you would a

raccoon,” Strong said.

Captive Whales

I wish that peeple were as
concerned about captive whales
as they were about the errant
humpback.

Orcas (killer whales) have a
life expectancy of some 50 years
in the wild. In captivity, the life
of this social, far-ranging mam-
mal is reduced to a pitiful four
years, with not a single success-
ful birth having been recorded.
Captivity is a death sentence.

Recently the Boston “Whales
Alive!” conference recommend-
ed that all captive cetaceans be
phased out. What better time
than now, before those expen-
sive facilities are built, for Val-
lejo’s new Marine World to fol-

are they more interested in the

Dear Mr. Lovitz:

It seems incongruous to me that an industry which is making a
considerable living from the care of pet birds, would resort

to building a "fur center" in New Jersey, an industry making

its money from.the fur of dead animals.

There is nothing beautiful or attractive in a fur coat unless

it is on the back of the animal it belongs to. The advertising
world is responsible for making women think they look attaactive
in the skins of dead animals, but they don't — not really.

Most of these unfortunate animals die a horrible death in a
steel-jawed trap; the furs from.these animals are the ones con—
sidered the most beautiful, not those grown on fur farms.

When the general pet—owning public becomes aware of your in-
tentions, Mr. Lovitz, I firmly believe Hartz Mbuntain.Industries
Mdll feel the response in their pocketbooks - where it will hurt
the most. I know the friends I have who are opposed to the
murder of wild.animalsfor their fUrs ‘would certainly not sup-
port Hartz Mbuntain if you continue with this planned construction.
Your industry stands fer life - the fhr industry stands for death.

bleed to death.

The rustlers were poachers, and they sold the antlers on the black mar-
ket. The antlers were ground into a ﬁne powder or cut into waferlike pieces
and sold for $120 an ounce; in some Oriental cultures processed antlers are
regarded as an aphrodisiac.

Poaching in the national parks has grown into a multimillion-dollar clandestine
business run by criminals who prey on natural resources. Each year, everything
from bighorn sheep and grizzly bears to poisonous reptiles and rare cactuses
become the victims of poachers. Park ofﬁcials fear the survival of future gen-
erations of some species is threatened Says Tom Hobbs, chief of rangers at
Yellowstone National Park: 3

“It’s pretty brutal stuff. You’re deal-
ing with a ﬁnite resource, and it will
disappear. The parks were set aside
so these animals and plants would be
protected. Now they’re being taken
away, and you can’t replace them.
That’s about as serious as you can get.”

The commercialization of wildlife is
flourishing because it is impossible for
park rangers to patrol adequately the
millions of acres of wilderness where
much of it occurs. In some regions,
poaching is a rite of passage from boy—
hood to manhood —— a tradition that
began generations before the national-
park system was established in 1916.

36 ° American Way, November 12, 1985

In other regions, tough economic times
and high unemployment make the na-
tional parks easy targets for those
trying to make a fast buck. Says Ro-
land Wauer, an assistant superintend—
ent of the Great Smoky Mountains
National Park in Tennessee and North
Carolina:

“We have poaching every day of the
year in this park. We try to protect the
resources, but there aren’t even
enough of us to protect it during the
day, much less enough to work against
the clever individual who has an
arrogance for the law” and works
at night.

Park ofﬁcials don’t know exactly how
much poaching occurs each year or
how seriously natural resources are
being depleted. Hobbs says:

“Poaching is one of those silent
crimes that is very difﬁcult to put a
speciﬁc number on. But take an area
the size of Yellowstone. How much do
we not know about? I suspect it's a
lot more.”

Interviews with national park su-
penntendents, rangers. wildlife spe-
CIalists, and federal agents paint a pic—
ture of a highly prosperous trade in
ﬂora and fauna that is jeopardizing the
survival of some unusual natural re-

 




sources. Some poaching operations are
highly sophisticated, using helicop-
ters, dart guns, and high-powered ri-
ﬂes to zoom in on unsuspecting ani-
mals in snow-covered areas of the
western parks. Others take their catch
out on pack trains of burros over the
arid desert of the Southwest.

At Big Bend National Park in south-
west Texas, several remote areas of
the 1,100-square-mile park have been
stripped of small rainbow cactus by
rustlers who dig them up with pitch-
forks and stuff them into burlap bags.
Some are carried across the Rio
Grande River to Mexico and sold to

cactus dealers. Others are loaded in
burlap bags onto the backs of burros
or mules and taken out of the park at
night across the Chihuahuan Desert by
way of trading routes that have been
around for hundreds of years. The
cactuses turn up in American nurser—
ies where they may sell for $20 each,
according to Big Bend-superintendent
Gil Lusk. Over the past few years,
more than 100,000 plants have disap-
peared from the park. Says Lusk:
“This is pretty rough terrain. There
are a lot of canyons around the Chisos
Mountains where people can move

in and out . . . and not be seen. Evg

Poachers prize the bobcat for its pelt,

and the Rocky Mountain bull elk for its

antlers, which when ‘in velvet’ command

a high price in Asia.

numbers and to set hunting quotas.

But a vast number of creatures,
along with enthusiastic nonhunters
who love wildlife, are ignored by
this system. More than 600 species
of wildlife (birds, mammals, ﬁsh,
reptiles, amphibians, crustaceans,

and mollusks) are considered non—‘

game animals. The category cov—
ers everything from cardinals and
garter snakes to bald eagles, bob-
cats, box turtles, and blue—lined

any, of a state’s fish and wildlife
budget went towards preserving or
managing these animals.

A relatively new revenue-raising

Ginseng, a plant songht for its sup],

has disappeared from some wilder-
ness areas in the Shenandoah and
Great Smoky Mountains national
parks. .In the Smokies, almost all of
.- the ginseng, which sells for up to $200
~ 3 pound, has been'harvested. Poach-
-. ers gather the ginseng in spring to dry
; l and then ship abroad.
’ ‘ In the old western parks such as
" l Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and Gla-
; cier, big-game hunters search out rare
animals to sell to trophy collectors,
. " who pay as much as $20,000 for the
‘ head of a big-horn sheep. One poacher
i of bighorn sheep was arrested by fed-
i eral agents after a naturalist accidently
ﬁlmed the episode fromlafar. A grizzly
bear, a threatened species, can bring
up to $20,000 on the black market
‘ when the claws, head, cape, and gall
bladder (a valued Asian aphrodisiac),
are sold separately.
During the summer of 1984, 12 elk
, were killed at the 2.25-million-acre
Yellowstone National Park. ‘Their an-
i tlers, which were “in velvet,” were

ducted several successful “sting” op-
erations against poachers, estimated that
' in one year, poachers illegally collected
28 tons of antlers in Yellowstone and
‘ grossed $30 million. Elk antlers have
been prescribed for such conditions as
_ impotence, poor appetite, anerrua,
heart failure, and loss of memory.
I Like Big Bend National Park, both
Saguaro and Organ Pipe Cactus na-
, tional monuments are being denuded
. of rare cactus. The acuna cactus has
almost disappeared during the past
l few years, and Harold Smith, an of—
: ﬁcial at Organ Pipe, says he believes
'; “man is no doubt a large part of the
. reason for the demise.” The giant s;

 

 

guaro, that familiar symbol of the
Southwest, sells in American nurser-
ies for several hundred dollars each.
Park ofﬁcials say the saguaro grows
so slowly that the giant plants found in
U. S. nurseries can come only from the
park or nearby areas. ‘

‘Reptile poaching also plagues the
southwestern parks. At the 330,000-
acre Organ Pipe on the Sonoran De-
sert in Arizona, park rangers arrested
a man carrying 14 rare snakes and liz-
ards in a cloth bag. He apparently had
poached them in the middle of the night
with a device that squeezes them into
a container. Private collectors will fork
over more than $1,000 each for many
of the 26 species of snakes native to
the area.

The Everglades National Park in
Florida has waged a fairly successful
war against poaching alligators, which
are sold illegally for hides that will be
made into boots, belts, handbags, and.
shoes. In the early 19705, several

 

 

southern states banded together to
outlaw alligator poaching by making it
illegal for anyone to take or possess
an alligator. That action has curbed
some poaching but has not stopped it.
Park ofﬁcials say they can’t remem-
ber a visitor being hurt by poachers,
but a park ranger was killed nearly a
decade ago when he happened onto a
group of men illegally taking deer in
California. “Poachers are not inter-
ested in people unless they walk into
an illegal operation,” Hobbs says.
Even though poaching is threaten-
ing some natural resources, only about
2 percent of any park’s budget is spent

 

l

. to control the problem, a ﬁgure most

park superintendents say is far too low.
As rangers walk or ride their usual
beats, they keep their eyes open for

. illegal activities. Occasionally park ad-

ministrators will set up special patrols

i if they suspect poaching or have been

given a tip by informants. The head-

l quarters of the National Park Service

in Washington, D.C., has not made
tpoaching' one of its top priorities. In
fact, it keeps no records on how much

 

poaching occurs each year.

But the trade in illegally taken ani-
mals has caught the eye of the Justice
IiDepartment Less than four years ago,

g? it created a special branch to deal with

United States and abroad. In October,
1984, more than 20 people were ar-
h’ested in predawn raids for illegally

poaching numerous protected or en-
dangered species, primarily in the Yel-
lowstone National Park area. Says
Donald Carr, section chief of the wild-
life and marine resources division of
the Justice Department:

“The government has stepped up
its efforts to apprehend and prosecute
poachers. This is by no means the ﬁrst
and by no means the last [prosecution]
of major wildlife trafﬁckers.”

In the past- year more than 200 peo-
ple have been arrested on charges of
wildlife violations. On March 19 a res-
ident of Big Timber, Montana, was
sentenced to 15 years in jail for slaugh-
tering various species of wildlife in the
wilderness surrounding Yellowstone
National Park.

Federal agents also are monitoring
the 10 major American ports of entry
“to tighten the noose around the illegal
trafﬁc in and out of the U. S. [of poached
animals],” says Allen E. Smith, pres—
ident of Defenders of Wildlife and
formerly with the division of wildlife

. and marine resources of the Justice

Department. He explains:

“Most poaching is driven by inter-
national trade. The problem is second
only to the illegal trafﬁc in hard
drugs. . . . The federal government
has set up an exhaustive network . . .
to work on the illegal trade and traf-
ﬁc, . . . the stimulus for big-game
poaching.”

The federal Lacey Act, passed in
1900 to curb market hunting and to
help states protect wildlife, makes it
illegal to transport in interstate or for-
eign commerce wildlife taken in vio-
lation of state laws. The act was
amended in 1981 to include plants. Vi-
olators face felony charges and can be
punished with $20,000 ﬁnes and ﬁve-
year jail sentences. A patchwork of
state laws applies to poachers who do
not cross state lines.

But too frequently, park ofﬁcials say,
poachers either go free or are ﬁned
less than $1,500 for their crime. Says
Wauer, of the Great Smokies:

“You can poach a lot of grizzly bears
or elk and get caught once and still be
way ahead of the game ﬁnancially.
There’s not much incentive to stop”.

to save human lives — Richard Ryder, British psychologist

The monkeys lay strapped to operating tables with their
heads encased in metal helmets. With the ﬂip of a switch,
their necks were wrenched violently to simulate a car
wreck. Then, hammers and screwdrivers were used to pry
their heads free of the contraptions.

This didn’t happen in the basement lab of some mad sci-
entist. It was an experiment at the University of Pennsylva-
nia’s Head Research Center until it was halted last July.

Animal research is not a pretty sight. r

At Michigan State University, researchers damaged the
throats of 12 ponies, fed half a soft diet, the other half rough
hay, and then killed them all.

Why? To prove scientiﬁcally what common sense should
have told them: Throat injuries heal better on a soft diet.

At the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte,
Calif. the throats of dogs were painted with a caustic, can-
cer-causing agent to study the early stages of cancer. Yet
the center failed to provide proper veterinary Care to ease
the animals’ pain. .

Every year across the USA, 20 million animals, most of
them rodents, are drugged, infected with disease, and go
under the researcher’s knife. There is evidence that too
many of these animals suffer needlessly.

Some lab workers are not properly trained, some ani-
mals are not properly cared for, and some animals give up
their lives for projects that make little or no sense — like
testing the safety of eye liners and toilet bowl cleaners.

At last, some of these abuses are being addressed:

Last May, the General Accounting Ofﬁce reported that
federal animal welfare ofﬁcers who are supposed to in-
spect research sites were inadequately trained and had no
formal system for inspection visits.

. Congress is considering legislation to tighten existing
rules on animal research. It must pass.

~ And in Washington this week, the presidents of the USA’s
public universities devoted part of their meeting to a seesion
on government guidelines for animal research.

But these actions are not enough for ardent animal rights
advocates who say that no animal should be a guinea pig for
human health and safety. They want an end to all animal
experiments.

Stop all these tests
and save animal lives

TUCSON, Ariz. — The ani-
mal rights movement is con-
stantly asked how it can justify
wanting to abolish vivisection
— cutting up of live animals --e
when so many medical break-
throughs haVe resulted from
this use of animals.

It’s simple.

Not only have the so-called
breakthroughs been riddled
with false hopes and some-
times outright fraud, but the is-
sues of pain, torture, and men-
tal and physical agony remain
completely unaddressed.

The mass public has been
carefully programmed to be-
lieve that every word emitted
from a research facility is as
good as gold. It’s a myth that
must be put to sleep. '

When the media publish ac-
counts of medical miracles,
they don’t give details of the
misery of millions of animals
used, or, more importantly,
how they are used. '

When these miracles turn
out to be groundless, the public
rarely learns of the devastating
damage done to human health
and well-being, so the myth
continues. '

The scandal involving the
University of Pennsylvania
brain-smashing experiment on
baboons came to light recently
only because informed activ-
ists refused to be silent.

For 15 years, intense suffer-
ing had been indicted on these
animals. The gigantic flaws in
the system were exposed, and
multiple violations of the few
regulations that exist came to
light.

Few people realized that this
example is not the exception,
it’s the rule, because the polic-

ing agents within laboratories
rely on the buddy system.

No vivisector tattles on an-
other. When careers and pro-
motions are at stake, anything

can be justiﬁed.

Animal care committees are
monopolized by persons with a
vested interest in self-aggran-
dizement and keeping the sta-
tus quo.

People will believe a big lie
faster than they will a small
one. And if told often enough, it
becomes the accepted truth.

In the 18505, the shame of
slavery was legal and accept-
able. Defenseless men were
beaten, starved, and driven in-
sane without fear of punish-
ment for the offender. ,

Today, researchers are al-
lowed to do these thin§ and
much worse to animals. We’re
promised cures of everything
from death to hangnails, so ex-
perimenters'burn, poison, radi-
ate, batter, and maim at will.
It’s all legal.

Deep in our human con-
sciences, we know this to be un-
just, and we must abolish it as
we did slavery. _

Real breakthroughs will
come to human medical prdb-
lems when we stop using a spe-
cies that is so unlike ourselves
that we get misleading and
false information.

If we continue to allow de-

sensitized people to dictate

medical policy, we’ll continue
to be in crisis.

Just imagine what they’ll
soon be able to justify doing to

AIDS points up need
for animal research

WASHINGTON — AIDS is
the most pressing public health
issue of our time. Many non-an-
imal methodologies have been
extremely valuable in provid-
ing the information we have so
far. But the ﬁrst clues to the
cause were found in animals,
and the development of effec-
tive treatments and a vaccine
is going to involve research
with laboratory animals.

The ﬁrst hint that AIDS was
caused by a virus resulted
from research into a type of
leukemia that can afﬂict cats:
the virus causing feline leuke
mia also attacked the immune
system, leaving the animal de-
fenseless against-microbes that
are harmless to healthy cats.

When AIDS surfaced as a
major health threat, research-
ers realized that, if a virus

'could cause such immune deﬁ-
ciency in cats, the same might
be true for humans. That was
the ﬁrst step in the successful
hunt for the AIDS virus.

Right now, clinical research-
.ers are testing a variety of
drug on AIDS patients without
the extensive animal testing
for safety and efficacy normal-
ly required. These patients are
serving as guinea pigs because
they know they are certain to
die otherwise. Their willing-
ness is understandable.

But can physicians ethically
give drugs not tested thorough-
ly for safety and effectiveness
to people with AIDS-related
complex, people who may nev-
er develop AIDS itself? Can
such drugs be given to the mil-
lion or more people who have
been exposed to the virus with-
out tests to determine whether

cal Research.

 

they will do more harm than
good? The only reasonable as-
surance will come from ani-
mal testing

And developing a safe and
effective vaccine will require
an animal that can be infected
with the disease close enough
to the human version to be sci-
entiﬁcally useful. Finding an
animal model will help' answer
many questions about AIDS.

Why doesn’t everyone ex-
posed to the virus develop the
disease? What accounts for the
fact that AIDS-related complex

' does not always progress to 1e-

thal AIDS? At what point in the
natural history of the disease
will drugs that do become
available be most effective? At
what dose levels? At what risk
to the patient?

The years of research that
will precede the discovery of
medical means to cure and
prevent AIDS will demand in-
numerable experiments —
many with laboratory animals.

Research into feline leuke-
mia resulted in a vaccine that
can now protectpet cats
against a killer disease. Hope-
fully, this breakthrough will be
paralleled by medical ad-
vances toward the elimination
of a powerful and mysterious
destroyer of humans.

Perhaps the day will soon ar-
rive when we read of more
AIDS research involving ani-
mals. It will signal real pro-
grels in the battle against the
deadliest infectious disease this
generation has known.

Reverence for life --— and research

LUTHERVILLE, Md. -—
There can be no medical ad-
vancement without animal ex-
perimentation. Yet, as a sur-
geon ,and former researcher, I
also know there has been
much abuse of this license by
many scientists with unneces-
sary and overlapping experi-
ments and a callous disregard
for suffering animals.

The worst maltreatment I’ve
seen was while doing heart-
transplantation at the Lenin In-
stitute in Moscow in 1958.

The most shocking was, the
long row of monkeys, their un-
sedated brains monitored with
electrodes, pinned to boards
for weeks, having had both up-
per and lower limbs amputat-
ed, then transposed to the op-
posite side.

This was to practice severed
limb reattachment. It could
certainly have been done with

animals of a lower order.-

Should we use Our closest an-
cestors, those near us on the
phylogenetic scale, that react

to fear and pain much as we
do? There is little doubt that
there are diﬁerent levels of
emotional trauma and physical
suffering at. the amoeba, the
frog, and the chimpanzee stage
of evolution. Yet scientists
think use of animals closer to
humans is at times mandatory
and at other times desirable
for more valid conclusions.

I am now ﬁnishing a book on
my conversations with Albert
Schweitzer while working in
Lambarene, Gabon. Discus-
sions of his philosophy of “rev-
erence for life” naturally in-
cluded much on animal-experi-
mentation. The following are

some excerpted quotations:

I“If we respect all life,
from the wasp to the great
apes, we may some day think
kindly of our fellow man. To
me, that is Christianity.”

I “Our level of life com-
petes with lower ones unrea-
sonably.”

I “In order to save life, we ..

must frequently destroy it.”

. Dr. Edgar Berman, a physi-
czan and author, is a columnist
for Gannett News Service.

I “Think of life and death
priorities before you experi-
ment on your own animal an-
cestois. We are all part of the
same family.” ,

I “The instinct for survival
of our own species necessitates
animal research.” ,

I “Only man has the faculty
to judge what is least harmful
to laboratory animals in his
own search for survival.”

I “God put animals on earth
with a nervous system -— the
culmination of which is man’s
brain. We must use that brain
to determine how we treat oth-
er animals.” .

ITo a difﬁcult theoretical
question, he replied, “It may be
medically useful to experiment
on a congenitally brainless,
deaf, and blind infant rather
than a happy, alert, loving. ca-
nine, but it’s morally unsound
-— I couldn’t do it.”

I think that if they can’t Con-
duct experiments without mak-
ing the animals suffer, then the
tests should be stopped. If
they’re going to be needlessly
cruel, the tests should not con-

. tinue. I’ve heard horror stories
about animal cruelty, and I’ve
seen some grUesome things on
TV, and it’s very sad. Too many
tests make the animals suffer.

 

RAY NICOSKI, 54

Experimentation shouldn’t
be banned, but it should be con-
ducted in a way that minimizes
the cruelty to animals. Because
of so many new diseases and
because of the need to advance
medical science, there is a
need for testing, but it should
be done with care and discre-
tion. Without experiments, how
can we make discoveries?

experiments using animals? ..

 

 

JO ANN WEST, 40

I’m not prepared to say ani-
mals are suffering in laborato-
ries. These experiments are es-
sential, and I don’t worry too
much about whether or not it’s
, cruel to the animals. Isn’t it bet-
ter that we test animals rather
than humans’? These experi-
ments should continue, be-
cause they’re beneﬁcial and
productive. ,

 

TOM BARNE Y, 19

Westville, Ill.

Let’s face it — animal ex-

; perimentation is necessary. If

animals suffer in the labs be-
fore or after experimentation,
that’s the way it has to be. Cer-
tainly human life is more im-
portant. As long as these ex-
periments are in some way
helping humans, I’m in favor of
them. They’re necessary, even
though they cause pain.

SCOTT PLEAU, 23 '
Sales clerk -
Menominee, Mich.

Frankly, animal experimen-
tation is not something that I
worry about and think about
every day. Most of these tests
and experiments are neces-
sary, even though they might
sometimes be cruel and harm-
ful to the animals. It’s just
something that has to be done.
I’d rather have these experi-

. ments than not have them.

 

 

GLENDA BOUFFARD, 51
Counselor
Gulf Breeze, Fla.

I have mixed feelings. I’m

against animals having to live

in poor conditions in the labs,
but I feel that experimentation
should continue because hu-
man life is the most important.
I see no point in burning a rab-
bit’s eyes, for instance, to test
cosmetics. I’m against needless
cruelty but in favor of more
relevant experimentation.

I love animals. They’re
GOd’s creatures, and it bothers
me to see them undergo undue
stress and pain. However, since
human life is also important,
testing is necessary. If testing
means saving a life or making
life better, I’m in favor of it if
it’s done carefully. I don’t like
to see animals have to live in

poor conditions, either.

Chimp supply
for research   *
in jeopardy

By ERIK ECKHOLM
New York Times

NEW YORK -- With the nation’s future supply of re-
search chimpanzees in jeopardy, federal authorities
hope to establish a special population of 350 pampered
animals that would be exempted from medical duties
and enjoy emotionally rich upbringings designed to en-
hance their reproductive skills.

Chimpanzees, the closest relative to humans in the
animal world, are considered indispensable for certain
medical experiments, including future tests of possible
vaccines against AIDS. The projected decline in Amer-
ican research animals has engendered wide concern.

Since the mid-1970s, no imports have been permitted
of chimpanzees caught in the wilds of Africa, where the
species is threatened. Hundreds of the animals, have
been bred in captivity. But without'new measures, scien-
tists say, the future availability of chimpanzees will be
endangered by two trends.

First, as the chimpanzees born here in captivity
reach maturity, most are proving inept at mating and
child rearing. Specialists believe this is because the ani-
mals were psychologically wounded in infancy by social
deprivation, especially early removal from their moth-

ers. Nearly half the 1,200 chimpanzees held for science.

are now captive-born and that proportion is steadily
climbing. '

Second, many of the animals are used in experi-
ments with a mysterious form of viral hepatitis, non A
non B, that can leave them and their offspring perma-
nently infectious. Since no test exists to determine which
of the exposed animals continue to carry the virus, these
“compromised” animals cannot be used for many other
kinds of medical research.

“With current practices, production of experimen-
tally uncompromised offspring, behaviorally capable of
rearing their offspring, will fall to zero within approxi-
mately 20 years,” a Federal panel has warned.

In January the National Institutes of Health will pro-
pose to Congress a $17 million, four-year National Chim-
panzee Management Plan. Under the plan, the federal
government would help five to eight different institutes
establiSh breeding populations totaling 350 animals,
from which about 30 to 35 young chimpanzees could be
culled for research uses each year. Medical researchers
currently require about 60 new chimpanzees annually

and especially value younger animals, not yet large and.

dangerous to handle.

“This is a minimal program,” said Dennis Johnsen,
an expert on primate research at the National Institutes
of Health. “It won’t meet all the needs, but it will insure
that a breeding population is saved for the future. If we
don’t do something, chimpanzees will disappear from
the scene in the United States.” .

The new proposals come at a time of increased soul-
searching about obligations to an animal that is highly
intelligent and often startlingly humanlike. The lifetime
cost of keeping a chimpanzee can reach a quarter of a
million dollars. The suggestion made by some officials to

Chimpanzees are considered indispensable for
certain medical experiments, researchers say.

destroy chimpanzees that, because of hepatitis infection
or other causes, “cannot earn their keep” has provoked
an outcry from many researchers as well as.from ani-
mal welfare activists. .
Because chimpanzees have become so expensive
and scarce, researchers now use them sparingly, in CI‘ltl'
cal experiments when no other species Will do and that
seldom cause physical damage or death. The majority .of
chimpanzees are involved in research on hepatitis, in-
cluding hepatitis-B, which infects some 200 million peo-

‘ ple worldwide and is a major cause of liver cancer and

cirrhosis, and the form known as non A non B, a cur-
rently indetectable contaminant of blood transfusxons
that also causes cirrhosis. Chimpanzees are the only ani-
mals other than humans that become infected With
hepatitis, but it does not make them “ill; most research
involves blood sampling and liver biopSies. .

Dozens of chimpanzees have already been used in
research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome,
and they will be killed for safety. As with hepatitis,
chimpanzees are the only known animal the AIDS Virus
can infect, but they do not develop the deadlysyndrome.
Scientists expect chimpanzees will be essential for test-
ing possible anti-AIDS vaccines. Chimpanzees .are also
seen as uniquely suited for certain researchnon immuno-
logical disorders, reproduction and behaVior.

 




“Twenty years ago no one could have predicted that
we would need chimpanzees so badly for hepatitis re-
search,” said Dr. Jan Moor-Jankowski, director of New
York University’s Laboratory for Experimental Medi-
cine and Surgery in Primates (LEMSIP). He endorsed
the federal proposal, saying, “We can’t know ’how many
chimps we’ll need in the future, but if we don t have any

we can’t go back.”

Chimpanzees in the proposed new breeding colonies

would not be used in any research that could threaten
their medical integrity or mental health. Rearing prac-
tices intended to improve their reproductive perform-
ance would be followed.

In the past, many primate centers have taken new-
born chimpanzees away from their mothers at birth or
soon after so the mothers can reproduce again more

3% quickly. While this has yielded more offspring in the

short term, it also has produced a generation of abnor-
mal, sexually inept animals, scientists say.
_In the wild, young chimpanzees grow up watching

: their elders mating, nursing and raising infants, and
they develop strong bonds with siblings as they play and
learn together. “We now know that without this normal
social development, chimps are not effective breeders,”
said Thomas Wolﬂe, a veterinarian with the National In-
" stitutes of Health who has helped develop the new na- _
itional strategy.

In part'the problem is that the socially deprived ani-

mals never learn how to copulate or care for infants. An
excited male “will try to mount the female, but he won’t
.know where to start,” said Wolﬂe. “And the inept fe-
?males will jerk away anyway.” Females that do give

birth may neglect their infants, refuse to breastfeed
them or throw them violently.

But the poor breeding performance stems more
from psychological damage than from ignorance, many
scientists believe. “What’s missing in these animals is

' self-confidence,” said Dr. James Mahoney, chief of

reproduction at LEMSIP. “And to gain that confidence
they need a mother’s love.”

Some of the young females “actually scream at the
approach of a male,” said Dr. Mahoney, while others try
to divert an excited male’s attention by grooming him

furiously until he forgets what he came for. Some males

seem to lack any desire to copulate at all.
Intense research on the biology and psychology of

.: chimpanzee reproduction and on techniques of artificial 1;

insemination, which has shown little success so‘ far, will

also be pursued as part of the national plan.

Federal officials say they do not expect to subsidize

breeder chimpanzees indefinitely. Rather, their goal is
to provide “seed money” for the renovation of cages and ,
if liVing facilities, for initial maintenance of the breeders:
if and for research on chimpanzee reproduction and in”?
fant socialization. Over time, they say, those who use

animals in research projects, who customarily “rent”
the animals on a temporary basis from permanent pri-
mate facilities, should begin paying much higher fees
that reﬂect the true costs of raising a chimpanzee and

Keeping a chimpanzee costs about $5,000 a year.
Over its 30 to 50 year lifespan, then, an animal’s mainte-
nance ranges from $150,000 to $250,000.

Economic questions have come to the fore as more
chimpanzees, now some 250 of them, have been used in
research on the non A non B form of hepatitis. Following
such experiments, the animals and their offspring must
be sequestered from “clean” chimpanzees for life. Some
have gone into behavioral experiments and some are .
now used in AIDS research, but many of the compro-
mised animals are not wanted by experimenters.

The quest continues for a test that can reveal which
of the research veterans carry the hepatitis virus. Mean-
while, that very search, which is of great import for
human health, contaminates 50 more animals every
year.

Wranglers
take stock
of burros

More than 4,000 wild
burros have been
rounded up in Death
Valley for relocation.

By RONALD B. TAYLOR
Los Angeles Times

DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL
MONUMENT, Calif. — Charging
Wildly across the rugged desert on
horseback, hard-riding wranglers
are lassoing the last of the Death
Valley wild burros and dragging
them into captivity.

Assisted by a helicopter, the
ropers have captured more than
4,000 burros in two years and expect
toround up the final 2,000 by win-
ter’s end, concluding a $1.2 million
effort to rid the monument of the

cute but pesky descendants of North

African jackasses.

The burros range from Eagle
Borax Spring, 280 feet below sea
level, to the top of 11,000 foot Tele-
scope Peak. Rangers expect that a
few will escape capture by hiding in
the most remote, forbidding re-
cesses of the 2-million-acre monu-
ment.

The job is made doubly tough be-
cause, unlike cattle or horses, burros
refuse to be herded. Riding tough
desert mustangs captured in the wild
and trained especially for this work,
four young cowboys and their taci-
turn boss wrangler, Gene Nunn,
must rope the burros one at a time.

On a recent blustery day, the

.crew was working in far-off Hidden

Valley. A cold wind was blowing as
helicopter pilot Delbert Lawson, 59,
took off with Nunn riding scout.
They ﬂew high up into the canyons
and near the peaks, searching out
springs where the burros water.
They sighted six burros, and the
work began.
' Using horns, sirens and the pop-
ping turbulence of the rotor blades,
the—pilot drove the fuzzy, black bur-
ros out of a gulch and down the
mountain into flats where the wran-
glers waited on their horses, ropes
ready.

“‘It’s hard to catch them if they-
’re running downhill, so when they

Wild burros, once the scourge of Death Valley,

get close, the pilot’s got to tumthem,
head them up for us,” explained
John Hlebica, 23, a cowboy from
Northern California who recently
signed on with Nunn for $8 an hour,
a high wage for cowboys.

A walkie-talkie tied to the back
of Hlebica’s saddle squawked out a
warning: “They’re comin’
way.”

Out of sight in an arroyo, the
cawboys waited until the burros
popped up over the ridge and
dropped down into the arroyo. The
chase was on. Running at breakneck
speed, dodging spiny Joshua trees
and rocks, lunging up steep banks
and down into guiches, the wran-
glers whirled and threw their ropes,
each trying to lasso a burro by the
neck.

It is dangerous work. Only the
day before, Paul Valdon’s horse was
galloping when it stepped into a bur-

. row, stumbled and fell, rolling over

the young cowboy. Neither the rider
nor the horse was injured and both
were quickly up and continuing the
chase.

On this day, a hard-riding Phil‘

Zamora, 42, had just got his rope on
a big burro when the beast ducked
around one side of a tree. Zamora’s
horse ran around the other side,
hanging up the rope in the tree. Be-
fore Zamora could let go, the rope
was jerked from the saddle horn,
burning a painful welt across his
hand.

The burro, free again, but with
Zamora’s rope trailing behind, was

your .

roped a second time by Tim Zaun,
28, a snuff-dipping Wyoming cow-
boy. Zaun got the burro stopped and
he and Zamora threw it to the
ground, fashioned a rope bridle and
then dragged it two miles to a corral.

After long hours in the saddle,
Nun and his crew had roped 23 bur-
ros, loaded them onto trailers and
hauled them down to desert camp
corrals a few miles away. It was not
a good day. “We usually get 40 or
50,” Nunn said as he unsaddled.

The big roundup of Death Valley
burros has not been without contro-
versy. Some burros caught last year
were put up for adoption, others
were auctioned to buyers who
agreed not to harm or kill them. But
several truckloads were shipped to
an Oregon slaughterhouse. Embar-
rassed federal officials acknowledge
that as many as 700 burros may
have been killed in. violation of the
sales agreements.

Closely watched by animal pro-
tection groups, federal officials here

‘and elsewhere are keeping a closer

watch on the buyers. They are hop-
ing that, as the final groups of burros
are chased down out of the hills,"
loaded into trucks and hauled away,
the half-century-old burro dispute
will finally come to an end.

The controversy hinges on the
burro’ 5 image as the grizzled desert
prospector’s faithful beast of burden
vs. the harsh reality that these hardy
creatures thrive and multiply rap-
idly in the American desert, upset-
ting fragile ecosystems and threat-

await removal to an animal adoption center' m

ening the existence of the desert big
horn sheep.

As the burros populated Death
Valley, they ate much of the feed on
which the sheep depend and domi-
nated the scarce water holes. Rang-
ers estimate that where there were
once thousands of desert big horns,
there now are only a few hundred.

Burros were introduced into the
West by Spanish explorers, and the
little beasts of burden were widely
used by prospectors until they were
replaced by Model-A Fords in the
1930s _

For years, rangers in Death Val-
ley and Grand Canyon National
Park shot burros, when the herds be-
came too large. The Bureau of Land
Management practiced similar
“herd reduction” throughout the ,
West until passage of the Wild Horse
and Burro Act of 1971 prevented fur-
ther killing.

National parks were excluded
from the act and by 1978 National
Parks Director William Whalen de-
cided “to get rid of the burros” be-
cause of the environmental damage
they were causing. The only ques-
tion was how.

Shooting was the Park Service’s
preferred method, but infuriated
animal-protection groups filed suits
in federal courts, demanding that a
more humane system be worked out.
Pressured by the public outcry, the
park service finally agreed to let the
nonprofit protection groups help
round up and evacuate 600 Grand
Canyon burros by helicopter in 1980.

Feline infectious .
peritonitis spreads
quickly among cats,
but not always fatal

Dear Dr. Shall-

 

non: We recently
lost our 3-year-old
cat to feline infec-
, tious peritonitis
' (FIP). Needless to
say, .we were hearts
broken. Do you -
have any informa-
tion on'the osusesor 5 ‘
prevention of this
disease?

Also, {spoke with the animal
shelterconcerning adopting anoth-
er kitten; but they didn’t want me
to do so because of the possibility
of infectious germs in the house .
and yard, and pessiblyinfectious
cats in”the neighborhood.

Would you please comment
about this disease. Will I ever be
able ’to have anoﬂier cat?

Deer Bender: Feline infectious
peritonitis (FIP) is a Viral disease
of domestic and wild cats. A great
majority of infected cats will re-
cover completely and are then im-
mune to the disease. ‘
believe the FTP virus to

d among the cat pop-
ulation. ' ' -

‘ The term “peritonitis” is de-
fined as an inﬂammation of the
peritoneum, which is the mem-
brane lining the abdominal and
pelvic walls. But the name is this-
leading because the disease is not
restricted to the peritoneum and it
is not infectious in the same way
most diseases are.

The FIP virus is believed to be
quickly and easily spread among
cats; but the majority only devel-
op a transient, relatively mild up-
per respiratory infection.

A small number of FIP-infected
cats develop a secondary disease
which may occur weeks or months
after the initial exposure; this is
the fatal form of the disease. .

Your cat obviously had the fa-
tal, secondary form.

This is a chronic, progressive,
weakening, feverish, antibiotic-re-
sistant, serious disease character-
ized by inﬂammation of the linings
of the chest and abdominal cavi-
ties and often accompanied by
large accumulations of ﬂuid in
these cavities. - ' .

Veterinarians are often asked
what determines which cats will
develop the fatal form of FIP,
which cats will become carriers
and which cats will recover com.-
pletely.

There are few definitive an-
swers as several factors have to be
considered such as the virulence of
the disease; the animal's heredi-
tary predisposition to disease: nu-
tritional problems causing a low-
ered resistance to infection;
various concurrent illnesses such ‘
as intestinal parasites, ear infec-"
tions and ectoparasites; and vari-
ous stress factors that may affect
cats. " ’

Exactly how the naturally oc-
curring disease is transmitted is
not clearly defined; however, FIP
has been experimentally transmit-
ted by mouth and injection using
abdominal ﬂuid, blood, urine and
tissues from cats with the natural-
ly occurring disease.

The incubation period of the hat-
urally occurring disease is un-
known.

But with experimentally trans-
mitted FIP virus, the incubation
period is two days to two weeks.
Assuming FIP is contagious, it is

 

 

Veterinarians say most cats exposed to feline infectious
peritonitis (FIP) virus do not get the disease. FIP, occurs

not highly so, and prolonged con-
tact between cats seems to be re-
quired for transmission.

The FIP virus does not survive
for long periods of time outside the
cat, and for this reason one need
only wait a few weeks before intro-
ducing a new cat into a household
which formerly housed an affected
cat.

Please keep in mind that most
cats exposed to FIP virus do not
get the. disease. FIP occurs pri-

marily in either young cats (under-

3 years) or older ones (over 10
years).

There is no vaccine for feline in-
fectious peritonitis. I recommend
that you get another cat. Provide
your cat with proper nutrition;
consult your veterinarian concern-
ing vaccines for the various viral
diseases such as panleukopenia,
calici, rhinotracheitis, leukemia
and rabies; establish a regular in-
ternal / external parasite control
program; and provide as little
stress for the new cat as possible.
Thank you. '

An Introduction to
the California Dog

“The greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be
judged by tlte way its animals are treated.”

—Gandhi

“Hes young, lze’s liot, lze’s a poodle for today.”
-Variety

BY TOM CHRISTIE

HE DOG, AS we know it, more
or less, endeared itself to man
some time ago. The most
outstanding feature of the
Paleolithic period was the development
of Homo sapiens, i.e., us; and although
such seeming essentials as speech, ﬁre,
and toolmaking were also developed in
this, the longest period of human his-
tory, surely the second most outstand-
ing feature was the domestication of
Canis familiaris-the ﬁrst and only ani-
mal or plant domesticated in man’s ﬁrst
two million years. Pictures of dogs can
be found in the art of the ancient em-
pires of Egypt and Assyria, and Greece
and Rome had dogs resembling modern
breeds. 'Wherever great civilizations
rose and tell, dogs ﬂourished and left
their mark. Britain has Barbara Wood-
house, for instance; France, Le Theatre
pour Ghien; and New York, the Dog
Museum. Then came California. Not
even the great Mahatma foresaw that.
In early San Francisco, dogs, like
many people, ran wild and received
much recognition for it. Prominent

 

Tom Christie is a Los Angeles writer who

proﬁled Meg Tilly in the September issue.

among these was the celebrated duo of
Bummer and Lazarus, who literally had
the run of the city during the 18605
when, after citizens signed a petition,
the board of supervisors exempted them
from those laws applying to lowly curs.
The two were always welcomed (and
fed) in the saloons, and their exploits—
such as the killing of 85 waterfront rats
in a period of twenty minutes—were
widely reported in the city’s newspapers.
As were their deaths, which greatly sad-
dened the citizens, among them the
young Mark Twain, who dispatched an
obituary to the Virginia City Territorial
Enterprise: “The old vagrant Bummer is
really dead at last.. . .He died full of
years, and honor, and disease, and
ﬂeas.” Both dogs were stuffed for occa-
sional public display and were last seen
in 1910 in Golden Gate Park, which was
to become, some 65 years later, the site
of the nation’s ﬁrst canine comfort
station.

In Los Angeles, dogs reached the
apex of American society—they became
movie stars. A former German army
dog named Rin Tin Tin became one of
the biggest box-ofﬁce draws of the silent
screen, while a male collie played the fe-

 

 




male Lassie in several successful movies
beginning with Lassie Come Home in
1943. Both dogs later received stars on
Hollywood’s Walk of Fame, an honor
without a known equal in the modern
world. In turn, the movies spawned
such memorable literary events as
Scruf/ﬁz: The Adventures of a Mongrel in
Movieland by Claude Burbidge and
Macdonald Daly’s Jasper the TV Pup.
And until the 1976 release of Won Ybn
Ybn, the Dog V/ho Saved Hollywood (it
didn’t), no dog picture on record had
failed to make money. In return, Holly-
wood had given the dog something it
had never had before: income beyond
its wildest dreams. It was a match made
in heaven.

Today, basically, California is dog
heaven. If you have enough money—
and too many people here do—there is
virtually nothing the world has to offer
that cannot be purchased for your pet.
You name it, we’ve got it, from frozen
gourmet dinners and water beds to con-

\k‘»\ 12/—

tact lenses and orthodontic braces to
psychologists and baby-sitters to
cosmetic surgery, punk hairdos, and
artiﬁcial insemination. There’s even a
dog sperm bank. And not only is this
stuff readily available, but it sells. Boy,
does it ever. Nowhere else in the world
is the spectrum of products and ser-
vices so wide. Nowhere is so much
money spent on keeping dogs physi-
cally and psychologically ﬁt. Nowhere
but nowhere are so many dogs so close
to existing on a pseudohuman level.
Well, maybe in New York.

Mr. and Mrs. Carl C. Harwin of Beverly
Hills have ﬁled an $11,000 suit against
fourteen-year-old Linda Sohenek who, thgz
claim, while doing acrobatics at the Harwin
home, ffell atop” and killed their toy French
poodle Mona Lisa (who earned 135 a day
playing Mitzi Gaynor} pet in The I Don’t
Care Girl).

OWN IN FOUNTAIN Valley,

just off the San Diego Free-

way, past the HOME OF THE

FOUNTAIN VALLEY JAYCEES,
ESTABLISHED 1964 sign, around the
bend and across Talbert Avenue from
the lettuce and celery ﬁelds, stands the
ASU warehouse. Starting at about 8
A.M. each weekday morning, ASU’s
fleet of 24-foot bobtail trucks heads out
for deliveries across Southern Califor-
nia, from Fresno to the Mexican bor-
der. Inside a second-ﬂoor room, sitting
around a conference table, are some of
ASU’s 22 salespeople, drinking coffee,
chatting, talking to clients on one of
several phones, or referring to a huge,
pin-studded wall map of Los Angeles
and Orange counties. A window in the
room overlooks the warehouse where
row upon row of shelving is stacked
twenty feet high with 10,000 individual
products. And outside the room stands
a large trophy given to Keith Bonner
by his employees, grateful for\ the

 




 

growth of their company from what
was primarily a small aquarium-supply
house in 1973 to one of the largest pet
supply distributors in the country—a
period in which the ASU warehouse
grew from 2,000 to 48,000 square feet.
The pet business—particularly the
dog end of it—is big business in Cali-
fornia. With just 10 percent of the
population, the state commands—de-
pending on whom you talk to—any-
where from 20 to 35 percent of the
U.S. market. What does that mean in
dollars? Of the $5 billion spent on pet
foods in the United States in 1984, $1.7
billion went toward dry dog food alone.
Which means that at least $340 million
worth of Puppy Chow and Gravy
Train, et al., was sold in California. It
ain’t Lockheed o‘r Northrop or Hewlett-
Packard, to be sure, but we’re talking
dog food here. Not so long ago, that
meant meat scraps from the butcher.
Gone are the days of the mom-and-
pop pet store; the few left—like small-

bookstore owners —are today facing far
more sophisticated competition. The
new pet stores are cleaner and better
ventilated, stocked, and ﬁnanced. And
the products and their packaging are
themselves more sophisticated than
they have been in the past. The result
is that not only are pets getting better
care, but the way their owners buy
food and supplies is changing. Al-
though most people still buy at their
local grocery store, there is a growing
movement toward larger specialty pet
stores that sell no animals and even pet
food supermarkets that are able to offer
a greater variety at a better price.
An-jan Feed and Pet Supply in San
Jose is the country’s single largest in-
dependent seller of Ralston-Purina dog
foods, to the tune of ﬁve truckloads——
or about 5,000 bags—per month.
Owner John Rademakers, whose
operation includes 52 employees, a
14,400-square-foot retail space com-
plete with shopping carts, eight aisles,
and seven cash registers, says he also
sells about 6,000 cases of Kal Kan

canned dog food every month. Arid in
San Diego and Orange counties, there
are now eighteen Petco Animal Sup-
plies supermarkets. What began in
1965 as a mail-order discount outlet for
professionals now sells about 175,000
bags of dog food to the public each year
and has a total annual sales volume of
$14 million. '

But it’s not just the physical aspects
of pet stores that are changing; the phi-
losophies are different as well. One Los
Angeles store owner has simply stopped
using the term pet store. “We call it an
animal service center.” says Elaine Ir-
ving of Petville USA. The store, er,
service center itself is fairly conven-
tional, save for the aisles called Animal
Avenue, Feline Freeway, Hamster
Heights, and East and West Dog drives
(which have everything to “answer
your dog’s needs from bad breath to
puppy piddle pads”). Which is to say
that it looks like a pet store and they sell
animals there, sort of. Irving doesn’t
like to use the words buy and sell either;

{‘1

at Petville, the acquisition of an animal
is an “adoption.” When you “adopt” an
animal at Petville, reads a brochure,
“be prepared for the ‘adoption bell’
ringing tradition. We announce to ev-
eryone in the shop that you have
adopted a new member to your family
and when the bell starts ringing, all
staff members will interrupt whatever
they are doing for a moment to cheer

school prepares those accepted “for a
career with animals and their humans.”
The course, which costs the student
3500, covers a large range of topics,
from “\Nhat About the Mutt?” and
“Food for Guinea Pigs” to “When Your
Pet Grows Old: Developing a Deep
Understanding of the Life Process.”
Los Angeles still has not a few of
those traditionally unusual stores that

s

dresses and tuxedos custom made, sells
imitation mink jackets, ski parkas,
western shirts, blue jean/sheepskin
jackets and a $175 leather backpack.
And if your dog is Jewish or a baseball
fan, you can find a yarmulke or a
Dodgers cap at the Feed Rite Pet Shop
in Farmer’s Market, not to mention
rubber boots.

An Orange Coungl judge has found a divorced
couple in contempt and sent both to jail for
violating a court order over the custody of
Runaway, the family dog. Superior Court
judge john C. Woolley ordered Ronald Rex
Wheatland, 34, to one day in the Orange
County Jail and his ex-wifeJudy G. Sulli-
van, 3], to two days. “I give you both very
low marks as human beings, ” concluded the
judge, who in September of the previous year
found the dog — valued at $25 -— to be a “child
substitute” for the childless couple. He ordered
that each have custody of Runaway in alter-
nate months. Wheatland complained that
Sullivan failed to turn the dog over to him in
December. Sullivan countered that Wheatland
had endangered Runaway’s life by allowing
the cockapoo mix to injure its leg and to be
impregnated by a golden retriever “two to three
times”Runaway’s size. But V/heatland, who
said the jail term was worth it “because I love
the dog, ’ insisted Runaway had been impreg-

, nated by a mere four-pound poodle. ,

Marina del Rey written all over:his
42-year-old styled hair, monogrammed
gold cuff links, and cream-colored
leather loafers, is talking to a client in
the office he shares with his partner, Dr.
Richard Gebhart. With its cushy carpet
and comfy couch, black louvered mini
blinds, textured wallpaper, and framed
photos of ducks, it’s not your average
veterinarian’s ofﬁce. But then, the West
Los Angeles Veterinary Medical Group
is not your average animal hospital.

Opened in April 1984, the $3 million
facility located on Sepulveda Boulevard’s
veterinary row is the largest 24-hour-a-
day operation of its kind in California
and one of the largest in the country.
Of the 85 employees, 17 are veterinar-
ians, including two surgeons, two oph-
thalmologists, and two internists—all
board certiﬁed. It sounds overambi-
tious until you learn that of the 33,000
clients with active charts in the massive
ﬁling system, each of which translates
into one-and-a-half animals, 150 pay
the hospital a visit every day.

The group’s two working ﬂoors, situ-
ated atop a twenty-space parking ga-
rage, house thirteen examination
rooms ﬁtted with a two-station lighting
system telling staff if 1) the room is in
use, 2) doctor needs assistance, 3) the
room needs cleanup, or 4) client can
move directly to the cashier. There are
two large surgery suites, a $100,000
special procedures radiology suite, a
$25,000 ultrasound unit, a ﬁber-optic
endoscopy, an isolation room for
contagious animals, an intensive care
cage (with oxygen, temperature, and
humidity controls), ten boardirig,
grooming and hospital wards with 288
cages, eight electronic dog and cat
driers, a pharmacy, a mail room, a
phone center for doctors to call clients,
an outpatient treatment room, an
employee lunchroom, men’s and
women’s showers, and a library/confer-
ence room.

The costs of such an operation are
immense—about $8,000 a day. Sev-
edge admits that he needs (and has) an
afﬂuent client base made up of people
who will spend money to keep their
dogs healthy or alive following an acci-
dent. If, for instance, a dog is hit by a
car and requires spinal surgery, it’s go-
ing to cost its owners about $1,000.
Yet, Sevedge laments what he terms
the veterinarian’s predicament: “We
have to buy the same equipment as
M.D.s, and our specialists have the
same training as M.D.s. We’re in a
high-tech profession, but we can’t
charge the same kind of fees [as M.D.s
do].” Oh, well, at least he gets to drive .
the same kind of car M.D.s do. Parked .
in the best (most noticeable) spaces in
front of the hospital, as if it were a res-

 

Wagger Bagger ($12), and my personal
favorite, the Pick Up Poop kit, which
contains a tote bag (on the side of
which reads CONSIDERATE CANINE—

gesture that an afﬂuent L.A. client base
will understand and appreciate.

Los Angeles also offers a wide va-
riety of veterinary services that in
many other places might be considered
slightly unusual. The San Fernando
Valley, for instance, is home to both a
licensed holistic vet and a veterinary
acupuncturist, not to mention Dr.
Alexandra Schuttais, a former psychic
healer turned “holistic veterinarius na-
turopath.” Schuttais, who says she has
a Ph.D. in naturopathy and philosophy
(“From where?” “From Scottsdale, Ari-
zona”), does not diagnose illness but
rather advises pet owners on‘ proper
nutrition and environment as well as
occasionally healing dogs by the laying
on of hands. And several people are
offering dog-sitting services, which
usually involve feeding while the owner
is on holiday. But one woman told me
she has a couple of clients who call her
when they’re going out for just a few
hours.

Dr. Burton Roe of Oxnard has been
practicing veterinary dentistry for the
past twenty years mainly with show
dogs, but in the past few years, he says,
the public has begun to ask for more.
“Animals have become even more a
part of the family than they used to be.
A lot of people want you to do as much
for their pets as you would for them.
They’re the kind of people you base
your practice on—people who’ll let you
go all the way.” Going all the way in
this case means root canals, which Roe
says is getting to be routine, the repair
of broken and crooked teeth (with
orthodontics that can cost up to $1,000)
as well as regular cleaning and extrac-
tions. He also repairs a lot of show
dogs’ underbites.

Nose jobs aren’t in yet, but show
dogs have been known to wear tinted
contact lenses to improve their eye color.
And while it is only talked of in-hushed
tones, cosmetic surgery of an entirely
weird sort occurs more often than one
'would think, according to a number of
groomers I spoke with. Although strictly
forbidden 'in'the‘ eyes of the American
Kennel Club (AKC), the implantation
of phony testicles in neutered dogs is
quite common—usually but not always
in show dogs. “Some people,” said one
woman groomer, “just don’t Want their
little male dogs to look like they don’t
have balls.”

But stranger things do happen. Take,
for instance, the case of the lhasa apso
who is not at all amused by its owners’
lovemaking. It seems the dog doesn’t
even like it when the man kisses his
wife. It begins to growl then, in warn-
ing of further and more stringent ac-
tion it’s willing to take. The couple,
presumably in the throes of passion
(else why not simply throw the dog out-
side and lock the door?), ignores the

warning. So the lhasa apso does the
unthinkable - it steals the man’s under-
wear. Now, one can imagine the couple
getting a laugh out of their dog’s un-
seemly behavior the ﬁrst, maybe the
second, time. After that it must have
become less and less amusing. And,
ﬁnally, having undoubtedly tried all

sorts of remedies without success, the ,
sheepish couple turns in desperation to ,

Dr. Richard Polsky.

Polsky’s Animal Behavior Counsel-
ing Services are structured like that of a
human psychologist’s, with in- and out:
patient services. Most of his clients are
outpatients (it’s cheaper), paying $75 to
$95 for an initial evaluative consulta-
tion usually followed by a $135 at-home
visit. (If housebreaking is your dog’s
problem, $150 to $200 covers a house
call and follow-up visits.) It may seem
like a lot, but the 38-year-old animal
behaviorist, whose education includes
a doctorate in animal behavior from
the University of Leicester in England,
followed by a faculty position at the
University of Birmingham, England,
and a postdoctoral fellowship in the
department of psychiatry and bio-
behavioral sciences at UCLA, doesn’t
think he charges enough. .

What does he do, exactly? It’s some-
thing akin to tan at-home therapy ses-
sion with a small child. First of all, he
attempts to get a case history of the
dog, which, since it can’t speak, can be
a little difﬁcult. He begins with the
dog’s age, sex, health, neutering, food
regimen, and last vet checkup, and
then tries to get the owner to illuminate
a typical day in the dog’slife. Although
Polsky will occasionally take on a par-
ticularly tough case himself (a man
recently shipped his two unruly ger-
man shepherds to Polsky’s Culver City
office for two months’ careful attention
at a cost of $5,000), normally the
owners are the agents of change, work-
ing with behavior modiﬁcation tech-
niques he teaches them. Interestingly
enough, these are the very same tech-
niques originally developed on
laboratory dogs for use on children
with learning disabilities. One such
technique, called time out, simply in-
volves putting a misbehaving puppy
into a dark closet for three or four
minutes. Another sureﬁre method he
suggests for getting your dog to stay
away from, say, a certain piece of fur-
niture is to set a mousetrap near it.

Polsky is no dog coddler. He himself
is constantly amazed by the degree of
unbelievable behavior that people will
put up with from their pets, he says,
behavior that compromises their life-
styles. He believes that his overall suc-
cess rate of 75 to 80 percent with the
routine cases that make up the majority
of his business—those involving ag—
gression or separation problems, urina-

tion, and excessive barking—would in-
crease if some of his clients weren’t
such “total f — ups.” You get the feel-
ing that Polsky doesn’t like a lot of his
clients. But it’s understandable. Right
now, he’s working with a man whose
dog won’t let him leave the house.

Hollywood is probably the greatest town of

dog lovers in the world. Almost every player

has from one to four or ﬁve canine pets.
—Paramount press release for

The Biscuit Eater, March 18, 1940

Director William Keighley picked a “sad little
mutt” from the city animal shelter today to ap~
pear with Errol Flynn in Rocky Moun-
tain. Keighley said he went to the shelter
because he wanted a dog “without any precon-

—Los Angeles Times, May 18, 1950

HE END OF Hollywood’s glory
days is nowhere more ap-
parent than in its fund-
raising affairs for dogs. In
September 1938, Life magazine covered
a glamorous black-tie fund-raising party
thrown by the Tailwaggers Society.
Rhotos showed the hostess, Bette Davis,
with no less than Howard Hughes,
Jimmy Stewart, Norma Shearer, Joel
McCrea, David O. Selznick, Henry
Fonda, and Randolph Scott. In Septem-
ber 1985, Bert Convey and Gary Owens

cohosted the Amanda Foundation’s
celebrity fashion show at the Beverly
Hills Hotel. Among the featured models
were Cheryl Ladd, Tawny Schneider,
Ken Norton, Cassandra Peterson
(a.k.a. Elvira), Tony Danza, Catherine
Oxenberg, Jamie Farr, Vanessa
Williams (no kidding), and Lassie.
Maybe it’s because there are so many
animal welfare groups ﬁghting for LA.
dollars these days—Actors and Others
for Animals, Pet Adoption, Pet
Assistance, the Holiday Humane So-
ciety, Pet Rescue Association, the Pet
Protection Society, the Delta Society,
and, of course, the Amanda Founda—
tion. Or maybe it’s just because
Hollywood has left the glamorizing to
TV stars. At any rate, somewhere along
the line, dogs lost their sex appeal in
L.A., as Mary Jo Greenberg will tell
you.

“There’s nothing chic about these
organizations, so you’re not going to at-
tract the [society] ladies,” she says. “And
Jody Jacobs isn’t going to write you up
in the Times.” And, too, the rivalry for
LA. dollars among the various organi-
zations is said to be ﬁerce. So much so,
apparently, that Greenberg, the wife of
former Detroit Tiger slugger Hank
Greenberg, has resorted to blackmail of
a sort. People who write to her husband
requesting autographs—and there are a
lot of them—now receive a response

 

 

 




that reads in part, “Dear Hank
Greenberg Fan: Mr. Greenberg has
long been a supporter of the Pet Adop-
tion Fund and requests that, in return
for his autograph, you make a 35 tax-
deductible contribution to this chari-
table organization.” It’s tough, this
fund-raising business, especially when
dogs are involved. “If Cedars-Sinai has
a fund-raiser,” says Greenberg, “they
won’t ﬁnd 30 bodies at their door the
next morning, but if we have one we’ll
get 30 dogs.” But that doesn’t stop Earl
Holliman and his group from providing
one of the more entertaining fund-
raisers known to man.

“I was born in the Valley,” booms
Cindy Williams’s voice from speakers
atop the KRTH-F M mobile unit, which
is parked in the driveway of the Scarecrow
and Mrs. King house on the Burbank
Ranch. “See her? She’s right over there,
Mom. Mom, right over there!” whines a
teenage girl, pointing to a young
woman stepping from the motor home a
moment later with a green and white
sticker stuck to her left breast that ap-
pears to say HELL, MY NAME IS CINDY
WILLIAMS. As the frenzied crowd sur-
rounds her, a little black girl asks her
father, “Is that Cindy’s house?”

The tenth Actors and Others for
Animals Celebrity Fair is well under
way on a hot Sunday afternoon in July.
Thousands of people are milling about
the old backlot on Hollywood Way
about four blocks north of the Burbank
Studios. The main thoroughfare, which
circles a. grassy park and in the process
goes from a suburban residential street
to a sort of Boston-like city street, is to-
day lined with dozens of booths offering
everything from hot dogs to Cabbage
Patch dolls to bronzed paw prints.
Oddly enough, a sign at the entrance
gate reads SORRY, NO PETS and the only
animals around are a gigantic Styro-
foam Tyrannosaurus rex and the many
golden-fried chickens on the grill over at
the Pioneer Chicken booth. (A barmer
proclaims A PORTION OF ALL PROCEEDS
TO NTKHG NWDCNTERSITW.ANL
MALS, and no one, apparently too busy
eating animals or ogling celebrities or
both, sees the irony.) But like everyone
else, I’m excited, for the place is crawl-
ing with celebrities and other extremely
fascinating people.

There’s Peter Lupus actually kissing
an autograph‘ hunter! And there’s Le-
nore Estrin, you know, the “nationally
known certiﬁed scriptologist who has
appeared on radio, TV, and the Media!”
And here comes a woman with a gold
glitter-dusted, dyed~brunette ﬂoppy
beehive hairdo and extremely large
thighs wearing bright pink shorts and
matching knee socks and a T-shirt read-
ing 1 LOVE MARINES. But the real action
is taking place in a large chain-link
fenced-in area at the east end of the lot

146 DECEMBER 1985

 

 

where a sort of Ma Maison of the Valley
has been set up. Oodles of television ac-
tors are sitting at numbered tables, and
for only $3 fans can enter and actually
interface with their fave celebs. Even
better, they can have their pictures
taken with them. A large sign at the
rear—a sort of marquee—cum-small-
town baseball stadium scoreboard — tells
what celebrities are sitting where. Pat—
rick Wayne is at table number one, for
instance, Cesar Romero and Lee Meri-
wether are at number two, and Gavin
MacLeod is at the number four table.
Barry Bostwick and Melody Thomas,
Ted Shackelford, Denver Pyle, jack
jones, and Earl Holliman are there too.
And here comes Peter Falk in his Rolls-
Royce. “Peter! Peter!” cries a woman
who clearly misses Elvis.

Nearby, in dark contrast to the celeb-
rity mania, is a row of booths manned
by animal welfare organizations, some
of which sell innocent goods such as The
Cookbook for People Who Love Animals
(vegetarian) or cutesy dog and cat
cards. But many have posted terrible
photographs of dogs and cats and
bunnies tortured and mutilated by indi-
viduals and medical or cosmetic re-

searchers. Like most people today, I

walk through this morbid—albeit well-
intentioned—gauntlet quickly and seek
out more celebrities. I ﬁnd them—vi-
cariously at any rate—under the large
auction tent where some guy is just
plunking down $50 for a pair of Laurel
and Hardy coin banks autographed and
donated by Gavin MacLeod. Then one
of the real prizes is sold. It is the cobalt
blue pure silk gown designed by Nolan
Miller for Linda Evans in, episode 58 of
Dynasty, in which she and Joan Collins
“fought like cats” and wound up in the
lily pond. It was, assures the auctioneer,
“a very famous scene,” and a man wins
the coveted memorabile with 'a whop-
ping bid of $1,250.

The day progressed just so, getting
more and more entertaining, so much
so that I went home and picked up my
wife and brought her back—a mistake,
as it turned out. She headed straight for
the thrift tent and emerged 30 minutes
later with a really horrible plaster lamp
donated by Jo Anne Worley of the one-
ton-barely—clothed-Greek—maiden-with-
urn ilk and two paperbacks: Teddy Bare:
The Real Story of Chappaquiddick and
Tough and Tender: What Every I'Voman
wants in a Man. In the meantime, I was
in line with about twenty little girls and
two tattooed ladies wearing Seabees
T-shirts waiting to get a Madonna
Wanna Be’s autograph. She was one of
a troupe of rock star look-alike lip
synchers—Chaka Khan, Prince and
Sheila E. , Stevie Wonder, and
DeBarge—who had just ﬁnished per-
forming on a stage in the park. “Tom,
thanks so much, Madonna Wanna Be,”

 

8 .
she wrote. “It’s for my little boy,” I lied.

Later, as the sun set over Burbank,
and the polka band Rotondi sang
“Polka Changed My Life Today,” and
Knight Rider’s David Hasselhoﬂ strode
past me trailing a horde of crazed, dol-
lar—bill-waving autograph hounds, over
the loudspeaker came, “Will someone
volunteer to take Peter Falk to the
bathroom?”

S A SLIGHT breeze breaks the

sun’s glare a little, setting

hundreds of plastic sunﬂower

pinwheels to spinning, a
Latino groundsman interrupts a
pulsating sprinkler’s tick-tick-ticking
and moves it deftly through the more
than 22,000 grave markers to a dry
spot on this ﬁve-acre plot of green on
South Figueroa Avenue. The graves are
dressed garishly with red “memory
lites,” little American ﬂags, madonnas,
and multicolored plastic ﬂowers, giving
the place the look of a Woolworth’s
Veterans’ Day sale. In one corner of the
cemetery sits an elderly woman, in a
chair above a newly covered grave,
rocking forward and back, forward and
back, occasionally making the sign of
the cross. Not far from her, on the spot
from which the groundsman took his
sprinkler, glistening wet, is a grave
marker that reads:

OUR BELOVED SON
1/22/68-1/4/70
CHARLIE HORTON
DARLING WE SHALL ALWAYS MISS you
MOM AND DAD.

To bury Charlie Horton today at
Pet Haven Memorial Cemetery and
Crematory in Gardena, a small suburb
due south of downtown Los Angeles,
would cost anywhere from $240 to
$485, depending upon his size. (A
hamster will run you $95.) And that’s
just for the grave site, satin-lined
casket, and ﬂower holder. Granite
markers run from $98 to $175, a
memory lite installed is an additional
$75, and you can add an aluminum
photo or granite etching of your pet for
another 330. Plus tax. So a basic burial
for Charlie is going to run about $500,
including an extra $50 for 50 letters
beyond the allowed 35. A really big dog
could cost you a cool thousand.

Contrary to public perceptions and
the recent California Cooler television
ads, there are few pet cemeteries in
California. As a matter of fact, Dr.
Wendell C. Morse of South Bend, In-
diana, executive director of the Inter-
national Association of Pet Cemeteries,
estimates that most of the 4-00 to 500
pet cemeteries in the United States are
located in the East, primarily the
Northeast. But the few that we have
here in California seem to, well, make
a statement. Take the Bubbling Well
Pet Memorial Park in Napa, for in-
stance (so lovingly illuminated in the
documentary ﬁlm Gates of Heaven):
With nearly ﬁve acres on three levels
just for pets on a 35-acre park, it’s one
of the largest in the country and, really,
the name says it all. Or take the Los
Angeles SPCA Pet Memorial Park in
Calabasas, established in the 19208:
how many pet cemeteries can boast of
having not one but two of Tonto’s
horses buried therein? And Pet Haven,
the sacred resting place of Edward G.
Robinson’s, Jerry Lewis’s, and Tina
Turner’s dogs: it played the pet ceme-
tery in the greatest movie ever made
about cemeteries, The Loved One.

It was superb casting, as a brochure
detailing Pet Haven’s “call service”
makes clear: “A kind, considerate and
understanding representative will be
there to assist in all ﬁnal arrangements.

Your pet will be kept Under controlled
refrigeration before burial and will be
groomed for repose, and viewing in
our slumber room.”

The loss of a pet—especially a dog—
is for most people a traumatic affair,

which is why pet-loss counseling
groups are popping up around the
state. For some it is devastating, and
they search for a way to lessen their
loss. A grave in a pet cemetery is not
always enough for these people, which
is why Gardena taxidermist Harvey
Brown says, “We could make a living
mounting dogs.” But no Los Angeles—
area taxidermist, including Brown, will
work with pets anymore. Some cite the
inevitable disappointment of the
owners when they pick up their dog
some six months later. Others, like
Tom Dejon of Dejon’s Taxidermy
Studio, say they won’t do it for per-
sonal reasons. “It appalls me when
people call]: says Dejon. “It’s a spur of
the moment thing—they don’t want to
lose it, they want to hang on.” Most
agree-that dealing with highly emo-
tional, irrational people is the major
drawback.

Traditional taxidermists like Dejon
consider themselves craftsmen; they
spend years learning how to skin the
animal, carve a properly sized model,
and then stretch the skin over the form.
and put it together—nicely. But with
the recent availability to commercial

'operation.

 

taxidermists of a freeze-drying process
developed by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, preserving an animal is much
easier and generally preferable to the
pet owner. It still takes up to nine
months, at a cost of $400 to $500 or
more, but the animal is merely gutted
and packed—everything else besides
the eyes remains intact. Including, most
importantly, the face. “It’s a dynamite
process,” says one Southern California
taxidermist who has the freeze-drying
equipment but who stopped using it on
pets the ﬁrst of the year. “The animals
look terriﬁc but when the people come
to pick them up six to eight months
later they get so emotional. It’s not
worth our time.”

But to Rod Shelton, president of
Shelton Freeze Dry Taxidermy in the
Sacramento area, it is worth his time.
Shelton freeze-dries 30 to 40 dogs and
eats a year, and so far he has had only
one really emotional customer, he says.
“Maybe it’s the difference in location
[between Sacramento and L.A.]. Most
of the peOple that have their pets done
here are doing it just with the attitude
of, ‘Well, you know, we just want him
around because he was a neat old guy.
He was always lying around the house
so we might as well have him lying
around the house a little longer.’ ”

That’s certainly not the attitude of
Karen Nastasuk, who was featured in a
recent Los Angeles Times article on
freeze-drying. In fact, Nastasuk admits
to the Times that the death of Tasha,
her beloved pekingese, was harder for
her than that of her father. Which
probably doesn’t sit too well with her
mother. But then neither does the fact
that, two years after his death, Tasha
rests happily atop her daughter’s red-
wood burl coffee table, freeze-dried in
time with his tongue sticking out a bit
just like it always did when he slept. In
fact, Nastasuk’s mother hasn’t set foot
in her house since Tasha went to sleep
permanently atop the coffee table. Nor
does his omnipresence particularly
please Nastasuk’s friends. But she con-
tinues to care for the dog that accom-
panied her through thick and thin and
two marriages, dusting and grooming
him daily with brush and blow-drier
and hair spray.

Nastasuk is the exception rather
than the rule, according to Shelton.
But Northstar Freeze Dry, the Min-
nesota manufacturer of Shelton’s
$50,000 equipment, thinks she may be
just one of many such exceptions—at
least in Hollywood. Shelton says that
he received a call from Northstar after
the Times article came out and was
asked if he’d be interested in becoming
a partner in a freeze-dry franchise
The Northstar owner
thought they might make some inroads
in Hollywood, where they could pay

 

C7"

veterinarians a percentage for refer-
rals. Believing that few people—even
in Hollywood—would want their pets
freeze-dried, and also that the turnover
rate (ﬁve months for a poodle, nine
months for a pit bull) would be un-
proﬁtable, Shelton declined. But I don’t
know. A friend of mine turned down
some lunatic named Wally Amos when
he asked her to invest a few thousand
dollars in a chocolate chip cookie store
franchise he was starting up. Ten years
ago, that sounded ridiculous. For me,
the question is not if the owner of
Northstar Freeze Dry will get a phone
call from a potential investor who reads
this article, but how many calls.

Cave eanem (Beware of the dog).
-—Petronius, from Sagaricon

F IN THE future dogs end up in

a freeze-drier, it’s quite possible

that they’ll begin life, more or less,

in a freezer. That is, if Carol
Bardwick and Dr. Priscilla Stockner
have anything to do with it. Nestled in
the rear of a small courtyard of shops in
aﬂuent Paciﬁc Palisades is their small,
one-room business known as the
Canine Cryobank. It’s doubtful that
the surrounding businesses—a coin
and stamp shop, a Chinese hand laun-
dry, a ﬂower dealer, and a video re-
pairman among them—know just what
it is that Bardwick and Stockner do
when their door is closed. Or open, for
that matter. No doubt most people
would be surprised to learn that these
two squeaky clean-looking women are
in the business of freezing and storing
dog semen.

On a sunny, breezy autumn mom-
ing, I found Stockner, a veterinarian
who doubles as the reproduction and
fertility expert at the West Los Angeles
Veterinary Medical Group hospital,
working with an old and ailing cham-
pion leonberger from Santa Barbara
named Brigadier Brandon. One of only
64 of the rare breed -a mixture of saint
bernard, newfoundl'and, and pyrenean
sheephound—in the United States,
Brandon is dying from heart disease.
His owner, a young woman who in the
past has had to travel to Europe to ac-
quire the dogs, wants to freeze a sample
of Brandon’s semen so that she can in-
seminate a female with it at some point
in the future. In theory, she could wait
as long as 20 to 30 years.

For theowner, coming to the cryo-
bank is both a practical and emotional
matter: it provides an opportunity to
keep the championship bloodline going
as well as to someday have the offspring
of a dog she loves. For Brandon, it’s,
well, it’s just emotional. As it happens,
another client arrives with her mini
wire-haired dachshund, which is in

(continued on page 160)

 

 




 

 

 

heat. Um, suffice to say that the
presence of the dachshund stimulates
Brandon, and Dr. Stockner manually
ejaculates him into a rubber-ended
tube. It took a little work on the part of
both—and believe you me it is not a
pretty sight—but the end result is that
everyone is happy. (To that end,
Stockner tells me with a chuckle that
women tend to get very excited if their
dog proves to have a high sperm
count.)

Stockner examines the semen under
a microscope, checking both the sperm
cell count and motility (prOper swim-
ming speed and direction). Brandon’s
is a small but potent enough sample of
approximately 800 million sperm cells
and is enough to inseminate one bitch,
given that some cells will die in the
thawing process. The sample will be
stored in liquid nitrogen (minus 196
degrees centigrade) until Brandon’s
owner has found the right dog. The en-
tire procedure costs her $260.

I guess you could say that the future
has come. Birth control, genetic
screening, quality of lie—all for a
beast who, as Lord Macaulay said, “is
always spoiling conversation.” I don’t
know, it’s all a bit Orwellian to me. I
mean, I know that dire wolves didn’t
allow the sick or inﬁrm members of
their pack to mate, but look where they
wound up—in the La Brea tar pits. I
think I prefer the futures espoused by
Alexandra Schuttais and Elaine Irving
(i.e., Waugh over Orwell). Schuttais
dreams of building a holistic center for
animals in a large San Fernando Valley
park where all abused and abandoned
animals could come to be cared for by
abused and abandoned children who,
in turn, would. be looked iter by senior
citizens who, in turn, would be over-
seen by a professional staff . of
veterinarians and such. Happy Rain-
bow Park, as it would be called, would
be operated under the auspices-of a
nondenominational religious organiza—
tion called the White Cross Society,
whose members would openly declare
that animals have souls.

For her part, Irving also dreams of
building a refuge home, only this one
would be called Petville Park USA. “‘We
will expand our efforts until ‘The Age
of the Animal’ is a reality,” she writes in
an information packet. “We will build a
refuge home with an adjoining enter-
tainment and educational center that
will pay for the upkeep of the refuge
home, thus making the animals ﬁnan-
cially independent by ‘owning’ their
own business. This ﬁnancial in-
dependence will be a giant step towards
making our domestic pets respected
members of our society.” -

Helpless Animals Are Being
Tortured in Cruel lab Tests

— And It Must Be Stopped!

Thousands of helplessanimals are trapped in a liv-
ing hell — needlessly tortured in research labs across
the country, declares Rep. Robert K. Dornan, who has

 

investigated the terrible abuse. ,
In a nightmare of inhuman cruelty, the poor creatures are
left to die agonizingly with open. infected surgical wounds . . . are

fed rotten food . . . and are crammed into tin
ceiling, revealed Dornan.

And in some cases the pitiful victims
are former pets, stolen from their happy, '

love~filled homes.

The story of their suffering is heart- , .
breaking . . . but it must be told before the
torture can be stopped, said Doman. And ..
ENQUIRER readers can help bring an end
to it by voicing their outrage on the coupon

Animal research is one of the hall-
marks of modern medical science — count-
less breakthroughs have come with labora-
tory help from our four-legged friends. But i
in too many cases, researchers treat lab ani- ~'

mals with neglect and cruelty beyond belief.
Countless gut-wrenching cases have
been investigated by Rep.

Many labs operate what
amount to animal concentra-
tion camps. Dogs and cats
are placed in cages too tiny
for them to turn around in
. . . animals are given rotten
wood to eat dog and cat
cages are stacked ceiling
high and waste from the
upper cages runs down onto
the animals underneath.

Shockingly, petnapping is
an all-too-common method of
providing animals for re-
searchers. At one world-re-
nowned midwest research fa-
cility, local pet owners -—
working on a tip — recov-
ered more than 15 stolen
dogs in a single week.

“Thousands of animals are
tortured in the name of re-
search each year at small
private research labs and

centers all across the coun-
try,” declared Doman.

“These barbaric atrocities
are a national scandal. And
incredibly, many are actu-
ally financed by the taxes of
the American people.

“It’s an outrage — a na-
tional disgrace that must be
brought to a halt."

Dornan’s bill, which will
be considered by the House
of Representatives soon, sets
down these requirements:

0 Researchers must pro-
vide maimed animals with
proper care both before and
after experiments. “

ODrugs to relieve pain
must be used. , .

O Mercy killing must not
be unnecessarily withheld
from suffering animals.

0 Proper food, water and
sanitation must be provided
for all lab animals.

The law also sets strict,
humane guidelines for busi-
nesses that store, transport
and sell animals for labora-
tory use and imposes‘fines
and penalties for violators.

Similar legislation is also
being proposed in the US.
Senate.

Said Dornan, “Violators
would be stripped of federal
funding of any kind. This
legislation will at least deny

THE TAMPA TRIBUNE - November 17, 1985

Animal Tests
Are Unreliab|e
And Obsolete

This is regarding the Nov. 5 editorial,
“Wise Animal Research.” \

The editorial states, “their arguments
that medical research can be conducted
without animals, by using computers or
other methods, should not be taken seriously
by anyone concerned with the welfare of the
human species.”

It is a fact that results of tests on one spe-
cies cannot be accurately applied to other
species.

Because researchers waited for results
of animal tests, 20 million children’s sleep-
ing garments treated with tris, a fire-retard-
ant, remained on the market almost two
years after modern non-animal testing iden-
tified tris as a cancer causing agent.

Fifteen thousand children were born
with severe deformities because Thalido-
mide, a sedative prescribed for pregnant
women, was found safe after extensive ani-
mal testing. Non-animal tests showed Thali-
domide to be dangerous to the development
of the fetus.

E-Feral and Diethylstilbestrol caused
serious side effects in humans, the swine flu
vaccine was extensively tested on animals
and caused human deaths.

Last year, only 4 percent of our national
health budget went to disease prevention,
however, American taxpayers spent $4 bil-
lion on government-funded animal torment.
The reason? It is a big business. We are pay-
ing top salaries and college grants.

There are alternatives. Computer
models, precise tissue, cell cultures, simu-
lated tissues, body fluids, mass spectometry,
gas chromatography, are some of the meth-
ods that can be used instead of testing ani-
mals, and these methods are far more exact.

Animal experiments are unreliable and

obsolete. A dog, cat, monkey, guinea pig,
have vastly different physiologies from each
other — and all of them are different from
humans. Test results based upon their reac-
tions are very misleading.

Tampa Pet Seekers Put Through
Tough Time at Humane Society

I read the letter concerning difficulties
adopting a pet at the Humane Society of
Tampa Bay, Inc. I was both glad and dis-
‘turbed at reading this. Glad, because I en-
countered the same problem attempting to
adopt a dog. Disturbed, because it seems
these problems are happening more fre-
quently with this particular humane society.

The problems I encountered were simi-
lar. I was told my husband had to be present
at the time of adoption or the adoption
would not be granted.

I had made four trips to the humane
society in high hopes of returning home with
a puppy. I was turned down four times, re-
turning home each time more and more
upset.

My husband’s hours at his job did not
allow him to be present at the time of adop-
tion but I told the adoption counselor he
could be reached by telephone for consent.
The“adoption committee” would not waive
the requirement that all family members be
present at the time of adoption.

Because of this and their ridiculous rea-
soning that my son was an overactive child
and would bring serious injury to the animal
once it was brought home, I was denied a

dog each and every time i returned. If this
was the case, I feel they should have taken
me through and picked out the dog they felt
would best fit our family.

I agree strongly with the person who -
wrote the letter to the Tribune. Has this
agency become such a large corporation
that it has lost sight of its goals? Something
needs desperately to be done regarding the
rules and regulations of this humane society.
Many dog and cats are put to sleep due to
its ludicrous ways.

I might mention that I finally was able to
adopt a nine-week-old puppy from the Largo
Humane Society within 20 minutes of filling
out an application. I did not have togo
through all the degrading procedures I had
to go through at the Tampa branch.

I wanted to adopt a puppy bad enough
that if I couldn’t get one from the Humane
Society of Tampa Bay, Inc.,* I’d drive 35
miles from Thonotosassa to Largo to get a
puppy. I am happy to know there are people
at the Largo Humane Society who really
care about giving homes to the homeless
dogs and cats.

THE SUNDAY TIMES — London, England - Nov. 17, 1985

 

Poiso

VETS are ﬁghting to save the lives of
two racing thoroughbreds in Italy after
pesticide was deliberately poured into
the food at the Barbaricina training
centre, near Pisa. The poison has
already caused the agonising death of
26 horses — one of them belonging to
' the British owner Robert Sangster -
since August.

All the horses died of severe internal
lesions. The exact nature of the poison
is not known, but a phosphate
compound is suspected. .

The Italian police and the racehorse
owners are bafﬂed by the crimes, but
theories abound. It has been suggested
that the horses were poisoned by
Maﬁa-dominated gangs of race-ﬁxers
or building speculators who wanted
the land.

The training centre of Barbaricina
set in sand dunes and pine forests
between Pisa and the sea, has been
famous as a centre of horse breeding
since the Middle Ages. There has long
been an intimate connection between
the centre and the British racing world.
Many English-owned horses are
trained there. Sir Ivor, the winner of
the 1967 Derby, spent long periods
there.

 

by Dalbert Hallenstein
Pisa

 

Police are convinced that the killer
works, or has worked, at the training
centre where more than 20 Britons are
employed as stable lads, jockeys or
trainers. Last week the police were
ruling out the hypothesis that the killer
was commissioned by a Maﬁa gang
intent on punishing trainers or owners
who refuse to collaborate in race-11x-
mg.

The worst-hit in the latest poisoning
is Ettore Pistoletti, 43, a brilliantly
successful trainer and owner who lost
15 of the 16 horses poisoned this
month. So far this year his horses have
won 1 12 races in Italy. He says he has
never received requests to ﬁx races or
threats from the racing underworld.

Many people. including the police,
believe that Pistoletti’s success has
created enemies, one of whom could
be the killer. “Though many of my
best horses have been killed,” he says.
“this thing is not going to defeat or
frighten me.”

terror at stables

But the theory that the killings are
the result of one embittered man’s
desire to ruin Pistoletti, though
convenient to the management of the
training centre which can claim that
the other owners are relatively safe,
does not square with the facts.
Pistoletti it not the only victim. There
have been four separate incidents of
poisoning involving horses belonging
to three other owners.

Marion Andolfi. whose husband
Paolo has lost two horses. is convinced
that the target of the poisoning is the
company that runs the training centre.
“Friends have suggested that it could
be an attempt by building speculators
to ruin the company so that pressure
can be put on local politicians to open
up the area for housing". she said.
“Meanwhile security at the stables is as
lax as it has always been.“

Colleen Barry, 30, a British
member of the stable’s staff, is

terrified. “The killer must be someone
we all know, perhaps a friend. Nobody
would dare come in here if he wasn’t
known to us. Besides, he must have
known exactly when we cook the
weekly mash for the horses. At night
I’m very frightened.”

Our zoo is a wonderful and educational place. Part of that .

education is the fact that there are meat-eating animals on this
earth—man included.

Now, because of Mary Ann Barbie and Tax a ers A ainst
Animal Brutality (TAAB), children will be missiﬁgya impgrtant
part of their learning experience. 2

Shall we close the zoo? After all, the carnivores must eat. God
created them needing meat. Shall we ban all nature Shows on
telemion? They show the ways of life and death.

As Barbic and other members of TAAB sit down to their
vegetarian meals (I’m sure they would never eat any beef, lamb,
veal or pork—a farmer’s child probably petted or played with it)
I hope they seriously consider what a vital part of life’s education
they are denying the children of our city.

Zoo’s farm is rosy;
providing food isn’t

The Dec. 8 editorial “Leo, eat your tofu” bemoans the fact the
Cleveland Metroparks zoo may have to close its petting zoo
because it may no longer feed the animals to the 200’s carni-
vores when the season is over. The editorial said that the kids
came up with nothing while the Pollyanna-goody-two-shoes
whose view prevailed “went off to clap for Tinkerbelle.” I guess
The Plain Dealer was saying that these Pollyannas are naive and
unrealistic. Perhaps they are, but may we examine the folly the
petting zoo perpetuates?

The petting zoo looks like a storybook farm, the kind we had

. colorful books about as children. The animals are happy, the barn
is red and the sky is blue. It is the image most urban adults have
if they ever wonder where their meat comes from. We all know
the animals we eat first roamed free and contented on scenic
country farms. Nonsense! Millions of chicken nuggets and bacon
burgers can’t be served each day if the animals have to be chased
around acres of land. '

Maybe it is time all Americans become aware that the vast
majority of the animals they eat where confined in factory farms.
Chickens are stuffed into cages that may restrict them from
standing, let alone spreading their wings. Their beaks are
clipped so they won’t peck each other to death under the stress of
overcrowding. The veal you eat usually comes from a calf who
spent most of its life in a stall so small it could not turn around or
stretch its legs and was intentionally kept anemic so its flesh
would be tender enough to satisfy you. Beef cattle, notorious for
being pumped up with antibiotics in dosages that may harmfully
be transmitted to humans, are allowed to graze in their early
months. Later they are transported to feed yards, where their
movement is greatly restricted until it is time for slaughter.

The petting farm helps us pretend the factory farm does not
exist, so who is being the Pollyanna? I don’t think Leo should eat

tofu, but perhaps we could try to get along with fewer dead
animals on our plates.

Black- footed ferret preserved
on footage for TV before dying

By The Associated Press

MEETEETSE, Wyo. —— A
female ferret nicknamed “Fannie”
is one of the stars of an upcoming
TV program about Meeteetse’s col-
ony of rare black-footed ferrets.
Unfortunately, her first role was
her last.

The ferret died Monday of can-

ine distemper, a deadly and highly _

contagious disease that’s threaten-
ing North America’s only known
colony of black-footed ferrets.

Ray Paunovich, of Natural lim—

age Films which is producing the”

TV documentary, says much of his
best footage resulted from a
unique relationship he developed
with the ferret and her young.
About 15 hours of footage will be

edited into a one-hour program to '

be broadcast next spring on the
Turner Broadcasting System’s
WTBS Superstation. Later it will
be broadcast on public television
stations across the country. .
The program on the ferret col-
ony is one of four episodes in the
National Audubon Society’s “World
of Audubon” series. TBS contribut-
ed $2.5 million to film the series.
Since 1984, Paunovich has been

filming the colony, and through
last July and August Paunovich
spent up to 20 hours a day behind
the camera on a constant lookout
for the masked carnivores.
Paunovich says the film covers
the colony’s discovery in 1981 and
ongoing efforts to save the ferrets
from extinction. It also illustrates
ferrets’ behavior and describes
their environment — a semiarid,
wind-swept prairie near the
Washakie Wilderness. ,
“The fact that the female ac-
cepted my presence made this a
lot better film,” Paunovich said.
He said he believes Fannie had
previous contact with human re-
searchers and became accustomed

.tohim. .

“Ferrets are appealing to a
much wider audience than many
animals. They’re cute and cuddly,
which is unusual for a predator,”
PaunoviCh said.

Paunovich said he thinks the
lights he used for night filming
may have been a source of securi-
ty for Fannie, since they scared off
hawks and other predators.

“As long as the lights were on
and the noise from the camera was

going, she was OK. But she be-
haved totally different when some-
body else was with me,” Pauno-
vich said.

Ferrets are mostly nocturnal,
but with Paunovich and the cam-
era standing nearby, Fannie began
to venture outside during daylight,
he said.

Paunovich filmed Fannie mov-
ing her litter from den to den and
digging around a prairie dog bur-

row, exhibiting a distinct type of

ferret behavior called“‘trenching.”

Most memorable was a game of
“ferret tag,” in which the young
frolicked among the prairie dog
holes for more than an hour.

Fannie was one of six ferrets
trapped between Sept. 13 and Oct.
11 for use as breeding stock in'a
captive-breeding program.

She was the second of the six to
die. A third ferret has come down
with the disease and a fourth has
shown symptoms, Wyoming Game
and Fish Department officials said.

Paunovich is saddened by the
possibility that his footage maybe
the last taken of a dying species. “I
just hope the colony can survive
this.”

Dogs surround a pig during a recent hunt sta

woods.

United Press International

Wild pigs imperil redwoods

By United Press international

MUIR BEACH, Calif. -- The
wild swine breeding in the rolling
hills of mellow Marin County
have gone too far. They’re threat-
ening the most popular groves of
ancient Redwood trees in Califor-
ma.

Some 1.3 million people annual-
ly trek through Muir Woods Na-
tional Monument, where Red-
woods thousands of years old
reach high into the sky only 15
minutes from San Francisco’s
Golden Gate Bridge.

The National Park Service
finds itself in dire need of funds to
prevent an invasion in Muir
Woods of wild feral pigs that have
already torn up creek beds and
other property in nearby areas of
the nation’s largest greenbelt, the

Golden Gate National Recreation
Area.

Rangers say the first pigs were
spotted in the parklands in 1981.
Once the ordinary domestic pig
variety, they either escaped from
nearby farms or were released
purposely by sportsmen and
thrived in the mild climate.

Glenn Fuller,
manager for Muir Woods, said
signs of the pigs have been seen
in the pOpular Bohemian Grove
stand of Redwoods in the heart of
the monument and along road-
ways and hiking trails outside the
520acre park.

The giant Redwoods, resistant
to diseases and insects, are vul-
nerable because the pigs grub
around the roots of the trees, de-

stroy ferns and ground cover and

park service

till the creekbed, a major source
of nutrients and water.

“It’s a very real danger and as
the pressure is increased on the
woods, the problem will become .
very dramatic,” said Fuller.

Population estimates range up
to 200 or more over a 50-square
mile area and with the fecundity
of the females, the population can
double every four months.

Although Redwood groves are
older and taller in Yosemite Na-
tional Park and at the Redwoods
National Park near the Oregon
border, the 10-mile valley floor of
Muir Woods is where visitors to
San Francisco can gasp at the gi-
ants without traveling long dis-
tances.

The Park Service has request-
ed $160,000 to fence off the valley
ﬂoor section of Muir Woods.

 

 

 

 




SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - NOV. 15, 1985

Runaway ﬂiimp
ﬁlilé‘ Wee After a Week

By George Snyder

A Healdsburg veterinarian
and a posse of friends and
neighbors spent a cold and
fruitless day yesterday looking
for a runaway chimpanzee that
has been making monkeys out
of the humans trying to catch
‘him.

Dr. Glenn Benjamin has been
trying to catch the 12-year-old
,Chimp, named Chipper, since last
Friday when the circus-trained ani-
mal picked a lock on his cage and
escaped into the woods with a fe«
male companion.

The veterinarian, who likes to
keep exotic animals on his ranch,
caught the female chimp the night
of her escape, but Chipper has re-
mained on the loose.

The elusive chimp was sighted
earlier this week by a man tending
cattle in the Alexander Valley area.
The cowboy offered the wayward
animal a beer, which it accepted
before running off again.

“We’re trying to lure him back
.with fruit and hoping at- some point

 

it will want to return to its cage,”
Benjamin said. “Unfortunately, be-
tween our ranch and Geysers to the

east there is about 19 miles oflwoodj

land the chimp can hole up in.”

Earlier this week, Benjamin
camped out in the hopes that the
animal would get tired of the frosty
nights and seek out his companion-
ship.

“That didn’t work,” he said, “so
now we’re just going to hope he gets
homesick. We’re trying to keep it
calm and quiet around here so that
he will come back. Otherwise, he
might just go farther away.”

Benjamin, who also runs a San
Francisco clinic for exotic animals,
says he believes the chimp is mak-
ing a giant circle in the woods,
bringing him back to the same area
each day.

A former circus animal, Chip-
per is a clever animal, according to
the doctor.

“We‘re just heping we can
come up with some tricks of our
own,” he said.

Momana
to release

bear study

By The Associated Press

BOZEMAN, Mont. - A “worst-
case analysis” and computer mod-
eling are among changes in the

state’s draft environmental impact .

statement on grizzly bear manage-
ment to be released this week, a
biologist says.

But Arnold Dood, the Montana
Department of Fish, Wildlife and
Parks biologist who is in charge of
the impact statement, says a
“worst-case analysis” will show

“all of the bad things can’t be hap- T

pening at the same time.” .

If the lowest grizzly population
estimate in the Northern Continen-
tal Divide Ecosystem is combined
with the highest mortality esti
mate, a computer model shows
“we would have zero bears within
four to five years,” he said.

Dood‘said critics of the depart-
ment’s study wanted “worst-case”
scenarios, even though state and
federal research suggests that
grizzly bears are stable or even in-
creasing in number in northern
Montana.

12 meetings held .

The department released its pre-
liminary draft this summer and
then held 12 meetings around the
state to gather public comments.
Another opportunity for public
comment will be presented in mid-
December, and the final study
should be released by late January.

 

Another change in the draft is
the use of a computer model to
evaluate the possible effects of
grizzly bear management.

Many comments questioned the
accuracy of population estimates
used when setting quotas for the
number of grizzly bears that can
be killed each year.

Early study ‘flawed’

For instance, University of Mon-
tana zoology professor Lee
Metzgar said the preliminary
draft’s population density esti-
mates were “fatally flawed.” He .
estimated that as few as 209 grizzly
bears might occur in the area
where hunting is allowed, rather
thanthe 387minimumusedinthe
preliminary draft. .

Dood said the grizzly studies
used in the population estimates
didn’t randomly sample areas for
grizzly bears. He said it would be
diffith to calculate statistical con-
fidence limits, but he is confident
the. numbers are accurate.

He said he would like to see the
focus on grizzly management shift
from the Northern Continental Di-
vide Ecosystem, which includes
Glacier National Park, the Bob
Marshall Wilderness, the Mission
Mountains and adjacent lands, to
areas where the bear is in greater V
danger.

“We . can argue about numbers,
but certainly the bears in the
Northern Continental Divide
Ecosystem are at a higher number
than anywhere else,” he said.

The Northern Continental Divide
is the only area in the lower 48
states where grizzly bears can be

hunted.

 

Environmental organizations
were critical of several aspects of
the preliminary draft, including the
lack of a “worst case analysis.”

 

 




THE DENVER POST - NOV. 13, 1985

What future for black bears?

a BOUT 700 BLACK bears are killed each year

in Colorado during spring and fall hunting sea-

sons. Most of these are shot by hunters who
attract them with baits, ranging from meat scraps to
riieap candy. Most die in May and June. While it’s
unlawful to shoot females with cubs, this happens ac-

cidentally. As a result of the spring hunt, about 30 -

young cubs a year are left to starve in the woods.

In short, the black bear suffers too much mortality
in most areas 0f Colorado, according to a special task
force established by the Colorado Wildlife Commis
sion. Bear populations in at least 12 of Colorado’s 18
black bear areas appear to

troubling is the fact that mor han 40 percent of the

bears reported dead are females. This indicates that '

a good portion of the male population, which roams
i/arther and is more visible, is already gone. And a
state-supported field study at Black Mesa, near
Crawford, shows high mortality for blackbears, even
without legal hunting. _

These telltale signs are disturbing because bears,
having a naturally low rate of reproduction, lack the
ability to readily recover once their numbers are de-
pleted. Overhunting of bear has forced a closed sea-
son in other states, most recently in Wisconsin

The task force says the best way to help the black
bear in Colorado is to limit the total number of 11-
censes sold to hunt them. So why not reduce the num-
ber of bears killed by say a third and, at the same
time, expand research to ensure that we have the
knowledge to properly manage this species?

Colorado’s Division of Wildlife, the agency respon-
sible for wildlife management, prefers instead to
gamble with these animals — and largely in igno-
rance. At a recent public hearing in Fort Collins, it
proposed an unlimited fall hunt and a limited spring
season for most black-bear areas in 1986-88. Field re-
search on the black bear would end mxt year.

The division argues that, if the number of bears
killed in the fall is high, the number of bear licenses
for the spring season can be decreased accordingly in
the 12 problem areas. But hunting pessure may

POVILITIS

merely shift to non-problem areas or to the fall sea-
son. No one knows. AbOve all, politics may not allow
any significant reduction in the bear harvea when
the time comes to set spring license quotas.

Indeed, politics — and not sound wildlife manage
ment —— would seem to be calling the shots for Colora-
do’s black-bear program. The spring bear hunt would
likely end if it were up to most hunters and'the gener-
al public. Why kill weakened bears fresh out of hiber«
nation? Why risk killing female bears with young
cubs that can’t survive on their own? Who eats spring
black bears anyway, though the law says all edible
portions of the carcass shall be properly prepared for
human consumption? And how much “sport” is there
to baiting a hungry bear to its death, a practice com-
mon in spring? Only nine of 29 states that allow bear
hunting have spring seasons. In Colorado, some re-
gional and field staff of the division have openly ex—
pressed a desire to end spring black-bear hunting.

What’s behind the spring hunt, and the overly gen-
erous taking of bears overall? The answer, in part,
may be policy inertia. Or it may be, as some suggest,

‘ the influence of certain outfitters and guides, ".who

offer hunts at $1,500 to $2,500. Such factors shouldn’t
be allowed to jeopardize the well-being of Colorado’s
black bears, which belong to all in this state.

Citizens concerned about black bears should con-
tact the Colorado Wildlife Commission. The commis-
sion will meet Thursday to decide on the Division. of
Wildlife’ 3 proposal, and the future course of black
bear management in Colorado.

THE NEW YORK TIM-ES - November 19, 1985
Will There Be
Enough Chimps
ForResearch? ~ '

$17 million, four-year National Chimpanzee Manage-
ment Plan, under which for the first time many animals
would spend their lives dedicated solely to breeding.
Under. the plan, the Federal Government would help
five to eight different institutes establish populations
totaling 350 animals, from which about 30 to 35 young
chimpanzees could be culled for research uses each
year. Medical researchers currently require about 60
new‘ chimpanzees annually and especially value
younger animals, not yet large and dangerous to handle.

“This is a minimal program,”

 

Chimpanzees in the proposed new __

Plans drawn to pamper animals I

in novel breeding approach.

 

By ERIK ECKHOLM

 

1TH the nation’s future supply of research
chimpanzees in jeopardy, Federal authori-

ties plan to create a special population of '

350 pampered animals that would be ex-
empted from medical duties and enjoy emotionally rich
upbringings designed to enhance their reproductive
skills. ‘

Medical scientists consider chimpanzees, the clos-
est relative to humans in the animal world, to be indis-
pensable for certain experiments, including future tests
of vaccines against AIDS. The projected decline in re-
search animals has engendered wide concern.

Since the mid-1970’s, no imports have been permit-
ted of chimpanzees caught in the wilds of Africa, where
the species is threatened. Hundreds of the animals have
been bred in captivity. But without new measures,
scientists say, the future availability of chimpanzees
will be endangered by two trends.

First, as the chimpanzees born here in captivity

reach maturity, most are
proving inept at mating
and childrearing. Special-
ists believe this is because
the animals were psycho.
logically wounded in in-
fancy by social depriva-
tion, especially early re-
moval from their moth-
ers. Nearly half the 1,200
chimpanzees held for sci-
ence are now captive-born
and that proportion is
steadily climbing.

Second, many of the
animals are used in ex-
periments with a form of
viral hepatitis, non-A non-

B, that can leave them and
.their offspring perma-
nently infectious. Since no
test exists to determine
which of the exposed ani.
mals continue to carry the
virus, these “compro-
mised” animals cannot be
used for many other kinds
of medical research.

“With current prac-
tices, production of ex-.
perimentally uncompro-
mised offspring, behavior—
ally capable of rearing
their offspring, will fall to
zero within approximately

Int]. Species Inventory System 20 years,” a Federal panel
_ ' has warned.

Already, many pri-
mate facilities have begun leaving infant chimpanzees
with their mothers longer than before in the hope they
will prove to be better breeders as adults. In January the
National Institutes of Health will propose to Congress a

 

said Dennis Johnsen, an expert on
primate research at the National In-
stitutes of Health. “It won’t meet all

the needs, but it will insure that a,

breeding population is saved for the
future. If we don’t do something,
chimpanzees will disappear from the
scene in the United States.”

The new proposals come at a
time of increased soul-searching
about obligations to an animal that is
highly intelligent and often star-
tlingly humanlike. The lifetime cost
of keeping a chimpanzee can reach a
quarter of a million dollars. The sug-
gestion made by some officials to de-
stroy chimpanzees that, because of
hepatitis infection or other causes,
“cannot earn their keep” has pro-
voked an outcry from many research-
ers as well as from animal welfare
activists.

Although some animal rights
proponents challenge the morality of
using chimpanzees in research at all,
scientists see these animals as the
only alternative to humans for cer-
tain vital experiments. The majority
of chimpanzees are involved in re-
search on hepatitis, including hepati-
tis-B, which infects some 200 million
people worldwide and is a major
cause of liver cancer and cirrhosis,
and the form known as non-A non-B, a
currently indetectable contaminant
of blood transfusions that also causes
cirrhosis. Chimpanzees are the only
animals other than humans that be-
come infected with hepatitis, but it
does not make them. ill; most re-
search involves blood sampling and
liver biopsies that do not harm the
animals.

Dozens of chimpanzees have al-
ready been used in research on ac-
quired immune deficiency syndrome,
and they will be killed for safety. As
with hepatitis, chimpanzees are the
only known animal the AIDS virus
can infect, but they do not develop the

‘ deadly syndrome. Scientists expect

chimpanzees will be essential for
testing possible anti-AIDS vaccines.
Chimpanzees are also seen as
uniquely suited for certain research
on immunological disorders, repro-
duction and behavior.

“Twenty years ago no one could
have predicted that we would need
chimpanzees so badly for hepatitis -
search,” said Dr. Jan Moor-Janka -
ski, director of New York Universi-
ty’s Laboratory for Experimental
Medicine and Surgery in Primates
(LEMSIP). He endorsed the Federal
proposal, saying, “We can’t know
how many chimps we’ll need in the
future, but if we don’t have any we
can’t go back.”

breeding colonies would not be used
in any research that could threaten
their medical integrity or mental
health. Rearing practices intended to
improve their reproductive perform-
ance would be followed.

Generation of Inept Animals

In the past, many primate cen-
ters have taken newborn chimpan-
zees away from their mothers at birth
or soon after so the mothers can
reproduce again more quickly. While
this has yielded more offspring in the
short term, it has also produced a
generation of abnormal, sexually
inept animals, scientists say.

In the wild, young chimpanzees

ing, nursing and raising infants, and
they develop strong bonds with sib-
lings as they play and learn together.
“We now know that without this nor.
mal social development, chimps are
not effective breeders,” said Thomas
Wolﬂe, a veterinarian with the Na-
tional Institutes of Health who has
helped develop the new national strat-
egy.
In part the problem is that the so-
cially deprived animals never learn
how to copulate or care for infants.

. An excited male “will try to mount .

the female, but he won’t know where
to start,” said Dr. Wolﬂe. “And the
inept females will jerk away any-
way.” Females that do give birth
may neglect their infants, refuse to
breastfeed them or throw them vio-
lently.

But the poor breeding perfum-
ance stems more from psychological
damage than from ignorance, many
scientists believe. “What’s missing in
these animals is self-confidence,”
said Dr. James Mahoney, chief of
reproduction at LEMSIP. “And to
gain that confidence they need a
mother’s love.”

Some of the young females “actu-
ally scream at the approach of a
male,” said Dr. Mahoney, while
others try to divert an excited male’s
attention by grooming him furiously
until he forgets what he came for.
Some males seem to lack any desire
to copulate at all.

Higher Fees Expected

Intense research on the biology
and psychology of chimpanzee repro-
duction and on techniques of artificial
insemination, which has shown little
success so far, will also be pursued as
part of the national plan.

Federal officials say they do not
expect to subsidize breeder chimpan-
zees indefinitely. Rather, their goal is
to provide “seed money” for the reno
vation of cages and living facilities,
for initial maintenance of the breed-

reproduction and infant socialization. .

Over time, they say, those who use
animals in research projects, who-
customarily “rent” the animals on a
temporary basis from permanent pri-
mate facilities, should begin paying

much higher fees that reflect the true ,
costs of raising a chimpanzee and T

keeping it for life.

Keeping a chim costs

panzee
about $5,000 a year. Over its 30 to 50,-...

year lifespan, then, an animal’s
maintenance ranges from $150,000 to

Economic questions have come
to the fore as more chimpanzees, now
some 250 of them, have been used in
research on the non-A non-B form of
hepatitis. Following such experi~
ments, the animals and their off-
spring must be sequestered from
“clean” chimpanzees for life. Some
have gone into behavioral experi-

ments and some are now used in__

AIDS research, but many of the com-
promised animals are not wanted by
experimenters.

The quest continues for a test that
can reveal which of the research vet-
erans carry the hepatitis virus. Mean-
while, that very search, which is of
great import for human health, con-
taminates 50 more animals every
year.

The costly lifetime support of.

“comes out of the hide” of the institu-
tions that keep them, said Nate Fles-
ness of the International Species In-

Minn, which is monitoring the na-
tion’s chimpanzee population.

An April 1984 draft of the new na~
tional plan, now disavowed by offi-
cials, called the hepatitis-compro-
mised animals “a major economic
burden” and suggested that primate
centers might consider euthanizing
those for which no research use could
be found. But the notion of killing

colony, are kept here at New
York University’s Laboratory for
'- Experimental Medicine and Sur-
gery in Primates (LEMSIP) near
"Tuxedo, N.Y. Like several other
research centers, this one is
trying to enrich the lives of young
animals in the hope that they will
grow up to be healthier mentally
and better at breeding than exist-
ing captive-born chimpanzees,
many of which are incompetent
at mating and childrearing. In a
recent tour of the facility, Dr.
James Mahoney, director of
reproduction and infant care, ex-
plained the new approach.

months instead of removing them

. (Some facilties remove them im-
mediately after birth.) The early
experience of mother love and so-
cial ties will make for happy,
self-confident adults who are bet-
ter able to mate and rear young,
many experts believe. Here,
after being taken from their
mothers, young chimpanzees
spend at least another six months
in a stimulating nursery, and
they are not used in medical ex-
periments before the age of two.

dangerous — have been rebuilt
with connecting passages that
allow selected animals to inter-
act. “It’s not like being outside,
but it’s infinitely better than be-
fore, with one animal per cage,”
Dr. Mahoney said. Within the
strictures imposed by caging, he
is trying to encourage develop-
ment of small social groups. In
two of the connected cages, for
example, are an adult male and
two adult females, both gently
fondling their babies.

Infants whose mothers cannot
nurture them are raised in a
nursery where they are bottlefed
to the age of two. Each of the
nursery infants has a different
story: This one’s mother had
worked in a circus all her life and
just didn’t know how to care for a
baby; that one’s mother simply
pushed her away. The staff is
trying to provide them with the
next best thing to a mother’s up-
bringing-

The rooms are colorfully deco-
rated, like a children’s play area
- “It affects the attitude of the
people, which in turn benefits the
animals,” Dr. Mahoney observed
-- and numerous large windows
have been installed at cage
height so the young chimpanzees
can constantly see fellow animals
and human activity in the sur-
rounding rooms. The animals are
often allowed to wander and play
outside their cages and they have
a sturdy jungle gym to climb on.

Finding the nursery door open,
three one-year-old males sidle
into the hallway, clinging to each
other for security as they exam-

dence rising, hops against a win-
dow and pounds on it, displaying
the rambunctious spirit of a well-
adjusted chimpanzee. Ross mus-
ters his courage to touch the new-

twitches. Dr. Mahoney looks on
like a proud father. “I think I
have the nicest job here,” he
says. “And also the saddest.”

strong opposition.
“These chimps have served hu-
manity, and the least we owe them is

a decent retirement,” said Shirley ’

'McGreal, director of the Interna.
tional Primate Protection League.

‘Euthanasia Issue Is Dead’

The protests have apparently had
the desired effect. Last March a panel
of Federal research administrators
concluded that while “euthanasia
may be financially advantageous,” it
(‘ﬁi‘ay not be tenable in view of the in-

tense public interest in the fate of
.ventory System in Apple Valley, —— these animals,” and called for study

of alternatives.

“The euthanasia issue is dead,”
said Dr. Wolﬂe.

Officials acknowledge, however,
that their current proposals simply
defer the problem of how to support
contaminated chimpanzees. Some
scientists privately say they fear
that, because of the extreme ﬁnancial
pressures, some centers may design
unnecessary “terminal” experi-

ments with chimpanzees. .

One alternative being explored is; A
the development of island habitats,
either in the United States or abroad,
where contaminated animals can be
maintained in quarantine at a lower
cost than in research centers. Propo
nents note these animals could al-

Also, when a test for non-A non-B
viral infection is developed, many of
the animals may turn out to be
“clean” after all.

In a different approach entirely,
the New York Blood Center has estab
lished a research facility in Liberia,
in west Africa, which uses captured
chimpanzees and hopes to return
many research veterans to the wild.
Scientists say it will be years before
they know whether this will be feasi
ble. In any case, they say, this cannot
solve the American problem because
chimpanzees born and raised in cap

Whistle, an ex-racer, gets acquainted with Simon McTavish and Super.

—AP Laserphofo

Retired hounds find new homes

WAUSAU (AP) — Like a race horse put out to
pasture, Whistle the greyhound enjoys the soft life
these days, thanks to the Wausau area residents who
turned the former racer into a house pet.

“She’s getting used to our family,” said Carrie
McTavish of the 3-year-old female greyhound she
has had since the beginning of September.

Four area families have claimed retired grey-
hounds as pets since learning from Jim Johnson that
the dogs commonly face death or retirement to an
experimental laboratory when their racing days are
over. ' .

Johnson, of Wausau, got his greyhound, Reeves,
from a racing track at Hinsdale, N.H., earlier this
summer. The other families have gotten their dogs
from a Dubuque, Iowa, track, with Johnson’s help.

“When we heard about what happens to them
once they are done racing, we decided that instead
of seeing a dog end like that, we’d try and save one,”
Mrs. McTavish, of Schofield, said.

She said it took two weeks to housebreak Whistle,
who now shares the home with Mrs. McTavish, her
husband, Robert, and their 2-year-old son, Simon.

“1 don’t know- if she misses some of the other
dogs at the track, because sometimes she likes to be
by herself,” Mrs. McTavish said. “But she likes our
beagle. They’re frien .”

Mary Bachman of Wausau said her 2-year-old
greyhound, formerly known as Windspear but now re-
named Mikah, has become a household companion.

“He follows me around all over the house,” she
said. “It’s like having a big 2-year-old baby around.”

There may be fame, but there is little fortune in-

a $50 honorarium -— sometimes a bit more if the
stupid pet people (as they are called) travel a great
distance. Nevertheless, pet owners from all over the
country vie to appear, arriving in New York for try-

Sometimes the line blurs between human tricks and
pet tricks. Take Mary Jane Sorgel, a middle-aged
blonde, who, according to her calling card, was an
original “Golden Girl” for the Green Bay Packers in
the ’50s.

Sorgel recently sent in a tape of herself wearing a
scanty, red-sequined drum-majorette costume and
high-heeled boots. As an off-camera accompanist
strummed a guitar and dolefully sang How Much Is

That Doggie in the Window? Sorgel twirled a baton
while balancing a Yorkie on her head. It was difficult
to tell where the teased hairdo ended and the fluffy
little dog began.

Sorgel, according to Hall, looks like a sure thing.

But the history of “Stupid Pet Tricks” is filled with
tales of heartbreak as well as triumph.

A chicken that played dead dropped dead just be-
fore being booked. After his ferret died, one deter-
mined owner mailed in a tape of himself describing in
great detail what the ferret would have done.

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - NOV. 15, 1985

Slaughter Ofi’Frogs w
Draws Ecologists’ Ire

@1985, Reuters News Service

HONG KONG -— The slaughter of
frogs across Asia to satisfy the palates
of European gourmets has angered
ecologists and has triggered a cam-
paign by the World Wildlife Fund to
end the trade In frogs’ legs. ,

Animal protection societies in West
Germany have joined enthusiastically
in the fund’s Save the Frog campaign.
In Asia, ecologists say, farmers who
cash in on the slaughter are killing
their own best friends.

In Bangladesh, one of the world’s
biggest suppliers of frogs’ legs, the
government has banned the hunting
of frogs during the April-to-July
breeding season becauSe it has recog-
nized the frOgs’ role in the battle
against agricultural pests.

Frogs eat nearly their own body
weight in insects and other crop pests
each day. Theyjalso help control the
insects that carry malaria and
encephalitis.

In China, frogs have traditionally
been a popular source of food. But an
official ban on their sale has been
imposed, and the amphibians are now
regarded as crucial to the control of
pests.

But in Indonesia, President Suharto
has urged farmers to hunt more frogs
as part of a national drive to boost
foreign exchange earnings with non-
oil exports.

Last year, Indonesia exported 2,200
tons of frogs’ legs, worth around $4
million. The Netherlands, France,
Singapore and Belgium were the big-
gest importers.

Even that was was a big decline
from 1983, when Indonesia exported
3,296 tons, worth $8.75 million. Ecolo-

gi'sts say the sharp decline may have
been due to overhunting. .

Throughout Asia, the hunting of
frogs has been criticized by animal
protection agencies because of the
gruesome way they are killed.

Usually their legs are cut off with a
blade while they are still alive. The
rest is tossed aside on a bloody twitch-
ing pile of limbless torsos and gaping
mouths to die.

Sometimes they are skinned alive.

In Hong Kong’s markets, they are
chopped up in front of customers.

India has taken action to change the
methods of killing. "India will not stop
exports of frogs‘ legs. But last J une. we
ordered all licensed exporters to com-
ply with a procedure of more humane
killing of frogs,” a spokesman for the
state-owned Marine Products Export
Development Authority said.

The decision means a cleaner death
for the frogs that abound in the

marshy land and rice fields of south-

ern India.

Under the new directive, the frogs
must be electrically stunned before
the legs are removed. The spokesman
said export licenses were being issued
only to traders who used this method.

Last year, India exported 2,500 tons
of frozen frogs’ legs, mostly to France.
Japan, Belgium, the United States and
Australia. Indian frogs‘ legs are prized
because of their large size: The frogs
often weigh up to 3 pounds each.

But ecologists want the exports
stopped. G.M. Oza, general secretary
of the India Society of Naturalists,
said little demand existed for frogs'
legs within India. Continuing their ex~
port will have serious ecological con-
sequences. he said.

Animal Control

Should Stay
With Control

It is sheer insanity for the Hillsborough
County Animal Control to willingly turn over
the community’s lost pets for live animal ex-
perimentation. 7

One doesn’t have to like animals to un-
derstand that the function of animal control
should be —— animal control. In a recent sur-
vey or 1,700 pounds by the Humane Society
of the United States, 97 percent of the war-
dens concurred that releasing pound pets
for experimentation harmed animal control
because many would not turn in lost pets to
an institution that acted as a front for ani-
mal researchers.

Animal control is a community service.
It eliminates or at least reduces the possibil-
ity of loose animals that can bite children or
cause accidents.

If peOple choose to breed animals for
laboratories, they are free to do so. They are
called dog dealers.

It is no accident that animal researchers
don’t allow the public to ascertain how these
animals are being used. The biomedical
community has published a pamphlet advis-
ing how to deflect questions.

The cost of research will not go up, it
would decrease. Much research will be cur-
tailed if the researchers can’t use the excuse
that the animals are going to be killed any-~
way.

A national group of doctors, the Re-
search Modernization Committee, has just
come out against using pets with unknown
genetic, medical and disease backgrounds.
This was not with concern for the animals
but concern out of the possible harm done
by relying on poor models.

There is no way to guarantee that any-
one’s own animal will not end up in a labora-
tory if one lives in or around Hillsborough
County. One could be out of town for a few
days and unable to retrieve it in time.

Unless people help reverse the current
policy, their lost pets may someday end up
in a laboratory.

From the street, Vernon Yates’ Wild—

looks exactly like what it' used to be: a
small St. Petersburg, Fla. veterinari-
an’s office. Behind the building, how-
ever, a 50-by-70-foot chain link fence
encloses an animal collection to rival
that of any small-town 200. “The origi-
nal intent,” explains Yates, 33, “was to
take care of injured wildlife only. But it
has grown into a center that houses
escaped and exotic pets. If there’s an
animal problem that no one knows
what to do with, lend up with it.”
Recovered animals, snakes or birds
are returned to the wild as soon as

turned up, among others; three mon-
keys, four blind squirrels, three crip-
pled owls, nine raccoons recovering
from distemper, two silvery Arctic fox-
es, a great blue heron and one pea-
cock. lndoors, where Yates lives with
his partner, Debbie Parker, 29, and her
two daughters, there is a floor-to-ceil-
ing collection of snakes in addition to
baby rabbits, opossums, a starling and
six fuzzy quails: in all, more than 225
creatures.

Yates currently services three Flori-
da counties, but says, “We go wherev—
er there’s a need." He answers 30 to 40
telephone calls a day and can rarely
finish a meal without his beeper sound-
ing off. Still, “working seven days a
week, 24 hours a day doesn’t get to
me; people get to me,” says Yates,
launching into a litany of human cruel-
ty: an opossum beaten with a nail-stud-
ded board, three raccoons sprayed
with acid.

Ironically, he adds, “more animals
are killed out of kindness than anything
else.” One man thought a turtle would
be happy in a chlorinated swimming
pool. When the turtle was brought to
Yates, “it was one massive sore.” lgno-
rance can be disastrous. “People will
keep a baby raccoon three or four days,
not knowing what to feed it,” he says.
“When it’s barely breathing they bring it
to me, expecting miracles.”

As a fierce champion of wildlife,
Yates has had his share of run-ins with
the state health department over its

 

 

 

«

routine killing—to test for rabies—of
any wild animal that bites a person.
Once he went to court to help a pet own-
er save his coatimundi by having it
quarantined. Yates’ love of animals
goes back to his boyhood. The son of an
auto mechanic in St. Petersburg, he al-
ways had pets that included “anything
that ran loose.” He quit school at 15 to
work in an auto repair shop and later as
an electrician. By Yates’ let birthday
he had already owned a lion and a leop-
ard and acquired an ocelot. Even
though he sold it to please his wife,
Yates’ first marriage failed.

In the late ’703 Yates did volunteer

: work for Ralph Heath’s Suncoast Sea-

bird Sanctuary—bringing home four-
legged creatures and reptiles. Soon he
was receiving referrals from the area’s
two SPCAs. In 1984, when his second
marriagefoundered and his wife or-
dered Yates and his creatures out of
their house, St. Petersburg Mayor Co-
rinne Freeman arranged a dollar-a-
year lease on the veterinarian’s office.

Yates keeps the operation going on
donations and from the fees he col-
lects for removing nuisance animals
such as opossums and raccoons—$5 a
day for each trap set and $7 for each
animal removed to a wilderness site.
“We collected about $50,000 last year
and spent every penny and then
some,” he says. “There are days l feel
like, ‘To hell with the world,’ ” be ad-
mits. But as the dusk settles in and the
owls rustle their feathers and little fox-
es yip and tumble at play, Yates recon-
siders. “It’s a dirty job,” he admits,
“but it’s worth it when you can see the
animals run back into the wild.”

Yates cuddles a coatimundi, native to Con-
tral America. “Animals aren’t going to hurt
you,” he says. “They just want to survive.”

Rabid bat forces -

school officials
to move children

By Kathy O’Toole
The Tribune .

BERKELEY '— School officials moved 60
children out of Hillside School in the Berkeley
hills yesterday following the discovery of a rabid
bat in the area this week. _

The hat was discovered Monday near the
steps of the school and apparently lived in its
a re.

Denny Constantine, a state veterinarian who
has conducted extensive studies of rabies in bats,
inspected the elementary school on LeRoy Ave-
nue yesterday and found another bat hiding be— .
tween a roof gutter and the school’s outer wall.

 

He also found bat droppings in the attic.
The second bat didn’t appear diseased, but
Constantine said he would observe it for a week.

See BA T, Back Page

Continued from Page A-I

The first hat was examined
by state health laboratory
technicians and found to be
rabid.

After an inspection of the
Hillside school Monday, De-
partment of Health Services
officials had declared it safe
for the children’s return.

But as a precautionary mea-
sure, the students now have
been moved to classrooms at
Oxford Elementary School.

City health officials also
urged parents to question their
children to be sure they had not
played with bats. Residents
were reminded all pets should
be immunized against rabies as
they can easily come in contact
with rabid skunks, squirrels or
raccoons. »

Rabies is a disease that can
be fatal if untreated.

The parent of a Hillside stu-
dent discovered the first bat,

nearly dead, Monday morning,
said Jacquelyn Housh, princi-
pal of Oxford School.

Hillside currently houses two
classes because the children’s
regular classrooms at the.0x-
ford school were declared un-
safe this summer due to dry
rot

Hillside was closed as a full-
tirne public elementary school
in 1983 but since then has
housed a private children’s
day-care center.

The young children in the
center are always supervised
by adults, said director Beverly
Brady, and so are unlikely to
have come in contact with the
bats.

“We’ve questioned all the
(school-age) children. None of
them touched (the rabid bat),”
Housh said. '

To get rabies, the children
would have to have been bitten
by the bat, Constantine said,

which is “very unlikely.” ,
“The only way people get hit-
ten is if they decide to handle
one,” he said. ,
Only about one bat in 1,000 is
rabid in California, he added,
and they are not as threatening .
to humans or pets as other rab— j
id animals because they don’t
get ferocious and attack when ‘
diseased. '
Vampire bats in Latin Amer-
ica and other tr0pical climates
are a serious health problem .
for livestock and humans, be- '
cause they infect their victims

said.
Bats often move into attics
such as that at Hillside through
louvres or screens that aren’t

Stress of Deer Hunting +
May Cause Sudden Death

 

By DR. LAWRENCE POWER

Researchers in Michigan have
been studying the outbreaks of
sudden death that occur among
deer hunters each fall. To evaluate
the effects of hunting on the heart
they persuaded nine deer hunters
with coronary artery disease, aver-
age age 50, to wear monitoring
equipment during their hunts. It
was an undertaking that led to
unexpected findings.

Walking through the woods in
search of deer increased the hunt-
ers’ heart rates by an average of
60% and triggered several episodes
of very fast rates lasting several
minutes.

Sighting a deer was even more
exciting, increasing the heart rate
70%. Missing a shot restored rates
to normal fairly quickly, but hitting
the deer was exciting in the ex-
treme. It triggered several minutes
of the heart rate doubling, as did
dressing the fallen animal and
dragging its carcass to home base.

The researchers concluded that
deer hunting is bilaterally life-
threatening, especially for hunters
not physically fit or who have
coronary artery disease.

More cardiologists are convinced
that exercise slows the natural

progression of coronary artery dis—
ease. Activity as gentle as walking
at a brisk pace for 30 minutes a day
has been shown to be beneficial. It
increases the body’s ability to uti-
lize oxygen and is safer than either
jogging or dancing. Walking ele-
vates the heart rate to increase its
efficiency as a pump and generally
improves the body’s aerobic or
oxygen-burning metabolism.

Once patients with heart disease
get reconditioned, they achieve
what is known as a training effect:
The heart is actually working less
because it is working more effec-
tively.

The pulse rate slows and blood
pressure comes down because the
heart has become capable of pump-
ing a larger volume of blood with
each stroke, requiring less effort. It
is also less susceptible to the accel-
erating effects of excitement or
effort.

Walking is what deer hunters do
when they’re not sitting and wait-
ing. It’s a physical skill that most of
us acquire early in life and should
normally continue into our golden
years. It requires no special equip—
ment, no special environment, no

umpires, teammates, rules or game
plan. And unlike hunting, walking
can be done at any time in all kinds
of weather and without a license.

_ Harry Truman’s brisk early
morning walks helped keep him
bright and agile well into his 80s; it
probably improved and lengthened
the lives of the reporters and
Secret Service men assigned to
keep up with him.

An earlier President, Thomas
Jefferson, wrote that “the sover-
eign invigorator of the body is

 

exercise, and of all exercises walk-
ing is best.” Research has con-
firmed the philosopher’s hunch;
and although deer hunters may or
may not be aware of it, a condition-
ing pre-hunt period of at least six
weeks would be prudent.

To protect his heart from over-
responding to excitement, the
hunter wants a cardiovascular sys-
tem that is toned and tolerant of
demand, plus a slow and efficient
heart that keeps its cool.

For several weeks before his
annual endeavors the hunter ought
to take aim on fitness and squeeze
off a few rounds of exercise. And a
touch of meditation or yoga might
help calm those primal palpitations. ‘

 




 

' Neighbor catches man in act

- In the Sierra North subdi-
vision, Russell Smith has
been shooting neighborhood
dogs with a pellet gun since
June. Mostly, he takes aim at
the critters from inside his
home at 4734 Casa Espana.
He says their barking gets on
. his nerves.

The dog pinkings occur regu-
larly and make homeowners in
Smith’s immediate area, espe~
cially the ones with small chil-
dren, even more nervous than
he is.

“My home is back-toback
with Mr. Smith’s,” says Jennifer
Beadle of 4739 Casa Verde, the
mother of four. “I am scared to
' death half the time that his ran-
dom. pellets might bounce

around and blind some child in
here.”

Claiming her neighbors share
that fear, Beadle says city po-

lice when summoned can do

nothing about the problem. .

“First off, the officer who
comes must see Smith in the act
of shooting before an arrest can
be made. Fat chance of that
ever happening, since Smith
usually pulls the trigger from in-
side his house.

“As to neighbors filing a
charge against the man in Mu-
nicipal Court, that won’t be ac-
cepted unless we spot him in the
act of shooting.”

He surfaces

WELL, ONE day last week

“He aims everywhere, this

street. It’s a steady thing. But
this time I caught him and took
appropriate action,” said Bea-
dle.

mother fumed. “Cruelty to ani-

AT HOME Monday, Russell
Smith summed up his attitude
this way: “I’ve lived here 18
months, and I work at home
during the day. The continuous
barking of nearby dogs is an aw-
ful nuisance. Often as not, I
hear it over my home TV recep-
thIl. Sometimes it goes on till 2
or 3 o’clock in the morning. Five
months ago, I decided to fight
back.”

He said neighbors in many in-
stances keep two or more dogs
in their yards and one home
“has four dogs of the same
breed all yapping at once.”

Smith said the pellets he
shoots have never seriously in-
Jured a dog because he aims “at

one, it is something to think
about, isn’t it?

Tests on animals OK with most Americans

By LAWRENCE KlLMAN

Associated Press

Most Americans accept the need to use animals in mediCal and
scientific experiments, but many are concerned that test animals:
, may be treated inhumanely, according to a Media General-;

Associated Press poll.

Nearly half of the 1,412 people questioned in the nationwide.

; telephone poll believed laboratory animals were treated humane-

ly, but 30 percent did not. Twenty-four percent were unsure. ‘
' The treatment of laboratory animals provoked debate last.

summer when federal funds were suspended for a University of

- Pennsylvania projeCt that inflicted head injuries on baboons.

Some animal-rights activists, appalled by the project, staged a
four-day sit-in at the National Institutes of Health. In addition to
suspending funds, NIH planned to step up inspeCtions of researCh
laboratories to ensure that animals receive proper care.

Animals have contributed to medical advances and basic
Scientific research, sometimes with their lives. They are also used
in allergy testing by Cosmetic Companies and others.

Eight in 10 respondents in the Media General-AP poll said they

believed it was neCessary to use animals in medical researCh on

- diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes.

HOUSTON POST
Nov. 8, 1985

 

Nearly nine in 10 persons polled had
no objection to using rats In medical ;
and scientific experiments. But four in
10 disapproved the use of dogs.

 

Seven in 10 said animal testing was also needed for basic
scientific research, and six in 10 said animals were needed in
allergy testing.

WHICH ANIMALS should be used for medical experiments?
Nearly nine in 10 had no objection to using rats. But when it
comes to dogs, 55 percent approved and 40 percent disapproved
their use in experiments.

Among those who disapproved of using dogs, 60 percent
would change their minds and approve their use if no other
animals were suitable for certain lifesaving medical experiments.

Respondents also were questioned on whether they believed
animals have basic rights and whether those rights were violated
by animal experiments.

Three-quarters said they believed animals had rights, and 46
percent of them said the experiments violated those rights.
Thirty-eight perCent said the experiments did not violate the
rights of animals, and 16 percent were unsure.

The poll also found that animal-rights activists get little
support from the American public when they break into
laboratories and steal animals. Only seven percent of the
respondents said such aetions were justified.

Those who seek to stop animal shelters from releasing
abandoned dogs and cats to research laboratories have only 20‘
percent support among the poll respondents. Seventy-two
percent said researchers should be allowed to experiment with
animals that otherwise would be killed at the local pound.

MEN AND WOMEN had signifiCantly different opinions on
several of the issues. 2

Women were less likely than men to aCcept the necessity of

CONROE -- A Conroe municipal judge
Thursday ordered a pit bulldog destroyed,
saying he is certain the dog is vicious
enough to repeat an Oct. 21 attack in
which the dog ripped open the left side Of a
4-year-old girl’s face.

“I don’t want it on my shoulders if that
dog digs his way out under a fence and
does it again,” said Judge James D.
Jones. who had auestioned the bite victim,

Niki Mayer, in chambers. “I had no doubt
he would.”

The verdict was appealed by Max
Turner, representing the dog’s owners,
Kenneth Gillis and Wanda Stewart of Con-
roe. Jones postponed execution of the sen-
tence for 10 days until an appeal can be
taken to Montgomery County Court.

Gillis and Stewart shook their heads at
the verdict after telling the court the dog,
Princess, never attacked anyone before
the Oct. 21 incident and had not even been

dy and said he was sorry it happened but
contended he would not be concerned
about the injured girl’s safety if she got
around the dog again.

“We weren’t shocked by the ruling, but
obviously we’re disappointed,” Turner
said after the 2%—hour hearing.

The victim’s mother, Amy Moyer,
joined County Attorney Jim Dozier, who
helped prosecute the case, in calling for
additional legislation concerning danger-
ous animals. Dozier has said cages or li-
ability insurance should be considered as
additional controls on vicious animals.

Dozier said he plans to take the case
before a grand jury for possible criminal
charges against the dog’s owners. He
helped prosecute a case in August that
ended in a 5-year sentence for the owner of

Trick gives cranes chance in

By Ron Seely
Regional reporter

At this very moment, somewhere in the sky
above Indiana, there are a couple of young
sandhill cranes that will forever think their
mother was a lumpy sheet.

They are two of seven raised this summer
at the International Crane Foundation in Bara-
boo by humans dressed in sheets with wings at-
tached. It was trickery, perhaps. But it was for
a good cause.‘ Five of the seven birds, including
the two over Indiana, were released in the wild
and got along fine.

Claire Mirande, curator of birds at the foun-
dation, said it is one of the few times on record
that hand-reared birds have been successfully
released in the wild. Research on the hand-
raising techniques is being done by Rob Ho-

' wich, the foundation’s behaviorist. The founda-

tion recently received a $13,500 grant to con-
tinue the work.

Ms. Mirande said the cranes were raised so
that they never saw a human. After they
hatched, they were placed in pens outfitted
with one-way mirrors and models. The models
were of stuffed cranes in the brooding posture,
sitting with wings outstretched. Tape record-
ers played crane noises.

When it came time for feeding, a model
crane’s head with a scissor mechanism for a
bill was stuck through a hole in a wall.

At pen-cleaning time, in came one of the
foundation researchers attired in the crane
outfit. The outfit, described by Ms. Mirande as
“a big gray sack with wings,” is not likely to ap-
pear at the spring fashion shows in Paris next
year. But it certainly went over well with the
baby cranes who looked at the researcher in
the outfit and figured it was just mom lumber-
ing around acting silly.

In August, when the birds were two months
old, they were taken to the wildlife refuge at
Necedah. They were kept in pens there for a
while, too, and again taken care of by workers
in crane costumes.

“They still thought it was mom,” Ms. Mi-
rande said.

Only once, when they entered the pens to do
some health tests, did the workers allow them-
selves to be seen by the birds without the cos-
tumes. But that was done, Ms. Mirande said, so

This outfit may not win any fashion shows, but it’s been used at the Inter-
national Crane Foundation at Baraboo to successfully hand—raise sandhili
cranes. The hoods on both the crane and the researcher, above, are to
keep the crane from seeing humans.

the birds would develop some fear of humans.

When the birds were finally released, they
adapted to the wild much as if they had been
raised by natural parents. They were able to
find natural foods and they appeared to fear
natural enemies like raccoons and dogs.

In the last few days, the hand-raised cranes
- outfitted with solar-powered transmitters -—
have been leaving with wild birds for the
warmer climate of Florida. At least two have
been tracked to the J asper—Pulaski Wildlife
Area in central Wisconsin, a major fall staging
area for migrating cranes. One remains at
Necedah, two already are on the way to Flor-
ida and two are believed to have become vic-
tims of predators.

——Crane Foundation photo

The implications of all this, Ms. Mirande
said, are tremendous. If researchers are able
to perfect the hand-raising techniques for the
sandhill cranes, they will be able to apply them
to more endangered species of cranes, thereby
helping to guarantee the survival of a species
that otherwise may not have much of a chance.

Researchers will continue to track the
cranes on their way to Florida. And they will
be waiting anxiously to see if they mate suc-
cessfully. That, Ms. Mirande said, will be the
biggest test of all.

Meanwhile, the hand-raised cranes continue
winging their way south. Heaven knows what
will happen if they spot a housewife hanging
her sheets on the clothesline.

Honor Thy Faithful, Noble Pig,
For He Has Charm Anal Personality

Animal lovers are legion. Dogs have
been favored pets for thousands of
years. Cats for millennium. Even
mules have been given a day of
appreciation.

Moreover, another maligned species
is said to be making a fine comeback ——-
the pig..Hogs have been around a long
time, perhaps longer than we have, like
for 35 million years. Much of that time
this great animal has been associated
with the sinful habits of mankind,
though it’s obviously unfair to place all
the people-flaws on the uncomplaining

’ swine. Pigs have been slandered since

man appeared on earth.
Consider: Hogwash means filthy
propaganda, and gluttony is a human

_ sin ascribed to hogs though people

invented it. Even ancient religions
made the eating of pork against the
law, an unclean thing. This wasn’t out
of compassion for the animal, either.
Perhaps contempt for this noble beast
began only because refrigeration had
not been invented at the time.

To know a pig is to love one. Many
people have come to respect pigs as
pets and to recognize their better
human qualities. Pigs are loyal, pigs
are affectionate, pigs are smarter than
hell, and pigs are clean, if given a
chance.

Pigs are faithful and protective. Put
a trained one in a fenced yard and
absolutely nobody will venture into
your property to rob you or even
commit a misdemeanor. I encountered
such a watch-hog once in Mat-
tamuskeet, N .C., as I walked alongside

a fence going to a duckblind on the
lakeshore. The hog ran along the fence
roaring, snorting and otherwise ad-
monishing us that a trespass would be
severely punished. Any prudent person
would choose to confront a rabid dog,
rather than a dedicated watchhog.

Of the host of dogs I’ve known, all
had one ambition: to become a fat dog.
Anti-pig propaganda has led millions to
underestimate the charm, dignity and
personality within pigs.

“No man should ever be allowed to
be President who does not understand
hogs,” Harry Truman said. The U.S.A.
would be a safer place if all candidates
had to pass that test.

Pigs are becoming pets, even house
pets, by people who have advanced
beyond dog and cat ownership. Some-
body named William Hedgepeth wrote
in “The Hog Book,” “Ever so'grad-
ually people are coming to take note of
that inchoate and disturbing beaut-
itude, often mixed with distressing
hallucinations of happiness, that flows
over them whenever they happen to
stumble into the presence of a hog
People are realizing, as one newly
awakened young Manhattan executive

put it, ‘You can be yourself with a
hog!”’ '

Pigs have so many unrealized
possibilities. They are easily house-
trained. A 4-week-old pig has been
paper trained in three days. Most dogs
take longer. Pigs have been trained to
swim. One got an award for rescuing a
drowning boy. Why not train them-for
hunting and retrieving game? They’d
be life-savers in field or marsh, for
they eat all the snakes they can find.
They’re immune to snakebite.

An English nobleman used a pig to
point birds in the 19th century, accord-
ing to a fine story by Stephen Hall in
Smithsonian Magazine. Swine have all
sorts of human qualities. Experiments
showed they are no more enthusiastic
about running laps than the average
person is. They are sedentary and
unathletic. They have a sweet tooth and
hit the sauce a little heavily some-
times.

A Missouri test showed pigs are
susceptible to alcoholism like people. A
group was given unlimited access to an
alcoholic beverage. The dominant
member of the group ‘drank to excess
and thereby lost his choice sleeping
spot to an abstemious companion as a
result. But then like a sinner who has
suddenly seen the light, he voluntarily

weifit on the wagon and regained his
tur . ' .

Hogs have a sense of values, some-
times superior to people’s.

 




THE TAMPA TRIBUNE - 11/5/85

EDITORIAL

Wise Animal Research

ou can’t please everyone, but
the Senate did the next best
thing last week when it passed legis-
lation to ensure that animals used in
research are treated humanely.
The measure increases the num-
ber of laboratory inspections, pro-
vides stricter penalties for violations
and requires painkillers or euthana-
sia'for animals suffering in experi-
ments. The bill also requires scien-
tists to have prior training in animal.
care, establish a computerized infor-

mation service so that no research .

using animals is duplicated, and
mandates caged dogs and primates
be; given adequate, exercise.

The bill is supported by the Hu-
mane Society and the American
Physiological Society, which repre~
sei‘i‘ts the largest group of scientists
who conduct experiments with ani-
mals.

Such support is warranted. The
billnensures proper care for the ani-

mals without giving sway to the -

quirky demands of the animal rights
activists. These antivivisectionists
‘oppose the bill because it does not
stop all animal experiments. Their
arguments that medical research

can be conducted without animals,
by using computers or other meth-
ods, should not be taken seriously by
anyone concerned with the welfare
of the human species.

What should be taken seriously is
the abuse of animals during re-
search. Though some animal-welfare
groups exaggerate the frequency,
outrages do occur.

Revolting proof was obtained last
year when animal-rights militants
broke into the University of Pennsyl-
vania and took 60 hours of videotape
showing baboons having their head
bashed in to the apparent amuse-
ment of the researchers. The experi-
ment had little medical value.

Such cases are the exception. In
most medical facilities, including the
University of South Florida’s, the
welfare of the animals is a priority.
Medical researchers obtain satisfac-
tion from discovering ways to dimin-
ish suffering, not inflict it.

~ Still, even occasional laboratory
brutality should not be tolerated. The
Senate’s bill goes a long way toward

seeing that it is not.

TEL AVIV, Israel —- Eli and Edgar were two of the
biggest crowd-pleasers in the city.‘ They fascinated chil-
dren with their somersaults and earned good money for
their owners. But city officials said last week that the

, dolphins died in pain and neglect.

Eli and Edgar performed at the city’s Dolphinarium
Marineland, a seaside complex owned by a private con-
sortium of American and Swiss businessmen.

Their deaths in October, just three weeks apart,
sparked a city inquiry during which veterinarians and
trainers spoke of appalling conditions at the dolphinari-
um.

In response, the last of the dolphin trainers and feed-
ers quit their jobs Thursday. The two surviving dolphins
are being fed by volunteers. The city council is threaten-
ing to shut down the marineland once its inquiry is com-
pleted.

City officials believe that Eli and Edgar died “be-
cause of problems with the food, problems in the water
and general neglect,” said Frieda Strauss, a city spokes-
woman.

But the dolphinarium’s maintenance manager, Yoel
Ben-Haim, told The Associated Press that the allegations
of neglect were “slander” and that the dolphin deaths,
so close together, were a coincidence. Eli died of a liver
infection, while Edgar contracted a lung infection, Ben-
Haim said.

He said the dolphinarium would never again have a
star like Eli. “We put tens of thousands of dollars into
training and keeping him. He was a special dolphin.”

Dolphins, a protected species, are highly regarded
for their intelligence, their ability to communicate with
each other and their friendliness toward humans.

Eli, a favorite with children and adults, could catch a
fish held 20 feet above the water, perform a double
somersault, sing on command, dance on his tail fin and

carry a trainer on his back.
At age 6, he was the oldest of the four marineland

dolphins, but he died young since the average dolphin
lives 25 years.

Eli was captured soon after birth by Israeli fisher- /

men off the Red Sea coast of the Sinai desert and
trained in Israel. Edgar, along with the two surviving
dolphins, was purchased from Los Angeles’ Marineland.

The US. Department of Agriculture stipulates that
all exported dolphins must be cared for professionally
and be given carefully regulated food, large aquariums
and fresh water.

“These things just were not done,” said a veterinary
source close to the case who spoke to the AP on condi-
tion of anonymity. He said he was not permitted to speak
publicly until the results of the city inquiry were

released.

 

“The Tel Aviv dolphinarium is probably the worst ,

I’ve seen in all my travels,” said Linda Kochki, a South
African regarded by local veterinarians as the only

qualified dolphin trainer the marineland ever had. She .

spoke Wednesday night on Israel Television. Thursday,

she left the country.
In addition to the deaths of Eli and Edgar, five

sharks died on one night six weeks ago and a sea lion
also has died, Israel Radio reported.

Nov. 18, 1985

The ritual, worthy of royalty, begins
just before 11 am. each day in the lob-
by of the Peabody, a Memphis land-
mark that styles itself “The South’s
Grand Hotel.” First a 50-foot red car-
pet is rolled out from the hotel’s eleva-
tor bank to' the ornate fountain in the
lobby. Then a tape-recorded voice
calls for attention, and finally, at 11
sharp, when the hotel’s guests have
jostled themselves as close to the car-
pet as possible, the door of the ex-
press elevator slides open. Cameras
flash and the long-awaited passengers
walk—well, waddle—out.

They are ducks. Not your everyday
vile canards, mind you. Oh, no. These
are the Peabody Marching Ducks.
While the hotel speakers blare The
Stars and Stripes Forever or King Cot-
ton, the five fearless fowls, accompa-
nied by their trainer carrying a duck-
headed cane, troop down the red
carpet, stride with plumed aplomb up
to the fountain and duck in for a swim.
Amazing, you say. Miraculous! Walt,
there’s more: At 5 pm, they do the
whole routine in reverse.

Lest anyone think that the people at
the Peabody make a big fuss about
ducks because there’s nothing better
to watch, let it be noted that the hotel
has played host to Bob Hope, Helen
Hayes, Jesse Jackson, Robert Mitch-
um and most recently Prince,,who
rented the entire ninth floor. But while
those folks were just passing through,
the Peabody Marching Ducks have
been in residence since 1932. That’s
when the hotel manager returned from
a hunting trip and decided to lodge his
live decoys (legal at the time) in the
fountain. The arrangement was for-
malized in 1940 when the hotel hired a
former Ringling Brothers animal han—
dler, Edward Pembroke, to put its
ducks in a row. Pembroke, the man
with the cane, is still doing it at age 76
and maintains, “Ducks are as trainable
as any pet. The only time I have a prob-
lem is when someone stands in the
way or tries to get a picture straight

“They just know when it’s 5 o’clock, no-
body has to tell them,” says Pembroke
(with his charges in the elevator).

on—that makes the ducks go every
which way.”

The hotel was closed from 1975 to
1981, turning the pride of the Peabody,
quite literally, into ducks out of water.
its new owner, however, has reducker-
ated with a vengeance. Tiny duck im-
prints are embedded in the hotel soap
and in its ash urns; chocolate foil ducks
show up on turned—down beds. The
restaurant is called “Dux,” but for sen-
timental reasons, no duck is served
there, roasted or otherwise. Best of all
is the Royal Duck Palace, a penthouse

features a large mural, two draped cu-
polas, a fountain and something called
a Royal Bed Chamber. It is also carpet-
ed, since delicate duck feet are sen-
sitive to concrete.

Says Hawkins, justifiably proud, “it’s
a little kingdom of their own—like
Camelot for ducks.” But Pembroke,
who after all has been in the duck busi-
ness for quite some time, tops her.
Says he: “It’s even more than it was
quacked up to be.” El

DAYTON DAILY NEWS - Nov. 8, 1985

Veteran veterinarian

He’s made a career of giving creatures comfort

By Renate Frydman

After 37 years, Dr. Richard Reinhard closed
the doors on his Harrison Twp. veterinary prac»
tice. It was Sept. 26, his 43rd wedding
anniversary.

For Reinhard and his wife Ruth, “It was
tough to walk away. We spent the whole day
crying with our clients and their pets,” said the
doctor, whose rapport with the animals is said
to rival that of Dr. Doolittle.

Many a sick member of the animal kingdom
has benefited from Reinhard’s professional care
and from the animated personality‘of his wife,
Ruth Reinhard. They’ve been a team 24 hours a
day, sharing every tense, tender, turbulent mo-
ment with the owners and their valued pets.
There were ridiculously funny times and some
that “pulled your heartstrings,” she recalls.

Incidents stand out —- like the time Reinhard
operated on an exotic tr0pical fish with a pro-
lapsed rectum under water in an aquarium.

“The owner brought in the fish in its tank
semi-conscious,” says Reinhard. She had tried
some home-remedy surgery, “sewing it togeth-

er herself. She brought some green solution to
put into the water to anesthetize him. I operat-
ed underwater and at one point said to Ruth,
who was holding the limp fish, ‘I think it’s
dead. Relax on it.’ She lossened her hold and it
flopped out of the tank. She just scooped it back
up and we finished the operation," Reinhard
says with a chuckle.

Then there was the bird that died of fright. A
woman brought a parakeet into the office in a
cage. “1 reached in, put my hands in front of it,
and almost like something you see in a cartoon,
the parakeet swings out a little and falls over
dead. I hadn’t touched it. The bird’s owner ran
down Main Street screaming, ‘He killed my
bird,’ ” the vet recalls.

Also unfOrgettable was a big old red Rhode
Island rooster. Mrs. Reinhard remembers see-
ing him sitting on the long sofa in their waiting
room next to his owner. Over the years, the
rooster saw the doctor for everything from an
infection to removal of a small tumor on his
thigh.

Throughout the years, Ruth Reinhard has
been the right-hand person, the indisposable

‘andherewaethie y.

Dr. Richard Reinhard and his wife, Ruth, worked as a team during his career

assistant, the sidekick in a comedy team de-
signed to put owner and pet at ease.

“I couldn’t have done without her. It was like
having seven people around. She made the peo-
ple (in the office) feel at ease and happy,” he
says, and she adds, “If the people were at ease,
the animal was at ease.”

Always obvious is the admiration and devo-A

tion the couple feels for each other. They said

THE TAMPA TRIBUNE - NOV. 8, 1985

City decides policing vicious dogs is a tab for the county

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune Staff 'Writer'

The Tampa City Council decided
Thursday it had bitten off more than
it wanted to chew on by itself when
delving into the possible adoption of
a law to control vicious dogs.

The council, therefore, deter-
. mined it would be best to join with
Hillsborough County in policing vi-
cious dogs and the illegal sport of
dog fighting, rather than adopting a
separate city ordinance.

The decision was made upon the
recommendation of Public Safety

The City Council was advised not to adopt a
vicious dog ordinance singling out pit bulls,
but to work with county Animal Control

officials instead.

 

conducted a study on the issues after
Councilman Lee Duncan recom-
mended something be done to con-
trol pit bull terriers in the city.
Smith, who submitted a three-
page report to the council,recom-
mended against a vicious dog law
that would single out pit bull terri-
ers, saying the courts almost assur-

edly would declare it unconstitution-
al. ~
But Smith said there is a problem
with vicious animals and “the illegal
sport of dog fighting.” Smith said re-
cent reports indicate “isolated areas

in the city where they are having ’

backyard dog fights."
Between October 1983 and Sep-

tember 1981i, “.In'iith said til? dog;
bite-1 limit. iii‘Eil’l reported, 556 cat
bites and IS?) lilies from other ani-
mals such as nurses. Besides that,
Smith said about 40 percent of the
actual annuals bites aren’t reported.

“But inasmuch as the County
Commission has indicated a desire
to address the issue of vicious ani-

"mals on a countywide basis, it is

recommended that representatives
of the city join with them in an effort
to develop an effective solution,”
Smith said.

If the city passed its own law’,
Smith said the city would have to
hire enforcement personnel and

Administrator Robert L. Smith, who

5

 

\f

build animal shelters "which could
duplicate existing county services.”

Smith said he is currently hold-
ing meetings with Hillsborough
County Public Safety Director Gil
Rodriguez and Animal Control Di-
rector Dan Gorman to write a new
law or make amendments to existing
regulations. Council members asked
Smith to report back to them in
January on the progress made with
Gorman and Rodriguez.

. As a minimum provision, Smith
said, an existing county law should
be changed to “penalize owners of

vicious animals and those who re-
peatedly permit their animals to run
loose." '

“The real culprits,” Smith said,
“are the owners who irresponsibly
turn their animals out to roam the
streets both morning and night,
those who refuse to neuter or spay
their animals, those who abandon
them on the streets, those who with-
hold basic care and those persons
holding illegal pit bull fights.”

"Attempts to deal with the prob-
lem by the passage of leash laws
have not proven successful,” Smith
said.

 

Under the current county leash
law, a person can be fined $500 or
sentenced to jail for 60 days for a
violation. In addition, a pet owner is
charged an imaounding fee of $20
on an initial offense when an animal
is picked up by Animal Control.
There also is a $3 per day boarding
fee, and the impoundment fee goes
up to $40 on a second offense.

Smith said a person organizing
an illegal dog fight can be charged
with a felony but that'participants
only face misdemeanor charges, re-
sulting in fines of up to $500 or jail
terms of up to 60 days.

Raini Sequoya, president of the
Tampa-based National Animal

Rights inc., endorsed Smith’s report
after the council meeting. But Se-
quoya said he would work to change
existing law to allow any participant
in an illegal dog fight to be charged
with a felony, thus allowing a stiffer
sentence and fine. ’

Duncan also expressed satisfac-
tion with Smith’s report, saying he
always wanted the city and county to
work on the problem together.

S-B ‘ THE TAMPA TRIBUNE, Friday, November 8,1985

Inventor’s ‘better barbell’ just one of i
his passions

By GREG MYRE
Associated Press

OCALA — Arthur Jones nevercould figure the merit
in thinking small even when times were! lean, which
may help explain why he now keeps 600 crocodiles, 500
snakes, 85 elephants, three rhinos and a gorilla in his
back yard.

You could question the wisdom of collecting danger-
ous beasts and dreaming of breeding 8-foot rattlesnakes
and 20-foot crocodiles, but those who know Jones as a
millionaire inventor, pilot, animal hunter, gun lover and
ardent right winger wouldn’t expect anything less.

Jones is, among many things, the eccentric genius
behind Nautilus exercise equipment, a series of ma-
chines that streamlined the medieval torture rack and
became the Yuppie barbell that now graces more than
4,000 sweat emporiums nationwide.

It was Nautilus that made him rich and famous, but
Jones’ greatest invention was simply his one-of-a-kind
personality.

Jones’ caustic tongue and his passion for wild beasts,
' rapid planes, small arms and beautiful women has
created a mystique that has drawn business executives,
doctors, coaches, athletes, journalists and the merely
curious to Jumbo Lair, his 600-acre ranch in Central
Florida.

To facilitate the process, Jones has built a 7,500-foot
airport runway next to his home, enabling his fleet of
planes to bring the masses to him so he can explain the
wonders of Nautilus. If the visitors aren’t interested in
Nautilus, then Jones will show them'his snake house
with ' 500 cobras, rattlers and pythons that live one
locked door away from 2,000 unsuspecting mice and
rats. In short, he seldom bores his guests.

A man like this needs a motto, and Jones’ is: “bigger
crocodiles, faster planes and younger women.”

His biggest crocodile is Gomic, a 17-foot, 1,600-pound
monster that Jones has favored with a private pen and
house. Gomic eats 50 pounds of meat per sitting and is
partial to fresh-skinned rats. Jones’ other crocodiles and
alligators share accommodations.

His fastest plane is a Boeing 707 that Jones keeps on
his runway and in which he hopes his wife will set an
around-the-world speed record in early 1986.

His younger woman is 23-year-old Terri, wife No. 5,
author of “How to Look Terrific in a Bathing Suit,” and a
lady so physically fit that Nautilus workouts would seem

redundant

Conversely, Jones is a chain-smoker who hasn’t used
his own equipment or exercised regularly in five years.

He’s around 61 (he’s not telling), horseshoe bald with a
slight paunch, and his face is as lined and leathery as a

 

rhino’s hide.

A pair of horn-rimmed glasses constantly slide down
his nose, and his eyelids are perpetually at half-mast,
the result of a lifetime spent squinting into a tropical
sun.

Jones" adventures are too implausible even for Indi-
ana Jones; he has been a pilot in several wars, flown
more than 30,000 hours in everything from helicopters
to 8-255, exported animals from Africa and South Amer-
ica, and produced syndicated animal-adventure televi-
sion shows such as “Wild Cargo.”

Jones does little to discourage his re

“Shoot them all” Jones says “The ’

damn bit of good, and we’d be better off without them.”
.Past quotes attributed to Jones stretch the bounds of
believabihty. For example: “I’ve killed 600 elephants

and 73 men in my life, and I’m more

Pet Social Worker’s Style Is Going to the Dogs

Warren Eckstein Makes a Healthy Living Providing Therapy for Animals

’ By MIKE EBERTS

Warren Eckstein calls himself
the Leo Buscaglia of dog-human
relations. “I'll be walking down the

street and somebody will be walk-
ing a dog,” the 37-year-old New

York native said. “Not thinking, I’ll .

bend down, give the dog a kiss and
continue to walk, never saying a
word to the owner. Only later will I
wonder what that person" must
have thought.” ‘

1 Such antics have landed him a
radio talk show in New York,
regular appearances on “Hour
Magazine," guest spots on the “Da-
vid Letterman Show" (including a
“Tribute to Rodents" and “Basic
Pig Training") and a booming
bicoastal business as a “pet social
worker.” He has also authored two
books: “Yes Dog, That's Right” (a
basic dog training manual) and
“Pet Aerobics.” In January, Holt,
Rinehart & Winston will publish
“Understanding Your Pet: The
Eckstein Approach to Behavior.”

;. For $100 to $300 an hour, plus

expenses, he will visit pet and
owner at home, observing the
former and interviewing the latter,
assess their environment, and rec-
ommend a treatment designed to
make at least one of them happier.
Although dogs make up the brunt
of his caseload, he also works with
cats, birds, pigs, goats, goldfish
and—once—a tarantula.

Not surprisingly, Eckstein re —>
ports he has “always been an
animal fanatic.

, “I remember asa young child on

Long Island there was a creek
behind my house," he said. “I
brought home a rat, convinced my
parents it was a muskrat gone bald,
named it and kept it in my house for
six months until my parents got the
idea that the hair wasn’t growing
back' and that it was just an old
brown rat. But he was a good
friend."

Today, Eckstein lives in a farm- .

house outside Albany, N.Y., with
his wife, Fay, two pigs, two ham-
sters, a guinea pig, six chickens, six
ducks, five dogs, 22 rabbits, a
mouse, two gerbils, a hamster and
two parrots. When at home, he
often jogs with his two pigs, Spat
and Corky.

When he is away, Eckstein calls
home to talk to his dogs over the
speaker on his telephone answer-
ing machine. “I'll say, ‘Hi Tige, Hi
Shannon, Hi Shep, Hi Muggs, Hi

Honey. There are bones for you.

upstairs and we’ll play soccer when
I get home.‘ "

Hands-and-Knees Approach

A large part of pet-human rela-
tions, Eckstein contends, is show-
ing the animal affection. “If he’s
doing something right, hug and kiss

the dog,” Eckstein said. “I have yet '

to see a dog that has received a lot
of hugging and kissing that wasn’t
pretty well adjusted."

Getting down on hands and
knees is also important, Eckstein
believes, because dogs have prob-~
lems communicating with upright,

two-legged humans. “The reason

dogs jump up on people is that they
want to communicate,” he said.
“Can you imagine living in a soci-
ety where everyone around you is
15 feet tall? The only way you have
of communicating is to jump up on
them.” .

He suggests that dog owners
spend 15 minutes each day on
hands and knees playing with their
dogs. “You’ve gotten that need for
communication out of his system,"
Eckstein said.

He calls himself a pet social
worker instead of a pet psycholo-
gist or animal trainer because he
believes there are few bad animals,
just animals reacting to stress, fear
or other noisome conditions.

A Part of the Family

Perhaps another reason for his
non-traditional job title is his lack
of traditional educational creden-

tials. His bachelor's degree is in

human psychology. After gradua-
tion, he studied under European
animal behavioralists, but did not
earn a graduate degree. Eckstein
considers his most important quali-
fication the thousands of pets he
has observed and treated.

“The problem is you can’t take
an animal, put it in a human
environment, treat it like an ani-
mal, and expect it. to act like a
human,” he said “I don’t even
accept the word pet so much any
more. They are really family mem-
bers now.”

He believes owners should strive
to have a socially well—adjusted
pet, not merely a pet that is
obedient. “I have people who once
a week have a party for their pets,”
he said. “Neighbors—both people
and pets—come. There is a bridge
mix for the people and a bridge mix
for the pets. They can all socialize.

“I also suggest people taking
their dogs or cats on picnics, or a
trip to the beach or a ride in the
car.” '

Pet relaxation is important, Eck—
stein argues, because changing life
styles in the 19808 have “trans-
ferred stresses from one end of the
leash to the other.”

For example, he sees problems

particular to the upwardly mobile
pet. “The two-income family that
postpones child-bearing for a few
years . . . will often adopt a dog to
essentially be the kid," he said.
“They bring presents for it. They
‘ooh’ and ‘ah’ over it. The grand-
parents come over and call it the
‘grandpuppy’ or the fgranddog.’

“Two years down the line it is
time for baby number one. Sudden-
1y this dog is being shunned. I don’t
accept that. I make people stop and
tell them that if they are going to
play with the baby, they must play
with the pet. The pet was there
first.

“Otherwise, there can be a sib-
ling rivalry between pet and baby.”

He contends that most problems

ECKSTEIN

Continued from Page 16
with dogs stem from three common
situations: The dog is never given a
chance to show dominant behavior,
it is treated inconsistently, or it
does not receive adequate exercise.
“You go to the typical American
family: Ma, Pa, 2.5 kids and Grand-
ma and Grandpa living around the
corner,” he said. “Everyone is

' consistently telling the dog ‘Do

this. Don’t do that. Correct this.
Correct that.’

‘Dog Is the Only Indian’
“The problem is . . . you have all

chiefs and the dog is the only .

Indian. So any time it has a chance
to show some dominant behavior,
be it with a child or a neighbor, the
dog is going to take full advantage,
and understandably so. If everyone
in my household was above me, I
was the only member and everyone
else was the leader, I would be
challenging the same way.”

He maintains that animal behav-
ior problems are aggravated when
pets are bored and out of shape.
“You see obese cats that can’t jump
on the furniture anymore and dogs
that don’t chase cats anymore,” he
said. ‘

Included in “Pet Aerobics” are
directions on puppy push-ups, dog—
gie sit-ups, jumping jacks and dog
dancing. “If a dog can lie down and
stand up and you get it to go down,
up, down, up, you have a push-up.
Sit, stand, sit, stand, you have a
sit-up,” he said.

Another exercise he recom-
mends is dog dancing. “It is incred-
ible how many closet dog dancers I
found when I was putting the book
together,” he said.

“When a good song comes on the

radio,” he Said, the owners Will
“pick up those dogs’ legs and
they’ll dance around the room with
them.”

Other athletic activities he rec-
ommends for pets are hiking
(“They make backpacks for
dogs”), jogging, speed walking,
soccer, Frisbee and tetherball.

Perhaps the best illustration of
Eckstein’s unusual brand of social-
work is to select a few of the 30,000
cases he has worked over the last
16 years. . j .

One was the case of a dog whose
owner had been through a. bitter
divorce in which “the husband
would come home and yell and
scream and sometimes take his
aggressions out on the dog,” Eck-
stein said.

“A woman called me up and said
‘Warren, 1 can’t date.’ I said, ‘May-
be you’re calling the wrong thera-
pist.’ But the problem was that her
dog would not accept any man
coming near her in that house. The
dog felt challenged and threatened
and became overly protective.”

He said the woman had consul-t-
ed several mainstream animal be-
havioralists who suggested she get
rid of the dog or correct its behav-
ior with a system of rewards or
punishments. Eckstein said his
suggestion was to “put the dog on
the couch” and deal with the
underlying problem.

“It was a fear response on the
dog’s part,” he said. “I took a
desensitizing approach. I used a
cassette tape recorder and taped
men speaking very softly. I came to
the house as a potential date,
brought ﬂowers for the woman and
dog biscuits for the dog to establish

a relationship. .

“Then I had her take the dog out
to meet me on the street in a
non-threatening .situation. The dog

didn’t have to protect his turf. It
took about 31/2 months, but it
worked out fine.”

Sixteen years ago, friends and
acquaintances literally found Eck-
stein’s career aspirations unbeliev-
able. “But now it’s worse than
being a doctor or a lawyer,” he said.

three different ways, are among 14
members of class 431 at Northern
.. 4.12alifornia’s Guide Dogs for the
""rd training center. On gradua-
tiozi‘day, they will receive a leash
zistead of a diploma from young-
sters who helped raise - from
. puppies —— the dogs trained to be
.th'eir constant companions.
sThe American Association for
the Blind said there are many new
products on the market for the ‘
blind and visually impaired such
as talking clocks, Braille calcula-
05. and items to make cooking
and household chores easier. But,
outdoor mobility aids other than
canes and trained dogs are still in
the experimental stages.

There are some devices, such as
‘hetrrping canes” that use comput-
erized sensors to detect objects

~ and so help avoid a collision, but

they are expensive and often

fjbulky. Still to be marketed are

._ardry as infrared cameras that en-

:Elble a person to “see” the shapes
of objects.

“The dog as a mobility partner
has been around at least since the
days of Pompeii and will be
around for a very long time,” said
guide dog school spokeswoman
lennifer Bassing.

_ ( 5; dog does more than ,

she said. “The dog is a

" companion, a partner in every

sense of the word. In many ways it , _
gives a person a whole new outlook !

on life, a reason to get up in the
morning because they have a liv-
ing being dependent on them for
food, care and exercise.

“This kind of companionship is

something that no new technolgy
can replace.”

blind new outlook on life

“He’s not a magic wand, but
he’ll make travel much easier for
me,” said Rogers, who has trained
with his golden retriever, “Rick,”
on the busy streets of downtown
San Rafael and along the steep
hills of San Francisco.

Rogers said he’s always on the
go when he’s home in Florida and
belongs to a “rap group” of people
who had sight and lost it. He took
part in a “white cane awareness
day” in Fort Lauderdale in J anu-
ary when some 85 people with
canes and dog guides marched
several blocks to the court house
to draw attention to the way blind
people can be recognized.

“The first thing to learn is that
life doesn’t stop because you’re
blind,” said Rogers, a former bus-
boy who aspires to be a counselor.

“I got shot in the head and

. thank the Lord I’m alive. I had the
good fortune to have seen and
known the colors, the girls and all

that good stuff.”

In an innovative program pio-
neered at the grassy, 11-acre site,
three breeds of puppies are raised
by local volunteer 4-H members
from age 3 to 18 months. They are
then returned for a formal five-

' month training period before being

matched with their new owners.
About 50 percent of the dogs ——
golden Labrador retrievers, black
Labrador retrievers and German
shepherds — pass the require-
ments for guide work. Those that
fail are returned as pets to the

‘ puppy raisers who helped socialize

 

Rogers, 23, who was shot in the
head and blinded in an accident in
the Florida Everglades three
years ago, said he decided a guide
dog was the only alternative he
had for the fast mobility he desired
for his lifestyle.

and house train the dogs.
People selected for guide dog

training at the school, a charitable ‘

organization, must be legally blind
and physically able to care for and
handle the canine without assis-
tance. They spend 28 days in a rig-
orous program at the center and
everything is free.

When they graduate, they’re
part of a select group. Of the
500,000 legally blind people in the
United States, only 1 percent use a
trained dog. Many of these are
people who had sight and lost it
from accident or disease. Of the to-
tal number of blind people, ap—
proximately 97,000 were born that
way and many of these also use
dogs.

“These aren’t poor, unfortunate
blind people who come here,”
Bassing said. ”They’re people who

 

nave made important, positive de-
cisions about where they want
their life to go.”

The purebred dogs are picked
for their even disposition, medium
size, short coats and ability to
work. The pups are born at the
school and when they reach 3
months old are placed in the
homes of 4-H members in Califor-
nia, Oregon, Washington, Nevada,
(Arizona, Utah, Idaho and Colora-

0.

At about 18 months, the dogs un-

dergo training that starts with ba-

sic obedience to commands and

advances to specialized work with

a special leather harness. Instruc-
. tors finally put on blindfolds and
work the dogs on the streets of
.2 suburban San Rafael, learning to
stop at intersections and to avoid
obstacles. The dogs are also
taught to disobey an owner’s com-
mand if it isn’t safe to proceed.
; These are dogs that are happi-
5 er working than lying around the
house,” said Bassing. “About 50
percent of those that go into train-
ing get rejected. We’re looking for
a dog that’s as perfect as possible.
We want its owner to feel confident
,. that the dog is perfectly trained

Upon completion of the training,
the school will have spent $10,000
per dog-person unit, the money
coming from private donations
through a membership program.

is one of eight in the nation and the

“Cane travel was always scary
for me, I had to feel my way
around obstacles,” said Kraus,
who lost his sight two years ago as
a result of detached retinas. “With
a dog, I feel as free as a bird, al-
most.”

Ostwald, of Forest Hills, N.Y.,
said he hopes “Walt,” a black Lab-
rador, will give him more indepen-
dence and some needed compan-
ionship.

. .“I spend most of my time in the
middle of Manhattan, and I’m

frankly apprehensive about wheth-
er travel with a dog will be better
.than cane travel,” said Ostwald,
who suffers from retinitis pigmen-
tosis and gradually lost his sight
over the years.

“I hope I’m emotionally ready
to accept a dog as a partner. I’ve
always relied on myself and com-
panions, but I’m more alone than
before and that’s been my basic
motivating factor.”

Hugh Tiebault, director of the
Latham Foundation in Alameda,
Calif, said studies of human-ani-
mal bonding show the dogs are
more than just a mobility aid for
blind people.

“Unlike an electronic gadget,
they become a friend,” he said.
“They help build responsibilities
and relationships that the blind
would otherwise have with other
maple and with life. They help
with the psychological, emotional
side of life.”

separate facilities near the tigers.
Their habitats are smaller yet the
cats seem just as at home and
pleased with their new environ-
ments as the white tigers.

Phase II of, the cat compound,
which is currently under construc-
tion, will consist of three moated,
mtural looking habitats similar to
the white tigers’. These will house
Siberian tigers, mountain lions

and snow leopards that the zoo

plans’to acquire at a later date.

jiilthough the White tigers are
the biggest stars of the Houston
Zoo, they are by no means the only

' reason for visiting.

“Colobus monkeys are another
outstanding new exhibit. They
were acquired by the zoo about
two months ago and are located
near the entrance in a new, huge
black cage.

’ The Colobus monkeys are distin-
guished by the white markings on
their black fur — a white trill cir-
cles their faces and runs down the
length of their backs on both sides
and comes together to form along,
bushy white tail. They also are
special in that they have no
thumbs. In fact, “Colobus” means
mutilated one, because the people
who first discovered them thought
that someone had chapped off
their thumbs. ‘

Colobus monkeys eat almost
nothing but leaves and spend most
of the day chasing each other or
swinging from their tree in the
cage.

,f you have children, don’t miss
the children’s zoo. There, the
kids can pet goats and rab-
bits, look at falcons and owls up
close, try their hand at milking a
cow and watch baby chick eggs
hatch. The children’s zoo also has
a- hands-on laboratory for both
children and adults. In the lab,
visitors can touch animal skins,
play games that test their animal
IQ or play with the bones of vari-
ous animals.

“‘We’ve found that this is a very
popular project,” Werler says.
“People just don’t have an oppor-
tunity to do these kinds of things
every day.”

The tropical bird house is anoth-
er favorite. More than just an ex-
hibit of brightly colored finches,
.love birds and parrots from South
America and Africa, the bird
house also boasts a tropical rain

forest reminiscent of scenes from

an Indiana Jones movie. .
After viewing the birds in their

glass houses, the exhibit leads you ;
through a set of doors that open i
onto a concrete bridge that ap— :

pears to have been carved by
tribesmen from the jungles of

Thailand. All around you are
tropical birds, plants and other
lush vegetation growing in a warm
humid environment. You exit the
exhibit after crossing another

; bridge -— this time one made of
.1 wood and rope.

R “,Then there are the traditional

zao animals, without which a zoo
would not be a zoo: huge brown
kgdiac .bears, who lumber around
on their moated rock platform
splashing in their water puddles,
small black Asiatic bears, who
wave to encourage the kids to toss
them peanuts, hippopotamuses
who spend most of their day snooz-

ing, snorting and yawning in their
huge pool, and the monkeys who
are always trying to steal the
show.

The zoo also has several gi-
raffes, who spend their day chew-
ing on leaves and casting con-
temptuous glances at their short
VlSltOI‘S, elephants, a couple of ze-
bras and a reptile house filled with

.slithering venomous and non-ven-

omous snakes and lizards. For

some reason, the reptile house
seems to remain constantly
crowded.

If you haven’t been to the zoo
since the mid-1970s, you will notice
some other changes as well. For
example, the front of the zoo has
been completely remodeled. Gone
is the 200’s old gate and columns.
Now there is an expansive patio,
new concession stand serving ev-
erything from chicken fingers to

hot dogs (and selling for $2.85 or
less), a new administration build-
ing, and the Kipp Aquarium,
which houses tropical fish of some
of the most exotic colors, shapes
and sizes you’ll ever see.

One thing that hasn’t changed
about the zoo, though, is parking.
Werler freely admits there just
isn’t enough. In all, the zoo has
only 1,200 parking spaces and on
an average day in the summer,

8,000 to 10,000 people will walk
through its gates.

So if you go to the zoo on the
weekend, the best time is Satur-
day mornings in the fall and early
winter. There’ll be fewer people,
more parking spaces available
and, the animals tend to be friski- -
er

The zoo is open every day of the
week from 9:30 a.m. to 8 pm. in
the spring and summer and from

9:30 a.m. to 6 pm. in the fall and
winter. Stroller rentals are avail-
able at the front gate near the gift
shop, where you can buy souve-
nirs, commemorative pencils, fake
snakes, T-shirts and the like.
Wheelchairs may be reserved by
calling the 200’s security office at
520-3259. For further information,
call the zoo at 523-5888.

And don’t forget to check out
those cool cats, man.

M. Lilran/ Paris Match

 

It has become a familiar scene in
Italy, France and other parts of
Europe. A car loaded with lug-
gage pulls to the side of a high-
way. A dog is thrown out onto the
shoulder, the door slams and the
car speeds away.

' Every summer, thousands of
pets are abandoned when their
owners go on vacation. Some of

 

 

 

the animals find homes or learn to
fend for themselves; many are
struck by cars or trucks and killed.
To dramatize the problem—in a
somewhat bizarre but effective
manner—French photographer
Manuel Litran worked with the hu-
mane society of France to collect
the corpses of 60 abandoned pets
that had perished in traffic around

 

 

Paris. He arranged their bodies
on a highway that was closed for
construction and took this star-
tling picture.

Answers to the epidemic are
hard to come by—but authorities
are trying some novel approaches.
One example: the town of Casa-
lecchio di Reno, near Bologna,
has ruled that all dogs and cats

 

will have to be registered and
marked with a painless tattoo. If a
pet is abandoned, his owner would
be fined $250. And a member of
the Italian parliament recently pro-
posed a bill to make such registra-
tion mandatory throughout the
country. Alas, officials doubt that it
can be made law in time to avert
next summer’s slaughter. O

OHN JEFFREY MCPARTLIN rose early on that Friday
morning in June 1984. At first light, he climbed
into a blue VW Rabbit and drove two miles to the
Holiday Inn on busy 10th Street, a strip on the
south side of Great Falls, Montana. He circled the
streets surrounding the motel until he found an
alley that gave him clear line-of—sight to one of the
rooms. Like a hunter fixing his quarry, he took a
spotting-scope from the seat beside him and
focused on the door.

McPartlin knew the man inside would soon be
arrested by US. Marshals and agents of the US.
Fish and Wildlife Service. It was a moment Mc-
Partlin was not about to miss. In a year’s time, he
had come to know Glen Luckman, the Canadian
who was to be arrested, all too well.

Tall and ruggedly built, McPartlin is a 39 year old
master falconer who had traveled to Canada to in-
spect Birds of Prey International and Game Farm,
Inc., the breeding project Luckman ran with an
Englishman named John Slaytor. McPartlin had
listened carefully when Luckman told him the
project was used to ”launder” eggs and young
birds of prey taken illegally from their nests, that
wild hawks and falcons were sold as captive-bred
raptors through this legal front. McPartlin had
even gone with Luckman on a trapping expedition
deep into the Canadian Arctic, to a remote and
frozen spot up the Boothia Peninsula, 600 miles
from Greenland’s west coast. Working alone for
the most part, in a blind he’d built outside a small
Inuit Eskimo village, McPartlin caught the first
female white gyrfalcon ever taken for commercial-
ization through the Inuit’s sanctioned ”harvesting"
arrangement with the Northwest Territories.

The two men also caught a male gyr, and in the
companionable setting of this successful trip,

OPERATION FALCON continued

Canada and Europe. He trapped for
them, traveled with them and opened
his home to them.

McPartlin and Operation Falcon are
not without their critics. Very vocal in
condemning this post-ABSCAM
”sting” has been the North American
Falconers' Association (NAFA), an

organization of some 2,000 members, '

some of whom were charged in the

wake of Operation Falcon. One criti- .

cism is that in capturing or purchasing
wild birds for sale on the black
market, government agents endan-
gered the resource they were sup-
posed to protect. The agents contend
the birds were needed to lure the traf-
fickers, that the number taken was
small compared to the number spared
from future theft. NAFA claims in its
newsletter that the black market for
raptors cited by the Operation Falcon
investigators simply does not exist to
the degree claimed and that the over-
seas prices for birds are wildly exag-
gerated. Another NAFA claim is that
honest falconers were entrapped by
the agents, lured into illegal acts by
deals ”too good to refuse.” McPartlin’s

 

response: ”Those people [indicted]
are not true falconers; they’re wildlife
bandits. They know and the good
lord knows they weren’t entrapped.
They were driven by greed—greed for
certain birds, or for money—and they
were caught.”

Immediately after the takedown,
government witness McPartlin was
bound to silence until court cases
were resolved. Defendants and their
fartisans spoke freely to reporters,
4 however, vilifying Operation Falcon
and its main undercover man. Mc-
Partlin was referred to as a ”convicted
felon,” based on a single 1972 misde-
meanor violation of wildlife law that
resulted in a $200 civil fine. Once Mc-
Partlin was free to speak, Operation
Falcon was no longer news; the
damage had been done.

On the other hand, the Audubon
Society has praised Operation Falcon
before Congress for its “extraordinary
undercover work.” And in November
of 1985, Jeff and Anne McPartlin were
honored in Washington by both the
Fish and Wildlife Service and the
Monitor Consortium, an affiliation of
some 30 conservation groups.

”The awards are very nice," says Mc-

 

 

Partlin, ”but what means more to me
is that we’ve come out of this with ;
some 50 guilty pleas, nearly $250,000
in fines imposed and the
knowledge that we’ve virtually
broken the backbone of the inter-
national black market in birds of prey.”

These days Jeff McPartlin works ;
with his brother in a real estate busi-
ness in Great Falls. His neighbors, he
says, have had mixed response to the
publicity about him. ”Mostly people
seem to wonder why we would take
part in an operation like that.” Recent-
ly, NAFA revoked McPartlin’s mem-
bership, claiming he misrepresented
his violation of wildlife law when he
joined the organization in 1977 and
that his capture of birds in Operation
Falcon was unethical. ”I wish they’d
have taken a different stand,” Mc-
Partlin says. ”It would have been very
good for the birds.” A

IN 1955, a San Diego commercial'ﬁsher-
man named Chuck Chamberlain had an
idea. Fishing that year had been poor, and
Chamberlain’s bank account was thread-
bare How, he Wendered, could he earn
some badly needed money?

Chamberlain’s solution was to hand-
letter a sign on a piece of cardboard and
post it on a dock in San Diego Bay next to
his battered ﬁshing trawler, the Old Iron-
side. The sign read: “See the Whales.
Only One Dollar.”

Arctic. Each led by a naturalist, these
whale-watching trips last up to nine or 11
days, can cost from $610 to $1,170 (21/2-
hour day cruises average about $8.50),
and appear as enthusiastically booked by
camera—toting amateur naturalists today
as were the 19th-century whalers with
their cannon, harpoons and line.

Animal migration is a phenomenon in
nature that has long fascinated scientists,
and the distance traveled by some species
is astounding. The North American mon—
arch butterﬂy, for instance, is known to
ﬂy up to 2,000 round-trip miles each
year. One species of tern soars halfway
around the world to ﬁnd food, to escape
bad weather or predators, or to breed and
hatch its young. The migration of the
salmon is well known, but that journey of
course occurs only once, from its original
spawning ground to the open sea and back
to the spawning ground, where it lays its
eggs and then dies.

Of all nature’s wanderers, however, the
California gray whale holds the record on
several counts. In terms of distance, its
odyssey is the longest known migration of
any mammal. And of the several species
of cetaceans, only the gray whale travels
in such shallow water so close to shore
and with such predictable regularity that
it can be anticipated with considerable
accuracy.

At times, the gray whale travels just be-
yond the surf line in its southward jour-
ney, navigating instinctively past coastal
obstacles and hazards with almost un-
canny intelligence, if indeed the word
“intelligence” can be applied to any crea-
ture that is not human, lacking the ability
to reason.

Because of the great distance the gray
whale travels, in fact, it spends nearly
half its life on the run, moving between
the Arctic and Mexico.

Termed “living relics” by one scientist
because they are at the extreme, primitive
end of cetacean evolution, ,Califomia gray
whales reach a length of 35 to 45 feet and
weigh up to 20 tons at maturity. Even
newborn calves are huge—12 to 17 feet
long and 1,000 to 3,000 pounds at birth,
adding as much as 25 pounds and an inch
of length to their bodies each day.

Chaperoned by fiercely protective
mothers after they are born in warm Mex-
ican waters, the young whales are nursed
while they learn to feed for themselves
during their ﬁrst journey back to the Arc-
tic. They grow to about 30 feet before
beginning their own first southward
migration the following October.

Onetime terrestrial mammals that en—
tered the sea about 30,000,000 years ago,
gray whales are baleen cetaceans. That is,
instead of having teeth they subsist on
small crustaceans (shrimp-like animals)

called amphipods that they ingest through \

huge, matlike baleen strainers in their
mouths. The baleen is not made of bone
as it appears to be, but of a hom-like sub-
stance similar to human ﬁngernails.

Colored slate gray, heavily mottled and
usually seen with barnacle scars, gray
whales live an average of 30 to 40 years
(though some have been known to live
60 years), and their only known preda-
tors are killer whales, large sharks . ..
and man.

AS MIGHT BE imagined, it was the gray
whale’s apparent indifference to dangers
on shore that almost led to its extinction
when San Diego was still a sleepy hamlet
a century ago. Gray whales have been
hunted by man for thousands of years.
Eskimos in Alaska and Siberia pursued
them in canoes and killed them with
hand-thrown harpoons made of ivory,
tipped with barbs made of stone.

But this was mere subsistence hunting;
the aboriginal predators took only the
numbers they needed for food. Their
whale harvest had little to do with the spe-
cies’ plummet toward oblivion that began
in the mid—19th century with the advent
of commercial whaling on a large scale.

In 1846 Whalers discovered that gray
whales wintered in protected lagoons
of the West Coast of Baja California, and
that their easily predictable migratory
routes from the Arctic placed them al-
most constantly in sight of the shoreline.
No longer did whaling require tedious
and sometimes dangerous weeks at
sea, watching for the telltale blowhole
spouts of water that marked the whales’
presence.

For the next half century, shore whal-
ing mushroomed all along the West Coast
of both Califomias. Eleven whaling sta-
tions were established in Alta California
alone, two of them in San Diego Bay near
Ballast Point. Migrating whales could
easily be spotted from atop Point Loma,
where whaling boats would be directed to
their quarry by a series of ﬂag signals.
Once killed by harpoon and tied along—
side the whaling boats, the mammals
were then towed to Ballast Point for proc-
essing.

Each whale yielded between 25 and 45
barrels of oil that in 1855 sold for $27 to
$40 a barrel. That meant a proﬁt of up to

SAN DIEGO MAGAZINE - FEBRUARY 1986

$1,800 from each whale—a tidy sum in
the booming post-Gold Rush days of
early California.

It was in 1857 that Captain Charles M.
Scammon discovered the Baja California
lagoon that now bears his name, and
Scammon’s Lagoon was then as now one
of the most popular wintering grounds for
the migrant grays.

Between the hunting in Baja California
and that conducted from Alta California
stations like the two in San Diego, the
gray whale’s population declined in the 40
years until the end of the century from
about 30,000 animals to a point that hunt—
ing these great animals was no longer
proﬁtable because of their scarcity. To the
salvation of Eschrichtius robustus, whal-
ers turned to other, more abundant spe-
cies, allowing the gray whale a slight
breathing spell before the invention of the
harpoon gun and other modern weapons
made hunting the elusive gray economi-
cally attractive once again.

By that time, however, enough senti-
ment had been generated internationally
to control whaling under terms of the In-
ternational Agreement for the Regulation
of Whaling, signed in 1937. Japan and the
Soviet Union were not signatories to this
pact, and they continued to hunt gray
whales. However, in 1946 they joined 15
other nations in a second agreement, the
International Convention for the Regula-
tion of Whaling, which prohibited the
killing of gray whales. That agreement
also established the International Whal—
ing Commission (IWC), whose ﬁrst act
was to grant complete protection to the
gray whale and several other species of
cetaceans except for a small number allo—
cated to aboriginal hunting by Siberian
and Alaskan Eskimos.

Its population reduced to only a few
thousand individuals—too few, many sci-
entists worried at the time, to recover as a
species—the gray whale nevertheless did
make a comeback. It was granted further
protection by the United States in 1969
with adoption of the Endangered Species
Conservation Act, in 1972 by the Marine
Mammal Protection Act and a year later
by the Endangered Species Act.

Under these mandates, still in effect, it
is illegal to “. .. harass, harm, pursue,
hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or
collect, or attempt to engage in any such
conduct” with regard to any endangered
marine mammal species “within the ter-
ritorial seas of the United States or on the
high seas.”

Since the ﬁrst protective act became

GRAY WHALES

 

law in 1937, the California gray whale
population has increased from a compar-
ative handful to an estimated 15,000 to
20,000 animals. No one knows for cer—
tain exactly how many there are now
because, unlike terrestrial animals in a
clearly deﬁned, easily observable habi-
tat, marine mammal nose-counting is at
best a matter of scientific guesswork.
Most professionals, however, agree on
the 15,000 to 20,000 ﬁgure. Further, it is
estimated that the population is increas-
ing at a rate of about 2.5 percent annually.

So remarkable has this recovery been,
in fact, that the federal government has
announced it will recommend the Cali-
fornia gray whale be removed from its
“endangered” list altogether, and be
downgraded to the category of “threat-

ened.” This doesn’t mean that, legally, '

the gray whale will become fair game for
whalers once again. Government ofﬁcials
insist the change involves merely a down-
grading of classiﬁcation to one requiring
fewer government protections for the’spe—
cies, not an invitation for its killing since
it would still be shielded by the 1972 Ma-
rine Mammal Protective Act, which regu-
lates the commercial use of all marine
mammals, whales or otherwise.

Despite the ﬁne-line drawing and the
semantics, many conservationists are
concerned and vocally nervous over the
proposal. Thus, as the 1985—86 whale-
watching season reaches its peak this
month, the California gray whale ﬁnds

itself in the limelight as possibly never
before.

What is especially significant about
the “de-listing” proposal is that, except
when an animal has become extinct, it has
never happened before in the case of a
marine mammal. “We’ve removed ani-
mals from the endangered list because
they’ve disappeared,” says James H.
Lecky, a wildlife biologist with N MFS in
Los Angeles, “but never because they’ve
recovered.” Rather than being a cause
for alarm, Lecky feels in the case of the
gray whale, “this is probably a cause for
celebration.”

Not all whale protectionists agree.
Some worry that without endangered sta-
tus the gray whale will again be hunted,
legally or not, while other, non-hunting
dangers to its existence may fade from
public attention. They argue, too, that
downgrading could affect seven other
types of whales currently on the endan-
gered list. Says Alan Reichman, a spokes-
man for the Seattle-based Greenpeace
conservation organization: “De-listing
could mean less resolve on the part of
government agencies now protecting the
whale. It could be very detrimental to the
species.”

Others fear that, though they now are
signatories to international whale-
protection agreements, Japan and the So-
viet Union might read the downgrading as
a signal that they could stalk the gray
whale once again without fear of reprisals

or sanctions.

Downgrading from one list to another
is not automatic. First, NMF S must pub-
lish its intention to do so in the Federal
Register. That’s required by federal law.
Next come required public hearings and a
decision, probably later this year. Law-
suits by dissenters to the NMFS decision
could delay implementation even longer.

Reﬂecting growing interest in the g0v-
ernment’s proposal, petitions opposing
the downgrading are currently being cir—
culated in several states, and “save the
gray whale” programs have moved up an-
other notch on priority agendas of several
conservation organizations.

IN SAN DIEGO, historically a major
center for cetacean research, reaction to
the downgrading'proposal is mixed,
though it seems to be less negative than in
some other areas.

Dr. William E. Evans, director of the
Hubbs Research Institute at Sea World,
sees no reason why the gray whale should
not be removed from the “endangered”
category. “In terms of population num-
bers,” he says, “the animal technically is
not endangered anymore, so why keep it
on that list? And the list itself doesn’t do
what a lot of people think it does; it’s a
political designation more than a biologi—
cal one.”

What concerns Evans more than any
downgrading or upgrading are many fac-
tors other than hunting that can adversely

 




 

 

GRAY WHALES

 

 

 

 

affect the gray whale’s future. “The main
problem facing the gray whale, as with
many other animals, is loss of habitat,” he
explains. “More and more, there is com-
petition for its food supply. Development
along the coast, increased boating activ-
ity along its migratory route—these are
only a few of the inﬂuences on its future.”

It was Evans, at that time a civilian sci-
entist working for the Navy, who in 1972
led a research team that released a Cali-
fornia gray whale named Gigi into the
open sea after a period of captivity at Sea
World. Gigi, captured in Scammon’s La-
goon shortly after birth, became nearly
as celebrated as Melville’s Moby Dick,
the ﬁrst of her species ever to be held in
captivity.

Evans and fellow scientists compiled
considerable data on gray whales as a
result of Gigi’s two years in the public
eye. This research, he insists, would have
been nearly impossible to obtain in the
wild. Still, he admits, there is a lot yet to
be learned about gray'whales in particular
and cetaceans in general, even though sci-
ence has zeroed in on these magniﬁcent
marine creatures for many decades.

“For instance, although we are cur—
rently concerned over what effect off-
shore oil drilling may have on the gray
whale migration, we still don’t have
all the answers,” he says. He points to
research conducted in this area several
years ago by the late Dr. Raymond
Gilmore, who at the time was associated
with the San Diego Museum of Natural
History. _

“What"Ray found out,” says Evans, “is
that when confronted with underwater
seismic explosions used in oil explora—
tion, gray whales seem to do whatever
you see them doing at the moment. Some
swim quickly away from the explosions.
Others do nothing. Still others, appar-
ently curious, swim toward the source of
the noise. That happens with a lot of ani-

 

mals. I know because I raise goats and I
tried the same thing with a ﬁrecracker.”

Although Evans feels downgrading the
gray whale will not encourage their kill-
ing on a large scale (“Absolutely not,” he
says), he feels as strongly that the species
must have some kind of protection—no
less than “threatened,” at least—to call
attention to the other, non-hunting inﬂu—
ences on its future.

“Humphrey taught us a lot,” Evans
says, referring to the celebrated hump-
back whale that entered San Francisco
Bay last fall and wandered for weeks the
“wrong way” upriver toward Sacramento
before finally gaining its bearings and
finding the Pacific Ocean again. “A
century or so ago, Humphrey probably
would not have had that problem. But that
was before bridges, people and boats
were all over the bay. The pressures on the
gray whale are as enormous.”

Stressing that her views are personal
and not necessarily those of the American
Cetacean Society, of whose San Diego
County chapter she is vice-president,
Susan Bradley of Ramona, like Evans,
sees no danger in downgrading the gray.
“The ‘endangered list,’ ” she says,
“should be reserved for animals that
really are endangered. Leaving animals
on the list that are not only tends to dilute
the effectiveness of the list itself.”

Nationally, it should be pointed out, the
2,000—member society met last Septem—
ber to discuss the proposed downgrading,
and in a press conference that followed
Society President Joanne Smalley called
the idea “risky.”

“Even though the [gray whale] stock is
very healthy at this point,” she said, “that
can change quickly under environmental
pressure.” The society currently is debat-
ing what position it will take at the down—
grading hearings later this year.

As the debate in their behalf swirls, the
gray whales continue to swim past San

 

Diego hour by hour, day by day, in what
Dr. Theodore J. Walker, a San Diego zo—
ologist and gray whale expert, once called
“the greatest animal show on earth.”
Thousands of their human friends here
will have watched them pass by before the
last straggler wanders north late this
spring en route to another Arctic summer.

One of the most intensely interested ob—
servers this year is the Cetacean Society’s
Susan Bradley. Since early December,
Bradley and fellow society volunteers
have been manning a special whale-watch
post on San Clemente Island. Assisted lo—
gistically by the US Navy, which oper—
ates the island as a gunnery range, they
are gathering yet more evidence of gray
whale migration patterns, both southward
and northward. These patterns change
from year to year.

As Keith K. Howell, former vice-
president of The Oceanic Society, points
out in a foreword to the society’s Field
Guide to the Gray Whale. the changing
behavior of whales “is just one reason
why so many descriptions in this book are
qualiﬁed with an ‘often,’ a ‘probably,’ or
an ‘it seems.’ Much of our information
[about gray whales] is recent, and many
hypotheses remain to be tested.”

So it is with details of the gray whale’s
migratory track. Seeking answers, Brad-
ley may at this very moment be huddled
against the cold on a windswept San Cle-
mente Island hilltop, binoculars in hand.

And it is perhaps ironic, as Howell also
notes, that the animal we now pursue so
relentlessly in the name of science is the
same one we nearly eliminated from na-
ture’s registry less than a century ago.

“As more and more people whale-
watch and come to appreciate not only the
beauty of whales but those qualities that
transcend the traditional boundaries that
separate us,” Howell concludes, “whales
will become inﬁnitely more valuable to us
alive than they ever were dead.” I

 




 




of the controversy, so they decided to just
chuck the program.”

“I’m distressed that they’re [Audubon]
holding up the trapping of the birds and
running the risk that more of them will die,”
counters Warren Thomas, director of the
Los Angeles Zoo, which houses 11 con-
dors. “To stop trapping them is totally in-
sensitive. It’s like the Audubon Society is
saying, ‘If we don’t get our way, then the
birds are expendable.’ ”

Audubon ’s primary objection to the cap-
ture program is that without some “guide”
condors left in the wild to show the way,
the condors in captivity will never be able
to return to their natural habitat. '

“What we’re talking about is a trade-
off,” says Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the
San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park.
“Look at the mortality rate. If we left them
out there another year or so, they might all
die off on their own. Then we wouldn’t
have any anyway.”

Wildlife service biologists also believe
the birds may have developed some bad
habits that put them in danger, such as
straying too near heavily populated areas or
building nests on unsafe sites, and that they
might drop those habits if they’re removed
from the wild for a time.

he high likelihood is that they’ll die;
the Fish and Wildlife Service is

right about that. But it seems worth
taking a risk to me,” Butcher says. “The
birds that will eventually be released will
need cultural knowledge to survive out
there, and I don’t think there’s any way to
get that knowledge other than from wild
birds.”

The Audubon Society and its supporters
also charge that, with no condors left in the
wild, legislators will ﬁnd it hard to resist
the pressures of developers seeking to build
on the valuable tract of land, known as the
Hudson Ranch, that the condors tradition-
ally have used as a prime foraging area.

“There’s a lot of pressure on President
Reagan to buy the land out there [and set
it aside as a refuge], but Reagan doesn’t
want to spend the money,” Butcher says. “If
there are no condors on it, there will be no
reason for the administration to buy it. And
other people want to develop the land. If
it’s developed, it won’t be there for the
condors, and there will be no place for them
to be put back. So removing ti.» birds is
potentially a ﬁnal step.”

There is also, some of the naturalists
say, another force working to the detriment
of the birds.

“Part of the pressure [to bring all the

Audubons Amos Eno: Critic of “caprrocius”U.S. Fish d Wildlife Service ' "

birds in] comes from the LA. Zoo. The
San Diego Zoo is a model of cooperation
and a ﬁrst-rate facility, but the LA. Zoo is
neither,” says Eno. “The object of the con-
dor program is the preservation of the spe-
cies in the wild. And the zoos are not
responsible for the preservation of the birds
in the wild. They have no data pertaining
to that. For the sake of adding a few birds
to their collection, they want to endanger
the whole species.”

“I’ve heard nothing more ludicrous, and
I take great exception to it,” replies
Thomas. “The birds aren’t even on display.
They’re totally isolated, and the public
can’t get in to see them ever. It would be
quite an ego trip for us to spend as much
time and money as we do on an exhibit that
nobody ever sees.”

Eno also claims the LA. Zoo purposely
“screwed up the handling” of its condors
so that none could be released on schedule
this year. “That’s not true at all,” Thomas
counters. “The release program was reeval-
uated after so many condors died in the
wild last winter. It is still going to happen,
but not as soon as we all hoped. We can’t
release the birds until we can guarantee, as
best we can, their survival.”

“The only goal should be maintaining ,

the condors in the wild,” Butcher says. “If
they live only in zoos, then they do not
live.”

The battle was scheduled to resume in
court Jan. 27. But while the two sides
remain staunchly divided, few on either
side disagree that the govemment’s six-
year, $6 million condor preservation pro-
gram has provided scientists with rich and
valuable insights into the habits and behav-
ior of these rare vultures.

“We’ve learned a lot about their phys-
iology and basic biology,” says Klinger,
“and we’ve seen the phenomenon of dou-
ble-clutching,” in which scientists remove
the egg from the nest early enough so that
the breeding pair will produce a second egg
that same season. “We’ve also learned that
the birds can be raised in captivity, and
we’ve developed capture and feeding tech-
niques that minimize human contact with
the birds, so they won’t get too used to
humans before they’re released.”

For now, though, the future of the
brawny birds appears to rest in the breeding
programs at the Los Angeles and San Di-
ego zoos. Scientists have had good success
hatching condor eggs stolen from nests in
the wild, but, so far, no condors have pro-
duced eggs in captivity. Some environmen-
talists say the birds never will, but those
involved in the breeding programs say no
eggs have been laid because, until last year,
neither zoo had an adult breeding pair.

Condors don’t reach sexual maturity un-
til around the age of 7 years. And even
then, they select their mates only after com-
pleting a ritual known as pairing. Maturing
condors have paired at both zoos now, and
biologists expect them to reproduce.

“We expect them to do very well in
captivity. Andean condors [which also are
endangered but number close to 3,000]
breed readily in captivity,” says Jouett.
“There may be a period of adjustment nec-
essary, though. We hope to get our ﬁrst
eggs this spring, but it may be in 1987. We
should have a good number reproducing in
captivity by 1990, so that would give us a
good number of potential candidates to re-
lease between, say, 1992 and 2002’

Meanwhile, Arthur Risser, the curator
of birds at the San Diego Zoo, has sug-
gested that a dozen Andean condors be
tagged and released in California so scien-
tists could observe how they adapt to the
habitat. Such research, he says, could pro-
vide valuable assistance in helping the re-
leased California condors adapt to the wild.
Some scientists also believe turkey vultures
and the Andean condors might make suit-
able guide birds for the California condors.

Even if the breeding programs ﬂourish
and the condors successfully reclaim their
place in the wild —— and those ends are by
no means guaranteed — the ﬁght over the
birds will color indeﬁnitely the relationship
between the Fish and Wildlife Service and
the nation’s major environmentalist groups.

Everyone involved in the fracas agrees
that the bottom line is the viability of the
species. But no matter which way the court
battle goes, the question of how best to save
the condors probably will be debated for
years to come.

Feathers Fly over Vanishing Condor

SUMMARY: As California condors
approach extinction, the U.$. Fish
and Wildlife Service wants to
capture the few remaining in the
wild to protect them and boost
their breeding. Environmentalists
have sued to stop the agency,
fearing the plan could end in the
loss of the condors’ habitat and
their ability to live in the wild.

any years ago, the skies over the

American West were thick with

California condors, the largest

ﬂying birds in the world. On strong, broad

wings spanning almost 10 feet, the huge

vultures —— some weighing up to 30 pounds

— ranged as far north as Washington, as

far south as Baja California, as far east as
Texas.

Now, though, the big, open Western

skies are virtually empty of condors. There
were a dozen in the wild as recently as
1984, but half died in less than a year. One
tangled with a power line; another died
from eating a lead pellet in a carcass. The
others — which scientists believe also may
have had lead poisoning — just disap—
peared, leaving only six to soar high over
their only remaining sanctuary, in the foot-
hills and mountains at the southern end of
the San Joaquin Valley. To omithologists,
the most frightening aspect of this precipi-
tous population decline was that it left but
one breeding pair in the wild. Because
condors generally lay only a single egg
every other year, it appeared their ﬁnal days
were at hand.

Alarmed by this dramatic turn toward
disaster, the US. Fish and Wildlife Service
late last year decided to undertake a desper-
ate and highly controversial effort to save

the endangered species. Working through
its Condor Research Center in Ventura,
Calif, the government sent biologists to
trap the last six wild birds and secure them
at the Los Angeles Zoo and the San Diego
Zoo and Wild Animal Park. Between them
the two zoos house 21 California condors,
the only ones left other than those few still
in the wild.

In December “we reluctantly recom—
mended —— and I stress reluctantly —— that
we bring them all in, at least for the short
term,” says David Klinger, a Fish and Wild-
life Service spokesman.

“We had planned to bring three in, leave
three out there and then release three more
[this] April,” Klinger says. “But given the
recent developments, we just felt we had to
move, and move fast.”

The decision to corral the remaining
free birds brought sharp criticism from
such nature groups as the National Au-
dubon Society, Friends of the Earth and the
Sierra Club, which believe they should be
left in the wild. After the scientists trapped
a female condor weak from lead poisoning
Jan. 3 (she died Jan. 19 at the San Diego
Zoo after emergency surgery to clear her
digestive tract failed), the Audubon Society
filed suit to stop the roundup. On Jan. 9, a
federal judge issued a restraining order pro-
hibiting the wildlife service from capturing
more condors until the debate can be settled
in court -— a legal action that brought the
simmering controversy to a boil.

Environmental controversies are hardly
new, but this one is unusual in that it does
not pit naturalists against developers, but
rather two factions of environmentalists
against each other, each trying to reach the
same end through very different means.
The Audubon Society has exacerbated the
bitter confrontation by charging some of its
opponents with mismanaging the condor
programs and others with meddling.

“When people believe passionately in
something, they often are willing to go to
great lengths to resolve it,” says Greg
Butcher, director of research at Cornell
University’s Laboratory of Ornithology.
“In a situation like this, where hope has
deteriorated rapidly, I think you’ve got peo-
ple acting out of despair.”

“The wildlife service’s decision [to cap-
ture the remaining birds] was arbitrary and
capricious. There was no consideration of
the ramiﬁcations,” says Amos Eno, direc-
tor of wildlife programs for the Audubon
Society. “They’re giving in to short-term
political pressures. They were getting tired

AL TRUJILLO, the La Junta-based dis-
trict wildlife manager for Crowley and
Otero counties, said the two rehabilita-
tors in the area “are like extra pe0ple on
the staff.”

Carole Trout and Mark Korbitz, the re-
habilitators, are “extremely dedicated to _ .
wildlife. They love what they’re doing.
Without them, I’d be handling a lot of those;
calls and I think my workload already is i
a heavy and hectic one.” -

Ruch said the state “is receiving some
very valuable services from these volun-
teers. Quite frankly, I don’t think the
state could afford to care for these animals
otherwise.”

But his question is whether all injured
birds and animals deserve care.

Ruch puts the wildlife in two catego—
ries: ..

First, those, such as falcons and eagles, -
that are protected because of concern for
the existence of the species. ;

Second, the individual animal found
caught in a trap, burned by a power line or
injured at the side of the road.

’ “One barn owl more or less doesn’t

make any difference,” Ruch said. “But, be-
cause peeple are sympathetic when they

see a little white fuzzy fluffball on the
ground under a tree, they pick up that lit-
tle critter when they should leave him
alone.” '

As urban and rural Colorado continue
to collide, the wildlife division “could al- ‘
ways use more people to help us,” Ruch
said.

“But a lot of people lose interest when
they understand how hard it is to get a li-
cense and how much work it is. This is.
not an area where we want part-timers or
people who think it’s just fun. It’s not just
going out and loving animals.”

licensed by the state wildlife division to care for injured birds and animals.

Their spirits soar like eagles
when the injured they heal take flight

 

By JOE GARNER
Rocky Mountain News Staff Writer

 

Sigrid Ueblacker sees a miracle when a
bird takes flight after she has nursed it
back to health.

“I don’t cry, but I get very excited and

very nervous,” she said. “It’s a good feeling ‘

to see a bird fly again, a wonderful feel-
mg.”

As shepping centers grow up where
there used to be fields and forests, birds and
animals are the casualties. Ueblacker is
among 40 volunteers working for the C010-
rado Division of Wildlife who nurse them
back to health and release them into the
wilderness.

“There are hundreds of maple in Colo-
rado who want to take care of wild ani-
mals,” said Jim Ruch, wildlife division
director. “But there are only a handful who
can take care of them without making
them worse. They are the ones we want.”

THE DIVISION licenses those who
meet its standards to care for injured wild-
life. The US Fish & Wildlife Service also
requires permits for a person to keep some
wildlife.

Of the 40 peeple licensed by the wild
life division, 24 are in the Denver area, said
Rae Medlin, the division rehabilitation
secretary. Only five new licenses were is-
sued last year, although some applicants
who didn’t qualify for a license volunteer
their time for those who did.

Ueblacker cares for raptors — eagles,
falcons, owls and other magnificent birds of
prey. Others specialize only in game,
small mammals or waterfowl.

Her philoSOphy of care is the one advo-
cated by the wildlife division: “I try to
keep them as wild as I can. I handle them
only if I have to When I know they’re
well and capable of taking care of them-
selves, I always release them where they
came from.”

The last golden eagle she released was
set free Jan. 11 near Colorado Springs after
five weeks in her care.

The bird, brought in with no apparent
injury, “was extremely quiet, lethargic,”
Ueblacker said. Such injuries sometimes
are the result of flying into a power line or
being brushed by a car.

After 10 days of quiet care, she put the
bird in a flight cage, but it only sat on the
low perches.

Slowly it regained its strength, and on
Jan. 1 she found it on one of the high
perches. \

“He was extremely anxious to leave
before I let him go,” she said. “I even vid-
eotaped him when I let him go. He was so
beautiful the way he flew.”

Not all the injured birds can be re-
turned to the wild. Those that regain their
health but cannot fend for themselves in
nature remain in her care. Others are euth-
anized. -

Ueblacker said she spends up to $5,000
a year caring for the birds, with as many as
80 in cages at her Lakewood home and a
Boulder County farm in the summer.

“It’s not the noise,” she said. “It’s the
work. You have to get up at 6 in the morn-
ing and begin to chap up mice to feed I

them.”

In addition to obtaining three levels of
wildlife division endorsement to qualify for
a license, an applicant must have the as—
sistance of a veterinarian willing to care for
the animals at no cost to the state.

Guaranteeing free care never has been
an issue, said Dr. George Dewell, a Carbon-
dale veterinarian who is president of the
Colorado Veterinary Medical Association.

“We realize it’s a humane thing to do,
and we’re helping the Division of Wildlife
salvage some animals that they might not
have the funds to care for,” Dewell said.

Dr. Michael Brooks of Granby is one of
a handful of wildlife division licensees who
is a veterinarian.

The typical cost of treating a bird
brought to the Granby Veterinary Clinic is
$100, although the donated services for a
severely injured bird may run to $400,
Brooks said. He cares for one bird every
four to six weeks.

“The goal is to help the wildlife,” he
said. “The more cases you see, the better
equipped you are to help others down the
road)’

Statewide, the volunteers, whom the
wildlife division calls “rehabilitators,”
cared for $57 birds and 73 animals in
1984. That’s up from 197 birds and 35 ani-
mals in 1982, the first year for which fig-
ures are available.

San Anselmo trainer Helen Bodington, with her Canolo, showed how easy it is to lead a llama in and out of a van

North Bay Breeding Ranches

 

By George Snyder

Llama breeding has become a small
booming business in North Bay coun-
ties, where the creatures are used as
pets, pack animals and pasture mowers.

., “There are at least six llama ranches be
tween here and Santa Rosa,” said San Ansei~
mo llama trainer Helen Bodington, “and the
number of llamas is increasing all the time.”

. In Marin and Sonoma counties alone
there are an estimated 400 of the creatures,
which bring asmuch as a $1000 for a male and
up to $10,000 for a baby female.

The curious, sloe-eyed camelids, a family
that includes South American vicunas, alo
pacas, guanacos and the old world camel,
were used by ancient Incas as beasts of bur~
den.

_ These days, they may be seen in herds of
30 or 40 animals in Marin and Sonoma, where
they are raised to be used as pack animals by
backpackers or as a chic alternative to sheep
and donkeys as pasture animals. Other llamas
are domestic pets, and still others are valued

.\,_
w

for their thick wool.

“The numbers are growing all the time ”
said Cotati veterinarian Lee Matern. “It’s be
come a boom.”

“A good quality baby female llama is
worth $10,000,".he said. “it's Only the males

that people are using as pets or for carrying .

packs on trails. The females are all busy being
bred by ranchers. You have a hard time find
ing an adult female to buy.”

Trainer Bodington estimates that there
are 9000 of the animals in the entire United
States, with Montana, Oregon and Northern
California as the areas where North Ameri-
can llama-raising got its unpublicized start
about 10 years ago. '

Bodington, who has owned a llama for
three years, offers a $200training course last-
ing from three to four weeks to'llama owners
who keep the animals for domestic purposes.

“1 train them to wear a halter, to kneel, to
stand to be brushed and to be loaded into a
van willingly, among other things," she said.

Otherwise it takes three people, she said,

 

to wrestle an untrained llama into a van.

Veterinarian Matern said most llamas in
the US. came from a single pair imported
years ago from South America.

“The industry is afraid to import more
from South America because of the lack of
control of disease down there. What they are
deathly afraid of is some guy getting cheap

but sick llamas and flooding the market

here.”

Although the animals are generally very
hardy, vets are beginning to observe some
problems, such as a predisposition for females
to abort twins.

“It’s all so new,” he said, “we’re just learn-

ing‘about them."

Matern added that he is in the market for
a llama himself.

“They make nice pets,” he said, “and be.
sides, it wouldn't hurt to be around an animal
l’m supposed to know something about.”

A best friend gets new life

OSU vets succeed in one of first kidney transplants in dog

By KAREN FARKAS
STAFF WRITER

Oden is not your average kidney
transplant patient.

He is a dog, a mixed breed, 1%
years old and doing well two weeks

 

after the surgery at Ohio State Uni— .

versity’s Veterinary Hospital.He is
also one of the first dogs in the United
States to receive such a life-saving
transplant.

Doctors say they hope Oden will
soon be able to return to his owner,
Martha Johnson, of Gambier, 0.

It all started when Oden apparently
licked some antifreeze, which con-
tains ethylene glycol, a chemical toxic
to kidney cells.

“ Johnson noticed last October that
Oden was depressed and vomiting. She
said her veterinarian suggested he be
sent to the OSU Veterinary Hospital
when he did not respond to treatment
for what was thought to be an intesti-
"nal‘infection.

At OSU, tests showed the dog had
swallowed antifreeze, which usually
kills animals. Oden was placed in
intensive care and put on dialysis Nov.
6. He received treatments eight times
every 24 hours.

When his kidneys did not begin
working again on their own, doctors
decided to try a kidney transplant,
said Robert Sherding, head of small
animal medicine at the hospital.
Although transplants have been per-
formed on dogs to aid in human trans-

plant research, the procedure has
rarely been done to save a dog’s life.

Sherding said OSU veterinarians
had been studying kidney diseases and
were collecting information to start a
kidney transplant program for ani-
mals.

Oden was the perfect first candi-
date.

“He was a young dog and a normal
dog, and he was handling dialysis and
doing better than any other dog who
has been on it,” he said.

In addition, the dog, a mix of collie

- and Labrador retriever, had endeared

himself to the staff and students at
OSU. Sherding said Oden knew the
technicians and got excited when they
arrived at work. The dog, with long,
black hair with gold flecks, performs
tricks, including balancing a doughnut
on his nose, throwing it in the air and
catching it. One staffer had buttons
made with Oden’s name on them.

“He has become a beloved animal,”
Sherding said. “He is the kind of dog
with a lot of spirit and heart. People
have asked why we have tried so hard
on this case, but he is just that kind of
animal.”

Sherding said a couple of obstacles
had to be overcome before the trans-
plant could be done. _

First they needed a donor.

“I asked the owner if she knew
where any of his litter mates were,
and she said she knew his sister lived
nearby,” Sherding said.

Johnson said Oden’s sister still lived
with the family who had given her
Oden when he was a puppy. Oden and
Mary Lou attended obedience school
together, she said.

The family agreed to let Mary Lou
donate a kidney.

“They have a number of dogs and
realized how much Oden meant to
me," Johnson said. “Also, it is not rou-
tine surgery, but it is not something
that really endangered her life.”

Doctors tested tissue samples and
gave Oden blood transfusions from
Mary Lou to decrease the chance of
organ rejection. A Special anti-rejec-
tion drug was ordered from Minne-
sota.

Next they needed a doctor.

Sherding said he contacted doctors
at OSU Hospitals about the transplant
and they agreed to assist the veteri-
narians. Dr. Mitchell Henry, a widely
known surgeon in the hospital’s
human transplant program, per-
formed the surgery, he said. Henry
had performed several experimental
kidney transplants in dogs.

About 30 professionals watched the
surgery Jan. 13, which was video-
taped, Sherding said.

Mary Lou recovered and is at home.
Oden is doing well, Sherding said. .

Johnson said Oden was active, and

when she visited last Monday they,

shared a hamburger and French fries.

Sherding said he h0ped to be able to
offer such transplants in the future.
The most prohibitive item may be the
cost.

Oden’s transplant and other treat-
ment has cost more than $8,000. John-
son, who works in the Kenyon College
bookstore, cannot pay all costs, so the
OSU veterinary school is accepting
donations.

OSU will absorb some costs because
of the knowledge gained from the
transplant.

Johnson said she made the three-
hour round trip about once a week to
visit Oden until he had his transplant.
Now she tries to visit two to four
times a week.

“I am very pleased,” she said about

his survival. “1 never expected'he

would need a transplant, although it
was mentioned as a possibility in the
beginning.” ~

Kenyon students are kept up to date
on Oden’s progress, and Johnson said
she was glad he was alive, regardless
of the cost.

“He is worth it,” she said. “He has
been fighting so hard through the
whole thing, and I was not going to say
‘Sorry, guy, it is over, I am not going
to pay for it.’

“PeOple who have pets understand.”

Royal First Dog at the White House

SUMMARY: Nancy Reagan’s new
pet may look like a sweet, spotted
iapdog, but don’t underestimate
new ﬁrst dog Rex: The Cavalier
King Charles Spaniel has a long
history of playing conﬁdant to
royalty and heads of state. So
beloved of one English monarch
that they were granted privileges
under British law, these feisty
little spaniels have a very
impressive pedigree Indeed.

harles and Di are not the only Eng-

lish royalty to come to the White

House in recent months. The Rea-

gans have welcomed into their home an

Englishman with an even more impressive
pedigree — the ﬁrst dog, Rex.

Rex is a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel,
one of a rare and royal breed popular in the
English court for some 400 years. Though
most spaniel breeds are bird dogs — they
retrieve game for their owners without
mangling the birds or running off under a
bush and having them for dinner — the
Cavalier is a small dog and prefers to hunt
under the dining room table. The Cavalier’s
job for the past six centuries has been to be
a companion and comfort to his owner.
Standing 12 to 14 inches high at the
shoulder and weighing 15 to 20 pounds, it
is large enough for an adult to take for a
walk without looking ridiculous and small
enough to be out of the way in a house or
car or, originally, a carriage.

A toy spaniel very like Rex ﬁgures in a
15th century tapestry called “The Offering
of the Heart.” One of them romps in Ti-
tian’s famous portrait of the Duchess of
Urbino, painted in the early 1500s. The
artist used the shade of red which is his
trademark, and Rex Reagan’s red-and-
white color remains the most popular color
of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, though
they also come in black and white with tan
accents (tricolor), solid chestnut (ruby) and
black and tan.

In England’s Wobum Abbey hangs a
portrait painted in 1554 by Antonio Moro
of Queen Mary (“Bloody Mary”) and her
husband, Philip of Spain, with a pair of
these spaniels, symbolic of ﬁdelity, at their
feet. Mary Queen of Scots, in 1563, seems
to have held her spaniel 1n the sleeve of her
dress to comfort her at her beheading.
Afterward, in the ofﬁcial account, when
the executioners began to strip her corpse,
they‘ espied her little dogg which was crept
under her clothes which could not be gotten
forth but by force, yet afterwards would not
departe from the dead corpse, but came and

lay between her head and her shoulders.”

The young Queen Victoria sat for a
number of portraits with her tricolor Cava-
lier, Dash. Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Sir
Peter Lely and scores of other artists
painted portraits not only of royalty but of
middle-class and literary ﬁgures with their
Cavalier pets. One of these spaniels, called
Rogue, walked with Charles Ito his execu-
tion in Whitehall in 1649. But it was from
Charles H (of England that the modern
breed adopted its name. Charles H kept
them about him in large numbers, prompt-
ing Samuel Pepys to grumble in his diary,
“All I observed was the silliness of the King
playing with his dogs all the while and not
minding the business.”

It is said that Charles H had statutes
passed allowing these spaniels to enter any
law court and to travel free on any public
transport in the realm. John Evelyn wrote
that the king “took delight in having a
number of little spaniels follow him and lie
in his bedcharnber . . . which made it nasty
and stinking.” The Cavaliers’ reign at the
British court ended with James H.

While former ﬁrst dog Lucky is ru-
mored to have been the victim of a political
power play, muscled out of the White
House by the same high-ranking pres-
idential aide who is said to have done in
National Security Adviser Robert McFar-
lane, it is clear that Rex has the full backing
of the ﬁrst lady. White House courtiers
should take note of that, and of Rex’s ex-
cellent behavior, before they try to send him
into oblivion with Lucky, McFarlane et al.

And Soviet General Secretary Mikhail

Gorbachev should not think that Rex is an
effete weakling. Though small in size,
these Cavalier King Charles Spaniels have
courage. In the ﬁrst illustrated edition of
Shakespeare, an engraving of a quarrel
from "The Taming of the Shrew” shows
one of Rex ’s ancestors barking vociferously
to encourage the combatants.

Perhaps the greatest popularizer of these
dogs, aside from Charles H, was John
Churchill, ﬁrst Duke of Marlborough and
one of England’s greatest miltary com-
manders. While directing the allied (with
Austria) victory at Blenheim (now part of
West Germany) in 1704 over French and
Bavarian forces, the duke had with him one
of the small, liver-red-and-white spaniels
that were his trademark. When he was
awarded an estate in Oxfordshire as a re-
ward for his services, it was named Blen-
heim to commemorate his victory; “Blen-
heim” also came to signify the red—and-
white color of the spaniels the duke bred.

Two hundred ﬁfty years after the victory
at Blenheim, Randolph Churchill canied
on the family tradition of Cavaliers by hav-
ing a house full of them. At dinner, they
used to crowd onto a settee in his dining
room and wait for tidbits to fall their way.
Two Cavalier tricolors were owned by Rep.
Larry McDonald, a Georgia Democrat
who died on KAL Flight 007, and others
loyally surround Rey Cohn and William F.
Buckley Jr. who introduced the Reagans
to Cavaliers. In sum, do not rnisjudge those
limpid eyes: The Cavalier IS not a‘ ‘wimpy’
dog, nor is it a dog for wirnps.

Reducing animal testing

Congressional report offers list of alternatives but
warns again st a complete ban on such experiments

By Keith Henderson

Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor

 

Boston

The use of animals for academic re-
search and product testing, long a subject
of passionate concern to animal-rights ac-
tivists, is moving squarely into the main-
stream of public concern.

A massive report by the congressional
Office of Technology Assessment (OTA),
released Feb. 1, heralds a growing aware-
ness in and out of govemment'that much
testing and experimentation on animals
— ranging from monkeys to mice -— is un-
necessary, often poorly regulated, and
that alternatives to _ g _ .

medical and behavioral research and tox-
icity testing in the US, the report states.
More likely, development of alterna- .-
tive means of testing and experimentation “
will lead to a significant cutback in the .
numbers of animals being used. Both sci-

entists and many animal-rights groups
hail such things as a marked decrease in
the use of the “classic LD50" toxicity
test, which involved the dosing of 100 or
more rodents until half that number
died.New techniques have cut the number
of animals used to as few as 10.

the United States each year. Prominent
among these new methods:

0 The use of cell cultures instead of
live animals. This so-called in Vitro
‘method holds particular promise in re-
placing some of the standard eye- ' and

rodents. Such tests have traditionally

0 The use of microorganisms for cer-
tain kinds of toxicity testing instead of
larger animals.

0 Computer simulation of organic sys-
tems and chemical reactions. This could
help pinpoint the likely harm from new
chemical compounds and thus cut down
on the use of animals.

0 Better collection and distribution of
past data from tests of new chemical com‘
pounds. This would eliminate repeat test-
ing on animals of substances already
known to be harmful.

The OTA report, while pointing out the
more-humane treatment made possible by
these advances, notes that a complete ban
on animal testing “must be considered
dangerous." That option would halt most

A Some animal rightist argue, owever,
that even that many is too many. They as-
sert that the means to completely replace

simply too set in their ways.

the last half-decade. The driyirig force be-

gmovement, accord-
3ing to Henry Spira,
)a New York-based
g activist who served
‘on an advisory
board to the OTA.
The most positive
thing about the
new report, says
Mr. Spira, is that
“it could legitimize
the whole area. . . .

 

Nobody could have

envisioned five
years ago Congress asking for a big study
on alternatives."

Release of the OTA report is one in a
chain of events that is helping to create "a
critical mass to push the issue of animai
testing and experimentation into the
mainstream." continues Spira. Other
waymarks, he says, include: funding of
research on alternatives by the Nations}
Cancer Institute and the National Toxi-
cology Program (a branch of the Food and
Drug Administration); collection of data
on animal testing by the National Library
of Medicine; and the recent crackdown on
Columbia University by the National In-
stitutes of Health. The NIH found the uni-

versity negligent in providing proper

health care and sanitation for its labora-
tory animals.

At the prodding of animal-rights
groups and adverse public opinion, a
number of cosmetics and household pro-
ducts firms have helped underwrite re-
search on alternative testing in recent
years. The Center for Alternatives to Ani-
mal Testing, at Johns Hopkins Univer—
sity, was set up largely through a grant
from the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fra-
grance Association. The creation of the
Johns Hopkins facility “was spurred by
the animal-rights activity” says Steve
Push, a spokesman for the center. He sees
“a very strong commitment on the part of
larger corporations to find alternatives to
animal testing.”

A Cat’s Got the Tongues

By DIRK JOHNSON

Special to The New York Times

WOODBURY, Conn., Jan. 29 —
Fred was snoozing atop a library desk
—- exhausted, perhaps, from prowling
about the stacks.

“Fred is very laid-back,” a librar-

ian explained.

Fred, an aging alley cat, lives in the
library.
“It’s a welcoming, relaxed li-

Smith. “And we feel Fred has con-
tributed to that.”
But Phyllis Delaney, who said she
, was terrified of cats, feels neither
welcomed, nor relaxed, by the pres-
' ence of Fred. “1 can’t use the library
with a cat there,” she said. “I’d have
a heart attack.”
Asserting her library rights as a
f taxpayer, Mrs. Delaney has called for
the cat’s ouster. She has taken her
case from the Town Hall to the Gover-
nor’s office.
“Whose rights are more impor-

Fred's loyalists, meanwhile, have.

united behind 11-year-old Stephanie
Courtney, mounting a letter-writing
campaign and petition drive in sup-

‘ “I love Fred,” said Stephanie, a

get kicked out, I didn’t want that.
Fred’s been so nice to me.”

to Town Hall opposing Fred’s evic-'
tion.

Fred, who is believed to be about 14
years old, has been residing in the li-
brary since 1976, when members of
the library staff found the shivering
stray wandering outside the building.

“I’ve never known a cat like Fred,"

said Ann Bumstead, the children's li- '

brarian, who feeds the cat. “Fred
doesn’t have a normal stuck-up cat
personality. Fred’s more like a placid
golden retriever."

Town officials searched vainly for
legal precedents on library cats.

“There appears to be nothing in the
law which prohibits the housing of a
cat in a library,” said First Select-
man. Elizabeth Adams, the chief
elected official.

As a result, Mrs. Adams told the li~
brary board, the library staff is free
to keep Fred “for the rest of his natu-
ral life.”

“The whole state of Connecticut
thanks you,” said Mrs. Smith, the
chief librarian.

“It’s bigger than Connecticut,”
Mrs. Adams said. “We’ve had calls
from Boston.”

The library board sent a letter to
Mrs. Delaney, offering to deliver any
library books to her home — an offer
she had earlier rejected.

“People are ridiculing me,” Mrs.

Delaney said, “like I’m some old
‘ fool.”

She has been subjected, she said, to
nasty letters, nasty phone calls and a
dead mouse in her mailbox.

“That cat,” she said, “has more
character and intelligence than the
people who defend it.”

Blanketed by snow, shaded by
woods and crisscrossed by rivers, this
quiet town in the Litchfield Hills ap-
pears posed for a holiday postcard.
But some residents believe the pic-
turesque countryside could use an
airbrush, a light retouching of the
natural beauty. More and more, town
planners said, homeowners are dig-
ging through the landscape to create

. ponds they believe will improve the

esthetics.

The ponds, they believe, create an
idyllic New England setting here, a
tranquil town of 7,200 with white-stee-
pled churches, an 18th-century inn
and dozens of antiques shops.

phere.” ,

The town planners, however, ex-
press worry that a sharp increase in
man-made ponds might upset the
natural order by diverting the course
of a river.

In addition, excavation that brings
ground water to the surface could in-
troduce added pollutants to the river
flow, said Robert J. Hannon, a town
planner. “You wouldn’t think a pond
could cause much trouble,” he said.
“But you have to be very careful.”

In some cases, Mr. Hannon said,
homeowners are digging ponds, not
for property enhancement but rather
to sell the gravel they excavate. With
good gravel worth $5 to $7 a cubicI
yard, he said, pond diggers are min-.
ing as much as 15,000 cubic yards and
turning a handsome profit.

“We’re suspicious of ulterior mo-
tives,” he said. “Sometimes, it's all
for a quick buck.” =

But Mr. Shepard said small-scale
pond excavations, such as those on
his farm, could hardly bring riches in
gravel. “Mostly, we just get more'
wildlife on the property —— ducks,
geese, cranes,” he said. “That’s nice,

like being out in Minnesota.”

the playwright, sports a score of fa-
mous autographs, including those of
the writers Alfred Kazin, William
Styron and Theodore H. White.

The genuine doily will be auctioned
to benefit the local Democratic
Party. Last year, Mrs. Elsenboss and
the Democrats raised $25 by selling a
towel once used by Dustin Hoffman,
the actor.

Woodbury,” she said. “And now, of
course, we’ve got Fred the cat.”

He who steals the purse might steal
trash. But he who takes the trash, this
town fears, will want the purse, too.
Within a year, Woodbury’s landfill
will be full. After that, disposing of
the town’s garbage will present some
vexing and expensive problems.

“Getting rid of the garbage,” said
First Selectman Adams, “is issue
No. 1.”

This month, Woodbury formed the
Solid Waste Study Committee. The
group’s task is to find a method of
garbage disposal that won’t bankrupt
the town budget.

With most landfills in the region
Closing, Woodbury will be forced to
send its waste to a resource-recovery
plant, which burns the garbage into
steam, then electricity.

But no such local plant will be oper-
ating for the next few years. So the
town must pay “big bucks,” said
Mrs. Adams, to transport the trash to
a distant town.

This year, the town spent about
$45,000 on waste disposal. In next.
year’s budget, the diSposal costs will
grow to more than $241,000, or about
10 percent of the $2.3 million budget.
In future years, those costs could con-
tinue to escalate.

“It will send our budget out of
sight,” Mrs. Adams said. “It’s a real
problem for small towns in Connect-
icut. Something has got to give some-
where.”

The purr—fect puzzle

 

By Robert Cooke

Science/Medicine Writer

 

Some cats purr in a low and gentle vibrato, others
with a gutsy rumble. In all cats --. of both sexes, all
shapes and sizes -- purring is a sign of contentment,
usually starting off small and tentative, gradually
building into a relaxed and confident statement of
pleasure.

But despite the centuries of close relations between
man and furry felines, the way in which cats purr has
always remained a mystery.

It’s a mystery that Tulane University senior Dawn
Frazer hOpes will soon be resolved. She hOpes her
study of the biomechanics of purring will yield new in-
sight into problems of human neurOphysiology. .

If purring is controlled by the nervous system, she
says, then learning how purring works could help doc-
tors understand problems in humans that involve trem-
bling, such as epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease.

If her ideas are correct, tests designed to see what
stops cats from purring might also be useful: “Then
you could give the same thing to peeple and reduce the
complications of illness,” she says.

David Rice, her adviser and a biomedical engineer-
ing professor, explains that her project “may have
some implications into neurOphysiology,” such as how
muscles are controlled by the nervous system.

He says Ms. Frazer’s work -— her senior project at
Tulane — is the first study he’s aware of that looks di-
rectly into the mechanics of cats’ purring.

At present, however, Ms. Frazer is far from finding
the purring mechanism. Last September she began se-
lecting a group of seven cats —— ranging in age from 1
month to mature adults, the largest weighing 14
pounds. So far she’s recorded purring from all seven,

 

but has only studied one -— named Snow — very close-

- ly. Snow was picked first because of her vigorous purr-

ing, and Snow is 3150 now Ms. Frazer’s household pet.

She adds that cats probably purr for various rea-
sons. “When l’m fighting with my cat, for instance, she
sometimes starts purring when she wants to quit, when
she’s had enough. It’s kind of like a person beginning to
smile to bring down the level of conflict.”

The cats, she said, don’t seem to mind her measur-
ing their purring. “I just have one or two micrOphones
in my hand, and I just hold them up to the cat’s chest.
They don’t object.”

Based on Snow’s measurements, Ms. Frazer sug-
gests that purring results from a combination of dia-
phragm movements and vibrations of the cat’s vocal
cords. To find this information, she placed microphones
on Snow’s throat and diaphragm, then recorded the re-
sults. ' '

The next step, measuring muscular movements, is
expected to show that the cat’s diaphragm “is doing
more than helping the cat breathe.”

The recordings made on Snow already show that
cats purr at s ecific frequencies; Snow’s rumbling oc-
curs at 25 cyc es per second, comparable in frequency
to a large diesel engine idling.

Rice points out, however, that the purring sound
from other cats may be different. “It might depend on
their size.”

Ms. Frazer’s data also show that Snow purrs louder
when exhaling. “That shows there is something near
her vocal cords which is involved” in purring, she said.

The main problem in her research is feline fickle-
ness. Cats don’t purr on cue. Snow took quite awhile,
for example, to get comfortable with being a laborato-
ry animal. Once she adjusted, however, it took only a
few gentle strokes to start her motor humming.

 




Traps set for dog after E. Texas

 

Associated Press

LONGVIEW — Authorities set
traps Friday for a dog that escaped
from a pack that severely mauled a
6-year-old boy, and state health of-
ficials examined the remains of
other canines for rabies.

Steven Mark Fiengo Jr. re-
mained in critical condition Friday
following surgery at Parkland Me-
morial Hospital‘. in Dallas, a spokes-
woman said. ‘Zi‘he roving pack of
eight dogs attacked the child on

Wednesday, inflicting about 100

. wounds, relatives said.

A Gregg County sheriff’s inves-
tigator killed one of the animals

with a 12-gauge shotgun as it'

lunged at him, and officers cap-
tured and later destroyed six other
animals. But one dog escaped, said
Sgt. B.W. Acker. '

“Officers are checking the area
as often as their other duties will
allow,” Acker said Friday. “A
number of traps have been placed
in the area. And the owner of the

dogs is cooperating in trying to
find the animal.”

He said the heads of the six ani-
mals destroyed by county officials
were sent to the Texas Department

' of Health in Austin for rabies

analysis.

The boy was attacked near the
Gregg County livestock auction
barn off Farm Road 2087, Acker
said. His mother, Brenda Sue
Fiengo, found the child after he
did not answer her calls.

Relatives said the dogs dragged

the boy about 40 feet before he
was rescued. He received more
than 25 pints of blood during
several operations at Parkland’s
Pediatric Trauma Unit for injuries
to his legs, buttocks, arms and
chest.

The attack occurred just before
dusk while the boy played outside
a house where he and his mother
were visiting friends who live in
western Longview in East Texas.

Relatives said the boy was near
a small pond in a pasture between

b0y is maﬁlled by peel;

two houses. Acker said his mother
found him near the pond, with the
dogs nearby. .

She rushed her son by private
vehicle to Good Shepherd Medical
Center, and the child was trans-

ferred by helicopter to Parkland.

The dogs, part pit bulls, were
“semi-wild” and belonged to a
neighbor of the friend. He said the
owner agreed to destroy the dogs.

“Investigator Robert Harshaw
located one of the dogs and it tried
to attack him,” said Acker. “Har—

i

Shaw had to kill it with a 12-gaugv
shotgun before it got him . . . ”

Sheriff’s Sgt. Mike Claxton said
the sheriff’s department had re—
ceived several calls in the past con—
cerning packs‘of dogs and attacks.

“That is inside the city limits
and that area has a rigidly eno
forced leash law,” said Acker.

He said the attack may have
been “the most severe in the hism~
ry of Greg County.”

Acker said no criminal charges
have yet been filed. i

SATURDAY EVENING POST

Scratching Kitty’s Claws

Your correspondent objecting to
Dr. White’s mention of cat declawing
is the same propaganda myth I have
heard before and with very much the
same wording. Front-declawing an
offending cat is a very humane
method of preventing serious destruc-
tion of property, people, and pets,
when no other method will work (in-
cluding the scratching post). These
cats can still defend themselves with
teeth and their back claws. They can
climb trees and catch mice. I have
known many to run all other dogs
and cats away from their property,
and their owners laugh when told by
other people how defenseless they
would be.

In more than 30 years of practice
and after thousands of declawing pro-
cedures, I have never seen cats “bleed
to death, develop impaired balance,
become biters...” as a result of being
or not being declawed, or “develop
impaired balance with eventual weak-
ening of their leg, shoulder, and back
muscles.” (Does ear-lobe piercing
cause deafness?) The nails are retract-
able and are not to be equated with
fingernails or a dog’s toenails. A cat’s
claws are good as offensive weapons.
The nail is certainly not ‘ ‘their finger”
and any veterinarian who feels that
declawing is a “painful mutilation”
and has “seen firsthand the incredible
suffering” had better reexamine his
surgical techniques.

An extension of this myth is the
ploy that it is better to have a cat “put
to sleep” than to have it declawed.
Some organizations that sponsor
spaying and neutering programs (vet-
erinarians voluntarily give discounts
for them) even refuse this serv-

ice for cats who have been declawed.
This is simply a testimony to the type
of logic perpetuated by this cause.
Your Dr. White is right on track.
You are to be commended for pub-
lishing her many articles dedicated to
the humane welfare of all animals.

Anim a1 rights

I think that Charles Griswold
Jr., in his article on animal
rights in The Tribune on Jan. 14,
makes several points that must
be addressed.

First, the animal rights move-
ment is not a monolithic block
but is divided among itself as to
how far to take the rights issue.

‘_Some advocate limited use of

animals in laboratory testing,
others want no use at all. Consid-
ering the record of such drugs as
Oroflex and Thalidomide, which

[were tested on animals but

proved deadly to humans, I’m

‘ not sure that the stronger ap-
. proach isn’t right. ,

One point he fails to mention

is the millions of animals killed
_each year in the name of high
.school and even grade school sci-

ence. If children are taught ear-
ly that animals are disposable
what will their outlook be to—

ward all life as they grow older? '

Also, what of the millions of ani-
mals killed to repeat already-
known research or those used in
the cosmetics industry? Must

animals die to develop a new
mascara?

As for food, the use of meat is
more for pleasure than any real

need. The human body can get

by just fine on a vegetable diet
and with a little imagination this
needn’t be bland either. It’s time
we dropped the idea that vege-
tarians are slightly weird and
recognize that many well-known
peOple, such as George Bernard
Shaw, were vegetarians.

As for clothing, again the use

_ of animal products is more for
style or personal pleasure than

comfort or durablilty. Cotton

and modern synthetics can pro-

? vide all the material necessary.
vAlso, I have yet to understand

why several foxes, otters or oth-
é er animals must be killed just to
provide some lady with a coat
1 that she can show off to her

friends.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - January 30, 1986

Sheena the elephant dies unexpectedly at Canadian park ’

The Lowry Park Zoo “star”
had been sent to Canada
while the Tampa zoo was
being renovated.

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune Staff Writer

Sheena is dead.

Officials at Tampa’s Lowry Park 200 an-
nounced Wednesday the “very sudden” death
of the 27-year-old elephant who was being
housed temporarily at a Canadian animal at-
traction while her Tampa home is being reno-
vated.

Heart failure was the cause of death, based
on a preliminary autopsy report.

Since Sheena was shipped to Canada last
May, zoo officials had expressed hope she
would return to Tampa pregnant. There were
periodic reports on breeding attempts.

If the Lowry Park Zoo had a star, it was
Sheena.

The pachyderm arrived in Tampa in
December 1960 at the age of 2, a gift to the
children of the city from Lt. Gen. Sumter L.

Lowry. Recently, the Lowry family gave
$500,000 toward the construction of an Asian
Domain exhibit, which would have been
Sheena’s new home when it was completed.

Sheena’s original home also is being saved.
It was one of the few structures not ear-
marked for destruction during the $14.3 mil-
lion zoo renovation project.

200 Director Doug Porter said Sheena ac-
tually died Jan. 17, but the city has delayed an-
nouncing the bad news until an autopsy could
be conducted. '

Porter said a preliminary autopsy report
by Dr. Ian Barker of the University of Guelph,
near Cambridge, Ontario, indicated Sheena
died of heart failure.

The report said the heart failure “was a
metabolic defect resulting in rapid degenera-
tion of heart muscle.”

City officials said the specific cause of the
heart failure “may never be known.” But Por-
ter said Barker had ruled out viral infections,
nutrition or vitamin deficiency and toxicity.

Porter said he also didn’t think the cold
weather in Canada, compared to what Sheena
was used to in Tampa, contributed to her
death.

“That’s the first thing I asked 'age 68
myself,” Porter said, regarding the
weather. _

But Porter said he was con-
vinced Sheena had been adapting to
the colder weather without any diffi-
culty.

In captivity, Porter said, ele-
phants usually live to be about 40.

“She (Sheena) was -in her
prime,” Porter said.

Porter said there was no indica-
tion Sheena was ill or having any

problems “until she died very sud-
denly.”

Porter said when he visited
Sheena at the African Lion Safari in
Canada last September “she was ob-
viously content, well-adjusted and
comfortable in an environment that
was far superior to any we could
provide at that time.”

“I was completely satisified and
really eager for her to enjoy the new
environment we planned for her
here in Tampa.”

Porter said the 200 will wait to
purchase another elephant until the
first phase of the zoo renovation is
nearly completed during the sum-
mer of 1987.

Chimpanzoo permits students
do study primates’ behavior

. COLORADO SPRINGS. Cole. —
3 Perched high on the edge of the Colo-
. rado Rockies. the. Cheyenne Mountain
j Zoe seems light years away from the
f Tanzanian jungles where Jane Goodall
i has tracked chimpanzee behavior over
i the last 25 years.

i Yet it is here that Goodall came up
i with the idea of her newest enterprise.
i Chimpanzee. While Goodall studies the
: wild chimps at Gomhe Stream Wildlife
Preserve. college students will study
i captive chimps at Cheyenne Mountain
; and five other zoos across the United
a States.

. The distances from Gomhe are part
i of what made Goodall think it would
work.

Q In 1975. four of Geodall's researchers
; were kidnapped and held by rebels

g from nearby Zaire. The four were re-
; leased safe. after two months. but the
f‘ incident meant that “Gomhe became a
; politically sensitive area" for the Tan-
. zanian government.

‘ The government discouraged further

f “imports." and “I myself did not feel
. that I wanted to take the responsibility
: (for their safety)." Goodall explains.

4 Hundreds of people. meanwhile. their
3 interest piqued by National Geographic
; television specials and articles, con-

f tinue to write Goodall each year. ask-
? ing to come and help —- even if only by

; washing dishes for the others.

, “It‘s always rather sad to write back

énow that ‘There’s nothing I can offer

L you: there's no way to be part of my
; research.” she says.

f Chimpanzee gives peeple a chance to

istudy primates without leaving the

:United States. It draws students from

913.3. colleges and universities to zoos

.3 near their campuses.

‘ Some of what US. researchers learn

tfrem watching captive chimps will re-

:iniorce what Gomhe researchers have

1 learned. showing behavioral traits that

are “really. truly. innately chimp and

iabsolutely unchangeable, regardless of
ithe environment," Goodall predicts.

Michael Nowak is the Colorado Col-
lege primatologist who heads the local
Chimpanzee effort, along with a psy-
chology professor and zoo officials. He
thinks Chimpanzee studies will also
“show us a lot about what captivity
does.” -

Colorado College isvnoted for its
“modular” approach to the liberal arts,
immersing students in one limited area

‘ of study for about a month at a time.

Goodall has suggested introducing
items like stationary pots of honey or

honey out of the pot. just as they would
with twigs in the wild. .

“It would be a lot more interesting

The Cheyenne Mountain cages are

“Obviously. it‘s very sad for me to
see chimps in cages." she says. softly.

 




really present, they do not dive for
cover as they otherwise do when they
hear the warning signal. But they must
glance toward the sentinel to check;
the penalty for ignoring a true alarm
can be death. This momentary distrac-
tion, Munn theorizes, gives the sentinel
a slight edge in the aerial battles,
which are over in a split second.

“I have no reason not to think they
know what they are doing,” said
Munn. “But I can’t prove it.”

Gould said that an especially inter-
esting aspectof the Peruvian finding
was the surprising degree of behavior.
al flexibility it revealed; the birds are
using the same signal in two different
ways, one honest, one not. “It would be
nice to know what it’s based on,” he
said. “Is it innate or learned, and if
learned, how?”

“Maybe the birds are much smart-
er than we thought,” said Gould, who
has directed experiments that provide
startling evidence of the ability of bees
to remember and plan.

In nature, the strongest evidence
of intentional, self-aware deception
comes from chimpanzees, man’s clos-
est animal relatives. Jane Goodall,
working in Tanzania in the 705, first
reported chimpanzee guile in the wild
when she described how one male led

others away from a pile of bananas,
then sneaked back alone to eat.

“Deception seems to permeate all
aspects of chimpanzee social life,..and
chimpanzee skills in deceit are amatch
for human lie-detecting abilities,
wrote Frans de Waal of the University
of Wisconsin in the new book about
human and animal deception. "

Some scientists contend that,
among ancient humans, the advan.
tages of occasional lying and of being
able to spot the lies of others might
have stimulated the development of
language and intellect.

In an article last year in American
Anthropologist, Jeffrey A. Kurland
and Stephen J. Beckerman of Pennsyl-
vania State University prOposed that

the exchange of information about
food sources was a primary force driv-
ing human ancestors toward the c00p-
erative sociality that distinguished
them from many other primates.

Given the widely scattered nature
of food sources in the African savan-
nas where humans are thought to have
evolved, those that pooled information
would have eaten better than the lon-
ers, the scientists argued.

But individuals who could «glean
more useful information from others
than they gave would have eaten best
of all, and “systems of reciprocity
seem open to subtle cheating,” the sci-
entists noted. -.

Over time, “the overall pressure to
receive accurate information ”and
transmit less than wholly accurate in.
formation becomes enormous,” they
wrote. “Information about. individuals
who are themselves reliable sourcas of

, “Such a process, though not
necessitating language, would certain-
ly seem to lay the foundation for its
evolution,” the article continued. “It
has not escaped our attention that
such a scenario has obvious implica-
tions for understanding the increase
in brain size that occurred during
hominid evolution.”

“We’re not arguing that humans
evolved because of unbridled Maehia
vellian competition,” Kurland said: in
an interview. “But it’s an elemen’ﬁin
our lives. It’s the tension, the dialectic
between cooperation and competitipn,
that pushes social evolution.”

Studies of deceit in many species
have all agreed on one point: No indi:
vidual can live by deception alone:

“For deception to succeed,”§:7§bo
served Mitchell, “there has to be seine
grounding in the truth.” “"

uﬁ

“Deception between members of a
species is the exception rather than
the rule,” said Gould. “When used too
often, false signals lose their value.’.’.

BY’ER/K ECKHOLM

 

New York
n the rain forests of Peru, a
scientist has caught two
species of birds in the avi-
an equivalent of crying
wolf. The birds, sentinels whose
job is to warn their flocks when
a predator is lurking, often
sound false alarms to divert
their competitors as the senti-
nels swoop toward a tasty bug.

This phony call, reported in the
scientific journal Nature, is just one of
a growing number of deceptive behav-
iors discovered in the animal world,
behaviors that have piqued the inter-
est of researchers from several disci-
plines.

Some scientists are studying such
acts of deception as a way of learning
more about the mental processes of
animals. Others are examining how
the tension between truthfulness and

Humans- display
the most complex
deceptions in the
animal kingdom

The study of deception can aid in
the understanding of “how it is that
animals cope with their world, what
level of complexity they have psycho-
logically,” said Robert W. Mitchell, a
research associate in psychology at
Clark University who is co-editor of a
new book, “Deception: Perspectives on
Human and Nonhuman Deceit” (State
University of New York Press).

In the book, scientists describe a
wide spectrum of devious behaviors in
animals, ranging from the treachery
of certain female fireflies, who lure
male fireflies they will devour by
flashing in the pattern of the males'
genuine mates, to the uses of decep-
tion by humans in sports and military
battles.

Evolution can fix complex behav-
ior into the genes of a species, presum-
ably including the siren flashes of
predatory fireflies. But acts of deceit
that are novel and require advance
planning, such as when a chimpanzee
leads his fellows away from hidden
food he will later retrieve, are power-
ful evidence of abstract thought, in the

view of many scientists.

Students of nature have long

 

trickery molds social relations among
members. of the same species.

It is humans, of course, that dis-
play the most varied, complex and pre~
meditated deceptions in the animal

kingdom. Some scientists even specu-
late that subtle efforts by human an-

cestors to outwit their fellows might
have helped spur the evolution of
higher intelligence and language.

known that deception is common be-
tween predators and prey of different
species. But only in recent studies, fol-
lowing advances in the understanding
of how natural selection operates, has
the role of deceit between members of
the same species been widely ob
served.

There was once a general belief
that “animals were honest with each
other and acted for the good of the

species,” said James L. Gould, an ex- ‘
pen on animal behavior at Princeton

University. But now biologists have
come to realize that members of the
same species are very much in compe-
tition with each other for resources
and reproductive success.

And with new theories in mind,
scientists observing animals in the
wild began to notice deceitful acts
they had previously overlooked or ig-
nored.

Still, Gould stressed, animals oftei
learn to be wary of lies, and “mos
,signals between members of the sam

*;.7species are honest.”

The case of the false alarm call
recently documented in Peru present
a different combination: The tricke-
birds are of different species from th
sentinels, but all are bound together i
a cooperative relationship in mult
species flocks that stay together.

5 Charles A. Munn of the New Yori
Zoological Society discovered the mis
leading signals inadvertently afte
years of patient observation of th
flocks in Peru’s Manu National Park
Afte'r noticing the false alarms ii
; flocks inhabiting the understory of th<
L‘rain forest, he looked for and foundi
gamong the flocks — composed of dité
i ferent species —— that forage higher u,
in the forest canopy as well.

“I think that deceptive behavio
among birds may be much more Wid£
spread than is acknowledged in th
scientific literature,” said Munn, at
thor of the Nature report.

The bluish-slate antshrike is th

leader and sentinel species of the un-
derstory flocks, which usually contain
about 40 individuals from 20 to 30 spe-
c1es. In the canopy the same role is
played by the white-winged Shrike-
tanager. .

Most of the birds spend their time
searching the vegetation for large in-
sects, especially katydids. Once
flushed out, katydids often try to es-
cape by simply dropping toward the
ground, causing a mad aerial scramble
of birds hoping to grab the juicv mor-
sel as it falls. '

All the while, the foraging birds

depend on the sentinel to watch the
sky and sound the alarm when a bird.
eating hawk approaches. But these
sentinel species also cry “hawk,” Munn
observed, when they are racing their
flockmates for a falling insect.

The other birds have apparently
learned to be skeptical of the alarms.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - Jan. 27, 1986

Tampa zoo association ‘
plans African photo safari

By BRUCE DUDLEY
Tribune Staff Writer

You’ve seen it in Tarzan and J un-
gle Jim movies and on “Wild King-
dom” with Marlin Perkins.

Now, the Lowry Park Zoo Associ-
ation is inviting Tampa Bay area
residents to view the jungles and
plains of Africa as they really are.

Zoo Director Doug Porter is
going to lead a photographic safari
to Kenya for 16 days in March and
April.

The safari also comes as the zoo
association prepares to launch its
fund-raising drive for a $14.3 million
renovation, and Porter makes no
apologies about the fact that the sa-
fari is geared to promote the zoo.

People going on the safari, Por-
ter said, will be able to see animals
in the wild and get a better idea of
what the city hopes to create in
providing animals with the best pos-
sible natural surroundings while in
captivity.

About 10 people have signed up
for the safari thus far, and Porter
said arrangements need to be made
before the end of the month even
though the trip is still weeks away.

The safari, which will leave
Tampa March 16 and return April 2,

is being arranged through Interna-
tional Expeditions Inc. of Birming-
ham, Ala. The cost for each person
is $2,995, which includes meals and
lodging. .

The zoo association has talked
about arranging such trips to pro-
mote the zoo, but this is the first trip
actually scheduled. .

During the trip, participants will
visit several areas of Africa includ-
ing Amboseli National Park near Mt.
Kilimanjaro. - 1.;

An Africian exhibit is planned
for the renovated zoo, but it will not
be included in the first phase of the
new 200 to be completed.

An “Asian Domain” is being
planned first because the zoo al-
ready owns many of the animals
needed for such an exhibit, includ-
ing bears, tigers and Sheena, an
Asian elephant.

The City Council is scheduled to
receive a recommendation this
week to award a $6.3 million con-
tract to the David Nelson ConstructL
tion Co. to build the first phase of the
new zoo. This work also is expected
to begin about the time of Porter’s‘
Africian safari.

The zoo itself will remain open
during all the construction at tempo-
rary quarters, until the first phase of
the renovation is completed.

Trainer bails out
3 exotic animals

Houston animal trainer Pau-
lette Rottman got her wallaby, ba-
boon and python back from city
health officials Thursday after
paying $300 to bail them out of
intpoundment.

. Officials seized the 5-month-old
baboon named Janet, the 1-year-
old wallaby named Wally and the
Swear-old Burmese python named
Cleo from Rottman’s southwest
Houston home Wednesday.

City ordinances prohibit the
keeping of wild animals within 300
feet of a residence. Luann Van
Somer, Rottman’s partner, signed
a notarized statement that the ani-
mals would be moved outside the
city, said city veterinarian Dr. Ka-
ren Kemper.

Rottman also had to pay $100 on
each animal for impoundment and
boarding fees. She earlier paid
similar fees to get a Siberian tiger
named Toy out of city custody af-
ter it was seized Tuesday.

'"jThe animals are being quar-
tered at a friend’s feed store in
Richmond, Rottman said.

l Furry, feathery friends
like brrr in Old Brooklyn

By TOM ANDRZEJEWSKI
STAFF WRITER

It was so cold early this week that
many of the residents of one Old
Brooklyn neighborhood stayed
indoors.

No trying to dig out the car and
shovel the driveway. No bundling the
kids off to school. No complaining to
City Hall about snowedcin side
streets.

' The reclusive Old Brooklynites
were most of the Cleveland Metro-
parks Zoo’s penguins, two of its three
polar bears and many otherwise cold-
climate birds and mammals.

The temperature at mid-morning
Tuesday was bouncing between 3 and
5 degrees, even though the sun was
Out. But temperature was not the
main consideration for these ani-
mals.

Sure. And if you believe that, how
about some stock in the Brooklyn-
Brighton Bridge?

“It’s not temperature, really,” said
Richard D. Nemeth, the 200’s curator
of education, using penguins as an

example. “It’s a question of the pond
freezing.

“They can take the cold, but water
is the key,” said Nemeth. Birds need

it to preen, that is, renew their coat
of feathers, as well as for drinking.

 

-—n———-—

Actually, not all penguins come
from continually frigid places such
as Antarctica. One variety, the Hum-
boldt penguin, is from warmer
climes in waters off South America.
Although it can withstand colder
temperatures, that species is inside
for the winter.

 

‘They could break a limb. With a giraffe, for
instance, I don’t know anyone who has set a

broken leg successfully. ’

'— Richard D. Nemeth, Metroparks Zoo’s curator of education.

 

OK, so what about the polar bears?
Nyat, the male, was lounging in a
snowbank yesterday, snoozing in the
sun. His two girlfriends were some-
where inside the rockpile-like exhi-
bit.

The big guy - otherwise a ~fero-
cious predator (that’s why the polar
bear pond is drained down about
eight feet in the winter, just in case it
freezes and he can leap out) ~ didn’t
look put out, though.

He didn’t even look cold. But, as
Nemeth explained,’one of Nyat’s
favorite winter activities is plunging
his half-ton body onto the ice to break
it up into little icebergs.

Who needs girlfriends, with fun
activities like that?

 

Nyat’s neighbors, the seals and sea
lions, didn’t dare leave the water,
constantly swishing the currents of
their salt-water home. Some of it
froze, even with the constant motion.

Keeping pond water moving is the
secret to avoid ice-over. The water-
ing hole of the zoo’s llamas even had
some out-of-town visitors to help —
some ducks that apparently stopped
their migration when they saw food,
water and obviously exotic surround-
ings. .

The sandhill cranes seemed to
enjoy the cold, each balancing on one

leg. Though they appear tropical,

 

these specimens were from Minne-
sota. They like it when thermometers
longer than their legs show little or
no red. ‘

Most of the animals are free to

' roam in and out, although some are

brought in for the winter. Elephants

and giraffes, explained Nemeth,

could fall on ice or snow and break a

bone -- an orthOpedic surgeon’s
nightmare. ~

. ..
.. . .4

“They could break a limb,” said
Nemeth. “With a giraffe, for
instance, I don’t know anyone who
has set a broken leg successfully.”

So over at the 200’s African Plains
exhibit, the only evidence of giraffes
was the large, buff-colored building
in the background — the one with the
22-foot high garage doors.

Naturally, the cold didn’t bother

the Siberian tigers. Mom was loung-
ing on a well-packed layer of snow.

Two 10-month old, 100-pound cubs
relaxed behind her and scowled at

visitors.

Dad was in the next grotto, pacing
back and forth. But the pacmg may
not have been to keep warm.

“Keeping them apart like that is
our form of birth control,” said
Nemeth.

Wildlife at 10 national ref-
uges is threatened by chemi-
cals, but most of the USA’s 90
million wildlife acres are in
good shape, federal ofﬁcials
said Monday.

“By and large, we have a
healthy wildlife system,” said
William Horn, the Department
of Interior’s assistant secretary
for ﬁsh, wildlife and parks.

The 10 worst areas — and 74
others that need close watch-
ing -— were cited in a report by
government biologists Monday.

The problem sites represent
about 20 percent of the USA’s
wildlife refuge system —
which includes 431 areas in 49
states and ﬁve territories.

The problem sites are vic-
tims of various chemical pol-
lutants from famis, industrial
sites and military bases.

Horn said the report “tried
to err on the side of caution,”
and includes some sites merely
adjacent to areas of heavy

chemical use.

The worst: Kesterson Refuge
in the San Joaquin Valley east
of San Jose, Calif., where large
quantities of selenium are
thought to have caused repro-
ductive failure in some of the
refuge’s 200 bird species.

In 1984, parts were closed to
the public and biologists began
trying to frighten birds away
from Kesterson’s water.

Drainage of chemicals into
the refuge -—- thought to be the
cause of the problem —— is to be
halted by July 1, Horn said.

Others on the worst-10 listz,
Wheeler National Wildlife Ref-
uge, Decatur, Ala.; Kenai Ref-
uge at Cook Inlet, Alaska; Seal
Beach, Orange County, Calif.;
Johnston Atoll, west of Hawaii.

Also: Crab Orchard Refuge
at Carbondale, 111.; Great
Swamp Refuge at Morris Coun-
ty, N.J.; Ninigret Refuge at
Charlestown, R.I.; Eastern
Shore of Virginia Refuge at the
tip of the Delmarva Peninsula
in the Chesapeake Bay; and
Fisherman Island, Va., Refuge.

DETROIT FREE PRESS Sunday Magazine -‘ February 2, 1986

 

Carol T- time . . .

~, " It’s winter at the 200,

A .\;‘;; -- ran-H'

Steve Graham, 40, has been director of
the Detroit Zoological Park for five years. It’s
a job that consumes most of his time and
energy, especially during the summer.

What do you do in the winter, when
the zoo is so quiet?

Winter gives us an opportunity to evalu-
ate the summer programs . . . what worked
last season, what will work better next season
and which animals the public likes best.

Which animals love winter?

In the winter we don’t put the elephants
or the rhinoceros out because they need a
controlled climate, but most other animals
adapt. The polar bears love it. They can make
you shudder when they jump into ice-cold
water. When I first came here, we had some
monkeys that absolutely did not do well in
cold weather, so we get rid of that species and
got the snow monkey.

Aren’t there some winter days when
absolutely no one visits the zoo?

Oh, we do have days when nobody comes,
but on a good winter’s day we can expect 125
people or more, and that isn’t bad. Most
people forget about the zoo in the winter, and
that’s too bad, because in the winter it’s a
more personal experience. There isn’t a
crowd. It’s quiet. On a sunny day in winter

you can see more animals outside than you.

can see on a sunny day 1n the summer.

Do you ever walk around the 200 on a
cold winter night?

Yes. I live on the zoo grounds. I have it all
to myself when it’s closed. I slip into the llama
house to watch them quietly. I used to watch
the elephants. I like elephants a lot.

Why elephants?

Ypu can’t help but be awed by their size. I
don’t know . . . there’s just something that’s
always attracted me. They don’t lay down
very often. They sleep standing up .

How are the animals taking the noise
from the 1-696 freeway construction?

 

I. but Graham isn’t hibernating

Graham: “I’ll talk gibberish.”

 

I don’t think it’s going to be much of a
problem. The only animal who will be nega-
tively impacted by the expressway will be me,
because my house will face directly on Ten
Mile, right where the expressway is.

If someone gave you $1 million, what
would you do with it?

Can I up the ante, make it $5 million and
spend it all on the new chimp exhibit? I would
like this exhibit to be at least an acre, with a
moat, tall trees, underground quarters, rocky
ledges and at least 20 to 40 chimps.

Has an animal ever attacked you?

Once or twice. A guanaco (a Scuth Ameri-
can mammal related to the camel) once
struck me right in the center of the forehead
with his two knees, knocked me to the
ground, and I didn’t know what was going on.
He did that three or four times until I got out
of his territory.

Do you talk to the animals?

Well, someone will say I’m crazy if I do,
but actually I do. One of the most important
things to convey to an animal is that you’re
not a threat. When I want an animal to feel
comfortable, I’ll talk gibberish.

Do you ever like animals more than

people?
That’s an unfair question.

polar bears and many otherwise cold-
climate birds and mammals.

The temperature at mid-morning
Tuesday was bouncing between 3 and
5 degrees, even though the sun was
Out. But temperature was not the
main consideration for these ani-
mals.

Sure. And if you believe that, how
about some stock in the Brooklyn-
Brighton Bridge?

“It’s not temperature, really,” said
Richard D. Nemeth, the zoo’s curator
of education, using penguins as an
example. “It’s a question of the pond
freezing.

“They can take the cold, but water
is the key,” said Nemeth. Birds need

it to preen, that is, renew their coat
of feathers, as well as for drinking.

Actually, not all penguins come
from continually frigid places such
as Antarctica. One variety, the Hum-
boldt penguin, is from warmer
climes in waters off South America.

‘They could break a limb. With a giraffe, for
instance, I don ’t know anyone who has set a

broken leg successfully. ’

‘— Richard D. Nemeth, Metroparks Zoo’s curator of education.

 

OK, so what about the polar bears?
Nyat, the male, was lounging in a
snowbank yesterday, snoozing in the
sun. His two girlfriends were some-
where inside the rockpile-like exhi-
bit.

The big guy - otherwise a “fero-
cious predator (that’s why the polar
bear pond is drained down about
eight feet in the winter, just in case it
freezes and he can leap out) —- didn’t
look put out, though.

He didn’t even look cold. But, as
Nemeth explained,‘one of Nyat’s
favorite winter activities is plunging
his half-ton body onto the ice to break
it up into little icebergs.

Who needs girlfriends, with fun
activities like that?

 

Nyat’s neighbors, the seals and sea

lions, didn’t dare leave the water,
constantly swishing the currents of
their salt-water home. Some of it
froze, even with the constant motion.

Keeping pond water moving is the
secret to avoid ice-over. The water-
ing hole of the 200’s llamas even had
some out-of-town visitors to help —
some ducks that apparently stopped
their migration when they saw food,
water and obviously exotic surround-
ings.

The sandhill cranes seemed to

Most of the animals are free to

brought in for the winter. Elephants
and giraffes, explained Nemeth,
could fall on ice or snow and break a
bone — an orthopedic surgeon’s
nightmare. ‘

“They could break a limb,” said
Nemeth. “With a giraffe, for

has set a broken leg successfully.”

So over at the 200’s African Plains
exhibit, the only evidence of giraffes
was the large, buff-colored building
in the background — the one with the
22-foot high garage doors.

Naturally, the cold didn’t bother

the Siberian tigers. Mom was loung-

Two 10-month old, lOO-pound cubs
relaxed behind her and scowled at
visitors.

Dad was in the next grotto, pacing
back and forth. But the pacmg may
not have been to keep warm.

“Keeping them apart like that is
our form of birth control,” said
Nemeth.

Abandoned pups move inland away from
the harems and the bulls, who are prone to
trample small objects in their paths. So if
you tour in February, you’ll pass big-eyed,
wistful pups huddled in “weaner pods” for
protection and company.

As the female population dwindles, the
males begin to depart, and by mid-March
the “weaners” have Ano Nuevo Point al-
most to themselves. They shed their black
baby fur for a silver coat, learn to swim in
the shallow waters offshore and one by one
head out to sea. By May, most are gone.

If you miss the elephant seals in the win-
ter, you can see them at Ano Nuevo during
molting season. The females return to molt
in April or early May, the bulls follow in Ju-
ly and August and juveniles may be seen
ashore in spring and fall. You do not need
reservations to tour Ano Nuevo Point in
these seasons, but docents are stationed
there to answer questions and make sure vis-
itors keep their distance from the seals.

Ano Nuevo Island and the surrounding
waters also host three relatives of the ele-
phant seal—the Stellar sea lion, present
from June to August; the California sea 1i-
on, a summer and fall visitor; and the harbor
seal, a year-round resident.

Beauty and the Bull: When the
Seals Come Back to Ann Nuevo

ou hear the bull elephant seals at Ano

Nuevo Reserve before you see them,

for as you start along the tour trail

leading across the dunes toward the
sea, an odd drumming rises above the sound
of the distant surf. This noise, you soon
learn, is not drumming at all, but challeng-
ing roars by big males proclaiming, “I can
lick any bull on the beach!”

As you proceed across the sands, you
next learn that gentle snores as well as roars
are characteristic of the elephant seal rook-
ery. Indeed, the ﬁrst bull encountered along
the tour trail will undoubtedly be a three-ton
lump of supine, drowsy ﬂesh burrowed into
a secluded wallow. When you stop to view
this behemoth, while standing the twenty
feet away from him prescribed by law, only
the twitching of whiskers and the lazy half-
opening of one big eye will belie his image of
indifferent torpor.

 

 

Both roars and torpor are key elements
in the cycle of birth and breeding you wit-
ness during tours to the rookery at Ano
Nuevo from December through April.

Until the early twentieth century, the
northern elephant seal, known as Mirounga
angustirostris in scientiﬁc circles, was hunt—
ed to near extinction for its oil-rich blubber.
The now-protected species returned to Ano
Nuevo Island in 1955, and the ﬁrst pup was
born there in 1961. Four years later, ele-
phant seals hauled out half a mile away on
the mainland at Ano Nuevo Point. In Janu-
ary 1975, a pup was born on the mainland;
last winter, the count was 640.

The island is closed to visitors, but the
mainland rookery is open daily during the
winter breeding season for closely con-
trolled, reservations-only tours led by volun-
teer docents.

The bulls begin arriving in late Novem-
ber, so early-December visitors see only
males of all ages. While awaiting the fe-
males, these males mainly snooze; occasion-

 

ally the bold, aggressive ones will lift their
pendulous snouts to roar challenges, or clash
in chest-to—chest combats. The combats help
determine who’s king of the dunes. The tor-
por between roaring bouts and ﬁghts con-
serves precious energy for these bulls, who
will not eat for up to 90 days.

The ﬁrst pregnant females haul out
around mid-December, with the ﬂow of ar-
rivals peaking by about mid-January. They
give birth three to six days after arrival, and
settle in to nurse their pups. Meanwhile, the
dominant bulls stake out harems and defend
them against other suitors. If you tour Ano
Nuevo from now through mid-February,
you’ll probably find the action and cacopho-
ny at its peak, as bulls roar and clash, fe-
males hiss, grunt and cry and pups whine.

A pup nurses for roughly a month, and
experiences prodigious growth gains on its
mother’s rich milk, usually quadrupling its
75-pound birth weight. But then, abruptly, a
pup’s life becomes a dog’s life as its mother
weans it, mates and returns to the sea.

he said. “This is a very susceptible
animal to rabies, and there have
been several cases documented.”

Elizabeth Connelly’s 7-month-
old son, Matthew, was with a baby-
sitter in Nevada in 1981 when he
was attacked. “She was outside
hanging up clothes,” she recalled.
“His face was chewed."

Connelly said, “He's got quite a
few scars. Still, we were lucky.
They’re around the hairline and are
not too prominent. They look like
little razor cuts."

Nobody knows what triggers
the attacks. Some experts theorize
that the ferrets are drawn to the
babies by the smell of milk on their
breath. Perhaps there is an explor-
atory nip by the ferret. The baby
responds by waving its arms and
crying and the ferret goes. berserk.

But Connelly said, “Matthew is
allergic to milk and was on a soy
formula. The attack was unpro-

fterward peOple talked in a

stunned way about how fast it

, happened. The baby is sleep

' W ing in the crib or playing on
the floor when suddenly the shrieks of
pain and terror begin. The pet ferret, its
normal mildness transformed into feral
ferocity, is ripping and tearing at the help-
less infant’s face with its sharp little teeth.

It‘s like a frenzy. Fifty, a hundred
bites or more inflicted and the face turned
to bloody hamburger before the animal is
pulled off. Ears chewed off in one in-
stance, a nose amputated in another. In’ all
cases, scars that will last a lifetime.

People in the business of spotting the
newest trends and fads have annointed
ferrets as “the pet of the ’80s,” the choice
of people who find dogs too noisy and cats
too dull. And who can wonder? Ferrets are
cute, busy little critters with appealing big
eyes and a playful manner.

Ferret sales are so phenomenal that
the nation's biggest breeder can satisfy

only 30 percent of the demand and is un- '

able to take on any new customers.

“Their popularity is just incredible,”
said Charles Morton of Willow Hill, Pa,
whose Path Valley Farm breeds and sells
upward of 15,000 ferrets a year. But few
who buy ferrets are aware of their dark
side, their potential for lightning-fast may-
hem.

The boom in ferrets comes despite the
fact it is illegal to own them without a

permit in California, the nation‘s most
populous state. Morton is in the forefront
of lobbying efforts to overturn California
laws forbidding ferret imports.

“We want them treated like dogs and
cats,” says Morton.

Ferret breeders have an implacable
foe in the state Department of Fish and
Game. “It all boils down to greed,” said
Jim Zobel, a patrol captain with the de~
partment. “They get $150 to $175 apiece
for their animals.”

The department doesn’t want ferrets
establishing a foothold in California, Zobel
said, “because we consider them a threat
to native wildlife, a threat to agriculture
and a threat to public safety.”

California authorities cite three cases

of ferrets attacking infants during the last

five years in Nevada, where the animals.

are legal. Sheriff‘s detective Sue Coffey,
who handles child abuse cases in Carson
City, looked into all three. They occurred
within 40 miles of each ‘other.

“111 Sparks in December of 1981, a“

child sleeping in his crib was attacked by a
pet ferret and received hundreds of bites
to the face, eyelids, ribs, even the back of
his knees The babysitter responded as fast
as she could, but the baby‘s face looked
like hamburger, ” Coffey said.

“In August of 1983 a 5month- old baby
in Washoc Valley was sleeping on a bed
and was attacked by a ferret and received
similar injuries.

“We had the last case last fall where a
pet ferret who was allowed to roam loose
attacked a 29-day-old baby girl sleeping in
a playpen at 2 o‘clock in the morning.
There were hundreds of bites all over her
face. It was if it had been eaten. Her nose
was amputated. Her dad was sleeping 10

feet away. They attack so fast, injury is
unpreventable.”

Plastic surgeon Richard Grace of Re-
no treated all three of the Nevada chil-
dren attacked. “Before I saw the first bite
wound I never heard of ferrets," he said.

In the most recent case, the prospect
for successful plastic surgery is not prom-
ising, Grace said. “The injuries were
frightening,” so horrible the victim doubt~
less will grow into Womanhood as “a social
recluse.”

Coffey queried law enforcement
agencies across the country and came up
with other cases where ferrets had at-
tacked infants. “A child in Colorado had
her ears chewed off, and a boy in Ohio
whose father bred ferrets nearly bled to
death when he was attacked. There is a

report of a child killed in London by a

ferret,” she said.

Coffey believes her informal survey
understates the problem. “I know we don’t
know about all of them.”

“There might be a dozen or fifteen
attacks since the 19705,” said Stanley
Diesch, a professor of veterinary medicine
at the University of Minnesota.

Worried that the ferret popularity
boom will add to the list of attacks on
babies, Diesch convinced the American
Veterinary Association four months ago to
issue a warning about the threat ferrets
pose to infants.

“Another concern is there is no ap-

From France, the ”airless Sphynx

One of the stranger breeds on hand at the International Cat
Show in New York last week was the bald Sphynx, a hundred of
which exist in a world full of hirsute felines.

According to New York magazine, Peter and Vicky Markstein.
Americans who imported a Sphynx named E. T. from France for the
show, had in mind the breed's true potential, “a feline alternative to
the Shar Pei, the yuppie pet of choice.” The Sphynx, however, does
have drawbacks:

I “He’s kind of ugly looking,” admits Peter Markstein.

I The Sphynx catches cold easily, bruises easily and eats twice as
much as a normal cat.

I Without

secretions, the
cat “gets sticky”
quickly, and

needs a bath once

a week or so.
“It’s like E. T.

Detection dogs track down termites _

Beagles’ keen sense of smell and hearing makes them excellent inspectors

By Teresa Carp
Special to The Christian Science Monitor

Robert Outman, a former police of-
ficer who once trained canines to de-
tect narcotics and explosives, has now
turned his dogs on termites.

He uses teams of beagles to ferret
out the pests that find dining on
wooden structures so delectable. Each
year, Americans across the country
spend more than $1 billion
to repair damage done by
termites.

Like those millions of
others, Mr. Outman found
out about this problem the
hard way. He bought a
home that was certified as
termite free. But in repairing
a squeaky step, he discov-
ered a thriving nest of the in
sects. He also discovered
that the original inspector
was not liable for damages.
Standard inspection con-
tracts exempt operators
from responsibility for
structural areas considered
inaccessible. Depending on
the type of construction. this
can range from 50 to 80 percent.

Instead of simply brooding over the
problem, Outman saw a market for a
better technology for pest inspection.
Applying his expertise as an animal
behaviorist, he conditioned and
trained male beagles to track down ter-
mites and carpenter ants. In 1979 he
set up shop with only a few beagles.

Business is now booming for
Outman's TADD Services Corpora-
tion of Belmont, Calif. (TADD stands
for termite and ant detection dogs).
Business volume doubles yearly. and

TADD leases 30 trained beagles to
pest-control companies in major cities
around the nation.

After extensive research, Outman

chose male beagles because they are.

tractable and intelligent; have an acute
sense of hearing and smell; and are
small enough to get into crawl spaces.
It's the dogs’ keen sense of smell and
hearing that alerts them to where the
termites are. The more termites there

TADDdog Wilson checks for drywood termites

are. the more active the beagles be-
come. “digging" excitedly at the pin-
pointed location. (They all get regular
pedicures to keep their nails rounded
so that no damage is done to indoor
floors.)

The program has undergone thor-
ough testing at Ohio State University,
where his dogs were certified as detec-
tors of both dry and subterranean ter-
mites. The canine crews are also reco ~
mixed by the National Pest Control
Association as a useful industrial tool.

and the results of the dogs’ findings
are admissible as evidence in litigation
over termite damage.

Outman is so confident in the abili-
ties of his four-legged inspectors that
each carries $1 million in errors-and-
omissions insurance. “They’re the
only animals in the world that have
malpractice insurance,” he says. To
date he has had only one claim.

Outman, who did
graduate work in animal be-
havior, was a member of the
dog handler and trainer unit
of the - San Mateo County
(Calif) Sheriff‘s Department
for 11 years. Because of this
law enforcement tie he was
eligible for a federal grant,
enabling him to study at the
military dog training school
at Lackland Air Force Base
in San Antonio. After this
training, he and his dog
Prince were two-time gold
medal winners in the dog pa-
trol competition at the Cali-
fornia state police Olympics.
In 1976, Outman was forced
into early retirement be-

cause of gunshot wounds received in
the line of duty.

Now that his current business is on
a firm footing, he and his corps of ca-
nine inspectors have become minor ce-
lebrities, appearing on television talk
shows and receiving fan mail.

But in the beginning. fans were few
and far between. The pest-control in-
dustry “initially treated the new con-
cept as a big joke," he recalls. ”We‘d
gone to a lot of trouble developing the

Wild in

The Streets

Changing environments have driven

some wildlife species into cities,

and many communities are welcoming

the animals wit/9 open arms. by Bruce W Most

ollowing their instinct, the pair

of Canada geese located their

nest as high as possible; 28 days
later they were rewarded with ﬁve
ﬂuffy goslings. There was just one
problem: The geese had to move to
the safety of a nearby lake — but the
nest was perched on the 10th-ﬂoor
balcony of the Community Federal
Bank building overlooking one of the
busiest intersections in St. Louis.

Fortunately the geese were under
the watchful eye of a Missouri urban
biologist. The animals were captured
and escorted to the lake. They liked
the service so well that the next spring
they returned to hatch another six
goslings.

Wildlife in cities is under the
watchful eye of many people these
days. Residents of Bronx, New York,
watch red-shouldered hawks snare
squirrels. Coyotes howl during con—
certs at the Hollywood Bowl in Los
Angeles. Gamblers in Atlantic City,
New Jersey, hope the peregrine fal-
cons roosting atop casinos are sym-
bols of good luck. Tucson, Arizona,

There is nothing new about wildlife
in cities. Gomer Jones, president of
the National Institute for Urban Wild-
life in Columbia, Maryland, points out:

“Most people, when you mention
urban wildlife, think of rats and cock-
roaches and the pests they see. They
don’t think of peregrine falcons, rac—
coons, deer — animals that would be
attracted to the city by the right kind
of habitat.”

Providing the right kind of habitat to
promote more diversity of desirable
species increasingly has become the
focus of public and private conserva-

citizens. Says Carrol Henderson, non—
game supervisor for Minnesota, which
has been working to enhance urban
wildlife, “What we’re seeing here is a
very slow but steady increase in spe-
cies that have proved to be adaptable.”
The species include deer, red foxes,
raccoons, and tundra swans.

tures have found the city too homey.
Several years ago wild turkeys were
introduced into the huge Swope Park
of Kansas City, Missouri, to the
delight of park users. The turkeys
adapted so well biologists now must
trap the excess for release elsewhere.

Why are these animals running wild
in the streets? Why are foxes living
under the bleachers of Yankee Sta-
dium and armadillos raiding gardens in
Miami Beach?

In part, people are becoming more
aware of their wildlife neighbors, many
of whom have always been there. State
conservation agencies are working
hard to destroy the myth that only rats
and roaches can live in cities. In fact,
nearly any animal, given the proper
food source, water, and cover, can
make a home among humans.

Aelred Geis, a federal-government
urban—wildlife specialist, says studies
show that the winter bird population
is better in many urban areas than in
undisturbed virgin woods because
there is ample food and fewer preda-
tors in cities.

Improved air and water quality have
made cities healthier places for ani-
mals. The decrease in use of pesti-
cides -— including DDT, which nearly
wiped out the peregrine falcon east of
the Mississippi — has contributed.
Paradoxically, urban sprawl, consum-
ing one million rural acres a year, is
forcing more wildlife onto city streets.

Coyotes live in Los Angeles because
the city took over their canyon homes
and because garbage cans provide
plenty of food.

What specialists in the ﬁeld ﬁnd most
exciting, however, are the efforts by
individuals and organizations to attract
more desirable species of wildlife.
Missouri citizens thought enough of the
idea that in 1976 they passed a one-
eighth of 1 percent sales-tax increase
to pay for a nongame wildlife preser-
vation program. Some of that money
has gone for “urban wild acres” —
parcels of 15 to 80 acres of wooded
or natural habitat. Explains St. Louis
urban-biologist David Tylka:

“We’re conserving these areas
for people to enjoy and for wildlife to
find habitat in as urbanization continues
to grow. We try to maintain as much
diversity and as many animals as
possible.”

A nongame income—tax check-off
system is used by several states to
fund urban programs. Among other
projects, Colorado’s active check-off
program is paying for improvement of
a I68-acre property called Crown Hill
Park. Though surrounded by 90,000
people within a 2-mile radius, the park
is a haven for foxes, muskrats, rac-
coons, skunks, birds, and ﬁsh.

The New York City chapter of the
Audubon Society is working on sev—
eral projects ranging from creating a

butterﬂy meadow to assuming man-

agement of 1,300 acres of urban
grassland owned by the National Park
Service. Explains Albert Appleton, the
chapter conservation chairman:

“There is a surprising amount of
natural habitat left in New York City,
which I think is true of most urban
areas. But the habitat is ecologically
unbalanced because of the stress of
human use and environmental condi-
tions. So we ﬁrst try to get the land
locked up that is not yet in protective
ownership; if it already is in public
ownership we try to get it properly
managed, which is just as important.”

One of the Audubon Society’s latest
victories was obtaining permission to
manage two important heron rooker-
ies on islands between Staten Island
and New Jersey, along with preserv-
ing a critical 30-acre feeding pond be-
tween the rookeries. The pond is lo—
cated next door to a toll—booth entrance
on Goethals Bridge.

While the preservation of critical
habitat such as wetlands and open
space is important, a surprising amount
can be provided with what is already
there. Federal urban—biologist Geis
says his home community of Colum—
bia, Maryland, is permitting hundreds
of acres of mowed open space to re-
vert to normal plant successions,
“which is vastly more beneﬁcial to
wildlife than maintained grass.”

Developers are cutting down fewer
trees and drainng or ﬁlling fewer wet-
lands. While this approach costs a de-
veloper more than bulldozing every-
thing to the ground, it also makes the
area more desirable and hence is bet-
ter for business.

City residents are doing their share,
too. People spend half a billion dollars
a year in birdseed and feeders.
Through programs by the National
Wildlife Federation and state conser—
vation agencies, people are planting
shrubs and providing water in their
yards to attract animals.

Some home owners even are going
to court for wildlife. Geis tells of two
Columbia families who lived near
storm-water catch basins that were put
in by developers during construction
phases. Though initially displeased
with the unsightly barns the families
grew attached to the waterfowl using
the waters. When the time came for
the developers to ﬁll the basins, the
families went to court to stop them.
Several such basins not only have been

preserved but also improved in the
Columbia area and today are home to
frogs, herons, egrets, and muskrats.
Selling the public on the value of ur—
ban wildlife, say proponents, is less a
challenge than selling conservation
agencies that traditionally are con-
cerned with game animals and endan—
gered species. “It’s a lot easier to get
[conservation] people excited about
timber wolves and grizzly bears,” says
Henderson. Geis chuckles when talk—
ing about the Maine biologist who la-
mented that in the winter the only birds
he could ﬁnd were in communities —
“as if there is something immoral about
having wildlife live in cities,” says Geis.
These new urban animals are not
always perfect neighbors. Deer cause
auto accidents, geese foul golf courses,
woodpeckers damage homes, pere-
grine falcons ﬂy through ofﬁce win-
dows (pigeon lovers hate them for
feasting on their pets), and coyotes in
Los Angeles bite children and kill pets.
Beavers along the South Platte River‘
in downtown Denver are devouring the
very trees planted to attract them back

- in the ﬁrst place. So many raccoons,

some of them rabid, have inﬁltrated
the Washington, DC, area that the
police department of one county has
shoot-on-sight orders.

Urban biologists contend that such
incidents mean we need much more
research in determining how animals
survive in cities and how best to man—
age them. Pest birds, for instance, can
be reduced and more desirable spe-
cies attracted through better architec—
ture, says Geis. Reestablishing an
ecological balance is critical, too, since
lack of predators causes much of the
imbalance. “Management is our next
step,” says Jones.

Perhaps most important is that
wildlife in urban areas is a barometer
of the quality of the environment. A
city ﬁlled with pigeons and rats but no
hawks and trumpeter swans “means
we really blew it,” says Henderson.

Clean air, clean water, lots of trees
and shrubs are as desirable to humans
as they are to wildlife. If a city is not
suitable for most wildlife, reason ur-
ban specialists, it cannot be a very ﬁt
place for people. \‘

Lo I do not agree.

My grandfather was a trapper. I can
still remember him telling us about the
animals waiting for hours in the grip of
cruel steel legholding traps, dying in
agony. He did not trap for very long,
knowing what pain he caused the animals.

Non-target animals are also victimized
by leghold traps -— which indiscrimi-
nately capture animal that stumbles
into them. These trash animals, according
to Department of Interior figures, consti-
tute as much as 67 percent of the total
catch, and include domestic animals such
as dogs and cats.

Trapping is not a sound wildlife man-
agement tool that prevents over-popula-
tion, disease, crop damage, and habitat
destruction.

0n the contrary, it is an ecologically
destructive practice which disrupts
predator-prey relations, family units, and
weakens genetic stock and resistance to
disease by taking healthy and unhealthy
individuals indiscriminately. It actually
contributes i: e problems it claims to
solve by stimulating birth rates.

,, The U.S. Coast Guard investigated
yesterday the source of three mysteri-
ous oil spills that injured about 300 sea-
birds along the Northern California
coast.

Just as a two-mile-long oil slick spotted

“west of Point Ano Nuevo on Saturday began
°'breaking up into a thin sheen, Coast Guard
Adfficiais discovered two new, but smaller, oil

slicks.
Surveying the area by helicopter, investi-

.5 gators spotted an oil slick eight miles west-of
. the Golden Gate Bridge, measuring 200 yards
“in diameter. They also found oil globules col-

lected in a small area near Pescadero Point,
about 20 miles south of San Francisco.

Much of the oil was pushed toward the

coastline this weekend by raging 20foot

waves. The unusually high waves formed

closed beaches, capsized boats and apparently
killed a college student who was swept from a
jetty near Santa Cruz. -

Investigators speculated that some of the
oil spilled into the ocean might have originat-

before oil-coated seabirds began appearing

onshore.

originated from the same source because sam-

“It's almost like a fingerprint,” he said.

ered seabirds.

Polluted seas are taking an especially
heavy toll on a squatty blackand-white bird
known officially as the common murre but
sometimes dubbed the California penguin,
said Tim Cochran at the Native Animal Re-
serve in Santa Cruz.

Other seabirds forced to shore included
grebes, scoter ducks, common loons and auk-
lets, said Mary Langenberg, a wildlife techni-
cian at the Peninsula Humane Society in San
Mateo.

Wildlife workers at the humane society
center began treating 210 injured birds on
Saturday and by yesterday another 100 birds
were brought to .the shelter in cardboard box-
es, Langenberg said.

Most of the birds, which rarely visit the
shore, were coated by oil when they dove for
food, Cochran said.

Oil destroys the birds’ waterproofing and
makes it difficult for them to survive.

“They begin to get hypothermia and
drown so they immediately go to shore,” he
said. “For every bird that makes it to shore
another 10 drowned out there.” A small boat
advisory remained in effect yesterday for
crafts along the Northern California coast-
line, said National Weather Service forecaster
Ed Clark.

Large waves, which reached up to 25 feet
Saturday, had dropped back to 11 feet yester-
day from Monterey Bay northward to San
Francisco, he said.

The weather service issued a high surf
warning, however, for the northern and cen-
tral California coast saying large that ocean
swells ranging from 10 feet to 17 feet could be
expected.

Rough seas closed a surfing competition
near Santa Cruz, where a college student ap-

Will birds of a feather be able to stay together?

By DAVID SZYMANSKI
Tribune Staff Writer

A pair of bird lovers, who may be forced to

give up their hobby to comply with a Tampa ,

code, have prompted the city to rewrite a regu-
lation barring exotic birds.

David Hosley and his wife, Michelle Gins-
burg, of 2903 Okara Road -- which borders Bu-
Isch Gardens to the west —— own $15,000 worth of

rare birds: 10 macaws, a parrot and a cockatoo. .

The birds are illegal to own without a city
barnyard permit, and that is impossible to ob-
tain because the closeness of the homes and the
icomplaints from one neighbor violate the condi-
Ttions of such a permit.

Even though the code is being rewritten, the

couple sees no alternative but to fight the city in ,

court.

“I don’t think the constitutional issues were

raised in a proper manner,” said Diana Allen,
the couple’s attorney, who specializes in city
codes.
' Friday in County Court, she won her clients
a retrial set for Feb. 21 and a stay on Ginsburg’s
jprobation, which she received at a non-jury trial
on Jan. 13.

At the Jan. 13 trial, County Court Judge Ro-
bert H. Bonanno told the couple they had 60
days to comply and placed Ginsburg on proba-
;tion for violating the code.

Ginsburg was cited because she was home

when an officer from the city’s standards and
enforcement department found her guilty of
-“harboring exotic birds.”
, Bonanno told the couple they could get rid of
"the birds, build an extension on their home to
keep the birds inside or get a permit, Hosley
said. However, Hosley later learned from a city
housing official that even putting the birds in-
side couldn’t meet the code.

City attorneys agreed the code implies that
keeping the birds inside will not satisfy the stat-
ute.

The case is further complicated by a deci-
sion by County Court Judge Susan Bucklew in
March that found Ginsburg not guilty. Bucklew
asked Ginsburg to get a permit, which Ginsburg
found to be impossible because the conditions of

worth of rare birds.

the permit could not be met.

After further complaints from neighbors,
Ginsburg went to court 10 months later and Bo-
nanno found her guilty.

Allen said she will try to argue that the case .

be dismissed because of .a lack of due process
and equal protection under the law. City attor-
neys also agreed with her description of the
code as being “vague and overly broad.”

Now the code is being rewritten to allow pets
to be kept indoors.

“As an area becomes more urbanized, the
idea is to keep the animals a little further
away,” explained City Attorney Martin Hernan-
dez. “It’s (the code) kind of ridulous in a way. I
think it’s really ridiculous.

“The constitutionality of the code is weak,
but there is a better defense (for Ginsburg)
estoppel,” Hernandez noted.

Estoppel is a changed judgment made on a
previous verdict.

Assistant City Attorney Thomas Saunders is

researching and rewriting the code. In its new
form, which will have to be passed by the City
Council, the code will place a limit on decibels
and odor from pets, kept inside or outside.

A city official would measure both odor and
sound before citing an individual, Saunders ex-
plained.

The Hosleys used to own 300 birds on a 10-
acre farm in Gainesville, but m0ved to Tampa
in October 1984 and brought only the 12 birds.
They moved to Florida three years ago, and
their interest in learning more about rare birds
— 90 percent which migrate through the state
-— was one main force that brought them here.

Some of their birds are extinct or will be,
Hosley noted. He and his wife even do minor
veterinary work on their pets.

According to the code, any animal other
than a dog, cat or homing pigeon cannot be kept
less than 200 feet from. the property of another
person without a city permit.

In addition, everyone living within 500 feet
of the animals must sign a consent form.

Next-door neighbor Henry Goff, 66, of 2901
Okara Road, retired from the Air Force, said he
called the city because of the noise of the birds
at dawn and dusk or whenever he runs his gas-
powered lawn mower near the 6-foot wooden
fence separating him from the Hosley’s back-
yard birdhouse.

“They will holler from the crack of dawn till
about 10 o’clock,” Goff said. “On a cloudy day
they’ll squawk all day long swawk, swawk,
swawk. They make life unbearable.”

However, other neighbors do not seemed to
be bothered by the birds in the neighborhood.

“We’ve gotten used to them (the birds),”
said Karen Kalvin, whose home shares the op-
posite fence with the Hosleys. “In any city you
get accustomed to the sounds around you.”

Hosley and Ginsburg keep the birds in a
large cage and a separate roofed house. The
birdhouse is enclosed on three sides by metal
and another by screen. They are fed at sunrise
and sundown and will scream only briefly at
feeding time, Hosley said.

However, Goff said the birds disturb him
and other neighbors who have complained to
him and not the city.

Arrests Don’ t Deter Animal Lover

By Jo Mannies '
Of the Post-Dispatch Stall

Gloria Sutter once stopped her

van on the side of the highway to
give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
to an injured dog. The animal died,
and Sutter wept over the loss.
Sutter’s strong belief in the value
of life for all animals is at the cen'
ter of her dispute with Franklin
County officials and the Humane

Society of Missouri. .

For the second time in less than
two years, she has been arrested
for having too many animals at her
sanctuary in Franklin County. She
was released on bond soon after the
arrest.

Sutter’s supporters and critics
agree that the 'dispute centers on
her refusal to turn away or destroy
animals to control the population.

Mh
couple who visited Sutter’s farm seeking a
house pet on Friday.

Most of the animals were aban-
doned or injured, brought to her
sanctuary because Franklin County
has no public animal shelter.

The Humane Society and Franklin
County contend that the animals re-
side in crowded and sometimes un-
sanitary conditions.

But Don Anthony, general manager
for the Humane Society, conceded
that the 770 animals appeared to be
healthy and well-fed. After Sutter was
arrested Wednesday, Anthony said,
“Our veterinarian said, ‘I don’t think
there’s 15 animals that need to be
destroyed in this whole place.’ ”

Nevertheless, Anthony said Sutter
must deal with the problem of

. crowding.

“I look at a cage as a way to turn
over animals,” he said. “If you don’t
destroy, you either turn them away as
some groups do or you let them build
up and build up until you have too
many — and that’s what Gloria did.”

. Sutter says she is trying to cooper-
ate with authorities. But she says she
also lives in fear of a repeat of the
events of one day in June 1984.

That’s when she helplessly watched
a Humane Society veterinarian de-
stroy 254 of her animals because of
allegations of unsanitary and over-
crowded conditions at the sanctuary.

“Animals were dragged out of their
cages screaming -— I’ll hear those
screams the rest of my life,” Sutter
said.

“I can still see my friends’ eyes
staring up at me from the pile of
corpses.”

Anthony said he won’t forget that
day either. “The vet who was out
there will probably never get over
what she had to do,” Anthony said. “It
was a real trauma for her.”

Gloria Sutter says she never
planned to turn her lifelong love for
animals into a 24~hour-, all-consuming
profession. And she appears uncom-
fortable with one supporter’s descrip-
tion of her as “the Mother Theresa
or animals.”

Sutter, 48, cares for 770 animals
,— hundreds of dogs, dozens of cats,
13 horses and ponies, two pigs and
a rooster —-— on her 23-acre site
near St. Clair, about 45 miles south-
west of St. Louis.

ly with her own money and that of

, “I don’t want to try and do every-

to be doing it.”

She estimates that she spends more
than $8,000 each month to care for
her animals and to pay her 10 em-
ployees. At least $6,000-of that goes
for pet food and cat litter. Her month-
ly veterinary bills are at least $500.

Sutter pays the bills largely
through the generosity of her father,
Norman Sutter, a prominent lawyer.
He is the major benefactor, and
treasurer, of the non-profit corpora-
tion that provides the money for Glo-

ria Sutter’s operation, which is called
Vanovia Animal Sanctuary. She also
accepts whatever donations she can
get.

When her family sold 'a small man-
ufacturing firm it owned in Fenton
this summer, Sutter used her share of
the proceeds to pay for a large con-
crete animal kennel and other need-
ed improvements. ‘ P

Sutter’s sanctuary is hidden in the
woods. It is off an unmarked, rocky
road that runs close to Interstate 44.

“There’s a lot of love that’s gone
into this place,” Sutter said Friday as
she scanned her animal-filled proper-
ty. “These are old friends of mine
that will be taken away.”

Dressed in boots and work clothes,
her hair disheveled, Sutter looks the
part of an earthy outdoorswoman.
She lives in a trailer that is parked on
the site.

The ranch-style house has been
taken over by cats and what she
terms “house dogs” -— canines that
she believes are unsuited for the ken-
nels or outdoor cages that serve as
quarters for most of the other dogs.
Each of the outdoor cages has an at-
tached small wooden house to shelter
the dogs from the cold.

Sutter is a soft-spoken woman who
clearly prefers talking about animals
to discussing herself. But she con-
cedes that her upbringing was quite
different from the rustic life she now
leads.

She grew up in University City,
graduated from the public high
school and attended Washington Uni-
versity for a year. She also showed
horses. In 1957, 1958 and 1960, Sutter
rode Stonewall’s Enchanted Lady to
the state championship in the 5-gait-
ed horse category, according to her
father. '

Sutter said she had worked as a
department store detective for 10
years and also was active as a volun-
teer with animal protection groups in
Crestwood.

As she got more involved with anio
mals, Sutter moved out of St. Louis
County because of municipal and
county restrictions on the number of
animals she could keep.

For several years, she kept animals
at a family owned site in Villa Ridge.
The menagerie reportedly numbered
in the hundreds before she bought the
St. Clair property about five years
ago.

main problems is in keeping the ani-
mal quarters clean and free of feces.
She has difficulty keeping workers
because “cleaning up after defecat-
ing dogs is frustrating” and a never-
ending job, particularly for 770 ani-
mals, she said.

In the past month, 35 workers have
started on the job; less than one-third
remain.

All of the animals have names. Sut-
ter also remembers how every ani-

. mal she ever cared for ended up in

her hands.

She recalls a young dog that was
the sole survivor of a litter of 12 pup-
pies left abandoned in a trailer court.
The other puppies had been clubbed
to death by residents or killed during
“bow-and-arrow target practice.” The
dog had managed to survive such
abuse, including an arrow wound.

Sutter got the dog in her care with
the aid of a nearby restaurant worker

' who fed the animal each day.

She says her collection of animals
started as she came more aware of
the “active abuse”- that some people
vent on animals. “I’ve seen dogs with
their eyes shot out. And cats that have
been used for fish bait — a wire is
strung through their chest and they
are dipped in the water to attract
fish.”

Sutter acknowledges that one of
her main problems is that she has

.. trouble refusing anyone who brings in

an abandoned or hurt animal.

Sutter often is alerted about injured
animals lying on the side of Franklin

County roads. So she goes out in a

to a vet to see if it can be treated.

“It’s terribly hard to turn a dog

‘ away when they’re looking at you,”

Sutter said Friday. “I know what’s
going to happen to it if I turn it
away.” .

The latest court agreement calls
for Sutter to get rid of at least 50
animals a week. She is worried that
she will not get enough adopted. But
even so, Sutter is selective about pro-
spective adoptive “parents”.

In a five-hour period Friday, she
allowed only two dogs to be adopted.
She grilled the prospective owners ——

and made a few angry — with ques-
tions designed to discern their affec-
tion and care for animals. One of her
requirements for dog owners is that
they have a fenced-in yard.

Sutter also requires that the ani-
mals be neutered within a week. Al-
though she makes exceptions for
some people who want to use their
own vets, Sutter prefers to charge $25
for each animal to have it neutered
by her own vet before the animal
goes to its new home. The money also
pays for shots and deworming.

She wryly notes that many of the
animals destroyed in June 1984 “still
had their stitches” from neutering op-
erations.

For 10 years, Sutter was a vegetari-
an. But she says she briefly changed
her eating habits —and her whole
way of life —- after the 254 animals
were killed.

“I thought maybe everybody was
right and I wrong, that maybe I was
evnl,” Sutter said. But now she is go-
ing back to her original thinking. She
Is returning to being a vegetarian.

“I can’t tell someone else not to
euthanize animals,” Sutter said. “I
can’t quarrel with others’ views. But I
can put all my heart and my money '
into my idea of how animals should
be maintained.”

ﬁﬁ'ﬁ'

Animal protection groups and
Franklin County officials concede
that cases such as Gloria Sutter arise

because of the lack of public animal
shelters. But there the agreement
ends.

Under state law, fourth-class coun-
ties such as Franklin have no author-
ity to set up a tax-supported operation
to deal with animal control. '

That authority is given only to mu-
nicipalities, to first-class counties
such as St. Louis and St. Charles, and
selected second-class counties.

County officials note that voters re-
jected a proposal to set up a County
Health Department, which could deal
with some animal issues.

Prosecuting Attorney Walter A.
Murray said he was unconvinced that
government needed to handle the is-
sue. “Franklin County is limited in its
own finances,” he said.

Private groups could set up a coun-
ty shelter. But Franklin County offi-
cials and several residents who help
animals said last week that it was
difficult to find enough money in ru-
ral counties for a private shelter.

“I volunteered our 10 acres to the
Humane Society to get it started,”
said Ann Erickson of St. Clair. “But
interest just fizzled out. There are not
enough concerned citizens in Frank-
lin County."

Ann Gonnerman, head of the Na-
tional Society For The Protection Of
Animals, based in Kansas City, says
part of the problem is the lack of
cooperation among animal protection
groups. Such cooperation could work
to change the state law to require all

counties to set up animal shelters, she
said. -

' The other stumbling block, Gon-
nerman said, are hunters who oppose
any sort of regulations governing vac-
cinations or other care for their dogs.

Anthony, of the state Humane Soci-
ety, blames the large number of com-

,mercial kennels in Missouri.

Efforts to get animal protection
bills through the Legislature are
killed every year, Anthony said. “It’s
frustrating, I’ll tell you that.”

Anthony would like an animal wel-
fare statute such as that in Illinois,
which monitors all animal kennels
and shelters. It’s “a beautiful law,” he
said.

Officials have concluded that there
there is no immediate way to set up
alternatives in rural Missouri areas to
private sanctuaries operated by peo-
ple such as Sutter.

Murray says his main concern now
is in forcing Sutter to reduce the pop-
ulation in her sanctuary.

A reduction, Anthony believes,
would require “euthanasia for a num-
ber of animals. . . . It will improve the
quality of life for those left out
there.”

Murray notes that Sutter agreed 18

' months ago to keep no more than 250
animals. He says Franklin County will
more closely monitor her sanctuary
operations in the future.

But referring to Sutter’s population
problem, Murray said: “I can’t prom-
ise that it won’t happen again.”

Need For Improved Animal Care

' “I don’t want to try and do eve ’
job. .But I seem. to be doing it.”rSltt))oggig
Gloria Sutter recently to Post-Dispatch re-
porter Jo Mannies when talking about her
arrest for possible violations of animal pro-
tection laws in Missouri. Ms. Sutter was
arrested while tending about 770 animals
on a 23-acre place near St. Clair. She is
free on bail from her second arrest in less
than two years on similar charges.
A natural impulse is to feel sympathy for
Ms. Sutter for trying to care for the stray
bedraggled and unwanted creatures whose
paths cross hers. A century ago, that might
be a proper response. Today, mere sympa-
thy tsn’t‘sufficient. Reports on her Vanovia
shelter indicate that the animals were
well-fed and kept humanely, considering
the Circumstances. Even so, responsible
Citizens must go beyond seeing Ms. Sutter
as a latter-day St. Francis of Assisi.
Had she not given the animals shelter,

most of them would have died of starvation
- or neglect and-many would be wandering
the countryside in deplorable condition.
One may question, or criticize, her judg-
ment in taking in so many, but it is impossi-
ble to do so without assigning a principal
share of the blame to uncaring people who
dump unwanted pets and the irresponsible
ones who do not neuter their pets.
Fortunately, Missouri now has a fairly

strong animal protection law that sets lim-
its on conditions of overcrowding and sani-
tation. What must follow is for the law to
be adjusted so that funds can be used to
provnde decent protection and euthanasia
(when necessary) for animals. Ms. Sutter
may be providing a kind of half-way house

for neglected animals, but she should nei-

therbe expected nor allowed to do this

missmn alone. Local and state govern-
ments should provide the means to relieve
her and those like her of their burden.

Caring For Unwanted Pets

For the second time in less than two years
we have seen the photographs and read the
story of Gloria Sutter and her Vanovia Ani-
mal Sanctuary, which is obviously her whole
life. The dedication of this woman who gives
24 hours of every day in an attempt to feed,
house and provide veterinary care for more
than 700 dogs, cats, horses, etc., is beyond
the comprehension of most of us. Not only
the amount of time spent but the staggering
cost to provide this care show Gloria Sutter
to be a person driven to sacrifice her person-

al comfort to be able to carry out her

mission. .

It seems unjust that a person trying so
’ desperately to give
these animals a decent

letters life becomes the de-

ﬁ fendant, while those
0m who cruelly dump ani-

mals in the Franklin
the

 

 

 

and produce more un-
wanted animals face
no charges. The voters of Franklin County
have rejected a proposal to set up a tax-
supported operation to deal with animal
control. Why is it not possible to change
state law to require all counties to set up
animal shelters, especially in those areas
that so obviously have serious problems?

It is my understanding that Vanovia is a
certified animal sanctuary and that dona-
tions or gifts to it would be tax-deductible.
And why is it not possible to let the people

who care help Gloria Sutter through some

sort of fund-raising effort? I find it hard to
believe that there aren’t people who would
be willing to send donations to help her
improve her facility and the care she is
, able to provide. .

Margie L. Theiss
Crestwood .

I am writing in regard to the Sutter case in
St. Clair. This woman is doing the best she
can for abandoned and unwanted animals
and a far better job than the Humane Society
is doing.

She gives her animals the best of food and
all they want. In the winter it is hard to scoop
the poop, as it freezes to the ground and the
water does, too. I have beer. to many shelters
that looked unclean because animals don’t
have any certain time they do their business,
and unless there is plenty of helpyou can’t
clean the cages, pens or runs until you can
get to them. ~

The Humane Society puts its animals to
sleep in a decompression chamber and that
means they fight each other as they suffo-
cate, trying to get air. Do you think that is
humane? I think the Humane Society should
clean up its own act.

Here we go again. A replay at Vanovia, but t

not an instant replay. It took two years for
this woman to get approximately 500 ani-
mals over the limit the Humane Society got a

court to set for her. Now we will begin to
take sides and hear who is to blame. Where
does the fault lie? Who’s the bad guy? Ms.
Sutter, who kept taking in animals because
she didn’t believe in euthanasia? Or the Hu-
mane Society, which may get a court to or-
der that a majority of the animals be put to
sleep?

Let’s be completely objective and realistic:

Gloria Sutter did not magically pull any of

those cats and dogs out of a hat to get the
numbers she has. And who in their right
mind thinks anyone who works at the Hu-
mane Society or in any form of humane
work wants to kill an animal?

So who’s to blame when there is any
amount of homeless animals, even one? Ev-
eryone will be so busy abhorring the condi-
tions at Vanovia or criticizing the Humane
Society for destroying animals that the real
culprits will be overlooked. It took a lot of
people to make this tragedy possible again:
Individual pet owners who allow their ani-
mals to breed, for whatever misguided rea-
son, are the people who create Vanovias.
And let’s not forget to give fair billing to
those pet owners who dump their animals
hoping someone else will assume their moral
responsibility.

The simplest answer is the neutering and
spaying of pets and taking the unwanteds to
a local humane shelter. They are certainly
worth the time, car gas and trouble for that.
This is the only way to prevent Vanovias. It’s
also your responsibility as a pet owner!

iew land-use plan will benefit woodpeckers

GAINESVILLE (AP) —- Access to Florida’s na-
tional forests by the state’s timber industry will be
limited under a revised land-use plan designed to
give the Red Cockaded Woodpecker more room
to roam.

Revisions to the US Forest Service’s Land
and Resource Management Plan call for less tim-
ber harvesting to protect the habitat of the endan-
gered woodpecker, said Assistant Forest Supervi-
sor Ray Mason.

“We tried to come up with a balanced pro-
gram sensitive to everybody’s needs, but that’s a
hard pie to slice to please everybody,” Mason
said. . ‘
The forest service’s plan determines how 1.1
million acres of Florida’s national forest lands
will be divided among lumber companies, wild-
life, recreational and wilderness areas.

The forest service plans to set aside about
87,000 acres in loo-acre sites scattered around the
forests for the endangered woodpecker. Existing
woodpecker colonies will be protected, and new
habitats for existing and expanding woodpecker
populations will be designated.

Mason said Florida’s master plan, which was
released Jan. 17, took four years of intensive
work. “It’s a much stronger plan now, from an en-
vironmental standpoint,” he said. _

Timber harvests under the plan will be held at

100 million board feet per year during the rest of
the decade, escalating to a proposed 115 million
board feet per year during the 19905.

Mason said 208 million board feet per year
could be harvestedeach year from the forests
without harming the forest’s other resources.
That’s more than twice what is currently being
harvested.

Industry officials don’t like the plan.

“(It) turns the whole forest over to the envi-
ronmentalists,” said William Carroll Lamb, vice
president of the Florida Forestry Association, rep-
resenting timber industry landowners and suppli-
ers “They got all they want and we got nothing we
wanted.” . .

Lamb’s sentiments were echoed by Herb
McRae, the association’s assistant executive vice
president. ‘

~ “We aren’t too happy about (the plan,)”
McRae said. “They underestimated what the de-
mand for timber products would be. A lot of able
people expanded and built new (timber) mill ca-
pacities to handle an additional 340 million board
feet per year since 1980, figuring there would be a
demand —- and a supply —- for that resource.”

McRae said he supports the idea of multiple
uses of forests, “but we don’t want to become na-
tional parks. Our basic concern is that they’re get-
ting away from the basic idea for which national

He said the plan would hurt some Panhandle

National Forest timber sales produced $8.86
million in 1984, a quarter of which was shared by
county governments based on the number of
acres harvested in each county.

John Simon, a Gainesville trustee of the Flor-

ida Defenders of the Environment, said many of

the suggestions his organization made concerning
the plan’s draft were incorporated into the final
plan.

“We thought not enough emphasis was placed
on wildlife and maintenance of natural habitats,
and too much was placed on timber harvesting,”
Simon said. “I’m happy to see the changes they
did make, changes toward a more environmen-
tally sensitive direction.”

The plan will be implemented 30 days after
the release date, barring any justified appeal
being filed with the US. Forest Service’s regional
office in Atlanta.

the Panhandle.

For Endangered Species, Hunters Play a Deadly Role

 

To the Editor:

“The Danger Is to All Species”
(editorial, Jan. 28) was commend-
able in its support for the renewal of
.the Endangered Species Act of 1972.
By naming environmental pollution,
you were correct in pinpointing one
reason why so many animals and
plants have been or are about to be
rendered extinct. However, the con-
comitant to this widespread pollution
is the rampant rape of wildlife by
hunters.

In fact, the Endangered Species
_ Act specifically lists hunting as a
major cause for the destruction of
wildlife and wilderness. However,
hunting interest groups perpetuate
the myth that hunters are an environ-
mentally minded group, when in fact,
' nothing can be further from truth.
Hunters are motivated by a trophy-
collection mentality (subsistence
hunting accounts for only 2 percent of
all hunting in the United States), and
. thus the primary targets are the
males of the species.

In addition to hunters seeking the
males as trophies, the female popula~
tions of those species are allowed to
proliferate (usually as part of govern-
mental “management”
which unnaturally increases the popu-
lation. This leads to the destruction of
the entire ecosystem because the land
base that supports the species is de-
' strayed by the overpopulation of some
species (those that the hunters desire
as trophies) and the underpopulation
of small animals and birds that are
destroyed by hunters in huge num-
bers. In’tjime, the delicate balance of
nature is upset, and large areas of
land become barren. '

‘ Another favorite myth of hunters is
that they are natural predators who
regulate the populations of wildlife by
culling the weak and diseased. In na-
ture, predators kill only to eat and al-
ways seek to kill the weakest of the

herd, as they are easiest to capture.
In this way, the species is culled of the

. weak and diseased and made strong-

er. Hunters, on the other hand, kill the
strongest andhealthiest members of
a species because these provide the
best “trophy.” This artificial'culling
of the healthy members of the spe-
cies, along with the unnatural over-
abundance of females, leads to the’
eventual destruction of the species. .
An example is the black grizzly of
western Pennsylvania, now extinct

' for these reasons.

The only long-range solution to the
problem of endangered species is for
Congress to enact stricter controls on
polluters such as hunters, who though
small in number, wield great influ-
ence in Congress through their pres-
sure groups. When taxpayers demand
that these groups (the National Rifle
Association, the National Wildlife
Federation, etc.) be given less control

over the priorities Congress sets in

 

policy). ' "

Wildlife Deception
To the Editor:

New York State, through its De-
partment of Environmental Conser-
vation, is asking the taxpayer to
“give a gift for wildlife” on the state
income-tax form. To maximize con-
tributions via this simple tax check-
off program, the department is
spending $130,000 on a slick, decep-
tive ad campaign, depicting happy
animals in the wild. Nowhere are
there any pictures or accounts of
wildlife shot, wounded or trapped.

Consequently, as documented in a
1984 Cornell University study, fully 85
percent of contributors believe that
their donations are used for the pro-
tection of wildlife. Yet the State Fi-
nance Law allows this money to be

_. spent “for the protection of public.
‘, .. hunting and shooting.” Worse, mem-

bers of the advisory council who
determine the use of this revenue,
must by law hold 'valid hunting, trap-
ping and fishing licenses. As a result,

and unbeknown to the well-meaning

taxpayers, a good portion of their
,“gift for wildlife” is spent on projects
benefiting hunters and trappers.

Those who do not wish to support.

such projects should take these facts
into account before checking off such
a donation on their state tax form.
They should also write to their repre-
sentative in the, State Assembly to
support the Connor-Lafayette bill, A.

fair situation. DORIS PRIMACK

Animals Needed for Preventive Medicine AISO

In her response to Dr. Ray Olsson’s
Dec. 8 letter defending the use of animals
in medical research, Bina Robinson
makes some important points which help
clarify the necessity for the use of ani-
mals in some health-related research.

Robinson’s idea of effective medical
‘investigation is harmless epidemiological
and clinical studies that can pinpoint the
causes of human diseases.

However, epidemiological and clinical
studies cannot pinpoint the causes of
human diseases, only controlled experi-
mental studies can do that.

What uncontrolled observational stud-
ies can do is establish that one event is re-
lated to another. It cannot show that one
causes the other, just as it cannot show
that the other causes the one. In fact, it
may be that both-are caused by a third
event

Over the past few years, for example,
epidemiological studies have shown that
people with high blood pressure consume
less calcium than people with normal
blood pressure. Is a low calcium intake.
therefore, a cause of hypertension? Or
does the hypertensive individual uncon-
sciously choose less calcium since it
causes constriction of the blood vessels
and the body is attempting to compensate
for the disorder? Or doesrthere just hap-
pen to be less calcium in the foods which
promote hypertension?

animal rights in a Jan. 11 letter written by
Charles Griswold Jr.

His attack on those who extend their
concern to all creatures that inhabit this
earth was interesting, not just because of
the innuendoes that Associate Professor

Griswold used to illustrate his point of .

view, but because of the facts that he con-
veniently omitted. .

Griswold mentioned that some mem-
bers of the Animal Liberation Front 113::
broken the law. '

He didn’t include the fact that three
examples of this lawbreaking at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, the City of H fie
Medical Center, Calif, and the University
of California, Riverside campus, have re-
sulted in the closing of the first two of
these facilities, with the third presently
being charged with animal mistreatment.

Appropriately, a large part of the
documentation that led to the closing of
the University of Pennsylvania research
center were tapes that had been made by
the researchers themselves.

Only experimental studies can answer
those questions. Epidemiological and
clinical studies can give invaluable clues
about where to look for causes, but it can-
not demonstrate them. Thirty years of
public argument about the role of dietary
sodium in hypertension or the role of die-
tary cholesterol in coronary artery dis-
ease should have made that clear.

Ms. Robinson’s point about an ounce
of prevention being worth a pound of cure
is well taken. However, the fact remains

that for several of the most important dis-
eases, the causes remain unknown. Re-
search with animals is necessary to un-
derstand their origins.

By condemning the proper use of ani-
mals in research, she seems to contradict
her own stated preference for preventing
rather than curing disease by outlawing
the primary means for understanding the
biological principles involved.

.The animal rights group made their
pomt by cold, hard, documented facts, not
by moral argument alone.

He also failed to mention that unlike
the research community, the animal
rights position is not self-seeking, but
strives to support not only animal rights
but the public welfare.

The contention that unlimited animal
research could save your life or save you
from an excruciating disease ignores the
fact that if the taxpayer money was not
squandered on redundant animal tests
this country might have concentrated on
developing alternate testing methods and
advance toward preventive medicine.

Since those who espouse animal rights .
do so because of their ethical and moral
beliefs they are called, by the writer, “ab-
surd!’ ‘

He comments disparagingly about mi-
croscopic organisms and plants and ques-
tions whether advocates of animal right

feel the same fondness for them. , ’99,

It is obvious that he is unawa 4’6‘
the animal rights and environn\

causes have beemmerging for some time.

If he had been observing, instead of

attacking, the letter writer would have
noted that the same people who try to pro-
tect the rights of animals are also fighting
for clean Water and pure air.
