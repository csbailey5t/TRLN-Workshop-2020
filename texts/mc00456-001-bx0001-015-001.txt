Animals in War Tim’e

Maybe you are thinking that in war 5‘

time you have so many calls on you
* for assistance that you cannot help the * '

R.S.P.C.A.

In that case DO, PLEASE, consider
A FEW FACTS :—

Cruelty to animals, caused by ignorance, or carelessness, or
sheer brutality, does not cease because we are at war.

 

That is not a vague statement ; its truth has been proved. Every
day since the outbreak of war R.S.P.C.A. Inspectors have had
to warn people about the ill—treatment of animals and to give
them sound advice and practical help. Numbers of serious
cases of cruelty have been reported to R.S.P.C.A. Headquarters.

Human beings can voice their grievances; ill—used animals
cannot complain. People who ill—treat animals have to be
cautioned and advised and, if necessary, prosecuted ; otherwise
they will continue to illrtreat their animals. All R.S.P.C.A.
Inspectors are experts on animals ; they know how to prevent
cruelty.

If the R.S.P.C.A., through lack. of support, were compelled to
withdraw their inspectors numbers of cases of cruelty to animals
and birds would not be detected.

Such a state of things is unthinkable and, therefore, the work
of the Inspectors MUST go on ; only in this way can “ fair play
for animals” be made a CERTAINTY.

Your gift will go towards the maintenance of the Inspector in this
district; by giving you will be doing all you can do for those who

can do nothing for themselves—ill—used animals.

THEY PLEAD FOR YOUR HELP.

ARE THEY T0. PLEAD IN VAIN?
