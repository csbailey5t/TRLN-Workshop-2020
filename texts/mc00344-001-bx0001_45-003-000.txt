AID DOGS 0

The Nanhall Pet Spa and Pet Center in
Greensboro grooms, trains, conditions and
boards dogs, but they also do something
quite special to help people with arthritis.
The Center has trained several dogs as aid
dogs for the Arthritis Foundation.

“We teach themavarietyofthingsdepen-
ding on the ability of the person,” says Fran
Keyss, owner of Nanhall. “We can train
them to walk and be a crutch for the person
or support for the person. They can answer
the phone and put it back in the cradle and
open doors.”

The dogs also turn lights on and off and
are trained to pick up dropped items irn-
mediately. One of the dogs, Booker, found a
set of keys that had been lost for weeks.
Another dog, Rafﬂes, has been featured in
the National Enquirerand the Washington
Post - he was the first dog to visit the
Smithsonian Institution and the Bethesda
Naval Hospital, according to Keyss For in-
formation about aid dogs, contact Fran
Keyes at 272-6584.

VET TO GO 0

That 10-minute drive to the vet’s office is
getting longer. Last time Kitty’s claws
stayed embedded in your leg and the
upholstery has been in shreds ever since
Rover's last visit. The wait in the lobby is no
fun either — especially when two Great
Danes gang up on your Chihuahua.

There is a solution to the problem -- Hw-
thstone Veterinary Housecalls. Dr.
Margaret Hermann paysvisits to dogs, eats,
birds and other small animals in need of
treatment. She and her office on wheels are
equipped to handle anything they might
come acrossinthe way ofdiseases orinjury.
Major surgery and x-rays are left to animal
hospitals however.

in addition to avoiding the trauma of a trip to
the clinic.

says Hermann. “I can visit them at night or
on the weekend.”

visits, shots, pet supplies and a starter supp-
ly of Purina Dog or Cat Chow.

Those interested in adopting a pet should
contact Lynn Herzberger at 852-8585 about
an application. Once the application is sent
in, it will be reviewed by a small, informal
committee. After screening is complete, a
time will be set up for the applicant and so-
meone from the Humane Society or
Guilford County to pick out a pet. Before the
pet and its new friend head for home, the
owner must watch a 10-minute film provid-
ed by Purina — that rule is primarily forthe
benefit of first-time pet owners. Someone
from the Humane Society will help
transport the animal to the vet for his initial
visits. For information about the program,
call the Humane Society at 299-3060.

RES TING IN PEACE 0

Buring beloved pets is nothing new. In an-
cient Egypt, when a cat died he was mum-
mified and sent into the afterlife with a few
mummiﬁed mice for sustenance. The send-
off even included a grand funeral. 'Ibday pets
can be buried with style and dignity at any
of several local cemeteries. .

Allen Pet Cemetery, 288-9397. Burial
cost isbased on pet’s weight. Animals under
50 lbs. are $265; over 50 lbs. but under 100
lbs. $365 (because two plots are required);
burials for pets over 1001bs must bequoted.
The fee includes the plot, opening and clos-
ing the grave, burial shell and a metal
marker.

Wachovia Pet Memorial Cemetary,
724-9494, located between the North and
South Yadkin rivers in Davie County. Pick-
up and burial in the Winston-Salem area is
$50; in the Greensboro area, $65.

Farmington Pet Cemetery, west of
Winston-Salem, 998-3353. Cost of burial is
$55 for cats and small dogs; $75 for Great
Danes and Saint Bernards. The cost in-
cludes a concrete marker, perpetual care,
ﬂowers and a ﬂower at Christmas.

SPECIAL SERVICES 0

Critter Sitters, Patti Moran, 723-3326.
Personalized in-home pet care service.
While the master is away the pets can play
in familiar surroundings. Sitters will visit
your home as often requested. Moran has
two sets of rounds, 7:30-10:00 am. and
4:30-7:30 pm, with help from 32 part-time
sitters. Before departure, clients provide in-
formation about the critter’s diet, play,
medical history and the like. The service
gives medication to, cleans up after, feeds
and plays with any kind of pet — snakes and
horses included. '

“We try to give quality time to the pets,”
Moran says Prices vary. One visit for one cat
is $7; one visit for one dog is $8. Prices go up
with more than one pet. Critter Sitters also
take care of the mail, newspapers and lights.

Personalized Animal Love Ser-
vices (PALS), Gill Cook, 282-1995. “We
try to ﬁll any kind of animals needs,” says
Cook. The service will transport pets to and
from the vet or any other destination and of-
fers in-home pet care while the owners are
away. Cook exercises and cares for any kind
of pet — including snakes and horses too.

 

 

 

 

 

 

‘ ‘I try to provide good psychological care
to my pets,” Cook says. “I get to know them
as well as possible sowhen I step in the doo
I’ll know if something is wrong.” Personaliz-
ed Love Services also include getting the
mail, turning lights on and off and bringing
the paper in. Cook charges per trip based on
the number of animals, number of trips and
where the home is located, but tries to give
a break to folks who require many trips. Five
percent discounts are available for clients
gone over a week and for referrals.

A CLUB FOR THE BIRDS 0

Exotic Bird Club. President: Mary
Albright. Dues: $10, covers the cost of a
newsletter. This newly formed club meets
the second Wednesday of the month at
Lewis Recreation Center in Greensboro.
Anyone interested in birds is welcome to
join. Plans call for a program each month.
For information, call the Lewis Center at
288-4213.

LEASH LA WS 0

In Guilford County, dogs have to be on
their owner’s property or on a leash. The
same is true in Greensboro, where the law
extends to cats too.

In Winston-Salem, dogs must be on a
leash if they are not in a pen or fenced yard.
In Forsyth County, dogs must be on a leash
or behind a fence at night. Neither county or
city has a pooper scooper law in effect.

HOW TO ADOPTA STRA Yo

There are a lot of them around. Little dogs
and cats who have been turned loose to fend
for themselves. Hopefully the strays will
wind up in the backyards of people with
good hearts before they try to cross a busy
highway. But before you reach out to a lone-
ly, neglected animal, there are a few things
you should remember:

0 The animal will need shots, 3 check-up and
neutering. If you already have a cat or dog,
keep the new pet isolated until you have
him examined.

0 '12) get the animal home, approach him
slowly and talk to him reassuringly; 'Ibuch
and pet the little critter before trying to
pick him up or lead him off.

0 Once you have the dog or cat in your arms,
carry him close to your body - the heat
will comfort him. If you have to walk a
great distance, wrap him in a coat or
sweater so loud noises won’t cause him to
bolt.

0 Adopting a stray means more responsibili-
ty for mother and litter. If you don’t think
you can handle kittens or puppies or find
homes for them, it is best to have them
aborted.

0 Finally, if you come across an injured stray,
don’t just leave it. Take the animal toa vet
immediately!

PICKING A VET 0

One of the many things new pet owners
have to do is find a good veterinarian. People

who neverhave owned apet might needalit-

tle help in deciding which vet is right for

them, so here are a few tips:

0 Before your first visit make a list of puzzl-
ing things about your pet and questions
you want answered.

0 Make mental notes about the cleanliness
of the rooms, assistants and the doctor
when you arrive. Also observe the
gentleness of the doctor in handling the
pet -— he should be firm and authoritive,
but not rough in handling the pet. If he’s
impatient with your pet or you, go
elsewhere.

0 The vet should ask and make notes about
the animal’s medical history. If he doesn’t
or is inattentive at the answers, go to
another doctor.

0 If the vet cannot express technical
language in ayman’s terms, he's not the
guy for you either.

If everything checks out, ask your new vet
about his hours, holiday arrangements
and anything else you might need to know.

ATLANTA JOURNAL AND CONSTITUTION - December 7, 1987

Hotel owners are

DEAR ABBY: Several years ago
we stopped at a motel near Charles-
ton, 8.0., and before registering, my
husband asked if we could keep our
three dogs in our room with us
overnight. ‘

The motel owner said “Certain-
ly,” and handed us a card that read
something like this: “We never had
a dog that smoked in bed, got
drunk, stole our towels, nor did we
ever have to call the police to break
up a dogfight.”

The above is not exactly quoted,
but it is the general idea. I lost the
card. Will you please ask your read-

delighted

DEAR CLARITA: I published
that message several years ago. It
was sent to me by a dog lover who
had seen it framed, above the regis-
tration desk, in a small hotel. And
here it is:

“Dogs are welcome in this hotel.
We never had a dog that smoked in
bed and set fire to the blankets. We
never had a dog who stole our tow-
els, played the TV too loud or had a
noisy fight with his traveling com-
panion. We never had a dog that got
drunk and broke up the furniture.
So if your dog can vouch for you,
you’re welcome, too.”

Goats wear

in AWash. park

By Deeann Glamser
USA TODAY

SEATTLE — An animal-vs-
vegetable argument has
spawned a dilemma for Olym-
pic National Park rangers.

The problem: The pwk’s
1,000 goats, imported by hunt;
ers in the 19205, are gobbling
up fragile alpine plants.

The solution: capture or kill
, the goats.

The argument:

D “The park is recognized
for its plant communities and
rare plants —- not for mountain
. goats,” says John Gammon of
the Native Plant Society.

>To “ destroy them is not
ethical,” says Bonnie Jean
Steward of Northwest Animal
Rights Network. '

Tonight, in Aberdeen, Wash.,

. ments. Rangers favor moving
150 goats a year until 1991,

Shooting is cheapest — $100-

The mood in Sunol darkened yesterday as
_ residents began to fear that their missing may-
‘ or might have been dognaped.

. Bosco, a black Labrador retriever who was
, elected mayor eight years ago when he received

more votes than two human candidates in the min
_ corporated East Bay community, has been missing
for one week.

 

Some constituents believe the mayor may sim-
ply be out scouting a new running mate, but others
. suspect foul play. .

Mayor Bosco weighs 70 pounds and has an “alert
~»j.f and honest face,” according to Virginia McCullough,
head of the search party. . .

 

 

“He’s got a very broad forehead and he’s very,
. very friendly,” she added. His favorite food is beef
‘ jerky. . ‘ ' '

Although Sunol is not an official city, its resi- '

.. dents decided eight years ago to elect themselves a

, mayor, just for the heck of it. Tim Stillman entered
his dog on the Republican ticket, and Bosco wen.

“He promised a bone in every dish and a fire
plug on every corner,” McCullough recalled fondly;
“We’re still waiting for the fire plugs.”

The 1,000 folks in Sunbl, 45 miles east of San
Francisco, became concerned Monday when their
mayor failed to show up for a. televiSion interview. .

"You know what they remind

It is a reasonable image, she
insists. The desert, after all, was
an ocean ﬂoor at one time.

And if Meadows has her way, it
will be again. Soon.

Specifically, Meadows and her
business partner, Kent McBride,
want to turn 40 acres on the east

Purity of Greenlandvs wilderness
threatened by mining application

 

EUTE ‘
FE Rt}

5 NULIK, Greenland — The ice
that covers four-ﬁfths of Green-
land is so pure that it has been
exported to Denmark and Japan,
and New York bars have recently
iﬁnquired about buying quantities
to seryg‘ in cocktails.
i Greenlanders are proud that
e island’s wildlife can thrive in

such a: largely pollution-free en-' .

vironrnent. But now ecologists
fear that quarries and oil tankers
could 3scare wildlife away if large
quantities of oil or other minerals
are found here.

. Greenland is home to arctic

wolves , foxes and hares, caribou,
and polar bears.

Z Therl‘e are also rare white-
footed‘”geese, and pink-footed,
brent “and" barnacle geese ainong
some 100;: bird species breeding
here on‘ the world’s largest
island. I l

Theiil‘ldg‘theast Greenland Na-
tional rPark is one of the largest
in the world, but unlike other big,
national parks, its laws allow re-
searchbn'mineral resources.

There is very little work at the
moment, - but the potential is
there, said Henning Thing, in
charge of wildlife management
and conservation for the island’s
home-rule government.

The risk is highlighted in the
coastal area of Paradise Valley in
midwest Greenland, a traditional
summer gathering spot for
Eskimos, with lush vegetation,
cliffs tu-p to 700 yards high and
4,000-year-old archaeological
remains.

' “Right in the middle of this is

’ , a place where they have found

niobium metal and a . .. compa-
hy has requested permission to
explore there. There is a big con-

oveIis'y right now and it has not
been solved,” Thing said.
Opptments of the application
to mine niobium fear it could
damage the environment and
particularly that uranium, a by-
product, might emit dangerous
levels {of radioactivity, govern-
ment biﬁcials said.

Sirriilar opposition stopped the
» ining. of large deposits of

. 'um found at N arsarsuaq in
he south. '

Greenland has home rule with-
n the kingdom of Denmark,

 

from which it receives an annual
subsidy of over $300,000, so big
mineral ﬁnds could mean in-
creased ﬁnancial independence if
the home-rule government wins
its claim for full proﬁt-sharing
with the Danes.

Zinc and lead ore are Green-
land’s main mineral exports,
while oil exploration is under
way at Jameson Land in the east,

 

one of the hunting grounds on
which one in six of the 54,000-
strong population depend for
their living.

Ice has also become a seller
abroad. A spokesman for the
Greenland Trade Department
said the country was currently
exporting about 100 tons of ice 3
year to Japan, the biggest
market, in 2-pound packs.

Unlikely poets don’t blow i1

If you think the creative efforts of Our
Town’s bank auditors and tax lawyers
only entertain the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice, we think you should study the moving
poetry that Terry and Gail Stewart
wrote on behalf of their dog Punkin —
verse so splendid that it helped the teacup
poodle win the important Small Dog De-
but regional competition at the Reming-
ton Hotel.

“We worked on the poems together,”
said auditor Terry, who seemed truly
proud after Wednesday’s win that he and
his lawyer-wife could do with verse what
Shakespeare and Dylan Thomas
wouldn’t even have the guts to attempt.

Gail, however, seemed somewhat shy
about playing such a critical role in Pun-

kin moving on to the national Purina Dog
; Chow beauty competition in Atlantic City:
f “Do you have to say I’m a lawyer here in

town when you mention I helped write
I the poems?”

Yet Gail, bless her Baylor Law School-

f educated heart, didn’t seem shy at all
i when she recited a Stewart masterpiece to
; master of ceremonies Bert Parks:

I’m glad my dog is small,

Because she ’s cuddly, soft, and sweet.
And if she were to take a fall,

She ’d barely leave her feet.

i were impressed that Punkin could break-

Radical ecologists attack Northwes

By Ellen Uzelac

 

THE BALTIMORE SUN

 

, SEATTLE — Militant environ-
mentalists have become so active
in the Paciﬁc Northwest that the
timber industry has begun to
ready itself “for what some be-
lieve could be the 19805 equiva-
lent of the range wars in the last
century.

The tactics of the “eco-
terrorists” have become so severe
that in the past few weeks alone:

I A US. senator has publicly
denounced the environmental—
ists’ “terrorist” actions from the
Senate floor and has called for
severe penalties for tree spikers
—— people who drive metal spikes
into trees to harass timber
companies.

IThe regional ofﬁce of the
FBI in Butte, Mont, has been
put on notice after the apparent
sabotage of an airstrip near
Frank Church River of No
Return Wilderness in central
Idaho.

I Boise-Cascade Corp., one of
the largest lumber producers in
the country, has instituted extra
security and inspection measures
at its 32 timber and plywood
sawmills in the Northwest and
the South.

ILouisiana-Pacific Corp.
turned over to police a letter
from a Northern California con-
servation group warning that the
company’s “continued brutal de-
struction of forest life will bring
many more actions.” In the
handwritten letter, the Sonoma

County Coalition to Stop
Louisiana Paciﬁc identiﬁed an
area where its members had
driven spikes into trees.

“These are really horrible
people,” said Roberta Andersen,
a vice president of the
Sacramento—based Western Tim-
ber Association. “People are
afraid, and justiﬁably so. We rep-
resent 33 timber companies and
their 10,000 employees. There
isn’t one of us that isn’t aware of
this, and I know we’re all looking
over our shoulders.”

Militants in the environmental
movement View themselves as
part—warriors, part-saviors. And
they are becoming organized —
at least ideologically.

lumber operations

One group has proauceo a-
how-to manual called “Eco—
defense: A Field Guide to
Monkeywrenching.” The 300
page book from the founders of
Earth First! offers descriptions of
such tactics as tree spiking and
road spiking. It also details how
to “neutralize” guard dogs and
“hit” homes and ofﬁces.

Two groups appear to be at the
forefront of the radical move-
ment -—- Earth First! on land, and
the Sea Shepherd Conservation
Society on the high seas. Their
leaders talk about “ﬁeld cam-
paigns” and “missions” as if they
were going to war.

For some, it may as well be
war.

George Draffan, an Earth First!
leader in Seattle, is deadly
serious about this planet. So
serious that he’s not sure where
he would draw the line to pre—
serve it. .

“I don’t advocate anything
where people get hurt. But I
don’t see much difference be-
tween cutting down a 1,000-
year—old redwood tree and a per—
son getting killed,” Draffan, 33,

said.

“We are taking desperate mea-
sures because it’s a desperate sit»
uation. Whether we win or lose,
at least we’re trying. If people go
to jail, or if people get killed,
that’s the way it goes,” he said.
“We’re trying to look at things
from the point of view of the
non—human.

“What’s radical is the de-

struction of the ecosystem. It’s
never happened before,” Draffan
said. “Who cares about the writ-
ten law at this point? We’re talk-
ing about moral law. When your
house is burning down, you don’t
talk about rearranging the furni-
ture. You put the ﬁre out.”

The tactics of Earth First! and

“ ' _ iéﬂadmittedly go be-
MQ ‘IWL disobedience as
WW3» by groups such , as
i5:v%peace. Dave Foreman, co—
launder of Earth First!, advocates
“putting the earth ”ﬁrst in all de-
cisions, even ahead of“ human
welfare if necessary.” Earth First!
members have laid their bodies
before bulldozers, sat in trees
and pulled up survey stakes in
attempts to stop what they con- 1
sider the rape of the nation’s ;
forest land.

Sea Shepherd, based in Re—
dondo Beach, Calif, calls its
brand of activism, “aggressive
non-violence.” Its members have
sunk the ships and sabotaged the
plants of seal hunters and illegal

Whalers. The Divine Wind, a Sea
Shepherd vessel, sailed from
Seattle a few weeks ago to con—
front Japanese drift-net fisher-
men in the North Paciﬁc.

“What sets us apart is our will-
ingness to risk our own lives to
stop the killing,” said Scott Trim-

 

’ingham, president of the group.

“If presented with a choice be-

r

tween 3 material object, say a.

harpoon or a whaling ship, and
the life of a suffering animal, we
would rather see the material ob—
ject destroyed. That’s what
makes us controversial.” _
He added: “I guess we are radi—
cal, but everything is relative. M\
big fear is that 50 to 100 years
from now, people will say you
knew this was happening, yet ‘
this was all you did.”

 




CHICAGO TRIBUNE — November 10, 1987

Hi cause

Animals’ leading scientific defender

By Janet Ruth Falon

lan Beck ﬂips a switch on a
videotape machine, and a woman
begins to speak lazily from
somewhere low in her throat.

“He’s a lover. and all he wants to
do once a day for about an hour is this."
she says to the camera. “He likes to have
his skin kissed. and he blushes. But he’s
nervous. He's not himself.”

The woman lies down and stretches her
neck back. “Are you relaxing now?
Yeah,“ she coos seductively to him.
“You smell good.”

Click. This is not a scene from an X
rated ﬁlm but a clip of a woman talking
to her favorite pet macaw. Beck has seen
interactions like this dozens of times,
and he has captured them on
videotape—visual
ammunition in his battle
against skepticism.

Fortified with
academically sound
studies, Beck, 44, the
director of the Center for
the Interaction of Animals
and Society. which is
based at the Veterinary
School of the University
of Pennsylvania. wants it

loneliness and that pets are a perfectly
normal, wonderfully effective antidote to
stress. His work over the last )5 years
has convinced the public that pets are
physiologically beneﬁcial; now he has set
out to show that they are psychologically
healthful as well. '
Beck knows perfectly sane people who
celebrate their cats’ birthdays with cakes
and candles; well—adjusted adults who
know each of their turtles by name; a
stable. all-American family that took its
pet duck to Disneyland to meet Donald:
and generally upstanding individuals who
let their pets shower and snooze with
them—and even eat from their mouths.
In the United States, there are about 1.2
billion pets living in 61 percent of
American households. Beck,
probably more than any other
man alive, has seen some of this
nation’s best—treated and most—

: ments on the videocassette record-
er. With his curly salt-and-pepper
hair and beard and his animated
gestures. he looks like a jittery

The tape rolls: “We just go on

we do, right?” She kisses him.
“Wanna do something cute, some—
thing birdlike?”

“For you. it may be a personlike
bird; for her it’s a birdlike per—
son,” Beck interjects.

“What are you doing? Wanna
talk? What are you doing? Are
you a good boy? Want a toy?” she
asks in a singsong voice. “He’s like
a child. You’d put a toy in his crib
and he’d throw it on the floor out
of the crib. Are you a good boy or
a terror? Are you a terror?"

“After asking an animal a ques—
tion, there will either be a pause,
as if the animal answered. and
then they’ll continue as if they
heard the answer. or pseudo—dia—
logue, where the person supplies
the answer." Beck explains.

The bird comes close and per—
forms a favorite trick: He puts her
eyelashes in his mouth.

“A sense of trust.” Beck says.

Ever since a landmark study
conducted in the 19705 at the
University of Maryland by Katchcr
and two colleagues showed that
having a pet improved a heart pa—
tient’s chances of survival, the
physiological benefits of pet
ownerShip have become accepted
as fact. Dentists now have fish
tanks in their offices to lower the
anxiety levels of patients. and doc—
tors prescribe pets, along with ex-
ercise and better diet, for hard»
charging “Type .A” personalities.

But the value of pet ownership
as an antidote to ordinary stress
has been slow to gain widespread
acceptance, mainly because of the
misconception that people use
pets as substitutes for close rela—
tionships with other human
beings.

“There are people who play golf.
who play on computers and col-
lect music rather than deal with
human beings,” says Beck, who in-
herited his household menagerie of
two eats, a rabbit and a bird when
his teenage daughters—“two al-
most-human primates,” he calls
them—~moved in with him after
his divorce.

Beck fast-forwards the videotape,
searching for another clip. and the
machine quacks out a cartoony
jumbled speech whir. These taped
intetyiews with pet owners are a
major method of research in the
field. The pet owners are first

videotaped alone and then with
their animals. All the while, their
blood pressure is checked and
their speech patterns analyzed.

“What was somewhat of a sur-
prise is how unself-conscious peo—
ple are with animals,” Beck says.
“If you ask people to talk, there’s
a shyness, but as soon as their ani-
mal is present they relax, and they
behave with their animal—with us
present—as if we were not there.
They’re that comfortable.”

Fast forward. The slurring
sounds of other compressed con—
versations passing.

A young, sad—eyed man, an in-
mate in a maximum-security pris—
on watches as his parakeet hops
on his finger. There is a pet-
placement program at the prison.
where some inmates are allowed
to keep fish, birds or cats in their
cells.

“Can you talk to him? Can you
do that? Talk to him the way you
usually do? Not talking today?
Huh? Say something,” he says, his
voice an insistent whisper.
“Gimme kiss. Gonna gimme a
kiss? Gimme kiss.” He watches
the bird intently, following it with
his dark eyes; the bird remains si»
lent but perky. “You all right
today? You ain’t gonna say some-
thing today? Huh? Gimme kiss.
C’mere.”

The inmate’s voice is hushed
and his words personal. Listening
to him is almost embarrassing, like
eavesdropping.

The voice we use to speak with
animals is the same cooing,
stroking voice we unconsciously
turn on when we talk to babies or
sometimes lovers—higher—pitched.
slower and quieter than our
“street” voice. Beck believes that
the content of our message,
spoken in this special voice, is un-
derstood by our pets. “I think they
understand the music, not the
words,” he says.

“And I think when people say
they talk to their animal because
they have a feeling the animal un—
derstands, what they’re saying is
the animal is paying attention.
Whether they really understand or
really care—you don’t know if
your psychiatrist understands or
cares. All you know is that he or
she is nodding and is not going to
criticize you no matter what you
say—and that’s what you need.”

Animals may be especially
helpful for men. “Pets allow the
kind of physical contact that men
are deprived of in this culture,”
Beck says. “The health benefits of
animals in general may be more
important for men than women.
Not that women don’t like
animals; it’s just that they are ac-
tually less vulnerable to some of
the health problems associated
with singleness and isolation.”

“If you were sitting there in a
park. it would be risky to ap-
proach you. because it could be

threatening. it could be pushy. in- 4‘
appropriate,” Beck says. “If you }I
were there with a dog, it would be

no problem if I was jogging and

said, ‘What a cute little dog!’ and

sat down and talked about the

dog. It would not be threatening

at all. And if] had a dog, it would

make it that much easier.”

As director of the Center for the
Interaction of Animals and Soci—
ety, Beck spends most of his time
now speaking at conferences. pre-
senting papers and churning out
grant applications for research
projects that are conducted pri-
marily by graduate students. He
admits that studying the decibel
level at which people talk to their
cats and analyzing how children
learn nonverbal cues from their
dogs may seem trivial.

“1 had that image as a kid that 1
should be, you know, curing can—
cer or at least lancing boils, or
something that’s useful,” Beck
says. Adds collaborator Katcher:
“When we started this area of re-
search. colleagues would look at
you like you were studying differ~
ent shades of lipstick.”

Nevertheless, Beck says, “I’ve
thought about it a lot. and now 1
don’t think it’s contradictory any
more than, say, do we need librar-
ies? Do we need concert halls?
Whatever it is to be a human has
some value.”

Meat-eaters shouldn ’t take aim ‘at hunters

I knew as soon as I saw the hunting

pictures on your baCk page that someone
would be crying over them. It comes as no
surprise that Jim Fitzgerald is the big whiner
(“Photograph of dead deer on this page upsets
reader,” Nov. 23). I have found that the best
way to convince someone of a given proposi-
tion is with taCt and faCts, but this letter is in
response to Fitzgerald’s insulting column, not
an attempt to convert him.

Fitzgerald is a hypocrite. Now, there are
many hypocrites in Michigan when it comes
to hunting, but most people don’t have the
opportunity to trumpet their hypoCrisies in a.
major daily newspaper on a regular basis and
even get paid for it.

Fitzgerald says, in part, that he’d never
enjoyed the actual stalking of pork chops. But
he eats them, doesn’t he? Anyone who is not a
vegetarian has no business criticizing the
concept of hunting in any way, shape or form.
He should shut his mouth and eat his steak or
pork chops in the dark, thankful that someone
has made it to his grocery store so Fitzgerald
won ’t get his dainty but hungry self bloodied.
It comes as a constant irritant to me that
people are so willing to accept the benefits of
actions while they are turning up their noses
at the actions themselves.

Tell Fitzgerald if he wants to eat meat, an
animal is going to have to die. If he finds this
to be so repulsive, he can look in a corner
somewhere and find his unused strength of
character, and stop eating meat. If he Can’t do
that, he should keep his nasty comments
about those who kill the animals, be they
processors or hunters, to himself.

Non-hunters

AT THIS TIME of year, newspapers pre-
sent pictures of the vanquished and the
valiant. The vanquished are those whose
bodies are draped over the roofs and hoods of
cars. The valiant are nearby, rifles promi-
nently in hand. Proud is the adjective and
celebration is the spirit.

On the other side of the mountain, or
conversely, are the non-hunters, identified by
special “nous”; not licensed to hunt, not
carrying rifles, not stalking unwary animals,
and, most important, not killing — not
watching wounded animals die and bleed.

Too bad the sometimes profound signifi-
cance of the negative cannot be photo-
graphed.

animal that is as entitled to its own pursuit of
life, liberty and happiness as man himself?

In earlier days, it was necessary for
survival that a man kill certain beasts in order
to feed his family. I wonder when seeing one
of these beautiful creatures on that car hood,
just what that man is going to do with it. He

' cannot process it himself, but must have a

butCher do it. He can’t skin it himself, or tan it.
Will his family ever be able to stomach all
those Chops, steaks and roasts from that
cmture?

Hunters may be prompted by the primor-
dial urge of their ancestors to bring home
meat to feed their families, but now that urge
means killing these beautiful and helpless
creatures just for fun and the glory of being a
successful hunter.

HELEN A. SINCLAIR

The real sport of hunting

JIM FITZGERALD’S column saddened me
that people stereotype hunters as cold-blood-

ed killersof helpless animals who only go out
in the woods to get drunk and play cards.

True hunters do not use bait to do in a doe
10 yards away. Deer hunting is not that easy.
Deer have incredible senses of sight, smell
and hearing that alert them to the hunter’s
presence. Also, most hunters are not so cruel
as to get a thrill from “watching bloody
venisOn ... gasp for life in vain.”

The thrill of hunting is not from bagging a
deer, although accomplishing that feat in a“
sportsmanlike manner is admirable. Most of
the thrill of hunting is experiencing the?
beauty of the woods and of nature, and the"
camaraderie between men. For these reasons,
many people go back to the woods year after}
year, even though they don’t shoot anything.

' This column shows a less respectable view
of hunting, one that should not exist. And’
even though there are people out there who
hunt like that, they are not sportsmen. Ithink .
that Fitzgerald should have experienced the
other side of hunting, the respectable side,
before he ever thought about writing his
column.

Llama gets
‘ pacemaker

scientists

EAST LANSING — (AP) -- Veteri-
narians at Michigan State University
have implanted a pacemaker into a
1‘ _ . , _ -' - . . * ,. ., ' x llama, in an operation officials said

. . i . . " ‘ they believed was the first of its kind.
‘ " ' ' ' ' ‘ ' * ‘ The two-month-old animal was op-
erated on last week.

Implanting pacemakers into ani-
mals is unusual because equipment can
cost up to $5,000, said Chris Brown,
professor of large animal clinical sci-
ences at the East Lansing school.

“It has been done fairly frequently
with dogs, occasionally in horses, but
as far as we know it has never ever
been done with a llama,” Brown said.

The animal, which belongs to Jane
Wells of Ft. Wayne, Ind., originally
was brought to MSU Veterinarians
because it was suffering from a bone
disease known as lumpy jaw. Removal
, ' - _ g . of the infection was successful, but the
i;;-¥< ‘ . ' , . " . . llama’s heart stopped several days lat-

. . .. 4. er.

A temporary pacemaker was im-
planted by running a catheter through .
the jugular vein into the heart. The 1
heart stopped when the pacemaker ‘
was turned off, so veterinarians decid-
ed to insert a permanent pacemaker.

The Cordis Corp. of Miami, Fla.,
which manufactures cardiovascular
instruments, agreed to donate a pace-
maker to MSU and sent a technician to
assist during the 90-minute operation.

NATIONAL

i...

California refuge cleanup is key to Wildfowl poisoning problem

By Cheryl Sullivan
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor .
San Francisco

The polluted Kesterson National
Wildlife Refuge — which, got national at-
tention in 1983 when ducks, geese, nest-
lings, and other waterfowl mysteriously
perished - continues to be a danger to
animals as well as an enigma to scientists
trying to determine how best to clean it
up.

[hiring the past month federal agencies
working on the cleanup have msued con-
ﬂicting studies, in tone if not in hard data,
about the scope of the pollution problem
in and around Kesterson. The wildlife
refuge and surrounding wetlands, located
southeast of San Francisco in California’s
Central Valley, are important habitats for

 

birds migrating along the Paciﬁc Fiyway. .

Kesterson became contaminated by
toxic levels of selenium in agricultural
drainage water transported there to ﬁll
the refuge’s mnds, scientists say. But a
United States Fish and Wildlife Service
study issued earlier this month says the
selenium problem is probably-much more
widespread, extending into some of the
ponds in the nearby 51,000-acre Grass-
lands Water District. ' '

Agency biologists report some birds in
the Grasslands district had higher sele—
nium levels in their livers than birds
found at Kesterson in 1983 — a factor that
could be contributing to the decline in the
numbers of birds in the Paciﬁc Flyway.

by the US Bureau of

The report suggests birds may be carry— .
ing selenium back to their Canadian "8313‘;

ing grounds in the spring. These prelimi-
nary ﬁndings are based on birds collected
in 1985, when area landowners were still
ﬂooding their land with
the selenium-laced
farm drainage water.
A second report, is-
sued Nov. 24, indicates .
selenium levels in the
water at Kesterson it- '
self have dropped dra-
matically over the past
year. The data “clearly
demonstrate" that a
controversial cleanup
proposal championed

Reclamation will work,
according to scientists
at the Lawrence Berke-
ley Laboratory, who
are under contract with
,the bureau.

Under the bureau’s
experiment, some Kest-
erson ponds have been
ﬂooded with selenium-
free fresh water in an
effort to immobilize se-
lenium in the sediment. As a result, re-
searchers say, selenium levels have fallen
from 400 parts per billion to 4 or 5 p.p.b.
Selenium in the water is likely to fall to 3
p.p.b - the federal target level - during

 

 

 

the next few years, says bureau spokes-

man Jason Peltier. Critics, however, note
that selenium levels found in Kesterson

animus are still unacceptably high.

The bureau report gets to the heart of
' the most controversial
issue of all — how to

well as other sites in
the West with potential
selenium-related prob-
lems ' '

Selenium deposits
are found in the soils in
many arid parts of the
West. While the ele-
ment is considered im-
portant to human and
animal health, biolo-
gists say it can be
harmful in high doses.

Utah, Nevada, and possibly several other.

Western states.

The California Water Resources Con-
trol Board this spring rejected the Recla-
mation Bureau’s cleanup proposal in fa-

clean up Kesterson, as ,

Selenium is suspected.

vor of a more traditional - and more
expensive - disposal method. It ordered
the bureau to remove water from Kester-
son’s ponds, scrape up selenium-laden
sediments and vegetation, and deposit the
waste in an on-site landﬁll, which will be
capped to prevent leakage. '

Mr. Peltier says the bureau intends to
proceed with the cleanup as ordered by
the state board, despite the new ﬁndings
about the feasibility of its preferred
method. But if the bureau is to adhere to a
timetable to complete the project by next

‘ fall, Congress must appropriate . at least

$15 million in the next few weeks.

Experts agree the method used at
Kesterson could set a precedent for simi-
lar environmental problems expected to
arise in the future. .

Stephen Hall, executive director of the
Land Preservation Association, which
represents local water districts on the
west side of the valley, says: “There is a
need to better understand how this ele-
ment behaves in the environment, and
then to use its natural properties to aid in
alleviating the problem.” ’ ‘

“Promising” research by two scientists
from the University of California at Riv-
erside, for example, would transform
Kesterson’s selenium in the soil into a gas
that dissipates into the atmosphere, he
says. William T. Frankenberger J r., one of
the scientists, says he expects to release
preliminary ﬁndings from Kesterson ﬁeld
tests this month.




TAMPA TRIBUNE — November 22 ,

By MARILYN A. GILLEN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — Helen Gurley Brown
isn’t dead.

That perhaps explains why the
Cosmopolitan editor isn’t turning in
her grave over “Catmopolitan,” a
purr—fect little spoof of the popular
women’s magazine that hit area
bookstores this month.

From the cover shot of Pawlina
Purrzikova (dressed in a gorgeous
Norma Katmali gown and a stun-
ning Catier necklace) to the editor’s
“Pad Into My Parlor” notes to the
“Hollywood Housecats” novel ex-
cerpt, the soft-cover, magazine-
styled book translates the magazine
page by page into a language any
common cat could understand.

And one that any common cat-
lover can’t help but laugh at:

“Q. I live in an apartment and
have little opportunity to go out-
doors. I don’t really miss being out-
side but every now and then I get
an overwhelming urge to eat the
potted plants Sometimes I even
throw up what I’ve eaten, but I can’t
control it. My family is disturbed by
this

“A. Experts have explored this
activity in many cats and have sev-
eral possible explanations.

If cats could read, the book
would be a best-seller.

But, then, dogs can’t and “Do-
gue," a canine version of the fash-
ion magazine Vogue, hit the best-
seller lists when it was published in
1986.

The missing link?

More than 100 million pet dogs
and cats are owned by Americans.

‘ ‘ CATS ARE NOW the most pop-
ular house pet,” says Ilene
Hochberg, author of “Catmo-

politan” and “Dogue.” “They out-

number dogs 58 million to 49

million, and the spread is getting

bigger.”

The reason?

“I think,” Hochberg speculates
by telephone from her home in
Pennsylvania, “that it reflects the li-
festyle of the ’805. More couples are
working and so you have two-career

198.”

 

 

“Catmopolitan.”

 

Ilene Hochberg is the author of

“You don’t tell a cat
what to do, but you
can try to motivate
them Cats can be
very difficult. , 9

llene Hochberg,

households and then you have a lot
more single people, and everybody
is devoted to what they are doing
during the day.

“There just isn’t the time or the
energy to devote to taking care of a
dog. Cats are more independent,
they keep to themselves and enter-
tain themselves. You just need to
give them a little food and a litter
box. There’s no walks to take them
on, no intense grooming.

“Cats are definitely the yuppie
pet of the ’80s”

Hochberg, who by the way has
no cats and nine dogs, backed into
writing and publishing as a means
to promote her own line of canine
fashions.

“At the time I had a dog named
Morgan,” Hochberg says, “and I
used to bring him back things like
accessories and sweaters from my
trips overseas. I was dressing him
very well to take him out on his
walks on the streets of New York
City -- very fashionably — and I
got a lot of comments from people
asking me where they could buy
similar things for their dogs.

“I looked around and discovered
that I couldn’t find anything compa-
rable in the States and so I set out
to design a line of functional fash-
ions for dogs.”

To advertise her “Dogwear”
line, Hochberg wrote, designed and
distributed “Dog Wear Daily,” 8

-._._ .._..... .

newspaper spoof of Women’s Wear
Daily, the bible of the fashion indus-
try.

“And then an interesting thing
happened,” Hochberg recalls. “I
had put a coupon on the back to get
responses from people and half of
the people who said they loved the
paper also said they didn’t even like
animals. They just liked the satire
of the newspaper.

“I decided then that there was a
market for a book that would ap-
peal to both animal lovers and non-
animal lovers.”

The result was “Dogue,” a slick.
funny fashion magazine-type book
featuring dogs and dog fashions.

The public lapped it up.

But the cats weren’t purring.

“In doing the research for ‘Do-
gue,’ I had hooked in to a whole
network of information on dog prod‘
ucts, but I also found a lot of cat
information that I couldn’t use. So I
decided to do the same book for
cats.”

But while "Dogue” focused on
real-lite canine fashion, "Catmo”
takes a different tack.

“While dog clothing is integral to
a dog,” Hochberg says, “people
don’t really dress a cat. Cats don't
take very well to it. So this is not a
fashion magazine. It’s a lifestyle
magazine — a cat lifestyle maga-
zine for the Catmo Cat.”

Longhair’s Purrfect fragrance, Mai-
denfur bras and Espurrit sport

' Avoid this book at all costs if
you don’t find wordplays punny.

"All of the ads are made up,”
Hochberg says. “I should say that
right off so that there’s not any con-
fusion. And the fashion layout on
the Cat’s Pajamas was also just for
fun. But the rest of the products that
you'll see throughout the book are
real and we have the purchasing in-
formation on them.”

berg explains.

Also very real, Hochberg says, is
the health information, diet, travel
and grooming tips and psychological
insights contained in the book’s arti-
cles and columns.

“I talked to cat psychologists,
animal experts and vets to get good,
solid information and then 1 sugar-
coated it in some humorous writ-
ing,” Hochberg says. "And, yes,”
she adds before the question can be
posed, “there really are cat psychol-

Anyone who already has a cat
doesn’t doubt it: Cats are crazy.

Like a fox.

Do you come home every day to
find that your cat has scratched up
your favorite piece of furniture,
found the only clean spot on the rug
to urinate on or thrown up on the
bed again? ' .

The problem, Hochberg’s cat
psychologists say, is that the cat is
lonely and resentful at being left
alone all day. More than likely, he
is bored. Wise owners should (i)
buy the eat more toys; (2) consider
getting a second cat to keep the first
company; or (3) try spending some
quality time with the cat.

The weekend 1
a special one
for these grads

By Annette Kondo
Staff Writer

It was a special graduation
weekend for several pairs of two-
and four-legged graduates.

One of the graduating pairs was
John Ferguson, 19, of Spring Val-
ley, with Arielle, a (SS-pound,
frisky, black Labrador wearing a
yellow-and-blue backpack. They
only had been together for two
weeks, but they already had devel-
oped a close kinship.

“Give me a kiss, Arielle,” Fergu-
son asked from his wheelchair.
“Come on, Arielle.”

Arielle, .20 pounds heavier than
Ferguson, wagged her tail, then
descended upon Ferguson with
several wet kisses.

“Good girl,” Ferguson praised,
petting her in return.

“She’s very gentle,” he said.
“When I tell her to stop, she’ll stOp.
When it gets to be too much, she
knows.”

Ferguson and Arielle were one
of five pairs of disabled individuals
and their specially trained dogs
who were presented Saturday
night as members of the second
graduating class of the southwest
Canine Companions for Independ—
ence. The pairs had just passed a
two-week training course at the
center in Rancho Santa Fe.

Friends, parents, graduates and
their dogs filled the Doubletree
Hotel in Mission Valley, where,
each dog was formally presented
to the student. There also was a
class speaker, a commencement
address and the presentation of di-
plomas.

Ferguson. who has congenital
muscular dystrophy, said having
Arielle by his side helped him be
more open and confident with peo-
pie. "I guess because peOple ap-
proach her.” he said.

Arielle. however is more than
just a companion. She can pick up
dropped items. turn light switches
on and off and push elevator but-
tons.

Ferguson learned how to ask
Arielle to do those tasks during the
Canine Companion training course.
Nicknamed “boot camp” by its
participants, the course is an in-
tensive day-to-night session where
student and dog learn to work to-
gether as a team.

At the end of the course a final
exam is given. It consists of a writ-
ten final, a practical exam and a
solo expedition to a shopping mall.

“I had to buy a magazine and a
Coke," Ferguson said. “I gave
Arielle the money, she goes up to
the counter, stands on her hind
legs and gives the clerk the
money."

The clerk then gave the pur-
chase back to the dog, who in turn
gave it to Ferguson. Other tasks at
the mall included going to a res-
taurant, pushing elevator buttons
and walking through large crowds
of peOple.

 

The San Diego ‘3. *13' ..
The Canine Companic:
course has made John Fe v
guson and Arielle a team

Another graduating team was
Caryn Singer. 25, of San Diego and '
her golden retriever, Flower.

Singer’s speech impediment
from cerebral palsy made it neces—
sary to find a dog that was excep-
tionally c00perative. Flower was
specially picked and flown in from
Canine Companions’ Northern Cal-
ifornia office

“I want to go out more,” Singer
said. “I want to go to the movies. I
live near a movie theater but usu-
ally I have to go with someone.
Now I can go with Flower’

Kerrill Knaus, director of the
southwest Canine Companions off-
ice in Rancho Santa Fe, said a dog
like Flower can cost as much as
$7000 to train. The pup-pies arr;-
bred in Northern California, raised
by volunteers, then taught 89 com-
mands during six months of train—
ing.

Knaus said Canine Companions
for Independence is a 12-year-old
national organization that trains
dogs to help people with all dis-
abilities except blindness. There is
a $125 application fee, but the cost
of the dogs and their training is
supported by community contribu-
tions. The waiting list at the Ran—
cho Santa Fe office goes through
November 1988.

Graduation, Knaus. said, is a
transition for the dogs.

“It‘s the end of their training.
but its really the very beginning 01
the dog’s permanent life as a right-
hand man,” Knaus said.

For Ferguson, graduation was
also a beginning.

“I want to start a business, a
stock market newsletter specific
to stockholder interests,” he said.
“Now I have someone to help me."

Mite The Cat Flourishes
Through Misadventures

By HELEN ORDNER
If Mite could only speak, he’d

tell tales to rival any other swash-
buckling adventurer’s.

Judy Bank, the owner of the
large white cat, is convinced that
only his tenacious spirit and the
will to live have brought him
through innumerable escapades.

Mite turned up in Judy’s yard
about three years ago, bloody, close
to death, with no hair on his head.

He didn’t go away and Judy,
who is employed by A.T.& T,
couldn’t stand to see an animal
like that. She took him to a vet
and “$1,500 later, 'he was a well
kitty.”

He got his name “Mite” during
that period — “as in he mite live or
mite die, and as in ear mites.”

He had those, and most other cat
maladies. One smaller chewed-on
ear and signs of other wounds
attested to the neutered male’s
rough and tumble past.

His perilous life left him almost
toothless. The vet pulled one front
tooth and now Mite has only an
eye tooth in the front of his mouth,
and a few teeth left in the back, on
one side. He has learned to ﬂip his
food back to the working teeth that
will chew.

Stroking his fur, Judy comments
fondly, “He’s an ugly cat.”

He adjusted to life at the Bank
home, sharing attention with two
other cats, a tabby and calico, and
a registered Rhodesian Ridgeback,
Lord Wheaten.

The big warrior, who stretches
luxuriantly, is different from most
other cats, Judy found. He loves to
ride in cars, and purrs when he
takes a bath.

Eight to ten years old, he devel-
oped bladder problems and was
placed on a special salt-free diet.
His vet bill approached the size of
the national debt.

THEN, HE disappeared. Mite
was gone for a month and two
days,with Judy worrying about
him. She put out flyers, but ﬁnally
concluded that he just wasn’t in
the area. -

True to his past, Mite surfaced
again, miles from home and in sad,

3“
s ‘I
sat. shape. '

He appeared in the yard of an-
;other cat lover, Lisa Chambers,
gwh'o rescued the injured animal
and tracked down the owner by
calling DeKalb Animal Control
and reporting the tag number Mite
was wearing.

A front leg had been trapped in
Mite’s collar which was still
around his neck. He was hobbled,
dehydrated and feverish, and the

’ area under the leg had been

rubbed to a raw, deep wound.

Judy picked him up and went
straight to the vet. Another $90
this time.

Nobody knows how Mite got
from the Perimeter Mall area to
Peachtree Industrial — across
miles and miles, busy roads with
rushing traffic, and MARTA con-
struction.

Judy speculates about his living .

on squirrels. “God knows how he
was killing them with his teeth.”
She says nobody would have
stolen the “ugly cat.” '
Mlte’s recovering now, eating
more like a horse than a large cat,
said Judy, and regaining lost
weight.
. He’s getting mad at being kept
msrde, she said, and that’s a very
good sign.

Cat consideration

‘ To The Commercial Appeal:

On a recent Delta Airlines ﬂight to
Memphis, one small passenger arrived
to find no one waiting. The passenger
Was a cat and because of a family crisis,
no one had been able to come. Delta per-
sonnel, particularly Bob Gafford, made
arrangements to board the kitty at Air-
port Animal Clinic, and at the end of 10
days, contacted the Humane Society to
see if the kitty could be brought to the
society for safekeeping.

The Humane Society agreed imme-
diately, but at the eleventh hour the
family. .did arrive to claim the cat,
and one can imagine their gratitude to
Delta.

On behalf of the Memphis Humane
Society, I want to commend Delta and
Bob Gafford for taking so much time,
thought and trouble to see that one
small cat was well cared for during this

f family emergency.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - November 29, 1987

These little piggies go to market—

By Jennifer Lowe

ou survived the llama craze and passed on
lizards. You resisted buying a cute dog with a
name no one could pronounce and reined in
the urge to buy a miniature horse. ‘
You even balked at buying a Pet Rock. ,

Brace yourselves for what might be the next hot
pet, one you could go hog wild over: miniature pigs.

A pet miniature pig, weighing in at around 100
pounds, can be your friend, for life (in a pig’s case,
10 to 20 years). a ‘

It can live in your house, sit in your lap and watch
television, can walk on a leash, likes to ride in the
car and certainly will get your friends talking.

A miniature pig is smarter than a dog, cleaner
than many people you regard as pigs, and can be
trained to do its business outside.

A mini-pig is small enough that it won’t take
doors off the hinges going through doorways, and it
can be an efficient garbage disposal (although pig
chow is recommended).

“They’re a much more practical exotic pet than a
lion is,” said pet-pig breeder Kayla Mull, of

Creatures of Comfort, in,Norco, Calif.

And they cost only $1,500 each.

Mull, a native of Chatsworth, a community in the
San Fernando Valley, who has raised 20 of the pigs
in the last two years, is bringing her pigs to market
so you can bring home the bacon. A biologist, she
plans to develop a new, smaller miniature breed.

A few have been sold to pet owners around
southern California, and collectors of pig
merchandise (stuffed animals and’pig dinnerware)
have called Mull, seeking the real thing. Singer
Belinda Carlisle also has talked pigs wrth Mull.

The breed, known as pot-bellied pigs, is native to
Southeast Asia. Pot—bellied pigs look like large
footballs, brown in color with football-like skin,
though it’s softer. They are covered with short dark
hair, and some have wrinkles on their faces or
bodies. They have small beady eyes and short,
sensitive snouts. They wag their curlicue tails like
dogs, and some of them have low-to-the-ground
bellies. ’ ' ‘ ' '

But pot-bellied pigs will stand their ground, .
although they are rarely pignacious—er, pugnacious.
Surprise a baby piggy by picking it up, and it will
sqbeal in protest.

When a pig doesn’t want to wear a leash, it will
slip through it like greaSed lightning. And don’t
make too much noise when it’s a pig’s bedtime.

_ “This one,” Mull said, pointing to a‘porker named
QValker, “will get mad at me and come and close the
cor.”

That’s if you let your porcine pet sleep indoors, of
course, which they seem more than happy to do.
Whether it’s on a pillow in the laundry room or a
spot in your bed, they hunker down happily the
-night through. '

Just be sure to let them out first thing in the '
moming, Mull said, or try to train your pig to use a
litterbox. ' . .

Mull said that she has heard of a few full-sized ,
house-trained pigs, but she prefers to teach her pigs

to wait eight hours. Once outside they return to the; - ,

same established spot.

Unlike their stereotype, pigs are clean and love to -

clean eaCh other’s eyelashes, Mull said. They waiibﬁxx
in mud simply to keep c001, she insisted. {ignites

cant keep their buttsﬁom going fas(t)egrS than their

Norco. '
. The mini-pigs, like their larger relatives, are quite
intelligent. They speak in a language of about 20
sounds to convey their feelings, and they can be
taught tricks in about 15 minutes, Mull said.

Her little piggres like to ride in the car, some with
theirheads on her shoulder. They come when they
are called, put up With being walked on leashes, will
go down children’s slides, take dips in the swimming
pool and Will “sit” on command.

Gloria. and Charles Rowe, of West Covina, Calif,
have trained their 5-month-old pig, Sissy, to climb
5 rs.

“And when we sit down, she jumps up with her
front paws,” Gloria said. “We wouldn’t give her up.
She’s part of the family.” "

If you think having a pig for a pet is hogwash,
some would agree.

Debbie Townsend, of Chatsworth, a San Fernando

; Valley community, said that her two daughters,

Brandee, l4, and Kristen, 12, love their pet, Porky,

convinced.

“I think [they’re okay] in the right environment,

, but I don’t know if it works out as a house pet,” she
‘ said. -

“You can’t take them jogﬁng likeyou could a
dog,” said Ed Fonda, a pr essor of animal science
at California State Polytechnic University at
Pomona. Pigs have di iculty perspiring and would
get overheated. ‘ _

In their quest to keep cool, they also might dig up
a yard, he added.

. In Los Angeles pigs must live on land zoned for
agriculture, according to city zoning codes. An
illegal pig could bring a city Department of Animal
Regulations citation.

Like other exotic pets, pet pigs might be hard to
treat if they become sick. _ ‘

“People recognize what to do with a dog or cat,
but with pigs they’re looking at something new,”
said Jim Sullins, a livestock and range adviser for
the University of California Extension Service.

“The typical veterinarian might not be familiar '
with them.” ‘

Pigs generally arehearty animals, though
afﬂictions such as lice and ﬂeas that strike
commercial swine could also hit pet pigs. Regular
shots are recommended for pet pigs. The animal
health branch of the state Department of Food and
Agriculture keeps a list of Southern California
veterinarians that treat swine.

Signs of illness include listlessness, respiratory
distress and loss of appetite. _

“Not eating, that’s the big thng off the bat,” said ~:
Bill Lander, a swine herdsman at Pierce College.

And then there’s the idea of having a pet that
someone might/want to eat. They might not ‘be too
tasty, though, Mull said. Because they are so small,
they are used for lard or grease in some countries.
In the United States, they are used in animal
research because some of their systems are similar to
human systems.

There are about 100 pot-bellied pig pets across the
nation that have been bred by a handful of
commercial breeders, said Mull, who also raises
ponies, sheep and exotic birds. Hers came from
Sweden by way of Canada. _

Mull will sell no swine before its time; usually she
parts with them at about 8 weeks, when they can
wait eight hours before going outside. This also is a
trainable age. If you catch your pet pig in the
paratry, he won’t mind being shooed away, Mull
sat .

“Pigs have no remorse. They just don’t have time
to feel sorry about anything,” Mull said.

“They’re too busy enjoying themselves.”

FT. LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL - November 30, 1987

Aetivists' not bullish on'rodeOS

 

By GORDON WlTTENMYER
Staff Writer

They finally showed up at the
Davie Rodeo Arena on Sunday, car-
rying signs that said “Rodeo: All-
American Sadism” and “Rodeo: fun
for the pe0ple, not fun for the ani-
mals.” '

They’re members of the South
Florida Animal Activists, and they
don’t like rodeos.

“It’s entertainment like the R0-
man gladiators,” said SFAA mem-
ber Susan Hargreaves. About 10 of
the 280-member SFAA picketed
the front gate, distributing about
300 c0pies of a National Enquirer
article that claims rodeo competi-
tion is cruel to the animals.

It’s an annual picket at the Floris
da Cowboy Association state finals
in Davie. The group claims electric
prodding devices and bucking
straps are inhumanely used-on
broncs and bulls to make them
buck, and the cowboys’ treatment
of the animals in the calf r0ping
and steer wrestling events is inhu-
mane.

But Dave Morgan, who provided
the livestock, said his animals are
some of the best treated anywhere.

“I care “about my animals,” he
said. “They get more feed than any-
body, and they don’t work too
hard.”

No electric devices were evident,
but the bulls wore flank straps, de-
signed not to inﬂict pain to make
the bull buck, but to make it buck
back instead of up, said steer wres-
tler Bud Hallman.

“The flank strip is very loose,”
he said. “Animals buck naturally. It
makes them kick back [trying to

kick the strap off].”

“If you ﬂank him too tight, he’ll
sit down,” Morgan said. -

“If they [animals] don’t have the
heart to com te, they’re not going

to do it [buck ” Hallman, a 15-year

rodeo veteran, added. “There’s no
device you can use to make it com-
mte. 9’

The SFAA also claims the calf
roping and steer wrestling events
are inhumane. ,

In calf roping, the cowboy on
horseback throws a rope around
the neck of a calf running at full

speed, then staps his horse. The oth-’

er end of the rope is tied to the sad-
dle horn, and when the calf runs Out

of rope, - he’s jerked back, often ,
yanked completely off his feet. The

cowboy then ties three of the calf’s
legs together.

_ “When it went around the neck it
looked like it jerked pretty hard,”
said Nancy Donoghue, 25, a speca-

tator from Hollywood. “It didn’t

look too pleasant.”

In steer wrestling, the cowboy
jumps from his horse onto a run-
ning steer, grabs the steer by the
horns and pulls its head to throw it
to the ground.

“It seems to be a pretty fair
match between the steer and the
man,” said Brendan Donoghue, 24,
Nancy’s husband.

“I think the potential for animal

suffering is evident,” said Sgt. ‘

Sherry Schlueter, who heads the
Agriculture Crime and Animal
Abuse Unit of the Broward Sher-
iff’s Department. “Certainly the
roping events hold the greatest po-
tentiaLfor cruelty.”

Schlueter worked the rodeo for
seven years as a federally appoint—
ed animal abuse investigative

 

agent for the humane society and
for another six years as the sher-
iff’s department’s animal abuse
specialist-

The Davie Police Department,
which does not have an animal

- abuse unit, handled all policing of
" the rodeo this year. When contact-

ed Sunday night, a spokeswomen at
the department refused to com-
ment on anything related to the ro-
deo.

“They can’t hurt those things [ro-
deo animals],” Miami Beach’s Mike
Kitchen, 31, said. “I don’t think
they can.”

5% OMAHA, Neb. (AP) —— The
ﬁeld deer didn’t have a name, but
jag appeared this week and want-
éﬁd to be petted. Two men, who
rapparently took advantage of the
[animal’s nature, shot and killed
him Thanksgiving Day.

fjgan Bergman said Friday. “The
{ﬁber was like a pet.” _

Thanksgiving dinner with her
family when they heard the shot.
She and other family members ran
outside and saw two men trying to

The young buck entered the

enough to have his picture taken.

Betty Bergman, Karen’s moth-
er, said her family was eating
when she noticed someone had
turned around in their driveway.

Moments later, a shot was fired.

The Bergman family got the ve-

was registered in Blair, about 20

said. No arrests had been made

The men broke several laws, in-
cluding shooting an animal out of
hunting season and possibly
poaching, Thibault said.

In addition, the deer appeared
to have been inside city limits
when it was shot, and Thibault
said firing a weapon inside city ,
limits is a misdemeanor. ‘

Mike Jerina, who lives near the
Bergmans, said he heard what
sounded like a shot. He and other
neighbors ran out to investigate
and saw a man trying to put the
deer inside a car.

“At that point, with everyone
yelling ‘poacher,’ ” the car sped ;

 

away, Jerina said.

‘Killer’ readyto mark
Thanksgiving tradition

By Steven Mark
OF THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

 

Thanksgiving Day arrived, "but it’s
crow, not turkey, that get his dander
UP

This morning, Knagg and sOme of
his buddies plan to head to Lake La-
von to kill crows and keep up a long-
standing Thanksgiving tradition.

They’ll set up decoys, crow-calling
machines, hunker down in camouﬂage
outﬁts, and wait. And if any of those
‘black birds come, into range, chances
are they’re goners. Any that are hit are
left out in the ﬁeld for posterity and
scavengers.

It’s their own version of a turkey
shoot, a perfectly legal tradition
they’ve kept up for years because
Knagg hates crows ‘

“If there’s a crow in the road, I
swerve to try to hit him, ”' said Knagg,
Garland Independent School District
director of communications “1 haVen’ 1:
killed one that way yet, but that’s a
dream of mine

“My CB handle isnfCrow Killer.’
Sometimes people mess itnip and say
‘Crow Shooter There’s“ it}: lgiffer-

has formed a club to pro-
claim his hatred Its logo features cross

d hire is proclaimed by its ﬂame ;—.-—
Crow Population Zero. Knagg, two of
his brothers and three friends are
members;

“If anybody is havmg a problem
with crows, call us and we 11 take Care
of it, free of charge, ’? Knagg said “Our
motto is ‘Have gun, will travel.’ Which
we’ll do, aSiong as it’s .legal;”

It doesn’t take much to get Knagg
talking about crows and how much he
hates them. He despises them fer be-
ing “smart” and “arrogant,” for raiding
crops and attacking other, birds.

Knagg, a 33-yearsold journalism
graduate of the University Of Texas,
killed his ﬁrst crow at age 14. An old,
faded photograph commemorates the

event -— one of his happiest
memories, partly because heshot
it with a riﬂe rather than a shot-
gun, but mostly because he man-
aged to lure it into range.

“The crow is the smartest bird
in the world,” he said. “A hu-
man’s got to be smarter to kill
one, and most humans aren’t.

“We have a tape of crows and
owls ﬁghting — crows and owls
hate each other, they’re mortal
enemies — and that attracts
them to us. But if he sees
you, he’ll circle just out of gun
range. He’ll look at you, and
we’re looking at him, and there
isn’t a thing you can do about it.”

Knagg said the critters are
such tough opponents that he
considers the group’s Thanksgiv-
ing Day shoot a success if they
can bag three or four birds. Over
the years, however, he said the
group has killed “countless”

. CI‘OWS.

He keeps in his ofﬁce a ﬁle of
articles that make mention of
crow killing and shooting. On his
bookshelf, next to the Bible, is a
book called “Crow Shooting,”
which Knagg refers to as “the bi-
ble of crow killing.”

Published in 1946 by Bert Po-
powski, the book declares four
purposes: “First as a gesture of
self-defense; second, as a conser-
vation measure against the worst
marauder of the avian world;
third, as a rule book for the
grandest shotgunning sport in
the world; and, ﬁnally, as a

 

means of stretching the all-too-
short gunning season.”

Crow Population Zero began
when a friend saw an article
about the Yale University Early
Music Department needing crow
quills for its harpsichords. Crow
quills were used in the 17th and
18th century for the pluckers of
the keyboard instruments. A1-
most all harpsichords in modern
times use plastic, but the sound
of ﬁne quill is said to cherished
by harpsichordists.

The organization originally was
called the “Organization for the
Protection of Harpsichords
through the Extinction of
Crows.” They called it OPEC,
dropping the “H” because no-
body really cared about that any-
way.

Animal lovers may be repulsed

by the group’s activities, but

Knagg remains undaunted.
“We’re not cruel. We kill them
quickly and humanely,” he said.
“The Audubon Society ought to
thank me for what I do. As 1 un—
derstand it, they’re concerned
mostly about songbirds, and
crows kill those kind of birds.”

Leon Ladyman, Dallas County
Audubon Society president, said
crows are not as bad as other
predators when it comes to
threatening songbirds.

“Each one serves its purpose in
keeping the place cleaned up,”
he said. “The crow serves its pur—
poses not only in that it eats nuts
and the like, but it is somewhat
of a scavenger. I don’t think this
area is overrun with them. I
like crows. They’re not the ones I
like the best, but every one’s got
its place.”

Carol Cobb, Dallas Society for

the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals director, said of the group,
“I think it’s a little sick. I guess
the question is, have you investi-
gated what the laws and statues
are regarding this? If they are ad—
hering to the law, there’s not a
lot we can do about it.”

Louis Washington, a Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department
game warden, said hunting crows
is legal year-round. “They should
not have any problem with
crows,” he said. “They have to
have hunting licenses, of course,
and generally it’s not legal to
shoot within city limits.”

Knagg said he only shoots 19- .
gally, although some of his favor-
ite hunting grounds have disap—
peared as civilization reaches
across the prairie. He intends to
keep shooting crows until he
dies, and plans to bequeath his
12-gauge, doubleobarrel shotgun
to his son to continue the tradi—
tion. The boy has asked to join
Crow Population Zero members
for the Thanksgiving Day shoot.

“This is something I’ve grown
up with, something I’ve done all
my life and something I will con—
tinue to do,” Knagg said.

He looks out his window,
where a huge crow has perched
on a telephone pole. It’s been do-
ing that for the past few weeks,
and Knagg sometimes calls other
members of the club about it.
They get really mad when they
hear about its gall.

Knagg said he fantasizes about
setting a small explosive device
on the pole, with a remote con-
trol, that could be set off when
the crow roosts there.

“I’m always hunting crows,
even in my mind.”

Aransas providing the whoopers with

said, and well-meaning workers nearly de-

said. “We should start to see a geo-
metric increase in the population.
We’ve waited 50 years for this.”

speeds of up to 70 mph — until
they find another thermal to rise in,
Schwindt said. This way they can
cover the 2,500 miles back to
Wood Buffalo National Park in two
weeks, he said.

The cranes take from four to six
weeks coming down to Texas,
however, because a chick less than
six months old is accompanying
each adult pair.

But as the flocks of whoopers
grow, their Texas refuge shrinks
and is in constant danger.

“We’re losing land all along the
refuge all the time,” said Brent
Giezentanner, manager of Aransas.
“We lose about three acres a year
to wave erosion. Every time a boat

passes on the lntracoastal Water-'

way, we lose a bit of land.”

Those boats and barges present
another problem. If any of the toxic
chemicals routinely being shipped
on the lntracoastal were to spill
near Aransas, the delicate habitat
of the whoopers would be de~
stroyed, he said.

“And the birds are constantly
being excluded from more portions
of the refuge itself,” Giezentanner
explained. “Human activities like
hunting and fishing and air boats
are an obnoxious disturbance to
these birds. They can be chased
hundreds of yards away.”

What is remarkable, he said, is
how the whooping cranes which
seldom see a human face the six
months they spend in Canada ac-
cept the commercial sightseeing
boats operating out of Rockport.

“They’ll run from other boats,
but the commercial boats they
don’t pay much attention to. May—
be it’s because the boats are so big
the birds realize they are not preda-
tors.”

A number of boats, like Capt.
Hany Sloat’s “Lucky Day,” ferry
tourists and bird fanciers to within
100 feet of the cranes.

“The boats are bringing millions
of dollars to this area and they’re
not taking anything out. They’re
providing a great service and ev-
erybody leaves happy,” Giezentan-
ner said.

US. Fish and Wildlife officials at
Aransas don’t interfere with the
whoopers, he said. The rare birds
are counted, their environment
protected. Otherwise, they are left
alone.

Other government help in pre-
serving whooping cranes has been
much more direct. And less suc-
cessful.

In 1975, the US. Fish and Wild-
life Service and the Canadian Wild-
life Service started a program using
sandhill cranes in Idaho as “foster
parents” for whooper eggs.

The sandhills nest in the Grays
Lake National Wildife Refuge and
winter at the Bosque del Apache
refuge along the Rio Grande in
New Mexico.

So far that experiment has met
with less than the success scientists
hoped for, said Giezentanner.

In the meantime, Aransas re-
mains the last refuge of the only
whooping cranes in the world.

 




LOS ANGELES TIMES - November 20, 1987

iilnspired by John Henry, Former Schoolteacher Creating a Life for Geldings After Racing Years
:y 311$ §I$I§TINE .

- :EMECULA, Calif—When
3 ’John Henry was retired in

i1985, there were people lined

at owner Sam Rubin's door with
fers'of a home for the old gelding.

,. Joe Taub, Rubin's friend, said the
tam-time Horse of the Year would
k welcome at his . farm in New

-rsey. Hollywood Park and Santa

,5 nita both inquired about making a
in? ace for John Henry.

John Henry finally was sent to
e Kentucky Horse Park in Lex-
jugton, Ky., a financially strapped
i. drist facility that needed drawing
' trac‘tions. After an ill-advised
g} tempt to revive his racing career
ded‘ in August 1986, John Henry,
aw 12, is back in Kentucky with

orego, a three-time Horse of the ‘

ear, and a few other notable
.-ises.. ,
But'for every John Henry; there
e hundreds of horses like Perry
qabin, a 10-year-old gelding who
-_ as better bred than John Henry
' d ran in more races.
. Perry Cabin, a son of Arts and
ﬁletters, the 1969 Horse of the Year,
ﬁn 111 times, won 18 races and
' rned almost $350,000. For most of
is career, Perry Cabin was what
hn Henry resembled as a young
oroughbred—a horse who could
‘ n in the claiming ranks and earn
his owner an occasional paycheck.
§ John Henry went on to win
million-dollar races. The pinnacle
cg Perry Cabin’s career was a

RETIREMENT FARM

$21,000 victory at the Los Angeles .

County Fair [one summer. Last
year, Perry Cabin’s ankles would
take no more of the pounding and
he had developed arthritis as well.

Now Perry Cabin liVes with nine “

other geldings on a six-acre farm
owned by Dick and Jane Harris in
Temecula,

Three of the horses have only
one eye each. Another is a 14-
year-old pony . named Cody, who
has Spent most of his life on the
track, escorting horses to the post,
but who now serves as sort of an

equine sergeant-at-arms. Cody 7
"makes sure that Goldy's, Com-Y
mander doesn’t make a daily snaCk

out of One Eyed Romeo, a pussycat
who needs help defending himself.

If Grace Belcuore has her way,
this motley menagerie will grow. '

Belcuore, a retired Los Angeles
schoolteacher, drives the round-
trip 220 miles to Temecula once a
week, showing up at the Harris
farm with two plastic bags of the
biggest carrots you ever saw. Not
big enough to choke a" horse,
though, because they don’t last
long. Even with only half of their
vision, One Eyed Romeo, Perry
Cabin and Rough Rider can see her
coming. So can the others.

Earlier this year, Belcuore
founded the California Equine Re—
tirement Feundation (CERF), a
nonprofit group whose only pur-
pose is to prevent. old, retired
geldings from reaching inhumane
ends.

Without corporate help, Bel-

I

cuore has come far in just a few
months. The Harrises have donated
half of their land as a home for the
horses, althOugh this location could
be short term, since the farm is for
sale.

A 20-acre ranch being built by
Jim and Kathy Hoffman in
Moorpark, Calif, will also be used

, for the geldings, and Don Mead, a

developer who is building a 2,000-
acre training center in the Santa
Ynez Valley, has allocated 100
acres to CERF.

Right now, CERF could be ‘con-
sidered land-rich and coffer-poor.
Belcuore has never owned a horse,
having come to racing about 15
years ago as a racegoer, so there
are no automatic answers to her
knocks on the door. She has, how-
ever, rounded up several dozen
volunteers, and Mary English, who
works for Western Saddlery, is
CERF’s liaison with horsemen on

' the backstretches at Santa Anita

and Hollywood Park. .
Belcuore got the idea for CERF
when John Henry was pulled out of
retirement. She talked with Greg
Ferraro, a veterinarian; then Ron
McAnally, John Henry’s trainer,
allowed Belcuore to spend about six
months at his barn, to learnthe

inner workings of the horse busi- '

ness.
“The questions I had were about
what happens to these geldings

'when they can't run anymore,”

Belcuore said. “They don’t deserve
to be forgotten. Locally, many of
these horses had the popularity of a

John Henry. There’s a real need
hereto take care of them after their
racing days are over.”

Belcuore got started with a
6,000-name mailing list that was
supplied by the California Thor-
oughbred Breeders Assn. The
Harrises read about CERF in
Southern California Land, a maga-
zine, and the first horse accepted
was Pecos Pippin, who was owned
by Greer Garson and‘iher- husband,
Buddy Fogelson. Pecos Pippin, who
has the same parents as the
stakes-winning Truce Maker, nev-

, er made it to the races because of

injury and he was gelded before
CERF took him.‘_ ,

Others that have folloWed Pecos
Pippin here include Menswear,
who won the Native Diver Handi-
cap at Hollywood Park; Rough
Rider, who won 7 of 8 races in 1982;
and Coyotero, who began winning
minor stakes races when he was a
7-year-old and won the Albany
Handicap at Golden Gate Fields.
The entire group earned an esti—
mated $2 million on the track. .

The other day here, Belcuore and
Jane Harris talked about insurance
rates, which are doubling. It costs
more than $1,000 a year just to
minimally feed aghorse. And al-
though some‘ veterinarians have
donated their services, there are ‘
eventually bound to be bills, be-
cause these are old horses, proba- ,
bly older than their years.

Rough Rider, who lost his eye ,
when he was accidentally struck
by a whip, was in training until he

 




1 tore the skin on his leg from the
knee to the ankle. Menswear has
bad legs, a plate in his knee and has
suffered from pneumonia.

Belcuore'estimates that the San-
ta Ynez tract has the potential to
accommodate 80 horses. Develop—
ing the property will cost $270,000
and such a population would easily
drive CERF’s needs to more than
$100,000 a year. - g

The money now in CERF’s till
has been arriving in trickles. Lisa
Blackburn, a 14-year-old girl who
especially likes One Eyed Romeo,

has been saving her baby-sitting
money and sending in a few dollars.
‘ ,Belcuore is developing an honor-
ary “adoption” system, with donors
receiving a certificate and a racing
picture of the horse if they specify
him by name. .
_ Another horse that Belcuore is
‘ trying to add to her band in
Temecula is Item Two. The 9-
year-old gelding won 23 races but
his 78th start was his last when he
broke down at Fairplex Park last
month. In Bradbury, veterinarian
Skip Parks is trying to nurse Item
Two back to health, but the horse’s
condition has been guarded.

On the track, Item Two really
made the rounds. He was claimed
“ three times just this year, the price
dropping from $20,000 to $3000.
The day he was injured, he was
running for $6,250. Time made him
a cheap horse, but one that’s earned
a happy retirement if he lives to get
the chance. -

EEMPHIS, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1987 .

CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) — The
Rocky Mountain gray wolf has
been absent from Yellowstone
National Park for decades, and
Wyoming’s congressional dele-
gation, fearing for nearby cattle
and sheep, is in no hurry to see
the predator return.

A plan drafted by the US. Fish

; and Wildlife Service calls for 10
breeding pairs of wolves to be

, moved to Yellowstone in an at-

: tempt to re-establish a prey-pred-
ator balance in the park and to
return the “missing link” to Yel-
énwstone‘s ecosystem.

But Sens. Malcolm Wallop and

éar: Simpson and Rep. Dick

gv don’t believe the wolves
m... :atay within Yellowstone
and have successfully side-
tracked the plan.

Turn-of-the-century state and
federal eradication programs
wiped out the wolf in the north-
ern Rockies. Bounty hunters
killed 81,000 from 1883 to 1918.

 

Today wolves are naturally re-

establishing themselves in Gla-
cier National Park in northern
Montana, but doubts that they
would migrate south to Yellow-
stone prompted a Fish and Wild-
life Service team to recommend
artificial reintroduction.

Yellowstone’s potential wolf
range is the park’s 2.2 million
acres and an additional 4 million
acres in surrounding forests and
wilderness areas.

The projected wolf population
would be 80 to 120 animals. The
area’s 50 livestock operations in-
clude 10,000 cows and 5,000
sheep.

Proponents of reintroduction
cite low livestock kill rates in
Minnesota, where the 20 million-
acre wolf range contains rough-
ly 1,200 wolves and about 234,000
head of cattle and 91,000 sheep.

Minnesota’s annual livestock:
loss amounts to about five head

of cattle per 10,000 and about 12

 

THE COMMERCIAL APPEAL

Buffalo roam; wolves refused ‘‘‘‘‘

sheep per 10,000. according to
David Mech, a wildlife biologist
who has studied Minnesota’s
wolves since 1969.

But Jack Turnell, a Meeteetse,
Wyo, rancher who visited Min-
nesota wolf territory last spring
and at first felt that wolves and
Yellowstone-area ranchers
could co-exist, has since
changed his opinion.

“When I got home, I thought
maybe if they just kept them in
Yellowstone and everything else
that got out was killed, ,I could
probably live with that,” he said. .
“(Now), I’d just rather not see

 

Wyoming range

, home on

them in Wyoming at all.”
Turnell worries that wolves
could not be confined to Yellow-
’stone and will attack livestock
and prey on big game. . .
The park’s neighbors, ironi-
: cally, have spent the last two
winters worrying about another
sort of invading Yellowstone
’ beast, the bison. Ranchers
feared that bison that wander
out of the park could infect their
cattle With brucellosis, a conta—
gious disease that causes cows to
abort their calves. .
The Montana Legislature in

, 1985 approved annual buffalo»

hunts. Over two seasons,
hunters have killed scores of. hi-
son outside the park boundaries.

Last summer, National Park
Service director William Penn
MOtt was ready to take the next
step in the wolf reintroduction
process, assembling an env1ron-
mental impact statement, but
Wyoming’s congressmnal dele-
gation objected and. Mott relent-
ed. Today the reintroductlon
plan is on indefinite hold.

Not surprisingly, the debate
has produced two sets of ‘ facts
and supporting evidence. .

A survey by a Universuy of

~ Wyoming graduate student con-

cluded that those who oppose
the reintroduction believe tales
that portray wolves as man-eat-
ers. A 1985 survey of Yellow-
stone visitors showed 6—to-1 sup-
port for wolves. . .

But Cheney said OlltSldeI‘S
should not decide issues affect-
ing Wyoming.

“The wolf is not an endan--
gered species,” Wallop added.
“There is an abundance of
wolves. It’s not as though put-
ting them in Yellowstone Na-
tional Park is going to make cer-
tain their survival.”

It’s Not Elitist far Hunters to Pay a Fee

used to be. On public

or limited in variety.
Deer may be plenti-

 

ful, but elk, pheasant.

and bear are hard to find. Hunters
complain about too many hunters; in
fact, some have given up hunting alto-
gether for'fear of losing their lives in
hunting accidents. Meanwhile, more
and more property owners are past-
ing their land.

There is a way for hunters to enjoy
themselves, remain safe from other
hunters and find more appealing
varieties of game. It's called fee hunt-
ing: paying for the right to hunt, usu-
ally on private land, but sometimes
on state or Forest Service property.

The words “fee hunting” are a red
flag to a lot of people. Many hunters
take it almost as a national birthright
that they can roam at will on private
and public land without paying for the

privilege. These hunters recognize
that property owners have a right to
keep people off their property and
thus have the right to charge for ac-
cess. Perhaps for that reason, they
and their advocates couch their ob-
jections in broader terms.

They argue that since wildlife is
owned by the state, landowners who
charge hunters for access to game
are profiting from state-owned wild
life. Moreover, the argument goes, if
fde hunting becomes widespread, the
average person Will no longer be able
to afford to hunt.

“We are turning hunting more and

'more into a rich man' 3 sport, ” com-

plains John Phillips, a legislator in
Montana, where fee hunting has
taken off in the lent few years.

Indeed, fee hunting is often associ- '

ated with wealth since, in the past,

' only the highest-quality hunting com-

manded a price. In the minds of
many, fee hunting means hunting
ducks in private lodges in the Caroli-
nas, Where hunters wouldn’t dare en-
ter a duck blind without the right gear
from Qrvis or Abercrombi'e & Fitch.
Or it means exclusive “shooting pre-
serves,” where pheasant or quail are
released from pens for the hunters’
private enjoyment.

While this elitist image does not
prevail everywhere, it sets the tone.
Even in Texas, where about half of all
hunters hunt on leased land, fee hunt-

ing is still often associated with hunt-

.ing exotic imported species on pri-

vate game preserves.

But as the number of hunters in the
country has grown to nearly 17 mil-
lion (about 19 percent of all men over
the age of 16 hunt) fee hunting is
emerging as a fact of life. And it isn’t
just for the elite.

It is true that you can pay $5,000 a
week, for a first~class elk hunt in Utah,
complete with guide and packing
services. But you can also pay $10 a
day to hunt deer- or' upland birds in

Montana. 'Most hunting fees are

somewhere in between. In South
Carolina, sportsmen can hunt wild
bobwhites for $175 a person, while a
spring turkey hunt without a guide in
central Texas costs $125 for three

days. A Montana company charges
hunters an annual membership fee of
$300 plus an additional charge for
each animal killed —- $100 for a bull
elk, $25 for a buck deer;

These fees are not prohibitive for

' hunters who, according to the Fish

and Wildlife Service, spend an aver-
age of $500 a year on licenses, travel,
food, lodging and equipment. In re-
turn for their payment, hunters have
a far better chance of killing game. in
New Mexico as a whole, for example,
a hunter’ 3 chance of killing a black
bear is 3 percent. However, at the pri-
vate Vermejo Park Ranch in New
Mexico, the hunter has an 80 percent
chance.

One could just as easily argue that
it is elitist to require people to pay for
food in restaurants. lf food were sold,
this logic would. run, only the rich
would have anything decent to eat -—
the average people would just eat
scraps. Of course, this is absurd. We
manage to have not just Four Sea-
sons and Lutece in New York City,
but McDonald’s and Brew ’n Burger.

In fact, the way to make a fortune
in the reataurant business is to find a
formula unit appeals to the masses,
not to the few. In the same way, we
can expect fee hunting to cater to the
entire spectrum of hunters, not just
the wealthy.

Critics tend to ignore another fair-
ness question. If wildlife is owned by

ééourting Condor Couple ‘
Raise Hopes for a Chick .

By JANNY SCOTT, Times Staff Writer

SAN DIEGO—A pair of Califor-
nialcondors at the San Diego Wild
Animal Park have commenced
what curators say is an elaborate
and prolonged courtship, raising
hopes that the couple may produce
next ’spring the first condor chick
conceived and hatched in captivity.
(- The pair is one of only three pairs
believed currently capable of
breeding among the 27 California
condors'known to be living. All 27

have been captured and are being

“Hopefully, this is a prelude to
breeding the condors in captivity in
thespring,” Bill Toone,the park’s
curator of birds, said Tuesday.
. To have birds again in the
wild is going to depend very much
on the reproductive capabilities of
;the;birds in the zoo.” .

The two condors—a 7~year-old"

Imalé designated Adult Condor 4 or
A054, and an adult female of
unknown age designated UN-1 or
fUn‘known i—‘began sporadic

=f‘courtship behaviors" .about a "

month ago and {now appear to be
WWW some ”five tines a day,

Toone said

, Duringcomtship, the male lands

approaches the female with a rock-

ing motion and circles her in the

Toone said the female may then

iii “neck” with the male, rubbing her-

neck [and head against his. After
several minutes, the process usual--
1y ends abruptly with the female
snapping at the male—an outcome
that should become less common
over the next few months.

The birds have also begun “in-
vestigating the nest area togeth-
er”-—a behavior common in th(
wild as breeding season approach-
es. Toone said keepers have ob-
served “more and more traffic it
and out of the nest box and roost
area" in the condors’ enclosure at
the park.

“He’ll have to keep warming her
up for several months," Toone said.

The next step would be mounting
and copulation. After that, UN -1
might be expected to lay a single

. egg within several weeks.

' Breeding program officials have
not decided whether to “manipu-
late” the birds’ breeding—that is,
remove a first egg in order to
encourage more. That decision will
be made in conjunction with state
and federal officials involved in
protecting endangered species.

Single Season

Toone said past experience in the
wild indicates that it might be
possible to get as many as three
eggs in a single season through
manipulation. .

“This is real encouraging, and I
have every hope that it’s going to
pan out with eggs and chicks in the
coming year,” Toone said.

1 Toone said he believes that the
successful breeding of AC-4 and
UN-l would shatter what he called
a myth that condors cannot be bred

' in captivity. He said it has not been
done so far because there have
been so few mature condor pairs.

‘ The final Challenge, Toone said,
will be to prove that condors born

, and raised in captivity can be

A. reintroduced and survive in the

" wild. If breeding succeeds - this

spring, that reintroduction could
begin as early as 1990 to 1993,
‘ Toone said.

.Burying pet sorrowful reminder of shortness of life

I once met a man who, in a con-
versation about the pros, cons and
possibilities of reincarnation, said he
wanted to come back as a dog and
spend his days chasing squirrels.

I thought of him as the two

women in my remote “neighbor- .

hood” and I dug a grave in the
damp, red clay near the old weath-
ered barn to bury Fred, my dog.

Fred had chased not a squirrel
but probably a pickup truck. I won-

that he had lost the race.

the love we gave her, she had
chronic health problems no amount
of concern or money could cure,
and finally they were too much.

[But we had been joined by oth-
ers. ll‘here was Apalachee Cat, the
first jvisitor to welcome us when we
came to the country. Apalachee Cat
had bowed back legs, talked contin-
ualiy and would take walks with
George, whom he would. tackle in
frustration when he thought they
both had enough exercise and need-
ed to sleep in the sun for a while.

One day, he brought to live with
us his mate, a calico, and their nine
balms. I know he was the father,

because four of them looked like‘

miniature clones, replete with
bowed legs. I tried to give the
mother a fancy name, but George
persisted in calling her Mama Cat,
and that she was, until a do killed
her. It was a good name. e al-

after her children were adopted. She

would bathe the very skin off of you .

if you would let her.

In the country, stray dogs come
and go, and being a cat, person (and
grieving over Mama Cat), I wanted
nothing to do with them. But when
George began calling a servile
brown creature with an underbite
and a head too big for his body,
“Fred,” I knew we were saddled
with him.

Fred got himself a girlfriend, a
big, loose-jointed creature totally
unsuited to him, I thought. She hung
around him shamelessly, and I kept

'waving her off, hissing, “Go away,

go away!” It never worked. She
would only come closer. That was
before I realized she had been
adopted by my neighbor, who has a
sense of humor and actual] named
her Go Away. (My neigh or also
took in a pregnant stray she calls
Florence, in honor of Florence Crit-
tenton, maven of homes for unwed
mothers.)

Fred and Go Away (who spent
her time collecting beer cans from
the roadside when she wasn’t kiss-
ing Fred or chewing on his ear)
were inseparable. Together they
would soar in joyous leaps over the
tall grasses of our fields. I have
never seen a greater love story, not
Romeo and Juliet, not Antony and
Cleopatra. Finally, my neighbor and
I realized they were our “mutual”
dogs, because when you had one
around, you had both.

 

Then another creature joined us.
Geor e found her in the field, a cal-
ico ke Mama Cat, with the same
markings, the same hi h little voice.
I named her Tortiga. palachee Cat
at last was happy again.

When George died, I grew closer
to Fred and Go Away. They accom-
panied me on m lonely walks. By
then I was griev g, too, for Isabel-
la, my tiny threelegged, 15- ear-old
cat. I was not over that w en one
day Dr. Neal Dickerson, who com-
passionately had let me sob my
heart out in his presence not long
before, called me to say Obsidian
had died. Obsidian had been antique
and senile, so although I buried him
with sorrow ,and tears, I thought
surely this had to be my last
funeral.

Recently, at the same time, Ap-
alachee Cat and Go Away disap-
peared. It is the hunting season in
the country. Fred and Tortiga were
devastated. The-three of us wan-
dered around like ,lost souls in our
grief. Then Fred was killed.

My neighbor said, when she

SAN DIEGO TRIBUNE - November 19, 1987

Group of black bears _
finding room in sprawl
of Los Angeles suburbs

1? Los ANGELES (AP) - It may come as a surprise to most city folks here,
3but in the mountains overlooking the Los Angeles basin lives a thriving
gcommunity of about 100 black bears.

The bears roaming the oak-covered canyons and peaks of the rugged San
Gabriel Mountains are descendants of 11 “troublemaker” bears deported
,from Yosemite National Park in 1933. -

But since then their 150-5quare-mile range has steadily been surrounded by
:Southern California’ 3 suburban sprawl, and as civilization encroaches, scien-
§tiSts are wondering whether the shy animals will continue to do well.

" “When it comes to bears, we understand so little about their ranges and
',habitat that we don’t know what to protect and what to leave alone,” said
:Gerald Braden, who 1s helping conduct a $9, 000 study of the bears funded by
the Los Angeles County Fish and Game Commission.

Braden, a graduate biology student at California State University, San
gBernardino, and Glenn Stewart, a professor at California State Polytechnic
University, Pomona, have been tagging bears with homing devices for
months.

. Eight bears have been tagged, but two were killed by licensed hunters who
claimed they didn’t notice the bears were wearing radio collars and ear tags.

The radio collars allow the researchers to track the bears and learn what
they eat and what they may need to survive.

Braden has spent much of the last year wandering the ravines and ridges of
the San Gabriels, following in the footsteps of the bears. In the process, he’s
become fond of his reclusive subjects.

“Scientists aren’t supposed to get attached, but I’ve named the ones I’m
tracking because they have distinct personalities, like dogs, but really more
so,” Braden said recently. “You can tell without checking their collars who
the are.”

'llrash Man is one of Braden’ s favorites. The bear, easily recognizable
because he walks with a bouncy step, was named for his tendency for gluttony
at campground trash bins.

“He has a certain style in a dumpster,” Braden said. “He’ll stand in the
garbage, cross his front arms lazily over the edge of the dumpster, and gaze
around like he’s really happy.”

Then there was Kool F001, a 7-year-old bear cornered by hunting dogs and
shot to death shot four weeks 35° as it clung to a tree,

Braden was tracking Kool 001 in Upper Big Tujunga Canyon when he
heard the yelping dogs and the blast of gunfire.

“It was a horrible thing to experience, and I just really let go when I found
the hunters,” Braden said. “They were very apologetic, but Kool Fool was
dead.”

Attacks on humans are occasionally reported throughout the United States

but Braden says he’s confident the bears won’t attack him. .
“It’s like a mutual admiration club,” he said. “I know they’ re not going to
hurt me and apparently, from the way they behave toward me, they’ve ,

decided I’m not going to hurt them.” -

Judge Cancels

Cougar Hunt,
Says Impact
Is Uncertain

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer

SAN FRANCISCO—A Superior Court judge here on
Monday canceled what was to be the first mountain
lion hunting season in 16 years, ruling that state Fish
and Game officials had failed to fully consider the
consequences of the proposed kill.

In a ruling lauded by environmentalists, Judge Lucy
McCabe said the Fish and Game Commission did not

address a wide range of issues, from the impact of '
recent forest fires in California on the mountain lion
f population to how the predators’ deaths would affect
their prey, deer and wild horses.

“It’s not there,” McCabe said of the commission’s
attempt to analyze the effects of the proposed hunt.
The ruling, resulting from a lawsuit filed by

environmental groups, ended the commission’s hope to

salvage the final six weeks of a proposed 79-day season
ending Dec. 31 and threatens plans for a season next
year.

“I don’ t see how they can have a season this year,”
said Deputy Atty. Gen. Denis D. Smaage, who
represented the commission.

Smaage intends to urge the commissipn to appeal the
decision, in the hope that a higher court ruling would
solidify rules under which hunting seasons would be
conducted. But he said a state appellate court probably
would not agree to hear the case until next year—and
might not decide it until well into a 1988 season.

Impact Report Ordered

In a tentative ruling last month, McCabe ordered the '

commission to perform a cumulative environmental
impact report. The commission responded by holding a
new hearing to address broader issues.

But McCabe said Monday that the state fell short

, once more by issuing new findings that were an

“absolute pro forma rechurning” of the previous effort.
McCabe said the commission apparently did not

, address an issue raised in an April letter by the

National Park Service warning of adverse effects on

' cougars that live 1n national parks such as Sequoia and
j Lassen but range into unprotected areas where
‘ hunting would be allowed

Gov. George Deukmejian opened the way for

? mountain lion hunting last year by vetoing legislation
i, that would have extended a ban on the sport that dated
' back to 1972.

The renewed hunt drew backing from sportsmen
who said that deer herds were being depleted and

\

ranchers who said livestock were being killed. Cougar \

attacks on two children in Orange County fueled the \
support, though no hunting was to have been allowed
there. V

May Starve Within T we Weeks

 

30-Ton Gray Whale Entangled 111 Fishing Net

By PAM LITTLE, Times Staff Writer

A 30-ton California gray whale,
entangled in a fishing net off San
Diego, swam Friday into Mexican
waters, where it will probably live
for several weeks before eventual-
ly starving to death, marine wild-
life auth’drities said

Divers from Sf“,

was wrapped tWo or three times .
around the animal, said Sea World ~
spokeswoman Jackie Hill The net '

is normally used to catch swordfish
and sharks.

Hill said that although the}
whale’ s flukes are free, enabling it:

to sWim and dive, it is prevented
from feeding because its head is

caught‘in the net. The species is a

baleen whale, which feeds by si-
phoning food through filters in its
mouth. '

“It [the whale caUght in the net]
can‘t siphon anything through,"
Hill said Friday. “I ve likened it to

Hill said diVe‘rS'managed to get

which would dive for up to seven

said, but whether the species is

population itself is at a historical
high level. ”

Net Drop Illegal Soon ‘ ‘

Dropping drifting gill nets Will
become illegal within 75 miles of
coastline as of Dec. 15, when whale
migration typically begins, said
Lecky of Southwest Fisheries.

This is the first gray Whale in
three years to get caught in a

. drifting gill net. The animals usual- '

ly get caught in anchored gill nets,

used to catch halibut, Lecky said.
“It’s early in the year for this

kind of thing to happen,” he said.

' Drift gill nets are usually a mile

 

i
i

_ long and are made of tightly braid—

ed nylon, "one-eighth t0 One-quar-
tar-0f an" inch thick. Stock said. He
said drift nets used to be legal only

at night, but are now allowed in
- , daytime as well
The California gray whale is on .

“It’ s legal to place drift gill nets

. there, ” Stock Said. “For this Whale,

there just happened to be bad luck

. involved. ” ,
Lecky said that migrating Cali- .

for-nia grays usually get caught in
set gill nets, which are used to
catch halibut along shorelines. He
said there are show. 10 reports a
year of whales getting caught in
- the set 3111 nets.

In September, he said a new law
clused areas to set gill nets in point
areas alongthe coast where whales
tend to congregate, such as Point
Loma and Dana Point. The law also
required a break away panel in the
net to allow whales to escape.

The California gray whale mi-

grates from Alaska to Mexico a‘dd~ '

back from December through May.

Mrs. Constance F. Yarbrough

Atlanta, Georgia 30345

Dear Mrs. Yarbrough:

Thank you for letting me know of your concern about the
management of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.

I certainly share your interest in ensuring that our unique
natural habitats are properly protected. Our wilderness areas
are among America's greatest treasures, and we must preserve
these lands and the wildlife that inhabit them for future
generations.

Recognizing the problem of timber harvesting in the Tongass
National Forest, Senator Proxmire has introduced a bill, S. 708,
that eliminates the fixed logging target and subjects the subsidy
to annual review as part of the appropriations process. This
bill has been referred to the Subcommittee on Public Lands of the
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which I am a
member. Congressman Mrazek has introduced a similar measure in
the House.

Hearings on this proposal have been held in the House, and
in early November I will chair hearings on S. 708 in the Public
Lands Subcommittee of the Senate. I look forward to reviewing
S. 708 in detail, and I assure you that I will keep your support
for such legislation prominent in my mind when it comes before
me.

Again, thank you for keeping me informed of your concerns.

Si c rely,

key \l'renching," by Dave Foreman

ree spikers may seem to have little to
do with Fawn Hall or Thoreau. but

ultimately they all pose the same mor- ‘

al dilemma.

Evidently as a gesture of protest. un-
known parties last summer inserted foot-
long spikes into some Mendocino (‘ounty
redwoods that were. scheduled to be
logged, pounding them in until they were
invisible. When the trees were felled and
hauled to a (‘loverdale lumber mill, the buzz
saw hit a spike,- which shattered the blade
and seriously injured mill worker George
Alexander.

The near tragic outcome of the illegal
protest raised the kind of profound ethical
issues that have been pondered by philosoé
pbcrs since Socrates:

Is it ever permissible to break the law?
(Let him who has never broken the Speed
limit cast. the first stone.)

ls ('l\ il disobedience ever justified? tile
member the Boston Tea Party.)

is it right to risk serious injury to some.
one. if you are acting on behalf of a good
cause? -

Do the ends justify the means?

One way to try to understand what mo-
tivates tree spikers is to examine your own
feelings under certain circumstances. if you
have lived in California very long, the odds
are you have seen some beloved natural
place destroyed by the bulldozers of prog-
ress —- a grove of trees, a wooded stream. an
open hillside. a meadow where the wildflow-
ers grew.

And chances are you boiled with rage.
You might even have contemplated in your
imagination some appropriate violence
against. the perpetrators. some exquisite

punishment to fit the crime.

I confess that my own fantasies against
nature killers have involved actions far
more drastic than tree spiking. But for bet-
ter or for worse. they remained fantasies.

- _ irect action. when all else fails, is an
* old American tradition, dating at
,. . least from the heave-ho affair in Bos-
ton Bay. When the institutions of society are
inadequate, when the bureaucrats and poli-
ticians turn a deaf car, when the courts say
that nothing can he done to stop the dam
age, when pleas and exhortations and ap-
peals all fail to protect basic values. Ameri-
cans have resorted to direct action of many
kinds.

1 have arbitrarily classified direct ac-‘

tion into several categories. Which of them,
if any, may be right, under what circum-
stances, dcpends on where you’re coming
from.

I Peaceful demonstrations. When mem-
bers of the radical environmental group
Earth First! dress in animal costumes and
stage a parade or media event to attract
attention to the destruction of certain spe
cics, they are engaging in the kind of free
dom of expression that anyone who sympa-
thizes with their aims can only applaud. (Sec
article on Page 12.) Even their Opponents
must allow them that right.

I Boycotts. Refusing to buy certain prod-
ucts, such as nonunion grapes or fast-food
hamburgers made at the expense of South
American rainforests —- to show disapproval
of the actions of the producers —- is a legally
acceptable statement of opposition.

 




I Refusal to pop (tires that support unetltt’.
ml or intmuml activity. Henry David Tho-
reau offered the prototype of this kind of
action in a democratic society.

The American colouists’ refusal to pay a

4 tea tax to King George was based on the
absence of dctnocracy taxation without
representation. Thoreau, however, was pro

testing actions of a duly elected govern ‘

mcnt, which permitted slavery and was wag

in; war on Mexico. He went to jail over-
night, but the next day friends paid his. taxes
(to his disgust), and he was evicted from the
lockup. His subsequent essay, “On Civil Dis-
obedience," is the classic statement of the
position.

I Non-violent resistance. This tactic in-
volves obstructing repugnant activities by
getting in the way, putting your body on the
line, refusing to move but offering no physi-
cal resistance to law enforcers. It was used
by Gandhi and his followers, by Martin Lu-
ther King in the civil-rights struggles. by
Greenpeace vessels sailing into nuclear tar-
get zones, and by the people who have
blocked the entrances to nuclear power
plants, weapons-testing sites and such instal-
lations as the Naval Weapons Depot at Con-
cord. where the amputation tragedy recent-
ly occurred.

Iftlmzkey wrenching. The name comes
from Edward Abbey’s novel, “The Monkey
Wrench Gang,” about eco-guerrillas who
among their milder activities put sand in the
gas tanks of bulldozers and pull up the
stakes oi highway surveyors.

This tactic involves damaging. stealing
or destroying property. In altering and
shredding government documents, Fawn
Hall, like her boss, was by definition a men.
key, wrencher. forced. she believed, to “go
above the law“ for reasons she felt compellr
ing. Eco-guerrillas offer the same defense.

I Spike-lg. I‘m using this as a generic term
for any action that is not primarily intended
to injure anyone but that involves the possi-
bility of injuries or fatalities as “deterrents“
to activity deemed to be undesirable.

All of these tactics may be used by peo
ple with the best of intentions who maintain
they are acting for reasons of conscience. in
the words of Oliver North’s wife: “His mo-
tives were pure.”

Both tree spikers and covert political
operators may violate the law on the as
sumption that the ends justify the means.
Marx and Lenin had some cogent thoughts
about. this proposition, and some of their
followers, at least, seemed willing to sacri-
fice anyone who stood in the way. The ends
are often some vague and faroff goal. such
as the “classless. society." but the means usu.
ally have dimt consequences. which ma;
be tiniiiiended

broke his jaw in five plat es and knocked out
several teeth. He narrowly escaped death.
Future victims may not be so lucky.

The spikers should ask themselves: Am i
willing to risk maiming or killing people to
save trees? The implicit answer seems to be
yes. and it makes the blood run cold to
contemplate where this philosotihy might
lead.

owever, the whole brouhaha over
tree spiking must also be seen
against the backdrop of a drastic up.
heaval in the Pacific Coast timber region.
Big conglomerates have taken over small
lumber companies that. had been Operated
by people with roots in the area. The abseno
tee—owned corporations, evidently more in

terested in a fast buck than in the social and
ecological health of the region, have greatly
speeded up logging by clear-cutting aimed
at liquidating the last of the old-growth (vir.
gin) timber.

“What now?" is a question increasingly
being asked by the region’s residents. The
cut-and-move-on tactics have already left
thousands of forest and mill workers with-
out jobs. The legacy of those methods in the
timber country, from Mendocino County to
British Columbia, is a rising tide of frustra-
tion and bitterness. It seems possible that
the spiking that injured George Alexander
was perpetrated by a local resident enraged
at the lumber companies, perhaps a fired
employee. Spiking is an old tactic in the
timber region, probably dating from labor
disputes in the 1870s

.In any case, members of Earth First!,
which has advocated tree spiking under cer-

tain circumstances, deny that the organiza
tion had anything to do with the action that
nearly killed Alexander.

"It isn‘t the kind of thing any of our
peeple would do,“ says Mike Roselle. an East
Bay resident and one of five founding mem-
bers of the organization. “We haven‘t done
any spiking in Northern California that I
know of. Any of our spikings involve old-
growth trees in wilderness areas, and we
always publicize in advance the stands that
have been spiked, so nobody needs to be
hurt. The logs that Alexander was working
were not from old-growth trees; they were
not from a wilderness; and there was no
warning.”

Environmentalists deplore the ongoing
removal of the last old-growth trees in na
tional forests and elsewhere because they
are a valuable resource far beyond their use
as timber. They contrast sharply with the
kinds of forests lumbermen prefer: even-
aged stands of a single species raised like a
crop and “harvested“ by clearcutting on a
40 to 8(iyear cycle.

a W“—!

A forest hundreds of years old has had
time to become a community of many spe
cies of trees, plants and animals. Goshawks,
spotted owls and other birds live primarily
in woods at least 200 years old. Elk and deer
find food and shelter in old-growth forests
during winters when clear-cut areas are un-
der snow. Salmon and steelhead spawn in
streams not silted by erosion from clear-cut-
ting.

Old-growth forests are useful for many
purposes — recreation, wildlife habitat, f ish-
ery protection, water conservation, scientif-
ic research and other “multiple uses" the
US. Forest Service is supposed to be. encour-
aging. Critics maintain that the forests are
being managed for timber cutting and that
all other uses get short shrift.

Logging is obviously essential if we are
to have lumber for building; the question is
how and where — and whether wiping out

the last old-growth forests by clearcutting is
in the best interest of anyone but the lumber
companies.

Earth First! members and other enti-
ronmentalists have sued the Forest Service.
charging it with neglecting its multipleuse
mandate under pressure from the lumber
industry. “But suits are expensive," says flo-
selle, “and we can‘t afford very many. A
lawsuit may cost $200,000. A box of spikes
costs $20.”

Roselle’s point is understandable but to
my mind dismayingly short-sighted. ‘icspite
all precautions. spikes can be killers. Spiking
trees is illegal, and breaking laws has conse-
quences not only for the individual but for.
society. Giving the individual the right to
decide which laws he is going to obey — and
which he will break —— is a recipe for anar-
chy.

Socrates. under Sentence of death in
Athens, refused the opportunity to escape
because to do so would be to renounce the
authority of law, which w as the basis for the
community that had nurtured him.

But what about the right of civil disobe-
dience? Thoreau and Gandhi and Martin
Luther King would argue that under ex-
treme circumstances, when a law violates
the conscience of the individual -— as in the
case of an unjust war or slavery or slave-like
conditions -— it must be disobeyed as a moral
duty. (It would be intriguing to hear a dia-
logue on this subject between Thoreau and
Socrates.) To what extent these ultimate
matters of conscience include the rights of
nature is a question that needs a great deal
more thought than anyone has yet given it.

There is a critical difference between
the nonviolent tactics of T horeau. Gandhi
and King and those of the tree spikcrs. The
spikes can be lethal -— and nearly were in
the case of Alexander.

have no respect for those who remain safelv
hidden while they put other people's lives
on the line.

Despite the admonitions by Earth First-
ers about the care to be used in tree spiking.
it seems naive to expect that everyone is
going to obey the rules. Advocating the
prOper use of tree spiking is like—advocating
the proper use of handguns: lnevitably not
everyone is going to comply, and somebody
is going to get killed.

Roselle admits that in promulgating
spiking, Earth l‘irst.’ must bear a share of the
responsibility for what may happen to mill
workers as a result: “but it's a risk you have
to take. Everything is risky. Logging is a
risky business."

Roselle also makes the point that spik~
ing and other (lirect-rn'tion tactics are the
most effective way, and sometimes the only
way, to call public attention to what is hap
pening in the timber country and other ar-
eas of environmental damage. Unfortunate-

ly. there is some truth in this argument; too

”AF

Roselle and his colleagues‘ actions placég
ingzother people in jeopardy might be seen
to be inspired by the new environmental
concept of “deep ecology.” Under-some in-
terpretations of this philosophy, humans
have no special status in the Earth’s econo,
my. T rees. birds, butterflies, fish and people

are co-equal members of the global commu-_

nity. . -

“.I don‘t think people are mere impor- ‘

tant than trees." Roselle says, “or-trees are
less important than people. That doesn’t
mean we should kill people the way we kill
trees for lumber. It means we have no right
to kill trees with wanton waste.”

I confess that I am unable to follow the
logic of this view. I am deeply convinced
that humans are members of the communi-
ty of life on Earth and that we need to
readjust all our affairs to recognize that fact,
but to say that all species in the community
are equal, and have the same rights, means
that you can‘t kill a virus or a mosquito
without committing murder, and that hu-
man life is worth no more than a weed in the
garden or a tree in the forest. Violence
against trees, in this argument, must be met
by tactics that lead to violence against peo-
ple. The implication is that although spiking
could kill mill workers, it would serve them
right for killing trees.

We can only assume that those who
hold this philosophy have not taken the
trouble to think through the consequences.
In this respect they differ little from those
who are stripping the forests, depleting the
soil, poisoning the air and water, and wiping
out other species in the greatest mass extinc-
tion since the age of the dinosaurs.

Violence begets violence; good intent
tions and pure motives do not sanctity do
structive actions -— whether the goal is anti-
Communism, the classless society or the
preservation of nature. \

Despite Fawn Hall, Colonel North and

Comrade Lenin, we cannot live by the rule
I

that the ends justify the means.

Legal solution sought

Dog—bite victims
trying to organize

By Steve Friedman

 

OF THE HOUSTON POST

Eight-year-old Alyssa Heath
hasn’t slept through an entire
night since the summer. She fears
' something bad will happen, and
in her nightmares, she is always
the victim.

Alyssa was attacked by a mixed
chow in August.

A neighbor’s dog latched onto
her face and kept biting. When
the animal finally let go, an eyelid
was dangling and deep gashes
were left on her cheekbone and
upper and lower lips.

“When it first happened, we
were in shock. We knew she had
severe physical damage,” said
Alyssa’s mother, Becky Heath.

“But not having talked to any-
body, we had no idea of the psy-
chological effects.”

Heath wants to see a group
formed to help similar victims
know what to expect and to lobby
for more effective laws against vi-
cious dogs.

Heath may see that wish
turned into reality in January,
when a victims’ advocacy group
in Houston is scheduled to hold
its first planning meeting.

The movement toward forming
the yet untitled group was
sparked by Dr. Robert Arm-
strong, who heads the city’s ani-
mal control department.

“We’re just going to discuss
the feasibility,” Armstrong said.

“it would have to start from the
victims themselves. They’d have
to do it. We envision something
much like MADD (Mothers
Against Drunk Driving).

“Right now, I’m the only per-
son who represents these peo-
ple,” Armstrong said. “These
people have a message that needs
to be hear c

That they’re not being heard
was evident at a recent meeting
of the Houston City Council.

About 20 people spoke against

Armstrong’s proposal that the city
adopt an ordinance requiring
owners of chow and pit bulldogs

, to carry $100,000 in liability in-

surance to cover any injuries
caused by their pets.

No victims were there to speak
in favor of the proposal, even
though the dog owners’ lack of
insurance is perhaps the largest
problem victims face.

A council committee on dan~
gerous animals is scheduled to
consider the proposal Monday.

Only if the dog owner has
homeowner’s insurance will the
victim’s medical bills be covered.
Since many of the dogs are
owned by renters, the victims
usually have to pay their ‘own
medical costs and then attempt to
recover their money through the
courts.

“These people have to put
their faces back together,” Arm-
strong said. “But the pit bulldog
owner never seems to have the
deep pockets.”

Albert Dworkin, an attorney
representing three dog-bite vic-
tims, said, “People who have
been affected will not come for-
ward. They may be in favor (of
legislation), but because they are
not in an organized group, it be-
comes that much more difficult to
talk about a major trauma in their
lives.”

Dworkin believes the planned
group could help solve that prob-
lem.

A client of Dworkin’s, Raylene
Smith, said she does not favor the
group as a lobbying organization.
but does think it could be useful
as a support group for victims.

Smith was savagely attacked by
two pit bulls as she left treatises»
ton home in Novemberldggi. A
neighbor tried to help: {me her,
but then the neighbor was at-
tacked. A 16—year-old t {malty
was able to get the women ire of

the dogs.

When the attack was over, Smith
had deep cuts on an arm, her upper
torso, a leg and an ankle. Flesh had
been pulled from her body clear
through to a bone.

Since the attack, Smith has be-
come something of a national fig-
ure in the movement to control vi-
cious dogs. She's been seen on
Oprah Winfrey’s television show,
Good Morning America and other
programs.

“I was hoping to let people
know how dangerous these ani—
mals are,” Smith said of her ap-
pearances.

While her religion prevents her

from working for political pur-
poses, Smith readily admits from
her own experiences that a support
group is invaluable in dealing with
the tr’auma of an attack.

”I had a good support group in
my congregation,” Smith said. “It
really helped.”

Smith said she might have
turned to a group of victims for
support as she recovered, if one
had been available.

Now that a group is in the works
and Smith is a survivor, she said,
“I'd like to help others who are
forced to go through this. I'm very
fortunate that they did not get to
my face.

“I feel sorry for those children
who weren't as fortunate."

‘ Stricter laws take aim at dang

’7 , By Pete Wittenborg
’OF THE HOUSTON POST

 

Sympathy for stricter measures
' against vicious dogs is growing
among US. cities, but outright
banishment of a dangerous breed
is an idea that has yet to take
hold.

New York City is writing what
Charles Epstein, counsel to the
health commissioner, makes no
bones about calling “pit bull leg-

islation.”

”It is specifically aimed at pit
bulls,” Epstein said.

However, "singling 'out one
breed has been deemed unconsti-
tutional,” said Bruce Truitt,
spokesman for the Austin-Travis
County Health Department. “It’s
an extension of the innocent-un-
til-proven-guil rule.”

Houston’s r. Robert Arm-
strong, chief of the Bureau of An—
imal Regulation and Care, said

the 14th Amendment stricture
against depriving a person of
property without due process is a
dog owner’s best friend.

“No city has banned a breed
yet,” Armstrong said.

What New York is attempting
is an ordinance regulating the
sale of pit bulls, requiring they be

nned, muzzled and registered,

pstein said.

Only after an owner has failed
to comply with those require-

ments could a dog be banned
from the city and the owner fined
up to $5,000, he said.

After further violations, a dog
could be impounded for one year
or killed, Epstein said.

Austin’s current dog law also
allows for banishment, but only
after a dog has attacked some-
one, been held for rabies obser-
vation and determined to be vi-
cious, Truitt said.

“A state bill which took effect

 

 

’

are quite encouraged," he said.

While state law requires insur—
ance only after a dog has attacked
someone, Houston’s proposal
would require insurance simply for
ownership of specific breeds.

Armstrong said his proposal. for
Houston would be tougher than the
state law by regulating pit bulls and
chows from the outset, although
not banning them.

“We would say that any breed of
animal with twice the normal num—
ber of attack incidents (such as pit
bulls and chows) needs insur-
ance,” Armstrong said.

He also is recommending a
$100,000 policy.

San Antonio is revising its regu-
lations, which currently provide a
$200 fine after one bite with no
confinement of the dog required.

“It’s really aimed at pit bulls, but
we can’t say so because it’s uncon-
stitutional," said Assistant City At-
torney Susan Rocha.

Under a new proposal, a dog is
deemed vicious after one biting in-

 

cident. Various conditions would
then have to be met for keeping
the dog, including payment of a
$2,000 fine.

A dog could be killed after an-
other violation, Rocha said.

Denver has a more ”definitive"
dog law as a result of a fatal pit bull
attack last year, said Assistant City
Attorney April Snook.

“It’s not a one-free-bite law. No i

biting is allowed. An owner was
fined $250 because a pit bull, out
of its fence, growled and frightened
a woman. The fine was suspended.
If there is another violation, the
whole fine must be paid. If the dog
bites someone, it can be put to
sleep," Snook said.

In Oklahoma City, “we require
all animals be in a confined area or
on a leash,” said Assistant City At-
torney Mike Fischer.

“if there's a vicious attack, we

take the dog in. If it bites someone,
we can go to court to euthanize .IL"
Fischer said there has been little

support in Oklahoma City for a “pit

specifically vicious breeds.

Vancouver city council has ordered pit~
fbull terriers and other vicious dogs
itmuzzled. '
The aldermen are also demanding that
V'Victoria give municipalities the power to
evict and ban the breed or any dog that has
{pit-bull blood.
“ The moves followed a raucous Council

meeting last night in which dog owners pil-.

loried the politicians. '

“You’re being swept along in a wave of
hysteria created by the media," said an
angry Dave Reynolds of the Pit Bull Associa-
tion of B.C. _

Other pit-bull lovers screamed that the
council was on a “witch hunt."

“No, I’m on a dog hunt,” snapped Ald.
George Puil in the face of a barrage of taunts
and jeers. “l have no hesitation at all about
banning this breed from the streets.” I

Council amended the pound bylaw, requir-
ing all vicious dogs in the city to be muzzled
and leashed. Pit bulls and pit-bull crosses

are defined as vicious.

But SPCA director Michael Weks said
council doesn‘t know what it’s doing and the
proposed ban would be unenforceable.

- .“They’ve been taken for a ride by the
media,” said Weks.

Pit-bull owner Mitchell Milo said his dog
Nakima would never hurt a fly. And he said
the new rules would condemn his “little girl
to a life in chains -— in prison." '

Other municipalities across B.C. and the
rest of Canada are also considering banning
the savage terriers and muzzling others.

Earlier this week the city council in Lon-

don, Ont., voted to consider banning the

dogs. The moves have followed several
highly publicized attacks by the dogs.

I Last month, police in Vancouver shot a
pit bull that attacked two officers investigat-
ing an attempted murder.

Poetry

Just for You

THE DOG
The dog is such a friendly beast,
The humblest fare to him a feast.
His greatest joy to romp and
roam,
’Til master whistles him back
home.

His shaggy head such wisdom
knows
who are friends and who are
foes,
No jealous pride of race or creed
found to haunt his honest breed.

A gentler heart his warm coat
cloaks,
han found among most human \
folk.

His great courage has oft been
told,

None nobler lives on earth’s large
fold.

ATLANTA JOURNAL AND CONSTITUTION - January 3 , 1988

Orphaned black bears briefly share

human habitat until return to wild

The Associated Press

BLOUNTSTOWN, Fla. — As far
as three orphaned black bear cubs
are concerned, Betsy Knight is their
mama.

The Florida Panhandle woman
feeds natural foods such as grapes,
berries and persimmons to bear
brothers named Luke and Zeke,
whose mother was found dead in
the mountains of northern Georgia,
and Mandy, abandoned in a trash
can at the Ocala National Forest.

Mrs. Knight is the only human
allowed near the cubs, and her own
contact is limited. in order to pre-
vent them from becoming tame.

Her goal, shared with state
wildlife authorities in Florida and
Georgia and the Tallahassee-based
St. Francis Wildlife Association, is
to return the cubs to the wild once
they are old enough, about 7 or 8
months, to fend for themselves.

They will remain in a fenced
enclosure in the Knight family’s
back yard for another month or two.
Luke and Zeke will be set free
somewhere in southern Georgia and
Mandy back in the Ocala forest.

Mrs. Knight is the first, and so
far the only. person in the Sunshine
State who has raised cubs that were
successfully returned to the wild,
said Jim Brady, supervisor of the
Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission‘s Wildlife Re-
search Laboratory in Gainesville.

Bears are only the latest and
largest of many species Mrs. Knight
and other St. Francis members have
released after rescuing injured, sick
or orphaned animals and birds.

“If we could prove it could be
done, it would open the doors up
for the freedom of other bear cubs,”
said Mary Jane Shaw, St. Francis
founder, in Tallahassee. Otherwise,
she said. they would be condemned
for the rest of their lives to cages in
zoos or tourist attractions.

The effort began two years ago
when wildlife officials brought Mrs.
Knight three orphaned cubs that
eventually were set free in the
Ocala National Forest. St. Francis
purchased the $3000 enclosure and
paid for food. It costs about $2,000
to raise each cub. Mrs. Knight said.

Radio transmitters attached to
but of the cubs indicated they had
adapted to their natural environ
ment: The transmitters fell off after
illIlC or 10 months as planned.

One cub later was struck by a
car and killed while crossing a
highway. An examination of her

stomach contents revealed she had:
been feeding on the same kinds of 5

natural foods the cubs were given
while at the Knight home.

The third cub apparently had
been in captivity at a roadside 200
for too long before she was confis—
cated and turned over to Mrs.
Knight. She remained too tame to
make it in the wild.

A few days after the third cub
was released, she approached some
humans who petted her and fed her
people food. She was recaptured
and placed in an animal attraction
in the Wildwood, Fla, area, Brady
said.

When the first cubs were
brought to Mrs. Knight, officials had
asked her to raise them for future
placement in captivity. But she
agreed to take them only if they
were returned to the wild, citing
successful releases the year before
in Tennessee.

“We came to an agreement," she
said. “The bears would be raised on
their natural food away from human

. contact. My children aren’t even al-

lowed back there.”

Mrs. Knight and her husband.
Philip, an assistant state attorney,
have four children, ranging in age
from 9 to 24, and one grandchild.

Their home is a menagerie of

.‘wild animals, including a fox, owls

and a sparrow named “Hot Shot.”

At times, the menagerie has in-
cluded deer, beavers, opossums,

raccoons, foxes, bobcats, turtles,

hawks and an otter that tried the
family’s patience with antics such
as hiding a fish that smelled up the
bathroom. 1

A hallmark of St. Francis is that
it will take any native wild animal,
but there are some. limitations in.
the Knight household.

“I absolutely put my foot down
on alligators, snakes and buzzards,”

said Philip Knight. I

. . . I am supportive of the draft-

We have laws that provide pun-

These laws assure us that we are
innocent until proven guilty, and

Then a responsible and reason—

be “that a dog, regardless of his

be found either innocent or gmlty
depending on the crime that he has
committed.”

Fur

On pages 8 and 9 of section H
(“Haute Houstonian”) of the Dec.
10 Post, I noticed a $15,000 62—
skin Lunaraine mink coat by Gi-
venchy. There were eight other
natural fur coats shown on these
pages, including a blue-dyed,
sheared beaver jacket (men’s)
with “Oilers” on the back for
$5,500.

1 should be very surprised if all
the anti-hunting, anti-cruelty to an-
imals factions don’t ﬂood Ashby’s
desk with letters (yours too, S-O
editor!) decrying the brutality of
hunting these poor dumb creatures
for fun and profit.

Fact is, the protests usually go
on only until the protester (usually
female) can afford her own coat!

During a normal lifetime,
most women can never afford
one of those coats and wouldn’t
have any use for it if they could.

Canada Bans Most Seal Kills ‘ l
After Big Protests

Toaoirm, Dec. 31 .(AP) ~— Canada
has, banzwi all offshore commercial
hunting: at white-coated baby harp
seals anti- itiueback hooded seals after
European threats of trade reprisals
and redaced demand for seal pelts.

The decision, announced Wednesda
night, pleased environmental group
and angered fishermen in Newfound-
landwho depend on the annual spring
hunt. .. a. .; up... .. . , . .. .

The ban applies to young and mature
seals from both species, but among
harp seals, only baby seals had been
hunted for their pelts. The sight of men
clubbing baby seals to death .had
prompted an international anti-sealing
' campaign. ‘ .

The Government also imposed a ban
for 1988 on hunting gray seals, which
are killed not for pelts but because they
kill fish and spread parasites. Canada
has several other species of seal that
are notwidely hunted, and the ban does
not apply to them. , . . .

Eskimos living off the land and other
coastal hunters were exempted from
the ban, but were asked to hunt. older
seals.

Fisheries Minister Tom Siddon said
a research program would determine

“that long-tetmﬁheasurés might be re-

TAMPA TRIBUNE - December 19, 1987

Appeal court ruling OKs sale
of stray animals for research

[By JIM SLOAN
Tribune Staff Writer

‘ TAMPA - An appeal court Fri-
day entered a final footnote to Hills-
borough County’s bitter fight over
. the use of stray pound animals for
medical research.

The 2nd District Court of Appeal

reversed a circuit court ruling that

banned sales of stray and unwanted
pound animals to the University of
South Florida Medical School.

The Hillsborough' County Com-
mission, however, had sldestepped
the ban in January by revising its

Animal Control ordinance to allow ‘

“pound seizure.” _.

The issue pitted animal rights
activists against USF medical re-
searchers last year in a bitter battle
. that spurred threats, emotional pub-
lichearings and a lopsided public
referendum.

Phil Snyder; executive director
of the Humane Society of Tampa
Bay, filed suit in September 1986,
seeking an injunction against the
county’s 26-year policy of selling un-
claimed pound animals to USF.

Circuit Judge Vernon ' Evans
ruled in October 1986 that the coun-
ty’s ordinance allowed the pound to

“dispose of animals only by lethal in-
jection and permanently banned »

further sales to USF.

In January, the County Commis-
sion revised its ordinance to permit
the practice to continue, and voters
gave their stamp of approval in
March. . ‘

The commission also appealed

.Evans’ ruling. On Friday, nearly a

year later, the appellate court re-
versed Evans’ ruling on a technical-
ity.

der ruled that Snyder did not have
legal standing to. sue the county
over the issue.

Snyder, -- Ryder said, “had nei-
ther proven nor argued” that he suf-
fered any “special injury” fromthe
county policy. ’

The court. also noted that be-
cause the county already had re-
vised its ordinance to allow pound
seizure, “the concerns of the trial
court no, longer exist.”

 

Acting Chief Judge Herboth Ry?

Chief Assistant'County Attorney
Emeline Carswell Acton said the
ruling is significant, even if the is-
sue Was settled months ago.

“A lot of people said I shouldn’t
even appeal it,” Acton said of Ev-
ans’ ruling. f‘But I was concerned
about the issue of standing. If the
executive directors of all these in-
terest groups can sue us every time
they don’t like an ordinance, we’ll
be in court all the time.” .

Acton, who argued the county’s
case before the appellate court, said
the ruling also reaffirms the coun-
ty’s policy of selling unwanted and
stray animals to USF.

“The cOurt has said, in effect,
that the practice is permissible un-
der the current ordinance,” she
said. “If someone challenges that
ordinance, we can use the court’s
opinion as a defense.” -

Snyder said he is disappointed
that the court didn’t rule on the key
issue in his suit: whether using stray
animals for medical experimenta-
,'tion was a humane way (If disposing
’of them. .

‘2 “It was too bad they didn’t make
a statement on that,” he said. “They
made a statement on a very minor
technical point.”

Snyder also rejected the court’s
argument that he was not damaged

j as a result of pound seizure.

: Because of fears that a dog or
‘; cat would be used for research, res-
:idents began taking animals to the

 

 

Humane Society Executive Di-
rector Phil Snyder said the
court ignored the key issue.

Humane Society, Snyder said. The
number of strays the agency accept-
ed shot up from 800 to 4,000 a year,
he said. ‘ . , g

The cost of caring for those ani-
mals, he said, was one of the factors
that pushed the agency to the brink
of financial ruin this year.

“Due to the financial burden, we
no longer accept lost (and stray ani-
mals,” Snyder said. “I certainly felt
that was just cause to sue.”

USF joined the county in appeal-
ing Evans’ ruling. Sally Padgett, a
spokeswoman for the university,
said she was delighted by Friday’s‘
ruling.

“This completely sets aside any
emotional feelings and, purely in le-
galistic terms, evaluates the case,”
she said.

ATLANTA JOURNAL AND CONSTITUTION - December 28, 1987

I t’s a dog’s life for cat owners, but we’re

Why do pe0ple who would shudder to
read about the torture death of a child be-
have so differently when the victim is a cat?
Why are they always clipping and quoting
grisly news items about cats for their cat-
owning friends?

This is, it seems to me, one of the great
mysteries of our time. Particularly since
57.8 million cats occupy honored places in
US. homes, making them far more popular
than America’s 49.4 million dogs.

Cats are passive creatures, endlessly
grooming themselves, fascinating to watch,
more fastidious in their personal habits than

some of the pe0ple with whom they live.‘

Still, they elicit far more animosity than
man’s “best” friend, the dog.

What is it about cats that brings out the
worst in people? It’s hard to believe the
jokesters mean any real harm. Probably,
they think there is something intrinsically

funny about the drowning of a cat with a

marked resemblance to your own. Perhaps

they discount the possibility of any actual af-

fection deveIOping between a human being .

and a feline.

Dead-cat stories, a staple of every radio
dee-jay, are told in polite company. And
there seems to be even more interest in
them, ironically, this time of year, when
songs of brotherly love and heavenly peace
are on so many lips. -

Ask any bookseller. People will not only
go out and spend money for a book with a ti-
tle like “101 Uses For a Dead Cat;” they will
most likely do so in the weeks between
Thanksgiving and Christmas. They will laugh
and laugh at the pictures, and congratulate
themselves on having found the “perfect”
gift for a' cat-loving friend. (Later, they will
accuse the poker-faced recipient of being a
humorless stick-in-the-mud who can’t take a
joke).

 

Episodes of cruelty to animals also
abound now. Just the other morning, I ar-
rived at work to discover that a long-haired
cat had been kidnapped, doused with gaso-
line and set afire by four fun-loving North
Carolina boys in a prank that an apparently
unrepentant 16-year-old described as “really
funny (until) the law got here.”

Lucky for me, my colleagues know I
share my home with, and have gotten quite

fond of, two cats, one of them a long-hair.“ " 1.

Cat, 1 7, makes

300-mile trek

BLANCHARD, La. (AP) — A
17—year-old cat given a retirement
home in suburban New Orleans
somehow got across the Mississippi
and Red rivers on a BOO-mile trek
to her old home in northwestern
Louisiana.

“Her feet were muddy and the
bottom of her paws were worn, but
she looks a lot better now,” the
Rev. J.C. Cox of Blanchard said of
his house pet ChiChi, who returned
in time for Christmas.

Cox said he opened his garage
door Sunday and found the weary
cat, three weeks after she disap-
peared from her new home in Me—
tairie, La.

Cox said he had given ChiChi to
his granddaughter, who is crazy
about cats. “I thought the cat was
getting a good home, sort of a re- .
tirement home,” he said Monday.

After just a week in her new
home, ChiChi disapeared.

He said ChiChi acted a little
strangely at first after returning,
“like she didn’t know if she was
going to stay.”

But he said the cat has calmed
down and resettled into her old
home. “I guess she’ll stay with us
another 17 years.”

Cox is stumped as to how the cat
crossed the broad Mississippi.

 

I

day in blissful ignorance of any such thing.
Though the story didn’t make the paper, one
of the editors went out of his way to trans-
mit it to my computer, before zapping it
from his own. What a way to start the day.

Over the years, my VDT has also been
the unwitting courier of stories about the use
of domesticated cats for heart and parasite
research at Emory and the University of
Georgia; the Defense Department’s shooting
of live animals for “research” into the treat-
ment of human gun wounds; an 18th-century
Anglican tradition in which an effigy of the
pope, filled with live cats, was set afire as a
bit of Guy Fawkes Night merriment; bow-
and-arrow attacks on cats in a Marietta
apartment complex; the skinning and mutila-
tion of live' pet cats in Savannah, and more.

I would no sooner joke about such things
with a cat owner than I would about wife-
beating with a newlywed. or child abuse with

{ making some real progress

9 Otherwise, I might have breezed through the

a parent. But cats seem to constitute an ac-
ceptable target, maybe even a buffer, for the
cruelest impulses of otherwise decent people.

Eventually, a cat owner learns to steel
herself against such things, to soft-peddle her
cat connection in hapes that pe0ple will for-
get. It’s almost always the person who really
dotes on her cat (letting Whiskers sleep at
the foot of her bed, talking about the cute
things he does) who is the brunt of such sa-
distic humor, and not the person who ap-
pears to just tolerate a cat in her household.

But every now and then, there’s a bit of
holiday cheer for cat lovers. An item no ailu-
r0phobe (look it up) will ever bring to your
attention. Like the recent bulletin from new
1y prosperous Beijing, where the cat owners
finally outnumber the cat eaters. It’s called
progress. D

The Houston Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
is seeing a troubling and unwel-
come phenomenon this Christ-
mas season: There’s little room at
the inn as HouStonians in record
numbersiare giving their pets up
, for adoption because they’re too

_ much trouble.

“They’re going out of town or
{they re havmg relatives in and
Ethey don’t want to mess with -7‘
{their pets. We see a lot of lame «
excuses,” said Patricia Mercer .7
_;executive director of the SPCA. ’

cer said. Nonnally, animals are
housed for weeks or months wait-
ing for adoption.

Housing is especially tight for
adult dogs and cats, Mercer said.

To make matters worse, the cen-
ter is bracing for the after-Christ—
mas rush when people who were
given pets as Christmas gifts de-
cide they don’t want them.

Executive vice president Dr.
Robert 0. Shannon attributed the
glut partially to the sour economy,

which pinches most people more
at Christmas.
But Mercer said many people

{ have left adult dogs and cats for
-_ adoption this week, saying they are

leaving town for vacation and don’t
want to pay to have the pet
boarded or arrange to have some-
one look in on the animal.

Some people have asked wheth—
er “donating” an animal qualifies
them for an income tax deduction,
Mercer said. Others have said
they’ve redecorated and their pets

clash with the new furniture.
“These are people who look at

animals as disposable,” Mercer

said. “It makes us quite angry.”
The SPCA also receives more re—

_ quests for adoptions this time of

year, however, as peopleare
moved by the Christmas spmt to
save a dog or cat from death and
give it a home, Mercer said. .

The Houston Humane Soc1ety
has seen no increase in the number
of animals this season, a spokes-
man said.

let Us Pray for the Animals

 

We gave them minks, but they’ve lost their souls 3

 

hat do dogs and cats
really want? Until re-
cently, that question

was hardly ever asked, except
in the narrowest sense by the
people who make pet food. Yet
it is clear that a society which
forces dogs to wear yarmulkes
must sooner or later confront
the aspirations of its pets.
In California, human psychics
have already begun to probe
the inchoate thoughts of pets,
for $40 to $60 a session. What
dark passions, undreamed-of in
the laboratories of Ralston Pur-
ina, lurk beneath their velour
jogging suits? Is it a F austian
bargain they haVe made, that
they will get to live in condo-
miniums instead ofhollow logs,
and in exchange will have to
wear cologne to match their
owners’? Have we made them
over in our own image? Or
merely dressed them that way?

A decade or so ago, this ques-
tion wouldn’t have arisen. That
was before a fashion retailer
named Ilene Hochberg couldn’t
ﬁnd attractive, warm winter
clothing for her white terrier
and originated a line of Dog-
wear originals, which runs
from sweaters under $30 to the
$150 custom-tailored, brass-
buttoned ”Karl Dogerfeld”
coat. From the clothes came the
books: “Dogue” (1986) and last
year’s "Catmopolitan,” heavy-
handed satires of fashion maga—
zines, which nevertheless con-
tain a wealth of information on
outﬁtting your pet as a living
fashion accessory. If anyone is an authority
on the changing role of dogs and cats in
American society, it ought to be Hochberg,
yet even she regards the issue from the
human point of View. She describes her
designs as "an emulation of what was prev-
alent in people fashion.” ”An animal,” to
Hochberg, "is an expression of one’s self.”

So we don’t really know what dogs and
cats think as they are trotted through
stores like The Pet Set, a salon/ boutique in
a suburban neighborhood of Atlanta that
will do an estimated $1 million in business
this year. All we can do is watch them as

‘ than the dog’s.

Yes, Hochberg is clearly on the right
track here. Much more so than her erst-

; while publisher, Martin Greif, editorial di-
’ rector of The Main Street Press, who sees

pets offering a subliminal connection to
“the real world” in an era when people "are
completely divorced from nature.” A dog
wearing $12-a-pair underpants from the
Pet Department in Los Angeles—so he
won’t wet the leather upholstery in his
owner’s Jaguar—would last about ﬁve
minutes in nature.

Years of evolution: The same is true for the
yapping animals lined up for the $8 prz'x
ﬁxe lunch (liver paté, cheese logs, shep-
herd’s pie) at Famous Fido’s Doggie Deli in
Chicago, an institution whose motto is:
“We do not serve dog and cat food. We
serve food to dogs and cats.” In fact, only
dogs are actually served, since owner Glo-
ria Lissner has observed that "cats cannot
sit at a table and dine; they’re too nerv-
ous.” Just imagine that. Forty million
years of evolution leading to the exquisite
predator known as a cat, and you can’t
even get a decent table at lunch.

Do they mind? Do Winnie, Sadie and
Biscquit—schnauzer triplets belonging to
Beverly Hills kennel owner Cathi Helfer—
object to walking around with their initials

clipped into the fur on the side
of their bodies? What do the
other dogs think? It is fair to
say that they are not fooled by
Helfer’s naming her institution
a "camp,” to relieve the guilt
owners feel about sending their
pets to a ”kennel.” But what
about dogs who go to a "spa,”
like The Argyle, in a rural
setting north of Dallas? There
———while their owners watch
on closed-circuit TV ——massage
therapists like Mo Ackley give
pets facials, a process she de-
scribes as “not much different
than for humans. It’s 15 min—
utes of working the muscles in
the face from the bridge of the nose, over

j the head and down the neck. Some animals
2 will sit still longer than others, but they all
seem to love it.”

Is that conclusive evidence, then? Have
we in fact created a race of animals that can
look at a rabbit and think only of how nice
its fur would feel in the hood of a parka?
Are there no dogs left to remember that
even a $100 Swaine Adeney Brigg & Sons

mals are among some 7,000 horses
now in federal corrals across the
country, where they await adoption

by people willing to pay up to $125 '

each for them.

But in recent years, the govern-
ment’s horse inventory has in-
creased as the number of paid adop-

tions has declined. With the gov-i

ernment’s annual bill for feeding
the horses now more than $7 mil-
' 110%, a sharp debate has grown over
the "program and, specifically, over
whether the government should be
able to use euthanasia to dispose of
surplus horses. .
“When we're cutting programs
for the poor in this country, should
we be feeding excess wild horses?”
Robert Burford, the director of the

Bureau of Land Management, asked
recently. ‘Someone needs to bite

the bullet.”_

The Bureau of Land Manage- '
ment, which administers the pro- i
gram, argues that public sentiment ‘

on behalf of the animals is forcing
the government to spend millions
of dollars to tend horses nobody
wants. He cited the findings of a
special advisory panel last year that
recommended using euthanasia to
dispose of horses not adopted after
90 days. - "

But animal protection groups .
and others oppose killing the ani- ’
mals, arguing that the surplus of ‘
captured horses is a problem of the

government’s own making.
Since 1973 the government has
placed with private families and

ranchers about 70,000 of the 90,000 :

Critics say the government is
rounding up too many wild horses,
many of them old and infirm, to as-
suage the interests of ranchers in
the West. The ranchers have long
regarded the animals as a nuisance
because they graze on land the
ranchers lease as pasture for cattle
and sheep. '

Moreover, in a lawsuit filed in
Nevada last year, the Animal Pro-
tection institute of America, an or-
ganization based in Sacramento,
Calif, asserted that most of the
horses that were placed by the gov-
arﬁinent last year were not adopted.

ﬁnder current regulations, any
person who takes a wild horse must

wait a full year before receiving le-
. gal title to it. Once someone has

title to the animal, they presumably
are permitted to sell the animals to
slaughterhouses, which normally
pay from $220 to $250 for a 1,000
pound animal.

Robert Hillman, an official with
the Animal Protection institute of
America, said the Bureau of Land
Management policy on horses was
tailored to suit the interests of cat-
tle ranchers. “The idea is, just do

 

century, it was enough to bring a
growing tide of complaints from
cattle and sheep ranchers.

As a result, Congress tripled the
budget for the roundup program to
nearly $17 million in 198s, and the

, number of horses in the corrals

jumped. The Bureau of Land Man-
agement estimates there are about

, 44,000 horses on the range today, a
. number. that officials would like to

reduce to about 30,000.

Meanwhile, John Boyles, chief of
the Division of Wild Hoses and Bur-
ros in the land management
agency, said the government has
.not been as successful in finding

people willing to adopt the animals

ﬁat a cost of $125. In fiscal year 1985,

more than 9,500 horses and wild
burros were adopted. The next year,
the number dropped to 7,600, and in
the last fiscal year, the number of

"adoptions for which fees were paid
was fewer than 5,000.

The advisory panel agreed that
the government needed to develop
“an aggressive adoption policy, and
seek approval for use of paid adver-
tising when free advertising cannot
be obtained.”

Wolf‘return , plan Opposed

Ranchers fear predator’s reintroduction to Yellowstonewl

By Patrick Dawson

BILLINGS, Mont. -— Rancher Dan
Geer spotted a wolf on a hill near
his house that morning as he was
climbing in his pickup to drive 400
miles to the Montana Wool Growers
Association convention in Billings.

The light was good, he recalled,
and he was sure it wasn’t the fugi-

tive adult wolf from the pack that
’ had raided his livestock. It was a
new threat.

With the wolf almost at his door,

Geer was reluctant to leave his .

ranch, but he had to come tell his
story.
Most years the talk at the wool

growers gathering is of lamb-killing .

coyotes and golden eagles. At the
meeting earlier this month, it was of
the wolf.

Wolves were once thought to be
extinct in this part of the country,
wiped out over a half-century ago by
bounty hunters and government
trappers. Like the methodical
slaughter of the buffalo, the demise
of the wolf was yet another chapter
in the white man’s takeover of the
West.

But the wolf has been in the spot-
light again recently, mainly because
of suggestions that it be reintro-
duced to Yellowstone National Park
and other areas. That plan was
thwarted this summer by Wyoming

congressmen sympathetic. to the '

livestock industry, but it is still
being considered.

Few people alive today can re-
member when wolves .roamed the
land, killing livestock. But Geer, for
One, can testify that they still exist.

“We got plenty of ’em,” he told
the Wool Growers Association.
“They’re not extinct, if you’re wor-
ried about that. ‘There are a lot of
them in Canada. It’s a good source
for providing our wolves.”

Geer lost two yearling cattle and
10 head of sheep this summer to a

pack of wolves that apparently had I
crossed the border from Canada to ‘

Greer’s ranch on the Blackfeet In-
dian Reservation east of Glacier Na-
tional Park.

Once he was able to prove to ,
’ wildlife officials that wolves were 5

killing his livestock, government
trappers began a hunt that led to the
killing of three adult wolves and
two pups. '

“We got plenty of ’em.
They’re not extinct, if
you’re\worried about

that. There are a lot of

them in Canada. It’s a

‘ good source for

providing our wolves.” '
— Dan Geer, rancher

 

The wolf is listed as an endan-
gered species, protected by federal
law, so Geer risked a fine and jail
time had he taken vigilante action

. against the animals. ' ' -

The government does not com-
pensate stockmen for losses to

‘ wolves. But Geer was paid $2,239 for l

the animals he lost by Defenders of

Wildlife, a national organization ,

that wants to bring wolves back to
Yellowstone.

Geer said the money didn’t quite
pay for acquiring new stock, “but if
you need the money, it’s a damn
nice thing to have.”

The politics of the wolf ' issue

bring out powerful emotions in live-
stock country. The ranchers do not

want their animals endangered by
wolvesBut ranchers face a national
lobby for the wolf, an ancient sym-
bol of the wilderness. .

As Congress renews“ the 1973 En-
dangered Species Act, sheep and cat-
tle producers are expecting the Wyo-

ming senators .to intervene to ex- ;

empt the wolf from federal
protection. Earlier this month, how-

'ever, Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.,

‘ reintroduce a few breeding pairs of

.. natural order as a predator of elk,

 

 

failed in his attempt {WemoVe the
wolf from the list as the renewal
. went through the House. _
Meanwhile, Rep. Wayne Owens,
’ﬂUtah, who grew up on a sheep
ranch, is sponsoring a bill calling
for the reintroduction of 50 to ISO

. wolves in Yellowstone within three

years.

“There is no documented history
of a wolf attacking a human in west-
ern America,” Owens said, “and our
plan would call for the reimburse-
ment to the ranchers for any cow or
sheep killed. The wolves would feed
on the abundant wildlife, especially
the 36,000 elk and more than 2,000
bison that wander the sanctuary ‘
during the summer months.”

It has been a long-range plan of
the National Park Service and the
US. Fish and Wildlife Service to

wolves. into the wilderness areas of
northwest Montana, central Idaho
and, first, Yellowstone, where the
wolf would retake its place in the

 

 

 

 

.deer and bison.
The plan originally had the sup-l

' port of William Penn Mott, director

of the National Park Service, but he
was stymied after Wyoming’s all-Re-
publican congressional delegation
opposed it.

- Frank D e, director of the
Fish and Wi dlife Service, officially
approved his agency’s Northern
Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery
Plan but recently told livestock
owners that he would use every bu-
reaucratic trick necessary to sub-
vert it. Dunkle also asked Mott in a
memo not to let the Park Service

5”“ rm.”- .. w

promote the wolf-in-Yellowstone
‘ plan.

.~—_-—..

Still, because of the bill pending
in Congress and support from organ-
izations such as “Defenders of Wild-

 

life and the Audubon Society, the
wolf issue is still alive.

“We still have the political clout,
but we’re up against some tough
guys -- big guns,” said Joe Belle of

Dillon, Mont, chairman of the Na
tional Wool Growers Environmental
Committee. “We can’t go to sleep.”

But supporters of the plan said it

is a key test of the nation’s commit-

ment to helping endangered species. ‘

Mr Gummer said {WC
scientists maintained there

kill the Minkes to assess whale
populations.

But, the expedition—which
consists of a huge factory ship,

smaller hunting vessels— has
only four scientists from the
Japan Cetacean Research

A DIPLOMATIC row has

and Japan over Tokyo’s

from Greenpeace which has
protested strenuously against
the expedition, say this is
whaling ‘ under a different
name.’

This view is backed by Mr
Gummer. ‘ We support the
opinion of the IWC’s own
scientists and they have said
unequivocally that there is no
scientific justification for this
expedition. That is why we say
the Japanese should call it off.’

Although the IWC passed a
five—year moratorium on all
commercial whaling in 1985,
Japan claims it is still allowed
to hunt whales to assess:
population levels and breeding
rates under Article 8 of the
IWC convention. Since the
IWC has ‘no authority to
approve or forbid ’ such
‘ scientific ’ whaling, and IWC
Commissioners ‘ are not scient-
ists,’ Junichiro Okamoto of
Japan’s Fisheries Agency said
Britian’s intervention was
‘ ridiculous.’ _

Greenpeace, however, says it
has signed affidavits from four

HOUSTON POST - January 4, 1988

Needlihg animals back tO health

Acupuncturist Dr. Larry Shaw takes his veterinary practice on the road

‘ . e' ,1 , ,:

By Raequel Roberts
OF THE HOUSTON POST

few eyebrows were raised

around Cut and Shoot last

year when word got out
that Ray and Sandy Oliverson,
owners of Mudde Creek Farms,
had hired Dr. Larry Shaw to treat
their thoroughbred, Jeffery’s lst,
with acupuncture.

Acupuncture is not commonly
practiced in Cut and Shoot, nor
many other Texas towns, for that
matter. What with all those needles
and stuff, it kind Of reminds most
ranchers of tofu and incense, min-
eral water and California. ,

“Our friends thought we were
practicing witchcraft or some-
thing," recalls Sandy Oliverson
with a chuckle.

But the improvement the Oliver-
sons noticed in Jeffery’s lst -—
whose arthritis was brought on by
too many laps around the track --

was so astounding that the Oliver- '

sons, and even some of their be-
grudging neighbors, have become
true believers in this centuries-old
remedy. “We wouldn’t be able to
ride her if it weren't for the treat-
ments,” says Sandy.

Shaw, 41, is one of only five vet-
erinarians in Texas who is board
certified by the international Veter-

inary Acupuncture Society (WAS) _

-— an 18-year-old non-profit orga-
nization that sets guidelines and
certifies veterinarians in acupunc-
ture. He treats animals in Houston,
Conroe, Willis, Montgomery and,
of course, Cut and Shoot.

in addition, Shaw -- who oper-
ates a mobile practice -- is the vet-
erinarian for Houston Police De-
partment's Mounted Patrol.

“1 added acupuncture to my
practice about six years ago after 1

ad problems with my own back,"

says Shaw. “I responded so well to
acupuncture treatments, i ﬁgured
my patients would, too."

As with humans, acupuncture
can be used to treat all sorts of mal-
adies in animals, including arthritis,
hip dysplasia (like that often found
in golden retrievers), back prob—
lems and other muscular and skele-
tal conditions.

Acupuncture was, of course, not
part of the curriculum at Oklahoma
State’s College of Veterinarian
Medicine when Shaw got his doc-
torate in 1970. To learn the ancient
Oriental methods, he went through
a training program at North Caroli-
na State Veterinary School, spon-
sored by the lVAS.

Getting certified, says Shaw, was
no small feat. In addition to flying
to North Carolina for the four, four-
day classes, there were also tough
academic standards to meet. “The
course included 120 hours of train-
ing, and then there was a written
and practical test. Almost one-third
of my class didn’t pass the first
time,” notes Shaw, who says more
and more vets are realizing the le-

”How bad is it, Doc?” You
Would think by looking at
him that the horse had
something to be worried
about. Not the case. Dr.
Larry Shaw, who operates
a mobile veterinary serv-
ice and is board certified
to practice acupuncture
and herbology, is simply
checking the X-rays of this
member of the Houston
Police Department's
Mounted Patrol. At left.

py to treat Jeffery's 1st's

gitimacy of acupuncture.

There’s nothing voodoo-like about acu-
puncture, insists Shaw, who performs
acupuncture on all types of animals, but
primarily horses. He doesn’t blabber in-
cantations while treating a lame horse. In-
stead, he follows a specific set of proce-
dures‘, whose results, Shaw says, have
been scientifically verified.

To find the horse’s source of pain, Shaw
first applies pressure to various points on
her body. ”There’s a total of 670 acu-
puncture points both on animals and hu-
mans,” he explains. Then, he inserts nee-
dles at those points where the horse is
sensitive. They normally remain in place
for about 10 minutes. The horse, who’s
awake throughout the procedure, feels
very little pain.

Along with his set of needles, Shaw also
uses a laser machine. With something that
looks very much like a pocket flashlight,
he directs the laser to acupuncture points
on the animal. The laser stimulates the
production of endorphins — the same
hormone that gives humans their “sec—
ond—wind” when exercising — which
kills pains and increases healing.

Shaw’s assistant, Cindy Kay Hopper, an
animal technician, records the treatments
given to each animal. She also helps give
injections and calms down pets and their
owners.

For an acupuncture treatment, Shaw
charges $50, plus a house call of $25 or
less depending on how far he has to trav-
el. Normally four to six treatments are
needed.

Shaw is also qualified to practice herbo-
logy and often dispenses herbs as a fol-
low-up to acupuncture. “Like you would
an antibotic,” says Shaw. When he en-
counters a urinary tract problem, for ex-
ample. Shaw might prescribe polyporous,
a substance made from fungus that grows

on the roots of pine trees in northern Chi-
na.

Shaw’s acupuncture technique, which
accounts for about 20 percent of his busi-
~ ness, is not the only thing that sets him
apart from most animal doctors. He is also
one of few veterinarians with an office to-
tally on wheels.

“I started a mobile practice about 10
years ago because I seemed to be doing
most of my work out of the clinic,” says
Shaw, “My entire practice now is house
calls.”

A

Shaw operates his business, Mobile Vet
Clinic, out of a specially designed ambu-
lance, which even the most inveterate
customized van drivers would find im-
pressive. In addition to its fancy running
boards and club chair seats, the van is out—
fitted with a bevy of equipment including
a centrifuge for testing blood, an X—ray
machine, a microscope, and a refrigerator
for storing vials of vaccines. In this van,
Shaw can even do minor surgery; while
he can’t spay a mastiff, he can suture
wounds and set broken legs. Major sur-
gery is done at a veterinary hospital.

With so much territory to cover, it
should come as no surprise that Shaw has
gone through two such vans in a decade
and 15 now on his third.

Mobile vets, Shaw explains, are at their
best when treating a large group of ani-
mals, preferably three or more at a time.
It’s not that he won’t treat a single Sia-
mese, it’s just cheaper to work on several
pets at once.

To this end, Shaw often conducts
neighborhood clinics. “We’ll pick a loca-
tion and send out flyers to let people
know the time and place of the clinic,” he
explains. “Then we offer reduced rates to
anyone who brings a pet in for treat—
ment.”

He charges between $12.50..ar1d $25
for a house call, plus extra for necessary

medications and treatments. Shaw (who
works 50 hours per week) says some of
hisbuSIest days are on weekends, during
whichtime the most interesting calls
come in.

“I got an emergency call one Saturday
afternoon,” Shaw recalls, “and on the
other end of the line was a women who
kept saying something about a bird being ’
attacked by dogs. I was having trouble
hearing her because I was on my car
phone and the calls kept cutting out. Any-
way, .l suggested she take the bird to a vet
hospital for treatment and then she came
back onthe line and she said she didn’t
think this bird would fit in her truck. 1 fig-
ured we couldn’t be talking about a bird.”

With his curiosity peaked, Shaw headed
out to the call. “It turns out that this was
at an exotic game ranch and the bird the
lady was talking about was a Rhea bird
that’s about as big as an ostrich.” The big
bird, he adds, “had more moves than
Walter Payton” and it took some doing to
catch him.

One of Shaw’s best customers is the
HPD’s Mounted Patrol. Since the unit was
founded back in 1985, Shaw has been the
veterinarian who treats routine stable af-
flictions like colic and worms. He’s also
dealt with problems unique to these four-
footed beat cops. “Because the'horses are
on concrete all day, we see a lot of cases
of shin splints,” Shaw explains. “The heat
in the summer can also be a problem.”

The convenience of having a vet on
wheels should be obvious to anyone
who’s ever tried to coax an 80—pound lab-
rador into a car, or has had to drive across

, town with a cat clinging to the sun visor.

Getting people to accept acupuncture,
on the other hand, is still a bit more diffi-
cult. But, says Shaw, he receives more re-
ferrals by the day.

They’re even coming in from Cut and
Shoot.

A sad visitor yesterday was

“This is the fourth time I’ve
been here to look for Honey.
We have told the police, but I -

The number of dogs taken in
at Battersea rises every year,
and ﬁgures for lost or aban-
doned dogs has doubled in the
last 30 years. -

Highway

Millions of animals
killed each year _
on America’s roads

By MICHAEL D. DUNN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — A million animals a
day are killed on America’s high-
ways.

Close to 400 million a year. And
that’s just a conservative estimate,
federal officials say.

No one knows with certainty
how many animals are crippled or
killed by automobiles, but experts
say the problem worsens each year
as wildlife habitats are sliced open
for new highways.

“A million animals a day, and
that does not include those that are
maimed or crippled,” said Guy
Hodge, director of data and infor-
mation for the Humane Society of
the United States.

“we-have been looking into this
since the 19605. But it’s really been
in the 19805 that it has caught pub-
lic attention because of the greater
number of highways and the loss of
wildlife habitat due to develop-
ment,” he said. “We expect it will
continue to get worse as more ani-
mals become concentrated near
highways.”

Hodge said the Humane Society
arrived at its million-a-day figure by
analyzing bibliographies of field
studies done on wildlife/highway
relationships. The actual figure is
probably higher, but there’sno way
to know for sure, he said. ‘

Experts believe, however, that

of those one million animals killed

. daily, about 600,000 are birds.

TAMPA TRIBUNE

 

“Birds need grit to digest their
food, and the pebbles next to the
road are good for that," Hodge said.
“And they’ll eat insects that have
been. hit, by cars. Unfortunately,
roads hold an attraction for wildlife,

. which leads to their high mortality

rate.”

Scavengers such as raccoon,
opossum and vulture also are drawn
to highways to feed on litter thrown

from cars, or on animals that have .

been run over, he said. And the

woodsy buffer areas separating;
multi-lane roads tend to draw ant--

mals such as deer, he said.

“They don’at recognize the haz-m-

ard until it’s foo late,” he said.

January 10 , 1987

“Fencing has been the most com-
monly tried way, especially with
deer, but the deer would jump the
fence to get at the grasses. And then
they’d get stuck because they
couldn’t get a sure footing on the
road to jump back over.”

In fact, deer are among the most
commonly killed animals on the na-
tion’s highways, Hodge said. In New
York state, some 30,000 deer are
killed each year by automobiles, ac-

cording to game officials. And Mich-_
igan officials reported more than:
' 25, 000 highway-related deer deaths

in 1984.
Rabbits, Altar: n8. squirrels,
opossums‘ an *kuri ...also top the

 

faces death or severe injury. No fig-

,ure is available for the total number
‘of animals killed each year state-

swide. But wildlife experts do know
how certain species are faring.

The Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission reports 22
bears killed so far this year on the
";states roads. Game officials said
that number is probably low, repre-

‘ senting only those incidents report-

.ed.
Since December 1979, according

G

‘ to the game commission, l4 endan-

list of mammals frequently killed
by automobiles, not" counting dogs
and cats.

Animals on roads create safety
problems for people, too. The Fed-
eral Highway Administration esti-
mates about 120 people are killed
and another 8,000 injured each year
in animal-related vehicle accidents.

Two months ago, a Hardee
County man was killed when a wild
owl ﬂew into his pickup truck and
struck him on the head, causing

'him to veer into oncoming traffic.
Floridians also have been killed or

Zoo admission fee back on council agenda

By Andrew Benson
OF THE HOUSTON POST C

A

For the third year in a row, city
officials plan to propose a contro-
versial admission charge to the
Houston Zoo as a way to supple-
ment sagging general fund reve-
nues allocated to 200 operations.

City Parks and Recreation Direc-
tor Don Olson said Monday he
plans to ask the Houston City
Council as early as February to ap-
prove a zoo'admission charge of up
to $2.50 for adults as a way to raise
more than $1.4 million annually for
200 operations.

Even if the fee is approved, the
city does not expect it to go into

effect until December 1988 or Jan-

uary 1989.

it was only two years ago that ;
Mayor Kathy Whitmire first pro- *

posed a zoo admission charge of up
to $3 for adults. She later withdrew
it in the face of strong council op-
position. A fee of up to $2.50 for
adults was again proposed by Whit-
mire in 1987 but was defeated by
the council.

Nevertheless, Olson said he
plans to bring the fee up for a vote
again because he fears more cuts in
1989 in the lean zoo budget will

hurt the quality of the fourth—busi-
est zoo in the nation.

“When the budget was doing
well, there was no reason to worry
about it,” said Olson. “But we have
a combination of budget cuts in
Houston that have taken their toll
and an expanding capital improve-
ments program that requires more
staff. They will come together right
about now.”

The Houston Zoo is one of the
few remaining major zoos without
an admission fee to help offset
costs, Olson said. Instead, the zoo
is supported by tax dollars from the
general fund. \ ‘

In the 1988 budget, the zoo re-
ceived less than $2.5 million, a cut
of about $800,000 from the previ-
ous budget year. With the opening
of new displays in 1988, Olson ex—
pects he will need more operating
money. '

“We’re short on staff and short
. on 0 rating budget," he said.
' ”I we don’t get this fee, we will
be asking for additional funding,
I’m sure. Whether we would get
more money in the budget is ques-
‘* tionable.” .

all. They do steal scenes, they‘are good only for cheap laughs and
cheaper sentiment, and they get paid the kind of residuals Mikhail
Baryshnikov and Bill Moyers will never see. <

Put a boy and his dog on screen, and Laurence Olivier is reduced to a
supporting actor. Which is why the Marx Brothers never worked with either
dogs or children in their movies. '

Which is why the worst Disney movies ever made -—- a whole slew of turkeys
starting in 1949 with “The Shaggy Dog” and grand out like through
“Greyfriars Bobby” (1961), “Big Red” (1962), “Savage Sam” (1963), "The Ugly
Dachshund” (1966) and others of that period —— were contrived formula ﬁlms
based on the assumption that audienm have limitless affection for dogs that
sleep on their masters’ gravesites, face down mountain lions, swim rapids and
drive ModeLT Fords.

And now, after a time when there were few canines left on TV, they seem to
be everywhere underfoot, usually in an attempt to (a) humanize outrageously
violent cops like Mel Gibson in the movie “Lethal Weapon,” (b) give an edge to
a sensitivecop like John Ritter in TV’s “Hooper-man,” or (c) sell beer, like
Spuds MacKenzie, who is currently in a lot of hot water over his party animal
persona .

beersfrom the fridge. Yet none of these dogs does very much at all. They don’t
jump from burning buildings like Lassie or attack Apache warriors like Rin Tin
Tin. They’re not asked to do anything but sit around on the set and pant. Dress
him up in Hawaiian shirts, have girls in bikinis fondle him, and even a benign
canine can be a pitchman. Ask a mangy mutt named Mike the Dog to do nothing
more than eat dogfood out of can, put an actor like Nick Nolte down next to him
on all fours, and you have social commentary in a movie such as “Down and Out
in Beverly Hills” (which became a short-lived TV series that Mike obviously
couldn’t can-y).

It makes you wonder what’s happened to those great dogs of the past who
had to risk their tails to turn in performances that would tear your heart out and

, make you want to go out and buy a puppy for your kids. I’m talking about dogs

that swam rivers, pulled sleds, gnawed through ropes and warned their masters
not to cross bridges with rusted underpinnings. I’m talking about dogs like
Argos in “The Odyssey,” who, covered with lice and lying on a dung heap, is the
only creature who remembers his master aﬁer 20 years’ separation.

Of course, for centuries it was tough to mount a melodrama actually built
around the character of a dog. Shakespeare pretty much leﬁ them out of his
plays, the exception being a walk-on part for a dog named Crab, chastised by his
master Launce for not shedding tears over some human misfortune in “Two

7 Gentlemen of Verona” Indeed, in the 18th Century, Dr. Samuel Johnson once

insulted both women preachers and performing dogs by comparing their efforts
with the backhanded compliment, “It is not done ml]; but you are surprised to
ﬁnd it done at all.”

Great artists paint horses; minor artists paint dogs. Dogs have little majesty
because, once domesticated, they become sycophants and therefore good only
as the butt of jokes, not as jokesters. It is their irrational ﬁdelity, their eager-
ness to take a blow and come back for more that endears them to all, which is
why Jack London was able to write the best boy’s book ever, “The Call of the
Wild.” Mark Twain said, “When a man’s dog turns against him, it is time for his

j 'wife to pack her trunk and go home to mamma” One wonders what dogs would

make of man’s characterizations of them if Nature had given them the ability to
read. “A dog’s best friend is his illiteracy,” wrote Ogden Nash.

It was really the advent of the movies that gave the world its ﬁrst canine
heroes, whether it was the hilarious pit bull named Pete in the “Our Gang”
comedies or Rin Tin Tin himself. Pete was a superb actor, helped out by the
occasional trick of animation that enabled him to roll his eyes. He was so good
because he acted like a real slum kid’s hound, scrappy, suspicious and ready to
tear the pants off any adult who got near Wheezer. Heroic dogs were under

I

disgrace the memory of this remarkable ca-
nine by switching to another dog, instead de-
buted Bin Tin Tin Jr. in “The Big Pay—Off” in
1933. Two decades later a new, somewhat. less
menacing dog was used for the long-running
series “The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin” (1958—
1964), in which the dog is attached to the
U. S. Cavalry of the 18808 as an Indian and
hombre ﬁghter.

But no dog, before or since, ever equaled Rin
Tin 'I‘in’s popularity, longevity or feats of dar-
ing. He was, truly, the Douglas Fairbanks
(both Senior and Junior) of dog heroes.

The 1930s was a good time for cinematic bow
wows, especially in screwball comedies such as
“Bringing Up Baby” ( 1938). In that one, a terri-
er named Asta, an MGM contract hound who
had already made a great impression on the
public as Nick and Nora Charles’ gadlly mascot
in “The Thin Man” series, played a dog as a dog
—— noisy, a nuisance, the spur to all the action in
the center of the plot.

The other great star of the era was, of
course, Lassie, seen ﬁrst in the ﬁlm “Lassie
Come Home” (1943). The movie was based on
the beloved Eric Knight novel and starred the
young, beautiful Elizabeth Taylor. Lassie, too,
had both youth and beauty, but the dog also
had a dark, sexual secret hidden from the pub-
lic at the time. The truth was, Lassie had been
born and christened Pal, and was in reality a
female impersonator. 0f the dog’s perfor—
mance, however, one critic has written, “Pal
[was] the only star who could play a bitch bet—
ter than Bette Davis.”

MGM knew such a cover-up couldn’t be kept
under maps, so the next movie in the series

was entitled “Son of Lassie” (1945), with Pal

coming out of the doghouse into the bright
Spotlight of public scrutiny. So convincing was
Pal in the role that the series was continued
through “Courage of Lassie” (1946) and “The
Painted Hills” (1951).

Other dogs went on to play Lassie in the TV
series that ran, under six formats, from 1954 to
1972, followed by an animated series in 1975
called “Lassie’s Rescue Rangers.” The original

and somehow met the demanding schedules of
prime-time network TV. But the collie charac-
ter was more cuddly than noble, and much of
the time the dog was made to act as if it were
limping from chronic, malevolent injuries that
nevertheless never prevented Lassie from

completing her heroic duties week after week. ..

The poor thing’s foot was always up in the air,

either waving goodbye or pretending to be -

banged up. It was like seeing Uncle Miltie in
drag once too often.

The 1950s were the big time for canines in
Hollywood. Not only were there Rin Tin Tin
and Lassie, but there were more comic dogs,
including a new Asta from “The Thin Man” TV
series and a boozy St. Bernard from “Topper”
named Neil.

“The best thing about animals,” wrote
Thornton Wilder in 1942, “is that they don’t
talk much.” Hollywood shattered this vir-

tue time after time, especially with
the “Francis the Talking Mule” se-
ries, and TV did with the ridiculous
“Mr. Ed.” Yet one of the funniest
characters to enliven the tube was a
lazy, almost motionless bassett
hound named Cleo on “The People’s
Choice,” starring Jackie Cooper.

The weekly proceedings of this ‘sit—
com were commented on, like a
Greek chorus or Thornton Wilder’s
own narrator in “Our Town,” by Cleo
in a voice—over by actress Mary Jane
Croft. It was as effective as George
Burns’ commentary on “The Burns
and Allen Show” and was a break-
through in anthropomorphism dur-
ing the so-called Golden Age of Tele-

vision.

 

Of course, there was never a lack of
dog puppets and dog suits on televi-
sion, from Farfel, who sang the Nestle
commercials, to Barkley on “Sesame

' Street.” And the Disney studios did

produce two excellent animated dog
sagas -— “Lady and the Tramp” (1955)
and “101 Dalmatians” (1961). But live
dog acts declined, especially after the
demise of the “Ed Sullivan Show” in
1971. The ’60s .were not kind to ani-
mals, and the ’70s had no canine stars
of any note, except the sickeningly

sentimental Benji, a runty, salivating
little terrier who is to movies what

saccharine is to good taste. In a series
of godawful movies —- badly made, .
poorly written, wretchedly ﬁlmed — '

this pint-size Rin Tin Tin appealed
only to small children and had a way
of boring their parents to sleep after
the ﬁrst reel. Better 10 tickets to Dis-

.» ney’s “The Shaggy Dog” than one
ticket to “Benji.”

But dogs ,have obviously made a

comeback in prime time and in com-

mercials, especially this year in series
such as “Hooperman,” in which John
Ritter plays a nice-guy cop who knows
exactly how long to cook angel-hair
spaghetti, stays faithful to a woman

show was called, insipidly, “Jeff’s Collie,” the
next, “Timmy and Lassie.” The trouble with
these formats, as with the treatment of most
animal shows on TV, was that it was mostly
bound by an indoor set that allowed for too
many lackluster snifﬁngs-out of lost children or
kittens and‘not enough real, outdoor action to
show what Lassie could really do. The dogs
used on the show were well trained, however,

who won’t commit to him, and has an
anorexic little rat of a dog named Bi-
§oux whose sole function is to inter-
‘rupt conversations and wet the floor
for a cheap laugh. In a recent inter-
view, Ritter said, “That dog really bit
me in the pilot. You know how actors
always say, ‘I love Deborah’ and so '
on? I hate this dog! But it does good
work. It won’t rehearse. It saves its
best work for the close-ups. The dog 1
eats pastrami, and it gives him terrible ‘
s.”
ga‘There is something troubling in

these remarks of a co-star, and in lis-
tening closely to one episode of a re-
cent “Hooperman” I think I
discovered why: In an early scene,
Hooperman tells his girlfriend, “H is
lead is in the kitchen and he does need
to go for a walk.” Then, later on in the
show, he picks up the dog, looks it in
the eye, and says, “Bijoux, you’re a
girl, what do you think? I’d appreciate
your input.”

What goes on here? Is this still an-
other cover-up like the Lassie gambit?
Is Ritter — and his producers — try-
ing to hide something here? Should
viewers take a closer look at Bijoux
from now on?

The point is, most of the dogs cur-
rently on TV have about as much per-
sonality as they have sex. On “Duet,” a
show about Yuppies concerned with
nothing except who’s in bed with
whom, a character named Ben is a
writer with no more imagination than
to call his mutt Reuben, or sometimes
Ben. Even the producer of the show

7 has named his company -— Ubu Pro—
ductions —— after his dog, complete
with voice-over at the closing credits,
“Sit, Ubu! Sit! Good dog.” This is not
the work of ﬁrst-class comedy writers;
maybe their names happen all to be

, Ben, too.

Things aren’t any better on “Mar-

5 ried . . . With Children,” where the 1

dog merely goes up and down the

i stairs and exists to antagonize the har-
ried, middle-class Chicago husband
with its presence. But are these dogs
called upon to do anything? Be funny?
Put a paw over their eyes and moan or
growl? Run out howling in fast motion?
No, they are just there as objects to
throw a line to. Don Johnson’s alligator
en “Miami Vice” is a better actor than
these dogs. »

The only human being on teleVISiuga
who puts dogs in their proper place is
David Letterman, whose continuing se—
ries of “Stupid Pet Tricks” demon-
strates the truth of Dr. Johnson’s
comment on dogs that get up on their
l‘iind legs to do anything but make more

02‘s. -

Which leads me to Spuds MacKenzie,
who I am still not sure is not just a
stuffed animal. Here’s this English bull

' terrier (I’ve been told he is not a pit bull

terrier) dressed up like a Ken doll with
his tongue out. Fawned over by nubile
young girls, shaken about like a scare-
crow, and asked to do nothing but stare
at the camera, Spuds is a phenomenon
of the beer business. Bud Light prob-
ably wishes it had put him on another
account, since their “Gimme a Light”
campaign runs concurrently with the
MacKenzie spots. But who could have

- guessed that this pea-eyed mutt with-

out so much as a woof of a line would

-. become the next Clara Peller, the ca-

nine equivalent of Joe Isuzu?

Whether this “original party animal”

really appeals to six-pack—a—day, would-
be jocks or to nubile young women is

hard to ﬁgure. You’ll notice his ﬁrst

name is not “Studs” or “Suds,” but he

clearly has an appeal to young viewers,

’ and there has been a great deal of con-

troversy about the selling of Spuds
MacKenzie posters and stuffed dolls
clearly designed for the kiddie market.
What else would cause such a stir but a
rumor that spread like wildﬁre about
the death of the dog in, alternately, a

LONDON (England) DAILY TELEGRAPH - January 2, 1988

iant earwig and
blue butterﬂy
join thedodo

By Charles Clover, Environment Correspondent

THE GIANT St Helena 'earwig, three inches long,
joined the giant pied billed grebe, the Palos Verdes

blue butterﬂy and between 1,000 and 10,000 other . V

species, mainly insects, in disappearing off the face

of the earth this year.

Man was, as ever, the
main culprit, according to
the World Wildlife Fund.
The last giant pied-billed
grebe became extinct after
someone lowered the water
level of its home, Lake
Atitlan in Guatemala, and
artificially-introduced fish
ate its food.

The Peruvian Lake Titicaca
ﬂightless grebe is a few months

away from the same fate, says
- the Fund.

Deforestation blamed

The Palos Verdes blue was
snuffed out forever when the
Californian city after which it is
named decided to build a base-

extinction iceberg,” says the
report.

The reason We do not know

for certain how many species
have become extinct is that
thousands now living, particu-
larly insects native to the can-
opy of tropical rainforests, are
still unknown. -

ONE-STOP PET snors

.rhe sun is shining on Castro Valley this
Sunday afternoon, but judging by the furry
patrons in the Payless parking lot, it has just
rained cats and dogs. At least 50 pets have
gathered here with their owners, and more
keep coming, dividing as they arrive into two
neat lines: canines on one side and, several
safe yards away, felines on the other.

If the dogs wag their tails happily, oblivi-
ously, the cats cowering in boxes seem to know
what awaits them: the prick of a veterinarian’s
syringe. They’re about to receive a low-cost
vaccination from Pet Prevent-A-Care, Inc., a
traveling animal health care clinic.

The ﬁrst PPC van tugging a trailer-housed

 

costs by a half or more. Its vaccinations range
from a low of $3.50 for simple rabies to a high
of $15 for the rabies, “six in one” and Corona
virus combination.

“It’s great!” exclaims Margaret Counihan,
at the other end of a leash attached to Trina
the dachshund. “At one time we had three
dogs, so we brought them all. It certainly is a
boon to retired people like us who are on
limited incomes.”

A study conducted by the veterinary unit
of the California health department found
that half of all dogs in the state are not
receiving their legally required rabies vaccina-
tions. For some pet owners, PPC’s low prices
mean the difference between getting their
animals vaccinated and having them go with-

out, which makes the parking-lot clinic popu-

lar with the department’s public health veteri-

 

clinic hit California
roads in 1976. The mo- it
bile unit in Castro Val-
ley is one of seven, each
visiting two locations a
day every weekend.
PPC veterinarians car-
avan from home base in
Santa Rosa through all
three Pacific Coast
states and much of Ne-
vada and Arizona, vac-
cinating pets against
everything from dis-
temper to feline leuke-
mia. Well over a million
dogs and cats have been
needled at one of PPC’s
mobile clinics.

impulse-type item,” ex-
plains company president Randy Morrison.
“If the timing is right and the price is right
and it’s convenient, they’ll do it.” Since most
private veterinarians’ fees include a charge for
ofﬁce visits, vaccinations can run as high as
$37. By eliminating that fee and buying
vaccines in bulk, PPC can afford to lower

 

narian, Dr. Denny Constantine. “As long as
we get dogs vaccinated, we aren’t particular
about how it’s done,” he says. “As long as it’s
done by a veterinarian or technician under the
direction of a veterinarian.”

health department. Many veterinarians, wor-
ried about cut-rate competition, ﬁled com-
plaints that PPC practices don’t conform to
proper procedures. The state board that po-
lices animal health providers investigated and
found none of the allegations to be true.

Some. went further in an effort to break
PPC, Morrison alleges. Local vets would set
up one-day free clinics next to PPC’S road-
show until the company sued and won a
permanent injunction against the practice.
“The mobile clinic concept did catch the
veterinary community by surprise,” explains
Gary Hill, executive ofﬁcer to the Board of
Examiners in Veterinary Medicine, who lik-
ens its welcome to the one restaurant owners
probably gave the ﬁrst hot dog stand.

PPC veterinarian Steve Sweetser says pri-
vate doctors should not be concerned about
losing business because PPC’s services are
limited to vaccinations and testing. And since
PPC staff are on the lookout for sick animals,
he points out, they make many referrals to
local vets. '

As the line of animal patients and patient
humans in the Payless parking lot begins to
thin, a tiny gray schnauzer on one table
squirms to avoid the needle.

“Go talk to him,” a technician tells the
dog’s owner, “because he’s not going to be real
happy about this if he’s never had one before.”

Another man, hugging his dog tightly to
keep it from wiggling, jokes to the vet: “Now
don’t get me instead.”

“Funny you should say that,” she retorts.
“I haven’t done that for the last four or ﬁve
times.”

Surveying the scene, Sweetser says he has .
grown to appreciate the welcome he gets each
time PPC sets up shop. “I’ve been a vet since
I975,” he says, “and I’ve found more appreci-
ation for the work we do than when l was in a
regular veterinary practice. More people
thank me for this.”

Tale Of Cats
; For All Ages

I Al Montesi, revered professor
of English at St. Louis Univer-
sity, poet, author and hon-
ored guru to assorted colo-
nies of writers, illustrators
and cartoonists throughout
the country.

 

 

I Montesi, author of five books

- of poems and one critical
study, has written “Peter
Bently the Super Sleuth Cat”
(Cornerstone Press), a detec-
tive story. The book is illus-
trated by Michael Sinner,
with a cover design by Robert
Bangert.

 

I The book is about Peter Bent-
ly, a house pet of Tommy 0n-
ions and a clever detective cat
admired throughout Purrville.
The cats in the book are pat-
terned after Montesi’s six
cats.

I “My own cats, and my ex-
traordinary experiences with
them, led me to write this
book. It is dedicated to peo-
ple. from ages 8 to 80. The
story appeals to adults as
well as children.”

 

Q What is “Peter Bently the Su-
per Sleuth Cat"about?

A It is about a superior detective
cat called Peter Bently, the house
.pet of little Tommy Onions. In
Purrville, a cat town, Bently is a
very important personage, a very
wise crime detector. The children
of Lafayette Square, my home, are
in the book. And the Tongs, who
did exist in Old Chinatown in San
Francisco, are in it. It is a tale of
both cities.

Q How did you come to write the
book?

AI have written ﬁve books of po—
ems and one critical study, but I
have always wanted to write fic-
tion. My own cats, and my extraor-
dinary experiences with them, led
me to write this book. I have four
inside cats and two outside cats.
The cats in the story reflect the
stellar amenities of my cats. For
instance, Peter Bently is patterned
after Carmel. He does rake in poker
chips, and do the other funny

African elephant may become
extinct unless steps taken

I A French Press Agency Report

PARIS -— Ivory traders will hunt the Afri-
can elephant into extinction within five years
unless governments crack down hard and
fast, according to a French zoologist.

More than 100,000 elephants are slaugh-
tered each year, and hunters are training
their rifles on younger and younger targets,
said Pierre Pfeffer, research worker with the
National Center for Scientific Research in
Paris.

“At this rate, there will be no elephants in
the wild within four to five years,” he told the
French Press Agency.

Only the middlemen made much money
out of the ivory trade, he said, while African
countries saw precious little of the profits.

Pfeffer said two measures are essential to
the elephant’s survival: its registration as an
endangered species on a list compiled in
Washington, which would effectively outlaw
the international ivory trade; and a ban on
importing or handling virgin or sculpted ivory
in the European Economic Community.

The Indian variety of elephant, which
numbers 30,000 in India, Sri Lanka, Thailand,

L Burma and" Sumatra, is less at risk because its

tusks are smaller, he said.

But the African elephant population has
dropped from 2.5 million at the end of World
War II to less than 500,000 today.

Soaring ivory prices have provoked the
carnage, with tusks now fetching about $54
per pound, more than 200 times their worth
at the start of the 19705.

Around 90,000 elephants are slaughtered
each year to meet demand from the Far East
-— a total of 1.6 million since 1971, Pfeffer
said.

Elephants have been all but wiped out in
West Africa, with a few dozen surviving in
Senegal and around 1,000 in Ivory Coast.

The giant beasts are under threat in Zaire,
Cameroon and Gabon and have completely
disappeared from the Central African Repub-
lic, in the face of wholesale slaughter that. the
government has been unable to stem.

'A lesson . ' ‘31
In life’s Goodness .

5‘:
H18 YEAR, Jonathan Will, age 15, is getting.
; , the greatest gift that can be given: a friend}.
The fact that this friend, a large dog, does not?
, need to be wrapped is but one of its merits.

Her merits. Angel is a blond Labrador. About.
her, as about all members of that dignified spe-
cies, there clings, like banker’s worsted, the aurai
of knowing what is best but being too well-bred
to insist on it. So she will improve the tone of the
household, as she has done of Christmas. =

“We shall soon be having Christmas at our
throats,” says a P.G. Wodehouse character who

should be ashamed of himself. The routs and
revels that erupt in connection with Christmas

do take their toll on body and soul.

Furthermore, Christmas Eve invariably is a
“walpurgisnacht”~ of trips to drugstores for bat-r

teries that were not included in the box contain
ing 42,389 of the 42,390 parts in the do—it-yourself

mainframe computer. On the box are printed-
those three terrible words: “Some Assembly Reg’

. quired.”

, ' OGS coME assembled and need no batteries. ‘
r A philosophic dog like a Labrador will, .if.

given half a chance, give to us the closest we are
apt to come to unconditional love. Pedants may
take issue with the ascription of love to an ani-
mal. But however we

categorize what dogs do

for us, it is what it is,

and it comes down to

this: Our dogs are al-

ways glad to see us.

These days Jona-

. than is a boy of the

great indoors, having

«discovered Bon Jovi ‘(a

rock group) and the

teenage pleasure of sov-

ereignty in one’s own

room. Angel ,. presum- .
ably will put up with a ’
lot'of Bon Jovi. But she also will insist on brisk
walks, which will do them both some good.

Jonathan is handicapped (Down’s syndrome)
and sometimes has trouble making his abundant
thoughts and feelings understood by strangers.
.. So at times, with poignant urgency, he has turned
for companionship to a neighbor’s dog, another
blond Lab, named Skylab. _

There is a large lesson here about the handi
capped. Jon is just like everyone else, only a bit
more so, in the following sense. 1»

A shadow of loneliness is inseparable from
the fact of individual existence. This shadow is
perhaps somewhat darker for people like Jon

suited to this Season. It is that some small mitiga-

; tion of the harshness of life’s lottery, some gently
‘: compensating thumb on the scale of justice, has
' given Jon an enlarged talent for friendship, with

people and with their best friends. _

LONDON (England) DAILY TELEGRAPH - Jan. 2, 1988

. Rate-capped Ealing to

employ animals ofﬁcer

By John Grigsby, Local Government Correspondent
A NEW POST of animal rights ofﬁcer, believed to be

the ﬁrst of its kind in the country, has been created

by Ealing Borough Council, which faces an enforced
:44 per cent cut in its rates this spring under the
i Government’s rate-capping measures.

The holder of the £13,000-
a-year Job will ensure that

fpet shops comply with the
law and investigate com-

plaints about the treatment

. of animals.

Mr Martin Mallam, leader of

the Conservative opposition,
said yesterday that the ﬁnal

cost to ratepayers, when

iexpenses were taken into
account, would be about £20,000
ayear.

Kremlin nickname
He demanded that this and

the other 1,400 posts created by
f the Labour administration since
; it took control 18 months ago
' should bear the burden of cuts
before services were affected.
: The council also has 100 equal
-' opportunities staff, a £783,000
- race equality unit and a
i £500,000 women’s unit, he said.

Mr Mallam said: “The cuts
must come from the army of
extra bureaucrats which Labour

 

has installed in what is lovingly
known as “the Kremlin” by its
inhabitants.”

The recently-recruited staff,
he said, were not impartial, .
non-political advisers, but
highly political animals. Often,
they were councillors fromr
neighbouring authorities.

_He complained that the coun-
c11 had been forced to give man-
ual workers two days’ holiday
over Christmas and the New
Year because it had previously
agreed to give its white collar
staff two days off.

'Absolutely filthy’

“The result is that no rubbish
has been collected over the holi-
day and Ealing town centre is
absolutely ﬁlthy,” he said.

Mr'Mallam said that the
counc1l could eventually face
bankruptcy on the model of
Liverpool. ,

“Obviously they will continue
to spend freely and at some
stage, no doubt, the Govern-
ment will have to come in and
do a_ Liverpool on us." Council

Kenai National Wildlife Refuge

Dear Mr. Doshier:

According to my dictionary, Refuge means "a shelter or pro-
tection from danger or distress; an asylum.”

It would seem to me that nothing in the world could or does
cause greater distress to our wild animals than trapping,
unless it be the stalking oihthe mighty macho man who gets
his delights out of killing our animals.

As far as I am concerned, a Refuge is just that — a place
“where our Wildlife can be safe from_all humans ~ no trapping,
no shooting, no harrassment of any sort.

There are enough places in the U.S. where trapping goes on
and hunting goes on. We have more and more farms and ranches
being devoted to raising animals and birds for the hunter,
and no doubt, the trapper.

For once — let our government carry out the true meaning of
the word ”REFUGE” - and let the animals alone.

Please see that this letter is included in comments on the
Environmental Assessment for the Kenai National Wildlife

Refuge.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

MILWAUKEE JOURNAL - October“ 9, 198.7

, ZoO’s oldest resident dies

Connie the condor came here
while a youngster in 1922

By ALICIA ARMSTRONG

of The Journal staff
Connie, the Andean condor that was the oldest
resident of the Milwaukee County Zoo and perhaps the
oldest creature at any zoo in the world, is dead.
He was about 66 years years old and had been a
Milwaukee resident since 1922, when the Zoo was in

Washington Park.
The lively vulture, who for years had lived a colorful

and sometimes even tempestuous life, died Wednesday.
A post mortem was planned, but‘Edward N. Diebold,
the Zoo’s curator of birds, said Friday morning that he
already was 99% certain that Connie had died of liver
failure related to age.

Diebold said that Andean condors. which are native
to South America and now are an endangered species,
are very long-lived. However, he added that he did not
know of any that had lived longer than Connie.

George F. Staal, Milwaukee’s city engineer in the
early 19205, returned from Argentina in 1922 with two
young condors. It was estimated at the time that they

were no more than a year old.

Staal, who was known to have a deep and abiding
affection for Milwaukee, apparently could not think of
a gift to the city that would be finer and more fitting
than a pair of strapping young vultures.

As someone has asked, what else of significance could
one present to the city that had everything? _

Pandas will visit zoo, but gorillas here to stay _‘

Zoo Atlanta will indeed have 'reason to celebrate in
its 99th anniversary year. Two giant pandas from the
People’s Republic of China will visit the zoo in Septem-
ber 1988, and Willie B., the celebrity gorilla, will cele-
brate his 27th year at the 200 with the opening of the
Gorillas of Cameroon exhibit. -

The pandas’ visit was arranged in August when for-
mer President Jimmy Carter visited China and per-
suaded Chinese ofﬁcials to promise that a pair of pan-
das would come to Atlanta.

Pandas are among the rarest and most charismatic
animals in the world and are noted for having a mes-
merizing effect. on people who come to view them. Dur-
ing their three-month Georgia visit, the two pandas —— a
male and a female -— will live in a zoo habitat built es-
pecially for them and will eat about 300 pounds of ar-
row bamboo a week. The bamboo, the animals’ favorite
food, will come from Chatham County near Savannah.

With the opening of the Cameroon exhibit, Willie
B.. 29, will at last have something besides a concrete
floor to sit on and a tire to play with.

The exhibit, the centerpiece of a $25 million rede-
velopment project at the 200, will have 13 members of
three gorilla families on a four-acre habitat. designed to
resemble a tropical rain forest. in West Central Africa.
Terry Maple, the zoo director, said the redevelopment
project will make Atlanta’s the “world‘s next great zoo.”

Alas, Willie B., one of the city’s most famous resi-
dents, will have to remain separated from the other go-
rillas because he has not been with other animals since
he was kidnapped in Africa as a baby.

area at the

Phoenix Zoo

Totally revamped, the children‘s area at
the Phoenix Zoo opened its doors to visi-
tors on October 1. Four years of research,
design, and fund-raising created the 200‘s
most ambitious and expensive project to
date; the new exhibit area covers 1 1 acres
and cost $1.8 million (all donated).

; Some popular exhibits—the red barn and

‘ petting 200, with agreeable sheep, goats,
and farm animals—remain, but a modern
educational focus has replaced dated car-
toon characters and fairy-tale themes.
Among others, monkeys, gibbons, deer,
toucans, raccoons, reptiles, prairie dogs.
and several tamarins (an endangered
monkey—like animal) make their homes in
16 new exhibits.

Each new exhibit teaches a lesson: the
raptor area shows how a predatory bird
hunts and what it eats; a jumping pit lets
children compare their own leaps to those
of a wallaby. On a series of bars, small
visitors can ﬁnd out how hard it is to
swing from branch to branch the way

gibbons do. q

In the northwestern corner of Ala-

The markers in Key Underwood
Memorial Coon Dog Graveyard re-
ﬂect the depth of the coon hunter’s
feelings for his hounds as well as
the rustic character of the sport of
coon hunting. One such marker is
made from an old cedar stump. An—
other is covered with pieces of a
fence post. Still another is fash—
ioned from the baking rack from an
old gas oven.

Several have dog collars or tags

‘ attached to them. One grave is

marked only by an iron stake with a
Ball jar attached to it with a cord.
Inside the jar is a set of Kennel

bits, no doubt by the grieving own-
er of the hound buried below.
Many of the stones honor
hounds that lived to ripe old ages.

.iéPollution Is Blamed for Killing Whales in St. Lawrence

a~ ' ,

 

Creatures are called
jfiiifthe ‘most polluted’
mammals on earth.

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

 

Special to The New York Times

ASHINGTON, Jan. 11 -—

Pollution from industrial

activity along the St.

‘ ~ Lawrence River and its

’“tributaries, including the Great

7 ; Lakes, is causing disease, premature

death and a declining birth rate

among the white beluga whales in the

river, according to Canadian re-
gsearchers. _

The St. Lawrence beluga popula-

‘tion, estimated at around 5,000 at the

2 beginning of this century and at about

411,200 after commercial whaling

ended in the 1950’s, is now believed to
" be about 450.
Concerned scientists point out that
the organisms upon which the whales
feed have also been found to be pollut-
,ed, and note that the area has Cana-
da’s highest level of birth defects, al-
though no direct cause-effect rela-
tionship has been shown.
Other marine mammals in the

'same stretch of the St. Lawrence, in-j
eluding harbor porpoises and seals,
had been found to have high levels of .

contaminants in their tissue. Scien-
tists say, however, that there is insuf-

ficient data to tell whether these ani-_

.mals are declining in number.
Autopsies of dead belugas washed
onto the banks of the river have found
very high levels of more than 30 haz-
ardous chemical pollutants, including
DDT, polychlorinated biphenyls or

NEW YORK TIMES - January 12, 1988

PCB’s, the pesticide Mirex, metals
such as mercury and cadmium, and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
similar to those found‘in cigarettes
and regarded as cancer-causing-
agents. . ‘ x
The diseases found in the 72 dead
whales examined so far include broné
chial pneumonia, hepatitis, perfo-'
rated gastric ulcers, pulmonary ab-é
scesses and even a case of bladder?
cancer. A majority' of the whales ap-:
pear to have died from septicemia, or
blood poisoning, which killed them beg‘
cause their immune systems failed.

Dr. Joseph E. Cummins, a profes-
sor of genetics at the University of
Western Ontario in London, Ont, said
that the immune system deficiency
was triggered by the toxic substances
ingested by the whales. When the
chemicals are metabolized in the
whales’ tissues, they attach them-
selves to the genetic material.

Dr. Cummins said he had reviewed
the available scientific literature on

g the contamination of animals by toxic
; substances and added, “I have come
‘to the conclusion that the St. Law-
rence beluga is the most polluted
g mammal on earth.” ‘
' The beluga, o‘r Delphinapterus
iieucas, is not the great white whale
ghunted by Captain Ahab. Largely a
idenizen of the Arctic, it is white, but
3 small as whales go, reaching a length
. of 20 feet. Its voice, a sweet, musical
i trill, caused Whalers of an earlier day
uto dub it the “sea canary.”
, There are an estimated 30,000 belu-
: gas in Arctic Canada as well as popu-
lations off the coasts of Alaska, Ice-
land and the Soviet Union. But the St.
Lawrence belugas are an isolated, dej
clining population that was given en-
dangered status by the Canadian

:fffojj 15 years. The whales were over-

;hunted starting in the beginning of
the century until commercial whaling
’ended in the 1950’s,. she said. Then, in
the 50’s and 60’s, hydroelectric plants

“built along tributaries of the St. Law-

,r‘ence caused changes in the salinity

. ‘of‘the river and in the numbers and

'kind of fish and other marine organ-

;isms upon which the beluga feed.

, ‘Mpst Devastating Blow’

But pollution is the “most devastat-
ning blow,” she said.

*‘ A spokesman for the Canadian De-

partment of Fisheries and Oceans
- said that there was insufficient data
ato say conclusively that toxic sub-
stances are~the chief cause of the de-

.. cline of the beluga. Yvan Vigneault,
who heads the fish habitat division in
the department’s Quebec office, said
pleasure boats and the hydropower
dams could also be factors.

’ But a number of scientists studying
the whales are convinced that the
_ toxic substances are the greatest

pressure on the remaining beluga

population in the St. Lawrence.

Dr. Pierre Béland, a biologist who
is science director of the St. Law-
rence National Institute of Ecotoxi-

- 'cology, a private research group, is
” one of the scientists who has inten—
’ sively studied the pathology of dead
,‘belugas beached along the St. Law-
frence. He said that many of the pollu-
' tants found in the whale tissues could
. be traced to their sources. For exam-
:ple, he said that there were large
quantities of the polycyclic aromatic
‘ chemical benzo-a-pyrene in
whales and that this chemical was
"emitted as a waste by Alcan Alu-
- minium Inc. plants along the Sague—
nay River. A company spokesman
7- said such a direct link had not been
conclusively proved.

Dr. Béland also noted that the au-
topsies found lesions of kinds never

- before encountered in marine mam-
" mals, as well tumors in numbers 10
times as great as normally found.

He reported that many belugas

“ were dying starting at. the age of 14 or
‘ 15, whereas a healthy whale can live

30 years. Even more ominous for the '

future of the St. Lawrence belugas is
his estimate that the ratio of young to
adult belugas has sunk below what is
required for the p0pulation to expand.

Report on Brain Tissues

Dr. Lee R. Shugart, an environmen-
tal scientist at the Oak Ridge Na~
Leboratory in Oak Ritige,
'l enn., an expert who was sent tissues

in

{it}; ; 3!

 

Some say link to
toxic substances is
‘ unproved.

 

for analysis, examined brain tissues

from the St. Lawrence belugas. His

tests showed unequivocally that the
tissue had taken up benzo-apyrene,
where it metabolized and became at-
tached “to the genetic material of the
organism.” He said he could conclude
from his tests that the whales were

exposed to concentrations of the sub»

stance “that would produce cancer in
other laboratory animals under simi—
lar conditions.”

Dr. Cummins, the geneticist, said'

the evidence showed that the chemi-
cal pollution had damaged the genetic
structure of the beluga’s reproduc-
tive cells.

“To all intents and purposes, the St..

Lawrence belugas are absolutely
doomed,” said Dr. Cummins, who has
worked with the environmental or-
ganization Greenpeace in Canada in
their effort to help the belugas. “I
can’t see how that population can re—
cover hearing the gene damage they
are bearing.”

But Dr. Beland andxothers say they.

believe that action to stop the flow of
pollutants into the St. Lawrence and
to clean up the river bed as well as ef—
forts to protect the whales from har-
assment might yet save the belugas.

Alcan Spokesman’s Views

Fernand A. Leclerc, media rela-
tions manager for Alcan Aluminium,
said that while plant emissions could
be a problem for the whales, “nothing
at this time allows us to say that what
comes out of our installations on the
Saguenay is a direct cause of the de-
cline of the beluga whale herd.” He
said that the company was joining

'with other groups to look into the fea-
sibility of an international scientific

symposium on the belugas later this
year.

Bruce McKay, director of the
Greenpeace office in Quebec and
head of its beluga whale program,

.said: “The belugas are a superb sym—

bol of the degradation of the St. Law-
rence and the Great Lakes. It is just a
matter of time until we see stronger
health effects among the people liv-
ing along the river. We are already

Lawrence.

Several species of great whales
that dwell most of the time in the
open ocean, including fin and blue
whales, come into the St. LaWrence
estuary to feed for part of the year.
These whales are apparently not sub—
stantially affected by the chemical
.pollution because their stay in the
Econtaminated waters is short and
{they do not feed on the bottom-dwell-
:ing fish that tend to accumulate large
amounts of the toxic substances in
their flesh.

There are comparatively few stud-
ies of the effects of pollution on ma-
rine mammals and little information
about how man-made pollution was
affecting other coastal whales.

' Dr. Cummins reported that there
have been reports of a relatively high
number of beached gray whales 0n
the Queen Charlotte Islands, off the
coast of Canada from the site of an-
other Alcan aluminum plant. ‘But
there has been no investigation of
those whale deaths, he said.

As for the belugas of the St. Law—
rence, Dr. Beland insisted that Cana-
dian government and industry must
at least try to restore the river as a
safe habitat. .

“A lot of people say it is not possi-
ble to clean up a large river like the
St. Lawrence,” he said. “But we don’t
know. That’s what science is all
about: finding solutions.”

‘ Why Cal's Usually Land on Their Feet

By Allan Paraclu'ni
Los Angeles Times

Sabrina, a long-haired mix--
ed-breed New York house cat,
played a role in unraveling a
long-standing animal mystery.

The young cat fell from the
32nd floor of a building to a con-
, crete sidewalk and suffered only a

"chipped tooth and a minor chest

injury, a feat that would seem to ‘
further the folkloric belief that fe-

lines have nine lives.

, From that case and others, now
comes a study focused on the cat’s
' superb internal gyroscope, which is
,s-the major reason for that folklore.

The inquiry concerns a phe-

nomenon called “highrise syn- 3
drome,” common in urban areas :
3with high concentrations of tall,
apartment buildings. It sheds new >1
; light on quirks of cat behavior that

,‘are often little understood by hu-

z’f’imans. -

Most important, perhaps, it 9911;;

ways knoWn: Cats will almost al-
ways land on their feet.

At the same time, anothertenet
of human faith has been seriously
undermined: Cats, it turnsout, are
capable of potentially disastrous
. miscalculations or just plain clumsy

footwork.

The new study looks at 132 cats
that fell from great heights —— an
average of 51/2 stories and a range of
from two to 32 floors —— and were
treated at the Animal Medical Cen-
ter, a large veterinary hospital in

New York.

Doctors there did thesurvey
after one noticed what he initially
thought was an extraordinary num-
ber of cats being brought in after

reported falls.

Despite the distances they fell,
90 percent of the cats surVived andl
60 percent required no medica
treatment or comparatively. minor
care. The others had corrective sur-
gery or extensive .care and some-
times lengthy hospitalizations.

The study’s observations, pub-
lished this month in the Journal of
the American Vet
Association, are in stark contrast to
the outcomes for humans who fall.

are almost always fatal to humans,
and falls by children under 15 take
about 13,000 lives a year.

Humans who fall suffer cata-
strophic outcomes largely because
they often tumble uncontrollably,
hitting the ground head-first or at a
disastrous angle.

Cats are saved by their instinc-
tive resistance to tumbling —- but it
is such an innate skill that veteri-
nary experts agreed it cannot be
taught, transferred or in any way
used to benefit humans.

It has long been known that
cats tend to land on their feet after
a fall. They turn legs downward as if
expending landing gear as soon as
they start to fall —— regardless of
their position when the tumble be-
gins. This study, however, adds new
detail to that phenomenon.

Once the gyroscopic turn oc-
curs, said Dr. Wayne Whitney, the
New York City veterinarian who
led the research, a cat instinctively
uses aerodynamics and its supple
musculature to its advantage.

In short falls, Whitney said, a
cat tends to hit the ground with its
legs fully extended, using its exten-
sor muscles ——- the muscle groups
that cause limbs to flex outward —-
and connective tissues as natural
shock absorbers.

In longer falls, Whitney said.
cats apparently spread their legs
‘ _-..,..._w-m..--..- ,__

farther apart, changing aerodynam-
ic drag in much the same way as
flying squirrels.

The increased drag, Whitney
, said, permits cats to hit the ground
Z with the leastpossible force. A cat
i reaches its maximum impact speed,
60 miles per hour, after the equiva-

,_ lent of a seven-story fall.

Of the 132‘cats that fell, he said,
3 l3 plunged more than nine stories.

A... ,W”.p.......— . ,

* Ninety percent of the cats suffered _

,some sort of chest injury -— al-

though most were minor and eaSily
treated. Most of those injuries in-

., volved air escaping from the lungs
into the chest cavity on impact.

There was an about equal inci-
dence of broken legs, with 39 per-
f'cent of the cats breaking or crack-
ing at least one bone. Four cats
broke their pelvises. Ten cats had
fractures of both front and rear

legs.

‘ Only three of the 132 cats w _.
éseen falling. But Whitney said ail;
{all the falls seemed to have resulted
from cats miscalculating when they
. turned or jumped, not paying atten-

tion during play, or becoming dis- '
agactted while stalking insects or ro-
n s. '

One of the observed fall
, 5 occur-
; red when the cat miscalculated
while lunging at an insect.

, “I think the curiOus nature of
f the cat is important here,” Whitney
5 said. “It's curious and it’s naturally a
f daredevrl. A cat will get out on a
, narrow ledge and take chances A

lot of the time, a dog won’t do that.”

The peculiar survival 5 '
3 cats originates deep in the ileiigef
; inner-ear canal, which is equipped
5 With what is apparently the most
complex balancing apparatus of
any animal, said Dr. Ralph Kitchell
an animal neurologist at the Univer:
Slty of California at Davis. It lets a
cat automatically right itself even

when it is fallin in co *
ness. g mplete dark-

Excellent night vision helps
too, because the cat is thoueht to
check its horizon visually as part of
the process in which legs and hips

 

{ torque it right side up. The gyro

action occurs before the cat has
; dropped two or three feet. The skill
: lS innate, Kitchell said.

The neurological anomaly is
found in all cat species, but it is
most significant in‘ house cats
which are small enough to hit the
ground with far less force than say

Thinning the Herd

Of Dumb Hunters

By ROGER SIMON

It is that time of year when the cry of the hunter is
heard in the land.

It is a Friday night on a farm in Maryland. Two men
are in a Chevy Blazer spotlighting deer.

Sp’otlighting is an illegal hunting technique whereby
you shine a bright light in the deer’s eyes, paralyzing it.

One hunter fires his lZ-gauge shotgun at a deer and
misses. He hands the gun to his companion in the pas-
senger seat and instructs him to load it with a special
deer slug. He continues to drive.

The companion loads the gun, the gun fires, hits the
driver in the chin and jaw, killing him.

It is August and the Tennessee Wildlife Resources
Agency issues the following statement about one of the
seven hunting deaths reported that season:

“In his excitement to climb a tree stand, the victim
put his loaded rifle in his coveralls with the muzzle
pointed upward. The hammer was in a cocked position

. and the rifle discharged as the victim climbed the
tree.”

I could go on. In fact, I could go on and on. A
computerized search of articles on hunting accidents in
1987 alone produced 217 stories, many of which dealt
with multiple deaths and accidents.

I have, in the past, made clear my position on hunt-
ing. It is only the dishonest hunter I quarrel with. Dis-
honest hunters are those who pretend what they are
doing is noble. That they are “learning about nature”
and “thinning the herd.”

The honest hunter, on the other hand, states his pur-
pose frankly: “I like having a few beers and killing
something stupider than me.”

An honest hunter also does not call hunting a sport.
A sport is an activity in which there is competition. In
other words, both sides have a chance of winning.

In hunting, the prey has no real chance. Hunters are
armed with high-technology rifles, ammunition, scopes,
scents, camouflage gear and other paraphernalia. All
this is designed to defeat whatever small chance ——
keen smell or eyesight, for instance — that the prey
might have.

The honest hunter claims only the fun of killing
something. The dishonest hunter tries to dress it up with
claims that he is thinning the herd of its weakest or
sickliest creatures. Sort of natural selection with a 12-
gauge. If we didn’t kill them, the claim goes, the beasts
would starve.

I have two problems with this: Many hunters don’t
want to kill the weakest or sickliest creatures. They
want to kill the nicest looking, healthiest ones so they
will look good as a trophy on the wall.

My other problem is: Who asked hunters to do the
work of nature? Maybe deer would prefer starvation to
being blasted by a guy in a tree.

I would. Honest. Let’s say I was starving in Ethiopia.
And some guy came along and said: “Look, you’ve got a
choice. Either some guy puts on camouﬂage gear and a
special scent and stalks you for hours and then blasts
you in the gut when you least expect it. Or you can
starve.”

I’d take starvation. Because who knows? I might get
lucky and find some food.

The idea of the do-gooder hunter who is thinning the
herd is a popular one, however. But as I was reading all
those stories about hunting accidents, a thought struck
me: Maybe hunting is nature’s way of trimming the
herd. Not the animal herd. The human herd.

The death or injury of any human is tragic. And I
take no pleasure from hearing about it. But if hunters
didn’t shoot themselves or each other, gosh darn it, who
else could we depend on?

Say no to furs

IT IS PART of a newspaper’s
responsibility to evidence a con-
science regarding matters relat—
ing to environmental issues and
the lives of our fellow creatures.
To this end, I found an article
about. furs in the Dec. 9 issue
quite offensive.

t is apparent that your paper
did not even consider the cruel
and inhumane ways in which a
fur coat comes to be, either by
the trapping or raising of ani-
mals under adverse conditions.
It would seem that you condone
this slaughter of defenseless ani-
mals in the name of vanity.

I am extremely disappointed
in your paper for portraying furs
as fun and fashion. A fur coat is
unnecessary in Dallas. and there
are many other types of attrac-
tive coats available. I suggest
you give the animals, who are
not able to speak for themselves
equal time in your paper.

An article. revealing the pro-
cess of making fur coats would
inspire much-needed public
awareness. Include, for example.
the life and death of a mink on a
mink farm. There are other peo-
ple like me, who refuse to wear
fur coats, who would be pleased
to see this type of informative
article.

Rare reptile is still legal stew
for Floridians

Activists seek ban on hunting
threatened gopher tortoise,

a gentle lookalike for ET.

By Sy Montgomery
Special to the Globe

hen he’s not out hunt-
ing. or catching and
relocating nuisance
alligators for the
State of Florida.
Rufus Stratton earns his living as
a professional gopher puller.

Thejob has nothing to do with
the furry. squirrel-like mammal.
“Gopher." in Florida at least. is
shorthand for the lS-inch-long.
burrow-dwelling gopher tortOise.
one of North America’s largest
land tortoises. And pulling go-
phers means getting the reptiles
out of the deep. twisting burrows
that give them their name.

Heading out for a gopher pulling
expedition — he's been all over the
state on them — Stratton carries a big
potato sack and a ﬂexible 20-foot-long
plastic PVC pipe with a hook on the
end. fashioned out of a bedspring. Once
he spots a gopher hole. he threads the
pipe down, until the hook catches. with
luck. under the back of the tortoise‘s
shell. Then. he says. l“you lean back
with your legs. reach up and get a grip
and pull. then another grip and pull. It
takes a lot of power. Sometimes you hit
a rock and the hook slides off and he
runs back down to the bottom. Some-
times it'll take 30 minutes or longer to
get him out of there."

Stratton. who lives in St. Augustine.
does much of his pulling these days for
scientists who are worried about the
survival of this increasingly rare reptile
(Gopherus polyphemus) and are study—

ing how it lives. Stratton also pulls for
conservationists who move tortoises
from place to place in a shrinking habi—
tat to try to keep ahead of developers.
But from October through Decem—
ber. when Florida law permits the cap-
ture of gophers for food. Stratton pulls
a few for himself. “You cook him up
with some peppers. onions and pota—
toes. some good brown gravy. he’s
mighty good eating.” Stratton said.
"Tastes about like beef." In fact. feast—
ing on gopher stew is an election day

A GOPHER TORTOISE IN FLORIDA

tradition in parts of Florida, where 90
percent of the remaining tortoise go—
phers live.

Ironically. in the western part ofthe
gopher tortoise’s range. which extends
into Mississippi. the animal is on the
federal government's threatened spe~
cies list: you could be fined $20,000 and
jailed a year for killing one. But in the
eastern part. including all of Florida.
there's not only no federal protection.
there’s a legal state hunting season.

Conservationists want the hunting
stopped completely. The gopher tortoise
is close to extinction. many say. and if
it disappears. dozens of other species -

. among them. the federally endangered

indigo snake. the rare Florida mouse,
the burrowing owl — may go with it.
Eighteen species of reptiles. amphib-
ians. mammals and birds and 39 spe-
cies of insects depend on the gopher tor-
toise’s burrows for humid refuge from
the hot southern sun.

To horse and cattle ranchers. how—
ever. the burrows are a nuisance: live—
stock stumble in the crescent—shaped
holes and break their legs. Developers
complain the holes mar manicured
lawns. Even Smokey the Bear seems to
be down on the creature: When land is
protected against natural fires. the go-
pher's pine—sandhill habitat becomes

overgrown. and sunlight can't
reach the burrow mounds to heat
its eggs or grow the grasses and
herbs it eats.

“‘The gopher tortoise is one of
the most controversial critters
we've got,” said Joan Diemer, a
wildlife biologist with Florida’s
Freshwater Fish and Game Com~

mission, in a recent telephone in- -

‘terview. “To some, it’s a delightful‘
little‘critter who looks like E.T. To
others, it’s food in the pot; to oth-
ers, it’s a nuisance."

, In seven years of studying the
tortoise. Diemer has put herself at
the center of the controversy -—
and come out on the side of the
tortoise. Last month, she proposed
that the state abolish the hunting
season ,' a step the Gopher Tortoise
Council. a private conservation
group. has been advocating for
nearly a decade. The state is
studying public comments on the
proposal and will rule on March 4.

Outside of Florida, there aren’t
many places a gopher tortoise can
call home. The tortoise digs its
lburrow, which may be 40 feet long
and 18 feet deep. only in dry,
sandy soils, usually among stunt-
ed stands of pine and oak. Two
hundred years ago. there were 70
million acres of prime habitat in
the southern part of the nation,
says Tallahassee researcher Bruce
Means: today there *are less than
10 million acres scattered in Lou—
isiana, Mississippi, Georgia,
South Carolina. Alabama and
Florida. No one knows how many
tortoises are left. but Means
thinks the number is less than a
tenth of what it once was.

A survey of the gophers was be-
gun in 1980 by John Pulliam of
the US Fish and Wildlife Service,
with the goal of winning federal
gsprotection for the species through-
out its range. Before he could fin-
ish. however. another study docu-
mented that the western popula-
tion was in serious trouble.

' Biologist Ren Lohoefener, who
authored that study. found go-
phers were nearly extinct in Lou—
isiana. in Mississippi, they were
declining fast. Alabama’s gopher
tortoises were declining less dra—
matically, but their predicament
was worrisome.

5‘1 had no justification not to
list the western population and
wait for the other data." Pulliam

. said: that data could be years in

coming. The western population -— =

in sectith of Alabama, most of
Mississippi and throughout Lou-
isiana — were accorded federal pro-
tection last July, making it a fed-
eral crime to kill one. (The practice

of according federal protection to
an animal in only part of its range

is not unique. The .grizZly‘bear. for
5 instance, is not federally protected
? in Alaska.)

Lohoefener and his wife. Dr.
Lynn Lohomeier, did the survey
while he was a research associate
at Mississippi State University.
but in their spare time, at a per—
sonal cost of $13,000. They didn’t
have enough time or money to sur-

vey their entire range. He has al-

ways had a soft spot in his heart
for the reptile. “I’ve always liked
things that live in holes, and eco-
logically, this species is terribly
important," Lohoefener said.
“The real reason I went to all this
work was to, perhaps,_ make Flor-
ida quit hunting them."

.Action urged now
The western population,.

though now protected, may be so
small it’s too lateto save the spe-
cies there, Lohoefner believes, but
in Florida, the only state where
killing the tortoises is legal, there
are still enough to survive “if
steps are taken now."

Joan Diemer is taking some of
those steps. She has captured.
measured, marked and freed 378
tortoises, followed their social
lives 82nd ,travels, and surveyed
their habitat. Her studies portray
the homsly gopher as a gentle. so—

 

cial vegetarian, a gardener in the
desert that helps other species
survive, a harmless desert denizen
under siege from civilization.
Although each tortoise has its
own burrow, "they’re very social
for reptiles," Diemer says. 'They
generally live in loose colonies of
15 to 50 individuals. They “play
musical burrows," visiting each
other (usually. the males call on
females), swapping burrows and
digging new ones perhaps 10

. times a year.

The burrows provide humid

‘ refuge for many other animals, in-

cluding some that take their
names from the tortoise — the go~
pher cricket, gopher frog and go-
pher tick live nowhere else but in
gopher tortoise burrows. The tor-
toise also helps the plants that
share its dry. sandy habitat. As it.
digs its burrows, the tortoise
brings nutrients to the surface.
and its droppings enrich ‘the nu-
trient-poor soil. ”Gopher habitat
without gophers would be a poo

place.” Diemer said. i. , , .v

The world. in fact, would be a
poorer place without gopher tor-
toxses, asserts Ellen Nicol of An-
thony. Fla. She is secretary of the
Tortoise Council. a 250-member
organization that grew out of a
group of reptile hobbyists in 1978.

We look out our window and see
a little tortoise trucking along
and ’it’s like a rock moving:
They re so homely they’re cute.”
, While some tortoisers have
been reportedly killed by stock—
men. habitat destruction is the
most widespread threat. Some is ‘
duelato. conversion of wild lands to ;

agriculture, reforestation and to
mining. But mostly, homes are-to
blame. “Seven thousand new peo-
ple move to Florida each week .—
and most of them prefer to live on
dry land.” Diemer said. "Until re-
cently, not much was done with
sandhills. But in a lot of areas.
that’s the only‘place left to build
that’s not wet." ~ .

With .fewer and fewer places
left to go. the remaining gophers
are more conspicuous and more
vulnerable to pullers. One of
Diemer’s colleagues, associate cu—
rator Richard Franz of the Florida
State Museum. says he’s seen
pickup trucks full of gopher tor-
toises. The state restricts the go-
pher catch to two per person per, }
day during the hunting season. 1
but researchers say the limit is
difficult to enforce.

Outlawing hunting, Diemer
says. would be only a first step to-
ward protecting the animal. Wild
lands must be preserved, she says.
and Florida needs to develop a
plan to set aside more protected
habitat for the tortoise. ,

If the gopher is to make a come—
back. it will be a slow one. A fe-
'male is anywhere from 10 to 20
years old when she lays her first
clutch of five to seven eggs. Most
are destroyed by predators. Only
one nest in 10 yields hatchlings,
Diemer says. and they are vulner—
able to predators -— skunks and
hawks - until they’re about three
years old. The one thing working
in the gopher’s favor is its life-
span: lt lives about 60 years.

Puller Stratton maintains that
it is not the pullers’ fault that go-
pher numbers are declining, it’s
the fault of the developers. But if
outlawing hunting the reptiles
will help save them, he says he’ll
abide by the law. To preserve the
animal, he says, would be worth
foregoing even the traditional elec-
tion day gopher stew.

esidents welcome  ' wildlife i0 yards

By NANETTE HOLLAND
Tribune Staff Writer

ST PETERSBURG --— If you have wings, fur,
feathers or claws, chances are you’ll like Emma
Axtell’s back yard.

And you will be welcome there. After all, Ax-
tell’s yard is a certified wildlife refuge.

Under a program instituted in 1973 by the
National Wildlife Federation, a non-profit conser-

vation organization based in Washington, resi-'

dents can have their back yards registered as
mini-refuges for wildlife.

More than 5,400 people have participated in
the program, 227 of those in Florida. Fourteen
backyard refuges are certified in Pinellas Coun-
ty.

Residents interested in applying for certifica-
tion must demonstrate that their yards provide
four basic elements essential to a good wildlife
habitat: food, water, cover and places for birds
or animals to raise their young.

Those elements can be supplied simply by

installing bird feeders and watering dishes and
building a brush pile in a corner, said Antoinette
Pepin, director of the backyard wildlife program.

“It’s a way to make people aware of the wild-
life around them and encourage them to think
about those animals when they’re gardening or
landscaping,” she said.

Once an application is received, Pepin said, it
is reviewed by a panel of naturalists to deter-
mine if the back yard is suitable for wildlife. If
the verdict is favorable, the applicant is sent a
handsome certificate applauding him or her for
“efforts on behalf of wildlife.” The applicant’s
back yard also is registered as an official mini-
refuge with the National Wildlife Federation.

Size is no obstacle to participating in the pro-

 

gram. Pepin said small back yards, office court-
yards and even common areas shared by condo-
minium residents can be made just as attractive
to birds and other wildlife as large estates.

Axtell’s yard on Fourth Avenue in south St.
Petersburg is proof of that. On less than an acre,
using trees and bushes planted by a previous
owner, Axtell has created a peaceful sanctuary
for birds, turtles, opossums and squirrels.

She applied for certification as a backyard
wildlife refuge in 1986, after reading about the
program in a magazine. Then she documented
the types of wildlife that commonly visit her
yard.

A variety of birds flit in and out of the mag-
nolia, orange and avocado trees, while squirrels
munch on seeds placed in feeders throughout the
yard. Small rodents occasionally stop by for a
drink of water, and an opossum Axtell calls Fred
sometimes steals onto her porch for a taste of
dog food.

Axtell proudly displays her National Wildlife
Federation certificate above the fireplace of her
small, cypress wood house. She says the honor
“adds a little officialdem to my hobby.”

Common birds such as blue jays, cardinals
and sparrows are everyday visitors to Axtell’s
yard, but she also has sighted more unusual birds
such as ringed turtle doves. Axtell says she pur-
chases 30 to 40 pounds of bird seed each week.

“I love to watch the animals, so it’s great
entertainment,” she said. “And the animals seem
to know it’s here. ”

The backyard wildlife program gives resi-
dents a chance not only to enjoy wild creatures,
but also to help preserve them by providing al-
ternate sources of food and shelter when their
natural habitat is destroyed by development.

That is a strong motivation behind Ethel Con-
nolly’s participation in the program. Connolly, a
city councilwoman in Pinellas Park, first certi-
fied her 21/2-acre property as a wildlife habitat in
1980. Every year, Connolly adds something new
to her miniature refuge. Most recently, she plant-
ed milkweed to attract butterflies.

She says the program is “one of the most
rewarding things I’ve ever done.” But she is wor-
ried about the future of some of her wild guests.
Connolly has noticed that some types of wildlife
appear to be declining.

“We used to have several large king snakes
around, but we haven’t seen any lately,” she said.
“I suspect they’ve been killed.”

Like Axtell, Connolly has dozens of winged
visitors, including pileated woodpeckers and a
bald eagle. She also has a few regulars that are
easily identifiable: two box turtles, one with only
three legs and one with a large dent in its shell.
“They live in my bromeliads,” she said.

Both Axtell and Connolly hope others will dis-
cover the joys of gardening for wildlife.

”People might think it takes more work than
it actually does, but even people with very small
yards can do it,” Axtell said.

Connolly stresses the importance of small ref-
uges to the overall survival of many types of
wildlife that otherwise might have no place else
to go.

“We have destroyed so much of what most of
us came to Florida for,” she said. “Every little
bit that can be preserved helps.”

Wildlife Federation’s backyard wildlife habitat
program, write the federation at 1412 16th St.

Agents cracking
down on hunters
who bait ducks

By NELSON BRYANT
of The New York Times

Because its law enforcement agents believe that
waterfowl baiting is on the increase, the us. Fish
and Wildlife Service is cracking down on this long-il-
legal practice.

Baiting is the use of corn or grain to lure ducks
and geese within shotgun range. The usual approach
is to broadcast it in the shallows surrounding a blind.
The birds cannot resist this easily obtained food, as
the market gunners of years past well knew.

Incredible numbers — the estimates range as
high as 400 million — of waterfowl were present
when the first settlers arrived in North America. By
the 18703, however, when railroads penetrated much
of the country, an incredible assault had been mount-
ed on ducks and geese by both market gunners and
members of hunting clubs.

It was not unusual for a gentleman hunter to bag
80 ducks in a single day, and some of the market
hunters did even better. The waterfowl taken by the
latter were shipped to cities to supply a seemingly
insatiable demand for wild birds by discriminating
diners. In most states in the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, hunting was allowed in the spring as well
as the fall.

By 1900, waterfowl populations had been cut in
half, and in 1918 this country and Canada signed the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act, which ended the sale of
waterfowl, banned spring shooting, shortened the fall
season and set daily bag limits of 25 ducks and 8
geese. The daily limit in the northeastern United
States is currently four ducks and three geese, and
the North American waterfowl population is current-
ly estimated at 75 million.

The federal duck stamp program was begun in
1934, and shortly thereafter, baiting and the use of
live decoys was banned, automatic and repeating
shotguns had to be plugged so that they would hold
no more than three shells and those larger than 10
gauge were prohibited. Money from the sale of duck

Ducks are easy targets for hunters who lure them within shooting range by putting grain on the

ground.

stamps, which all waterfowlers must purchase each
season, have been used to acquire land for waterfowl
refuges. A duck stamp cost $1 in 1934, and $10 this
year.

Today, nobody uses live decoys — or, also illegal,
recordings of wild birds calling —— to lure waterfowl
within range. That would be too obvious. Baiting has
died hard, however. I have not actually observed
waterfowl being baited for nearly 50 years, the last
time being when I was running my trap line in a salt
marsh on an incredibly still late afternoon in Novem-
ber. The fellow doing the baiting was more than half
a mile away, but I could hear the swish of the corn
as he broadcast it on the water.

In recent years, however, I have been in areas
where my guides or companions said that it was still
going on. One can be arrested for shooting over bait
even if one isn’t aware of its existence. A baiting
conviction can result in a $500 fine, six months in
jail, possible loss of one’s hunting privileges for sev-
eral years and confiscation of the gear — including
gun and boat —- one was using.

A law enforcement officer doesn’t have to dredge
up a peck of corn from the bottom around one’s
blind in order to make an arrest. A few kernels will
probably suffice. Such food may be set out in a hunt-
ing area before the opening of the waterfowling sea-
son, but it must have been eaten or removed at least
10 days before gunning begins.

Nick Brown and Fang

THE MAGAZINE. Dayton Daily News, Jan. 10, 1988 9

 




Fang is an American pit bull terrier, 45
pounds of tensed muscle, tugging and lunging
against the bond. His keeper, Nick Brown, has
invited me into his dog pen so that Fang and I
can get acquainted. He snaps the anchor line
on Fang and ushers him out of his kennel to
make a point: Not all pit bulls kill on sight. I’m
not so sure. He releases his grip on the dog’s
chain to add emphasis.

“You can’t abuse these dogs,” Nick says as I
look over at the nearby fence and calculate the
distance to it. “They’re not tobebeaten or they
get an attitude. They’re smarter than most
dogs. They can tell a lot more about people —-
like if you’re scared of them.”

I try to smile. I’m scared. I know I’m scared.
Nick knows I’m scared. I don’t mind that. I just
don’t want Fang to know I’m scared. I don’t
want him to get an attitude.

Nick’s four kennels resemble cages for wild
animals. In a way, they are. Four feet across,
four feet high, with chain-link roofs, chain-link
floors, plywood dividers. Each holds a pit bull:
4~year-old Dutchess, her lip severed in a sib-
ling brawl, yowls for Nick’s attention; 2-year-
old Bulls Eye champs on his kennel gate;
crazed, l8-month-old Sheba cuts circles, chas-
ing herself.

June 22, while a television crew captured the
violence for the evening news; and in Colum-
bus, 2-year-old Shannon Tucker, attacked by a
pit bull and a rottweiler, her limp body tossed
around like a rag doll. She died Sept. 27.

“It’s best to keep them from seeing each
other,” Nick says, returning my attention to
the present. “That way they won’t be tearing
each other up through the fence. Otherwise,
they’ll fight. That’s what they’re bred for. You
take two of them, turn them loose in the yard,
and they’re going to kill one another.”

Or something else.

Nick points to a grubby, 225-pound hog in a
nearby pen. Something is wrong with it. Some-
thing is missing. It doesn’t have any ears.

“This dog got loose and went after my hog,”
he says, again drawing my attention to Fang.
“He was in the kennel and he somehow got the
gate loose and slipped his collar.” As a boar
hunting dog, Nick explains, Fang immediately
locked his jaws onto the hog’s head and snout.
He didn’t plan to let go.

Fang is a “head dog.” The term’s used by pit
men to describe the animal’s fighting style.
Head dogs are highly prized animals among
dog fighters and hunters alike. They need not
bite hard. A head d or. clamps onto its rival from

other animal down. The harder a head dog’s
opponent struggles, the quicker the victory.

“You hunt these dogs three and four at a
time,” Nick says. “One dog will grab the head,
one will go for the stomach, one will grab the
tail, and they work as a team when they are
fighting a boar.”

The hog had little hope. Fang had ripped
both ears off and was holding on for the kill.
But a neighbor, hearing the victim’s squeals,
came running to the rescue, wielding a 6-foot
steel fence post. He beat Fang senseless, roped
his legs together and looked around for appre-
ciation. Nick wasn’t pleased.

Fang had lost a toe in the skirmish. His face
was swollen, his body coated with blood. But
when Nick’s brother Mike arrived on the scene
and the neighbor freed the animal, Fang rose
like a true American pit bull terrier. greeting
his former master Mike with a wag of thetail
and a friendly yelp. ‘

The incident didn’t play well inJamestown,
where Nick lives with Tina, his wife, and their
two children, Candy, age 10, and 6-year-old
Nicholas. Neighbors summoned the dog war-
den. Residents gathered signatures for a peti-
tion that called for the immediate eviction of
the “vicious pit bulls.” And before nightfall,
the couple had lost forever the services of their
three teen-age babysitters.

“It was on my property,” Nick says. “It was
my hog, and they made a big deal out of it.”

The Browns say they at first only boarded
the pit bulls as a favor to Mike, Nick’s boar
hunting partner. They have since changed
their plans. “They thought we were going to
keep them,” Tina says. “Now that they got
that petition up, there ain’t no way we’re
getting rid of them. I’d love to have seen that
dog bite that guy who was out there beating on
him. I wouldn’t have loved to see him put in the
hospital or anything like that, but I would have
loved to see that dog bite him.”

While the Browns’ relationship with the
community has been permanently scarred,
Fang, as is typical with pits, has fully recov-
ered. They’re warriors. Nothing stops them
until they’re stopped dead.

“If you hurt one, it doesn’t bother it.” Nick
says. “They’re killers. No doubt in my mind at
all, you can teach them to kill. And they will do
it. That’s the thing, they will die for you.

“A lot of people don’t realize what they’ve
got when they get them. They think, ‘Wow, I’ll
go pay my $150 and get me a pit bull.’ They
think they’ve got a house dog or a terrier of
some sort.

“There’s a responsibility there. If you don"t
treat them right and you don’t raise them
right, you could have a dangerous animal. You
could have a bomb. It could go off at any time.”

All across the country pit bulls are going off.
Or, more precisely, as Nick and others say, the
dog is being detonated by inexperienced and
abusive owners. Bred for pit fighting, original-
ly against bears and then against other dogs,
the pit bull quietly has intermingled in our
society for more than 200 years, chained in the
barns where their masters trained and fought
them.

It has been estimated that a half million pit
bull terriers live in the United States. Pit bull
is not a specific breed of dog. Rather it is a
generic catchall applied to dogs of mixed an-
cestry. The breeds most commonly identified
as pit bulls are the American Staffordshire
Terrier, the dog recognized by the American
Kennel Club, and the American pit bull terrier,
the dog of the United Kennel Club.

The inability of authorities to say defini-
tively what dogs are pit bulls has been the most
formidable legal obstacle in banning them.
Anheuser-Busch’s Spuds MacKenzie is not a
pit bull, though some people think he is. The
Bud Light party animal is a bull terrier. Pete,
the canine sidekick on the children’s show Our ‘
Gang, was a pit bull. So too was Buster
Brown’s ﬂoppy-cared tag-along Tige.

Pits weigh anywhere from 20 to 100 pounds.
Pound for pound, they are the most powerful
dogs alive. A 78-pound pit bull named Bighead
set a record in 1986 in Texas when he pulled
5,650 pounds 15 feet over rails.

Pits come in all colors. Their frames are
stubby, their chests are massive, their heads
brick-shaped, their muzzles wedge-like, their
hair short and their coats sleek. They are
tightly wrapped in muscle.

Pit bull owners describe their dogs much as
other animal lovers describe their pets. “You
can literally carry on a conversation with them
through their eyes,” says Donna Oliver of
Brookville, who breeds and shows pits. “No
one would think of owning a dog because it’s
humorous,” quips Steve Forbes, a pit owner in
Miamisburg. “But this dog is a walking
comic.”

Others say pit bulls are stubborn, tough,
emotional, intelligent but most of all loyal. For
some owners, this latter trait makes the physi-
cally menacing dog the perfect companion and
pet. For others, it makes the pit bull the
ultimate weapon.

Many pit bull owners agree with Nick that
the dog would rather die than lose a battle.
“When they’re fighting,” Nick says, “they’re

 




wagging their tails.” They will take on any
opponent. They are inherently aggressive to-
ward other animals.

Riding this reputation as a gladiator, the pit
bull has rapidly become the choice of some
working-class Americans, taking up quarters
in our cities and suburbs, ousting German
shepherds and Doberman pinschers from the
homes and hearts of many who want fierce
dogs.

Pit bull owners invariably talk of irresponsi-
ble owners and problem dogs, yet few seem to
know them. In passing, pit bull owners usually
brag that their pet is “just a big ole baby” or is
“wonderful with kids.” They say if their pit
even snapped at someone, they would take a
gun and shoot it themselves.

Still, these same owners inevitably have
“Pit Bull” stories to tell, stunning feats of
power and aggression. The woman whose dog
is “just a big ole baby” goes on to tell of how her
‘ dog has jumped through three sliding glass
doors without getting hurt, of how he once
terrorized a shopping center drug store after
getting loose. A man whose pit bull is “wonder~
ful with kids” relates how his dog regularly
kills the neighbors’ pets.

In addition to their blue-collar masters, pits
have fallen prey to street gangs, pimps, drug
dealers and thieves, many of whom use them
for protection and entertainment.

The clandestine dog fights in rural Ohio and
elsewhere in the nation are on the wane, being
replaced by the new amateur sportsman, who
lugs a six-pack of beer and some friends into
the basement on weekends for dog fights. Or
by young punks who fight pits in Dayton’s
Eastwood Park and along railroad tracks.

For many new owners, pit bulls are simply
the baddest dog on the block, a canine Rambo.
They unleash them to strut across an unfamil-
iar urban landscape.

And with tragic results.

Last year, pit bulls killed eight of the nine
people who died in confirmed dog attacks
nationwide. In the last two years, pits have
killed 15 of the 22 people who have died. Miami
Valley animal control officials say dozens of
pits roam neighborhoods where four years ago
there were none. In many areas, particularly
Old North Dayton and on the east side around
the HydroBowl, elderly residents and chil-
dren live in fear of their neighbors’ pets.

The dogs can frighten people without even
trying. “They look evil,” one owner explains.
But perhaps the owners themselves generate
much of the anxiety; people naturally question
the judgment, perhaps sanity, of anyone who
boards mature pit bulls in a matchbox house,
causing it to look and smell like a kennel. The
fatigue-clad gunman who killed his estranged
wife, her former boss, a stranger and then
himself last fall near Dallas appreciated pit
bulls, along with camouflage clothing, weap-
ons, anti-personnel mines and munitions. Po-
lice discovered eight pit pups in the gunman’s
van after the shooting Spree. Likewise, an
Edmond, Okla., ex-marine who killed himself
and 14 fellow postal workers in the summer of
1985 kept a pit bull, a cache of weapons and a
guidebook to the Soviet Union in his small
home.

Six months ago, following William Eek-
man’s death, Ohio lawmakers, in an effort to

hold owners reSponsible for the actions of their
powerful pets, passed a new vicious and dan-
gerous dog law, the first state law of its kind.

The law brands dogs as dangerous when
they try to attack without provocation. They
are vicious when they bite or kill without
provocation. But what makes the law unique is
that it lumps all pit bulls into the category of
vicious dogs, requiring their owners to cage
them and carry $50,000 liability insurance if
they cannot prove the dogs are harmless.

Few of the pit bull owners interviewed for
this story were aware of the law. Few cared.
Most still permit their pits to roam without
leashes. Only one couple was insured in case of

certain pit. In such cases, the SPCA aids the
police department in answering calls.

Dates says identifying pit bulls also is a
problem, a legal one. People who once licensed
their dogs as pit bulls now license them as
“mixed breeds.” Who can say they’re not?

Breeders and owners promise legal chal-
lenges to the state and city laws, which they
say amount to nothing more than “canine
racism.” In many places, including Ohio, cases
are already on the dockets. Owners say politi-
cians have manipulated pit bull hysteria for
political gain. Pit bulls make a perfect election
issue, they say. Nobody favors dog attacks,
and pit bulls do not vote.

Meanwhile, away from the legal and politi-

Dayton police ofﬁcer had to shoot pit bull when the dog attacked him

an incident.

Nearly 80 municipalities nationwide have
considered outlawing pits. About half of them,
including Cincinnati, have done it. In Cincin-
nati, though, the law has not eliminated pits.
According to Harold Dates, general manager
of the Hamilton County SPCA, it simply has
warned pit owners to control their pets.

Dates says enforcing the ban is a major
problem. It’s a city ordinance, so the police
department must round up the pits. But the
police don’t have the equipment to transport
animals nor the room to house them. Cops,
Dates says, are not interested in dog catching.

The result is that the law isn’t really a law at
all. It’s a message: Keep your pits inside and
keep them out of trouble. The ban is only
enforced when someone complains about a

cal bickering, the battle drags on between two
very unlikely opponents: Man, and one of
Man’s most loyal friends, the American pit
bull terrier.

Those who know and love the pit bull, blame
Man. They say vicious dogs are a product of
abuse and neglect, not breeding. Look into the
eyes of any menacing pit bull, they say, and
you will see the darker side of human nature.

“It’s the owners that are the problem,” one
owner says. “It isn’t the dogs rounding up
other dogs to fight in the pits and the street
somewhere. The dog is already bad. He
doesn’t need any encouragement.”

Or, as Stephanie Gray, a Montgomery
County deputy dog warden, says: “There are a
lot of people with pit bulls out there who are not
fit to own stuffed animals.”

THE DEAD-EYE STARE

Pit bulls comprise about one percent of the
country’s dog population, according to the
Humane Society of the United States. Yet pits
have been responsible for 68 percent of the
recent fatalities. Some of those include:

Two-week old Brian Lillis of Detroit. On
Dec. 4 a mixed pit bull-boxer mauled the sleep-
ing infant, snatching him from a car seat
positioned on a living room couch.

Two-year-old Shannon Tucker of Colum-
bus. A pit bull and a rottweiler killed the child
Sept. 27 as she played near her apartment
building. Neighbors said they had feared the
dogs, King and Bear, since they slaughtered a
cat earlier in the summer. “She only screamed
short and quick,” an eye-witness said. “They
tossed her around like a rag doll.”

Two-year-old James Soto of Morgan Hill
Calif. A neighbor’s pit mauled Soto on June 13.
A paramedic described the dead child as “un-
recognizable as a human being.” The pit, Wil-
ly, had been trained to guard his master’s
marijuana plants.

Even Darmstadter did not turn her back on
Bouncer and Buford. The 32-year-old woman
asked officials to return her “kids” to her.
They didn’t. The animals were destroyed
shortly after the trial.

“I guess what the verdict says is that mere
ownership of a pit bulldog that kills a human
being will not lead a jury to convict a defendant
of manslaughter,” says Dennis Langer, the
Montgomery County assistant prosecutor
who presented evidence against Darmstadter
and Rutledge. At least not in Ohio.

To obtain a criminal conviction, Langer
says, prosecutors must convince a jury beyond
a reasonable doubt that defendants knew
their dogs would kill. Sure-fire ways to do this
include demonstrating that owners had
trained the dogs to fight, or that owners had
ordered the dogs on victims, or that owners
had bragged about their killer dogs. Such was
not the case- in the Eckman tragedy.

Still, Langer says he was confident of his
evidence going into the trial. But the judge
refused to allow testiniony by animal control
experts who observed the dogs following Eck-
man’s death and felt the owners should have
known the animals were life threatening.
Without this testimony, Langer says he could
not prove the owners knew their dogs would
kill.

Defendants in other states haven’t fared as
well. In Decatur, Ga., Hayward Turnipseed
was convicted of manslaughter after a judge
permitted experts to testify concerning the
aggressiveness of a dog that killed a 4~year-old
boy in 1986. The trial climaxed with the testi-
mony of Randy Lockwood, an animal beha-
viorist and US. Humane Society director of
higher education who was barred from the
Eckman trial.

Langer says Ohio’s new tougher dog law
should help not only strengthen prosecutors

Sarah are not unusual. They say pit bull at-
tacks are particularly savage because they

most dogs, pit bulls rarely warn their victims

do not growl. They do not show their teeth.
They do not ﬂatten their ears, raise their

animal.

In July, in the first pit bull attack after
Ohio’s new dangerous andvicious dog law took
effect, a 40-pound dog named PeeWee bit 10-
year-old Sarah Lindsey of Middletown on the
face. The dog tore off the child’s lower lip and
part of her chin.

Neighbors found a piece of the girl’s lip and
plastic surgeons sewed it back in place. So far,
Sarah’s father Michael says, the youngster’s
medical bills have mounted into the thousands
of dollars. And for Sarah the ordeal isn’t over
yet. Doctors will operate on her again early
this year in an attempt to reduce scarring.

Meanwhile, PeeWee sits on death row at the
Butler County Animal Shelter, awaiting his
owner’s trial in municipal court. His master,
Marvie Watkins, refuses the prosecution’s
plea-bargain to drop all criminal charges if
Watkins destroys PeeWee. Watkins says Pee-
Wee may not have bitten the girl; he believes
the dog may have jumped up on to the child
with such force that she hit off her own lip.
Watkins says if PeeWee did snap at her, he’s
certain the pit meant no real harm.

killing it. Five of the shots struck the animal’s
head.

In Dayton, two pits attacked police officers
last July when they were called to quell a
family argument. The officers shot the dogs,
paralyzing one and wounding the other in the
face. Frequently, as officials say in this case,
the owners ordered the dogs to attack the
officers.

Harold Dates of Hamilton County’s SPCA
says a pit bull can be viewed as a weapon. “1
hate to compare it to owning a firearm,” he
says, “but it’s the best way to make it clear. In
the wrong hands, it is potentially a very dan-
gerous dog.”

And what makes pit bulls even more fright-
ening, says Jean Zimmer of the Montgomery
County Animal Shelter, is that they have
become so popular with so many people. “Who
in their right mind gets that kind of a dog ? ” she
wonders. She pauses, as if uncomfortable to
share her thought. “Except people who are out
to lunch.”

Who indeed.

 




I"

PROTECTION

“Ever seen a 70-pound pit and a 55-pound
pit sleeping in a king-size water bed with two
adults and a kid sometimes?” asks Tina Ev-
ans of Miamisburg. “If I look at them and say,
‘Come on, let’s go to bed.’ They’ll run back in
on the water bed. Boy, talk about cramped.”

Tina and her live-in boyfriend, Steve
Forbes, got together with me one Saturday to
set me straight on pits. The couple sleeps with
two pits, Sheba and Brutus, every night. Occa-
sionally, a pre-schooler, Tina’s sonJason, joins
them.

Tina and Steve fell in love over pits, five
years ago. Steve was pumping gas. Tina was
pushing pancakes. They worked next door to
each other and she’d come over to buy ciga-
rettes and pop at the station. Tina saw pic-
tures of Steve’s pits. She wanted one. Tina
bought a pit pup off Steve. A month later Tina
and Steve began dating.

“I have Brutus on command,” Tina says.
“Anything I tell him to do he does it.” Five-
year-old J a son chases Brutus around the living
room with a toy truck. Vroooom,
Vroooooooom, Errrrt. .

Tina used to live off Wayne Avenue. on
Dayton’s east side but she didn’t like city life.
She and the neighbors had words over Brutus.
The neighbors called the dog warden on her.
When the warden arrived, Tina demonstrated
her voice control over Brutus. The warden was
impressed. “Man, I’ve never seen a pit under
voice command like yours,” Tina recalls the
warden saying.

Tina and Steve keep pits primarily for pro-
tection. They worry about break-ins. They
may have reason. Two years ago, two masked
robbers, one wielding a shotgun, blasted out
the couple’s front door in Miami Township.
One of Steve’s pits lunged at the thieves, so
they blasted off the side of the animal’s face.

“She walked around the room probably
three or four times while they trashed the
living room,” Steve recalls. The dog diverted
their attention, buying Steve enough time to
grab a gun. Steve killed one of the intruders, as
he clutched $36 and the couple’s unpaid phone
bill. The other went to prison.

So Tina has taught Brutus how to attack.
Tina has a command for attack, only “attack”
isn’t the word that sets Brutus off. Tina has
control, voice control. With another command
word, Tina says she can halt Brutus’ siege,
instantly.

There are other command words: Mouse.
Spider. Wag your tail. Wag your tail harder.
Hit the road. Munchies. You got the munchies,
Brutus? And, of course, the regulars: Sit. Stay
Fetch. Go bye bye. And attack.

Brutus wants to plop his 70-pounds on
Tina’s lap. He props his feet on her, hoping to
escape the child’s reach. She orders the dog to
sit. Brutus leaps and leaps. “Sit. Sit. Sit,” she
says. Nothing.

Maybe the command word for sit isn’t "sit.”

“As far as protecting either one of us,” Tina
continues, ignoring Brutus’ disobedience, “I
do know he would do that. ’Cause a couple of
times, I’ve had people raise their fist back at

me with him sitting right there. He’d start
growling at them, daring them to do anything.
Which I was too. ‘If you’re dumb enough to do
it, fine.’ ”

Inpeople situations, Tina and Steve say pits
can’t be beat. They watch out for the couple’s
best interest.

“Put it this way,” Steve says, “I know this
guy up the road is a thief. The dogs know just
how I feel about him. So when the guy comes in
here they follow him around and growl right at
his feet, making sure he didn’t pick nothing up.
They know the guy’s not wanted here.”

Steve says pits are good watchdogs ——
though it would seem easier to simply not
invite such people into our homes. They let
people know when they don’t like them. And
what kind of person don’t they like?

According to Steve, the dogs dislike the
same people he dislikes. Steve‘says pits inter-
pret their owners’ intuitions better than any
other canine. “The dogs, they just kind of
sense this thing, you know. The dogs kind of
pick up on me, and they think the same way,
except they ain’t afraid to growl.”

Many reputable breeders say they no longer
sell pups to people shopping for guard dogs.
For many of them, it’s a question of survival.
The number of cities with pit bull bans grows
weekly, a result of what these breeders call
“media hype,” the preoccupation of journal-
ists with so-called sensational “Pit Bull Bites
Man” stories. These breeders do not want to

put the dog in a situation where itmight attack .

a person.

Even dog fighters say pits should not be
kept for protection. Richard Stratton, the pit
man and writer who dog fighters look to for
insight into the pit bull, says pit bulls should
not guard homes.

“Never tolerate a people-mean pit bull,”
Stratton admonishes pit men in his recent

book, The World of the American Pit Bull ‘

Terrier. “They are too dangerous, and they
are not typical of the breed’s true nature.
Unfortunately, some of my own good friends
seem to regard their own mean pit bulls as
protective. Pit bulls are not suppOsed to be
Doberman pinschers. They are just too formi-

_ dable to allow them to be that way!”

But besides protection, Steve and Tina just
plain adore pits. Steve has raised them for
seven years. His dogs are registered with the
American Dog Breeders Association. He’s got

their certificates, hanging on the living room ‘

wall, to prove it. When Steve wanted a litter,
be searched long and hard for a registered stud
to sire the pups. Brutus is a product of that
effort.

Brutus is Tina’s “big ole baby.” Tina just
loves on Brutus all the time. He’s never been a
problem, except once. Once Brutus did get out
of line. He growled at Tina. Tina set him
straight.

“He hasn’t done it since,” she says. “I hit
him in the face with my fist. He growled at me
again. So I hit him again. And I said, ‘Growlat

me again.’ He didn’t do it no more. I was so mad

at him, I didn’t even think of him biting me.”
Does she worry about her baby Brutus
hurting her baby Jason?

“If I thought there was a chance in the world
this dog was going to attack this baby right

there, I’d take him to the vet right now and
have him put to sleep. That’s how sure I am of
this dog.

“I can’t blame people for the way they think.
After all the stuf f that’s gone on with this Dr.
Eckman getting killed. It made me think what
that kind of dog can do. I sat back and I looked
at my dog, thinking, ‘What in the hell would I
do if that dog attacked?’ It never even hit me
what kind of damage that dog can do, until I
seen it on Phil Donahue.

“But I can’t get rid of him. That thing there
means as much to me as that one over there,”
she says pointing to Brutus, then to Jason.
“They’re both my kids, and I’ll defend them
both 100 percent if they’re in the right.”

THE BACKYARD BREEDER

Butch Sarver’s house in Mad River Town-
ship resembles a backwoods bunker: A single
story of concrete blocks, a yard of mud and
stumps. So do most of the homes in this work-
ing-class neighborhood, where refrigerators
and autos litter yards. Butch’s neighbors
speak the dialect of Tennessee, West Virginia
and Kentucky. Here, many people value a
good guard dog.

Butch has posted warnings on his 3-foot,
chain-link fence. A sign shows a dog with blood
dripping from its fangs, and the words,
WARNING. GUARD DOG. DO NOT EN-
TER. Not many visitors call.

Butch’s neighbors say he’s crazy. They fear
him. They keep their distance. They cite four
reasons for this. Butch calls them Gator,
Duke, Butch and Big’un. The neighbors call
them pit bulls.

Butch has banished the 14-month-old broth-
ers, Butch and Gator, to the kennels out back.
Two-year-old Duke lounges in the house. And
Big‘un, a 7-year-old pit, the monster of his
litter. roams where there is room. The dogs will
kill one another if their paths cross. The neigh-
bors worry about their kids crossing them.

Butch is a bachelor, a woodsman, a recluse
and a backyard pit bull breeder. Officials say
Dayton has many people like Butch, amateur
breeders who have taken just another dog and
made it one of the most familiar faces chained
in our yards.

Sixty-five thousands dogs are registered in
Montgomery County. Probably twice as
many live here. No one knows for sure, but
some authorities say 1,000might be pits.

Butch is unemployed. He has been for sev-
eral years. To get through lean times and
busy himself, he raises dogs. He sold German
shepherds when they were popular. He sold
Doberman pinschers when people wanted
them. He even tried breeding wolves, but the
yard was too small. A few years back Butch
switched to pits.

In 1981 Butch got his first pit, Mr. T., a
solid black dog with an oversized blocked
head. Pups brought $300 a piece then. There
was money to be had.

But by the time Butch had a litter of pits
in hand, the price had plummeted to around
$30. Today, he says, you can’t hardly give
them away. At least not to good homes.

Butch’s expertise on pits comes from
Stratton’s writings. His books include chap-
ters such as “Dimensions of the Dog Pit”
and “Fluid Therapy for Treating HypoVole-
mic Shock.” Butch has not read the new Ohio
dog law. He does not carry the $50,000 liabil-
ity insurance it requires.

Butch prides himself on
raising the dogs properly.
He refuses to sell pits to
teen-agers because he
thinks they will fight them
in back alleys and along
railroad tracks. Not all of
his customers have been
satisfied.
“I had several people that
brought them back,” he
.says. “They keep them in
the house and they’d leave.
When they came back, they
didn’t have any furniture.
The pit bulls would smell a
strange smell in the couch or-somewhere, and
they’d try to dig the smell out.”

Butch has had run-ins with the Humane
Society of Greater Dayton. Dog catchers
nabbed one of his pits after Butch left it in
the house for two days unattended. The
neighbors called. Butch was off fishing.

Another one of Butch’s pits, Lucky, broke
his chain early one morning, hopped the
fence and slew the next-door neighbor’s 80-
pound chow chow. “There was blood all over
the yard,” the chow’s owner, Hugh Cusick,
recalls. “He went berserk,” Butch says. “I
don’t know what happened.”

Lucky was a leg dog, a fighter not well
regarded by pit men. Leg dogs usually don’t
live long, which proved accurate in Lucky’s
case, but for another reason. Against the
chow, Lucky immediately dove for the ani-
mal’s front legs, crushing their bones, Cusick
says. Lucky finished off the chow by clamp-
ing onto its head. When Butch learned of the
bloody incident, he led Lucky out into the
woods and shot him. Those are the rules of
the game.

Says Butch: “Owners, they make or break
a dog. They can either be, responsible and
train a dog, teach a dog what it’s supposed to
know. Or they can teach a dog to kill, and it’ll
kill anything. I think there are certain people
that are not fit to be owners of any dog.”

THE BAD poo. nip-A PIT BULL WHEN A POODLE WON’T D0

Marvin Lee Rose is like a lot of lQ-year-olds.
He’s out of school and lives at home with his
mother, Eliza Pearl. He hasn’t been able to
find a job, at least not a permanent one. He
works odd jobs when he can. His days seem to
wander aimlessly by, filled with hours and
hours of smoking cigarettes, gulping beer and
staring at the TV. Not much seems to excite
Marvin Lee. But then again, maybe he doesn’t
have much reason to get worked up. For Mar-
vin Lee, today is a lot like yesterday, or
tomorrow.

In Marvin Lee’s world, two things seem to
matter: His hot rod street racer and his pit
bulls. His hot rod, a $0qu up ’67 Chevy Nova,
is parked in the front. His pit bulls —- a 2-year-
old brown marble bitch, a bleached white pup,
and Blackie, a 7-year-old pit bull-Doberman
pinscher mix — are penned in the backyard.
Marvin Lee is camped in between.

Everyone needs something to show off,
something to call his own, something to hold
up to the world. For Marvin Lee that some-
thing is a pit bull, better yet, three pit bulls. He
can get them to latch on to a rubber hose and
pull him through the neighborhood on his bike.
They play fetch. Wrestle. They’re just plain
fun,more fun,MarvinLeesays,than any other
dog, except maybe rottweilers.

“I don’t get into other dogs,” he says. “I just
don’t like them. They’re sooners. They’d soon-
er lay down than do anything. They’re lazy.
They don’t play or nothing.

“A pit bull will play with you. I want some-
thing thatI’m not ashamed to walk around the
block. A little poodle, man, somebody would
laugh at you if you walk it around the block.

“You know, you hear on the news that pit

. bulls kill people and stuff. It’s the way they

treat them, man. They just beat the . . . . out of
them, and they get tired of it.”

What dog wouldn’t? In Dayton, popular
methods to make pits mean include feeding
them gunpowder, and dog rolling (to roll dogs.
owners muzzle the pits then let them fight) .

In his expose on Philadelphia pit fighting,
Rolling Stone reporter Mike Sager wrote that
two street punks he interviewed trained their
pit bull by running him around the block
behind their bicycles and taking him on safari
looking for stray cats and dogs to kill. They
also fed him cheap dog food, leftover beans and
rice and chicken blood. For his wounds, they
shot him up with black-market penicillin and
vitamin B12 for quick healing.

“You feed them gunpowder,” Marvin Lee
says. “You don’t feed them a lot. You just put a

little on bread, and they eat it and an hour later .

their head. . .it gets a headache. It won’t let
nobody around it. It goes haywire.”

Some of Marvin Lee’s friends ﬁght their
pits, and they go haywire. He says he doesn’t.

Marvin Lee used to tool around with
Blackie in the hot rod. When Marvin Lee went
into a store or stopped to meet friends, he’d roll
the window down part way, leaving Blackie in
charge. Nobody’d mess with the hot rod with
Blackie there. Mess with the hot rod and
you’re messing with Marvin Lee. Mess with
Marvin Lee and you’re messing with Blackie.

Mess with Blackie and you’re dead.

But Marvin Lee and Blackie don’t cruise
anymore. One day in mid-May Blackie ate the
hot rod’s front seat after Marvin Lee aban-
doned him for several hours in 8&degree heat.
Animal control officers for the Greater Dayton
Humane Society liberated the animal.

Sandra Phelps, executive director of the
society, says a veterinarian treated the pit for
heat exhaustion. They took Marvin Lee into
Vandalia Municipal Court. fighting for custo-
dy of Blackie. But the judge ruled in Marvin
Lee’s favor. The humane society lawyer
wasn’t able to prove that Marvin Lee locked
the dog in the car.

Marvin Lee’s friend Jim comes over to work
on the hot rod. They disappear. Marvin Lee’s
mother Eliza continues talking.

“I don’t mess with the dogs because I’ve had
Open heart surgery. I can’t.”

Eliza worries because Blackie can jump
their 3-foot-high fence. She worries about the
dog running loose. Not because she thinks it
will attack anyone. But because it might do
something that will get Marvin Lee in trouble.
Eliza worries about Marvin Lee.

Eliza explains that she’s diabetic. Her blood
sugar is low. She passes out sometimes. A while
ago she passed out and fell flat on her face. Two
black eyes. “Everybody tried to say Marvin
Lee hit me,” Eliza says. “But I passed out."

The neighbors complain incessantly says
Eliza. They dial the police every time Marvin
Lee revs up his hot rod. It sounds more like an
explosion than a car. They call the dog catcher
over Blackie all the time. “My nosy neigh-
bors,” Eliza calls them.

Outside, the hot rod
BOOOOOOOOOOOM.

A PRIZE WINNING BREED ‘

At the age of 3, Rudy is a model guy, a
winner, a grand champion. He’s obedient,
charismatic, handsome. He has the classic
brick-shaped head of the ideal pit bull. He has
the flat skull with the prominent cheeks free of
wrinkles. His muzzle is wide, square and deep.
His jaw, pronounced, hinting of enormous
strength. His coat is chocolate red. His eyes sit
far apart, his neck is muscular, slightly arched.
His shoulders are firm, with the wide sloping
blades.

Rudy’s one hell of a friendly, attractive dog.
He is to the canine world what Arnold Schwar-
zenegger is to body building. At 65 pounds,
Rudy couldn’t look better if he worked out at
Nautilus. Watching Rudy perform for judges
at a show is like watching a Mr. Universe. In
the world of dogs, Rudy is Mr. Universe.

But Rudy is more than a bundle of virile
good looks. He has character, too, say his
owners, Glenn and Donna Oliver of Brook-
ville. He showed it the day last fall when he was
judged a United Kennel Club grand show
champion. Rudy is, after all, an American pit
bull terrier.

ignites.

 




Rudy and Glenn ﬂew to Indiana for the
show. They played fetch to pass time an hour
before Rudy was up. Rudy jumped up for the
stick, and the stick smacked his jaw, breaking
it. A tooth split. So did Rudy’s gum and lip.
Rudy bled everywhere. .

Glenn led him back to the ring, and today
describes what happened by saying, “He took
best of winners that day, out of 500 dogs. He
showed that he had heart. That he wanted to
show and to do what I wanted him to do, even
though he felt terrible and I was wiping the
blood from his mouth. He would lean up to me
and give me a lick on the cheek, as if to say, ‘I’ll
do it for you.’ ”

Rudy’s no ordinary dog.

Glenn and Donna breed pits like Rudy to
show and sell. Being a pit bull, Rudy has a
problem —- people want to exile him from our
society. Being Rudy’s owners, Glenn and Don-
na have a problem — people out there want
Rudy’s carcass. Being a journalist, I have a
problem -— Glenn and Donna say I’m the
reason people hate Rudy.

I don’t hate Rudy.

Glenn and Donna are no ordinary dog own-
ers. They seem to be for pit bulls what Bible
thumpers are for Jesus. They love their pits,
perhaps as much as their children. They want
you to love their pits, too. They have a mes
sage: Pit bulls are wonderful, pit bulls are
Rudy. They proselytize. They become impas.
sioned if you question. Either you’re part of
the solution, or you’re part of the problem.

Glenn, Donna Oliver with Rudy

I am part of the problem.

Glenn and Donna agreed to meet me any-
way because they believe the public misunder-
stands Rudy and his breed.

They were reluctant. Earlier on the phone,
Glenn said he would consent only if I wrote a
story promoting pit bulls. He wanted me to
promise that I would. “Think about it,” he
said. “Make sure you want to do a good article.
It’s a gentleman’s type agreement. But if you
don't do a good article, I’ll be upset.”

Later, when we finished the interview,
Glenn asked if he could read my story before it
ran. I said no. He smiled a seemingly knowing
smile, as if expecting my answer. I noticed then
that he had secretly taped our interview.

Glenn and Donna say journalists often err
when identifying breeds in stories. They do
not correct their mistakes. For journalists,
they say, anything that bites is a pit bull.

Glenn saysaGermanshepherd nearly killed
his son Billy four years ago. No reporters
called. He says a malamute mauled a 4-year-
old in Dayton last July. The child was sewn
back together with 284 stitches. No reporters
called. Glenn says he called them. He says
they weren’t interested.

“If that would have been one stitch from a
pit bull, or one snap from a pit bull, it would
have been front page news,” he says. “You
don’t hear about the German shepherds that
are doing the relentless biting. You don’t hear
about the Doberman pinschers that are doing
the relentless killing. You hear about the pit
bulls.”

Right.

“I get calls all the time from people that are
getting thrown out of their apartments just
because of the name. Not because the dog has
bitten something, or not because the dog is
overly aggressive. Everybody is scared to
death because all they’ve been told about are
the fatalities.”

Glenn does not view pits as a threat to
anyone. He says not one fatal dog attack has
involved a true pit bull. He is ready with the
statistics that put it all in perspective. He says
more kids were killed on playground equip-
ment than by dog bites in 1985, that pit bulls
are responsible for less than one percent of all
dog bites.

Glenn travels all over the country, Rudy at
his side, visiting pits and showing his own. He
has several others besides Rudy. He hasn’t
encountered any problems. He’s seen nearly
10,000 dogs. However, Glenn says he has not
driven around neighborhoods in Dayton
where people breed pits in their basements and
backyards.

“That’s what we don’t know.” Donna says.
“All the people we know that have the dogs are

_

that I’m not

like us. We can send you to homes of people all
over the state. I mean, they’re just like us. It’s
two classes here.”

But the Olivers’ class. nice as it is, is the
smaller of the two. Glenn presides over the
Miami Valley Pit Bull Terrier Club, which has
only 40 members.

The Olivers breed their dogs for tempera.
ment and beauty, not fighting prowess. In
eight years, they have produced three litters of
pups. They will not sell pits for fighting. They
will not sell them for protection. They offer a
$50 rebate to buyers who finish an obedience
course with their pet.

The Olivers support tough vicious dog laws,
but they vehemently oppose outlawing specif-
ic breeds.

“Sure, there’s a problem,” Glenn says, “but
if you take a person’s pit bull away from him,
you know what he’s going to do? He’s going to
go out and buy a rottweiler. He wants a protec-
tive dog. He wants something to promote his
macho image that possibly he can’t promote.
Normally, the person who has a macho dog has
a macho ego to start with. Some people do not
need to own these breeds. It’s a physically
powerful dog. That does not make him an
unsound dog or aggressive toward people.”

“Banning means extinction,” Donna says.
“And extinction means forever. You’re going
to be doing away with our good dogs — dogs
that are Pete from Spanky and Our Gang,
along with these idiot dogs that owners and
breeders have created out there.”

“It makes you angry,” says Glenn. “I work
hard, damnit, to protect my breed. My life
revolves around my dogs.

“There’s a love and attachment, and I do
love my dogs. There’s no doubt about it. I love
them as much as I love my kids. Well, there’s
two steps. There’s people, and then there’s
dogs.

“And we love our prize pets. We want to take
them out and show them to everybody, and
hope they love them as much as we do.

“It’s our life. It’s all we do.” 0

sk school—aged children in

North Fulton or Cobb coun-

ties what their favorite field
trip is and chances are the answer will
be the Chattahoochee Nature Center.
Located in a picture-book setting along-
side the Chattahoochee River on \\'illeo
Road in Roswell (about two miles west
of the Roswell Road Bridge and only a
rock's throw from the Cobb County
line]. the Chattahoocl‘iee Nature Center
has grown to be a familiar landmark to
countless thousands of Atlanta-area res—
idents. Not only is the Center a "fun"
place to visit. but few people - either
young or old — ever leave its magical
doors without gaining a much clearer
understanding about the delicate and
complex natural world in which we all
(Jo-exist. oftentimes to the detriment of
the environment.

The Chattahoochee Nature Center
was established in 1970 by a group of
concerned citizens a: private. non—
profit. commui‘iity facility dedicated to
environmental education. Through the
cooperative efforts of Fulton County.
The Georgia Heritage Trust Fund. the
Natural Science for Youth Foundation.

uals. the Nature Center opened its
doors 1] years ago on a meager six-acre
site overlooking a sizable chunk of
”\zvorthless” Chattahoochee River
marshland.

Today. the Center occupies approxi-
mately 10 times that area. sprawling
over some 60 acres of North Fulton
County countryside. Among other
things. its numerous amenities include
a large. rustic. lodge-style main building
that houses a constantly changing array
of plant. animal. and other nature-
oriented exhibits (primarily having to
do with wildlife indigenous to the Chat-
tahoochee River corridor in this part of
the state}. teaching facilities. adminis-
trative offices. and a complete nature
store chock full of field guides. bird
feeders. wildlife prints. books about nat-
ure. and other gifts.

The outside grounds include several
fresh water ponds. marked trails
throughout the river marsh and forested
areas. gardens containing a wide variety
of native wildflowers and plants. a bird
aviary built especially for injured hawks
and owls. bird feeding stations. and
much more. The entire Center is
designed so that each visitor will get a

firsthand look at some of the wonders i it
Mother Nature. Needless to say. the
grounds in and around the ("Zenter are

the next decade or so.

“Out stated purpose is to try to create
both an awareness and an appreciation
of our natural resources." says nat uralis:
Nanette Johnson. a nine-year veteran of
the Center. “\"Ve try to accomplish this
primarily through education. with a
heavy emphasis on teaching children.
Basically. our philosophy is simple. it
we can teach respect for the environ—
ment and a greater awareness of our nat-
ural resources to the thousands of

Three—legged fox has found a home at Chattahoochee Nature enter.

 

Of course, we also offer dozens of pro-
grams to adults as well as children.”

Since the Center’s beginning, Fulton
County has provided much of the fund-
ing for the purchase of property and for
the maintenance of the facility. How-
ever, all operating funds are raised
entirely by the Center itself. This is no
easy undertaking. Last year’s operating
budget tallied just under $500,000. Most
of this money is raised through private
donations, membership fees, profits
from the Center’s nature store, and an
assortment of special events, several of
which have grown to be much antici-
pated annual happenings by the local
community. For instance, the highly
popular 10-K “Possum Trot” road race is
held every june along the river, and
attracts some 1,500 runners.

“We try to promote ourselves as a
unique facility,” says Bob Taylor, Execu-
tive Director of the Nature Center.
“Nonetheless, we recognize the fact that
a lot of people don’t know what we’re all
about, and we’re taking measures to
change that image through a better pub-
lic relations effort.”

Taylor. a native of Leesburg, Florida,
took over the reins of the Center 1%
years ago. Formerly, he spent four years
as the director of a similar-type nature
center in Ft. Myers, Florida.

“There are three major misconcep-
tions about what we are and what we
do,” Taylor continues. “First of all, we
are not a government agency.

Many people consider us an agency
just like the National Park Service.

Instead. we’re a private, non-profit
organization, and we raise all our own
operating funds. (As just mentioned.
The CNC does lease their facility from

60

Fulton County, and Fulton County does
own and maintain the land, but the Cen-
ter is in no way affiliated with any
county government.)

“Secondly, we’re not a zoo. Occasion—
ally. we do take in injured or orphaned
animals, but we’re really not set up to do
this on a regular basis. What we are set
up to do is give out lots of information
about wildlife, and that’s exactly what
we attempt to do. And we always try to
emphasize that the less people
involved, the better. For example, if
someone finds a baby bird in their back
yard, we usually advise them to leave it
right where it is. The parent bird is prob-
ably close by, and in all likelihood, that
baby bird will be well taken care of. It’s
hard for people to do this, though. Most
of the time, people want to try to raise
that baby, and the baby dies. During the
spring, when most wildlife is born, it’s
not uncommon for us to receive 100 or
more telephone calls a day about
“orphaned” animals. We’re really not
staffed to handle this volume of calls,
but we always try to answer each one
and give out the best advice possible.

“We do keep a limited number of ani-
mals here that we use for educational
purposes, and once in a while, we take
in a injured hawk or owl. However, we
always try to rehabilitate these birds so
that they can be released into the wild.
By and large, most of the animals that
we keep here on a permanent basis are
injured in some way, and would not sur-
vive in the wild if set free. So we keep
them to use in our educational pro-
grams, especially for young people.

“The third misconception is, we don’t
rent raftsl”, Taylor says emphatically. “A
lot of people confuse us with the Chatta-

Dr. Robert Taylor with two friends.

 

hoochee Recreational Area, but we are
an independent organization altogether,
and we’re not in the raft business!”

Last year, nearly 30,000 school chil—
dren visited the Nature Center and par-
ticipated in various staff-conducted
programs. The majority of these chil-
dren come from Fulton and Cobb coun-
ties, but they also come from Gwinnett
County, Cherokee County, and other
surrounding areas. Total visitation to the
Nature Center by both children and
adults last year totaled well over
100,000 people.

Taylor reiterates what has already
been stated about the Center’s intended
purpose. “We want to do more than just
give out facts and figures to the children
who come here,” he says. “Sure, seeing
some of the live animals and exhibits is
important, but our real goal is to instill
some knowledge andappreciation for
the environment in these children while
they are still in their formative years.

With many adults, attitudes and
opinions have already been formed.
Whether right or wrong, these attitudes
are often very hard to change. But chil-
dren are more open-minded. Therefore.
we try to expose them to what the envi-
ronment is all about. Hopefully, they’ll
retain some of what they learn here from
now on. Then, when they get older,
they’ll have a greater knowledge about
some of the more positive aspects of
conversation, preservation, and other
environmental issues. We’re even offer-
ing special courses to school teachers
now during the summer, so that they can
teach some of these same principles and
concepts right in their own classrooms.

 




This helps to reinforce what we try to
teach here at the Nature Center.”

The Nature Center offers literally
dozens of interesting programs to both
adults and children of all ages. “Our cur—
rent membership total is up around
1,600 now, and we’re really trying to get
our members involved with what’s

going on,” says Nancy DuBose, the Cen- ,

ter’s Membership/Volunteer Coordina-
tor. “We have guided nature walks here
every Saturday and Sunday, we have
special programs every Sunday after-
noon at 3 pm. involving things like
making birdfeeders, wildflower identi—
fication, or wildlife photography (such
programs are announced well ahead of
time in the Nature Center’s bi—monthly
newsletter), we have bird-banding pro—
grams held here four times a month, we
have regularly scheduled canoe trips
out on the river, we have a number of
exciting field trips planned in the
months ahead, and we have lectures
and exhibits. In short, we have all kinds
of activities planned for the months
ahead, many of which are family ori-
ented, and we’re always looking for new
members.”

In order to carry out all of these
numerous and diverse programs suc-
cessfully, the Nature Center relies very
heavily on a volunteer staff composed of
some 150 individuals. “We couldn’t
open our doors without the dozens of
wonderful volunteers who help us out
in so many ways,” DuBose adds.

The Nature Center has already out—
grown its present facility. and for the
long term, an elaborate e:.~.;pansion plan
is under consideration. “Of course, this
will take a great deal of money,” Taylor
says. “We’ll probably have a major fund
raising drive several years down the
road.

“Right now, we’re looking at the most
important priorities. We’re asking the
question, what do we need first? For
instance, the building we’re in is very
crowded. We’d like to be able to improve
the working conditions for our staff. We
also want to increase our exhibit area, so
that we can offer more to the public.
Parking is another big concern. If we
attract more people, we’ve got to provide
additional parking areas. All of these

various aspects are being looked at right

now.”

Here are several of the major activities
being planned by the Nature Center for
the months ahead:

° In January, the Nature Center will
sponsor a month-long celebration titled
“A Whale of a Month” highlighting
whales off the coast of Georgia. There
will be a large “whale” exhibit or. dis-

egal snarls go to Canine

LA takes a new tack after being hounded by Court ,

By Paul Pringle

LOS ANGELES -- Every dog has
its day here —— in court,

And in the marbled chambers of
City Hall. And in a tiny Hollywood
Hills park where the children are
confined to a fenced playground so
that the canines can run free.

Los Angeles, whose licensed dog
population of 223,000 is the largest
in the nation, has become hounded
by the practical, prosecutorial and
political problems of pooches.

“L.A.’s very innovative when it
comes to dogs,” said Matthew Mar-
golis, owner of the National Insti-
tute of Dog Training in nearby Mon-
terey Park and consultant to Los
Angeles’ experimental Canine
Court. “People love their dogs here,
and they’re very progressive.”

In recent weeks, the city has
held its first two sessions of Canine
Court and enacted a landmark ordi—
nance that puts the bite on vicious
dogs and their owners. It‘also has
attempted to mediate a dispute be-
tween the self-described “dog peo-
ple” of Laurel Canyon Park —-
whose cause once was championed
by former Vice President Walter
Mondale —- and upscale Hollywood
Hills homeowners who advocate
strict enforcement of leash laws.

Left unresolved is an 'assault
case against a Los Angeles Raider
accused of attacking an animal con-
trol officer who had attempted to
cite the football player for walking
a dog without a leash. Defensive

back Otis McKinney faces a mis-
demeanor trial -— in human court
—-—next month.

“This is a new approach to at-
tacking the animal problem —— from
the behavior level rather than the
criminal level,” said Connie Seim,
chief hearing officer for Canine
Court, which convenes the first
Tuesday of each month in a dingy
West Los Angeles courtroom where
small claims are usually heard.

Canine Court was launched by
the Los Angeles city attorney’s off-
ice three months ago as a means of
keeping a backlog of complaints of
barking or unleashed dogs off the

criminal court calendar. It is a more '

 

l Dog therapy. 96A

 

formal version of a pilot project
that was given a nine-month run in
‘ E'e ,, i} Hills.

Last year, the city attorney’s off-
ice handled more than 1,200 com-
plaints of barking and runaway
dogs; about 120 of the cases went to
trial at an average cost to the city of
$35,000 each.

Animal control officers said the
large number of such complaints
reflects the shrinking amount of
open space in fast-growing Los An-
geles and a corresponding increase
in lifestyle conflicts between dog
owners and nonowners.

In Canine Court, the complain-
ing party and the dog owner argue
their cases before Seim and Mar-
golis in a forum resembling a pre-
trial hearing. The offending pet
must also appear in the courtroom.

which is equipped with a king-sized ..

water bowl during the dog sessions.

“We’ve had pee-pee problems,”
said Seim. “The dogs get nervous
just like people.”

'Dogs judged by Seim to be exces-
sive barkers or chronic runaways
are referred on the spot to Margolis,
”who walks the animals through a
course of “behavioral modifica-
tion.” In most cases, he said, this ac-
tually involves modifying the pet
owner’s behavior. .

The most common corrective
technique is to move dogs quartered
in the back yard into the house,
said Margolis, who gives the owners
simple lessons in housebreaking
their pets and making proper use of
a leash and collar.

All of the three dozen cases
heard so far in Canine Court have
been settled short of going to a full-
dress trial, Seim said. “This was an
excellent idea,” she said.

The city attorney’s office expects
to expand Canine Court to other
judicial districts throughout Los
Angeles early next year, said
Spokesman Mike Qualls.

pooch disputes

To curb more serious incidents
of canine misconduct, the City
Council has adopted what animal
control officers termed a pioneer’
ing ordinance that makes it easier
for authorities to impound and de-
stroy vicious dogs. There were
25,000 reports of dog bites in Los An-
geles last year.

The new law was enacted in Aug-
ust at the tail end of a furor over
attacks by pit bulls. Support for the
measure grew after a local televi-
sion station captured on tape the
mauling of an animal control offi-
cer by a SS-pound pit bull. The offi-
cer had gone to a residence to in-
vestigate complaints about the dog.

“We have people who are almost
held hostage in certain areas be-
cause of these dogs,” said Robert
Rush, general manager of the city’s
Animal Regulation Department.

The ordinance empowers animal
control and police officers to imme-

diately seize any dog that attacks,

bites or otherwise i

jures a person

{'W «another animal. If the dog is

‘ hearing, it canbe destroyed or have

sure in effect would banish the ani-
mal from the city.

In addition, the law imposes a
$500 fine and up to a year in jail on
dog owners found to be criminally
'f responsible for attacks by their
pets.

Pr’eviously, the Animal Regula-
. tion Department had to obtain a

’ The city will begin enforcing the
i, new ordinance next month. A simi-

. of Supervisors also goes into effect;

then.

Most animal rights groups, in-
cluding the Humane Society, have
endorsed the new ordinances be-

cause they provide for an appeal-

hearing. However, some of these or-
ganizations have , questioned
whether the laws make it too easy
to take an animal’s life.

“It should be difficult to kill a
dog,” said Jack Carone, acting presi-

dent of Last Chance for Animals,

 

 

president of the Laurel Hills Home-

owners Association and a propo-

nent of stepped-up enforcement of
the leash law. “Next thing I’m going
to have to do is get a license and
chain for my kid.”

Some of the dogs given free rein
on the four acres of grass and scrub
have belonged to celebrities, in-
cluding Mondale’s daughter, Elea-
nor. About two years ago, the for-
mer vice president and 1984 Demo-
cratic presidential nominee, at the
urging of his daughter, telephoned
Mayor Tom Bradley to lobby on be-
half of the dog people. Eleanor Mon-
dale has since moved from the area.

Greenfield continues to blame

‘ the inﬂuence of the Mondale family

for the City Council’s willingness to
accommodate the dog people. Last
week, a committee of the council ap-
proved what it touted as a compro-
mise that allows unleashed dogs to
roam the park from dawn to 9 am.
and from 4:30 pm. to dark. If
adopted by the full council, this ar-
rangement would make the park
the only one in the city where dogs

. may legally be untethered.

Not everyone was pleased with

Walter Mondale . . . once
championed the cause of
the “dog people” of Laurel
Canyon Park.

“dumb,“ and one dog person, 22-
year—old Brad Sackin, the owner of
an Australian shepherd mix, be-
moaned it as “terrible and com-
pletely unfair.”

“There are a lot more dogs that
come here than kids,” Sackin said.

Other dog people, while welcom-
ing the council’s action, down-
played suggestions that they or the
Mondales had the clout to make
City Hall roll over.

Said Jim Thompson, a retiree
who was spending the afternoon
walking a pair of Boston terriers
through a stand of butter-leaf trees
at the park: “We dog people don’t
have that much political power.”

Paul Pringle is chief of the Los'
Angeles bureau of Copley News Ser-

which is based in the San Fernando
Valley suburb of Tarzana. “You ,

, ’uld still have to get a court or-
deli?”

The dog dispute at Laurel Can-
yon Park is not serious enough to
be covered by the new ordinances
and is too complex for Canine
Court. For nearly four years, home-
owners in the area have com-
plained that the city’s leash law is
ﬂouted by dog owners who bring
their pets to the park for a run.

City Hall’s tacit approval of the
use of the park as a dog exercise ’
yard was evident in the city’s instal-
lation of a chain-link fence around
a small playground there. The fence
keeps the dogs away from the chili
dren, or vice versa.

“This park is the only park you
will ever see where the kids are

tfenced in,” said Jerry Greenfield,

the plan. Greenfield called it vice.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE

Anti-Cruelty reply

CHICAGO—I would like to
respond to Mr. Wichman’s letter
of Nov. 5 regarding the Anti—
Cruelty Society. It is only fair to
present our side of the situation
‘. because it disagrees with Mr.
Wichman’s statements.

Mr. Wichman came to the
shelter at 10:40 am. with the
body of his dead puppy (which
had been run over) and told the
receiving agent that he wanted
to get another one. He then
went to the front desk and
stated to the customer service
representative that his dog had
just died and he was ready to go
through the kennels. He was
told that the adoption room was
not open until noon.

Annoyed, Mr. Wichman left
but not without hearing from
the representative that since he
just lost his pet, shouldn’t be
wait and grieve or mourn before
adopting another pet? No, Mr.
Wichman stated, he wanted
another one today. Yes, our
policy does state that one must
wait before adopting another
animal and each case is handled
differently.

You may ask then, why didn’t
the customer service
representative tell Mr. Wichman
that he would be turned down
by the adoption counselor? Our
representatives are not allowed
to do this because a person
would then have the opportunity
to change his story during the
adoption counseling session.
Sessions are just that,
counseling.

We did not tell him that he
could never adopt an animal
from the society, only that he
needed to wait. If Mr. Wichman
was so desperate to have a dog
that day, I’m sure he has one
now. We only pity the poor
little pup who doesn’t realize
that he is just a replacement for
something that was broken,
crumbled, killed.

The Anti-Cruelty Society is
not a place for “disposal" but
for refuge. Our sole purpose is
not to “find homes for animals”
but to ﬁnd good, permanent
homes where animals will live
out their entire natural lives. For
this reason, many people are
turned down because they
cannot prove to us that they will
be responsible adopters.

Tragedy shows carelessness

On May 23, at 4:49 pm, a tragedy occurred on the northbound
1-94 freeway, just north of the Watertown exit.

A female duck lay injured in the road, with her mate standing by,
guarding her. He stood statue-like, watching her caringly, as it looking
for some answer to a question of deep feeling.

As cars would pass close, he would hop a foot or two from her
side, never taking his eyes from her, and instantly return. His world
of pain and sorrow was too big to see any other world around him.

One car passed close to her; her guardian was forced to take three
hops away. He turned to see if his lover was still there. That glimpse
of his mate was his last.

A woman driving a black Lincoln turned directly toward him and
in two black thumps the faithful guardian was dead; two broken lovers
lay three hops apart.

The woman in the Lincoln never flinched or changed expression
as her wheels bumped over feathers, flesh and bone. A tragedy of
horror and sadness had occurred and I think someone should know.

Dear Connie:

Thank you for your recent letter regarding the deforestation
of tropical rainforests.

Loss of tropical forests, either for agriculture or timber
products, has been an issue of concern for several years, and has
been the subject of legislation and numerous congressional
hearings. In the 99th Congress, amendments to the Foreign
Assistance Act contained language encouraging protection of
tropical rainforests —— through avoidance of tropical
deforestation -- in 0.5. bilateral aid programs. Some $2.5
million was earmarked in foreign aid to protect bioloc cal
diversity last year, an issue closely related to trop-‘al
deforestation, since the richest and most diverse habitat for
many unique species are found in tropical forests. Thus,
preservation of habitat by protecting tropical forests is a goal
of biological diversity efforts.

Currently, two bills, S. 1538 and H.R. 3010, would provide
protection to these forests by mobilizing efforts through the
World Bank and the International Monetary Fund linked to
structural adjustments and developing countries' debt. Much of
the language included in these bills has been incorporated, with
some changes, in this year's appropriations legislation. Also,
S. 1274, the International Security and Development Cooperation
Act of 1987, provides for increased funding, from $2.5 to $10
million, for biological diversity programs in the Agency for
International Development (AID).

Connie, it was good to hear from you.

Sincerely,

A\’\""‘\

Bear Necessities

It was with a mixture of
amusement and indignation
that I recently discovered
that the National Zoo’s polar
bears no longer inhabit their
magnificent home amid the
rocks and water.

It appears, according to a
placard overlooking the once
lively vista, that zoo officials
failed to realize that a south-
ern exposure in our sultry cli-
mate would be too hot for our
Arctic friends, who have been
farmed out to other zoos for
an indefinite period.

With disarming frankness,
the notice concludes with the
intention of these farsighted
administrators to construct a
tropical rain forest on the
abandoned site.

One can only hope that this
new plan is not an example of
what Dr. Johnson once re-
ferred to as "a disordered
imagination taking another

turn.”

Beavers need no encouragement to
work. These industrious little .
rodents spend much of their time
cutting wood, moving logs and
building dams. Breeding, however, is
another matter. So far only two
British zoos, Chessington and
Edinburgh, have managed to breed
beavers — but a new scheme, just
launched at Drusilla’s 200 Park in
East Sussex, may be successful.

The new beaver lodge at Drusilla’s
was completed at the end of last
year. Covering over 350 square
metres, this is the largest beaver
compound in the country and home
to Gnasher and Gnawer, two
Canadian beavers.

Boredom is a beaver’s worst '

enemy, so they need to be kept busy.

Unfortunately, the beaver’s desire
for work frequeme outweighs the
animal’s common sense. ‘Beavers
are not the most intelligent of
creatures,’ says Michael Ann, Zoo
Director. ‘They are workaholics. A
lot of the work they take on turns
out to be pretty pointless.’
Although Gnasher and Gnawer
don’t have the opportunity to fell

trees at Drusilla’s, the pair have
been provided with the next best
thing. Every evening, staff place
four-inch-thick willow branches in
the drainpipes that they have
mounted in the soil of the
compound. The beavers incisors
aren’t strong enough to chew
through the pipes, so they just lop
off the tops of the branches.

Gnasher and Gnawer wasted a lot
of time damming up a water-free
area at one end of their colony; they
seemed convinced that water from
the 200’s flamingo pond would make
the eight-foot journey across dry
land and ﬂood their own quarters. In
a moment of supreme stupidity, the
beavers also attempted to dam their
own water chute.

Staff at Drusilla’s are conﬁdent
that the pair will produce young.
‘T here’s no reason why beavers
shouldn’t breed over here,’ says
Michael. ‘Some zoos don’t
encourage them because they don’t
think they are exotic enough.’

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - March 10, 1987

 

By Robert Enstad

A while back, the Illinois Depart-
ment of Conservation was part of a
great “goose exchange”: Kansas re-
ceived 217 giant Canada geese from
Illinois in exchange for some prairie
chickens.

A 1986 department memo indi-
cates that Illinois never got the prai-
n'e chickens, but no one in Spn'ng-
ﬁeld appears to be upset, perhaps
because many Illinoisans are be-
coming annoyed with the geese.

Noisy giant Canada “honkers”
are settling in large numbers all
across the state, becoming pests in-
stead of objects of wonder and
amusement.

Dr. George Burger, manager of
the Max McGraw Wildlife Founda-
tion in Dundee, estimates that
10,000 to 15,000 Canada geese
have taken up permanent residence
in the Chicago area, mostly in re-

1 cent years.

“Their numbers are increasing
enormously,” Burger said, “and
they are becoming a nuisance be-
cause they are becoming too nu—
merous. The geese are doing too
well around here” because they
have found suitable habitats in and
around pools and lakes built as re-
tention ponds in suburban office
and residential complexes, as well as
in forest preserves.

“They’ re always fun at fiist,” said
Norrell Wallace, manager of the
Crab Orchard National Wildlife
Refuge near Carbondale. “Often it
starts off as a communit project.
People say, ‘Wouldn’ t it nice if

'we had a couple of geese in the city

reservoir?’ ” _
Yeais ago, the big birds were seen

1 ﬂying over Illinois towns twice a

year in V- shaped formations,

' headed north or south and herald-

ing a change of seasons. It is esti-
mated that close to a half-million

geese still migrate each year be-

tween nesting grounds along James
Bay in Canada and wintering
grounds at Crab Orchard and other
areas in Kentucky, Tennessee and
Arkansas.

This year the geese left Crab Or-
chard and headed for Canada about
a month early, largely because of
the mild weather, Wallace said.
Some of the geese may never retum'
to Canada, choosing instead to
drop out of the migration and join
the growing year-round ﬂocks in II-
inois.

Ornithologists, naturalists and

others who chronicle the Canada
goose give a number of reasons for

the changing habits of the birds, .

which weigh up to 15 pounds and
have wingspans of 4 to 5 feet. Dar-
rell Haugen, assistant manager of
the Horicon National Wildlife Ref-
uge .in Horicon, Wis.", believes
weather is the biggest factor.
Thousands of birds never moved
south this winter from their fall

‘ stopover- at Hon'con because of the

warm winter and lack of snow,
Haugen said. “From what I hear,
they were short of birds down
South this year, ’he said.

The geese moving into the Chica-
go area and reproducing are those
known as the giant Canada goose,
Branta canadiensis maxima, a sub‘

 

species of the Canada goose, 'which
is smaller. Daniel Brouillard, super-
visor of conservation for the Lake
County Forest Preserve District,
said the giant goose was once very
common in northern Illinois but al-
most became extinct after vast
wetland areas were converted to
farmland a century ago.

The Canada goose mates for life
and can live as long as 10 to '15

years. The geese build their nests on .

the ground. A female can be expect-
ed to lay three or four eggs a year.
The goslings’ chance of survival is

' better than 90 percent because the

gander will brood over the young.
This has meant a population
boom for the geese, which can be
found in large ﬂocks in forest pre—
serves in the Chicago area, around
small lakes and ponds and, among
other places, on the grounds of the

’Chicago Botanic Garden in Glen-
coe, the Morton Arboretum in’

Lisle, the Fermi National laborato-
ry in Batavia. On Wednesday
morning, 125 Canada geese were

counted at the Botanic Garden..

Some days there are many more,
said Kn's Jarantoski, assistant direc-
tor of the gardens.

The Botanic Garden, like so .

many other areas, has felt the im-
pact of the big birds’ hearty appetit~

“During the summer they go

“Sometimes they never leave. The

hunters in s1x days in nine northeast

Department of Conservation per-

geese around the state to less popu-

Kansas for the prain'e chickens and
with Missouri, Arkansas and Ken-

But the swaps are becoming hard
to make. “We’re running out of the

“Other states don’t want them.”

Animal hearts for humans Seen

By Jon Van
Chicago Trlbune

NEW ORLEANS—Surgeons
will be implanting animal hearts in
patients before fully implantable
artiﬁcial hearts become a reality,
the’world’s leading pioneer in
heart transplantation predicted
Monday.

Dr. Norman Shumway, chair-
man of cardiovascular surgery at
Stanford University, said he ex-
pects that within a decade re-
searchers will discover how to alter
the human immune system so that

it won’t recognize transplanted or-

gans and reject them.

“I’m convinced that we will See

the induction of speciﬁc toleran-
ce,” said Shumway. “There are so
many people working on this, to
ﬁnd a way to masquerade the
transplant, in a speciﬁc manner so
that the recipient doesn’t detect
that this is non-self.”

Such a discovery would be a
boon to transplantation of human

hearts, but the supply, of donor ' . . . .
. which animal specres might make

hearts falls far short of the need,
Shumway said.

Controlling the immune reject-
ion problem is the first step
toward use of animal organs for
transplants, but other research
breakthroughs will also be neces-
sary, he said. . .

For one thing, it isn’t clear what
species of animal might be used
for cross-species transplantation, a
procedure known as a xenograft.
Nonhuman primates, such as ba-
boons, are not plentiful enough.

“There are only 500
chimpanzees in the United
States,” Shumway said. “It can’t
.come from sub-human primates,
so when we talk about xenografts
on a practical basis we have to
talk about some species that is
much more disparate from man

than the primate, and that is Why
it is gomg to be a slow process.”

. Shumway declined to speculate

the best source of hearts for
humans, but some other experts
have mentioned pi s as likely can-
didates because 0 their size and
general similarity to human anato-
mY~ .
Despite the obstacles that must

‘ be overcome before animal hearts

are used in humans, Shumway
said he expects cross—species trans-
plants will be used before full im-
plantable permanent arti icial
hearts with self-contained power
sources are available.

Shumway, who delivered the
opening lecture at the American
College of Cardiology annual
meeting in New Orleans, made his
remarks at a press conference fol-
lowing the lecture.

Doctors at more than 100 US.

high, he said. Many surgical teams

Beavers Build a Problem for Road Planners

“Wetlands Issue Proves to Be Slippery for Springfield 3372a“, ~ Other Highway Projects _

 

By John Lancaster

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

In their quest. for better roads,
highway engineers have grown ac‘
customed to environmental battles.
But rarely have they had-to match
wits with a beaver colony.

When it surfaced last fall that the
environmental study on the pro-
posed Springfield Bypass had over-
looked wetlands in its path, Virginia
transportation officials discovered

that nature had played them a trick. .

They found a five-acre pond near

Herndon that had not been there
when the study was completed in
1983. 3 -
Transportation officials blame
the industrious rodents known as
nature’s engineers. ’ '
“What can you do?” asked Duke
Whedbee, an ecologist with the Vira.

ginia Department of Transporta»

tion. “Is a beaver pond a temporary
wetland or a permanent one?"
Throughout the region, highway
' officials are confronting similar
questions as they struggle to bal-
ance the need for new roads with
the desire to protectisuch vital nat-
ural resources as wetlands, which,
serve as a refuge for. untold num-
’ bers of fish and wildlife spec1es. ‘
“Wetlands stuff is driving us crav.
zy," said Harter Rupert,.chief of the
Federal Highway Administration s
project development branch.

“This kind of concern . . . has,

certainly heightened in the last few
years,” he said. ‘

: I Last October, the federal govern-

: mént reversed itself and ordered an
environmental study for the Lock-

posed highway that would provide a

direct connection between Rte. 1- '

;and the Springfield Mall area of
3 Fairfax County. The two-mile road
would cut through Huntley Mead-

ows Park, where environmental:

officials said it could damage wet-
lands.

_I This month, the Sierra Club and “

three other groups temporarily
blocked the Maryland highway de-

partment from proceeding with
plans to widen 16 miles of 1-270 ’
‘. from the Capital Beltway into

 

»'n'orthern . Montgomery County.
Among other objections, the envi-
ronmentalists said the widening
would consume 10‘ acres of wet-
lands. '

I Environmentalists are protesting ‘

Maryland’s plans to build the so-

called Inter-County Connector, a'

15-mile route between [-270 near
Gaithersburg and the Baltimore-

Washington Parkway in Greenbelt. “

They contend that the proposed
road would ruin the Washington
area’s only freshwater stream in
which trout live and reproduce nat-
urally. '
None of the voiced concerns nec-
. essarily means that the roads will
' dot eventually be built.
‘3'. Highway departments routinely

secure permission to build over ‘

wetland areas, provided that they

_ take steps to lessen the impact.

if Officials say they are confident
that they will be able to satisfy con-
cerns about the proposed Spring-
field Bypass.

EBut they worry that additional
environmental studies could delay
that and other much-needed pro-

In.

ma

'antihighway lawsuits.“ could

turn wetlands into majur impedi- -

ﬁents, much as the Hudson River’s

striped bass proved fatal £5 New
York’s $2 billion Westway project in
1985.

In private, highway officials ex- ‘

press exasperation with environ-
mental regulators. -
“There’s a lot of posturing by

federal agencies,” said a Virginia

transportation official involved in
the Springfield Bypass project.
“Anyone knows the wetlands out

there are not the prime wetlands in g

the United States.”

One complicating factor is the
changing definition of wetlands,
which has broadened substantially
in recent years. Highways can take
decades to move off the drawing

- boards.

As a result, highway officials
say, long-term projects are en-

countering environmental obsta?

cles that did not exist when they
weredesisned.-. .. ._.

In Maryland, said state Planning
Director Neil Pedersen, “We’re re- ;
viewing all our projects to make i
sure that none have been over-
looked." ~

But few would dispute that wet
lands are a valuable resource. They
include a range of delicate ecosys-
them saltwater

Wetlands in the United States; I,
have diminished by more than half

‘ in the past few centuries, from 215

million acres to less than 99 million,
according to Alan Wentz, a wildlife ,
biologist with the National Wildlife |

Federation. .
“It sets up kind of an interesting

.' dilemma,” Wentz said. “If you're in ,

the middle of an urban area, people
will say, “It’s just a swamp." But in

Also, environmentalists cite the
role wetlands play in controlling
ﬂoods and filtering out water pol-
lution.

Last year, for example, the Na-
tional Wildlife Federation gave an
award to an Amoco refinery in
North Dakota that created a “nat-
ural” marsh to treat effluents from
the plant.

The federal government has not
always been concerned with wet-
lands. Until recently,.according to
the federation, government subsi-
dies rewarded farmers who drained
wetlands to grow crops.

But heightened environmental
awareness brought changes that
culminated in the passage of the

- 1972 Clean Water Act, which es-
tablished a permit system for pro-
jects that claimed wetlands. -

K 1977 executive order by Pres- ‘1
ident Carter required federal agen-
cies to preserve wetlands wherever
possible. '

Federal and state highway offi-
cials are struggling with that legacy '
as they seek to build the $250 mil- ‘
lion Springfield Bypass, which
would traverse Fairfax County be-
tween Rte. 7 in the northwest and f.
Rte. 1 in the southeast on a route

 

roughly parallel to the Capital Belt- 3
way.
A private consulting firm stud-
ied the environmental impact of
the road as part of a $1.9 million
preliminary engineering contract.
Completed in 1983, the environ-

mental impact statement con-
cluded that no» wetlands would be
affected.

But the Us. Fish and Wildlife
Service examined the road plans
last summer and came to a different
conclusion.

Environmental officials identified
about 20 acres of wetlands that
would be affected, including the
beaver pond, two forested wetland
areas and a number of small
streams. ’

They directed the state to pre-
pare a “supplemental environmental
document” addressing the wetlands
in the path of the road. '

Transportation officials agree
that significant wetlands were over-
looked but insist that the beaVer 2;.

The Army Corps of Engineers,
which is responsible for granting
permits to build roads through wet-
land areas, will make the final de-

' cision about whether the road can.
be built. .

In the meantime, transportation
officials have reluctantly concluded
that the beaver pond is a wetland,
subject to the same protections as
any other. ' .'

  State willpay farmers
: who lose stock to coyotes

By Ace Elliott

STAFF WRITER

Farmers who suffer livestock losses
from Ohio’s growing coyote population

~ . will be able to apply for financial relief as

the result of a law that went into'effect
Sunday. . _

In effect, it’s the first time Ohio has
conceded that the coyote, while not a na-
tive of the state, has migrated from the
west in appreciable numbers. ' ‘

Tom Brown of Troy, president of the
Ohio Sheep Improvement Association,
said the state’s coyote problem “is be-
coming more serious all the time” and
that sheep raisers are not the only ones
who should be concerned. Hunters also
may have their sport affected by the wily
predator. ' ,.

Coyotes prey on ‘fawns, rabbits and
quail, as well as other small game, Brown
said. “That’s one of the first signs that
coyotes are around and we’re beginning
to see this already.” .

The sheep association and the Ohio
Farm Bureau successfully lobbied for the
November passage of Ohio House Bill
848, the coyote-indemnity program.

The new law puts responsibility for
coyote damage into the hands of the Ohio
Department of Agriculture. directing it to
set up a fund to pay farmers for livestock
‘ killed by coyotes. The Division of Wild-
' life of the state’s Department of Natural
‘ Resources is given the authority to devel-
' op county control programs.

, lf -‘ county dog wardens substantiate
' that wandering dogs have killed live-

? ' Because coyotes,

stock, then county commissioners can au-
thorize payment of damages from the
dog and kennel fund, for which part of
dog license fees are set aside.

which reference
books describe as small wolves, are shy

.of humans and hunt at night, many times

not even the farmers whose sheep are
killed by them have spotted the enemy.

“They can be all around you and you
don’t even know they’re there,” said Don
K. Miller, an eastern Logan County sheep
raiser.

Miller is certain coyotes are roaming
his 1,000-acre farm because his son, Tim,
recently made a tape-recording of four to
six animals making their distinctive
nighttime chorus of mournful howling
interspersed with whines, yaps and
barks.

A Montgomery County tamer, Jack
Judy of near Germantown, shares
Miller’s worries, although his sheep flock
hasn’t been invaded either.

“We’ve seen coyotes twice and they’ve
been caught in traps around here,” he
said. .

While farmers in the Miami Valley
have yet to be hurt significantly by the
coyote, Rick Moore, a sheep raiser in the
rugged strip-mining country of Harrison
County, in eastern Ohio, figures he has
lost $15,000 to $20,000 worth of sheep
from coyote kills, and as many as 65
sheep in one year.

Coyotes can be hunted year-round, ex-
cept during deer season, and that includes
the Sunday. -

How to file claim

 

Here is a brief general de- '
scription of the steps farmers
must take to ﬁle a claim with
the Department of Agriculture
when coyotes are believed to
have killed their livestock:

I THE COUNTY dog war-

den should be notiﬁed of the kill
within three days. If the dog
warden believes the kill was made
by a coyote, then the warden

will notify the county game protec-
tor who will investigate.

I IF THE GAME protector
believes the kill was, or might
have been, made by coyotes,

the farmer will ﬁle a claim with the
Department of Agriculture.

I IF THE KILL method indi-

 

cates the animal was not killed by
a coyote, the game protector

can refer the case back to the dog
warden.

I IF THERE is a disagree-
ment between the ﬁndings of the
dog warden and the game pro-
tector, the farmer can appeal to
the Department of Agriculture
fora ﬁnal ruling.

I IF A FARMER disagrees
with an assessment of damages,
the farmer must provide two
witnesses to establish a fair mar.
ket value.

I IF AN ANIMAL killed by
coyotes is covered by insurance,
the Agriculture Department's
indemnity fund will pay only the
deductible amount.

.. Protect Pets And People

Leash laws are something
that usually aren’t taken too
.seriously. '

i But, maybe the Haywood
.Turnipseed case last week
made all of us think again.

While no one eyer expects a
pet to maul -- and certainly not
kill — anyone, now is a good
time to remind pet owners that
DeKalb does have a law con-
cerning domesticated animals.

. Actually, the law is very
Simple. It states that animals
are not allowed to “run at
large.” That means they must
be made to stay in their own

yards, or be under leash or
vorce control.

As Ann Reiner of the De-
Kalb Humane Society reminds
us, pets “do not need absolute
freedom to amuse themselves
as they please at your neigh-
bors’ houses.”

“Unfortunately,” she said,
“to say that a pet has a right to
be free is to say that he has the
right to be a potential public
nuisance, to become sick, in-
jured, or lost, or possibly to be
killed. You must make the de-
cision for your pet.

From Spain to New York, concern grows over the role of animals in

 

’the worlds of entertainment and research

I'

t

i

J

‘ Spain.

RSPCA ‘ barbarism ’. plea ;

Protest over
-_ Aids teSts
on chimps

by KEVIN TOOLIS '

CRUELTY to animals is a
common feature of Spanish

fiestas. ‘ Blood fairs,’ as they are '
known to animal lovers, have a 5
history in Spanish culture ’

dating back to medieval times,
writes David Adams.

One British expert. Barrie Tra- .1,
eey, returned last week from Spain .g
where, for the past five years, he has ‘

been studying the festival traditions
tnvolvmg barbaric cruelty to
animals.

His curiosity was first aroused in

1982 when he witnessed the stoning
of small animals tied to stakes—
including rabbits, doves, chicken
and ducks—at the February fiesta
of Los Llanos de la Cruz in Southern

In 1985 the Governorof Malaga
issued a proclamation banning the
stoning but it took the presence of
the Guardia Civil at last year’s
festival and the threat of heavy fines

g-before local people reluctantly

accepted the ruling.

Mr 'Iracey has now compiled a

list of cruelties taking place. at some

507 fiestas where barbaric acts on
animals are a major attraction. In ,
one village, a goose is' strung up _

across the village square - and
horsemen compete to pull its head
off. In another, chickens and
turkeys are clubbed, to death by
blindfolded men.

In the villages of Ciruelas and
Cifuentes in the Guadalajara region,

calves are pursued across country '

by tractors until they are crushed to
death, Mr Tracey claimed.

At Igea in La ‘ Rioja every
November young calves are thrown
from a platform which is gradually
raised until the animal dies.
Elsewhere; balls of fire are attached
to bull’s horns and they are made to
run in fear until they drop dead.

‘ Wherever there are cruel fiestas
the various local and international
animal welfare groups do their best
to draw attention to it. But it’s
impossible to monitor all these
places,’ said Mr Tracey.

Tracey believes the Spanish
Government is seriously trying to
tackle the problem. ‘ But the
Government is very aware how
sensitive the people are about it,’ he
said.

Cruelty to animals is not restric-
ted to Spanish fiestas . In the United

Kingdom and Ireland, the RSPCA

»_ has been concerned about hare-

coursing for many years and dog-
fighting occurs across Europe,
especially in Malta. '
The RSPCA-backed Overseas
Fund has publicised the plight of
chimpanzees, tigers and lion cubs
which are drugged by beach photo-
graphers in Spain and the Canary
Islands to pose for tourist snaps.
It has also protested over the
methods used in the slaughter of
frogs, cats and dogs, for human

consumption.

As The Observer has highlighted
recently, the RSPCA is also concer-
ned about the conditions in which
sheep are transported long dis—

' tances in Europe.

ITHE USE of animals in
. bizarre spectator sports is
not restricted to Spain. An
attraction in New York is
‘diving mules,’ (above)
gwhere the animals are
gmade to plunge off high
ispringboards into water.
i When perched at the top
got the narrow—sided diving
iboards, the mules throw
Ethemselves off rather than
gturn back.
Their owners claim the
ianimals‘ are perfectly
' happy and jump enthusias-
itically each time.

’ Research will

GOVERNMENT scientists
will be seeking around 30
chimpanzees to inject with
the Aids virus if plans to set
up a new research laborat-
or-y at Porton Down in

_ Wiltshire get the go-ahead.

The only other Aids laborato-
ries using primates are in the
United States. The labs require
stringent security to safeguard
staff and the public from the
Aids—infected chimpanzees,

. which are housed in special

metal and glass-walled cages

, connected to independent air

systems.
‘At this point chimpanzees

are the only model available to

do human Aids virus vaccine

Dr Jorg Eichberg. head of Aids
research at the South-West
Foundation for Biomedical
Research in Texas. which has

'172 chimps in its research

programme.

‘Once you get to the nitty
gritty. essential questions like
the efficacy and efficiency of

Porton Down is the Only

1 British research centre with

suitable isolation facilities and
experience of working with
rare and dangerous viruses. It
is understood that some of the
£20 million being sought by the
Medical Council for Aids
be used to
establish the proposed chim-
panzee Aids vaccine pro-
gramme at Porton’s Centre for
Applied Microbiology and
Research.

Britain’s leading Aids
researchers are currently using
American laboratories. ‘ We
are now at the stage where
testing in chimpanzees is
important.’ said Dr Ruth Jar-
rett, a Glasgow University

. scientist associated with the US

National Cancer Institute. ‘In
the area of vaccine research a lot
of vaccines that have been
experimentally developed have
to be tested. It would be nice if
we could innoculate animals

 

 

somewhere in Britain.’

But the validity of the
proposed chimpanzee tests has
been questioned by other

scientists Although chimpan-
zees become infected with the
Aids virus they do not develop
the disease itself. Nor has any

: chimpanzee died of Aids

Predictably, animal rights
groups object to the conditions
in which the research chimpan-
zees are held. American animal
protesters who broke into
SEMA Corporation’s Maryland
Aids primate centre last winter
claim the 30 infected chimps
were suffering from sensory
deprivation .

‘The chimps were kept in
solitary confinement and
isolated from each other said
the British Union for the
Aboltion of Vivisection’s scien-

; tific adviser Dr Robert Sharpe.
' Four baby chimps worth over

£0,000 each were stolen by the
raiders.
Dr Eichberg reluctantly acc-
epts that isolating intelligent
primates like chimps is a
necessary evil to save human
lives. ‘It is true that you
t deprive these animals by mam—
: taining them in the cage for an
‘ extended period. But they have

 




A to donate that time for research
and after that they can 11ve a
normal life.’

Scientists angry

Like their US colleagues.
British scientists are angry
about claims of cruelty or ill-
treatment in work they regard
as vital to producing a vaccine.
‘It is absolutely shocking.’ said
Dr larrett. ‘We have one of the

world s gravest health pro- .

blems and people still object to
research involving animals. In
some areas laboratory work is
enough for a breakthrough but
in other areas particularly
vaccines. we do require animals
to develop safe and efficacious
drugs.

protesters are willing to see

drugs tested straight on humans ,

but I would rather see drugs
tested on another animal spe-
cies before widescale human
usage.‘

The worldwide scarcity of
legally-obtained chimpanzees
will also be a major obstacle for
British researchers; Britain’s
current stock of 2610, mainly
held in zoos. is not enough for
experimentation and breeding
programmes. Fresh stock
would be required from Central
Africa.

Donkey village in

; BEING FINGERED as the

Miguel, proprietor of the
village bar. ‘Next the big
softies in Madrid will be

' arresting Don Quixote for

letting Sancho Panza ride one,’
he says to applause from the
assembled company.

Burro ’ has become a dirty
word in Villanueva de la Vera,
a mountain village in the
western province of Céceres
Next week they celebrate the
ancient festival of Pero Palo
which brings flocks of tourists

, from Britain and the rest of
‘ Europe to this remote spot.

Tempers are running high
here, however, because a
tradition which has become a
source of income appears
ieopardised by the animal
protection lobby.

In a full-page advertisement

in national newspapers, the
Animal Rights Defence Ass--

ociation condemned the people
of Villaneuva de la Vera for
their inhumanity

. The claim is that during the

festival of Pero Palo, a fat man
rides the oldest donkey in the
village until it literally drops
beneath him. The village
children jump on board for
good measure to ensure the
beast has absolutely no chance
of survival.

course it is a very, very infirm

donkey and then it would be a

terrible accident. We never kill

donkeys deliberately,’ he says

with some bravado

The village’s attitude to the
animal rights campaigners is
simple and proudly dismissive.
San Miguel’s son. IoSe. points
to his forehead and mutters.

'Loco’

In Madrid, Jorge Roos of the
Animal Rights Defence Ass—
ociation, is used to being
regarded as a lunatic bysome
of his compatriats. Sympathy
for animal rights campaigners
is limited in the land of the
bullfighter

He explains that each year
the association chooses a
specific target in its drive to
alert Spaniards to the issue of
animal cruelty.

‘Last year we highlighted
the brutality in Corria where a
bull is killed by the populace
who blow darts at it until it
bleeds to death. While it still
lives its testicles are cut off as
a trophy. It is a disgusting
display of misplaced mach-
ismo,’ he said.

Roos does not believe the
disclaimers by the villagers of
Villanueva de la Vera. He is
certain that the donkey does
die and that it is part of a ritual
re-enactment of Christ’s ride
to Jerusalem.

‘ Spain IS a country where the
poor people have been domi-
nated for so long that they have
a very deep need to dominate
someone or something else
themselves. Often it is the
animals—bulls and donkeys—-
which end up as our victims,’

e said.

.He says the association is
campaigning against the glorif-
ication of cruel Spanish

traditions. It fears that brutal-

ity towards animals is being
sold to tourists as part of
Spain’s cultural heritage.

‘In the North, there is a
festival where they string a
goose upside down across a
river and the young men row
out and try and break its neck
by hanging from it. How can
this be a tourist spectacle? It
is a nightmare.’

We are very good to our
burros‘ says the woman. She
quotes a local proverb which,
roughly translated, says 40
pairs of shoes are still not
enough to outwear the hooves
of a hardworking donkey.

Already in the village, this
year’s crop of hire cars from
Madrid is beginning to appear.
Tourists may exclaim over the
quaintness of the village streets
and the people’s customs. But
they will soon be able to judge
whether Jorge R005 and the
animal right protesters are
tilting at windmills or not. ‘
I The RSPCA yesterday asked
Spain to ban the donkey
crushing at Villanueva de la
Vera.

The RSPCA said it would
seek legislation through the
European Parliament if the
Spanish Government refuses to
act. The RSPCA is also
protesting to the Spanish

Tourist Board and Euro-MP3. ‘

Austln infant undergoes surgery

after belng mauled by Bengal tiger

By Ken Herman
AssociatedPress ;. " 1 .

. AUSTIN —— A 5-month-old boy
‘- Was injured Friday by a lZO-pound
tiger that was illegally taken to his
home by a family friend, authori-
ties said. 7

Kylie Dudley underwent recon-
structive surgery on his face and
right ear at Breckenridge Hospi-
tal said hospital spokeswoman
Marsha Walker. -

The attack occurred Friday

. morning while the baby was in his -

mother's arms, said Kellye Norris,

spokeswoman for the Austin Po-v

lice Department.

The 8month-old female Bengal

, tiger was impounded. by city offi-

cials at the Humane Society shel-

ter, where it will be held for 10

days to check for rabies, said Su-

\ .san Halberstadt, spokeswoman for
the Humane Society.

‘ Ms. Halberstadt said city ordi-

names by: wild mime-Jame ..

tigers within the city. The tiger’ s

owner, Patricia Dandurant, lives

'in Creedmoor, a small town south-

east of Austin

She took the animal Thursday

night to the Austin home of Linda

Dudley, the injured boy’ s mother,
- ~ said Ms. Norris. ‘

The tiger'was Scheduled to see.
“a veterinarian Friday to be. de-
. clawed and to have its teeth

capped, the police spokeswoman

said.
The animal was tied to a living

room door when the incident took

place, Ms. Norris said.

“The mother was holding Kylle
in (her) arms. She got up and sort
of bent over to change the TV
channel. The tiger swatted her
arm and knocked the baby out of
her arms,” Ms. Norris said.

Ms. Dudley suffered minor

cuts, the police spokeswoman said.

. Two otherwomen in the house
pulled the tiger away from the
._ baby. A mallet the house took the

. Child to the hospital

Ms Walker, the hospital spokes-
woman, said the child probably

' would require further surgery.

“The baby has serious cuts,”
she said, adding that the most se-
rious wounds apparently were

.cau'sed by the tiger’s claws,

though there might have been
some bite wounds.
Bruce Truitt, public informa-

tion officer for the Austin and
. Travis County Health Department,

said his agency took the tiger to
the Humane Society shelter.

“It was definitely irascible,” he
said of the animal’s demeanor dur-
ing the transfer.’

Truitt said having the tiger in
the city limits was a “clear-cut vio-
lation”- of city ordinances.

Ms. Norris said there probably
would be no criminal charges
filed in connection with the inci-

dent, but' she said the tiger’s»

owner could face a fine for bring-
ing the animal into the city.

Dogs the casuali

By RICHARD STEWART

NEWTON -— When Pete Stark and son-in-law
Larry Ford realized their pack of eight musically
haying hounds was heading toward land owned by
Claude and James Williams, they feared they were
heading toward trouble.

They were right.

. ' Now one of the dogs is dead, three more are miss-

, scars of the day the hunter dogs became the hunted.

Claude Williams, 77, and his 43-year-old son, James,
arelseach charged with five counts of cruelty to ani-
ma . ‘
. Their case is in the center of a continuing conflict
between thosegtwho liketo use dogs to hunt deer and

landowners who oppose it. How heated the disagree-
ment can get is evidenced by the side of the Williams
i" family’s log-cabin office: Somebody has used a blow- ,
torch to char into the wood the accusation, “Dog
"‘ Killer.” ’
“A lot of pe0ple are congratulating me and support-

i ing me and telling me that they would have done the
same thing,” the younger Williams’Said. “The ironic .
thing about it is that we didn’t shoot the dogs. I don’t '

Voters overwhelmingly ap-

Moore approached Commission-
er Haven Poe about the issue. Poe
asked Animal Control Director Dan
Gorman to check with the county’s
legal staff.

Gorman, however,
doesn’t see any problem.

“We’re trying to be reasonable
about this,” he said Friday. “To the
best of my knowledge, USF has nev-
er asked for any wild animals and I
don’t think they’d ever ask for any-
thing like that.”

Animal Control picks up about
1,000 wild animals a year, mostly
opossum and raccoons trapped by
homeowners, Gorman said. The ani-
mals are released back into the
wild.

“‘If I get a mouse, they don’t

Dr. Lewis Nelson of USF’s medi-

cal school said the chances of USF

asking Animal Control for a wild an-

: imal is one in a million. .
“Let’s say we need an opossum

for research tomorrow,” he said.
“Will Animal Control have one to-
morrow? We can’t take that chance.
if we need one tomorrow we need
one tomorrow."

USF has a‘ supplier for oposSums

and raccoons, Nelson said. He
doesn’t know ”what kind of animals

‘Animal Control picks up.

“We don’t have the slightest idea
what they receive there,” he said.
“We would not consider that as a
source for these animals.”

Moore, however, isn’t satisfied.

. “Everyone has just assumed
we’re talking about dogs and cats,”
he said. “But an animal is any living

creature that can be distinguished

Dear Madame President:

Congratulations on your victory in the Philippines.
May you prove to be a thoughtful and caring president
for your terms of office.

This letter is a request that exports of monkeys,
birds, and other wildlife be banned; that export of
logs be banned to protect the forests of the Philli-
pines which are home to the nation's wildlife.

we read constantly of how our forests are vanishing
at a deplorable rate around the world, and how this
is not only decimating our wildlife, but we do not
kDW'hDW this is going to affect humans as well.

‘we must stop this destruction of our forests about
which we still know very little. Man is continuing
to learn every day about how valuable our forests are.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Kick It toy upsets SPCA ofﬁcial

By Bill Strobel

Knight-Ridder Newspapers

SAN FRANCISCO -—- Toymaker
Mike Murphy thinks it's OK to ex-
press your anger by kicking a
stuffed dog. Animal welfare advo-
cate Richard Avanzino thinks it’s
outrageous.

Murphy is the 29-year-old inven-
tor of KickDog, a black-and-white
toy that looks like a combination
fox terrier and pit bull - with a
crooked grin.

KickDog isn’t designed to be
petted. It’s designed to be propelled
with shoe leather. ,

Avanzino, president of the San
Francisco Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, said the
idea of kicking a pooch -- even a
stuffed one -—- is “ghastly.” Only
“people who enjoy perverted plea-
sures” would find it amusing, he
said.

At any rate, KickDog was a hit at
the recent San Francisco Gift Show.

Murphy, who operates out of La-
guna Hills in Southern California,
said his company certainly isn’t ad-

vocating giving a pointed toe to the '

family pooch.

Just the opposite in fact, he said.
The idea is to allow people so in-
clined to take their frustrations out
on an inanimate object rather than
on animals.

The toy, Murphy said, is the re-

sult of “an idea I’ve been kicking
around for three years.”

He said he got his inspiration
from his former bosses at an ac-
counting firm in Los Angeles,
where he was employed before he
went into business for himself.

To friends at the firm, he said, he
was known as “Murphdog,” which
his employers thought was rather
undignified for a certified public
accountant.

“There was a lot of high stress on
the job and I had to deal with a mul-
tilevel boss structure,” he said.
“One day when one of them told me
the firm didn’t like the image I was
projecting, I told them to find some
other dog to kick around, and I
quit.” >

Murphy’s sister, Sue Gustavson,
a graphic artist, made the model of
KickDog based on his design. The
product was fabricated by Niska
Cheffet, a Los Angeles designer.

KickDog comes with a set of

light-hearted instructions suggest-f,
ing various ways to kick the toy and

send your frustrations with it.
But Avanzino isn’t laughing.

“We spend tens of thousands of :
dollars a year trying to teach chil-j

dren kindness to animals and to re-

spect all living things,” he said. “I‘

think the public will receive this
with extreme displeasure.“

they laughed," Murphy said. “Be-
sides, I think kids are more intelli-

gent than that. They know we’re ,

not encouraging them to be cruel to
animals. Besides, this is a toy for
adults.”

So far, he added, the reaction
from the wholesale buyers at the .

gift show has been good.

I wasn’t hurt, but the scars of

carcass will never disappear. It .

was feeling of total helplessness
to beat the pit bull with all my
might and not have it release my
dog.

The attack on my dog was not
the first or the last in a one block
vicinity. There are laws to pro-

but what about us, the victii‘ris or ’

“is legal name is Ch. Covy
Tucker Hill’s Manhattan, but
"Hatter” overcame his name
to become the ﬁrst German
shepherd ever to win the
Westminster Kennel Club
show at Madison Square Gar-
den. “He has the judgment to
know when he should be nice
and when he shouldn’t be nice,”
says co-owner Jane Firestone.
“If you were to try to go near
[handler] James Moses in an
aggressive fashion, the dog
would be very protective.

That would not be a good idea.”
Hatter will soon devote him-

2C / The Houston Post/Mom, ‘February 23, 1987
Pet lives in her memory

If you knew Suzy,

 

ne of the
many en-

. joyable as-
pects of writing this
weekly column is
receiving numerous
interesting and sen-
sitive stories from
readers about their
pets. It’s not possi-
ble to print all of
these stories; however, occasion-
ally one comes that I’d like
to share. Recently, Catherine
Schmidt of Houston sent me a sto-
ry that her daughter, Joanne,
wrote about her cat “Suzy.”

SUZY

My freshmen year at college, I
came home for the Christmas holi-
days and found her sitting on the
hall chair, near the door, a big red
ribbon around her neck. Wideveyed
and scared, she stared me down,
and I, unfamiliar with the feline
species, hesitated before introduc-
ing myself and patting the silver
tabby head. She ms only 2 months
old then, recs-tied by my mother
from thoughtless children tossing
her in a blanket to hear her cry.

Such a pretty cat she was, her
green eyes like moons, her lips like
. Clara Bow’s, her long Persian fur
mingling with short tufts inherited
from an alley-Tom father. That
summer and the following year
when I stayed home from school to
earn tuition money, Suzy and I got
to know each other well. Whatever
room I was in, she soon shared it,
amusing herself inside a paper bag
or a box, threatening pigeons from
behind a window, or lying up
against my side, ﬂattering me
with her purred contentment.

She never cheated on me those
18 years, giving only me her un-
questioning love and company.
She never called me names or hurt

 

my feelings or asked for more than
I could give -— although once, after
I left her alone a weekend, she
nipped at my ankle, ran from my
wrath, and sulked in a corner.
How vulnerable was this living
creature, so much like me, I

thought. She brings me security
and comfort and love in exchange
for a few cans of food and some lit-
ter. She is my dependent child, the
one I protect. ‘

When the end approached, she
hid from me for three days in a
corner in a closet, her only sub-
stance the water she licked from

- my fingers. I was in the kitchen

when she finally came out, barely
able to drag herself on unsure legs
before collapsing at my feet. I car-
ried her into the bed we shared,
thinking I would be there with her
those final hours — but she refused
to leave me.

“It’s all right, Suzy,” I told her.
“Don’t try to hang on. Go in peace,
baby.” But she disobeyed me, ev-
ery conscious moment spent
straining to find me, her growing
coldness searching for my
warmth. “Oh God, please don’t let
her suffer; she doesn’t deserve this
torture. Mother of God, please
take her, please.”

My mother said she didn’t feel
pain, that she was in a coma most
of the time. I knew that was sup-
posed to comfort me, yet I ques-
tioned anew my decision not to

have been painful and my aban-
diilnment the greatest torture of

I laid her in an old typewriter
case I had had since college, and I
had her buried under a tree with a
memorial stone. Sometimes I actu-
ally visit the grave and place ﬂow-
ers there, hoping she’s found eter- 7 ’
nal peace. '

My religion teacheslthat ani-
mals do not have souls, but who is
to know? When I think of Suzy

   
  
 
 
 
  
   

now, I think of her sitting on God’s
lap, ﬂattering him with purred
contentment.

[fa zoo won ”it save animals, who will?

our Feb. 14 story on the Detroit Zoo and

the fate of five snow monkeys serves as

a reminder that all zoos are not the humane

places they are supposed to be (“5 monkeys
face death or sale”).

Animals at most zoos are little more than a“

form of entertainment. When they no longer
fill that need, euthanasia and the sale of
animals to research facilities are common-
place.

Many people think of zoos as a form of
education and a place to save animals from
extinction when, in fact, the zoo trade itself
has led to endangerment.

Steve Graham is selling five surplus mon-

keys from the Detroit Zoo to a research

sion news that animal experimentation must
be moral and ethical because it exists in our
society. If it wasn’t, he said, it wouldn’t exist.
What of rape, murder and child abuse? They
also exist in our society. Does that mean
they’re moral and ethical, too?

GOD’S CREATURES, SMALL

Dear Reader, -

In our high-tech, hustle and bustle
world, we all seem to have a hankering
to get back to nature. This month’s fea-
ture on attracting butterﬂies to your
yard is another in a series of articles
we’ve published over the last couple of
years on how to get nature back to you.

If past interest is any indication, this
story should be a winner. We heard
from many of you in response to the
bird-feeding story in our November ’84
issue. After our April ’86 feature on
welcoming wildlife to your yard, more
than 8,300 of you wrote to the National
Wildlife Federation about their Back-
yard Habitat Program. Lots ‘of you who
entered our America’s Favorite Room
Decorating Contest a couple of years

 

“The weird beauty
and incredible
living habits of

these little animals
fascinate me.”

 

ago said the most important aspect of
your favorite room was the natural
view out the windows.

I’ve been especially charmed as I’ve
watched our butterﬂy article develop
because I’m a bona ﬁde bug nut. Since
childhood, I’ve had a great interest in
and affection for insects of all kinds,
butterﬂies included.

For me, one of the great anticipa-
tions in the reawakening of spring is
the return of the insects. Each year,
after our awful Iowa Winter, comes this
horde of wonderful creatures, some so
small you can hardly see them; each a
busy little organism, intent on carrying
out its destiny. The weird beauty and
incredible living habits of these little
animals fascinate me.

I might add that my eccentricity is
shared by my whole family. Once when
our youngest, Sarah, was a little girl,
her mother found her as she was about

to ﬂush a centipede down the toilet. To- -

 

 

They bring beauty and delight . . .

gether they rescued the wet little bug,
dried it off, and sent it on its way. Sarah
often reﬂects on this episode as an im-
portant life lesson.

We don’t use insecticides and deplore
the scorched-earth approach most peo-
ple take when they find a bug in the
house or garden. Sure, we swat ﬂies
and mosquitoes, but mostly we live and
let live. In fact, we have any number of
insect “pets.” One is a wasp that comes
every summer evening at cocktail time
to peel wood from our porch swing to
build her nest. We call her Muffy, an
appropriately WASP-y name. I share
my workshop all winter with lovely lit-
tle red-and-black box elder bugs. They
come in to survive the cold and to make
next year’s generation.

The fear and revulsion that people
have of insects is really too bad, be-
cause about 98 percent of all insects are
harmless or beneficial to humanity.

We should try to share our planet
with them and all the rest of God’s
creatures with as much harmony as we
can manage. Insects make our life on
earth possible, and many, like the but-
terﬂies, bring us beauty and delight.

Dog shows

ARLINGTON HEIGHTS—
People who show their dogs for
the reward of a trophy or blue
nbbon are not doing this in the
animal’s interest. The dog
couldn’t care less about a cup or
a ribbon. His" pleasure is in
being loved and pleasing his
master. .

The ribbons and trophies are
for the ego of the owner. The
dog would be much happier
With a Juicy bone. Some people
delight in putting their dog
through his paces like a machine
to .show their cOntrol over the
ammal. They are, usually,
people With very large egos that
must be inﬂated regularly.

It always amuses me when I

‘ hear these people referred to as
animal lovers. They’re just
animal show-offs. A real animal

lover is more interested in the

oompamonship and well-being

of his/her pet than putting the

ammal through paces for the

E beneﬁt of an audience. Also, a

l real animal lover has affection ‘
g for all ammals and doesn’t brag
about his own while looking
down his nose at the pets of '

Poncho, the Good Samaritan dog, with his deaf owner
Leon Tolehin: “If it hadnt been for that dog, she could
have been lying there all night in the cold.”

SOund instincts lead
to neighbor’s rescue

By Rob‘Karwath

Mabel Sauter lay in bed
Monday and planned how to
thank the hero who helped
'her get to the hospital Friday

night after she fell and broke I

her hip.

“I think,” the 77—year-old
Merrionette Park woman
said, “that I’ll give him a
bone.”

It will be reward enough for
Poncho the dog.

Friday night, as Sauter lay ‘

on the ground outside her
neighbors’ house and
screamed for help, it was
Poncho, an 8— —-year old
schnauzer mixed breed, who
alerted Jan and Leon Tolehin,

door neighbors, that some-
thing w is amiss.

Had not the dog heard sau-
ter’s screams for help, the
Tolchins said Monday, Sauter
could have lain outside for
hours in the cold before she
was found. Leon Tolehin is

deaf and his wife is hearing-
impaired. The couple said
they did not realize Sauter
was outside their door
screaming until their dog
alerted them by barking and
running around frantically in-
side the house. ,

“He’s the hero,” Leon Tol—
chin said Monday as Poncho
sat humbly at his feet. “He’s
our ears.”

Leon Tolehin, 55, a retired
newspaper Linotype operator,
was born deaf but can read
lips and speak. His wife, Jan,
53, a gym teacher at Park El-
ementary School in Orland

Life Wit
Snifﬂes

Dear Alfi's Mom:

We own a dwarf bunny, whose
name is Snifﬂes. She will be 3
years old in May, and she lives in
a wooden hutch with chicken wire
around it. We keep her in my
daughter’s bedroom and clean her
cage twice a day. It takes approxi-
‘ mately five minutes to clean her.
We have aluminum foil on the
ﬂoor of her cage, then newspa-
pers, then an oven liner made of
foil, that can be bought in super-
markets. We place absorbent pa-
per towels over that, then place
her wire mesh ﬂoor over it. We
just have to raise her floor, take
out the towels, wipe up a little
with disinfectant and replace with
clean ones.

We allow her to run around the
kitchen a lot, and she likes to hide
under my dry sink. Sometimes she
will allow you to pick her up, but
mostly it is, “catch me if you can.”

My daughter lets her jump onto
her bed from her cage, and she
stays there for awhile if my
daughter is reading or something.
She likes to investigate all the
stuffed animals and dolls on the
bed. She has chewed one phone
wire, so all wires are out of her
reach now. .

We feed her 20 percent rabbit
pellets. She was weaned on those
from the breeder and dumps any—
thing less than 20 percent. We
treat her with carrots or celery
twice a week; no lettuce. We let
her have about 10 ﬂakes of cereal
every morning. lf she is in the
mood she will eat them out of our
hands, if not. she'll rub her chin
on one and that is to let you know
she wants them in her bowl.

- Feb. 22,

 

 

 

She can be moody. If we go to
pick her up and she doesn’t want
to be, she gives a little growl, but
most of the time she can be cud-
dled and is full of kisses. She likes
to have you cup your hands over
her eyes and she just nuzzles into
your hand.

Bald eagles visiting the Rocky .

a regional study on how man might
be poisoning America’s national
bird. . ,

A group of about 20 bald eagles
was discovered roosting at the
' highly contaminated arsenal last
November, and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service has received per-
mission to include the birds in a
three-year study of metal poison-
ing in eagles in Colorado and Utah.

The arsenal eagles are the first '
to be trapped for the new contami-
nation-testing project, said Rick

The arsenal eagles, which so far
are only visiting the 27-square-mile
faCility and have not yet built nests
there, were chosen for the study
because they are easily accessible,
said Krueger.

The study will focus on poisoning
of eagles and other raptors from
the lead in shotgun shells, as well
as possible poisoning from some
contaminants at the arsenal.

Eagles, especially bald eagles,
live mostly on fish and injured
birds, and “a good deal of the birds

that are injured are waterfowl shot ‘

by hunters with lead shot,” Krue-

. ger said.

“In this study,” Krueger said,
“we’re curious about the elevated
levels of lead and other contami-

nants in birds that have survived.”

The point, Krueger said, is that

said. The eagles also will be ana-

If the voters of Hillsborough County
ban the use of unwanted, abandoned
animals in medical research, what
will happen?

Those animals will die anyWay -- a
meaningless death. They’ll be put to
death by the pound.

But medical research involving ani- '
.mals won’t stop. Researchers -— unable
to use unwanted pound animals — will
purchase animals from professional
research animal breeders at over 40 times
the cost. 4

Unwanted pound animals will die any-
way. And the dogs bred for research will
die, too. The only outcome of your “”no
vote will be a heavier burden for tax-_
payers to support the purchase of more
expensive animals.

You aren’t voting to save animals’ lives.
Don’t let a small group of activists lead
you to believe otherwise. _

 

Don’t let anyone confuse the issue.

ubious deeds, it was performed
lurtively, under cover of darkness.
The so-called “killer” whales
orky and Orky, beloved by tens of
housands of children (and adults),
' ere snatched from their quiet la-
-oon at LA’s popular Marineland
heme park, lifted on giant slings in-
o flat-bed trucks and spirited away
to a secret new location.

The whale-nappers have now
been revealed as the new owners of
the 33-year-old aquatic park and an-
imal refuge, publisher-conglomerate
Harcourt Brace Jovanich.

The giant Florida-based corpora-
tion, which already owns Sea World
Parks in San Diego and Orlando,
bought Marineland on Dec. 31 for
$24 million. It then announced it
would close the park and disband
its animal refuge, where thousands
of pollution- and man-injured rare
wild birds, seals, sea-lions and other
sea creatures have been treated
and saved over the years.

The cries of protest at this dis-

which Marineland was the main
tourist attraction. “They wanted the
whales, and nothing else.”

The vast, agile, white-on-black

"performing stars, known to millions

of Americans through appearances
on TV shows and commercials, had
been taken to Sea World in San Die-
go. Sea World lost its permit to cap-
ture more live killer whales last
year when two of its rare mammals
died in captivity.

California animal protectionists
are sure Corky and Orky will be
moved again, eventually, to yet an-
other Sea World. This will be the
huge new Disneyland-ish $150 mil-
lion aquatic park that Harcourt
Brace plans to build outside San An-
tonio, Texas. ’ '

“These guys are just burglars,"
councilor Ryan said. “They stole
our whales, they. robbed a magnifi-
cent educational institution and
closed down a wildlife health and
research center that cannot be re-
placed just to make a buck.”

' Palos Verdes was outraged. Pro-
test marches were staged. At well-
televised public meetings bitter de-
nunciations and outright threats

were hurled at bemused representas

tives of the East Coast conglomer-
ate. . ,
Harcourt executives pleaded
that Marineland was not “cost-
effective." The company would

 

have had to spend $18 million for
larger tanks for the whales and $25
million more on other expansions to
raise attendance at the 96-acre site
from 800,000 a year to 1.2 million.
“Who wants more people?” ,quee
ried an irate protestor at one city
council meeting. “This is a typical
example of a totally insensitive con-
glomerate giant bulldozing its way,
into a modest community like ours,

stripping its most valued assets, and

clearing out.” .

Clearing out is indeed what Har-
court Brace intends to do. So bad
and so broad has been the publicity
surrounding the company’s decision
to close the park that on Feb. 23
Harcourt announced its decision to
sell Marineland (but keep the
whales). '

“The flak has been so tremen-
dous and so unexpected,” said Jer-
old Miles, attorney for Harcourt
Brace, “that my clients felt it would

not be a good idea to try and devel- - ‘3'

op this property themselves.”

So far, Harcourt hasn’t set a
price. But even if the company does
sell its most recent acquisition to
someone who would maintain it in
the old style, life will never be the
same in Palos Verdes. Not only are

' the whales gone: thousands of Har-

court Brace schooi textbobks have
been thrown out of schools and
homes.

# A Big wildlife preserve
for hunters envisioned

I.
3

£3! The New York Times

3 MISSOULA, Mont. -— Montana
huehem are being asked to imag-
pm a future in which wildlife would
roam their land in the abundance
lunar greeted the explorers Lewis
land Clark in 1805. x

:3 Under a recently proposed plan,
715,000 square miles of the northern
{Great Plains would be transformed
"into a game preserve for hunters
rivaling those in Africa.

, The “Big Open” proposal has
been offered by Robert Scott, a
amilton, Mont., resident who out-
' ed his ideas at a conference
’sponsored by the Institute of the
,iﬁockies, a Missoula—based nonprof-
it group of academic and business
leaders. _ - .

gEconomlc attraction

;* Scott is convinced his plan would
reverse dismal economic condi-
tions plaguing a sparsely settled
eastern Montana area near Gar-

field County and the town of J or-‘

don, population 485.

' As envisioned, the program
would cover 10 percent of Mon-
tana, stretching on both sides of
,the Missouri River between High-
;ways 2 and 12. ‘

. With the fences down and do-
linestic animals gone, Scott says
the land could support more than
300,000 wild animals: a bison herd
of 75,000, along with 150,000 deer,
40,000 elk and 40,000 antelope. Rep-
resentatives of the institute plan to
visit local communities to per-
suade farmers and ranchers to
support the plan.

2 That will be no simple task, says
Chase Hibbard, 3 Helena area
rancher, who suggests Scott should
first “play this scenario in the Hell
Creek Bar in J ordon.”

1. Mayor Mary Ann Engdahl of
Llordan agrees. “You may have a
frevolution at first,” she says.

., But times are tough. “Lots of

people are hanging on by a shoe-

n plains of Montana

string,” she says. Perhaps some of
the younger ranchers, those less
firmly entrenched in their ways,
might be willing to give the plan a
try, especially if it is the only way
they can save their land, she says.

Of Montana’s 24,000 farms and
ranches, half are expected to fail
by 1990, according to Allen Bjergo,
an economist who heads the insti-
tute. He says that by the year 2000
only 6,000 ranches will remain if
trends continue.

The expenses of running a farm
or ranch have risen dramatically
in recent decades, but the prices
ranchers and farmers get for their
cows, sheep and wheat have stay-
ed about the same.

“In 1949, three fat steers, or 500
bushels of grain, would buy a new
car,” he says. “Now it takes 10
times as much.”

Some ranches already have
switched from raising domestic an-
imals to raising wildlife. The Shel-
don Ranch of Bozeman, Mont.,
raises elk and sells threeday hunts
for $5,500,, said Steve Laursen, a
forester at the Montana State Uni-
versity extention.

The “Big Open” plan would ex-
pand the concept of individual

' game farms to a regional level, de-

veloping deals with cooperation of
farmers and perhaps state govern-
ment.

Establishing a large game range
would provide long-term economic
development and would help pre-
serve the quality of life, Scott says.
The plan is designed to keep ranch-
ers on their own land, doing some-
thing similar to what they have al-
ways done, he adds.

He says ranchers would make
more money raising wildlife than
they do raising domestic animals
and with far less trouble. Up to $50
million could be raised annually
from sale of hunting permits alone,
under a cooperative arrangement
between the state and local land
owners, he estimates.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - February 25, 1987

Future Shrin

By Jack V iets

Chronicle Correspondent

Fallon, Nev.

The vast Stillwater Wildlife
Refuge some 20 miles east of
here has been transformed into
an endless cemetery for the
wildlife it was created to pro-
tect.

In windrows that stretch as far
as the eye can see, the remains of
millions of fish lie where they were
thrown against the barren shore by
winter winds and waves.

So far, the toll is 7 million to 8
million fish. The carnage has been
going on for about two weeks — and

. it will continue. The rest of the

, lake’s fish population, estimated to

, be another 7 million to 8 million, is

- expected to die off by degrees as the
lake shrinks.

‘

, Hundreds of migratory birds
.,_ also have been found dead, victims
9 of an outbreak of avian cholera.

The birds’ stinking bodies have

L; been 'cremated in great bonfires to

. try to get rid of their diseased car-

casses before they are eaten by

j, birds of prey, such as eagles, which

- would spread the disease even fur-
ther.

, But the remains of the fish,
most of them tui chub, a scavenger
:3 that is a favorite food of the white
'3; pelican, have been left on the shore-
: line at the western Nevada refuge.
,.,

Although exhaustive tests that
, will show why the fish and birds are

' dying have not been completed, the
5;; US. Fish and Wildlife Service work-
1: ers who run the 224,000acre refuge
"-- have a pretty good gut idea what is
,‘if' wrong.

“It’s extremely salty” in the the
f» huge 10-by-20mile lake that lies in
’3' the refuge, said Stillwater biologist
5 Steve Thompson. “It’s half as salty
' as sea water.”

The salt forms because the lake
I, has no outflow. The desolate land
beneath it is in essence a massive
. alkaline flat, and when the water in
- the lake evaporates in the heat of a
, Nevada summer, the salts concen-
-. trate. The saline level soars as the
»-. lake recedes.

Salt is enough to kill any fresh-

water fish, such as the chubs, but -

the deadly salinity of the Stillwater
refuge is only symptomatic of the
' long-range, problems of the refuge.

 

 

 

Humboldt” rivers is called the Car-
son Sink —- and each year it is grow-
ing smaller, and more polluted.

The reason: the pressures of
boom times and soaring populations
in gambling spas, such as the Reno-
Sparks area, Carson City and in the
Truckee-Carson Irrigation District.

“Everybody has to have fresh
water,” said Anglin.

So increasing numbers of peo-
ple are getting the fresh water that
used to flow into the refuge — and
increasing flows of their polluted
wastewater from sewer plants, in-
dustries and farms and ranches are
flowing into the refuge.

Consequently, the quality of

.. the water in the refuge “keeps go-

' , ing downhill,” he said. “People con-

? tinue to dump low-qualify water in-
to the marsh.”

Ultimately, unless people
change their ways and the Western
tradition of boom-town mentality,
the refuge will die, along with all its
wildlife, he predicted.

The refuge must be given

“shots of fresh water” if it is to
* ' survive, he said.

“People are going to have to
decide that birds and other wildlife

 

are entitled to live in a fresh, clean
and healthy habitat.

“Birds need water rights. But
man makes policy. Birds and wild-
life don’t,” he said.

‘ West Texas trappers try to outsmart
hardy, canny coyotes

By Ramona Nye
MIDLAND REPORTER-TELEGRAM

‘ MIDLAND —_ Bouncing over grease weed in a
camouﬂaged pickup with an automatic .22 propped in
the middle,of the seat, Bill Powers begins another

work day.

“There’s lots of people against this. People that
don’t own any stock. They (coyotes) are not eating
their sheep. That makes a difference,” says Powers,
who has been trapping in Midland County for the

past 22 years. .

Once viewed as loners who helped carve out the
Wilderness, trappers nowadays are viewed by some of

the public as a leftover evil from the past.

But as long as there are sheep and cattle, there will
always be coyotes and trappers trying to “control” the

hardy and intelligent canines, Powers says.

“It keeps you awake at night trying to catch some

of these smart coyotes,” the 52-year-old trapper says.

Powers along with his 30-year-old son, Steve Pow-
ers, trap for about 35 sheep ranchers and cattlemen in

south Midland County. ’

The men are among 200 trappers statewide em-
ployed by the Texas Rodent and Predatory Animal
Control, a division of Texas A&M’s extension service
and the US. Deparment of Agriculture.

A coalition of ranchers contribute $400 a month
and Midland County pays $1,400 a month along with
a state match of $1,800 a month to fund the trapping
program, says John Dorsett, district supervisor with
the animal control agency.

‘ The agency’s yearly budget of about $43,200 pro-
vides the two trappers with a salary of about $1,200 a
month.

Although conservationists have raised concerns
about wiping out the coyote population, the elder
Powers says he has seen little difference in the canine
population over the last 22 years.

Every year, the father—and—son team say they kill
between 350 to 400 coyotes in Midland County.

Powers says the coyotes drift in every year from

 

- .....(

the counties north of Midland where there are no

trappers.

“They drift in about as fast as we can catch them ”
he says. ,

The trappers insist it would be impossible to wipe
out coyotes. .

“The reason we still got coyotes and will always

have coyotes is because they are pretty intelligent
anlmals,” Powers says.

 

“A coyote gets smarter than a trapper pretty quick,”

he says. ' . . ~'

But Powers says he does not want to Wipe out
coyotes, he wants to control them.

The trappers are a necessity, insists one area sheep
rancher, James Walton.

“I wouldn’t be in the sheep business without them,”

says Walton, who runs about 3,000 sheep on 23,000 23:1

acres .

While the rates vary from year to year, Walton says
he has lost up to 30 percent of his lambs in one year
to coyotes and bobcats.

January and February are the beginning of the
Powers’ busiest season with ewes beginning to drop
lambs. .

Pointing to jack rabbits running left and right as
the pickup bounces across the pasture, Powers says,
“They could catch some of these rabbits if they want-
ed to, but they come in here and kill these sheep.”

“Baby lambs are a whole lot easier for a coyote and
a whole lot tastier,” he says.

Five days a week, year-round, the two men check
and set trap lines over about 320,000 acres of south
Midland County.

Once a coyote starts to kill sheep, the Powerses
begin patrolling a special net fencing sheep ranchers
use in place of barbed wire. -

Because the fencing is netted, coyotes have to dig
holes under it, and rarely jump over, Powers said.

Cruising fence lines in their pickups, the Powerses,
who work separately, can easily spot tell-tale shallow
holes called “slides” left by a coyote entering a pas—
ture.

Sometimes red foxes or bobcats are the culprits and
traps are set accordingly, Powers says.

The may a lamb or calf is eaten determines what
kind of animal killed it. Coyotes eat out the hindquar-
ters of a lamb, bobcats eat out of the shoulder and red
foxes will eat anywhere on the animal, Powers says.

Once a hole is found, the trappers will lap a tarp
down to kneel on as they set the trap. The tarp helps
leave as little human scent as possible.

The trapper digs under the hole to lay a spring—

 

- steel. trap that will clamp onto the coyote’s leg.

were more than 3,800 reported
cases of fox rabies throughout the
continent.

The tide of fox-borne rabies
has been sweeping westwards
from the Siberian steppes since
the second world war, but for
some inexplicable reason it has
stopped in France 100 miles
inland from the Channel coast.

Specialists at the French gov-
ernment rabies research centre
near Nancy are trying to find out
why. They are also analysing the
34,000 cases of rabies which have
occurred in France since the
disease arrived there in 1968.

They now know that with the
exception of 'a scattering of cases
in the Paris region, the problem
is a central and northern Euro-

was probably transferred from
polar foxes to red foxes.

However, contrary to popular
belief, although a dog can catch
the disease from a fox, there are
no recorded instances of one dog
passing the virus to another dog.
In fact dog-bome rabies dis-
appeared from Europe in the last
century as the wild dog popula-
tion was controlled.

Meanwhile in the rest of the
world there are a variety of rabies
viruses carried by different ani-
mals: dogs in the third world,
skunks and raccoons in north
America and vampire bats in
Latin America.

This Latin American strain has
broken out in Denmark in the
past few years, having probably
been carried over by bats on a
cargo ship. The reason why this
variety has been contained in and
around Denmark is because bats
are not as mobile as foxes.

Kids key
in helping
panther .

By DIANA SMITH
Associated Press

. TALLAHASSEE — Explaining
that children may be the best hope
for saving the Florida panther from
extinction, groups are promoting
brochures, games and “Panther
Pack Clubs” to mobilize the support
of fourth-graders for the state ani-
mal.

“If the children become interest-
ed in the plight of the panther, we
think they will be the ones who will
eventually solve the problem,” said
Alice Von Suskil, chairman of the
conservation department for the
Florida Federation of Women’s
Clubs.

Getting children interested in
the panther’s future will be a step
toward getting their parents inter-
ested, she said. Fourth-graders were

targeted because that was the level _

where children start learning about
their state’s environment, she said.

The brochures, printed at a cost
of $4,000, are being distributed by
the Florida Defenders of the Envi-
ronment. , .

Meanwhile, efforts to breed a
captive Florida panther with a fe-
male western cougar have been un-
successful so far‘ because the male
won’t have anything to do with her.

“The female is doing everything
right,” said Chris Belden, a biologist
with the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission. “She
grooms him and shows him all
kinds of affection, but he just turns
around and swats her.”

 

Attempts to get this Florida panther to mate
with a female western cougar have proved fu-

tile thus far. The panther, named “Big Guy,”

The Florida Defenders of the
Environment and the women’s

. clubs announced plans in Tallahas-

see to distribute brochures to in-
form children about the dwindling
panthers and enlist them in “Pan-
ther PackClubs.”

The brochure tells the fictional
story of a little girl whose father
nearly runs over a panther on a
South Florida highway by accident,
then uses the story line to explain
why only 25 or so panthers are
known to still exist in Florida.

was hit by a car and can’t be returned to the
wild.

The brochure includes a game
that urges the children to help guide
the mother panther through a maze
past trucks, cars, roads, buildings,
farms and other development to the
wildlife-refuge where her hungry
kittens are waiting.

Pet characteristics
As you can see, there are many things to think

about when choosing a pet. You are looking for a
comfortable matching of the pet’s greatest needs and

 

' outstanding characteristics to your family’s needs

and characteristics.
Below are additional facts about the five most pop-

~ ular pets: cats, dogs, birds, fish and small mammals

(like gerbils, for instance).
1. Choices

Within each of the five major categories of pets
there are many individual kinds of pets to choose
from. There are over 150 breeds of dogs and over 50
' breeds of cats. The most popular dogs are shepherds,

spamels, hounds, poodles and retrievers. The most
prized cats are the Siamese, Angora. Persian and
two kinds of short hair, the silver tabby and the tor-
totse-shell tabby. Mixed breeds in cats and dogs also

 

make fine pets. Obviously, you have too many

2, Size mammals need cages and materials for nesting. The »
more exotic the pet the greater its housing needs"
The greatest range in size occurs in dogs, which may be. As a general rule, exotic pets are not suit;
can be as tiny as the Chihuahua and as huge as the able for the average family. In fact, there are a num‘f'
Great Dane. Your choice should fit the size of your her of birds and animals protected by law and that

home and the age of the children in your family. Be may not be brought into the United States legally.*:;:
sure to ask how big that cute little puppy will grow!

3. Temperament

Some pets are very calm; others are very nervous
or energetic. Some love to play; others like to be
alone. As an example, a family with young children
shouldn’t have an excitable, snappy dog for a pet. ,

4. Specialties

Birds need protective cages placed out of drafts
and away from heavy traffic areas. Fish need tanks .
plus air to maintain their natural environment. Small

'” Familiarity breeds contempt,

not rhinos, at Fort Worth zoo

By Michael Sawicki
OF THE TiMES HERALD STAFF

Zoo ofﬁcials in Fort Worth as well as
Houston have discovered there are some
things that can’t be rushed.

The two white rhinoceroses at Fort
Worth Zoological Park have failed to
mate in about 20 years, despite entice—
ments such as special food and a weeks-
long vacation.

The Houston Zoo has the same prob—
lem with a pair of white rhinos that ar-'
rived there about 15 years ago. Houston
ofﬁcials are hoping a $25,000 study of the
sex habits of the animals will prompt
them to mate and reproduce.

At the Fort Worth 200, Masipola and

Chief Mumza, both about 22 years old,
have been prodded and pampered to
consummate their relationship. .

“We’re still working on it,” said Jeanne
J acobsen, who has cared for the two rhi-
nos for more than eight years. “There are
several studies being done on this and
there could be new advances in hormone
technology any day. We’re not going to

give up.”

Zoo ofﬁcials have taken several ap—.

proaches since Masipola and Chief

Mumza arrived in 1968. They have fed

_ beasts a special diet. They have

appealed to their senses by spread-
ing the scent of other rhinos
throughout their yard. They put
them with breeding pairs to give
them the general idea.

The big animals usually live in
herds, Jacobsen said, so scientists
believe rhinos become stimulated
only in the company of others of
their kind. When left alone or in
pairs, rhinos are generally very
tame and tend to spend their days
lazily eating and walking around,
J acobsen said.

But the scent of another rhino
often is enough to make them ag-
gressive and can put them in the
mood to mate.

Last year, Jacobsen said, two
older rhinos from the zoo in Los
Angeles were transferred to Fort
Worth in the hope that both cou-

ples would mate. Special arrange-
ments were made at a ranch in
Llano, Texas, to accommodate the
four animals, and the two couples
spent several weeks living with
each other.“

TAMPA TRIBUNE - February 2.7, 1987

 

 

A small group of activists would have it '
another way.

These people put the lives of un-
wanted, abandoned animals above those
of people. They would have you vote to
put a stop to vital medical research that
depends on animals. .

The irony is, these animals would die
anyway. Abandoned animals that would
otherwise be destroyed in a pound — a
meaningless death -— are instead being
used to save human lives through medi-
cal research. ’

Almost all medical knowledge and
treatment has involved research using
animals. But The Hillsborough County
Humane Society would have us ban
the use of pound animals in medical
research.

What kind of society puts the lives of
unwanted animals above those of sick
and crippled children and adults? Not a
humane society.

 

Put peoples” lives first.

TAMPA TRIBUNE — February 27, 1987

Animals Treated
Professionally

This is in regard the Feb. 4 letter con—
cerning the use of abandoned pound ani- :
mals for medical research at the Univer- ;

sity of South Florida.

While I cannot comment on the issue
of medical research at other institutions, I
can enlighten the writer on one point and .

clear up a misconception.

As a second- -year medical student at ‘
USF, I have seen firsthand the tremen- .

dous benefit animals provide in further-

ing the advances of medical research and 1
in affording medical students much

needed experience.

During their surgical training, these i

future physicians are taught to treat each ‘
animal as a patient undergoing a profes- g

sionally conducted surgical procedure.
Under a surgeon’s guide and supervision,

1'

a team of students, works together on the '

procedure, all the while ensuring that the
patient is properly anesthetized.

These animals are under anesthesia
throughout the procedure, so they experi-
ence no pain or suffering. When the sur-

, is completed and the surgical inci-
.on is properly sutured, the animals do

not regain consciousness They are anes-
thetically euthanized.

The animals are treated in the most
humane manner, and their use in training
medical students provides the confidence
a future surgeon will need in the operat-
ing room while trying to save the life of a
human being.

I Wish the use of all animals for medi-

cal research could be replaced by a reai- ‘

sonable and rational alternative, but that
is not feasible yet. Medical students real-
ize that the use of unwanted pound ani-
mals is a humane practice which is neces-
sary for our education as well as for the
advancement of medical research.

I urge all Hillsborough County resi-
dents to vote yes March 3 for the referen-
dum allowing the use of pound animals
for medical research and teaching.‘

RALPH A. LEON-*7
Tampa: T

Pound Seizure
ls Petty Politics

Let’s cut through the euphemistic
rhetoric and talk about the real issue be-
hind pound seizure. It’s money and petty
politics.

For many years USF College of Medi-
cine has purchased cats and dogs from
the pound for use in both research and
teaching. The Hillsborough County pound
not only sold the animals to meet USF’s

requests, but encouraged the practice by
offering quantity discounts. That is until
autumn of 1986.

Judge Vernon Evans ordered that
pound seizure be stopped, ruling that the
county animal ordinance prohibits pound
animals from being used for research.
Now the only way USF can have access to
pound animals is by the county commis-
sion specifically changing the animal con-
trol ordinance to allow it.

The bullying begins. USF is loudly de-
manding our lost pets. It says life-saving
research will stop. They are needed to
teach physicians. The other side says,
wrong. USF has no right to our pets.

Life-saving research and training will
not stop if pound seizure is rejected by the
voters. What will be curbed is unneces-
sary, repetitive, inhumane research
which is used to generate grant money.
It’s a cash issue. Research is big business
and USF wants a piece of the pie.

USF has invited and enticed research-
ers to work at the medical school and one
of the benefits offered was a cheap,
steady supply of animals from the pound.
However, USF promised something that
was never its to give. What it is concerned
about now is its budget.

Would I sacrifice my pet to save a
human life? Yes.

Would I sacrifice my pet to save USF
a few dollars? No. ~

Because of those answers 1am voting
no and rejecting pound seizure,~

Dr. Frank Martin
rides herd on
ailing animals

By BARBARA BOUGH’I‘ON
Post Reporter

 

r. Fi‘ank Martin has the best job
in the rodeo. Mostly, he
doesn’t do anything but watch

the action.

Yet, occasionally there’s an emer-
gency. And that’s when Martin, 30,
Springs into action, carrying his
stethoscope and bandages.

Martin’s the rodeo veterinarian, the
man who makes sure that all the ani-
mals are fit and healthy. He usually
treats minor problems such as
sprained tendons or cuts and bruised
backs. Often the animals recover with
a few stitches or a few hours of rest.

"I sit and wait for problems that,
hopefully, never develop,” Martin
says.

Yet his presence is important. If
something were to really go wrong, he
would be there.

At 3 p.m., he is watching a barrel
racer practice. Martin has been on the
ground ﬂoor of the Astrodome since
7:30 a.m. and he’ll be spending a few
more hours here, watching over the
animals. Martin must be at the rodeo
every day from start to finish and
works a 12-hour day. And though the
job gets tedious sometimes, he doesn’t
mind. Being the rodeo vet -— a service
he performs for free — is rewarding, a
good work for a good cause.

Most of the problems at the rodeo,
he says, are minimal because the ani-
mals are in such good condition. Also
the rodeo dirt floor is so smooth that
horses and bulls have less chance of in-
jury than in a pasture, which is full of
holes.

Martin has been the rodeo vet for
five years and a veterinarian for nine.
He’s in private practice in the north-
east part of town where he treats hors-
es, cows, dogs and cats, he says. He

Martin watches over the hundred or

tion to the bucking animals, making
sure that electrical prods —- which are
used only if the animal refuses to buck
— are not used unnecessarily. (Most of

strap of leather around their sensitive
ﬂanks.) When a young cowboy or cow-

perhaps he has a slight limp — Martin
will often help him or her decide
whether the horse is fit to ride. “I’m
always right here, so they ask me,”
Martin says.

arena and the stalls that house the
horses used in the grand entry.
The cubicle is filled with medical
supplies —- yards of bandages,
countless bottles of antibiotics, su-
ture material and syringes and 80
liters of IV ﬂuid. “It can take 20 to
30 liters for a horse, if he goes into
shock, so 80 liters is not all that big

‘ a supply,” he says. Horses are

large animals and they need large
dosages of medicine.

Martin also spends a few hours
in the Astrodome before and after
the rodeo, checking to see that
none of the arriving or departing
animals has injuries. Sometimes
he’ll do a cursory sight check on
an animal; sometimes he checks
its teeth and hooves. “I try to see
every single animal even though I
don’t give all of them a hands-on
exam,” he says.

Still, despite such work, there
are long stretches of hours when

there’s nothing to do. “I get a little——

But suturing wounds is on] a
part of Martin’s work. He alsg

treats such ailments as colic. Colic

then an emergency comes along — _
about two every year. Last year a
barrel horse injured his foot and

‘Martin had to put the foot in a

splint. The horse was then taken to
an animal hospital.

Then a steer-wrestling horse cut
himself on the latch to the gate
that closed his pen. Martin still
can’t quite figure out how the
horse did it —- the latch was quite
high — but he acknowledges that,
with horses, anything can happen.
They’re injury-prone animals.
“They can ﬁgure a way to get hurt
when there’s no way to get hurt.”

Martin sutured the cut, which
ran down the horse’s ﬂank and leg,
a difficult and time-consuming
procedure. Suturing the wound
took an hour and a half. Martin
could only use a local anesthetic
because general anesthesia would
have knocked the horse out and he
would have laid down, making the
wound impossible to reach.

So Martin had to contend with

 

to roll and thrash and hurt them-

selves. Sometimes they even go

into shock. Luckily, no such disas-

Martin likes treating horses and

cows. In his practice, he often

makes pasture calls and has treat-
ed most every condition. Growing
up on a farm with calves, pigs and ,.

horses, Martin developed a love

an upright but jittery horse. “Ev-
ery time I’d take a step, he’d take
a step,” Martin says with a chuck-
le. “He was a moving target.”
Martin’s job is not without its
dangers. He considers bucking
horses and bulls the most perilous.
When they sustain an injury,
they’re put in a special pen and
Martin reaches through slats be-
tween the bars of the pen to treat
the animal. He doesn’t want to bet

for animals at a young age. Mar-
tin, who is single, has 10 hors-
es, two dogs and a cat.

“Animals are a way of life,” he
— says.

And for Martin, so is being the
rodeo vet. “It’s something that
needs to be done,” he says as he
gently pats a brown barrel horse

_, and examines its teeth. “You’ve
got to care for the animals. ”

NEW YORK TIMES - March 3, 1987

Canadian Effort to Kill Wolves
Raises Fears About the Species

 

By JOHN F. BURNS

 

Special to The New York Times

ANCOUVER, British Colum-
bia — Five years ago, offi-
. cials in British Columbia, in-
tent on protecting the local
game populations of elk, moose and
caribou, quietly approved a major
“wolf kill” in the northeastern fast-
ness of the province, where the wolf
has enjoyed one of its last major ref-
uges in North America.

When word of the kill program
leaked out, and especially when it
switched from poisoning to shooting
from helicopters, it became highly
controversial.

Despite a 15—year moratorium on
government control measures, the
killing of wolves by hunters and grow-
ing enroachments on their habitats
had already caused their numbers in
British Columbia to decline precipi~
tously, to an estimated 7,000 in 1980
from 23,000 in 1975 and perhaps three
times that many in 1960.

Last month, after a year’s suspen-
sion, the program resumed in the
Fort Nelson area, once more using
shooting from helicopters. Apart
from objections to the aerial shooting,

a practice normally prohibited under _

Canadian law, the new campaign has
raised fears that Canada, a land once
roamed by tens of thousands of
wolves and which still has more of the
species than any other country, is
perhaps pushing them toward extinc-
tion within a lifetime.

Opposition to the kill has come
largely from Project Wolf, an organi-
zation headed by a founder of Green-
peace that has drawn support from
wildlife biologists at government and
academic institutions around the
country who say that the scientific ra-
tionale for the kill program was
flawed. Although Project Wolf’s lead-
er, Paul Watson, a controversial fig-
ure among environmentalists for his
attacks on whaling ships, acknowl-
edges that there is no way to impede
the current kill program, he is con-
vinced that an emotionally charged
publicity campaign will eventually
prevail, much as it did in the Federal
Government’s 1983 decision to halt
the seal hunt off the country’s east
coast.

Opponents of the kill are fighting
not just the Government, but also

I

local merchants who rely on the
game animals to bring in hunters.
And, according to Mr. Watson and
others, they are fighting a centuries-
old image of the wolf as a vicious and
demonic creature, an image many
biologists say is undeserved.

Poison, Traps and Riﬂes

In Canada, the drive to eradicate
the species is older than the country
itself. In 1793 the parliament of Upper
Canada, now Ontario, passed “An Act
to Encourage the Destruction of
Wolves and Bears." Since then, Cana-
dians intent on protecting farm and
game animals that are the wolves’
natural prey have pursued the preda-
tors with poison, traps and rifles.

Schemes to eliminate the wolf had
been running for years in Alaska and
in the Yukon, the only other territo-
ries in North America that have wolf
populations numbering in the thou-
sands. The species has long since dis-
appeared in most other parts of the
United States.

When the British Columbia pro.
gram began five years ago in these
forested valleys on the lower slopes of
the Rockies, it attracted little contro-
versy. But after li:-...~ed success with

 

Opponents say aims
to preserve game for .
hunters. ‘

 

poisoning, Dr. John Elliott, a provin—
cial wildlife biologist who was the

program’s instigator, recommended

that the “treatment,” as Government
documents of the time described it, be
switched to shooting from helicop-
ters.

In a brief to his superiors, Dr. El-
liott urged that the scheme aim at “a
removal of a minimum of 75 percent”
of the wolves in two target areas:, the
Muskwa Valley 50 miles southwest of
Fort Nelson and the Kechika Valley
150 miles west of the town.

Dr. Elliott, an Alberta-born special-
ist who gained his doctoral degree
studying predators in Africa, mar-
shalled an array of statistics to un-
derscore his contention that failure to
thin out the wolves would exacerbate
a crash in prey populations, and pos-
sibly eliminate them altogether.

In 1984, and again in 1985, Dr. E1-

,liott and his assistants lured the

Muskwa and Kechika wolves into for-
est clearings with a bait of dead

' moose, then moved in aboard a heli-

copter with 12-gauge semi-automatic
shotguns. Firing from a low altitude,
they ran the total number of wolves
killed, counting those poisoned in the
two years before the shooting began,
up to 700. -

From the opening shot, officials
faced the kind of outrage from animal
lovers that the seal hunt had generat-
ed. Dr. Elliott, who has been reluctant
to discuss the issue publicly, was vili-
fied.

Wolves Return to Valleys

In 1986, with the numbers of prey
species reviving, the wolf kill was
suspended. But wolves returned to
the valleys more rapidly than expect~
ed, and Government biologists feared
the prey species would resume their
precipitous decline. According to fig-
ures made public by Dr. Elliott, the
cumulative fall in these populations
over the last decade has been “cata-
strophic,” with caribou down by 75
percent, or 7,500 animals, moose by 80
percent, or 90,000 animals, and moun-
tain sheep by 50 percent, or 7,000 ani-
mals.

The Government decided to re-
sume the Muskwa program, with a
goal of 200 kills. The provincial Pre-
mier, William Vander Zalm, was be-
sieged ' by demonstrators from
Project Wolf. He reaffirmed the
project, saying that the province had
to kill wolves since hunters would not.
“The problem is, all of the other ani—
mals get killed, and the wolves are
left,” he said. “We don’t have nature
taking care of things.”

But a number of academicians
have concluded that the program was
flawed by data that made unjustified
assumptions about wildlife popula-
tion trends, or failed to take account
of factors other than wolves that
could account for declining prey
groups, such as weather variations
and the effects of man’s growing in-
roads into the wilds. One factor given
little weight in Dr. Elliott’s reports is
poaching, said to account for at least
double the 50,000 animal kills at-
tributed to wolves in British Colum-
bia every year.

Charles Krebs, a zoology professor
at the University of British Columbia,
was scornful of the Elliott team’s

wood.” At the University of Guelph, in
Ontario, a specially convened com-
mittee drew up an extensive critique
that concluded, “There is no biologi-
cal basis or justification for the wolf-
control program.”

Where it involves the shooting in
1984 and 1985, that is an argument
that Stephen Rogers, Minister of the
Environment in the Vander Zalm
government, seems ready to accept.

‘We’re on Solid Ground’

Mr. Rogers, a former airline pilot,
recommended resumption of the
shooting. But in a telephone inter-
view, he said he did so only after
some skeptical questioning of senior
officials. “I asked their: i-iave we got
good biological data to back this thing
up?’ And they told me, ‘The last time
we didn’t have it, but this time we do.’
So I think we’re on solid ground on
this one now. ”

_ One point of contention remains Dr.
Elliott’s assumption that the achieve-
ment: of an equilibrium between the
wolves and their prey requires

human “management.” Mr. Watson
of Project Wolf said that a studies
done elsewhere suggest that nature
left to itself will achieve a long-term

balance. He cited the situation on Isle
Royale, a ‘ United States island in
Lake Superior, where, he said, studies
have shown a wolf pack and prey
populations, including moose, that
have remained at a rough equilib-
rium since the 1930’s.

Adding intensity to the protests
were official acknowledgments that-
the killing had as its principal goal
the promotion of the local hunting in-
dustry, whose guides and outfitters
rely, like the wolves, on the caribou,
the elk and the mountain sheep.

The hoofed animals are prized by

the high—spending visitors, mostly,

Americans and West Germans, who
fly into Fort Nelson each autumn and
winter, spending $5, 000 and more in a
week for the aircraft, guides and
equipment needed for a successful
shoot.

After an unsuccessful attempt to
disrupt the 1984 program, when he
and his associates were defeated by
extreme cold in their attempt to trek
into the kill zones, Mr. Watson,
Project Wolf’s leader in Vancouver,
acknowledged that the organization
is powerless to impede the new
Muskwa kills. But he is not giving up.

Mr. Watson has been widely criti-

I;

cized in Canada for becoming an “en«
vironmental terrorist,” as he was de-'
scribed not long ago .in a leaked
memorandum from the Royal Cana-
dian Mounted Police. But on the wolf

‘ issue, as on other ecological matters;

his arguments, if not always his
words, seemed more carefully
weighed. With an associate, Robert
Hunter, he recently wrote a l30-page
book on the British Columbia wolf
kills, “Cry Wolf!”

But, at bottom, the controversy‘
seems rooted in differing perceptions
of the wolf.

“There’s not a single case in North
American history that I’ve come
across of a wolf attacking a human

,being, ” Mr. Watson said. “It’ 5 always

the other way round.”

Mr. Rogers, the Environment
Minister, disagreed. Having wit~-
nessed a wolf pack descending onf
caribou from the vantage point of a
helicopter, he said, he was shaken by
the savagery. “if there’s a foundation
in New York that would like me to"
tranquilize half a dozen of these ani-
mals and send them to Central Park,

. I’ll be happy to do so,” he said. “After

a day or two I’m darned sure there

'wouldn’ t be too many people to take

their case. ”

87 ROBERT KA NIGEL

 

no name, not even, as yet, a number.

He was only a weight — part of an
order for 30 male laboratory rats, weighing
between 275 and 300 grams, destined for the
psychology department at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.

It was Sept. 17, 1985. A moment before,
in a hygienically sealed room at Charles
River Laboratories, north of Boston, a
white-coated technician had weighed him,
checked his sex and tossed him down the
open chute onto a soft wood-chip bedding.
Now a packer picked him up and loaded
him, with nine other rats, into a cardboard
carton with mesh-covered vents on its tap
and sides. Soon the carton would be loaded,
with hundreds of others, into a climate-con-
trolled tractor trailer that, later that morn-
ing, would roll south toward Baltimore.

At Johns Hopkins, the rat would have a
tiny, precisely demarcated region of his
brain chemically destroyed, to simulate
memory loss suffered by human victims of
Alzheimer‘s disease. Then he would be in
jected with a chemical that might, it was
thought, reverse the loss. To see if it would,
scientists would run him through a maze
designed to test his short -term memory. Ulti-
mately. he would be deco Dilated and his

D own the metal chute he slid. He had

that Uill‘.‘ med his daily care oral our
geryu, maze performance and death, he
would be identified as No. 1913.

The future No. 1913 belonged to a strain
of rats known as Long-Evans hooded. The
strain dates to 1915, when Joseph Abraham
Long, a professor of embryology at the Uni-
versity of California at Berkeley, trapped a
wild Norwegian gray rat on the banks of the
campus' Strawberry Creek Long and Her-
bert McLean Evans, another Berkeley biolo-
gist, crossed the Norwegian gray with a stan-
dard white laboratory rat from a line first
established at the Wistar Institute in Phila-
delphia in 1909. The resultant hooded rat has
a black head and a black streak that trails
down its otherwise white back in irregular
bands and blotches as distinctive as finger-
prints; ,

Charles River Laboratories established
its own Long-Evans colony in 1978. A preg-
nant rat was killed just before she was about
to deliver her brood, and her intact uterus
was placed in an isolation unit to ensure that
the pups would be born in a sterile environ
ment. Tet unit-sens reaching into the incuba
tor through surgical gloves attached to rub-
ber sleeves, separated the fetuses and
massaged them into life. About 30 genera-
tions later, during the week of July 7, 1985, a
direct descendant of that caesarean-born lit-
ter gave birth to No. 1913 and about a dozen
brothers and sisters.

Some of 1913‘s sisters were collected in
stainless steel containers, asphyxiated with
carbon dioxide and discarded; female lab

rats are less in demand than males because-

their four- to five-day estrus cycles are
viewed as a liability by researchers trying to
tightly control experimental variables. No.
1913 and the other pups allowed to live were
taken from their mothers and divided ran-
domly among females for nursing, about 10
pups to each, to achieve uniform weaning
weights. Ten days after birth, 1913 opened

 

Robert Kanigel, a Baltimore-based science writer,
lot/owed rat No. I913 for five months to research this
article, which originaliy appeared in The Sciences
magazine. His book, ‘Apprenh'ce to Genius: The Malt-
ing of a Scientiﬁc Dynasty, ’ about prominent scientists
and their mentors, was published by Macmillan last
September.

his eyes for the first time; 11 days later,
weighing 40 grams, he was weaned, and he
joined the rest of the colony.

He lived in barrier room 64, one of the
laboratories' dozens of climatecontrolled
breeding rooms, which was kept at a con-
stant temperature of 74° Fahrenheit and at
a relative humidity of 55 percent. His food —
a 22% percent protein mix of vitamin- and
mineral-enriched natural grains and cereals
— was always sterilized. So were the hard-
wood chips that were his bedding; when
soiled, they were whisked away to an incin-
erator through a pneumatic tube. The
breeding rooms, with their elaborate sanitiz-
ing and air-handling systems, cost four times
as much a square foot to construct as new
housing for humans. The systems were de-
signed not to keep the rooms germ-free but

 

to maintain a specific, monitored mix of
microorganisms in the rats’ guts to discour-
age infection by pathogenic organisms.

The halfdozen or sohumans who fed
and watered 1913, and cleaned his cage,
clocked in for work each day in an insecti-
cide-treated outer room of the cinder block
building. In another room, they removed
their clothes and stored them in a locker.
Then they showered, shampooed their hair
and scrubbed their eyeglasses. In a fourth
chamber, they donned coats, caps and the
first of several sets of masks and gloves they
would wear during a typical day. Only then
could they enter the barrier room.

Occasionally, the caretakers adopted as
a pet one or another of the barrier room's

thousands of rats, and it would perch on one '

of their shoulders as they carried out their
work. But 1913 probably was handled little
in the early weeks of his life — when he was
weighed and perhaps when his cage was
cleaned. Only after the humans left for the
day and the lights went out did his environ-
ment grow lively, as the rats, nocturnal by ,
nature, began rustling about their cages. A ‘
din filled the air while a handful of rats,
escaped from their cages and, clinging to
the dark-blue baseboard, darted across the
concrete floor.

On September 4, Charles River Labora-
tories received the order for 30 Long-Evans
rats at $8.93 each from laboratory technician
Brenda Cribbs at Johns Hopkins. The billing
information was keyed in to a computer; a
purchase-order number, 550900439X, was
assigned to it, and a shipping label prepared.
Thirteen days later, No. 1913 left the only
home he had ever known.

, bout 9:30 in the morning on Septem-
_ ber 18, in Ames Hall on the Johns
Hopkins Homewood campus, Bren-
da Cribbs pried thick staples from the lid of
:1 Charles River carton. Suddenly bathed in
light, the 10 rats inside huddled in a quiver-
ing mound. Their bedding was still relative-
ly fresh, their food only partly consumed.
Cribbs opened the other two cartons. Then,
assisted by several undergraduates, she '
picked up the rats, carried them into the
”tftl f0?" 3*" ““1529,

yellow stickers numbered 1902 h. 190..

One cage was assigned to rats 1912 and
1918 For a few moments they lay almost
still, nestled together in a corner. But soon
they began exploring. One licked at the
spring-loaded valve at the back of the cage
that released drinking water from a plastic
tank. The other grasped a food pellet — a
pale lump the consistency of particle board
-— and began gnawing away, elbows resting
on the floor of the cage, forearms bent to his
mouth

The two front teeth of the newly deliv-
ered rats were large and yellow — sturdy
triangular wedges that descended about
half an inch into their jaws. The claws with
which they gripped the wire mesh were
perfect translucent crescents, each like a
miniature of an eagle‘s beak. Their coats
were spotlessly clean, their eyes black and
bulbous. At a sudden noise, they would dart
to the back of the cage with breathtaking
speed. They were impressive animals.

After a night in their new cages. the rats.
had their first experience with regular hu-
man handling. Steve Gallo, one of the under-
graduate “ratrunners” who helped out
around the lab for academic credit or for
pay, took 1912 and 1913 out to the hall to a
waisthigh handling pen about the size of a .
large game board. While 1912 prowled on his ‘
own, Gallo picked up 1913, stroked him,
kneaded his shoulders and let him crawl
over his hands and wrists. Sometimes Gallo
would treat him to an “elevator ride" in
which he would lift and lower the rat

straight up and down. To get the animals

accustomed to noise, he clapped his hands
and tapped the wooden sides of the pen. The
goal was to teach the rats, which naturally
preferred close quarters, to be comfortable
in mazelike open spaces and to trust their
human handlers.

room down the hall from the animal ‘

Four days later, in a small, windowless

room, 1913‘s head lay immobile in a
horseshoe-shaped apparatus of polished
steel. Two rods had been inserted into his
ear cavities, and a steel harness held his
upper jaw in place. Pentobarhital, an anes-

thetic, coursed through his veins. A flood
lamp bathed his limp body, keeping it warm
(pentobarbital disrupts normal temperature
regulation). The top of his head had been
shorn smooth with an electric clipper. Now,
Brenda Cribbs prepared to drill through
19135 skull and down to his soft brain.

No. 1913‘s brain was being altered to
simulate the effects of Alzheimer’s disease,
which begins with impairment of short-term
memory and leads to severe dementia Rats
do not get Alzheimer’s, but they share with
humans a basal forebrain that autopsies of
Alzheimer's victims invariably reveal as de
teriorated Earlier that summer, three Johns
Hopkins psychologists — professor David
Olton, associate research scientist Gary
Wenk and postdoctoral student Donna
Hughey — had found that chemically de-
stroying two regions of a rat’s basal fore-
brain (the nucleus basalis magnocellularis
and the medial septa] area) caused a pattern
of memory impairmwt similar to that seen
in Alzheimer’s patients Now, with 1913 and
the 29 other Charles River rats, they hoped
to see whether the effects of those lesions
could be reversed by treatment with a com-
pound called GM. .

Destroying the tiny bits of basal fore-
brain was painstaking work. Earlier that
morning, Cribbs had wheeled to the surgery
room a primitive wooden dolly that bore
three cages and six rats — her quota for the
day. Having completed the operation on one
pair of rats, she turned to 1912 and 1913.
Blowing gently on their faces 'to calm them,
she weighed each animal on a doubleheam
balance. Then she injected them with atro-
pine — a drug that dries up’ the salivary
gland — to ensure that the anesthetized rats
would not choke on their own saliva Finally,
she gave each animal a dose of pentobarbi-
tal, based on its body weight - '

Within a few minutes, 1913 lay still. But
1912‘s whiskers were still twitching, and his
muscles trembled periodically. Cribbs in-
jected him with a pentobarbital booster

equal to 25 percent of the original dose. At,

first it seemed enough. But then, the heads
of both animals locked into adjacent steel
harnesses and ready for surgery, she saw
that 1912 was again twitching. Setting the
dosage of anesthetic is tricky; too much can
be dangerous, but too little can subject the
animal to unnecessary pain. Cribbs gave the
rat a second booster. Waiting about a min-
ute, she gripped the scalpel and made a
quick, clean incision along the midline of his
shaved head. The animal squealed.

Now, with surgical retractors holding
back folds of furry skin and underlying tis-
sue, and a gauze pad staunching the tiny
pool of blood, Cribbs had before her an
inchiong diamond-shaped section of 1912’s
pale-white skull. In the center, clearly visi-
ble, was the bregma point —— the juncture of
two seamlike joints she would use as a refer-
ence point. Turning fine micrometer adjust-
ing screws, she cranked the tip of a needle a
preset distance up and over from the breg-
ma point, used a felt-tipped pen to mark the
spot on the surface of the skull, swung the
needle back out of the way and, with an
electric drill, punctured the skull. No. 1912
squirmed, his claws scratching audibly
across the paper toweling on which he lay.
Cribbs repeated the procedure at two other
points on 1912’s brain, then all over again on
1913's.

At each drill site, she prepared to inject
ibotenic acid — or ibo, as it was known
around the lab - a compound found in

poisonous mushrooms that causes nerve
cells to fire uncontrollably until they die.
She was aiming for three regions buried
deep within the brain, each smaller than
half a grain of rice. At each spot - or what
her measurements, calculations and surgi-
cal experience told her were the right sites.
for she could not actually see them — she
delivered four tiny squirts of ibo. Finally,
she threaded a curved sewing needle with
black silk thread and, with five or six quick

looping stitches, sutured the head wounds.
7 ‘ Before Cribbs laid the rats back in their .

cages to recuperate under a warming lamp,
she crimped a metal number tag through
the thin, translucent tissue of each of their
left ears. Until then, the two animals had
been assigned the numbers 1912 and 1913,
but there had been no reason to say which
rat was which. Only now did Cribbs desig-
nate the rat with splotchy markings 1913
and the other, with a neat ruled band down

'his back,1912. For the first time, the fates of

the two animals diverged.

t a quarter to 9 the next morning,
Cribbs went into the laboratory and
found 1912 lying curled up in his
cage, dead. He was still warm to the touch,
and one paw was bloody. She placed him in a
plastic garbage bag, which was labeled with
the yellow identification sticker she peeled
off his cage, and carried him down the hall

to room 137C. There, she deposited him in a ,

large freezer. A few days later, he would be
taken to the incinerator and burned The
researchers speculated that he might have
died from an overdose of anesthetic. 0r per-
haps the ibo had seeped into the fourth
ventricle, which lies beside the medulla ob-
longata, the area of the brain that controls
breathing and other vital functions

Most of the other rats woke up no worse
for their surgery. Later that morning, 10 of
them received the first in a two-week series
of GM. injections Fortunately, only a few
grains of the white powder were needed in
each syringe; a two-gram vial of GM costs
$20,000. The substance, which Gary Weak
had persuaded an Italian supplier to donate
to the laboratory, is one of more than 40
compounds known as gangliosides, found
naturally in the human brain and extracted
for pharmaceutical purposes from the
brains of cows

How the mammalian brain wires itself
— how it grows new nerve cells and how
they branch out and connect to form cir-
cuits - is poorly understood. Gangliosides,
discovered 50 years ago, are thought to be
flags, located on the membranes of nerve
cells, that tell other, approaching cells, “I’m
a norepinephrine cell," or "I’m acetylcho—
line." Drug companies are said to be explor-
ing the potential of these compounds for
repairing brain damage. Gary Wenk found

 

 

 

‘gTv‘en tiny lesions in its still-plastic brain was
an imperfect model, at best, for an older
human, with a rigid brain, suffering wide-
spread defects. Still, if GM‘ could make
these rats more normal, it might serve as a
starting point for the treatment of humans
-- and help illuminate fundamental brain

‘ processes along the way. The potential pay-

offs were great, even if the chances of suc-
cess were slim

it intriguing that, in other laboratories,
when brain-lesioned rats were given GM. ,
their performance on a simple passive-
avoidance test — a' general test of brain
functioning -- improved. Was it possible, he
wondered, that GM. could reverse memory
loss in rats with Alzheimer‘slike brain le
sions? It was a long shot, certainly. And he
realized that, even if it worked, a young rat

'Nenty rats would receive lesions. Half
of these would then get GM, and half a saline
solution (a placebo). In addition, a control
group of 10 rats would undergo the same
surgery as the lesioned rats but would not
receive injections of ibo and, thus, would be
left essentially normal. Finally, all 30 rats
would be run repeatedly through a maze
and the performance of the three groups

 

compared.

In a large ramshackle room, off in a
corner, 1913 stood before a homemade con-
traption of black wood. It was called a maze,
but it was really just a yardlong runway
with a T intersection at the end. The whole
thing was perched atop three thick rolls of
paper to discourage 1913 from jumping
down. At the start of the maze, a door slid

' open vertically, like a guillotine, to admit

the rat. After traveling the length of the
stem, he would pass through a cheesecloth
curtain and arrive at the T. At the end of

each arm was a shallow recess, one of which

contained a pellet of Thrive, a commercial
animal food. To get it, the rat had only to
choose the correct arm.

Getting the pellet mattered to 1913. Like
the other rats, he was being underfed. Each
day, the ratrunners gave him just enough
food pellets to keep him sufficiently hungry
to seek food in the maze yet not so hungry as
to become listless or ill. Keeping him at
about 85 percent of normal body weight
would do that. .

, No. 1913 had been introduced to the
maze a week earlier. At first, he was placed
'on the runway, over which had been scat-
tered dozens of colored bits of Thrive, which
he could nibble freely. During succeeding
days, the Thrive had been pushed down the

 

 

 

 




 

 

runway, past the cheesecloth curtain, and
back into the arms. By the fifth day, 1913
had learned to scurry down the runway to
the T intersection, and down either arm to
the food. But today when he arrived at the T,
his entry to the right arm was barred by a
4by-4-inch block of wood (on which some
one, in a flight of fancy, had painted a Stop
sign). The rat turned left and found his ac-
customed morsel. -

He was then placed back behind the ‘

guillotine door. The door slid open, and he
scurried down the runway. This time, the
block was gone, and 1913 could choose either
arm. He turned right, and found a food
pellet.

He was put at the door of the maze a
third time. Once more it opened, and he
darted down the runway and turned right,
but there was no food.

That was all for the day; the experi-
menters did not want to tax the rats. Gradu-
ally, the animals would work their way up
from three runs a day to five, then seven,
and soon, to a greater or lesser extent, they
would come to learn the nature of the task
— the trick for getting food. it was an alter—
nationcontingency task, an established test
of short-term memory, on which, for the
rest of his life, 1913 would be tried. Almost
daily for four months, a ratrunner would

 

load up a wooden dolly with four cages,
including the one 1913 now shared with
1903, and wheel it down the hall, through
double doors, to room 127A. On an initial
run, the wooden block in place, 1913 would
be forced to take one arm; on succeeding
runs, the block removed, he had to choose,
but would find food only if he went down
the arm opposite the one he had taken on

over several days and then compared with
the performances of the lesion and the con-
trol groups.

ne afternoon in late October, the
researchers gathered in Donna
Hughey’s office for their first seri-
ous review 0f the data. Hughey was puzzled.
The rats had been making 10 runs each day
for 152 days. and still no difference in perfor-
mance had emerged between the three
groups. - -

Two weeks passed, and still no differ
ences appeared. On the door to David Ol-
ton's office was taped, a cartoon in which a
bedraggled rat on crutches, one arm in a
sling, is introduced to a self-assured rat with
a cigaret dangling rakishly from the corner
of its mouth. “Harry of the Test Group," says
rat,_“meet Murray of the Control
Group." _ , . . .

ment the harrys leaked no worse than the
Murray‘s — a snag that set the researchers to
finetuning the experiment in the hope of
resurrecting the performance differences
between lesioned and unlesioned rats that
they had discovered the previous summer.

A few days later, 1913's maze routine
underwent a change. At 496 in the after-
noon, he was taken from the maze after a
single run and placed back in the cage.
Then, at 4:09, after three other rats had each
made a run, he was put in the maze once
more.

As before, the food was in the arm oppo-
site the one where it had been placed for his
preceding run. But now, 1913 had to remem-
ber which arm that had been -- not for just
15 seconds but for the three minutes or so it
had taken the other rats to run the maze.
The idea was that if the lesions had caused
any memory differences between the
groups, this new, tougher test ought to high-
light them. '

Encouraged by their experience the
previous summer, when a four-rat delay
seemed to bring out the differences most
dramatically, Hughey moved the rats quick-
ly through delays of one, two and three rats.
It was a mistake, the researchers agreed
later; the change was too abrupt. Perfor-
mance for all three groups plummeted (of-
ten the rats’ choices were no better than
chance), which submerged, rather than en-
hanced, the differences between them.

By December, David Olton and his team
were bewildered. What had gone wrong?
Were the control rats just unusually bad
mazerunners? Had the weights of the rats
not been kept low enough to properly moti-
vate them in the mazes? Or had the lesions
failed to take? Perhaps it had been a bad
batch of ibotenic acid. Or maybe, though it

memory loss and leads to severe dementia.

 

over perhaps 15 or 20 seconds, which arm
that was.

Ten “free choice" runs constituted
1913's daily contribution to a treatment for
Alzheimer‘s disease. Ten correct choices
meant mastery; five — no better than

chance -— suggested memory impairment.

No. 1913’s performance was averaged with
that of all the other rats in the GM; group

"had been three years since postmortems had

found a flaw in Cribb’s surgical techniques,
the injections had been misdirected.

It would be impossible to know for cer-
tain until the experiment was over and the
rats' brains could be autopsied. In the mean-
time, as a last resort, they decided to go back
to a zero delay and increase it gradually
until differences in performance emerged.

Unfortunately, in the current experl- ~

At first there were no differences.
Then, one day, using a one-rat delay, the
control rats averaged 7.5 correct choices and
the lesioned rats 6.4. The next day. it was 7.6
for the controls and 7.1 for the lesioned, and
on the third day, 8.9 and 7.4. “Small and
unimpressive,” the researchers dubbed the
data spread, yet week after week it per-
sisted. .

,GM. , however, never did work. For
months, the researchers held out hope, rea-
soning that maybe the ganglioside should
have no impact on performance until the
neural pathways it was helping construct
wereacompleted, just as a bridge carries no
trafficuntil construction is completed. Yet
weeks after the lesion effect had been estab
lished, GM. showed no signs of reversing it.

‘ At least in this experiment, for the type of
. short-term memory tested, at the particular
'_ dosage used, GM; offered no miracle cure

forAlzheimer’s. » . .
‘ Yet the researchers could not conclude

‘ that GM. was useless. Perhaps, if they had

given it in higher or lower doses, the results
would have been different. Research sug-
gesting that GM. holds promise had been
based on experiments involving complete
physical destruction of brain tissue, whereas
their lesions had been made chemically, kill-
ing only the cell body, not the surrounding
tissue. Perhaps, Wenk speculated, it is only
such physical destruction — like that found
in autopsied Alzheimer’s patients — that
triggers brain defenses, including the re-
lease of, and heightened sensitivity to, gain
gliosidea

n February 4, a folded paper towel
0 bearing a message scrawled in pen-

cil was taped to a wall in the animal
room. It read:

19031933
GM, 5 ARE NOW ON F REE FOOD

The rats in the GM. experiment, the
note was saying, no longer had to be kept
hungry. The experiment, as far as they were
concerned, was over.

Three days later, 1913, 1903 and the oc-
cupants of three other cages were wheeled
out of the animal room. Instead of turning
right, toward the maze room, they went
straight, then left, down a short, narrow
hall, where their dolly was parked outside a
room they had never seen. ‘

Then everything went quickly. Brenda
Cribhs put on a chain mail glove, reached
into the cage, picked up 1913, placed his
head in a trapezoidal slot formed by two
opposing steel blades, and pressed down on
a long lever that forced the blades to slide
shut, through his neck. She tossed the head-
less body into a garbage bag, within which,
for some seconds, it fIOpped and wriggled.

The furry stump of 1913’s head lay mo-
tionless on a paper towel at the base of the
blade, its black, bulbous eyes staring. Cribs
picked it up and carried it to an adjacent
bench. There, Gary Wenk took a hefty wire
cutter-like tool called a bone chipper and
cracked the rat’s skull; it sounded like a
lobster being pried open. He extracted the
animal's brain and laid it atop a thick slab of
steel sitting in crushed ice; the rest of the
head be discarded. Working carefully with a
scalpel, be sliced out the hippocampus and
the cortex and put each in a tiny glass vial, to
be checked later for enzyme levels indica-
tive of a properly placed lesion. Then be
inserted into a larger vial the rest of the
brain, including the basal forebrain, which
would be frozen, sliced and examined under
a microscope.

No. 1913 was dead. But his brain had yet
more secrets to reveal. I

Crusader
against
crime

By Pat Gordon
Stan Writer of The News

Carole Young never gave much
thought to crime. If she did, it was
only a passing thought that it al-
ways happened to someone else.

But on a sunny July day in 1980,
her views toward crime changed
forever.

On that day, she stopped by a
North Dallas mall to run an errand.
Seconds after returning to her car,
she became a crime victim. :-

A young man pressed a knife
against her throat and, as he shoved
her inside the car, warned: “Doas I

She fought him, but her strength

. "And they were true bull terrier
lovers. Now we get at least one or
. two a day. We have to special order
them. and when they come in they
go fast. There are so many requests
. it’s absolutely crazy."
_ Ms. Draganslti. in fact. is waiting
on her own bull terrier. But she
. notes. she s not a Spuds-come~lately;
; she fell in love with the breed about
. three years ago. and says she'll defi-
niteiy have her dog by the end of
.March.
' "The dog just matches my per-
. sonaiity and my boyfriend's person-
ality.” she says. “They're just a to-
.tally radical dog. They've got a per-
‘sonality all their own. They' re a
very humorous dog — they really
L. are. "

But. she says. many of the new
Spuds lovers don't know that -- or
anything else about the breed. _

"They come in and say. 'i want

L one like Spuds.’ or. “i want a Patton
i dog.’ (Gen. George S. Patton owned
;a bull terrier named Willie) and
‘.they have no idea about the dog."
: says Ms. Draganski. .

And that. say seasoned aficiona.
i. dos of bull terrier. is exactly the

.problem. Yes. there are piuses' to
Spudsmania — for one thing. it has
helped to offset the widely held
(though false) belief that bull ter-
riers and pit bulls are one in the
same breed. And. yes. despite those
nasty rumors that Spuds is actually

a female dog. the commercials are
cute. (The rumors. by the by, ap-
pear to be groundless. Spuds
appeared at the Irish Fest in Dallas
over the weekend. and the dog was
definitely a male.)

But the boom in popularity. they
say. could adversely affect the
breed.

"1 have very mixed feelings
about it,” says Steve Schmidt. past

president of the Bull Terrier Club

of America and a breeder for 18
years. “The same thing happened
when the movie Big Red came out
— all of a sudden everyone wanted
an Irish setter. and soon the shel-
ters were full of lrish setters. Also.
when you get a burst of interest like
this. you get a lot of people involved
in breeding the animal that aren't
really qualified to do so."

Schmidt has heard the cries of
“Hey. is that Spuds MacKenzie?"
when taking his bull terriers -
Burleigh and Sizzles — out for a
stroll. and he loves the fact that
Spuds is portrayed as a jaunty. fun-
loving pooch.

Schmidt breeds one to three
litters per year. or about is to 21
bull terrier pups. He says he has
gone from “one call a week to one
call a day" for the pups. which sell
for around $400 to SSOOeach.

The onset of Spudsmania.
though. has meant that a lot of peo-
ple may be buying a bull terrier
without knowing what they‘re get»

‘ ting.

 

scrappy." he says. “You just don't let
them run around the neighbor-
hood. And if someone wants a ‘ma-
cho' dog to ride in the back of their
pickup truck. and they call me. they
don't get a dog. And they're very
bad mothers - they need round-
the-clock supervision after they’ve
had puppies. because they're so
clumsy you have to make sure the
mom doesn't squash. step on or in-
jure the puppies. "

Also he says “bull terriers have
it: haves fenced-in yard. and should
only be allowed out on a leash. And
they should never be in a house
with another dog of the same sex. i
wouldn't sell someone a bull terrier
for $50,000 if that person had an-
other dog of the same sex in the
home. They might get along for a
while. but they'll end up having
problems."

Bob Robertson. president of the I

Bull Terrier Club of Dallas. is even

more concerned by the trend to ' .

buying bull terriers. A breeder for
11 years. he has received “25 or 30"
caiis since early December. many
more than last winter. Most of these
people. he says. are “impulse
buyers."

"People.” he says. “see this cute
dog and say. 'l've got to have one.’
and they get one and it starts chew-
ing up stuff. and all of a sudden the
dog is back with the breeder. and
the people have a negative feeling
about the breed. it's a cute commer-
cial. but it starts a vicious cycle."

Florida tries to sa

HOMOSASSA SPRINGS. Fla. — . Pat-
rick Rose didn’t quite know what to do
about the frisky manatee.

It was a couple of years ago, and
Rose, a marine-mammal expert, was tak-
ing pictures of a manatee herd beneath
the sparkling surface of Florida’s Blue
Springs. But the lone manatee was irre-
pressible. It was trying to hog the photo
session.

Rose would aim his lens toward other
manatee subjects. The playful creature
would use its flippers to wrestle him be-
neath the water.

, Finally, the photographer managed to
dodge the pesky manatee. He sank to the
floor of the spring and prepared to shoot
pictures of the nearby herd.
. “All of a sudden, something slammed
into my back," Rose recalls, laughing.

It was the good-time manatee“ striking

once again.

Christopher Columbus thought they
were mermaids, but one close-range
glimpse quickly dispells any such notion.

Their admirers have struggled for
words to describe them, from “sea-going
overstuffed sofas” to “giant floating Idaho
potatoes” and even “a cross between E.T.
and the elephant man.”

tees have quietly cruised the state’s shal-

PATRICK ROSE/ Special

ENDANGERED: Manatees have only one real enemy, humans in speedboats.

low coastal waters, rivers and springs for
eons. But in the last few decades, the gen-
tle seafaring mammals have risen to ce-
lebrity status as their numbers lessen and
their only real enemy, humans in speed-
boats, continues to grow.

Last year, 33 of the 122 manatees that

died in Florida were killed in boat and

barge collisions, and in the past three
)4

years, boat-related manatee deaths have
increased 80 percent during the previous
seven years. '

Researchers estimate that as many as
70 rcent of the 1,200 manatees surviving
in lorida wear the scars of outboard-mo-
tor propellers despite the fact that warn-
ing signs are posted for boaters throughout

many east- and west-coast recreational

anatees frOm boaters ~

waterways.

“There are just too many boats and
too many people,” says Dr. Jesse White, a
manatee researcher and veterinarian with
the Florida Department of Natural Re-
sources (DNR). “We are not owners of
these waters. We are only guardians. We
are only one resident on this planet.”

Manatees, also called sea cows, have
been in Florida for some 60 million years.
They share a common ancestor with the
elephant and are believed to have evolved
from a wading, plant-eating animal.

They are trusting and curious. They
weigh from a half ton to 3,000 pounds, but
the wouldn’t know how to be aggressive
if t ey tried.

In an attempt to save manatees from
boat prOpellers, the DNR this year has
drafted a protection plan that would limit
even further the freedom of boaters and
water-skiers on. Florida waterways.

Though the free—ranging manatees some-

times swim north to the Carolinas and
west to Louisiana in the summer, they
find winter sanctuary in warm Florida
waters. .

The state, by working with counties
that are heavily populated by manatees,
aims to control more carefully the number
of boat docks, create slower speed zones
in shallow waters frequented by manatees,
regulate the location of new marinas and

require posting of educational signs
that warn boaters of the harm they
can inflict on manatees.

Says photographer Rose, who is
DNR’s marine-mammal coordinator:
“1 think we can provide for quality
boating and manatee protection if
peOple will take the time to hear
the whole story.”

 

But boaters and skiers in some

Florida communities already are up
in arms over the plan.
“We are real upset about this

whole thing,” says Barbara McCoy,

president of the Spaceland Water
Ski Club in Merritt Island. “They
are being too protective. The mana-
tees are going to be happy, but
what about all the people who are
living here?”

About 80 people belong to the
ski club, which uses Sykes Creek,
near Cape Canaveral, for skiing ac-
tivities once a week.

“There are boats out there that
enjoy going fast and really aren’t as
careful as they should be,” Mrs. Mc-
Coy admits “They just like to ch0p
the water up But we’ re real safety
conscious.

Her husband, Dave, worries that
officials eventually “will shut down
all 72 miles of waterway in Brevard
County” to protect manatees.

Though Brevard County Com-
missioner Thad Altman agrees
many boaters “have a great deal of
compassion for the manatee,” he
worries about the vocal, “almost
militant” faction of insensitive boat-
ers that simply isn’t concerned
about the endangered critters.

A Brevard bumper sticker spot-
ted by a friend of Altman’s advised:
“Clean up our waterways. Kill a
manatee.”

“Anybody who could brutalize-

such a docile species would not be
very sensitive to begin with,” Alt-
man says. “It scares me.”
*3! t
Manatees have been protected
for years by the federal and state

 

 

 

 

WARNING: Boaters don i
always heed signs.

' governments, and legislation has es-

tablished 20 manatee sanctuaries on
Florida’s east and west coasts.

The US. Fish and Wildlife Ser-
vice Conducts aerial surveys to
track the mammals.

In 1981, then—Gov. Bob Graham
joined singer-songwriter Jimmy
Buffet to establish a Save the Mana-
tee Committee to name the mana-
tee Florida’s official marine mam-
mal and to alert the public of the
manatee’s plight.

In Orlando, 3 Save the Manatee
Club sponsored by the DNR and the
Florida Audubon Society gives v01-
unteers a chance to participate in
manatee conservation efforts.

But the way Altman sees it, this
year’s county-wide planning to cut

'down on boat-related manatee

deaths is a turning point crucial to
providing a safe habitat for the
creatures around the state.

“This is probably the beginning

of the battle to save the manatee,”

he says.

For Jesse White, the battle be-
gan in 1969 when be rescued a way-
ward manatee from a Fort Lauder-
dale storm sewer. White, then a
veterinarian with the Miami Sea—
quarium, transported the half-ton,
half-dead animal to his treatment
facility. The manatee recuperated in

.a tank with the Seaquarium’s resi-

dent manatees, Romeo and Juliet,
before being released back into the

wild. He became known as Sewer *

Sam. '

Since then, White has concen-
trated on studying manatee behav-
ior and nutrition, as well as con-
ducting the only captive manatee
breeding program. ' Last March, he
oversaw the release of two captive-
born manatees, Sunrise and Savan-
nah, into the Homosassa River.

But there has been no sign of
the manatees since the radio trans-
mitter assembly that had been at-
tached to Sunrise’s spatulalike tail
was recovered and the damaged
transmitter that had been worn by
Savannah was found. .

“I’m just Optimistic enough to
think that we’re going to see them
again,” says White, who works out
of his west coast DNR office at Na-
ture World in Homosassa, where

visitors can watch captive manatees,

swim in the springs through an un-
derwater viewing station. -

White, 52, is a bearded bear of
a man who has spent much time an
derwater with the creatures, and he
has written for National Geographic
magazine about his manatee studies.

Nearly every week, he surveys
manatees at Homosassa Springs and
on the Crystal River, where warm
waters that feed the Gulf north of
Tampa are attractive to manatees
in winter and where tourists and
divers flock to see the mysterious

mammals.

Now, White’s skiff idles on the

waterway and he points to a mana-

tee when it surfaces for ‘air. A man .

and woman cruise past in their fish-
ing boat, trying to escape a group
of manatees that’s been playing
with their boat’s anchor line.

“They just won’t let us alone
over there,” the man says.

Responds White: “They’re very
curious critters.”

And though divers are warned
not to harass manatees, “there are

manatees that you can’t get away'

from,” he says. “They want to come
up and get in your face mask.”

But it’s their natural Curiosity
that also can get manatees into big
trouble with high-powered boats

“The numbers [of manatees] are '

at the point where there’s no ques-
tion they’re going to be declining if
we don’t control the factors that are

at work right now,” Rose says. “We'

have more boats, and I think, also,
we have more pe0ple using their
boats now. There’s going to come a
day when there’s not enough habitat
to sustain them.”

Because of heavy development,
the shallow grassbeds where mana-
tees roam have been diminished by
30 percent in the last 40 years,

‘ ‘ Rose says.

Should the state suffer one cata-
strephic” winter or the sea be pollut-
ed by a bad outbreak of red, tide,
the manatee population could be
devastated, he says. Many die of the

warm waters, and in 1982, 40 man-
atees were killed by. complications
following a red-tide outbreak in the
Fort Myers area. .

“There’s been so much attention
over the past 10 years on the mana-
tee,” says Commissioner Altman.
“But what’s important now is that,
if we don’t get behind the elected
officials who are wanting to take
some tough political stands to save
the manatee, all that will be for

naught.” . I .‘

PARACAS. on the eerie and
beautiful Pacific coast of
Peru, is one of the finest and
most delicate wildlife reserves
in the southern hemisphere.
It is also about to be carved
up in the name of money.

Politicians, tourist op-
erators, fishing companies
and even escaped criminals
are despoiling the isolated
paradise at a pace which
threatens to create a wilder-
ness, littered with lawless
clap-board shanty towns and
cheap hotels.

Even the man who did most
to set up the Paracas reserve
15 years ago is in such
despair over its fate he is
backing a plan to cut it in
half, wiping out the sanc-
tuaries of a multitude of
penguins, sealions and mi-
grating birds.

rmw can: you have a,
wildlife reserve with a brothel
in the middle, and where
ornithologists and other vis-
itors are liable to be
mugged?” asked Felipe
Benavides, a ﬁercely-indepen-

 

remainder. But Peru’s
conservationists are solidly
against him; they say
Benavides, 69, is the unwit-
ting tool of local developers
and shadowy business in-
terests.

They are trying to raise the
alarm in Britain and America
to save Paracas, and are
appealing to international
protection bodies for help.

Alfredo Ferreyros, the head
of one of South America’s
biggest adventure tour com-
panies, warned: “A tragedy
must be avoided. If Paracas
isn't saved, wildlife reserves
all over the Third World will
face new threats from the
developers.”

Paracas is 1,000 miles from
the Galapagos Islands on a
stretch of coastai desert. i4
degrees south of the equator.
It juts out from the foothilis
of the Andes into the icy

cold water and tropical photo-
synthesis produces one of the
world‘s most startling spec-
tacles — a vast, thriving
homeland and migration
point for millions of birds.

Some come from the Arctic
and the Antarctic, others
from the Andes and the
Amazon Basin, attracted to
the isolation, burning sun,
fierce winds and waters rich
with fish.

Ornithologists have
counted 67 bird varieties at
Paracas, many of them rare.
The Andean condor, the
largest bird in the world,

glide down 15,000ft and more
from high in the Andes to
feed on the carcasses of
sealions which popuiate the
isolated promontories and
small islands of the reserve.

This area is also of great
archeological importance. For
thousands of years Paracas
was the centre of one of the
most sophisticated ancient
cultures in all the Americas.-

To the south are the
mysterious Nazca lines, a
huge maze of 3hr deep
depressions drawn across the
desert, which were found only
40 years ago. Geometrically
straight lines run for several
miles through the arid land-
scape, interspersed with the
giant outlines of dozens of
animals. Archaeologists be-
lieve they are-an astronomical
calendar and map; Erik von
Daniken, popularised them in

 

 

 

 

“Chariots of the Gods” as a
landing station for ﬂying
saucers.

While the mystery of the
Nazca lines and the ancient
myths of the Paracas desert
have long drawn travellers to
this strange region, some ﬁne
beaches and bays sheltered
from the desert winds are now
attracting local and foreign
holidaymakers more in-
terested in water skiing,
scuba diving and wind surfing
than the array of bird and
marine life.

The wild coast has also
attracted fishermen and
divers, backed by ﬁnanciers
in Lima and Miami. Tens of
millions of pounds worth of

 

 

scallops have been ﬂown
to restaurants in Japan, the
United States and France in
recent years. '

Bending to pressure from
the Lima ﬁnanciers, the
Peruvian government broke
its own conservation regula-
tions three years ago and
installed concrete docks in
two ﬁshing villages that had
illegally sprung up in the
reserve. Today more than a
thousand boats are operating
from what are now fully-
fledged ﬁshing ports.

Local politicians, appar-
ently eyeing valuable mining
reserves and tourist potential,
have built a road through the
reserve and quietly pushed a
law through the Peruvian
Senate that will cut Paracas
in half. It now needs oniy to
be nodded through the lower,
house, without a vote, to
become law next month.

Darryl Breaux was a paraplegic
in a near-coma when a small beige

dog was placed on his lap as he sat
:In a hospital wheelchair.

Within minutes, the 21-year-old
man, who had suffered severe
head injuries in a March 18 auto-

“He reached up gently with his

dog,” said Bontke, director of the
head injury program at the the In-

i ' “It. was amazing,” Bontke said. _

“He had done virtually nothing
purposeful until the dog came that
day. He, began to improve after
that and has made good gains.”

RESEARCH POLICY

Goodall going to the public
in bid to better chimps’ lot

QUiCt CffOI'tS t0 pI'Od By Dianne Dumanoski

. . . . Globe Staff

SCIentlsts d1dn t work,

f Cd 11 ane Goodall, who gained fame through National Geo-

am researc 61' says graphic articles, TV specials and her books about
the wild chimpanzees of Tanzania. has resolved to
put her celebrity and scientific clout behind the fight
to improve the care of captive chimps, especially

those used for biomedical research.

Her stand is turning a long-simmering conflict within the
scientific community over the care of laboratory chimpanzees
into a public battle. with biomedical/pharmaceutical research-
ers in one camp and those who study the animals themselves
increasingly in the other.

Goodall. who is exp‘eaed to return to this country late this
month. said in a recent telephone interview from Tanzania
that she had tried quietly. Without success. to push leaders in
the biomedical community llllu improving the situation of cap-
tive chimpanzees. She now plans to take the issue to the pub-
lic. .,

“I wish there were a way of avoiding it," she said, referring
to the confrontation with medical researchers. Goodall said
she had “talked to the top people." who responded that they
”don’t have the money" do make the changes she seeks.

Through lectures, media appearances and her network of
personal contacts. she said, she plans to do all she can to call
attention to captive chimpanzees kept in conditions she con-
siders unacceptable.

“People have said. ‘Whyi are you suddenly launching into .' ,
it?’ I’ve just finished a book "‘Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns ( i d 11 b1 ,
of Behavior"] that took seven years, and this coincided with 00 a. Oln pu 1C

. Goodall’s decision to go public. .
{some observers say, could have a ' '

”.;"-significant impact. Andrew Row-
‘fﬁan. who follows the issue from the
Tufts Veterinary School of Medi-
cine’s Center for Animals, says
that because her "immense credi-
éibility," Goodall’s influence could
jif'ibe “tremendous.”
* Others question her motives
“and those of a committee of scien-
”*tists with whom she is aligned.
Among her critics is Dr. Frederick
'King, who heads the Yerkes Re
gional Primate Research Center in
_ Atlanta. King said he suspects
'Goodall’s real goal “is to eliminate
biomedical research on apes."
Last November Goodall and
about 30 scientists who do non—in-
vasive studies of the animals

 

panzees. It plans to promote the
survival of chimps in the wild and
to improve the lot of those in cap-
tivity. especially chimps in "bio-

.-;medical-pharmaceutical laborato— >

fries where individuals are routine-
,gply stressed and mistreated while

jigserving the medical needs of man-.

33?.kind."

. 7 King, in a recent interview,
I said he is “afraid what lies behind
’ 'this is not simply a desire to see
conditions bettered in laborato-
, ries.” '

. Conservation and Care of Chim- ‘

 

‘The stark, barren
conditions are highly

aging to the apes,
and inevitably cause

ing to despair.’
- Jane Goodall

 

 

several months ago, King ac-
knowledged, he told her the center
lacks money to make major
changes. But. he said, there are
long-range plans “to remodel the
great ape wing, so we can make
the habitat for chimps better."
Yerkes also agreed to allow one of
Goodall’s associates visit the cen-
ter and suggest what might be
done to improve the environment
for chimps in the near term.
. .“The battle is not against the
use of chimpanzees right now,"
Goodall asserts. “It’s to get hu-
mane condit’ions for the chimps
that are being used”, -
Goodall. in the interview. listed
at maximum requirements for
.“chimps being used in the service
_ of humanity” in laboratories: no

, cantly bigger cages. “The mini-

responded, “is keeping animals in
cages. If you want to study dis-
eases. you must have periods of
= time when they are kept in isola-
, tion.”
; Late last month, Goodall fired
an opening shot with an affidavit
condemning conditions at SEMA
lnc.'s Rockville laboratory. which
S were publicized by an under-
ground animal rights group call-
ing itself True Friends. In early
December, the group secretly
made a videotape, removed re-
cords and kidnapped four young

The tape shows chimpanzees
_. rocking back and forth in in isola-

tion chambers the size of shower

“My impression, from viewing
the film,” Goodall said, “is that
they have become insane as a; re-
sult of [these] conditions.”

In attacking SEMA. Goodall is
indirectly taking on the National
Institutes of Health, which isthe
largest source of funding for bio—
meedical research in the nation.
Although SEMA is a private com-
pany, it receives $1.5 million a
year in federal funds to maintain
animals used by NIH staff re-
searchers. Beyond saying that it is
investigating, NIH has declined to "
comment on the charges agaisnt
SEMA. '

Dr.’John Landon. SEMA’s

president, defended conditions at
the lab, asserting that it is ”a su-
perb facility." -
‘ But Goodall insists that the
conditions are “totally unaccepta~
ble. It is my professional opinion
that these apes are not housed
adequately and that the care they
receive seldom complies with the
minimal legal and scientific requr—
iementsc The stark. barren condi-'
tions arehighly psychologically
damaging to the apes, and inevita—
bly cause profound stress leading
to despair." . ‘

One reseachervwho works

7 closely with chimpanzees. veterin—
arian James Mahoney of New
York University’s Laboratory for
Experimental Medicine and Sur-
gery in Primates, says he does not
find Goodall’s minimum demands
“unreasonable." But it may be dif-
ficult, he said. to make majes-

‘physical changes within existing

In some cases, Mahoney said.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, SUNDAY, MARCH 15,1987

WHAT’S NEW IN THE ANIMAL BUSINESS ‘ _

tribute a lot more to society than com-

panionship and food. They sniff for
bombs, gas leaks, 'and drugs; they catch
criminals and serve as eyes for the blind and
ears for the deaf; they rescue earthquake
and avalanche victims. .

' Small wonder, then, that animal lovers are
willing to spend fortunes on keeping their
pets stylish and happy, and that businesses
of all kinds are tyring to capitalize on the
devotion between animals and people.

Indeed, animals have turned out to be ex-
cellent salesmen, showing up in television
and print ads to sell products as obvious as
dog food, and as unexpected as mutual
funds. “A recent marketing study has shown

T HERE is no disputing that animals con-

that people generally regard a product more ,.
positively if there’s an animal associated with‘

it; the pet lends a degree of warmth and lik-
ability," said Katy O’Reilly, a spokeswoman
for the Pets Are Wonderful Council, a Chi-
cago organization that does research into
the pet industry. .-

The use of animals in ads has meant a nice

chunk of revenues for trainers and pet talent

agencies. “More and more calls are coming
in, especially for cats and dogs,” says Carol
McAUliff, vice president of the Animal Theat-
rical Agency in Washington,N.J. The agency
provides animals for films, and for such print
and television ads as the Prudential-Bache
commercial showing a herd of bulls walking
through a crowd of people on Wall Street.
“Animal Theatrical’s business has been dou-
bling annually.” ,

Pet owners, meanwhile, keep moving far-
ther and farther away from the lovable mutt
or stray cat, to the pedigreed highbrow ani—
mal. Animal breeders report that such pure-
bred dogs as Irish setters, golden retrievers
and dobermans, always popular in the United
States, are now selling extraordinarily well in
Japan also. That has meant a thriving export
market for some breeders, although others
are balking at selling their animals out of fear
that Japanese buyers will breed them also,
and turn into competitors.

Unusual animals, especially the more
colorful and exotic birds, also are selling ex:

traordinarily well these days. ”You see peo-
ple today walking around with birds, snakes
and With other animals that will draw atten-
tion to them,” said Brian Kilcommons, an ani-
mal expert and professional dog trainer in
New York. “It’s the exotic that’s in, and the
bird business in particular is taking off and
growing significantly.”

Donald Bruning, curator of birds for the
New York Zoological Society, estimates that
at least 80 percent of all birds sold in the
United States last year, including many of the
exotic macaws, cockateels, and parrots,
were bred domestically. Five or six years
ago, he says, the figure was probably no
more than half.

More people are also getting into the busi-
ness of manufacturing expensive items for
pets, including hand-painted, Victorian-style
bird houses that sell for as much as $1,500.
“There’s an upscaling of the pet industry
going on now, which is why we're finding a
market,” said Cannon Garber, owner of Ani-
mal Manors Inc, a Manhattan company that

manufactures elaborate homes for pets.

(Would You Buy a Bic From This Bull?

 

OT long ago, Arthur Hagger-
N ty, owner of Captain Hag-

gerty’s Dog Training School
in the Bronx, received a request
from an increasingly important
type of customer: A television
commercial production company.
It wanted a Saint Bernard that
would sit quietly and “pose” for a
commercial —— a dog that would
usually cost less than $500 a day.

But before long, the dog’s role
had increased by an order of mag-
nitude — and so had Mr. Hagger-
ty’s fee. “By the time the shoot was
over the dog had to push its way
through a kitchen door, do a dou-
ble-take at the camera, walk along
a kitchen wall and across the room,
jump up on a counter and knock
over a bunch of oranges,” Mr. Hag-
gerty said.

Mr. Haggerty, who has trained
and sold bomb-sniffing dogs and
police dogs, says that television re-
quests now account for a growing
part of his business. He charges
$450 a day for providing a pet and
handler to a production company,
and up to $1,500 if the dog has to
perform a special trick, such as
scratching at a door or at some-
one’s pants. Although dogs trained
for police work such as sniffing out

drugs bring in more revenues per
session —— at least $350 an hour,
with a two-hour minimum — they
do net provide the volume of the
acting dogs. .

Moreover, animals do not al-
ways have to be particularly well
trained to make it to TV commer-
cial stardom. Sometimes, they just
have to do what comes naturally —
be friendly and inspire love.

For example, a recent Goodyear
Tire and Rubber Company com-
mercial shows a man and his boy
driving on a rainy night in search
of their lost dog, and then the boy
spotting it. Levi Strauss & Com—
pany is running a commercial that
shows a young boy in jeans playing
with a friendly golden retriever,
and Melitta Inc., the coffee prod-
ucts manufacturer, ran a print ad
recently depicting a man drinking
coffee, dressed in a tuxedo and red
bow tie. His dog, beside him, is
watching and is wearing a red bow
tie as well. “You’ll know the differ-
ence even if you don’t choose to

share it with your best friend,” the '

copy read. ,

“With nearly 50 million pet dogs
in American households it’s obvi-
ous that people identify with canine
family members,” said Kate
Lynch, an account representative
for J. Walter Thompson who

worked on the Goodyear commer-~

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cial. “Pets contribute to increased
viewer-recall for the’product.”

But not only pets are making it
big in ads; other animals are show-
ing up as well. The Animal Theatri-
cal Agency, Owns and trains some
500 animals, including bulls that
“shave” for a Bic disposable razor,
and a lion that invests its money
with the Dreyfus Fund. The com-

pany has seen a definite increase
in -“requests for exotic animals,
such as elephants, bulls, and
lions,” said Carol McAuliff, vice
president. Animal Theatrical gets
between $125 and $1,250 for a cat or
dOg to appear in a lS-second spot;
exotic species, according to Ms.
McAuliff, command “several
times that amount.” I

CHICAGO TRIBUNE - March 12, 1987

Putting show—business animals out to pasture

By Tom Minehart

harlotte, N .C.-—Imagine a
retirement home where
residents lounge around on
small islands, eating bananas
with other former actors and .
feeling lucky they didn’t end up as
medical experiments.
Nick Carrado is developing such
a home—exclusively for retired
show-business animals. Carrado,
whose own chimpanzee, Kokomo
Jr., enjoys a cushy retirement near
Charlotte after about 25 years as
one of the most famous apes on
television, says most show-business
animals aren’t so fortunate.
-. “If the animal could talk, what
would he tell me about how show-
? business animals are treated?” said
" Carrado, 55. “He’d say, ‘We did all
these shows, look at how those
. people laughed and applauded, l
:3"; was their pal. Next thing I know,

I’m in a zoo away from my buddy.
And the next thing, I’m in a lab

. . . don’t I deserve something
better than that?’ ”

Carrado is calling the retirement
home Chimps and Friends—A
Retirement Haven for Show
Business Animals, but elephants,
dogs and any other animals that
worked in movies, television,
theater, carnivals or circuses will be
welcome.

So far, the retirement home has a
board of directors and non—profit
status from the Internal Revenue
Service. The directors are now
looking for about 200 acres of
land. Carrado said the haven would
be the first of its kind.

But Chimps and Friends would
welcome any show—business animal
on a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served basis,
providing food, shelter and
veterinary care at no cost to the

owner. A performer could even
house his animal in the haven
temporarily if he wasn’t getting any
shows, then come back and get it
when he signed a contract.

“We’re concerned about the
animal,” said Carrado. “Whatever
happens to the human being, up or
down, that’s what happens. Our
main thing is that the animal is
well taken care of in the interim or
in permanent situation.”

Some performers give their
retired show-business animals to
zoos, but often the animals can’t
adjust to zoo life, he said. The zoos
may reject them as too old, or if
they take the animals they don’t
allow their former owners to visit.
Other animals end up in “roadside
lghetto” animal shows or research
a 5.

But they can ﬁnd peace at
Chimps and Friends, which will be

 

 

closed to the public but open to
former owners who want to come
help take care of their old cohorts,~
said Carrado. There may be an

. auditorium open to the public

where a retired performer could
show his retired animal on an
occasional basis to raise funds for
the home.

The retirement haven itself will
be “primarily like a zoo, except
people aren’t going to be throwing
them peanuts and popcorn,” .
Carrado said. “They’ll just get the
kind of love they were accustomed
to. And when you have a show-
business animal, you’ve got to love
them—24 hours day.”

Most of the animals will live on
the kind of islands and moat-
surrounded grounds featured in
modern zoos, but a few may have
to be put in cages.

lion Hunting Foes ’
' Misinterpret Nature

T HAS BEEN interesting, but disturbing, to see

how an editorial in The Chronicle (February 7)
titled “Let’s Save the Mountain Lion’.’ can so clearly
misinterpret nature. . . " --

. _, As with Assemblyman Toni Bates’ Mountain‘Li—

. on Protection Bill and all the organizations in the

. Mountain Lion Coalition, TheChronicle seems to ,
think the Department of Fish and Game’s proposed can actually be very inhumane. ~

‘ plan to. resume sport hunting 0f the “.0115 (01‘ cougarsl' f To me, overprotection of animals can be a cruel '

is “a lanfor extinction.” . . ,
.. p Sln against‘the animals we love.

ALL ANIMALS are predisposed to overpopulate if '
their habitat conditions are favorable. This is 1‘
clearly what the lions have done in California with 15

years or so of no hunting, and the situation would be
much worse except a number have been taken annu- ,
ally on depredation permits. There has also been a v'

 

 

 

_. Such an attitude may stimulate donations but it
33%: certainly will not help the lions. '

These groups have fallen into the simplistic and -
emotional trap of thinking that the best way to per- -
petuate a lion population is to give it full protection
when, in actuality, “overprotection” of lions, or of

'hons

—.._...

any species, in today’s people-modified environment -

‘When lions approach the carrying capacity of
‘ - their habitat, their territorial behavior causes canni-
balism, fighting, and dispersals out of the typical lion
range, and then the wanderers interface unpleasant-
. iy with people, pets and livestock. ,

"Many of these “homeless” lions get killed on

; highways or are shot.and disposed of, but we have
., had two very serious attacks on children. The coali-
jtion and others that forced the state to stop proper
management of lions are the ones morally responsi-

ble for these tragedies. ' a '

lndia- passed a Wildlife Protection Act in 1972

' that prohibited killing animals. In a three-week wild-
, life school for about 60 wardens in charge of parks
' and preserves in India, in which I participated in

1982, I learned that during the past year the “surplus”
tigers driven from the parks and preserves had eaten

about 150 villagers.

We forget that the balance of nature requires a
death ethic, a role people must play if many of the

~ natural mortality factors are no longer active. A basic

law of nature demands that a fairly large percentage
of all the offspring must die before they reproduce,

or overpopulation, with disease, starvation, cannibal- .

steady decline in the size of the habitat available to 3

ism, and other horrible mortality factors, takes over.

The only sensible way to manage mountain lions ,
is to classify them as a game animal. When numbers ;
are low, have a closed season, but when there is an
excess, as occurs today in California, sell a limited
number of hunting licenses to provide the needed
predation to keep them in a healthy breeding densi-
ty. Money from the licenses then pays for the man-
agement and legal protection (by game wardens) of a -‘
healthy lion population. ‘ '

ANIMALS USUALLY die more humanely when
shot by a Sportsman than when they die natural-
ly. Nature actually is a battlefield with the most
bizarre forms of cruelty occuring. Wild animalsdon’t
die nicely, and each animal considers itself Number
One and may eat its parents or siblings to survive.

We must recognize nature’s need for a death "
ethic, and we should willingly be the helpful preda-
tor when needed. -

Sharon James, above, plays with

one of the dogs at her family's con-
troversial dog breeding kennel near
Buna, a tiny Jasper County town. At
left, animals wait in cramped quar-
ters to be sold.

 

UNA -— Sharon James tearfully looked
around her untidy yard, her gaze
falling at last on a c uster of poodle

puppies excitedly yelping and twisting in
their small cages.

“I tried to give them away, but I couldn’t
place them,” she said, her voice dissolving
into sobs. “The only other thing we can do is
dig a big hole and shoot them.”

James and her husband, Bobby, are cling-
ing to their dog breeding kennel as their
only hope of making a living. Both are vic-
tims of a variety of ailments and can’t work
outside their home.

But health officials have branded the ken-
nel — the object of a number of customer
complaints — a health hazard. And an edict
has been issued: Clean it up or close it down.

The James kennel — housing about 60
dogs on 25 acres near this tiny Jasper
County town — illustrates problems of un-
dercapitalized dog breeders, officials said.

“There seems to be a whole subculture
among dog breeders that get into something
like this,” said JaSper-Newton County
Health Department Director Dr. Ron Mc-
Murry. “They see dog breeding as a way to
make some money, but they don’t have
enough money to go into it the right way.

“The sad thing is that they genuinely love
their dogs. They’re not bad peeple. The
want to do something to keep themselves 0 f
welfare.”

McMurry said he was appalled by condi-
tions at the kennel when he first inspected it
a month ago.

Most of the dogs are kept in small home—
made wood and wire cages that resemble
rabbit hutches. The cages have wooden
roofs and wire bottoms. Feces were piled
several inches deep under the cages, Mc-
Murry said.

One mother dog and several pup ies were
being kept in an unused mobile ﬁome, he
said. He walked into the home, but the
stench drove him out.

The health department official gave the
family a month to clean feces under the
cages, remove the animals from the mobile
home and vaccinate the dogs for rabies.

Although the dogs spent most of their
lives in tiny pens. McMurry said, they didn‘t
seem to be abused. “It looks like they eat
better than the people do," he said.

Ironically, the value of the breeding dogs
makes the James family ineligible for food
stamps.

- - Lois Hicks, head of the Beaumont-based

Humane Society of Southeast Texas. said
her group has gotten complaints about simi-
lar kennels all around East Texas.

Commercial kennels that don’t sell dogs
beyond state borders and that are situated
in unincorporated areas don’t have to have
licenses or permits in Texas. Anti-cruelty
lavgs are very difficult to enforce, officials
sai . .

State Rep. David Patronella, D-Houston.
has introduced a bill this session that would
change all that. His bill would require all
get shops. commercial boarding kennels and

reeding kennels to have state licenses.

Several dog breeder associations are
backing the measure as a way of cleaning
upgroblems in the pet industry, Patronella
sai .

The Jameses’ wood and wire cages would

not meet the standards under Patronel-
la’s bill, said veterinarian Dr. Foy
McCasland , chief of the Texas Bureau
of Veterinary Public Health.

Wood cages are impossible to keep
sanitary, McCasland said. They absorb
urine and other moisture and offer a
safe haven for a myriad of parasites.

Control of parasites is difficult
enough under the best of circum-
stances, Hicks said.

Her group’s animal shelter in Beau-
mont was built as a textbook example
of the proper way to keep dogs and
cats. The dogs are kept in indoor chain-
link and cement dog runs in a heated
and air conditioned building. They have
constant access to fresh water, and the
cages are cleaned often.

When a puppy comes into the shelter
it is wormed and given needed shots.
and part of the $40 ad0ption fee pays
for a free visit to a local veterinarian.

Puppies often look and act well when
adOpted and when inspected by the vet,
Hicks said. At the same time they may
be infected by parasite larvae or suffer
from illnesses that don’t show up for
several days or weeks later.

When Donald Angland and his family
bought a peke-a-poo puppy from the
James kennel last year, the dog didn‘t
look very healthy to start with, he said.

Angland, a 41-year-old chemical
plant worker from Groves, said he and
his wife, Barbara, and their daughter,
Lindsey. then 7, went to the kennel at
Buna. Bobby James brought several
puppies to a portable office building
before he brought one 4-month-old fe—_
male that clung to Lindsey. In an in-
stant, the little girl fell in love with the
PUPPY- _

Angland paid $100 for the dog.

The dog his daughter named “Sis”
languished, Angland said. A local vet-
erinarian treated her for worms and
several other ills. Then, three weeks
after they got her, the dog started
dragging her hind quarters and wailing
in pain.

She died during exploratory surgery.
Angland said the veterinarian found
her tiny body full of worms.

Upset that the James couple would-
n’t refund their money, Angland filed a
lawsuit against the couple in small
claims court. When the case went to
trial in December, the kennel owners
failed to appear.

Jasper County Justice of the Peace .
Judy Richbourg entered a default judg-

ment against them.

The worst part of his experience, An-
gland said, “were the tears of our little :

girl. When a little one like that is in on
it from the time you decide to get a dog

and then decide what kind. and prepar-
ing a place for it and picking it out and
naming it and then caring for it and

them get sick and die. -

Birthday bash puts

pig in hog heaven

By SARA HENDRICKS
Post Reporter

 

v Little Priscilla the Pig turned 2
years old Friday, but she’ s not so
little anymore.

3" When the guests for her birth-
day party began arriving, all 700
pounds of her let out a happy,
hearty grunt and bolted for the
front yard where her presents
Were laid out.

But the Gypsy Rose Lee of pig-
dom stripped down to her pink
rouge and purple nail polish in sec-
onds ﬂat. She shed her 60-inch
stretch tutu and purple cape, opt-
ihg for comfort while she wolfed
down her edible presents and plen-
ty of her favorite soft drink, Moun-
tain Dew.

_;“,.__.She got a real kick out of her
new soccer ball and was honored
by a singing telegram from a look-
alike of her celebrity rival, “Miss
Piggy,” who presented her with a
bquuet of pink and white bal-
lbons. .

Little Priscilla is sister to anoth-
er famous Priscilla, who won the
hearts of many when she was
credited with saving the life of a
young boy who nearly drowned at
Lake Somerville about three years

ago.

The older sister is now out on
the farm. She’s a real porker,
weighing in at 1,100 pounds.

“I let her Opt for the country

life," said Victoria Herberta, own- :

er of the sibling pigs. ,
Priscilla became the recipient3
of several awards after her daring

rescue, went on a Texas Veteri- i:

nary Medicine state tour and was
ﬂown to Chicago for a much-publi-
cized appearance at a Chicago bel-
ly flop competition for 300-pound-
plus people.

Little Priscilla began standing

in for her sister at ceremonies ‘

when the elder developed a morn-
ing glory addiction and was sent to
the farm to detox.

The only difference in their ap-
pearance, Herberta said, is that
Little Priscilla has a mean, sassy
face. And a feisty personality to go
with it. The original Priscilla had
a sweeter temperament, she said.
. Cilly, as Herberta calls the “lit-
tle” one, was under the weather
Friday morning and a tad
grumpy. But as soon as Herberta
put her favorite doo-wop music on
the stereo and stuck a can of dog
food under her snout, she begrudg-
ingly fell for the bait.

Westin Hotel’s Ploy Fends Off Droves of Pesky Pigeons

Several huge owls have taken up
residence at the new Westin Hotel
in the District, prompting double
takes from hotel guests and work-
ers in nearby buildings.

Abidweli A. Mohamed first spot-
ted one of the owls around Christ-
mastime while working on the roof
of the Westin Center office building

“It looks real,” insisted Mo-

was real.”

Michelle Gurtner, 10, of Bethes-

thought it was real. My dad told me
it was real. But then I saw that it

didn’t move,” said Michelle, Who

was having brunch at the hotel yes-
terday with her parents and two
sisters.

The owls were installed last
spring after pigeons began landing
en masse on the hotel’s balconies
and ledges, leaving droppings 0n ' a
glass-roofed loggia in the hotel’s
inner courtyard, said Ralph S.

Goodman, director of marketing for A

the hotel. ,

Workers had to scrub the vast
stretch of glass every few weeks,
and it was estimated that the costs
of continually cleaning away the
droppings “would be incredible,” he
said.

Goodman. recalled reading that

fake owls had been successfully

used to scare away pigeons from a

“The pigeons will fly in, see the
owls and do a U-turn,” he said. “It’s

He said several officers were

Although the officers told him

Lott said he let Duke loose inside
the building. Lott said Duke found
Pond hiding inside a cardboard

Lott said Pond refused his re-

Duke the command to get Pond.

THE BOSTON GLOBE — Magazine section - February 8, 1987

LASTING LOVE - Christine Robb

LoveonannonovinNE

1974, on Cambridge
Street in East
Cambridge, Louisa
Solano found a female
beagle-pointer puppy who had
Just beenhitbyacar. Solano
called the police, and they came
and picked the dog up. Later they
called her and told her the dog
was all right — but they were -
gomg to have to put her down
because she didn’t have an
‘ owner. “She has an owner,”
Solano told them. .

The dog was christened
Pumpkin in honor of the occasion
and almost immediately ran away.
But when she came back, she
came back to stay. Twice a day,
Pumpkin and Solano took the Red
Lme to Harvard Square and

walked to the Grolier Book Shop,
which SOlano had taken over from
her mentor and the store’s
founder, Gordon Cairnie, about a
year before. Pumpkin spent a ‘
great deal of time in the store,
which specializes in poetry and is
a mecca for writers and artists.
But Pumpkin also learned to slip
out from time to time. She began
to make rounds through nearby
Harvard houses for a few student
pats and through'the finest
restaurants in the Square for a
bite of lunch, or down Plympton
Street to chase The Harvard
Crimson’s cat. “I refer to her as
the mayoress of Harvard
f Square,” Solano says. “I keep
tel ling customers she’s going to
write her memoirs someday.”
Pumpkin’s memoirs would
contain a chapter about the times
she has saved Solano’s life.
During the Blizzard of ’78, Solano
fell down in a deserted factory lot
in East Cambridge on her way
home. When she got up she had
lost all sense of direction.

 

Groping in the snow, “I found the

end of her leash,” Solano says.
“She was just sitting there. I said,

' ‘Pumpkin, home!’ And she just led

me home.”
Solano has temporal lobe

1 epilepsy, and Pumpkin has stuck

by her through many seizures,
attracting help. Once, Solano ‘
collapsed in the middle of

 

Massachusetts Avenue‘in Central i V

Square. When she regained
consciousness, the driver who
stopped to help her said he would
have driven right over her if her
dogs, Pumpkin and the late,
lamented Ben (another stray who
came to stay), hadn’t been sitting
up beside her to make a roadblock
in the face of oncoming trafﬁc.

A little more than a year ago,
Solano’s East Cambridge landlord
told her he 11 ed her apartment

g for his ‘77- A

mother. 50 Solano went condo
shopping, knowing how next-to-
impossible it is to rent cheap
apartments that allow pets. She
found a basement condo with a
separate, side entrance on
Mass. Ave. north of Harvard
Square. It was an easy walk to
work; with few stairs for her
old dogs, and, assured that
.there were no restrictions
, about pets, Solano signed a pur-
chase-and-sale agreement. That
very day, the trustees of the
condo association banned pets.
But nobody told Solano, and at

the closing, her lawyer and the
real estate broker. assured her
there were no rules about pets.
When she found out about the
new rule, she wrote the trust-
ees a letter explaining her situa-
- tion —- about her epilepsy and
her need for her animals’ help.
They never replied. She took
- them to court. She lost; She ap-
pealed, and lost again. She ap—
pealed again, and a year later
the case has not even been
docketed.
i “It amazes me that people
who smoke packs of cigarettes,
, drive cars, cannot tolerate a
dog’s excrement,” Solano says
(though she also believes that
dog owners should clean up
after their dogs). “It amazes me

 

 

 

 

 

that human beings are so totally
tolerant of their own polluting

the universe and think that
somehow by hating dogs — and

I really do think there’s a ha-

tred of dogs -— they’re going to

clean up the area.” .
Solano has had to rent an i

’ apartment, pay the mortgage

and condo fees for an empty

. condo, and pay legal fees. After

shesellsthecondo,asshehas
decided she must, she will have

i spent about $34,000 above the

selling price to keep Pumpkin
with her for the last year.

1 A banker she knows warned
her about selling the luckiess
condo — “ ‘But Louisa, you
don’t want to lose your equity.’
And I said, ‘Equity, be damned!

~_____

:Icareaboutthehumancondi-
' tion. The only reason I became

a property owner was to pro-
tect my animals,” she says. If
Solano hadn’t been able to rent
an apartment that allowed
Pumpkin, she says, “I would
have slept in the store every
night with her to keep her from

‘: going bonkers, because she was
' so used to being with someone
; -- which may seem crazy to
' some people. But I think if you

make a commitment, you’ve got
to keep it. I apply the same rule
to my friends, by the way, of
whom I consider her one.”
The bottom line is love, So-
lano says, including self-love: “I
really think dogs are a connec-

tion between us and what life

really is. Does that sound sap-

. py? I mean, if you don’t value
hfe in all its forms, you’re not

going to value yourself eventu-

' LTO, Mich. — “Senior Su-

But, Senior is the prime breed-
ing male among the .35-animal
herd, says owner Dorane Strouse,

: $35,000 and $40,000. With rank goes 3

Herd has increased about 25 per-
cent each year, with people now
_- willing to pay up to $8,000 for a
.lw’eanling female and nearly twice
arithat for one that has been bred.
“Demand stillexceeds the sup-
ply,” he said. “Since they are so
easy and inexpensive to raise, a lot
of horse people are getting into 11a-
mas now.”
The appealing animals are fast
becoming a craze among well-
heeled “hobby farmers,” Strouse .

says, in part because there are tax ‘

advantages and also because of

, the social aspect of owning such
pricey animals.

He estimates there are now
about 12,000 llamas in the United
States and Canada. Most of them
are descended from a herd import- ‘
ed in the 19205 by newspaper mag-
nate William Randolph Hearst for 2*

' San Simeon, his castle home in i

. California. ,

I “Llamas are moving West to
East like a lot of trends,” Strouse
said. There are about 60 llama
owners in Michigan. California has
at least 600 owners, according to
the International Llama Assoc1a-
tion in Bozeman, Mont.

’ A llama herd can be depreciat-
ed for tax purposes over three to
five years and an investment tax .
credit may be taken on it, but to be j
ranked as commercial a herd must:
include at least thrice breeding fe-
males, Strouse sai . _

Imports were halted in the 19305
because of concern over hoof and
mouth disease.

Aside from the appeal of their
long eyelashes, banana-shaped
ears and a vaguely camel-like
muzzle, llamas also are easy to
train and keep.

Without pasture, one bale of hay
can last an adult llama up to 10
days. and a single acre of mediocre
grazmg land can support up to five
of them, he said, putting the aver-
age annual cost per animal at
about $300.

Livestock laws in most cities
and suburbs would bar them as
backyard pets, but llamas require
so little space that rural dwellers
with as little as four acres can ac—

commodate a commercial herd,
. Strouse said.
“They are naturally potty-
. trained,” he points out. “They ’
_- pick one spot in the yard and the
- whole herd uses it. Punkin comes
. into the house and I’ve often taken
» him to local schools and he never
would go inside.”

. ' The animals’ reputation for spit-

ting is ill-deserved, Strouse said.
Females exercise this option to

discourage persistent males when
they already have been bred, and
occasionally it comes up during
territorial disputes or over feeding
order. ‘

“Females are usually the more
aggressive . . . they rarely let a
male eat first, for instance,”

Strouse said. ' '

In their native Peru, llamas are _
primarily used as as pack animals
and combed for their soft, downy

‘ wool. North American llama fans

are most interested in them as
pets, for show and as °

stock, since the wool — which sells
in the United States for about $2 an
ounce — is only popular with hand
spinners, he said.

Adult llamas stand about 48
inches at the shoulder and can
weigh up to 500 pounds, with little
obvious size difference between
the sexes. They make excellent
trail companions for hikers and
back-packers, he said, and will
haul about one-quarter of their
body weight. If overloaded, they
Simply refuse to stand up, Strouse
said.

In as few as five repetitions
Strouse says he can teach the
adults to sit on command. Learn-
ingtopullaponycartisasnapfor
these little kinfolks of the camel.
Llamas also are excellent travel-
ers, riding easily in a horse trailer

 

"7 or van, sitting down the entire way

with little need for food or water.
“One guy in Jackson jogs with
his,” he says. “it’s really some-

thing to see.”

In the West, where the animals
are most popular, they are fast re-
placing horses and mules on park
trails. That’s because they are '
much more sure—footed and re-
quire far less food than their

‘ . equine counterparts.

Their high price also can 'be at-
tributed to the fact that females

' gestate nearly a year before deliv-

ering, in most cases, a single off-
spring weighing about 30 pounds.
Conveniently, 80 percent of the
births occur between 9 a.m. and 11
a.m. and take about 15 minutes,

I Strouse said.

Llamas are extremely social an-

imals, Strouse said, and must be
- with at least one of their kind.

Goats are good, too, as extra com-

' panions for llamas.

They rarely stray, but low fenc-
ing is usually necessary to keep
away dogs, which most of them
loathe.

New hearingsought
in animal custody case

By LORI a. CUNNINGHAM
Tribune Staff Writer

DADE CITY —- It won’t help
Sambo and Trixie, but the Land O’
Lakes woman who lost custody of
her pets and a menagerie of 300
dogs, cats, rabbits, geese and
chickens now has an attorney Who
is asking for a new custody hear-
ing.

Sambo and Trixie, two of 76-
.year-old Louise Rosnagle’s favOr-
ite dogs, were euthanized. Pasco
County Judge Dan Rasmussen
Friday gave Pasco County Animal
Control custody of the animals and
authority to euthanize them upon
order of a veterinarian.

But Rosnagle’s attorney, Ro-
bert Sumner of Dade City, says in
a motion that contrary to Florida
law, she was only given three days’
notice of Friday’ s hearing on the
matter. She was entitled to at least
five days, Sumner said in the mo-
tion he said he filed Monday.

Rosnagle was not served notice

of the hearing by the Pasco County
Sheriff’s Office, until Feb. 3 at 7:30
p.m., the motion said. The hearing
was held Feb. 6 at 8:30 a.m.

Rosnagle’s constitutional rights
have been violated, Sumner said in
the motion.

She was not advised of her
right to have five days’ notice and

was confused during the hearing ‘

about how to cross-examine the
prosecutor’s witnesses or present
her own evidence by witnesses
supporting her, the motion said.

Sumner has asked that Friday’s
ruling be vacated.

A hearing on the motion was
scheduled for this morning in New
Port Richey.

Meanwhile, officials with Ani-
mal Control came to Rosnagle’s
home Tuesday, across the street
from the Animal Control shelter,
and removed the remainder of the
animals.

Two weeks ago, Animal Control

 

 

 

seized 49 dogs, two cats and five rab-
bits from her Lake Patience Road

property

Not all the animals were taken
on Jan. 27 when the other dogs were
seized because they couldn't be
housed immediately, officials testi-

, fled Friday.

Animal Control officials said

I Friday the animals were impounded
because they were in need of medi-
cal attention, food and water and

many were cramped in filthy cages.
At about noon Tuesday, Rosna-

" gle’ s daughter, Ellen Hoover, at? 3

her mother was working as a ciean
ing lady. But Hoover was there?
watching as Animal Control officers

; tried to trap the remaining animals.

"They're having fun chasing
some chickens," said Hoover, who

. lives with her mother.

A total of 18 dogs, including
Sambo, were euthanized because of
medical problems or behavioral
problems, officials said. Trixie was
euthanized the day after the Jan. 27
seizure because of acute medical
problems, said Denise Hilton, Ani-
mal Control field supervisor. The
dog had a tumor hanging from her

stomach, Hilton said.

' Tribune Staff Writer

.‘ ST. 'PETERSBURG — Jerry,
“The Nutritionally Sound Rat,” put a
kink in 12-year-old Ezra Wise’s sci- ,
ence project last month. The rat he’d
fed healthy food rolled over and
,died in his cage.

Wonder of wonders, Tom, "The
Junk Food Rat,” is still thriving on
his diet of pizza, pretzels, brownies,
cupcakes and ice cream. . I.

The junior scientist still hasn’t :’
figured out why it happened. But he '-
decided to enter his project, called
“Nutrition —- Is It Really Good For
You?”,‘ in the 1987 Pinellas County
Regional Science and Engineering
'Fair. - ,

. The fair is on display today and
Sunday at the Science Center of Pi-
nellas County, 7701 22nd Ave. N.
More than 200 exhibits by middle
and high school students will be—dis-
played. -

Wise, a seventh-grader at John F.
Kennedy Middle School in Clearwa-
ter, spent about five months working
on his project.

He bought two “identical” rats,
put them in cages in his bedroom

and fed them radically different
diets. .

' He watched and waited. _

, He expected that Jerry, who be
fed a diet of seeds, grain, rice, rat
pellets and other healthful foods,
.Vmuld beCome “sleek and active,”
while Tom, on a junk-food diet,
would become fat and sluggish.

’ The rats surprised him.

One morning last month, Wise re- .

turned from Spending the night at
his grandmother’s house to find Tom
I perky as ever. Jerry, who had never
been perky anyway, was dead. -. :

“I’d have to say it was natural
causes, even though that sounds kind

. of weird,” Wise said. , . g
Wise, whose favorite food is
“that processed chicken you get at
f Burger King,” reached this conclu-
sion: “I think healthy food is better
for you, but I’m still going to eat a lot
of junk food.”

Other science projects produced
surprising results.

Alexandra Dvoredsky, 12, an
eighth-grader at Seminole Middle
School, hooked 13 teachers up to a
blood pressure machine and played

irec‘orded sounds to them — includ-
~fing~silence, a football game and hard
if rock music — to see how the noises
‘saf-fected their blood pressures.
rDvoredsky’s experiment showed
, that “teachers cannot stand the si-
lence — their blood pressure‘actu-
any rises when no sound is made
- and lowers with sound."
Some of the projects looked
. more like the work of Ralph Nader
than Albert Einstein.
.. Meredith Dunn, a 16-year-old St.
“Petersburg High School junior,
fgvrapped panty hose around a 45-
.. rpm record and played it on her
stereo to test the strength of the

eighth-grader at Shorecrest Prepara-

tory School in St Petersburg, bor-
rowed his track coach’s old sneakers
and cut them in half to show how the

runner’s feet and legs.

This year’s fair includes more
exhibits than ever, about 220, said
Susan Gordon, director of the Sci-
ence Center. .

“We started with nine exhibits in
> 1981,” Gordon said. j‘We’ve come a
long way.”

About 10 high schools and 20
, middle schools are participating,
; Gordon said. ' _

Each participating school usually
has its own fair earlier in the school
year and sends its top four or five
exhibits to the county fair, Gordon
said. The top 12 county exhibits will
be sent to the 32nd Annual Florida

Science and Engineering Fair, to be -

held Aprilg8-10 in Bradenton.

mericans have a1- ,

ways coddled their
canine friends, but
g lately things seem to
be getting out of hand. Take,
for example, the case of [(-9
.Kola.

- The drink, which contains no caf-_

“feine, ’carbonation or cola beans, was

’ introduced in 1981. Reportedly, it last
ed like weak grape juice.

It promptly fizzled. In a well-publi-

eized “Pupsi Challenge” in Texas, some ,

' 'of the dags shunned the Kola. “Thirty-
1'five percent of them would drink it,
but that wasn’t high enough,” says Ed-

ward Reed of R&Y Enterprises in,

.. Reed. “I thought she was out of her
mind.”

, Maybe not. This summer, REY En-

terprises will re-introduce K-9 Kola.
Among the new flavors: Garlic Ade.
_Asserts Reed: “It’s highly acceptable.”

Bruce Fogle, a London veterinari-
an, took in actor John Gielgud’ 5 dogs

for a couple of weeks while the actor

was in America. Each Wednesday,a
van delivered gourmet foods for the
animals: fresh duck-liver paté, fresh
. prawns and Swedish butter biscuits.

“It was a terrible diet for dogs,”
Fogle writes in Games Pets Play (Vi-
king. $15. 95). “My family ate royally for
a month.”

That sums up Fogle’s reluctance to
get involved in the anthropomorphiz-
ing many pet owners engage in. Just
because your pup is your best friend
doesn’t mean it should eat the same
food you do; even though it follOWS you

Actually, Fogle argues, dogs are

1 ,

only loyal in the sense that they are
faithful to their pack, and the owner is
part of the pack.

This vet, it should be noted, owns a

golden retriever named Liberty Olymé ‘
pia Sweetpea Chewingdog Fogle.

“Peeple are treating dogs like chil-
dren, ” says Robin Gough, a trainer at

packs that open up and fold out into a ~

“It’s a status-type thing,” explains
Gough. “As you move up, your dog
moves up with you”.

“At Halloween, we get calls for the
bridal dresses,” adds Betty Forsht of

Judi’ 5 Pet Care (“The Usual and Unusu-

al Pet Shop”) in Woodbridge, Va. “We

measure the dog, and the dress is cut to

order. People put them in parades.”

just as cold as we do. It’s a question of
keeping the animals comfortable. A

Says Gough: “Seventy five percent

Researchers at the University “a?"

Pennsylvania have summarized the
seven key reasons people keep pets. .,
They provide something to care for, to ’
é keep busy with, to touch and to watch,

1 and they make us feel safe, provide a'

stimulus to exercise and guarantee
companionship.

With all those potential benefits,
it’s surprising that people ever bother

. to get married or have children. In the
. eyes of many owners, in fact, a pet is

the emotional equivalent of a 4-year-
old child. Fido, however, is never going

who f ractm'ed bird’s wing

By LESLEY COLLINS
Tribune Staff Writer

DUNEDIN — A great blue heron
never will ﬂy again after an irate
fisherman hurled a chunk of con-
crete at it, fracturing the bird’s right
wing, a Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary
official said Thursday.

‘ Dunedin police are searching for
the man, about 24 years old, who
threw the concrete at the heron
about 5:15 pm. Sunday while fishing
on a small bridge leading to Dunedin
Causeway Beach.

David Jackaway, 32, of Clearwa-
ter, told police the majestic seabird
had been trying to snatch a fish from
the man’s cast net when the con-
crete sailed through the air.

“This guy was like a pitcher with
a hardball,” he recalled. “It was a
pretty sick situation.”

Before taking offense at the
heron, J ackaway said, the fisherman
took delight in tossing small baitfish
into the middle of the road, hoping
that passing motorists would kill
some half dozen pelicans trying to
scoop them up in their bills.

“The other fishermen thought
that was all kind of funny,” Jack-
away said.

But when the great blue heron
was left stunned, its right wing dan-
gling on its side, he’d had enough.

. “I told the man to stay put while
my girlfriend called. the police,”
Jackaway said.

But the fisherman hopped in his
van, assuring them he would come
back later.

The man never returned, Jack-
away said. As of Thursday, police
had not tracked him down.

“There’s no reason why that bird
should be crippled,” said Diana
‘ King, rehabilitative supervisor at the
Suncoast Seabird Sanctuary, 18328
Gulf Blvd., Indian Shores. “It’s an
unfortunate way to get one this way
._ very depressing.” ..

The adult heron, which stands
about 41/2 feet high, will be exam-
ined today to determine whether the
battered wing must be amputated.

“It will never ﬂy again,” King
said. “But we’re trying to salvage the
wing for balance.”

The heron, named for its bluish-

said Greg Holder, a biologist with

Persons convicted of injuring the
birds — a second-degree misde-
meanor — can be fined up to $500
and sentenced to 60 days in jail.

Hodel s threatening offshore plan

ONDEMNATION OF INTERIOR Secre-

tary Donald Hodel’ 5 plan to drill oil off
the CalifOrnia shOre is sweeping along the
:c0ast like a huge slick. Hodel, last week,
gushed forth a proposal that would Open 13
Spercent of previously closed federal waters
§off California to oil and gas exploration. Put a
:cap on it, Mr. Secretary.

: Nothing seems to deter the Interior Dep-
;artment. California congressional represen-
itatives of both parties are united in opposi-
ition. Republican Sen. Pete Wilson is sharply
icritical Local residents are ready to erect
legal barriers preventing construction of on-
fshore facilities necessary to support construc-
tion and operation of new platforms Gov.
Qeukmejian, however, has been far less criti-
eai of Hodel’s prOposals. Indeed, the Interior
secretary says that his plan has taken the
governor’s suggestions into account. Further
explanation is needed from Sacramento. ‘

f‘r-I‘J'l‘he proposal would open waters north of
San Luis Obispo to platforms for the first
time, and allow drilling within three miles
fmm shore in such areas as the Eel River
basin off Eureka, most of Mendocino County,
and San Mateo County from Pescadero to
Ano Nuevo. Hodel’s plan ignores a compro—
mise offered by state representatives that
would have allowed offshore buffer zones of
up to 18 miles in some areas, so oil 'derricks
would not be visible from shore.

Opposition was obviously expected. Hodel
isgoing over the heads of state representa-

tives rather than seeking a compromise. He-

.minimized the environmental sensitivity of
the coastline, and its economic and scenic
value to residents and visitors. Indeed, he has
'ﬁ'aid little attention to the decline in crude

rices and production that caused oil compa-
tries to slash their exploratory budgets and

1.0;".

cap marginal offshore wells. The oil compa-
nies have simply stopped doing high-risk dril-
ling, and that’s what these proposed tracts are
all about.

Hodel’s decision is based not so much on
economic or environmental issues, but on
politics. It’s in that arena the secretary be-
lieves he has an edge. The California plan will
not be considered separately, bUt as part of a
nationwide five-year proposal for leasing on
the outer continental shelf. Overturning the
proposal will require legislation passed by
both houses of Congress and signed by the
president, which is not likely.-

California’s critics will argue that the state
does not have the right to demand special
treatment. In the past, California’s congres-
sional delegation used its clout to impose
sweeping moratoriums on coastal drilling in
scenic areas, but House'support for the state’s
position has declined. It will not be enhanced
by such tactics as that proposed by Democrat-
ic Rep. Barbara Boxer, who introduced legis-
lation to ban permanently any drilling within
200 miles of the coast.

If California wants the nation to take its
coastline into account, then we have to take
the nation’s needs to heart; America needs oil
reserves. Some of that supply will have to
come from the Pacific. A compromise consid-
ering the needs of the federal government,
the oil industry, fishermen, the tourist indus-

try and the environment must be fashioned;

otherwise the battle will go on. As no new
drilling is scheduled before 1989, andthe
Northcoast tracts now being considered
could not go into production before the year

2000, offshore use is sure to be a political

theme of the future. Competent leadership,
not flashy oratory, is needed.

Chickens rUffle some feathers

By Rick Cziment
Staff writer

f‘ It doesn’t matter whether the Pettite family’s five
chickens cluck or crow. The birds have been ordered

to fly the coop.

. . Culver City Council members, perhaps feeling more
iike farm hands than city officials, voted 3-2 to honor
the request of a henpecked neighbor and force the
Pettites to get rid of the pets from their Albright
Avenue home. Council. members Richard Alexander
.and Jozelle Smith dissented.

f A second family on the block faces the same fate.
:The Gamboas, who also keep chickens, must come
before a council hearing Sept. 22.

j; The prospects for chicken lovers don’t look good.

;-_ “This area is zoned residential, not agricultural,”
, said Councilman Richard Brundo. “And a residential
neighborhood is just that. It’s not a farm.”

; The city requires residents to obtain permits to

keep such animals, but the Opposition of a single
neighbor can be grounds for denial.

Granting the permit would be fine “if all the
neighbors agreed,” said Councilman Paul Jacobs. “But
if one homeowner insists that the city maintain a
residential neighborhood, that is good enough for me.”

4 The decision came after a public hearing during
which the angry resident, Karen Avines, traded ac-
cusations with her neighbors.

Avines said she was bothered by crowing roosters
at sunrise and that rats were attracted to the chicken

feed. She said she had trapped some of the rodents

and had photographed several.
“It’s just filthy. I don’t want rats. That’s all I want

to say,” Avines told the council.

Enter the pro-chicken forces. .

Petitions bearing the names of 50 neighbors who
support the Pettites and Gamboas were presented
to the council. Mike Gamboa said he kept the chickens
as “educational aids” to teach theirchildren respon-
sibility and for eggs. .

Other pets apparently would not suffice. “You all

' know what dogs can do to lawns,” Gamboa said.

As part of the battle, the Gamboas even had an
investigator for the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals — his name was John Henn —
inspect the premises. He declared them clean and
certified that they were hens, not roosters.

Hens occasionally are stuck with an undeserved
bad reputation. Roosters are known to be much louder.

Said Gamboa’s wife: “Only roosters crow. Our
(chickens) do make a sound, and it’s called clucking.
They do it before they lay eggs.”

And there were countercharges. '
The Pettites and Gamboas claimed that Avin
for years had kept several loudly barking dogs, and
that their large bags of food were responsible for

the rodent pepulation.

But the council cried fowl and ended the dispute.
For the two families, parting withthe chickens won’t
be easy, especially for the children.

“I don’t think it’s hit my little one,” mother Kaye
Pettite said after the hearing.

Animal ‘harVeSting’ can be butchery

I have to disagree with Larry
Hilaire’ 5 Feb. 1 letter regarding
‘ the beaver population along the
South Platte Greenway. He
equates the trapping that was out-
lawed by the city of Denver with
“controlled harvesting of an over-
po ulation of animals.” ‘-
arvesting is still just a euphe-
mism for the greedy butchery that
often takes place. Many forms of
; wildlife have been brought nearly
or fully- to extinction by “harvest-

ing.”

I take issue with the contention
that animal-rights activists have
only an emotional basis for their
activities. Only a fool could deny
the obvious fact that our own sur-
vival is linked with that of the rest
of the ecosystem of which we are
a part, in ways we are only begin-
ning to appreciate.

There is obviously a value to all
life forms independent of the dol-
lar value we place on their hides.
There are plenty of rational argu-
ments for protecting animal

rights, though a healthy human be-
ing integrates both reason and
emotion. .
Finally, decisions about wildlife
should not be the exclusive territo-

' ry of the Division of Wildlife; they

need input from all of us who care
about such an important part of
our national and local heritage.

TAMPA TRIBUNE

 

 

February 15, 1987‘

THE VOTERS WILL DECIDE

Animal Rights ...

in a March 3 referendum, Hillsborough County
voters will be asked this question: “Shall lost, aban-
doned or unwanted animals which have not been
claimed or adopted and which will otherwise be hu-
manely euthanized be provided for biomedical and
scientific research, study or teaching at a federally
registered animal research facility in Hillsborough
County prior to such euthanasia?” The following two
columns debate both sides of this issue. _ .

' ., . By RAINI SEQUOYA

There is a powerful story to be told about the spirit-
ual kinship between all beings.

Humans have historically viewed other animals as
essentially dissimilar from themselves and thus outside
their purview of concern or moral responsibility. It we
are to fundamentally alter this myopic perception, our

,_ goal must be to work toward enlarging the vision of the

community to include all the earth’s inhabitants.

The harsh reality is that human history has been a
chronicle of carnage. If these past decades of frustration
in the animal rights movement have proven anything
conclusively, it is that exploitation of animals is not

merely the product of ignorance but a reflection of pro-

found anthropocentric arrogance. a feeling that man

‘ alone is the center of the universe.

 

, Rain'i Sequoya is president and founder of National ,
g Animal Rights, Inc. of Tampa, ,;

Those who brutaiize and maim animals in the name

of science are themselves victims of a world gone mad
that is rapidly devastating the precious life of this
planet’s animal kingdom.

L For this precise reason, using lost, strayed, unwanted
and stolen pets for animal experimentation at the Uni-
versity of South Florida College of Medicine is not only
inhumane but counter-productive. It retards competent

' research.
Responsible educators and researchers who truly

want to benefit both human animals and non-human ani-
mals will turn away from the archaic practice of using
animals as research tools. It has been proven that. due
to an animal’s ability to elicit responses of pleasure and
pain and to the function of their brain and nerve struc-
tures, they are in fact sentient beings, capable, as we
are, of feeling pain and suffering.

Animal experimenters continue to claim they “hu-
manely use" animals in research, yet they demand ex-
emption from animal anti-cruelty laws.

Not only ‘does the inability to document the age,

breed, medical history or enVironmental background of
these animals supplied by Hillsborough County Animal

Control to USF make the research‘poor quality, but ‘it
also leads to serious misinterpretation of results. Each-
of these variables is very important to research in gen-

eral. Any paper on a research protocol on human sub-

jects that did not account for each or these variables

‘ predict and thus prevent Sudden in-

conduct unannounced inspections of
all research facilities regularly. As
’an additional guarantee, USF’s Col-
lege of Medicine is a member of the
highly respected American Associa-
tion for the Accreditation of Labora-
tory Animal Care (AAALAC). For
membership, an institution .must
maintain and enforce rigorous
standards for humane care and
treatment of research animals. AAA-
LAC conducts regular facility in-
spections also. '
7 The availability of pound ani-
mals for teaching is crucial. Medical
' ;Students learn most effectively by
hands-on experience with living sys-
tems. Early in their medical educa-
- tion they are taught how a healthy
normal system functions. The reac-
tions of organs to various stimuli are

both interdependent and complex.“

Reading a text book isn’t enough;

Tone must see for oneself. Later,
using pound animals, students learn
medical procedures and how to ban-
dle live tissue. While they learn,
they are responsible for treating
.laboratory animals with the utmost
humane care, always using anesthe-
sia. , ~

All physicians and other health
professionals must be taught new
‘ procedures for diagnosis and treat-
ment through continuing medical
education.

Each 11 w technological ad-
Vance, eachsnew piece of equipment
,must be tested and methods learned
before application on patients. New
techniques such as laser surgery
’ may revolutionize therapy, but they
are potentially dangerous. Without
using animals, patient care becomes
experimental.

Pound animals are critical to
3 some very important research in
progress at USF. Here are some ex-
amples:

- The study of environmental
causes of bronchial spasm such as
.pollen and red tide toxin. The find-
‘ ings will apply to chronic lung dis-
ease and to asthma. ,

. - Investigation of coronary

blood flow. The holder of USF’s first
endowed chair seeks ways to treat
~ and prevent heart attacks and coro-
nary artery disease.

- Kidney failure in septic shock.
Affecting all areas of medicine and
all people, septic shock invariably
causes kidney failure and frequently
leads to death.

0 Blood flow in small vessels.
The results of these investigations
have significant applications to the
treatment of shock, hypertension
and stroke.

0 Brain center control of breath-
ing. A clear understanding of this
function may enable researchers to

fant death and aid stroke victims.

0 Lung diseases in children. The -
study of the production of lung

' mucus could result in better treat-

ment for cystic fibrosis, a common '
and ultimately fatal childhood afﬂic-
tion. . .

- Implantation of new plastic ar-
terial grafts. The long-term durabil-
ity of this new plastic artery will
help those who suffer blockage of
major arteries primarily the elderly.

Virtually every major biomedi-
cal advance can be attributed to
studies using animals. A major rea-
son the average human life span has
increased from 45 years in 1900 to
70-plus years today can be attributed
to lessons learned in animal studies.
The resemblance between cats and
dogs and man isclose enough that
research findings in one are usually
applicable to the other.

Among the hundreds of medical
advances coming from dog research
are blood tranfusions, measurement
of blood pressure, anesthesia and
thus surgery on a living being, heart
by-pass equipment and procedures,
insulin for control of diabetes, organ
transplants, bone setting and joint
replacement.

Cats have served investigations
of epilepsy, deafness, breast cancer,
leukemia, neurological disorders,
eye and skin diseases. ' ,

If USF loses access to local
pound animals, one of the projects
described above will be delayed
until additional funding can be

.jound. The rest of this research will

simply stop. If it could replace the
local pound animals, the college
would pay 50 times what it now .
spends or approximately $250,000 of
your tax money each year to pur-
chase from out-of-state dealers an-
other state’s pound animals.

If replacement‘animals are bred
for research, the cost in dollars will
be in the millions. The cost in ani-
mal lives will increase, too. Pound
animals will still be killed, new ani-
mals will be bred to be used in re-
search and then destroyed.

All recent national polls show
that an overwhelming majority of
people in this country support ani-
mal research. Mallory Code’s and
Lilah Koch’s parents are voting Yes
for pound animals in research and
teaching. 80 are other Hillsborough
County citizens who know they owe
their improved health, and some
their lives, to animal research.

If you are still uncertain how you
Will vote, why don’t you seek the ad-
vice of someone you truly trust? Ask
your own doctor, your pet’s veteri-
narian or your pharmacist. They
will vote Yes and so should you.

ance into any medical journal.

The psychological trauma the
animals experience in unfamiliar
surroundings, being handled by
strangers, has a definite, medically
. proven, adverse effect on their
physiological and biological bodily
functions, further invalidating any
competent research results.

The use of pound-seized animals
for research is simply a subsidy of
animal research by pounds or by
those regulating animal control
agencies. As such it is an inappropri-

ate means of encouraging marginal!

research. Adequately educated re-
searchers shun the use of confis-
cated animals because of the prob
lems noted above.

For decades, medical students
have been given animals for prac-
. tice surgery, physiology, pharma-
cology or for other labs. If one is in‘
the jurisdiction that provides pound-
seized animals for research 01‘
education for a very inexpensive

price, then one is not encouraged to'

think of more precise and creative
ways of teaching ' .
Many medical schools no longer
use animals for practice surgery.
Models and operating room “ap-
prenticeship” are far better educa-
' tional tools. Models are available
from the N asco Company in Fort At-
kinson, Wi., for virtually every con-
ceivable purpose a medical student
would want an instructional aid. I
personally have offered to fund the
USF medical school with modern al-
ternatives that are available today
providing they cease confiscating
our lost, abandoned and stolen pets
from Hillsborough County.
Sixty-six out of 67 Florida coun-
ties have abolished this archaic
practice. It is bafﬂing to the public
why USF medical school insists on
perpetuating inferior research by
using bargain basement instruments
(animals) at $3 to $5 a head.
A- It is not the potential loss of ac-
cess to pound-seized animals that
makes researchers nervous when
debating this issue. They are actu-
ally concerned about restriction or
regulation of their grant money. Ani-
mal experimenters tend to resist out-
side ideas and outside regulation;
they tend to see their research re-

sources as belonging under their
awn gushes: haw “er!

M... .. -..~ se‘.

Humane euthanasia in a sheiier
in no way resembles the fate of an
animal in a research laboratory. An
intravenous injection of sodium pen- .
tobarbital, carefully administered -:
by competent shelter personnel, is
an unfortunate but in no way trau-
matic death for an animal. To say
that the necessity for euthanizing ' ‘,
animals in shelters is a justification '
for sending these animals to a labo-
ratory misses several important
points. Animals shipped to laborato-
ries are caged, trucked across town
and loaded into a new facility where ,
their own needs are forgotten in the
business of science. ' ' ’

The definition of animal shelter
is a place of protection, a refuge or a
haven for lost, strayed and aban-z
doned pets. It is not to serve as a
warehouse for avid animal experi-
menters to perpetuate their crimes
against these unconsenting-creatures
and also against humanity.

It is one thing for the scientific
community to fail to organize a sys-
tematic effort against the desecra-
tion of life and nature. It is another
matter that we, the taxpayers, are
Sanctioning it all by paying the bill.

Until the practice of pound sei-
zure is stOpped completely, progres-
sive efforts towards solving the trag-
edy of' pet overpopulation in Hills-
borough County cannot be realisti-
cally addressed.

The animal experimenters are
unconcerned with this tag...“ till?
lizing these helpless animals as re-
sources in the name of personal
greed. Shamefully, Hillsborough
County is the final bastion in the
state of Florida still suffering from
this social plague of pound seizure.

As the forces grow, justice for
the animals will prevail and set in
perspective the irrational verbiage ~.
set forth by the animal experiment- '
ers.

Humaneness and compassion to-
wards all of God’s sentient creatures"
are the hallmarks of an enlightened

. community and the badge of a cul-

tured individual-

16 dog sledders mush without slush in Montana race

By Jim Robbins
Special to The Denver Post _
HELENA, Mont. - Amid bal-
my temperatures and no snow, 16
mushers slid to a start on straw
and dry pavement in front of the
state Capitol on Sunday for a gru-
eling fiveday, 500-mi1e dog sled
mceo c. ., ',r'l
The race, which offers a $5,000

first-place rize, is the longest in.

the lower 8 states.

Because of the lack of snow,
the startin town was only a cere-
monial one.

The dogs and mushers ulti-

mately were trucked several mi-
les south of the city to a point high
enough for snow. Race officials
said that, except for the portion in
town, the rest of the trails had
plenty of snow. . ,

Even so, mushers were con-
cerned that the unseasonal tem-
peratures — they were in the 50s
— might slow the dogs, which are
mostly Siberian and Alaskan hus-
kies, animals that function best at
subzero temperatures.

Weather aside, the route of the
Governor’s Cup also poses prob-

lems. It is rugged, with verysteep

and long uphill and downhill runs.

In contrast, the 1,720-mile Alas-
kan Iditarod — the country’s
most famous and longestdog sled
race — is mostly flat

Mushers started the race Sun-
day three minutes apart, and will
have a series of 10 checkpoints
along the route, with one manda-
tory one-hour layover.

Most mushers will drive the
sleds for four or five hours, feed
the dogs, then rest for two hours.
It is a schedule they will maintain
around the clock.

worry,” said John Patten, 43, a
burly, bearded musher from
Grand Maris, Minn. “The tough-
est thing to do is get water in
them, because under stress dogs
don’t want to drink.” ,

Patten’s secret is to mix tripe
or ground liver with the water.

Patten said he feeds his huskies
— which have names like Rocket
Man, Zero, Walter Payton and
Mary Decker — roughly every 50
miles, and occasionally offers a
meatball in between.

At each checkpoint, the dogs’
feet are examined for sores. If

there is a problem, the dogs are
given cloth booties.

‘flt’s important to take care of
yourself, too,” Patten said.
“You're fatigued. You can hallu-
cinate. Almost every kind of emo-
tion goes through your min .”

Why, then, do mushers partici-
pate in what seems to be such a
tortuous Sport? The reasons vary.

“Basically, for the money,”
said George Michamd, 39, of Cow-
dery in northwestern Colorado.

Said Patten: “It’s exciting and
it’s a challenge. The money right
now is secondary.”

A BRITISH LORD
WANTS TO GO
TO THE DOGS . . .
LITERALLY!

Some say he’s barking up the wrong
tree, others say he’s howling mad, but
Lord Avebury is doggedly deter-
mined to have himself turned into ca-
nine fodder. A 58-year-old Liberal
peer, Buddhist convert, ecology enthu-
siast and pet aficionado, Avebury
wants to bequeath his body to The
Dogs Home, Battersea—London’s
best—known refuge for strays—where
he hopes his remains will be turned
into chow. “It’s a nice gesture to give
the doggies a good meal, and it will
save Battersea the cost of some
food,” said Avebury, whose 168-pound
frame would yield the equivalent of
$112 in canned victuals. “We have to
do something with our bodies, and this
is ecologically sound. It’s a terrible
waste that bodies are buried or cre-
mated when they should be recycled.”

His proposal has provoked grave re-
action. “l’m horrified,” said Bill Wad-
man-Taylor, Battersea’s manager. “I’m
sure there’sa lot of nourishment in a
human carcass, but I wouldn’t ask my
staff to cut it up and feed it to the
dogs.” A spokesman for Pedigree
Churn, one of Britain’s top brands of
dog food, said of Avebury, “He’s obvi-
ously quite serious and trying to make
a point, but I don’t know what the point
is. Human remains are not a natural
food for dogs, and we doubt they
would eat it.” Lord Avebury—who as
plain Eric Lubbock was once a leading
figure in the Liberal Party—is ev 'n
getting chewed out by those close to
him. His wife isn’t keen on the idea, and
his solicitor is trying to dissuade him
from his psychodogmatic effort.

All the criticism has left Avebury
with his tail between his legs. He's now
considering alternative uses for his
body, such as feeding fishes or fertiliz-
ing trees. Yet his original wish remains
unchanged. “i love dogs," he said. “I
can think of nothing better than having
my bones gnawed once I’m gone." E]

Visiting the Battersoa dogs home, Lord
Avebury gave two pups a forotasto of
what he hopes will be an appatlzlng mod.

Dogs ahead in race forwomen’s affection

'...The early, returns are in, and
the dogs are winning. .»

Last Sunday I asked readers to
reispond to one of the burning so-
cial issues of our time: Which
makes a better companion for to-
day’s single woman -— an ’803
man or a dog?

:You might recall that the Man
vs. Dog Poll was prompted by my
overhearing a Memphis woman
say she was about ready to give
up on men and get a dog.

Here are a few of the first re-
sponses:

"Dogs make better compan-
ions because they don’t make
faces when family members ap-
pear unannounced and they are
comfortable when strange men
smile at you.” ——Vicky Benson

“The majority of men I’ve en-
countered since moving to Mem-
phis seem to be Neanderthals
who thinkescargots are French
automobiles, sushi is a variation
of a pig call, and the most stimu-
lating evening conceivable is
watching Memphis State basket-
ball on television while guzzling
beer from a can.” —-Diane Mur-
ray

“Both need a leash.” —Clara
Joralemon

“I’m not sure I know what an
’803 man is, but I suspect the dog
wouldn’t want to be unfair by be-
ing in the same competition. I

 

guess I’d have to go for the dog. .

Now a ’503 guy, that’s something
else!” —Terry Carr

sense of humor, which they’ve
acquired wading through all the
liberated women while looking

for us un-’8OS women who still .

believe that a good man de-

serves to be taken care of.” ~—

Connie Marino

“When a woman says having a
dog would be better than a man,
does she really mean she would
prefer a man who doesn’t talk
back unless spoken to and can be
trained to do tricks?” —,--Joel 0.
Blackford

“How often does today’s fe-
male wish she could make her
date sit up and beg? Voila.” —
Jon Vanderhook

“I vote for a dog as a compan-
ion, and I feel good about this de~
cision. I own a sheltie.” -—Max-
ine Lebovitz .

“Men kiss better, when they
want to. But dogs don’t criticize

your hair style or your dress or *

TAMPA TRIBUNE - February 15, 1987

Natural pet foods popular

As people becorne more aware of
- what they eat, they tend to watch
,their pets’ nutrition as well, says

one official. ’

'By ERIC SCHMITT
New York Times News Service

~* ~ NEW YORK — A growing number of ardent pet own-
ers are scrapping traditional pet food, including home-
'style potluck, and feeding their dogs and cats so-called
natural brands. Companies such as Cornucopia and Hills
‘Pet Products, which scorn such labels, preferring simply
to call their products high-quality, often sell their wares
only through veterinarians. '

One of the most aggressive of the new natural pet.

food companies is Lick Your Chops Inc., which has de-
veloped a loyal following willing to pay more for what
Some pet owners say is a more healthful food. The com-
pany, founded by veterinarian brothers and situated in
iWestport, Conn., stresses a holistic, disease-prevention
approach to animal care. '

,. The veterinarians, Robert and Martin Goldstein,
.with Robert’s wife, Susan, began the company in 1979.
Today Lick Your Chops has five stores in the Northeast,
including one in New York City, which opened last
November. Lick Your Chops has also been a strong
seller in the specialty foods department at Blooming-
, ~dale’s in Manhattan, and thecompany plans toopen a
franchise in Coral Springs, Fla., within three months.

1 . “We’re a one-stop shopping center for the animal,
with an optimum approach to nutrition,” said Goldstein,
who opened the company’s first shop next door to her
husband’s veterinary practice in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.
' The growth of Lick Your Chops coincides with the
rapid diversification of the pet food industry, now esti-
mated to be worth $5.4 billion a year. Especially strong
are expensive premium foods using higher-quality in-
gredients.

The Ralston Purina Co., for example, last summer in-
h‘bduced Purina Pro Plan, a line of 19 cat and dog foods
containing more protein and choicer ingredients. The
products are sold through veterinarians, specialty pet
food stores and certain Purina retail outlets.

Pet owners have fed homemade concoctions to their ‘

cats and dogs for years. But Lick Your Chops says its pet
_ program goes beyond mere dog chow. The stores fea-
ture grocery and frozen food sections, an apothecary
and a bakery offering freshly baked liver and seafood
biscuits for dogs and catnip crackers for cats.

There is even a gift section selling monogrammed
"b'andanas for cats and dogs, among other fashion-ori-
ented items. The pet foods, formulated by the Goldstein
brothers, use choice meats and whole grains but eschew
preservatives, chemicals or dyes. “People are more con-
scious about eating healthy and that their pets eat
healthy, too,” said William S. Lane, group buyer of
.Bloomingdale’ s food division. “They’re projecting them-
selves onto their animals.”

" Some veterinarians and pet food industry analysts

scoff, at the notion that natural pet foods, including Lick
Your Chops, are more healthful than the mass-market
brands. Furthermore, according to them, this natural-
food trend represents little more than bands of owners
doting on their pooches.

“The only application for that market is in pseudoso-
phisticated towns and cities that typically go with any
tad,” observed George V. Noveilo, an analyst at E.F.
Hutton. “This is for the certain percentage of pet owners

‘ who treat their pets like humans.”

Jason Judd is among that percentage: For him, ordi-
nary kibble won’t do. '

“Why risk your family?” asked Judd, who recently
stopped by the Lick Your Chops Manhattan store with
his 8-month-old bearded collie to buy eight pounds of
puppy chow. “You don’t skimp on your own food.”

. Yet some experts doubt whether pet owners are get-
ting a good value for their dollar.

“I’m skeptical of almost all the holistic approaches,”
said Dr. Michael S. Garvey, chairman of the medical de-
partment at the Animal Medical Center in New York.
“They are supported by purely testimonial types of
documentation instead of good scientific studies.”

Lick Your Chops says that its products have been ap-
proved for sale by state regulatory agencies and the
Food and Drug Administration. '

The company’s brands are about twice as expensive
as those of larger commercial competitors. A 14.5-ounce
can of moist dog food, for example, which lists such in-
gredients as brown rice and filtered well water, costs
$1.10. According to Ms. Goldstein, the choice of ingredi-
ents may add more calories but it also helps fill up an
animal on about one-third less food. In the long run, a
Lick Your Chops dietcosts only about 25 percent more,
she said.

“I love my animals so I think it’s worth it,” said An-
drea Liegeois of Yorktown Heights, N. Y., who has
served her seven cats and two dogs Lick Your Chops for .
about five years. _

The bulk of customers buying Lick Your Chaps for
their pets are women between 30 and 45 years old and
retired peOple, said Ms. Goldstein, whose company has
grown steadily in the past two years. It opened corporate
headquarters in Westport in 1984, later adding fran-
chises in Branford, Conn., and Richboro, Pa. Sales ap-
proached $800,000 last year, up from $450,000 in 1985.

The company’s big break, however, came when
Bloomingdale’s agreed to give its brands a three-week
tryout last October.

‘ “It surpassed our sales projections by at least 50 per-
cent,” said Lane of Bloomingdale’s. Though he declined
to give exact sales figures, Lane said that Lick Your
Chops sales rivaled sales of coffee, the department
store’ s best-selling food item.

“We’ ve always turned natural pet foods down be-
cause they were gimmicks,” Lane said. “We went with
this because it’s a whole program. It’s fresh, healthy and
fun ’9

The Goldsteins decided to go public with their ven-

ture seven years ago after they developed what they

said was a successful regimen for easing the pain of
their arthritic golden retriever.

Dog-lover’s idea a moving tribute

73y GLEN WARCHOL

SPOKANE, Wash.(UPI)I-— When

T Dan McDaniel learned a stroke had

paralyzed his beloved Blondie’s hind
quarters, he feared he would lose
the dog.

“I was pretty close to my little
dog,” McDaniel said, remembering

the sad September of 1985. “The '

diagnosis was that he was just get-
ting worse. But there was about zero
chance I was going to give up on my
little guy.”

The vets told McDaniel that

_' crude doggy wheelchairs were avail-
able, but they were so poorly de-

signed they would not recommend
Yet because the only alternative
was to destroy the 9-year-old cocka-

‘ poo, McDaniel strapped Blondie into
, one of the jerry-rigged two-wheeled
g" carts

“He couldn’t go anywhere. When

‘ he tried to do a dog thing, like hop
‘ “P on a curb, it fell over on him,”

McDaniel said. “It was more cruel

. than just letting him crawl.”.-'

Although McDaniel, 30, had no

- experience in working with metal, in
; desperation he began tinkering.

Working with a welder friend,

is Bill Jewett, McDaniel made one de-
; sign improvement right off, adding a
. set of “curb jumpers” in front of the

wheels. What came out of the work-
shop looked like a miniature chariot
with 8-inch wheels.

The moment of truth came when

he harnessed Blondie in the cart.
. with the dog’s useless rear legs care-

fully strapped out of harm’s way.
But as soon as the dog was

_ released, his front paws dug in and

he was rolling.

“Blondie loved it,” McDaniel
said. “He was off and gone. Blondie’
and I started running together, 2 to4
miles a day. Pretty soon, he was hu-
mongous in the front end.”

The “bionic” dog’s fame spread
and the Spokane Stroke Association
and the Rehabilitation Center, which
empathized with .Blondie’s joy of
mobility, made him their mascot.

Owners of crippled dogs started
calling, and about seven months ago,
McDaniel made the promise that led
to the founding of his dog wheel-
chair company in Spokane.

.“I promised these people I would
design a wheelchair that would work
for their dog,” he said. “It wasn’t as
easy as I thought, but I promised and
I had to come up with something.”_

Finally, he designed a fully ad-
justable doggy wheelchair that, by
swapping different lengths of alumi-
num or stainless steel stays, works
for any dog, from a Chihuahua to a
St. Bernard. .

At $110 to $225 for a “Freewheel-
er,” McDaniel found himself in busi-
ness,‘ which he calls “The Free-
wheeler.” '

“Fortunately there are people

like myself who will go to great

lengths for their dogs,” he said.

Of course, McDaniel admits,
other people, even some pet lovers,
don’t take to wheelchairs for dogs.

“Some people would look at
Blondie andsay to me, ‘How can you
be so cruel to put a dog in that
thing?’ _ ,

“Blondie would look up at them»
as if to say, ‘What’s your problem?’
He was back to a normal life of run-
ning and being a dog.”

Just about the time McDaniel’s
company, with Blondie as chief
salesman, was getting off the
ground, the c0ckapoo was stricken
with cancer. He died in November.

"This last year was just a bless-
ing for me and all the people that
met Blondie,” McDaniel said. “When
he died, my determination to help
other dogs increased a hundred-fold
because I had seen what it did for
him.” .

Blondie is buried in Family Pet
Memorial Garden in the rolling hills
north of Spokane. ~

McDaniel’s devotion to Blondie
may embarrass or bafﬂe many peo-
ple, but he makes no apologies.

“I love life. And I loved my dog,”
he said. “Blondie Was the best friend

. I ever had —— he wasn’t a disposable .

item.” - , ~
As for the Freewheelers, whic
McDaniel produces at slightly over
cost, “People need to know if their
dog has a problem, there doesn’t
have to be a sad ending.” ' '

Move Over, B ambi,
Here Come the Bulldozers "

et us pause and thank the folks at

the United States Fish and Wildlife _

Service. Were it not for their
ﬂinty-eyed vigilance, who knows
" how many Caterpillar bulldozers

. _ would be revving up for yet
'1 " another freeway land rape. At the
last moment our protectors have saved
us again, this time from the 35-mile
Springﬁeld Bypass in Fairfax County.
Thanks to a bureaucratic end run known
as a “supplemental environment study,”
the expressway spur may be stalled for
months, if not years, despite the clear
wishes of area residents, who recently
voted a $135 million bond issue to help
pay for the road.

The voters of Northern Virginia,
apparently believing the highway would
relieve traffic that is threatening to
paralyze the entire region in one
cataclysmic, big-daddy gridlock, failed to
notice a whole 20 acres of wetlands on
the route. For some people, “wetlands” is
a buzzword with the same emotional ﬂash
point as “nuclear winter” and “toxic
waste.”

And to top it off, wildlife has been
detected on the pathway. A government
biologist staggered out of the wilderness
to say he had discovered a
beaver colony and a herd of
white-tailed deer. How could we
even consider letting those
road-building swine bulldoze
Bambi and Bucky Beaver? Armed
with the news, the Fish and
Wildlife Service leapt into action.

Wait a minute. Can this be
real? Is a critically needed
highway going to be stalled on
the basis of a tiny wetlands area
and the presence of a few beaver
and deer? By 1995 there may be
more trafﬁc commuting around
the Beltway than into the
District. Local arterials such as
the Springfield Bypass may be

necessary to the economic health of the
entire area.

But, say our environmentally
concerned friends, what about the health
of wildlife? In the case of Virginia’s
white-tailed deer and beaver, they are
doing swimmingly, thank you. Robert W.
Duncan, assistant chief of the Game
Division of the Virginia Commission of
Game and Inland Fisheries, says the
state’s white-tailed-deer population
stands at about 600,000 animals and that
even an annual open-season hunting
harvest of 100,000 has not eliminated
the overpopulation problem. This is
leading to the ravages of disease as well
as an increase in highway accidents and
crop damage.

As for beavers in Virginia, more and
more complaints are reaching Duncan
about the feisty critters’ invading yards
and gnawing down prized trees and
saplings for their incessant dam
construction. “Sufﬁce it to say that we
have a tremendously healthy beaver
population,” he says.

Nevertheless, a few well-intentioned
bureaucrats have managed to bring a
major highway project to its knees with
some shameless sentimentalizing. To be

 

 

sure, the mindless building of
superhighways is stupid, especially when
millions of acres can be wasted with the
employment of ultrawide median strips
and ridiculously expansive Cloverleafs and
access ramps. Yet, our 40,000—mile
interstate system is the best in the world
and its creation was one of Dwight
Eisenhower’s prescient acts.

It’s easy to recall the hoopla over a
tiny ﬁsh called the snail darter, which
seemed to be threatened in the ’70s by
Tennessee dam builders. After all the
hand wringing and caterwauling had
ended, it was discovered that the little
fellows were thriving in their new home
downriver. Or do you remember the
plight of the caribou on Alaska’s North
Slope—noble creatures whose migratory
routes seemed to be interdicted by oil
pipelines? Word drifts down to the Lower
48 that the caribou have no problem with
the pipeline and congregate around its
stations, using them as caribou corner
drugstore hangouts.

As I write this, I am watching a
white-tailed doe feeding in the woods
outside my window. I have no urge to
shoot; I’m not a hunter. I wish her no
harm. Nor do I want her to starve to
death, which is her possible fate
now that man is her only
predator. We have too many
deer. We have plenty of beaver.
Based on the zealousness with
which they are being protected, I
am also sanguine about the
future of our wetlands.

On the other hand, it would
appear that Fairfax County

 

 

 

drivers are the real endangered
animals. People. there do not
have sufﬁcient roads to
accommodate the daily rush
hour. Who knows what toll we
are extracting on their families
and their health by allowing such
anguish to ﬂourish. I

My daughter is up all night, throwing up,

are like rubber. They flop in all directions.
‘ By next morning at the hospital her tem-

tell us she has 'bulbar polio. Bulbar, we are

family so that we can see her for the final
time. It is very emotional to file past her.

what was, a few short days ago, a happy,

the night. '

Morning comes and she is still here. She
is a fighter but the odds are bad. There is
nothing known about this dreaded disease,
gtgily the deaths and crippling of people of all

The private nurses are frightened and

reluctant to take our case. After all, they

have families, also, and what about them-

selves? t. j

The child is just barely breathing, her
chest is paralyzed, her throat is paralyzed
and her whole body is jerking with wild
spasms. The temperature remains and the
coma continues.

For five days, it’s touch and go. We never
go home, either the mother or father stays
in her tiny cubicle, nursing her, grabbing
catnaps and barely eating. At last, she
emerges from the coma-She is going to

To The Commercial Appeal:

According to your Jan. 20 report, theAudubon
Society’s winter .bird count indicates Memphis
“has had a significant loss in its bird population.”

Surely they didn’t count the blackbirds! .

Perhaps one reason for the decline in desir-
able bird species is the terrible increase in

numbers of the loud and raucous blackbirds'

which have invaded our neighborhoods.

It’s a well-known fact that, in addition to being
a public nuisance, these large ﬂocks can be the
source 0f serious health problems with their dis-
ease-bearing droppings. We should all urge our
public health officials to undertake a truly effec-
tive program to exterminate these birds. Certain-
1y, it does no good merely to chase a flock from one
roosting place to another. ' -

Then, perhaps, the purple finches and white-

faced such a formidable dog was in

Whitlow says, “was the fastest dog I

porches with guns, waiting to kill
it,” Whitlow says. After a year, the
dog simply disappeared.

The chow is not fast, but it is 1

wily. He rarely takes the same es-

dozen other officers closed in on the
chow’s favorite resting place in a
stand of pines between two rows of

watch Maine’s
new caribou

 

By Ellen J. Bartlett
Globe Staff

ORONO, Maine - The caribou lay
curled in the brittle winter sun, their
backs to the gusting wind, their oat-
meal-colored coats indistinguishable in
the blowing snow.

At the first hint of approaching hu—
mans, they abruptly materialized from
the whiteness, bounded away, then
turned to stare. As long as humans
were near, they continued to stare with
their brown eyes and to mill about ner—
vously.

It has been more than two months
since they were whisked away from
Newfoundland and brought to the Uni-
versity of Maine.

They live in a smaller world now, a
5-acre enclosure on the edge of campus,
shaded by tall white pines and hemlock
trees, deep in snow, bounded by a fence

made of wood and wire. Every day they AP hoto‘ '
are more distant from the deserted bogs p ‘

Their capture was the first major
step in an ambitious project to reestab-
lish woodland caribou in the wilds of
northern Maine. from which they van-
ished around the turn of the century.

Now is a time of waiting — for the
calves to be born in the spring, for the
next phase of the project to begin.

For the Caribou Transplant Corp.,
the organization behind the venture, it
also is a time for raising still more mon-
ey, for deﬂecting the critics and learn—

ing even more about the finer points of

publicity.

Since it was first suggested last
summer, this project has been lauded,
lambasted and debated. There was
some thought that things would ease
up after the caribou arrived, but that
apparently is. not to be.

There were deaths: Eight caribou”

died during the capture, two during the
1,300—mi1e journey from Newfound-
land, and three after arriving in Maine.

Skeptics continue to question
whether the project will survive on pri-

vate financing and predict that ulti-
mately the state will have to step in.

One of them is Rep. Ernest Green-
law (R—Standish), who has gone so far
as to introduce a bill in the Legislature
that would bar the Department of In—
land Fisheries and Wildlife from spend-
ing money or man hours on the cari—
bou.

“If anyone wants to spend their own
money on caribou, go ahead,” he said.
“My bill doesn't say it shouldn’t be
done. I’m saving it should not be fi-

nanced by the department."

In the February issue of Maine
Sportsman, publisher Jon Lund wrote
a column critical of those who would
launch a major wildlife project without
“any significant public discussion.”

“The idea of bringing back some—
thing that was here once is very appeal-
ing," he said, but “there are a lot of
nuts and bolts kinds of things we could
be devoting our energy to rather than a

gee—whiz project like the caribou."
But those who are working on
the project. point out that they are
surviving on the money they have
raised. For every critic, they say,
there are scores who have been
captivated by the idea of a magni—
ficent and graceful wilderness spe-
cies making an encore appearance
in their state.

Roles being shifted

Wildlife biologist Mark McCul—
lough was hired as the project
leader to oversee care and man—
agement of the caribou and to or-
ganize research. But his time is
taken up in answering phone calls
and .letters, addressing Kiwanis

‘ clubs and appearing on television.

 

 

 

The caribou have joined the
planetarium and the museum on
the list of campus attractions, so
he gets school kids on field trips,
Brownies and Cub Scouts. On the
second Saturday of every month,
the public is invited. McCullough
estimates that 5,000 people have
come to see the caribou.

They also see a sign, in plain

view on the back of the feed shel-i
ter, a reminder that the project is

financed privately. Visitors have
donated $600 in small change.

The Caribou Transplant Corp.
recently kicked off a fund-raising
campaign with an initial target of
$65,000, the estimated annual
cost for upkeep of the herd. Once
the offspring of this nursery herd
are released and research on them

begins, annual costs are expected
to increase to more than
$100,000.

So far, the Maine Audubon So—
ciety has received $80,000 on be~
half of the corporation. Most. of
that money has been spent, and
there are major costs coming, in-
cluding funding the promised
transfer_ of 15 caribou in New—
foundland next September and
building a 10-acre addition to the
caribou enclosure.

There also are major decisions
to be made: Where to place the
caribou calves when they are
ready to be released? Who will ac-
cept responsibility for them once
they are released? When should
they be released, and how?

McCullough is writing a re-
search and management plan for
the project. He said the plan
should have been written and
some of these questions should
have been answered earlier.

Trying to catch up

“We did put the cart before the

horse. We’ve got the caribou; now
we’re trying to catch up," he said.
But he does not have a lot of time
to look back on what should have
been. His primary responsibility is
taking care of the caribou now.

Every morning at 8, he arrives

for morning feeding. Their diet
consists of pellets made of com-

pacted grain, alfalfa, vitamins.

and minerals, and a dash of mo-
lasses for flavor. The mixture was
specially formulated in Alaska for
caribou adapting to captivity.

 

 

It has not been an easy transi—
tion. The hunt was plagued by
poor weather and other problems.
Instead of 30 caribou as they had
planned, the Mainers left New—
foundland with only 27. Five of
those later died,‘including one of
the three stags. .

One of the two remaining stags
also was ailing but is recovering:
now. He has been separated from
the others and put on a special
diet of lichens. Because caribou
are sociable animals, the other
stag was placed in the pen to keep
him company. A doe tagged along.

There are some who say the ’

problems could have been avoided
if the project had been delayed a
year. But others say that prob-
lems are inevitable in an ambi—
tious experiment.

Pose the question to Glenn

Manuel, who as commissioner of;
inland fisheries and wildlife,“ was .

«O

the primary force propelling the .

project forward.

“We have an awful lot of nega—' ’

tive thinking people in this state,”

Manuel said. “When people try to,’ -

do something different, all they do

is sit around and criticize, and say, '

it won't work."

With a new administration in:

Hounding Dog About Genealogy

.

HAT DOG Greg Petroski is
holding may look like a mutt,
but she’s one in a million.

Billie got a letter saying so. Yes, I
said the dog got the letter.

Greg read it to her. They both
howled.

The letter is from Halbert’s Inc. It
starts:

Dear Friend.

As you may already know, we
have been doing some work relating
to people who have the same last
name as you do. Finally, after
months of work, we are ready to
publish THE AMAZING BILLIE
NEW WORLD REGISTRYand you '
are in it!

The Billie name is very rare and
our research has shown that less
than one in every one million people
in the New World share the Billie
name.

It doesn‘t say how many dogs.

We have spent a great deal of ef-
fort and thousands of dollars to re-
search through over 100 million re-
cords in Europe, Canada, the United
States andAustralia. . . .

Only dogged research turned
up this information.

- THE AMAZING BILLIE NEW
WORLD RE 615 TR Y features this
valuableand extensive directory of
Billies living throughout the New
World. . . .

That’s not all. Billie could take a
heritage tour to her homeland.

And, if Billie could read, she
would see other amazing topics in
the registry:

(I) Where Billie families live to-
day and how many there are in dif-
ferent parts of the New World.

(2) Why your forebears left their
European birthplace. _ .

(3) Ne ver-before-published infor-
mation about the Billie population in
various countries.

(4) How you can search for your
ancestry and trace your Billie fam-
ily tree. . . .

This is a “first edition,” “a rare
and valuable acquisition,” and “the
only publication of its kind in the
world.”

It’s also $19.95 plus $1.88 shipping
and handling.

Barb and Greg, Billie’s owners,
did not realize they had such a dis-
tinguished dog. .

Does your dog have papers?
“No, she’s housebroken,” Barb

said. “Billie is a mixed breed, part
dachshund, part schnauzer, but
mostly spare parts."

Then Billie is more than the sum
of her parts?

“You could say that. Her family
does go back to Europe —— dachs-
hunds and schnauzers are German.
If Halbert’s can trace it, that’s a real
feat. She’s a stray. The only family
tree Billie has is the maple in the
yard.”

How did Billie get this amazing
offer? Barb thinks she knows.

“Billie’s in the phone book. We
wanted an unlisted number, but
there was an extra charge. We
didn’t want to pay it.

“The phone company said we had
to list a member of the household.

Billie’s one of the family. So we used
our dog’s name: I.C. Billie."

That makes her a front pooch.

“It‘s great for screening telephone
salesmen," Barb said. “It’s a dead
giveaway when they ask for Mrs.
Billie.”

To protect the guilty, this column
will bring you a first: I’ve used Greg
Petroski’s real name, but changed
the dog’s. There is no I.C. Billie in
the phone book. Greg and Barb are
afraid you’ll read this article, and
plague them with funny phone calls

Now, let me give you Halbert’s
pedigree. A few years ago, Halbert’s
(or one of several other names it
uses) was turning out “The Amazing
Story of (Your Family Name) in
America.”

People complained that this
Amazing Story was really some gen-
eral history and a list of folks with
that same last name. Many of those
names seemed to be from the phone

.book.

A false representation order was
filed by the post office, saidinspec-
tor Stan Wood.

The result?

The court decided Halbert’s was
not producing history or genealogy,

but a registry of names, Wood said.

There Was a consent decree. Hal-
bert’s agreed the Amazing Story
should be called the Amazing Regis-
try. Then it wouldn’t be
misrepresentation.

Amazing.

It was time to ask Halbert’s about
their pet project. I talked with a
young man in customer service.

He said he couldn’t tell me any-
thing about Billie’s family name.

“I don’t have that information on
that specific family,” customer ser-
vice said. “The master is at the
printer’s right now.”

Does Halbert’s know one of those

CHOCTAW BEACH (UPI) — For

has been killed by someone appar-
ently seeking the animal’s meat, au-

j The deer apparently was killed
in his shelter over the weekend, then
fdragged under a fence. Authorities
jthink someone slaughtered the

, “I "would’ve given someone
$1,000 if they had left Bambi alone
and were that hungry,” Susan Beech
told the Fort Walton Beach Play-
Jround Daily News. “Bambi was just
like my baby.” .
Beech began raising the deer
nine years ago after it was brought
to a Niceville veterinarian’s office.
Beech recalled that the fawn had
been hit by a vehicle or attacked by
dogs.

Beech, her husband and two chil-
dren kept Bambi in a fenced yard
behind their home. They built a shel-
ter so the deer could escape from
the elements during bad weather.

Beech said the deer, which never

 

regained full use of his hind legs,
was popular in the community. She
said on weekends many children
and adults would drop by to see
«Bambi.
' “He would walk up to anyone,”
‘ she told the newspaper.
“Saturday morning‘I whistled

Beech, Vilfi noticed nothing amiss
until she went to feed the deer later.

Beech said she found bloodstains
in the shelter, then found more
bloodsiains on the ground. The for-

Animal Research Helps Pets and Their Masters

As dean of the state’s only veterinary
medical college, I am concernedthat
many Floridians are unaware that re-
search conducted with the use of animals
benefits their pets, as well as humans.

Many of the latest diagnostic tech-
niques and treatments we employ at the
University of Florida Veterinary Medical
Teaching Hospital (a state referral hospi-
tal for animals) were developed through
animal research, applied in human medi-
cine and later used to treat animals. Ex-
amples developed at Florida include:

Recycled human pacemakers to cor-
rect heart rhythm disorders in dogs.

Ultrasonic imaging techniques, such
as echocardiography, for accurate detec-
tion of disease.

A non-surgical procedure to remove
kidney stones from dogs.

Open-heart surgery in dogs and other
animals.

Corneal transplants in dogs and
horses.

Skin graft procedures to treat severe
wounds in small pets and large animals.

Arthroscopic surgery to treat‘ knee in-
juries in thoroughbred racehorses.

Animals Placed
Above Humans

Where are our priorites? Abortions
and living human babies do not receive
nearly the amount of clamor and concern
as the pound seizure issue. It appears we
would fight one another to the death over
the welfare of animals.

Adaptations of life-support systems
used in human neonatal intensive care to
save the lives of critically ill newborn
foals. j

Additionally, procedures originally de-
veloped in animals for human medicine
are helping to save endangered wildlife.

One example is Big Guy, endangered
Florida panther, who underwent life-sav-
ing corrective orthopedic surgery at the
University of Florida to implant a steel
plate after he had been hit by a car in the
Everglades.

Our veterinary students, who spend
four years preparing to treat many ani-
mal species with everything from internal
parasites to trauma-related injuries, per-
fect their skills in examination and sur-
gery by performing procedures on teach-
ing animals under proper anesthesia. This
training assures expert veterinary care
for Florida’s pets and livestock when our
students graduate.

When people bring their ailing dogs,
cats, horses, cows and other animals to
our hospital for treatment, they expect
the best possible and most advanced vet-
erinary care available.

Many diseases which remain difficult

to treat, such as glaucoma, dog bloat, can-
cer, and navicular disease in horses, are
the subjects of ongoing animal research
in our UF Colleges of Medicine and Vet-
erinary Medicine.

Animal research has significantly ac-

counted for the rapid progress of clinical
veterinary medicine since the 19405.
Complex diagnostic and therapeutic
methods developed in research animals
years ago are now applied directly to the
same species by local veterinarians.

The large, costly epidemics of conta-

gious diseases in large and small animals
are now, for the most part, history -—
thanks to applied research and the devel-
opment of safe and effective vaccines.

Animal research is a vital component

of the college’s mission and ensures our
patients (people’s pets) will have the best
possible health care.

Beloved Pets Could

Go for Research

Suppose a very much loved family dog
has gotten lost, wandered for weeks and is
finally picked up by the animal control
department 30 miles from where the own-
ers live.

In the dog’s wanderings, he has lost
his identification tag. He is so far afield of
the owners’ “search operation” that the
owners do not check in this area.

When his “hold” time has expired, he
could be taken to an animal experimenta-
tion lab, subjected to pain, bewilderment

. and almost certainly an excruciatingly,

lonely death.
People should vote against pound sei-
zure.

. Using Animals Now .
ls Invaluable Later

As a University of South
Florida/ Veterans Administration otola-
ryngologist heavily involved in research, I

strongly advocate the use of pound ani-
mals for research purposes.

An important part of the College of
Medicine’s ENT residents’ training is our
annual bronchoesophageal / endoscopy
course, in which the residents have

. hands-on experience retrieving objects
1 from the throats of anesthetized cats or
9‘ dogs. These animals are not injured by

this experience.

This experience later proves invalu-
able to the doctor in the hospital emer-
gency room when he has to quickly re-
move a foreign body from the esophagus
or windpipe of a choking child.

LETTERS :

Many Experiments Have No Research Value

Comments made by members of the
Board of Regents concerning therupcom-
ing referendum on the fate of Hillsbor-
ough County pound animals reported re-

cently in the Tallahassee Democrat and '

elsewhere show that the regents are ei-
ther misinformed or unwilling to be re-
sponsive to the demands of the majority

of taxpayers in this state who support the
universities. .

The regents encouraged the voters of
Hillsborough County to remain the only
county in Florida to permit the county
pound to supply former pets to the univer-
sities to be used as lab animals. Their
statements supporting this position
ranged from inconsistent to just plain
ludicrous.

Board Chairman T. Terrell Sessums
claimed that denying the school of these
animals would result in the death of even
more animals, because the universities
would have to buy the animals from out-
side sources. Apparently, state university
Chancellor Charles Reed disagrees fOr he
states that the cost of buying animals
from other sources would be prohibitive.

Marshall Criser, University of Florida
president, believes that his faculty has

been abused by a very small group of peo-
ple.

He absurdly added that artificial heart
transplants would have been impossible
without the use of dogs supplied by a
pound. I graduated from Florida State
University with a major in biology. I also
spent considerable time at the University
of Florida majoring in animal science.
During my education at both universities
I was involved in and witnessed numerous
experiments using animals which had ab-
solutely no research value.

The animals were brutally mutilated

These experiments are designed to teach
the students information — already ac-

research. Virtually all of those few ex-
periments for research are repetitive and
not capable of producing any new scien-
tific information. I found these experi-
ments astonishingly cruel even though I
had grown accustomed to witnessing ago-
nizing death at my off-campus job as a
veterinarian’s assistant.

This incredible waste of life and enor-

endless supply of cheap animals from the

purchase the animals they would cer-
tainly be more discriminating and respon-
sible in choosing the experiments which
have scientific value and also in choosing
the number of animals needed for the ex-
periment.

The current regulations are too broad
and leave too much discretion to the uni-
versities to provide any significant protec-
tion to the animals. Therefore, eliminat-
ing the supply of pound animals would re-
sult in fewer, not more deaths.

I challenge Criser to publish a list of
all the animals currently being used as
lab animals, the purpose of these experi-
ments, and the possible medical break-
throughs they will result in.

I challenge him to let members of the
media tour the facilities and view experi-

tice. The results of these challenges
would be more shocking than anything I
could write.

I believe there are many people, like
myself, who are not animal rights activ-

I strongly urge the voters of Hillsbor—

these helpless animals to needless torture
by the universities. I also urge all contrib-

Activist. says proposed clinic
would ‘benefit the animals’

By JIM SLOAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA — Animal rights activist Raini Sequoya
wants to open up a free animal spay and neuter clinic at
the University of South Florida — a clinic, he said,
where medical students learn to save animal lives, not
take them. ,

" He said he’s come up with a peace offering in the

battle over medical school use of county pound animals.

A USF official said the only thing Sequoya has come
up with is another way to get his name in the newspaper.
His plan, Sequoya said, would benefit USF, the com-
munity and the hundreds of pound animals USF uses an-
nually for teaching surgical techniques.
. . “The way it is now, every place you turn it’s destruc-
tion of a life form,” he said. “Let’s turn that around to
benefit the animals.”
g Under Sequoya’s plan, licensed local veterinarians,
donating a day a weekiof their time, would oversee a
free spay and neuter clinic at USF.

Under the vets’ supervision, USFmedical students
Lwould observe the operations and, eventually, partici-
pate in them.

National Animal Rights, Inc., which Sequoya heads,
Would provide free transportation to and from the clinic.
' The plan would cut down the stray animal popula-
tion, Sequoya said, and allow the pound animals USF
uses for teaching to die a humane death by lethal injec-
tion.

USF medical students would also learn more, Se-
quoya said.

“They are going to take it much more seriously he ,

cause a life is at stake,” he said. “This animal will be-
long to a person, a member of the c0mmunity.”

Sally Padgett, spokeswoman for USF’s medical
school, called Sequoya’s pr0posal a “publicity ploy.”

‘ “There are a million reasons why this would not
work, and Raini Seqona knows them,” she said. “He’ll
say anything just to get his name in the paper.”

First, she said, USF can by law only accept animals
from federally registered dealers like the county pound,
not the general public.

Next, extensive pre—operation workups would be re-
quired on each animal, she said, and the USF committee
that oversees animal research would have to study and
approve each operation.

“Can you imagine how much time that would take?”
she asked.

. Finally, she said, although the university would like
to see all animals spayed or neutered, “We are not vet-

erinarians. This is a medical school, not a veterinary
school.”

Dr. Walter Woolf, a spokesman for the Hillsborough
County Veterinary Medical Society on the pound animal
research issue, said Sequoya’s plan was a “cheap shot.”

“What he is proposing is the unlicensed, unregulated
practice of veterinary medicine,” Woolf said. “He’s
cheapening it. He’s taking a cheap shot at the veterinary ,
profession and he’s insulting the intelligence of the com— 5
munity.”

Woolf said vets give people who get their pets spayed
or neutered a $20 rebate if the pet is licensed.

Sequoya said USF is already practicing surgery on
pound animals without a license. “The difference with
my pr0posal,” he said. “is that you’re saving animals, not
killing them.” L

USF officials claim it would cost $250,000 a year for ‘
specially bred animals if the school’s supply of pound
animals were cut off. That money, much of it saved
under his proposal, could be used to fund the clinic, Se-
quoya said. ‘

. TAMPA — It started with pic-
i tures of pain-racked monkeys
strapped to cages, the caption blar-
ing “This Is Vivisection.”

It escalated to photographs of a

sad-eyed young girl, kept alive by a

pacemaker in her chest. “Her Hope
for Life,” the brochure was head-
lined, “is in Ycur Hands.”

Today, in the latest of a series of
pre-election salvos before county
voters decide next month whether
stray pound animals should be used
for medical research, a group of ter-
minally ill peonle will tell reporters
at a news confererree their only hope

are cures found through animal re-
search.

The news conference and bro-
chure had one antepound animal re-
search leader seereg red Wednesday
about the other side's “scare tac-
tics.”

A pro-reseereh spokeswoman
says that’s too bur? -- it’s only fight-
ing fire with fir-r27.

“It’s underhsnded and they
shouldn’t be allrrrred to do it,” said
Humane Society Director Phil
Snyder of today"::2 news conference
and the heart-w: enching brochures
sent to voters. '1' ey’re trying to win
by giving people irre choice between
life and death.”

Sally___PadgetL SBQltsgﬂoman for

the University of South Florida
Medical School, which uses pound
animals for reseer’ch, said such tac-
tics are no worse than gory pictures
of vivisected marekeys.

“They’ve used. photographs that
were taken in the ’403 and ’505,” she
said of animal rights activists.
“That’s the worst kind of emotional-
ism. -

“If he finds this news conference
emotional and distasteful, that’s
tough.”

 

Today’s news conference at Bay-
shore Baptist Church Fellowship
Hall is sponsored by the Incurably
111 for Animal Research, a national
group based in Tucson, Ariz. '

The grannies nothing to do with

USF, Padgett said. The patients will

‘ present “factual information” about

the animal research issue.

“This issue is a matter of life and
death to a lot of people,” Padgett.
said. “I don’t see that as emotional-
ism.”

Mary Repper of Safety Harbor,
spokeswoman for the IIFAR, called
Snyder’s complaints laughable.

“That’s absolutely hysterical,”
she said. “Their entire argument is
based on emotionalism.” -

Repper said the animal research
issue really does boil down to life or
death.

“We have children out there who
are dying,” she said. “It does come
down to human life vs. animal life.”

The public, she said, has a right
to hear from incurably ill patients,
“people who are living and breath-
ing this issue every day.”

' The cost of the news conference
will be two round-trip tickets from
Tucson, to fly in the IIFAR director
and executive director, Repper said.

Meanwhile, a local group, the
Committee to Protect Medical Re-
search, has published a brochure
supporting pound animal research.

The cover story and photograph
is about Lilah Koch, a 6-year-old
Tampa girl who has had a pace-
maker since she was 4 weeks old.

“Lilah owes her life to medical

research,” the brochure says. “With-
out it, she would be dead now.”
3 The brochure pleads for a yes
vote March 3 “so people will live.”
To Snyder, the inference is obvi-
ous: People who don’t want to supply
pound animals to USF don’t care
about human life.

, “They’ve accused animal rights
activists of putting too much emo-

tionalism into this issue,” he said of
the pro-research faction. “Now,
they’ve got people scared to death
that someone is going to die.

“I think this thing is getting so
bent out of shape it’s ridiculous.”

Medical research won’t stop if
use of pound animals is banned,
Snyder said.

“The issue is whether Animal
Control (the county pound) should
be a supply house for medical re-
search, not to debate whether a little
girl will die or not,” he said.

Faced with such tactics, he said,

his options are tough.

“What do I do?” he asked. “Go
on the radio and debate this little
girl with a pacemaker, or the people
who are coming here with terminat
diseases?“ , ‘

Padgett countered that, although
medical research won’t end, it will
be curtailed greatly, delaying vital
medical advances that could save
lives.

No one is more qualified to talk
about the issue, she said, than people
who face death unless medical sci-
ence finds answers.

“It is a matter of life and death
to them,” she said.

Pound" SeiZure:
Pain in the Heart

Pound seizure is so wrong it creates a
pain in the heart of most thinking human
beings. The suffering, agony, fear and
feelings of abandonment this practice
generates in some of God’s most wonder-
ful creatures is not only cruel, it is im-
moral.

 

 

 

Surely, in the name of decency and

common sense, pound seizure must be
stopped.

BEE O’MALLEY

Would Animal
Research Stop?

On March 3, Hillsborough County 1
voters will decide the issue of pound sei-
zure. To help the voter make an informed
decision, the following are the answers to
the most asked questions on pound sei-
zure. ,

Aren’t these animals going to die any-
way?

It was shown in court during the hear-
ing to get an injunction temporarily stop-
ping pound seizure, that the Hillsborough

 

County animal control, after holding an
animal for the required five days, will re-

lease the animal to the University of
South Florida without allowing the public '

an opportunity to adopt the animal.

If we end pound seizure, won’t all re-
search end?

Currently 1? states prohibit pound sei-
zure. One of these states is Massachusetts.
Massachusetts is one of the best medical
research areas in the country. How then,
if it is true that all research will end with
pound seizure, are the medical facilities

of Massachusetts able to conduct their

breakthrough research?

If pound seizure ends, won’t taxpayers

pay more for research?

As the public loses trust and confi-
dence in our local animal control, people
will start to release their unwanted ani-
mals on the streets to fend for them-
selves. As these uncontrolled animals
reproduce, it will increase our communi-
ty’s pet overpopulation problem. This Will

. add to the cost of controlling strays.

Voters should get out and vote no to
end pound seizure on March 3.

Program unites pets, people

By MICHAEL SZNAJDERMAN
Tribune Staff Writer

LARGO — Word gets around
fast at Wright’s Nursing Home
when it’s visiting time.

Residents, some who rely on
walkers and many in wheelchairs,
post themselves in their bedroom
doorways. They peer down the hall

anxiously, their eyes focused on .
the main entrance. Others gather ,
in small groups and crane their“

necks toward the reception area.
“We lOOk forward to seeing
them,” said one elderly woman in
a wheelchair. “Icried today be-
cause one of them reminded me so

much of Duke.

“He was brown and about so

high,” the woman went on, drawing

an imaginary line about two feet
g from the floor with her hand. “He

used to put his head on my lap.”

At least once a week, some-
times more often, volunteers pay a
visit to Wright’s. But it’s what the
volunteers bring along that isvso ea-
gerly awaited. The 130 volunteers
are pet owners who’ve joined Pro-
ject PUP, or “Pets Uplifting Peo-
p e.” \

The program reaches nearly all
of Pinellas County’s nursing homes,
about 75 at last count, allowing
some 7,500 elderly residents coun-
tywide the chance to pet, hug or be
licked by a dog or cat.

. has been launched in Hillsborough

doesn’t speak — that is, to people.
“The first time I came in with Sa-
ber, she started talking with the
dog,” said Karen Wilson, a veteri-
nary technology student who, with
her Siberian husky, has been a Pro-
ject PUP volunteer for about five
months.

“Everyone told me Margaret
doesn’t talk,” Wilson said, laughing.
“She won’t talk to humans. She
talks to the dog.”

Yates tells of a resident at an-
other nursing home who “sat in her
wheelchair, in the corner, chewing
on her blanket and making animal
sounds.” But when a first-time vol-
unteer entered the room with her
pet cat, the elderly woman immedi-
ately responded: “Oh, what pretty

, kitty!”

A nurSe who had worked in the
nursing home for two years was as-
tounded. “I didn’t know she could

talk,” she told the volunteer.

So far, Project PUP has proved
to be rewarding for almost every-
one involved.

“The resident benefits, and the
volunteer benefits,” Yates ex-
plained. “The feedback has been
phenomenal.”

Nancy Cooksley, activities di-
rector at Wright’s, said, “What
makes this program special is that

'it reaches every one ,in every

room. Every person who likes pets

. can get the. chance to visit. That’s
one of the real benefits.’

Belcourt left a nursing home there,
where pets were prohibited. At

' night, his wife used to sneak the

family dog into his room.

“The animals make it nice for

~,_everyone," Belcourt explained.
'.';“Penny always looks for me. She
“:goes into the room and sniffs

.around. And if I’m not there, she

" comes looking.”

Project PUP volunteers and

. . .their pets must go through a rigid
.;screening process before they are
[admitted to the program, Yates ex-
plained. “The pets must be able to

deal with wheelchairs, walkers,
--screaming people, petting by peo-
.ple with shaky hands. They’ve got

to be Stable pets and stable volun-

teers.”

The screening process has paid
off: Since the program began, there

being launched in Orange and Mar-

Pet therapy is a relatively new
idea, but the benefits, according to,
researchers and participants in
pet-therapy programs, can be ex-

program has been operating about

“Wouldn’t you like being petted

of Largo, who brought three of her
Labradors to Wright’s on a recent
Wednesday.

“I think a lot of older people
and the handicapped are neglected
when it comes to love,” said Cabel-
lo, who brought along her 19-year-
old daughter to help with the dogs.
“I also breed dogs,” she added. “I
like to give to people what these

Betty Luttier, a volunteer who
regularly brings her terrier, Tam-

“This volunteer work combines
all the best things in life — dogs
and people,” Luttier said while ad-

nursing homes indicates that most
allow pet visits, through Project

THE ARIZONA REPUBLIC

Trapped

Surprise pastor dabbles in ‘most skillful Sport’

By BEA CARLTON
Special tor The Republlc

John E. Ahrenberg, pastor of l
New Covenant Church in Sur-
prise, has an unusual sideline for a
minister. He is a trapper.

Ahrenberg, an Arizona native,
_ said he has hunted and ﬁshed all-
his life but began trapping only
ﬁve or six years ago.

“A friend told me about it and
showed me how to set a trap,” he
said. “Then I went down to the
' trapper’s supply in Mesa and
bought traps and books on trap-‘
ping. The ﬁrst year was spent in
learning -— trial and error.

“This is the most skillful sport I
have eVer done. Imagine all the
thousands of acres, and I’m trying
to get an animal to step on this
,little inch-and-a-half mound of
dirt.”

It is also a part.time income.
Ahrenberg sells furs. Most of the
approximately 1,600 trappers in'
Arizona only trap part-time, --
though there are some full-time
government trappers and a few
others. The part-time trappers
come from every walk of life.

The pastor only traps the four'
winter months —— November

through February - when the fur '

is the heaviest and prettiest. Most

of the furs end up overseas, he
said. Bobcat is the most expensive

and could bring the trapper $200

for a large, well-marked skin.

Light-colored coyotes are more-
valuable than red, bringing about
$25 as compared to the $5 to $6

paid for a red coyote skin. Buyers "

pay an average of $22 for a gray
fox. Ring~tailed cat and raccoon
skins are also salable, but skunks
are almost worthless, as are the
extremely hard to skin, fat-lay-
ered badgers.

Ahrenberg says he has no'
remorse about trapping animals,
though he is strong on doing it as
humanely as possible. .

“They were put here for the use'
of man,” he said. He said he feels
there is no difference in trapping
animals for their skins and killing
domestic animals for food.

He is quick to point out that all
the animals he traps are preda-
tory. These animals, such as foxes,
coyotes, bobcats and badgers,
survive by killing other animals.

“A little coyote is cute, but it is
its nature to kill,” he said. “The
coyote is the leeriest and smartest .
animal that Arizona has, maybe in
the world. They are everywhere in

. Arizona.

“Ask sheepherders if coyotes
kill their sheep. They lose hun-
dreds to them. They’ll down a

' sheep, kill it, and it’s their nature

to be greedy. They’ve done with- ;
out food for a week and a half. {
One coyote might kill 20 or 30 ;

sheep at one time.

“I trap coyotes and open their
stomachsand ﬁnd parts of sheep, ‘

sol know they eat sheep.

" “A coyote will even kill a fox
and eat it. Even one another. 1;.

have had coyotes completely de-:
vour kit foxes I caught in my "

traps, nothing left but fur and a

few bones.

“A sheepherder’s motto is: Eat '
,mutton, a million coyotes can
wrong. It is a service to sheep-.

herders to kill coyotes; they kill

hundreds of sheep a year. It is

estimated there are a million
coyotes in Maricopa County alone.

It takes a lot of meat to feed a

million coyotes!”

Most predators hunt at night so

they are seldom seen.

Shrimpers don't want turtle

By KEN LANTERMAN
Post Reporter

 

SAN BERNARD RIVER —
Shrimper David Turner wrinkled
his nose and nudged the “thing”
with his toe as though it were
some foul-smelling, never-before-
seen sea creature that had 11st
washed ashore.

“That’s the first time I’ve seen
one of those things, and I don’t
want to see no more,” Turner said
shaking his head. Four other
shrimpers who had gathered
around to get their first look at the
thing all shook their heads aid
muttered in agreement. _

The cause of all this consterna-
tion‘and revulsion is a contraption
called a “TED,” short for “turtle
excluder device.” Designed at a
cost of $3.5 million by the federal
government, the TED —- when
sewn into a shrimper’s net — is
supposed to allow sea turtles and
unprofitable trash fish to escape
from the net.

' For nearly 10 years, environ-
mentalist groups and agencies of
the federal government concerned
about the threatened extinction of

various species of sea turtle, in-
cluding the Kemp’s Ridley turtle,
have been urging shrimpers to vol-
untarily use the TEDs. But to no
avail.

The shrimpers now face the pos-
sibility (perhaps as early as mid—
May) of being forced by the feder-
al government to use the TEDs or
keeping their boats tied at the
dock until they do. Either option,
the shrimpers say, threatens them
— not the sea turtles — with ex-
tinction.

“All those lily-livered environ-

mentalists worry about are snakes

and turtles and snail-darters,”
says shrimper Earl Fayard.
“What about that poor deckhand
who makes a living on our boats?
What about us?”

Shrimpers like Fayard, espe-
cially the independents who Oper—
ate the smaller boats, have a host
of complaints about the TEDs. But
chief among these are three: They
fear it is going to let too many
shrimp escape, it poses a safety
hazard and that considering the
few turtles they catch in their
nets, the device is an unwarranted
nuisance.

“The thing’s got too many
holes,” says Mike Elrod, who has
used the TED for six months.
“When you see a hole in a net, you
are supposed to sew it.”

But the TED, a box-like net
filled with trapdoors, is actually a

'help, rather than a hindrance, say

the environmentalists.

“It should really be called the
‘Trawling Efficiency Device,’ ”
says Carole Allen, director of
HEART (Help Endangered Ani-
mals-Ridley Turtles), a Houston-
based conservation group. “The
TEDs help the shrimper by sorting
out some of the garbage that gets
caught in their net.”

Elrod concedes that the TED
does remove some of the debris
from the net, but that it also has
the potential of allowing unwanted
debris to lodge itself between the

'net and a trapdoor, which would

permit all his catch to escape.
“I’ll agree with them (the envi-
ronmentalists) that it doesn’t hurt
production — in general — but
that’s only under ideal conditions,
and buddy you hardly ever have ‘

excluders




ideal conditions out here in the
Gulf,” says Elrod, who is organiz-
ing opposition to the TED and
raising money for a possible law-
suit. .

Elrod and some other shrimpers
may give the other side the benefit
of the doubt when it comes to the
question of whether the TED will
hurt their production, but they are
unyielding when it comes to talk-
ing about its hazards.

“When that thing is brought up
on board,” says Lloyd Buckheit,
“it hangs about head high. When
those smaller boats get to rocking
back and forth, those things could
be dangerous — going to hit some-
body in the head.”

He adds if it’s a deckhand who
gets hurt, he has the potential to
sue the shrimper. And if the suit
won’t put him out of business, the
increased costs of insurance will,
he says.

“Shirmping’s already a danger-
ous business,” he says. “Why take
on more risk?”

But perhaps the biggest com-
plaint coming from these tough-
minded and independepent
shrimpers is that the TED is a
nusiance.

“I’ve only caught four turtles in
three years,” says Johnny Finley.
“And they were dumped back over
alive.”

That may not sound like much,
Allen says, but if Finley’s experi-
ence is typical of the 5,000
shrimpers in the Gulf of Mexico,
that is a serious threat to the tur-
tie species.

“If everyone just caught one or
two a year, that would be a drastic
blow — especially if they catch'
one of the 500 (Kemp’s Ridely)

. breeding females,” Allen says.

An estimated 47,000 turtles are
caught in shrimper’s nets each
year in the Gulf of Mexico and
Atlantic Ocean, according to Mi-
chael Weber, director of the ma-
rine habitat program for the Cen-
ter for Environmental Education,
a Washington, D.C.-based conser-
vation group. Of that number,
11,000 die.

Weber’s 100,000-member organi-
zation is credited with prompting
the federal government into action
on this issue. CEE’s threat of a
lawsuit last August against the
National Marine Fisheries Serv-
ice, responsible for protecting the
sea turtle under the Endangered
Species Act, set off a series of ne;
gotiations between members of the
shrimping industry, the govern-
ment and environmentalist
groups. “

The negotiations, which ended
in December, resulted in a series
of proposed regulations on the
shrimping industry that should
take effect in mid-May if all goes
according to schedule, ii’eber

says.

_ promises.

 

\

The only roadblock that could
prevent the regulations from be-
coming law is the lawsuit being
discussed by the angry shrimpers,
Weber says. He adds that to be
sucessful, the shrimpers would
have to convince the court that the
TEDs pose an undue economic
burden, which Weber feels is
groundless.

Nevertheless, Elrod and the oth-
ers plan to do all they can to de-
feat the TED.

“If they want a stink, well, we’ll
sure as hell give ’em one,” Elrod

THE HOUSTON POST - February 16, 1987

Maybe ’only a rat'to some,
but Clarabelle’s a good pet

"SPCA staff adopted this intelligent little rodent for its own

uring my lifetime, I have had the pleasure of
owning a variety of animal pets such as dogs,
cats, horses, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters,
chickens, goats, pigeons, pigs, ducks, canaries, cattle
and a miscellany of sick or injured exotic critters
which happened to cross my path.

One particular animal, the rat, never made it onto
my list of pets. Having been raised on a farm, I al-
ways considered rats one of our biggest enemies.
They carry disease organisms of bubonic plague, ty-
phus and various foodborne diseases. Rats harbored

. the ﬂeas which carried the disease-causing organ-
isms for the bubonic plague that killed 25 million peo-
ple in 14th-century Europe.

My thoughts about rats usually focused on a dirty,
dumb, diseased, and extremely ugly creature living
in a sewer or some other unsanitary surroundings.

“Clarabelle” has altered my thinking on this sub-
ject, which clearly demonstrates that one is never too

old to change. Clarabelle is a 2-year-old domesticated ' ‘" “

rat who, along with several other adult rats, was -
dropped off at the Houston SPCA about ayear ago.
The previous owner could no longer keep them.

Shortly thereafter, homes were found for each of
the pet rats except Clarabelle. It didn’t take an ex-
pert to determine that Clarabelle was pregnant, and,
considering the average rat litter ranges from 8 to 12,
no one was interested in getting this involved in the
rat business.

SPCA employees provided Clarabelle with a nice
nesting cage complete with straw bedding, exercise
equipment, gravity-fed water bottle and food contain-
er. Clarabelle responded to this tender, loving care
with seven babies. Each SPCA employee and volun-
teer became more and more interested in Clarabelle
“and her skinny little offspring.

Needless to say, Clarabelle loved this attention and
responded as most companion pets respond. She al-
ways greets people with a lazy yawn as if to say, “It’s
playtime so take me out of this cage.” The baby rats
were weaned in about 4 weeks and then placed for ad-
doption. They were quickly adopted by several fam-
ilies who appreciate the benefits of owning pet rats.

Since Clarabelle was no longer involved with the
responsibilities of motherhood, a suggestion was
made that she be placed for adoption. This suggestion
was quickly rejected as the staff had become bonded
to Clarabelle, so she was kept at the SPCA shelter as
a companion pet. She is a delightful little animal with
remarkable intelligence.

Several months ago, a small tumor was noticed on
Clarabelle’s abdomen. The tumor continued to grow

 

and it was apparent that she would have to be euthan-
ized or the tumnor would have to be surgically re-
moved.

Clarabelle’ s SPCA friends immediately ruled out
euthanasia as one employee remarked, “I realize
many people will say that Clarabelle is only a rat, but
to us she’s very special and if necessary we can all go
together and pay for her surgery.”

Thanks to the compassion and professiOnal exper-
tise of Dr. Marc T. Hays and staff of BelIaire Boule-
vard Animal Clinic, Clarabelle survived the surgery
and is doing well. Although, she wears an Elizabe-
than collar to protect the surgical area, Clarabelle
continues to be a never-ending source of pleasure.

The life span of a rat is about two to three years
with a 3-year-old rat being comparable to a 100-year—
old person. Therefore, we can assume that Clara-
belle’s remaining time as a companion pet is limited.
Regardless, this little animal has proven to me and
others that love can be manifested in many strange
ways.

Clarabelle has taught us many things about pet
rats. They are easy to care for with simple require-
ments of clean bedding and fresh food and water.
They are inexpensive to keep and practically odorless
provided the cage is kept clean. Rats groom them-
selves many times during the day and soil only cer-
tain areas of their cage.

They relish table scraps from cornbread to steak.
Their diet should be based onn a protein source and a
fruit and vegetable mix. Good protein sources are dry
kibble dog food and various grains. Finely chopped
fruits and vegetables such as bananas, apples, straw-
berries, lettuce, tomatoes and grated carrots are ex-
cellent.

Clarabelle is, as many will say, only a rat; but she
has taught her friends how to further fulfil their ap-
pointed tasks in humility and trustfulness.

Animal shelter +
now openin JC'

Washington County Bureau

JOHNSON CITY — With this
week’s opening of the new ani-
mal shelter, Washington Coun-
ty residents for the first time
have access to a comprehensive
animal control program.

The joint city-county shelter,
on Market Street behind the
Boys Club, is double the size of
the old Austin Springs Road fa-
cility and will operate seven
days a week — noon-5 pm. Mon-
day through Friday and noon-4
pm. on weekends. In the morn-
ings, the staff will be cleaning
the shelter and feeding the ani-
mals.

An animal control officer also
will be available to respond to
complaints from county reSi-
dents and investigate cruelty
cases.

Because the new shelter is
centrally located in Johnson
City, shelter Director Jan Delin-
ger said it likely will be better

utilized by city and county resi-
dents. Already, animal adop-
tions have increased
“tremendously.”

“We had five dogs, two pup-
pies and a kitten adopted in one
day. Eight in one week was a
miracle in the old place,” Delin-
ger said.

Delinger said there will be
some changes in the policy for
animal adoptions. The adoption
fee, now $10, likely will be
raised to $35, with a $20 refund
if the ‘owner gets the animal
spayed or neutered.

County Executive George
Jaynes said the county’s share
of the $175,000 shelter was mon-
ey well spent.

“The animal problem is one
that is hard to overcome,” he
said. “But county residents
have not had any type of pro-
gram before. They do now, and
I think all the people through-
out Washington County will
benefit from it.”

Moe and Curlie, two

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - February 16, 1987

War Heats Up
On Mount Tom's
Ram ’ 0 i n

By Dale Champion

The cunning wild pigs of
Mount Tamalpais are still root-
ing with chaotic fervor in their
Marin County hog heaven, de-
spite the combat tactics of two-
footed adversaries.

The hairy porkers have ravag-
ed meadows, rare wildflowers,
streams and lakes, so hunters and
baited traps have been used to stem
their rampage through some of the
Bay Area’s most prized parklands.

More than 150 pigs, which are
succulent fare, have ended up at St.
Anthony Dining Room in San Fran-
cisco as supper for the homeless.

Even so, the pigs are still mak-_

ing trouble on a wide scale.

Federal and state park manag-
' ers worry that the swine will spread
farther afield, from Mount Tam into
the dense forests and brush of the
Point Reyes National Seashore to
the north, where some pig wallows
already have been detected.

Now the pigs‘ foes have crafted
a new line of attack.

They are going to build miles of
expensive fences, then have beat-
ers, dogs and marksmen drive the
critters to their doom.

Wire fences are planned for
three sectors, enclosing in all about
73,000 acres on Mount Tam’s slopes
and bottom fringes. The National
Park Service hopes to start this
week to stake out the first fence,
forming a seven-milelong 100p
around uplands at the northern end
of Bolinas Lagoon.

The three-foot-high barrier will
enclose 2,000 acres, bounded by
McKinnon Gulch on the south, the
Fairfax Road on the north and
Shoreline Highway, bordering Boli-
nas Lagoon, on the west.

Judd Howell, natural resources
specialist for the Golden Gate Na-
tional Recreation Area, on whose
land most of the pilot fence will be

erected, said the enclosure will cost
$13,000 a mile. Marin Conservation
Corps members have been lined up
to do the work.

Depending on the availability
of funds, other fencing is planned to
wrap around Muir Woods National
Monument and part of Mount Tam-
alpais State Park, Howell said.

Another phase in the planning
stage, contemplates extending fenc-

ing from the initial loop for more
than a dozen miles north along Boli-
nas Ridge to Point Reyes Station to
protect Point Reyes from pig inva-
sions from the south.

“This is the ultimate solution,”
said Judd Howell, 38, as he spurred
his Park Service Jeep up a steep fire
trail above Bolinas Lagoon, into the
heartland of the pig packs.

More than anyone, Howell has
recently been in the forefront of
the Mount Tam pig war, which
dates back to the early 1980s when
Marin Municipal Water District
rangers began hunting and trap-
ping the wily pests.

Although dozens of pigs were
killed, the pursuit seems to have
driven the marauders into federal
and state parklands and the Audu-
bon Canyon Ranch bird refuge on
Bolinas Lagoon.

Two years ago, Howell and his
Park Service cohorts entered the
fray, with more traps and hunting.
More than 100 pigs were bagged in
that campaign.

The hunting, done by two pro-
fessionals under contract, did not
come cheap.

It cost $38,000, Howell said, and
resulted in pnly six kills over an
18-week period around the edges of
the Audubon Canyon Ranch bird
refuge. Although the price was
high, it was worth it, Howell said.

Among the pigs shot by the
hunters, he noted, was a particular-
ly vicious boar.

“That pig had been hunted and
hunted,” Howell said. “His ears and
tail had been hit off by dogs, and
they paid a heavy price for their
attacks. We figure four dogs got
tangled in Chaparral chasing the pig
and ended up getting gored to
death. Those big boars, weighing up
to 300 or 400 pounds, have tusks two
inches long and razor sharp.”

Howell said that nobody knows
how many pigs are roaming the
meadows and ravines of Mount
Tam. “They’re nocturnal animals
and it’s hard to ever get a good
count on them. Maybe there are 50
to 70. The remaining pigs are the
smartest and meanest, so we have to
redouble our effort.”

Howell said that the pig packs
-- called sounders or drifts —- can
multiply at an astonishing rate be
cause the mischief-makers are such
prolific breeders.

“Sows can have two litters a

. year, with as many as seven piglets

per litter," Howell said. ”So the pop

 




Tam fencing plan is being pattern-
ed after similar pig control mea-
sures taken by the National Park
Service in Hawaii and underway at
Pinnacles National Monument in
San Benito County.

Marin is far from being alone in
having a wild pig plague. More than
half the counties of California are
fighting feral pigs.

The pigs, descendants of escap
ed domestic swine and wild boars
brought into California for game
hunting, have been ranging the
state’s oak woodlands for many de
cades, perhaps since the time of the
first Spanish settlers.

According to Howell and other
experts, their range and numbers
have expanded tremendously in re-
cent years, probably helped by
“gunny-sacking.” That is practice in
which people collect piglets in one
place and release them in new areas
in order to get hunting started.

Unfortunately, as so often hap-
pens with moving plants or animals
from their native sites to new turf,
the relocation can produce havoc,
as it has in Marin County. ‘

 

ulation can explode in a short time.”

On a recent day, Howell led an
inspection party across a grassy
slope, through a barbed wire fence
to a thicket of oak and Douglas fir
trees. The muddy ground was fresh-
ly furrowed by pigs.

“Looks like a Rototiller’s been
through here, doesn’t it?” Howell
said. “Pigs love acorns. But they’ll
eat almost anything. Bulbs, earth»
worms, nesting birds, salamanders.
They‘re kind of like walking gar-
bage cans. They can roll up mead-
ows just like professionals rolling
up a lawn."

The pigs’ feasting habits have
already harmed waterways, creat-
ing silt problems and threatening
salmon migrations.

Their destruction also endan-
gers native plant communities, in-
cluding the rare calypso orchid. In
the wastelands left behind by the
rummaging of the hogs, undesired
exotic plants like eucalyptus and
scotch broom are quick to take hold.

ecent discoveries in the south-
? western United States and the
' South Pacific have persuaded
.. a growing number of archeolo-
. gists that primitive people were much
more destructive to their habitat than
had been generally believed.

The current trend may finally put an end to
- what Dr. Jared M. Diamond describes as “the
. environmentalist myth” —- a bias toward “the
._: romanticized concept of the ‘noble savage’ ” pro-
; claimed by the 18th century philosopher Jean-
Jacques Rousseau.

» Diamond, a professor of physiology at the

University of California (Los Angeles) School of
Medicine, cited the destruction of plant species
.; on Easter Island and in the Chaco Canyon in
' northwestern New Mexico as glaring examples of
primitive human abuse of the land.

Strong support for Diamond’s revisionist
. point of view has come from Julio L. Betancourt,
; an archeologist at the University of Arizona, who

Just below this bucolic serenity, however,
there is an environmental donnybrook brewing,
one that is drawing national attention to the
2.1-million-acre Shasta-Trinity National Forest
that sprawls across all or part of six counties.

Fighting over the environment is nothing
new in these mountains, especially here in Trini-
ty County, where the US. Forest Service owns 70
percent of the land.

For years the scrappy residents have fought

‘for more wilderness areas, argued over logging

practices and outlawed aerial spraying of herbi-
c1des, much to the chagrin of the Forest Service

. and the timber industry.

This time the arguments focus on the north-
ern spotted owl, a seldom seen, fluffy—feathered
raptor that lives deep in the old-growth forests of

Northern California, Oregon and Washington.
Some experts say that continued logging in the
old-growth forests (defined as those at least 200
years old) threatens the owls and myriad other
creatures. '

These old-growth forests are dominated by
giant Douglas fir and hemlock and contain doz-
ens of other species of conifers and deciduous
trees and shrubs. This diversity creates a leafy,
multilayered forest canopy, providing shade and
shelter for hundreds of species.

. As in previous disputes, the battle lines are
drawn between loggers and mill operators on one
side and environmentalists on the other.

The Reagan administration has ordered na-
tional forests in Northern California to draw up
plans for opening more land for timber harvest-
ing. The Shasta-Trinity Forest is cutting 185 mil-
lion board feet of lumber a year; under the goals
called for by the administration, that volume will
be pushed up to 321 million board feet by the
year 2030, an increase of 73 percent.

0n the other hand, forest planners are pro-
posing to remove from production 1.8 million
acres of old-growth forests from Washington’s
Olympia Peninsula to the California north woods,
according to the Northwest Forest Council, an
industry group. The council contends that this
withdrawal will cost the taxpayers $9 billion in
lost timber sales and will result in the closing of

lumber mills and the loss of 4,800 jobs.

Federal timber sales in Trinity County annu-

ally top $20 million, and the Forest Service, as
. required by law, turns 25 percent of this money
j over to local schools and the county road depart-
ment in lieu of taxes.

In towns like Hayfork, the spotted owl has

become a symbol in the forest controversy, but
' people here are quick to pointout there is a lot

more at stake than just the birds’ survival.

“The spotted owl issue is only a metaphor for
all forest practices; the basic issue is whether or
not industry can continue to eliminate the natu-
ral order for a fast buck,” environmentalist Den-

nis Corp said.

Logger Jim Stillwell disagreed: “The damn
owls aren’t in any danger. Hell, they got wings,
but those damn Sierra Clubbers will say anything
to stop logging, and that’s my livelihood.”

Tom Walz, timber manager for Sierra Pacific
Industries’ Hayfork mill, is critical of the Forest

, Service’s spotted owl plan, which calls for setting

aside 72 protected “territories” for the birds,

 




SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER

each territory covering 1,000 acres.

Experts say the northern spotted owl is part
of an ecosystem dependent upon old-growth for-
ests. Up here, the owls prey on flying squirrels
that, in turn, feed on fungi that grows only on
ancient trees. Without the trees, the ecosystem’s
fragile web of life is broken, ecologists explain.

Ornithologists estimate that there may be
2,000 breeding pairs of spotted owls in the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California. No one
knows their number for sure.

Last spring Sierra Pacific was halfway
through logging off a 12-million-board-foot sate
when an owl nest was found. Rangers stopped
the logging. Caught without a supply of logs,
Walz said, “We came within one day of having to
close down the mill.” That would have put 168
people out of work, he said.

Down at Alice’s Restaurant, where “spotted
owl soup” is sometimes on the menu, the mood
was summed up by owner Alice Ackerly: .“We
ought to save the owl, sure . . . but the mill here is
vital. . . . This would be a ghost town without the
loggers.” Her owl soup, by the way, is nothing
more than chicken noodle, she said with a laugh.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - February 22, 1987

 

 

 

Our Pets From the

Animal Activists Could Volunteer to Take

As a physician I have never been able to
understand the mental functioning, if there
be any, of the minds of the animal rights ac-
tivists (formerly called anti-vivisectionists).

There were only 699 animals turned
over to the University of South Florida in
1986 for medical research.

Let us suppose that these people will be .

successful. Is there anyone out there who
really wants a surgeon to do his first opera-
tion on a human being?

Is there anyone out there who would

prefer that a doctor practice on something ,

other than a human being?
Mannequins and cadavers don’t bleed.

Whereas the anatomy of the animal does
differ from that of the human, the actual tis-
sues themselves are very similar, particu-
larly in their healing properties. We can
learn the exact location and appearance of
all anatomic structures from gross anatomy,
which is conducted on cadavers, but we can
only learn surgical technique from living
biological tissues.

As one who is continually learning new
surgical procedures, I have had many occa-
sions in which I have had to operate on ani-
mals.

I have always had at least one pet, cur-
rently I have two cats and one dog. But, if

given a choice between operating on an ani-
mal or a human being, the choice is obvious.

Some of the animal rights activists insist
that all medical progress be stopped. Others
say that we should use prisoners as our ex-
perimental animals.

I personally see nothing wrong with
making greater use of our prisoners for ob-
jects of medical research — this formerly
was quite common until the U.S. Supreme
Court stepped in. But, I really don’t think
that we should allow doctors in training to
perform potentially mutilative operations on
prisoners.

I have a realistic solution for all of these

 

Pound

Place of Pound Animals

animal rights activists. If they are coming to
a physician for medical treatment, they
should tell the doctor their views and re-
quest that no research that has ever been in-
volved with animals be used on them.

Well, we can still do psychotherapy and
we can use hot/cold compresses and poul-
tices, but we couldn’t use any antibiotics, as-
pirin, or narcotics.

Another solution: Since we all realize
that medical research is important, perhaps
these animal rights activists will allow them-
selves to be used. I see great problems with
forcing prisoners to be subjects of medical
experiments.

If the animal rights activists are really as

sincere in their beliefs as they say, I would
have no qualms at all about conducting any
experiment on an animal rights activist.
Of course, I would adhere to the same
rules that I have always followed: to do noth-
ing that would cause unnecessary pain or
suffering to the experimental animal and I
would want some protection from the law
when it became necessary to sacrifice the
experimental subject.
If those people are so sincere in their
concern for animal rights, let them voluné
teer to take the place of the animals.

Issue More Complicated Than Deciding . _

I’ve noticed a disturbing tendency on the
part of supporters of pound seizure to over-
simplify the issue.

Who can disagree when they say, “If it
was between my dog’s life or my child’s life,
I’d give my dog?” ' '

The issue is not that simple. We must not
blindly accept the generalized claims of re-
searchers that all of their research is neces-
sary or beneficial. How often do you hear
them get specific with their claims? Just
what are all these wonderful leaps in medi-

cal knowledge they’ve gained from inflicting
untold pain and suffering upon dogs and cats
-— former pets? How much of that research
has been duplicative in nature?

I’ve heard several supporters of pound
seizure argue that it’s OK to use animals
which have been discarded at animal con-
trol for research. These creatures are living,
breathing, feeling beings, not objects to be
used and thrown away.

Those who abandon animals on the
streets may be more inclined to take them

to the‘animal control facility — where they
at least stand a chance for adoption — if
they knew that the animal would not end up
in the hands of a researcher.

Whether or not one agrees with using
animals for research, it is simply not ethical
to use animals which have been abused,
abandoned, or neglected for research pur-
poses.

The real issue is whether or not it is right
to take an animal that has spent its entire
life being mistreated and abused by humans

Between Your Child or Your Dog

and inﬂict torture of a different kind on the
creature until it is finally dead. I feel that
the very least such animals deserve a peace-
ful, painless death.-

. There is a House bill pending which
would eliminate duplicative research using
animals and save untold suffering as well as
tax money. It would establish a central data
bank to which prospective research would

this type, if passed, can cut down on the
need for pound animals for research. our
U.S. representatives need to know of our
support.

I hope that the people in Hillsborough

every other county in the state has done .—
eliminate the archaic practice of pound sei-

Animal Control "

Shouldn't Be A

Supply House

It greatly disturbs me that the issue of
pound seizure is being strategically turned
by USF into a debate on the pros and cons of
animal research. The true issue at hand con-
cerns the role and function of our municipal
animal shelter.

I am angered by the fact that if pound
seizure is allowed in Hillsborough County,
our county animal control agency takes on
the role of a supply house for research ani-
mals. This seems totally incompatible with
the purpose of that agency. A department of
animal control is established in response to
a serious community problem: pet overpop-
ulation. Our response should not be to let the
local university feed on that problem.

The University of South Florida main-
tains that life-saving research would come
to a halt without the availability of pound
animals as research tools.

I read recently where the city of Los An-
geles over the past 10 years has reduced by
almost one-half the number of lost, stray
and abandoned pets in that area. This has
been done through tough enforcement of
local animal control laws, heavy emphasis

on pet sterilization, and a comprehensive .

humane education/public awareness pro-
gram. Public confidence and trust was re-
~ stored in the animal control agency, accord-
ing to its director, by doing away with the
practice of pound seizure in 1981. This
should tell us something.

I hope Hillsborough County will get on
with trying to solve the tragic pet overpopu-
lation problem in the community, rather
than trying, to find ways to take advantage of
that problem. I vote no for pound seizure.

UniNanted Animals

Benefit Mankind

For most of us, a well-loved pet has been
an integral part of family life. The happi-
ness, well-being and good treatment of these
pets is a responsibility that we all consider a
necessity.

However, this letter is about something
entirely different — the unwanted, unloved,
unowned, starving strays that are wandering
loose through the streets and alleys of
Tampa and elsewhere. They are picked up,
kept in the pound and after due time, if they
are unclaimed, are either put todeath or
are turned over to the medical school for
teaching or experimentation. Here they are
fed and kept under better, more sanitary
conditions than they have ever known.

As a medical student and later as a phy-
sician I have never seen any one of these
animals being mistreated or tortured. We

cannot forget the many benefits that have
resulted from the use of these strays;

As a few examples:

' The vaccines used in the immunization
of infants. I cannot help feeling that the use
of unwanted strays is immeasurably better
than using our own children as guinea pigs.

The benefits and dangers of new drugs
are better studied on these unwanted ani-
mals than on people.

Surgeons may perfect new types of sur-
gery such as open heart surgery, organ re-
placement, new surgery for help in control
of cancer, to name a few, all of which are in-
finitely better when tried and practiced on
these strays. All of these procedures are
done under anesthesia similar to that used
in human surgery.

Let us not deny these unwanted, unloved
strays the credit for their untold benefit to
all of us. Informed knowledge of the use of
animals in medicine and honest criticism
and control of mistreatment, if found,
makes much more sense than passing laws
to prevent, the use of this important tool.

Researchers Exempt
From Animal Cruelty

This is in response to Dr. Polson’s letter.
Who is he trying to fool? He hasn’t told us
the complete truth. The truth is that animal
researchers are explicitly exempt from ani-
mal cruelty ordinances.

The University of South Florida can
claim humane treatment but the fact re-
mains USF is protected regardless of its ac-
tions.

Animal cruelty investigators are denied
access to research centers. I believe USF
has many real truths to hide. If this Florida
statute were changed to not exempt re-
searchers, all researchers would be arrest-
ed. If the voters approve pound seizure,
Hillsborough County animal control will be-
come a clearing house for animal research.

More household pets than ever before
will go to research laboratories. USF, other
universities, pharmaceutical companies,
etc., will be able to purchase cheap research
animals and possibly sell them fora profit.
Research is actually a big business.

Death With Dignity

For Former Pets

The Tribune was right the first time
when it was against Hillsborough County
using pound seizure.

Apparently you changed your mind on
the need for using unclaimed pound animals
in laboratories because of the human life-
saving research that would be abandoned
without these few pitful former! pets.

9

Do you really believe the loss of 699 dogs
or cats to the University of South Florida
last year would cost any human lives? What
life-saving discoveries came from USF labs
last year that depended on live animal re-
search?

The fact is, pound animals are cheap,
sometimes even free to laboratories. Most of
those 699 animals were probably someone’s
former pet.

Fact is researchers must generate half
their salaries from research grants. Many
are duplicative studies, with no human ap-
plications, poorly prepared, poorly conduct-
ed, and serve no purpose other than to ob-
tain grant money.

Fact is, if the animals cost more, re-

.. searchers would purchase and use fewer.

Consider the Heimlich fiasco last year.

The researcher wanted 44 dogs initially,
then 22, when he could have used one be-
cause he intended to prove the maneuver
would not work, and, of course, it would not.
He wanted to test a dog, not a human.

Fact is, all states exempt researchers
from provisions in cruelty to animal stat-
utes. If these people were held responsible
for acts of cruelty or inhumaneness, many
of us may be supportive of the need for live
animal research.

Until then, live animal research gives li-
cense to mutilate, torture, or physically
abuse helpless creatures. Is this ethical and
acceptable? It’s not necessary to deny death
with dignity to pound animals. Not now and
not ever.

Referendum Used
Only to Save Face

The sole purpose oinllsborough County
animal control should be to provide a shel-
ter for the lost and abandoned animals of
the county.

The county commissioners have turned
the pound seizure issue into a community
debate to save their face. .

Stopping pound seizure will put a feather
in Hillsborough County’s hat. Research will
not cease if shelter animals are not avail-

able. Voters should say “no” to pound sei-
zure and take a giant step toward.

Americans Want

To Have It All

The American public wants it all. They
want the best medicine, the best surgery, the
best drugs. '

They want it quickly and they want it
with a guaranteed 100 percent safety, or
plenty of money back. They Want all these
things, and they want them to be miracu-
lously invented. The closest event in re-
corded history that resembles this situation
is God giving the Israelites manna.

All gains come at some expense. The
American scientific community is trying its
most diligent best to provide adequate re-
search without unnecessary pain and suffer-
ing to animals used in experimentation.

There is no substitute. A biologic test re- _

quires a biologic system.

The portrayal of an animal holocaust is
simply ridiculous. By reacting to an issue in
an emotional and irrational way, the Amer-
ican public is withholding its own goals.

Animal Control
Is More Humane?

Polio vaccine, optical implants, organ
transplants, antitoxins, disease controls, are
all possible because of animal research.

Research will continue, whether or not
medical researchers are denied pound ani-
mals. But if denied, more money will be
spent for commercially available animals,
and that expense will be passed on to the
man on the street.

For those concerned, more attention
might reasonably be paid to unclaimed
pound animals and those not made available
to researchers. For reasons of crowding and
expense, if not provided to researchers or
adopted, they are put to death anyway. Are
we to believe that pound personnel are
more concerned with humane treatment
than medical students and faculty?

I have long been a practicing physician
in Tampa and have new in-” ins» wed in

am However, my patients and I have bene-
fitted from the use of pound animals for re-
search. Many of the important medical
developments of the last several decades
have depended upon studies in animal

models. The impounded animals are almost
universally destroyed with no benefit to
themselves or to the community at large.
The use of these animals, for research, is
strictly governed by institutional research
committees as well as NIH guidelines. j _

The cost of raising animals in captivity
to be used in place of the impounded ani-
mals would seriously deter further research
at the University of South Florida and many
other medical colleges throughout the coun-

try.

There simply is no sense in destroying
animals with anesthetic without, at the same
time, using them in an anesthetized state for
research purposes. There is no substitute for

' animal research.

Using Pound Pets
Is Not Immoral

I am a first-year medical student at the
University of South Florida. Almost 10 years
ago, I aspired to the challenge of a career in
medicine with service to people as a priori-
ty. I never dreamed that one of my first con-
ﬂicts would be over the right to use animals
which would ultimately benefit the people I
sought to serve. .

Some suggest alternative means for re
search and training which is provided by
these animals. Some suggest that we look at
the change of precedent set by other coun-
ties on this issue. ‘ ‘

But it seems to me that for years the use
of animals in this capacity has been widely
acceptable, and only relatively recently
have sensitivities been so unbalanced as to
indicate a need for change. .

The use of animals has not been con-
strued as immoral in the past, and I have no
evidence that should indicate it as such now.

The Animals
Suffer No Pain

The foundation of medical science is

. based largely on careful research. Much of

this research involves microbiology and
study of cells, etc. However, a large part of
this research is related to physiology, pa-
thology, anatomy, and all of this involves a
considerable amount of research with the
use of animals. It is because of this research
that medical science has grown so greatly
and can perform such miracles today.

To stop the use of animals in researc
would be a massive folly. ”

Years ago I would go to the pound where
there were dogs to be destroyed. I took these
dogs to the hospital where I was practicing
and used their facilities to study certain
mechanisms of the circulation. These dogs
were carefully put to sleep during the ex-
perimentation and suffered no pain. As a re-

sult of this work. I acquired a great amount
of knowledge concerning the fundamental
way the blood flows in physiological ani-

mals, which is extremely important.

Doctors cannot do experimental re-
search of this type on human beings. Animal
research is absolutely essential for the pro-

gress of medicine.

ST

POUND SEIZURE

(THE RELEASE OF LOST AND ABANDONED PETS FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY

 

ANIMAL CONTROL TO THE USF MEDICAL CENTER FOR USE IN RESEARCH)

 

 

Before you vote, GET THE FACTS:

WHAT IS “POUND SEIZURE”?
In Hillsborough Coun , “pound seizure" refers to the release of lost and abandoned pets from the Hillsbor-

ough County Animal ontrol to the University of South Florida Medical Center for use in experimentation and
research.

IF WE END POUND SEIZURE, WON’T ALL ANIMAL RESEARCH STOP?
WON’T THAT PREVENT US FROM FINDING FUTURE CURES TO DISEASE?

Pound seizure is currently prohibited in eleven states, all of which continue to engage in major biomedical re-

search. Of the eleven states prohibiting pound seizure, four are among the top states using the largest number
of animals in research. - ‘

AREN’T THESE ANIMALS GOING TO DIE ANYWAY?
Researchers want animals that are healthy, docile, trusting and accustomed to human handling. These are the
very animals that one would want to adopt as a pet. In many instances, animals released for research were
never made available to the public for adoption. '

IF POUND ANIMALS ARE NOT AVAILABLE,
WON’T IT COST TAXPAYERS MORE TO SUPPORT RESEARCH?

In reality. taxpayers could end up paying more for animal control costs that continue to increase due to lack of
public trust and confidence in our local animal control agency. Many people won’t use shelters which sell
animals for research and they prefer to abandon animals with the mistaken idea that they’ll fare better on the

streets. This adds to the cost of controlling strays and makes our community’s pet overpopulation problem
worse.

ISN’T IT ONLY “ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS” THAT ARE AGAINST POUND SEIZURE?
This is far from the truth. The recent public hearing on the pound seizure issue brought forth local business
people, pet owners, professors, medical professionals and people from all walks of ife who don’t consider
themselves "animal rights activists." They are citizens motivated purely by a concern for the function and role
of their county-funded animal control shelter.

THE ISSUE OF POUND SEIZURE IS NOT ABOUT THE MERITS OR DEMERITS OF

ANIMALSRESEARCH. THE ISSUE CONCERNS THE SOURCE OF LABORATORY
ANIMAL . ’

THE HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY ANIMAL CONTROL SHOULD NOT BE A SUPPLY
HOUSE FOR RESEARCH ANIMALS.

WE ALL WANT TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES, BUT WE ALSO WANT OUR TAX MONIES TO
FUND AN EFFICIENT AND HUMANE ANIMAL CONTROL SHELTER.-

IT 5 POSSIBLE TO HAVE BOTH.

HOUSTON POST - February 21, 1987

Horses put up for. adoption

By MARY FLOOD
Post Reporter

 

NAVASOTA -—
stamping out
but inmates in a
Colorado prison
have put their
mark on the 50
wild horses the
government has
up for adoption
here today.

The Bureau of
Land Manage-
ment for years
has placed wild
horses up for
adoption after
. taking them from‘ ‘
‘ from herds in Ne-

It’s not quite like
license plates,

vada, Wyoming
and California. EA _ ..

But the horses War stones
to be adapted for $125 each at the Grimes
County Fairgrounds from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
today and Sunday are the first horses to
be halter-broken by Colorado inmates
and taken out of state for adaption.

Among the horses is an appaloosa that
was halter-broken by an inmate named
Roach, who decided to dub the spotted
pony “He Who Rides the Wolf.”

The prisoner and the appaloosa were
part of a new program at Colorado’s
Freemont Correctional Facility in Canon
City where inmates learn a trade and do

the government a favor at the same time.

Veterinarian Ron Zaidlicz and ex-ro-
deo rider Tony Bainbridge spend most of
their week teaching medium security

prisoners how to feed, break and ride

wild horses.

The program not only provides the
government with horses that are halter-
broken, but gives inmates self-esteem
and a skill they may eventually be able
to use in the outside world.

“When we started this last year the
prisoners called it ‘The Suicide Squad,’ ”
Zaidlicz said. “Now the attitude has
changed. It’s prestigous. The men have
war stories.”

On Friday, several prospective buyers
came by the Grimes County Fair
Grounds on Highway 90 to look over the
animals before the Saturday adoptions.

Deby Conner of Old Washington said
she’d love to adopt a mustang and just let
it have its own pasture since it can’t be in
the wild anymore.

“I’ve loved horses since I was 3 years
old when I stole one of the Shetland po-
nies on a carnival ride and rode off with
it,” she said.

Her only problem was that she started
to fall in love with a gray stud born in
1985. The trainers said that particular
horse is a troublemaker that incites mis-
chief.

Cattle rancher Joe Thomason of Cen-
terville, who has adopted burros from the
government, was looking for a few good
-mares Friday.

“I want to breed the mares with my
zebra and get a z-donkey,” Thomason
joked.” .

The government provides titles of own-
ership until the new owners have had the
horse a year. A small percentage of the
horses and burros are returned to the
government because the owners either
neglect the animals or are afraid of
them, a spokesman said.

Terry Adamek of Pasadena, who
adopted a 2—year-old stud in 1985, doesn’t
regret buying the horse even though the
animal hasn’t been broken. “I just like
having a young stud around,” he said.
“My wife is not too happy about it,
thoughﬂ’

tang named “Stormy” from a Memorial

Helper Cheryl Guy and Jim Wade of the Bureau of Land Management
look over wild horse that is up for adaption.

‘area family who found the adopted horse

too much to handle. “The owner was
really scared of the horse,” she said.

By decreasing the wild horse and bur-
ro populations, the government hopes to
ease soil erosion and save the food supply
of other animals.

Lee Keesling, spokesman for the Bu-
reau of Land Management, said some
wild horses were destroyed to control
population years ago. He said this meth-
od has been suggested again but he
doubts it will happen.

There are about 50,000 wild horses on
government land in the Western states,
but the government would like to keep
the population down to about 30,000,
Keesling said.

Greyhounds that are too slow
l run on the fast track are kicked

ieir luck literally runs out — un-
rss fate deals them into Aleithia
ower’s hand.

Life usually comes to a halt for
1e sleek, lanky racing dogs that
ren’t up to speed even though
lany are young and have run few
aces, says Bower, president of
LEGAP, Retired Greyhounds As
’ets, an organization run on a
hoestring budget from the living
oom of her southwest Houston
partment.

“If they can’t make money for
heir backers they are shot,
tarved or abandoned on some

.0 one picks them up. You see
hem all skinny and hungry, but
hat’s a fact of life for them,”
lower said.

“It’s only a business for a lot of
he breeders. They want dogs that
ran make money,” said Bower.

Bower sees more than money
n the dogs. . .

Bower and about 16 other RE-

:rossing the telephone _ books in
march of greyhound breeders in

“Most of our money goes on the

Francis Moffit, a Waco breed-
er, said greyhounds are consid-
ered prime candidates for retire-
ment when they cannot run the 30
to 45 mph needed to compete with
the mechanical rabbit in the 5/ 16-
mile track.

“We pull them off the track
when they can’t win races,” Mof-
fit said.

But in a brief 3% years of rac-
ing, a greyhound can make up to
$500,000 or even $1 million for its
owner.

“They make wonderful pets be- _.

cause they are well fed with vita-
mins and in top physical condi-
tion,” Moffit said.

She said there are “a few rot-
ten apples” among breeders who
mistreat or neglect dogs who
can’t make one of five grades in
the racing business.

“Thet’s why we belong to an
organization that takes care of
them,” Moffit said. “These dogs

- are so lovable.”

Ron Wiley of Tomball said his
family adopted an lS-month-old
greyhound because the dogs are
very gentle and “laid back” most
of the time.

"You’d expect them to be
hyper, but they’re not. All the
kids love him. They make the best
of pets,” Wiley said.

A racing greyhound registered
with the National Greyhound As-
sociation costs between $1,000 and
$2,000. A greyhound puppy regis-
tered with the American Kennel
Club costs about $750, Bower said.
A greyhound from REGAP
costs about $45.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - February 13, 1987

LETTERS:

Torture
In the Name.

Of Science

Medical researchers at the University
of South Florida would like us to believe
that their specialized knowledge, medical
expertise, scientific wisdom and altruistic
intentions uniquely qualify them to clar-
ify the issue of pound seiuzure for a naive
public. .

The medical community seeks to im-
press and intimidate county commision-
ers and the public by invoking scientific
rhetoric, mystification techniques and
scare tactics.

If USF’s medical researchers are as
clever and competent as their credentials
suggest, how is it that they so easily
choose the dead-end path of least resist-
ance in medical research?

The mindless replication of medical
experiments on healthy animals hardly
qualifies as legitimate research but sim-
ply as an exercise in routine torture regu-
larly performed in the name of science.

As long as society continues to sanc-
tion animal exploitation by medical sci-
ence, scientists will not take the initiative
to meet the challenge of medical re-
search through other means.

The humanitarian portrait USF re-
searchers displayed during the public
hearing — symbolized by a parade of
crisp white lab coats —— is blood soaked.
The smooth rhetoric and callous arro-
gance exhibited by proponents of pound
seizure present an imposing exterior
while the anguished cries of trustng ani-
mals trapped in laboratory interiors artic-
ulate the pain and futility of an unde-
served, unjustified death.

I urge the county commissioners and
voters to draw on their courage and trust
their common sense to resist blind defer-
ence to the quiet fanaticism of conven-
tional medical research methods prac-
ticed in USF research labs. Otherwise,
Tampa should abandon its “next great
city” aspiration and resign itself to the
fact that Hillsborough County will remain
Florida’s shame.

l55u'e‘ls Using
Pets for Research

I didn’t think that the pound seizure
issue was whether animal research was
necessary or not. Of course, it is.

I thought the issue was whether or not
to use pets for animal research.

Animals raised for lab use haven’t
ever learned to associate humans With
love and caring, only with food. But some-
one’s little kitty is an entirely different
story realize that USF may not under-
stand. Afer all, when has it chosen com-
passion over the bottom line? But those
who vote should care enough to help USF
learn that some things can’t be measured
in dollars and cents. .

GAILY NAGY
Tampa

Animal Research:
Almost Obsolete

Hillsborough County residents should

 

 

vote against pound seizure in the upcom-
ing referendum on March 3, mainly be-

cause animal laboratory experiments are

greatly outmoded.

Seven methods of testing - for medi- ‘

cal research — which render lab experi-
mentation more or less obsolete are: the
use of computers, tissue culture, unicellu-
lar organism, sea urchin eggs, water
mould, human diploid cells and films.

Tests conducted at the New York
Aquarium employing sea urchin eggs
would have informed the medical profes-
sion about the truth of thalidomide some
years ago; but which, tragically, animal
tests did not reveal.

Animal research is a billion dollar in-
dustry. Therefore, one shouldn’t expect
the thousands of people involved to vote
against the referendum since it is their
means of livelihood. .

Research Animals
Will 'Live' Forever

It’s interesting to me that the destruc-
tion of 22,667 animals arouses almost no
concern or debate, but using 699 of them
for medical research is viewed as inhu-
mane. The medical school does not need
to purchase animals from other states.
There is a huge surplus right here.

An animal used for well-conducted
medical research continues to “live” in-
definetely in the form of scientific papers
in medical libraries. Information gath-
ered from this research may be used by

' physicians; research scientists and veteri- -‘

narians for years to come. ‘
An animal that is euthanized Is no
good to anyone. It’s just dead.

Surplus Negates
Need to Breed

I am writing in support of the use of
pound animals in medical research. As a

second-year medical student at the Uni-

versity of South Florida, I have seen first

hand how the animals are treated.
There are no armed persons “seizing”

animals and nailing them to the cross (as
indicated by fliers recently placed under-
neath the doors of many laboratories at

USF). There is only compassion for their

humane treatment and deep appreciation
for the role they play in the advancement
of medical knowledge.

It is ridiculous to think that organ

transplantation would be possible had the
; techniques not first been applied to ani-
mals.

All of the drugs currently available

would never have made the crossover to
4 clinical trials in human patients had they
not first been tested in animal models.

Animal research is vital in countless
other areas of scientific research and

5 should continue.

In light of this, it makes no sense to

‘ breed animals specifically for research

purposes when thousands of unwanted
stray animals are already sacrificed an-
nually in Hillsborough County.

I urge the residents of this area to rise
above the emotionally-charged sensation-
alism used by the animal rights groups
and realize that the use of pound animals
in medical research makes sense —— ethi-
cally and economically.

Greene shelter to house Clinton strays “

By Betty Kubik
GREENE COUNTY BUREAU ‘

WILMINGTON --—- Beginning today,
unlicensed stray dogs picked up in Clin-
ton County will be taken to the Greene
County Animal Shelter in Xenia instead

of a privately operated shelter in]

Wilmington.

Clinton County commissioners Thurs-
day signed a six-month contract with
Greene County for animal-control ser-
vice, after canceling a contract with the
trouble-plagued Clinton County Animal
Protective Association.

The commissioners will pay Greene
County $1.200 per month to take unli-
censed dogs to the larger, modern Greene
County shelter in Xenia. The animals will
be given humane care and made available
for adoption. The contract also includes
euthanasia of unclaimed or unadoptable
dogs.

Clinton County acted after closing its

dog pound on Fife Avenue last week
when it completed the sale of a 31-acre
parcel of land on which the building is
located. The mostly vacant land was sold
to the Community Improvement Corp.
for $158,000 to allow expansion of the
adjacent Airborne Industrial Park.

The dog pound is across the road from
the CCAPA shelter, which is still open.

Under the new system, Clinton County
dog warden William Weber will take all
stray dogs to a vacant chicken barn be-
hind the Clinton County Home.

If the dog is licensed, Weber will try to
contact the owner. If unlicensed, it will
be picked by a Greene County animal
control officer who will make a daily trip
to Wilmington, commission President
David E. Bailey said.

The Greene County animal shelter at
641 Dayton-Xenia Road was built in
1980. It has 36 indoor~outdoor runs with
stainless steel cages, said Art Evans, di-
rector of animal control.

The Clinton commissioners had been
paying the CCAPA $1,000 a month to
shelter the dogs picked up by the dog
warden, including both licensed and unli-
censed dogs.

But they learned recently that the asso-
ciation had been stripped of "its articles of
incorporation in 1982 for failing to notify
the state of its continued operation. ‘

A suit filed against Weber and animal-
rights activists Paula Bruner and Christie
Wolfe is set for trial April 2 in Wilming-
ton Municipal Court.

CCAPA President Lee Huston filed
charges of criminal trespassing and petty
theft against the three after they re-
moved seven dogs from the CCAPA shel~
ter and took them to a veterinarian for
treatment last November.

A hearing will be held Feb. 27 on a
motion by Weber‘s attorney to dismiss
the case because the association had no
authority to Operate a shelter after its
incorporation status was removed.

Bad News, Bears

Califomia’s last black bears are being slaughtered by hunters who
kill them, skin them, remove the gall bladder and leave the rest behind. 0n the
black market, the galls are as precious as cocaine. That’s because
Koreans believe bear gall can cure anything.

BY MARC REISNER

T WAS THE wrong night to be hunting hunters. A fat

lemon moon was anchored right over our heads, bright

as a street lamp. In the distance the ridge walls of the

Trinity Alps rose clear as phosphorescent ocean swells.
You could have seen a polar bear walk across the ice ﬁeld in
the bowl under Thompson Peak, without even using the
starlight scope. John Dawson said it was probably light
enough for poachers to see the moon glinting off the chrome
windshield casing of his jeep, which we had tried to camou-
ﬂage behind a big pile of logging debris. “Don’t think these
f ——g houndsmen aren’t paranoid,” he said. “They see a
stick in the road and they think we left it there as a clue-
the old thread-in-the-door-jamb routine. They climb out the
window and up on the hood so as not to leave any man-tracks

it behind their rig just the way it was lying. If they see a
glint of chrome up on this ridge tonight, they’re gonna
know we’re staked out. Then they’re on the CB to each
other, and they’re out of here.”

jake Bushey and Herb Janney came in over the police
radio. They were miles away, across the north fork of the
Salmon River, God knows where. “Any sign of anything?”

“Nothing.” ,

“It’s about the same here,” said Janney’s voice. “We saw
some fresh tire tracks, but they turned around.”

“Well,” said Dawson, “as long as we’ve got any bears left
in the state, someone’s gonna be out shooting at them. They
could be working the Gasquest-Orleans Road tonight.”

“Maybe we should try to get over there before dawn.”

I groaned. That would mean about three hours of sleep.
But it was becoming clearer to me that game wardens never
get any sleep. '

“We ought to get somewhere before dawn. Let’s give it
half an hour and go back to camp.”

Dawson put the microphone back in its sleeve, above the
twelve-gauge shotgun in its locked gun cradle. “just the three
of us. See what I mean? There could be poachers working all
around us tonight, and we can’t catch them. You pick a little
piece of territory night by night and hit or miss.”

“Bad odds for the bears.”

“Any bear who thinks he’s going to live to a ripe old age in
Trinity County is fooling himself. Or he’s lucky. Damned
f —- g lucky.”

E CIVILIZED CALIFORNIA at such a mad, blind

pace that we don’t even have a decent historical

record of what we lost, of what natural splendor

we bargained away for huge desert cities and
factories in the ﬁeld and man-made rivers and a $480
billion economy. Biologists don’t know how many waterfowl
migrated down from Canada and Alaska when the Central
Valley was still a vast seasonal swamp; all we have are set-
tlers’ accounts of “millions upon millions” of them and
someone’s estimate that 500,000 wild ducks were sold in
San Francisco alone, legally, as late as 1910. (Now, of
course, you can’t sell any legally; 93 percent of the wetlands
and most of the waterfowl are gone.) A herd of antelope and
tule elk that may have numbered a million and a half was
out there with the hordes of ducks and geese, making the
valley every bit the rival of the Serengeti. Salmon came up
through the delta and crowded into tributaries of the Sacra-
mento and the San Joaquin rivers until the creeks couldn’t
hold any more, and still they came. Elk with six-foot racks
browsed and rutted in the Mendocino hills.

But no wild creature (and a wild creature is more than
just an animal; it is a talisman that symbolizes a wild place
as fully as a suspension bridge or great gothic skyscraper
symbolizes a city) left an imprint on early California like
the grizzly bear. Aside from an occasional supersize polar
bear it was the biggest bear in the world, a bear that found
itself in a gastronomical paradise an earth with a Mediter~
ranean climate that excused it from hibernation, so it just
ate and ate and grew and grew, gorging on valley forbs and
ripe salmon and acorns and manzanita berries and an occa-
sional elk or Spanish cow (which it could kill with one swat
of its huge clawed paw). Around San Francisco Bay and
along the Marin coast, where the bears were especially nuw
merous, they ate grounded whales. The California grizzly,
like the extinct Plains grizzly, was a valley bear, not a
mountain bear like the Yellowstone grizzly. But this meant
that it was at home in the same places its only enemy aimed
to settle and civilize, and from the moment john Fremont
attached its image to the Bear Flag Revolt, the bear on the
ﬂag was doomed. By the time the legislature made it our
ofﬁcial state animal, in 1953, the golden bear had been ex-
tinct for almost 30 years. (That painless legislative gesture
somehow symbolizes the prevalent attitude toward nature
in our state: we like it, but like our weather, prefer it tame.)

So if we want a living emblem of our lost wilds, we must
make do with the golden bear’s smaller and less intimidat-
ing cousin, the California black bear.

Aldo Leopold once wrote you can take a few acres of
northern forest and put a pair of grouse in them and, the
grouse will represent just a millionth of the biological. mat-
ter in those woods; remove the grouse, however, and the
woods go dead. I was thinking of Leopold’s quote one July

while making camp far up the Tuolumne River. There were
a couple of deer about the meadow where we’d pitched the
tent, and the usual nutcrackers and jays and ground squir-
rels, and the river had some trout lying in its deep, frigid
pools, and below us a virgin forest was washing up against
the spires of Cathedral Range, but there was something. . .
not there. I was thinking what this meadow needed was a
bear, when a bear came right'out of the woods. An electric
tension went across that meadow like the racing pause be-
tween a lightning bolt and the thunderclap. The bear stood
stock-still and upright (and though it was no grizzly bear, I
tell you it was big; it must have weighed 300 pounds), snuffed
the air, missed or dismissed our scent, then began laying into
the meadow in a manner that seemed at once crazed and
comical, digging for something edible it smelled through
several inches of wet earth. It was comical, and yet the size of
that bear, its manic, hunger-driven energy, its mere startling
presence, transformed that meadow like a UFO in a garnet
night. It went alive! It jumped! In fact, in that one moment I
sensed the whole planet change. A softer, brighter and more
mysterious light began to rain from the sky.

Actually, Yosemite and the whole Sierra Nevada are
pretty inhospitable country for "bears. The range is too
snowbound for too long. Its forests are a virtual monocul-
ture of conifers, which don’t yield much to eat, and down in
the foothills civilization has pretty much thrown the bears
out. Where they still prosper is up north, in the country be-
tween the redwoods and the upper Sacramento River, be-
tween the Oregon border and the middle reaches of the Eel.

At least two thirds of California’s remnant black bears are
found in six northern connties of the state. And it is here,
more than anywhere, the bears have come under virtual
siege. It is conceivable —not quite apparent yet, but conceiv-
able—the bears are headed for a drastic decline in numbers
and may be all but wiped out in not so many more years.

OU CAN BLAME the catastrophic reproductive suc-
cess of Homo sapiens, you can blame the Forest
Service, road building, dams, seasonal unemploy-
ment, hound dogs, weak sentences meted out to
poachers and simple boredom. But if you want to be blunt
about it, you can blame certain affluent members of the
Asian community here and abroad—especially Koreans.
In Korea and throughout much of the Orient, bears rep-
resent potency and long life, and the gall bladders of bears
are alleged to have a medicinal effect comparable to penicil-
lin. (The theory is that a bear eats anything yet rarely
becomes sick in the wild, and the gall bladder is the detoxi-
fying organ; Western medicine thinks it is pure bunk.)
Wealthy Asians in the Orient will pay astounding sums for
powdered bear gall, which is mixed into tea—as much as
$5,000 a pound. Such prices have made the value of a Cali-
fornia bear equal to several bulging bindles of cocaine.
That fact alone, together with an inﬂux of at least a hun-
dred thousand Koreans to our state in the past ﬁfteen years,
has been working a slow calamity on California’s bears.
What has made matters worse has been the construction of
thousands of miles of new logging roads on Forest Service
land, especially in the northern coastal region, where most
of the bears live. The roads have given hunters easy access
to wild, rough country, where a bear was once reasonably
safe. They can kill and skin the bear, remove the gall and
drive out with $1,000 cash value stuffed in the trunk. It is a
felony to Sell any bear parts within the state, but penalties
are usually ﬁnes less than the value of the bear, and only a
tiny fraction of the poachers are ever caught.
Unemployment and seasonal employment in the state’s
northern counties work hand in glove with Asian demand
as the main reasons so many bears are being poached. To
an unemployed logger with nothing to do, a dwindling

bank balance and a .30-.30, a bear is a
big, four-legged marijuana plant. What’s
more, if he kills one, he most likely
won’t go to jail as he might if he were
caught growing pot.

Actually, a hunter who simply stalks
through the woods after bears will rarely
get a shot at one unless he hangs
around garbage dumps or puts out bait
piles (which are illegal). But even a
smart, man-wise bear is no match for a
gang of motorized hunters with CBS
and pursuit hounds (which are legal
here, though they’re banned in other
states) whose keen noses make them
worth $3,000 apiece. It is these
hunters, or houn'dsmen—of whom there
are thousands in‘ California—who are
tearing a giant hole in the state’s popula-
tion of mature bears.

Don Koch, the bear biologist with
the Department of Fish and Game, es-
timates there are 12,000 to 15,000 blaCk
bears left in California. (The pri—
mordial habitat could have supported
perhaps 130,000 of them, so bears, like
wild ducks, geese and salmon, have fol-
lowed a standard regime of decline:
about 90 percent of the pre-Gold Rush
population has been done in.) There is
no limit on the number of bear tags
Fish and Game sells, though each

 

 

hunter is limited to one bear per year.
In recent years 700 to 900 “legal” bears
have been killed annually; the much
more signiﬁcant question is how many
are being poached. The biologists say
possibly as many as are legally killed,
but the game wardens, who believe
they are in a better position to gauge,
tend to consider that ﬁgure low. How
long a species that reproduces painfully
slowly can suffer 12 to 20 percent of its
numbers slaughtered each year is any-
one’s guess.

According to Koch, the number of
bears has been fairly stable for the past
few years. What has changed is their
average age and size. Although a bear
in the wild can live to be 30 years old,
the typical trapped bear is barely 4. A
big bear used to weigh 500 pounds;
today, 350-pound bears are rarely seen.

“From the standpoint of population
dynamics, average age is critical,” says
Koch. “In California female bears are
usually four and a half years old before
they come into estrus. They only bear
young every other year and usually
have just one or two cubs. If the aver-
age age inches down below reproduc-
tive onset, we could suddenly get a
pOpulation crash. It’s below there now
in some areas that get heavily hunted,
and there’s been no crash. But that
doesn’t mean it couldn’t happen.”

Thomas McNamee, author of The

 

Grizzly Bear, says it is easy to visualize a
bear population dropping to the point
of no return. It may have already hap-
pened to the grizzly in the Yellowstone
ecosystem, the species’ last redoubt out-
side Alaska. “Grizzly bears are abso-
lutely protected up there,” he says, “but
the population is stable at best and until
very recently was in decline. The few
depredation bears that are legally killed
and the few others that are poached just
about wipe out any population gain. If
bears are thinned out too much and con-
stantly hounded, the poor animals may
not even be able to ﬁnd each other to

:mate. They’re not at all like deer, which

almost always manage to rebound. They
are a species that can go right off the cliff.”

magnitude of the bear poach-

ing problem until 1981, when

the Department of Fish and
Game got an anonymous tip that a
“Mr. Pack” in Los Angeles was buying
bear galls from any hunter willing to
sell them. A Fish and Game warden in
LA. ﬁnally ﬁgured out that Mr. Pack
was Robert Soon Park, a 37-year-old
Korean of uncertain occupation—his
letterhead shows a grizzly bear and the
seals of the Professional Hunters
Association in Alaska and the National

whose name was John Dawson, called
Park under the ruse that he was a
hunter with galls to sell. To Dawson’s
amazement, Park said he would buy a
hundred a year at $100 apiece.

So began a type of police operation
that has become increasingly vital to
wildlife preservation: an undercover
sting. It began on April 23, 1981, when
Dawson and a fellow agent, Rick
Wheeler, both posing as outlaw bear
hunters, requisitioned a road-killed bear
from a Fish and Game freezer and
showed it to Park in, of all places, a
parking lot in downtown L.A. Wheeler,
a former wildlife biologist who once
studied bears, incised the animal on the
spot and took out the gall. Convinced
after this display that Wheeler was, as
he put it, a “businessman” hunter, Park,
later told the agents where he got most
of his illicit bear parts from. “Redding. I
can drive up there and ask around the
houndsmen and buy 30, 40 galls.”

If that was true, Wheeler and Daw-
son decided, they’d better let Park ride
for now and move on the suppliers.
Posing as a transplanted Okie who lived
to hunt, Wheeler left his family for the
better part of seven months and moved
to Redding, learning about hounds and
Oklahoma and gradually worming his
way into the houndsmen’s conﬁdences.
He consorted and hunted and drank
with them, and though at one point he
came within a gnat’s eyelash of being ex-
posed, he was eventually encouraged to
run for president of the local hounds-
men’s club. According to a superior,
Wheeler made a brilliant undercover
agent because “he has combat nerves
and a face like a weasel.”

In November of 1981, in busts set up
undercover with the help of Paul Kim,
a Korean member of the Asian Task
Force, wildlife agents moved simulta-
neously on several outlaw Redding
houndsmen and on three major Ko-
rean buyers in L.A., including Park.
Raided ﬁles revealed that one of the
Koreans had, over the course of four
days, placed orders for 300 bear paws
(an expensive off-the-menu delicacy in
.Asian restaurants), fourteen bear galls
and ﬁfteen cougar galls. Park’s ﬁles
showed he had signed dozens of checks
and money orders made out to licensed
guides all over the West — one was even
inscribed “for bear gall.” One Califor-
nia guide alone was paid $2,350, which
could have represented more than
twenty illegally slaughtered bears. “Ev-
eryone knew they were killing the ele-
phants and rhinoceroses in Africa” was
Dawson’s comment on the whole affair.
“But here we had the same thing going
on in our midst, and we didn’t even
know about it. I thought, This is
unbelievable! This could do in our
bears. I guess that was part of the reason
I decided to move up north.”

 

RAW A HUNDRED-MILE circle

around Dawson’s house out-

side Yreka and you include

8,000 or 9,000 bears, tens of
thousands of deer, an unknown num-
ber of mountain lions and rare but re-
populating elk. There are still salmon
in the streams, and there’s lots of
smaller game. This is California’s out-
back, the last, best wildlife habitat we
have. It is also home to a lot of rough
people—loggers, survivalists, dyspeptic
Indians with little to do but ﬁsh and
drink and hunt, pot growers—and the
scene, every fall, of a crush of hunters
ﬂocking to the woods. In a territory
that is 95 percent forests and moun-
tains and streams and 5 percent settle-
ments and towns, Dawson and his two
neighboring game wardens, Bushey
and Janney, are the thin, ﬂexed, over-
extended arm of the law.

Many people regard game wardens
as a sissiﬁed, bastard form of cop, un-
aware it is one of the most dangerous
jobs in law enforcement. Janney, who
spent seven and a half years with the
California Highway Patrol in Holly-
wood and San jose chasing Hell’s
Angels and bank robbers besides the
usual Speeders and drunks, thinks
being a game warden represents more
hazardous duty. “With the CHP I had
backup in an instant,”janney told me.
“Here I can stumble on a dangerous
situation and I’m all alone. My nearest
backup is Jake or John, and they might
not be able to reach me in an hour if
they can even ﬁnd me. You can’t imag-
ine what it’s like to come across a rig
full of deer spotlighters or out-of-
season bear hunters at two in the morn-
ing. 'You’ve caught them right in a
violation, but there are four or ﬁve of
them, and they’ve all got thirty-ought-
sixes with telescopic sights. It’s you ver-
sus them, and you ask yourself, How
badly don’t these guys want to get
caught? You’re on a logging road 30
miles from nowhere, and if they want
to put your body where no one will
ever ﬁnd it, they can.”

Three years ago, Bushey ran into
just that kind of situation. On patrol
somewhere near Happy Camp, he ran
rightinto a pair of hunters who were
spotlighting deer. (“They just shine a
big powerful spotlight into the deer’s
face from the car, which paralyzes it,
and they blow it away. Illegal as hell,
and lots of people up here do it so they
don’t have to buy meat.”) As Bushey
stepped out of his truck to cite them, a
riﬂe barrel came out the driver’s window
and ﬁred two shots at nearly point-
blank range, but missed. Since then, he
always carries a loaded shotgun under
his front seat. janney carries one too,
along with an AR-.180 semiautomatic
riﬂe with a folding stock and a ﬁfteen-
round magazine in the back and a snub-

 

nosed undercover agent’s .38 concealed
on his person. All three wardens wear
bulletproof vests.

As for me, I was unarmed when I
spent a weekend on patrol with Dawson,
Janney and Bushey. Driving out of Scott
Valley for Forks of Salmon, however,
Dawson told me to open the glove com-
partment of his big Ford Bronco. There
was a loaded .45 inside. “Don’t use that
unless I’m dead or on the ground beg-
ging for mercy,” he said. “But in such a
case don’t hesitate to use it, either. We
could run into some tough characters.”

Dawson had transferred from L.A. to
Yreka by choice, claiming to be shell-
shocked by sprawl and also because he
loves to hunt. Within a few months,
though, his riﬂes were consigned to a
closet behind his pressing bench and
weights, gauzy with dust. Now, he says,
he inﬁnitely prefers hunting people, and
bear houndsmen are his special neme-
sis. “We threw a shoe at them with the
undercover operation, but there’s plenty
of outlaw bear hunting going on again.
The houndsmen have a lobby now called
California Houndsmen for Conserva-
tion, which is such a goddamned joke. If
we had one bear left in the state, a lot of
these jokers would be out there for the
privilege of hunting it down.” 'Dawson
happens to like bears. “It’s the man of
the woods,” he says. “It’s the most hu-
manlike animal, and it’s very intelligent
and really pretty harmless. I don’t know
how else to put it. What would Califor-
nia be like without any bears?”

Unless a warden is undercover—and
a number of them are, more or less
full-time—the only way? he can catch
poachers is to stake out or patrol. On
Friday night, after big steaks at a Forest
Service camp and lots of stories about
chases, standoffs with menacing poachers
and fringe beneﬁts like nude sun-
bathing girls, we decided to try a stake-
out on a high ridge above the Salmon
River canyon, where bears tend to
roam. City cops on stakeout are usu-
ally monitoring a storefront or, at
most, a whole block; we were looking
over perhaps twenty square miles. It
felt like I imagined Vietnam must have
felt, the more so because the wardens’
secret weapon was a starlight scope. A
spinoff of that war, the scope is a $6,000
toy, about the size of a pair of binocu-
lars, that turns the blackest night into a
greenish approximation of late after-
noon. I focused on a distant hillside, a
black hump with the naked eye; it be-
came old growth, clear-cuts and a clearly
discernible logging road. “Some hounds-
men will use a creeper light like we do,”
Janney said. “We couldn’t see it from
here. Through the scope, that little bit of
glow becomes a headlight.”

It was ﬁnally past midnight, and

'Dawson and Bushey, in particular,

seemed as restive as a pair of lions who’d

been waiting too long for a meal to wan-
der through. I used to hunt as a kid—it
was almost an obsession—and I began
to remember why. We were freezing,
tired and malcontent, but we all felt that
atavistic thrill of stalking, of pursuit.
It is a disaster of unreckoned propor-
tions that nearly all adventure has been
sapped out of modern lives; the stultify-
ing boredom must be taking its psycho-
pathic toll. But here we were, engaged in
a sanctioned war game of considerable
importance to life on earth, and I began
to understand why a lot of law enforce-
ment types cannot adjust to any other
job. The excitement kept me awake until
three, even though we hadn’t caught a
soul. We were up by ﬁve.

The next morning I rode patrol with
Bushey. Since it would be dark for
another hour and a half, and hounds-
men like to work the early mornings
when bears are moving around, we
were using a creeper light. Going
twenty miles per hour on a railroad-
gauge road cut into a thousand-foot
gorge with a ﬂashlight bulb for a head-
light can scare the wits out of you until
you get used to it. By the time the
eastern sky was faintly blue we were
somewhere atop the Six Rivers Na-
tional Forest. We had a stunning pano-
rama of the Marble Mountains and
Trinity Alps and of Mount Shasta. The

. remnants of a scattering storm hung

between the ranges like a cloud quilt.
The CB scanner, which had been rac-
ing pointlessly up until then, suddenly
snagged on a conversation. A faint
garbled voice came over channel
ﬁfteen: something about a couple of
dogs out and one in the truck.

If Bushey had a tail it would have
twitched wildly. “What is this?! We’ve got
houndsmen!” He immediately raised
janney and Dawson on the locked-out
police channel. “Did you hear that?”

“No,” said Dawson.

“Houndsmen.”

“\Ne’re coming your way.”

We ﬂew down the logging road toward
the cloud cover like an aircraft on a mad-
mouse approach. I asked Bushey how he
had any idea where the houndsmen
were. He said something about instinct
and the lay of the land precluding CB
reception from here, there and some-
where else, then launched into an ac-
count of how houndsmen hunt bears.
“The lazy outlaw types put out bait'piles
to draw them. I’ve seen them use 'any-
thing from dog food to a whole Cow.
They drive their rigs around where the
bait piles are, and if a bear has visited re-
cently the dogs grab his scent. Even
without a bait pile, if that bear has
crossed a road twelve hours earlier, the
best dogs can still whiff his trail. They
yowl and the houndsman stops and lets
them run. Bears don’t roam like wolves.
They kind of forage like a lawn mower,

so the bear’s probably fairly close to the
road. The hounds are homing in on him
like guided missiles, and he’s hearing
them and loping off fast, but he can’t
outrun hounds and most bears will
ultimately go up a tree. When the dogs
got him treed they change pitch and
that’s how the hunters know where to
move in. The bear’s cowering up there
on a limb with ten houndsmen and eight
dogs surrounding the tree and that’s the
last thing he sees. He’s usually just
wounded when he falls, and they have to
ﬁnish him off on the ground. Once I saw
a bear stuck through with arrows like a
pincushion still trying to run away. They
had to ﬁnish him with a .44.

“Some f —g sport,” Bushey said. “Do

.you know what that bear represents

biologically? Do you know how much
habitat and energy went into producing
a 400-pound bear? And then you think
of him being reduced to a little expen-
sive pile of powdered gall.”

We saw the hound rig in the road
before the houndsmen saw us, or so we
hoped. It was about a quarter of a mile
ahead, halfway around a sharp curve,
parked under a glade of imposing ma-
drona. ”Bushey went alert as a jaguar.
He grabbed the microphone to call Daw-
son and janney for backup. “We got
houndsmen right ahead of us,” he said.

“Jesus,” came Dawson’s voice. “We’ve
got some assholes right behind us, too.”

“Okay, let’s see what they’re up to,”
said Bushey, and we went off the line
like a dragster. As we came around the
curve, I heard a hound baying at us. I
was expecting to see a cluster of surly
houndsmen by a 4x4, but all I saw was
Dawson, standing next to a confused—
looking hound, howling like a werewolf.

“That f —g jerk-off,” Bushey mut-
tered. I began to laugh but stiﬂed it fast.

“Did I fool you?” Dawson gloated. I
was wondering how in hell Dawson and
Janney got ahead of us. The hound
came up to our pickup, snifﬁng and
wagging furiously. He seemed too
friendly for an animal that would have
loved to tear a wounded bear to bits.

“You know whose hound this is?”
Dawson said. “They nailed a sign to a
tree down the valley. P—’s.”

“No shit,” said Bushey.

“Who’s P—-—— ?”

“He’s the guy who told someone he
was going to dust Bushey and me over a
citation we gave him and then bought a
semiautomatic riﬂe a few days later. We
got a nice ofﬁcer-alert bulletin on him.”

“They’ve been in here running bears,”
said Bushey disconsolately. “They’ve
been and gone.”

“What should we do with the dog?”

“Let’s just leave him.”

We continued in tandem down the
mountain, the dog pumping after us.
Bear hounds are kind of squat, like a
big beagle, but they run surprisingly

 

fast. About three miles farther on,
Bushey and I peeled off on a spur road
to check a houndsman’s camp “that they
think we don’t know about.” The morn-
ing had warmed and we were in a beau-
tiful stand of madrona and oak, so we
stood around a bit and talked. As we
did, the hound came panting up to us.
“That son of a bitch smelled our tires,”
said Bushey. The hound looked implor-
ingly at us. “I guess you can’t blame the
damned dogs,” said Bushey, and swung
the hound up with his huge fullback’s
arms and dumped it in the pickup bed.
When we hit the paved road between
Somes Bar and Scott Valley we stopped
and let the hound out. Its owner would
probably be looking around here.
“Bear, bear!” yelled Bushey, pointing
down the ravine. The dog gurgled and
whined excitedly and went chasing
after an imaginary bear as we peeled
off. About ﬁve miles farther on we pulled
off onto a dirt road, at the end of which
was a pretty campground under some
virgin Douglas ﬁr. Janney and Dawson
were already there, standing around a
tree on which hung a huge piece of fat. A
few feet away, in some bushes, lay the
bloodied, skinned, headless carcass of a
150-pound bear. With its large rib cage
and surprisingly long legs, the carcass
looked almost human. The campsite was
a disaster of beer cans, liquor bottles and
discarded food. You could have been a
hunter and still felt a horrible gloom of
murder hanging over the place.
“\Nithout even looking at the carcass,”
Dawson said, “I betcha there’s no gall.”

E STRUCK OUT the entire

rest of the weekend. We’d

spent two and a half days

and driven perhaps 1,200
miles between the three vehicles. We’d
gotten only a few hours’ sleep, and we
had nothing to show for any of it. Bear
hunters had been working all around
us, and the gall-less bear suggested
they were doing it for proﬁt, employing
the quasi-military style and lethal arma-
mentaria of modern hunting to feed the
strange, superstitious, hungry maw of a
folk medicine reaching back 3,000
years. A few days later I asked Don
Koch, the bear biologist, whether a ban
on hounds, or perhaps even a ban on
hunting bears, might be necessary if
California’s de facto state animal isn’t to
follow its mythic predecessor to obliv-
ion. “In some counties where the bears
aren’t living to reproductive age,
maybe,” he said. “We still don’t know
enough about bears. It could be that the
four- and-ﬁve-year-old mother bears
don’t often raise their ﬁrst litters suc—
cessfully. There’s some evidence they
don’t, and then the bears might be in
more trouble than we think. We just
don’t know.”

(continued from page 112)

I asked the same question of Dawson
on the way back to Yreka. “I’m a game
warden, not a biologist” was his re-
sponse. “But I’ll tell you something:
sometimes the most frustrating thing for
me isn’t striking out all weekend like we
did here. It’s having Fish and Game and
the biologists say the resource is in good
shape while we’re ﬁnding cubs without
galls and catching one houndsman with
nineteen of the damn things.”

As we neared Dawson’s house, which
is snuggled into a narrowing arroyo a
few miles outside Yreka, we began to
see startling numbers of deer grazing
around us unperturbed. Two huge
bucks with grandiloquent ten-point
racks were munching grass not 200 feet
from the road. They were magniﬁcent,
almost as impressive as bull elk.

“Look at them,” Dawson said in dis-
belief. “How did they make it this long?”
He stopped the Bronco, got out and
wildly began throwing sticks at the deer.
“Get out of here, you idiots!” The bucks
ﬁnally trotted off at a relaxed pace,
antlers riding the air like ships’ masts.

Dawson said, “In some of the back-
country where we were today, those
bucks wouldn’t last half an hour if they
were this close to the road. Goddamn,
they’re dumb. Or else they must know

 

there’s a game warden living nearby.” -

Apartment managers, however, do not

went to 22 different apartment managers:
Goodbye, he was told, and close the door

Then DeVelvis called the Lewis Road

he had two Great Danes. “Wonderful,” ex-

“That’s just what I’m looking for.”

“What?” said DeVelvis. “I don’t think
you understand. I said two Great Danes.”’

two-bedroom apartment for $675 a month,
and pays $40 a month extra for a giant pet
enclosure for “the girls,” Duchess and She-
ba, now the complex’s official mascots.

this summer, be able to play on the new
hopscotch courts or the marble-shooting
rings, ride around in the bicycle area, play
tetherball, tinker in the vegetable and flow-
er gardens. When they get older they can
shoot baskets and wash their cars in areas
designated for those activities.

Lewis Road, however, is really about
pets. It came about partly as a result of
Mike French’s self-professed mid-life crisis,
when he turned from electronics engineer-
ing to realize his vision of creating “a pet
community.” It also arose out of a previous
experience he had owning an apartment
complex. He added a kennel onto his own
apartment and discovered that “I could
have rented that apartment ten times over.
The rental demand is very high among pet
owners.”

French went looking for a bigger com—
plex and found the Lewis Road Apart-
ments, which he says had been neglected
for twenty years and looked it. “But I saw
the beauty. I could picture the before and
after photographs.”

French’s “after photograph” is now a
white stucco, two-and-a half-acre complex,
surrounded by neatly trimmed lawns. It
features two-bedroom apartments, at-

 

tached to which are 45 chain-
link-fenced, gravel-lined kennels.
The complex, a little over a year
old, is 90—percent occupied, sur-
prisingly quiet, immaculately
clean and occupied by a very con-
tented clientele, most of whom
came to Lewis Road in a state of
some desperation.

There are now 25 pets, 60 chil-
dren and 120 tenants ranging
from ditchdiggers to engineers,
representing a variety of age
groups and ethnic backgrounds.
The four-legged residents are
spotted, striped and mottled, and
there’s even a one-eyed Siamese.
There are German shepherds,
Australian heelers, English
springer spaniels, Chinese Shar-
Peis, Lhasa apsos and Russian
borzois.

“I have a Noah complex,” ad-
mits French. “I’d like to eventual- .
ly get two of every kind of dog
known to man.” And fellow
apartment managers would like
to know who let French out of the
loony bin. To them, says French, “I’m do-
ing the no-no, the verboten. I’m making it
possible for families to live as they were
meant to: with children and pets. And I’m
making it possible for them to live comfort-
ably in a city. I’m sick of hearing about lit-
tle old ladies evicted because they own a
cat. Besides, people are a hundred times
harder to manage than pets.

“Still,” he admits, “I often feel like the
fool who has rushed in. But the support has
been amazing. If ‘attaboy’s were gold, I’d
be Fort Knox.”

Here, then, is how Mike French man-
ages his menagerie:

Tenants rent a six-by-ten-foot kennel for
$20 a month, or larger ones for $40. The
kennels include locks, sun / rain covers and a
disinfectant program run by the manage-
ment. Furthermore, free spray cannisters of
odor killer and tick-and-flea killer are avail-
able in the office, and they are meant to be
used. Hygiene is strictly enforced, and all
kennels inspected daily. Tenants who lapse
even a day in pooperoscooping are sent a
friendly note and, if they don’t respond
within a day, charged a $5 cleanup fee;
those who lapse three times in a row are
sent a friendly eviction notice. Only one ten-

Animal lovers Wage guerrilla War On chicken-fry shops

By the Chicago Tribune

TORONTO — It’s'been months
since animal-rights activists, in a
dramatic coup d’etat, swept into
power at the Toronto Humane So
i ciety and seized control from the
traditional dog-and-cat set, but the
battle for the hearts and minds of
the citizenry still rages.

Skirmishes have broken out ev-

erywhere — on farms, in the city’s ‘

; streets, outside fried chicken res-
[ taurants.
The most recent guerrilla attack
2. came Feb. 12 when vandals spray-
” painted “The Bucket Stops Here”
on the exterior wall of a downtown
Toronto Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurant.

Last month, an uptown outlet
suffered a direct hit: “Meat is
murder.” Store employees there

moved quickly to repair the dam-
age, neatly blottingou tthe word
“meat” so that puzzled passers-by
would see only “is murd
painted on the wall.

“Apparently they want us to stop
killing chickens,” observed an un-
impressed Angelo Mallinos, an as-
sistant manager at the restaurant.

In the weeks before these inci-
dents, protesters clad in skin-col-
ored tights and fig leaves urged
downtown shoppers to
rather than wear fur.e ”

Vicki Miller, then wpresident
of the Toronto Humea ane Society
and an ardent animal pro rotectionist,
also suggested to a gathering of
amused farmers that pigs have
“capable brains” and chickens
could live for 20 years if treated
more humanely.

er” spray~

“go naked '

It has all been part of a surge in
animal rights activity that has
startled this rather conservative
city filled with chicken-eating, fur-
wearing people.

From good- -natured street the-
ater to more serious sit-ins, hunger
strikes and sporadic vandalism
aimed at research labs that use an-

, imals for experiments, the animal-

rights movement has settled in for
an extended — and controversial
— stay.

At the center of the controversy ,

stands the embattled Toronto Huf
mane Society. .
It had, over the years, quietly at-

tracted bequests and donations to- ,

taling $12 million from the usual as-

so‘rtment of concerned citizens and

well-heeled benefactors. It operat-
ed a pound under contract to the

city, cared for stray and injured
animals and generally kept a low
profile.

But at a board meeting last Nov.
14, Miller, a founder of an animal-
rights group called Ark 11 that ad-
vocates civil disobedience and

non-violent “direct action” to pro- .

tect “animals and their individual

. liberties,” engineered a successful

takeover.

She produced 1,336 proxy votes
in favor of a resolution reducing
the size of the humane society’s
board of directors from 16 mem-
bers to 5 — effectively ousting the
old guard and replacing it with a
new generation of animal-rights
activists. _

The vote set off an extended le-
gal fight, currently being played
out in the courts, in which some

long-time humane society mem-‘
bers are challenging the legitimacy
of the new board.

Ontario provincial authorities,
meanwhile, at the urging of the
ousted directors, have launched an
audit of the society's books.

‘ What the old members fear is
that Miller, 34, who staged a 30-day
hunger strike in 1984 to protest ani-
mal research at the University of
Western Ontario, plans to take the
humane society down an activist
path and use its funds to support
radical animal-rights causes.

“They are a bunch of self-con-
fessed radicals. They are more in-
terested in fighting in the political
arena than in caring for the wel-
fare of animals in the Toronto ar-
ea,” said Adelaide Campbell, one
of the former directors.

 




Dissection oi Pregnant- Cot
For Seventh-Graders Protested

By Thomas C. Keane I

A South Bay animal protec«
tion group is loudly protesting a
seventh-grade teacher’s plans
to dissect the carcass of a preg-
nant cat for a life science class.

“We're concerned because the
children are so young,” said Kathy
Snow, speaking for the Humane So-
ciety of Santa Clara Valley. “Why
would you dissect a cat in the sev-
enth grade? College classes don’t
even dissect cats.” '

Snow said a parent from Miller
Junior High School in west San Jose
called her to complain about the
science lab lesson that explores the
circulatory and reproductive sys-
tems of animals and humans.

“This is a new age,” Snow said.
“There are new attitudes toward an-
imals and new attitudes towards us-
ing animals in science.”

Snow said she did not know of
any other local school district that
performs cat dissections.

Andrew Garrido, principal at
Miller, defended a dissection as an
effective and sensitive way to teach
students about the intricacies of hu-
man and animal bodies.

“This is one pregnant cat from
a biological supply company that’s
been injected with three different
color dyes for study,” said Garrido,
whose school is part of the Cuperti-
no Union School District “We’ve
been doing this for 27 years.”

The principal said that students
who find the lesson offensive may
leave the classroom without penal-
ty. The dissection is set for late
March or early April.

The teacher performs the inci-
sions to ensure that the project is
strictly controlled, Garrido said. An
earthworm and a frog also are dis-
sected as part of the class study.

“One of the reasons why the
teacher does the dissecting is so we
don’t have a chopped-up carcass,”
Garrido said. “We’re not just muti-
lating a cat.”

Dissections help teach children
the “sacredness of life” and how to
treat animals with care, he said.

Nellie Jenks, the parent upSet
by the prospect of a dissection of a

pregnant cat, said yesterday that -

she does not want to make trouble
for the school. “I just want them to
stepff she said.

,' Jenks, who has a main the
tcience class, said, “I’m not really a
gung-ho animal rights person, but I

think a lot 0f the public’would dis-
~ approve too.”
Jenks said she plans to draft 3
~ petition of protest for other parents
in an attempt to pressure the school
L into halting the practice.

Snow said the Humane Society,
which objects to using any animals
as “tools for learning," plans to send
a letter to the school and to officials
of the Cupertino Union School Dis-
trict. .

“Yes, Minnie is really coming out of her
shell,” said Christine Apuzzo, Minnie’s owner.

“Minnie is just like all other dogs,” remarked
Sari Mason, whose dog Moira is also in the group.
“I may be anthrOpomorphizing here, but dogs
need dog involvement.”

“They’re social animals,” added Lillian Krae-
mer, whose little dog Alexander was padding
along the sidewalk at 6:30 am. “People are fine,
but this group lets the dogs have social contact
with their own species.”

Minnie, a small white dog in a longolegged .

‘ sweater, lived in the suburbs for many years, it
? seems, and has had some difficulty adjusting to

city life. “Minnie was my father’s dog,” Apuzzo

" said. “He died. It was a traumatic experience for

the dog.”
The group walked down some steps, crossed a

‘ bridge over Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and oc-

cupied a strip of cement with some broken park
benches at the riverside just north of Slst Street.

The owners are all working women -- three-

single, two married, no children —- and they
talked about their dogs being unhappy that they

aren’t home all day.

 

 

Minnie often starts barking when Apuzzo
goes to work and doesn’t stop all day. The prob-
lem has been alleviated somewhat since she
joined the group. Also, Apuzzo bought Minnie a
brand new dog collar that administers an electric
shock every time the dog barks.

“I hired animal counselors,” Apuzzo said as
the women distributed coffee purchased at a
nearby deli. “One told me Minnie had to be
desensitized to doors and had me spending hours
walking around opening and closing doors in my
apartment. I felt crazy.

“Another one told me to tape inflated bal-
loons to the door to stop her scratching. And he
told me to have a party for the dog and sit on the
floor with her. I said: ‘But the dog sits on the
furniture.’ Another counselor told me I had to
train my voice to sound like a low growl when I
reprimanded her. I did that.”

The women said they met while walking
their dogs last spring and formed the group,
which now meets seven days a week, “to foster
happy, well-socialized dogs who can relate well to
other dogs,” according to Kraemer.

“ ’Xander is a very small dog,” Kraemer said

\

of Alexander, “but he has been in group Sim-e
puppyhood and is quite unneurotic. ’

“There is a social aspect to the group for as,
too,” she said. “I think we’ve worked through the
dogs in our relationships. We see each other for
parties and dinners now.”

' Luckily, the Oakland inspector was not bitten. But _“

f the incident is one of a growing number in which US. '

' authorities have uncovered attempts to smuggle rare
' or dangerous reptiles from Australia into the United
5 States through the mail.

A federal grand jury in San Francisco is investigat-
ing such smuggling. In the last year, several Bay Area

' reptile enthusiasts have been charged with illegal pos-

: them poisonous. - - .

; Bay Area pet shops report that sales of legal reptiles

jf and amphibians have grown ‘steadily in recent years.

And for animals not available legally, law enforce-

Since Australia will not take
back confiscated reptiles for fear
they carry disease, scores of rare
specimens have been distributed to
zoos across the country, said Ken
McCloud, a US. Fish and Wildlife
Service inspector.

Most reptiles are seized here dur-
ing the winter months, when it is
summer in Australia.

In November, the Customs Ser-
vice warned its Bay Area mail in-
spectors to be especially alert for
the Australian taipan, a green or
light brown snake up to 12 feet long
that has “has 20 times the amount

_ of venom necessary to kill a human
being.”
. Another notice before Christ-

been sighted in the mail room.

TAMPA TRIBUNE - February 26, 1987

LETTERS :

Safeguards -

Needed, Not
Prohibition

Many letters have been written re-
garding pound seizure. Each side has pre-
sented strong arguments, but what we
really need is a compromise. Use the ani-
mals, but regulate when and how.

An animal that could be used to im-
prove our human life is wasted when put
to death because no one wants it. And let’s
not delude ourselves with the euphemism
“put to sleep.” .

We have been exposed to accusations
of wrongdoing in this matter. If the ani-
mals are to be used, enforceable rules
need to be established. The length of time
the dogs or cats are held for their owners
to reclaim them should be stated (one
week?), then the length of time for adop-
tion (30 days if the facilities are available
for keeping them that long). Then when it
is a matter of death or humane research,

let the animals be used.

The methods and purposes of use
should be monitored to avoid unnecessary
duplication of experiments and avoid ex-
periments that would cause undue suffer-
ing. Perhaps an unbiased citizens commit-
tee could provide the monitoring.

I love my dog and I would not want to
think of her suffering if somehow she
ended up at the pound. But I am willing to
have my body used for research when I
am finished with it. If there is a real need
for animals, what alternative is there?

More Animals
Died Sooner

Recently there have been many arti-
cles and letters regarding pound seizure. I
recently moved to Tampa from Jackson-
‘ville. (Duval was the second to last county
in the state to allow pound seizure before
making it illegal.)

A very logical thing occurred in a few
weeks. The pound became overcrowded.

To compensate for this, the pound re-
duced the number of days from impound-
ment to death from six to four. Because
the pound no longer received a supple-
mentary income from the sale of con-
demned animals, it was forced to reduce
the amount ‘of food the living animals

were fed each day.
There was an even more tragic paral-
lel. It is legitimate to raise animals for

sale -— as pets or research animals. There
was a marked rise in the disappearance
of pets — some pure-bred — from their
fenced yards, including some which were
chained.

At any rate, it is a point to ponder.

SHELLEY GRANDELL

Don't Reduce Pets
To Clinical Rats

There is no question that we all bene-
fit from animal research. The referen-
dum on the March 3 ballot, however,
deals specifically with the use of pound
animals, namely dogs and cats, for re-
search in Hillsborough County. The six
commissioners who approved the public’s
right to vote on this issue should be com-
mended for their democratic decision.

Dogs and cats are the most ancient
animals bred by humans for the primary

purpose of providing love, companion-
ship, and protection. Have we now for-
saken their trust by callously allowing
them to be reduced to clinical specimens?

My neighbors and I care for homeless
cats that reside in our neighborhood. Al-
though these animals are not owned by
any particular individual, they are not
abandoned or unloved. Are they to be des-
tined for research or can we humanely
allow them to live or die with the dignity
that befits these domesticated animals? _

By definition, humane means that
which is marked by compassion, sympa-
thy, or consideration for others. How
then, does the donation of pound animals
for research qualify for this term? Surely
it means more than transportation to re-
search labs at the University of South
Florida in an air-conditioned truck.

I shudder to think of how my dog,
whom I found as a stray, would react to
the humane treatment administered to
his living flesh in the name of research.

Ethics Committee
Ensures Good Care

Most people understand that the ani-
mals used for teaching and research at
the University of South Florida medical
school are unwanted strays and represent
only a small fraction of the animals killed
at the pound each year.

Also, most people believe that animal
research is important but some have been
convinced by animal activists that the ani-
mals used at USF are treated inhumane-
ly. This is not true. Every teaching and re-

 

search protocol is reviewed in detail by
our animal ethics committee and must be
approved before any animals can be ob-
tained. This committee is composed of
nine members and three of those mem-

fbers are veterinarians. The committee

also includes a lay person from outside
ithe university.

i Members of animal rights groups have
been attending our committee meetings
for over a year. They have not found one

' instance of animal abuse at this institu-
tion. This is because the stray animals
that are brought to USF are treated better
than most of them have ever been treated
before. These animals are humanely
killed by the same methods used at ani-
mal control but before they die they serve

. a very important purpose.

Animal Activists

Should Go Without

I would like to ask these questions to
those who would like to ban all animal re-
search or who protest the use of pound

animals.
Are the people who protest the use of

animals in research willing to forgo all
medical treatment which has been de»
veloped by using research animals?

Can they guarantee that once pound
seizure has been stopped, the companies
responsible for supplying lab animals will
not be accessing pounds in other states to

. vA-WW-A—‘W WVH._—-

, obtain animals to sell at a higher price?

Are they aware that 22,000 animals

I are currently being euthanized in Hills-
. borough County each year, and that if the
medical center does not procure them, it
i will just add another 1,000 unwanted ani-

mals to the burn pile?

Once this issue is resolved, will they
take their fervent love of animals and de-
vote time and energy to finding ways for
the county to offer a low cost, effective
spay/neuter program, and a reasonable
non-punitive route to pet ownership?

Don't Let Pound
Pick Up Animals

There is a simple way to keep the uni-

(THE RELEASE OF LOST AND ABANDONED PETS FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY
ANIMAL CONTROL TO THE USE MEDICAL CENTER FOR USE IN RESEARCH)

 

 

 

 

Before you vote, GET THE FACTS:

. WHAT IS “POUND SEIZURE”?
In Hillsborough Coun , “pound seizure” refers to the release of lost and abandoned pets from the Hillsbor-
ough County Animal ontrol to the University of South Florida Medical Center for use in experimentation and
researc .

. IF WE END POUND SEIZURE, WON’T ALL ANIMAL RESEARCH STOP?
WON’ T THAT PREVENT US FROM FINDING FUTURE CURES TO DISEASE?

Pound seizure is currently prohibited in eleven states, all Of which continue to engage in major biomedical re-
search. Of the eleven states prohibiting pound seizure, four are among the top states using the largest number
of animals in research.

AREN’T THESE ANIMALS GOING TO DIE ANYWAY?
Researchers want animals that are healthy. docile trusting and accustomed to human handling. These are the
very animals that one wouldwant to adopt as a pet. In many instances, animals released for research were
never made available to the public for adoption.

IF POUND ANIMALS ARE NOT AVAILABLE, .
WON’T IT COST TAXPAYERS MORE TO SUPPORT RESEARCH?

In reality, taxpayers could end up paying more for animal control costs that continue to increase due to lack Of
public trust and confidence in our local animal control agency. Many people won’t use shelters which sell
animals for research and they prefer to abandon animals with the mistaken idea that they' II fare better on the
streets. This adds to the cost of controlling strays and makes our community” 5 pet overpopulation problem
worse.

ISN’T IT ONLY “ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS” THAT ARE AGAINST POUND SEIZURE?
This is far from the truth. The recent public hearing on the pound seizure issue brought forth local business
people, pet owners, professors, medical professionals and people from all walks of ife who don’t consider
themselves‘ animal rights activists.” They are citizens motivated purely by a concern for the function and role
of their county- -funded animal control shelter.

Lilah’s life was saved by dogs. But not
in the way you might think.

Lilah’s heart beats only because of
medical research. When she was four
weeks old, the Tampa child became '
the youngest recipient of a pacemaker
perfected on dogs. Without it, she
would be dead.

. Lilah owes her life to medical research ‘
— research that depends on the use of
unwanted, abandoned animals. These
animals that would otherwise be destroyed
in a pound -— a meaningless death — are
instead being used to save human lives
through medical research.

But unlike other newborns, she
also draws stares and smiles from a

Zoo officials took the baby girl
from its 14-year-old mother,

was not nursing her correctly.
Zookeepers did not want to take
chances with the new arrival, the
result of a three-year breeding

As the birth date drew near,zoo
employes, board members and
volunteers formed a round-the-clock
watch at the gorilla cage. in the
early morning of January 9, Malaika
delivered a 4-pound, 4—ounce

Though separated from her
parents, she is allowed to see and

Gentlemen:

Further to my letter to Joe Burton, State Senator, of
March 3 re the conditions under Which swine and hens
are living - if one can call it that - on most of the
farms of America, I am enclosing the complete copy of
The Humane Society's "Close-Up Report".

I have just re-read the conditions under which sows
are compelled to exist - I refuse to call it living -
and it is enough to make one throw up. How can any
decent, humaneminded individual, read the enclosed and
ever eat eggs, chicken or ham and.bacon again? I know
I will not until I find a store selling eggs and meat
products where the animals are raised in a healthy and
humane manner, Where they are allowed to roam around
the farm and not be constantly confined.

Something must be done to alleviate the suffering of
these animals who are providing these farms with their
livelihood and the entire country with food. They must
be forced to let these animals live in.a.nmnner which
gives them freedom to roam.

Please let me know that you intend to do something about
this.

Sincerely,

CMrS.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Demands Reforms Within Pork and Egg Industries

he Humane Society of the United

States (HSUS) is fed up with Amer-
ica’s pork and egg producers! After years
of grappling with pork and poultry in-
dustry leaders—imploring them to halt
their unconscionable exploitation of
animals—we’ve yet to see any signiﬁcant
steps taken to alleviate the suffering of
millions of hogs and hens. We can no
longer depend solely on dialogue. We
must now take direct action against both
the pork and egg industries and demand
that they adopt humane reforms. Our new
campaign depends on consumers like you
to rise up against these multi-billion-
dollar exploiters and spur industrywide
change!

For years, producers have tried to con-
ceal the deplorable conditions under
which the nation’s laying hens and breed-
ing sows are forced to live out their lives.
For a staggering 266 million hens—more
hens than there are men, women, and
children in this country—life is spent
behind the closed doors of “factory
farms” in cages so crowded that birds
barely have room to move. Millions of
sows used for breeding endure life inside
metal crates so small that they are pre-
vented from ever turning around. Many
sows are actually chained to the ﬂoor!

Over the past ten years, Dr. Michael
W. Fox, director of The HSUS’s Institute
for the Study of Animal Problems, has
worked to draw public attention to farm-
animal abuses. He has crisscrossed the
country to talk with farm associations,
animal scientists, veterinarians, and edu-
cators—anyone who will listen—urging
the implementation of humane alter-
natives to abominably cruel husbandry
methods. While we’ve made some head-

l 1. ‘ t...

.. _., .

way, dramatic change from within has
yet to materialize. ,
“The conditions on many of the na-
tion’s hog and hen operations are an out-
and-out disgrace!” says Dr. Fox.
“What’s worse, the number of these
animal factories has drastically increased
over the past twenty years. Unfortu-
nately, as long as consumers continue to
purchase these products at current rates,’ ’

Behind virtually every slice of bacon and every innocuous

looking egg lurks a long, hidden history of unbearable suffer-
ing. The HSUS is enlisting consumers' help to end the misery
for millions of hogs and hens.

he says, “the pork and egg industries will
continue to let millions of animals suffer
under these miserable conditions. It ’5 up
to consumers to demand that it stop
now!”

For this reason, The HSUS is now
enlisting your help. We want you to
pledge to give up bacon-and-egg
breakfasts until the pork and egg in-
dustries take appropriate actions toward

 




adopting more humane production
methods. Mail the enclosed postcards to
industry leaders to inform them that you
will not eat the “breakfast of cruelty”
and that you demand humane reforms.
After all, only when producers realize
that their callousness can affect their
proﬁts will they stop treating animals like
unfeeling, assembly-line machines!

Don'tBr'ngHometheBaoon!

So industrialized are today’s hog
operations that most of the pork con-
sumed in the United States comes from

vast superfarms—many owned by giant " dismal conﬁnes of the gestation crate to

endure the whole process all over again.

insurance, oil, and other conglom—
erates—that are capable of spewing out
up to half a million hogs a year. It’s in

the gloom of these warehouse-like .

buildings that an estimated two million
breeding sows, hogs used strictly for the
production of piglets, endure life in the
desolation of narrow, metal-barred gesta-
tion crates. There, locked away in their
tiny prisons, captives cannot walk or even

turn around. An estimated 100,000 of .

these helpless creatures are actually strap—
ped to the ﬂoor, held in place by a chain

so short they cannot even stretch their _

aching legs.

“As a veterinarian, I think this is an '

outrage!” says Dr. Fox. “Under natural
circumstances, these animals would be
outside exploring, foraging for food,
playing, and interacting socially. Yet, in
these factories, they’re banished to a two-
by-six-foot cell and deprived of all the
basic freedoms necessary for health and
psychological well-being! ’ ’

Unable to exercise or interact with
fellow animals, sows spend month after
endless month staring at the bars and feed
trough before them. With no way to
escape from the wretched prison, they
become frustrated and start biting at the
bars and swinging their heads in a
neurotic, repetitive fashion. Eventually,
a pitiful condition called “mourning
behavior” may set in; sows become
apathetic and appear to lose all interest
in everything—even food. Others become
obsessed with food and, if feed is not
restricted, become dangerously obese.
Even when such behaviors occur, nothing
is done to alleviate their suffering.

In fact, few farms even provide sows
with straw bedding to lie on! Instead,
these massive creatures are forced to live
on concrete or metal-slatted ﬂooring that,
for ease of cleanup, allows the sow’s
dung to fall through. For these hapless
animals, even standing up and lying
down on the slippery surfaces can prove
hazardous. In crate after crate, limbs are

torn ragged on sharp metal ﬁxtures, and

knees are scraped bare on rough concrete
floors. Chained sows develop deep
shoulder ulcers from the pressure of the
tethers. Time and again, open sores
become infected and, left untreated,
never heal. The aching joints and arthritis
that routinely accompany the sow’s im-
mobility compound this misery.

Immediately before bearing her litter,
the hog is driven -into another cage of
similar dimensions. There, the piglets are
born. In three short weeks, they’ll be
taken from their mother’s side. The

soonerfthey are weaned, the sooner the ,_

sow can‘be rebred and returned to the

It’s-Assault and Battery for
America’s Layers

In terms of sheer numbers, the sow’s
suffering doesn’t begin to compare to that
endured by laying hens. Of the nation’s
280 million hens, a staggering 95 percent
spend their lives in barren, cramped bat—
tery cages. With four to ﬁve birds shar-
ing a cage with ﬂoor space not much
larger—and sometimes smaller—than the
Close—Up Report you are now reading,
today’s layers endure the most restrictive
conditions of all farm animals.

Despite the hen’s natural urges to peck,
take dust baths, and lay eggs in seclusion.
today’s hen houses are built with cost-
cutting efﬁciency in mind. Crammed
together inside tiny wire cages, birds are
unable to stretch their wings, preen, or
even sit comfortably when laying their
eggs. Forced to spend their lives on a
sloping wire floor (so eggs conveniently

roll out), hens’ legs become deformed
and their feet ridden with blisters, foot
sores, and, ultimately, infections. “It’s
truly pitiful to see a hen that’s been
released from a battery cage and placed
on solid ground,” says Dr. Fox. “The
bird can be so painfully crippled that it
can’t even stand up. And, when it tries
to walk, it repeatedly falls over as if it
were in a drunken stupor.”

'In constant discomfort, caged birds
become aggressive; ﬁghting, feather-
pulling, and pecking erupt. A visit to any
modern hen house attests to these clashes.
In the gloomy darkness of the deep, win—
dowless shed, one can hardly avoid the
sight of mutilated bodies—those birds
with bare, bloodied spots peeked raw by
cagemates. These are the producers of
America’s “wholesome” eggs! In fact,
for virtually every egg consumed in the
United States, a hen will have endured
26 long hours under conditions like those
described.

Eventually, lack of exercise causes the
bones of caged birds to become thin and

fragile. For some layers, this weakness
spells broken wings and legs. Pent up in-
side crowded cages and unable to move
out of the way of other birds, thousands

of disabled hens suffer the most grisly of
deaths—they are trampled, cannibalized,

I or peeked to death by cagemates.

After a year’s worth of producing
eggs, survivors are either destroyed for
use in soup and pet food or “recycled”
to spend a second year in a crowded cage.
By cruelly depriving these creatures of
water, then starving them for a week to
ten days, farmers induce a molt, and a
new laying cycle begins. During this pro-

‘ cess, thousands die from starvation and
, acute stress. The fate of the emaciated
' survivors is not much brighter: it’s

another year in the battery cage.

United States Lags
Behmd EEC

Swiss legislators recently acknow—
ledged the brutality of the cage system
by outlawing its use nationwide by the
year 1991. The Netherlands has also
begun such a phaseout. The British
government recently denounced the cage.
In fact, there’s a movement underway to
ban the cage throughout the European
Economic Community (EEC). Likewise,
the use of tethers for the restraint of
breeding sows has been outlawed in both

Sweden and Switzerland. So progressive
is Sweden that roughly 85 percent of the
sows in that country spend their lives in
the comfort of straw-bedded pens.
Yet, here in the United States, it’s quite
a different story. Guidelines recently pro-

! posed by the United Egg Producers, the

US. egg-industry trade association,
called for cage space almost half of that
suggested in the standards adopted by
four European nations!

The HSUS has already been in-
strumental in persuading the United Egg
Producers to establish humane codes for
the handling and destruction of unwanted
male chicks at hatcheries. Similarly,
we’ve provided the pork industry with a
wide array of studies demonstrating the
efﬁciency of humane production systems
over intensive conﬁnement operations.
Despite a decade of dialogue, however,
this is one battle we cannot win alone.
Now it’s up to you—the consumer—to
drive our message home by informing in—
dustry leaders that you will no longer
subsidize this cruel exploitation. Only
with your help can we speak out for the
hundreds of millions of helpless hens and
hogs suffering behind the closed doors of
America’s factory farms.

 




 

 

It' s the Doggone Wackiest Custody Battle Ever.

 

 

Ex- Roommates Sue to See

Who Gets to Keep Pooch

Two ex-college roommates are locked in a
wacky court battle -— for custody of a Great

Dane!

The dog, named Duke, belonged to Jeff Peresta of Chica-
go. But Peresta’s college buddy Dan Gault says he found
Duke sick and neglected when he visited Peresta last year

-— so he took the dog home with
him to Virginia.

Peresta sued for Duke’s return. But a
Virginia judge ruled he’d neglected the dog
-—- and now Gault has custody while Pere-
sta’s lawyer tries for a rehearing

“I love Duke with all my heart, ” Pere-
sta said.

. “I would spend every cent I have to get
him back — but now I’m afraid I’ll never
see him again.”

Peresta bought Duke as a puppy in
1981 while a student at Michigan State Uni-
versity. Shortly afterward he and Gault be-
gan rooming together, and both men he-
came attached to the dog.

After they graduated in 1985, Peresta
moved to Chicago while Gault returned to
his hometown, McLean, Va.

Last April Gault visited Peresta —-— and
says he was shocked at Duke’s condition.

“I couldn’t believe my eyes, -- Duke
was so skinny he was almost a skeleton. I
fed him and he gobbled down the food like it
was the first meal he’d had in days. Jeff was
neglecting Duke.”

But Peresta denies that. “Duke always
had good food and plenty of water,” he said.

“And every day I took him out for a run in "

the park.

“When Dan told me he was taking
Duke on a ‘vacation’ to McLean, I thought
‘ nothing of it. But then he called and said he
wouldn’t give Duke back!" .

Peresta took the case to court. “But the
. judge ruled that I was an unsuitable owner
. and turned Duke over to the state,” he
said.

 

“The state gave Duke to the Animal;A

Protection Agency in Mc-
Lean — and they allowed
Gault to adopt my dog!”

Gault will keep Duke un-
less Peresta gets a rehearing
and the judge orders the dog
returned to him.

Gault’s claims that Duke
was ill are “ridiculous,”
Peresta said.

“I have vets that‘say he
was fine. I’ve spent $5,000
trying to get him back.
Would I spend that much to
get a dog back that I didn’t
want? Of course I cared for
him!”

Gault said he has spent
$3,000 himself to keep Duke.

Group" ‘

Sues UC Researchers

By Marc Sandalow

An animal rights organiza-
tion went to court yesterday,
seeking to improve conditions
for laboratory animals at the
University of California in
Berkeley.

In a civil action filed in Alame-
da County Superior Court, San
Francisco veterinarian Elliot Katz
and his organization In Defense of
Animals asked that all substandard
research be stopped.

Although the alleged mistreat-
ment is not documented, the law-

suit charges that researchers have .

engaged in a series of abuses in han-
dling 50,000 warm-blooded research
animals.

The suit also calls for the ap-
pointment of a special referee, who
would be allowed to make unsched-
uled. unannounced visits to the uni-
versity’s research laboratories.

Surrounded by graphic photo-
graphs of mutilated monkeys and
bloodied rabbits, Katz told report-
ers at the Alameda County court-
house in Oakland that university re-
searchers “don’t give a damn about
their animals.”

“It would cost them absolutely
nothing,” to provide decent care to
their subjects, Katz said, but they
fail to do so “because they’re lazy
and because they just don’t care."

University officials would not
comment on the lawsuit, but hotly
denied Katz’ allegations on quality

of animal care.

“We are involved in an effort
on the campus to develop an animal
care program that meets the high-
est standards in the country," said
Wallace Ravven, a university
spokesman.

He denied that the laboratories
operate under a closeddoor policy,

1 or that a new $45 million expansion

of a science building would also eat-

pand the role of animal research.

“They’re not closed, they’re no ex-

panding and they’re not unaccept.

able,” Ravven said, adding that the
animal rights group was attempting

to end all animal research.

. “They are using the media,” he
said. “They are showing pictures
which may or may not be at Berke-
ley, which may or may not be at
present,’

He said the campus animal re-
search labs are open to inspection
by the National Institutes of Health
and the Department of Agriculture,
which enforces the federal Animal
Welfare Act.

Kata, who was one of 71 animal
rights demonstrators arrested at
protests in Berkeley and at UCLA
last October, charged federal and
university officials with “collusion"
for trying to cover up the allegedly
atrocious conditions.

The university encourages ani-
mal research, he said, substandard
or not, to attract lucrative grants.

‘Dangerous Animal‘ Panel
Asked To Reﬁne Its Study

By STEVE TEASLEY

While praising the overall work
of a citizens committee on danger-
ous animal legislation, DeKalb’s
board of commissioners neverthe-
less asked the panel last week to
return to the drawing board and
reexamine a couple of specific
areas of commission concern.

DeKalb Chief Executive Ofﬁcer
Manuel Maloof requested the 11-
member group to reﬁne somewhat
its March 17 report on how the
county can best regulate owner-
ship of vicious - or dangerous -
animals. '

One particular issue that Com-
missioner John Evans wants re-
viewed is containment of animals.

DeKalb’s citizens committee pro-
posed in its report last week a law
that would require owners - when
leaving a dog or other dangerous
animal unattended - to make sure
that it is “within a house,»build_-
ing, fence, pen or other enclosure“
out of which it cannot climb, dig,
jump or otherwise escape on its
own volition...”

Mr. Evans said he believes the
proposed law should not leave any
“ﬂexibility” in that area. For ex-
ample, he said tops should be re-
quired on dog pens.

Not all board members agreed
with him.

Commissioner Jean Williams ac-
cused Mr. Evans of picking apart
the group’s legislation: “He is not
going to be happy with anything
elSe except banning pit bulls.”

It was an attack last November
by three pit bull terriers that
killed a south DeKalb 4-year-old
and sparked the commission’s push
‘for tougher vicious animal regula-
tions. . ,

“You’re talking about dogs who
kill folks,” said Mr. Evans last
week, responding to his critics.
“This is serious business.”

Still, argued Commissioner Bob
Morris, “This (adding further re-
strictions to the committee’s pro-
posed law) can get to the point that
p it becomes ridiculous.” .
Although he recognized that
some board members don’t support
more clearly deﬁned animal con-
tainment requirements, Mr. Ma-

loof nevertheless asked the citizens
committee to look at the issue.

In another area, Mr. Maloof re-
quested review of a public safety
department concern. Police offi-
cials told the board that the newly-
proposed regulations don’t have
provisions for animal owners who
are repeat offenders.

DEKALB’S COMMISSION con-
ducted public hearings on several
pieces of vicious animal legislation
last January.

And, a number of citizens
showed up to point out ﬂaws in all
the proposed ordinances.

So, the commission directed the
administration to appoint a citi-
zens committee to make recom-
mendations of its own.

On March 17 after two months
of meeting at least once a week,
the group’s chair, Dr. Carmen Bat-

‘Ztaglia, outlined .a proposal to the

commissioners in a Work session.

. Among other things, the com-
mittee changed the commission’s
language in the proposed law from
“vicious animal” to “dangerous
animal.” -

The report deﬁnes a dangerous
animal as “any animal which con-
stitutes a phySical threat to human
beings or other domestic animals
by virtue of a known propensity to
endanger life by an unprovoked
assault or bite so as to cause
serious bodily harm. An animal
trained, owned or harbored for the
purpose, primarily or in part of
animal ﬁghting. Exceptions: An
animal shall not be deemed dan-
gerous if: 1. it bites, attacks or
menaces (a) anyone assaulting the
owner or (b) a trespasser on the
property of the owner or (c) any
person or other animal who has
tormented or abused it or 2. it is
otherwise acting in defense of an
attack from a person or other ani-
mal upon the owner or other per-
son or 3. it is protecting or defend-
ing its young or other animal.”

Dr. Battaglia told the board that
the group’s proposed law “does not
allow any free bites,” meaning it’s
up to the owner to recognize that
he has a dangerous animal and
that he must live up to precaution-

. __.._._.._ -....-«. .

ary requirements within the law.

But, Commissioner Brince Man-
ning, for one, didn’t agree. He said
the deﬁnition of a dangerous ani-
mal might be a “weakness” in the
proposed law.

How can anyone say an animal
has a “known propensity” for vi-
ciousness unless it has previously
attacked someone? he asked.

Mr. Manning and Dr. Battalgia
also were at odds over whether or
not the committee’s proposed legis-
lation might have prevented the 4-
year-old’s death last November.

The committee chair said it
would have. But, Mr. Manning
claimed that it might not have
since the pit bulls escaped from a
house and attacked the youngster?
There had also been previous ani-
mal control citations against the
owner, ofﬁcials pointed out, claim-
ing that that fact didn’t prevent
thelater incident.

THE COMMITTEE’S legisla-
tion outlines the responsibilities of
all owners of any animals in De-
Kalb to keep their pets from harm
ing others - whether the animal is
unattended or under control of the
owner, either on his property or
off.

There are “additional” require-
ments of owners of dangerous ani-
mals. For example, except when
securely conﬁned in a vehicle, no
dangerous animal is allowed off its
owners property unless it is muz-
zled and is under collar and leash
control by its owner.

The proposed law permits
county ofﬁcials to seize and im-
pound dangerous animals when
violations have occurred. And, un-
less certain conditions are met,
animal control ofﬁcers are author-
ized to put the animal up for
adoption or euthanize it.

Owners Who violate the pro-
posed law can be ﬁned up to $500
and sentenced to up to 30 days in
jail.

Members of the committee are
Dr. Battaglia, Ernestine Bonhart,
Dr. Cheryl Braswell, Mary Gat-
tone, Jane Hart, Subira Patricia
Mitchell, Diane Mooreﬁeld, Jenelle
Roberts, Arlene Scarbrough, Dr.
George Smith and Maria Zorka.

“And there is the high-fat aspect,” she says, refer-
ring to the link between fat and cholesterol and heart
disease. _ .

Another concern is the effect of intensive animal
agriculture on werld food supplies.

“For each pound of meat seven pounds of grain
must be consumed,” she says. “American agribusiness
has extended itself into third world countries. . . and
that ties up a whole lot of agricultural resources. .

“It cleans off the grassland which holds the soil
together, and the soil is eroded. .

“There are so many resources used to raise ani-
mals. If these energies would be put into raising grain
and vegetables. sovmany more people could live." .

- But concern about animal cruelty is paramount, .

. Lettis says. '

“Killing is unnecessary and cruel. I’m not naive
enough to say I wouldn't kill to survive. but throwing a
lobster into a pot is cruel.” '

Even using milk and eggs from animals is unac-
ceptable, she says, if the cows and chickensare mis-

While the budget for the Meatout makes it no
match for the commercial clout of Shepherd and Jim
Garner. the sponsors are planning activities to call '
attention to the Meatout.

n the local level the Pe0ple/ Animals Net- "

work have enlisted the aid of an array of area

restaurants which will feature at least one :
vegetarian dish on Friday, some at discounts. Partici- ~

‘ pating restaurants include Allie’s, Anticoli’s, Casa ‘;

India, the Courtyard, 5th Avenue.

Some chefs are having fun creating special dishes
for the Meatout. At the King Cole, chef Phil Ashbrook
will offer a soup of fresh wild mushrooms, baby

corn, carrots and snow peas, in a vegetable stock. For

an entree he’s making a wild-and-brown-rice tim~
bale, served with root vegetables glazed with sesame
oil, and a bibb lettuce salad. As an alternative, he .

will be adding exotic fruits to his fresh-fruitplate.

“I’m doing everything with olive oil, no animal
fats or butter,” Ashbrook says. Plates will be garnished
with fresh flowers. For dessert, he suggests one of
his fresh-fruit sorbets. ;

At the Courtyard, Chef George Sideris, a vegetari-

' an himself , will be making setain, which some people

call “wheat meat.” Made from a flour base kneaded
under water, setain is poached in a mixture of tamari,’
ginger, garlic and kombu, (a sea vegetable). Some-‘
times it is finished in a dish such asa stir fry.

“It’s chewy,” the chef said, unlike tofu, which is
soft, or tempeh, which has a hard texture.

“Cut it real fine,” Sideris says, and “if you don’t
look at it too close it looks like badly cooked Chinese
pork"! . ‘ .

For those eating at home here’s a suggested meat-
less menu for the day from the Farm Animal Reform
Movement: ‘

BREAKFAST: fresh fruit or juice, hot oatmeal or
granola or waffles or pancakes, whole wheat toast or
bagel with peanut butter.

LUNCH: vegetable soup or split pea soup (without
ham); vegetarian pizza or tofuquiche; cole slaw or car-
rot-raisin salad.

DINNER: tossed salad or tabouli salad; vegetarian

cake or oatmeal raisin cookies or Tofutti.

He said, “She even got to the;

point where she began threatening
the males. And that is something
that never happens in the baboon
society because the males are
twme as big as the females.”

“She induced stress in everyone .
. she came in contact with, includ-
mg the staff,” Coelho said. “We ‘

finally had to put her in isolation "
g for a ' few months before we could

somewhat rehabilitate her.”

There were other reactions
among the test animals. Coelho
said extreme cases of diarrhea de-
ve10ped in some of those undergo-
ing the most stress. “Some ate
more and got fat,” he said. “Some
ate less and got skinny.”

“The ones who underwent the
biggest change in their lifestyle -
like some people in Houston —
were the ones who were stressed
the most,” Coelho said. “Those
who had been dominant in one

more of those deposits than you

usually get after two years.”

“Even an untrained eye can see
the difference,” Coelho said. “But
whether that relates to stress,
Type A behavior or something
else, we don’t know yet.”

Scientists will make several

“blind” analyses of the arteries,
.organs and tissues without know-
ing which came from what ba-
boon. Even the scientific method
of that study will be checked to
ensure that the findings are valid.

Then those results will be cross-
referenced with millions of bits of
computerized data on each ba-
boon’s personality, behavior,
ranking and whether it was in the
control or test groups.

That may take another 18
months to complete, Coelho said.
And with luck, the results will give
his group some insight into anoth-
‘er small aspect of heart disease.

“Heart disease is very com-
plex,” Coelho said. “It involves
hypertension, the build up of cho-
lesterol, obesity and many other
factors.”

‘OK, this is the way the situation
is,’ and went on. '

“I’ll bet their arteries won’t
show much disease.”

Generally, he said, the higher a
baboon’s ranking in his original
group, the higher he could work
his way up in the new group. But a
baboon who was dominant in his
first group never became domi-
nant in the next because others in
the group would join together
against him, Coelho said.

Unfortunately, although the ani-
mals underwent periodic physical
examinations during the study,
that could not provide all the nec-
essary information. So all of the
test animals were killed by injec-
tions in the past year.

Scientists are now analyzing the
animals’ hearts, arteries, adrenal
glands, kidneys, brains and other
tissue samples.

Coelho is excited about the indi-
cations. Using a red dye to show
up plaque and fatty streaks, the
scientists are finding a great dif-
ference in the arteries taken from
various baboons. Some are virtu-
ally clear while others show depos-
its and even thickening, resulting
in hardening of the arteries.

Monkey business may holdchUes to

By 8AM FLETCHER
Post Energy Writer

 

SAN ANTONIO -— Dr. Anthony M. Coelho Jr. '
is the T. Boone Pickens of the baboon world,
enmeshed in a five~year study of the inﬂuence
of stress on the big monkeys. ,

In his corporate raider role, Coelho goes into
an established baboon hierarchy, upsets it and
$3: measures the results in terms of heart

ase.

This all goes on at the Southwest Foundation
for Biomedical Research, established in the
1940sby Texas oilman Tom Slick.

U

The idea, Coelho said, was to create among
baboons the same sort of stress experienced by
many in Houston’s oilfield industry as a result
of takeovers and layoffs.

Other studies -- including some at the South-
west Foundation — have looked at the inﬂuence
of diet and “Type A” aggressive behavior on
heart disease, still the greatest killer in this
country. But Coelho’s study added stress to that
mixture.

“We believe that a combination of stress with

a high fat, high cholesterol, high sodium diet is .
more deadly than either stress or the wrong '

diet alone,” he said.

———..__

“So we created among baboons the kinds of
stress that you’ll find in any organization from
the Fortune 500 companies to your own family;
the kinds of stress that people are exposed to on '

a daily basis.”

The Southwest Foundation has the largest
colony of baboons outside of their native state
in the wilds of Africa.

The foundation has no relation to an anthro-
pological research center with 350 Japanese
snow monkeys at Dilley south of San Antonio
that is in danger of losing its government

. grants and donations.

Coelho said baboons were the
ideal animal for his study. For one
thing, their physical makeup is
close to that of humans. “in Afri-
ca, baboons eat the same foods
that the Africans eat,” he said.

Like humans, baboons live in
multiple-generation family units
that band with other families in
social groups called troops, work-
ing together to find food and shel-
ter. And there is a dominance hier-
archy among both males and
females within a tr00p “just like
the human corporate ladder,”
Coelho said.

’ Most important, he said, ba-
' boons develop heart disease just
like we do.

In order to duplicate the more
fragmented families in our mobile
modern society, Coelho put the ba-

;boons in five separate study
Igroups with six adult males and
“six adult females in each.
’ “That way they could have the
‘usual male-female bonding,” he
:said. “And there could be bonds
1. among the males and among the
* females.” .7 -. - 1

a---- .

I: '7 The groups were allowed two
:years to become firmly settled in
» their routines while their human
:observers determined who in each
"group was dominant, who was ag-
Zgressive and who was on the bot-
ftom of the baboon social ladder.

1’ j- “Dominance and aggressive-
:n'ess aren’t the same,” Coelho
" said. “Dominance is based on the
I; animal’s effectiveness in getting
:things done.

- “If an animal starts 400 fights a A

‘7 day and loses all of them, he’s ag-
gressive but he’s not dominant be-
-cause he keeps losing. But if one
‘gets into just two fights today and
wins those and two fights tomor—
rOw and wins those -— has few
fights but always wins — he’s the
dominant one in his group.

“The nice thing about being
boss,” Coelho said, “is that you
don’t have to get into very many
fights.”

At the same time, the baboons
were placed on a diet of specially
mixed biscuits made with lots of
butter, salt, lard and egg yolks —
“the equivalent of what we eat
when we’re eating bad.”

Then when everything was a ba-
boon paradise, Coelho stepped in
like a corporate raider to shake up

the establishment, rotating the top ‘
and bottom males and females '
among three experimental groups --
and leaving the other two control "

, groups stable.

" “We put the dominant male
from one group into a new group
where he came in as the bottom
man on the totem pole,” Coelho
said. “The one that was on the
bottom of his old group just made
a lateral transfer, but he had to
deal with new problems like being
ostracized.”
‘f . ,Whether from the top or bottom,
each baboon had the common
problem of not knowing how to
relate to a new group with its own
“good old boy” network and “of-

fice clique” already established.

 

 

,’ - D’- Anthony M. Coelho Jr. and two colleagues observe ba-l

 

our woes

“With the real possibility of physi- '
cal and psychological damage,”
Coelho said, “do you fight or do
you ﬂee?”

The transfers also upset the so-
cial order of each group, breaking
up some coalitions and forcing for-
mation of new ones. As with any
corporate shakeup, no one knew
for what the outcome would be.

“Baboons are better than hu-
mans because, if you leave them

‘ alone, they will eventually work it

out,” Coelho said. So to sustain the
stress, scientists continued chang-
ing the groups’ makeup each
month for two years.

And in the process, some of the
baboons went ape.

“There was one female who re-
acted to stress by beating up ev-
ery other female in the new
group,” Coelho said. “There was
nothing in her previous behavior

Dog guaranteed
to ﬁnd the bugs

in any building

By Tom Boone
or THE TIMES HERALD STAFF

Not everyone is going to believe this, Danny. And
Danny, being a beagle, isn’t in ,a position to plead his
case. But what Danny does for a living is hunt ter-
mites. He smells them out, and (here’s where you
lose some credibility, dog) hears them banging their
heads on the wall,

Termites are ugly white insects about lxt-inch long
that eat cellulose, which is in wood and in the back-
ing of many kinds of carpets, for example. The ﬁrst
time some people discover they are around is when
the ceiling caves in or the carpet peels up in sheets.

But Danny, according to the people he works with,
never misses. When he signals there are termites un-
der the slab foundation, there are termites under the
slab foundation. When he indicates there are no ter-
mites or carpenter ants or other wood-destroying in-
sects around, there’s a $1 million insurance policy
that backs up his judgment.

. All this information comes from people who own
and work for Dallas Pest & Termite Services, an
eight-year-old Dallas ﬁrm that hires Danny to work
for them. This week, Danny and several company
representatives are operating a booth at the Dallas
Home and Garden Show at Market Hall.

Rick Rogers, vice president of operations, said the
company leases Danny from the California trainer
who developed the highly secret training method for
turning ordinary beagles into termite dogs.

Robert Outman has trained security dogs, bomb-
snifﬁng dogs and drug-snifﬁng dogs, but he targeted
termites after having bought a house that was~ pur-
ported to be bug-free. It wasn’t.

There are 29 other termite dogs like Danny around
the country, but Danny is the only one in the Dallas
area.

Rogers won’t reveal exactly how much the compa-
ny has to pay for Danny’s services, but he said, “It’s
about the same as a good man’s salary. A good man.”

Rogers and Glenn Bjornaas, Danny’s handler, ex-
plained how Danny works.

First of all, Bjornaas said, Danny can smell wood-
eating bugs. Better than that, he ignores all other
insects, though he can smell them too. He is trained
only to react to termites and such. And they have to
be alive, Rogers said. He won’t pay attention to dead
ones.

Unless Danny is in his working uniform, and Bjor-
naas is in his, Danny is just an ordinary sort of play-
ful dog. But for at least 15 minutes before he goes
hunting, Bjornaas puts him in his own personal air-
line carrying crate.

“That lets him know he’s getting ready to go to
work,” Bjornaas said.

Bjornaas then dons a white smock, such as a den-
tist might wear, which is another signal to Danny that
he’s about to hit the trail. Then, ﬁnally, when Bjor-
naas puts a special collar on him, Danny is suddenly
all business.

Bjornaas walks along the walls of a house and taps
on the wood with a tool that resembles a long screw-

driver.

Rogers, an entomologist with a degree from Okla-
homa State University, explained the method: “There
are different kinds of termites in a colony. Most of
them are workers. But there are also soldiers, and
there’s one queen. The soldier termites have big
heads,'and it is their job to protect the workers.

“When they hear Glenn beating on the wall, they
bang their heads against the wood to warn the colony
that there is something threatening out there.”

Danny listens for the banging of thousands of tiny
heads, and for the chewing of thousands of teeny
teeth, for he can hear that too, Rogers said. When he
ﬁnds a concentration of termites, he starts making
digging and clawing motions.

Danny’s abilities are guaranteed 100 percent, Rog-
ers said. To make sure the dog is performing proper-
ly, company employees test him three to ﬁve times a
week, hiding live and dead termites in plastic lab
dishes, along with other insects, and sometimes some
hamburger meat to tempt him. Then they see what
he does.

He always ﬁnds the hidden termites and ignores
everything else, Bjornaas said, adding, “He’s fantas-
tic.”

To demonstrate, the men hid some live termites
and some dead ones in a 30-foot-square area near
their Market Hall booth. Danny found the right plas-
tic dish in about three minutes.

He also signaled there are termites under the Mar-
ket Hall concrete slab. Believe it.

A tough anti-fur campaign
launched Wednesday by an ag-

drawn howls of protest and purrs
of approval.

At the center of the “Fur Free

her job at a wholesale produce
market to care for her son.

Realizing that she would have
time on her hands, she turned to a
childhood interest of caring for in-
jured animals. She learned animal
care from her parents, who were
farmers.

Brown mainly nurses wild ani-
mals: foxes maimed by traps,
crows with broken wings, bald
groundhogs. The bald groundhog
was her favorite. It had been
bought by a family as a pet and de-
veloped a vitamin deficiency.

Brown has some informal train-
ing from zoo keepers, and has tak-
en classes in animal care. But
most of her learning has come
from practical experience, she
said.

Robin Duxbury, director of the

that “killing an animal simply for

The truck carrying this cow
was unloaded at.Ha1ton Stock-
yards in Kentucky the

morning of September 29th.
1903. After the other
animals were removed from the
truck, she was left behind
unable to move.‘ The stock-
yard workers then proceeded
to beat and kick her in the
face, ribs and back (note

her swollen and bleeding eye
in the photograph). they used
the customary electric prods
in her ear to try to get her
out of the truck. but she ‘ '
still did not move. The workers then tied a rope around her head. tied
.. the other end to a post in the ground and drove the truck away. She was
dragged along the floor of the truck and fell to the ground landing with
broken legs and peIVis. She remained in this state until 7.30 that evening.

She lay in the hot sun bellowing for the first three hours. Periodic
when she urinated or deficated. she used her front legs to drag herseallfly,
along the gravel roadway to a clean spot. She also tried to crawl to a
shaded area but could not move far enough. Altogether she managed to '
crawl 13-14 yards. The stockyard employees would not allow her any "
drinking water, the only water she received was given to her by Jessie
Pierce. JeSSIe.ialoca1 animal rights activist, had been contacted by
Eminie McNay who' had witnessed the incident. Jessie arrived at 12.00 noon
and after receiVing no co-operation from stockyard workers. called the
Kenton County Police. A policeman arrived. but after calling his
superiors,.was instructed to do nothing. he left at 1.00 pm. ” '

The stockyard operator, Lee Schneider informed Jessie at 1.00 pm.. that
he had obtained permission from the insurance company to kill the cow,
but would not do so until she left. Although doubtful that Schneider
would keep his word, Jessie did leave at 3.00 pm. She returned at

4.30 pm., by which time the stockyard was deserted and three dogs were
attacking the cow,which was .3 '

still alive. She nad " .

suffered a number of bites _L;""
and the drinking water had ‘ .
been removed. Jessie then ,
contacted the Kentucky ' a,
State Police. Four ofthem - ”3‘”
arrived at about 5.30 pm.

but was tolda veterinarian
should kill her. (A cruelty

by the State Police.) The"

stockyard veterinarian John Twehues would not euthanize the cow,

claiming in order to preserve the value of the meat, the cow could not

be destroyed until a butcher was present. The butcher eventually

arrived at 7.30 pm., and did shoot the cow - her body was purchased for
$307.50. (Usually, animals that are bruised. crippled or that are found
dead, are considered unfit for human consumption and used for pet food.)

When Schneider was questioned earlier in the day by a reporter from The
Kentucky Post, he stated "He didn't do a damned thing to it“, and_
referred to the attention given the cow by humane workers and police as
“bullcrap”. He laughed through the questioning saying he found nothing
wrong with the way the incident was handled.

The witnesses for the prosecution were not allowed an opportunity to
give their testimony at the-trial December 15th, 1983. Schneider
pleaded guilty and Judge William Schmaedecke fined him $100.00 and
placed him on two years probation. Which in effect is meaningless
unless a constant watch is kept on the stockyard.

The incident with the cow is not an isolated case, infact, it is so
common that animals in this condition are known in the meat industry as
“downers” or “downed“ animals. No effort is made by the meat industry

or the USDA to see that farm animals are treated more humanely. Obviously
they find these practices acceptable. The farming industry in general is
very secretive about how their animals are raised, transported and
slaughtered, they fear public Opinion. They have also proven that they
cannot/will not monitor their own industry. It is up to the public to
demand changes and for consumers to refuse to purchase their products.

The Animal Welfare Act, (enforced by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) does not protect domestic
farm animals. and has always been grossly under-funded to adequately
protect those species designated under its care. We need legislation
passed, with provisions for adequate funding, which will provide the
necessary protection for farm animals. *

ll.A.D.. Inc. - THE FARM ANIMAL

Al INTRODUCTION TO FACTORY FARMING

 

 

If they're not in the fields. where are all the farm animals?

Considering we consume 5 BILLION animals and fowl annually. have you
ever wondered where they are all raised? You can take a drive into
farming areas but you will see suspiciously few food animals. .Nith the
exception of cattle crowded in feedlots. all species are 'grown' in
factory farming units.

CRICKENS are crowded in cages so tightly they are unable to stretch.their
wings or move around the cage freely. They are debeaked and kept in semi-
darkness to reduce aggressiveness. Their feathers are rubbed away on the
cage walls and they develop breast blisters. They live for only one and

a half years when normally they would live between 15.and 20 years.

TURKEYS have been genetically manipulated to the point where their bodies
are so large their legs can no longer support their own weight. Turkey
hens are artificially inseminated because natural fertilization cannot
take place due to their overweight bodies and weak bone structure.

VEAL CALVES are raised in crates. barely larger than their own bodies.
They can neither turn around nor lie down comfortably. They are taken
away from their mothers a few days after birth and fed an unnatural milk
substitute diet low in iron to keep them anaemic and their flesh pale.

DAIRY 6095 Some people believe that cows naturally keep producing milk.
This of course is not so. They begin to produce milk when their calf is
born. The calf is removed from her so that the milk can be taken for
human consumption. The calf is then fed a milk replacement and not
allowed contact with his/her mother. Usually male calves from dairy
breeds are used for veal production. The cow will be artificially in-
seminated again and the cycle repeated a few times until she is physically
depleated and sent for slaughter. At today‘s intensive production rates

this takes only 4 - 5 years. A number of years ago a cow would still be
living up to 20 years of age.

PIGS are also raised in crates. They are taken from their mothers after
only a few days and their tails removed. their ears deeply notched and
their teeth clipped. The sow will again be artificially inseminated and.
, spend most of her life immobilized in a gestation crate. The crates
cause severe foot and leg injujries. To conserve food she gets no

exercise and is often fed only every third day. Sow deaths under these
conditions run as high as 10!.

fEEDLOT CATTLE are explosed to extremes of weather without shelter. They
are branded. castrated and dehorned without anaesthetic or veterinary
supervi510n. Their unnatural grain diet produces liver abscesses which
require the constant use of antibiotics.

f Mel Coleman raises?
2 cattle the old fashioned
Way. . .naturai

When old Jim Coleman settled in Saguache Coun~
ty, Colo, in 1869, raising cattle naturally was the only
way to do it '

. For his great grandson Mel Coleman, raising cat-
‘ tle naturally is still the only way to do it ,
,That means his cattle are .raised without antibiot- '

"’5‘: vice and hormones. They graze on grasslands that have
" - never been plowed, sprayed or fertilized. And the

T , grain that’s fed to the cattle is tested to be free of the
. ‘_ pesticides and herbicides used on most fields. .
y- ' All these controls mean that Mel Coleman’s beef
‘ is meat without the chemical residues ofmodern times.

_ y It is an achievement that won him recent honors
" from Americans for Safe Food, a coalition of more than

40 citizens groups pulled together by the Center for
., Science in the Public Interest.

At a time when consumers voice concern about
residues in meat, Coleman’s business is growing ~— con-
~~~~~ trary to the rest of the beef industry Among neigh-

’ “ bonng ranches in his county, 14 are in bankruptcy. He

 

 

 

was in the same spdt in 1979 when his meat was
first marketed, but now Coleman Natural Beef is in
such demand that 30 Other ranchers in Colorado and
Wyoming have joined his program.

The retail marketing of Coleman beef evolved
slowly. Coleman grew up as the fourth generation in a
ranching family. He and his wife Polly -— both de-
scendants of Old Jim Coleman :— also grew up with a

distaste for medicine. .

"‘Our families didn’t believe much in medicine,”
he says. “Our mothers said they’d rather pay the grocer

- than the doctor. We were the same with animals.”

Oh, he tried some of the modern postwar miracles ‘

such as penicillin, DDT and hormones. Once.

“I was just a young buck out of the Navy,” he
says remembering the time he decided to spray two,
strips of meadow close to the ranch house. '
“I didn’t notice it grew much better.” he said. So , '

‘ much for herbicides.

And then, one time in the late 40’s, when the fam- , '
ily bought another ranch and had more grass than cat-
tle, they contracted to raise some cattle brought in
from Texas. They had been implanted with DES, a
growth stimulant now banned. He didn’t like what
he saw.

“It changed their sexual behavior. It curled my
upper lip. That was the end of hormones for us.’

But hormones and steroids, implanted in cattle ‘
five to seven times during their lives, are commonplace

, in the rest of the beef industry. So are antibiotics,

which are routinely added to feed.
“They thought it would cut down on sniffles”
Coleman says. It also caused the cattle to gain weight

. _ faster, which became a cost-cutting attraction.

 

 

The massive doses have rendered the antibiotics
useless when they are needed, Coleman says. And he is

. concerned about those antibiotics getting into the

human chain.

Even the National Cattlemen’s Association, the in-
dustry’s trade association, has urged ranchers and feed
yards to stop using antibiotics in feed, yet, most feed
yards continue the practice. '

But Coleman is the last man to point the finger.

He refuses to “negative sell.” Committed to the beef in-
dustry and to the prosperity of fellow cattle ranch-

ers, he merely calls Coleman Natural Beef an
“alternative.”

he setting for Coleman’s ranch, high in the .
Rocky Mountains, along the Continental Divide,
is romantically pristine. The town of Sa-
guache --— pronounced So-watch -— is at 8, 000 feet, 200
miles from any city. The name Saguache' 15 an Indian
word meaning blue water. It is not only blue but pure.
“We’re at the head of the crik, ” Coleman says.

‘ “‘There’ 8 nobody above us.”

The cattle graze on native grass and run to 11,000
feet, along national forest land, until it’s time to finish
them with grain feeding. Nothing about that has
changed in 100 years. Until 1978, Coleman sold his
yearling calves, as most ranchers do, and never
knew what became of them. Usually, he says, cattle go
through seven or eight owners, through ranchers to
feed lots to packers.

“But I always wanted to control the destiny of
what I thought was a better product,” he says of his
mixed breed of Angus, Limousin and Gelbvieh cat-
tle, cross-bred for leanness.

 

 

 

 

 




CONTINUED FROM/23

Then his daughter-in-law, a young
mother, talked to him. Concerned about
ivhat her children were eating, she was

.trading at a health food store. But she
couldn’t find meat free of antibiotics
and hormones. '
.“You're raising natural beef,” she
said. “Why don’t you sell what you’ve

t,” she said. ,

—_'Z“A tingle went in my back when she
said that and it’s never gone away,”
Coleman says. “There it is again.”

f And so he began. In those first years,
he even raised the feed on a part'of his
land. The cattle, to the day they were
slaughtered, were raised without any
of the antibiotics and hormones that are
standard in the inditstry.

- “.It was 1979 and demand was slow in
his home state. He sold about 50 head of
cattle. His son suggested he visit Los
Angeles, where food trends start.

Lf‘l tore the yellow pages out of the
phone book — under H for health food
stores — and went knocking on doors.”
jIJ-‘l’e got his first customer, Mrs.
(ﬁbpch’s, which is now a chain of six
st‘prés.

.leradually he got a national foothold
in health food stores. And then four
years ago, Grand Union, a supermarket
Chain around metropolitan New York,
discovered Coleman at a health-food
trade show.

(;.‘.In those early years Coleman and his
wife personally handled demonstra-
tibns, handing out samples of his beef
in stores and at shows. They kept track
by counting the toothpicks —- '500
toothpicks to a box, two boxes a day
for 10 days at Grand Union. That’s

10,000 morsels, and a number of

converts.
’ His timing was right. Coleman Natu-
ral Beef is now. sold in 23 states, and
sales now amount to more than 20,000
head annually.
- .“We were the'first on the block,”
Coleman says, though some other com-
panies have jumped on the “natural”
bandwagon. It took Coleman a year
and a half to convince the US. Depart-
ment of Agriculture to create the “nat-
pral” classification for his beef.
. “But now they’ve reduced the quali-
fications,” he says. Some companies
that use the word natural only remove
the hormone implants and take the cat-
vltle off antibiotics in the final months.
Coleman likes to say his company
personally monitors the beef “from
conception to consumption,” though he
admits that has some literary license
since he isn’t in the kitchen with the
cook. But the controls exist through the
retail sale, where all the products are

labeled. And that is what-makes him .

unique.

‘ It is a two-and-a-half-year process,
.he says, from the time you put a hull
‘with the cow. That’s longer than aver-
:age, because no growth stimulators are

 

 

 

 

Jim Coleman

used. And that’s why Coleman’s beef

may cOst 25 percent more than other
beef, although not on all cuts.

The controls, he explains, range
from testing the water to independent
biweekly laboratory tests of the corn
and alfalfa grown for feed. Coleman
can’t grow the corn on his land, be-
cause of the short growing season and
limitations of the land. So he can’t
swear that the grain is raised organical-
ly, although contracts with farmers
stipulate that chemicals not be used 0n

' the land and crops. '

“But we test it for insecticide and
herbicide residues,” he says. “Some-
times it doesn't test out,” he says, and a
shipment is refused.

Veterinarians and operators of feed
lots where the cattle spend the last 100
days sign agreements to follow Cole-
man’s restrictions barring antibiotics
and hormones. The feed lots are in east-
ern Colorado, at lower elevations. “We
visit them frequently,” he says.

And there are controls to prevent
mixing Coleman beef with another
product. At the slaughterhouse door,
once the hide is off, the USDA inspector
stamps the carcass with the stamp
Coleman Natural Beef, in edible ink.

“T hey handle our beef first thing in
the morning; the plant is clean and
there’s no other beef around.” Car-
cusses that are cut up and boxed, are
labeled again. And, in the retail stores,
labels are placed on the individual cuts.

They say “No growth hormones, no
antibiotics, no preservatives, no feed
additives.” The latter means no tender-
izer. '

And how does this translate for
taste?

“A lot of people tell us it tastes bet-

Coleman Natural Beef, graded

choice, is available at Dorothy Lane
Market, beginning this week. It is la-
beled to distinguish it from regular
beef at the store. Prices range from
$5.99 a pound for T-b‘one steak ($1 _
more than beef raised by convention-

al methods) to $1.99 a pound for
ground beef (which is 30 cents more a
pound than regular ground chuck).
Coleman hot dogs, made without pre-
servatives, will be introduced later.

{Protesters miss the Detroit Zoofs point

THE DETROIT ZOO’S director, Steve
Graham, has brought a professionalism to

the zoo that it was sorely lacking. He has

tried by the management of animal exhib-
its to appeal to the intellect and under-
standing of the human species as well as to
, its fuzzy emotions. Mr. Graham is at the
moment, however, under siege because of
one professional management decision to
euthanatize five snow monkeys who have
been rejected by their community.

'Pressure from a small group of people,

who are evidently turned on by the cute-
ness of the monkeys has blown the issue
entirely out of proportion. The demonstra-
tion mounted by this group last Sunday
near the zoo in Royal Oak made‘ Mr.
Graham out to be an unfeeling animal
hater. The group wants Mr. Graham to
send the Creatures to the Texas Primate
Observatory, but the director thinks it is
better to destroy them than to place them
in an environment where adequate care
would not be assured. Moreover, Michi-
gan is more akin to the monkey’s native
Japanese home than Texas.

There are only two justifications for
zoos in a civilized society: One is that by
displaying the variety, beauty and wonder
of the animal kingdom, zoos educate
human beings on the value of preserving

_ such species in their natural habitats. The .

other is to preserve gene pools because

I human beings are destroying tens of thou-.

sands of acres of natural habitat every
~~ year through development of one kind or
_» another. Japan is doing that very thing to
the snow monkeys’ natural habitat.

. The euthanatizing of five monkeys
N which, fer reasons known only to their

kind, have been ostracized from their
community, would be merciful compared

to their dislocation to an inhospitable
environment. Keeping them in the zoo
would ultimately threaten the remainder
of the snow monkey community —— and
Detroit’s part in maintaining the species’
gene pool —- because of the prohibitive
cost of maintaining two separate commu-
nities.

Mr. Graham has been saying these
things, but he is not being heard over the
blare of the “Honk if you love monkeys?

doing. In him, Detroit has a solid, depend-

mals and people and the political realities

from our readers

 

The pomt 15 animals aren t for research

he editorial “Monkey Business: Protest-
ers miss the Detroit Zoo’s point” (Feb.
28) totally missed the point of the protest. As
one of the protesters, I can assure you that our
concern for the monkeys was not motivated
by their cuteness or by fuzzy emotions.
Rather, we objected to the proposal that the
monkeys be sent to biomedical research, as
most of the protest signs indicated.

If Detroit Zoo director Steve Graham were
truly concerned about the humane treatment
of these animals, he never would have consid-
ered such an option. Euthanasia is preferable
to torture in the laboratory. Our proposal to
send the monkeys to a sanctuary was intend-
ed as a positive alternative and should not
have been rejected outright based on an
authoritarian attitude.

NO! The protesters were not the ones
missing the point. It seems like Steve Graham
and the Free Press were the ones missing the

\point. We protesters are animal lovers who
— perhaps are more informed than the general
public about animal welfare laws and the
abuses animals suffer. We understand the
animals aren’t cute, fuzzy, little playthings.
We understand the full nature of animals.
They, like humans, feel emotions. They are
capable of feeling pain and loneliness, and
they can suffer extreme trauma from being
shifted from place to place.

Animals aren’t for research

YOUR EDITORIAL about the zoo protest-
ers missed the point of the protest. The people
were protesting the use of these animals for
research, not their euthanasia. Your editorial
makes it sadly apparent that much of the
emotional prejudice lies with those opposed
to the animal activists, being unwilling or
unable to listen.

I spoke with both Graham and Anne
Klosowksi, president of the Michigan Coali-
tion for Animals, while this protest was being
planned, and the only area of conflict was the
research issue -- which your article did not
even mention.

I agree that Graham is one of the most
intelligent and compassionate zoo directors

we’ve ever seen; yet, in his dedication to
maintaining population, he may tend to forget
the individuals. That is where the animal
activists come in — to speak for the individ-
uals. There merely exists, now, a difference
of opinion as to how humane or not this
sanctuary in Texas is, euthanasia being a
desired alternative to use in research.

With the numbers of animals killed in
needless and irrelevant research, I do have to
agree that the zoo cannot become another
supply house for the biomedical community.
That is what the protest was all about.

She’s the cats’ meow and ’lasthhope’
«for: hundreds of them

By Joyce Gemperlein

.. 22,,2:_. ast Smithfield, Pa.—Lesley
Sinclair is 67. She lives with
‘ Sally the pig and Gypsy the
' goat atop a hill in the
Endless Mountains of Bradford
County.

The pig, though, is not the thing.
Nor is the goat.

No, even though Sally is as big as
a riding lawn mower and the billy .
goat appears to speak when spoken
to, it is cats and dogs that deﬁne
Lesley Sinclair and the animal
rescue mission she is undertaking
here each day from the moment
her dozens of roosters beckon the
day. ‘

Sinclair has not one, not two,
not a dozen or a gross of cats and
dogs. She has not 200 or 300.

She has about 800, of which 150
cats and 10 dogs live with her in
her small house, even though she is
allergic to cats.

For the last 20 years, Sinclair has
run a shelter for the four-legged
homeless. The animals are not up
for adoption; they are hers. She '
refers people who want to adopt
animals to conventional animal
shelters where unadopted cats and
dogs are put to sleep.

Sinclair does not accept just any
animal. Most come from the
streets of Philadelphia and New 2
York City, where friends find them
roaming around homeless, without
food or love. Others are left to her
in the wills of people who worry

what will become of their pets after...

their deaths.
In a world of war and the threat

2 of it, cruelty and the ceaselessness w
of it, poverty and its pain, Sinclair ‘ '

has become used to people
questioning her priorities.

“1 might have done something
else,” Sinclair says. “I care about
the elderly, for example. But I am
these animals’ last great hope.

“Isn’t it wonderful?” Sinclair said
the other day as she stood at her
kitchen stove with breakfast toast
in her mouth and her menagerie
cavorting around her.

Her back was pressed against a
cage of cats. The cage rose nearly
to the ceiling, leaving a narrow
aisle to worm around to the
refrigerator and sink.

In the living room about 50 cats
stared down from bookcases,
chairs, tables and bureaus. Ten
dogs were leaping among the bric’
a—brac.

About 100 more cats were in
cages in the other half of the one-
story house. Outside, in a long,
bamlike structure, there were 400

or so cats in cages decorated with
color—coordinated blankets and
rugs. In another, similar structure
were 225 dogs, who were inclined
to bark and leap at the sides of
their chain-link cages in unison.

The animals living in the house
have a fenced-in back yard.
Swinging doors in the buildings.
allow animals there to run outSide
in big pens.

Sinclair spends thousands of
dollars a year to keep her animals
‘fed, healthy and comfortable.

She politely refused to say
exactly how much it costs. her to
save dogs and cats, but said the
money comes from an estate left to

her years ago by a friend who
made his money in the drug- .
manufacturing industry. She said
that she also had received money
from a dozen more estates of
animal lovers.

She receives sporadic donations
from mailing out plaintive
descriptions of her work.

Sinclair rarely leaves Sanctuary

31-acre compound where she has

Sinclair clariﬁed the message.
“When I go to town, I always
stop at the Burger King and buy
him a hamburger with cheese. He

loves it.”

Sinclair came from England to
New York City in 1948, she said,
and took courses in design and
owned two monkeys. Secretive
about her past, she said she had

been married but was not now.

With money given to her by the
drug—manufacturing executive who

has since died, she purchased her

ﬁrst property, in Toms River, N.J.,
in 1967, but left in 1982 after
encountering problems with the
neighbors and township laws.

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - March 18, 1987

SPCA Pact Threatened *

 

S.F. May Soon Become
Its Own Dog-Catcher

By 1. H. Doyle

San Francisco officials are
threatening to cancel a historic,
$1.4 million contract with the
Society for the Protection of
Animals and to put the city into
the dog-catching business.

Unless the SPCA is willing to

.1 provide its services without a bigger
’ chunk of San Francisco’s budget,

city officials say, an affiliation that
goes back more than 100 years will
end, and the Police Department will
supervise a. new animal control
agency.

The SPCA has request $1.57 mil-
lion for the year that begins July 1, a
12 percent increase over this year's
$1.4 million contract.

Contract talks between city of.
ficials and the humane society are
deadlocked, Richard Avanzino,
president of the San Francisco
SPCA, said yesterday.

Under the. current contract,
the SPCA rounds up stray animals
and tries to find their owners or
new owners. It also enforces animal
control ordinances, including the
pooper-scooper, leash and dog li-
cense laws.

If there is no new contract, the
city and the SPCA have agreed that
the humane society will provide
some services at current money lev-
els during a transition period, on a
month-to-month basis.

“We have been urging them to
accept the contract, but we can’t
meet their demands," said Rudy
Nothenberg, the city’s chief admin-
istrative officer, in a telephone in-
terview.

“There's always room for dis-
cussion, but we have been told that
these (SPCA) demands are non-
negotiable,” Nothenberg said.

“We have a good relationship
with the SPCA. We’re very satisfied
with what they do,” he said, “but

the city has only so much money to

spend, and the demands on the city
are enormous.”

Once the transition period be-
gins on July 1, Avanzino said, “we
will not be delivering comprehen-
sive care.” The SPCA expects to lay
off 20 of its 120 staff members, he
said. “Without these people, we
can’t deliver the services.”

“We cannot run our program

i for the number of dollars that are

on the table," Avanzino said. “We
will not sacrifice our standards of
care for the animals.”

This year, the city will impound
about 19,000 animals.

kingdom. Spike is an eight-year-
old crossbred Hereford-Jersey
steer who has a single horn grow-
ing out of the center of his head.

Fisher paid $2,000 for Spike, but
believes the animal is worth
more than $50,000 because of its
single long horn. The rancher has
big plans for his special animal,
which he hopes to ride in parades
in California and show at farm-
ers’ fairs throughout the country.

“I want to show Spike,” Fisher
remarked at his ranch in Yorba

Linda, Calif. “I’ve worked on
cattle ranches around the world
but I never saw such an unusual
animal. Frankly, I didn’t believe
such a steer ever existed, until a
friend of mine told me about old
Spike’s life on a remote ranch in
central California.

“Yeah, the old steer had been
living in luxury and away from
the public’s eye. I just had to take
off a couple of days and go up and
see him. I took color photos and
showed them to experienced cat-
tlemen, but they all refused to
believe the snapshots. All of them
claimed it was some kind of trick
photography.

“Rancher T. G. Magingal, who
owned Spike, never bothered to
promote him. Well, I just had to
own that animal. After a week of

haggling, we ﬁnally settled on a
price of $2,000. I got a bargain,
too.”

The ex-cowboy believes Spike’s
lineage goes back many years.
He thinkshe stems from a small
herd of milk cows which the own-
er sold off, and Fisher theorizes
that is when the cross-breeding
occurred.

“He has a black nose,” Fisher
adds. “Herefords never have
black noses. I believe he came out
of a Jersey line, but most Jersey
cows are small. Spike is very
large; he weighed almost a ton
when I purchased him a few
years ago. He has to go back Six
or seven generations.

“1 AM retired now,” Fisher
remarks. “When I saw old Spike,
I said we’ll enjoy our retirement
together. I want other people to
enjoy seeing such an unusual ani-
mal.” ‘

Spike’s horn is 25 inches long,
slightly longer than a normal-size
cattle horn.

Fisher says he has no insur-
ance on Spike, but that doesn’t
worry him. “If something should
happen to him,” he continues, “I
am going to have the nicest tro-
phy on my wall you ever did see.
Nobody else will ever have one
like it. I’ll be able to hang my hat
right here,” Fisher concludes,
pointing to Spike’s head.

Home Again After a Chilling Adventure

Long Journey Ends for Jet the Boxcar Dog

Melinda Stroup With Jet

By ROBERT L. WILLIAMS

FTER an unintentional
6,000—mile solo trip and

more than a month with--

ut food or water, Jet, a
nomadic Labrador retriever, is
safely home again. His survival,
by any estimation, was miracul-
ous.

It was mid-December when Jet
left his home in the tiny town of
Waco, NC, 40 miles west of
Charlotte, and found an open box-
car o'n a westbound freight train.
He went inside. Minutes later
someone closed the boxcar door
and the train departed. It was the
end of the year when the train
arrived in Oregon, and for two
more weeks the boxcar was left
on a siding, unattended.

ALL THIS time Jet was without
food and water. When he was
finally found he was severely
dehydrated and incredibly weak.

The owners, the Roger Stroup
family of Waco, had given up all
hope of ever seeing their pet
again when they received a tele-
phone call that the dog was alive
-— but barely. The dog’s collar

contained the Stroups’ name and
home telephone number, which
the welcome caller used to con-
tact the family. At the time, how-
ever, Jet was too weak to travel,
and for several days he was
treated by the staff of an animal
hospital in Vancouver, Washing-
ton.

The veterinarians, Dr. Jud
Witherspoon and his colleagues

‘at East Mill Plain Animal Hospi-
tal in Vancouver, donated their
services, and warm-hearted peo-
ple m the area donated money for
lab tests and medicine for the
dog.

The vets theorized that Jet
stayed alive by licking condensa-
tion from the walls of the boxcar.

Once he was strong enough to
travel, Delta Airlines donated all
travel expenses. So Jet, in keep-
ing with his name, jetted from
Oregon to Charlotte, NC, where
the Stroups picked him up and
took him back home to a hero’s
welcome and a much-needed
by early last month, nearly
50 days after his nightmarish
trip, Jet was again wandering

about the family yard and farm
— but now with Mrs. Melinda

Stroup keeping him constant
company. She says that even
though the family has a huge
farm, Jet will stay indoors or he
will be closely watched until he is
again adjusted to being at home.

Mrs. Stroup says Jet seems not
to be adversely affected by his

ordeal, except that he now stays

very close to her or other family
members at all times.

And the fan mail keeps coming
in. A local post-office worker says
each day letters arrive for the
dog. Many, he said, are
addressed simply to “Boxcar
Dog, Waco, North Carolina.”

Today, Jet, sleek and healthy-
looking, is friendly, happy, and
contented, having learned the
hard way that there truly is no
place like home.

Friends of Zoo Atlanta

I Address: 800 Cherokee Ave. S.E., Atlanta
30315.

I When established: 1970 as the Atlanta
Zoological Society; the name was changed in
. January 1987.

‘ I Category: Fundraising and support group for
; Zoo Atlanta.

' I Who belongs: Membership ls composed of '

- individuals and families mostly from Midtown and
" Northside neighborhoods, although all metro
areas are represented. Thereis a core group of
' “real doers" rather than meeting-goers, 400 very
active adults ranging from prominent
; corporation executives to “ just good workers."

I How many members: The fast-growing
‘ membership hit 19,100 last week, up from 4,000
| in December 1985. (This number does not
' include individual family members, which when

counted separately put the membership at
approximately 65,000.)

I Who’s eligible for membership: Anyone who
is interested in the 200 may phone 624~WILD
(624-9453) for an application blank or pick one
up at the zoo (at the gate or inthe visitors'
center). The Friends of the Zoo is actively seeking
new members because, to be included in the top
1‘3 zoos in the country in membership, the group
needs 40,000 members -—‘it is projecting 30,000
members by year’s end.

a tnitiation lee: None.

E Eﬁnes: $20 individual, $35 family (both these
memberships include admission to 70 other zoos-
around the United States, a bimenthly
newsietter, and invitations to members~only
events); $60, supporter; $150 and up, patron (the
upper levels of membership receive a
eubecription to Animal Kingdom magazine in
aadition to the privileges listed previeusly. ln
eeiiitien, supperters and patrons will receive
specially designed silk ties or scarves
deelgnating their special membership in the
enemas)

ﬂ gpeeiai leatures: According to Clare

Richardson, executive director of Zoo Atlanta,
“Members join because they want to see a world-
class 200 in Atlanta. Then they become aware of
larger issues such as conservation and the
emphasis on research and scientific projects,
which are natural functions of a zoo.” The

Friends sponsors a major fund-raiser each year ‘

called The Beastly Feast, a glitzy, glamorous »
tented dinner-dance‘on the zoo grounds and an ,

auction of trips and prizes. This year’s event will

feature a hardshat tour of major zoo areas under
’ construction and ”the greatest baby elephant
show on earth,” featuring the 200’s three African

baby elephants, which are being trained to '

perform. The Feast raised $26,000 last year ——
thanks to the Ford Motor Corp., the major

sponsor for the second year. However, Mrs. '

Richardson points out that 74 per cent of the
200’s budget comes from membership fees. ‘

PEOPLE WEEKLY - March 9, 1987

Family tabby Cinnamon ponders a novel problem:

Which will taste better, the food" In the can or the spoon that serves it?

NOW THANKS TO SUZANNA GOODIN,
PETS CAN CLEAN THE BOWL—AND THEN
EAT THE SPOON THAT FEEDS THEM

It was time to feed Ginger and Cinna-
mon, and that meant 6-year-old Su-
zanna Goodin had to dig a spoon into
smelly canned cat food. Pee-yew! She
hated the cleanup afterward even
more. “Mama yells if I don’t wash the
spoon,” says Suzy. “It’s yucky.”

When Ann Gillingham, her first—
grade teacher at the Hydro Elemen-
tary School in Hydro (pop. 1,000), Okla.,
announced that everyone in the class
should come up with an invention for
the Weekly Reader’s second annual in-
ventors’ contest, Suzy decided to see
what she could do about making the
odious task of feeding the Goodin fam-
ily’s two house cats easier. The solu-
tion, Suzy decided, was an edible
spoon, one strong enough to scoop out
the pet food but not so strong that you
couldn’t crumble it up afterward and

leave it in the kitty chow as a gourmet
garnish. The cracker recipe, devised
by Suzy with the aid of her mother,
Jennifer, 30, and her grandmother,
Wanda Gilchrist, 60, is a closely guard-
ed secret, but Suzy admits it has “lots
of garlic—canned garlic, garlic salt, all
"kinds of garlic.”

Suzy’s edible pet-food spoon, one of
200,000 submissions to the Weekly
Reader contest, won the grand prize
for the kindergarten-through-fourth-
grade division. Her award: a $500 sav-
ings bond and an all-expenses—paid
trip to Washington, 0.0 for last
month’s National Inventor’s Expo. She
liked Washington and the Expo, but the
plane ride out, her first, was a problem.
“My mom got seasick of it, and my
brother got seasick of it, and I got real
seasick of it,” she says.

The folks in Hydro were delighted
with Suzy’s win, particularly since the
Goodin family is one of the town’s
hard-luck cases. Suzy’s mom, a part-
time student and lab worker, is di-
vorced and has had difficulty making
ends meet. Last Christmas the town
took up a collection for the Goodins
when Sam, Suzy’s twin, announced at
school, “We’re not having Christmas
this year.” The twins’ older brother,
Seth, 9, is deaf and blind.

The Goodins are hoping that life may
get easier if they can find a backer to
pay the costs of patenting Suzy’s
spoon, or if a pet-food company is will-
ing to buy the idea.

Suzy, meanwhile, is inventing ways
to spend her $500. “I’ m going to use it
for a wedding dress,” she says, “but
not until I’ m at least 18.” E]

 




 

 

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - March 10, 1987

iooElepharrts Enjoy Their Pampering

By Jerry Belcher
@1987, Los Angeles Times

LOS ANGELES
OW DO YOU TRIM the toenails
of a 5-ton elephant?

If this were a corny elephant joke,
the punch line would be: “Very,
very carefully.”

But to the four keepers who work
with the Los Angeles Zoo’s small
herd, elephants are nothing to joke
about, and the handlers are very
careful when they are with the huge
animals, especially during the
pachyderms’ pedicures, baths and
skin moisturizing. ‘

Pedicures? Skin moisturizing?

Such pampering has an important
purpose, keeper Jeff Briscoe said.

Experience has shown that
pampering is vital for creatures as
intelligent, sensitive and potentially
dangerous as elephants, Briscoe
explained. Animals that get a lot of
firm but affectionate attention are

better behaved, easier to work with
and much safer to be around.

So every morning, one of the 200’s
two-member teams of elephant
keepers spends the first 90 minutes
of the day grooming the animals for
the 200’s 10 am. opening.

Because the work is difficult,

' . demanding and occasionally
dangerous, Briscoe and the other

“keepers -—- Gene Nada, Marilyn
Fackler-Gray and George French —
are volunteers, and the elephants
are chained —— one foreleg, one
back leg. . . ,

“Any animal that weighs
10,000 pounds is dangerous,”
Briscoe said, “even if it doesn’t want
to be.”

While the keepers clean up the
barns, the elephants slurp up 20 to

40 gallons of water and munch on j ‘

carrots, onions and a dry snack
called monkey biscuits. (The
elephants’ main meal of oats and
hay is eaten at night.)

 

“I wish it wasn’t so chilly today because
they look so nice after we’ve just washed
them all over. When they go out, I step for a
moment and just look at them, all scrubbed
up, and they’re just beautiful.”

Then the pampering begins.

While a pedicure for an elephant
might seem excessive, Briscoe said
it is a necessity for 200 elephants
because they do not walk as much
as as their wild relatives, who may

~ cover more than 20 miles a day

foraging for food.
Also, contrary to what one might

think, Briscoe said, elephants walk '

on their tiptoes, which makes their
big toenails quite vulnerable to
tearing and cracking.

Confined elephants must have
their toenails and cuticles oiled,
softened, shaped and smoothed
because cracks and rough edges can
be as painful as a human’s hangnail.
They also can cause serious health
hazards to the valuable animals.

The keepers use carpenter’s
drawknives, farrier’s hoof-picks and
long metal rasps to minister to the
animals, who are trained to lift their
feet onto a special stand for the
pedicures. The older elephants
require nail-trimming at least once
a week.

Another essential in elephant
care is the daily bath and skin
moisturizing.

The bath is a must, Briscoe said,
because elephants habitually toss
dust, dirt and hay on their backs,
and they can get pretty gritty and
grimy.

In the wild, Briscoe said, this
behavior is a protective measure —
dirt and grass provide insulation

against heat and protection from
insects.

Briscoe said elephants’ thick skin
is both exceptionally tough and
exceptionally sensitive, prone not
only to bothersome insect bites, but

- also to sunburn, drying, flaking,

cracking and scrapes.

The preferred method of bathing
elephants is with water; they are
squirted with hoses and scrubbed
down with stiff brushes. But if the
weather is chilly, as it was one
morning recently when two guests
were permitted to watch the
routine, the elephants are given
“dry baths" with brushes because,
like humans, they are susceptible to
colds.

“I wish it wasn’t so chilly today,”
Briscoe said, “because they look so
nice after we’ve just washed them
all over. When they go out, I stop for
a moment and just look at them, all
scrubbed up, and they’re just
beautiful.”

The elephants’ feet and legs
were sprayed with water, but none
was completely wetted down.

Gita and Tara, “the girls” as
Briscoe calls them, responded _
quickly to verbal orders to lie down
for their brushing, but 8-year-old
Hannibal, “the kid” to the keeper,
had to be addressed with
considerable volume and firmness
before he-obeyed the command -
“Down!”

Both of the females made ’

croaking sounds as their backs were
being brushed -:a sore sign they
were enjoying the sprucing up,
Briscoe said.

Sometimes, when the elephants
are particularly relaxed and
contented, they make deep purring
sounds, he said.

After the brushing; Briscoe turned
to the two African elephants, Tara,
26, and Hannibal, for a bit of tusk
polishing with steel wool and
scouring powder.

“It’s mainly cosmetic, so their
ivory looks good," he said. “They
are very proud of their ivory.” Gita,
30, the 10,000-pounder, and Joyce,
16, a slinky 7,800 pounds, are Indian
elephants and do not have tusks, but
do not seem to care.

However,,Joyce, like many
teen-agers, has some behavior
problems — she does not get along
well with the others. She is housed
in the 200’s second barn, spends her 0
nights alone and is groomed
separately. By day, she shares a
second display yard with Hannibal

‘but is separated from him by a

heavy steel gate.

The final grooming touch before
the elephants go outside is the skin
treatment.

Briscoe said that at one time
captive elephants were regularly
oiled over their whole bodies, but
that is no longer done at the Los
Angeles Zoo because it was learned
that the oil plugged up skin pores.

Now, he said, a moisturizing oil
called neat’s foot is applied with a
paintbrush mainly to scrapes and
and wear points, such as the
“elbows,” the feet and around the
eyes, where it looks almost like dark
mascara.

Just after 10 am, am all the
washing, trimming and primping

TWA TRIBUNE - March 10, 1987

Animal researth
opponents claim
war not over yet

By JIM SLOAN
Tribune Staff Writer

TAMPA -- His clenched fist raised in de-
fiance, animal rights activist Raini Sequoya
shouted Monday, “We’ll nevergive up," see-
onds after the Hillsborough County Commis-
sion adopted an ordinance that once again
will send dogs and cats from the county
pound to research laboratories.

Sequoya, a leader in the fight to end the
county’s 26-year supply of pound animals for
research, called the commission’s 6-0 vote on-
ly'a “skirmish” in an ongoing battle.

University of South Florida Medical
School spokesman Sally Padgett, however,
said that while the fight over what has been
tagged “pound seizure” may go on, USF has
what it wants - an ordinance giving it ani-

mals for research and teaching.

Monday’s vote means that USF, denied
county pound animals under a court-ordered
ban since last October, will get those animals
again when the new ordinance takes effect in
about 10 days after it is recorded with the
secretary of state.

The ordinance ended a bitter battle that
began last year when a circuit court judge
ruled the county’ 5 current animal control or-
dinance illegal.

The commission responded by scheduling
a referendum on the issue — a vote that won
support by a 2-1 margin last Tuesday. And
Monday night the board changed its ordi-
nance to make the practice legal.

Under the revised ordinance pound dogs
and cats may be sent to USF for research if
they are not reclaimed or adopted.

The new ordinance passed with little de-l

bate from the commissioners, who made only
a few technical changes. It came under fire,
however, from a parade of animal rights and
"animal welfare people.

“This ordinance does not offer any protec-

tion for the animals,” said Humane Society,

Director Phil Snyder, whose lawsuit last Sep-
tember blocked the county from sending
pound animals to USF.

Raini Seqouya raises a clenched fist
and chants “Long live the Animal Lib-
eration Front” as the commission
passes the ordinance.

Snyder had asked, among other things,
that the county’s Animal Control Department
advertise on its literature that it supplies ani-
mals for research labs. The commission de-
nied his request.

“Since they are so proud of the practice of
pound seizure, I believe they should advertise
it as a service of Animal Control,” he said.

See ANIMAL, Page 63

 

Marjorie Angelo of Balance Inc.,
a national animal rights group, said
the ordinance turns Animal Control
into a “cheap research supply
source” instead of a safe haven for
animals.

Sequoya blasted the commission-
ers for allowing dogs and cats to be
used for research they have not wit-
nessed.

“How can you vote in con-
science on an unknown,” he said.

An hour later, as the commis-
sion voted to adopt the ordinance,
Sequoya stood up in the audience
and, barely audible at first, raised a
clenched fist and chanted “Long
live the Animal Liberation Front.”

ALF is a militant group that has
vandalized research labs and stolen
lab animals throughout the country
in its self-proclaimed goal to “liber-
ate” research animals.

As security guards edged closer,
Sequoya repeated his chant, slowly
moving into the hallway outside the
meeting room.

Was he advocating violence?
“Nobody’s going to do any illegal
action,” Sequoya said.

He vowed, however, that the
fight to end pound seizure was not
dead.

“They think this is the end,” he
said. “Those jerks over there (at
USF) think this is the end.

“We’ve lost a skirmish, the bat-
tle goes on. It’ll never end until jus-
tice is done for the animals.” -

Earlier, during the 30 minutes
allowed for public debate, USF staff
and pound seizure proponents de-
fended the practice.

USF professors Joseph Krza- '
nowski and Lewis Nelson told the

‘ commission pound animals were vi-

tal to the university’s research and

teaching programs

In the wake of Tuesday’s lopsid-
ed referendum in favor of pound
animal research, Krzanowski said,
“It’s my sincere wish that we can
put this issue behind us.”

Larry Shriner of the Committee
of Protect Animal Research, a
group spawned during the referen-
dum campaign, said no one was say-
ing anything the commission hadn’t
been hearing for months.

“I’ d just like to get on with sdme
research that’s going to save some
people’s lives,” he said.

Diane Spencer oi the Incurably
Ill Against Pound Seizure, however,
summed up the sentiments ex-
pressed by many anti-research
speakers Monday.

“You’re going to vote on this or-
dinance, ” she told the commission.
“There’s nothing we can do about
it’!

The commission voted 6-0. Como
missioner Jan Platt was absent. She
checked into Humana Women’s
Hospital Sunday for what her aide

- ti ’3: a“?

By Jlngle Davis

Special to The Journal-Constitution

BRUNSWICK, Ga. — In 1967,
Stripe, a female right whale named
by researchers for the distinctive
white marking on her massive fore-
head, was ;shotographed off the
north Florida coast with her new-
born calf. _

This winter, to the amazement
of a group of New England scien-
tists who are studying the rare and
endanger-ed right whales, Stripe
showed up off Jacksonville, Fla,

 

' with another newborn calf.

“This means she was giving
birth 20 years ago and is still at it,”
said Scott Kraus, director of the
right whale project for the New
England Aquarium in Boston.

For the past four winters, the
aquarium has sent Kraus and a
small team of researchers south to
look for the nearly extinct right
whales.

Aided by off-duty Delta Air
Lines pilots from Atlanta who have
contributed small planes and time
to the effort, the researchers have
conducted surveys of coastal waters
from North Carolina to southern
Florida.

Based this year on Amelia Is-
land, Fla., the team concluded its
winter survey this week, Kraus said.

Although Kraus was pleased to
learn that Stripe is still alive and
productive, he said only five or six
mother-and-calf pairs were sighted
during the two-month survey this
winter.

“That’s only about half as many
as we expected to see,” Kraus said.
“And three of the five females were
not familiar to us.”

However, Kraus said bad weath-
er has kept the research team from
making its usual number of flights

\_,.__\\

over the Atlantic, which he said
may have cut down on the numbe
of whale sightings. '

elfraus said the scientists may be
able to identify the unfamiliar fe-
males when the research team re-
turns to Boston and studies photo-
graphs and other file data.

In past years, the majority of
cow-and-calf pairs have been spot-
ted near the shore between Bruns-
wick and Jacksonville, Fla, leading
scientists to conclude that the area
serves as the primary, and possibly
the only, calving ground for right
whales. ,

The mammals are considered
the rarest of all the world’s iarge
whale species.

This year, however, most of the
sightings were beween Cape Canav-
eral and Fort Pierce, Fla, Kraus
said.

“We had a few sightings off
Georgia, but the weather was so
bad we didn’t make as many flights
up there,” he said.

Right whales, which were hunt-
ed almost into extinction during the
last century, have been protected
WM 3937. Scientists say eaiy 2.3%-
te- 406 of the giant mammais sur-
vive along the Eastern seaboard.

Kraus studies the whales during
summer months off the coasts of
New England and Nova Scotia. He
said that the females, which usually
calve every three years, migrate
south to give birth in the warm,

’shallow waters off Georgia and

Florida.

But Kraus said researchers are
still puzzled about where adult
males and the females that are not
bearing young spend the winters.

“We still just don’t know about
the wintering grounds for the ma-
jority of the whales,” Kraus said.

Lord Skelmersdale cutting ribbon and welcoming small traveler at Britain’s first toad tunnel, in Hambleden.

;T he Tunnel of Love, Just for‘Eninsh T bads'

By FRANCIS X. CLlNES
Special to The New York Times

HAMBLEDEN, England, March 13
—— The British opened the nation’s
first toad tunnel under the lethal Hen-

ley roadway here today just in time . '

for the mating season.

The tunnel, the first of a planned.

chain, will begin to ease the burden on
some of the hundreds of British
volunteers waiting by the nation’s
roadsides these nights to help love-
lorn toads by the bucketful cross
safely to breeding ponds. '

With some words of Kipling and a
snip of an appropriately small ribbon
across the six-inch mouth of the tun-
me] Lord Skelmersdale dedicated the
project in the name of Queen and am-
phibian.

“This is the first time I’ve actually
held a toad,” Lord Skelmersdale, the
Government’s Under Secretary of the
Environment, said. “And my sympa—
thy goes very much to the toad.”

The toad he held was driven by car
from its urban pet-tank home in Lon-
don to pose for the occasion in lieu of
its nocturnal country cousins. It
merely blinked at the tunnel opening
when it was first placed down upon
the squishy cold Buckinghamshire
countryside.

A New Traffic Sign

“Cue the toad, mate,” an impatient
photographer instructed.

The Creature was lovingly Watched
by Ann Cook, one of the loyal toad

bearers from the village who have

saved the lives of thousands of toads

in the last three years by shepherding
them across a sharp turn in the A4155
roadway that faces the area’s main,
mating ponds.

”I’ m a 44-year-old granny emotion-
ally involved with toads,” Mrs. Cook
said as drivers gunned their cars,

through the turn, glancing fleetingly
at a new triangular traffic-hazard

sign bearing the large silhouette of a
toad. “Our evenings won’t be the

For. a Feast

Further notes on the gradual extinction of life
as we know it.. . .Or, one night in front of the
TV tube.

Somewhere in the Nevada desert, at the end
of an unmarked road and through a tall gate,
there IS a secret plant that turns out humanoids
for TV commercials.

From wires and sprockets, the plant makes
barf proof, lifelike males. They are indispensable
to American commerce because, not really being
human, they will eat anything.

When the last dab of fleshy prosthetics is ad-
ded, and the jaw mecha-
nism passes a final test,
those assemblages are
packed in crates and
shipped to advertising
agencies.

They become little
boys who drool when
Mom slaps a Steak-Um in
the frying pan. Or happy
husbands who get a whiff
of a frozen “gourmet”
dinner and hungrily grin
from auditory unit to au-
ditory unit.

I’m no food snob I’ve never been to this city’s
culinary palaces, but I did spend an hour once
driving around 1n search of a McDonald’s, finally
snarfing a McD. L. T. on Stanyan.

-. But some of that food on TV looks as appetiz-
ing as bricks. Something has happened. Stuff ad-
vertised for human consumption looks more re-
volting than ever. Meanwhile, pet food
Commercials have never been more elegant.

The Cat’s Meow

.An open can of Fancy Feast is tilted toward
the camera. The announcer describes it as “moist
and delicious.” Delicious might be pushing it a'
bit, but the product does bear a passing resem-
blance to a Manwich SIOppy joe. In the commer-
lcial, it’s served in a crystal bowl. Fancy Feast,
mind you, is for cats.

The small print on a can of Fancy Feast lists
not only lungs, water and guar gum among the in-
gredients, but also iron sulfate, manganese sul-
fate, zinc oxide, copper oxide, ash and cobalt car-
bonate Sounds like a battery to me, though I’m
sure it’s all wonderful in a cat’s tummy. The point
is at least it doesn’t look gross.

Now comes a new dogfood called ONE. It’s all
" ’coxﬁ'mercials right now. ONE

:771e cat
food is the

:bowl

 

 

March 9 , 1987

 

 

From the looks of the TV commercials, the cats are
eating better than the people

stands for Optimal Nutritional Efficiency. My
vague impression is that you have to fill out an
application form and order it at health food
stores, or you’ll be doing Fido a grave disservice.

I lie back in bed. The program drones on to
the next commercial break. Onto the screen at
the foot of the bed comes a meatball the size of a
basketball, and not half as attractive. That is hu-
man food. The meatball is stuck to a ladle or
something. As it turns out, it’s a job for Brillo
pads. My stomach lurches menacingly.

Back to the show. Cutter Amberville punches
his wife and then flies back to New York to club
his son upside the head with a marble ashtray.
Maxi Amberville makes up with Rocco. Cut to
commercial.

A Very Happy Humanoid

A male unit from the Nevada humanoid plant
sits in a sea of special combination platters avail-
able at Denny’s restaurants. He is happy. He’s
even very happy. In fact, he’s wildly happy when
he discovers the special steak and cod dinner.

Now, let’s have a word about steak and cod.
Steak is good. Cod is fine, too, so long as there’s
not a Swede around to soak it in lye. But togeth-
er? I’d rather starve than eat a steak and cod din-
ner at Denny’s.

Matter of fact, I’d sooner eat Fancy Feast.

The heart of the matter

JUST ABOUT the time I think Bill Day has
outdone himself with his drawings, he comes
up with another — the drawing of the

fire fighters everywhere can relate to that.

AS A lover of dogs, I want to commend

The beloved Dalmatian says it all for
everyone: “We have lost some dear friends,
and I am so sad.” The artwork is great, and
the feeling of all is expressed in the dog’s face.
He also has lost some dear friends because, as
we all know, Dalmatians and the fire depart-
ment go hand in hand.

Let voters decide

on leg-hold traps

THE ONGOING debate about the trapping
industry/ sport has generated a great deal of
emotion. As you have probably noticed, the
public response has been in favor of eliminat-
ing the steel-jaw leg-hold trap.

It is time for the Free Press to produce a
photo story that tells the other side of the
story and depicts the horror of the trap with
the same type of illustration and format used
to glorify the trap. -

We need to put this issue on the ballot and
to allow the people of Michigan to vote on
whether this barbaric practice should contin-
ue in our state. This is exactly what the

I

powerful trapping lobby does not want be-.

cause, in spite of its best efforts and, no doubt,
tons of money spent to promote its cause, the
people of Michigan will ban the steel-jaw leg-
hold trap if given the opportunity to decide.

THE DECATUR DEKALB NEIGHBOR - Atlanta — March 18, 1987

A heartwarming‘mil’ unfolds in

. ..—. . . ﬁ-..‘

By Andrea Moret
Neighbor Staff Writer

Wagging tails, wet noses and
warm fuzzy fur stole the hearts of
a handful of DeKalb volunteers so
much they formed the Auxiliary
for DeKalb Animals (ADA) and
gave the county’s stray and lost
furry Sidekicks another chance at
life. .

Nancy Edgecomb and her staff
of volunteers work in collabora-
tion with the DeKalb County
Animal Control Center by provid-
ing healthcare for the center’s
sick and injured cats and dogs, too
irresistible to be left homeless,
before putting them up for adop-
tion. . ‘

Although the center does
provide adoption service, most
people do not want the hassle of
costly treatment for ill animals...
The auxillary thus fills a real need
by attending to the animals’
illnesses with quality veterinary
care.

With many veterinarians
providing services at reduced fees
for the ADA, the service is able to
provide any necessary treatment,

; shots and care for the animals at a
; charge of $25 to the public.

Holding periodic flea markets
and bake sales, the coalition .of

For example, facilities are so
limited the staff is only ableto
provide one food dish for every
five dogs of the 15 animals now up
for adoption. ‘

With the flea market April 11 at
Shamrock Plaza, the staff hopes to
be in a position to supply the dogs
with more feeding bowls.

Ms. Edgecomb stressed the
need to spay and neuter animals,
for much of the over-population,
problem can be prevented. More
than 15 million unwanted animals
were spayed and neuter ed last
year. ~

“With so many animals roam-
ing, we just felt we wanted to
make people more aware of the
spaying and neutering,” said Mrs.
Edgecomb.

Especially in the upcoming
spring season, cats multiply very
rapidly. Only one kitten in every 12
finds a home and if the cat

population is not controlledtheaa

“'13 about two to three months, we

are going to have kittens galore,”
said Ms. Edgecomb.

The auxiliary only deals in cats

and dogs, 90 percent of which are
mixed breeds. Although many of
the animals are strays, Ms.

Edgecomb said all of the animals

they pick up from the animal
control center are all “very sweet
— as if they know they’re some—
thing special.” .

The volunteers, all full-time
employees during the week, com-

'mit their Saturdays to cleaning

cages, feeding the pets and talking
to people about caring for pets.
During the week, any volunteer
work is done out of their homes.
Recently, the auxiliary staff has

reenacted a weekly evaluation by '

volunteer veterinarians who walk
through the control center’s f acrh-
ties to give suggestions that may
be of use for future improvements,

THE

 

nimal welfare

personnel in

the Houston
area estimate that
the number of ani-
mals handled
through their re-
spective shelters in
1986 increased by
more than 10 per-
cent compared to
1985. Ten percent may not sound
too meaningful. When translated
into actual numbers, however, the
figure represents more than 5,000
animals and that’s quite signifi-
cant.

Why the increase, especially
when the numbers had indicated a
trend toward decreasing prior to
1986? The economic crunch affect-
ing this area has not only involved
thousands of people, but it also has
involved thousands of companion
pets'as well. Actually those ani-
mals handled by the various hu-
mane agencies represent only a
fraction of the total problem.

City and county animal control
agencies also report increased
workloads. As the area experi-
ences increased housing foreclo-
sures and resales, more pets are
abandoned in neighborheods or,
worse, left locked up in empty

houses or in fenced enclosures. Un-

fortunately, many of these ani-
mals are left with little, if any,

food and water. They are fright-
ened, apprehensive and, often, be .

come vicious to the extent of hav- ' "l
.. ing to be destroyed. Qi
Fortunately, real estate agents
are concerned enough about these 5 g7
abandoned pets to notify humane _‘
agencies and /or city/county ani- 5‘ 23
mal control. So, what’s the prob- l
lem? Neither government nor hu- t
mane agencies can legally enter ’
private property without a court }
directive and remove the aban- "
doned animal. Removing a pet

A

from private property without ap—
proval from the owner or repre-
sentative is tantamount to theft.
Once again, realty agents have
come to the rescue and assisted
animal agencies on numerous oc-
casions by simply declaring the
pet as theirs or acting as a repre-
sentative of the owner.

This humane action enables the
animal agency to rescue the pet or
admit it into an adoption shelter. I
realize the action taken by real es-
tate personnel is “risky,” but an
animal abandoned for weeks in a
home or yard without adequate
nourishment needs immediate.

Why can’t legal action be taken
against these people who abandon
their pets? They can be prosecut-
ed provided they can be located
and “intentional” cruelty can be
proven. Both of these factors are
difficult to handle as the legal pro-
cedures often moveslowly. The
No. 1 priority is to rescue the poor
pet and, hopefully, place it in a
nice home where companionship
and care prevail.

I urge all families or individ-
uals who plan to relocate in the

companion pet(s) as “family” and
include them in the move. If this.
isn’t possible, call or visit meet
the area’s animal welfare organi—
zations and discuss the policies for
admitting the pet into the shelter.
Whatever is decided, PLEASE
do not leave the pet in an empty
house or fenced yard, and don’t.

Manatee
receives
checkup

KEY BISCAYNE (UPI) — Ju-
liet, a pregnant manatee, became
the world’s first sea cow to get an
ultrasound checkup Saturday, which
showed her fetus is in good 'shape
about two months before birth, a
veterinarian said. '

Dr. Gregory Bossart, staff veteri-
narian and curator at Miami Sea-
quarium, said blood tests had sug-
gested the mammal was expecting,
and the ultrasound tests — similar
to the process used for humans -—
confirmed the pregnancy.

“It does work,” Bossart said.
“We saw a fetal heartbeat.”

Juliet and her mate, Romeo, are
part of Seaquarium’s manatee
breeding program, one of the few in
the nation. She had produced four
calves in the 30 years she has been
in captivity at the Key Biscayne at-
traction.

Bossart said lowering the ultra-
sound equipment into a pool
drained of water, using a block and
tackle, proved to be the toughest
task of the day. Juliet, resting on
the pool floor, seemed uncon-
cerned.

“She’s a sweetheart,” Bossart
said. “She had no problem with
things like that. She just doesn’t like
being turned over.” .

Videotapes and other data will
allow scientists to track the health
of the 3,000-pound manatee and pro-
vide improved understanding of the
endangered species, he said.

Similar ultrasound tests conduct-
ed Saturday on sea lions at the tour-
ist attraction also were successful,
Bossart said.

. “If we’re going to keep these an-
imals in captivity, we really need to
learn as much as we can,” Bossart
said. “This broadens our biological
database. ‘ ' -

“It’s critical if we’re going to

save them from going extinct, we

have to know how they work,” he

said.

The ultrasound examination op-
erates like sonar, producing a visual
outline by bouncing sound waves off
an object. The process produces ani-
mage of the fetus on a television
screen, and computerized measure-
ments show whether the unborn
calf is deveIOping normally.

The manatee, a large animal
that looks like a walrus, has slowly
disappeared from the state’s waters,
mostly through pneumonia and ac-

cidents caused by careless motor-
boat operators. ‘

In 1975, the manatee —- orsea
cow - was designated the Florida
state mammal. .

Bossart said Juliet will give birth
after 13 months of gestation, and
like most manatees should bear off-
spring again in three years. As a re-
sult of the lengthy gestation and
birth cycle, manatees die faster
than they can produce new off-
spring, diminishing their numbers.

Dear Ann‘ Landers: With all the
ranting and raving about animal
rights these days, it is time some-
body spoke out about a so-called
sport. that is nothing but an
atromty. Let me start at the
beginning.

I’m a Nebraska farmer. Last
year some very pleasant
neighbors invited me to go deer
hunting. I applied for and re-
ceived a permit. Since I had
never been hunting, I was totally
unprepared for the events of that
day. I discovered that animals
have no rights, or even a sporting
chance, for that matter. Truck-
loads of hunters jammed the
roads armed with binoculars,
CBs and dogs, not to mention
planes scouting from the skies.

of reader’s fffff anger

So long as an animal is not
brought in, according to the per-
mit, the hunter can keep on
hunting. One man in our party
shot three bucks and all three of
his animals got away. ,

‘ To me, this is a sick way t
have a good time. I will never go
hunting again. To see those beau-
tiful, graceful animals shot down
for the fun of it was horrible.

I know a lot of so-called sports—
men will be angry with me for
writing this letter, but to my way
of thinking, deer hunting is
something animal rights organi-
zations should investigate.

These poor defenseless animals
need help. Certainly someone can
ﬁgure out a more humane way to

.f

control their population. I want

my children to see deer as the
beautiful animals they are, not as
targets in a sick contest between
men and beasts.
A Onetime Hunter From Pierce,

Dear Nebraska: You have writ-
ten a letter that is sure to raise
the hackles of a great many hunt-
ers. If the animal rights people
really want to do something of
value, I suggest they concentrate
on deer hunters.

The devices —— metal grates

Environmentalists say that be-
fore TEDs, thousands of turtles,
many of them endangered,
drowned in shrimp trawls. Most
shrimpers, however, have dis-
puted this claim, and say that
TEDS are unnecessary and allow
their catch to escape.

dent alien living in the United States since
1975, was fined $2,500 and ordered to
serve three years’ probation on the crimi-

nal conviction.

 

But U.S. Magistrate Idance
Africk, saying he hoped to deter
other ﬁshermen from committing
the same offense by punishing
Tran, ﬁned Tran and sentenced
him to the probation.

Tran, who pleaded guilty last
month to the TEDs violation,

'must spend 40 days of his proba-

tion helping the National Marine
Fisheries Service —— the agency
that arrested him Aug. 6 — teach
Avondale area Vietnamese ﬁsher-
men about Gulf Coast fishing
regulations, Africk said.

TEDs foe Tee John Mialjevich
of Gretna, who heads the 3,000-
member Concerned Shrimpers of
America, called the case against
Tran, and his sentence, ridicu-
lous.

“This is a ﬁne example of an

unjustiﬁed regulation that uses
criminal charges to intimidate
people to use a device that
doesn’t work,” he said. “In Loui-
siana, when it clogs up, it kills
the turtles,” Mialjevich said.

The U.S. Commerce Depart-
ment regulation requiring off-
shore shrimpers to use TEDS
provides both civil and criminal
penalties. ‘

Many shrimpers have been
ﬁned civilly, but Tran is one of a

growing number of shrimpers to ‘

be criminally prosecuted far fail—
ing to use TEDS.

Last week, a Florida shrimper
was sentenced to 30 days in jail
for failing to use a TED on his
boat, and" 13 Texas shrimpers re-
ceived suspended jail sentences
and ﬁnes from $1,000 to $5,000
for the same offense. ‘

fying TED law

Douglas Wells of Empire
pleaded guilty in New Orleans
federal court Nov. 20 to not using
a TED. His sentencing is sched-

' uled for next month.

Before Africk sentenced him
Wednesday, Tran, speaking
through an interpreter, said he
always had followed the TED law
except on the day he was caught
without one. That day, he said,
he was trying out a new net. But
Tran said he knew it is illegal to
trawl without the device.

‘ Assistant U.S. Attorney Kim
Garvey, however, told Africk that
Tran‘iknew about the TED regu-
latiOn and had ordered his em-
ployees to rip out such a device
from a net On his boat. .

Tran’s attorney, John Craft of
the federal public defender’s
ofﬁce, urged leniency for his cli-

' ent, saying Tran “works ex-

tremely hard at a business that
seems to be making less and less
money.”

Craft said Tran was arrested
and jailed, when agents simply
could have issued him papers to
come to court. “He’s been made
something of an example of,”
Craft said.

Craft also said there were no
turtles'found in Tran’s shrimping
nets. ~73

From wire reports W
- r

, Rock musicians who were anti-
war activists added a sophisti-
cated twist to their 1960s activ-
ism to help defend the
environment Tuesday in Wash—
ington.

“We have been around long
enough to learn how to use the
s stem,” said Bob Weir 0f the

rateful Dead. “We have con-
tacts in government.

‘ “Back in the 1960s we were
just a bunch of kids protesting
something that was being done to
us and with us, without our con-

‘ sent,” Weir said recently. “This

is once again an instance where
something is being done to us
and with us, without our consent,
but we are not just a bunch of
kids anymore.”

John Oates of the band Hall &
Oates agreed. “I think it’s time
7 the American people start to
make themselves heard again,
and a lot of times musicians tend
‘ to be at the forefront of that,” he
said.

_? Oates, like Weir, sees differ-
. e’nceWh‘W’én‘vi'ro‘n'me'nt‘al
movement and protests against
the war in Vietnam.

.7 “I think people were trying to
work outside the system,” Oates
. said. “Their lack of effectiveness
and the frustration with not
being able to effect change has
caused people to realize that they
can be effective within a system.”

Rock star Paul McCartney
joined forces with the environ—
mental group Friends of the
Earth during his 1990 world tour,
collecting signatures on petitions
at concerts.

“If you get a chance to vote,
tell your politicians to vote for a
clean world,” McCartney told
fans at a Washington concert in
July.

:1 Oates, Weir and songwriter-
singer Carole King have taken an
‘ active role in the Alliance for the
Wild Rockies, a group opposing
deforestation in the Rocky
Mountains and Pacific North-
west. -

I. The organization lobbied Con-
gress this year, seeking to ban
logging across millions of acres in
Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Ore-
gon and Washington.

" OateTsVSaid many Of his friends

and associates in the music bus1-
ness have a growing awareness of
the environment. _

But King said that IS merely a
reﬂection of increasing concern
throughout the general popula-
tion. . _ .

" “I think musmians are just
people who happen to be musr-
cians. The fact we happen to be
famous makes our involvement
more visible,” King said. .

' Weir and Oates joined the Alh-
ance for the Wild Rockies last
summer on a 200-mile bike ride
to examine clear-cutting of na-
tional forests in Montana’s Swan

Valley.
; “Over the past couple dozen

how much of the forest land has
disappeared —— to the pornt Ore-

pretty much ruined to my eyes,
Weir said. . “
King cited Signs of hope. La-
tely I have seen very much
growth in involvement of. famous
and non—famous people in envr-
ronmental issues,” she said.
“People are starting to wake up
now because they walk out their
door and their eyes burn, because
they have to buy their water in
bottles instead of drink it out of
the tap, because they cant go

of water because it is polluted.
ButﬁWe‘ir said more 1nv.olve-

Wayne County Sheriff Marvin

encountered Thibodeaux on a
dirt logging road about 8: 30 p. m.
Shoemake was shot once in the

lower abdomen by a .270- caliber
riﬂe belonging to Thibodeaux.
The riﬂe was seized by deputies,
Farrior said.

Thibodeaux admitted shooting
his riﬂe while Shoemake was in
the vicinity, Farrior said.

“I’d rather not say at this
point if 1. e had admitted shooting
the warden,” Farrior said. “He
has admitted shooting the riﬂe, a

Thibodeaux did not claim self-

PEARL, Miss. —— A profes-‘

sional beaver eradicator will be
paid $1,650 by the city of Pearl to
rid the community of pesky bea-
vers.

“I tried to shoot them and
couldn’t shoot enough to do any
good,” Public Works Director
John Grant said. “They’re caus-
ing bad ﬂooding in some places.
There’s one house we have to go
out to and knock down dams
every time befOre it rains.”

Robert Sperandeo of Terry,

. owner and sole employee of Bea- "

ver Control Service, said'he’ll set
beaver traps next week in six
neighborhoods.

“I have this special trap that

. squeezes a'beaver to death when

he swims into it,” Sperandeo said
Thursday. “If that doesn’t work,
I’ll have'to start shooting them at
nigHtIH _ T"
"He said he can’t move the bea-
vers because they’re territorial
animals. _ '
“If I took them to another

. stream, the beavers that are al-

ready there would attack them,”
said Sperandeo, who has been
trapping professionally for 16
,years. .

A Jackson animal-rights advo-

cate said she understands Pearl’s,

need to prevent ﬂooding, but dis-
agrees with killing the animals in
traps. '

“There are other, more hu- '

mane ways to take care of it,”
said Debra Boswell, director of

the MISSISSIQQI Animal Rescue

League. “There are traps that
wo‘fi’t injure the animals, and
once you’ve caught them you can
administer injections to eutha-
nize them.

“The (Pearl) animal-control
officer has humane traps,” she
said. “We would be happy to sup-
ply those traps. My recommenda-
tion would be for one of the
aldermen to call us about them.”

Sperandeo said he doesn’t.

Pearl’s beaver population.

“I don’t know exactly how
many I’ll kill'——- prObably about
100,” Sperandeo said. “But I’d
say I’m not getting rid of even 1
percent of the beaver population
in Pearl.” ' '

The area provides plenty of
ﬂat, ﬂood-prone areas because of
low elevation and the nearby
Pearl River. Sperandeo said bea-
vers thrive in such conditions be-
cause dam-building .is quick and
easy. . ‘

Sonny Kullman, an employee
of American Supply Co. on US.
80, said dams frequently block a.
creek by the ofﬁce. '

“It’s a lot more of a problem
when we have a lot of rain,”
Kullman said. “We used .to go out
there and tear down their dam
and they’d put it back up that
night.” 7 . .

WASHINGTON — Rep. Bob
Livingston said Friday the Army
must offer “compelling reasons”
to resume controversial research
at Louisiana State University
Medical; Center in which cats
were shot in the head so re-
searchers could study gunshot
wounds.

“1 met with Army officials
(Friday) and told them that I

 

‘ share their goals and' agree there

are times when animal research
is justiﬁed,” said Livingston, R-
La. “But they ought to be sensi-
tive to the legitimate concerns of
people about doing unnecessary
research and they are going to
have to prove that this is not
unnecessary.”

Livingston made his comments
as he released a study by the
General Accounting Ofﬁce, which
gives mixed reviews to the cat-
shooting experiments.

The research, in which pellets
were ﬁred into the heads of about
700 anesthetized cats to study re-
sults and thusimprove treatment
for battleﬁeld head injuries, has
become a national symbol of the
conﬂict between some medical re-
searchers and animal rights ac-
tivists.

The project, which began in
1983 with a $2 million Army
grant, was suspended 13 months
ago after complaints that the re-
search was inhumane and inef-
fective.

Livingston, who asked for the
GAO study, expressed strong
doubts that the research should
continue. He would be the key
player in any congressional ac-
tion on the cat—shooting experi—
ments.

“Since 1983, the (Defense)
Department has spent over $1.5
million on this research which
has involved over 700 cats,” Liv-
ingston? said. “Given this, I do
not think it is unreasonable to
pose the question: What realis-

? tically can be ascertained from

continuing experiments and
spending half a million dollars;
and possibly more, of taxpayers
funds?” .
A spokeswoman for LSU said
the university was unable to com-

! ment either on the GAO’s ﬁnd-

ings or Livingston’s views on the
experiment’s merits. The univer-

sity has not seen the study, nor

have LSU ofﬁcials spoken with
Livingston about the prOJect
since the study’s release, she said.

In addition, the principal re—

searcher, Dr. Michael Carey, is
on active duty as a neurosurgeon
attached to a medical unit acti-
vated as part of the Pers1an Gulf
callup. He has not seen the ﬁnal

GAO study either, the LSU
spokeswoman said.

Members of the Army Surgeon
General’s staff were not available
for comment Friday.

The research produced a scien-
tiﬁc paper suggesting that brain-
injured people might sponta-
neously resume breathing long
after they stopped breathing
unassisted. One of Carey’s assom-
ates also has said the team was
investigating the use of a prom-
ising drug when'the research was
stopped.

In addition, a panel of neuro-
surgeons that examined the pro-
ject for the GAO found that it
was doing worthwhile research.

But the GAO said the medical
panel, led by Dr. John Jane, a
neurosurgeon at the UniverS1ty of
Virginia, expressed. concerns
about the administration of gen-
eral anesthesia and post-opera-

tive care for the cats.

Another panel of veterinary
anesthesiologists said the validity
of some research might have
been jeopardized by the anes-
thesia. It also joined the first
medical panel in questioning
post-operative care for the cats.

LSU was aware of the crit-
icisms in an early draft of the re-
port, and ﬁled detailed rebuttals.

The GAO concluded that the
Army should decide whether

continuing the research will “pro- '

duce additional useful informa-
tion.” If so, the GAO said, the
Army should ensure that LSU
corrects deﬁciencies cited by the
medical panels.

controversial experiment, has

sume the experiments. But time

restrictions tied to the release of
the GAO report make it unlikely

that the project could resume be-
fore February.

Livingston said he believes the
Army had good reason to enter
into its contract with LSU.

“I think it is important to note
that the original purpose of this
research, if not the research
itself, is valid,” Livingston said.
“Treating battlefield head
1njuries is a serious problem for
Army doctors. Research in this
area can save lives, and if we are

battle, the absolute least we can
do is. to fund quality research in
treating injuries.”

Suzanne Roy, spokeswoman
for In Defense of Animals, a na-
tional animal rights group, said
that the GAO report should settle
the question once and for all.

“The GAO ﬁndings, combined -
with the numerous doctors and i
thousands of taxpayers who have
called for an end to this study,
should convince Congress to per-
manently cancel this cruel and
useless experiment,” she said.

Dear Concerned Citizen:

This is in response to your recent letter concerning enforcement of the
Animal Welfare Act (AWA). ‘

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is responsible for administering the
AWA. The AWA provides for licensing of anyone dealing or selling animals in
the wholesale channels. The AWA also provides for the proper care, handling,
feeding, watering, housing, cleaning, sanitization of facilities, and
veterinary care of animals. USDA personnel perform unannounced inspections to
ensure compliance with the standards.

 

The regulations provide for the keeping of accurate records on the acquisition
and/or disposal of animals covered in the AWA. The regulations also provide
for the prosecution of anyone buying, selling, or transporting stolen animals
in commerce. Should we find evidence to support allegations of stoleg animals
being used in research, or any licensed facility that is dealing in them, we
will strive to see that the stolen animals are returned to their owners. We
will also diligently seek prosecution of persons guilty of the theft. You may
be assured that we have and will continue to seek the convictions of anyone
who is found to be in violation of any of the regulations that pertain to the
AWA.

In June of this year, a task force of 12 trained investigators finished an
intense, 3-month investigation into the allegations of stolen pets being
brought into the licensed dealer's network for research or other purposes.
The report revealed no evidence to support the allegations of stolen pets
being sold into research. Should evidence become available to support the
allegations, we will investigate and prosecute if we find dealers or research
facilities knowingly handling stolen animals.

Thank you for your comments. we appreciate your concern for the welfare of
animals. » '

Sincerely,

Mex/ﬂ

By Cox Nova": 82 rvice f E
The latest AIDS vaccine to be
tested in human beings is being
cautionsly described by scientists
as the moSt promising develop-
ment in the urgent search for an

effective immunization against
the Virus.

 

The vaccine is the only one.
proven to prevent AIDS infection
1n chim a es, according to the
National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, which helped
develop the vaccine. There are
SIX AIDS vaccine candidates
being or about to be tested on hu-
mans. Last month, the vaccine
received approval for clinical
tests on humans from the Food
and Drug Administration.

“This is promising, but we
really try to present this news in

, alow-key way so no false hope is
g1ven,”.said Dr. John McGowan,
associate director 0 the insti-
tute’s research and development
program for AIDS. “We’re hop-
1ng it’ll have a beneﬁcial response

1n humans as well as chim—
panzees.”

This does not mean that the
vaccine will be available soon. It
Will be among several compo-
nents in a “cocktail” vaccination

that might be available in several .

years, McGowan cautioned.

It took more than 15 years for
the hepatitis B vaccine to move
from the laboratory to doctors’
ofﬁces because of the complex-
ities surrounding vaccine devel-
opment.

McGowan. is also cautious
when describing this latest step
in vaccme development because

‘ ,, ’.,._..»-r

when “any slight encourage-
ment” was given to the public
that an AIDS vaccine was in the

works, people tended to indulge “

in more behavior that put them
at risk.

“They feel that maybe they
can wane on any prohibitions
they’ve put on themselves as far
as sexual practices, but they
really can’t because nothing is
going to happen soon” in devel-
oping a vaccine, he said.

Simple efficacy testing ——
checking a vaccine’s effectiveness
at combating AIDS —— for any of

 

'_the candidates is still probably at

least thr‘ or four more years
away, McGowan said. etting
FDA approval for use would take
at least afew ears ore.

Michael Merdian, executive di-
rector of th’é'Washington, DC.-

(7—. A

based National Associ tipn of
People with AIDS, says cutting
time-consuming bureaucratic
steps in vaccine development
could considerably shorten the
time it takes for development and
distribution. His biggest criticism
is the lack of information avail-
able about AIDS-vaccine testing
sites.‘

“I think that information
should be more widely available
so people can be more involved,”
Merdian said.

The latest vaccine will be
tested at St. Louis University
School of Medicine, St. Louis;
Johns Hopkins University Center
for Immunization Research, Bal-
timore, Md.; the University of
Rochester Medical Center, Ro-
chester, N.Y.; the University of
Washington School of Medicine,

._....___._._.—._..-.. p .

Seattle; and Vanderbilt Uiiiver-
sity Medical Center in Nashville,
Tenn. . g *

The vaccine’s effectiveness has
been tested only in animals, with
human testing limited tqé’jmeasur-
ing the level of immuneifres’ponse
stimulus. Testing participants
must be giventhe HIV-gvi'rus, the
human immunodeﬁciency virus
that causes AIDS, after‘the vac—
cine is administered to determine
its true effectiveness. If a volun-
teer doesn’t test positive, the vac-
cine works. »

A chimpanzee —— regarded as
the best animal model for study-
ing AIDS immunization —- was
protected from HIV infection for
nearly three years in pre-clinical
studies of the latest candidate,
according to Immun - .SMInc. of
Rochester Mic ., which helped

devmcine. This is the

---——————_—-

A...

longest known period of pro-

. tection of any AIDS vaccine
‘ studied in animals, company offi-

cials said.

The key to developing an effec-
tive vaccine that would prevent
AIDS infection is ﬁnding some-
thing that stimulates the body to
produce antibodies that woul
cause immune-sybsltem cellls to
attack the virus. 0 one nows
how many strains of’KID‘S—there
are andﬂhether a vaccme would

protéCt onl a' ainst the strain
used in the test or whether it also
woul fig t t e many ot #er forms
of thivirus.

Most research has focused on
developing immunizations that
will protect healthy people from
getting the AIDS virus. But SCI-
entists also are testing the vac-
cines’ ability to protect infected
people from getting sick.
