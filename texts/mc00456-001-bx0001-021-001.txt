Hstounding Increase oi the Fur trade.

THE BOARD OF TRADE RETURNS of the fur imports and exports for

 

the past year, 1910, show a great expansion of the trade in furs.

The total number imported into this Country during 1910 was
one hundred and twelve million, seven hundred
and ninety-ﬁve thousand, nine hundred and
eighty-nine skins.

These numbers show an increase of twenty-two
millions, nine hundred and ninety - nine
thousand, fourhundred and twenty-two skins
over the previous year, the imports during 1909 being eighty~four
million, three hundred and eighty-four thousand and ninety skins.

The fatal effects of the wholesale slaughter are making themselves
felt. One instance will sufﬁce. The special correspondent of the
“Fur World» and Skin Trade Gazette,” issue Feb., 1911, writes,
“ Squirrel hunting this year has been successful.” He adds that in the
Siberian prOducing centres “ the little animal has been too vigorously
hunted, and according to the hunters themselves in many districts is
not now to be found?" What wonder, when on the ﬁgure of one
fur-clad woman the backs or breasts of several hundred squirrels

may be counted?

The mind quails before the appalling massiof misery represented

by these statistics.

Commenting on the horrors revealed in this booklet a clergyman
writes, “For myself, Wife and daughter, I can promise that never
shall we expend one penny on furs. Each time I see them I think of
the blood and tears of innocent victims with which they are bedewed.”

If every reader would think and act thus, we should soon see an

end of this bloodthirsty and unholy trade.
