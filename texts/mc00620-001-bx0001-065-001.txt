“Ah! old stanch friend ,ﬂyvith your deep,
clear eyes and bright, (iuidt glanﬁes that
take in all one has to say before one has
time to speak it, do you know you are only
an animal and have no mind? Do you
know that dull-eyed gin-sodden lout lean—
ing against the post out there is immeas-

urably your intellectual superior? Do you

know that every little-minded, selﬁsh
scoundrel, who never did a gentle deed or
said a kind word, who never had a thought
that was not mean or low, or a desire that
was not mean and base, whose every action
is a fraud, and whose every utterance is a
lie—Clo you know that these crawling
skulks are as much superior to you as the
sun is to a rush light, you honorable, brave—
hearted, unselﬁsh brute? They are men,
you know, and men are the greatest, noblest
and wisest and best beings in the whole
vast, eternal universe! Any man will tell
you that—[Jerome K. Jerome in “Three
Men in a Boat.”
