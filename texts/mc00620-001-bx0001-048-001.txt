The Presbyterian Church and Humane Education
By Rev. Dr. Charles Scanlon ‘

General Secretary of Presbyterian Church Board of Temperance and Moral Welfare

HERE are in this country

about 233,000 churches. We

have 195,000 ministers. There
are about 45,000,000 church mem-
bers. I am speaking of Catholic
and Protestant, Jew and Gentile.
We have 199,000 Sunday schools,
and 21,000,000 children in these
Sunday schools.

Speaking of our own church, or
the one to which I belong: In the
Presbyterian denomination we have
between nine and ten thousand
churches. We have approximately
10,000 ministers. .We have 1,300,-
000 children in the Sunday schools.
We have more than 1,600,000 com-
municants in the churches. This
latter body is the one with which I
am connected. It is this that comes
and offers Whatever inﬂuence it has,
and Whatever help it may be able
to render in the ﬁeld of humane
service. ’ ,

I remember years ago a thing that
came to my attention. A man with
two heavy grips was running to the
train, and got there just as it moved
off. Someone said to him, “Well,
my friend, you did not run quite
fast enough.”

“Yes, I did all I could.”

“You didn’t get there.”

“Well, I didn’t start soon enough.”

The church is not running too
slowly. It did not start soon
enough. It has started now. It is
ready to do what it can.

There are some eight or ten great

historicvmevils of the world. We
haVeﬁwar, intemperance, impurity,
slavery, lying, gambling, stealingﬁ:
idolatry "and cruelty. These have“:
run through all the ages. There is
no question about the earnestness'
or zealousness or courage or sacri-
ﬁce of the people who have been
dealing with these evils. But are
there not forces Which—may be en-
listed which have not already been
enlisted in combating these “great
evils? The church is one of them.

I have spoken of this vast army
of 45,000,000 people. Not all 'will he
enlisted. Not all will be faithful
who start. Not all will be efﬁcient
who try. Not all will be wise in
their endeavors. But it still re-1
mains true that today no institution
inlthe world is comparable to the
church for earnestness, sacriﬁce and
devotion. With all her faults, and
they are many; with her limitations,
and they are numerous, it still re.-
mains true the Church of the Living
God is the best, institution today.
It underlies Whatever else we do—
this army that it is proposed to en-
deavor to bring into this ﬁeld of
work which is new to itself.
. “Just what,”~someone will be sav-
ing, “does the Presbyterian Church
expect to do? What are its aims?
What is its program?” i

Let me say, ﬁrst of all, the Pres—
byterian Church does not propose to
do case work especially. It is prop- ‘
aganda work. We hope both in
spirit and in method so to conduct
this work that every humane so-
ciety, however small or humble it
may be; that every individual

 

  




 

  

worker, however lonely and modest
he may be, will be stronger and
more courageous and more enthu-
siastic because of What we under—
take to do. It is to supplement and
not to supplant. ,We hope the Hu-
mane Society in Omaha will ﬁnd in
Presbyterian and in other churches
a more congenial atmosphere in
which to carry on its activities; that
when it goes to the churches any-
where it will not be, “This is an—
other outside organization making
an appeal for a hearing.”
Henceforth, humane work is just
as much a part of t e p ogram of the
Presbyterian Church as the or
foreign missions, as Sunday 57117361,
as education, as ministerial relief,
or any other enterprise of the de—
nomination. It is supported in ex—
actlynthwemsangeray. The contribu-
tions are by proper authorities ap—
portioned to the several boards.
They are devoted foriiiiis'éwinw such
lines as they may deem wise. The
Board of Temperance, and Moral
Welfare, with which I am con-
nected, was formerly the Board of
Temperance. We hope the time

will come“. when we will be fully '

warranted in dropping the word
“Temperance.” We will not for—
get, while we have legal prohibition,
the broncho has only 1525613 bridled.
He has not quit kicking yet. We
are carrying on teiiiperance~work at
home and abroad, and we are en—
deavoring to elect men to Congress
and the state legislatures who will
enforce prohibition and make it per—
manent and effective. We are also
carrying temperance work abroad,
working in seventeen different coun—
tries.

Then we have our work of hu—
mane education. VVe have not
worked out all the plans yet. It
was committed to us only a few
months ago. We are making an

earnest effort in this line, and study-
ing it as intelligentl as we may.
That is whymerg to learn from
you men and women of the most
practical experience that I can get.
We are preparing to offer prizes for
poster contests in the gamma
other organizations are not doing it.
We do not propose to compete with
other societies. We are only too
glad to cooperate with them in any
way we can.

We shall not convert the world——
we shall not convert the whole Pres-
byterian Church—on humane work,
suddenly. But we do hope in an .
earnest, straightforward, sincere
manner to do-something—to make
some contribution to a cause that
has been/tpo long neglected.
carry you over the United States
into some Presbyterian Church, and
you don’t gain the ready admission
you would like, don’t imagine the
church is absolutely failing and all
its professions will come to naught.
I have gone to a good many
churches when they did not let me
in, and I have had a feeling they
did “Qt-..1_§,tmt.1}9-- Lord in, either. So,
maybe, they won’t'vletmiyOu in. But
let us be fair and reasonable in our
humane work, as we try to be in
other things. Not all ministers will
be sympathetic. Ministers are fal-
lible like otherwmen. They will not
always cooperate.

\Ve hope to create a s m athetic,
helpfuLjImosphere in the Presby-
terian denomination. You can help
us to do this in a large way by your
literature, your magazines, by all
those channels that are known to .
you better than to me. Get the in— ‘
formation to these men. Get them
ﬁlled with enthusiaSm and knowl—
edge and zeal, an‘CT’they will biewji‘fst
as earnest on that as onwpeverythi‘ng
else.
