POPULATIONS WITH ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO INSECTS. Entomologist 90: 195-203.

1957. [From J. Anim. Ecol. 28(1).]

"It is concluded from this discussion of the existing theories and opinions
regarding the natural regulations of animal populations that restrictions by
territory, suitable nesting sites, and shelters are probably the most important
densityhdependent factors controlling larger animals, whereas insect populations
are probably more frequently checked by natural enemies and the importance of
food shortage in regulating them has in most cases been exaggerated."

Dept. Fish & Game.) THE USE OF PROBABILITY SAMPLING FOR ESTIMATING ANNUAL
NUMBER OF ANGLER DAYS. Calif. Fish a. Game h5(h): 303-311. Oct. 1959.

Describes the results of three sampling plans: simple random and stratified
random with proportional and optimum allocation. Sample sizes were computed
for the three methods under specified criteria. An interesting application of
standard procedures found in Cochran, W. G. 1953. Sampling techniques, John
Wiley and Sons. The procedures followed are easily extended to game kill
statistics and it is amazing that comparisons of this type have not been made.
--V. Schultz.

 

Chapman, D. G. (U. Wash., Seattle.) THE ANALYSIS OF A CATCH CURVE.
Biometrics 15(3): h89. Sept. 1959.

T e age distribution of a random sample from a stable animal population
provides information on the mortalitﬁ rates of the population. In this paper
the maximum.likelihood estimates of‘ﬁhe mortality rate and its asymptotic
variance are given. The assumptions underlying the more usual regression
estimate are studied critically. If the population is not stable and in
particular if the recruitment varies over time, the estimates of mortality rates
are biased. The nature of this bias is studied for various possible situations.
Finally, it is shown that the estimation of the components of mortality due to
natural causes and exploitation by a regression of catch per unit of effort on
effort can also be applied to a single catch curve. The procedure is dependent
on the assumption of constant recruitment but otherwise has several advantages
over the standard application of the procedure to a series of catch per unit of
effort data.--Author's abst. supplied by V. Schultz.

Cox, D. R. PLANNING OF EXPERIMENTS. John Wiley & Sons, N. Y. 16. 308 p.
1958. $7.50. [From Am. Sci. h7(2).] ‘

"This book, intended for workers in the experimental sciences, describes the
basic ideas underlying the statistical aspects of the design of experiments and
the types of design most commonly used. Throughout, the emphasis is on planning
rather than on statistical analysis of results. This limitation of scope enables
the author to discuss important aspects of planning more thoroughly than other
writers on the subject—-the discussions of the use of supplementary observations,
of randomization, and of the types of factor in factorial analysis are especially
good. The writing is clear, interspersed with much shrewd and thoughtful advice
on problems that arise in planning. The book can be very highly recommended as
probably the best general introduction to the design of experiments now available
to the non-statistician."-4W. G. Cochran.

Monroe, John, and A. L. Finkner. HANDBOOK OF AREA SAMPLING. Chilton Co.
(Book Division), Philadelphia, Pa. Vii + 55 p. 1959. '_‘

"The purpose of this handbook is threefold: (l) to bring together the
various definitions and procedures involved in the construction of an area
frame, (2) to illustrate the use of the frame in drawing a random sample, and
(3) to Show the adaptability of the materials to several commonly used sample
designs." It is concerned with a sampling procedure which has been applied to
wildlife surveys (WR 68: 3, 71: 9, 76: 1h, 77: h, 80: h, 86: 19, 87: 2h).--

The following is a small portion of an extensive review by William H.

Kruskal appearing in Journal of American Statistical Association Volume 53, No.
282, pages 595-598. "This book is primarily an elementary exposition of applied
nonparametric analysis for research workers in the social, biological, and
medical sciences. The first third of the text proper is a general introduction
to statistical inference. Some short-cut parametric techniques, mostly
involving the use of sample ranges, are briefly discussed. There are 28 pages
of tables and graphs. Numerous problems with real data are set, and answers or
discussions for them are collected at the end of the book. Printing appears to
have been done directly from typescript.

"The book, in my opinion, does not adequately fulfill its purposes, and the
world still awaits an acceptable introductory textbook for applied nonparametric
analysis." The reviewer continues his discussion with a justification of his
opinion and lists many errors, ambiguities and omissions.--V. Schultz.

Animal welfare Institute. BASIC CARE OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS. Revised ed.
Animal welfare Institute, 22 East 17th St., N. Y. 3, N. Y. 68 p., illus.,
paper. 1953.

"This edition, like its predecessor published in 1953, was prepared especially
for newcomers to the important work of giving proper care and attention to
animals used for experimental purposes. Its purpose is to present briefly, in
non-technical language...the basic needs of the common laboratory animals and
to provide praCtical suggestions on how to meet them." It appears to fulfill
its purposes very well. Included are sections of a general nature treating
the needs, housing, reproduction and breeding, disease prevention, and parasites
of laboratory animals. Specific instructions on the care of 8 common laboratory
mammals make up the bulk of the pamphlet. Other vertebrates and their care is

described.

A description of the procedure, techniques and equipment developed for the
night-lighting of pheasants and other animals in east-central Ill. This
equipment consists of a truck-type vehicle, gasoline generator, floodlights,
Spotlight, and a long-handled net. "There were never nights, regardless of the
weather or the behavior of the pheasants, in which night—lighting did not yield
a sufficient capture of pheasants to make the operation worth while." For 1,33h
pheasants handled in night-lighting operations, the mortality rate attributed
to these operations was 2.h%.

Dear Miss Stevens:

This is in reply to your letter of August 29, 1960 calling to our
attention the fact that you have received a request from a high school
teacher for "Basic Care of Experimental Animals", as listed in the
Source of Free and Inexpensive Materials.

we have checked all our lists of Sources of Free and Inexpensive
Materials that we are now distributing, and we can assure you that
"Basic Care of Experimental Animals" is not listed. Evidently the
teacher had consulted an out-dated list.

'we certainly appreciate your bringing this to our attention. we also
. appreciate receiving the copies of “First Aid and Care of Small Animals"
and "Humane Biology Projects". Thank you for your interest and cooperation.
Sincerely yours,

NATURAL RESOURCES & CLIMATE

Allen, Shirley Walter. CONSERVING NATURAL RESOURCES. Second edition.
McGrawAHill, New York 18, N. Y. 370 p., illus. 1959. $6.75. [From review by
J. V. K. Wagar, J. For. 57(7).]

The first edition was good and this one is better. It has the unity and
compactness that is possible when one man writes a whole book. Yet it has much
of the profundity and breadth that is sought through multiple authorship.
Chapters are: 1. Introduction. 2. The Land, the Soil, and Conservation. 3.
Water and the AtmoSphere. h. Forests, Grazing, and Recreation. 5. WildaAnimal
Resources. 6. Mineral Resources. 7. Human Powers and Natural Resources.
Teachers who adopt this text may receive gratis the paper Suggestions to
Teachers for the Use of Conservin Natural Resources, which helps adapt—the
{cit to CSEFSEE-df—different Iengéhs. AIIen accents conservation through
organizations more than he does conservation by individuals. Increasing,
overlapping demands for space that torment land managers are emphasized. The
slow and cautious machinery of democracy and its advantages and responsibilities
thread through the book. On the whole, the book reveals an impressive attention
to changes of recent years, and it incorporates an accuracy that few individuals
could equal.

h figs. + 3 folded colored maps Z§l x 29 i577.__Nov. I958._7$2.00.

The three maps of eastern North America (Me. and James Bay west to the 96th
meridian) depict annual values of potential evapotranspiration, water surplus
and water deficit. These values are based upon information obtained from about
2,500 climatological stations. The accompanying text describes methods of
measuring evapotranspiration, and computing water balance. Areal differences
and yearly fluctuations in water balance are discussed.--Paul F. Springer.

CODFISH CATS AND CIVILIZATION. Doubleday & 00., Garden City, N. Y. 263 p.
1959. $3.95. ___._____ ‘ “‘

A popular account of the interactions of man and other animals from pre-
historic times to the present. Anecdotes and facts are interspersed to provide
interesting reading. Wildlifers should find the chapters on the starling,
Norway rat, bison, wolf, bear, and rabbit informative.. There is a gripping
account of the century since the introduction of the rabbit to Australia.
webster traces the history of rabbit control from "rabbit proof" fences to
viruses that induce myxomatosis. He mentions reductions in the magnitude of
96% for rabbits in Australia, but to use his words "...in spite of a smashing
victory at the mid-point of the twentieth century, man has by no means ex-
terminated his nibbling foe... Given a few generations, changes in rabbits or
virus could reduce the mortality rate--and resistant bunnies could multiply to
regain their old status. After all, rabbits have been around for quite a
while..." Man‘is a biological youngster who has been on the scene a relatively
short time.

Dear Miss Draper:

we appreciated very much your cooperation in sending us the 20 copies of
"BAﬁlC GAR? SF EXPTRIFPNTAL ANIEALQ" which you so willingly sent to us in
late December. This has proven to be a very informative booklet, and there—
fore

we would like to use them for our student lectures in the near future.

Could you possible send us 150 additional COpies? This would enable us to

distribute them to the students, allowing them to follow along as the lectures
proceedé¢...and at the same time, they will have a permanent guide to the care
and handling of laboratory animals.

N.You might include a copy of "COWFQRTARLF QUARTERS FOR LABORATORY ANIMaE*" with

Thanking you in advance for your cooperation....

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mrs. Draper:

Thank you for your prompt response to my request for
materials for use in a classroom.

Your offer of the cepies of "Basic Care of Experimental

with alacrity. We would need 100 copies. 1 hope this

is not going to tax you. Should there be a charge, please
let me know.

At the present time we have 55 animal caretakers working
in Animal Quarantine, plus another 30 workers working
with the laboratory animal in the laboratory.

Laboratory Facilities and Equipment

. Howard H. H illemzmn, Oregon State University, Corvallis

In the following brief articles, the author describes a remarkably complete series of
laboratory facilities which were improvised or made to order. Many unique ideas are
present-ed here which are usable by biology teachers at all levels of instruction. The
author is Professor of Zoology. This is Research Paper No. 445, Oregon State University,

School of Science, Department of Zoology.

A General Purpose Storage Cabinet for the
Anatomy and Embryology Laboratory

A very convenient, useful, and relatively
inexpensive general purpose storage cabinet
for skeletal materials, jars of preserved speci—
mens, models, and plastic embedded teaching
materials, is that illustrated in Figure 1.

This cabinet is 7 feet high, 8 feet wide, and
22 inches deep (front to rear). Three doors,
each 29% inches wide, 6 feet and 4 inches
high, and double glazed (for continuing in~
ventory) 1n 2 inch framing provide access to
the interior. Each door, supported by 3
hinges, has also a knob and lock. The facing
on the sides and top are 2 inches wide and
the skirt below 15 5 1/; inches high.

Each compartment (3) is provided with
4 adjustable shelves to accommodate items of
different heights. The ﬂoor of each com—
partment provides another shelf and the top
of the cabinet is used for excessively large
objects.

The entire cabinet (except for some hard—
ware) is constructed of fir and given a clear
natural ﬁnish (lacquer). It rests on an angle
iron frame recessed below, and rides on 8
double rubber casters. The frame and casters

Figure 1

provide for rigidity and mobility (ﬂexible
furniture arrangements).

This cabinet was constructed in 1959 by
the O.S.U. Physical Plant at a cost of $250.00.

Storage Cabinet for Embryology Slides

A cabinet designed to store 4,800 slides
for the embryology class, and valued at
about $10,000.00, has been found very
satisfactory. It is presented in the accom—
panying Figures 2 and 3 (door open). Such
a cabinet is also very useful in storing re—
search slides.

The cabinet is 7 feet high, 211/2 inches
wide and 101/2 inches deep (front to rear).
The top skirt is 1% inches high; the bottom
skirt is 3% inches high and recessed %; inch.
The door whose trim pieces are 1% inches
Wide has three glass panels for quick inven-
tory of cabinet contents. These panels are
separated by one— inch strips. The door is
supported by four hinges, is equipped with
a lock and knob, and also has a stop in front
of the toe- -space recess.

The two sections in the cabinet are
separated by a 3/; inch thick partition; each
section is subdivided into 30 slide box com-
partments, giving a total storage capacity of
60 boxes.

Each slide compartment is 9 inches wide,
7% inches deep (front to rear) and 2%;
inches high. The box compartments are
separated by IA, inch masonite sheets set
21/2 inches on center, and recessed into
notches on either side. A half—round strip
obscures these notches on the center divider,
and 1/; inch round strips serve the same
function on either side. Each compartment
accommodates the 100 capacity wooden slide
box which is 8% inches wide, 71/2 inches
front to back and 11/2 inches high.

The side walls and back of the cabinet are
of 34 inch ﬁr and so also the middle member.

Gentleman:

Your excellent booklet entitled "Basic Care
of Experimental Animals" has produced many favorable
comments from our animal care personnel. It also
vaguely recalled to me a reference to a sound film
produced in England, covering the basic care and
handling of laboratory animals. Unfortunately, the
recall is not clear enough for me to remember the
title of the film. I would appreciate receiving from
you any information which you may have concerning
such a film and its availability on a rental basis.

Sincerely yours,

To Users of the AWI manual, ”Basic Care of Experimental Animals":

  

We wish to ask your advice based on your experience with "Basic
Care of Experimental Animals". Only a few copies remain of the 7,500 which
were printed. We are considering two possibilities: l) Revising and
reprinting the manual in approximately the same form as it now exists, or
2) Producing a different type of manual for the training of animal technicians
or caretakers. It has been suggested, in the latter category that A) a com~
plete set of lectures for a training course be published or B) lecture
outlines for a training course be published.

 
 

Your experience with our present manual would be a most valuable
guide to us, and we should greatly appreciate your response to any or all oi
the following questions:

         
      
   
   
   
    
   
 
 
   
   

1) Should "Basic Care of Experimental Animals" be kept in print?
A) If so, what additions and corrections would you 1

ihe to see
made? (detailed criticism and suggestion is inVite?

o.)
B} Would you wish to have a copy or copies of a revised edition?

2) Would you prefer to have a manual for training animal room
personnel which would be used by the teacher of the course
instead of being addressed to the person being taught?

A) If so, in what form would you like to have it appear?

B) Have you taught such a course? (suggestions on teaching
methods, lecture notes, etc., are invited.)

U.)
V

Would you like both publications, or one that has not been
mentioned? (If so, please specify)

Thank you very much for your attention to this communication. We
are anxious to provide the materials best suited to ensuring first~rate care
and humane treatment for laboratory animals in all institutions using them,
and your assistance would be much appreciated. A self-addressed envelope is
enclosed for your convenience in replying.

Dear Sirs:

Some time ago you were kind enough to send a few e0pies of your
book BASIC CARE OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS. These were greatly
appreciated. However, my supply is depleted. I have charge of
one of the more populous of our animal rooms. These books have
been given to those asking for quarters if there was any doubt
that they knew how to care proPerly for their animals. Everyone
has found them very helpful in instructing the students as to
animal care.

Would it be possible to obtain at least a dozen more? If there
is a charge, please bill me here.

Thank you for your valuable help in our teaching program.

Sincerely,

i
