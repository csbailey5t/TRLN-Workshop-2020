Eﬂect of sugar feeding on carcass weight during chilling

in table 4 is shown the effect of sugar feeding on the weight loss during
chilling of the hot carcasses. On an average, a lower weight loss appears
in the carcasses from the sugar fed animals. The average difference
was 0.08 %. Statistical analysis showed that this difference was signi-
ficant at P=0.05. The lower shrinkage appears as a consequence
of the higher glycogen content of the meat. In ﬁgure 8 is shown the

NEURAL BASES OF PAIN IN ANIMALS

The study of pain in either man or animals is plagued with many prob-
lems. Most of these problems arise because of difficulties in obtaining a clear,
succinct definition of pain that is acceptable to all concerned with its study.
This difficulty arises because pain is a subjective analysis of central nervous
system activity and, as such, involves a relationship between this activity and
the mind. A discussion of what is meant by the mind will not be attempted in
this exposition for it involves considerations outside the scope of this discus-
sion. Different definitions of mind, however, are many times the basis for dif-
ferences in interpretation of subjective data. We would like to stress the point
that, in a consideration of pain in animals, analogies must be drawn from ex-
periences in man which infer an equality of mind in man and animals. It is in
the degree of truth in this inference that a study of pain in animals has its val—
ue. Lord Brain states (3): "I personally can see no reason for conceding mind
to my fellow men and denying it to animals." If a difference does exist between
the mind of men and that of animals then indeed a difference in the perception
of sensation would be expected to occur, but as Poggio and Mountcastle ex-
plain (19), "There is no 'a priori' reason to suppose that in evolution the per-
ception of pain appears as a wholly new sensory phenomenon in man." From
this we can infer that pain perception does occur in animals and that such a
perception is likened to that which occurs in man. If a stimulus evokes painful
sensations in man, is noxious or potentially noxious to tissues, and provokes
an escape and "emotional response" in an animal, it must be considered to be
a painful stimulus to the conscious animal.

A study of pain mechanisms in animals must involve the use of anatomi-
cal, physiological, and psychological tools to be complete. Anatomical studies
without physiological adjuncts are purely studies of structure upon which no
psychological connotation can be placed. In a similar fashion, psychological
studies without physiological adjuncts are rather meaningless. It is necessary,
therefore, that a study of pain mechanisms involve the coordinated utilization
of anatomico-physiological and physio -psychological approaches. As stated by
Brain (3), "physiology is the essential bridge between anatomy and psychology."
This bridge must not be bypassed in an attempt to approach the study of sen—
sations by way of anatomico—psychological means. Many workers in the past
have attempted such a bypass. Von Frey was one of the first investigators to
introduce an anatomico-psychological categorization of sensations (7). He clas-

in the sides. After this correction the difference in weight gain during
curing is 0.16 % and weight loss during maturation 0.41 %. Statistical
analysis shows that the difference during curing is signiﬁcant at P =0.10
\‘rhile the difference during maturation is signiﬁcant at P =0.001.

The reduced weight loss of bacon from sugar fed pigs appears to be
due to increased binding of moisture. It is thus shown in table 8 that
the salt concentration in the samples of bacon from the fed pigs, on an
average, were lower than the control samples.

The reduced weight loss appears not to be a direct consequence of
open structure of the meat. The open structure should enable the meat
to absorb an increased amount of pickle resulting in a higher salt
content. (Callow (1936).)

The effect of the open structure on absorption of pickle in the meat
may be demonstrated when single muscles or pieces of meat are im-
mersed in a large volume of pickle. To study the effect, ﬁve tenderloins
were selected from among the tenderloins trimmed oil the bacon sides at
the Roskilde Bacon Factory. They were selected so that their pH were
5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8 and 5.9 respectively. The loins were immersed for two
days in a pickle containing 200 g sodium chloride per litre. The salt
content was determined after removal from the pickle. The results are

 




sified sensations into four modalities, each subserved by specific receptors
and fibers. Such a concept implies a fixed relationship between anatomical
structures and psychological experience which is not supported by our pres-
ent knowledge (16).

Through the placement of lesions within the central nervous system of
man and animals either accidentally or experimentally, it has been found that
various portions or all of a pain response could be abolished depending upon
the location and extent of the lesion. From such studies, so-called ”pain-path-
ways" have been demarcated within the central nervous system and it has been
assumed by many that these "pain pathways" are necessary for the normal per-
ception and expression of pain.

It has been demonstrated with reasonable surety by many workers in this
field that functionally specific receptors are found within the skin and that
these receptors are attached to fibers leading into specific channels within the
central nervous system (9,15,28). It has not been demonstrated, however, that
any specific channel within the central nervous system is by itself essential
for the perception of a specific sensory stimulation.

J. M. Schiff in 1854 presented an initial observation that pain perception
in animals might be dependent upon specific fiber tracts within the spinal
cord (21). Following this, many workers have reaffirmed again and again that
pain perception was dependent upon the functional integrity of specific fiber
systems within the spinal cord and brain stem. With this concept was included
the concept of Von Frey that a specific peripheral sensory receptor was acti-
vated by a noxious stimulus which produced activity within a specific central
nervous system pathway which in turn was necessary for the perception of the
event as painful. All of these, which have as their bases anatomico-psycholog-
ical assumptions, are faced with the problem of the absence of physiological
observations concerning what actually occurs within the central nervous sys-
tem between the event of the peripheral stimulus and the activity in the central
nervous system which actually leads to the perception. Such studies, when con—
ducted in man, are of some value for it can be determined subjectively wheth-
er or not a perception occurred and of what nature the perception was. In ani-
mals such studies are very difficult or impossible to interpret for no assur-
ance can be given that a perception did or did not occur under a given condi-
tion. When such an investigation is conducted without the aid of physiological
studies the psychological conclusions drawn are based upon the characteristics
of the stimulus applied, which can be very misleading.

Of the many workers who have approached the problem of the neural basis
for pain in man or animals, only a few have utilized a combination of anatomi-
cal and physiological parameters to ascertain that it is a pain response that is
actually being studied (5,25,26). Fewer still have utilized an approach of apply-
ing anatomico-physiological techniques with correlated physio -psychological
observations to be certain that the anatomical substrates of not only the pain
response, but also pain perception, are being studied.

An examination of the publications in which a more decisive investigation
has been carried out would indicate, however, that the specificity implied by
the earlier anatomical studies is not likely to occur. A good example of these
differences occurs in investigations concerning the sensory innervation to the
face. The trigeminal nerve enters the brain stem and is classically said to di-
vide into an ascending limb and a descending limb. The ascending limb has
been assumed to be concerned with the conduction of impulses associated with
the application of touch or light pressure to the skin or to the movement of
joints, while the descending limb has been associated with the conduction of
impulses elicited by a noxious stimulus or by the application of warmth to the
skin. It has been known since the studies of Cajal that these two systems are
not disassociated from each other anatomically, even though the functional dis-
association has been well accepted by workers in this area. The inference that

given in ﬁg. 9. One notices an increasing salt content with decreasing
pH. The open structure in relation to the pH of the meat apparently
does not play the same role in the curing of Wiltshire sides for the ab—
sorption of pickle. The sides are pumped a standard amount of pickle
and stacked in the tank where the ratio of sides to pickle is about 2 to 1..
Only limited absorption of salt from the pickle appears to take place
in the tank. The open structure of the meat may rather facilitate the
penetration of the pickle into the meat ﬁbres so an increased proportion
of the meat protein get into contact with the sodium chloride. As sodium
chloride is known to increase the water binding capacity of meat
proteins (Hamm (1955)) the reduced weight loss of the bacon from the
fed pigs may to some extent be explained as an indirect effect of the
open structure.

In Madsen’s experiments weight gain during curing and weight
loss' during maturation were also recorded for a certain number of
sides from the sugar fed and starved groups of pigs. The weight gain
was the same for both groups but the weight loss during maturation
was a little higher for the sides from the sugar fed pigs. In Callow’s
experiments with transport and fasting of pigs it was observed that the
sides from fasted pigs shrank less during curing (Callow & Boaz (1938)).
The extra loss in carcass weight due to longer periods of fasting was to
a large extent neutralised by the smaller loss in the pickle—tank. The
smaller loss during pickling was by Callow & Duckham (1938) sug
gested due to an abnormal loss of water from the muscular tissues
during the fasting period. The fasting periods were very long, up to
70 hours, so the results are hardly applicable to the practical conditions
in this country.

In our experiment there was however a loss in carcass weight for
the sugar fed pigs. This weight loss cannot however explain the reduced.
weight loss of the bacon. A preliminary experiment with control pigs
rested at the factory, without food, for the same length of time as the
fed pigs gave also a higher yield of bacon for the fed group. In the
Canadian experiments this aspect of sugar feeding was not mentioned.

Eﬁect of sugar feeding on the cover pickle

In table 6 is given the effect of sugar feeding on the number of bac-
teria in the cover pickle. One notices that the cover pickle used to cure
the meat from the sugar fed pigs had considerably less bacteria than
the control cover pickle. The reason is probably diffusion of lactic acid
from the meat juice into the pickle. The pH was, on the average,




the descending limb of the trigeminal tracts is associated with pain perception
has been irrefutably supported by the numerous accounts of a reduction of pain
perception in man following a transection of this tract within the brain stem.
A recent series of investigations involving an anatomico—physiological ap-
proach to the descending limb of the trigeminal nerve and its nucleus indicates,
however, that few or no neurons or nerve fibers within this nucleus are acti—
vated by a noxious stimulus applied to the skin; instead, most of the neurons
from which recording could be obtained were activated by touch stimuli applied
to the skin (13,14). The conclusion drawn by these workers was that the sensa-
tion of pain is evoked by activity within fine fiber systems and that these fiber
systems can be activated by many types of stimuli, but that it is the total ac-
tivity of the central nervous system that results in a perception of pain or of
any other sensation and not activity within any one pathway or any one nuclear
group. This does not imply that there are not fiber pathways within the central
nervous system which are activated by specific methods of stimulation for, as
stated above, this has been well documented. It does imply, however, that the
final perception depends upon more than mere activity within a pathway or nu-
cleus. In an attempt to rationalize the paradox which apparently exists between
the physiological findings in a study of the trigeminal nucleus and the results
of its surgical transection in relieving pain, Wall and Taub (24) present two in-
teresting possible solutions. One solution they propose is that activity in the
most caudal cells of this nuclear group is not set off by painful stimuli, but
might be a specific prerequisite trigger mechanism for the production of ac-
tivity in other systems. The other solution suggested is that the prerequisite
for the pain perception may be the production of many impulses by many cells
in a particular region of the central nervous system. Pain perception and re-
actions would then be elicited by the massive spatial and temporal summation
of these impulses on cells deeper within the nervous system. If this were the
case, any reduction of the number of afferents would decrease the intensity of
the barrage that leaves the primary nuclei. This reduction could then explain
the results obtained in surgery without jeopardizing the physiological findings.

In light of the above reference to pain perception resulting from a mas-
sive summation of impulses within the nervous system, it seems appropriate
to discuss an intensity theory of pain. Erasmus Darwin thought pain to be the
consequence of any excessive stimulation and a result of exaggeration of sen-
sations of heat, touch, sight, taste, or smell (6). This theory in one modifica—
tion or another has found many supporters. It is well known to each of us that
sensations of every order which in moderate degree are rather pleasant be-
come unpleasant when their intensity grows strong enough (10). Gooddy argues
that (8) "any nervous pathway is potentially a pain pathway," i.e., that any path—
way may provide "the impulse patterns that are associated with the perception
of pain."

The most clear-cut evidence that at least some pain is to be regarded as
a particular form of sensation with its own pathways and not merely an inten-
sification of other forms is provided by patients with a lesion confined to the
anterior quadrant of the spinal cord. This usually deprives them of the capac—
ity to feel pain in response to a wide variety of stimuli which were previously
painful, yet proprioceptive and light touch sensibility are virtually unimpaired.
This is the typical finding after the operation of anterolateral cordotomy. In
the works of Schiff referred to above, the fundamental observation was made
that lesions of the spinal cord in rabbits, sparing only the posterior columns,
resulted in animals which would make a number of responses to touch where-
as they would ignore presumably painful deep stimuli (21). Schiff recognized
the similarity between this state and the clinical condition of analgesia with-
out anesthesia to touch, described in man by Beau and Vieusseux (cited by
Schiff, p. 253). In 1896, Von Frey applied his hair anesthesiometer to the prob—
lem (7a). He found that there were definite points on the skin of maximal sen-

lower in this pickle. For both the pickles the pH was lower after cure
than before, apparently because of the rise in concentration of lactic
acid.

In Madsen’s experiments there was also reported a decrease in pH
of the cover pickle during the curing of the sides from the sugar fed
and starved pigs. No difference was found in pH of the pickles used
for the sides from the sugar fed and the normally fed pigs. By direct
microscopic examination no difference in numbers of bacteria in the
pickles could be demonstrated.

Eﬂect of sugar feeding on the keeping quality

Sugar feeding decreased the number of bacteria on the matured
bacon and thereby improved the keeping quality. In table 7 are given
the number of bacteria on the examined sides. Statistical analysis of
the logarithm to the number of bacteria on the meat surface showed
that the reduction in the number of bacteria was statistically signiﬁcant
at P =0.001. For the rind surface the difference was signiﬁcant at P =
0.05.

The results correspond well to the results of Madsen’s and the
Canadian experiments.

 




 

sitivity to pain, which did not correspond with the positions of the touch-spots,
and by sticking fine cactus thorns on the hairs he could find points on the skin
from which only pain-sensations could be evoked. He concluded that the sen-
sory elements in the skin were the free endings of the fine plexuses of nerve
fibers in the skin. He showed, furthermore, that the actual strength of stimu-
lus required to stimulate a pain-spot was actually less than that required to
stimulate a touch-spot. Subsequently, Cattell and Hoagland in 1931 stimulated
the touch-receptors in a frog's skin by repeated short blasts of air and were
able to evoke sensory discharges at the highest frequency the nerve could car-
ry, yet they did not note any pain-reactions in the animal (4). Even though
these evidences would indicate that it was not the intensity of stimulation at
the periphery that resulted in the activity leading to pain perception, this the-
ory is still supported by some workers. The view that intensity of response
within the central nervous system may have a bearing on pain perception, how-
ever, is a relatively recent proposal. This view is hinted at in the work of
Gooddy referred to above but is presented in a more direct fashion by Bowsher
and Albe-Fessard (2). They suggest that the pain-temperature pathway is sim-
ilar to that postulated for the arousal reaction in the animal. They propose that
two common phenomena are significant in regard to the arousal ability of pain-
ful stimuli. First, a loud and prolonged noise, known physiologically to have a
marked arousal effect, may become subjectively unpleasant or even painful and,
second, that no amount of pure touch or joint movement ever elicits pain. They
point out that this occurs because touch and joint movement receptors have no
connection with the neurological system responsible for arousal; however, au-
ditory systems have a well developed projection into this system.

There is general agreement that arousal is mediated by the ascending re-
ticular system of Moruzzi and Magoun (18), as well as by related structures,
such as the dynamogenic field of Hess in the posterolateral hypothalamus (17).
This system has a diffuse projection upon the cerebral cortex. It is proposed
that the diffuse activation of the whole intact cerebral cortex is necessary for
the conscious appreciation of pain and that any mechanism which will cause
activation of the arousal mechanism to the proper intensity could result in the
perception of pain. This theory is interesting from the standpoint that it in-
volves the ascending reticular formation directly in the perception of pain.
The ascending reticular formation has also been involved in the arousal reac-
tion, with attention responses, and with maintenance of consciousness, all of
which would alter the animal's ability to perceive pain.

Anatomico -physiological studies of pain mechanisms involve the study of
anatomical structures that are involved in the elucidation of a pain response
in the animal. If the study is limited to just the study of responses which are
usually associated with the perception of pain in man, the perception of pain
by the animal need not be considered. Such a study would not then involve the
study of pain as a sensation but would be more likely a study of the reflexology
evoked by a noxious or potentially noxious stimulus. Such a study was conduct—
ed by Woodworth and Sherrington, who termed the responses obtained "pseudo-
affective" reflexes (27). In their investigation they transected the brain stem
at the mesencephalon and thus removed the neural mechanisms which are nec—
essary for the perception of pain, but left intact the pathways which control
the reflex machinery of the nervous system and which give rise to the outward
expression of the sensation in the intact animal. It was found that when a nox-
ious stimulus was applied to the animal the responses obtained were much like
those obtained when the same stimulus was applied to a normal intact animal.
The animal exhibited a withdrawal response, turning of the head toward the
point stimulated; opening of the mouth, retraction of the lips and tongue, move-
ment of the vibrissae, snapping of the jaw; lowering of the head; opening of the
eyelids, dilation of the pupils; vocalization, with a transient rise in arterial
blood pressure. From this it can be seen that not only does the animal exhibit

Organoleptic examination of the bacon

Sugar feeding did not improve ﬂavour, texture or colour of the fried
bacon. In table 8 are shown the average marks for the samples exami—
ned. On the average, bacon from the control pigs was rated higher than
bacon from the sugar fed pigs. Statistical analysis of the differences
between the two groups of bacon showed no statistical signiﬁcance for
any of the rated qualities.

In Madsen’s experiments a few samples were examined as fried
bacon. Generally the samples from the sugar fed pigs were considered
best.

Colour and colour stability of the bacon in the cooked condition
were examined. Sugar feeding appeared to have made the meat paler in
colour than usual, but improved the colour stability a little bit (table 9).

many of the behavioral responses which are usually associated with the sen-
sation of pain in man, but also exhibits some components of the emotional re-
sponse which accompanies pain in man, even though in such a preparation it

is hardly conceivable that any emotion could be experienced or pain perceived
by the animal. We must not assume, therefore, that because an animal reacts
in this fashion to a noxious stimulus that it necessarily consciously perceives
pain. The anatomical arrangement is such that it can react at what might be
called subconscious levels (2). Studies of this sort are of value in delineating
the reflexology of the pain response, but it must not be inferred that these
same pathways are necessary for pain perception. Care must be taken in inter-
pretation of motor activity alone, with no other "perceptual" parameters of
measurement with which we can differentiate purely reflex motor activity from
"perception-linked" motor activity (12). Such ”perception-linked" motor activ-
ity can be assured through the utilization of physio ~psychologica1 studies.

The hypothesis presented by Bowsher and Albe-Fessard (2), as well as
many other experiments, indicate that the cerebral cortex and ascending retic-
ular formation are necessary for the perception of pain in man and animals.

A concept developed by River and Head would indicate that an awareness of
discomfort resulting from a noxious stimulus might occur in a thalamic ani-
mal, i.e., an animal with the cerebral cortex removed. These workers agree,
however, that such discomfort probably would not be appreciated as pain by
the individual (20). Bowsher and Albe-Fessard state (2), "the integrity of the
cerebral cortex is necessary for the conscious appreciation of sensation; no
cortex, no consciousness. Conversely, peripherally generated impulses which
fail to reach the cerebral cortex do not evoke conscious sensation."

With this in mind, if an investigation of pain is based on the fact that the
responses monitored are dependent upon the integrity and function of the cer—
ebral cortex and the ascending reticular formation, we can be certain that the
animal is in a state to perceive pain. We can, therefore, be more certain that
the responses are linked with the perception of pain and are not merely reflex
or "pseudo-affective” in nature. In addition, if we can utilize a normally "non-
painful" stimulus and in some way cause it to be painful to the animal we can
be assured that reflexes or "pseudo-affective" responses would not be a prob—
lem. Through the use of conditioned responses both of these requirements may
be fulfilled. The suggestion that, in conditioned responses, such a change in
perceptive quality of various stimuli occurs was presented by I. M. Sechenov,
who writes as follows (22): "From the point of view of the phenomena which
take place in the central nervous system, it is immaterial whether I actually
see a man before me or merely remember him. The first stimulus that brings
him back to my memory is generally the action upon me, at a given moment,
of one of the external stimuli which were acting upon me at the time of my
first encounter with that man. This stimulus calls forth all the complex of sen-
sations which was produced in me by this man and which is preserved in my
central nervous system in the form of traces. I see a man because his image
is actually pictured on my retina; I remember him because my eye has caught
the image of the door near which he stood." This statement of experiences by
Sechenov indicates a phenomenon familiar to each of us each time we remem—
ber some event or experience of our past. If we can, therefore, produce in an
animal a memory of events leading to a painful stimulus we are able to cause
the animal to recall the painful stimulus whether the stimulus is actually pre-
sented or not. This is accomplished by coupling a non-painful stimulus, such
as a series of clicks, with a painful stimulus so that each time the non-painful
stimulus is presented it is followed by the painful event. After a number of
pairings, the non-painful stimulus will take on the perceptual qualities of the
painful stimulus and will be accompanied by the behavior that would result
from a perception of pain. In this manner an artificial pain perception can be
created with a concomitant pain response, both of which are indistinguishable

Fig. 10. Colour marks in canned hams from the 7th week plotted against pH.

Statistical analysis showed that no significance could be given these
differences. Neither Madsen’s nor Gibbons and Rose’s papers gave
results of colour ratings in cooked cured bacon. Only on the whole
‘Niltshire sides and the raw domestic cured hams was the colour eva-
luated. In both cases meat fromthe sugar fed pigs had the best colour.
Postma (1932) noted a correlation between colour and pH of fresh
meat, low pH being connected to pale colour of the meat.

The paler colour of the cooked bacon from the sugar fed pigs can
be correlated with the pH of the cooked meat. In ﬁg. 10 are shown the
colour marks of the meat in 10 canned hams from the 7th week, in
relation to pH. A close correlation is apparent. In the colour rating a
scale having 6 as maximum was applied. ‘

The general results of the examinations of the canned hams are given
in table 10. Colour and texture of the meat were generally inferior in
the hams from the sugar fed pigs. The amount of jelly in the can was
higher in the case of the hams from the sugar fed pigs than in the case
of the control hams. Apparently the tendency towards improved water
binding capacity of the meat from the sugar fed pigs was conﬁned only
to the raw state.

 




from the initial pain perception and response. With this type of experimental
design, however, no pain response will occur unless there is a concomitant
perception of pain and thus we can be assured that all responses being stud-
ied are linked with the perception of pain and are indicators of this perception
and are not merely reflexes with no perceptual basis.

In order to utilize this approach for the study of pain in animals, it is nec-
essary at the outset to stabilize the animal in its environment so that "emo-
tional responses” which are not associated with pain perception and which are
easily confused with pain responses are not interfering with the interpretation
of the animal's reactions to a stimulus. This is accomplished by a procedure
known as habituation. In this procedure the animal is placed in the environ-
ment where it will be studied for pain perception and it is presented with the
non-painful stimulus, i.e., a flashing light or a series of clicks, until the stimr
ulus produces no response in the animal. Initially this stimulus will cause the
animal to be aroused and evidence of an emotional response can usually be re-
corded. The alerting and emotional response can be detected by changes in the
electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiration.
When, after several presentations of this stimulus, the animal shows no re-
sponse it is assumed that the environment and the stimulus have no signifi—
cance to the animal and that the animal is habituated to the situation. After
such an habituation, conditioning studies can be initiated.

If a painful stimulus is presented to an animal it is found that habituation
does not occur. The painful stimulus will cause the animal to attempt to avoid
the stimulus, to exhibit an emotional response each time the stimulus is given
with no decrement in the intensity of the response. If, however, the painful
stimulus is preceded by the above non-painful stimulus, the non-painful stim-
ulus will in effect cue the animal that the painful stimulus is about to be ap-
plied. Under these conditions the avoidance and the emotional response will
increase in intensity during the first few applications and, after a sufficient
number of pairings, these responses will occur before the painful stimulus is
applied or even when the painful stimulus is not applied at all. When the ani-
mal will repeatedly give the avoidance and emotional responses to the presen-
tation of the non -painful stimulus presented alone, the animal is considered to
be conditioned. In this animal the originally non -painful stimulus has taken on
new characteristics. This stimulus, which before the beginning of the condi-
tioning procedure produced no detectable response in the animal, will now
cause the animal to give a response in all ways identical to that produced by
the presentation of a painful stimulus (Figure 1). For reasons given above it
appears that the perceptive qualities of the stimulus have also changed. We
feel that this stimulus, which after the animal is habituated carries no partic-
ular significance, now has the perceptual qualities of a painful stimulus. We
have, by using a stimulus not usually painful, created an artificial pain percep—
tion within the animal which is identical with the perception of a stimulus that
is actually or potentially noxious to tissue. In accomplishing this end, we have
created a situation which is painful to the animal and which depends upon the
integrity and function of the cerebral cortex and ascending reticular formation
for its elicitation, and can be assured that we are not dealing with a "pseudo-
affective" response. There is much controversy in the literature involving the
role of various parts of the central nervous system in the elaboration of vari—
ous components of the conditioned emotional or avoidance responses. It has
been demonstrated that it is possible to elaborate primitive skeletal-motor
and diverse autonomic conditioned reflexes in experiments utilizing higher
fishes, reptiles, and birds, i.e., animals practically devoid of the cerebral cor—
tex, as well as in rodents with the cerebral cortex removed by a surgical oper—
ation (11). The question still remains, however, whether the various subcortical
structures are capable of elaborating even the most primitive conditioned re—
flexes. An avoidance response developed within a decerebrate animal is not a

Conclusion

iVIost of the results of this experiment are well in line with previous
experiments on the effect of sugar feeding of pigs on the quality of the
meat. '

The most conspicuous effects of the feeding were an increased yield
of bacon during cure and maturation and an improved keeping quality
of the bacon sides.

safe, therefore, in our assumption that a conditioned response, that does not
diminish with time and which is presented as a complete response, is depend-

dicate a pain response in a conditioned animal. It is seen that
the animal gives a response to the clicks, before the shock

is given, that is identical to a response to a painful stimulus.

We have utilized these principles in our investigation of electrical stun—
ning as a humane slaughter procedure. In this study sheep are used as experi-
mental animals (Figure 2). Prior to experimentation each animal is surgically
prepared for recording of electrocorticograms and blood pressure. The elec—
trocorticogram is recorded by means of an implanted octopus—type multiple
electrode which carries six recording leads and one indifferent lead. All re—
cording leads and the indifferent lead are attached to a miniature radio socket
which has been molded into an acrylite base. The electrode is attached to the
skull and each recording lead is placed through small holes in the skull to rest
on the dura covering the frontal, parietal, and occipital portions of the brain.
The indifferent lead is placed in the bone over the nasal cavity. Also attached
to the acrylite electrode base are two screened grids which are placed under
the periosteum of the parietal bones of the skull. These grids are used later
for either stunning the animal or for the delivering of a painful stimulus to the
animal. Blood pressure is recorded by means of a polyethylene catheter sur—
gically implanted in the common carotid artery. Other recording devices are
attached to the animal at the beginning of each experimental session and de-
tached at the end (Figure 3). The electrocardiogram is recorded by means of
two clip leads attached to the animal's fore limb. Respiration rate and pattern
is recorded by measuring the distention of a bellows fastened around the tho-

The nitrite content of the canned hams

The nitrite content of the canned hams decreased with decreasing
pH. In tables 9 and 10 it appears that the nitrite content is considerably
less in the meat from the fed pigs than in the meat from the control
pigs. The coefﬁcient of correlation between the pH and nitrite content
is calculated to be 0.817. The correlation is statistically signiﬁcant at
P =0.001. Gibbons & Rose also found a lower nitrite content in the hams
from sugar fed pigs and a high positive correlation between pH and
nitrite content.

displacement transducer attached to the limb. In some cases the painful stim-
ulus is applied to a rear limb. In this case two stimulating electrodes are at—
tached to the limb for the application of an electrical shock.

At the beginning of each experimental series the animal is habituated to
the experimental environment and to a non-painful stimulus (clicks) so that
when the animal is placed in this environment and presented with the clicks,
no signs of emotional response are recorded. This assures us that changes
observed in the recordings during the progress of the experiment are due to
events other than the control environment and that the clicks are not of sig-
nificance to the animal.

In outlining the experimental procedure we have asked ourselves three
major questions: (1) Does electrical stunning render the animal unconscious?
(2) If so, what is the duration of this unconsciousness? (3) Is electrical stun—
ning a humane procedure, i.e., is it a painful experience for the animal? In
answering these three questions we need to recall the physiological require—
ments for producing a conditioned response. Of utmost importance is that, in
order to give a complete conditioned response, the animal must be conscious ;
(have a functional ascending reticular activating system and cerebral cortex)

(Figure 4). The non-painful stimulus must be perceived by the animal and as—
sociated with the painful stimulus. A second requirement of considerable im-
portance is that the so-called painful stimulus must be actually painful. If it
is not painful, but only elicits reflex activity which may appear to be a pain
response, the animal will not become conditioned to it, but instead will be-
come habituated as to any non—painful stimulus.

In order to determine whether or not electrical stunning renders the ani-
mal unconscious we have conducted a series of experiments in which the ani-
mal was conditioned using clicks followed by application of a painful stimulus
to the rear limb. After conditioning, these animals responded to a previously
non-painful stimulus (clicks) in exactly the same fashion as they responded to
a painful electrical shock to the rear limb. Following conditioning, the animals

Some Observations on the Quality of Cured Bacon
in Relation to Ante-Mortem Treatment
ll. Relationship between carbohydrate metabolites and
curing yield
By J. WISMER—PEDERSEN

Danish Meat Research Institute, Roskilde, Denmark

 

It was previously observed that the bacOn of sugar fed pigs had a
higher increase in weight during cure and a lower shrinkage during
maturation than average in the bacon cure.

The meat from the sugar fed pigs has a generally lower pH after
rigor than the meat from pigs slaughtered right after delivery to the
factory.

From an elementary point of View one should think that the water
holding capacity of the meat would be lower at low pH after rigor.
Low pH in the physiological range would be close to the isoelectrical
point of the meat which is about 5.3—5.4.

Addition of small amounts of lactic acid to the pickle tends to give
higher weight loss during bacon curing (Slagteriernes Laboratorium).
As the meat from sugar fed pigs contained more lactic acid than the
meat from the control animals, one should expect more weight loss.

In ﬁgure 1, all the cured bacon sides in the Kolding experiment are
grouped in accordance with the pH measurements in the gammon.
The respective weight losses during maturation are marked in relation
to pH. The resulting ﬁgure shows that the weight losses of the sides
from the sugar fed pigs consistently are the lowest. The weight loss has
a tendency to rise with decreasing pH apart from the group of pH 5.8.
With the sides of the control animals no relationship between weight
loss and pH could be demonstrated.

These observations suggest that the water is bound more ﬁrmly in
the sides from the fed animals. The effect of the isoelectrical point is
clearly visible in the tendency of the weight losses to increase with de-
creasing pH. The increase in weight loss in the groups with pH 5.8 may

sponse is obtained.

were stunned by means of a commercial stunner attached to the screened grids
implanted with the electrocorticogram electrode carrier. If the stunning cur-
rent rendered the animal unconscious, the conditioned response was lost. As
consciousness was regained the various components of the conditioned response
returned and in this way the duration of unconsciousness was determined. With
this procedure we have found that if the electrical stunning current was of suf-
ficient magnitude and was correctly applied it would render the animal uncon—
scious for a period varying from 3 to 10 minutes depending upon the current
strength.

To determine whether or not electrical stunning is a humane procedure
or if it is a painful experience to the animal, a series of experiments were con-
ducted in which attempts were made to condition the animal to the stunning. As
discussed above, if the stunning is a painful stimulus the animal should be-
come conditioned to it just as it would to any other painful stimulus. If, how-
ever, the electrical stunning is not a painful event the animal should become
habituated to it, just as it would to any other non-painful stimulus. In this ex-
perimental series we have found that if the stunning current was not of suffi-
cient magnitude to render the animal unconscious as determined by the proce-
dure outlined above, it was perceived as a painful stimulus by the animal and
conditioning does occur. If, however, the stunning current was of a magnitude
which rendered the animal unconscious for a period of at least 3 minutes it ap-
parently was not a painful stimulus to the animal as conditioning did not occur.

be connected with a change from >>open>> to >>close>> structure (Callow
1938).
The difference in the water holding capacity of the bacon between the

sugar fed group. and the control group may be due to accumulation of

other carbohydrate metabolites than lactic acid. Other compounds
which possibly could accumulate are citrates and hexose phosphates.

That some differences exist in the relationship between pH and lactic
acid content of the meat in rigor connected to the ante mortem treat—-
ment of the pigs was noted by Bate—Smith (1948).

From corresponding values of pH and lactic acid content the pH
of the muscle with nil lactic acid was calculated. In starved pigs the
mean value was found to be 7.45, in normal fed pigs 7.60. Working
with rats this “basal” pH was found to vary with the amount of exer-
cise the animal was exposed to before killing.

Possible effect of citric acid cycle components

Hamm (1956a & b) has suggested that citrates and other compounds
capable of binding calcium improve the water binding capacity of the
meat. Wierbicki, Cahill & Deatherage (1957), however, found that




In gaining an answer to our third question concerning whether or not elec-
trical stunning is a painful stimulus to the animal, another question arose. In
the instance in which the animal receives an electrical stunning current which
is sufficient to produce unconsciousness, as measured by our criteria, do our
findings indicate that the stimulus is actually a non-painful stimulus or are we
dealing with a retrograde amnesia produced by the electrical stunning current?
If we recall that the animal must perceive the non-painful stimulus (clicks) and
make an association between it and the painful stimulus (shock) it is easy to
see that if a retrograde amnesia is produced by the electrical stunning then
conditioning would not occur because the animal is not able to make the neces-
sary association between the two events.

In an attempt to resolve this latter question we have conducted a series
of experiments according to the following paradigm. The animals were present-
ed a series of clicks as a non—painful stimulus. At the termination of the clicks
or during the last 1/2 second of the presentation of the clicks a shock of low
magnitude was applied as a painful stimulus. Following an interval of one min-
ute after the termination of the clicks and the shock, the animal was electrical-
ly stunned with a current magnitude sufficient to produce unconsciousness. In
these animals conditioning to the shock, which in all other instances never
failed to produce a conditioned response, did not occur. It is apparent, there-
fore, that we are dealing with a retrograde amnesia. If this is true, how does
it influence our previous findings? Does electrical stunning truly produce un—
consciousness, and a state of analgesia, or are all of the findings which we
have obtained brought about by the state of retrograde amnesia? We feel that
the production of a retrograde amnesia by the stunning current serves only to
reaffirm our previous conclusions and that it is not at all incompatible with
our findings. This conclusion is based upon the knowledge that, in order to pro~
duce a retrograde amnesia, a profound alteration in the state of consciousness
is required. Our previous findings indicate that such an alteration does in fact
occur and that in such an altered state of consciousness the animal is unable
to perceive pain.

SUMMARY AND CONC LUSIONS

 

1. Conditioning procedures are useful in the study of pain perception in
animals.

2. Electrical stunning, using sufficient intensity of current, results in the
animals being unable to perceive pain for 3-10 minutes.

3. Electrical stunning in itself is not painful to the animal.

4. Electrical stunning if of sufficient intensity produces a retrograde am-
nesia of events occurring within one minute of the stunning procedure.

ANTE-MORTEM TREATMENT AND THE QUALITY OF CURED BACON. II 93

citric acid increased shrinkage when added to meat prior to heating.
Citrates and related compounds are important compounds in the meta-
bolism of carbohydrates in the meat. It could therefore by possible
that there were differences in the accumulation of these compounds in
the meat between the fed and fasted pigs.

In order to investigate this point, glycogen, lactic acid and citric acid
was determined i m. gracilis of 20 hams, 10 from sugar fed pigs, 10
from pigs fasted 18—20 hours before slaughter.

Material and Methods

Early the day before slaughter should take place 20 pigs were selected
from those delivered to the Roskilde Bacon Factory. The pigs were
selected so that the differences in breed and feeding should be as little
as possible. The pigs from the same producer were divided equally into
two groups until each group had 10 pigs. The pigs in group 1 were kept
in a pen at the factory until the next day without feed but got water ad
libitum. The pigs in group 2 were kept in the same way and fed liberal
amounts of barley. The last feeding took place 3 hours before slaughter
and consisted of 1 kg. sugar mixed with %kg. barley per pig. The pigs
were slaughtered after electrical stunning.

After slaughter, the pH, and content of glycogen, lactic acid and
citric acid were determined. The first determination was made gto 1
hour after slaughter and the second 2 days after slaughter. In the period
between the determinations the meat was kept in a chilling room. One
ham from each pig was cured as bacon. The amount of pump pickle
used was 8 % of the weight of the meat. The pickle had a strength of
170 B and contained 1 g. of sodium nitrite per litre. After 4 days in the
"tank the hams were removed from the cure and the third determination
was made. The fourth determination was made after 8 days of matura—
tion.

Methods of Analysis

The determinations were made in the part of m. gracilis uncovered
by cutting off the ham. The pH was determined directly in the meat at
the ﬁrst determination. In the following determinations the maceration
method was used. Lactic acid was determined after Barker & Summer-
son (1941). Citric acid was determined by means of reaction with acetic
acid anhydride and pyridine (Snell & Snell, 1953). By this method the
content of aconitic acid and a considerable part ofthe content of itaconic

and isocitric acid in the meat are included in the analytical results.
The results of analysis may thus be taken as representative of the com
tent of the higher acids of the citric acid cycle in the meat.

Results and Discussion

The results of the determinations are given in tables 1, 2, and 3.

The determination just after slaughter

The lactic acid content and'the pH was approximately the same in
the meat from the fed and fasted animals. The meat from the fed pigs
had a considerably higher glycogen content. The citric acid content
was highest in the meat from the fasted animals.

The determination after two days9 hanging

After two days the post-mortem conversion of glycogen to lactic acid
should be completed. The pH of the meat has decreased and the lactic.
acid content increased in the meat from both groups of pigs. The high
content of glycogen in the meat from the fed animals has resulted in
lower pH (on the average 5.4) and higher lactic acid content compared
to the meat from the fasted animals. In the meat from both groups
there are, however, still residual glycogen, on the average 0.20 % and
0.10 %, respectively, in the meat of fed and fasted pigs. For both groups
it amounts to 22—23 % of the glycogen content measured at the ﬁrst
determination.

Working with beef, Howard and Lawrie (1956) found up to 0.15 %

ANTE-MORTEM TREATMENT AND THE QUALITY OF CURED BACON. II 99

Methods of Analysis

The determinations of pH, glycogen and lactic acid were made as in
the preceding experiments. The lactic acid and reducing sugars were
determined in a trichloroacetic acid extract of the meat. Reducing sugars
were determined in accordance with Hagedorn et a1. (1946).

Results and Discussion

In table 4 are listed the results of the determinations of pH, glycogen,
lactic acid and reducing sugars. It appears that the greatest difference
in the composition of the meat between the fed and fasted group lies
in the content of reducing sugars and glycogen.

After curing of the tenderloins the glycogen in the meat from the fed
pigs is broken down so only an insigniﬁcant amount remain. The major
difference in the composition of the meat between the groups is now
solely the content of reducing sugars (tables 5 and 6).

It is tempting to assume that the hexose phosphates in themselves
impart an improved water binding capacity on the meat. An indication

ANTE~MORTEM TREATMENT AND THE QUALITY OF CURED BACON. II 101

The possible effect of the sugar on the water holding capacity appears
iikcly to be of an osmotic nature. It is thus shown in the 1st part that the
improved water holding capacity of the bacon from the sugar fed pigs
is conﬁned to the raw, undenatured state of the meat.

Conclusion

The reduced weight lossed during curing and maturation of bacon
from sugar fed pigs appear to be connected with the accumulation of
reducing sugars in the meat.

Some Observations on the Quality of Cured Bacon

III. Effects on the colour of cured hams

By J. WISMER-PEDERSEN

Danish Meat Research Institute, Roskilde, Denmark

 

The colour of cured bacon depends partly on the concentration of
the red pigment nitroso myoglobin and partly on the optical properties
of the meat ﬁbres.

The formation and stability of nitroso myoglobin is likely to be
dependent on pH in the pH range normally found in cured bacon. The
colour formation seems to be most favourable at low pH. Duisberg &
Miller (1943) suggest that the colour formation is best in the pH range
of 5.2 to 6.0. Madsen (1942) and Gibbons & Rose (1950) found best
colour in cured bacon and hams having low pH. Winkler, Hopkins and
Thistle (1940) found a slight but signiﬁcant correlation between pH
of the meat and the intensity of reﬂectance in the blue region. The
reﬂectance in this region is probably due to metmyoglobin, that is, the
oxidised part of the native pigment myoglobin which is not converted
to nitroso myoglobin. There are rather conﬂicting statements in the
literature on colour stability. Gibbons & Rose (1950) found that the
colour of bacon was much more stable at pH values below 5.8. Above
this value the stability was poor. In solutions of nitroso myoglobin the
stability of the pigment decreases with decreasing pH (Urbain & Jensen,
1940 and Walsh & Rose, 1956).

The colour impression of the meat surface is, however, also dependent
on the transparency of the meat ﬁbres as already mentioned in part I.
In part I a considerable decline in colour of fried and cooked samples
was noted when the pH approached the isoelectrical point of the meat.
This effect probably is due to less transparency of the meat mainly
because of coagulation.

This effect of pH is most pronounced in canned hams. The hams are
heat processed as gently as possible at a temperature of (SO—70°C. so
that the proteins are only partly coagulated by the heat treatment. The

Introduction

The quality of pork is very sensitive to variations in the feedstuﬂ'
used for the pigs and the ante-mortem treatment given them. Pigs are
fatigued far more easily than other meat producing animals such as
cattle, sheep, or horses (Bate—Smith 1938, 1939 and 1948). Fatigue and
exhaustion immediately before slaughter has been known for a long
time to be detrimental to the quality of the meat.

As early as 1720 Daniel Defoe wrote in his novel “King of Pirates”
about the importance of avoiding chasing cattle before killing in order
to get well cured beef. As far as pork is concerned, Callow (1936)
appears to be the ﬁrst to study the effect of ante—mortem treatment
of the pig on the quality of cured pork. His interest in this matter
was aroused in 1935. At that time it was noted in Northern Ireland
that there was a striking difference in the incidence of taint in dry-
salt cured hams between farm killed pigs and pigs killed in abattoirs
or factories. Farm killed pigs gave only 5 per cent slightly tainted hams
whereas with pigs killed in abattoirs the proportion of tained hams
shot up to 50 per cent. Moreover, the degree of tainting was intensiﬁed.
Callow showed that the electrical resistance in the meat 24 hours
after slaughter was much lower in farm killed pigs than when the pigs
were killed in the factory.

Further studies (Callow, 1937, ’1938 and 1939) revealed that the
physiological condition of the animal at the time of slaughter was
important. When the pig was slaughtered at the farm it was usually
rested and the muscles had a high glycogen content. After killing, the
glycogen was converted to lactic acid and the meat would acquire a

 




 

 

ANTE-MORTEM TREATMENT AND THE QUALITY OF CURED BACON. III 103

amount ofjelly cooked out is only a fraction of what it would be if the

hams were cooked to full coagulation of the proteins.
When proteins coagulate they become opaque. The tendency to

coagulation increases the closer pH is to the isoelectrical point (Putnam,
1953). The canned ham will thus apparently be more opaque the closer
pH is to the isoelectrical point which is about 5.3—5.4.

Addition of polyphosphates to the pump pickle reduces the amount
of cook out jelly in canned hams and gives an improved colour to the
ﬁnished product. The effect is probably due to improvement in the
water binding capacity of the meat and possibly to reduction of the
tendency to coagulation during the heat treatment. Addition of 1%
sodium polyphosphate generally rises the cloud point of myosin
solutions.

In order to study the effect of ante-mortem treatment and the addition
of polyphosphates to the pickle on the colour and colour stability of
canned hams, an experiment was carried out with hams from sugar
fed pigs and from fasted pigs. In the experiment the content of nitroso
myoglobin in the meat was measured. The hams were the same as those
used to study the possible effects of citrates in the meat. The ante-mortem
treatment and procedure of slaughter is given in part II. The treatment
of the hams during curing and analysis will be explained here.

Material and Methods

After chilling, i.c. 20—24 hours after slaughter, the right hand hams
were cut off the carcasses. The hams were cured at the Institute. The
hams were divided into two groups each containing the same number of
hams from fed and fasted pigs. The pH was measured in m. biceps
femoris and m. gracilis—adductor. The hams in group 1 were pumped
with a pickle of 170 B containing 50 g. sodium tripolyphosphate and
1 g. sodium nitrite per litre. Group 2 was pumped with a pickle of the
same strength and nitrite content but without phosphate. The hams were
cured for four days in separate tanks but with the same cover pickle.
After curing the hams were matured for ten days. The hams were sent
to the Danish cooperative meat canning plant (DAK) for processing to
canned hams. The quality of the canned hams was evaluated at the
Institute. It comprised an organoleptic examination in 4 sections so 5
random selected hams were judged at each section. Furthermore, the
amount ofjelly in the can, the pH in m. biceps femoris and m. gracilis-
adductor and the salt content were measured. The nitrite and nitroso
myochromogen contents were determined.

low pH and an open structure with low electrical resistance. Transport
of the pigs from the farm to the abattoir usually caused fatigue and they
would arrive with low glycogen contents. The low glycogen content
resulted in a low lactic acid content in the meat which would have a
high pH and electrical resistance.

Resting of the pigs at the abattoir prior to slaughter was suggested
to increase the glycogen content of the muscles. As glycogen deposits
slowly, or perhaps not at all, in the muscles during rest, Bate—Smith
(1938 a) suggested feeding an easily digestible carbohydrate during the
resting period to help the glycogen depositing. Experiments confirmed
that feeding was essential for a good result from rest. Callow, Ingram
& Hawthorne (1949) found that rest without feeding had only little
effect on the pH of the meat after slaughter. Rose & Peterson (1951)
found that recovery of muscle carbohydrate reserves of starved. hogs
occurred in about eight hours following feeding of a high sugar food.

The suggestion to feed the pigs an easily digestible carbohydratie,
as sugar, during the resting period at the abattoir was explored by Danish
researchers and a number of experiments were carried out (Madsen,
1942).

The pigs were mainly fed individually in separate pens until slaughter.
The feed contained up to 3 kg. sugar a day. The effect on meat quality
was particularly remarkable after curing. The cured bacon was far
less perishable and had improved colour and appearance. {in the
whole, the taste was judged to be more aromatic and full-bodied. Sides
from pigs fasted the last day and night before slaughter were used as
controls in these experiments. Fasting the pigs the day before slaughter
was common practice among the farmers at that time.

Canadian experiments (Gibbons & Rose, 1950) found that rest and
feeding 3 lbs. of sugar during the last day before slaughter gave pork
with a low and uniform pH. After curing, the meat had improved colour
and keeping quality. While Callow (1938a) found that salt better
penetrated meat from rested animals because of the open structure,
the Canadians could not ﬁnd evidence for this claim.

The Danish experiments were made on the threshold of World \Var
II. Shortage of supplies prevented practical application of the results
at the bacon factories. After the war sugar feeding of pigs rested over-
night at the factory has been carried out in a few places.

In the endeavour to improve the quality of bacon it is a point 0f
considerable interest and the study of the usefulness of the treatment
under Danish conditions has been continued.

The experiments have been focused on cured VViltshire bacon, the

Methods of Analysis

The determination of the content of nitroso myochromogen, than-
denatured form of nitroso myoglobin was made by extraction with
80 % acetone and comparison of the colour intensity of the extract 1
540 my. wavelength with that of a known concentration. By extractim‘i
of cooked cured meat with 80 % acetone-water mixture, the content of
nitroso myochromogen is extracted as the acetone complex of nitrose
haem. The metmyochromogen in the meat gives only a small amourai
of haematin in the extract. The absorption of the haematin at 540 mfg.
is less than 2 % of the absorption of nitroso haem acetone complex;
(Hornsey, 1956).

main product of the Danish meat industry. In addition, the quality of
canned hams has been studied.

In the following the general results of a sugar feeding experiment will
be given. In later sections the effect of feeding on the water holding
capacity of the meat and on meat colour will be discussed in more detail.

Experimental

Although unavoidable, errors of such magnitude are very easily
introduced during the conduct of experiments during normal operations
in bacon factories that the effect under study is often largely obscured.
It is so in particular if the experiment is confined to one day. In order
to study details during production, experiments should preferably be
designed as replicas over an extended period.

An experiment to study the effect of rest and feeding the pigs at the
factory was carried out during a period of 8 weeks, from May to July
1956. The experiment was organized as a single week experiment
with 7 replicas. Each week the pork from 10 pigs was cured as Wilt—
shire bacon in a little experimental stainless steel tank. The same
cover pickle was used during the whole experiment. During the course
of curing, compounds such as lactic acid, citric acid, and sugars may
diffuse out of the meat into the pickle. The amount of material entering
the pickle may be different when it is pork from sugar fed pigs or
starved pigs.

The pigs were received at the factory during the afternoon and were
fed and rested before being slaughtered the next morning between 8
and 9 am. The sides from these pigs were cured along with sides from
pigs killed immediately after arrival at the bacon factory. The latter
are termed “control pigs” in the following.

Methods of Analysis

Determination of liver weight. The livers were weighed at the same
time as the veterinary inspection of the plucks took place. Apart from
the state of feeding, the weight of liver depends on the age and size ofthe
animal. In order to evaluate the effect of ante-mortem treatment, one
must express the weight as percentage of the carcass weight. In this
experiment this percentage is termed liver percent. The weight of the
warm dressed carcass just before chilling is used as carcass weight.
The carcasses were cleaned and freed of plucks and leaf fat. The effect
of age on the liver percent cannot be adjusted at the factories because

second day after slaughter the pH was considerably lower in the meat
from the fed pigs. One notices that the pH of the meat generally was
lower the second day after slaughter compared to the ﬁrst day. This
observation shows that the glycolysis takes more than one day for com—
pletion.

After curing, the pH was a little higher than before curing. The
addition of polyphosphate had resulted in a higher pH of the meat. The
effect was most pronounced in the hams from the fed pigs.

Colour evaluation in the hams

As in the foregoing experiments the hams from the fed pigs appeared
paler in colour than the hams from the fasted pigs (Table 2). In the
hams cured with phosphates no difference in meat colour could be
found between the hams from the fed and fasted pigs. While addition
of polyphosphate did not improve the colour of the hams from the fasted
pigs, a pronounced improvement was found for the hams from the fed
pigs. The improvement was statistically signiﬁcant at P=0.05. The
improvement was possibly connected to the considerable increase of
pH caused by the addition of polyphosphate. The pH of the hams from
the fasted pigs was only negligibly altered by the polyphosphate.

the age is unknown. With the simplifying assumption that the age of
the pigs was proportional to their weight, a correlation between <1
percent and carcass weight for a number of pigs slaughtered at the

Kolding Bacon Factory (Andels- Svineslagteri) was worked out. Ht
results are given in ﬁgure 1. The coefﬁcient of correlation was ——-w:',>.i¥f<i}6
which is statistically signiﬁcant at P =O.10. The coefﬁcient of 170g2,“0§-1‘~li{ m

was ——0.021, that is, the liver percent decreased 0.021 when the (1%,
weight became 1 kg. heavier in the weight interval studied—rm.mass
weight between 60 and 72 kg. Considerable variation in the liver grim—sweat
within the groups receiving the same ante-mortem treatment zrerui<t
not, however, be adjusted by means of this regression. The co'rrssriium
appears, therefore, not very helpful in improving the value or?" the
information that can be derived from the liver percentage.
Determination opr in the meat. The pH measurements in the meat
took place 20—24 hours after killing immediately before the ‘areasses
were trimmed and cured. The meaurements were made electrometrieally
with a glass electrode and a calomel reference electrode placed directly
in the meat. This method of pH measurement has been used by Callow
(1949), Gibbons & Rose (1950) and Ostertag & Schonberg (1955).
For the measurements the Radiometer pH meters 22 and 24 were used.
The measurements were taken in the tenderloin and m. gracilis-ad—
ductor. The electrodes were placed in the muscles in exactly the same
way at each measurement to ensure reproducibility. M. gracilis—ad-
ductor was chosen because it is comparatively easy to obtain reproducible
results in this muscle and it is accessible to measurement without in—
juring the side. Experiments have shown that there is .a high correlation
’=0.001 between the pH of 1n. longissimus dorsi and the pH of m.

The colour stability judged by inspection was inferior in the meat
from the fed pigs. Addition of phosphate did not improve the stability.
After exposure to light for three hours the colour of the meat from the
fasted animals was the best and no effect of polyphosphate could be
detected.

gracilis-adductor (Blomquist). The muscle is not very sensitive to the
cll‘ect of fatigue. The tenderloin is more sensitive and this muscle has
therefore been included as representative of a sensitive muscle. Some
measurements were also taken in m. biceps femoris.

Organoleptic evaluation of the cured bacon. The effect of ante-mortem
treatment on the colour, taste and texture of the cured bacon was
evaluated organoleptically by an analytical taste panel. The panel
consisted of 4 members with more than 2 years experience in tasting
bacon. The tasters assigned marks to the samples using a scale of 10
marks. The mark 10 denoted excellent and the mark 0 absolutely
inedible. The marks between reﬂected proportional decline of quality.
Sometimes in the examination of the canned hams a scale from (3 to 0
was applied where 6 means excellent and 0 inedible.

Colour evaluation was made after 0 and 3 hours illumination. The
source of light was a battery of ﬂuorescent lamps. Phillips model
40W/33. The samples were placed at a distance of 79 cm. from the
lamps. Colour stability was calculated on the basis of the colour loss
during illumination.

Determination of the nitrite content. The nitrite content of the meat
and pickle was determined by diazotization of oc—naphthylamine and
coupling with sulfanilic acid. The method was practically the same as
the one used by Rider & Mellon (1946).

Determination of salt content. The salt content was measured partly
clectrometrically by use of a Radiometer salt tester and partly by pre-
cipitation with silver nitrate (AOAC, 1955). Preliminary experiments
with salt determination in bacon having different pH showed that the
two methods did not differ systematically in the results.

Determination of the glycogen content. The glycogen content was
determined after boiling with potassium hydroxide, precipitation and
hydrolysis (Brand, 1936) as reducing sugar (Hagedorn et al. 1946).
Preliminary experiments with analysis of glycogen in meat samples
after addition of small amounts of glucose showed that only a few
percent of the glucose content was precipitated with the glycogen. in the
method of analysis.

The bacterial counts. The bacterial contents in the cover pickles
were counted after dilution with 20 % saline and aerobic incubation on
peptone agar, pH 7.2, at 20° C. for 4—5 days.

The bacterial count on the cured sides: 10 samples of the meat or
rind surface were cut out. Each sample had an area of 10 cm2. The 10
samples were shaken with 100 ml. sterile water. Plating and incubation
as above.

The content of nitroso myoglobin in the meat

The content of nitroso myoglobin in the meat as measured by the
applied method did not seem clearly inﬂuenced by pH or ante-mortem

treatment of the pigs (Table 2), although the average ﬁgure was a little

lower for the hams cured with polyphosphate. There was, however,
much variation between the single hams within the groups. It is possible
that a number of other factors are of importance for the formation of
nitroso myoglobin in the meat. Exposure of the meat decreased the
amount of nitroso pigment in the meat. Neither pH nor polyphosphate
could be demonstrated to be important for the rate of this decrease.

The results of the determinations compared with the results of the
colour marks from the visual examination suggest that the paler colour
of the hams from the fed pigs is due to the meat being more opaque and
not to a smaller content of pigment.

The colour improving effect of the polyphosphates seems due to
improvement of meat transparency.

Salt content of the meat and cook out jelly

In table 3 are given the results of pH, salt content and jelly cooked
out in the hams. The heat treatment of the hams increased the pH of

the meat. This change of pH has been attributed partly to coagulation

and partly to denaturation of the proteins (Bate-Smith & Bendall,
1945). The amount of jelly has been reduced considerably by the ad—
dition of polyphosphate as expected. The reduction was most pronoun-
ced for the hams from the fed pigs. These hams had, on an average, a
higher percentage of jelly than those from the fasted pigs.

By statistical analysis the difference in jelly percentage between fed
and fasted pigs was found signiﬁcant at P =0.01. The difference between

those cured with and without polyphosphate was signiﬁcant at P =0.001..

The salt and nitrite content showed similar behaviour in relation to
pH and ante-mortem treatment as in earlier experiments.

Conclusion

The hams from the sugar fed pigs were, on an average, paler in colour
than those from fasted pigs. The meat colour was considerably improved
by the addition of sodium tripolyphosphate to the cure. The colour
stability seemed not as good in the hams from the fed pigs as in those
from the fasted pigs.

Material and Methods

Two stainless steel tanks each with a capacity of 20 Wiltshire sides
were installed in the curing cellars of the bacon factory (Andels-
Svineslagteri) in Kolding. In one, the sides from the fed pigs were
cured, in the other, those from the control pigs. Each week for 8 weeks
a batch of sides were cured. The feeding, slaughtering and curing pro-
cedure was the following:

Feeding. On Tuesday afternoon each week 15 pigs of bacon size were
selected for the experiment and weighed. The selection was made so
that only 1 pig from each single farm entered the experiment. The
pigs were put into a pen and fed 1 lb. of barley each. Three to four
hours before slaughtering they were each fed 2 lbs. sugar mixed with
1 lb. barley. Water was given ad libitum.

Slaughtering. The next day 15 pigs were selected and weighed in the
same manner as the fed pigs. These pigs formed the control group.
Both groups were killed after carbon dioxide stunning. After slaughter
the liver weight was determined. Of the inspected carcasses 10 were
selected from the fed pigs and 10 from the control pigs. The car-
casses were weighed immediately before entering the chilling room.
In the chilling room they were placed uniformly along one wall. The
day after chilling the carcasses were weighed in order to determine
the weight loss during chilling. pH was measured in m. gracilis—
adductor and tenderloin and m. biceps femoris.

Curing. The trimming and curing of the sides was done in accordance
with Danish standards. The sides were weighed before and after
pumping. At the start of the experiment a new cover pickle was prepared
for each tank. Care was taken to keep the two pickles separate during
the experiment. After each cure a sample of the pickle was taken and
analysed. On the basis of the results, the composition of the pickle
was adjusted and a new sample was taken for control. The sides were
cured for four days.

Maturation. During maturation the sides of the two lots were kept
separate but stacked precisely in the same way. Bacterial counts were
made on meat and rind of each side after 14 days maturing. Before
dispatch a sample was taken of 2 sides of each group. The sample was
cut at right angles to the side, the one being cut 1 cm. from the head
of the thigh bone and the other 15 em. up the side. From the samples
were cut slices which were fried for the taste panel. The salt and nitrite
content and pH of the bacon was determined. The rest of the gammon

The experiment demonstrated the importance of the transparency
of the meat ﬁbres on the colour of canned hams as far as the trans-
parency is affected by pH and polyphosphate. The hams cured with
polyphosphate had, on the average, a better colour in spite of a lower
content of nitroso myoglobin.

meat was dissected out, wrapped in a “Cry-o-vac” bag and heated
in a water bath at 70°C. for one hour. The colour and colour stability
were then evaluated in the cooked meat.

Special investigations. In the seventh week of the experiment, the
glycogen content was determined in the m. gracilis and tenderloin of
the right side of each carcass in the two lots. The samples for the
determinations were cut approximately gr};- of an hour after killing
and the day after curing exact where pH measurements were made.
The gammon of the sides sampled were cut oif after 14 days maturation.
These gammons were trimmed, etc., and pasteurized as canned hams.
Pasteurization took place in a water bath of 75°C. until the center of
the ham had a temperature of 63°C. About two weeks after cooking
the gammons were subjected to a taste panel at the Danish Meat
Products Laboratory (Slagterilaboratorium) and the percentage of
jelly measured.

Results and Discussion

Eﬂect of feeding on carcass weight

The feeding of 2 lbs. of sugar +1 lb. barley matched the appetite of
the animals as the troughs were emptied nearly every week.

The resting and feeding appears to have caused a loss of carcass
weight. In table 1 is shown the average ﬁgures for the live weight when

for each week. The fed pigs had, on the average, a higher live weight
than the controls. The average difference was 1.8 kg. The reason was
possibly that the pigs in the fed groups were delivered late in the day
and were fed before leaving the farm. The pigs in the control grtmps
were delivered early in the morning and not fed to any extent before
dispatch.

It is different in the case of the rail carcass weight where the i
pigs gave a lower weight than the control. The average difference i
1.4 kg.

The possible explanation for the bigger difference between live and
carcass weight in the fed group could be that the ration of 1 lb. barley
per pig in the evening was too small to satisfy the demand of the animais.

The difference in live weight and rail, carcass weight between the
groups were both signiﬁcant at P =0.001.

Eﬁect of feeding on liver percent and glycogen in the meat

After slaughter the feeding manifests itself in increased liver weight.
Table 2 gives the average liver percent for the fed and the control. pigs
in the different weeks. The liver percent is, on the average, 0.62 higher
for the fed pigs than for the controls. For a carcass weight of 65 kg. it
corresponds to 400 g. more liver. The increase is due to deposition of
glycogen in the liver. To test the correlation between liver perce it and
glycogen content in the muscles, the glycogen content was assayed in
the m. gracilis—adductor and tenderloin in the right hand sides of the

carcasses from the pigs slaughtered in the 7th week. Two determina—
tions were made in each muscle. After correction of the liver percentage
for differences in carcass weight a coefﬁcient of correlation of 0.75
was found between the glycogen content in the m. psoas and the liver
percent. The coefﬁcient is signiﬁcant at P = 0.001. Fig. 2 shows graphically
the correlation between glycogen content and liver percent. The cor—
relation coefﬁcient between the glycogen content in In. psoas and that
in m. gracilis-adductor was 0.83, also signiﬁcant at P =0.001.

The liver percents of the sugar fed pigs agree well with the liver
percentages Madsen (1942) found in group sugar feeding (2 kg. grain,
3 kg. potatoes, 3 kg. whey, 0.5 kg. sugar per pig per day). The liver
percent of the control pigs corresponds to the percentages of Madsen’s
normally fed pigs (2 kg. grain, 3 kg. potatoes, 3 kg. whey per pig per
day).

The pigs slaughtered immediately after delivery to the factory during
this experiment appear in a condition corresponding to the pigs fed
ordinarily right up to slaughter at the factory in Madsen’s experiment.

g 1b., that is, approximately 340 g., as a result of sugar feeding. The
weight increase in this experiment appears thus to be a little above the
Canadian results.

The results of the glycogen determinations are lower than Madsen’s
results and the results of the following experiments. The results are,
however, considerably above what Gibbons and Rose found. Between
the time of death and the time of enzyme inactivation in the meat sample
a considerable loss of glycogen appears to take place. In this experiment
the loss has been somewhat too high. The meat samples were brought
to the laboratory from the killing line to be weighed before enzyniw
inactivation took place. In the subsequent experiments the samples
were frozen with dry ice immediately after removal and processed :32
the frozen state. This procedure gave considerably higher glycogen value
for both groups.

Eﬂect of sugar feeding on pH of the meat

The glycogen of the meat is converted to lactic acid and various
other compounds during the ﬁrst day and night after slaughter. As a
result, pH decreases. Fig. 3 gives pH 24 hours after slaughter in rclatirm

to the glycogen content measured the day of slaughter. It appears that
a glycogen content above 0.45 % results in a pH of 5.35 5.45. Lower
glycogen contents give considerable variation in pH. Values between
5.3 and 6.1 were recorded. The average glycogen content in m. psoas
and m. gracilis-adductor was 0.62 and 0.44 respectively in the sugar
fed pigs. In the control pigs the results were 0.29 and 0.25 respectively
in the same muscles. These observations suggest that sugar feeding has
raised the glycogen content to a level which gives the meat a uniform
and low pH. The results of the pH measurements in all of the 159 pigs
of the experiment support this suggestion. In ﬁgures 4, 5, 6 and 7 are
shown block diagrams of the pH measurements in m. gracilis—ad-
ductor and m. biceps femoris of the carcasses from the sugar fed pigs
and the control pigs. It appears that among the carcasses from the sugar
fed pigs virtually none had pH above 6.0, while there was a considerable
number among the control pigs with pH above 6.0.

In table 3 are given average pH for m. psoas, 1n. gracilis-adductor
and m. biceps femoris. Statistical analysis showed that the differences
between the two groups of pigs were signiﬁcant at P =0.01. One notices
furthermore that there is great variance in pH from week to week. It

residual glycogen in the muscles after 20 weeks’ frozen storage even
if the ultimate pH was above 5.5.

During curing of the meat the residual glycogen is broken down so
that after removal from the cure the average glycogen content in the
meat was 0.04 % for both groups. The reason for the different rates of
conversion of the glycogen in the meat may be that it is metabolicallv
inhomogeneous. Stetten & Stetten (1955) suggest that the turnover of
glucosyl residues within the glycogen molecule is dependent on at
least two different types of enzymatic reactions which proceed at
different rates.

The content of citric acid had decreased since the ﬁrst determination
and was practically the same for the two groups,

The determination after curing

During curing the content of lactic acid fell considerably, apparently
owing to diffusion into the cover pickle. This diffusion was also noted
in the Kolding experiment. The pH of the meat increased approxi-
mately 0.1 units, that is, far less than one should expect from the fall
in lactic acid content. The explanation is possibly that the falling lactic
acid content has been counteracted by liberation of hydrogen ions from
the peptide chains by sodium ions introduced by the pickle. The content
of citric acid fell at the same rate as the lactic acid content.

The determination after maturation

After maturation the content of lactic acid and citric acid in the meat
had increased. The increase was probably due to equalization of the
contents by diffusion from the interior of the ham. The increase had
not caused the pH to drop. On the contrary pH increased a bit. The
reason for this behaviour is not clear.

two groups, the contents of the acids were, on an average, a little
higher in the meat from the fasted pigs. If the citrate components haw:
any effect at all on the weight loss of bacon sides it appears to be a negaw
tive one.

Conclusion

The difference in weight loss of the bacon sides appears hardly to be
related to the components of the citric acid cycle. If there is any effect
it tends to increase the weight loss.

Effect of hexose phosphates

Various observations in the literature suggest that hexose phosphates
are accumulated in meat during post-mortem glycolysis (Bate-Smith. 6-3:.
Bendall, 1947 and 1949). The accumulation appears due to blocking;
of the reaction fructose—G-phosphate +ATP—sfructose-1.6-diphosphate
+ADP (Sakov (1941)).

In order to investigate if there is any considerable difference in thy
accumulation of reducing sugars (mainly hexose phosphates) between-‘1
meat from sugar fed and fasted pigs a sugar feeding experiment “’34:
carried out.

Material and Methods

Tenderloins of sugar fed and fasted pigs were used for the chemicat
determinations. Resting and feeding of the pigs took place at the Mas
nedsund Bacon Factory. Of the deliveries to the factory, 10 pigs were
selected in an afternoon. The pigs were divided into two groups of
5 pigs each. Each group was placed in a separate pen. The pigs in
group 1 were fed 2 kg. barley per pig per day. About 3 hours before
slaughter they were fed 1 kg. sugar mixed with 0.5 kg. barley per pig.
The pigs in group 2 were not fed. The pigs in both groups got water ad
libitum. After a period of two days all of the pigs were slaughtered.
The sticking took place after electrical stunning. The tenderloins were
removed from the hot carcasses right after slaughter and chilled in a
household refrigerator. Two days after slaughter determinations of
pH, glycogen, and reducing sugars were made. The tenderloins were
weighed and immersed for 2 hours in a pickle containing 1 g. sodium
nitrite and 200 g. sodium chloride per litre. After removal from the
pickle the loins were kept in a closed glass jar at 40C. for 8 days. After
3 and 8 days samples were removed for the second and third determi—
nations of the above mentioned compounds.

de tekniske Videnskaber (ATV) 0g anlnodede dette 0111 en udtalelse 0111,
hx'orvid’t 111an Ville vmre Villig til at foretage en undersyﬁgelse til konstatering
af, 0111 der var grundlag for at antage, at elektrisk beddvning (el-bedgzjvning)
111edf¢rer forrinp‘else af svinek¢d i form af 111uskelbl¢dninger i skinke, kam
og bug; ringere afblodningsgrad; ¢get muskelstivhed saint en forringelse af
kodets holdbarhed, navnlig ved en for¢gelse af dettes pH.

ATV besvarede justitsministeriets henvendelse ganske f0rel¢bigt den
.10. marts 1955, og i en skrivelse til ministeriet af 18. april 1955 kunne aka-
demiet 111eddele, at det havdc set Sig i stand til at nedsaette et udvalg med
det formal at foretage e11 undersgﬁgelse til konstatering af, 0111 der er grund-

UDVALGETS FORSQG

ministeriet 01ntalte skader var staerkt divergerende 0g gennemgéende helier
'ikke hvilede pé et tilfredsstillende eksperilnentelt grundlag. Udvalge't beslu't—

ders¢gelser pé’l svin, slagtet henholdsvis med 0g uden el-bedgbvning for at néi
fl‘em til et eentydigt billede af skadernes 0111fang 0g art. Med den hensigt
eventuelt at kunne angive en forbedret el-beddvningsteknik, ved anvendelse

har direkte tilknytning til de dl‘agne konklusionel'.

El-bedevningen: Dens teknik 0g Virkemz‘ide.

Bedﬂvningsteknikken.

El-bedevningen foregé’u‘ \'ed, at en elektl'isk strem 21f passende styrke
sendes tVzel‘s gennein svinets hovede. E11 del af str¢1nmen Vii passere svinets
hjerne med det resultat, at der indtraeffer en tilstand af bevidstlgzﬁshed hos
dyret uf laengere eller kortere Val‘ighed, afhzengende af mz‘iden hvm‘pé be—
dyﬁvningen udf¢res.

Strgénlgennemgangen effektueres ved hjaelp af en sékaldt bedgﬁvnings-
fang. Denne kun were udforlnet soni en metaltang 21f eil‘ka 341 meters laengde;
p51 hver af dens t0 kzeber er anbragt en elektl'ode, isoleret f‘a tangens gAVI‘ige
stel. Elektl‘oderne er 1 forbindelse med en egnet spzendingskilde (omformer,
resp. transformer). Almindeligvis er elektl'oderne under spzending yennem
hele slagtetiden, 0g siren]gennemgangen begynder derfor i det ejeblik, da
lungens elektroder ber¢rer svinets hovede. Det er af Vigtighed for hedyh-
ningens Yellykkede udfgzn‘else, at tanp‘en er konstrueret séledes, at der ¢je-
blikkelig etableres en god kontakt mellem tangens elektroder 0g svinets
hovede. Ved udvalgets forsng i Sore benyttedes en Siemens tohéndstang;
denne adskiller sig i princippet kun lidt fl'a andre eksisterende tohénds-
taenger.

 




 

 

 

10

Ved bedovningens begyndelse anbringes tangens elektroder pa svinets
hovede bag orerne; laengere hen i bed¢vningsfasen drejes tangen saledes,
at den ene elektrode komnier til at ligge over det ene af dyrets ¢jne, hvorved
der opnés, at en storre del af den samlede strQSm komlner til at passere gen-
nem svinets hjerne. .

Ved udvalgets f¢rste forsogsserier benyttedes den saedvanlige el-bedov—
ningsteknik, 50111 i en laengere arraekke har x'aeret anvendt af SorQS Andels—
slagteri (i det folgende betegnet som rul‘inemetoden). Teknikken ved denne
metode var folgende:

Vekselspaendingen pa bedovningstangens elektroder var 85 Volt (den
saedvanlig anvendte). Elektroderne holdtes fugtede ved hyppig dypning i
saltvand. Bedovni11gsstr¢1nmen lob i middel cirka 8 sekunder, dog varierende
fra dyr til dyr, idet bed¢veren afventede det tidspunkt, da en Vis afslapning
af dyret indtradte. Efter tangens fjernelse blev dyret opkaedet i stikelevato-
ren, 0g stikningen foretoges. Tidsintervallet mellem tangens fjernelse 0g
stikningen var (i overensstemmelse med Veterinaerdirektoratets vejledning
af 2—2-1955) i gennemsnit ca. 50 sekunder, det Vil sige, at stikningen fore—
toges i slutningen af den kloniske fase resp. i begyndelsen af det komatose
stadium (om disse jfr. afsnittet 0111 el-bedovningens Virkemade s. 12).

Forskellige overvejelser angaende de aendrede kredslobsforhold, der op-
star hos svinet under strompavirkningen 0g i de efterfolgende par minutter,
forte udvalget til det resultat, at der skulle vaere en mulighed for at mindske,
resp. helt eliminere, forekomsten af de muskelblgzﬁdninger, der tilskrives el-
bedovningen, dersom bed¢vnings- ()g slagtetelcnilcken aendredes sdledes, at
stikningen foretages pd et tidligt tidspunkl‘. I samme retning pegede ogsa
oplysninger indhentede ved bes¢g pa slagteriet SCAN, Angelholm, Sverige,
samt skriftlige informationer fra chief veterinary officer D. J. Anthony,
M.R.C.V.S. (Messr. Marsh & Baxter Ltd. Brierly Hill, Staffs, England). Dot
fremgik heraf, at man ansé’l det for afgorende for bedovningens vellykkede
udfylrelse, at stikningen foretoges sa hurtigt som muligt efter tangens fjer-
nelse. En aendret el-bedovningsteknik blev derfor afprovet i udvalgets senere
forsgzﬁgsserier. Denne metode beneevnes i rapportens tabeller kart interval.
Metoden er som naevnt karakteriseret ved, at tidsintervallet mellein afbryd—
ning af bed¢vningsstr¢mmen (ved tangens fjernelse) og stikning afkortes
til det mindst mulige. Teknikken var den, at bedoveren holdt tang‘en p51
dyret for og under opkaedningen, hvorefter stikningen foretoges umiddel—
bart efter, at tangen var fjernet fra dyrets hovede. Stromgennemgangen va-
rede ved denne metode gennemsnitlig 10 sekunder, 09‘- intervallet mellem
tangens fjernelse og‘ stikningen var i gennemsnit 5 sekunder, det Vil sige
stikningen fandt sted, inden dyret kom i den kloniske fase (jfr. afsnittet om
el-bedovningens Virkeniade, side 12).

Teknisk undersagelse af det hidtidigt benyttede apparatur.

Ved gennemgangen af de foreliggende oplysninger vedrorende omfanget
af skaderne forarsaget af el-bedovningen blev det pa et tidligt tidspunkt
lilart for udvalget, at omfanget af skaderne bed¢mtes forskelligt af de for-
skellige slagterier. Eftersom de forskellige slagterier anvender forskelligt
apparatur til udf¢relsen af den elektriske bedovning, ansa udvalget det for
nodvendigt at underkaste de forskellige typer af bedovningsapparatur en
mermere teknisk undersgbgelse. Undersyﬁgelsen omfattede folgende appa-
ratur:

1: en omformer (Kemp & Lauritzen)

2: en transformer (Liibcke)

3: et bedovningsapparat (Elther, benyttes ikke i Danmark)
4: en bedovningstang (Siemens ,,spidse elektroder“)

4): en bedovningstang (Siemens nr. S. 36 ,,k¢dhammerelektroder").

Undersogelserne omfattede: Isolationsmalinger, optagelse af strom- og
spaendingskarakteristikker for omformer og transformer, registrering af
laekstrommen til jord fra omformer og‘ transformer samt for Elther appara-
tets vedkommende kontrollering af angivelserne pa dette.

Isolationsmdlingerne gav som resultat, at alle isolationsmodstandene var
tilfredsstillende store for omformeren, transformeren samt for taengerne,
sa laenge disse var torre (20—50 millioner ohm). Efter dypning at" elektro-
derne i saltvand — en sadan finder normalt sted ved brugen af tangen —-~-
var isolationsmodstanden, det Vil sige modstanden mellem elektroderne 0g
taengernes stel, utilfredsstillende lav, ofte kun 30—100 ohm. Dette medf¢rer,
at bedovningstangens stel under brugen bliver stromforende, og at der ud—
over den str¢m, der gar gennem dyret, tillige gar en meget betydelig strom
fra den ene elektrode gennem tangens stel til den anden elek‘trode.

De gévrige elektriske mc‘ilinger Viste ingen vaesentlige forskelle mellem
de forskellige apparater og giver ingen anledning til omtale.

Under hensyntagen til den h¢je fugtighedsgrad, der hersker i slagterier,
kan det sammenfattende siges, at undersogelserne har Vist, at saml‘lige appa—
rater, selv om de er approberede, principielt er uheldigt konstruerede. De.
frembyder et risikomoment for bed¢veren, i saerdeleshed dersom isolationen
i transformeren skulle svigte, samt forarsager et unyttigt forbrug af str¢m.

Udvalget Vil i swrdeleshed gore opmaerksom pa den fare, der maske kan
Vaere forbundet med at tage transformeren i brug efter lang tids henstand
i fugtig atmosfaere.

Udvalget henstiller til justitsministeriet, at det henleder Elektricitets-
kommissionens opmaerksomhed pa resultatet af udvalgets undersgﬁgelser af
det hidtidigt benyttede apparatur, saledes at denne kan tage hele spySrgs—

malet op til fornyet. overvejelse.

Udfra de her naevnte erfaringer konstrueredes en bed¢vningstang, dei'

Flertallet af tilfaeldene var dog af. lettere grad. I lungerne af ubedyﬁvede svin
konstateredes kun lettere blodninger 0g kun i fé tilfaelde. Den omtalte zen—
dring af el-bedovningsteknikken med nedsat interval mellem stryjmgennem—
ggangens ophyAr og stikning nedbragte ikke antallet af lungeblodningerne,
snarest syntes hyppigheden noget foroget ved denne metode.

Blodninger i lungerne kan imidlertid i almindelighed ikke tillaegges
storre betydning, nér talen er 0111 en bedylmmelse af el-bedovningens unven-
delighed.

Den fysiologiske baggrund for muskel- 0g lungehlodningernes optraeden
ved el-bedovningen.

Hvad angér de sékaldte diffuse blodninger, er der naeppe tvivl om, at
de er forérsaget af rent mekaniske 2°1rsager i forbindelse med transporten
og slagtningen 0g séledes er el-bedovningen uvedkommende. Med hensyn til
lungeblngdninger og punktformede blodninger méi disse opfattes som frem-
kommet ved en bristning af hé’lrkarvzeggen, sandsynligvis som f¢lge af e't
oget indre tryk. [Endringer i svinets blodkredslob forérsaget 21f den elek-
lriske bedovning méi derfor sk¢nnes at were of at‘gorende betydning for de
(wennaevnte skaders optraeden. Der foreligger kun fé’l forsog udfyjrt péi grise
med hensyn til dette speeielle problem, men erfaringer 0g forsop' udf¢rt pé
undre dyr Vil kunne belyse dette problem tilstraekkeligt.

Ved strompévirkningen af grisens hjerne Vil ogsé dybere dele 21f denne
stimuleres, heriblandt det blodtryksregulerende eentrum i den forlaengede
marv. Den umiddelbare Virkning heraf er, at hjertets pumpevirksomhed
torbigéende nedsaettes. Dette skyldes dels stimulation af de haemmende
nervetréde til hjertet 0g dels en voldsom stigning i trykket i brysthulen foré’lr—
saget af den toniske krampe (se side 12) i bug- 0g brystmuskler. Samtidig Vil
den yenerelle toniske k‘ampe i svinets muskler bevirke, at blodet i disses
hiirkar presses ud; det Vil sige i den toniske fase mé’i musklerne anses for
stort set at vaere blodtomme. Som folge heraf Vil blodet stemmes op i de
store vener naer hjertet. Da endvidere hjertets pumpevirksomhed er nedsat,
Vi] hjertet ikke kunne viderebefordre den samme meenpfde blod, som strgzsm-
mer ’lil det, 0g der opstér en opstemning (stase) af blodet i venesystemet,
resulterende i en generel stigning af trykket pé den ve11¢se side at kreds-
lo’bet til mere end det dobbelte af normalvazrdien. Det arterielle blodtryk
stiger ligeledes forhigéende til eirka det dobbelte at normalvmnlien. Denne
blodtryksstigning skyldes en kontraktion af organismens sméi urterier (arte-
rioler), hvorved arteriesystemets modstand mod genne1nstr¢mning oges.
Som f¢lge af at hjertets pumpevirksomhed midlertidigt er haemmet, ses
denne arterielle blodtryksstigning f¢rst ef‘ter eirka 10 sekunders for1¢b.

Eftersom muskulaturens hé’lrkar er totalt afklemte under den toniske
fuse, Vil der vaere meget ringe mulighed for at 1’51 punklformede bl¢dninfrer

under denne. I den kloniske fase derimod, hvor musklerne udfg/n'er inei‘e
rykvise sammentraekninger, Vil blodet have mulighed for at passei‘e gen~
nem Visse omré’lder af llz‘irkarnettet. Eftersom trykket p51 den vengése side
af hérkarret er steget til mere end det dobbelte, betyder det, at for at day
overhovedet kan passere blod gennem et hé’u‘kar, mil ogsé middeltryklusi:
i dette were steget til mere end det dobbelte. Da samtidig det arterielle blod
tryk ogsﬁ er steget, 11151 man derfor regne med, at det indre tryk i innsklmw
nes hz‘irkar stiger meget betydeligt i den f¢rste del af den kloniske f‘dSC.

Muligheden for at f2°1 en hristning af hérkarrets vaeg Vil derfor were 543;

al' svinene (usaedvanlig ringe styrke af hérkarsveeggen), idet disse blgﬁdniéa—
ger kun Optreeder med ringe hyppighed.

De ovennaevnte kredslyjbsaendringer giver en rimelig forklaring pit, iii
lungeblyldningerne ses hyppigere hos el—bedgbvede end hos ubedgﬁvede swim:
Det egede ven¢se tryk Vil naturligvis ogsé’l findes i det lille ln'eda‘lizaaii
(lungekredslgbbet). Dertil kommer, at den egede belastning af lungens lama

El-bedevningens indﬂydelse pa pH-vaerdien i k0det.

Spyirgsmé’llet 0m el-bed¢vningens indflydelse pa pH—Vaerdien 0g k¢dets
huldbarhed har vaeret genstand for stor interesse i slagterikredse. Pa grund—
lag af pH-mé’llinger foretaget af Slagteriernes Forskningsinstitut 0g holdbar—

hedsundersyﬁgelser foretaget af Baconkontrollen —~ eller efter dennes ret—
n‘ingslinier —— har det veeret haevdet, at el—bedgﬁvning medf¢rer en nedsat

lmldbarhed af k¢det.

Det er velkendt, at der bestér en Vis sammenhaeng mellem kgAdets‘ hold—
barhed 0g dets surhedsgrad (pH) pa den made, at et h¢jt initialt pH 0fte
fremmer V'oeksten af Visse bakterier, 0g at forrédnelse er ledsaget af en
stigning i l<¢dets pH. Ved en vurdering af den gramsevaerdi for pH, som ma
anses for at were udtryk for en nedsat holdbarhed, ma man tage i betragt-
ning, at man bade hos bedgjvede 0g ubedgzﬁvede svin finder en ret betydelig
variation i pH fra dyr til dyr.

Det har vaeret heevdet, isaer pa grundlag af mélinger der i de f0r1¢bne
21°11" er udfgﬁrt af Slagteriernes Forskningsinstitut i Roskilde, at kdd af elek-
[risk bedyévede svin (rutinemetoden) har et h¢jere pH (0,2 pH-enheder)
end kgAd af 11bed¢vede svin. Blandt andet heraf har man ment at kunne
slutte, at holdbarheden af k¢det, der hidr¢rer fra elektrisk bed¢vede SVin,
skulle veere mindre end holdbarheden af k¢d fra ubed¢vede svin. F0rs¢gs-
serierne er udf¢rt ved at anbringe en spydformet glaselektrode direkte i den
muskel, hvis pH man ¢nsker at kende.

Udvalget har udfgsrt en orienterende fors¢gsraekke med benyttelse af
denne fremgangsmade.

Der foretoges 10 malinger p51 forskellige steder p51 klumpmusklen i
skinken i hvert af de svin, der kom til undersylgelse, for saledes at opna et
middeltal for pH-Vaerdien med en ikke alt for stor spredning. Malingerne

KONKLUSIONER

Der er for udvalge't ingen tvivl 0111, at der i slagterierne ved anvendel-
sen af el-bed¢vningen har foreligget et problem med hensyn til Optrze—
den af muskelblgbdninger. Ogsé i udvalgets materiale er kvalitetsforrin-
gende, punktformede bl¢dninger forekommet; hos 385 ryggede svin.
el-bedyﬁvede efter den hidtil anvendte metode, fandtes sédanne b1¢dnin-
ger i 3 tilfzelde, 0g blandt 79 Opskérne skinker, stammende fra svin
hedgivede med samme teknik, fandtes kvalitetsforringende bl¢dninger
i k¢det fra 4 skinker. I inlet tilfaelde iagttoges sé’ldanne bl¢dninger i
kgzidet fra 11bed¢vede svin.

Udvalgets undersgzﬁgelser har vist, at optraeden af kvalitetsforringende,
punktfornlede muskelbl¢dninger kan undgi’ls, hvis man nedsaetter tids«
intervallet mellem str¢mgennemgangens 0ph¢r 0g stikningen meget‘
betydeligt, fra ca. 50 sekunder til ca. 5 sekunder. Det pépeges, at et
heldigt resultat af den ny el—bedylvningsteknik afhaenger af, at denne
udfgbres nyﬁjagtig som beskrevet.

Del el-hedyivede svin méi antages at were bevidstlgﬁs i hele 'tidsrul‘nmet'
i'i'u stl‘gimgennemgangens begyndelse, 0g til dyret er stukket.

De diffuse blgjdninger optraeder med samme hyppighed, hvad enten
dyret er ‘ubedpvet eller beddvet. Dette gaelder, hvad enten bed¢vningen
liar fundet sted med rutinemetoden eller med den nu foresliiede ,,k0rt

in tervul“ —1net0de.

Det i {Ajeblikket anvendte bed¢vningstaenger b¢r af1¢ses af taenger med
stel udfylrt af isolerende materiale. Det hidtil anvendte bed¢vningsappa-
ratur kan efter udvalgets mening under visse omstaendigheder fl'em—
byde en risiko for ud¢veren. Udvalget henstiller, at Elektrieitetskomo
missionens oplnaerksomhed henledes pé’l resultatet af udvalgets under-
s¢gelser af det hidtidigt benyttede apparatur, séledes at denne kan tage
hele spgo’rgsméilet 0p til fornyet overvejelse.

Udvalgets undersgﬁgelser under anvendelse af kort interval metoden
11:11“ givet det eentydige resultat, at pH i macerat af m. gracilis fra skin-
ker fra ubedgjvede 0g bed¢vede svin var det samme. Med pH som indi-
Lkator for holdbarheden mé’l udvalget slutte, at der i den foreliggende
forsgzigsserie ikke kunne konstateres forskelle i holdbarheden af k¢d
fra hed¢vede 0g ubed¢vede svin.

Heller ikke ved organoleptiske 0g kemiske unders¢gelser har ud-
Valget konstateret forskelle med hensyn til holdbarheden af k¢d fm

bed¢vede 0g ubed¢vede svin.

Rapport over Slagtemetodeudvalgets forsag over

0g ubedgvede svin.

(udfm‘t p51 Somegnens Andelsslagteri 24. april 1956)

I april 1956 besluttede udvalget at {rennemfgzire et nyt forsysg med :1
blik pé’l sp¢rgsm§11et 0111 el-bedgbvningens indflydelse pé’l pH-vaerdien i EmaieE
af slagtede svin. Man fandt det nQdeendigt at tilvejebringe et lilatei'iaEe EEi

Som f¢1ge af at de direkte pH—mélinger (med spydformet glaselekh'ode
anbragt i muskelsubstansen) havde udvist en Sé stor variation indenfor den
samme muskel, ansa alle det for n¢dvendigt at benytte muskelmacerater til

otter at de havde opholdt Sig et d¢gn i k¢lerummet, d. v. s. ved en tempe-
ratul‘ pa ca. 2° C. For at opna den st¢rst mulige eensartethed af materialet
hesluttedes det at gennemfgbre fors¢get pa svin slagtet pa een 0g samme
(flag. Forsgzlget gennemf¢rtes pa den made, at svinene slagtedes under be-
l'iyéi‘ig kontrol mandag den 23. april 1956, 0g pH-malingerne foretoges sa
den naeste dag, tirsdag den 24. april. For at gennemfgére et sa emfattende
Mrsgjg pa een dag var det naturligvis n¢dvendigt at indsaette et betydeligt
antal deltagere (ialt 18) i f0rs¢get. Forud for fors¢get var der blevet ud—
arbejdet en detailleret fors¢gsplan, som udleveredes til hver deltager, sale-
(leg at alle var bekendt med f0rs¢gsgangen. Endvidere havde man forud for
forsglget foretaget Visse orienterende f0rs¢g for at sikre malingernes een-
lydighed.

FORSQGSGANGEN
fl. Slagtedag (mandag den 23. april).

SVinene slagtedes med 0g uden forudgaende el-bedijning i hold pa ca.
20 af gangen. I folden f¢r stikkestien maerkedes svinene med en tatoverings-
tang pa skinkepartiet (0 for el-bed¢vning 0g 1 for ingen bed¢vning). For at
sikre Sig at alle svinene var beh¢rigt maerkede, samt for at lette bed¢vnings—
personalet arbejdet med at finde ud af, hvilken behandling hvert svin skulle
udsaettes for, pamaledes hvert svin samtidig med tatoveringen med en farve
(mid :2 el—bed¢vning; gr¢n z ingen bed¢vning).

I stikkefolden var der placeret en iagttager, som var fortrolig med ,,k0rt
interval“met0dens korrekte udf¢relse. Alle de svin, der af een eller anden
grund ikke blev bed¢vet forskriftsmaessigt, maerkedes af stikkeren med et
g/jresnit. Svin, som ved ankomsten til stikkefolden ansas for at vaere syge,
maerkedes ligeledes. med et ¢resnit. Ved vaegten i slagteriet frasorteredes alle
de svin, som havde et ¢1‘esnit, samt de svin der havde faet en bemaerkning
ved dyrlaegekontrollen. Alle disse svin anbragtes pa et seerligt sted i k¢le-
rummet, séledes at de ikke indgik i naeste dags f0rs¢gsmateriale.

2. Maledagen (tirsdag 24. april 1956)

Forsgﬁget begyndte kl. 6.00 0111 morgenen. Kyldprijerne blev udskaret pa

Pr¢ven udtoges fra m. gracilis i skinken 0g pl'ijeudtagningen foretoges af

delte 1(ng vejedes pa en Rex veegt 0g anbragtes i et 100 ml baegerglas, 0g
tatoveringssignaturen bleV skrevet pa baegerglasse-t. Derefter tilsattes 1%;

ind i trikinlaboratoriet. Her var Opstillet t0 Waring blendors. Indholdet at
hvert maleglas haeldtes over i blendorkarret 0g macereredes i 1/2 min. Man
havde i forvejen ved f0rf0rs¢g sikret sig, at man inden for dette tidsrum
ville opna en fuldstaendig homogenisering af k¢det, samt at behandlingon i
blendoren ikke Ville bevirke nogen naevnevaerdig temperaturstigning at
maceratet. Nar maceringen va ' afsluttet, haeldtes den homogeniserede kgédm
prgzjve tilbage i baegerglasset, ,og tidspunktet for macerationen pategnedes
haegerglasset, som derefter anbragtes 1351 et bord i gangen. Denne del at for--
s¢get f0rl¢b fra k1. 6.00 til kl. 11, inden for hvilket tidspun'kt man mace“
rerede 02. 500 pr¢ver med assistance af 12 personer.

‘ De faerdige maeerater henstod ved 20° C i mindst 6 timer, fySr pH—mziliw
gen pabegyndtes. I stadsdyrla—zgens kontor var Opstillet 4 pH-metre (Radiw
meter pH-M22), som havde braendt natten over, saledes at de ved nialingem;
begyndelse var kommet i deres stationaere tilstand. For at gennemfyjre 1115mm
gen at de cirka 500 pr¢ver inden for et overskueligt tidsrum deltes pi‘gﬁvem «1:
mellem t0 maleopstillinger. For i rimelig grad at sikre Sig mod eventualle
malefejl foretoges hver pH-bestemmelse pa et macerat som en d0bbelt~
bestemmelse pa f¢lgende made: F¢r malingen omryﬁrtes det pagaeldende
macerat omhyggeligt med en ren spate] 0g haeldtes over pa t0 pH-malebaegrea
0g hver halvdel af maeeratet maltes samtidig pa hvert sit pH-meter. Alle
pH-metrene justeredes fra en faelles standard st¢dpude oplgjsning (5.50),
Hver af de fire pH-malere f¢rte sin egen protokol, hvori noteredes koden
af mace 'atet (0 resp. 1), tiden for macereringen samt tiden for pH-malin—
gen. I'umiddelbar tilslutning til hver pH-maling dikterede de respekti've
pH—malere fra hver af de t0 grupper resultaterne til en listef¢rer, som fgjrte
forsgbgets hovedliste samt fQSrte kontrol med f0rs¢get som helhed. Dertil—
lodes saledes ikke afvigelser ved dobbeltbestemmelsen pa mere end 0,04 pH-
enhede‘r. I tilfaelde hvor dette indtradte, matte pH—meterne efterjusteres, 0g
malingen gentages. Detlykkedes herved i alle tilfaelde undtagen eet at holde
variationsomradet ved dobbelvtbestemmelsen inden for ovennaevnte margin.
I de‘t ene tilfaelde, hvor dette af uforklarlige grunde ikke lykkedes, kassere—

Resultatet af opggsrelsen 21f materialet er altséi f¢lgendez

I: bedgﬁvede gsvin:

Middelvaerdien for 249 macerater, pH :— 5.466
Standardafvigelse: 0.136 pH-enheder

Middelfejl p51 middelvzerdien: 0.009 pH-enheder.

II: ubedgbvede 30in:

Middelvaerdien for 224 maceratel‘, pH = 5.478
Standardafvigelse: 0.133 pH—enheder

Middelfejl pé middelvzerdien: 0.009 pH—enheder.

Differencen mellem de to middelvaerdier er 0.012 pH—enheder 0g har en
middelfejl p51 0.013 pH-enheder. Konklusionen vil derfor vaere, at de to for»
delinger med hensyn til pH-vaerdierne af maeeraterne fra ubedgﬁvede 0g
bed¢vede svin ikke afviger statistisk signifikant fra hinanden med hensyn
til middelvaerdi 0g standardafvigelse.

I den foreliggende analyse er materialet grupperet i klasseintervaller p5:-
0.05 pH—enheder. Der er imidlertid ogsé’l foretaget beregninger pé’l middeltal»~
let 0g spredningen direkte pé de foreliggende Observationer, idet det kunne
taenkes, at den ovennaevnte gruppering kunne bevirke smé afvigelser, son},
kunne vaere af betydning. Det viser Sig imidlertid, at grupperingen i klasse—
intervaller 13:31 0.05 pH-enheder ikke er af naevnevaerdig betydning for resul—
tatet, idet analysen 11f de ugrupperede méleresultater giver f¢lgendez

(a) bed¢vede svin: ml 2 5.446, S.D. : 0.0135
(b) ubedijede svin: ml 2 5.479, SD. = 0.0134.

Det endelige mé’lleresultat b¢r formodentlig ikke angives med mere end
to betydende decimaler, eftersom méleusikkerheden pé’l de for tiden anvendie
pH—metre er af en sédan st¢rrelse, at selv et n01: sé stort antal niélinger
ikke kan forventes at fastlaegge det endelige mz‘ileresultat med stgjrre n¢jag—
tighed. . .

Fordelingen af de relative hyppigheder af pH-vaerdierne i de t0 grupper
er vist i nedenstéende histogrammer (fig. 1). Eftersom méleﬂsikkerheden
var af st¢rrelsesordenen 0.02 pH-enheder, sk¢nnedes det rimeligt at anvende
et klasseinterval pé’l 0.1 pH-enhed (5 X mé’lleusikkerheden). Det ses, at de t0
fordelingers almindelige f0r1¢b ikke viser nogen afggzﬁrende forskel, selvom
der forekommer enkelte afvigelser, sé’lvel i midten som i fordelingens yder—
punkter. For fuldstaendigheds skyld har man ogsé udregnet den kumulerede
hyppighed af de t0 fordelinger. Ved den kumulerede hyppighed forstés den
procentdel af méleresultaterne som er mindre eller lig med en given pH-
vaerdi. Resultatet fremgér af tabel 3. Det ses ogsé heraf, at de to fordelinger

ARMSTRONG WHITWORTH & COMPANY (PNEUMATIC TOOLS) LIMITED

April 3, 1962

'Mrs. Christine Stevens
Animal Welfare Institute
22 East 17th Street
New'York, N. Y.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

A few weeks ago Mrs. Dorothy Dyce advised us that she had wit-
nessed a demonstration of our CG-2 Cattle Stunner at the Peet Packing
Company at Chesaning, Michigan. She asked our cooperation in inves-
tigating an instance where the plunger of our Stunner remained in the
animal's skull.

The writer visited the Peet Packing plant on March 30th and
talked to Mr. Henry Kowalski in the stunning room. He advised that
they have two of our cattle stunners ~ one in constant use and the
other as a standuby tool. He is extremely pleased with the perfor-
mance of both tools.

He further advised that recently they have been stunning the
cattle behind the ears rather than the forehead. This methgd
eliminated chances of the plunger sticking when the tool is held
at the proper angle.

Contrary to our recommendations, there were two animals waiting
to be stunned in the knocking boxes. When an operator reaches
across one animal to stun another, the possibility of the plunger
sticking increases. It is very important that our tool he held at
the proper angle as outlined in our serv1ce manual.

There is alway a possibility that a sudden movement by the
animal can cause a misdirected shot. This is unfortunate, but is
something that we have no control over. If this happens, our
instructions are to push the Stunner forward and a second shot
will free the plunger.

Mr. Kowalski said that the operator had developed his technique
so that even with two animals in the knocking boxes, there had been
very few instances when the plunger had remained 1n the animal’s

skull.

December 14, 1959

Mrs. Christine Stevens
Animal Welfare Institute
22 East 17th Street

New Ybrk 3, New Ybrk

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Your letter of December llth was received by me
this morning and I will be most happy to inform you how the
discrepancy in the article that appeared in the National Pro»
visioner and the instructions that we issue came about.

Actually, in the work that we have done the PRESCO
LEKTRO—STUN will render hogs insensible to pain when the
electrodes are placed on the frontal area as described in
the National Provisioner. However, in the instructions that
we issued we felt that it would be advisable to be more
specific, and we did not want the Operator of the PRESCO
LEKTRO~STUN to remove the electrode far enough from.the area
of the brain so that a partial stun would be effected. We
felt as you do, that it is advisable to create an electrical
field in the area immediately surrounding the brain to
render the animal insensible to pain immediately.

In answering your second question, we have worked
with thousands and thousands of animals and we have yet to
kill one by an electric shock. The voltage and the amperage
that we use is sufficiently low to make this a virtual impos»
sibility.

We have also determined that it is advisable to
stick the animal as soon after stun as possible. However, in
a period of 5 to 10 seconds we have not experienced any dif~
ficulty in the bleeding and the incidents of lung hemorrhage
have been virtually non~existent.

at the request of the

Ministry of JuStice

SUMMARY.

The report contains in a summarizing form the committee's

investigations on the effect of electric stunning on the quality of pork,

particularly whether electric stunning could cause hemorrhages in the

ham, loin and belly and in general more perishable meat.

It is shown that deleterious punctate hemorrhages in the muscles
can be avoided if the time interval between the interruption of current
flow and sticking is reduced to about 5 sec. Organoleptic and chemical
investigations showed no difference in the perishability of the meat
from stunned and unstunned hogs. The pH in macerate of m. gracilis

from hams from unstunned and stunned h0g8 was the same.

COMMITTEE ON SLAUGHTERING METHODS
appointed by the
Danish Academy of Technical Sciences
at the request of the

Ministry of Justice

On February 16, 1955, the Ministry of Justice addressed itself to
the Academy of Technical Science and inquired whether the Academy would
be willing to investigate the effect of electric stunning on the quality of
pork, particularly whether it could cause hemorrhages in the ham, loin
and belly; less complete exsanguination; increased muscle rigidity or
more perishable meat, specifically by causing an increase in its pH.

The Academy informed the Ministry of Justice on April 18, 1955, that
the Academy was prepared to appoint a committee to investigate whether
there was any basis for assuming that electric stunning resulted in a
deterioration in the quality of pork of the nature mentioned in the Ministry
of Justice's request. '

The committee was named the COMMITTEE ON SLAUGHTERING
METHODS and its members were:

Dr. H. Jorgensen, Professor of Technical biochemistry at the Royal

 

Danish Technical University (Chairman). Dr. F. Buchthal, Professor

of Neurophysiology at the University of Copenhagen. Dr. H. Fredholm,
Director of the Laboratory of the Union of Meat Packers of Sweden,
Stockholm. Aa. Jepsen, Professor of Veterinary Bacteriology and Hygiene
at the Royal Danish Veterinary and Agricultural College. H.H. Johansen,
Veterinary Inspector at the Cooperative Meat Packing Plant of Jutland
(JAKA), Brabrand. M. Jul, Director of the Danish Meat Research Institute,
Roskilde. Dr. R.E.H. Rasmussen, Professor of Technical Physics at the

 

Royal Danish Technical University. The Committee's technical secretary

W38:

Dr. O. Sten-Knudsen, The Institute of Neurophysiology, University of

 

Copenhagen.

 




 

 

 

The Committee held its organizational meeting on March 23, 1955 and
held 12 meetings in all. In addition, various members of the Committee,
during and in connection with the experiments, held detailed discussions on
the problems which arose in connection with the Committee's experiments.

The following instituions and establishments assisted the Committee

in the experiments:

THE COMMITTEE'S EXPERIMENTS

After its first meetings, it was clear to the Committee that the
available information concerning the extent and significance of the damage
mentioned by the Ministry was based on conflicting and unsatisfactory
experimental data. The Committee decided therefore to undertake a series
of investigations on hogs slaughtered with and without electric stunning, to
establish the degree and type of injury. Furthermore an attempt was made
to acquire knowledge of the physiological events during electric stunning
which might contribute to or cause certain of the above-mentioned traumata

with the end in view to devising an improved method of electric stunning.

The following investigations were carried out:

A technical examination of the different types of stunning apparatus. An
investigation of the type and frequency of occurrence of intramuscular
hemorrhage incident to slaughter. An investigation of the frequency of
occurrence of pulmonary hemorrhage incident to slaughter. An investigation
of the perishability of fresh hog carcasses in conjunction with pH measure-
ments of the flesh. .

A brief account follows of the results of the above-mentioned investigat-
ions and of the conclusions which the Committee has been able to draw from
them. In addition, reference is made to any of the Committee's considerations

which bear directly on the conclusions.

ELECTRIC STUNNING: TECHNIQUE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM

Stunning te chnique:

Electric stunning is effected by passing a suitable electric current
across the hog's head. The current which traverses the hog's brain renders
the animal unconscious for a period the duration of which depends on the
stunning method. The current is applied through so-called stunning tongs.
These may be shaped like metal tongs about 3/4 meters long; on each of
the jaws is an electrode, insulated from the rest of the frame. The elec-
trodes are connected to an appropriate current source (converter or transfor-
mer) during the entire slaughtering period and the current ﬂows at the moment
the electrodes come in contact with the hog's head. At the beginning of the

stunning process, the electrodes are placed on the head of the hog behind the

 




 

 

ears; later in the stunning phase, the tongs are rotated so that one of
the electrodes rests above one of the animal's eyes thus sending more
of the total current through the hog's brain. It is essential for the success
of the stunning procedure that the tongs be constructed to ensure prompt
and close contact between electrodes and hog's head. A pair of Siemens
two-hand tongs was used in the Committee's experiments in Sore; these
differ only slightly from other existing two-hand tongs.

In the Committee's first experimental series, the electric stunning
technique was that which has been in use for a number of years at the
Sora Cooperative Slaughterhouse (referred to below as the routine method).
This technique is as follows: 85 volts of alternating current were applied
across the electrodes of the stunning tongs. (Between applications the
electrodes were dipped frequently in salt water).The stunning current
was applied for about 8 seconds on the average or until a certain degree
of relaxation of the animal was obtained. After the tongs were removed,
the animal was shackled to and raised on the sticking hoist and stock.
Since the average time between the removal of the tongs and sticking was
about 50 seconds, sticking was accomplished at the end of the clonic
phase or in the beginning of the comatose stage (see the section on the
physiological mechanism of electric stunning, page 6).

In view of the circulatory changes which occur in hogs during and
after electric stunning, the Committee considered it possible to reduce
or eliminate muscle hemorrhages incident to stunning by altering the
stunning and slaughtering technique to the end that sticking be accomgp-
lished» as soon as possible after termination of electrical stunning._
Information gained from a visit to the SCAN slaughterhouse, Angelholm,
Sweden, also pointed in this direction as did written information from
the chief veterinary officer, D.J. Anthony, M. R. C. V. S. (messrs. Marsh
and Baxter Ltd. , Brierly Hill, Staffs, England). The altered electric
stunning technique was therefore tried in the Committee's later experimen-
tal series. This method ’is referred to as the short interval method in the
tables of the report. The technique was that the stunner held the tongs on
the animal's head before and during shackling and the animal was stuck
immediately after removal of the tongs. With this method, the passage
of the current lasted on an average to 10 seconds and the interval between
removal of the tongs and sticking was, on the average, 5 seconds. Thus,
the animal was stuck before onset of the clonic phase (see the section on

the physiological action mechanism of electrical stunning page 6) .

Technical examination of the apparatus used heretofore:

From a study of the available information, it became clear to the
Committee at an early point that the extent of the damage attributed to
electric stunning was estimated differently by different slaughterhouses.
Since the various slaughterhouses use different equipment to carry out
electric stunning, the Committee considered it necessary to examine the
various types of stunning equipment in detail. The examination covered
the following equipment: (1) a converter (Kemp and Lauritzen) (2) a
transformer (Liibcke) (3) a stunning apparatus (Elther, not used in Denmark)
(4) stunning tongs (Siemens "sharp electrodes") (5) stunning tongs (Siemens
no. S. 36 "meat hammer electrodes"). The examination involved: Insulation
measurements, recording of the current and voltage characteristics of the
conVerter and transformer, determination of the‘current leakage to ground
from the converter and the transformer and, in the case of the Elther appara-

tus, a check of the meter readings. The insulation measurements showed

 

that all the insulation resistances were satisfactory for the converter,
transformer and tongs as long as they were dry (20 - 50 M52). After dipping
the electrodes in salt water - which is normal practice in using the tongs -
the insulation resistance, that is, the resistance between the electrodes

and the frame of the tongs, was unsatisfactorily low, often only 30 - 100 ohm.
As a consequence the frame of the stunning tongs conducted current during
use, deminishing the current ﬂow through the animal.

The reamaining electrical measurements showed no significant diffe-
rence between the various apparatus and need not be mentioned.

In view of the high humidity in the slaughterhouses, it can be said in
summary, that the investigations showed that all of the apparatus, even
though the are approved, are poorly constructed in principle. They offer
a risk to the stunner, especially if the insulation in the transformer should
fail, as well as wasting current.

The Committee would like to point out the danger that could be as-
sociated with using a transformer which has been in a damp place for a
long timt3.

The Committee sugests that the Ministry of Justice call the attention
of the Electricity Commission to the results of the Committee's investigations
of the equipment heretofore used so that it may take up the question for

renewed cons ide ration.

 




 

The Committee has designed stunning tongs without the above-mentio-
ned faults. The tongs were tested in practice and proved to be satisfactory,

especially with regard to their insulation resistance.

Physiological Mechanism of Electric Stunning.

Unconsciousness during electric stunning corresponds to the condition
during an epileptic fit and during electric shock treatments in humans.
The basis of the stunning effect is probably a stimulation of nerve cells
over a large area of the cortex and in deeper parts of the brain. This mass
activation manifests itself by, among other things, a contraction of all
muscles (including muscles of the eye). Preceding this convulsive activity
there are three phases. An initial brief phase is characterized by paralysis
of all muscles so that the hog can not maintain its normal position. Then
the so-called tonic phase appears less than one second after the beginning of
current flow; it is evidenced by sustained contraction of flexor and of extensor
muscles. Since the latter are the strongest, this phase of electrical stunning
manifests itself by an extension of the hog's front and hind legs. The tonic
phase lasts for about 10 seconds after the current has ceased. Following
the tonic phase is a brief period of 1 - 2 seconds when there is some degree
of relaxation of the muscles. After this there follows the so-called clonic
BEES. which consists of jerky,nearly rhythmic contractions such as walking-
like movements of the fore and hind legs. This phase lasts about 30 - 45
seconds. After the clonic phase ensues a period of generalized object muscle
paralysis, the so-called comatose stage, after which the animal awakenS.

The question has been raised as to whether there really is unconscious-
ness with electric stunning or whether the muscles are paralyzed while the
animal retains full consciousness. That during and after electric shock
hogs do not feel pain can be judged from the animal's general reactions and
from reports of persons who have been given electric shock. With regard
to the animal's reaction during electric stunning, there is no doubt that it
does not respond to external stimuli, that is, it seems to be unconscious.
A more ObjeCtiVe way of testing whether an animal is unconscious consists
of investigating whether an involuntary movement of the eyelids can be
evoked by 11011Chil'lg the cornea of the eye, as invariably occurs under normal
conditions (corneal reﬂex). The corneal reﬂex is absent as early as it has
been possible to test for it (that is, immediately after the tongs are removed

from the animal's head) and remains so for 1/2 to several minutes after




about 8 seconds' exposure to electric current. The absence of the corneal
reﬂex indicates deep narcosis in anesthetized humans. It can therefore be
concluded that the animal is unconscious from the beginning of electric

stunning until sticking.

MUSCLE AND LUNG HEMORRHAGES.

A series of experiments was planned to allow a statistical evaluation
of the frequency and nature of hemorrhages which appear in the muscles
and lungs during slaughtering, both in unstunned hogs and in hogs stunned

electrically by various techniques.

Muscle Hemorrhages
Punctate Hemorrhages in the Muscle

Bleeding in the flesh of slaughtered hogs may be punctate and patchy.
The so-called punctate hemorrhages are pinhead-to pea-sized, usually
slightly oval, dark bloody discolorations in the flesh. They are seen
especially in ham, belly and loin (back muscles) as illustrated in the
colour picture on page 9 . A very few may be restricted to a small area
or they may be scattered copiously over large areas of the carcass, A
microscopic examination of a number of muscle sections from stunned
hogs with punctate hemorrhages revealed that the bleeding was due to the
rupture of congested capillaries.

To determine the incidence of punctate hemorrhages in the flesh of
hogs slaughtered unstunned and stunned electrically by various techniques,
the Committee investigated several series of hogs slaughtered at the Sore
Cooperative Slaughterhouse. The accessible muscle surfaces on ham,
loin, and belly of the hog carcasses split down the back (split carcasses)

were examined immediately after slaughter.

The main results appear in table I.

In another series of hogs slaughtered at the Sora Slaughterhouse a
close examination was made of the hams cut off the carcasses for the
purpose of deboning and preparing them for canning at A/S Plumrose's
canning plant in Copenhagen. For deboning, every ham is cut up into
4 or 5 pieces. This procedure allowed a detailed examination of the ham
since each single piece could be examined on all sides. The punctate
homorrhages were counted; more than 10 in each cut up ham was

considered to be deleterious. The main results are shown in table II.

In summary, the examinations showed:

In the case of split carcasses, punctate muscle hemorrhages were

 

found more often in hogs stunned electrically by the routine method
(incidence 8. 3 %) than in unstunned hogs (incidence 5.6 ‘70). In most the
hemorrhages were slight and without practical significance. Seriously
deleterious punctate hemorrhaﬁs occurred only in hogs stunned electrically
by the routine method (incidence 0. 8 ‘70).

In the case of cut up hams, deleterious punctate hemorrhages (more
than 10 per ham) occurred only in hogs stunned electrically by the routine

method (incidence 5.1 ‘70).

When electric stunning was accomplished by the altered technique (short

interval, that is, at the most 5 seconds between the removal of the tongs

and sticking), and there was no real difference in their incidence in

electrically stunned and unstunned hogs.

Diffuse Muscle Hemorrhages

In addition to the punctate hemorrhages, so-called diffuse bleedings
may occur in the ﬂesh of slaughtered hogs. The diffuse bleedings differ
from the punctate hemorrhages in their irregular patchy shape and in that
they appear singly in certain characteristic places, for example, on the
inner side of hams and in the pelvis. They are large dark bruises from
Z to 5 cm in diameter, sometimes larger. The diffuse bleedings are
effusions of blood which occur as the result of severe traumatic tearing
or rupture of the tissues. Such insults occur during transport and loading
of the animals or during shackling and hoisting. The largest diffuse
bleedings are due to tearing of the ligament and joint capsule in the hip
joint during hoisting; indeed the femur by which the hog is shackled may
sometimes be broken.

Diffuse bleedings are not assumed to .have any connection with elec-
trical stunning. Nonetheless the Committee recorded the frequency of

occurrence of diffuse bleedings, as shown in tables V and VI.

LUNG HEMORRHAGES

The results of the Committee's investigations on this point can be

summa riz ed as follows:

Punctate or diffuse hemorrhages in the lungs, varying in severity,
were observed in about 25% of the lungs of electrically stunned hogs.
The majority of the cases were, however, slight. In the lungs of
unstunned hogs, only slight bleedings were found in only a few cases.
The change in the electrical stunning technique mentioned above, with
the reduced interval between the termination of the stunning and sticking,
did not reduce the number of lung bleedings, but rather the frequency
seemed to be increased.

However, great importance cannot be attached to lung hemorrhages

when the practicability of electric stunning is in question.

The Physiological Basis for the Occurence of Muscle and Lung

Hemorrhages in Electric Stunning

With respect to so-called diffuse bleedings, there is hardly any
doubt that they are due to trauma during transport and slaughtering and
that electric stunning is irrelevant. With regard to lung and punctate

hemorrhages, these must be considered to be due to rupture of the capillary

 

walls, probably as a result of increased venous or intracapillary (and arterial)
pressure. Blood circulatory changes caused by electric stunning must
therefore be considered of decisive importance in their causation. Only
a few experiments have been carried out on hogs with regard to this special
problem, but experiments on other animals should clarify the problem
sufficiently.

The current flow through the hog's brain stimulates its deeper as
well as its superficial centers, including the blood pressure regulating
center in the medulla oblongaﬂ. The first effect is to reduce cardiac
output by stimulation of the inhibitory nerves to the heart. Cardiac output
is further impaired by the pronounced increase in intrathoracic pressure
caused by the tonic contration (see page 6) in abdominal and chest muscles.
Furthermore, the generalized tonic convulsions express the blood from the
muscle capillaries and increase the volume of blood in the large veins near
the heart. This venous congestion, combined with the decreased cardiac

output, results in an increase in venous pressure to more than double the

 




 

14

normal. Similarly the arterial blood pressure increases temporarily to
about double the normal. The increase in arterial pressure is due to
contraction of the small arteries (arterioles) to increase the resistance
to flow in the arterial system. Due to the reduction in cardiac output,
this increase in arterial blood pressure is not seen until after about 10
seconds have passed.

Since the capillaries of the muscles are occluded during the tonic
phase, rupture of their walls and bleeding is unlikely during that period.
In the clonic phase, on the other hand, when the muscles alternately
contract and relax, the blood can pass through certain areas of the
capillary bed. Since the pressure in the venous capillaries has risen
to more than twice the normal level, the average pressure in a capillary
must increase to more than twice the normal if blood is to pass through.
Since the arterial blood pressure has also risen, the intracapillary
pressure in the muscles must be assumed to increase considerably during
the first part of the clonic phase. The likelihood for rupture of the
capillary walls is therefore greatly increased. It should be pointed out,
however, that electric stunning does not necessarily lead to rupture, but
that there must be a predi8posing element in certain hogs (unusually weak
capillary walls) since these hemorrhages occur so infrequently.

The changes in blood circulation mentioned above also account suf—
ficiently for the fact that lung hemorrhages are seen more frequently in
electrically stunned than in unstunned hogs. Furthermore the increase
in pulmonary venous pressure occurs at the beginning of electric stunning,
contrary to the case in the muscles, where the capillaries are not occluded
until the tonic phase; such a temporary "protective” mechanism is not
found in the lungs. In such a richly vascular organ as the lung, the chances
for rupture of the capillaries at one or another place is much greater than
in muscle, and the expected frequency of hemorrhages in the lungs is
correSpondingly higher.

The physiological considerations are thus in agreement with the
experimental results that multiple punctate hemorrhages can be provented
by use of the "short interval" method in electric stunning. As mentioned
above, the muscles are bloodless in the tonic phase, and the altered
circulatory conditions do not cause substantially increased intracapillary
preSSure until the beginning of the clonic phase. In the "short interval"
method, the animal is stuck before it enters the clonic phase, and the
pressure increase which otherwise would have overloaded the walls of

the capillaries, has not yet become manifest.




15

The Degree of Exsanguination and Muscle Rigidity.

Histological investigations carried out at the Pathological-Anatomical
Institute of the University of Copenhagen (Prosector Teilum) of muscle
samples from 15 unstunned and 15 stunned hogs indicated no difference
in the completeness of exsanguination in that no expansion or congestion
of the capillarybed was found either in unstunned or stunned hogs.

The degree of rigidity is mainly dependent on a series of factors

 

(the prior treatment of the animal, handling during transport and before
slaughter, etc.) which are irrelevant to electric stunning. In addition,
during its experiments the Committee heard no complaints from slaughter-
house personnel regarding muscle rigidity and this question has therefore

been of subordinate importance.

THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRIC STUNNING ON THE pH OF THE MEAT.

The question as to the inﬂuence of electric stunning on the pH and the
perishability of the meat has been of great interest to the meat industry.

On the basis of pH measurements made by the Danish Meat Research
Institute and investigations on the perishability of meat made by the Danish
Bacon Control - or according to lines laid down by it - it has been claimed
that electric stunning increases the perishability of the meat.

It is well-known that there is some connection betWeen the durability
of meat and its acidity (pH) in that an initially high pH often supports the
growth of certain bacteria, and in that decomposition is accompanied by
an increase in the pH of the meat. In attempting to determine the limits
0f pH which must be assumed to indicate increased perishability, due
consideration must be given to the significant variation in pH from animal
to animal, both in stunned and in unstunned hogs.

Measurements made during past years at the Danish Meat Research
Institute in Roskilde were said to show that the meat of electrically stunned
hogs (routine method) has a higher pH (0. 2 pH units) than meat from unstun-
ned hogs. On this basis it was concluded that the durability of meat from
electrically stunned hogs (was inferior to that from unstunned hogs. The
experiments were made by inserting a spear glass electrode directly into
the muscle.

The Committee made a number of preliminary measurements using the
same procedure. Ten measurements were made at different sites in each1n_.

guadriceps femoris examined to obtain an average pH. Split carcasses of

 




 

16

7 stunned and 7 unstunned hogs were used about 24 hours after sticking.
All 140 measurements were made on the same day and the results are
given in Appendix 1 (page Z3).Within one and the same muscle widely
varying pH values were found; the greatest difference was 1.4 pH units.
The average pH for the various hogs varied greatly; this holds true for
unstunned as well as stunned hogs, the standard deviation for stunned
animals being 0, 11 pH units, for unstunned animals 0, 24 pH units. The
average pH for unstunned hogs (70 measurements) was 5. 85 1' 0. 07 and
for stunned hogs (70 measurements) it was 5. 93 1' 0. 07. The difference
of 0. 08 pH units has accordingly a mean error of O. 10 pH units.

It can furthermore be calculated from the table that the standard
deviation of a single pH measurement with a spear electrode is, on the
average, 0. 2 pH units for both stunned and unstunned hogs.

Another way to determine the final pH of the meat is the so-called

macerate method. The meat is finely macerated and the pH measured

 

after the glycogen in the muscle has been broken down completely to
lactic acid (glycolysis).
The Committee made two series of experiments using the macerate

method. In a preliminary study the perishability of tenderloins (m. iliopsoag)

 

was tested chemically (see page 19). The series included 32 samples from
unstunned and 33 samples from electrically stunned hogs (short interval
method). The measurements showed an average pH of 5.61 L." 0. 04 for
stunned hogs and 5. 50 i 0. 02 for unstunned hogs (see Appendix 2).

However, the results of this experiment cannot be considered conclusive
in an evaluation of the inﬂuence of electric stunning on pH of the meat:
(a) the number of measurements in each of the two groups was small
(32 and 33). (b) the experiment was made under conditions where one
did not aim at the precision which later proved to be necessary. (c) pH
measurements were made between 0 and 2 hours after maceration and no
successive measurements were made to insure that a stationary pH was
achieved by this technique.

The Committee therefore made another series of measurements:

Since the problem of perishability is more actual in the case of hams than
of tenderloins, this investigation was made on the m. gracilis of 473 hogs,
of which 224 were unstunned and 249 stunned (short interval method). In
order to have as unifOrm conditions as possible, the experiment was carried
out on a slaughtering lot from one day. The (slaughtered hogs were hung in

the chilling room of the slaughterhouse at 4 0C. overnight and muscle

samples containing no fat tissue were taken from the same area in each
muscle 20 hours after slaughter. Each sample was macerated immediately
after it was cut. The macerates were stored for 6 hours at 20 0C. , and
the pH was then measured. The pH measurements were doubly checked
since each sample was divided into two and measured simultaneously by
two persons who observed all of the rules necessary to achieve as precise
measurements as possbile. If the two measurements differed by more
than 0. 04 pH units, they'were rejected and the pH of the divided sample
redetermined. The results of this investigation of pH in the macerate

were as follows:

(a) electrically stunned hogs (short interval method)

 

Average value for 249 macerates, pH - 5.47
Standard deviation: 0. 14 pH units

Standard error of the mean 0. 01 pH units.

(b) unstunned hogs

 

Average value for 224 macerates, pH 0 5.48
Standard deviation: 0. 13 pH units

Standard error of the mean 0. 01 pH units.

The difference between the two average values is 0. 01 pH units and
has a standard deviation of 0. 013 pH units. Consequently, there is no
statistically significant difference in average pH of muscles from electrically
stunned and unstunned hogs.

The experiment thus gave the unequivocal result that the pH of macera-
tes 0f hams (m. gracilis) from unstunned and stunned h0g8 was the same.
It should furthermore be mentioned that in almost all cases the meat samples
were divided into two and the part that was not used in the main experiment
was placed in cold storage at the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Royal
Agricultural College. Here the samples were macerated two days after
slaughter in groups of 20 pieces and the pH of the macerates was again
measured. The results showed that the average value of the pH for un-
stunned hogs was 5.46 and for stunned 5.45. Thus the pH of the macerates
did not change during storage for an additional day. For a more detailed
description of the experiment refer to Appendices 3 and 4.

With pH (measured by the macerate method) as an indication of perish-
ability, no difference in the perishability of ham (m. gracilis) of stunned
and of unstunned hogs could be demonstrated in the present series of

experiments.

THE INFLUENCE OF ELECTRIC STUNNING ON

THE PERISHABILITY OF MEAT.

Two series of experiments were made to evaluate the perishability
of fresh meat from electrically stunned and unstunned hogs. In the one
an organoleptic evaluation was made of the freshness of the meat, that is,
an evaluation on the basis of appearance and odor. In the other series
ammonia which increases in amount during spoilage, was determined as the

sum of volatile nitrogen compounds liberated by distillation with magnesia.

Organoleptic Tests for Spoilage of Fresh Hog Carcasses.

Forty pork sides, 20 from unstunned and 20 from electrically stunned
hogs (short interval method, slaughtered under observation at the slaughter-
house in Sore) were taken the day after slaughtering to a cold storage room
at A/S Cold Stores, Islands Brygge. The cold storage room was maintained
at + 10 to 12 C)C. with a relative air humidity of about 93 “/0.

After 2, 4, 5, and 6'days' storage under these conditions, the appear“
ance and odor of the pork were evaluated by the Committee and independently
by an inspector from the Danish Bacon Control. The latter classified the
meat according to the point scale from 10 (best) to 0 (poorest) which is
used by the Bacon Control. In 6 cases double evaluations were made and
differences of up to 3 points for the same hog appeared. The Committee
itself used an ordinary description of the condition (odor, color, slime
formation) along the lines used by veterinary meat inspectors in evaluating
the freshness of a carcass. The average results of the evaluations are

given in the summary below:

1: evaluation after 2 days' storage
All pork sides fresh.

2: evaluation after 4 days' storage
a: The Bacon Control's evaluation:
Unstunned 7 points
Electrically stunned 7 points
b: The Committee's evaluation:
Unstunned 15 without bad marks 5 with bad marks
. Electrically stunned l6 " " " 4 " " "




19

3: evaluation after 5 days' storage
a: The Bacon Control's evaluation
Unstunned 5 points

Electrically stunned 5 points

b: The Committee's evaluation:
all sides show signs of beginning superficial spoilage, more
noticeable in the neck and along the breastbone. Condition
very uniform. The sides which gave the poorest impression
with regard to odor and slime formation were selected jointly.

Of the 8 selected, 4 were unstunned and 4 electrically stunned.

4: evaluation after 6 days' storage
superficial Spoilage more advanced, the pork still usable,
however, after trimming. All of the sides were laid up beside

one another and sorted according to freshnesss into three groups:

Unstunned Electrically stunned
: poorest group 2 3
: not so poor group 7 6
3: best group 11 11

The difference between groups 2 and 3 is doubtful, and since the experiment
approached the point where continuation would wipe out all differences in
freshness, the experiment was discontinued. Deep spoilage was not found
in any of the sides examined.

The experiment shows that, under the deliberately chosen unfavorable
storage conditions, no difference could be demonstrated with regard to the
durability of the fresh pork in the two groups of unstunned and electrically

stunned hogs, by either the Committee's or the Bacon Control's evaluation.

Evaluation of the perishability of the meat through determination of

”ammonia" formation at constant temperature.

Evaluation of the keeping quality of the meat by organoleptic tests is
burdened with the faults connected with any method which is based on a
subjective estimation. Therefore, it was considered essential that the
direct organoleptic investigation be supplemented by a method which was
based on objective criteria. Such a method is the determination of the

amount of "ammonia" which, under well-defined conditions, develops

 




 

 

 

20

with time in the meat. "Ammonia" nitrogen originates from the break—
down of the proteins of the meat as a result of spoilage, and the quantity
of "ammonia" nitrogen represents therefore a measure of the degree of
spoilage of the meat.

The meat (in this series of experiments tenderloins) was taken
asceptically from the slaughtered hogs immediately after slaughter; all
of the subsequent handling of the meat was done under adequate asceptic
conditions. The meat was ground and stored at + 10 0C. At the time the
meat was ground the first measurements were made: a determination of
the dry matter and "ammonia" and pH determinations. During the subsequent
storage of the meat, "ammonia" and pH were measured at 6 and 8 days and.
thereafter at intervals depending on the condition of the’meat. In all, 65
tenderloins were investigated, some from stunned ("short interval") and
some from unstunned hogs.

Approximately the first half of the material was required to perfect
the technique and during this time it was observed that the changes in the
meat were of three types, presumably determined by the type of infecting

microorganism. The types of changes can be described briefly as follows:

a: surface light red, glistening, later darker, slimy and very damp.
Relatively quick development of evil-smelling substances; increase

in "ammonia" formation and in pH.

b: surface red, dry; only slight development of evil-smelling substances;

slight increase in "ammonia" and in pH after about 8 days.

c: surface grey, dry to slightly damp. No development of evil-smelling
substances; pH constant or decreasing and increasing only after a

O . I. O I 0
long time, ammonia" increases very slowly, even after a long time.

Technically it was only possible to carry out the investigations on the
samples, in all 14, which belong to category a; of these, 7 came from
stunned and 7 from unstunned hogs. At the time of grinding of the meat,
the "ammonia" content was approximately 0. 07 % of the dry weight of the
meat and remained approximately constant during the first days of storage.
After about 7 - 9 days, a "critical" time, "ammonia" formation suddenly
increased sharply, so that in the course of the following 2 days it amounted
to approximately ten times the inital value. At the "critical" time the meat

started to smell bad. The pH increased during the following days up to
about 8.




21

A well-defined objective measurements for the time the meat
remained in a satisfactory state of preservation was the time elapsed
from grinding to the "critical" time, For the 7 samples from unstunned
hogs, the average time was 179 f 3 hours and from the 7 samples from

stunned hogs it was 168 1' 9 hours. Thus the Committee did not demonstrate

 

any difference in the perishability of meat from stunned and unstunned hogs.

 

CONCLUSIONS.

 

(1) The Committee has no doubt that the slaughterhouses have had a
problem with regard to muscle hemorrhages consequent to electric stunning.
Deleterious punctate hemorrhages also appeared in the Committee's
material; punctate hemorrhages were found in 3 of 385 Split carcasses of
hogs stunned electrically by the method used heretofore, and deleterious
hemorrhages were found in 4 af 79 cut up hams from hogs stunned by the
same technique. In no instance were such hemorrhages observed in the

meat of unstunned hogs.

(Z) The Committee's investigations have shown that deleterious punctate
hemorrhages in the muscles can be avoided if the time interval between

the interruption of current flow and sticking is reduced substantially, from
about 50 seconds to about 5 seconds. It should be pointed out that the success
of this new electrical stunning technique is dependent on its being carried out

precisely as described.

(3) It must be assumed that the electrically stunned hog is unconscious

during the whole period from the beginning of current flow until it is stuck.

(4) The diffuse hemorrhages appear equally often whether the animal is
stunned or not. This is true both when stunning was carried out by the
routine method and when the now recommended "short interval" method

was used.

(5) The stunning tongs used at present should be replaced by tongs having
a frame of insulating material. The stunning apparatus used hitherto can,
in the Committee's opinion, hold some risk for the user under certain
conditions. The Committee suggests that the attention of the Electricity
Commission be called to the results of the Committee's investigations of
the apparatus used heretofore so that the question can be taken up for

renewed cons ide ration.

 




 

 

 

 

.22

(6) The Committee's investigations with the use of the short interval
method have given the unequivocal result that the pH in macerate of

m. gracilis from hams from unstunned and stunned hogs was the same.
Using pH as an indication of perishability the Committee concludes that,
in the present series of experiments, no difference could be demonstrated

in the perishability of meat from stunned and unstunned hogs.

(7) The Committee did not find any difference by organoleptic and chemical

investigations in the perishability of meat from stunned'and unstunned hogs.

Distribution of pH values in Muscle Macerates from Electrically

Stunned and Unstunned Hogs. (Experiment carried out at the Sore

 

Cooperative Slaughterhouse, April 24, 1956).

In April 1956 the Committee decided to undertake a new experiment
concerning the question of the inﬂuence of electrical stunning on the pH
of the meat of slaughtered hogs.

As a result of the fact that the direct pH measurements (with a spear
shaped glass electrode inserted in the muscle) had ShOWn great variation
within the same muscle, it was considered necessary to use muscle
macerates for pH evaluations. From previous experience concerning
the spread of the measurements, it could be estimated that it would
require at least 160 measurements within each group to show a difference
in pH of the order of 0. 1.

The Danish Meat Research Institute pointed out that the measurements
should be made on Split carcasses after they had been in cold storage for
a day (at a temperature of about 2 C)C). To obtain the greatest possible
uniformity of the material, it was decided to carry out the experiment on
hogs slaughtered on the same day. The hogs were slaughtered under proper
control on Monday, April 23, 1956 and the pH measured the next day,
Thueday, April 24, 1956. To carry out such an extensive experiment on
one day, it was necessary to employ a considerable number of participants

(in all 18) in the experiment. Prior to the experiment a detailed plan was

 




 

 

 

 

26

worked out and given to each of the participants so that all were familiar
with the procedure. In addition, certain preliminary measurements

were made.

Procedure:
1. Slaughtering Day (Monday, April 23).

The hogs were slaughtered with and without prior electric stunning
in groups of 20 at a time. The hogs were marked on the hams with
tattooing tongs (0 for electrically stunned and 1 for unstunned) while in
the pen prior to sticking. In order to make sure that all of the hogs
were properly marked and to make it easy for the stunning personnel to
find out which treatment each hog should be given, every hog was painted
with a color at the same time that it was tattooed (red-electric stunning;
green-no stunning).

An observer familiar with the correct procedure for the ”short inter-
val” method was placed in the sticking pen. All of the hogs which, for
some reason or other were not stunned according to the rules were marked
by the sticker by a cut in the ear and excluded. Hogs which were thought
to be sick on arrival in the sticking pen were also marked with an ear slit.
When the carcasses were weighed, all those having a cut on one ear were
sorted out, along with those found to be faulty by veterinary inspection.
All these hogs were placed in a special place in the chilling room so that

they would not be included in the material the next day.

2. Measuring Day (Thuesday, April 24, 1956).

The experiment began at 6 a.m. The meat samples were cut out in
the slaughterhouse at the place where the pork sides are laid on the
trimming belt. The samples, about 30 g of muscle, were cut from
m. gracilis in the ham by one of the members of the Committee. The
latter had an assistant to find the tattoo markings (0 or 1) on the hogs.
The sample was, as far as possible, taken from the same place in the
muscle and any fatty tissue was avoided. Muscles with diffuse bleeding
were not included. The piece cut out was laid on a piece of imitation
parchment paper 15 x 15 cm on which the tattooing mark was written.
The meat samples were handled as follows: Every sample was trimmed
so that it weighed approximately 20 gm. The remaining part was wrapped

and. put aside for later use. The piece weighing 20 gm. was cut up into

strips a couple of mm thick, weighed on a scale, placed with 1 1/2 times
its weight of distilled water in a Waring blender and macerated for 1 1/2.
min. It had been ascertained in advance that complete homogenization of
the meat was possible within this time and that the treatment in the blender
did not cause any noteworthy increase in the temperature of the macerate.
When maceration was completed, the homogenized meat sample was emp-
tied into a 100 m1 beaker. This part of the experiment ran from 6 to 11 a.m.
during which time approximately 500 samples were macerated by 12 persons.
The finished macerates stood at 20 0C. for at least 6 hours before the pH
was measured with glass electrodes and four pH meters (Radiometer pH-MZZ).
The pH meters had been left on over night and were stable at the beginning
of the measurements. To guard against possible errors a double determination
was made on every sample: Before being measured, the macerate was care-
fully stirred with a clean spatula, emptied into two measuring ‘beakers and the
two samples were measured separately on two pH meters. A common standard
buffer solution (5. 50) was used to adjust the four pH meters. Records were
taken separately for each glass electrode and the code of the macerate (0 og 1),
the time of macerating as well as the time of measuring the pH were noted.

In case of deviations between the double determinations of more than
0. 04 pH unit the pH meter was checked and adjusted and the measurements
repeated. In this way the variation in the parallel tests did not exceed the
limits mentioned above except in one case. In this one case where, because
of an unexplainable reason, this was not possible, the measurement was
discarded. After each measurement the glass electrode was cleaned carefully
with distilled water and the KCl in the calomel electrode was renewed. After
every tenth measurement all of the pH meters were checked and adjusted
even if some of them had already been adjusted within this interval. This
part of the experiment began at 12:30 and was completed by about 10:00 p.m.

Fourteen persons took part in the experiment and all were thoroughly familiar

with the technique.

Results.

The results are tabulated in table 1 and 2; each value is an average of
the double determinations. As mentioned above, a deviation of 0.. 04 pH unit
was allowed between the single values of the double determinations. The
error of the individual measurement is therefore about 0. 02 pH unit. In the

tables the measurements are grouped into class intervals of 0. 05 pH unit.

 




 

 

 

28

In the first column (x) is given the average of each class interval. In the
second column is given the number of measurements (nf) which fall within
the particular class interval. In treating the material 5.47 was chosen as
a suitable arbitrary mean value and the deviations (x) of each class from
5.47 are given in the third column. In the fourth (nfx) and fifth (nfxz)
columns are given the first and second moment of each class interval with
regard to x - 5.47. The mean value (m1), standard deviation (S.D.) and

the standard error of the mean (e(m1)) are given below the two tables.
The results were:

I; stunned hogs:

 

Average value for 249 macerates, pH - 5.466
Standard deviation: 0. 136 pH unit
Standard error of the mean: 0. 009 pH unit

II: unstunned hogs:

 

Average value for 224 macerates, pH - 5.478
Standard deviation: 0. 133 pH unit I
Standard error of the mean: 0. 009 pH unit

The difference between the average values is 0. 012 pH unit and has a

standard deviation of 0. 013 pH unit. Hence the two distributions of the

 

pH values of the macerates from unstunned and stunned hogs do not differ

significantly from each other with regard to mean value and standard

deviation.

In the above calculations the material was grouped into class inter-
vals of 0. 05 pH unit. In addition, the mean value and standard deviation
were calculated directly since it might be supposed that the grouping could
cause small deviations. However, the grouping in the class intervals of

0. 05 pH unit did not inﬂuence the results, since the calculations without

previous grouping give:

(a) stunned hogs: m 5.446, S.D. = 0.0135

5.479, S.D. = 0.0134

In the final results only two decimals should be used.

(b) unstunned hogs: m




29

The histogram (fig. 1) below shows the frequency distribution of pH
in the two groups. Since the maximum degree of uncertainty was 0. 02 pH
units, it seemed reasonable to use a class interval of O. 1 pH unit (5 x the
maximum degree of uncertainty). As to be expected there was no significant
difference in the two distributions. In addition, the two distributions have
been compared with the normal distribution by plotting the cumulative
frequency as a function of pH. This is shown in fig. 2. The course of the
two was identical and for pH lower than 5. 65 corresponding to about 92 %
of the findings, the two distributions are normally Spread.

As mentioned above, the samples were divided into two parts before
weighing and twenty samples of each group, not macerated for the original
pH measurement, were collected and their pH was measured two days after
slaughter.

After the addition of 1 1/2 times its weight of distilled water, the large
samples were macerated for 1 minute in a Waring blender and kept for
8 - 10 hours at 20 0C. befOre the pH was measured. The results are given

in table 4 below.

APS Ch 4 UDC 637.513.22

Report of the Committee on Slaughtering Methods Appointed by the Danish
Academy of Technical Sciences at the Bequest of the Jilinistry of Justice.
Acta Polytechnica Seandinavica (Acta P. 264/1959), Chemistry including
Metallurgy Series 4, Copenhagen 1959, 35 pp. SW. Kr. 7.00.

The report contains in a summarizing form the committee’s investigations on the
effect of electric stunning on the quality of pork, particularly whether electric stun-
ning could cause hemorrhages in the ham, loin and belly and in general more perish-
able meat.

It is shown that deleterious punctate hemorrhages in the muscles can be avoided if
the time interval between the interruption of current ﬂow and sticking is reduced to
about 5 sec. Organoleptic and chemical investigations showed no difference in the
perishability of the meat from stunned and unstunned hogs. The pH in macerate of
m. gracilis from hams from unstunned and stunned hogs was the same.

Dear Mrs. Draper:

YOur letter of November 27th was received by us
this morning requesting information about our PRESCO LEKTRO—
STUN. Enclosed you will find a reprint of an article that
appeared in the National Provisioner along with a technical
bulletin that we have put out. We are in the process of
printing a brochure that not only describes the application
of the PRESCO LEKTRO-STUN but also will give a picture story
of how the instrument is employed.

We have spent many years of research on the sub-
ject of electrical stunning and the PRESCO LEKTRO~STUN is
the result of the experimentation that we have done. As you
can see from the enclosed reprint, the PRESCO'LEKTRO~STUN
has been in use at the Reliable Packing Company for approxi—
mately a year. They have been able to achieve excellent re-
sults with it, and we feel that our equipment is the safest
and the most economical piece of electrical stunning ap~
paratus that is currently on the market. We also feel that
it is more humane to render animals unconscious by the means
of inducing an electrical shock than to suffocate them and
render them unconscious by using the 002 gas.

Our equipment is economical to use, as it can be
operated for about the same cost as a television set. The
initial cost is also a great deal lower than the 002
chambers, as it is our understanding that they start at about
$13,000. and run up to astronomical figures depending on the
size of the installation. We also are not concerned with an

installation cost, as the power pack can be plugged into a
regular 110 volt wall socket.

We trust that the information that we have fur~
nished will be sufficient for your purpose, but in the
event additional information is needed we will be only too
willing to supply it upon request. 'We also want to inform
you that if there is any way we can assist you regarding
any phase of the humane slaughter act, that you should not
hesitate to get in touch with us as we will be only too will-
ing to help you if we can.

Cordially yours,

its connecting cable and a Power Cableo

      
   
 
     
   
   
   
   
         
   

The Power Cable is a rubber covered 4 wire conductorg
On one end is a 3 prong Twist Lock Male Connector which plugo
into a 110 volt 60 cycle electrical outlet“ Two wires of the
above cable are connected to the ground prong of this connectore
At the other end of the cable is a 4-wire polarized female cone

As you will nOte, the plugs on the end of the tnwer
Supply cable and the cable connecting the Stunner have a round
hole in then located to one side of the centere This nnie
fits over a corresponding pin in the receptnnle lonnted on the
Power Supply so that the plugs can be inserted only in one
nositiono

The A pole receptacle for the 110 volt table is on
the left hand side (facing the front) of the Power Supply Unite
The 8 pole receptncles on either side are connection for the
Stunner. This is for the operator's convenience, as only one
Stunner can be operated from the Power Supplya

ontinuous in—line conveyorized

electrical stunning of hogs is

being practiced at the Reli—
able Packing Co. of Chicago, a lead-
ing independent pork processor.
Hogs are stunned electrically with
a controlled charge as they are con-
veyed past a stunning station. There
is no temporary holding or restrain-
ing to permit administration of the
charge to the animal.

The equipment has been used to
attain a slaughter rate of 275 hogs
per hour, and will be operated at
450 head per hour when it is fully
blended into Reliable’s production
line, reports president John E.
Thompson. The only changes to be
made in the installation at that time
will be the replacement of the pres-
ent 21/2-hp. motor for driving the
conveyor with a 5-hp. unit, and the
setting of the stunning conveyor on
a slight incline.

The method being employed at
the Reliable plant, which is said
to possess the important advantage
of giving the stunning operator a
Wide latitude in the placement of
the electrodes, can be adapted to vir-
tually any hog dressing line, and
even to those handling as high as 650

 

head per hour. The maximum
tion for administration of tl‘itxﬁi «ﬁg: 1":-
ning charge to a hog is two sszze;:ty:.:g:»a
and this long a period is FEiﬁZT‘Iiﬂ‘szfi
only for animals in the 400-113. :::::,..2.r_a;:;‘:;x
according to Fred DiPasqualza:,
perintendent of hog slaughtering
erations at Reliable.

One advantage of the techstrata-.7:
employed at the Chicago plant
that the operator can stop the r
ministration of the electrical charge
as soon as he sees and feels the ani
mal going limp under it—a circum—
stance which may occur after ant};
1/20 second in the case of lighter
hogs, reports Dr. Hugo Wistreich,
research and development director
for Reliable. When the hog goes limp
the stunner releases the trigger
switch, lifts the electrodes from the
head and is ready for the next ani-
mal. The stunning time required for
each hog is determined by his indi—
vidual resistance to the current.

The system has been used to stun
about 6,000 animals. With the excep—
tion of lung hemorrhaging of slight
extent found in about 10 per cent
of the hogs, the organs and muscles
of the animals have not been dam-
aged by electrical stunning. Dr.




 

Wistreich believes that when the
unit is installed per plan in the pro-
duction line, the percentage of lung
hemorrhages will be reduced. The
stunned animals now are lifted, after
the hangoff, by a slow hoist from the
first floor to the third level dressing
department where they are stuck.
The ideal time to dispatch the hog
is; immediately upon his entry into
tl::e relaxed phase after stunning, or
approximately 4 to 6 seconds after
shaming, says Dr. Wistreich. He ob-
serves that the hog goes through
Linen phases before recovering con-
.s:::*:%.:::.:sness in about 150 seconds. He
l':.:‘-;~;-:i: goes limp under the impact of
sight: stunning charge, he then con-
vazises and finally relaxes and re-
it“: in this state of relaxed im-
mobility until he recovers conscious-
£15335. The ideal time to stick the
EMEti‘i’ial is while he is relaxed since
4* sticker is not compelled to
s:_::::a.dy a quivering limb or hog. Re-
i.:i,::.:-i::ir~3 will dispatch the hog during
n interval in its production in-
staiiiation.

The Reliable installation, which is
the- outgrowth of experiments with
:.r’;.-‘.~:::*ir::us electrical and holding de-
vices (see THE NATIONAL PROVISION-
.m: :33?" January 24, 1959) to devel-
oiggt: humane methods, has as its prin-
cipzﬁ. pieces of equipment an in—line
feed conveyor designed to restrain
the hogs as they are being con-
veyed, the stunner and an electrical
Céi:.;i"ri.r0l box. The latter two pieces of
equipment have been developed in
::::::::'.::;,;e1“ati0n with Preservaline Man-
ufacturing Co., Flemington, N.J.,
sub holds the exclusive sale and
midrchandising rights. The equip—
rmnt is being offered to the indus-
try under the trade name “Presco
Lektro—Stun.”

Tim hogs are driven from the
holding pens into the 32—ft.—long
stunning conveyor. The conveyor
has metal side walls 4 ft. high which
are solid because it was found that
it was easier to drive hogs onto
the moving conveyor slats when
there were no distracting lights on
the sides. The wall construction is
such that it restrains the hog’s side-
wise movements. The width at the
bottom of the conveyor passage, up
to about the hock of the average
hog, is 8 in., and the average hog
cannot easily turn around once he
is on the conveyor. Following a “Y”
pattern, the walls then flare out to
24 in. to accommodate the sides of
the average hog and gradually in-
crease to 30 in. at the top. The
greater width at the top permits the
drover to contact the hog more
readily with his prod and the stun—
ner with his instrument.

The restraining width of the lower

“missed” hogs from passing into the
hangoff section.

While on the conveyor the hog is
moved past the station Where the
operator administers the stunning
charge. The handle of the stunning
instrument is triangular in shape
with one leg extending to the point
from which the applicator head juts
at an angle. Each of the two elec-
trodes in the head consists of a series

 

of needles of the same type as is
used in tatooing live hogs; they can
be replaced easily when they be-
come dull through use. The grip
carries an on-and-off switch and
a red blinker to warn the operator
that the current is on. The base of
the grip has a trigger switch which
the operator must depress before
the charge is transmitted from the
control box through the instrument
to the hog. The operator stands on
a wooden platform and wears rub-
ber gloves. The entire conveyor is
grounded.

The operator stands parallel to
the conveyor and as the hog passes
his station he applies the electrodes
to the animal’s head. Any area
on the head will do, down by the
jowl or up by the ears, but contact
must be made with the head so that
the current is transmitted to the ani-
mal’s brain. The operator does not
face the hogs; he sees them as their
heads emerge into his area of vision.
Since he is not required to position
the applicator carefully, he can
easily and unhurriedly administer
the charge to any number of hogs,
says DiPasquale.

The needles penetrate the skin
of the head and make good contact
with the hog. The pressure from the
normal downswing is sufficient to
make the required penetration.

The operator can terminate the
stunning charge whenever he no-
tices that the hog has gone limp
and he need not wait out the full
preset time. This fact permits the
stunning of hogs of almost every size
from small pigs to large breeding
animals. However, in normal opera-
tion the animals are pre-sorted and
the controls on the electrical box are
adjusted for voltage and time inter-
val to be employed. Reliable offi-
cials point out that the equipment
can be used to stun any size ani-




mal and a limited amount of work
has been done with cattle. This ex-
perimental work indicated that the
technique might be adapted for use
on beef animals.

The current administered to the
hog is regulated through the Presco
control box which is plugged into
a standard llO-volt a.c. outlet. The
box includes a rheostat through
which the stepped-up voltage is con-
trolled over the 300-Volt to 800-volt
practical range. The voltage is ad-
justed to the size of the animals
being stunned.

Production models of the box will
have the voltage increments cali—
brated in terms of hog weight. The
box has an on-and-off switch, a
blinking on light and a timer which
can be set for periods up to 3 sec—
onds. Management has found, how—
ever, that 2 seconds is sufficient to
stun even the largest hogs. There
is a dial for measuring the amperage
reaching the hog, discounting sur—
face and conductive losses, etc. The
amperage administered does not ex-
ceed 1.5, and the actual current
needed for stunning is often as low
as 5 milli-amps, according to Dr.
Wistreich.

Once the voltage and time inter-
val have been set, the control box
has a self—adjusting output trans-
former that compensates for varia—

tions within individual animals.
This, plus the trigger control on the
applicator, allows the unit to be used
on mixed hogs if need be. For ef-
ficient operation, however, it is rec-
ommended that the voltage be ad-
justed to hog size.

N o hog has been electrocuted dur-
ing all the experimental work, re-
ports Richmond Unwin, assistant to
the president, who has tabulated
the data on the experiments. Unwin
is a member of both the AMI and
the USDA humane slaughter com-
mittees.

The control box is placed on the
platform next to the operator who
makes the changes in time and volt—
age required as the various lots of
hogs are conveyed past him. The
unit is portable and can be moved
out of the way during cleanup. It
is sturdy and waterproof and has
required no maintenance during use,
states DiPasquale.

The carcasses and viscera from
the electrically stunned hogs have
been examined by a resident veter—
inarian who reports that the small
hemorrhages sometimes caused can
be detected readily and present no
major inspection problem. When
hemorrhages occur in the lungs due
to some pathological condition, oth—
er organs or body tissues usually are
affected also, he states. Even if a

lung should be damaged by the
electrical charge, there is no product
loss since lungs from hogs are not
used for human consumption.

The Reliable researchers, in co-
operation with Dr. Roy Morse,
chairman of the food science de-
partment, Rutgers University, who
has done a great deal of the basic
research involved in developing the
present stunning technique and
equipment, hope to automate com—
pletely the stunning operation. They
believe they have a solution to the
problem, says Thompson. If they are
successful, the present control box
will not be made obsolete, but will
be equipped with additional instru-
ments required.

The installation at Reliable Pack-

ing Co., excluding the cost of the
control box, but including the cost
of plant modifications required in
setting up the conveyor, cost $4,000,
reports Thompson.
Editors note: John E. Thompson,
president of Reliable, has extended
an invitation to those interested to
visit the Chicago plant and see the
electrical stunning method in 0p—
eration during the AMI Conven—
tion. He requests those desiring to
see the operation to get in touch
with Richmond Unwin, assistant to
the president, so that proper ar—
rangements can be made.

Several hundred persons from
all over the country will visit
the Sperry & Barnes Co. this
week to observe humane pig
slaughtering. '

For the past three months the
local plant has been stunning
pigs by electrical shock before
1they are killed.

I Robert D. Halcomb, plant
manager, ‘ said electrical stun-
ning method is not only more
humane, but may save quite a
bit of money for the industry.
- The new method was devel-
oped by Swift & Co., of which
Sperry & Barnes is a division,
to comply with a new federal
law on humane slaughtering.
Starting July 1, 1960, only com-
panies _wh_ose slaughtering

panies prefer to render the pigs
unconscious by carbon dioxide

Swift & Co. has also devel-
oped. a more humane method
of killing cattle. Instead of the
old-fashioned hammer, the com-
pany _recently adopted a new
“captive bolt” instrument that
made stunning surer and less
painful. Swift- was the first
manor packer to convert its
cattle slaughtering to this new
method.

present at the demonstration: to
be held from 9. to 11 am. to—
day through Thursday. , ‘
' Humane. associations haVe
long protested against the
slaughtering methods used by
most American meat packers. t
A‘ ,Vh‘umaneg slaughterin bill l
was introduced at the'lg" ”Gen- 1
eral' Assembly of Connecticut, 1
but the? lawmakers decided to }
,wait and see if state packers ‘
complied With the new federal
\law. 7 ‘ '
The» method used by most
packers today, and by Sperry
‘ until three months ago,'was to.
run the pig through a passage-;

 

 

 

 

way, clamp a steel shackle on?
one of its hind legs, .snatch the
pig into the air,‘ and cut its?
’throat as it hung squealing and
struggling. - " . p

The electrical stunning
method used by Sperry involves
three new principles. The pig
“is, first sent onto a ramp be—
tween two foam rubber pads.
These pads, called restrainers,
lift the "pig off the ramp and
hold it securely. An, operator
then applies an electrical in-
?strument to the pig’s head,
érendering it unconscious». The l
pig then passes onto a conveyor l
belt where its throat is. cut. The
whole operation takes less than 1
five seconds and the pig feels 1
nothing after the electrical l
shock. , . .

Besides being easier on the,
pigs, this, , method apparentlyg
results in fewer- internal bruises
on hams. . ;

“This may mean a‘maJori
saving for meat packers,” Hal-t
colm said. _ l

The new stunning ‘methodg
won’t affect the taste or ap—i

 

 

'pearance of the meat, he
added. . . l
Sperry & Barnes is New Eng-j

land’s largest supplier» of fresh
lpork products, and the only
federally inspected [me-at pack...
er in Connecticut. From sevenj
to .ten' thousand hogs , are.
shipped here‘ from Iowa each;
week. ArriVing‘" by ‘rail at night,3
they are usually slaughtered
the folloWing day. ‘l , g ‘

Halcomb pointed out that;
much of the‘fpork sold in New;
England is slaughtered in the
midwest and shipped here‘ inl
refrigerator. cars. ;

“It costs less to .ship a porki
loin than it does to ship a live,
pig,” he said. “However, porkl
slaughtered here has the ad-‘
vantage of freshness.”

Sperry ,& Barnes has long.
been famous for its top quality,l
New England - dress‘ed‘ porkl
products. .

, Halcomb said he. expected}
ithat most meat packers will}
adopt humane slaughteringt
methods shortly. The need. toi

XPERIMENTS with electrical stunning of hogs to
render them insensible to pain prior to sticking were
begun by John Engelhorn 8: Sons, pork packer of.

Newark, N. ]., on December 12, 1957, and late in 1958
the ﬁrm held a public demonstration of the technique
and equipment it has developed for humane slaughter.
Ninety hogs were stunned during the demonstration.

The chilled carcass meat was examined by veterinarians
of the federal Meat Inspection Division and others who
reported that the meat had good bloom, appeared better
bled and had no undesirable characteristics attributable
to the stunning method.

Three thousand hogs have been stunned electrically
since the Newark ﬁrm began its work and not one animal
has been condemned and no broken bones have been dis-
covered. During the initial experiments some of the lungs
were condemned because of petechiae (small crimson,
purple, or livid spots in the mucous and serous membranes,
caused by extravasation of blood). However, since that
time the veterinary inspectors have learned to distinguish
the petechiae caused by stunning and the equipment and
method have been modiﬁed to minimize this reaction. The
lungs are now passed by the inspectors unless there are
other signs that indicate a diseased condition.

Dr. L. W. Gaydosh, chief resident inspector of the Meat
Inspection Division, notes that one area that requires
further study is to determine what changes electrical stun-
ning may cause in the organs of diseased animals.

Data appearing in this article cover about 1,000 healthy
animals“. Some of the observations were made during the
public demonstration; others are reported by ofﬁcials of
the company and other participants in the research.

More than a year’s time and about $50,000 were spent
in developing the equipment and methods demonstrated at
the New Jersey plant, according to Fred Engelhorn, presi-
dent of the concern. The stunning apparatus, for which a
patent is pending, was worked out by the ﬁrm’s technical
adviser, Edgar E. Moss, who is an engineering graduate
of Cornell University and was formerly chief engineer for
Lever Bros.

In the development work the company had the assis-

tance of Dr. C. R. Hirschfeld, specialist in the ﬁeld of
electrotherapy and shock treatment for humans, and Dr.
Roy E. Morse, director of the department of food science,
Rutgers University. The electrical equipment, including
the control box and stunning prongs, was developed be-
cause commercial apparatus which was available was found
to be inadequate, according to Moss.

STUNNING SETUP: The experimental stunning setup
in the Engelhorn plant is relatively simple. It consists of
a chute which is 40 ft. long, 3 ft. high and 30 in. wide,
The last 20 ft. of the chute is ﬂoored with a powered belt
conveyor which travels through the squeeze box section.
The walls of the box are padded with cloth-covered foam
rubber. One of the sloping walls is air-powered to pro-
vide the “squeeze,” the other sloping wall is ﬁxed. Elec-

THE NATIONAL PROVISIONER, JANUARY 10, 1959

 




trical apparatus consists of the control box and the two-
pronged stunning tool.

Hogs are driven single file into the chute and arrive at
a vertical sliding gate. The operator feeds one animal at a
time through the gate onto the belt conveyor which has
an incline of about 10 deg. The hog travels on the con—
veyor into the squeeze box which is activated by the
stunning operator. The walls restrain the hog and lift his
feet free of the moving belt.

At this moment the operator applies the stunning instru-
ment—two needle-like electrodes yoked on a wooden base
with an insulated handle—to the hog’s forehead slightly
below the ear line and above the eyes. He presses the but—
ton in the tool’s handle which activates the control box
regulating the electrical charge. The 3/4 in. length of the
electrodes is great enough to clear the hair and penetrate
the skin slightly to make a good contact with the hog.

As the stunned animal goes limp the operator removes
the stunner and releases the squeeze box to allow the hog
to drop on the conveyor belt that carries him to a discharge
roller section on which he glides to the shackling station.
During stunning the hog becomes rigid, quivers (which
may include convulsive action such as kicking the feet)
and then relaxes. He remains in this relaxed and insensible
state for about 21/2 to 3 minutes, according to Moss. Dur-
ing the period of relaxed immobility he is completely
insensitive to pain, as was demonstrated by standard pain
tests administered by Dr. Hirschfeld.

Using the experimental installation at the Engelhorn
plant, 45 to 75 seconds were required to shackle the
immobile hog, lift him to the sticking area on the second
ﬂoor and dispatch him. The hog remains relaxed during
the sticking operation.

Engelhorn officials report that the incidence of internally-
bruised hams is as much as 80 per cent lower in the
electrically-stunned animals than in hogs shackled and
hoisted in the conventional manner. The estimate is based
on reports by the firm’s smoked meat and boning divisions.

RATE AND RESULTS: The company has attained a
stunning and slaughter rate of 250 head per hour with the
apparatus shown last week. President Engelhorn believes
that the system could handle up to 600 head per hour with
a single control box and stunner after improvement of the
conveyors and chutes and provision for prone bleeding.

The stunner and control box are not in commercial pro-
duction, but Moss estimates that the unit would cost about
$5,000. However, availability of the apparatus will depend
on whether Engelhorn can obtain approval of the method
from the Meat Inspection Division of the U. S. Department
of Agriculture. The inspection service has been supplied
with data covering 1,000 hogs stunned with the apparatus.
These observations by veterinarians cover healthy animals,
but do not include pathological studies of the meat or case
histories concerning diseased hogs.

Since a number of representatives from humane groups
were present at the demonstration, several hogs were
stunned and allowed to revive in the shackling area. On
awakening they walked about and grunted in a normal
manner. They were dispatched with the next lot.

HUMANE: Some of the humane representatives present
expressed positive opinions on the stunning technique. W.
A. Bender, chairman of the legislative committee, New
Jersey branch of the Humane Society of the United States,
described the method as a “great, very great improvement.”

William M. O’Crady, president of the same group, said
that he considered the method humane, and observed
further that it eliminated the principal objectionable feature
of the present hog slaughtering method, namely, the
shackling of conscious and mobile animals.

THE NATIONAL PROVISIONER, JANUARY TO, I959

LUNGS from electrically-stunned hogs are examined closely by
John C. Macfarlane, field director of New England Livestock Con-
servation. Inc.; Dr. L. W.’ Gaydosh. chief MID inspector at the Engel-
horn plant; Dr. A. R. Thiele. MID inspector in charge at Newark,
and Dr. Roy E. Morse. director of Rutgers' food science department.

ment, Massachusetts SPCA, commented that the technique
holds great promise and should be fully explored.

(Although doubts about the acceptability of electrical
stunning from the meat inspection standpoint may be re-
solved, it should also be remembered that the procedure
must be approved as a “humane” method under the new
law. There are indications that it will be examined care-
fully from this standpoint. See also page 50.)

The demonstration hogs were stunned, bled and de-
haired during the lunch period by a skeleton crew, and
consequently, were the first in line to be dressed when
the killing gang resumed work. The organs, andespecially
the lungs, of these animals were examined by the group.

Some of these lungs showed petechial hemorrhage,
characterized in most instances by a series of small red pin
points against the normal gray of the lung. The hem—
orrhage was more pronounced in a few cases and was a
purplish blue. While their observations are subject to
further investigation and clarification, both Dr. Caydosh
and the veterinary inspector on the line believe that they
can distinguish this condition as one attributable to
electrical stunning. They also state that if such hemorrhage
is due to a disease, such as hog cholera or pneumonia,
other evidence of the afﬂiction exists within. the lungs,
other organs and parts of the body.

Table 1 shows the numbers and percentages of lungs
condemned during the "ﬁrst 10 tests involving 228 hogs.
(These are Engelhorn’s “official” tests, although a number
of hogs are stunned electrically every day to increase the

company’s knowledge of the method and to permit reﬁne-
ment of the equipment.) The highest percentage of con-
demnations—72.8—occurred in the ﬁrst test, and in the
ﬁnal test all lungs were acceptable. The improvement is
attributed, in part, to changes in technique, as well as to
development of proficiency by the veterinary inspectors

in recognizing the petechiae caused by electrical stunning.

All the hogs were tagged and tattooed for the ﬁrst 10
tests. During the 11th test, with the permission of Dr.
Caydosh, the hogs were tattooed only to see what per-
centage of the hogs would be spotted by the inspectors
as having been affected by electrical stunning without their
knowledge of which ones had been so treated.

In a morning test 13 hogs were stunned and 10 cleared
the inspection undetected. Of the three sets of lungs
questioned, the ﬁrst two had well-marked petechiae, but
these were ﬁne and occurred only in spots. The third set
had extensive petechiae but still passed. Fourteen hogs
were stunned in the afternoon test and seven went by un-
detected. However, what was more interesting was the
fact that 12 hogs that had not been stunned were mis-
taken for stunned animals. Of the seven that were detected,
three had very ﬁne and slight petechiae; one had extensive
petechiae but the lungs were clean inside, and the re-
maining three had well-marked but faint petechiae.

Another interesting fact observed in this test was the
condition of the lungs of one hog which was stuck immedi-
atefy upon release from the squeeze box. (It normally
requires about 45 to 75 seconds for a hog to travel from
the squeeze box to the sticking station.) The hog stuck
immediately had spotless lungs. Engelhorn plans to explore
this area further.

The ﬁrm also conducted a preliminary examination of
the meat in connection with test No. 8. Loins, hams and
bellies were taken from 10 hogs. The loins were held for
three days and then carefully examined; the hams were
cured and smoked, and the bellies were cured, smoked
and sliced for bacon. The meat appeared to possess its
normal color, taste, appearance and keeping quality, reports
Moss. More work will be done in this area.

The ﬁrm then conducted a second series of tests in-
volving 212 animals; results are summarized in Table 2.
During this second test, in which 91 per cent of the hogs

had lungs which were normal or had only slight petechiae,
similar petechial conditions were observed in non-stunned
hogs. At times this percentage was high, states Moss.
In the ﬁnal test of the second series the hogs were stuck
immediately after stunning and the results were excellent.
Moss observes that in any electrical stunning operation
the objective should be to stick the hogs immediately.
The differences in the condition of the lungs of the hogs
stunned in the tests are attributable, in large measure, to
the variations in equipment and technique employed. In
developing its stunner, Engelhorn tested one commercial
model and developed four other types before obtaining
satisfactory results with the present model. The objective
is to deve10p a tool that is easy to apply and that will make
positive contact with the hog with minimum penetration.
The control box used by Engelhorn is the result of
work done with two commercial units and many modiﬁ-
cations in the model originally built at the plant. Modiﬁ-
cations in the control box grew out of experiments with
different types of current, the volume administered, the

duration of the stunning period, the peak attained, etc.
The ﬁrm tried out many different combinations of these
factors and studied the electrical current characteristics.

Alternating current, direct current, pulsating current
and various combinations thereof were tried. Best results
in terms of a minimum petechial condition were obtained
with a spike (pulsating direct) current which, when plotted
with an oscilloscope, has a series of narrow rectangular
bars that fall slightly below the positive line.

It was also determined that it is desirable to reach the
peak in a minimum of time. A peak current of 700 to 900
milliamperes is employed that gives a charge of 400 to 600
volts, depending
on the resistance
of the animal. The
peak charge to the
animal is attained
within 1/2 second
with a duration of
1 second. Moss
comments that the
peak and its tim-
ing require addi-
tional research.

The control box,
which includes a
convertor, a timer,
an interruptor and
an on—and-off light,
works from 110-
volt, 60—cycle, al-
ternating current.

The operator
wears rubber boots
and rubber gloves
within heavy duty
leather gloves. The
stunning device is
well insulated.

If the operator should make poor contact with the ani-
mal, as he does occasionally, he may have to restun it.
However, the animal seems to experience no pain since it
remains quiet in the squeeze box.

that the humane slaughter advisory committee appointed
by Secretary of Agriculture Benson will consider the results
of their work before making ﬁnal recommendations as to
the designation of humane slaughter methods.

Some Observations on the Electrical

Stunning oi Pigs

by SV. Mogens lllomquisl*

Extensive investigations on electrical stunning of pigs have been carried out in Denmark.
This is the ﬁrst of a series of articles summarising the results of the ﬁndings.

I. ELECTRICAL STUNNING EQUIP-
MENT AND ITS USE

Introduction

N many countries it has been

found desirable to introduce
some means of aneesthetising pigs
prior to their slaughter. This has
been for humane reasons, as it is
generally believed that shackling
and hoisting a pig by a hind leg
with an iron chain before sticking
is very painful to the animal. It
therefore seems desirable to render
the pigs unconscious prior to this
process.

It was hoped that anaesthetising
the pigs might also prevent strugg-
ling during hoisting, which has
been shown to be detrimental to
the quality of the meat.

Anmsthetising is now compul—
sory in several countries, among
others in Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, the N ether~
lands, Norway, Sweden, and the
United Kingdom. In Denmark
stunning of pigs was made com-
pulsory as of July I, 1954. The
measure was relaxed February I,
195 5, and was reinstituted May I,
1956.

In the intervening period, some
investigations regarding electrical
stunning were carried out by the
Danish Meat Research Institute
(Slagteriernes Forskningsinstitut).
Both stunning technique and the
effects on meat quality were con—
sidered. It is mainly the results of
some of these experiments which
are described in this article.

In Denmark, some experiments
have also been carried out by a
committee on slaughtering methods
(Slagtemetodeudvalget) appointed
by the Danish Academy of Tech—
nical Sciences (Akademiet for de

lowing some of this work is de—

scribed and the committee is re—’

ferred to as the ATV group.J

Methods of stunning

Only electrical stunning, which
is the most commonly employed
method of anaesthetising pigs in
Europe, will be considered in this
article. Two other methods are of
practical interest—namely, shoot—
ing and carbon dioxide stunning.
Shooting is a rather slow method
and hardly practicable when the
rate of killing exceeds 50 pigs per
hr. In addition, shooting very
often gives rise to blood splashes
in the meat.

Carbon dioxide stunning has
only recently been developed into
commercial use, primarily by
Messrs. Geo. A. Hormel and Co.,
Austin, Minn., U.S.A. Its use re—
quires somewhat elaborate instal—
lations, and so far the method has
been feasible primarily for opera—
tions involving the slaughter of
250-600 pigs per hr. Develop-
ment work is, however, going on
in Denmark to adapt the method
for slaughterhouses with a killing
rate between 75 and 250 pigs per
hr. A quite efﬁcient installation

 

1

for this purpose has been devel-
oped by Messrs. N. E. Wernberg,
Hellerup, Denmark, and it has
now been installed in about 10
plants]L

Techniques used in Electrical
Stunning

Since 1922 and up to 1954, elec-
trical stunning was used by two to
four plants in Denmark. Gener-
ally, the opinion in the trade in
Denmark was that electrical stun-
ning had some disadvantages,
especially with regard to the qual-
ity of the meat.

Various stunning tongs and their use

Two-hand tongs. In Denmark,
electrical stunning is most com—
monly carried out with stunning
tongs equipped with two electrodes
as shown in Fig. I. The electrodes
are ring—shaped and about two
inches in diameter. The surface
consists of a series of rather dumb
points which will not penetrate the
skin when the electrodes are
pressed against the head of the

Inside the ring is a rub—

Some tongs contain

a built—in switch which will turn

on the current when the arms of
the tongs move towards one
another. Various devices whereby
the stunner could turn the cur-
rent on at will have been tested but
were found impractical.

One-hand tongs.
tongs as shown in Fig. 2 may also
be used. On this model the elec—
trodes are rectangular instead of
circular, but otherwise of much the
same construction as the two—hand
tongs.

Another type of one—hand tongs
is shown in Fig. 3. They have
somewhat larger electrodes and a
special handle. When the handle
is pulled down, the electrodes
move towards one another and the
current is switched on. This type
is generally considered rather slow
to work with.

Tongs with three electrodes.
Tongs with three electrodes such
as those shown in Fig. 4 have also
been used occasionally. They are
no longer in use in Denmark since
their use requires that the animal
be in a ﬁxed position, generally in
a trap, when stunning is carried
out.

Electrodes. In Denmark, elec-
trodes with dumb points are gener-
ally used, while in other countries
electrodes with very sharp points
are employed. It seems certain
that they ensure better electrical
contact between the electrode and
the animal, but for humane
reasons such equipment is not
used in Denmark.

One—hand .

Previously, the electrodes were
usually dipped in a dilute salt
solution to increase the density of
the current. However, salt solu-
tions are rather corrosive, and
plain water has therefore been
tested; it works satisfactorily, as
enough electrolyte to ensure satis—
factory conductance is already
present on the skin of the animal.

Technique of stunning—tradi-
tional method. Up to 1956, the
stunning of pigs was generally car—
ried out in Denmark in the follow—
ing manner: Io—I8 pigs were ﬁrst
led into the sticking pen, ﬁlling
this almost up. The stunner then
placed the electrodes on the head
of one of the pigs just behind the
ears. The pig then stiffened and
fell to the ﬂoor. The stunner gen—
erally attempted to guide its fall

with the tongs and one of his legs
to prevent bone fractures. When
the pig was lying on the ﬂoor, the
operator generally gift-iainpted to

pose and to test in practice a
method which they named the
short—interval method, by which
the pigs are stuck a few seconds
after termination of the stunning
itself. This method is now in use
in most plants in Denmark. Where
it can be carried out, it constitutes
a considerable improvement with
regard to blood splashes.

Stunning by this method is car—
ried out in the following way: the
pigs are led into the sticking pen
and the shackle is placed on a hind
leg of a pig and the pig is pulled
by the shackle across the floor to
the elevator. When the pig is near
the elevator, stunning is begun;
simultaneously, the shackle is
placed in the elevator. Stunning
is continued while the pig is going
up the elevator. Sticking must
take place not later than 5 sec.
after the tongs are removed from
the pig’s head. Because of this re-
quirement, this method cannot be
put into practice easily in many
foreign plants, where there may be
one or even several ﬂoors between
the stunning and the sticking pens.
Even in Denmark there are several
plants where the distance is so
great that the method has not been
found practicable.

The method has a further dis—
advantage. As can easily be seen,
it is a considerable temptation for
the workers to change their
method of work and carry the
stunning out in such a fashion that

 

the pig is ﬁrst pulled up to the
elevator and hoisted up before
stunning is begun. This is very
easy in operation, but of course
violates the basic principle. Close
supervision is therefore required
to ensure that the short—interval
method is properly carried out.

It is for this reason that the fol—
lowing description of our various
attempts to use other means to
avoid blood splashes is given.
These may be of interest because
the short interval method is not
always easy to employ, and also
because, as will be shown later,
the latter sometimes seems to have
certain other disadvantages; for
example, while blood splashes are
avoided, lung bleedings are found
to the same effect as when the tra—
ditional method is used. In addi—
tion, the stiffness of carcass seems
to increase when the short—inter—
val method is used. This is prob-
ably in some way connected
with the fact that the pig is stuck
while in a maximum contracted
state.

While blood splashes seem to be
almost eliminated, diffuse bleed—
ings also seem to be more frequent
than when the traditional method
is used. This may be due to the
fact that the pigs are in a contrac—
ted state and that fractures may
therefore more easily occur than
when the pigs’ muscles are re-
laxed, as after traditional stun—
ning.

Electrical current and potential

In Denmark, 70-90 v. are used,
usually with a frequency of 50
Hertz, this being that of the usual
power supply.

With a potential of about 75 v.
between the electrodes, a current
of about 02—03 amp. ﬂows be-
tween the electrodes when they
are behind the ears. When one of
the electrodes is moved up over the
eye, the current rises to 05—08
amp.

These ﬁgures apply when the
skin of the pig is dry and when the
electrodes are well insulated from
the other parts of the tongs. If
the pig is wet, the current may rise
to from 0-6-0-8 amp.

The ratio between the flow of cur—
rent over the skin from one elec-
trodetoanotherandtheﬂowthrough
the brain has not been studied.

If the insulation of the elec-
trodes from the rest of the tongs is
reduced, for instance by dipping
the tongs in brine, the total ﬂow of
current also rises markedly, often
up to 0-8 amp. for dry pigs and
1-1 amp. for wet pigs. We have
found that under these circum—
stances, up to 0-5 amp. may flow
over the wet surface of the tongs.

Il. EFFECT OF ELECTRICAL STUN-
NING ON CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE
ANIMAL

Our knowledge of the effect of
electricity on the brain of an
animal and general observation
on the effect of electrical stunning
of pigs enables us to draw the fol—
lowing picture of the physiological
state of the animal when exposed
to electrical stunning.

When the current first stimu—
lates the brain, all the skeletal
muscles go into a maximum con—
traction, Le. a tonic cramp. As a
consequence, the blood stream
through the capillaries of the
muscles is considerably reduced.
The electrical stimulation tempor-
arily depresses the activity of the
heart, and the blood pressure rises
in the veins to more than twice
the normal.1 This leads to in—
creased blood pressure in the
arteries as well.

Once the current is switched off,
the tonic cramps persist for a few
seconds, then the animal’s muscles
relax for a few seconds, after

 




 

which a rhythmic cramp, the so-
called clonus, appears, with walk-
ing—like movements of the limbs.
This usually lasts 30-45 sec. Then
follows a period of general paraly—
sis before the pig slowly returns to
consciousness.

Loss of consciousness. An im—
portant problem is whether elec-~
trical stunning of pigs does render
the animals insensible to pain, or
if they are merely paralysed.

N 0 means exist whereby a ﬁnal
answer to this question can be ob-
tained. One can look at the ex—
periences of humans after electro-
shock treatment. From observa—
tions by Leduc,2 Zirnmern3 and
Hertz,“ it is known that at least a
low density of electrical, current
may lead to paralysis while the
person is still sensible to pain.
Higher densities are known to lead
to loss of memory, but since this
applies also to events taking place
immediately prior to the electro-
shock, no completely conclusive
information may be obtained from
such persons. It is generally con~
sidered, however, that a true nar-
cosis is obtained.

With animals, the problem be—
comes even more complicated.
The ATV group1 felt that when the
animal shows complete absence of
any reﬂexes when the cornea is
touched, a true narcosis exists.

In experimenting with equip-
ment of the type mentioned above,
we made the observation that if
the pig slips out of the grasp of the
electrodes during the ﬁrst seconds

(4)

of stunning it will jump up and
run away shrieking and trying to
hide among the other pigs. Thus
it seems to “have sensed real pain.
Roos and Koopman5 also con—
cluded from physiological studies
that electrical stunning stimulates
the nervoustisystem but does not of
necessity bring the animal in a
condition resembling narcosis.
Placing one of the electrodes on
one of the pig’s eyes as is ordin-
arily done is likely to make the
current more effectively stimulate
the brain, since electrical resist-
ance is relatively low in the eye,
and it seems likely that maximum
stimulation of the brain is then
obtained. When the current has
been applied for some seconds,
unconsciousness seems to be estab—
lished. This has been concluded
by the ATV group,1 through
demonstration of the animals’
failure to show the corneal reﬂex
from a half to several minutes
after stunning when the pigs had
been exposed to the current for 8
sec. Croft6 stressed that sufﬁcient
density of current is indispensable
for establishment of unconscious—
ness. If the stunning operator is
tired and does not press the elec—
trodes hard on to the pig, or if the
pig is very dirty or has heavy
bristles, it is conceivable that the
current may produce pain, cramps
and even paralysis, rather than
unconsc1ousness.

We have tested this problem
further by using two-hand tongs
dipped in tap water and moving

the electrodes up to the eye as
quickly as possible after the be—
ginning of stunning. W727: found

EétsF-iteod splashes in the ﬂesh

Various workers have concerned
themselves with the effect, of elec—
trical stunning on the bleeding of
the carcass. Eddington and El—
iiot7 and Clark and Tweed8 found
less blood in meat from electric—
ally stunned pigs than in meat
from non—stunned animals. Ex—
periments made in this Institute
and the Departments of Animal
Physiology and Endocrinology
and Sexual Physiology at the
Danish Veterinary and Agricul—
tural College did not reveal any
signiﬁcant differences between the
amount of blood obtained from
stunned and non—stunned animals
(Moustgaard at 012.9).

' Occurrence of blood splashes
(extravasates) in pig muscles has,
however, long been known, and
has generally been considered a
result of shooting or electrical
stunning. The extravasates ap-

pear as dark red, sharply limited
points of pea size or less. An ex-
ample of blood splashes of this
kind in longissimus dorsi of a pig
stunned electrically is given in
Fig. 5. The splashes may occur
in almost any muscle. Most fre-
quently they are observed in the
hip and thigh, the eye muscle
(longissimus dorsi), the diaphragm
and some muscles in the shoulder.
Microscopically, it was found that
blood splashes are due to capil-
laries ruptured because of over—
ﬁlling with blood (Slagtemetodeud-
valgetl). It appears that the oc-
currence of such blood splashes
does not mean that bleeding of the
animal is incomplete. Extensive

blood splashes as shown in Fig. 5 ,

seem to be connected with stun—
ning. We have, in spite of our
quite extensive experiments, only
one case on record when such
blood splashes were seen in a non-
stunned pig.

Estimating the extent of
blood splashes

In Danish studies of the fre-
quency of any such splashes in
non—stunned and electrically stun—
ned animals, the following
methods have been used and will
be referred to below:

A. A general inspection of the
split and chilled carcass, taking
more than ﬁve single extravasates
to indicate the occurrence of
bleeding.

B. The ATV group inspected
the hot carcass and found a num—
ber with numerous extravasates
in some section. These were so
extensive as to be considered a
serious impairment of quality.

C. The ATV group also counted
all carcasses showing from one to
ten single extravasates, but such
bleedings were not considered to
have any real signiﬁcance with re—
gard to meat quality.

D. The ATV group inspected
the cutting up of cured hams for
canning. Each ham was cut in
four to ﬁve pieces. All extravas-
ates in all surfaces were observed,
and more than ten per ham were
considered as an impairment of
quality.

The methods mentioned above
will be referred to as methods A,
B, C, and D respectively in the
following.

Preliminary experiments car—
ried out by this Institute con—
ﬁrmed that blood splashes occur
with increased frequency in elec—
trically stunned animals. Table I
summarises experiments where
method A was used for counting
the blood splashes and where 6 to
9% of the stunned carcasses ex-
hibited such splashes, while none
were found in non—stunned
animals.

The ATV group came to the
conclusion also that electrical
stunning as described above does
cause blood extravasates which

 




 

 

may constitute a serious impair-
ment of meat quality. 1

Therefore, an effort was made
by us to test various stunning
methods and conditions to see if a
method could be devised that did
not produce this highly undesir-
able effect.

Testing various sources of
electrical current

Converter versus transformer.
Alternating current is usually used
for stunning. The current to the
electrodes of the stunning tongs is
either supplied from the main AC
supply through a transformer or
from a DC supply by the aid of a
converter which is connected to a
transformer. The current from
the two sources have somewhat
different wave patterns, although
they both have the frequency of
50 periods a second.

In order to investigate the
effects of different current condi-
tions, some experiments were car—
ried out by this Institute:

I. A 220 v. converter (Kemp
and Lauritzen) having separate
winding connected to a two—
branch transformer (I50 / 50 v.)
with a large iron core. The trans—
former had a section of the pri—
mary coil as well as a part of the
secondary coil wound on each
branch of it.

2. A transformer (220/ 58—65
v.) with a small iron core having
three branches and wound so that
both coils were around the centre
branch. The primary coil was in—
side the secondary one. This ar-
rangement means that the trans—
former will have a certain capaci—
tor effect, allowing a sudden varia—
tion in potential to pass by capaci-
tative induction from the power
supply through the coils to the
pig.

The wave pattern of the two
systems were observed on an
oscillograph. The results are in-
dicated in Fig. 6. The trans—
former gave a sinusoid pattern
while the converter aggregate pro—
duced a rather trapezoid pattern.

To test the effect of these pat—
terns I2 experiments, comprising
a total of 2,933 pigs, were carried
out using two—hand tongs (Sie—
mens). The current was applied

the transformer was used, in 5 the
converter aggregate. Table I con—
tains the results from examina—
tions of split carcasses for blood
splashes in the ﬂesh counted ac—
cording to method A mentioned
above. It can be seen that the
converter aggregate resulted in a
considerably reduced frequency of
blood splashes compared with the
transformer, the number of car—
casses showing splashes being
65% and 95% respectively. The
difference is statistically signiﬁcant

was used, and a resistance * Ioo

stmwed blood splashes in the

meat. It seemed that the ﬁlter
had reduced the frequency of
liiood splashes to nearly the same
level as the converter aggregate.

Inductive potentials

Inductive potentials appear
when the current is switched on

and off at the beginning and end
of the stunning. The potential de-
pends on the position of the wave
at the moment of switch and the
quickness of the switch. The in—
duction potentials were measured
with an oscillograph connected be—
tween the secondary coil of the
transformer and ground. A po—
tential of about 350 V. was found
during stunning.

In laboratory experiments in—
ductive potentials as high as 2,000
V. have been recorded when the
current was broken through a
drop of saline on the points of
contact. This was believed to be
similar to what may actually hap—
pen in the contact between the wet
electrodes and the electrolyte—
covered skin of the pig. As is
known, such breaking of a cur—
rent may make inductive poten—
tials more likely, since the heat
created by the current in the sa-

line generates steam bubbles
around the electrode thereby
breaking the current. The elec—

trode will then cool and the steam
bubbles collapse. Then the cur—
rent will resume. In that way
I0—I,000 breaks of current may
occur per second.

It was attempted to eliminate
these potentials through a system
of neon lamps. Some of these
were placed between the connec—
tion to the two electrodes and the
ground. In the event of a poten-

tial higher than 50 v., the lamp
would connect. Another was
placed between the two connec—
tions to the electrodes; it would
connect at about I40 V. Examina-
tions of carcasses seemed, how—
ever, not to show any reduction of
incidences of blood splashes as a
result of this neon lamp attach-
ment. Thus, while it has been
demonstrated that the pigs are ex—
posed to high electric potentials
during normal electrical stunning
arising from induction when the
current is switched off, this does not
seem to be an important factor for
the occurrence of blood splashes.

Diversion of current

Some observations indicate that
electrical stunning may be harm—
ful to carcass quality if carried out
under conditions when the pig is
on a ﬂoor or in a trap not insulated
from the ground.

Grlatzel10 frequently found con—
siderable blood splashes 0n the
carcass when pigs were stunned in
a steel trap, as is customary in
Germany. Glatzel states that in—
sulating the trap from the ground
materially reduced the damage. It
has been suggested that the cur—
rent may not always ﬂow directly
through the pig’s head between
the two electrodes but also from
the electrodes to the ground
through other parts of the animal.
This would be especially pro-
nounced when the ﬂoor of the
sticking pen is wet and on rainy
and humid days when the skin of
the pigs is wet.

In order to reduce such uncon—
trolled currents, special three—
electrode tongs were constructed.
One of the electrodes was placed
between the eyes of the pig and
carried the required potential
while the two others were placed
behind the ears and connected to
the ground.

Practical experiments with these
tongs showed that the pigs were
stunned very rapidly. The ex_
periments were, however, not con—
clusive as far as blood splashes in
the meat or lung hmmorrhages
were concerned. Such tongs are
very difﬁcult to use under prac—
tical conditions, and further ex-
perimentation with them was
therefore discontinued.

 




 

High potential stunning unit

Our tests included a Dutch
stunning unit, the so—called Elther
apparatus. This unit has been
described by TervoertﬂL1 it ex—
poses the pig to a potential of
150 V. Two—hand tongs with dry,
sharp electrodes are used. The
current is switched on by means of
a button. A relay switches the
current off after one second. When
stunned, the pigs collapse in a re-
laxed state and subsequently they
start to move their legs. After ap—
proximately 15 sec. the pigs were
shackled in a completely relaxed
condition and then stuck. The
sticking took place within 40 sec.
after the termination of the elec_
tric current. However, in our ex—
periments, stunning 316 pigs with
this unit gave 21% carcasses with
blood splashes, using method A in
counting. Many exhibited exten—
sive splashes. Therefore, eco—
nomic reasons forced us to discon-
tinue the experiments and we con—
cluded that the installation did not
offer any advantage with regard to
control of blood splashes.

Since the introduction of the
short—interval method referred to
later, much could be said for test—
ing this in combination with the
Elther apparatus. We have net
done so because we feel reluctant
to use a voltage of 150 v. on
openly exposed electrodes in a
slaughterhouse.

Source of current and
blood splashes

No solution to the problem of
blood splashes was found in any
of the experiments described here.
Meanwhile, the ATV group sug—
gested the use of the short—interval
method referred to below. Where
this method can be used, blood
splashes seem no longer to be a
serious problem. For this reason,
experiments regarding these mat—
ters have been discontinued.

Duration of stunning

To counteract blood splashes it
seems of some importance that the
electrodes be kept on the pigs for
at least 12 sec. This result is the
outcome of one experiment where
the transformer was used. 428
pigs were subjected to electrical

Time lapse between stunning
and sticking

As mentioned above, it has been
the usual practice in Danish
slaughterhouses to stick the pigs
when their muscles have relaxed
after the impact of electrical stun—
ning. That meant that sticking
took place about 50 sec. after
stunning. At that time the pigs
are at the end of the clonic phase
or in the beginning of the comatose
phase of the anaesthesia. It has
been suggested, however,12 that
the pigs should be stuck as soon
after stunning as possible and
while still in the tonic condition.
The ATV group investigated this
idea and has shown, as mentioned
above, that the blood splashes may
be eliminated in this way. The
ATV group has given the follow-
ing explanation for this:

In the tonic phase, the muscle
tissue is contracted and the capil-
laries almost empty of blood.
Even though blood pressure is
high in the arteries, the blood can—
not enter the capillaries. When
the pig is stuck before the expira—
tion of this phase, the pressure is
released through the bleeding be—
fore the clonic phase where the
blood, under the elevated pres—
sure, may otherwise re—enter the
capillaries.

The ATV group carried out a
series of experiments on this sub-
ject. Using two—hand tongs and

an ordinary transformer, 385 pigs
were stuck about 50 sec. after
stunning, and 84% of the car--
casses had blood splashes. Using
method C for counting, 3 car—
casses, or 08%, had extensive
splashes which deﬁnitely reduced
their quality. Afterwards, 2,56
pigs were stuck 5-10 sec. after
stunning and 66% of the car-v
casses contained blood splashes in.
the meat, using method C for
counting. Out of them, however,
none could be regarded as seri-
ously impairing the quality of the
meat.

The experiment also comprised
an examination of carcasses from
non—stunned pigs. In a total of
196 pigs, 55% were found to have
weak blood splashes in the meat.
Thus, blood splashes cannot be
eliminated completely.

Similar results were obtained by
the ATV group using method C for
counting blood splashes found in
the cutting up of hams. Out of 7C)
hams from animals stunned by the
traditional method, 51% showed
more than 10 single extravasates.
However, no hams with more than
6 single extravasates were found in
543 hams from animals stunned
according to the short—interval
method nor in 48 5 hams from non—
stunned animals.

Sticking the pigs 15—20 sec, after
the termination of stunning will
not eliminate blood splashes. We
found in one experiment, using
method A and B for counting
blood splashes, that out of 539
pigs stunned in this way 39
(72%) showed blood extravas—
ates; of these, 2 (04%) had seri—
ous quality impairing bleedings.

Splashes in the meat.

These experiments seem to war—
rant the conclusion that blood
splashes which impair quality can
only be avoided when the pigs are
stuck IO sec. or less after stun—
ning.

Diffuse bleedings

Besides blood splashes, diffuse
heemorrhages may also occur in
the meat. They are due to rup—
tures under physical stress and
might be expected to occur more
frequently after electrical stun-
ning because the animal collapses
in cramps under the impact of the
electricity. Therefore, the stun—
ner should cushion the fall of the
pig to avoid any stress on it. Dif—
fuse bleedings may also be ex-
pected to occur when the pig is
hoisted by a hind leg, especially
while in a paralysed condition as
is done in the short interval
method.

The ATV group studied the fre—
quency of diffuse bleedings and
arrived at the ﬁgures given in
Table 2. The results indicate that
such bleedings are quite frequent
in all pigs, but no deﬁnite conclu—
sions can be made with regard to
the relative merits of non—stun-
ning, traditional stunning or short—
interval stunning. In this respect,
the traditional method may be of
some advantage.

Hmmorrhages in the lungs

Electrical stunning consider—

ably increases the number of pigs
having haemorrhages in the lungs.
The lung bleedings, like the blood

splashes, are caused by the high
blood pressure during stunning.
In the various experiments with
traditional stunning, the number
of pigs with lung heemorrhages
have been approximately propor-
tional to the number of pigs with
blood splashes (Fig. 9). We have
often noticed, however, that lung
haemorrhages and blood splashes
do not always occur in the same
animal. Some animals seem most
susceptible to lung haemorrhages,
others to blood splashes in the
meat.

Quite different from this were
the results with the short interval
method, i.e. sticking the pigs 5—10
sec. after stunning. In the experi—
ments carried out by the ATV
group, blood splashes were largely
avoided, but the incidence of pigs
with lung bleedings was about
250/0—that is, about the same
level as when pigs are stuck about
50 sec. after stunning.

This further conﬁrms the eX-
p-lanation given by the ATV group
regarding blood splashes. The in—
crease in blood pressure during
the tonic phase will immediately
become apparent also in the ﬁne
capillaries of the lungs since here
no contracted muscle tissue pre—
vents the blood from gaining ac—
cess to the capillaries.

In one experiment, the Elther
apparatus gave a frequency of
lung haemorrhages of 65% on a
total of 316 pigs. Thus, in this
respect this apparatus does seem
disadvantageous.

Our experience indicates that

 

bleedings in gall bladders and in—
ternal organs will also occur occa-
sionally after electrical stunning,
irrespective of whether the tradi—
tional or the short—interval method
is used.

Thus, lung hamorrhages may
not be prevented by the use of the
short-interval method.

From an economic point of
view heemorrhages in the lungs
are of far less importance than the
blood splashes in the ﬂesh.

Stiffness of carcasses

It has been a matter of some
complaint that many carcasses
from electrically stunned pigs were
unusually stiff. This becomes
noticeable after the carcasses are
scalded, and renders dehairing,
scraping and cleaning difﬁcult.

An attempt to measure this
phenomenon was made by having
one person evaluate the carcasses
during the slaughtering operation.
A converter was used for stunning.
In one group the animals were
stunned for 3-6 sec. and stuck as
soon thereafter as possible. In
another group the stunning took
11—17 sec. and the animals were
rested 5-15 sec. prior to hoisting.

It appears that the stiffness oc—
curs most frequently when the pigs
are stuck during the tonic and
clonic cramps. If the animals lay
on the ﬂoor until the cramps have
ebbed away and then stuck, stiff—
ness of carcasses was not ob-
served. Thus, the short—interval
method appears to be somewhat
disadvantageous in this respect.

In the third and ﬁnal part of this
article, to be published shortly, the
aathor considers the eﬂects of
stunning upon the pH of the meat,
and on bacterial growth and the
meat’s keeping qualities.

In the third and ﬁnal part of this article, the author discusses the effect of various stunning techniques on
the keeping quality of the meat, and on the related factor of the ultimate pH developing in the muscles.

IV. EFFECT ON KEEPING QUALITY
OF MEAT AND BACTERIAL
GROWTH
AFTER electrical stunning was

made compulsory in Denmark,
industry complained that pork
and bacon did not keep as well as
usual. Such a difference in keep-
ing quality is not easy to observe.
Even small effects on keeping
quality resulting in, for instance,
I% of the carcasses being more
susceptible to spoilage or in the
average reduction of keeping
quality of, say, one day, are of
great economic importance.

Direct observations

In one experiment with the tra-
ditional stunning method we ex—
posed two groups of 20 pig car-
casses each to storage at 8—IOOC.
The carcasses were then shipped
24 hr. in a refrigerator car with
ice ﬁlling and inspected after 24
hr. refrigerated storage. Two
trained judges, working indepen—
dently, were used in evaluating
the carcasses. A score of o for
completely spoiled and IQ for
completely fresh was used. The
non-stunned carcasses received an
average score of 6.28 as compared
with 5.43 for the stunned group.
The difference was signiﬁcant at
1320.001. The difference was, in
the main, due to a high frequency
of green surface discoloration in
the electrically stunned group.

The ATV group carried out a
similar experiment with the short—
interval stunning method where
two groups of 20 halves of pigs
each were stored at IO—IZOC. for
6 days. Afterwards, the halves
were arranged according to degree

of spoilage with the following re—
sults:

Number of halves
f____.___.__J;..__

ﬂ
Keeping quality Non-stunned Stunned

Poor 2 3
Average 7 6
Best II II

Thus, in this case, no evidence
of any difference in the keeping
time was found.

We have carried out a series of
experiments where diaphragms,
tenderloins, hearts, tongues, livers,
kidneys, heads, and muscle tissue
from the bellies were stored at 8 0C.
for up to 20 days. Every other
day, a score for keeping quality
was given and determinations of
pH, lactic acid, and volatile nitro-
geneous compounds were carried
out. In addition, a bacterial count
of the surface was made. It was
hoped that in this way we might
get some indications regarding the
differences in spoilage rates some—
times found between stunned and
non—stunned animals.

However, the results showed no
appreciable differences with re—
gard to any of these factors.

In another experiment, two
groups, one of 26 and the other
of 27 carcasses, were stored at
70C. for 3 days and at IOOC. for
I day, whereupon the conditions
of the surfaces were judged, using
the scoring system mentioned
above. Two trained judges, work-
ing independently, were used. For
stunning, a converter and the tra—
ditional technique were used. The
stunned animals received an aver—
age score of 7.78, while the non—
stunned received a score of 8. 35.
This difference was signiﬁcant at
P=0.0I.

In yet another series of experi—
ments, Wiltshire bacon sides were
produced from two groups of car-
casses, one non—stunned and one
stunned according to the tradi—
tional stunning method. The

groups contained 28 and I7 carn
casses respectively. Each group
was salted in a separate tank but
the same tank pickle was used,
When the surface condition of the
bacon was inspected after matur-a
ing for II days, no difference was
found between the two groups.

Bacterial counts

Two groups each containing 5
carcasses were selected. One group
was from non—stunned animals,
the other from traditionally stunw
ned animals. The carcasses were
subjected to storage for 3 days at
8—IOOC. From each carcass Io
samples totalling 100 cm2 of. surm
face tissue were removed with
sterile instruments. The samples
were collected in sterile glasses;
separate glasses were used for
each carcass and for meat and rind.
sides. The samples were then
washed (shaken) with sterile water
and plate counts were made on
nutrient agar at 200C.

It is unlikely that the difference
in bacterial counts on the skin
side was due to different initial
contamination as the two groups
of pigs were selected at random
(alternating) from the killing rail.

In another experiment involving
the traditional stunning method
two groups each comprising Io
carcasses were kept 4 days at 7-

An experiment was carried out
to measure the effect of electrical
stunning, using the traditional
method, when Wiltshire bacon
was produced. The same tank
pickle was used over and over
again, which is the usual practice.
Ten successive cures were per-
formed with stunned and non—
stunned pigs, which were each
time taken at random from the
same killing rail. The tank pickles
from the two groups were kept
separate. In all other respects the
curing and draining methods were
identical for the two groups. Plate
counts were made at 200C. using
nutrient agar with 4% NaCl.
Counts obtained by this method
are very well correlated with the
degree of sliminess of a bacon
side.

stunning was used. Differences
could be detected between average
surface bacterial counts after 4
days’ storage at low temperatures
(—3 to 30C). The differences
were, however, not statistically
signiﬁcant (see under V below).

Daily surface counts on 5 stun—
ned and 5 non—stunned carcasses
stored at 5—8OC. indicated that the
lag period of the bacterial growth
curve was shortened on the stun—
ned pigs. The difference could
not be proven statistically.

V. EFFECT OF STUNNING ON pH

Since pH has a considerable in—
ﬂuence on the growth of most
spoilage bacteria, special attention
was given to the inﬂuence of elec-
trical stunning on pH, especially
the pH of the meat 24 hr. after

slaughter which may be regarded
identical with the so—called ulti—
mate pH. Several workers have
demonstrated the importance of a

low pH with regard to spoilage

(Madsen,13 Ingram, 1“ Gibbons
and Rose,15 Callow and In—
gram). 1“

An experiment made to study
the effect of pH on bacterial
growth in mild cured pork (Wilt-
shire bacon) at IooC. showed that
the keeping quality (i.e. the time
before the number of bacteria
reached a value of 107) was twice
as long at pH 5.6 as at pH 6.0 and
6.3. There was no difference in
keeping quality between sides
having pH 6.0 and 6.3 (see Fig.
10). Since stunning appears to

have some effect on pH, this says-

that it is likely to affect keeping
time also.

Method of pH measurement

For measurement of pH, two
methods have been suggested.
One, which is used by the Danish
Veterinary Inspection Service,
uses a meat sample amounting to
a few grams which is carefully
macerated and mixed with an
equal amount of water. pH is
then measured in the mixture after
30-60 min. The method has a
certain resemblance to Callow’s17
method for pH determination.

The ATV group used this
method and favoured incubating
the macerate up to six hours at
room temperature prior to mea—
surement.

Another method measures pH
directly by inserting glass and
calomel electrodes into a slit cut
longitudinally along the muscle
ﬁbres. This method was intro-
duced by Bate-Smith18 and used
by several research workers (Cal—
low,19 Gibbons and Rose,15 Os—
tertag and Schonberg).20

In order to compare the two
methods of pH measurement we
dissected the m. quadriceps femo—
rz's from three gammons. In each
muscle pH was measured by
direct insertion of the electrodes in
the meat at ten different points
equally distributed over the
muscle. After the measurement
the tissue adjacent to each point
of measurement was cut out and
macerated. The pH of the macer—
ates was measured after one and
ﬁve hours at room temperature.

The results are given in Table
4. The direct measurement of pH
gave a higher muscle variance
than within muscle variance com—
pared with the macerate measure—
ments. That means that the direct
method has a higher degree of
discernment between the pigs than
the macerate method. The stan-
dard deviation of the measure-
ments was almost equal for all
three rows of measurement.

. The direct measurement of pH
in the meat has been used almost
exclusively in our experiments,
since we consider it a more realis-
tic value than that obtained by
macerate measurements. The

point of measurement has mainly
been 1%. quadriceps femom's and
m. adductor—gmcilis. These mus—
cles were chosen because the gam-
mons are quite sensitive to souring
and other forms of quality de-
terioration in the fresh or cured
state. Further, experience has
shown that reproducibility is com—
paratively easily obtained when
these muscles are used. In addition,
measurement is possible in these
muscles without damaging the
carcass, a point of great import—
ance in the practical experiment
at the slaughterhouses and bacon
factories. In all comparative ex—
periments care was taken always
to measure in the same anatomi—
cal point of the muscle.

Table 5 gives our results of pH

 

stunned and non-stunned pigs.
The traditional stunning method
was used. The stunned pigs were
stuck about 40 sec. after termina—
tion of the electric current. On an
average, pH is 0.11 units higher
when the pigs have been stunned.
Furthermore, the scattering of the
values is a little higher. Table
5 gives the standard deviation.
Strictly speaking, it is not correct
to talk about standard deviation
for the pH measurement, because
the frequency distribution in a
population of pigs has a pro‘
nounced positive skewness. An
example is shown in Fig. II. The
skewness appears to be more pro—-
nounced when the pigs have been.
electrically stunned. This may
mean that the number of carcasses
with pH above 6 may rise con—-
siderably and with it the chance
of quality deterioration because of
bacterial activity (Ingram,“ Gib--
bons and Rose,15 and Callow and.
Ingram)” The ATV group,"
working with the macerating
method, made one experiment
which seemed to conﬁrm that eleca
trical stunning using the short.
interval method raises the average
pH of the ﬂesh of the psoas
muscle. However, some doubts
were raised as to the technique
used. In another experiment,

No reasonable theory has been
advanced to explain the effect of
electrical stunning on the pH of
the meat. Most likely, however,
the heavy stress the animals un—
dergo during the cramps has a
bearing on it. Denmead23 sug—
gests that the tetanic spasms after
electrical stunning are responsible
for the considerable rise of pH in
some carcasses. If this be the
explanation, much is to be said
for the short—interval method,
since the time left for glycogen
breakdown in the tissue is short
and the blood circulation so re—
duced that it permits no removal
of lactic acid from the tissue. This
point is in want of further investi—
gation.

Working with albino rats, Bate—
Smithz4 studied the effect of exer—
cise of the animals on the pH of
the meat in full rigor. He found
after heavy exercise a higher pH
compared to the lactic acid con—
tents than was observed after rest
or light exercise. As an explana—
tion it was suggested that an inﬂux
of alkali into the muscles had
taken place to counteract the sus—
tained increase in the level of
lactic acid. The intensity, rather
than the duration of the exercise
was important in bringing about
the phenomenon.

In spite of several attempts we
have not succeeded in giving ex—
perimental proof of this alkali in—

Summary

Electrical stunning is at present
the predominant method used in
Denmark for anaesthetising pigs
prior to slaughter.

Stunning is executed with a
pair of tongs bearing two elec—
trodes. The electrodes are pressed
on the pig’s head just behind the
ears. Soon after application one
electrode is brought into contact
with one eye. Usually the voltage
used is 75—85 v. between the elec—
trodes, the current alternating
with a frequency of 50 Hertz. Up

to 1956 the pigs generally were
anmsthetised on the ﬂoor in the
sticking pen. After stunning the
pigs were shackled, hoisted, and
stuck. The delay between stun—
ning and sticking caused blood
splashes in the carcasses. There—I
fore, after careful studies, another
method, called the short—interval
method, was introduced. Accord—-
ing to this method the pigs are
shackled and pulled across the
ﬂoor to the hoist, then stunning is
begun and continued during hoistﬁ
ing. Sticking now takes place not
later than 5 sec. after the tongs are
removed from the pig’s head.

This method has almost eliminm
ated blood splashes, but diffuse
bleedings due to overstretching
the muscles and tendons have not
been avoided. The connection be
tween the electrical. current and
potential is described.

When electrical current ﬂows
through the brain, the skeletal
muscles are maximum contracted
into a tonic cramp, and the blood
pressure rises. The electrodes are
removed after Io—I2 sec. and the
pig shortly afterwards goes into a
clonic cramp which usually lasts
30—45 sec. A period of general
paralysis then follows before the
pig awakens.

It is suggested that this electro-
shock renders the pig unconscious,
similar to the experiences in man.
As, however, the question of con—
sciousness in pigs is difﬁcult to in—
vestigate, the corneal reﬂex is

often used as a criterion. The
question as to Whether electrical
stunning causes only paralysis of
the pig is discussed. This seems to
happen under certain circum-
stances, when the resistance be—
tween the electrodes and the skin
of the pig is too high, or if a great
deal of the current ﬂows over the
frame of the tongs.

It is advisable to dip the elec—
trodes in pure water and not in a
salt solution, and to place one
electrode over the eye of the
animal as soon as possible after
application of the tongs.

In Denmark pigs were origin—
ally stuck 40—50 sec. after stun—
ning. This method gave rise to
various complaints especially re-
lated to blood splashes in the meat
and impaired storage life.

Blood splashes generally oc—
curred in 5—7% of the carcasses,
when all animals showing any
splashes at all were included.
Quality impairing splashes oc—
curred in 055 to 1.0% of the car—
casses. Capacitative potentials
from the transformer to the elec—
trodes appeared to make the blood
splashes more frequent. Square
and trapezoid wave patterns of the
current appeared to be less harm-
ful to the animals than sinusoid
waves, judged from the occur—
rence of blood splashes, but do
not, by themselves, eliminate this
type of damage.’ The blood
splashes may, however, largely
be eliminated, if the pigs are stuck
right after stunning and before the
clonic cramps set in, i.e. less than
5 sec. after the termination of
stunning. Unfortunately, this
method cannot be practised in all
plants.

Lung haemorrhages generally
occur in 25% of the carcasses.
While sticking shortly after stun-
ning eliminated blood splashes it
had no effect on the frequency of
the lung haemorrhages.

A considerable number of dif—
fuse bleedings were found, but

(I5)

there are no means of avoiding
them. The number seems to be
greater after short—interval stun—
ning than when the traditional
method is used.

Especially, the short—interval
method appears to cause a certain
stiffness of the carcass, which
makes it more difﬁcult to
slaughter, and also impairs de—
hairing.

As mentioned in the preceding
article (III), the so-called tradi—
tional stunning gives rise to com—
plaints of impaired storage life of
the meat. Series of experiments
have suggested that this stunning
method may reduce the keeping
quality—measured by organolep—
tic tests, {9H and bacteria counts
—of fresh and cured pork. The
experimental evidence is, how-
ever, insufﬁcient to form the basis
of a ﬁnal conclusion regarding
this matter.

Stunning according to the tradi—
tional method has a general ten—
dency to raise the pH on the meat
by about 0.1 unit measured the
day after slaughter. Furthermore,
electrical stunning may give a
greater scatter of the pH values
of the muscles, which results in a
higher frequency of carcasses with
pH about 6.0 where bacterial
multiplication is signiﬁcantly ac-
celerated. Consequently the meat
seems to be rendered more suscep—
tible to bacteriological spoilage.
In a preceding article (IV) in this
series it is mentioned that this has
been conﬁrmed by bacterial counts
and organoleptical tests.

The ﬁndings on this point have
not been conclusive. It should
be realised, however, that the
special short—interval method was
suggested and tested in January
and February, 1956, while elec—
trical stunning was made compulw
sory on May 1. Since then, experi-
mentation in this ﬁeld has not
been possible. This gave a com-
paratively short time for testing
this method. It is hoped, therefore,

that further investigations on this
method will be carried out in
countries where stunning is not
yet compulsory.

There is some evidence, not
published here, which indicates
that carbon dioxide stunning is
superior to electrical stunning in
most of the respects mentioned
above.

could not, of course, be executed
by one person. I wish, therefore,
to thank the staff of the Institute
for their help and co—operation.

I especially wish to thank Dr.
H. Riemann for the microbio—
logical work and Dr. ]. Wismer—
Pedersen for special work con—

?henk you very much for this queetion of the new way of electioel

stunning in the wee to me; I got e ooey of the National Provisioner
from e Eutoh Eeokerg and ee it came by eeepoet it took eome time to

enewer you.

1. thie stunning ie not new for me, it ie our ehook method; although
the voltage ie higher than we are used to; eleo the otunning tool
with needles wee ueee by me, out wee given no again.

the enieele are relaxed and in en ineeneible state for about 2e to
3 minutee; the oorreot time to have the hogs bled to ﬂeeth.

e eleeghterrate of 250 to even 600 head per hour dieoovery for the
BEA beoeuee labour ie very exeeneiveend now there can be no more
objectione from the emerioen eeokere. Only one.men 1e need fer
etunning.

I published already long ago, the peteehiel hemorrhage in.the

lunge can be distinguished as one attributable to electrical stunning
; the Meet Knepeoeion Division of the USA Department of Agriculture
hee to give their approvaln

en intereeting-feot found, was the condition of the lungs of huge

etuok immediately upon release from the equeeee, have epotleee lungs

, therefore Engelhorn meet explore the neoeeeity oh this area very
quickly.

6. a peek current of 700 to 900 milliemperee, that givee a charge of
400 to 600 volte, depending on the resistance of the animal and
.when the peak charge to the animal is attained within i see. with
a duration of l eeo.,there will be provoked an eleptirorm insult,
thus in analogy with men, and a PERFECT UNCONSCIOUSNESS.

It is my opinion, the electric stunning of slaughtering animals, SHOULD
BE GIVEN PREFERENCE TO ANY OTHER WAY OF STUNNING.

When I was not long ago in the USA, I payed a visit at Hormel's modern
slaughterhouse,where a large tunnel is constructed, filled with 60% 002
gas,throughwhich this hogs are transported on a "trottoir roulant" and
are coming out at the other end of the tunnel, unconscious.

There was no glass window in the iron tunnel to see the reaction of the
animals when they enter the gas chamber. The hogs are bled after being
shackled by one of the hindlegs.

With the small bacon animals things went allrigt, hot the heavy hogs and
sows, WERE LOOKING AROUND WHILE BLEEDING AND WERE NO MORE UNCONSCIOUS,
SHOWING HEAVY REACTIONS IN THIS LAST STAGE.

I made many experiments with 002 on hogs and found out, that as soon the
animals enter the suffocating C02 atmosphere, they become very tight in
the chest and they do all they can to find some fresh air.

I AM CONVINCED,THESE MOMENTS MUST BE VERY UNPLEASANT FOR THE ANIMAL, TILL
THEY REACH AT LAST NCONSCIOUSNESS.

It would be interes ng to find anyone like "LEDUC" to effect experiments
on himself, with the C02 treatment like it is administered to hogs(like
he did before with the electric stunning), and to describe the observatick.'
he had therefrom, to stop all suppositions and to come to a real conclu», '
810119

I am convinced the judiciously executed electric stunning of animals shod:
be given preference to any other way of stunning, for thegfollowing
reasonsz‘ k-~

The electroshock, within a relatively short time found application over
the whole world in various hospitals for psychiatry.

In applying the electroshock anINSTANTANEOUSUNCONSCIOUSNESS has produced
itself, and there is a loss of memory for the duration of the treatment.
The patients have no complaints after the shock.

Countless times patients who have undergone the treatment and whereby
consciousness has returned ask the doctor they are still to undergo the
treatment.

Thus as a rule one may state that in case oﬁ sufficient and correct admi-
nistering of current,THERE WILL BE PRODUCED AN INSTANTANEOUS UNCONSCIOUS/e
BESS WITH anti AMNESIA FOR THE WHOLE PROCEDURE.

Please give my compliments and my great admiration to the gentlemen of

the Engelhorn Firm, for the beautiful work they have already done for

the slaughtering animals in the USA, And I fully agree with my good frienu

gggﬁohgcfarlane: THE TECHNIQUE HOLDS GREAT PROMISE AND SHOULD BE FULLY
R'D.

I think my work for FAQ in Iran has come to an and; Iran officials have
asked again to Home, for my coming back to Teheran, but the necessary fund
are lacking. '
With my best wishes for 1959 and great succes in your work.

Dear Mrs .Christine Stevens,

The tender for the new slaughterhouse of Teheran made byLitchfield
is out, and under the slaughterhouse machinery and equipment I find:

1: Electric Stunning Outfits for cattle complete with transformer
and control instruments, similar to Elther

Stunning pens for holding one animal at a time, while it is being

electrically stunned and discharging the stunned animal so that

their feet always are pointing in the same direction when they
slide out on the floor

0
0

Electric stunning outfits for sheep and goats

Rubber Belt conveyors for transporting 360 stunned sheep and goats
through the bleeding passage per hour.

The sheep should all be placed with their feet turning south.

In this country with their strict ritual slaughter, I think

we may be very grateful, the electric stunning is accepted for

the principal slaughterhouse of Iran.

I wonder if the stunner used by Engehorn Company in Newark,

New Jersey can be used also for sheep and goats.

With best greetings

yours sincerely

Dear Mr s. . Stevens:

It was nice to meet you yesterday. I hOpe you found
the trip to Newark worthwhile and got back in good shape.

In reply to your question of the relative time of
emergence of reflex reactions and pain response from electro-anaesthesia
I should like to give the following quotes from a report by Drs. A. C. Ivy
and F. S. Barry from the Department of Physiology at Northwestern
University Medical School. The report is dated July, 1931 and was a
study of electro-anaesthesia on dogs.

”. . . . . . . . . . . The pupillary and patellar reflexes were
lost, but returned a short time before a reaction to pain
could be elicited. ”

". . . . . . . . . . . When the dog finally responded to a pain
stimulus, he became immediately sensitive to further
such stimuli i. e. the passage of the dog into the pain
reSponsive state was immediate and not gradual. In other
words, the animal was aroused by the pain stimulus as a
sleeping dog is aroused. The other reflexes would either
return immediately or in quite rapid sequence. If a pain
stimulus was not applied the recovery of the other reflex
activities was definitely delayed. This means that the
anaesthesia induced by the electric current is quite
different from ether anaesthesia. However, after being
aroused by a pain stimulus, the animal would often remain
in an apparently dazed state for a much longer time—~but
urging or slightest pain would show that the animal was
essentially normal. "

I believe this covers the sequence of events rather

There is to be a demonstration of electrical stunning
at Reliable Packing Company, 1440 West 47th Street, Chicago 9, Illinois
on Monday, January 12th in the early afternoon. The plant Operations
are not as well develOped as those at Englehorn, but you will see a small,
portable battery Operated stunner which I believe holds much promise. If
you are planning to attend, it will be wise to get going on hotel reservation
soon for that is the week of the furniture show.

Again, it was a great pleasure to meet you and I hOpe
we'll see you in Chicago on the 12th.

Dear irs. Stevens:

was a pleasure to see you on Tuesday, even though the environment deserves
ier adjective.
Enclosed are copies of two letters that I think will interest you. I'd like
‘very much to know your own impression of the Engelhorn process.

Nothing important happened or was seen after we parted at the Engelhorn
plant but I spent about an hour on the dressing line, studying lung lesions tlat
resulted from the electric stunning and talking with government inspectors. I
also had a-very interesting talk with the plant engineer, Moss, at lunch. Roy
Morse and l drove back to New Brunswick together and we had much additional talk.

I am strongly inclined to believe that the electricity being used at the
ﬁngelhorn plant is almost instantaneously producing true unconsciousness. Although
1 have withheld endorsement, the fact is that I don't know any way to get more
evidence than I got trom what we saw on Tuesday. It Phyllis Croft is correct,
then the only real proof that the hogs are being made insensitive to pain would
be through use of the electro-encephalograph. Do you think that we ought to
engage an expert in that field to make a quick study? If so, can you suggest

the name or any ~xpert that might be engaged?

i think that there is a r~al danger that if we don't approve electric stuns
ning, the Department of Agriculture will say that no humane method is feasible
tor hogs except carbon dioxide. A majority of the advisory committee probably
would back the Department in such a statement. In that case, we would be in the
position or demanding use by all packers of a single patented process and there
would be a real danger that Congress would amend the existing law.

Because of that situation, I think that we should move quickly to determine
whether we are going to endorse the Engelhorn process.

Next Monday I am going to be in Chicago with Roy Morse, to see the operation
of a slightly difrerent technique of electric stunning that is being tried in the
plant of the Reliable Packing Com any, a plant that isn‘t federally inSpected.

IGNORANCE IS NOW INEXCUSABLE

When electric stunning was ﬁrst introduced practically nothing
was known as to its mode of action and it was used quite recklessly
In recent years, however, a great deal of relevant knowledge has
been gained through the treatment by electroplexy of human beings

- suffering from certain mental ailments and this source of informa~
tion has been supplemented by laboratory experiments carried out
with the aid of the electro—encephalograph and other modern
equipment. Details have been published in the JOW/i/lal of lllentnl
Science, Vol. 98, July, 1952.

ESSENTIAL FACTS

The following facts can be stated with conﬁdence:

(1) A shock applied to the head can produce genuine
anaesthesia for about 60 seconds provided that the right conditions
are fulﬁlled.

(2) The test for the genuineness of the anaesthesia is that the
:shock must produce a normal electroplectic ﬁt, the nature of which
”will be described below. If the shock is not strong enough a
condition known as “ missed shock ” is produced, and this may be
anything but humane.

(3) A pig recovers consciousness about 60 seconds after a
satisfactory shock has been given and may then, for about 30

 




seconds, be sensitive to pain but paralysed. This condition is the
“nightmare state ” of Leduc or “ electric curarization,” about
winch there has been so much discussion; the use of theelectro—
encephalograph has made it possible to settle this controversy.

{JGNDITIONS REQUISITE FOR GENUINE ANXESTHESIA

(1) Strength of current (ampéres). The strength of the
k depends on two factors jointly, if ordinary alternating current
< ived from the mains is used. One of these two factors is the
strength of the current, which should not be less than 250 milli—
azunperes. The strength of the current depends, in turn, on the
“air'oltage (which should be not less than 75 volts) and on the
resistance in circuit. Under present conditions in Britain the voltage
sf the mains may ﬂuctuate widely; when a feeder is over—loaded
and a cut is imminent it may drop considerably below its nominal
value. The resistance lies mainly at the contact of the electrodes
with the skin ; it depends on the construction and condition of the
electrodes and skin and on the pressure exerted on them.

(2) Time of application. Provided that the current in
rnilliamperes exceeds a certain minimum, an electroplectic ﬁt can be
induced by keeping the current on for a sufficiently long time. The
time required becomes longer as the current—strength becomes
smaller, and it also varies from pig to pig, but under the conditions
recommended here about 5 seconds is generally speaking a safe
time. It this fails to stun the pig the tongs should be applied again,
but repeated failure probably means that some other factor is at
fault.

(3) Position of electrodes. The current must pass through
the upper part of the brain, including the thalamus. The electrodes
must therefore be positioned in accordance with the instructions
given below. If the electrodes are placed behind the ears no
appreciable amount of current will pass through the brain, and the
pig may be paralyzed but will not be stunned.

(4-) Condition of animals. Individuals (and possibly breeds)
vary in their susceptibility ; this fact must be allowed for.

The electrical resistance is least when the skin under the
electrodes is clean and moist ; when the caloric intake (cereals, etc.)
is restricted before killing ; and when plenty of water is drunk.

(5) Prompt sticking. Since a pig may recover consciousness
about 60 seconds after receiving a satisfactory shock, it must be
stuck immediately after the stunning.

Blood splash is due to delay in sticking ; commercial as well as

, humane considerations therefore require that sticking shall be
.done as promptly as possible.

(6) Frequency and wave—form. It is assumed here that the
current will be the ordinary sinusoidal alternatingr current derived
from the mains, with a frequency of 50 cycles per second (in America
601c./s.) If this'is not so the ﬁgures given here for current—strength
and time of application must be changed.

 




THE ELECTROPLECTIC FIT

Since the electroplectic ﬁt is essential to effective stunning its
nature should be clearly understood. A typical ﬁt consists of the
following stages, though the times are subject to variation and are
given only approximately :

(i) Hind legs stretched out Violently, forelegs stiff, head bent
back. Breathing stopped.

(ii) After about 10 seconds the animal gradually becomes.
less stiff, and the legs make vague walking movements.

(iii) After about 60 seconds from the start the animal becomes.
conscious but is paralysed for 30 seconds or so longer.

So long as the current is actually ﬂowing the symptoms (i)—
hind legs stretched out backwards, head bent back —- will be
masked by the general tensing of the muscles, and if current is
kept on for more than 10 seconds or so phase (ii) may have been
reached before the current is switched off ; in such cases the symp-
toms of the ﬁt will not be seen. If, however, symptoms (i) are
absent when current is applied for only a few seconds, it is safe to
conclude that the animals are not being stunned, although they
may be paralyzed.

PRACTICAL INSTRUCTIONS

(1) Make sure that the skin on the cheeks, under the
electrodes, will be clean and free from mud ; fast the animals for 12
hours before slaughter ; give them unlimited water to drink.

(2) Check the voltage across the electrodes with a
voltmeter; the open—circuit voltage should be at least 75 volts.
If it is not, use a different tapping on the transformer.

(3) With electrodes of the tongs type inspect the metal
pad-holder weekly and get rid of any corrosion ; see that the pad,
which must be at least 2% inches in diameter, sticks out from the
holder as at (A), Figure 1, and does not leave a gap as at (B) ; dip
the electrodes in brine before each pig.

With electrodes of the 3—prong Iwel type, clean the bristle
contacts twice daily and have a spare set available.

Do not use electrodes made of spongy rubber, which has a
high electrical resistance.

(4) Apply the electrodes, one on each side of the face, at the
point where a vertical line through the base of the ear cuts a
horizontal line through the upper tip of the snout ; see Figure 2.

If the electrodes are applied behind the ears the pig may be
paralyzed but it will not be stunned.

(5) Press the electrodes tightly together to ensure good
contact ; hold on for 5 seconds.

(6) If the pig does not throw an electroplectic ﬁt (see above)
give it another 5 seconds. If this keeps on happening report it ;
there is something wrong.

(7) It is recommended that an indicator should be ﬁtted to
give a warning if the current falls short of the requisite 250 mA.
An electrician can improvise such an indicator, using, for instance,
a marginal relay and a buzzer.

INTRODUCTION

The effects Of electricity on the living body have been
extensively studied during recent years, largely because Of
the interest in electrO-convulsant therapy in human mental
disease. Instruments and techniques have been perfected,
and it is now possible to study this subject much more
adequately than it was a few years ago. Electricity is com-
monly used in veterinary medicine forthe electrocution Of
small animals, and in bacon factories and some slaughter-
hOuses for stunning before killing.

The usual procedure for electrical destruction Of cats in
this country is to pass alternating current from the forefeet
to the hind feet for about one minute, with an Open-circuit
voltage Of 500 or 1,000 volts. The cat stands in a small
cabinet with its forefeet on one moist sorbO rubber pad
and its hind feet on another ; these pads are the electrodes
and the animal is prevented from jumping Off them by the
lid Of the cabinet which is in contact with its back. The
electrodes for the dog consist Of a Chain collar and either a
hind leg shackle, or a metal tray on which the animal
stands ; all electrodes are wet, the chains being kept in a
dish Of electrolytic solution .whenever they are not in use,
and the tray containing a layer Of the same solution.

The current in both animals passes through the thorax,
but not through the head and brain; therefore it is not
designed to stun the animal, but tO kill it while it is conscious.
In these circumstances it is essential that the process Of
killing shall be rapid ; if the current passes through the
brain as well as the thorax, so that the animal is stunned,ethe
» method Of killing is less important. The apparatus nOW in
eneral use causes death by asphyxiation or by ventricular

ﬁbrillation, according to the strength of the current (Ferris '

et al., 1936). The value Of the current normally is not
recorded, and as it depends largely on the contact between
'the animal and the electrodes, it is likely to vary very much
with individuals. Small currents cause death by asphyxia-
tion, while larger ones produce ventricular ﬁbrillation.
Asphyxiation is a slow method Of killing and arouses fear in
the animal before death supervenes ; it has been assumed
in the past that once ﬁbrillation starts, death occurs and the
animal feels nothing more, but a recent study Of the literature
and CXperience in human medicine have indicated that
unconsciousness does not necessarily coincide with the onset
of ﬁbrillation (Sugar & Gerard, .1938 ; Simpson & Derby-

shire, 1934).

resistance of the animals, so that a comparison with exist-
ing data could be made. The Observations will be extended
tO a larger number of assorted dogs and catsas soon as facili—
ties are available.

Experimental Material.——Eleven dogs Of both sexes Of
various breeds, ranging in age from eight months to four
years six months, and in bodyweight from 158 to 25 -0 kg.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The circuit was as shown in Fig. 1 and the current was
mains alternating current at a nominal voltage Of 220 tO 240

volts.

The electrodes consisted Of a crocodile clip on the

ﬂank site, and a pair Of 7%;-inch artery forceps with insulated

handles on the ear site.

These contacts could be reversed

and in practice crocodile Clips, padded if necessary, would

probably be most convenient for both sites. Rubber gloves

were worn by both Operator and assistant as a precaution,
during this experimental work, but they are not essential.
The foot-switch was used initially as the Operative switch,
but it developed a fault and during the latter part Of the work
the mains wall-switch was used to close the circuit. In
practice it would be very desirable tO use a foot-switch for

this purpose, so that both hands Would be free.

The dog was led into the operating theatre and the ﬂank
site clipped ; this site was over the last rib on the left side,
about 2 inches lateral to the ventral mid-line. The ear site
was on the anterior border of the right ear, close to the skull.
This site was prepared, if necessary, and the dog was put
on the operating table with the left side uppermost, the
restraint being identical with that normally used for injec-
tion of the left saphena vein. The electrodes were ﬁxed,
' after moistenng the sites if necessary, and the current switched
on ; this whole process of preparation occupied about two
minutes. .

The current was passed for varying periods of time and
the condition of the heart followed by auscultation after the
current was switched off. The general behaviour of the dog
was observed, and a post—mortem examination of the thoracic
organs and of the brain was carried out on each dog.

RESULTS

The results of the electrocution process are summarised

became ﬂaccid. In‘some cases the heart had stopped when
the current was switched off, but in others it had not and
in these latter instances the dog would have regained cnn~
sciousness if the current had not been restarted. it dries
not necessarily follow, however, that two doses of 15 Si‘élmlds
would have the same effect on the heart as one dose (f 30
seconds in any particular animal. .

DISCUSSION

A great deal of information on electric stunning is 2;:gaxail-
able to—day, because this procedure is used in the electrou
convulsant therapy of human mental patients, and alse as a
routine method in bacon factories. The behaviour Sf a
living being which has been electrically stunned has heen
studied, the electrical activity of the brain has been recwded,
and the subjective impressions of human patients have been
described (Longley, 1949, 1950 ; Croft, 1952). This: work
showed that unconsciousness occurred when current gassed
through the head produced a genuine electroplectic ﬁt.
The characters of this ﬁt consisted essentially of ‘-.r:i»;ulent
extension of the hind legs with stiffening of all limhs and

Litter-mates are bracketed together. Where several short doses of current are shown, the heart was still beating when the currentwas
stopped until after the ﬁnal dose. Time was not measured in the second dog as restraint was inadequate and the electrode slipped. the
two ﬁgures given under “ current ” refer to the value at the beginning and end of the electrocution period.

, The following points are of particular interest.
(i) The heart was not stopped by a current of 250 mA.
for 10 seconds.

(ii) The minimum initial value of the current was 110 mA. ,

(iii) Clipping the ear site was unnecessary.

(iv) Tap-water was a suitable wetting agent.

(v) The electrical resistance of the dogs varied widely in
the present series, and this variation was not directly
correlated with any of the other factors studied ; it
was probably due partly to variations in the set-up
(e.g., strength of grip on forceps) and partly to the
make-up of each individual dog.

Post—mortem examination showed in all cases that there
were some small patches of haemorrhage in the lobes of
the right lung and that these lobes were pale purple in colour ;
the left lung was pink and without haemorrhage. All chambers
of the heart were full and there was no macroscopic abnor-

mality. The brain was normal in appearance and in every ,

animal the anterior and posterior limits of the cerebrum
coincided fairly closely with the limits of the base of the car.

When the circuit was closed, violent extension of the hind
legs occurred and the whole body became stiff, with the eyes
closed ; urination almost always occurred and sometimes
faeces were passed. This rigidity continued until the current

retroﬂexion of the head, together with arrest of respiratien.
If the current was passed for a few seconds only, as in fem-r
cedures intended to stun but not to kill, this stage was
followed by weak clonic contractions of the limbs and aftﬁi‘
this respiration restarted. The characters of an electro—
plectic ﬁt were similar in the rat, rabbit, sheep, pig and 1113119
and the presence of unconsciousness was conﬁrmed by
electro-encephalograms and subjective observations. If the
current through the head was too small to cause unconsciO‘US'
ness, a variety of muscular reactions occurred but the violent
extension of the hind legs with rigidity, and retroﬂexion 0f
the head was not seen. The dogs in the present series all
showed a true electroplectic ﬁt, indicating that stunning
was instantaneous and that death occurred while the animal
was unconscious.

The method of electrocution in general use in this country
to-day, in which the current does not pass through the head,
is not intended to stun the animal; it must therefore kill
rapidly if it is to provide a humane method of destruction.
If the current is large enough it probably produces ventri-
cular ﬁbrillation in a few seconds (Ferris et al., 1936), but
according to Sugar 8: Gerard (1938) and Simpson 85 Derby-
shire (1934) an animal may remain conscious for 12 to 20
seconds after the heart ceases to beat. During this period




of time, current is passing through the animal, and human
subjects have described the pain produced in this way as
:3 severe ; in faCt, it is said to be intolerable when the
currentreaches a value of 25 mA. The pain is due to muscular
cramp initially, but there are also side-effects due to the
SilﬁXia produced by the damage to the respiratory muscles.
Human patients with heart-block also state that unconscious-
does not occur as soon as the heart Stops, and that the
period of consciousneSs is one of fear and pain.

it is therefore obvious that a method of electrocution which
does not stun may include a period of at least 12 seconds of
intense pain ; this pain may cause the animal to faint, or
.ciectrical curarisation in which the muscles are paralysed
may occur (Hume, 1935 ; Longley, 1949 ; Croft, 1952). If
either of these conditions is present, it is not possible to test
Ehe state of consciousness by the usual reﬂexes.

A relatively small current passed through the brain pro—
duces instant unconsciousness, and this state persists for
ahout a minute ; it therefore seemed very desirable to develop
a method of electrocution for small animals in which instant
stunning occurred, so that any possibility of .pain during
death was obviated. Dutch veterinary surgeons have used
such a method for a number of years and have checked the
state of consciousness of the animal by electro-encephalo—
grams. A few English workers who were not satisﬁed as
the humanity of the usual method have devised their own
modiﬁcations which have‘worked satisfactorily.

The method described in this investigation, in which the
current was passed from the right ear diagonally across the
animal to the left flank, included both the brain and the heart
in the circuit and hence stunned instantaneously, and subse—
quently killed the dog. Preparation of the animal was quick
and. simple, and did not seem to disturb the dog ; mains volt-
age was used which minimised the risk of accidents to human
beings and meant that the method could be used in an
owner’s home, with a sick animal lying in its basket. It is

not advisable to allow the dog to stand up when theeurrent
is switched on, unless it is conﬁned in a cabinet, Since the
violent extension of the hind legs may throw the dog against
the furniture and dislodge the electrodes. In an owner’s
house provision should also be made for absorption of urIne,
as micturition and occasionally defaecation occur during
electrocution.

SUMMARY

A practical method for the immediate stunning and humane
electrocution of small animals is described. The method uses
mains voltage and the current is passed through the brain

.and heart by means of crocodile clips fastened to the diagonally

opposite ear and ﬂank. . .

The current passing through the dog during electrocution
has been measured, and the effect of a number of variables
studied. .

The state of consciousness of an animal during the process
of electrocution is discussed.

METHODS or SLAUGHTERINC ANIMALS .
INTENDED FOR HUMAN FOOD—OLD AND NEW*
BY ..

H. E. BYWATER,
WEST HAM

It is difﬁcult for the comparatively young person of to—
day to conceive that, in the long history of man, it is only
within relatively recent times that animal welfare has
. received any serious attention. This is not really surpris—
ing when one reﬂects that only within very modern times
has human welfare been the subject of consideration and
legislative practice in the progressive States—despite
Christian teaching and that of many enlightened thinkers
of the last few thousand years. One has only to read
Dickens to appreciate the conditions under which the poor,
both young and old, existed in the early days of the last
century. Slavery in the British Empire was. not. abolished
until I833 at a cost to the taxpayer (in those days of low
values) of {20,000,000 compensation; and not until
an even later date in the U.S.A. How, then, could it be
. expected that animal welfare should receive serious con—
sideration when human welfare was so neglected?

The treatment of animals awaiting slaughter was raised
primarily in connection with the general problem of
slaughtering and took a subsidiary place, in most Cases, to
the needs of “ public health” (such. as public amenities,
the prevention of “ nuisances ” and the establishment of a
system of meat inspection). . .

Moses was probably the ﬁrst to lay down rules with re-
gard to meat inspection,‘bvut although he is often quoted

as the authority on the Jewish method of slaughter, I can .

ﬁnd in the Bible no actual mention of detailed instructions
concerning the slaughter of animals for human food, though
conditions with regard to animals slaughtered in the sacriﬁ-
cial ritual are laid down. Theformer have been added by
the Jewish law givers, from time to time, since the days of
Moses and do not form part of the Bible' or the Jewish
equivalent. Moses, however, was not unmindful of animal
welfare and, until comparatively recent times, the Jews, as
a whole, were probably more “ animal welfare minded ”
than many Christians. St. Paul taught that many of the
Jewish religious. practices were not incumbent on the
Christians and it is on this account that Christians do not
observe the practice of Jewish ritual slaughter. ~

The Mohammedans observe many of the injunctions 0
Moses, but they do not necessarily accept the usages of the
Jews which have been dictated by the Jewish law givers
after Mohamet. Islamic ritual slaughter is, therefore, based
upon that of the Jews but does not follow it in all details
and indeed may differ according to the particular Islamic
sect which .practises it.

In this country the slaughter of animals began to receive

some attention in the early days of the last century in con-
nection with animal welfare in general and many societies
and small bodies were formed with this aim in View.

The R.S.P.C.A. began to take an interest in the slaughter
of animals in I824. In the ﬁrst Minute Book of the

Society, dated June 16th, I824, there is a record of the .

following resolution being passed at a meeting held, appro-
priately enough, at the Old Slaughters’ Coffee House in
St. Martin’s Lane:.——“ That a Committee be appointed to
adopt measures for inspecting of markets and streets of the

* SubWaddress given to the UFAW. Summer School
held at Flatford Mill,pnear Colchester, in September, 1950.

Metropolis, slaughterhouses and the conduct of coachmen,
etc.” Among the names of the ﬁrst Committee members
is that of William Wilberforce of slave trafﬁc fame. It IS
of interest that he started Parliamentary action with regard
to the abolition of the slave trade only three years pre-
viously and it was not until nine years later that the Act
for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire received
the Royal Assent.

Most slaughterhouses in those days, in the London area,
were situated underground, and apparently it was the prac-
tice when unloading sheep from carts to throw them into
the underground cellars without bothering whether or not
they were injured in the process. The methods of slaughter
were often revolting in the extreme—especially the com-
mon practice of cutting the legs of calves at intervals of
time until the animals died of lack of blood. This practice
persisted for many years and there are some living to-day
who can remember this method of producing white veal.
Not infrequently, many hours—even days—might elapse
befOre death ensued.

Benjamin Ward Richardson founded the Model Abattoir
Society (now administered by the Royal Sanitary Institute)
in I886 for reforms in slaughter practice and meat inspec—
tion. He was averse to many orthodox medical views and
propounded certain erroneous theories on the clotting of
blood which, incidentally, gained him the Astley Cooper
Prize. It was the necessity to collect blood for this work
that brought him'into contact with slaughterhouses and
slaughtering. He experimented with various anaesthetics
“including electricity. Richardson‘was on the staff of the
London Temperance Hospital, and in 1871 he read a paper
before the Medical Society of London on “ A Preliminary
Research to Discover Practical Methods of Killing Animals
without the Inﬂiction of Pain.” He extolled the pole-axe,
skilfully used, but denounced the sticking of sheep, calves
and pigs. He postulated the need for simplicity in method,
certain and rapid abolition of consciousness without inter-
ference with the blood ﬂow or deterioration in the quality
of the ﬂesh. He used electricity through the heads of

‘ rabbits and birds and pronounced it—satisfactory for bring-

ing about lack of feeling; but he did not ﬁnd the method
satisfactory in sheep—although he considered it could be
made so. About the same time the Humanitarian League
was Concerned with similar problems. It upheld anti-
Vivisection and vegetarianism. One of its publications. was
entitled “ Behind the Scenes in Slaughterhouses,“ by a
barrister (H. F. Lester), and was published in I892.

It is as well to bear in mind that when Queen Victoria
ascended to the throne there were no sanitary laws and no
laws for the protection of” animals. '

It was not until I893 that the R.S.P.C.A. took active 7
steps to devise better methods of slaughter. Local authori-

ties were tardy in using the statutory powers conferred upon

them in the Town Improvement Clauses 'Act of I847 and
extended in the Public Health Acts of I875 and I894, to
provide public slaughterhouses, and in utilising their powers
of inspection in relation to private slaughterhouses. The
Local Government Board, now the Ministry‘of Health or the
Ministry of Local Government and Planning, inserted
clauses in respect of slaughterhouses in the model by-laws
as far back as I877, but it was not until 1909 that they
suggested the stunning of animals prior to bleeding. In
that year they recommended what was known as clause 9
to require the stunning of certain animals and, in 1915,
they replaced it by 9A and 9B: 9A required all bovines
and swine to be stunned, but the latter stated that every
animal killed in the slaughterhouses should receive the
beneﬁt of stunning with a mechanically operated instru-

ment unless killed for the Jews. In due course quite a
number of councils adopted one of these alternatives,
amongst tnem being the 28 London boroughs and the City
of Manchester. Despite the powers of local authorities, the
Departmental Committee on Meat Inspection in 1922 re—
ported that most of the slaughtering in England was done
in private slaughterhouses, the number of which approxi—
mated to 20,000,J_whilst the number of public abattoirs was
probably less than 100. The Committee asserted that
“ many existing private slaughterhouses in this country are
very insanitary or conducted in an unsatisfactory way, but
the legal powers which are available do not enable the
sanitary authorities to deal adequately with them.”

In 1898, the question of public versus private slaughter—
houses engaged the attention of the Public Health Com—
mittee of the London County Council. A report was pre-
sented by their Medical Ofﬁcer, which stated that “ the
proper inspection of meat in the numerous slaughterhouses.
and butcher‘s shops in London is a practical impossibility
and nothing but the centralisation of the slaughtering and
the provision of inspection stations will afford adequate pro—
tection to the public.” It was. proposed, as a ﬁrst step,
to set up six public abattoirs, three north and three south
of the Thames. Much opposition, however, was raised on
behalf of the meat trade, and the L.C.C., in 1898 and
again in 1906 when reports were before them, resolved to
proceed to the next business. When the question again
came up in 1909, action was again deferred until the
Government had made investigation into the Whole subject.

The number of private slaughterhouses in London had,
' however, undergone a remarkable and salutary reduction,
from 1,500 in 1873 to 475 in 1897 and 159 in 1922, and to
that extent more efﬁcient inspection became possible.

In 1904 the Admiralty appointed a Departmental Com—
mittee to ascertain “ the most humane and practicable
methods of slaughtering animals for “food and to investigate
and report upon the existing slaughterhouse system,” of
which Mr. Lee (late Lord Lee of F areham) was. Chairman.
They recommended that all animals should be stunned
before blood was drawn; that, where possible, public should
replace private slaughterhouses; that there should be
uniformity of method of slaughter under efﬁcient supervi-
sion and inspection; and that all slaughtermen should be
licensed by the local authority. They also made sugges—
tions for the improved construction of slaughterhouses. Sir
Michael Foster and Professor Starling, in a joint memo-
randum to the Admiralty Committee, reported adversely
on the Jewish method of slaughter from the point of view
of the animals. The Committee considered that the pole—
axe as used by an expert was, on the whole, the
most satisfactory implement for slaughter, , at that time.
One of their suggestions was that sheep and pigs should

ﬁrst be stunned with a. small club ﬁtted with a heavy iron

head. There were at the R.S.P.C.A.’s headquarters, some
years ago, such clubs consisting of an iron ball—weighing
5 lb. or 6 lb.—with an ash handle about 3 ft. long.

In 1913 mechanical stunning, for cattle at least, was
employed in 35 public abattoirs. The model by-laws 9A
and 9B, issued.by the Local Government Board in 1915,
either of which it was open to any local authority to adopt,
were reissued by .the Ministry of Health in 1920 but, owing
to opposition from the trade, a large number of local
authorities did not acquire these powers. The attitude pre—
vailing at the time can be illustrated by a court case.

The Reading magistrates in January, 1922, dismissed a
summons under one of these by-laws, deeming it to be
“ unreasonable” on various grounds; but their decision
. was reversed, with costs, on appeal to the High Court, on

June 15th, 1922, the case being remitted to the Justices
with a direction to convict. .

Model by—laws in regard to slaughter had, it is stated,
been adopted by only 40 local authorities up. to 1922. It
was not until March, 1923, that the L.C.C. adopted by—
law 9B and it appears to be the ﬁrst body to have exempted
Mohammedans from the provisions requiring animals to be-
stunned with a mechanically operated instrument—thus
affording them the same privileges as the Jews. The modi-
ﬁcation of the by—law in favour of the Mohammedans, how-~
ever, was not made until two years after the adoption by
the L.C.C. of model by—law 9B.

Some control had, of course, been exercised with regard,
to the care of animals by various Acts from Richard
Martin’s Act of 1822, but the ﬁrst comprehensive legisla-
tive measure to exert control over the inﬂiction
of unnecessary suffering on all classes of animals was the?
Protection of Animals Act of 1911. Although this Act.
speciﬁcally states that it does not apply to the slaughtering,
of animals for human food unless accompanied by the in-
ﬂiction of unnecessary suffering, obviously, if the degree of
suffering exceeds that ordinarily imposed, legal proceedings.
may be taken—and the R.S.P.C.A. have not hesitated to»
take action where necessary. It was not until 1933 that:
the Slaughter of Animals Act, designed solely to protect
animals in 'slaughterhouses and knackers’ yards, was.
passed. Previously, there had been no fewer than six Bills.
presented to the House at intervals. since 1911, all of which
had failed to reach the statute book with the exception of
one, in 1927, applying to Scotland only, which became
effective in 1928. It is of interest to note that, whereas
Parliament was ready to pass legislation the ﬁrst time a
Bill was presented applying to Scotland, it took 22 years.

. for the same provisions to be made applicable to England.

This was due to the fact that the interested parties in Scot-
land were agreeable, and indeed supported the reform,
whilst opposition from butchers in England was strong. The
1933 Act applying to England and Wales was, in effect,
prepared by the R.S.P.C.A. and was presented to Parlia--
ment by Sir Thomas Moore, an Ulsterman, representing Ayr
BUrghs. Incidentally, Sir Thomas (then Lt.-Col. Moore)
was responsible for the Scottish Act of 1928 and he tried
unsuccessfully to get a measure, for England only, passed
in 1929.

The Slaughter of Animals Act is really an extension and
modiﬁcation of the old model by—laws. It provides» for the
licensing of slaughtermen, who are the men who actually
perform the act of slaughter and who need not necessarily
engage in other work; thus a single licensed slaughterman
can carry out the actual slaughter of all animals in a
slaughterhouse of reasonably moderate size, whilst the rest
of the work—such as handling animals preparatory to the
death blow and the subsequent dressing of the carcases—
can be carried out by a number of unlicensed persons. The
Act requires. that all animals, save sheep, unless a special
resolution of the local authority is. passed to this effect, shall
be stunned with a mechanically operated instrument. Pigs
are also exempted unless a supply of electricity is available
or can reasonably be made available. Animals slaughtered
by the Jewish and Mohammedan ritual methods are ex-
empted from mechanical or other stunning. It should be
noted that the Act applies only to animals. “ slaughtered in
a slaughterhouse or knacker’s yard.” The Act also con-
tains provisions with regard to: driving the animals over
ground which is likely to cause the animal to fall, feeding
and watering of animals awaiting slaughter, the prevention
of blood or other refuse within the sight or smell of any
animal, and preventing (as far as practicable, without

and the maul for pigs can be used by an experienced and
careful craftsman to bring about a rapid and perfectly
humane ending and if, by mischance, the blow is not de-
livered correctly, the skilful operator often can speedily
deliver another blow which only on very rare occasions
fails to achieve its object. Such non-mechanical tools have
the advantage of needing little attention for upkeep and of
always being ready for use—there is no delay in removing
the old cartridge case and replacing with a live charge or
bullet—hence tney are the means of repeated, expedltious
use. They have two disadvantages, however; their use in-
volves muscular effort which, in large slaughterhouses on
a busy day, may result in muscular fatigue and impaired
_ efﬁciency of the slaughterer, and the more imp0rtant disad-
vantage that their efﬁcient use requires skill which can only
.be obtained by practice. Although some degree of efﬁ-
ciency may be acquired by practice on the skull of a dead
animal, real efﬁciency Can be achieved only by use on the
live animal with consequent risk of failures—and herein lies
the gravest objection to their employment.

The mechanically operated instruments causing concus-
sion are practiCally all operated by an explosive charge,
and are of two types, one which discharges a bullet whilst
the other type—which is in effect a mechanical pole-axe—
ﬁres a blank cartridge which impels a rod held in the in-
strument, the captive bolt pistol. The latter is the weapon
of choice for general use on cattle. Weapons discharging a
free bullet are liable to cause injury to the personnel in the
slaughtering establishment, mostly through badly directed
shots which pass. out of the skull causing direct injury or
injury as a result of ricocheting bullets. They also inﬂict
injury upon all parts of the brain, limiting involuntary
muscular movements and impairing the action of the
respiratory and cardiac centres, thus tending to prevent the
full ﬂow of blow.

The Greener “ Bell ” gun, discharging a free bullet, was
in use during the latter part. of the last century, principally
for the destruction of horses. They are very simple in con—
struction, of sturdy build, and require very little attention
for maintenance; consequently they have a long useful life
—_indeed many very old ones are still in use to-day by
knacker—men. Major Derriman, Chief Secretary of the
R.S.P.C.A., invented the R.S.P.C.A. Cattle Killer just
prior to the 1914 war. This instrument, which discharges
a very heavy bullet, is supported on the top of a long
handle with remote control trigger mechanism which
enables the user to stand at‘a distance from the animal.

Major Derriman, an ex-Guardsman, may have seen an
almost similar device (which was employed by Wellington’s
force in the Spanish Peninsular War) in the Rotunda mili-

tary museum at Woolwich. He re-enlisted on the outbreak
of the 1914 war and fell at Ypres. Various other
“ killers ”" were invented from time to time, including the
Speary killer which was evolved by a butcher of that name
from components of the old Verey Pistol used in the 1914
war. Records of the R.S.P.C.A. show that as far back as
1912 their staff was regularly engaged in giving demonstra-
tions in the use of these appliances. The demonstrations
ceased in 1915, but were renewed in 1920. '

‘ The Germans were the ﬁrst to introduce a cap-
tive bolt type of weapon, the ﬁrst of which was
probably the Behr pistol. The original German
pistols were unsatisfactory owing to the wrong type
of steel being used for the bolts, with the result that
they frequently bent or broke, and an already existing
prejudice against any new slaughtering device was intensi-
ﬁed. With the advent of the 1914 war, the German patents
lapsed and Mr. Christopher Cash, a member of the

R.S.P.C.A. Council, devoted a great deal of time and
money in experimenting with a captive bolt type of instru-
ment. As a result, he produced what is now known as
the Cash Captive Bolt pistol. The Temple Cox instrument
followed, and later the Douglas-Schermer, all of which are
efficient captive bolt instruments, in daily use in our
slaughtering establishments for all classes of animals save
the horse, for which animal the captive bolt type of pistol
is unsuitable—owing to the fact that when a horse is
stunned it falls forward immediately and injury to the
slaughterman or gun may result. For this reason a loose
bullet instrument is preferable.

The fact that methods of slaughter involving the use of
either the free bullet or captive bolt are liable to cause
blood “splashing ” in pigs prevented the adoption of
mechanical methods in their slaughter—more particularly
in bacon factories—and this objection was largely respon-
sible for the introduction and widespread use of electrical
“ stunning ” for pigs. The invention of the electrolethaler

_ was brought to notice in this country largely as a result of

the promotion of parliamentary bills with the object of
making obligatory the use ‘of “ humane killers ” for all food
animals.

Electrical anaesthesia is by no means new. - Benjamin
Franklin in the 18th century and Benjamin Ward
Richardson in the 19th, both, carried out experiments with
this end in view. D’Arsonval in 1890 used electricity to
produce local narcosis and thiswas followed by the work
on electrical anaesthesia by Hutchinson in 1892, Pampilion
in 1901 and Leduc in 1902. More recently other workers,
such as Ivy, Barry, Hertz and Silver and the Italian
workers (Martini and others), and also Russian workers,
have engaged. in these studies. The work of these investi—
gators was critically examined by Longley in 1944 and
appeared as a UFAW publication. Hume likewise con-
tended, in 1934, that the use of electrical methods in the
slaughter of animals should not be regarded as necessarily
humane. Longley in the Veterinary journal of July and
August, 1950, apparently modiﬁed the views he expressed
in the UP AW publication. In the early 1930s the stun-
ning of pigs by the electrolethaler was observed and re-
ported upon by veterinary surgeons and human physiolo-
gists, all of whom were satisﬁed that it produced instan-
taneous unconsciousness. Professors McSwiney and
Brocklehurst, together with others, carried out tests, at
Woolwich and Bristol, on behalf of the R.S.P.C.A. and
came to the conclusion that a state of unconsciousness was
produced for the period necessary to hoist and stick the
pigs. It was contended at the very outset that the im-
mobility of the animals was not the result of loss of sensa-
tion but of paralysis of the muscles, and the R.S.P.C.A.
speciﬁcally requested Professor McSwiney to report on this
matter. He stated that “ It is clear that after application
of the current for 1'8 seconds the animals are in a state of
unconsciousness which lasts for varying periods.” Sir
Leonard Hill was satiSﬁed that the method was humane
and in the Richardson Ward Memorial Lecture of 1934
said, with regard to the Jewish method of slaughter,
“ Given suitable methods of casting and conﬁning the fore-
limbs, the Jews might avoid any possibility of reproaCh by
using electric narcosis for cattle, as used for calves and
sheep, .so soon as they agree that it does not go against
their ritual. To satisfy the Jewish ritual, it must be proved
that no tissue damage is done by the electric stunning pro—
cess. Exact research on the nerve cells of the brain can
settle the question. To sum up, the electric stunning in-
strument makes the method of slaughter free from all.
objection.” '

structural alterations to existing premises) the slaughter of
any animal within the View of another animal but not the
carcase of an animal. It also requires that the heads of
cattle and horses shall be securely fastened before stunning.
This provision is not a wise one in so far as horses are con-
cerned and is usually not adhered to—since the Act makes
provision for special cases where strict observance of the
Act would be prejudicial to the animal.

It is popularly supposed that animals. are fully aware that
they are destined for slaughter and that the sight of another
animal being stunned increases their natural mental distress.
My experience leads. me to think that the degree of appre-
hension under such conditions is slight. It is frequently
stated that the sight and smell of blood engender fear, but
with this I cannot agree. Animals are strangely indifferent
to such matte-rs and human reactions are no guide to animal
feeling under similar circumstances. - Fear in animals
awaiting slaughter can almost invariably be traced to other
causes, such as parting them from the herd, the shouting
and rough handling and other undesirable incidents which
may, and unfortunately do, occur from time to time. Drag-
ging a bullock’s head down to a ring in the slaughterhouse
wall, especially if actompanied by prodding, pushing and
shouting, is much more likely to engender fear than the
sight of the animal’s surroundings. Horses. can be led into
a slaughterhouse and will wait with apparent indifference
until shot with no constraint at all, except that of a slender
rope halter held by the attendant.

The act of slaughter is accomplished by severing the large
blood vessels in the neck with or without previously render-
ing the animal insensitive to the knife.

The essential feature in the Jewish ritual slaughter is. the
act of “ Schechita,” whiCh is performed by the “ Shochet ”
(or cutter), who makes a rapid incision across the throat
with a very sharp knife; thus severing skin, muscles, blood
vessels, windpipe and gullet. This cut must be complete
and immediate and must not be accompanied by undue
force or pressure, neither may there be any stabbing or
tearing of the tissues. The knife must not be directed in
a slanting manner and, after the incision, if there is damage
to the knife—such as a nick—the carcase is. rejected. The
animal must be adequately controlled and immobilised be—
fore the act of “ Schechita.” This preliminary casting and
positioning of the animal on its back with head forced
forward to expose the underside of the neck is performed
by the ordinary slaughterhouse workers. It is only when
the animal is immobilised in the required position that
the “ Shochet ” will consent to perform the act of cutting
the throat. .

In order to make the casting more humane, mats. (upon
which the beast could be cast) were introduced and later, the
casting pen. These innovations. were not received by many
of the Jews with too obvious a display of enthusiasm and
were the result. of constant criticisms of the ritual method
by Gentiles.

The casting by chain hobbles—often a hoisting tackle—-
accompanied by much discomfortand actual fright, can
be a most revolting sight. A suitable casting pen, efﬁ—'
ciently used, goes a great way towards removing the obvious
objections to the Jewish methods of slaughter. Many of
the pens in use in 1939 were discarded after the Ministry
of Food took over slaughtering. The position deteriorated
until shortly after the late war, when matters became so
disquieting that the facts were brought to the notice of the
authorities. The Ministry of Food then gave directions
that, as from January 1st, 1950, all beasts? destined for
Jewish consumption should bepassed through an approved
casting pen. The Jews are very apprehensive when sugges-

tions are made to alter the technique of their slaughtering
methods and too frequently regard such suggestions as not
merely directed towards the modiﬁcation of this ritual but
as part of a movement against Jewry in general; conse-
quently, their attitude is often by no means co-operative.

Undoubtedly their methods were more humane than those
of other peoples in the past ages, but to—day that cannot be
said to be the case. Some religious practices 'have been ~
abandoned with the passage of time, the introduction of
humane laws by the State and the evolution of modern
thought, but whilst laying aside certain practices. imposed
upon them by the old Jewish laws, the Jews still cling to
their outmoded slaughtering rites. As they can readily dis-
pose of those parts. of the carcase which are considered
“ trepha ” or which require arduous preparation—such as
the hind quarters—to the Gentiles, they slaughter well over
twice. as much weight of meat as they themselves consume.
Moreover, by no means all Jews. adhere strictly to the old
food laws; indeed, it would be logical to assume that the
majority do not. Thus a number of animals, grossly in
excess of those actually consumed by orthodox Jews, are
slaughtered every week by the Jewish method and the
surplus is eaten unknowingly by the Gentile population.
In New York, at least 50 per cent. of all beasts killed for
human food are slaughtered by the Jewish method.

Few animals. are actually slaughtered in this country with
Mohammedan ritual—most such animals are killed in
slaughterhouses in ports by Moslem members of ships’
crews. The essential part of the process appears. to be the
recitation of certain prescribed phrases at the time of the
fatal cut, which is made by any person of the faith—not
a specially trained and appointed “ cutter.” Neither is
any special knife used, it is often one borrowed from one of
the slaughtermen. Hence the end of the beast’s life is likely
to be less desirable than that of one despatched by the'
Jewish method. It must be stated that some Islamic
theologians have declared that there can be no valid objec-
tion to the use of a mechanical stunner which, does not kill
the animal, provided the necessary words are uttered as
the throat is severed. Other Moslem authorities, however,
have not supported this proposed deviation from the estab—
lished custom and have expressed a diametrically opposite
opinion. The matter is, moreover, liable to varying views
on account of different sects within the faith.

Satisfactory slaughtering should not only ensure the mini-
mum of animal suffering, but it should allow as complete
bleeding as. possible and should not be accompanied by a
deleterious effect on the meat, such. as “ splashing ”
(multiple, small areas of haemorrhage in muscles and other
soft tissues), bruises and fractured limbs. Complete loss. of
blood is obviously impracticable, but under reasonably good
conditions about half the total body content of blood should
ﬂow away. Fractures and splashng are more likely to be
encountered after certain forms of stunning and may render
such methods undesirable for all or certain species of
animals.

Methods designed to bring about loss of feeling in the
past have been concerned mainly with producing concus—
sion of the brain and weapons both manually and
mechanically operated have been devised for this purpose.

In this age of the machine, mechanical appliances. are
assumed, {p30 facto, to be superior to the more old-
fashioned methods, but this is not always so and often the
very reverse can be the case if they are not efﬁcient, kept
in good working order, and used with skill and care.

The so-called humane killers are oft-en thought to be in-
trinsically humane and the methods they have replaced
inherently cruel. The pole-axe or felling hammer for cattle

Roos and Koopmans in the Veterinary journal, 1934
and 1936, contended that the method was unsatisfactory
and to their work must, to a large extent, be ascribed the
scepticism which has arisen. If Longley’s opinion, in' his
most recent publication, is to be accepted, then I am satis-
ﬁed that these fears are groundless, but there is an urgent
need for the matter to be investigated and reﬁnements made
in the apparatus should these be found necessary. Electri-
cal “ stunning ”. is also used in this country for calves and
sheep. In South Africa it is widely used for cattle, the
current being applied through the cerebrum by means of
the Footner Mask.

Considerations of humane methods of slaughter are too
frequently, and often exclusively,~ directed to the actual
.” stunning ” or slaughtering process rather than to the total
amount of animal suffering, 27.6., treatment prior to and
during the act of slaughtering. They are often clouded by
ideas concerning animal feeling which are based upon
human reactions during contemplation of impending death.
It is a debatable point if animals realise that they are
being prepared for death. It is also too oftenimplied that
pain and mental anguish are directly related to a period
' of time. This is not necessarily the case. Time may be
much prolonged during periods of mental stress and appre-
hension. Any who have been involved in some episode
which they feared might result in death or severe injury
will probably have very vivid recollections of the slow pas-
sage of time during such periods of mental stress.
The suffering of animals awaiting slaughter and during the
act can be assessed only by those who are trained to assess
. animal reaction and suffering and who have a wide experi-
ence of slaughterhouse practice. Many popularly acclaimed
“ experts ” in such matters have made only occasional
visits to slaughterhouses—too often “by appointment ”to
witness carefully staged demonstrations. The veterinary sur-
geon who has had daily experience of slaughterhouse proce-
dure over a number of years is the only person who is really
competent to form an opinion—in the light of any research
which may have a bearing on any particular method of
slaughter. The opinions of human physiologists and other
scientists are of limited value and should be regarded only
as an aid to the assessment of animal suffering by those
who are familiar with all the various aspects of slaughter-
house practice and requirements and have as wide a know-
ledge as possible of animal behaviour—limited although

our knowledge of this subject is, and must of necessity be. '

Methods which might be quite satisfactory in a large and
well-equipped establishment may be objectionable under
entirely different circumstances in a small ill-equipped abat-
toir and vice versa. The speed necessarily attained in
dealing with animals in a large factory abattoir may render
meth0ds, perfectly satisfactory in a more leisurely operated
establishment, unsuitable and even objectionable and per-
haps, under the altered circumstances, conducive to animal

suffering.

The most important factor in preventing animal suffer-r
.ing is satisfactory slaughterhouse personnel. Experienced

and skilful operators, who take a pride in their work, and
who are not unmindful of the welfare of the animals, will
perform their tasks in a commendable manner with what-
ever approved method may be in use, whilst unkindly or
incompetent workmen will cause avoidable suffering even
with the most perfect equipment. The need for the right
kind of supervision is thus of paramount importance and,
as.supervision is impracticable unless the size of the abat-
toir warrants the appointment of qualiﬁed whole-time super-
visors, the abattoir should be sufﬁciently large to support

such appointments. Small slaughterhouses which are sub—

jected to occasional visits of inspection obviously cannot be

adequately supervised.

The Slaughter of Animals Act requires that only
slaughtermen licensed by the local authority shall be per—
mitted to stun or slaughter animals in slaughterhouses and
knackers’ yards, but no mention is made in the Act of a
test of proﬁciency for these men and it is left to the discre-
ti0n of each and every local authority to license whom
they will. Furthermore, these licensed slaughtermen, who
alone can be controlled by the fear of loss of their licences,
form only a proportion of the staff of any slaughtering
establishment. It is only in publicly owned abattoirs,
where the staff are directly employed by the abattoir
authority, that effective control of employees can be readily
maintained and lack of consideration for the animals pre- ,
vented by a fear of dismissal. ,

At the outbreak of the late war there were about 100
public and some 16,000 private slaughterhouses in operation
in England and Wales in which a large number of sheep
were permitted to be slaughtered without preliminary
stunning. ‘ ‘

Early in 1940 (as a result of meat rationing and the
Ministry of Food assuming a. monopoly of slaughtering) the
number of slaughterhouses in use was reduced to 606 and
still remains at about this ﬁgure. Prior to 1948, the
slaughter of sheep continued, more or less, in the same
manner as before the Ministry of Food assumed Control
and a large number of these animals (in those areas where
the local authority had not included stunning of sheep
within the requirements of the Slaughter of Animals Act,
1933) continued to be killed without previous stunning. In
that year, as a result of questions in Parliament and repre-
sentation by the R.S.P.C.A. and other animal welfare
societies, the Minister of Food directed that, despite the
neglect of certain local authorities to include sheep within
the provisions of the Act, sheep—in common with all other
animals—should be given the beneﬁt of stunning. Thus all
animals legally slaughtered for food in Great Britain should
now be stunned with a mechanical appliance, except those
killed by ritual. methods. 7

The Government have consistently refused to. give any
statement of their intentions with regard to the reopening
of the many thousands of slaughterhouses in use before the
prohibition of private slaughtering. The report of the
Interdepartmental Committee is shortly to be issued, when
some statement of future policy may be made known. It
is to be hoped that the number of slaughterhouses will
remain limited or further reduced to enable more effective
and uniform supervision of slaughtering operations. Mean—
while the Government have announced their intention to
erect two experimental abattoirs which may serve as pat-
terns for a few large abattoirs to meet the needs of the

. whole country.

Is it too much to hope” that. animal welfare may be
prominently in the minds of the planners, or will the needs
of animals be only a secondary consideration to the needs

and the desire for speed of carcase output?

PATHOLOGICAL COMMU NICATION

PATHOLOGY OF BRACKEN POISONING
J. M. NAFIALIN AND G. H. CUSHNIE,

ROWETT RESEARCH INSTITUTE, BUCKSBURN,
ABERDEENSHIRE

In cattle bracken poisoning results in an illness charac-
terised by two essential features: (1) multiple haemorrhages,
especially from the urinary and alimentary tracts; (2) for
several days before death a sharp rise in body temperature,
often to 1070 F. (normal, 1000 F. to 10240 F.). These
features are well known, but we have not found any account
of the underlying pathology. For example, in the paper by
Evans and Evans (1949, p. 176) it is'stated: “ Examination
of the blood has failed to bring to light any signiﬁcant
abnormality, at least in the particular components tested.
Similarly the consensus of opinion is that bacterial infection
does not play the primary réle in the causation of the dis—
ease.” Therefore, it seems worth while summarising our
ﬁndings on the pathology of bracken poisoning, as We have
observed it in heifers fed experimentally on hay and sun-
dried bracken in the ratio of 2 : 3 or on hay, molasses and
bracken in the ratio of I : 1 : 3, and in natural cases of
the disease. ‘

In the peripheral blood of three experimental heifers we
observed severe reductions in the thrombocytes and leuco—
cytes as in the table.

Histological examination of the tissues of the cows which
died revealed that the haemorrhages were of two kinds: (1)
haemorrhages due to infarction with clumps of organisms:
Gram-positive bacilli, Gram—positive cocco-bacilli or Gram-
negative bacilli; (2) haemorrhages from small vessels in the

In a preliminary investigation in which rats were given
bracken as 40 per cent. of their diet, the ﬁndings were: (I)
inanition, which may be attributed to vitamin B1 deﬁciency,
ﬁrst described by Weswig, Freed and Haag (1946), and sub-
sequently conﬁrmed by Evans and Evans (1949) as a feature
of bracken poisoning in rats; (2) severe damage to the bone
marrow affecting the myeloid cells, which give rise to the
granular leucocytes of the peripheral blood, and the mega—
karyocytes, which, give rise to the thrombocytes; and (3)
haemorrhages into the rectum, heart and lungs. These
lesions were not present in a group of 12 rats. fed on the
same diet but given 120 ,ug. of Vitamin B a week in three
intramuscular injections. Thus it seems that in the rat
destruction of the bone marrow in bracken poisoning is
mediated by a vitamin B1 deﬁciency. '

It should be noted, however, that in the rat vitamin B1
deﬁciency alone does not give rise to bone marrow changes
such as we have observed. Therefore, it is. probable that
in, rats some disturbance is caused by bracken in addition
to vitamin B1 deﬁciency.

Whether'vitamin B1 deﬁciency plays any part in the dis—
ease in cattle has yet to be examined; so- far no‘ gross de-
ﬁciency similar to that found in rats has been detected.
However, the evidence emphasises that the blood pathology
of the two animals has much in common, 0222., destruction
of the granular cells and thrombocytes. 4 -

In the human subject gross reduction of the granular
leucocytes leads to an illness, one of whose terminal features
is bacterial invasion of the blood stream.

We think that the information in this note opens up an
approach to better understanding of the pathology of
bracken poisoning. We are continuing to investigate the
problem on these lines. ' '

THE PEL EPTIONS GATHLRED BY PATIENTS UPON PHOM
ELECTROSHOCK OR ELECTRIC NARCOSIS IS BEING APPLIED

OR PAIN ARE BEING EXPTRIENCED;

---——-~——~—--—-_u-———

The shock or electroconvulsiontherapy vas being intro—
duced in the psychiatry by the Hungarian physician
LovellIJDUNA9 who in 1937 published his monograph en—
titled "Die Konvulsionstherapie der Schizophrenie".
Anteriorly MOSAKEL in Vienna already communicated

his experiences regarding the treatment of patients
suffering from schizophrenia, whereby conditions of
hypoglycaemic coma were being suscitated, but we shall
not look further into this kind of therapy for the
time being.

VON MEDUNA started by injecting intramuscularly a
solution of 25% of camphor in oil9 in a dose of 10—40
cubic centimetres. Later on he changed over from this
solution into pentomethylenetetrazol9 known in our
country as cardiazol or corvis9 in America under the
name of metrazol°

This watery solution of 10% could also be applied
intravenously? whereby as a rule the convulsions mani—
fested themselves within 5 to 30 seconds after the in—
jection and in some cases could be avoidedo

However great objections adhered to this therapy°

In the first place often obliteration of the venae on
the spot of the injections ocCUHTed9 in the second place
the patient experienced, before the beginning of the
convulsions9 very disagreeable feelings; the sensation
as if he dreaded to die, while many patients had an
aura with hallucinations of sight and senses, that they
remembered vividly long afterwards.

It was therefore no wonder that with most of the
patients violent frightreactionsciccurred and that
many of them opposed energetically the continuation

of this cure as a cause of which, and especially in
the case of women, the intravenous injections which
from the technical point of view could only be applied
with difficulty9 became so to sayimpossibleo

Many ways have been suggested to avoid these sensations

2,:

 




of apprehension. Also other substances with convulsive
reactions like azoman or triazol have been applied.

If no convulsion occurred the condition of apprehension
accompanied with restlesness and general uneasiness
could remain for hours.

In 1938 CERLETTI and BINI from Italy gave some infor—
mations as regards electrically suscitated insults on

a man of 40 years old, suffering from schiZOphrenia.
This kind of therapy appeared to be much bettero

From theftechnical point of view this method was much
more simple, the complicated intravenous injections in
badly disposed or obliterated venae were a thing of the
past, less complications occurred such as fractures and
luxations, frightreactions were observed much less
because the patient loses the consciousness instanta—
neously while furthermore time and costs of material
were being economized.

Before CERLETTI applied this method on human beings

he tOgether with his assistants BALDUZZI and LAZZERI,
later with BINI had, from 1935 on, been doing , eXperi~
mental work on dogs, whereby epileptiform insults were
being suscitated by means of an alternating current

of 125 Volts.

One day he heard that at the slaughterhouse of Rome,
hogs were being killed by means of an electric current.
He witnessed however that it Was not the electric
current that killed the animals. Through this current
they fell down unconsciously, got the convulsions as

he witnessed it with his dogs and recovered pretty

soon afterwards, particularly if the current was being
administered through the head.

This lead him to the believe that it was an innocent
manipulation, such that he decided to apply it on peOple
suffering from mental disorders.

The electroshock, within a relatively short time found

L . . . .
then appﬂcation over the whole world in various hospi-

tals for psychiatry and partly pushed aside the insu—
line—treatment introduced by SAKEL, because the first—
named method was much more simple, time—saving and
much less dangerous.
Therefore the Cardiazol—shock method has been abandoned
by most of the psychiaters; only a few ones still apply
this method, because they believe that through this,
better results are obtained.

After the introduction of the electroshock—therapy,
endeavours have been made to effect changes in the
administering of the electric current to augment the
therapeutic effect. lhus one tried to use the current
of the lowest tension necessary to obtain the maximum—
effect, to realize the least pathologic changes in

the trains, to avoid complications and to lessen as
much as possible the memory-disorders, which after the
electroshocktreatment sometimes occur, the same as
conditions of confusion.

Thus one arrived at the electric narcosis, a name used
for the first time by LEDUC, who from 1902 till 1907
published extensive investigations.

LEDUC applied an intermittent continuous current,
preferably of 10—20 Volts, which was being interrupted
rythmically 100 times per second in a prOportion of

1 to 9; thus the current went through during one
thousandth of a second. ‘

For this eXperiment he made use of<bgs and rabbits,
upon whose sheared headskin he placed an electrode,
which was connected with the negative pole of the
stunning apparatus. On the loin—region a somewhat
larger electrode was placed, jointed with the positive
pole of the instrument. Underneath these electrodes

a thick layer of hydrophile game, saturated ih a warm
solution of Na CL of 1%, was laid.

When the current was switched on rapidly, there was a

condition of excfment, with.motoric symptoms of agita-
tion, that reminded LBDUC of the phase of excitation

during the inhalation narcosis.

Thereafter followed a period of restfulness, in which
the animal did not make spontaneous movements and did
not react on irritations.

Later on by regularly and slowly increasing the current—
tension, he succeeded in'repressing within a few
minutes the period of excitation and to bring the
animal into a condition of peaceful sleep and complete
anaeSthesiaW during which all sorts of operations

cduld be effected without there being a reaction of

the animal. On account of the great resemblance with
narcosis through choroform, LEDUC called this treat—
ment electronarcosis.

With the cooperation of MALHERBE and ROUXEAU he effected

experiments on himself with a current of 35 Volts and
a

m

 




-4-

a strength of 4 milliamperes, during 2 times 20
minutes, whereby the one electrode was fastened on

the front and the other bigger one on the loinregion,
The observations that he had therefrom, he described
as follows:

The sensation, caused by the excitation of the super—
ficial nerves, was disagreeable, but easy to stand;

it decreased with the time and after a certain strength
diminished, notwithstanding the increase of the
current.

The face was red, there were light contractions of the
muscles of the face, of the neck and of the lower

arms; then he felt an itching at the fingertips and

in the hands, else at the feet and the toes; the
retarding motion first reached the speech—centre,
afterwards the motoric centres were refracted, the
person was not able to react on the most painful
irritations and could have no more contact with his
investigators° The members, without being wholly
flexible, were not altogether stiff. There was a
moaning, however not from pain, but apparently caused
by excitation_of the larynxmuscles. The pulse remained
unchanged, the respiration seemed to be a little re—
strained.

When the current reached the peak, he still heard, as
if in a dream, what was being said; he was conscious
of his impotence to move and to speak with his col;
leagues, he felt the touches and the pricks on the
lower arm, but the feeling was dumbed as is the case
with a member that has been strongly stunned.

The most painful sensation was the following up of the
dissociation and the consecutive disappearing of the
faculties. This impression was like that of a night—
mare, in which one feels face to face to a great danger
and yet cannot yell nor move, However the thinking

was still sufficient to regret, that his collegues

did not have had the current flow through, in order to
complete the hemming action.

After the breaking off of the current he immediately
woke up, there was no after effect at all, save for a
feeling of physical wellbeing and after the eXperiment
he at once held a speech at a meeting.

LEDUC points out, that the sleep and unconsciousness

are marked by a destitution of the cerebral functionse

.-'-1~-r.. Hm

 




-5-

They differ therein, that in case of the coma one is
not able to reconstitute these functions, whereas the
sleep can always be interrupted.

In this regard the electric stopping of the cerebral
functions shows in a great measure the particularities
of the sleep. for when the current is cut off these
functions are again restored. That is why .he further
talks about electric sleep. In 1903 already he suggested
the possibility of using his method for treating the
sufferers from mental disorders. Together with GOUIN,
he has also provoked epileptiform insults on dogs and
rabbits.

In the surgery the Leduc—current has been applied by
TUFFIER and JARDRY, who demonstrated on 7 dogs9 that a
real insensibility was being produced and not merely
a kind of curare—effect. They effected various Opera~
tions on the belly of these dogs9 such as pancreatomy,
gastro—enterostomy and the like. Also these surgeons
applied this nethod twice on human subjects but gave
no details about it.

LECLERC together with GREMEAUX. in 1910 performed
Operations on 2 patients under electronarcosis. The
first one was a woman with an inoperable uterus—
carcinoma, whereby deep incisions were performed.

The narcosis lasted for 10 minutes9 the woman was
quiet, there were only slight retractions of the
facemuscles and now and then a little sniffling.

The pulsefrequency was somewhat lower than before the
narcosis9 the respiration was normal. After the oper-
ation9 she related having felt nothing at all of the
treatment.

The other patient was a.woman of 80 years old with a
big epithelium of the cheek. The electronarcosis
lasted for 50 minutes. the pulsefrequency was 110—
150; the respiration about 24 per minute. After
awakening the patient remained in a light state of

stupor; she recognized her environment and gave good

answers9 but after that turned somnolent again,gradually

comatous with an increase of temperature and died on
the 4th day with a temperature of 40,2 degrees centi-
grade. On autopsy there were discovered strongly
scleriotic arteries of the brains and a mellowness

of the capsula internis on the right. LECLERC however

believes

 




r
—O—

believes that the chloroform narcosis could in tae

same way have made the patient die and that this out—
come did not plead against the application of electro—
narcosis°

In the course of the following years various investi-
gators performed eXperiments on animals with the
Leduc—method or variants of it.

The Dutchmen VAN HARREVELD and KOK about 1930 applied
an alternating current of 30 to 80 milliamperes and
could therewith obtain a state of narcosis resembling
the one that was arrived at by Leduc by means of contin—
uous current. They believed they could speak9 like
Leduc of electrdnarcosis; this state is marked by
symptoms of paralysis9 there are no spontaneous move—
ments9 no reaction on excitations. Certain reflexes
(cornea and lightreflex) are absent and there was only
a slight musclecontraction.

The local symptoms of excitation were the contractions
of the headmuscleso The excitations flowing off along
the nano vagi and the heartaction slowed down°

The experiments were continued in America and in 1944
there appeared from FROSTIG, VOHARREVELD, RESZNICK9
TYLER and WIERSMA, from the California Institute of
Technology and from the Patton State Hospital? a
publication on "Electronarcosis in animals and in men".
This method was being applied on patients who9 for more
than 4 years suffered from Dementia Praecox and more
than a hundred times the electronarcosis has been
performed. The current administered varied between

150 and 250 milliamperes9 thereby a tonic spasm arosei

after 30 seconds the current was decreased until 45

to 90 milliamperes and there were produced clonic

spasms during 5 to 15 seconds.

The patients remained inta state oftinconsciousness

for 5 to 10 minutes by gradually increasing the current,
until stridor originated.

With the greater part of the patients it was possible
tp prolong the electronarcosis until 20 minutes? in
some cases even up to half an hour; in other cases
however after 7 minutes a strong unrestfulness mani—
fested itself (Hyperkinetic—state) so that the electro~
narcosis had to be stopped. As a rule after switching
off the current a Speedy return of the consciousness
could be observed9 the patients after some minutes

reacted on the calling of their name.
This publication soon got followed up by other ones;
we may cite from America TIETZ and collaborators9
GOLDMANN ESTES and CLECKLEY, REZNICK and ARNETTO
From New Zealand: MEDLICOTT; from England: PATERSON,
MILLIGAN REES; from Canada: GEOGHAGAN, who9 in case
there was a hyperkinetic state administered a second
insult, through which the narcosis passed off quietly;
from Italy: LAREAGOTTI, ROSSI, CABITTO etcog from
France: BONDEPIERRE9 HIVERT and HUGELIN and from
Holland: VERHEUL9 who9 for the first time applied
this method in the Sint Willibrordus—Foundation at
HEILOOI
My personal experiences with electroshock stretched
itselfCu from 1939 on, during which period some
thousands of times this method have been performed;
and those with electronarcosis from 1948 on9 during
which stretch of time nearly 150 patients have been
treated about 4000 times.we made use of ELTHER—
apparatuses with alternating current for the electro~
shock and electronarcosis, which instruments have been
manufactured by the Engineering Bureau COHEN STUART LTDO
at Hilversum°

Before we pass over to the description of the subjective
feelings of the patients that have undergone the treat-

ment9 it seems useful to examine first some objective

symptoms° In applying electroshock as a rule we started
with 600 milliamperes during<L2second ; if this dose
appeared to beinsufficient9 the amount of milliamperes
was increased? sometimes until 1000 to 1600 milliamperes
and eventually the duration prolonged until 094 to 0,6
second . Most often the currentintensity or the duration
had to be prolonged in the course of the treatment.

In the case of electronarcosis a preliminary intensity
of 200 to 250 milliampe’es was given during 50 seconds,
which was then decreased down until 50 to 70 milli—
amperes9 after which the current was increased gradually;
with most patients up to go to 120 milliamperes to
maintain the state of unconsciousness. Lager on the

so called ”GLISSANDO" method was applied, (TIETZ9
OLSEN and ROSANOF) whereby the current was not at once
tuned. up at 200 to 250 milliamperes, but gradually
screwed up in 1 to 2 seconds to this intensity° By so
doing the tonic spasms are not directly violent and

thus complications, like compressionfractures between
Thor 5 and 8, which sometimes produced themselves,
were no more observed,

Recording of the pulse is often difficult during the
tonic and clonic spasms. tith a number of patients
the pulsefrequency is increased before the treatment,
through the emotional state of the patient°

In the case of electroshock,in most cases a tachycardia

with extrasystolae was observed, some found a brady—

cardia, others found both,
HADORN described an increased pulsefrequency in the
case of complete insults and bradycardia in case of
absenceso
In case of electronarcosis various investigators
pointed out that in the tonic phase, during the first
30 seconds a stopping of the heart would thus arise,
for 4 to 8 seconds, according to TIETZ even 10 seconds.
I could not observe an interruption of longer than 2 or
3 seconds, neither by palpation, nor by oscultation.
On one occasion through exceptional circumstances,
it was possible to examine correctly the heart—beat°
After an attempt for suicide by means of a knifethrust
in the cardiaregion, a ribsection had been performed
on the patient, a woman, such that the heart could be
felt just underneath the skin.
An interruption longer than 5 seconds could not be
registered° ln.most cases a distinct slowing down of
the pulse was recorded, the minimum value was 20
(before the eﬂectronarcosis 60), with others 50 to
60 per minute, If the pulsefrequency before the narcosis
was high, the drop w,s not as steep, for instance from
132 down to 88, respectively from 268 to 84, from12O
to 96. In some individual cases however I did not find
a fall, but an increase of the pulsefrequency in the
first 50 seconds, as a rule followed by bradycardia.
Generally after this preliminary phase the frequency
starts rising, with some patients this remains rather
constant with light oscillations, others show more or
less violent oscillations. On 2 patients even 172 beats
were counted, while further extra—systolae were often
observed.
After breaking off the treatment we most often see a
direct fall of the number of pulsations, in some cases

”t4; .
During the tonic spasm the respiration comes to a
standstill and the patient becomes cyanotico This
cessation mostly lasts 40 up till 60 seconds, after
which the respiration stareslightly again and gradually
becomes deeper,

We often see that in the course of the treatment the
duration and the intensity of the clonic spasms de—
cline, until they are just about absent, then the
respiration mostly recommences already after 50 to

40 seconds, ,

.After the electroshock as a rule there follows a period
of intensified respiration until 40 times per minute;

in the case of electronarcosis this turned out to be

 

also increased, varying between 22 and 54 per minute.
In case a too strong increase of the current in this
period is effected then stridor arises by contraction
of the vocal chords and the respiration becomes quicker
and more superficial. It is evident that the manner in
which the amctrodes upon the skull are adjusted has an
important influence on the outcOme of electric stunning.
The correct place should be the deepest point of the
cavity of the templeregion, according to TIETZ and
his associa es, one inch and a half above the cheek-
bone and 2 inches and a half before the procomastoideus.
If the efctrodes are placed too far backwards, then
respirationdisorders will already manifest themselves
at a low strength of current and it will thus not be
possible to administer a sufficient amount of current
to keep the patient unconscious, If on the other hand
theeﬂectrodes are adjusted too much on the frontal side,
often the current has to be intensified too much to
obtain a peaceful narcosis,
In case of the electroshock sometimes an increase of
temperature may be observed after the insult; this
symptom has been witnessed by myself with the greater
part of the patients in applying the electronarcosis,
the temperature—increase varying between 0,2 to 1,7
degrees centigrade, after which the temperature dropped
down to normal values, followed by a new rise of the
temperature with some patients after respectively 3
to 4 hours, sometimes after 6 or 7 hours, to get down
to normal at the end.

With

With some other patients the temperature did not rise,

if it did not descend lightly.

The bloodpressure is increased after the electroshock,

according to ACCORNERO about 50 to 60 millimetres Hg.

systolic, while the diastolic pressure scarcely rises.

Vithin 30 minutes the pressure is normal again. This

rise is preceded by a fall of a short duration. This

fall I could also observe with a number of patients

who were treated with electronarcosis. whereupon nearly

in all cases a rise appeared; this rise varied be tween

10 and 95% at the systolic pressure. The systolic

pressure. which was at times recorded9 sometimes

amounted to 240—270 millimetres Hg.

Generally the diastolic pressure rises less than the

systolic one; however in some cases values of 140 to

160 millimetres Hg. were found..sfter the current has

been switched off9 the bloodpressure drOpned instan—

taneously in some cases, in other cases after a few
minutes9 down to the pre-narcotic value9 sometimes
even under this value.

With one patient a distinct hypotension originated9 viz.

after one hour from 92 down to 72, after a few hours

the tension rose again. The same as the puls eacceler-
ation, with various patients we find, before the
application of the electronarcosis, an increased
tension which might probably due to psychological
factors. GOTTS‘HICK has published an elaborate study

of neurologic symptoms appearing with the electroshock.

He distinguishes:

A; a preliminary phas e, from the moment of switching
on the current until the coming into existence of
the tonic contract ion9
a phase of jijHeS from the beginning of the tonic
until the end of the clonic spasms9
an after phase9 from the end of the clonic spa;

until the p: Ltient gets up again.

The preliminary phase is subdivided insgqg the intro—

ductory phase or initial contraction, the flexors of
the extremities contract themselves, the toes are
moved towards the sole, in most cas es there is a ben—
ding backwards of the head and a moving downwards of
the eye—balls.

£3; Intermediate 9's.~ ’n which a weakening of the

muscles

 




-11_

muscles is noticed.

£2; The transitional phase.

The phase of spesms B is to be divided in:

El or tonic phase, with a duration of 5 to 20 seconds.
The eyelids are closed spasmodically, the bulbi dir-
ected upwards and the pupils widened, the flexors
are first tonically con racted, after that the
extensors. In 20% of the cases a positive Babinsky
was found.

In the B2 or clonic phase, with a duration of 10 to
54 seconds there is a sudden slackening of the tonic
muscles, with new contractions, whose duration and
intensity slowly pass away. Sometimes there are
also rolling movements of head and body. Towards the
end the pupils are narrowed, and a cool perspiration
on the cyanotic skin is observed.

In the after—phase he distinguished:

the conatous phase, in which the respiration starjs
to restore itself, the pupils are narrowed, the bulbi
mostly move downwards, sometimes there are side—

movements or nystagmus.

In the beginning the ééghtreflex is absent, cornea~

and conjuctivarefﬂeaes very much weakened but not
altogether suppressed.
The reflexes of the kneetendon and Achillestendon are
increased, sometimes clonic spasms are observed.
Reflexes of the belly and dremaster are absent.
According to GOTTSCHICK this phase resembles stiffness
resulting from destitution of the faculty of the
brain.
In the 02 or delirant phase sometimes there are isolated
musclecontraction in the face, or fingers and toes,which
contractions are gradually generalized. The patient is
unrestful, is turning over in his bed, rises, clutches
at everything and strikes, or bites and moans.
Sometimes there is, with intervals, a similar uneasiness
of movements, symptoms of ”feigned wildness” or feigned
terror. The pupils are enlarged, then sometimes narrowed
again. Light—, cornea~ and conjuctivareflexes can be
suscitated. Tabinsky sometimes positive.
Towards the end of this phase the countenance becomes
more friendly again. This is followed up by the GB or
somnolent phase, in which the patient takes an easy
attitude and slumbers into sleep. The pupils areliyotic,
doTEI?%T?S

m

 

 

 




-12-
sometimes the Babinskyreflex is still positive° The
patient can be aroused by calling or by other noises.
In the C4 or amnestic phase all reflexes are normal.
_ _ answer
Patients to questions, they are however ignorant
of their whereabouts, do not recognize the physician,
neither can tell their age nor where they live.
Most often they know their proper name first, after
that they recognize their environment and their state.
Mostly they remember nothing of the treatment.
In case the electronarcosis had been performed sometimes

at the end of the treatment again clonic spasms mani—

fested themselves. Some patients became hyperkinetic

after 5~7 minutes. They then showed running or cycling

movements and only with difficulty could get fixed on
the bed.

These cases lead to breaking off the treatment in the
beginning. Later on, when it appeared to me that the
patient could easily stand a 2nd insult, like

GEOGHEGAN, I passed over to increase the current in
these cases of hyperkinetic conditions, up to 200 till
225 milliamperes and afterwards decrease again the cur-
rent down to 50 till 75 milliamperes, whereby tonic and
clonic spasms were produced anew and the narcos s
finally passed away quietly.

With one patient only once there were clonic spasms
solely on the right side of the body.

Most often the reflexes of the knee~tendon and Achilles—
tendon were increased during the electronarcosis,

while clonic Spasms at foot and knee could be suscitated
rather often. In a few cases there was a spontaneous
Babinskiposition of the big toe or this could be
suscitated. The tendonreflexes at the arms sometimes
were increased, sometimes they also remained normal.
During the tonic phase the pupils were narrowed and did
not react on light. During the clonic phase there was

a relative widening of the pupils, after that with

most of the patients, were strongly narrowed until the
size of a pinpoint; with other patients we found alter~
natively a narrowing and light widening and with others
again anisocory was established.

then the current was broken off we found that the

pupils after 10 to 15 seconds were normal again and

that they reacted upon light. The eye—balls at the

switching

 

 




  

 

 

-13-
switching on of the current sometimes turned upwards
laterally, with other patients they stared right be—
fore them; with one patient the right eye was turned
upwards medially and the left one was staring right
before him; with an other patient we found both eye—
balls directed towards the middle.

After the paleness and cyanosis at the beginning, in
the passing away of the treatment a reddening of the
face could be observed, the neck and the upper part

of the chest, which reddening extended itself to
shoulders and upperarms. Most often the neck veins were
strongly swollen. There was in the preliminary phase

a pilomotoric reaction of the skin, followed by a strong
perSpiration. This increased secretion of sweat is
individually very different and most often the strongest
during the first treatments. Also there is an increased
secretiOn-of saliva and tears.

then before the treatment a patient did not empty

the bladder, there was produced an incontinency; once
there was defaecation, while further spermatorrhea or
ejaculations could be recorded.

Furthermore I want to depict briefly some reactions of
the bloodpicture and of some substances in the blood.
Most of the investigators found an increase of the
number of leucocytes after electroshock, with,as a
rule,a lymphocitosis. On the red bloodpicture the
judgments are varied, some found no changes, others

on the contrary recorded an increase as well as a
decrease of the erythrocytes.

With the electronarcosis, in 57 of the 46 determinations
I observed an increase of the red globes after 10 min-
utes of this treatment, an increase sometimes amounting
to more than 1 million.

In all cases (75 determinations), I found an increase
of the number of leucocytes varying from 13% to 171%.
Once I could record an increase unto 262%. The stron—
gest increase may be observed during the first minutes
and as a rule it is progressive.

If we examine closely the bloodpicture then it appears
that the cosinophiles show a distinct decrease, which
amounts to more than 50% 1 hour after the treatment.

In the course of the next hours'evolution one may
observe a progressing of this decrease.

As a rule the number of polynuclei is decreased imme—

diately

-14-
diately after the treatment, while 1 hour later a

distinct increase is manifest and these figures are
above the prenarcotic values° The reverse picture

is to be observed to a greater extent with the
lymphocytes°

Directly after the electronarcosis one may see an
increase of the percentage of the lymphocytes, while
after 1 hour a strong decrease is evident. In 53 OUJC
of the 73 determinations this percentage was below

15 and we may then speak of a lymphOpenia.

The proportion of glucose is increased after the
electroshock, there was found an average increase of
20 to 40 mgr.%, In the case of absences there is much
less increase of glucose.

KALINOWSKY and associates found averagely 12%.

SIMON and associates 7%. The maximum-was generally
reached after 20 minutes.

The cardiazolshock appeared to suscitate a stronger
hyperglycaemia, EVALD and HADDENBROCK found an increase
of 55 mgr.o. ’

Generally higher values were found with electronarco—
sis than with electroshock; according to MEDLICOTT 200
mgr.% maximum.

I myself could record on 71 determinations an increase
varying between 20% to 111% compared with the prelimin—
ary value; averagely 57%. This increase appeared to be
progressive the longer the current was going through
and after 20 minutes it reached the maximum.

In ignoring further objective data we now arrive to the
subjective symptoms, that were observed on the tnnted
patients. We already pointed out that in case of cardia-
zolshock the patients often show strong reactions of
fear. These come into being because often there is a
rather long lapse of time between the injection and
the originating of the convulsions, thus the patient
is not unconscious during this period. They remember
this period,in which hallucinations and disagreeable
sensations of menacing destruction and death, nausea
and prOpensity towards vomitting produce themselves,
also after the insult, which eXperiences consequently
often lead to strong resistance against such a treat—
ment .

In applying the electroshock on the other hand an

instantaneous

 

 




-15-

instantaneouslinconsciousness produces itself when
the current is sufficiently strong9 so that these

disagreeable sensations are not experienced. It is

different. when through insufficient current—intensity

or insufficientﬂuration no unconsciousness is produced
(missed shock)° Then the patient complains of violent
dizzyness and nausea and shows vasomotoric symptoms.
There have been investigators, who believed that
through suscitating electroabsences, sometimes called
”petit mal“ reactions, also favourable clinical results
could be obtained and that their advantages lie.
therein that complications could be avoided9 such as
luxations9 fractures and possibly bleedings in the
brains in case of arterio—sclerotic brainarteries.

The said treatment was then most often applied on
physically weak and older patients. It appeared however
that the therapeutic results of this method were little
important and that often also cardiovascular compli-
cations could be noticed. During an electroabsence
most patients show reddishness for a moment and after

a general physical reaction of movements they9 as a
rule, lie down motionless. Others however show un-
coordinated automatic movements9 some patients lie
down and talk or yell senselessly. Afterwards the
patients'are often confused.

In general one could notice that the patients became
more and more afraid and alarmed when they got to

know that this treatment was going to be applied.

In case of the complete electroshock the patient at
once loses his consciousness and there is a loss of
memory for the duration of the treatment. As a rule
there are not much complaints after the shock. some
patients complain of headache, which mostly only
manifests itself after the first treatment. Neither
patients remember anything about the postconvulsive
states of excitement that sometimes occur.

That nevertheless fearreactions occur and that patients
are afraid of this treatment may be due to the fact
that one fears — as is the case with somebody who has
to undergo an inhalationnarcosis prior to an operation-
that he will be rendered unconscious or that he will
not awaken from that state.

In some cases this is correlated with the psychotic

ideas

mamm-rwm - a-

 




-16..

ideas of the patient, particularly in cases of

paranoid psychosis. There are also patients, who,

after a series of treatments become more and more

afraid and start to Oppose treatment.

On examination it appears that this is not due to the
fact that the patient has exnerienced disagreeable
sensations, but to the circumstance that on awakening

he could not make out his whereabouts.

An other reason that patients become afraid may be that
they have seen the treatment on other patients or have
witnessed it from close—by. It is therefore necessary
that the electroshock should be applied in a separate
room and that in case the patients are afraid, prelim-
inary sedatives are administered; preferably on the eve
of the treatment. The threshold values are as a rule
only little increased by these sedatives.

It is plausible too that the fearreactions are the
result of a psychic infection. If on a dormitory there
are one or more patients who are scared for the electro—
shock, by their talking about this subject they will
influence other patients. By experience it has been
established, that on the contrary patients who surrender
themselves faithfully to the treatment, have a favour—
able influence on their companions.

Finally the fear for the electroshock may be correlated
with the fact that patients have undergone electro—
absences in which they had an aura with vestige-9
accompanied by Optic and sometimes also acoustic
manifestations.

From the various investigations on the complete electro—

shock it thus appears that the patient shows a full

amnesia for the treatment, if we may believe others

one may also speak of a retrograde amnesia. Countless
times patients who have undergone the treatment and
whereby consciousness has returned, asked me if they
were still to undergo the treatment.

This was also the case after the electronarcosis;
frequently the question was asked: ”Have 1 been shocked
this morning?" Hereunder may follow some eXperiences
that patients had, when the currentintensity was
apparently insufficient to cause unconsciousness.

In the preliminary period of the application of the
electronarcosis I used as a first dose 150 to 155

milliamperes

 

 




-17-

milliamperes during 30 seconds, then turned back

BO milliamperes in order to increase the current
gradually. In the case of one patient it appeared

that this method failed to ensure unconsciousness,

he indicated that he sometimes heard somebody speaking,
he had disagreeable sensations in the form of vibrations
through the head, a pressure on the eyes and a suffoca—
tingrespiration. Immediately after breaking off the
current he regained consciousness and conversation
could be engaged with him.

Another patient who got administered the same dose,

was rather very unrestful and lay shouting. then later
on these inceptive doses were increased to more than
200 milliamperes these symptoms did not occur anymore.
On application of the “Glissando method“ disagreeable
sensations were also observed occasionally at the be—
ginning. hith this method the current was screwed up
within a few seconds from zero to 225 milliamperes.
then this apparently took place too slowly one patient
indicated that he saw a big fire—ball and that he had

a feeling as if he was falling down into a well.
Another patient treated in this manner once indicated
that he felt waves in his head. "It was like a little
sun, wrinkling out to the eyes.

At an other occasion he described his sensations as
follows: After the fixing of the contact-tape and the
placing of the feltstrip between the teeth the current
is switched on. The sensation is as follows: "In the
centre of the skullbase originates a dynamic centre of
gravity which is propagating itself( across a surface
of ground glass) like rapidly ebbing black circles .
Also a strobosCOpic effect produces itself thereby.

The one and the other is accompanied by quick contract—
ions. Particularly the contraction of the shoulders is
remarkable, besides the spasmodic clenching of the jaws.
Thereafter follows a complete oblivion.

then the current was tuned up more quickly to its
maximum9similar sensations were no more observed, in

any case their was amnesia in their stead. Thus ‘~ a

rule one may state that in case of a sufficient and
yr

correct administering of current, there will be t oduced
an instantaneous unconsciousngus with full amnesia
for the whole procedure.

On one patient there was during the electronarcosis

 




—18—

performed an Operation of a big wart9 vithout there
being noticed any reaction9 while after waking up he
indicated to have felt nothing.

In summing up I believe I may state, that in the case
of the cardiazolshock there are nroduced disagreeable
sensations in the period between the injections and

the coming into existence of the insult9 consisting

of dizzyness and nausea, Optic and sometimes acoustical

hallucinationsoThese sensations also occur on

application of electroabsences or when the strength

of the current is too little for the specific subject

or when this current is tun€d up too slowly to a certain
height. In other cases no abnormal perceptions are

registeredo

SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS ON INTRODUCING
AN ELECTRIC CURRENT THROUGH THE SKULL OE FOOD-ANIMALS
by
Prof. C.ROMIJN, Doctor on physiologics.
(Laboratory for Veterinary physiology, at the
Veterinary University of Utrecht.

Now that the problem of electric stunning of food-
animals has become urgent and the interest in it from
the part of the slaughterhousedirectors is not only
great, but also demands the concern from the society
for the prevention of cruelty to animalu, it might be
useful to probe more deeply into the physiologic foun—
dations of the symptoms which present themselves on
this head.

The purpose of electric stunning of animals, in what
form it may be applied, is the inciting of a state of
insensibility for painperception that has to last for
such a period that the death through bleeding - at
least a similar insensibility through bleeding - is
already manifest at the moment that the insult provoked
by means of electricity, would be terminated.

It is with positiveness that I do not speak here of
unconsciousness, because this state supposes a complete
lack of perception by the senses and because it has
not been proved that the lack of painperception at the
same time excludes the conscious perception of other
stimuli.

On good eXperimental grounds it is believed that the

conscious perception of pain is connected with the

presencabf the substantia corticalis and that with

human beings particularly, it is connexed with the
lobus centralis posterior, the prOper cortical pain-
centre.

If one places an electrode on the Gyrus centralis
posterior and one prickles with farads, then there will
be, dependant upon the strength of prickling, observed
an itching or painsensation, whereby this sensation
will be recorded in a determined part of the body.
These observations have been made on man while in full
consciousness. The conscious painperception from every
part of the body appears to be projected in a determined

area

 




-20-
area of the Gyrus centralis posterior. This vieWpoint
has in no little measure9 been supported by the
experiments of DUSSER DE BARENNE on animals9 whereby
little areas of the respective membranewas being hair—
penciﬂed with strychnine9 through which the correspon—
ding skinregions became “hypersensitive"o
The application of the encephalography with the study
of the physiological architecture of the substantia
corticalis has deepened considerably the sense of these
observations° Under physiological circumstances the
said areas of the sens orium are prickled fro the or—
gans of painperception9 whereby function as such the
free ends of afferent nerves.

The conducting to the respective areas9 of the sen—

sorium naturally takes place via the corresponding

dorsalroots and further9 after the passing through

the substantia gelatinosa Rolando via the string of

Lissauer9 to the higher centres or via the spino—

thalamic tracks to the regions of the sensoriumo

It is remarkable that the conductingspeed in the said

tracksystem is relatively slow9 at least lower than

the reactions on touchingo In making a skinincision

on the lower arm of man9 the knife already after a

quarter of a second is felt as "pression"9 but only

after three quarters of a second as ”pain"o

From clinical eXperiences by man it is knwwn that

either intraspinal pressure on the said ascending

tracksystems or swellings in the thalamy may cause an

unbearable pain9 while mechanic irritations of the

whole rest of the central nervesystem passes away

without painperception. The suspension of painpercept-

ion may of course be effected by anaesthesia of the
peripheric afferent nerve~ends, by blocking of the said

as sending tracksystems or by anaesthesia or destruction

of the areas of the substantia corticalis in the

Gyrus centralis posterioro

While with man9 the localisation of painperception

in the sens orium is rather well known, this applies

in a much less degree on domestic animalso

The best supported investigation on this matter is

undoubtedly that of the English physiologist ADRIAN,

who by means of the encephalography could record the

localising of the perceptions of feelings and pain in
o

the substantia corticalis of rabbits9 cats9 ,

goats and pigs, It was a remarkable fact that for the
touching p€rception a circumscribed region of the
sensorium could be defined, but not for feelings of
pain and heato The cortical touchingareas appeared

to be localized more frontally than with man and
monkeys, where the socalled "prefontal area“ has
attained a higher degree of development.

It goes without saying that here we cannot draw the
conclusion that with the said animals a painperception
would be lacking, but even more reasonably, that this
faculty has been developed on a more primitive level
than with the primates.

Moreover it appears from the observations of ADRIAN,
that the encephalogramm is not useful as detector of
painperception, This consideration makes me ponder,
particularly in connexion with the stunning of food-
animals, as until now there exists no objective method
for recording the painsensations of animals,

While with man the subjective observations may be
verified by the objective recordings, this is in ad—
vance excluded with the animal and one is entirely
dependant upon considerations of analogy with man°
This does not facilitate the problem in question, on
the contrary, our responsibility as human beings
towards the animal consequently weighg considerably
heavier and solely justifies the application of a
stunning method, if it could be accepted with certain—
ty that man, under the same circumstances, would be
deprived of all conscious painperception.

The experiencies of psychiaters and neurologists as
described in the informations from DroBEEK are there-
fore of inestimable value,

The question of cou se immediately arises whether,
nevertheless symptoms on the animals can be observed,
which will justify a judgment on whether or not there

is a conscious perception, In this connexion we must

in the first place think of some reflexes, that during

so many years, have been accepted, in the humane as
well as in the veterinarian clinique, as a useful
criterion for the judgment of the depth of narcosis.

In this respect the corneareflex figures in the prime
ranks, also because this can be provoked by the most
simple means and because the effect, the downwards
movement of the upper eyelid, even if it is only present

in

 




in a little degm , may be noticed distinctly.

Since October 16t h 1846 therefore the eyelidreflex

has been held as a criterion for the existence of a
sufficiently deep cortical anaesthesia, particularly
when inhalation narcotica are administeredo

In order to better determine the value of this reflex
in the judgment of the state of unconsciousness of the

animal, it seems useful to consider minutely the reflex-

tractiono
The receptors for the eyelidreflex dwell in the cornea,
where they are to be found as free nerve ends next to

the bodies of KRAUSE, which are the ones for the per—

ception of exitations of cold.
In fact the free nerve_ends are organs of perception
of pain, which however9 at least in the cornea9 are
stimulated into activity by little touches without
accompanying painperception or painreaction. The state
of agitation passes throug gjh the nerve fibres in the
Nervus opthalamicus, the big afferent branch of the
Nervus trigeminus and reaches the apparently unipolar
ganglioncells Ciﬁldﬁgg Casseriganglion before penetrating
the braintruth/yida the prOper nLurins of the same nerve—
cellso The state of excitement reaches the caudex
on the lateral side9 at the height of the bridg , and
passes through the terminal branches of the Trigeminus,
fibres into the sensitive Trigexninuscore. This core is
far from strictly localised, an important concentration
is found in the bridge as Nucleus sensorius9 but a great
part stretches itself out caudally in the myelencephalon
into the spinal marrow as the descending spinal root
of the Nervus Trigeminus.
It is probable that the fibres which are in connexion
with the cornea principally find their end in the
sensoric bridge core° The transmission of the state‘
of excitement upon the efferent part of the reflex—
traction takes place in the caudex via switching—
cells which connect the said trigeminuscore with the
motoric facialiscore. The efferent facialis fibres which
are responsible for the closing of the eye rise from
the well~developed facialiscore which is situated
ventrally from the middle part of the fourth ventricle,
in the dorsal part of the bridgeo From this core they
run to the ventrolateral side of the bridge and leave
a:

 




".23..

the central nervesystem in the socalled somatomotoric branch
of the Nervus facialis, the N, Ophtalamicus NVII, which make

the musclefibres contract, through which the eye closes.(M.
orbicularis oculi)°

Herewith the reflextraction is complete, from receptor until
effector, whereby a number of transitions of nervous elements
(sysnapses).is located in the braintrunk (caudex), i.e° the
bridge. As a result of these synapses the corneareflex has
been determined at about 500 milliseconds, of which the far
greater part is taken in the passage through the caudex,

Thus the said reflex is in fact a reflex emanating from the
bridge, which can be well prokaed on the bulbospinal animal
where the crosscleaving lies so far to the front side, that
the bridge is situated caudally to the cleft°

An absence of the reflex in the first instance demonstrates
an elimination of the cores and connexions in the bridgepart
of the caudex.

The administering of inhalationnarcotica to man and animal
leads to flooding the entire central nervesystem with the
narcoticum via the bloodvessels,

Experience teaches that the passing off of the reflexes

takes place from higher to lower centres, whereby consequent—
ly first of all the cortical reflexes disappear and at last
the spinal reflexes; the lumbosacral reflexmovements are
therefore only suppressed in a very deep narcosiso Oh good
grounds the failing to appear of the eyelidreflex thus was
considered as a phase of narcosis, in which the cortex was
put out of action.

The application of other narcotics however has thrown a new
light on the physiochemical mechanism of the general narcosis,
above all the use of derivates of barbituric acids, like
nembutal, dial and amytal have considerably reduced the

value of the corneareflex as criterion for the cortical
anaesthesia. The quick development of the histochemy made

it possible to establish the said narcotics not only qualit—
atively in the nervesystem, but also semi—quantitatively.

Hereby the surprising result turned out, that the respective
derivates of the barbituric acid, above all the dial, are
specifically absorbed by certain parts of the central nerve—
system, so that locally there will be a great heaping up,
while at other places the concentrations are practically nil°

It is above all the hypothalamic cores, notably the tuber
cinereum, in which the dial concentrated itself after intra—
venous injection, with as result of it a strong decrease

of exchange of basic substances, accompanied by decrease

of the bodytemperature; The substances in question may
therefore be counted amongst

 




-24_

amongst the drastic antipyretica. Of eminent interest
was however the observation that herewith various

reflexes,which pass off over tho dienceplalon and

the bridgecores have already been repressed by sub—

anaesthetic doses of the barbituricacid narcotica.
Thus it appeared that the corneareflex could already
be entirely suppressed while the patient was more or
less still susceptible to conscious perception.
It goes without saying that this finding is of vital
importance not only for the doctrine of the general
narcosis9 but also particularly for the judgment of
a state of absence or insult during and after the
exposure to electric current of the skull°
The eXperience of the skulleXposure to electric current
is generally that the corneareflex is for some time
absent or very feebly positive, but in my opinion we
are not justified to draw from this fact the conclusion
that the substantia corticalis is put out of action.
The places of the electrodes in electric stunning is most
often such that the greatest density of the electric
field will cross the caudex ; an extensive investi—
gation at the dead animal, would to my idea9 greatly
contribute to an objective judgment of the said consi-
derations.
I believe that the possibility exists that the cells-
in the sensorium may be out of action during a much
shorter period than the caudexganglia due to little
'variations in the magnetic field° Moreover it appears
that there very often exists a spasmodic state of the
eyelidmuscles during and after the exposure to electri—
city9 through which the reaction on an adequate exci—
tation, like the touching upon the cornea9 may be all—
together absento

Thus due to this a second argument has been put
forward why the objective observation at the animal,
does not bring forth the proof for a cortical anaesthesia,
but one more reason to give full attention to the
eXperiences from the humane neurology.
In the light of the afore mentioned considerations the
instantaneous bleeding out after the skull—exposure to
electricity will appear to be an absolute necessity.
The acute interruption of the carotiscirculation will
confront the higher part of the central nervesystem
'ith a quick hypoxia,as it may be well accepted that a

fall

Irma-gm

 




-253-

/

fall of bloodprossure in the truncus brachiocephalicus
will result in a strongly diminished blood supply Via
the vertebral arteries. The quickly increasing hypoxia
will of course deepen an absence in the sensorium, if
any, or it will prevent after a short while the animal
from regaining consciousness°

It is certainly a stringent argument to oblige an
effective cut of the throat, regardless of the change
in value of the slaughered animal; the judgment on this
subject however is altogether out of my competency.
While thus in this question the corneareflex is of

no value for the judgment of an anaesthesia of the
sensorium one could wonder if perhaps there are other
reflexes which will, with greater justice, justifie

a verdicto

Evidently one has to direct his view to those reflexes
that pass over centres, higher than over the bridge
and then it appears that in the first instance the
pupilreflex deserves our attentiono

The diameter of the pupil is determined by the state
of contraction of the narrowing and widening muscles,
in thescase the M.constrictor pupillae and the Modilator
pupillae.

The first one obtains its autonomic innervation from
the ganglion ciliare as postganglionar fibres,that

are to be considered as an extension of the preganglio—
nar ones, which pass together with the Oculomotorius—
fibres from the Diencephalon (the Neucleus of Edinger—
Vestphal ) to the eye.Excitation of the respective
fibres resultsin narrowing the pupil, a reaction that
may be prevented by previous trickling in of atrOpin.
Thus the innervasion from out off the Diencephalon is
a cholinergic respectively a parasympatic innervation.
The smooth musclefibres which are widening the pupil
receive their autonomic fibres from the ganglion cer-
vicale superior, from which origin they run along with
the plexus caroticus and finally reach the musc.
dilatator pupillae. These fibres too are postgang—
lionar, the preganglionar ones find their origin in
the nucleus intermediolateralis of the thoracal spinal
marrow, leaVe the spina via the rami communicantes
albi of Th1 en Th2 and run forth uninterruptedly into

the necksympathicus until in the ganglion cervicale

superior, Excitation of the necksympathicus widens

is:

the pupils9 the same as the eyeslit etc.

The adequate prickling for the regulation of the width
of the pupils is evidently the quantity of light that
falls into the eye (pupil reflex). The lightperception
cells in the retina function as receptors9 while the
afferent nervefibres pass away in the N.Opticus. Via
the tractus Opticus they pierce the medial edges of
the Corpora geniculata and reach the socalled prae—
tectal zone via the brachium of the Golliculus
anterior? which zone is the transitional area between
Mesencephalon and the Thalami. Here they form the

first synapse9 only few fibres terminate in the tectum
Opticum itself (membrane of the Corp.quadrigemina anto)
Now with the domestic—animals the greater part of the
neurons of the second order run via the commissura
posterior to the heterolateral side and bend themselves
ventrallyaﬂong the gray substance around the aquaductus
Sylvii to the core of the N.oculomotoris. A part of

the secundary neurons does not take part in the crossing—
over, but provides the Nucl.Edinger—Westphal on the
lateral side. Herewith the reflextraction is complete
and it is clear that the reflex is only positive with
the normal and the animal deprived from the faculties
of the great brains, as the Thalami (corpora geniculata)
has to be connected intactly with the more caudally
situated parts of the caudex. .An absence of the
reflex during the narcosis points out to an anaesthe~
sia of the Diencephalon and eventually of the most
frontal parts of the Mesencephalon. If one severs the
oculomotorisfibres which are going to the pupil9 then
there is provoked a strong mydriasis that reveals the
existence of a tonically symphatic influence on the
pupil9 as a rule tempered by the pupilreflex via the
oculomotoricfibres,

A narcosis by means of aether on the cat makes the
pupils widen strongly9 not only by the direct prick—
ling of the symphaticus but also through blocking of t
the tonically narrowing influence via the Nooculomo-
toris° Then even with strongly intensive light a
miosis can be provoked no more.

With the eat one notices distinctly on its recuperation
from the inhalation narcosis the corneareflex return
the pupilreflex9 an indication that the disappearance

of the anaesthetic condition in the central nerve-
Eiﬁlem

 




-27-

system passes away from the lower to the higher parts.
Also in this regard it would be important if the last—
named reflex during and after the skulleXposure to
electricity would give an indication for the state

of anaesthesia of the higher parts of the caudez.

The observations however that one may make ' at the
pupil, during and directly after the electric exposure,
are of such a ature, that herein lies no connecting
point for a judgment about the state of the higher

centres° On almost all animals upon which eXperiments

have been made there comes into being an outspoken

mydriasis, more as a result of direct sympathicus—
prickling than due to falling away eventually, of the
Diencephalic functions. The strong widening of the
pupil ignores every lightintensity that is falling in
and may be entirely compared with the state that arises
on prickling of the necksympathicus. It is certainly
not only the sympathetic cores that eXperience the
prickling of the current, it appears from the recorded
bradycardy and the apnoe vagi that the vagusccre is
stimulated in a great measure, Rith regard to the pupil
this manifests itself with some animals through its
only slow dilating during the skull—eXposure to the
current, whereby the irritated Nucleus of Edinger-
Westphal evidently appears as a serious competitor of
the sympathic areas, at the beginning,

Experience has taught that the mydriasis through skull-
eXposure only lasts for a short time, much shorter
than after an inhalation narcosis.

This on itself is not necessarily alarming, if it were
not that the state of the effector (pupil) during and
direct after the skull~exposure makes impossible any
judgment on the state of anaesthesia of the accessory
centra.

While thus none of the said reflexes gives any support
concerning the judgment of an eventual state of anaes-
thesia of the substantia corticalis, one could wonder
if perhaps there may be observed other symptoms at the
animal, during or after the skull-eXposure to electric
current, which will make possible such a judgment.

A striking symptom during the skull—exposure of food—
animals is the acute coming into life of musclecramps,
which on cutting off of the current, manifest themsel—

\

V68

-28..

ves in a violent, tonic bendingcontraction of the
extremitieso The duration of these spasms is different
all according to the kind of animal and the nature of
the exposure to electricity.

Not only the muscles of the extremities, but also
those of neck and body are involved in this state of
spasms.

As the spasms on skullwexposure to electric current of
animals,destituted from the faculty of the great brains,
have also been observed, their origin has not directly
something to do with the presence of the cortex, for
example by prickling of the psychomotoric centres; more
reasonably one has to think of violent irritation of
the various motoric cores, which are to be found in
the caudex and in the cerebellum° The’nervous
mechanism of the regulation of the muscletensions is
so much complicated, that a deliberation on this head
would fall far from the frame of this discussion.

Be it sufficient to point out that from the vestibular
and Deiter cores in the medulla oblongata there are
impulses running constantly to the motoric ganglion—
cells into the substantia grisea of the spinal marrow,
through which the skeletal muscles would be constantly
in a state of tonic spasms, if it were not that from
the Nucleus ruber, a continuous hemming is effected

on this “spasmpreparation".

The souple tensionchanges with the normal animal come
into being through an antagonistic activity of cores
and parts of the substantia corticalis in the super—
located parts of the central nervesystem.

The symptoms on exposure to electricity do not point

out to a putting out of action (narcosis) of the

humming cores, as in that case a "stiﬁneasresulting from
destitution of the brainfunctions" would come into
life, which differs in a great measure from the
actually observed events, On the contrary, the state

of spasms point out to an overexcitation of all motoric
ganglioncells, whereby the reactions are violent to
such an extent, that the animal does neither react on
any excitation from outside, nor on painexcitations

by any painreaction.

Thus from this circumstance it may certainly not be
concluded, that there would be no painperception even

if therevware no facts which would prove the contrary..
In

In summing up our conclusion should be voiced thus,
that in case of the skull—exposure to electric current
of food-animals, no reaction would be provoked or be
absent at all, which will justify' a conclusion on

anaesthesia of the substantia corticalis.

On pure animal physiologic grounds it cannot be said

therefore that the animals are in fact stunned, an
eventual application would only be justified on account
of subjective eXperiences as they are known with man.
However I will not refrain from saying a little word
on this matter.
People, who have been made subject to skullexposure
to electricity and who have no disagreeable reminiscen-
ses from it, or most often have no memories at all,
could have very well experienced a painperception
during the eXposure itself, which afterthis treatment
need not leave a memory to it; in short, the lack of
memory need not enclude a previous eXperience. This
however is a personal opinion of the undersigned and
as I am no psychiater I cannot prove the one or the
other with examples.
The above considerations are evidently no recapitulat—
ion of all existing litterature and Opinions on the
discussed problem; they only tend to throw the lights
on some symptoms from a scientific vieWpoint, thereby
banning out from consideration the personal. Opinion
of the author.
It is to be hoped that anyone who has gathered
cognizance of the objective experiences at the animals,
consult his inner self, whether he wishes to take the
responsibility to take as a guidance the subjective
experiences of his fellow—creatures in determining his
standpoint as regards the socalled electric anaesthesia
of food—animals.

MEASURES AND PRECAUTIONS IN VIEW OF THE

PROTECTION AGAINST CASUALTIES IN HANDLING

APPARATUSES FOR ELECTRIC STUNNING OF
ANIMALS.

by Ir. A.STEGENGA .

Electrotechnical engineer at the Bureau of Labour—
inspection in the Hague.

The protecting measures should be directed towards the
prevention of danger due to transmissions of strong—
current on the person handling the electrode-handle.
In determining the nature of those measures one has to

take into consideration the following:

1. Currents amounting to a fracture of those, which one
generally uses in the technique - even of those by
means of which food-animals are stunned — may be
fatal for men, if on their way through the body
they pass the heart.

The electrode~handle when in use, is held in the
hand, which implies that, if the construction of the
whole is not entirely correct_.portending that if
there is a defect,the apparatus externally comes
under tension-the person handling it will be exposed
to danger.

The unisolated electrodes, serving for the current-
transmission on the food-animal and which will,

when the apparatus is in use be under tension, cannot
be protected against touching without prejudicing

the efficacious construction and the effective action
of the apparatus.

The environment in which the said apparatus are

. . as .
used, is a rule damp. Under these Circumstances

the resistance of the human body will be small,
when the electric current is closed through an un-
expected transmission of the current due to an in—
advertent touch. At the same time the remainder of
the resistances in the said circuit will be diminished.
A damp environment is favourable for the provoking
of internal defects in the apparatuses.

The danger that is being promoted by the said unfavour—

able circumstances, should be restricted as much as

possible through technical precautions in view of safe

operation

 

 




_51_

towards

operation. These should be directedz/- the realizing

of safety to such an extent, that casualties on account
of involuntary actions should be well—nigh excluded.

By efficaciously training of the personnel one may
avoid faulty operations9 due to ignorance.

The technical safety measures, when boiled down9
principally consist of cutting out electrically from
the mains9 the circuit in which the electrodehandle

is involved; furthermore the chances of a short—circuit
in the framework of the electrodehandle will be elimin-
ated as much as possible by a sound construction.
Finally, for any feedingtransformer no more than one

electrodehandle should at a time be put into Operation.

It is of a vital importance that the state of upkeep

of the apparatus should be inspected periodically. This
inspection should be made by an electrotechnical expert—
official.

CONSTRUCTION. ARRANGEMENT AND MORKING METHODS
OF APPARATUSES USED FOR PROVOKING ELECTROSHOCK
AND ELECTRONARCOSIS ON ANIMALS, PARTECULARLY
THOSE THATARE US?) FOR ELECTRIC STUNNING OE
FOOD+ANIMALS.
by
Ir. K.COHEN STUART — Hilversum
Manufacturers of the ELTHER apparatus for anaesthe—

tizing men and animals.

The objectives, serving as a base for the construction
of this apparatus, are to provoke, in an absolute sure
manner, an instantaneous unconsciousness of sufficient
duration, whereby not the slightest painsensation will

be suscitated on the animal and through which an effect—

. f . . . . .
ive and‘possibly, a time saVing running of the industry

is warranted.

Moreover, this method may not give rise to aniinfavour~
able change in the meat.

As, with regards to the provoking of pain on the animal,
no reliable experiences can be gained, it is the most
logic course of things that in determining our attitude
we take bearings on the Electroshock therapy as it is
applied on man.

Yet one may state here, there is a kind of a reciprocal
action between the application on man and that on animals,
There are namely 2 systems in use for the electric
anaesthesia. The first method, which was being applied,
consisted in leading an alternative current of i 7O Volts
during 10—20 seconds through thw brains, This method

was applied for the first time in 1927 on animals by
Prof, MULLER. About 20 years later this system also

found application in the electroshock—treatment on man.
However the tension-then was decreased andzinounted to
about 40 Volts.

The second method was applied for the first time on

man in Rome in 1938 by CERLETTI and BINI. According to
this method an alternative current of 60—150 Volts is
introduced during 1/1O — 1 second through the brains.
Here the unconsciousness and absence of pain has been
thoroughly demonstrated. This method, as regards the

last point, is so effective, that in case it is per—
fectly applied, there is not the slightest remembrance

of the treatment. Iii.

w

It is therefore amazing that this method has been
applied :not earlier than. in 1946 on animals, namely
by Dr. F.W.TERVOERT at the slaughterhouse of Winters—
wijk, The tensions, that are used nowadays on animals,

varies between 150 and BOO Volts, while the periods

   
 

of stunning vary from % to 1% seconds.

Which of the two systems should be applied, depends
upon the kind of food—animals and upon the arrangement
of the slaughterhouse°

That there is talk of a real unconsciousness and in

a certain sense even of a narcosis, has been recorded
later on, without having to take recourse to analogy
with man. By continuing the treatment with a slightly
modified kind of current, with a much smaller energy,
directly after the shock, it appeared to be possible
to perform operations on animals, even deep within the
cavity of the abdomen. The muscles of the animal were
completely relaxed and the animal lay entirely still.
This narcosis can be maintained indefinitely long and
is brOken off immediately, when the current is inter—
rupted°

For the first system a very simple installation will
suffice. Ve start from the alternative current of 125
or 220 Volts, supplied by the mains.

The apparatus consists of two parts. Firstly the appa-
ratus that supplies the current and secondly the tongs
by means of which the current is lead through the brains.
The tension of 70 Volts has been chosen for safety
precautions, Thus in this case the safety provisions
may be of a simpler nature.

The apparatus on itself consists chiefly of a trans—
former, which brings down the tension of the mains
until 70 Volts° Furthermore there will be needed a
mainswitch, for s7itching on the apparatus and a
signallamp that indicates that the apparatus is
switched on.

From the apparatus there are wires going to the stunning-
tongs or stunningstraps or whatever kind of instrument
one wishes to use.

There is reason to draw the attention to the control—
instruments.

The current, passing through the animal's skull should,

when the electrodes are well pressed onto the head,

amount

mm: “39:”

  




-54-

amount to at least 600 milliamperes° Thus when the
apparatus is complete it should involve the use of a
big ammeter, fixed on a distinctly visible place
and whereby the position of 600 milliamperes a red line
or other mark has been applied.

To entirely complete the apparatus, next to this am-
meter a buzzer should be fixed, which comes directly
into action when the strength is above 600 milliampere.
Thus under all circumstances a correct control is
possible. As it appears from the fongoing the entirety
is a very simple installation.

Less simple is the apparatus for the second system.
This consists of a case, in whicthn adjustable trans—
former, whereby at the secundary side tensions are
supplied of 150, 225 and 300 Volts for example.

An adjustable automatic timeswitch, through which the
time of stunning may be adjusted to e, 1 or 1% seconds.
An automaton which switches on the current on the tungs
if the button, fixed in the tongs is pushed in.

A mainswitch with accessory signallamp.

A signallamp, that only burns when the current passes
through the skull°

The service buttons for the one and the other should be
fixed on a panel such that it affords a general view of
the whole.

A buzzer and ammeter as used in the first sy

useless here°

For the very short time that the current passes through
in application of this system,control will be impossible
and an adjustment of the apparatus not well realizable.
Thus the dosing is taken to such extent that notwith-
standing res stances if any, the energy will yet be
sufficient.

With the first system one cannot apply this procedure,
as with the maximum tension of 70 Volts, the necessary
strength of current of 600 milliamperes is only obtained
at a minimum resistance of the skin.

A bad pressing on of the tongs or an evil condition of
that side of the eldctrodes pressed onto the skin, may
already be a cause that the desired dose is not obtained.
It is from a vieWpoint of safety that with the second
system is fixed in the apparatus an extra automaton

to switch on the tension via the push—button° It is

because one wants to prevent the high tension of 150-

BOOhvolts from running through the wiring and through
the

 




-55-

the tungs, when these are not in use°

Through the tongs an extra set of wires run to the
push—button on which there is only a 6 Volts—tension.
When this button is pushed in, then through this 6 Volts—
tension an automaton is switched on in the stunningappa—
ratus, which switches on the high tension on the electro—
des of the tongs. Thus this tension remains at longest

1% seconds on the tongs during the passing of the current
through the skull. .

The tongs, or what other kind of gggégtieﬁﬁis in use,

has to comply with various demands and preferably

adapted to the form of the animal's skull. To start with,
the tongs may not be too heavy and should nevertheless

be of a solid construction.

The isolation of the wires, running through the tongs,
should conform with the most stringent requirements.
Owing to these requirements it is desirable to use
different tongs for the respective kind of animals.

On a demonstration one will thus notice a system, which
strictly speaking are no tongs but an apparatus whose

two halves are shoved one into the other, while a
counterspring provides for the counterpression.

With the hogs the classic model of tomgs is used. In

this case it is necessary to effect the greatest possible
pression because, as has been.stated, most often a tension
of 70 Volts is used. Without a.strong pression on the
tongs the skinrcsistance cannot be brought down to the
desired minimum.

For stunning cattle use is made of straps or a bow,

which is placed from the frontside over the head and
whereby the electrodes, which are making contact with

the hide, are pressed onto it by a Spring.

The push—button for switching on the current, is fixed

as some yards’distance from the bow in the wire leading
to them. This is done for a special reason. If one

switches on the current, then.the animal falls down

instantaneously. In using the tongs, by steadily pressing

at the handles, one could not follow the movement of

the falling down, implying that the time of stunning is
interrupted and consequently the dose strongly diminish—
ed. The current Should go through for 1% seconds.

Also as regards the safety for the personnel, this bow

has its advantages LbOVe the tongs, as the Operator,
after having pushed in the button has to grip nothing
more, The instillation of the stunningapparatus itself
may best be done outside the damp killingfloor, in a
separate room. In this case there will be needed a main-
switch — which puts into operation the apparatus —
and a control signallamp. Then a junction contact for
the junction of the bow is connected with the way—out
of the apparatuso
The apparatus should thereafter be adjusted for the
dose for the corresponding animal,
Of course it is preferable, if the apparatus is only
used for one kind of animal, to have it constructed
for the only one needed dose.
We already pointed out that the dose, in case the
electroshock system is applied, should be kept at the
high side, because the hideresistance with the different
animals is not the same and the control of the period
of input during 1% seconds at maximum is not possible.
If for some reason or other, it seems desirable to
reduce the dose to the minimum, a special system may be
applied, the socalled method of variable Watt—output
as is described in the Psychological and Neurological
papers, year 1942 9 by Dr.BARNHOORN, about the electro,
shock therapy.
On these investigations it has been established, that a
determined quantity of energy is needed for the susci—
tation of an insult. This energy is expressed in Tatt-
seconds, the product of the tension in Volts, the current—
strength in amperes and the period in seconds,
Thus the apparatus has to be constructed such, that the
needed energy may be.adjusted accurately and furthermore,
which is the essential point, that the said energy as
a fact goes through the skull of the animal, rEgardless

of the various hide resistances.

It proved to be possible to comply with thésErequirements

with a deficiency of about 4%, which certainly is toler—

able. From the said eXperiments it appears that this

is obtained by constructing in the circuit of the animal,

an extra resistance equal to the average hideresistance

of the animal°

As the total resistance in the circuit, in which the.

animal is involved, thus has become twice as great, the

tension delivered by the transformer should also be
:wice

 




-37_

twice as high, therefore 600 Volts at maximum. This
circumstance imposes other requirements upon the appa-
ratus. However the tension on the skull of the food—
animal is at any rate no more than BOO Volts.

Much has been written about tension, current strength,
Watt—output, energy etc. To complete the discussion we
shall expound the electrotechnical principéﬁs, which
serve as a base for all these magnitudes and that have to
be taken into consideration in constructing stunning
apparatuses.

Supposing that We stun with an alternatif current of 50
cycles per second, with a tension warying between 70 and
BOO Volts, a currentstrength varying between 0,6 and 2
amperes, an output of 60 to 600 Vatt and during a period
of % to 20 seconds.

In this case the resistance of the foodanimal varies
from 90 to 150 Ohms.

These notions, tension in.Volts, currentstrength in
amperes, resistance in Ohms, stand to one another in

a certain relation, which is expressed by the law of Ohm,
voiced thus: '
tension'

urrcntstren.th:mmmenm=
G g resistance.

This ohmlaw thus means, that the currentstrength is 1
ampere if this current is lead by a circuit upon which
stands a tension of 1 Volt and its resistance is 1 Ohm.
To give an example from the practice, let us take the
case that a foodanimal is being stunned with a tension
of BOO Volts, while the skullresistance is 150 Ohms.
Now the currentstrength is the tension divided by the
resistance, in the supposed case BOO divided by 150 2

2 amperes.

The Watt—output is the product of currentstrength and
tension, in the said case at 2 amperes and BOO Volts 2
600 watts.

A force of 600 Watts means in this case a currentstrength
of 2 amperes at a tension of BOO Volts.

The energy is eXposed in Wattseconds.

If the current goes through during 1% seconds, then the

energy amounts to 600 X 1% 2.900 Wattseconds.

The electric energy has to be conducted from the stunning

apparatus, via the cables and tongs through COpperwire,
which is a conductor of the first degree. Further
through the skull which is a conductor of the second

degree.

he shall have to examine more closely some of these notions.

To start with, what is electricity?Tt was in 1780, that GALVANT
through his famous frogexperiment came into touch for the first
time with the electric symptoms in the living tissues. He believed

he found the Source of life. Extensive experiments however, gave

him no accurate picture of his invention. It was Volta, who,about

1800, made the first element.Nowadays we know more than GALVANT or
VOLTA about electricity, or better phrased, about the carriers of
electricity, the electrons. The smallest buildingstones of the
chemical elements are called atoms.

We are figuring the construction of an atom as a central core with
a positive charge, around which one or more electrons are circling,
which have each a negative charge, such that the whole towards the
outside is electrically neutral. Thus it is a kind of sun-system
in miniature. The charge of one single electron now is the smal—
lest possible quantity of electricity present.

The elements are grouped according to the number of electrons, that
are turning in different fixed tractions around the core. The elec—
tric current is thus a flow of electrons. The electric tension
incited by a galvanic battery or otherwise has to push this flow
of electrons through a conductor.

What is a conductor? There are conductors of the first and those
of the second degree and both kinds are involved in the electric
stunning.

Metals are conductors of the first degree. Let us take for example
copperwire. An atom of copper consists of a central core around
which 29 electrons are circling, in the first, inner traction 2,

in the second one 8, in the third one l8 and in the last traction
only one. This single electron is detached very easily. This de—
taching is called dissociation. The electric balance of the atom
is now broken. There is only left a negatively charged ekrtron

and a positively charged copperatom.

 




 

 

7
-53-

The said negatively charged electrons flow from the negative pol

(D

to the positive one, thus from minus to plus.

Thus the flow of electrons in fact goes in the opposite direction,
contrarily to what has been supposed before.

We shall now take into consideration the conductors of the second
degree, the electrolytes. These are liquids and especially the
watery solution of acids, bases and salts. The tissuelicuids in the
human body are also-conductors of the second degree. Chemically
pure water does not conduct the electricity. However water can
bring to dissociation the molecules of the salts, acids etc. dis—
solved in it.

To be complete, something has to besaid about the running of the
current through the skull. The tissues around the skull offer but
little resistance. The skullbone on the other hand constitute a
much greater resistance. Measurings have been effected, whereby
partly isolated needles have been inserted at diiierent depths into
theskull, to measure the tensions in the inner parts during the
flow of the current.

It has been found out, that on efiecting an external tension of

lOO Volts, internally the tension was only 1 Volt. This tension was
practically eoual at all depths. it appears therefrom, that the
place of adjusting the electrodes was not determined all too ac~
curately.

One can imagine nerves as electric conductors, which are charged
negatively at the innerside and positively at the outside. There~
fore one succeeded in measuring the socalled voltage on open cir~
cuit, which even in a nerve is present. On accurate measuring there
is found a difference of tension of about 1/25 Volt between the
internal and external side of a nerve. it is very likely that

one has to span this voltage on open circuit in order to obtain

an electroshock. One has succeeded subsequently in working with

 




-40-

these tensions on the modern electroshock apparatuses, used in the
human therapy with other Kinds of currents, that come nearer to
the psychologic impulses,

It appears from the foregoing, that the stunning ayperatuses ere

in principle very simple in construction, However the electrotech—

nical and electrophysiologicsl principles serving as a base of this
method are a little more complicated.

By briefly including these subjects in this discussion we have
tried to give as much as possible an entire picture of the diffe—
rent regions of investigations, which are readily involved in the

mere construction of these simpl< apparatu es.

Foodanimals should be killeu by bleeding after preslaughter
stunning.

Until now stunning takes place by means of apparatuses,
through which the great brSins are offended mechanically
and consecuently cons CiouCnCCC is s- spended immediately

We find this apodeitical verdict in art° 8 of the Royal
Decree of June 5th IQLO, Official Gazette No. 285,

l. The object of the mechanical stunning at the slaughter—
house is, without suscitating pains- ensations to provoke
an instantaneous insensi bjlitjf and unconsciousness, that
last for such a period that death through bleeding has
manifested itself°

Does the method, whereby the brains are offended mechanic~
ally to such an {xtent that unconsciousness is provoked,
entirely res pond to this TBCUlTLMGﬂtv

Nob dy knows whether, after the knocking on the lead
after the shot by the captive bolt, this unconsCi ous
is provoked instantaneously or only after a more or
short period.

A certainty on this Cu"oct may scarcely be obtained
with human beings, but it is very probable that they
would effectively feel the knock or the shot.

It is evident, that it will remain difficult to establish
how long_a£l*£pg__; unconsciousn ss with animals is

provoked and for how long it will last.

Everyone who regularly witnesses shooting big food"
animals Cnd abOW sll horses eby captive bolt, must often
wonde r if the mechanical off nsw of the brains does not
cause a terrible pain he pe Latedly one notices horses,
after falling so”, through the shot, lift up head and
neck and then finally sink down headlong through exhauC—
tion.

Even the rea actionC of the animal during the bleeding out
every time and again give rise to the cuestion: Is the
animal really deprived of sensibility?

With man it has been actually cCs,b]CChCe that after the

application of the electroshock, an instantaneous un—

consciousness brought about, that no painsensations
are

 




n r:
"'19-”

are provoked through it 5nd that patients never have
any memory of the whole treatment°

On this ground we nay say, that the judiciously executed
electric stunning of animals should be given preference
to the captive bolt,

5. The electric stunning may only be performed by well
trained persons and with properly functioning apparatuses
Too often, through lack of efficacious supervision, this
method is entrusted to persons, who do not know how

to handle the apparatus, through which an incorrect
execution with injuries for the foodanimal and even
danger for the bystanders will ensue from it.

Guarantees have to be given that the apparatuses are
functioning properly and a regular expert-control of
them should be enforced,

If this is not conformed with, the permit will be with~
drawn. Thus, provided sufficient cooperation and super—
vision from the Chiefs of Service may be relied upon,
an adequate control of this stunning method will be en~
sured. If on the other hand the cooperation appears to
be unsatisfactory, then higher powers should be set to
work and the permit withdrawn,

4. The unconsciousness should last so long that death
through bleeding out is warranted.

Nothing is known about the restoring of consciousness
in case the captive bolt is used. Some experts contend
that such would be theoretically possible.

In case electric stunning is applied however, anyone may
e

c
witn ss that after some time consciousness is restored.
lnfrangibly connected with the requirements of training
and of proper functioning of the apparatus, it should be
imposed that with small animals the bleeding out should
start immediately after the switching off of the current,
while with cattle the throatcut should be effected after
the running movements have come to an end

With regard to the application of the tensions and strength
of current in stunning the various kinds of animals, I
should like to draw the attention to the following.

The Committee A ll (The Board of Council of the Society.
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) has, on demand

of the Direction of the said Society, studied for years

the problem of electric stunning° During this study and

its experiments the said committee has witnessed the
development of two methods, which are regarded as accept~
able.

 




These are;

l. the socalled - shockmethod, whereby during a
short period ; g , iose of electric energy is
administered !

the method of currentapplication, whereby during a
longer period a smaller dose of electricity is
conducted through the brains.

Both methods have found application on man and on its
countless performances it has been_nade fact that the
unconsciousness has been provoked immediately after the
treatment and that the patients have never experienced
painsensations.

There is however one thing 1 would like to str
Although the resistance with man and animal do not
diverge much from one another, in the case of applying
this method on man one takes care not to exceed the
socalled threshold value, such for medical considerations,

With foodanimals on the contrary, one cannot take any
risk as the chances are that no unconsciousness or an
insufficient one may be realized. The issues thereof

are evident. Thus it will be wise to always overdose.

This extra dose is also essential, because in the case of
animals, the hide upon which the poles of the tongs must

be fixed, caus s a greater resistance and the actual active
energy will thus be reduced; the more so because one can~
not make the necessary preparations, like it is possible
with man.

In order to restrict as much as possible the eventual
period, in which possible painsensations may arise,
the aforesaid Committee judged it essential to bind
the strength of current to a determined minimum limit.
We shall hereafter repair to this point.

The said two methods should however not be regarded or
praised as the uniquely beatific ones. There will undoubt-
edly exist other acceptable methods of electric stunning.

BOEING:

These have to be shocked by the shockmethod.

The tension has to be such that when the current is

passing through the great brains during at longest l 1/2

second, the potential energy amounts to at least 400

to 600 Watt~seconds. Of course the electrodes have to

be adjusted properly in order to minimize the external

resistance. On account of safety precautions and in order

to prevent at any price an ill-treatment of the animals,

one has to see to it, that in big slaughterhouses, where
cattle

 




cattle are being slaughtered continuously this electro—
shocksystem always causes an instantaneous unconscious—
ness to this big Kind of animal,

The above dose is eviiently being helc at the liberal side°
We are well aware of the fact, that even with lower
tensions, meaning tlat smaller tuantities of potential
electric energy pass through the brains unconsciousness
asserts itself. The least tolerable cuantity of electric
energy that will actually pass through the brains should

be expressedly prescribe: by law,

These animals shoulﬁ preferably be shocked and with such
a tension that the potential energy passing through the
brains during at longest l l/2 second, will amount to
200 up till 500 Wat ~sec, The same condition concerning
the adjustment of the electrodes has to be observed,

These anima s are also shocke: and with such a tension,
that while administering the electric current during
half a second at longest ~ again provided that the
electrodes be adjusted properly - is potential energy
passing through the brains amounts to 135 up till 250
Wattesec,

A special stunning bench, a socalled slaughtering—piano ~
this device owes its name to its construction r sembling

a piano ~ has been devised for stunning sheep, goats and

bobcalves while lying on their back° lt is essential that
the animals are bled directly after the current has been

cut off,

The said reouirement of instantaneous bleeding may be
analysed into two points°

Under no condition should it be allowei to first stun
a series of animals an: then, some time afterwards,
start to cut the throat of the first stunned animal,
The lapse of time be ween the electric stunning and
the cutting of the throat may not aha need not exceed
a few SGCOHQS, while moreover this is quite well
realizable,

The arteries at the neck should be severred such,

that an effective and continuous bleeeing out is
guaranteed, If someWhere at the electrically stunned
animal only a littls vein is opened, one may be sure,
that consciousness is restored, long before the animal
is dead through bleeding,

metho6, slaughtering by "ope n he Cid” (cross —cut whereby
aorta an6 other arteries are cut open together with the
trachea) is abso olutely necessary. It is a we ll— known fact
that with the so ocalle6 Y”loser hea6 metho6H ( whereby no
cross-cut is mac 1e but a longtiturias1 incision in the
neck in or6er to sgu11e ine hi6e), the ble winC out is
procee6ing too slowly throu h :t gnation of bloorMco agula
in the woun6, by curling up of the intima etc,

An application of this slaughte r1 ng metho6 should therefore
only be permitte6, if by special precautions the woun6

is vvi6ely kept ops n an6 if there is a constant supervision
to ensure a strong flow of bloo6 as effecte6 in the case

of “open hes6" killing, \hcrcby no special precautions

are required.

The lectrosrockmctho“ miy succesfully be applie6 on
these ani :na s. The tension has to be such that when the
current is being introluccc hiring l secon6 ~ again
un6er the same con6itions of a proper a6justment of the
electrodes — the potential energy affecting the brains
amounts from 250 up till 500 Watt—sec.

This metho6 however has its 6isa6 vantage s.

When the hogs are slaLMgitered in a hanging position,

the violent spasmo6ic movements cause6 by the epileptiform
insult, make a ather 6is agreeable impression upon on-
lookers, These mov<1ments also make it impossible to

catch properly the bloo6 Which is use6 for human con~
sumption.

It is for these reasons that the other system of electric
stunning, the one with a lower tension of about 70 Volts
an6 by which the current is a6ministere6 6uring a longer
period (l0 to 25 cacon6 ), is largely preferre6,

In or6er to make sure that the necessary potential
energy is being aiminisdared, an ammeter has to be intro~
6uce6 into the electric circuit. The swtunn r has to see to
it, that the strength oi the currente coeC not 6rop below
600 milliamperes, for othe rwige tye Will be a Great
chance that insufficient UDCOHCLTOUQHC‘S will take place,

This proce6ure of a6mitting the current 6uring l0 to 15
secon6s is applied to realise a complete unconsciousness

minute thereafter.
5. The great certainty, that with electric stunning an
instantaneous and painless unconsciousness of sufficient
duration is obtained, may be put forth as an effective
argument to introduce this method, provided it is law—
fully and judiciously regulated, next to the existing
stunning methods.

The electric stunning is also favoured by economic advan-

tages, which deserve to be enumerated.

a. the costs per animal are lower than when the captive
bolt method is applied. This last system involves the
use of cartridges, which always cost some cents each,
whereas the costs of electric current is practically nil.
Through the captive bolt the brains and its membranes
are offended and thus cause haemorrhages in the brains.
Therefore these organs are not fit for exportwtrade and
even less for hometrade.

Many observations have established that the bleeding out
of electrically stunned animals are not more complete
than in numerous cases of otherwise stunned animals.
Through this the tenability of the meat is favoured.

Based upon the aforesaid arguments it may be stated, that
the well—executed electric stunning particularly from the
viewpoint of preventing ofczruelty foranimals and also seen
from a social standpoint, should be allowed and that it

is the duty of every Chief of the Service to consider if
the circumstances in his service are of such a nature that
zuiadmittancecﬁ‘this stunning method should be supported.

STUNNING—APPARﬁTUSES(tongs etc.).

We can do without a detailed description of the stunning—
apparatus, as many kinds of constructions are realizable.
In general we may say that they should conform with the
following requirements.

Not too heavy, easy in handling and adjusting, and safe

in its manipulation, particularly for the operating person—
nel. Its poles have to be constructed such, that while
stunning, a good contact is assured. This requirement is
imperative for all kinds of animals. Furthermore the poles
should be adjusted_such that the current always passes
through the brains.

Furthermore I VDuld like to lay stress on the following,
particularly in regard to the stunning of cattle.

One has to take into consideration the inevitable difference

in resistance in the various kinds of animals. One may not

 




—46—

not eXpect the same minimum strength of current will

anaesthetize every animal of an equal weight.

More over the resistance will also depend on the state

of the hide under the electrodes and on the pressure
effected by them. It is not always possible to maintain

a firm grip on the tongs when the animal crashes down
heavily. The fatigue of the stunner also plays a role
here.

It is evident that the resistance between hide and
electrode rises when the pressure of the electrodes

on the hide decreases; due to this increased resistance
the needed quantity of Watt-sec. will become insufficient

for an efficacious stunnind. In connexion herewith we

have constructed the socalled "Head telephone" (see

pictures numbers 1a and 1b), of which the electrodes
remain pressed unto the temples, even when the animal
goes down.

Hereunder follow some pictures of the apparatuses used
in Rotterdam, gained by practical experience during a

long stretch of time.

 




1. Stunning cattle.
a. The tongs are ﬁtted on the head, partly resting on its nose; the electrodes are
gripped onto the Cristae Zygomaticae.

 

b. The moment that the electric current ﬂashes through the brains and the animal

falls down unconscious.

 

 




 

 

2. Stunning nob-ca/ney.
The ﬁxing of the electrodes at both sides of the head, While the animal is lying
on its back on the slaughtering-piano.

 

3. Sinnning J/aeep.
The ﬁxing of the electrodes at both sides of the head. These animals are stunned

in the same way as bob-calves.

 

 




4. Stunning nogr.
a. The catching of a hog (left) by means of the tongs, while the animal is running
freely, thus without making use of a catching-pen.
On the right: a stunned hog, that has been exposed to the electric current

during 10~15 seconds, being transported to the bleeding place by means of the
Jacob’s ladder.

 

 

b. For trained personnel it is quite simple — immediately after the hog falls down
when caught by the tongs # to shift the electrode on the upper side of the
head, to the temple beside the eye, thus having the current ﬂow through the
brains along the shortest way.

ELECTRIC STUNNING OF FOOD ANIMALS

Report cf the seminar held on November 27th 1954 on
instigation of the Veterinary Faculty at Utrecht, in the
College saloon of the Hygienic Laboratory, 27 Catherijne—
singel 59 at Utrecht,
by
Prof. C.F.van OIJEN.

The presidence of this seminar, during which the subjects,
printed on the previous pages were treated, was entrusted
to Prof. van OYEN, who inaugurated the event and welcomed
the many veterinarians and guests, namely the members

of the board and the inspectors of the various societies
for the prevention of cruelty to animals. The Speaker
requested those present, who wished to participate in the
discussions, to have their remarks put down in writing.
Only on that condition their observations could be included
in the reports, accompanied by the answers of the discus“
sionleaders.

The president subsequently introduced Dr.M.van der BEEK

 

Director physician of the Psychiatric Hospital "VredenrustN

at Bergen 0p Zoom, as the first speaker.

This physician again in a few words layed stress upon

wkmm he pointed out in his paper with regards to his great
and long experience on the application of electroshock

and electronarcosis with human beings. He discussed the
historical develOpment of these therapeutic measures and
pictured their influence on the various somatic, in par-
ticular on the neurologic, functions of man.

As regards the psychic perceptions of the patients,

 

Dr.van der BEEK emphasized, that patients lose gonsciousness
instantaneously on judiciouswapplication of the_electro~
shock or electronarcosis. Countless times he had been
asked by patients who returned to consciousness, whether
they still_had to undergo the treatment.

He is convinced, that as a rule one may assume, thgtmgn
correct and sufficient administering of the current, there
is on electroshock as well as on electronarcosis, instan—
taneously provoked unconsciousness, with complete amnesia
as to the treatment. The difficulty with the application
on man is the fact, that for various reasons one contrives
to limit as much as possible the administered abctric
energy and that one thus always tries to work with thres—

hold values, that will just provoke a direct unconsciousness.

 




—48-
It must be conceded that, through various contrivances,

one has succeeded in lengthening or shortening this

state of unconsciousness.

Before conferﬁing the floor to Prof.ROMIJN, the president
pointed out, that the proportions in application of the
electric exposure of the animals'skull are different from
those in the case of human beings. In the first case one
should always overdose to such an extent, that the
expected unconsciousness will be obtained with the
greatest possible certainty and that it will last for

a sufficiently long period; anyhow in such a manner

that there will be no immediate electrocution.

In connexion with his paper Prof.ROMI{N again explained
that in judging the effect of the electric exposure of
the animal's skull many difficulties present itself.

Inathe first place he laid stress on the circumstande

that the painperception with animals is developed on a

level different from that of man. He is of the opinion
that on the strength of the investigations effected by
ADRIAN, the encephalogram is useless as detector of
painperceptions.

The speaker opines, that until now, there is lacking an
objective method for establishing the painsensations

of animals. This results in the fact that an application
of the stunning—method of animals (in this case the
exposure of the skull to electricity) is only then
justified, when it may be assumed with certainty, that
man would, under the same circumstances, be exempted
from all conscious painperceptions. The experiences of
psychiaters and neurologists, as described in the paper
of Dr.van der BEEK, are therefore of inestimable value.
Then Prof.Romijn discussed elaborately, why the presence
or suspension of certain reflexmovements, particularly of
the Corneareflex, can be no criterion for answering the
question, whether or not after the skullexposure, un—
consciousness has manifested itself. The pupilreflex

too was fully considered from this viewpoint. (For detailed
informations on these subjects we should like to refer
to the paper of Prof.ROMIJN.)

After having also discussed the symptoms of the muscle
spasms that occur on skullexposure to electricity, Prof.
ROMIJN summarized his discussion as follows:

On the exposure of the animals skull to electricity

there is neither provoked nor suspended a reaction,
which

 




-49-

which justifies a conclusion on anaesthesia of the
substantia corticalis. Thus one is not entitled to
ggsume having proved, that the animals are actually

stunned, because means are lacking to establish_in an

 

objective manner_theiellssed state. A possible applic-
ation may only be justified on the ground of the

 

subjective experiences, as communicated by people

who underwent a similar treatment. Here one encounters

the difficulty, that these persons have no memory at all
as to what they experienced from the treatment.
Theoretically speaking, this does not exclude the pos—
sibility, that these patients have experienced a pain—
perception during the treatment, which perception has

left no memory of it after the end of the experiment;

May anyone, who has taken cognizance of the symptoms

as it may be observed on the animals on electric stunning,
consult his conscience whether he dares to assume the
responsibility to take as a guidance, the subjective
experiences of his neighbours,who underwent this treatment
in determining his standpoint as regards the socalled
electric stunning.

The president then puts On the orderpaper the discusSion
on both lectures just held;

Mr.VEENSTRA (Amsterdam) poses the following question
to Prof,ROMIJN:

'I believe having learned as your insight, that you deem

 

the unconsciousness instantaneous and efficacious when
the animal is struck by the bullet or captive bolt and
that on the contrary this certainty is, on scientific
grounds, lacking in case of the skull's exposure to
electricity. I would therefore ask you — and this question
is certainly not mischievously meant — if you, with
your knowledge and insight, were the director of an
inspectionservice and you would be at liberty to choose
between these both methods (without having to consider
technically- industrial and economic factors), which
would be your choice?

Profo ROMIJN answered that now he was very much constrained

 

to turn himself inside out, but as he was to answer, he
certainly would choose the shot.He illustrated his in—
sight by informing that through the shot there will be
provoked a pressure of about 6 atmospheres and that due

to this high increase of pression there would positively
be

m

 




-50-
be brought about an unconsciousness.
VBTNSTRA thanked him forthis response, which quite
satisfied him. He further remarked that he understood
that Prof.ROMlJN attributes a prickling reaction to the

alternating current, used in electroshock, whereas the

 

continuous current causes a narcotizing effect,as appears
from the electronarcosis provoked on longtitudinally
exposing of the central nervesystem. Would he then not

prefer the continuous current, 6% it were fit for the

purpose?
Prof.ROMIJN then answered that this narcosis—effect did
in fact appear on longtitudinal exposure to electricity

 

but not on skull-exposure.

pr,HOUTHUlS asked the professor if he would give his
personal judgment, whether the electrical skullexposure
with animals could be tolerated next to the captive bolt—
method, as a legally regulated slaughtering method.
Prof.ROMlJN answered in the affirmative, provided it

 

 

were applied on determined and very stringent conditions.
he confirmed that the system, as it is being applied
nowadays in Rotterdam, may be considered as a very reliable
one.

The Chairman of the Sephia-society for the prevention

of Cruelty to animals from Amsterdam, Mr.D.J.WlLLET

opined, that if Prof.ROMIJN cherished this preference,

the Sophiasociety could scarcely agree with the electric
stunning. As a further argument against this method he
pointed out the fact that control on electric stunning
would be very difficult because there is, contrary to the
use of the captive bolt, no hole in the skullcavity.

Thus on inepection afterwards one neVer knows whether or
lnot electric stunning was applied prior to severring

the throat.

‘Qr.HOUTHUIS enounced his regret, that this premature
conclusion had been drawn by Mr.WILLET, while not all
speakers of this day had yet been given the opportunity

to expose their opinion. The speaker therefore asked
Mr.WlLLET to wait until the end of this day before establis—

hing a definite standpoint.

 

This proposal was applauded by the meeting.
Mr.van_hlgﬂ (Rijswijk) then inquired, whether the increase

of the pressure through the shot could provoke a pain—

 

sensation.
Prof. ROMIJN ans )WGTGd that in his opinion the state of

unconsciousness will be so quickly produced, that there
would

 

 




-51;
would be no time left for painperception.
lggvang§AﬂTBN points out that the mainpoint is whether a
foodanimal9 after electric stunningg undergoes a pain—
sensation on the cut of the throat and during its
bleeding out9 in other wordsvﬂnmher the state of unconscious—
ness lasts long enough to institute an actually acceptable
slaughtering method.

MrOKESShhﬁ (Emmen) asks a question similar to the previous

one.

grOfOEQMlq§;answerSthat, if it may be assumed9 that after

 

the electric stunning there is a state of unconsciousness9
this state with the various kinds of animals will only
pass away after a different number of minutes, Therefore
it is of vital importance that the throatcut or knifethrust
in the breast will be e fected immediately after the skull-
eXposure to electricity, So there will develop a quickly
increasing lack of oxygen in the brains. Through this a
greater certainty obtainedg that the transition of life
unto death will take place without conscious perception
by the animal.
EELWAJWJE:BROO¥EAE§ (Utrecht) thereafter poses the follo~
wing questions;
1. Will a,retngrade amnesia manifest itself on the
cardiazolshock?
Dre van derLBEEK answers: in my review I pointed out that
on cardiazolshock in the period between injection and the
commencing of the convulsions there come into being
very diagreeable feelings9 nl. the sensation of dying,
visual and sensational hallucinationso This will involve
that the patient often becomes very much afraid and oppo—
ses violently the treatment. A retmgrade amnesia is not
likely to be produced on the cardiazolshock.
2. The experiments effected by LEDUC and associates are
repeatedly cited in the literature to demonstrate that
it is possible to provoke a state of narcosis by means
of an electric current. When you quoted the LECLERQ
experiments (1910) I believe one may not conclude the
existence of a state of narcosis9 as in the first case
there was an inoperable uteruscarcinoma9 whereby in my
Opinion the possibility should not be discarded that the
function of the respective painfibres was suspended, while
for the rest the uterus seems to contain few receptors
for painexitations9 such that from this case no conclu—
sion can be drawn.

 




-52-

EnyEﬁ der BEEK's answer.
I agree with Dr.BROOYMnNS t at the descriptions of the
Operations performed by LECLLRC, are not convincing as to

 

be existence of an entire insensibility. However TUFFIER
and JARDRY have performed extensive Operations on the
belly of dogs, without there being any reaction. The
Russian investigators HYLAREWSKYI, SLUTCHEVSKYI,

LUVENTSEV and KIRILLOVA described the state of a patient,
who was narcotized for 25 minutes by a Leduc current and
upon whom an appendectomy had been performed.

During the Operation there was no reaction on the incision,
on the eXOiSiOn of the caecum, the further manipulations
of the surgeon and on the closing of the wound.

I myself performed an exciSion of a wart on a patient; he
has noticed nothing of it.

2; By J. HERTZ (1953, Revue Path. comp. 35,.585) 5 experi—
ments have been made on man with the Leduccurrent. In all
these cases, the experimental subjects perceived the admin-
istered painexcitations as they told after the ourremt was
switched off. However these painexcitations were not fol~
lowwed up by motoric-reactions-.

Dr. VAN DER BEEK's.replyz

The experiments by J.HERTZ are unknown to me. If one
peruses the description by LEDUC on the appliCation of
electric current upon himself, then he.saysz " the experi—
mental person was not able to react on the most painful
prickles and could have no contact with.his investigators..
However one should bear in mind, that a very weak current
was being used, viz..35 Volts and 4 milliamperes. LEDUC

 

has not been unconscious, one should better consider this
as. kind of catatonic state.

5.; TIETZ' and associates (1946. J. Nerv. Ment..Dis. 105, 144)
communicate that on the usual position of the electrodes

no adequate "electronarcosis" could be provoked on some
patients,_so that in these cases it was necessary to adjust,
in the next performances, the electrodes a little more
backwardly or frontally.

I should like to be informed of Dr. VAN DER BEEK's opinion
in this respect.

Dr. VAN DER BEEK responds:

It has also been my experience, that, if the electrodes

are placed too far backwards, respirationdisorders

eus) will be provoked earlier; already

.,)

(respirationstc;ea
at a relative low strength of current,such that one could

not administer sufficient current to keep the patient in

a state of unconsciousness. If on the other hand the elec—
trodes are placed too much frontally. then one has to in—
crease the current to obtain a restful narcosis. As a rule
the correct place is on the deepest point of the cavity in
the templearea.

5. Have you ever tried to determine the earliest moment,
a

fter breaking off the electronarcosis or --shock9 upon
which painsensations are again perceived?

Dr. VAN DER DEER answers that he has never made such expe—
riments.

6. May I point out that the term "electronarcosis" has

been used for the first time by BLASIUS and SCHWEITZE
(1893, Pfﬁgers Arch. ges. Rhys. 53, 527)?

Hereupon Dr. VAN DER BEEX remarks: .

I am aware of the fact that HERMANN, BLASIUS and SCHWEITZER

about 1890 have performed experiments with continuous cur~

 

rent on fishes and that they have induced them in a state
of “electronarcosis”. As we were talking here about human
beings and animals of a higher order, I have not memorized
these experiments.

Finally Dr. VAN DER BEEK gave an answer to the questions
about his discussion and emphasized the fact that, on
judicious application of the electroshock or electronar-
cosis, there never appeared to him anything of the pain-
sensations, experienced by his patients, during or after
this treatment. Thereafter the seminar was suspended from
i 12.30 to 13.45 hours.

It should be stipulated here9 that in the general discus—
sion9 following the speech delivered by Dr. Houthuis, some
of the above points were repaired to.

The president Prof. VAN OIJEN reopens the session at 15.45
hours and first grants the floor to Ir. A. STEG—ENGA9 elec~
trotechnical engines at the Department of Labourinspection
(The Hague).

In connexion with the the theses set forth in his paper
the speaker draws the attention to the following;

Currents amounting to a fraction of those, that are com~
monly used in the technique ( and also those used in elec—
tric stunning of food-animals) may be fatal under certain
conditions.

 




  

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
   
  
 

 

 

-54-
If on electric stunning of food—animals, the electrode-

handle is taken in the hand, the respective person will be
immediately exposed to danger when, through a defect, this

instrument comes under tension outwardly.

 

The electrodes which, on account of its nature are not

isolated and serve for currenttransmission on the animal

and which on application of the electric current come under

tension, cannot be protected from touching, without pre-

judicing the efficacity of the construction and the effi—

cient functioning of the instrument.

The damp surroundings, in which these instruments are used,

favour the coming into existence of the said defects.

These damp surroundings decrease the resistance in the

circuit — which circuit will be completed on the actual

operation of smph a defective instrument, by the human

body and otheéﬁkﬁ¥ﬂ%b such an extent, that the said risk

of danger is increased.

On these grounds a regular inspection of the apparatuses

by experts should be urgently required on application of

such instruments.

After this lecture the floor was passed on to Ir. COHEN

STUART, who talked on "Construction, arrangement and work—
methods of apparatuses used in anaesthetizing animals,

either by electroshock or electronarcosis, in particular

those used for food—animals".

The speaker memorized the various regions of investigation,

which are involved in the construction of these apparatuses

and rccapitulated his lecture as follows:

The apparatuses for electroshock and electronarcosis, used

for the stunning of foodwanimals, have to be constructed

such, that the necessary quantity of electricity per time—

unit can be adjusted prOperly and that there will be a

certainty, that this quantity is actually conducted through

the skull of the foodanimal, irrespective of the fluctuat—

ions in the hideresistance of the foodmanimals,

It is of great importance, in the case of the electronar—

cosis, to fit in well-functioning warningsignals (ammetcr,

buzzer) in the electric circuit, warning the Operator

whether or not the actually needed electric energy per

time—unit, is really going through.

Hereafter the discussions on both subjects were Opened.

 




-55-

Mr. VEENSTRA (Amsterdam) believes having noticed from the
lecture by Ir. COHTN STUART, that the last, on the strength
of his observations, doubts the effectiveness of the stun-
ning by means of the captive bolt, which to his opinion
often would be driven insufficiently deep into the brains.
VEENSTRA therefore draws the attention to the fact, that
this does not institute an argument against the stunning
itself by means of the shot or captive bolt, but only
against the fact of incorrect handling or functioning of
such an apparatus. Provided the correct explosive charge
is chosen for every kind of animal, the bolt which is
driven by an exploding cartridge, independently of the
force emanating from the hand9 The—belt penetrates suffic—
iently deep into the brains.

Mr. VAN DIESSEN (Breda) inquires whether a safetytransformer
may be replaced by a box with cartridges for cut~outs.

Mr. STEGENGA answers: A fusebox contains cartridges for

cut—outs for safeguarding the connected conducts behind
the box against short-circuits° A cartridge of 10 amperes
melts at about 30 ampereso From what I have stipulated in
my paper, that a current of about 0,1 amperes is fatal

for man, it is clear that the cartridge for cut~outs is

no safety deviceo The only efficient safety—method for the
said application consists in there, that the electric cir-
cuit, in which are involved the tongs, is isolated from the
ground. This is obtained byiﬂuause of a transformer. This
contains 2 separated coils and thus forms a blocking for
currents through the body of the Operator to the ground.

The said transformer is necessary for other purposes too.
As we know, by means of this transformer the tension of
the mains - which as a rule is not fit for effective stun—
ning - must be adjusted to the correct value, by transform-
ing the current-tension either upwards or downwards. This
may be obtained by the correct choice of the relation
between a number of primary or secundary windings.
Furthermore, on application of the said transformer, there
will be avoided the provoking of a conducter-current run—
ning through the body of the food—animal to the earth,
through which it will be killed.
Mr. WESTERHOF (Bodegraven) informs, that he has applied the
electric stunning on:
bobcalves (shockmethod 180 Volts). It appears, that on

 

 

application of the so—called closed~head-slaughtering (

by thrusting a knife into the breast, in order to spare

the hide), the bleeding lasts too long. bith some animals
the consciousness is restored, before death through bleeding
is a fact. The slaughtering by ”Open head" (cross—cut of

the neck) implies a devaluation of the hide.

He believes that electric stunning of bobcalves, for the
slaughteringmethod in the industry of which he is manager,
is not fit for the practice.

b. sheep (shockmethod 180 Volts). This system works perfectly,
because in this case the cross—cut of the neck is applied.
ho s, whereby a tension of 70 Volts was applied. It appeared
that only a small part of the current (200 milliamperes)
went through the brains. Then he had had removed the earth-
connexion of the safety-transformer and thus obtained better
results.

He would like to be enlightened on the principles underly-
ing this change.
Ir. STEGENGA supported by the informations of Mr. KASBERG

 

answers:
The earthing of any point of the secondary winding of the
transformer in question, should be avoided. In the case
pointed out by Mr. WESTERHOF (see fig. 3) the current from
one of the halves of the transformerwinding is being partly
conducted to the earth by the body of the animal lying on
the damp floor° If the transformer has only such a capacity
merely sufficient for the stunning, then a tensionfall at
the electrodes may be produced, such that the energy for

an efficient stunning will become insufficient. If on the

other hand the transformer is more powerful, then there
will

will be a risk, that the animal will be killed by the cur—
rent going through its body to the earth.

Hereafter the president gave the floor to Dr.}KHNEUIS
(Rotterdam), who gave some clarifications on his paper
entitled ﬁthe slaughtertechnical, social and other motives;

explaining; why it is desirable to allow under stringent control the

electric stunning of foodanimals, next to the existing
lawful stunning methods.

After the discussions which were held on a hight scientific
level, the speaker wanted to return to the daily practice
of this important problem. The reason why he is promoting
the electric stunning, is due to the fact that this method
‘has found an extensive application as therapeutical means
ion man. Dr. VAN DER BEEK has expounded that:

1. Man is immediately unconscious, when a sufficient electric
energy is administered.

2. On the complete electroshock the patient loses conscious-
ness instantaneously.

5. There is no memory at all of a disagreeable sensation or
pain. In this connexion the speaker wants to lay stress on
the name of the retired director of the slaughterhouse of
Winterswijk, Dr. TERVOERT, who since 1946 has never lost
his faith in the shockmethod, as far as the big foodanimals
are concerned.

He was the man, who induced the speaker to look — also for
the big foodanimals — for a system, which may be applied
without danger for men nor for animals and it is Dr. TER—
VODRT, who must be considered as one of the pioneersof our
country in this field.
Dr. HOUTHUIS then discusses the captive bolt, i.e. the
mechanically offending of the brains. On applying this
method the snout-, ear—, tailreflex and that between the
hooves, remains.

It

It sometimes occurs, that a hog that has been shot and has
seemingly entirely bled out, still shows violent movements
when it is drOpped into the scalding water,

At some slaughterhouses there still exists the procedure

to further destroy _ by means of the Spanish rush going
through the bullet—hole — the brains and the Medulha oblong—
ata. Thus on witnessing the violent reactions of the animal,
one should wonder, particularly if one is ignorant of the
subtile brainmechanism, whether all this proceeds without
pain.
When abroad, Dr. HOUTHUIS has witnessed the slaughtering

of cattle, which was being knocked down by striking on

the back of the neck by means of a pinhammer. Then, through
the frontal part of the skull a hole was knocked in the
skullcavity, such that there can be no talk about overpres-
sure in the braincavity.Thereafter the hornroots, together
with a part of the skullroof, were being knocked off by
means of a hatchet; all these actions were performed be-
fore the animal was bledo The animal contorted itself in
agony and tried to escape from this torture and finally

it curved its hindlcgs under the body to try and jump up°
The chain that one tried to fasten around one hindleg, in
order to bleed the animal in a hanging position, was kicked
away several times before one succeeded in it.
When one learns the experiences of neurosurgeons, that they
Open the skull of patients under local narcosis and that
the bones as well as the brains are quite insensitive;

hat big parts of the brains can_be removed without the
patient, who is entirely conscious, indicating any pain,
until at the side of the brains in the environment of the
big arteries suddenly pain is felt, then one is bound to
wonder, whether this violent resistance of the animal,
when it is shot and all sorts of reflexes remain present,
must not lead us to ponder if all this proceeds without
pain. Anyhow, if only one tenth of these so-called reflex—
movements were to be noticed on the electrical stunning of
the big animal, he would not hesitate to immediately put

an end to this method.
When next to that we consider a patient suffering from
epilepsia falling down against a glowing stove and burns
himself seriously without feeling any pain, then we may
assume, that in such a case the person in question is fully
unconscious.

 




-59-
When the correct strength of current is administered through
the animal's skull,which dose is always kept at the large
side, then in the case of electroshock there will be pro—
voked an epileptiform insult, thus in analogy with man, an
unconsciousness.
Let us now examen th: reactions of cattle after the stunning,
The eyes are closed, the third eyelid protrudes, the legs
are contracted under the body and the animal falls down as

if, stricken by lightning, with the head lightly drawn

backwards. There is produced an absolute insensibility and
the animal reacts upon no excitation whatsoever. Even the
tailreflex is absent. Hereafter there is, similarly as with
man, a period of running movements with the members, which
period as a rule is restricted to a few seconds. Thereafter
the members are stretched out, whereby the muscles of the
members feel somewhat tense.

As soon as the running movements have come to an end, the

neck is cut crosswise, whereby the skin, neckarteries and

aorﬁa are entirely out cpcn, thus securing a continuous and
unrestrained bleeding out. In the meanwhile respiration is
~restored and the heart keeps on beating until the animal is
entirely bled out.

The blood is pressed out powerfully, such that the bleeding
passes on stormily.( The blood is spouting out about 8 yards).
The total quantity of_drained blood is much greaterwonﬂelec—

 

tric stunning than when the captive bolt is used.

For that reason too the wholesale dealers prefer the elec~
tric stunning. Besides there is a distinct differende in.
the colour of the outstreaming blood between the two stun—
ning methods. ( When the animals are stunned electrically
the blood is light red, in case the captive bolt is used

it is dark red).

Dr. LUXWOLDA (Zeist) getting thefloor, says:

After having read the papers and hearing the lectures;
having also witnessed the practical demonstrations, I feel
convinced that the electroshock on cattle and sheep is a
useful and humane method and that, on the strength of my
experiences at two slaughterhouses, this shockmethod may
also be safely applied on hogs, next to the 70—Voltsmethod
of electronarcosis.

I applaud the circumstance that serious endeavours will be
undertaken to put an end to the wild application of electric
current on stunning foodanimals, through binding this method

to stringent regulations as regards the apparatus and its
manner

 




-50-
manner of application.In this society I need not cite ex—
amples to prove that, due to the fact that there are no
binding prescriptions with regard to electric stunning,
its application by untrained peOple and with apparatuses,
which are not always perfectly constructed, remains unsat—
isfactory.

Provided that it is possible - not only to give adequate

prescriptions but also to control effectively its applicat—
ion, to such an extent that the application may be called
efficacious — I believe that it would be quite justified,
to admit the electric stunning. However I would like to
draw the attention to the fact, that in case of electrical—
ly stunning of hogs ( and sometimes also after the electro-
shock on cattle) there may be produced musclebleedings,
either in the neckmuscles, or in the diaphragm and the
bellymuscles, or in the longissimus dorsi and in the
muscles of the hindlegs°

On mechanical stunning these haemorrhages also occur and
my experience is that they are due to trauma of the stems
of the necknerves on the place where they come out from
the intervertebral holes (Foramen intervertebrale).

As they are always inherent to a shotdirection, which is.
not aimed towards the back of the skullbase, but more ver-
tically to the base of the brains, one has supposed, that
in that case the concussion of the shock propagates itself
along the bones of the braincase unto the neckvertebrae.
If the shot lies in the prOper direction, such that the
spinal marrow serves as a buffer, then the haemorrhages
will not occur, Thus, in case of mechanica stunning one
has a plausible explanation for the coming into existence
of haemorrhages.

Now it is a fact, that on electric stunning there are also
provoked haemorrhages at times. Until recently I was con~
vinced, that they were due to a faulty apparatus and all
the more I was sure of it, as it was always possible to
remedy the haemorrhages by repairing the apparatus°

‘Of late howeVer, a few cases have induced me to doubting.
At a big slaughterhouse there suddenly occurred haemor—
rhages on stunning with the 70-Volt apparatus. All kinds
of measurings have been performed and there were found no
divergencics in the apparatus. In a big meatindustry the
70—Volt apparatus was in a very bad condition; it has been
repaired, however without result; then an electroshock~

apparatus was used, but the number of the musclebleedings
remained

 

 




-51-
remained constant, about 10%,
Is there, such is my question, any causal relation between
the coming into existence of musclebleedings and the elec—
tric stunning? If so, how can it be explained? If not, what
then is the cause? Has one to think of a certain disposit—
ion on account of race, feeding, care or transportation?
This, taking into consideration my experience, is not
plausible. I have found the bleedings in tired hogs and
also in those that have had a good rest, Similarly in
animals of different origin.
It is a remarkable circums ance that on successive inspec-
tion of an abattoir, of an exporting-wholrsalers and of
a big meatindustry, at which killingplaces the 70-Volts-
method was also being applied, it appeared that the number§
of musclesblcedings also amounted to about 10 per cent.
I need not stress the economic importance of these haemor—
rhages and thus, before electric stunning will be lawfully
admitted, it will be necessary to closely examine whether
or not there is a relation between stunning and the haemor~
rhages. In the affirmative case we must consider the pos-
sibility of avoiding the haemorrhages by changes in the
apparatus; if there is no relation, then it will be of
great economic importance for the meattrade, particularly
for the exportation of porc, to look for the origin of
haemorrhages.
In connexion with LUXWOLDA's informations about the sudden
occurrence of the manifold musclebleedings in some slaugh—
teringhouses, where electric stunning is applied, VEENSTRA
wishes to observe that he on the contrary, introduced the
electronarcosis in the slaughterhouse of Amsterdam, in
order to get rid of the frequent musclebleedings caused by
the captive bolt° he assured he .as been very succesful
in doing so.
Dr. DE GRAAFF (Utrecht) supports this information.
Prof. VAN Oldgﬂ also wonders if in certain cases, one must
take into consideration the nature of the hog, disposed to
musclebleedings.
Even the suction-knife has been for a moment held as res~
ponsible for the bleedings, but Mr. FRICKERS(Zaandam),
where this knife is used, rejects this possibility.

 

Mr. P. VAN RIJN(Rijswijk) asks the following questions:
Is there some information on the changes of bloodpressure

during the mechanical respectively the electrical stunning

to draw.therefrom some conclusion as regards the possible
. cause

 




—62-

cause of the muscleblecdings?
Could any one enlighten me more on the subject of the caus—
es, why on some animals compressionfractures arise and on
others not?
bould it be possible that the above may bx due to the
defects of the apparatus, which are unknown to us?
Dr. HOUTHUIS persists in his opinion - taking into account
the great number of slaughterings of hogs. that have at
the Rotterdam slaughterhouse been stunned for years with
the 70—Voltsmethod, without using the catching~pen, thus
while the animals are running freely and whereby muscle-
bleedings practically never occur — that the bleedings
must be due to:

a. an unsuitable apparatus (either transformer or tongs) or

b. an incorrect administering of the current.

Under signs of approval from the meeting then Dr. TERVOLRT
(Winterswijk) gets the floor. He observes the following:
According to the informations of Prof° ROMIJN, the reflex
of the eyelid, cornea and pupil9 does not serve as a base
for assuming a state of unconsciousness of the animal.
When the animal does not react on the respective prickles.
this9 it is said9 does not imply that there would be no
painpereeption.

Nothing has been said on the reflexes of stout, tail and
on pricking between the claws. Are these reflexes to be
considered as equivalent? What about it9 if after stunning
by means of the captive bolt the animal reacts on these
excitations?

Prof° ROMIJN concludes that the merit of stunning of ani—
mals may only be judged upon the inner experiences of man°
‘bith the electroshock—stunning a great dose of electric
energy is being conducted in a very short time9 be it with
human beings or in animals. On judicious application there
will be provoked an epileptiform insult that proceeds as
such and may be recognised by its symptoms. Consciousness

is rbsent. At these signs one may notice either with man

or with the animal, that an epileptiform insult is evident.

The dose to provoke an epileptiform insult in the animal
is a few times the dose needed for man.

With the electronarcosis a relatively little dose is con~
ducted through the brains during a longer period9 for in~
stance 10 to 20 seconds. If the inceptive dose is too
little, then consciousness is not absent° This has been

experienced

 

 




-53-
experienced by Prof. LEDUC when he applied on himself a
current of 55 Volts.
Dr. BEEK has the same experiences with some of his patients
when the initial current was too low.
From 1940 to 1944 I have been performing the electronar—
cosis on hogs, sheep, goats and cattle with a tension of
70 Volts, during 45 seconds at the beginning, thereafter/3
seconds.
I have had much trouble with raisin-shaped haemorrhages
in the muscles. In 1945 a tension of 110 Volts was applied,
first 18 seconds, then 2 seconds. The results were favour—
able. In 1946 I made contact with COHEN STUART Ltd. at
Hilversum, which firm has constructed the ELTHER—electro~
shockapparatus for animals.
I wrote an article on my experiences, which have been pub~
lished in the Medical Journal.
In using a current of 70 Volts I got the impression, that
the animal is not always unconscious, at least for the
first seconds.
When this method is applied on man, about 40 Volts are used;
for animals 70 Volts are required. In order to provoke an
epileptiform insult on the animal a dose is required which
exceeds many times the dose for man. The animal is less
susceptible than man to electric stunning.
On application of the electronarcosis the inceptive dose
will be too low. Thus they will not always be unconscious.
Alas, with the electronarcosis we are missing a similar
criterion as in man, when the electroshock is applied.
The lying still of the animal does not warrant anything
about its unconsciousness or its insensibility. Through
the exposure to electricity it is, same as with man,
powerless to give expression of its perceptions. All its
muscles are in the grip of the current.

Mr. VEENSTRA asks why Dr. Houthuis has not, in case of

cattle, placed the electrodes on the temples, like it is

done with man, for at that place the current is conducted
most conveniently through the brains.

Dr. HOUTHUIS says that he has in fact nevertheless chosen
the cristae zygomaticac, which are not as good conductors,
because then the Operators have fixed points to work on,
which will give no rise to Inistakes. Moreover these prote
ruding parts offer a firm grip for the electrodes.

A ain

 




-54-
Again Dr. HOUTHUIS emphasizes the fact, that an immediate
bleeding out is essential to avoid restoring of the cons—
ciousness prior to the death through bleeding.
With cattle, which manifest running movements, one should
wait until these movements have passed away before the
throat is out.
In practice cattle and fat calves are shocked during 1%
seconds with such a tension, that the electric energy pas—
sing through the brains will amount to 400—600 Watt~sec.,
respectively ZOO-BOO Watt—sec.
Bobcalves, sheep and goats are shocked during 1 second,
whereby the energy amounts to 125—250 Watt—sec.
On hogs the electroshock may also be applied during 1
second. Here the electric energy abunts to 250—300 Watt~sec.
However, if these small anima s are bled in hanging posit—
ion, the spasms arising with the shockmethod, make a dis—
agreeable impression . Thus the electronareosis with a
tension of 70 Volts and lasting for 10 to 15 seconds is
preferred. For this purpose the controlling by means of
an ammeter and soundsignal is necessary.

This method warrants a complete unconsciousness and immo—

bility during the bleeding out. he stretching of its hind
legs is proof for a sufficiently deep narcosis.

Mr. SMIT, inspector of the SOPHIA—society for the preven—
tion of cruelty to animals explains in a lengthy discourse

that the electrical stunning is unfit for general applicat—

 

ion, because:

this method necessitates the use of too complicated appar—
atuses, which may too easily get defects in industries like
slaughterhouses,

this system leads to eluding the regulations, also because
the control afterwards is not possible.
With the mechanical stunning on the other hand, the control
is quite realizable through the hole in1iﬁ-skull.
The conception of Mr. SMIT's speech and his choice of words
are of such nature, that Profo ROMIJN is obliged to signal
their inadmissability and, with the approval of the audience,
demands from the president that this speaker be withdrawn

he floor.
The president cannot agree with this suggestion bearing to
the restricting of the free speech and invites Mr. SMIT

to express, whatever he has to say, in a more suitable form.

Reacting on what has been expounded by Mr. SMIT,

 




—65—
Dr. HOUTHUIS denotes his regret, that the chairman of the

 

SOPHIA—society is no more present, who very likely would
have given an other version of the question. Dr. HOUIHUIS
emphasizes that Mr. SMIT's opposition is detrimental to
the interests of the foodanimals.

 

Nowadays the electric stunning is being applied quite il—
legally, wrongly and insufficiently. The objectives, that
are being striven for at present, are to give a lawful
base and to create a guarantee that the system will only
be executed judiciously under stringent control. It is for
these reasons that the Netherlands Society for the Preven—
tion of Cruelty to Animals, lead by its eminent chairman,
the late Mr. VAN POELGEEST, has tackled this problem.

Dr. KESSENS (Emmen) inquires whether there are guarantees
that the complete bleeding out is so timely, that death

is fact, before the animals would have returned to con-

soiousness.

Prof. ROMIJN, again obtaining the floor, praises the Rot—
terdam slaughterhouse. The speaker has no objection in
having the electric stunning lawfully admitted. he also
advocates an immediate and rapid bleeding out. In view of
the forceful spouting of the blood, he is convinced, that
hypoxia (shortage of oxygen) will very quickly arise in

the brains. He comments as follows:

It is of fundamental importance, that the bleeding of the
animal takes place as quickly and completely as possible
after preslaughter stunning, in order to "catch up" the
initial narcosis, be it through the captive bolt or through
electric stunning.

To ascertain this, it will be necessary to apply the entire
cross—cut of the throat, whereby the big arteries as well
as the great veins are severred, to such an extent that a
free bleeding is warranted. The quick fall of bloodpressure,
which will result from this, will diminish the circulation
in the arteriae vertebrales to such a degree, that a
hypoxia in the brains must follow within a short time.

I do esteem it of importance that also the great venae

are severred, in order to prevent damming of the blood in
the great sinuses, through which there would be an eventual
spare quantity of oxygen.

In regard to the remarks from the above society for the
prevention of cruelty to animals, the speaker stipulates,
that the electric stunning as it is being practised now—

adays at the Rotterdam Abattoir is an elegant and accept-
able

 




-66...
acceptable killingmcthod, n I will not Oppose a lawful
admittance of this SyStem",
MT. WESTERHOF finilly points out that the "open—head"—

.{illing, which is being sponsored in the case of electric

 

stunning, implies the devaluation of the hide. (5 percent
on bobcalves, that is about 50 cents apieCe).

The slow bleeding out when the "closed-head" system is
applied, should at any rate be avoided, if the electric
system is generally introduced.

It is eveident, that the regaining of consciousness through
a too slow and therefore too lengthy bleeding out should
not be allowed.

Dr. HOUTHUIS reﬁnawhstlmt now it must be clear to all, who
have attended this meeting until the end, how near the

 

viewpoints from champions and Opponents have come to one
another.

Prof. VAN CIJEN, then taking the floor, reminds the audience
that the object of this meeting was to consider the pro and
contra of the skulleXposure to electricity, as a means of

 

anaesthetizing.foodanimals. The arguments for both view-
points have been confronted here on a scientifically war—
ranted level.

We have all spitefully witnessed, how the uncontrolled apu
plication of this method has been leading to embarrassing
positions. It is time now that one produces the courage to
either entirely prohibit this method of electric stunning
or to admit, only in certain meat-industries and under a
strict supervision of the apparatuses and the Operators.
If the regulations are not obserVed, then steps will have
to be taken, regardless of the subsequent penalty from the
Court of Justice.

It is up to their Excellencies, the Ministers, charged with

the execution of the Meat—inspectionlaw and of the corres~

ponding articles of the Cattle—law, to answer.
Dr. HOOGLAND (Breukclen), Chairman of the Society of
Chiefs of Meatinspectionservices, expressed, in the name of

 

the audience, his gratitude to the Faculty for this most
interesting meeting and also thanked Prof. VAN OIJEN, upon
whose instigation this has been organised, for his eminent
leadership.

In kind wording the speaker paid tribute to Dr. TERVCERT
as the pioneer of the electric stunning and to Dr.HOUTHUIS
for his efforts, crowned by so much succes, to develop the

electric

electric stunning to such a height of efficiency in its

b. an apparatus by means of which an alternative current
of 50 Hertz and at least 600 milliamperes will be
administered during 10 - 15 seconds through the brains.
A distinctly readable milliamperemeter for the stunner
as well as a buzzer which by a buzzing sound indicates
when the current has attained the said minimum value,
has to be fixed in the electric circuit of the appa-
ratus. A

The apparatus described in paragraph 1 under b, shall be

capable to develop a potency of at least 60 Watts at a

The electrodes shall be placed on the animals' head

such, that the current will run along the shortest way

through the brains.

In case of hogs that are not kept in a fixed position

by means of a catching—pen, one electrode may be pressed

behind the ear and the other electrode at the other

side of the head beside the eye.

'During the administering of the current, care has to

be taken that a constant contact of the electrodes

with the animals head is ensured.

It is prohibited to moisten the electrodes.

Article 10.

When electric stunning by means of an apparatus designed
'in art. 4 has been effected, a cross—cut of the throat
~.as to be made immediately after cutting off the electric
circuit, taking care that the hide, the artery and veins
of the throat will be entirely out Open in order to
ensure an unimpeded and continious bleeding out; in case
of hogs the breast may be cut open lengthwise.

When electric stunning by means of an apparatus described
in.art.5, paragraph 1 sub b, has been effected, the hog
should be killed by bleeding out as soon as possible,

{in any case within 1 minute after the electric current
has been out off.
