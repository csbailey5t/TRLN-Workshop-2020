PRESIDENTS’ GREETING

To our members and guests:

It is our distinct pleasure to welcome everyone in attendance
to this, the first joint meeting of the World Small Animal Veteri—
nary Association and the American Animal Hospital Association
at it’s 32nd Annual Convention. We cordially invite you to take
part in all the professional and recreational activities.

The scientific program is extensive and sufficiently variable
to meet the interests of all attendees, with special emphasis on
those subjects of value to the practitioner. With participating
speakers from nine countries we can expect a new and far
reaching liaison to be established in international veterinary
medicine.

We recommend to you the historical and scenic advantages
of the Nation’s Capitol, and especially for the ladies, the planned
tours to the White House, the foreign embassies, and other points
of interest. Tours to suit your personal interests may be arranged
at the tour desk in the registration area.

Join with us at the Opening Session on Monday afternoon to
honor the Special guests and award recipients.

conceived and carried out in the interest of all
dogs have already won for it recognition as one
ofdthe great dog institutions in the United States

thousands of questions on almost every conceiv-
able dog topic. If you need answers to any ques-
tions (except those of a veterinary nature) about
your dog or dogs ingeneral, write or come to the
Gaines Dog Research Center, 250 Park Avenue,

catalogue of dog literature published by and avail—

both groups. Read the descriptions carefully and

16MM Dog Films. The Center maintains what is prob-

crease attendance at meetings of the group you

Persons who feel they have interesting or unusual
dog information to impart are urged to list them-
selves with the Bureau, giving their qualiﬁcations,

Advance electron micrograph and X-ray dif-

structure of viruses, and made it possible to
convert the symptomatic into a more useful
classification system based on their cubic, heli-
cal or complex structural symmetry.

Dr. Victor Cabasso and his Cyanamid col-
leagues have contributed much to this all-out
endeavor. Their findings, together with those
of other workers in the field, have been com-
piled in Cyanamid’s striking educational ex-

hibit which will be unveiled at the American
Animal Hospital Association’s convention in
Washington this month. This is the first time
that all of the current findings have been sum-

PANEL

 

 

VETEC Editorial Panel
members are (left to right):
Aaron Leash, DVM, Gerald J.
Miedema. DVM and James
H. Rosenberger. DVM.

The Panel's obiective —

to discuss and analyze
important subiects affecting
both the practitioner

and the profession.

 

 

Mutual Understanding—
Key to Building Client Image

REATING A GOOD image with the new

client is vital to the veterinarian. Unless
proper steps are taken to accomplish this goal,
the new client is likely to be in for a shock.
Most people look upon the veterinarian as a
humanitarian, at ﬁrst. Then, they are often ap-
palled by the initial costs involved in safe-
guarding the health of their animals. A client
who is discouraged with the cost of immuniza-
tion, may never return. All he remembers is
that the vaccination may have cost $10.00,
perhaps more than the family doctor charges
to immunize a child. The client may not un-
derstand that part of this fee compensates
for the veterinarian’s professional knowledge
and expenses involved in operating a hospital.

In his efforts to enhance his humanitarian
image should the veterinarian lower his fees?
Surely, the practitioner deserves his fee for
providing a service; but he must recognize that
if it appears to be excessive to the client it
may reﬂect on his professional image. Mem-
bers of allied professions have also experienced
this problem.

Veterinary college provides the student
with a professional education. Unfortunately,
he is not as well advised on his role as a busi-
nessman. As a consequence, the veterinarian is

frequently caught in the middle — sandwiched
between the professional and economic as-
pects of his practice. Are these areas mutually
exclusive? Must a choice be made? We think
not.

The veterinarian should ask for the fee he
deserves even While seeking to establish rap-
port With a new pet owner.

The key is understanding. The veterinarian
must recognize that the client may not under-
stand:

. His role as a medical practitioner and the
service he provides.

0 That the veterinarian’s recommendations
are based on ability, training and knowledge.

0 That the veterinarian is not only interest-
ed in the health of the animal but that he
also understands the needs of the client.

0 That while the veterinarian sympathizes
with the client’s emotional involvement with
the animal, he can still advise objectively.

Every veterinarian, whether he is engaged
in small or large animal practice, must help
the client understand that the fee being
charged is for the DVM’s professional knowl-
edge and ability. It is not merely for me-

chanics. @

Comments Welcomed

I believe the VETEC “Case Book of Proﬁt-
Producing Ideas,” coming in January, really hits
home!

When a client has owed me money for six
months or more, I feel that said client is using my
money interest-free. I am not referring to hard-
ship cases, but, I am referring to clients whose
credo in life seems to be “Don’t pay a bill until
you have to.”

Drug stores and other veterinary supply out-
lets specializing in animal health products, animal
biologicals and feed additives can have this type
of client (on a silver platter) with my blessing.

I read your magazine from cover to cover and
ﬁnd it full of many good ideas that mean the
difference between a proﬁt on veterinary services
or a minimal proﬁt —— namely, just breaking even.

In reference to the article about the used Castle
dental lamp by Roland C. Oliver, DVM, in the
January, 1965 “Case Book of Proﬁt-Producing
Ideas,” I would
like to add that
the bracket may
be reversed and a
12” by 1%." pipe
ﬁtted with a flange
so it may be at—
tached to the ceil-
ing. It is far more
versatile and out of
the way/(see photo).

Regarding a letter that appeared in the Janu-
ary, 1965 issue, from James R. Collins, DVM, of
Houston, Texas. Dr. Collins stated in his letter
that “the writer in favor of conservatism (“The
DVM and the Election,” October, 1964) was an
employee of the state.” Please be advised that
I am not and have never been an “employee of

the state” but I am in private practice endeavorr

ing to make a living in the free enterprise system.

_ Having a ten-month-old practice, I appreciated
the letter by Dr. Sattell in your January issue.

cerned that my practice was grossly below average.

Ever since Tissuvax-4,

7 it’s been easy to

protect dogs against

distemper, hepatitis and

tivo kinds of leptospirosis.

Tissuvax vaccines now come to you with the
diluent in the cylinder of an ultra-convenient, dis-
posable syringe. You don't have to sterilize syringe
or needle, you don’t have to withdraw diluent from
a separate vial, and you’re sure of a sharp new
needle for every injection.

So, now with Tissuvax vaccines, it’s easier
than ever to protect dogs against distemper, hepa-
titis and both forms of leptospirosis.

Tissuvax is America's most-used distemper
vaccine because of its safety, potency, and stabil-
ity. Safety, because it contains a non-virulent,
non-transmissible modified live virus. . . because
it cannot transmit “passenger viruses" path-
ogenic to dogs . . . because it is virtually free
from foreign protein. Potency, because it produces
the highest levels of protection against distemper
ever reported. Stability, because even under stor-
age at 100° F. for 35 days (the equivalent of 2%
years of normal storage) it remained fully potent.

Tissuvax D-H® protects dogs against both
distemper and hepatitis. The distemper com-
ponent is the same as in Tissuvax. The hepatitis
vaccine is a modified live virus propagated in
porcine tissue culture. The effectiveness of the
combination has been demonstrated by antibody
response as early as 5 to 8 days after injection.

Tissuvax-4 is all that Tissuvax DH is, and
then some. It protects dogs against distemper,
hepatitis and two kinds of leptospirosis with one
2 cc. dose. The leptospira component is composed
of equal parts of the lysed whole culture bacterins
of Leptospira canicola and Leptospira icterohemor-
rhagiae organisms which have been killed and
stabilized.

Tissuvax vaccines are still unsurpassed in
safety, potency, and stability. And now they’re
the most convenient, too. You’ll find use in your
practice for all three forms:

TISSUVAX" (Canine Distemper Vaccine, Chick Tissue Culture Origin)

TISSUVAX D-H* (Canine Distemper Vaccine, Chick Tissue Culture Origin,
Hepatitis Vaccine, Porcine Tissue Culture Origin, Modified Live Virus.

New Veterinary Division

A Division of Veterinary Medicine in Health,
Education and Welfare, is still under study
at this report. The division would be a part of
a reorganization plan for the Food and Drug
Administration’s Bureau of Medicine.

lnspectiOn Work to Go Up

Heavier inspection workloads as a result of
an increase in production of meat and poultry
products, are foreseen in the Presidential
budget just transmitted to Congress. The budg-
et report said the number of establishments
having federal meat inspection will go from
1,760 in ﬁscal 1965 to 1,842 in ﬁscal 1966,
for which funds are now being sought.

The report also revealed plans for a re-
quest from the White House for legislation to
ﬁnance directly the full cost of meat and poul-
try inspection, as well as some other inspection
and grading services by a system of direct

charges on the using industries -- that is, meat

and poultry.

At the same time, the report indicated that
a number of research and related facilities,
and research programs in animal and poultry
diseases, will be wound up in ﬁscal 1965.
Among these .are' the animal disease laboratory
facilities at Ames, Iowa, and facilities at sev-
eral state experimental stations.

Apart from federal budget requests, other
portents of increased demand for veterinary
personnel inspection work are seen in Con—
gress. First, at least two bills in the Senate and
in the House, will push for closer state in~
spection requirements with federal-state col—
laboratiOn in this activity. The principal fea-
ture of the House legislation would permit fed—
eral cooperation with states that have mini-
mum standards of inspection and permit con-
tracts with state groups and use of the federal
seal as .an assurance to consumers. It was
pointed, out that only half a dozen states

' 12 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

have adequate state inspection laws although
80 percent of meat is properly inspected. The
Senate bill is a companion bill to the House
measure.

Bill Proposes DVMs

Receive Service Credit

House Bill H.R. 2237, now before the Com-
mittee on Armed Services, would provide au-
thorization of four years’ constructive service
credit to veterinary ofﬁcers now on active duty
with the uniformed services. Veterinarians
hereinafter appointed as veterinary ofﬁcers

» would be so credited under the legislation pro—

posed by Rep. Price (Illinois, Dem.).

SBA Business Keeps Rapid Pace

Small Business Administration continues to
do a ﬂourishing business in the veterinary
ﬁeld. Newest listings show pet suppliers to
an animal husbandry service, located from
California to Maryland, have submitted ap—
plications for SBA loans.

Fish and Game Gains Importance

While only a corollary of veterinary science,
ﬁsh and game management is assuming a high
degree of professional importance, with the
advent of the federally-stimulated recrea—
tional and conservation programs now before
Congress, or recently enacted.

A professional association concerned with
the matter reports: “Fish and game manage-
ment in recent years has become a highly so-
phisticated, science-based art, requiring high-
ly trained personnel for best results, not un-
like medicine . . . biologically-trained per-
sonnel are needed to monitor these changes,
inventory stocks and harvest . . . know when
and where to stock supplemental animals, or
not to stock them, to assure maximum ﬁshing
and hunting opportunities . . .”

Meat Inspection Transfer
Held "lncongruous"

The American Veterniary Medical Associa-
tion has told the Secretary of Agriculture, Or-
ville Freeman, that it expects “unfortunate
consequences" from his proposed transfer of
the federal meat inspection service from the
Agricultural Research Service to a new agency
set up to replace the Service. Warning that
“the proposal removes the meat inspection
program from its present strong, science-ori-
ented and research environment,” the AVMA
urged Mr. Freeman in a letter to combine
meat and poultry inspection programs.

Promone (medroxyprogesterone acetate) is a derivative of
progesterone having the distinct advantages of exception-
ally high and prolonged progestational activity when ad-
ministered subcutaneously or intramuscularly.

Dosage While 1 cc. administered during anestrus is usually
sufficient for the prevention of estrus in bitches and cats,
the dosage range for bitches is 1 to 5 cc., repeated at six-
month intervals. and for cats 1 to 3 cc., repeated at six—
month intervals.

Side Effects, Precautions, 8f Contraindications ln-
jections of this preparation have been well tolerated over
long periods. There has been little or no pain at the site of
injection. No significant untoward systemic effects have
been reported. It causes no alterations in body weight.
hemograms. blood chemistry. hepatic morphology and func~
tion tests, or renal function tests and urinalyses.

This drug, administered alone or in combination with estro-
gens, should not be employed in animals with abnormal
uterine bleeding until a definite diagnosis has been estab-

 

lished and the possibility of genital malignancy eliminated.
Clinical testing experience indicatesthat 250 mg. of Promone
(medroxyprogesterone acetate) produced instances of mam-
mary swelling and lactation in greyhound bitches; therefore,
this product should not be administered to this breed.

In animals in which perpetual long-term prevention of estrus
is desired, injections should be made at the recommended
intervals. Lapses in administration may result in exhibition
of estrus.

Estrus is usually abbreviated in from one to seven days.
During this time the owner should keep the female confined
until all signs of heat have disappeared because of her re-
ceptiveness to the stud. Treated bitches that are mismated
in this period and conceive may have an extended gestation
due to the prolonged progestational effect. If this occurs.
surgical procedures should be considered for the time that
parturition would normally occur (63 days).

Neighbor- Pleasing Design .

HEN MY DECISION to build a new
hospital was made, I personally felt a
location in a newly-developing commercial area
in our community would offer the most poten-
tial'and promise for the future. Accordingly, I
selected a 7,000 square foot lot on a busy
thoroughfare near a new multi—million dollar
shopping center. It was apparent to me that
this location in Niles, a city of 25,000, located
about 15 miles north of the Chicago Loop,
and completely surrounded by four other rap-
idly growing suburbs, would soon be fully
developed. The fact that no other animal hos—
pital was in the immediate area convinced me
even more of the suitability of this location.
The location we selected, however, was not
zoned for an animal hospital. The property was
purchased from a local realtor at a premium
price with the stipulation that before the sale
would be ﬁnalized, all zoning regulations
would beimet and all permits obtained.
Before receiving clearance to start construc—
tion, the village board and neighbors in the
adjacent area had to be convinced that our
proposed, building would be attractive, com—
pletely sound-proof and absolutely free of any
objectionable odors. Our efforts to convince

them of thismet with great resistance since a
noisy outdoor'kennel, located oneblock from
where we were to build our hospital, had
plagued the neighborhood for several years.
Residents were more interested in closing this
kennel than allowing another potential noise-
maker into the area. After many months of
village board meetings and sessions aimed at
eliminating this interference, permission was
ﬁnally granted for us to go ahead.

Building plans were prepared by an archi-
tect who had visited a number of hospitals in
the Chicago area with me. These visits, I felt,
would acquaint him with such problems as
noise, odor, air circulation, traffic flow, neces-
sary room size, doorways, etc. In my own
mind, however, I had a pretty good idea of
what I wanted since I had been visiting many
other hospitals during the previous three years.

The 3,000 square foot building was to be
positioned on the lot so maximum parking
space could be provided. Since no further
expansion of the building seemed necessary, it
was decided to take full advantage of the
70’ by 100’ lot in our original plans.

Eight client parking spaces were Speciﬁed
for the front of the building, which faces Mil-

NO NOISE. ODORS continued

waukee Avenue, a busy, main thoroughfare.
An additional eight spaces, intended mainly
for hospital employees, were planned for the
rear of the building. No driveway along the
side of the building was necessary since the
rear of the hospital faced a public alley.

With help from a general contractor, who
supervised construction for a net fee, I was
able to do most of the sub-contracting myself.
The architect was also called on to help with
building speciﬁcations.

We decided to use white face brick on the
outside of the building so floodlights could ef-
fectively be used to illuminate the hospital at
night. We felt this would be an important
design feature since we anticipated a great
volume of evening trach from the nearby
shopping center and theater.

To trim the exterior of the building, we
used a redwood canopy and put redwood
planter boxes under the front windows. This
was done to help offset the square, factory-

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

  

like appearance the building might otherwise
give to clients and passers-by. A pierced ma-
sonry screen was put up across part of the
front of the building.

Many interior features incorporated into the
design of my new hospital came about as a
result Of my visits with other veterinarians.
The twin examining rooms, for example, open
off the reception room. The pharmacy-labora-
tory is readily accessible from both examining
rooms as well as from the surgery-X-ray room
which is isolated from the client traffic area.
The pharmacy-lab is also used as. a treatment
area for in-patients.

My private ofﬁce, a small lounge area, me-
chanical equipment room and other non-
professional areas are situated so they are
also isolated from the ﬂow of clients.

Prevents Any Problems

To eliminate noise and odors in the front
section of the hospital, where client trafﬁc is
the heaviest, the wards and runs were com-
pletely enclosed with a soundproof wall. The

non-medical section of the building is heated,
ventilated and air-conditioned by a completely
separate system. This was done to avoid any
possible exposure of hospitalized animals to
infectious out-patients brought into the exam-
ining rooms.

No air can be recirculated in the wards or
runs since it is exhausted to the outside. While
no windows were desired in this area, large
skylights adequately solve the lighting problem.
Air from the examining rooms is also exhausted
to the outside so each one is essentially an isola-
tion area.

Stressed Maintenance

Although we were interested in a functional
and attractive exterior, materials were selected
that would require little or no maintenance.
All building materials used either met or ex-
ceeded building code requirements. For exam-
ple, all outside walls are concrete block.
Glazed tile was applied on the inside and face
brick on the outside. A three—inch hollow core
in between was ﬁlled with Zonalite insulation.
This combination provides for a decibel rating
of over 50, making the building almost com—
pletely soundproof.

The kennel walls, rear hall walls and groom—
ing room walls are concrete block sprayed with
an epoxy paint. The run walls and 6’ high
individual partitioners are glazed tile. Ceil-
ings throughout the building are vinyl faced
24” by 24” acoustical tiles, set into a grid
suspension system. Coved tile bases prevent
an accumulation of dirt in comers.

The hospital contains 51 stainless steel cages
in the two ward rooms. There are also eight
glazed tile indoor runs, each measuring 2’ 10”
wide and 8’ long. A 12” by 4” concrete trench
runs the full length at the rear. Wards A and B
are divided by cages placed back to back, with
sound proofing in between. This arrangement
makes two wards out of the one room as shown
in the ﬂoor plan. The third, or rear ward, ap-

pears on the plan as a separate room. ®

IN COMBINATION pharmacy-laboratory. behind two
examination rooms. all cabinets. shelves and counters
are constructed of formica for ease of maintenance.

     

   

LARGE ROOM. measuring 20' by IT. adequately
serves dual purpose as surgery and X-ray. As in all
rooms in the medical section of hospital. glazed tile
was used on the walls. Floors are conductive vinyl
material so volatile inhalation anesthesia can be used
without possibility of explosion. Door at the right
rear of the room connects with the X-ray dark room.

TWIN EXAMINATION ROOMS. each measuring 8' by
IO'. are convenient to both reception room and the
pharmacy-laboratory. All formica counters and cabi-
nets are mounted on the wall to reduce dirt problem.

 

Usable Floor Space: 3,000 square feet.

Built-in Efficiency at
a Reasonable Price

. ':-~.. _ by GEORGE R. BLIND. DVM
“m a l . Barberton Animal Hospital
Barberton, Ohio

ASTED STEPS and useless space are

just as costly as cramped facilities. My
experiences in a one-room leased building
where I conducted my practice following grad-
uation, convinced me of the importance of
designing a building that incorporated time
and space saving conveniences.

The ultimate in efficiency can be achieved
in a one-man practice when the hospital is de-
signed with' a center hall running parallel to
the front of. the building. I feel this physical
arrangement as advantageous to the DVM for
a number of reasons.

A separate exit can be planned at the end
of the center hall immediately behind the
reception area. In addition to reducing con-
fusion in the reception room, a window in the
wall enables the client to make an appoint-
ment for a subsequent visit, or to make a pay-
ment on his bill. During the nine months this
building has been in operation, a deﬁnite in-
crease in cash payments has been realized,
largely because of this added feature.

Twin examination rooms, connected by a
combination laboratory-pharmacy, is another
advantage possible with a center hall. This not
only saves me time and excess movements,
but it enables me to see more clients in the
same amount of time.

 

24 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

Ward rooms and run areas were designed
at the extreme end of the building, apart
from the reception room, examination rooms
and my private ofﬁce. In addition to reducing
the noise and odor problem, barking dogs do
not interfere with telephone conversations.

While I was primarily interested in making
my new hospital as efﬁcient as possible, I did
not attempt to accomplish this objective by
going all out ﬁnancially. In fact, with the co-
operation of a competent architect, I was able
to keep construction costs to a minimum.

After the working drawings were com-
pleted, three contractors were invited to sub-
mit bids for the project. While all three were
close dollar-wise, the total seemed too high.
Since a complete set of speciﬁcations had been
prepared by the architect, I decided to line
up the sub-contractors by myself. This not
only proved to be a relatively simple matter.
but when all bids were totaled, I had saved
approximately $5000.

Numerous other design features were in-
cluded in the plans for my hospital, all geared
at keeping maintenance costs down. The ﬂat
built-up roof, consisting of ﬁve layers each of
paper and tar, is covered with small pieces of
stone for added durability. This combination
of materials is bonded for 20 years of use by

The building itself is concrete block with

ing was used in all rooms except the mud room,
the X-ray room, ward and run areas.

One other decision made regarding con—
struction of the hospital proved to be a deﬁ-
nite money-saver. By sub-contracting work in
the late Fall months, much Of the actual con-
struction took place during the winter. This
can be an asset to a veterinarian since most
ﬁrms are usually anxious to get contracts dur-
ing this time of the year. As a result, work can
be completed quickly and at a lower cost
than would be charged during peak building
times in the wamier months. Construction be—
gan in November and the hospital was ready
for occupancy by Decoration Day, just six

months later. ' @

CENTER HALL arrangement in Dr. Blind's hospital
not only increases etiiciency but reduces wasted time‘

these facilities to conduct animal research proiects.

 

WARDS and indoor runs were placed as far from

noises would not be heard by clients or when doctor
was using telephone. All I8 cages are stainless steel.

3- to Fit Community Image

 

by JOHN W. MILLER. DVM
Alpine Hospital for Animals
Boulder. Colorado

ANY FACTORS must be considered

when selecting the architectural de-
sign and building materials for a new hos-
pital. While cost and eventual maintenance
are probably the most important, climatic con-
ditions and building styles in the vicinity of
the proposed hospital must also be considered.
Since our community is a year-round haven
for mountain sports enthusiasts, Alpine archi-
tecture is quite common. I felt the exterior

design of my hospital could follow this theme A

quite effectively.

Not to be carried away by this motif, how-
ever, I also wanted my building to appear
neat, clean and trim, be an asset to the com-
munity and a credit to the profession.

During my discussions with the architect,
it was necessary to provide him with addition-
al information regarding features I felt should
be included in my hospital. For example, I
speciﬁed the required cubic footage per caged
animal for the wards, data regarding the ven-
tilating system, speciﬁc room sizes and loca-
tions, the number and sizes of wards, their
location with respect to exercise areas, and
the type of ﬂoor and wall coverings I felt
would be attractive and maintenance—free.

During the planning stages, efforts were
made to eliminate potential problems before
they could happen. At my recommendation,
speciﬁcations for the building stated that all
floor drains and drains in the run. areas had
to be four inches in size and individually
trapped. For easy removal and cleaning, a

grease trap and hair trap had to be included
in the bath tub drain. Facilities for hot water
for sterilization and scrubbing had to be pro-
vided in the run area. For de-icing walks and
driveways, hot water had to be made avail-
able on the outside of the building.

Design and Material Selection

To accentuate the Alpine design, exterior
materials naturally had to be selected on the
basis of appearance. Efforts Were made, how-
ever, to restrict our decisions to materials that
would keep ﬁre insurance rates to a minimum.

When designing the interior, a great deal of
emphasis was placed on trafﬁc flow to keep
efﬁciency at a maximum. This was accom—
plished by keeping client areas apart from
medical work areas.

Initially, the hospital was opened with two
wards, containing a total of 17 cages. One was
an isolation ward with completely separate
heat ducts and with no return air to the fur-
nace. This ward also contains a separate ex-
haust system, a complete drug supply, sink
and isolated run area. The other ward is the
main ward area.

Since completion, a third. ward has been
equipped, giving us a total of 33 cages. A fourth
room, now used for grooming, can be con—
verted, increasing our ward capacity to 48
cages. There are two drying cages in the
grooming area and two emergency cages in
the work room in which all treatments, X-rays,
dental and abscess work are done.

CREEK ALONG north side of hospital is visible from
sidewalk. Twelve foot deep footings were needed to
reach solid bearing in this area. Unforeseen circum-
stances such as this are bound to happen and at
leaSiL IO’O/o extra should be added to building budget.

 

KNOTTY PINE cabinets were installed in examination
room (above). surgery. laboratory and pharmacy to
keep interior appearance consistent with exterior decor.
Terrabond Jrerrazzo flooring. which offers Jrhe advan-
tages of terrazzo, although at a reduced cost, was
used in all hospital rooms except in the exercise areas.

 

FITS IMAGE continued

Walls in the wards, runs, work room, surgery .
exam rooms and halls are ﬁnished with an
epoxy resin. Standard latex paint was used
in other rooms. Pre-ﬁnished acoustical tile.“
was used on ceilings in runs and wards. All.
walls and partitions in the animal areas are
masonry. Walls and partitions in the front por—
tion of the hospital are drywall.

Sound deadening was accomplished by us—
ing concrete block ﬁlled with sand on exterior
walls in the ward and run areas. This has
proved both effective and economical. Steel
doors and jambs were used throughout the"
building, except in the client areas.

To provide maximum comfort for clients.
the reception room was designed to be both
spacious and attractive. With the aid of an
intercom system, the receptionist has full coni—
mand of all hospital facilities and personnel.
She can also maintain personal contact with
clients entering or leaving the hospital. This
system has prevented failures in rotation of Cli—
ents and in charging or collecting for hospital
services rendered.

Medical and surgical areas are separated
from public areas by doors marked “no admit-
tance.” This has proved to be an excellent
idea. If this practice is started when a new
hOSpital is opened, clients will respect such a
sign. It can have an effect on efﬁciency.

Laminated plastic cages were selected on
the basis of low initial cost and ease of cleaning.
They transmit less sound and keep animals
warm. In. addition to the 33 cages now in use.
we have six inside and 2 outside runs. Since
at least 50% of our practice is with cats, the
total amount of exercise area needed is ma—

terially reduced. ®

WHEN DESIGNING
the exterior of his
hospital. Dr. Hana-
walt stressed sim-
plicity. He wanted a
building that would
easily identify itself
to the public without
appearing gaudy.

Functional. but . . .

Client Convenience Comes First

by PAUL L. HANAWALT, DVM
West Side Animal Hospital
Lexington. Kentucky

ODAY, the design of a new veterinary

hospital must include a number of
client conveniences. Ample parking and meth—
ods for eliminating or reducing hospital odors
and noise must be incorporated into plans for
a new building if the veterinarian is at all
concerned with establishing and maintaining
a good client relationship.

Solving the parking problem was of special
importance to me since the lot I purchased
was on a main street with commercial estab-
lishments on either side. To provide an ade-
quate number of parking spaces for clients,
I positioned my building on the site so the
area in front of the building could be paved
for this purpose. I decided against having
spaces along the side of the building so when
it was planted with grass and shrubs, it could
be used as an exercise area by clients.

My plan to eliminate both odors and noise
in the main section of the building has also
proved successful. This problem was solved
by putting a covered breezeway between the
medical portion of the hospital and the kennel
and run area. While some veterinarians express
skepticism for this type of hospital arrange-
ment, I have found I no longer have to
apologize to early morning clients for bad
hospital odors.

30 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

To avoid getting odors back into the main
section of the building through the heating
and ventilating system, cold air returns were
not installed in the kennel area. In addition
to serving as a client convenience, this also
proved satisfactory from an economic stand—
point. The highest gas bill so far, for hot
water and heat, has been $23.12. Our two-
month electric bill, even during the summer
when the hospital is completely air conditioned,
never exceeds $50.00.

In addition to incorporating these client
conveniences into the design of my hospital,
I was concerned with making it both func-
tional and attractive, without appearing gaudy.
The plans I drew up myself incorporated my
ideas on how a hospital can be designed so
that unnecessary steps are avoided and wasted
time is eliminated.

Since the 9,360 square foot lot I purchased
was low, in relation to the street, I took ad-
vantage of this by including a seven-foot high
basement in my plans. I felt this area would
solve any storage problems, house the heating
and air conditioning equipment, water heater,
water softener, bath tub, four extra cages and
a Exit and wood-working shop.

To keep contracting and construction costs
to a minimum, I decided to complete a majOr

portion of the exterior work by myself. While
it did require a lot of time, I managed to level
the lot, dig the trenches, place and pour the
steel footings, handle the carpentry, painting
and decorating alone. All other work was sub-
contracted.

Concrete block was used on all exterior sur-
faces. The front walls were then faced with
brick. On the inside, one inch of styrofoam
was cemented with mortar, and covered with
plaster. All partitions are wood, lath and plas-
ter, with masonite wainscots.

Concrete was used for the ﬂoors in the ken-
nel area. All other ﬂoors are wood with a
coating of vinyl asbestos tile. All materials
were selected on the basis of serviceability,
cost, low maintenance and availability.

Skylights that can be opened and screened
provide adequate light and ventilation in the

kennel areas. The breezeway, which also
covers the rear entrance to the hospital, has
a transparent ﬁberglass roof.

There are a total of 31 cages in the hos-
pital. Five 36—inch cages in the kennel room
are masonry while all others are stainless steel
insulated with poured-in Zonolite.

Ordinary kitchen-type cabinets and counter-
tops have been installed in the examination
room and surgery. The examination and treat-
ment tables are also cabinet-type and each
has adequate storage space on one side. All
table tops and counters are vinyl with formica
facing on the sides.

In the large operating room, the X—ray ma—
chine has been mounted on a vinyl table top.
As an added convenience, two stainless steel
recovery cages, mounted on casters for max-

imum ﬂexibility, are under the table. @

Simplicity—Low Overhead

by WlLLlAM F. STACK. DVM
Fayetteville, New York

EGARDLESS of how much or how little

a veterinarian plans to spend to build a
new hospital, his investment can be a risky
one if an insufﬁcient amount of time and ef-
fort is spent selecting the right location. By
taking advantage of competent individuals and
local civic agencies one can go a long way to-
wards determining the eventual success or
failure of this type of venture.

Before the architect started making plans
for our new hospital, a great deal of time was
devoted to determining the best location for
the structure. Meetings with the local plan-
ning commission were beneﬁcial as they pro-
vided us with projected population trends for
the next twenty years. We also obtained in-
fonnation regarding per capita income in the
general area, the dog census, and data on fu-
ture growth provided by the utility companies
and highway department.

In' addition to pinpointing the location of
other existing veterinary practices in the area,
the architect furnished other preliminary data
to aid me in the ﬁnal decision. Of special
value were aerial maps of the prospective
area, highway locations, population density ﬁg-

32 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

ures, and two or three speciﬁc locations he
thought would be most desirable. These areas
were either in thriving shopping centers or at
intersections of main arteries.

The location we ﬁnally selected was a rel-
atively small lot adjacent to a village parking
lot. In addition to being a promising location
as far as potential clientele was concerned.
the proximity of the village parking lot elimi-
nated the need for devoting more than a min—
imum section of our lot for client parking.

After deciding on the exact location, the
architect began to design the building, taking
into consideration the features I wanted in—
corporated into the plan. He then developed
the required contract documents and super-
vised the construction of the project. A small
number of contractors, selected by the archi-

tect, was invited to submit bids. Although-
they ranged from $28,650 to $44,800, we*
agreed the contractor who submitted the $28,—'

650 bid would still be able to complete the
hospital to our satisfaction.

The 2,650 square foot building was de-'

signed to occupy the entire lot. Eventual ex-
pansion, hoWever, was not overlooked. Ex-

pandable grids, projecting from the corners
of the building, would enable us to add on
rooms as needed. By having these four corners
screened in to form courtyards, the overall ap-
pearance would give the allusion of expansive-
ness. Actually, one corner has already been
enclosed and is used as a storage area, thus
freeing one hospital room for either isolation
or special cases.

The exterior of the building was designed
to be simple in appearance and to resemble
a clinic or hospital, rather than residential
property. This was accomplished by using fir
plywood panels painted white, and clear red-
wood slat screen walls.

To provide for a natural ﬂow of traffic, pro-
visions were made for doors from the recep—
tion room leading to one examination room,
the multi-purpose area for emergency treat-
ment or overﬂow, and to the ward area. Sep-
aration of~public and medical areas is not rig-
id, but adequate. Folding doors between the
examination and treatment rooms can be uti-
lized for this purpose.

The use of multi-purpose rooms, as much as
practical, helps to reduce overhead. The treat-
ment room, between the surgery and exami-
nation room, is a typical example of how this
can be achieved. I feel it is the ﬁnest feature
in the hospital, because in this one area, we

 

   

have incorporated the treatment area, bathing
facilities, the prep room for surgery, the phar-
macy, the scrub sink for surgery, the labora-
tory, the kitchen (stove and refrigerator) and
storage cabinets.

To keep costs down as much as practical,
without sacrificing appearance and mainte-
nance, extra thick asphalt tile was selected
as the floor material, and plaster board for the
walls. There are 17 cages in the ward room
and 6 outdoor runs. Once again, with econ-
omy and durability in mind, the cages were
constructed of plastic poured. over wood
frames. Ward space is confined to accommo—
date medical and surgical patients for the

most part. ®

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 

 

 

 

 

USE OF MULTl-PURPOSE areas help keep over-

head at a minimum. efficiency at a maximum.

Treatment room, for example. contains phar—
macy, laboratory, prep area. scrub sink for sur-
gery. the kitchen and adequate storage space.

Worthington. Ohio

LANNING an attractive, functional and

efﬁcient veterinary clinic cannot be accom-
plished overnight, and not without the assist-
ance of a competent advisor. While we had
visited many hospitals in Ohio and in several
Western states to obtain ideas we wanted to
incorporate into our building, we agreed it was
necessary to hire an architect to put these
ideas into a workable plan. We felt the plan—
ning of our hospital should be turned over to
a professional who would act in our interests,
just as we recommend treatment of animals by
a professional.

Actually, the architect did more than de-
velop our ideas. He assisted in the ﬁnal selec-
tion of the site by checking zoning and utility
availability and by making a preliminary plot
layout to determine space adequacy.

Rather than provide him with all Vital data
regarding our hospital, we conducted three
conferences during which we reviewed our
general operation and daily routine in minute
detail. We felt this would help determine the
relationship of one function to another, to hold
down on the amount of walking during a work—
ing day, as well as provide complete control of
the public and animals. These sessions also
helped to determine the minimum number and
proper size of rooms needed.

Since we were planning to spend approxi-
mately $80,000 for the construction of the
building, we felt the work should be placed
out for bids. The architect supervised the en-
tire construction and administered all pay—

bearing on the actual positioning of the build-

tion to making the building appear as profes-
sional as possible, we were also interested in
attractiveness and minimum maintenance.

Interior Design Features

To provide for a natural ﬂow of clients,
all public areas were conﬁned to one section
of the building. When a client leaves the
waiting room, he can see the doors to all three
exam rooms. When he is ready to leave, he
can see the exit door as he leaves the exam
room. The layout was designed so clients can
move around in the public area without escort
and yet, if an animal escapes, control doors or
gates prevent him from leaving the building.

Since appearance and maintenance were
prime considerations when selecting interior
materials, we decided to use terrazzo on ﬂoors
in all public areas. Floors in other areas Where
constant mopping and washing are carried out
are green, smooth-ﬁnished concrete. Where
constant wetting does not occur, ﬂoors are
vinyl asbestos tile. The ofﬁce is carpeted.

All interior walls are either glazed tile or
glazed tile wainscot with paint-concrete block
above. In some areas, such as the reception
room, stone, brick and paneling were used.

Most rooms have acoustical tile ceilings. In
areas where washing is frequent, special plas-
tic-faced units were used.

To solve the odor problem and to provide
adequate temperature control, there are
three separate air conditioning and heating
zones in the hospital. Odors can be conﬁned
to the area where they originate.

Numerous other design features were incor-
porated into our hospital in an effort to keep
it attractive without sacriﬁcing efﬁciency.

All examination rooms, for example, are the
same size. An X-ray viewer and instrument ;

them in the proper ward.

Exam tables and work counters throughout
the building are wall-mounted and covered
with formica. All cabinets, counter-tops, walls
and doors are scratch-proof.

An oxygen cage has been built into the sur—
gery wall. The adjacent surgery preparation
ward also uses this cage for recovery pur-
poses. Oxygen outlets in these two rooms con- .
nect to tanks outside the building. I

There are 46 cages in the hospital. We de-
cided to install temporary wooden cages built
with a Special plastic lining and expanded
metal doors. We plan to replace them with
permanent built-in cages as soon as we de-
cide just what sizes and features are most
suitable for our speciﬁc needs.

At the present time, there are ﬁve indoor
runs, without windows. There is a high-speed
ventilating system in this room, but no heat.
All floor drains are connected to a special
flushable drain so cleaning is quick and easy.

A crematory connects through one of the
runs. It is actually located outside the building .
and is enclosed by a decorative screen wall.

All wards and runs have a special water
system and hose bibs connected to a 1803
water supply and special dispenser in the base-
ment. An antiseptic-insecticide, deodorant so-
lution can be injected directly into the water .
for cleaning these areas.

With the exception of the ofﬁce, apartment
and waiting room, there are no windows in
the building. We felt this was important for

air conditioning and maintenance purposes. All
corridors and animal wards are lighted by
skydomes during the day.

Limited Space No Handicap

    

by JACK W. WAYE. DVM
Kingsway Animal Hospital
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada

HE LIMITED availability of suitable land
does not necessarily have to be a handicap
to veterinarians planning a new hospital. With
the assistance of a capable architect, an effi-
cient, attractive building can be designed to
fit the location, regardless of its size or shape.
At the time we looked for a lot on which
to construct our new hospital, the east end of
Hamilton seemed to be the only area in the
community that was suitable for a small ani-
mal facility. Keeping this fact in mind, I in-
quired at the Planning Department at City
Hall to determine the zoning requirements
for locating a hospital on either of the two
main thoroughfares in this area. A number of
properties, suitable in size for our proposed
structure, were considered. The lot we ﬁnally
decided to purchase, which was just over 50
feet wide, presented some zoning problems.
Part of the parcel was in a satisfactory zone
while the remainder was in an unsatisfactory
zone. We approached the Committee on Ad-
justments, through our lawyer, asking for re-
lief from the existing zoning. This was neces—
sary so that the building could be positioned
on the lot to our advantage. Token resistance
was encountered from neighbors, but this was
easily solved.

 

42 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

Even after the zoning problems were
straightened out, we were forced to design
the building right to the lot lines on both
sides. Allowances were made for 5,000 square
feet of parking space in the front of the build—
ing, and 58 feet was left for future expansion
in the rear, if needed.

As the building was to be set approximately
100 feet from the main street, the exterior
had to be designed in such a manner as to
draw attention to the front of the building.
This was accomplished by using curtain Wall
construction, incorporating a lot of glass and
colorful porcelain enamel panels. The remain-
der of the outside is cement block construc—
tion, copper flashing and Eternite Facia—Board,
which retains its color for a lifetime. Outward
appearance, with the exception of the front,
was designed so that we would have a func-
tional, almost maintenance-free building.

Suitable for Multiple Practice

When designing the interior, we took into
consideration the fact that we were setting up
for a three-man small animal practice. Facili-
ties would have to accommodate 75 animals.
Adequate allowances were made for expansion
of our professional staif and record-keeping

systems. The ﬂoor plan was designed to p10-
vide for a natural ﬂow Of clients.

Materials used throughout the building
were selected on the basis of attractiveness
and ease of maintenance. The ﬂoors are ter-
razzo. In the public section of the hospital, all
walls to Data height are ﬁnished with a fur-
niture-ﬁnished arborite. In the animal portion,
all walls from the terrazzo base to Dato height
are ﬁnished with glazed cement block, known
in this area as Spectro— glaze. Upper portions
of the walls are plastered and painted. Acous—
tical plaster ceilings are standard throughout
the building. The roof is pre-cast concrete.

There are 74 stainless steel cages in the
ﬁve ward rooms in the hospital. In my opinion,
there is nothing as durable and maintenance—
free as stainless steel cages, and in many
cases, the other materials that might be suit-
able are equally as expensive.

There are a total of ten exercise runs
five are completely inside the building, and
five are outside.

Solves Odor Problems

I feel two outstanding features were includ-
ed in the design of our building. Two high
speed jet fans on the roof, one at each end of
the hall in the animal section of the building,
completely change the air ten times every
half hour. As a result, the majority of animal
odors have been eliminated in both the animal
section and public areas of the building.

A hallway, running the full width of the
building, separates the public area from the
medical area. This feature makes it possible
to keep clients away from surgical areas, the
ward rooms and the exercise runs. Each area

is individually heated and refrigerated. ®

THE VETERINARIAN who is planning a

new hospital must ﬁrst consider the pres-
ent requirements of his practice. He cannot
afford, however, in light of the phenomenal
growth of the profession anticipated in the
years ahead, to overlook his future needs. It
is vitally important, therefore, that hospitals
built today be planned so that facilities can
easily be expanded as needed.

After being in practice for nearly ﬁve years,
I knew what design features I wanted in my
new hospital. I also realized that allowances
had to be made for expansion. Accordingly, I
provided the architect with a rough ﬂoor plan
and other information relative to eliminating
noise, odor and dirt. The plan I submitted in-
corporated design features that were neces-
sary to meet my present requirements and
also those that would fulﬁll my long-range
practice needs.

With the help of a local real estate agent,
a suitable lot was obtained. Since the terrain
was hilly, the building was positioned so that

I FOUR DOGS—
. MOTHERS OF 439

To make sure Purina dog foods continually
measure up to our high nutritional standards,
they are subjected to exacting tests. Some of
these experiments are conducted under con-
ditions to which the average dog would never
be exposed.

For instance, we breed the majority of our
brood bitches as frequently as possible. This
frequent breeding puts maximum stress upon
the dogs (without impairment to their
health). And dogs under stress best reveal
any nutritional deﬁciencies in a dog food.

To date, four English Setter brood bitches
have set an outstanding record of puppy
production. They have whelped 439 puppies
in 48 litters. Of the four, Queen is the indi—
vidual leader with 124 puppies whelped in
14 litters. However, she is followed closely by
Vicky, who has whelped 109 pups in 11 litters.

Average age for the group is 9% years. Of
pups whelped alive, an average 86.7% have
been weaned. All the dogs have produced 10
or more litters.

These brood bitches receive the same treat-
ment as the other dogs. They are housed
under kennel Conditions and are maintained
on regular worming and vaccination sched-
ules. They are watched closely for any ab-
normalities or illness, and complete records
are kept on their general health and condition.

All are fed either Purina Dog Chow, New
Purina Dog Meal or experimental dry rations
and water. Never do they receive supple-
ments of any kind. '

PRESENT. FUTU RE continued

parking area would be on the higher eleva-
tion. The private entrance to the living quar-
ters on the lower level, and the employee park-
ing area, are at the rear of the building.

The exterior of the hospital was designed to
be a credit to the profession and neighbor-
hood. To accomplish this objective, shadow
block and brick seemed most adequate as
the dominant building materials.

Decisions regarding interior layout and de-
sign were based primarily on my previous ex—
perience in practice. Separation of medical and
public areas, which I felt was of prime im-
portance, was accomplished by planning a cor-
ridor between the examination rooms and rest
of the building. This is important not only from
a privacy standpoint, but it helps insure the
safety of clients, especially children.

To maintain complete control over clients,
and to encourage cash payments, trafﬁc ﬂow
was designed so all clients must enter and
leave the hospital through the reception area.
While this arrangement meets with disapproval
in some areas, and knowing there would be
some instances when the reception room would
be both crowded and confused, I still felt this
layout would still be more advantageous for
my speciﬁc uses.

Selection of materials for the interior was
based on appearance, durability and mainte-
nance. All ﬂoors in the hospital are terrazzo
tile with a six inch ceramic base. Exterior walls
are cement block. The interior is drywall. Vise
wall glaze covers the lower four feet of the
walls. All ceilings are painted.

There are two separate heating and air con-
ditioning units in the hospital, one for the pub-
lic area and the other for the remainder of
the building. Since there are no windows, sky-
lights were included in the laboratory, surgery
and ward rooms. To help solve the odor prob—
lem, exhaust fans are installed in the ceilings.

The hospital includes a total of 46 cages.
There are 26 in the main ward, 10 in the in-
fectious ward and 5 in the recovery room.
The remaining 5 cages are in the front corridor
and are used for receiving animals. All are
stainless steel since we were primarily inter-
ested, once again, in maintenance and dur-
ability. There are 6 runs in the main ward and

2 in the infectious ward. ' @

A CIRCULAR building, if properly planned
and designed, can offer the ultimate to
the practitioner primarily interested in conserv-
ing space and eliminating wasted efforts.

Having practiced in this community for
more than twenty years, I was determined to
incorporate a circular flow of traffic into my
new hospital. A young draftsman, who under-
stood and appreciated my views about the
advantages of this type of floor plan, was re-
tained to draw up plans and detailed speciﬁ—
cations for the building. Having closely watched
the area grow in recent years, I had already
purchased the lot I thought offered the most
potential. My prime target was to build my
hospital as close as possible to the local medi-
cal center and doctor’s and dentist’s clinics
without being a nuisance.

In addition to wanting my building to offer
the maximum as far as usable floor space, I
felt adequate allowances should be made for
client parking spaces and eventual expansion
of facilities. Solving the parking area problem
was simple since local building codes required
that the building had to be set back 50 feet
from the street.

Selection of materials for the exterior of
the building, which has a diameter of 56 feet,
was based on physical appearance and dura-
bility. To accomplish these objectives, it was

decided that light stacked concrete blocks
should be used. By speciﬁng white blocks, the
neatness and attractiveness of the building
would be accentuated.

To achieve the desired effect provided by
the circular floor plan, the client entrance was
placed at the center of the building front.

glass chairs in the waiting room were de—
signed by the Holiday Inn for use in their ho—
tels and motels. A decorative effect is provid—
ed by a plastic planter, and walnut and bronze
cut-outs of a dog and cat on the walls.

There is a hall leading from either side of
the reception room that extends completely
around the building. After an incoming client
is greeted by the receptionist, he enters the
door at the left of the room. The ﬁrst door
on the left side is the examination room. The
surgery and bathing and grooming room also
open off this corridor.

The center of the building within the circle
formed by the hall, contains the pharmacy.
X—ray and dark room, the treatment room, the
dispensing room (which is visible through a
window in the reception area) and my office.

Non-public areas are to the right of the
reception area which provides for a natural
segregation of hospital sections. The utility
room, food preparation and food storage room
and isolation ward are in this section.

The general ward room, which contains 29
metal cages, is conveniently located across the
hall from the treatment room. Metal cages
were selected since they are durable, easy to
keep clean and disinfected.

At the rear of the building, there are 14
outside runs. A five-foot overhang provides
partial protection for the animals.

Many other features were included in the
plan for the hospital, all designed to increase
efficiency, reduce confusion, and keep main—
tenance problems to a minimum. Poured insula-
tion, for example, in all external walls, helps
keep heating and cooling costs down. All water
lines are copper and incorporated into the floor.
All wiring is installed in the ceiling, in conduit.
In the examination room, surgery and treat-
ment room, all sinks have step-on valves so
they can be operated without the use of
hands. All floors are asphalt tile.

Total cost for the 2,000 square foot build-
ing, excluding equipment and supplies, was less
than $30,000. By having the draftsman pre-
pare detailed Speciﬁcations for the hostpial, it
was possible to save a considerable amount of
money by contracting the construction work
and interior ﬁnishing on a low—bid basis.

Purpose Building

by J. R. SOMERVILLE, DVM

Akron. Ohio

ARLY LAST year, to take advantage of
the potential offered in a growing Akron
suburb, I decided to build a combination out-
patient clinic and residence. Up to that time,
I had practiced in Canal Fulton, just ten miles
away, in a two-man hospital. The decline of
large animal clients in the area convinced me
that a part-time clinic, just far enough away
from Canal Fulton to serve additional clients,
could be operated successfully and proﬁtably.
The 24,200 square foot lot I selected for
the building was situated on a highly-traveled

.m-q— . “swung «w .

 

 

road. I was certain of the features I wanted
to include in the clinic, so no attempt was
made to hire an architect.

The two-story building was designed to
have the reception room and examination
room on part of the ﬁrst ﬂoor, the cages and
runs in the basement. The remainder of the
ﬁrst ﬂoor and the entire second ﬂoor would
initially serve as living quarters. As the prac-
tice would grow, the entire ﬁrst floor could
easily be converted to include a pharmacy,
surgery and a private ofﬁce.

STAlRS from examination room lead to basement
which is now used as storage area and kennel room.
The l3 cages are a combination of ceramic Jrile with
galvanized steel doors, Three indoor runs face Jrhe
cages. Insulation in Jrhe unfinished portion of the ceil-
ing will help keep noise problem to a minimum.

DUAL PU RPOSE continued

At present, routine surgery and some hospi-
talization cases are handled here. When X-rayS
or other specialized services are required, ani-
mals are taken to the Canal Fulton hospital.

While I agree that living quarters and hos-
pital facilities on the same ﬂoor can present
some problems, much can be said to substan-
tiate this arrangement. Naturally, overhead is
lower. Lay help is no problem, since my wife
handles all calls and appointments when I’m
on duty at the other hOSpital.

The exterior of the building was designed
to resemble a home rather than have a hos-
pital-type appearance. To accomplish this, the
lower portion is cement block painted white.
The upper portion is wood siding. The painted
part may be covered with a brick veneer at a
later date.

Adequate parking facilities are available di—
rectly in front of the building. At present, this
area is covered with limestone which is more
than satisfactory since it keeps clean and at—
tractive.

tion room is at the rear. The right half of
the building is now used for living quarters.
It contains a kitchen and living room. The bed—
rooms are on the second ﬂoor.

Durable. Easy to Clean

Equipment and materials used in the clinic

were selected on the basis of appearance, dura-
bility and ease of maintenance. Armstrong
vinyl asbestos tile was used throughout, since
it is economical, attractive and long-lasting.
The ceilings are Armstrong asbestos ﬁreproof
tile. The walls, in both the reception room and
examination room, are paneled to the wainscot
with Marlite. The upper portion is covered
with a plastic-coated steel tile. While this ma-
terial can be dented and scratched, it cannot
be chipped.
‘ A modiﬁed base from a barber chair, mount-
ed With a stainless steel top, serves as the
examining table. By constructing the table my-
self, I was able to save a considerable amount
of money as compared to the retail cost of a
commercial table.

The cages and enclosed runs are in the
basement, which also houses the heating
equipment. Adequate storage space is also
available. At present, there are 13 cages and
three runs. The cages, which I designed and
built myself, are ceramic tile with galvanized

steel doors. @

‘Warm . . . Informal . . . Domestic

by GEORGE K. MacQUARRlE. DVM
General Veterinary Hospital
Edmonton, Alberta. Canada

N INTENSIVE study of our clientele,

conducted in 1963, was primarily respon-
sible for the decision to relocate our veteri-
nary hospital. The practice, as such, had eX-
isted since 1942, but when We determined
that more than 50% of our clients lived in the
western section of the city, efforts began to
ﬁnd a suitable site for a new building.

In addition to ﬁnding a location in an area
zoned for light industry, we sought a site near
a main trafﬁc artery, close to a major shop-
ping center. Although we served a middle up-
per class residential clientele, we still had to
consider the needs of our large animal clients.

After we decided on our location, we hired
an architect. This was necessary for two rea—
sons. First, city ordinances require that plans
for commercial buildings must be prepared by
either an architect or an engineer. Due to
the proposed size and scope of the project,
an architect’s services seemed quite necessary.

It was also necessary to have competent le-
gal assistance. Our regular legal advisors
proved invaluable with regard to channels of

civic government that were to be pursued in
order to get city approval of the project with-
out undue delay.

In addition to providing the architect with
as much information as possible, we encour—
aged him to visit several other local veteri—
nary hospitals, the Vivarium at the University
of Alberta and local SPCA facilities. From the
start, there was constant consultation be-
tween the architect, Dr. ]ames E. Rattray,
Dr. Ken R. Abbey and myself. All aspects and
requirements for the hospital were thoroughly
discussed right through to the completion of
the project.

Location of the building was determined es-
sentially by the size of the lot and its shape.
The architect, however, governed by building
regulations, prevailing climatic conditions, ac-
cessibility and esthetic factors, decided the
actual position of the building.

square foot building was designed to give a

than a stereotyped, sterile clinical perspective.
Materials and accessories were selected
with appearance as certainly the major con-
sideration. We were, however, also interested
in materials that would prove utilitarian and
compatible to our north temperate climate.
When planning the interior, we tried, as
much as practical, to separate public, profes-
sional and lay employee areas. For example,
radiological, surgical, laboratory, treatment
and consultive areas were designated as pro-
fessional; reception, ward, grooming and food
preparation as employee oriented; waiting and
dispensary areas as public. Distinct sections
for clients with canine, feline and farm ani-
mals provided natural segregation of clients.
When evaluating materials for ﬂoors and
walls, we were interested in hygiene, main-
tenance, durability and appearance. There-
fore, with the exception of the attendants
suite, the large animal dispensary and our pri—
vate ofﬁce, which have vinyl tile ﬂoors and
plaster walls, the ﬂoors are concrete slab ﬁn-
ished with Dexotex on plastic matrix terrazzo.
Cost-wise, terrazzo was considered too expen-
sive for the entire ﬂoor area. The major and
minor surgeries have Dexotex conductive ﬂoors.

All wards, kennels and pre-surgical areas
have Dexotex (over concrete slab) ﬂoors.
These are coved in all areas to insure smooth
integration with the walls which are either
plastic or concrete block ﬁnished with Dexo—
tex to a height of between ﬁve and seven feet.

Our choice of an epoxy resin ﬁnish through-
out the building was governed primarily by
the qualities of the material. It is impervious
to urine, acids, alkalies, etc. It is easy to
clean and is said to be extremely tough and
durable.

There are 84 cages in our hospital, 62 of
which have adjoining outdoor runs. Materials
selected for cage construction, once again,
were concrete block and slab with a Dexotex
ﬁnish. Outside runs are smooth concrete slabs.
Partitions are galvanized steel and the fronts
are constructed with galvanized wire mesh.

vate doctors office and three-room attendants suite.

 

Each run has a walk-in gate. Cutters and
drains, with an adjoining sidewalk, parallel the
length of the outside runs.

We feel a number of outstanding features
and materials were incorporated into several
areas of our building.

All drains, for example, were designed to
accommodate large amounts of hair and de-
bris. Traps are readily accessible and easily
cleaned. Large hot water heaters insure ade-
quate hot water for cleaning purposes. X-Ray
developing tanks have a constant circulating
temperature controlled source of water. Sinks
are “hospital” type as are the taps in. profes-
sional areas of the building. All can be operat-
ed without the use of hands.

Combines Style,

Client-Oriented Features

THE STYLE and design of a veterinary
hospital is often a matter of personal pref—
erence. Naturally, when a building is to be
constructed in or near a business district, it
is usually advisable to conform to the domi-
nant architectural style in the area. In our
case, however, the 23,320 square foot lot we
selected was on a heavily traveled road, apart
from busy shopping centers or commercial are-
as. As a result, I was able to concentrate on
planning a substantial building, one I felt
would be attractive to clients, a credit to the
profession and easy to maintain.

Being located in southern Florida, I felt a
building constructed of materials common to
the area would be more than satisfactory. In
discussions with my architect, I expressed a
desire to have a modern Florida-type struc-
ture, which is usually a low building with a
ﬂoating roof. Small glass windows around the
top of the walls would give the effect of sus-

pended ceilings.
Achieves Desired Effect

To achieve the preferred exterior appear-
ance, it was decided the outside walls should
be stone, known in this area as Florida Native
Coral Rock. Combined with redwood trim, it
would present an unusually attractive effect.
More important, it would be practically main-
tenance-free. Turquoise masonite panels on
the front and sides of the building add even
more to the appearance and contribute to-
wards increased privacy. Solid glass sliding
doors lead from the entrance to the reception
room. Rock gardens, stepping stones and
plants are on each side of the building.

Parking is provided for 20 cars on the side

The interior of the 3,440 square foot hos-
pital was planned and designed to be func-
tional as well as attractive. Two main halls,
leading south from the reception room, subdi—
vide the building into three parts. The section
on the east side of the hospital is the client
area. It contains the two examination rooms
and pharmacy. Storage space and the X—ray
room are immediately behind the reception
room in the center section. The medical sec-

cleaning. Wire cage doors were custom made
by a local fence company.

The DVM/Architect Relationship

Throughout the designing and construction
of the hospital, I kept in constant touch With
the architect. I felt this was vitally important
since he had not, prior to accepting this proj-
ect, planned a veterinary hospital. Although
I had provided him with the basic ﬂoor plan
I thought should be used, close alliance with
the architect was imperative in some areas of
design, especially when determining What fa-
cilities were to be included for proper sanita-
tion, lighting and ventilation.

In Brief: Curatin (doxepin HCl) tablets have a mild tranquilizing activity, not
generally noted at recommended dosage levels. Side effects at recommended
dosage have not been observed. At greatly eievated levels, for prolonged
periods, the following have been observed on occasion: emesis, increased
heart rate, weight gain, sedation and relaxation of the nictitating membrane.

The tablets should be administered intact orally but may be crushed and
administered in the animal's feed. The crushed tablet should be mixed in feed
to insure complete and immediate consumption because of the local anes-
thetic activity of the drug. Additional adjunct therapy may be instituted at the

In Jrhe past three months, as a service to its read-
ers. VETERINARY ECONOMICS has published two
articles abou1L the Animal Care Plan, the new hos-
pitalization program for pets. The article in the

 

December, I964. issue consisted of a question and
answer session with Dr. S. G. Notarius. the origi—
nator of Jthe Plan. Last month. VETEC published two
letters from Dr. Jack O. Knowles. in which he ex-

 

Fair Trial Needed to Prove
Animal Care Plan is Ethical

by S. G. NOTARIUS. DVM
Miami Beach. Florida

HE ANIMAL CARE PLAN is a highly
ethical method for veterinarians to im-
prove service to their clients. Since the start,
we have been keenly aware of the need for
procedures that maintain a high level of ethics
for the Animal Care Plan. Many changes have
been made. Some came about during the 1%
years I used it in my practice, while others
resulted from suggestions. and recommendations
‘ received from DVMs using the Plan. All such
changes were made in a continuing effort to
guarantee its acceptability to the client, the
profession and the individual veterinarian.
Those who have given it a fair trial are en-
thusiastic about the ACP from every stand-
point.

The merits of the Plan can hardly be meas-
ured and judged by a practitioner who has
enrolled only .12 animals. Veterinarians who
have enrolled several hundred animals in the
Plan are in a better position to make a valid
evaluation of the beneﬁts it offers to both
DVMS and clients.

The veterinarian who questions the ethics
of “selling” this fair and equitable veterinary
plan to his clients ought to take a look at
“client services” in general use. Is a plan
that makes more and better medical care avail-

66 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

able to clients, at a reasonable rate, less
ethical than bathing, clipping, boarding or
proﬁtable sales of ﬂea powders, sprays and pet
foods?

In the December issue of VETEC, I ex-
plained how the Animal Care Plan encourages
preventive medicine, while at the same time,
provides ﬁnancial protection to the pet owner
whose animal might suffer a serious injury or
prolonged illness. I suggest that anyone doubt-
ing the ethics of the Plan compare these bene-
ﬁts with those so often used to justify the
sale of commercial animal hospital “services.”

Many ethical veterinarians are doing a ﬁne
job with the Plan. They understand the many
advantages it affords, over and above the ﬁ-
nancial beneﬁts. For example, these veteri-
narians realize that:

o The Animal Care Plan is free enterprise
in action.

0 Free enterprise is better than socialism.

O ACP is not insurance. As a matter of fact,
because it is a private arrangement between
the doctor and the client, it is more equitable
than plans offered by insurance companies.

0 ACP is a positive answer to the trend
toward encroachment into the practice of
veterinary medicine by large institutions.

 




 

 

pressed his personal views about the ethics of the
Plan. At that time, Dr, Nofarius was invited to fell
VETEC readers why he feels the Animal Care Plan
is ethical. Here is his statement.

 

 

 

I realize that it can be difﬁcult for a single
DVM to present the plan to his clients. He
doesn’t want to “sell.” However, this will be
overcome quite easily once enough veteri-
narians have adopted the Plan. We will then
use various media to get our message across

to the public.
Must be Flexible

When a sufficient number of practitioners
use the Plan, we shall, then, and only then,
arrive at a near-perfect Plan. The economics
conditions vary in different parts of the coun—
try, and therefore, the principles of ACP have
to be ﬂexible and readily adaptable to indi-
vidual geographic areas.

The Animal Care Plan can be compared
to a course in Algebra. The philosophy can-
not be digested in an hour or a day. However,
it is worthwhile and important, as well as ap—
plicable to other professions. If human medi-
cine and human hospitals could ad0pt such a
plan, they would not be confronted with
Medicare and socialized medicine.

I suggest that the profession look back at
the past. Consider what has happened to many
secure and complacent small businessmen —
the bootrnaker, the corner grocer, the inde-
pendent pharmacist, the local appliance dealer.
They’ve all been swallowed up in the rising
tide of big business. Unless we put the inter-
ests of our clients above our own, we too will
someday lose our individuality.

The Animal Care Plan puts the veterinary
profession in a position of leadership. It can
be the ﬁrst profession to offer clients a fair and
equitable economic program superior to gov-
ernment operations, insurance company plans,
or institutional practices. It does this Without
tax benefits, government subsidies or charitable

DVM BOOKSHELF

 

 

by JAMES H. ROSENBERGER. DVM

Image-Building Eﬁori- Lacks Current Data

Zoning for Animal Hospitals is a 16-page
pamphlet written with the help of the AVMA
and AAHA. Its stated purpose is . . . “to ac-
quaint public ofﬁcials with the special prob-
lems of animal hospitals and to familiarize
both the ofﬁcials and veterinarian with good
planning and zoning principles.”

The pamphlet, which was prepared by the
American Society of Planning Ofﬁcials, begins
by generalizing about the bad name veteri—
nary hospitals carry in the minds of most pub-
lic ofﬁcials, how they are generally relegated
to heavy industrial districts and that it is be-
coming increasingly difﬁcult to find a good
location for an animal hospital. The report
says “the animal hospital still carries a bad
name that it no longer deserves.”

Following that, there is a syn0psis of the
growth of the profession, numbers of DVMs,
types and styles of practice, and the like.

Taken in a large part from “Planning Your
Animal Hospital,” the next section discusses
the various physical aspects of the prototype
veterinary hospital, as to physical plant, park-
ing, signs, hours and the big three, noise, ref-
use and odor.

The remainder of the pamphlet then de-
velops its philosophy regarding zoning recom-
mendations. Several presently enforced city
ordinances are considered. The point is made
that many municipalities have no provisions
at all for locating animal hospitals. This, of
course, is the ultimate purpose of the pamphlet
—- to guide these zoning boards which are
faced with making decisions on animal hos—
pital zoning applications and must pioneer that
decision.

In its summary, the ASPO organization sug-
gests appropriate locations for animal hospi-
tals from the planning viewpoint as follows:

68 VETERINARY ECONOMICS

integrated community or regional shopping
centers, highway business areas, low-densely
residential-agricultural areas and agricultural
districts; all subject to apprOpriate restrictions.
General industrial areas, older commercial are-
as and downtown districts are occasionally
satisfactory. Animal hospitals should not ordi—
narily be permitted as home occupations in
residential zones. Finally, there is an attached
appendix of the Animal Hospital Standard as
proposed by the AAHA.

By way of comment, there can be some
legitimate criticism by the veterinarian at-
tempting to utilize the pamphlet as part of a
program to “get into” a desirable area. This
seems particularly odd in some respects be-
cause of the supposedly guiding hands of the
AV MA and AAHA in this project. Certainly
we should begin with our best foot forward.
yet pictures on the front cover is the back
of an animal hospital featuring most promi-
nently, outdoor runs! This is exactly the im-
age we are trying to avoid! The rest of the
pamphlet then repeatedly states that modern
methods of noise and odor control make in—
door runs feasible and “have removed the
major objections to locations near other com-
mercial areas.”

Some general statements made, must in my
opinion, be challenged today. The statement
that “combined large and small animal hos—
pital practitioners generally separate large ani-
mal facilities from small animal facilities by
location in a separate building” is probably
the exception and not the rule. The state-
ment that “a few hospitals see patients by ap-
pointment only” is probably behind the times
today and even last year. Many references
cited are from 10 to 15 years old. Granted that
there is not a lot of ofﬁcial book-form writing

ZON ING continued

on this subject, there are certainly more up—
to-date ideas than these which are today gen-
really accepted in animal hospital planning.

Granted also that the AVMA and AAHA
are not writing, but only advising, someone
had to commission the ASPO to undertake
this task. If it wasn’t vested veterinary in—
terest, then by simply withdrawing their sup-
port, our parent organizations could have seri-
ously weakened the “ofﬁciality” of the report.
Certainly this is a step of sorts in the right
direction and there are certain good points
made for the protection of any community
faced with the problem of building permit
requests from a veterinarian. However, today
we could and should stand in better public
light than that cast by this effort. The tragedy
is compounded if it was done in co-authorship
with those who feast at our tables.

Folding Crate Protects Pets

A handy item for kennelling, benching or transporting dogs, cats, and other
small animals is Amon’s Nomad crate. It provides both safety and comfort
and has no loose parts or projections to snag skin or fur. The crate, with
ﬂoor, is accepted by most shipping companies, hotels and motels and will
protect the interior of car or station wagon. Among its many uses are pro-
tecting females in season, as a housebreaking aid, for pet shows and tem-
porary kenneling. It features an escape-proof gate and is made of heavy
gauge steel wire with two inch spacing. Model illustrated is 17” wide by
18" high by 22” long.

Automatic Valve on Catheter
The Foley Balloon Catheter is now available with an automatic valve. N o

needle is required. The standard syringe tip is inserted into the valve and
the sterile water injected. To deﬂate the balloon, the tip of the empty syringe
is inserted into the valve with a slight pressure. This opens the valve and
the balloon deﬂates automatically. The Busch, Inc., catheter is packaged in
the sterile “Stripseal” container and is made of unbreakable plastic. It is
available with See or 30cc balloons in sizes 12 to 30 French. Sterilization is
by electron beam irradiation and checked by bacteriological testing.

Supplement to Improve Skin and Coat

Mirra-Coat is a balanced blend of polyunsaturated fatty acids; vitamins
A, B6 and E plus other essential nutrients used as a skin and coat con-
ditioner. Manufactured by the Borden Company’s Feed Supplements Di-
vision, it has been tested on practically every breed of equine in every
geographical area of the country, with equally good results. Mirra—Coat
is packed in 3-pound canisters to insure freshness. Feeding instructions
are imprinted on the canister which also includes a measuring spoon.

Canine Anticonvulsant in Palatable Tablet
Primidone, an effective canine anticonvulsant, is now available in a palatable

chewable tablet for easier administration. Marketed by “Medi-Pets” of
Primidone by the Veterinary Medical Division of Ayerst Laboratories, the
tablets are specially ﬂavored to disguise the medicinal taste and make them
readily acceptable by the dog without the need and complication of forced
administration. The Primidone is incorporated into the matrix of the tablet
which may be given whole or can be crushed to release the ﬂavoring agent.

Products for Small Pet Birds
A line of products speciﬁcally developed for small pet birds has been an-

nounced by the Veterinary Drug C0. According to the company, it required
ten years of research to satisfactorily adapt the antibiotic concept of disease
prevention and treatment to small birds. Among the products offered the
profession are Birdie Tabs, the original chlortetracycline soluble tablet with
vitamins to be administered in the drinking water; Birdie-Balm, a soothing
neomycin with Vitamins A and D cream for topical use in mite infestations
and feather chewing; and Birdie Vit-E-Mins, liquid dietary supplement
supplying 12 essential nutriments for parakeets and canaries.

ing teat troubles. Dr. N aylor Dilators accomplish
these 2 objectives with this 2-WAY ACTION:

1. MECHANICAL ACTION . . . gently supports
sphincter and teat mucosa —— keeps teat open
and promotes easier, natural milking. Positive
retention in small or large teats.

. MEDICAL ACTION . . . SquathiazoIe released
slowly from within the Dilator provides broad
antimicrobial protection; combats infection;
minimizes ascending inﬂammation and pro-
motes healing.

SUPPORT WITHOUT STRESS . . . Due to
their soft yielding construction, Dr.Naylor Dilators
induce normal relaxation by sustained antiseptic
contact. They act as an internal bandage to the
streak canal.

All hospitals considered for the monthly

an annual I1ospital~of~thc~ycar competition. In

February, 1966, a panel of hospital design

When a single product is consistently called . . . and relied . . . upon
to serve as a therapeutic agent in a variety of conditions, we feel a
descriptive word, such as "versatile” is applicable. FURACIN Solution
is such a product. Its widespread use and acceptance as "therapy of
choice” in the treatment of a variety of conditions . . . ranging from
infected surface wounds to genital tract infections of large female
animals to mastitis in dry cows is FURACIN Solution’s enviable
record for versatility, efﬁcacy and a high order of safety.

Supplied: in Squeejet® squeeze-type dispenser of 30 cc.; pint and gallon bottles.

Available through your professional veterinary distributor.

Warning: Not for use in animals producing milk, since this use will result in contamination of the
milk. Colostrum taken from treated animals after calving must not be used for food.

For long, complicated surgery, or when age,

 

a...

 

obesity or toxic conditions increase surgical risk,
you have always been limited in your choice of an anesthetic.

Until now. Until Metofane (methoxyflurane). This
new inhalation anesthetic is nonexplosive,
exhibits low toxicity, maintains anesthesia with
ease, possesses marked muscle relaxing prop-
erties, demonstrates a remarkable resistance to
overdose and respiratory failure, and possesses
light analgetic properties for several hours post-
operatively. These characteristics make
Metofane the anesthetic of choice for use in
the high risk patient or for the performance of
surgical procedures requiring the ultimate in
patient cooperation. Metofane can be admin-
istered by any method or apparatus which
delivers an adequate vapor concentration—from

a simple nose cone to an elaborate closed circuit
system.

Side effects. Vomiting is infrequent and mild
when it occurs. Metofane will crossthe placental
barrier, and like other general anesthetics, may
cause depression in newborn.

Contraindications. No specific contraindica-
tions are known, but Metofane should be used
cautiously in animals with liver disease and
toxemia.

Furadantin (nitrofurantoin) has been used by physicians in millions of humans since 1953. It is
unsurpassed in its record of clinical effectiveness and safety.

Veterinarians have also used Furadantin and Dantafur (brands of nitrofurantoin) as their drug of
choice to treat a great number of urinary tract infections of small animals. One of the reasons
nitrofurantoin is used first is that many clients will make only one visit when their pet has a urinary
tract infection. The veterinarian wants a drug that is rapid, effective and safe.

Furadantin and Dantafur (brands of nitrofurantoin) are indicated for the treatment of urinary tract
infections because: in 30 minutes there are antibacterial concentrations in the urine. They are
bactericidal against a wide range of gram positive and gram negative organisms. . . including
certain organisms resistant to other antibacterials. Recovery is often complete in 7 to 10 days.

In the presence of marked impairment of renal function, these products should be administered
with the same caution as any other potent antibacterial agent whose excretion may be interfered
with; safe dosage may be less than usually recommended.

Dosage: Dantafur (nitrofurantoin)——Urinary Tract Infection, Acute: For each 7% lbs. body weight administer 1 cc.
perorally every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days. Chronic: For each 7%, lbs. body weight administer 1 cc. perorally every 8 hours for
10 to 14 days, or longer as needed. Furadantin (nitrofurantoin)—Administer 2 mg. per lb. of body weight every 8 hours for
7 to 14 days, depending upon severity of condition.

Continue administration for at least 3 days after urine is sterile.

Supplied: Dantafur (nitrofurantoin)—-—Oral suspension veterinary, each cc. contains 15 mg. nitrofurantoin in special
suspending medium containing 10% alcohol, bottles of 473 cc. and 1250 cc. Furadantin (nitrofurantoin)—50 mg.
scored Ora-Bols®, bottle of 100; 10 mg. and 50 mg. scored tablets, bottles of 100. Available through your professional
veterinary distributor.

ANIMAL HOSPITAL 1:1, 1965

President’s Invitation

Having closely watched the development of the pro-
gram for this, our 32d Annual Convention, and the ar-
rangements for our ﬁrst meeting with an international
ﬂavor, it is my hope that a very large majority of the
membership will be on hand to enjoy and proﬁt from
the extensive material to be presented.

We will be honored by the attendance of veteri—
narians and their families from practically every country
in Europe. Twelve overseas speakers whose names are
familiar and commonly found in veterinary literature,
will be participants on the program, both for the gen-
eral sessions and the seminars. Color television through
the courtesy of Smith Kline & French Laboratories and
its subsidiary, Norden Laboratories, will add greatly to
the quality of the scheduled demonstrations.

 

You will note that the meeting has been extended one full day to accom—
modate the great bulk of material to be presented and to take advantage of the
abilities of so many speakers. The number of seminar subjects has been extended
from 25 to 33, covering practically every aspect of surgery and medicine. Some
popular courses are being repeated, new instruction courses have been added,
and other regular courses have been assigned to reliable speakers. Through the
medium of our seminars, it is possible for a clinician, researcher or teacher to
follow the subjects of his choice through their various aspects.

The Sheraton-Park Hotel is a fabulous facility for handling a meeting such
as ours. Room accommodations should present no problems, the convention
facilities are more than adequate, and perhaps the best arranged for our purpose
that we have ever had. The entire convention, exhibits, meetings, seminars, will
all be in one concentrated area.

Be sure to bring your wife and children if possible. The little ones should
see their nation’s capitol, and with the many tours available they can be busy
all week. For the wives, June Ruebush has arranged a visit to the White House,
the National Gallery of Art, and the Islamic Center one day, and on another,
visits to the embassies with tea and native entertainment at one. The regular
Thursday Luncheon will be a dress up affair long to be remembered.

I hope you can come, and that you will bring with you your associates and
neighboring colleagues. Your personal invitation and encouragement to them can
help make this our greatest convention in 33 years.

JACK R. DINSMOBE
PRESIDENT

Cardiac Glycosides in the Treatment of Congestive
Heart Failure in Dogs

D. K. Detweiler, D.V.M.1
Philadelphia

As early as 1841, Delabere Blaine wrote of favorable effects of digitalis in
certain dogs with ascites and its lack of effect in others. This fairly well describes
results with digitalis therapy since those early days. As recently as twenty years
ago, veterinary textbooks perfunctorily described digitalis therapy, while con—
scientious professors of medicine expressed doubts of its efficiency in congestive
heart failure of animals. For the therapeutic failures frequently recorded, three
major reasons can be cited:

1. Incorrect or incomplete diagnosis
2. Intractable cases
3. Inadequate dosage and lack of persistence in therapy.

This led to the belief that digitalis glycosides were ineffective in dogs and
greater reliance was placed on paracentesis and diuretic therapy in the treat—
ment of congestive heart failure. In the last 15 years, cardiologic criteria and
methodology for the dog have been substantially improved. (1-5) Studies in ex—
perimental laboratories on dogs with either experimental or naturally occurring
congestive heart failure have shown the expected favorable effects of cardiac
glycosides on cardiac output and fluid and electrolyte balance. (6-8) Effective
maintenance of cardiac compensation over periods of many months to three or
four years has been accomplished. Despite this, digitalis therapy frequently fails
to have the hoped for clinical effect under conditions of practice. What accounts
for the considerable variation in clinical results? Two factors are clearly impli—
cated: patient variability, and relative effectiveness of the glycoside employed.

PATIENT VARIABILITY

a. Type and severity of underlying heart disease. The three major causes
of congestive heart failure in dogs are: 1) valvular ﬁbrosis with mitral and/or
tricuspid insufficiency associated with intramural coronary arteriosclerosis and
myocardial ﬁbrosis (chronic myocardial disease), 2) heartworm heart disease
(cor pulmonale); and 3) congenital heart disease. Congestive heart failure in
any of these conditions may respond to digitalization. The relative severity of
myocardial damage and functional cardiac disability are difficult to evaluate
clinically. Factors to consider are: 1) degree of cardiac enlargement, 2) pres-

Veterinary Medicine, Philadelphia.

ence or absence and extent of ascites and edema, 3) presence of absence and
severity of cyanosis, pulmonary rales, dyspnea, and fatigability, 4) degree of
emaciation, 5) presence or absence of atrial ﬁbrillation and other arrhythmias,
6) degree of pulmonary vascular congestion.

Congestive heart failure caused by valvular fibrosis with chronic myocardial
disease or by congenital heart disease is progressive. That caused by heart—
worm infestation may follow a variable course, depending on the fate of adult
worms and resultant changes in pulmonary arterial blood pressure and vascular
disease.

It is frequently difficult to predict the response to digitalization on the basis
of severity of clinical signs. Dogs with massive edema and prostration may
respond surprisingly well, while some animals with apparently moderate conges-
tive heart failure may rapidly worsen. The important thing is to treat all cases
vigorously and persistently with adequate dosage, before deciding that digitali—
zation will be of no avail.

b. Susceptibility to digitalis action. Recently it has been shown that dogs
vary in their relative sensitivity to the production of cardiac arrhythmias by cer-
tain digitalis glycosides. In experiments with normal dogs similar as to weight,
sex and age, it was impossible to select two groups, one of which required twice
as much acetylstrophanthidin, or digitalis, as the other to produce ventricular
tachycardia. (9,10) Estrogens exert a protective action against toxic arrhythmias
produced by digoxin. Entire female dogs and spayed female dogs treated with
estrogen are more resistant to acute digoxin toxicosis than are spayded female
and male dogs. (11,12) Female dogs in estrus developed a resistance which could
not be equaled by estrogenic hormone administration in spayded animals. The
protective action of estrogens and a similar effect of elevated serum cholesterol
has been demonstrated in rabbits. (13)

Thus, it is evident that normal dogs vary in their sensitivity to toxic effects
of certain digitalis glycosides. Whether a similar variation exists in response to
the inotropic effects of digitalis glycosides is not known. However, the inotropic
action is related directly to dosage, and the appearance of toxic arrhythmias
places an upper limit on the amount of digitalis which can be safely administered.
Therefore it is probable that these observed differences can play a role in the
dose—response to digitalization of the hypodynamic myocardium in congestive
heart failure.

RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE GLYCOSIDE EMPLOYED

Qualitatively, the actions of various cardiac glycosides are the same, but there
are differences in absorption, potency, rapidity of onset of action and duration of
effect. These factors are important determinants of clinical effects. Our present in-
formation on them is based largely on laboratory experiments in cats and clini—
cal trials in man, rather than on controlled observations in dogs with congestive
heart failure. Two puriﬁed glycosides widely employed for oral digitalization
in dogs are digitoxin and digoxin. It is a clinical impression that the shorter acting
digoxin often is more effective than digitoxin in dogs with congestive heart

 

 




 

 

TREATMENT OF CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE IN DOGS 31

failure. However, controlled clinical trials are lacking to confirm or refute this
casual clinical observation.

Digitalis leaf combines the effects of several glycosides, most notably digi—
toxin.

Strophanthus seed is still sometimes employed in dogs. The active glycoside
strophanthin fully represents the therapeutic properties of strOphanthus and is
identical in its cardiac effect with ouabain (G—strophanthin). These glycosides
are not useful by the oral route because they are irregularly absorbed and de-
stroyed to a considerable extent in the gastrointestinal tract.

To what extent disparate results in digitalis therapy can be attributed to the
preparation employed is an important question which requires further investi—
gation. Known properties of purified glycosides indicates the relative absorb-
ability and rate and duration of action expected. However, these data have been
worked out on laboratory animals or man. More precise data from trials in dogs
with congestive heart failure are required. For example, it appears that digitoxin
has little action in some dogs in failure and that poor absorption or some
other factor may limit its effectiveness. Digoxin more commonly causes cardiac
arrhythmias, but at the same time appears to be more effective in congestive
heart failure. In so far as these observations are real, can they be attributed to
known properties of the two drugs? This question. is unanswered at present.

DIGITALIS THERAPY

The principle followed in therapy is to give an initial therapeutically effective
amount over a relatively short period of time (digitalization dose), and to con—
tinue with smaller daily doses to maintain this effect (maintenance dose). Vari-
ous schedules for intensive, rapid, or slow digitalization are described in detail
in recent textbooks together with current dosage recommendations for digitalis,
digitoxin, and digoxin and directions for parenteral digitalization with ouabain
and digoxin. (8,14)

Average dose ranges of certain digitalis preparations are shown in Table I:

If the digitalization dose selected is correct, evidence of action (relief of
clinical signs, diuresis, slowing of ventricular rate) should appear by the third
day. If this does not occur, administration of the fractional digitalizing doses
should be continued until a therapeutic effect on toxic signs (vomiting, depres-
sion, cardiac arrhythmias) appear. Then the daily dose is reduced to the main—
tenance level. This in turn may have to be adjusted, depending on clinical
response.

Where there is no urgency, the dog may be more gradually digitalized by
giving f4 of the calculated digitalization dose daily until a therapeutic response
is attained. This may require a week or more. The animal should be examined
every second day for signs of toxic or therapeutic effects.

For further details on the signs of effective digitalization, signs of digitalis

toxicity, parenteral digitalization and other therapeutic measures for congestive
heart failure, see references 8 and 14.

CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE RESISTANT TO THERAPY

Certain dogs with congestive heart failure fail to respond to digitalization
and other therapeutic measures when ﬁrst treated. If the diagnosis of primary
heart disease is correct, they either have severe heart disease which will not
respond to treatment or they are refractory to treatment. In the latter cases re—
sponse to treatment is still possible. It is advisable to hospitalize such patients.
The first question to answer is whether or not digitalization is optimal. Unless
a detectable therapeutic response occurs, the only way to be certain that the
maximum response to the drug has been reached is to induce mild digitalis
toxicosis. In such cases, the short-acting digoxin should be employed, gradually
increasing the dose as tolerated by the patient. Daily electrocardiograms should
be taken to monitor the cardiac action. PR interval prolongation may or may
not occur with therapeutically effective doses. PR interval prolongation, even
beyond normal limits, should not be considered a dangerous effect. Thus, PR
interval prolongation is not dependent on dosage and is not a good criterion of
glycosidal activity. The onset of frequent ventricular premature beats or paroxys-
mal ventricular tachycardia, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia or paroxysmal atrial
tachycardia with block, ventricular parasystole, atrioventricular dissociation, and
ST segment shifts are electrocardiographic changes indicating excessive digitalis
dosage. ST segment deviation is often the earliest sign of toxic action. These
electrocardiographic changes may or may not be associated with depression and
vomiting. The dose levels for therapeutic action and toxic effect may be close to
one another.

While adjusting the digitalis glycoside close, it is best to omit diuretic
therapy, so that any action observed can be attributed to the glycoside. When
the maximally tolerated digoxin dose has been reached, all other therapeutic
measures may be used too; i.e., low sodium diet, diuretics, cage rest, etc. It is
important to continue treatment long enough before deciding the dog is refrac-

tory to therapy. For example, it may require from two to six weeks of treatment
before adequate compensation is achieved.

CONCLUSION

There is need for further investigational work to provide a sounder basis
for digitalis therapy in congestive heart failure. However, incorrect diagnosis and
patient evaluation, inadequate dosage, and lack of persistence in therapy are im-
portant factors in certain therapeutic failures. Each patient must be treated in-
dividually. All the reasons for individual variation in response to digitalization
are not understood, but it is clear that the degree of variation is remarkable.
Therefore, each patient must be approached as an experiment in therapy. The
dose must be carefully adjusted to meet the patient’s need. In dogs resistant to
digitalization, it is necessary to continue administration until mild toxicosis occurs.
Otherwise, one cannot be sure that maximal digitalis effect has been achieved.

Fundamental Hospital Management

Jack R. Dinsmore, D.V.M.1

Glenm’ew, Illinois

This paper has been prepared to provide an insight into the present day
management of hospitals in the ﬁeld of small animal medicine and surgery.

Veterinary students are currently receiving four years of highly scientiﬁc
training to which is added a wealth of clinical experience. Over many years this
course of training has been improved and steps have been taken to keep abreast
of a multitude of medical advancements. The new graduate, who has been trained
in an atmosphere of scientiﬁc excellence and clinical perfection, ﬁnds himself
ready for all phases of practice except the business conduct of an ofﬁce or
hospital.

The clinical years provide valuable experience with a wide range of referred
and exotic cases that are handled by the best methods known to medicine. How-
ever, since the student is not required to justify extensive laboratory costs or
extended hospital care to the owner, he thus tends to get a distorted Viewpoint
of patient and practice management. If the new graduate proceeds directly into
his own hospital practice, he ﬁnds his need for management knowledge is greater
than his need for clinical knowledge. In View of today’s cost of building and
equipping a hospital, a working knowledge of management is necessary to mini-
mize costly errors that will endanger the economic success of the overall in-
vestment.

The new graduate can learn many of the pitfalls of practice management
by associating himself with an existing hospital. However, since there are so
few ground rules, he may also learn some very bad habits that will be difﬁcult
to change at a- later date. There are many older practices that are not well man—
aged from the standpoint of either the patient or the economics of practice.
In some of these practices, drastic measures are necessary, and the best advice
that can be offered is to consult a professional management ﬁrm to study the
problems and make recommendations. In others, in which less drastic changes

are required, hospital inspectors of the American Animal Hospital Association
can and do give helpful counseling to members and nonmembers during routine
visits in all parts of the country.

Veterinary colleges can do little in this area since they are faced with
expanding schedules that leave little room for additional courses, and the sub—
ject has no application to the needs of many individuals in a diversiﬁed student
body, who may have no interest in taking such a course.

PROBLEMS OF PRACTICE

The current popularity of pets, interest in dog, shows, increasing sales of
purebred dogs and cats, and the increased availability of money to care for these
animals are all factors that have intensified the demand for better than average
professional service. In the not too distant past the small animal practitioner who
did no other practice was a rarity; and if he did establish himself in a promising
area, he was as likely as not to be looked down upon by his fellow men. The
passage of time has brought many changes, and the small animal veterinarian is
now a full ﬂedged member of the professional team serving a community. As a
result, pet owners expect more of him, and in fact, base their requirements on
the level of medical care available to them in that particular community.

This establishes the ﬁrst problem of practice, and that is to construct, main-
tain, and operate an animal hospital on the medical-economic level to which the
people in the community are accustomed. Most people will not settle for halfway
measures in the care of their pets any more than they will for themselves. Since
the veterinarian is not an endowed institution but must work at all times within
his potential income, he has to balance his practice potential against the costs
of building, adequate staff, and diagnostic, medical, and surgical services. This
is not an easy balance to achieve, but while it is a major problem, it is being
solved with excellent results every day.

The second problem that comes to mind is the personal relationship be-
tween the veterinarian and the client—owner. Like the professional image of the
medical profession, that of the veterinary profession is constantly subject to
criticism. The improvement of this image is based upon one word: SERVICE.
Providing acceptable service through effective practice management builds the
best public relations program that can exist. Attempts to educate the public
through broad publicity methods—writing, radio, or even television—are excel-
lent, but in actuality are only a small part of the answer. The old axiom that good
public relations begins at your front door is still true.

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO A SUCCESSFUL PRACTICE

Many characteristics of a successful medical practice apply equally to a
veterinary practice. If a practice meets the following criteria, it can be considered
successful: constant attention is given to improving personal and professional
relationship between doctor and client; the clients have a broad understanding of
the best service that the doctor can provide; the doctor is able to practice a high

 

 




 

 

FUNDAMENTAL HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT 37

level of medical care; and the doctor receives a satisfactory return for the invest—
ment of money, time, and skill. In short, the function of a successful practice is to
provide a high level of service in return for adequate compensation. Its accom—
plishment involves a continuous public relations program between the veteri-
narian and individual clients. Once the client is convinced, there is no question of
selling service; it is only a matter of providing it. This same practice management
technique stimulates the veterinarian to attend postgraduate courses, seminars,
or short courses, and to keep abreast of current literature, all of which help him
to develop in his practice the highest quality of medical care that he is capable
of producing.

Any time that the above criteria are not fulﬁlled, the practice is neither
successful nor properly managed, regardless of the income or the number of
clients passing through the door. The veterinarian has little opportunity to learn
this philosophy of practice through formal training and so must acquire it through
training by association or by intuition and experience.

Nourse and Marks (1) list ﬁve areas of practice management that are
directly applicable to the veterinarian: volume of clients, collections, fees, over—
head, opportunity to practice medicine in the fullest sense of the term.

It is easy for the experienced hospital manager to see that all of these are
interrelated and that a severe imbalance among them for any length of time will
threaten the success of the practice.

VOLUME OF CLIENTS

The ideal client—patient volume is one that will maintain balance with the
other factors. One cannot be so naive as to believe that such perfection can be
achieved. Practice volume is subject to a number of variable factors, even after
a suitable period of development. These can be listed as economic fluctuations,
severe weather conditions, changes in staff, new practices in the area, and other
factors that cannot be deﬁned.

A low volume practice does not pose such a problem of management as does
the high volume practice, 2'3. the day’s work load is not difﬁcult and time can
be devoted to each case. Nevertheless, close attention still has to be paid to
overhead and fees so that a reasonable return can be expected. However, the high
volume practice that is built up by various tricks becomes a liability to the owner
and the profession. Some of these so-called practice building techniques are
unlimited ofﬁce hours, low fees to breeders and dog clubs, and unlimited charge
accounts. By continual application of these techniques volume can be developed,
but inevitably imbalances are created. The most important of these is the lowered
level of professional service due to lack of time, and the next is the higher loss
ratio of fees to collections due to carelessness in handling charges.

Another factor governing the type of clients that are normally seen is that
through personal public relations and referrals over a period of years, clients have
been attracted who are seeking a level of service known to be given by a par-
ticular hospital.

COLLECTIONS

How a hospital owner can consider a large accounts receivable ﬁle a criterion
of successful practice is scarcely understandable. Each account lessens in value
every month because of the cost of billing until, on small charges, there is nothing
left as proﬁt. When charges are freely permitted, an active billing program for
all accounts must be followed. The percentage of loss rises in direct proportion
to the length of time it takes to collect a bill. Any bill uncollected for more than
six months is almost sure to be a total loss for various reasons, such as the client
moving away, or losing his job. Although the percentage of loss on accounts in a
hospital practice can be as much as 5 per cent, this is unnecessarily high, the
normal loss ratio should be no more than 1 to 3 per cent.

Many practices of all sizes operate successfully on a cash basis. The success
of this policy depends upon client education and the use of itemized service
slips and judiciously applied pressure. Animal hospital charges are peculiar in
that they represent not only service rendered in the hospital, but professional
service as well. Thus, the veterinarian who fails to collect suffers both increased
hospital costs and personal loss. Operating on a cash basis may solve many of
the problems of collection, although clients in certain areas will not accept it as
well as those in other areas.

FEES

Fees, which include charges for professional service and for hospital service
when this is rendered, are of major importance since they are the sole source of
gross income. However, it is a mistake to overemphasize fees in relationship to
other factors. A proper balance in establishing fees is critical to a successful prac—
tice, but alteration of a fee schedule will not correct imbalances arising from
deﬁciencies in other aspects of practice. Local economics, materials used, and
procedures chosen all enter into a fee schedule, but more important than any
of these is the education of clients concerning value received in justifying charges.

OVERHEAD

The factor of overhead in the operation of an animal hospital becomes more
important all the time. The average hospital manager does not know his daily
cost of operation, 1.6. how much it costs to unlock the front door each morning.
Excessive overhead expenses will cause about as much trouble as all the other
problems combined. The areas that need the closest scrutiny include salaries,
work output, unnecessary jobs, drug buying, and maintenance costs.

For ﬁxed costs, such as rent or mortgage payments, insurance, depreciation,
and taxes, that cannot be altered, there are certain known percentages that can
be used as guides, which will be discussed later.

OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE

The veterinarian should consider the entire ﬁeld of practice as a science,
as an art, and as a business. All of these aspects are important in achieving his

 

 




 

 

FUNDABIENTAL HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT 39

goals. The ideal is to have a full understanding of clients, fees, and overhead
expense, since this gives the veterinarian the opportunity to practice in the man-
ner that gives him the most satisfaction.

CLIENT—PATIEN T MANAGEMENT

As veterinarians, we have two responsibilities: one is to the client or owner,
the other is to the animal or patient. Meeting the responsibilities to both often
taxes our ingenuity and abilities to the maximum. These two problems are never
separated and will be dismissed together in the remainder of this presentation.

Initial oﬁice call

Attempts to question the owner without ﬁrst obtaining the necessary basic
information can result in awkward and often embarrassing situations. This in-
formation should be obtained before taking the client and his pet to the exami—
nation room, so that the veterinarian can put his best foot forward. A few leading
questions at this point will bring out the reason for the office call, and will tenta—
tively indicate the procedures that should be followed next. Try to gather as com-
plete a history as possible in the beginning without rushing headlong into a
physical examination.

Last year, Dr. Lee Phillips’ program as President of the American Animal
Hospital Association had the theme “Let’s Re-examine the Animal.” Programs
on this theme were presented at many regional AAHA meetings throughout the
country and drove home the importance of a complete, or “head to tail”, initial
examination. Depending somewhat on the entering complaint, this is carried out
as a routine step by step procedure that is best worked out by the individual
doctor.

Diagnostic procedures

Any suggestions of laboratory work or other diagnostic aids should be ac-
companied by an explanation as to why. Recommendations made without pre—
senting reasons set the stage for dissatisfaction with the treatment and resistance
to the collection of an adequate fee. This discussion with the owner at this time
gives you the opportunity to gain authorization for laboratory work and thus
prevent misunderstandings at a later date. This is not difficult, since most people
today are accustomed to laboratory work for themselves, and, in a general way,
are aware of its value in differential diagnosis.

Treatment

A rationale of treatment can often be explained as a follow—up to diagnostic
procedures. Presenting the owner with a plan of treatment and the time involved
gives him conﬁdence in the hospital. On the other hand, any attempt to be myste-
rious, vague, or to use terms not easily understood by the owner is to be con-
demned. We should always keep in mind that the owner is here for help for
his pet, and not to be bewildered.

F 60 discussion

With a complete history at hand, and a plan of diagnosis and treatment,
the veterinarian is prepared to give an estimate of anticipated expense. Discus-
sion of fees at this point offers no difﬁculty, and for you to initiate the discussion
provides an opportunity for the owner to register concern if cost is a factor.

Anticipated expenses are best presented by showing the basis for the fees
to be charged. The owner is entitled to know in advance what the extent of his
financial obligations will be, so that shock and indignation cannot be registered
legitimately later. An itemized ﬁgure is best, since the gross amount is not under-
standable and thus is not fair to the client.

The areas of fee presentation, payments, and collections are frequent
trouble spots in any practice. The point to be recognized is that any difficulty in
these areas is a symptom of a breakdown in the client—doctor relationship, and
steps should be taken to correct it.

Practice economics

Since money is important to both the doctor and the client, certain matters
of medical economics must be a part of the client’s education. Talking over spe—
cial problems and explaining medical costs and laboratory charges are factors
of prime importance. Regular clients learn the various costs to be expected and,
providing the fee schedule remains constant, will not question the charges. Dif—
ferences come if the fee schedule is raised or when unusual expenses are in—
curred. Particular attention should be given to new clients, especially those
who have moved from an area where they were possibly accustomed to a lower
fee schedule. At the same time, the doctor has an opportunity to educate the
client concerning the inexactness of medical healing and to remove any false
notions of mechanical exactness in medicine.

Another facet of hospital economics is concerned with what may be called
the humanitarian approach to hospital practice, and involves two main areas for
discussion.

First, wherever a client is truly unable to pay for service that by acceptable
standards will produce good results, it would seem advisable to try to help by
making a reasonable charge and enlisting the owner to assume the burden of
home care. This should not be attempted when the patient is an extreme risk
unless the owner understands the probable outcome.

Secondly, when the results have been less than perfect or the treatment has
failed, the billing or fees should be reviewed. If any misunderstandings have
developed, the problem should be talked over with the client immediately, and
not after a bill has been sent in the mail. For a doctor to adjust his bill to the cir-
cumstances is an admission of humanity and flexibility, not of guilt. Concern for
the client and concern for the patient are of equal importance, and as humani—
tarians we are obligated to use our better judgment at all times. This is the
true basis of good veterinary public relations.

 




 

FUNDAMENTAL HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT 41

Consultants

This subject is important for two reasons.

First, it impossible for a practicing veterinarian to review completely or keep
up with new developments in all disciplines or phases of veterinary medicine. In
every area, regardless of location, there are veterinarians who will train them-
selves in certain specialties of practice, and, by so doing, qualify themselves as
consultants. Whenever a specially qualiﬁed consultant is available, no case should
be allowed to pursue an unfavorable course without help being sought. The
owner should be informed and his permission requested, so that there can be
no misunderstanding where a fee is involved.

Secondly, if you are in a position to act as a consultant, do so willingly, and
with consideration of the professional courtesies required. As a consultant, you
should confer with the referring veterinarian on the history and course of the
disease. All of your recommendations should be made to the veterinarian, and
plan a sensible course with him before transferring any information to the client.
You should also be extremely fair about charges since professional good will and
good-neighbor relations are generally worth more than any fee involved.

Referral cases

The recent development of specialties, such as orthopedic surgery, ophthal—
mology, radiology, surgery, and clinical pathology, has made it possible for the
veterinarian to refer cases that require specialized care. Such specialization has
been made possible by advances in knowledge, by the desire of doctors to give
better service, and by the improved economic role of the owner.

The reluctance of the general practitioner has shown over the years to special
cases has been difﬁcult to explain. In fact, this entire picture has been one of
misunderstanding and negligence on both sides. The veterinarian is often reluc—
tant to send patients to a specialist because of resentment, jealously, the fear that
his own procedures will suffer by comparison, and a feeling that referral of a
patient means the loss of a client.

The veterinarian who, as an expert in certain fields, accepts a referral, must
never be guilty of providing grounds for such accusations, and must see that
reports are returned immediately on the progress of the case.

The reasonable and unreasonable client

As a conclusion to this part, dealing with the client—patient management,
Blum (2), in his book, The Management of the Doctor-Client Relationship, out-
lines the above heading as follows.

The reasonable client constitutes the majority of all contacts, for which we
can all be thankful. This client is not a shopper, doesn’t request the impossible,
and is not a problem on collections. His only demands are the same as upon
any member of society, to conform to acceptable standards of courtesy, humanity

and honesty. The client expects a contractual obligation implicit to the pro-
fession.

l. Conscientious in his work.

2. Charge in accordance with service rendered.

3. Abide by ethical standards of the profession.

4. Maintain and improve skills by keeping abreast of advances in medical
SC1ence.

The unreasonable client, fortunately, is few and far between. The ability to
recognize these clients and to cope with them is a definite art. How best to
manage office calls and hospital work in these instances leaves much to be de-
sired and we all tend to shy away from them. Sometimes, this only tends to
complicate the picture. The following outline shows the principle signs of dis—
satisfaction.

1. Requesting the impossible.
2. Changing doctors because of

a. Failures in technical care.

b. Did not get along with the doctor as a person, beliefs, or appearance.
3. Dissatisfaction regarding fees

a. Office calls too high

b. Drug costs too high

c. Hospitalization length

d. Claims of unauthorized work
Malpractice

Although it is the unreasonable client who is the most apt to institute a mal-
practice suit, there is always a breakdown in the client-doctor relationship. Un—
fortunately, claims are not always warranted and often their sole basis is that
the client refuses to take a realistic look at the limitation of medical science.

HOSPITAL MANGEMENT
Personnel

The veterinarian who manages an animal hospital must do a great deal of
administrative work. The time required is in direct proportion to the size of the
practice, and may advance to a point at which the owner-veterinarian spends
more than one third of his time in hospital management. He must interview, hire,
train, and supervise all personnel, and develop the hospital records in accordance
with the size of the practice. Thus, in addition to the practice of veterinary
medicine, he must be concerned with such other time—consuming matters as the
purchase and maintenance of equipment, the supervision of building repair and
upkeep, and the management of the hospital insurance program.

The problems of administration, including staff personalities and standards
of patient care, are different for each hospital. All of the stay positions require
trained personnel, and so far as nonprofessional help is concerned, the training
is received on the job. The veterinarian is not only the boss, but the teacher,
and how well he teaches determines the efficiency of the hospital. A principle

 




 

FUNDAMENTAL HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT 43

factor in such instruction is in the delegation of authority with sufficient latitude
that the employee can perform his assigned task.

Relation of hospital size to number of employees

No discussion can logically equate this problem to every hospital, but there
are three job classiﬁcations that must be ﬁlled in most hospitals: receptionist,
surgical or laboratory assistants, and ward assistants. Depending on the breadth
of training and the size of the hospital, overlapping of all these categories should
and can occur in the interest of smooth operation when someone is absent. Part
time help is an excellent means for controlling peak periods and keeping eX-
penses at a reasonable level.

A survey by the committee on Economics of the AAHA in 1962 revealed
the following number of non—professional employees in relation to gross hospital
income:

$30-40,000 1—3
$40-60,000 2—4
$60-80,000 4-6
$80,000 up 6—11

Higher standards of animal care require a larger number of employees; thus
it is axiomatic that a high patient census and a low number of employees means
a lower quality of patient care. It has been stated that, on a routine basis, maxi-
mum patient care requires one ward attendant for each 20 animals.

Labor costs—bonuses—percentage of proﬁt

The hiring procedures outlined by Dr. Robert Knowles (3) in their hospital
in Miami, Florida are fair to the employee, and give him a known advancement
rate. Essentially, the new employee is hired on a two-week trial basis at slightly
less than the established base pay, and advanced to the regular pay scale at an
hourly rate upon satisfactory completion of the trial period. This base pay is
increased routinely by 5 per cent increments at siX months, twelve months, eight-
een months, and two years. Further advances are on the merit system.

The use of a time clock or time sheets, with pay based on an hourly rate,
gives control over labor costs and prevents abuse of overtime. You should re-
view and compare these labor sheets in order to recognize increases and other
potential trouble spots and take steps accordingly.

Computation of employee bonuses can vary considerably but, depending
upon funds available for bonuses the calculation can be based on length of
service and individual value to the organization. An average might be from a
half week to two week’s pay, divided into semiannual payments, over and above
the usual normal vacation pay of two weeks after one year of service. Giving
such a second, although smaller, payment during the summer when many of
our hospitals are working at peak capacity should do wonders for morale. A defi-
nite understanding on sick pay and time off without penalty is a necessity and
is up to the employer.

 

 

 




 

 

 

44 DINSMORE

Percentage salary, usually excluding new or short-term employees, are used in
a few practices in which dedicated employees are providing an excellent service.
One criticism of this system is that it place a dollar return above professionalism
and seems to place the clients’ pocketbook ﬁrst.

Hospital expenses

Accurate statistics to substantiate the rising cost of hospital overhead are not
currently available. However, everyone knows that this is happening by reason
of steadily decreasing net proﬁt to owners. We do know that from 1948-1953 hos-
pital costs rose 17.7 per cent, and from 1953—1958 they rose another 18.7 per cent
for a total of 36.4 per cent. Records for individual hospitals since 1958 show
substantially the same trend. This hospital cost spiral can be attributed to sev-
eral areas: labor or help, drugs and supplies, state taxes, and real estate taxes.
The veterinarian must be aware of and control all of these to assure himself of a
net return that will be fair to himself and to his family.

Hospital ownership and management involves a great number of variables.
Also, in more or less speciﬁc categories where accurate ﬁgures are available,
exceptions are the rule. However, reasonable averages may be determined by
considering several classiﬁcations of hospitals in terms of income, number of
employees, and total operational expense. The following ﬁgures have been ob—
tained from four representative hospitals:

One veterinarian $40,000
Two non-professional employees
Wages—nonprofessional 15%
Hospital operation expense 45%
Net to owner 40%
One veterinarian $60,000

One employed veterinarian
Four nonprofessional employees

Hospital operation expense 35%
Wages—nonprofessional 18%
Wages-professional 12%
Net proﬁt to owner 35%
Two veterinarians equal partners $70,000
Four nonprofessional employees
Hospital operation expense 35%
Wages—nonprofessional 20%
Net proﬁt equally divided 45%
One veterinarian $90,000

Two employed veterinarians
Six nonprofessional employees

Hospital operation expense 36%
Wages—nonprofessional 20%
Wages—professional 22%

Net proﬁt to owner 22%

 




 

FUNDAMENTAL HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT 45

Rental or lease payments

The hospital owner should realize that part of his professional net income is from
his real estate investment that he has had to make to produce this income. On a
conservative basis, the return of his real estate investment should be at least

10 per cent. Although this is all a part of his income, he should not confuse it
with his true professional income.

Appointments

For many years the appointment system was set up only as an end result
of too many clients coming in all at one time, surgery schedules becoming over-
loaded, or the hospital area becoming crowded with boarding dogs. In estab-
lishing a new practice, you should take a page from the physicians’ notebook
and schedule clients from the beginning. This may be difﬁcult to do after clients
become set in their ways and accustomed to coming in without appointments.
Clients who seek the kind of service an appointment schedule provides will
come as a process of natural selection if this system is established early in prac-
tice.

The quality of the receptionist is the key to the success of the appointment
system. Office calls, surgery, grooming, and boarding all lend themselves to
scheduling, so that the hospital work load can be controlled. Although the best
advice is to start with this system early in your career, do not hesitate to start an
appointment system if you want a better controlled practice later in life.

Basis for fees

Veterinarians as a group have done reasonably well in keeping pace with the
rising cost of living and doing business. The recent survey conducted by the
AVMA (4) in 1960 is well documented and was an excellent service to the pro:
fession.

The hospital owner has a different problem than the veterinarian who prac-
tices from an office, and has no overhead or employee expenses to pay out of
his gross income. As pointed out earlier, one’s true professional income can be
determined only after a fair rental fee for the use of the hospital property is
subtracted from the gross income. Without this in mind, the small animal prac—
titioner is lulled into a false sense of accomplishment. When the charges for
professional and hospital services are combined into a single fee, as they usually
are, the client sees only the total, and is not aware of the true nature of the
service. This is an awkward situation for the small animal veterinarian who does
not explain this point, and is comparable to the situation of the large animal
veterinarian who combines the charges for a call and drugs without explanation.

In the small animal hospital the situation can be helped by using an item-
ized ofﬁce memorandum, both to justify the charges and to remind one of the
services actually rendered. Such a memorandum, with a copy for the client,
should be recorded for each transaction.

Fees have to be based on services rendered, since these determine the over-
head expenses of the hospital. As Dr. J. H. McCahon stated as a member of the

 

 

 




 

 

 

46 DINSMORE

Hospital Charge Panel at the AAHA meeting in Chicago last year: “We must
know our costs so that we can know what to charge to get our net.” Dr.
McCahon presented some interesting figures, and if these startled you, it might be
well to calculate your own or have your bookkeeper do so. He calculated the
overhead per hour, including lay help, at $12.09, and without lay help, $7.73. He
also calculated the cost of a single day of hospital care at $3.07. His next major
point was that none of these figures include any fee for professional service. It
is sad but true that the veterinarian’s net is so elusive that often he does not know
what it is or where it comes from.

This points up the value of the newer approach, in which fees are set on
an hourly rate basis. Many professional men, including lawyers, engineers, and
architects, charge for their services on an hourly basis. In solving the fee problem,
the veterinarian must evaluate his family needs, his personal desires, and the
way of life he wants within the economic structure of his community. These
conclusions, converted to dollars and cents, represent the professional income
he needs. His gross income requirement is determined by adding the overhead
of the hospital to this figure. Finally, an attempt should be made to convert this
to an hourly rate for cost of operation, and thus provide a ﬁrm basis for deter—
mining fees.

Collections

To assure collection of fees, it is important that they be established on an
equitable basis. They must also be assigned properly for each service and pre—
sented at the time the service is performed. Finally, if the owner establishes an
account, it is essential that the account be paid in a prompt and orderly fashion.
Many doctors seem to have an aversion to setting fees and justifying them to an
owner. Lack of attention to any of these details often is responsible for noncollec—
tion of fees. Although a receptionist may collect the fee, the doctor should make
the initial explanation by means of an itemized charge slip.

The question of charge versus cash hospital policies has many pros and
cons. Charges that are paid within thirty days are undoubtedly sound business
procedure but, unfortunately, many medical bills are not promptly paid. Such
a delay places the doctor in the money-lending business, without receiving a
return through the collection of interest. The unit cost for each statement sent
is known to be 75—80 cents, in addition to a loss of 10 cents on each dollar for
every account over 60 days old, and of 20 on each dollar for every account
over six months old.

Actual year—end losses from bad debts can be from 1 to 3 per cent or more
if poor billing or follow—up measures are allowed. These factors certainly justify
a reconsideration of charge accounts unless a certain loss ratio is computed in
the original charge.

Practices that are operated on a cash basis are singularly free from many
of these problems—no cost of statements, and an extremely low percentage of
loss from bad debts. Many older practices have made the conversion to a cash
basis with a minimum of problems.

Insurance protection

No discussion of practice management would be complete without pointing
out the absolute necessity of insurance protection. There are many aspects that
could be covered but the responsibility here lies in two areas.

1. Monthly disability income insurance should be purchased for at least
partial income in case of severe injury. Their policies are a must for the
professional man.

2. Professional Liability Policy—These have always been a problem for the
veterinarian due to limited experience factors. The AVMA on a group
basis now provides malpractice insurance in varying amounts at a rea—
sonable rate. Even though there are few suits ﬁled each year, one could
be a serious threat to your future.

Surgical Approaches to the Canine Hip
R. Bruce Hohn, D.V.M.1
St. Paul

Injuries to the hip (coxofemoral articulation) and femoral neck of the dog
are commonly seen by the veterinarian. Many problems, such as degenerative
osteo-arthritis, fractures of the femoral head and neck, fractures of the pelvis
through the acetabulum, coxaplana, congenital subluxation, traumatic luxation,
and pelvic fractures with hip luxation often require surgical repair. Installation
of prostheses and removal of the femoral head and neck also necessitate surgical
intervention.

Deﬁnitive anatomic structures may be more readily exposed surgically with
less danger to vital organs and neurovascular tissues if certain roadways or surg—
ical approaches are used. The incision should be long enough not to hinder any
part of the operation. It should follow lines of cleavage and fascial planes, and
when possible, pass between muscles rather than through them. Major nerves
and vessels should be avoided or, if necessarily encountered, identiﬁed, isolated,
and protected.

Although several of the surgical exposures described herein have previously
been reported 2, 3, 6, 10, they will be reviewed for the sake of completeness. Bot—
tarelli, in 1938, (3) described a posterior approach which is somewhat similar to
that described herein. He also outlined an anterodorsal approach, which was later
modiﬁed and described by Archibald and associates (2,7) as the anterior ap-
proach. Brown’s (6) dorsal approach is classic and has been frequently referred
to by various authors. (4, 5, 9, 11-14) Gorman (10) described a dorsal approach
for installation of his prosthesis. Jenny (12) preferred the anterior approach be—
cause he thought it was less traumatic, but he indicated that it offers less exposure
than the Brown approach. Anderson and associates (1) used a modiﬁed dorsal
exposure for femoral neck fractures. The ventral approach to the hip, described
for the ﬁrst time in the present paper, differs from that of Farrell and Sears (8).
It provides a good exposure to the ligament of the femoral head and to the ventral
acetabular margin; it also facilitates surgical reduction of ventromedial luxations
of the hip.

SURGICAL APPROACHES TO THE CANINE HIP 49

If the hip joint and femoral neck are considered to be in the center of a
square box, four basic surgical approaches are obvious: anterior (cranial), dorsal,
posterior (caudal), and ventral—the greater trochanter being lateral and the
acetabulum medial.

ANTERIOR APPROACH

The skin incision (Fig. 1a) differs slightly from that of Archibald and associ-
ates (2) in that it begins at the ventral iliac spine and courses caudally, following
the lateral border of the gluteus medius muscle, curving around the dorsum of the
greater trochanter, extending distally along the femoral shaft, and ending above
the knee. A cranioventral flap of skin and subcutaneous tissue is developed, eX—
posing (Fig. lb) the tensor fasciae latae, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius
muscles. The cleavage line between the tensor fasciae latae and the gluteus
medius muscles is dissected bluntly, the aponeurotic insertion of the tensor with

 

Fig. 1. Anterior approach to the hip.

the biceps and fascia over the vastus lateralis and greater trochanter is transected
and reflected cranially, and the biceps and vastus lateralis muscles are retracted
caudally (Fig. lc). This exposes the rectus femoris muscle. Blunt separation and
retraction of the rectus femoris cranially and of the vastus lateralis caudally will
expose the anterior (cranial) aspect of the hip joint. The small capsularis coxae
muscle crosses the cranial dorsal surface of the joint capsule. The capsule is in—
cised parallel to the acetabular margin. The cranial portions of the femoral artery
and vein and their main branches and tributaries to and from the femoral neck
(the lateral circumflex femoral artery and vein) should be preserved.

DOBSAL APPROACH OF BROWN

The skin incision (Fig. 2a) extends from a point just lateral to the midline
laterally and then ventrally over the greater trochanter and down to the midthigh.
The skin and subcutaneous tissues are reﬂected cranially and caudally, exposing
the greater trochanter and the following muscles: gluteus superficialis and
medius, tensor fasciae latae and biceps femoris (Fig. 2b). The fascia between the
biceps and the gluteus superficialis is divided, as is the aponeurosis between the
tensor fasciae latae and the biceps muscles, (Fig. 2c). The fascial attachments of
the tensor fasciae latae muscle are separated from the gluteus medius and vastus
lateralis muscles and retracted cranially with the biceps femoris being retracted
caudally. The sciatic nerve is identiﬁed caudal to the trochanter and retracted.
The tendon of insertion of the gluteus superficialis muscle is severed near its
attachment on the third trochanter and reﬂected medially. A forceps is passed
deep to the gluteus profundus tendon of insertion on the greater trochanter. The
gluteus profundus and medius tendons are transected close to the greater tro—
chanter, leaving enough of the profundus tendon to resuture, and they are re-
flected medially (Fig. 2c). The joint capsule is incised parallel to the acetabular
margin. In closure, it is best to drill two holes in the greater trochanter and to
pass wire sutures from the tendon of the gluteus medius muscle through the
trochanter.

DOBSAL APPROACH OF GORMAN

The crescent—shaped skin incision (Fig. 3a) begins midway between the
wing and the body of the ilium, extends caudoventrally below the greater tro—
chanter, and then curves dorsally to the ischiatic tuberosity. A dorsal skin and
subcutaneous flap of tissue is developed exposing the underlying musculature as
described in the preceding section on the Brown approach. The biceps femoris
and tensor faciae latae muscles are separated and retracted caudally and crani—
ally, respectively, exposing the greater trochanter and the sciatic nerve. The in—
sertions of the three gluteal muscles on the greater trochanter and the origin of
the vastus lateralis muscle at the lower margin of the greater trochanter are noted.
An osteotome is driven through the epiphyseal line to separate the greater tro-
chanter from the femoral shaft. The greater trochanter with the insertion of the
gluteal tendons is reflected dorsomedially (Fig. 3b), exposing the joint capsule
which is then incised in a cruciate fashion. This approach affords better exposure
of the femoral neck than does the Brown approach, and, in my experience, has

 

 




 

 

SURGICAL APPROACHES TO THE CANINE HIP 51

been more suitable for internal ﬁxation of fractures of the femoral neck. In
closure, the greater trochanter is replaced and secured by three 26-gauge wire
sutures placed through the trochanter and femoral shaft.

POSTERIOR CAUDAL APPROACH

The skin incision, Fig. 4a begins at the caudal end of the sacrum and
courses laterally and ventrally along the cranial border of the biceps femoris mus-
cle, caudal to the greater trochanter, to just above the knee. The skin and subcu-
taneous tissues are reﬂected cranially and caudally to expose the biceps femoris

 

Fig. 2. Dorsal approach to the hip (Brown).

 

 

 




 

52 HOHN

and gluteus superﬁcialis muscles. The aponeurosis of the biceps is separated from
the fascia lata and tensor fasciae latae muscle along the length of the incision.
After separation from the gluteus superﬁcialis, the biceps femoris is retracted
caudally (Fig. 4b) and the gluteus superﬁcialis, cranially to expose the greater
trochanter and the sciatic nerve. The underlying external rotator muscles (obtura—
tor internus and externus, quadratus femoris, and the gemelli) are fully exposed
when the limb is rotated internally (medially). The sciatic nerve is isolated and
retracted caudally. The quadratus femoris muscle inserts on the femur just distal
to the insertion of the obturators and gemelli in the trochanteric fossa of the
femur. The tendons of insertion of the obturator internus, gemelli, and most of
the obturator externus muscles are severed, leaving just enough of the tendons for
approximation and suturing on closure. The rotators are reflected dorsomedially
(Fig. 4c), exposing the joint capsule which is incised parallel to the acetabular
margin. The medial circumﬂex femoral artery, a branch of the deep femoral ar-
tery, supplies the region of the femoral neck, deep to the external rotator muscles.
This vessel should be preserved if possible.

VENTRAL APPROACH

With the dog on his back and the femur at a right angle to the trunk, the
skin incision (Fig. 5a) extends from a point over the midportion of the symphysis
pelvis straight out laterally over the proximal two thirds of the femur. The skin

SURGICAL APPROACHES TO THE CANINE HIP 53

edges with the thin layer of subcutaneous tissue are retracted cranially and
caudally, respectively, exposing the pectineus, adductor, and gracilis muscles

Fig. 5b . The pectineus muscle is separated bluntly from the surrounding tissue
and transected about 1 inch from its origin on the pubis. This will allow full
abduction of the limb. Further dissection will separate the adductor and vastus
medialis muscles. Retraction of the adductor and gracilis muscles caudally and of
the adjacent femoral artery and vein cranially will expose the iliopsoas muscle
with the deep femoral artery and vein on its surface. The branch of the obturator
nerve to the adductor muscle is now exposed, and it readily retracts with that

muscle. The iliopsoas muscle and the deep femoral artery and vein may be re-
ﬂected laterally to expose the joint capsule. The capsule is incised parallel to the
midline and reflected to expose the femoral head, the ligament to the head, and
the transverse acetabular ligament.

SUMMARY

Many disorders of the hip often require surgical repair—such as degenerative
osteoarthritis of the hip, fractures of the femoral head and neck, coxaplana, and
traumatic luxation of the hip. Certain surgical approaches provide for better ex-
posure and minimal danger to Vital structures. In the anterior approach, which
exposes the cranial aspect of the joint, care must be taken to preserve the cranial
portions of the femoral artery and vein and their main branches and tributaries to
and from the femoral neck. In the dorsal approaches of Brown and Gorman, the
sciatic nerve is exposed. Although Gorman’s approach provides better exposure of

SURGICAL APPROACHES TO THE CANINE HIP 55

the femoral neck than does Brown’s, the need to remove the greater trochanter
(with consequent damage to bone) prolongs healing time. In the posterior ap-
proach, care must be taken to preserve the medial circumflex femoral artery as
well as the sciatic nerve. The ventral approach exposes the femoral head, the
ligament to the head, and the transverse acetabular ligament; care must be taken
in this procedure to preserve the deep femoral artery and vein and the obturator
nerve to the adductor muscle.

Clinical Aspects of Canine Diroﬁlariasis (Heartworm)

in Minnesota1

F. W. Gehrman, D.V.M.

Wayzata, Minn.

Canine diroﬁlariasis was formerly found in the southern part of the United
States, but during the past ten years it has been reported in most areas of the
country and several of the Canadian Provinces.

The life cycle of this parasite is dependent on the presence of suitable mos-
quitoes, hence it is more prevalent near or in swampy areas. The author observed
two dogs with infection due to Diroﬁlaria immitis (heartworm) in Hennepin
County, Minnesota, during the summer of 1936. From 1936 through 1956, an aver-
age of one to eight infections per year were seen, usually in a routine necrospy
of accident victims or animals which had died from other causes.

Suddenly, in March of 1956, the infection appeared in epidemic form and
has been endemic in the Minnetonka area and certain other parts of the state
since that date. During 1956 and 1957, the prevalence in the Minnetonka area
was about 30 per cent of all dogs over two years of age. By 1960, the prevalence
had dropped to three to ﬁve percent of dogs which were two or more years of
age, and has remained at this level since that time. We believe that much of this
decline is due to the control of mosquitoes by the Metropolitan Mosquito Control
Commission.

Why the sudden change in the frequency of this disease? It had been present
for a number of years. Did the parasite adapt itself to our environment, or did a
species of mosquito suitable as an intermediate host invade this area? A number
of investigators with intimate knowledge of this disease are trying to answer
these questions.

SIGNS

The dogs with heartworm which we see in our practice are placed in four
general categories according to their history and signs:

Group 1: This group includes dogs in which the microﬁlariae are observed in
the blood but no overt signs are evident. These animals respond very
satisfactorily to treatment and there are complications in less than two
per cent of the animals treated. During the initial outbreak of heart—
worm in the Minnetonka area, most of the dogs entering our clinic
were in this category.

HEABTWORM IN MINNESOTA 57

Group 2: Dogs in this group have microﬁlariae in the blood and exhibit the
characteristic signs of the disease. They have the typical heartworm
cough and may be anemic and unthrifty. Such animals respond to
treatment, with complications in three to ﬁve per cent of the animals
treated.

Group 3: In this group we place those animals in which microﬁlaria can be
found and severe signs of infection, such as coughing, anemia, acites,
and kidney complications (i3. uremia, hemoglobinuria and bilirubin-
uria). This animal tires readily and may have an enlarged, tender
liver. The prognosis of animals in this group should be guarded. They
can be treated, but the degenerative changes that have taken place
should be fully explained to the owner, since after a successful treat-
ment, the cough and some of the other signs may persist for the life
of the dog.

Group 4. In this group, we place those animals that have all or many of the
typical signs of heartworm, but in which there are no microﬁlariae in
the blood. Radiographs show an enlarged heart and there is eosino-
phila. These animals should be diagnosed as being infected with
heartworm. They respond very nicely to treatment. On autopsy, many
of these animals are found to have a large number of adult worms,
both males and pregnant females; however, there seems to be a factor
that destroys the microﬁlaria in the blood of these animals.

DIAGNOSIS

The diagnosis of canine ﬁlam'asz's is made on the following: signs, history,
knowledge of distribution of the disease, radiographs and examination of the
blood for microﬁlariae and eosinophils.

We prefer the saponin-citrate test because it is rapid and the microﬁlariae
remain motile, very convincing to a doubtful client. The modiﬁed Knott’s tech—
nique is superior for differential diagnosis between infections with Diroﬁlaria
and Dipetalonema. With Knott’s technique, 1 ml of fresh blood is added to 10 ml
of two per cent formalin and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for ﬁve minutes. The
supernate ﬂuid is then poured off and the sediment is placed on a slide, stained
with methylene blue and examined. Microﬁlariae of Diroﬁlcm'a immitis are longer

and wider with a straight tail, while Dipetalone‘ma has a tail which resembles
a button hook.

The saponin—citrate method consists of adding 1 ml of blood to 6—8 ml of
saponin citrate and then centrifuging the sample. The sediment is examined di-
rectly on a slide under low magniﬁcation.

Other procedures which aid in the diagnosis of heartworm are radiographing
the heart and pulmonary vessels. In some animals, a greatly enlarged right heart
and pulmonary consolidations are seen. On a differential blood count, a larger
number of eosinophils may be observed.

TREATMENT

During the past ten years we have used a number of different drugs and
methods for both the treatment and prevention of Canine diroﬁlariasis. All have
certain advantages and disadvantages, and it is evident that one must choose the
drug and method to suit the needs of the animal being treated. Heartworms
(Diroﬁlariae immitis) live in the dog in two distinct states, and it is necessary to
consider whether the therapeutic attack will be against the adult worms or the
microfilariae. To our knowledge, no drug is highly effective against both forms.
From a therapeutic standpoint, the adult worms are the more important. When
using any drug, remember that the chemotherapy used must be of the type and
dosage that will destroy the heartworm gradually over a prolonged period of
time. If there is massive destruction of the worms, pulmonary damage may be
extensive, with numerous areas of infarction in the lung which may result in
death.

In 1956, the first year heartworm appeared in epidemic form throughout the
Minnetonka area, Caricide®1 was used with good results. The effectiveness of this
drug was proven at necropsy. However, in the following years, when treatment
with Caricide was given to animals brought into our clinic, we encountered a
marked reaction to the drug which often resulted in sudden death following treat—
ment. We examined these animals and found that there was a migration of adult
heartworms into the lungs, resulting in death or serious complications. This is a
phenomenon that occurs in infections of two years or longer, rather than in dogs
in the ﬁrst year of infection.

After these adverse results with Caricide, we tried various organic antimonial
and arsenical drugs. However, at that time, most of these drugs required 17—24
days of treatment. In quest of a shorter method of treatment, we corresponded
with Major Bailey, a veterinarian with the United States Air Force, stationed in
the Phillipine Islands, and Dr. Kume of the School of Veterinary Medicine, Uni-
versity of Tokyo, Japan. They had done research on heartworm therapy, and
recommended the use of F ilarsen,®2 as both a therapeutic and a prophylactic
agent. Finding it difficult to import Filarsen from Japan, we begin using Ma-
pharsen,®3 a similar organic arsenical which is used in the treatment of syphilis
with equal results. With the passing of time, we have slightly altered Dr. Kume’s
recommendations, and for the last six years our method of treatment and dosage
has been as follows: In animals which appear strong and are under eight years
of age, we administer Mapharsen (1 mg/ 16) by intravenous route once a day for
three days. We do not give over 60 mg to any dog, regardless of weight. Follow-
ing the three days of treatment, keep the dog quiet for ten days. If any complica-
tions develop, we treat them as indicated. The above treatment is repeated for
two days in approximately six weeks following the primary treatment.

In old or weak dogs with pronounced signs, the animal is fed for a week with
a high protein diet, treated with digitalis, and given other supportive treatment.

HEABTWORM IN MINNESOTA 59

Following this, the dog is treated intravenously with Mapharsen (I mg/I6) once
a month for ﬁve consecutive months. The owner must be instructed to keep the
dog quiet for several days following each treatment.

After the adult worms have been destroyed, the microfilariae in the blood
stream may be removed with Dizan®4 or Caricide, however, without treatment
the microﬁlaria in the blood stream usually disappear in from 8 to 18 months fol-
lowing removal of the adult worms.

Some people are interested in preventing the occurence of heartworm in
their dogs. Since 1958, as a prophylactic treatment, we have been recommending
a two day treatment with the above dose of Mapharsen during the month of
January. This kills the immature worms which were acquired during the previous
summer. These parasites are still small but are in the heart at that time. We have
used this treatment on several hundred dogs, and to our knowledge have not had
a clinical infection in this group, nor have we found worms when performing an
autopsy on any dog in which this treatment was repeated each year.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

1. Infection with Diroﬁlam’a immitis responds favorably to treatment with
various arsenical agents.

2. It responds favorably to a preventive program consisting of treatment
for two days with Mapharsen during the month of January.

3. Absence of microfilaria in peripheral blood does not always mean that
a dog is free from adult heartworms.

4. It is possible to mistake the microﬁlariae of Dipetalonema with those of
Diroﬁlam’a immitis.

5. Use of arsenical or antimonial compounds is effective. Learn the dosage,
the side effects and idiosyncrasies of one drug for the microfilariae and adult
parasites. This is as important as the choice of drug to be used.

6. In our practice, Mapharsen is the drug used for adult worms, due to the
fact that we have fewer pulmonary complications following its use.

7. Dogs infected with heartworms during the summer months will not have
microﬁlariae in the blood until the following March, since it takes from six to
eight months for the infective larvae to develop into an adult worm.

8. Be very careful not to inject Mapharsen perivascularly during treatment,
as swelling and sloughing of tissue will result.

9. In all infections which are two or more years in duration, destroy the
adult worms before treating for microﬁlariae for complications may result from
the migration of the live adult worms from the right side of the heart to the
pulmonary arteries.

CASE PRESENTATION
Hydrothorax in a Dog

Department of Veterinary Clinics
The School of Veterinary Science and Medicine
Purdue University

Lafayette, Indiana

HISTORY: (A. Lavignette)

A 4—year—old 15 lb male Dachshund was referred to the Small Animal Clinic
on October 29, 1964, with a history of persistent dyspnea due to hydrothorax.
This condition had existed for about three months, during which time a veterinary
practitioner had repeatedly aspirated fluid from the chest to relieve the patient.
A deﬁnite cause could not be established at that time.

According to the owner, the problem had started early in June when it was
noticed that the dog seemed to be breathing with difficulty, was less playful than
usual, and had developed a soft cough. There was no history of a traumatic in-
cident.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: (I. C. Blakemore)

On admission the dog was alert, but quiet and inactive. While abnormal
leanness was evident, with apparent loss of subcutaneous fat and generalized
muscular wasting, the haircoat was complete and glossy. A somewhat “barrel—
chested” appearance with a wide foreleg stance was accentuated by outward
position of the elbows. Open-mouth breathing was persistent. Respiration was
rapid, and abdominal in character. Dyspnea did not appear to be limited to
either inspiration or expiration, but was consistent throughout the respiratory
cycle. A pronounced apex beat of the heart could be seen on the lower right
thoracic wall.

The temperature was 101.80 F, pulse 120 beats per minute, and respiratory
rate 30 per minute. The skin was soft and pliable indicating a good state of
hydration.

On ausculation the respiratory sounds were louder than normal in the dorsal
third of the right thorax, and were not heard over the left side; heart sounds on
the right side were unusually loud, but not otherwise abnormal. The heart could
not be heard on the left side. On thoracic percussion the sounds were flat and
toneless on the left, no fluid line could be determined and the sounds did not

change as the animal’s position was shifted. Percussion of the right side was in-
conclusive. The dog resisted placement in recumbent positions, and in such posi-
tions the dyspnea became pronounced.

Thoracentesis was performed on the left side. Large volumes of ﬂuid were
removed easily from both dorsal and ventral areas of the left thoracic cavity.
Respiration was markedly improved following the withdrawal of ﬂuid.

The ﬂuid was odorless, opaque, ﬂowed freely, and resembled blood—tinged
milk in general appearance. This ﬂuid was identified as chyle by ether extraction.

No growth occurred on bacterial culture media. Repeated hemograms and
urinalyses revealed no abnormal findin gs.

 

ROENTGENOGRAPHIC FINDINGS: (R. E. Lewis) i

Standing lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs were taken of the thorax.
There was evidence of ﬂuid accumulation within the pleural cavity, predomi—
nantly on the left side. The left lung was collapsed by the ﬂuid and was displaced
from the thoracic wall. The heart shadow was displaced to the right and partially
obscured by the ﬂuid. The trachea was displaced to the right.

DIAGNOSIS: CHYLOTHOBAX

DISCUSSION: (G. E. Bisgard)

The term chylothorax refers to an accumulation of chyle within the pleural
space due to rupture of the thoracic lymphatic duct. The volume of fluid increases
slowly, causing partial collapse and possible atelectasis of the lungs with gradual

 




 

64 CASE PRESENTATION

onset of clinical signs of hydrothorax. Severe respiratory distress and cyanosis
occur in the terminal stages. Pleuritis may accompany chylothorax with ﬁbrin
deposition on the visceral pleura preventing complete ﬁlling of the lungs. Severely
atelectatic lobes may fail to ﬁll at all.

The thoracic duct is the cranial continuation of the cisterna chyli and is the
main channel for return of lymph from the body. The thoracic duct begins
between the crura of the diaphragm. It runs cranially along the right dorsal
border of the aorta between the aorta and the azygos vein. At the sixth thoracic
vertebra the duct climbs slightly dorsally and to the left of the azygos vein, then
it obliquely crosses the ventral surface of the ﬁfth thoracic vertebra. From this
point the duct enters the precardial mediastinum and angles cranioventrally to
empty into the venous system at the junction of the left external jugular vein and
the precava.

 

Fig. 4. Appearance of a sample of ﬂuid removed.

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

CASE PRESENTATION 65

The duct is rather flat and its wall is thin. There may be bifurcations with
anastomoses along the course of the duct, particularly in its cranial segment. Be—
cause of the difﬁculty in ﬁnding all branches at surgery, ligation is best carried
out as far caudad in the thorax as possible to prevent regurgitation through the
cranial segment of a ruptured branch.

Surgical exposure of the duct may be complicated in the obese animal and
in those that have concurrent pleuritis.

The duct is better visualized if the dog has been fed a small fatty meal
shortly before surgery. The large amount of chyle produced delineates the duct
as a distinct white structure.

TREATMENT: (I. R. Annis)

When the diagnosis of chylothorax was conﬁrmed, surgery was decided upon,
and the animal was anesthetized with Surital Sodium (Parke—Davis), intubated,
and the catheter connected to a F orreger copper kettle vaporizer containing
methoxyflurane in a closed system. The right thoracic area was prepared for
surgery and a thoracotomy was performed, entering the thorax through the
ninth intercostal space. The ribs were retracted and the small quantity of chyle

present in the thorax was aspirated. The lungs were allowed to collapse partially,
allowing access to the area. Because of its small size and collapsed condition,
the duct was difﬁcult to identify, however, it was located and securely ligated
I with 000 catgut near its emergence through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm.
The exact point of rupture could not be determined, and it was assumed that the

rupture had occurred on the left side in the precardial region. (Regardless of the
point of rupture, surgery is always performed on the right side and the duct
ligated at the point of emergence through the diaphragm.) The lungs were in-
ﬂated and the thorax was closed by placing three sutures of 0 catgut around the
ribs. The fascia and muscle layers were closed with interrupted sutures of 00
catgut and the skin incision was closed with interrupted sutures of 00 monoﬁla—
ment nylon. Recovery from the anesthetic and surgery were without untoward
incident and the animal was discharged on the seventh postopertaive day. To
date there has been no recurrence» of the condition.

Bird Clinic

T. J. Lafeber, D.V.M.1
Niles, Illinois

“Where good veterinary service is available, there will be clients to take
advantage of it.” Nowhere is this statement more true than in caged bird medi—
cine. This field, now in its infancy, already has people becoming more dependent
on professional advice. It seems reasonable to believe that in ten years every
small animal hospital will be devoting some of its facilities to birds and exotic

pets.

Whether the ﬁgure of 20 million pet birds is accurate, I’m not sure, but
the number of birds in homes is astonishing. These animals have medical prob—
lems just as any other living thing, and thus require veterinary care. It is our
duty and obligation to arm ourselves with the knowledge to help where it is
needed.

Bird owners are not looking for charity, and are willing to pay the cost
of veterinary service. However, these fees must be in line with the ability of
the doctor and the quality of service rendered. In our practice we charge the
same as if it were any other animal.

Before a client is willing to spend money on his bird he should be aware
of the life expectancy of his pet and of the fact that with reasonable care longevity
is ascertainable. If the owner realizes his pet bird can live to be 10 to 15 years
old, then he is more apt to be willing to spend the money necessary to get it
over a temporary illness. We know that this life span is possible, and it is a
matter now of client education.

The time to introduce yourself to caged bird medicine is now. It is easy
to begin with this new ﬁeld in its infancy and to grow with it, adding to your
knowledge by clinical experience and by reading published information. Ad—
vancements are being made daily, and the results show in the increased per-
centage of cures. Progress is being made in nutrition, medicine, surgery, radiology
and diagnostics. This will continue because of the demand for quality bird medi—
cine made on us by our clients.

BIRD CLINIC—THE BUDGEBIGAR 69

THE BUDGERIGAR

The budgerigar in this country is most commonly called a parakeet, but
may be known by a variety of names—Undulated Grass Parakeet, Zebra Parakeet,
Zebra Grass Parakeet, Shell Parrot, Scallop Parrot, Warbling Grass Parakeet, Un-
dulated Parrot and Canary Parrot. The title Parakeet is really a name and has
many species included in it. For our purpose the term is too inclusive, and there-
fore I will limit the discussion, unless otherwise indicated, to the species (Melop-
sittacus) Budgerigar. The Budgerigar belong to the order Psittaciformes and the
parrot family (Psittacidae) which contains 315 species. Some other members of
the parrot family are the Macaws, Parrots, Cockatoos, Love Birds, Parrattet, Kea,
Lory, Conure and Cockateal.

BIRD CLINIC—THE BUDGERIGAR 71

STRUCTURE OF THE FEATHERS OF THE BUDGERIGAR

Feathers are the major characteristic of a bird and are what distinguishes it
from any other animal. “If it hasn’t got feathers, it’s not a bird.”

The ancestory of a bird is deﬁnitely from reptiles, and the feathers have
probably evolved from reptilian scales. The feather is a highly complex structure,
the most intricate epidermal growth of all animals. A typical feather (Fig. l)
is made up of a central shaft and the flat wide vane branching off it. The shaft
is divided into two parts. The calamus is the round, hollow, proximal portion
with an opening at the end termed the inferior umbilicus. This is the opening
through which the papilla nourishes the growing feather and from which it
develops. The opening of the calamus at about the beginning of the vane is the
superior umbilicus. It is here that a small tuft of feathers, or aftershaft, may
arise.

The distal portion of the shaft is called the rachis. It is rectangular in cross-
section and has a groove running along the ventral side. This groove is usually

quite pronounced at the superior umbilicus and becomes obliterated toward the
tip of the feather. Branches or barbs come off the rachis at an angle toward the
tip.

The barbs have barbules bunching off on both sides at an angle toward the
tip of the barb. The barbules on the adjacent barbs overlap each other and are
held together with three hooks which are attached to the barbule. These hooks
are what hold the vane ﬁrm and make it a continuous elastic surface, which
makes it capable of offering the necessary resistance to air during ﬂight.

Figure 2 shows an enlargement of a typical contour feather with the barbs
separated. A magnification of the section indicated shows the barbules properly
united. In the center they are divided to show the hooks on the barbules. You will
notice that the hooks are only on the barbules pointing toward the base of the
feather. Each barbule has three hooks. The schemetic drawing shows the hook
more plainly (Fig. 4). One author compared the action of the hooks to that of
a zipper. By preening, the bird is able to “zip” the feather back into proper
alignment if it should become split.

The basal portion of the vanes of many feathers is downy in character.

Editorial

ANIMAL HOSPITAL
WHAT

ANIMAL HOSPITAL is the ofﬁcial publication of the American Animal
Hospital Association. It is to be published quarterly for the present; more frequent
publications will be made if such a change would appear to be in the interest
of veterinarians in a small animal practice, and if adequate material for pub—
lication becomes available. ANIMAL HOSPITAL is to be published on high
quality enamel paper which will assure excellent reproduction of radiographs,
charts, graphs, etc. The type and style have been selected for ease of read-
ability.

WHY

For several years the ofﬁcers of the American Animal Hospital Association
have become increasingly aware of the need of a publication for the specific
professional, scientiﬁc, academic and administrative needs of veterinarians en-
gaged in small animal practice. The needs of veterinarians engaged in this seg-
ment of practice are, for the most part, different from those of our profession in
other types of practice; research, regulatory work, commercial work, etc. The
need for publications in specialized human medical sciences has been recog—
nized and, as a result, there are publications in most medical specialties and in
some instances in sub-specialties. The need for a publication in a specialized ﬁeld
parallels the degree of specialization of the intended readers. At the present time,
veterinarians engaged in small animal practice have few professional interests
other than the proper care of animals which are primarily pets or companions.
In this type of practice there are special problems in hospital management, per—
sonnel management, public relations, as well as actual professional care and nurs-
ing of patients. A publication that will meet the needs of this group of veteri-
narians must be unique. As ever greater amounts of specialized information be-
comes available, the availability of a medium for the publication of this informa—
tion becomes more essential.

HOW
ANIMAL HOSPITAL plans to offer a wide coverage of information of in—

terest to veterinarians in small animal practice. Each issue will contain an edi-
torial which will be designed to provoke thought on problems with which mem—
bers of our segment of the professions are confronted. Letters to the editor will
be published for those reading ANIMAL HOSPITAL who wish to commend or
condemn the policies of this publication, current philosophies within our profes-
sion or the actions of certain members of our society within or outside of the
profession.

76 EDITORIAL

A rather sizeable section of ANIMAL HOSPITAL will be devoted to ofﬁ-
cial American Animal Hospital Association information. This section will replace
the regular quarterly bulletin from the ofﬁce of the executive secretary of the
American Animal Hospital Association.

The editors of ANIMAL HOSPITAL plan to publish a number of major
papers in each issue which will be of clinical interest and application. A clinical
pathological conference is to be printed in each issue. One section of ANIMAL
HOSPITAL is to be devoted to the care of birds. In addition to the above,
ANIMAL HOSPITAL will publish information of new products and new equip-
ment, book reviews, case reports, diagnostic techniques, research reports, ab-
stracts, economics, hospital plans and hospital management.

WHO

The editors of ANIMAL HOSPITAL are especially anxious to publish arti—
cles of interest from writers both in and out of the veterinary profession who
have information that would be of value to veterinarians engaged in small ani-
mal practice. The availability of factual information for publication is one of
the most important factors in the success of ANIMAL HOSPITAL. Without the
proper display of willingness to write, both on the part of members of our pro-
fession and those closely allied with our profession, ANIMAL HOSPITAL can-
not succeed. With proper interest and effort, conversely, each of us may expect
mutual beneﬁt.

With this issue of ANIMAL HOSPITAL, the American Animal Hospital
Association realizes an ambition long considered to be a responsibility to it’s
members and an appropriate addition to veterinary literature for all small animal
practitioners. ANIMAL HOSPITAL is the official journal of the Association.

Letter from AVMA President

This is to express our best wishes for success in AAHA’S newest endeavor—the establish-
ment of your own association journal. That the Journal of the AAHA will provide your mem-
bers with interesting technical articles and informative accounts of AAHA activities is a
foregone conclusion. But to produce a product that will create a favorable image of veterinary
medicine at home and abroad, among veterinarians as well as other biological scientists, is a
challenge worthy of your best efforts and talents.

We take pride in pointing out that your members are also AVMA members, and it is our
earnest expectation that your new publication will be an effective force in furthering the overall
objectives of both organizations.

Sincerely,

M. R. CLARKSON

Dr. E. E. Ruebush has broached a
Presidential Theme for the coming year

A The folder distributed here at the
Convention goes into six areas of practice
broadly. The coming year will see the
AAHA bringing out many fine points in
these areas. ‘

But the motto itself deserves much
attention. ,

In a dozen words, it sums up the
balance that must exist between dedication
to clientele and financial return to best
achieve those aims on which the AAHA is
based.

Overemphasis in either direction can
lead to a lowering of practice standards.

Behind T lee TV Scene

We Spent some time watching the Norden
Laboratories (SKF) Medical Television Unit
operate, and were impressed by this unique
Unit.

Those of us in the auditorium saw and
heard only the end result - an amazing true-
color visualization and enlargement of every
detail of the surgical demonstrations. But
in the depths of the Hotel, through the
kitchen, down the stairs, through a dusty
storeroom and past a frail curtain with a
weak "Keep Out" sign pinned to it, were the
men and equipment that performed the miracle.

A huge bank of controls, four technicians,
four monitors, a mirror, a huge TV camera
that unscrambled the mirror image so that it
came out normal on our screen, a video tape
machine, plus all the equipment and personnel
needed to perform and aid and anesthetize
and just look on - all this could have been
very conducive to confusion, but this brew
was ready on time every time, and the delays,
if any, were caused by "live" performers ‘
upstairs.

There were special glare—proof instru-
ments in use by the surgeons, and much of
what went.on out of range of the camera was
[almost as interesting as what did go through
its electronic systems.

we all heard the comments of Drs.
Archibald and.Medway that are sure to make
them much in demand on the closed-circuit
TV showings.

Dr. Crago was given so many credits that
he had to join the AGVA television union.

Dr. Knowles did NOT tsp his toes while
waiting for the iliac artery to stop Spurting.
Somebody complaining about "How come
Dr. Knowles got to bring his.nurse while the
rest of us had to bring our wives?" (Ed. note:

Mrs. Knowles is indeed present.)

The Nutritional Requirements of Cats

STANLEY N. GERSHOFF. Ph.D.

Boston, Massachusetts

ALTHOUGH a number of good commercial
eat foods are marketed, there are so many
which are inadequate that frequently small
animal practitioners discourage the use of
them. Lacking knowledge of speciﬁc nutri-
tive requirements of cats, many veterinar-
ians wisely recommend: the use of a variety
of foods including milk, eggs, meat, liver,
and vegetables.

A mixture of foods such as these un-
doubtedly provides cats with the nutrients
they require for health, growth, reproduc-
tion, and lactation. Nevertheless, this type
of advice is not satisfactory to the average
cat owner because it is too ambiguous, and
the foods recommended are expensive and
require special preparation.

A number of studies in recent years have
added to our still inadequate knowledge of
cat nutrition. This paper is an attempt to
brieﬂy summarize these studies in the hope
that the information presented will be of
value to small animal practitioners.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

Calories—As is the case with other
species, the cat’s energy requirements per
unit of body weight decrease with age and
increase with exercise. Weanling cats re-
quire approximately 250 calories per day
per kilogram of body weight.16 The rate de—
creases, to about 150 calories in cats several
months old and 60 calories in inactive adult
cats.2,15,16

Protein, Fat, and Carbohydrate—Cats
appear to do best on high-protein, high—fat
diets. Cat nutritionists frequently use puri-
ﬁed diets containing 30 to 40 per cent
protein and 25 to 30 per cent fat. The opti-
mum fat level in cat diets has not been
determined.

Our experience indicates that high—fat
puriﬁed diets are more palatable than low—
fat ones. There may also be metabolic fac—
tors involved in the cat’s preference for

high—fat diets. We have observed a rela-
tionship between the amount of dietary fat
and absorption of vitamin A by cats.10
This suggests that many low-fat commer-
cial cat foods may supply inadequate vita-
min A. Although we have obtained con-
sistently better results with puriﬁed diets
containing 26 per cent fat than 5 per cent
fat, an intermediate level might be more
desirable.

Unlike control cats fed 5” per cent fat
diets, cats fed 26 per cent fat diets fre-
quently showed small amounts of histologi-
cally demonstrable liver fat. It is not pos-
sible at this time to judge whether this is
undesirable. Futhermore, we have found
that cats fed high—fat diets require more
riboﬂavin than those fed low-fat diets.9
This effect, which can be explained in great
part on the basis of altered intestinal syn-
thesis, may also apply to some of the other
vitamins.

The high-protein requirements of cats
appear related to their metabolic needs.
Two investigators6 could obtain satisfac-
tory growth in cats only when they were
fed diets with more than 30 per cent pro-
tein. Othersl6 reported that a weanling cat
retains 1.7 Gm. of nitrogen per day per
kilogram of body weight, approximately 70
per cent more than a Beagle pup at wean-
ing. They found that the adult cat with full
body stores of protein requires approxi-
mately 0.5 Gm. of nitrogen per day per
kilogram of body weight to remain in ni-.
trogen balance.

Although it has not been demonstrated
that cats require dietary carbohydrate, it
appears that if diets are adequate in pro-
tein and fat, the balance of calories can be
provided by carbohydrate.

Ash.—There have been no studies of the
quantitative requirements of cats for any
mineral. Four to ﬁve per cent mixed salts
such as salts IV14 have been used success-
fully in puriﬁed diets. Although cats are
subject to kidney and bladder stones, at-
tempts to induce calculi by the feeding of
diets containing as much as 30 per cent
ash for a year have been unsuccessful in
this and other laboratoriesﬁ’8

Vitamins—Deﬁciencies of vitamins A,
D, E, thiamine, riboﬂavin, niacin, folic
acid, BG, and pantothenic acid in cats are
summarized (table 1). No studies of cats’
requirements for vitamins B12, C, K, bio-
tin, and choline have been reported. It is
unlikely that dietary sources of vitamins
C, K, and biotin are necessary under ordi-
nary circumstances. The vitamin supple-
ments used in our laboratory and that of
another are listed (table 2). These ﬁgures
do not necessarily represent recommended
allowances. They are amounts of vitamins
which appear to satisfy the needs of young
cats for growth when fed puriﬁed rations.

DISCUSSION

Many important questions concerning
cat nutrition remain to be answered. Not

ino the other vitamins in 2 ml. of cod-liver oil.

 

only are data concerning the nutrient re-
quirements of cats for growth generally
lacking, but there have been no studies of
the cat’s dietary requirements for repro-
duction and lactation. We are unable to ex-
plain reports in the literature that foods
for cats are more nutritious uncooked than
cooked”,19 In cats, the relationship of nu-
trition to susceptibility to disease, particu-
larly mycotic infection, respiratory disease,
and urinary calculi, is obscure.

In View of the importance of cats as
domestic and laboratory animals, it seems
obvious that considerable value would be
gained from the answers to some of these
problems.

SUMMARY

The author’s personal experience and a
review of recent studies on cat nutrition
provide the following information.

1) Weanlings need approximately 250
calories per day per kilogram of body
weight, while kittens several months old
and inactive adults need only about 150
and 60‘calories, respectively.

2) Although precise fat requirements
are not known, high—fat diets are more
palatable and appear necessary for best
growth when puriﬁed rations are fed.

3) Protein requirements of cats seem to
be higher than of other animals, including
dogs.

4) Diets containing as much as 30 per
cent ash have been fed to cats for a year
without causing urinary calculi.

FARM AND INDUSTRIAL INSECTICIDES m SPRAYERS. DETERGENTS. DISINFECTANTS

 
 
  

Dear Customer:

A word about the origin of our company might be of interest to
you. In 1935, on graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology
as a chemical engineer, it was first suggested that I research the field
of industrial sanitation. Prirﬁitive methods and poisonous chemicals
were being used almost everywhere without due concern abOut contam—
ination of foods or injury to humans or animals that might be exposed

to them.

The first project we set up for our newly formed company was
to develop a safe industrial insecticide, powerful enough to kill the
large variety of insects plaguing us, yet simple enough for anyone

to handle. OMNICIDE was our first product! Omnicide was introduced
to the food industry and was enthusiastically accepted by restaurants,
brewing companies, confectioners, bakeries, etc. which are still
using this materi
market soon enlarged to animal industries, farms and animal breeders,
and to the many other branches of the exterminating field. We now
number among our customers the largest industries in this country

and many in foreign countries.

Through our close contact with varied industries, we have
experienced every type of insect and sanitation problem, and we
have developed specialized remedies and techniques for them. Some
of these specialized products and systems we now offer are OMNICIDE
NON—TOX CONCENTRATE and the Automatic Case Sprayer developed
for the breweries and soft drink bottlers; SUPERIOR "60—6" O.F. CON-
CENTRATE, completely oil free, for the canneries and research lab—
l—DUST for breeders of small animals; SPARKLEEN and
SANIWASH for supermarkets, stables, kennels; and the REFRESHAIRE
for nursing homes, hospitals and veterinarians. Most of these products
are also used by many industries other than those for which they were
developed, and several new products are now in the laboratory stage.

While non-toxic to humans and animals, OMNlClDE is so active against
insects, that it requires only 1/2 oz. to 1 oz. per I000 cubic feet of
Space. Best results are obtained by units such as the Dyna Fog or
the Microsol, which breaks up the liquid into a light fog or vapor. This
fog floats in the air killing all insects it contacts and drawing hiding

insects out of the cracks and crevices in which they breed.

ANIMAL CARE

For laboratories, kennels, stables, barns, etc. OMNlClDE is’ non-irrita-
ting, non-hemotoxic, and non-carcinogenic and can be used around and
on warm blooded animals, even around newly born calves. (Not recom-

mended for use on most cats).

For animals with long hair which keeps the mist from reaching the
hiding insects, moisten fingers with OMNlClDE and rub it directly on the
hide.

OMNlClDE KILLS ON CONTACT! With regular use,OMNICIDE builds
up a residual action, so that even for fly control, applications can be

made at longer intervals. In most areas regular users can cut their

barn spraying to twice a week.

WAREHOUSES, WOOL PROCESSORS,

CLOTHING STORES and FACTORIES,

HATTERS, BOOK BINDERS, LIBRARIES,
MUSEUMS, etc.

A planned program can protect valuable merchandise from insect damage
by moths, carpet beetles, termites, wood borers, and many other insects

that prey on fabrics, paper, leather, and wood products.

OMNlClDE is safe for use on all these materials.

NON-TOXIC INSECTICIDES
WHEN USED AS DIRECTED

SUPERIOR OMNICIDE D.F. (For outdoor use in ‘thermal foggers)

This product is virtually the same as OMNICIDE, but compounded for use in
thermal units. It has a greater percentage of Synergist to compensate for any
loss in the exposure of the insecticide to the heat. It also has a heavier oil
base so that it will not dissipate so quickly out of doors, but will remain closer
to the ground, vegetation or structures where it is sprayed. Used in this type
of equipment, the vapor will not harm plants and is harmless to warm-blooded
animals.

SUPERIOR OMNICIDE NON-TOX CONCENTRATE

A concentrated insecticide containing pyrethrins, piperonyl butoxide, and a
repellent for treating beer and soda cases. This product is diluted with water
and used principally in the SUPERIOR AUTOMATIC CASE SPRAYER. Cases
are treat-ed to kill any insects lurking in the returned boxes, and to repel any new
ones from entering while the case is away from the bottling house.

SUPERIOR OMNI-DUST — A Micronized Powder

This is a new concept in insecticides. The product is a very fine powder which
dehydrates the insect. It is activated with pyrethrins to speed the killing action
and also to flush insects out of hiding. OMNl-DUST remains active as long as
visible and even if it has been wet, once it has become dry again, its potency
will return to original strength. This insecticide is compounded for use around
animals and can actually be used on them. OMNl-DUST can be mixed with the
bedding for Small laboratory animals, or can be dusted around the sleeping
quarters of larger animals. OMNl-DUST is excellent against crawling and hopping
insects such as mites, ticks, lice, roaches, fleas, Silverfish, ants, and other
similar insects. Packed I, 5, 25 and 50 lb. Packed I oz. tubes — I2 per carton.

SUPERIOR O.F. “60—6" DIP

A highly concentrated, oil free, non-toxic insecticide, for use where even mini-
mal amounts of oil cannot be tolerated. This product is used at the ratio ofl to
200 approximately, or one ounce per 2 gallons of water, as an animal dip. Since
it is oil free, it can even be used on cats.

For Spraying purposes, dilution is at the rate of one ounce to a pint and one
half of water. For canneries, or fruit storage, loaded fruit trucks can be hosed
down with a dilution of I to 200, for protection against fruit flies and many other
insects.

SUPERIOR “IO—I” CONCENTRATE

This product is diluted with water, and is used where a very small percentage of
oil can be tolerated. ”IO—I" can be used as a dip or a spray, both around and
on animals, and in food storage and handling areas. Bins, bags, and cartons
condtaining beans, grains, and other food products can be sprayed with the
pro uct.

MUNICIPAL SPRAY — Non-Toxic, Pyrethrins and Piperonyl Butoxide spray

Compounded of the same quality, odorless, stainless ingredients as OMNICIDE,
for municipal and other Users. Exceeds most government specifications for
quality spray for use in electric fogging equipment.

DAIRY SPRAY

This is a non-toxic, odorless, non-staining, pyrethrum Spray. Exceeds the
government standard AA spray.

PRIVATE LABEL

Non-toxic Formulations containing various ercentages ranging froma AA FLY
SPRAY to semi-concentrates are also available Prices upon request.

There is no cure for rabies. No cases of
human survival have ever been reported.
Prevention of the disease by the elimina-
tion of rabies in animals and by the pro-
phylactic treatment of human beings
following exposure, are the only known
methods of protection.

Like poliomyelitis and smallpox in people,
rabies is caused by a virus. The virus is so
small that it can not be seen with ordinary
microscopes.

People, as well as animals, can get rabies.
The disease has been reported in at least 3
40 different species, including domestic
animals such as dogs, cats, cows and
horses, and wild animals such as foxes,
skunks and bats. Of all animals, however,
members of the canine family, which in—
cludes dogs, are the most likely to have and
to spread rabies.

Infected animals spread rabies to other
animals, and to people, by biting. Con—
tamination of a wound with the saliva of .
an animal which has rabies can also cause
the disease.

The virus does not enter through the
normal skin, nor can it be spread if rabies
is not present in the saliva of the biting
animal.

Wlﬂgress?

what are
some
sﬁgns

of rabies?

Dogs are most likely to spread the dis—
ease because the saliva of a rabid dog
usually contains Virus, and dogs are more
closely associated with people, thus more
likely to expose them.

Rabies occurs in all climates and seasons,
but most cases appear in late winter,
spring, or summer.

Once the rabies virus gets into the body, it
travels along the nerves to the brain. The
time it takes for the virus to reach the
brain depends somewhat on what part of
the body the bite was inﬂicted. If the bite
is on or near the head, the virus may reach

the brain in only a few days. If the bite is
on the leg, it may take longer. SymptomS
may appear within ten days or, in extreme
cases, they may not appear for many
months. The course of the disease is short,
and the animal usually dies within three to
seven days after symptoms appear.

Once in the brain of an animal which is
not immune to the disease, the rabies virus
grows and destroys the essential tissues.
Often, the ﬁrst sign of rabies is difﬁculty
in swallowing, resulting from paralysis of
the throat.

This may cause saliva to drip from the
mouth and may prevent the animal from

drinking water. These classical signs of
rabies have given it the name of hydro-
phobia (fear of water). Actually, the ani-
mal is not afraid of water but, because of
throat paralysis, it can not swallow.

A rabid dog or other animal may be-
come unusually friendly for a while, and
the Wild animal may lose its fear of people.
Dogs often appear to be blind, and may
bite at everything that moves, even biting
at and eating sticks and rocks. Eventually,
the Virus causes paralysis so that the ani-
mal can not move its muscles.

When an animal is at the vicious stage of
rabies, biting and attacking, it is said to
have the “furious form.” The animal
showing signs of paralysis, which will not
eat or drink, and which slinks away from
people, is said to have the “dumb form.”
There is really only one type of rabies
Virus, and the furious and dumb forms of
the disease have been so named because
of the different outward signs exhibited.
It is estimated that about 50 percent of
the cases in dogs are the dumb form only,
with no furious symptoms occurring.
Frequently, it is while an animal is show-
ing signs of the “dumb” form that people
jeopardize their safety by putting their
hands in a pet’s mouth in attempts to dis-
lodge the object they believe is choking it,
or in trying to help it eat and drink. A dog

with a bone in its throat will usually make
efforts to remove it. An animal with rabies
does not do this. Any animal with a
dropped jaw should be viewed with sus-
picion and should be examined immedi-
ately by a veterinarian.

Since the individual rabid cat may present what a hﬂlii
a serious problem, cat owners are encour- mtg?

aged to have their animals vaccinated for

their own protection. There is no evidence,

however, that rabies persists among cats

disease as are dogs and cats. It is much
more important to vaccinate dogs and cats,
because they are closely associated with
people.

Two types of vaccine are available, a
killed virus, and a modiﬁed live virus.
Both types are effective, and the veteri—
narian is best qualiﬁed to judge which
type to use for a particular pet.

Dogs are usually vaccinated after three
months of age, and cats after six months.
Again, the veterinarian should decide the

right time and age for each pet to be vac-
cinated.

vent them from biting other dogs or people.

Rabies virus has been found in the saliva
before an animal has outwardly shown
Signs of rabies. This is why it is so im-
portant to apprehend and restrain a biting
dOg or other animal. If, during a period of
conﬁnement, outward signs of rabies ap—
pear, or if the animal dies and laboratory
tests of its brain show rabies infection,
persons exposed to the disease by the ani-
mal can take protective treatment.

While rabies rarely occurs in pets that
have been properly vaccinated, the possi-
bility nevertheless exists, just as polio some-
times occurs in people who have been
vaccinated with the Salk vaccine. For this
reason, any animal that bites a person,
whether vaccinated or not, should be

 




placed under observation for the pre-
scribed period.

‘ When a person is bitten by a dog or other

K, animal, whether it shows signs of rabies
' or not, he should consult a physician im-

 

‘ mediately, and also, in the case of a pet,
ask the owner to take it to a veterinary
hospital for observation. If the owner is
not known or is not cooperative, the police
and public health ofﬁcials should be
notiﬁed.

A person exposed to rabies can receive
the “Pasteur treatment,” a series of injec-
tions which usually prevent the disease.
An antirabies serum is also available, and
sometimes is given along with the Pasteur

treatment. However, since the preventive
treatment for people exposed to rabies is
expensive, unpleasant, and not without
danger to the patient, the importance of
preventive vaccination for pets can not be
overemphasized.

VETERINARY TOXICOLOGY
by R. D. RADELEFF, D.V.M., In Charge, Toxicological
Investigations Laboratory, Animal Disease and Parasite Re-
search Division, Agricultural Research Service, U.S.D.A.,
Kerrville, Texas. President, American College of Vet-
erinary Toxicology, 1962-
This is the only text devoted speciﬁcally to veterin-
ary toxicological problems in the U. S. Diagnosis,
sampling for analysis, treatment and prevention are
considered fully, followed by fundamental informa-
tion on the nature and action of common actual or
potential toxicants. Drugs included in books on
pharmacology are omitted. Plants are grouped
according to their mode of action and by their
common names, and are illustrated by photographs
rather than botanical drawings. The discussion
includes latest methods of treating poisoning by
organic phosphorous compounds; chemosterilants;
teratogenic effect of plants; effects of chemical
warfare agents and of radiation; and forensic
problems. Designed to provide an understanding
of the scope and usefulness of veterinary toxicology
as a specialty in developing drugs and agricultural
chemicals, this book stresses intelligent utilization
of natural resources and management of industries
to protect livestock and domestic animals.

VETERINARY HEMATOLOGY

by OSCAR W. SCHALM, D.V.M., M.S., Ph.D., Professor of
Clinical Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Uni-
versity of California, Davis.
Blood morphology in health and disease is pre-
sented for the dog, cat, cow, sheep, goat, horse and
pig. Normal values in each animal species are
followed by a presentation of fundamental concepts
of the responses of both erythrocytic and leuko-
cytic cell series to various disease processes. Inter-
pretation of the changes in the blood picture in
disease is dealt with in detail, and attention is
directed to the differences in response to disease
among the common domestic animals as reﬂected
in blood morphology. Numerous tables of original
data are included. An appendix contains 27 cases
from the Clinic at Davis which are referred to
throughout the book in order to clearly demon-
strate fundamental concepts of the responses of
the hematopoietic tissues to disease. “The book will
serve as a guide and practical reference for anyone
concerned with this phase of veterinary clinical
pathology. . . . It provides an excellent introduction
to veterinary hematology.” Jl. A.V.M.A.

REPRODUCTION IN
FARM ANIMALS

Edited by E. S. E. HAFEZ, Ph.D., Associate Professor,
Department of Animal Science, Washington State Uni-
versity, Pullman, Washington. And 21 Contributors.

Dealing with all aspects of reproduction, this book

supplies the basic knowledge necessary for the

maintenance and increase in fertility of cattle,
sheep, swine, horses and poultry. The text is
divided into four parts covering reproductive
endocrinology; anatomy and physiology of the male
and female; patterns of reproduction, including
the species-speciﬁc characteristics of fertility and
infertility; and the effects of stress and pathogens
on reproduction. Prevention of male and female
sterility is discussed in terms of anatomy, physiol-
ogy, genetics and pathology. Abortion, conception
rates, embryonic mortality, effect of androgens on
growth, developmental horizons to determine age
of embryos, artiﬁcial insemination in horses and
swine, genetics of fertilization and implantation,
effect of aging of gametes and biochemistry of
sperm and ova are but a few of the pertinent topics
covered. Tables provide data on comparative
anatomy and physiology. “One of the most
complete and comprehensive books on animal
reproduction. There is an excellent glossary.”

PREPARED IN THE BEST INTEREST OF BETTER PET HEALTH BY THE RALSTON PURINA CO.

UROLITHIASIS IN CATS

INTRODUCTION:

One of the most dramatic conditions occurring in domestic cats
involves the formation of mineral deposits in the urinary tract.
The obvious discomfort of the afﬂicted animal coupled with the
possibility of, at best, recurrence and, at worst, mortality makes
a lasting impression on cat owners.

Unfortunately, there is no clear cut answer to the cat owner’s
query of “why did this happen?” This article attempts to sum—
marize brieﬂy information currently available.

DEFINITION:

Urolithiasis refers to the formation of a stony precipitate any-
where in the urinary passages. Other terms commonly used are
urinary calculi, bladder stones, and kidney stones.

In addition to domestic cats, this condition commonly occurs
in dogs, cattle, sheep, mink, and humans. The male is more apt
to be afﬂicted than the female—probably as the result of the
difference in physical construction.

Calculi are usually classiﬁed as to type based on the composition
of the stones. Hawk, Oser, and Summerson recognize ten varie-
ties. Of these only four are commonly encountered; uric acid
and urate calculi, phosphatic calculi, calcium oxalate calculi,
calcium carbonate calculi.

In the male cat formation of a mucus plug as a result of inﬂam-
mation in the urinary tract also results in urethral obstruction.

J

 




VITAMIN A DEFICIENCY:

In rats this condition has been observed when diets are fed which
are low in vitamin A. This may be secondary to epithelial de-
generation in the bladder as a result of the vitamin A deﬁciency.
Experience with other animals has not established vitamin A
as the sole controlling factor.

ASH CONTENT OF DIET:

Total ash content of the diet consumed has been a frequent topic
of conjecture as to its effect on calculi formation. Relatively
little controlled research has been reported with cats.

Two studies, one in England and one in this country, indicate
that growing kittens can be fed puriﬁed rations containing 30%
total ash without developing urinary calculi. In another experi-
ment, the formation of crystaline deposits in the kidneys was
observed and was found to be caused by a pyridoxine deﬁciency
in the particular experimental diet involved.

ASH ANALYSES:

The analysis statements used on cat food packages routinely
appear on an “as is” basis. And, thus, ash content of a ration as
guaranteed is inﬂuenced directly by the amount of moisture in
the package. For example, here are moisture and ash guarantees
on a dry cat food and three popular canned cat foods:

TABLE 1 Dry Cat Food Canned Cat Food
A B C

% moisture, not more than 12.0 74.0 74.0 74.0
% ash, not more than 12.5 4.0 3.5 5.0

If the ash content of each of the above rations is converted to a dry basis,
the relative total ash content of the various products is:

TABLE 2 Dry Cat Food Canned Cat Food
A B C

% total ash, not more than 14.1 15.3 13.5 19.1

Conversely, if the moisture content of the dry product is increased to the

same level as that of the canned products (74%), the relative ash content of
the four products is:

TABLE 3 Dry Cat Food Canned Cat Food

A B C
% ash, not more than 3.66 4.0 3.5 5.0
These comparative figures demonstrate that cats consuming rations of the

type readily available, whether dry or canned, are exposed to relatively uni-
form levels of ash in the feed.

EFFECT OF CASTRATION:

Calculi formation appears to be more of a problem in neutered

males although there are no reliable statistics on the actual inci-
dence in cats.

Two factors could be involved here—age at time of castration
and effect of altered hormonal balance.

Castration at an early age may impair development of the lining
of the urinary tract and subsequently predispose the animal to
formation of calculi. Castration and the resulting altered hor-
monal balance within the animal might also initiate changes in
the lining of the urinary tract which will lead eventually to stone
formation. Both factors merit further study.

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS:

Infection and invasion of the urinary tract by urea-splitting
organisms increases the alkalinity of the urine and tends to
increase the precipitation of phosphatic calculi. Other than this,
urinary pH appears to have little or no direct connection With
the development of calculi.

MISCELLANEOUS:

Various feed ingredients have been implicated over the years,
but all of these have been fed for prolonged periods without
causing calculi formation. Where cats are concerned, ﬁsh is fre—
quently blamed but no experimental work directly implicating
either whole ﬁsh or ﬁsh meal is actually available.

Failure to consume enough drinking water is sometimes cited
as a contributing factor. This is quite difﬁcult to evaluate in
the case of household pets since cat owners rarely observe rate
of water consumption. Normal cats will consume ﬁve to ten per
cent of their body weight as water daily. When a canned cat
food is used, this supplies a portion of the total water intake.

In some breeds of dogs there is evidence to indicate that the
problem is caused by a physiological defect involving the function
of the renal tubules. This defect is thought to be an inherited
condition.

SUMMARY:

Urolithiasis in cats, as in other animals where it occurs, continues
to be a puzzling situation. None of the commonly expressed
theories consistently explain the occurrence. Additional research
considering both nutritional factors and physiological factors
is needed.

Introduction

< 3/.)

During the past few years it has become more
or less routine for veterinary students, especially
upper classmen, to spend their summer vacations
with practitioners. Many members of the Ameri—
can Animal Hospital Association have participat-
ed in such a program. Questions regarding the
scope and activities of such employment have
prompted the Association’s Educational Commit—
tee, which is composed of a small animal teacher
from each college, plus four directors of member
hospitals, to devote study to the problem as it
pertains to small animal medicine.

The comments on the following pages repre—
sent the thoughts conveyed from interviews with
teachers, practitioners and students. It is hoped
that these recommendations will bring about a
better understanding and relationship between
both students and practitioners participating in
the summer employment program.

If it is found that local, state or provincial
regulations limit some of these suggestions, it is
understood that such regulations should be given
preference and be respected.

Educational Committee,
American Animal Hospital Association

 




The Practitioner

A practitioner should not consider hiring stu-
dents unless he has work enough incident to run-
ning a practice and hospital to afford ample op—
portunitv for the student to spend the greater
part of his time working with patients. Students
should not mind giving a lift with such tasks as
porter work, mowing the lawn, painting and
washing windows, provided this does not con-
sume their day. Sufficient time must be provided
for them to see and work with patients because
they come for the purpose of gaining knowledge
and experience working with veterinary problems.

The practitioner should realize that the stu-
dent trainee is well grounded in the basic sciences
but limited in clinical knowledge, training and
experience. The crowded curricula of the veterin-
ary schools leave little time for an adequate ap—
plication of the training received in business psy-
chology, hospital and office methods, hospital
maintenance. sanitation and humane handling of
patients. Care should be taken in assigning work
schedules to see that the trainee has an opportun-
ity to gain experience in all these subjects. In the
summer months the volume of practice increases;
therefore, the trainee can best act as an extra
pair of hands to work in all departments as the
occas1on demands rather than speciﬁcally being
employed as a replacement for a regular em-
ployee.

To enjoy the fullest cooperation from a stu-
dent, there should be a frank discussion before
€mPIOYment begins of the work schedule, includ—
mg hours, time off and salary. When this has
been agreed upon, the student will know What
is expected of him and what the practitioner ex-
pects to Provide. When agreement has been
€93,031“, every effort should be made to adhere
o 1 .

Under no circumstances should the trainee

be allowed to assume the duties of a licensed vet-
erinarian. The legal and moral risks as they con-
cern the patient, the client, the veterinarian and
the student are too great. Furthermore, it is a
breach of ethics to allow the student to pose as
a veterinarian, either in the office or on the tele-
phone.

It is permissable, however, for the student to
assume responsibility in the office and on calls
for some of the nursing procedures. For example,
if the student is properly instructed and the
client understands his professional status, he may
change dressings, give medicine, take tempera-
tures and even give hypodermic injections if com-
plete directions have been given by the veterin-
arian. This can be done either in the office or
at the premises of the owner. However, should
the student ﬁnd the condition of the animal is
such as to necessitate a change in the treatment,
he must not proceed without further directions
by the attending veterinarian.

Practitioners giving summer employment to
students are in a position to render a great
service for the future of veterinary medicine.
Guidance in establishing the work habits and ap-
pearance of the young veterinarian is most worth-
while. Lessons taught by the practitioner in col-
league and client relations, as well as in correla-
tion of the student’s basic knowledge with the
practical application, are invaluable and will con-
tribute to the student’s success and usefulness in
our profession.

If the proper relationship can be established
between the student and the practitioner, the
summer employment period can well be of great
beneﬁt and inspiration to both the student and
the practitioner. The student will gain from the
guidance and the experience of the practitioner
and the practitioner will be stimulated by contact
with the newer knowledge and professional en-
thusiasm of the student.

 




The Student Helper

A veterinarian is, by the nature othis work,
a diplomat. of the ﬁrst order, a phySIC1an, a hu—
manitarian, a social service worker, an executive,
a bookkeeper, a sales promotion and public rela-
tions man, a teacher, a psychologist, and a good
housekeeper. The curricula of the present day
veterinary schools are so crowded that it is im-
possible for the student to obtain ﬁrsthand in-
formation on all these subjects while in school.
The summer months can be used by the student to
broaden his scope of experience.

Summer employment also affords an oppor-
tunity for the student to investigate and learn
about many phases of practice and hosp1talman~
agement which cannot be readily taught in the
classroom. These include groomingh feeding,
maintenance, handling of patients, cleaning cages,
bookkeeping, case records and client relations.

An opportunity to receive this valuable'train-
ing should be considered the real beginning of
a professional career. It offers the student a
chance to establish the work habits. appearance
and attitude that must be assumed by a profes-
sional man. For example, he should not appear
in public in careless dress; coat and tie, plus the
other earmarks of good grooming and cleanliness
are essential to his status. If the student IS mar-
ried, the same rules apply to his wife.

The summer employment period can serve as
an intrmluction to the. general purpose of veter-
inary medicine. The student can study the veter-
inary code of ethics in action. No one veterm-
arian may be expected to excel in every branch
of the profession, but this is an opportunlty to
compare their methods, to retain those which seem
good and silently question those which seem other-

 

wise. This is a time when the student can do
extra reading and investigate clinical material,
such as clinical laboratory samples and patho~
logical specimens. He can fan'iiliarize himself
with parasites and master the technic of necropsy
examination, as well as follow through and ex—
pand his understanding of many of the problems
encountered.

Practitioners usually do not have enough
time at their disposal to go deeply into all cases.
but the student will ﬁnd it adrantageous to his
training to complete the case. Most practitioners
will not object if the student wishes to use special.
laboratory equipment, provided care is taken not
to damage it. Often it is necessary that students
do these things on their own time and in the
years to come they will ﬁnd it much to their ad~
vantage to have broadened their scope and per—
fected their technics.

The students should not expect to draw top
salaries for summer employment because they are
unable to produce in that proportion for the prac~
titioner. Their term of employment is short and
they cannot assume a regular position on the
staﬁ’. To compensate for this, students are urged
to take advantage of the opportunity to increase
their knowledge of such things as conducting a
physical examination, learning the different
breed’s characteristics and mannerisms, as well
as studying normal and therapeutic diets,

Finally, the student always should be a gen~
tleman, treat his employer with respect due a pro-
fessional man and ask for no special privileges.
He must be prompt, helpful in the practice and
cooperate to the fullest extent.

‘ The easiest way to establish hirnSelf with
his employer is to Willingly and cheerfully do
more than is expected of him.

grooms” quarters, etc. Regular use of OMNICIDE helps
keep horses from rubbing, kicking, and tossing in stalls,
eliminating the possibility of injuries. Its use improves
the appearance of coats of show animals as it helps avoid
blemishes due to biting insects.

Spray low from behind animal (in straight stalls),
enveloping him in a cloud, 1/2 to 1 oz. per stall. Use
directly on 'animals, against lice (2 oz. to animal).
With regular use, spraying against flies can gradually
be reduced to twice a week.

 

OMNICIDE kills flies, lice, ticks, gnats, bees, wasps,
hornets, spiders, stored grain pests, ﬂeas, roaches, horn
ﬂies and deer ﬂies.

OMNICIDE can be used in the show barn, ﬁtting
barn, and around new~born calves, to relieve the tor-
ment of biting insects. Premises are kept clean of ﬂy
specks on ceilings, windows and walls. OMNICIDE pre-
vents weight loss in animals, and reduced quality of
dairy products caused by ﬂy-pestering of animals (a
cow pestered by insects tosses, turns, stamps about, in
torment). OMNICIDE helps prevent sickness caused by
infectious insect bites, and improves the comfort and
disposition of show stock.

Spray under each animal, while walking the length
of the barn. Very simple, very fast . . . anyone

can do it!

OMNICIDE kills ﬂies, lice, ticks, gnats, bees, wasps,
hornets, spiders, roaches, ants, waterbugs and silverﬂsh.

The daily fogging of runs and kennels will help elimi-
nate Scratching and biting, and make animals better
tempered. Spraying the premises will insure insect-free
areas where dogs will not be annoyed, and also keep ants
out of the dogs’ food, a special problem with slow
eating dogs. Since long haired animals suffer particu-
larly from bites about the ears and head, OMNICIDE
will ease this problem.

Dogs can be sprayed with the mist, in the same man-
ner as the larger animals, or small applications may be
made directly on the fur to rid them of ﬂeas, ticks
or lice.

Animals will be free of annoying itching from ﬂeas
and lice while in the show ring.

 

 

 

 

 

It is important to keep research animals such as
mice, rats, monkeys, poultry, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs,
etc., free of insects for many reasons:

(1) to avoid self-injury caused by scratching, biting,

and rubbing to relieve pain

(2) to be kept comfortable to aid recovery

(3) to avoid the introduction of insect-carried dis-

eases that might interfere with the experiments
or weaken the/animals.

Because OMNICIDE is concentrated, very little spray
is required, so there is practically no danger of irrita-
tion of any sort to the animals. No chlorinated hydro-
carbons are contained in OMNICIDE, which could affect
the animals. There is no danger of tainting food or
water supplies.

OMNICIDE IS POWERFUL! Many times stronger
than the Government standard for AA spray! It is
non-toxic when used as directed odorless and
non-staining. OMNICIDE contains none of the chlor-
inated materials to which insects are rapidly becoming
immune. Even in places where OMNICIDE has been
in use since 1935 (the year it was introduced), there
are still no signs of insect immunity.

OMNICIDE KILLS ON CONTACT! With regular
use, OMNICIDE builds up a residual action, so that
even for ﬂy control, applications can be made at longer
intervals. Even in summer, regular users can cut their
spraying in most areas to twice a week.

OMNICIDE IS CLEAN! OMNICIDE IS ECONO-
MICAL! Because of its concentration, very little
OMNICIDE is required. It therefore avoids the dangers
of oily residues left by the settling sprays of other
materials. No oily ﬁlm coats walls, counters or other

surfaces.

OMNICIDE should be applied by a Microsol type
applicator, which breaks spray particles into a ﬂoating
mist that is carried by normal air currents into all
cracks and crevices harboring insects or eggs.

OMNICIDE HAS BEEN PROVED HARMLESS TO
LIVESTOCK, HUMANS, DAIRY PRODUCTS!
OMNICIDE IS STAINLESS, ODORLESS!

I Gaines Professional Services Department presents
this booklet as a salute to the nation’s veterinarians on
the occasion of the centennial of the founding of the
American Veterinary Medical Association. The ma-
terial in it has been compiled from the scripts of two
award-winning ﬁlms —- “The Gentle Doctor”, which
depicts the history of veterinary medicine since before
the time of Christ, and “Friend of a Friend,” which
describes a typical day in the life of a small animal

veterinarian.

Both ﬁlms were produced under the direction of the Gaines Dog
Research Center by The Institute of Visual Communication, Inc.,
from scripts written by Irve Tunick. “The Gentle Doctor” is narrated
by Burgess Meredith. In “Friend of a Friend,” the narration is by
Mel Brandt. The 'role of the veterinary practitioner in “Friend of a
Friend” is portrayed by Dr. Hadley C. Stephenson.

 




 

 

 

We call him

THE GENTLE
DOCTOR

HE IS a highly trained professional,
a scientist. He is meticulous in his
laboratory, perceptive and incisive
in his practice.

He is essentially restless, ever
probing, forever studying and con-
stantly learning. Yet, in any account—
ing, his greatest asset is patience.
For he has only one means of com-
municating with those who need his
help: a bond born of sympathy,
understanding and gentleness. For
he is a veterinarian.

He is “The Gentle Doctor”.

THESE days we hear a great deal
about “co-existence”, whether or
not two totally different ways of life

can manage to live together peace-

ably, as neighbors. Well, it’s not im-

possible because two totally diver-

gent types of life have managed to

get along rather well on this earth

for many millenniums. Man and

beast have existed side by side for

untold centuries, and although they

" ' may snarl at each other occasionally,
for the most part they share the earth under a partnership arrange-
ment that has proved effective, beneﬁcial and peaceful. They co- exist.

In the beginning, the arrangement was rather one-sided. Ancient
man took freely from the animal world all the basic necessities of
life: food, clothes, hides for shelter.

Later as his skills and intelligence expanded, man learned that
many of the creatures of the forest could be brought into a working
partnership of survival; the dog, for hunting, companionship and as
an ever-alert sentry against danger,- the cat, decorative, and a natural
enemy of mice and rats and other vermin of the ﬁelds and granaries.

The ox, the ram and the feathered bird gave him not only food but
status. His ﬂocks were the earliest mark of wealth. Still later, man
domesticated the horse, the ass, the camel and acquired tireless legs
to carry himself and his burden beyond the farthest ﬁelds. Modern
civilization begins with the alliance for survival of man and beast.

BEGINNINGS 0F VETERINARY MEDICINE

The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi tells us that veterinary medi-
cine was practiced as far back as 2250 BC.

In ancient India, the science took giant strides, and by about 250
B.C., we were told that “everywhere two kinds of hospitals were
erected, hospitals for men and hospitals for animals”.

In Greece, Hippocrates of Cos lit a beacon. He said to all practi-
tioners of the medical science: “Do no harm if you cannot do good”.
And he threw aside the demonology that sought to cure with magic
potions and vile powders and taught, instead, the relationship of
diet, climate and exercise to health and disease. And, most remark-
ably, the wisdom of ancient Greece understood that disease is no
respector of zoological boundaries. It can be transmitted from
animal to man.

college in the country. Led by a group of earnest, tireless workers,
the campaign for better education, stricter licensing and higher
professional standards, resulted in a profound change in the public’s
attitude toward the practitioners of animal medicine.

That object of scorn and sarcasm, the “horse doctor”, became the
“vet”, a highly-respected, most valued member of society, ready to
serve with science the animal population of his community.

And science, as never before, was prepared to serve. The second
half of the 19th century saw a surge forward in medical knowledge
unequalled in all of time. Pasteur proved his germ theory of disease,
the importance of inoculation for both prevention and treatment,
and in America the veterinary profession was among the ﬁrst to
understand and utilize this most dramatic medical breakthrough.

EPIDEMIC DISEASES UNDER ATTACK

Armed with new knowledge, surer techniques, higher skills, many
veterinarians began a concerted attack on the epidemic diseases that
periodically swept the land. The campaign that would ﬁnally elimi—
nate Hoof and Mouth disease in American cattle was begun. As early
as 1892 contagious pleuropneumonia, once the killer of scores of
thousands of cattle every year, was wiped out.

Dourine and glanders diseases that had cost. horse-breeders mil—
lions of dollars loss a year, were brought under control and ﬁnally
eradicated. Bovine tuberculosis, which carried the killer microbe
from cattle to man, was eliminated in over 99% of all U. S. cattle,
with the result that bone and glandular tuberculosis in man has
virtually disappeared.

L OOKING back but a century, the record almost deﬁes belief. Diseases

once rampant, plagues, scourges, have literally been wiped from
the American scene. Bovine brucellosis, rabies, canine distemper, hog
cholera and scores of other animal killers have either been eliminated
or brought under control. And in every case the key, the doer, was
the veterinarian.

It was a veterinarian who discovered dicumarol, the anti-coagulant
now widely used in treating heart disease in humans. A veterinarian
solved the mystery of botulism (food poisoning), paving the way for
the canned food industry.

And it was a veterinarian who developed one of the most important
fracture immobilizing devices now widely used by bone specialists.

might be just not feeling up to par, time for a routine check-up or
a get acquainted call. When the day rolls around, it’s reassuring to
know that a veterinarian is not too far away, ready to help us over
the rough spots, someone to trust.

The veterinarian’s road begins with a basic college education, fol-
lowed by four years of specialized study in veterinary medicine at
one of the nation’s 18 veterinary colleges. Long hours of probing

ACCIDENTS will happen. Sud-
denly a frolicking pet one mo-
ment, a whimpering, bewildered
little pup the next. Not too long
ago, there may have been little
hope, but veterinary medicine
has come a long way in tech-
niques that save and restore.

Examination shows a broken
leg. First, aseptic preparation,
then a sedative is necessary for
complete examination of the in-
jured patient.

X-rays determine the exact ex-
tent of the injury. Skill, training
and knowledge are principal fac-
tors in both human and veteri-
nary medicine.

A Thomas-type splint is ap-
plied to the injured limb. Other
types of breaks might call for
the ﬁtting of a special splint using
bone-pinning techniques, a pro-
cedure ﬁrst used on animals and
today widely adapted for human
use. Now that everything’s set,
nature takes over.

So go the morning ofﬁce hours.

Benadrul

[diphenhudramine
hudl‘ﬂchlﬂl'ide)

Parke-Davis

for veterinary use

Benadryl® (diphenhydramine hydrochloride, Parke-Davis) , a
chemical compound synthesized by Rieveschl and Huber, pos-
sesses both antiallergic and antispasmodic activity. This syn-
thetic chemical affords relief of certain allergic manifestations
and is effective in relieving spasm of smooth muscle. Diphen-
hydramine hydrochloride is useful in a widely diversiﬁed group
of clinical conditions whose common denominator seems likely
to be some abnormality of histamine metabolism.

In responsive conditions, some beneﬁcial effects may be
expected within a few hours following administration. Diphen-
hydramine hydrochloride is palliative only and symptoms tend
to recur when the drug is discontinued. It does, however, fre-
quently afford welcome relief during the period required to
determine etiology and subsequent treatment. Since diphenhy-
dramine hydrochloride is nonnarcotic and possesses a wide range
of tolerance, it can be used -for extended periods without un—
toward effects.

CIIHICBI AppllC'dlIUﬂ There has been an abundance of experimental
and clinical work reported on the close association of histamine
to allergy. Chemicals which compete with histamine for a place
on the body cell act as blocking agents and prevent histamine-
induced tissue reactions and manifestations of allergy. It is
theorized that, by this action against histamine, Benadryl

 




 

(diphenhydramine hydrochloride) affords relief in many cases
of dermatoses, including eczema-like conditions which some-
times may be due to obscure allergies.

Allergic reactiOns in animals, as in humans, show a variety
of symptoms; but in animals they may develop spontaneously
or be inﬂuenced by heredity.1 Allergy in animals can be readily
produced experimentally, and many actual clinical cases have
been recorded. Wittich2 described annual recurrence of hay fever
in dogs; and food allergies in dogs are known to exist.3 The in-
creased interest in veterinary allergy Studies was mentioned by
Coca4 in citing the endeavors of various workers. This work
includes ﬁndings on allergies in dogs and cattle“ and horses.8’9
Antelyes10 reports good results in treating apparent allergic
reactions in dogs.

Diphenhydramine hydrochloride is indicated for the treat-
ment of skin itch and other dermatoses in dogs because of its
ability to decrease the cutaneous vasodilating action of hista-
mine and further, because of its favorable effect on allergic
responses to certain drugs.11 Drug allergy in one of its many
manifestations frequently occurs after previous exposures to a
drug. One reason suggested for its frequency was the indis-
criminate use of such drugs as sulfonamide compounds.12

_ Taylor13 obtained fair to good results in clinical cases of
dermatoses treated with diphenhydramine hydrochloride, while
good results were reported in 80 per cent of all allergy cases
treated at the Michigan State University veterinary clinic.14’15

lUEElaﬁQE and {WW Numerous animal experiments, including those
of Gruhzit and others,16217 have been conducted to determine the
acute toxicity of diphenhydramine hydrochloride. All animals
remained under observation for one to two weeks following
treatment. The results of these studies are summarized in Table I.

Additional experiments were conducted on dogs, albino rats,
and mice15’17 for the purpose of determining chronic toxicity.
In dogs, diphenhydramine hydrochloride was administered orally
for a period of several weeks to six months. Animals receiving
10 to 20 mg. per-Kg. body weight daily in two divided doses
for a period of six months remained in good health and were
free of toxic reactions. The hemopoietic system of all animals
receiving 40 to 60 mg. per Kg. remained undisturbed. Anemia
or leukopenia was not encountered, and the blood total non-
protein nitrogen and urinary analyses showed no abnormal
changes.

Intravenous administration of 2.5 mg. per Kg. in dogs
caused no reactions.

Histopathologic studies on animals receiving 10 to 24 mg.
per Kg. perorally and 2.5 to 10 mg. per Kg. intravenously re—
vealed no pathologic changes in the various organ tissues.

 




 

PRE CA UTIONS: Depression, drowsiness, salivation, and emesis
have been reported. Hypnotics or sedatives when indicated for
animals receiving Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride)
should be administered with caution. Make intravenous injec-
tions slowly and dilute solutions stronger than 10 mg. per cc.

WARNING: Benadryl (diphenhydramine hydrochloride) is not
recommended for use in meat-, egg- or milk-producing animals.
The length of time that residues persist in milk or tissues has
not been determined.

DOSAGE
ORAL ADMINISTRATION

 

20- to 35-Pound Dogs

One ’25-mg. Benadryl (diphen—
hydramine hydrochloride) cap-
sule every 12 hours.

 

35- to 50-Pound Dogs

One 50-mg. Benadryl (diphen-
hydramine hydrochloride) Kap-
seal every 12 hours. .
Others: 1 mg. per pound of body
weight.

PARENTERAL ADMINISTRATION

20- to 35-Pound Dogs

1.5 to 2.5 cc. of Benadryl (di-
phenhydramine hydrochloride)
solution intravenously.

 

35- to 50-Pound Dogs

2.5 cc. to 3.5 cc. of Benadryl

(diphenhydramine hydrochlo-

ride) solution. Desired results

are usually obtained quicker by
. intravenous administration.

It is suggested that frequent, small doses are most effective.

CLINICAL APPLI CA TION

Oral and Parenteral
BACTERIAL PULMONARY INFECTIONS OF DOGS AND CATS

Pulmonary infections are quite common in dogs and cats, especially
during the cool, damp seasons. Schirmer and his associates1 demon-
strated that 25 mg. chloramphenicol per pound body weight adminis—
tered orally every eight hours is effective in these animals with
pneumonia. The product form for intramuscular use was also found
to be effective.2 Treatment should be continued for three to ﬁve
days after the animal has become afebrile.




 

URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS OF DOGS

The effect of chloramphenicol on bacillary and coccal infections of the
urinary tract has been studied extensively. While it is controversial as
to whether bacteria are primary or secondary invaders, urinary tract
infections continue to be very common in dogs.

Since a large fraction of the total dose of chloramphenicol is elimi-
nated through the kidneys, it is extremely valuable in the treatment
of bacillary and coccal urinary infections. Schirmer and his co-
workers1 found chloramphenicol, administered orally to dogs, to be
effective in 92.6 per cent of cases of urinary infections due to Esch-
erichia coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, hemolytic staphylococcus, strepto-
coccus, Corynebacterium renalis, and Proteus vulgaris. To success-
fully treat urinary tract infections, in most cases, chloramphenicol
should be administered orally at the rate of 15 to 25 mg. per pound
(approximately 30 to 50 mg. per Kg.) body weight every eight hours.

GASTROENTERITIS OF DOGS

WITH ACCOMPANYING DIARRHEA

Clinical experiences of Gasow3 and Eastman“ and their associates
show chloramphenicol to be highly effective in the treatment of acute
diarrheas of dogs. Investigations indicate that 25 mg. per pound
(approximately 50 mg. per Kg.) body weight successfully treated
gastroenteritis in the dog. One dose per day is usually sufﬁcient.

INFECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CANINE DISTEMPER

Chloromycetin (chloramphenicol) provides the wide-spectrum anti-
bacterial action needed to combat the great variety of bacterial
invaders usually present in secondary infections during the course of
canine distemper. Several investigators“4 have found the drug to be
effective in approximately 75 per cent of dogs having the secondary
bacterial invaders. Ordinarily 25 mg. per pound (approximately 50
mg. per Kg.) body weight every eight hours is a satisfactory dosage
schedule.

INFECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

INFECTIOUS FELINE PANLEUKOPENIA

Infectious feline panleukopenia, better known as infectious feline
enteritis or cat distemper, is a highly contagious disease of young cats.
Although the causative agent is a ﬁltrable Virus, chloramphenicol was
found in one series1 to be effective in 91.6 per cent of treated animals.
Complete recovery usually followed the administration of 50 mg.
twice daily regardless of the animal’s size.1

INFECTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

INFECTIOUS FELINE PNEUMONITIS

The Virus of feline pneumonitis belongs to the psittacosis-lympho-
granuloma venereum group because of its mode of reproduction and
antigenic structure.5 In vitro studies6 of this group show signiﬁcant
inhibition by chloramphenicol. Brown2 found that a single injection
of 100 mg. intramuscularly helped alleviate signs of illness.

 




 

Oral Only
HARD PAD DISEASE OF DOGS

The majority of researchers agree that “hard pad disease” (hyper-
keratosis) is a form of distemper, basically a viral infection. Reports
indicate that chloramphenicol, presumably because of its anti-
bacterial action, shortens the course of this disease and lessens the
severity of the nervous syndrome which often follows protracted
cases"9 Administration of chloramphenicol early in the disease
resulted in an almost total absence of any destructive central nervous
system sequelae. An initial dose of 500 mg. chloramphenicol
followed by 250 mg. three times daily for four days gave good results.
A marked drop in temperature and a general clinical improvement
followed in most cases 8 to 24 hours after administration.

COCCIDIOSIS OF DOGS

Coccidiosis is a disease of young dogs. Clinical infections vary in
severity from those with mild diarrheas for a few days to severe infec—
tions causing bloody diarrhea, anorexia, weakness, and emaciation.5
Majilton,10 in a study of 74 cases of coccidiosis in dogs covering a
2V2—year period, found chloramphenicol to be a useful drug in treating
this condition when administered in doses of 25 to 50 mg. per pound
of body weight each 24 hours for 4 days.

BACTERIAL DIARRHEA OF COLTS

Prior to the advent of chloramphenicol, bacterial diarrhea of colts
was a serious and often rapidly fatal disease. It is usually caused by a
bacillus of the coli type which invades the body through the intestine.
Eastman and co-workers4 observed that a young colt with severe
diarrhea made complete and dramatic recovery following the oral
administration of chloramphenicol. They recommended that 1 Gm.
be given orally once daily for two days.

Parenteral Only

ACUTE OTITIS MEDIA OF DOGS

Dogs with pendulous or heavy ears have poor drainage and ventilation
of the auditory canal and are predisposed to infections which may
extend inward. Sensitivity tests have repeatedly shown bacteria from
ear discharge specimens to be highly sensitive to chloramphenicol.”14
In acute infections, antibiotic therapy is often helpful and is most
effective when given either parenterally or orally for systemic effect.5
Since chloramphenicol has a broad spectrum of activity against both
gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, rickettsiae, and the larger
Viruses,15 the actual causative organism in each instance would seem
relatively unimportant. Hayes16 stated, “On a number of clinical
cases of otitis media, we have found Chloromycetin (chlorampheni-
col) administered intramuscularly to far exceed in therapeutic value

 




 

 

 

 

any drug previously employed. This type of infection has been
extremely difﬁcult to treat.”

Topical
BACTERIAL CONJUNCTIVITIS

Chloramphenicol is very useful in veterinary ophthalmology. Magrane17 V
and co-authors reviewed literature which showed that chloramphenicol
used locally, either as an aqueous solution or in an ointment form, will
penetrate through an intact corneal epithelium and will not delay its
regeneration when diseased. He also noted that chloramphenicol
penetrates the vitreous and aqueous humors following oral adminis-
tration. Similar results have been reported by Leopold18 in his
study with rabbits.

BACTERIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY
TO CHLORAMPHENICOI.

The wide range of gram—positive and gram—negative bacterial patho—
gens sensitive to chloramphenicol was ﬁrst demonstrated in 1949,6
and has since been conﬁrmed by numerous investigators. In vitro
susceptibility of some of the commoner pathogens in veterinary prac—
tice, as reported in 1960, is listed in Table 2. In the interim, the
staphylococcal problem has come to the fore. Experimental develop-
ment of bacterial resistance to chloramphenicol by staphylococci in
vitro occurs comparatively slowly and only to a moderate degree.
Strains of decreased susceptibility to chloramphenicol are relatively
short-lived, both in vitro and in vivo. In a comprehensive survey of the
principal published reports covering a 10-year period and relating to
staphylococcal infections in humans, it was found that the over-all
incidence of chloramphenicol-resistant strains was less than 10 per
cent. Incidence of chloramphenicol-resistant forms appears unrelated
to frequency and intensity of use of this antibiotic.19 In summary,
development of resistance to chloramphenicol can be regarded as
minimal for staphylococci and many other species of bacteria.

PHARMACOLOGY

Chloramphenicol is D-threo-2—dichloracetamido—1—p—nitrophenyl-1,3—
propanediol. It is insoluble in vegetable oils; moderately soluble (0.5
per cent) in water, urine and serum; and 15 per cent soluble in propyl-
ene glycol. It is rapidly absorbed, metabolized, and excreted.20

Blood Concentrations

The majority of organisms susceptible to chloramphenicol are strongly
inhibited by concentrations of 4 micrograms per cc. or less (Table 2).
Since chloramphenicol is partly bound to serum proteins,“21 a ﬁgure




 

of 5 to 10 micrograms per cc. of serum, as determined by microbiologi-
cal assay, probably represents a clinically effective blood serum level.
Blood serum concentrations within this range are obtained in the dog
with oral doses of 15 to 25 mg. per pound (approximately 30 to 50 mg.
per Kg.) body weight every eight hours.21'25

Dogs

Following the original work of Glazko and associates,20 Eads and his
co-workers21 demonstrated that chloramphenicol is rapidly absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract of dogs. Chloramphenicol serum levels
were roughly proportional to the dose size, and maximum concentra-

tions in the blood occurred within two hours after administration
(Fig. 1).

Following administration, chloramphenicol is inactivated by con—
jugation with glucuronic acid and excreted in the urine and bile. On
the basis of indirect evidence, that portion of the drug reaching the
intestinal tract is probably hydrolyzed to form chloramphenicol,
which may then be reabsorbed into the blood stream. Such a cycle may
be of special importance in the treatment of diarrheas of dogs and
could explain why low doses of chloramphenicol are often effective.

Horses

Brook and Paris,24 using chemical determinations, studied blood
serum levels in horses weighing 665 to 826 lbs. Dosage ranged from '7
to 15 mg. per lb. body weight, orally, either by stomach tube or by
gelatin capsule. Administration of 7 mg. chloramphenicol per pound
body weight in a single dose by stomach tube produced peak serum
levels of approximately 30 micrograms per ml. within one hour. No
chloramphenicol could be detected in the serum after three to four
hours. Increasing the dose to 31 mg. per Kg. body weight produced
peak serum chloramphenicol levels of approximately 80 micrograms
per ml. within one hour and no drug could be recovered from the serum
after ﬁve hours.

Doses of 15 or 16 mg. per Kg. body weight, administered by gelatin
capsule, either gave no detectable serum levels or measurable levels of
7 micrograms or less three hours or more after administration. Doses
of 27 to 33 mg. per Kg. body weight produced peak serum levels rang-
ing from 35 to 82 micrograms per ml. within one to three hours after
administration (Table 3).

In additional studies in horses, these investigators24 administered
three equal consecutive doses of 31 to 33 mg. chloramphenicol per
Kg. body weight, either by stomach tube or by gelatin capsule, at
approximately four—hour intervals. Peak serum levels, ranging from
54 to 91 micrograms per ml. occurred one hour after the ﬁrst dose with
steadily decreasing peak levels following the second and third doses.

Tissue Concentrations

The highest tissue concentration of total drug, determined by the
titanium method, was found in the kidneys and liver of each animal
tested following administration of Chloramphenicol, with progressively
smaller amounts in the lungs, spleen, heart, muscle and brain. In the
dog, concentrations of 109, 81, 43, 37, 32, and 23 micrograms of total
nitro compounds per Gm. of tissue were found in the kidney, liver,
lung, spleen, heart and muscle, respectively, one and one-half hours
after subcutaneous injection of 35 mg. Chloramphenicol per Kg. of
body weight. These values dropped by more than 50 per cent in three
hours. Brain and spinal ﬂuid had 15 and 7 micrograms per Gm. at one
and one-half hours. A value of 21 micrograms per Gm. was recorded
for blood plasma, but by far the greatest concentration—875 micro-
grams per Gm.—was found in the bile.‘~’0 It is assumed that free chlor-
amphenicol comprised only a small fraction of the total drug measured.

Excretion

Chloramphenicol is excreted in animals principally in the form of in—
active nitro compounds through the kidneys and liver, as evidenced
by high concentrations in the urine and bile following dosage. The
kidneys of animals account for a considerably smaller share of the
total dose than do the kidneys of man in whom approximately 90 per
cent is excreted by this route within 24 hours. Glazko and co-workers20
obtained 54.7 and 67.8 per cent recovery of total nitro compounds in
the urine of 2 dogs; less than 8 per cent of the total dose was recovered
as active Chloramphenicol. However, large concentrations of nitro
compounds were found in the bile of dogs and guinea pigs following
dosage. Further experiments by these investigators in rats showed that
as much as three quarters of the administered dose of Chloramphenicol
was excreted into the intestinal tract from the biliary system within
8 to 12 hours.

Tolerance and Toxicity

Extensive pathologic and toxicologic studies have shown Chlorampheni-
col to be relatively nontoxic and well tolerated in domestic animals.
Nausea and vomiting are rare, even when large doses are given. In

 

11

 

 




 

 

tests conducted by Gruhzit and his associates,25 dogs given an oral
dosage of 50 to 100 mg. per pound (100 to 200 mg. per Kg.) body
weight ﬁve or six days a week for a four-month period showed no
cumulative toxic effects. The animals remained in good condition and
maintained or increased their original body weights. The hematologic
values of these dogs remained relatively unchanged. The leukocyte
counts of treated animals remained in normal range and varied
slightly from the pretreatment values of 7,400 to 15,900 (average
12,400) to the last counts of 10,200 to 14,100. per ml. (average 12,900) .
The total nonprotein nitrogen in all animals remained in a normal
range. Differential counts in the above dogs ranged from 71 to 90 per
cent neutrophiles, 10 to 17 per cent lymphocytes and scattered eosino-
philes and mononuclear cells. No tendency to agranulocytosis or
abnormal cell morphology was observed.

A total of 16 dogs have received high doses (50 to 200 mg. per Kg.
twice daily or more) of chloramphenicol daily for one month or longer
either by mouth or intramuscularly. No animals showed at any time
agranulocytosis or a signiﬁcant depression of red blood cells or hemo-
globin associated with drug administration. Bone marrow examina-
tions showed no abnormalities.26

Schirmer and his co-workers1 reported no visible untoward reactions
in dogs and cats even when 150 mg. per pound (312 mg. per Kg.) body
weight was administered on four successive days. During one phase
of their blood studies, Eads and his associates21 administered 200 mg.
per pound (approximately 400 mg. per Kg.) body weight in divided
doses at 6—hour intervals for 24 hours (50 mg. per pound every 6
hours) with no apparent undesirable reactions.

It is evident from these studies that dogs receiving dosages of
chloramphenicol well above those recommended for maximum thera-
peutic activity for extended periods of time have not shown evidence
of any blood dyscrasia.26

I Elase® [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] is a combination of two
Iytic enzymes. It is highly effective in enzymatic de-
bridement of necrotic tissues in wounds and in the
liquefaction and dissolution of undesirable exudates of
the skin and mucous membranes. Its action helps to
produce clean surfaces and thus to promote healing
in a variety of exudative lesions.

This drug is indicated intravaginally where, among
other effects, it promotes rapid removal of necrotic
debris associated with vaginitis and cervicitis. It is of
similar benefit in rapid removal of exudates issuing from
wounds, ulcers, or burns on the surface of the body and
in irrigation of abscess cavities, hematomas, sinus tracts,
and fistulae. In these conditions, the use of this agent
has not been accompanied by significant side effects.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] is supplied in two forms:
a lyophilized powder and an ointment. Both these
product forms contain sodium chloride, sucrose, and
thimerosal (mercury derivative) used as a preservative
during the manufacture of fibrinolysin.

Each vial of the lyophilized powder contains 25 units
(Loomis) of fibrinolysin and 15,000 units of desoxy-
ribonuclease with 0.1 mg. thimerosal (mercury deriva-
tive). The contents of each vial may be reconstituted
with 10 cc. of isotonic sodium chloride solution. Higher
or lower concentrations can be prepared if desired
by varying the amount of the diluent. To be maximally
effective, the solution must be freshly prepared before
use. Within six hours after preparation half its potency
is lost at room temperature. Even when stored in a
refrigerator, the solution should not be used longer than
24 hours after reconstitution.

The Ointment is supplied in 30-Gm. tubes, each con-
taining 30 units of fibrinolysin and 20,000 units of
desoxyribonuclease with 0.12 mg. thimerosal (mercury
derivative) in a special ointment base of'liquid petrola-
tum and polyethylene. Six disposable vaginal applica-
tors (V-Applicator*) as a separate package are available
for this tube to facilitate administration of the proper
dose.

The Ointment is also available in 10-Gm. tubes con-
taining 10 units of fibrinolysin and 6,666 units of desoxy-
ribonuclease with 0.04 mg. thimerosal (mercury deriva-
tive) in a special ointment base of liquid petrolatum and
polyethylene. This tube has an elongated nozzle to aid
in application to surface lesions and cannot be used
with the vaginal applicators.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] meets all requirements
for safety and potency prescribed for this product by
the National Institutes of Health.

This drug should not be used parenterally.

I TOPICAL USES

I SIDE EFFECTS

I CONTRAINDICATIONS

Since the conditions for which Elase [fibrinolysin
and desoxyribonuclease, combined, (bovine),
Parke-Davis] is helpful vary considerably in sever-
ity, dosage must be adjusted to the individual case;
however, the following general recommendations
can be made:

In mild to moderate vaginitis and cervicitis, 5 cc.
of the Ointment should be deposited deep in the
vagina once nightly after retiring for approximately
five applications, or until the entire content of one
tube is used. Patient should be checked by the
physician to determine possible need for further
therapy. In more severe cervicitis and vaginitis,
some physicians prefer initially to instill 10 cc. of
the solution intravaginally, waiting one or two
minutes for the enzyme to disperse and“ then
inserting a cotton tampon in the vaginal canal. The
tampon should be removed the next day, followed
by as many applications of the Ointment as appear
necessary.

Selection of the product form and the duration of
treatment must to a great extent be left to the
discretion of the physician. It should be clearly
understood that after application the enzymatic
activity of this agent, especially in solution, be-
comes rapidly and progressively less active and is
probably exhausted for practical purposes at the
end of 24 hours. The dry material for solution and
the Ointment are stable at room temperature
through the expiration date stated on the package
(three years from date of issue).

Deleterious side effects have not been a problem
at the dose and for the indications recommended
herein. Even at much higher concentrations, side
effects have been minimal, consisting entirely of
local hyperemia. The usual precautions against
allergic reactions should be observed, particularly
in persons highly sensitive to materials of bovine
origin.

This drug is not recommended for parenteral use
since the bovine fibrinolysin may be antigenic.

There are no known contraindications to its topical
use as herein recommended.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] is useful intravagi-
nallywhere it promotesthe rapid removal of necrot-
ic debris and purulent exudates associated with
vaginitis and cervicitis. It is similarly useful in aid-
ing in the rapid removal of exudates on the surface
of the body associated with wounds, ulcers, and
burns. The efficacy of each of the constituent
enzymes is reinforced by their combination since
purulent exudates consist largely of fibrinous ma-
terial and nucleoprotein. Desoxyribonuclease
attacks the DNA in dead tissue and exudates, and
fibrinolysin attacks the protein portion of dead
tissue, exudates, and blood clots largely derived
from fibrin.

The activity of desoxyribonuclease is limited
principally to the production of large polynucleo-
tides,1 which are less likely to be absorbed. in
contrast, certain enzyme preparations obtained
from bacteria may liberate more diffusible prod-
ucts, thus increasing the probability of unde-
sirable side reactions.

The fibrinolytic component is directed mainly
against denatured proteins, such as those found
in devitalized tissue, while protein elements of
living cells remain relatively unaffected. It tends
to be preferentially adsorbed onto fibrinous ma-
terial2 in contrast to those fibrinolytic enzymes
which attack protein-containing substrates. Some
of these latter may even attack living tissue.

Furthermore, the fibrinolytic component of the
drug is itself the active enzyme rather than an
activator of bacterial origin which functions only
in the presence of an adequate amount of pro-
fibrinolysin. This is an important consideration in
treating patients suffering from lesions resulting
from impaired circulation. Also, undesirable side
reactions such as chills and fever attributable to

It is well to bear in mind that many patients on
whom the present clinical discussion is based had
been previously treated by other therapeutic
measures without success and so may be regard-
ed as a highly refractory group.

Inflammation of the cervix is an important prob-
lem in gynecology and obstetrics. Cervicitis is
frequently caused by infection which tends to
follow in the wake of some traumatic experience
such as childbirth, curettage, instrumental de-
livery, or cauterization. Regardless of etiology, the
basic pathology is usually associated with varying
degrees of inflammatory exudate.

I POSTPARTUM CERVICITIS

taken from a total group of more than 600 patients
are shown in Table 1.

Evaluation of therapeutic effect was based
principally on changes, as visualized and meas-
ured, in gross appearance of the cervix. Complete
healing or disappearance of erosion occurred in
more than 65 per cent of patients, and improve-
ment, consisting of appreciable reduction in the
size of the lesion, was observed in an additional
20 per cent. Cervical lesions in approximately
11 per cent of patients apparently failed to re-
spond to therapy during the period of observation.
Symptoms of irritation, leukorrhea, itching, burn-
ing, and odor when present were relieved. No
drug-induced untoward effects of any kind were
noted in any patient.

Childbirth is a traumatic experience and many
gynecologic ills arise therefrom. Minor cervical
pathology such as erosions, incompletely healed
lacerations, and purulent mucoid discharge with
cervicitis are frequently seen in patients at their
first postpartum checkup. Elase [fibrinolysin and
desoxyribonuclease, combined, (bovine), Parke-
Davis] when applied after delivery eliminates much
of this cervical pathology. Nightly application of
the Ointment for three to five days has been found
to constitute adequate management in the usual
case.

In one clinical study3v'6 with suitable controls,
the use of various combinations of the ingredients
of this product resulted in striking improvement
in the majority of a group of patients with post-
partum cervical erosions and cervicitis (Table 2).
The total study group of 48 patients was separated
into four equal groups of 12 patients each, com-
parably constituted with regard to such factors
as age, parity, and frequencies of complications
of labor and delivery. One group of 12 received
a placebo and each of the other groups received
one of the enzyme combinations numbered,
respectively, V, VI, and VII. Treatment consisted

of self-administered ointment given nightly for
approximately seven applications. Follow-up was
complete in all cases and clinical improvement
was assessed both from the standpoint of the
abatement of symptoms and photographic evi-
dence of healing as compared with controls re-
ceiving the placebo. As indicated by the data in
Table 2, there was good correlation of results
as judged by the two methods of determination.
Although there was little to choose between the
two stronger enzyme combinations, one contain-
ing an antibiotic, the results definitely showed
the beneficial action of enzymatic debridement.

used to effectively control these sequelae. ln-
vestigators have noted that this preparation helps
to eliminate the postelectroconization necrotic
cervical plug, thus avoiding hemorrhage which
often follows discharge of the plug on the eighth
to eleventh postconization day.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] was used in treating
more than 600 women suffering from various
forms of vaginitis. A sample characteristic of the
entire group is listed in Table 3. It is apparent that
generally favorable results were obtained in cases
of nonspecific and senile vaginitis. There were no
untoward systemic effects and patients usually
reported striking and prompt symptomatic relief.

ln nonspecific vaginitis, results were uniformly
good, consisting of complete cessation of dis-
charge and complete relief from pruritus and in-
flammation within 24 hours after application.
Treatment usually consisted of nightly applica-
tions of the Ointment for three to five days.

In senile vaginitis, the drug enhanced healing
and apparently eliminated nonspecific infection
as effectively as in the group with nonspecific
vaginitis.

l n mycotic vaginitis, results were less favorable.
Vaginitis caused by Monilia was not significantly
inﬂuenced.

 




I TRICHOMONAL VAGINITIS Vaginitis associated with and presumably caused
by trichomonal infection responded remarkably
well to the use of Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxy-
ribonuclease, combined, (bovine), Parke-Davis].
Subjects of study were 159 private patients listed
in Table 3 and 500 institutional patients drawn
from two women’s prisons. Trichomoniasis was,
of course, much more prevalent and extensive
among the prison inmates than among private
patients. From 75 to 80 per cent of the inmates
examined were found to be infected, and probably
had been for years. Positive diagnoses were based
on smears or cultures or both as well as on clinical
symptoms.

 

All patients treated with this product obtained
symptomatic relief from discharge, itching, burn-
ing, irritation, and odor. Approximately 60 per cent
of private patients obtained symptomatic relief
after a treatment period of 5 to 10 days. Cul-
tures and smears after three months did not
generally indicate curative effect; however, symp-
tomatic relief was reported.

 

Of the several dosage regimens tried among
the penal inmates, best results were obtained
in the group which received the particular com-
bination containing 50 units of fibrinolysin and
25,000 units of desoxyribonuclease for a period
of five days. Despite the high degree of resistance
shown to any type of therapy by such a group, this
regimen produced negative cultures and clear-
ance of symptoms in approximately 85 per cent
of these patients, according to the six-month
posttreatment examination. Some 30 per cent of
the patients who received 30 units of fibrinolysin
and 15,000 units of desoxyribonuclease were
similarly benefited.

In spite of symptomatic relief in all patients
treated, the recurrence rate of trichomoniasis
was higher than that observed in earlier studies
in which the opportunities for reinfection were
slight.

I GYNECOLOGIC SURGICAL
COMPLICATIONS

I BURNS“.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] provides the surgeon
with a useful debriding agent in a considerable
variety of surgical techniques. Surgical wounds
that have responded well to the use ofthis prepara-
tion include second- and third-degree burns, ulcer-
ations, small gangrenous areas of the extremities,
sinus tracts, fistulae, hematomas, abscess cavities
(including empyema), wounds, and pyodermas.

Enzymatic debridement with this product offers
the advantage of selective removal of necrotic
tissue, leaving healthy tissue intact and clean
surfaces for healing. Successful use of enzymatic
debridement depends on several factors: (1) the
enzyme must constantly contact the substrate;
(2) accumulated necrotic debris must be peri-
odically removed; (3) the enzyme must be re-
plenished at least once daily; and (4) secondary
closure or skin grafting must be employed as
soon as possible after optimal debridement
has been attained. It is further essential that
wound-dressing techniques be performed care-
fully under aseptic conditions and that selected
systemically acting antibiotics be administered
concomitantly.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] either as the Oint-
ment or solution, applied topically for five days
produced gratifying results in a number of patients
with vaginal, postsurgical complications such as
wound dehiscence, abscess, or a granular area
following radical vulvectomy with groin dissection.
Healing was facilitated as a consequence of rapid
enzymatic debridement and the patient’s hospital
stay was thereby reduced to half the usual time.

The lytic action of Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxy-
ribonuclease, combined, (bovine), Parke-Davis]
can be used with benefit in the management of

11

I ULCERATED LESIONS 3:4

second- and third-degree burns. In one study on
patients suffering second- and third-degree burns,
several of which were infected, the application of
the enzyme combination in conjunction with sys-
temic antibiotic therapy produced results con-
sidered excellent to good in the majority of cases.

The thick, fibrinous coagulum of a second-
degree burn usually responded to three 12-hour
applications of this enzyme combination. The sur-
face substrate of a deep second-degree burn
which involves not only the entire thickness of the
epidermis but also portions of the dermis is com-
posed of cellular coagulum and denatured col-
lagen and is often quite resistantto lysis. Enzymatic
debridement of such a lesion with the drug is best
accomplished by applying the Ointment, or solu-
tion as a wet dressing, twice daily. This procedure
usually removes the bulk of necrotic tissue within
72 hours. The wound is then ready for skin grafting.

In a third-degree burn involving more than
10 per cent of the body’s surface and in which
immediate excision and skin grafting are im-
practical, the product should be applied as an
ointment or as a solution either by wet dressing
or through catheter irrigation. Dressings are
changed twice daily. With this procedure, the
wound should be ready for skin grafting in five
to seven days.

In the extensive third-degree burn involving
more than 25 per cent of the body’s surface,
debridement is delayed until the third or fourth
day, or until the patient is physiologically sta-
bilized. In these cases, also, the use of the product
was found to be usually beneficial.

Ulcerations found in patients with varicose veins,
arterial ischemia, or unhealed burn wounds are
lesions consisting of granulation tissue on a

 




‘4

 

chronic inflammatory base and accompanied
by pain, burning, and itching. They frequently
become infected. lschemic ulcers include decubiti,
as well as those due to arteriosclerosis and dia-
betes mellitus. The surrounding epithelial ele-
ments of all such ulcers are heaped up and sensi-
tive to minor trauma. Situated in the depth of
the wound may be portions of exposed fascia
or tendon sheath undergoing slow necrosis. The
wound contains an exudate of necrotic tissue
elements, fibrin and bacteria.

Infection of ulcerative surfaces, according to
Coon,4 is one of the major factors which delay
healing or prevent definitive operative correc-
tion of these defects. Since bacteria thrive on
fibrinous debris in open wounds, there is good
reason for elimination of fibrin and other protein
debﬂs.

The time-honored application of wet saline
soaks under moderate pressure will by dilution
decrease these elements somewhat with each
change of dressinngUnless carefully applied,
however, saline soaks can increase the irritation.
By this method, the simple ulcer may require
8 to 10 days to prepare it for skin grafting and a
deep ulcer with necrotic fascia may require sev-
eral weeks of continuous saline therapy.

A rather striking contrast is provided by the
use of Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease,
combined, (bovine), Parke-Davis]. Daily applica-
tions of the Ointment will frequently clean the sim-
ple ulcer and prepare the wound for immediate
grafting within 48 hours. The dressing technique
consists of first unroofing the ulcer by removing
the dry eschar, if present, and then applying the
enzyme twice daily under a double layer of gauze
and an occlusive dressing roll to maintain the
enzyme in contact. The use of rayon-impregnated
gauze helps prevent adhesion to the surface of
the lesion. The doubled nonadherent dressing is
utilized for two reasons: (1) it is nontraumatic for

13

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

14

I WOUND INFECTIONS3'4

frequent dressings and (2) it maintains contact be-
tween the enzyme and the substrate. Depending
on the extent and duration of ulceration, the num-
ber of applications necessary for complete de-
bridement will vary. In the great majority of cases,
the product will clean the wound in three to five
days, preparing a suitable base for skin grafting
if that is contemplated.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] has been found to be
a most satisfactory agent in debridement of in-
fected wounds, such as fistulae, sinus tracts, and
abscess cavities. The enzyme is applied through a
trough, tube, or bottlelike structure. A maximum of
enzyme substrate contact is insured. However, the
fluid media must be changed every 8 to 10 hours
to reduce the effects of by—product accumulation
and to minimize the loss of activity attendant
upon exposure of the enzyme to a liquid en-
vironment.

The exudate in these wounds, which consists
largely of fibrin, necrotic fascia, and granulation
tissue, is quickly and atraumatically removed by
the use of this enzyme combination. If the lesions
are circumferential wounds or sinus tracts, the
product may be instilled through a punctured
catheter in a gauze roll wrapped over a single layer
of nonadherent wound contact dressing. The
catheter is irrigated with a saline solution of the
product every three hours in sufficient volume to
maintain saturation of the undersurface of the
gauze roll. Accumulating by-products of enzymatic
action are thus constantly diluted and absorbed
into the dressing.This type of dressing may remain
in place for a longer period of time than those
previously described herein, but it should be
changed every 48 to 72 hours.

Larger abscesses, empyema cavities, and
fistulae or sinus tracts should be irrigated with a
saline solution of Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxy-

ribonuclease, combined, (bovine), Parke-Davis]
which is then left in place for six to eight hours. On
draining the cavity during the first 48 hours, one
will note an initial increase in purulent exudate.
Thereafter, the amount of exudate gradually di-
minishes until traces of blood appear in the dis-
charge. This bloody discharge usually indicates
active filling in of the cavity. Enzyme application
may be volumetrically reduced, and the time lapse
before changing the solution lengthened to 24
hours.

Complete lysis of the clot was effected in one
study by the use of Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxy-
ribonuclease, combined, (bovine), Parke-Davis].
The procedure employed consisted of cleansing
and sterilizing in the usual manner, followed by the
use of a local anesthetic such as procaine. As
much blood as possible is aspirated through this
area, utilizing a 16- or 18-gauge needle. The en-
zyme combination, containing 25 to 50 units of
fibrinolysin in 10 to 20 cc. of solution, was then
injected through the same needle. After 10 to 30
minutes the hematoma was again aspirated and
the cavity irrigated with physiological saline to
remove any excess of the drug.

Good results by the use of fibrinolysin alone
had been reported previously by Margulis and
Brush5 in a series of 38 patients with blood clots.
These included 19 cases of subcutaneous hema-
tomas following trauma or surgery, 2 cases of
hemothorax, 12 cases of blood clots in the geni-
tourinary system, 3 of the central nervous sys-
tem, and 2 others. The authors warned that
enzymes must be used cautiously in neurosurgery
because of the possible danger of reactivating
hemorrhage.

Blood clots or fibrinous exudates occur in asso-
ciation with a number of pathologic conditions of
the urinary bladder and renal pelvis. Reference
has already been made to the 12 patients with
hematomas of the genitourinary system treated
successfully with fibrinolysin by Margulis and

Brush.5 Blood clots occur in the bladder after
suprapubic prostatectomy and in patients with
tumors of the bladder. Lysis of these clots by the
use of Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease,
combined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] has been re-
ported as very satisfactory.3

The Ointment was applied with benefit to several
infants circumcised at the time of birth or shortly
thereafter. By this means, it was possible to ob-
serve the complete period of operative healing
while the infants were still at the hospital. On the
basis of comparison with an equal number of in-
fants receiving a placebo ointment, the response
of the treated group was rather marked. lnfants
treated with the product were free from inflamma-
tion and exudate, and healing was complete at the
time of discharge four to six days after operation.

Elase [fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-
bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] has been reported of
therapeutic value in chronic purulent sinusitis,
acute and chronic suppurative middle ear disease,
and obstructive auditory tube salpingitis with
associated deafness. The liquid enzyme is nebu-
lized directly through the eustachian catheter
when the latter is placed in the nasal ostium of the
tube. The enzyme in conjunction with decon-
gestants will reduce edema and mucoid blockage
so that air inflation and, finally, bougie passage
through the tube is possible.

In cases of chronic purulent sinusitis where
malodorous pus is repeatedly evacuated by
irrigation, the product is of value. Characteristic of
the diseased sinus is ulceration of the lining
mucosa and bacterial invaders deeply imbedded
within the submucosa. The enzyme digests off the
encrusted slough and thus makes possible greater
effectiveness of any locally applied antibiotic.

The drug has been of definite help in keeping
dry for longer periods old mastoid cavities pro-

 




 

 

 

duced by radical operation and prone to remain
chronically exudative.

Its beneficial value has also been demonstrated
in certain cases of deafness amenable to treat-
ment by bougie manipulation of middle ear struc-
tures through the eustachian tube. In such cases
the tube has been greatly narrowed or occluded
by encircling edema, thus barring passage to
either decongestant spray or bougie. This closed
passageway has been successfully opened by the
use of this enzyme preparation on the tip of a
bougie. it breaks down and lubricates membra-
nous adhesions and softens the indurated resist-
ant mucosa.

PHARMACOLOGY Elase lfibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease, com-

bined, (bovine), Parke-Davis] is a combination of
two lytic enzymes, fibrinolysin or plasmin and a
nucleolytic enzyme, desoxyribonuclease. The fi-
brinolysin is derived from bovine plasma and the
desoxyribonuclease isolated in a highly purified
form from bovine pancreas.

I FIBRINOLYSIN The protease, fibrinolysin, is present in plasma
and serum in the form of an inactive precursor,
profibrinolysin,6v7»8 which can be extracted and
activated. Fibrinolysin used in this product is pre-
pared by activation of the precursor with chloro-
form, as described by Loomis and co-workers.6

Fibrinolysin is a water-insoluble, saline-soluble,
nondialyzable euglobulin with an isoelectric
point of pH 5.5. The Loomis unit of fibrinolysin
is arbitrarily defined as that quantity which will
liquefy 1 ml. of a 0.3 per cent fibrin clot in 120
seconds at 45 C. in an imidazole buffered sys-
tem at pH 7.2. The use of 0.3 per cent fibrin clot
is chosen inasmuch as it is comparable in fibrin
content to a plasma or whole blood clot.

Bovine fibrinolysin is antigenic and may produce
sensitivity or anaphylaxis when injected repeat-
edly. The proteolytic activity of fibrinolysin com-

17

I DESOXYRIBONUCLEASE

pared with that of trypsin and many other pro-
teinases is distinguished by the primary produc-
tion of relatively large, soluble split products,
which are further hydrolyzed at a much slower
rate and to a lesser extent.‘°v” Purified blood
proteins other than fibrin may be hydrolyzed by
fibrinolysin in the test tube, but in the blood they
are largely protected by antifibrinolysin.

Inasmuch as fibrinolysin is an enzyme protein,
methods of inhibition exist. In addition to the
action of antifibrinolysin, fibrinolysin may be
rendered inert by the action of sodium thiogly-
collate, guanidine hydrochloride, urea, plasma or
serum, or the application of heat.

In the dry state, fibrinolysin is highly stable. In
solution, enzymatic activity is lost in six to eight
hours at room temperature or after several days
at 3 C. In our experience, antibiotics such as
penicillin and Chloromycetin® (chloramphenicol,
Parke-Davis) when combined with our enzyme
product have no adverse effect on its enzymatic
activities.

Desoxyribonuclease is a nucleolytic enzyme
isolated in a highly purified form from bovine
pancreas by modifications of the method de-
scribed by Kunitz.‘2 Pancreatic desoxyribonu-
clease is a relatively small water-soluble protein,
having a molecular weight of about 60,000 and
an isoelectric point of approximately pH 5. The
enzyme is activated by bivalent cations in tissue
fluids, maximal activity occurring around pH 7.
The dry enzyme is stable for long periods, but in
solution its activity may fall gradually over a
period of days at 5 C. or deteriorate more rapidly
at room temperature.

One unit of desoxyribonuclease is defined as
that amount which causes the fall of one rela-
tive viscosity unit in 2.5 ml. of a solution of highly
polymerized DNA in 10 minutes at 25 C. from
the initial relative viscosity of 4.

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

I TOLERANCE STUDIES‘3

Pancreatic desoxyribonuclease catalyzes the
hydrolytic fission of certain internal bonds in the
giant molecules of desoxyribonucleic acids (DNA),
with the result that many fragments of smaller
size are produced. This fragmentation results in
a dramatic fall in the viscosity of solutions of DNA
or DNA protein complexes demonstrated prac-
tically in the case of purulent exudates.

The Ointment in 1/2-02. tubes was tested for pos-
sible irritation of mucous or serous membranes
in monkeys, dogs, and rabbits. The ointment
contained in each tube 25 units fibrinolysin and
approximately 15,000 units of desoxyribonuclease
in a petrolatum-type base.

Evidence for vaginal irritation in monkeys was
equivocal. Immediately following a control period
in which vaginal smears were taken daily for
three consecutive days, 0.5 cc. of each of two
ointment forms was instilled intravaginally in
each of 2 monkeys. Vaginal smears were pre-
pared immediately prior to each instillation and
a final smear was taken two days after the third
instillation. Smears remained normal with 2
monkeys, but in the other 2——one for each enzyme
concentration—smears were bloody, with some
evidence of inflammation in one animal. Thus no
consistent pattern of drug-related irritation was
in evidence, and it is thought the bleeding noted
in 2 test animals was probably related either to
manipulation or to cyclic changes not in evidence
during the control period.

The Ointment was instilled into the conjunctival
sacs of one dog and 2 rabbits. One-quarter inch of
ointment expressed from an ophthalmic ointment
tube was applied in the dog's eye at hourly in-
tervals for six consecutive hours. No irritation
was noted. In the rabbits, slight to considerable
conjunctival congestion of one-half to four hours’
duration followed instillation, a greater congestion
following use of the more concentrated product.

The Ointment did not produce any significant
irritation in the monkey vaginal tract or dog eye.

In order to determine the exact antigenic po-
tency of any live virus distemper vaccine, it is
necessary to establish the minimum number of
virus infectious units needed to immunize sus-
ceptible dogs.

Some independent studies3»4 have indicated
that, with egg—cultivated distemper vaccines,
the number of virus units needed to im-
munize a dog is somewhere between 50 and
250, while other studies5 indicate that be-
tween 1000 and 3000 units are needed to pro-
duce such a response.

In a theoretically “perfect” vaccine, of
course, one virus unit would be equivalent to
one immunizing dose. Tissuvax D-H is the
ﬁrst distemper vaccine to approximate this
ratio. Critical studies with. various dilutions
show that it is possible, under controlled ex-
perimental conditions, to produce signiﬁcant
antibody response with only 3.5 virus units.

“This fact would indicate that

the tissue culture vaccine is

at least 50 times more potent than
generally appears to be the case
with live Virus distemper vaccines
prepared in embryonated eggs.”1

because it is a tissue-culture vaccine,

TISSUVAX D-H

is virtually free from
foreign protein particles
which can delay
antigenic response. . .

produce anaphylactic reaction

. . . and reduce ‘
; . . “It is possible that large amounts of foreign protein
vaccme SOlUblllty present in egg-cultivated vaccines may serve to bind
vaccine virus. Since the tissue culture vaccine con-
tains little foreign protein, fewer virus particles there-

fore would be required to initiate multiplication in
the dog.”1

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




TISSUVAX D-H

rapidly stimulates

protective response

Repeated tests with Tissuvax D-H show the
rapidity with which an immune response is
produced by this vaccine.1

In dogs inoculated with the vaccine in nor-
mal concentration*, antibodies appeared as
early as 5 to 8 days after vaccination. In
contrast, previous studies with egg-adapted
vaccines have shown that virus concentrations
at least ten times greater were required to
stimulate detectable antibodies by the tenth
day after inoculation.6

*Even though, experimentally, dilutions of the
vaccine have proved effective, it must be em-
phasized (as the graph indicates) that a full
dose should be administered to assure a rapid,
high antibody response.

Degree of Effectiveness1

“Although titrations in dogs showed that the virus composing
this vaccine is highly immunogenic, it was considered equally
important to know how effective it would be in a larger group
of dogs. Therefore, other dogs were vaccinated by a number of
veterinary practitioners in various parts of the country. Serum
samples were taken from each dog at the time of vaccination,
and again 3 to 4 weeks later. All serums were evaluated for anti-

 




bodies by the serum-neutralization test. Results with 61 sus—
ceptible dogs vaccinated in the ﬁeld and 44 in the laboratory
are grouped according to age, and summarized . . . ” (see table).

“The average titer for these dogs was 1:125,000 per 0.05 ml.
of serum, a very high antibody response for a distemper vaccine.
In previous studies7 with a chick embryo live virus vaccine,
an average titer of only 1:1500 was obtained. However, even
with the tissue culture vaccine, the individual variation in anti-
body response was rather wide, ranging from a low of 1:160 to
more than 1:1,000,000. Four of the 105 dogs failed to develop
any antibodies during the 3 to 4 week post-vaccinal period. It is
important to recognize that such failures, as well as occasional
low titers, are to be expected and represent individual biological
variation.”

and TISSUVAX D-H is safe

“In laboratory studies, two or more susceptible dogs were kept
in the same room or pen with each group of inoculated dogs, to
serve as contact controls, and all ate and drank from the same
containers. These controls were for the purpose of determining . . .
whether vaccine virus spread to the susceptible contact controls
. . . The fact that the control dogs remained serologically negative
throughout the study indicated that . . . the vaccine virus did
not spread from inoculated to un-inoculated dogs.

“Clinical observations on vaccinated dogs in the laboratory,
as well as temperature records kept on most experimental dogs,
provided further evidence of vaccine safety. At no time were
there any signs of illness following inoculation.”

 

 

 




 

' g.
N“ .

‘11’3‘,

 




Tissuvax D-H has been shown to produce an excep-
tional booster effect. This has been demonstrated in
a group of dogs which were reinoculated 4 to 6 months
after primary vaccination (even though their average
titer at the time was 1 :150,000). Results, as shown in
the accompanying graph, were impressive. A rise in
titer began on the ﬁfth day after inoculation, and in
ten days reached a peak that normally could not be
expected as a result of vaccinating susceptible

dogs.1

 

and TissuvaX D-H protects against

both distemper and hepatitis . . .
without risk of “virus conﬂict”

 

To determine whether immunological response to the
tissue culture distemper virus might be impaired by
the presence of hepatitis virus, 27 test dogs simulta—
neously received a full dose (over 5,000 virus units)
of modiﬁed live hepatitis virus vaccine. In these dogs,
immune response to the distemper virus was in every
respect equal to that in dogs given the modiﬁed dis-
temper virus alone. Similarly, the distemper virus did
not prevent a full immunological response to the

hepatitis virus.1

 

 




 

TISSUVAX D-H provides veterinarians with
a dependable, practical, and economical program

for the protection of puppies and adult dogs
against DISTEMPER and HEPATITIS

Two 1 cc. injections of TissuvaX D-H, three
weeks apart, are recommended for basic immu-
nization of puppies or any dog which has re-
ceived serum. It is estimated that about 85%
of all puppies lose their natural passive immu-
nity (and, conversely, Will respond to vaccina—
tion) by the time they are nine weeks old. The
ﬁrst dose of Tissuvax D-H is recommended at
this age, or as soon thereafter as possible, to
immunize a majority of the puppies before the
chances of exposure to the diseases are in-
creased. A second dose is recommended at
twelve weeks of age because the interfering

levels of passive immunity disappear in prac—
tically all puppies by this time, although in
rare cases the interference may persist for six-
teen weeks and possibly longer. Similarly, if
the dogs have been given serum or the puriﬁed
globulin solution, two injections of Tissuvax
D-H are recommended. ‘The ﬁrst dose should
be given two weeks after administration of
serum or globulins, and the second dose three
weeks later. With older dogs, a single 1 cc. dose
is sufﬁcient, Whether given for primary immu-
nization or as a booster to reinforce waning
levels of protection.
