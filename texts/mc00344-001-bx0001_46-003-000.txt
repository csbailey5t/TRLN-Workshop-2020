Getting ToKnow You?

Gorilla, 1, And Mother

By George Landau
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

What do you get a gorilla for his
first birthday?

Other gorillas.

Mshindi, born at the St. Louis 200
one year ago today, is getting reac-
quainted with his lowland gorilla
parents after having spent most of
his life with humans. -

Last week, Mshindi’s keepers be-
gan letting him interact with his
mother, Kivu, at the 200's Jungle of

the Apes. Until then, Mshindi had
been living at the Children’s 200
because Kivu had been unable to
nurse.

In their recent encounters, Kivu
has held her son and nibbled on
him gently. But Mshindi found the
experience hairy. At one point, he
hit his mother and gave her fur a
strong yank. Kivu threw Mshindi
down but didn’t injure him.

For the next few weeks or
months, depending on their prog-
ress, Mshindi and Kivu will spend
most of their time out of the public
eye. Eventually, they will be put
with the other gorillas, including
Jo-Jo and Fred, either of whom
could be Mshindi’s father.

But for a birthday party Sunday,
Mshindi made a special appear-
ance before a throng of admirers at
the Jungle of the Apes.

About 200 people, many of them
Zoo Parents who have “adopted”
Mshindi for a $25 donation, pressed
against the glass of the gorilla cage
to get a glimpse of Mshindi. A han-
dler carried him in after the adult

gorillas had been lured outside.

Mshindi weighs 18 pounds and
stands about 2 feet tall. He spent his
first moments in the cage gaping at
the other primates -— many of
them his size —— behind the glass.
Then he ambled up to the glass and
banged his palms on it; children on
the other side did the same, giving
rise to a brief game of patty-cake.

“He’s such a character, such a
ham. This is right up his alley,” said
Kathy Miller, one of eight zoo vol-
unteers who spent several evenings
each month baby-sitting with
Mshindi earlier this year.

“He’s just like a typical first
child: adored, petted and pam-
pered,” said Miller, of Clayton. “He
has all the confidence that comes
from having all this attention.”

Mshindi has nearly 300 200 Par-
ents, all of whom were invited to a
party and lecture that preceded
their chance to see the birthday
boy. Cupcakes, apple juice and hot
chocolate were served to the
guests. A caketopped With a ba-
nana made of icing went uncut.

Mshindi didn’t attend the party,
so he wasn’t able to open several
gifts and cards. One child gave him
a bag of pennies. Another wrote
and illustrated a gorilla storybook.

When the partygoers finally laid
eyes on Mshindi, they burst into a
chorus of “Happy Birthday.” But
for some reason, no one included
the parody ending so often used to
taunt young humans.

No one sang, “Happy birthday,
dear Mshindi, you belong in the
zoo.”

Ten inches of annual rainfall in San Diego
can’t compare with the 100-plus inches
common in steamy rain forests. But a
computerized fog and irrigation system
for a new rain forest exhibit at the San
Diego Zoo has convinced a lot of flora and
fauna otherwise.

The system is the key climate control for
the 3-acre, $6 million Tiger River com-
plex. Modeled on an Asian rain forest, it’s
the most ambitious part of a 15-year mas-
ter plan to reorganize zoo attractions. In—
stead of seeing, for example, only pri—
mates or only reptiles together, you’ll see
a collection of mammals, birds, reptiles,
and plants from the same ecosystem all
exhibited in the same place. Other zoos in
the West—notably in Seattle and recently
in Fresno-—are working on the same pre—
mise, but the San Diego Zoo is pioneering
this idea on the grandest scale.

Visitors, creatures, and some 500 species
of plants feel the cooling fog from high-
pressure emitters operating at 1,000 .psi.
The fog is so light that it won’t get you~
or your camera—wet.

Amid vegetation growing denser by the
day, you’ll see exhibits that teach about
the world’s most critieaily endangered
habitat. Estimates of annual rain forest
loss range up to acreage the size of Ne-
braska. as tropical countries destroy for-
ests for crop land, grazing land, roads,
and ﬁrewood.

Chuck Coburn, the 200’s chief horticul-
turist, began collecting exotic or especial-
ly large specimens for the rain forest years
ago. The result is the 200’s most expensive
and diverse botanical collection. You’ll
see some of Southern California’s tallest
palms. Easter lily vines curl up trees,
hitching a ride to the sun, while Dendro-
bium orchids grow on trunks. You’ll also
see the 200’s only China lace trees and a
rare Indian tulipwood.

Tiger River features some hundred birds,
mammals, and reptiles representing 35
species. But the animals aren’t always
easy to spot. Their new habitats let them
take full advantage of their natural cam—
ouﬂages—speckled ﬁshing cats sit in a
mud-cliff den, striped tigers lurk behind
thick bamboo, and green water dragons
lie on green branches. But none of the
animals are behind bars. You view tigers
through l'/2-inch-thick glass, birds
through a mesh of piartai wire, and ti:
tapir family across a moat.

The zoo, in San Diego’s Balboa Park, is
open 9 to 4 daily. Admission is $8.50
adults, $2.50 ages 3 through 15. For in-
formation, call (619) 234-3153. D

A horticultural bonanza has always re-

the new Tiger River rain forest only adds
more treasures to enjoy.

go’s benign climate, is a jungle-like gar-
den of more than 500 species of mostly
tropical plants.

and orchids cling to the tree
trunks and branches.

Tiger River’s designers took great pains
to use water efﬁciently. There is
supplemental irrigation from under-
ground sprinklers, but the soil here

can hold much more water than

thin jungle soils can. Also, a high-
pressure fog system reduces the

plants’ need for water.

Beyond that, plants

are situated

According to zoo horticulturist Chuck
Coburn, Tiger River “engenders a sense
of the beauty and connectedness of a real
tropical rain forest.”

Natural jungles have worldwide impor-
tance. They are a source of unknown
numbers of plants useful as sources for
food and medicines. And they affect cli-
mates thousands of miles away.

Many of the plants at Tiger River are
from the 200’s own collections. They come
from recent explorations in Southeast
Asia, from hobbyists, and from bo-
tanical gardens. An important
function of Tiger River is to
introduce promising
plants, whatever
their source, to
gardeners.

Plants you shouldn’t miss

Of the hundreds of plants here,
many are extremely rare. Only
about 50 are currently labeled. Here
are brief descriptions of several of the
most notable; those in bold type are locat-
ed on our map.

The seven tall feathery palms just past the
entrance are kentia palms (Howea for-
sterana). Take a good look, because these
may be the tallest, at some 40 feet, you’ve
ever seen. Six-foot specimens for ofﬁce
buildings and large rooms are pricy; these
35-year-old beauties are as close to price-
less as most palms ever get.

You’ll often encounter Easter lily vine

(Beaumontia grandzﬂora) in the Tiger
Pia“ sci-en. with one specimen growing
right near the entrance. You can see that
it’s heavy and strong, a good choice for a
substantial trellisﬁthough it may be
more interesting just rambling up a tree,
as here. It bears hundreds of fragrant,
‘ white, 4-inch ﬂowers wherever it reaches
' full sunlight.

Beside the trail’s ﬁrst resting bench is
China lace tree or Chinese princess (Ra-
dermachera sinica), a plant that’s been
used a lot lately for decorating homes and
7 oﬂices. This one, at six years old, is about
8 feet tall and looks promising as a land-
. scape plant.

Just past the last kentia palm and near the
China lace tree is one of the 200’s recent
successful introductions, Sykes coral tree
(Erythrina sykesii). Of all the coral trees
currently available, this one is probably
best for home gardens. After monitoring
, its performance here for several years,
several Southern California wholesale
nurseries have added it to their catalogs.

The coral tree is host to many other
= plants. Gingers and liriope surround its
base, a giant Burmese honeysuckle (Loni -
cera hildebrandiana) clambers up it, and
several staghorn ferns are attached to it.

From ground to treetops,
the exotic and familiar

A few steps down the trail, you might
detect a scent reminiscent of jasmine tea.
The source is a small vine growing at the
top of the wall, just above some benches.
It’s called Arabian jasmine (Jasminum
sambac), and it’s a plant of real distinc-
tion. In Hawaii it’s called pikake, and its
sweet ﬂowers are strung to make leis; in
Asia, they add fragrance and ﬂavor to tea.

One of the most popular plants in the
garden is among the least exotic. An
angel-wing tree begonia, B. coccinea,
grows 6 to 7 feet tall; it’s loaded with
ﬂowers year-round. Available from a few
w'holesalegrowers, it promises to be an
excellent landscape plant where the cli-
mate permits; elsewhere, it can be grown
on sheltered patios or in a greenhouse.

While you’re admiring the begonia, look
to its upper right on the upper cliﬂ” face to
see a large staghorn fern. Growing
through the middle of the fern is a'ﬁcus
seedling, slowly sending roots to the soil.
It’s a scene right out of a real jungle.

Here and there at about shin height in this
same area is another ﬁcus, a drought-
tolerant new hybrid horticulturist Coburn
has unofﬁcially dubbed F pumila carica.
It is low and sprawling like the familiar
creeping ﬁg, but has larger leaves and
doesn’t climb. Give it full sun near the
coast, partial or full shade inland.

Rambling over tree-stump supports is an-
other vine worth attention, Saigon orchid
vine (Bauhinia saigonensis). Coburn says
it has potential for home gardens (it’s not
yet available).

The next plant to notice as you continue is
important in a diﬂerent way. Rauvolﬁa
javanica has been used by tropical peoples
for a variety of medicinal preparations,
but it’s still fairly new and unexplored by
our own doctors and scientists.

One of the garden’s most outstanding
plant specimens, Mexican tree fern (Ci-
botium schiedei), is on the upper right
side, just above the Marsh Aviary. Grown
for at least 40 years at Hunter-Rosecroft
Begonia Gardens on Point Lorna, this one
is said to be a better example of this fern’s
genetic potential than can be found any-
where else, in nature or otherwise.

The scene here is pure jungle pandemo—
nium. Cymbidium orchid clumps arch out
to almost touch branches of an Indian
laurel ﬁg (F. microcarpa) that reaches
across from the other side of the trail,
with a honeysuckle growing well up in its
midst. Below are other exotics, among
them Griselim'a lucida, leatherleaf ferns,
ca’st—iron plant (Aspidistra), and lady
palms (Rhapis excelsa and R. humilis).

Bamboos: golden, giant, dwarf

A bamboo used extensively at Tiger River
is Bambusa vulgaris ‘Vittata’. You can
hardly miss its golden stems with green
stripes. (Sometimes called painted bam-
boo, it’s also pictured on page 86.) Maxi-
mum stem (more correctly, “‘culm”) di-
ameter is about what you see now, around
4 inches; height is up to 50 feet.

If you’re attracted to the really big bam-
boos, look for a planting immediately be-
hind the slender loris area. Called Java
bamboo {Dendrocalamus asper), it’s the
largest grown in the United States: full-
size culms are 8 inches in diameter, and
height passes 100 feet. (The largest
known bamboo has lZ-inch-diameter
culms and grows to 160 feet.)

The foot-high, grassy ground cover along
the left side of the trail is Pygmy bamboo
(Arundinaria pygmaea). Conﬁned in a
planter, it spreads fast and makes a dense
cover. When foliage starts to look tired,
zoo workers simply shear it to ground
level. Within weeks, it has fresh leaves.

Gingers to smell and gingers to eat

Next, look for red stamens contrasting
with clear yellow petals on one of the
hardiest ornamental gingers, kahili
ginger (Hedychium gardneranum). Ex-
tremely fragrant, it grows about 8 feet
high, with something of a bamboo look to
it. These tender plants, greenhouse-grown
throughout the West, are useful in the
landscape in low-elevation California.

Culinary or true ginger (Zingiber oﬁicin-
ale) is also a native of Asian jungles;
you’ll ﬁnd it near the exit on the left side
of the trail. More widely adapted but less
showy than kahili ginger, it has a kind of
grassy, bamboo look. Roots are usually
“harvested in winter, and they store well.
You can also grow it in pots, breaking off
small pieces of root to use in cooking. [I]

ouch as 3 per ent from 1969 to 1986.

Scientists in the arctic investigation
believe both sunlight and stratosgiheric
eiouds of ice crystals are essential to
the processes by which chlorine-based
chemicals rapidly destroy ozone.

The most important of the chemi-
cals are the CFCs, relatively non-reac-
tive gases used as refrigerants in air
conditioners and refrigerators, as
propellants in aerosol sprays, as
cleaning agents for computer circuit
boards and in foam plastics.

All. the chemical reactions that
destroy the ozone shield take place in
the stratosphere, which begins about
43,000 feet above the Earth’s surface.

Between the ground and . the
stratosphere is the tmposphere, and
very little mixing or interaction occurs
"between them. But chemicals that do
move between the two layers include
the CFCs, which are so chemically
unreactive that they can survive in the
troposphere for more than a century.
Within only ﬁve years, they are able
to drift upward into the stratosphere,
where they are exposed to intense
ultraviolet radiation.

Global winds circling the Earth
tend to move air from the equatorial
region toward both poles, and these
winds carry the chlorinesbearing res-
ervoir compounds with them.

During the cold, sunless winters of
the polar regions, large-scale cyclonic
wind systems, called stratospheric
vortices, form over the poles. Some-
times . clouds of microscOpic ice
crystals form, and these polar ice
clouds have become the main focus
afor the scientists investigating ozone
destruction.

Chemical reactions that might take-

place only very slowly in a simple
mixture of gases can occur much
more rapidly when the gases are
exposed to sunlight and in contact

with a crystalline surface like that of ,

the particles in polar ice clouds.

hazards. .. .
Ozone is a compound in which
three oxygen atoms are bound to-
gether. It is formed in the stratosphere
when intense ultraviolet radiation
from the sun splits ordinary oxygen
molecules, consisting Of two oxygen
atoms, into their highly reactive
individual atoms. Most of the single
atoms quickly recombine as ordinary
, oxygen gas, but some join together as
. triplets to form ozone.
In 1974, scientists suggested a
mechanism that might result in the
‘ depletion of ozone by man-made
chemicals. Dr. F. Sherwood Rowland
of the University of California at
. Irvine and Dr. Mario J. Moiina, now
‘ Of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, concluded from experi-
ments and theoretical calculations
~ that compounds called chlorofluoro—
carbons, or CFCs, would eventually
. rise from the ground and destroy
ozone in the stratOSphere.
A Moreover, they concluded that the
, chlorine involved in the reaction could
react over and over again, so that a
single CFC molecule could destroy
tensor hundreds of thousands of
molecules Of ozone.

What remains to be determined is
whether similar zones Of ozone

Recently, the National Oceanic

seems to have moderated slightly.
However, the apparent small im-

of ozone depletion is reduced, the
agency said.

Scientists believe that many Of the

- FORT MEADE —- Two dogs were taken
Friday from a Fort Meade man who was
charged with cruelty to animals after
county animal control officers saidthey
saw the dogs beaten. ’

The largerdog, a mixed pit bull, also
bore an open wound from where a metal
chain is believed to have cut a circle
around his neck. _,

The dogs were taken to'a Lakeland vet-
'erinarian for treatment. Within 10 days

f the Polk County Humane Society plans to
file for custody of the animals.

David Washington faces a first-degree
misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum
$5,000 fine and 'a year in jail, said Zelle
Windham of the Humane Society.

The case was turned over Thursday to
Windham of Winter Haven. She is Polk’s
only animal cruelty investigator.

Polk County animal control officers
learned of the case Wednesday when they
placed the pit bull into a 10-day quaran-

smaller dog suffered head wounds and a

Because the attack involved another

NEW YORK TIMES - November 1, 1988

ASHINGTON, ‘ ’Oct. 31

(AP) - The Fish and

Wildlife Service has

agreed to consider listing
the marbled murrelet, a robin-sized
seabird of the Pacific Northwest, as

.j _ an endangered species.

Listing the bird as endangered or
threatened could result in a ban on
cutting trees that are prized by the
timber industry for their top-quality
logs and premium market price.

Not much is known about the bird,
which seems to swim better than it
walks or flies, but scientists believe it
nests almost exclusively in the upper
branches of old-growth timber, an-
cient trees that tower over the coastal
regions of the Northwest.

The wildlife agency found that a
National Audubon Society petition for
listing the bird “presented substan—
tial information indicating that the

 

 

requested action may be warranted.”
But spokesmen for timber industry

groups said environmentalists were
using the bird in a “backdoor” at-
tempt to prevent logging of old-
' growth timber on public lands.

‘Let’s Not Play Games’

“It sounds like a red herring,” said
JayGoldstein, a spokesman for the
Washington Forest Protection As.
sociation, which includes among its
members some of the largest forest-
products companies in the North-
west.

“We need to decide what to do and
get on with it,” Mr. .Goldstein said.
“But let’s not play games and use soft
little birds to defraud the process.
These never-ending tactics aimed at
foiling the process are irresponsible.”

Environmentalists do not deny that
they want to halt the cutting of old—
growth timber, but they say the mar-
bled murrelet is worthy of protection
in its own right.

“We are going to make the survival
of the ancient forest a national issue,”
said Brock Evans, an Audubon Soci-
ety vice president.

Caught in the middle is the Fish
and Wildlife Service, which recently
declared that another bird that nests
in old-growth timber, the spotted owl,
was not worthy of listing as endan-
gered or threatened. That decision
has been challenged in Federal Dis-
trict Court in Portland, Ore.

"‘What we have to answer is how
important is old growth to the mar-

 

 

,bled murrelet,” said Jim Bottroff, a

Seabird May Thwart. -
Logging in Northwest

Fish and Wildlife biologist based in.
Portland.

Thousands of Pairs Remain

The Audubon Society believes that
the bird could eventually become ex-
tinct if logging of the old-growth for—
est continues.

According to biologists’ estimates,
only 3,400 breeding pairs of marbled
murrelets remain in Washington
state, maybe 2,400 breeding pairs in
Oregon and less than 1,000 in North-
ern California. '

Estimates for Alaska range up to
50,000 breeding pairs, and the bird is
found in Western Canada.

Jim Pissot, an Audubon Society
specialist, said that since the turn of
the century people have been trying
to discover Where the marbled mur-
relet. nests.

“Now we know or think we know:
150 feet up on the thick branches of

'old-growth trees,” he said. “They are

very dependent on old growth.”
Environmentalists believe that

more than 160 species may be'de—

pendent for survival on old-growth

. forests. '

The Forest Service has estimated
that about 7.5 million acres of old
growth remains in the Northwest,
with more than 80 percent of it on na-
tional forest lands.

Plans Call for Cutting Timber

Plans call for cutting about half of
that total over the next 50 years. For-
est Service officials have warned that
unless it is cut, the region’s timber in-
dustry could collapse.

Environmentalists say the Forest
Service estimates are grossly in-
flated and even include trees that
were destroyed by the 1980 eruption
of the Mount St. Helens volcano.

They also say that the old growth is
being cut at the rate of more than 170
acres a day - the equivalent of
roughly 129 football fields.

Congress asked the Forest Service
to survey the remaining old growth
and to come up with a common defini-
tion for an ancient tree. A Forest
Service task force earlier defined old—
growth trees as being at least 200
years old and almost three feet in
diameter.

Environmentalists say that defini-
tion is too narrow and that officials
also should take into account how
many of the trees are in a given area
and whether it has the characteris-
tics of a mature forest.

dogfighting

sent to Madison grand jury

 

By Sheilah O’Connor

Jackson, Tenn., Bureau

 

JACKSON, Tenn. — Three peo-
ple charged in connection with
a dog fight involving pit bulls
were ordered during a prelimi-
nary hearing Tuesday to appear
before a Madison County grand
jury Nov. 7.

The order came in the first
such case to ever reach a Mad-
ison County courtroom.

Charges were dropped against
three others accused of being
spectators as two dogs fought in
a back-yard pen just east of J ack-
son last August.

Madison County General Ses-
sions Court Special Judge Rus-
sell Larson made his ruling after
listening to 1 1/2 hours of testimo-

ny by a police investigator who

discovered two bloodied dogs
fighting Aug. 29 behind a trailer
owned by Kenneth Davis.

Local humane society workers

hope the state’s case against Da-
vis, 27, and 23—year—old Steve

Hairell -— ‘both of whom are‘

charged with a felony offense of
fighting animals — will frighten
off other dog fighters operating
in barns and along back roads in
West Tennessee. There are at
least a dozen dog-fighting rings
operating in Madison County,
according to Cindy Priddy, di-
rector of the Jackson-Madison
County Humane Society.

Betting is common during pit
bulldog fights, where the ani-
mals are usually trained to fight
until they can no longer move,
Ms. Priddy said.

Hairell, Davis and Gregory
Green, 27, accused of being a
spectator, were standing almost
directly over the dogs as the
dogs fought “almost muzzle to
muzzle” in the rectangular pen,
said the investigator, Sgt. Rocky
Acuff of the Jackson Police De-
partment. Green was bound
over to the grand jury along

with Hairell and Davis. James
Roberts, 24, Kathy Phillips, 23,
and Nicky Flowers, 26 — each of
whom was charged with being a
spectator —— were standing out-
side the pen when the officers
arrived, Acuff said. Charges
were dismissed against them.

Since the arrests, the Jackson-
Madison County Humane So-
ciety has been under a court or-
der to care for the two dogs bat-
tered in the fight, as well as two
other adult pit bulls and six pit
bull dog puppies taken from Da-
vis’ yard.

But the cost of feeding and car-
ing for the dogs and the incon-
venience of having to keep them
separate from the shelter’s 80
other homeless dogs presents a
burden for shelter workers, Ms.
Priddy said.

Ivy Scarborough, a Jackson
lawyer who represents the
shelter, plans to ask the court to
absolve the society’s responsibil-
ity for the pit bulls.

 

 

 

MEMPHIS CONNERCIAL APPEAL - October 25, 1988

9 Walking horse rules changed

New regulations close loophole

WASHINGTON (AP) — New in-
terim rules restricting the use of
pads and other devices to train
Tennessee walking horses and
other gaited horses will take ef-
fect immediately to close a loop-
hole in previously issued regula-
tions, the Agriculture Depart-
ment announced Monday.

James W. Glosser, administra-
tor of the department’s Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Ser-
vice, said the new rules will con-
tinue the present ban on the use
of heel pads of more than one
inch in yearling horses.

In a previous interim rule an-

nounced on July 26, the agency
eliminated federal regulations
that phased down the maximum
pad height to one inch. In place
of that, the agency ruled'that
pad height would be based on
the length of a horse’s foot.

Glosser said that under the
July provisions the pad height
on some horses may exceed one
inch, and that could be harmful
to yearlings. He said the agency
“inadvertently retained lan-
guage from the earlier rule that
would have ended the limitation
on pad height for yearling
horses after Oct. 31.”

, Therefore,

He said a limit on the height of
heel pads used on yearlings “is
necessary because the immature
development of the young
horses’ limbs makes higher pads
potentially harmful to them.” ,
Glosser said, the ':
agency was “removing the lan- ’
guage in the regulations that
would have terminated this re-
striction after Oct. 31.”

The agency administers the
Horse Protection Act of 1970,
which prohibits the practice of
“soring” horses by using cruel
methods, devices or chemicals
to cause them pain when walk-
ing. Soring is done primarily to
alter a horse’s gait.

HOT SPRINGS, S.D. — Born free,
then captured by lasso and caged in
pens, about 150 wild horses have been
released to gallop along the rocky
ridges and steep canyons of the Black
Hills, safe from the rope and the rifle.

This wild-horse sanctuary, an
8,300-acre range at Hell’s Canyon
about 10 miles southwest of Hot
Springs, was dedicated Oct. 5 as the
first such preserve sponsored by the
Bureau of Land Management.
- The horses, which had been held in
pens, in some cases for years, had
been passed over in a federal adoption
program chiefly because they were too
Old to be tamed. .
“This is essentially an old-age home
for wild horses," said Donald H.
Heinze, wild-horse specialist for the
bureau. “They can roam freely here
and live out the rest oftheir lives."

sanctuary, said, “It wasn‘t fair to“

.“These wild horses, they’d rather
die than let you groom them,” Hyde,

a rancher and environmental writer,

said.

The sanctuary grew out of a
government plan to reduce what it
considers a surplus of wild horses on
public land in the West. Cattle
ranchers contend the mustangs are
overgrazing these public lands and
depleting food for livestock.

About 43,000 wild horses roam the
West, a number the bureau hopes to
cut to about 31,000 through adoptions
and resettlement in sanctuaries.

About 7,000 wild horses are being
held in a feed lot in Bloomﬁeld, Neb,
under conditions that animal-rights
groups have condemned as deplorable.

It. is some of these horses that the
bureau intends to release on private
lands, such as Hyde’s range, a former
ranch purchased by his non-profit
foundation, the Institute of Range and
American Mustang.

carcasses of wild horses have been

managed wild-horse ranges. The bu-

fSlaughter of Wild Horses
Draws Outrage in Nevada

By ROBERT A. JONES, Times Staff Writer

‘ AUSTIN, Nev—Far back into
an empty mountain range in cen-
tral Nevada, the horse carcasses
are scattered along a wash. A small
herd of wild mustangs had come
here, in the heat of the summer, to
catch a drink at a small spring. As
they came near the water, or as
they left, someone began to shoot.
At the sound of the first shot,
almost certainly, the horses
spooked and ran. But the shooters
were ready for this, and one by one
they picked off the herd. In all
about 15 horses were killed here,
their decaying bodies now marking
the line of their attempted retreat.
The wash and its spring, many
miles from the nearest paved road,
are so little visited by humans that

they have no name. Jimmy Wil- .

,liams, a local rancher, has lived his

entire life in this region of sage-
covered mountains and never vis-
ited the wash until he heard of the

killings. Last week he came to take '
a look, and his first thought was "

how good a spot the killers had
picked.

“They thought no one would
come by this place for years,"
Williams said. “By that time the

horses Would just be a pile of old .
bones, something to kick your boot 3

at.”
But someone did see them. In

late August a helicopter pilot was

flying over these slopes when he
saw the sprawled bodies, and then
noticed even more in other washes.
He called the US. Bureau of Land

Management, which has jurisdic-i

tion over the region. and 800“ Wei?

- investigators had found. 41 dead
horses in the area.
'3 :.A month later the BLM found
153 more near Mt. Moses, a few
miles to the northwest. And in
early October they discovered 257
more on another range near Bald
Mountain. By this week the total
had grown to 451 dead horses,
scattered over 160 square miles of
desert, and the BLM said evidence
indicated that virtually all had

been shot. Some were freshly dead; ‘

others had been killed as long as
two years ago.

Thus far the BLM has made no
arrests in the case and has revealed
little about the ongoing investiga—

tion. An agency spokesman said

aerial shootings from helicopters or
military planes have been ruled out
and described the ammunition used
as civilian, not military. Otherwise,
law enforcement officials have de-

clined to discuss the case, refusing '_

even to disclose the number of
agents working on the killings.

?"7“We don’t want the killers to
know how many of our people are
out there looking for them. We
figure that to be an advantage for
us,” said Robert Steele, deputy
state director. ‘

Residents Outraged

Nonetheless, the case has gener-
ated outrage in Nevada, a state
whose residents are normally dedi-
cated to the rights of hunters and
other gun users. Gov. Richard
Bryan, in the midst of a campaign
for the US. Senate, spent a day
touring the area of the killings by
helicopter and returned to say the
shootings were “the product of a
sick mind." Several groups, includ-
ing the BLM, have offered rewards
totaling $17,000 for information
leading to conviction of the killers.

Ugly incidents involving wild

horses are not new in Nevada or
other Western states. Regularly
there have been isolated shootings
and even cases involving the
maiming of mustangs. But nothing
has approached the scale of these
killings. Theihorror of the deaths,
and the absence of arrests, has
provoked a number of theories
about possible perpetrators and
their motives.

The BLM says it has received a
number of calls pointing the finger
at extraterrestrials, and some oth-
ers have suggested that the mili-
tary might be using the horses for
target practice. The sheer volume
of calls about the military prompt-
ed the BLM to release its conclu-
sions ruling out aerial shootings or
the use of military ordnance.

After his helicopter tour, Gov.
Bryan added speculation of his
own, suggesting that the perpetra-
tor might be “some deranged per-
son who just thinks it is a great
sport to go out there and shoot and
kill something." '

But several state and federal
officials involved in wild horse
management say the pattern of the
killings and the large number of

deaths suggest another explana-
' tion. The horses most likely were
the victims of a range war, they
say, that has, pitted the mustangs
against large ranchers who raise
cattle and sheep on the same public
lands.

“The cattlemen hate the horses,
and they believe the BLM is not
domg enough to keep the horse

é population down,” said Terri Jay.
; executive director of Nevada’s
; Commission for the Preservation of
s the Wild Horse. “They think the
horses are stealing forage that
,_ 7 rightfully belongs to them.”
_ Until the early 19705, ranchers
could easily control the number of
. horses on federal lands by applying
for a local permit to “take” (shoot)

: a given number of animals. Such

“takings” were regular occurrenc-
es, and the population of wild
horses in Western states had fallen
from 2 million in the 19th Century
to 17,000 in 1971. ‘

Those days passed forever when
Congress, late that year, enacted
the Wild Free-Roaming Horse and
Burro Act. The law made it a
federal crime to kill a wild horse
and instructed the BLM to provide
for the welfare of the remaining
herds. ‘ y

The agency now spends $14
million a year on various wild horse
efforts, including its famous adopt—
a-horse program. The national
pOpulation of wild horses has
grown to 38,000, with 27,000 in
Nevada alone. But after 17 years
the BLM is still grappling for ways
to reconcile the wild horse with
those who see it as an interloper.

New BLM Program

Milt Frei, chief of wild horse
management for the agency. said

i' “the shootings have come just as the

BLM is about to embark on a new
initiative to balance the interests of
the wild horse against the livestock
herds. Recent studies have shown
that much of the BLM's land in
Nevada is overgrazed, he said, and
the agency has begun a reappraisal
of just how many animals will be
allowed to forage on federal land.
At present about 600,000 live-
stock animals graze on BLM lands
in Nevada, and Frei estimated that
ranchers could’be asked to reduce
their herds by as much as 20% to

' 40%.

It does not take extreme intelli-
gence, Frei said, to realize that
fewer horses will translate into
more forage for cattle and sheep.
Emphasizing that he was not ac-
cusing the ranchers of committing
the shootings, Frei said, “Some
people [ranchers] may have seen a
problem coming and decided to
make adjustments on their own.”

Deloyd Satterthwaite, president
of the Nevada Cattlemen‘s Assn,
confirmed that the horses have

 




?..

caused bitterness on the part of
some ranchers.

“They are very disturbed that
the BLM cannot seem to do what
Congress told it to do, which is
manage the numbers of wild hors;
es,’ Satterthwaite said. “When
there’s not enough forage ‘0 go
around, it’s always the livestock
that gets cut."

Nonetheless, Satterthwaite said,
he cannot believe that ranchers
committed the mass killings.

“The livestock people are the
first ones that people think of.
What they don’t realize is how
much a rancher has to lose,” he
said. “You stand to lose good
standing with the BLM, and with
that goes your livelihood.”

In Austin, an old gold mining
town that has recently seen a
rebirth of activity, the debate also
continues about the identity of the
killers. Jimmy Williams, the local
rancher who also operates one of
the town’s several saloons, believes
the shootings are the culmination
of the long-simmering war be-

tween wild horses and the ranch- p

ers.

“The ranchers used to shoot just
a few at a time and nobody paid
much attention. The only differ-
ence now is, they got a :_ more
ambitious,” Williams said.

As to why the culmination came
now, Williams says he is not cer-
tain. “There’s been a number of
lawsuits and injunctions saying you
can’t do this and can’t do that with
the wild horses. It could be that
they [ranchers] got scared and
decided to make their move,” he
said.

The true extent of the horses’
threat to the cattle and sheep is

‘- difficult to gauge. In terms of sheer
numbers, the threat would appear
to be minimal. The 27,000 horses
are dwarfed by the livestock herds
of more than 500,000 on BLM lands.

And BLM experts say that horses.

largely forage in areas that are not
visited by cattle or sheep. Accord-
ing to the Wild Horse Commission,
horses consume about 0.5% of

, Nevada's forage.

; In some regions of the state horse

i erds may pose competition to cattle
or sheep, but BLM officials say the
ranchers' perceived threat is usu-
ally‘ more psychological than real.
In the ranchers’ View, the horse is a
creature imposed on them by Con-
gress.

possession or use of offset steel-jaw, leg-hold
traps in Nevada County. If it passes, it will be
the first such ban enacted by voters in
California, although the boards of supervisors
in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties have
banned the traps.

It is a deeply emotional issue both here, in
this rural Northern California county of
72.000, and across the nation.

The citizens group tried to get

proposal. “The board felt the traps
are the only effective way to

' area.”

the traps or when removing a pet
from a trap. _

one of 72 big cats Hedren keeps on her California preserve.

BOSTON GLOBE - October 18, 1988

Actress Tippi Hedren talks with tigress Natasha.

ions and tigers and birds —
Oh, my!

That paraphrased re—
frain from “The Wizard of
Oz” could be Tippi Hedren’s
theme song.

Hedren starred in Alfred
Hitchcock s 1963 classic

“The Birds,” as the stun-
' ning young San Francisco socialite whose arrival
in Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds sparks a
feathered frenzy. And for the past 17 years or so,
Hedren has been the doting matriarch of a huge,
well-fed pride of big cats, now numbering 72 —
lions, tigers, leopards, panthers, mountain lions
and various combinations, and two elephants for
good measure.

Her private lBO-acre preserve (manned by four

full- time employees) is tucked away at the foot of '

the stubble-faced San Gabriel Mountains in the
Santa Clarita Valley of California, outside the
town of Acton. You can’t miss the entrance to
“Shambala" (Sanskrit for “a meeting place for
peace and harmony”). There is a l2-foot-high pe-
rimeter game fence and a sign warning that “Tres-

passers may be eaten or stomped.” Head down the
dusty drive and you're on safari. Lion roars swell
the valley and echo off the mountains. Trumpeting
elephants join in the jam session. Shambala is a
lush oasis in the dry valley, with tireless, shoosh- 3
ing sprinklers keeping the transplanted jungle *

1., vegetation alive. Mixed groups of lions and tigers

live in large compounds, while climbing cats
(mountain lions and leopards) live in smaller,
roofed enclosures. A large‘ African house” stands
on the shore. if a pond.

old Hedren (she has a small, two-bedroom house on

the compound and a larger one closer to L. A.) ——‘ .

i» tions that would get you into trou-
l ble, but their instincts are in them
l forever. ’l‘hat’ 5 what I love about
them. They can be your dearest

- friend, but in a split second they

could do some very, very serious
damage. The thing that of course

. protects us is the knowledge and

. understanding of the basic char-
acteristics of each species, and
then you have to know the indi-
vidual personality traits of each
cat. The lion will tell you every-
thing. He’s very demonstrative —
about how he feels, what he's

“thinking, what. he's planning. Ti—
gers not so much, they're a little
more volatile. The leopard is very

fast. The jaguar is a deadly, deadly
animal. We found homes for the

' jaguars who used to live here.” He-
dren felt the jaguars were just too
unpredictable to work with.

Crazy and loving it

Some people might think an at-
traction to such dangerous ani-
mals is crazy.

“Yes, I’m crazy and obsessed

and loving it,” Hedren says.
* Hedren caught cat fever during
. a trip to Africa. She and her then

husband, Noel Marshall, hatched
a scheme to make a movie star-

” ring big cats. Throughout the ear-

ly ’703 they recruited a cast of al-
most 100 big cats - taking many

’3 orphaned cubs into their home in
Sherman Oaks, Calif.

The film, ,‘Roar,” which has
yet to be released in the United
States. was made on the grounds
of Shambala, (purchased when

‘i"'the cats outgrew their suburban.
*3 surroundings) despite ﬂood, fire, ‘
3 injury and financial disasters.
‘ And some of the injuries were.
astounding. An assistant director
had three teeth knocked out. his'

left ear almost torn off and his
throat punctured by Tongaru — a
huge lion with a deservedly bad
reputation.

Hedren has had her share of
unpleasant experiences, including

‘ a confrontation with lioness Cher—

ries. During the filming of one
scene, Cherries took Hedren’s
head into her mouth. In Hedren’s

book. “The Cats of Shambala.”
she writes, “I could hear her teeth ,

scraping bone and the sound was
truly unforgettable.” Though the
bite caused a lot of bleeding, it
wasn’t serious. Hedren was given
a tetanus shot and some antibiot-
ics at a local hospital.

The lion was a scalper
But the most horrifying inci—
dent occurred when cinematogra-
pher Jan de Bont set up a scene in
which the cats were to leap over
him as he filmed from a tarp-cov-
ered pit. The crew wore football
helmets. However, after setting up
the scene, de Bont discovered the
helmet interfered with the eye-
piece on the camera, so he re-
moved it. Cherries had been
watching the movement under the
tarp. Hedren explains, “Like when
you’re in bed and the cat bites
your toes under the blanket.”
Only this wasn’t a little house cat
and it wasn’t toes she went after.
Cherries grabbed de Bont’s head
and ripped his scalp off in one
piece. "It s the most hideous thing
Ive ever been through,’ says He-
dren. One hundred and twenty
stitches were required to replace
his scalp.
“There isn’ t a time when l

‘ walk into a compound— and I nev-. .

er go in by myself, except for may-
be Natasha - that we aren’t al-
ways watching where the cats

re.’ Hedren says. “What’s the
look on their faces? What’s the
body posture? What’s the relation—
ship with the other animals?

What’s the relationship with us? .

Is there anything around they

could become possessive over? Al-

ways. You are always on alert. ”

Even love can be painful with 1‘
the big cats. Their rough tongues '

are designed to clean meat off
j3.bones So when Hedren holds her

‘ arm out for the tiger Natasha to
‘ lick or when Noelle, the tigon, in-

sists on sucking her thumb. skin
can become raw.
A eat of a different color

And Hedren says they do feel
something like love. “This would

3 be anthropomorphizing, but they
‘ have a general liking —- whether it

could be called love . . . I thinkmit

could. They have a capacity for re-
lationships I know they form very
firm bonds not only with each oth-
er but with us. And it’ 3 very evi-
dent with everyone at Shambala.”

Noelle, the tigon, is herself an
oddity on a very‘odd farm. Lions
and tigers are carefully placed to-
gether in big. open compounds on
Shamﬂbala And though it rarely
happens in the wild, even in the
one place in india where lions and
tigers live in proximity, at Sham- 3
bala a male tiger mated with a fe-
male lion. And 10 years ago,
Noelle, a “tigon," was born. She is
a big and beautiful honey- ~colored
cat with faint tiger stripes.

According to Hedren, tigers
and lions have very different vo-
calizations. Noelle speaks tiger
and lion. Even more amazing,
Noelle, thought to be sterile, mated
with a tiger and gave birth five
years ago to a “ti- -tigon,” — three-
fourths tiger, one fourth lion -
named Nathaniel. .

Hedren says that Noelle spoke
only “tiger" to her mostly tiger off-
spring. But though Noelle knew
how to handle the energetic cub,
the staff was puzzled by Nathan-
iel.

“We didn’t know who we were
dealing with,” Hedren says. “The
tiger in him or the lion. Noelle had
the best traits of both, but he was
showing the bad traits of the tiger.
So we brought him over to Boomer
[a lion]; well, Boomer knocked him
over and swore at him and taught
him that you can’t just do as you
please all the time. We sent him
back to Noelle when he was 10

, months old.”

For Hedren Shambala is more
than a hobby, it’s a cause. She
says she sees animals becoming
extinct through loss of habitat

and feels her preserve is impor-
tant.

‘Evcry dime goes to Shambala’
”Zoos can’t afford them. There
are hunts in Texas in which they'
use the cats for trophies. For
$10,000 or whatever, you can
shoot a lion who would walk right

 




up to you as a triend. it's appall-
ing. There are times when 1 really
don’t know how l’m going to pull
it through — and I‘m in one of
those positions right now -— I have
things that are being planned for
the future. but that doesn’t help
this week or next week."

Her pride eats 600 to 700
pounds of meat a day. And the ele-
phants -- Timbo and Kura - eat
500 pounds a day each. That’s
$1,500 a week just for food and
about $20,000 a month (including
maintenance) to run Shambala.

Considering that Hedren‘s last
smash hit movie was in 1964.
that’s a lot of money. “Every dime
I make goes to Shambala,” Hedren
says. And though Luis Barrene-
chea, her businessman husband
of 21/2 years, finds a $20,000—a-
month loss hardto fathom, he too
has made donations.

Hedren's daughter, actress Me-
lanie Griffith (“The Drowning
Pool,” “Body Double," ”Some-
thing Wild" and the soon~to—be-re—
leased ”Working Girl") also don-
ates money. But Hedren spends
most of her time fundraising for
her nonprofit agency. Roar. '

Hedren and her staff of four (it
used to be 17) and‘an army of vol-
unteers conduct fund—raising sa-
faris on the weekends. They print
a newsletter. get as much com-
mercial work for the animals as
possible and have set up a foster
care/adeption program in which
people can sponsor a big cat.

Still, every week is a struggle.
”They have such a hold on all of
us it’s impossible to explain it.”
Hedren says. “The sacrifices we
make here at Shambala are terrif-
ic, people can’t believe what we go
through.”

It is hard to understand until
you kneel beside Scarface the lion,
pet Natasha the tiger or listen to
mountain lion Amy purr. Then ev-
erything Hedren does makes abso-
lute sense.

0M”Pan’s: Delicacy

 

BY YASUH/KO SUZUKI

 

HALE farming?

’i “If Japan can’t

hunt whales,

~ then why not

grow ’em? I’m going to show

that whales can be raised, just

like sheep and cattle,” says vet-
erinarian Hisao Izawa.

Izawa, 55, teaches in the Depart
ment of Veterinary Medicine at Hok-
kaido University in Sapporo. As the
first step in his research, heis raising
porpoises in tanks.

“In 1986, I was in Tokyo for a meet-
ing of the Japan Veterinary Medicine
Association,” says Izawa, “and I went to
a whale-meat restaurant with several
colleagues. Somebody saidthat when
the ban on whaling goes into effect, we
wouldn’t be able to eat this delicacy
anymore.

“Then we started to talk about rais
ing whales. At first it was a joke, but
later I decided it might not be a bad
idea.”

The best place to raise whales, of
course, is theocean. The Fishery Agen-
cy is planning an ocean whale ranch at
its Far Seas Fisheries Research Labora~
tOry in Shimizu, Shizuoka prefecture.
But it's an iffy project, says Izawa.

“A ranch in the ocean will have to

be enclosed by an enormous fence. If a .

storm kicks up high waves, the whales

will jump the barrier and get away. '
Construction and operating costs

4 would be enormous.

“I believe we can adapt whales to
fresh water,” says Izawa. “That would ,

make ranches in lakes and reservoirs ;

feasible.”

l

SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - October 16, 1988

, To determine whether whales can

.- be raised in fresh water, Izawa built a

. circular, reinforced plastic pool, 19%

' feet in diameter and 5 feet deep, on a
vacant campus lot. Three five-foot-long
porpoises were placed in the pool in
July. It was filled with sea water for
the first 10 days, and then the salt
content of the water was gradually
lowered. ‘

The experiment has two major ob
jectives, according to Izawa. First, to
test the effects of fresh water on the
animals’ kidneys. Accustomed to
heavy salt water, the organs may mal-
function. Second, to study the effect of

'fresh water on a porpoise’s skin. Be-
cause of the difference in osmotic pres-
sure, ocean fish die soon after being
placed in fresh water. Porpoises are
mammals, however, and because their
skin is similar to human skin, they
should be able to tolerate fresh water.
But rapid elimination of salt from the
water may cause mold and other mi-
croorganisms to form on the skin.

Within a month, the pool was half
seawater and half fresh. Blood-pres-
sure tests and electrocardiograms
showed the porpoises to be healthy. In
late August, they lived for a few days
in fresh water but lost their appetite
and deveIOped skin abnormalities. Re
searchers added salt water, and in
mid-September moved the porpoises to
a pond with a 1 percent to 2 percent
saline content.

: Despite limited research funds, Iza- *
[we is optimistic: “We’ll experiment

'. with porpoises for two more years and
then move into the next phase: accli-
. matizing whales to fresh water.

“We want to start raising minke ‘,

' whales; they’re small and the meat is

' delicious. There won’t be enough room
on campus. We’ll probably use a lake in
Hokkaido. ‘ -

“The whale has a common ances-
tor with cattle -— ungulates, a species
of mammals that had hoofs and lived
on land,” says Izawa. “The kidneys and

stomach of a cow and whale are ana-
tomically very similar. That increases
the probability that whales can be do-
mesticat'ed.”

In the future, scientists may solve
feeding and reproduction problems
through biotechnology and create a

f resh-water species of whale. Some ex. >

perts are skeptical, however. Hidehit‘o
Kato, senior fellow of the Institute of
Cetacean Research, says, “Almost

nothing is known about the‘eco‘logy of j

the minke, one of the deep-ocean She: . . ,
critics that they don’t know wha

cies. Researchers will run-into many
problems. Porpoises eatsmall fish, but
the minké’s main diet is animal plank-
ton. I don’t know how the Hokkaido

: i group will provide that in fresh wa-

ter.”

Seiji Ohsumi, a marine biologist at
the Far Seas Fisheries Research Labo-
ratory, is also doubtful. “Why raise
whales inland, in lakes, when Japan
has so little space to begin with? It’s a
perversion of nature.”

Munesato Yamada, professor

‘ emeritus at Kanazawa ‘University’s
medical school and a renowned au-

thority on whales, says, “It’s taken the

. changef’

W W3 iii :-

whale’ millions of years to adapt to ‘
aquatic life. I wonder if it can with-
stand a sudden environmental

“During World War II, when there
was a terrible food shortage, whale
meat was an invaluable source of 'pro-
tein,” says Yamada. "But Japan today
is a gourmet’s paradise. There’s plenty.
of good food without growing whales.”

‘ Izawa’s project has raised hackles

in the anti-whaling oamp. Opponents
call his research “the equivalent of

whaling” and demand that he stOp.

Izawa ignores the criticism.

“The anti-whaling people are arro-
gant and self-rightems. Hindus regard _
cattle as sacred, but they don’t tell
Europeans and Americans not to eat
beef. Domesticating the whale will

'save it from extinction, which is what

these peOple are always yelling about.” -

About 30 similarminded research- ‘
ers throughout Japan are involved in
the project. Masahito Akutsu, 60, a vet- .

'erinarian from Ashiyoro, Hokkaido,

says, “Whaling and eating whale meat

' is a'tradithon, part of our culture. As a

Christian, I see nothing brutal about
whaling. Our research will show the

they’re talking about.” ' . -

* If Izawa and his colleagues cannot
find a reservoir or the like for a whale
farm, they might try an unused dry-
dock. Several are available because of
a prolonged recession in the ship-build—
ing industry.

“A brackish lake like Lake Saroma
might even be better because of its mix

'of fresh. and salt water,” says Izawa. _

Located in northeastern Hokkaido, the ',
huge lake is separated from the ocean ,
by a sarier and is home to scallops,
oysters and flatfish. ~

CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR - October 25, 1988

Whale of a re so i e

Canadian animal expert frees whales trapped in ﬁshing nets off the coast ,

By David R. Francis
Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
St. John’s, Newfoundland
ON LIEN moved his index ﬁnger up and
down, showing how he controls a 40-ton
whale with a small rope.
Another ﬁshing story?
No, says the animal behaviorist. “That is
literally true.”

.In the past 10 years, Mr. Lien has rescued hun-
dreds of Whales from the nets of Newfoundland
ﬁshermen in a program designed to save both expen-
sive ﬁshing equipment and the lives of marine
mammals. He’s learned how to calm and manage the
whales as he untangles them from the lines. While
ﬁguring out how the animal is caught, he may shift
the whale by tugging slightly on the entangling
ropes, something the whale feels.

, When ﬁrst trapped, a whale, will struggle hard to
free itself, possibly injuring itself on the poly-
propylene rope or other strong materials used in
modern ﬁshing gear. Once it ﬁnds it cannot escape,
the animal becomes still on the water’s surface.

“Humpbacks are sort of Sissies,” he says. “They
don’t do things to hurt themselves. Most smart ani-
mals learn to minimize pain and punishment. You get
control of the animal. You can move him this way or
that way. It is only because of their size that it seems
impossible.” ~

 

Most humpback: cooperate

Last summer Lien got his ﬁrst dunking in the cold
ocean by an agitated humpback. The ﬁshing equip—
ment was wrapped around its tail. As Lien attempted
to untangle the mess, he and his rubber boat went
ﬂying into the air when the whale ﬂipped its ﬂuke.

A ﬁsherman captured the episode with a video
camera. With only his dignity hurt, Lien towed the
heavy beast to the rocky beach where it could not
move its tail, removed the netting, and pushed the
whale back out to sea. It swam away.

But normally this psychologist, from Memorial
University of Newfoundland, ﬁnds that the hump—
backs remain quiet while he works to release them.
Indeed, he usually parks his outboard-powered boat
on the back of a creature as he tries to ﬁgure out how
it is caught. Sometimes the netting runs through an
animal’s mouth, like a bridle. Or the whale may have
gotten its long side ﬁns or tail entangled.

Lien circles the creature for as much as an hour to
get it used to the presence of the rubber boat and its

occupants. Then he puts down an anchor and brings .

the boat up to the whale, ready to haul away should
the animal ‘signal by cocking its tail or arching its
back that it is going to thrash about or dive.

If the tail is caught and the whale refuses to bring

it to the surface for untangling, Lien will sometimes ;

use a sharp hook on a pole, much like a mahout
handles an elephant, to get its tail up. The release can
takenas little as 15 minutes.

’1. s.‘.‘“.-.~,,

of Newfoundland

Some observers of a whale rescue have speculated
that the creature knows it is being helped. As an
animal behaviorist, Lien is not so sure. But he does
say of an untangling, “We cooperate with them as
much as they cooperate with us.” The whale usually
allows Lien and the ﬁsherman, if necessary, to put

. their feet on its back while they. pull the net free.

Sharks less easy to control

In contrast, basking sharks, which are not so
intelligent, cannot be controlled when they get
caught in nets and traps. So these 25-foot-long ﬁsh
are generally killed and their meat is sold by the
ﬁshermen. Their ﬁns are sold in the Orient to make
shark’s ﬁn soup. Their livers, Which can weigh a ton,
are shipped to Norway for extraction of oil that has a
number of industrial uses. The ﬁsherman can earn
more than $1,000 for his effort, a sum that can more
than offset damage to his nets.

’ Last summer one ﬁsherman marked both his
birthday and 25th wedding anniversary by releasing
alive one of these huge but harmless creatures. Lien
persuaded him to tag it ﬁrst.

“Few inshore ﬁshermen can afford such costly
celebrations too often,” notes Lien, referring to the

-. fact that Newfoundland’s 26,000 inshore ﬁshermen

1 have a meager cash income of $6,000 to $9,000 a

g, year (Canadian; US$4,800 to $7,200).

Lien calls himself a “biological arbitrator.” He
mediates between one species, the ﬁshermen, and the

whales, sharks, seals, dolphins, and oceangoing tur-

. tles that blunder into anchored nets and traps set up
along some 1,000 miles of Newfoundland shoreline to
catch cod, salmon, and other ﬁsh.

Plankton, ﬁsh, whales, and ﬁshermen all concen-
trate in the same biologically'rich patches of ocean,
says Lien. “There is a built-in conﬂict.”

From a ﬁsherman’s standpoint, the entrapped
whale is a “marine rat,” as Lien puts it - both
potentially dangerous and a threat to his livelihood
in an all-too-short summer season. Humpbacks are
responsible for 70 to 90 percent of the damage done

‘ to the gear of inshore ﬁshermen.

The ﬁrst ofﬁcial ban on hunting humpback
whales was passed in 1963 by the International
Whaling Commission. Since then, experts estimate
the whale population-Bathe northwest Atlantic to be
about 4,000 to 63303— neariy quadrupled since the

- =-tian'..This leads some experts to be-
' ‘ lieve that the classiﬁca- ‘

tion of “endangered

species” should

 




g be diminished to “threatened.”

t The ﬁshermen, through the educational eﬁ'orts of

“ the bearded professor. have learned that alive whale
is better than a dead ’Wi’iaie. it can generally be
, removed from the net with less trouble than one that
has been killed. If dead, the whale may sink along
With the ﬁshing equipment and rise to the surface
again only after a week or longer. The ﬁsherman
loses valuable ﬁshing time and may still need to
dispose of the huge body.

Lien got into the whale-rescue business a decade
ago when he received a phone call about a live
humpback that had been tangled in a net for three
months. He soon learned that both damage to gear
‘i‘and Whale mortality were increasing dramatically.
Humpbacks had apparently moved inshore to feed
on schools of capelin when ﬁshermen depleted the
stock of these small ﬁsh offshore. The number of
ﬁshermen had also increased, and they were using
tougher gear more likely to entrap whales.

Rescue efforts successful

'Ibday, the mortality rate for caught whales has
declined from about 50 percent when Lien started to
7 percent last year, or three of the 44 humpbacks
entrapped in groundﬁsh gill nets, cod traps, salmon
gill nets, or lobster pot lines.

Each time Lien heads for the site of a whale
entrapment, he feels a “healthy respect” for the

- power of the creature, wondering if he will succeed
in freeing it safely. Over the summer he was so busy
rescuing whales that he had about four days a month
to be with his family.

This year he got extra funds from the federal and
provmcial ﬁsheries departments to hire two ﬁsher-
men to take on the actual rescue jobs. So far they
havebeen called to the rescue of 55 humpbacks and
12 minke whales (these smaller creatures more often
drown when entrapped). The university pays Lien’s
salary as its contribution to his Newfoundland Insti-
tute for Cold Ocean Science. .

“This is the ﬁrst summer I haven’t been entrapped
myself,” he says. i
. Instead of rescuing Newfoundland whales, he has

Just ﬂown to Australia to show ﬁsheries people there
: how . to deal with entrapped whales in the Great
Bamer Reef area. He has helped with the same
problem in Alaska, British Columbia, and California.
In California, some conservationists pushed for a
ban on ﬁshing as a way of saving whales from
entrapment. The ﬁshermen responded with bumper
stickers that read, “Jesus was a gill netter.”
‘_ Actually, Lien notes, Jesus was a purse seiner.
Lien was pleased to see the ﬁshermen ﬁght-
‘ mg back against conservation extrem-
. ists. He believes it’s vital for conser~
’ ~.vationists to work with ﬁshermen,
,not against them.
“ “Compromise is good for
everyone,” he concludes.

kind neighbor was able to get one

We have no idea where she is and
we are just sick. We do not let our

In the meantime, could she be
the victim of the police? We under-

anyone, and we can only hope the 7
police think about that possibility
- before shooting at whim.
We are offering a reward for her

Apes’ Romance
Gets Rocky Start
At Florida Z00

By Tom Uhlenbrock
Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

With firefighters, surgeons
and veterinarians armed with
tranquilizer guns standing by,
the long-awaited rendezvous be-
tween Colossus and Muke was
pulled off in a Florida zoo.

Pat Quinn, director of the
Gulf Breeze, Fla., Zoo, ex-
plained that Colossus, a silver»
back male who at 600 pounds is
believed to be the largest low
land gorilla in captivity, never
had been with a member of his
species. -

Zoo officials had no idea how
Colossus would react to Muke -—
who is from St. Louis —- because
he has been alone since he was
captured shortly after birth
some 20 years ago.

“We had the fire department
with high-pressure hoses to

knock them down with water if

they started fight-
ing,” he said. “We had trauma sur-
geons to sew them up if there was a
lot of biting. We had a veterinary
team with tranquilizer guns.”
Preparations for the big day actu-
ally began in June, when Muke, a
250-pound female with a reputation
for surliness, was sent on loan to Gulf

 

ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH - October 12, 1988

and poised hoses, sutures and dart
guns, the door was opened wide
enough to allow Muke to enter Colos-
sus’ bedroom Friday.

“She came out, and he made a
charge for her,” Quinn said. “There
was a grab and a roll and a tussle. He
ended up with a bite on his neck
about 6 inches long. She backhanded
him, and he slid in the grass and
turned ass-over-tea kettle, and all the
ladies cheered.

“She went back into her bedroom,
lay down and applauded herself. It
was gorgeous.”

Day 2 was more of the same. ,

“She came back out, he charged
and threatened, and she roared and
ran him all over the campground,”
Quinn said. “He ran back into her
bedroom, so it was a standoff.”

On Day 3, relations between the
two were a bit more cordial.
They wereﬂinteracting back and

Breeze from the St. Louis Zoo. She

was placed in a room with a view of
Colossus.
“About a month ago, we started

opening the doors so they could touch
each other,” Quinn said. “There was

some grabbing and some nipping and t; .:

tucking.”

E :: ..
With firefighters, surgeons and zoo
officials watching with bated breath

 

forth, sharing water at the pool,”
Quinn said. “Now, they’re sharing a
blanket we gave them.”

Zoo keepers had taught Colossus
some hand signals, and he used the
simple sign language in attempts to
communicate with Muke, Quinn said.

“He’s patting his chest,” he said.
“That means ‘give me,’ so maybe she
will.” .

Because both Colossus and Muke
are older gorillas with no previous
experience at mating —- Muke
seemed disinterested in previous
pairings —— zoo officials are pessimis-
tic that their relationship will have
reproductive results.

But they note that lowland gorillas
are an endangered species and that
Colossus represents an untapped res-

ervoir of genes that could be used in -

captive breeding programs if he can
be socialized successfully.

The m eting'aiso represents an

ideal chance for psychologists to
study the effects of prolonged isola-
tion. Researchers from the Universi-
ty of West Florida prepared Colossus
for the meeting by showing him Na-
tional Geographic movies of other go-
rillas. They also have recorded his
every reaction to Muke.

“We have 60 hours of video tape;

all this is going into a computer,”

Quinn said. “We want to see how
these intelligent social animals be-
have after all these years of isolation.

“Apparently, it’s going very well.

Colossus is not a neurotic animal.
He’s not trying to kill her, just setting .

up normal dominance the way male
gorillas are supposed to do.

“But she’s been a" tough gorilla. In .

fact, he’s come out on the worst end

of the stick here so far in this,
introduction.” . . . .'

an Francisco’s first
menagerie, a fax

shriek, h00t, howl,

growl or yodel from
today’s distinguished institu-
tion at Sloat Boulevard and
the Pacific Ocean, was a din-
gy basement at Clay and
Leidesdorf streets in 1856, op-
erated by James C. (Grizzly
Adams. ' '

Those distinguished native Cali-
fornians, Ursis Horribz'lz’s C., were
the main attraction. As historian
Theodore Hittell described the pio-
neer zoo: “In the middle, chained. to
the floor, were two large grizzly
bears, which proved to be Benjamin
Franklin and Lady Washington.
They were pacing restlessly in cir-
cles some-10 feet in diameter, their
chains being about five feet long,
and occasionally rearing up, rattling
their irons and reversing their di-
rection.

. . At the rear, in a very large
iron cage, was the monster grizzly,
Samson. He was an immense crea-
ture weighing some three-quarters
of a ton, and from his look and ac-
tions, as well as from the care taken
to rail him off from spectators, it
was evident that he was not to b
approached too closely.” “ '

By 1889, when Monarch, another
huge grizzly, was exhibited here at
Woodward's Gardens and later in
Golden Gate Park, grizzlies were
growing rarer. The first animal in
the San Francisco Zoological collec-
tion, Monarch survived until 1911.
Thousands of people went to the
Golden Gate Park lily pond to gaze
on him‘ in wonder. Now stuffed, he
is now in the park’s Academy of
Science, in the new “Wild Califor-
nia” exhibit. ‘

There are now a half—dozen oth-
er kinds of bears at the San Francis-
co Zoo (none of them chained), but
you won’t see a California grizzly.
The last documented grizzly bear
was shot by a rancher in 1922 at
Horse Corral Meadow in Fresno
County.

Rockdale Animal Shelter Facing Auction BlOcl’

By Anne Cowles
Staﬂ Witter

In 11 days. .two men Who hold a
$19,695.78 mortgage for pet food
might succeed where the courts.
the state of Georgia and Rockdale
County residents have failed for 10
years — they could put an end to
Life For God’s Stray Animals.

The properties of the contro-
versial no-kill animal shelter will
go on the auction block Nov. 1, un-
less shelter owners come up with
the money to clear that debt.
which is one of six property mort-
gages held by creditors.

.. Faced with unpaid bills for pet
food, gas, fencing andfattorney’s

fees, shelter owners Ann and Jerry
Fields in May 1986 transferred
property titles to creditors to buy
time to pay off the debts.

Although all but one of the
mortgages are now in default. the
foreclosure proceeding involves
only the fifth mortgage —- to Nutri»
tional Pet Foods. Inc. in Marietta.
That mortgage was purchased by
Alton Housworth Jr. and Clarence
Hall. The two also hold the. first
mortgage for a shelter prt‘rpt‘rty on
Miller Bottom Road that was pur-
chased after a site on Farmer
Road was ordered closed.

“If all goes as. planned. there
will be a foreclosure sale on Nov. 1
by public auction." said Michael

Terrell. attorney for Mr. Hous»
worth and Mr. Hall in‘the foreclo—
sure proceedings.
. Mr. Housworth is a real estate
’ broker and developer and Mr. Hall
is a real estate developer. accord-
ing to Mr. Terrell.
, Abe Sharony. attorney for the
Fieldses. said Life for God‘s Stray
Animals is appealing to supporters
to raise money to cover the debt.
“ I feel very strongly like this is

a rather unscrupulous thing for
these fellows to be doing, to take
advantage of the shelter’s misfor-
tune.” said Mr. Sharony. '

' Mr. Sharony holds the second

mortgage on the shelter properties
in the amount of $27,809.99 for at—
torney‘s fees.

Mr. Terrell said the two men
“are not doing anything that any
other creditor would not do when a
deed to secure debt is in default.
They’re simply exercising their
rights.”

The first mortgage, for $135,000,
is held by Mr. Housworth and Mr.
Hall on the original sale of the Mill—
er Bottom Road property to the
Fieldses. Both shelter sites were
used as collateral for the five other
mortgages.

Mr. Houseworth and Mr. Hall
also have purchased the third mort-
gage for 822992.11 from a law part-
nership where Mr. Sharony previ-
ously worked, and the fourth
mortgage of $11,074.83 from Gas, In-
corporated. The sixth mortgage 18 in
the name of Lewis Brown for
$70000.

The threat of foreclosure is the
latest development in legal and fi~
nancial problems that in recent
years have plagued Life For God’s
Stray».~ Animals. which provides per-
manent. care. for sick and unwanted
animals.

Mr. and Mrs Fields have been
fugitives on civil contempt of court.
charges since July 1986 for failing to
complete a court-ordered transfer
of some 1,100 animals from the first
site on Farmer Road to the shelter ,
on Miller Bottom Road. About 1.000 I

_ animals remain at the two shelters. -*

Shelter properties will go on the auction-block

Residents near both sites have com-
plained of noise and odors.

Both shelters have been
deemed a nuisance and ordered
closed by Rockdale County Superior
Court Judge Clarence Vaughn —- the
one on Farmer Road in 1984 and
the Miller Bottom site in 1987. The
US. Supreme Court declined to
hear appeals of the lower court rul-
ings on both properties.

As a result, the Fieldses now
face additional contempt charges
for failing toabide by the court or-

der to close down the Miller Both-an
Road shelter. A contempt hearing 2--

scheduled next month in Rockdalc
Superior Court, according to John
Walton Henderson. attorney for
Miller Bottom Road residents op-
posing the shelter.

second through sixth deeds to se-
cure debt were l‘iled May 1, 1986 by
Mr. Sharony. Although the Fieldses
have paid on the first mortgage
held by Mr. Housworth and Mr.
Hall, they are “chronically late,”
Mr. Terrell said.

Mr. Housworth and Mr. Hall are
hunting in Canada until the end of
the month, and could not be
reached for comment.

The Associated Press

GULF BREEZE -—— As the punch-
line goes, a 60,,0-pound gorilla can

do anything he wants. But keepers '

at The Zoo must have forgotten'to
tell that one to Muke, a female go-

rilla on loan for a breeding project .

with Colossus, thought to be the
largest gorilla in captivity.

Colossus, who has lived at the
Panhandle zoo since June, and
Muke, (pronounced moo-key) who
has lived here since March, got
their first look at each other on Fri-
day, and it was anything but love at
first sight.

Colossus charged and flipped lit-
erally head over heels in an appar-
ent attempt to injure Muke. He
came away with a mouthful of fur,
but Muke left Colossus with a 5-

‘ inch gash in his neck.

“I feel very positive. He made a charge at
her, but he hasn’t continued his aggressive
behavior. We’re just going to let them do
their own thing now, but they will have more
confrontations.”
~— Zoo Director Pat Quinn

The purpose of the visit was to
“socialize” Colossus, said Pat
‘Quinn, the 200’s president and di-
rector.

“That was a good introduction,”
Quinn said. “It was the first time he
has touched another gorilla since
he was an infant over 20 years
ago.”

Both gorillas are 22 years old.
Colossus stands 6 feet, 2 inches.
Muke, weighing at least 250
pounds, is thought to be one of the

larger female gorillas in captivity.

Zoo officials, concerned about in-
jury during the blind date, had
trauma surgeons and firefighters
with water hoses in case the two he-

eame entangled in a serious figziht.

“I feel very positive,” Quinn
said. “He made a charge at her, but
he hasn’t continued his aggressive
behavior. We’re just going to let
them do their own thing now, but
they will have more confronta-
tions.”

By Friday afternoon, Muke had
figured out how to handle herself

and was stalking Colossus around ,

the play yard.

“She’s pretty much figured out'

what the score is,” Quinn said.
“They’re going back and forth at
each other. They’re getting closer.
. . . It’s working out great.” ’

Officials hope the breeding pro—
ject will shed new light on how go-
rillas mate in captivity.

The two goriilas will live in a
new complex that includes air con-
ditioning, sleeping quarters, an ob
servation area and the play yard.

Colossus was captured as an in—
fant in the western lowlands of
Central Africa in 1967. He came to
Florida from Benson’s Animal
Park in Hudson, NH. Muke is on
loan from the St. Louis Zoo.

Yerkes Scientist Establishes
First Sperm Bank for Chimps

By Hal Straus

Science/Medici:w \l’i‘itcr

A Yerkes Regional Primate Center sci-
entist has established the world’s first
sperm bank for chimpanzees and says he
has indisputable proof that it works -—— a fe-
male chimp named Alice who is three
months pregnant.

The new sperm bank will help scientists
preserve one of medicine’s most highly val-
ued research animals. Chimpanzees, man’s
closest biological relative, are a threatened
species that no longer can be legally cap-
tured in the wild.

The bank will help breeders maintain a
genetically diverse population of captive
chimps in the United States and give scien-
tists a model for devel0ping sperm banks
for other primates like gorillas, for exam-
ple, which are even closer than chimps to
extinction in the wild.

Dr. Kenneth G. Gould, who developed
the sperm bank, said that the bank is par—
ticularly important in light of increasing
demand for the animals by AIDS research-
ers.

Dr. Gould, chief of reproductive biology
at Yerkes, said that researchers at Yerkes
and other centers around the world infect
the animals with AIDS to study the prog-
ress of the disease in an animal with an im-
mune system similar to man’s.

Unlike man, the animals do not die of
AIDS, but they can spread the virus and

 

For more than three decades, sci-
entists have known how to freeze
human and cattle sperm success-
fully, but the formulas they used
didn’t prevent ice crystals from
destroying the chimpanzee sperm.

 

therefore are not allowed to breed after be-
ing infected.

“I’m glad to hear about his success,”
said Dr. Duane C. Kraemer, a specialist in
primate reproduction and a Texas A&M
University professor. “It’s important that
we develop techniques for sperm storage
and artificial insemination for a number of
species.”

For more than three decades, scientists
have known how to freeze human and cattle
sperm successfully, but the formulas they
used didn’t prevent ice crystals from de-
stroying the chimpanzee sperm.

Dr. Gould began trying to freeze chim-
panzee sperm in 1986, experimenting with
various mixtures and different freezing
rates in an attempt to prevent formation of
ice crystals.

“Basically, we had to proceed by trial
and error,” said Dr. Gould. ~

Eventually, he found that chimp sperm
had to be frozen more, slowly than other
species —- its temperature lowered from

room temperature to -110 degrees Fahren-
heit in about 60 minutes. To survive, the
Sperm also must be treated with an anti-
freeze called glycerol.

Experiments indicate that about 60 per-
cent of the spermatozoa survive, Dr. Gould
said. By comparison, cattle sperm banks
are able to achieve about a 70 percent re-
vival rate. -

At left, Dr. Kenneth G. Gould examines frozen chimpanzee sperm. Above are some
of the baby chimpanzees kept at the Yerkes Regional Primate Center.

Six Yerkes males have “donated”

sperm so far, and 10 females have each
been artificially inseminated one time with
previously frozen sperm, according to Dr.
Gould.

One of the females, Alice, is pregnant
and past the time period when spontaneous
abortions in chimps are common. A second
female may be pregnant.

“We feel pretty good about that rate,
particularly when you consider we only
made a single attempt to artiﬁcially insemi-
nate each female,” said Dr. Gould.

Dr. Gould plans to store sperm “donat~
ed” by the 78 chimps at Yerkes who have
not already given, and to collect it from
male chimps scheduled to be infected with
the AIDS virus.

"The Human Benefits "

of Animal Research

Curtailing the use of animals in hu-
man health care research could jeopar-
' dize the search for cures for Alzheimer’s
disease, diabetes, heart ailments and
acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome,
says a National Research Council com-
mittee, which estimates that animal-
based research has raised average life
expectancy at birth in the United States
by about 25 years since 1900. ,

“Animal experimentation is an es-
sential component of biomedical and

behavioral research, a critical part of '

efforts to prevent, cure and treat a vast

range of ailments,” concludes the panel
in a report released last month. The

. report, a three-year effort, was written

in response to mounting criticism by the
animal rights movement.

While the committee says that “the
chance that alternatives will completely
replace animals [for research] in the
foreseeable future is nil,” it does recom-
mend that research institutes consider

-' alternatives before using animals in ex—

periments and that federal regulatory
agencies move rapidly to accept tests
that reduce the number of animals used
“insofar as this does not compromise
the regulatory mission of an agency.”
The committee also urges Congress to
allocate roughly $ 10 million annually to
the Department of Agriculture for the

enforcement of existing laboratory ani-

mal regulations.

The report has generated contro-
versy within the committee and beyond.
Panel member Christine Stevens, pres—
ident of the Animal Welfare Institute,
questioned the assessment that animal
abuse in research was uncommon and
chose not to sign the report. Noting that
the report was funded by the National
Institutes of Health and 19 private in-
dustry corporations that use animals in
testing, Purple for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals. a leading animal rights
organization, calls the document “sci-
entiﬁcally ﬂawed, factually inaccurate.

' morally unenlightened, defensive and a

disservice to animals and people."

rizzly bears are protected wildlife.

$3,000 Fine for Killing
Grizzly Bear ls Upheld

Ranchers have no constitutional
right to kill grizzly bears to defend their
livestock, a federal appellate court has
ruled. upholding a 83.000 civil fine im-
posed on a Montana sheep rancher for
violating the Endangered Species Act.

Rancher Richard Christy lost 84 of
his 1.700 sheep to bears in two months
before he shot and killed a grizzly in
1982. Bears are under federal protec-
tion, so the Department of the Interior
levied a $3,000 ﬁne against him. He
and two other ranchers filed suit, chal-
len gin g the constitutionality of the law.

A US. District Court in Montana
upheld the law. The San Francisco-
based 9th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed, saying that there is no constitu-
tional right to protect one’s property.
“We do not minimize the seriousness of
the problem faced by livestock owners,”
wrote Judge Arthur L. Alarcon. “We
simply hold that the right to kill fed-
erally protected wildlife in defense of
property is not “implicit in the concept
of ordered liberty.’ "

Plorido Sued
Over Pollution
Of Everglades

Associated Press
Miami

The federal government
has sued Florida for allowing

water pollution" to endanger .

and possibly destroy federal
wildlife areas in the Everglades
and Lake Okeechobee.

The Everglades system “is an
international environmental trea-
sure," said US. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen. “The degradation over a
number of years is a tragedy. (The
wildlife areas) will be lost tofuture
generations.” '

The suit, filed on Wednesday, is
an attempt to force the state and the
water. district to end a nineyear
standoff with dairy farmers and
sugar-cane growers. Their agricul~
tural runoff is polluting rivers and
canals that feed the environmental-
ly sensitive Everglades, which cov-
ers much of South Florida.

3' Charges

The suit charges the state De ‘
partment of Environmental Regula- i

tion and the South Florida Water
Management District with allowing
the operation of pumps without a
permit, failing to maintain water
quality standards and violating con
tracts to supply clean water to Ever~
glades Maia, ail Park.

1 Treachobee, at 700
squat“... the nation’s largest
freshwater raise outside of the Great
Lakes, has for years been receiving
pollution.

 

Levels of phosphates and ni-

, trates as much as 120 times higher
than natural levels are pouring into
, the area, producing fish—killing al~
' gae blooms in the lake and changing

the face of Everglades National

Park, according to park Superinten.

dent Michael Finley.

"This action is a preemptive
strike -—- what we are talking about
without action is ecological col-
lapse,” Finley said. He described the
damage already done as “almost ir—
reparable."

Endangered species

 

The park provides sanctuary to
rare and endangered wildlife, such
as the Florida panther, Southern
bald eagle, woodstork, American
crocodile and Cape Sable sparrow.

Finley called the agricultural
pollutants slowly moving south

, through rivers and canals "a cancer .."

descending on the park" and the
adjoining Loxahatchee National

. Wildlife Refuge.

 

 

 

Animal Groups

OP DOGS in the animal rights busi-

ness have rallied around the Humane
Society of the United States since we
hinted at how much money there is to be
made in the top ranks of animal chari-
ties.

We reported that national Humane
Society President John Hoyt and Trea-
surer Paul Irwin were reaping far more
compensation for their work than even
theirown board members knew. Last
year, in lieu of a portion of his compensa-
tion, the Humane Society bought Hoyt a
$310,000 home in Maryland. It also al-
lowed Irwin to write himself $85,000 in
checks for another realestate venture,
which was later considered by the board
to be a loan.

HE QUESTIONABLE financial trans-

actions for Hoyt and Irwin prompted
the Humane Society board to hire two
Washington law firms to conduct sepa-
rate investigations of the dealings.

But, respected presidents of two of
the wealthiest animal organizations in
the country wrote letters defending
Hoyt, and complaining that we were out
of line to question the financial dealings.

Frederick J. Davis, president of the

 

,, . .r. . .g; j , '1; A." W. 4,
Massachusetts Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, defended
Hoyt.

John F. Kullberg, president of the
American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, wrote there was
nothing unusual about Hoyt’s salary.

We reported that Hoyt’s and Irwin’s
compensation did not stop with salaries.
In all, their salaries and benefits amount-
ed to more than $139,000 and $114,000
respectively.

Davis and Kulberg run wealthy

non-profit organizations themselves. A
1983 report published by an Ohio animal
rights group, Mobilization for Animals,
noted that Davis’ Massachusetts Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
was the wealthiest animal welfare group
in the country, with more than $40 mil-
lion in assets. Kullberg’s American Soci-
ety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals was in ninth place with $6 million in
assets. Hoyt’s Humane Society of the
United States placed fourth with assets
of more than $11 million.
ETER PAUL, a San Francisco jour-
nalist, recently finished a four-year
study of charities in the United States
and abroad. His upcoming book, “Easy
Pickings,” includes a chapter on animal
organizations. Paul told our associate
Jim Lynch, “1 tell peOple if you want to
get rich, get into AIDS, animal rights or
missing children.”

Paul thinks Humane Society litera
ture should include a disclaimer that the
national society is not connected with
local humane societies that must raise
their own funds to run animal shelters.

son and Joseph Spear.

HOUSTON POST - October 9, 1988

Kangaroos may be vanishing by

Americans almost succeeded some years
back in exterminating their national em-
blem, the bald eagle. Now, some observers
fear, the Australians are similarly endan-
gering their national symbol, the kangaroo.

And if you wear certain brands of jog-

ing shoes, you may be part of the prob—
. em.
'35 More than 26 million kangaroos and
Zwallabies have been killed in Australia over
,Zthe past seven years, primarily for their
ﬂuides. The hides are exported to Europe
Rand the US. and used in everything from
,haudbags to baseball gloves. These days,
,however, a lot of those soft kangaroo hides
twind up in jogging shoes.

Greenpeace, the militant environmental
group, is hopping mad over the slaughter
«of these often-comic marsupials and is now
Surging Americans to boycott Adidas, which

itsays is a leading producer of kangaroo-
:jhide shoes. '
Earlier in Britain, a Greenpeace spokes-
man said, four makers of sports shoes
agreed to .stop using kangaroo hides when

threatened with an ad campaign. These in-
cluded Nike and New Balance, the spokes-
man said.

Greenpeace is also urging Americans to
support a bill in Congress (HR 779), spo‘n-
sored by Rep. Robert J. Mrazek, D-N.Y.,
that would ban the importation of all kan-
garoo products. Nations .of the European
Economic Community approved a similar
ban last year.

Nevertheless, Australia, which is cele-
brating its bicentennial this year, has set a
record quota of more than 2.9 million kan-
garoos for killing in 1988.

Australian officials estimate there are 19
million of the three largest and most-hunt-
ed kangaroos — the eastern greys, western
greys, and the bigger reds. But the kanga-
roos’ defenders say there has never been a
really accurate count, and no one bothers
to keep track of the natural up—and-down
cycles of the kangaroo population.

Altogether, there are 48 species of kan—
garoos and wallabies, found only in Austra-
lia, New Guinea and nearby islands. They
range in size from, the tiny rat kangaroo to

the human-sized ZOO—pound reds.
Australia’s official position is that the
kangaroo population must be constantly

' thinned because the animals inflict heavy

damage on crops.

However, there has been little hard evi—
dence of the extent of that damage, and
many of the kangaroos are killed in the
remote outbacks where there are no crops
to damage.

Greenpeace bluntly describes the kanga-
roo kills as “the largest slaughter of wild
mammals in the world . . . a wildlife man—
agement program run amok.”

Some elements of the Australian govern-
ment, Greenpeace noted, are even urging

leaps and bounds

kangaroo farming to enhance the country’s
$10 million-a-year export trade. There are
also calls for consumption of kangaroo
meat.
Kangaroo meat is now eaten as a delica—
_ cy in some parts of the world, and it’s also
used in pet food. But most of the kanga-
roos —— 70 percent in Queensland, for ex-
ample —— are killed only for their skins.
The meat is left in the field to rot.

One Australian legislator, Sen. Norm
Sanders, an expatriate American who now
represents Tasmania, opposes the kanga-
roo kills and has sent letters to members of
the US. Congress urging support of Mra-
zek’s bill.

“lt IS commonly believed that only pro—
fessronal shooters take part in the kill, that
they can recognize and avoid killing rare or
endangered species, and that they shoot
accurately to minimize the animals’ suffer-
ing,” Sanders wrote.

“The truth is that 90 percent of the
shooters are part—time itinerants earning
pocket money. Neither their marksman-

ship nor their ability to differentiate species
15 tested prior to the granting of a commer-
cial license.”

There are reports of limbs being hacked
off wounded kangaroos, and of the club-
bing to death of joeys, or baby kangaroos,
found with their mothers.

. In 1974, the US. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice put eastern and western greys and red
kangaroos on its threatened list and
banned the import of any products from
those animals.

Historically, however, the US. is the
world’s third largest importer of kangaroo
products, and in 1981 the Reagan adminis-
tration, under pressure from the Australian
government, lifted the ban.

Australia at that time estimated it had 32
million kangaroos. Two years later,
strangely, the estimate was reduced to 19
million.

But no one at this point really knows
how many kangaroos there are —-— or how
long they wrll last if the steadily escalating

. slaughter goes on.

MERRIT Island is one of the
United States’ most important
wildlife refuges. It is also the
most oddly placed.

Perched on the eastern sea-
board of Florida, it is home to
some of America’s rarest ani-
mals—and also the technologi-
cal powerhouse of the Kennedy
Space Centre.

It is a remarkable juxtaposi-
tion. While Kennedy’s
launches— including the space
shuttle mission that ended last
week—absorb the world’s
attention, an astonishing array of
300 different species have found
a discreet haven on Merrit.

In fact, there are more endan-
gered animals living there than
on any other US wildlife sanctu-
ary— including bald eagles, salt
marsh and indigo snakes, falcons
and several species of sea turtle.

Far from facing extinction
because of rocket launches, these
animals owe their existence to
the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, owner of
the reserve, says Don Whitmore,

 

ROBIN McKlE visits a
unique wildlife refuge.

neers built the Canaveral space
centre, later renamed after Pres-
ident Kennedy.

The feats of rocketry achieved
there are a matter of world
renown. The effect on American

wildlife is less well known.

‘More than a thousand people
a day have been moving into
Florida for the past two decades.
Most have settled on this coast,’
says Mr Whitmore. -

‘They have built houses and
towns that have destroyed the
other unique capes. If it was not
for the space centre—which
uses Merrit as a buffer between
it and the outside world—the
precious animals that have

homes here would be extinct. or.

at least very close to it.’
One example is provided by

the manatee~a large, aquatic
mammal, a sort of ugly dolphin.
Today most of Florida’s few sur—
vivrng manatees are found in the
restricted waters round Merrit
Island where they are protected
against the ravages of motor
cruisers whose propellers would
otherwise kill them. ‘

In fact, the cape (sand bars
join the island to the mainland)
forms a wide variety of habitats,
the result of a unique combina-
tion of events.

Thousands of years ago, melt
waters from glaciers washed
debris into the Atlantic. This
ﬂotsam was carried down the
coast by ocean currents and
slowly accumulated in strips that
run parallel to the Florida coast.
This is where the different habi—
tats have developed.

They include sandy coasts,

where turtles nest, scrub land,
pine Woods and lagoons contain- ’

ing both fresh and salt water
marshes. In addition, because
the refuge forms a prominent

int on the coast, migrating
irds flock to it.

‘DEKALB REVS/SUN - Atlanta - October 12, 1988
_-A Bunch Of Furry Creatures
Have 'Taken Up' At Their Home

By FAY M. RUSSELL
Special To The News

' DeKalb resident Bob Lyday has
dozens of pets in his backyard.
Every night he puts out three or
four dishes of dogfood for the small
furry creatures and watches over
them as they climb the steps to his
patio to feed.

So what? Everyone has dogs,
you say.

But Bob’s pet’s are not dogs.

They are raccoons — or “bandits”

— as he calls the black-masked
mammals.
And he has most of them named.

- There are Friendly, Big Mama and

' Little Mama.

“We started feeding the coons
about three years ago,” Bob re-
calls. “They kept getting into our
garbage cans -— our neighbor even
tied the lid on his garbage can, and
they untied it with their teeth.
One night I put out some food, and
they came right up on the patio to
eat.”

Bob says that racoons eat with
their hands. Some are right-pawed,
some are left. “Sometimes they
hold onto my hand with one paw
while they eat with the other.”

There are three generations of
raccoons in the Lyday backyard.
“We have 20 or 20 in all,” Bob
says. “There are 13 little ones, I

know.”

Their favorite food is ﬁsh. “They
eat just about anything we eat,”
Bob says. “They like grapes, ba-
nanas, rice and they will eat their
weight in spaghetti. They love wat-
ermelon, cantaloupe and candy.

“I used to give them jellybeans,
but they couldn’t chew those too
well. They absolutely love sweets,
and I give them cookies about
every night.” ~

One day. Dottie Lyday, Bob’s
wife, made a batch of chocolate
chip cookies and left them out on
the table. “I went back to get one,
and there were no cookies,” she
says. “You can imagine who got
them.”

“Coons do not like potatoes, car-
rots or peas,” Dottie goes on. “One
night I ﬁxed a tuna casserole with
green peas and put the leftovers
outside for them. Next morning,
the tuna had been eaten, but green
peas were all over the patio. I
made Bob clean up the mess.”

The Lydays live on a heavily
wooded lot with a creek ﬂowing
across the back. “We have two
coon families in one of our hollow
trees,” Bob says. “They live in
trees like squirrels, and they have
to be near water because they
wash all their food.

They usually mate in January

Racoons On The Lyday Patio

and have their babies in the
spring. Since they are nocturnal
animals, they come up to eat at
night. If a mama coon is nursing
her babies, she will eat but won’t
allow them near the food. When
the babies are about a year old,
mama shoves them out on their
own.”

Dottie says when they eat out

they always ask the waitress to
sack up their leftovers for their
critters.
’ Raccoons have sharp teeth.
About two months ago, while Bob
was feeding them out of his hand,
Friendly bit him. “But she didn’t
mean to,” he~is quick to explain. “I
don’t think they can see well at
close range, and she thought the
end of my ﬁnger was a cookie.”

Bob had to take rabies shots at
the State Health Department, and
they cost him $500. “My doctor
said we could have Friendly put to
sleep and determine if she had
rabies, but I said no. She had three
babies, and they needed her. So I
just took the shots.”

When the Lydays go out of town,
their neighbors leave notes on
their front door, saying: “We’re
upset that you aren’t home. Please
leave us some food next time,”
signed “the coons.”

 




ARIZONA REPUBLIC — Phoenix

New drink
" ready to go
to the dogs

Canine cocktail
Vitamin-fortiﬁed

By Susan Doerfler
The Arizona Republic

Jim Towery’s thirst quencher
comes in a four-pack, not the
traditional six-pack. But then, his
drink is anything but traditional.

It’s for the dogs.

Mr. Benz’s, named after Towery’s

brother—in-law’s dog, comes in 10— .

ounce, clear bottles that are ﬁlled
with'either chicken— or beef-flavored
vitamin-fortified water.

For years, dogs have not had the
beverage choices of humans, said
Towery, who is marketing director
for Dinelle Interprises, the packer
and subsidiary of Specialty Beverage
Co., the manufacturer.

“They drink water. Water
cleanses the body, but. it doesn’t
provide any nutrients,” he said in a
telephone interview from Visalia,
Calif, where the firms are located.

Mr. Benz’s, which has a photo of
the namesake, a white West High—
land terrier, on the front, contains
vitamins A, D—2 and B-12, and
thiamine, riboﬂavin, pantothenic
acid, niacin and pyridoxine.

It. is being marketed locally
through Smitty’s and is available for
$1.99 a four-pack at two stores, at
Via Linda and Pima Road in
Scottsdale and Alma School and
Warner roads in Chandler.

Towery was in the Valley earlier
this month to demonstrate the
, product at the two stores. Because

 

 

the drink is not made for human
consumption, he brought along his
own testers: Mr. Benz’s son and
cousin.

Because of the canines, the
demonstration booths had to be set
up outside the grocery stores.

Mike Garcia, an assistant man-
ager at. the Scottsdale Smitty’s, said
many of the shoppers were incredu-
lous.

“We got a lot of strange looks,”
he said, laughing. “Their first
responses were, ‘Noooo. Come on.’ ”

- September 28, 1988

Even so, 480 sample bottles were
handed out to interested dog owners.

Another assistant manager, Terry
Lucchesi, said, “It’s a real, honest-
to-goodness product.

“You know what I found interest—
ing about it is you can have it cold,
over dog food or as ice cubes.”

Towery said the Japanese thought
of the ice cubes. The product also is
sold in Japan. '

Garcia said he thinks the product
will sell well because so many people
treat their dogs like humans.

' Mike Ging/The Arizona Republic
Mr. Benz’s, a vitamin-fortified drink for dogs, is being marketed in the Valley at two Smitty's stores.

Jane Muto, a secretary at Galaxy
Foods, the local distributor of the
drink, said, “They have these pet
cemeteries and everything for dogs.”

So why not a drink?

“It’s a cute idea. Plus it’s good for
the dogs,” Muto said.

Her three dogs “really gobbled it.
up,” she added.

Towery, who remained doggedly
serious about. the drink, said that
large canines seem to prefer the beef
ﬂavor, while smaller ones like the
chicken variety.

Guts y Police Dog Dies Taking ,
A Bullet Meant for His Master

Remarkable true tales of animals' courage, devotion and sacrifice
pack the pages of the new book "Real Animal Heroes," edited by
Paul Drew Stevens. In the following final installment from the
book, you’ll read the heart-touching story of a police dog's devo-
tion to his human partner . . . and learn how an amazingly intelli-
gent sheepdog saved the life of her young owner.

By ZU VINCENT

Police officer Mike Pruitt and his K-9 partner Gero were al-
ways the best of pals — but their friendship was shattered for-
ever on a spring day in 1986 when the brave German shepherd

sacrificed his life to save Pruitt.

The c0p-dog team responded to a
burglary call. Other officers from
the Gainesville, Fla., Police Depart-
ment had already surrounded the
building by the time they arrived.
Suddenly, the burglar rushed out ——
and ran right toward the officers
with a pistol in his hand.

As the burglar charged the police
blockade, he lowered his gun and shot
at the crouching officers. Gero rush-
ed him. The thief fired again, blasting
Gero through the shoulder.

The heavy-caliber slug did not
stop the dog’s lunge. As blood
spurted from a hole in his coat, Gero
flew at the thief and locked his teeth
on the gunman’s arm.

In the next few seconds the thief
grappled with the growling dog, his
fingers still clutching his weapon.
Another shot split the air as he fired
a third time, sending a bullet into
Gero at point-blank range.

The force of the blast flung Gero
back. Quickly, the thief turned his
gun on the officers, sending bullets
screaming over their heads as they
ducked for cover.

More shots rang out as the officers

 

 

 

returned fire. Rushing forward, Offi-
cer Pruitt found himself momen-
tarily exposed, feeling a brief surge
of panic as he saw the thief leveling
the deadly gun on him. -

But Gero, though terribly wound-
ed, managed to lunge between
Pruitt and the gunman. Gero took
the bullet himself.

The animal’s courageous move
gave Pruitt and another officer just
enough time. Firing two shots each,
they dropped the burglar where he
stood. Rushing to his friend and
partner, Pruitt found Gero’s body al-
ready curled in death.

Until that tragic day, Pruitt had
always ended his workday by stop-
ping at a convenience store and buy-
ing a candy bar, which he shared
with Gero. And at the memorial ser-
vice honoring the K-9 hero that had
acted far above and beyond the call
of duty, more than 100 fellow offi-
cers watched as Officer Pruitt
placed a candy bar in the short,
stout coffin.

Lassie, a Shetland Sheepdog, slept
at the foot of her 6-year-old master
Gary Gustafson’s bed every night.
On an evening in 1956, she was in
the right place at the right time to
save his life.

Gary had just returned to his San
Carlos, Calif, home following a ton-
sillectomy. Lassie was curled at the

foot of the bed, as usual, when
Gary’s parents checked on him be-
fore turning in themselves.

The Gustafsons’ bedroom was at
the opposite end of the house from
Gary’s, so it was only Lassie that
woke later when the little . boy
started to tremble. She came imme-
diately alert and listened to his gur-
gled breathing. Gary had suddenly
begun hemorrhaging. He could lit-
erally bleed to death in a matter of
minutes without medical attention.

Half-conscious, the little boy call-
ed out and stumbled from bed in an
attempt to reach the door. He col-
lapsed on the floor. Lassie ran to his
side, whining and licking his cheek.
She was unable to revive him.

Lassie ran down the hall‘to the
bedroom of Gary’s parents. Smart
and obedient, she’d been taught
never to enter their room. Yet for
once she ignored her training and
threw herself at the closed bedroom
door until it swung open. Then she
raced into the room yelping.

The elder Gustafsons aroused

from a sound sleep to find the little
, dog running around their bed. Mr.

Gustafson was confused. Lassie had
never before broken the rule about
entering their room, and he ordered
her out sternly. The dog only barked

louder and shook the bedclothes

furiously with her teeth.

Mr. Gustafson sighed and climbed
out of bed. He decided she wanted to
go outside and headed toward the
back door. Lassie wouldn’t follow.

Gary’s life was slipping away with
each second that passed. Anxiously,
Lassie planted herself in the hall-
way leading to his bedroom door.
Then she raced up to Mr. Gustafson
and turned, racing back to Gary’s
room. When he stood there, uncom-
prehending, she repeated the move.

Twice, and then a third time,

 

she raced back and forth, whining.

At last Mr. Gustafson gave a start
and, realizing what the little Shet-
land Sheepdog wanted, followed her
into Gary’s room. There he found
his son lying in a pool of blood.

Gary was rushed to the hOSpital
and given emergency treatment.
He’d lost so much blood that there
was no doubt in the minds of the at-
tending physicians that Lassie had
saved his life. Another 15 minutes
would have proven fatal to the boy. .

For saving her master’s life, Gary
Gustafson’s quick-witted and de-
voted dog Lassie was awarded the
Ken-L Ration Dog Hero of the Year
Award for 1956. .

ATLANTA JOURNAL - Oct. 13, 1988

Animal-Controi Chief

  Resigns Post in Cobb '

After Getting in Fight _

By Katie Long
Staﬂ Writer '

, The head of Cobb County’s ani-

mal control department, Nicholas
; Marinelli, has resigned amid accu-
ﬁ sations by the Cobb County Humane
Society that he assaulted one of its
members and has perpetuated un-
healthy conditions at the county an-
imal shelter.

“I feel like a man in his posi-
tion, who deals with the public, los-
ing his temper and striking anyone,
is of concern,” Phyllis Counce, the
Cobb Humane Society’s incoming
' president, said Wednesday.

Mr. Marinelli, a former Atlanta

' homicide detective, admitted hit-

ting Mikel Petrakos on June 25. He
: said Mr. Petrakos “cursed and belit-
tled” his employees, and he said he
did not throw the ﬁrst punch. A po-
lice report ﬁled after the incident
quoted witnesses as saying Mr. Mar-
inelli initiated the fight over the
condition of dog runs at the animal
‘ shelter on County Farm Drive. No
charges were ﬁled in the incident.

Cobb’s animal control depart-
ment operates the 24-hour shelter
, with assistance from Humane Soci-
ety volunteers. The department also
enforces the county’s leash law and
runs a petting farm.

Mr. Marinelli, who assumed his
position in April, said Wednesday
‘ the department is in the best “fiscal

and physical condition” ever. Last
,year, the shelter was. investigated
for possible misuse of funds and
employees taking home pedigreed
dogs. ‘

teer Humane Society disagree with
Mr. Marinelli’s assessment.

They contend the shelter is
plagued by untended animals, ﬁlthy
cages, rude employees, early clos-
ings, high illness rates, insufﬁcient
personnel and falling adoption
rates.

“He came in and cleaned up the
administrative portion but did noth-
ing for the animals,” Mr. Petrakos
said.

“It’s not just this one incident,”
Connie Boughan, a Marietta attor-
ney and Humane Societv board

But members of Cobb’s volun-i

member, said about the June ﬁght.“
“There’s a whole litany of them.”

Humane Society workers said‘

they have complained for months

about shelter conditions, employ-”

ees’ attitudes and Mr. Marinelli’s

temper. “We have seen a lot of

abuse, with food and water and

jerking them around and kicking
them,” said Pat Davis, a Humane‘
Society volunteer. “We’re really

concerned about the animals out

there, but we’ve been getting lip.
'service for months, and months, and ;

months.”

Mr. Marinelli said he was repri-.
manded for the June incident by his;
supervisor, Robert Ash, who heads,
the community services department,~
after Mr. Petrakos threatened to.

sue.
Shelter conditions improved

during the following week, Mr. Pe-v
trakos said, but worsened again the ,
next week. Since then, the relation-;
ship between the volunteer organi- -

zation and the county department
has deteriorated even further.

After Mr. Petrakos again threat- '
ened to take legal action over the .

June incident and after a Sept. 22

meeting at which Humane Society.
members vowed their concerns, Mr. ..

Marinelli decided to resign.

Mr. Ash said Wednesday that he

and Mr. Marinelli came to a “mutu-

al decision” earlier this month that '

the resignation, effective Oct. 21,

would be best for the department. . i
“We are a government agency,._
an extension of law enforcement, _

we can’t be run on emotions,” Mr.

Marinelli said. “We can coexist with 7.
the Human Society, but it has to ,

have structure.”
Mr. Marinelli said he was in the

midst of a two-year revitalization '
program and that his “policies ,

didn’t please everyone.”
The Humane Society and the
animal control department have al-

ways had problems because the Hu- -.
mane Society “acts as a watchdog to

the shelter, and animals can’t speak

for themselves,” said Jean Wright, ‘

who serves on the Humane Soci-
ety’s board of directors and the
county’s animal control commissmn.

Horse Heaven

t was a rare coalition of Indi-
Ians and ranchers that formed
last year to battle plans by gi-
ant Honeywell Inc. to test

‘ weapons around South Dako-

ta’s rugged Hell Canyon. The

i tests would damage the envi-

ronment and destroy sites sa-

' cred to the Sioux, they argued. ‘

Protecting its image, Hon-
eywell gave up the plan and its
property‘in the area. The prob-
lem then for Gov. George Mick-
elson was to ﬁnd a purchaser
and a purpose for the land.
Enter Dayton 0. (Hawk)
Hyde, a 62-year-old author and
Wildlife crusader. He raised
funds to buy the Honeywell
property and other land nearby
as the nation’s ﬁrst private
sanctuary for wild horses. With
300 people looking on last
week, 40 mustangs were set
free in the area. Hyde’s Insti-
tute of Range and American
Mustang will eventually shel-
ter about 750 wild horses in
two South Dakota sanctuaries
totaling 28,300 acres—receiv-

f. ing $1 per horse per day from
i the federal Bureau of Land
Management, which is legally

required to protect wild horses.
After three years, Hyde reck-
ons Hell Canyon will pay for
itself through donations and
tourist admissions.

-~ A Wash seal is held still by Julie Guy at the RSPCA/Greenpeace emergency
centre in Docking, Norfolk, so that Carole Clarke can inject the new vaccine

Wash seals given new vaccine

EXPERIMENTS to save the
Wash seal colony began yes-
terday at the £40,000 joint
RSPCA/Greenpeace emer-
gency centre at Docking,
Norfolk, as the Government
was called on to provide more
ﬁnancial help.

Four young seals were given a
new vaccine, Kavak ID, devel-
oped by a Dutch company Du-
phar, in the hope that it will help
them ﬁght the canine distemper
virus which is severely reducing
North Sea seal communities.

Mr Henry Bellingham, Conser-
vative MP for Norfolk NW, said:
“As many as 70 per cent of the
Wash seals are already dead.

“The problem is getting worse,
not better, and Iii/oak" hope the
Governmentlcan come up with

By Robert Bedlow

funds for the rescue centre...and
at the same time look at the seri-
ous pollution in the North Sea.”

The vaccine has already been
given to seals at a sanctuary in
Inverkeithing, Fife, but scien-
tists doubt that it can do any-
thing to halt the spread of the
epidemic that has already killed
an estimated 14,000 seals — 2,000
of them in British waters.

Vets at Docking said the vac-
cine would provide protection
but not a cure. It is thought that
as many as 20,000 of Britain’s
25,000 common and grey seals
could die.

The vaccine is to be given only
to those seals that are healthy or
in the ﬁrst stages of the disease.
Those that appeared to have

recovered from the virus would
not be given jabs because they
had built up an immunity against
it.

Mrs Carole Clarke, a King’s
Lynn vet‘predicted it would be
three months before the effec-
tiveness of the vaccine would be
known and the seals could be
returned to the wild.

The centre has only enough
money for an eight-week opera-
tion, but the RSPCA is hoping it
would run for at least nine
months.

It is already desperately short
of infra-red lamps to give
warmth to the seals. It also needs
more water and pumps for pools
under construction.

Mrs Clarke said that there was
a need for a permanent centre,
with continual vetinary care.

the elephants at the Zoo are getting
is from the media.

As a private citizen, by making
some calls and paying a visit to the
Zoo, humble me was able to find out
some interesting facts that all the

not unearth.

One of the Zoo critics given lots of

some years ago because the Zoo
forbade her from playing violin mu-
sic to camels.

A second critic, a keeper, hasn’t
worked at the elephant house in
years.

Tinkerbelle's “wound from

cheek abscess, not caused by a
hook, obviously. (T o The Chronicle’s
credit they mentioned this on Octo-
ber 4.)

The elephant house may have
had “four injuries in the past 10

She is absolutely right. All are
acts of bullies and thugs. The
thought of such people having any

LOS ANGELES TIMES - October 5, 1988

 

A RUSH OF WINGS

 

Feathers Fly Whenever Falconers See Themselves
as Being the Prey of Overzealous Wildlife Ofﬁcials

..'dn “all-{311" pI’nous

 

 

 

 

RICH ROBERTS / Los Angeles Times

Master falconer Scott Francis of Escondido says falconry is “more than a sport, it's a life style."

By RICH ROBERTS,
Times Staff Writer

heasant season for falcon-

ers opened last weekend

in California, not that

many were aware of it—
least of all the pheasants.

There are fewer than 700 peo-
ple licensed by the state to prac-
tice 'falconry, in which raptors,
birds of prey, are used to catch
other birds or small game, de—
pending on the season.

“And the kill rate is not very
high,” says Scott Francis, a mas-~
ter falconer from Escondido.
“About 50 to 60% for an adult
bird, maybe 25% for a young bird
near the end of a season.”

Those 700 represent about one-
fourth of the national total, and,
according to Brian Walton, who
breeds falcons at UC Santa Cruz,
“probably half don’t have birds—
and some have birds that
shouldn’t.”

Walton’s last comment hints at
a commotion in the sport that
seems far out of proportion to the
number of activists and the hunt-
ing harvest. They say their sport
has far less impact on the envi-
ronment than most modes of

hunting, and that falconers un—
derstand it a lot more than the
people who criticize it or try to

._ regulate it.

One of the latter, Celeste Cush-
man, the Department of Fish and
Game warden who is coordinator
of the falconry program, is being
moved to a different position.

Falconers say good riddance.

- Her boss says good job.

The difference of opinion may
be explained by the attitudes
involved when one of God’s crea-
tures is unleashed to kill another.

Cushman, for one, characteriz-
es falconers as a sort of independ-
ent sub-culture that resists au-
thority.

Sherry Teresa finds herself in
the center of the three-sided
controversy among authorities,
falconers and bird lovers. She is a
DFG biologist based in Ventura
and also a licensed falconer who
works with the National Audubon
Society.

“It’s real unfortunate there are
such problems between falconers
and Fish and Game,” she said.
“Part of it is that a lot of falconers
are kind of loners, rebels.

“It’s hard, too, because we have
wardens who are in charge of
inspecting and licensing who

don’t have one-tenth the knowl-
edge that the falconers do.
They’re law-enforcement peo-
1e.”
p Falconers have no trouble rec-
onciling the beauty of the sport to
its ultimate purpose: the destruc-
tion of the prey. They rhapsodize

about the spectacular dive, or

stoop, of a peregrine falcon in
pursuit of its quarry.

“They’ll go up so high and just
wait there and then drop out of
the sky like a bullet,” Teresa said.
“It’s very exciting.”

Gary Boberg, like Francis a
master falconer, said: “We’re not
out to rack up a bunch of numbers
as far as hunting success but go
for a stylish flight. You try to
teach the bird to fly for 15 or 20
minutes while it mounts a thou-
sand feet into the sky, and then,
at just the right time, you flush
the ducks and they come off the
pond, and you watch the falcon
dropping at 200 mph, shifting
and spinning around.

“It’s a pretty simple machine. It
hunts and eats. It’s doing some-
thing it does naturally.”

The bird doesn’t give an owl’s
hoot about style. All it cares about
is food. That’s why in training;

the falconer will not flush or
release prey until the bird is
satisfactorily high.

It must be taught to hunt
efficiently. In the 19705, DDT and
other pesticides all but destroyed
the natural peregrine population,

causing thin-shelled eggs that .

would break in the nest.

Captive breeding programs,
such as Walton’s Predatory Bird
Research Group at UC Santa Cruz
and the Snake River Birds of

Prey program near Boise, Ida., 3'

are restoring some of the endan-
gered species, including pere-
grines. But, lacking parents, if

released in the wild a young bird ‘

has only a 10% chance of survival
his first year, so those facilities
lend young birds to qualified
falconers for a couple of years of
training.

FalConers refer to their birds as
“hunting companions,” but it’s
clear that the roles are reversed
from that of man and dog. In
falconry, it is the man who flush-
es the game and the creature that
kills it—and, in most cases, keeps
it for itself.

“I don’t know any falconers
that ever eat what their birds
catch," Boberg said.

Added Francis: “They don’t
have much affection, but they do
recognize individuals.”

Francis’ bird is a female, which
is one-third larger than a male.
Some falconers don’t even name
their birds. It’s just “the bird.” But
a responsible falconer will try to
spend time every day flying,
weighing, feeding and otherwise
caring for his bird to keep it in top
shape.

“It’s more than a sport,” Fran-
cis said. “It’s a life style.”

Francis, 33, is a carpenter by
trade and single—not unusual for
a falconer. Boberg, 33, is married
and a sales representative for a
heating-air conditioning firm.

Early on a recent morning they
took Francis’ bird to an open field

east of the San Diego Wild Ani-
mal Park where distractions
would be minimal. -

First, Francis removed the
leather strap restraints, or jesses,
from the birds’ legs and put a
little hell on one leg, so he could
track the bird if he lost sight of it

in the air or if it pursued downed '
game in the brush. Then he
donned a heavy glove, or gaunt-
let, and removed the little leather '
hood with the traditional plume

on top.

The bird remained calm, al-
though, Francis said, “When the
hood comes off, they know

they’re going to fly.”

Falcons, distinguishable by I

their pointed wings, hunt from
,the” sky, circling and “waiting
on, as falconers say, until time to

strike. ' Hawks, which have
rounded wing tips, stay on the fist

0’ until the game is flushed.

Francis’ bird hopped onto his
gloved left fist, then swooped
away in a blast of his 3-foot

wingspan. Immediately, two "

flocks of blackbirds nearby
flushed into the air, reaching for
altitude.

“They want to stay above her,”
Boberg said. “As you flushgame,
the bird will come down with a
tremendous amount of speed and
knock down its prey with its
feet.”

The peregrine, its bell ringing,
ignored the blackbirds and, gain-
ing altitude, headed instead for a
nearby dairy, where pigeons
tended to loiter. Finding none, it
circled back, and Francis released
a pigeon he carried in a leather
pouch on his hip.

The pigeon and the falcon saw
each other at the same instant.
The pigeon flew low, toward
brush cover, and the .falcon,
starting at about 500 feet, came
zooming down from behind, like a
fighter plane. Just before contact,

though, the pigeon veered to one

side and the falcon missed.

By the time the falcon returned
for another pass, the pigeon was
in the brush, where falcons are at
a disadvantage with their big
wings and feet.

Boberg said, “It’s an everyday
process. You get a young bird and

you’re teaching it like its parents .

would teach it in the wild, how to
‘be a big, noble peregrine falcon.
You’re releasing game for it to
chase, and it almost always gets

away because the bird is young "

and hasn’t developed yet.
“But you watch the bird prog-
ress and grow until it’s strong and

learns how to maneuver and
stoop [until] . . . it really com—

mands the sky.”

Sometimes falconers feel that
although their birds are the pred-
ators, they are the prey-of the
bird-loving public.

“It’s wrong for somebody to say
that all killing is wrong,” Francis
said. “It’s hard to deal with these
people. The birds would be killing
in the Wild, anyway.”

When people say falconry is
uncivilized, advocates ask if it is
more civilized to shoot game with
a gun.

Francis said, “I am pro-hunt-
ing, but I prefer to do it with a
bird.”

Battling adverse attitudes over
the years has driven a lot of
falconers underground to practice

. their sport in seclusion.

Boberg said: “The people who
practice it are very elusive. It’s
very hard to find anybody in the
field.”

And when you find a falconer,

: Others realize they must win

public acceptance for their sport
to survive.

Francis said: “It is a blood
sport. It’s something you’d like to
keep to yourself. But too many

I, people have an interest in birds of

prey, so it has to be presented to

the public in a positive way." .
A California falconry license

costs $35, and an applicant must

have a licensed falconer as a ' '
sponsor to get one. The falconers
‘ ' are careful whom they sponsor.

“In 20 years, I’ve sponsored

only one person, and I’ve been
asked by many,” Boberg said.

An applicant must pass a writ-

? ten test, then serve an appren-

ticeship under his sponsor’s wing
for 2 years, when he receives a
general license. Five years later
he can be licensed as a master
falconer.

Meanwhile, he also must pur-
chase hunting licenses for the _
particular game he seeks.

In California, no raptor can be
taken from the wild and sold, and
only certain species can be kept.
by trappers. It's illegal to trap or

sell peregrines in the state.

All of this is why, the falconers
(Elomplain, the system gets bogged
own.

Boberg spoke of “people apply-
ing for permits to get a bird and
having to wait several months for
the paper work to come back, and.
by that time it’s too late to get the
bird.”

Cushman said it now takes five
working days. ,

She said: “There’s an element
within the falconry community
that’s not very cooperative with
the department.”

Certainly, the California
Hawking Club was out to get
Celeste Cushman. President Lar-
ry Baines, in a letter dated Jan.~
21, 1987, urged his membership to
document their complaints
against Cushman and demand her
removal. “I for one am tired of
being subjected to the wrath of
Warden Cushman,” he wrote.

Francis said: “There’s a need
for someone in [Cushman’s] posi-
tion, but it’s got to be a workable
arrangement.”

Two years ago, a petition

1 against Cushman was circulated

and sent to DeWayne Johnston,
chief of the DF‘G’s wildlife pro-
tection division. She is now being
moved to the animal welfare
department of the DFG.

“Every year it’s been a cam-

; paign to get rid of Celeste,” she

said. “It looks like they’ve finally
succeeded.”

Not so, Johnston said.

quitting their jobs two years ago and
cashing in their savings, he and Phyllis
borrowed money to launch the business
on their lZS-acre spread near Santo.
Their house overlooks the Brazos on the
land’s northern boundary; the snake
ranch fronts the lnterState 20 access
road on its southern edge.

The Popplewells spent months level-

ments. With their son, Bob and Phyllis
built a workshop, erected miles of chain
link fence. groomed mesquite trees, set
foundation forms, poured concrete and
dug trenches for the snake pits. When
they could; they paneled, insulated and
plumbed. last December, they opened
the museum/store and four concrete

picnics and camping trips.

Bob says his signs lure people be-

cause they instinctively want to over-

ﬁnancial impediments to the visit by
proclaiming the snake exhibit to be

The 6-year-old daughter of the relucrant

snake is perched over a tiny pond, lapping wa-

spirit. Bob had told him that sometimes the
snakes get into such a feeding frenzy that one
will swallow another rather than let go of his

be trying to give the mouse a concussion by

the mouse; it looks like a group of men fight-

DAILY TELEGRAPH - November 8, 1988

Killing for
the rhino

0 Greg Neale reports from Zimbabwe on
the bloody battle against the poachers

WAR is being fought in
Athe Zambezi Valley.

Daily. the officers and
men of Zimbabwe’s depart-
ment of National Parks and
Wildlife Management go into
battle against an elusive
enemy — the poachers who
cross the river from neighbour-
ing Zambia in search of Zimba-
bwe's “jewel”, the black
rhino.

It is a war that is both des-
perate and bloody. Since 1984,
the anti-poacher squads have
been operating a controversial
policy: shoot to kill.

Zimbabwe’s vice-president.
Simon Muzenda, defends the
policy robustly. “We are a sov~
ereign state. We will not sit

‘ back and watch gangs of ban—

dits plunder our wildlife heri-
tage." he says. “These poach-
ers are identical to economic
saboteurs. It would be suicidal
to have mercy on such people.”

For the men of the anti-
poacher patrol. the policy is
borne out of necessity. The
poachers often come equipped
with modern automatic
weapons,,and don’t hesitate to
use them against the rangers,

. to escape capture.

The anti-poacher strategy is
code-named Operation Strong-
hold. Its architect is Glenn
Tatham, Zimbabwe’s acting
chief game warden. Asked
whether the poachers are
being beaten. he is cautious.
“We’re winning time,” he
says. “Time to move as many
rhino as possible out of the val-
ley to safer areas, and to work
at getting better regional and
international co-operation that
might stop the horn trade.”

Since June 1984, Tatham’s
men have killed 43 poachers
and arrested 31. Some 4]
weapons have been seized,
together with more than 5.000
rounds of ammunition. But in
the same period. an estimated
450 black rhino have been
killed in the Zambezi Valley.
“And that's just the number of
carcasses we’ve found,”
Tatham points out grimly.
“There may have been many
more we’ve never discovered.”

Tatham estimates that at any

one time he has 80 men to pat-

rol a front-line of nearly 500
miles. They have been using a
helicopter. funded through the
World Wide Fund for Nature
(WWF), though the funding
may end soon. “There‘s also a
desperate shortage of four-
wheel-drive diesel vehicles.”
he says.

“We are talking about hav-
ing to cover a vast area of very
wild terrain.” (To the south-
east. anti-governrnent rebels
in Mozambique are also a
threat to Zimbabwe‘s rhino. as
they are to the country’s sup-
ply lines to the sea).

Finding the poachers in such
an area is an achingly difﬁcult
job for Tatham‘s men. and
often a heart-achingly bitter
one. “It‘s almost impossible to
detect them coming across the
river." Tatham says. “Often
the ﬁrst Sign we have of them
is when we hear their gun-
shots. or ﬁnd the dehorned car-
cass of a slaughtered rhino.”

The six-man patrols can call
on police or even army assis-
tance if the poachers are
tracked down. But all too often
they escape with their bloody
booty. across into Zambia.

Both Tatham and George
Pangeti, the deputy director of
the national parks and wildlife
management department.
acknowledge that effective co-
operation to pick up the poach-
ers at the Zambian border is as
yet far from successful.

“We have met with the gov-
ernments of Zambia and
Mozambique," Pangeti
relates. “There is a lot of good-
will. . . but the key to success
will be effective law enforce-
ment.” A training project for
the region‘s anti-poaching and
law enforcement agencies has
been mooted. But funds are
short.

Meanwhile the anti-poach-
ing patrols’ fruStration when
poachers escape is evident.
“There’s a lot of discussion
around the conference tables.
but we need co-operation in
the ﬁeld,” Tatham says. “The
Zambiansmust patrol their
side of the border effectively.

“Zambia has lost nearly

Meanwhile, the patrols con-
tinue. Convictions in Zimba-
bwe bear a heavy penalty. but
the potential rewards for the
poacher are also high: the man
who kills the rhino may make a
year’s income with a single
horn, while the middle men
who control the trade make
upwards of $60,000 from it.

Zimbabwe is the last strong-
hold for the black rhino. Can it
survive? “There are still
enough rhino left to warrant a

Tatham says. “But this is an

Wildlife Slaughter
takes sinister turn
in eastern Africa ii

 

By Alastair Mathes
Scripps Howard News Service

 

NAIROBI, Kenya — When a
heavily armed gang, believed to
be poachers, recently- opened
fire on a busload of tourists in

Kenya’s popular Meru National,

Park, it became apparent that
the large-scale slaughter of Afri-
ca’s wildlife is taking on a new,
more sinister dimension.
Although this is the first time
in East Africa that foreigners
have been deliberately attacked
and robbed by poachers, other
raiders with sophisticated fire-
arms have boldly confronted po-
lice, paramilitary anti-poaching
units and even army patrols in
several African countries. A few

days before the Meru incident, ’
three game rangers were killed -

by poachers in a shootout in the
Korea Game Reserve adjoining
the Meru park.

These events have taken place
just when Kenyan game authori-
ties have been criticized by con—
servationists for not taking

tougher measures against the ,

_ wave of poaching which threat-
' ens Kenya’s wildlife.-

2 As in neighboring countries,
' where outsiders have accused
. highly placed officials and poli-
; ticians of working hand in glove
‘ with poachers, Kenyan authori-
ties strongly resent any criti-
cism from foreigners. They in-

_ key, the noted paleontologist

and chairman of the East Afri-

 

‘nage by the poaching gangs as

 

.sist they’re doing their best to
Stop the illegal hunting in the
face of heavy odds.

Their most serious obstacle is

can Wildlife Society.
Describing the escalating car-

“economic sabotage” against the
country’s dollar-earning tourist
industry, Leakey has accused of-
ficials of collusion with poach-
ers who are harvesting ivory,
rhino horn and other animal
trophies. Muhoho in turn ac-
cused Leakey of “a cheeky white
mentality,” which he said
claimed that only white people
showed any concern for preserv-
ing Africa’s wild animals.

In many African countries,
those most concerned about the
slaughter of wildlife are non-Af-
ricans, who accuse the indepen-
dent governments of issuing
false game export permits and
shipping documents to permit
the illicit traffic to continue in
spite of international laws.

Several years ago a top Sudan-
ese official was alleged to have
issued many permits for ivory to
be shipped to the Far East, al-
though most of the tusks had ori-
ginated in countries as far away
as Tanzania and central Zaire.

 

 

 

more recently, burunui was 3
; pirpcinted as another "10"jlp ;
g hole“ for ivory. This ting: state .
' does not have a single elephant. 1
yet in 1986 it recorded an export
of 13,000 pairs of ivory tusks. Un-
like those other African states
which have elephant popula-
tions, Burundi has never signed
the international agreement re-
stricting the ivory traffic.

Although the lucrative Hong
Kong market is now closed to all
ivory shipments, a way has since
been found to get around the
new restrictions that cover only
“raw” (unworked) ivory.

Dealers from the Far East have

set up many small—s ale ivory

' carving operations along the

. route from Africa so that the
tusks arrive in Hong Kong al-

‘i ready carved into bangles, trin-

5 kets and other gewgaws that
fetch high prices.

Dubai, in the Persian Gulf, is
one center alleged to be used for
this subterfuge, turning a blind
eye to shipments from small-er
East African ports.

, The largest “reservoir” of
'- ivory-on—the-hoof is Zaire, where
, a vast expanse of dense rain for-
’ est in the northeast still shelters
more than 400,000 elephants,
largely hidden from human eye.
Elsehere in Africa, the story is
g one of rapid depletion over the
. past two decades. The decline in
East Africa is put at 95 percent in
the last 10 years.

Kenya, which has 22,000 ele-
phants, according to official
counts, has had 92 elephants
slaughtered within the last four.

., months. '
West Africa has no sizable ele-
, phant population now, as most
. were killed early in the century.
" However, small herds are to be
found in Ivory Coast, Liberia,
. Benin, Nigeria and Burkina
Faso.

In southern Africa, a notable
exception to the general pattern
of decline is‘ Zimbabwe, where s
the number of elephants has ris-
en since the large-scale slaugh-
ter during the “liberation war”
of the 1970s This has been attri-
buted to effective wildlife man-
agement since independence.

Part of the secret has been en-
suring that local communities .
near the elephants’ habitat de-
rive direct benefit from their
conservation through visitors’
gate fees and other revenue
from the proceeds of wildlife uti-
lization. Game ranching is also
popular there, and among the
500 or so ranchers of wildlife are
some who are rearing elephants.

Judge stays
eviction
_ of pet lover

:Woman with five cats
in trailer to get hearing

By LARRY KELLER
Staff Writer

‘ ‘ Attempts by a southwest Broward mo-
bile home park to evict a tenant who has
~Zfive cats were thwarted, at least temporar-
‘ily, on Friday when a judge enjoined the
park from evicting the woman until a court
"hearing next month.

Broward Circuit Judge Patricia W. Co—
calis granted Selma Eisenberg’s request
for a temporary restraining order that pre-
vents Rexmere Village from proceeding
with plans to evict her. Eisenberg received
.an eviction notice on Oct. 6.

“ The owner of Rexmere Village has di-
rected park management to show “no mer-
cy” toward Eisenberg, 63. She has lived at
the ‘mobile home park for 10 years.

Cocalis said she will conduct a hearing
next month to determine whether Eisen-
‘berg can stay or must leave the park.

‘ ' Eisenberg is in violation of a county or-

dinance that limits to two the number of
;cats a mobile home resident can own. In
August, the county Code Enforcement
Board ordered her to get rid of her excess
pets.

Eisenberg’s lawyer, Norman Kent, has
sued Rexmere Village and the county, con-
‘tending that the Ordinance is unconstitu-
tional because it restricts mobile home
residents to fewer pets than people living

in houses.

If Cocalis rules that the ordinance is val-
id, Kent will contend that it has been selec-
tively enforced against his client. Eisen-
berg says other residents of the park are in
violation of the pet ordinance, but only she
has been threatened with eviction.

Rexmere Village attorney Daniel Hess
said on Friday that the restraining order is
unnecessary.

“The actual eviction of Miss Eisenberg
is not imminent,” he told Cocalis. “It is not
an emergency at this time.”

Countered Kent: “We don’t have to wait
until she’s evicted to argue the deprivation
of constitutional rights.”

Kent said he has tried several times in
vain to settle the case. A July 12 letter
written by Rexmere Village owner, attor-
ney James M. Dale of Los Angeles. to the
park’s manager, Ron Schultz, and mistak-
enly sent to Kent may explain why.

Wrote Dale: “Our position at the hearing
should, of course, be that we want no mer-
cy whatsoever and would prefer that [Ei— ,
senberg] be ordered to leave with her "
cats.”

The diminutive Eisenberg said she can’t
conceive of getting rid of any of her cats,
three of which are old.

“They’re my children,” she said.

 

 




DENVER POST - October 2, 1988

By David McQuay
Denver Post Staff Writer - .

‘ IN THE GULF OF ST. LAWRENCE —
For miles there was ice and blue water
and days-old fur. Seeing human beings ap
proach them, the yellowish-white baby
harp seals bleated for their mothers, who
would hide in the water and then pop up
through ice holes and peek at the Visitors.

Every March, 250,000 harp seals bear
their young here on the ice.

On this windy March day there were 15
or 20 of us, including Brian Davies, the
Scottish environmentalist who persuaded
Canada to ban the slaughter of baby seals,
who was with his wife and grandchildren
on the ice, finishing a video for the Interna-
tional Fund for Animal Welfare and watch-
ing the kids pet the seals.

Vivid memory

Over the cry of the seals, Davies remem-
bered very clearly how he decided to bat-
tle the seal killers. In 1965, when he was
working for the New Brunswick Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
he went out on the ice and saw the after-
math of the slaughter. The gulf was “red
with bloody slush. It was a spider web of
blood.”

The following year he witnessed the
slaughter. He and veterinarian Elizabeth
Simpson decided to do post-mortems on
the seals “to see if they had been dead
when the skinning process commenced.
Neither of us had seen a baby seal killed.
As we stepped back atop the ice, we saw a
baby seal clearly skinned alive. The ani-
mal was on its back, straining, its heart

still beating. Elizabeth said, ‘My God, that _

animal is alive.’

“I think that as of that minute, I decided
to do everything I could to halt the slaugh-
ter.” There were 50,000 baby seals killed in
two and a half days.

Seal-skinning was a 250-year-old tradi-
tion, and Davies risked his life trying to
stop it. The only hotel on Prince Edward
Island that would allow him a room was
the Kirkwood, owned by the generous Mur-
_ phy family. Davies’ persistence paid off;

in 1983 the European Economic Communi-

‘ ty banned baby seal products, and last .

year Canada banned the slaughter.

Davies has been attacked for killing a
viable source of income, but he has sug—
gested a creative alternative to the seal
slaughter. Tourists are continually looking
for more exotic places to go. Surely, he
thought, there are people who would want

to fly out on the ice floes and see one of the ,

It’s working. The seal hunt was worth
about $3 million a year, and next year Seal
Watch wﬂl be worth $1.5 million. By 1991
he estimates, the tourist dollars will equal
the income from the slaughter. (Of course
the seal killers are not harvesting the tour:
1st. dollars; the profits now are going to
Prince Edward Island hotel owners, res-

. taurateurs, shopkeepers, helicopter opera-

tors, and airlines. Davies’ advice to the
slaughterers is:

them. Their appeal is obvious:
they have big dark eyes, a round
furry face, and are as cute as kit-
tens. I wonder whether the seal
slaughter would have been halted
and the tourism industry would
have risen so quickly if the baby
seals were stone ugly. Would we
pay all this money to see toads? Or
arctic hyenas‘? I doubt it.

Trying to masquerade as seals,
we slowly crawled on our hands
and knees toward the chubby
whitecoats, some of which were
growing as portly as Oliver Hardy.
At birth they are about 20 pounds,
but gain 4.4 pounds a day drinking
their mothers’ milk until they
weigh 75 pounds or more at wean-
ing. '

Many of the babies stiffened rig-
idly, as if in temporary shock, but
others were more relaxed and
quite pettable. I noticed that the
snowy-haired old ladies had the
best luck petting the seals. Maybe
the babies thought they were
whitecoats. The ice had become an
arctic petting 200.

I tried to pet one, but the little
bugger snarled at me, no doubt

mistaking me for a polar bear. I

crawled in a different directions,

and was greeted with more growls,
the seal version of a Bronx cheer.
Adult seals’ heads suddenly popped
up and watched me. Two big ma-
mas crawled toward me with the
quickness of . alligators waking
from a nap. They are about 51/2
feet long, weigh nearly 300 pounds,
and can bite With conviction. A ba-
by seal relieved itself near my leg.

“Nice little baby,” I said, but the
seals were not buying it. On the
other hand, an old lady crawled up
to one and rubbed its belly, as if it
were her pet basset hound. One of
Brian Davies’ grandchildren was
more aggressive, poking and yell-
ing at a seal that wouldn’t cooper-
ate with his requests.

“Don’t tease the seals!" the
Scotsman sharply told the boy.
That was the worst crisis of the
day, and the only blood on the ice
was from the seals“ birth. A storm
was approaching, and Davies de-
cided that we should return to
Prince Edward Island. The weath-
er changes quickly on the ice, and
it is easy to get stranded in a snow-
storm if you aren‘t careful.

Brian Davies says he will be

here every March for the rest of
his life. He says it’s not certain
that EurOpe will renew the ban on
seal products. “You win a battle,
never the war,” he says. “It will go
on forever, when I’m dead and
gone?’

As I left this floating, magical
wildlife reserve I lifted my cooling
coffee and toasted the seals: May
your hearts, and may Brian Da-
vies’ spirit, beat forever on this
dangerous planet.

girl in August, inflicting needle-like puncé
ture wounds over the infant’s body.

Opinions on the relative dangers of fer-
rets are mixed, as are opinions on wheth-
er they should be considered domestic or
wild animals.

Dr. Brandon Cox, a Fort Lauderdale
veterinarian, said a ferret attack as vi-
cious as that reported in Palm Beach
County is rare. .

But because ferrets are unpredictable,
she does not recommend them as pets, es-

‘ pecially for families with youngsters.

“As long as everything is going their
way, then they’re fine,” Cox said.

“But if you grab them and they are not
expecting it and they don’t want to be
picked up, then they are a little more in-
clined to bite than a dog and cat would in

Brad Pickle, owner of a pet store in North
Lauderdale.

Pickle said ferrets are no more danger-

, ous than conventional pets.

“I think that 99 percent of the reason
some animals will turn vicious is because
of the way they are raised,” Pickle said.
“My feeling is that most of the animals
are a product of their environment.”

Schlueter and Lani Wigand of the Hu-

among those who warn against making a
pet out of any non-domestic animal.
“Almost every animal in the animal king-

Tougher law limits who kee

seven big cats - two lions, two ti-

 

By PATTI ROTH
Staff Writer

Perhaps it’s the urge for the 2233—
lSlllal. Or the appeal of the ador-
lb e.’

Whatever the reason, some peo-
ple opt for the exotic rather than
Lhe conventional when it comes to
pets.

“You c333 “’lﬂlOSt attribute the
popularity if proportion to adver-

tising ant’ the latest film that
stars some animal,” said Lt.
Charles Dennis, wildlife inspector
for the state Game and Fresh Wa-
ter Fish Commission.

Florida law sets specific guide-
lines on which wild animals can be
kept as pets and by whom.

Steve Sipek, of the Loxahatchee
area in Palm Beach County, has

gers, two leopards and a cougar.

The former movie Tarzan is
among the few Floridians allowed
to keep such dangerous animals as
personal pets. .

The state no longer issues pet
permits for many wild animals, in-
cluding big cats, orangutans, goril-
las and chimpanzees, but Sipek is
allowed to keep his pets because he
had the animals before the law was
strengthened, Dennis said.

And as of May, it became tough-
er to get a pet permit for another
group of potentially dangerous ani-
mals that includes cougars, bob-
cats, ocelots and dwarf crocodiles.

“The majority of people don’t
really understand what they are
getting into” when they get a wild

“They call us a year or two down
the road and say, ‘What can I do
with the pet cougar?’ ”

State permits are not required
for animals such as ferrets, par-
rots, hamsters and rabbits, accord-
ing to the law.

In Broward and Dade counties,-
288 pe0ple have been issued no-cost
pet permits for the group of ani-
mals that includes raccoons and
skunks, said Lt. Jim Huffstodt, of
the state game and fish commis-
sion.

Dennis estimated that about 30
pe0ple in the same area have $100

pet permits for the group of ani- '

mals that includes cougars and
bobcats.

Some animal experts, such as
Dennis Moore of Palm Beach Coun-

think the laws governing wild pets
should be stricter.

Moore, president of the Florida
Animal Control Association, said
many of his colleagues also are
frustrated with the wildlife pet
laws, but the association has not
yet deve10ped an official proposal
for change. 2

But even when permits are re-
quired, some people ignore the law.

“That’s a big problem,” said Maj.
Kyle Hill of the fish and game com-
mission. “They get [the animal]
without authorizaton. They don’t
know what they’re doing. They
don’t know the legal requirements.
They don’t know how to maintain
the animal safely or humanely.”

The skeletal remains of one of 41 wild horses found dead on federal mngeland near Austin, Nev.

 

Range massacre has
Nevada; federal
ofﬁcials on the spot

By Eric Brazil

OFTFEEXAWERSTAFF

“ CARSON CITY, Nev. — The
outlaw gunners who killed more
than 250 wild horses in central Ne-
vada’s outback have put federal
and state ofﬁcials on the spot and
the livestock industry on the defen-
srve. ’

Not even a state as rough-hewn
and ruggedly individualistic as Ne-
vada, where the frontier ethic is
widely admired, can shrug off what
appears to be one of the worst
range massacres since buffalo were
shot almost to extinction a century
ago.

The shooting of wild. horses has
been a chronic, low-level Nevada
problem since the 1971 enactment
of a federal law criminalizing the
killing or harassment of the species.

But “this is something special.
This is not a'case of a herder who
shoots a horse 'to draw coyotes
away,” said Bob Stewart, Nevada
spokesman for the US. Bureau of
Land Management, which has
launched an aggressive investiga-
tion. “It’s exceedingly distressing."

The mustang killing ground is in
roadless sagebrush-and-pinyon
hills on both sides of lonely High-
way 305 between Battle Mountain
and Austin in Lander County,
about 180 miles east of Reno.

There have been three ﬁnds in
the 162-3quare-mile area so far, the
ﬁrst by a helicopter pilot in August.
the last Oct. 1. The 268 horses
found so far appear to have been

killed during the last six. months;
ofﬁcials say.

 

 




 

Many of the dead horses had
their legs folded beneath them, a
' sign that they were dropped in
their tracks. Mustangs that die of
natural causes have their legs out-
stretched, after thrashing around,
i_according to the Bureau of Land
. Management.

P

BLM assessing the situation

And there may be more. To as-
sess the situation, BLM contract
helicopters are overﬂying the 100-
plus areas where wild horses are
known to roam.

Wild-horse advocates fear th

 

 

 

worst. “There’s a feeling out there
that no matter what happens on
the public rangelands, the BLM
will excuse it anyway,” said Dawn
Lappin, executive director of Wild
Horse Organized Assistance.

Nevada Gov. Richard Bryan re-
" turned from an inspection trip to
' the site of the latest kill and
pledged state assistance in the in-
vestigation. He called the shootings
“the product of a sick mind.”

The grisly discoveries have high-
lighted contradictions inherent in
“managing” the wild horse, which,
despite a near-mythic reputation as

a symbol of freedom, has a negative ,

economic value from the viewpoint
of Nevada cattle and sheep herders.

The GOO-plus Nevada stock rais-
ers whose animals -— 500,000 cat-
tle, 96,000 sheep -— graze the public
lands that make up 87 percent of
the state, regard wild horses as un-
wanted competition for food.

Terri Jay, executive director of
‘ Nevada’s Commission for the Pres-
ervation of the Wild Horse in Car-
son City, said cattlemen outgun
wild-horse advocates politically
and intimidate the BLM.

 

‘Deck stacked against horses'

“The state and the county DAs
don’t take it (enforcing state law
protecting wild horses) seriously.
It’s a big joke,” Jay said. “It’s really
tough when you see how far the
deck is stacked against the horses.”

Lappin said Gov. Bryan, despite
his recently expressed concern for
wild horses, seemed to go out of his
way to make the commission on
which she serves ineffective by ap-
pointing to it Deloyd Satterth-
waite, president of the Nevada
Cattlemen’s Association.

Last February, Satterthwaite
denounced a ﬁlm produced by the
commission for romanticizing wild
horses and portraying ranchers “in

a derogatory manner.” The ﬁlm re-
ferred to the poor condition of
some of Nevada’s public rangeland
and low grazing fees. (The state’s
cattle and sheep raisers paid
$2,399,000 in grazing fees in 1987,
according to the BLM.)
Satterthwaite manages Ellison
Ranches of Battle Mountain,

which has a BLM permit to run .

sheep during the winter in the area
where the killings occurred.

In a telephone interview from
Winnemucca, Satterthwaite said
those who are pointing the ﬁnger at
the livestock industry for the kill-
ings have gone off half cocked.

“If in fact those horses were
shot, there are so many people in
the area that to blame the rancher
at this particular time is ridicu-
lous,” he said. “There’s more geolo-
gists running around in the state of
Nevada than there are cattle.”

 

Ranchers blamed last time, too
Satterthwaite noted that the
last incident of high-proﬁle wild-
horse deaths -- 12 shootings in the
Las Vegas area, 43 deaths by stran-
gulation and dehydration in the
Clan Alpine Mountains east of Fal-
lon -— also at ﬁrst were blamed on
ranchers. In fact, two sportsmen

' did the shooting, and the other

deaths were caused by a BLM-
sponsored experiment, Satterth-
waite said. (The sportsmen were
ﬁned $275 each and ordered to per-
form 120 hours of community ser-
vice. Killing or harassing an animal
protected by the 1971 Wild and
Free-Roaming Horse and Burro
Act is as misdemeanor, punishable
by a $2,000 ﬁne or two years in
prison.) '
Satterthwaite, like other stock-
men interviewed, criticized the
BLM as strongly as did wild-horse
advocates, but from a different an-
gle. The BLM “has not been keep-

ing its end of the bargain,” Sat-i.
terthwaite said. “It’s been a strug-
gle to get the BLM to realize that
we agreed to the ’71 (wild) horse
levels, and we’re so much over
those levels that we’ll never get ’em
(the horses) all gathered.”

 

38,000 horses in 10 states

More than 38,000 horses roam
the rangeland in 10 Western states.
including as many as 28,000 in Ne—
vada alone. At the turn of the cen-
tury, there were about 2 million
wild horses in the West. Their
numbers had dwindled to about
17,000 in 1971 when Congress
passed the protection law. '

Henry Filippini Jr. of Reese Riv-
er, who has a permit to graze he
cattle in the mustang kill area, said
he was “appalled” by the magni-
tude of the slaughter, but “all I
know about it is what I read in the
papers.” '

BLM will spend $15.8 million to
manage wild horses nationwide in
1988 —— $2.65 million in Nevada.
where about 5,600 “excess” mus-
tangs will be gathered and put up
for adoption.

Stewart, Nevada’s BLM spokes—
man, bristled at the suggestion that
the long delay before the discovery
of the killings indicated a ﬂaccid
management program. “We have a
pro-active management program,
but we’re talking about horses
spread over 48 million acres.”

Except when it mounts an ex-
ceptional investigation, such as the
one under way. BLM’s Nevada law
enforcement staff consists of just
three agents.

The BLM is being tight-lipped
about the progress of the investiga-
tion.

But Jay, a frequent bureau crit-
ic, said,“They’re gonna get these
guys. Yeah, there’s too much pres-
sure on them not to.”

BIG PROBLEM: Elephants are facing threats from poachers in Africa and handlers who some-
. times use brutal methods.

By Jane Fritsch

The Los Angeles Times

AN DIEGO — Painted and

bejeweled, they parade

through the streets of In-
dia, prodded on by their. proud
mahouts. In the jungles of Asia,
laden with chains, they uproot
trees and trudge miles in the
heat. At zoos and circuses across
the United States, they give rides
to delighted children and kneel
for their trainers.

Throughout history, man has
sought dominance over the ele-
phant and, to most Americans,
they seem agreeable and docile
creatures.

But dominance over the
world’s largest land animal has a
hidden side. Behind the scenes,
elephant handlers sometimes em-
ploy surprisingly brutal methods.
Beating, starvation, electric
shock and, if all else fails, months
or years of lonely isolation are
among the tools used by some el-
ephant handlers to control their
charges.

Now, with herds dwindling in
the wilds of Asia and Africa, the
care and handling of elephants in
captivity is coming under in-
creasing scrutiny. Asian ele-
phants are an endangered spe-
cies, while African elephants are
considered threatened, less ur-
gent but still serious. ‘

Many who study and care for
elephants have come to believe
that the last refuge for the beasts
may be Western zoos and wildlife

, parks, where their hope for sur-

vival rests with fledgling captive
breeding programs.

Whether American elephant
handlers are equipped to assume

' elephant abuse

that role and whether they can
accomplish it humanely are ques-
tions that have stirred consider-
able debate, particularly among
elephant handlers themselves, a
group known as much for its dif-
ferences of opinion as for its
pachyderm-size egos.

“It’s a mess,” said Roland
Smith, assistant director of the
Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma,
Wash. “The basic problem is that
there is no place where anybody
really goes to learn how to work
elephants. We hire keepers and
we give them sticks and we tell
them they’re elephant guys. it

“I believe you can keep 'ele-
phants in captivity without bru-
talizing them; but you have very
few peOple who know what
they’re doing, meaning people
who use their minds. People need
to get together in theme commu-
nity and drop their egos at the
door.”

John Lehnhardt, elephant col-
lection manager at the National
Zoo in Washington, said he thinks
zoos historically have done a
“lousy job” managing elephants.
“I really feel there is no consen-
sus of any kind on how you handle
elephants at zoos.”

The feeling is shared, Lehn-
hardt added, by many of the
trainers and handlers who care .
for the estimated 400 elephants in
North American zoos and another
200 to 300 in the hands of circuses
and private owners. '

In an attempt to impose some
order on the world of elephant-
keeping, .Lehnhardt and others
organized an elephant workshop

 

Please see ELEPHANTS on 2-D

 




 

ETEPHANTS from Page 1-D

eight years ago.

Although still loosely coordinat-
ed, the annual conferences have
brought together circus trainers,
zoo keepers and private owners
who exchange opinions as well as
information.

Over the past eight years, the
level of care at zoos has improved
dramatically, Lehnhardt said, in
part because of the conferences
and in part because zoos have be-
gun to bring in elephant consul-
tants to advise them on care.

Still, some people believe that e1-
ephant keepers should establish
standards for training, feeding, dis-
cipline and medical care and even-
tually the more difficult tasks of
captive breeding.

So far, the handlers have taken
only the first steps toward consen-
sus, agreeing to standardize 15 or

so basic oral commands such as
“no,” “come here,” “down” and
“heel.” Keepers throughout North
America, the conference leaders
hope, will learn the commands and
use them consistently to keep from
confusing the elephants.

High turnover among trainers as
well as elephant trades among
zoos, circuses and private owners
make it unlikely that an elephant
will be in the care of the same per-
son for more than a few years.

Keepers blame the high turn-
over within their ranks on the dan-
ger and unpleasantness of the job
as well as on pay levels that begin
around $12,000 and rarely go higher
than $25,000 a year.

The touchy subject of discipline
has been raised at the annual
workshops.

All but the most fervent animal
rights activists agree that ele-
phants must undergo some physi-

cal discipline if they are to live in
captivity.

Most zoo elephants are females,
which are more malleable than
males; but many zoos, especially
those with breeding programs,
keep one or more bull elephants to
ensure a diverse gene pool.

necessary for the welfare of

both the elephants and their
handlers, keepers say.

Common causes of death among
captive elephants are complica-
tions resulting from foot infections
that went untreated because keep-
ers were unable to approach the
animals.

And there are numerous in-
stances of keepers being killed or
maimed by captive elephants that
got out of control. A survey by the
San Diego Zoo found that two keep-
ers at American zoos and one in

IN CAPTIVITY, discipline is

England have been killed by ele
phants since 1981 and many han-
dlers injured.

Most keepers agree on the uSe of
the ankus or “elephant hook,”
light baton with a steel hook at one
end. The hooked end is used to
guide an elephant’ 5 foot and the
blunt end can be used to strike the
elephant, usually on the head,
where the skull is thick and, the
keeper can get a point across with-
out inflicting injury.

There is little agreement, how-
ever, on the use of more severe
measures, such as sustained beat-
ings with ax handles or other in-
struments.

“Elephants are real dangerous,”
said Lehnhardt. “If you’re going to
manage them well in captivity,
you’ve got to give them discipline.
The question is where to draw the
line between effective discipline
and abuse.”

UJUMBURA, Burundi —

tainers filled with elephant
tusks stand 1n the dusty courtyard
of the central police station, a
monument of sorts to the ivory
trade and to the elephants it
threatens with extinctibn.

International wildlife authorié
ties were given a rare window on
the business a year ago when a
new president took power in Bu-
rundi and, as one of his first acts,
shut down the then-legal ivory
trade, ordering the stocks of local
traders seized.

The dealers, mostly foreigners,
had 80 tons of tusks on hand,
nearly all destined for Hong Kong
and Singapore.

Bank records revealed that the
ivory dealers had been paying
government duties on about 200
tons of ivory a year -— worth at

least $25 million. An additional 100
tons probably passed through the
country illegally, according to’
former ivory dealers in Burundi.

With a mature elephant ac-
counting for about 22 pounds of
ivory, that total would represent
about 27,000 dead elephants a
year.

“Burundi is surrounded by
countries that have elephants but
forbid the export of ivory,” said a
former ivory dealer. “When ship-
ping ivory was legal here, this
naturally became a hub.”

But, he added, “it had to end

. sometime.”

That was the closest any of the
former dealers would come to ad-
mitting complicity in the extermi-
nation of vast numbers of ele-
phants. Africa’s elephant
population has declined from 1.5
million to 750,000 in the past de-
cade.

Grim Harvest ‘

We build plastic to last. NoWit’s Coming back to haunt us.

 

BY MICHA El WEISSKOPF

 

t is dawn on the Gulf of Mexico, nature’s

rush hour. Sunbathers and pleasure

boaters, sleeping off the arid heat of
July, haven’t yet descended on the shore. All
along the water’s edge, seabirds strut and
dive for fish, while ghost crabs and ground
squirrels scurry for food. But this morning
there’s a human intrusion. A large, bearded
man slowly drives a tan pickup truck down
the beach, his right hand gripping the steer-
ing wheel, his left continuously punching a
portable computer to record what the tide
brought in.

As Tony Amos jabs computer keys pro
grammed for the most common discoveries,
he rattles off the items in the staccato tone
of an inventory clerk:

“Plastic bottle, plastic bottle, plastic
bag, Styrofoam, plastic glove, plastic lids,
foam packaging, plastic rope, plastic pro
duce sack, Karo syrup jug, six-pack ring,
another glove, Styrofoam cup, cup, plastic
bag, plastic fishing line, plastic bleach bot-
tle, plastic egg carton, piece of plastic net,
50-pound plastic bag of sea salt, ,Bic lighter.

“More synthetic gloves — this is going
to be a world record glove day. . . . Here’s an
interesting plastic bottle, mineral water
made in France. There’s a Mexican bleach, a
green bottle. You see a lot of them. . . Oh
God, more gloves.”

Finally he brakes and gets out to inspect
a specimen for which there is a special com-
puter key designated “dead.” A Moot-long
redfish, its scales shimmering in the sunthas
washed ashore. The fish is ringed tightly by
a black plastic gasket, which has caused a
deep gash and eroded the gills. Apparently,
months earlier, the fish had darted into the
gasket, which had lodged behind its gill cov-
er. As the fish grew, the plastic ring became
a noose, damaging the gills and thus eventu-
ally cutting off the animal 5 supply of oxy-
gen.

Amos has come to expect such casual-
ties. An oceanographer at the University of
Texas Marine Science Institute, who has
combed the same 7% miles of beach every
other day for 10 years, he is one of a growing
number of scientists who are documenting
plastic pollution of the ocean and its perils
for the creatures that live there.

The thousands'of plastic objects that
Amoslogs in during every sweep of Mustang
Island’s beach represent a tiny fraction of
the debris floating a few miles off the Texas
shore. And the problem extends far beyond
the gulf. Throughout the world, important
water bodies -— especially the oceans -—
have become virtual waste bins for the tons
of plastic products dumped daily by com-
mercial fishermen, military vessels, mer-
chant ships, passenger liners, pleasure boats,
offshore oil and gas drilling operations, the
plastics industry and sewage treatment

plants.

 

The author, a staff writer for the Washington
Post, has been covering the issue of marine plas-
tic pollution for the past several years. @ l 988
Smithsonian magazine.

‘ No one knows how much plastic pollut-
es the seas. In 1975, the National Academy of
Sciences estimated that 7 million tons of
garbage are dumped into the world’s oceans
every year. There was no overall breakdown
for plastics, but the academy itemized trash
from several specific sources. Measured in
terms of weight, less than 1 percent of that
litter was categorized as plastic. But some
experts believe such findings greatly under-
state the problem because plastic is so much
lighter than other debris. The production of
plastics has more than doubled sinCe 1975.
Plastic softdrink bottles, for instance, were
not introduced until the late ’70s This dra—
matic increase is reflected in more recent
studies of marine debris. A 1985 report esti-
mated that merchant ships dump 450, 000

al waters.

As with all revolutions, however, there
is a “tradecff,” as Ronald Bruner, of the
Society of the Plastics Industry, described it.

' The very durability of the synthetic has

created a massive disposal problem, espe
cially in the marine environment, where
seagoers traditionally unload their domestic
wastes and gear. Whereas other materials

degrade relatively quickly or sink to the .
bottom, plastic persists. Buoyant, it floats on ,

birds, seals, sea lions and sea otters, and
hundreds of whales, dolphins, porpoises and

animals struggling to survive, "said David
Lasit, senior policy and program analyst for
the US. Marine Mammal Commission. “But
those dangers are concentrated in one place.
With plastic pollution, it's a different situa-
tion Plastics are like individual mines float-
ing arOund the ocean just waiting for vic-
tims.”

Until only recently, no laws have specif-
ically prohibited ocean disposal and dump
ing of plastics. As a result, vessels worldwide
have made the ocean their home -- and
their dumping grounds, disposing of wastes
with a wantonness that never would be per-
mitted on land. Joe Cox, of the American
Institute of Merchant Shipping, explained
the rationale for dumping: “You go weeks

lastic’s devastating effect on an en-

tire population of marine animals

was first observed in the late 19703.
The victims were the northern fur seals of
the Pribilof Islands, which are located in the
Bering Sea west of Alaska. Scientists from
the National Marine Mammal Laboratory (a
division of the National Marine Fisheries
Service) found that, beginning in 1976, the
seal population was declining at the rate of 4
percent to 6 percent annually. They conclud-
ed that plastic entanglement was killing up
to 40,000 seals 3 year.

Naturally curious, the mls were play-
ing with fragments of plastic netting or
packaging straps floating in the water, often
catching their necks in the webbing, accord-
ing to Charles Fowler,an NMML biologist
who visits the islands every summer during
mating season. The debris can constrict a
5831's movement, preventing normal feed-
ing. Unable to eXtricate itself, the animal
eventually drowns, starves to death, or dies
of exhaustion or infection from deep
wounds caused by the tightening of the ma-
terial around its back and neck. Many seal
pups grow into the plastic collars, which

tighten as their necks thicken. In time, says

Fowler, the plastic severs the seal’s arteries
and strangles it.

Fowler says that often more than one
seal can become entangled in the same piece
of netting. He once came upon a mother and
pup whose necks were ringed that way. “Ev-
ery time the mother moved ” the biologist
recalled, “she dragged the pup along with
her. It was a pathetic sight. "

Whales are also among the victims.
They sometimes lunge for schools of fish
and surface with netting caught in their
mouths or wrapped around their heads and
tails. A whale dragging hundreds of feet of
net may be unable to eat. The extra weight
impedes the whales movements and can
exhaust it. Beached whales have been found
on both the East and West coasts, their bod-
ies emaciated and entangled in plastic net.
In the fall of 1982, a humpback whale tan-
gled in 50 to 100 feet of net washed up on a
Cape Cod beach. It was starving and so thin
that his ribs were showing. “In a couple of
hours the animal was so weak it simply
died.“ said Phil Clapham, research director
at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provin-
cetown. “At that point, it had been digesting
its stomach.”

In the past four years, Clapham’s center
has received reports of entanglement of
about 20 humpbacks, an endangered species
with not more than 8,000 survivors in the
North Atlantic. Twelve were dangerously
ensnared; two eventually died. The center
mounts rescue efforts to save entangled
whales. One success story involves a 25mm
female humpback, which staffers called Ibis
because a line under her tail suggested the
long, curved bill of that elegant bird. A
playful, friendly whale that swam near
boats in the early 19805, she was a favorite of
scientists and whale watchers along the New
England coast.

In the summer of 1984 Ibis got entan-
gled in 500 feet of net. She was briefly seen
in October, and then not spotted again. Ex-
perts at the center feared she had drowned
But on Thanksgiving Day, Ibis, very thin,
tired and still badly entangled, appeared
just outside Provincetown Harbor. Crews in
inflatable boats approached her and manag-
ed to book a rope onto the tangled net. The
rope was attached to buoyant floats, which

After trying to submerge a few times,
Ibis gave up. She simply lay on the water’s
surface, allowing the rescuers to pull the net
out of her mouth and off her tail.‘Freed in

later set forth to her winter migration. A
healthy whale returned the following May.
and by June 1986, Ibis was swimming with a
calf. “A lot of champagne was flowing
among the whale scientists on the East
Coast." recalled Clapham.

Such happy endings are rare for the
victims of plastic entanglement. Along Flori-
da‘s coasts, brown pelicans diving for fish
sometimes go for fishermen’s bait and get
hooked. Sport fishermen will usually cut the
line, thinking the pelican will then be free.
But the line is a killer. Sometimes the syn-
thetic wraps so tightly around the bird‘s feet
and wings that these limbs atr0phy. More

often. the lines snag branches of the squat,

gnarled mangrove trees clustered on the

islands where the birds traditionally roost.

“Then the birds just hang there until
they're skeletons.“ said Ralph Heath. who
runs a seabird rescue mission near St. Pe-
tersburg. “They don‘t last long once they’re
suspended from the tree limbs. They can’t
bite the line loose. They can‘t shake it loose.
So they keep thrashing until they die."

Cruising Boca Ciega Bay in a 24-foot
motorboat, Heath anchors near a mangrove
island owned by the sanctuary. He is looking
for injured birds. An assistant hurls Spanish
sardines into the water, luring dozens of
pelicans from the rookery. Heath spots a
bird with a bloody wing and scoops it up
with a net. A piece of fishing line is wound
around its flank, deeply etching its humerus
and cutting into tissue. Heath carefully dis
entangles the bird and returns it to the
water. “If it wraps any tighter, it acts like a
tourniquet and cuts off circulation," he ex-
plained. “Once that happens. it‘s all over."

Heath has found pelican chicks dead in
their nests, strangled by hundreds of feet of
fishing line that had probably been dragged
there by their parents. He has seen pelicans
garroted by plastic six-pack rings -- includ-
ing one with a fish stuck in its throat, held
there firmly by the plastic yoke. -

In small shapes and sizes, plastic resem-
bles the food supply of some marine crea~
tures. But it is dangerous to consume. Sea-
birds, mistaking spherical resin pellets (the
raw material used to manufacture plastic
products) for fish eggs and other natural
food, suffer intestinal blockage and ulcera-
tion. Whales also are victims of plastic inges
tion. On New Year’s Day 1984, an infant
pygmy sperm whale beached itself along-
side its dying mother on Galveston Island in
the Gulf of Mexico. Named Lafitte after a
French pirate who had once landed there,
the calf was taken to an aquarium and nurs-
ed. Lafitte seemed to be healthy. eating
some squid and diving playfully in the hold-
ing tank. Suddenly he stopped eating, and
on January 11, he died. Dr. Raymond Tar-
pley, a Texas A&M University veterinarian.
participated in the necropsy. The conclu-
sion: Lafitte had died of severe infection of
the abdominal cavity lining. In the animal's
stomach he found, among other items, a
30gallon plastic garbage-can liner, a plastic
bread wrapper and a com—chip bag.

Most worrisome is the danger of plastic
to indiscriminate eaters such as ocean tur-
tles, especially hatchlings that spend their
early lives at sea surviving off surface organ-
isms. To a turtle, says zoologist George Bal-
azs of the National Marine Fisheries Service
in Honolulu, a transparent plastic bag or
particle can look like a jellyfish, plankton or
the larval stage of a crab. Once in the turtle’s
intestines, he adds, the indigestible material
can block fecal matter, prevent assimilation
of nutrients and make the turtle too buoyant
to dive for food. It is gruesome —~ but true --
that dead turtles with plastic bags and fish-
ing line extending from both ends have
been found in the Gulf of Mexico, in the
Hawaiian Islands and along the East Coast.

In a way, the marine plastic pollution
problem crept up on American lawmakers.
While several international conventions and
federal laws have included provisions to lim-
it or prohibit marine dumping of chemicals,
oil and other substances, none of them has
applied directiy to the more recently recog-
nized problem of plastic debris. The 1973
International Convention for the Preven-
tion of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) con-
tained an annex (Annex Vt that would pro-

hibit ocean disposal of plastics, limit other
garbage disposal and require ports to pro
vide facilities for receiving trash from in-
coming ships. But that annex needed sepa-
rate ratification and it languished, lacking
the requisite number of signatory nations to
become international law. The holdouts in-
cluded the United States '

A key turning point occurred in 1984.
when a conference on marine debris was
held in Honolulu under the auspices of the
National Marine Fisheries Service (a division
of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmo
spheric Administration). That meeting
brought into focus the scope of the problem
and led to the founding of NOAA’s Marine
Entanglement Research Program. It also
mobilized governmental agencies and envi-
ronmental groups to push for ratification of
Annex V.

In the wake of that conference, Con-
gress was urged by the Coast Guard, the
Marine Mammal Commission, NOAA and
numerous environmental groups to ratify
the annex. Finally, in the last week of 1987,
the United States completed its'ratification
process, making Annex V effective.

Beginning December 31, it will be illegal
for ships registered in signatory nations, and
all other ships within the waters of those
countries that prohibit dumping, to discard
plastics in the ocean.

But Kathleen O’Hara, a marine biologist
and plastics specialist for the Center for
Environmental Education, points out that
although the annex will help, it will by no
means solve‘the problem. It only deals with
ocean disposal, for one thing, ignoring pollu-
tion from such land sources as sewage treat-
ment plants and plastics manufacturers. In
addition, nations not party to the annex
don‘t have to adhere to its conditions unless
their ships are in the waters of party nations.

There is the additional problem of mili-
tary vessels, which are exempt from Annex
V. American warships alone discharge four
tons of plastic every day, says Larry Koss,
environmental program manager for the
US. Navy‘s shipboard program. While US.
military vessels are being required by Con-
gress to comply with the Annex V within
five years, each signatory nation will be
handling this question independently. Koss

says the Navy is exploring the idea of a
special thernzul waste processor for plastics
that will compact large loads of the synthet-
ic trash into small bricks that can be more
easily stored and carried by ships to port.

he plastics industry, as well, is address-
I ing the problem of plastics disposal.
One spotlight is turned on degradable
plastics; the technology for some types is
already in place and research continues for
wider and appropriate applications. Several
companies now offer degradable resins for
sale. and a few manufacturers in the United
States. Italy and Canada are making degrade
able plastic bags. A photodegradable agri-
cultural mulch has been available for sever-
al years. and to comply with laws in 11 states.
manufacturers have developed six-pack
rings that also break down in sunlight.

There has been some progress, too, in
the area of recycling. Plastics industry
sources say that. in this country, 20 percent
of all plastic soft drink bottles arebeing
recycled into items like polyfill stuffing.
paintbrushes and industrial strapping. Tech-
nology also is available for “commingled”
recycling — mixing different types of plas
tics in the recycling process — and that

' process is now being used to produce a new

building material called plastic lumber.

Elephants
in Captivity:

SAN DIEGO—Painted and “be-

Asia, laden with chains, they up-
lroot trees and trudge miles in the

Throughout history, man has

3 .atures. ,
( rEI‘Sut dominance over the Earth 5
largest land animal has a hidden
side. Behind the scenes, elephant
handlers sometimes employ sur-
prisingly brutal methods. Beatings,
starvation, electric shock and, if all
else fails, months or years of isola-
tion are among the tools used by
some elephant handlers to control
the animals.

Dwindling Numbers

Now, with herds dwindling in
the wilds of Asia and Africa, the
care and handling of elephants in
captivity is coming under increas-
ing scrutiny. Asian elephants are
a: i endangered species, while Afri-
cain elephants are conSidered
threatened. a less urgent but still

- sc -rious classification. ,

elephants have come to believe

'Whether American elephant

tions that have stirred conSiderable

zoos and another 200 to 300 in the
hands of circuses and other private
owners. In an attempt to impose

some order on the world of elephant keeping,
Lehnhardt and others organized their first annual
elephant workshop eight yearsago.

Although still loosely coordinated, the conferences
for the first time have brought together circus trainers,
zookeepers and private owners who exchange opinions
as well as information. This year, the workshop will be
held in December in Jacksonville, Fla.

Over the last eight years, the level of care at zoos has
improved dramatically, Lehnhardt said, in part be-
cause of the conferences and in part because zoos have
begun to bring in elephant consultants to advise them
on care.

Still, the conferences have been a disappointment to
some who believe elephant keepers should establish
standards for training, feeding, discipline and medical
care and eventually the more difficult tasks of captive
breeding.

So far, the handlers have taken only the first steps
toward consensus, agreeing to standardize 15 or so
basic verbal commands such as “No,” “Come here,”
“Down” and “Heel.” Keepers throughout North
America, the conference leaders hope, will learn the
commands and use them consistently to keep from
confusing the elephants. High turnover among trainers
as well as elephant trades among zoos, circuses and
private owners make it unlikely that an elephant will
be in the care of the same person for more than a few
years.

The keepers themselves are a disparate lot who are
not reluctant to express contempt for each other.
“There’s kind of an old saying,” said keeper Jim

‘ Sanford of the Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore.

“ ‘You can’t get any two of them to agree on anything
except what the third guy is doing wrong.’ ” ‘

Source of Experience
Many elephant keepers are former carnival hands

big top of major circuses, or, more recently, at
young graduate students and miscellaneous zoo em-

been driving the tour bus at the zoo.
“N obody teaches Elephant 101,” Sanford said. “If

you want to do it, you just start hanging around with

people who do it.”

 




,_ Ir:w captivity, discipline is necessary for the welfare of
both the elephants and their handlers, keepers say. A
common cause of death among captive elephants is
complications resulting from foot infections that went
untreated because keepers were unable to approach
the animals. -
And there are numerous instances of keepers being
killed or maimed by captive elephants that got out of
control. According to a survey by the San Diego Zoo,
two keepers at American zoos and one in England have
been killed by elephants since 1981 and many handlers
have been injured. In 1983, an elephant at Lion
Country Safari in Laguna Hills attacked and killed the
park’s chief zoologist, and last year, an elephant at the
Ft. Worth [Texas] Zoo attacked and killed a keeper
there.
On Saturday, Gail Hedberg, a veterinary technician
at the San Francisco Zoo, was attacked while

fidence in Tinkerbelle, who had attacked a

attempting to treat an abscess on an elephant’s head.
Tinkerbelle, a 22-year-old female, became angry
during the treatment and did a “handstand” on

‘ Hedberg, who suffered a broken pelvis, a zoo spokes-
man said.

One keeper expressed sympathy for Tinkerbelle,
saying she has been abused by handlers who are trying
to get her to perform tricks for the public. Paul Hunter,
a keeper at the zoo for nine years, said Monday that the
abscess was caused by a blow with a hooked
instrument called an ankus.

“They are trying to turn these elephants into circus
performers,” Hunter said. “You have to motivate them

‘ and the way you do that is by beating the hell out of

: them. Sometimes keepers lose their tempers.”

g Saul Kitchener, director of the San Francisco Zoo,

; said Monday that Tinkerbelle has never been abused
and that other keepers at the zoo are angry with

1 Hunter. “They are very professional keepers who

‘ attend all the elephant workshops,” Kitchener said.

The zoo does not permit keepers to strike elephants

with the hooked end of the ankus, he added.

f Most keepers agree on the use of the ankus or
elephant hook, a light baton with a steel hook on one
end. The hooked end is used to guide an elephant’s foot
and the blunt end can be used to strike the elephant,
usually on the head, where the skull is thick and the

, keeper can get his point across without inflicting

injury. There is little agreement, however, on the use

‘ of more severe measures, such as sustained beatings
with ax handles or other instruments.

“Elephants are real dangerous,” Lehnhardt said. “If
you’re going to manage them well in captivity, you’ve
got to give them discipline. The question is, ‘Where do
you draw the line between effective discipline and
abuse?’ ”

There is no easy answer to that question, a lesson
learned recently in a bitter dispute that divided
keepers at the world-renowned San Diego Zoo and its
sister institution, the San Diego Wild Animal Park. The

San Diego incident and several investigations that
followed provided a rare opportunity for the public to
get a behind-the-scenes look at measures sometimes
taken to control elephants, measures that many public
relations-conscious zoo administrators would prefer to
keep private. _
The incident involved an 18-year-old female Afri-
can elephant called Dunda, which was transferred last
February from the zoo, where she had spent most of
her life, to the Wild Animal Park, where she was to
become part of a breeding herd. .
According to keepers at the zoo, Dunda’s new
keepers chained her legs, pulled her to the ground, and
beat her on the head with ax handles during several
sessions over two days. One of the five participants
described the blows to San Diego Humane Society
investigators as “home run swings.” , .
Officials of the Zoological Society of San Diego,
which operates both institutions, have said they
believe the beatings were an appropriate method of
disciplining a dangerous animal, but Dunda’s former
keepers at the zoo criticized the sessions as unneces-
sary and brutal, and a veterinarian at the park has told
investigators he thinks the institution owes the public
an apology. .
Several investigations of the incident have produced
conflicting results, reflecting the confusion that eXists
among people who consider themselves experts. The ,
San Diego Humane Society and the San Diego city
attorney’s office cOncluded that there was 1nsuff1c1ent
evidence to prosecute anyone on animal cruelty
charges, but the Humane Society of the United States
called the incident a clear case of abuse. ‘The US.
Department of Agriculture is now looking into the
matter and the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums is investigating the incident to see if the
group’s ethics code was violated.
It is not clear whether sessions such as the one at the
Wild Animal Park are common at American zoos, but
nearly all of about 20 zookeepers interviewed by The

 

 




Times said they either know of or had witnessed far

more serious incidents in their years of elephant _

keeping.
‘ Electric Shocks

Dale Tuttle, executive director of the Jacksonville
(Fla) Zoological Park, is among a number of keepers
who said they have heard of incidents during which
keepers at zoos soaked recalcitrant elephants with
water and then applied 110- or 220-volt electric
current to them. Those who use electric shock will
rarely admit it, Tuttle said, adding that he had never
witnessed such an incident and that he and many other
keepers object strongly to the practice.

Tuttle said electric shock infuriates elephants and
that the idea of “juicing an animal that’s chained and
can’t run away” is not acceptable.

Elephant. handlers frequently complain, he added,
that “nobody cares about what we do and nobody
listens to what we say.” The situation may improve if
elephant handlers organize, possibly through the
annual workshops, and present a united front to zoo
directors as well as the public, he said. ‘

“Elephants have traditionally not done well at zoos
until this decade,” Tuttle said. He said he believes that
there are a number of young people in the field who
have an intense interest in elephants and their welfare.
The future care and protection of the animals rests

with those concerned young people, he believes.

Most elephants are likely to fare better in American
zoos today than did the infamous rogue Ziggy, an Asian
male that spent nearly 30 years chained in an elephant

barn at the Brookfield Zoo outside Chicago.

Named for Broadway producer Florenz Ziegfeld,
who purchased the elephant and brought it to the

United States, Ziggy arrived at Brookfield around 1940.
For more than a year after his arrival, no one was able
to approach him and unchain him.

He was liberated in 1941 by the late Slim Lewis, a
well-known handler who exemplified what some

Henneous said.

Washington Park does not use
the crush to deal with its female
elephants, which are generally
easier to handle, Henneous said.
Instead, firm discipline and behav-
ior modification are used. “Training
is mutual understanding and trust."
Henneous said. “There’s as much
variation in the animals as there is
in people. You’ve got to know the
animal well enough to be able to
read it.” Elephants are highly in-
telligent and social animals that
crave contact with other elephants
or people, he ‘said.

“It physically prevents him from

keepers call the old-school style of elephant handling. .

Lewis joined the staff of the Brookfield Zoo in 1941 to
take on the challenge of “breaking” Ziggy, an animal
he described as “the meanest elephant alive in

to beating. There are certainly
heavy-handed types who, for lack
of skill or imagination, will reSort to

America today.”

At 10 feet tall and 13,000 pounds, Ziggy was “one of
the biggest, most devilish, wild-eyed monsters I ever
had laid eyes on,” Lewis wrote in his book, “I Loved
Rogues—The Life of an Elephant Tramp.” .

During a hair-raising session in the elephant barn,
Lewis succeeded in “breaking” Ziggy, beating on him
“in a fury.” After 15 minutes, Ziggy was “lying on his
side on the floor,” Lewis wrote. '

Lewis described the exhilaration he felt “after
hearing the sigh of a mighty bull elephant that has
given in and acknowledged you as both his master and
his protector. It’s a thrill that comparatively few of us,
at least in America, have had.” ‘

But within months Ziggy tried to kill Lewis, who
narrowly escaped. Ziggy was locked inside a barn and

largely forgotten by the public for the next 30 years, ~

until a new director was brought to the zoo and a new
outdoor facility and moat were constructed. For his
last four years, Ziggy was handled from a distance. He
died in 1975 at the age of 58, after falling into a moat.
Despite his unnatural living conditions, Ziggy had a life
span typical of elephants in the wild.

Few zookeepers would attempt to handle or break a
bull elephant today.

“We never go in with our male elephants," said
Sanford, of the Washington Park Zoo, which has three
male elephants used in a breeding program.

“When male Asian elephantsgo into musth [a
condition associated with establishing dominance and
mating], they become extremely aggressive. Thei‘
hormone levels rise tremendously and they becom<

' no-win situation. It’s a ‘Gotcha.

7”

Roger Henneous, lead elephant
keeper at the Washington Park

Zoo, helped design the crush eight
a” years ago. He said he knows of no
% other American zoo using the de—
. vice. “I’ll be damned if I understand
:3; why,” Henneous said. “Every work
' camp in Asia has a crude timber

version of this.”
The Portland Zoo has received a

"number of inquiries about the
“crush, “but when you start talking

dollars, people hear their momma
calling,” Henneous said.

Keepers in' Portland came up
with the idea after a bull elephant

died of cardiac arrest after surgery

to treat a foot infection.
“We lost the most prolific Asian

male the zoo world has ever known

{because you couldn’t treat
;.chronic foot rot,” Henneous said.
The elephant had produced 15

'f‘pffspring in captivity before it died

‘at the age of 27. Currently, Wash-
ington Park, with 24 live births, has
the most successful captive breed—
:ing program among American zoos,

“There’s a depressing number of
the wrong kind of people attracted
to elephant keeping, people with a
macho attitude . who think
they’re 9 feet tall and bulletproof. I
always like to start out low key, the
soft sell, and get across to [the
elephants] that this is going to
happen and it’s going to get even
more unpleasant. . . .You develop
a trust with them,” Henneous said.

“New people, they want to start
out World War III and nuke ’em till
they glow.”

Henneous, 51, a keeper for 20
years, says he is a prime example of
the way people become elephant
keepers.

“I just wandered in off the
streets. I don’t know of anybody in
the years that I’ve been in the
business who ever set out to be an
elephant keeper. It’s something.
more often than not, that people
stumble into and become intrigued
with.

“There have been times in my
life when I’ve said, ‘Why didn‘t 1
take up bunny rabbits or canar-
ies‘?’ ”

Startling numbers of Cali-
fornia. sea lions are being strick-
en with a new and mysterious
malady marked by sometimes
violent seizures and extreme
lethargy.

A few of the animals suffered
seizures so severe that they bit their
teeth off. Marine mammal experts
are warning people to keep their
distance and call for help if they
come upon a sick sea lion.

‘ ;So far, 28 of the stricken crea-
tures have been discovered, mostly
on southern beaches. They have
been trucked to the California Ma-
rine Mammal Center at Fort Cronk-
hite in Marin County.

Mary Jane Schramm of the cen-
ter said workers there have never
seen such an outbreak. It is testing

dition sets off similar convulsions.
Also, “Debbie,” one of the eight sea
lions that have died, had veryhigh

levels of lead in its body, said
Schramm.

The animals are also being test-
ed for arsenic, cadmium, copper,
iron, zinc and molybdenum, a me-
tallic element used to toughen steel
alloys. An additional test is being
designed to search for natural tox-
ins or other compounds in the food
chain.

Twenty of the sick marine
mamn‘aa‘és were found on the San
Luis Obispo County coast.

“That is an area where there is
oil exploration going on,” said
Schramm. “We cannot say whether
that is a cause, but it certainly is a
factor to consider.”

The other sick sea lions were
found scattered as far north as San-
ta Cruz.

Some of the sea lions are suffer~
ing severe “grand mal” seizures for
hours at a time and have weakened
and died in the process.

_ The first sick sea lion was a

pregnant female who came to the
center on April 30, Schramm said,
suffering seizures so strong that vet-i

; erinarians had to perform an emer.

gency Caesarean section, the first
such operation performed on a sea
lion of which the center is aware.

The mother, called Theda Bara,
died as she was being stitched up,
but the'pup, named Tuesday, was
saved and is doing fine.

Meanwhile, the center is pack- 1

ed with California sea lions suffer-

ing from a surprise outbreak of lep-
tospirosis, a disease that knocks out
the liver and other internal organs.
Since June 1, 105 sea lions have been
diagnosed with “lepto,” Schramm
said, and more than half have died.

The epidemic, which usually
occurs in 10year cycles, came as a
shock to marine mammal experts
this year —— hitting six years earlier
than expected. In 1984, an estimated
8 to 10 percent of the sea lion popu-
lation died from the disease.

“While we cannot make a defi-
nite tiein between pollution and
any of the problems we’re seeing in
the sea lion population,” Schramm
said, studies have shown that pollu-
tion can weaken an animal’s im-
mune system, making it harder to
resist disease.

The embargo will be imple3

did not provide evidence that they
are catching tuna in accordance
with US. regulations aimed at re-
ducing the accidental killing of por-
poises, the department said.

The value of yellowfin tuna im-
ported from the four countries last
year was almost $30 million. Total
imports of all tuna to the United
States were worth $457 million last
year. About 20 percent of that was
yellowfin.

Yellowfin tuna, found in the
eastern tropical Pacific, tend to
swim with porpoises. When fisher~
men get both tuna and porpoises in
their nets, the porpoises can be-
come trapped and drown.

Since 1981, the United States
has set a limit of 20,500 porpoises
that could be accidentally killed

Dog days i
in the
. office

By Carol Stocker
. _ Globe Staff

on can work like a dog, but

don’t try bringing your dog

to work — unless you’re the
1 boss. .

Dog lovers report that
through the more casual
19605 and 19705 pets were

tolerated by a few work places. But in to-
day’s dog—eat-dog world, most of us spend
our time sitting in high-rise office build—
ings and rush-hour traffic while our pets
pine for us at home.

There are still, however. a few individ-
uals who bring their dogs to work with
them. Not surprisingly. these people often
run their own companies.

Or the country.

Bringing your dog to the office is a sign
of power in status-conscious Washington.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole brings
his schnauzer, appropriately named Lead-
er. to his congressional offices “nearly ev—
ery day.” according to Ruth Komarek, a
Dole aide whose duties include walking
the dog. “He’s a good boy.” she said of the
canine Leader. “But he‘s not a good cam-
paigner. He doesn’t like airplanes.”

‘And there’s Alice, who belongs to
House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Wash—
ington, and Peppe Pepper, owned by Rep.
Claude Pepper of Florida. Peppe spends a
lot of time guarding the office orange juice
machine, according to Roll Call, a Wash-
ington weekly that recently ran a series
' on Capitol Hill canines.

In Boston. Watson Bartholomew El-
drich. a black Sheepdog. enjoys a water—
front view in his own downtown office.
"It’s worth a fortune!” said his master, a
developer located in a new Congress Street

penthouse. “If I didn’t own part of the
’ building, I’d probably be hassled by the
landlord. But please don’t use my name —
. if my business associates know I bring my
crazy dog to work with me. they’d think
I’m whacko.” ,

. Gloucester artist Celia Finberg brought

her dog to the classes she taught at Endi-.

, cott College and to her studio office at Har—
vard when she was a fellow there. “If you

 

can find ajob “-s an artist. you can
probably f ind a job you car. take a
dog to. ‘M artists and dogs
have abo the same status in so—
ciety." she drolly observed.

Graphic designer Felice Re-
gan's Chinese pug. Puggy. has a
desk drawer for his bed in Regan‘s
new studio in Somerville's Brick—
bottom Artists Building. the large
visual artists’ cooperative that
opened in April. Another Chinese

sometimes comes to play.

“i take Puggy everywhere 1 go."

said Regan. "He’s very portable."

She used to smuggle him aboard
the bus to Woods Hole in a picnic
basket. “One time he started snor—
ing and l had to pretend to be
asleep. Pugs snore quite loudly."
Edith Loring's fine arts restor-
ation business in Brookline. Lor-

iing Thomas, lnc.. is filled with

painted furniture and gilt frames
awaiting restoration. But in one
corner. there are also toys for her
dogs Jupiter and Diva. In addition
to a green security blanket. they
have a stuffed moose and a couple

I of rubber balls which. Loring
= stressed. are rolled - "never

“ tossed" —- in the antique-filled
, workshop.

Loring believes that. if you
can't take your dog to work with

~ you. it‘s best to have two dogs so
- they can keep each other com-
-. pany. "People think two dogs are
} more work than one. but i find
1 they‘re less work because they

 

' need less attention. A dog that’s
‘. left home alone all day must get

very lonely. When you come home
at the end of the day. it's all over
you like a rash. And if it chewed
the furniture. 1 wouldn‘t blame
it.”

Psychiatric social worker Do-
tO’Halloran says dogs “can take
the formality out of the workplace.
1 think it‘s a wonderful idea if oth-

' er people don‘t mind.”

She used to bring her sheep-
dog-terrier Max with her when
she was director of the Martha’s

Vineyard Mental Health‘Clinic
(Now the Island Counseling Cen-
ter'. it has since banned dogs.) "I
didn’t use him in a deliberate way
— i just didn‘t like leaving him
home alone — but. he helped create
a more nonthreatening atmo-
sphere. Max used to sit in the
waiting room sometimes and peo-
ple who had never gone to therapy
would find it relaxing to have this
little dog come up and wag his
tale. sit down and wait to be pet-
ted." O’Halloran said.

Other therapists would some-
times ”borrow” Max. especially if
they were working with children.

a oran sa 0. Very young i s
can often talk more easily about
dogs and pets than about what's
going on in the family."

Paula Bennet. a writer who
lives in Lincoln. took her dog to
the literature class she taught at
Northeastern University because

. he was sick. “I wanted to spend as

much time with him as I could. So
ljust brought him in. and nobody
said ‘don’t.' Night classes are
somewhat informal. Everybody

' knew him and knew the story. I

got a tremendous amount of sup-

" port. My students were all rooting

.' for him to make it. But he didn't.”

Security Is an obvious reason
some people take dogs to work.

' ”l’ve had some incidents where l

was glad the dogs were here." said
Linda Lecoq. who runs John M.
Lecoq Real Estate on Marlborough-
Street with her husband. ”1 had a .
man — a street person — walk in
and point a gun at my head. i had
another German shepherd at the

= time and he got out from under

my desk and got. between us while
I called the police. It turned out to
be a starter pistol but it was still
scary." -
Lecoq also believes that pets

are good for business. When she
' exercises the dogs by the Charles
; River she meets other dog walkers
who ,are sometimes looking for
apartments that accept pets.
“They find out we manage rental

properties. so they know we like
dogs and will help them. But it's
hard. There are so few people that
will take them now." ’ ‘
If you’re not your own boss.
bringing your dog to work is diff i—‘
cult to impossible. Louise Taylor

of Maynard has gone so far as to
smuggle her dog into work at pre-
_' vious jobs in a museum and at a

.7 Cambridge energy resource com—
‘ pany. She did it again at her cur-
§ rent job at Leslie College .during
1 the August heat wave.

“You have to come in early.

sneak them into the office and.
ti close the door.” But there are
problems. Taylor admitted. “With
my black lab. Bently. he'd bark
when 1 left the office. so I didn't
leave my office too often." '

Yet it's worth it to Taylor. a

; confirmed dog devotee and co-au—
i. thor of "Dogs and their Women."
; a photography book published by
z Little. Brown & Co. that is due out
’ next spring. ‘

"The main thing the dog does

when you bring him to work is

that he makes the day fun." said
Taylor. “You come to the office
and have all this stress and 'all'
this work to do and you pet your
dog and it makes you feel good
and changes your whole attitude

. what the dog does. it warms
the place right up." '

Masked raiders thumb noses at law and: order

8}! Susan Herold
’hoenix Gazette

Each night, Gina and David Chorus are being
terrorized.

By a family of raccoons.

A mother raccoon and her four offspring, to be
exact.

Sure, the thought of two adults cowering in fear
from a pack of those furry little masked mammals
seems laughable.

The Charns even admit they thought the whole
thing was humorous -- at first.

But when the goldfish in the couple’s backyard
pond began mysteriously disappearing, the raccoon
family just didn’t seem that cute anymore.

And when the (’harns woke one morning to find
the bloodv carcasv of one of t heir chickens in a“

, nearby tree, the couple got downright upset.
"We had 13 chickens, and now we’re down to ‘
eight of them,” says Gina Charns, who keeps a

variety of small animals ontheir two—acre lot near ..

16th Street and Northern Avenue. “The chest was
taken out of one of the chickens, and last week all
we found were the feathers of one.” ‘ .

Weary of losing their chickens, which have smce
quit laying, the-couple thought it was time to put-
an end to the raccoons’ free dinner. _ ‘ ,

So they picked up the phone and began calling,
the agencies they thought surely could help -—-
(iiame and Fish Department, Maricopa County
Animal Control, even the Phoenix 17200.,

But they always got the same response.

PHOENIX GAZETTE - Oct. 11, 1988

”if" "Everyone said there was noth-

’ ing they could do. The Game and
; Fish Department said if they were
: a nuisance, to call the pest control
3 company and they could kill them.

But I don’t want to kill them,” she
says.

Instead, the Cbarns were forced
to shell out money for cat traps
and try their hand at taming the
shrewd raccoons.

"We have no experience with
raccoons. We’re afraid they may
have rabies and they could be
dangerous. We ﬁgured the zoo or
someone would come out and at
least set some traps, but no one
would help,” Gina says.

According to the Game and Fish
Department, there are hundreds of
Valley residents with wildlife
problems similar to the Charns.

And there is no easy solution.

"We get lots of calls like this,” -

admits Mark Jecker, Game and
Fish public information officer,
"but we pretty much don’t come
out on small animals. We’re
spread so thin that we will come
out for endangered or threatened
species only.”

Unless the animal appears rabid
or is extremely out of place -- a
wild bear in the middle of Seventh
Street, for example — virtually no
public agency will come to your
aid, Jecker says.

"We mainly realized this prob—
lem was too much for us to take
on. And unless you believe it’s
rabid, you will get no official help
from anybody — police, fire or the
state,” he says.

Instead, the state allows you to
kill the animal if it is not protected

 

by wildlife laws and it is endanger».
ing you or your property, Jecker:
says. ' .

To make things even easier, a
handful of pest control companies 1
will do the dirty work for you.

"A few years ago, pest control
companies didn’t want to mess
with (wildlife removal) because
they were afraid they’d get in
trouble. We now allow them to.
remove them, and generally, that
is what we recommend,” he says.
For larger or endangered wildlife,
he suggests calling the nearest
Game and Fish regional office.

But what about people like the
Charns who don’t want to kill the
family of raccoons that has stum-
bled into their back yard?

"They call us,” sass Megan
Mosby, education coorrﬁiirator for
the Liberty Wildlife Rehabilitation
Foundation.

A nonproﬁt group {sanded in
1981 to release wildlife bk into
their native habitat, is founda-
tion takes over where public agen-
cies leaVe off.

"It’s amazing how many people
face these situations. When we
first started we had 350 animals a
year; so far this year, we have over
1,500,” Mosby says.

The group gives advice on haw
to trap the animals and will
release the captured wildlife in the
right places.

"People are just real frustrated
and at their wit’s end, so we try
whenever we can to help. We just
released a skunk —- you can be
sure no one else wants to do that,”
she said.

 




LONDON DAILY TELEGRAPH

- England - October 13, 1988

A llama gazes from her pen during yesterday’s camelid auction at the Royal Agricultural Show, Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. One group of

PERUVIAN pipe music echoed
through the food hall of the Royal
Agricultural Show, Stoneleigh, War-
wicks, yesterday at what was
claimed to be Europe’s ﬁrst auction
of llamas and other camelids.

The animals, which include alpacas and
guanacos, have moved out of the zoos and
onto British farms as farmers search for
enterprises not subject to Common Mar-
ket curbs because'of over-production.

Mr Gerald Walker and his wife Pamela,
of Maplehurst Llamas, llorsham, Sussex,
put up 37 animals plus several recently-
born calves for auction.

animals, prized for their ﬂeece,

fetched an average £3,255 each

nick market for llamas

By Godfrey Brown, Agriculture Correspondent

Within two hours they had sold 27 lots
for a total of £87,885—an average of
£3,255 per animal. '

About 250 people attended the sale.
Top price of 9,000 guineas was paid for a
three-year-old female alpaca named Abi-
gail imported from Sweden.

Another female alpaca called Lady Di,
was withdrawn at 11,000 guineas. Mr
Walker said he had set a 12,000 guineas
reserve on her.

Half the llamas on sale were imported
into Britain from Sweden, Poland and
Holland, while the other half were bred in
this country. lmports direct from South
America are banned because of endemic
foot and mouth disease.

Llamas are being reared for their highly
prized ﬂeece. The yield of fleece varies
from about two to ﬁve kilograms a year
and can be worth up to £2.50 an ounce, so

a good quality “crop” could be worth £400
or more.

In America, llamas are kept as highly
prized and high-priced pets rather than
commercial ﬂeece producers.

British Camelids, the owners and
breeders’ association, has some 70
members. .

Llamas appear peaceable, although
they can spit some distance ifangered.

Guanacos are on the schedule of dan-
gerous wild animals. Anyone wanting to
keep them in captivity must have a local
authority-licence, unless they are to be
kept in zoos, circuses or experimental
research institutes.

The Phoenix man who declared that he was willing

to go to prison because his three dogs mauled a.

3-year-old girl might get the chance to do just that.

Simon Moreau, 34, an unemployed welder, has
been indicted on a charge of felony endangerment in
the Sept. 21 attack by his three Rottweilers.

The Maricopa County Grand Jury indictment was
handed down Oct. 4 but not made public until
Tuesday. '

, Moreau, of 4123 N. Longview Ave., was served a
“summons for his arraignment next Tuesday but was
,not arrested, Maricopa County Attorney’s Ofﬁce
"spokeswoman Sylvia Lopez said.

Moreau’s three Rottweilers attacked Linda Lopez
fafter they escaped from Moreau’s yard. The child

required 130 stitches to close the wounds.

A hearing is scheduled Monday before Judge Barry
Schneider on a complaint ﬁled by the county’s
Rabies-Animal Control Division seeking a court order
to have the three dogs destroyed. . ‘

Meanwhile, little Linda is doing well but "does not
look very good,” according to Jim Hart, an attorney
employed by her family.

“She’s adjusting pretty well, a little better than
expected,” Hart said Tuesday.

Hart said a civil lawsuit would be filed against

Moreau, probably sometime after Monday’s hearing,

at which the fate of the dogs will be decided.

Larry Lopez and Helen Padilla, Linda’s parents,
will be at the hearing, Hart said.

“They’re concerned that the dogs be destroyed or at
least put into a position where they can never do it

(attack someone) again,” Hart said.

He said Lopez and Padilla are taking "no position
one way or another” on the legal fate of Moreau.

"Their main concern is that what happened to
their little girl does not happen to another,” Hart
said. "They have no personal vendetta against Mr.
Moreau.”

Linda’s parents are having some problems of their
own. The couple were evicted from their apartment at
the April Showers complex in the 4100 block of north
Longmore Avenue and are staying with relatives,
Hart said.

5, He said Lopez hopes to find a job so he can earn
enough money to move his family into another
apartment. _

family moved out Saturday. Ron Hottle said Lopez

was 2% months behind in the rent and that a move to
evict the ' family was started before Linda was
attacked.

Hottle said the owner of the apartments, 'whom he
did not identify, was not going to seek any money
from Lopez. ' '

(d ,e’s just going to drop the whole thing,” Hottle
sai . ‘ . '

He said‘that before the family moved out, he helped
organize a yard and bake sale that raised $200 for
Linda. ' .

."1 hope she’s doing all right,” Hottle said. "It’s

Moreau could not be reached for comment. A

speaking to a reporter.

Students’ safety
worries teachers

By Tina Daunt
The Arizona Republic

Teachers at Dobson High School in
Mesa say they are worried about
students‘ safety because a “nut” has
been killing animals at the school and
students have been getting threatening
phone calls.

A sheep was found shot. to death at
the salami Size-zine g. “ the attricnlture
teacher found a dead rabbit on her car
Tuesday.

“If someone would kill an animal
like that, who knows what else they
would do,” said Linda Proctor, the
teacher. “I’m just afraid I’ll come in
one day and ﬁnd one of my students
shot in the pen.”

According to a report filed with the
Mesa Police Department, a ewe was
found dead Sunday in the agriculture
pen at the school.

Proctor said an autopsy revealed
that the animal was shot in the chest
with a large caliber gun.

The school did not report the
incident to police until Tuesday, when
student Lance Robinson, 17, who
owned the ewe, got a phone call at his
home.

An unfamiliar male voice told him,
“Your dog is next.”

Then Proctor found the rabbit on
her car with its throat slit.

“The kids are mad and upset,”
Proctor said. “They can’t figure out
why anyone would do something like
this. It scares the kids pretty bad to
think there’s some nut running
around out there.”

Proctor said that earlier this
summer, two sheep were found dead
in the pen. The animals were disposed
of without an autopsy being per-
formed, she said.

“I thought it was strange that they
suddenly died,” Proctor said. “But I
didn’t think that someone had killed
them. I guess I just don’t think of
people doing that. But looking back, I
think it was related to this.”

Proctor said she, too, has been
receiving crank phone calls at her
home and office.

“When I answer the phone, there’s

.just silence,” she said.

Jim Ball, another agriculture in-

structor at Dobson High, said school

 

l

employees have warned students not
to walk alone around campus at night
or on weekends.

“There’s a lot of concern for the
kids,” Ball said. “We’re telling them
to be careful.”

Meanwhile, Mesa ‘police have
agreed to increase patrols in the area.

‘ “We want these people to know
that they’re walking on thin ice‘ now,”
Proctor said.

. Proctor said that last year, she
encountered similar incidents at Hen-
drix Junior High School in Mesa.

j During a full moon, Proctor said,
“satanists” broke into a pen and
sedomized six sheep.

‘ “We found one of the ewes with a
broken neck.”

Proctor said satanic symbols were I

drawn on the animals.

Staff Reporter

 

The Midtown coyote has been
; called a lot of things -— most of
.which can’t be put inprint.

Fred Hodges, who says his poo-
dle was bitten by the coyote, has
a few choice words for the
neighborhood’s least-wanted
resident. '

. But. Minetry Apperson is call-

~ing the coyote a scapegoat. It
seems she’s gotten attached to
the nocturnal critter who begs
handouts from Central Gardens
residents.

Hodges’ 17-year-old poodle,
Cricket, was bitten earlier this
, month in)“ an animal Hodges de—
scribed as the coyote. “She’s
blind and deaf, so she didn’t
even know the animal was over
her until it bit her.” .

Hodges said he has talked
'about the coyote with Norman
LaChappelle, director of envir-
onmental health for the Health
Department. “He said he would
see what could be done about
.the animal.”

‘ Ms. Apperson, a member of the
Memphis Humane Society board,

 

is seeking a trap to apprehend
the coyote so it can be turned
over to the 200 or a wildlife
group.

A member of the Central Gar-
dens Area Association board, his.
Apperson said she had received
other complaints about the
coyote. “But as long as the neigh-
bors keep feeding him, he’s go- 1
mg to stay around here,” she
said.

Other neighbors claim the
coyote has eaten their cats, Ms.
Apperson said. Some say it has
found a mate, and that they fear
more little coyotes soon will be
combing their garbage pails. “I
don’t think any of that is true. To
me, the raccoons are more of a
problem than the coyote," she
said.

“He eats rats and rodents in
the neighborhood. I know I
sound like some kind of ‘Save
the Coyote’ freak or something,
but Ijust think he’s taking a lot
of abuse for things he probably
didn’t do.”

For several months, the coyote
has roamed the neighborhood,
which stretches from Eastmore-
land and Linden on the north, to
the Louisville and Nashville
railroad on the south, to Rem-
bert, Barksdale and Higbee on
the east, and to Willett, Cleve-
land and Central on the west.

Ms. Apperson said that if the
problem is still unresolved, the
Central Gardens board will dis-
cuss .the coyote at its Monday
meeting.

Hunt by Youths in Florida Provokes V
T Urban Opposition and Rural Defense

 

By JEFFREY SCHMALZ
Special to Th:—~New York Times

STARKE, Fla., Oct. 16 -— Ten-year-
old Michael Hall, perched in a tree, his
green and brown camouflage outfit
about two sizes too big, spotted the first
deer shortly after sunrise.

. He let go with a blast from his 20-
gauge pump-action shotgun, but so big
was the gun and the boy so little that
the kick threw him from the tree, and
he missed.

He scrambled back up, ready this
time. And when the next deer came
along —- an 84-pound, 2!,ié-year-old doe
—— Michael Hall, who is in the fourth
grade, made his first kill.

“It’s fun,” he said when asked how it

ad felt to kill the animal. Then he
posed beside the carcass, shotgun in
hand, a young Teddy Roosevelt of the
north Florida wilderness.

On Saturday the state opened up
1,000 acres of Camp Blanding, the Na-
;tional Guard installation here, about 50
miles southwest of Jacksonville, and
today for hunting by 40 boys and girls

as ”young as 8 years old and as old as 15. .

They were chosen by lottery from
”more than 400 who applied. State game
"officials say the intent is to instill en-
thusiasm for hunting and to educate
them.
But residents and officials of urban
areas and along the southern Atlantic
'coast say the real purpose is not educa-
'tion, but indoctrination. They say that
*with opposition to hunting rising in
stme parts of the country, game offi-
cials in Florida want to make sure the

early age.

“ In any case, those from south Florida
say, it is ridiculous to encourage
'8-year-olds to be in the woods with guns

conducted what it calls a youth hunt;

 

 

there was one in each of the last three
years. But the opposition seems to be;
catching on this time in part because
the issue of guns and children has been
in the forefront in Florida this year.

Thirty-five children have died in!
Florida this . year from gunshotl
wounds, most of them homicides. The
National Rifle Association created a
fuss when it proposed giving classes on ‘
guns in the public schools. The associa.l
tion said it merely wanted to teach,
safety; opponents said it wanted to en-f
courage gun use, albeit recreational
use.

The association failed to win ap-
proval of the classes. Later, officials in
Dade County, which includes Miami,
said they were outraged to discover
that the association was sending copies
of its youth magazine, InSights, di-
rectly to school libraries.

In addition, the hunt comes at a time
of increasing friction between urban
and rural areas in this state. Florida’s
population explosion is fueled mostly
by an influx of Northerners, many of
them from the cities, who have little
understanding of hunting.

“This isn’t the longtime residents of
F lorida,” Dewey Weaver, a spokesman
for the State Fresh Water Fish and
Game Commission, said of the oppo-
nents. “It’s the new people in West
Palm Beach, ‘Dade County. They’re
elderly. They come from Chicago and
New York. Guns mean only trouble to

1 them.”

Even, Gov. Bob Martinez has been
drawn into the dispute. Cleveland
Amory, the author and activist for ani-
mal rights, confronted Mr. Martinez at
a Chamber of Commerce breakfast
last week and demanded he cancel the
hunt

“Have you no shame?” Mr. Amory
asked. “Have you no pity? It’s high
time for a brave governor to know
what he is doing with this.” .

Mr. Martinez ignored the comments.
But later he said the hunt should go on '
because it would foster closer relation-
ships between parents and their chil-
dren. '

Groups opposed to the killing of ani-i
mals, particulary the Fund for Ami—i
mals, have seized on the Florida hunt
as a rallying point for their fight
against all hunting. which they call
cruel. Florida genie officials, like game
officials elsewhere, respond that it is
less cruel to shoot a deer than to let it
die slowly from starvation as a result
of overpopulation.

As for letting 8-year-olds handle
guns, Larry Wallace, helping his
9-year-old son, Matthew, unload his 12-

During the regular deer hunting sea-

of the state, a child of any age can hunt

SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE - October 12, 1988

Debate Over Discipline by Violence

By Bill Gordon
Chronicle Staﬂ‘ Writer

Penny and Tinkerbelle, the
San Francisco Zoo’s Asian ele-
phants, galumph about their
enclosure looking just as sweet
as Dumbo and as thoughtful as
tiabar.

Crowds of children gather ev—
ery day to watch the pachyderms
perform simple tricks and nuzzle
their trainers.

But the real life of elephants in
American zoos and circuses differs
violently from the cutt lives of ele—
phahts in storybooks

The children who donated
their allowances to buy baby Penny
33 years ago never see the harsh
blows to the elephants’ heads and
electric shocks with cattle prods
that keep the huge creatures docile
and obedient.

Allegations of Abuse

Allegations that keepers regu-
larly abuse elephants surfaced last
week after 7,000~pound Tinkerbelle
went out of control and pinned a
veterinarians assistant to the
ground, crushing the woman’s pel-
vis.

The charges by several animal
keepers that the elephants suffer
regular beatings shocked many peo
ple — from public officials to occa-
sional 200 visitors.

Subsequent reports shocked
them more.

Elephant handlers all over the
country concede that they regular-
ly discipline the animals with elec-
tric shocks, by beating them on the
head with ax handles and shackling
their legs with chains. _

“For many years, this type of
treatment has been hidden,” said
former trainer Pat Derby of Galt.
Sacramento County, who now oper-
ates an animal refuge called the
Performing Animal Welfare Soci-
ety. “Zoos are going to have to un-
derstand the public will no longer
allow it.” .

Sylvia Stewart was fired as an ,
elephant keeper at the San Francrs- .

co Zoo because she opposed the use

of violence to “c 0!” Penny and

'l‘inkerbelle.

“This is a war starting,” she
said. “They cannot handle ele-
phants this way. They cannot beat

' and torture them.”

Elephant Handling

 

Zoo keepers, veterinarians and
others experienced in the tradition-
al methods of elephant handling ac-
knowledge that a growing debate
exists among experts over the best
way to control elephants.

“There’s an even greater ques-
tion. Should these animals be kept
in captivity?" asked San Francisco

Zoo director Saul Kitchener, who

believes that zoos can keep ele-
phants safely and humanely.

“If the public rebels and says
we can’t do these things (use the
controversial techniques) to the ani-
mals. then we should not keep the
elephants,” Kitchener added.

Elephant-handling techniques
have remained largely unchanged
since the huge animals were domes-
ticated more than 3,000 years ago in
Asia.

The zoo keepers of America are
still using the same ancient tool de-
veIOped by the mahouts of India to
work the world’s largest land ani-
mals. Called an ankus, or elephant
hook, it is a wooden rod with a steel
spike at one end.

Handlers use the hooked end to
pull the elephant’s foot or neck or
use the blunt end to strike the ani-
mal‘s head. Some keepers say han-
dlers at the San Francisco Zoo also
beat the elephants with the spike,
causing deep puncture wounds that
penetrate the animals’ thick skin.

Techniques Defender!

 

Elephant trainers describe the
blows to the animals' heads as “at—
tention getting” and no more harm-
f iii to the f our-ton animals than the

swats a baby elephant gets from the .
matriarch of a herd in the wild. The .

trainers use the physical discipline
to place themselves on top of the

elephants‘ strict social hierarchy.

“They are big, powerful ani-

mals and they glory in their domi-

nance,” said Michael Schmidt, vet-
erinarian at the Washington Park
Zoo in Portland, Ore, ‘which oper-
ates one of the most respected and
successful elephant breeding pro-
grams in‘the world.

When trainers fail to establish
firm control over elephants, the
powerful animals “test” the hu-
mans. '

“Occasionally, you have to use

'force to establish dominance.”

Schmidt said. “But if you‘re really
dominant, you shouldn’t have to use
force very often.”

Critics charge that the disci-
pline of elephants too often turns
into beatings. In addition to the an-
kus, the handlers’ arsenal includes

. electric prods, ax handles and base-

ball bats.

No Clear Guidelines

 

Elephant handlers learn to use
the tools in on-the-job training. No

, formal teaching programs or clear
, guidelines exist to prepare ele-

phants handlers, critics complain.

“The zoo has no established
standard of what is acceptable disci-

' pline. When does discipline become
. abuse?” asked Paul Hunter, a for-

mer elephant handler at the San

‘ Francisco Zoo who now works with
' the big cats.

Hunter was the first 200 em-
ployee to blame mistreatment of

‘ the elephants for last week’s attack.

The same complaint of lack of
guidelines is leveled against zoos all

1 over the country.

Instead of using the ankus as a
tool to communicate with the ele-
phants -— something like an artifi-
cial trunk —— handlers often sharp
en the hook to wound the animals,
the critics say.

The San Francisco Zoo’s ele-
phant. handlers also carry electric
prods to shock the animals into com.
pliance and chaintbem for up to 16
hours a day.

“When you work around ele
phants, you have to think big,” head
keeper Michele Channon said last

 




week. “They’re big, dangerous ani-
mals. You have to love them big and
be firm with them big.”

Zoo officials say the animals
must be chained at night to prevent
them from injuring one another
and to permit veterinarians to ex-

amine them.

“Chaining an animal two-thirds
of it’s life can’t be right,” replied
Sandra Keller, spokeswoman for a
San Francisco group, Citizens for a
Better Zoo.

Elephant handlers at Oakland’s
Knowland Park Zoo also use electric
prods and chain the animals. The
San Jose Zoo does not have ele-

phants.

dents of alleged abuse occurred ear-
lier this year at the prestigious San
Diego Zoo’s Wild Animal Park. A
hearing into the February incident
revealed that Dunda, an 18-year-old
African elephant, received more
than 100 blows to the head with ax
handles over a two-day period as
discipline for lunging at a keeper.

Six zoo employees brought the
elephant to her knees with chains
and hit her on the head with the ax
handles, shouting “Dunda, no!” ac.
cording to investigators for the San
Diego Zoological Society and the
San Diego Humane Society.

San Diego Zoo officials defend-
ed the action as a necessary and
proper elephant management tech-
nique. .

The San Francisco Zoo also dis
ciplined Tinkerbelle after she injur-
ed the veterinarian’s assistant last
week. Kitchener described the ses-
sion as “putting her through her
routine” of simple tricks to re-estab-
lish control over her, Kitchener

said. ‘ .~—-- «J- a. - —-- :'

One of the most dramatic inci-

Former trainer Derby preposes
that zoos prove such discipline ses-
sions are conducted properly by al-
lowing humane societies to video-
tape them for public distribution.

Some critics question the need
for any kind of hands-on discipline
and control of the huge beasts.

“If we’re going to keep these
animals in zoos, we ought to make
them as comfortable as possible and
then leave them alone,” said former
elephant handler Hunter.

Breeding Programs

 

But zoo officials insist that ele
phants must be strictly handled and
disciplined to allow veterinarians to
conduct a captive breeding pro-
gram.

Mai‘y 0‘ “‘9 cont§939§§i¥§l§m

agement techniques stem from re
quirements of the breeding pro-
grams, which are aiming to save the
endangered Asian elephant species.

Zoos must use physical disci-
pline to train the elephants to stand
quietly for blood tests, artificial in-
semination and other necessary
procedures, trainers contend.

North American zoos recently.
adopted about a dozen basic oral
commands such as “down” and
“come here” to aid handlers when
elephants are exchanged in breed-
ing programs.

“There are no successful breed.
ing programs where they don’t go
inand manage the elephants,” said
William Boever, head veterinarian
of the St Louis Zoo and a member
of the elephant species survival pro-

. gram of the American Association
3 of Zoological Parks and Aquariums.

5’ Boever noted, however, that
{a better elephant breeding programs,
, such as the one in Portland, use
. “squeeze cages” and other devices
; that allow handlers to immobilize
‘ , the animals without handling them.

i. But Derby aid some other ani~

5 ma] rights supporters charge that

, the zoos merely turn elephants into
“breeding machines” at the ex-
pense of the animals’ emotional
well-being and health.

3 As the debate intensified after
’ the incidents in San Diego and San
. Francisco, several groups started in-
vestigations into the treatment of
elephants and other exotic animals.

Kitchener asked a panel of the
country’s most respected experts on
elephant training to investigate the
San Francisco Zoo’s program. The
panel includes Boever, Michael
Keele, assistant curator of the

1. Washington Park Zoo, and Dale.
' Tuttle, director of the Jacksonville

(Fla) Zoological Park.

At 82, George Adamson still
does battle with Kenya poachers

By The New York Times

~ ORA ROCK, Kenya —
This is George AdamSon
country, five miles south
of the equator, a harsh region
blanketed with sandy soil and
prickly gray thorn bushes and
populated by wild game and So-
‘mali nomads.
. It is from here, in the isolation
of eight thatched huts, that
Adamson — who with his late
wife, Joy, created the legend of
Elsa, the lion of “Born Free” -
has spent the past 18 years roam-
ing over the 580 square miles of
the Kora National Reserve.

After separating from his wife,
he set up camp to nurture young
lions, return them to the wild and
then remain their friend.

But it is not only lions that
Adamson is concerned with these
days.

At 82, Adamson has found a
new and compelling cause: a
campaign against the poaching of
elephants, valued for their ivory
by international traders.

“They’ve killed all the rhinoc-
eros and now they’re onto the ele-
phants,” Adamson said as he sat,
in his characteristic green shorts
and sandals, over early morning
tea in his hut. '

The morning before, he had

meat on a track near his camp,
clear evidence that yet another
elephant had been shot.
mber of other
conservation—
ists, Adam-
son worries
that the ele—
phant, once
so numerous
all over Ken—
ya, will sur-
vive in only a
few pockets
of the coun-

A fierce
George Adamson critic of what
he calls the Kenyan govern-
ment’s lax attitude to poachers,
Adamson is particularly upset
that elephants are killed for their
ivory in the reserve around his
camp where the animals are sup-
posed to be protected.

Exactly how many elephants
are left in Kenya is a subject of
hot dispute between the Kenyan
government and the conserva-
tionists.

About 22,000 elephants still
roam the plains, the government
says. The East African Wildlife
Society says it is probable that
poaching has reduced the herds
to 6,000.

ard Leakey, recently asserted
that senior, government officials
were involved in the poaching.

Whatever the number of ele-
phants, the murder of three rang-
ers in the Kora Reserve by
poachers has spurred the govern-
ment to say it will take more con-
certed action.

“The government is increasing
the man power, training and
equipment available to rangers,”
the minister for tourism and wild-
life, George Muhoho, said after
the murders.

Adamson believes that his
presence in the reserve serves as
a protection, however small, for
the elephants. ’

The Somalis know and the gov-'
ernment knows, Adamson said. -
he will do all he can to report the
poaching and track the killers.

But despite the government’s
statements, his is probably a los-
ing battle, he said.

David Allen, a visiting pilot,
agreed.

“The government wants
George out of here,” he said.
“They don’t want anyone around
so the poachers can work more a
freely. I don’t think any interna-\;
tional wildlife organization should j

Shop stops public feeding
of live mice to reptile

 

By PATTI ROTH
Staff Writer

A pet Shop in Sunrise has agreed
to stop feeding live mice to an alli-
gator-like reptile in front of cus-
tomers.

A request to stop the feedings
came from representatives of the
Florida Game and Fresh Water
Fish Commission. The agency’s ac-
tion was prompted by a complaint
from a Davie woman, who said she
was offended by a practice in
which customers could pay $2 to
watch as a mouse was fed to the
21/z—foot caiman: .

Lt. John West of the fish and
game commission said there is

nothing wrong with feeding the am-
mal live prey, but he said he consid-

ers it inappropriate to do so in pub- .

lic view.

West said workers at Pets U.S.A.,
in the 15900 block of State Road 84,
agreed to comply, and in fact, told
him they would get rid of the cal-
man.

The society’s chairman, Rich- fesses against poaching.”

Marcy Kohrs, president of the

* corporation which owns the store,

said the caiman was not fed live
mice in front of customers who did
not want to see it. ,

The reptile must eat anyway, she
said, and charging customers was a
way of offsetting the cost of feed-
mg.
“These things have to eat,” die

”said. “If [the woman who com-
plained] thinks I should feed it
‘ something dead, how does she think

it gets dead?”
Lynn Morano, who called the
game and fish commission, said she

1 and her two daughters hurried out

of the store on Sunday when three
teen-agers came in to take advan-
tage of the $2 offer — which was
advertised by a handwritten sign
taped to the caiman’s aquarium.

“I thought [the sign] was like a
joke,” she said. “I didn’t think they
would feed a live mouse in front of
customers and be charging them $2
for this thrill. And that’s what hap-
pened.”

and mercury —- that they qualify as

When they do wash ashore, at
the rate of about a dozen every
summer, it is hard to understand
how the whales ever managed to

Chinese urged to switch
rom pork to horse meat

United Press International

BEIJING — A leading agricultural expert
says pork-loving Chinese citizens should eat more
horse meat to handle the growing surplus of
equines left jobless by farm modernization. ‘

“Some people don’t like the sour taste, (but)
only horses that run a lot and accumulate acids
in their muscles have this taste,” said Dr. Wang
Tiequan, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.

“Our future horse meat will not have this
problem,” Wang told the official English-lan-
guage China Daily newspaper Friday.

“We hope the mass media can help to change
peOple’s views on horse meat.”

Wang said China’s 10.9 million horses are
quickly being replaced by tractors and trucks,
leaving the world’s most populous nation with a
new type of overpopulation problem.

Though it will take some persuading, he said,

the Chinese people could learn to enjoy sitting
down to gobble up dishes of horse ﬂesh.

Horse meat is mostly lean, with 18 percent fat
content, less than half the amount in pork, the
paper said. The price of pork, the meat of choice
among Chinese, also has skyrocketed during the
past few months, making horse meat a cheap
dietary substitute, Wang said.

China currently exports 40,000 tons of horse
meat a year, from about 150,000 horses, with
most of it delivered to Hong Kong and Japan,
the paper said. It ranks fourth in the world in the
export of horse ﬂesh.

Wang said that if the race for horse meat
doesn’t go like gangbusters, the country could
bring back horse-racing. He said it would be a
good way to raise money while rejuvenating the
breeding of China’s 15 native breeds.

“Horse-racing is not a gambling industry . . .
but a good form of entertainment,” he said.

Opening day of dove season was a bust in
more ways than one.

The weather, combined with the drought,
stunted crops of brown millet, sunl lowers, etc, to
the point that doves ignored fields that had been
productive 111 the past.

And state and federal law enlorcement offi-
cers had a field day with dove-hunting violators.

State conservation rangers made 529 cases of
hunting over bait, and federal officers added
hundreds to that total.

The state case drawing the most notoriety oc-
curred in Catoosa County on a field owned by

Rep. Robert G. Peters (D—Ringgold). Photos of

the field showed piles of corn scattered through
out. The case has been turned over to the US.
Attorney for the northern district of Georgia.

Rep. Peters declined to comnn 11.1

Federal and state 1ange1s raid ld a field near
the McFarland Road exit on Geo1gia 400 that in-
cluded 200 hunters. Charges included taking of
dove by aid of bait, in this case the multiple
seeding of wheat.

Agent Tom Wharton said he couldn’t discuss

"r111: ATLANLK cons'rrrurnln

 

details of any pending case, but no decision had

been made about whether to prosecute all 200'

hunters on the Ga. 400 field.

Convicted violators face a maximum $500
fine and/or six months in jail. In past cases,
some federal judges have given lesser fines
against hunters 011 certain fields if the prosecu-

tion was able to prove who baited the fields. The"

other hunters were called victims of circum~
stances in some cases.

There is some confusion among hunters
about the issue of baited dove fields. Currently,
the law is so liberal that it is possible to bait
f ields. but hunters can’t shoot over them.

A key regulation states that a baited area
“shall remain a baited area for 10 days following
complete removal of all such corn, wheat or oth-
er grain, salt. or other feed.” Hunting over a
baited area is illegal during that 10-day period.

Agent Wharton said he has three “tricks of
the trade” that alert him to the possibility of a
baited field:

I'l‘he field is freshly plowed, disked or
cultivated.

I The ﬁeld is freshly seeded on opening day.

u'l‘here are large concentrations of doves

 

 

 

(and pigeons. . ‘
The hunter has a responsibility to determine

if a field is baited. Ignorance of the situtation is
no excuse, said Agent Wharton.

Another longtime agent, Joe Wright, said
hunters should "ask the host.” They could also
inspect the field once or twice during the 10-day

'period to ensure no baiting is taking place, be-

cause when federal or state officers stage a raid,
there usually is no doubt about the matter. ,
The field usually has been under surveil-

lance t'or weeks, f1o111 the air and by agents slip?
ping onto the fields at night collecting samples of .

baiting.

Agent Wright has a simple rule of thumb on
his own hunts: “If you have a (freshly) plowed
field 011 opening day, stay away from it.”

Both agents said there were legal methods to
make a field inviting to doves without “putting
out a little encouragement.”

They said a good source is Dr. JeffJackson at
the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension
Service. His materials, available to the public,
show how to prepare a field so that it will draw
in doves for the entire season without having to
resort to plowing.

‘ Wandering moose finds happiness with porcine pal

By The Associated Press
SARANAC LAKE, N.Y. -- Big
Richard is back in town, an annual

- sign that it’s mating season for

“£137 w~w’>~\ .1.

moose, but showing up on time is
about as far as this bull ever gets
and this year his sexual confusion
is even worse.

Big Richard, who stands 6 feet
at the shoulders, has been turning
up at farms in the Adirondacks ev-
ery fall for the last five years look-
ing for potential mates.

He kept confusing moose cows

‘with dairy cows, which didn’t re-
turn his affection. . g

53:13“

After being snubbed by a few
more dairy cows this year, the
1 ,300- -pound bull seems to have re
bounded and found a new love, a
yearling pig named May Dawn.

“I guess Big Richard has
changed his tastes,” said Fred
Winderl, a part- -time farmer in
Lake Saranac, just outside Lake
Placid, who owns the pig. “He
seems to have taken up quite and
attachment with the pig, and the
pig with Big Richard.”

Winderl said he’s not so sure

1. how deep this new-found friendship
. , , , extends, but said he’s not too war-

ard is around because he harasses

ried.

“If he and May Dawn are com-
patible, it’s all right with me, ” Win-
derl said. “I’m just waiting to see
what develops.”

Though the moose is basically
harmless if left alone, Big Richard
has become an unwelcome sight at
farms, according to Ken Kogut, a
senior biologist with the state De-
partment of Environmental Con-

, servation. ,
“A lot of farmers have been

complaining that their milk pro-
duction goes down when Big Rich-

the calves so much,” Kogut said.

“Farmers chase him away, but he

keeps on coming back He’s 1

very persistent.”

Big Richard’s sexual confusion
stems in part from his loneliness,
said Dale Garner, who tracks the

moose as part of his graduate work ,

with the State University of New
York’s College of Environmental
Science.

Kogut said Big Richard will ei-
ther head out:on his own or be
moved by trailer to a less populat-

. ed area of the Adirondacks once

mating season ends.

Better care planned
for farm animals

By Godfrey Brown, Agriculture Correspondent

FARM ANIMALS will soon be better cared-for under
new rules proposed yesterday by the Ministry of Agri-

1

culture. The regulations, ﬁrst suggested by the Farm
Animal Welfare Council, will come into force early
next year after comments from the farming industry.

f

The proposals cover the
buildings that house live-
, stock and the ﬁttings inside.
Animals should be fed a
wholesome diet to keep them
healthy, be given clean
drinking water each day, and
have a well-drained or well-
maintained lying area with

dry bedding.

Poultry will have to be kept on,
or have access to, well-main-
tained litter, although this does
not apply to hens kept in battery
cages, where the requirements
are covered by separate
regulations.

Rabbit hutches or cages will
'have to be big enough for the
animals to move around and feed
and drink without difﬁculty, and
to enable all the rabbits to be
able to lie on their sides at the
sametime.

The hutches must also be high
enough for them to be able to sit
upright without their ears touch-
ing the top of the hutch. Rabbits
kept in hutches or cages exposed
to the weather and direct sun-
shine must also have access to
shelter.

Intensive livestock units with
automatic ventilation systems
must have an alarm and addi-
tional ventilation equipment to
protect the animals it the auto-
matic system fails. The rules
propose that the alarm should be
tested and the additional ventila;
tion equipment inspected each
week.

Calves over 14 days old will
have to have daily access to dry

,,.food with digestible fibre to
censure development of the
'rumen is not impaired.

The rules will also make it
essential for anyone involved in
.'_looking after livestock to have
access to, and to know and
understand the animal welfare
legislation.

Pit bull
ruling hits
landlady

By Alan Gottlleb
Denver Post Staff Writer

A civil jury has ordered a landla-
dy whose tenants’ pit bull terrier
mauled 6-year-old Corrine Rodri-.
guez two years ago to pay $213,000
to the girl’s family.

After a three-day trial and one
day of deliberation, the six-mem-
ber jury on Friday found that land-
lady Betty Martinez acted care-
lessly and recklessly by allowing a
tenant to keep a pit bull at her
rental property, located at 3646
High St.

The dog, allegedly owned by
Ronald Stubblefield, attacked Ro-
driguez on May 17, 1986, at the cor-
ner of Race Street and East 37th
Avenue. The attack occurred after
the dog broke away from 12-year»
old Damietrez Stubblefield, who
was walking it. Stubblefield has de-
nied owning the dog.

According to the suit, “It requir-
ed several blows with a cane by a
neighbor to force the dog to re-
lease its hol ” on the girl.

Alan Shafner, Rodriguez’ attor-
ney, said the dog’s owners weren’t
named in the suit because the vic-
tims’ family took them to small
claims court earlier this year and
won a $100 judgment. That preclud-
ed them from being sued again.

The suit claims Rodriguez suf-
fered several puncture wounds
that later became infected. The
girl required plastic surgery on her'
leg, but still has “broad and de-
forming scars” that will probably
remain the rest of her life.

Shafner said Martinez is now
renting the High Street property to
a family with two pit bulls. “How
could she not be liable when she
continues with the conduct after

what happened to that little girl?” 3

OF THE HOUSTON POST STAFF

Some northeast Houston residents said Fri-
day a stray dog roundup in their neighborhood
ended in a “siege of terror” when Houston
animal control officers shot and killed two dogs
in front of about 20 shocked witnesses.

“I’m 56 years old and I’ve seen dog-catchers
chase dogs before but I’m just not accustomed
to having warfare in my front yard,” said David
T. Moon, a Denver Harbor resident.

“I could see if the dogs had been rabid or
something, but it just turned the neighborhood
into a siege of terror with three people mnning
around with rifles and shotguns. It’s crazy.”

Houston animal control officials say it’s not
crazy. It’s city policy and each year more than

animal control officers who pack an arsenal of
rifles, tranquilizers and shotguns.

“We certainly have the authority to destroy
animals in the city and we’ve been doing So
since the ordinance was passed in 1865,” said
Dr. Robert Armstrong, chief of Houston’s Bu-
reau of Animal Regulation and Care. “But be-
fore we do it there is generally a complaint
accompanied by a letter of authorization signed
by citizens stating there is a danger in their
neighborhood.”

On Thursday, three animal control officers
--— armed with .4lO-gauge shotguns, .22-cali-
ber rifles, tranquilizer guns and four written
complaints —- rounded up 28 stray dogs in the
Denver i-iarbor subdivision.

In a five—hour span, 18 were captured with-
out Wﬁ'iiijrtfills, six were tranquilized with a dart

i - 200 animals are killed by a select team of

O-~Q-—_

animal control officer point a rifle out of a truck
and gun down a running dog.

. “The dogs might have been a problem but I
didn’t think they went around shooting dogs,”
Flore said. “Couldn’t they have roped them in
or something?”

. Animal Control Officer Lynn' Frink, a field
investigator who shot one of the dogs Thurs-
day, said she and her co-workers prefer to
capture strays the conventional way -- with a

rople or catch-pole, a cable with a loop on the
en .

But when the animals are too aggressive to

gun am: four were gunned down, Armstrong

rope or too wily to tranquilize, they have no
chOice but to shoot them.

Frink is one of only three city animal control
officers authorized to carry and shoot firearms
on the job. She said she and the other field
investigators are expert shots, who take great

care to never jeopardize anyone’s safety. No—
body ever has been injured by a animal control

officer, she said.

So far this year 200 animals have been shot.
Last year 21 1 animals were killed that way.

Denver Harbor Post Office supervisor Mi-
chelle Roberson said the strays were threaten-

I

said. The surviving dogs were taken to the city

pound where they will be put to sleep if no-
body claims them within three days.

Moon and his neighbors saw only two dogs
killed Thursday — and they say that’s all they
ever care to see.

“I wanted to start crying,” said Christina
Sanches, of 7409 Denison. “Those dogs never
did anything to harm anybody. I felt so bad.”

Sanches said her daughter, a first—grader,
witnessed the spectacle and had a nighmare
that evening about the dogs getting shot. She
said about 15 youngsters and eight adults
watched the shooting.

Vera Flores, who owns an embroidery shop
in the neighborhood, said she thinks strays can
be a nuisance, but was appalled to see an

Please see OFFICERS, A-16 '

 

.. "m

, ing postal carriers and stopping them from de-

livering the mail. And four residents who live .

in the area signed consent forms to have the .
, strays rounded up. ‘ ‘

Animal control officials say they don’t ran-

domly visit neighborhoods and “shoot animals

for sport.”

“We have to be invited to come into a3

neighborhood,” said Dan Bugg, animal control
field operations captain. “The bottom line is.

people have a right to walk the streets. And if
animals don’t let them, we have to adjust the ‘

problem.”

Gentlemen:

It is my understanding you are considering producing a
series of postage stamps featuring rodeo themes.

Before you proceed with this idea, I hope you will con—
tact the Humane Society of the U.S. in Washington, DC,
and the American Humane Assn. in Denver, Co. and get the
' FACTS about rodeos, and their treatment of animals who

are forced unwillingly to perform so some joker can get
his/her kicks.

As a.matter of fact, contact any animal organization
and you will fing anyone who cares anything at all about

animalsm.will/§% port or go near a rodeo because they
know what goes on behind the scenes.

we do not need.to promote the brutal “tradition" of rodeo

on U. S. stanps. The word "tradition" has been over-used

in far too nmny instance. It was once ”tradition" to work
small children in the mills in New England; it was once

”tradition" to buy and sell humans as slaves. The list
is long.

It seems to me that stamps should reflect those who have
done something for this country, or places which mean some-
thing to everyone sudh as our National Parks. I realize

stamps have been issued on individual National Parks, but

why not a sheet featuring 50 of our largest and best Na-
.tional Parks?

Should like to hear from you re this.
Thankeyou.

Sincerely,

(Mrs.) Constance F. Yarbrough

Cherie Mason quit

a high-powered
advertising career
to dedicate her

life to saving the
natural environment

92 October 1988/50 PLUS

 

n the early morning, on the coast

of Maine, when Cherie Mason has

time away from her work, she
takes her second cup of tea down to
the gazebo on the rocks. The waves at
high tide slap at the steel pilings of
the dock below. Sea fog drapes the
bay. As she watches the sun’s first
low, slanting rays slowly penetrate
and begin to burn away the fog,
Cherie thinks that she must live in
one of the most beautiful places in the
world. And she is probably right.

B u t s h e h a s
spent too many
years championing
all sorts of environ-
mental and wildlife
issues not to know
what’s in that fog.
It carries factory
fumes from as far
west as her native
Wisconsin and
mixes them with
car exhaust from
Boston and" New
York. The result
5 h e k n o w s b y
heart: a lethal acid
brew of sulphur di-
oxide and nitrogen
oxides. It weakens
the spruces and firs
in front of her,

‘ whose ghostly shapes she can barely

see. It is gradually killing the marine
life in the shallows by the pilings. Is-
sues such as pollution spur Cherie
into activism; hers is a career without
Vacations or retirement.

Cherie’s belief in the great and
complicated goodness of the earth and
all the life it sustains, and in the basic
but often confused goodness of peo-
ple, runs deep. She laughs as she says
it, but she calls herself an evangelist.
“The cause,” she states. “It’s my be-
all. My end-all.” Here on Deer Isle, a
small community Down East, Cherie
is working to change the way people
think about the world.

Her focus and her polish didn’t de-

 

velop overnight. Reﬂecting on her life,
Cherie acknowledges that seemingly
random events often have their own
hidden direction. But you have to look
with the distance that the years allow.
Today, she is able to say that all the
work she ever did was for this: the
training of an environmentalist.

But in 1947, when she graduated
from Northwestern University in Ev-
anston, 111., with a major in speech and
journalism, the term “environmental-
ist” had not been coined..With $100 in
her purse, she took a southbound bus
to search for a broadcasting job in
Texas. She wanted to be a radio ac-
tress and write radio scripts.

Cherie grew up in a single-parent
home. She and her mother had no
money to spare. But Cherie has al-
ways had a constitution that keeps her
going when everyone else starts to
droop, and a buoyancy of heart that
doesn’t permit bitterness or despair.

“It’s not that my life has been
easy,” she reflects, “But I don’t know
how to be a pessimist. I learned early
that if something didn’t work out one
way, with a little extra effort it would
work out another.”

By the 19705, Cherie was married
to Ken Mason, 3 man who matches
her levels of energy and sense of ad-
venture. Cherie, who had worked as a
copywriter, was now a vice president
of the McCann-Erickson Advertising
Agency in Chicago. She had also per-
formed as a radio and TV actress, cre—
ating voices of old people and children
as well as turtles, frogs, bears and
birds. She loved her work, especially
the acting. But something not. yet fo- '

' cused was stirring in her: She was

ready for a change.

.. " “In 1974, the International Sympo—

sium on Endangered Species met in
Washington, DC. I didn’t know much
about wildlife issues, but I had read
about the symposium and was curious.
So I went.”

That first evening she decided,
“This is it! I’ve wasted my time sell-
ing peanut butter. This is what I’m

going to do for the rest of my life!”

Today, she remembers the excite—
ment and the sense of crusade.
”Those people were so wonderful.
First, Jimmy Stewart read from Albert
Schweitzer’s writing, about how nar-
row our relationships with animals had
become. Cleveland Amory talked
about watching a bullfight in Mexico,
and how it changed his life. David
Mech, a field biologist, outlined his
work with endangered timber wolves.
It was heady stuff. Like meeting a
roomful of movie stars. No, it was
better than that. They were heroes. I
wanted to do what they were doing. I
wanted to save the world!”

Back home, Cherie clariﬁed for her-
self what strengths she might bring to
environmental work. Then she took a
plane back to Washington and met
with John Grandy of Defenders of
Wildlife. She outlined for him what
she thought she might do well:
promote important, timely issues,
organize people, write and produce

campaigns, speak to the pub—
lic—everything she had already been
doing in advertising and radio. Only
now there would be an additional in-
gredient: her own profound commit-
ment.

She didn’t mention that she could
do a mean imitation of a bullfrog. but
Grandy got the point. He hired her as
the Midwest representative, for
$7,000 a'year.

As a first assignment. Cherie inves-
tigated a notorious pet store on the
North Side of Chicago. She asked the
owner if she might practice her cam-
era work, using his animals as models.
Not only was he flattered, he offered
to show her the gorilla that be rented
out to parties, and led Cherie into a
pitch—dark back room. When he flicked
on an overhead bulb, Cherie was
standing in front of a tragically abused
animal. It blinked, but barely glanced
up from its cage.

“I’ll poke him for you!” enthused
the owner.

“No. No,” she managed. ”Please
leave him alone.” And she snapped a

picture. Soon after, the pet store own-
er was forced to close down.

“The. reason I work so hard for ani-
mals and their habitats,” Cherie ex-
plains, “is that they are the innocents
of the world. Because we have ruined
so much, they are now in a position of
needing us as protectors and advo-
cates. Also, of course, wild animals
are so beautiful. Once you see them
——not in cages, but on their own
turf—they stay with you.”

Cherie worked tirelessly for De-
fenders of Wildlife before she and Ken
retired to Pine Island on Lake Vermil—
lion, in the heart of the Superior Na-
tional Forest in Minnesota. The island
was her dream place, the retreat
where she would read and write. She
was still passionately committed to
wildlife, but she wanted time to study
the animals and the issues for which
she had fought so hard.

From the big house they could hear
the long, drawn—out, confident voices
of the wolves in winter, and the yo-
dels of the summer loons. She thought
that her life had come full circle.

Born: February 1 2, 1927;
Milwaukee, Wise.

Educated: Marquette University,

and a minor in journalism and
Spanish from Northwestern
University, Evanston, 11].
Married: 1962, to Kenneth Mason,
retired president of the Quaker
Oats Company; daughter, Shelley
Occupation: Environmental
activist

Most Challenging Fight: “Finding
the funds to buy land to create the
Rachel Carson Wildlife Refuge.”

 

 

 

But one winter afternoon, when
Ken was away and the temperature
had dropped to 30 degrees below
zero, Cherie smelled smoke. By the
time the firemen arrived from the
mainland, the house was all but gone.

“Everything! My books. My files.
° Our furniture. When I found that the
cat had died, I didn’t move to save a
thing. I went into shock.”

Recovering from their loss, Cherie
and Ken decided to explore New En-
gland. They wanted to get away, to
start fresh. “When we hit Maine.”
Cherie remembers, “we knew it was
for us. It seemed like home. Familiar.”

Environmental and wildlife issues
that affect Maine, as well as those of
the nation and the world, have en-
gaged her active commitment once
again. They have become her life
work. After two years of lonely cam-
paigning she secured $900,000 in fed-
eral funds to buy 450 acres of “critical
edge” for the Rachel Carson Wildlife
Refuge in southern Maine. “To save
that beautiful wetland from condos,”
she declares.

Another achievement in which she
takes pride is her appointment to the

NEW YORK —— In a major ad-
vance, two groups of scientists
have successfully transplanted
cells from the eye of a rat to the
retina of another rat and cured a
disease that would otherwise
cause blindness.

The work, the first successful
retinal cell transplant, is the
first time that researchers have
been able to cure a degenerative
disease of the central nervous
system.

The researchers cautioned
that the studies would have to be
duplicated in monkeys and per-
haps other animals before the
procedure could be tested on
people. But they said they were
encouraged by the results and
estimated that retinal trans-
plants would be possible for peo-
ple with degenerative eye dis-
eases in five to 10 years.

“I’m sure it will eventually be
done,” said Joe G. Hollyfield, a
research scientist at Baylor Col-
lege of Medicine in Houston who
specializes in diseases of the ret-
ina. “I’m certain of it.”

Degenerative diseases of the
retina are common, occurring in

One of these diseases, macular
degeneration, is the leading
cause of blindness in this
country in people over the age of
60.

_ Doctors can sometimes slow
the loss of vision in patients
with degenerative retinal dis-
eases, but they have no way of
preventing it. Although many
aspects of these diseases are
mysteries, scientists suspect that
the type of retinal cells trans-
planted in the recent experi-
ments could save the vision of
many patients.

“This is the first time that a de-
generative neural disease has
been stoppped in its tracks,” said
Matthew LaVail, of the Universi-
ty of California in San Francisco,
who studies degenerative dis-
eases of the retina.

The experiments, which will
be published within a few
months in the journal Experi-
mental Eye Research, were per-
formed by Dr. James E. Turner
and Dr. Linxi Li of Bdwman
Gray University in Winston-Sa-
lem, NC, and, independently, by
Dr. Peter Gouras and his col-
leagues at Columbia-Prebyter-
ian Medical Center in New York.

Dr. Gouras said he and his col-
leagues hoped to try the retinal
cell transplants on monkeys
next. Dr. Turner said he would

were from an inbred strain that
accepts each other’s tissues
without any rejection. In pa-
tients, the immune system
would probably attack and de-
stroy transplanted cells unless

immunity were suppressed.

“The problem of rejection may .

be a major one,” said Hollyfield,
He added that patients may have
to take drugs like those used by
patients who receive organ
transplants.

He said retinal cells are “quite
hardy” and should be readily
available from eye banks. Also,
he said, they can be grown in the
laboratory.

He and LaVail agreed that the
surgery was technically diff i-
cult but entirely feasible.
“There are many good surgeons

who could do this procedure,"

LaVail said.

The operation would have to
be performed before the pa-
tients had become blind, but

and even a quest for alternative meth—

There also is a strong movement in

Says Charles McCarthy, director of
animal welfare at the National Institutes
of Health, “We get 25 complaints a year.
We do investigate. Since I981, we have
shut down six labs."

. In 1986, for example, the Institutes
shut down most of the animal labs at the
medical school of Columbia University
in New York. An unannOunced inspec-
tion showed that the labs were not tak-
ing good care of the animals. Under threat
of losing millions of dollars in research
funds, the university cleaned up its act
and its labs within three months. The
labs are now operating again, complete
with an oversight committee.
But Martin Stephens. director of The

as California and New York, federal inspectors can’t ?
make it to half the research sites in a given year.

Dennis Stark of The Rockefeller University in New
York, who devotes his time to seeking tests that ex-
clude animals, contends that one brutal case of ani-
mal research shOuld not lead to condemnation of the
whole system. “We have our bad scientists,” he says,
“just as we occasionally have bad teachers, bad judges ,
bad cops and bad Presidents.”

Animal -rights advocates like Cleveland Amory, presi-
dent and founder of the Fund for Animals, would like
to see nearly all animal research eliminated. Amory,
a fellow editor of PARADE, says, “In my heart, I’m
an anti-vivisectionist. In my head, I know animal re—
search will go on for a long time. Basically, I want to
see it mitigated. I want ground rules and foul lines.”

“We are opposed to medical research on animals,”
he adds , “but we have to be pragmatic. There are some
absolutely essential areas of medicine, like cancer and
transplants, that so far apparently have had to use ani-
mals. But I want to see it come down, step by step.”
; Researchers ﬁnd this stance unsettling. They ask
' who would be willing to try a drug whose effects,
toxicity and proper dose had been untested in animals.

Donald Kennedy, president of Stanford University
and a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, reflects the widespread concern of
researchers. “Almost everything we have learned about
human disease and its treatment in the last century has
had its roots in animal research,” says Kennedy, cit-
ing insulin for diabetes, the Salk polio vaccine and
numerous other examples. “If all use of animals was
prohibited, it would end drug and vaccine develOp-
ment, new surgical procedures and much of the basic
research on genetic diseases in children.”

Indeed, research has turned a corner for muscular

dystrophy, the deadly disease for which Jerry Lewis
has raised millions. Scientists have discovered the gene
responsible for Duchenne, one form of the muscle
disease. Donald Wood, director of research for the
Muscular Dystrophy Association, says the gene also ;
exists in dogs, cats, mice and many other animals.

“We have all the key components,” says Wood. “We
know the cause of the human disease, and we have a
wealth of animal models. It’s the best situation. We
would be greatly stalled without animals.”

There are, of course, extremists in both camps. Some
scientists minimize the inadequate controls on the use
of animals. Some animal advocates go so far as to
break into laboratories, steal records, destroy equip-
ment, kidnap animals and even bomb the labs.

In recent years, the number of break-ins with kid-
napping and vandalism has risen sharply. The scien-
tists call this terrorism. Ingrid Newkirk, president of
PETA, counters that the break-ins are pointed against
the terrorism in the labs.

The new movement against animal research takes
its impetus from the Australian philosopher Peter
Singer. Singer argues that animals , like humans , have
rights, not to be exploited by humans. And Newkirk
argues that a dog is the moral equal of a boy, that
neither can be used inhumanely for human beneﬁt.

There is a cost: The Department of Agriculture
estimates that the new rules improving care for ani-

mals, part of a 1985 farm bill, will cost $100 million a ‘
year. And the attacks on labs have resulted in increased 1

expenses for security.

Each year hundreds of thousands of pet owners give
up their animals to animal shelters, to be adopted or
killed. Most are killed. Less than 2 percent of these
animals ever go to research. Nevertheless, laws in
a dozen states now forbid the use of impounded ani-
mals—particularly dogs and cats-—-for research.

The Humane Society of the United States opposes

 

 

 

using shelter animals for research. It fears that once
word gets out that some animals go for research, peo-
ple won’t use the shelters.

. Dr. A. Clifford Barger, professor emeritus of phys-
iology at Harvard Medical School, says his research
wrll probably stop without the pound animals. For 40
years, he has used dogs from the pound to explore
kidney problems and high blood pressure.

Animal advocates fear that some species will dis-
appear tf they are too heavily used for research. Jane
Goodall , the primate researcher, worries about the loss
of chimpanzees to the ever-burgeoning research on
AIDS. Of all animals, chimps stand closest biologi-
cally to human beings. “There are perhaps 100,000 to
175,000 chimpanzees left in Central Africa,” says
Goodall, who has lived among these animals in the
wild. “If there is an enormous demand for them, it
Will spell the end of the chimpanzees.”

People with illnesses who feel that the findings of
animal research saved them from death also are speak-
ing out. Most notable are members of a group called
iiFAR—Incurably Ill for Animal Research.

Steve Carroll, iiFAR’s executive director, says he

 

‘ owes his life to animal research. Badly burned and

with a compound leg fracture from a plane accident in
1971, Carroll was kept alive with pigskin grafts and
animal-tested respirators, painkillers and antibiotics.
“Without animal testing ,” he says , “I wouldn’t be here.”

How and if the issue will be resolved remains to be
seen, but there is no question that, in the meantime,
the animals are beneﬁting. The; get better care, and
more scientists are sensitive to their discomfort—if
only because of the ﬁnancial and other threats posed
by animal advocates.

-A great many scientists welcome the concern for
lab animals. “We agree with the desire to make re- '
search less painful, to take good care of and to reduce
the number of animals in experiments ,” maintains Dr.
James B. Wyngaarden, head of the National Insti-
tutes of Health. “That’s not only humane, it’s good
science. Poorly treated animals give us had science.”

And Martin Stephens of The Humane Society of
the United States , acknowledges , “We have to be hon—
est and recognize that there have been some benefits
from animal research. But our ultimate goal is the
complete replacement of animals.”

'; Part of the reason may be that

_‘ ‘Ijlivu is still pretty young to be hav- ‘

Porton noted that gorillas of her
species usually wouldn’t bear off-
spring for another year or two —-:
.nor would they space them so close
together. .

Kivu’s first baby, a male named
Mshindu, was born Oct. 17. In the
wild, Porton said, gorilla moms
generally nurse their offspring for
up to four years and dOn't breed in
the meantime.

Mshindi was raised in the nu‘rs--

ery, but has been spending more
time around his mother for the last
several months.

“:If she does accept Mshindi, then
she’ might accept this new one,”
Porton said. "At about five months,

look like and smell like and act

The western lowland gorilla is an
endangered species. Those at the

'St. Louis Zoo are on a breeding loan
from the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chi-

cago as part of a program to re-
plenish the species in captivity.

Under the care of his human
keepers, the new gorilla is putting
on weight. He weighed 4 pounds 13
ounces when he was taken to the
nursery, .but Tuesday morning he
weighed 6 pounds, 8.5 ounces.

As with his younger brother, it is
unknown which of the two male go-
rillas is the father —— Fred, who is
estimated to be 29 years old, or
Fred’s son; J OJ 0, 8.

Porton said zoo officials plan to
do blood tests on the mother, child
and two males to determine
paternity. . .

Animal appointments will be the
appropriate accessories to formal wear
at ZOO-FAR] Under the Stars,
Friday at the Phoenix Zoo, 5810 E.

“Black tie and formal gowns
topped with fantasy masks will be the
dress of the evening,” said Philip H.
Darrow, ZOO-FARI committee mem-
ber. “Tails, horns, ears, even claws are
acceptable.

“Or wear entire animal costumes.
We urge guests to be creative.”

Darrow said there will be entertain-
ment throughout the evening, 6 pm.
to midnight, with everything from
African dance ensembles to magicians,
and dance music from ’403 swing to
rhythm-and-blues.

“We may not be able to talk to the
animals, but we can feast with the
beasts,” he said. “There will be, ahem,
grazing at stations throughout the
zoo. Some 37 of the Valley’s most
prestigious restaurants and other
sponsors are donating their specialties
of food and spirits, from Southwestern
to Cajun styles.”

A sampling: Le Relais will serve a
variety of appetizers, both Gregory’s
of Scottsdale and Royal Viking Line
have planned “Epicurean surprises,”
Avanti Restaurant will present its veal
meatballs and Marriott‘s Camelback
Inn will provide a dessert assortment.

There is no mention of bear steaks,
lion chops or camel canapés.

" “This is our first ZOO-FARI, but it
will be an annual event,” Darrow
said. “Donations start at $110 per
person for Ravens and go up to Eagles
at $7,500, which includes admission
for 24 peOple, preferential tables and
their own personal bar and bartender.

“All but $10 per person is tax-de-
ductible, thanks to our sponsors,” he
said. “We hope to raise at least
$155,000 to aid the 200’s free
educational programs, which ,serve
more than 40,000 schoolchildren
every year.”

The evening also will honor Mrs.
Scott L. Libby Jr., one of the zoo’s
founders.

The zoo, which opened in 1962,
receives more than 1 million visitors
each year and is second only to Grand
Canyon National Park as Arizona‘s
most visited attraction, Darrow said.

gations are Ongoing,” he said. “Every
effort will be made to bring these peo—
ple to justice.”

Mr. Leakey said the ministry plans
to intensify training for wildlife offi-
cers in game parks to help them be
more effective in combatting poachers.

Kenya stepped up its efforts against
poaching in August after the Wildlife
Ministry reported that illegal hunters
had killed 92 elephants and cut their
tusks. Paramilitary forces were sent
‘ into the parks to reinforce rangers, and
President Daniel arap Moi ordered
poachers shot on sight.

Since then, the poachers have killed
five rangers and security officers in

'l

 

 

armed confrontations in the parks. One
poacher has died.

Twenty-three elephants are also rev.

the crackdown on poaching, although

could be twice that.
Huge Loss of Animals

In the last 15 years, Kenya’s elephant
population has dropped by 85 percent,
according to the United Nations Envi—
ronment Program —— much of it the re,

 

sult of poaching, much of the rest from 1

environmental damage like the loss of
trees and other natural habitat.

An aerial survey in February of
Kenya‘s vast southeastern Tsavo Na-
tional Park and the surrounding area
found 5,363 elephants, down from an
estimated 35,000 in 1974.

Fashionable SynthEtics
Otter an Alternative

By Marylin Johnson
Staff Writer
In the beginning, God created fur -— and for the last
'30-odd years, man has struggled to make synthetic fur
; look as much like the genuine article as possible, to the
delight of animal conservationists and animal rights ad-
‘ vocates, who are against using wildlife for fashion

ii“;

iiirpurposes. ‘ . .
Faux furs have always been a small part of the fash-
ion picture, especially in Europe. Designers such as So~
ma Rykiel, Claude Montana, and Byblos regularly show
faux fur jackets and coats, to be worn as fashion looks
g‘on their own. Several American manufacturers who
have lines of fashion-forward synthetic furs include
"jifﬂiller Bros. & Hiller lnc., Donnybmok, Adorable Coat
figand Dubrowsky & Perlbinder. ~
Mark Becker, a spokesman for Adorable Coat, said
his imitation for business is op 75 percent from last sea
son. “thinner: haven’t seen fake: furs in severai years.”
J1e said. “Now they look new again. Also, the fiber qualin
Qty of the acrylics and the modacrylics, from which the
Effgarments are made, have greatly improved over the
ifyears.” Prices for synthetic furs range from $99 to $150,
which, as Mr. Becker pointed out, is considerably less
than the price for a real fur. - ' -
At Hiller Bros. & Hiller Inc, manmade coats are
selling, “because they are warm, practical, lightweight
: and attractive,” according to president Bob Hiller. “And
‘ they are reasonably priced.” His firm cuts 60 styles of
faux leopard, mink, raccoon, seal and jaguar out of
acrylic fabrics, which are bought in France as well as in
, the United States. Prices range from $125 to $300.
._ ‘ Atlantan Caryl Bryan, owner of Bless the Beasts in
. Roswell, is a strong believer in synthetic furs as alterna-
tives to real furs. Three years ago, she opened her shop
because she could not find a well-made simulated fur

"Z coat at a reasonable price. Today, in addition to faux’

furs, Ms. Bryan stocks ivory reproductions, recycled pa-
per products, stuffed animals and animal figurines.
“Nothing’l carry in the shop has died or had to be

sacriﬁced,” said Ms. Bryan “I’m trying to make people.

‘ more aware of the exploitation
of animals. And wearing a fur is one
of the worst atrocities that we in-
flict on our fellow creatures.”

To this end, Ms. Bryan allows no
one to come into her shop in an au»
thentic fur, and she has buttons
made to wear on her fakes that say,
“No animal died to make this coat.”

“I feel that wearing a look-alike
fur is the ultimate compliment to
the animal,” said the shop owner.
“One can enjoy the way it looks
without sacriﬁcing the animal.” Ms.
Bryan’s “furs” include look-alike
minks, foxes, raccoons, snow leop-
ards and seals, priced from $99 to
$445.
Priscilla Feral, president of
Friends of Animals, an internation-
al animal protection organization,
doesn’t even recommend wearing a
synthetic fur. m

“i want to resist. looking like a
dead zrrnimal,” she said in a phone
interview from her Connecticut 0f-
fice. "By wearing even a fake ani-
mal skin, one simply perpetuates
the myth they are desirable to put
on your back.” As alternatives, Ms.
Feral suggests wearing cotton par-
kas and jackets with polyester-filled
linings since they are quite warm
and lightweight. _ -

A growing number of people
like Ms. Feral see the wearing of
furs as immoral and barbaric. Cur-
rently, there are more than 200 ani-
mal rights and animal welfare
groups in the United States that
condemn the trapping and killing of

wild animals.

According to The Humane Soci-
ety of the United States of America,
there are two ways-to obtain fur
pelts. One is the steel-jaw leg-hold
trap. which shuts tightly around the
animal’s leg, like a car door slain
ming on your finger. The Society es-
timates that a minimum of 15 mil-
lion are trapped by this method in
the United States.

“One of our main goals is to out-
law this trap,” said Atlantan Lou
Regenstein, who is a conservation-
ist active with The Fund for Ani-
mals. “It’s incredibly cruel, since it
catches anything that comes along.
Children have been crippled by it,
even eagles can get caught. Often
animals chew off their leg, called
‘wring-off‘ in the trade, to escape.
The majority of wild animals that
are trapped are caught in these leg-
hold traps.”

Another fur pelt source is the

ranch- or farm-raised animal. Minks ’
. and foxes are often bred in captivi-

ty, but animal rights groups don’t
approve of this method either.
“Ranch—raising is just as gruesome
as the leg-hold traps,” said Cheryl
McAuliffe, the southeastern coordi-
nator for The Fund for Animals.
“Often a wild animal is raised in a
cage so tiny it can barely move
around. And the methods used in
killing - clubbing, poisoning, elec-

1 trocution -- are very cruel.”

As might be expected, furriers
and trappers take a different point
3f view.

“Many animal populations must
be controlled by trapping or hunting
in order to protect human activities
in developed areas,” said Thomas
Riley, spokesperson for The Fur
Retailers Information Council in
Washington, DC. “Bears destroy
bee hives, coyotes —— as well as

bears -- kill livestock, raccoons raid T

cornfields, hungry deer and elk rav-

age winter-stored hay, beavers flood ,

farmland and roadways, and foxes,
,minks and weasels have a taste for
domestic poultry.
__ “Furbearers are largely noctur-
trial and are generally taken late at
night or early in the morning with a
variety of types of traps. In many ar-
eas, it is now required by law that
live-holding traps be visited every
24 hours. Most furbearers are
,’ aquatic or semi-aquatic, including
beaver, muskrat, mink and otter.
These can be taken in special wa-
. ter—set traps that ensure death with-
in minutes. The Conibear trap is

. also popular because it assures a

quick kill. Snares and live-catch box
traps are also used.”

Mr. Riley also said new trapping

3 systems are researched and ana-
' lyzed in an ongoing effort to identify
Q improvement in humane and effec—
i tive methods. These new techniques
‘: include the padded~jaw trap and
live traps.

Q Certain states, such as Louisi-
,ana, depend on trapping to protect
2its environment. .

we could not trap ir the

msxhlands, a large. poring-3": of
coastal Louisiana would be affect-
ed,” said Greg Linscombe, a biolo-
gist for the Louisiana Department
_ of Wildlife and Fisheries. “The to-
;tal loss of marsh vegetation would
;be phenomenal. This would mean
f not merely the loss of the fur indus—
, try of the state. but also a loss to our
: seafood industry and a loss of habi-
tat essential to migratory waterfowl
, and to hundreds of other species of
' birds and mammals dependent on
these wetlands.”

“Carbon monoxide or carbon di-
oxide gas, contained in pressurized
bottles, is the most widely accepted
killing or harvesting method for
mink,” said Bob Buckler, executive
director of the Coalition. “The spa

f cial airtight container is brought in
‘the cagesito ”minimize stress from

-~-v.«=.s._z.xea.-.-—._.... ._ . ._- . .. .. ..... .

A handling. The animals die instanta—

neously and in a painless manner.
Due to the larger physical size of _
fox, electrocution or lethal injection
are the most humane and effective
methods of instant cardiac arrest.

“Also, mink and fox require ex-
cellent care and nutrition if they
are to thrive. If conditions are not
adequate, fur quality would be the
first thing to suffer. For this reason,
fur farmers probably keep the. best-
cared-for domestic animals in the
world.” '

So, the controversy between ani-
mal rights activist and furrier con-
tinues. And it does not appear to
end anytime soon. The ultimate de—
cision about whether to wear real
or faux fur rests with the consumer.

 




CATS Magazine — Oct. 1988

SAD STATE

Frightening! That is the only
word I can think of to describe
information in the article “No Cats
Allowed” by Phil Maggitti in July
CATS. I live in a small town in
which much of the farmland is
being sold and “improved”. This is
a polite way of letting some ﬁll
their pockets and destroy much of
the fauna of this region in the
name of “progress”.

It is a sad state of affairs when
the people of San Rafael,
California can be hoodwinked into
believing that a ban on cats is the
answer to preserving the Califor-
nia clapper wail bird and the salt
marsh harvest mouse. Not only
will the ban on cats be as
successful as Prohibition, but it is
only a smoke screen thrown up by
the developers to point the ﬁnger
away from their destruction of the
surrounding land.

Marvin E. Carley

POINT MISSED

I think one of the sillier events
recently occurring in Marin
County has been the banning of
cats from the proposed housing
development situated adjacent to
wetlands in San Rafael (“No Cats
Allowed”) by Phil Maggitti, July
CATS. The reason for this feline
excommunication purports to be
the presence of the two endangered
species (California clapper rail and
the salt marsh mouse), and the fear
that cats would harm these
creatures and/or their habitat.
Well, they might.

My criticism is that cats
shouldn’t be given all or even the
majority of the blame for
endangerment. In a more reason-
able world, the city of San Rafael
would not allow 200 homes to be
located so close to an environ-
mentally sensitive area. Also, what
about dogs? Leash laws notwith-
standing, they are less easy to
conﬁne than cats, and their ability
to disturb habitat and nesting

areas is at least as great.

What should have been said
about dirt bikes and their ability to
disrupt and erode? How about the
problem of runoff from herbicides
and pesticides, so endemic to
suburban development? What
should be done about increased
traffic and auto emissions

generated by this and similar
developments?

It is at least ridiculous, if not
illegal, to force homeowners to-
form posses and track down little
kitties as part of the project
conditions. What will their
children think? Is such a
requirement enforceable? What if
these people refuse to play
vigilante? Will they be banished,
along with the cats?

The city of San Rafael and the
developers have really missed the
point. Giving cats a bad 'rap is a
frivolous substitute for addressing
the serious problems of this project.

Photographs byﬂll Freedman/Matrix

HEN photographer Jill Freedman was
growing up in Pittsburgh, she says, “there’s
only one thing I wanted that I didn’t get
— a dog.” Perhaps for that reason, she has
intermittently shot pictures of dogs
throughout her career. “They’re my favorite
species, including us,” Freedman says.
“When I ﬁrst came to New York, I did ﬁnally
get a dog —— a shaggy poodle named Fang.
He became my only photography teacher. He
taught me a lot about really seeing.” In
Freedman’s pictures on these pages, the dog
poking his nose out the door was snapped
in Ireland, the ﬂying doberman and the
locked-out shepherd were shot in
Greenwich Village and the baleful hound and
the inquisitive bulldog at a dog hotel in '
uptown Manhattan. Freedman has turned
out ﬁve books, of photographs, including
collections on subjects ranging from street
cops to Irish scenes. “I’d like to put
together a book of my dog pictures
someday,” Freedman says. “That way,

every dog in the world could say: ‘That’s us.

How’d she' know?’ ” .

Mass . farmers fear livestock measure

By John Larrabee
USA TODAY

LINCOLN, Mass. — Stan White, one
of the last full-time farmers left in this
Boston suburb, raises his livestock the
' old-fashioned way.

'N

His hogs
and beef cat-
tle feed on
natural
grains. His
veal calves
are nour-
ished on
their moth-
ers’ milk,
never formu-
la. He boasts
‘ their meat is
“the best you’ll ﬁnd.”

80 why is he staunchly opposed to a
statewide ballot amendment calling
for “humane treatment” of livestock?
Because the law’s requirements
haven’t been set and White doesn’t
want to buy a pig in a poke.

, “It could be devastating,” he says of

the standards to be set by a board that
includes animal rights activists. “No
one’s going to invest $100,000 in a
farm —- not with this kind of regula-
tion looming over their head.”

signatures to put the measure on the
ballot —— charge veal calves are con-
ﬁned in stalls so narrow they can’t
turn around; hens are crowded into
cages; unwanted baby chicks are suf-
focated in plastic bags.

“It’s not Old McDonald’s farm any-
more,” supporter Evelyn Kimber
says.

Opponents say such methods may
be used in large agricultural states,
but seldom in Massachusetts, where

By Julie Stacey, USA TODAY

most farms are small, family-run op-
erations like White’s.

State Agriculture Commissioner
August Schumacher foresees in-
creased farming costs: “It’s unneces-
sary, unworkable and unfair.”

Voters apparently disagree. A re-
cent Boston Herald poll shows 55 per-
cent will vote for it

Midwest agri-businesses are watch-
ing closely; the initiative could set a
precedent for other states. No other

 

 

state has passed such broad regula-
tions, but measures for raising veal
are pending in New York. Companies,
like Provimi Veal and Brown Packag-
ing, are contributing money to ﬁght it.
Farmer George Mullen fears he
could be stopped from cutting off
sheep’s tails or trimming chickens’
beaks, practices that ensure their
health: “It’s just plain silly.”
Initiative supporters, like Steve
Ronan, say no one would be forced
out of business. “It could open up new
markets for local farmers. People
want to buy food that’s produced un-
der humane conditions,” Ronan says.

The false killer whales. spotted
by a helicopter on Sunday in
Augusta, 170 miles south of

Seven had already died, and
l the 16 still alive were destroyed

because conservationists decided

“They were in pitiful condi-
'tion. A lot were half buried in the
sand, wind-blasted and with blis-

ing them was the only humane
and reasonable thing to do.”

DENVER POST - September 30, 1988

Zoo tiger gets ractianetive implants
in effort to arrest cancerous tumor

By Alan Gottlieb
Denver Post Staff Writer

Apollo,the Denver Zoo’s ailing
16-year-old Bengal tiger, is radio-
active today. Within a few weeks,
though, he should be radiating good
health again.

On Thursday, Porter Memorial
Hospital radiation oncologist Dr.
David Schreiber implanted several
radioactive isotopes in a cancerous
tumor on the roof of Apollo’s
mouth. The radioactive pellets will.
stay in the tiger’s tumor until Tues-
day. -

If all goes well, the radiation will
deal the tumor a mortal blow, and
the cancer will be dead and gone
within three months.

During two and a half hours of
surgery, Schreiber, ' assisted by
Denver Zoo veterinarian Richard
Cambre, performed a recently de-
veloped cancer treatment called
radiation interstitial hyperthermic
implantation. _

Theoretically, by directly bom-
barding the tumor first with heat

and then with radiation, the treat-
ment. should cure Apollo of the can-
cer that has sapped his strength
and gnawed 40 pounds off his 360-
pound frame.

It has worked well on humans,
according to Schreiber, who per-
forms the procedure on people an
average of twice a week. The tech-
nique was approved for use in hu-
man patients about two years ago.

The combination of heat and ra-
diation is effective, Schreiber ex-
plained, because heat destroys a
protein that allows cancer cells to
repair themselves after they are
damaged by radiation.

Although heat and radiation im-
plants have been used frequently
on pets at the Colorado State Uni-
versity school of medicine'in re-
cent years, Thursday’s operation
was believed to be the first time
such a procedure has been per-
formed on a zoo animal.

The procedure involved insertion

of five hollow nylon tubes into the
tumor. Thin microwave antennae

and censors then were slipped into
the tubes. The tumor was heated
by microwave to 110 degrees for 45
minutes.

The censors and antennae then
were removed, leaving the hollow
tubes in place. Apollo, under heavy
sedation, Was wheeled to an isola-
tion cage. There, Schreiber insert-
ed thin wire containing radioactive
beads into the tubes.

Before the isotopes were insert-
ed, Dr. Peter Emily, consulting
dentist to the zoo, slipped a hard
plastic prosthetic device over the
tumor to prevent Apollo from de-
stroying the implants.

Emily fitted the device, which
resembles a retainer worn by orth-
odontic patients, by taking a plas-
ter cast of Apollo’s mouth, then
molding the plastic to it. '

If all goes well, Schreiber said,
the tumor should be gone within
three months. Blood tests indicate
the cancer hasn’t spread, so Apollo
should enjoy several more years of
glowing good health.

N evade Horse Slayers Being Hunted

By George Snyder
Chronicle North Bay Bureau

_ Federal and state authori-
ties in Nevada are hunting for
outlaw riflemen who have
slaughtered at least 130 wild
horses on remote stretches of
government rangeland.

f‘We have opened a major law
enforcement investigation,” said
federal Bureau of Land Manage-
ment spokesman Bob Stewart in
Carson City. “But so far we have no
suspects.”

A total of $12,000 in reward

- money is being offered for the cap-

ture of the horse killers by the Ne-
vada Commission for the Preserva-
tion of the Wild Horse, the North-
ern Nevada Humane Society, the
Wild Horse Organized Assistance
Committee and the Animal Protec~

tion Institute.

Stewart said his agency \vas '

contacted in early Angust by a pri-
vate helicopter pilot from Elke who
said he had spotted dozens'of mus-
tang carcasses while flying over
Lander County in the rolling high
desert country.

. “We had a hard time finding
the dead animals when they were
reported,” "Stewart said. “But once
we found them by air we went in by
four-wheeldrive and investigated
the area. ”

Stew art said BLM investigators
found 44 dead horses in the juniper
country 30 miles north of Austin —
a town of about 200 he described as
being on “Highway 50, the loneliest
road in the world and a long way
from anywhere ” He said and an
additional 87 carcasses were found
on the south side of Mount Moses,
about 30 miles to the west.

Wild horses have been protec-
ted by federal statute since the ear-
ly 19705 after many years of slaugh-
ter. The Bureau of Land Manage
ment, which now is responsible for

protecting the nations estimated

43,000 wild horses, controls about 68
percent of Nevada’s 48 million
acres. Most of the land is leased to
the state’s 639 registered cattlemen.
many of whom still view the wild
mustangs as competition to their

‘ cattle.

Take Care of Humans Before Worrying About Animals

In your Sept. 15 issue, there is an
article concerning alleged abuse of
horses used to pull carriages for sight—
seers in the downtown area. This is but
one in a long series of so-called “ani-
mal rights” stories that have been ap-
pearing in numerous media. It is about
time some sanity is injected into the
animal rights movement.

Throughout this country, many peo-
ple live in horribly substandard hous-
ing, have rats nipping at their toes and
lack enough food to eat. And, as we
have all been reminded lately, many
Americans have no homes or food at all
and must rely on the catch-as-catch-can
charity available to them. We were
shocked recently by the baby who was
born in the restroom of a jetliner and
whose mother left the newborn in the
toilet to live or die. As long as these
kinds of problems beset peopIe, it is
hard for me to get particularly con-
cerned over whether or not a draft
horse has the proper temperature in its
stable or gets weary from pulling a
carriage.

It seems that urbanites in particu-
lar, whose interaction with animals is
often limited to pets, refuse to remem-

her that animals have served mankind
as tools for ages, and not merely as
powderpuffs to play with on the couch
before going to bed. There is nothing
wrong with using animals for work, or
for medical experiments, or otherwise
utilizing and husbanding them as the
resources that they are. »

Lest I appear too harsh, I must say
that I am a pet owner and heartily
agree that cruelty to animals is not to
be condoned; however, in recent years
the definition of “cruelty” has been
stretched beyond all reason. I do not
think mankind owes animals the cour-
tesy of treating them as equals, as many
animal rights’ activists now espouse. I,
for one, believe that human beings are
fundamentally different from animals,
and the last 4,000 years of Western cul-
ture, philosophy and science tend to
agree with me.

As long as children of Appalachia’s
poor slosh through the snow without
shoes on their feet, I think it inappro-
priate that we worry so much about
whether or not horses in downtown At-
lanta have proper shoes on their feet.

Curb on Bear WatChing Leaves Uneasy Truce

 

PACK CREEK, Alaska, Sept. 26
(AP) — Across 20 feet of ankle—deep
water, Charlie Land stared at a brown
bear sow.

, The bear stared back. She scratched
5, her side, then lunged at Mr. Land. He
f filled the shrinking gap with a pink
‘ cloud of hot-pepper aerosol spray, a
sort of natural tear gas, and the bear
wheeled back to her side of the stream.

Again she scratched, then ambled off
across the tidal flat.

Mr. Land backed up the gravel spit
he was defending, then turned to the
three people a dozen steps behind him,
here on a trip to see the animals.

“She didn’t mean it,” he said. “She
wasn’t serious.”

Mr. Land shrugs off such confronta-
tions as part of his job with the Alaska
Department of Fish and Game, enforc-
ing an uneasy truce between man and

bear at one of the few places where the ‘

species willingly meet.
Larger Than Grizzlies

Pack Creek flows into a narrow
ocean inlet from a steep valley on Ad-
miralty Island, about 30 miles south of
Juneau. The island has the greatest
density anywhere of Alaskan brown
bears, which are also known as Kodiak
bears. The largest carnivore on earth,
they are capable of growing to more
than 1,500 pounds.

Late each summer about 30 bears
congregate at Pack Creek, splashing
through the shallows in pursuit of
spawning salmon and grazing in the
surrounding meadow.

The interlopers, game officials say,
are the wildlife watchers, whose eager-
ness to capture bears on film is crowd-
ing this corner of wilderness.

Pack Creek is one of three places in
Alaska where people can readily vvatch
brown bears. The two others are so
popular the state has placed a limit on
visitors at one and established a lottery
for permits to the other. Now Pack
Creek is being overwhelmed.

By Boat and Plane

Up to 60 people a day gather on the
gravel spit near the creek’s mouth.
Yachts cruise offshore; bush planes
. buzz in and out. In 1981, 100 people
came to Pack Creek; last year there
were more than 990.

Until this year visitors and bears
chased each other at. Pack Creek, the
people in pursuit of photographic tro-
phies, the bears guarding prime spots

 

 

on the salmon stream. :
Gradually, the bears have grown ;
bolder, chasing people off the spit. and
carrying away packs and food. Biolo-
gists learned from maulings in national
parks that once had garbage dumps
that bears become most dangerous
when they associate people with food.

”We think we have a bomb there and
it’s ticking,” said Ken Mitchell, the
United States Forest Service’s director
for the Admiralty Island Nationl Monu—
ment.

Mr. Mitchell supports a plan that
Forest Service and state game officials
put into effect this year designating the ,

 

spit as human turf and leave the rest of

‘ Pack Creek to the bears. The authori~
ties hope the boundary will keep people
from being mauled and bears from
being killed.
But some bear watchers are furious.
“The bears are all used to people and

g they’re busy fishing. They don’t mind .
; that they plan to limit commercial

you,” said John Tillinghast, a lawyer
from Juneau who visited the creek one
recent weekend.

Mr. Tillinghast said it used to be easy
to come away from Pack Creek with a
standard prize: “Mom and cubs with a
50-millimeter lens and you didn’t
have any baby sitter from Fish and 1
Game watching you either.”

The bear that lunged at Mr. Land ——

'called “Pest”,with reason —— prompted
the establishment of the boundary be-
tween people and bears. In 1987, a For-
est Service letter file grew fat with re-
ports of bold advances by bears along
the creek, mostly Pest.

Less Drastic Measure

Forest Service staffers at Pack
Creek pleaded with Mr. Mitchell to do
something. “None of us wants to see.
Pest killed, but we feel some action
must be taken soon to prevent more in-
cidents,” they wrote, suggesting the
creek be closed to people.

In July 1987, the Forest Service and

 

the Alaska Fish and Game Department
announced Pest would be killed. When
the anticipated protests came, they
began work on the less drastic plan.
Stan Price, an 88—year—old who lives
on the creek, is a leader of the fight

l

 

against. the boundary rule. Since Mr.
Price built his cabin and floated it onto
the remote banks of Pack Creek more
than 30 years ago he has sharedthe
creek with dozens of bears and raised
orphan cubs.

‘Here Before We Were’

“lt burns me up,” Mr. Price said of
the new rules. “1 can’t say what a
hair’s worth. 1 can’t say what a bear’s
goo. for. But 1 know they were here be-
for c- we were.” .

He said that he had had little conflict
with the bears that, wander into his
cabins and woodsheds and that he had
been injured by one only once. .

Mr. Price said the Forest SerVice
and ,the Fish and Game Department
had exaggerated the danger so people
would believe they needed protection.
Then in the name of safety the agenCies

- can charge admission, he said.

Officials of the Forest Service say

tours, which now account for more
than half the visitors, and that they are
considering a fee to cover the cost of
monitoring Pack Creek, estimated at
more than $20,000 a year. They say
they have no intent of making a profit.

State and Federal officials have said
that if the beiindary system does not
work they will relocate Pest and, if she
returns to Pack Creek and causes trou-
ble, she will be killed.

Someday, Mr. Mitchell said, there
will he need for an observatory where
hundreds of people can go to watch the
bears’ annual-fishing binge. But it will
not be at Pack Creek, he said.

“If there are such viewing areas,”

Mr. Mitchell says, “they probably :

shouldn’t. be in wilderness.”

Bobcats to Return _.
To Cumberland Island

By Steve Goldberg
Staff Writer

ATHENS 4— For Michael J. Conroy, one of the.
best reasons for bringing bobcats back to Cumber—
land Island is perhaps the simplest - they belong
there.
' “Wilderness without a predator is an aberration.
Most people who go on the island will never see a
bobcat. but just knowing it’s there, seeing a track or
other sign, is going to be exciting,” he said.
“Bobcats belong on the island as part. of the ex-
perience,” said Dr. Conroy, an assistant wildlife
leader at the University of Georgia.
Dr. Conroy, along with Dr. Robert J. Warren, a,
UGA colleague, plans to release five of the wildcats
on Cumberland Monday as part of a National Park
Service project to reintroduce a native, warmblood—
ed predator to the island. Five additional releases
are proposed over the next 15 months, so that, by the
end ol'1989, Cumberland will be home to 30 bobcats.
Snakes, birds and alligators are the only preda-
tors currently on Cumberland, the southernmost of
the state's barrier islands and a federally protected
seashore since 1972. g ,

land was in 1907, after most had
died of disease or been killed by
hunters. Local residents talk of a
time in the early 19705 when some-
one supposedly set five of the cats _
loose on the island, but officials say ‘5
that if that’s true, none survived.
Bobcats can be up to twice the
size of a house cat; males reach a
maximum weight. of about 21
pounds. The bobcats to be placed ‘
on Cumberland would be trapped .
from among the wild population
along the mainland coast. ‘
The bobcats, which will be fit- ‘
ted with radio-transmitter collars
and tracked for two years, will give
UGA researchers a unique opportu—
nity to study the behavior of wild
animals in a closed, natural envi-
ronment, said Dr. Warren, an asso-

Ciate professor of wildlife manage- ;

ment.

Wild piglets, rabbits, squirrels.
raccoons and other small mammals
will be the bobcats’ primary prey,
he said, although the cats are also
expected to kill some of the island’s
white-tailed deer and wild turkeys.

The matter of prey sparked a
minor controversy alone the coast
last month after the Park Service
released its initial environmental
assessment of the bobcat project,
which is expected to cost about
$150,000.

The report suggested that the
bobcats would be able to control the

 

 

 

island 5 burgeoning deer popul ,'

tzrm a 1 {pr}; rut that inf‘ig
hunters who thought they coul:

a better job during controlledl. .
on the island. About 50 local res;-
dents, many of them hunters, signed
a petition expressing their opposi-
tion to the Park Service plan.

“I want to keep on hunting,"
said Howard Phillips of Woodbine
who led the petition drive. “If they
wanted the deer controlled, we
would take care of them. If they
want 500 deer killed, we’ll kill 500
deer. Why let a bobcat eat a deer
when there‘s people in the county
going hungry? We can give the deer
away to the public.”

City Council members in St. ,
Marys, just across the Intracoastal :

Waterway from the island, also op-
posed the idea of releasing bobcats,

cats were to kill off the wild birds.
the state Department of Natural Re-
sources has- promised to restock the
island with turkeys. No one at the

' meeting spoke out against the bob-

but for a different reason. The E ‘
council voted last month to ask the i ,

federal and state governments to re-
consider their plan, fearing the cats
would wipe out the island’s turkey'
population

However, UGA researchers and
Park Service officials say neither
the hunters nor the council mem-
bers have cause for concern.

At a public meeting on the bob-
cat program here last week, Dr.
Warren told about 25 peOple —
many of whom were also concerned
about the turkeys — that if the bob—

cat project.

As for the deer, the National
Park Service now says it made a
mistake in its initial environmental
assessment.

Although bobcats likely will kill
some deer on the island, it won’t be
enough to make a serious dent in
the deer population, estimated at
2,000, said Russell Galipeau, a natu-
ral resource management specialist
with the Park Service who served
as moderator at last week‘s hearing.

“From the Park Service’s stand-
point. the real reason isn‘t to con-

trol deer, but to introduce a preda- 1
tor for the sake of introducing a i
predator, for biological diversity,”
said Dr. Conroy.

Researchers point out that bob-
cats are opportunistic predators
that kill whatever is most readily
available. Most likely, they say, the
cats will prey on the island's young

 

fawns only in the late spring and

early summer. and then only on the ;
weaker ones that. would have died

anyway.
At most. Dr.

cats are naturally shy animals. and
the chance of an attack is “so re-
mote it‘s infinitesimal," said Dr.
Warren.

Park Service officials say public
comments have been about 60 per-
cent. favorable. Researchers at. UGA
still must receive final approva al
from the Park Service before 1e-
leasing the bobc‘ ts but Dr. Conroy
said he and other researchers fully

 

expect the project to go through.

DID THE ANIMALS
WIN OR LOSE?

by
Phil Maggitti

“Animals are feeling beings, and it is this capacity to
feel which vests them with protectable interests.”
Michigan Humane Society News
October/November 1984

The most indispensable of those interests,
according to David K. Wills, executive director of
the Michigan Humane Society, is the right to
medical attention. “If an animal doesn’t have a
right to veterinary care,” says Wills, “it doesn’t
have any rights at all.” Consequently, at the
three full-service clinics operated by the Michigan
Humane Society, no animal is ever turned away
because its owner cannot afford the bill.

This enlightened approach has helped to raise
the Michigan Humane Society’s proﬁle in the
animal rights community. It has also raised the
hackles of organized veterinary medicine—namely
the Michigan and the American veterinary
medical associations—which, says Wills, “are
working vigorously to outlaw this type of
hospital.”

Veterinarians reply that such is not the case,
but they do insist that not-for-proﬁt, full-service
animal hospitals operated by humane societies
ought to play by the same tax rules that apply
in the private sector. Thus we ﬁnd veterinarians
on the opposite side of the line of scrimmage
from animal rights supporters once again.

This issue this time centers around that

portion of a humane society’s income provided by
full-paying customers. This is a slice that works
to support the rest of the pie, for proﬁts from
full-paying, full-charge customers help subsidize
the cost of providing care for thousands of pets
belonging to less solvent animal lovers. But the
pass-or-fail question that tax-exempt organizations
must answer satisfactorily is not “What do you
do with your proﬁts?” The questions is, “Do you
acquire those proﬁts because you have an unfair
competitive advantage over similar businesses
operating in the private sector?” And if you think
veterinarians are willing to take “Not really” for
an answer where humane societies are concerned,

 

pal ient.

think again.

After failing to convince the Internal Revenue
Service and the Michigan legislature that the
MHS clinics do have an unfair competitive
advantage and ought to be made to pony up on
proﬁts provided by full-paying customers, the
veterinary medical establishment was recently
successful in getting the Subcommittee on
Oversight, which reports to the Ways and Means
Committee of the US. House of Representatives,
to consider its complaint.

So considerate was the subcommittee in
response to veterinary lobbying that it included
among a list of suggested revisions to the
unrelated business income tax statutes a proposal
which would restrict the tax-exempt activities of
humane-society-operated full-service veterinary
clinics. As veterinarians and the Subcommittee on
Oversight would have it, humane societies will be
allowed to operate tax-exempt in the following

 

areas: pet sterilization, emergenI care ancf public
health which includes rabies. .zmts.

That’s the business-as-usual news, business in
which the Michigan Humane Society and others
like it are distinctly not for proﬁt. The bad news
is that humane society clinics would have to pay
various income, property, and wage taxes—at
federal, state, and local levels—on all proﬁts from
cash~on-the-barrel, full-charge transactions. As a
result, they would not be able to treat as many
animals at free or reduced cost as they currently
do.

The Michigan Humane Society thinks this is
a festering boil of an idea, on a par with factory

In photo above is one of the Michigan Humane Society
veterinarians, Dr. Shirenc Cece, weighing in a

farming and the fur trade. “Organized veterinary
medicine is using us as a scapegoat,” declares
Eileen Liska, director of research and legislation
at the MHS. “There are only 12 humane societies
that operate full-service clinics in the United
States, yet veterinarians are running around like
Chicken Little, yelling “‘The sky is falling. These
clinics are putting us out of business.’ ”

For their part, veterinarians think Chicken
Little was right. “This is a big issue,” says John
R. Boyce, D.V.M., assistant director of scientific
activities at 'the AVMA. “And for practicing
veterinarians it’s not a philosophical issue. It’s
business. It’s their livelihood. So you can
understand the concern.”

The clash between veterinarians and humane
societies that operate full—service clinics is part of
a larger war being fought by private business and
tax-exempt organizations on many fronts. Business
consultants, for example, argue that colleges

should not be allowed to offer consulting services
through their computer departments unless they
pay taxes on their proﬁts. Owners of parking lots
don’t want to see a church using some of its
surplus funds to go into the car parking business
without having to pay taxes. In fact, the private
sector complains that not-for-proﬁt organizations
not only have an unfair competitive advantage,
but they are also guilty of overstepping the
bounds of their charitable missions when they
engage in activities not directly related to those
missions. "

Humane societies that operate full-service or
neuter-and-spay clinics are exempt from paying
taxes under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal
Revenue Code. This section exempts organizations
operated exclusively for religious, charitable,
scientific, literary, or educational purposes. It also
exempts organizations attempting to foster
national or international sports competition or to
prevent cruelty to children or animals.

When the Michigan Veterinary Medical
Association complained to the IRS that the MHS
clinics were exceeding their mission by accepting
customers who were able to pay full price, the
IRS went over the activities of the Michigan
Humane Society with the legal equivalent of a
flea comb, but it didn’t find any dirt. On August
30, 1984, the IRS published a Technical Advice
Memorandum relating to the Michigan Humane
Society. “The key Question,” said the IRS, “is
whether the (MHS) has operated its veterinary
service activity in such a fashion as to override
any related purpose.”

In answer to its own question, the IRS

decided that there was “no information suggesting
that elimination of clinical services to animals
whose owners are able to pay could be
accomplished without adversely affecting the
quality of care provided to sick or injured
animals.” Therefore, “the provision of veterinary
services for a fee,” the IRS concluded, “is not
unrelated trade or business. Accordingly, the
income is not subject to tax.” I

In commenting on the IRS decision, David
Wills points out. that the Michigan Humane
Society does not compete unfairly with private
sector vets because it (the MHS) does not
“capture” animal clients through its adoption or
sterilization programs; it does not offer non-
medical services such as grooming, boarding, or
cosmetic surgery; and it does not act in a
consulting capacity to animal breeders. All MHS
services, Wills maintains, are directly related to
its primary mission—the prevention of animal
suffering. Furthermore, with the exception of
sterilization fees, which are purposely kept as low
as possible, MHS fees “are competitive with those
charged by private practitioners in the tricounty
metropolitan Detroit area.”

The Michigan Humane Society and its 23,000
members and financial supporters (since grown to
more than 57,000) had scarcely ﬁnished
celebrating the IRS decision when the MVMA
went looking for a legislative sponsor for a bill
that would have made it illegal in the state of
Michigan for a humane society clinic to accept
full-paying customers. The veterinarians found a
sponsor, but their proposed bill never found its
way before a committee. Second and third efforts
in this regard were also unsuccessful. But as Dr.
Boyce said, “This is a big issue,” and

 

OCTOBER 1988

 

 

 




 

 

 

veterinarians were ﬁnally able to convince the
Subcommittee on Oversight to piggyback their
complaints with the complaints of other
businesses in the private-sector—versus-nonproﬁt-
organizations debate.

“Unfortunately, we got caught up in the
larger issue,” says David Wills. “It’s very unlikely
that the Ways and Means Committee would have
even looked at humane society hospitals if it
hadn’t been for the veterinary profession. I
suspect that what veterinarians really want is not
an end to unfair competition, but an end to any
competition.”

Others suspect that veterinarians are blaming
the wrong “enemy” for their economic troubles.
“The biggest challenge that veterinarians have to
face in the future does not come from humane
societies,” says Pat Owens, executive director of
the Women’s Humane Society in Philadelphia,
which has been the object of veterinarians’ wrath
on occasion. “Their biggest challenge will be
modernizing their own practices. Rather than
chasing us, the AVMA and other organizations
ought to be spending their time educating the
members of their profession and looking at
alternative business solutions.”

The package of unrelated business income tax
revisions that could alter the way the Michigan
Humane Society and others achieve their mission
of preventing animal suffering has not been voted

 

on by the Subcommittee on Oversight; and even if
the package is approved there, it will have to
clear the Ways and Means Committee, the House
of Representatives, the Senate Finance Committee,
the full Senate, and the next president before it
becomes law. Yet if organized veterinary medicine
is ultimately successful in its dogged pursuit of
tax reform, there will be a cruel irony in its
triumph. For in addition to losing with the IRS
in the Michigan Humane Society case,

.veterinarians have also lost in courts in

Pennsylvania and Michigan when they have
brought suit against other humane societies
operating full service clinics. Now, however,
veterinarians hope .to achieve through lobbying
what they haven’t been able to achieve through
one-on-one competition.

If they succeed, the real losers will be animals
owned by people for whom free or low-cost care is
the only affordable kind, because money spent on
taxes is money that can’t be spent on needy
animals, say proponents. “That is why the
Michigan Humane Society will continue to oppose
any efforts to weaken or destroy our veterinary
operations,” wrote William J. Nemeth, D.V.M., in

the Michigan Humane Society News several years

ago. “That is why I am here and will continue to
be here when the battle has died down, and the
question that must be answered is simply, ‘Did

the animals win or lose?” W,

Man, Pet Bond
[Is A Strong One

“Bittersweet” is a way to describe the
feeling one gets after reading letters in
the DeKalb Humane Society’s newsletter.

Frequently, the society prints in this
publication memorial tributes that pet-
lovers send in with their contributions to
' the society.

' Somtimes, these testimonials are in
memory of humans, those “friends of
animals” who have passed away.

Occasionally, there’s a tribute to some.
person has has done a good deed for an
animal or animal-owner. For example, a
recent newsletter writer had lost her blind
cat, and she wrote to praise the woman
who found and cared for it until the cat
and the owner could be reunited.

But, most often, the “memorials” are to
those dogs and cats which have died after
giving long years of loyalty and love to
their owners.

In a recent newsletter, an owner - in a
very moving way -— described how she
acquired and cared for a dehydrated,
wormy “mutt” in 1971 and how that dog
rewarded her with 16 years of friendship
and loyalty.

“There are so many memories that
‘ warm my heart,” she wrote. “I miss her so
much. I only wish for every mutt such a
good life.”

 

MOST ALL of us who’ve enjoyed a dog,
cat or other type of pet for any number of
years can identify with such emotional
tributes.

An animal, by asking so little and
giving so much, easily becomes “part of
the family.” And, its death years later can
leave the owner heartbroken. A replace-
ment pet might eliminate some of the
emptiness, but never the memory of the
departed pet. '

Amazingly, this special bonding be-
tween man and animal can occur even
when there is nothing particularly excep-
tional about the pet. .

In other words, you don’t have to own
Lassie or Mr. Ed to love your pet as if it
really were a family member.

We speak from experience.

Lulu was a rather unremarkable mix-
ture of beagle and something else, adopted
from the DeKalb dog pound in 1975.

l

l

The ﬁve-year-old daughter ”picked her
wt, and she couldn’t have selected an

uglier animal -— bulging eyes, funny ‘

floppy ears and legs so short she looked
the same whether standing or asleep on
her stomach.

She - the dog - developed some bad
habits over the years —— like refusing to go
outside to the restroom during cold, rainy
or snowy weather.

She had a nasty temper, frequently
"attacking other dogs that ventured into
the yard. She never hurt any of them, but
several times, she was nearly killed her-
self.

She was not very smart. Never a real
mother herself, she once tried to adopt

and nurse our cat’s kittens. And, mother '

cat made her pay for that mistake.

She knew no tricks, save for keeping
one particular living room chair cushion
toasty warm. .

Her usefulness was limited. She would
become watchdog and bark at approach-
ing strangers — provided it didn’t inter-
fere with her nap.

1 Hard to please? Not if you fed her

, chicken, macaroni and cheese or chocolate
j -— her favorites — and rubbed her back
i when she walked. by.

’ BUT LIKE many other untalented
dogs, Lulu was strong in the areas that
count. ’

As a companion, she couldn’t be
matched. If a family member were headed
somewhere, she was sure it was her job to
go, too. Wherever one walked, the dog’s
little chin could be felt on the heel. If she
didn’t get to go, she didn’t pout. She
simply would be there at the door, waiting
for you to get back. Greeting an arriving
family member was something she did
best, dancing and prancing until you told
“her enough wasvenough. ‘ '

She was always loyal. Even if
she were scolded, she never looked
at you crossly or held a grudge. No
matter what happened, she was
always there, always a friend.

Love? Who can say what a pet
“feels” for its family. In Lulu’s
case, we never thought about it
much. We just assumed she felt the
same way about us that we did
about her.

Lulu died the other day.

She was overweight -— probably

' from too much cheese and maca-
. roni and chocolate. She couldn’t

exercise either, her legs too little,

f weak and old to run under her

massive body.
Whatever the cause, she died

sleeping peacefully and while she
’ was on her usual job, that of
helping gravity keep the driveway
from floating away.

Her mutt companion, Muppet,

’ the only dog she ever tolerated, is
.. grieving. The kids will miss her.
_ I’ll never forget her.

Many folks ease the pain of

~ losing a close pet by making me-
i morial contributions to animal
: support organizations like the hu-
mane society.

Others put their tributes into
words and have them published
somewhere - or else they store
what they’ve written in a place for
safe keeping. ‘

Whatever. It seems to help.

WAFRUS WATQH: Noisy sightseers and fishermen may be the
culprits m disturbing the mammals’ habitat on Alaskan islands.

Noisy humans disturb
top walrus sanctuary

By The Associated Press

OUND ISLAND, Alaska —

Noisy sightseers and fisher-

men rintruding on the wal-
ruses of Round Island may be
causing the blubbery beasts to de-
fect to the Soviet Union, where
they enjoy more privacy.

Every year, thousands of bull
walruses haul out on the huge
rocks that ring the shore of this
mist-enshrouded island 13 miles off
southwest Alaska. '

The puffing, snorting, hissing
mammals ponderously heave their
two tons of bulk from the frigid Be-
ring Sea and shoulder and poke
their way with their huge ivory
tusks into the overlapping mass of
their thick-skinned brethren.

Each is seeking a place in the
sun, a spot to rest between seven-
to 10-day feeding frenzies.

From a distance, they look like
layers of cinnamon-colored fringe
stitched to the base of the cliffs.
Up close, they look more like be-
whiskered bachelors sleeping off
the effects of a boozy beach party
— eyes closed, heads down, their
bodies oozing into crevices in the
rocks. -

While the males are piled up on
beaches as far south as Kodiak Is-
land and Yakutat Bay, the females

_ A1-..

and their young remain With the
pack ice north of the Bering Strait
and into the Arctic Ocean.

But the number of 'Pacific wal-
ruses that haul out here and in less
er numbers at the other six islands
of the Walrus Islands State Game
Sanctuary has started to decline
again after a spectacular come-
back that peaked in the 19705.

On Round Island they have en-
joyed considerable privacy in the

: past, largely because of the weath-

er and location. The nearest com-
munity is Togiak, 33 miles by char-
ter boat to the northeast.

With increased commercial bot-

 

tom-fishing activity and the pros—
pect of Oil exploration and develop-
ment in salmon-rich Bristol Bay,
that isolation may come to an end.
And that has some professional
walrus watchers concerned.

“Walruses are pretty sensitive to
disturbance,” says Lloyd Lowry, a
marine mammal specialist with
the Alaska Department of Fish and
Game in Fairbanks.

“There’s more than a little con-
cern that the noise caused by the
fishery has adversely influenced
the haul-out. People on the island
say they sometimes can hear the
radios on the bridges of the boats.”

Ken Taylor, another state biolo-
gist, monitors walrus numbers
from his office in Dillingham.

“In the mid-19703, we had as
many as 15,000 animals there,”
Taylor says. “It was 4,400 last year
and about 4,500 now. The difficult
thing is there are so many reasons
for the numbers to go up and down.

“To my mind, the sheer number
of boats out there with motors
droning in the water sets up an
acoustical noise that may be a
cause.”

The two game technicians on
Round Island this summer, Polly
Hessing and Judy Brandt, say they
counted as many as 180 boats in the
area during a peak fishing period
this spring.

Although the vessels were out-
side the two-mile limit established
around the sanctuary, the noise
they made was loud enough to
force the women to close the win-
dows in their cabin so they could
get some sleep.

The state set up the sanctuary in . ‘

1960 to protect the last remaining
walrus hauling grounds in the
south Bering Sea.

Thirty permits a day — half for
overnight and half for day use —
are available for people wishing to
visit the island.

Dolphins, elephants on list

WASHINGTON (AP) —— Bills to
strengthen the effort to save en-
dangered plants, animals and fish
and to give special protection to
African elephants and Pacific dol—
phins were approved by voice
votes Monday in the House.

Sent to the White House was
legislation reauthorizing the En-
dangered Species Act, the 15—year-
old law that is a world model for
saving flora and fauna from extinc-
tion by development.

In separate action, the House
sent the Senate a bill to reauthorize
the 1972 Marine Mammal Protec-
tion Act and initiate a US. program
to curb the mounting losses of dol-
phins to yellowfin tuna fishermen
in the Pacific.

Under the plan, the Commerce
Department would be able to ban
tuna imports from nations that fail
to take steps to reduce the drown-
ing deaths of dolphins in tuna nets
to rates comparable to the US. Pa-
cific tuna fleet.

Dolphins are at risk because
schools of yellowfin tuna are fre-
quently found swimming beneath
dolphins in the eastern Pacific.
Congressional committees have
been told that 115,000 dolphins
died in foreign nets last year, com-
pared with less than 14,000 in US.
nets.

The approval of the Endangered
Species Act reauthorization capped
four years of struggle by congres—
sional environmentalists to

strengthen the basic law and in-
crease funding ceilings for the pro—
tection program.

The legislation, worked out by
House and Senate negotiators,
would authorize, subject to the ap-
propriations process, the spending
of $56 million next year, rising to
$66 million in 1992. The current
levet is about $39 million.

The legislation also would au-
thorize'US. spending of $25 mil—
lion. through 1993 in an effort to
halt population declines among Af—
rican elephants, whose numbers
reportedly have dropped to
700,000 from 1.5 million in 1979.

The Interior Department would
be required to review elephant
conservation programs of Africa’s
ivory-producing nations and bar

imports of ivory from countries

whose programs are deemed inef-
fective to halt elephant poaching.

Maximum fines for violating the
basic Endangered Species Act also
wrmld be boosted, from $20,000 to
$50,000. The law prohibits trade in
endangered or threatened species
and requires the government to
foster their survival and take no
steps that would hasten their de-
mise.

There currently are nearly 1,000
species on the endangered-threat—
ened list, about 400 of them native
to the United States. Environmen-
talists say about 80 species have
become extinct while awaiting for-
mal protection.

. fﬁcials at Alligator River
. Wildlife Refuge in North

Carolina were passing out ci-
gars when pups were born to
two pairs of red wolves rein-
troduced into the refuge in
1987. These were the ﬁrst off-
spring from a species re-
turned to its natural habitat af-
ter becoming extincr in the
wild.

With their species teetering
on the edge of oblivion, the
last 17 free red wolves were
rounded up in 1978 and trans-
ported to a US. Fish and Wild-
life Service holding area in
Washington State. Captive
breeding seemed their only
chance for survival.

By 1986, their numbers had
risen to 90, and four pairs
were ﬂown to the North Caro-
lina refuge (see “Turning Back

There, the animals were
gradually weaned from their
diet of commercial dog food.

Long thought to be extinct,
a colony of these beleaguered

When the population hits

’ Lab Animals ‘Critical Part?
of Research, Report Holds};

By THOMAS H. MAUGH 11, Times Science Writer

Laboratory animals, including those ob-
tained from pounds and shelters, are a
“critical part" of human health care re-
search and scientists are “morally obliged"
to continue using them, according to a
controversial report released Tuesday by a
committee of the National Academy of
Sciences.

“The chance that alternatives will com-
pletely replace animals [for research] in
the foreseeable future is nil,” the commit-
tee said. But the committee also noted that,
“scientists are ethically obliged to ensure
the well-being of animals used in research
and to minimize their pain and suffering.”

The report takes issue with many animal
welfare groups, which argue that animals
are not necessary for many types of
research and that those that are needed are
frequently abused or simply given inade-
quate care.

The committee was split on several
issues, however, and dissenting statements
from two of the 15 committee members
were included in the report. Physiologist
Arthur C. Guyton of the University of
Mississippi wrote that the report “fails to
make clear how seriously the animal rights
movement and increasing government
regulation are impeding essential medical
research.”

Another committee member, Christine

A

Stevens of the Animal Welfare Institute in
Washington, who refused to sign. the
report, wrote that it “refuses to face.;the
widespread. ingrained problem of unneces—
sary suffering" of laboratory animals. 3;

Animal welfare groups were disappoint-
ed with the report. ; .

“It looks like a description and endorse-
ment of the status quo,” said biologist
Martin Stephens of the Humane Society of
the United States. “I’m surprised it .took
three years to produce this document. It
contains very standard statements-that.
they could have put together in an after-

.noonf’ ,

The committee’s chairman, chemist Nor~
man Hackerman of Rice Uiiiversity,:.eon—
ceded that “this report will not end debate
about the use of animals. . . . We believe.
however, that the report provides a. . .
point of departure forfurther discussion on
how to use animals appropriately.” ’

The number of laboratory animals used
in the United States each year is debatable.
A census of such animals was supposed to
be incorporated in the committee’s deliber-
ations, but contractual difficulties delayed
its completion. .'1

The committee thus relied on previous.
estimates that 17 million to 22 million

Frances Wegman’s

rms.

“I don’t think so,” Wegman says
defensively, pulling the infant clos-
er.
The baby is 5-week-old Shelly,
and truth be told, she’ll have to do a
lot of growing to catch up with
those wings on the side of her head.

Don’t misunderstand. The kid’s a
heart-stealer. A drOp-dead cutie.
But she’s also a monkey, the hon-
est-to-goodness capuchin kind.

Frances and Robert Wegman of
‘ Royal Palm Beach are the mon-
key’s aunt and uncle —— foster par-
ents, if you will. For the next three
years, they’ll be raising this Curi-
ous George lookalike much as they
did their own five offspring.

The idea, Robert says, is to so-
cialize Shelly, “to get her where she
feels comfortable with pe0ple.”

While no more than a chattering,
wide-eyed handful of curiosity
right now, Shelly, nevertheless, has
an important (yes, even responsi-
ble) mission ahead.

She was bred at Discovery Island
at Disney World for; a Boston Uni-
versity program called Helping
Hands: Simian Aides for the Dis-
abled. In three years, Shelly will be

off to Boston, where she’ll lose her ,

; teeth (to prevent biting) and, at a

cost of about $8,000, be trained as a

helpmate for quadriplegics. After
eight months the monkey, 4 to 6

unds by then, will be turning on
lights, fetching magazines, retriev-
ing food from the refrigerator
.(without nibbling on it, mind you)
and, if necessary, feeding her new
companion.

For now, however, Shelly
(named after the Wegman’s 3-year-
old granddaughter Michele) Is as
dependent as any other newborn.
She’s fed every two hours, (with a
doll-sized bottle), bathed, cuddled
almost constantly, and taught some
rather un-simian behavior, like not
biting, and relieving herself only in
her cage.

“That’s her happy sound,” says-
Robert, folding his tatooed arms (in
the table, mesriiiei; ized by the fuzzy
little critter that is trilling,'wh1s-
tling and putting its head in his
wife’s hand. “She also has an m-
quisitive sound and a nervous
sound.”

And a cry. Which she let loose
only once, says Frances, “When I
took her in the shower.”

The couple are well acquainted
with the Species’ range of sounds,
as well as its facial expressrons.
This is the second HelpingHand
monkey that has hung out wrth the
Wegmans. Their first was Charlie,
who moved with them from East-
hampton, Mass, in January of ’87.

“We left in a snowstorm,” recalls

3 Robert. “In the back seat of

the car, we had our daughter, the
Doberman, three parakeets, and
Charlie.”

“We were a traveling pet shop,”
Frances says, laughing.

Charlie came to the couple from
a laboratory. “When we picked him
up, he was on the wild side,” says
.Robert, a retired naval officer who
now works at PGA National as a se-
curity guard.

The couple tamed Charlie mea-
surably, but gave him up after two
years because of an entrenched
hostility. “He loved my wife and
daughter, but he was afraid of men
in glasses,” says Robert, pushing
his glasses up off his nose.

Shelly is a different personality
altogether, calm and sweet-na-
tured.

“They’re like peOple,” Frances
says. “They’re all different.”

Make no mistake, however, Shel-
ly in her infancy is a handful. She
clings to Frances every waking
moment of the day. Even when
Frances goes shOpping, Shelly tags
along, tucked in a bag, her little
black-topped head sticking out,
swiveling like a wind-spun weath-
ervane.

“She generally takes a nap from
12 to 2,” Frances says. “That gives
'us time to do the birds or something
else around the house.”

The birds, incidentally, number
about 25. On the 11/4-acre home-
stead are ducks, geese, parrots,
parakeets, finches, cockatoos,
cockatiels, and of course, two dogs.

“We love animals,” understates

Robert.

Shelly also, thankfully, sleeps
through the night, bedding down in
her cage about midnight, and wak-
ing six or seven hours later. Nap
and bedtime are the only times
she’s ever inactive, and in her cage.

Because of the inordinate a-
mount of attention that has to be
lavished on the infant monkeys, one
of the requirements of the foster
program is that the prime care-

' giver be at home all day.

The Wegmans are not paid for
their loving efforts. “After Shelly’s
weaned, the program will provide
her monkey chow. And her doctor

bins-are paid,” Robert says.

But the baby formula (Shelly
slurps about 6 ounces 3 day), the di-
apers, the scales to weigh her, the
Handiwipes, toys, treats, and the
leash that eventually will be part of
her everyday apparel -— all are
paid for out of the Wegmans’ own

pockets.

“We don’t think about it many-
eywise,” says Frances, whose
thumb and forefinger are being
gripped by Shelly as the monkey
tries to get comfortable on a
stuffed animal on Frances’ lap. She
cocks her head, sticks a thumb in
her mouth and begins sucking. Rob-
ert immediately begins to warm up
a bottle.

About 71 young capuchins are in
foster care across the country.
Nine others already are assisting
quadriplegics in their homes.

“We’re pretty strict,” says Dave
Taylor, director of foster home
placement in Byfield, Mass. “We’ve
screened probably 4,000 letters
[from prospective foster parents] in
the past two years.” Out of that
number, 200 families have been ap-
proved as surrogates.

The Wegmans readily admit
they’ve had no training in simian
parenting. What they and all the
others get instead is a kind of pre-
hensile telling of Dr. Spock, a man-
ual listing dos and don’ts (don’t, for
instance, let the monkeys get ac-
customed to sitting on your shoul-

‘der or head), and giving tips on dia-

pering and toilet training.

Having raised five children, the
Wegmans feel fairly comfortable
dealing with Shelly. As for the en-
gaging infant with the wizened
face, she seems totally unmindful
that her surrogate mom is not of
her kind.

The Wegmans anticipate sad
times ahead when Shelly has to
move on. The saving grace, says
Robert, is “you know it’s all for a
good cause. A quadriplegic needs
24-hour care. A capuchin monkey
can take away 20 hours of that
caref’ ‘

Besides, the couple have high
h0pes the Boston University-edu-
cated Shelly will be placed back in
the local community. “That way,”
says Robert, “we’ll be able to visit
her.”

Asked if a robot perhaps couldn’t
be built to function as well for
quadriplegics, Robert looks as-
tounded. “That would be awful,” he
says. “You couldn’t talk to a robot.”

Of Mice as Stand-Ins for Men

Breakthrough research gives the animals human immune systems

 

F or years. laboratory mice have served
well as substitutes for humans in study-
ing diseases or testing new drugs or vac-
cines. But in many areas, mice have not al-
ways proved up to the job of acting as
surrogate humans—in studies ofthedaunt-
ingly complex and speciﬁc human iin’r’nune
system, for example, and in research into
how the deadly AIDS virus works to cripple

the body‘s defenses. Last week, however.’

mice and men suddenly seemed more alike
than different. at least in some critical as-
pects of biology.
In a pair of remarkable
studies. one reported in the
journal Nature and the other
to be pubiished in Science
this week. researchers at the
Medical Biology Institute in
La Jolla. Calif. and at Stan-
ford University, working
separately and using differ—
ent methods. successfully
transplanted elements of the
human immune system into
mice. The achievement
meant that such animals
may soon serve as stand-ins
for human beings in the
study of AIDS and a host of
other diseases. including leu-
kemia and hepatitis. The
mice could also be used to
test drugs that would be un—
safe to test in humans and to
study the mysteries of the
immune system with a pre- ,
cision never before possible. 5 '

who is head of the La Jolla
institute: “This potentially
rivals gene-splicing technologies in its im-
pact. It has redeﬁned what bioengineer—
ing can be about."

The Stanford scientists announced
their ﬁndings. which involved transplant-
ing human fetal tissue into the mice. just
as a special advisory committee of the
National Institutes of Health was meeting
in Bethesda. Md. to consider the scientif-
ic and ethical issues surrounding the use
of human fetal tissue in experimental re-
search. The reason: to develop recom-
mendations that may inﬂuence the Rea-
gan Administration‘s proposed ban on
such federally funded research.

The work with fetal tissue was by far
the more elaborate of the two research ef-
forts. Led by Stanford‘s Dr. Mike McCune
and Irving Weissman. the scientiﬁc team
actually reconstituted a human immune
system in mice that lacked their own im-
mune systems. Because of a genetic ab—
normality known as SCID (for severe com-
bined immunodeﬁciency). these mice

 

usually die at an early age. often of pneu-
mocystis pneumonia. the disease that kills
many AIDS patients. The researchers im-
planted some 300 of the defective mice
with tissue taken from human fetal thy—
mus. where certain immune and blood
cells develop. and with blood—forming
cells from fetal liver. The implanted tis-
sues soon. produced mature human T
cells. specialized white blood cells that
help provide immunity against disease.
Mice that additionally received fetal

 

weeks they had human immune systems
with nearly correct proportions of all the
major types of white cells found in human
blood. Moreover. when the researchers in-
jected these mice with tetanus toxoid. most
of the animals produced human antietanus
antibodies. further proof that their new im—
mune systems were functioning as though
they were naturally human.

Because SCID mice lack immune sys-
tems, the scientists did not expect them to
reject the transplanted human cells. Re-
searchers also suspected that the human
fetal cells. since they are too immature to
distinguish themselves from foreign cells.
would not reject the mice in a graft-vs.-
host response. But. surprisingly. the adult
human cells used in the La Jolla research
did not reject the mice ei-
ther. “That these human
cells recirculate around in
the mice without caring is
astounding.” said Dr. Don—
ald Mosier. head of the La
Jolla research team.

There was yet another
unexpected consequence of

Of some immune cells—also developed
mature human B cells. All fetal tissues
were obtained from legally aborted fetus-
es with the consent of the mothers.

After more than a year. the Stanford
mice are still thriving. Their new immune
systems. however. must be sustained by
injections of fetal liver cells every eight to
twelve weeks. In addition. researchers are
not sure whether all the parts of the hu-
man system are functioning in the mice.
“We‘ll ﬁnd that out,“ says Weissman.
“but we‘ll have to do every known test for
human immune cells. These mice open
ways of studying human systems, normal
or diseased. under experimental circum-
stances that were impossible before.“

The La J olla team also used SCID mice.
By comparison. however. their approach
was simple. Circulating white blood cells
taken from human adults were injected
into mice. Almost immediately. the mice
began replicating the cells. Within three

the experiment. After being
injected with human immune
cells. many of the mice sud-
denly developed rapidly
growing cancers, perhaps
caused by a virus in the blood
of some of the donors; mice in—
jected with cells not exposed
to this virus did not develop
the tumors. The implications
for cancer research could be
enormous: the rapid growth
———in eight to 16 weeks——
would afford scientists a rare
opportunity to track the
emergence and spread of can-
cer. Said Mosier: "This is an
extraordinary breakthrough.
We may be able to dissect that
tissue week by week to see
what happens to these cells.”

Mosier’s research bore some rele-
vance to the discussions under way at the
NIH meeting. While the Stanford work
with fetal tissue appeared to be a power-
ful argument for continuing such experi—
mentation. the La Jolla studies seemed.
however unintentionally, to offer an al—
ternative. Still. Daniel Koshland J r.. edi-
tor of Science, who admitted to releasing
the Stanford results a week early in order
to coincide with the NIH meeting. strong-.
1y backed the scientists” right to continue
their research. Said Koshland: “This is an
excellent example of careful. scientiﬁcal-
ly controlled use of fetal tissue to attack
major human disease." Moreover. the
fetal-tissue transplants give the mice a
more complete human immune system.
which should provide a better model for
studying the progression of AIDS and
other diseases. —-By John Langone.

FT. LAUDERDALE NEWS/SUN—SENTINEL - September 25, 1988

Older dogs, older people

matched a in

 

By JOSEPH SCHWERDT
Staff Writer

I“ Adeline Lambert gets misty eyes
when she thinks about her late pet
Mickey.

The feisty but lovable pug died
last year, leaving Adeline and Bill
Lambert without a pet for the first
time in more than a dozen years.

' “I’ll never get over him,” Ade-
line said.

The Lamberts of West Palm‘

Beach turned to the Animal Rescue
League and its Pets for People pro-
gram.

The program matches old dogs,
who may not otherwise be adopted,
with people aged 60 or more who
are looking for companionship.

The Lamberts found the perfect
match. Nugget is a homely, over-
weight, arthritic pug whom the
Lamberts love. She was the first
dog adopted from the program, in
June last year.

“The minute I saw her, I knew
she was my dog,” said Adeline
Lambert, 77.

The benefits that pets offer to the
mental health and physical well-
being of their owners have been do-
cumented in dozens of studies.

Among the most recent, a study
by the National Institutes of Health
in Bethesda, Md., shows that pets

affect heart rate and blood pres- ,

sure and provide emotional and so-
cial stimulation for those who use
wheelchairs. And a study by Ral-
ston Purina, national Sponsors of
the program, shows that 90 percent
of the seniors polled say they are
less lonely and much happier since
adopting an animal.

Since the Lamberts adopted
Nugget, more than 150 dogs and
cats have been adapted through the
program. Purina pays the shelter
up to $100 for adoption fees and ini-
tial veterinary expenses and 1i-
censes. Pet owners receive a leash,
collar, bowl and some food.

There are 103 programs spon-
sored by the company in 90 cities

around the country. Nine are in

Florida.

Purina limits the number of
adoptions to 10 per month, and the
Animal Rescue League has had no
problem filling the quota.

The dogs can be any age or
breed, but most seniors like small,
older dogs.

“A lot of older animals won’t be
adopted to families with children,”
said Sherry McKay, coordinator of
the program and Animal Rescue
League.

Those interested in adopting a
pet can call the Animal Rescue
League at 686-3663.

in most cases, kills them.

It does so humanely. medical
center officials say, just as it
treats animals humanely before
procedures and, if they survive,
afterward.

But the practice is controver—
sial. Representatives of eight Dal-
las area animal welfare groups
have banded together for the
first time to stop the use of
pound animals in research. In
doing so they join a growing na-
tionwide force of animal lovers
who, sometimes militantly. are
exerting pressure on local, state
and federal governments to limit
the use of live animal experi-
ments in medical and commer-
cial products laboratories.

Researchers say that, national-
ly, about 200,000 pound animals
are used each year, about the
number put to death by animal
shelters in one week. The medi-
cal community defends the prac—
tice, saying many advancements
would not have been made with—
out the use of animals as re-
search tools. Physicians point to
the fact that many vaccines ——
including polio vaccines -— were
developed through animal re—
search. .

Animal rights groups, howev-
er, are suspicious of many labora-
tory procedures and particularly
concerned about the use of cast—
away pets or strays. “There is no
reason why these animals should
not be offered for adoption in-
stead of being sold for research,”
said Virginia Prejean of Dallas,
who for years has fought what
she calls “pound seizures.”

Most of the area’s research fa-
cilities shop at the city pounds
for dogs and cats. Annually,
about 40,000 animals are collect-
ed by Dallas animal control offi-
cers. The number far exceeds the
demand for adopted pets, which
leaves pound officials with two
choices: Kill the animals at the
shelter or sell them to govern-
ment-approved labs.

This year, the city will sell
more than 1,000 dogs and cats to
researchers. The major consumer
locally is Southwestern, which
uses the pound animals for re-
search into heart and blood dis
eases and organ transplants,
among other things. Many also
Lre operated on by students in
physiology labs. The ‘city also
sells a few dozen impounded ani-
mals to Baylor University Medi-
cal Center and Baylor University
Dental School. .

“What we’re saying is that in-
stead of killing all those animals,
let us have some for medical re-
search," said Dr. Steven Pakes,
director of the animal resources
department at Southwestern.

I think it’s sad so-
called animal rights
groups don’t . . . ed-
ucate themselves.’

Lynn Gibson,
Baylor University
Medical Center

 

sity Medical Center. -

Pakes of Southwestern ques—
tions the groups’ claims that all
they want to do is limit the use
of animals and ensure humane
treatment. “Their stated intent is
to stop the use of all animals in
research,” he said.

What goes on in the animal
labs and on the operating tables
might not be a pretty sight ——
although surgical conditions are
the same as they would ”be for
humans — but it is all done ac-
cording to strict rules, Pakes said.

The center, like all legal medi-
cal research facilities, must fol-
low the Animal Welfare Act of
1985, which sets standards for
the treatment of animals, right
down to a formula for determin-
ing minimum sizes for dog pens.
If Southwestern breached the
rules and was caught by federal
inspectors, it could lose millions
of dollars in animal research
funds, he said.

In addition, Pakes said, any
aroject involving an animal must

Review Board for Animal Re-
search, whose ‘11 members are
appointed by the medical center
president. If the. end result of a
project is to be the death of the
animal, the board must give prior
approval. '

“We do not treat any of our
animals inhumanely,” Pakes
said. “We are very careful about
that.”

Prejean and Peggy Ryan-
Smith, also a member of the Ani-
mal Connection of Texas, said
they know of no specific instanc—
es of cruel treatment of animals
at Southwestern. But abuses
have been documented else—
where, they say. Ryan-Smith, for
instance, said she knows a wom-
an whose lost dog was rescued
from a research lab moments be-
fore an experiment.

“The dog was all right,” Ryan-

‘Srnitli? said, “except they had

clipped his vocal chords to keep
him quiet.”

Brenda Echols of Irving said
that in the 2 17% years she worked
as a lab techniCian at Southwest‘
em in the early 19805 she wit-
nessed several “atrocities.”

“They would knock down
(anesthetize) 25 to 30 dogs at a

time and send them down for the ‘

students to practice surgery on,”
she said. Another time, she said,
she saw dozens of mice used in a
cancer experiment die lingering
and painful deaths even after the
experiment was completed.
Pakes said he is not familiar
with the mice experiment but
pointed out that it is not depart-
ment procedure to allow animals
to suffer needlessly. The dogs, he

said, probably were to be studied
in physiology classes and would
have been destroyed afterward.
“We don’t do practice surgery,”
he added.

It is not so much the type of
research conducted —— but the
type of animals used —-— that is of '
major concern to the Dallas ani-
mal groups.

Instead of using pound dogs,
researchers should buy dogs bred
specifically for research, they 5
said. Quality research is conduct-
ed in Holland, Denmark and
Sweden all countries that
have outlawed the use of pound
animals by labs, they said, add—
ing that some US. regions have
also outlawed the practice.

The so-called “purpose-bred”
dogs have never been pets, and
because most of them are pure-
bred they would provide more
precise data than pound dogs,“
the local groups argue. ,

Pakes disagrees. Pound dogs f
are‘ better research subjects, be-
cause they are more like humans
in that they are not in-bred.
There also is a ﬁnancial concern:
Purpose-bred dogs are too expen-
sive, costing anywhere from
about $450, for a beagle, to $800
or more, for large dogs. ,

The animal welfare coalition
has not set a date to take its case 1
to the City Council, but its pro—
posal appears certain to stir emo-
tions. Researchers will probably ,
point out the scientific advances ,
resulting from animal experi-
ments; opponents will argue that ,
research can be cruel and unjust. ,

As Prejean puts it, “Animals:

 

have rights, too, you know.”

By zu VINCENT

Top, a giant Great Dane
owned by actor Alex Patz- .
waldt, was a big hit with
neighbors’ children in the f
Hollywood apartment com- 6-

plex where his owner lived. .7
Top had a clownish face, but
a heart filled with courage --

and in less than nine
weeks, he saved the lives
of not one but two chil-
dren.

On an April day in 1969,
an 11-year-old girl asked
Alex if she could take Top
for a walk. Alex agreed, and
the girl began walking Top
down the street on a leash.

They reached the first cor-
ner. Top’s companion step-
ped off the curb. Suddenly
the Great Dane heard a high-
pitched roar coming toward
them. Almost in the same in-
stant he caught a glimpse of
chrome-plated grillwork and
speeding wheels.

It was too late for the
delivery truck to stop. Top

threw himself in front of the .
child, pushing her backward j.

pher Conley was lying on the
bottom of the pool, appar-
ently lifeless, under six feet
of water.

Great Danes are notorious
water-haters, but Top didn’t
hesitate. He leaped into the
pool, bad leg and all, kicking
downward to the boy.

Frantically, the dog grab-

from the pressure, as he sur-
faced and paddled deSper-
ately toward the side of the
pool.
Heaving himself up out of
the pool, Top struggled as
his big paws slid on the
soaked cement beneath him,
his weak back leg buckling.

Then he scrambled toward
the back door of Alex’s
apartment.

Top howled and howled. It
was only moments before his
haying brought Alex out.

Adventurer uses her magazine to try to rectify wolf' s beastly

”Wol‘ woman Deborah Warrick with one of her qharges.

By Lisa Wolfson
ASSOCIATED PRESS

LOS ANGELES ~—— Her friends
call her “the wolf woman.” She’s
an animal rights activist with a
taste for adventure and a yen to be
a centerfold.

Deborah Warrick, who now pub-
fishes her own magazine devoted
to her favorite canines, cringes ev-
ery time she hears nursery rhymes
like “The Three Little Pigs,” “Little
Red Riding Hood” and “Peter and
the Wolf.”

Such tales, she says, wrongly
portray wolves as ravenous beasts
that prey on little children, as in a
passage from the famous Grimm
Brothers fairy tale:

“When she got to the wood, she
met a wolf; but Red Riding Hood
did not know what a wicked ani-
mal he was. . .

“The wolf thought: ‘This tender
little creature will be a plump mor-
sel.’ ”

“Kids are raised fearing wolves
and they grow up not caring if they
are killed,” says Warric who

 

 

~owns three wolves and this year

began publishing a magazine
called “Wolves and Related Can—
ids ”

Not all popular wolf stories put
the animal in a bad light, Warrick
says, citing the Disney films Never
Cry Wolf and The Adventures of
Natty Gann.

But the animals have traditional-
ly had a bad reputation. They were
virtually wiped out in the early part
of this century in the United States
and only now are being reintro-
duced into the wild.

However, Warrick describes
them as basically timicir," opportu-

nistic animals that go for the easi-
est kill.

“I’d be more afraid of a pit bull L’-

or a German shepherd,” she says.

Warrick, 33, became interested
in wild animals at an early age.

“I’ve always been into exotics,”
she says. “My parents always en-
couraged that sort of thing and we
had pet rattlesnakes and raccoons
-—— even an 8-foot python.”

She is no stranger to adventure.
Besides nursing exotic reptiles and
other wildlife back to health, she
started an advertising agency, was
an investment counselor, per-
formed in professional roller-skat-
ing shows and was a sky diver until
a near-fatal accident.

She also was chosen recently as
one of 100 contestants in Playboy
magazine’s 35th anniversary Play—
mate search.

Warrick hopes to win the
$35,000 in prize money, which she
says will go toward her efforts in
behalf of wolves.

Seven years ago, Warrick, who
lives in the San Fernando Valley
and now sells 3 D computer graph-
ic systems to the aerospace indus-
try, was given her first wolf cub.

“That’ s when I realized just how
intelligent they are," she says, not-
ing that a wolf’s brain is 30 percent
larger than that of a similar—sized
dog.

She got around a California law
that grohibits people from keeping
pure red wolves as pets by regis—
tering them as dogs. But wolves,
she says, are not for everyone.

, In fact, Warrick uses the maga—
zine to discourage people from at-
tempting to raise wolves at home.
Too often, they get into the wrong
hands and either end up put to

Sea Otter Resettlement Enters New Plies

By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer

VENTURA—Despite a dismal
first year trying to establish a new
sea otter colony on one of the
Channel Islands, the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service on Tuesday began
the second phase of its controver-
sial plan to relocate 250 of the furry
animals from the central coast by
1992.

Using fishing nets and scuba
gear, biologists set out again to
capture as many as 70 of the 1,700
otters living from Pismo Beach to
Santa Cruz and airlift them'to San
Nicolas Island, an isolated speck
southwest of Los Angeles.

Although commercial fishermen
have complained that the reIOCa-
tion will decimate the area’s shell—
fish, which the otters feed on,
federal officials say the $1-million-
a- year program is necessary to
protect the otters, whose existing
coastal colony could be wiped out
by an oil spill or disease.

The otters, however, have yet to
ﬂourish at their new home 70 miles
offshore. Of the 69 animals brought
last year to San Nicolas, only 14
remain. Ten have died. Thirteen
swam back to the mainland. One
errant otter was returned to the
mainland by the wildlife service.
And 31 are missing and unaccount-
ed for.

The deaths, which have raised
doubts even among biologists in-
volved in the relocation, have been
the result of stress related to

capture, drowning in fishing gear
and a gunshot wound to one otter,
which was found wrapped in chains
last fall near Point Mugu.

“I felt and still feel it’s the right
thing to do," said Jim Estes, a US.
Fish and Wildlife research biologist
in Santa Cruz. “But the question of
Whether or not this thing is going
to be successful still has not been
answered.”

To brand the program a failure,
however, would be a mistake, Estes
said, adding that such relocations
are always tricky operations and
that it can take years to establish a
thriving new community.

In Washington state, for in-
stance, biologists relocated 59
otters between 1969 and 1970, only
to find that just 19 remained in
1977. The downward trend did not
halt until the early 19805 when the
otter population grew to 36, and
could not be deemed a success until
1987 when the number hit 94.

But the program’s critics, includ-
ing the fish and game commissions
of Santa Barbara and Ventura
counties, say the first-year results
are indicative.

“If they keep this up, the Califor-
nia sea otter truly will become an
endangered species,” said Jim Don-
lan, chairman of the Ventura Coun—
ty commission, which has jurisdic-
tion over the island. “It’s a
disaster.”

California “ash and Game cc;
sion has given the program its
blessing, as has the California
Coastal Commission and various
environmental groups.

The California sea otter, which
once numbered nearly 20.000, was
forced to the brink of extinction in
the 19th Century by hunters. By
1911, when sea otter hunting final- ,
1y was banned, fewer than 100 of
the animals remained.

Slowly, though, at a rate of about
5% a year, the herd made a
remarkable recovery, reaching its
present count of about 1,700 in
1976. However, the growth sud-
denly stopped, and it was not long
before federal officials listed the
otter, known to scientists as Enhy-
dra lutm‘s nereis, as a threatened
population under the Endangered
Species Act.

Although at least 100,000 now
live in the Aleutian Islands of
Alaska, biologists still consider the
California herd in jeopardy because
of the tankers hauling more than T
100 million barrels of oil each year ’
along the state’s coast. 5

As a kind of insurance policy
against a devastating calamity, the
wildlife service proposed establish-
ing a second colony at Navy,
owned San Nicolas, which wast
once home to the animals and
boasts a hearty supply of otter
food—abalone, sea urchins and
spiny lobsters.

“It means television cam-

“En route to their new
homes, the penguins are free
to wander around inside the
cargo area and do any of the
things they usually do.

“They actually travel quite
well.”

Accompanying the chicks: a
contingent of Sea World avi-
an experts, some of whom will
stay for a while at each of the
three parks to assist with the
transfer and help the staff.

“These are the chicks that I

would not have survived in
the wild,” said Twohy. “Pen-
guins lay only one egg a year.
But, because of the time it
takes in the wild for a penguin
to raise a chick, it’s 15
months or longer before
they’re ready to rear another
youngster.

“In the meantime, they lay
another egg. That second
chick hatches while the par-
ents are still raising the ﬁrst

 

chick, so the second chick
never gets large enough to
survive.

“It dies. By the time the
third chick hatches, the par-
ents are ready to raise another
chick. This means that the
penguins can raise only two
chicks every three years. Ev-
ery other chick dies.”

The Sea World chicks,
Twohy explained, are the
ones that would have died.

“We gathered up the eggs
and brought them back here
to hatch. It’s a really good

' feeling to know this program

otherwise would have
perished.”

Since 1983, Sea World has
raised more than 1,000 pen-
guin chicks collected as eggs
from the South Pole and oth-
er regions south of the
equator.

It’s part of the penguin
propagation and research pro-
gram initiated in 1972, when
Sea World was approached by
the National Science Founda-
tion to establish a research
penguin colony in the United
States. Today the San Diego
park has the largest collection
of king penguins outside the
Antarctic.

In the wild, penguin chicks
are fed by their parents regur-

the chicks are fed a pureed

‘Gorillas’

 

premiere raises

$50,000 for primate projects

j By Joanne Davidson
Denver Post Society Editor

Denver’s community of ani-
mal lovers and actress Sigour-
ney Weaver turned out Thurs-
day to raise 0,000 for the
Denver Zoo’s new primate cen-
ter and for research that may
help to ensure‘the survival of
Africa’s mountain gorillas.

Denver rolled out its red car-
pet for Weaver, who came to
town for the Rocky Mountain
premiere of “Gorillas in the
Mist,” the emotional film tale of
anthropologist Dian Fossey.

A Universal Pictures/ Warner
'Bros. release, “Gorillas in the
Mist” opens today after benefit
premieres in Los Angeles, New
York and Denver.

Ruth Keesling, ’a Littleton
resident who is a trustee of the
Denver Zoo and the president of
the Digit Fund, which furthers
Fossey’s work, helped coordi-
nate the three cities’ opening
festivities.

Weaver, whose classic beauty
was showcased in a strikingly
simple black dress accented on-
ly by a pair of dangling green
gemstone earrings, dined with
260 animal lovers at Cherry
Hills Country Club at 7 pm. and
then joined a sell-out crowd at
the Cooper heater for the
film’s 9 pm. screening.

Proceeds to be shared

Proceeds from the Denver
event will be divided between
the Digit Fund, a non-profit or-
ganization, and the Denver
Zoo’s new primate center.

Fossey, an anthropologist,
dedicated 19 years of her life to
studying the physiology and so-

cial behavior of the endangered
mountain gorillas in the Virunga
Mountains of Rwanda, a lush
but primitive area in central Af-
rica. She was murdered shortly
after Christmas in 1985.

Those who know Weaver,
whose previous credits include
“Alien” and “Ghostbusters,”
say that the role of Dian Fossey
had a profound impact on her.

In a brief interview, Weaver
agreed.

Hopes to return

“Dian Fossey had a very pro-
found love for animals, gorillas
in particular, and that love is
bound to rub off on anyone who
had anything to do with her. I
hope to return to Rwanda some-
time in the next couple of
years.”

Keesling expanded on Weav-
er’s remarks.

“She feels she has been trans-
formed. She made herself into
Dian Fossey; she entered the
gorilla’s world with a sense of
compassion and emerged as a
concerned advocate for their
survival.”

During filming, Weaver was a
real trouper, Keesling said.

“She climbed those 10,000-foot
mountains of Rwanda with little
help and fewer amenities. They
were on location for three
months, and it was cold and
rainy. The director said she was
indefatigable.”

Weaver, though, said she re-
ally didn’t mind.

“It was kind of like being

here,” she said.»“You get used
to it.”

INT. HERALD TRIBUNE - September 29, 1988

Tracking Down the Seal-Killing Virus

By Joe Kirwrn
Specra/ to the Herald Tribune

TOCKHOLM -— Four months ago Anders
ergmann, a Swedish pathologist and one
of the world’s foremost seal experts, was per-
forming autopsies on carcasses of some of the
more than 15,000 seals that have died in the
North Sea from what was then a mysterious
virus. He noticed the characteristics of an
agent, encountered in previous veterinary work,

that attacks the immune system.

Mr. Bergmann found that the animals’
lymph glands were devoid of lymphocyaes and
that their spleens were damaged. This reminded
him of autopsies he had done on animals that
had died of a canine distemper virus that all
domestic dogs are vaccinated against. 1

Early in the summer, Mr. Bergmann; of the
University of Agriculture in Uppsala, Sweden,
passed on those observations to virologists in
Sweden and the Netherlands who were trying
to isolate the lethal virus killing the seals.

Four months after his suggestions, and after
three and a half months investigating a herpes
and picurna virus. Dr. Albert Osterhaus in the
Netherlands and Dr. Bernt Klingeborn in Swe-
den, who cooperated in the research, an-
nounced the culprit: a canine distemper virus.

“If we had thought about what Anders Berg-
mann had told us -— that the pathological
picture looks like canine distemper,” said Dr.
Klingeborn, who works at the National Veteri-
narian Institute in Uppsala. “We would cer-
tainly have found it a lot earlier.”

The reasons Dr. Osterhaus and Dr. Klinge-
born and their colleagues failed to find canine
distemper virus earlier exemplify the complex-
ities of virology research. In this case, the job
was further complicated because little of this
type work had been done with seals.

As with any viral isolation work. the re-
searchers followed the postulates developed by
Dr. Robert Koch, the German Nobel laureate
and pioneer of virus work. These involve isola-

tion, certification of widespread virus presence
and, as final proof, reintroduction.

Dr. Osterhaus, at the Netherlands National
Institute for Public Health and Environment,
had developed a herpes vaccine several years
ago and his immediate tests with dead seal
serum and organ tissue were positive for both a
herpes and a picurna virus. But the herpes virus
was ruled out because seals given the vaccine
were not protected. and researchers focused on
the picurna virus.

To verify a picurna virus as the infecting
agent, Dr. Osterhaus tested gray seals, a species
closely related to the harbor seal also suffering
from symptoms of the virus, for picurna anti-
bodies. The picurna virus theory became sus-
pect when the gray seals tested negative. It was
abandoned when the Dutch virologist devel-
oped a picurna virus that, like the herpes vac-
cine, provided no protection .

At that stage. in early August, the researchers
started to look for a canine distemper virus.
“The reason we didn’t find the canine distem-
per virus earlier is that you have to look for it to
find it,” said Dr. Osterhaus. '

The search for canine distemper antibodies
involved two steps. First, the Elisa technique,
also a test for measles, was applied; then a
neutralization test, designed to indicate the
highly specific antibody structure triggered by
canine distemper. When that diagnostic work
with blood proved positive, Dr. Osterhaus told
Dr. Klingeborn and both began trying to isolate
it in cell structures. -

To do that, a special irnmunofluorescence
microscope was required. “The canine distem-
per virus is too small so you can’t see it under a
normal microscope but you can trace the anti-
gen of the virus substructures, which are being
produced in cells,” Dr. Osterhaus said. “You
can trace them by using antibodies which you
have coupled to a fluorescent label.”

Within several days both virologists had iso-
lated the canine distemper virus. Corroboration

came from researchers in Britain, Denmark and
Germany. Those confirmations fulfilled the
second of Koch’s postulates, widespread proof
of the presence of the virus. The third Koch
postulate, reintroduction of the virus as final
verification, is yet to be completed.

“This is a very emotional question and that is
a problem,” said Dr. Osterhaus. “There is a
possibility that we could use dogs for that third
step. But I don’t think it is needed to prove this
is the cause of the deaths.

“But we are trying to develop a vaccine right
now and to show protection with that vaccine
we might have to do some challenge [reintro-
duction] experiments. But we are doing them
under controlled conditions so the animals
won’t die. The purpose of that experiment,
though, is not to reinfect but to prove protea-
tion from a vaccine.”

Most scientists agree that applications of a
vaccine are limited, as it would be impossible to
vaccinate animals in the wild. There was hope
of trying to use a vaccine in England and
Ireland, where seals are dying in large numbers.
But at a meeting last week in Amsterdam.
biologists agreed that it would be disruptive for
females giving birth. .

How the canine distemper virus reached the
seals is another major question. “We. know that
mink-like animals along the coast of Denmark
have had this virus and they may have been in
contact with the seals,” Dr. Osterhaus said.

‘ “We know the virus can change when it is
passed from one animal to another so by show-
ing certain markers on the virus we can hope-
fully trace it back,” Dr. Klingeborn said.

Work is also under way to determine if pollu—
tion in the North Sea had any secondary effect.
“This is definitely an infectious disease,” said
Dr. Osterhaus. “But pollution could have
played a role because it could have lowered the
seals’ immunity. The seals won’t be wiped out
because they will build up immunity. but I can’t
say the same thing about the toxins we are
dumping into the water.” ' '

 

THE, HOUSTON POST - 9/26/88

Anima

s and AIDS

Two recent advances in the war against AIDS provide encourage—

ment that chinks continue to be found in the armor of this deadly,
formidable disease. American researchers have altered a poison so
that it kills not the AIDS virus per se, but the host blood cells that
harbor and manufacture it. In Italy, scientists have produced and
stabilized AIDS infections in laboratory rabbits.

Bully for both teams — and has anybody suggested that one
group’s efforts may vastly increase the potential of the other’s?

The poison research has so far only been carried out in test-tube
envrronments. Given the deadly outcome of AIDS and the potential-
ly devastating side-effects of the new substance, testing it in humans
appears to be a last resort. Trying it on rabbits would thus seem a
logical next step. (Previously, chimpanzees had to be used; this
posed problems because of their rarity and expense, to say nothing
of their being uncomfortably close to humans biologically.)

All this points to the fact that research using animals still has a
place in pushing back the boundaries of knowledge. While animal-
rrghts advocates correctly decry practices such as using them to test
cosmetics, as well as laboratory procedures that amount to pointless
cruelty, there remain tests in which there is no substitute for live
subjects. Sadly, until such need is eliminated, better them than us.

By ANNE DRISCOLL

Special to the New York Times

ROCKPORT, Mass. —— To many peo-
ple who live in this small seacoast com-
munity, seagulls are a dirty, noisy nui-
sance, but to members of the GULL fan
club, one bird rises above the rest.

The co-founders of GULL, Karen
Carbone and David Alpher, began the
club in January, several years after a
yellow-eyed, gray-mantled herring gull
gthey named Lyle S. Buck befriended
them. They said the organization grew
:from friends’ and neighbors’ interest in
’Lyle’s comings and goings.

For $4 in annual dues, the club’s 96
members receive a monthly newsletter
iabout Lyle, including updates on the
courtship of his gull friend, Joanie
Maroni, and some of Lyle’s favorite
recipes, like chilled French toast.

Who would pay for this information?
Vls. Carbone said that members in-

~lude physicians, psychiatrists, a phi-
osopher, a film maker, and nurses and
eachers, among others. Outside the
ma, there are members in California

over. We had some matzoh that we
were getting pretty tired of so we de-

feed the poor gulls. Of the hundreds
that showed up, only one had the
smarts to figure out it could happen
again, and he’s come every day since
with rare exception.”

Every morning between 5 and 6, Lyle
lands on a perch outside the kitchen
window of the couple’s third-floor
studio apartment. He bangs at the win-
dow until his friends are roused and
ready to feed him breakfast, usually
dog-food chicken, leftover fish, sar-
dines or buttered bread.

On a typical day, Lyle will show for
his feedings twice, often in the ’com-
pany of Joani Maroni, who will watch
him eat and nuzzle him occassionally-
but will not attempt to claim any of his
food. His feeders said they don’t think
Lyle is necessarily being piggish, but
may share the food with Joani when
they’re alone.

Lyle’s relationship with his feeders is
deeper than just fish and scraps, they
maintain.

‘Not J ust a Food Thing’

 

“This is not just a food thing,” Ms.
Carbone said. “There’s a relationship

“He once brought us a baby clam

picked it up and brought it back to me
again,” she said. “It was a present.
That’s when I knew we had a relation-
ship, when he actually brought me
some food. I thought, this is specral."

Lyle recognizes his name. Ms. Car-
bone said she can discern his screech.
He often accompanies her on walks
near the apartment.

Ms. Carbone and Mr. Alpher gave up '

their vegetarian diet because Lyle en-

“There‘s some consideration
about relocating the bats to a
roosting box somewhere in the
area.” said Tom Lavoie. regional
planner for the department. "The
bats aren’t rare or endangered.
but what is rare is to have a colo-
ny of this size so close to Boston."

For 10 years. scientists in Bos-
ton University's biology depart-
ment have been studying the bats.
They are a common New England
variety. though many equate
them with their more bloodthirsty
cousin, the vampire bat. Vampire
bats are found only in Central and
South America. yet geography has
done little to change common mis-

‘ understandings about bats in gen-
eral.

; Separate facts from myth

' Part of BU's mission, said
Thomas Kunz, the department‘s
resident bat specialist, is to sepa—
rate facts from myths about these
mammals. Giving the public a
closer look at the bats is also being
considered. Kunz has suggested
installation of a one—way glass at
the shop so the bats could be ob-
served undisturbed when the re—
storation is completed.

“People fear them out of igno-
rance," said Kunz. who has stud-
ied the behavioral and physiologi—
cal ecology of bats for 25 years.
“They’ve been exposed over the
years to all kinds of wives” tales
and folklore about bats.

“When bats migrate from sum-
mer to winter colonies. sometimes
they get lost and end up in peo-
ple’s attics or bedrooms. People get
frightened because they've heard
all sorts of silly things about
bats."

For so many years, the myths
and facts about bats have been
hopelessly intertwined. Yes. bats
sleep hanging upside down and
emit a high-pitched sound that en—
ables them to fly in virtual dark-
ness. No, they do not scour the
countryside at dusk looking for
flaxen-haired maidens upon
whom to nibble.

Only vampire bats feed on the
blood of mammals and have occa—
sionally bitten people. Because of
this. few animals have been as
maligned in folklore and films as
bats.

erature for centuries. But when

Dr. Robert Armstrong, Chief of
animal control, said the increased

than 100,000 licenses issued this
year, compared with 57,000 last
year. In July and August of this
yean

16,939 licenses were issued, com—
pared with l2,284 in the same
months last year, Armstrong said.

“That’s the ordinance,” Arm—
strong said. “It’s working.”

The ordinance passed in April
requires veterinarians to report pet
owners who have their dogs and
cats vaccinated for rabies. The city
then cross-checks the names to
identify pet owners who fail to pay
licensing fees. A letter is sent to the
owners, giving them 60 days to get
a license.

if owners fail to comply, they
can be brought to court. A guilty
verdict can result in a $200 fine for
failure to have a pet license. It can
cost a pet owner an additional
$200 fine if the animal is not vacci-
nated.

The Harris County Veterinary
Medicine Association opposes the
ordinance because it penalizes pet

if not an eerie ad-

owners who vaccinate their ani—
mals but does not crack down on
owners who do not. .

“I feel like the ordinance stil
does not achieve what we want it
to do,” said Dr. Marc Hays, presi—
dent the 300—member veterinary
association. “This would increase
the percentage of animals vaccinat-
ed who are licensed and not in-
crease the numbers of dogs vacci-
nated. They are raising revenue
under the guise of rabies control.”

Hays said the city should put its
efforts into canvassing neighbor-
hoods to find residents who have
not licensed or vaccinated their
pets. He said he knows of veteri-
narians who do not comply with
the ordinance, and he said the as-
sociation plans to try to get the or—
dinance changed. ‘

The city also reported that more
animals were impounded and de-
stroyed during the last two months
than in the same period last year.
The number of impounded animals
rose to 4,795 from 3,650, with the
number of destroyed animals rising
to 4,483 from 3,480.

One of Visiting Pair
I s a Rare White Tiger

By Jack Warner
Siaﬂ Writer

The tiger was upon me before I saw him.

His paws hit my shoulders; there was a
faint snarl in my ear and I stiffened, awaiting
the teeth in my neck.

“If he bites you too hard, tell me,” said
the woman at my side. “He has ’to learn his-
manners.” -

Fortunately, this tiger is only 3 months
old, weighs 18 pounds and is a perfect gentle-
man, apparently understanding even at his
tender age the bad press that can result from
chewing reporters.

He is Wei, a rare white tiger cub on dis-,
play with his half brother, Kashmir, at Zoo At-
lanta for a month beginning Saturday. They
are on loan from the Columbus, Ohio, zoo.

The cubs will be on view in the attractive
outdoor setting that eventually will be home
for a Malaysian tapir, and would have been
the temporary home of the two giant pandas
Zoo Atlanta hoped to get on loan from China.

\That deal is hung up in the “rent-a-pan-
da” controversy that led the US. Fish and
Wildlife Service to clamp a moratorium on
such loans until it can issue firm guidelines.

On paper, a couple of tiger cubs would
seem a pale substitute for the rarely seen, im-
mensely popular pandas. But Wei and Kash-
mir are sure-fire crowd-pleasers. While great
pandas are actually relatively torpid, Wei and
Kashmir are in perpetual motion; they are,
after all, kittens. .

Located between Zoo Atlanta’s most elab-
orate habitats, the Ford African Rain Forest
gorilla exhibit and the orangutan area, the
cubs’ exhibit imitates a sylvan glade.

A waterfall at the back of the habitat
feeds a large pond in the foreground through
a small, creeklike trough. A wooden bridge:
crosses the trough to a small, gazebolikei
structure.

Wei and Kashmir, released into the habi-
tat for the first time Friday, began romping
through it immediately, stalking each other,
wrestling fiercely and exploring. As Wei
crawled across the gazebo on his belly like
the deadly predator he will be in a year’s
time, Kashmir batted at his reflection in the
pool and leaped back in alarm at the spray of
water.

Both have the awkwardness typical of

By Lisa Weltson
The Associated Press

1.08 ANGELES -— Her friends
call her “the wolf woman.” She’s an
animal-rightsactivist with a taste for
adventure and a yen to be a
centerfold.

Deborah Warrick, who publishes
her own magazine devoted to her
favorite canines, cringes every time
she hears nursery rhymes like The
Three Lt'ttlt Pigs, I ittle Red Riding

”Kids are raised feaiing wolves,
and they grow up not caring if they
are killed,” says Warrick, who owns
three wolves and this year began
publishing a magazine called Wolves
and RClitft d ( a.mds

Not all popular wolf stories put the
animal in a bad light, Warrick says,
citing the Disney tilms Never Cry

But the animals have traditionally
had a bad reputation. They were

' the wild.

.. Warrick, 33, became interested in
Wild animals at an early age.

”I’ve always been into exotics,” she
says. “My parents always encouraged
that sort of thing, and we had pct

‘1‘attlesnakcs and raccoons, even an
8—foot python.”

.. She also was chosen recently as one
of 100 contestants in Playboy maga-

i.zine’s 35111 anniversary Playmate
Tsearch.

Warrick hopes to win the $35,000

' .in prize money, which she says will go
- toward her efforts in behalf of wolves.

Seven years ago, Warrick, who lives

, in the San Fernando Valley and now
‘sells 3—D computer-graphic systems to

the aerospace industry, was given her

first wolf cub.

“That’s when I realized just how

iiintelligcnt they are,” she says, noting

_.... ......--..~.—_._...__.__ "4‘. .

that a wolf‘s brain is 30 percent larger
than that of a similar-sized dog.

In fact, Warrick uses the magazine
to discourage people from attempting
to raise wolves at home. Too often,
they get into the wrong hands and
either end up put to sleep or in‘a wolf
sanctuary.

“They don’t make good pets. They
are a pack animal and will not. become
your house pet,” she says. “If they
accept you, you become a part of their
pack and must abide by pack rules.”

The magazine, which averages 65
pages, is published every other month
from Warrick’s home. It evolved from
hundreds of documents sent to her by
wolf biologists in such places as
Minnesota and Canada. A frequent
contributor, David Mech, is spending
the summer on Canada’s Ellesmere
Island studying arctic wolves.

“It became such a waste to Xerox it
all for the wolf owners I know, that I
decided to start the magazine,” she
says. Breeders and dog food manufac—
turers advertise, and so far she has
broken even byt doing the editing,
typesetting, layout and some writing
heisclf.

Wolves and Related Canids has 500
subscribers and continues to grow.
Warrick estimates there are at least
500 wolf or hybrid wolf dog owners in
California alone.

Articles on reintroducing wolves
into the United States, veterinary
advice, features on wolf owners and
lesser-known canids make up the bulk
of the magazine. Each issue also
contains a complete listing of wolf and
wildlife organizations.

From 1901 to 1930, the wolf
population in the United States was
virtually wiped out. Ranchers called it
predator control, because wolves were
attacking their livestock.

But Warrick says hunters and
trappers competed with the wolves for
other predators, virtually eliminating
the wolf’s basic food source.

Helping Humans With Sp

DEAR ANN LANDERS: Although
I have been an avid reader of your
column for 20 years, I have never
written to you. ‘

This morning, [received a letter
and pictures of animals being tor-
tured in the name of science that
made me sick. I cannot believe that
such atrocities are‘being permitted
in this country. What can we do to
put a st0p to it? :

When I saw pictures of those
adorable monkeys and precious,
dogs in cages my heart just broke.‘
Animals are God’s creatures, too,
and we cannot allow this to go on.
Please, Ann, use whatever influence
you have to put an end to these cru-
el experiments. — Pauline F., Island
Park, N.Y.

DEAR PAULINE: It’s madness all
right, but it’s some of the “animal
rights” activists that ought to be
looked into.

Extremists have infiltrated lab—
oratories posing as volunteer work-
:ers, destroyed records, bombed and
vandalized research facilities, dam-
,aged computers and poured blood
on the files. Research on infant
blindness was halted in California
for eight months while claims of an-
imal abuse were investigated. The
charges were found to be false.

The mischief visited on science
has cost millions of dollars. In April
1987, the Animal Liberation Front
claimed responsibility for the ﬁre
that destroyed two-thirds of the vet-
erinary diagnostic laboratory at the
University of California at Davis,
which resulted in more than $3 mil-
lion in damages.

lor of the Baylor (‘ollegc of Medi—

pioneer in it: nit" surgery, asks these

Animal Rights Advocates Should Weigh
aring Animals! *

 

 

questions: Would animal rights ac-
tivists refuse to accept a kidney,
heart or liver transplant if these
alone could save their lives? Such
advances would not have been pos-
sible without animal research.
Would they refuse preventive meas-
ures against polio, measles, diph-
theria and whooping cough, or
treatment for strep throat, ear in-
fections and pneumonia, all made
possible through animal research?
Do 11 million diabetics deserve the
right to life that insulin has given
them? Are cancer patients entitled

to the benefits they receive from ra-'

diation and chemotherapy?

It was in monkeys that the AIDS
virus was first identified. Should we

halt all research on this deadly...
plague because monkeys are “ador-i: j

able”? There is no way a vaccine or
a cure for this devastating disease
can be found unless we use animal
models for experiments. Computers
won’t do.

I am an animal lover, too. But

when forced to make a choice be--

tween rats, mice, monkeys, rabbits,
cats and dogs, and humanity, I
choose humanity.

Dear Connie:
Knowing of your interest in the protection of endangered species,

I am writing to inform you Of some recent favorable Congressional
action in this regard.

Last week, I supported the passage in the House of the conference
report on H.R. 1467, which authorizes the funds necessary to carry out
the Endangered Species Act of 1973 through fiscal year 1992.

This measure establishes a new Cooperative Endangered Species
Conservation Fund that provides matching grants to states that have
entered into COOperative agreements to assist in the conservation of
species listed as endangered or threatened. The conference agreement
also establishes additional requirements for the preparation and
implementation of recovery plans for endangered and threatened species
without regard to a species' classification. In addition, the agree-
ment requires the Department of Interior to monitor the status of
recovered species for at least five years after they are removed from
the endangered or threatened list.

Finally, H.R. 1467 requires the use of Turtle Excluder Devices
/ (TEDs) used on shrimp nets to prevent the capture and drowning of
endangered sea turtles. You may recall that I supported an important
House amendment to H.R. 1467 last December which mandated the use of
TEDs on shrimp boats operating in both inshore and offshore waters.

I am proud to have supported this important bill. Be assured
that I will continue to support efforts such as this that accomplish
the important objective of protecting our nation's precious plants,
birds, and mammals. Thank you again for your interest on this issue.

Sincéi§ly,

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Yarbrough:

Knowing of your interest in protecting marine mammals from
commercial fishing operations, I am writing to inform you of some
recent favorable Congressional action in this regard..

On September 26, I supported the passage in the House of H.R.
4189, a bill to authorize funds to carry out the Marine Mammal
Protection Act (MMPA) of 1972 for fiscal years 1989 through 1993. As
you know, the MMPA was created to protect and manage the marine
mammals in the United States, such as whales, seals, porpoises, sea
otters, polar bears, and walruses, by initiating a moratorium on the
taking and importation of marine mammal products.

H.R. 4189 directs the Commerce Department to prepare conservation
plans for North Pacific fur seals, Steller sea lions, and other
depleted species. In addition, the measure establishes new restric-
tions for foreign tuna fisheries and exporters. The measures require
that foreign fleets cut their porpoise mortality rate in half by the
end of the next fishing season; that each foreign nation implement a
marine mammal conservation program similar to that imposed in the
U.S.; and that the Commerce Department begin tuna embargo proceedings
against nations that do not comply with these new restrictions.

This legislation will be critical in the years ahead as the
United States lives up to its responsibility of protecting the world's
precious marine mammals.

I appreciate this Opportunity to inform you of this good news.
You may be sure of my continued support for legislation such as this
which is so crucial to the preservation of our wildlife.

With best regards, I am

Sinc€?®ly,

Every year, over 100 million animals are brutally killed to make fur products.
Most are caught in the barbaric steel-jaw Ieghold trap, which ensnares Its victim and
inflicts unspeakable pain and suffering. The terror-stricken animals may linger hours,
perhaps days, before they are finally bludgeoned, strangled or starved to death.

“Ranched” animals provide the remainder of furs purchased. These animals,
including foxes, minkS, chinchillas and rabbits, are bred only to be confined for their
entire lives In wire cages, barely afforded room to turn around. Thus confined, they
are deprived Of a natural environment and companionship, until they are finally
electrocuted, gassed or poisoned to death.

“Arizona Republic Correspondent

a" OATMAN —— Two desert tortoises,
"candidates for the federal endan-

. ' m the bottOm of an abandoned
[l’rnine shaft near here.

‘33:“. To the surprise of rescuers, both
'5’5t‘oi'toises appeared to be unharmed
emitter their 20-foot tumble into the
.fisheer-walled shaft.

“It’s pretty remarkable that they
\nveren’t hurt,” said Bob Hall, a
.r‘wildlife biologist with the Bureau of
,siLand Management’s Kingman ofﬁce.

. ,Just to be sure, the tortoises were
.‘itaken to Kingman veterinarian Wil-

of the Colorado River.

The two male tortoises were discov-
ered earlier this week by BLM wildlife
biologist Mark Cochran, who is doing
a study of the desert tortoise. ,

Cochran said it was “just fortu-
itous” that he looked into the
uncovered mine shaft dug by gold
prospectors.

Cochran said he assumed the
tortoises had been browsing for forage
when they slid down the gravelly
slope at the edge of the shaft and
tumbled 20 feet to the bottom.

He said it was impossible to tell
how long the tortoises had been there
but noted that they can survive for
weeks without food.

After ﬁnding the animals, Cochran
tossed them some food —— native
brushes and the oranges for his lunch
-— and then sought help. ‘

Friday’s rescue was then arranged
by a Bullhead City Fire Department
team that coordinated the Operation
with the BLM and the state Game
and Fish Department.

“We’re glad to come. We like to

have the practice,” said Joe Anderson
of the Fire Department team, which is
trained in mine rescue by the state
mining engineer. The team members
volunteered their time.

Before the operation began, mining
engineer Dan Maxwell, who said the
land is- owned by Sharon Steel of
Florida, sought signatures releasing
her from liability for any injuries.

Team member Rick Southey then
descended by rope into the hole and
put the animals into a burlap sack
that was hoisted to the waiting
wildlife biologists.

The tortoises, one weighing 8.5

pounds and the other 10 pounds, are .

estimated to be between 25 and 50
years old.

Arizona law has classiﬁed desert
tortoises as a protected species since
Jan. 1.

Hall said the desert tortoise, which
is native to Arizona, Nevada, Califor-
nia and Utah, also is being considered
for designation as an endangered
species by the US. Fish and Wildlife
Service.

Taste the good life Hi Seoul

By Laurence Jolidon
USA TODAY

SEOUL — I love dogs.

I have run with dogs and
nuzzled up to dogs. I’ve
watched old movies on televi-
sion ' with dogs and tracked
down veterinarians in the mid-
dle of the night to- ﬁnd medi-
cine for dogs.

I have poured out the most
intimate details of my life to
dogs, and they have listened.

And now I’ve had dog for
lunch. It wasn’t man’s best
meal, but it wasn’t bad.

Call me heartless. But it
didn’t involve any dog I knew.

In other words, that was no
dog That was my lunch.

City ofﬁcials have tried to
put Seoul’s dog meat restau-
rants on a short leash during
the Olympics. They fear of-
fending westerners, who don’t
consider dog a health food,
aphrodisiac or delicacy as
. many Asians do.

But Seoul’ s best-known
house of dog is very much in
business. In the shadow of the
ofﬁce towers that house many
of her customers is the restau-
rant Kim Poo Lee, 78, has run
for 13 years.

She has a cheery cackle, “a
puppy at home,” and seven
grandchildren.

She buys the meat of about
ﬁve mixed-breed animals a
week. “We don’t use-westem
dogs,” she says, contrary to ru-
mor that devotees favor family
pets. “The best dogs, about a
year old, are very digestible.
Better than beef.”

_ Mrs. Kim’s tile roof is black
from charcoal smoke. The din-
ing rooms are neat, with low ta—
bles and straw mats. Dishes
are clean, napkins plentiful,
the garlic buds and wild sesa-
me powder fresh. The cracked,
concrete kitchen ﬂoor is wet
from constant washing

“Nobody has asked me to
close down" said Mrs. Kim.

“A lot of foreigners exagger-

David Yoon, 25, a university se-
nior."‘I don’t feel ashamed, but
I don’t feel proud.”

Kang Hy Young, 37, one of
Mrs. Kim’s regulars, boasts
that dog meat lunches have
made him a healthier man. “I
was a little skinnyguy a year
ago, but I’ve gained 10 pounds
in the past year."

Dog meat fanciers swear a
dog diet is not only healthy —-
like ginseng, the tart-tasting
root used as a cure-all -- but
can improve sex.

“Many men come here for
that reason,” says Mrs. Kim.
“They say, after eating dog, ‘to-
night my wife will have trouble
with me.‘ ” After trying both
the soup and the sautee, I felt
frisky, but no more than usual.

The soup ($4.90) was robust,
and tasty. The sauteed meat
($14) was tender, but bland,
like veal. It was the green pep-

Animal
ations

and their
Right to
Survive

by John Mohawk

Ray Fadden owns and operates the Six Nations Indian Museum at Onchiota,
New York located in the heart of the Adirondack Mountains. He is one of those
who, by sheer force of personality, has inﬂuenced more than two generations of
Mohawks at Akwesasne by speaking passionately about two subjects: the
slander of the Indian in history and the unspeakable horror which has befallen the
natural world since the arrival of Europeans.

"It’ 5 just terrible what people have done to this beautiful land," Fadden, Who
writes under his Indian name, Tehanentorens, said recently. His voice filled with
passion. "They’ve ruined it! All in the name of greed. Just in the last forty years,
these beautiful mountains have practically become a desert. Look at the acid rain!
It kills everything. The fish can’t even survive in the lakes, even the trees and the
bugs are dying. I have to feed the bears, because there’s not enough for them to
eat. The whole food chain is destroyed, just because of greed.“

“The only threat to‘ these animals, to life on this whole planet, is man. And it’s
not the Indian, either. The Indians lived on this land for centuries and centuries.
They loved the land and the birds and animals. No. It’s modern man who’s the
problem. He’s the one who’s destroying everything and who cares nothing for
any living creatures, not even other living men."

"And the hunters," Fadden continued. ”In earlier times the lndians had to kill
animals for food to eat. But these hunters come in here from the big cities with
their guns, and call what they do 'sport.’ Sport! Give the rabbits guns, give the
deer guns, then it would be sport! But then none of those brave hunters would
ever come into the forest! Hunters!”

Ray Fadden is probably one of the most intense defenders of wildlife in the
United States. He carries on a tradition of Iroquois and other North American
Indians whose ideology of nature is built on a respect for the integrity of the birds
and animals, a respect not easily described.

The depth to which that relationship exists emerged in a 1977 document the
Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy) presented at meeting of Non-
Governmental Organizations of the United Nations to discuss the problems of the
Indigenous Peoples of the Western Hemisphere. The Haudenosaunee, on that
occasion, spoke as one voice of their desire to represent the bird and animal
species who, they said, have no voice in the modern world. It fell on Oren Lyons,
presently publisher of DAYBREAK, as a speaker for the Iroquois Grand Council,
to deliver the Indian position then. "We see no seat at the UN for the eagle," he
had said. "No seat for the whales, no representation for the animals.“

North American Indians, and most indigenous peoples, have .very ancient
relationships with the birds and animals. An lroquois oral tradition tells of a time
when peoples lived in a great forest beneath giant trees. (Early settler accounts
described this world as one in which a man could ride horseback all day through
a parklike environment and never leave the forest canopy and, though on
horseback, his head would never touch the lower branches of the trees.) The
Iroquois stories describe the forest canopy as a second sky world, and speak of
peoples who inhabit that world - four legged peoples and winged peoples.

Other Indian cultures have virtually identical ideas about the birds and animals.
The Lakota (or Sioux) regularly end their prayers with a salutation to "all my
relations," a reference to the birds and animals who are viewed, along with
humans, as children of Mother Earth. Every Indian culture carries ideas similar to
this.

Chief Seattle had said the white man doesn't care about animals, that unless
he changes his ways the whole planet will be turned to dust. In what should be a ‘

classic of ecological thinking, Seattle sent word to the president of the United
States, warning him of impending disaster if the white man continued to pollute
the earth.

Ancient European peoples once possessed a similar consciousness about
who the animals are and what was a proper relationship to have with them. Early
European caye art documents this relationship.

Through the oral literature dealing with the animals one theme is consistent
among the Iroquois: the birds and animals are not only legitimate, they are very

The idea that humans are superior to other animals is impossible to prove,
although history will indicate it is quite easily rationalized. it has proven to be a
dangerous ideology because of its logical extensions. lf humans are superior to
other life forms, are not some humans superior to other humans? It cannot be
proven that one culture is superior to another, anymore than it can be proven that
one species is superior to another, it can only be rationalized.

What can be proven is that, as a creature at the top of the planet’s food chain,

around the issue are in their infancy.

ractors ask, "What about the AIDS virus. it's a life

articulated. What is sacred - something not to be tampered with, something to be
treated with an intelligent respect -- is the complex web of life, the entirety of that
biological complexity which has created (literally created) the earth upon which
humankind stands.

In the society at large, any discussion that points to human responsibility for

dismissed as being "romantic." This is a designation that has come to mean

future biology of the planet. The CWL is no longer only an Indian ideology, but it
is not yet a popular or well-understood concept, either.

Ideas have been powerful forces propelling the on-going destruction of the
natural world and its animal and vegetable inhabitants.’ Probably the most
powerful idea is the one about man being superior to all other species. Even
people who accept the tenets of that idea have come to agree it does not excuse

the irresponsible destruction of all kinds of life. The second idea, articulated by
English philosopher John Locke, is that the proper application of human
rationality is to the transformation of nature into money. Left unchecked, Locke’s
thinking will surely bring Chief Seattle’s prophecy of the world turned to dust to
pass. It has become the main avenue by which modern, “Economic“ man has
allowed himself to disregard all other consequences of his money-transforming
activities. "Nothing wrong with making a buck,“ is the common expression. Even
when there is a known environmental price for unchecked economic
development, the answer then becgmes: “Science will find an answer." Can
science bring back an extinct animal? .

A third ideology, probably the most powerful idea in the arsenal of ideologies
that could destroy the world, involves progress. Progress is a complicated
ideology based on an assumption that the accumulation of technology and
knowledge are moving humankind inexorably toward a better future. It is such a .
powerful idea that it has been used to rationalize flooding vital riverways, draining
swamps, destroying forests, building roads through river bottoms, even for
mundane purposes such as using powers of eminent domain to build shopping
plazas. Those ideas are often applied W‘th little or no evaluation of the long-range
consequences to the animal and bi' 'Jns. It is so widely assumed that if
something involves the massive applicau. of technology and human resources
that it must, by its very nature, be progressive, and, in the contemporary world.
people "cannot stop progress."

There is a kind of progress in the serious introduction of ideas of human
responsibility based on tribal ideologies. The ideas Locke articulated about man
and nature were enacted practically without restraint until the twentieth century.
The dramatic extinction and near extinction of numerous species of large animals
was fueled by the demands of the marketplace. The idea of transforming nature
directly into money changed human relations to animal species in a specific way.

Changing ideologies towards animals can be seen in the fur trade. The wolf is a common clan
effigy for Native Americans. The fur trade introduced to Indians the act of killing for com-
merce, like the 1923 trapper in the middle photo. Today, furs are often a sole source of

likely to eat only until hunger abated and to use hides to make clothing until no
more clothing was needed and to kill no more until then. Economic man killed the

beaver to sell some part of it in exchange for money, and the hunger for money

was never abated. .
The result of these ideas has been a kind of holocaust in the modern world.
Consider, for a moment, the slaughterof the buffalo. When Economic man

arrived there were 60 million buffaloes in North America. By 1900, only 36 7

individuals survived in the United States. EVentually laws were passed which
provided for the preservation of this remnant buffalo herd, but the great herds of
the past live only in the imagination. ‘

Millions of passenger pigeons once darkened the skies over North America.
The Iroquois would feast for days on the great number of pigeons that they were
able to hunt with bow and arrow or blowgun. Their numbers were so great, it was
unimaginable that this bird would ever become extinct. It did. During the
nineteenth century sporting guns were brought to bear on the migrating bird
populations until the skies grew clear and quiet. In the cities women wore hats
bearing feathers of exotic birds slaughtered by the hundreds of thousands for
their plumes. It was a rapacious age.

We are living in the Great Age of Extinction, which began around 1680, at
about the same time Locke was formulating his theory of possessive
individualism. From that point, great birds and animals began disappearing from
the face of the earth, never to be seen again. It is true that nature also causes
some species’ixtinction, but nothing has ever happened in nature to rival the
effects of the expansion of western cultures. It has been estimated that at the time
of the demise of the dinosaurs, extinction was occurring at a rate of only one
species every thousand years.

Some of the most magnificent creatures that ever roamed the earth have
disappeared over the past three centuries, their faces never to be seen again.
Among them was the largest bird that ever lived, the elephant bird, ten feet tall
with an egg measuring three feet in diameter. The passenger 'pigeon, the miriam
elk, and hundreds of others have paid the price for progress. The process is
continuing at an accelerated rate in those areas of the planet where wilderness
still exists.

The slaughter of birds and buffalo was challenged around the turn of the
century with movements to create game sanctuaries and greatly expanded fish
and game laws and enforcement. There is a sense in America that because of
these efforts, bird and animal life has been saved, but it is a false sense of
security. During the 19603 it became clear the bird life was threatened by a silent
killer - chemical poisons. DDT has caused imperfections in bird eggs which have
resulted in fewer new hatchings. Chemicals in the rivers are absorbed by the fish,
who are then eaten by the birds, who in turn are poisoned. Rodent and farm pest
poisons are absorbed into the blood of meat eating birds like eagles and hawks.

Throughout this period, however, habitat distruction continues to be the
' persistent threat to the existence of most birds and animals. Habitat destruction is
basically a by product of economic development. There cannot be pupfish in
ponds drained for irrigation. Beaver cannot live where condominiums are built.
River bottoms, a rich source of waterfowl breeding grounds, are favorite sites for
road builders. Swamps, necessary for amphibians and the seclusion of hundreds
of birds and other life forms are drained to build housing developments and
shopping malls. The threats to birds and animals increases daily so that more
peOple may enjoy "the better life" of suburban expansion. There is no relief in
sight. ‘

Although there are some concerned groups who can find money and political
influence for some of the great animals such as wolves and mountain lions, many
of the so-called lower species have no champions. Whole species of lizards, tiny
fishes, snails, snakes and any number of insects and worms are threatened with
extinction as their habitat is invaded by developers.

Most people know the American Indian cultures have been symbols of
opposition to__the kind of thinking that values economic development above
nature. Some anthropologists will offer the argument the Indians weren’t really
naturalists and that Indians caused the extinction of some species of animals long
before western man arrived on the scene. There will be discussions about the fact
that Indians and other natural world people were (and continue to be) predators

.. whose primary interest in animals was as a food supply.

All those arguments miss the point. Closer investigation will reveal great
messages, even cosmological ethics in many of the American Indian cultures that
cautioned human beings not to disregard the animal and plant worlds. A true
understanding of the origins of many of the ceremonies among lndian peoples
will uncover both physical and spiritual connections designed to maintain the
balance between the human and animal nations.

It may be true that the days of the great herds of grass eating mammals have
ended on the North American great plains, but it is also true that humans can
create a future world which maintains space for all its creatures. The Indian
cultures provide rich imagery and a conceptual reference which can inform future
generations about the validity and legitimacy of the bird and animal families. As a
society we are well advised to continue to teach our children that animal life is
sacred and provide them with both information and inspiration which will help
them make decisions about the future of life on the planet.

Some lndian cultures, we have seen, believe protection and advocacy for the
animal nations is also a political priority. Ancient lndian cultures proposed a
message about animals that modern people have been unwilling to hear.

The ancient Hopi, for example, predicted that because of disrespect for
Nature, humankind will upset the balance and bring about a Purification -— a time
when nature’s forces will destroy all but those that have a proper relationship to
the land and all its creatures. An Iroquois prophesy, while not as dramatic, also
points to a kind of Purification where nature fights back. Both prophetic traditions
are based on an ideology which maintains there is a threshold of abuse beyond
which the Web of Life will be torn apart and all lifeforms will suffer enormously.

If, as most modern humanists are willing to concede, a Web of Life exists, it is
characterized by its infinite complexity. The ancient ones accepted the
complexity, without having to dissect it. It was a belief system. Economic Man,
as none before him, requires scientific proof of the complexity of nature. For
Economic man to continue to exist, his exploitation of nature must expand. For
that to happen, nature must yield.

Economic Man may be approaching his own extinction, a fate consistent with
Hopi prophecy. Acid rain is produced by burning high sulfur coal to produce
electricity. Acid rain is an economic product for which the only consumers are the
natural world. It is a deadly gift. It threatens the Web of Life, causing food
shortages for the bear and fish, killing the eggs of the trout. All of this is familiar to
the astute (Ray Fadden has pointed out the decline in the insect and other life in
the Adirondack mountains for years), but too little is being done about it. The
technology exists to greatly reduce the acidity of acid rain, but neither the
spiritual nor the political will to pay the costs of that reduction has materialized.

for fun and profit. Sir George Gore, on a hunt along the Missouri, and Platte rivers
killed 2, 000 Buffalo, 1600 Deer and Elk, and 105 Bears, leaving a trail of carrion

Today some twenty-five thousand Buffalo remain in North America. By 1883
there were only one thousand left. .‘is they were killed at a rate of one million per
year. To the Plains lndians, the Buffalo was a sacred gift and a major source of

The financial profits to be made by not acting have much more cultural validity
than the overall quality of life in nature.

Disaster has already visited the animal world. By the end of the century, even

without a catastrophe, practically all the continent’s great animals will be confined
to a few parks where they will be subjected to "management" by humans. Despite
heroic efforts to bring some species back from the brink of extinction, species
such as the California Condor may have already sunk beneath the critical mass of
numbers required to keep them a viable part of nature.

What can be done to save Ray Fadden’s friend, the bear? What is needed is a
change in the way people relate to the natural world from both the positive and
the negative perspectives. First, there needs to be a cultural recognition that the
blind exploitation of nature, the transformation of nature into money, is a process
which must be evaluated against limits designed to protect and preserve the Web
of Life. Second, there needs to be in place a socialization process-- a way for
humans to experience the validity of nature which exposes everyone to the world
of animals through education and through actual experience in the wilderness.
People need to experience nature as real and valid and not something theoretical
and abstract. Only people who know the reality of nature can be expected to
understand the need to protect and preserve the birds and animals of the planet.

The ancient lndians believed the birds and animals to be cohabitors of the
world. Although in the West it has long been argued animals have no "souls," or
"spirits," that animals may or may not feel pain, may or may not experience love
and anguish, such discussions never arose in the ancient Indian world where
animals were believed to be legitimate beings. Anthropocentrism has been the
basis of the argument which has allowed the exploitation of the animal world.

Many people are starting to accept that the human—centered idea is one of the
problems pushing us on the road to ecological disaster. The old lndians knew of
a way of thinking about the problem. There was an internal principle in many of
the native cultures that the human society as a whole must take stock of the
natural patterns within w'hiCh it lives and must adapt its activities to "flow"
respectquy with the movements and cycles of nature. When the West adopts the
practice of seeing the animal world through lndian eyes we will surely'have the
ideological and emotional tools to struggle for a better world. In this Age of
Extinction we would have made a positive, indeed a truly progressive, step.

Photos and Story
by Tim Johnson

At ﬁrst glance the St. Regis Mohawk
Reservation looks like the kind of
community where any American family
would love to have a summer cottage.
Green grasses line the blue waters of
tributaries as they feed the mighty St.
Lawrence River along its southern
Shore. Even its Mohawk name conjures
_ up notions of pristine beauty. More
commonly referred to as Akwesasne or
"Land Where the Partridge Drums," it is
a place which has sustained
generations of healthy Mohawk families.

But lurking beneath the surface of
this scenic tranquility is a silent menace.
Akwesasne is under attack from
industrial pollution. Spurred by the
construction of the St. Lawrence
Seaway in 1954, industries from both
United States and Canada ﬂocked to its
shores. Their intentions, however, were
not like those of the waterfowl who use
the region as a fresh water habitat for
seasonal migrations. Corporations use
the river as an open sewer for the
disposal of industrial waste.

l traveled to Akwesasne because I
had heard of the Mohawks’ fight against
the pollution of the water. By taking on
some of America’s industrial giants they
were not only winning praise from other
Indian nations facing similar problems,
but also from non-Indian towns
bordering the reservation. As they said,
pollution doesn’t discriminate.

I had also heard that the Mohawks
were working cooperatively on research
studies with the wildlife pathologist from
New York State’s Department of
Environmental Conservation (DEC), Dr.

Ward Stone. Word had it that Ward
Stone, an alleged maverick, cared more
about truth than about politics or
bureaucratic chest thumping.

.Stone was invited to conduct tests at
Akwesasne in June of 1985, after
Mohawk midwife Katsi Cook suspected
pollutants were moving through the
food chain, contaminating women’s
breast milk and causing birth anomolies.
His first test was the examination of a
fourteen year old snapping turtle.
Captured within three hundred feet of
the General Motors Landfill, one of
several industrial sites identified by the
Mohawks as a Source of toxic pollution,
the turtle was found loaded with deadly
chemicals.

Analysis of fat tisSue by gas
chromophotography revealed PCB
(polychlorinated biphenals) at a
shocking level of eight hundred thirty
five parts per million (ppm). Highly toxic
dioxins, one of which was used in Agent
Orange, and dibenzofurans were also
recorded at extremely high levels. The
tip of Akwesasne’s pollution‘ iceberg
was discovered.

Ward Stone burst through the door
of the Office of Environmental Health,
where I had been speaking with James
Ransom, Director of Environmental
Programs for the St. Regis Mohawk
Tribe. Stone had just returned from a
meeting with officials at Reynolds
Metals, an aluminum plant one mile
upriver and seemed pleased that, for
once, he was getting some cooperation.
in April, Reynolds had held a news
conference at which their vice president
claimed they didn’t use PCBs and they
didn’t pollute. "They should have to eat
those words," said Stone. Soon, we

were driving towards Reynolds Metals -
where Stone intended to show us why.
"It’s a very interesting area because
there are a number of rivers that come
into Akwesasne," said Stone. "This is the
Raquette River‘and just up here a bit is

the Grass River, on the other side of.

Reynolds.

"When you have major tributaries
coming in like these rivers, you’re also
talking about a place where there is a
good habitat for fish, at the mouth of
those rivers. That’s very important here
because the people of Akwesasne have,
traditionally, done a lot of fishing and
eat a lot of fish."

The early Summer day was
extremely hot, dry and windy. Although
physically uncomfortable, it provided a
graphic demonstration of airborn
industrial pollution for Stone’s outdoor
lecture. Driving alongside the plant on a
public road, we could see the pollution
rising from the Reynolds facility. A
whitish particulate matter wafted in the
air high above its pipes and smoke
stacks, drifting toward Cornwall Island,
where hundreds of Akwesasne’s eight
thousand Mohawks live. .

“They (Reynolds Metal) are also a
source of fluoride air emmissions,” said
Ransom. “The wind direction is
predominantly towards Cornwall Island,

‘which is also part of the reserve. The

island is being contaminated with
ﬂuoride. We’ve had cattle on the island
that have died because of clinical
fluorosis. They eat the grass and their
teeth become brittle and fall out. We’re
also seeing birth defects.“

Further up, where the road curved
around the back of the Reynolds plant,
Stone pointed to a small inlet along the

Biologist Ward Stone along St. Lawrence River

St. Lawrence. “That’s their 002
discharge,“ said Stone, "and that’s
where Kenny Jock and I walked up that
stream and we found high levels of
PCBs in that stream and in that cove. So
l changed the name of that stream to
'Biphenal Brook,’ in honor of the PC83
going through there. And since it’s very
difficult to find living things in that cove
like you’d expect to, invertebrates, I
named that ’Dead Clam Cove.”

The descriptions roll from Stone’s
adventurous voice as if he were reading
from the pages of "Treasure island.” But
Stone and Ransom are not pirates
searching for buried treasure. They are
scientists (Stone is THE Wildlife
pathologist for New York State)
collecting and compiling evidence that
links industries to toxic pollution.

Along the back of the plant Stone
showed me a trailer he said was the
company’s carbon filtration car, and
identified open storage tanks which held
hazardous waste before it was
discharged through four separate areas.
Behind a fence, black plastic covered a
large area that Stone termed "hot." The

soil contained PCBs above fifty parts _
per million, which is high enough to be
considered hazardous waste. Much of
this area sloped down to a ditch
bordering the public road. A red stake
indicated where the PCB level was
above one hundred and eighty eight
parts-per—million.

'l'his ditch has got to be remediated,
dug up and taken out of here,“ said
Stone. “I’d like to see it lower than ten
parts per million. One of the reasons we
stopped them discharging the water
was that even if you had pure distilled

p

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

water at the top of the hill and you
discharged it down through here, it
would resuspend material that’s in the
mud here, and that muddy water would
carry PCBs down into the river.“

The two men relayed statistics like
computer tapes. But, how can people
relate to the poisonous levels of PCBs in
terms of parts-per-million. "One part—per-
million of PCB in mink will cause
reproductive failure and death,” said
Stone. And: ”You take two pounds of
PCBs and distribute it through a million
pounds of fish and they’re unsuitable for
human consumption."

”Reynolds claims they aren’t the
source of it," said Ransom. "They’re
saying their intake is over here and
they’re discharging the same thing back
out, but it is pretty easy to test.” [Such
tests have proven that one source of
pollution is Reynolds]

Ransom said they have also found
polynuclear aeromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) at Reynolds’ SPEDES (State
Pollution Discharge Elimination System)
Outfalls. Simply put, SPEDES are pipes
which discharge waste water into the
river. PAHs are cancer causing
chemicals. “[Alex Ewen, a foundation
researcher compiling a national
statistical profile of Native Americans,
reports that in Franklin County, which
includes Akwesasne, nearly fifty percent
of the all deaths were caused by cancer
in 1986.]

"I guess it took me an hour and a half
on Reynolds’ land to find that they were
badly contaminated with P083," said
Stone. "i don’t know why other people
from DEC, who must have spent
thousands of hours in there, did not
identify the problem.

”I’d like to see an investigation, an

actual hearing into why my government,
the State of New York, did not discover
these problems sooner. They should
have been picked up more than a
decade ago. Because that wasn’t done
in a timely fashion, here we are in 1988
just really finding the PCB problem at
Reynolds Aluminum. At least four
discharges are putting PCBs into the
river right now as we speak."
' Stone’s pressuring remarks do not
go over well with Department higher-
ups in the state capital of Albany. They
paint Stone as a maverick to powerful
corporate moguls and politicians, but
they have also has endeared him to the
public he serves. Stone simply believes
in his data and gives straightforward
and honest answers to the questions
from the press. He refuses to play the
game and will not accept that public
information should be kept a secret. The
attitude has cost him professionally but
he gives no indication of backing down.

Stone argues that while more studies
add to the pile of evidence, what is
needed now to correct the serious
health problems at Akwesasne is
political action from Albany. And that, he
intimates, is in short supply.

While former DEC Commissioner
Henry Williams supported his studies,
hired Mohawk interns to collect and
compile data, and even traveled with

him in 1985 to see what was going on at
Akwetasne, the position of the new
Commissioner, Thomas Jorling, is more
threatening, said Stone. Jorling told him
in a letter that he doesn’t want to have
to warn Stone again about talking to the
press. Jorling’s enormous power as
commissioner doesn’t intimidate Stone,

he said, because, “l believe that I’m

correct. The data is on my side.“

In the meantime, pollutants continue
pouring into the river, threatening an
environment that sustains humans and
other natural life.

Driving thorugh a nearly overgrown
dirt road, we spun around to where the
General Motors Central Foundry
Division has a landfill that borders the
reservation and sits on the banks of the
St. Lawrence River. From a nearby hill,
we looked across to where a larger
mound lurched from the landscape. But
this was not one of nature’s creations, it
was a huge pile of manmade garbage.

 

 

 

It was here that Douglas Smoke, a
Mohawk environmental technician,
captured the first snapping turtle for
Stone’s analysis. “The reason I was
studying the turtle was because the
turtle lives in the same place year after
year, and they’ll eat all sorts of things,"
said Stone. "They'll eat vegetation,
aquatic insects, and in the case of the
snapping turtle, they’ll take a duckling
off the water. So what you find in the
snapping turtle, being that they lived in
the same place year after year, would
indicate the kinds of pollutants that are
local."

For the Mohawks it was also
symbolic. According to the Iroquois
traditional creation story, the North
American continent is supported on the
back of a giant turtle. in addition, it was
the birds and animals who aided the
survival of the- very first humans.
"General Motors is an EPA

(Environmental Protection Agency)

Superfund site," said Ransom. “They’ve
identified about three hundred and fifty
thousand cubic yards of PCB
contaminated waste materials and soils
on their site. We think that it is probably
the biggest PCB disposal site in the
United States.“

The site also contains other solvents
and metals. It was wide open for years
and Mohawk children played among the
dangerous waste while other adults

went in to pick up scrap. Until June
1985, they were still dumping and there
wasn’t even a fence erected to keep
people out, let alone public information
detailing the hazardous nature of the
site.

”They capped their landfill last year, a
one foot clay layer with a plastic liner
underneath it," said Ransom. ”Under
state law you need a minimum of a four
foot clay cap for a PCB site. it cost them
$500,000 just for a temporary cap - a
drop in the bucket for them.

“All they have done is put a cap over
it to stop rainfall from going through it,
but they haven’t addressed the other
component of groundwater migrating
through it and into the river."

Down near the landfill Stone worked
his way through tall marshy grasses to
the water’s edge. He' collected water
samples in two canning jars for analysis
at his laboratory. Back up top he
noticed a bull frog sunning itself on the
water. Ever the wildlife biologist, he
picked up a large rock and threw it near
the frog. it didn’t move.

Stone said the frog was not behaving
normally and recalled earlier tests they
had conducted. “We found frogs that
couldn’t hop straight, that had
enormous levels of PCBs, over two
thousand parts-per-million on a lipid
basis in their carcass," he said.

fish and frogs, which come in direct

vulnerable. ”They (toxics) have a low
water solubility but they have a
considerable higher solubility in fats and
oils," said Stone. "Thereby they’ll leave
water and go right through the skin of
fish and through the gills. Frogs will do
the same thing." In essence, frogs are
like sponges, soaking up toxics directly
from the environment. The frog that
wouldn’t move may have been close to
neurological failure. ,

Reynolds Metals and General Motors
are not the only industries the Mohawks
are concerned about. The Aluminum
Company of America (ALCOA) is
licensed under State permit to
discharge into the Grass River. They“
have eleven separate sites on the New
York State list of inactive hazardous
waste around Massena.

On the Canadian side of the St.
Lawrence River are a number of
industries. Domtar Paper emits an
average of three hundred and eighty
pounds of sulfur compounds into the
atmosphere each day. A Ministry of
Environment Report states that
Courtaulds and British Cellophane
Limited are among the most toxic of the
Cornwall industries and are listed
among the hazardous sites in the
province of Ontario. Canadian industries
Limited is a chloro-alkalai plant. "They
are discharging mercury into the river,
and it is showing up in the fish," said
Ransom.

“The Canadian side is interesting,“
said Ransom. "l'd like to say that their
Solution to the Pollution is Dilution. All
they do is extend their sewage pipe out
into the middle of the river. They figure
the large volume of water will dilute it.“

The impact of pollution on the

Akwesasne community has been
significant. Some of the homes near the
GM landfill were advised not to plant
gardens. A tribal school located near
the landfill has been seriously hurt by
the pollution. Enrollment of children who
recieved traditional Mohawk education
at the Akwesasne Freedom School
declined from ninety to only twenty five
students. The school is being moved.
And for those who used to feed their
families fish from the once clean and
bountiful river, well, those days are
gone. -
Tony Barnes, a Mohawk elder, was
watering his garden when we drove up.
"Hey mister. You seen any lndians?“
kidded Stone. Barnes has been fishing
the surrounding waters for most of his
life. He tells fish stories like the ones that
got away, and the ones he caught that
were "this big." But he also tells you
seriously about the bullheads whose
"skin is gone," of fish whose mouths are
"writhing away," and of "deformed fish
with no backbone."

A fish study costing two hundred and
seventy thousand dollars is currently
being conducted, sponsored by General
Motors. Eight fishermen from the

reservation, including Barnes, are
collecting fish which are sent to the DEC
for analysis. "Our fishermen have found
fish that appear to have tumors and
lessions on them," said Ransom.

"You have to question whether or
not the Mohawks will ever again be able
to freely eat, freely utilize that fish
resource in that river," said Stone. "And i
think its very unlikely to happen for a
very, very long time, if ever. Probably
never, the way we’re going."

The Mohawks at Akwesasnem are
very concerned for their future.

Traditional cultural beliefs give them an
environmental awareness that the
younger people are now translating into
terms modern industry can understand.
They have a traditional saying that the
current actions should impact
benefitially upon the seventh generation
yet to come. It is their way of
connecting to the future.

In just one generation, the Mohawks
have seen unprecedented destruction of
their environment. Where is the logic
behind such development?, they ask.
The Iroquois creation story is a
marvelous allegorical tale in which
humanity is supported on the back of a
turtle. It is true that technological
realities of the industrial world are just
now catching up to observational and
spiritual realities of the Native world.
But, is it too late and are people really

listening?

Dr. Anthony J. Calio
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

Department of Commerce
Washington, D.C. 20230

Dear Dr. Calio:

We are extremely concerned about the way the National Marine
Fisheries Service handled the entanglement incident involving the
tuna purse seiner, White Dove Too and three humpback whales off
the coast of Cape Cod on August 29, 1986.

The results of the investigation and Fisheries' final action have
recently been announced. We question these findings and we are
quite concerned about the public statements being made by
Margareet Matera, the NMFS General Council for this case.

The "lowest fine allowable" is not the appropriate fine which
should have been administered in this case. Many eyewitnesses
verify that the operators of the White Dove Too either saw the
whales and set their nets intentionately, or were so careless in
their fishing practices that they needlessly endangered the
whales. Ms. Matera's comments appear to clearly demonstrate a
bias in favor of the tuna fishermen and we feel that this bias
ultimately led to an inappropriate conclusion in this case.

Enclosed are four photographs which clearly show the entrapment

of the humpback whales. The incident took place in front of the
whalewatch boat, Dolphin VI and its (appromximately) ninety
passengers. These passengers were alerted as to what the tuna
boat was doing, and all stood helpless while the White Dove Too
completed its entrapment of the whales.

At the center of our argument is Ms. Matera's statement (which we
confirmed by'telephone) whereby she said that the fishermen were
in a small skiff deploying the net and that they would be crazy
to encircle whales. As the photograph shows, it was the much

larger White Dove Too which set the net and that the whales were
clearly visible.

We respectfully point out that there were other tuna boats in the
area, that there were spotter aircraft overhead and that there
would would have been one primary area of concern to the
fishermen on board the White Dove Too ~— the area directly in the
center of the net as it was being deployed.

It is our understanding that these nets are not set blindly, that
the fishermen look for and set these purse seine nets when

tuna are spotted and that the nets will be relocated when the
tuna are seen to move. '

 




We further bring to your attention Ms. Matera's unfortunate
statements against the citizens on board the whalewatch boat.
It is common knowledge that the National Marine Fisheries
Service openly invites citizen participation in the enforcement
of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Ms. Matera's threat of
possible retaliation against the operators of the whalewatch
boat for their pressuring of the tuna boat (which came 20
minutes after no action from the White Dove Too to free the
whales) certainly does not reflect NOAA's previous support of
cooperation between the agency and the general public.

When contacted by telephone, Ms. Matera further demonstrated an
opinionated view concerning the incident by making comments
which confirm those quoted in the enclosed articles.

In light of these circumstances, we request an open meeting with
you so as to review the specifics of this case, the questionable
attitude and actions of the General Council, and NOAA's policy
concerning public participation in reporting violations of the
Marine Mammal Protection Act.

Sincerely,

HELP NEEDED FOR WORLD'S MOST ENDANGERED CETACEAN

The "Baiji", or Yangtze River Dolphin, is only found in China's
Yangtze River - less than 200 are estimated to exist. Despite this grim
situation, there is hope, and it is embodied in Professor Zhou Kaiya,
one of the leading authorities on Lipotes vexillifer, who has been
investigating this strange and illusive dolphin for nearly 20 years.
Professor Zhou is Dean of the Biology Department of Nanjing Normal
University and Head of the Cetacean Research Group; he has written
dozens of scientific papers on this animal. But his interests are also
wonderfully broad: trained originally as an ornithologist, he has
studied dolphins, terrestrial mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians,
fishes and fossils. His approach is multifaceted also, including
biochemistry, anatomy, morphology, physiology, systematics, and ecology.
Among his many qualifications are: scientific advisorship on national &
international conservation organizations; member of the editorial boards
of some of China’s most important scientific journals; officer and
member of numerous national and international scientific and
conservation organizations. He is an active and accomplished educator.

For years Professor Zhou has documented the decline in Baiji and he
has now, after laborius consideration, concluded that the only way to

conserve this animal is by creating a semi-natural reserve in which to

rear the dolphins - they are too diSperse on the Yangzte to be able to

manage and each year the river is ever more polluted and ever more
heavilly travelled. However, the technology for canug for captive
dolphins is poorly deve10ped in China.

It is of the greatest urgency that Professor Zhou obtain expert

assistance in deve10ping this last effort to preserve the Baiji.

 




He needs to visit the USA: to discuss plans and different
techniques in rearing dolphins; to consult libraries; to visit
scientific and conservation organizations and institutions. To
accomplish this, financial support is needed to bring Professor Zhou to
the USA and provide funds for him to pay for travel, food and lodging
while inthe country. A.minimum¢of$ 3,000is needed(the limited funds
that are likely to be available would obviously stretch farther if
individuals could assist with food and/or lodging). The visit is
planned for June of 1986.

In an effort to reciprocate, Professor Zhou has offered to give
lectures, and the topics include:

1) Marine mammal research in China (reviewing investigation and
management of all marine mammals in China).

2) The World's most endangered cetacean - the Baiji - and plans to
conserve it. (A project to translocate Baiji from the mainstream of the
Yangzte to a seminatural reserve).

3) Comparative morphology of the eye and kidney between fresh water and

coastal pOpulations of finless porpoises, Neophocaena phocaenoides.

4) Chinese lizards of the Genus Gecko (An indepth treatise by China's
authority on geckos).
5) NanjingNormal University (A description of educational techniques
and facilities).

Professor Zhou, as well as being fully fluent in English, is an

excellent speaker.

We urgently need assistance with four points:
A) "Official" letters of invitation on your organization's letter head;
B) Collaboration - offers to meet with and discuss problems and solutions with Zhou;
C) Logistic support - offers to host Zhou and to help him with logistical problems
(e.g. making travel connections) while he is in your area;
D) Financial support — offers of honoraria for speaking or small grants, even if for
only $100 or $50, will be much appreciated.

AnyOne needing further imformation, or with offers to help, please contact:

leader ousted

from fish negotiating team

By JIM KLAHN
The Associated Press

SEATTLE —— A Greenpeace
leader on a U. S. team negoti-
ating with Japan over the
high- ~seas catch of North
American salmon said
Wednesday he was ousted by
State Department officials
who bowed to pressure from
Japan.

However, a State Depart»
ment officer said while the
dismissal was regrettable, a
Greenpeace protest against
the Japanese left the agency

little choice but to dismiss

Alan Reichman as a delegate.
Reichman said Wednesday
he was told Monday, 18 hours
before he was to leave Seattle
for Tokyo, that he was being
removed as a delegate mem-
ber because of protests Reich-

man had participated in last‘

November at the Japanese
Consulate in Vancouver, Bri-
tish Columbia.

The decision to remove him
came so late, said Reichman,
that there was no time to
appoint another person from
the environmental community
to the delegation.

l

1

«kn eighth round of talks

between the Japanese and
Americans, which have been
marked by threats of boycotts
and the possil ility of “fish
wars,” was to begin Thursday
in Tokyo. Talks were to last
two days.

Though the talks revolve
around the catch by Japanese
fishermen of U.S. and Canadi-
an salmon, Greenpeace and
other environmental groups
have long criticized the land-
based fishery, using monofila—
ment nets up to nine miles
long, of indiscrimately killing
thousands of Dali’s porpoises,
seabirds and other creatures.

“The State Department has
used that situation in Vancou-
ver as a convenient way to

appease Japan by removing
me from the delegation,” said
Reichman, who is driftnets
project coordinator for Green-
peace. ’

Stetson Tinkham, fisheries
affairs officer for the State
Department in Washington,
DC, said the situation sent
the wrong signals to the envi-
ronmental community, espe—
cially since Reichman had
been named only last month,
after talks had gone seven
rounds. He was the only
.member from the environ-
mental movement, and also
had the blessings of some
congressional members on
Capitol Hill, said Tinkham.

However, Tinkham defend—
ed the move by deputy assist-
ant ‘secretary of state Ed
Wolfe, leading the talks, and
his superiors to fire Reichman
from the delegation.

“Two things happened

“The Japanese began to send
signals they were not happy
with him, and someone saw a
cable about the Vancouver
protest. They said, ‘That’ s not
the kind of person we should
send’” to the talks with Ja-
pan.

Tinkham also said the envi-
ronmental community could
have been represented at the
talks, if Reichman had relin-
quished his seat earlier.

Reichman ‘said he didn’t
regret that he had failed to
mention his participation in
the protest, in which Green-
peace unfurled a huge banner
protesting the driftnet fish-
ery

Greenpeace has made gre 1t
strides with non-violent civii
disobedience, said Reichman,
and its members “believe pro-
test is a fundamental right '11
democratic societies.”

“We are obviously con-
cerned that the environmental
voice has been quieted again,
and that our State Depart-
ment supported Japan’s re-
quest,” said Reichman.

simultaneously,” he said.

ANIMALS International V/18 (1985)

Threat to Endangered Sea Turtles

At the request of the Puerto Rican Department of Natural
Resources, WSPA’s Western Hemisphere Regional Office
has initiated an emergency effort to save thousands of
endangered marine turtles threatened with the loss of their
ancient Caribbean habitat.

Last February, the 330-foot passenger ferry A. Regina ran
aground 200 yards off Mona Island, Puerto Rico, and was
abandoned by her crew. The vessel is located in the largest
known nesting and feeding aggregation of endangered
hawksbill turtles in the Caribbean. As rough seas pound the
ship, a huge cloud of silt and sand is created. This plume of
sediment has spread beyond the immediate area surrounding
A. Regina, stressing the fragile food chain on which the turtles
and their young depend. This section of the coastline is used
not only by the hawksbill, but also three other species of turtle
--- "the green, leatherback and loggerhead.

Since the ship ran aground, the Puerto Rican Department of
Natural Resources has tried, without success, to have the
ship removed and recently requested WSPA’s assistance in
pressuring the U.S. Government to act.

WSIE’A is asking all individual members and member
sooneties to become involved in this campaign by
contacting the U.S. Embasies in their respective
countries, or writing to their U.S. Congresspeople and
Senators, urging that the A. Regina be removed as
quickly as possible.

Time is critical if these animals are to be saved.

Accord Is Reached
071 Japan ’3 Catches
0f U.S. Salmon \

By KEN WELLS

Staff Reporter of THE WALL S1 REET JOURNAL

The State Department said it reached
an agreement that will reduce Japanese
catches of U.S.-spawned salmdn in the
north Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea. The
accord calls for phasing out some J apa-
nese ﬂeets by 1994 and moving the bound-
ary where other ﬂeets may fish about 35
miles west.

In exchange-the U.S. plans to allow
Japanese fleets to harvest about 500,000
metric tons of bottom fish from the U.S.
ZOO-mile fishery conservation zone this
year. Government negotiators had threat-
ened to hold up the rest pending a resolu-
tion of the salmon issue. '

Japan, in turn, had threatened to close
its markets to U.S. ﬁshermen; Alaska fish-
ermen sell about 70% of their annual $250
million sockeye salmon harvest to Japan.

The agreement, aimed at defusing a
growing bilateral rift was criticized by
some American fisheries groups, which
charged that it offers little relief to certain
Alaskan and Pacific Northwest commer-
cial fishermen on rivers whose salmon
rims are being decimated by Japanese “in-
terceptions” of U.S. salmon stocks.

The Canadian government is a third
party in international agreements covering
the North Pacific and Bering Sea, and an
estimated 5% of Canadian-spawned salmon ~
are thought to end up in Japanese nets.

 

military bases, landing rights,
other economic interests --
who knows what they are.”
Mitchell, Cowles and Blake
said they may try other tac-
tics to block Japanese har-

vests, like lobbying for new
federal laws or pushing the
state’s congressional delega-
tion for more Coast Guard
patrols to keep closer watch
on the Japanese fleet..

 




NATIONAL FISHERMAN APRIL 1986

Accord looks possible in U. 8. /Japan salmon talks

By Brad Warren .

A compromise on Japan’s high-seas
salmon interceptions seemed almost within
reach as the seventh round of U.S.-Japan
salmon talks concluded Feb- 8. Under the
cempromise, the two nations would co-
operate to improve catch data, and Japan

would crack down on members of its high-

seas salmon ﬂeet found fishing out of
designated areas and in waters where
American fish predominate.

The sweeping time-area closures .original- ‘
,ly sought by the United States would not be

attempted until the two nations agree more
closely on two key questions:

0 How many American salmon do the
Japanese catch? '

0 How can that number be cut without
disrupting their harvest of Asian salmon?

The talks, spurred by a clamor to stop
Japan’s interception of American salmon
(estimated variously at 200,000 to 1 million
fish per year) ended with indications that
Japan’s chief negotiator was ready to make
a deal but needed approval from govern-
ment and industry leaders back in Tokyo,
American sources said.

“There were actual discussions rather
than each side slapping pieces of paper at
each other,” said' a State Department
ﬁsheries ofﬁcial. Although “substantial
areas of disagreement” still exist, ‘ the
deadlock that stymied negotiators and
threatened to escalate into a ﬁsh-trade war
in January appears to have thawed, the of-
ﬁcial added.

What made this thaw possible was a State

Negotiation by threat

By Brad Matsen

_Department decision to ease up on sanc-

tions on Japan’s Alaskan bottomﬁsh
operations. That decision released an
allocation of some 37,000 metric tons of
Alaskan groundﬁsh to sustain Japanese—
American joint ventures until late March. It
brought the Japanese back to the bargain-
ing table and ended an unofﬁcial freeze in
communications between angry Japanese
fish buyers and U.S. brokers.

As the talks resumed in the ﬁrst week of
February, sources involved in formulating
the U.S. position said two misconceptions
apparently led the United States to unwit-
tingly court a trade war when the talks
began last year.

First, the United States relied too‘heavily
on groundﬁsh to press Japan to negotiate

about salmon. Second, observers say the

Americans alarmed the Japanese by calling
for outright termination of the high-seas
salmon fisheries when the talks began,
overlooking the formidable clout of these
high-seas fisheries,‘ which employ some
50,000 Japanese ﬁshermen and 200,000
associated workers.

“We overestimated the importance of
groundﬁsh relative to the salmon ﬁshery in
Japan, and we underestimated the will-
ingness of the Japanese to really hang tough
and stick it to us on a variety of products,”
says Rod Moore, staff aide to Alaska Con-
gressman Don Young. Last winter, Young
and other Alaska lawmakers embraced the
cause of western Alaska salmon fishermen
and'called for cuts in Japan’s groundﬁsh

 

Pacific Editor

In early February, the Americans and Japanese were heading bow to bow at ram-
ming speed on the matter of high-seas salmon catches, and both sides were ﬂying pen-
nants of self-righteousness. Though government and industry negotiators found a
tentative, minor compromise to forestall the collision, we are left with a foul air of
misunderstanding and the certainty that we’re not through with this one yet.

The discussions smacked of hidden agendas and unrelated internal politics, but
the surface shots went like this:

The Americans told the Japanese to stop catching a million North American
salmon a year offshore; the Japanese told the Americans they wouldn’t stop catching
American salmon offshore because the American fish are mixed with their 30 million

Russian and Japanese salmon, and the fishery is- legal under earlier treaties; the.

Americans told the Japanese that this refusal would result in the island nation’s
groundfish allocation being withheld, even though the amount of North American
salmon Japan takes is negligible, considering that the Americans and Canadians catch
about 150 million salmon a year; the Japanese said they would stop buying ground-
fish offshore in joint ventures with more than 50 American trawlers; the Americans
said, “No problem; a lot of- us want you out of our waters anyway”; the Japanese
said, “Fine, but if you withhold our allocation, we won’t buy the American-caught
salmon we now buy, worth $650 million annually”; the Americans said, “We don’t
think your markets can stand the loss, and furthermore, since we control the waters
around the Aleutian Chain, which extends right into your backyard, we’ll set up a
ﬁshery in our ZOO-mile zone around Attu and start taking Japanese and Russian
salmon away from you.”

This brand of retaliatory diplomacy 1s limited, of course, by the magnitude of the
threats each side is willing to consider carrying out. In the end, the absurdity of
negotiating with ultimatums at ramming speed reveals itself. As one veteran Paciﬁc
hand put it, “Both sides got so far out on their respective limbs that they lost sight of
the tree. ’ ’

 

 

allocations unless Japan agreed to curb
salmon interceptions.

But when the Japanese reacted to the
groundfish cut with angry threats of em-
bargoes on U.S. seafood, American of-
ﬁcials began rethinking their bargaining
strategy.

Japan reacted with unaccustomed
forcefulness in late December when the
United States withheld all but 10,000 tons
of the island nation’s 1986 bottomﬁsh
allocation in the U.S. zone. Japanese
ﬁshing leaders and lawmakers demanded
trade reprisals. Powerful fishing associa-
tions withheld permits for Japanese joint-
venture firms to open their season with '
U.S. ﬁshermen, jeopardizing some $90
million of anticipated JV ﬁsh purchases in
1986.

Bills appeared in the Diet (Japan’s parlia-
ment) to embargo U.S. salmon and other
seafood. A warning shot went out as
disgruntled Japanese fish brokers slapped a
freeze on day-to-day communications with
their U.S. contacts; American salmon and
groundﬁsh marketers suddenly had trouble
getting responses to their phone calls and
Telexes ‘in Tokyo. American experts on
Japanese ﬁsh trade suggested Japan’s ﬁsh
buyers ‘were angry enough to institute an
embargo even if the Diet should shy from
the idea.

“We didn’t anticipate that the Japanese

' would retaliate the way they did,” admits

Doug Humes, an aide to Alaska Sen. Frank
Murkowski, who supports allocation cur-
tailments as a means to force Japan to
negotiate about salmon. “We still believe
that allocations should be withheld. —-
that’s the way to get some progress on
salmon.” _ D

Greenpeace Urges
End of Gill Nets

Catfihg gill nets "curtains of death." Greenpgace is
campaigning with international commercial fishing
organizations to urge Japan, Taiwan and South Korea
to phase out their use of the nets in the North Paciﬁc.

Gill nets are monofilament-webbed nets. hung
vertically in the ocean with floats at the top and
weights at the bottom. The nets trap and kill any
marine animal, fish or ‘bird that becomes entangled In
a news package sent to media outlets across the United
States. Greenpeace makes the following claims about
gill nets in the North Pacific:

-—Gill nets are the largest cause of marine mammal
death in the North Pacific today. citing a National
Marine Fisheries Service estimate that Japan’s salmon
drift net fleets alone incidentally kill about 5.000 Dall's
porpoises per year.

-—.lapanese. Taiwan and South Korean gill nets kill
hundreds of thousands of sea birds and lesser numbers
of turtles.

-—.lapanese gill nets are a factor in the decline Of
US. and Canadian salmon stocks, which are intercept-
ed at sea by Japanese gill nets. Greenpeace adds:
"Wasteful drift nets are estimated to lose one adult
salmon for every three landed."

~Japan. Taiwan and South Korea have a combined
total of more than 700 ships that use drift nets to catch
squid. In addition. Japan operates 381 gill net vessels
that fish for salmon. including a l72-ship fleet in the
Bering Sea.

—~ln the mid-Pacific, Japan. and Taiwan operate
more than 600 additional drift ‘net vessels fishing for
marlin, sailﬁsh and other species. The two countries.
during billf1sh seasons, set out over 20,000 miles of nets
dail '.

3The squid and billfish fisheries are not regulated
by any international fisheries agreemenL

«rLost or abandoned gill nets, aimlessly adrift in the
North Pacific, annually kill thousands of seals.

e subject matter of the case,
Baidrige vs. American Cetacean Soci-
etﬁﬁs whaling. The issue is whether
th U S can be a reliable partner in
trgtfy negotiations. Consider: The In-
tetgitional Whaling Commission in
was said all whaling must end this
yetir'l’ Japan and several other whaling
countries objected, which meant they
wéreh’ t bound. Congress passed a law
thggjlnstructed the executive to cut in
half the U. S. fishing rights of any
country that didn’t comply with the
Ivgé‘s ban on whaling. In 1984, Com-
mgifCe Secretary Baldrige signed an
eWtiVe agreement with Japan,
wgirth pledged to stop all whaling by
19“ "250 long as the U. S. imposed no

' ions in the meantime.

‘w Congress and a group of envi-

entalists want to invalidate the

tive agreement and apply the

V , ions against Japan. Under the
' ’ the commerce secretary is to ap-
prlgqanctions if he determines a coun-
t 3 activities “diminish the effec-
tiveness” of the international whaling
agreement. Here, the executive cut a
deal that Japan would submit to the
otherwise powerless IWC in exchange
for a two-year delay in order to ap-

pease its domestic fishing lobby. The]

Commerce Department says the bill
in question would needlessly impose
“drastic economic sanctions upon an

important foreign ally culturally and
historically committed to whaling.”

This kind of give-and-take between
countries is precisely why' the Consti-
tution gives the treaty-making power
exclusively to the president. Hamilton
explained in the Federalist Papers
that only the executive had “accurate
and comprehensive knowledge of for-
eign politics; a steady and systematic
adherence to the same views; a nice
and uniform sensibility to national
character; decision, secrecy and dis-
patch.” Once Congress gets involved,
alL the special interests (Greenpeace
and Friends of the Earth are named
plaintiffs) get into the act, with bi-
zarre results. Here, economic sanc-
tions would be,applied to pressure the
Japanese maybe, eventually, to stop
whalinguthe very accomplishment of-
-the executive agreement.

There’s precedent to dismiss the
whaling case out of hand. The leading
foreign-affairs pronouncement by the
Supreme Court is the 1936 case of U.’S.
vs. CurtissWright Export, upholding
an arms-export ban by FDR. The
court said there was a “very delicate,
plenary and exclusive power of the
president as the sole organ of the fed-.
eral government in the field of inter-
national relations.” More recently,
President Carter unilaterally froze
Iranian assets arguing, f “Curtiss-
Wright, so I’m right.”'Note that if the
War Powers Resolution is ever chal-
lenged, the same reasoning says Con-
gress has no power to force the presi-
dent to recall troops.

The whaling case gives the high
court a chance to emphasize the
unique power of the president in for-
eign affairs. By working out an agree-
vmentto save the whales, the execu-
tive showed why the US must speak
with one voice to other countries.
While this is important when dealing
with allies like Japan, it is crucial
when dealing with enemies.

The interior Department accepted bids on
the leases in January but was enjomed
from opening the bids by a federal judge in
Alaska on the ground that the department
may have inadequately weighed the im-
pact of proposed oil development on the
hunting and fishing rights of native Alas-
kans. .

Lawyers had said in January that the
Alaska judge’s decision, if upheld, would
minimally require the Interior Department
to restudy the impact of the Bristol Bay
development, in effect delaying the sale.

! Lawyers on both sides said Friday that
' they expect the appeals court to rule
, within a few weeks.

The lease sale had been scheduled for

' January but was halted by lawsuits filed

by Alaska, Eskimo groups and environ-

. mental organizations. The suits contended
f that oil development not only would inter-
? fere with aboriginal hunting and fishing
rights but might jeopardize Bristol Bay’s
. $1 billion commercial salmon industry.

The Interior Department has estimated

' the Bristol Bay lease sale area contains

about 279 million barrels of oil, giving it

‘ modest potential by Alaska standards. In

court papers, the government says it ex-
pects bids to total about $100 million. In the

The Oceans Are Choking on Plastic Debris

 

To the Editor:

You should be congratulated for
“Net Murder at Sea” (editorial, Feb.
17), which describes the loss of ma-
rine life in the north Pacific Ocean
caused by entanglement in Japanese
drift nets. However, you broached
only the tip of the iceberg of the
plastics-at-sea problem.

Each day the world’s shipping fleet
discards an estimated 450,000 plastic
containers into the sea, and each year
fishing vessels dump more than 52
million pounds of plastic packaging
material and 298 million pounds of
plastic fishing gear. In addition, plas-

tic debris generated by plastic manu- .

facturing plants enters the oceans via
rivers and industrial outfalls.

More than two million sea birds and
100,000 marine mammals die each
year by becoming entangled in or in-
gesting these discarded plastics,
which are ubiquitous and float for
years on the open seas. This loss oc-
curs not only in our waters, but also in
such distant places as the Galapagos
and Marshall Islands. Indeed, scien-
tists believe that plastics may begin
to accumulate near Antarctica and
threaten unique marine life there.

Action by the United States cqtld

Monkey business

 

Bolivia asks for animals back

Washington

Tm; government of Bolivia is demanding
the return of 361 owl and squirrel monk-
eys exported to the United States last
month for use in the development of a
malaria vaccine. The_anima|s. the first of a
lot of (100. were exported under a special
ministerial exemption to Bolivia's existing
ban on the export of faunajand are now
under quarantine in Miami. Last week the
ministerial exemption was annulled and
the rest of the shipment is unlikely to leave
Bolivia.

The animals were imported by World-
wide Primates lnc. ofMiami. run by anim-
al dealer millionaire Matthew Block. and
were to have been distributed to more
than 14 US institutions supporting malaria
research. The animals are not considered
seriously at risk of extinction. although it
is argued that there has been no adequate
census of the animals and that it would be
possible to use captive-bred animals for
the research.

The affair led to frank disagreement be-
tween the State Department. which has
supported Bolivia‘s efforts-to reduce illeg-
al animal exports. and the US Agency for
International Development (AID). which
coordinates malaria research. Two years
ago. Bolivia banned the export of all fauna
(although enforcement is generally consi-
dered lax) and so the State Department
declared its opposition to the deal. Bolivia
is also a signatory of CITES. the Conven—
tion on International Trade -in En-
dangered Species.

Squirrel monkeys and owl monkeys
(Saimiri scioureous bolii'icnsis and Actus
trivirgamsson) are listed in Appendix 3 of
CITES. which means they are considered

threatened but not “endangered". US
laws permit the import of Appendix 2
animals with proper documentation. ,

The proposal to export the animals to
the United States was apparently made by
Bolivian scientists at a conference on
malaria in Florida last autumn. and the
Bolivian government agreed. State De-
partment officials were concerned about
the setting of a precedent. but backed
down when it became clear thataWorld-
wide had secured a government exemp-
tion. Dr Kenneth Bart ofAlD's health
office later criticized the State Depart—
ment for "inappropriately" describing the
species as “endangered".

There has been a worldwide resurgence
of malaria in the past few years. primarily
because of the drug resistance of malaria
parasites and insecticide resistance in the
mosquito \ectors. The disease causes 2—3
million deaths each year. mainly among
young children. There has been significant

 

'progress towards vaccines in recent years

thanks to genetic engineering .but the dif-
ficulty of obtaining non— —human primates
for testing (required by the Food and
Drug Administration before human
volunteer trials can begin) has become a
major bottleneck. AID has supported a
network of laboratories working towards
a vaccine for 15 years.

The Bolivian Embassy in Washington
will offer no explanation for the exemp-
tion or its withdrawal; AID officials blame
hysteria in the Bolivian press and political
machinations by opponents of the govern—
ment.

En vironmen ralis #5

Star-Bulletin Writer

Two environmental groups have charged
in a lawsuit that the federal agency respon-
sible for protecting Hawaiian monk seals
has failed to take certain steps to safe-
guard the endan ered animals.

Green eace nternatlonal, the Sierra
Club an Greenpeace members Sharon Sue
Difloure White and Vivian Boe filed the
lawsuit esterday in the US. District Court
in Hono ulu.

They claim the National Marine Fisheries
Service (NMFS) is violating two federal
laws because it hasn’t designated critical
habitat for Hawaiian monk seals in the
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

Critical habitat includes major land and
water areas used by the seals for feeding
and breeding.

The fisheries service is responsible under
the Endangered Species Act and Marine
Mammal Protection Act for rotecting and
buildin up the declining se population.

The arine Mammal Commission ap-
pointed by Congress urged NMFS 10 years
ago to designate critical habitat for the

THE FISHERIES service’s Hawaiian
Monk Seal Recovery Team recommended
twice in the t six years that the critical
habitat be esignated to a de th of 20
fathoms — 120 eet — around orthwest-
ern Hawaiian Island beaches.

The recommendation was chan ed to 10
fathoms —— 60 feet -— at the NM regional
office at Terminal Island, Calif, and no
further action has been taken.

“It has been held up in various levels of
review,” an official at the California office
told the Star-Bulletin in a telephone inter-
view yesterday.

White described the delay as “an uncon-
scionable example of bureaucratic foot-
dragging over something their own scien-
tists say is imperative for the.recovery of
the species.” ’

Commerce Malcolm Baldrige, Anthony S.

director, Southwest Region, NMFS, and
Doyle Gates, administrator of the Western
Pacific Pro ram Office for NMFS. .

Gates sai he can’t comment on the suit,
but he acknowledged that the critical habi-
tat designation has. been a “contentious
issue...The real problem is a misunderstand
ing as to what critical habitat really does.”

authority to protect the seals’ environment
from construction or projects planned by
other federal agencies. e said.

BUT FEDERAL agencies already are re-
quired to consult with NMFS about any
construction or changes of areas inhabited
by endangered species, he said.

NMFS scientist William Gilmartin, the
recovery team leader, said the habitat
designation is a high priority of the team
because it defines boundaries within which
the monk seal must be considered. “With-
out that, it’s a little more loose.”

He said, “We know the animals are div-

was the recovery team’s opinion that if we
want to try to recover the species. we
should try to protect the feedin habitat as
well as t e pupping habitat an nearshore
areas where they learn to feed."

The team recommended the critical habi-
tat in 1980, and in December 1984, Gilmar-
tin said, “we restated our position and for-
mally submitted it to the regional direc-
tor.”

Public hearings were held here in
January and the reposal was sent in A ril
to the Southwest egion office at Term nal
Island, Gates said.

However, he said some Western Pacific
Fisheries Council members and some state
agencies “are not enamored” by any desig-
nation of a critical seal habitat.

THE REGIONAL OFFICE subsequently
designated 10 fathoms for the habitat. The
prcaposal went to Washington last August
an was returned to the regional office in
September for some adjustments.

Gates didn’t know the status of the mat-
ter yesterday. “We were. not a party to
actions after it left my office,” he said.

The ,critical habitat recommendation was-

sent to the NMFS director in Washington

Wednesday, said Jim Lecky, protective ‘

species Cprofgram leader at the regional of-
fice in ali ornia.

He said it must clear several levels at
NCAA and the Commerce Department and
then the budget office before it takes ef-
fect.

Lecky said the delay the past year was
due to the review recess: “Everybody
wants to put their litt e bit in and ask for
different information."

Asked why the regional office is overrid-
ing recommendations of the NMFS-ap-
pointed recovery team to protect seas
down to lZO—foot depths, Lecky said:

”We felt the information available sup-
ports 10 fathoms...lt's a matter of interpre-
tation of some information and...what the
law says should be designated as critical
habitat."

Park Service Ban on Hunting, Trapping Upheld

A federal district judge yesterday
upheld National Park Service reg-
ulations that prohibit hunting and
trapping in national parks and rec-
reation areas except where specif-
ically permitted by Congress.

The regulations, issued in 1983
and in effect for more than a year,
closed to hunters four national rec-
reation areas where hunting tradi-
tionally had been allowed. In addi-
tion, the park service rules closed
to trappers 11 recreation areas, in-

cluding the Assateague Island Na—
tional Seashore.

The National Riﬂe Association
filed suit in April 1984 to block the
regulations, contending that the
park service could open to hunting
and trapping any parks or recre-
ation areas where the activities
were not specifically prohibited.

In upholding the regulations, US.
District Judge Thomas P. Jackson
said the NRA will have to go to
Congress, rather than taking its ar-

gument to the courts, if it wants to
change the policy.

National Park Service spokesman
George Berklacey said the ruling
“reaffirms the intent of Congress”
and will be especially beneficial to
wildlife sanctuaries. Of the 44 na-
tional recreation areas, hunting is
allowed at 32 locations and trapping
at 10 locations, Berklacey said.

David Warner of the NRA said he
expects the decision to be appealed.

New Zealand’Says France Blocks Food Trade

By PAUL LEWIS
Special to The New York Times

PARIS, March 2 -— Prime Minister
'David Lange of New Zealand has ac-
cused France of blocking food imports
from New Zealand in a bid to obtain the
release of two French secret agents
jailed for their role in sinking the
Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior.

In an interview last week with Le
Monde, Mr. ‘Lange said France was
“exercising commercial pressure” on
New Zealand by erecting new barriers
against imports of New Zealand goods.

He described the action as “a very
strange way of trying to obtain the lib-
erty of the two guilty people.” ..

The French Government had no com-
ment on the allegation. But'New Zea-
land diplomatic sources here said the
French authorities recently started
turning away shipments of New Zea-
land meat, fruit and fish, either refus-
ing import licenses without explana-
tion or describing the goods as in-
correctly labeled.

No Satisfactory Explanation

The sources said complaints to the
French Foreign Ministry and the Agri-
culture Ministry had brought no satis-
factory explanation.

French imports of New Zealand food
haVe grown from $106 million in 1982 to
$214 million last year.

The two French secret agents, Maj.
Alain Mafart and Capt. Dominique
Prieur, were each sentenced to 10
years’ imprisonment for manslaughter
in the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior.
The vessel was blown up in Auckland
Harbor last July while preparing to in-
terrupt French nuclear tests on the Pa.
cific atoll of Mururoa. A photographer
for Greenpeace, an international envi-
ronmentalist and antinuclear group,
was killed by the blast.

Disclosures about the role of the
French secret service in the operation
created a political scandal and led to
the resignation of Charles Hernu as De~
tense Minister, although he denied hav-
ing ordered the ship’s destruction.

In the interview with Le Monde, Mr.
Lange stressed that the two agents had
been convicted o “a particularly grave
crime" and said the sinking of the

 

Rainbow Warrior could be compared to
“an act of international terrorism car-
ried out by a state for political ends.”

' Obligation to an Ally

For several years the Government in
Tokyo has vigorously endorsed —— even
agreed to finance —- the 920—apartment
complex for American families sta-

tioned at the Yokosuka Naval Base four
miles to the east. The argument has
been that it is Japan’s obligation to a
valued ally, and this year’s defense
budget sets aside $8.9 million for land
surveys and other preliminary work.

' By a 56.5 percent majority —- 15,887
to 12,223 — Zushi voters approved an
immediate recall of their Municipal

legislature to be held before April 11.

Resisting anti-housing forces, includ-v

of the assembly had insisted that it did

An Unusual Revolt

Opponents, in seeking to oust their

autonomy. While the idea is hardly new
in Japan, it is unusual for Japanese to
use the ballot box to stage what
amounts to an insurgency against
higher authority. »

Almost as unusual is the fact that th
campaign was dominated by house-
wives, a group whose opinions are not
often diligently sought in male-domi-
nated Japanese politics.

Groups of women here celebrated
victory today with a gesture that has
taken on worldwide meaning. They
raised their hands, thumbs and forefin-
gers forming an L. It was the symbol of

of the global militarization ,its ab-

311E WALL STREET JOURNAL WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, 1986

Former Rep. Conable Brings Mastery
01‘ Trade, Politics to" n or iu Jank Post

 

By ALBERT R. HUNT
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

WASHINGTON —House Speaker “Tip"
O’Neill, an Irish Catholic graduate of Bos-
ton College and street-smart Democrat,
and George Bush, a Protestant son of Yale
and patrician Republican, have many dif-
ferences, but they share one political pref-
erence: The GOP congressman they have
respected the most is Barber B. Conable.

The 63-year—old Mr. Conable, who re-
tired last year after 20 years in the House,
last week was picked by President Reagan
to be the new president of the World Bank.
A household name inside Washington’s
Beltway, Mr. Conable is unknown to many
Third World countries who are profoundly
, affected by the bank’s $50 billion lending
program.

Mr. Conable, the most prominent Re
publican on the powerful House Ways and
Means Committee . .
for more than a dec-
ade, possesses a
keen political sense
and an extraordi-
nary mastery of
complicated tax and
trade issues. Sup-
porters expect he
will bring these
same qualities to the
World Bank, which
many believe has
drifted under its cur
rent president, A.W.

Clausen.

Robert Hormats, vice president of Gold-
man, Sachs & Co. and a former top inter-
national economic official in several ad-
ministrations, predicts: “Conable will do

in the development area what Jacques de
Larosiere did in debt restructuring and
economic stability.” Mr. de Larosiere,
managing director of the International Mo-
netary Fund, thrust the once-passive IMF

into the center of efforts to deal with world .

debt problems.

Critics, notably some supply-side con-
servatives, complain that Mr. Conable is a
conventional fiscal conservative more
comfortable with budgetbalancing auster-
ity than with the idea of growth driven by
tax cuts. They predict he will quickly be-
come a captive of the World Bank’s huge
bureaucracy.

“Conable is the one guy you can count
on not to clean up the blireaucracy there,”
says newspaper columnist Robert Novak,
an ardent advocate of supply-side econom-
1cs.

Question of Independence

Others question whether Mr. Conable
will be able to resist pressures from the
Reagan administration and remain inde-
pendent as head of the 149- nation institu-
tion. (His appointment must be approved
by World Bank members, but those nations
traditionally have endorsed the U.S.’s nom-
inee.) Although he never liked Richard
Nixon personally, for example, he didn’t
break with the scandal-ridden former pres-
ident politically until just before the Water-
gate affair forced Mr. Nixon to resign.

Mr. Conable is considered unlikely to
lead the World Bank in any radical or bold
new directions. That isn‘t his style. “I’m a
raging incrementalist,” he says.

But this upstate New York lawyer’s
wide-ranging intellect makes it doubtful
that he will be a conventional champion of
the status quo, either.

THE NEW YORK TIMES, SATURDAY, MARCH 15.1986

Banking on Barber Conable

“Barber has an unusually capacious
mind," says congressional scholar Richard

Fenno of the University of Rochester,
which is in the heart of the congressional
district Mr. Conable represented.

Clearly, directing the bank, whose bu-
reaucracy has swelled to 7,000 employees,
will test that intellect. The bank, which un-
til recently has lent primarily for develop-
ment projects such as dams and highways,
has been criticized for lacking leadership
in dealing with the broader international
debt problem. US. Treasury Secretary
James Baker wants to revamp the institu-
tion to give it a wider role in helping
debtor countries.

Mr. Conable never has managed any.
thing larger than a congressional office,
and he has no development-banking expe-
rience. But the World Bank job is a natural
outgrowth of his legislative specialties. A
free-trade champion, he spent considerable
time in Congress trying to fend off protec-
tionist steps and encourage international
economic cooperation.

On tax matters, to the dismay of some
supply- -siders, he wasn’t an ideologue. He
does believe strongly in tax incentives to
promote growth, but he also advocates pre-
serving as broad a tax base as possible.
These are views he undoubtedly will try to
impress upon developing countries.

Mr. Conable will bring considerable po-
litical skills to such tasks. In Congress, he
frequently urged fellow lawmakers to
avoid succumbing to the “passions of the
moment,” and few legislators commanded
as much respect on both sides of the aisle.
This will give him a critical edge with his
former colleagues—many of whom, in the
current Gramm-Rudman deficit-cutting
climate, aren’t eager to vote for more gen-
erous funding for the World Bank.

“In this atmosphere, Barber may be the
only guy who can deliver congressional
support for the World Bank,” one House
Democrat says.

(over)

‘ President Reagan has chosen well in nominat-
ing Barber Conable to head the World Bank. The
former Republican Congressman from upstate New
York offers high intelligence, political experience
and solid respect on Capitol Hill, where the Treas-
ury must soon seek more funds for the bank. He
lacks a background in development aid, but so did
all his predecessors.

Other member nations must formally elect Mr.
Conable, but all presidents of the bank have been,
by agreement, American. His surprise selection

xgwas particularly welcome in foreign capitals that

had grown worried by the rumored pressure to find
someone who was mainly a salesman for capital—
ism. These concerns were exacerbated by delay;
the Administration decided long ago to name a new
bank president for the five-year term that starts
July 1, but Mr. Conable is left with only four months
to get ready.

The next president has a good chance to lead the
bank in new directions and restore its vigor. At
America’s urging, the bank is being thrust into a
lead role in managing the third world’s great debt
problems. Besides extracting more capital from the

governments of wealthy nations, the next president

must lead the effort to redefine the bank’s role,

reorient its bureaucracy and still retain the confi-‘
dence of investors who buy its bonds.

The Administration bears some responsibility
for the bank’s recent slide. President-elect Reagan
casually assented to President Carter’s choice of
the current president -- A.W. Clausen, a Republi-
can, a banker and a Californian. But the White
House soon treated him as an outsider, recoiled
from multinational aid and reneged on America’s
funding commitment to ‘the bank’s easy-credit af-
filiate, the International Development Association.
Yet the bank has added to its woes. Despite desper-
ate need on three continents, its lending last year
declined by $1 billion from 1984, to $14.3 billion.

That leaves an obvious opportunity. The bank
has unused capacity to expand quickly. Mr. Conable
could do worse than booking an early ﬂight to Mex-
ico City, where the need is critical.

The bank also retains intellectual and cash re—
sources for pioneering research. It led in developing
new farming techniques; comparable effort is
needed for, among other things, p0pulation control,
rain forest preservation and the restoration of
parched land in Africa. Above all, Mr. Conable
faces a chance to raise the consciousness of poor na«
tions and to stir the conscience of the rich.

 




(continued)

Another Test Seen

Despite the initial warm relations be-
tween Mr. Conable and Secretary Baker,
his political skills probably will be tested
in his dealings with the administration too.
Invariably, specialists say, U.S. adminis-
trations pressure the World Bank to use its
lending leverage to change economic poli-

cies in certain countries or to punish U.S; ,

adversaries.

Mr. Conable is likely to tread delicately
in that area, although friends insist he took
the job partly because he thought it would
allow him to be more independent than he
could be in other posts. Despite the Nixon
experience, he has a penchant for indepen-
dence. As a congressman, he never ac-
cepted campaign contributions of more
than $50. to ensure that he wouldn‘t lose
even the appearance of being his own
man.

Mr. Conable’s powers of persuasion will
be needed in dealing with many of the
World Bank’s client states. He won’t talk
about his policy views yet, but associates
are certain he will pressure developing
countries to trim inefficient bureaucracies,
curb subsidies and stimulate foreign in-
vestments, exports and growth.

But as a longtime politician, he will be
likely to understand other countries’ do-
mestic political realities and to avoid pol-
icy confrontations with local officials.

“Many of the issues developing coun-
tries face are half economic and half politi-
cal,” Mr. Hormats says. “In that respect,
Conable really understands their situation
and talks their language.”

Likewise, he almost surely will seek to
reshape and streamline the internal opera-
tions of the bank-but in a gradual, rather
than precipitous, fashion.

One Conable quality that’s likely to sur-
prise his new associates, and perhaps en-
hance his effectiveness, is his eclectic in-
terests. He loves to study history and poli-
tics, speaks Japanese, is an avid collector
of antiques and of American Indian relics,
and is a prolific reciter of poetry ranging
from Omar Khayyam to Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow.

As a congressman, he went home at
least 40 times every year—“Washington is
an easy place to go stale,” he frequently
said. During one such visit, he was the
featured speaker for “Ladies’ Night“ at
the Brockport, N.Y., Lions Club.

The congressman startled'his listeners
that night by asking whether they would
rather hear him report on Washington or
recite poetry. By a narrow margin, the au-
dience voted to hear the Washington re-
port. Mr. Conable reportedly was disap-
pointed at the vote.

Scientists to study
pollution detected
oVer North Pole

By Randolph E. Schmid

Associated Press,

Scientists from five nations are
heading north to study air pollution
over the North Pole, a haze that some
meteorologists think could affect the
climate worldwide.

Smoke, haze and other pollutants
from Europe, the Soviet Union and
probably North America are swept
north into the Arctic in winter, accus
mulating until a significant layer is

visible in March and April, accord-W

ing' to meteorologists.

A; 1983 study found thelayer of
pollution'to be unexpectedly thick,
said Russell C. Schnell of . the Na-
tionalOceanic and Atmospheric Ad-

ministration, which is partiCipating'

in the new study.

The 1983 study, using specially

equipped aircraft, found that the
layer covered an area nearly as large
as North America and extended as
high as 18,000 feet. ,

According to computer models, the
layer of haze in the Arctic begins to
buildup-in late December, peaks in
March and April, and then dissipates.

During its existence, scientists be-
liVe, the layer can cause a warming
of the air‘ by absorbing radiation
from the sun andrby preventing rays
reflected by Earth from escaping
into space.

Scientists are not sure what effect

this warming might have, but early
tests indicate that the haze absorbs a
substantial part of the incoming so-
lar energy at this time of year.
There have been, reports of a re-
duction in the, amount of pack ice in
the Arctic in recent years, but there
is no direct evidence linking it to the

The average surface temperature
of the world has risen slightly in

recent years, probably because of the
so-called greenhouse effect, in
which, scientists speculate, a buildup
of carbon dioxide traps heat in the
atmdsphere. The greenhouse effect
Could account for a melting of some
Arctic ice. ,

That does not mean, however, that

’the haze has no effect. Meteorolo-
gists say its effects could be hidden '

by Other climatic factors. .

Besides the air pollution and its
potential effect on climate, scientists
are concerned with the possible ac-
cumulation of this pollution on the
ice or sea surface when precipitation
eventually clears it from the air in
the summer.

This year’s study begins March 18,

. with participants from the United

States, Canada, Norway, Denmark
and West Germany.

Research planes will collect air
samples within the haze layer itself,
and instruments on the ground will
monitor the air from bases along the
fringe of the Arctic, in Alaska, Can-7
ada and on the island of Svalbard,
north of Scandinavia.

The research planes will fly from
bases in Anchorage, Alaska; Thule,
Greenland, and Ny Alesund, Sval-
bard. '

The 1983 study showed that some
of this pollution originated in Eu‘
rOpe and Asia, Schnell said, but sci-
entists are not certain whether
North America also was a source.

If it was, he said, the most reason-
able route was an airﬂow northbe-
tween Greenland and Canada. In this
year’s study, the aircraft flying from
Greenland will concentrate on that
area.

In the 1983 study, the haze of soot
and other pollutants made the air
and ground appear broWnish orange,
Schnell said.

Recklessness and deceit in

Britain’s nuclear industry

91 Robert c. Conn
Britain’s long-term management of its
atomic programs is an international

Its Sellaﬁeld reactor fuel reprocessing
plant is the world’s worst radioactive pol-
luter of the sea, even when running nor-
mally. It also has had a continuing series
of accidents and leaks. .1

In at least one serious case, responsible
ofﬁcials lied about the extent of the leak
to the goverrunent’s own radiological
safety team. And in Australia, Britain
conducted weapons tests with culpable
disregard for public safety. Their radioac-
tive residue is an environmental menace
to this day.

Dodlcatod workers, poor loaders

These are not exaggerated accusations
of environmental activists. They’re the
result of careful scientiﬁc and engineer—
ing investigation, the conclusion of ofﬁ-
cial commissions, and, in one case, the
verdict of a court of law.

For a reporter who has covered Brit-
ain’s civil atomic program since shortly
after its inception, this is a very sad
unfoldment to report. The many ﬁne men
and women working in that program,
whom I have met over the past 34 years,
have shown competence, integrity, and
personal dedication that deserved. better
leadership than they apparently have
been given.

A vignette involving Sellaﬁeld illus—
trates the point.

Formerly known as Windscale, the in-
stallation began as a military production
facility. It reprocessed uranium fuel from
two on-site reactors, extracting pluto—
nium for bombs.

The Ministry of Defense turned
Windscale overjto the United Kingdom
Atomic Energy Authority in the early
19603. Since then, it has reprocessed fuel
from both military plutonium-production
reactors and civilian power plants. Pluto-
nium is stored both for weapons and for
eventual use as fuel in advanced nuclear

power plants. In the 19705, British Nu—
clear F‘uels (BNF) — a government corpo—
ration — took over Windscale.

. BNF runs the now greatly expanded
facility under the name Sellafield,
reprocessing reactor fuel from several
European countries and Japan as well as
from Britain itself.

The complex has discharged mildly ra-
dioactive liquid waste into the Irish Sea
for decades. In 1957 a ﬁre in one of the
military reactors released radioactive io-
dine. Health authorities destroyed 2 mil-
lion liters of possibly contaminated lo-
cally produced milk.

Both the Irish Sea discharges and this

accident were lively topics at the second ,

United Nations “Atoms for Peace” con-
ference held in 1958 at Geneva. A British

convince a skeptical international press J

corps that the discharges were benign and
that any radioactivity from the accident
had been safely contained. .

I later visited him at his laboratory
where he explained, with obvious sincer-
ity, how carefully Britain managed such
hazards. 4

Now, 28 years later, a parliamentary
commission says Britain’s radioactive
waste management has been “amateur—
ish, haphazard, and ad hoc.” It ﬁnds that
the Sellaﬁeld discharges in particular
have made the Irish Sea the most radioac-
tive stretch of water in the world. .

that air pollution crossing the borders
of the two coun ries caused environ-

emissions from smoke stacks of 'power

ed chemically in the atmosphere,
falls to the earth as acidic rain, snow or

industrial sources and motor vehicles
are also a source of acid rain.

Reagan Backs
$5 Billion Plan
On Acid Rain

By ROBERT E. TAYLOR
And JOHN URQUHART
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

WASHINGTON —President Reagan en-
dorsed a five-year, $5 billion plan aimed at
reducing acid rain that calls for building
power plants that demonstrate ways to
burn coal more cleanly.

The program’s cost would be split
evenly with industry. White House spokes-
man Larry Speakes couldn’t say where the
government would find its share of the
money, but he added, “the administration

will seek to provide" it. Currently. Only
$400 million over three years has been ap‘
proved for such a program

The president also endorsed “fully” the
joint report on acid rain by Canadian and
U.S. special envoys. Aside from recom-
mending the clean-coal program, the re
port says that emissions of acidic pollu: '
tants into the air is directly linked to acid
rain, snow or fog. Mr. Reagan hadn’t pre
viously conceded the link. .

The announcement came as Mr. Rea~
gan wound up a two-day meeting with
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada,
who had pressed for actiOn to reduce U. S.
pollutants that are blown into eastern Can-
ada.

. Mr. Mulroney said he was “very en-
couraged” by Mr. Reagan' 5 statement,
which he called “a significant step in the
right direction." But he indicated that Can-
ada- could want more. “By agreeing to
keep acid rain on our agenda, Mr. Presi-
dent. we signal our joint determination to

solve this problem, " he said.

John Kearney, senior vice president of
the Edison Electric Institute, an electric
utility trade group, called the clean coal
burning demonstration program, “ambi-
tious and costly but a sensible way to build
on the U.S. record of pollution control."

Mr. Speakes said the industry may be
required to: pay back the government cash
out of profits, from the demonstration
plants or to put up more than half of the
funding. Such changes would make the
program less appealing to companies than
the 50% grant program envisioned by the
special envoys, and thus could limit appli-
cations. But Mr. Speakes said industry
would be encouraged to participate by the
threat of future tightening of emission con-
trols on power plants.

For now, h,owever the astion is ex
pected to dampen congressional enthusi-
asm for expensive programs that would
force tighter emission controls. '

Environmental groups criticized the

program. David Hawkins of the National
Clean Air Coalition called it “a diversion”
from serious efforts to cut pollution 'and

Acid rain damage
in Midwest proves
especially severe

Dylan!“
sumammmm

 

The Midwest’s acid rain problem may

be as great as the well-publicized prob-'

lems in the Northeast. That’s the conclu-
sion of several researchers who outlined
their ﬁndings at a conference here Friday
and Saturday. It was s nsored by the
National Clean Air (1 and other
groups. Among the findings:

Urban Impact. Acid rain damage to
structures amounts to an estimated
$44.85 for each Chicago resident per
year. In Louisville, $14.63; in Cleveland
$27.97. These estimates are at best edu-
cated guesses, says Frederick Lipfert, a
consultant on leave from the Brookhaven
National Laboratory.

Impact on forests. Damage in the
Ohio River Valley may be more extensive
than anywhere else in the nation, says Dr.

Orie' Loucks, director of the Holcomb Re- -

search Institute.
Impact on Iakaa. Some 12 percent
of the lakes and streams of Michigan’s

Upper Peninsula already have been
damaged by acidiﬁcation, says a senior
research chemist with the Environmental
Protection Agency. And 43 percent of
Upper Midwest lakes are vulnerable. Acid
rain — not leaching from acid in the soil,
as previously thought —- can account for
most of the mercury contamination of
large fish in the Midwest’s acidic lakes.

A primary cause of the acid-rain prob«
lem has long been suspected to be emis-
sions from coal-fired power plants using
high-sulfur coal, although many natural
causes have been established as well.
After over 5,000 studies “the scientists
are telling us that we can’t afford to wait
until we know all the answers,” says Rep.
Gerry Sikorski (D) of Minnesota, who is
working on a bill to address the problem.

The coal industry is resisting sulfur-
emission control programs. On 'lbesday
the National Coal Association will release
a report showing sulfur emissions from-
ooal-ﬂred plants were down 2.2 percent
between 1980 and 1984.

 

(continued)

“a very wasteful way to do a very small ,.
job.” He said that no more than $100 mil-
lion is needed to prove clean-coal technolo-
gres.

Although Senate Environment Commit-
tee Chairman Robert Stafford (R‘.. Vt.)
agreed that the program is “way too
small,” he said the president’s admission
that acid rain is a problem will help to
pass tough emission restrictions. Rep.
Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), a strong
House advocate of acid rain controls,
doubted the president’s program can win
congressional approval, an aide said.

BILL DUE IN SENATE

 

' T0 CURB ACID RAIN I

 

Bipartisan Group of Sponsors
Says Sweeping Plan Will
Cost $6 Billion a Year

 

By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. ‘

Special to The New York Times

WASHINGTON, March 17 — A
sweeping new legislative initiative to
curb acid rain at an estimated cost of $6
billion a year was announced today by
the chairman and other key mem

Works Committee.

The bill: which Senator Robert T. ‘

Stafford, chairman of the committee,
described as “a turning point” in the
long-running debate on acid rain, is to
be formally introduced Tuesday as
President Reagan meets with Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada to
discuss what has become a contentious
issue between the two countries.
“The case against air pollution gen-
erally and acid rain in particular is
becoming clear and clearer every-

 

where in the world,” Mr. Stafford, a

ers ,
of the Senate Environment and, Public '

 

Vermont Republican, said at a news
conference. “Lakes and forests are
dying, buildings are being destroyed
and uman health is at risk.”

Unlike earlier proposals to regulate
electric power plants, the new legisla-
tion covers cars and trucks as well and
would limit a variety of air pollutants,
rather than just one or two. It would
also apply to the entire country, .not
just the 31 states east of the Mississippi
River or bordering it.

The bill would require that the Presi-
dent engage in treaty negotiations with
Canada and Mexico on acid rain and
would impose an environmental tariff
on goods impbrted from countries ,
whose pollution controls are less strin-
gent than the United States.

The bill is almost certain to be op-
posed by the Reagan Administration
and in various sections of the country,
such as the Middle West, where the rise
in utility bills would be greatest.

But the sponsors, who also include
Senators John H. Chafee, Republican
of Rhode Island, and George J. Mitch—
ell, Democrat of Maine, the ranking 1
members of the Subcommittee on En-
vironmental Pollution, said they were
prepared to press it over a long period.

‘ Meanwhile, the White House de-
clined to say whether Mr. Reagan
would endorse a report delivered in
January by two special envoys he and
Mr. Mulroney appointed a year ago to
study acid rain.

The envoys, Drew Lewis and William:
Davis, recommended a five-year, $5
billion program to develop ways to
burn coal more cleanly. The costs
would be shared by the Federal Gov-

 

 

ernment and; by industry.

A Only California Condor Egg
In Wild Is Found Destroyed

"AN DIEGO, March 10 (AP) -—
The only California condor
egg produced in the wild this
season was found destroyed
beneath its nest in a rugged'area of
Xentura County, biologists said‘ to-
ay. “ ‘ ,
. The discovery was another setback
in the effort to sgfvé' the critically en-
dangered bird. 1y five condors are
known to exist in the wild.
Twenty-one condors are in cap-
tivity at the San Diego Wild Animal
Park and the Los Angeles Zoo.

A "team of researchers from the ‘

Condor Research Center in Ventura
had planned to retrieve the egg and

take it to the San Diego Wild Animal . A

Park for artificial incubation.

- But when they arrived at the nest

site, they found the egg in bits and
pieces, said Jesse Grantham, a staff
biologist for the National Audubon
Society at the research center.
Evidence from the scene indicates
the "egg either was devoured by
ravens or accidentally crushed by its
parents. Biologists at the scene said it

appeared the egg shell Was thinner .

than normal and noted that ravens

also were seen flying in thearea.
Mrs Grantham said ravens had

eaten condOr eggs in the past.

Record Crane Migration

AUSTWELL, Tex., March 10 (AP)N

-— A record number or whooping
cranes, an endangered species, are
ready to migrate from Texas to Cana-
da, as the number of those to reach
breeding age has doubled, Wildlife of-
ficials say.

Ninety-four of the cranes have been
counted this winter at the Aransas
National Wildlife Refuge north of '
Corpus, Christi, said Kenneth

‘ Schwindt, assistant manager of the,

refuge. Two others were spotted in'
Brazoria County, he said last week.
The cranes migrate to Texas each
'fall and winter from Wood Buffalo
National Park on the border between
Alberta, Canada, and the Northwest
Territories, wildlife officials say. '
They are expected to make theirg
spring migration back in a few weeks, 1
officials said. ' i
In the 1984-85 migration to Texas, 86
cranes arrived from Canada, but two
died here and’84 made their way back
north. The previous record migration
was 78 in 1980-81.
The main reason for the dramatic

, increases in the last two winters is

that more cranes have matured to
breeding age and paired for nesting,
Mr. Schwindt said. Three years ago,
there were about 17 to 19 nesting
pairs. There are 27 to 28 pairs this
fyear, he said.

There are 16 chicks this year, an-
other record, Mr. Schwindt said. The
number of chicks that arrived in 1984-
85 was 15. ,

Since 1947, when the Federal Insecti-

took effect, the chemical industry and

Congress have maintained that
changes in the law should primarily re-
flect the concerns of farmers, the
major users of pesticides. But in to-

 

tween the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, the principal
industry trade group, and Cam-
paign for Pesticide Reform, a coalition
of environmental, labor and consumer
groups.

One key provision is intended to up:
grade and accelerate the programs for
determining whether a pesticide
threatens public health or the environ-
ment. The Environmental Protection
Agency, which regulates pesticides,
was directed 14 years ago by Congress
to subject more than 600 major pesti-
jcide ingredients registered before 1972
Ito new batteries of tests.

Congress ordered the retesting pm-
5 gram then because the scientific data
iused to register the ingredients was
considered inadequate by modern
standards. These coo chemicals were
the major active ingredients for about
. 45,000peeticide formulationsfmarketed
by roughly 100 American mainifactur-
ers.

But the E.P.A. has completed evalu-
ating the complete product safety tests
.on just six of the i ients, according
to Nancy Drabble, director of Public
Citizen’s Congress Watch who is also a
leader of the Campaign for Pesticide
Reform. At the current pace, the
agency would not finish the retesting

until well after the turn of the century. ‘

The agency does not dispute that analy-

. ‘Time for Change’

~ In urging the subcommittee to
tighten Federal regulations, he said:
“Times change. It’s time for the agri-
chemicals industry to change.”

The bill considered today was intro-
duced March 11 by Representatives
Berkley Bedell of Iowa, the “subcom-
mittee chairman, and George E.
Brown Jr. of California, both Demo-
crats, and Representative Pat Roberts,
a Republican of Kansas. The legisla-
tion was based on an agreement be-

 

 

Of birds, bogs and jobs

Later this month, the British govern-
ment will get a formal letter of complaint
from the European Commission. The
government, so the Commission thinks,
has broken the EEC directive on birds by
allowing the whisky firm, Scottish Malt
Distillers, permission to 'cut peat on
Duich Moss, on the Scottish island of
Islay. The moss is one of the most
important breeding grounds for the rare
Greenland white-fronted goose. If the
government’s reply does not satisfy the
Commission, it might go to the Europe—
an Court of Justice.

As the Commission posts one letter, it
will be receiving another. The Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds, Brit-
ain’s biggest conservation club, is com-
plaining to the Commission about anoth-
er breach of its birds directive. The
secretary of state for Scotland has re-
fused to overturn a district—council deci-
sion to give planning permission for the
development of a ski slope on Glen-
sheenbang in the middle of a nature
reserve—"even though it is one of the
main habitats for the dotterel, a rare
wading bird.

In both cases the Scottish Office re-
jected advice from the official conserva-
tion watchdog, the NatureConservancy
Council (NCC). In Scotland (though not

in the rest of Britain) a formal objection
from the NCC means that any planning
proposal ends up on the desk of the

NCC has argued that not only is Duich
Moss an excellent example of Britain’s
diminishing tracts of undisturbed wet-
land; it is also not essential to Scottish
Malt Distillers. There is plenty of equally
suitable peat elsewhere on Islay, some of
which they are already digging.

The Scottish Office, has been the
target of both previous complaints 'to
Brussels over Britain’s treatment of
birds—over licences to shoot geese, and
to shoot goosanders and cormorants.
Some conservation groups argue that
because the Scottish Office has such a
wide range of responsibilities, it takes
conservation less seriously than does the
Department of the Environment in Eng—
land and Wales. On Monday, a number
of these groups had a much-postponed
meeting with a junior Scottish Office
minister, Mr Michael Ancram, to tell
him how they felt. The trouble is, some
Scots retort, that Scotland has lots of
birds and bogs, but not enough jobs. If
distillers and ski-slope promoters claim
that the protection of nature threatens
jobs, then their arguments, however ten-
uous, may not be examined too closely.

By DAVID. D. DONIGER
. and DEBORAH A. SHEIMAN

The tragedy of the accident at Union
Carbide’s plant in Bhopal, India, and the
fears aroused by an incident at the Carbide

plant in Institute, W. Va., broughtwelcome ,

public attentionto the chemical industry’s

handling of lethal compounds. Yet in work -

sites across the country, business goes on

as usual, too often with safety rules skifsped .‘
or

or ignored, with inadequate safeguar _
safety training. The Environmental Pro-.
tectibn Agency reports that in the past five

 

years there have been 6,928 accidental

releases of chemicals . in this country,
causing nearly 140 deaths, 4,700 injuries
and the evacuation of 217,000 people.
,Practical, uncomplicated improvements
in plant equipment and safety procedures
could have prevented loss of life and health
in most of these accidents. Example: In
December the Storage tank at Kerr-
McGee’s plant" in Gore, Okla., blew up after
being Overfilled and then heated. The tank
had no alarms or safety relief valves to
relieve excess pressure, according to com;
pany officials. ‘ ‘

That accident, in which one man» died,
shows how crucial it can be to have dual
systems for all important measurements.
The tank was placed on a scale in order to
tell operators how much had been pumped
into it“. But there was. no back-up system to
double-check the reading from the scale. It
apparently malfunctioned and misled the
operators- into Overfilling the tank. All that
was needed was a flow' meter on the
loading lineylike those found on gasOline

pumps. If the flow meter had given a '

different reading than the scale, the opera?

,tors would have known of the overfill

problem in time.

A few Well-designed plants have such
equipment as dual temperature sensors or
pressure gauges on all critical components.
They use advanced telemetry to bring all
the data to a central control room. They use
computers to sense and react to .out-of-
the-ordinary conditions before they be-
come critical. They have back-up treat-
ment devices, such as scrubbers to neutral —

ize vapors or containment tanks to trap
them in the event of a release. ‘

But as we approach the let Century,
most of the chemical industry still uses
l9th-Century concepts of plumbing. Model
plants are the exception, not the rule.

Why does so much of the‘ industry lag
behind on safety measures? The, main
reason appears to be that the pressure of
competition can make safety a secondary
concern; and safety expenditures don’t
contribute to profit. ‘

While almost no businessman will toler-
ate a safety lapse that is guaranteed to hurt
someone, resolve weakens as the danger
becomes less certain and less immediate. If,
you cannot be sure that your competitors
will do the same, it may seem foolish to put
money into safety equipment for something
that may never happen. The more remote
the chance, the more likely the company
will gamble that it can dodge the bullet.

Zia/1» .r“,/": 44% 4..-

But with so many operations nationwide,
the accident record Continues to mount:
7,000 in five years, four to five a day.

This is a' classic case for government
regulation. The government must step in
and mandate that all businesses use the
safety equipment and practices that the
industry leaders have already demonstrat~
ed. By making all firms toe the same mark,

government can remove the economic

disadvantage in being careful and the
advantage in cutting corners. .

This is exactly why. we have a Federal
Aviation Agency to set minimum rules for
safe aircraft design, operation and mainte-
nance, and a Nuclear Regulatory Commis»
sion to do the same for atomic power plants.
Neither agency is perfect, but both indus~
tries are safer than they would be without
oversight. ’

For chemical accidents, however, the
Environmental Protection Agency ’ is no-
where to be seen. Since Bhopal, EPA's only
action has been to publish a list of 402
acutely toxic chemicals and advise people
to get out of the Way if poison gas clouds
come rolling across their communities.

EPA has thus far avoided any responsi-
bility for actually preventing accidents-—
something that a high political appointee in
the agency recently called a contradiction
in terms. Another EPA official suggested
that people get used to the fact that
accidents will happen. EPA’s official poli-
cy, announced in June, 1985, “emphasizes
preparing the public to safeguard itself.”
Despite the availability of safety measures,
EPA would have you believe that nothing

can be done by government, and little can .

be done at all, to Stem the continuing toll of
casualties from poison gas leaks.

Just calling something an “aCcident,”
however, does not make it unpredictable ‘or
unpreventable. Accidents have causes, and
causes can be prevented.

EPA should be promoting and requiring
the use of safety measures.

Working Home: Donald P. Hodel
Watt’s Goals at Interior,
But in a Differet Style '

By PHILIP SHABECOFF T _ " ,5, . ::... Wit
Special to The New York Times ? ‘ ' " ‘

WASHINGTON, March 2 .— Before I
banging heads the other day with the [
Chrysler chieftain Lee A. Iacocca, In- ‘
terior Secretary Donald P. Hodel was
one of the more obscure members of
the Reagan Cabinet.

But Mr. Iacocca’s public roars of
outrage at being dismissed as chair-
man of the Statue 'of Liberty.Ellis Is-
land Centennial Commission blew _ . _ .
away Mr. Hodel’s anonymity. No .._-;~‘ ,1
longer is the name of President Rea-
gan’s third Interior Secretary, who
succeeded James G. Watt and Wil-
liam P. Clark, serviceable as a trivia
question.

Mr. Hodel characterizes the la-
cocca incident as a “flash in the pan.”
But he concedes it will make it hard-

 

er, henceforth, for him to work qui- ,
etly. ' - / ‘ ,~
A major reason Mr. Hodel relished
'his semi-invisibility was that it ena-
bled him to go about the business of

carrying out Mr. Reagan’s land and -

resource policies without stirring ex-
cessive attention, anger or opposi-
tion. His policies, he says, are essen-
tially the same as those of Mr. Watt,
but he has been able to avoid the heat
that conservationists kept on Mr.
Watt.

”Right of Groups to Sue to
Defend Member Rights

 

By STUART TAYLOR Jré:
Special to The New York Times '

, WASHINGTON, March 18 —— An un-:
__ , usual coalition of major labor. business
and environmental groups united today

in opposing a Reagan Administration

, request that the Supreme Court re-
; verse years of precedent by limiting or-

ganizations’ access to the courts.
Eight groups, including such fre-
quent adversaries as the United States
Chamber of Commerce and the Amer—
ican Federation of Labor and Congress

of Industrial 0r anizations, urged the '

Court to uphol its previous rulings

. that organizations have legal standing

to sue to defend the rights of their

' members.

They filed- their brief today in re-
sponse to a little—noticed brief last
month in which the Justice Depart-
ment said, “We see no justification for
the anomalous doctrine of representa-
tive standing.”

Calling the doctrine “a creation of

this Court,” Solicitor General Charles

Fried and other department lawyers
said, “We submit that it would be ap-
propriate for the Court to reconsider
the doctrine in light of the practical and

NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, 1986

Today’s brief by the ei t groups
lsaid Mr. Fricd's “ sug-
ggestion” would “serioust impair the
g ability of each of them \to perform its
fessential role of protecting the rights
. and interests of its members in Federal
a court litigation.”

Also signing were the American
§ Medical Association, the National As-
; sociation for the Advancement of Col-
j ored People", the National Association
* of Manufacturers, the Chemical Manu-
facturers Association, the Sierra Club
, and the Alliance for Justice, which is a
I coalition of public interest groups.

. , While the subject of the dispute is
' technical and legalistic, the dispute is

} noteworthy because of the unusual a1;
' liance that filed today’s brief and be.

cause it is rare for the Justice Depart-
, ment to ask the Court to reverse itself.

Impact of Department Proposal

. The Justice Department’s position
would require that challenges to Fed-
eral regulations and many other suits,
which for decades have routinely been
brought by organizations, must be
brought by individuals, or as actions
representing a class of people, or not at
all. . ‘ . - '
Its brief cited several reasons for
. concern that associations might not al-
1 ways adequately represent their mem-
. hers, including insuffiCient resources
or experience, possible conﬂicts be-
tween the interests of the association

and those of its members and “discrep-
ant positions among members. ”

The brief said problems could be,

minimized by requiring that suits to
1, protect the rights of association mem-
‘ bers or other groups of individuals be
brought as class actions.

Class action suits must clear various

procedural obstacles that the Court has
not previously applied to suits by or-

political function as Mr. Watt served
before his abrupt departure; He is a
highly valued and effective Adminis-
tration and Republican Party envoy
and fund-raiser among the energy,
mining-and ranching interests of the
West and in the Conservative wing of
the party. .

Conservationists tend to view Mr.
Hodel as a James Watt in, say,
striped bass clothing. While they
prefer“ his operating style and tend to
view it' as more effective than Mr.
Watt’s, they are not satisfied with his
commitment to the preservation of
public land and resources and worry
that he is eager to turn over those
lands and resources to private inter-
ests. .
“The only way he is different is his
style of operation,” Said Charles
Clusen, vice president for 'conserva-
tion of the Wilderness Society. “He is
low.key and doesn’t make inﬂamma-
tory statements. He is somewhat ac-
cessible. But his policies are similar
if not identical to Jim Watt’s.”

Energy, mining and ranching inter-
ests not only tend to like Mr. Hodel’s
support of many of Mr. Watt’s poli-
cies, they also like Mr. Hodel’s new
style. “We think Don has done a heck
of a lot of improving the image of the
department,” said Ronald A. Michie
li, director of natural resources for
'the National Cattlemen’s Associa-
tion.

He Says Charges Are Same
Mr. Hodel, who is 50 years old and

served as under secretary for Mr.
Watt and then as Secretary of Energy

relations with state and local govern-
ments and develop Indian resources.

As under Mr. Watt,the depart- l

ment’s budget under Mr. Hodel. is
. heavily WW toward its resource
l development functions as opposed to
preservation functions. Echoing a
warning frequently voiced by Mr.
. Watt in his tenure, Mr. Hodel said he
was “gravely concerned that we are
blindfolding America as .to its re
source potential” by closing so much
public land and offshore acreage to
exploration for oil, gas and minerals.

Also as under Mr. Watt, the Interior
Department under Mr. Hodel is op-
posing major new acquisitions for the
National Park system. But where Mr.
Watt called for a moratorium on land
acquistion and attacked past man-
agement 'of the system, Mr. Hodel is
simply justifying deferral of land pur-
chases as a fiscal necessity at the mo-
ment. -

Mr. Hodel also appears to be more
successful than Mr. Watt in pursuing
programs to open the outer continen-
tal shelf to oil and gas development.
Mr. Watt’s efforts to open almost all
of the billion-acre shelf met bitter op~
position and produced, among other
things, a Congressionally mandated
moratorium on drilling in wide areas
off California and New England. Mr.
Hodel, making some mOdfications in
the program, some mostly in the style
of operations, has gotten the more-
torium lifted, at least for the time
being. .

He did, however, incur the wrath of
members of California’s Congres-

analytical difficulties it presents.”

from a tentative agreement for limit-
ing oil and gas activities off their
coast. Until the Iacocca fracas, it was
Mr. Hodel’s only real exposure to the
intense heat of controversy.

Mr. Hodel spends a greatddeal of .
time traveling the West talking to
constituents of the Interior Depart—
ment and speaking at political gath-
erings. ,

According to David Prosper-i, Mr.
Hodel’s chief spokesman, the secre-
tary is the Republican Party’s third

biggest fund-raiser after the Presi-

dent and Vice President. Mr. Hodel
says he intends to spend a good deal
of time ”drawing attention" to Re-
publican candidates for office this
year. '

“If we ever take the West for
granted we can kiss it goodbye,” he
added.

Is Mr. Hodel building a political
base for his own future use? “He has
made it clear that he does not desire
to’ have a career in politics,” Mr.

Prosperi says.

 

lems cited by the Government to sup-
port its attack on the doctrine of associ-
ational standing rarely, if ever, oc-
curred in practice.‘

“The doctrine gives effect to the
members’ legitimate interest in band-
ing together in order to present their
co lective interests more effectively,”
they said. They added that such suits
helped the courts by “consolidating
multiple claims in a single proceeding
which is litigated by an organization
with adequate resources to try the mat-
terrfully, fairly and expertly.”

Benjamin W. Heineman J r., a Wash:
ington lawyer who wrote the brief, said
today that the Justice Department’s
position would “undercut the effective-
ness of voluntary associations” and
make it harder to get major legal
issues with widespread impact defini-
tively resolved.

The eight groups took no position on
the particulars of the case pending be-
fore the Court. lt is a suit against the
Government by the United Automobile
Workers and several of its members,
seeking to establish the eligibility for
special Federal benefits of thousands
of union members who contended they
lost their jobs because of import
competition before 1975.

Environmental Report Polluted Byﬁeology

Council ’s Assessment Distorts In. Order To Suit Reagan Bias Against Regulation

By Edward F lattau

he latest annual report of the

President's Council on Environ-

mental Quality is at its best when
it presents the most recent data regard-
ing the condition of our air, water and
land. It is at its worst when —- unfortu-
nately all too often — it puts an absurd
ideological spin on these statistics (or
ignores them altogether).

The motivation behind this manipula-
tion of facts and figures is to lend some
respectability to the environmental
views that President Reagan still es-
pouses despite their resounding repudi-
ation by the American people. Thus, the
15th annual CEQ report continues to
promote the president's enVironmental
anti-regulation, anti-federal government
approach, an approach that former In-
terior Secretary James Watt and Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency chief
Anne Gorsuch loyally tried to sell with
disastrous results.

President Reagan sets the surrealistic
tone for the report in his message ac-
companying the document. He declares
that the major sources of pollution have
been brought under control, leaving

only ”highly specialized" problems to be -

resolved.

This is so out of touch with reality that
even his minions at the Council on Envi-
ronmental Quality cannot camouflage
the gaff. For example, the CEQ report
notes that the EPA has identified some
19,000 potential hazardous waste dump
sites across the nation and believes
there are many more yet to be discov-
ered. If the president doesn’t consider
this situation to be a major pollution
problem, I shudder to think what it
would take to persuade him that a grave
threat was at hand.

Mr. Reagan also uses his environmen-
tal message to express his concern
about federal regulation's ability to sti-
fle private initiative in the free market-
place. Following his lead, the CEQ re-
port later asserts that"'the tensions
arising from detailed regulatory inter-
ventions into individual lives” has
prompted second thoughts about ex-
tending environmental controls.

President Reagan and his CEQ chorus
still seem unable to distinguish between

unnecessary. time-consuming paper'

work with which the federal govern-

ment sometimes burdens us, and regula-
tions intended to protect our health and
safety. The public is not plagued by this
confusion. Everybody desires the elimi-
nation of excessive red tape.

But the vast majority of Americans
have also indicated they are quite will-
ing to have their activities subject to
environmental regulation. A recent Lou
Harris nationwide poll found that not a
single segment of the population wanted
the environmental laws made less strict.

The only ones besides the Reagan ad-
ministration who seem consistently op-
posed (at least at the outset) to the
strengthening of environmental regula-
tions are entrepreneurs who are inter-
ested in turning a profit regardless of
human costs. Yet the president urges in
his letter that we should rely more on
the private sector to police itself. He
evidently is more trusting of corporate

managers than they are of themselves.

A 1982 Justice Department survey of
retired mid-level corporate executives
discovered that 75 percent of them con-
cluded “industry cannot regulate itself.
and government regulations are neces-
sary to prevent unfair and unethical
practices affecting workers, consumers
and competitors." The executives cited
competitive pressures and greed as the
main driving forces behind illegal acts.

As one progresses deeper into the an-
nual report, the more apparent it be-
comes that CEQ is trying to inflate the
president’s environmental record. CEQ
publishes some government figures it
claims show that the condition of feder-
ally owned rangeland is improving dra-
matically. What it fails, to tell us is that
its analysis is based on rating as favor-
able the enormous amount of rangeland
listed in fair condition, when federal au-
thorities themselves define that acreage
as being in unsatisfactory shape. A real-
istic appraisal of the government's own
data finds more than two-thirds of fed-
erally owned rangeland in unsatisfac-
tory condition.

CEQ maintains that the United States
won a consensus for its views at the
international conference on population
in Mexico City a year and a half ago. In
fact. the Reagan administration‘s dele-
gation was virtually isolated and con-
stantly assailed for urging a de-empha-
sis in family planning and greater
reliance on free-market economics to
regulate population growth.

The annual report ridicules the Car-
ter administration for predicting a do.
mestic oil shortfall that has so far never
materialized. But CEQ then proceeds to
admit our oil production will 'wind down
in another decade and offers little in the
way of a discussion as to what our con-
tingency plan should be.

Finally. the council asserts that our
national parks were adversely affected
by congressionally funded (and Reagan
opposed) “rapid" expansion. Anyone
with even a passing familiarity of the
situation knows that because of civiliza-
tion's aggressive encroachment upon
our parks‘ borders, it’s clear that expan-
sion is not proceeding rapidly enough.

based columnist who writes about en vi-
ronmental matters.

rights of its members.” ,

 




'1 HE NEW YORK TIMES, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 5, 1986

Rising Opposition Stalls Reagan Driveto Develop U.S. Lands

 

By IVER PETERSON
Special to The New York Times

DENVER, March 4 — The Reagan ,

Administration’s effort to sell off as
much public land in the West as possi-
ble and to accelerate development of
natural resources on the rest has been
largely stalled.

The Administration’s drive, reﬂect-

ing an uprising among powerful West-
ern interests against environmental re-
straints that some saw as a “Sagebrush
Rebellion,” has been halted by an up-
welling of environment-'4 3, activism, ac-
cording to political leaders, environ-
mentalists and even some unrecon~
structed partisans of the uprising.
- No industry has watched in more
frustration than the timber interests as
the people in the upper reaches of
many Federal public land bureaus,
often Westerners with pro.develop-
ment backgrounds, have achieved only
occasional success in trying to carry
out the Reagan policy. Efforts to ex-
pand harvests on national forest lands
were sidetracked, blocked in court or
sunk in Congress by the environmental
lobby.

‘Going the Other Way’

“It didn’t happen «~- it simply did not .

happen,” John Benneth of the Amer-
ican Forest Council, an industry group,
said, of the Reagan program. “And
what we’re seeing now is that it is going
the other way.” ~

Much of the opposition to the pro-
,development movement arose among
newcomers to the West, who are resist-
ing the traditional Western view of land
as something put there by God for man
to use and, if necessary, use up.

“The Sagebrush Rebellion is utterly

dead, buried and forgotten,” Gov.
Bruce Babbitt, Democrat of Arizona,
said in an interview. “They did us a
favor back then by raising that old
ghost for one more visitation, and now I
think it’s dead for keeps.”

Reawakening of a Movement

What the rebels did, Governor Bab-
bitt said, was energize a native West-
ern conservation movement that had
lain dormant. That movement contin-
ues to grow, he added, and shows no
sign of fading.

The conservationists can cite a num-
ber of actions in stopping or blunting
plans to develop public lands in the
West:

‘llA public land sale, begun with great
fanfare in June 1982, was snuffed out by
an environmental lawsuit and buried
by the Administration.

‘3] Future sales of timber in national
forests have been cast into doubt by a
recent precedent-setting Forest Serv-
ice decision, forced by environmental-
ists, that ruled against large Federal
road—building subsidies
operators.

‘llLeases to strip-mine Western coal,
. 60 percent of it on Federal land, have
been held up while Congress weighs ob-
jections to the Administration’s early
policy of granting leases at bargain
prices.

‘llNo new Federal water projects, no
dams, reservoirs or canals, haVe come
out of Washington in more than six
years, and existing programs have
been scaled back or altered to reduce
environmental effects.

, Associated Press
Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona
said, “Sagebnish Rebellion is ut-
terly dead, buried and forgotten.”

'1 Federal wildlife officials, prodded
by wildlife groups, are steadily pushing
aside ranchers’ objections and pro-
ceeding with plans to reintroduce griz—
zly bears, wolves and other protected
species into cattle grazing areas.

‘llWestem legislatures, longtime bas-
tions of pro-development sentiment,
are beginning to pass pro-environment
laws that challenge Federal and local
development plans, while candidates
from both parties in the fastest-grow-
ing Western states, among them Ari-
zona, Colorado and Utah, are espousing
environmental positions that were
rarely heard a decade ago.

Taking Over the Fight

Before James G. Watt, Secretary of
the Interior in much of Mr. Reagan’s
first term, began trying to sell off parts
of the Federal Western land holdings
and speed the private use of public
lands, Governor Babbitt said, conser~
vation-minded Westerners were accus-
tomed to letting activists on the East
and West Coasts carry the fight for
public lands.

“With the advent of the Reagan Ad—
ministration and the dismantling of the
Federal trusteeship, there was a spon-
taneous awakening all over the West,”
said the Governor, who has been men-
tioned as a possible contender for the
1988 Democratic. Presidential nomina-
tion. “People began to say, ‘W'e’ve
talked about these issues, but the time
has come to act.’ ”

One of the most tenacious supporters

to timber ; of the pro-development philosophy has

been the Mountain States Legal Foun-
dation, a public interest law group once
headed by Mr. Watt. Connie Brooks,
the foundation’s expert on natural re
sources, credits the Reagan Adminis-

tration with reversing Carter Adminis-

tration policies such as limits on state
water laws. But she criticizes Reagan
aides as unprepared politically and le-
gally for the battles they faced in seek-
ing to expand land use.

“There is no coherent policy on these
issues,” she said. “There is strictly a

moment it is the environmentalists, no

crisis management atmosphere, and
the result is that the ball gets
drOpped.”

As for the development movement,
Mrs. Brooks credits it with at least hav-
ing “called attention” to the griev-
ances of the Western land interests.

Conservationists owe to luck and to
economic forces some of their success
in holding off what they regard as
harmful exploitation. Declines in the
prices of commodities like coal,’oil,
natural gas and timber greatly reduced
the pressure for development just as
the movement was gathering strength.

Nor have the environmentalists al-
ways won. Persistent efforts to reduce
overgrazing of public range lands have
so far been resisted by ranchers and
the Bureau of Land Management. Hun~
'dreds of thousands of acres of public
lands also remain closed ,to the public,
despite strong efforts. by environmen-
talists, becayse access is blocked by
surrounding private lands. And In-
terior Secretary Donald P. Hodel re-
cently Overrode environmentalists to
allow resumption of oil exploration on;
the outer continental shelf.

But in interviews with people on both
sides of the debate over public land

policy, with ranchers and lawyers and .

environmentalists both in the West and
in Washington, a consensus emerges in
which conservationists are pleased, on 1
balance, with the direction of things,
while the old exponents of development ;
feel balked and angry. I

“Nobody’s worrying about us, no- '
body’s worrying about the economic fu-
ture of Wyoming,” said Harry Roberts,
a founder of the Wyoming Heritage
Foundation, an organization of agricul-
tural and energy interests. “The Gov-
ernment listens to whoever is making
the loudest noise, and at the present

question about it. It’s a popular sub-
ject.” ‘

Along with Mrs. Brooks, Mr. Roberts
and other Westerners note that with
Federal land policy made in Congress,
most of the votes affecting the region
are cast by those outside it, principally
Eastemers, who respond to pressure
' by environmentalists without having .to
answer to the voters in the West;

Western eyes are fixed with speCial
interest on the more than half a billion
acres of public land in the West be-'
cause Congress and Federal agencies
are reviewing a wide range of resource
policies. '

Although it tends to surprise non-
Westemers who envision the West as a
rural domain of scattered ranches and
villages, the 11 contiguous Western

 

 

1; ment to urban centers of a larger and .

 

states outside New Mexico are in fact
as highly urbanized as the industrial
Middle West, with 75 percent of the
populace in metropolitan areas.

The economies of these urban cen-
ters are in turn less dependent on natu—
ral resources than they were when cat-
tle, coal and timber were the main-
stays of the Rocky Mountain economy.

.,People knowledgeable in such matters

say new technologies, urban services
and a tourist industry whose interests
are often directly opposed to land
development account for many of the
new jobs and in turn for the increas-

ineg common view of the immense,
' majestic Western landscape as a treas-

ure to be preserved and protected, not
developed and spent.

Conflicting Trends

“It seems to me that there are two
trends,” said Prof. Albert Utton, co-di-
rector of the Natural Resources Law ‘
Center at the University of New Mexico
School of Law. “One is the trend of a
national Government which has tried
to do business as usual in the West, to i
say to the developers, ‘Come and get it, ‘
we are not going to get in your way." "I
Professor Utton said that trend was in
conﬂict “with a longer-term and per— ,.;

haps more powerful trend in the move— 3
more vocal generation of voters, who
are demanding more protection for en?
vironmental amenities.”

The new urban Westerners, says
Mrs. Brooks of the Mountain State
Legal Foundation, “have no idea what
a mine looks like, what a drill bit looks
like, what a sheep operation is like.”

“Most people have never seen any of
that,” she said. “When they think of
beef, they think of Safeway.”

Representative Morris K. Udall, the
Arizona Democrat who is chairman of
the House Interior Committee, which
has jurisdiction over laws on natural
resources and public lands, likes to talk
about the changes he has seen since he
entered politics in 1952.

“When I started out,” he said in an
interview in his Capitol Hill office, “the
common View in the West was that man
is supreme, that the land is there to be
subjugated, you were doing God’s will
when you cut the trees and dammed the
rivers and took the minerals. To a cer-
tain extent it was a good attitude to
have as America moved from Plym-
outh Rock to the Golden Gate. But the
West is settled now, and it has turned
around.”

Mr. Udall recalled the fight to stop
construction of two dams, the Cliff and
Orme, that were planned for the Cen-
tral Arizona Project and that environ-
mentalists viewed as particularly dam-
aging to the land and to wildlife.

The dams “weren’t held'up by rich
New Yorkers —- it was Arizonans them-
selves taking charge who did it,” Mr.

Udall said, adding: “The people who

are ﬂocking into Tucson and Phoenix
are not going to be swayed by the argu-~

Tments of the ranchers and farmers.

The quality of life is much more impor-
tant to them.”

But others, like the supervisors of

Advanced Genetic Sciences Inc., the company that

wants to conduct the Monterey County

experiment and which helped pay for

the Berkeley research, stands by toxic-

... c, ity tests that show “no ill effects in-

E duced by these organisms,” says John

E1, Bedbrook, AGS vice-president and di—

" rector of research. These bacteria, he

adds, are “ubiquitous. You ﬁnd them

everywhere — in the ground, on the
food we eat.”

Even so, the company is having a
hard time ﬁnding supporters here. In
addition to the county supervisors’
complaints, the US Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (EPA) is investigating
the company’s admission that it in-
jected the genetically altered bact ' ,
called Frostban, into fruit and " ‘t
trees outside its laboratories in Oak-
land, Calif. Federal policies require
such tests to be conducted in a
contained facility, such as labs or
greenhouses. The EPA report is ex—

says supervisor Marc Del Piero, noting

he has not received a single letter or phone call in support

“Expediency and commercial consider-
ations came ﬁrst. AGS has the ﬁrst ex-
periment {of this type] outside the lab, and
this comes to light." charges F ET founder
and president Jeremy Rifkin, referring to
the company's admission to the unautho-
rized test. Earlier this month, a federal
court judge in Washington, D.C., denied
Mr. Itil’kin's request for a preliminary
immtion to block AGS's strawberry-
patch test. But the judge scheduled an-
other hearing on the matter for April 7.

Rifkin, who blocked the 1983 UC-
Berkeley bacteria test, argues that in the
long run, biotechnology industries could
have harmful effects on the environment.

Companies always say they can regulate
themselves, but, if anything, this [AGS
Violation] shows that more stringent re-
qmrements are needed," he says.

. The EPA is ﬁrst to admit that its poli-
cnes need reﬁning. For one, the agency
should have inspected the proposed test
Site before issuing an experimental-use
permit, says EPA spokesman Al lleier.

We re learning on the job, taking one
chemical at a time.” he says.

At the heart of the disagreement is the
question of who will regulate the ﬂedg-
ling biotech industry. The EPA. which
regulates pesticides, says the AGS case
falls into its jurisdiction because Frostban
qualiﬁes as a pesticide. In addition, Cali-
fornia, home to one third of the nation's
biotech companies, requires a state per-
mit for the same reason. .

But Monterey County ofﬁcials say
they also should be included in the pro-
cess —— and would require an environ-
mental impact statement before approv-

. ing any tests.

The biotech industry is being regulated
at a much earlier stage in its development
than were other industries, notes Richard
Godown. president of the Industrial Bio—
technology Association ‘in Washington.
But he warns that “if regulations, im-
posed through fear or ignorance. strangle
the industry's ability to conduct tests, the
public suffers as well,” citing recent medi-

. cal advances and crop improvements.

Charles lless, dean of the College of
Agricultural and Environmental Sciences
at the University of California at Davis,
says federal regulations still need to be
ironed out concerning the release of engi-
neered organisms into the environment.
”If the public feels that reliable [govern-
ment] agencies are monitoring the re-
search and studies prior to the release, I
think they would feel a lot better than if
these [tests] were not regulated."

Further, he adds, genetic engineers
need to widen their focus -—- studying the
potential social and economic effects of
their research to assess the “net gain" to
the public.

JIM BARNES and KELLY RIGG

LOBBYING CONTACTS: RESTORING FUNDING FOR CCAMLR RESEARCH
PROGRAM

The Administration has has not requested any funding for
the directed research program for the Southern Ocean proposed
by NOAA to comply with P.L. 98-623. This program must be
funded if the U.S. is going to continue playing a positive,
leadership role in implementation of CCAMLR. Moreover, the
language of Pi“ 98—623 regpires the Commerce Department both
to design and conduct the research program.

The Antarctic Policy Group (APG) strongly supports the
NOAA-NMSF research program, which is budgeted at $3.975
million ig FY 87 and $4.177 million in FY 88. Unless key
congressional committees can be convinced to appropriate
these funds, however, the program is dead.

In order to help reverse this situation, the head of the
APG, Ambassador John Negronponte, has been asked to formally
transmit the recommendations of the APG to key committees. The
APG has submitted a good justification of the research
proposal to the National Security Council (enclosed), which
also could be transmitted to Congress by Ambassador Negroponte.

Because Commerce and NOAA declined to request funding
for the program, they have been unwilling even to transmit
the Program Development Plan (PDP) to the hill. The draft
letter to Baldrige is designed to help liberate the PDP.
Already Negroponte has written to senior NOAA officials about
this. Bruce Manheim, public representative on the CCAMLR
delegation has written a personal letter to Baldrige.

It is desirable for as many environmental organizations
as possible to support the NOAA pr0posal to fund an Antarctic
directed research program, with letters to key committee heads
and lobbying. USE THE MEMC>AND OTHER MATERIALS ENCLOSED TO
WRITE A LETTER ON YOUR ORGANIZATION'S STATIONARY. SEND US A
COPY. We also would like to have other organizations sign on
to the draft ASOC letter to Baldrige regarding the PDP.

There will be hearings on the NOAA budget in early
April, at which Kelly will either testify or submit a written
statement on behalf of The Antarctica Project, Greenpeace and

 




any other organizations that want to be included. We have been
assured of strong support by Rep. Alexander.

ANTARCTICA - PROPOSED RESEARCH BY THE NATIONAL
OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) of the Department of Commerce has proposed a
program of biological, oceanographic and ecological
research to serve U.S. objectives with respect to the
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources (CCAMLR). These objectives relate to implementation
of the Convention's goals of providing for the effective
conservation and management of marine living resources of
the AntarCtic ecosystem. The prOposed research, which
will focus on populations of key Antarctic species as
well as important environmental and ecological processes,
will contribute to the understanding of the effects of
fishing activities in Antarctic waters.

The initial phase of the program, to be
carried out in 1987~88, will consist of (1) stock
assessments of Antarctic fish, krill, seals, birds and
whales, and (2) monitoring of physical oceanographic
conditions for effects on the distribution, abundance,
growth and survival of krill and its predators and prey.
The second phase beginning in 1988—89 austral summer
would involve a continuation of research begun the previous
year in order to develop a time series. Information

gathered continuously over a span of several years is
essential for detection, monitoring and prediction of the
effects of fishing activities on target, dependent and
related populations of Antarctic marine living resources,
as well as the'ecosystem of which they are part.

The research activities prOposed by NCAA, the
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (AMLR) Program, are
directed to the area of the southwest Atlantic
Ocean, Scotia Arc, and Antarctic Peninsula. Special
attention is directed to the vicinity of Bransfield

trait, South Shetland Islands, and the Palmer Archipelago.

. In accordance with President Reagan's directive of
February 5, 1982, agencies other than the National Science
Foundation (NSF) may fund and undertake programs of
scientific research related to Antarctica upon the
recommendation of the Antarctic Policy Group (APG) and
subject to the budgetary review process. The President‘s
directive also provides that such research activity be
coordinated within the framework of the logistic support
of the NSF, which is responsible for the 0.5. national
program in Antarctica. Furthermore, the Antarctic Marine

 




Living Resources Convention Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-623),
signed into law by President Reagan on November 8, 1984,
directs that the ”Secretary of Commerce, in consultation
with the Director of the National Science Foundation,
Secretary of State and the heads of other apprOpriate
federal agencies, shall design and conduct a program of
directed scientific research coordinated with the United

tates Antarctic Program."

Pursuant to the President's directive and P.L. 98—
623, the ARC has reviewed the program development plan
describing the research activities prOposed by NCAA.
The APG‘s review has been directed towards ensuring that
the proposed NOAA program is consistent with U.S. Antarctic
Policy objectives and U.S. obligations under the Antarctic
Treaty, and that it is coordinated with and not disruptive
of the U.S. Antarctic Program managed by NSF.

After reviewing the program development plan
proposed by NOAA, the APG has concluded that such research
would serve overall U.S. Antarctic interests. The APG
believes that the proposed Antarctic Marine Living
Resources Research Program would make a significant
contribution to the overall understanding of the structure
and function of the Antarctic marine ecosystem and could
provide information essential to effective U.S. partici—
pation, within CCAMLR, in the conservation and management
of the marine living resources in ocean areas surrounding
Antarctica. As such, it would contribute significantly
to U.S. Antarctic policy objectives, which include maint-
enance of a lead role in the operation of CCAHLR. In
addition, the ARC notes that the AMLR Program is intended
as a U.S. contribution to joint international research
efforts being planned and undertaken.by member countries
of the CCAMLR in support of the Convention.

Funding for the prOposed AMLR Program remains subject
to the budgetary review process, and thus has yet to be
determined. The APG understands that there may exist the
possibility of retaining the services of the RV Polar
Duke, the charter vessel employed by NSF, to carry out
part of the prOposed research. This might significantly
decrease transit time to and from Antarctica, and reduce
the amount of funding required accordingly. Consequently,
it is suggested that NOAA should.pursue this matter further
with NSF.

BRIEFING DOCUMENT FOR THE AKTARCTIC MARINE LIVING RESOURCES RESEARCH PROGRAM

The 1980 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources (CCAMLR) was negotiated in anticipation of a greatly expanded and
unregulated commercial harvest of krill, the tiny crustacean that forms the
basis of the Antarctic food chain. To date, 21 countries have ratified the
Convention, including the the major fishing nations in the Southern Ocean ~—
the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Poland, and the Soviet Union. The,
United States played a leading role in adoption of this international
agreement and in the development of its innovative "ecosystemewide" approach
to the management of marine living resources in the Southern Ocean. To
implement that management scheme, the Convention established an advisory
Scientific Committee and a regulatory Commission with authority to regulate
fishing and associated activities that may affect krill and other Antarctic
marine species, including baleen whales, seals, penguins and fish.

In order to strengthen the role of the United States on the Convention’s
Scientific Committee and regulatory Commission, Congress enacted the Antarctic
Marine Living Resources Convention Act. That act, which was signed into law
by President Reagan on November 8, 1984, directed the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to develop a comprehensive plan for directed
scientific research of marine living resources in Antarctica. In response to
that mandate, NOAA, in consultation with the National Science Foundation, the
State Department, and other appropriate federal agencies, has prepared a three
year plan for biological, oceanographic and ecological research of
Antarctica’s marine living resources. This research program calls for an
assessment of populations of certain key species of Antarctic marine life and
monitoring of physical oceanographic conditions to ascertain the distribution
and abundance of krill. The information will be essential to predicting and
monitoring the impacts of fishing and associated activities on Antarctica’s
marine life.

To support these activities, NOAA will require $3.975 million for FY 87
and $4.177 million for FY 88. Almost half of these funds are needed for a
180-dav charter of an ice—strengthened vessel to serve as a research platform,
while the remaining monies will be used to support particular scientific
assessments. Despite the very modest amounts needed to fulfill these
important obligations under the Convention and to maintain U.S. leadership in
Antarctica, the Administration’s FY 1987 budget unfortunately does not
include a request for any support whatsoever of its Antarctic Marine Living
Resources Program (AMLR). The AMLR program should be fully supported for the
following reasons:

(1) guppgrt of the AHLR prggggm gill ensure that the United States continues

to play a lead role in_E§QagingMAntarctic magipe livingwpesgyrces. Although
the United States took the initiative in establishing CCAMLR, today it is
falling behind in meeting the Convention’s obligations and may not be able to
exercise as much authority over activities affecting Antarctica’s marine
resources. Indeed, in the absence of support for the AMLR program, the major
fishing nations in Antarctica - the Soviet Union, Japan and the Federal
Republic of Germany ~- may play the lead role in dictating the nature and

extent of fishing activities in Antarctica.

 

 

 




(El Support of the AMLR_program will enable NOAA to_predict, in a
cost-effective mannerJ the effects of fishing and other activities on
important Antarctic marine species. The principal purpose of the AMLR is to
provide U.S. scientists and policy—makers with information that can be used to
regulate the impacts of fishing and associated activities on a variety of
marine species in Antarctica. This objective can be achieved at less than one
half percent of the overall budget request of NCAA ($836,479,000). In light of
over-exploitation of certain fish species by the Soviet Union and
international interest in harvesting other Antarctic marine species, including
krill, funding of the AMLR program is extremely important because adequate
measures to pretent such over-exploitation will be adopted only if they are
supported by available scientific information.

 

 

(3) Support of the AMLR program is a non—partisan issue that will_promote
internatjpnal_§cientific cooperation in Antarctica -— the basis of the
Antargtigﬁfreaty system. When President Reagan signed the Antarctic Marine
living Resources Act, he declared that CCAMLR was of "direct importance to
U.S. Antarctic policy {and} represents an important example of international
cooperation among the consultative parties of the Antarctic Treaty." Indeed,
the l959 Antarctic Treaty, which restricts the use of Antarctica to peaceful
purposes, grew out of international scientific cooperation. Clearly, funding
of the AMLR program would advance the objectives of the Antarctic Treaty.

4) Sppppgtmgfmthe“Aﬂlﬁuprgggam will reverse a declining trend of U-S.
wgientifi§_£esearch in Antarctica. A recent State Department study indicates
that while international participation in Antarctic marine research increased
between l979—84, U.S. effort in Antarctic marine research actually decreased
over that period. Moreover, U.S. scientific dominance in Antarctica will
decline further as the latest members of the Antarctic Treaty system —-
Brazil, lndia and the People’s Republic of China ~— expand their recently
established Antarctic scientific programs. In the absence of adequate funding
of the AHLR program, U.S. scientific and political influence over activities

in Antarctica will continue to be whittled away.

 

 

(53 §ppportuof”thgméﬂlﬂvprgggamuwillgprovide the U.S. with essential
scientific information about the environmental impacts of oil and gas

91:12.1 quaiiemthat -eay_99_<zyr_al_ong_th.e:__£sntar_c_tiC continental shell; In 1981,
the Antarctic Treaty parties recognized growing international interest in
Antarctica’s petroleum potential and called for development of a special
regime to control utilization of the continent’s mineral resources. Since
that time, the parties have prepared a draft "minerals regime" that contains
certain provisions relating to environmentally sound procedures and critical
information requirements for opening areas to oil and gas exploitation.
Although CCAMLR is principally concerned with conservation of marine living
resources, it is clear that a strong AMLR program would allow the United
States to play a key role in scientific decisions regarding the environmental
impacts of oil and gas exploration on marine life within particular areas in
Antarctica.

 

 

 

(6) Support of the Aﬁtﬂ program will make clear to the international
community the U.S. commitment to conservation of Antarctica’s resources. As a
result of recent efforts of the Antarctic Treaty parties to establish a

 

 




minerals regime, there has been much interest from the larger international
community in the regulation and utilization of Antarctica’s resources.

Indeed, at the request of a several countries, the United Nations has been
examining whether the Antarctic Treaty system itself should be revised or
replaced. That analysis will include an evaluation of CCAMLR and whether it is
actually being implemented by its member countries. Clearly, an adequately
funded AMLR program would reflect the position of the United States toward
wise conservation of Antarctica’s marine resources, and would strengthen the
Antarctic Treaty system.

(7) gupport of the AMLRgprogram will enhance and not in any way duplicate the
work of the National Science Foundation in Antarctica. The U.S. Antarctic
program of the NSF is a peer~reyiewed basic research program that does not
support long—term research into particular problems relating to conservation
of Antarctic marine living resources. The Antarctic Policy Group (APG), an
interagency committee with authority to determine whether Antarctic scientific
actiyitics should be carried out by federal agencies other than NSF, fully
supports NOAA’s proposed research program. Specifically, the AFC found that
the AMLR is "coordinated with and not disruptive of the U.S. Antarctic Program
managed by NSF," and is "consistent with U.S. Antarctic policy objectives and
U25. obligations under the Antarctic Treaty."

0 Some nations, like Iceland and the Republic of
Korea, plan to kill whales through bogus‘ ‘scien—

To add to the insult, the Reagan Administration
has approved Japan’s violation of the moratorium
and refused to impose sanctions against Japan
“ mandated by Congress!

The Whale Center will not sit still for this bla-
tant disregard for the lives of whales, and we need
your help to fight this outrage!

The Whale Center has joined with several other
conservation groups in filing a lawsuit against the
Reagan Administration’s Department‘ of Com-
merce, seeking to legally block their agreement to
allow Japan to continue whaling. We have won

of Appeals.

But this effort costs money. Already, our court
costs amount to $200,000! Furthermore, the US
Supreme Court has just announced that they will

for the Whale Center and other conservation
groups to shoulder!

By killing sperm whales in defiance of the IWC
ban, Japan is clearly diminishing the international
agreement’s effectiveness. Instead of sanctioning
Japan, however, the State and Commerce Depart-
ments chose to make the November 1984 deal with
the Japanese, permitting them to go ahead and kill
1200 more scarce sperm whales—in exchange for a

Sea World Orca
Appeal

In another ominous appeal case, Sea World and
the National Marine Fisheries Service have decided to
contest a January 1985 US. District Court decision
which had struck down Sea VVorld’s controversial
permit, which had given them permission to capture
100 orcas, keeping ten in permanent captivity.

The Whale Center and other conservation groups
had contended that the, capture permit granted Sea
World was improper because Sea World and the Na-
tional Marine Fisheries Service had net first con-
ducted an adequate environmental impact study. as
required by federal law. The US. District Court in
Anchorage, Alaska had agreed.

The Whale Center noted that the longevity of areas
in captivity was only an average of 3.1 years, as con-
trasted to the 75-80 years areas are known to live in
the wild. Capture of these wild orcas for display in
aquariums would virtually constitute a death penalty
for the ten orcas decreed by the permit to be kept in
permanent captivity.

February 13, in Seattle, Sea World 5 appeal process
began, with oral arguments being heard by the U. S.
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. An immediate deci-

By Mark Palmer
Whole Center Admin.

This is the first of many—a reg—
ular column to bring members
some inside news about your
Whale Center and our activities
for whales. The Board of Direc-
tors recently moved me into the
position of Administrator for the
Center, and I’m proud to be serv-
ing such a grand and dedicated
organization on behalf of whales
and all marine life!

By way of introduction, I began
working on wildlife conservation
issues back in 1969, when I
entered the Department of
Zoology at the University of Cali-
fornia at Berkeley. My local cam-
pus group, the Endangered
Species of Berkeley (later, we
named it the Endangered Species
Committee of California to denote
the increased scope of operations)
introduced me to a range of wild-
life problems, from Santa Cruz
Long-toed Salamanders and San
Francisco Salt Marsh Harvest
Mice to preserving the vast wilder-
ness lands of Alaska.

I also worked on whale issues,

last whaling station in the United
States (right here in San Francisco
Bay) and helping sponsor Dr.
Roger Payne’s first Bay Area ap-
pearance with his then-
revolutionary talk on the songs of
the humpback whales.

Still later, I joined efforts with
the Sierra Club, holding a variety
of offices, including Chairman of
the Club’s Northern California

 

Conservation Committee, N.C.
Wildlife Committee, Condor Task
Force, and Mono Lake Task
Force. I’ve traveled to various
places giving talks on whales and
endangered species, showing my
slide show at such diverse places as
Yokohama, Japan, and aboard the

‘ aircraft carrier Ranger. I’ve

further written articles on wildlife
for Sierra and Paciﬁc Discovery
magazines, among others. With
the Sierra Club, I also began
leading whalewatching cruises to
the F arallon Islands and Point
Reyes off our own coast.

It was this last experience that
brought me to the Whale Center
as Outings Manager in October
1984, and we’ve since had a won-

’ derful 1985 whalewatching

season.

In my new capacity as Adminis-
trator for the Whale Center, I’ll
be doing some work on conserva-
tion issues, overseeing our mem-
bership, research, and education
programs, handling staff matters,
and doing a bit of fundraising.

Please feel free to write or call
me anytime at the Whale Center
with questions, concerns, prob—
lems, suggestions, etc. etc—any-
thing we can do for you! Our
organization, and our ability to
help save whales and their ocean
habitat, depends on YOU, our
very valued members! Let us
know how we can help.

Next issue, I’ll discuss future
plans for the Whale Center and
some of our existing projects com-

 

The Whale Center extends its
thanks and appreciation to Clif-

Letters to the
Editor ,

Editor’s Note: Last issue, we told
our readers about the grave
dangers facing Amazon River
dolphins. Katharine Watson sent
us the following letter to be re-

printed, and we thank her. Others

who wish to express their concern

should address letters to:

Sr. Sergio Correa da Costa

Ambassador, The Brazilian
Embassy

3006 Massachusetts Avenue, NW

Washington, DC 20008

Dear Sir:

I have recently learned that the
dolphins of the Amazon River are
in danger of extinction. They are

being senselessly slaughtered to fill

the demands of a current fad in
your country. The eyeballs of

these animals are dried and sold to

the public as good luck charms.
This grotesque practice must not
continue to go on. I urge you to
do what you can to put an end to
the collection and subsequent sale
of these “good luck charms.”

Not only is this practice endan—
gering the number of dolphins
which live in the Amazon, but
agricultural pesticides which
pollute parts of the river are poi-
soning them, thus threatening
their existence. As the dams in

your country lower the water level

during the dry season, the
Amazon River dolphins are being
stranded, and also drowned in
nets.

As a result of these practices,
the number of dolphins is

diminishing quickly. I urge you to

take action so that your govern—
ment will formulate a national

1 conservation policy that will pro-
“ ’5' tect these intelligent and sensitive
animals. Would it not be most

regrettable if the day'were to

come that there were no more dol-

phins of the Amazon River—as a

result of the inhumane practices of

your country toward them? The
existence of these dolphins is very
' important since the number of

dolphins which live in rivers such" ”L
as the Amazon, is by'no means if
large. . i A . _

In closing, I ask that youdol} ‘
whatever possible to come to the" ,
aid of these friends of man. I ap. i- 1.5

Spectacular New Marine
Mammals Poster

The Whale Center is proud to. announce the pro-
duction of a beautiful new poster, created in coopera-
tion with the Point Reyes-Farallon Islands National
Marine Sanctuary. This educational work of
art—“The Marine Mammals of the Gulf of the
F arallones”—depicts all marine mammals found in
this rich marine ecosystem. The large cetaceans
(painted by Larry Foster) and the dolphins and pin-
nipeds (painted by Pieter F olkens) are placed over a
map of the Bay Area coastline, giving the poster a feel
for “what lives where”. The borders are filled with
useful information on the marine sanctuary, stran—
dings, whalewatch guidelines, marine mammals,
and on the specific animals. Although this poster will
prove to be an invaluable education tool, it is also cer-
tainly one of the most beautiful marine mammal
posters available. Thanks go to Larry Foster and
Pieter F olkens for their artwork; Bill Prochnow for
design; and Claudia Tyler of the Whale Center and
Nancy Stone of the National Marine Sanctuary for

GRAY WHALES
TO RETURN
FROM BAJA
CALIFORNIA

By Mike Ezekiel

As they do every year, 17,000 to
20,000 gray whales have begun their
voyage from the lagoons such as San Ig-
nacio, Magdelena Bay and Ojo de Liebre
on the west coast of Baja. Beginning in
mid-February, these magnificent 40—
foot whales will commence the 3,000-
4000 mile return migration 'to their sum—
‘ mering grounds in the Artic. Highlights
for California whalewatchers will be the
chance to observe this years’ babies—ex-
uberant 15—foot kids who splash and play
sometimes within yards of the beach—a

NEW
WHALEBUS
UNVEILED!

ur new WhaleBus, a Bay Area

teaching institution since

1977, was unveiled to the de-
light of TV news cameras and children
alike at the Oakland Museum in
January.

The WhaleBus Program, which trav-
els to schools and community events in
Northern California with a hands-on
presentation on whales and ocean ecol-
ogy, visited over 11,600 children last
year. It probably comes as no surprise
that our original VW bus was forced into
retirement, and gave way this year to a
brand new vehicle. (Thanks to the Haas
Fund, Lurie Foundation, Chevron, and
private donors.)

At the unveiling program, coordina-
tor Claudia Tyler gave an overview of
the accomplishments of the innovative
“WhaleBus”. She spoke of the values of
marine education and ended with the

 

message that “schoolchildren are the real
whale experts today!”

F rolicking on the sides of the color-
fully-painted bus are blue whales,
right whale, and dolphins. The design
and artwork were done by well-known
muralist Lou Silva, whose artwork
graces many San Francisco Bay Area
buildings and walls.

Present at the event was the dedicated
classroom of fifth graders from Strand-
wood Elementary School in Pleasant
Hill. Coordinated by teachers Barbara
Loften and Ms. Greene, the students
(who were'visited by the WhaleBus this
fall!) raised money to adopt a whale

' through the Whale Center (see article on

page 8). These eager schoolchildren
were presented with their adoption cer-
tificate and photo of their whales—a
mother they named “spout” and her calf.
The event generated a good deal of
media coverage on TV, radio, and news-
paper. In fact, largely due to that pub-
licity, the WhaleBus Program is
filled up for this school year, through
June 13th. Wow! The WhaleBus
available for summer programs.

Webs of Death: Gill Netting
Along the California Coast

By Mark J. Palmer, -
Whale Center Administrator

The coastline of California is rich in marine life,
supporting a variety of marine mammals and birds,
supported in turn by rich fish life. This abundance is
threatened by several man-caused factors, none as
devastating (and as difficult to resolve) as the in-
creased use of gill nets for fishing.

Gill nets along the California coast are a relatively
new phenomena, being virtually unheard of prior to
the mid-1970’s. Their use has been spurred by the
manufacture of new netting materials for cheap
costs, their use by various other nations in our waters,
and increased markets for fish life previously little
utilized. ‘

But problems almost immediately followed the
widespread use of gill nets in the late 1970’s and early
1980’s. These problems are (1) air-breathing marine
birds and mammals become trapped in the net
meshes and drown, and (2) nets are so efficient that
some people. fear for the health of target and non-
target fisheries.

At the same time,.conservationists concerned with
increased net use along our coast have come up
against real problems—placing restrictions and out-
right bans on net use severely impacts our fishermen-
along the coast. '

While some have called for wiping out commercial
net fishing, most conservation groups, including the
Whale Center, have focused on a more reasonable
approach, working with the commercial fishing in-
dustry to try to come up with restrictions to protect
wildlife while ensuring fishermen are able to con-
tinue fishing. » .

The species of birds and marine mammals most

threatened by gill nets along the California coast are
sea otters, harbor porpoises, harbor seals, and the
common murres. These species suffer dispropor-
tionate lasses because ( 1) they inhabit and feed in the
shallow nearshore waters used by gill net fishermen,
and (2) they tend to be rare enough that any losses
sustained to their populations is cause for alarm.
(Losses of gray whales to nets, while troubling, are
not nearly so devastating to the population of grays,
as an example).

Sea otters Were first recorded to be lost in nets in
1982. Historically, about 16,000 to 18,000 sea otters
were thought to inhabit California waters. Uncon-
trolled harvesting of otters for pelts virtually wiped
out the population by 1911. Between 1911 and the
1970’s, the sea otter population, then protected by in-
ternational treaty, increased an estimated 4% per
year. By 1976, the US. F ish and Wildlife Service
estimated a population of 1,800 (although this num-
ber is controversial). Some shellfish groups and the
state of California even attempted to have the
population restricted at this time, claiming an explo-
sion of sea otters which would over-run the coast. In
fact, from 1976 to 1985, the sea otter population de-
clined. Puzzled researchers, estimating a 1985 popu-
lation “optimistically” at 1,400, began searching for
reasons for the decline. Use of gill nets, primarily set
for halibut, had increased enormously in these
waters. An estimated 80 sea otters per year (6 % of the
population per year) were being drowned in nets.

Several bills in the California legislature have
helped protect sea otters recently. In 1984, Senator
Henry Mello sponsored legislation closing off parts of
Monterey Bay to gill netting, while Senator Ken Mad-
dy'in 1985 successfully passed legislation putting the
entire sea otter range off limits to gill nets. Currently,
losses of sea otters are confined to one area of coast
where otters seem to dive in waters deeper than nor-
mal—legislation contemplated for 1986 will hopeful-
ly place these areas cff limits in the near future.

Common murres, harbor seals and harbor por-
poises have not fared as well, unfortunately. Legisla-
tion by state Senator Milton Marks has placed large

' areas of the northern California coast, from Mon-
terey Bay north to Bodega Bay, off limits to gill nets,
and limits are now in effect to keep the number of
fishermen low. Still, biologists fear these populations
are still being impacted too much by gill nets.

For example, the Department of Fish & Game has
documented the take of harbor porpoises from
Bodega Bay to Half Moon Bay increasing from 4 i
1983, to 15 in 1984, to 28 in 1985! -

 

Whale Center Newsletter "

Harbor porpoises are a secretive cetacean, living 1n
coastal waters worldwide, nowhere abundant. The
numbers, biology, ages, etc. of the harbor porporse
population is virtually unknown. A rough estimate
for the .coast of California is 3,500, according to a
1983 survey. Yet the estimated mortality for harbor
porpoises from 1983 to 1984 was 300, a substantial
number!

At present, it is uncertain just how to avoid this loss
of valuable marine life to nets. Obviously, banning
the use of nets would solve the whole problem. But
the economic impact of such an action on fishermen
would be catastrophic for coastal economies. And,
frankly, the state legislature would never do it.

Conservationists, including myself representing
the Whale Center, have begun addressing this prob-
lem by meeting with commercial fishing industry
representatives to work out some kind of compromise
legislation to help marine life and fishermen alike.

A likely result will be legislation to (1) restrict the
use of gill nets in the ranges of sensitive species yet
further, with the intent of avoiding killing any more
sea otters, porpoises, seals, and birds; (2) providing
funding for monitoring existing fishing operations to
get a better handle on losses of marine birds and
mammals to gill net operations and identify alter-
natives; (3) provide, through loans, permits and other
incentives, alternative experimental fishing gear
which can replace the destructive gill nets with tech-
niques that still harvest fish without endangering
marine birds and mammals. State Assemblyman Sam
Farr has introduced legislation as a “working vehicle”
to try to construct the compromise.

There are still pit-falls, of course. We do not have a -

good idea of where we can cut back on fishing to best
preserve marine birds and mammals—we do not
have enough information of the specific localities or
practices that cause marine bird and mammal losses.
We also must be sensitive to the plight of fishermen—
thr‘owmg them out of Work (asrhas already happened
in some cases with existing restrictions) will only
cause more political and social grief for conservation—
ists and wildlife. Experimental gear may not work.
And the agencies charged with protecting wildlife
and fisheries are facing declining budgets at a time
when we need more funding to conduct research,
monitoring, and enforcement of gill net restrictions.
In the coming months, the Whale Center will be
working with other California conservationists (most
notably, the Point Reyes Bird Observatory, Friends of
the Sea Otter, the Marine Mammal Center, and the
Sierra Club) at resolving these gill net fishing prob-
lems. The Whale Center will pay particular attention
to the plight of the harbor porpoise, seeking restric—
tions that will ensure the protection and preservation
of this interesting small whale of our coastal fauna.

ting, contact Mark Palmer, Whale Center, 3929 Pied-
mont Ave., Oakland, CA 94611; (415) 654-6621.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Gill Nets Endanger Whales

According to a recent report in “The Marine Mam-
mal News,” the National Coalition for Marine Con-
servation/Pacific Region has charged the California
Department of Fish and Game with ignoring the
problem of whales becoming entangled in gill nets.
According to the Coalition, from 1980 to 1984 an
average of four confirmed entanglements of whales in

nets occurred, and in 1985 that number jumped to
13.

Sea Otter Population Not
Growing

A recent report from the California Department of
Fish and Game indicates that the state’s population of
sea otters has not increased since the early 19705. The
study area was a 220-mile range from Pt. Ano Nuevo
to the Santa Maria River, and the survey—conducted
in October and November 1985~revealed 1221 ot—

ters. Gill netting may be the cause.

Califomia Coastal
Cleanup a Success

‘ Last September, the Whale Center helped promote
a state-wide cleanup of California’s coast. The re-
ponse was hugely successful, as reflected in the
following letter we received from the state Depart-
ment of Fish and Game:
Dear Friends, '-
We appreciate your organization’s support of the
a] <. first annual California Coastal Cleanup Day. Com-
“ leted questionnaires were received from approx-
imately 30 percent of the Volunteers. We used that in-
":formation, along with that reported by the local coor-
é’dinators, to determine the nature and volume of the
{debris found on California beaches.
5 During the three-hour cleanup, 89 tons of trash
was picked up and removed. The data shoWed that
the biggest problem is glass, followed by styrofoam
and paper. We also noted a substantial amount of
fishing line, plastic netting and strapping, and plastic
is? bait bags.
We’ve selected Saturday, September. 20 for the
‘ 1986 event. Again, we’ll be coordinating with
Oregon and Washington to make this a total West
Coast effort. We hope to begin organizing and pub-
licizing much earlier and expect a large and en-
:‘t’thusiastic crowd.
Please mark your calendar and join us for Califor-
nia Coastal Cleanup Day 1986.

Senator Packwood Seeks
Assurance Against Trading
in Whale Products

The outlaw whaling nations (Japan, Soviet Union,
Iceland, Norway, South Korea and Philippines) not
only intend to continue killing whales, most (presum-
ably) intend to continue the illegal trade in whale
meat and oil as well. In December Senator Bob Pack-
wood (co- author of the Packwood-Magnuson amend—
ment, which makes it clear that any country violating
IWC decisions will automatically lose at least 50 per-
cent of its fishing rights within US. waters) wrote
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige the follow-
ing letter, expressing his concerns:

Dear Mac:

I am writing to follow up on statements made by
the Administrator of the National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration, Tony Calio, during his
nomination hearing before the Senate Commerce
Committee last July.

During Mr. Calio’s nomination hearing, I asked a
question regarding certification under the Packwood-
Magnuson amendment. As you know, the Packwood-
Magnuson amendment defines “certification” to
mean “a certification that a foreign nation is conduct-
ing fishing operations or engaging in trade or taking
that diminishes the effectiveness of the International
Whaling Commission’s conservation program.” In
response to my question regarding certification, Mr.
Calio stated that he would recommend certification
of any nation that engages in trade as an importer or
exporter of whale products taken after the effective
date of the IWC’s cessation of commercial whaling.

Mac, this is a very important issue to me. I was very
pleased with Mr. Calio’s response, especially because
at least one nation has announced that it will not

' comply with the cessation when it goes into effeetwr

uncertainties that may be lurking in the minds of
those who would thwart whale conservation.

I look forward to hearing from you soon and ap-
preciate your help.

Sincerely,

Bob Packwood

A month later, Secretary Baldrige wrote back giv-
ing the following assurance—a promise that the
Whale Center and other conservationists will keep
firmly in mind in the upcoming months:

Dear Bob,

Thank you for your letter regarding the Packwood-
Magnuson Act and Tony Calio’s testimony during his
confirmation hearing.

Your letter accurately reflects Tony’s testimony
and my sentiments about certification under the
Packwood-Magnuson Act. We will do everything we
can, including certification, to encourage compliance
with the International Whaling Commission (IWC)
moratorium and to discourage trade of whale
products.

Thank you for the opportunity to reaffirm my sup-
port for the IWC moratorium and the certification
process.

Sincerely,

Mac Baldrige

Good News for Black Sea
‘ Dolphins

Turkey has long had a fishery which slaughtered
Black Sea dolphins for oil and meat, but the killing
was halted in 1983 after loud and prolonged public
outcry, especially in Europe. The original cessation
was promised for “a period of at least one year."

The dolphins have been safe for three years now.

‘

and apparently the protection will continue. Turkey 5

.Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Rural Affairs

has announced plans for a National Dolphin Project
to take a census of dolphins in the Black Sea and study
their survival needs. The dolphin fiShery will remain

halted throughout this study.

 

Faroe Slaughter to
Continue

It appears the F aroe Islanders have every intention
to continue the cruel slaughter of pilot whales that we
have featured on the front page of our last two news-
letters. The F aroes are cooperating with a two-year
study of pilot whale stocks scheduled to begin this
year, and the F aroese government has formulated
regulations to make the islanders speed up the gory
death they inflict on each whale. But the government
staunchly defends the hunt, insisting it shall con-
tinue. In fact, F aroese Prime Minister Atli Dam has
admitted to reporters that his government has spent
$26,000 to date defending the F aroese position. Hor-
rified readers can send their comments to:

Moratorium Being Ignored

If the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling
was being honored, the icy waters of the Southern
Ocean would be calm and quiet for the first time in
decades. Sadly, that is not the case; harpoons are be-
ing exploded, and great whales are dying in anguish.
As of January 11, the Soviet whaling fleet had killed
743 minke whales and the Japanese, 414. At this
alarming rate, the fleets will have slaughtered over
5,000 whales before the killing season ends.

Iceland Minister Defends
“Scientific” Whaling

In a recent interview with “News From Iceland,"
that nation’s Fisheries Minister, Halldor Asgrimsson.
strongly defended his country’s intent to circumvent
the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling by con-
tinuing to kill whales under the guise of “scientific
whaling.” ' '

In a recent Newsletter article (Vol. 8, No. 3) \Vhale
Center Conservation Director Maxine McCloskey
pointed out that this scientific proposal is “nothing
more than a continuation of commercial whaling in
the guise of science. Not having objected to the mora-
torium. research permits provide the only means for
continuing (to slaughter whales with some semblance
of legality). Little or nothing could be gleaned from
further killing. If scientists haven't learned enough
about the general biology of whales after hundreds of
thousands have already been killed, how could they
possibly learn anything significant from those stocks
killed during a moratorium?"

Iceland has concluded a scientific research con-
tract with a whaling company to take 80 minkes, 80
fins, and 40 sei whales annually for the next four
years.

In the recent interview, Mr. Asgrimsson asserted:
"\Vhaling is not a question of money. Economically
we could put up with the loss of income if we suspend
whaling. but we cannot do this without knowing the
effects it would have on other stocks. and without
learning about the role of whales in the marine eco-
system. \Ve hope that advocates of conserving whale
stocks understand the connection between research
plans and our wish to protect these marvelous crea-
tures. This has been shown by legislation we passed
unilaterally suspending whaling in 1915 and again in
1938. No other nation in the world has made an effort
on such a scale. and nowhere are conditions as suited
to research on whales as they are here."

Readers who wish to suggest to the Iceland govern-
ment that the best way to “protect these marvelous
creatures" is leaving them alive, NOT killing them

1986 IWC Forecast

By Maxine McCloskey Conservation Director

the International Whaling Commission
(IWC), usually as an appointed member of
the United States government delegation. I did not
apply for appointment for .the' 1985 meeting, and)

S ince 1977 I have attended every meeting of

have not applied for the 1986 meeting, because the I. "

Whale Center felt that the United States government ‘
had been sidetracked from its former clear View of
seeking the moratorium on commercial whaling
through the auspices of the IWC. The U.S. govern-
ment has instead entered into an agreement (illegal in
the Whale Center’s view) with Japan that essentially
allows Japan to continue whaling for two years be-
yond the commencement of the moratorium, which
should have been effective in the December, 1985/
January, 1986 Antarctic season. But the killing
continues. .

Now, in February, 1986, I anticipate the 38th
meeting of the Commission (June 9-13 in Malmo,
Sweden) with trepidation. '

My apprehension stems from several quarters:

1. Only a few whaling countries are expected to
observe the moratorium: Brazil and Peru in the
Southern Hemisphere (Chile has already stopped).
None of the Northern Hemisphere commercial whal—
ing countries except for Spain are abiding: Japan and
the USSR are whaling right now on minke whales in
the Southern Ocean and Japan is killing sperm whales
off its coast. In addition, we expect that the Philip-
pines, Iceland, Norway, and Japan will continue
whaling later this year. It is not clear what South
Korea will do—we are hopeful that it will not pursue
its ill-founded proposal to conduct “research
whaling.”

2. The IWC is in grave financial trouble because
close to sixteen of its 40 member-nations are in arrears ’
in dues payments for two years or more. Five are in

‘ arrears for three or four years and have had their

voting and other rights suspended. They are:

0 Kenya—owing L17,433 since 1983/84 plus in-
terest of L784
24,447 since 1982/83 plus interest
of 1,135
47,496 since 1982/ 83 plus interest
of 3,160
34,059 since 1982/83 plus interest "
Of 1,797 '

40,269 since 1982/ 83 plus interest
of 2,418

Other nations with dues outstanding since 1984/85
are: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Belize, Brazil,
Chile, Costa Rica, India, Philippines, St. Lucia, St.
Vincent and Grenadines, and the Solomon Islands.

Counting the amounts owed by twelve nations
who are late in sending in their 1985/86 dues, a total
of L483,945 (approximately $681,000) in dues are
delinquent. There is a threat of insolvency. Will the
conservation groups have to undertake an interna-
tional series of bake sales to help keep the Commission
going? The Commission is the only- international
agency entrusted with the management authority of
whales. Now that it has turned around to become
more concerned with its charge of “the proper conser-
vation of whale stocks. . .” while de-emphasizing the '
other charge of making “possible the orderly develop-
ment of the whaling industry,”the conservation com-
munity sees that the Commission must continue to
function. But financial intransigence may be its
undoing.

3. Because of the U.S.-Japan deal that allows
Japan to continue whaling through 1987 with im-
punity, the United States has lost its leadership role at
the Commission. The U.S. voting record at the 1985
meeting was dismal. As reported (on page 1) in this
Newsletter, the lawsuit brought by the Whale Center
along with ten other conservation groups against the
U.S. government on the U.S.-Japan deal has been ap-
pealed by the government and the Japan Whaling
Association to the U.S. Supreme Court. The court
agreed to hear the case, and a decision is expected by
the end of the current session—June 30—probably
after the IWC meeting.

4. There will be a new set of faces in leadership
roles throughout the IWC—as well as in the U.S. At .
the 1985 meeting, the following new leaders were
elected: _

0 Chairman: I. L. G. Stewart (New Zealand)

0 Vice-Chairman: M. T. Haddon (UK), who also
serves as chairman of the Technical Committee

Whole Center’s First
Whale Symposium

from overly enthusiastic whalewatchers
A . and insights into our local whale popula-
~ ‘tions marked the recent two-day Symposium on
‘ Whales! sponsored by the Whale Center and the
ivoakland’Museum, held January 10—11, 1986, at the
g ‘- ‘ Oakland Museum.

» Friday’s symposium was aimed at an in-depth look
at the whalewatching industry, which adds a cal-
culated $4 million annually to California’s coastal
economy. Representatives agreed on a number of ef-
forts to publicize whalewatching guidelines
developed by the federal National Marine Fisheries

Service to protect whales from overzealous watchers.
Speakers noted that most problems of whale harass-
ifornia' waters comes from private boaters
g _ unaware that harassment of whales is a violation of

_.federal law and—in-many cases—unaware of what

constitutes harassment in the first place.

q “We want to protect the resource we depend on for
our livelihood, the great whales” said the Whale Cen-
ter’s Mark Palmer, “with the goal of also ‘making.
money whalewatching.”

James Lecky, a biologist with the National Marine

,.,;Fislieries Service, summed up the day’s conclusions
‘ by stating: “It’s premature to say that whalewatching
' ggihas had an adverse effect (off California’s coast), but

C onsiderable progress on protecting whales

' there probably is a cumulative impact that could

L reach a critical threshold. Enjoy the whales, observe
the guidelines, and spread the good word.”
Participating groups agreed to help publicize th
guidelines and educate boat owners and operators to
help protect whales. Participants also agreed to furth-
L- er cooperate on whalewatching promotion and re-
search. Participating groups included the Whale
._~ Center, the Oakland Museum, the National Marine
“fisheries Service, the Oceanic Society, American

Whale Center
Establishes
“Daisy Fund?’

this photo.

uring our symposium, Whale Center staff
and friends got to meet the remarkable hus-
band and wife team of Mark and Debbie
Ferrari. For the past ten years Debbie has been study-
ing humpback whales using benign (i.e. nonharass—
ing) research methods in the clear waters off the
Hawaiian island of Maui. For the past six years, her
husband Mark has joined her. Mark operates a rubber
dinghy while Debbie slips into the water with snor-
keling gear, and together they observe and photo-
graph the humpbacks during their birthing season.
The F erraris research is well respected in scientific
circles, and they have made many important break-
throughs in our understanding of humpback whales.
They have developed a method of photo-identi-
fication whereby they identify individual humpbacks
based on each whale’s unique pigmentation patterns
on flukes and ﬂippers, the shape of their dorsal fins,
and their distinctive lip grooves. They also have dis-

Daisy and one of her friendly calves. Our thanks to Debbie Ferrari for the use of

of her calves.

This year is a difficult year for the F erraris, how-
ever. Their funding has dried up, threatening their
research efforts. Since continuity is integral to their
work the F erraris have determined to carry on, hope-
ful that funds will appear.

Here at the Whale Center, we respect the F erraris
and their work so much that we have decided to es-
tablish a special “Daisy Fund” to help finance their
research. We urge sympathetic readers to send us a
check in care of the Whale Center and marked “Daisy
, Fund.” We are in contact with the F erraris in Hawaii

v and will make sure that the money gets directly to

3 them. On behalf of the F erraris and their important
work, we thank you for your benevolence. ’V

1y, application of that research to decisions being
made that effect our ocean ecosystems— and thereby

 

ourselves. Regarding marine mammals, Dr. Earle
commented: “Marine mammals are ambassadors of
_ the oceans, giving us new insights and perspectives in-
to our oceans. A new sensitivity has come about due
L. to our caring for whales.”
_ In her closing remarks, Dr. Earle said: “We have
reached a point in time where we have critical deci-
sions to make. The power we have to rule the fate of
ourselves and the creatures around us is at a pivotal
’ point. Decisions such as: ‘Shall there or shall there not
*be any great whales on this planet?’ By taking—or not
{taking—action, that decision is going to be made in
"our lifetime. If not, the decision that leads to the
,sidemise of the great whales will lead to our own.”
Maxine McCloskey, founding president of the
Whale Center, spoke of the long fight toend commer-
-, ‘fcial whaling on the international level. “We are close
:I to ending whaling at last,” she noted, “but even now
j Whalers are killing whales in the Antarctic. Our job is
5 not yet done!”

of the story of Humphrey the Wayward
ale by Mark Ferrari, who along with his
wife Debbie was involved in every moment of Hum-
‘J'phrey’s 25-day odyssey exploring the San Francisco
Bay and Delta. Mark told of the remarkable efforts of
.LLLLdOZens of volunteers, the many ups and downs, ten-
sz’sions and anxieties leading to the ultimately successful
; rescue effort, and the difficulty of dealing with a
L e understood by scientists and the public

:. At the end of Mark’s emotional story, he took a
deep breath and said: “We all keep talking about how
‘ I ‘Save the Whale!’ Well, we did it—we ac-
ed one!” .

perience: “The whole Humphrey thing brought out

ce, Garamendi commented: “If you don t

enough to save all the rest?” The Whale Center also
ﬁQIIQI‘ed Debbie and Mark Ferrari for their efforts In

the rescue, and thanked .111 the; partigigantsu who .-

“helped Humphrey back to the ocean.

 

 

At another point in the afternoon, Maxine McClos-
key presented renowned whale artist Larry Foster
with the Whale Center’s annual conservation aWard
in recognition of how his art has helped bring whales
and people closer together. Maxine lauded how truly
inspiring Larry’s artwork is, and praised the
astonishing anatomical detail and accuracy of his
work.

Upon receiving his award Larry quietly told the
crowd: “It’s not really true that I spend a great deal of
time out in the wild studying whales. I actually do
most of my drawings straight from photographs.” He
then concluded one of the world’s briefest acceptance
speeches with a sheepish grin and the admission: “I’m
really more like the Bird Man of Alcatraz!”

During a panel discussion following all the
speakers, everyone agreed that there really is no
unified view of what is going on with marine mam-
mals and their conservation, either in the California
area or on a global basis, and that more efforts such as
this symposium are needed.

Maxine McCloskey noted that the value of such
symposiums is in their helping to inform the public of
the status of whales and the need to conserve both the
whales themselves and their Ocean habitat. Addi-
tionally, these symposiums provide a public forum
for discussion of goals, priorities, and conservation
aims of nonprofit groups to better communicate and
cooperate in the effort to save the whales. .?

Whale Center in the News!

This is a critical time in the long campaign of con-
servationists to end the slaughter of the great whales.
Most of the public remembers seeing bold headlines
proclaiming the IWC moratorium and erroneously
assumes the whales are now safe. But conservation
groups are frantically trying to get out the word that
quite the opposite is true: several nations (Japan,
Soviet Union, Norway, Philippines, S. Korea and Ice-
land) either are or intend to continue the slaughter.

One bright ray in all this gloom is the fact that in
the past five months the Whale Center has received
more media attention than ever before in its history,
and we’re using the opportunity to warn people about
the true whaling situation.

The media blitz began in the November issue of
Audubon magazine, when author Richard Ellis kind-
ly lent us increased exposure by mentioning our work
in his article “A Sea Change for Leviathan.”

The next month, the UPI wire service picked up
our Adopt-a-Whale program and spread the news all
over the country. Members have sent us articles from
their local papers in such diverse places as the “Las
Vegas Review-Journal;” the “Anchorage Times;”
“The Blade” from Toledo, Ohio; and “The Gastonia
Gazette” from Gastonia, North Carolina. Just this
month, our adoption program received coverage in
the “LA. Times” Sunday magazine and the current
edition of “California” magazine.

Our whalewatching cruises 'and experience have
jbeen reported in such publications as the “East Bay

Express” and “Argus,” and Whale Center photo—
- graphersﬁelped illustrate an article on whalewatch-
ing in the November/December issue of “Outdoor
California” magazine.

Our innovative and unique WhaleBus program has
. also been the subject of much attention, especially in
§ the “Hayward Daily Review” and the “Oakland
j Tribune.”

. Successful whale conservation has a long rocky
road still ahead of it, but exposure in the media is
clearly one method of achieving our aims. If these
past few months are any indication, that media op-
portunity is at hand—it is up to us now to get the
word out. “Save the .Whales!”.——our campaign is not

cerns me greatly that conservationists would turn
to these same “ownership” arguments in promoting
their fimd-raising efforts on behalf of their “save-the-

t is essential that those of us who work to protect
the whales continue to respect their independence
and freedom from humankind’s possession. Just as
they cannot be “owned” by a country for purposes of

mmercial slaughter, they cannot be “owned” by in-
dividuals concerned for their welfare—however be-

The real issue runs deeper. There is
more to boiling water than pouring
some in a pot, putting it on the stove.
turning on the heat and waiting for
bubbles to appear mysteriously in the
depths, careen dizzily to the surface. and
there silently explode into the steam
that makes a kitchen alive. Female per-
sons used to do that all the time, with-
out a second thought. But it is the
thought that counts. The decision to
boil water raises questions that go to the
core of style, of human expression, of
who and what we really are.

Let’s say we have been out shopping;
we’re tired, and a cup of tea seems just
the thing. It is a simple matter to walk
into the kitchen, step to the sink, turn
on the tap. There is a high probability,
as a scientist might say, that water will
emerge. just plain water. No French
bubbles. No “natural” lime ﬂavor. Just

\ v

water. Merely a simple combination of
the primordial stuff of the Universe
(hydrogen) and a hyperactive refine-
ment (oxygen) formed deep within a
star and then flung out into space for
the benefit of the next generation. What
do the sociobiologists have to say about
stellar altruism? (Waiter: ”Would any-
one care for something from the bar?"
Patron: "Not for me, thanks. Just bring
me something from an exploded star”)

Some of the liquid coming out of the
tap, as beﬁts its cosmic origins. is very
old—water that ﬁrst reached the surface
of the Earth eons ago in a rain of comets
or the outgassing of primordial volca-
noes. Since then it might have spent a
million years here, a million there: per-
colating through the ground until it
gushed forth in a spring; moving with a
cold current, deep in the ocean. More
recently it has evaporated from the sur-
faces of oceans only to fall as rain over
land, been breathed out by a tree and
then rained down again to be drunk by
a swallow on the wing. It has been va-
por in the tropics and a rigid lattice in
the Arctic. Now it has fallen as rain in

 




the watershed of a river and been cli-
vertcd into the apparatus ol a munici—

might have said, “The style is the male

Tea is a contemplative drink, and
there are the questions of society at
large and the future of our species to
consider. Do we have the unbridled au-
dacity to heat on an electric range? If
those generators are turned with the
steam from nuclear ﬁres (now there are
people who really boil some water),
should we mail a check for our share in
the cost of the future decommissioning
of that plant, covering it in concrete
and guarding it for 25,000 years from
our curious descendants, if any? If by
coal or oil, do we have a clear picture of
exactly whose air and water we will poi-
son to brew our tea? Or do we have the
laboratory efﬁciency of natural gas, the
bright blue flame of life long past? Shall
we return to our lost Eden, using wood
the way our people have always done?
Sustain ourselves with broken bits of the
living Caia? We must always be wary of
culture clash: Is it politically correct to

mesquite charcoal?

on any other well-run spaceship, the
water we chose to boil would be re-
cycled. Some would escape as steam to
humidify the air in a winter house, to be
breathed in and out until ﬁnally it is
exhaled outside and escapes back to the
sky to rain again on some other conti-
nent. The part we actually drink would
also be recycled, although at somewhat
higher expense to society. It, too, would
eventually return to the ocean, to the
sky, to another river so that someone
else—next week or next millennium——
could pour it into a pot and brew up
some tea.

No, we cannot do it because too much
is at. stake here. In these troubled times,
when death lurks in the very air we
breathe and in the water we drink.
when the fate of the planet hangs on our
smallest actions, to boil a quart of water
for tea would be going too far.

Secretary A dams’ comments

Smithsonian horizons

A technique originally developed
for overcoming human infertility

may also help endangered species

Surrogate motherhood is a subject of
much ethical and legal controversy
these days—as an application of advanc-
ing medical technology to speciﬁcally
human desires or needs. At the National
Zoo, Smithsonian specialists in repro—
ductive biology are pioneering another
use of the same technology. They are
offering assistance, now often desperately
needed, in the ﬁght for survival of some
of the great wild animals who not so
long ago were able to contend with us
on more equal terms for a place in the
food chain on which all life depends.

In vitro fertilization (IVF), a proce-
dure also increasingly used to help
human couples overcome infertility, in-
volves a technique known as laparos-
copy. The process usually begins with
hormonal injections to stimulate ovar-
ian activity. By directly observing the
ovary by means of a narrow-diameter
ﬁber-optic telescope inserted through
the abdominal wall, eggs can then be
recovered before their natural release.
Mixed with the sperm of a male and
kept for a time in a culture chamber,
those giving evidence of cell division
then can be transferred surgically, some-
times even nonsurgically, into a female’s
reproductive tracts—ordinarily but not
necessarily the original donor’s.

All this is by now well understood
in its application to human beings and
to domestic livestock. Zoo animals are
another matter. Reproductive difficulties
are frequently encountered in them, but
have generally been studied as problems
focusing on courtship and other behav—
ioral patterns that might be resolved.
Particularly in the case of carnivores,
expertise~-~not to speak of medical or

ﬁnancial incentive—has usually been
lacking. For some years, however, exper-
imental work guided by David Wildt,
reproductive physiologist at the Na-
tional Zoo, has been directed toward
this end. It was not initially conducted
on endangered species but on their do—
mestic relatives, household cats.

Artiﬁcial insemination has met with
only limited success in cats, although
the propensity of the house cat to breed
profusely in human proximity and
without human intervention is well at-
tested by any neighborhood bulletin
board. It is hoped that, buttressed by
some preliminary ﬁndings on the di-
minutive leopard cat, the IVF techniques
now successful with this species will be
applicable also to more exotic members
of the cat family that often have much
greater difﬁculty breeding in captivity.
The list includes, for example, the
clouded leopard, the cheetah, the flat-
headed cat of Sumatra and certain tigers.
Males and females of some of these spe-
cies are frequently incompatible under
conditions of captivity, and may ser-
iously injure or kill each other when
paired for mating.

The technology has a true conserva-
tion potential. In recent months the
Zoo’s research team has successfully
adapted IVF to producing embryos
from one larger species of cat, the
puma. The incentive for this work is the
effort to save the highly endangered
Florida panther (a subspecies of puma),
whose total number has dwindled to
fewer than 25.

The potential advantages of IVF, not
merely for zoo management but for spe-
cies survival, are enormous. Rare, easily
frightened animals need not be sub-
jected to the stress of physical trans-
fer from place to place. If the donor
female is reproductively unsound, the

fertilized embryos may be implanted in
a surrogate of the same or a taxonomi-
cally related species. And sperm and
embryos alike can be frozen and stored
indeﬁnitely—possibly even permitting at
a future time the reintroduction into the
wild of some then-vanished species.

Zoological parks must be seen not only
as leisure and educative resources for
human visitors, but increasingly also as
zones of refuge in which captive breed-
ing programs can be maintained until
some sort of sanity is introduced into
our relations with our global cohabi-
tants. If we cherish more than a memory
of the world as it was before our grow-
ing numbers, instruments of destruction
and mountains of poisonous debris oblit-
erated so much of it, research like this
in zoological parks may hope to carry
something forward for our children’s
children.

Probably many SMITHSONIAN readers
are familiar with John McPhee’s classic
account of contemporary Alaska, Com-
ing into the Country. His description of
the sparsely settled region along the Yu-
kon, and especially of the subtle, rich
and uneasy coexistence of people and
grizzly bears, with neither species in a
position of uncontested dominance, has
etched itself into my memory even
though I have never managed to get
there. Marginal and perhaps transitory
as it is, this shared dominion is the near-
est equivalent we have to a living record
of how things were during all but the
shortest and most recent interval of the
immensely longer human career. With
a little more help from reproductive
biologists and allied specialists, perhaps
we can retain the vital symbolism as well
as some of the substance of a shared
Earth for future generations.

Wacky ‘Cheers' Star Parties
“With Monkeys & Charges Pals

gt iiyﬂdt

Her Lavish Mansion

“Cheers” star Kirstie Alley and her actor-husband Parker
Stevenson live an incredibly bizarre life-style —— they rent out
rooms in their lavish home, often eat breakfast with monkeys sin
a gage, and have all their clothes dry-cleaned every single month!

The carefree couple fre-
quently close off the streets
around their estate in Enci—
no, Calif, so they can safely
race go-carts with pals. And
visitors never know what to
expect when they go ilidoors
-— because Kirstie constant-
ly moves the furnishings
around.

“They’ re two of the wild-
est, craziest people I’ve ever
met, ” said a close friend
of Kirstie and her “Hardy
Beys” hubby of five years.

“Kirstie and Parker enjoy
company so much that they
recently turned the entire
east wing of their 12-bed-
room home into an exclusive
bed- and- breakfast inn for
friends only.

“Guests stay in three bed-
rooms, all with private
baths.

“The cook and servants
cater to every whim of the
guests, who stay one, two or
three nights and pay $100 a
night. ”

Kirstie and her husband
love animals and have a
backyard zoo that 1'nﬂdes

exotic birds, dogs and cats.

“The cage is l"ﬁg—'ﬂn—ﬂlmnfurnished

She's a chain-smoker — so she
and her husband spend $1,000
a month on dry cleaning to keep
their clothes smelling fresh.

 

 

Kirstie and Parker eatm breakfast in it with
the monkeys several mornings a meeek ” said
a M10 the couple.

“They treat the monkeys liket their kids
and even have had parties in the cage with
1he“:r‘1'1"""“"‘“‘~

The couple own four gasoline-powered
go- -,carts and on many weekends they use
wooden “horses” to block off the streets
around their estate -—— then zoom up and
down the streets with pals like Tom Cruise,
his wife Mimi Rogers and John Travolta,
the source said. .

Kirstie is a chain—smoker — and she
and Stevenson send their clothes out to be
dry-cleaned once a month, at a cost of more
than $1000 a month, to keep them from ‘
smelling like smoke, insiders say.

The actress also moves her furniture
and rugs around at least once a month.
“Each time I visit, the house never looks the
same, ” said her friend

An antique nut, Kirstie has bought so
many costly old items that ———---—'*
she has one bedroom stuffed
with things she’s bought but
can’t find a place for!

She and Stevenson also
treat themselves to massages
at home by a professional
masseuse nearly every night

 

 

— and they have expensive
chocolates flown in from
Switzerland at least once a
month.

At one point, Kirstie saw
the ghost of an old woman in
the home’s private chapel,

 

 

said the soarce. “So she and
her husband brought in a
psychic to perform a cleans-
ing ritual -— and neither she
rior Parker have seen the
ghost since."

Because Kirstie has a fear
of flying, she and Stevenson
recently bought a railroad
car for $150, 000 and are

redecorating it at a cost of

 

about $30,000 so they can

travel in style!

Said Kirstie’s publicist,
Jim Dobson: “Kirstie and
Parker are having the time
of their lives. Some peOple
might think they’re wacky,
but everyone loves them.-

“They bring out the kid in
everybody they meet. ”

By The Associated Press

 

WASHINGTON —— Fifteen
years after Congress enacted a
law to protect endangered spe-
cies, most of the nearly 500 types
of animals and plants show no
signs of recovery and many con-
tinue their slide toward
extinction, a congressional study
said Thursday;

p The General Accounting Ofﬁce
criticized a practice by the Fish
and Wildlife Service of con-
centrating on high-proﬁle spe-
cies, such as the bald eagle and
Aleutian Canada goose, over spe-
cies on the verge of extinction.

“Instead of giving priority to
the most endangered species and
to those actions needed to pre-
vent extinctions in the foresee-
able future, as required by its
guidelines, FWS instead is con-~

centrating recovery funds crisper.M
cies with high ‘public appeal’ and E

those approaching recovery,” 7
GAO wrote. l

“FWS ofﬁcials told GAO that
the desire for a positive public
View of the program . . . is mo—
tivating its actions.”

Rep. GerryaStuddspD-Mass., J
who requested the study bythe 1
congressional watchdog agency, ’
said the GAO’s conclusions “re— ‘
inforce my own view that a more
5 serious-and professional ap-
. proach to protecting endangered
species is required if the goals of
federal law are to be met.”

Elizabeth Lipscomb, a
; spokeswoman for the .Fish and
Wildlife Service, which has juris-
diction over the vast majority of
the threatened and endangered
species, defended the agency’s
programs and practices.

“We feel that it’s "important to
devote resources to species that
the public is concerned about,
high visibility species like the
bald eagle,” she said. “That
doesn’t necessarily mean we’re
not spending money on other
species. We’re spending money
on a lot of obscure species that
people don’t know about.”

The GAO study said that of
the 493 species protected under
the Endangered Species Act of
1973, ﬁve have been declared re-
' covered while six have become
extinct.

The review also concluded that
while 75 of the species have
improved, 165 have declined, 12
are extinct but not yet ofﬁcially
declared so and 179 have shown
; no change. The status of the re-

1

 

maining 51 of the species was not
known.

The Fish and Wildlife Service
had drafted by September 1987
recovery plans for 56 percent of
the species and had plans under
way for another 18 percent.

In 16 recovery plans analyzed
by GAO investigators, nearly half
the tasks have not been under-
taken even though the plans were
approved on an average of more
than four years ago.

Studds, chairman of the House
Merchant Marine and. Fisheries
subcommittee on fisheries and
wildlife conservation, is the au-
thor of a new law that requires
the administration to report to
Congress every two years on the
status of recovery efforts.

Studds also criticized spending
for the endangered species pro-
grams. Financing levels .have re—

mained fairly constant in recent
years, and the congressman said
the Reagan administration’s
ﬁscal 1990 budget calls for a 34
percent decrease.

The GAO report said 12 spe-,
cies are extinct but have yet to be
declared so. They are: Mariana
mallard, Mariana fruit bat, Palos
Verdes blue butterfly, Scioto
madtom, Bachman’s warbler, ,
giant anole, tuberculed-blossom
mussel, turgid-blossom mussel,
yellow-blossom mussel, dusky
seaside sparrow, ivorybilled
woodpecker and eastern cougar.

The recovery of the brown pel-
ican in the southeastern United
States seems to be attributed to
the nationwide ban on the pesti-
cide DDT, while the “recovery”
of the Palau dove, Palau fantail
and Palau owl simply stems from
the discovery of more birds.

West Bank bureau

 

The members of two environ-
mental groups that are suing the
National Park Service over trap-
ping in Jean Lafitte National
Historical Park have been
dropped from the park’s citizen
advisory panel.

Orleans Audubon Society-

member Barry Kohl and Fund
for Animals representative Sid-
ney Rosenthal were not reap-
pointed to the Delta Region
Preservation Commission, the
park’s citizen advisory group,
after serving more than eight
years each on the commission.
Both were renominated by their
organizations, Kohl said.

A spokesman for the Interior
Department said Monday that a
suit filed by commission mem-
bers is not “a legal bar” to being
appointed. Tom Wilson said he
did not know former Interior
Secretary Donald Hodel’s reasons
for making the changes on the
Jean Lafitte panel. Hodel left
ofﬁce Thursday.

In November, Hodel appointed
Cornelia Carrier, a board member
of the Coalition to Restore
Coastal Louisiana, and Ron
Jones, a member of the Audubon
Institute, to replace Rosenthal

and Kohl, whose terms had ,

expired.

Jones said Friday he has re-
signed the appointment because
of other commitments.

Several environmental and
civic groups and two park com-
mission members questioned
whether Hodel’s appointments

represent local environmental
groups. ‘ a
Last week, at the commission’s
ﬁrst meeting‘since the appoint-
ments were made, St. Bernar
commission member Mike Bour-
geois asked‘the commission to re-
fuse the appointments of Carrier
and Jones. _ i
In an angrily worded resolu-
tion, Bourgeois charged that the
appointments violate thencon—
gressional act creating the.;p,ark
because the act calls for three~ap-
pointments to be made.fx9m
nominations by local .COnser-
vation organizations. ‘ .
Bourgeois said Kohl and Ro-
senthal were local conservation-
ists’ choices but they were;jrgot
reappointed because of politics.
Bourgeois’ motion died forl'ack
of a second. However, commis-
sion member Charlotte .Fre‘r'riéiux
distributed copies of letters" frOm

’ “ All traps should be banned
from Jean Laﬁtte National Park
because they can’t distinguish be-
tween nutria and other animals,
members of two humane organi—

; zations and the park’s advisory

" board saidTuesday. |

A partial settlement in Novem-
ber of a suit over trapping in the
park calls for temporary bans on

[trapping otters, minks, raccoons

. and other animals, but, it allows .

. trapping of nutria. ,
. Spokesmen for the two hu-
,mane groups and some members
' of the Delta Region Preservation
" Commission, the park’s citizen
advisory panel, said Tuesday that
that can’t be done.
The commission, which
advises the Interior Department
on issues affecting Jean Laﬁtte,

asked Louisiana’s congressional
delegation to help prohibit trap-
ping in its Barataria marsh unit
near Marrero.

The Orleans Audubon Society,
the Fund for Animals and the
Delta Chapter of the Sierra Club
sued in 1987 to stop trapping
pending studies to determine its
effects on the park’s animal pop-
ulation.

Park ofﬁcials agreed to tempo-
rarily ban trapping of all animals
except nutria, which are apoten-
tial threat because they can eat

- all vegetation when they become

too numerous and because they
are not native.

“You cannot set a trap just for
nutria,” Commissioner Frank

Fernandez said. Fernandez, a for-

mer trapper, said traps are placed
on paths worn by nutria in the
marsh. But'the paths are used by
animals such as minks, otters
and raccoons as well, and those

animals are also trapped, he said.

Birds including herons and ibis

are also caught in the traps,
Commissioner Frank Ehret said.
' Members of Animal Peace and
the Jefferson Society for the Pre—
vention of Cruelty to Animals
objected to continued trapping
and hunting, calling the practices
unnecessary and inhumane.

The pain to animals caught in
the steel leg-hold traps used 10-
cally is like being cruciﬁed, Nich-
olas Spivey of Animal Peace said.
He said animals Sometimes gnaw
their legs off to. escape, and he

held up a trap in which an animal

had left its paw.

BarryKohl, of the Orleans Au-
dubon Society and a former com-
missioner, said later that
alternative traps which do not
kill or injure animals were dis-
cussed in meetings over the suit,
but park officials did not say
what traps they would allow.

 

The humane groups also critf
icized the settlement’s provisions
for injured animals.

Animals other than nutria that
are trapped but not killed are to
be released or “put to sleep” and
their pelts conﬁscated, the set-
tlement said.

The Louisiana Nature and Sci-
ence Center in eastern New
Orleans has a rehabilitation pro-
gram for injured and orphaned
wildlife.

Park Superintendent M. Ann
Belkov said trappers who lease
areas of the park must agree not
to trap anything but nutria.

“We are monitoring those
leases,” she said.

But Belkov refused to elab-
orate on how the bans are being
carried out because of the suit.
She said a meeting is scheduled
next week with US. District
Judge Charles Schwartz concern-
ing the partial settlement.

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Plain Southern Eating: 91M" llgq
From the Reminiscences

of A. L. Tommie Bass, Herbalist
Compiled and edited byjohn K. Crellin
Duke University Press, $12.95
Spur/4.56 ‘1! F] A)

This little book presents A. L. Tommie
Bass, who enjoys some fame throughout
the South, having appeared on televi—
sion and radio, including the Alabama
segment of the Turner Network’s Por-
trait of America. Bass, 80, lacking a
formal education, has spent his life
"truck farming and peddling with his
father, cutting crossties, trapping and

fur dealing, grave digging, plumbing
houses, sharpening saws, and selling
herbs to individuals and wholesale
companies.”

John Crellin, an associate professor in
the Medical History Program at Duke

University, allows Tommie Bass to tell
in his own words these reminiscences,
recipes, and bits of health and nutri-
tional advice rooted in the Appalachians
where he grew up and lives.

Central to this way of life now rap-
idly disappearing (even Bass relishes a

“receipts,” as my grandmother would
call them, are for corn dishes: hominy,
corn silk tea, hoecake, cornmeal mush,
mush biscuits, spoon bread, corn on the

I tend to agree with Bass, who feels
intuitively that smoked ham, red-eye
gravy and eggs are not inherently bad
for us; that it’s artiﬁcial feeds, pesticides,
herbicides anb hcrchernicalSthat
create the problem:

”Everyone knew eggs was good for
you. Now people are not so sure! The
way we keep chickens has also changed.
In the old days they let the chickens run
out, and they would fence the garden.
Now, they fence the chickens and let the
garden run out!”

Life comes full circle. Frefzrange
chickens race gourmet restaurant
menus these days. I learned a few new
things from these recollections, though.
In Bass’ day, buttermilk and vinegar
served many purposes. Wholesome
foods, they ranked highly as medicinals
and household cleaners, too. Also

nourishing.”

Plain Southern Eating is a delightful
addition to the growing number and
wide range of Southern cookbooks.
Some additional recipes found here are
for vinegar pie, cobblers, squirrel, rab-
bit and pickles. Bass also offers descrip-
tions of natural insectxcxdes, planting by
astrological signs, hog killings and
superstitions.

For A. L. Tommie Bass, “practitioner
of the old ways,” life’s real gift lies in a
close and symbiotic relationship with
the world. All the old things, indeed,

are nearly gone now:

“These days people are always asking

‘me how things have changed. I can’t
open my mouth and the tape recorder
goes. I’ve told you a big thing is, people
don’t cook and garden so much like
they did in my days. Lots of farmers got
to be big farmers, and the little man,
you know, went out. Now the big
farmer doesn’t even raise a garden, and
then he claims he is going broke. . . .
The farmer’s not supposed to be a city
man. He is supposed to be with nature.”

The charm of Plain b‘outnern mating

sometimes melancholy memories with

often the case with Southern cooking.
And he regrets that more folks don’t eat

In the last third of the book, Crellin

On the morning of Jan. 18
there was a pack of seven large
dogshone quite recently injured,
roaming on Bayou St. John. I
pulled over and called the SPCA:
a concerned citizen’s response.

The person at the SPCA who

took away our funds as of Nov. 1.
There is not a thing we can do.”

This pack of dogs will now
roam, along with who knows how
many other packs in the city,

maimed in trafﬁc, hunting peo-

acting as a reservoir for animal

Whatever the reason the city
may have cut the funds to the
SPCA, this is a sorrowful situ-

led to this cutback are argued or
repaired or ignored, the con-

BOSTON —— A drug intended
to stop the spread of AIDS by
mimicking a part of the blood cell
it usually infects has proved
highly effective in experiments
on monkeys, experts report.

The animal research provides
the first clear evidence outside
the test tube that the strategy
has a chance of slowing and per—

ple.

Even if the treatment works as

of the virus.

Doctors are testing the drug,
CD4, on people infected with
AIDS, but the results will not be
known for several weeks or
months.

CD4 is designed to be a decoy
target for HIV, the AIDS virus,
deflecting it from healthy blood

cells. CD4 is a natural molecule '
to which the virus is attracted on ’

the surface of some blood cells.
The treatment cannot wipe out
the virus inside a cell. But if CD4

The latest research, conducted
at the Harvard-affiliated New

The monkeys were infected

with simian immunodeficiency

Women Outnumbering Men inﬁl‘Iet schools

0 women care more for
animals than men do?
There is no empirical
evidence that they do,
but the fact is that more
women than men have enrolled
in the nation’s 27 schools of
veterinary medicine since 1985.
The American Veterinary
Medical Association reports that
the enrollment in the 1985-86
school year consisted of 50.8%
women and 49. 2% men; in
1986-87, it was 53% women and
47% men; and in 1987-88, it was
55.3% women and 44.7% men.
In some vet schools, the trend

i began more than a decade ago.

Dr. Robert J. Hansen of the
University of California vet
school at Davis, says:
“Throughout the profession,
applications from women have
remained fairly constant since
1974, while those from men
have decreased significantly.”
“The reason fewer men are

‘

rm 6 "Wartime

applying,” says Dr. Cassie Jones,
a veterinarian in Los Angeles,
“has nothing to do with their
relative love of animals. In my
opinion, going to vet school
makes little economic sense to
many men. If they have to put
in four years of pre—med study
and four years of vet school
medicine, most would rather
become physicians. They will
earn more.” (In 1985, for
example, veterinarians in the
US. averaged $43,590, while
physicians averaged $112,200).
Dee Jenkins of the AVMA
says: “Approximately 21% of our
47,235 members are women,
with more joining every year.”
Inevitably, it appears, women
will take over the profession,
because being a vet is no longer
considered a man’s occupation.
Modern technology has made
it just as easy for women as it
is for men to treat large animals,
such as horses, cows and sheep.

Research Target

1" someone were to ask you
to guess the disease that
the drug companies in this
country have made their
major target for new
research and development,
which would you come up with?

The correct answer, says
the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers Association, is
cardiovascular disease—the
leading cause of death in the
US. , particularly among older
people. A review of its new"
survey, the association
declares, shows that 47 of its
member—companies are hard
at work developing 87 drugs
for heart disorders, stroke,
hypertension and other
cardiovascular diseases. All
87, it says, are being tested on
humans or are awaiting

EDINBURG, Texas —— The
95—year-old father of Democratic
vice presidential candidate Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen Jr. was killed in a
trafﬁc accident Tuesday.

Lloyd Bentsen Sr., died in a
two-vehicle collision after appar—
ently failing to yield the right of
way at a rural intersection be—
tween Edinburg and Mission
near the Mexico border, said Po—
lice Chief A.C. Gonzales.

The senior Bentsen, an early
developer of Texas’ Lower Rio
Grande Valley, remained active
in his farming, ranching and real
estate interests until his death.

“He was here two or three
times a week, sometimes every
day,” said Bud Williams, foreman
for the past 25 years at Bentsen’s
16 ,000- -acre La Comajanch in
Hidalgo County, one of six
ranches Bentsen. owned. r‘He was

In the winter of 1981 a large
olony of bats was found hanging
. nder the roof of a building at
arver Middle School.

Robert Thompson, supervisor
,of grounds and pest control in
ew Orleans public schools, de—
vised a safe way to evict the 300
or so intruders from the giant,

Work crews plugged cracks to
keep the bats out and Thompson
thought he had his problem
licked. But the bats keep ﬁnding
a way in and some have come
back to roost, creating a cbnstant
battle for Thompson and fear
among parents that the animals
may be health threats.

“They’re all over town,” Bob
Thomas, director of the Louisi-
ana Nature Center said.

But the much-maligned, noc-

turnal creatures that evoke
images of caves and vampires are
no cause for hysteria, health au—
thorities and wildlife specialists
said. The species of bats in New
Orleans are not disease-carrying
and have small teeth because
they are insect eaters, Oscar Me-
drano, chief of environmental
health for the city, said.

Dr. Brobson Lutz, city health
department director, confirmed
that New Orleans has had no dis-

come every da3 at sundown in
droves of biblical proportion,
hundreds of thousands of black
birds diving and screeching with
fury enough to strike the tea1 of
God in some traveler down
Rocky Creek Road on the east
end of this little crossroads town.

In the morning they leave, only
to return later in the day with a
few more in their midst, strag—

To the dismay of the 2,300 res-
idents of Ashford and dozens of,
larger Southern cities and towns.
this is a winter ritual. as birds
from across the northeastern
United States come South for
warmer weather and nourish
ment.

They eat the feed farmers set
out for cattle and chickens. They
spatter cars and rooftops. Their
roosts smell from a quarter mile
away. They make life hell for pol-
iticians.

“You (an sit and talk to people
to reason out a problem,’
Ashtord Mayor Roy Hobbs said.
“But these birds, you can ’t sit

and talk with them. I know. I’ve
tried.”

When reason failed him,
Hobbs shot at the birds, empty—
ing a case of shotgun shells to no
avail. Then be loaded diesel and
pesticide into mosquito loggers
and tried to choke them out.
Then he set fire to a pile of tires

”to try to scare them away.

“They always set tires on fire,”
said Frank Boyd, a bird specialist
with the U. S. Department of
Agriculture. “I’ve seen it a dozen
times. I don’t know where they
get that idea.”

But Hobbs will tell you, black-
birds make folks do strange
things. He got calls thanking him
when he set the tires on fire, even
though they sent a toxic black
cloud over everybody’ s homes.

“The people would rather
smell tires than all those drop-
pings, ’Hobbs said, rolling up an-
other wad ot' HB. Scott chewmg
tobacco, staring into the sky like
he does each night. “They were

So last week, he ordered the
demolition of the woods with the

town’s only piece of heavy equip-
ment — a backhoe.

“If they paid taxes I__g_uess they

'wouldn’t be so bad,” the 68—year-
old mayor said. “Man, I got
birds, I got birds, I got birds.”

The birds have made the cor-
ner of Rocky Creek and Oak
roads their roost. That’s Willie
Cochrane’s back yard. He’s got
birds, too.

He’s a city councilman, and so
he has some explaining to do.

9“,,They say to me: ‘When you
gonna get rid of them birds, when
you gonna get rid of them birds?’
But the more you kill, the more
they come back,” he said.

As he spoke, a white dollop hit
him 011 top of the head.

“My kids came home for
Christmas,” he said, pulling a
handkerchief from his pocket,
dabbing at his New York Mets
hat. “Man, they couldn’t wait to
get out of here. The smell in the
morning, oooh wee, it’s awful.”

, Once, Cochrane shot a dozen
«or so birds and gave them to

3 Alice Brunson up the street, who

cooked them to make a blackbird
pie.

i *“The more I cooked them, the
tougher they got,” she said. “I’m
92‘ years old and I’ve never seen
so many birds in my life. They’ re
making me crazy. They’ re mak
ing us all crazy.’

It doesn’t make "them feel any
better, but Ashford’s residents
are not the only ones up to their
ankles in bird trouble.

The blackbird problem is wide—

portions only Alfred Hitchcock
could appreciate.

At Maxwell Air Force Base in
central Alabama, about a million
birds roost near a runway, posing
deadly possibilities l<'1r jet engines
and their pilots.

ln Huntsville, the US. Depart-
ment of Agriculture last month
sprayed a single roost with a le
thal detergent mixture, leaving
700,000 birds dead 111 a heap.

In Greenwood, Miss, the
USDA set up a harassment strike
force that shot fireworks and

volume from stereo speakers to
chase a roost from the town
square.

And on the north shore of
Miller’s Lake, near Ville Platte 111
Evangeline Parish in southwes—
tern Louisiana, there is the
granddaddy of rOOSts.

There are 15 million to 25 mil-
lion birds in the forest there,
“more than we’ve ever seen ——
the largest on record,” said
Dwight LeBlanc, the state direc-
tor for the USDA animal damage
control ofﬁce in Louisiana.

The problems in Evangeline
are agricultural and economic

, rather than aesthetic.

Where Miller’s Lake ends, rice
paddies begin, and if the farmers
plant before the birds abandon
the roost this spring, the birds
will eat every grain the farmers
can plant.

But when the birds choose to

, roost where people live, they can

pose a serious'health problem.
In the thick of theAshford

roost, the 1111461“ droppings are
about 6 inches deep, according to
Boyd, the federal government’s
blackbird point man in Missis—
sippi and Alabama

Such conditions can breed a
soil fungus that, when airborne in
tiny particles, can lodge in
human lungs, causing histoplas
mosis

Histoplasmosis is often benign,
but it can develop into extended
flu like conditions and be fatal in
extreme cases.

Boyd’s job is to monitor black-
bird infestations and make sure
towns are effectively dealing with
the problem. In Ashford’s case,
Boyd said the mayor’s plan to
level the woods is probably the
only way to solVe the problem
without killing them, which is a

The mayor’s attack seems to
be working. By the end of last

WASHINGTON —— The gov—
ernment greatly expanded its role
in protecting workers from haz-
ardous materials Friday, setting
exposure limits for 164 sub—
stances for the first time and
tightening limits for 212 more in
changes officials said could save
700 lives a year.

 

 

. “This is a monumental job."
2 Assistant Labor Secretary John
Pendergrass said in announcing
the standards, which he said
r should significantly reduce the
; risk of illness to 21 million Amer—
1 icans who work in general indus—
, try and may be exposed to toxic
or hazardous materials.

About 4.5 million workers now
face exposures above the new
limits, the Labor Department
said in completing a two-year
project that represents the first
large-scale changes to exposure
standards in nearly two decades.
Employers have until September
to comply.

OSHA estimated that in addi-
tion to preventing about 700
deaths a year, the tighter limits
should prevent 55,000 illnesses
and 500,000 lost workdays each
year attributed to workplace
exposure to hazardous and toxic
materials.

The reductions in maximum-
exposure limits cover some of the
most commonly used industrial
materials and byproducts, includ—
ing acetone, carbon monoxide,
carbon disulﬁde, chloroform, hy-
drogen cyanide, perchloroethy—
lene and styrene. ‘

Substances regulated for the

first time include wood dust and
grain dust, acrylic acid, butane,
gasoline, paraffin wax fumes,
tungsten and welding fumes.

The limits cover the maximum
amount of a substance a worker
can be exposed to during an
eight—hour workday.

The changes announced Friday
could cost employers on average
$6,000 a year for each affected
workplace, though that would
vary greatly, the government
said.

Costs could range from $77,400
a year for petroleum reﬁneries to
$360 annually for auto dealers.
The average per—worker cost is
$150. ‘

The department considered
limits for more than 400 indus—
trial chemicals and substances in
a single review, departing from a
policy of case—by—case study that
had produced new, comprehen-
sive standards for just 24 sub—
stances in 17 years.

After the review, the govern-
ment decided to keep existing
limits on 52 substances.

The new limits on the others
take effect March 1 and employ-
ers must be in compliance by
Sept. 1..

Exposure limits will remain
unchanged for 169 additional
substances not covered by the
two—year review.

Some of them are being re-
viewed on an individual basis.

The new standards apply only
to general industry but will be ex—
tended, after additional proceed—
ings, to construction and
maritime industries as well.

Wildlife can become dependent on us

HM? Mo. LH-

Winter proves to be hard on wildlife
because there isn’t an abundance of
food. Many people try to be good Sa-
maritans and feed these animals, but
it’s not recommended unless it can be
done consistently until natural food is
available in the spring. However, if you
insist on feeding the wildlife, there are
a few things you need to know.

First of all, it is important that you
continue feeding through the winter
because the animals and birds will be—
come dependent on you for food. Don’t
feed them just through the coldest part
of winter and forget them the rest of
the time.

Food should be provided regularly
and in the same amount each day. Try
to use food that is nutritious, such as
fodder corn for deer and a treat of eggs
for both skunks and raccoons. If there
are deer in your area it is usually a bad
idea to feed them unless the winter is
, extremely severe. They can usually
ﬁnd their own food and really are bet-
ter off not depending on you.

Bird feeding seems to be a national
craze and what a great pastime it is.
There are many types of bird feeders
and wild—bird food available. Sunﬂower
seeds and peanut butter are very good

for wild birds, helping them sustain se—
vere winter weather. Here again, the
feeding must be consistent. The birds
will suffer if you change their diet to
stale white bread.

Don’t forget to make sure water is
available at all times and be sure to
change the water frequently and make
sure it’s in a protected area where it
won’t freeze quickly.

You will notice that when you start
feeding a few animals and birds, many
more will be attracted to your feeding
station and you may be inclined to put
out more and more food. After a
month or so of this you may notice
your grocery bill can’t bear the additio-
nal burden. Not only are you stuck but
so are the animals.

I know it’s hard to resist feeding ani—
mals and birds, but before you start,
make sure you will be there all winter
and that you can afford to buy the food
for the entire season. 'It sure is worth
the effort to spend a little each week.

SAN FRANCISCO —— Up to a
third of those who contract non-

‘We ’re very much
like New Jersey in
Louisiana, yet we
operate at about 50
percent (Of the) level
of their environ-

l La. needs to beef up
environment effort,

By ZACK NAUTH
Capital bureau

 

PORT ALLEN, La. ——-
1 Louisiana is making progress on
‘ cleaning up the environment but
still has a long way to go before it
reaches the level of comparable
industrial states, the state’s envi-
ronmental chief, Paul Templet,
said Monday.

Templet said the state is lag-
ging in the amount of money it
spends on protecting the environ-
ment even though it produces
one—fourth of the nation’s chemi—
cals and abounds with oil and gas
exploration and production.

“We’re very much like New
Jersey in Louisiana, yet we oper-
ate at about 50 percent (of the)
level of their environmental pro—
grams,” Templet told the Baton
Rouge Press Club. “Fifty percent
in terms of funding, 50 percent in
terms of people. The governor
knows this. So I’m pushing us in
the direction of doubling the size
of the DEQ, doubling the size of
the people, doubling the size of

{ the money.”

The Department of Environ-

mental Quality received $50 mil-
lion this year, up from about $25
million in 1987—88. The current
ﬁgure includes $5 million from
the state general fund, compared.
with no general fund aid in 1987 -
88. The balance of the depart-
ment’s money comes from federal
grants and industry fees and
ﬁnes.

Templet wants to increase the
budget to $63 million in the ﬁscal
year beginning July 1, by asking
the Legislature to boost general
fund aid to $15 million.

“This is a hard time to get
state general funds but if you
heard the governor last night he
said he was going to put some
more flesh on the bones at
DEQ,” Templet said, referring to
Gov. Roemer’s Sunday night
speech on statewide television.

“This is an interesting time in
the environmental history of
Louisiana and the country,”
Templet said. “More and more
we are running into environmen—
tal limits to the things we want
to do. . .. The greenhouse effect,
the sea level is rising, the weather

is changing, acid rain is killing
forests all over the world. . . .
Industries are unable to locate in
Louisiana because of pollution.

“No longer will our quality of
life be determined by those eco-
nomic things only, but increas—
ingly it will be how we treat our
environment that Lwill determine
the quality of life for us and our
Children.”

Industry is one of the big bar-
riers to increased ﬁnancing and
tough environmental legislation,
Templet acknowledged. Business
and industry groups succeeded in
removing $2.5 million that was in
DEQ’s budget for local environ—
mental programs, while oil and
gas lobbyists blocked a pipeline
tax that would have raised money
to ﬁght coastal erosion. Industry
also argues against stricter regu-
lations.

“,VVhat I heard from industry
was kind of a fear,” Templet said

i of the opposition to local pro—-

grams. “Sometimes people react
from visceral feelings rather than.
intellectual feelings. Some fear

‘5 that somehow having local gov~

ernment involved in environmen—

tal programs will make it worse

for some. other sector.”

As for the pipeline tax,
Templet said: “Some segment of
the industry which is going to be
affected by increased costs will
fight those costs. I think that’s
clear.”

Templet also cited the failure
of a bottle bill, which would have
required deposits on beverage
containers to encourage return

. and recycling. Several states op—

erate under a similar law.

“The bottlers will guarantee to
put 2 to 3 million (dollars) in an
opposition effort to kill our bill.”

. While the state is cracking down
1 on companies that exceed limits
; on discharges of pollution into

the air, water and land,'it still has
a long way to go on the larger
and more difﬁcult problem of re—

'= ducing emissions that some

age cancer rates, Templet said.

which should reduce discharges

rl‘he more researchers study
estrogen, the female sex hor-

‘mone, the more they find them-

? selves dancing around points and

 

cminterpoints.

Estrogen can promote the
growth of breast cancer. But it
protects against heart disease. It
contributes to cancer of the lin~
ing of the uterus. But it prevents
osteoporosis, the crippling bone
disease. Specialists inevitably
ﬁnd their views of estrogen col-
ored by their medical interests.

“The truth is, there’s more
than 'one way of looking at the
thing,” said Drﬁljjl‘orence Hasel-
tine, director of the Centéijwfpr
Population Research at theﬂNa~

tional Institute of Childﬂﬂealth
aﬁa'iHufm‘aa‘iDseepsteamer-
tﬁésda, Md. “we each have our
own perspective.”

Concern over the effects of
estrogen has heightened in recent
weeks as three studies suggested
that birth control pills, which
contain estrogen, might increase
women’s risk of developing breast
cancer.

Millions of women take
estrogen in one form or another.
Eighty percent of American
women are taking or have taken
birth control pills, and 10 percent
of women are put on lifelong

 

‘ estrogen therapy after meno-

' pause to alleviate hot ﬂashes and

forestall bone loss.

vuué

Birth control pills I .: differ—
ent formulations of synthetic
estrogen than estrogen prescribed
after menopause. Both are che-
mically different from natural
estrogen. which could not be
taken as a pill because it is
broken down by the digestive
tract.

What effects, if any, these ”dif-
ferent estrogen formulas have on
the risks of cancer and other dis—
eases is unclear.

But, said Drglrpuiseﬁrinton of
th e N a t 19 I1_,é1.l___.QIoLD.C..eL_lnS‘Li 1; u t e,
“there’s probably need for more
caution,” among doctors who
prescribe birth control pills and
who prescribe estrogen to women
after menopause.

When girls reach puberty,
around 11., their ovaries begin
churning out estrogen, which
makes their breasts, uterus and
vagina grow, makes their sweat
glands develop, and causes the
growth of a layer of fat under
their skin. At the same time,
their bones grow and the girls
grow taller.

At menopause, which usually
occurs around 50, the ovaries
stop making estrogen, and wom-
en’s only source of the hormone
is from another hormone,
androstene dione, which is made
by the adrenal glands.

Enzymes in other tissues, par—
ticularly fat tissue, convert this
hormone into estrogen. For this
reason, overweight women pro~
duce more estrogen after meno-

pause. But menopause leaves
every woman with lower estrogen
levels than she ever had since pu-
berty.

When women menstruate,

their estrogen levels vary cy-
clically from a low of 40 pi-
cograms per milliliter of blood in
the four or ﬁve days before men-
struation to a high of 250 to 300
picograms per milliliter at ovu-
lation, said Dr. Waynejiagdin of g
the Population Council in New
York. N. MM- -__
”"A‘fter menopause, a woman’s
estrogen level is stable at 10 to 40
picograms per milliliter of blood
and the average level is 20 pi~
cograms, Bardin said.

In the past 20 years most gyne—
cologists and endocrinologists
have prescribed estrogen to some
women at menopause to prevent
health problems and discomfort
that can occur from a lack of
estrogen.

Experts said most menopausal
women have hot flashes, which
can range from barely noticeable
to intolerable.

The decline of estrogen at
menopause can cause the walls of
the vagina to become thinner and
more difficult to lubricate, Dr.
Haseltine said, and it can take ,
women longer to reach an
orgasm.

But, she said, “although some
women are very bothered by
menopause, other women have
absolutely no problems going
through it.”

Scientists have discovered the
structure of a substance that is a
key to allergic reactions, and they
expect to use the knowledge soon
in searching for new treatments
for these widespread and varied
forms of illness.

The substance being studied is
the cell surface receptor to which
antibodies bind in a crucial, early
stage of most allergic reactions.

The scientists expect their re-
search to make possible a search
for drugs that would halt allergic
reactions by blocking the func-
tions of the receptor.

Such blocking agents could
halt an allergic reaction as it was
beginning, regardless of the sub-
stance to which the patient was
allergic.

Most current treatment
involves drugs that attempt to
desensitize a person to a specific
cause of an allergy.

“We believe this is a landmark
accomplishment in allergy re-
search,” said Dr. Henry Metzger,
leader of the résearch team. T

He is scientiﬁc director of the

 

National Institut Wis,
Wnd Skin Dis-
eases, a unit of thew National
SEQEQEES,2f..-H§.QLLh.iILB§LheSda,

-.._....————-—————... .

 

A crucial next step in the re-
search will be to induce cells to
make a hybrid receptor in which
the surface attachment portion of
the protein will be that of a
human receptor.

Kinet said researchers hope to
achieve this “in a matter of
weeks.”

Cells that have the human re-
ceptor on their surfaces could be
used in tests to seek drugs that
would block the receptor or me
vent the mast cells from releasing
their powerful and destructive
chemicals.

If successful, this blocking
might halt anlallergic reaction
early, before the painful symp—
toms had a chance to develop.

The discovery of such recep—
tor-blocking or inhibiting drugs
“could yield enormous thera—
peutic benefits,” said the report
in Nature.

“This research should beneﬁt
many ﬁelds of clinical immuno-
logy besides allergy research,”
said Dr. Lawrence E. Shuirnan,
director of. the arthritis institute.

 

 

lmmunoglobulin E represents
only one class of these immune
defense substances. The scien-
tists expect that knowledge of the
lgE receptor’s structure would be
useful in studying the functioning
of other antibodies.

 

The receptor studied by
Metzger and his colleagues is a
protein made up of three parts.
Two parts were previously dis-
covered, but were found to be
inactive by themselves.

The government scientists, led
by Metzger and Dr. Jean-Pierre
Kinet of the institute, identiﬁed
the gene for the third component
of the receptor and demonstrated
that the three parts together
functioned in cells.

The researchers’ work involved
receptors native to rat cells. Such
receptors, in humans as well as
rodents, are key to the process in
which immune defense cells re-
spond to a foreign substance,
unleashing an allergic reaction.

Such an allergic reaction is a
complex process in which a for—
eign substance enters the body
and is sought out by a particular
class of antibodies called immu—
noglobulin E, or IgE.

These attach to the foreign
substance and also attach to re-
ceptors on immune defense cells
called mast cells.

When the attachment is 00111;

pleted between the foreign sub-
stance, the antibodies and the
receptors on the surface of the
mast cells, the cells seem almost
to explode. .

This reaction releases hista-
mine and other substances that
relax blood vessels and make
them leaky, and can produce all
the familiar symptoms of allergy,
including skin eruptions, sneez—
ing, itching, runny noses and wa—
tery eyes.

In a report published recently
in Nature, the scientists said they
transferred the genes for all three
parts of the receptor into monkey
cells that do not natura y ave
the receptor.

The cells then produced the .re-
ceptor and these antibodies
attached to it. The accomplish—
ment culminates 1.6 years of re-
search, the scientists said.

iii—Sm the viewpoint of human
allergy treatment, the crucial part
of the receptor is the portion that
sticks out of the cell surface giv—
ing the antibody a place. to attach
to the cell and activate its chemi-
cal functions.

gy—pI'OIl

New scientific findings should help the allergy
sufferer breathe easier soon.

As the annual Christmas Seal
Campaign draws to a close, I
would like to thank your paper
for the help and support over the
past year with our programs and
objectives -— help by reporting
our activities and work, support
by endorsing our fund-raising
campaign to help us continue our
work to control and reduce lung
disease in Louisiana.

For more than 80 years of
service in the community we
have been working to improve
the public’s health. Tuberculosis,
while somewhat under control,
has yet to be eradicated. Our
environment is improving, but air
pollution problems persist both
outdoors and inside. Although
the rates of smoking are slowly
declining, the victims of lung dis-
eases continue to escalate.

Donations to Christmas Seals
help finance our programs to
reach the long—sought goal of a
society free from TB, make the
air we breath clean and healthy,
and implement education and
prevention programs to reduce
the rates of emphysema, asthma,
pneumonia and inﬂuenza.

To the many who have do—
nated to our campaign, we extend
our many thanks. To those who
may have forgotten us during the
holidays, we hope you’ll be able
to contribute to our cause. It’s a
matter of life and breath.

A recent workshop on cephalopods
(octopuses and the like) shows the

continuing usefulness of systematics

Perhaps the most long-lasting and fun‘
damental of the research commitments
of curators at our National Museum of
Natural History is for the systematic
identiﬁcation and classification of animal
and plant species in its enormous collec—
tions. How and why this is carried out is
illustrated by the International Work-
shop in Systematics and Zoogeography
of Cephalopods recently held at the
museum. Its title probably does not strike
you as having been calculated to arouse
enormous public interest, and indeed
that never was the intention. Attendance,
although drawn from 12 countries, ex-
tended over a fortnight of long, daily
sessions and was limited to some 35 spe-
cialists on squid, octopuses, cuttleﬁsh and
chambered nautiluses. Equally daunting
to any casual visitor would have been the
intensive examinations of thousands of
specimens accumulated for the event.
But by eliminating duplicate and inad-
equately supported identiﬁcations, the
workshop had the vital function of
bringing additional order and insight to
an insufﬁciently understood class of
mollusks of growing importance.

Progress is sometimes made in re-
verse. The consensus was that a total of
101 species of common shallow-water oc-
topuses survived this winnowing process
—~about three-ﬁfths of the number rec-
ognized at the workshop’s beginning.
The research was done on the 7 families
having the most species, leaving about
30 families still waiting for such inten-
s1ve treatment.

onlhgman. But they are fascinating
creatures in their own right: large,
highly evolved, aggressive and fast-
swimming, they are near the top of the
food pyramid as predatory adults. That
means they are also exasperatingly suc-
cessful at net-avoidance; as one author-
ity ruefully observes, “We catch only the
slow, the sick and the stupid.” Their
complex repertoire of deceptive, goal-
directed behavior bears comparison
with that of many predatory vertebrates
(Horizons, October 1986), and encour-

ages exper1ments on learning, short- @direction—commercial,

and long- -term memory, and reactions
to mreWards andupuﬁ1shments.Yet they
are also, at all ages, major prey of ﬁshes
like sharks and tuna, of dolphins,
toothed whales, seals and seabirds. It is
estimated that sperm me-
nuall consume 50 million tons of them
in the Southern Hemisphere— equiva-

current annual ﬁsheries production.

Given their highly developed central
nervous system, cephalopods are useful
in many ex erimental__s)tudies. The
squid’s giant axon or nerve, largest in
diameter in the animal kingdom, is
much in demand for neurophysiological
studies, including those related to human
spinal injuries. They are of great promise
as sources for biologically active sub-
stances, including antishock, anesthetic
and antiparasitic drugs, and powerful

toxins. And most of the cephalopods

have high nutritional qualities, extremely
rapid rates of growth and short life
spans, making them attractive subjects
for aquaculture (cultivation within artiﬁ-
cial enclosures). This possibility looms
in importance as the ﬁrst signs of a
depletion of natural stocks are begin-
ning to accompany their heavy exploita-
tion as food in some societies.

Seven-year-old Rona Craddock of West Palm Beach uses a baby bottle
to feed two kids at Dreher Park Zoo’s petting zoo.

etrozoo may have

wings, claws, paws

and all that. But it also

has million-dollar ex-

, hibits with meats and

barriers and remote islands (at least

they seem that way) to keep the beasts

of the wild far from the beasts of civili-
zation, and vice versa.

That’s great for folks who want to
look at nature’s wonder from a dis-
tance, but not for those hoping to use
their other senses —— namely touch.

Luckily for them, there’s the petting

L 200, where the point is to get up close

and personal with the animals you’ve
come to see.

Petting zoos may not have the animal
variety of a Metrozoo (its small petting
zoo is closed for the next six months for
renovations) or the fancy surroundings
complete with airuconditioned mono-
rails. But you don’t need them because
at these smaller, easier—to-breeze-
through places, you’re there to com-
mune with nature (not commute above
it), sometimes with 3 ba g of feed in your

‘ hand and usually with a sense of wonder

in your child’s eyes.

Although designed for children, pet-
ting _zoos are of interest to anyone who
likes to be around animals. But with the
exception of a llama or two, don’t ex-

' pect much more than farm animals (at

least if you plan on coming home with
all your fingers).

gull, it’s a great way to spend an hour
or two, usually without spending a lot.

“This is very educational,” said Paul
Coty, 24, a visitor from Ottawa, Canada,
who Spent a recent afternoon at the pet-
ting 200 at Flamingo Gardens’ Gator-
world Zoo. “I’m in the poultry business
and would you believe it? I’ve never
seen a chicken with its feathers. When
we get them, they’re ready to be proc-
essed —— and in no condition to be pet-
ted.”

There’s more to do at the area’s pet-
ting zoos than pet animals. Other Kinds
of exhibits and displays are corlmOD,
and some are part of larger pavﬁs that
offer additional attractions.

 




I reher Park Zoo

The petting zoo is open about two
hours a day —— but sometimes not at all,
depending on the whims of zoo officials
and the baby animals. “The babies get
tired too quickly,” explains a zoo em-
ployee, “and can’t handle all the atten-
tion they get at the petting zoo.”

Included at the petting zoo are a lla-
ma, a Shetland pony, a donkey, and sev-
eral goats, lambs and other farm ani-
mals — about a dozen beasts in all.
Each is gentle, making a worry-free
visit for young children on their first an-
imal outing. -

Even when the petting zoo is closed,
however, there’s still plenty of petting
to be done. With the exception of a few
animals, most of the 200’s residents can

CONSERVATIONISTS'

TO BACK DUKAKIS

 

National-Coalition of Groups,
Faulting Record of Bush,
Vow to Help Democrat

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

Special to The New York Times '

WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 —— Rejecting
Vice President Bush’s recent assertion
that he is an environmentalist, the
political arm of the nation’s major con-
servation groups will‘ endorse the
Presidential candidacy of'Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.

The executive director of the League
of Conservation Voters said today that
the group’s directors believed the
Democratic nominee would better
serve the environmental needs of the
country. The group’s directors voted on
the endorsement Friday but the league
has not officially announced its deci-
sion.

The executive director, Jim Maddy,
said the organization’s review of the
candidates’ records established no rea-
son to change the league’s previous as— .
sessments of the two candidates. The;
league previously gave Mr. Bush a “D” t
grade and Mr. Dukakis a “B” for theiri
leadership on environmental issues. '

 

Individual Support for Bush

“The decision was based on an objec-
tive, honest, bipartisan appraisal of the
records of both candidates,” Mr.l
Maddy said. He added, “Not to have en-;,
dorsed M r. Dukakis would have been to:
reward Vice President Bush for a poor“
environmental record and punish Gov-
ernor Dukakis for a good record.”

Some individual conservationists
have announced their support for the
Vice President. Three former environ-
mental oi‘t‘icials in Republican adminis-
trations have formed a committee of
conservationists to advise Mr. Bush.
They are William D. Ruckelshaus and
Russell E. Train, who were Adminis-
trators of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, and Nathaniel Reed, who
was an Assistant Secretary of the In-
terior.

Interior Secreiary Donald P. Hodel
criticized the environ'mentalists’ en-
dorsement decision as “totally and ab-
solutely predictable.”

“The environ mentalists have been in
the pocket of the Democratic national
party since they signed on with Jimmy
Carter and opposed Ronald Reagan in
1980,“ Mr. Hodel said. “Most Amer-
icans support balanced and res'posive
environmental programs, a fact that is
lost on these people who, in some cases,
have made their organization into par-
tisanorganizations.”

Partisanship Denied

Mr. Maddy insisted that his group
was strictly nonpartisan and said that
it was backing’ many Republicans in
this year’s Congressional elections. He
noted it is giving its highest Congres-
sional priority to the re-election of

 

Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of
Rhode Island. , ' ‘
“The country cannot afford to lose

3 John Chafee — he is too important for
the environment,” Mr. Maddy said.

, Mr. Maddy said environmentalists’
support could be decisive in crucial
swing states like California'a'nd New
Jersey, where voters have demon-
strated a concern over pollution issues.
He added that the endorsement
means that millions of members of en-
vironmental organizations would be
notified that Mr. Dukakis is the candi-
date to support. He also said environ-
mentalists would be doing door-to-door
canvassing and placing advertise-
ments for the Democratic candidate.

 

, One national environmental group,
IF riends of the Earth, also decided to
lendorse Mr. Dukakis as an individual
3 group. Alan Gussow, president of the
iorganization, said the decision was
based on the fact that “Mike Dukakis
has a good environmental record and
George Bush does not.”

Bush’s Actions Assailed

“For the last last eight years,” Mr.
Gussow said, “the Reagan-Bush Ad-
ministration told the oil and coal com-
panies to help themselves to the public
lands, cut the environmental protection
budget s and stopped enforcing environ-
mental laws. Where on earth was Bush
when the environmentneeded him? In
charge of the campaign to deregulate
environmental controls, that’s where.”

Another organization, Environmen-
tal Victory, made up of more than a
thousand professionals and scholars in
the environmental field in New York
State, announced today that they would
endorse Mr. Dukakis at a news confer-
ence Thursday morning.

Mr. Bush sought to seiZt. the initia-

tive on the environmental issue in a

series of speeches two weeks ago in
which he described himself as an envi-
ronmentalist, promised specific ac-
tions, including a program to curb acid
rain, and said pollution in Boston Har-
bor shoWed that MI. Dukakis had ques-
tionable environmental credentials.

THE WASHING’MNPOST DEPIEMBER I. 1915'

Bush Vows to Fight Pollution,
Install ‘Conservation Ethic9
Speech Distances Candidate From Reagan

 

By Bill Peterson

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

DETROIT, Aug. 31—Republican
presidential nominee George Bush,
attempting to separate himself from
President Reagan on environmental
issues, said today that if he is
elected he will work to reduce acid
rain, speed the cleanup of toxic

- wastes, beef up enforcement of fed-

eral pollution regulations and bring
a new “conservation ethic” to the
White House.

Declaring “I am an environmen-
talist,” Bush said he would end
ocean dumping by 1991, set a goal
of “no net loss of wetlands,” prevent
offshore oil drilling in sensitive ar-
eas and call an international confer-
ence to discuss global warming and
ozone depletion during his first year
in office.

He also pledged to appoint “the
most qualified individuals in the
land” to run the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency and to expand the
National Park System. Bush provid-
ed no details on where new money
would come from to pay for park
expansion or his other proposals.

The speech, delivered before a
group of conservationists gathered
on the shores of Lake Erie about 25
miles south of here, was Bush’s
most comprehensive statement on
the environment, and put him at
odds with Reagan administration
policy on a number of issues—in-
cluding acid rain and toxic-waste
cleanup.

Bush didn’t mention Reagan by

name, and he refused to character-
ize his positions as being tougher
than those of the president. “These
are George Bush’s policies,” he told
reporters. “This is what I’ll do when
I’m elected president.”

Bush adviser Russell Train, a
former head of EPA, wasn’t so cau-
tious. “It’s a whole new ball game,”
he said. “It comes through in the
ﬂavor of the speech, and the com-
mitment. It’s a refreshing, long
overdue, change.”

The environment “hasn’t had a
high priority” for Reagan, said
5T rain, chairman of the World Wild-
life Fund and the Conservation
Foundation. .

In Boston, Democratic presiden-
tial nominee Michael S. Dukakis
scoffed at Bush’s remarks, accusing
the vice president of a “last-minute
conversion” to environmental pro-
tection after seven years of “inac-
tion” in the Reagan administration.
[Details on Page A16.]

The volleying over the environ-
ment came as a new Washington
Post-ABC News poll suggests the
presidential race is dead even head-
ing into the Labor Day weekend.
The poll of 1,129 likely voters con-
ducted Aug. 24-30 showed Dukakis
with 48 percent and Bush 47 per-
cent. That was virtually unchanged
from last week’s result, which
showed Bush with 48 percent and
Dukakis with 46 percent. The polls
had a margin of sampling error of
pIUs or minus 3 percentage points.

(over)

 




(continued)

Bush’s speech today was de-
signed to increase his appeal to po-
litical .moderates—especially in
such key battle-ground states as
Oregon, Washington, California and
New Jersey—and lay the ground-
work for a round of attacks in up-
coming days on Dukakis’ record on
the environment as governor of
Massachusetts.

“He has a lot of excess baggage
on the environment,” said Mark
Goodin, a Bush deputy press sec-
retary. “I think by the time it is all
over and done with Michael Duka-
kis will be a lot more vulnerable
than he is today."

On Thursday, Bush plans on tak-
ing his attack on Dukakis’ environ-
mental record to the governor’s
back yard—Deer Island in Boston
Harbor. Attempts to clean up the
sludge-clogged harbor have
dragged on for years, and federal
officials say Boston is far behind
other port cities in its efforts.

Bush strategists believe that the

harbor cleanup provides an ideal ,

opening to challenge Dukakis, who
recently broke ground for a new
waste treatment plant there. “Ev-
ery day, 2,300 pounds of toxic

wastes and 70 tons of sludge are ‘

added to the cesspool the governor
has created out of Boston Harbor,"
one Bush campaign source said.

The Reagan administration has
long been a target of environmental
groups for what they say has been
its general neglect of the environ-
, ment and lax regulation of industrial
polluters.

Under Reagan, the EPA has been
blamed first for politicizing the se-
lection of sites for toxic waste
cleanups, then for squandering bil-
lions of dollars on “band-aid" rem-
edies that resulted in only a handful
of completed cleanups in several
years; failing to meet congres-
sionally deadlines on regulation of
water and air pollution; and resist-
ing efforts to control acid rain.

“The past eight years have
brought many delays, some actual
backsliding and a myriad of missed
opportunities to protect human
health and the environment,” said
Jessica Landman of the Natural Re-
sources Defense Council.

Bush campaign officials acknowl-
edge they could have trouble estab-
lishing credibility on environmental
issues. “We’re a little behind the
'curve on it in terms of public per-
ception," Goodin said.

Bush’s speech today was laced
with specific proposals and tough-
sounding rhetoric. The EPA, Bush
sald. should use its authority to sue
toxic-waste polluters for triple dam~
ages. “Those who are responsible

for the dumping should be respon-
sible for the cleanup. Polluters
should pay,” he said.

Bush indirectly criticized the ad-
ministration on toxic-waste cleanup,
noting that the Superfund program
“has the money. But we can use it
faster and more efficiently. We can

’make greater use of the EPA's

emergency authority to step in and
clean up immediately.”

Although the Superfund program
is flush with more than $9 billion
through 1992, its funding was ap-
proved by Congress in 1986 over
the objections of the administration,
which sought about half as much.

Superfund has been criticized for
its slow response to toxic-waste
problems, its reliance on short-term
fixes rather than the permanent
remedies favored by Congress and
its light treatment of toxic-waste
dumpers. Fines have averaged less
than 10 percent of the money that
polluters have saved by illegal
dumping of wastes, according to
Hugh Kaufman of the EPA’s haz-
ardous site control division.

On acid rain, Bush said that the
“time for study alone has passed."
He said he would cut “millions of
tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by
the year 2000, and to significantly
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions.”

In the past, Reagan has questioned
the overwhelming scientific evidence
that acid rain is caused by sulfur di-
oxide and nitrogen oxides, and called
for more study of the problem. He
has consistently opposed legislative
efforts to cut back emissions of the
two pollutants, which transform in
the atmosphere and come down as
acid rain and snow.

The administration's failure has
strained U.S. relations with Canada,
where lakes and forests have been
damaged by acid rain originating in
the American Midwest. Bush was
sent to Ottawa in January 1987 to
appease Prime Minister Brian Mul-
roney, whose popularity was sag-
ging because of his failure to obtain
acid-rain concessions from the ad-
ministration.

On water pollution, Bush called
for a policy of “zero tolerance .
not only to those who poison our
children’s minds with drugs, but to
those who poison our water with
toxic chemicals."

The administration has been less
forceful on this issue, failing to
meet congressionally imposed dead-
lines for regulating pesticide and
toxic-chemical discharges, control-
ling toxic chemicals in 'sewage
sludge and ending ocean dumping.

In January 1987, Reagan vetoed
legislation providing $20 billion to
clean up US. waterways, calling
the measure too expensive and too
dependent on federal funding. Con-
gress overrode the veto, releasing

Italy one $1 Billion for

Venice Lagoon Cleanup

From Reuters

I VENICE—The Italian govern-
ment Monday set aside $1.1 billion
to clean up the Venice lagoon.

The money will be spent over the
next two years on various projects
aimed at restoring the lagoon's
fragile ecology, on which the long-
term survival of the 1,000—year-old
canal city depends.

Thousands of tons of untreated
chemicals and detergents seep into
the lagoon each year from farm-
lands and factories, providing a rich
breeding ground for algae, which
kills off the fish.

3 Galilee Fishermen ,
Suspected of Using

Poison for Easy Catch

JERUSALEM (All—Thousands of
dead fish were found floating in the
Jordan River, possibly poisoned by
fishermen on the Sea of Galilee
looking for an easy catch, an
official said Friday.

“We suspect large-scale poison-
ing using agricultural pesticides,"
said Elad Zohar, an Israeli area
supervisor.

Zohar said the pesticides appar-
ently were dumped in the Sea of
Galilee and killed more fish than
the fishermen could catch. Thou-
sands of the poisoned fish then
floated from the fresh water lake
into the narrow, winding Jordan
River, he said.

“The damage caused by the
poisoning is very great," Zohar
said. “For every fish caught, three
others are rotting and washing
ashore.”

In addition, those caught still
carry the poison in their systems.
Israel Radio broadcast a warning,
saying fresh water fish should not
be eaten.

Zohar blamed the poisoning on
“marginal elements" among the
Sea of Galilee’s 180 commercial
fishermen-

Blockages in wombs and fallopian tubes
were evident in Baltic seals as well as in
some mammals in the area of the Skagerrak
and Kattegat. Reijnders believes the block-
ages were caused by scarring after the seals
miscarried embryos. He suggests PCBs
suppress the hormones oestradiol and
progesterone, leading to miscarriages. Since
the endocrine system also governs immune
respone, Reijnders suggests there may be a
link in this evidence.

The report noted that high levels of PCBs
appear to affect reproduction in seals but
not in other wildlife. In an experiment
carried out on the Isle of May, Scotland,
artiﬁcially raised levels of PCBs in pufﬁns
showed no effects either on breeding
success or on longevity.

latest estimates from very incomplete
data suggest around 3.3 tonnes of PCBs
empty into the North Sea every year, half
from the river Weser. Much of it also comes
from the Ems, the Elbe and the Rhine.
Incineration of the materials at high
temperatures is the only safe way to dispose
of them, but it will take many years to
destroy the whole stockpile.

Last November, the states bordering the
North Sea agreed to introduce measures to
halve the input of pesticides and PCBs into
the sea within seven years. Even if PCBs, or
other pollutants, are shown to weaken the
seals to the point where they fall ill and die,
new controls will do little to ease the effects
on wildlife caused by existing pollution.
PCBs remain unchanged in the environ-
ment for decades, perhaps longer.

Scientists participating in the North Sea
project still do not know why the seals

should suddenly have become ill. Accord- ‘
ing to marine ecologists in Texel, the bloom ‘

of poisonous algae off Norway in May
could have been related to the heavy rains
and warmth of the past winter, which
increased the load of organic nutrients in
the North Sea.

But there is no clear evidence that algae
increase the speed at which PCBs reach the
food chain. The pollutants attach them—
selves to tiny grains in the sea bed such as
clay and are released when animals or
currents disturb them. ' [j

 

THE NEW YORK TIMES

Canine Virus Tied to seat ea 3

 

By STEVE LOHR

 

Special to The New York Times

LONDON, Aug. 29 — A team of
Dutch scientists ‘ announced today
that they had identified an animal
virus‘ that more commonly infects
dogs-as the cause of the puzzling epi-
demic that has killed more than 7,000
seals this year in. the North Sea and.
the Baltic.

The Dutch researchers, led by Dr.
Albert Osterhaus, a veterinary virolo-
gist at Holland’s National Institute of
Public Health and Environmental
Protection, have also developed a
vaccine in conjunction ‘With Swedish
scientists to combat the virus, canine
distemper virus.

“But it’s no cure,” Dr. Osterhaus
said in a telephone interview. “It will
be effective only in animals that have
not yet been infected.”

Moreover, wildlife specialists and
veterinarians caution that it would be
virtuall impossible to vaccinate
much 0 the healthy seal population in
the North Sea. Healthy seals are very
difficult to trap for inoculation and,
they add, extensive use of a vaccine
on animals could have unforeseen ef-
fects on other species in their food
chain.

So the new vaccine, developed with
the aid of Dr. Bror Morein of the Uni-

Although a vaccine
has been developed, '
experts say it will be
of limited use.

 

versity of Uppsala in Sweden, will be
administered mainly to animals in
sanctuaries to replenish the seal
population. To date, 50 doses of the
vaccine have been administered to
animals at a seal sanctuary in Pieter-
buren, the Netherlands, Dr. Oster-
haus said.

The identity of the virus behind the
epidemic was a surprise. Veterinary
experts, including Dr. Osterhaus, at
first suspected herpes and picorna vi-
ruses, having found them in some dis-
eased seals. But subsequent tests
found that antibodies to those viruses
were present in a comparatively
small proportion of infected seals.

The suggestion to look for canine
distemper virus came from Dr. An-
ders Bergman, a Swedish veterinary
pathologist, one of several foreign
specialists with whom the Dutch
team was cooperating. “It was clear
the disease picture was exactly the

same as in dogs,” Dr. Bergman said
today in Stockholm. -

The disease, apparently transmit-
ted through coughing, displays «many
of the same symptoms in seals as. in
dogs: watering eyes, thick nasal dis;
charge, inflamation of the lungs, liver

‘ and intestines, and lesions in the

nervous system. .

The Dutch group has led an inter-
national effort against the deadly epi-
demic. Blood samples have been
taken from hundreds of seals in the
Netherlands, West Germany,
Sweden, Denmark and Britain, be«
fore, during and after the animals
contracted the disease. The results
showed. that virtually all the diseased
animals had developed antibodies to

- the canine distemper virus. Dr. Os-

terhaus said that seals tested in . ~
previous years in the. North Sea did
not possess those antibodies.

Dr. Osterhaus said seal blood-
serum samples from Greenland indi-
cated that the animals there might
have been the first to contract the dis-
ease, probably from dogs. It is highly
unlikely that humans could get the
disease, he added. . .

The Dutch research will be pub
lished Thursday in the British journal
Nature.

Still unclear is the part, if any, that
pollution may have played in the seal
epidemic. .

Distemper found

in Soviet seals in April

OVIET scientists identiﬁed canine
distemper ﬁve months ago as the cause
of a mysterious illness among seals in Lake
Baikal. The symptoms were identical to
those found among seals dying of the
disease in the North Sea this summer. But
because European investigators did not
know about the Soviet outbreak, they lost
valuable weeks in identifying it.

The disease has killed around a thousand
Baikal seals, Phoco siberica, the only fresh-
water seals in the world. Symptoms
included congestion, coughing, a yellow-
green discharge from the eyes and event-
ually total paralysis from the neck down. In
April, scientists at the Limnological Insti-
tute and the Institute of Toxicology on
Lake Baikal, identified the cause of the
illness as a virus responsible for both
human measles and canine distemper.

Like their European counterparts,
scientists at Lake Baikal have attempted to
link the outbreak of the disease with pollu-
tion of the Siberian lake, the largest expanse
of fresh water in the world. There has been
concern about local pollution from cellu-
lose and pulp plants on the lake.

John Harwood, of the British Sea
Mammal Research Unit, believes it is
unlikely that Lake Baikal could have been
the source of the virus that reached the

 

months ago and for which £500 000 had
already been earmarked.

Canine distemper spreads rapidly and
kills a high proportion of animals that have
not been exposed to it before. It could have
been spread by dogs biting seals or cough-
ing on them, according to Osterhaus, but
there is no evidence for this yet.

The virus suppresses the immune system
of animals by attacking their white blood
cells. However, animals whose immune
systems are already suppressed are most
susceptible to the disease, according to
John Baker, a veterinary pathologist at
Liverpool University.

Scientists believe that the seals transmit
the disease directly from one to another on
droplets when sneezing or coughing.
Harwood says that the illness changes the
behaviour of common seals, who swim to
places that they do not normally visit.

A common seal regularly travels about
50 kilometres a day in search of food. The
infection that has so far reached the
common seals in the Wash on the east coast
of England may, therefore, have spread to
the colonies on the Tay and the Moray
Firth in Scotland. Reports of dead
common seals in the Orkneys were coming
in last week. More dead seals of both
species have washed ashore all around
Britain, including 38 on the shores of the
Irish Sea. However, scientists have only
conﬁrmed distemper in seals from the
Wash. A spokeswoman for the Sea
Mammal Research Unit said the other
deaths could be unconnected with the
disease.

Harwood says that a colony of 7000 grey
seals on the Fame Islands off northeast

‘ﬂ‘ .
« aeﬁ‘éxé :7

 

Baltic and North Seas this summer, but he
suggests that arctic foxes or polar bears
provide a natural reservoir for the disease.
Polar bears travel long distances across the
northern wastes, travelling regularly
between Canada and the Soviet Union.
There is also speculation that the recent
outbreak of the disease among seals could
be connected to a suspected outbreak of a
distemper-like disease among harp, ringed
and common seals on Baffin Island in
northern Canada several years ago. [:1

 

England could carry the disease north. Five
dead grey seals had been washed up there,
he said last week.

Grey seals with the disease appear to
suffer the same breathing difficulties and
lethargy that affect common seals, but so
far, there have been few deaths. If this

changes, Harwood says, it will
pose a serious risk to the
species. Britain’s 100 000 grey
seals make up half the world’s
total.
Baker has examined more
than 50 seals from British
waters. He has found “a
variety of conditions unasso-
ciated with the current North
Sea problem”. He has received
23 corpses of grey seals since
March from the Dec estuary
where normally he would
expect to receive about two.
The examinations showed “no
speciﬁc infection” but “suggest
some increase in susceptibility
to infection”, he said.

The experiments to establish
what, if any, link exists
between persistent pollutants
such as polychlorinated bi-
phenyls (PCBs) and damage to
the immune systems of seals
will cost at least £150 000 and
could take between one and three years,
according to Dutch scientists involved. The
ﬁrst experiment will attempt to test the
immune responses of seals exposed to an
infective agent, such as tetanus.

It will compare the levels of antibodies
produced in response to the agent in the
blood of seals exposed to heavy pollution
with those in seals exposed to little or none.
Peter Reijnders, a marine ecologist from
the Dutch Research Institute for Nature
Management in Texel, who will collaborate
in the tests, hopes to use samples of blood
cultured in vitro.

He also plans to feed seals in captivity
with ﬁsh from polluted and unpolluted
waters and compare their resistance to
infection. This would repeat the technique
usedby Reijnders in 1986 which estab—
lished a link between PCBs and infertility
in common seals (New Scientist, 11
December 1986, p 20).

Jeff Vos, an immunotoxicologist at
Bilthoven, has found that PCBs suppress
the production of T-cells in laboratory rats
(New Scientist, 18 August, p 23). He says
that T-cells play an important role in the
response of the immune system to the
distemper virus. He will take part in the
proposed experiments.

The second experiment will try to estab—
lish exactly which, if any, of the 100 or so
PCBs may be responsible——or whether
several act together to harm seals. This will
be ex ensive——a sample of seal blubber
costs £1500 to analyse for different PCBs.

A report drawn up for last November’s
conference on the North Sea in London
identiﬁed varying concentrations of PCBs
in different grey seal colonies. >

Common seals in the Dutch Wadden
Sea showed higher levels of PCBs in their
tissue than British grey seals, though the
most serious problems, according to the
report, “appear to occur in the west and
east Frisian Wadden Sea which receives
high loads of pollutants from the Rhine and
Dutch industrial areas”. The report also
noted high levels of PCBs in the flesh
of seals from the coast of Schleswig—
Holstein and the Danish Wadden Sea.

EDITORIAL
By John Aspinall

t must be becoming clear to

more and more people with

every week that passes and

with every statistic that slaps

us in the face that most of the
perils that now confront the planet
stem from our own uncontrolled
population growth. The horror of five
billion humans—5.000 for every one
there was a mere million years ago-
is now squarely upon us and about to
get worse—much worse.

The already grotesque overburden
of human numbers is expected to
grow to between eight and eleven
billion before it is likely to plateau off
some time in the early part ofthe next
century. According to a report I read
recently in The Daily Telegraph.
demographers expect (‘hina‘s popu-
lation to reach 1.285 million within 12
years. Small comfort can be taken
from the fact that population growth
has levelled off in the highly
developed countries over the past few
decades. These industrialised states
are now supporting the maximum
numbers that can be sustained in the
short term. and their citizens con-
sume. on average. about 30 times as
much energy and resources. per
capita. as those of the Third World.
Thus. the 120 million Japanese have a
greater damaging impact on world
resources than the whole population
of China and India combined.

It is hard to find a single planetary
threat that does not have its origin in
gross. short-term human need. Trop-
ical forests which support more than a
million diverse species are scalped for
cash. cattle and monocultural food
production. Fossil deposits that have
taken millions of years to form are
burned into the atmosphere to keep
the mounting billions warm and
mobile. The consequences of such
profligacy are only now dimly being
understood and at an hour so late that
many doubt whether the collision
course we are on is avoidable. let
alone reversible. Widespread clima-
tic distortions such as greenhouse-
effcct storms. gashes in the delicate
fabric of the ozone curtain and other
equally disturbing phenomena are
reported daily.

Each week we read or hear of some
gathering disaster. It seems. from the
latest reports. that inland and land-
locked seas are dying fast. In April we
heard of the creeping eutrophication
of the northern Adriatic—~caused
largely by the contamination of the

river Po. now nothing more than a
cheap sewage duct for Milan and
Turin. And in May we read of the
fatal degradation of the Aral Sea and
the Sea of Asov accompanied by the
shrinkage of the fragile Caspian.

The news that the USSR was
reconsidering her abandoned plans to
divert the rivers Ob and Tobol to irri-
gate vast new areas of Kazakhstan for
cotton and wheat production filled
me with foreboding. A few weeks ago
I saw a report that the whole of the
Baltic beyond the Scaggerak was now
acknowledged to be in its death
throes. The corpses of 300 grey seals
had already been picked up and mill-
ions of fish were dying. Apparently
agricultural pollutants and industrial
toxic waste. the two ugly sisters.
were. as usual. mainly to blame.

When the inland and land-locked
seas become sterilised. who can seri—
ously doubt that the oceans will fol-
low? The great seas that cover three-
quarters of the earth are already
dangerously changed. Long-line fish-
ing fleets. accompanied by huge
factory ships. are scouring the high
seas for bulk catches. and although
Japan and the USSR are probably the
worst offenders. we are all impli—
cated.

The concept that one land mam-
mal. out of thousands. could eventu—

ally level a threat at the basic life

systems of the oceans would have
seemed impossible to even the wisest
and most far-seeing of our recent for-
bears. such as Malthus or Darwin.
and yet this is the case today.

Almost interminable is the list of

fauna and flora that we have exter—
minated in our brief but inglorious
reign as a species. Even the ‘building
blocks‘ of animal and plant life have
not escaped: in our feeding frenzy we
are savaging the relict whales at'one
end of the food chain and krill at the
other. and while seven million sharks
are killed annually. heretofore com-
mon pelagic species of zooplankton
and phytoplankton are also disap-
pearing fast.

On land. things are hardly any
better. Entire ecosystems have been
reduced to remnant status. with
species of plant or animal disappear-
ing at the rate of one a week. As I
write. reports are coming in from
East Africa that elephant numbers
are now in precipitous and what looks
like terminal decline—following. no
doubt. the example of the black
rhino. which is now on the very thresh-
old of extinction throughout Africa.

The readers of BB(‘WILI)I.IFE know
very well what is happening. In real-
ity it is a terrible experience just to
know—George Schaller once said.

“those who know the most fear the
most.“ He said that 20 years ago. and
now we all have fear in our hearts and
dread in our bones. The people who
are reading this article are probably
putting their weight against the
oncoming winds that precede the fire-
storm. Instinct and impulse are our
best guides. We act because we must.
each in his own preferred field where
personal experience and innate gifts
cart be put to play. Let us all be pre-
pared to face. with courage “and
determination. the battles which will
rage around us. In effect. we will
probably only be the dic-hards of the
old evolutionary order. Will a relief
force ever come in the shape of Aids.
or better still. a plague bacillus more
effective than the bubonic in the
thirteenth century?

It is up to us. the ‘lovers of the
Earth‘ to try to ensure that enough of
the natural world survives the human
experience so that the forces and pro-
cesses of evolution can regroup and
reorganise themselves to form a new
world. healed but diminished—Post
Hominem Mundus. [3

Deadly Combination Felling Trees in East

By PHILIP SHABECOFF
Special to The New York Times

MOUNT MITCHELL, NC, July
19 —— Thousands of dead trees,
their barren trunks and branches
stark against a hazy sky, stand like
an army of skeletons as far as the
eye can see along the crest of this
mountain.

Five years ago a red spruce for-
est covered the top of Mount Mitch-
ell, the highest mountain east of
the Mississippi. Today, only rasp-
berry and blackberry bushes,
clumps of sedge and a few young
trees, brown and dying, cover the
ground near the summit.

This stark evidence is forcing
many scientists to accept a conclu-
sion that seemed only a possibility
five years ago: air pollution, in-
cluding acids in the air, is combin-
ing with natural stresses to cause
heavy damage to forests through-
out the East.

“What you see here is happening
all along the crest of the Appala-
chians from Maine to Georgia,”
said Prof. Robert I. Bruck of North
Carolina State University, a plant
pathologist.

Dr. Bruck observed early symp—
toms of the decline of Mount Mitch-
ell’s spruce and fir five years ago.
Now the ecological system at the
summit has collapsed, he said.

‘Canary in the Coal Mine’

Dr. Bruck said he was “90 per-
cent certain” that manmade air
pollution traveling from the Ohio
and Tennessee valleys, particu-
larly low-level ozone and acidic
moisture in clouds, was combining
with such natural stresses as the
high temperatures and drought of
recent years to create an environ-
ment in which the trees cannot sur—
Vive.

So far, the effects are chiefly vis-
ible at high altitudes, where natu-

ral stresses are greatest and acidic
clouds are nearest. But a number
of scientists who believe that high
levels of air pollution are instru-
mental in destroying coniferous
forests at high altitudes in the East
also expressed another fear in in-
terviews over the past few days.

They warned that the death of
the mountaintop spruce and fir for-
ests might be what several of them
called “the canary in the coal
mine” — an early warning that for-
ests of low altitudes, including
hardwood forests, are also in dan-
ger of being damaged by a combi-
nation of man-made and natural
stresses.

Dr. Bruck said the damage he is
seeing on 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell
seems similar to the early stages
of the mass destruction of forests
in recent years in central Europe.

Di Bruck and the other scientists
intevnewed said that the role of air
pollution in killing the trees was
still a hypothesis rather than a

scientific fact. But virtually all con-
tended that prudence dictated action.

Of most serious concern, the scien-
tists said, are ozone and acidity in
clouds, rain, snow and dust. Ozone is
formed at ground level by the reaction
of sunlight with manmade pollutants
from automobile exhaust, industry and
a variety of small sources.

While ozone in the upper atmosphere
shields the earth from damaging ultra-
violet radiation from the sun, ground
level ozone contributes to smog, respi-
ratiory damage to people and damage
to trees and crops. Acid rain, clouds,
snow and dust are formed when pollu-
tants, chiefly oxides of nitrogen and
sulfur from coal-fired power plants,
are transformed chemically as they
travel through the atmosphere. Acid
rain has been found by scientists to be
destroying life in lakes and streams in
the Northeast and Canada.

But while the ill effects of these pollu-
tants have been documented, scientists
say it is difficult to separate their influ-
ence from climate or other possible
factors. The problem is complicated by
the fact that scientists only began in-
tensive studies of forests a decade ago.

‘We Should Not Wait’

Volker H. Mohnen, a professor of at-
mospheric science at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany, who has
watched half the spruce trees atop
Whiteface Mountain in upstate New
York die in recent years, said that
while it has not been conclusively
proved that air pollution added to natu-
ral stress is killing the trees, “1 would
advocate housekeeping before all the
answers are in.”

“We should not wait,” he said. “We
must address the problem holistical-

He said that a variety of pollutants
released by the combustion of fossil
fuel, including sulfur, nitrogen and car-
bon, might not only be damaging for-
ests but also might be contributing to
other crucial problems like urban
smog, acidic lakes and global warming,
the greenhouse effect.

There are, Dr. Mohnen said, “eco-
nomic and technological solutions to
improve our fossil fuel-based society
by increasing efficiency and, at the
same time, decrease emissions of sul-
fur, nitrogen and carbon.”

There is also growing evidence that}
air pollution may be damaging or slow-'

, ing the growth of trees in other parts of

Forests at lower
levels could also
be in danger.

evidence in recent years supported the
hypothesis that high ozone concentra-
tions were contributing to the decling-t
ing growth rate of southern yellow pine
trees, one of the nation’s more impor-
tant commercial species. There are
also indications that ozone and other
airborne pollutants are damaging
trees along virtually the whole length
of the Sierras in California, he said.

Opinion Has Evolved

Forest Service officials had been ex-
tremely skeptical until recently that
air pollution might play a significant
role in slowing the growth of trees and
damaging forests. Dr. Radloff said that
the evidence linking the declining
health of forests and the high levels of .
pollution reaching those forests was?
still “circumstantial.”

The World Research Institute, a
Washington-based research and policy
group, has had a team of scientists in—:
vestigating the potential effect of mul-
tiple air pollutants on trees and field
crops. Mohamed El-Ashry, the group’s
vice president for research and policy,
said that the research over the last two
years had demonstrated “systematic
links” between air pollution and the de-
struction of trees and crops in all parts
of the country.

Dr. El-Ashry also said the deaths of
trees reflected the end of a long pro-
cess reflecting the accumulated stress
of air pollution stretching back for dec-
ades. “By the time we see visible dam-
age it is the beginning of the end,” he

‘ Canada are experiencing stress at high
and low altitudes. The stress comes
from air pollution and from climate cx—
tremes we have seen in recent years
from the greenhouse effect. What is
going on is an indicator that the natural
environment is in very, very deep trou-

1 ble due to air pollution.

“Those mountain tops sit in a chemi-
cal soup made of ozone, acid fog and
acid deposition, which puts them under
continual stress. It is starting to look as
if those stressed systems are snapping
like rubber bands.”

The soup has been especially potent
on the top of Mount Mitchell in this hot,
dry.summer. It is widely agreed, Dr.
Bruck said, that ozone levels of 55 parts
per billion in the air are enough to

 

said.

Acid air pollution and ozone, Dr. El-
Ashry said, had been found to weaken,
trees to the point where “they cannot
avoid destruction by natural causes
such as frosts, high winds, insects and ,
disease.” ‘

He also said the group’s researchers ;
had been finding that the forests dying '
along the Eastern Seaboard cannot
regenerate because of high levels of
lead and other heavy metals in the soil.

Scientific Disagreement

Not all those with an immediate in—
terest in the nation's forests agree that.
air pollution is a threat to the nation’s
forests. Robert C. Kaufman, director of I
the air quality program of the Amer-
ican Paper Institute and National For-

est Products Association, industry
groups, said that “there is no evidence
that acid deposition is affecting the soil
of commercial forests.”

He asserted, “We do not see conclu-
sive evidence air pollution in general is
causing reduced productivity in com-
mercial forests.”

Mr. Kaufman added that the indus-
try saw no need for a regulatory pro-
gram to curb acid rain, but that it did
support more research into the effects
of acid rain.

Walter L. Warnick, whorepresents
the Energy Department on the Admin-
istration’s acid rain study program,
said that the death of trees on a large
scale “is not unprecedented in histo-
ry.” He also said that the scientific con-
sensus that pollution from fossil fuels is
damaging trees is “shaky.”

Several scientists have contended
that the trees are dying because of cli-
matic factors, particularly the hot
summers and cold winters of recent
years. .

But Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, an at-
mospheric physicist with the Environ-
mental Defense Fund, a national envi-
ronmental group, said that mounting
evidence shows this: “Forests all
along the Eastern seaboard and into

. cause physiological damage to spruce

and fir trees. Measurements taken by
his research team, he reported, have
shown that since May 1, ozone levels
have been above that level 90 percent
of the time; more than 120 parts per
billion 28 percent of the time, and once
reached a high of 178 parts per billion.
Moreover. the ozone has remained
mer the mountain through the night in-
stead of dissipating as it normally does
in lower latitudes, he said.

Dr. Bruck has also noted a rapid de-
terioration of the forest down the slope,
all the way to the transition line be-
tween the coniferous and hardwood
trees. Dr. Bruck said he had observed
some damge to the hardwood trees but
that there had not been any studies of
the extent or the cause of the damage
to these trees.

Standing at the edge of a bowl of dead
and dying trees several thousand feet
below the summit of Mount Mitchell,
Dr. Bruck said, “This is not supposed
to be happening."

2 Wildlife Refuge
ls Contaminate

With Mercury

Poison May Endanger
New Orleans Project

By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS

Special to The New York Times

NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 8 — The
United States Fish and Wildlife Service
said here today that high levels of mer-
cury, a deadly poison, had been found
in a proposed national wildlife refuge
within the New Orleans city limits.

Traces of mercury were found in
Federal tests in the proposed refuge,
an 18,500-acre marshy wildlife habitat
in the eastern part of the city that has
been viewed for decades by developers
as a place for subdivisions and shop-
ping centers. More recently, the city
has regarded the land as a logical spot
for a new airport.

But conservationists promoted the
area as a nature refuge, and they pre-
vailed with the help of city leaders hop-
ing for more tourist dollars in an econ-
omy depressed by low oil prices.

way they said, ‘See you later’?”

THE NEW YORK T‘MES, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1988

Federal, state and local officials met
here today to hear the test results, re-
ceived by the Department of the ln—
terior last month, and to discuss the
possible consequences.

Acquisition to Be Pursued

But Federal officials emphasized
that, while mercury was found in sedi-

ment and in fish, more data were1

needed to evaluate the damage. Addi-
tional test results will be available in
October.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, which
is part of the Interior Department, in-
tends “to pursue acquisition of the
land,” said Phillip Morgan, a regional
agency official in Atlanta. But he
added, “We are not going to acquire a
contaminated area that’s then going to
become our problem.”

Among the questions that must be
answered, he said, are, “How can it be
corrected and can it be corrected?”

Unusually high levels of mercury
were found in sediment, and lesser
amounts in fish. The mercury is appar-
ently leaking from an adjacent landfill
used for city garbage disposal, a failed
recycling project that had been under-
taken in the 1970’s.

Earlier this summer tests found that
oxygen in water next to the landfill was

the richest

in America.’

 

nearly depleted.

According to a state official, the land-
fill, operated by the American Waste
and Pollution Control Company, a sub-
sidiary of Waste Management of North
America lnc., which is the largest han-
dler of waste in the nation, has been the
source of many violations of state regu-
lations in the 1980’s, including failure to
cover up garbage.

“Inspectors would find exposed
wastes, garbage of all kinds, which can
blow around and rain can wash into the
waterways,” said Tim Hardy of the
Louisiana Department of Environmen-
tal Quality in Baton Rouge.

Don Clark, the president of Amer-
ican Waste and Pollution Control, said
today that the violations occurred in a
time when the state was indecisive
about what its regulations should be.

Conservationists here say the refuge,

 

to he named the Hay-nu \‘fuwage Urc'm
National Wildlife Refuge, would be un-
usual not only because of its size and
variety of wildlife but also because it
lies within the city's borders, about 15
miles from the central business dis-
trict.

The refuge was authorized by Con-
gress in 1986 following negotiations
among representatives of the property
owner, Southpoint lnc., a subsidiary of
Merrill Lynch & Company lnc., and the
city, state environmental groups and
political leaders.

$8 Million Appropriated

Congress has appropriated $8 million
to buy the land and for initial opera-
tions of the refuge.

The agreement set aside 18,500 acres
of lakes, forest and marshland for the
refuge and an additional 6,500 acres for
private and commercial development
that would not harm the area’s wildlife,
which includes deer, otters, alligators
and a wide variety of waterfowl.

In a census last year scientists found
almost 60,000 birds, including teal, coot,
snowy egrets, the great blue heron and
other species in the freshwater marsh-
es, moss-draped hardwood forest and
tidal marsh that which make up the

_ giant urban wetlands.

There have been indications of leaks
in the New Orleans landfill for two
years, said Oliver A. Houck, a law pro-
fessor at Tulane University and a lead-
ing environmentalist in the state, but
there was no inkling that the dump, de—
signed for household garbage, con-
tained mercury.

A Poisoned Paradise

“I’m sick about this,” he said.
“We’ve poisoned the richest. wildlife
paradise in America, and that’s a
tragedy.”

He called mercury “one of the most

poisonous compounds in nature,” add-
ing: “It doesn’t dissolve in water or
bodies. It just stays in tissue and builds
up.”
Chronic exposure to mercury, either
through breathing mercury vapor or
ingesting compounds containing mer-
cury, can cause diarrhea, inflamma-
tion of the mouth, tremors, difficulty in
speaking or walking and other neuro-
logical problems such as irritability,
apprehension and depression.

In cases of chronic poisoning, mer-
cury can be removed from the body.
through chelation, a process in which‘
the patient is administered a drug that
binds to the mercury so that it can be ,
excreted from the body. l

NEW RULES SIGNAL TOUGHER U.S. STANCE AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL

BOONDOGGLES: KASTEN

 

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. will now Inslst that International development projects
protect envlronmentally sensltlve wetlands before the U.S. supports project fundlng by

lnternatlonal banks, U.S. Sen. Bob Kasten, R.-Wla., said today.

Kasten said new rules issued this week by the Treasury Department "are aimed at
beefing up U.S. efforts to stop development projects in Third World nations that destroy
critical ecosystems, such as wetlands, before they get started."

The "Wetlands Standards" provide voting instructions to the U.S. Executive Directors
of multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, Inter-American Development
Bank, African Development Bank and Asian Development Bank.

Treasury has already drawn up rules for protection of tropical forests and
sub-Saharan savannas, Kasten said, but "the wetlands guidelines are arguably the most
important.

"Wetlands are among the world’s most diverse and productive ecosystems," Kasten
said. "They play critical roles in water purification and storage, habitat protection, and
flood control."

Kasten, ranking member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee,
has been the prime congressional advocate of the environmental guidelines. He said the
wetlands rules "signal a further resolve on the part of this Administration to toughen up

its act in opposing projects that are environmentally unsound.

"We want to signal our growing willingness to put our environmental cards on the

table in opposing bad projects," he said. "We’re going to be more aggressive in opposing
loans for environmentally unsound projects and in soliciting similar opposition from other
bank member-states."

As a result of legislation Kasten added to the 1989 Foreign Assistance
Appropriations bill, U.S. positions on the environmental consequences of proposed loans
will be shared with other bank member nations to reform, or if necessary defeat, proposed
projects with unacceptable environmental consequences.

Key provisions announced today the following requirements:

0 Wetlands not be adversely impacted unless adequate alternatives have been

considered;

0 Any wetlands alteration must be ecologically sustainable;

0 Projects must protect cultural integrity and property rights of indigenous peOples;

0 Sites identified by the Ramsar (Iran) Convention not be adversely impacted by

projects; and

o Endangered species and biological diversity be protected.

"Like in our domestic ’swampbuster’ requirements, today’s directive by the
Administration recognizes the critical importance of wetlands as the most productive
class of biological systems," Kasten said. "Swampbuster" refers to the 1985 Farm Bill
provisions that prohibit federal farm program benefits to those who convert wetlands to
agricultural production.

"Had all three standards (wetlands, tropical forest, and sub-Saharan savannas) been
in place previously, we might have avoided the tragedies of projects like Poloroneste in
Brazil and the Livestock [II project in Botswana, Kasten noted.

He added that upcoming projects likely to invoke the new wetlands standards include
the $500 million World Bank Brazil Electric Sector II Project; the $110 million
Inter-American Development Bank Ecuador Daule Peripa Hydroelectric Project and the
additional components of the $953 million World Bank India Narmada Dam and

Resettlement Project.

THE NEW YORK TIMES THE ENVIRONMENT ’I‘i ’ESDAY. Ali’tii' ’ST 23,

His Bold Statement
Transforms the Debate
OnGreenhouse Effect

 

By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 

Sitting in his office near the Colum-
bia University campus, seven floors
above the internal combustion of fos-
sil fuel along Broadway, James E.
Hansen held a large pair of what he
called loaded dice. He was making a
point last week about the probabil-
ities of drastic climate change as a
result of the greenhouse effect.

In testimony before a Senate sub-
committee in June, Dr. Hansen, an at-
mospheric physicist and director of
the Goddard Institute for Space Stud—
ies, sounded the alarm with such au-
thority and force that the issue of an
overheating world has suddenly
moved to the forefront of public con-
cern.

What had been theory about future

consequences of human activity af— .

fecting the atmosphere now seemed
to be coming true, he said, and not
only elaborate data of temperature
trends but also this summer’s wither-
ing drought and heat wave challenged
most lingering doubts.

Reputation at Risk

With his decision to come right out
and say the greenhouse effect was
here, Dr. Hansen knew he was risking
his reputation as a cautious and care-
ful scientist. But in an interview he
said he had no reason to soften his as-
sessment. He had made the card-
board dice to illustrate the trend in
climate change as projected in
mathematical models developed
from the observations of increasing
carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluo-
rocarbons and other “greenhouse"
gases in the atmosphere.

Like glass in a greenhouse, these
gases are transparent to incoming
sunlight, but they absorb heat radi-
ated from the ground and prevent it
from escaping into space.

He held up one die representing the
climate for the period 1950-1980. Two
sides were white for an average sum—
mer, and two other sides were blue
for colder-than-average summers.

The other two sides were red for hot—
ter-than-average summers. Thus, on
a roll of the die ioi that period, there
were two chances in six of having a
hot summer at any given location in
the country.

Then Dr. Hansen picked up the die
for the 1990’s and explained:

“If our climate model calculations
are approximately correct, the green-
house warming in the 1990’s will be
sufficient to shift the probabilities
such that the chance of a hot summer
in most of the country will be in the
range of 55 to 80 percent. Four sides
of the die are red. i believe it is obvi-
ous that the man in the street will no-
tice that by then the dice are loaded.
There will be more hot summers than
normal, and the hottest ones will be
hotter than they used to be.”

Support in Congress

Dr. Hansen’s message, a mix of
data-based analysis and plain-spoken
conviction, has had a stunning impact
on political thinking, say experts on
the environment and piihiic policy.
Bipartisan support is growing in Con~
gress to increase financing for cli—
mate research and to consider legis-
lation aimed at coniioiiiiig the intro-
duction of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.

At a 46—nation Conference on the
Changing Atmosphere in Toronto
shortly after Dr. Hansen’s testimony,
smentists and policy makers urged
development of energy consumption
policies that would drastically reduce
carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is increas-
ing at an annual rate of (me-half o
p'-rcent i‘ret'ause of the burning of fos
Sil fuels ~ ~ oil, gas and espemally coal
~- and tht dust: Ut. tion of :ropical foi-
ests.

Michael Oppenheimer, an atmos-
pheric scientist with the Environmeix
tal Defense Fund, a public advocacy
group, said Dr. Hansen’s Senate testi-
mony “shook up a lot of people” in
Washington and offered an air of
scientific respectability and imme-
diacy to the environmental move-
ment's longstanding warnings about

"l’ve never seen an environmental
issue mature so quickly, shifting
from science to the policy realm al-
most overnight,” Mr. Oppenheimer
said. “It took a Government forum
during a drought and a heat wave and
one scientist with guts to say, ‘Yes, it
looks like it has begun and we've de-
tected it.‘ He felt comfortable saying
clearly and loudly what others were

But Dr. Hansen, speaking this
month to a National Governor’s Ax

sociatiwn mew: mg on energy and envr
ronment, countered With data shov»
ing that average global temperatures
had risen by one degree Fahrenheit
over the last 100 years and had been
higher in the 1980’s than at any time
in that period. The four warmest
years on record, moreover, have all
been in this decade, and so far 1988 is
the warmest year of all.

“It became quite clear this sum

surface temperatures hot enough to

Asked what NASA’s reaction has
been to his recent bold statements,
Dr. Hansen gave a nervous smile.
‘They’re still trying to make up their
minds,” he said.

He recalled that on previous occa-
sions the Office of Management and
Budget, which reviews official state-
ments that have implications for the
budget, had forced him to delete from
the text of proposed Congressional
testimony any recommendations for
:iacreased research spending. Last
November, rather than remove such
statements, he testified as a private

(continued)

Somehow, the budget .itfice over-
looked his proposed statements for
this June. “I understand they were
really upset,” Dr. Hansen said. “Next
time, I may be back testifying as a
private citizen again.”

More Data Collection

One of his recommendations is an
expansion of global meteorological
observations, including more data
collection from the oceans. Most
weather stations are on land. But pro—
posed satellites for the 1990’s could
fill in observational gaps and answer
questions about how much heat is
being stored in the oceans and the
potential impact on climate.

 

‘What we had been
predicting is just
what’s happening.’

 

A NASA task force, headed by Dr.
Sally K. Ride, the former astronaut,
proposed last year a “mission to
planet earth” as one of the agency’s
long-term goals. The mission would
involve a coordinated scientific study
of earth resources and environment
from American and international
satellites. NO official action has been
taken on any Of the task force’s pro-
posals.

“NASA is an agency without a mis—
sion,” Mr. Oppenheimer said. “If it
was smart, NASA would treat Hansen
as a star. Here is a problem and a
mission that the public might reallv
get behind.”

2 Senate Bills Take Aim at 6Greenhouse Effect9

 

By Michael Weisskopf

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

The first legislation aimed at re-
versing global warming was intro-
duced in the Senate yesterday, and
it set the price of avoiding the po-
tentially catastrophic results Of the
“greenhouse effect” at nothing less
than fundamental changes in the
US. economy.

Two Senate bills propose differ-‘

eat, but complementary, ap-
proaches to reducing the man-made
gases that trap solar heat, raising
temperatures worldwide. Taken
together, the measures would im-
pose strict controls On everything
from automobile exhaust to home
furnaces, redesign landfills, elim-
inate chloroﬂourocarbons and ef-
fectively discourage use of coal as a
source Of energy in favor of a “new
generation” Of nuclear reactors,
solar power and natural gas.

The bills trample on so many in-
terest groups that neither Of the
chief sponsors—Sen. Robert T.
Stafford (R-Vt.) and Sen. Timothy
E. Wirth (D-COlO.)—-expect to
achieve anything more than com-
mittee hearings in the remaining
months of the current Congress.

Wirth noted the “conﬂicting co-
alitions out there” and said that get-
ting Congress tO approve what
amounts to “restructuring our econ-
:imy” may be as difficult as Mikhail
(sorbachev’s perestroika in the So-
did: Union.

“tafford, anticipating complaints
-'na: his bill “demands too much in a
few places” and would drastically
alter American life styles, asked
fellow senators to consider “what

the world may resemble if we fail to
act.” “It will be a world hostile tO
humanity and the rest Of life in doz-
ens Of ways; it will be a world which
I would wish on neither my children
nor grandchildren,” he said.

According to scientists, green-
house gases will trap so much heat by

world temperatures will rise as much
as eight degrees. Some areas will dry
up, and oceans will expand, leading to

A NASA scientist testified in Con-
gress last month that this year’s
temperatures are “significantly
warmer” than any previous period

” SEN. ROBERT T. STAFFORD '
. . . says Senate must not fail to act

measures would cut only one or two
degrees out Of the expected eight-
degree rise.

Yesterday’s bills find common
ground in urging reductions Of car-
bon dioxide, the most dangerous
greenhouse gas, which is generated
by the burning Of coal and Oil. The
bills differ on the extent of reduc-
tions and in their approaches tO the
problem.

Stafford is seeking a 50 percent
cut in carbon dioxide by the year
2000. The burden would fall on cars,
which would have to cut carbon di-
oxide emissions in half; power plants,
which would have to cut their use Of
fossil fuels in half; and home fur—
naces. Five years after enactment,
all new homes would have to be
equipped with furnaces and water

heaters emitting no more [",illttilt)n
than the. best technology them: avaﬂ
able.

Wirtli's bill, whit‘ll has 15 £03;an
sors, aims at a 230 percent cut in
carbon dioxide by the year 2000.
An aide said this would be achieved
by increasing efficiency of plants
using fossil fuels and by reducing
the demand for those fuels.

The measure calls for 3 “Least-
Cost National Energy Plan" to be
devised by the government to con-
serve fossil fuels and tap “renew-
able” energy sources, such as wind,
solar, geothermal and hydroelectric
power; a $450 million program over
three years tO research and develop
renewable sources; an energy con-
servation plan to cut energy use by
2 to 4 percent annually; and allocat-
ing $500 million to research, devel-
op and demonstrate technologies
for new, safe and cost-efficient nu-
clear reactors.

The most strenuous Opposition to
the bills is expected from the utility
and automobile industries, but their
spokesmen withheld comment until
further study.

John Grasser Of the National Coal
Association said too little is known
about the greenhouse effect, and it
is “shortsighted to base energy pol-
icy on anticipated environmental
effects that we are not sure will
ever come about.”

Michael Oppenheimer of the En-
vironmental Defense Fund praised
both bills. He said it is important to
invest in renewable sources of en-
ergy so they will become available
later and to impose controls on in-
dustry so they will know “what our
long-tuna ;. mi x are"

 




PROPOSED RULES Fed. Reg.: 9/8/88, p. 34795

Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to reduce the fee charged for an
import/export license from $250 per year to $125 per year. The
Service also proposes to eliminate the five prepaid shipments allowed
under the current regulations. Beginning on the effective date of
this regulation, the Service proposes to charge a $25 inspection fee
for each shipment presented for clearance by a licensee. Further, the
Service proposes to change its policy for renewing import/export
licenses and collecting import/export inspection fees. Beginning
October 1, 1988, the Service proposes to no longer bill importers and
exporters for renewal of licenses or for inspection fees. The Service
proposes to require import/export licensees to apply for renewal to
the issuing office at least 30 days before the current license
expires. The Service also poposes to require import/export licensees
to pay inspection fees before or at the time of inspection. Comments
must be received by 10/11/88, to Director, FWS, Box 28006, Wash DC

Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to list a fish, the Roanoke
Longperch
as an endangered species. Endemic to Virginia, this fish now occurs
only in four widely separated populations: In the upper Roanoke
River, the Pigg River, the Nottoway River and the Smith River. Each
population is vulnerable because of its relatively low density and
limited extent. The largest and most vigorous population, in the
upper Roanoke River, is subject to the most serious threats: from
urbanization, industrial development, waste supply and flood control
projects, and from agricultural runoff. The other three populations
are subject to siltation resulting from agricultral activities and to
potential chemical spill. Comments must be received by 11/7/88,

By Alan B. Durning

 

N June 18, Ivair Higino de
Almeida, a peasant farmer living
near the remote Amazonian town
of Xapuri, Brazil, rose early to milk his
cow. Several hours later his family found
him lying dead on a dusty road en route to
his pasture. He had been shot eight times.

This victim of the violence endemic to
the Brazilian back country had appar-
ently committed the crime of political in-
discretion: running for town council on
the wrong side of the region’s most vola-
tile issue — forest clearing. He was a mem-
ber of the party supported by the rubber
tappers’ union, a syndicate of 30,000 men
and women who earn a living by collect-
ing natural rubber and Brazil nuts in the
disappearing rain forest. The union has
been a tenacious opponent of forest de-
struction. Mr. Higino’s murderers, on the
other hand, are believed to have been
hired guns of the ultraconservative,
ultrapowerful cattle ranchers, loggers,
and land speculators who reap quick
proﬁts from deforestation.

Lush tropical forests once blanketed
the state of Acre, where Xapuri is situ-
ated, but since the ’603 powerful eco-
nomic and political forces have thrown
fortune seekers into the jungles. With
each new invasion, the forest is pushed
back and its interior cut into an irregular
patchwork of clearings and trees.

The rich come to exploit vast spreads
of land, while the poor — mostly displaced
rural workers and tenant farmers — come
with dreams of a better life on their own
plot of land. Rich and poor alike clear the
forest to establish their claim, and the
national government consistently pro—
motes the process through tax incentives
ind road projects.

THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR

Violence in the Brazilian jungle— a global concern

The ultimate trag-
edy of the deforesta-
tion is that, in the
long run, no one
beneﬁts. Rain forest
soil is extremely
fragile, sustaining
only a few years of
cultivation before it
degrades into use-
less brush. Ranchers
and farmers have no
choice but to clear
more trees, repeat-
ing the vicious circle,
and the rubber tap-
pers who have been
in the forest for dec-
ades are simply driven out — some-
times at gimpoint.

In the late ’70s a band of
Xapuri’s rubber tappers organized
to protect their forests through im-
provised methods reminiscent of
Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Lu—
ther King. Men, women, and chil-
dren would enter the land where
the forest was falling to the chain
saw and the torch and appeal to
the hired hands with simple logic:
“The forest is the roof over our
heads, it is our life and livelihood.
Please, we are poor like you. Do
not burn our home to the ground."

If persuasion did not sufﬁce,
they would peacefully occupy the
forest, putting their bodies in the
path of destruction. More recently
they have taken their protests into
the courthouse, the legislative
chamber, and the governor’s man-
sion. On the international level,
they have helped reshape World
Bank and Inter-American Develop-
ment Bank lending policy by show-

"’ more proﬁtable per

ranching or farming.
But one conse-
quence of their suc-
cess has been violent
reprisal from land-
owners. In 1981 the
president of the ru-
ral labor union, a
rubber tapper
A named Rio Sopiero
de Souza, was assas-
sinated, and this
May two teen—age
rubber tappers were shot repeat-
edly by unidentiﬁed gunmen while
they slept. They were among 300
people sitting in at government of-
ﬁces to protest illegal forest clear-
ing by a local cattle rancher.

In none of these cases have the
police brought charges. Before
Higino was murdered, the rubber
tappers had received death threats
from a landlord with claims to a
contested area. Residents call the
local criminal-justice system a
crime, contending that the police
are bought off by the landlords.

Violent repression of trade
unions is a violation of fundamen-
tal human rights wherever it oc-
curs, and deserves international
attention; yet the context of
Higino’s murder gives his case a
global dimension. The forests at
stake are a critical link in the
earth’s life-support system.

The Amazonian rain forests,

of the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, can be
thought of as the lungs of the earth. They
regulate the climate of South America
and slow greenhouse warming by absorb-
ing carbon dioxide that would otherwise
trap the sun’s heat. The earth’s tempera-
tures are partly determined by the num-
ber of trees in Xapuri. And as the weather
goes, so go our farms, food prices, and
economy.

Moreover, with more than a million
species, the Amazon Basin holds the larg-
est concentration of living things on
earth. The diversity of ﬂora and fauna in
a few square miles of rain forest exceeds
that of the entire United States.

Yet as Brazil’s economy has sunk ever
deeper under the weight of international
debt, rain forest destruction has acceler—
ated. In the time it takes to read this
article, an area the size of several football
ﬁelds will have been stripped of forest
cover. The world may already be losing
tens of species each day, most of them
unknown, as habitat is destroyed. What
role they play in maintaining the health
of ecosystems we do not know — nor what
value they might have to science, medi-
cine, and agriculture.

Across the Amazon Basin, thousands
of unorganized rubber tappers are watch-
ing Xapuri, wondering whether they too
could join hands to protect their forests.
They are watching to see if Ivair Higino’s
murderers are brought to trial.

Only a full investigation and criminal
prosecution can show that law and not
ﬁrepower shall rule in the rain forest.
And until justice is done, neither basic
human rights, nor the thousands of en-
dangered species, nor the health of the
global climate can be protected.

Brazil Accuses Scholar
Of Aiding Indian Protest

 

RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 13 — The

Brazilian federal police have brought
charges against an American anthro-
pologist who accompanied two Amazon
Indian leaders on a visit to Washington
earlier this year.
Brazilian authorities have appar-
ently been angered because the Kaiapo
Indians were received by officials of
the World Bank, the State Department
and Treasury Department as well as
Congressional staff members. The In-
dians complained of official mistreat-
ment and the destruction of their jun-
gle environment.

A major focus of their complaints
was a new hydroelectric dam complex
planned along the Xingu River in cen-
tral Brazil, which is scheduled to flood
ap an 20 million acres, including Kaiapo
an s.

 

 

By MARLISE SIMONS

Special to The New York Times

The decision to press charges
against Darrell Posey, a 41-year-old
anthropologist and biologist from Ken-
tucky, seemed aimed at sending a
warning about the limits of official
tolerance of protests abroad. Repre-
sentatives of Brazil’s estimated 220,000
Indians have become increasingly
vocal at home, but few have traveled
abroad.

Dr. Posey, who translated for the two
Kaiapo, has been charged with violat—
ing a law that forbids foreigners to in-
terfere in Brazilian internal affairs. A
spokesman of the federal police in
Brasilia said that if found guilty, Dr.
Posey “will be expelled from the coun—
try.”

Denying the Indians 8 Voice

“The police want me to admit that l
unlawfully took the Indians to Wash-

ington,” Dr. Posey said. “The real
issue here is the right of the Indians to
speak for themselves about whatever,
and wherever, they want.”

José Carlos Castro, Dr. Posey’s law-
yer, has argued that his client cannot
be punished for any criticism he or
others made in the United States unless
he violated American law.

Dr. Posey has studied the Kaiapo, a
group of ancient warrior tribes, for the
last 11 years and is coordinator of the
department of ethnobiology at the Emi-
lio Goeldi Museum in the Amazonian
city of Belém.

He and the Kaiapo traveled to Miami
in late January to attend a conference
on tropical rain forests at Florida In-
ternational University, which paid all
expenses. The federal police here pro-
vided the Kaiapo with passports, and
the regional director of the National ln-
dian Foundation authorized their
travel to Miami.

Members of the National Wildlife
Federation and the Environmental De-
fense Fund, two American conserva-
tion groups, said they provided further
funds at the Miami conference and set
up a schedule for the Indians to visit of-
ficials in Washington.

At the heart of the Brazilian Govern-

THILIYEW vomit, TIMES AUGUST I4, 1988_

 

ment’s action appears to be official
concern over a proposed $500 million
loan by the World Bank to Brazil’s
state-owned power company, Electro-
bras. Although the loan is not ear-
marked for a specific project, this com—
panv will build the Xingu dams.

As part of the evidence in the case,
Mr. Castro said, the police are using
Brazilian newspaper reports about the
Kaiapo visit to Washington last Febru-
ary. The reports speculated that the ln-
dians’ testimony could adversely affect
approval of the $500 million loan. Ne-
gotiations began almost two years ago,
but the loan approval has been post-
poned several times and it was re-
cently rescheduled for a vote in Octo-
ber. Some Brazilian officials are said to
believe that the delay is related to the
Kaiapo complaints.

A spokesman for the World Bank
denied any such link. “Sure there is a
lot of concern at the bank about the
Xingu project,” the spokesman said.
“We cannot lend money to the Brazil
power sector and close our eyes to the
ﬁguidelines for the environment and the
Amerindians.”

But he said the loan had been held up
because the bank was looking into what

 

 

he described as the power company’s
huge debt, its poor management and
wasteful use of resources.

Sensitivity to Foreign Criticism

The case against Dr. Posey has none-
theless highlighted growing official
sensitivity about foreign pressure as
the country is developing the immense
resources of the Amazon. Officials fre-
quently react with irritation when for-
eign governments, environmental
groups and international loan agencres
express concern about Indian rights
and safeguarding a region that holds
the world’s largest tropical forest and
river network.

The reception given to the Indians in

' Washington attracted attention at the

highest levels of the Government. The
national security council and the na-
tional intelligence agency have exam-
ined details and motives behind the
Washington visit, while the order to
press charges against Dr. Posey has
reportedly come from high officnals of
the Ministry of Justice in Brasilia.

No charges have been brought
against Kube-i and Paiakan, the two
Kaiapo. In Brazil, Indians are wards of
the state and are treated as minors be-
fore the law.

RIO DE JANEIRO. Brazil —- Thou-
sands of fortuneseeking gold panners
are being forced by their own govern-
ment to leave much of Brazil’s Amazon
jungle. according to leaders of the dig-
gers’ union.

The prospectors’ complaints were
aired at a news conference on Tuesday
when President Jose Sarney’s govern-
ment was accused of kicking free-lance
gold panners out of huge tracts of land
set aside for parks, Indian reservations
and large-scale mining companies. And
the gold panners, known as “garimpei-
ros,” are angry.

“The government is acting against us
because we don’t depend on it We live
alone in the forest, relying on no one but
ourselves,“ said Jose Altino Machado,

president of the Garimpeiros Labor
Union;

His union claims to represent 400,000
scruffy gold panners scattered across
the vast. jungle-clad Amazon basin in
ntrthern Brale.

housands of Brazilian men have
poured into the Amazon region since
1980 in search of their fortunes, creating
one of the biggest gold rushes in history.

Evoking images of the California
gold-seekers of the 18405, they come
armed with picks, shovels, pans and of-
ten riﬂes to protect their claims from
rival garimpeiros.

The garimpeiros have helped make
Brazil the world’s sixth largest gold pro—
ducer, accounting for over three—quar-
ters of the country’s production, gold
analysts say.

But prospectors say they have gotten
small thanks for their tireless work un-
der dangerous conditions.

They said President Sarney is now
under pressure from an unholy alliance
of environmentalists and powerful min-
ing companies to bar gold panners from
huge tracts of Amazon land.

“Our biggest enemy is the (the gov-
ernment’s) Environmental Secretariat.

 

‘Our biggest enemy is the (the government’s)
Environmental Secretariat. Every time we ﬁnd gold,
they say that trees and monkeys are more valuable than
gold and tell us we have to leave.’ '

i —- Jose Altino Machado, President, Garimpeiros Labor Union

 

Every time we find gold, they say that
trees and monkeys are more valuable
than gold and tell us we have to leave,”
said Mr. Machado.

He said that police have chased gar-
impeiros out of sprawling national parks
and biological reserves, areas that could
yield tons of gold and help pay off Bra-
zil’s $121 billion foreign debt.

Since 1979, Brazil has set up nine
such parks and reserves across the Am-
azon, including the Jan National Park,
which is the size of Greece, in the heart
of the region in Amazonas state.

Indian reservations also impinge on

lands that could yield millions of dollars
worth of gold, said Mr. Machado.

“The government sees we‘re finding
gold in (Indian areas). But instead of
encouraging us to dig it up, it says: ‘You
can’t stay here,’ ” said Antonio Feijao, a
geologist and union leader.

“So the garimpeiros go across the
border to Venezuela and find gold for
Venezuela. . . and Brazil loses,” he said.

President Sarney’s government also
has set aside enormous tracts of Ama-
zon land for gold prospecting by mining
companies, often with multinational
connections, the union leaders said.

Vast Amazon Fires,

Man-Made, Linked
To Global Warming

 

By MARLISE SIMONS

Special to The New York Times

SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil,
Aug. 6 — Like eerie ghosts of the trees
and animals dying below, thick clouds
of smoke are rising over the rain forest
as the man-made fires of the annual
dry season are once again upon the
Amazon.

On some days, fires rage in thou-
sands of places across the vast Ama-
zon basin, following a broad belt where
settlers and farmers are beating back
the jungle frontier. For many, fire is
the only tool for transforming forest
into farm or pasture.

From the flames, tons of fumes and
particles are hurled into the sky, and at
night, roaring and red, the forest looks
to be at war.

Now, Brazilian and American scien-
tists in a new satellite monitoring pro—
gram are for the first time pinpointing
and measuring the effects of the fires
The destruction and burning of forest
here is so vast, the scientists say, that i.
may account for at least one-tenth of
the global manmade output of carbon
dioxide, which is believed to be causing
a warming of the earth through the
greenhouse effect. Burning of fossil
fuels acCounts for most of the carbon
dioxide released worldwide.

Environmentalists have long warned
of the destruction that is increasing
with each new dry season, and wit-
nesses every year report more ceme-
teries of trees. The scientists’ findings
show that in 1987 the burnings ruined
more forest cover than previously
thought and proved to be major pollut-
ers of the earth's atmosphere.

In 1987, Brazilian scientists estimate,
fires just in Brazil’s part of the Ama-
zon basin covered 77,000 square miles,
an area one and a half times the size of
New York State. Of these, at least
30,000 square miles were newly felled
virgin forest, the researchers said. The
remainder, they added, involved re-
grown forest on on previously cleared
land, savannas and fields.

clude the most comprehensive esti-

of miles. This has raised questions
about a possible link between the gi-
gantic emissions from the fires in the
South American tropics and the dam-
age to the earth’s protective ozone
shield over Antarctica.

Smoke Rises to 12,000 Feet

Alberto Setzer, coordinator of the
satellite data at the Space Research
Center in this south Brazilian city, said
smoke clouds from the Amazon fires
often rose to 12,000 feet. Their gases
and particles were then lifted up higher
into jet streams and blown south
across the South Atlantic, close to Ant-

 

arctica. Many scientists now believe

 

that several of these gases, including
methane and nitrogen oxides, are
among the reactive gases that can di-
rectly or indirectly deplete ozone, Dr.
Setzer said.

“There is no proof yet that the ma-
terial is interacting with the ozone
shield, which is much higher in the
stratosphere,” said Dr. Setzer. “But we
know the material gets to the Antarctic
region, and we know that storms can
pump it upward. We do not know yet
how high it reaches. Several people are
working on this.”

American scientists who took part in

the mission over Antarctica by the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration in October said they had not
searched for or found evidence of com-
pounds from the Amazon. But NASA
researchers are now searching for
such traces by satellite.

But even without the ozone question,
Dr. Setzer said, the “tremendous”
emissions coming off the Amazon pose
serious problems. “They are large
enough to cause significant changes in
the chemical balance of the atmos-
phere and influence the global weath-
er," he said.

A Doubly Harmful Effect

harmful, l)r Setzer .lnd other re-
searchers noted. The dmnding forest
cover becomes not only less efficient in
absorbing and removing this “green-
house gas,” but the fires also add new,
huge volumes of it.

A report prepared by the study group
at the Space Research Center esti-
mated that the fires in Brazil last year
produced carbon dioxide containing
more than 500 million tons of carbon.
The fires also produced 44 million tons
of carbon monoxide, more than six mil-
lion tons of particles, almost five mil-
lion tons of methane, two and a half
million tons of ozone and more than one
million tons of nitrogen oxides and
other substances that can circulate
globally and influence radiation and
climate.

“There is enough to compare it to the
outburst of a very large volcano," Dr.
Setzer said.

The study results on deforestation
and emissions from the fires so far
cover only the Brazilian two-thirds of
the Amazon rain forest. Still more of
the pollutants are produced by fires in
parts of the Amazon basin outside
Brazil.

“Our findings in general agree with :

a physicist who is part of a group
studying deforestation and emissions
at the Goddard Space Hight Center at
Greenbelt, Md. The NASA group, he
said, is now also analyzing satellite

4 data of other countries of the Amazon

basin, including Bolivia and Peru,
where burnings have increased.

“This phenomenon has been greatly
underestimated, and until 1987 no one
has ever tried to study this systemati-
cally,” Dr. Tucker said. “The satellite
data are also there for other areas.
There are no technical constraints.
They just have not been processed

surface.

Respiratory Disease Rises

In August and September in past
years, when the thick haze over the re-
gion worsened, it has forced airports to
close down, caused boat accidents on

the rivers and brought a rise in respira-

tory diseases.

Early this month, the annual drama
of fire came to the fore as burning
spread from a farm in Mato Grosso
and set ablaze a national park, the
Parques das Emas. The 335,000-acre
park, which consists of easily flamma~
ble savannas rich in animal life, has
only four wardens, who have been un-
able to maintain the fire corridor. The
blaze lasted five days and, according to
the forestry service, has destroyed 65
percent of the park.

As forestry experts explain it, spon-
taneous fires are rare in the moist rain
forest. Rather, workers fiPst cut the
trees, leave them to dry and finally set
fire to them during the dry season.
Usually only the felled part is dry
enough to burn, and fires remain con-
fined to the intended areas. In the ab-
sence of transport or roads, the timber
cannot be sold, and burning is the easi-
est way to clear the land.

In the computer room at the Space
Research Center here, researchers
capture and analyze the satellite

 

images every day. Marcos Pereira, one
of the analysts, explained that the
satellite registers the fires as points of
intense heat. These appear as dots on
the screen and permit researchers to
pinpoint their location. Often, the omi-
nous dots form a belt showing the
boundary between the virgin forest and
the settled areas. “It is very striking
how the fires follow the roads,” an
American researcher said.

170,000 Fires in 1987

On the worst day of 1987, Sept. 9, the
satellite detected 7,603 fires. Dr. Setzer
said that between June and October
1987, covering the whole dry season,
the satellite registered more than

350,000 fires. Because burnings may
last between 24 and 48 hours, many
fires may have been registered more
than once, Dr. Setzer said. Therefore,
he added, his group is using a conserva-
tive estimate of 170,000 fires for 1987.

As part of the new program, re-
searchers send their findings every
day to the National Forestry Service in
Brasilia. Shocked by last year’s data,
the service has said that this year it
will open a nationwide campaign and
levy large fines for the burnings. Virtu-
ally all the fires are conducted illegal-
ly, without the required permits.

But the service, which. guards the
largest forest on earth, has fewer than
900 wardens for a region larger than
Europe. “We would need 15,000 to
20,000 guards to be effective,” said Car-
105 Marx Carneiro, a director of the
service.

We Must Stop Backing
Environmental Ruin

 

To the Editor:

Your report linking man-made
fires in the Amazon basin with the
warming of the earth’s atmosphere
contributes to public awareness of
this real threat to our environment
(front page, Aug. 12). In my work on
the Foreign Operations Subcommit-
tee of the Senate Appropriations
Committee, I have been shocked to
learn the extent to which the United
States has actually subsidized this

kind of environmental devastation.

If we’re serious about preventing
the global greenhouse effect from
becoming a disastrous reality, we
have to go to the source —- and make
sure our development lending stops
financing environmentally ruinous
projects. I worked last fall to incorpo-
rate these environmental concerns in
our foreign operations budget.

The specter of the greenhouse ef-
feet will not be laid fully to rest until
these concerns become an integral
part of America’s foreign assistance
policy. ROBERT W. KASTEN JR.

The Burning of Rondonia

A calamitous cycle of destruction is unfolding
in Rondonia, the heavily forested Amazon province
in western Brazil. The tragedy is a lesson to Brazil
and to the international agencies that finance its
projects that heedless development can wreak
havoc with the global environment, not just Brazil’s.

DCattle ranchers and thousands of landless
settlers recently brought in by the Government are
torching the tropical forest to clear the land.

1:] The fires are so extensive that they add ap-
preciably to the global pollution that now may be
warming the earth’s climate.

D The richly diverse forest, ancient home to a
fifth of the world’s plant and animal species, is
being destroyed irreversibly, and its Amerindian in-
habitants are dying from imported diseases.

[3 Stripped of the trees that recycle forest nutri-
ents, the soil yields only a few years’ crops before
the settlers move on, to destroy more forest.

A new picture of the damage has emerged from
a NASA satellite sensitive to heat sources. Scien-
tists at Brazil’s Space Research Center, Marlise
Simons has reported in The Times, have counted
170,000 fires last year in the western Amazon.

The fires contribute twice over to the green-
house effect, the feared warming of the world’s cli-
mate that may already have begun in the recent
string of hot summers. They contribute fully one-
tenth of the global production of carbon dioxide, the
principal greenhouse gas. And once the forest is
burned, it can no longer absorb carbon dioxide from
the air and turn it back into vegetation.

Despite the richness and diversity of tropical
forests, their soil is mostly poor. Shielded from the
recurrent ice ages that repeatedly extinguished life
in temperate zones, the animals and plants of the
tropics have had millions of years in which to de-
velop new species and complex interdependencies.
The living systems now being destroyed in Brazil
are the flower of some 50 million years of evolution.

Cattle ranchers, responsible for 80 percent of
the destruction, receive sizable tax breaks. Without
such subsidies, the cattle ranches are “inherently
uneconomic,” writes Robert Repetto of the World
Resources Institute. Besides the ranchers, half a
million settlers have invaded the Rondonian forest

along the new Cuiabé-Pdrto Velho road, paved with
a $250 million World Bank loan. The Bank’s re-
quests for protection of the forests and their tribes
were ignored. Since the road was paved, the area of

destroyed forest has tripled. Rondonia, endowed
with one of the world’s richest ecosystems, is al-
ready 17 percent deforested.

The tragedy is that the forest could be pre-
served even as its resources are tapped. Permanent
crops like coffee bushes do less damage than annual
cropping or cattle. The valuable hardwood trees
could be harvested instead of burned. Migrant set-
tlers would hunger less for forest land if Brazil.
redistributed the 43 percent of its arable land now
owned by just 1 percent of its population.

The World Bank has learned from the disaster
of the Rondonia road, but it and other lending agen-
cies need to ensure that Brazil shares the lesson.

An imaginative scheme of debt-for—nature
swaps has been devised by Thomas Lovejoy of the
World Wildlife Fund: the fund raises money to buy
up the dollar—denominated debt of countries like Bo-
livia, Ecuador and Costa Rica, which it exchanges
for local currencies to 'be used in establishing na-
ture preserves.

By such means, the headlong devastation of
Rondonia can perhaps be halted before it becomes a
wasteland that serves only to fuel the global green-
house effect. The destruction of the Amazon forest
IS a crime from which no one benefits.

Thousands of Amazon Acres Burning
Clearing Practices Threaten Western Hemisphere ’8 Air Quality

 

By Mac Margolis

Special to The Washmgtmt Post

ALTA FLORESTA, Brazil—In
the Brazilian Amazon, the vast for-
est land that takes- its name from
the continent’s largest river, there
are now three distinct seasons. Two
of them, the rainy and the dry sea-
sons, are nature’s doing, ancient as
the tropical rain forest itself. The
third is new and the handiwork of
the earth’s most destructive tenant,
man.

Brazilians call this season the
queimadas, the burnings, a volatile
interregnum between the dry and
wet seasons, when small farmers
and armies of peons employed by
land barons set fires to clear the
land of scrub and jungle.

They are a legacy of slash-and-
burn agriculture, a method of clear-
ing land practiced by many South
American Indians. Yet as the Bra-
zilian government has pursued its
own manifest destiny and waves Of
white settlers have pushed into the
jungle to the north, the scale of
burnings has gotten out of hand.

Tens of thousands of acres of
Brazil's jungle forests and scrub
lands are being laid waste by fires,
set by small landholders, cattle
ranchers and plantation owners who
do not have the money, or are in too
much of a hurry, to cut down the
wood, according to Brazilian scien-
tists and government officials.

The fires, intended to clear land
for planting and pastures, will de-
stroy 80,000 square miles of forest
this year, an area larger than Den-
mark, Belgium, Austria and Swit-
zerland combined. The smoke
plumes, rising up to three miles,
will foul the atmosphere with mil-
lic-ns of tons of particulate matter
and carbon dioxide, researchers at
the Sao Paulo-based Institute for
Space Research estimate.

 

Scientists say the nearly 5,000
daily fires set between July and 0c-
tober not only ravage forests of the
Amazon basin but contribute signif-
icantly to air pollution in the West-
ern Hemisphere.

But it does not take a science de
gree to appreciate the devastation
wrought by the burnings. The dam-
age was all too evident on a recent

trip to this frontier town in Mato '

Grosso State, on the Bolivian bor-
der. Alta Floresta is Portuguese for
“high forest,” which, thanks to the
autumn fires and buzz saws of about
600 lumber mills, is vanishing at an
alarming rate.

A twin-engine Fokker aircraft
droned lazy circles through a sky
choked with acrid smoke while the
pilot strained to find a runway a
mere 20 stories below. After 30
minutes of searching in vain, the
pilot, in what has become a daily
ritual, was forced to land at an al-
ternative airstrip and wait for hours
until the “dry clouds” dissipated.

Along vast stretches of major
roads, 3 gantlet of ﬂames licked at
the trees and brush. Farther on,
entire stands have become denuded
fields. strewn with smoldering
stumps and ashen boughs. Embers
and soot floated eerily to earth, like
black snow or the detritus of some
invisible factory smoke-stack.

The seasonal burnings have in-
creased as small landholders and
big ranchers have advanced into
Brazil’s northern frontier. Vast
swaths of forest have been cleared
to make way for soybean planta-
tions, to feed local saw mills and for
cattle pastures. Many developers
have enjoyed tax breaks and gov-
ernment incentives to topple the
forests.

But only in the last two years
have scientists been able to docu-
ment the full impact of the autumn

blazes. A recently released report
by the Institute for Space Research,
drawing on weather satellite images
gathered during an 80-day period
last year, “conservatively esti-
mated” that 80,000 square miles of
forest, or 4 percent of the entire

Amazon region, was burned be?

tween July and October of 1987.
Some states, where pioneer set-
tlement and road building have
been intense, lost enormous por-
tions of their forests in just a few
months. Para State lost 18.7 per-
cent and Rondonia 8.9 percent, for
example. The burning released 620

 

 

million tons of carbon gas and par-
ticulate matter into the atmos-
phere.

“This phenomenon . . . will cer-
tainly be linked in the near future to
atmospheric alterations of our plan-
et, and quite probably to the prob-
lem of the [depletion of] the Ant-
arctic Ozone, where the winds
transport the emissions from the
burnings,” the report states.

The report concludes, “The
dense smoke produced by the Am-
azonian burnings, at the height of
the season, spread over millions of
square kilometers, bringing health
problems to the population, shut-
ting down airports, hampering air
traffic, causing various accidents on
riverways and on roads, and pollut-
ing the earth’s atmosphere in gen-
eral.”

Dr. Alberto Setzer, a space in-
stitute researcher who holds a doc-

torate in environmental engineering
from Purdue University, said the
seasonal fires could contribute to
the so-called “greenhouse effect,”
superheating the earth’s atmos-
phere, which could alter world
weather patterns and, in the ex-
treme, melt the polar ice caps,
causing oceans to rise drastically.

The space research agency is
monitoring this year’s Amazon
burning closely and alerting the au-
thorities, but the government has
been slow to react. “We have had
only a small impact on policy,” la-
mented Setzer.

The burnings and the impotence
of authorities to contain them have
also sparked pelitical protest in Bra-
zil and touched off a crossfire of
criticism among government agen-
cies.

Pioneers in Brazil’s Amazon basin clear forest land through the traditional, but air-polluting, slash-and-burn method.

 




(continued)

Much of the blame has fallen to
the Brazilian Institute for Forestry
Development, frequently accused of
being ineffectual and indifferent be-
fore the destruction of the rain for-
est. The forestry institute’s presi-

dent, Antonio Jose Guimaraes, ad- ‘

mitted on a nationwide television
show that the agency is all but pow-
erless to contain the fires. He noted
the agency is chronically under-
funded and understaffed, with only
600 inspectors, of whom only 170
are assigned to the 2 million square
miles of Amazonia. The agency's
budget, $11 million for this year,
represents only 6 percent of the
Ministry of Agriculture’s total rev-
enues.

Privately, forestry officials admit
that low penalties and lax inspection
have created an anything-goes cli-
mate in the hinterlands, where en-
vironmental laws are routinely ig-
nored. Although the forestry agen-
cy requires that all lumber compa-
nies maintain a reserve of standing
forest, one high-level agency official
returning from an inspection tour in
southern Brazil said, “90 percent of
the lumberers didn’t have any re-
serve at all. They cut everything
down.”

Asked about the extent of the
burnings in Mato Grosso State, the
secretary for environment, Jose
Rodrigues Goncalves, stood up and
pointed out his office window. Near-
by, next to the secretariat's parking
lot, an acre of brush was burning.
Smoke seeped through the air con-
ditioning and into Goncalves’s of-

fice, and ash settled on the coffee .

table.

Delegates of the forestry insti-
tute and federal police agents held
separate meetings last week to
draw up new regulations and dis-
cuss stiffer penalties for ranchers
who set illegal fires. But few are
convinced that new rules will offer
much protection to the forest.

Does greenhouse
make sea bloom?

g1 Robert C. Cowen

HIS summer’s toxic algae bloom in the

North Sea that cost ﬁshermen several

hundred million dollars in lost catches
also gave a new perspective on climatic
warming.

Marine biologist Victor Smetacek of the Al-
fred Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime
Research in Bremerhaven, West Germany, says
the air’s rising enrichment with carbon dioxide
(C02) may be partly responsible for the abnor-
mally lush algae growth.

CO? - the most important of the climate-
warmmg gases — is a plant nutrient. Algae, like
all green plants, convert it into carbohydrates
Via photosynthesis. Thus air enriched in C02,
plus possible temperature changes related to

climatic warming, could encourage such algae '

bloonung.

This, of course, is speculation. But it does
point up the fact that a rise of one to several
degrees in our planet’s average surface tem-
perature is not the most important aspect of the

 

 

 

greenhouse warming. The main impact is likely
to appear in a variety of subtle ways that have
major biological effects.

A team of NASA and Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology climate modelers empha-
sizes this in connec-
tion with a new global
11an study it pub- RESEARCH
' ed in the Au . 20
issue of the J ourngal of NOTEBOOK
Geophysical Re-
search. Led by James Hansen, director of
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
the team has run new computer simulations of
possible climatic eﬂ’ects of that warming over
the next 70 years. These suggest, among other
changes, that the probability of a hot summer is
likely to rise above 50 percent in the 19903,
compared with about 33 percent in the past.

Commenting on such changes over such a
short time span, the scientists say, “We empha-
sue that it is the possibility of rapid climate
change which is of most concern for the bio-
sphere;. there may not be sufﬁcient time for
many biosystems to adapt to the rapid changes
forecast. . . .”

This is a warning we should heed. Climate
simulations like this are not deﬁnitive. The
computations can’t take account of all relevant
factors. Yet they do provide useful insight.

Project Cohmap (Cooperative Holocene
Mapping Project) at the University of Wis-
consin’s Center for Climatic Research is testing
the ability of computer modeling to mimic past
climate changes. In a major study covering the
past 18,000 years published in the Aug. 26
issue of Science, the Cohmap team concludes
that “climate models have fair skill in simulat-
ing the broad geographic patterns of atmos-
pheric circulation, temperature, and moisture.”

So, while simulations such as those run by
Hansen and his colleagues may not be perfect,
they do have credibility. They are good enough
to put us on notice that, whatever speciﬁc
climatic changes lie ahead, these will come fast
enough to cause severe strain to the biosphere.

We have scarcely begun to suspect the many
and often subtle ways in which this strain will
appear. Lost crops and shifts of agricultural
belts are only the most obvious of the possibili-
ties.

In spite of the step—up in climatic research
now under way, little work is being done on the
possible ecological effects of climate change.
Such work is badly needed.

Algae on the beach

TALIAN scientists and politicians meet this
week to discuss ways to deal with a plague of
algae rotting along Italy’s eastern coast. A gela-

Adriatic beaches two weeks ago, causing a stench
that drove away tourists.

Scientists of the University of Bologna’s
manne station at Cesenatico, on the Adriatic, say
that the algae have proliferated because of the
unusually hot, calm weather in the
Mediterranean this summer, not because of
pollution. However, local governments are seek-

carries waste and sewage to the Adriatric from
the industrial area around Milan. They fear that
tourists will desert polluted resorts.

U .8. Areas May
Be lst Victims of
Warming Earth

By THOMAS H. MAUGH II,
Times Science Writer

The Midwest farm belt and the
southeastern United States will be
among the first regions of the
Earth to feel the effects of “green—
house" warming caused by the
release of car-hon dioxide and other
gases into the atmosphere, accord—
ing to predictions of a new comput-
er model of the atmosphere devel-
oped at the NASA—Goddard
Institute for Space Studies in New
York City.

The model allows scientists, for
the first time, to predict the effects
of greenhouse warming over the
next 10 to 20 years rather than 50 to
70 years in the future, as is‘the case
with previous models, according to
atmospheric physicist Anthony'Del
Genio of Goddard.

California Gets a} Reprieve

By identifying which regions will
be first to warm up, the model may
enable scientists to observe the
first stages of the greenhouse effect
and give them a better idea of how
to deal with it. Other regions of
early warming predicted by the
model include the East Indies. the
Bay of Bengal in India, the Mongo-
lian -Manchurian region of Asia and
both polar regions.

The model also predicts that
California and the Pacific Coast will
be among the last regions to be
affected by greenhouse warming,
lagging behind the rest of the
country by perhaps 25 years.

Surprisingly, the model also pre-
dicts that even in the highly un-
likely event that the release of
carbon dioxide and other so-called
greenhouse gases were to be halted
immediate! y, the Earth would con -
tinue to grow warmer for at least 1.3
years. “it takes the Earth a while to
respond to the gases that are

already there," Del Genio said.

The computer model was devel—
oped by a team led by Climatologist
James E. Hansen and is described
in the current Journal of Geophysi-
cal Research—Atmospheres.

Hansen made national headlines
in June when he told a Senate
committee that the heat and
drought afflicting the Midwest rep-
resented the first stages of the
greenhouse effect. That conclusion
Was based on both the computer
model and the observation that
four of the hottest years on record
have occurred during the 19808.

Many other researchers argue
that the drought was caused by
normal climatic variability rather
than by the greenhouse effect. But
few would question the conclusion
that greenhouse warming is immi-
nenL

The climatological effects of car--
bon dioXide and similar gases have
been recognized since the late
18005. Such gases allow the sun’s
light to reach the Earth’s surface
and warm it, but absorb heat that
would otherwise be radiated into
space—thus trapping heat. ‘

The amount of carbon dioxide in
the Earth’s atmosphere has grown
from about 270 parts per million in
the mid-18005 to about 350 parts
per million now. A 1983 National
Academy of Sciences report pre-
dicted that the level could reach
600 parts per million within 50 to
100 years if the use of fossil fuels
continued to grow at then-current

Such warming could cause a
marked change in weather pat-
terns, including a northward shift
of precipitation. It could also cause
a melting of the polar icecaps,

accompanied by an increase in the

oceans’ level and coastal flooding.

Hansen and his colleagues used
their model to study three different
scenarios: continued rapid growth
in the release of greenhouse gases;
curtailed growth of release rates
and no increase in release rates.

In the first case, they calculated
that the Earth’s temperature would
rise by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit in
the next 20 years. If growth in
release rates were curtailed, 25
years would be required for a
similar temperature increase.

And even with no increase in
growth rates, the average global
temperature would probably climb
by 08 degrees within the next 15
years, they said. That increase
would bring the Earth's tempera-
ture to the peaks reached during
the Altithermal and Eemian peri-
ods 6,000 and 120,000 years ago.

The model identified regions of

these effects combine to produce
high-pressure regions off the At—
lantic and Pacific coasts.

Because winds flow clockwise
around a high-pressure region,
they would bring warm air from
equatorial regions into the South-

east and Midwest. Similar winds.

around the Pacific high would
bring cool. Arctic air to California.
In each of the three scenarios,
the researchers wrote, greenhouse
warming “should be clearly identi-
fiable in the 1990s." And for the
first twp.....reges, the predicted
warming-rate of about 0.9 degrees
per decade is a much faster change
than any in the historical record,
they said. “There may not be

sufficient time for many biosys—
tems to adapt to the rapid changes -
forecast. . . ,”they wrote.

The researchers .also warned
that the frequency of extreme
weather events could be more
dangerous to the biosphere than
the increase in average tempera-
ture. They note, for example, that
Omaha, Neb., has experienced a
run of at least five days with
temperatures above 95 degrees on—
1y three times per decade, on
average. The model predicts that
the number will increase to five
times per decade in the 19908 and
seven times per decade by 2020.

Such runs of high temperature
are very damaging to both crops
and humans, Hansen warned.

American politicians warm to greenhouse effect

ROPHESIES of global warming are
winning over politicians in the US
and creating a movement to curb the

country’s craving for fossil fuel. The most
outspoken scientist studying the green-
house effect has issued his strongest
warning yet, in the Journal of Geophysical
Research.

James Hansen, of NASA’s Goddard
Institute for Space Studies in New York,
said that within a few decades, temperature
changes “will become large enough to have
major effects on the quality of life for
mankind in many regions”.

Hansen leapt ahead of the scientiﬁc
mainstream three months ago by stating
that the drought that affected the US this
summer was probably due to the green-
house effect (New Scientist, 30 June, p 35).
His claims, derived from his then
unpublished paper, put the greenhouse
effth in the headlines and swayed many
politicians. “They didn’t realise that this
issue is going to be on their plates” during
the coming elections, says Michael
Oppenheimer, a physicist with the Envi-
ronmental Defense Fund in New York.

George Bush, the Republican presiden-
tial candidate, last week declared himself
“an environmentalist” at a speech in Mich-
igan. He remarked on how hot the summer

 

Christopher Joyce, Washington DC

had been, promised to convene an inter-
national conference on the environment
and said it was time to act to halt acid rain.

Cutting consumption of fossil fuels that
emit carbon dioxide is the main aim of the
greenhouse movement. Its champion in
Congress is Senator Timothy Wirth of
Colorado. Wirth introduced legislation in
July to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by
20 per cent by 2000 and to rejuvenate
research on alternative forms of energy.

Already, the US generates more than
one-ﬁfth of the world’s emissions. About
half the globe’s warming because of human
activities is due to carbon dioxide. Other
trace gases also contribute to warming:
methane accounts for 20 per cent, chloro-
ﬂuorocarbons another 15 per cent and
nitrous oxide 10 per cent. Since the mid-
19th century, global concentrations of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have
increased by 25 per cent.

The US government’s programme of
research into alternative forms of energy
has been slowly declining during Ronald
Reagan’s administration. The Department
of Energy’s budget for conservation has
dropped by more than half, to $156 million
between 1980 and 1988.

 

Wirth’s bill would infuse $450 million
into the development of renewable sources
of energy during the ﬁrst two years of the
1990s. He also wants to convene an inter-
national conference on how to cut harmful
emissions.

Several coalitions have either taken up
the greenhouse banner or have been
created to force it onto the electoral agenda
this year. These include the Alliance to
Save Energy, the Energy Conservation
Coalition, the Fund for Renewable Energy
and the Environment, and the American
Council for an Energy-Efﬁcient Economy.
Wirth has presented the Democratic presi-
dential candidate, Michael Dukakis, with
scientiﬁc evidence of global warming.

Concern over the threat from carbon
dioxide has rekindled some support for
nuclear energy and with it some of the argu-
ments last heard in the 19705. For example,
should nuclear reactors replace coal-ﬁred
power stations? A letter in Science on
26 August, from experts at the Rocky
Mountain Institute in Colorado, says no.
Bill Keepin and Gregory Kats write that a
dollar invested in making electrical appli-
ances more efﬁcient displaces 50 kilowatt
hours of coal-ﬁred electricity. A dollar put
into a nuclear plant will displace a mere
7-4 kilowatt hours of coal power. [1

developed mathematical
models to predict how much
and how fast the increase in
global pollutants will warm the
planet. “We’re the ﬁrst ones to - -
run a model with a year-by-
year increase of carbon dioxide
to see how quickly tempera-
ture increases,” he says. Most
other models have simply
calculated what the temp—
erature would be if concen-
trations of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere were to double
overnight.

average. Europe and western
states of the US will warm
more slowly than the average
during the next decade or 50.

Among the many effects of a
rise in temperatures of around
0-5 °C per decade is a shift in
temperature and vegetation
belts towards the poles of
perhaps 50 to 75 kilometres
per decade. That is about 10
times as fast as most plants and
trees have been observed to
migrate in the geological
record.

Hansen has assumed some
absorption of heat by oceans
and some vertical mixing of
heated surface waters with
deeper ocean currents. He

 

 

Hansen described how “he has ‘0'4 I

run his model using three
scenarios for possible future
emissions: These scenarios,
shown on the graph, are:

A: Trace gas emissions continue to grow
at current rates of about 1-5 per cent
annually, producing an escalating
“forcing effect” for global warning;

B: The growth rate slows so that the
forcing effect remains constant;

C: Drastic cuts in emissions over the next
10 years cause the forcing effect to cease
growing by 2000.

Hansen predicts that, whatever we do
now, over the next few decades, mean
temperatures will match or exceed the
highest levels during the past few inter-
glaCIal periods. The world will probably
be on average 0-5 °C warmer 15 years
from now and 1°C warmer within 25
years, even if emissions of carbon dioxide

and other trace gases are cut back.

Weather has its own natural variability,
and an unusually warm summer is not
necessarily cause for alarm. But by the
19905, the rise in mean temperatures will
exceed the natural range.

Hansen describes the chances of an
abnormally hot summer thus: until now,
hot summers happen two years in every
six. According to his calculations, by the
19905 they will occur in the US three or
four times every six years.

The ﬁrst places to show signiﬁcant
warming, says Hansen, will be tropical
oceans, China and the interior areas in
Asia, and ocean areas near Antarctica and
the North Pole. In the US, the east will
warm up somewhat more than the

warns that several phenomena,
some still poorly understood,
could inﬂuence the degree of
warming, especially as the
global climate changes. These include
volcanic eruptions; “changes in the
amount and distribution of clouds, which

reduce warming; and variations in solar
radiation.

The model’s results could be askew by
as much as 50 per cent, says Hansen.
“Obviously that’s not as good as you’d
like. But if the effects do show up in the
19905, that will help us check our model,”
he says.

Even half the predicted temperature
change would alter climate. “My point
is that although there are still large
uncertainties, we should do things to
reduce greenhouse effects,” says
Hansen. [:1

‘ Galilee Fishermen .
Suspected of Using
Poison for Easy Catch

JERUSALEM (Ab—Thousands of
dead fish were found floating in the
Jordan River, possibly poisoned by
fishermen on the Sea of Galilee
looking for an easy catch, an
official said Friday.

“We suspect large-scale poison-
ing using agricultural pesticides,”
said Elad Zohar, an Israeli area
supervisor.

Zohar said the pesticides appar-
ently were dumped in the Sea of
Galilee and killed more fish than
the fishermen could catch. Thou-
sands of the poisoned fish then
ﬂoated from the fresh water lake
into the narrow, winding Jordan
River, he said.

“The damage caused by the
poisoning is very great," Zohar
said. “For every fish caught, three
others are rotting and washing
ashore.”

In addition, those caught still
carry the poison in their systems.
Israel Radio broadcast a warning,
saying fresh water fish should not
be eaten.

Zohar blamed the poisoning on
“marginal elements" among the
Sea of Galilee’s 180 commercial
fishermen-

Blockages 1n wombs and fallopian tubes
were evident in Baltic seals as well as in
some mammals 1n the area of the Skagerrak
and Kattegat. Reijnders believes the block-
ages were caused by scarring after the seals
miscarried embryos. He suggests PCBs
suppress the hormones oestradiol and
progesterone, leading to miscarriages. Since
the endocrine system also governs immune
respone, Reijnders suggests there may be a
link in this evidence.

The report noted that high levels of PCBs
appear to affect reproduction in seals but
not in other wildlife. In an experiment
carried out on the Isle of May, Scotland,
artiﬁcially raised levels of PCBs in pufﬁns
showed no effects either on breeding
success or on longevity.

Latest estimates from very incomplete
data suggest around 3- 3 tonnes of PCBs
empty into the North Sea every year, half
from the river Weser. Much of 1t also comes
from the Ems, the Elbe and the Rhine.
Incineration of the materials at high
temperatures is the only safe way to dispose
of them, but it will take many years to
destroy the whole stockpile.

last November, the states bordering the
North Sea agreed to introduce measures to
halve the input of pesticides and PCBs into
the sea within seven years. Even if PCBs, or

other pollutants, are shown to weaken the
seals to the point where they fall ill and die,
new controls will do little to ease the effects
on wildlife caused by existing pollution.
PCBs remain unchanged in the environ-
ment for decades, perhaps longer.
Scientists participating in the North Sea
project still do not know why the seals

should suddenly have become 111. Accord- ‘

ing to marine ecologists 1n Texel, the bloom
of poisonous algae off Norway in May
could have been related to the heavy rains
and warmth of the past winter, which
increased the load of organic nutrients in
the North Sea.

But there is no clear evidence that algae
increase the speed at which PCBs reach the
food chain. The pollutants attach them-
selves to tiny grains in the sea bed such as
clay and are released when animals or
currents disturb them. C]

THE NEW YORK TIMES

Canine Virus Tied to Seal D '

 

By STEVE 1.01111

 

Special to The New York Times

LONDON, Aug. 29 — A team of
Dutch scientists announced today
that they had identified an animal
virus' that more commonly infects
dogs'as the causeof the puzzling epi-
demic that has killed more than 7,000
seals this year in. the North Sea and
the Baltic.

The Dutch researchers, led by Dr.
Albert Osterhaus, a veterinary virolo-
gist at Holland’ 5 National Institute of
Public Health and Environmental
Protection, have also deVeloped a
vaccine in conjunction With Swedish
scientists to combat the virus, canine
distemper virus.

“But it’s no cure, ” Dr. Osterhaus
said in a telephone interview. “It will
be effective only in animals that have
not yet been infected.”

Moreover, wildlife specialists and
veterinarians caution that it would be
virtuall impossible to vaccinate
much 0 the healthy seal population in
the North Sea. Healthy seals are very
difficult to trap for inoculation and,
they add, extensive use of a vaccine
on animals could have unforeseen ef-
fects on other species in their food
chain.

So the new vaccine, developed with

the aid of Dr. Bror Morein of the Uni-

 

Cha 11 reaction .

Although a vaccine
has been developed,
experts say it will be
of limited use.

 

versity of Uppsala in Sweden, will be
administered mainly to animals in
sanctuaries to replenish the seal
population. To date, 50 doses of the
vaccine have been administered to
animals at a seal sanctuary in Pieter-
buren, the Netherlands, Dr. Oster-
haus said.

The identity of the virus behind the
epidemic was a surprise. Veterinary
experts, including Dr. Osterhaus, at
first suspected herpes and picorna vi-
ruses, having found them in some dis-
eased seals. But subsequent tests
found that antibodies to those viruses
were present in a comparatively
small proportion of infected seals.

The suggestion to look for canine
distemper virus came from Dr. An-
ders Bergman, a Swedish veterinary
pathologist, one of several foreign
specialists with whom the Dutch
team was cooperating. “it was clear
the disease picture was exactly the

sit

same as in dogs, ” Dr. Bergman said
today 1n Stockholm.

The disease, apparently transmit-
ted through coughing, displays many
of the same symptoms in seals as in
dogs: watering eyes, thick nasal dis;
charge, inflamation of the lungs, liver

- and intestines, and lesions in the

nervous system.

The Dutch group has led an inter-
national effort against the deadly epi-
demic. Blood samples have been
taken from hundreds of seals in the
Netherlands, West Germany,
Sweden, Denmark and Britain, be.
fore, during and after the animals
contracted the disease. The results
showed that virtually all the diseased
animals had developed antibodies to
the canine distemper virus. Dr. Os-
terhaus said that seals tested in .
previous years in the North Sea did
not possess those antibodies.

Dr. Osterhaus said seal blood-
serum samples from Greenland indi-
cated that the animals there might
have been the first to contract the dis-
ease, probably from dogs. It is highly
unlikely that humans could get the
disease, he added.

The Dutch- research will be pub-
lished Thursday 1n the British journal
Nature.

Still unclear is the part, if any, that
pollution may have played in the seal
epidemic.

that a form of canine dis-

He told New Scientist: “We
think that pollution has played
a role because we have seen

seals has deteriorated greatly in
the past ﬁve years.” He said
that he had received no guar-

supplement the 50 000 European Currency

months ago and for which £500 000 had
already been earmarked.

Canine distemper spreads rapidly and
kills a high proportion of animals that have
not been exposed to it before. It could have
been spread by dogs biting seals or cough—
ing on them, according to Osterhaus, but
there is no evidence for this yet.

The virus suppresses the immune system
of animals by attacking their white blood
cells. However, animals whose immune
systems are already suppressed are most
susceptible to the disease, according to
John Baker, a veterinary pathologist at
Liverpool University.

Scientists believe that the seals transmit
the disease directly from one to another on
droplets when sneezing or coughing.
Harwood says that the illness changes the
behaviour of common seals, who swim to
places that they do not normally visit.

A common seal regularly travels about
50 kilometres a day in search of food. The
infection that has so far reached the
common seals in the Wash on the east coast
of England may, therefore, have spread to
the colonies on the Tay and the Moray
Firth in Scotland. Reports of dead
common seals in the Orkneys were coming
in last week. More dead seals of both
species have washed ashore all around
Britain, including 38 on the shores of the
Irish Sea. However, scientists have only
confirmed distemper in seals from the
Wash. A spokeswoman for the Sea
Mammal Research Unit said the other
deaths could be unconnected with the
disease.

Harwood says that a colony of 7000 grey
seals on the Fame Islands off northeast

travelling regularly

 

Seal studies stumble through lack of money

England could carry the disease north. Five
dead grey seals had been washed up there,
he said last week.

Grey seals with the disease appear to
suffer the same breathing difﬁculties and
lethargy that affect common seals, but so
far, there have been few deaths. If this
changes, Harwood says, it will
pose a serious risk to the
species. Britain’s 100 000 grey
seals make up half the world’s
total.

Baker has examined more
than 50 seals from British
waters. He has found “a
variety of conditions unasso-
ciated with the current North
Sea problem”. He has received
23 corpses of grey seals since
March from the Dee estuary
where normally he would
expect to receive about two.
The examinations showed “no
speciﬁc infection” but “suggest
some increase in susceptibility
to infection”, he said.

The experiments to establish
what, if any, link exists
between persistent pollutants
such as polychlorinated bi-
phenyls (PCBs) and damage to
the immune systems of seals
will cost at least £150 000 and
could take between one and three years,
according to Dutch scientists involved. The
first experiment will attempt to test the
immune responses of seals exposed to an
infective agent, such as tetanus.

It will compare the levels of antibodies
produced in response to the agent in the
blood of seals exposed to heavy pollution
with those in seals exposed to little or none.
Peter Reijnders, a marine ecologist from
the Dutch Research Institute for Nature
Management in Texel, who will collaborate
in the tests, hopes to use samples of blood
cultured in vitro.

He also plans to feed seals in captivity
with fish from polluted and unpolluted
waters and compare their resistance to
infection. This would repeat the technique
usedby Reijnders in 1986 which estab—
lished a link between PCBs and infertility
in common seals (New Scientist, 11
December 1986, p 20).

Jeff Vos, an immunotoxicologist at
Bilthoven, has found that PCBs suppress
the production of T-cells in laboratory rats
(New Scientist, 18 August, p 23). He says
that T-cells play an important role in the
response of the immune system to the
distemper virus. He will take part in the
proposed experiments.

The second experiment will try to estab-
lish exactly which, if any, of the 100 or so
PCBs may be responsible—or whether
several act together to harm seals. This will
be ex ensive—a sample of seal blubber
costs £1500 to analyse for different PCBs.

A report drawn up for last November’s
conference on the North Sea in London
identified varying concentrations of PCBs
in different grey seal colonies. >

Common seals in the Dutch Wadden
Sea showed higher levels of PCBs in their
tissue than British grey seals, though the
most serious problems, according to the
report, “appear to occur in the west and
east Frisian Wadden Sea which receives
high loads of pollutants from the Rhine and
Dutch industrial areas”. The report also
noted high levels of PCBs in the flesh
of seals from the coast of Schleswig-
Holstein and the Danish Wadden Sea.

Vast Amazon Fires,

Man-Made, Linked
To Global Warming

 

By MARLISE SIMONS
Special to The New York Times

SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil,
Aug. 6 — Like eerie ghosts of the trees
and animals dying below, thick clouds
of smoke are rising over the rain forest
as the man-made fires of the annual
dry season are once again upon the
Amazon.

On some days, fires rage in thou-
sands of places across the vast Ama-
zon basin, following a broad belt where
settlers and farmers are beating back
the jungle frontier. For many, fire is
the only tool for transforming forest
into farm or pasture.

From the flames, tons of fumes and
particles are hurled into the sky, and at
night, roaring and red, the forest looks
to be at war.

Now, Brazilian and American scien-
tists in a new satellite monitoring pro-
gram are for the first time pinpointing
and measuring the effects of the fires
The destruction and burning of forest
here is so vast, the scientists say, that is
may account for at least one-tenth of
the global manmade output of carbon
dioxide, which is believed to be causing
a warming of the earth through the
greenhouse effect. Burning of fossil
fuels acCounts for most of the carbon
dioxide released worldwide.

EnvirOnmentalists have long warned
of the destruction that is increasing
with each new dry season, and wit-
nesses every year report more ceme-
teries of trees. The scientists’ findings
show that in 1987 the burnings ruined
more forest cover than previously
thought and proved to be major pollut-
ers of the earth's atmosphere.

In 1987, Brazilian scientists estimate,
fires just in Brazil’s part of the Ama-
zon basin covered 77,000 square miles,
an area one and a half times the size of
New York State. Of these, at least
30,000 square miles were newly felled
virgin forest, the researchers said. The
remainder, they added, involved re-
grown forest on on previously cleared
land, savannas and fields.

of miles. This has raised questions
about a possible link between the gi-
gantic emissions from the fires in the
South American tropics and the dam-
age to the earth’s protective ozone
shield over Antarctica.

Smoke Rises to 12,000 Feet

Alberto Setzer, coordinator of the
satellite data at the Space Research
Center in this south Brazilian city, said
smoke clouds from the Amazon fires
often rose to 12,000 feet. Their gases
and particles were then lifted up higher
into jet streams and blown south
across the South Atlantic, close to Ant-

 

arctica. Many scientists now believe

that several of these gases, including
methane and nitrogen oxides, are
among the reactive gases that can di-
rectly or indirectly deplete ozone, Dr.
Setzer said.

“There is no proof yet that the ma-
terial is interacting with the ozone
shield, which is much higher in the
stratosphere,” said Dr. Setzer. “But we
know the material gets to the Antarctic
region, and we know that storms can
pump it upward. We do not know yet
how high it reaches. Several people are
working on this.”

American scientists who took part in

the mission over Antarctica by the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration in October said they had not
searched for or found evidence of com-
pounds from the Amazon. But NASA
researchers are now searching for
such traces by satellite.

But even without the ozone question,
Dr. Setzer said, the “tremendous”
emissions coming off the Amazon pose
serious problems. “They are large
enough to cause significant changes in
the chemical balance of the atmos-
phere and influence the global weath-
er," he said.

A Doubly Harmful Effect

harmful, l)r Setzer .ind other re-
searchers noted. l‘he du'intiing forest
cover becomes not only less efficient in
absorbing and removing this “green-
house gas,” but the fires also add new,
huge volumes of it.

A report prepared by the study group
at the Space Research Center esti-
mated that the fires in Brazil last year
produced carbon dioxide containing
more than 500 million tons of carbon.
The fires also produced 44 million tons
of carbon monoxide, more than six mil-
lion tons of particles, almost five mil-
lion tons of methane, two and a half
million tons of ozone and more than one
million tons of nitrogen oxides and
other substances that can circulate
globally and influence radiation and
climate.

“There is enough to compare it to the
outburst of a very large volcano.” Dr.
Setzer said.

The study results on deforestation
and emissions from the fires so far
cover only the Brazilian two-thirds of
the Amazon rain forest. Still more of
the pollutants are produced by fires in
parts of the Amazon basin outside
Brazil.

a physrcist who is part oi a group
studying deforestation and emissions
at the Goddard Space Hight Center at
Greenbelt, Md. The NASA group, he
said, is now also analyzing satellite

t data of other countries of the Amazon

basin, including Bolivia and Peru,
where burnings have increased.

“This phenomenon has been greatly
underestimated, and until 1987 no one
has ever tried to study this systemati-
cally,” Dr. Tucker said. “The satellite
data are also there for other areas.
There are no technical constraints.
They just have not been processed
yet.”

The effects of the fires are felt
clearly on the ground in areas where
the pace of destruction is greatest, in-

. eluding the state of Para in the eastern

Amazon, and farther west in northern
Mam (irosso and Rondonia Here new
roads have opened, and cattle and soy-
bean farmers are felling huge areas.

Newly analyzed data for the state of
Rondonia, for example, show that in
1984, when paving was completed on a

late last year it had affected 14,600
square miles, or 17 percent of the state
surface.

Respiratory Disease Rises

In August and September in past
years, when the thick haze over the re-
gion worsened, it has forced airports to
close down, caused boat accidents on
the rivers and brought a rise in respira—
tory diseases.

Early this month, the annual drama
of fire came to the fore as burning
spread from a farm in Mato Grosso
and set ablaze a national park, the
Parques das Emas. The 335,000-acre
park, which consists of easily flamma-
ble savannas rich in animal life, has
only four wardens, who have been un-
able to maintain the fire corridor. The
blaze lasted five days and, according to
the forestry service, has destroyed 65
percent of the park.

As forestry experts explain it, spon-
taneous fires are rare in the moist rain
forest. Rather, workers fiPst cut the
trees, leave them to dry and finally set
fire to them during the dry season.
Usually only the felled part is dry
enough to burn, and fires remain con-
fined to the intended areas. In the ab-
sence of transport or roads, the timber
cannot be sold, and burning is the easi-
est way to clear the land.

In the computer room at the Space
Research Center here, researchers
capture and analyze the satellite

 

images every day. Marcos Percira, one
of .the analysts, explained that the
satellite registers the fires as points of
intense heat. These appear as dots on
the screen and permit researchers to
pinpoint their location. Often, the omi-
nous dots form a belt showing the
boundary between the virgin forest and
the settled areas. “It is very striking
how the fires follow the roads,” an
American researcher said.

170,000 Fires in 1987

On the worst day of 1987, Sept. 9, the
satellite detected 7,603 fires. Dr. Setzer
said that between June and October
1987, covering the whole dry season,
the satellite registered more than

350,000 fires. Because burnings may
last between 24 and 48 hours, many
fires may have been registered more
than once, Dr. Setzer said. Therefore,
he added, his group is using a conserva-
tive estimate of 170,000 fires for 1987.

As part of the new program, re-
searchers send their findings every
day to the National Forestry Service in
Brasilia. Shocked by last year’s data,
the service has said that this year it
will open a nationwide campaign and
levy large fines for the burnings. Virtu-
ally all the fires are conducted illegal-
ly, without the required permits.

But the service, which. guards the
largest forest on earth, has fewer than
900 wardens for a region larger than
Europe. “We would need 15,000 to
20,000 guards to be effective,” said Car-
los Marx Carneiro, a director of the
service.

We Must Stop Backing
Environmental Ruin

 

To the Editor:

Your report linking manomade
fires in the Amazon basin with the
warming of the earth’s atmosphere
contributes to public awareness of
this real threat to our environment
(front page, Aug. 12). In my work on
the Foreign Operations Subcommit-
tee of the Senate Appr0priations
Committee, 1 have been shocked to
learn the extent to which the United
States has actually subsidized this

kind of environmental devastation.

If we’re serious about preventing
the global greenhouse effect from
becoming a disastrous reality, we
have to go to the source -— and make
sure our development lending stops
financing environmentally ruinous
projects. I worked last fall to incorpo—
rate these environmental concerns in
our foreign operations budget.

The specter of the greenhouse ef-
fect will not be laid fully to rest until
these concerns become an integral
part of America’s foreign assistance
policy. ROBERT W. KASTEN JR.

The Burning of Rondonia

A calamitous cycle of destruction is unfolding
in Rondonia, the heavily forested Amazon province
in western Brazil. The tragedy is a lesson to Brazil
and to the international agencies that finance its
projects that heedless development can wreak
havoc with the global environment, not just Brazil’s.

DCattle ranchers and thousands of landless
settlers recently brought in by the Government are
torching the tropical forest to clear the land.

DThe fires are so extensive that they add ap-
preciably to the global pollution that now may be
warming the earth’s climate.

DThe richly diverse forest, ancient home to a
fifth of the world’s plant and animal species, is
being destroyed irreversibly, and its Amerindian in-
habitants are dying from imported diseases.

1:] Stripped of the trees that recycle forest nutri-
ents, the soil yields only a few years’ crops before
the settlers move on, to destroy more forest.

A new picture of the damage has emerged from
a NASA satellite sensitive to heat sources. Scien-
tists at Brazil’s Space Research Center, Marlise
Simons has reported in The Times, have counted
170,000 fires last year in the western Amazon.

The fires contribute twice over to the green—
house effect, the feared warming of the world’s cli-
mate that may already have begun in the recent
string of hot summers. They contribute fully one-
tenth of the global production of carbon dioxide, the
principal greenhouse gas. And once the forest is
burned, it can no longer absorb carbon dioxide from
the air and turn it back into vegetation.

Despite the richness and diversity of tropical
forests, their soil is mostly poor. Shielded from the
recurrent ice ages that repeatedly extinguished life
in temperate zones, the animals and plants of the
tropics have had millions of years in which to de-
velop new species and complex interdependencies.
The living systems now being destroyed in Brazil
are the flower of some 50 million years of evolution.

Cattle ranchers, responsible for 80 percent of
the destruction, receive sizable tax breaks. Without
such subsidies, the cattle ranches are “inherently
uneconomic,” writes Robert Repetto of the World
Resources Institute. Besides the ranchers, half a
million settlers have invaded the Rondonian forest

along the new Cuiabé-Pérto Velho road, paved with
a $250 million World Bank loan. The Bank’s re-
q'Uests for protection of the forests and their tribes
were ignored. Since the road was paved, the area of

destroyed forest has tripled. Rondonia, endowed
with one of the world’s richest ecosystems, is al-
ready 17 percent deforested.

The tragedy is that the forest could be pre-
served even as its resources are tapped. Permanent
crops like coffee bushes do less damage than annual
cropping or cattle. The valuable hardwood trees
could be harvested instead of burned. Migrant set-
tlers would hunger less for forest land if Brazil.
redistributed the 43 percent of its arable land now
owned by just 1 percent of its population.

The World Bank has learned from the disaster
of the Rondonia road, but it and other lending agen-
cies need to ensure that Brazil shares the lesson.

An imaginative scheme of debt-for—nature
swaps has been devised by Thomas Lovejoy of the
World Wildlife Fund: the fund raises money to buy
up the dollar—denominated debt of countries like Bo-
livia, Ecuador and Costa Rica, which it exchanges
for local currencies to ‘be used in establishing na-
ture preserves.

By such means, the headlong devastation of
Rondonia can perhaps be halted before it becomes a
wasteland that serves only to fuel the global green
house effect. The destruction of the Amazon forest
IS a crime from which no one benefits.

Thousands of Amazon Acres Burning
Clearing Practices Threaten Western Hemisphere ’8 Air Quality

 

By Mac Margolis

Special to The Washington Post

ALTA FLORESTA, Brazil—In
the Brazilian Amazon, the vast for-
est land that takes its name from
the continent’s largest river, there
are now three distinct seasons. Two
of them, the rainy and the dry sea-
sons, are nature’s doing, ancient as
the tropical rain forest itself. The
third is new and the handiwork of
the earth’s most destructive tenant,
man.

Brazilians call this season the
queimadas, the burnings, a volatile
interregnum between the dry and
wet seasons, when small farmers
and armies of peons employed by
land barons set fires to clear the
land of scrub and jungle.

They are a legacy of slash.and-
burn agriculture, a method of clear-
ing land practiced by many South
American Indians. Yet as the Bra-
zilian government has pursued its
own manifest destiny and waves Of
white settlers have pushed into the
jungle to the north, the scale of
burnings has gotten out of hand.

Tens of thousands of acres of
Brazil's jungle forests and scrub
lands are being laid waste by fires,
set by small landholders, cattle
ranchers and plantation owners who
do not have the money, or are in too
much of a hurry, to cut down the
wood, according to Brazilian scien-
tists and government officials.

The fires, intended to clear land
for planting and pastures, will de-
stroy 80,000 square miles of forest
this year, an area larger than Den-
mark, Belgium, Austria and Swit-
zerland combined. The smoke
plumes, rising up to three miles.
.Iill foul the atmosphere with mil-
lions of tons of particulate matter
and carbon dioxide, researchers at
the. Sao Paulo-based Institute tor
Space Research estimate.

 

Scientists say the nearly 5,000
daily fires set between July and ()c-
tober not only ravage forests of the
Amazon basin but contribute signif-
icantly to air pollution in the West-
ern Hemisphere.

But it does not take a science de-
gree to appreciate the devastation
wrought by the burnings. The dam-
age was all too evident on a recent
trip to this frontier town in Mato
Grosso State, on the Bolivian bor-
der. Alta Floresta is Portuguese for
“high forest," which, thanks to the
autumn fires and buzz saws of about
600 lumber mills, is vanishing at an
alarming rate.

A twin-engine Fokker aircraft
droned lazy circles through a sky
choked with acrid smoke while the
pilot strained to find a runway a
mere 20 stories below. After 30
minutes of searching in vain, the
pilot, in what has become a daily
ritual, was forced to land at an al-
ternative airstrip and wait for hours
until the “dry clouds” dissipated.

Along vast stretches of major
roads, a gantlet of ﬂames licked at
the trees and brush. Farther on,
entire stands have become denuded
fields, strewn with smoldering
stumps and ashen boughs. Embers
and soot ﬂoated eerily to earth, like
black snow or the detritus of some
invisible factory smoke-stack.

The seasonal burnings have in-
creased as small landholders and
big ranchers have advanced into
Brazil’s northern frontier. Vast
swaths of forest have been cleared
to make way for soybean planta-
tions, to feed local saw mills and for
cattle pastures. Many developers
have enjoyed tax breaks and gov-
ernment incentives to topple the
forests.

But only in the last two years
have scientists been able to docu-
ment the full impact of the autumn

blazes. A recently released report
by the Institute for Space Research,
drawing on weather satellite images
gathered during an 80-day period
last year, “conservatively esti-
mated” that 80,000 square miles of

forest, or 4 percent of the entire,
Amazon region, was burned be-

tween July and October of 1987.
Some states, where pioneer set-
tlement and road building have
been intense, lost enormous por-
tions of their forests in just a few
months. Para State lost 18.7 per-
cent and Rondonia 8.9 percent, for
example. The burning released 620

 

 

million tons of carbon gas and par-
ticulate matter into the atmos-
phere.

“This phenomenon . . . will cer-
tainly be linked in the near future to
atmospheric alterations of our plan-
et, and quite probably to the prob-
lem of the [depletion of] the Ant-
arctic Ozone, where the winds
transport the emissions from the
burnings,” the report states.

The report concludes, “The
dense smoke produced by the Am-
azonian burnings, at the height of
the season, spread over millions of
square kilometers, bringing health
problems to the population, shut-
ting down airports, hampering air
traffic, causing various accidents on
riverways and on roads, and pollut-
ing the earth’s atmosphere in gen-
eral."

Dr. Alberto Setzer, a space in-
stitute researcher who holds a doc-

torate in environmental engineering
from Purdue University, said the
seasonal fires could contribute to
the so-called “greenhouse effect,”
superheating the earth’s atmos-
phere, which could alter world
weather patterns and, in the ex-
treme, melt the polar ice caps,
causing oceans to rise drastically.

The space research agency is
monitoring this year’s Amazon
burning closely and alerting the au-
thorities, but the government has
been slow to react. “We have had
only a small impact on policy,” la-
mented Setzer.

The burnings and the impotence
of authorities to contain them have
also sparked political protest in Bra-
zil and touched off a crossfire of
criticism among government agen-
cies.

Much of the blame has fallen to
the Brazilian Institute for Forestry
Development, frequently accused of
being ineffectual and indifferent be-
fore the destruction of the rain for-
est. The forestry institute’s presi-

dent, Antonio Jose Guimaraes, ad- '

mitted on a nationwide television
show that the agency is all but pow-
erless to contain the fires. He noted
the agency is chronically under-
funded and understaffed, with only
600 inspectors, of whom only 170
are assigned to the 2 million square
miles of Amazonia. The agency's
budget, $11 million for this year,
represents only 6 percent of the
Ministry of Agriculture’s total rev-
enues.

Privately, forestry officials admit
that low penalties and lax inspection
have created an anything-goes cli-
mate in the hinterlands, where en-
vironmental laws are routinely ig-
nored. Although the forestry agen-
cy requires that all lumber compa-
nies maintain a reserve of standing
forest, one high-level agency official
returning from an inspection tour in
southern Brazil said, “90 percent of
the lumberers didn’t have any re-
serve at all. They cut everything
down.”

Asked about the extent of the
burnings in Mato Grosso State, the
secretary for environment, Jose
Rodrigues Goncalves, stood up and
pointed out his office window. Near-
by, next to the secretariat’s parking
lot, an acre of brush was burning.
Smoke seeped through the air con-
ditioning and into Goncalves’s of-

fice, and ash settled on the coffee .

table.

Delegates of the forestry insti-
tute and federal police agents held
separate meetings last week to
draw up new regulations and dis-
cuss stiffer penalties for ranchers
who set illegal fires. But few are
convinced that new rules will offer
much protection to the forest.

Does greenhouse
make sea bloom?

QLRobert C. Cowen

HIS summer’s toxic algae bloom in the

North Sea that cost ﬁshermen several

hundred million dollars in lost catches
also gave a new perspective on climatic
warmmg.

Marine biologist Victor Smetacek of the Al-
fred Wegener Institute for Polar and Maritime
Research in Bremerhaven, West Germany, says
the air’s rising enrichment with carbon dioxide
(C02) may be partly responsible for the abnor-
mally lush algae growth.

CO? - the most important of the climate-
warmmg gases - is a plant nutrient. Algae, like
all green plants, convert it into carbohydrates
Via photosynthesis. Thus air enriched in C02,
plus possible temperature changes related to

climatic warming, could encourage such algae ‘

blooming.

This, of course, is speculation. But it does
point up the fact that a rise of one to several
degrees in our planet’s average surface tem-
perature is not the most important aspect of the

 

 

 

greenhouse warming. The main impact is likely
to appear in a variety of subtle ways that have
major biological eﬁects.

A team of NASA and Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology climate modelers empha-
sizes this in connec-
tion with a new global
lwsarming study it pub- RESEARCH

NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies,
the team has run new computer simulations of
possible climatic effects of that warming over
the next 70 years. These suggest, among other
changes, that the probability of a hot summer is
likely to rise above 50 percent in the 19908,
compared with about 33 percent in the past.

Commenting on such changes over such a
short time span, the scientists say, “We empha-
$128 that it is the possibility of rapid climate
change which is of most concern for the bio-
sphere; there may not be sufﬁcient time for
many biosystems to adapt to the rapid changes
forecast. . . .”

This is a warning we should heed. Climate
simulations like this are not deﬁnitive. The
computations can’t take account of all relevant
factors. Yet they do provide useful insight.

Project Cohmap (Cooperative Holocene
Mapping Project) at the University of Wis-
consin’s Center for Climatic Research is testing
the ability of computer modeling to mimic past
climate changes. In a major study covering the
past 18,000 years published in the Aug. 26
issue of Science, the Cohmap team concludes
that “climate models have fair skill in simulat-
ing the broad geographic patterns of atmos-
pheric circulation, temperature, and moisture.”

So, while simulations such as those run by
Hansen and his colleagues may not be perfect,
they do have credibility. They are good enough
to put us on notice that, Whatever speciﬁc
climatic changes lie ahead, these will come fast
enough to cause severe strain to the biosphere.

We have scarcely begun to suspect the many
and often subtle ways in which this strain will
appear. Lost crops and shifts of agricultural
belts are only the most obvious of the possibili-
ties.

In spite of the step-up in climatic research
now under way, little work is being done on the
possible ecological effects of climate change.
Such work is badly needed.

Algae on the beach

algae rotting along Italy’s eastern coast. A gela-

that drove away tourists.

Scientists of the University of Bologna’s

that the algae have proliferated because of the
unusually hot, calm weather in the
Mediterranean this summer, not because of
pollution. However, local governments are seek-
1ng_money to clean up the River Po, which
cames waste and sewage to the Adriatric from
the industrial area around Milan. They fear that
tourists will desert polluted resorts.

next three years to clean up the Po. Italy has
already earmarked £17 million for this. [:1

 

 

 

 

 




Brazil Accuses Scholar
Of Aiding Indian Protest

 

RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 13 — The
Brazilian federal police have brought
charges against an American anthro-
pologist who accompanied two Amazon
Indian leaders on a visit to Washington
earlier this year.

Brazilian authorities have appar-
ently been angered because the Kaiapo
Indians were received by officials of
the World Bank, the State Department
and Treasury Department as well as
Congressional staff members. The In-
dians complained of official mistreat-
ment and the destruction of their jun—
gle environment.

A major focus of their complaints
was a new hydroelectric dam complex
planned along the Xingu River in cen-
tral Brazil, which is scheduled to flood

Special to The New York Times

The decision to press charges
against Darrell Posey, a 41-year-old
anthropologist and biologist from Ken-
tucky, seemed aimed at sending a
warning about the limits of official
tolerance of protests abroad. Repre-
sentatives of Brazil’s estimated 220,000
Indians have become increasingly
vocal at home, but few have traveled
abroad.

Dr. Posey, who translated for the two
Kaiapo, has been charged with violat—
ing a law that forbids foreigners to in-
terfere in Brazilian internal affairs. A
spokesman of the federal police in
Brasilia said that if found guilty, Dr.
Posey “will be expelled from the coun-
try.”

ington,” Dr. Posey said. “The real
issue here is the right of the Indians to
speak for themselves about whatever,
and wherever, they want.”

José Carlos Castro, Dr. Posey’s law-
yer, has argued that his client cannot
be punished for any criticism he or
others made in the United States unless
he violated American law.

Dr. Posey has studied the Kaiapo, a
group of ancient warrior tribes, for the
last 11 years and is coordinator of the
department of ethnobiology at the Emi-
lio Goeldi Museum in the Amazonian
city of Belem.

He and the Kaiapo traveled to Miami
in late January to attend a conference
on tropical rain forests at Florida In-
ternational University, which paid all
expenses. The federal police here pro-
vided the Kaiapo with passports, and
the regional director of the National In-
dian Foundation authorized their
travel to Miami.

Members of the National Wildlife
Federation and the Environmental De-
fense Fund, two American conserva-
tion groups, said they provided further
funds at the Miami conference and set
up a schedule for the Indians to visit of-
ficials in Washington.

At the heart of the Brazilian Govern-

ment’s action appears to be official
concern over a proposed $500 million
loan by the World Bank to Brazil’s
state-owned power company, Electro-
bras. Although the loan is not ear-
marked for a specific project, this com-
panv will build the Xingu dams.

As part of the evidence in the case,

Mr. Castro said, the police are using
Brazilian newspaper reports about the
Kaiapo visit to Washington last Febru-
ary. The reports speculated that the In-
dians’ testimony could adversely affect
approval of the $500 million loan. Ne-
gotiations began almost two years ago,
but the loan approval has been post-
poned several times and it was re-
cently rescheduled for a vote in Octo-
ber. Some Brazilian officials are said to
believe that the delay is related to the
Kaiapo complaints.
A spokesman for the World Bank
denied any such link. “Sure there is a
lot of concern at the bank about the
Xingu project,” the spokesman said.
"we cannot lend money to the Brazil
power sector and close our eyes to the
guidelines for the environment and the

But he said the loan had been held up

 

because the bank was looking into what

 

he described as the power company’s
huge debt, its poor management and
wasteful use of resources.

Sensitivity to Foreign Criticism

The case against Dr. Posey has none-
theless highlighted growing official
sensitivity about foreign pressure as
the country is developing the immense
resources of the Amazon. Officials fre-
quently react with irritation when for-
eign governments, environmental
groups and international loan agencres
express concern about Indian rights
and safeguarding a region that holds
the world’s largest tropical forest and
river network.

The reception given to the Indians in

‘ Washington attracted attention at the

highest levels of the Government. The
national security council and the na-
tional intelligence agency have exam-
ined details and motives behind the
Washington visit, while the order to
press charges against Dr. Posey has
reportedly come from high officnals of
the Ministry of Justice in Brasilia.

No charges have been brought
against Kube-i and Paiakan, the two
Kaiapo. In Brazil, Indians are wards of
the state and are treated as minors be-
fore the law.

RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil —— Thou-
sands of fortune-seeking gold panners
are being forced by their own govern-
ment to leave much of Brazil’s Amazon
jungle. according to leaders of the dig-
gers’ union.

The prospectors’ complaints were
aired at a news conference on Tuesday
when President Jose Sarney’s govern-
ment was accused of kicking freelance
gold panners out of huge tracts of land
set aside for parks, Indian reservations
and large-scale mining companies. And
the gold panners, known as ‘garimpei-
ros,” are angry.

“The government is acting against us
because we don’t depend on it We live
alone in the forest, relying on no one but
ourselves," said Jose Altino Machado,
president of the Garimpeiros Labor
Union;

His union claims to represent 400,000
scruffy gold panners scattered across
the vast. jungle-clad Amazon basin in
ntrthern Brazil.

housands of Brazilian men have
poured into the Amazon region since
1980 in search of their fortunes, creating
one of the biggest gold rushes in history.

Evoking images of the California
goidoseekers of the 18405, they come
armed with picks, shovels, pans and of-
ten rifles to protect their claims from
rival garimpeiros.

The garimpeiros have helped make
Brazil the world’s sixth largest gold pro-
ducor, accounting for over three-quar-
ters of the country’s production, gold
analysts say.

But prospectors say they have gotten
small thanks for their tireless work un-
der dangerous conditions.

They said President Sarney is now
under pressure from an unholy alliance
of environmentalists and powerful min-
ing companies to bar gold panners from
huge tracts of Amazon land.

“Our biggest enemy is the (the gov-
ernment’s) Environmental Secretariat.

 

‘Our biggest enemy is the (the government’s)
Environmental Secretariat. Every time we ﬁnd gold,
they say that trees and monkeys are more valuable than
gold and tell us we have to leave.’ '

i — Jose Altino Machado, President, Garimpeiros Labor Union

 

Every time we find gold, they say that
trees and monkeys are more valuable
than gold and tell us we have to leave,”
said Mr. Machado.

He said that police have chased gar-
impeiros out of sprawling national parks
and biological reserves, areas that could
yield tons of gold and help pay off Bra-
zil’s $121 billion foreign debt.

Since 1979, Brazil has set up nine
such parks and reserves across the Am-
azon, including the Jan National Park,
which is the size of Greece, in the heart
of the region in Amazonas state.

Indian reservations also impinge on

lands that could yield millions of dollars
worth of gold, said Mr. Machado.

“The government sees we‘re finding
gold in (Indian areas). But instead of
encouraging us to dig it up, it says: ‘You
can’t stay here,’ ” said Antonio Feijao, a
geologist and union leader.

“So the garimpeiros go across the
border to Venezuela and find gold for
Venezuela. . . and Brazil loses,” he said.

President Sarney’s government also
has set aside enormous tracts of Ama-
zon land for gold prospecting by mining
companies, often with multinational
connections, the union leaders said.

Violence 1n the Brazilian jungle— a global concern

 

By Alan B. Durning

 

N June 18, Ivair Higino de
Almeida, a peasant farmer living
near the remote Amazonian town
of Xapuri, Brazil, rose early to milk his
cow. Several hours later his family found
him lying dead on a dusty road en route to
his pasture. He had been shot eight times.

This victim of the violence endemic to
the Brazilian back country had appar-
ently committed the crime of political in-
discretion: running for town council on
the wrong side of the region’s most vola-
tile issue — forest clearing. He was a mem-
ber of the party supported by the rubber
tappers’ union, a syndicate of 30,000 men
and women who earn a living by collect-
ing natural rubber and Brazil nuts in the
disappearing rain forest. The union has
been a tenacious opponent of forest de-
struction. Mr. Higino’s murderers, on the
other hand, are believed to have been
hired guns of the ultraconservative,
ultrapowerful cattle ranchers, loggers,
and land speculators who reap quick
proﬁts from deforestation.

Lush tropical forests once blanketed
the state of Acre, where Xapuri is situ-
ated, but since the ’605 powerful eco—
nomic and political forces have thrown
fortune seekers into the jungles. With
each new invasion, the forest is pushed
back and its interior cut into an irregular
patchwork of clearings and trees.

The rich come to exploit vast spreads
of land, while the poor — mostly displaced
rural workers and tenant farmers — come
with dreams of a better life on their own
plot of land. Rich and poor alike clear the
forest to establish their claim, and the
national government consistently pro-
motes the process through tax incentives
and road projects.

The ultimate trag-
edy of the deforesta-
tion is that, in the
long run, no one
beneﬁts. Rain forest
soil is extremely
fragile, sustaining
only a few years of
cultivation before it
degrades into use-
less brush. Ranchers
and farmers have no
choice but to clear
more trees, repeat-
ing the vicious circle,
and the rubber tap-
pers who have been
in the forest for dec-
ades are simply driven out — some-
times at gunpoint.

In the late ’7OS a band of
Xapuri’s rubber tappers organized
to protect their forests through im-
provised methods reminiscent of
Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Lu-
ther King. Men, women, and chil-
dren would enter the land where
the forest was falling to the chain
saw and the torch and appeal to
the hired hands with simple logic:
“The forest is the roof over our
heads, it is our life and livelihood.
Please, we are poor like you. Do
not burn our home to the ground.”

If persuasion did not sufﬁce,
they would peacefully occupy the
forest, putting their bodies in the
path of destruction. More recently
they have taken their protests into
the courthouse, the legislative
chamber, and the governor’s man-
sion. On the international level,
they have helped reshape World
Bank and Inter—American Develop-
ment Bank lending policy by show-

I L“

ranching or farming.

But one conse-

quence of their suc-

cess has been violent

reprisal from land-

owners. In 1981 the

president of the ru-

ral labor union, a

rubber tapper

named Rio Sopiero

de Souza, was assas-

sinated, and this

May two teen-age

rubber tappers were shot repeat-

edly by unidentiﬁed gurunen while

they slept. They were among 300

people sitting in at government of-

ﬁces to protest illegal forest clear-
ing by a local cattle rancher.

In none of these cases have the
police brought charges. Before
Higino was murdered, the rubber
tappers had received death threats
from a landlord with claims to a
contested area. Residents call the
local criminal-justice system a
crime, contending that the police
are bought off by the landlords.

Violent repression of trade
unions is a violation of fundamen-
tal human rights wherever it oc-
curs, and deserves international
attention; yet the context of
Higino’s murder gives his case a
global dimension. The forests at
stake are a critical link in the
earth’s life-support system.

The Amazonian rain forests,
which once blanketed the plain

of the Andes to the Atlantic Ocean, can be
thought of as the lungs of the earth. They
regulate the climate of South America
and slow greenhouse warming by absorb-
ing carbon dioxide that would otherwise
trap the sun’s heat. The earth’s tempera-
tures are partly determined by the num-
ber of trees in Xapuri. And as the weather
goes, so go our farms, food prices, and
economy.

Moreover, with more than a million
species, the Amazon Basin holds the larg—
est concentration of living things on
earth. The diversity of ﬂora and fauna in
a few square miles of rain forest exceeds
that of the entire United States.

Yet as Brazil’s economy has sunk ever
deeper under the weight of international
debt, rain forest destruction has acceler-
ated. In the time it takes to read this
article, an area the size of several football
ﬁelds will have been stripped of forest
cover. The world may already be losing
tens of species each day, most of them
unknown, as habitat is destroyed. What
role they play in maintaining the health
of ecosystems we do not know — nor what
value they might have to science, medi-
cine, and agriculture.

Across the Amazon Basin, thousands
of unorganized rubber tappers are watch-
ing Xapuri, wondering whether they too
could join hands to protect their forests.
They are watching to see if Ivair Higino’s
murderers are brought to trial.

Only a full investigation and criminal
prosecution can show that law and not
ﬁrepower shall rule in the rain forest.
And until justice is done, neither basic
human rights, nor the thousands of en-
dangered species, nor the health of the
global climate can be protected.

Such companies wreck thousands of

which all life has been killed by mercu-

panics.

forest down and pollute rivers with mer~

' Mr. Feijao added: “The real garim-

never been to the Amazon or has never

Brazil Accuses Scholar
Of Aiding Indian Protest

 

RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug. 13 — The
Brazilian federal police have brought
charges against an American anthro-
pologist who accompanied two Amazon
Indian leaders on a visit to Washington
earlier this year.

Brazilian authorities have appar-
ently been angered because the Kaiapo
Indians were received by officials of
the World Bank, the State Department
and Treasury Department as well as
Congressional staff members. The In-
dians complained of official mistreat-
ment and the destruction of their jun-
gle environment.

A major focus of their complaints
was a new hydroelectric dam complex
planned along the Xingu River in cen-
tral Brazil, which is scheduled to flood

Special to The New York Times

The decision to press charges
against Darrell Posey, a 41-year-old
anthropologist and biologist from Ken-
tucky, seemed aimed at sending a
warning about the limits of official
tolerance of protests abroad. Repre-
sentatives of Brazil’s estimated 220,000
Indians have become increasingly
vocal at home, but few have traveled
abroad.

Dr. Posey, who translated for the two
Kaiapé, has been charged with violat-
ing a law that forbids foreigners to in-
terfere in Brazilian internal affairs. A
spokesman of the federal police in
Brasilia said that if found guilty, Dr.
Posey “will be expelled from the coun-
try.”

Denying the Indians 3 Voice

“The police want me to admit that I

ington,” Dr. Posey said. “The real
issue here is the right of the Indians to
speak for themselves about whatever,
and wherever, they want.”

José Carlos Castro, Dr. Posey’s law-
yer, has argued that his client cannot
be punished for any criticism he or
others made in the United States unless
he violated American law.

Dr. Posey has studied the Kaiapo, a
group of ancient warrior tribes, for the
last 11 years and is coordinator of the
department of ethnobiology at the Emi-
lio Goeldi Museum in the Amazonian
city of Belém.

He and the Kaiapo traveled to Miami
in late January to attend a conference
on tropical rain forests at Florida In-
ternational University, which paid all
expenses. The federal police here pro-
vided the Kaiapo with passports, and
the regional director of the National In-
dian Foundation authorized their
travel to Miami.

Members of the National Wildlife
Federation and the Environmental De-
fense Fund, two American conserva-
tion groups, said they provided further
funds at the Miami conference and set
up a schedule for the Indians to visit of-
ficials in Washington.

At the heart of the Brazilian Govern-

THEJLEW VomitmgleEs AUGQ§T 14, 1988_

ment’s action appears to be official
concern over a proposed $500 million
loan by the World Bank to Brazil’s
state-owned power company, Electro-
bras. Although the loan is not ear-
marked for a specific project, this com-
panv will build the Xingu dams.

As part of the evidence in the case,
Mr. Castro said, the police are using
Brazilian newspaper reports about the
Kaiapo visit to Washington last Febru-
ary. The reports speculated that the In-
dians’ testimony could adversely affect
approval of the $500 million loan. Ne-
gotiations began almost two years ago,
but the loan approval has been post-
poned several times and it was re-

ber. Some Brazilian officials are said to
believe that the delay is related to the
Kaiapo complaints.

A spokesman for the World Bank
denied any such link. “Sure there is a
lot of concern at the bank about the
Xingu project,” the spokesman said.
“We cannot lend money to the Brazil
power sector and close our eyes to the
guidelines for the environment and the
Amerindians.”

But he said the loan had been held up

 

because the bank was looking into what

cently rescheduled for a vote in Octo— .

 

he described as the power company’s
huge debt, its poor management and
wasteful use of resources.

Sensitivity to Foreign Critiéis‘m

The case against Dr. Posey has none-
theless highlighted growing official

L .8. Areas May
Be lst Victims of
Warming Earth

By THOMAS H. MAUGH II,
Times Science Writer

The Midwest farm belt. and the
southeastern United States will be
among the first regions of the
Earth to feel the effects of “green~
house" warming caused by the
release of r-art.-on dioxide and other
gases into the atmosphere, accord-
ing to predictions of a new comput-
er model of the atmosphere devel-
oped at the NASA-Goddard
Institute for Space Studies in New
York City. '

The model allows scientists, for
the first time, to predict the effects
of greenhouse warming over the
next 10 to 20 years rather than 50 to
70 years in the future, as is'the case
with previous models, according to
atmospheric physicist Anthony'Del
Genio of Goddard.

California Gets a Reprieve

By identifying which regions will
be first to warm up, the model may
enable scientists to observe the
first stages of the greenhouse effect
and give them a better idea of how
to deal with it. Other regions of
early warming predicted by the
model include the East Indies, the
Bay of Bengal in India, the Mongo-
lian-Manchurian region of Asia and
both polar regions.

The model also predicts that
California and the Pacific Coast will
be among the last regions to be
affected by greenhouse warming,
lagging behind the rest of the
country by perhaps 25 years.

Surprisingly, the model also pre—
dicts that even in the highly un-
likely event that the release of
carbon dioxide and other so-called
greenhouse gases were to be halted
immediatel y, the Earth would con-
tinue to grow warmer for at least 13
years. “It takes the Earth a while to
respond to the gases that are

already there,” Del Genio said.

The computer model was devel—
oped by a team led by Climatologist
James E. Hansen and is described
in the current Journal of Geophysi-
cal Research —Atmospheres.

‘ Hansen made national headlines
in June when he told a Senate
committee that the heat and
drought afflicting the Midwest rep-
resented the first stages of the
greenhouse effect. That conclusion
Was based on both the computer
model and the observation that
four of the hottest years on record
have occurred during the 19803.

Many other researchers argue
that the drought was caused by
normal climatic variability rather
than by the greenhouse effect. But
few would question the conclusion
that greenhouse warming is immi-
nent

The climatological effects of car--
bon dioXide and similar gases have
been recognized since the late
18005. Such gases allow the sun’s
light to reach the Earth's surface
and warm it, but absorb heat that
would otherwise be radiated into
space—thus trapping heat. '

The amount of carbon dioxide in
the Earth’s atmosphere has grown
from about 270 parts per million in
the mid—18005 to about 350 parts
per million now. A 1983 National
Academy of Sciences report pre—
dicted that the level could reach
600 parts per million within 50 to
100 years if the use of fossil fuels
continued to grow at then-current
rates.

Climatologists estimate that the
Earth’s surface temperature has
already increased between 0.5 and
1.25 degrees Fahrenheit since 1850.
Previous projections have estimat-
ed a warming of as much as 9
degrees in the next 100 years.

Such warming could cause a
marked change in weather pat-
terns, including a northward shift
of precipitation. It could also cause
a melting of the polar icecaps,

accompanied by an increase in the .

oceans' level and coastal. flooding.

Hansen and his colleagues used
their model to study three different
scenarios: continued rapid growth
in the release of greenhouse gases;
curtailed growth of release rates
and no increase in release rates.

In the first case, they calculated
that the Earth’s temperature would
rise by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit in
the next 20 years. If growth in
release rates were curtailed, 25
years would be required for a
similar temperature increase.

And even with no increase in
growth rates, the average global
temperature would probably climb
by 0 8 degrees within the next 15
years, they said. That increase
would bring the Earth’s tempera-
ture to the peaks reached during
the Altithermal and Eemian peri-
ods 6,000 and 120,000 years ago.

The model identified regions of
early warming by characterizing
interactions between the oceans.
which warm very slowly, and land.
which warms much more rapidly.
In the United States, for example,

some Controls on the release of greenhouse gases, and scenario C

average temperatures during extremely warm periods about 6,000 and

these effects combine to produce
high—pressure regions off the At-
lantic and Pacific coasts.

Because winds flow clockwise
around a high-pressure region,

they would bring warm air from'

equatorial regions into the South-

east and Midwest. Similar winds.

around the Pacific high would
bring cool. Arctic air to California.
In each of the three scenarios,
the researchers wrote, greenhouse
warming “should. be clearly identi-
fiable in the 1990s.” And for the
first two cases, the predicted
warming rate of about 0.9 degrees
per decade is a much faster change
than any in the historical record,
they said. “There may not be

sufficient time for many biosys—
tems to adapt to the rapid changes -
forecast. . . ,”they wrote.

The researchers .also warned
that the frequency of extreme
weather events could be more
dangerous to the biosphere than
the increase in average tempera—
ture. They note, for example, that
Omaha, Neb., has experienced a
run of at least five days with
temperatures above 95 degrees 0n-
ly three times per decade, on
average. The model predicts that
the number will increase to five
times per decade in the 19908 and
seven times per decade by 2020.

Such runs of high temperature
are very damaging to both crops
and humans, Hansen warned.

 

 




New Scientist 8 September 1988

 

 

 

American politicians warm to greenhouse effect

ROPHESIES of global warming are
winning over politicians in the US
and creating a movement to curb the

country’s craving for fossil fuel. The most
outspoken scientist studying the green-
house effect has issued his strongest
warning yet, in the Journal of Geophysical
Research.

James Hansen, of NASA’s Goddard
Institute for Space Studies in New York,
said that within a few decades, temperature
changes “will become large enough to have
major effects on the quality of life for
mankind in many regions”.

Hansen leapt ahead of the scientiﬁc
mainstream three months ago by stating
that the drought that affected the US this
summer was probably due to the green-
house effect (New Scientist, 30 June, p 35).
His claims, derived from his then
unpublished paper, put the greenhouse
effect in the headlines and swayed many
politicians. “They didn’t realise that this
issue is going to be on their plates” during
the coming elections, says Michael
Oppenheimer, a physicist with the Envi-
ronmental Defense Fund in New York.

George Bush, the Republican presiden-
tial candidate, last week declared himself
“an environmentalist” at a speech in Mich-
igan. He remarked on how hot the summer

 

Christopher Joyce, Washington DC

had been, promised to convene an inter-
national conference on the environment
and said it was time to act to halt acid rain.

Cutting consumption of fossil fuels that
emit carbon dioxide is the main aim of the
greenhouse movement. Its champion in
Congress is Senator Timothy Wirth of
Colorado. Wirth introduced legislation in
July to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by
20 per cent by 2000 and to rejuvenate
research on alternative forms of energy.

Already, the US generates more than
one-ﬁfth of the world’s emissions. About
half the globe’s warming because of human
activities is due to carbon dioxide. Other
trace gases also contribute to warming:
methane accounts for 20 per cent, chloro-
ﬂuorocarbons another 15 per cent and
nitrous oxide 10 per cent. Since the mid-
19th century, global concentrations of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have
increased by 25 per cent.

The US government’s programme of
research into alternative forms of energy
has been slowly declining during Ronald
Reagan’s administration. The Department
of Energy’s budget for conservation has
dropped by more than half, to $156 million
between 1980 and 1988.

 

Wirth’s bill would infuse $450 million
into the development of renewable sources
of energy during the first two years of the
19905. He also wants to convene an inter-
national conference on how to cut harmful
emissions.

Several coalitions have either taken up
the greenhouse banner or have been
created to force it onto the electoral agenda
this year. These include the Alliance. to
Save Energy, the Energy Conservatlon
Coalition, the Fund for Renewable Energy
and the Environment, and the American
Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.
Wirth has presented the Democratic pre51-
dential candidate, Michael Dukakis, with
scientific evidence of global warming.

Concern over the threat from carbon
dioxide has rekindled some support for
nuclear energy and with it some of the argu-
ments last heard in the 19705. For example,
should nuclear reactors replace coal—ﬁred
power stations? A letter in Science on
26 August, from experts at the Rocky
Mountain Institute in Colorado, says no.
Bill Keepin and Gregory Kats write that a
dollar invested in making electrical appli-
ances more efﬁcient displaces 50 kilowatt
hours of coal-fired electricity. A dollar put
into a nuclear plant will displace a mere
7-4 kilowatt hours of coal power. [3

states of the US will warm
more slowly than the average
during the next decade or so.

Among the many effects of a
rise in temperatures of around
0-5 °C per decade is a shift in
temperature and vegetation
belts towards the poles of
perhaps 50 to 75 kilometres
per decade. That is about 10
times as fast as most plants and
trees have been observed to
migrate in the geological
record.

Hansen has assumed some
absorption of heat by oceans
and some vertical mixing of
heated surface waters with
deeper ocean currents. He

 

 

Hansen described how he has “0'4 I

run his model using three
scenarios for possible future
emissions: These scenarios,
shown on the graph, are:

A: Trace gas emissions continue to grow
at current rates of about 1-5 per cent
annually, producing an escalating
“forcing effect” for global warning;

B: The grth rate slows so that the
forcing effect remains constant;

C: Drastic cuts in emissions over the next
10 years cause the forcing effect to cease
growing by 2000.

Hansen predicts that, whatever we do
now, over the next few decades, mean
temperatures will match or exceed the
highest levels during the past few inter-
glacial periods. The world will probably
be on average 0.5 °C warmer 15 years
from now and 1°C warmer within 25
years, even if emissions of carbon dioxide

and other trace gases are cut back.

Weather has its own natural variability,
and an unusually warm summer is not
necessarily cause for alarm. But by the
19905, the rise in mean temperatures will
exceed the natural range.

Hansen describes the chances of an
abnormally hot summer thus: until now,
hot summers happen two years in every
six. According to his calculations, by the
19905 they will occur in the US three or
four times every six years.

The first places to show significant
warming, says Hansen, will be tropical
oceans, China and the interior areas in
Asia, and ocean areas near Antarctica and
the North Pole. In the US, the cast will
warm up somewhat more than the

could inﬂuence the degree of
warming, especially as the

volcanic eruptions; Changes in the
amount and distribution of clouds, which

reduce warming; and variations in solar
radiation.

The model’s results could be askew by
as much as 50 per cent, says Hansen.
“Obviously that’s not as good as you’d
like. But if the effects do show up in the
19905, that will help us check our model,”
he says.

Even half the predicted temperature
change would alter climate. “My point
is that although there are still large
uncertainties, we should do things to
reduce greenhouse effects,” says
Hansen. [:1

 

 

 

 




THE NEW YORK TIMES THE ENVIRONMENT 'rszsnAi:

His Bold Statement
Transforms the Debate
On Greenhouse Effect

 

By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

 

Sitting in his office near the Colum-
bia University campus, seven floors
above the internal combustion of fos-
sil fuel along Broadway, James E.
Hansen held a large pair of what he
called loaded dice. He was making a
point last week about the probabil-
ities of drastic climate change as a
result of the greenhouse effect.

In testimony before a Senate sub-
committee in June, Dr. Hansen, an at-
mospheric physicist and director of
the Goddard Institute for Space Stud-
ies, sounded the alarm with such au-
thority and force that the issue of an
overheating world has suddenly
moved to the forefront of public con-
cern.

What had been theory about future
consequences of human activity af-
fecting the atmosphere now seemed
to be coming true, he said, and not
only elaborate data of temperature
trends but also this summer’s wither-
ing drought and heat wave challenged
most lingering doubts.

Reputation at Risk

With his decision to come right out
and say the greenhouse effect was
here, Dr. Hansen knew he was risking
his reputation as a cautious and care-
ful scientist. But in an interview he
said he had no reason to soften his as-
sessment. He had made the card-
board dice to illustrate the trend in
climate change as projected in
mathematical models developed
from the observations of increasing
carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluo-
rocarbons and other “greenhouse"
gases in the atmosphere.

Like glass in a greenhouse, these
gases are transparent to incoming
sunlight, but they absorb heat radi-
ated from the ground and prevent it
from escaping into space.

He held up one die representing the
climate for the period 1950-1980. Two
sides were white for an average sum-
mer, and two other sides were blue
for colder-than-average summers.

The other two sides were red for hot-
ter-than-average summers. Thus, on
a roll of the die for that period, there
were two chances in six of having a
hot summer at any given location in
the country.

Then Dr. Hansen picked up the die
for the 1990's and explained:

“If our climate model calculations
are approximately correct, the green-
house warming in the 1990’s will be
sufficient to shift the probabilities
such that the chance of a hot summer
in most of the country will be in the
range of 55 to 80 percent. Four sides
of the die are red. I believe it is obvi-
ous that the man in the street will no-
tice that by then the dice are loaded.
There will be more hot summers than
normal, and the hottest ones will be
hotter than they used to be."

Support in Congress

Dr. Hansen’s message, a mix of
data-based analysis and plain-spoken
conviction, has had a stunning impact
on political thinking, say experts on
the environment and public policy.
Bipartisan support is growing in Con
gress in increase financing for ch-
mate research and to t‘tllib‘ldt‘l‘ legis-
lation aimed at controlling the intro-
duction of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.

At a 46-nation Conference on the
Changing Atmosphere in Toronto
shortly after Dr. Hansen‘s testimony,
scientists and policy makers urged
development of energy consumption
policies that would drastically reduce
carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere is increas-

“I’ve never seen an environmental

Asked what NASA’s reaction has
been to his recent bold statements,
Dr. Hansen gave a nervous smile.
‘They’re still trying to make up their
minds,” he said.

He recalled that on previous occa-
sions the Office of Management and
Budget, which reviews official state-
ments that have implications for the
budget, had forced him to delete from
the text of proposed Congressional
testimony any recommendations for
neci‘eased research spending. Last
November, rather than remove such
statements, he testified as a private

Somehow, inc hudgt'l .lti‘ice over-
looked his proposed statements for
this June. “I understand they were
really upset,” Dr. Hansen said. “Next
time, I may be back testifying as a
private citizen again.”

More Data Collection

One of his recommendations is an
expansion of global meteorological
observations, including more data
collection from the oceans. Most
weather stations are on land. But pro-
posed satellites for the 1990’s could
fill in observational gaps and answer
questions about how much heat is
being stored in the oceans and the
potential impact on climate.

 

‘What we had been
predicting is just
what’s happening.’

 

A NASA task force, headed by Dr.
Sally K. Ride, the former astronaut,
proposed last year a “mission to
planet earth” as one of the agency’s
long-term goals. The mission would
involve a coordinated scientific study
of earth resources and environment
from American and international
satellites. No official action has been
taken on any of the task force’s pro-
posals.

“NASA is an agency without a mis—
sion,” Mr. Oppenheimer said. “If it
was smart, NASA would treat Hansen
as a star. Here is a problem and a
mission that the public might reallv
get behind.”

2 Senate Bills Take Aim at 6Greenhouse ljll‘l'ect9

 

By Michael Weisskopf

Washington Pom Staff Writer

 

The first legislation aimed at re-
versing global warming was intro-
duced in the Senate yesterday, and
it set the price of avoiding the po-
tentially catastrophic results of the
“greenhouse effect” at nothing less
than fundamental changes in the
US. economy.

Two Senate bills propose differ-‘

ent, but complementary, ap-
proaches to reducing the man-made
gases that trap solar heat, raising
temperatures worldwide. Taken
together, the measures would im-
pose strict controls on everything
from automobile exhaust to home
furnaces, redesign landfills, elim-
inate chloroflourocarbons and ef-
fectively discourage use of coal as a
source of energy in favor of a “new
generation" of nuclear reactors,
solar power and natural gas.

The bills trample on so many in-
terest groups that neither of the
chief sponsors—Sen. Robert T.
Stafford (R-Vt.) and Sen. Timothy
E. Wirth (D-Colo.)—expect to
achieve anything more than com-
mittee hearings in the remaining
months of the current Congress.

Wirth noted the “conﬂicting co-
alitions out there" and said that get-
ting Congress to approve what
amounts to “restructuring our econ-
wmy" may be as difficult as Mikhail
horbachev’s perestroika in the So-
.riet Union.

Ctafford, anticipating complaints
”nu: his bill “demands too much in a
few places" and would drastically
alter American life styles, asked
fellow senators to consider “what

the world may resemble if we fail to
act.” “It will be a world hostile to
humanity and the rest of life in doz-
ens of ways; it will be a world which
I would wish on neither my children
nor grandchildren," he said.

According to scientists, green-
house gases will trap so much heat by
the middle of the next century that
world temperatures will rise as much
as eight degrees. Some areas will dry
up, and oceans will expand, leading to
flooding and beach erosion.

A NASA scientist testiﬁed in Con-
gress last month that this year’s
temperatures are “significantly
warmer” than any previous period
since measurements were first taken
about 100 years ago and that the
global warming trend is so hard to
reverse that Stafford’s ambitious

measures would cut only one or two
degrees out of the expected eight-
degree rise.

Yesterday’s bills find common
ground in urging reductions of car-
bon dioxide, the most dangerous
greenhouse gas, which is generated
by the burning of coal and oil. The
bills differ on the extent of reduc-
tions and in their approaches to the
problem.

Stafford is seeking a 50 percent
cut in carbon dioxide by the year
2000. The burden would fall on cars,
which would have to cut carbon di-
oxide emissions in half; power plants,
which would have to cut their use of
fossil fuels in half; and home fur-
naces. Five years after enactment,
all new homes would have to be
equipped with furnaces and water

 

heaters emitting no more [nilliila‘lli
than the best technology the n avaz‘
able.

Wirth's bill, which has 15 :uspun
sors, aims at a 20 percent cut in
carbon dioxide by the year 2000.
An aide said this would be achieved
by increasing efficiency of plants
using fossil fuels and by reducing
the demand for those fuels.

The measure calls for 3 “Least-
Cost National Energy Plan" to be
devised by the government to con-
serve fossil fuels and tap “renew-
able” energy sources, such as wind,
solar, geothermal and hydroelectric
power; a $450 million program over
three years to research and develop
renewable sources; an energy con-
servation plan to cut energy use by
2 to 4 percent annually; and allocat-
ing $500 million to research, devel-
op and demonstrate technologies
for new, safe and cost-efficient nu-
clear reactors.

The most strenuous opposition to
the bills is expected from the utility
and automobile industries, but their
spokesmen withheld comment until
further study.

John Grasser of the National Coal
Association said too little is known
about the greenhouse effect, and it
is “shortsighted to base energy pol-
icy on anticipated environmental
effects that we are not sure will
ever come about.”

Michael Oppenheimer of the En-
vironmental Defense Fund praised
both bills. He said it is important to
invest in renewable sources of en-
ergy so they will become available
later and to impose controls on in-
dustry so they will know “what our
long-tune . ul‘ arr»?

NEW RULES SIGNAL TOUGHER U.S. STANCE AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL

 

BOONDOGGLES: KASTEN

 

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. wlll now lnslst that lnternatlonal development projects
protect environmentally sensltlve wetlands before the U.S. supports prolect fundlng by

lnternatlonal banks, U.S. Sen. Bob Kasten, Fl.-Wla., sald today.

Kasten said new rules issued this week by the Treasury Department "are aimed at
beefing up U.S. efforts to stop development projects in Third World nations that destroy
critical ecosystems, such as wetlands, before they get started."

The "Wetlands Standards" provide voting instructions to the U.S. Executive Directors
of multilateral development banks such as the World Bank, Inter-American Development
Bank, African Development Bank and Asian Development Bank.

Treasury has already drawn up rules for protection of tropical forests and
sub-Saharan savannas, Kasten said, but "the wetlands guidelines are arguably the most
important.

"Wetlands are among the world’s most diverse and productive ecosystems," Kasten
said. "They play critical roles in water purification and storage, habitat protection, and
flood control."

Kasten, ranking member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee,
has been the prime congressional advocate of the environmental guidelines. He said the
wetlands rules ”signal a further resolve on the part of this Administration to toughen up
its act in opposing projects that are environmentally unsound.

"We want to signal our growing willingness to put our environmental cards on the

table in opposing bad projects," he said. "We’re going to be more aggressive in opposing
loans for environmentally unsound projects and in soliciting similar opposition from other
bank member-states."

As a result of legislation Kasten added to the 1989 Foreign Assistance
Appropriations bill, U.S. positions on the environmental consequences of proposed loans
will be shared with other bank member nations to reform, or if necessary defeat, proposed
projects with unacceptable environmental consequences.

Key provisions announced today the following requirements:

0 Wetlands not be adversely impacted unless adequate alternatives have been

considered;

0 Any wetlands alteration must be ecologically sustainable;

0 Projects must protect cultural integrity and property rights of indigenous peoples;

0 Sites identified by the Ramsar (Iran) Convention not be adversely impacted by

projects; and

o Endangered species and biological diversity be protected.

"Like in our domestic ’swampbuster’ requirements, today’s directive by the
Administration recognizes the critical importance of wetlands as the most productive
class of biological systems," Kasten said. "Swamprster" refers to the 1985 Farm Bill
provisions that prohibit federal farm program benefits to those who convert wetlands to
agricultural production.

"Had all three standards (wetlands, tropical forest, and sub-Saharan savannas) been
in place previously, we might have avoided the tragedies of projects like Poloroneste in
Brazil and the Livestock III project in Botswana, Kasten noted.

He added that upcoming projects likely to invoke the new wetlands standards include
the $500 million World Bank Brazil Electric Sector II Project; the $110 million
Inter-American Development Bank Ecuador Daule Peripa Hydroelectric Project and the

additional components of the $953 million World Bank India Narmada Dam and
Resettlement Project.

TO BACK DUKAKIS

National-Coalition of Groups,
Faulting Record of Bush,
Vow to Help Democrat

 

 

 

By PHILIP SHABECOFF
Special to The New York Times '

WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 — Rejecting
Vice President Bush’s recent assertion
that he is an environmentalist, the
political arm of the nation’s major con-
servation groups will‘ endorse the
Presidential candidacy of‘Gov. Michael
S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.

The executive director of the League
of Conservation Voters said today that
the group’s directors believed the
Democratic. nominee would better
serve the environmental needs of the
country. The group’s directors voted on
the endorsement Friday but the league
has not officially announced its deci-
sion.

The executive director, Jim Maddy,

 

said the organization’s review of the
candidates’ records established no rea-'
son to change the league’s prevnous as-

leadership on environmental issues.

Mr. Maddy said environmentalists’
support could be decisive in_ crucial
swing states like California'and New
Jersey, where voters have demon-
strated a concern over pollution issues.

He added that the endorsement
means that millions of members of en-
vironmental organizations would be
notified that Mr. Dukakis is the candi-
date to support. He also said environ-
mentalists would be doing door-to-door
canvassing and placing advertise-
ments for the Democratic candidate.

One national environmental group,

iFriends of the Earth, also decided to
iendorse Mr. Dukakis as an individual
; group, Alan Gussow, president of the
forganization, said the decision was

based on the fact that “Mike Dukakis
has a good environmental record and
George Bush does not.”

Bush’s Actions Assailed

“For the last last eight years,” Mr.
Gussow said, “the Reagan-Bush Ad-
ministration told the oil and coal com-
panies to help themselves to the public
lands, cut the environmental protection
budgets and stopped enforcing environ-
mental laws. Where on earth was Bush
when the environmentneeded him? In
charge of the campaign to deregitlate
environmental controls, that’s where.”

Some individual conservationists
have announced their support for the
Vice President. Three former environ-
mental officials in Republican adminis-
trations have formed a committee of
conservationists to advise Mr. Bush.
They are William D. Ruckelshaus and
Russell E. 'I‘rain, who were Adminis-
trators of the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency, and Nathaniel Reed, who
was an Assistant Secretary of the In-
terior.

Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel
criticized the environ'mentalists’ en-
dorsement decision as “totally and ab-
solutelypredictable.”

“The environmentalists have been in
the pocket of the Democratic national
party since they signed on with Jimmy
Carter and opposed Ronald Reagan in
1980,“ Mr. Hodel said. “Most Amer-
icans support balanced and res‘posive
environmental programs, a fact that is
lost on these people who, in some cases,
have made their organization into par-
tisan organizations.”

Speech Distances Candidate From Reagan

 

By Bill Peterson

Washington Post Staff Writer

 

DETROIT, Aug. 31—Republican
presidential nominee George Bush,
attempting to separate himself from
President Reagan on environmental
issues, said today that if he is
elected he will work to reduce acid
rain, speed the cleanup of toxic

- wastes, beef up enforcement of fed-

eral pollution regulations and bring
a new “conservation ethic” to the
White House.

Declaring “I am an environmen-
talist,” Bush said he would end
ocean dumping by 1991, set a goal
of “no net loss of wetlands,” prevent
offshore oil drilling in sensitive ar-
eas and call an international confer-
ence to discuss global warming and
ozone depletion during his first year
in office.

He also pledged to appoint “the
most qualified individuals in the
land" to run the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency and to expand the
National Park .‘iystem. Bush provid-
ed no details on where new money
would come from to pay for park
expansion or his other proposals.

The speech, delivered before a
group of conservationists gathered
on the shores of Lake Erie about 25
miles south of here, was Bush's
most comprehensive statement on
the environment, and put him at
odds with Reagan administration
policy on a number of issues—~in-
eluding acid rain and toxic-waste
cleanup.

Bush didn’t mention Reagan by

name, and he refused to character-
ize his positions as being tougher
than those of the president. “These
are George Bush’s policies,” he told
reporters. “This is what I’ll do when
I’m elected president.”

Bush adviser Russell Train, a
former head of EPA, wasn't so cau-
tious. “It’s a whole new ball game,”
he said. “It comes through in the
ﬂavor of the speech. and the com-
mitment. It’s a refreshing, long
Overdue, change.”

The environment “hasn’t had a
high priority" for Reagan, said
fTrain, chairman of the World Wild-
life Fund and the Conservation
Foundation.

In Boston, Democratic presiden-
tial nominee Michael S. Dukakis
scoffed at Bush’s remarks, accusing
the vice president of a “last-minute
conversion” to environmental pro-
tection after seven years of “inac-
tion" in the Reagan administration.
[Details on Page A16.]

The volleying over the environ-
ment came as a new Washington
Post-ABC News poll suggests the
presidential race is dead even head-
ing into the Labor Day weekend.
The poll of 1,129 likely voters con-
ducted Aug. 24-30 showed Dukakis
with 48 percent and Bush 47 per-
cent. That was virtually unchanged
from last week’s result, which
showed Bush with 48 percent and
Dukakis with 46 percent. The polls
had a margin of sampling error of
plus or miiiUs 3 percentage points.

Bush’s speech today was de-
signed to increase his appeal to po-
litical .moderates—especially in
such key battle-ground states as
Oregon, Washington, California and
New Jersey—and lay the ground-
work for a round of attacks in up-
coming days on Dukakis’ record on
the environment as governor of
Massachusetts.

“He has a lot of excess baggage
on the environment,” said Mark
Goodin, a Bush deputy press sec-
retary. “I think by the time it is all
over and done with Michael Duka-
kis will be a lot more vulnerable
than he is today.”

On Thursday, Bush plans on tak~
ing his attack on Dukakis’ environ-
mental record to the governor’s
back yard—Deer Island in Boston
Harbor. Attempts to clean up the
sludge-clogged harbor have
dragged on for years, and federal
officials say Boston is far behind
other port cities ill its efforts.

Bush strategists believe that the

harbor cleanup provides an ideal ,

opening to challenge Dukakis, who
recently broke ground for a new
waste treatment plant there. “Ev—
ery day, 2,300 pounds of toxic

wastes and 70 tons of sludge are ‘

added to the cesspool the governor
has created out of Boston Harbor,”
one Bush campaign source said.

The Reagan administration has
long been a target of environmental
groups for what they say has been
its general neglect of the environ-
ment and lax regulation of industrial
polluters.

Under Reagan, the EPA has been
blamed first for politicizing the se-
lection of sites for toxic waste
cleanups, then for squandering bil-
lions of dollars on “band-aid" rem-
edies that resulted in only a handful
of completed cleanups in several
years: failing to meet congres-
sionally deadlines on regulation of
water and air pollution; and resist-
ing efforts to control acid rain.

“The past eight years have
brought many delays, some actual
backsliding and a myriad of missed
opportunities to protect human
health and the environment,” said
Jessica Landman of the Natural Ree
sources Defense Council.

Bush campaign officials acknowl-
edge they could have trouble estab-
lishing credibility on environmental
issues. “We’re a little behind the
'curve on it in terms of public per-
ception," Goodin said.

Bush’s speech today was laced
with specific proposals and tough-
sounding rhetoric. The EPA, Bush
said, should use its authority to sue
toxic-waste polluters for triple dam-
ages. “Those who are responsible

for the dumping should be respon-
sible for the cleanup. Polluters
should pay,” he said.

Bush indirectly criticized the ad-
ministration on toxic-waste cleanup,
noting that the Superfund program
“has the money. But we can use it
faster and more efficiently. We can

'make greater use of the EPA’s

emergency authority to step in and
clean up immediately.”

Although the Superfund program
is flush with more than $9 billion
through 1992, its funding was ap-
proved by Congress in 1986 over
the objections of the administration,
which sought about half as much.

Superfund has been criticized for
its slow response to toxic-waste
problems, its reliance on short-term
fixes rather than the permanent
remedies favored by Congress and
its light treatment of toxic-waste
dumpers. Fines have averaged less
than 10 percent of the money that
polluters have saved by illegal
dumping of wastes, according to
Hugh Kaufman of the EPA’s haz-
ardous site control division.

On acid rain, Bush said that the
“time for study alone has passed."
He said he would cut “millions of
tons of sulfur dioxide emissions by
the year 2000, and to significantly
reduce nitrogen oxide emissions."

In the past, Reagan has questioned
the overwhelming scientific evidence
that acid rain is caused by sulfur di-
oxide and nitrogen oxides, and called
for more study of the problem. He
has consistently opposed legislative
efforts to cut back emissions of the
two pollutants, which transform in
the atmosphere and come down as
acid rain and snow.

The administration’s failure has
strained U.S. relations with Canada,
where lakes and forests have been
damaged by acid rain originating in
the American Midwest. Bush was
sent to Ottawa in January 1987 to
appease Prime Minister Brian Mul-
roney, whose popularity was sag-
ging because of his failure to obtain
acid-rain concessions from the ad-
ministration.

On water pollution, Bush called
for a policy of “zero tolerance . . .
not only to those who poison our
children’s minds with drugs, but to
those who poison our water with
toxic chemicals."

The administration has been less
forceful on this issue, failing to
meet congressionally imposed dead-
lines for regulating pesticide and
toxic-chemical discharges, control-
ling toxic chemicals in Sewage
sludge and ending ocean dumping.

In January 1987, Reagan vetoed
legislation providing $20 billion to
clean up US. waterways, calling
the measure too expensive and too
dependent on federal funding. Con-
gress overrode the veto, releasing

to clean up the Venice lagoon.

The money will be spent over the
next two years on various projects
aimed at restoring the lagoon’s

Deadly Combination Felling Trees in East

By PHILIP SHABECOFF

Special to The New York Times

MOUNT MITCHELL, NC, July
19 — Thousands of dead trees,
their barren trunks and branches
stark against a hazy sky, stand like
an army of skeletons as far as the
eye can see along the crest of this
mountain. .

Five years ago a red spruce for-
est covered the top of Mount Mitch-
ell, the highest mountain east of
the Mississippi. Today, only rasp-
berry and blackberry bushes,
clumps of sedge and a few young
trees, brown and dying, cover the
ground near the summit.

This stark evidence is forcing
many scientists to accept a conclu-
sion that seemed only a possibility
five years ago: air pollution, in-
cluding acids in the air, is combin-
ing with natural stresses to cause
heavy damage to forests through-
out the East.

“What you see here is happening
all along the crest of the Appala-
chians from Maine to Georgia,”
said Prof. Robert 1. Bruck of North
Carolina State University, a plant
pathologist.

Dr. Bruck observed early symp-
toms of the decline of Mount Mitch-
ell’s spruce and fir five years ago.
Now the ecological system at the
summit has collapsed, he said.

‘Canary in the Coal Mine’

Dr. Bruck said he was “90 per—
cent certain” that manmade air
pollution traveling from the Ohio
and Tennessee valleys, particu-
larly low-level ozone and acidic
moisture in clouds, was combining
with such natural stresses as the
high temperatures and drought of
recent years to create an environ-
ment in which the trees cannot sur-
Vive.

So far, the effects are chiefly vis-
ible at high altitudes, where natu-

ral stresses are greatest and acidic
clouds are nearest. But a number
of scientists who believe that high
levels of air pollution are instru-
mental in destroying coniferous
forests at high altitudes in the East
also expressed another fear in in-
terviews over the past few days.

They warned that the death of
the mountaintop spruce and fir for-
ests might be what several of them
called “the canary in the coal
mine” — an early warning that for-
ests of low altitudes, including
hardwood forests, are also in dan-
ger of being damaged by a combi-
nation of man-made and natural
stresses.

Dr. Bruck said the damage he is
seeing on 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell
seems similar to the early stages
of the mass destruction of forests
in recent years in central Europe.

Dr Bruck and the other scimtists
inn-viewed said that the role of air
pollution in killing the trees was
still a hypothesis rather than a

scientific fact. But virtually all con-
tended that prudence dictated action.

Of most serious concern, the scien-
tists said, are ozone and acidity in
clouds, rain, snow and dust. Ozone is
formed at ground level by the reaction
of sunlight with manmade pollutants
from automobile exhaust, industry and
a variety of small sources.

While ozone in the upper atmosphere
shields the earth from damaging ultra-
violet radiation from the sun, ground
level ozone contributes to smog, respi-
ratiory damage to people and damage
to trees and crops. Acid rain, clouds,
snow and dust are formed when pollu-
tants, chiefly oxides of nitrogen and
sulfur from coal-fired power plants,
are transformed chemically as they
travel through the atmosphere. Acid
rain has been found by scientists to be
destroying life in lakes and streams in
the Northeast and Canada.

But while the ill effects of these pollu-
tants have been documented, scientists
say it is difficult to separate their influ-
ence from climate or other possible
factors. The problem is complicated by
the fact that scientists only began in—
tensive studies of forests a decade ago.

‘We Should Not Wait’

Volker H. Mohnen, a professor of at-
mospheric science at the State Univer-
sity of New York at Albany, who has
watched half the spruce trees atop
Whiteface Mountain in upstate New
York die in recent years, said that
while it has not been conclusively
proved that air pollution added to natu-
ral stress is killing the trees, “1 would
advocate housekeeping before all the
answers are in.”

“We should not wait,” he said. “We
must address the problem holistical-
ly.))
He said that a variety of pollutants
released by the combustion of fossil
fuel, including sulfur, nitrogen and car-
bon, might not only be damaging for-
ests but also might be contributing to
other crucial problems like urban
smog, acidic lakes and global warming,
the greenhouse effect.

There are, Dr. Mohnen said, “eco-
nomic and technological solutions to
improve our fossil fuel-based society
by increasing efficiency and, at the
same time, decrease emissions of sul-
fur, nitrogen and carbon."

There is also growing evidence that
air pollution may be damaging or slow-‘
ing the growth of trees in other parts of
the country, according to David l.

Forests at lower
levels could also
be in danger.

 

 

 

Radloff, a United States Forest Service
representative on the Administration's
program to study acid rain. He said
evidence in recent years supported the
hypothesis that high ozone concentra-
tions were contributing to the decling-i
ing growth rate of southern yellow pine
trees, one of the nation’s more impor-
tant commercial species. There are
also indications that ozone and other
airborne pollutants are damaging
trees along virtually the whole length
of the Sierras in California, he said.

Opinion Has Evolved

Forest Service officials had been ex-
tremely skeptical until recently that
air pollution might play a significant
role in slowing the growth of trees and
damaging forests. Dr. Radloff said that
the evidence linking the declining
health of forests and the high levels of i
pollution reaching those forests was"
still “circumstantial.”

(continued)

The World Research Institute, a
Washington-based research and policy
group, has had a team of scientists m—i
vestigating the potential effect of mul-
tiple air pollutants on trees and field
crops. Mohamed El-Ashry, the group’s
vice president for research and policy,
said that the research over the last two
years had demonstrated “systematic
links” between air pollution and the de-
struction of trees and crops in all parts
of the country.

Dr. El-Ashry also said the deaths of
trees reflected the end of a long pro-
cess reflecting the accumulated stress
of air pollution stretching back for dec-
ades. “By the time we see visible dam-

 

age it is the beginning of the end,” he
said.

Acid air pollution and ozone, Dr. El-‘
Ashry said, had been found to weaken,
trees to the point where “they cannot
avoid destruction by natural causes
such as frosts, high winds, insects and
disease.”

He also said the group’s researchers

had been finding that the forests dying ‘

along the Eastern Seaboard cannot
regenerate because of high levels of
lead and other heavy metals in the soil.

Scientific Disagreement

Not all those with an immediate in-
terest in the nation’s forests agree that.
air pollution is a threat to the nation’s
forests. Robert C. Kaufman, director of
the air quality program 3f the Amer-
ican Paper Institute and National For—

est Products Association, industry
groups, said that “there is no evidence
that acid deposition is affecting the sml
of commercial forests.”

He asserted, “We do not see conclu-

’ Canada are experiencing stress at high
and low altitudes. The stress comes
from air pollution and from climate ex-
tremes we have seen in recent years
from the greenhouse effect. What is
going on is an indicator that the natural

! environment is in very, very deep trou-

* ble due to air pollution.

“Those mountain tops sit in a chemi-
cal soup made of ozone, acid fog and
acid deposition, which puts them under
continual stress. It is starting to look as
if those stressed systems are snapping
like rubber bands.”

The soup has been especially potent
on the top of Mount Mitchell in this hot,
dry.summer. It is widely agreed, Dr.
Bruck said, that ozone levels of 55 parts
per billion in the air are enough to

. cause physiological damage to spruce

and fir trees. Measurements taken by
his research team, he reported, have
shown that since May 1, ozone levels
have been above that level 90 percent

lOf the time; more than 120 parts per

billion 28 percent of the time, and once
reached a high of 178 parts per billion.
Moreover. the ozone has remained
owr the mountain through the night in-
stead of dissipating as it normally does
in lower latitudes, he said.

Dr. Bruck has also noted a rapid de-
terioration of the forest down the slope,
all the way to the transition line be-
tween the coniferous and hardwood
trees. Dr. Bruck said he had observed
some damge to the hardwood trees but
that there had not been any studies of
the extent or the cause of the damage
to these trees.

and dying trees several thousand feet
below the summit of Mount Mitchell,

mercial forests.”

Mr. Kaufman added that the indus-
try saw no need for a regulatory pro-
gram to curb acid rain, but that it did
support more research into the effects
of acid rain.

Walter L. Warnick, whorepresents
the Energy Department on the Admin-
istration’s acid rain study program,
said that the death of trees on a large
scale “is not unprecedented in histo-
ry.” He also said that the scientific con—
sensus that pollution from fossil fuels is
damaging trees is “shaky.”

Several scientists have contended
that the trees are dying because of cli-
matic factors, particularly the hot
summers and cold winters of recent
years. 4

mospheric physicist with the Environ-

Wildlife Refuge
Is Contaminated
With Mercury
Poison May Endanger

New Orleans Project

By FRANCES FRANK MARCUS
Special to The New York Times

NEW ORLEANS, Sept. 8 — The
United States Fish and Wildlife Service
said here today that high levels of mer-
cury, a deadly poison, had been found
in a proposed national wildlife refuge
within the New Orleans city limits.

Traces of mercury were found in
Federal tests in the proposed refuge,
an 18,500-acre marshy wildlife habitat
in the eastern part of the city that has
been viewed for decades by developers
as a place for subdivisions and shop-
ping centers. More recently, the city
has regarded the land as a logical spot
for a new airport.

But conservationists promoted the
area as a nature refuge, and they pre-
vailed with the help of city leaders hop-
ing for more tourist dollars in an econ-
omy depressed by low oil prices.

 

 

 

THE NEW YORK TiMES, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 1988

Federal, state and local officials met
here today to hear the test results, re-
ceived by the Department of the ln-
terior last month, and to discuss the
possible consequences.

Acquisition to Be Pursued

But Federal officials emphasized
that, while mercury was found in sedi-

ment and in fish, more data were1

needed to evaluate the damage. Addi-
tional test results will be available in
October.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, which
is part of the Interior Department, in-
tends “to pursue acquisition of the
land," said Phillip Morgan, 3 regional
agency official in Atlanta. But he
added, “We are not going to acquire a
contaminated area that’s then going to
become our problem.”

Among the questions that must be
answered, he said, are, “How can it be
corrected and can it be corrected?”

Unusually high levels of mercury
were found in sediment, and lesser
amounts in fish. The mercury is appar-
ently leaking from an adjacent landfill
used for city garbage disposal, a failed
recycling project that had been under-
taken in the 1970’s.

Earlier this summer tests found that
oxygen in water next to the landfill was

minous in the

nearly depleted.

According to a state official, the land
fill, operated by the American Waste
and Pollution Control Company, a sub-
sidiary of Waste Management of North
America lnc., which is the largest han-
dler of waste in the nation, has been the
source of many violations of state regu-
lations in the 1980’s, including failure to
cover up garbage.

“Inspectors would find exposed
wastes, garbage of all kinds, which can
blow around and rain can wash into the
waterways,” said Tim Hardy of the
Louisiana Department of Environmen-
tal Quality in Baton Rouge.

Don Clark, the president of Amer-
ican Waste and Pollution Control, said
today that the violations occurred in a
time when the state was indecisive
about what its regulations should be.

Conservationists here say the refuge,

 

to he named the Bayou Siiiwage Lirlvm
National Wildlife Refuge, would be un-
usual not only because of its size and
variety of wildlife but also because it
lies within the city‘s borders, about 15
miles from the central business dis-
trict.

The refuge was authorized by Con-
gress in 1986 following negotiations
among representatives of the property
owner, Southpoint lnc., a subsidiary of
Merrill Lynch & Company lnc., and the
city, state environmental groups and
political leaders.

$8 Million Appropriated

Congress has appropriated $8 million
to buy the land and for initial opera-
tions of the refuge.

The agreement set aside 18,500 acres
of lakes, forest and marshland for the
refuge and an additional 6,500 acres for
private and commercial development
that would not harm the area’s wildlife,
which includes deer, otters, alligators
and a wide variety of waterfowl.

In a census last year scientists found
almost 60,000 birds, including teal, coot,
snowy egrets, the great blue heron and
other species in the freshwater marsh-
es, moss-draped hardwood forest and
tidal marsh that which make up the

, giant urban wetlands.

There have been indications of leaks
in the New Orleans landfill for two
years, said Oliver A. Houck, a law pro-
fessor at Tulane University and a lead-
ing environmentalist in the state, but
there was no inkling that the dump, de-
signed for household garbage, con-
tained mercury.

A Poisoned Paradise

“I’m sick about this,” he said.
“We’ve poisoned the richest wildlife
paradise in America, and that’s a
tragedy.”

He called mercury “one of the most

poisonous compounds in nature,” add-
ing: “it doesn’t dissolve in water or
bodies. It just stays in tissue and builds
up.”
Chronic exposure to mercury, either
through breathing mercury vapor or
ingesting compounds containing mer-
cury, can cause diarrhea, inflamma-
tion of the mouth, tremors, difficulty in
speaking or walking and other neuro-
logical problems such as irritability,
apprehension and depression.

In cases of chronic poisoning, mer-
cury can be removed from the body
through chelation, a process in which
the patient is administered a drug that
binds to the mercury so that it can be
excreted from the body.

GUEST ‘

EDITORIAL
By John Aspinall

t must be becoming clear to

more and more people with

every week that passes and

with every statistic that slaps

us in the face that most of the

perils that now confront the planet

stem from our own uncontrolled

population growth. The horror of five

billion humans—5.000 for every one

there was a mere million years ago—

is now squarely upon us and about to
get worse—much worse.

The already grotesque overburden

of human numbers is expected to

grow to between eight and eleven

billion before it is likely to plateau off

some time in the early part ofthe next
century. According to a report I read
recently in The Daily Telegraph.
demographers expect (‘hina‘s popu—
lation to reach 1.285 million within 12
years. Small comfort can be taken
from the fact that population growth
has levelled off in the highly
developed countries over the past few
decades. These industrialised states
are now supporting the maximum
numbers that can be sustained in the
short term. and their citizens eon—
sume. on average. about 30 times as
much energy and resources. per
capita. as those of the Third World.
Thus. the 120 million Japanese have a
greater damaging impact on world
resources than the whole population
of China and India combined.

It is hard to find a single planetary
threat that does not have its origin in
gross. short-term human need. Trop-
ical forests which support more than a
million diverse species are scalped for
cash. cattle and monocultural food
production. Fossil deposits that have
taken millions of years to form are
burned into the atmosphere to keep
the mounting billions warm and
mobile. The consequences of such
profligacy are only now dimly being
understood and at an hour so late that
many doubt whether the collision
course we are on is avoidable. let
alone reversible. Widespread clima-
tic distortions such as greenhouse—
effect storms. gashes in the delicate
fabric of the ozone curtain and other
equally disturbing phenomena are
reported daily.

Each week we read or hear of some
gathering disaster. It seems. from the
latest reports. that inland and land-
locked seas are dying fast. In April we
heard of the creeping eutrophication
of the northern Adriatic—caused
largely by the contamination of the

river Po. now nothing more than a
cheap sewage duct for Milan and
Turin. And in May we read of the
fatal degradation of the Aral Sea and
the Sea of Asov accompanied by the
shrinkage of the fragile Caspian.

The news that the USSR was
reconsidering her abandoned plans to
divert the rivers Ob and Tobol to irri-
gate vast new areas of Kazakhstan for
cotton and wheat production filled
me with foreboding. A few weeks ago
I saw a report that the whole of the
Baltic beyond the Seaggerak was now
acknowledged to be in its death
throes. The corpses of 300 grey seals
had already been picked up and mill-
ions of fish were dying. Apparently
agricultural pollutants and industrial
toxic waste. the two ugly sisters.
were. as usual. mainly to blame.

When the inland and land—locked
seas become sterilised. who can seri-
ously doubt that the oceans will fol-
low‘.’ The great seas that cover three—
quarters of the earth are already
dangerously changed. Long-line fish-
ing fleets. accompanied by huge
factory ships. are scouring the high
seas for bulk catches. and although
Japan and the USSR are probably the
worst offenders. we are all impli-
cated.

The concept that one land mam-
mal. out of thousands. could eventu—

ally level a threat at the basic life

systems of the oceans would have
seemed impossible to even the wisest
and most far-seeing of our recent for-
bears. such as Malthus or Darwin.
and yet this is the case today.

Almost interminable is the list of

fauna and flora that we have exter-
minated in our brief but inglorious
reign as a species. Even the ‘building
blocks‘ of animal and plant life have
not escaped: in our feeding frenzy we
are savaging the relict whales at'one
end of the food chain and krill at the
other. and while seven million sharks
are killed annually. heretofore com-
mon pelagic species of zooplankton
and phytoplankton are also disap-
pearing fast.

On land. things are hardly any
better. Entire ecosystems have been
reduced to remnant status. with
species of plant or animal disappear-
ing at the rate of one a week. As I
write. reports are coming in from
East Africa that elephant numbers
are now in precipitous and what looks
like terminal decline—following. no
doubt. the example of the black
rhino. which is now on the very thresh-
old of extinction throughout Africa.

The readers of BBC WILDLIFE know
very well what is happening. In real-
ity it is a terrible experience just to
know-George Schaller once said.

“those who know the most fear the
most.“ He said that 20 years ago. and
