produce pain or disease in any living animal, including the cutting.
wounding or poisoning thereof, except when the same is for the purpose
of curing or alleviating some physical suffering or disease in such living
animal or in order to deprive it of life when incurable.

SEC. 3.—-This act shall take effect immediately.

MEMORIAL TO THE LEGISLATURE OF
THE STATE OF NEW’ YORK.

The memorial shows :—

First—That your memorialist is president of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals, a corporation created by this State for the
purpose of enforcing its laws for the protection of and prevention of
cruelty to animals.

Second—That the Legislature of this State has from time to time
passed divers good and humane laws to prevent the inﬂiction of unneces-
sary physical pain, suffering and death upon the brute creation, and has
made such inﬂiction a criminal offense.

Third—That by an Act of the Legislature of this State, passed in the
year 1867, it was provided that the laws aforesaid should not be con-
strued to prohibit or interfere with any properly conducted scientiﬁc ex-
periments or investigations, which experiments shall be performed only
under authority of the faculty of some regularly incorporated medical
college or university of the State of New York.

Fourth—Your memorialist further shows that divers learned and
scientiﬁc, but misguided, medical men have perverted the meaning and
intention of such exception, and, under the pretense of demonstrating to
medical students certain physical phenomena connected with the func-
tions of life, are constantly and habitually in the practice of cutting up
alive, torturing and tormenting divers of the unoffending brute creation
to illustrate their theories and lectures, but without any practical or
beneﬁcial result either to themselves or to the students : which practice is
demoralizing to both, and engenders in the future medical practitioners
a want of humanity and sympathy for physical pain and suffering which
will greatly deteriorate their inﬂuence in their future professional life.

Fifth—Your memorialist further shows that this matter of vivisecting
animals for the so-called “scientiﬁc” purposes has been the subject of
discussion and universal condemnation by the more eminent members of
the medical profession in Europe, and that notably in the English Par-
liament a bill has been introduced (and it received the support of the '
most prominent members of that body) to wholly suppress this barbarous

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10

and unjustiﬁable sacriﬁce of animal life and inﬂiction of unnecessary
physical pain, suffering and death upon the brute creation.

Sixth—Your memorialist, therefore, prays that your honorable body
will, without delay, enact a statute to prevent absolutely this practice of
vivisection, and to that end he submits herewith, for your consideration,
a proposed act, with the earnest hope that it will receive due and im-
mediate consideration. And your memorialist will ever pray, etc.

The foregoing was kindly introduced in the Senate, by
Senator Robert Strahan; and in the Assembly, by the Hon.
Edward Mitchell; and received the unusual compliment of
having been read aloud in both houses amid profound attention.

 

COURT OF APPEALS.

THE Court of Appeals recently rendered another decision in
favor of the Society. A car driver on a cross-town railroad
having been indicted by the grand jury on the charge of driv-
ing a disabled horse, the railroad company entered a plea of
guilty in the Court of General Sessions, whereupon Judge
Gildersleeve imposed a ﬁne of two hundred dollars. The com-
pany appealed, and carried the case before the highest tribunal,
which sustained the lower court, and the company ultimately
paid the ﬁne.

N

OBI T UA RIES.

THE Society has to mourn the loss of several warm friends
of the cause, among them Mrs. George Bell, Lawson Boyer,
and as we go to press with this report we learn of the demise
of the lamented Mr. Frank Leslie. He was an active member
of the Board of Managers since the organization of the Society,
and ably and liberally seconded, by all the valuable means at
his command, itsefforts in behalf of defenseless dumb animals.

SECRETARY’S REPORT.

IN presenting the Fourteenth Annual Report to the

friends of the Society, the Secretary feels satisﬁed its peru-
sal will show that the humane work is being prosecuted
with the same Vigilance as heretofore.
_ During the past year the correspondence with kindred
Societies, at home and abroad, has been very extensive and
interesting, especially with those of Naples, Turin, Cadiz,
Copenhagen, and Halifax, N. S.

At home the cause is gradually spreading, and the States
of Arkansas and Alabama have recently fallen into line.

In the State of New York the Parent Society has 713
branches, and 199 agencies at work. From the reports re-
ceived it is gratifying to ﬁnd that cruelty to dumb animals
is on the decrease.

THE DOG l’OUND.

DURING the summer the constant supervision of the Society’s
agents was necessary to prevent the abuse of the animals cap-
tured in the streets, and several of the city dog catchers were
arrested and punished for cruelty to their victims. The pound
master was also compelled to provide proper food and better
ventilation in the building. Nearly seven thousand animals
Were destroyed in as humane a manner as possible, and under
the supervision of the ofﬁcers of the Society.

of the Society have been given to the public. Short stories,
sketches, and other interesting miscellany, appropriate to
the character of the paper, have tended largely to increase
its circulation, and make it valuable as a household journal.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

 

As the President’s Address and the Reports of the
Treasurer and Secretary give the members a full summary
of the work of the Society during the year just closed, the
Committee deem it unnecessary to make a separate re—
port.

They, however, congratulate the members upon the con-
tinued prosperity of the Society.

It will be seen by reference to the tabular statements in
the Secretary’s Report, that the usefulness of the Society
has been rapidly extended since its organization in 1866.
It is impossible to estimate the amount of suffering pre-
vented by the 7,555 convictions obtained, While the moral
effect of the efforts made in 18,384 other cases, to check
habits and conduct before they become amenable to the
law, has also shielded thousands of animals from many
violent atrocities. The sympathy of private individuals,
and the enforced interference of the police, brought about
by the Society’s earnest labors, have also secured the con-
viction of many offenders.

ent parts of our city. The Society has ﬁfteen already, and
Continues to increase the number as often as its funds
allow. A most appropriate form of donation could be
made on the part of the friends of animals, by the crec-
tion of fountains, under the direction of the Society, bear-
ing the names of the donors.

PRESIDENT’S REPORT.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN :

I THE good example which we, fourteen years ago, as a Soci-
ety, presented to the Republic for acceptance and adoption by
the sister States and Territories, leaves only thirteen to be
united to the Humane Confederacy ; to wit: Alabama, Florida,
Mississippi, Nevada, Alaska, Arizona, Dakota, Idaho, Indian,
Montana, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming.

As a Society, and as individuals, we may justly feel proud
of an achievement, in the interests of humanity and civiliza-
tion, which has few parallels and no superior.

The latest addition to the honorable list of States which
have associated themselves in the benevolent work of protect—

mg dependent animals from wanton cruelty, is the State of
Arkansas. It is a pleasurable duty to make known to you
that to Mr. C. J. Peshell—a descendant of the great author of the
“ Martin Act,” ﬁrst presented to the British Parliament more
than ﬁfty years ago, for the protection of animals—we are in-
debted for the incipient steps taken, which enable me to an-
nounce to you this gratifying intelligence.

Nearly a year ago, this gentleman—once a member of the
legislature of that State—called at these headquarters, and
assured me that by putting myself in. correspondence with
some members, whose names he‘ gave me, this desirable object
could be effected. I need hardly add that I lost no time in so
doing, and, having furnished Governor ”Miller and Senators
Boyd and Miller, and Mr. W. H._Naulty with the draft of a
law, which I regard as the most perfect one in existence, being
augmented and amended by our extensive experience, those
honorable gentlemen accomplished its unanimous passage in a
surprising brevity of time.

Reluctant, it seems, to be outdone by neighboring States;
Alabama and Mississippi are at the present time inquiring
the way to be admitted amongst us. To those appeals I have
of course responded. , .

- At the last session of the Legislature of this State, an Act
was rather hastily passed, in the interests of a cross-town rail-
way, ostensibly designed to prevent obstructions to surface
roads generally, but more particularly aimed at this Society,
with a view of preventing its interference with its horses, when
found in a condition, by our ofﬁcers, unﬁt for service. I am
pleased to inform you that this effort to exempt from the
operations of a necessary law the animals employed by that
corporation, has signally failed—the Courts and magistrates
ruling that it has no application to our sphere of action. .

As a conSequence, however, of the misinterpretation of that
“Act,” by the company inquestion, which went so far as to
cause the arrest of one of ' our Ofﬁcers while enforcing the
general law, an action is pending in a civil court for damages,
which, I have little doubt, Will result in a verdict for our side,

RE GEN T B (ILL-FIGHTS IN SPAIN.

I need not detain you long with a reference to the action
which I thought it advisable to take, in connection with kin-
dred societies of Europe, in reference to the marriage festivi-
ties of the King and Queen of Spain, as you have probably
already learned the details through the press. Sufﬁce it to
say, that it was regarded by those societies as an auspicious
moment to respectfully interfere in the name of humanity and
civilization, and to ask for the omission from the programme
of the barbarous and demoralizing spectacle of bull-ﬁghting.

I regret to say that neither the entreaties of the fair and
tender—hearted Austrian Princess, to that end; nor the humble

suggestions of the united societies of Europe and America

were enabled to mitigate in the least the heartless and dis-
gusting 'slaughter of innocent unoﬁ’ending animals, to gratify
an instinct, alike degrading to national honor and dignity,
and an insult to the spirit and practices of the age in which
we live. It is to be hoped, however, that the emancipation of
the slaves, now in contemplation by that government, may lead
to the ﬁnal abolition of this hateful national pastime.

B URN IN G ANIMALS ALIVE.

No statute seems to be more necessary than one for the pro»

tection of horses and other animals conﬁned in stables and
elsewhere, whereby the almost continual recurrence of great
numbers being burned alive may be averted. Such a bill was
introduced at the last term of the Legislature by the Society,
and passed by the lower House; but failed of concurrence in
the Senate; owing to the defection of the Senator to Whom it
was intrustcd, and who, to the amazement of all right-think-
ing persons, avowed that he had deliberately “killed it.”
. It may be almost positively asserted that had that measure
been permitted to become a law, as it certainly would have
been, except for the unhappy inﬂuence of the member in ques-
tion, the recent great destruction .;»of horses would not have
occurred.

VI VISECTI 01V.

The atrocious and perpetual cruelties inﬂicted on helpless
dumb animals in the name of science is awakening, in many
States of Europe, a profound hostility to their continuation.

In Great Britain, an inﬂuential Society for the Total Suppres-
sion of Vivisection has been formed, under the patronage and
direction of many of the most distinguished men of the kin g«
dom; and we should be neglectful of our duty, were we not
to exert our inﬂuence here in America to the same end.

It may be remembered by some of the members, that several
years ago I opened a discussion on the subject in the press,
which was conducted on the adverse side by a very learned
physiologist of this city; but resulted only at that time in
calling public notice to the horrors of the practice. During
the past few months I have again conducted a second discus-
sion of the same, wherein I have employed the evidence of the
most prominent physiologists, and even vivisectors themselves,
to prove the cruelty and futility of all such demoralizing and
barbarous experiments.

I am at this time making suitable preparations to place the
entire matter before the Legislature of this State; and what-
ever may be the issue of my efforts, I'shall at least feel that
this Society has put itself right upon the record by which it is
bound by every obligation of humanity to act.

The following is the “ Bill” and “Memorial” which I have
prepared. with the able assistance of our counsel, Mr. Gerry,
to lay before the Legislature at its forthcoming session:

AN ACT TO PROHIBIT THE VIVISECTION
OF ANIMALS.

The people of New York, represented in Senate and Assembly, do
enact as follows :

SECTION 1.~—Every person who shall perform or cause to be performed
or assist in performing in or upon any living animal an act of vivisection
Shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

SEC. 2.——The term “ vivisection” used in this act shall include every
investigation, experiment or demonstration producing, or of a nature to

AJIIB ULANCE AND DERRICK WORII.

The ambulances of the Society, which are kept ready for
service night and day, removed 197 disabled. horses from
the streets, and the derrick and slings, made expressly for
the purpose, were the means of rescuing many horses and
other animals from excavations, etc., into which they had
fallen.

TRANSPORTATION 0F ANIMALS.

This important subject has received careful consideration,
and nearly every vessel carrying cattle from this port during
the past season, was inspected by the agents of the Society,
before the animals were shipped.

The transportation of animals upon railroads, however,
and the terrible cruelties resulting therefrom continue, not-
withstanding all the efforts made to provide adequate meas-
ures to remedy the evils.

The American Humane Association of Chicago, of which
Edwin Lee Brown is President, has offered a premium. of
ﬁve thousand dollars for the best cattle-car.

In a sanitary point of View alone, without regard to the
humanity involved, something "should be speedily done to
modify the sufferings of animals destined for human food.
Much has already been attempted in this direction, and
recently the model of a car was submitted to President
Bergh, by Messrs. Tallman & Hait, of this city, which, in
his opinion, united all the requisites for the healthful and
humane transportation of animals, either by rail or vessel.
