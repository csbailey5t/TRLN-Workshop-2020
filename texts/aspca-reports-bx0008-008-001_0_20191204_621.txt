ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT.

Ladies and Gem/6mm :

Since the initiatory steps were taken to call into existence our
beloved Society, having for its object the protection of those
speechless servants of mankind, which minister in so many ways
to our happiness and proﬁt, a quarter of a century has nearly
elapsed. It is not my purpose, however, at this time, to review
the work accomplished during that long period, nor the unremit-
ting labor devoted thereto with a ﬁdelity and zeal worthy ofisuch
a cause, and which have produced such beneﬁcent results.

In View of what has been accomplished in the past, I am fully
conscious of the great responsibilities I assumed when I accepted
the honorable ofﬁce of President of your Society.

In presenting this, the twenty-fourth annual report of the
Society’s work, I will but brieﬂy allude to a few matters of inter-
est, believing that you Will—ﬁnd in the detailed reports of the
Executive Committee, Treasurer, and Superintendent, more
gratifying information.

It affords me much pleasure, however, to announce, that your
ofﬁcial residence has been remodelled, and made more conven-
ient for the needs of your Society, and the preservation and
compilation of accumulated records and reports relating thereto,
and which may be required in the distant future, to give to a new
people the history of the birth and progress of the Parent
Institution on this Continent, having for its object not only the
protection of defenceless dumb creatures, but by practice and
precept to inculcate in the minds of the people sentiments of
kindness and forbearance towards the helpless.

Other changes have also been made, having in View better
sanitary conditions, and conveniences for the ofﬁcers attached to
Head-quarters.

has replaced the one formerly in use in front of the building, and
many other improvements added to the premises, having for their
object increased facilities for carrying on the work of humanity.

The necessity for improved methods pertaining to the Ambu-
lance and derrick service, prompted your Executive Committee
to set apart a portion of the funds of the Society towards the
purchase of land, and the erection thereon of a suitable building
for that purpose. This has been accomplished, and now, in
addition to your ofﬁcial headquarters, you have an Ambulance
house for the housing of the vehicles, also horses, and patent
quick»acting harness of simple contrivance, but which possesses
great advantages over the ordinary kind, all of which reduce the
time of departure to a minimum, in order to despatch relief to a
suffering animal in the street.

In addition to the improvements mentioned, kennels for the
care and comfort of all kinds of small animals have been provided
in the building; likewise an apartment for the humane destruc-
tion of those found sick, injured, or otherwise disabled.

The patrol wagon ‘service has been extended and improved.
Hardly a day passes but what the usefulness of this department
of our work is demonstrated, as the following incident will show :

The shaft of a passing vehicle entered the body of a horse that
was standing on Broadway near 20th Street. The wound was a
terrible one, and no doubt the poor creature would have bled to
death but for the opportune arrival of the patrol wagon with
bandages and liniments. While engaged in dressing the wound,
the ambulance arrived, into which the suffering animal was
placed, and taken to the hospital. Under the old system this
would have taken nearly an hour, during which time the horse
would have had to remain on the street pending the arrival of the
vehicle and assistance.

An informal inspection of the work as conducted by the several
branch organizations of the Society throughout the upper part of
the State convinced me that, while not as complete as might be
desired, owing no doubt to opposing inﬂuences which are to be
found in all communities, it is still conducted in a satisfactory
and vigorous manner.

 




 

7

I was, however, greatly exercised at the condition of the horses
and mules employed on the towpaths of the several canals of the
State. It seems to me that the sphere of the usefulness of your
Society should be extended in that direction, and aggressive
measures instituted during the entire season. Ofﬁcers should be
stationed along, and thoroughly police, the canal districts. This
course of action would require a large expenditure of money,
but the misery and physical suffering which it would prevent to
the defenceless dumb creatures, compelled to toil daily, as a
motive power, with ghastly wounds on their bodies unprotected
from the galling harness, would compensate a thousand-fold for
the outlay.

In addition to this phase of the work, there are many other
places where large numbers of animalsare employed — viz.,
quarries, brick yards, and lumber districts, — over which the
Society could extend its protecting authority, if the condition of
its treasury would permit.

In closing this, my ﬁrst annual address, allow me to Wish you a
prosperous and happy New Year.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE.

The Executive Committee of the Society congratulates its
members, and all friends of the cause of animal protection,
upon the continued and ever increasing spread of the good
work ; also upon the recent acquisition for the furtherance of its
usefulness of many practical appliances for the immediate relief
of suffering animals.

Inasmuch as the several reports of the President and Superin-
tendent give ample details of the general work done during the
past year ; likewise that of the Treasurer, as to its ﬁnancial con-
dition, your Committee will conﬁne itself brieﬂy to matters com-
ing within the immediate sphere of its duty.

The Committee reports the election of Mr. James M. Brown
to be President of the Society, Vice Henry Bergh, resigned.

Also the resignation of Mr. Edwin Bergh as a member of the
Executive Committee.

Also that on April 12th, last, much to the regret of your Com—
mittee, President Brown tendered his resignation, assigning as
the reason therefor important business and other duties which
required his almost constant attention. While regretfully accep-
ting the resignation of Mr. Brown as President of the Society,
it is our pleasure to announce that he will continue to serve the
cause with his counsel and presence as a member of our Advisory
Board.

Also that Mr. John P. Haines was thereupon unanimously
elected President of the Society, Vice James M. Brown resigned.

Since Mr. Haines’ election he has devoted most of his time to
the duties of his ofﬁce, and has thoroughly reorganized and sys-
tematized the affairs of the Society, and under his supervision
the headquarters have been enlarged and repaired, and an ambu-
lance house built, and extensive alterations and changes have
been made in the ofﬁces of the Society, to which we invite your

SUPERINTENDENT’S REPORT.

In submitting this the Twenty-fourth Annual Report of the
general work accomplished during the past year, it must not be
assumed that every detail of duty 0r every ofﬁcial act has been
embodied. To do so would take up more space than can well
be accorded.

It is gratifying, however, to report that instances of wanton
abuse of animals are not so frequent as heretofore, and the penal-
ties inﬂicted upon offenders, and the vigilance of the Society,
have undoubtedly brought about that result.

Cruelty has now to be followed to be detected, and to discover
offenders. requires greater watchfulness on the part of those Whose
province it is to enforce the laws. ‘

The following, however, will, in a condensed form, show the
character and magnitude of the work.

INSPECTION OF STABLES.

The several car and other stables have been ofﬁcially visited
from time to time by our ofﬁcers, and while many horses were
condemned as being unﬁt for railroad service, the majority were
found to be in excellent condition. There'are many so-called
stables, however, in the city, which ought to be condemned, not
only from a sanitary point of View, but for the absence of proper
and adequate means of escape in case of ﬁre. It should not be
allowed to stable horses in'wooden buildings, built in the rear of
tenements, the entrance to which from the street is through a
narrow passageway. There are many subterranean stables in the
city in which from ﬁve to twenty horses are lodged, and are only
kept in proper condition by reason of the constant surveillance

exercised over them by our ofﬁcers.

Cow—sheds in this and adjacent counties have been inspected,
and several persons prosecuted and convicted for feeding cows
12

on swill, and keeping the animals in crowded and unhealhty
barns.

POULTRY.

It has been necessary to keep up a persistent warfare against
shippers and consignees of live poultry. Many thousands of
these animals arrivevweekly in this city from Western States, in
coops and crates inadequate in size to accommodate the living
freight. On their arrival here, our ofﬁcers insist that food, water,
and ample space be at once provided, and thus in a measure
mitigate their suffering pending ﬁnal disposition.

CANALS.

Two experienced ofﬁcers were detailed from headquarters,
who, in conjunction with the local agents of the Society, resident
along the line of the several canals of the State, thoroughly policed
the towpaths.

They suspended from labor many horses and mules found
working, and suffering from bleeding wounds on the breasts and
shoulders, unprotected from the harness. Several boat-captains
and their drivers were prosecuted for permitting the animals to
be worked in the condition described, and were convicted and
ﬁned for the offence.

DOG-POUND.

The city dog-pound has been visited by our ofﬁcer every week,
and every thing has been done for the care and comfort of the
unfortunate animals proscribed by city ordinance, and awaiting
death, which latter, owing to the Society’s recommendation as to
the mode, is a most merciful one. Several of the dog-catchers
have been convicted and ﬁned for cruelly treating the animals
while engaged in their capture.

DOG- AND COCK-FIGH'I‘ING.

These brutal so-called sports are still indulged in, but only in
places where it is most difﬁcult for our. ofﬁcers to approach with«

  
   
  
  
 
    
  
  
  
 
 
   
   
  
   
   
   
  
  
 
 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

 

and severely punished during the past year for the offence, a1-

 

  

I4

out being discovered. Several dog- and cock-ﬁghting dens, how-
ever, have been raided during the past year, and over a hundred
persons found participating in the brutal orgies arrested, convicted,
and ﬁned.

The animals and all the paraphernalia captured were forfeited
to the Society. The proprietors of the places were likewise
prosecuted, convicted, and punished for permitting their premises
to be used for unlawful purposes.

SHIPMENT OF LIVE-STOCK.

The exportation of cattle, sheep, and other animals to foreign
countries has assumed large proportions during the past few years.
Vessels of all descriptions are in demand to transport the stock,
and but for the presence of the Society’s ofﬁcer on board at the
time of shipment, much cruelty, no doubt, would be inflicted upon
the animals by the cattle-drovers. The absence of clubs and
steel-pointed sticks, formerly used to prod and beat the animals,
is evidence of what is being done in that direction. The quality
and quantity of food and water provided for the stock during the
voyage is thoroughly examined, and every thing is insisted upon
which will add to the comfort of the animals while in transit, but
there is no doubt that when the vessel gets outside of the juris-
diction of the State the poor creatures are subjected to neglect
and abuse.

POISONING ANIMALS.

The cowardly offence of dropping small pieces of meat or bread
impregnated with poison, with the intent that it should be eaten
by a neighbor’s pet cat or dog, out of revenge or for some fancied
wrong, has given the Society much trouble. Many animals have
thus been subjected to prolonged suffering and death. Detection
and conviction is seldom possible in such case's, owing to the fact
of the law requiring positive proof of actually seeing the placing
of the poisoned food “ with the intent that it shall be taken by an
animal.”

Several persons, however, have been prosecuted, convicted,

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

    

I5

though, in one instance, it took several weeks to secure the
necessary evidence.

President Haines has offered a reward of $25.00 for information
that will lead to the arrest and conviction of any person guilty of
the offence described, and has caused posters to be distributed
throughout the State, calling attention to the matter.

RABBIT-BAITING.

Pursuant to instructions from President Haines, the under-
signed, with six of the Society’s ofﬁcers, went to Hicksville,
Queens County, Long Island, on December 7th last, and there.
arrested two of the principals engaged in the so-called sport of
rabbit-baiting. To enumerate all the cruel details incidental to
the chasing and killing of rabbits by dogs in an enclosed ﬁeld
would doubtless shock the sensibilities of all right-thinking people.
It will sufﬁce to state that the rabbits are captured and brought
from some Western State to a Long Island farm, and there kept
in bondage until it pleases the members of the club, to whom the
animals are sold, to drive them out one at a time into the ﬁeld
described, where they are chased by dogs until caught and killed.

This manly (P) pastime was criticised by a farmer’s daughter
who was present at the last bait in the following outspoken lan-
guage: “They (alluding to the clubmen) call themselves men!
I ’d like to see them all spanked I ” The prisoners were arraigned
before the local magistrate, and charged with violating certain of
the provisions of section 655 of the Penal Code, viz., “ instigating
and furthering acts of cruelty to animals.” One of the defend-
ants demanded immediate trial by jury, and well-known local
counsel was employed by the club to defend him. The Society’s
prosecuting ofﬁcer presented the case clearly from a legal stand-
point, and showed the mutilated body of the rabbit as evidence
of the character of the “sport.” The jury remained out some
time, but ﬁnally rendered a verdict of not guilty. The other
defendant was tried at night-time before the same Justice and a
jury with the same result.

Elated by the verdicts, another bait was indulged in by the
same club and at the same place. The slipper of the dogs was

 

 

 

 

 
  
 

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   




 

 

 

 

 

 

16

promptly arrested by the Society’s ofﬁcer, who, to the surprise of
those present, suddenly put in an appearance on the ﬁeld. The
prisoner likewise demanded a trial by jury, and was acquitted.
Representative citizens of Long Island, however, condemn the
foreign innovation under the name of coursing, and characterize it

as a brutal pastime.

OTHER WORK.

Ofﬁcers of the Society have attended exhibitions, theatres, and
other places Where animals are employed or used in performances
with the View of preventing their improper treatment or abuse.

The cruel practice of snaring and trapping song-birds is still
carried on in deﬁance of the special laws enacted for their pro-
tection. Our ofﬁcers have, on several occasions, while patrolling
the outlying districts, seized and destroyed the paraphernalia
used for the purpose, which is usually set up in vacant lots,
adjacent to parks or private grounds.

The horses and mules employed on the new aqueduct have
been looked after, likewise those working underground. The
animals were found, in the main, to be in good condition. A
number, however, were suspended from labor, owing to physical
disability, and several humanely destroyed, being found past fur-

ther use.
NIGHT WORK.

Although our uniformed force is limited as to number, ofﬁcers
have been detailed to patrol the streets through the night. They
have visited markets, ferries, depots, hack-stands, and other
places in their ofﬁcial capacity, and much good has been accom-
plished thereby. '

AGENTS.

Many local agents of the Society, resident throughout the State
report that While they have not found it necessary to prosecute
persons for abusing animals, the knowledge that they have the
authority to do so is a menace to the cruelly inclined.

BROOKLYN.
The Brooklyn department of our work has been most efﬁcient
in the discharge of the manifold duties requiring attention.

jan. 2. Davis Felton, for twisting, or what is known as “ locking ” the wings

of poultry, then throwing the animals in a violent manner to the

stone ﬂoor. This offence took place in the building designated by
the Board of Health for the purpose of killing poultry. It is neces-
sary to keep one of our ofﬁcers constantly in attendance there, to
prevent abuse of the animals. Fined ten dollars. Court Special

April 16, 18, 19. Patrick Looney, .227 E. 64th Street ; Patrick Holohan, 1071

First Ave.; James Lawler, 566 Lexington Ave., for dog-ﬁghting.
This offence took place in Bloomingdale Bros’. stables, E. 64th
Street. One of the dogs died a few days after being captured by our
ofﬁcers from the terrible wounds received while ﬁghting. Two of the
defendants elected to be tried by jury. They were indicted, and,
when called for trial before Judge Martine in the Court of General
Sessions, requested that their cases be sent to the Court of Special
Sessions for trial, presided over by Judges Smith, Kilbreth, and Pat—
terson. Lawler pleaded guilty, but Looney went to trial, which
resulted in his conviction. The surviving dog was forfeited to the
Society, and is now enjoying the beneﬁts of a good home, and is the
pet of his new master. Fined one hundred dollars each by Court of
Special Sessions.

April I8. Thos. Welsh, abusing a team of mules. This defendant was drunk

at the time, and insisted on his right to do as he pleased with “my
OWn property.” Fined ten dollars by Judge Walsh.

April 22. John Ennis, for biting the ear of a dog! The animal, a ﬁne St.

Bernard, the pet and playfellow of the children, and general favorite,
was sleeping on the floor of his master’s saloon, when Ennis, in a
half-drunken condition, entered. Accustomed to being petted and
stroked by the patrons of the place, the dog remained still when
Ennis approached and stooped as if to pat its head, but instead of do~
ing so, he seized one of the ears in his teeth, and before any one could
interfere, bit it off. The dog, instead of springing at his cowardly
assailant, walked over towhere his master stood. At the sight of his
mutilated favorite, the ﬁrst impulse was to take the law into his own.
hands. Wiser counsel prevailed, however, and the case was reported to
the Society. The brutal offender was promptly arrested. He de—
manded trial by jury, was COnvicted, and sentenced to the penitentiary
for one year, and to pay a ﬁne of ﬁve hundred dollars, and to stand
committed until the ﬁne shall be paid, by Judge Massey.

Patrick Cochrane, overloading a horse, which at the time was lame
and suffering in its body and limbs. Fined ten dollars by Judge
Powers. 1

Matt. Cunningham, driving a horse attached to a loaded express
wagon while lame, sore, weak, and feeble. Fined ten dollars by
Court of Special Sessions.

Theo. Horstmann, throwing poisoned meat into his next-door
neighbor’s yard, which was eaten by two dogs, causing their death.
The reason assigned for poisoning the animals was that they were
annoying. The dogs were small Skye terriers, and never annoyed
any one. Fined one hundred dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

John Devlin, beating a horse with an iron car-hook. The defendant
was a driver on the Belt Road, and while on his up trip the horse got
one of his forefeet outside of the trace chain. Devlin, instead of get-
ting off the car and adjusting the trace, attempted to do so from the
platform, which he failed to do. Finally, becoming angry, he got
down and struck the animal several savage blows with his car-hook,
cutting the ﬂesh and laming the horse. Fined twenty-ﬁve dollars by
Court of Special Sessions. I

interfere and attempt a rescue, Fined twentynﬁve dollars by Court of
Special Sessions.

Nicholas Richter, cruelly beating a horse on the head and body with
a whip. The horse was somewhat balky, and Richter, losing his tem—
per, struck it several blows on the head, which made matters worse.
He then beat the animal most cruelly on the body, when he was
arrested. Fined ten dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

Jacob Goldsmith, working horse while in a weak and feeble condi-
tion. The animal was attached to a truck, heavily loaded with
furniture. Fined ten dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

This dog-ﬁght took place in an underground apartment of a liquor
saloon. The above—named offenders were seated on boards arranged
in amphitheatre form around the pit, in which the dogs were ﬁercely
ﬁghting. Not a sound was heard but the heavy breathing of the
struggling animals. The silence was rudely broken, however, by a
crash, the only door leading to the den fell in, and to the consterna-
tion of the assembled rufﬁans a squad of ofﬁcers entered. The entire
gang, with the dogs and implements pertaining to the ﬁght, were
seized and taken to the station—house. All of the offenders were
convicted and ﬁned as above by Judge Kavanagh. The dogs and
other property were forfeited to the Society, pursuant to statute.

James Crowley, for permitting the above—mentioned dog—ﬁght to
take place on his premises. Fined ﬁfty dollars by Judge Kavanagh.

Zeinich Eichler, thrusting two ﬁngers in the eye of a steer about
to be slaughtered. This cruel practice was indulged in to a great
extent by butchers’ assistants some time ago, but, owing to the vigi—
lance of our ofﬁcers, is almost entirely suppressed. It is done in
order to get the animal’s head in better position for execution. Fined
ten dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

Paul Dintle, of Staten Island, for unjustiﬁably beating a horse with
a piece of two-inch board. Fined ten dollars by Judge Casey.

they imagined themselves safe from intrusion. Suddenly doors and
Windows were broken down, and, to the consternation of the brutal

Leopold \Vertheim, pushing four calves from his truck to the side-
walk, calves falling on their backs. At the suggestion of the Society,
the owners of live-stock—carrying vehicles provided cleated boards for
unloading the animals on their arrival at the slaughter-houses. In
the absence of our ofﬁcers, drivers of the trucks invariably omit to use
the plank, thinking it too much trouble, and throw the animals out of
the vehicle like bundles of wood. This practice is rarely indulged in
now. Fined ten dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

ing them on stone floor—a cruel practice which some men seem to

dead. Fined ten, twenty, thirty, and forty dollars, respectively, by
Judge Waring.

Aug. 23. Conrad Weiss, stoning chickens and breaking their legs. The
defendant amused himself by throwing stones at the poultry of a

attention, enabling it to conduct its business more systematically
than heretofore.

Also the election as members of the Executive Committee, Mr.
Frederic R. Coudert and the Hon. William Waldorf Astor.

Forty-three names have been added to the yearly and life
membership rolls of the Society, during the past year.

It is the painful duty of your Committee to report the demise
of one of their honored associates, the late Nathan M. Beckwith,
who was for many years and at the time of his death, a Vice-
President of the Society.

Also that of Mrs. Ellen M. Gifford, a life member and earnest
co-worker in the cause.

Likewise the decease of Mrs. E. 'l‘. Hicks, of old Westbury,
Long Island, also a life member and ardent sympathizer with all
organizations engaged in the work of protecting the weak and
helpless.

In addition to the above, several others of our associates have
passed away from the sphere of their usefulness, whose names
will be found inscribed on the obituary records of the Society.

Several new Societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals
have been organized during the past year throughout the State,
pursuant to the act passed by the Legislature of 1888, and are in
active co-operation with the parent institution.

Laws similar to our own have been enacted by the Dominican
Republic of South America, and a Society formed there for the
enforcement of the humane laws. An electro of your ofﬁcial
seal and emblem has been presented to the Organization, and its
members have been welcomed to our merciful brotherhood.

Several new drinking fountains have been erected in the upper
districts, thus supplying a need of long standing.

We desire to gratefully acknowledge the continued kindness of
the Safe Deposit Company of New York in giving to the Society,
free of rent, the use of a large safe in their vaults.

In conclusion your Committee submits, that nothing has been
left undone to carry out the object of the Society, and extend the
work for which it'was called into being. ,

GEO. G. DEWITT, Jr.,
Secrez‘ary.

George Shuttleworth, for striking a horse on the head with an iron
shovel. “Ilost my temper,” was the excuse. Fined ﬁve dollars.

Court Special Sessions.

Wm. Berkley (driver), leading a crippled mule through the streets.
Fined ten dollars by Judge Massey. Went to jail in default of ﬁne.

Patrick McCarthy (0Wner), causing and procuring the above-named
offence to be committed. Fined ten dollars by Judge Massey.

Thos. McCormac, setting dogs to ﬁght on the public highway. The
offender was requested by a lady to cease urging the dogs to ﬁght,
but he replied insolently, and encouraged them on the more. While
so engaged, he was arrested by one of the Society’s ofﬁcers. Realizing
his danger, he commenced to cry for mercy, and even appealed to the
lady he had insulted. Sentenced to serve ﬁve days in jail by Judge

Kenna.

F. D. Harris, for cruelly beating a horse. The offender made use
of a black—snake whip, and the horse’s body was covered with ridges
from the effect of the blows. Fined ten dollars by Judge Massey.

Alfred Wood, carrying live poultry by the legs, with the head hang—
ing down. It is a practice indulged in by pedlars, but owing to the
vigilance of our ofﬁcers is of very rare occurrence. Fined ten dollars.
Court of Special Sessions.

John Jenkins, beating a horse on the body with an iron rod, simply
because the horse became frightened at a passing object, and shied
. a little. Fined twenty-ﬁve dollars by Judge Kenna. Went to jail in
default.

John Barth, Chas. Watson, Jos. Burnham, Benj. Carpenter, Thos.
Lewis, James Anderson, John Brown, engaging in, as witnesses to, a
cock-ﬁght, at Flushing, L. I. About I'O o’clock on the night of
Feb. 22d last, a crowd of rufﬁans were assembled in a roadside hotel
at Flushing, Long Island, to witness a cock-ﬁght. Every thing being
in readiness, the so—called sport began, but was suddenly interrupted
by the breaking down of doors and windows, and the entrance of a
squad of the Society’s ofﬁcers. There were at least a hundred against
twelve, hence it will be seen why so few were captured. The distance
to court was long, and through a lonely wood, and with the prisoners,
pit, and birds seized at the time, the ofﬁcers had their hands full.
Fined ﬁfteen dollars each by Justice McKenna.

Wm. Hill, for permitting above-named cock-ﬁght to take place on
his premises. Fined ﬁfteen dollars by Judge McDonald.

 

 




26

Sept. 21. Charles McDonnell, working a horse while sore, weak, and ex-
hausted. Fined ten dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

Sept. 24. Harry W'illiams, beating a lame and crippled horse. The poor
creature was too weak to drag the loaded truck to which it was
attached, and the offender had recourse to an unjustiﬁable use of the

whip. Fined ﬁve dollars by Judge Kenna.

Michael Lissaute, cutting ”a cat’s ears with a razor. The com-
plainant in this case and the defendant were rival barbers, and while
the animal—which belonged to the former—was playing on the side-
walk, the defendant coaxed it into his shop and cut its ears. The
little creature was found covered with blood, and suffering great pain.
The wound was dressed by the Society’s ofﬁcer, and the offender
arrested. Fined ten dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

James Carroll, beating horse with butt-end of whip. Fined ﬁve dol-
lars by Court of Special Sessions. '

Chas. Schyole, cutting a cat’s ears with a knife, simply because the
animal went into a rear shop where the defendant was engaged cut-
ting up meat, he being a butcher. He did not deny the act, saying:
“ I only done it for fun!” Fined ten dollars by Court of Special

Sessions.

Peter Barker, beating horse over the head with butt-end of cowhide.

The defendant’s excuse, when arrested, was : “ The horse was balky.”

M described. Fined ﬁve dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

blood. This offender offered no excuse for his cruelty, in fact, he had
none to make. Fined ﬁve dollars by Court of Special Sessions.

Herman Vaupelt and James Devans, shooting and wounding a pet
cat belonging to a neighbor. Fined ten dollars each by Judge Casey.

old nag any longer,” the offender took off the harness and left the poor
creature to its fate. Fined ﬁfteen dollars or ﬁfteen days in the County
Jail by Judge Thayer.

 

 

 

Martin Farrell, abandoning a sick horse to die. The case was one
of unusual cruelty. The animal had been sick for some time, and
