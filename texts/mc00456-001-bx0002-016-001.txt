Childbirth Mortality

V

When I crossed the Atlantic in January, 1929,
and met Dr. Simon Flexner, Director of the Rocke’
feller Institute of New York, in debate before an
assembly of 2,500 women, there was much talk of
the marvellous saving of the lives of mothers and
newly/born children through vivisection. The New
York City Federation of Women’s Clubs heard
me denounce vivisection as morally wrong; and
scientiﬁcally worthless. I drew the attention of
that formidable concourse of “ club/women
to the notorious failure of vivisection to bring
health to humanity, as was shown by the
increased mortality’ from cancer, by the prevalence
of inﬂuenZa epidemics and by the terrible
toll of childbirth and of child mortality. A number
of the women showed plainly that in their View
“ science " could do no wrong.

53

Dr. Simon Flexner, who, in the words of a report
of the Debate which appeared in this journal, faced
his audience with a gentle and almost sweet smile,
assured the ladies that dogs experimented on at
the Rockefeller Institute suifered no more pain in
vivisection than the ladies would suffer while under,
going a surgical operation under deep anaesthesia.
Dr. Simon Flexner laid special stress—he was
speaking to women—on the beneﬁts which had
fallen to child’bearing women as a result of vivi'
section of dogs. Through such experiments, drugs
ensuring painless parturition had been discovered,

3

 

 




 

he said. His audience were led to feel that immense
saving of life had been the result of experiments
at the Rockefeller Institute. The women were
visibly impressed.

Since that day there has been a crescendo—in
America and elsewhere—of experiments on animals
in relation to questions of birth and sex. If I
publish the records of a number of these experi’
ments—sickening, cruel and idiotic—some of my
readers will probably write and protest against
“indecency.” The “ indecency ” of permitting
these things to continue without protest does not
trouble the friends who are “ shocked at references
to such experiments.

Practical Results

To return to Dr. Flexner's statements and to the
prevention of deaths in childbirth. The New York
Times, in its issue of November 20th, 193 3, published
a startling article, from which I quote the following 5‘

“ Nearly 66 per cent of the mothers who died
in childbirth in New York City in the years 1930,
1931 and 19 32 could have been saved by the appli’
cation of proper medical knowledge, and 61.1 per
cent. of these avoidable deaths must be directly
charged to the medical profession, it is stated in a
290rpage report on ‘ Maternal Mortality in New
York City,’ made public today by the New York
Academy of Medicine.

“ The report, published by the Commonwealth
Fund, represents a three/year study of ‘ all puer’
peral deaths ’ in New York City, by a sub’

4

 

 

 




committee of the Committee on Public Health
Relations of the Academy of Medicine. The study

was directed by Dr. Ransom S. Hooker.

“ Other members of the subcommittee were
Dr. Frederic E. Sondern, chairman; Dr. Benjamin
P. Watson and Dr. Philip Van Ingen. The study
was conducted with the aid of a grant from the
Cominonwealth Fund.

“ Deaths associated with childbirth, it is stated by
the Academy, are proportionately more numerous
in the United States than in most countries of
comparable rank. The sub’committee was organized
by the Academy in 1930 ‘ to determine the factors
that are responsible for this condition.’

1,343 Preventable Deaths

“In the three years embraced by the study 2,041
maternal deaths occurred in New York City, the
report states. Of this number the committee
estimates 1,343, or 65 .8 per cent., to have been
preventable ‘ if the care of the woman had been
proper in all respects.’

“The committee devoted its major attention to the
preventable deaths and, by a careful review of
every death that occurred, the Academy states,
‘ established to the extent possible the factor or
factors which were responsible for the fatality.’

 

 

 

“ Responsibility for the occurrence of the 1,343
deaths the committee adjudged preventable was
distributed among physicians, patients and midwives.

“ To the medical group 61.1 per cent. of the pre’
ventable deaths are charged. The patient is held
responsible for 36.7 per cent., and the midwives for
only 2.2 per cent. '

 

 

 

 




 

“Among the various factors aﬂecting maternal
mortality, the report cites the widespread use “of
anaesthesia, the decline in spontaneous deliveries, the
greater frequency with which operative measures
are employed, Ccesarean sections, hospital and home
deliveries, prenatal care, economic status and other
important items.*

“ ‘ Sixty per cent. of all the deaths,’ the report
states, ‘ which could have been avoided have been
brought about by some incapacity in the attendant:
lack of judgment, lack of skill, or careless inattention
to the demands in the case. Some of these situations
have arisen out of the fact that internes have been
given too wide a ﬁeld of independent activity.
Most are plainly the results of incompetence.’

“ More than one/third of the preventable deaths are
charged to the patient, as the result of the failure to
take advantage of those facilities which are at hand
for safeguarding her in her pregnancy and delivery.”

I ask my readers to reﬂect for a few moments on
the tendency of vivisectional Medicine to disregard
everything simple and natural, to extol everything
complicated and artiﬁcial. The use of anaesthetics
——twilight sleep—drugzinduced semirconsciousness—
are not “ all beneﬁt ” to the child’bearing woman
and to the child. The article continues :—

“ ‘ The wide effects of the increased use of
anaesthesia,” the report states, ‘ can only be guessed
at, but the direct effect of the administration of the
anaesthetic, in its tendency to lessen and enfeeble
the expulsive powers must be reﬂected in an in’
creased necessity for artiﬁcial assistance in delivery.
The frequent use of instrumentation is based upon
the easy accessibility of anaesthesia.’ ”

Operative Interference

Operations! Are we not invited every day in
the sensational Press to bend knee in reverent
admiration of new operative technique, new “ sur’
gical triumphs,” new instruments, new extirpations?
The reckless advocates of surgery everywhere and at

all times have, it appears, forgotten that Nature made
no provision for interference by knife, suture, and
tube in the co’ordination of the organs of the living
body, and that Nature—on the whole—shows small
tolerance towards such interferences. In regard to
“ operative delivery ” of children the article states:—

“ According to authoritative estimates, it is pointed
out, not more than 5' per cent. of all delivery cases
require Operative interference. Yet a study of the

records of sixtyrseven hospitals in which almost 7‘)”
per cent. of all hospital deliveries occur, shows that

operative interference is practised in 24.3 per cent.
of the cases.

“ In the city as a whole it is estimated that one out
of every ﬁve deliveries is an operative delivery. In
comparing the maternal deaths in operative delivery
with those in which delivery was spontaneous, the
committee found that the maternal mortality was
ﬁve times as high among the operative deliveries as
among the spontaneous ones.*

665

It is not contended,” the report says, ‘ that the
rates can be made equal : the necessity for Operative
interference arises, at times, out of serious abnorr
malities or disturbance of the mechanism of labour,
which, in themselves, greatly increase the hazards.
But any such disparity as that shown in these ﬁgures .
is a certain indictment of those undertaking the
interference.’ ”

 




 

Home better than Hospital

Curious, is it not, that home should prove better
than hospital? Imagine the splendid wards, the
spotless tables, the “ disinfecting ” smell, the 1001
accessories of modern hygienic nursing, and—yet—
I read :—

“ A little less than 30 per cent. of all deliveries
studied during the three’year period took place in
the home. During the same period but 14.5’ per
cent. of the 1,343 preventable deaths followed
delivery in the home, the report states. The relative
deathrrates per 1,000 live births for hospital and
home deliveries are, therefore, 4.5 per 1,000 live
births in the hospital, and only 1.9 per 1,000 live
births in the home.

“ ‘ The maternal mortality rate for home deliveries
is, therefore, substantially less than half of that in
the hospital deliveries,’ the Academy points out.*
It should be remembered, however, that only those
deliveries which are unassociated with serious abnor’
malities are usually undertaken in the home.

“ But even with that in mind, ‘ the great increase
in the hospitalization of the normal parturient has
failed to bring the hOped’fOI’ reduction in maternal
morbidity and mortality, and this in spite of the
great advances in our knowledge of the processes
involved and the proper way of treating them.’ ”

Reinstating the Midwife

I have always felt—no doubt in an old/fashioned
and “ unscientiﬁc " manner—~that the proper person
to, delivermtvgman is woman, just as I feel that'the

 

* Italics mine.

 




 

proper person to feed a newly’born child is its’
human mother and not a bovine fosterrmother. My
prejudices in regard to male attendance at child»
birth have not been removed by the records of the
brilliant laboratory’trained doctors who now becloud
a perfectly natural event with innumerable
experimental theories. I am interested to ﬁnd that
the report has a good word—qualiﬁed—to say for
the midwife :—

“ When judged on the basis of their obstetrical
results, the record of midwifery deliveries, com’
pared to deliveries by physicians, the committee
found ‘ that there is no great disparity between the
results of the work done by the two groups.’

“ ‘ Contrary to the generally accepted opinion,’
the committee states, ‘ the midwife is an acceptable
attendant for properly selected cases of labour and
delivery. There has never been a contention that
she has any place except for the normal delivery
at the home, but we have seen that her results are
as good as those obtained by the physician under
what are justly regarded as comparable
circumstances and for comparable cases.’ "

Out of New York’s 863 licensed midwives the
committee interviewed 5 9, amongst which 20 were
found incompetent.

Amongst a number of recommendations made
are those of better training for midwives, more
schools for them, and careful selection of types of
women suited to the work.

“ The relative safety of delivery at home should
be emphasized. Effort should be made to induce
women who cannot! obtain adequate, medical or

9

 




 

 

hospital care to avail themselves of the services of
qualiﬁed midwives under the supervision of
physicians.”

Disciplinary Action Against an
Editor

The New York Times—by no means a supporter
of those methods of medical refOrm which are
associated with constructive anti’vivisection—gives
vent to its .astonishment in a leading article
published the same day. After informing us that
the Chicago Medical Society had—the week before
-——demanded disciplinary action against the Editor
of the American Medical Association journal, the
New York Times wrote:—

A committee of the New York Medical Academy
has just made a report of nearly 300 pages, as the
result of a three years’ study of “maternal mortality “
in this city. It states that 60 per cent. of all deaths
which could have been avoided “ have been brought
about by some incapacity in the attendant." To be
more speciﬁc: of the 2,041 “maternal deaths " in this
three’year period, 1,343 were adjudged by the com’
mittee as preventable, and of that number 61.1 per
cent. were charged to the medical group, 36.7 per cent.
to the patients and 2.2 per cent. to the midwife. As
to the ﬁrst, the shocking statement is made that “most
are plainly the results of incompetence." It is also
the opinion of the committee that the use of anaesthesia
is a problem of “most pressing importance,” its easy
accessibility leading to the too frequent use of instru'
mentation—with a steady increase in the proportion of
operative deliveries.

The most surprising part of the report is that the
relative death/rate per thousand live births is 4.5 per
thousand in the hospital and 1.9 per thousand in the
home. But it is not forgotten that only deliveries
unassociated with abnormalities are usually undertaken
in the home. Serious cases are likely to be referred or

10

 




 

transferred to the hospital. But what is most disturbing
is that the great increase in hospitalization even in normal
cases has failed to bring the hopedvfor reduction in
puerperal morbidity or mortality. Of special interest is the
recommendation that effort should be made to induce
women who cannot obtain adequate medical or hospital
care “ to avail themselves of the services of qualiﬁed
midwives under the supervision of physicians.” For the
hospitals speciﬁc suggestions are made which cannot be
ignored without blameworthiness.

The death’rate from causes associated with child
bearing is higher in the United States than in most other
countries with which comparison may reasonably be made
and is only slightly lower in New York than in the
country as a whole.. It is higher than can be justiﬁed in
View of the developments of modern knowledge.

The above is a useful summary, and I trust Dr.
Simon Flexner will study the reason why the death’
rate from causes associated with childbearing is
higher in. the, United States than in most other
countries before he delivers another velvety and
soothing address to the women of America.

And now :1 will tell you why the Chicago
Medical Society demanded punishment for the
Editor of the American Medical Association journal.

The Editor had written and published an article
in which he pointed out that:

L

‘in the days of midwives and buggy
“ doctors mothers got on fairly well and
” in some instances better than present!
” clay mothers.”

That, my friends, is dangerous and subversive
teaching in these days of the enthronement of
“ Scientiﬁc Medicine ” on a foundation of riches
drawn from a gullible public.
