iSUPREME COURT JUS—
TICE Abe Fortas gave a
new dimension to kindness
to animals yesterday when
he presented the Albert.
Schweitzer Award of the

Animal Welfare institute to
two US. Senators, Warren
G. Magnuson (D—Wash.) and
A. S. Mike Monroney (l)-
Okla).

The two senators were
‘honored at a ceremony at.
the Georgetown home of
Mr. and Mrs. Roger Stevens
for their work in obtaining
the enactment of Public
Law 89-544. This law is de-
signed to prevent the theft.
of animals for sale to labor—
atories for experimental
purposes and requires hu—
mane care and treatment of
research animals.

“It is ”WE’a‘iise of
ilization that is served by
the humane treatment of
animals,” said Justice For—
tas.

“An essential ingredient
of civilization is society‘s
care for all life, not for just.
a part of it.

“To brutalize life in any
“orm is to invite brutality
on all levels. Respect for
.ife in all forms induces
‘are, kindness and compas-
ion. It raises civilization to
: higher level.”

Justice Fortas, who won
he Schweitzer Award him-
elf last year, praised the
iew law “not only as a mon-

ment to spiritual progress,
)ut as a boon to the quality
f science.”

SEN. MAGNUSON, after
eceiving his medal, told of

civ-

his recent trip behind the
Iron Curtain during which
he and Mrs. Magnuson
didn't see a single dog.r or
eat on the streets of Sofia.
They started asking: why.

“We. discovered that dogs
are not. allowed in Bulga-
ria." said. Sen. Magnuson.
“They say pets have no
value in social life.”

The anti-dog attitude in
Bulgaria is implemented by
such a high dog tax that no—
body can afford man's best
friend.

“Maybe
wrong

that’s what is

with the Commu—
nists," said Sen. Magnuson
to the large audience that
filled two drawingrooms
and overflowed .into the
sun-drenched garden.

He said that there was

the same absence of pets in
Moscow.

SEN. MONRONEY prom-
ised his audience that the
new law is just the begin-
ning of what will be done to
protect the animals that are
used to advance the science
to increase man’s health.

He underscored the big
boost to better laws gi\«’ei'1
by Sen. Maurine Neuberger
(D-Ore.) who was present.
and by the hostess for the
afternoon. Christine Stevens
and her husband who
take such a personal inter-
est in animal welfare as
well as in the arts. Stevens
is Special Assistant to Pres-
ident Johnson for the Arts.

FOR RELEASE OCTOBER 10, 1966 ANm-aL WELFARE INSTITUTE
BOX 3492, GRAND CENTRAL STATION
NEW YORK, N.Y. 10017

TEL: 212-BU8-456H or 202-FE7—5h14

'Washington, D.C. - Senator Warren G. Magnuson (D., Wash.) and
Senator A.S. Mike Monroney (d., Okla.) will receive the annual Albert Schweitzer
Award of the.Animal Welfare Institute, October 11, 1966 in washington, D.C.
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,.Abe'Fortas, will present the awards in
recognition of the outstanding humane achievement of the two Senators in
obtaining enactment of P.L. 89-5hh to prevent theft of pets for sale to labora-
tories and to require humane care and housing of research animals by scientific
institutions and the dealers who supply them.

Senator Monroney is author of the Monroney Amendment included in the new'
law after a hard fight. The amendment requires humane treatment of animals by
laboratories as well as dealers. Senator Magnuson, Chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, sponsored the first Senate bill on the subject, and it, too, included
laboratories in its humane requirements. Laboratory animal welfare bills had been
pending in other committees for six.years without action. The two Senators broke
the impasse. This landmark legislation to protect research animals passed the
Senate by a roll-call vote of 85 to 0 and was signed by President Johnson on August
24th.

Dr..Albert Schweitzer, who received a gold replica of the first medal, was

personally interested in prevention Of cruelty to laboratory animals, and he said

that legislation passed on this subject in the United States would have important

meaning for the world.

Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who was chief Senate sponsor of the
Federal Humane Slaughter.Act of 1958, is an ﬁlbert Schweitzer Medallist, as is

Justice Fortas, author of the first bill for humane treatment of experimental

(MORE)

 




animals, and the late Rachel Carson, author of “Silent Spring.“-Governor.ﬁdlai E.
Stevenson presented the Schweitzer Award address for 1960 when the medallists
were Chief Fundikira, President, and Isobel Slater, Founder, of the Tanganyika
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

The.Anima1 Welfare Institute has presented the award annually since 1955 as
follows: to Dr. Robert Bay for humane management of a colony of 500 beagles used
for radiation studies (1955); to Major C;W} Hume, Founder of the Universities
Federation for.Animal'Welfare of Great Britain, for humane reforms in trapping
and for advancement of laboratory animal welfare (1956); to Paul Kearney, author
of the first published article in a national magazine on the need for legislation
to protect experimental animals (1957); to Vice President Humphrey (1958); to
Rep. W.R. Poage (D., Texas) author and chief House sponsor of the Federal Humane
Slaughter.Act (1959); Chief Fundikira and Mrs. Slater (1960); to William Carr for

his crusading columns on animal welfare in The New York Post (1961); to Rachel

Carson (1962); to Ann Free for her successful fight for decent quarters for the

Food and Drug Administration test beagles (1963); to Patrolman John.Mob1ey for
uncovering bad conditions at Wayne State University which led to their correction

by the State Health Commissioner (196h); to Justice Fortas (1965).
