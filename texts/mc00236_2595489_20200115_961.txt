THE SHE BERR NQKES IN HID—NINTER

She makes and rises to fluff

the leaves with her claws.

Her black eyes stroke

the blackness of her den.

She sees nothing, smell nothing.
She hears nothing, fears nothing.
Takes a turn on the ieaves

and settles to sleep.

Her cubs yawn
put a foot against her.
ey s

Their black e stroke

the blackness of her womb.

They see nothing, smell nothing.
They hear nothing, fear nothing.
Take a turn and settle to sleep.

Uutside, snow is falling silently
the way her milk will soon be
coming down. . . .

 




Social Centimeters

One measures much
by high walls
long since set.

Stones topped with
glass warn in
Cointreau chips, or
champagne edges.

Concrete-block fences
announce nouveau riche
or American tourists
pinching penny winters.

A swift lizard
slipped over a wall,
pursued by a

hungry cat.

The lizard basked
secure within;

the cat stayed

out through respect.

 




Someone Has Got to Love the Animals

W.C. Fields can love Mae West

and milk—sotted mothers the babies, someone's got to
tolerate upchucks and inviolate loveliness

as no doubt my own progenitor

did, and keeping in mind

some say those who over—love the animals

are missing some necessary part with people,

I still say someone's

got to love the dogs,

bthe otters and mongooses,

goats, ferrets, long—lashed cows,

and the sexual horses,

the sad elephants, the veal calves
bolted to their individual tiny barns
for weeks fed only milk,

and the gorilla I had a serious
sobering view of at The National Zoo.

God didn't parcel things out

even. To us he gave a brain -—

an ugly thing, all wrinkled

gray and gelatinous,

like the lives it enables us to waste,

and to the plants he gave infinities of green

but to the animals he gave

love, what we can know

or make of it -— and don't interrupt me here
with Darwin or cat fights or food chains ——
he did give love°

I've a kitten in my pocket right now,
nursing on my bathrobe sash.

Alone here in the rain,

covered with slow noticeable hours,

often there are weeks

I write and read alone.

Into these slashes in the jungle

the animals come -— they peer around a door,
they curl into my crook of elbow,

the V of my knees when I sleep.

 




They come for love and yes they know it -—
even the birds -— I know one hummingbird
high in the Colorado Rockies

who lights in my friend's red

hair for love and nothing more.

 




To CHRIST OUR LORD —« V

The legs of the elk punctured the snow’s crust

And wolves ﬂoated lightfooted on the land

Hunting Christmas elk living and frozen.

Indoors snow melted in a basin and a woman basted
A bird spread over coals by its wings and head.

Snow had sealed the windows; candles lit
The Christmas meal. The special grace chilled
The cooked bird, being long-winded and the room cold.
During the words a boy thought, is it ﬁtting
To eat this creature killed on the wing?

For he had shot it himself, climbing out
Alone on snowshoes in the Christmas dawn,
The fallen snow swirling and the snowfall gone,

Heard its throat. scream as the riﬂe shouted, ~
Watched it drop, and ﬁshed from the snow the dead.

He had not wanted to shoot. The sound

Of wings beating into the hushed morning
Had stirred his love, and the things

In his gloves froze, and he wondered, V
Even famishing, could he ﬁre? Then he ﬁred.

Now the grace praised his vvi k d '
The bird on the" plate 0 e 3th At Its end

Stared at his stricken appetite.
There had been nothing to do but surrender, _
To lull and to eat; he ate as he had killed, with wonder.

At night on snowshoes on the drifting ﬁeld

He wondered again, for whom had love stirred?

The stars glittered on the snow and nothing answered
Then the Swan spread her Wings, cross of the cold nort'ﬁ, '
The pattern and mirror of the acts of earth.

 




UNDER HARSH LIGHT

gut as for you, most odious:;
would_Blake call you holy:

~—Roethke, "Slug"t

on the white wall, under harsh light,
slugs arrange themselves like apostrophes
and questionmarks: they are slick and dark
and silent as miniature whales

They plunge through a time-surf; twined

like threads on a screw: coiled and cool

but appearing hot as twinned candles

melting down to wax, dripping and congealing

at once From under their seeking mouths
beams of pale light enter the world we
breathe in: tails of comets or corposants?
egg tubes or lasers? Everything is still

but them - They move through their dance
needing no masks or drums but, knowing all
the steps, continue to the end To live
like them!

night-engendered, cool as rock to light
the sky like a soothsayer's comet! to crawl.
towards the unimaginable . . . and make it back!

 




Winter Hummingbird

Winter dawn, the earth still

under a shroud frost.

The mulberry leaves have yellowed and fallen;

bare branches click-clack in the wind like bones.
The birdbath water —-

sea to countless wrigglers and swimmers

rippling surface quickened by the slightest breeze —
locked now in block of ice hard as rock.

Elena is dying, the breath crushed out of her
by a tumor in her cheSt; "

the crab's great claw clamps tighter, tighter
round her heart. k

There she is, high up in the pines

a flash bf brilliant green, now here, now there,
wings beating quicker than sight,

heart quicker than sound

hovering, swerving, cutting through space

sure as a bullet .».

she rockets, finally straight up into the sky
(Look at me, anyone brave enough to want me or fight
dives straight back down, fearless,

to alight with a peep and a flutter

on her favorite branch.

She perches a few seconds,

wings aquiver, beak cocked up, defiant and alert,
a weightless, self-consuming blur

of desire and passion and motion

a tiny ingot pulsing with sun—fire.

Hummingbird, be near us in winter!

Hover over us, 0 tiny warm one,

thaw the terrible ice that grips our hearts!

0 lighter than air, fastest of heart and wing,
Quicken our clotted blood,

rid us of this dreadful weight!

Remind us, 0 nectar—sipper,

that life, short life, is sweet.

WITH THE CARIBOU

At the top of the world I want to go for a drive

in a primitive troika lightly harnessed to reindeer.
Behind three clove-brown creatures, yoked together
yet bridleless, guided only by a long pole

that the driver taps to indicate gee and haw

I want to sled over the alpine tundra

race through boreal- forests of birch and aspen

' and glide past the boggy taiga daggered with black spruce trees.

I want to leap up at the three-nation caribou parley

in Whitehorse, Yukon, to warn them the radionuclides
absorbed from the lichen they live on may kill them

if they don't drown in droves at crossings ﬂooded

out by hydroelectric stations, or slowly

starve to death behind oil pipelines that posit
behavioral barriers they dare not soar over

or burst their aortas trying. I want to advise the species
to set up new herds, to mingle and multiply,

else how can I hurtle with them across the Kobuk River

at Onion Portage, be caught up in the streaming southward.
the harsh crowding of antlers uplifted like thousands

of stump-ﬁngered arms? I’m slithering backward in time to
the Bering land bridge, awash at high tide, I cross over
nibbling down to Nevada, down to New jersey,

I rejoice to be circumpolar, all of us

on all fours obeying the laws of migration.

he drives me to his place
which turns out to be
a ruined plantation

by the Mississippi.

gone all to goldenrod
half the walls missing
hundreds of rooms
exposed to the air
fluted column broken

After Rain

Mahogany hulls of
Glistening firmness,
Water polished,

Oars moving in
Rhythmic penetration
Of distance,
Extended toward the
Wet waved surface.
Sails of green
Weaving in weight
And wind, straight
Upward to balance

A flotilla of

Ants in perfect

Line carrying leaves
Across wet sidewalk.

 




Any Other Pasture

Yesterday, the heat, today
the rain begins. The moles,
busy in their labyrinths,
move mountains.

Our dog wears tight lips
in a wise face.

The tumor had blossomed
overnight. Deeper than

nature's claw, there has

been much cutting and sewing.
The plastic bucket over

her head keeps her from chewing,
like a trapped coyote.

To restore the corrugated flesh
we try comfrey, even, taken

from the woods. The vet's faith,
foolish as our nostrums,

works no better.

One corner of the wound

sighs as she breathes.

Her nose a compass, she moves
like a bent shopping cart.

The bucket keeps her from seeing.
She blunders and trips on old scents.

We know nothing will work.

This is a secret we would like

to keep from ourselves. Our eyes
look for another language.

The rules for any other pasture
seem more reasonable.

The vet's needle
would be an opening gate.

 




At the Reelfoot Slaughter House

The tin walls are suddenly around you
Rising to meet roof beams
At angles that cut and slice

This slant of light

Breaking from their imperfect union.

You are below

Imagining your own white bones and

Pale blue ligaments stretched

Across alabaster ball and socket

In perfect alignment

For the walking

That carries you now

Along the sawdust rows

Between the busy stations

The pools glimmering at your feet

Each step a mesh of frantic piss and sweat

Rising to cuff your ankles.

No need to be afraid
The only sound you hear is food

Slaughter

But you move too swiftly in any case
A slightly awkward lumber

Until at the flung-back double doors
The moans are finally behind you
Rising in the steam of hair

In that other, twilight land

Dark except for thin blades oi light

Cutting from roof to floor

Touching the back of your neck so gently
Like a hand beneath a collar

Tucking a wisp of hair.

Down a dirt road

Lined with pines old as bones

A baby wails in its mother’s arms

Safe and secure from all this alarm

And you think of the silly Virginia woolf
Afraid to let the food touch her lips
Letting her body gnaw itself

You know we must eat

To raise our bulk above the ground.

And so you watch

The dazed bulls in unison led
Down the ramp

By the smell of their own kind

BELLING THE CAT

If only they could tell

that the clinking of this bell
is not a summons to die

or an invitation to prayer.
but a warning to beware.

then you could frolic at will
relieved of the need to kill,
Grandmaster of attack,

knowing they will be back.

on the holy afterbirth?
There were wise men,
beasts to receive him

finally, like them a lamb
slaughtered, hu upon iron hooks.
So we could, f' ally, eat his thighs,
ribs, loins, a d believe he doesn’t

A Daily Prayer for the Poisoned, the Blinded,
the Trapped, the Shocked, the Sacrificed . . .

Anold booksays that Adam named them before
he was cast out, that Noah herded them

into the God—driven ark so they might live.

We ate no flesh in Eden, but afterwards,

when things got hard, we forgot

the peaceful kinship of that ancient kingdom.
As our teeth sank into their flesh

we had to deny them. So we said

they had no souls, no reason, no thumbs,

no speech. We were so different. We made

a chain of things to protect us—-fire, medicine,
our locking houses, many kinds of clothes.

And we renamed them—farm product, fur crop,
renewable resource. Pray that we will see

their faces again in the mirror of creation,

the miracle of animals, their clear eyes

meaning more than profit to our own!

 




 

THE GARDEN

Years ago we owned two cats who hated each other.
When I said we had better give one away

you wouldn’t hear of it— you
were adamant, outraged . . .
relenting only weeks later when it was clear

they were going to tear each other to shreds.

I remember the speech you made:

if it came to that we would give away Sluggo,

our loveable calico,

who could purr his way into anyone’s heart.

For in less tolerant hands, Mphahlele,

our difﬁcult, misanthropic gray

might be abused, or abandoned . . . or worse— whereas
if he lived with us he would be loved always.

& of course you were right,

tho God knows you have paid dearly

for a compassion as absolute

&" unyielding

as the copper sheet of the Mexican sky

rising each morning over that house

high in the hills of Chiapas

that you loved so

with its eleven rooms,

those great hanging bells of datura,

that courtyard, tangle

of wild vines

that you would never let me weed

to begin a garden,

insisting in that quiet way of yours

that every creature

had as much right to live as we had,

& that it was a garden.

GIRAFFE

The offerings of the cliff are meager

and the taste of salt on boulders

whets your mouth into a breeze of spittle,
as your head rounds to the countryside
and advances, each reticulation

a wheat field sown in the heat

of other land.

Only a little farther

water glides in the chalk riverbed.

As you lower your head to drink,

past the shoulders,

down the long corridor of your tenuous,
simple legs,

that great burden of neck

driving your forehooves into the dirt,

it is like the onset of the humility

no one can live without.

JOY TO THE FISHES

I hiked out to the end of Sunset Cliffs
8: climbed the breakwater,

sneakers strung over my shoulder '

& a small collection of zen
poems in my ﬁst.
A minnow

that had sloshed out of someone’s baitbucket,
8: that I came within an inch of stepping on,
convulsed in agony.

Delighted to assist,

I tossed it back into its ocean:

swirling eddies sucked about the rocks,
white pythagorean sailboats

in the middle distance.

Kids raced the surf,

a labrador brought down a frisbee,

8: the sun sank pendulously

over the Paciﬁc shelf.

I shivered 8: descended,

slipping the unopened book

into my pocket

8: walked south

along the southern California coastline——
all the hills of Ocean Beach

glowing

in the rouged light

of midwinter sunset.

Even now

it pleases me to think

that somewhere

in the western coastal waters off America
that minnow is still swimming.

Listening For God

Drifting in and out of sleep
beside the river,

I dream that I expect him.
My'body cleans itself

of the poison of the night.
It is like the river,

moving mindlessly

toward health.

My head steadies,

light grows clearer.

On the sand beneath the willows,
near my tent, my dog

lies peacefully awake.

She is neat

with the neatness of animals,
wasting nothing, ‘
hoarding nothing.

Morning is a perfect comfort

she can breathe in

as easily as air.

Her life seems better than a man's,
for she is Speechless,

she suffers nothing

like the whirling madness

men name language.

Because of her purer kind of silence,
I think she hears him

long before I do.

Yesterday, he might have been

faint birdsong,

far down on the river,

and the day before,

the dim roar

of the jet stream,

ten miles up.

But here, this morning,

near these sloughs of rising light,
I know that I will have him,

know that I will hear him

speak my clearly human tongue.

Suddenly,

behind me in the trees,

clinging to a plunging willow branch,
so green I cannot see him,

he clicks and hums,

this time a katydid,

to warn me.

rrrrrr

 

 




poking around in the vines
dogs in all the rooms

on the stairs

and around the house.

my god I say.

they look up at him

and thousands of tails wag.

I have all the dogs here
that no one wants he says
but I have to keep at it.
every few minutes
somebody throws one away
dumps it along a highway
or in someone elses garden.
its no picnic

being the dogcatcher.

first thing next morning

I arrange for a math tutor.

Sweet love, everything
closes its eyes now to sleep.
The cat
has stretched out
at the foot of your bed
& the little bug
I lays its head

in its arms
8: your jacket
that’s draped on the chair:
every button has fallen asleep,
even the poor torn cuff. . .

& your ﬂute
& your paper boat
8: the candy bar

snug in its wrapper.
Outside,
the evening is closing its eyes.
Even the hill to the dark
woods
has fallen asleep
on its side
in a quilt of blue snow.

 

 




Haisie, Our Cat

Senatorial, she has achivved old 330
deficient in-graee and wisdom.

She squints fatly

into thin air. Featuring,

she reelines befouzthe fire
one hind leg radically aligned
above her ear, and licks

in rhythm with some inner tune

She's always been aloof, disﬁninful.
I'm sure she's hiding lune; wnunds.

my daughter wants her to reform,

become a lap cat.

She bribes Maisie with canned food and cream
and £3.08 to pet her. 30th are ten

but Malsie is too vld to c?aa;e.

She will be cross and stately to the end

and then we'll get a kitten.

Some things we can try to do over, better.

Mexican Mist

On the unsaddled back

Of a sinewy white stallion
Pawing the earth,

Eyes bright with longing
For an expanse

Worthy of those

Tall trim legs,

Sat a ponchoed rider,
Dark, sleepy eyes

Under broad black
Sombrero wide enough to
Shade both parts of

This symmetrical duet.

Stepping as though both
Walked, silence and
Mist holding the

Early morning air
Captive, they came on
Down the valley

Slope, rider hollering to
Hid huts and echoing
Hills, hands on

Hips in readiness,
"Leche, Leche!" The
Still warm morning

Milk had come.

 




A MEMORY

The loneliness

Of my puppy's eyes before
His death,

The longing with which he
Looked at me i

As if he could not

Curl close enough.

I mourn
For he who had little choice
But to spend a lifetime.

With me.

Yet he loved me faithfully,

Unlike, you guessed it,

Most men I've known..

And what do

I care

For scoffers who claim

Such feeling for a companion
Silly and certainly not

Fit for poetry?

 




While they expand on

The nature of

The dark abyss or hellfire
After the grave,

I hope

I'll meet a scampering body
Barking for joy

At the mere sight

Of me, that's as good as

God, isn't it?

And I see.

My subject as death,

A parting from that
With which we have been
Intimate, no matter how
Particular or profound,

Terrible or beloved—-

And then eternal life.

'That wish amounting to,

Or is it a prayer that grows into,
A faith
Such parting need not

Be so.

 




In the Glades

 

Sawgrass prairie, idle nd keen.
Wind drifts over e rything.
Shakes the spider egg'case hung
like a parachut in the coco plum.
Carries an in ct’s wiry song.

Old wind ver the marsh’s face.
Sawgrass nows that music best.

Wind at breathes when herons cry,

when he black anhinga rises.
Alli ator listens. So do I.

 

Paradise Key

Wedged in a small tank of water

at the roadside 200, a five-foot alligator
curves like a busted tire, in so tight

his mouth goes up one hot metal side,
his tail up the other. His eyes open
straight into mine. I am nine.

I can see how bad it feels.

My parents know it’s wrong. Silent,
embarrassed, we all stand there till
Dad politely questions the ticket—man:
"Isn’t that tank too small?” ,
"Nah,” says the gashand who doubles
as zookeeper, ”he likes it that way.”
We climb back into our car and drive away.

Now in the Everglades, the place they call
Paradise Key, a little gator surprises me

as he steps out of the sawgrass

six feet away. He crosses my path,

dragging a few reeds over to the pool

where bluegill swim. He means to go fishing.
Something sly and cheerful bubbles

in his glance, and in me, watching him
watching me from the water. He has his life.
He has plans! That’s what his eyes say.

And suddenly I want to bless the tribe

of alligators and the beauty of horned

and glistening skin. I see the primeval
symmetry of reptiles ﬂoating with their prey
in the Everglades. May they go free

of all I know about the tribe of man.

not lost, where are we going,

you with your ancestors and future

Noose, lerge, long-legged luminous large
nimble visitor,

planned by planets and stars and forests
and clouds,

it was decided that we should fleetingly
have a glimpse

of each other and forests and clouds and rivers
in recognition.

 




 

  
  
  
 
    

Red—Tailed Hawk ‘ Learning to Float in the Mon
(with thanks to Paul She
The great white belly of the bird

is streaked with black, like warvpaint

and behind that fierceness

two rust—red, strong red

tail feathers point down. Do not

look away. This is the season

of visions. The fourvsided rain

sent this spirit guide who stares down,
watching you from the giant pine.

His living solid face demands

that you recall the branching path

that led you to this hour, this place.

Do not turn away. Earth waits

for your hand, the speech of roots

and mosses your tongue makes.

Not every woman is gifted with earthvsong.
Do not forget. The hawk’s beak can pierce
through hollowness and flesh.

And the fierce spirit lives on.

Let your blood merge with the river’s water.
There’s no true power without some dying.
Die in the right way. Make your song strong.

Crouching beside the sunlit
guided by the quiet stream,
I learn the way to go.
Knowing how it bends a goes on

beyond autumn’s leafy rc of reflection,

I bend to learn the ot history of this place,
releasing the creek’s eal name:

Monakessi. Strea that Bends.

Digging under t e city of Bethlehem,
ignoring 300 ears of imported history,

I am calling back
the origina people of this place.

I am call' g the original people

I awe of the stream, the trees, the tribes

f the Lenape before Lord Delaware marked them
with his name, I dig and call:

Minsi, Unami, the wellvgrown, straightalooked
first people move and crouch here

200 years before my ancestors

ever dream of leaving Sweden.

Turning back Bethlehem, I hear the Minsi
chanting, dancing the wolf, their totem.
/ Close to the Monocacy the wolfoclan hunted.

 

 




Strategy

Spanish walls of
Cut Mexican lava
To keep the poor
In steep valleys.

Atop a wall

Parades a lizard

From bright sunlight
To shady invisibility.

He pauses pointedly

On front fingers

Performing push—ups
Demonstrating military might.
