Thirteen states whim the release of impounded W

animals to research facilities: Connecticut, Delaware, [9%9

1
Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New F. I,

Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
West Virginia. Of these, Massachusetts is the only state
which specifically prohibits the sale of pound animals
brought in from other states as well: "No person,
institution, animal dealer, or their authorized agent shall
transport . . . any animal obtained from any municipal or
public pound, public agency, or dog officer . . . into the
commonwealth for purposes of research, experimentation,
testing, instruction or demonstration" (Ch. 140, Sec. 174D,
1983).

Release of impounded animals for research purposes is
required in the District of Columbia, Iowa, Minnesota,
Oklahoma (by pounds only; shelters may release animals for
research), South Dakota, and Utah.

Release of impounded animals for research use is allowed
in Arizona, California, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio,
Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

Recent efforts to repeal Minnesota's law requiring
release of animals from pounds to research facilities have
been unsuccessful. However, a law was enacted in 1987 which
provides for inspections of animal dealers by the MinnesotaJ

Board of Animal Health as well as the U. S. Department of

Agriculture, requires dealers to.post signs informing the
public that they sell animals to laboratories, and opens
dealers' premises to the public to enable pet owners to
search for lost or stolen pets. A fine of $1,000 will be
imposed on any individual selling a dog or cat to a research
facility without the permission of the owner.

The State of Washington enacted a law in 1989 to prevent
pet theft. Research animal dealers who sell stolen dogs or
cats to scientific institutions or who pose as adOpters of
animals responding to "free to good home" classified ads may
now be punished by a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in jail.
Research facilities are required to maintain a file on each
dog and cat, including certification of the animal's origin,
a photograph, and a physical description of the animal,

available for public inspection.

ANIMAL LAW REPORT

 

Volume 2, Number 2

"CHAIRMAN'S MESSAGE"

 

It has been gratifying to hear from many
Animal Protection section members who are
pleased with recent issues of this Report. Our
mailing list has expanded and it is rewarding to
learn that attorneys find the Reporter a useful
resource.

I am pleased to report that the Committee
proposed, and the Executive Council of the Young
Lawyers' Division approved, an important
resolution to protect both animals and the rights
of those who do not wish to exploit them. The
resolution upholds the right of students to refuse
"to engage in vivisection if they hold sincere
beliefs that such practices are immoral. Several
cases of student refusal to vivisect have gained
national attention. I frequently receive calls
from anxious students who fear that their future
professional lives will be jeopardized if they
refuse to participate in vivisection, and have
challenged education programs in my own
institution and elsewhere. I am pleased to say
that in every case where a student was willing to
voice an objection to a program, and steadfastly
refused to compromise sincerely-held ethical
principles, a satisfactory accommodation was
reached. I have been encouraged to learn of other
attorneys' successful defense of students' rights.
and ultimately, of course, of the interests of
animals. I trust that this resolution will both
encourage attorneys to become involved in such
efforts, and encourage educational institutions to
recognize the need for flexibility.

September, 1988

Many thousands of animals suffer
confinement, pain, and death every year in
educational programs. There are ‘sound
educational arguments that dependency on
vivisection in education is unnecessary and
counterproductive. There is convincing evidence
that vivisection is a crude method of training
bio—medical professionals, and the example of
other nations who lead the field of bio-medical
education without practicing vivisection in the
classroom underscores the tragic waste of animal
lives in American education.

Of course, the resolution focuses on the right
of a person not to engage in vivisection, rather
than the right of the animal not to be an
experimental subject. However, until animals are
given a voice under this system of justice, by
affording their defenders "standing" to plead their
case, there will be no change in our
anthropocentric’approach to legal issues involving
animals.

On other fronts, there is much room for
similar creative legal approaches to animal

protection that focus directly on human interests

and only indirectly on animals. For example,
when hunter harassment legislation is attacked, it
focuses on a person's constitutional right to
speak, not on the fact that the protester seeks to
defend the hunted animals. In this way, the
unrecognized interests of animals are indirectly

protected by the legal system.

 

 




We will continue to include cases that
protect animals as part of wider environmental
concerns in recognition of the very creative and
successful approaches of lawyers in defense of the
environment. Attorneys seeking to protect
animals will find interesting models and
frameworks for their own cases.

In this issue, we include an expanded verSion
of the Legislative Update, including a summary of
legislation passed by the 100th Congress on issues
that directly or indirectly have an impact on the
lives of animals. Many legislators have
recognized that there is an active and vocal
constituency of animal defenders. I encourage
everyone to learn about pending federal and state
legislation and to continue lobbying efforts to
gain increased protection for animals and their

LIABILITY FOR ANIMALS

Davis v. Ulin.
523 So.2d (Ala. 1988)

Plaintiff was injured in a fall when running
"away from defendant's dogs who ran up to her,
barking. Summary judgment was granted because
the owner is not liable for such an injury unless
she was aware of the dogs‘ vicious pr0pensities.
Defendant had admitted knowledge that her dogs
chased and barked at passers-by. As there was
some evidence of defendant's knowledge, the trial
court should not have granted summary judgment
for defendant. Reversed and remanded.

Nichols v. Fr£y_.
185 Ga. App. 829, 366 S.E.2d 212 (1988)

Plaintiff sought damages resulting from a

 

collision between his truck and defendant's horse
that had strayed on to the public road. Defendant
introduced an affidavit that he had used ordinary
care in maintaining his fences and the trial court
granted his motion for summary judgment.

The Court of Appeals held that defendant's
explanation of his horse's escape as following a
fight between two horses, who had never fought
before, was opinion and not based on personal
knowledge, the trier of fact could arrive at a
different conclusion from that opinion. As
defendant's opinion was insufficient to negate the

habitats. Attorneys can offer assistance to local
humane organizations in drafting legislation and
ordinances to be brought before state and local
legislative bodies. It is likely that there will be
more legislative success at the state level than in
Congress for the foreseeable future. Again, I
would ask those working on legislation to keep me
apprised of efforts and successes in their home

states.

possibility of his negligence, he had not .met‘ the
burden of showing that there was no genu1ne issue
of material fact and he was not entitled to
summary judgment. Judgment Reversed

Greer v. Ellsworth,
113 Idaho 979, 751 P.2d 675 (1988)

Court of Appeals affirmed that owners of cattle
who had strayed on to a highway were not liable
for injuries sustained when.two vehicles collided
with each other, as the cattle were on "open
range." Under Idaho Code 525-21 18, open range 15
"all uninclosed [sic] lands outside of cities,
villages and herd districts, upon which cattle by
custom, license, lease, or permit, are grazed or
permitted to roam." _

Although the statute frees cattle owners
from liability in a collision between a vehicle and
an animal, the court held that "the statute
logically affords protection to the cattle owners
when the animals cause a highway collis1on 1n

, open range."

Lucas v. Kriska.
168 Ill.App.3d 317, 522 N.E.2d 736 (1988)

 

Plaintiff's mother boarded her horse at
defendant's farm and plaintiff was bitten by a dog
owned by defendant's sister who frequently
brought her dog to the farm when she visited her
own horse there. The dog was never leashed on
the farm and it roamed the farm during the Vis1ts.

 




 

 

The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff, but
by special interrogatory, found that the defendant
was not the owner or keeper of the dog.

The Special finding on ownership precluded
any statutory liability under the Animal Control
Act, and the Court of Appeals considered liability
under common-law negligence. If an owner of
property knows or should have known that
children are frequently present, he must remedy
conditions likely to cause injury to children.
However, plaintiff must still show that defendant
knew of the dog's vicious propensities, as under
Illinois law a dog is presumed to be docile, absent
demonstrated vicious propensities. Plaintiff did
not introduce evidence of defendant's knowledge
of any such prOpensity. Judgment for plaintiff
reversed.

Bertrand v. Berard.
521 So.2d 12611 (La. cr. App.1988)

 

Plaintiff, an elderly nursing-home resident,
died from complications from a hip injury
sustained when she was frightened by a small dog
and fell in the nursing home's parking lot.

The Louisiana Code provides strict liability-

for owners of domestic animals which cause harm
to another person. The defendant had claimed
that the nursing home's behavior was a proximate
cause of plaintiff's injury, in order to exculpate
himself. The court held that a reasonable
standard of care for a nursing home does not
require that an attendant follow all ambulatory
patients.

State v. Dirosa.
520 So.2d 1244 (La. Ct. App. 1988)

 

Jefferson Parish's general noise ordinance
was violated by the continual barking of
defendant's dog. Defendant had argued that he
Should have been charged under the
animal—specific noise ordinance, but the court
held that dog noise ”can properly be included in
the general noise prohibition."

Howard v. Allstate Insurance Co.
520 So.2d 715 (La. 1988)

A child was severely bitten by a German
Shephard dog. Under Louisiana law, an animal's
owner is strictly liable for injuries it causes, but
may exculpate himself from presumed fault by
showing that the victim's fault, a third person, or
a fortuitous event caused the harm.

As the victim was eleven years old, with a
mental age of eight, she was held to a lesser
standard of care in determining comparative fault
when the court considered the nature of each
party's conduct and its causal relation to the
claimed damages.

. Palloni v. Smith,
167 Mich. App.393, 421 N.W. 2d 699 (1988)

 

A child was bitten when he attempted to hug
a dog. In considering the issue of provocation, the
court held that as strict liability is imposed on a
dog's owner, "the defense of provocation must be
construed without concern for fault on the part of
the person committing the provocation." The
court must consider whether the act was
sufficient to provoke the attack, not the intent of
the actor. The child's unintentional act of
provocation can provide a defense for the dog's
owner, and the victim's age is not an impediment
to that defense. The jury's verdict of no cause of
action was not against the weight of the evidence.

Riemer v. Zahn,
420 MW. 2d 659 (Minn. Ct. App. 1988)

The owner of a dog registered it under the
defendant's name so that she could have more
than three dogs in her home, in violation of a
Minneapolis City ordinance. When the dog bit a
child, the victim sued the registered owner, who
responded by denying ownership in a letter.
Plaintiff's attorney informed Zahn that his denial
did not constitute an answer, but Zahn made no
further answer and a default judgment was

entered.

As the injury only left a 1 1/2 inch scar, the
default judgment was for $15,000, and as the
question of ownership of the dog remained, the
court ruled that the judgment should be reopened
and remanded for a determination on the merits.

 

 

 

 

 




 

De Vaul v. Carvigo, No. 37893
138 A.D. 2d 669, 526 N.Y.S. 483 (1988)

Plaintiff was bitten by defendant's German
Shepherd dog. Judgment for defendant affirmed.
Plaintiff did not show that the dog had vicious
propensities and both are. required liability. Court
rejected plaintiffs‘ argument that the trial court
erred in refusing to take judicial notice of the
"supposed fact that German Shepherd dogs are, as
a breed, vicious."

MISCELLANEOUS

 

Friedman v. Hall.
843 F.2d 1391 (6th Cir. 1988)
(Aff‘d without published opinion)

 

Veterinarian sued racing stewards, claiming
that they. had suspended his occupational license
and denied him privileges at Michigan harness
racing tracks, because of his religion. Court
affirmed the su5pension, finding no evidence of
religious bias. The veterinarian was disciplined on
charges that the had injected drugs into horses
before they competed.

The court also affirmed that the racing
stewards were immune from suit because of "their
quasi-judicial function." (id. at 5). The state has a
strong interest in the strict regulation of racing
and stewards must be free from harassment.
Under Michigan law, stewards can subpoena
witnesses and evidence, conduct investigations,
and determine penalties.

Canadian Southern Associates v. Dahl.
(unpublished opinion)

Plaintiffs sued for breach of warranty,
claiming that a horse bought for breeding and
showing was not fit for those purposes, as she was
small and her legs "toed out." Breach of warranty
was not established, as the owners had not
attempted to show or breed her. Plaintiffs
contended that "equity does not require one to do
a useless act", but there was testimony that
breeding with a large stallion could produce an
average-sized foal. The question of her
appearance could only be considered if she had
been shown unsuccessfully, as a determination of
apprOpriate appearance for an Arabian horse
"involves much personal preference on the part of
the person making the evaluation." Affirmed.

Edwin Bender 6: Sons v.
Ericson Livestock Comm'n Co.
228 Neb. 157 l521 N.W. 2d 766 (1988)

Defendant held cattle auction and advertised
cattle as "guaranteed open" (not pregnant).
Pregnant cattle do not make good feeder cattle,
as feed goes to the developing calf and abortion
causes stress and weight loss.

The cattle company did not specifically
indicate that the cattle plaintiff bought were not
pregnant, but an auctioneer represented that they
were not and said that there was an affidavit in
the office.

The district court had held that as plaintiff
received a "Heifer Guarantee Contract", which
offered a 3% price rebate if the cattle were
pregnant, when he paid for the cattle, plaintiff
received what auctioneer said he would. The
Supreme Court reversed and remanded holding
that the auctioneer's "positive assurance and
categorical representation" induced reliance, "not
the auctioneer's mention of some document of
unspecified content". [the affidavit].

CR UELTY TO ANIMALS

 

American Horse Protection Ass'n. v. Lyng,
681 F. Supp. 949 (D.D.C. 1988)

 

Court of Appeals had remanded case
(previously reported, 812 F.2d 1 (D.C. Cir. 1987)),
for the Secretary of the Department of
Agriculture to explain its decision not to institute
a mandatory rulemaking on the practice of
"soring" horses during training of walking horses
to achieve a high-stepping gait.

The Court agreed with plaintiffs allegation
that existing regulations permitting techniques
including the use of chains, padded shoes, and
irritating solutions, violated the Horse Protection
Act. The Court directed the Secretary to
institute rulemaking procedures concerning such
"action devices."

State v. Unyersaw. No. CA87-l l-llt6
(Ct. App. Ohio. March 31, 1988)

 

Defendant appealed from his conviction for
injuring animals. Although the owner of a dog did
not see the defendant shoot the animal, she

 




 

produced sufficient evidence that defendant was
the one who shot the dog. The statue prohibited
killing or injuring a dog "that is the property of
another" The court rejected defendant's
argument that the state did not make a required
showing that the dog was registered showing that
the dog was registered, and thus established as
personal property. Analysis of other statutes
showed that "all dogs are personal property
regardless of their registration status."

State v. Petersen.
Feb. 9, 1988) (unpublished opinion)

 

Conviction for misdemeanor criminal damage
for shooting a dog with a bow and arrow
affirmed. Defendant owned a female dog who
was coming into heat, but had just been Spayed
and defendant's veterinarian had instructed that
she must be kept cool When she was chained
outside at night, defendant saw a male dog
bothering his female dog. When the dog could not
be chased away, defendant killed him. Defendant
raised Minn. Stat.§347.l7 (1986) as a defense,
which permits a person to kill a rabid dog, one
who escapes from its owner's property and
attacks someone, or one who attacks domestic
animals. The court held that the dog that
defendant killed did not come under that statute,
and even if he was trying to protect his dog, he
acted cruelly and did not raise a valid defense to
the charge.

VETERINARY CARE

 

Carter v. Louisiana State Universitl;
520 So.2d 3831La. 1988)

 

Trial court's finding of veterinary
malpractice, resulting in the amputation of a
horse's tail, affirmed. The court found the case
"sui generis, the only‘malpractice claim for a
bob-tailed horse.”

. During treatment for diarrhea, the horse's
t?“ was covered by a protective sleeve, bound too
tightly with adhesive tape by a student under the
veterinarian's supervision, and it developed
gangrene. The horse was a stud animal and the
1035 of his tail affected his value and
performance. As a horse being treated for a
SthaCh disorder does not usually lose his tail
Without negligence, the court employed a res ipsa
lquitor analysis, and the veterinarian did not
exculpate himself.

WILDLIFE

Northwest Coalition for Alternatives
to Pesticides v. LYIE
8##F.2d 588 (9th Cir. 1988)

Environmental and wildlife preservation
groups challenged the adequacy of an
Environmental Impact Statement prepared in
connection with Noxious Weed Control Program.
District Court enjoined the Bureau of Land
Management (BLM) from using herbicides until it
prepared a Worst Case Analysis, pursuant to 40
C.F.R. §l502.22 (1985). BLM is required to
eradicate noxious weeds that threaten native
plants and wildlife, and poison cattle.

The court discusses the adequacy and
procedures of the EIS in a long statement that
should prove useful to other litigants. In
particular, it addresses plaintiff's alternative
approach of addressing the cause of noxious weed
growth, to be resolved by intergrated pest
management and altered growing patterns, with
the use of peSticides only as a last resort.

Although a challenge to an EIS should not be
a challenge to BLM policy, an EIS must include all
possible approaches that would affect the impact
on the environment and a cost-benefit balance.

"An EIS is rendered inadequate by the
existence of a viable but unexamined alternative.
Furthermore, even if an alternative requires
'legislative action', this fact does not
automatically justify excluding it from an EIS." A
reasoned choice requires access to the full range
of alternatives.

Court of Appeals held that BLM's action
were not arbitrary or capricious and, although
plaintiffs raised valid environmental concerns,
BLM is entitled to be "arguably wrong."

In re: Forfeiture of 1984 Ford Van 150,
521 So. 2d 21:4(F1a. Dist. Ct. App. 1988)

Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission appealed an order denying forfeiture
of property belonging to a person who was
convicted of taking a deer out of season,
sentenced 20 days in jail, fined 13500, and lost
hunting privileges for 3 years.

 

 




 

The Trial court in the forfeiture proceeding
had granted a petition for forfeiture of the gun
used to shoot the deer, but held that seizure of
the van would be an abuse of discretion as was
'incidental' to the crime.

The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that
§372.990l Florida Statutes made forfeiture
mandatory, because of the repeated use of "shall" A
in the statute.

EXPERIMENTATION

Eli Lilly 6c Co. v. Medtronic Inc.,
No. 83-5393 (U.S. Dist. Ct. for ED.
Pa, April 21,‘ 1988) 7 U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA)
[#47

 

Discussing claim of patent infringement of a
catheter/dispersive electrode device, the court
heard extensive evidence of defibrillation
experiments on 200 dogs.

Medtronic failed to show that Lilly's patents
where unenforceable because of alleged
unequitable conduct on the part of their inventors
in failing to disclose prior art to the Patent 6c
Trademark Office.

Nineteenth Century Laboratory Animal
Protective Pr0posals Rebuffed

    
        
   
 
   
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  

In 1880, a bill to regulate animal experimentation in the
District of Columbia was introduced in Congress. Its
provisions were roughly similar to the British Cruelty to
V/ Animals Act of 1876 which has provided substantial protection
for experimental animals for more than a century with the
j* approval of the British scientific community. But American
scientists who were asked for their Opinions Opposed and

easily defeated this initial effort.

/// Between 1828 and 1898,nearly every state and territory in
the Union passed an anti-cruelty statutéf* Fourteen of these
laws exempted animal experiments. Even the crusading Henry

Bergh, an outspoken anti—vivisectionist, agreed to the

 

V

exemption of experimental animals when he revised/fhe New

York anti—cruelty law in 1867.

No prosecutions for cruelty to laboratory animals are
known during this period in states without such exemptions.
Not until the latter half of the twentieth century
(Massachusetts in 1958 and Maryland in 1982) were anti—
cruelty laws invoked on behalf of laboratory animals. In the
first case, the Massachusetts SPCA successfully prosecuted a
research scientist and animal caretaker for cruelty in
maintaining and transporting post-Surgical dogs outside the

institution (the Overholt Clinic).

 

V/ ,2,* Arizona and Alaska passed anti—cruelty laws in 1913.

    
 

\/ 32/




  
    
   
   
   
   
    
 

In Maryland Dr. Edward Taub was found guilty of 17

    

counts of cruelty to experimental monkeys at the Institute
for Behavioral Research. On appeal, the judgement was
reversed on grounds that the Maryland law was superseded by

the Federal Animal Welfare Act.

Legislative Activity in the Post-Second World War Period

Virtually all bills relating to laboratory animals from

1945 to 1960 were inspired by the National Society for

    
  

Medical Research or one of its affiliates. Founded in

   
  
   

Chicago in 1945 by Dr. A.J. Carlson, Dr. Andrew C. Ivy and

     

Dr. George Wakerlin, the NSMR devoted most of its efforts to

   
    
   
    
 
   
       
   
  

enactment Of state laws requiring both humane society
shelters and public pounds to surrender dogs and cats on

request from scientific institutions for use in any type of

  

experiments or tests, no matter how painful and prolonged.

The first forced surrender law was passed in Minnesota in
1948. HUmane societies were unaware that the bill had even

been introduced before it had gone through both Houses and

   
         
         
   
 

been signed by the Governor. This law required release of
impounded animals from humane society shelters that receive
funds from taxes, as well as from municipal pounds. In 1949
in Wisconsin, an even more severe seizure law was passed,
requiring any stray animal to be made available on request to
a scientific institution. Thus, shelters Operated wholly by
charitable funds were also compelled to supply animals for

experiments, regardless of the degree and duration of pain

   




and suffering inflicted. An attempt was made to pass similar
legislation in Illinois, but here the attempt failed, and the
individual communities were left in control of local policies
with reSpect to disposition of stray dogs and cats.
Procurement laws passed in New York, South Dakota,
Oklahoma, Connecticut, Ohio, and Iowa did not attempt to

enact such far-reaching legislation.

Robert Sellar, the PreSident of the American Humane
Associationr saw the grave danger to the We movement,
whose organizational structure in the late 1940's was
especially susceptible to demoralization through animal
seizure legislation. Virtually all the well-established
humane societies centered their work around shelters for lost
or unwanted dogs and cats. If forced to surrender animals

for painful experiments, the entire structure would lose its

moral basis as a sanctuary for animals where they would be

: 3 .
m a, ,y
. . ,J . .
\ ' , .7 . ,; g ... -. is 1‘ w. a
r , 4 1’ g ‘ . \ V M

safe from inflicted suffering.

Mr. Sellar sought to reason with the National Society for
Medical Research in hOpes of finding a solution to the demand
for research dogs without undermining the morals of the
humane movement. A_small AHA group met with an NSMR group
with the understanding that the preliminary talk would not be
publicized. But Mr. Ralph Rohweder, the Executive Secretary
of the NSMR, immediately sent out an announcement calculated
to inflame anti-vivisection societies and anti-Vivisectionist

members of the American Humane Association. Mr. Sellar

 




lacked the power to resolve the crisis manufactured by the
NSMR and henceforth, battles raged in state after state to
pass legislation compelling humane societies to surrender
dogs and cats to the laboratories on demand and without

controls on pain infliction.

With the death of Robert Sellar came the end of real
attempts to face the problem and solve it. The influence of
professional humanitarians - the paid employees of large
societies who had a vested interest in the continuance of
their jobs - was not conducive to firm resolve. They felt
that they must avoid offending either anti-vivisectionists,
from whom their organizations might receive large gifts and
bequests, or scientific and medical groups, whoseginfluence
'they feared. Thus it was that the American Humane
Association, normally eager for contributions,declined an
offered gift of $10,000 to study and prepare a concerted plan
for obtaining humane treatment of research animals and a

solution to the problem of supply to laboratories.

a?
of the Eatignal Humane Review, Fred Myers, a newspaper man

Before his death Mr. Sellar had appointed a new director

who was a reformer and an effective writer. He attahked the

NSMR for its policies of indiscriminate procurement and use

of animals. So telling were his arguments that he was

‘3 g»:
forbidden by AHA management,

‘hekihéaViiy weighted against any
energetic action, to use the words "National Society for

Medical Research" in any article published in the national

 




I Humane Review. Emwilling to submit to such an arbitrary
stifling of truthful reporting, Mr. Myers resigned, together
with two of the other three major staff members: Helen
Jones, Director of Education, and Larry Andrews, Director of

Field Services. All were appointees of Robert Sellar, who

Léjff had been replaced after his death by Mel Morse.
/

The National Humane Society was founded by the dissident
trio. The American Humane Association promptly sued them
to force them to change the society's name, which, it
claimed, was too similar to National Humane Review. The
result was the renaming of the new organization as the Humane

Society of the United States.

Nor was this the only legal action taken in the reform
effort. The first attempt to change the passive attitude of
the AHA came at the election of directors at the 1954 annual
meeting. The three reform candidates, Professor Roland Smith
of the Department of English, University of Illinois, Miss
J.M. Perry, an attorney from South Carolina, and Mr. Raymond
Naramore, a high school teacher who became the director of
the Rochester and Monroe county Humane Society, were promptly
elected by a delighted membership that had never before

exercised its prerogatives. The controlling group of AHA

 

Lf* Mr. Morse, who fought the reform efforts of the founders of
the Humane Society of the United States as chief executive of
the American Humane Association, became president of the
Humane Society of the United States from 1967 - 1970.

 




J/

/

directors was dismayed. The following year they fought back,
first naming a meeting point in the Northwest where the
expense of travel would discourage the bulk of the
membership, concentrated in the East, from attending. Forced
by injunction to name a more central location for the
meeting, they resorted to bringing in large numbers of
persons never before associated with animal welfare work who
voted as a bloc on signal. The "in" group won and put a
final end to reform of the AHA. Miss Perry died, Professor
Smith resigned, and Mr. Naramore was limited by the other
Adirectors to work on humane education for schools until he,

too, died.

Due to the failure of these and other efforts to bring

purpose and life into the AHA establishment, several new

organizations were formed. The Animal Welfare Institute was

\-
///’ founded in 1951. Its aim is the advancement of the welfare

of all animals, with special emphasis on the research
animals, which had so long been neglected by humane
organizations. Its charter was drawn by Herbert Brownell,
the distinguished New York lawyer who served as Attorney

General under President Eisenhower.

The Humane Society of the United States was founded in
1954; and in 1959 One of its founders, Helen Jones, left the

parent body to found the National Catholic Society for Animal

Welfare, later renamed the International Society for Animal

Rights.

 




   

        

In 1952, after years of controversy, the Hatch-Metcalf

   

Act was passed. The Act amended an existing New York

Both the Erie County Humane Society and the Humane
Society of Rochester and Monroe County immediately gave up

their pound contracts so that it would not be necessary for

 

them to release animals from their shelters to laboratories.
Only two organizations, the ASPCA and the Syracuse SPCA,
continued to accept tax funds and were thus required to send
dogs and cats to scientific institutions. Between 1966 and
1974 when the Hatch-Metcalf Act was repealed, the Syracuse
SPCA delivered 14,000 dogs and cats to Bristol-Myers, a

company with annual sales of more than a billion dollars.

Regulatory Fraposals stalled in Committee
by Medical Lobbyists

Between the years 1960 and 1966, a great deal of effort
was devoted to unsuccessful attempts to pass legislation
based on the principles of the British Act of 1876.* The
first bill ever introduced in the United States Congress to
regulate animal experimentation was sponsored by Senators
John Sherman CooPer, Mike Mansfield, E.L. Bartlett, Robert C.
Byrd, Frank Church, Estes Kefauver, Wayne Morse, William
Proxmire, Jennings Randolph, Ernest Gruening, Pat McNamara,
Harrison Williams, and Joseph S. Clark. The bill was
written by Abe Fortas and introduced at the request of the
Society for Animal Protective Legislation. As soon as this
bill was introduced, the National Anti—Vivisection Society
and National Society for Medical Research, normally at each

other's throats, found themselves in agreement: there must

be no regulation of animal experimentation. When hearings

were held two years later in the Reuse of Representatives,
Major Charles Hume, founder of the Universities Federation
for Animal Welfare of Great Britain, emphasized the fact
that, poles apart though they were, these two groups actually
corresponded with a View to helping each other defeat

regulatory legislation.

Opponents thought they had buried regulatory
legislation, and in that Committee they had. But they
reckoned without the disappearance of a Dalmatian dog named

Pepper and the response of the House Agriculture Committee.

The Humane Society of the United States, under the
direction of Fred Myers, insisted that the British Act was

i;
not sufficiently strong; and the Society asked Kepresentative

Moulder to introduce a decidedly restrictive bill. 'Ehe

American Humane Association remained silent and, when
pressed, said it was studying the matter. When Congressman
Kenneth Roberts held two days of hearings on the Griffiths
and Moulder bills, the AHA sent no one to testify.*

Medical research groups and anti-Vivisection groups
Opposed the bills; the National Catholic Society for Animal
Welfare said it would support the Moulder bill if it were
amended to eliminate all pain infliction. Significant
statements were made by scientists and medical men who
supported the Griffiths bill (identical to the Clark-
Neuberger bill in the Senate) based on the principles of the
British Act, and also by knowledgeable Britons who had worked
under the Act and could testify from firsthand experience as
to its workability and effectiveness in preventing animal

suffering without hampering research.

 

e American Humane Association was also absent when
hearings were called by Congressman Poage on the Resnick
bill, September 2, 1965. At subsequent hearings their
representatives testified against inclusion of laboratories
in the bill.

 




The American Medical Association felt differently,

however, and editorialized about what it termed "humaniaciﬂﬁ

An objective and authoritative voice was heard from England
when the Report of the Departmental Committee on Experiments
on Animals was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of

State for the Home Department, April, 1965.

The Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney
Littlewood, held hearings over a two—year period to review
the working of the British Act, giving every individual and
group who desired to be heard an Opportunity. The resulting
"Littlewood Report," a remarkable testimony to fairness and
good judgment, surveying every aspect of animal
experimentation, of the treatment of the animals, and of
procurement, reported the views of scientists, of the public,
and of groups as diverse as the Universities Federation for
Animal Welfare,‘ whose scientific approach is well known, and
anti-vivisection organizations, who would abolish all
experimentation on animals. The most widely quoted paragraph
in the 255-page Report is the first of the General Findings:
"Animal experiment is a complex and highly specialised
subject. It is also a moral and social problem of the first
magnitude and one that does not exclusively concern the
expert.”

./‘

,1" 1" ,‘

C;£/*For example, Nobel laureate, Sir Peter Medawar, was Chairman
of UENN'S Scientific Advisory Committee. He repeatedly sent
statements on the value of the British Act for quotation at
Congressional hearings.

 

 




The "Littlewood Report" was referred to repeatedly by two

distinguished medical men who flew to the United States to
testify at hearings held September 30, 1965, before the House
Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee: Dr. Lawrence
Abel, former Vice President of the Royal College of Surgeons
of England and Consulting Surgeon to the Institute of Cancer
Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, and Sir Graham Wilson,

former Director of the Public Health Service.

Speaking of the inspectorate under the British Act, Sir
Graham said: "The Act is administered by the Home Office and
is enforced by Specially appointed inspectors possessing a
medical or veterinary qualification. Their main purpose is
regulatory and educational rather than disciplinary. In
their visits to the laboratories they satisfy themselves
about the suitability of the conditions under which the
animals are kept and of the general well-being of the animals
themselves; they may assure themselves that the license
holder is fully aware of What he is permitted and not
permitted to do; and they make useful suggestions for

overcoming difficulties of one sort or another.“

Dr. Abel, Speaking of the three principles - licensing,
inspection, and the pain rule - said: "The third British
Principle is the Pain Rule. This sets the limit to the
amount of suffering which may be inflicted. We do not commit
the atrocities which are reported from time to time in some

other countries. We do not allow the extravagant cruelty

 




Y

 

committed by some investigators of stress and shock. We have

proved that the desired results can be obtained by less
inhumane methods. We are convinced that the freedom of all
and sundry to use animals indiscriminately would not improve

the value of research."

The hearings of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce
Committee at which Sir Graham and Dr. Abel testified were
never published. Scheduled as twowday hearings, they were
abruptly canceled the morning of the second day and never

rescheduled.

New Bill Bypasses the Health Committees

On.July 3, 1965, Fay Brisk, a longwterm campaigner for
reform of the big Pennsylvania dog dealers, called the Animal
Welfare Institute for help to try to get Pepper back to her
owners, the Lakavage family. Mr. Lakavage, in the hospital
with a heart attack, saw Pepper's photograph together with
seventeen other dogs and two goats that had been temporarily
unloaded from a Pennsylvania dog dealer's overcrowded truck.
Mrs. Lakavage and the three young Lakavages set off in
pursuit of Pepper, who, allegedly, had been taken toga big

New York State dog dealer, Nersesian. When the exhausted

, family arrived, Nersesian refused them entry.

Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, long time fighter for

animal protection and chief Sponsor of pending legislation to

require humane treatment of experimental animals, was out of

 




town, but Sara_Ehrmann, his Legislative Assistant, responded
to the AWI call for help by telephoning Congressman Resnick's
office in the District where Nersesian's dog farm was
located. Even Congressional intercession failed, however;
and Resnick, angered by Nersesian's high-handed refusal to
admit the family to find their missing pet, decided he would

introduce a bill to prevent such wrongs.

Meantime, pressure by the State police brought an

o
.a-

admission from the Pennsylvania dog dealer that he had taken
his load not to Nersesian, as he first had said, but directly
to Montefiore Hospital in New York. Immediately, Fay Brisk
telephoned the hospital, could hear the rattling of the dog
tags at the other end of the phone, then the news: the dog
had died on the Operating table the day before and already
had been incinerated. The dog dealer insisted the dog was
not Pepper - the evidence was incinerated - but the call for
female Dalmatians, put out by the hospital to dealers rather
than to breeders, had led to introduction of the Resnick bill
on July ninth. The Resnick bill, written by attorneys of the
United States Department of Agriculture, required that
dealers in dogs and cats and the laboratories that purchased
them be licensed, inspected, and adhere to humane standards
set by the Secretary of Agriculture. A companion bill was
introduced in the Senate by Senator Warren G. Magnuson,
Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Clark,

who came to the Senate floor at the same moment to introduce

identical bills. In a brief colloquy they agreed to co—

 




sponsor, and Senator Daniel Brewster of Maryland joined them.
w.

On September fiftthongressman HiR. Poage of Texas,
Chairman of the Livestgg; Subcommittee of the House
Agriculture Committee, held hearings on the Resnick bill. He
was the first American legislator to hold hearings on
laboratory animal legislation with a view to enacting it. He
had won passage of the Humane Slaughter Act in 1958, and was
destined to win again for laboratory animals. Not easily,
however. The bill was immediately attacked as anti—
vivisectionist by the National Society for Medical Research,
which described it as a "pincers movement" to cut off the
supply of animals for laboratories. Anti-Vivisectionist
groups, however, took but little interest in the matter. The
demand for action came from the general public, outraged by
the article in Liﬁe magazine showing Stan Wayman's

photographs of the shocking abuse of dogs in the dealers'

hands.

The Liﬁg article was set in motion by Henry Luce after he

looked over a collection of photographs supplied by the

Animal Welfare Institute, many of them taken by photographers
accompanying AWI Laboratory Animal Consultant, Dorothy Dyce.
Under the supervision of Liﬁe's Nature Editor, Pat Hunt, the
article was completed and published February 4, 1966. More
mail was received by Lite on this article than on any other
in the history of the magazine, and Congress received more

mail on the pending bills than on civil rights or Vietnam.

 




In the face of such demand, the Opponents began to modify
their Opposition. When Congressman Poage introduced the
Committee bill, extending coverage to all vertebrate animals,
and Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania introduced an
identical bill in the Senate, the Opponents concentrated on
exempting scientific institutions from the humane standards
and on cutting back the number of species covered. The Poage
bill came unscathed through the Subcommittee, but the full
House Agriculture gpmmittee cut it down to dogs and cats in
dealers' premises only. Laboratory interests thus won a
temporary victory and, no doubt, believed they could continue
to keep the objective veterinary inspectors of the 0.5.

Department of Agriculture out of scientific institutions.

After the House passed the weakened version of the Poage
bill, a Senate Commerce committee staff draft accomplished a
comparable weakening of the bills introduced by Senators
Magnuson, Clark, Brewster, and Scott. Again, laboratory
interests made a stab at getting themselves exempted, but
they had reckoned without Senator Monroney, who, as soon as
he read the draft, prepared an amendment restoring coverage
of animals inside scientific institutions. Newspapers
throughout the country supported the Monroney Amendment in

emphatic terms. So hotly debated was the issue that a second

set of hearings was scheduled in the Senate Commerce

Committee on May iét , 1966.

For six years the National Institutes of Health and its

 




parent Department of Health, Education and Welfare had

Opposed all moves toward effective legislation for humane

treatment of research animals. Suddenly, when it became

clear that such Opposition could no longer stem the demand
for action, the NIH asked Senator Lister Hill, Chairman of
the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, to introduce a
bill written by NIH itself providing a self-policing system
for laboratories. Meanwhile, its representatives urged
exemption of laboratories from the straightforward, hwmane

Senate Commerce Committee bill.

 




Neither the Committee nor the Senate as a whole could be

brought to support this maneuver. The Washington Evening
Star stated editorially:

THE ANIMAL CRUELTW’BILLS

Congress at last is headed toward enactment of a
law to require humane treatment of animals used in
laboratory research and to halt thefts of pets by
dealers supplying this market. At the eleventh hour,
however, a snag has been encountered in the Senate

Commerce committee. Medical researchers, hostile to

J /"

government supervision, (but not government grants, it

should be added), are attempting a switch play. A bill
introduced by Senator Hill of Alabama would head off

federal inspection of how laboratories treat animals
awaiting experiments. Instead this authority would be

given to a private group.

The medical men, in fact have such a group all ready
and waiting. Set up last year, it is called the
American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory
Animal Care. Its members are of the establishment; and
are staff members of medical schools and research
institutions. And, as the association's brochure
suggests, the 'inSpections' would be rather friendly

affairs.

 




     
   
  
    
   
 
  
   
   
 
  
  
    
  
   
 
   
  
   
   

There would be no surprise audits, such as those
routinely carried out now in the banking industry, for
example. Instead a visit would be scheduled by 'mutual
convenience.‘ It would not come distressingly often -
no more than once every five years. The inspectors,
according to the brochure, would charge fees ranging

up to $1,000 for their trouble.

If the laboratories are in fact treating their
animals humanely, they should have nothing to fear
from a prOposal by Senator Magnuson of Washington that
such inspections be made by the Department of
AgriCulture after standards have been published. His
bill has nothing to do with the anti-vivisectionists;
the government would not interfere with any laboratory

tests or Operations.

Certainly the public should not be deluded into
thinking the Hill proposal represents any kind of
adequate substitute for impartial inspection of such

institutions.

Senator Magnuson had made plain his determination to
report a bill out of his Committee. The National Society for
Medical Research and National Institutes of Health,
therefore, concentrated on trying to get the laboratories
exempted from compliance with humane standards set by the

United States Department of Agriculture and inspection by its




representatives. Glowing references to the American
Association for Accrediation of Laboratory Animal Care, for
whose existence Dr. Maurice Visscher, President of the NSMR,
took credit, were a stock in trade; and at the final Senate
Commerce Committee hearings, representatives of the NIH and
NSMR strongly supported the NIH bill and Opposed the Monroney
Amendment. Testimony was limited to medical witnesses at
this hearing; and two courageous physicians, who had been
associated for years with efforts to obtain humane treahnent
of laboratory animals, came to Washington to testify for the
Monroney Amendment: Dr. Nicholas Gimbel, Chief of Surgery at
MetrOpolitan Hospital and Associate Professor of Surgery at
Wayne University Medical School, and Dr. Bennett Derby, Head

of Neurology at Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan

and Assistant Professor of Neurology at New York University
Medical School. Dr. Gimbel and Dr. Derby urged the Senate
f<>7ﬁ Epmmittee to provide for humane care and housing of animals
in research institutions. They emphasized that the
Department of Agriculture is the ideal agency to administer
such requirements. Dr. Gimbel, who had devoted considerable
time to getting better treatment for experimental dogs in
different institutions, brought the question down toearth by
stating that if he were a dog, he would prefer to have the
Department of Agriculture administer the law. He said the
"welfare of animals should be the responsibility of a body.

which is primarily interested in them...the Department of

Agriculture," and he added: "If the scientists and

 




organizations represented in AAALAC had done their job
prOperly, we would not be holding hearings here today. The
time has come to bring in independent auditors." The NIH

bill did not come to hearings.

//jg7i The Senate Commerce cpmmittee bill, under the leadership

of Senator Magnuson and Senator Monroney, received unanimous
endorsement by the Senate. Eighty-five Senators came to the
floor to vote for it, and each of the fifteen who were absent

and unable to vote stated in Th§_Congre§§ig§al Record that

VWW

they would have voted for it had they been present. It is

rare, indeed, for a bill to receive such overwhelmingly
favorable action, especially in so controversial a field.

The bill's sanctions were strengthened at the insistence of
the House Conferees. They agreed to accept the Senate
amendments restoring humane care and housing of animals
inside laboratories and increasing the number of species of
animals covered, on condition that the stronger House

enforcement clauses be adopted.

Regulations were promulgated by the Secretary of
Agriculture February 24; and the law went into effect for
animal dealers May 25 and for scientific institutions August

24, 1967.

Congress broadened and strengtheneE/this first federal
law to prevent abuses of test animal§Zjin 1970, 19765and
1985. The 1966 Laboratory Animal Welfare Act (fiercely

contested by medical and pharmaceutical interests and the

 




L277 associated industries that sell animals, cages)and equipment
to scientific institutions) set humane standards for dogs,
cats, primates, rabbits, hamsters, and guinea pigs in animal
dealers' premises and in laboratories prior to experimental
use of animals. In 1970, the coverage was extended to the
entire stay of animals in laboratories where they must be
maintained according to minimum standards set by the
Secretary of Agriculture. The veterinary care required
included "apprOpriate use of anesthetic, analgesic, and

Kflttranquilizing drugs." All warmnblooded animals designated by

27
the Secretary are covered. He has not yet designated birds,

nor those species that constitute the large majority of the

V/A;>’millions of experimental animals used each year+——mice and

rats¢—-An annual apprOpriation of $4,865,000 has had to be
stretched to cover inspections oflaboratories,-licensed

(r animal dealers, licensed exhibitors, registered exhibitors,
‘53:;7End carriers under the act as amended. The Secretary has
' been reluctant to include more animals for inspectors to

check;

The important requirement for pain relieving drugs and
reporting on their use or lack thereof was also added in
1970. Reports by registered scientific institutions on use
of animals are filed.with the Ujg. Department of Agriculture
and are available for public scrutiny under the Freedom of
Information Act. Many institutions have failed to honor this

section of the Act, necessitating additional legislative and

 




/>

enforcement action.

Under the 1976 amendments sponsored by Agriculture
Committee Chairman Thomas Foley, research institutions were
moved to the same category as exhibitors and dealers with
respect to the imposition of fines for violations.
Previously, research facilities were subject to a cease and
desist order which they would have to violate before a fine
could be imposed. The 1976 amendments also include a
requirement that agencies of the federal government submit
proof that they are in compliance with the standards which
private institutions must meet under the eyes of veterinary
inspectors of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal
and Plait Health Inspection Service. Representative Margaret

éi/prOposed and was successful in obtaining this

Heckle

essential advance on the Floor of the House.

The Animal Welfare Act now constitutes a solid broad-

yéj7/ based structure whose 1976 amendments)sponsored in the Senate

/

by Senator Lowell Weicker, cover transportation of animals
for research, exhibition, the pet trade, by common carriers
and intermediate handlers. Its anti—dog and cock-fighting

provisions are detailed in Chapter XI..

The 1970 reporting requirements on painful experiments
focused on the responsibility of the institutional
veterinarian to prevent suffering through humane experimental
design or through use of drugs to relieve pain or anxiety.

However, enforcement in this area has been virtually nil.

Alternatives to Laboratory Animals
As numbers of animals used in experiments and tests grew
by the million, a countervailing phi1050phy was increasingly
advocated by animal protective organizations. The first

serious contribution to the field was The Bringiplgﬁ Qﬁ

x77” ﬂumane W1. Terminus, by W.M.S. Russell and R.L.
92> Burch/produced under the aegis of the Universities Federation

for Animal Welfare in 1959, with some modest assistance from

 

: ("'2
V/// <g:* Secretary of Health and Human ServiCes, 1982-1985.
AWI. This pioneering book established The Three R's:

Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement which are now
generally recoqnized as fundamental elements necessary to
prevent large-scale unnecessary suffering by laboratory
animals. While Russell and Burch stressed the scientifically
feasible, others advocated "Alternatives Now!" claiming that
substitutes for animals already existed for all experiments
and tests. Bills introduced in Congress reflected different
views of the subject but they made up, if not a critical

mass, solid evidence of public concern and hOpe.
By 1981, seven bills on alternatives and/or regulation

of animal experiments were pending in the Subcommittee on
//// Science Research and Technology of the House Committee on

y6§7Science and Technology. On October 13 and le’1981,

Subcommittee Chairman Doug Walgren of Pennsylvania held

because Maryland police had removed 17 monkeys just days
earlier from a Silver Spring laboratory. There they had
been experimented on by Dr. Edward Taub under grants from the
National Institutes of Health. Dr. Taub and an associate
were charged with 17 counts of cruelty for failing to supply
veterinary care. Alex Pacheco, who had worked at the
Institute for Behavioral Research as a volunteer and had
alerted police to conditions there, showed horrifying
pictures of the monkeys and their quarters at the hearings.

Drafting of a composite bill containing some features
. from each of the seven pending prOposals was undertaken by

Vééepthe subcommittee staff. Advice was sought from the many

organizations which had testified pro- or con~ the different
bills. On August 4, 1982, Congressman Walgren prOposed the
new bill, which was approved by his Subcommittee and its
aﬁ’parent cgmmittee. The bill was referred to the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Health and
the Environment, and hearings were held by Chairman Henry

Waxman of California on December 9, 1982.

Senator Robert Dole introduced a bill based on the
principles develOped in the October hearings. Senator John
Meldher of Montana, the Congress' only veterinarian, joined
him. Together, they appeared at the Waxman hearings and
testified for the Walgren bill, an unusual tribute to the

importance of the legislation. However, no action was taken

 




, uvvvrm-MWW

'before the 97th Congress adjourned.

When Senator Dole reintroduced his bill in l§8dyhe had
it redrafted as an amendment to the Animal Welfare Act, thus
broadening its coverage to include all Registered

lg Research Facilities (over eleven hundred) were inspected by

USDA's Veterinary Services.

This wise decision encouraged consideration by scientific
groups who began a slow move from point-blank opposition to
demands for a variety of modifications in the language of the
bill. At hearings of the full Senate Agriculture Committee,
chaired by Senator Dole July 20th, nearly every witness had
scientific qualifications. Humane groups were represented by
Bennett Derby, M.D., Ph.D., who had appeared at the crucial
hearings which led to unanimous Senate passage of the

original Act.

Senator Dole's masterful handling of the hearings paved_
the way for action, but it was not to come in the 98th
Congress. Opponents tried a new tack, questioning the need
for the Dole bill. The Society for Animal Protective

Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. of California, well

known for his successful Sponsorship of the 1978 humane

 




I slaughter amendments (see chapter III), introduced a bill
éj9based on the Dole bill, H.R. 5725. On September 19, 198i7he
p237) chaired hearings in his gpbcommittee on Departmental
Operations, Research and Foreign Agriculture which drew a
standing-room—only crowd with long lines waiting outside the
hearing room. Interest in the legislation had been

heightened by revelations of severe mistreatment of

/}j%’experimental baboons at/yhe University of Pennsylvania

Medical School. Sixty hours of self-incriminating videotapes
taken by a research team as a record of their experiments
showed virtually every rule of aseptic surgery being
violated. Injured baboons were painfully dangled and
ridiculed by groups of laughing students.

The tapes were stolen by a group known as the
Animal Liberation Front and given to People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals. They made a 25—minute version to show
the public. It was run repeatedly in a nearby church on the

day of the hearings.

Henry Mitchell's column in Ihe ﬂashingtgn 293; September
21, 1984 notes: "Savagery is very much part of the nature of
all humans I have ever known, and that is one reason
civilized nations have gone to such efforts to restrain it or
redirect it." Citing the evidence and characterizing it as
sickening, he wrote: "Legislation is needed, and those who do
not wish to concern themselves with what amounts to
flamboyant sadism should at least have the grace not to

obstruct the long hard thankless labors of those who have not

 




shied from the evidence and who have at last come up with

,xi:;rreasonable and moderate legislation.ffﬁescribing his feelings

:??D in watching five minutes of the tapes in St. Mark's Church,
he concluded: "I left thinking it probably an esthetic error

to vomit in a church."

Documentation of neglect and abuse in laboratories
throughout the entire country was derived from official
reports of USDA veterinary inspectors obtained under the
Freedom of Information Act and presented by the Society for
Animal Protective Legislation in the form of a 6'xlO' chart.

A heartening message of support from Dr. Jean Mayer,
President of Tufts University, was delivered by Frank Loew,

Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, but most
testimony from scientific groups was severely critical.
Congressman Brown asked his staff to analyze all the

//%>>criticisms. His bill did not emerge from theﬂgubcommittee.

/

Meantime, in the Health and Environment Subcommittee,
Congressman Walgren had succeeded in getting some provisions
of his bill included in the NIH Reauthorization Bill which
was passed by the Congress but vetoed by President Reagan.

In the 99th Congress, the NIH Reauthorization Bill, after
some modification, was passed again and Congress overrode the
President's second veto. The animal welfare provisions are
less stringent than the Dole-Brown legislation, and they
apply only to NIH grantees; nevertheless, the tWo were

destined to fit together well and reinforce one another in a

 




 

practical manner.

Senator Dole, elected Majority Leader of the Senate,
reintroduced his bill at the same time as Congressman Brown.
This time the bills were identical, the heroic work of
staffers Sara Rasmussen for Brown and Mark Scanlan for Dole.
They produced a final draft still containing every major
animal protective provision, phrased in the manner least
objectionable to the legion of Opponents and unremitting

critics.

bill then went into an intense discussion by the staffs of

é;;roSenators Dole, Hatch/and Melcher and representatives of the

National Association for Biomedical Research, the Feed

AZV'Manufacturers Association and the Society for Animal

)
Protective Legislation. A bill calling for 16 different

changes in Senator Dole's bill had been prepared for Senator.

VE7’ Hatch by anNABR.attorney. Every point had to be fought

through. Senator Dole appeared from time to time to ask what

 




progress was being made. At one point, Senator Melcher took
tggppart in the argumentsjgxplaining the reason for his language,
"a physical environment adequate to promote the
psychological well being of primates." He had seen
laboratory chimpanzee cages which, even though unoccupied at
the time, be characterized as "extremely efficient, extremely

expensive, and extremely cruel."

A second series of amendments, this time consisting of no
less than 32 changes, even including a $500 reduction in the
fine, was proposed. A night meeting in the Dole office
was called to resolve the differences. It appeared that
although academia was somewhat grudgingly resigned to the
legislation, the pharmaceutical industry was not willing to
stop fighting. Indeed, it fought to the end.

Disagreement about the content continued, and Senator Melcher
offered a substitute bill on October 29. This passed the

Senate unanimously.

The House had already passed the Farm Bill without the
Dole-Brown amendments. Fortunately, Majority Whip Tom Foley

of Washington proved himself a powerful friend of animals

w .
,ﬁ%ﬁduring the House-Senate gpnference. Congressman Foley, as

noted earlier, was the author of the 1976 amendments to the
Animal Welfare Act. House Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza of Texas gave his blessing to the
legislation in conference. Lobbying to kill the Improved

)7’Standards for Laboratoryggpimals continued to the very last

 




moment.

The Farm Bill, an enormously lengthy piece of
legislation, was in conference for days. The conferees met
in a small room in the Russell Senate Office Building, and
dozens of lobbyists from each of the Special interests that
stood to gain or lose from some part of the complex bill
lined the hallway outside the room, waiting for news on
decisions of the conferees as staffers came in and out. At

four p.m. on December 12, it appeared that action on the

laboratory animal section was imminent. Weakening amendments

were being urged by the National Association for Biomedical
Research, and Senator Dole had not yet returned from out of

town.

The sight of the Senate Majority Leader striding down
the hall reinvigorated the weary Society for Animal
Protective Legislation lobbyists waiting for the outcome.
"You're next," he said to us. Then he was engulfed by a mass
of farm lobbyists. It was nearly eleven that night when we
heard the good news from Congressman Foley. The Improved
Standards for Laboratory Animals Act had come through the

Conference unscathed!

The Conference report was approved by the House December
16 and two days later by the Senate. The Improved Standards
for Laboratory Animals amendments establish an information
service in the National Agricultural Library in c00peration

with the/national Library of Medicine to provide data on
/ .

 




alternatives to laboratory animals, help prevent unintended
duplication of experiments and tests, and provide information
to institutions for instruction of scientists and other
personnel in humane practices as required by the new law.
kjéthach/gegistered research gacility must appoint an
institutional animal committee including a veterinarian and a
person unaffiliated with it to represent the general
community interests in the prOper care and treatment of
animals. The committee must inspect the animal laboratories
twice a year and report deficiencies to the institution for

.70

L/é?“’correction. If not corrected promptly, the 0/8. Department

of Agriculture must be notified for enforcement action, and
any funding agency involved informed for a decision on

whether the grant should be suspended or revoked.

D/// Investigators are required to consider alternative and

to consult with a veterinarian before beginning any
experiment which could cause pain. They must adhere to
standards set by the Secretary of Agriculture for pre- and
/> post-surgical care, use of pains—rel ieving drugs or
euthanasia, against use of paralytics without anesthesia, and
unnecessary use of the same animal for more than one major
Operation. Exceptions to the standards may be made only when
Specified by a research protocol and an explanation given for
i/ » cany deviation. Fines for violations were raised from $1,00;

(/ to $2,500 and germ $500 to $1,500.

Interest in protection of laboratory animals has grown

 




worldwide, and two countries made significant improvements in
their national laws in 1986: The United Kingdom and the
Federal Republic of Germany. The full text of these laws
appears in the Appendix. Of particular note in the new
British Act is recognition of gradations of stress or pain
and justification thereof. This begins with the stress
caused by putting an animal in a cage and progresses to the
point of procedures prohibited because of extreme

painfulness.

k;:;. In issuing project licensesjthe Secretary of State is

required to "weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals
concerned against the benefit likely-to accrue." Both

project licenses and individual licenses are mandatory under
the new law. As in the 1876 Act, if an inspeCtor considers
€i>>s that an animal is undergoing excessive suffering1he may

require it to be immediately killed.

;//// The new German law was introduced by Minister of
A

griculture Ignaz Kiechle. It forbids use of animals for
ij? tests on weapons, tobacco, washing powders/and cosmetics.
Authorization for experiments are to be supervised by
advisory commissioners. Animal protection organizations may
nominate up to a third of the commissions’ members. The law
covers all experiments leading to pain or injury of an

animal.

Bilh:, I spoke with CS on Saturday, and she asked me to send
thiC t you.

As ou can see, it's a copy of the Animal Welfare Act, as
amended (including the Improved Standards for Laboratory
Animals amendments). We have included this law, in its
entirety, in the Laboratory Animal Welfare chapter of Animals
and Iheir Legal Rights.

With regard to the "NOTE" circled in pencil at the bottom of
this page, CS would like you to call Tom Walsh at OGC to ask
him if this copy of the law is complete and correct.

The chapter has already been sent to Jan, so please return
this to me (you can mail it to me at home so that I'll have
it when I return from Massachusetts) with a note informing me
of Walsh's response and whether any changes have to be made.

Thanks!

ANIMAL WELFARE ACT
As Amended
(7 U.S.C. §§ 2131-2157)

Section 1. (a) This Act may be cited
as the "Animal Welfare Act".

(b) The Congress finds that animals
and activities which are regulated under
this Act are either in interstate or
foreign commerce or substantially affect
such commerce or the free flow thereof,
and that regulation of animals and
activities as provided in this Act is
necessary to prevent and eliminate
burdens upon such commerce and to
effectively regulate such commerce, in
order--

(1) to insure that animals
intended for use in research
facilities or for exhibition
purposes or for use as pets are
provided humane care and
treatment;

(2) to assure the humane
treatment of animals during
transportation in commerce; and

(3) to protect the owners of
animals from the theft of their
animals by preventing the sale or
use of animals which have been
stolen.

The Congress further finds that it is
essential to regulate, as provided in
this Act, the transportation, purchase,
sale, housing, care, handling, and
treatment of animals by carriers or by
persons or organizations engaged in
using them for research or experimental
purposes or for exhibition purposes or
holding them for sale as pets or for any
such purpose or use. The Congress
further finds that-

(l) the use of animals is
instrumental in certain research and
education for advancing knowledge of
cures and treatment for diseases and
injuries which afflict both humans and
animals;

(2) methods of testing that do not
use animals are being and continue to be
deve10ped which are faster, less
expensive, and more accurate than
traditional animal experiments for some

purposes and further Opportunities exist
for the development of these methods of
testing;

(3) measures which eliminate or
minimize the unnecessary duplication of
experiments on animals can result in
more productive use of Federal funds;
and

(4) measures which help meet the
public concern for laboratory animal
care and treatment are important in
assuring that research will continue
to progress.

LAB.1: 4/2/90

Chapter IV

LABORATORY ANIMAL WELFARE
by Christine Stevens

Not until the end of 1985 when Senator Robert Dole attached his bill,
”Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals,” to the Farm Bill by unanimous
consent of Senate and House, did the United States achieve legislation compa-
rable to that already in effect in 14 western European countries1 for protection
of animals used by scientific institutions. The Farm Bill was signed by President
Reagan two days before Christmas, making the Improved Standards provisions
effective December 23, 1986, a year from the date of enactment.2

More than twenty years of intensive work was required to reach the point
at which the'American Physiological Society, major experimentalists, withdrew
its opposition to legislation sought by animal protective organizations. The
Association Of Professors of Medicine, too, accepted the bill’s provisions in the
closing months of the struggle for its passage.

Efforts which began in 1880 to regulate animal experimentation in the
United States are described in detail from 1945 onward.

NINETEENTH CENTURY LABORATORY ANIMAL
PROTECTIVE PROPOSALS REBUFFED

In 1880, a bill to regulate animal experimentation in the District of Colum-
bia was introduced in Congress. Its provisions were roughly similar to the Brit-
ish Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876 which provided substantial protection for
experimental animals for more than a century with the approval of the British
scientific community.3 But American scientists who were asked for their opin-
ions opposed and easily defeated this initial effort.

Between 1828 and 1898, nearly every state and territory in the Union pas-
sed an anti-cruelty statute.4 Fourteen of these laws exempted animal experi-
ments. Even the crusading Henry Bergh, an outSpoken anti-vivisectionist,
agreed to the exemption of experimental animals when he revised the New
York anti-cruelty law in 1867.

No prosecutions for cruelty to laboratory animals are known during this
period in states without such exemptions. Not until the latter half of the twenti-
eth century (Massachusetts in 1958 and Maryland in 1982) were anti-cruelty
laws invoked on behalf of laboratory animals. In the first case, the Massachusetts
SPCA successfully prosecuted a research scientist and animal caretaker for cru-
elty in maintaining and transporting post-surgical dogs outside the institution
(the Overholt Clinic).

In Maryland, Dr. Edward Taub was found guilty of 17 counts of cruelty to
experimental monkeys at the Institute for Behavioral Research. On appeal, the
judgment was reversed on grounds that the Maryland law was superseded by
the federal Animal Welfare Act.

LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE POST-SECOND WORLD WAR PERIOD
Animal Seizure

Virtually all bills relating to laboratory animals from 1945 to 1960 were
inspired by the National Society for Medical Research (NSMR) or one of its
affiliates. Founded in Chicago in 1945 by Dr. A. J. Carlson, Dr. Andrew C. Ivy,
and Dr. George Wakerlin, the NSMR devoted most of its efforts to enactment of
state laws requiring both humane society shelters and public pounds to sur-
render dogs and cats on request from scientific institutions for use in any type of
experiments or tests, no matter how painful and prolonged.

The first forced surrender law was passed in Minnesota in 1948. Humane
societies were unaware that the bill had even been introduced before it had
gone through both Houses and been signed by the Governor. This law required
release of impounded animals from humane society shelters that receive funds
from taxes, as well as from municipal pounds. In 1949 in Wisconsin, an even
more severe seizure law was passed, requiring any stray animal to be made
available on request to a scientific institution. Thus, shelters operated wholly by
charitable funds were also compelled to supply animals for experiments,
regardless of the degree and duration of pain and suffering inﬂicted. An attempt

 




was made to pass similar legislation in Illinois, but here it failed, and the individ-
ual communities were left in control of local policies with respect to disposition
of stray dogs and cats.

Procurement laws passed in New York, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Connect-
icut, Ohio, and Iowa did not attempt to enact such far-reaching legislation.

Robert Sellar, the President of the American Humane Association (AHA),
the national federation of humane societies, saw the grave danger to the move-
ment, whose organizational structure in the late 1940’s was especially suscepti-
ble to demoralization through animal seizure legislation. Virtually all the well-
established humane societies centered their work around shelters for lost or
unwanted dogs and cats. If forced to surrender animals for painful experiments,
the entire structure would lose its moral basis as a sanctuary for animals where
they would be safe from inﬂicted suffering. These were dark days for organized
animal protection.

Mr. Sellar sought to reason with the National Society for Medical Research
in hopes of finding a solution to the demand for research dogs without under-
mining the morals of the humane movement. A small AHA group met with an
NSMR group with the understanding that the preliminary talk would not be
publicized. But Mr. Ralph Rohweder, the Executive Secretary of the NSMR,
immediately sent out an announcement calculated to inﬂame anti-vivisection
societies and anti-vivisectionist members of the American Humane Association.
Mr. Sellar lacked the power to resolve the crisis manufactured by the NSMR,
and henceforth, battles raged in state after state to pass legislation compelling
humane societies to surrender dogs and cats to the laboratories on demand and
without controls on pain infliction.

With the death of Robert Sellar came the end of real efforts to face the prob-
lem and solve it. The inﬂuence of a coterie of professional humanitarians—the
paid employees of large societies who had a vested interest in the continuance
of their jobs———was not conducive to firm resolve. They felt that they must avoid
offending either anti-vivisectionists, from whom their organizations might
. receive large gifts and bequests, or scientific and medical groups, whose power-
ful inﬂuence they feared. Thus it was that the American Humane Association,
normally eager for contributions, declined an offered gift of $10,000 to study
and prepare a concerted plan for obtaining humane treatment of research ani-
mals and a solution to the problem of supply to laboratories.

Before his death, Mr. Sellar had appointed a new director of the National
Humane Review, Fred Myers, a newspaper man who was a reformer and an effec-
tive writer. He attacked the N SMR for its policies of indiscriminate procurement
and use of animals. So telling were his arguments that he was forbidden by
AHA management, which was heavily weighted against any energetic action, to
use the words "National Society for Medical Research” in any article published
in the National Humane Review. Unwilling to submit to such an arbitrary stiﬂing
of truthful reporting, Mr. Myers resigned, together with two of the other three
major staff members: Helen Jones, Director of Education, and Larry Andrews,
Director of Field Services. All were appointees of Robert Sellar, who had been
' replaced after his death by Mel Morse.5

The National Humane Society was founded by the dissident trio. The
American Humane Association promptly sued them to force them to change
the society’s name, which, it claimed, was too similar to National Humane Review.
The result was the renaming of the new organization as the Humane Society of
the United States.

Nor was this the only legal action taken in the reform effort. The first
attempt to change the passive attitude of the AHA came at the election of direc-
tors at the 1954 annual meeting. The three reform candidates, Professor Roland
Smith of the Department of English, University of Illinois, Miss I. M. Perry, an
attorney from South Carolina, and Mr. Raymond Naramore, a high school
teacher who became the director of the Rochester and Monroe County Humane
Society, were promptly elected by a delighted membership that had never
before exercised its prerogatives. The controlling group of AHA directors was
dismayed. The following year they fought back, first naming a meeting point in
the Northwest where the expense of travel would discourage the bulk of the
membership, concentrated in the East, from attending. Forced by injunction to
name a more central location for the meeting, they resorted to bringing in large
numbers of "persons never before associated with animal welfare work who
voted as a bloc on signal. The "in" group won and, not long after, Miss Perry
died, and Professor Smith resigned. Mr. Naramore, limited to work on humane
education for schools, died a few years later.

Due to the failure of these and other attempts to bring purpose and life into
the AHA establishment at that time, several new organizations were formed.
The Animal Welfare Institute was founded in 1951, its aim the advancement of ‘
the welfare of all animals, with special emphasis on the research animals so long

 




neglected by humane organizations. Its charter was drawn by Herbert Brownell,
the distinguished New York lawyer who served as Attorney General under
President Eisenhower.

The Humane Society of the United States was founded 1n 1954; and 1n 1959
one of its founders, Helen Jones, left the parent body to found the National
Catholic Society for Animal Welfare, later renamed the International Society for
Animal Rights.

In 1952, after years of controversy, the Hatch-Metcalf Act was passed. The
Act amended an existing New York laboratory animal care statute into a
procurement law, requiring all dog pounds and all humane societies receiving
public funds to surrender animals to scientific institutions. The New York State
Humane Association actively fought enactment of the law; but its biggest, oldest
member organization, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals (ASPCA), whose board was dominated at that time by research inter-
ests, refused to take a position. Its president was Samuel Milbank of the Milbank
Foundation. The New York State Society for Medical Research, proponents of
the law, dismissed all the other organizations as anti-vivisection groups, thus
ensuring passage of the law.

Both the Erie County Humane Society and the Humane Society of Roches-
ter and Monroe County immediately gave up their pound contracts so that it
would not be necessary for them to release animals from their shelters to
laboratories. Only two organizations, the ASPCA and the Syracuse SPCA, con-
tinued to accept tax funds and were thus required to send dogs and cats to sci-
entific institutions. Between 1966 and 1974
repealed, ”The Syracuse SPCA delivered 14, 000 dogs and cats to Bristol-Myers,a
company with annual sales of more than a billion dollars.

Such was the power of the biomedical establishment at the time that the
ASPCA even went so far as to oppose an amendment offered just before the
Hatch-Metcalf Act was passed which would have authorized a representative of
the New York State Humane Association to accompany Health Department
inspectors on the rounds of laboratory animal rooms. The ASPCA was a mem-
ber of the New York State Humane Association, but it joined the New York
State Society for Medical Research in fighting the humane inspection, which, it
was claimed, ”would emasculate the bill.” The amendment was defeated, ensur-
ing that inspection under the Hatch-Metcalf Act was a whitewashing operation.
A few examples:

1953: A Health Department inspector took AWI representatives
through Cornell Medical School explaining how excellent the
care for the animals was while passing by a dog whose incision
had opened, allowing his internal organs to fall onto the ﬂoor
of the cage.

AWI was called to inspect the animal quarters at St. Vincent’s
Hospital where gross ﬁlth and massive infestation of ticks,
roaches, and other insects were found.

AWI was called by a secretary in New York University Dental
School about epizootics which were running through the ani-
mal colonies due to the fact that wild rodents were fouling the
cages, and cleaning was put off for so long that there was
scarcely a clear spot to set foot in the dog runway.

All these institutions received dogs from the ASPCA and were inspected
and certified by the Health Department and also by ASPCA employees who vis-
ited at the invitation of the laboratories. When the federal Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act was passed in 1966, the ASPCA ended even the gesture of sending
inspectors to laboratories but continued to supply them with dogs and cats until
1971.

Repeal of Animal Seizure Laws

In 1976, a reform movement swept the ASPCA, permanently ending the
supply of dogs and cats from its shelters to laboratories. In 1977, the New York
Assembly voted 126-14 to repeal the Hatch-Metcalf Act. Connecticut, Massa-
chusetts, Ohio and West Virginia also repealed similar acts.

This type of legislation has proved itself a failure. The claims issued for its
enactment, to the effect that dog dealing and stealing would cease if animals
were available to laboratories from humane societies and pounds, were proven
false in the most dramatic way by the very case which set in motion the enact-
ment of the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act. A dog was bought by a New York
hospital from a Pennsylvania dog dealer, although the hospital was entitled to
free dogs from the ASPCA. In other states, too, which passed animal seizure
legislation, laboratories often have not taken advantage of the law, preferring to
buy from dealers.

LAB.2: 4/3/90

Thirteen states prohibit the release of impounded animals to research
facilities: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
West Virginia. Of these, Massachusetts is the only state which specifically pro-
hibits the sale of pound animals brought in from other states as well: "No per-
son, institution, animal dealer, or their authorized agent shall transport . . . any
animal obtained from any municipal or public pound, public agency, or dog
officer . . . into the commonwealth for purposes of research, experimentation,
testing, instruction or demonstration” (Ch. 140, Sec. 174D, 1983).

Release'of impounded animals for research purposes is required in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, Iowa, Minnesota, Oklahoma (by pounds only; shelters may
release animals for research), South Dakota, and Utah.

Release of impounded animals for research use is allowed in Arizona, Cali-
fornia, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Recent efforts to repeal Minnesota’s law requiring release of animals from
pounds to research facilities have been unsuccessful. However, a law was
enacted in 1987 which provides for inspections of animal dealers by the Minne-
sota Board of Animal Health as well as the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
requires dealers to post signs informing the public that they sell animals to
laboratories, and opens dealers’ premises to the public to enable pet owners to
search for lost or stolen pets. A fine of $1,000 will be imposed on any individual
selling a dog or cat to a research facility without the permission of the owner.

The State of Washington enacted a law in 1989 to prevent pet theft.
Research animal dealers who sell stolen dogs or cats to scientific institutions or
who pose as adopters of animals responding to ”free to good home” classified
ads may now be punished by a fine of $10,000 and 5 years in jail. Research
facilities are required to maintain a ﬁle on each dog and cat, including
certification of the animal's origin, a photograph, and a physical description of
the animal, available for public inspection.

In 1983, Iowa passed a law authorizing suspension or revocation of the li-
cense of an animal shelter, auction, dealer, kennel, or pound for cruelty to ani-
mals.

Massachusetts, in 1985, authorized the Massachusetts SPCA and the Ani-
mal Rescue League of Boston to inspect all animal dealers licensed by the US.
Department of Agriculture, thus complementing their previously enacted law
allowing for inspection of research facilities.

In 1989, Kansas enacted legislation requiring annual licensing of all re-
search facilities, dealers, pounds, pet shops and kennels. The Commissioner of
Livestock has extensive authority to inspect facilities and to deny, suspend or re-
voke licenses. A similar law was passed in Iowa.

REGULATORY PROPOSALS STALLED IN COMMITTEE
BY MEDICAL LOBBYISTS

Between the years 1960 and 1966, a great deal of effort was devoted to
unsuccessful attempts to pass legislation based on the principles of the British
Act of 1876. But public interest in the treatment of laboratory animals was grow-
ing, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) decided to contract for a study
by Dr. David N. Ruth and Mr. Robert W. Cox on ”The Care and Management of
Laboratory Animals Used in the Programs of the Department of Health, Educa-
tion and Welfare” (DHEW). Submissions were widely solicited, and both the
Animal Welfare Institute and Society for Animal Protective Legislation pres-
ented documentation on visits to laboratories. AWI’s ”Critical Review of Condi-
tions in Institutions Receiving Funds Under DHEW Auspices” documented the
following:

1. Cages too small for animals to stand or lie in normal position.

. Failure to administer pain-relieving drugs after surgery.

. Failure to destroy suffering, moribund animals.

. Failure to supervise animals after surgery.

. Failure to provide a comfortable resting place for animals.

. Repeated use of the same animal for painful procedures.

. Failure to provide water.

. Failure to identify animals.

 




9. Immobilization of unanesthetized animals.
10. Filth.

A 210-page volume was produced, but NIH, dismayed by the extensive
evidence of mistreatment and neglect of laboratory animals and the obvious
need for regulatory legislation revealed by the study, quickly withdrew it. Hun-
dreds of copies were secreted in a storeroom. Senator Clark, however,
demanded and got a copy.

The first bill ever introduced in the United States Congress to regulate ani-
mal experimentation was sponsored by Senators John Sherman Cooper, Mike
Mansfield, E. L. Bartlett, Robert C. Byrd, Frank Church, Estes Kefauver, Wayne
Morse, William Proxmire, Jennings Randolph, Ernest Gruening, Pat McNamara,
Harrison Williams, and Joseph S. Clark. The bill was written by Abe Fortas and
introduced at the request of the Society for Animal Protective Legislation. As
soon as this bill was introduced, the National Anti-Vivisection Society and the
National Society for Medical Research, normally at each other’s throats, found
themselves in agreement: there must be no regulation of animal experimenta-
tion. When hearings were held two years later in the House of Representatives,
Major Charles Hume, founder of the Universities Federation for Animal Wel-
fare of Great Britain, emphasized the fact that, poles apart though they were,
these two groups actually corresponded with a view to helping each other
defeat regulatory legislation.

Opponents thought they had buried regulatory legislation, and in that
Committee they had. But they reckoned without the disappearance of a
Dalmatian dog named Pepper and the response of the House Agriculture Com-
mittee.

The Humane Society of the United States, under the direction of Fred
Myers, insisted that the British Act was not sufficiently strong and gave its sup-
port to the Moulder bill. The American Humane Association remained silent
and, when pressed, said it was studying the matter. When Congressman
Kenneth Roberts held two days of hearings on the Griffiths and Moulder bills,
the AHA sent no one to testify.’

Medical research groups and anti-vivisection groups opposed the bills; the
National Catholic Society for Animal Welfare said it would support the Moulder
bill if it were amended to eliminate all pain inﬂiction. Significant statements
were made by scientists and medical men who supported the Griffiths bill
(identical to" the Clark-Neuberger bill in the Senate) based on the principles of
the British Act, and also by knowledgeable Britons who had worked under the
Act and could testify from firsthand experience as to its workability and effec-
tiveness in preventing animal suffering without hampering research.

The American Medical Association felt differently, however, and editor-
ialized about what it termed ”humaniacs.” An objective and authoritative voice
was heard from England when the Report of the Departmental Committee on
Experiments on Animals was presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State
for the Home Department, April 1965.

The Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Sydney Littlewood, held
hearings over a two-year period to review the working of the British Act, giving
every individual and group who desired to be heard an opportunity. The result-
ing ”Littlewood Report,” a remarkable testimony to fairness and good judg-
ment, surveying every aspect of animal experimentation, of the treatment of the
animals, and of procurement, reported the views of scientists, of the public, and
of groups as diverse as the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare,8 whose
scientific approach is well known, and anti-vivisection organizations seeking
abolition of all experimentation on animals. The most widely quoted paragraph
in the 255-page Report is the first of the General Findings: ”Animal experiment
is a complex and highly specialised subject. It is also a moral and social problem
of the first magnitude and one that does not exclusively concern the expert.”

The ”Littlewood Report” was referred to repeatedly by two distinguished
medical men who ﬂew to the United States to testify at hearings held September
30, 1965, before the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee: Dr.
Lawrence Abel, former Vice President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Eng-
land and Consulting Surgeon to the Institute of Cancer Research, Royal Cancer
Hospital, and Sir Graham Wilson, former Director of the Public Health Service.

Speaking of the inspectorate under the British Act, Sir Graham said:

The Act is administered by the Home Office and is enforced by
specially appointed inspectors possessing a medical or veterinary
qualification. Their main purpose is regulatory and educational rather
than disciplinary. In their visits to the laboratories they satisfy them-
selves about the suitability of the conditions under which the animals
are kept and of the general well-being of the animals themselves; they

 




may assure themselves that the license holder is fully aware of what he
is permitted and not permitted to do; and they make useful sugges-
tions for overcoming difficulties of one sort or another.

Dr. Abel, speaking of the three principles—licensing, inspection, and the
pain rule—said:

The third British Principle is the Pain Rule. This sets the limit to
the amount of suffering which may be inﬂicted. We do not commit the
atrocities which are reported from time to time in some other
countries. We do not allow the extravagant cruelty committed by some
investigators of stress and shock. We have proved that the desired
results can be obtained by less inhumane methods. We are convinced
that the freedom of all and sundry to use animals indiscriminately
would not improve the value of research.

The hearings of the Health Subcommittee of the House Interstate and For-
eign Commerce Committee at which Sir Graham and Dr. Abel testified were
never published? Scheduled as two-day hearings, they were abruptly canceled
the morning of the second day and never rescheduled by Chairman Paul Rog-
ers, now a consultant for the National Association for Biomedical Research
(NABR). The biomedical establishment apparently considered it dangerous to
expose the public to facts about successful regulation of animal experiments.

RESNICK BILL BYPASSES THE HEALTH COMMITTEES

On July 3, 1965, Fay Brisk, a long-term campaigner for reform of the big
Pennsylvania dog dealers, called the Animal Welfare Institute for help to try to
get Pepper back to her owners, the Lakavage family. Mr. Lakavage, in the hospi-
tal with a heart attack, saw Pepper’s photograph together with seventeen other
dogs and two goats that had been temporarily unloaded from a Pennsylvania
dog dealer’s overcrowded truck. Mrs. Lakavage and the three young Lakavages
set off in pursuit of Pepper, who, allegedly, had been taken to a big New York
State dog dealer, Nersesian. When the exhausted family arrived, Nersesian
refused them entry.

Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, a well-established fighter for animal protec-
tion and chief sponsor of pending legislation to require humane treatment of
experimental animals, was out of town, but Sara Ehrmann, his Legislative Assis-
tant, responded to the AWI call for help by telephoning Congressman Resnick's
office in the District where Nersesian’s dog farm was located. Even Congres-
sional intercession failed, however; and Resnick, angered by Nersesian’s high-
handed refusal to admit the family to find their missing pet, decided he would
introduce a bill to prevent such wrongs.

Meantimd pressure by the State Police brought an admission from the
Pennsylvania dog dealer that he had taken his load not to Nersesian, as he first
had said, but directly to Montefiore Hospital in New York. Immediately, Fay
Brisk telephoned the hospital, could hear the rattling of the dog tags at the other
end of the phone, then the news: the dog had died on the operating table the
day before and already had been incinerated. The dog dealer insisted the dog
was not Pepper—the evidence was incinerated—but the call for female
Dalmatians, put out by the hospital to dealers rather than to breeders, had led to
introduction of the Resnick bill on July 9. The Resnick bill, written by attorneys
of the US. Department of Agriculture, required that dealers in dogs and cats
and the laboratories that purchased them be licensed, inspected, and adhere to
humane standards set by the Secretary of Agriculture. A companion bill was
introduced in the Senate by Senator Warren G. Magnuson, Chairman of the
Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Clark, who came to the Senate ﬂoor
at the same moment to introduce identical bills. In a brief colloquy they agreed
to co—sponsor, and Senator Daniel Brewster of Maryland joined them.

On September 5, Congressman W. R. Poage of Texas, Chairman of the
Livestock Subcommittee of the House Agriculture Committee, held hearings on
the Resnick bill. He was the first American legislator to hold hearings on labora-
tory animal? legislation with a view to enacting it. He had won passage of the
Humane Slaughter Act in 1958, and was destined to win again for laboratory
animals. Not easily, however. The bill was immediately attacked as anti-vivisec-
tionist by the National Society for Medical Research, which described it as a
”pincers movement” to cut off the supply of animals for laboratories. Anti-vivi-
sectionist groups, however, took but little interest in the matter. The demand for
action came from the general public, outraged by the article in Life magazine
showing Stan Wayman’s photographs of the shocking abuse of dogs in the deal-
ers’ hands.

The Life article was set in motion by Henry Luce after he looked over a col-
lection of photographs supplied by the Animal Welfare Institute, many of them
taken by photographers accompanying AWI Laboratory Animal Consultant,

 




Dorothy Dyce. Under the supervision of Life’s Nature Editor, Pat Hunt, the arti-
cle was completed and published February 4, 1966. More mail was received by
Life on this article than on any other in the history of the magazine, and Con-
gress received more mail on the pending bills than on civil rights or Vietnam.

In the face of such demand, the opponents began to modify their opposi-
tion. When Congressman Poage introduced the Committee bill, extending cov-
erage to all vertebrate animals, and Senator Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania intro—
duced an identical bill in the Senate, the opponents concentrated on exempting
scientific institutions from the humane standards and on cutting back the num-
ber of species covered. The Poage bill came unscathed through the Subcommit-
tee, but the full House Agriculture Committee cut it down to dogs and cats in
dealers’ premises only. Laboratory interests thus won a temporary victory and,
no doubt, believed they could continue to keep the objective veterinary inspec-
tors of the U. S. Department of Agriculture out of scientific institutions.

After the House passed the weakened version of the Poage bill, a Senate
Commerce Committee staff draft accomplished a comparable weakening of the
bills introduced by Senators Magnuson, Clark, Brewster, and Scott. Again, lab-
oratory interests made a stab at getting themselves exempted, but they had reck-
oned without Senator Monroney, who, as soon as he read the draft, prepared an
amendment restoring coverage of animals inside scientific institutions. Newspa-
pers throughout the country supported the Monroney Amendment in emphatic
terms. So hOtly debated was the issue that a second set of hearings was sched-
uled in the Senate Commerce Committee on May 25, 1966.

For six years the National Institutes of Health and its parent Department of
Health, Education and Welfare had opposed all moves toward effective legisla-
tion for humane treatment of research animals. Suddenly, when it became clear
that such opposition could no longer stem the demand for action, NIH asked
Senator Lister Hill, Chairman of the Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, to
introduce a bill written by NIH itself providing a self-policing system for
laboratories. Meanwhile, its representatives urged exemption of laboratories
from the straightforward, humane Senate Commerce Committee bill.

 




LAB.3: 4/3/90

Neither‘the Committee nor the Senate as a whole could be brought to sup—
port this maneuver. The Washington Evening Star stated editorially:

THE ANIMAL CRUELTY BILLS

Congress at last is headed toward enactment of a law to require
humane treatment of animals used in laboratory research and to halt
thefts of pets by dealers supplying this market. At the eleventh hour,
however, a snag has been encountered in the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee. Medical researchers, hostile to government supervision, (but
not government grants, it should be added), are attempting a switch
play. A bill introduced by Senator Hill of Alabama would head off fed-
eral inspection of how laboratories treat animals awaiting experiments.
Instead this authority would be given to a private group.

The medical men, in fact have such a group all ready and waiting.
Set up last year, it is called the American Association for Accreditation
of Laboratory Animal Care. Its members are of the establishmentgand
are staff members of medical schools and research institutions. And,as " I
the association’s brochure suggests, the 'inspections’ would be rather
friendly affairs.

There would be no surprise audits, such as those routinely carried
out now in the banking industry, for example. Instead a visit would be
scheduled by ’mutual convenience.’ It would not come distressingly
often—no more than once every five years. The inspectors, according
to the brochure, would charge fees ranging up to $1,000 for their trou-
ble.

If the laboratories are in fact treating their animals humanely, they
should have nothing to fear from a proposal by Senator Magnuson of
Washington that such inspections be made by the Department of Agri-
culture after standards have been published. His bill has nothing to do
with the anti-vivisectionists; the government would not interfere with
any laboratory tests or operations.

Certainly the public should not be deluded into thinking the Hill
proposal represents any kind of adequate substitute for impartial
inspection of such institutions.

Senator Magnuson had made plain his determination to report a bill out of
his Committee. The National Society for Medical Research and National
Institutes of Health, therefore, concentrated on trying to get the laboratories
exempted from compliance with humane standards set by the United States
Department of Agriculture and inspection by its representatives. Glowing
references to the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal
Care (AAALAC), for whose existence Dr. Maurice Visscher, President of the
NSMR, took credit, were a stock in trade; and at the final Senate Commerce
Committee hearings, representatives of the NIH and N SMR strongly supported
the NIH bill and opposed the Monroney Amendment. Testimony was limited to
medical witnesses at this hearing; and two courageous physicians, who had
been associated for years with efforts to obtain humane treatment of laboratory
animals, came to Washington to testify for the Monroney Amendment: Dr.
Nicholas Gimbel, Chief of Surgery at Metropolitan Hospital and Associate
Professor of Surgery at Wayne University Medical School, and Dr. Bennett Der-
by, Head of Neurology at Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan and
Assistant Professor of Neurology at New York University Medical School. Dr.
Gimbel and Dr. Derby urged the Senate Committee to provide for humane care
and housing of animals in research institutions. They emphasized that the
Department of Agriculture is the ideal agency to administer such requirements.
Dr. Gimbel, who had devoted considerable time to getting better treatment for
experimental dogs in different institutions, brought the question down to earth
by stating that if he were a dog, he would prefer to have the Department of Agri-
culture administer the law. He said the ”welfare of animals should be the
responsibility of a body which is primarily interested in them . . . the Depart-
ment of Agriculture,” and he added: ”If the scientists and organizations repre-
sented in AAALAC had done their job properly, we would not be holding hear-
ings here today. The time has come to bring in independent auditors.” The NIH
bill did not come to hearings.

The Senate Commerce Committee bill, under the leadership of Senator
Magnuson and Senator Monroney, received unanimous endorsement by the
Senate. Eighty-five Senators came to the ﬂoor to vote for it, and each of the fif-
teen who were absent and unable to vote stated in The Congressional Record that

 




they would have voted for it had they been present. The bill’s sanctions were
strengthened at the insistence of the House Conferees. They agreed to accept
the Senate amendments restoring humane care and housing of animals inside
laboratories and increasing the number of species of animals covered, on condi-
tion that the stronger House enforcement clauses be adopted.

Regulations were promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture February
24; and the law went into effect for animal dealers May 25 and for scientific
institutions August 24, 1967.

Congress broadened and strengthened this first federal law to prevent
abuses of test animals in 1970, 1976, and 1985. The 1966 Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act (fiercely contested by medical and pharmaceutical interests and the
associated industries that sell animals, cages, and equipment to scientific institu-
tions) set humane standards for dogs, cats, primates, rabbits, hamsters, and
guinea pigs in animal dealers’ premises and in laboratories prior to experimen-
tal use of animals. In 1970, the coverage was extended to the entire stay of ani—
mals in laboratories, where they must be maintained according to minimum
standards set by the Secretary of Agriculture. The veterinary care required
includes ”appropriate use of anesthetic, analgesic, and tranquilizing drugs.” All
warm-blooded animals designated by the Secretary are covered, but neither
birds, farm animals used in research, nor those species that constitute the large
majority of the millions of experimental animals used each year—mice and
rats—have yet been designated. Because inadequate appropriations have had to
be stretched to cover inspections of thousands of sites in laboratories, licensed
animal dealers, licensed exhibitors, registered exhibitors, and carriers under the
Act as amended, no Secretary has been willing to include more animals for
inspectors to check; however, in 1986 the Animal Legal Defense Fund prepared
a brief contending that the Act requires him to do so.

The important requirement for pain-relieving drugs and reporting on their
use or lack thereof was added in 1970. Reports by registered scientific institu-
tions on use of animals are filed with the U. S. Department of Agriculture and
are available for public scrutiny under the Freedom of Information Act. Many
institutions have failed to honor this section of the Act, necessitating additional
legislative and enforcement action.

Under the 1976 amendments sponsored by Agriculture Committee Chair-
man Thomas Foley,10 research institutions were moved to the same category as
exhibitors and dealers with respect to the imposition of fines for violations. Pre-
viously, research facilities were subject to a cease and desist order which they
would have to violate before a fine could be imposed. The 1976 amendments
also include a requirement that agencies of the federal government submit
proof that they are in compliance with the standards which private institutions
must meet under the eyes of veterinary inspectors of the U. S. Department of
Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. Representative
Margaret Heckler11 proposed and was successful in obtaining this essential
advance on the ﬂoor of the House.

The Animal Welfare Act now constitutes a solid, broad-based structure
whose 1976 amendments, sponsored in the Senate by Senator Lowell Weicker,
cover transportation of animals for research, exhibition, the pet trade, by com-
mon carriers and intermediate handlers. Its anti-dogfighting and cockfighting
provisions are detailed in Chapter IX.

The 1970 reporting requirements on painful experiments focused on the
responsibility of the institutional veterinarian to prevent suffering through
humane experimental design or through use of drugs to relieve pain or anxiety.
However, enforcement in this area has been virtually nil. The 1985 amend-
ments, which should have gone into effect December 23, 1986, remain to be
tested in practice because of the long delay, caused by anti-animal lobbyists, in
the promulgation of final regulations to implement the law.

COMMERCIAL DEALERS AND BREEDERS

The laboratory animal industry, supplying millions of animals to institu-
tions at ever increasing prices, is intensely opposed to regulatory legislation that
affects them and their clients. In 1979, it spawned the National Association for
Biomedical Research (NABR) and the Foundation for Biomedical Research
(FBR) to rival the National Society for Medical Research, which they entirely
absorbed and supplanted in a few years. NABR now orchestrates opposition to
all laws and regulations for laboratory animal welfare. Formation of the organi-
zations was, according to executive Frankie Trull, conceived in her living room.
Henry Foster, the veterinarian who built a two-room rat breeding business into
the multimillion dollar international laboratory animal production corporation,
Charles River Breeding Laboratories, and his son, an attorney, wrote the neces-
sary legal papers. Ms. Trull, an employee of Charles River, set about lining up
support among commercial and academic laboratories.

 




Meanwhile, Charles River was sold to the big optical company, Bausch and
Lomb, netting Dr. Foster about $38 million personally, according to press
reports. The pun-filled, full-page ads offering monkeys, guinea pigs, rabbits, and
other animals for sale have become more sober and strait-laced, but the inten-
sive campaign to market the maximum numbers of animals for experimentation
continues under the new ownership. Charles River has installations in France,
Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

Breeding animals for sale to laboratories is big business, and corporations
change hands in transactions based wholly on financial considerations. One of
the largest dog breeders, LRE, which houses several thousand dogs on its prem-
ises, was recently sold to Hazelton, which conducts toxicity tests on contract for
other institutions as well as breeding dogs and other laboratory animals.

ALTERNATIVES TO LABORATORY ANIMALS

As numbers of animals used in experiments and tests grew by the million, a
countervailing philosophy was increasingly advocated by animal protective
organizations. The ﬁrst serious contribution to the field was The Principles of
Humane Experimental Technique, by W. M. 8. Russell and R. L. Burch, produced
under the aegis of the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in 1959, with
some modest assistance from AWI. This pioneering book established the Three
R’s—Replacement, Reduction, and Refinement—which are now generally rec-
ognized as fundamental elements necessary to prevent large-scale unnecessary
suffering by laboratory animals. While Russell and Burch stressed the scientifi-
cally feasible, others advocated ”Alternatives Nowl”, claiming that substitutes
for animals already existed for all experiments and tests. Bills introduced in
Congress reﬂected different views of the subject, but they made up, if not a criti-
cal mass, solid evidence of public concern and hope.

By 1981, seven bills on alternatives and/or regulation of animal experi-
ments were pending in the Subcommittee on Science, Research and Technol-
ogy of the House Committee on Science and Technology. On October 13 and
14, 1981, Subcommittee Chairman Doug Walgren of Pennsylvania held hear-
ings, which drew unexpectedly wide media attention because Maryland police
had removed 17 monkeys just days earlier from a Silver Spring laboratory.
There they had been experimented on by Dr. Edward Taub under grants from
the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Taub and an associate were charged with
17 counts of cruelty for failing to supply veterinary care. Alex Pacheco, who had
worked at the Institute for Behavioral Research as a volunteer and had alerted
police to conditions there, showed horrifying pictures of the monkeys and their
quarters at the hearings.

Drafting of a composite bill containing some features from each of the
seven pending proposals was undertaken by the Subcommittee staff. Advice
was sought from the many organizations which had testified pro- or con- the
different bills. On August 4, 1982, Congressman Walgren proposed the new bill,
which was approved by his Subcommittee and its parent Committee. The bill
was referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcom-
mittee on Health and the Environment, and hearings were held by Chairman
Henry Waxman of California on December 9, 1982.

Senator Robert Dole introduced a bill based on the principles developed in
the October hearings. Senator John Melcher of Montana, the Congress’ only
veterinarian, joined him. Together, they appeared at the Waxman hearings and
testified for the Walgren bill, an unusual tribute to the importance of the legisla-
tion. However, no action was taken before the 97th Congress adjourned.

_\

THE DOLE-BROWN AMENDMENTS

When Senator Dole reintroduced his bill in 1983, he had it redrafted as an
amendment to the Animal Welfare Act, thus broadening its coverage to include
all/Registered Résearch Facilities (over 1,200) inspected by USDA.

This wise decision encouraged consideration by scientific groups who
began a slow move from point-blank opposition to demands for a variety of
modifications in the language of the bill. At hearings of the full Senate Agricul-
ture Committee, chaired by Senator Dole July 20, nearly every witness had sci-
entiﬁc qualiﬁcations. Humane groups were represented by Bennett Derby,
M.D., Ph.D., who had appeared at the crucial hearings which led to unanimous
Senate passage of the original Act.

Senator Dole’s masterful handling of the hearings paved the way for action,
but it was not to come in the 98th Congress. Opponents tried a new tack, ques-
tioning the need for the Dole bill. The Society for Animal Protective Legislation
prepared two thick binders of documentation outlining the urgent need for all
the bill’s provisions for minimizing pain and distress and strengthening the
authority of Agriculture’s veterinary inspectors.

 




 

 

  

Congressman George E. Brown, Jr. of California, well known for his suc-
cessful sponsorship of the 1978 humane slaughter amendments (see chapter
111), introduced a bill, HR. 5725, based on the Dole bill. On September 19, 1984,
he chaired hearings in his Subcommittee on Departmental Operations,
Research and Foreign Agriculture which drew a standing-room-only crowd
with long lines waiting outside the hearing room. Interest in the legislation had
been heightened by revelations of severe mistreatment of experimental
baboons at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. Sixty hours of self-
incriminating videotapes taken by a research team as a record of their experi-
ments showed virtually every rule of aseptic surgery being violated. Injured
baboons were painfully dangled and ridiculed by groups of laughing students.

The tapes were stolen by a group known as the Animal Liberation Front
and given to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. They excerpted 25
minutes from the many hours of footage. It was run repeatedly in a nearby
church on the day of the hearings.

Henry Mitchell's column in The Washington Post September 21, 1984 notes:
"Savagery is very much part of the nature of all humans I have ever known, and
that is one reason civilized nations have gone to such efforts to restrain it or
redirect it.” Citing the evidence and characterizing it as sickening, he wrote:
”Legislation is needed, and those who do not wish to concern themselves with
what amounts to ﬂamboyant sadism should at least have the grace not to
obstruct the long hard thankless labors of those who have not shied from the
evidence and who have at last come up with reasonable and moderate legisla-
tion.” Describing his feelings in watching five minutes of the tapes in St. Mark’s
Church, he concluded: "I left thinking it probably an esthetic error to vomit in a
church.”

Documentation of neglect and abuse in laboratories throughout the entire
country was derived from official reports 0f USDA veterinary inspectors
obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and presented by the Society
for Animal Protective Legislation in the form of a 6’x10’ chart. A heartening
message of support from Dr. Jean Mayer, President of Tufts University, was
delivered by Dr. Frank Loew, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, but
most testimony from scientific groups was severely critical. Congressman
Brown asked his staff to analyze all the criticisms. His bill did not emerge from
the Subcommittee.

Meantime, in the Health and Environment Subcommittee, Congressman
Walgren had succeeded in getting some provisions of his bill included in the
NIH reauthorization bill which was passed by the Congress but vetoed by Pres-
ident Reagan. In the 99th Congress, the bill, after some modification and enti-
tled the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, was passed again and Congress
overrode the President’s second veto. The animal welfare provisions are less
stringent than the Dole-Brown legislation, and they apply only to NIH grantees;
nevertheless, the two were destined to fit together well and reinforce one
another in a practical manner.

Senator Dole, elected Majority Leader of the Senate, reintroduced his bill at
the same time as Congressman Brown. This time the bills were identical, the
heroic work of staffers Sara Rasmussen for Brown and Mark Scanlan for Dole.
They produced a ﬁnal draft still containing every major animal protective provi-
sion, phrased in the manner least objectionable to the legion of opponents and
unremitting critics.

The New York Times editorialized on July 31, 1985 in support of the Dole-
Brown proposals, and in the following months, newspapers in every part of the
country followed suit.

The debate on the 1985 Farm Bill was continuing when the Majority Leader
brought his bill, Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals, to the Senate
ﬂoor, October 25. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Chairman of the Committee on
Labor and Human Resources, expressed reservations. The bill then went into an
intense discussion by the staffs of Senators Dole, Hatch, and Melcher and repre-
sentatives of the National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR), the
Feed Manufacturers Association, and the Society for Animal Protective Legisla-
tion. A bill calling for 16 different changes in Senator Dole’s bill had been pre-
pared for Senator Hatch by an NABR attorney. Every point had to be fought
through. Senator Dole appeared from time to time to ask what progress was
being made. At one point, Senator Melcher took part in the arguments, explain-
ing the reason for his language, ”a physical environment adequate to promote
the psychological well-being of primates.” He had seen laboratory chimpanzee
cages which, even though unoccupied at the time, he characterized as "ex-
tremely efficient, extremely expensive, and extremely cruel.”

A second series of amendments, this time consisting of no less than 32
changes, even including a $500 reduction in the ﬁne, was proposed. A night
meeting in the Dole office was called to resolve the differences. It appeared that

  




although academia was somewhat grudgingly resigne‘d to the legislation, the
pharmaceutical industry was not willing to stop ﬁghting. Indeed, it fought to the
end. Disagreement about the content continued, and Senator Melcher offered a
substitute bill on October 29th. This passed the Senate unanimously.

The House had already passed the Farm Bill without the Dole-Brown“ z“! 'i ‘_ "

amendments. Fortunately, Majority Whip Tom Foleﬂf Mgmd M 1,, f?” ’St‘fz)
himself a powerful friend of animals during the House-Senate Conference.
Congressman Foley, as noted earlier, was the author of the 1976 amendments to
the Animal Welfare Act. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la
Garza of Texas gave his blessing to the legislation in Conference. Lobbying to
kill the Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals continued to the very last
moment.

The Farm Bill, an enormously lengthy piece of legislation, was in Confer-
ence for days. The Conferees met in a small room in the Russell Senate Office
Building, and dozens of lobbyists from each of the special interests that stood to
gain or lose from some part of the complex bill lined the hallway outside the
room, waiting for news on decisions of the Conferees as staffers came in and
out. At 4:00 p.m. on December 12, it appeared that actionon the laboratory ani-
mal section was imminent. Weakening amendments were being urged by the
National Association for Biomedical Research, and Senator Dole had not yet
returned from out of town.

The sight of the Senate Majority Leader striding down the hall rein-
vigorated the weary Society for Animal Protective Legislation lobbyists waiting
for the outcome. ”You’re next,” he said to us. Then he was engulfed by a mass of
farm lobbyists. It was nearly eleven that night when we heard the good news
from Congressman Foley. The Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals Act
had come through the Conference unscathed!

The Conference report was approved by the House on December 16 and
two days later by the Senate. The Improved Standards for Laboratory Animals
amendments establish an information service in the National Agricultural
Library in cooperation with the National Library of Medicine to provide data on
alternatives to laboratory animals, help prevent unintended duplication of
experiments and tests, and provide information to institutions for instruction of
scientists and other personnel in humane practices as required by the new law.
Each registered research facility must appoint an Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee, including a veterinarian and a person not affiliated with the
institution, to represent the general community interests in the proper care and
treatment of: animals. The committee must inspect the animal laboratories twice
a year and report deficiencies to the institution for correction. If not corrected
promptly, the U. S. Department of Agriculture must be notified for enforcement
action, and any funding agency involved informed for a decision on whether
the grant should be suspended or revoked.

Investigators are required to consider alternatives and to consult with a vet-
erinarian before beginning any experiment which could cause pain. They must
adhere to standards set by the Secretary of Agriculture for pre- and post-surgi-
calcare, use of pain-relieving drugs or euthanasia, against use of paralytics with-
out anesthesia, and unnecessary use of the same animal for more than one
major operation. Exceptions to the standards may be made only when specified
by a research protocol and an explanation given for any deviation. Fines for vio-
lations were raised from $1,000 to $2,500, and for violating a cease and desist
order, from $500 to $1,500. Each animal may count as a violation, as may each
day of failure to obey a cease and desist order.

Interest in protection of laboratory animals has grown worldwide, and two
countries made significant improvements in their national laws in 1986: the
United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. The full text of these
laws appears in the Appendix. Of particular note in the new British Act is recog-
nition of gradations of stress or pain and justification thereof. This begins with
the stress caused by putting an animal in a cage and progresses to the point of
procedures prohibited because of extreme painfulness.

In issuing project licenses, the British Secretary of State is required to
”weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit
likely to accrue.” Both project licenses and individual licenses are mandatory
under the new law. As in the 1876 Act, if an inspector considers that an animal
is undergoing excessive suffering, he may require it to be immediately killed.

The new German law was introduced by Minister of Agriculture Ignaz
Kiechle. It forbids, with provision for special exceptions, the use of animals for /
tests on weapons, tobacco, washing powders, and cosmetics. Authorization for ‘
experiments are to be supervised by advisory commissioners. Animal protec— :
tion organizations may nominate up to a third of the commissiongrjmembers. 74 S
The law covers all experiments leading to pain or injury of an animal.

 




APPROPRIATIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT

The struggle for protection of laboratory animals has had to be fought on
many fronts. When passed in 1966, an appropriation of $300,000 was barely
achieved. Slowly, annual appropriations were worked up to $4,865,000 and
remained at the same level despite attempts by the Office of Management and
Budget to reduce them. In both 1985 and 1986, the Administration recom-
mended that no money whatever be allocated to administer the law and inspect
the 1,219 registered research facilities, the 3,414 licensed dealers’ premises, the
1,386 exhibitors’ premises, or the 374 intermediate handlers operating during
those years.

In 1985 the Congress simply restored the funds, but in 1986, following pas-
sage of the Dole-Brown amendments, Congress voted an increase to $5,878,000,
specifying that $750,000 be used for the information service designated by the
new legislation at the National Agricultural Library in cooperation with the
National Library of Medicine. The Senate Appropriations Committee report
stated:

For enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act the Committee con-
curs with the House in providing $5,878,000 over the budget request.
This is also $1,902,000 more than the 1986 adjusted level. Included in
this appropriation is $750,000 for creation of an information service at
the National Agricultural Library which will include information on
available alternatives to the use of live animals in research. The
remainder of the increase is for the general expansion of the program.

On the House ﬂoor, Congressman Bob Traxler of Michigan said: ”We
restore funding for the Animal Welfare Act once again, rejecting the notion that
enforcement of the act should be turned over to other authorities. That proposal
is simply not sensible in today’s interstate economy.”

In 1987, the Office of Management and Budget again recommended zero
funding for the Animal Welfare Act. However, for the first time, the Department
of Agriculture protested, and the budget figure emerged as $4.947 million, a ﬁg-
ure from which the $750,000 appropriation for the information service at the
National Agricultural Library had been subtracted and which could not cover
the requirement for continued inspection of research facilities until all
deficiencies were corrected. Congress appropriated $6.125 million for Fiscal
Year 1987. In 1988 and 1989, the budget figure again was $4.947 million, but
$6.197 million was appropriated; and the budget request for Fiscal Year 1990
was $7.567 million. Animal protective organizations and scientific groups re-
quested $10 million for enforcement of the law, and the budget request for FY
1991 was raised to $8.688 million. The groups are requesting $12 million in or-
der to ensure adequate inspection. In 1990 about 25% of dog dealers were nev-
er inspected at all. Citizen demand for sufficient funds to enforce the law contin-
ues to be urgently necessary.

 




LAB.3A: 10/18/89

REGULATIONS AND ENFORCEMENT

In October 1988, a reorganization of the Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service took place. It created a new division, Regulatory Enforcement and
Animal Care (REAC). Enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act has been
removed from Veterinary Services and placed with REAC. REAC inspectors are
assigned on a full-time basis to enforcement of the Act, but their numbers are
inadequate to make the frequent inspections necessary to enforce the law-11y

Citizen complaints concerning research facilities, animal dealers, animal
auctions, and other entities covered by the Animal Welfare Act, including /\
circuses, zoos, airlines, and the wholesale pet industry, should be directed to the /’“. ( . ' ‘ .,
nearest REAC office or to the central office at Hyattsville. For names and phone ﬂx , x///[, I-.-) 121/7. .
numbers, see the Appendix. Citizen complaints are important in protecting ani- "e- /' " ’ " ‘ ' / ‘
mals because of REAC’s staff limitations. It is the policy of REAC to investigate '
all complaints.

Having failed to prevent enactment of the Improved Standards for Labora-
tory Animals amendments by Congress, opponents transferred their efforts to
the agencies and succeeded in delaying the regulations which must be promul-
gated before the legislation can be enforced. Proposed regulations for Parts 1
and 2 were first issued by the Department of Agriculture in March 1987. The
National Association for Biomedical Research (NABR) inspired thousands of
letters of protest against these well-prepared regulations. The result was that,
rather than being made final, they were withdrawn, and two years passed
before rewritten regulations for Parts 1 and 2 were reproposed and a proposal
for Part 3 regulations finally appeared. ‘

An even more intensive effort by NABR and its constituents followed.
However, a lawsuit filed by the Animal Legal Defense Fund against the Secre-
tary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Direc-
tor of the Office of Management and Budget was viewed favorably by Judge
Richey, who heard the case in the U. 8. District Court. A timetable was set up
with the Justice Department, and on August 31, 1989, final regulations for Parts
1 and 2 were published in the Federal Register.

Part of the campaign against Part 3 regulations is the issuance of inﬂated
figures on compliance costs. As we go to press, an extended delay is expected
with respect to the requirements for exercise for laboratory dogs and an envi-
ronment adequate to promote the psychological well-being of primates.
