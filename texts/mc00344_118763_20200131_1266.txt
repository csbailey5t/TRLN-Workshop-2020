Your letter of thanks is most welcome and I shall certainly

pass your greetings along to Grace.

With regard to the bill which would allow the free importation
of wild animals, H.R. 1839, an amendment was added to this
bill in the Senate Finance Committee to provide for increase
quotas on beef, veal and lamb imports. The amendment passed
the Senate and the portion concerning the import of wild
animals was stricken. It is highly unlikely this bill will

be revived.

Again, my thanks for your letter and for the benefit of your

Opinion.

Dear Friends:

It was good of you to let me have your views regarding
H. R. 1839, which would permit the free importation of wild
birds and animals for exhibit purposes.

When the bill was reported by the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, Senator Mansfield's amendment was added which would
provide for restrictions on the amount of foreign meat that
can be imported into the United States. I cosponsored two
separate bills on meat imports only, and supported amend-
ments to the Farm Bill that would have protected the American
stockmen. During Senate deliberation on H. R. 1839, a motion
was made to strike the language dealing with the free importa-
tion of wild birds and animals, and this motion was passed by
a voice vote. I supported this move; thus, free importation
of these birds and animals is prohibited.

Thanks again for writing, and best regards.

Sincerely yours,

1667 "H" Street

Napa, California

Dear Mr. Mays:

This will acknowledge and thank you for your letter of July 20th
regarding HR 1839, HR 5h30 and S 533.

I can appreciate your concern over HR.1839. However, I would point
out that the Senate Finance Committee has amended the bill to include a
provision establishing quotas on the importation of foreign meats. In view
of the critical situation in the domestic cattle industry because of the
high level of beef imports particularly, this issue will dominate the de-
bate and will be the determining factor in the Senate's action on the bill.

I was a co-sponsor of legislation to deal with the meat import prob—
lem separately and co-sponsor of an amendment to the wheat—cotton bill which
was approved earlier this year. .As a result of the Administration's Oppo-
sition, both the legislation and the amendment were rejected and we are now
faced with the last course of action available to deal with the beef import
problem, namely the amendment to HR 1839.

Because of the importance of the livestock industry to Kansas I intend
to support the amendment and if it is approved I will support the bill. I
regret for your sake that it is necessary to take this position, but I am sure
you will understand that there appears to be no alternativeet this point.

S 533 and HR.5M3O are currently pending in the Senate Committee on La—
bor and Public Welfare and the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Com-
merce, respectively. I am not a member of the Senate Committee and have not
therefore had an opportunity to study this measure as thoroughly as I would

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your message urging my support of legislation
for the humane treatment of experimental animals.

I agree with you that if anything can be done to alleviate
the suffering of animals without hindering research we should take
the necessary steps.

The Senate bills have been referred to the Committee on
Labor and Public welfare and are pending in the Subcommittee on Health
where I am hopeful that action will take place soon.

I am.not a member of this committee but when the legislation

finally comes before the full Senate I will go into its provisions and

the committee reports with the intention of supporting sound legislation
in this area.

With best wishes,

Faithfully,

Paul H. Douglas

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Garner:

Some time ago you were good enough to tell me of your
opposition to the provision in HR 1859 which permitted
the free entry of wild animals and birds for exhibition.
When the bill was before the Senate, we voted to delete
this provision entirely.

to delete the provision. If I am a member of the Senate
at that time I will certainly do my best.

As you may know, there are a number of bills presently

would like to thank you for writing me.

I agree with you that we need to control the
importation of wild animals to be used for commercial purposes
and that every possible step should be taken to insure the
liumane treatmrnt of animals and to conserve wildlife. I was
happy therefore that when H.R.1839 came before the Senate for
consideration, Senator Keating of New York introduced an

endment to strike from the bill those sections which would

permit the free importation of wild animals and birds. Senator'

Keating's amendment was passed by unanimous consent, and I was
able to vote for the bill.

Thank you for writing to me concerning this matter,
I was glad to hear from you. Please feel free to write me at
any time on problems of concern to you.

My dear Merrill: M M;

Ihaveyour letter of the 27th and I will certainly bring
it to the attention of my colleagues on the Senate Labor and
Public Welfare Committee.

The Committee's calendar is still quite crowded with
a backlog of work which accumulated during our long fight in the
Senate against the so—called Civil Rights Bill, and it is good that
you have gotten in touch with Congressman Kenneth Roberts about
the possibility of hearings on his bill. Such hearings by the House
Committee would, in effect, be a continuation of hearings on the
subject of humane treatment of laboratory animals which were
started sometime ago.

Let me add that the Senate Labor and Public Welfare
Committee has still not received the views of the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare on this pr0posed legislation,
but I will continue to keep your interest very much in mind.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes:

Thank you for your letter opposing H.R. 1839, the bill to amend
the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide for the free importation of
'wild.animals and birds which are intended for commercial exhibi-
tion in the united States.

I am.happy to inform.you that the provision repealing the 7 1/2
per cent duty on wild'birds and animals was deleted.from the

bill on the floor and is not a part of the bill finally approved
by the Senate.

Let me Just say that I share your view on this important matter

and supported the successful effort to delete the provision from
the bill. ,

Since H.R. 1839 was previously approved by the Hbuse it will now
go to conference where I hope the Senate action eliminating this
.onerous provision will be upheld.

With all good wishes,

Sincerely,

PAT. MCNAMARA, U.S.S.

Deer Mrs; ~rothers:

Thanks for your letter of July 19, and I appreciate having
for consideration your comments concerning elimination of

the wild.bird and wild animal imnort provisions from.H.R4

log? when it comes before the Senate.

As you.know, this bill was used as the vehicle for the so—
called Mansfield amendment establishing imnort quotas for
red meat products brought into the United States; The amend—
ment was attached to the bill by the Senate Finance Committee
and reported to the full Senate. 3. R. 1839 is now pending
on the Senate Calendar from which the leadership may motion
it my for debate.

I an grateful for your views on eliminating the birdnanimsl
section of H; R. 1839, and I will keep them.in mind should
such.a notion be made during debate he legislation.

The calendar of our Labor and Public Welfare
Committee is still quite crowded with a backlog of work
which accumulated during our long fight in the Senate against

but I will bring your letter and interest to the attention of my
colleagues on the Committee for their earnest consideration.

Let me assure you that I am continuing to keep in
touch with a number of individuals and groups who are working
together for legislation to insure humane treatment of laboratory
animals and that I will continue to help in the matter in any way
I can.

With kindest regards and best wish to you and our

Mrs. Marietta Gihle
2316 Third Street
‘Winthrop Harbor, Illinois

Dear Mrs. Gihle:

Thank you for your letter giving your reasons for opposing
H. R. 1839, a bill which would remove the duties on the importation of
wild animals and birds intended for commercial exhibition.

I realize that conditions of cruelty exist when these animals
are shipped into our country in such abundance that their care is not an
economic concern. I question the proposal that the business of commer-
cially exhibiting or selling these animals or birds should receive a
consideration in importation that other businesses are not receiving on
inanimate goods. I voted against the bill.

The bill was reported favorably by the Senate Finance Committee,
however, for a controversial amendment restricting meat imports had been
attached as a "rider". This added measure has become the major point of
discussion about the bill. These two measures ought to be separated and
voted on independently. If this is not the case, I am.afraid that the
amended bill may pass the Senate.

If the bill passes the Senate, it will be returned to the House
for its approval of the meat import amendment. It is very much in the
interest, therefore, of those who oppose lifting the import duty on wild
animals and birds to make their views known to their Congressmen, in’
addition to their Senators. I opposed H. R. 1839 in its original form
and am Opposed to the amendment restricting meat imports. I hope that
the Senate will see fit to defeat the entire bill. But it will be by no
means easy; And it will take a concerted effort on the part of interested
citizens to help bring this about. ‘Will you help?

Faithfully, \JJS

Dear Mr. Faust:

Thank you for informing me of your strong Opposition to H. R. 1839,
which would provide for the free importation of wild animals and birds
intended for exhibition in the United States.

This bill passed the House last February and was referred to the
Senate Finance Committee. Here an amendment was added to restrict the
quotas of beef imported into this country.

While there was little support for the prOposal to eliminate the
tariff on wild animals, the Committee reported H. R. 1839 because of the
strong interest in the beef quota amendment.

It is very possible that when H. R. 1839 is taken up on the Senate
Floor efforts will be made to strike the original provisions of the bill
regarding the importation.of wild animals and birds.

As you may know, I have often expressed my Opposition to cruel hand-
ling of animals and needless suffering inflicted upon them. You may be
certain that my views remain the same, and that I will keep in mind your
strong opposition to this tariff measure when the bill is considered on
the Floor.

Thank you again for your interest in bringing your views to my
attention.

I have your letter of recent date expressing ’
your views in opposition to H. R. 1839, unless the
provision allowing free importation of wild animals
and birds is eliminated.

As you know by now, this bill passed in the
Senate on July 28, by a vote of 72 to 15. However,
the provision to provide for free importation of wild
animals and birds for exhibition was eliminated. The
bill has now been referred back to the House of
Representatives.

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Steiner:

Thank you for your recent message supporting legis—

lation to provide for more humane treatment of experimental
animals.

I agree that adequate standards should be established
and maintained to protect experimental animals from need-
less suffering. Such standards are not now universal, as
your letter points out.

Of course, we must seek to avoid inhibiting vital
medical and scientific research, and that is why the area
has posed problems for legislation. I shall make a point
of sharing your letters with my colleagues on the Labor
and Public Welfare Committee who will initially consider

this legislation. That is the most effective forum for
your views.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Steiner:

Thank you for your recent communication regarding
humane treatment to experimental animals.

Several bills on this important matter
have been introduced and referred to Committee, but
Committee review has not been completed and the legisla-
tion has not taken syape for final action by the Senate.
At this time I think it best to reserve judgment until the
Senate's deliberations are finished, because any promising
proposal clearly involves attaining a delicate balance
between the need for extensive research and humane respect
for animal life.

I will give the subject the thorough study it
deserves and you can be assured that your views will
receive my sympathetic cons ideration.

Again thank you for writing. I very much appre-
ciate having the benefit of your thoughts.

Mrs. Charles H. watson ﬁgs“
2316 Thayer Street i
Evanston, Illinois

Dearers. watson:

Thank you for your letter urging my support for the humane treatment of
animals used in research, as preposed in S. 533.

As you know, legislation often undergoes many changes from its inception
to the time it comes up for a vote. I am not a member of the Committee
where the legislation is pending, but, from the hearings last fall, I
feel that probably the Clark-Neuberger bill (8.533) and the similar bill
in the House (H.R. 5&30) are good bills because they contain many funda-
mental requirements without excessive restrictions. Ihese bills are
based on the principles of the British Act which has proved to be very
effective over a long period.

I am hopeful that legislation may'be passed without further delay to
improve animal housing where needed and to alleviate the suffering of the
animals used for research. The opposition by those who do not realize
the need and are fearful of Obstructing research is such that, if too
much is asked, nothing will be passed and the animals wilﬂnot be helped.

I intend, therefore, to study the legislation very carefully when it comes
to the Senate floor. At that time I will vote for a sound bill which will
not hamper responsible research.

With best wishes,

Paul H. Douglas
ETEHCp

 




 

The other proper legislative proposal would be to work at
the state and national level for appropriate sanitary health regulations
to cover the interstate transportation and the display of these wild
animals. Such measures would have my wholehearted support. Again, this
is not the issue here. I am enclosing a reprint of my remarks in the
Senate when I once again secured Congressional approval for the preserva-
tion of the great Tule-Klamath Wildlife Refuges in Northern California.

As a conservationist, I thought you would be interested in seeing these
comments.

With kindest regards,

Sincerely yours,

Dear Miss Jarboe:

It was extremely thoughtful of you to write
me about my part in defeating the measure relating to
imports of wild birds and animals for commercial
purposes. I am happy to report that the House has
accepted a modified version of the Senate amendment
and there will be no license for the exploitation
of wild birds and animals.

Although this is to some a small matter, I
believe the fabric of a society's humane reverence
for all life.is composed of just such matters as
these.

Dear Mr s. Bradbury:

Thank you for your letter informing me of your strong opposition
to H. R. 1839, which would provide for the free importation of wild
animals and birds intended for exhibition in the United States.

This bill passed the House last February and was referred to
the Senate Finance Committee, where an amendment to restrict beef
imports was added to the original language.

While there was little support for the proposal to eliminate the
tariff on wild animals, the Committee reported H. R. 1839 to the Senate
Floor because of the strong interest in the beef quota amendment.

The full Senate, in considering the bill last Tuesday, approved
the beef import restrictions but voted to eliminate the provision regarding
wild animals and birds. The Senate version of H. R. 1839, which would
have no effect on the tariffs on wild animals, will now go back to the
House for consideration.

I have often expressed my opposition to cruel handling and
treatment of animals, and I am pleased, as I know you are, by the
recent vote to eliminate this provision.

Thank you for your interest in writing to me.

Sincerely yours,

Mrs. Alice Rogers
2650 h6th Avenue
San Francisco, California

Dear Mrs. Rogers:

As you know, I am deeply committed to conservation. The
fact is, H. R. 1839 has nothing to do with conservation. H. R. 1839,
if enacted, would.merely eliminate the 7 l/2% ad valorem.duty which is
now levied.on some of the wild.animals which are now imported into the
United States. The duty on wild birds is 19 cents each on those valued
not over $5.00 each and 9% ad valorem.on those valued at $5.00 or more
each.

As of July 1, 1963, these rates were reduced to 17 cents
each and 8% ad valorem.respectively. As you can see this paltry duty
will not keep out wild aminals and wild birds. If they are imported
by a municipal or public zoo they come in free but if they are imported
by private importers who later sell to a municipal or public zoo, this
duty must be paid and thus the duty is passed on to the public body.
What the duty really means in its application is that wild animals and
wild.birds are sometimes kept for an unreasonable long time at the point
of arrival in the United States while the customs procedures are processed.
This lengthy delay often injures the birds and aminals and is completely
beyond the control of the importer.

If one objects to the importation of wild animals and wild
birds in the United States, the proper position for one to take is to
urge an increase in the tariff on both catagories to be applied equally
to public zoos and private importers so that it would then be absolutely
prohibitive to import such wild animals and birds. This is a logical
position with which I would have no quarrel although frankly I do not
believe it would.be in the public interest. I think with proper care the
people of this country ought to have the opportunity to see the wild animals
and'wild.birdS'Which exist in other lands. Hewever, since this is not the
issue in the present case, I do believe that the discriminatroy tariff
which is not prohibitive but merely a nuisance ought to be removed.

Dear Hrs. MnPherson:

Thank you for your letter opposing H.R. 1839, which would lift
the tariff on wild animals, birds, and fish imported for exhibition.

At present, such imports require no tariff if the animals or birds
are for use in any scientific, public collection for exhibition for
scientific or educational purposes. This bill would give the same
right to any importer for public exhibition purposes. It would
have no‘bearing on conservation or treatment of such animal life,
since at present there is no restriction on importation,-provided
the duty required is paid. In other words, just as many are pro~
bably imported nOW3 but private buyers for exhibition collections
pay a duty which would no longer be required.

I hope this clarifies the situation for you.

As you noted, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public

it appears most unlikely that any action will be taken on
8.533 during the present session of Congress.

However, the House of Representatives held hearings in
September of l962 on similar measures. For your interest I
am enclosing a copy of these hearings.

Please be assured that I share your deep concern about
this matter. I sincerely hope that humane treatment for such
animals will be insured in the future.

Dear Mrs. Howson:

In view of your interest, I want you to know
that I voted to eliminate the provision in H. R. 1839

which would have allowed the free importation of wild
animals and birds.

Therefore, the bill as approved by the Senate
yesterday does not contain this provision.

Sincerely, .

No. 89

 

SCIENTISTS ARE ,NOT ROMANS:
THE LABORATORY IS NOT THE
COLOSSEUM

Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. President, there
are many ways, of course, to measure
the level of ' civilization attained by a na-
tion: Citizens of a highly developed civ-
ilization treat each other with respect
and the less fortunate among them with
sympathy and concern. Citizens of
such a society also treat the members
of the animal kingdom with care and
consideration. '

A good man would no more kick his
dog than he would beat his child.

We have read recently—and with con-
cern—of vanishing numbers of song-
birds on the eastern coast eradicated
along with the Japanese beetle and crab
grass by the overuse of pesticides.
There will soon be a silent spring in
the East. -

We have read recently of the declin-
ing number of African game " animals
and of the danger that such-"as the hip-
popotamus and the rhinoceros will soon
be extinct. The earth would be a lesser
place without these remarkable crea-
tures.

Money has been collected, organiza-
tions formed, hearings held, and action
taken to solve these problems. They are
not yet solved but we are working on
them.

There is, however, a problem shocking
in its extent and appalling in its depth
which exists across the whole country
and which is supported in many ways
by Government funds.

I refer to the inhumane treatment of
laboratory animals. For far too long
we in the Senate and in the Congress
have failed to act so as to ensure the sen-
sible, adequate, and reasonable treat-
ment of animals subjected to scientiﬁc
experimentation. Too often in the past
this matter has been obscured by the
antivivisectionists who by seeking the
whole loaf have received none. I am
not arguing the antivivisection cause:
I am disassociating myself from this
cause.

Three points are clear:

First. Vivisection is 'necesssary for

S mate

modern science. Without vivisection
we would.not have the polio serum, anti-
biotics and many of the most modern
surgical techniques. Our hope for a
control or cure for cancer is in part de-
pendent upon experimentation with
laboratory animals. This is perhaps re-
grettable but it is true.

Second. The Federal Government is
investing billions of dollars a year in
medical and biological research. This is
money well spent. Literally millions of
animals are being used, in this research.

~ This, too, is worthwhile.

. Third. Most unfortunately, however, in
a few of the laboratories supported by‘
Government funds these animals receive
cruel and inhumane treatment:

Cages are too small to allow the ani-
mal room to stand.

There are no regular water or feeding
facilities for the animals.

Inadequate sanitation facilities have
caused infestations of vermin and dis-
ease.

Surgical operations are performed
without anesthetics, leading -‘to severe
pain and shock.

No postoperative care is provided once
the experiment operation is completed.

A single animal used as a training
ground for a' crew of surgical students
operating upon it in a series of opera-
tions, one immediately following the
other.

Experimental animals are clamped
into observation forms which hold them
immovable for many weeks.

Such practices as these are unneces-
sary and cruel. They should be stopped;
they must be stopped. No one, no one
can say that the progress of modern sci-
ence would be hindered or slowed in any
way by the elimination of such prac-
tices.

We must recognize that scientists need
experimental animals. Scientists in
turn must recognize that unnecessarily
cruel and inhumane treatment of these
animals will not be tolerated.

The Society for Animal Protective Leg-e
islation of New York City has prepared
a short list of six points for the protec-
tion of laboratory animals. These points
outline the essential features which leg-
islation in this ﬁeld must have. I. ask

unanimous consent that these may be
printed: in the RECORD at this point.

There being no objection, the list was
ordered to be printed in the Raconn, as
follows:

If you are for a law to prevent needless
suffering-to animals in laboratories without
hampering responsible research, here are the
basic requirements:

A good bill must include these provisions:

1. Unannounced inspection by qualiﬁed,
full-time inspectors with access to animal
quarters, laboratories, and records of animal
use.

2. Individual licensing by governmental
authority of all scientists desiring to use
live, vertebrate animals, with the right to
remove said licenses from persons respon-
sible for inhumane treatment.

3. Pain-curbing provision that animals
suﬂering severe, enduring pain must be pain-
lessly killed instead of being allowed to
linger in agony or being used over again.
Failure to comply with the above automati-
cally gives the inspector the right to destroy
the animal painlessly himself. '

4. Humane care and housing, including
normal exercise. comfortable resting places,
and adequate food and water for all animals.

5. Student work, as distinct from research
conducted by qualiﬁed scientists, must be
painless. ‘ ,

Any bill which does not have these provi-
sions cannot prevent abuses in laboratories.
and therefore should not be enacted.

A good law should further require:

6. Records that include a brief statement
of what is to be done to the animals and
why, identiﬁcation of animals and eventual
disposition, and a brief annual report.

Mr. BARTLETT. Mr. President, the

British have had a humane treatment
law such as this since 1876. The law is
carefully enforced. It is not recorded
that it has in any way 'restricted the
growth of science or medicine in the
United Kingdom.
' Civilization has come a long way from
the Roman games held in’ the Colosseum
where lions and tigers and elephants
and bulls and gladiators would ﬁght to
the death for the amusement of the
crowds.

What we no longer allow in the Colos-
seum we should now stop in the
laboratory.

ﬁber Hrs. Stafford:

Thank you for your communication advising me of your interest
in legislation governing the treatment of animals which are used
for scientific experimentation.

As you know, bills have been introduced in both Houses of Congress

and are presently pending before the appropriate committees await-
ing further action.

In the past I have supported legislation, both in committee and on
the floor of the Senate, to improve existing government facilities
for housing animals used in various types of experimental research.
Construction is now underway for an animal pharmacological building
for the Federal Food and Erug Administration as the result of an
appropriation bill passed last session.

I am, of course, concerned that animals used for research by the
Federal Government be treated as humanely as possible without
hampering vital scientific progress. YOu.may be sure that I will
give this measure careful study when it comes before the Senate
for consideration.

Dear Mr. Brant:

Thank you for your recent communication regarding

Q

humane treatnent to experimental animals.

Several bills on this important matter
have been introduced and referred to Committee, but
Committee review has not been completed and the legisla-
tion has not taken shape for final action by the Senate.
At this time I think it best to reserve judgment until the
Senate's deliberations are finished, because any promising
proposal clearly involves attaining a delicate balance
between the need for extensive research and humane resyeet
for animal life. '

I will give the subject the thorough study it
deserves and you can.he assured that your views will
receive my symyathetie consideration.

Again thank you for writing. I very much appre~
ciate having the benefit of your thoughts.

Dear Miss Jarboe:

Thanks for your recent letter and enclosed leaflets. You will be
glad to learn that I have indicated on many occasions that I believe
the National Institutes of Health and all other tax-supported Agencies
should take all reasonable precaution against mistreatment of experimental
animals. I am.sorry that the 88th Congress has concluded without bringing

Dear Friends:

I have received.your letter of July 20 and note that you are in
California on your vacation. I hope you are enjoying your visit to
California.

You ask that I oppose H.R. 1839 unless the provision allowing
free importation of wild animals and wild'birds is eliminated. You
also ask that I support S. 533 and H.R. 5&30, bills to provide for
the humane treatment of vertebrate animals used in experiments by
recipients of Federal grants.

H.R. 1839 is a bill to amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to provide
for the free importation of animals and wild birds Which are intended
for use in scientific, public collection for exhibition for scientific
or educational purposes. It also contains a provision for imposing
quotas upon the importation of beef, lamb and.mutton. This bill was
passed.by the House of Representatives and it is now on the Senate
Calendar. You may be assured that, in the event any of these bills
comes before the full Senate for debate and vote, . will bear in
mind.your recommendations.

Thank you for your. recenﬁi’ietter in strong support of
legislation to insure the humane treatment of animals used for
research purposes.

As one who is deeply interested in the humane treatment of
all our domestic animals, I am in sympathy with proposals which
are intended to insure that reasonable measures are adopted to
protect experimental animals from unnecessary harm and discomfort.
It is in this light that 1 will consider any proposals for Cong-
ressional investigation and for corrective legislation.

Perhaps this year at least extensive hearings can be held,
at an early date, on the bills that have been introduced. This
could be an improvement over the last Congress, when no concrete
action was taken, and an intensive study could provide the impetus
needed to have a satisfactory proposal approved by this Congress.

Thank you again for taking the time to write to me. I
appreciate hearing your views on this question.

With all best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

I agree that adequate standards should be estab-

from needless suffering. Such standards are not now
universal, as your letter points out.

Of course, we must seek to avoid inhibiting vital
medical and scientific research, and that is why the
area has posed problems for legislation. I shall make

Thank you for your views in your recent letter to me on
S. 533, a bill which would require humane treatment of animals
in the experimental laboratorieS. I, too, am a lover of animals
and feel there should never be any needless or unnecessary
cruelty to animals, even in our experimental laboratories.

I have checked on this bill and learned it was introduced
on January 25, 1963, and was referred to the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare and the Bureau of the Budget for a report on
January 30. No report has been received by the Labor .ld Public
Welfare Committee, of which I am a member. It is unlikely that
any further action will be taken on this measure unless favorable
reports are received from the two agencies mentioned.

Grace joins with me in sending our very best wishes.

Dear Mrs. Staub:

I appreciate your views about appropriations for

Through such activity, the American people have
derived a variety of benefits. Great progress has been
achieved in.perfecting new drugs, new treatments, neW" 1
means of diagnosis, and neW'protections for our people.

The grants of Federal financial assistance are made
on the conscientious review Of applications by dedicated,
competent scientists. The overall programs are laid out
in consultation with respected advisory groups. The
Committees of Congress concerned with these substantial
expenditures periodically appraise the progress registered
and the continuing plans of action.

There are inevitable differences of opinion, of
course, about the worth of such efforts. However, medical
history provides persuasive proof of progress for the
welfare of mankind.because animals could be utilized for
research in many health fields.

Dear Friends:

Thank you for your letter of July 20 regarding H.R. 1839, which
would.provide for the free importation of wild'birds under
-certain conditions, and legislation to prescribe conditions
under which laboratory experiments might be conducted on animals.

YOur comments on these proposals are appreciated and you will

be interested to knOW'that public hearings were held'by the
Senate Finance Committee before H.R. 1839 was reported. From
these hearings it was my opinion that adequate safeguards would
be provided against any inhumane treatment for anfbirds or animals
'brought in under this legislation. YOu may rest assured, however,
that I will keep in mind.your thinking when this bill is taken up
on the Senate floor.

I am not a,member of the Committee handling legislation to prescribe
conditions under which laboratory experiments might be conducted

on animals, and for that reason I do not know what the chances are
for such legislation to be reported to the Senate this session.
Should.this occur, however, you.nmy'be assured.that I will give
every consideration to your position before casting my vote.

Dear Mrs. Gihle:

Thank you for your letter expressing your interest in

legislation which would protect laboratory animals from.needless
cruelty.

I fully sympathize with the purposes of this legislation
and am looking into the possibilities for legislative action i his
field carefully. .As you know, however, no legislation was brought
before the Senate this year which would be of help. I appreciate
knowing of your interest and concern. And I am.hopeful that careful

consideration will lead to constructive action in the next session
of Congress.

With best wishes,

Faithful 1y 9

Dear Mrs. Gesell:

COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS

September 8, 196h

Thank you for your letter eXpressing concern over
the inhumane treatment which is too often accorded

laboratory animals.

I quite agree that adequate standards must be adopted
and maintained. This of course is the aim of several
legislative measures now pending before the Senate Labor
and Public Welfare Committee. I shall convey your interest
to my colleagues who serve on that Committee, because
public interest will be the decisive factor in speeding

action in this area.

Best wishes.

Sincerely,

W

Dear Mr. Reid: ’ 4

Thank you for your letter opposing a provision
of H. R. 1839 which permits the free importation of wild
birds and wild animals for exhibition.

You will be pleased.to know that when.this
measure came before the Senate recently, the wild'bird
and animal section was deleted. The bill is now'back in
the House for approval or rejection of the remainder of
the measure pertaining to beef import quotas.

I appreciate knowing of'your interest in this

subject.
Sincerely,
