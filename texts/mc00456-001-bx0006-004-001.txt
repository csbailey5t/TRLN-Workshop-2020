SEVENTYFOURTH
ANNUAL REPORT

OF THE COMMITTEE
For the Year ended 37st December, 7936.

Work of the Inspectors.

HE five Inspectors stationed in the Branch have
carried out their various duties efficiently and
with tact and it is pleasing to be able to report the
receipt from time to time of letters expressing apprecia—
tion of the manner in which complaints of cruelty
have been dealt with.

The number of convictions recorded during the
year has again exceeded one hundred. There have
been no outstanding cases. The Committee regret
that the trade in British Wild Birds still continues
notwithstanding the provisions of the Protection of
Birds Act, 1933, which makes it an offence to sell,
or offer for sale, such birds other than close—ringed
specimens bred in captivity. As the maximum
penalty in the case of a first offence is, however, only
Two pounds the deterrent effect of the Act is not
great. In a successful prosecution of a Bird Dealer
in Manchester it was revealed that large numbers of
Linnets and other birds were being imported by him
from Holland.

The Branch area has been regularly patrolled by
the Inspectors and the usual watch kept at Markets
and Circuses.

The Fines and Costs for the year amounted to
£235 75. 7d. The heaviest individual penalty inflicted
was £5 and £5 5s. 0d. costs, and one offender was
sent to prison for two months with hard labour.

Cases of Interest heard at the Courts during 1936.

At Salford Police Court a defendant was fined £3
and £1 ls. Od.’ costs for working a horse” in an unfit
state in Trafford Road, Salford, on 31st January, 1936.
A second defendant was fined 53. for permitting the
offence. The animal, an eighteen-year-old brown
gelding, was found working whilst suffering from
Grease and Canker in an advanced state, and appro—
priate measures of treatment were adopted without
delay. (Chief Inspector Booty.)

At Manchester County Police Court a Cattle Dealer
was fined £5 and ordered to pay £5 55. 0d. costs for
travelling a cow and exposing it for sale at Mode
Wheel Cattle Market whilst in a suffering state. The
animal was in an extremely weak and emaciated
condition and was destroyed immediately following
detectionaby the Inspector. (Inspector Edwards.)

At Manchester City Police Court a man was fined
10s. for working a horse in an unfit state at Longsight,
on 24th July, 1936. A second defendant was fined £2
and ordered to pay £1 1s. 0d. costs for causing the
offence. The animal was a total cripple being lame
on both fore legs and was quite unfit for further work.
(Inspector Hillyer.)

In a case at Manchester County Police Court a man
was fined £1 and £1 1s. 0d. costs for working a horse
in an unfit state in Sandy Lane, Stretford on 17th
April, 1936. The animal, which was drawing a bread
van, was found to be suffering from lameness and

arrangements were subsequently made for it to be
treated by a qualified Veterinary Surgeon. (Inspector
Murphy.)

A fine of £1 ls. 0d. was imposed at Eccles Police
Court in a case in which a Bargeman was charged with
working a horse in an unfit state on the canal tow
path at Barton. A second defendant was fined £5
and £2 25. 0d. costs for causing the offence. The
animal was suffering from Chronic Laminitis and was
destroyed prior to the hearing of the case. (Inspector
Curran.)

Dinner to Drovers and Drivers.

This annual event took place on the 9th January,
. 1936, when about 270 men employed at the Mode
Wheel Cattle Market and Abattoirs were present.
During the evening the Branch Chairman presented
two Certificates awarded by your Committee.

We wish once again to thank those who were
responsible for organising the dinner.

Cats’ Shelters.

Try to imagine four miles of cats and you will be
in a position to appreciate the work performed at the
Shelters in putting to sleep 23,815 cats during the
year. Extracts from the Reports kept at each
Shelter would not make pleasant reading but they
would reveal tales of injuries (often, we are afraid,
deliberately caused), neglect and starvation involving
untold suffering until ended at last by a merciful and
painless death.

During the year 806 cats were boarded at the
Shelters whilst their owners were away from home.

Stretford Auxiliary.

Mrs. E. L. Gillett, Honorary Secretary, has again
done excellent work in this Auxiliary and the very
successful Dogs’ Jamborees arranged by her have
become well known local events. Additional lady
collectors are, however, needed in the district and
Mrs. Gillett would be pleased to hear from any who
would be willing to help the cause in that manner.

Urmston Auxiliary.

The work of this Auxiliary continues to be very
satisfactory under the leadership of Miss F. G. Monroe,
Honorary Secretary. The second Annual Dance
organised by Miss Monroe took place in January and
realised the very gratifying amount of 7€30. As in the
previous year the function was held in Flixton and
over 200 people were present.

Prestwich.

In an attempt to enlist new support a Publicity Week
was held in August, 1936, at a shop in Bury New Road,
Sedgley Park. Great interest in the work of the
Society was aroused and the recent publication “ Seeing
is Believing,” pages from which were displayed in the
window, proved of the utmost value in bringing home
to people the need and value of the work of the
Society’s Inspectors.

Educational Work.

In our last Annual Report we mentioned that 105
Education Authorities throughout the country sanc—
tioned talks being given in schools during school hours
by a representative from the Education Organiser’s
Department at Headquarters. This number has now
increased‘ to 117, but Manchester is not included and
is, we believe, the only large city which declines to
afford similar facilities.

On the 6th March, 1936, Chief Inspector Booty gave
an address to the scholars at Old Trafford Senior
Girls’ School and during the first week in April a
Lantern Lecture was delivered to the children of that
school and to those of the Seymour Park Council
School by Captain Cannon, the Society’s Education

Organiser. Both talks were greatly appreciated and
much interest was displayed during the course of the
proceedings. In addition to the foregoing, Inspector
Hillyer gave a lecture to the children of the Open Air
School, Longford Park, on the 6th July, 1936.

Miss Lambert has also during the year given con-
siderable time and attention to the work of the
R.S.P.C.A. Junior Division with respect to the Salford
Schools and has visited a number of schools with a
view to reviving the interest of the teachers. It is '
hoped that a number of new Groups of the Division
will be formed in the near future.

Animal Rescues.

The following awards were made during the year
for the rescue of animals :—-—

Scout G. Dennerley, of the 177th Manchester
Troop, was awarded the Society’s Merit Certificate
for the rescue of a cat from the'River Medlock on
the 16th January, 1936. The Certificate was
presented by the Mayor of Salford on behalf of the
Society during the proceedings at the last Annual
Meeting of the Branch.

Police Constable ” B ” 167 J. E. Jones (Manchester
City Police) was awarded the Society’s Merit Certifi—
cate for gallant conduct in connection with the
rescue of a cat from the River Irk on the 11th
August, 1936. The Certificate was presented by the
Manchester Watch Committee on behalf of the
Society.

A number of other cases of a minor description were
dealt with by the Committee during the year and in
each instance suitable recognition was made“
