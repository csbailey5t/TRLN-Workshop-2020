Notes on Cancer Research.

A n Address by Mr. B. E lsmere given at Lakes/er, :1 />r1'/ l l , I927.

experiments upon living animals were carried out in English

laboratories during that year, and those of us who remember the
returns at the beginning of this century cannot fail to he struck With
the increase of from 50,000 to the present figure. 01' course “1080
figures do not represent the number of experiments upon living animals
carried out in the whole world, breause in most countries, such as
America, Japan, Germany, France, etc., there are no such restrictions
as in our own country.

This system was practised by Galen, and has been developed inter-
m ittently through the successive ages, and it seems a curious commentary
on the vivisectors’ claims to have found the cause and cure of specific
diseases, that after more than 2,000 years since Galen ’s time, they should
still be demanding more victims. .

Of these experiments 199,612 were performed without anaesthetics.
It is the practice of our opponents to gloze over these experiments without
anaesthetics, alleging that they are nothing more than pin—pricks.
This statement appears to satisfy the uninitiated, but those who investi-
gate the subject ﬁnd that the “pin-prick” often means the putting .Of
some loathsome disease into the animal, with the suffering which that
entails subsequently.

In controversy with the pro—vivisector, one generally can learn that
there is “no pain at all,” and also that the “results justify the pain.”

Since the days of Hippocrates, who lived 400 years before Christ, the
medical profession has, Micawber—like, been waiting for something to
turn up, and the general public has settled down to the well-known
Asquithian injunction. As vivisection has proved so sterile in results,
one can only explain the increase in the number of experiments by
assuming that it is the energy of despair.

THE Home Ofﬁce returns for the year 1925 inform us that 209,114

In the year 1882, Professor Koch announced that he had a cure fOF
consumption. The production of this concoction was the fruit of
innumerable experiments upon animals-so many, indeed, that a special
crematorium had to be built in order to dispose of their bodies. The
Press of the European countries heralded this alleged cure, and many
people went from our own country to Berlin. The result was a com—
plete ﬁasco, and one seldom hears of Koch’s Tuberculin nowadays from
the pro-vivisection side. Professor Koch himself said:—-——

“T he. effect of the remedy on man is entirely different from that on
the gulnea-pig, which is the animal usually experimented upon.
Here again is a fresh and conclusive proof of that most important
rule for all experimentalists, that an experiment on an animal gives

small indication of the result of the same experiment upon a human
being.” .

 

 

 




Since Koch’s sday a large number of alleged speciﬁcs for curing con-
sumption have been published by the Piess, all the 1esults of animal
e xperimentation, but the present position with regaid to consumption
is gene1ally summL d up in a lettei to the Brm'sh Medzcal journal, dated
Tanuary 29, 1927, from the Medical Ofﬁcer of Health for Edinburgh.
lhe writer says: —~

“It cannot be emphasised too strongly that up to the present no
speciﬁc cure for consumption exists. Hundreds recover from the
disease, but that is by their own powers of resistance, and these are
increased and strengthened by a hygienic mode of life, by a continual
supply of fresh air, and with abundance of good plain food.”

In the year 1898 there appeared an article in Truth, written by the late
Henry I abouchere upon the then increasing scourge of cancer He
wrote: —~—

“It is a great step to have discovered that the disease is due to a
parasite, and the probabilities are that medical science will, before
long, ﬁnd a means of dealing with it effectively.”

Practically 30 years have now passed since Henry Labouchere wrote
those words, and were he alive to—day, he would see that his conﬁdence
in the system favoured by medical science during that period, has not
been justiﬁed.

During the years 1904 to 1924, 424 ,830 animals have been used in
English laboratories alone for cancer research, and during the same
period the Registrar-General records that the death-rate per 1,000,000
of the population has gone up from 879 to 1,297—in fact, the mortality
from cancer has increased 100 per cent. during the last 35 years.
Hundreds of thousands of pounds have been subscribed for cancer
research, and Sir john Bland-Sutton expressed the feeling prevalent
amongst the public when he said last year:—-~

“Men and women are impatient at the ignorance of medical men
and women in regard to the cause of cancer.” _

l t is true that a few years ago, through the Press, the researchers in
this country announced that they had found that a form of cancer
could be induced in mice by means of irritation. This was looked
upon by many people as an important announcement, but in a book
written by the late Sir Morel Mackenzie, in which he explained his
connection with the illness of the Emperor Frederick of Germany, and.
answered the malevolent allegations that had been brought. against him,
which book was 1:11111li.s11ed in 1888, there can be read the following
statement :~~~ -

“Whether this terrible disease be constitutional or not in its origin,
there can, be no question that the determining cause of its appearance
is, in very many cases, an injury; a condition resulting from .an
injury; persistent application to a particular spot, of something
that gets the tissues inﬂamed Workus in parafﬁn and petroleum
are palticulaily liable to camei of the parts whiLh are habitually
exposet d . ”

And again in the same book:~~--

“Whether it be the lower lip on which the hot stem of a clay pipe
or the smouldering paper of a cigarette is rested day after'day; a
tongue exasperated with the contact of acrid tobacco, etc.”

' 'So that we See an epoch—making discovery to our cancer researchers
is no discovery at all, because it was known and published. before their
series of experiments were started.
Even Voronoff, the Vivisector, indulges in a gibe
“In your country you spend thousands of pounds every year on
cancer research, but your scientist experiments with rats, and if ever
a cancer cure is found in that manner, it will cure cancer in rats, but
not in human beings.”
Here are the ofﬁcial ﬁgures covering 20 years:»~«

Women. The increase continued to be much more rapid for 111011
than for women. Cancer mortality was strikingly constant all.
over the country.”

 

Professor Hastings Giltord (131108., LR .C .P.), recently wrote
that he had made a survey of cancer and continued thus :——

“I do not believe anyone who does this with an open mind can come

to any other conclusion than that to search for the cause or cure of

cancer by means of experiments on lower animals is useless. Time
and money are spent in vain.”

. “Laboratory cancer research having proved a failure and operative
treatment but a limited success, we see no hope of deliverance except
in measures of prevention. And in this direction there is very
lively hope. A, century ago cholera and typhoid fever were regarded
with as much terror as cancer is to—day. Yet though we have never
been able to ﬁnd a cure for either of these diseases we have com—
pletely rid ourselves of the one and are rapidly getting rid of the
other . ”

“Inquiries into the cause of the prevalence of cancer in some
countries and of its rarity in others seem much more likely to provide
us with ways of prevention than our present methods of studying
debateablc forms of tumours grown by artiﬁcial means in the bodies
of inferior animals.”

The present methods of research seem to have had no effect whatever
in ﬁnding either the cause or a possible cure for the very prevalent
complaint which we call inﬂuenza. The British ﬁledz’cal joumal Of
this year states :»_ i

“ No conspicuous advance has been made recently in 0111‘ kHOWlCdgC
of the bacteriology of inﬂuenza. Opinion is still divided between
adherence to the Pfeiffer theory and those who believe that the true
causal agent is some other organism—«probably a ﬁlter—passer. The
present outlook as to the primary causation, therefore, is not P917“
ticularly hopeful. If to know how little we know is the beginnmg
of wisdom, then some progress has been made since the last pandemlC-

We have learnt that our ignorance about. inﬂuenza is even greater

than was supposed . ”

The same is true of the attempts under this method of research to
ﬁnd a cure for diabetes. Claude Bernard carried out very cruel experi—
ments in 1847, and after seven years he said:~—« . ‘

“Our mouths are full of promises, but our hands are (.:mpty of
results.”

From that time until now, many thousands of animals have been
sacriﬁced in the attempt to find a cure for diabetes. The followmg
statistics show that the mortality from the disease between the years
1861 and 1919 increased no less than. 400 per cent.

connection with the use of serums and vaccines. A study of the
Registrar-General’s returns from 1869 to the present date dispels any
illusions one might have as to what has really been the chief factor in
the decline of the mortality from the principal zymotic diseases. When
we investigate these returns, we ﬁnd that the fall has occurred at an
even faster rate in those diseases for which no serum or vaccine has been
used, than it has in those where inoculation or vaccination has been the
method of treatment practised, and often in the case of those diseases,
for the decline of which the serum treatment has been credited, we ﬁnd
upon investigation that prior to the use of any serum or vaccine, the
fall was quite as noticeable and quite as rapid. Thus with regard to
scarlet fever. In 1875, the year of the passing of the Public Health
Act, 851 persons per 1,000,000 of the population died of scarlet fever,
In 1919 only 33 persons per 1,000,000 died. During the whole of the
intervening period there has been a progressive decline, but no serum
nor vaccine has ever been used. We might also point to typhus fever,
which, since the passing of the Public Health Act, has become practically
extinct, although no serum nor vaccine has ever been used.

It is obvious, therefore, that the law insisting upon sanitation, and
the other reforms which the passing of the Public Health Act brought
into English life, are the real causes for the fall in the incidence of the
principal zymotic diseases.

Some vivisectors appear to think that they are exempt from the code
of humanity which the ordinary person observes. Why a highly
educated man should be allowed to do deeds fOr which a navvy or a
carter would be punished, and probably have scathing remarks made
about him by a magistrate, it is difﬁcult for the man in the street to
understand. In the same way, their method of dealing with statistics
has been very deceitful, and they appear to consider themselves above
the rules of honesty which controversialists should observe. Thus an
authority of the RA.M.C. made this statement, speaking of typhoid in
the American Army:~—— .

“Inoculation was made compulsory in 1911 and has practically

abolished the disease.”

A study of the statistics of the American Army shows that the death—rate
had fallen from 9-74 in 1898 to ~10 in 1911, from which it is evident
that the mortality had almost reached vanishing point before inocula-
tion was introduced. To attribute any subsequent decline to inocula:
lion seems very unfair, for why should not the same factors which had
been operative before the introduction of inoculation have. continlied to
be accountable for the decrease?

Our opponents have quoted ﬁgures for the Indian Army, in which
they contrast 600 deaths in. 1897 with 20 deaths in 1912. But what
they do not tell us is that the practice of inoculation was started in 1907,
and that: there had been a 50 per cent. decrease by then. Why do they
also withhold the fact that there was a corresponding decrease in
dysentery and malaria, for which no serum was used at all?

During the last 20 years on three or four occasions the pro-vivisection
school have shown a lowered case mortality for a specific complaint
during the same period that the Registrar-General has shown an
increased death-rate per 1,000,000 of the population. Such an extra~
ordinary anomaly can only be accounted for upon the hypothesis that

a virulent epidemic of the speciﬁed complaint, involving a considerably
increased number of cases, synchronised with the advent of the serum
or vaccine.

It will take a lot to make the ordinary individual believe that such
a coincidence has really occurred.

Although experiments upon animals to ﬁnd cures for those diseases
connected with the thyroid gland have been vigorously pursued since
1838, the mortality from myxeedema showed an increase of 800 per
cent. in 38 years. The Senior Physician at a London Hospital said2-

“It is evident, therefore, that we have not much help in the
explanation of myxredema from the vast amount of experimental
work which has been done.”

This note of failure is very pronounced in the. report of the Research
Council for 1926. We learn that the research with “ﬁlter-passing
viruses”

“Is beset with false hopes and renewed disappointments.”

We are told in regard to encephalitis lethargica and poliomyelitis that

“Almost no progress seems to have been made, in spite of the most
arduous efforts,” ,

and individual leaders of thought in the medical world are now saying
What many people are thinking. Sir, Watson Cheyne said:-—~

“ Just think how many millions of vaccine injections have been made
in the course of the last few years, and in how very few cases we can
deﬁnitely recognise an immediate and marked improvement, as we
ought to if the treatment is to be justified. Think also how often
we are in doubt whether such an improvement as occurs in the course
of the treatment is due to the vaccine, or is only the result of the
actions of the body.”

Sir Thomas Horder said :—-—

“To a large extent the accession of practical interest on the part of

i the doctor (in inoculation) is due to the forcing of his hand by the
patient. Many of us inoculate our patients because it is expected
of us, rather than because we feel it the best way to cure them.”

More recently Sir Almroth Wright has declared:—

“There are very great differences in the effect produced by one and
the same dose of vaccine in the infected as compared with the healthy,
and in the severely infected as compared with the lightly infected.
For this reason, it is impossible to foresee correctly the effect that
the vaccine will produce when inoculated into an untried patient.”
We can quite understand why it was, now, that Dr. Preston King

asked for the use of criminals, because, said he :—

“W e are wandering in the dark.” .

On February 19, 1927, the British M edical'] ownal published a letter
in which occurred the following statement :— . .

“In view of the wideSpread use of speciﬁc protectives 1n the pro—
phylaxis and cure of disease, due, possibly, in no small measure to
commercial exploitation, to the very deﬁnite limits of their useful—
ness, certainly in infective processes, and the positive danger to the
patient from their use, the time would appear to be overdue when an
authoritative pronouncement should be made on the results of such
practices . ”

 




8

In View of these statements we are not surprised that Sir James Barr,
at a meeting of the Liverpool Royal Inﬁrmary this year (1927), stated
that medical science had been at a standstill for a long time. He is a
V ice-President of the British Medical Association, and as the general
public have been wont to believe the exact opposite, largely owing to
the propaganda which is persistently carried on to justify vivisection
as a successful method of research, the Daily M'ail sought an interview
with him for an explanation of his assertion. He said :~-—

“The sufferers from most diseases, including cancer, and diseases
of the heart, are increasing in number, and there are more victims of
pneumonia than formerly. Infectious diseases are held in check by
the work of Public Ofﬁcers of'Health, but otherwise the only disease
which is abating slightly is consumption.”

Is it not time that the general public demanded an inquiry as to
whether the present methods of research, with. its 200,000 animal.
Victims per annum in this country alone, is not scientifically unsound,
as well as being morally wrong?

IS THERE PAIN?

Professor Brletchnikoff said :~—e~“ The very large majority of learned men
feel no scruples in opening the bodies and sulnnitting animals to the most
cruel su'fferii'igs with the object of throwing light on. some scientific
problem. . 7 ”

Claude Bernard said :—~—“ The \i'i\/'isector is a man possessed and absorbed
by a scientific idea. He does not hear the animal’s cry of pain. He

is blind to the blood that ﬂows.”

Professor Pembrey said:~——“I will be perfectly straigl'itforward. The
introduction of an anaesthetic may produce complications. I admit
that I have done painful experiments. If one studies the question of
bleeding and transfusion, it is impossible to give an anaesthetic.”

Dr. Klein admitted that he had “no regard for the sufferings of the
animals.”

Dr. Borel said:~—“I affirm that it is nearly completely impossible to
produce. complete anaesthesia in a dog with any of the known anaesthetics,
such as morphia, chloral, canabis indica, etc. The suffering of the
animals is so great that after the experiment they are completely
stupetied . ”

DID YOU KNOW?

That pressure is being brought to bear upon the Home Ofﬁce to
legalise the handing over of lost dogs (which are. now painlessly destroyed
in lethal chambers) by the police authorities to the physiological
laboratories of this country?

Have you ever seen a dog running wildly about the streets, jumping
up at men and looking into the faces of the people as they pass, - in search
of his master? Do you know of any ﬁdelity which is equal to that of a
dog, and are you willing that these stray dogs who have failed to ﬁnd
their rightful owners should become the; raw material for the
bacteriologist and physiological researcher?
