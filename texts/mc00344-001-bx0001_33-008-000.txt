Dear Miss Stevens,

ﬁe welcome your interest in the purchase of booth
space at our forthcoming annual convention in dash-
ington, D.C. .

Yours is an uncommon request. In the past we have
reserved the available exhibit space for strictly
commercial diSplays of particular interest to the
veterinary practitioner, and for educational exhibits
prepared by active committees of the Association.

de are commonly plagued by lack of sufficient space
and this year is no exception as our reservations

for commercial space have exceeded all expectations.

In as much as your display would introduce a new
factor into our meeting, I hesitate to assume the
aathority for granting your request. In my opinion
this would constitute a matter of policy that should
be determined by the Execetive Board. I would there-
fore request your indulgence for a few days until

I cannascertain their wishes.

Your letter reminds me that our aims are very much

the same, improved scientific care of our animal

friends. In a very real sense, all professional

activities of the small animal practitioner are

directed to humane relief of their ills and suffering.

The first stated objective in the Constitution of

this Association is: ”To provide better veterinary

service and hospital facilities for the diagnosis

and treatment of dogs, cats, caged birds and other
may pets.
