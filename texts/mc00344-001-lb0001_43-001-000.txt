Deer Gretchen:

Thanke for your letter. I am efreié I have been overwhelmed
with corresponﬁemce, for I shoulé have written yea, too.

I em delighted that you plan to be here on Ayril 5th, anﬁ I

am making a mete of it in my tropical rain foreet engagement
calendar which bee a wonderful green and purele frog on the

caver. I hope that beth Roger ane I can come.

Thanks for sending the Genesis Awarﬂ program. It saunas like
a good idea. Steve Wilson, who die the veal calf
documentary, should be in line for an eeerﬁ next year,

I hadn't eeen the animal liberation article, and thanks very
much for sending it. Jim Auchmutey has a very lively style
which should interest reedere. Does the Cemegﬁ ygige have a
wiae circulatien?

SAPL plane to direct its erimary energies to seeking
eaactment of legislation te enﬁ the use ef eteel~jae leghelﬂ
traps. It'e really increéible that 99 Congresses ehoulﬂ have
gone by without acting on this major, long-standing animal
torture. I heye the 130th will get the Snited States level
with the 63 other countries that have banneé this apyalling
trap. Encloeeé is a copy 0f John Oekee’ 0p~E& piece which I
hope will hely get action. Cathy Lise flew up repeateely te
testify at the Suffolk County hearings, anﬁ we are delightee
with the overturn of the County Executive‘s veto of the bill
to ban steel-jaw traps.

Best wishes for the New Year!

Sincerely,

Dear Christine:

Shocking! My files reflect that we've not corresponded since early
Why. Nw, my. Certainly doesn't mean you're not often in my thoughts,
nor does itinean that I don't read your fine newsletters and continue
to be irrpressed with your good work. Regret that we can't see each
other more often, to share thoughts and encouragement! Incidentally,
I've just been booked to do my one—woman concert (”Broadway Greats And
The Songs That Made Them Fanpus” - a tribute to the lady legends of
the musical theatre) at the Smithsonian Institution on Sunday, April
5th. Do notate the date. I'd love you to come if your schedule per—
mits. we'll be in touch about that.

we continue ourinulti—faceted fight here - continuing the lawsuit and
legislation. I have also just accepted a seat on the board of direc-
tors of the new Mountain Lion Preservation Foundation. Decided that
the fate of this magnificent creature, presently in the juggling hands
of the Fish and Game Connission, had to become a priority. They are
considering the lion as a new trophy target! The recently-elected
president of the Foundation is Margaret Owings, and at our firstineet—
ing at her home, she spoke glowingly of you. What an outstanding women
she is. Figures that she would be a friend of yours!

I will probably be involved in the Mrazek pound seizure bill, since you
know how strongly I feel about that issue. Pro—Pets has connﬂtted for
another two years, and will make the federal bill a primary focus.

Thought you'd appreciate the enclosed program and information. I really
believe such an award is long overdue - the media surely holds the key
to opening the minds of the public regarding ourinany animal welfare/
rights issues. It was a very classy and joyous event. The only down
side is that it must now be done annually....fbrever!

I hope this letter finds you and yours prepared for a lovely holiday
season. “_.¢s

WHY A GENESIS AWARD?

PROTESTS. . . .DEMONSTRATIONS. . . .PICKETS. . . . BOYCOTTS. . . .
LITIGATION. . . .NEGOTIATION. . . .CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE. . . .LEGISLATION

All the above are tools being used by the animal rights movement
_to facilitate political and social reform. All routes worthy of
travel, since there is (K) direct line 11) our goals. Different
groups, with different talents, with different methodologies...all
hoping to bring change, hoping to ease the suffering of abused
and exploited animals wherever it occurs.

Educating the public about the plight of animals is the most
important step on the path to progress. Ultimately our efforts
are only as effective as they are communicated by the media to
the public. If no one knows about our picket, what animals have
we helped? If time media comes and subsequently presents the
story unfavorably, what animals have we helped? Thus, it would
seem that the media holds 13K: key to the door (H: a more humane
and civilized society.

The Fund For Animals believes it is time to honor those individuals
in the media whose courage and integrity have increased awareness
and understanding of animal issues. The 1986 GENESIS honorees
were selected for many different reasons - some for their personal

 

commitment, as expressed through statements or writings, others
for having provided a forum within which the subjects of animal
welfare and animal rights could be cﬁscussed, euui still others
for using their creative talents to produce a story in which
these themes could be presented. We are grateful to all our
GENESIS AWARD recipients for their contributions to humane educa—

 

tion of the public.

Why the name GENESIS? Genesis is the book in the Bible which
tells the story of Noah and the Ark, and is, therefore, the first
”news report” of an animal rescue operation. Genesis is also the
word for new beginnings and represents the media's role in awaken—
ing thought to the dignity and the rights of animals. It may be

somewhat trite to say, but it is nevertheless very true that if
these animals could talk for themselves they would all jcun N1
our chorus to say THANK YOU.

 




THE FUND FOR ANIMALS WELCOMES YOU TO
THE FIRST ANNUAL

West Hollywood, CA

The story of Noah and the A rh, which appears in the Book of Genesis,
is the first “news report” of an animal rescue operation. Those who
labor in today’s embattled animal rights movement, and those in the
media who communicate the issues with honesty and courage, are
engaged in writing the genesis chapter of a book which must. . and
will. . climax with universal recognition of the rights, and respect
for the dignity of every creature with whom we share this earth.

THERE IS A W I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT. In it may lie our only
hope of a future for our species! Here is the story of the Hundredth ankey:

The Japanese monkey, Macaca fuscata, has been observed in the wild for a

period of over 30 years. In 1952, on the island of koshima, scientists were
providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkeys liked
the taste of the raw sweet potatoes, but they found the dirt unpleasant. An
18-month old female named Irro found she could solve the problem by washing 1
the potatoes in a nearby stream. She taught this trick to her mother. Her 1
playmates also learned this new way and they taught their mothers, too. 1

1
This cultural innovation was gradually picked up by various monkeys before the l
1

eyes of the scientists. Between 1952 and 1958, all the young monkeys learned
to wash the sandy sweet potatoes to make them more palatable. Only the adults
who imitated their children learned this social inprovement. Other adults kept ,
eating the dirty sweet potatoes. '

Then something startling took place. In the autum of 1958, a certain nurber
of Koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes - the exact nurber is not know.
Let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning there were 99 monkeys on
Koshima Island who had learned to wash their sweet potatoes. Let's further
suppose that later that morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes.

THEN IT HAPPENED!

By that evening almost everyone in the tribe was washing sweet potatoes before
eating them. The added energy of this hundredth monkey somehow created an
ideological breakthrough! But notice. The most surprising thing observed by
these scientists was that the habit ofwashing sweet potatoes then spontaneously
jurped over the sea - Colonies of monkeys on other islands and the mainland troop
of rronkeys at Takasakiyama began washing their sweet potatoes!*

Thus, when a certain critical nurber achieves an awareness, this new awareness may
be comrunicated from mind to mind. Although the exact nurber may vary, the
H.1ndredth IVonkey Phenonenon means that when only a limited nmber of people know

~ of a new way, it may remain the consciousness property of these people. But there
is a point at which if only one more person tunes in to a new awareness, a field
is strengthened so that this awareness reaches alrrost everyone!

fascinating details.)

I'm writing; in connection with an article I'm pro-paring for The iiiwanis E‘Zagazine
on pets and the. problems related to their care and hmdling. In the course

of the preliminary soadework, I've fomd evidence that there is an increasing;
amount of litigation in this area. It occurred to me that you might be able
to answer a few questions about the legal Sid. e of pet oimershizp.

What, for instance, is the Society's stand on the exotic oat business, ospocially
with reference to orivate o‘xmer’ship of such mimals as the largo cats, which
must be de-ufanged and Clo—clawed?

How many st at as have gmiml omt active legislation, and how" many have no ¥W " "

E. S. TURNER

on Food and Drink journalists

HERE are many good reasons why people read the wine
and food columnists.

One: to acquire some arcane knowledge for social occasions
(“You need a bulb syringe, ﬁlled with water: to stop the charcoal
flaring up, old man”);

Two: to correct the misapprehensions of a life-time (“Good
God, Elsie, the Cradocks say gratin has NOTHING WHATEVER TO
DO WITH CHEESE!’-’);

Three: to ﬁnd out what wines to lay down for a godchild (The
T imes’s man is helpful);

Four: to ﬁnd and relish such witticisms as “Stuﬁing is not a
packet of herbaceous reclaimed bread-crumbs stuck up a dead
bird’s recess” (Clement Freud);

Five: to whet the moral indignation on descriptions like
“thrush. .stuffed with foie gras like something out of a medieval
song” (Len Deighton);

Six: to seek out some new, not too ineffable, gastronomic
delight with the serious intention of following the writer 8
instructions, even if it means trying to buy an aebleskiver pan in
Sidmouth and getting in touch with the man in Knobs Hill Road,

E.15, who stocks Bulgarian Troika.
’ Never, perhaps, was so much written about Good Living. To
boost the output still 'further, the Wine and Food Society recently
offered a 100 guineas prize for the best contribution to gastro-
nomic literature (Cyril Ray won it). There is, of course, a Circle of

Wine Writers. All culinary philosophers, one hopes, are practising ‘

cooks; Johnnie and Fanny Cradock blame many kitchen errors
and bug-a-boos' on “the uninformed ﬁddle-faddle of one widely
publicised cookery writer who never fried an egg.” Now who
would that be? i

The Good Life writers live fairly crowded lives. They write
their c01umns or compose their cook-strips, they retire to compile

good food guides or tear off a book about Provencal cookery,
they re-emerge to try out restaurants where peas cost 65 6d, they
look for hairs in the baths of grand hotels, they attend tastings,
they ﬁle dispatches from the wine lands (“1 am staying at
Loudenne, the Gilbey family’s chateau in Médoc”) and they are
always at hand to ﬁll a hole in an advertising supplement. Some
write pétillant stuff in trend—setting organs, others ﬁnd a niche in
monthlies which are more interested in curtains and bathrooms,
or dogs and‘horses. The ideal is to have one column in a quality
Sunday paper and another in a fashionable glossy, like Robert
Carrier, Cyril Ray and Clement Freud. Both media lay on'lavish
coloured still-lifes of anything from a dead duck to a tin of squids
(showing off a little, the Weekend Telegraph illustrated a Jean
Robertson recipe with a two-page study ‘ of a doomed trout
swimming in a ﬂurry of almonds). The Daily Telegraph does not,
as yet, give the Cradocks colour, but if notiﬁed that they are
writing about, say, mayonnaise it very decently orders up
a black-and-white picture of the Surrender of Mahon. Art
deserves art.

Household names among the wine and food philosophers,
besides those already mentioned andhereafter to be mentioned,
include the venerable André Simon (founder of the Wine and
Food Society, author of about forty books), the veteran Ambrose
Heath (author of seventy books and Patsy’s Cook-Strip, Daily
Mirror, 1946-53), Raymond Postgate, Egon Ronay, Elizabeth
David, T. *A. Layton and H. Warner Allen. Among current
columnists, the one who perhaps inspires the grossest envy is
Cyril Ray, whose platforms include the Observer, Queen and
Town. Piecing together a typical .day, or week, in his life, purely
from his writings, is a diﬂicult task. To do justice to certain noble
whiskies, he wrote recently in Queen, he would need a fortnight
away from his desk—“a surcease I_have never yet achieved.” Yet
three months later he wrote in Town: “After seven months of
renewing my acquaintance in Athens, Amsterdam, Vienna and
Rome with the standards by which British hotels must now
expect to be judged, I have been invited to return to my old beat.”

In London one of Mr. Ray’s favourite hotels is the Connaught,
to the restaurant of which. his bank manager occasionally takes
him (this alone shows how grossly he is to be envied). But he says
he cannot afford to stay there, at “six-and—a-half guineas a night
for a single room, plus 135. or so for a bacon-and—egg breakfast;
plus 15 per cent,” except at a magazine’s expense. This may have
distressed those readers who suppose that Mr. Ray has no home

to go to; but of c0urse he has. “In my own home,” he has written,
“I have no complaints about the cooking”———a whimsical under-
statement, for in dedicating a book to his wife he said she had
transformed him from “a bundle of cantankerous bones to a

bushel of contented fat.” At breakfast he is even provided with a\

tiny bottle of German spa water to counteract the saltiness of the
food (or so he explained in the course of an Observer test of
mineral waters, some of which he found “mawkish”).

The highly readable Mr. Ray likes to remember the shining
moments of his drinking career—those splendid cool white wines
served 1n the Ararat, Moscow, by sloe- eyed girls with glossy black
plaits, the old Georgian brandy he sipped in Kiev while trailing
behind Mr. Harold Macmillan and Mr. Selwyn Lloyd. Like every
true oenophile he is happy‘to make converts, as when a fellow-
drinker exclaimed, “My God, Ray, this is what brandy is about!”
He is rightly sharp about the shortcomings of multi-star pull-ups
(no shoehorn was forthcoming at the Paris Ritz), but is indulgent

towards the Cotswold wine waitress who tells him the Bern- ‘

casteler Riesling is “super—and such a pretty bottle.” Those, if
any, who think Mr. Ray stuck—up should know that he wants to
see port-and—lemon revived as a smart summer drink. A sound

man, Mr. Ray; so let us all transfer our newly broached ﬁnos (so
sensitive to air) into half-bottles, to please him.

Robert Carrier, of the Sunday Times and Vogue was reared on
old- fashioned pot smells in up- -state New York. He went to live
in Paris at 22, having lost his stomach to France while with the
Ofﬁce of Strategic Servicean Britain, he laments, to “know how
to eat” means to know how to behave at table; “most of us will
end up having had very few memorable meals.” Mr. Carrier
remembers his good meals all right—or'does he enter them in a
diary “.7 He remembers “a lazy Sunday morning barbecue breakfast

_ served years ago on a noble terrace just outside New Orleans”——a

little matter of shrimp gumbo and creamy scrambled eggs, bar-
becued pompano with a delectable creole sauce, and peaches in
champagne. Breakfast was preceded by mint juleps, which
Clement Fieud unclemently dismisses as “lambless alcoholic
mint sauce. ‘

The reader who is eager to embrace the characters of Mr.
Carrier’s favourite bistros may shy at mention of Monsieur D———,
“who welcomes you with charm (or turns you away as! the fancy.
takes him).” Yet even Monsieur D may be preferable to the
English restaurateur who, as Len Deighton complains, spends
his time giving ﬂowers to the ladies and lending the men greasy
ties instead of working in his kitchen.

In the course of a recipe for food a la Grecque Mr. Carrier
mentioned that the Greek style of cooking had come to his house
to stay in the person of Yanni, a house-boy from the/island of
Syra. No doubt Yanni acts as barbecue boy at Mr. Carrier’s
fetes champetres. Nothing complicated about them, really; just
some ﬁsh, skewers of lamb, beef or pork, a casserole of fruits de
mer and another of beef in burgundy, with a make—it- yOurself
salad. “Huge platters of assorted cheeses and fruits and a tub
ﬁlled with iced wines complete this easy entertaining pattern,”
says Mr. Carrier, modestly. If you suggest that he is putting
himself out, he consoles himself with the thought that cooking is
a selﬂess art because it is the least enduring.

On one or other of his platforms Mr. Carrier 1s often joined by
Hugh Johnson, editor of Wine and Food, who reminds the reader
not to waste full-bodied wines like Cha‘teauneuf du Pape on Mr.
Carrier’s midnight guests. Such wines \provide inspiration for '
grave‘dissertation, not gay badinage. (Compare Edmund Penning-
Rowsell in Country Life: “ . claret is an intellectual wine, for
it encourages comment, recollection and comparison”) .

Observer and Town, and is himself a restaurateur of pride and
prejudice. “Unless you are Very, very rich,” he warns, “you
cannot afford to give your guests inexpensive food,” but he is
willing to teach how to make dogﬁsh taste like, at least, halibut.
He thinks “the sturdy post-myxomatosis rabbit” an under-rated
and economical delicacy. Instead of bemoaning what technolo-
gists have done to our food, he suggests ways- of making eggs,
chickens and ice-cream edible. Even c11rry does not have to be
“something hot that is poured over something nasty.” It is rather
. fun to ﬁnd Mr. Freud telling Town’s playboys how to make
bread—and butter pudding, assuring them that “there is some-
thing about the blandness of soggy bread, the crispness of the
golden outer crust and the unadulterated pleasure of a lightly set
custard that makes the world seem a better place to live in.”
(Compare a Vogue writer’s recent endorsement of tinned
porridge)

Mr. Freud likes to watch people eating. In a Lyons Corner _

House he studied a man who ate a Wimpy, a Whippsy and a
Banana Pretty, plus “one-quarter of the contents of a plastic

tomato” and two-thirds of a napkin enclosing a roll. This put
Mr. Freud in mind of Brillat'—Savarin, who said, “Tell me what a
man eats and I will tell you what he is.” F or. once Mr. Freud was
unable to come up with the answer.

Columnists like to outline what they call “undernanding”
dinner parties—undemanding on the hostess, that is. For a
splendidly demanding dinner party one must turn to Wilshaw, of
the Queen, who recently described a. three-course diner intime to
be planned “with love, or in the expectation _of it.” He appeared
to be addressing himself to men, but women were not speciﬁcally
warned off. Instructions included “clean the, quail and place
three oysters in each, spread the pate’ on to the Parma ham and
wrap each bird in a slice and tie,” and “with a knife and a soup _
spoon scoop the oranges out clean and butter the insides of the
skins . . . a maddening job.” Most of the work could be done the
day before, explained Wilshaw; expectation, no doubt, would
keep the chef going. When Wilshaw made his debut, he was said
to have survived cooking for Frenchimarshals and a four-power
conference at Berlin. He is not too grand to eat whelks and
mussels. The mussel, he says, is not the poor man’s oyster; rather
is the oyster the rich man’s mussel. But it was oysters he put in
those quail.

In the Daily Telegraph the Cradock team, of television and
other fame, write as “Ban Viveur,” which accounts for such
peculiar headlines as “Ban Vivear Come Back From Their
Travels.” The Cradocks claim to have been taught to taste-by
superbly discerning, autocratic grandparents. “Their tables were
magniﬁcent . . . Neither of us ever knew until we went to English
boarding-schools that rice was cooked with a tarpaulin 0n the
top.” Nor did they know that jams, jellies, sauces and chutneys
came in bottles with printed labels. The Cradocks’sv enthusiasm is
infectious. But how many of their fans have nipped out to buy a
packet of porridge oats on which the live mussels can pasture?
Buying food for one’s food is a bit much, some may feel. Among
the Cradocks’s dislikes are mince, big fat marrows, spaghetti
served up looking like bleached worm casts, old dripping, icing
pumps, idle greengrocers and the “unhealthy chi-chi” which goes
with crépes suzette in restaurants. They like demolishing super-
stitions and excuses. Bang the oven door as hard as you like,
they say, it won’t cause the souﬁ‘lé to sink.

On lobsters, the Cradocks say: “Your tender heart will not be
agonised by screaming lobsters if you cook them kindly. Place in
cold water and bring slowly to the boil. This way they merely
become drowsy . . .” The Universities’ Federation for Animal
Welfare say the kind way is to plunge lobsters straight into
vigorously boiling water. Somebody’s wrong. Wilshaw in his hot
lobster tart recipe urges the “non-squeamish” to dispatch the live
lobster with one bold knife stroke.

Occasionally the Cradocks seem to be addressing a rather
specialised reader. “If you have ﬁshed,” their Cook’s Book
says, “through the long daylight ‘nights’ of Lapp midsummer
at a lakeside pool below a waterfall with Lapp Chieftains,
gathered juniper branches with them, made a smoke chimney for

' freshly caught, newly gutted salmon and eaten the 'ﬂesh in your

ﬁngers, you will know fresh ﬁsh.” But when the time comes they
bravely face up to'instructing girls in single rooms how to cook
in a portable oven over a gas-ring. ,

Not all gastronomic writers remember the challenge of the

single gas-ring. What can you do (they say, perhaps) with a

million unadventurous spinsters afraid to admit live lobsters into
their bed-sitters ‘?

hear Christine Stevens:

Thanx for yours of the 5th. It was grad to hear from your corner.
I rather thought I'd never hear from you again. I think it can
be said that my last letter wasn't too diplomatic.

Diplomatic or not, it is plain that the results would have been
the same: ho pictures. (he tickie, no shirtie.) And, frankly, I can
understand your end of it.

Ies, it is too bad that matters must end on this low note.
admittedly, I am the heavy in this drama. I am largely responsible
for the misunderstanding. For this I am sincerely sorry.

In mitigation, let me say that I 'overreacted' because of the great
need of photography for a prospectus. Like previously stated in
other letters, a pictorial starts with the photography. @he text
rather develops around it. Hot intirely. nut layouts and such are
considered at the beginning. There are many more reasons why

photos are so necessary at the initial stage. In my case, I find

it much better to first get a publisher and then do the book. This
saves a lot of time and usually produces a better work. No publishef
would consider such a book without first looking over the available
photography. This is basic. -— So, I lost my cool when I saw it all
acing down the drain because I couldn't come by the phttos.

And down the drain it is! Please believe that I am not trying reverse
psychology to get you to reconsider. I can tell by your tone that you
are adamant in this respect. Ehat your word is final.

Fell, it isn't entirely the fact that you refuse to cooperate this
way; it is also that the other societies have not been very helpful
this way, even the ones that have tried. I have those from that
Catholic outfit, but not enough; hr. horse has been cooperative.

But the humane society really doesn't have much. In fact, what they
sent I can't use. I'see, the key photos they finally sent were

just copies off brochures with the engraver's dots. Even so, they
are small and wrinkled since they were sent without cardboard
protection. They are usdiess for my purposes. rlease understand

that this is not criticism of these peeple and institutes that tried,
but only to show the gap betwixt the book intended and the necessary
phttography.

—— I really thought we were communicating and that you did know
'substantially' what the intended publication would be. Fride being
what it is, I thought my background and credentials sufficient to
convince you that I wruld not be extreme.

Gene L0V'tz 2/E'~‘Eiss iiﬁhristine 5::3tevens

the sad thing is that the book would have been very close to the
views er the Animal welfare Institute. I QMncﬂathought too close, and
that such might vex you; that you and others would conclude that

I merely edited and/or copied your material. It even crossed my

mind that a collaboration with the Institute might be the way.

I know what scares you. You are afraid that I will come out
against all vivisection. That I might take some extreme
doctrinarian and idealogical view that s uld not be compatahle
with the converts and supnort you seek. sure, I would move against
redundant and stupid and cruel experimentations; but I would be

in favor of valid medical research. I might strike out against the
one or 30rd in some instances, but I would not move against the
worthwhile research methods nraoticed under clean and humane
conditions.

eh, it begins to sound like I an be h doing the book, or that I

am trying to convince you and get you to reconsider. so, I an only
endeavorins to and things on the proper note. selieve me, I have
thrown in the towel. One can whistle i’ the dark just so long.

It is a closed issue with me. I cannot compound futility any
longer. In is wise to know when to give up.

I want to thank you for your solendid help. All has been deeply
anoreciated. As to the help your conscience would not allow you

to give, I understand. I mialt have have done the same if
nositions were reversed.

. . To tell the truth, you should do the book. You can get
“icturesi You are in nosition. You are on the inside track. Really,
any not give it a whirl??? God knows such a book is needed. B’sides,

would get a vicarious enjoyment and satisfaction out of it. I any
.ure our animal friends would anoreciate same. “

MAX SIEGEL. Executive Director

Dear Friend:

In the broadest sense, Carl Sandburg was America. CARL SANDBURG,
A Pictorial Biography, by Gene Lovitz and Joseph Haas tells that story. The
book will be published on September 11th.

It's a beautiful book about an American century and about one of

 

the greatest men of that century, a moving tribute in memorable prose and
magnificent photographs.

CARL SANDBURG, A Pictorial Biography, is an American Saga, for it
is the story of a life that spanned nine decades, a life that developed as a
country matured, reflecting the needs and goals of the nation. Through a
childhood in Galesburg, Illinois, as the son of poor Swedish immigrants, through
boyhood when he listened to the men who had known and worked with Abraham Lincoln,
through the hobo years, the college years, the newspaper years, the Lincoln years
when in seclusion he wrote his four volume work on the civil war president,
Lovitz and Haas have provided a full bodied portrait of one of America's
greatest men.of letters, Carl Sandburg. The book was painstakingly researched
and contains some information about the early years that even Sandburg was vague
about. Rich in interesting detail and anecdotes, the book contains over 185
photographs of which almost half have never before appeared in print.

Gene Lovitz is a Chicago photographer with a national reputation.
Joseph Haas is a widely known feature writer for the Chicago Daily News.

Memphis

495 UNION AVENUE
MEMPHIS 1. TENNESSEE

Testimony by Kay Pittman, Memphis Press-Scimitar Staff Writer,
in Support of Legislation, S. 2322 and S. 3059,
to Curb Stealing of Dogs and in Support of Humane Laboratory Research Practices.

Following up on reports and pictures taken by officials of the Memphis
Humane Society, photographer Jim Reid and I went to Ripley, Miss., on Monday,
March 7, to look over the first Monday trade day there. Tips from the Humane
Society and some pictures taken indicated to our editor, Charles Schneider,
that there was something not quite right about the dog sale there.

We, however, did not expect to see anything like we saw at Ripley. I,
for one, was horrified. Dog sale is not the word for it. Dog slaughter per-
haps would be. There were nearly 1,000 dogs at the trade day. Some, of course,
were “legit” dogs-~those that belonged to the owners. These could be spotted
immediately. There was one man selling one dog, or perhaps, two. These people
would ask $25 to $50 for the dogs. These "legit" dogs made up about 10 per cent
of the total number of animals there.

Although everything from fishing tackle to grandfather clocks is auctioned
or traded, the biggest single commodity at Ripley is dogs. I would judge that
about half of the dogs there were stolen pets.

We arrived at the Ripley Fairgrounds, on the outskirts of town, about 8:30 a.m.

Trucks~~large ones--were pulling in. Some had triple-tiered stacks of cages. These

big trucks, I learned, belonged to the big dog dealers-~those who buy from the

 




-2-

sellers and in turn sell to the research labs. Pick up trucks, filled with small
wire cages in the backs, started arriving with sometimes forty dogs or more.

Other men came in old cars with dogs in their trunks. One car trunk, completely

unventilated, held about twenty dogs. Some were big dogs, like collies, and they

were crammed and bent double.

Out of such a trunk I saw a magnificent looking black collie with a shiny
coat and thoroughbred lines come out. A child walked by and patted the dog on
the head. fhe collie leaped to run after the child. That's when a rope attached
to a long steel prodding bar was tightened to the strangulation point around the
collie's neck, jerking the dog upward. His tongue hung out, and the dog made y
gagging noises. Then the steel bar came down hard on the dog's nose, and blood
sourted from the wound. The dog was sold for $5 to a dog dealer. He was loaded
into a truck that was so crammed and filled with dogs by noon that it didn't seem
possible to stick another one into it. But more were. By late afternoon the
three-tiered truck, with cages so small there wasn't room for the big dogs to
stand up, held almost 200 dogs and a great number of cats. The cats and puppies
were brought to the dealers in big burlap sacks that were tied at the top. They
were dumoed on the ground. I saw one of the dealers step on the burlap bag. He
didn't look down to see how many animals in the sack were squashed or for that
matter look into the bag. But before long, blood stains appeared on the bag,
seeping through.

Some of the men freely admitted to me that they scoured the countryside pick~
ing no does. Pets. It was easy to tell that all were not unwanted dogs-~there were

many Dalmatians, Collies, German Shepherds, and so on, particularly'beagles, among

the scores of animals.

 




-3-

The men who have scores of dogs in their trucks never seem to get more than
$5, most from $1 to $3 for the dogs bought by the dealers.

When the trade day opened, the trucks, many of them panel trucks, started
arriving with chicken wire cages only big enough to hold one dog. Sometimes
these cages held twenty dogs.

I caught a glimpse of one dog bearing a Kentucky license tag. I saw a man
remove the license from him. Almost all the dogs there had some sign of blood
on them, mostly cut noses where they had been beaten or stuck with these steel
prodding bars so much in evidence with the dealers and sellers. I saw dogs
beaten, kicked and tied out behind cars and along fences for hours without food
or water. The dealers' trucks again had no food or water. I asked one dealer,
who of course didn't know I was a reporter, what would happen to the dogs on the
truck. The dealer said the dogs would stay on the truck during the whole process
from Ripley onward, without food, water, or exercise.

I particularly am unable to get one dog out of my mind and have been haunted
by visions of it. It was a pregnant boxer, looked like it had reached about time
for delivery. One dealer bought it and took a steel prodding bar and jammed the
dog in the stomach and then threw it up into the top—most part of the truck. I
know that the dog would probably have puppies before reaching the dog farm or
hospital destination. There wouldn't be room in that truck for the poor dog to
lie down and have the puppies, and I know the puppies would be squashed if they
could be born at all. I suffered for the agony I knew that poor animal was going

to have to endure and the horrible death the dog would probably have facing it.

Perhaps only a woman could project that much into a dog, I don't know, but I did

and do. And I think most women would and probably most men.

 




-4-

I saw a couple of good lookinquiredales there, as well as a fine looking
and expensive white German Shepherd. The Shepherd was sold to Roy Hargrove of
Medina and loaded on the Hargrove truck, which bears a Cicero, Illinois, sign
on its three-tiered side. That truck was so crammed with animals by noon that
you couldn't have squeezed a squirrel into it. Yet more dogs were thrown into
it.

Following the publication of the Ripley article, on Thursday, March 10,
with horrifying pictures, our phones at the paper and mine at home literally
started ringing off the hook. It was like Pearl Harbor. More than 1,000 calls
were received by the paper, and I received hundreds of letters.

Among the calls were many tips. Hundreds of people told me of seeing "men
dressed in old clothes with trucks going into neighbors' yards and taking their
dogs out of front yards." Just scooping up pets for sale and throwing them into
cages behind pick up trucks.

I had a report that similar sales go on the second Monday of every month
at the trade day in Pontotoc, Miss., and the first Monday of every month in
Trenton, Tenn.

Jim Reid, the photographer, and I, complete with concealed camera and this
time me wearing a blonde wig (my hair is normally black) went to the Pontotoc
sale. There was little activity there. 'We were told by some of the men that
"the big dog men won't be showing up today, won't be many dogs here, because
we're expecting to see those reporters any time now." I saw only two dog sellers

that I recognized from the big Ripley, Miss., sale. Both drove trucks with

Tennessee license plates. Both made frequent trips to their pick—ups which,

were covered by a metal arrangement. From within this "tent" they would pull

 




-5-

out some dogs--mostly hounds--for sale. One offered to sell me a coon hound for
$1.

It was a rainy day, a bone-chilling and cold one. A pitiful sight was two
pretty Airedales, offered to me for $15, left out in back of a pick-up truck.
They were chained to the side of the truck, shivering and the rain beat down on
them all day long.

The man who had the Airedales had pulled them snarling and fighting into
the auction bar and trade area. Another man told him he had better get "those
dogs out of here, unless you want to get in trouble." Meaning, of course, that
"those reporters" might be there. I asked the "Airedale man“ if the dogs were
registered and if he had the papers on them. He said, "Yeah, they're registered.
I don't have the papers on me but I can get them if you want the dogs. They
belong to someone in Tupelo."

A man from Houlka, Miss., and his young son were going all around looking
in trunks and cars and pick ups. They were searching for their two beagles
which disappeared the week before. The man said, "One of these dognappers has
got my dogs. I wouldn't have taken $100 for those dogs. I'm going to search
all day until I find them. I've had seven good dogs disappear in the last year
and I'm fighting mad and plenty tired of it."

James M. Daniels of 5509 Benjestown, Memphis, Tenn., who lives near the

Shelby Forest area, said he recovered his missing coon dog Sunday, March 13. he

said, "It's getting fierce in the Shelby Forest area. As fast as we turn around

someone is stealing our dogs. They sell them out of state if they can for good

prices."’

 




-6-

Daniels said he went to Covington, Tenn., where a dog sale and trade is held
each Sunday morning at an auction barn, and spent the morning looking for his dog.
He said he saw a Missouri dog dealer, who didn't have a license on the back of

his car, with a load of fourteen dogs, one of which was a red bone hound. "we11,

I went that afternoon to South Memphis on a dead end of Nora Street where dog

trades are held each Sunday afternoon, and saw that dealer again. He had put
the Missouri license plate on his truck by then. .And that red bone hound was
lying dead in the back of the truck. It had died between Covington and South
Memphis.“

Daniels said he heard from friends that because of the publicity in The
Press~Scimitar that the dealers and sellers were "running scared and turning
some of the dogs loose, especially the real 'hot' dogs that might be recog-
nized." he said someone told him his dog had been turned loose in Tipton
County, Ienn., and he went up to search for it and found the_dog. Daniels
said he and his friends have lost "lots of dogs lately; some have been swiped
out of our front yards."

Following the publication of the “Nora Street information," a middle-aged
woman, hrs. Ola Cooper and her sonpin-law, L. C. Thornton and daughter, Jean,
of Memphis, went to Nora Street Sunday, March 20, in search of Mrs. Cooper's
pet cat. Mrs. Cooper had reason to believe it had been swiped by these animal
stealers because she found "cat traps" located on a vacant lumber yard in her
neighborhood.

She said there were about six cars and trucks there loaded with dogs.
Some of the men told her they would have plenty more "as soon as the big man

comes. He's on his way." The man turned out to be the Missouri dealer, with

the name Gene willie on the side of the truck. He had a two-tiered truck that

 




-7-

he pulled dogs out of. Nora is a dead end Street and these transactions were
handled on the county street, and are each Sunday afternoon. The Missouri man
accused the woman and her son-in-law of being reporters and started using abusive
language to them and telling'them to leave. Thornton said the street was public
and they had a right to stay. But they got scared, left, and called the Shelby
County Sheriff's Department. The sheriff's men arrived, went into the street to
talk to the dealers and sellers, and came back on the road and told Mrs. Cooper
and her son that they would have to leave because the dealers and sellers said
"they were disturbing the peace and had started everything." Mrs. Cooper said,
"All I wanted to do was try to find my cat."

In a letter dated March 17, I received this from Eddie Morgan, Rt. #1,
300 Linda Drive, Clinton, Miss., (a city near Jackson, Miss.).

He wrote:

"I recently read the article on the Ripley, Mississippi dog sales in the
March 10, 1966 edition of your paper. I have always been proud of Mississippi
but the existence of such a thing has diluted this pride a great deal.

"I recently had two bird dogs mysteriously disappear and I have not found
them. I found that the Medical Center, Jackson, Miss., used approximately'uoo

to 600 does per month. These dogs are supplied by M. L. Little of 1350 Bailey

Avenue, Jackson, Miss., and Hollie Vanlandingham of Vardaman, Miss., according

to testimony given at the trial on March 15, 1966.

"It so happened that I had to file an affadavit against M. L. Little for
failure to provide proper food and water for the dogs he had in'a pen near
Jackson because the law enforcement officers refused to even investigate the

situation. The trial was on this date and the County.Attorney, District

 




-8-

Attorney nor any state official helped prosecute this man but a Health Department
official testified for the defendants. .After the trial I found that the judge
had drawn up a lease for M. L. Little whereby he leased the space for his dog

pen from the other defendant: The lease was drawn in December of 1965 so the
judge was aware of the entire situation ahead of time.

"When I found M. L. Little's dog pen with forty to seventy dogs in it without
any container for food or water, I was astounded. The next day another man was
with me and we found some of the dogs actually eating a freshly killed brown
colored Chow.

"It is an understatement to say that Mississippi has inadequate humane laws.
There seems to be a lack of common decency. The paper in Jackson, Miss., will
not print anything adverse regarding the medical center. It is not necessary to
say how the trial ended. M. L. Little testified that he bought the dogs at the
City Kennels at Laurel and Meridian, Miss., for $1.00 each and fed them two pounds
of dog feed each day for 17 days, plus paying a man to drive his truck $8 per day.
ﬁe also testified that he bought old bread to feed them and then sells them for
au.oo to 35.00 each. He has been doing this for six years. I am too ignorant to
figure out how he makes money at this one as an occupation but maybe it is just
my ignorance. This is just a small portion of the pitiful conditions that exist.
Please feel free to print any of this information. Any suggestions as to how this

condition can be remedied would be appreciated." Signed, Eddie Morgan.

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Thank you for your letter letting me know about the photos.

1 will write H. Neuman and Company. Thank you for the address.

1 do hope you can locate the dog cage photo, will hold that plate open
in case you do locate it. In the mean time, Pet Pride has given me
permission to use any of their advertisements, so can always find a
suitable replacement from that source. Still, will hold it open for
the cages. Will write you if your photo does not arrive before the

book is ready to be sent off.

I have only 14 photos to locate now, so things are coming to a close
fairly rapidly.

Again, thanks for letting me know about the photos.

Very truly yours,

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Instead of my copying out sections of Mr.
Knittel's letters, I am sending them to you.
Will you be kind enough to return them.to me,
please, when you have read them.

As you will see, he and his firm.have de-
cided not to publish the book -- the title of
which I have changed to THE CRIMSON CAGE.
However, it is the closest I have come to being
accepted, and I am.grateful, most grateful to
you for having brought it to his attention, and
to him for the time and thought he has put in
on the subject.

We have been very busy recently moving back
here from the Vineyard and getting a child off
to boarding school, so I had not had time until
today to reply to his kind suggestion of giving
the book to a literary agent. Naturally, I
have accepted his offer. I hope he will understand
about my delay in answering, which I eXplained
in my letter, because I think it most generous
of him.to be willing to carry the matter any
further. '

Sincerely,

Dear Ms. Stevens

Thank you for the photo. I will return it after it has been returned
to me by the publisher.

I did get the photo—~a nice large 8 X 11 I think it was, from the
company you suggested. Right now I forget the name of the company
and the correct spelling of the stereotaX instrument-—if that is
close enough for you to know what I mean.

I suppose I did not make it too clear——but the book has not been
accepted yet. I wanted to have all the photos before sending it to
a publisher.

However, I feel it would be off to the publisher by January at the
very latest—~and I should have some word within 4 months after that.
ye Soon as I learn I will let you know.

Thank you so much for your help. I do appreciate it.

Very truly yours,

Miss Christine Stevens, Secretary
Society for Animal Protective Legislation
745 Fifth Avenue

New York, New York 10022

Dear Miss Stevens:
Thank you so much for your letter of August 13th.

Since I last wrote, I discovered that I will not need
the illustration of the man hosing out the cage.

However, I would still like to use the photograph of
the dog cages and the photo of the stereotaxic instrument.
Since you mentioned you will send the photo of the dog
cages, I will hold that position open.

When you send the advertisement for the stereotaxic
instrument I will see if it will dUplicate well on a
Xerox Machine and if it does will send the original ad
back to you immediately. If it does not duplicate well,
could I please keep the advertisement until the publishers
are finished with it? It would probably be several months——
but I would return it to you as soon as the book was in
print and the photographs and other items returned to me.

Also, when using the advertisement, how should I go
about giving the photo credit so as to avoid any type of

lawsuit? I would appreciate your advice on this matter.

Thank you for your help, and I will look forward to
your next reply.

Very truly yours,

'430 Prospect Ave.,
Mt.Vernon, N.Y. 10553

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

Of course, you've given me up for lost, long ago:
(I wrote the article about "They Help Make Compassion Mandatory",
which you so kindly helped me iron out). And I have nothing constructive
tO'report yet about it, but I have been feeling conscience-smitten
about not writing you for so darned long that for my own peace of mind
I've got to give you a run~down on what little I was able to do, and
where we stand. 1

After you went over the article for me, I sent
queries to every magazine I knew that might print that sort of subject.
This included Pageant, Coronet, Redbook, True, even the N.Y.Times Mag.
ixﬁinxiiyx (Most of them sent a nice letter, not a form reject, which
may indicate the subject wasn't entirely taboo.)

Finally I wrote Alice wagner, as you'd suggested,
and got an awfully nice letter back, saying they couldn't use anything
that long, but She was most interested in your work and someday wished
she could do an article on you and your work. Unfortunately by that
time my toy business was so timenconsuming that I didn't even have time
to write and.thank her for her letter, let alone hazexiimnxxnxre—work
the article again. That's my main problem - lack of time. For I'm
still too much of an amateur to be able to tackle writing on the side
while also doing the exhausting work needed to keep our toy business
geing.

And in addition to lack of time, the writers course
I was taking was already nearly one year overdue ~ I Spent so much
of my time on yhe Humane article and queries that I didn't have a chance
to do my last lesson of the course ~ which was to write the beginning
of a book, no less! Fortunately, the course allowed me an extra year
to complete my work, gratis, and I finally got the lesson in - the last
day of that extension. Since then I've been trying to get the book
licked into shape to submit to an editor (it's a sort 9f guide book,
and if I could ever get it published I wouldn't have to worry about ‘
lack of time ~ I could be my own boss.) But simultaneously, I was
ill from Jan. until June, and couldn't do much of anything. I did want
to go on trying to get your article into any kind of magazine at all,
and I wanted to follow up Mrs.Wagner's suggestions ~ but I simply
could not. If it's any source of hope, I did get an article published
by Ford Times (due in this July issue) and Yankee‘s buying another.
Not much help to you, but everything I get published should make another
article easier. And I haven't given up yet on yours.

I was going to suggest to Mrs. Wagner that pehhaps
you could supply information for a monthly column in her magazine
(since her readers are interested,but there's no space for long articles)

5)

 




so peOple would get some continuous account of how things are in

your department. Sometimes if they read just one article, they might

be quite affected by it, but before they do anything about the problem
along comes another article on the plight of the Korean orphans, or the
vanishiagegrets — and they're off on another tangent. But by seeing

a monthly progress report on how their gun letters are (or aren't)
helping your cause might give them a more continuous interest.

I'll still keep the article about your work waiting in the Wings,
though it would now have to be updated somewhat. If you ever hear of
anyone who might want it or any part of it, I‘ll be only too glad to
let you have it. I made a number of changes in it after you criticised
it for me a year ago, and I think it has good possibilities for being
a really intriguing article - excepting that it can't find a publisher!

Meanwhile, I do hope things are going well in your own work and
I am in hopes that someday I can do some small part to help it along.
Our Christmas toy rush is beginning to rear its head, which means I'm
not likely to be of much use for awhile..However, should you ever
hear of someone needing an article like mine, I'd drop things in a
hurry, at least long enough to rewrite it along Whatever lines seem
best.

With deep apologies for the delay in writing you, 1 am

Sincerely yours,

Lida Newbe y

Dear Mrs. Stew ns,

In March I wﬁote a.n article for you entitled
"Why Do You Pay For Cruelty?” As of yet, I
have received no word a.s to whether the piece
was accented or not I do not receive PEN
and if my article was oublished I would”
aopreciate a copy of the magazine.

If the article has not been nublished yet,
it is anorohriate, after three months, to send
the editor a. note reminding him of it.

I en1oyed soina the niece for you and I hone
to be of service again in the future. Currently
I am being Dublished in the Aquarium and Pet Li.
magazines. Ihese articles are not specifically
on cruelty, but they rather instruct hobbyists
on how they may best care for their nets. I
feel this instruction nrevents unnnowing cruelty
on the oart of pet owners, too.

Keen up your good work, and I hope to hear
from you soon.

Dear Ms. Sterens:

Thank you for the corrections you made to the manuscript
and thank you, too, for the permission to use it. I only wish
I could give more support than just a section in a book or a
letter to Washington.

I noticed you sent a copy of the leaflet I mentioned in my
first letter. I suppose I did not make my request for photo—
graphs very clear.

If it is possible, can you send me a photograph of the cat
captioned "Photograph from an advertisement for a stereotaxic in—
strument." and the photograph showing stacked dog cages in a base—
ment.

I am afraid the photographs would not reprint very well from
the leaflet. I think the illustration from the work manual will
duplicate fairly well. However, I would need the actual photographs
of the other two photographs. It would be most helpful.

I will be looking forward to your reply——and hope the photos
are available.

Very truly yours,

I HAVE READ WITH GREAT INTEREST SOME OF YOUR LITERATURE
SEINC DISTRIBUTED AT THE HUMANE SOCIETY EXHIBITION AT THE
NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR.

I AM A WRITER CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN THE PREPARATION OF
AN ARTICLE ON SOME ASPECTS OF THE RESEARCH WITH ANIMALS.
GOING ON AT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

IT WAS OF ESPECIAL INTEREST TO ME TO LEARN THAT SO
MUCH OF THE EXPERIMENTATION IS FEDERALLY SUPPORTED AND THAT
THE FINDINGS OF THE EXPERIMENTS ARE DIRECTLY USED BY PRIVATE
INDUSTRY FOR GREATER SAFETY-~AND PROFITS.

A REFERENCE TO YOUR TESTIMONY BEFORE A HOUSE SUBCOM-
MITTEE AROUSED MY INTEREST. THE ARTICLE, HOWEVER, NEGLECTED
TO MENTION BEFORE WHICH COMMITTEE, THE DATE, AND ITS REL—
EVANCE TO WHICH PENDING BILL.

I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY CLARIFICATION YOU CAN GIVE ME.
IF I CAN LEARN WHERE AND WHEN THESE HEARINGS TOOK PLACE, I
WILL SE ABLE TO SECURE A COPY FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF

WITH MANY THANKS FOR ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME.

Miss Christine Stevens, Secretary

Society for Animal Protective Legislation
7h5 Fifth Avenue

New York 22, New York

Thank you, Miss Stevens,

...for taking the time to write us as you did on February 18
concerning an article for PEN Magazien. Mrs. Holt's concern
is appreciated.

I believe that an article such as you describe, to be written

on proposed legislation to require humane treatment of experi-
mental animals would be of value and perhaps further this very
important cause. If you would like to submit such a story for
our consideration, on speculation only, we'd like to take a look
at it with the possibility of using it in a forthcoming issue of
PEN.

We would in no way wish the article to be based on a scrutiny of
our earlier article. Mr. Hall is a very fine, and competent
writer, and we do not feel that his story needs any apology.

He presented a honest picture of conditions that do exist in
many of the finer laboratories - a fact attested to by many of
the people who wrote us in response to appearance of his story,
and by one of our own F.P.E.A. directors, and then Vice President
of the Association, who is himself in a position to know. He

is in charge of the Medical Research Department of the Veterans
Hospital here in Denver.

We do realize, however, that such ideal conditions do not exist
in many, many places, and the need for the proposed legislation
is great. We would like very much to do our part in arousing the
peOple to do their part to ensure its passage. I look forward to
hearing from you further.

ﬂrdially,

NO EXCUSE FOR CHUEBTY Cats Magazine
due 20 Nov.,1962
By George Freedley
We all recOgnjze the importance of experimentation on
animals to determine the effects of medicines and
injectﬁons eventually ﬁntended for the benefft of
mankand and to raﬁse world health standards. However

we do insist on preper care for the health and well

being of the animals used for experiment.

It has been pointed out to me that cats have been kept
for longish periods in chicken wire cages with no
floors and no proper place for an anfmal to lie down
and sleep wathout exacerbating hﬁs flesh. This is
supposed to have happened and still is happenfng in

New York State where T reside. Naturally for offﬁcial

reasons photographers are not allowed in animal

quarters so it is ﬁmpossible to exhibit photographic
evidence Short of smugglﬁng in hidden cameras wh%ch is
not of the polﬁcy of the Society for Animal Protect‘ve
Legislation which has supplied me wsth the documentat«on

for this article.

Great headway was made at the hearﬁngs on September 28,
1962 towards the goal of enact‘ng H.R. 1937 for the
humane treatment of experﬂmental animals. Unfortunately
the adjournment of the Congress was too near to attaen

vote for enactment of this much needed act.

 




It should be of interest to the readers of this
magazﬁne that the so called Animal Care Panel seems
less 5nterested in protecting cats, dogs and other
animals used in medical research than in sell£ng
equipment, food, cages and animals to the various
research centres. Curiously or economically this Panel
is fanatically Opposed to H.H. 1957. Please wrﬁte your

congressman or senator urging him to support actﬁvely

H.HJ l957&t%§ identical Senate bill, S 5088. It 58

extremelyveasy not to wrﬁte these letters but £f you
love your pet, I urge you to do so at once. If you
need furﬂner documentation for your letters, write to
the Socfety for Anﬁmal Protective Legislatfon, 745

Fffth Avenue, New York 22, N.Y.

I was jmmensly impressed as I thﬁnk you will be by the
New York Tames edﬁtorﬁal for October 26, 1962, headed
"Experiments w€th Animals". The text follows:
"Many of the great achievements of modern medfcal
research would not have been possible without
expersmentatﬁon on animals. Researchers must
rema4n free to avaal themselves of this in-
valuable technique; but all freedoms bear in-

herent respons§b31£ties.

Public hearings were held recently by the house
Committee;on Interstate ami Foreﬁgn Commerce on
legislation to ﬁnsure the proper care of

laboratory animals and to prevent unnecessary

- 2 -

 




experements and unnecessary pasn. Respons*ble
researchers know that good care of animals is
essentﬁal to valid experimentation. Nevertheless
the thirst for scﬁentifﬁc knowledge combfned with
human carelessness may sometﬁmes result in
laboratory condﬁtjons and procedures which do not

‘ meet the hﬁghest standards of medﬁcal research

Bills introduced ﬁn the Senate and house during

the past session were patterned on legﬁslation

enacted in England 86 years ago. The British
example, which has not hampered fruﬁtful medﬁcal

research, should be followed here."

You can never tell when your beloved pet may be lost or
stolen and sold for medﬁcal purposes. Worthy as these
causes may be, all animals should be protected and not
abused before facﬁng their ordeal. Protect not only
your own pet but the homeless and unwanted who have no

one to Speak for them.
