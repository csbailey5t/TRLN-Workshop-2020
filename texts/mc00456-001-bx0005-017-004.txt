November, 1944.
Dear Sir,

Once again, owing to the restrictions on paper, we are
only able to send you a small Leaflet, giving a few facts about
the P.D.S.A. instead of our usual pre—war Annual Booklet. But
I am sure you will be highly gratified to see from the Leaflet
how our work continues to increase; for in 1944 we have not only
treated daily vast throngs of patient dumb ones in their hour of
suffering, but during the recent visits of the Flying Bombs, we
have gone and are going, as in previous Raids, where the Bombs
are falling, to rescue the poor, buried, injured animals: many
mutilated beyond recognition.’ .

I wish it were possible for the P.D.S.A. to exist without
the necessity of financial help. But money we must have. And
to whom can I better tell of our urgent need than to our ever
generous supporters?

At this time of the year, perhaps your heart will
especially go out to the Suffering Animals - so pathetic in their
inability to speak about their pain — and you may be able to send
a Xmas contribution to the P.D.S.A.: and so, once more, make it
possible for us to continue our Great Work of Mercy.

In anticipation, please let me thank you on behalf of
the Animals.
I am,
Yours gratefully,

P.S.— 7

Last August I sent a Special Appeal for our Rescue Squads:
and now once again we are hard at work dealing with further
Animal Victims of the enemy’s latest form of horror.

If you were good enough to send a contribution to my August
Appeal or any other recent contribution please again let me +hank
you most sincerely for your help: and perhaps you could further
help us by sending the enclosed Leaflet to some other Animal Lover?
