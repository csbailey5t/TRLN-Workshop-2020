bill, Humane Laboratory Animal Treatment Act.

While neither Congressman Rogers nor Senator Javits has
re-introduced this legislation as yet, you may be sure

that I shall bear in mind what you have advised should

it be introduced and come'before the Senate. As one who
supported Public Law 89-5hh, Laboratory.Animal Welfare

I would be skeptical of legislation to transfer this function
to the Department of Health, Education and'Welfare.

Dear Miss Rugg:

This will acknowledge and thank you for your letter of June
20 relative to the use of animals for laboratory experiments.

While I feel that the use of animals in laboratories is
essential to research, that portion which is particularly
objectionable to society should be kept to a minimum.
Legislation along this line will have my most careful
consideration.

I am sure you know that I supported legislation in the 89th
Congress to establish humane care and treatment standards

for those animals which are destined for use in the develOp-
ment of medical science. Also, you will be interested to
know that I co-sponsored S. 3332 of the 89th Congress to amend
the Public Health Service Act to provide special assistance
for the improvement of laboratory animal facilities.

With kind regards, I remain

Your letter of June 27, 1967, has been received.
YOur interest in the school lunch program, animal welfare
funds, and the cropland adjustment program is noted.

The subcommittee has completed marking up the
.Agricultural.Appropriation Bill for fiscal year 1968, and it
is anticipated that the full Committee will act as soon as
the Congress reconvenes after the recess.

, The actions of the Subcommittee are not available
for release, but I can tell you that the Subcommittee has
given sympathetic consideration to the needs of these pro-
grams in which you have expressed an interest, especially in
the light of the action taken by the other body. On the
whole, I think you will be pleased with the Subcommittee
recommendations if they are approved by the full Committee.

Thank you for contacting me relative to the pending apprOpriation
to the Department of Agriculture for the enforcement of Public

is highly necessary and so did all members of my Appropriation
subcommittee.

The full Committee approved $1.2 Million for this purpose and
the full Senate passed it in that form.

The matter will now go to conference with the House of Rep-
resentatives where any Objection to this humane effort must
undoubtedly exist, as we could find none in the Senate.

I suggest that your efforts should be concentrated there.

Dear Mrs. Burnham:

Thank you for your recent postal card expressing your support
of S. 2322, pertaining to the theft and sale of animals for
use in experimental laboratories.

Over the years I have made it a policy not to comit myself

on measures which have not been reported to the Senate unless

I am a member of the committee handling them. This is because
committee amendments can so completely change a bill that it

is unreasonable. Therefore, I do not feel that I can take a
stand on S. 2322 until it is reported by the comittee consider~

ing it.

Please be assured, however, that I shall give it my closest
attention when it comes to the Senate Floor.

With kind regards, I remain

Dear Friend:

Thank you for your recent communication advising of your interest
in legislation relative to humane treatment to animals. I regret
that it is necessary to use this method of replying to you; however,
due to my limited staff and the number of letters received, it is
not possible to personally respond to each one of them.

No doubt you are aware that various bills pertaining to this sub-
ject have been introduced in this Congress. Such proposals refer
to the regulation of transportation, sale and handling of animals
intended for purposes of experimentation, maltreatment of dogs and
cats used in experimentation, and the theft of animals.

I appreciate having your comments, as well as those of many others
on this important:matter, and you may be sure that I share your con-
cern. Should these proposals reach the Senate Floor for debate and
action they will receive my most careful attention.

With kind regards, I am

Yours faithfully,

WW

Dear Nﬂss Harrison:

I appreciate your advising me of your views in support of legislation
providing for regulations in the transportation, sale and handling of
animals for research purposes. Measures on this subject, H.R. 13881
and S. 2322, have been introduced in the House and Senate, respectively.

You probably know that H.R. 13881 passed the House on April 28 and
passed the Senate, amended, by unanimous vote on June 22. If enacted
into law it will establish humane standards of treatment for animals,
including rabbits, hamsters and guinea pigs, by animal research and
medical facilities; will protect owners of cats and dogs from theft of
their pets; and will prevent the use or sale of stolen dogs or

cats for research purposes.

A House-Senate Conference has been scheduled on this measure to
resolve differences between the Heuse and Senate versions. Hopefully,
we will be able to retain the provisions recommended.by the Senate
Committee on Commerce and approved.by the Senate.

With kind regards, I remain

Yours faithfully,
