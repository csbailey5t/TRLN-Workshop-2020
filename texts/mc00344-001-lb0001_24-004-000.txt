Pet-partial adults have long stressed the joys and learning opportunities
inherent in pet ownership. But living with an animal can also be a nuisance
and, at times, a cause of heartbreak and despair. This special blend of pleas-
‘ure and pain is revealed in excerpts from comments on “My Pet,” freshly

When l first got Timmy I was afraid of him.
I wanted to put him on my finger with gloves

. that is how we became friends. Now he goes
‘ on my head, my shoulder, my finger and on

l have three pigeons. They are in a cage. l
like to go to get more pigeons. The pigeons

Clinger is one. of my little kittens. He always

When he was first born he was in a box up on
the third floor. He was very small. He looked

kittens before they all looked like apple cores.

I forgot the name of the cat
because she died a long time ago. I got a
new one for Christmas. We are not sure if
it‘is'a boy or girl. Its name is Jingles. We
more often ’call it ‘Pussy. And anyhow it

I have a parakeet at home. He does lots of
tricks and talks too. These are the words he
can say: want some scotch, pretty bird, dirty
trick and come on and perk, Peter.

My bird is sloppy. Anytime we eat, he eats.
Anytime he eats, he makes a mess. Almost
everyday we have to clean his cage. I didn't
expect that I would get such a sloppy bird.
There were many other birds but I picked this
one. A hamster would be much more neat
because he would not be on top of anybody.

TURTLES

First I am going to tell you what is important
for anyone who has a turtle to know. The turtle
does not really have places for_its arms to
stick into its body. When he pulls his arms
close to his shell, they are protected. He
has a little ruffle on his neck that allows him
to pull his head near his shell.

l

i like my turtle because he tickles my hand.

I can have turtle. races with him. l can build.

houses for him with my blocks. He some-
times escapes. ! always find him.

My turtle, Harold, is like an amphibious tank,
a wild amphibious tank. A wild amphibious
tank because of his shell and when he gets
in water he swims but he's crazy in the
water. One day he tried to escape from his
fish bowl; he got to the rim, he got to the
rim of his box, and he climbed my shirt.

0 O 0

My turtle knows the feeling of my hand. When
somebody else picks him up he tries to get
out of their hand. My turtle knows how to
jump over a pencil. My turtle I hope will
have a baby turtle for me like my canary did.

(Continued on Page 104)

Frogs are hard to keep, mainly because they
get away. l like them because you sure can
have a lot of fun trying to make them stay put.
Eddie brought a frog to school. When we
opened the box he jumped right out. Eddie
caught him. Then we let him go on the play-
ground because he wanted more dirt and good
things to eat. He wanted to be with his friends.
Salamander-s and newts . . .

During this summer I obtained salamanders
from a nearby swampy stream. Every day i
went to the stream to get more. Sometimes a
lady who lives in the house used to throw
them out. That is why I got more every day.
It looked like it had the
chickenpox. it was my friend. Its name was
Nippy. Its color was like a chimney. He
would go to sleep at 6 o'clock.

l wish l had a hog-nosed snake. I wish I
had any reptiles or an amphibian. But l

FISH

Before I went to camp last summer my fish

could say, “No." They could do this by,

shaking their heads sideways. But when I
came home from camp they could not say
"No."l think the reason why they could not is
because probably they did not remember me.

O O O

I have only one fish, or I should say half a
fish. My sister and I each had a fish but
one died and we do not lmow which one.

My pets are fish. I have about eight of them.
They are guppies. I feed them a special lrind
of cereal, but I do not cool: it.
My fish live in a tanlt that is not too big and
not too small. They have. some artificial flow-

ers in their tanlr. They also have some white ‘

gravel which is getting gray.

l had two goldfish. One died. I didn't feel
well when he died. I did feel well, not sick,
but I was very sorry. The other fish went
round and round looking. He had no one to
play with. He didn't have a friend.

A Play about Saint Francis of Assisi and the Birds

NARRATOR

Good morning, boys and girls. Here in Be~Kind~to~Animals Week, which
we are now observing all over America, it is pleasant to think how many of the
world's greatest men were kind to animals, men who were famous presidents
and statesmen, men who were great writers and poets and artists and actors,
men who founded great religions and men in other fields of work as well, whose
names also live on in history.

They were brave and strong-hearted men; yet they were wise enough to
know that a man could have a stout and fearless heart and still be merciful to
all defenseless creatures. They knew that kindness and compassion were not a
sign of weakness—~but a sign of strength! They knew that the other kind of man,
the kind who likes to think of himself as hard-boiled and a wise guy, was usually
a timid soul, afraid of what somebody might say about him. People might say
he was a softie, for example, if he tried to be gentle and merciful to animals.
Some men are like that~~they just haven't the courage to be kind to the birds
and animals all around them.

But that is the kind of courage the great men of history had. They were
stout—hearted, these men who believed in kindness to animals.

One of these great and noble men was Saint Francis of Assisi, Throughout
the earth there are churches dedicated to his name; the religious order which he
founded encircles the globe.

Today we have a story for you-~a story which will bring you two real
happenings in the life of Saint Francis. 50 let us go back through the years-~seven

hundred years to the thirteenth century, to the time when Saint Francis traveled

afoot up and down the roads of Italy, when people knew him only as Brother Francis.

 




-3..

As our tale begins to unfold, we find a group of boys and girls playing under
some shady trees along a country road on the Italian hills.
(Sound of marching feet, clapping land and laughter to indicate a singing game.)
L.LE.JO-~Tlu‘2re's someone coming!
PICA” what of it?
GIACOMAl-e Who is it?
UGOLINO» - You’d think nobody ever traveled along this road!
PICA-~ Oh, Leo just want to break up our game because he can't be in it.

ILLUMINATQH Why don't you go home, cripple? It's only a step back to the village.
You don't need us. You've got your crutch!

(The game has broken up.)

MARIA-— (In alarm) It isn't robbers, is it? I'm going to look!
(She dashes to the back of the stage to peer down the road.)

LEO-- No, no; it isn't robbers.

ILLUMINATC-- You're always trying to do something to stOp our fun. Somebody's
coming! What of it? They don‘t care if we're just playing here.

LEO—- But what I saw who was coming-~it's those preachers, those brothers who
wear those rough brown. robes.

MARIA" Yes, that's who it is. I can see them.

PACIFICO -— Yes, there they are. That's the way they travel over Italy, peOple
say, begging as they go along.

MARIA-- And preaching, too ~- don't forget. And helping people every way they can.

lLLUMINATO-- That‘s what everybody says. I've heard my father and mother tell
about them often.

(Sound of church-bells in the distance)

GIACOMA—~I've heard my grandfather speak of the Little Poor Man of Assisi. I
wonder if he is with them. How I'd like to see him.

LEC—- That is the one they call Brother Francis, isn't it?

 




-4-

MARIA" I wouldn't know if he was with them. I haven‘t .ever seen him. Look,
there are three of them all wearing those brown robes.

LEO--— I thought maybe they would scold us for playing foolish games and being
idle. The preachers often do.

ILLUMINATO-uBrother Francis won‘t. I’ve award people say he isn't that kind
of preacher. He isn't long-faced at all; he laughs and sings and seems to be
happy all the time.

LEO-- It's queer that he could feel happy.

GIACOMA--What‘s queer about that?

ILLUMINATO-- Because he's so poor and has to beg for a living. His father is
a very rich man, they say, but Brother Francis gave all that up, his fine

home and his magnificent clothes, to go out and do what God told him to do.

(A bird bursts into song in the tree-teps.)
Bird-whistle or recording.

LEO~~ Did you hear that?

PACIFICO - - What?

LEO-- That bird singing like that.

PACIFICO ~- (In Disgust) Oh, that!

UGOLINC—- Nobody‘s interested in birds. What are they good for!
lLLUMINATO—-They're all right to kill.

LEO~~ I don't like to kill them.

ILLUMINATO-u- No, you wouldn't! But everybody else does. W hat else are they
good for? They aren't anything.

LEOuHow do you know? That they aren't anything?
ILLUMINATO-~Baby! Baby! Doesn't want to kill the little birds!

(The boys and girls laugh jeeringly)

PlCA--— (Tauntingly) Nice little baby! Doesn't like to kill birds.

 




-5-
UGOLINC~~ (Mocking) Might hurt his bad leg and then he'd cry.
(The boys and girls surround Leo, jeering at him and tormenting him)

LEO-m (Defiantly) Go on and make fun of me! I still say it! I don't like to kill
birds!

NARRATGR-— (While the distant church bells sound) -- While the boys and girls
were poking fun at poor Leo, Brother Francis and his two companions came

upon the scene. You should see their dusty brown robes.

BROTHER FRANCIS-u (Pleasantly) Did I hear some boy say that he didn‘t like to
to kill birds?

UGOLINO andILLUMINATO-- He did. . . . . He did. . . . . He was the one.

BROTHER FRANCIS” For that, our Heavenly Father sends a special blessing down
upon you, little lad. . . . What is your name?

LEC" "‘ L30.

BROTHER FRANCIS—- Leo! Leo means a lion! I can see that you have the brave
heart of a lion. When these boys and girls mocked you, you were not afraid.

UGOLINO—-(/‘.~stonished) Did you hear that?

LEO~-Are you-~are you Brother Francis?

BROTHER FRANCIS—- Yes, that is What they call me.

MARIA-~ We have heard so much about you.

BROTHER FRANCIS-~ I am only the little poor man of Assisi. (To the Brothers)
Brother Masseo and Brother Angelo, here it is pleasant and shady. Let us
rest our tired feet then, for a little time. Do not be afraid, boys and girls,
talk and be happy.

ILLUMINATO-nOh, here's Pietro already! With his wicker-cage!

GIACOMA-o-Look at the turtle-doves that he's caught! His cage is full.

PIETRO-- Luck was with me today. Every snare that I set had a bird fast in it.

UGOLINO-- Think how rich you’ll be.

PIETRO--(Laughing) Rich! At least, I'll get a few coppers for them when I take
them to the market. I'd better be going there, too, before it closes.

 




ILLUMINATO -- No, it doesn't stay Open long at this season when the sun rises
so early.

BROTHER FRANCIS-u» Good youth, I pray you give me these gentle birds. Surely
you must know that in the Holy Scriptures chaste and humble and faithful souls
are compared to these doves which you have captured.

PIETRO—~(Puzzled) Why. . . . why. . . . . erw-

ILLUMINATO-u- Don‘t be foolish, Pietro, why should you give your doves away?

PACIFICO~~ It isn't always as easy for you to get them as it was this morning.

MARIA-w Give him, perhaps, one dove, Pietro. That is all that you need to do.
Other peOple, too, will help him if he is hingry.

BROTHER FRANCIS-- I am not hungry my child.
ILLUMINATO-~Then why do you ask Pietro for his doves?

BROTHER FRANCIS --(With simple dignity) Because I look upon them with eyes of
pity.

UGOLINO—-(Puzzled) Pity! I don't understand.
BROTHER FRANCIS-o- Because I feel compassion for them.

UGOLINO-«nJust for those birds?

BROTHER FRANCIS-~Yes, just for those birds.

ILLUMINATO --Don’t give your birds away, Pietro, if that is all he want them for.
Don't be a fool.

BROTHER FRANCIS-n- I ask you again to give me those gentle birds, Pietro. Do
not let them fall into the hands of cruel men who would kill them.

NARRATOR-~ But look what is happening! Pietro has fallen to his knees; he is
holding out the wicker basket to Brother Francis.

PIETRO~- Take them, take them, Brother Francis. I don't know what has
happened, but it suddenly seemed to me that God has passed by~~very near
to us.

BROTHER FRANCIS-u- That is good. And now -- O my little sister, simple,
innocent and chaste doves, why have you let yourselves be snared? See, I
will snatch you from death and make nests for you, wherein you may increase
and multiply according to the commandment of our Creator.

 




-7-

GIACOMA~~ (Tirnidly) Brother Francis, did-~did you call them your little
sisters?

BROTHER FRANCIS-- Yes, they are my little sisters -- and they are yours.
All of the creatures that fly through the air and creep over the earth are my
sisters and brothers. They are my brothers and sisters because God is the
Father of us all. The Creator who created you and me also created them.
We are all His children, all of us together.

PIETRO--(Still kneeling) Brother Francis, will you let me go with you? Will you
let me follow you? I will help you make the nests for the doves; I will help you
in all ways that I can.

BROTHER FRANCIS-u Come with me, little son. Thou wilt yet be a Brother in
this Order.

PICA-- O Pietro, it's through those birds that we have lost you!

BROTHER FRANCIS--— And it is through those birds that Pietro has discovered
the nearness of God.
(Sound of church-bells)

UGOLINO—- But you talked to those doves as though they understood you! How
could that be?

BROTHER FRANCIS-~I can not say that they understand all my words but I know
well that they understand me; because they are like me and I am like them.
We are all of one kindred. We are the children of Him who gave to us every
one the great gift of life. Because of that beautiful gift they too are here, all
the birds and the beasts who live with us upon the earth.

UGOLINO—~ But the birds and the beasts of which you speak don't understand me.
Why is that?

BROTHER FRANCIS-~ Because you have never passed through the door. You have
never ever tried to Open that door.

LEO AND UGOLINO-~ Door? . . . . . What door is that?

BROTHER FRANCIS-- The door into the hidden world of nature-- where you
understand the birds and the beasts and they, in turn, understand you.

UGOLINO-- But where is there such a door? How could we find it?

BROTHER FRANCIS -- It is here. It is everywhere -- the door to a new world!
But you can not see it unless your eyes are filled with the light of mercy.
You can not open it except with the hands of kindness.

(The trees are suddenly filled with the singing of birds.)
Bird whistles, or recordings.

 




LEC--— Listen!
BROTHER FRANCIS-- Yes, it is the song of their happiness.

LEO-- Look! Look up into the tree-teps! A great multitude of birds has
gathered here.

PIETRO--W hat has happened? It's very strange.

BROTHER FRANCIS-v No, it is not strange. , Only now your eyes are opened and
you can see. Sit down my children, in the cool shade there --~ and there. Be
still as the listening grass, so that those who sit in the tree—tOps shall not be
afraid. Wait a little for me in the road, Brother Masseo, Brother Angelo,
and I will preach to my sisters, the birds.

(Bird voices are heard in the background)
MARIA-«C Pica, what does he mean?
PICA~~ I never heard of such a thing. Who ever did!

LEO-- S-s-s-sh! Be still.
(The bird voices fall silent as Brother Francis begins preaching)

BROTHER FRANCIS-- (With heart-felt reverence) My little sisters, the birds
much beholden are you to God your Creator, and in all places you ought to
praise Him, because he has given you liberty to fly about everywhere, and
has given you double and triple raiment. And again ye are beholden to Him
for the element of the air, which He has appointed. for you, and for that he
feeds you, and gives you the brooks for your drink, the mountair s and valleys
for your refuge, and the tall trees wherein to make your nests. Wherefore,
your Creator loveth you much, since He has bestowed on you so many benefits.
And so beware, my little sisters, of the sin of ingratitude, and study always
to please God.

(Bird voices burst out again joyously. The church-bells ring)

Come with me, Pietro, our brother are awaiting us down the long road.
Farewell, boys and girls, God's blessing be with you-~-ever.

BOYS AND GIRLS--— Farewell. . . . . Farewell.

ANNOUNCER-- And so our story ‘endsvu- the story of One Morning Long Ago--—
a proper story to tell again on a day like this in Kindness Week.

NATUREIN

By Ellison Smith

A Staﬂ‘ Correspondent

WESTPORT, Conn.

A large group of children who
live in the country are now get-
ting the kind of. education
about nature and animals that
many city children have long
enjoyed.

About 1,000 children and
parents from exurban com-
munities that have preseived

their sylvan glades and grassy
~ ., ‘Ws——Westport, Fairfield,

3—showed up for a tour

. .c Mid- Fai1ﬁe1d County

Youth Museum, which ofﬁcially
opened yesteiday.

They were led by the mu-
seum’s ' junior staff—children
who have worked there since
it was only a shell—through
a one-story, midern-looking
building, the ﬁrst unit in a
proposed complex that will

 

THE RAW F OR COUNTRY CHILDREN

embrase the range of the natu-
ral sciences.

The new museum is located,
appropriately, enough, at the
end of a woodsy dirt road
reached, after one leaves the
Merritt Parkway at Exit 41, by
driving along winding, country
roads.

Even New York’s nature-wise
children, those who over the
years have taken advantage of
the range of nature study of-
fered at the American Museum
of ‘Natural History or who have
learned about animals through
the Bronx Zoo’s school prog-
ram, will feel a twinge of envy
at the new museum.

It is surrounded by a ﬁfty-
acre sanctuary Where one can
study wild ﬂowers, animals,
trees and birds to heart’s con-
tent.

Yesterday, the main exhibit

 

was a series of wall-set display
cases that tell the story of
Connecticut’s evolution and its
natural history. Also featured
were a tame screech owl named
Archie, two unnamed raccoons
and an eel, also unnamed,

which slithered vigorously for
the beneﬁt of watchers.

The museum’s animal wealth,
however, was not on view be-
cause a large display room
where animals may be studied
-—-and petted—is not yet
complete. The animals are al-
ready there, however, and on
a ,day-to—day basis they are
being visited by children of the
area.

They also are being lent to
schools and some of them are
being taken on regular visits to
hospitalized children. Available

 

are rabbits, guinea pigs, white

a. V 131...;

rats and a de-odorized skunk
named Fiorello, Which is so
well-cared for that at nine it
has outlived skunk life expect-
ancy by ﬁve years.

Another particular pet of the
museum is a muskrat named
Homer. “Pick him up gingerly,
though, With his tail end point-
ing toward you. He’s called a
muskrat for a reason. Quite a
strong odor,” explained Mrs.
Patricia A. Walker,
seum’s administrative assistant.

Alan R. Mahl, director of the
museum, said that starting next

spring the museum will initiate .

a program whereby “respon-
sible” children can check an
animal out on loan for a week.
Mr. Mahl is so eager to make
children appreciative of nature
that ,he plans to have classes
for three—year-olds next year.

A YOUTH-SERVICE PROGRAM OF THE DOG CARE DIVISION OF THE RALSTON PURINA COMPANY

 

 

December 4, 1961

Dear Education Director:

We believe you will be interested in the new
materials on pets and pet care which are available to
you without charge from the Ralston Purina Company.

 

Over the past two years, Ralston has distributed
150, 000 sets of teaching materials on pets to elemen—
tary schools throughout the United States. Now in
response to numerous requests from Humane Societies
and youth and recreation leaders, Ralston is offering
comparable materials, called the Pets and PeOple
Packet.

 

These materials are fully described in the en-
closed brochure.

Distribution is limited to one Packet per youth
leader. If you wish, you may order one Packet for
each of the youth leaders in your organization. Insofar
as possible, we will attempt to send you the number
of Packets you request.

To obtain your Packet(s), simply fill out the
request card included in the enclosed brochure and
drop it in the mail. We'll pay the postage.

Sincerely,

I
Diana Henley,

Education Director, ASPCA

PETS HELP TRAIN CITIZENS

Many youth and recreation programs
have good citizenship as one of their
primary aims. But nothing is harder to
teach than responsible citizenship.

The Pets and People Packet will help
you do this.

Through pet ownership, even very
young children can learn what it means
to be responsible. Depending on the age
of the child, he can learn about his
responsibilities for feeding, caring for,
and training his pet.

Older children can work on projects

that will give them a ,sense of community
responsibility. For example, they can be
encouraged to ﬁnd out what the city laws
are concerning pets and why the laws
are necessary.

Uncontrolled pets can cause problems
in many communities. Youth groups can
help in community campaigns to control
roving or barking dogs. Teenagers, in
cooperation with civic authorities, can
help conduct information campaigns on
community laws concerning animals.

Many municipal and county govern-

ments throughout the country are now
engaged in a “Good Dog Neighbor” pro-
gram, using materials provided by the
Dog Care Division of the Ralston Purina
Company. If your community is one of
these, your own program may be of
direct help in this effort, and be even
more exciting to your group.

The Pets and People Packet contains
many other suggestions on how pets can
help lead to a keener sense of responsi-
bility and social consciousness on the
part of youth.

. . . NEW PROGRAM MATERIALS
AVAILABLE WITHOUT CHARGE TO
YOUTH AND RECREATION LEADERS! '

 

A YOUTH-SERVICE PROGRAM OF THE

DOG CARE DIVISION OF THE RALSTON PURINA COMPANY

Pets are a natural for youth group activities. Young people are already deeply interested in

pets and most of them are pet owners. This interest provides a natural vehicle for youth

workers looking for new program ideas.

With properly prepared materials, your program can capitalize on interest in pets to provide

fun for your group and help for you in presenting worthwhile activities.

Knowing, doing and growing are three things that can be done well with pets.

The boy or girl with a dog, cat, hamster,
bird or any other animal wants to know
more about that animal. He wants to know
how to take care of it. He wants to know
what to do for it when it’s sick and how to
keep it well.

He wants to know safety rules for the ani-
mal and for himself as a pet owner. He
wants to know how to handle his pet, and
how to train it to be obedient and well-

behaved.

Young people like to form clubs, so a pet
club is a natural. They like to go on ﬁeld
trips to see other animals in the woods or
in museums. They enjoy trips to humane
societies, to aquariums, to pet stores and
kennels.

They like to hold a pet fair. They like arts
and crafts projects with animals as the
theme. They like games involving animals
and their knowledge of animals. They like
to make posters about pets.

Using his pet as a springboard of interest,
a young person likes to grow by learning
more about the world around him. A dog
owner likes to look up facts about dogs
around the world and discuss those facts
with his club members. These youthful
citizens like to learn about their responsi-
bilities for pets in their own community.
They want to learn about careers in the
pet ﬁeld, and what various professions
and agencies concerned with pets do.

Hissing air brakes, rumbling

children’s pleasant noise. If

Dear Miss Stevens,

Please accept my apology for the excessive delay in repIying
to your letter of November 30. Actually it arrived in the same mail
'with one from Miss Carson-~both became tangled with another project
and were mislaid!

   
    
   
  
    
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
    

 
 

I am entirely sympathetic with your objective and wish you
success with it. At the same time I am.sure you realize that in order
to be of effective help to you would require a major expenditure of
time and effort which neither I nor our staff are able to provide.

I am forwarding to you herewith three pieces of material
which we refer to as "Student Guides" which our staff has created to
complement our Natural Science and Conservation Television course for
public schools in Massachusetts. A fourth such Student Guide is
contemplated but has not been created as yet. I hope these are of some
value to your-from your letter I gather that this is somewhat of what
you have in mind.

'We would certainly be interested in hearing the details of
your booklet and receiving a copy when it is eventually produced because
it doubtless will have much information and many ideas that can be
integrated with our rather extensive teaching program.

Stamford's museum and science center makes it easy

NOVEL and surprisingly successful adventure in

public education, the Stamford (Connecticut)
Museum and Nature Center this year will play host
to perhaps a quarter of a million visitors —-—. cer-
tainly more than 4,000, mostly children, on almost
any pleasant Sunday afternoon.

Less than a mile north of Merritt Parkway at the
corner of High Ridge and Scoﬁeldtown Roads, the
museum owns'80 acres of woodland, meadows, trees,
_ . f g _ plants, ﬂowers, a three-acre lake, wildlife, and some

the past year, the museum also now offers:

Hayden Planetarium in New York —-— which is the
special joy of [the Junior Astronomy Club, ages

l A natural science center, the ﬁrst of its kind in
the metropolitan area, which actually is a working
nature laboratory for children of eight and up.
Built in the woods at the hub of some 10 miles of
labeled nature trails, the center is the key to all the
natural exhibits outside.

The museum is properly dedicated to conserva-
tion, but gives that sometimes dull word a provoca-
tive deﬁnition as “the wisest possible use of our
resources both natural and human.”

Thus, besides nature programs, there are regular
art exhibits and classes, music courses, and even
surprises like a doll-house display. Included in this
were a brownstone owned by Mrs. John Tee-Van,
niece of Walter Damrosch; an 8’x5’ house made by

time and money, that it receives from thousands of
Stamfordites.

The museum began modestly some 20 years ago
in a downtown ofﬁce room equipped with a few
small natural history collections “and some large
ideas,” says director Ernest T. Luhde. Later,
exhibits Were housed in a city-owned building in
Courtland Park, and the present layout is a sort of
by-product of the Connecticut Thruway, which cut
through the grounds and forced the museum to

‘move.

2 Through public contributions and help from
wealthy donors and foundations, the $140,000
Henri Bendel estate was bought, and the museum
has been ﬂourishing ever since.

By taking over part of the gatekeepers’ two-story
stucco cottage as its headquarters, the Stamford
Junior League makes “a very substantial contribu—
tion” to the museum’s maintenance. The new plan—
etarium is the gift of friends of the late Mr. and
Mrs. Malcolm Edgerton, enthusiastic museum sup-

porters, who were killed in a plane crash. The Over—

brook Natural Science Center was donated by Mr.

and Mrs. Frank Altschul through their Overbrook.

a special dance to tell one another the exact spot
where a rich supply may be found”. '

Last year about 42, 000 children participated in
various organized activities at the museum. Thanks
to an anonymous donor, bus transportation was
arranged for almost 1,000 children from various
welfare agencies and housing projects. Hundreds
were enrolled in 31 Classes ranging from astronomy
to plant science, working earnestly toward the 10
points that will give them a “degree” in the natural
sciences.

- ' Popularity has spread

Indeed, response has been so enthusiastic through
the area all around Stamford that the museum has
found it necessary to charge fees when out-of—town
classes descend upon it. (Most of its current ex~

penses are borne by membership fees, charges for _

the special classes, and gifts." There’s no charge for
"casual visitors, and the museum is open daily,
except Mondavs. )

Although intended mainly for children, the mu-
seum doesn’t overlook adults, and Fairﬁeld County
astronomers, archaeologists, artists, and musicians
participate in various programs. And because the
museum is located on one of the main ﬂyways for
migratorv birds, its trails are haunted by bird
watchers

Ev en police chief Joseph W. Kinsella makes use
of its facilities in an emergency. Recently he had a
lost cow on his hands for more than a day, and the

, second morning she loudly announced her distress .

farmer to practice the art, almost forgotten in
Fairﬁeld County.

began collecting animals when
he was a Boy Scout in Stam—

“With live animals you can

.reach all kinds of kids that are

unreachable in other ways,” he
said. “I remember going into
the Stamford Boys Club one
day with some live animals.
They had a lot of tough kids
and some of them put a couple
of stink: bombs in my car. I
shoWed the boys the live an-

Science for
Every Child! We take it for granted, in

this scientiﬁc age, that the study of science is a good
thing. And it is a good thing—but for more than the
obvious reasons that come to mind. Science has
Something to offer to every child, not just to the
embryo space pilot and the infant Einstein.

Science helps children to feel related to their world.
This was no problem to our grandparents. Their
world was a fairly simple place. Their food, their
clothing, their housing and amusements were all
homegrown products, visible and comprehensible.
But our youngsters wake up to the buzz of an
electric alarm (how does electricity keep timeP),
listen to the weather report (how does a radio
work?), put on nylon underwear (is it really made
out of coal and air?) and head into a day loaded
with the products of science.

What a vast and complicated world our children
face! We can let them go through it with blinders,
as some of us had to do—or we can help them to
see the world all around, above and below, to dis-

cover that its laws are reasonable and comprehensi-
ble.

Science helps children to achieve a sense of secur-
ity. A sense of security comes from knowing what to
expect, from a belief in cause and effect, from a sense
of pattern and predictability. Through the study of
science, children ﬁnd an organized way of making
sense out of their physical world. They ﬁnd out that
things happen for a reason, not wilfully and hap-
hazardly.

To feel related to their world, to feel a sense of
security in it—these are the important and enduring
values of science for every child. And here, in this
list, are some books that will help your child to
achieve these values.

Is THIS age roup interested in science? Deﬁnitely
so! It isn’t t e science of space travel and atomic
energy, but something more personal and impor-
tant: the discovery of the “here and now,” the real
world around us. Youn children want to know
about bugs and beasts, a out sounds and sights and
smells, and especially about themselves. Here are
some books that capture the sense of newness and
wonder that children feel about their world.

Tn the Delegates Attending the Second Canadian Conference on.Education

Brief dealing with the Philosophy of Humane Education and Some Suggested
Techniques for its Inclusion in Schonl Curricula ‘,

Ladies and Gentlemen:

On every hand we see evidences of man’s growing capacity for
cruelty, and it is our considered belief that this dangerous tendency can
be first mitigated, and finally controlled, if sufficient emphasis is placed
on humane education in our society and in our schools.

What is humane education? Its function is to arouse man's noblest
impulses. It is a way of life - one advocated by all the great religions of
the world. It is associated with goodness and mercy, justice and compassion,
with moral standards and character building, and with a keen appreciation of
the enduring truth that cruel means are never justified regardless of the
end in view. * ‘-

' Humane education is Reverence for Life. To qucte from.the accomp
panying article by Drc Albert Schweitzer, greatest living exponent of this
ennnbling philisophy,‘"Whenever I injure life of any sort, I must be quite
clear whether it is necessarv ... Beyond the unavoidable I must never go a,:
Those who experiment with operations or the use of drugs upon animals, or
inoculate them with diseases, so as to be able to bring help to mankind
with the results gained, must never quiet any misgivings they feel, with
the general reflexion that their gruesome proceedings aim at a valuable
result .... Let no one regard as light the burden of his responsibility ..,u
While animals have to endure intolerable treatment from.heartless men, or
are left to the cruel play of children, we all share the guilt."

 

Juvenile delinquency is on the increase. RecOrds of the R.C.M.P.
show that the number of juveniles involved in Criminal Code offences rose
more than 17% in 1957-58. Last year, 1961, more than 15,000 Canadian
children passed through Juvenile Courts. We believe that there is a clOse
connection between inhumane education and juvenile cruelty. The boy of five
who gets a toy gun, and then at l2 gets a BB gun to sharpen his marksmanship
on birds and small animals, is being educated to become callous to suffering.
So is thesstudent who is called upon to witness or perform cruel experiments
on living animals in primary or secondary schools. He is being conditioned
to inflict suffering without sympathyc Supplement this with crime comics,
violence in all its hideous forms on television, plus his own aggressive
drive, and you have all the makings of the juvenile delinquent.

We believe also that there is a very close connection between
humane education and the good lifea Humane education in the hands of a
sympathetic, understanding and informed teacher hr leader takes a firm.stand
for what is right in the treatment of “God‘s animals and birds”, cultivates
habits of kindness, by precept, and by giving pupils opportunities to do
kind things, and so form.habits of kindnesso

There is urgent need for such education. 'We ask the help of every
delegate to this Conference in.forwarding it, Some suggested techniques for
the inclusion of humane education in school curricula follow:

Suggested Technique Number One:

Since a recent survey made at the University of Illinois shows
that, contrary to the opinion held by most parents, teachers and librarians,
the average child‘s basic interest is not in competitive sports, but in

ANIMALS, we suggest this deep interest of the child be taken full advantage
of in the primary grades.

 




- 2 -

‘We suggest that Elementary Science take back its name Nature Study,
and that it be presented mainly in an observational way through frequent
outdoor trips to observe carefully as many forms of life as possible in
their natural environment. In the classroom, too, the same observational
method may be used in as happy and natural a way as possible. In this way
love of nature, wonder at its infinite variety, and respect for its ways
are engendered in the child. At the same time individual training may be
given in patient observation, reasoning and deduction - all a sound
preparation for later scientific study.

 

In the primary grades almost every subject can be readily related
to the arousing of the child's interest in living creatures and to giving
him.respect for even the smallest plant and lowliest animal. In addition
to Nature Study, Reading, English, and special projects all provide ample
opportunity for corelation with humane educatibn.

One technique that has proven its value for the preteens is the Kindness
Club, a humane education activity that lends itself well to inclusion in
special classroom.activities on Friday afternoons. Begun in New Brunswick
in December, 1959, the Kindness Club has already spread far and wide.
Children like the way it is organized, and already it has done great good,
'with quite a number of juvenile delinquents, some with police records,
changed for the better through membership.

The memorizing of poetry stressing kindness and consideration for
animals is another activity that bears lasting good fruit at this time in
a child's life. Beautiful lines learned then are apt to stay with children
through life to influence their happiness, their health and their hobbies
in a surprising way.

Suggested Technique Number Two.

 

In the secondary schools we suggest that scientific studies could
properly deal with the following very important topics:

(a) Conservation of the soil. (Scientists tell us that today onLy
a few inches of top soil stand between all living creatures and
oblivion).

How to stop further pollution and waste of water. (Pure water
supplies are dwindling dangerously),

Preservation of our forests and vegetation. (Only the green
plant has power to turn inorganic chemicaIS'into living tissue).

Conservation of wild life. (Study of the Balance of Nature,

and of human meddling which has frequently proved disastrous.
Study also of the many species of animal life now extinct because
if man's greed and ignorance. whales and seals now threatened).

Study of livestock in Canada‘s economy — stock raising, transport,
slaughter, government regulations and inspection.

Dairying and poultry.

Trapping, humane methods of trapping, fur farms, artificial furs.
Birds and bird migration. Bird protection and the great need for it.
Animals and the law. The place of Humane Societies. How to care

for various kinds of animals according to their natures and their
needs. (It is important to know How TO BE KIND).

 




_ 5 -

Each such study referred to above have overtones that can be used
to arouse man‘s noblest impulses of wisdom.and compassion.

The above studies are all suggested as alternatives to the crude,
callous and educationally pointless experiments on animals now being performed
in some schools and considered in others.

we ask every delegate here to make sure that his Provincial
Department of Education is familiar with the recent Curriculum, Intermediate
Division Science, issued by the Ontario Department of Education, and with
the footnote on page 60:

 

"NOTE: Teachers should note that much of the work of zoology
requires the use of preserved specimens. If animals are used

as teaching aids in the classroom, they must not be put to death
in the presence of the students. Living animals must not be used
in any experiment or demonstration involving pain, distress, or
suffering”,

In the brief presented by the Humane Societies of British Columbia
to the members of the Royal Commission on Education in that Province, we
find these objections raised in regard to noneoperative experiments
involving animals, nutritional experiments, for example: ”This practice
presents to children at the most impressionable age the thought that
animals‘ health and feelings are unimportant; that we have the right to
misuse them.if it is to our advantage, It also causes actual and preventable
discomfort or suffering to the animals (a legal offence); and it predisposes
the child-mind to the idea of animal experiment”,

In the same brief, in regard to operative experiments in schools
which involve animals, the Humane Societies had this to say: "we submit
that the humane approach to the study of zoology is best served by field
work and actual observations and records kept by each pupil of animals
in their natural habitat, such as wild birds, SQuirrels, chipmunks,
insects, spiders, etc.; and the keeping of aquaria, raising of tadpoles,
silk worms, cocoon and chrysalid collections, etc. This has greater
educational va ue in the widest sense than when animals are killed and
structurally analyzed. In no case should living creatures be destroyed
in the classroom for study.”

we submit that experiments on living animals in schools is
education for delinquency, and that no taxpayer with common sense can
subscribe to it, To quote from.the attached article by Dorothy Thompson:

"Anything which encourages cruelty and indifference in the young
is evil and profoundly anti~educational. It is bringing up the
child in the way he should not go, It is demonstrating to him
that it is all right to mistreat nonohuman living creatures,
if the mistreatment contributes to his own well being. The
logical deduction is that it‘s all right to mistreat humans too,
if it furthers one‘s own interest. The consciousness it awakens
has no conscience, It should be stopped.”

Technique Number Three;

 

'We suggest that a program of humane education with emphasis on the
philosophy of Reverence for Life, be incorporated in the course of studies
of teachers-in~training at all of our Provincial Teachers‘ Colleges, and
that this program be supplemented with such studies as wild life conservation
of resources, fishing trapping, livestock, forest protection, etc., as
referred to in scientific studies suggested for secondary schools.

 




Technigue Number Four:

We suggest co~operation with humane societies in projects such as
essay and poster contests, debates, discussions, showing of films, and talks
in schools having to do with interesting the young people in kindness to
animals and birds, and teaching them incidentally HOW TO BE KIND.

-A notable example of this type of co~operation is that of the Ottawa
Humane Society where about 15,000 essays on a humane topic are written
each year by Ottawa school children.

Technique Number Five:

we feel that the present preoccupation with science tends to its
being taught as if it were a soulless, conscienceless, materialistic,
mechanistic subject whose devotees are quite right in adopting the
philosophy of Devil take the hindmost and the helpless. ‘We feel that
this may be the accepted way of thought in some Communist countries.
’We don't feel that we can conquer Communists by adopting their methods -
but rather that we can win only by going back to the good old moral values
that most of us Canadians were taught when we were young. We must
determine our behavior and form.our school curricula on the basis of
what is right and wrong, not on the basis of what other countries or
other individuals are doing. We.must reinstate humane education in our
way of life.

To quote Toynbee,”Ne have to do our part to help mankind to
educate itself against the danger of its destroying itself; and this

is a duty that we dare not repudiate.”

Respectfully submitted,

Senator F. A. McGrand.

(Mrs.) Aida RCA. Flemming.

UNIT XVI
HUMANE EDUCATION

 

OVERVIEW BY TEACHER AND PLANNING WITH PUPILS

A major study of conservation with an outlook to the future of
man's well~being as well as that of the creature world should

become a motivating influence in cultivating the democratic way
of life.

LEARNING ACTIVITIES

a. Extinction

A study of the disappearance of species or forms of life from
the face of the earth is both enlightening and inspiring.
Humane consideration will take on a new lease of interest.
The high school student will profit by special assignment
for available information through geological studies. Nature
has written these records with imprints of permanence and
accuracy more reliable than the more modern recording in
books and libraries. Such a study can be followed advanta—
geously by more modern analysis of trends of life showing
gradual elimination of species. The humane vieWpoint is much
enhanced when the depletion of creature life motivates
resentment. Such is the virtue of visualizing the destructive
aftermath of selfish killing or reckless sportsmanship. We
note with serious concern the creatures in modern times that
have completely disappeared, and others whose disappearance
is threatened. A student can make an interesting report
to the class on such assignments as

The disappearance of the heath hen

The passenger pigeon '

The threat of extinction of the bison, beaver, egret,
bald eagle and wild turkey (others may be added)

Hunting (urban and rural)

(l) Regulating laws and license requirements

6) Large or heavy traps for bear-like creatures and legal
limitation of the same; their danger for humans
7) Live traps, mostly box trap varieties
Freezing and other distress in box traps
8) Waste, ofttimes involving faulty catch in greater numbers

Note: Trapping is rarely kind or humane, but sometimes it is
necessary. It is recognized as the outstanding cruelty in the
economic relationship between animal and man.

Predatory animals

Some of the predatory creatures have value as fur bearers,

for food or for other possible assets, but are known as
predatory because they are destructive of other life of
possible value. Economically a predatory animal is a creature
which destroys more than it saves in human economy. These
creatures give us another slant on a higher level of
appreciation. Although they are destructive, they often
function very effectively in that intricate law known as

THE BALANCE OF NATURE. They may not threaten extinction,

but instead may destroy the weakling of the species, thus
strengthening the race. Some predatory animals, such as
species of owls and hawks, are considered today of economic
value.

The teacher and the class may select for unit activity certain
creatures with habitat in the community, or some assets or
problems related to local animal life. -

Somewhere in the layout of the humanitarian guidance, there
should be included a definite statement to the effect that --
NO LIVING ANIMAL SHALL BE USED IN ANY EXPERIMENT OR

law prohibits such practice in the public schools of
Pennsylvania. (Section 1514, Pennsylvania School Laws, l9h9)

Dear Miss Draper:

The pupils, teacher and I would be most happy to have Mrs. Stevens
use the story of Hunter in any way'she feels will help promote your
fine work. we find the presence of a small animal in a classroom an
invaluable teaching aid.

The immediate response by children to observe and respond through
both oral and visual means - as witnessed in the story of Hunter ~ makes
teaching more sf a pleasure. Many sf our children would never have an
opportunity to experience the trill of caring for and loving an animal
except in these classroom situations.

Each year, I find more teachers expressing the desire to have
animals in their classroom. 'With this type of response, our program
shows healthy growth by both our teachers and children.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Iiiss Draper:

Please excuse the delay in answering, however, I am most happy
te send yen our full curriculum. This is experimental and is still
in the process of being revised and ccrrected.

Last week, I was happy to receive the delightfﬁl stery about
Hunter which I am sending to yen. We feel that a great deal sf
care is taken to pretest the animals in cur classreoms. The sup~
plement that I am also sending tries to cever as much additional
infsrmation that is net covered in the many backs, bulletins and
pamphlets sent out te cur scheols.

sttention: Miss Chrisoine Stevens

Deer Wriend,

I believe we have some UN?TNIQPED RUQINESSc

Your most resent letter of October 39 1958, intimated that you were
still interested in an artiole and pictures of my experiences with

pet visiting days at sonoolg refleoting my experiences as first grade

J , ‘3. v
tesones.

You wtll remember tnet I begged for time after your first kind invitation
of February‘eg 195% to units such an article. I believe I could find
time to work on.it during the next few seeks in case you are still
interested, X em usually the type of person who has to delay suoh

things that the boat ususily lessee me stranded. However, if you have

no other orospeot for snob en artiole I shall be glad to try my hand

8v ‘tr fit. if! .

E still neve a busy sonedule, as I hope to do until I am ready to pass
from this earth. I had s outs card from a teacher friend recently
which ststed ”Blessed are they who run around in Circles for they
shall be known as wheels.” That seemed to fit me to a T.

3 secured my ﬁ.B. Degree in Elementary Eduoation from the University
of Kentuoky this past summer. That may help to give the srtiole
s one ”bite ” to it ., ‘

1 am still teno ing the first grade at Deming School and have twenty—
four pupils this yeero we got off to a good start for the first few
weeks of school and then misfortune broke loose for me. On the 21st
of Sebtember I stepped on a nail at my home, had to have s tetanus
sntitoxin end then five shots of penicillin because of threatened
bloodmpotsoning in the foot. I taught school for two days wdth my
foot in a bucket of not water, Have you ever heard of teaoters being
in not water? I mes, literally, Then on the evening of the 29th I
hoses to break out with the penicillin hives as the result of an
unsuspeoted sllerﬁg, On the 30th of Sept. I was compelled to oo_to
the hospital for treatment. There the doctor pronounced it double rem
aotion, both to the tetsnus and penicillin, either of which could have
been fatal without quick treatment. I had to stay out of school for
two and a half weeks, and only returned last Monday. Tn the meantime,
my‘motherminmlsw, aged 73, with whom we have made our home foo the
pest twentymfive years, passed away on the early morning of the Both.
of 9eot., as the result of a fall and its effect on her bad hesrtt I
was released from the hospital only in time to attend her funeral. In

addition to my sonool work, I now have the entire resnonsibilitv of our
1: .V,

home and three men to care for. However, since I have finished my college
work and have my plans for teaching fairly well in line, I will have

some time to devote to extra things. If you are still interested in the
article, please let me know, and I shall begin work on it immediately.

I should like to know a little more about your ideas for its publication.
Do you want any limit on the length of the article or the numher of
pictures? I am not the kind to write short articles. 0? course, it
should be long enough to be interesting and of help to those teachers
for whom it is intended., The type of publication, either pamphlet or
booklet, might also make a difference in the type of material I could
use, Don‘t you think the use of the first person would he better in
such an experience type of article?

I have some black and.uhite pictures, as well as a few colored slides.
heuld it be possible for you to use any colored reproductions? If not,
I have enough black and white photographs for the article. if I knew

these things in advance, perhaps it would save some extra work on the
manuscript.

Our pet visiting day last year was most successful. I used the visits
in connection with science, nutrition, reading and language. The way
in which this was done would be included in the material I write.

You might be interested to know that l have recently had an article
accepted for publication by our Kentucky School Journal, which is the
official organ for the Kentucky Education Association. It is about
the use of the'Wetael Grids-«growth anc development chartS7-which we
started using in Robertson County Schools. it is to come out in the
Journal either in the January or February edition. I have an appoint-
ment with the editor on Nov. 12 to work out some minor details, hut
have the article and illustrations completed and approved. I did this
in connection with some work at the University of Kentucky on ”Special
Problems in Nutrition" last winter, and wrote the article simply as a
report for my instructor, Who insisted that it must be pnhlished somewhere.
I was flattered by her compliments and even more so when the Journal
accepted it for publication. I‘m not bragging to you, but I am so
excited about it, that I can‘t hold still.

Now, if you decide you still want the article you requested, 1 shall
begin to think I must have some “spark“ for writing about my‘experiences.
After all, with twenty~nine years of teaching under my'helt, I have
learned a few things which might be helpful to other teachers. I
remember my first experiences as a teacher, with only one year of
college, and not a one of those first thirtymthree hours of college

work gave me anything I could use in my classroom. I had to learn

the hard way. I hope to point this material at those young teachers

who are always open and eager for suggestions which will help make

their teaching more profitable and interesting to the children.

I shall look forward to hearing from you soon.

Most sincerely yours,

Attention: Christine Stevens
Dear Friend,

You are so kind and so flattering in offering me the opportunity ofuriting
about classroom visits hy animals and pets which could he circulated to
other teachers. I have teen longing to do just that since I received
your First letter.

You are also right in assuming that I have a very full schedule, but since
there are only 24 hours in the day, and I usually use only six hours of
that for sleep, you may he ahle to understand why I've had to let some

of the things be ostponed that I would like to do. I have my home,

a husband (farmer? a twelve year old son, and my husband's parents (both
in their seventiess, this in addition to my teaching my first graders
which I attempt wholeheartedly. Both last summer, this summer and the
next, I am doing some long-delayed college work in order to get my A.E.
and taking correspondence courses and extension in the winter. Does this
make you hold your breath? ‘Well, it is a very busy life I lead! I keep
hoping that sometime I'll h able to relax, slow-down, and devote some
time to other things, but I m already 48 years old, have taught 27 of
them, and haven‘t found that time yet!

I‘ve had your first request in the back of my mind and know how I shall

go stout it. But I do want some pictures-~had no Flash camera this past
year-«and would like to have a wider variety'o? pets. This past year

we had a duck (which I took), a puppy, a kitten, two baby chicks, and a
pet terrapin. Most of these visits were del ghtful experiences for the
children, except that the kitten refused to use the shavings (I'm assuming
that you know that old ditty about the old cat who covered it up with

his paw). We made the mistake of letting the sweet, gentle, little darling
kitty roam around the school room~~~so--**33*. (But I‘ll leave that part
of the experience out of the article.)

I feel, to be of help to teachers, I'd have to make a practical approach

to the visits, and that will take some time to get it well written and

the may I want it. I know what teachers want and can deem-and actually
there are ten helps tor Primary teachers. The idea of an animal visiting
day occuredito me when I hecame disgusted at the usual Pet Show, which
many primary teachers have. There is too much commotion, and not enough
attention. observation (scientific) or care to give the children the
experiences which would he helplul to them. Yv’r'Te enjoyed our tirst exper~
ience in this idea so much that I want to do it on a much larger scale next
year. We will have a larger classroom in our new annex and some outdoor
facilities which we lacked this year.

Please give me another year hefore I c

an come up with anything * “ ’
. . ,. v 1 aortrmhi

Social Responsibility
and Pets

The Purpose of This Guide

This Leaders Guide is intended to help youth group
leaders develop a dynamic training program in civic
and social responsibility based on youngsters’ deep in-
terest in pets.

Most youngsters love animals. Pets are a real part of
their lives. Young people’s interest in pets thus becomes
a natural vehicle for youth leaders who are seeking to
provide youngsters with meaningful experiences in
social responsibility and good citizenship.

There are many activities involving pets which your
group or organization can carry out which will help
develop a sense of civic and social responsibility in the
young people participating. This Guide suggests many
such activities.

You may use these suggested activities in various
ways. They can constitute a continuous program for a
“Pets and People Club” — a club concerned with the
care and welfare of pets and of people in relation to
pets. Or, if you prefer, you may decide to carry out some
of the individual activities, without forming a pet club.
Not all of the activities outlined in this Guide will be
suitable for your group, since groups vary widely in age
level and interests. But we think you will find many of
them right for you.

How Children Develop Responsibility

Every youngster is growing in social understanding
and responsible behavior, whether he is a child of three
or four or a teenager. He develops from dependence on
others toward self-dependence; he grows from com—
plete absorption in self toward concern for others.
Growth toward independence and responsibility is de—
termined by the child’s physical, mental and emotional
development. He learns to recognize and assume re-
sponsibilities in areas that are significant for him and
within the limits of his abilities.

The Responsibilities
of Pet Ownership

One way for the child to learn the meaning of re-
sponsibility is to have something for which he is respon-
sible. The responsibilities of pet ownership fall within
the limits of the child’s experiences and interests and are
therefore meaningful to him.

Many boys and girls have pets of their own or live in
homes where there are pets. Owning and caring for a
pet puts a youngster immediately in a position of re-
sponsibility and authority. With a pet to care for, he
begins to learn, through experience, how and why to
perform certain tasks regularly. He learns to think of
the needs and comforts of another creature. The posi-
tive values of social responsibility inherent in pet owner-
ship can be emphasized so that young people begin to
understand the reasons behind the things they do as
they care for their pets.

Youngsters’ responsibilities for their pets naturally
will vary with their age. But at all ages they can be
made aware of the importance of the responsibilities
they can carry. Furthermore, with guidance and help,
they can assume increased responsibilities as they grow
and mature.

Pets and Responsibility
Toward the Community

Boys and girls soon discover — when their dog or
cat comes in contact with other people —- that caring for
a pet involves more than providing for his daily needs.
When his dog goes out without a leash on the busy city
sidewalk or his cat sits and howls on the backyard fence,
here is an opportunity for a youngster to learn about
the rights of other people.

Pets provide a way to give youngsters an under-
standing of what community life means and what re-

sponsibilities it entails. Using pets as a springboard,
they can learn how the community safeguards the we]-
fare of its individual members, and how, in turn, the
individual contributes to the community. They can
learn about the laws which the community has estab-
lished to safeguard pets and the people around them;
how and why such laws came into being; and their
obligation to obey these laws.

HOW TO USE PETS TO

Pets and Safety

Pets offer a practical way of developing in young—
sters a sense of responsibility about safety. Not only
must they consider the safety of the animals in their
care, but they must learn to develop greater responsi-
bility for their own safety and that of other people in
relation to pets.

DEVELOP RESPONSIBILITY

IN YOUNG PEOPLE

I. Form A Pets and People Club

A Pets and People Club can provide a focal point
for all your group activities involving pets. Membership
in the club would depend on your particular circum-
stances: it might be open to boys and girls who have
pets of any kind; or it might be restricted to owners of
one particular kind of pet — dogs or cats, for example;
or it might be open to all youngsters who are interested
in pets, regardless of whether or not they own one.

The following activities ideally would be carried out
by your pet club. Even if you decide not to form such a
club, you will still ﬁnd many of the individual activities
valuable for your group.

II. Suggested Activities Concerned With Pet Care

1. The Pets and People Club should concentrate ﬁrst
of all on learning all about dogs, cats, and other pets of
interest, and their care. The handbook, Experiences
With Pets, will provide basic information. Additional
material can be obtained from books and magazines
available in the school or public library, from the
American Humane Education Society (180 Longwood
Avenue, Boston 15, Massachusetts), and from the
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
mals (441 East 92nd Street, New York 28, New York).

2. Plan a varied program that will meet the needs
and interests of the entire group. Many humane socie-
ties are interested in junior pet clubs and your local
organization may be able to give your group valuable
help in program planning. Meetings may include
speakers, ﬁlms on pets and their care, pet problem
clinics, discussion and study sessions, trips.

3. Consult the experts. Ask adults with experience
in the care, breeding, or training of various pets, such
as, an owner, trainer, or breeder of pedigree dogs, cat
or bird breeder, veterinarian, pet store owner, or repre-
sentative of the local humane society, to talk to the club
or to give demonstrations on various phases of pet care
and training.

4. Develop a club constitution to show the purpose
of the club and to specify the responsibilities and duties
of the ofﬁcers and members of the club. (A sample con-
stitution for a pet club may be obtained from the
San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, Humane Education Department, 2500 16th
Street, San Francisco 8, California.)

5. Adopt a service project for the club year. Mem-
bers of a pet club may share their interest, enthusiasm,
and special knowledge about pets with other boys and
girls in the following ways:

0 Pet Advisory Service (Offer to answer questions
other youngsters have about care, feeding, or training
of their pets) I

0 Pet Care Campaign (Promote pet care through
posters, or presentation of special programs concern-
ing the care of pets, particularly at those special times
of the year when many children may be receiving
pets as gifts)

0 Books About Pets (Develop a list of easily available
books and articles about pet care for distribution to
other children)

0 Pet Care Information (Prepare a simple pamphlet on
the care and feeding of the most popular pets for dis-
tribution to interested pet owners)

Ill. Suggested Activities Concerned with Safety

In carrying out activities concerned with the wel-
fare and safety of pets and people, your group can get
valuable help by contacting the ofﬁce of the local animal
warden, the local ofﬁce of the Animal Welfare League
or the nearest chapter of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. They can help you plan a pro-
gram for your group on the basis of the needs of the
community and the interests and abilities of the mem-
bers of the group.

In concentrating on learning about animal welfare
and safety, the following areas should be explored:
standards of care and treatment of animals in captivity,

 

k???»

 

:waem




good manners for dogs and cats, neighborhood hazards
to the safety of dogs or cats, ﬁrst aid for injured animals,
ﬁrst aid for persons scratched or bitten by animals, the
laws and regulations of your community concerning the
control of dogs and other animals.

The following are speciﬁc activities you may under-
take:

1. Find out what the laws controlling pet ownership
are in your town and city. Find out about licensing reg-
ulations, fees, and requirements concerning leashes,
muzzles, and fences.

2. Discuss the dog laws in your community and
determine if they seem adequate and fair to both the
pet owner and the public.

8. Have a committee interview the local animal
warden or invite him to visit the Pets and People Club
to explain his duties and responsibilities.

4. Prepare a brief summary of local and State laws
pertaining to pets and make it available to other inter-
ested youngsters.

5. Have open discussion meetings where young
people can discuss such questions as this: “Do pet
owners have additional responsibilities toward the com-
munity in addition to those imposed bylaw?”

6. Prepare a checklist of safe and lawful practices
dog owners should follow. For instance, dogs should be
walked on a leash, and curbed to keep sidewalks clean.

7. Ask youngsters to survey the neighborhoods in
which they live and rate the neighborhood safety-wise,
using the checklist developed above.

8. Prepare a chart to show the safety hazards own-
ing a pet may present and indicate the precautions pet
owners should take to eliminate each hazard.

9. Plan and carry out a campaign program in pet
safety: “Making Our Community Safe for Pets and
People.”

10. Prepare an original skit on the theme: “Safety
and Your Dog” for presentation at a parent program
during National Safety Week.

11. Invite a local veterinarian to give a demonstra-
tion to the group on ﬁrst aid treatment for an injured

dog.

IV. Hold A Citizenship and Pets Conference
for Youngsters

A Conference on Citizenship and Pets, in which the
participants are youngsters, can be a culminating ac-
tivity for the program of your Pets and People Club,
or it can be carried out as an independent project.

The purpose of such a conference would be:

1. To promote an understanding of the laws con-
cerning pets and their protection.

2. To promote the welfare of pets and other animals
in your community.

3. To learn the techniques for dealing with com-
munity problems involving differences of opinion,
points of View, and interests of other people, by making
use of the case study approach.

GETTING STARTED

A conference on Citizenship and Pets may be organ-
ized on a community-wide or city-wide basis. Participa-
tion may be limited to young people of a certain age or
grade, or it may be open to boys and girls of all ages,
with special meetings and workshop experiences avail-
able at various levels. Speakers and workshop leaders
may be drawn from the community. Suggested confer-
ence leaders include veterinarian, pet store owner, ani-
mal warden, ofﬁcial of the Humane Society or Animal
Welfare League, trainer or breeder of dogs, ofﬁcial of
local zoo or children’s museum.

CONFERENCE THEME

Your own theme will depend upon the needs and
interests of your community. Suggested conference
themes include: Safety and Your Pet, Pet Ownership
and Community Responsibility, Making Our Town Safe
for Dogs, Our Responsibility toward Wild Birds and
Animals, Protecting and Caring for Animals in Our
Town.

SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES

1. Speakers, ﬁlms, demonstrations concerning the
care and training of dogs, cats, and other pets.

2. Demonstration of ﬁrst aid techniques, dog obe-
dience training, construction of animal shelters and
cages

8. Speakers to explain the laws and regulations in
your community concerning dogs: laws about strays,
regulations regarding the use of the leash, curbing,
licensing, immunization requirements, regulation con-
cerning lost dogs, liability of dog owners whose dog
destroyed personal property, and laws regarding the
disposition of dogs that have bitten someone.

4. Trips to a nearby animal shelter, veterinary hos—
pital, or animal farm.

5. Discussions around topics such as: Why we have
laws for animals. Do pet owners have additional respon-
sibilities toward the community beside those imposed
by law? Who should be responsible for the safety of
animals in a community?

6. Workshops using a case study approach to help

mmw meﬁi®mw

 




young people learn to develop skills in planning for
themselves and others, and to give them experience in
recognizing a community problem, ﬁnding the facts,
forming opinions, evaluating information, and deter-
mining action for the future.

Here are three problem situations which might be
typical of the kind of problems young people would
wish to develop and consider in workshop groups:

Case Study #1

Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell and their two children,
Charles 12, and Kathy, 10, lived in their own house in a
suburban area. The children wanted a dog very badly,
and though their parents did not really want one, they
ﬁnally bought a Cooker Spaniel. At first, the children
played with the dog a great deal and enjoyed taking
care of him. After a couple of months, however, the
novelty of owning a dog wore off, and the children lost
interest in taking care of him. The dog roamed the
neighborhood. He was not kept clean and he was fed
at irregular intervals. The parents wanted to give the
dog away, but the children objected violently.

Finally, the parents decided to pretend the dog was
“lost.” Actually, they drove to a spot several hours from
home, and abandoned the dog there. They h0ped he
would be adopted by some kind family, but of course
they had no way of knowing what actually happened
to him.

STEP-BY—STEP ANALYSIS

a. Identify the difﬁculties and problems of the Max-
wells and their dog. What were their responsibilties
and how did they fail to meet them?

b. Why was their solution wrong?

. What other solutions were possible?

Case Study #2

Carol and John lived in a small town in California.
They were delighted when their grandfather gave them
a lively little white puppy named Tippy. Tippy grew
quickly and soon learned to follow Carol and John
all over the neighborhood. He never ran after cars or
snapped at the other children. He never bothered the
beautiful flower garden in his back yard. When Tippy
felt like burying a bone, he always ran into the Smith’s
yard next door.

STEP-BY—STEP ANALYSIS

. What do Carol and John think of Tippy’s activities?

. What do the Smiths think of Tippy’s activities?

. What is the problem? Suggest solutions to the situa-
tion.

. Evaluate the solutions, and develop a plan for deal-
ing with the problem to the satisfaction of John and
Carol and of the Smiths.

Case Study #3

When Joey lived in the country, his dog, Butch,
would run behind him wherever Joey went, whether he
was hiking through the woods, or just walking down the
road to visit the neighbors.

When Joey moved to Pittsburgh, Butch missed his
long walks through the woods. He developed the excit-
ing habit of chasing after the automobiles that zoomed
up and down the street. Butch never got hurt, and Joey
thought it was great fun when a driver would slam on
the brakes and come to a screeching stop in order to
avoid hitting the playful and friendly dog.

STEP-BY—STEP ANALYSIS

a. Who is in danger? How?

b. What should be done?

0. Who has the responsibility to do something?
d. What should a driver on Joey’s street do?

e. What should Joey do?

f. Are there laws that cover this situation?

g. What is the law in your city or town?

Case Study #4

Present a problem involving pets existing in your
community for analysis and discussion by the group,
using the above problem—solving technique.

Smaller, rural communities may not have adequate
laws for the protection of pets or of people. People in-
terested in the welfare of animals in some communities
feel that the present laws governing certain animals in
their town or state are unfair or unwise. If new laws
concerning pets are being proposed in a town or city, it
becomes the concern of all responsible citizens. If the
issue is controversial, boys and girls should know how
to go about ﬁnding out the facts in order to form their
own opinions.

Pets and People is a youth-service program of the Dog Care Division

of the Ralston Purina Company, manufacturer of Purina Dog Chow.

 

 




 

too long in a fenced yard or Wire run. The dog
gets bored and barks at anything going by.

The solution is to walk your dog early in the
morning and late at night, and to keep him in the
house during the day. Put him in the fenced yard
or wire run only when he needs to go there for
relief . . . and see to it that he keeps quiet when
he is outside.

If he barks for no good reason while you are walk-
ing him or during the day, there are various ways
to check him. Scolding is usually enough. Or if
sterner, treatment is called for, you may have to
whack him. Or turn the hose on him. He will
soon learn that silence pleases you and earns him
a reward.

a deadly game

Chasing cars and bicycles may seem like a game
to your dog—but it can be a deadly game. His
very life is at stake, and he can easily cause serious
accidents, etc.

So teach your dog not to leave the yard, regardless
of what temptations beckon in the shape of a
passing car or bike. And since there are times
when you and your dog will be away from home,
and the yard limits won’t hold, teach him that
he must never, never chase any vehicle.

How do you train your dog to stay within the
yard? It is better to start when he is a young
puppy. Put a strong, lightweight cord on the dog
and ask someone to call him from outside the
yard, or to walk another dog past him. Then when
your dog leaps in pursuit, let him reach the yard
limit, then pull back hard on the cord and cry
“nol”. Repeat this procedure again and again on
all boundaries of the yard.

When you are sure the dog understands his yard
limits, remove the rope and repeat the same pro-
cedure. This time when he goes outside the limits,
scold him and chase him back into the yard. Once
he is back in the yard, pet him, saying “good dog”

.MO» .5

    

to teach him that he will have your approval as
long as he stays within bounds.

A similar method works in teaching your dog not
to chase cars. Again use a long rope, and enlist
the cooperation of someone with a car. As the car
goes by and your dog starts to chase it, yank
him back and scold him. Remember scolding or
light punishment will do your dog no harm; a car
may kill him. A few hours training will add years
to your enjoyment of each other’s company.

friend or foe?

We have all heard tales of heroic dogs who have
given their lives to protect their owners’ lives and
property.

This protective and loyal instinct in dogs is a
ﬁne quality. But the dog owner must teach his
dog early to distinguish between friends and ene-
mies. It is up to the dog owner to teach his pet
not to bark at, or bite, postmen, meter readers,
and other service people.

Whenever possible, give your dog a chance to get
acquainted with the mailman and others who serve
you regularly. Tell the mailman the dog’s name,
and have him give the dog a cookie, so they can
get acquainted and recognize each other as friends.

Other service people, such as meter readers, are
less frequent visitors, and so it is not possible to
have your dog know all of them. It is important,
therefore, to teach your dog that he can bark at
strange Visitors only until you take over, and that
he must then back off and be quiet.

if your dog is a female...

If your dog is a female, you have a special problem.
When she is in heat (twice a year for about three
weeks at a time), male dogs will be constantly
under foot, ﬁghting, howling and otherwise annoy-
ing you—and your neighbors—in their attempts
to court her.

What you do about the situation depends on
whether you want your dog to have puppies. If
you don’t want her to have puppies, take her to
a veterinarian and have her spayed. This is a sim-
ple operation and will eliminate the “female in
heat” problem entirely, with no harm to your dog.

The alternative to spaying your dog is to keep
a close watch on her for the entire time she is in
heat. You may decide to put her in a good board-

8

ing kennel during this time. This will eliminate
the possibility of a litter of unwanted, mixed-breed
puppies, and the problem of being besieged by
male dogs. Your neighbors will deeply appreciate
your thoughtfulness.

If you do not wish to board your dog in a kennel,
then you should plan to keep her in the house
almost constantly during this time. When it’s nec-
essary to take her out, be sure to keep her on a
short leash and take along a cane to frighten off
male dogs. Or better still, drive to some secluded
area or vacant lot, where you can let her exercise,
but never oﬁr the leash. Only when her heat period
is over and she is no longer attractive to males,
should you relax your vigilance.

feeding your dog

Dogs are individuals just as humans are. Puppies
from the same litter will differ in both their feed
and water requirements. A good rule in feeding
grown dogs is: give one half ounce of dry food,
like Purina Dog Chow, per pound of dog per day.
Thus, a 32 pound dog would get 16 ounces or a
pound of dry dog food daily.

 

The preceding rules for dog owners are the result of 30 continuous
years of research by the Ralston Purina Company and are recom-
mended for the use of all dog owners.

KNOW YOUR VETERINARIAN

The day to day enjoyment of your dog will depend
a great deal on his good health. It is of prime
importance to you and him. Consult your Veter-
inarian on any health problems that may arise
and follow his recommendations. He has had years
of specialized training in the diagnosis and treat-
ment of animal diseases. You can rely upon him
to give you the beneﬁt of his knowledge and in-
terest in your pet’s welfare.

Ask for and follow your Veterinarian’s advice on
inoculations for Rabies, Distemper, etc., as well
as treatment of routine doggy ailments. He’s a
good man to know!

I “Love me, love my dog” is a saying familiar to
most of us. Many dog owners feel very strongly
about their pets and lavish a great deal of affection
on them, expecting everyone else to share their
feelings. They simply cannot understand why the
people down the street, who seem quite nice other-
wise, get so upset over neighbors’ dogs running
through their yard. Unfortunately, dogs are all too
frequently a source of neighborhood annoyances.

I Johnny rides down the street on his bike when
suddenly a large dog streaks out from nowhere.
Barking loudly, he jumps at the bike. Johnny falls
off and sprains his ankle.

I Mrs. Smith is very proud of her trim, well-kept
yard. She has spent many hours seeding, weeding
and mowing it. One afternoon she ﬁnds her neigh-
bor’s terrier busily digging a hole for his bone in
her ﬂower bed.

I Dogs roaming about the streets create constant
problems for city ofﬁcials.

I In apartment buildings permitting pets, tenants
have their nerves shattered by a dog that howls
whenever he’s left alone.

These are not isolated cases, but irritating situa-
tions which occur again and again. It’s true that
dog is “man’s best friend” and most beloved pet.
But he can also become a neighborhood pest—
if a thoughtless owner allows him to.

the responsibility is yours

As a dog owner you know the companionship,
the loyalty and love, the pleasure and sheer fun
that your dog adds to your life. But there are
many dog owners who do not realize that with
every right goes a corresponding duty. Dog owners
must consider their responsibilities toward their
neighbors and toward their communities. If they
don’t, they are not “good dog neighbors.”

Your dog does not have a sense of civic responsi-
bility, so you have to think for him. Put yourself
in your neighbors’ place and try to imagine how
your dog’s habits affect them. It’s up to you to
train your dog early so that you will enjoy each
other without spoiling the enjoyment of others.

If you own a dog or are planning to own one,
this leaﬂet will tell you how to be a “good dog
neighbor”—how to make sure your pet doesn’t
become a pest. Your neighbors will be happier—
and so will you and your dog.

The 00’s and Don’ts of Dog Ownership

DON’T...

’ I let your dog roam the neighborhood

I let your dog bark excessively

I let your dog soil your neighbor’s shrub-
bery or lawn, or tear up his flower
garden

I let your dog chase cars or bicycles

I let your dog frighten or bite the post-
man, milkman, or other service people

I let your leashed dog lunge at or jump
on passers-by

I let your dog howl for hours while you
are gone

DO...

I teach your dog to be obedient and well-
behaved

I walk your dog on a leash and curb him
when necessary

I teach him to stay in your yard

I train your dog to stay quietly within
his kennel or crate while you are away

I train your dog to walk quietly at heel
on a loose leash

 

 

 

walking your dog: sense and nonsense

How often have you heard someone say that dogs
need lots of exercise, or that the city is no place
for a dog because dogs need lots of space to roam
in, or that a dog needs to wander wherever he
wishes in order to be happy?

Good sense? Sheer nonsense! Dogs don’t need a
lot of exercise. They don’t need to be outdoors
I .r * ' all day, nor do they want
to be. Your dog likes to

be with you. If you want

to walk, your dog will go

along joyously. But if

you prefer to sit and

read, your dog will be

happy to lie beside you.

Dogs who roam the neighborhood usually do so
because they are ignored by their owners. They
get bored and form the habit of roaming about.
And once the habit is formed, it is hard to break.
So don’t let your dog begin.

3
III-IIIIIIIIIIIIII

When you do take your dog for his walk, make
sure you follow some simple rules which will very
soon become good habits.

One simple rule is to curb your dog. It’s an easy
matter to draw your dog to the curb when he is
about to relieve himself. Since dogs catch on to
this rule in a day or two, there is just no reason
to break it.

Many cities have laws which claim public right
over the lawn between sidewalk and street. That
area is usually called the tree lawn. But the prop-
erty owner is still required to keep the area neat
and clean. Dog owners who allow their dogs to
soil the tree lawn may be within the letter of the
law but they certainly aren’t within the spirit of
good neighborliness.

A second basic rule is to teach your dog to walk
quietly at heel on a loose leash. If there’s an obedi-
ence training class where owners are taught to
train their own dogs, by all means join it. Your
veterinarian or pet supplier can usually tell you
how to contact such a class.

Teaching your dog to walk quietly by your side
eliminates all sorts of trouble. It means your dog
won’t jump on people, won’t scratch or frighten
them. It means he won’t lunge at other dogs. The
daily walk will turn into a treat for both of you
instead of a chore for you and a disciplining
session for your dog.

But what if other wandering dogs, not as well
trained as yours, attack your dog? If you know
that this is likely to occur on certain streets, the
simplest solution would be to change the route
of your walk.

A cane or stick may be necessary to ward off
strange dogs. Although, if the dog gets within cane
reach of your dog, he may be too close to prevent
a ﬁght. And he may attack you in self-defense.
Noise will frighten dogs away, so you can throw
a “throw chain” near an aggressive dog. Its prin-
cipal value is the noise it makes which will frighten
away an unwelcomed dog. Throw chains can be
purchased at most good pet stores.

So remember: Walk your dog on a leash and don’t
allow him to roam at will. Train him to walk
quietly at your heel. Curb him when he has to go.
Your dog will take pleasure in pleasing you, and
your neighbors will love you both!

4
III-IIIIIIIIIIIIII

yard manners

Even the friendliest of neighbors will be resentful
and angry if the dog next door wanders unchecked
all over their lawn, soils their yard, and tears up
their lawn or ﬂowers.

A dog isn’t born with yard manners and probably
has no idea the neighbors will object to his activi-
ties. Or if he knows from painful experience that
they do, he doesn’t understand why.

So the solution is up to you.

It’s quite normal for a dog not to soil his own
yard. So, unless you ﬁnd an alternative, he’ll go
to the neighbor’s lawn.

Teach your dog to use only a certain portion of
your own yard—behind or beside the garage, or
out behind the shrubbery. You can do this by
placing some of his droppings there, then taking
him to that spot when you know it is necessary.
When he relieves himself there, praise him.

Meanwhile, spray any other yard spot he has used
previously with a good commercial deodorant. The
smell will keep your dog away from those areas,
and he will start using the area you have chosen
for him.

If you fence the area you have selected, you can
leave your dog there for an hour or so at regular
times each day.

To keep this area clean, droppings should be dis-
posed of regularly. They can be placed in the street
sewer or used in your garden as manure. Various
scoop—type gadgets are sold which make it easy
to pick up and dispose of the droppings.

when a bark is as bad as a bite...

Have you ever had your blood curdled by what
sounded like a human being in anguish, only to
discover it was a dog wailing? There are few

5
III-IIIIIIIIIIIIII

things as hard on the
nerves and temper as
listening to a dog howl-
ing, barking, whining or
moaning for hours at a
stretch. Yet this is ex-
actly what some dog
owners put their neigh-
bors through. This dis-
turbance of the peace is the quickest and most
common way to become a bad dog neighbor.

Barking while you are away. Dogs who behave
while their owners are at home, but howl con-
tinuously when they are absent, have usually been
badly spoiled. They are accustomed to constant
companionship, and consequently feel injured
when they ﬁnd themselves left alone at home.

 

To cure this bad howling habit, you must accus-
tom your dog to staying quietly alone in one room
when you put him there. Start his training some
weekend morning when someone will be on hand
all day. After the dog has had his morning exercise,
put him alone in a room and shut the door. If he
howls, make him stop it at once. Usually scolding
is sufﬁcient, or you may try banging a ﬂat piece
of wood on the door to emphasize your command
to “be quiet!” Occasionally, it may be necessary
to punish him by slapping him lightly under the
chin. After an hour or so, if he has been quiet,
let him come out.

After the dog has had an hour of liberty, put him
back into the room, then release him again after
another hour of good behavior. Repeat this all
day, and by evening, the dog will have learned
that he must stay quietly in a room alone. If you
live in a small apartment and do not have a spare
room, try the same procedure by having your dog
stay quietly in a box or kennel instead of in a room.

Once your dog has learned this, it is a simple
step to accustom him to remain quietly by himself
while you are away. For a few times, you will
have to return after leaving the house to ﬁnd out
if he is behaving. If he is barking, punish him.
Soon your efforts will be rewarded and your dog
will learn to be quiet during your absence. NOTE:
Always leave some of the dog’s favorite toys in
the room for him to play with.

Barking when you are at home. What about the
dog who barks excessively even when his owner
is home? This usually occurs when a dog is kept

and carries on constant research to make it even better. For
more than 30-years, Purina scientists have studied dog nutri-
tion and dog care, with the aim of developing the best dog
food possible. When you buy Purina Dog Chow, you’re buy-
ing your dog the tastiest, most complete and well-balanced
diet that science can devise.

feeding facts and training
tips to help keep your dog
healthy and happy

If your dog is well fed, and well-cared for, he's
likely to be strong and healthy. if he’s well
trained, he'll be responsive, obedient, and
properly~behaved.

Here are important feeding and training sug—
gestions to help you take better care of your
dog.

And «- here also are two especially useful
forms which will provide you with a permanent
record of your dog’s vital statistics and medi-
cal history. Be sure to fill them out and save
this booklet for ready reference. Should your
dog become sick or get lost, you’ll find that
this record is invaluable.

This booklet is made available by the Dog Care Division of

the Ralston Purina Company, manufacturer of Purina Dog Chow.

Feeding your dog can—and should—be a simple daily
routine. Here are a few basic do’s and don’ts that every
dog-owner should know.

he sure you are providing a nutritious, well-balanced
diet. Your pet’s health, his appearance, even how long he
will live, depend in part on what you feed him.

try to set up a regular feeding time and feeding place.
It doesn’t really matter what time or what place. Let it
suit your convenience, but once you have decided, be
consistent.

keep fresh water available in a special place at all
times.

overfeed. One meal a day is enough for your full-
grown dog. How much you should feed your dog depends
on his size, his appetite and how active he is. If he regu-
larly leaves part of his meal, or shows a tendency to be-
come fat, cut down on the quantity you feed him.

feed your pet rich, spicy or greasy foods, heavy
starches, or sweets. Even milk and eggs may disagree
with him.

give your dog chicken or chop bones or any other
small bones that might splinter and lodge in his throat or
digestive tract. If you want to give your dog a bone (and
they are not essential), be sure it’s a large, strong bone—
a knuckle or shank bone, for instance.

feed your dog snacks or tid-bits between meals,
except as rewards in training him. Between-meal snacks
will spoil your pet’s appetite.

—- A dog’s ﬁrst loyalty is usually
to the person who feeds him.

We come now to the basic question: what should you feed
your dog? More and more people have come to realize
that the best and easiest way to provide their dog with a
well-balanced diet is to use one of the scientiﬁcally pre-
pared dog foods. You can depend on a good prepared
dog food to provide everything your dog needs in his diet;
table scraps are at best a hit-or-miss proposition.

There are two basic types of dog food: dry and canned.
Many people mistakenly believe that the dry foods are
cereals and the canned foods are meat. This is not so.
Both kinds contain meat proteins, but in the dry foods,
such as Purina Dog Chow, the water has been removed,
giving your dog more protein at a lower price per pound.

Thousands of hours of research have gone into the devel-
opment of Purina Dog Chow, and hundreds of dogs were
raised on it before it was made available to you. This food
is the choice of informed pet owners not only because of
its high quality ingredients, but because it is:

l. Economical—«contains more food value per pound
than lean meat
2. Easy to store—needs no refrigeration

3. Easy to serve—either dry or moistened with plain
water

4. Tasty and highly palatable—dogs love it

5. Nutritionally complete-you don’t need to feed
your dog anything else.

Give your dog Purina Dog Chow and the only question
left unanswered is how much does your pet need daily.
The feeding chart on each bag of Purina Dog Chow is a
good guide. But take into account your dog’s individual
appetite and how active he is.

TRAINING TIPS 4:"

Is your dog a constant source of joy to you, or do you
occasionally ﬁnd him a nuisance? The answer depends
on you. As every dog-owner knows, dogs make wonderful
pets. They are loyal, affectionate, and fun to have around.
They are good company—but only if they are well-trained.

You owe it to your pet to help him become an accept-
able and well-mannered member of his home, and a self-
respecting citizen of the community. Just having a dog in
your home does not qualify you automatically as a respon-
sible master. Just as a written law requires you to license
your dog, an unwritten law urges you to educate him in
good manners for indoor and outdoor living.

What should you teach your dog? Outdoors, he must
learn to: accept the leash when necessary; stay off other
people’s property; use the curb and keep the sidewalks
clean in the city; keep barking to a minimum; not chase
cars. Indoors, he must learn: housebreaking; to keep off
furniture; to teethe on his own toys; to refrain from
bothering guests; to refrain from begging and barking.

You will ﬁnd it easy to teach your dog to behave, but
start soon. Begin gentle training as soon as your dog is
adjusted to his new environment, and he will soon learn
to obey you.

SIX KEY WORDS

Your dog should learn to understand and to respond to six key
words —— HEEL, SIT, STAY, COME, DOWN and STAND.
Once he understands and obeys these words, you will be able
to control him in almost any situation. He will learn them
quickly, too, if you follow these suggestions:

1. Set aside 15 or 20 minutes every day—if possible at the
same hour. Never skip a day if you can help it.

2. Be consistent. Follow the same routine at each session.
Don’t confuse your dog by changing commands for an
exercise.

3. Reward your pet when he shows the slightest progress.
A reward can be praise alone or a tidbit of food. Keep a
handful of Purina Dog Chow in your pocket and he’ll
soon learn it’s worthwhile to perform well.

4. Keep it fun—don’t get exhausted, irritable, or impatient.

Repetition is necessary in teaching your dog. Soon he will
learn, and you will feel well rewarded for your efforts.

THE MAGIC WORDS AND HOW TO TEACH THEM

HEEL: With your dog at your left side, hold the leash in both
hands, leaving enough slack for corrections. Say the dog’s name,
then “heel” and start walking. To keep him with you, give ﬁve
short, sharp jerks with your left hand and repeat the HEEL
command. After a few lessons, vary your speed and practice
sudden changes in direction to keep your dog alert.

SIT: Dog is at your left side, the leash held entirely in your right
hand. Say his name and the word “sit.” Pull back and up on
the leash with the right hand, while pressing down with the left
hand on the dog’s rump.

STAY: Put dog in the SIT position. Give the command “stay”
and very slowly walk out a few steps. If he moves to follow you,
use the leash to snap him back to position. Gradually increase
your distance and the time you wait before returning to heel.

COME: In a world of many distractions it is vital to most owners
that their dogs respond quickly when called. To teach, put your
dog in a SIT-STAY position and walk out to the end of the
leash. In a happy manner call his name and “come.” If he
comes in at once, praise him lavishly and have him SIT in front
of you. If he remains sitting, praise him quietly.

DOWN: Put your dog in a SIT-STAY position. Stand in front
and close to him, with your right foot over a loose leash. Say
“Down” and slowly pull the leash tight. A quiet dog may be
helped along by pushing down on the shoulders. Once he is
down, say “stay.”

The boisterous dog, and most puppies are, needs the command
DOWN to prevent them from jumping on people, and making
general pests of themselves.

STAND: While heeling, take a long step forward, turn towards
the dog, bringing the right hand in front of his muzzle, palm
pointing in. Say “Stand-Stay.” If he starts to sit, slip your left
hand under his right rear leg and urge him up as you repeat the
STAND command. This can also be taught from a SIT position
by pulling gently forward with the leash in the right hand and
again using the left to bring the hindquarters up. Signal and
command are the same.

When your pet has learned to respond to these six words,
he will have earned his diploma and you will really
deserve your title of Trainer!

THE KINDNESS CLUB

N AN ARTICLE published in this maga

zine just two years ago, the Kindness

Club was launched. Since that time it
has attracted attention on four continents,
and hundreds of branches have been
formed in Canada and in the United
States, a few in Britain and New Zealand,
with inquiries coming in from Africa and
India.

The ATLANTIC A VOCATE

A Progress Report

by AIDA FLEMMING

Why this rapid spread of a club meant
originally for the children of Fredericton ?
The answer must be that the children
themselves want it. “Out came the chil-
dren running” when they heard the magic
music in the word—kindness. “The minute
I heard the name, I wanted to Join,” one
little boy said. Adults who have had the
happy experience of helping children form

14

a Kindness Club ﬁnd it e sy to agree with
the ﬁndings of a recent survey made by
the University of Illinois which states that
the average child’s most basic interest is
in animals, and not in sport, recreation,
machines or applied science as many
parents and teachers suppose.

For this natural interest children take
in animals, the Kindness Club provides

DECEMBER 1961

 




an ideal outlet. They like the way it is
organized with each Branch taking the
name of a bird or an animal, and the
adult adviser being known as the Racoon
Captain. At meetings, they like to be
addressed as Beaver Bill or Chipmunk
Cathy, or whatever it may be, as each
member is called by his Christian name
preﬁxed by the name of his Branch. Rules
for the club have been carefully formulated
so as to give members all the responsibility
they will take; to encourage them to adopt
a local project which will help animals
and birds; and incidentally, to teach them
how properly to conduct a meeting.

The prayer of the Kindness Club is:

Dear Father, hear and bless
Thy beasts and singing birds
And guard with tenderness
Small things that have no words.

Its pledge is: I promise to be kind to
animals (as well as people) and to speak
and act in defence of all helpless living
creatures.

The motto is: Be Kind!

To become a member, each child signs
the above pledge, and sells one packet of
Kindness Club hasti-notes or Christmas
cards, which sell twelve for sixty-nine
cents in a cellophane-wrapped package.
The purpose of selling Kindness Cards is
twofold: in the ﬁrst place, sales help pay
for supplies, which are numerous, ex-
pensive (though printed without proﬁt),
and all free to members; and secondly,
every card sent by anyone, anywhere,
helps spread the gospel of kindness.

The purpose of the Club is to induce
children (and grown—ups) to think about
being kind to every creature that lives
and suffers just as we do; and to ﬁnd out
how to be kind by learning everything
possible about the needs and natures of
animals and birds. For it is certainly true
that a great deal of cruelty is due to
thoughtlessness and ignorance. Club ac-
tivities cultivate in members habits of
kindness by constantly providing them
with opportunities to do kind things. The
Kindness Club is the positive approach
to the prevention of cruelty. Its method
is humane education.

What exactly is humane education? It
is the “impressing on the receptive minds
of boys and girls those principles of love,
compassion and kindness on which the
security and permanence of civilized so-
ciety depend.” May it not be because we
have not been giving highest priority in
our homes, our churches and our schools
to humane education that we are now
being threatened with the wiping out of
all civilized life on earth?

Perhaps there is still time. Senator F. A.
McGrand, president of the Federated
Humane Societies of Canada, says: “The
Creator placed man on earth as His
steward to administer this earthly domain
with reason, justice and mercy. And now

The ATLANTIC ADVOCATE

at long last, in this hazardous atomic age,
is man beginning to realize that, ulti-
mately, there can be no respect for human
life if there is no respect for life itself?”

There is increasing general uneasiness
that in some schools today a programme
is being conducted at great expense to
the taxpayer in education for delinquency.
For this reason, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
recently wrote as follows to the president
of the National Parent—Teachers’ Associa-
tion in the United States: “I would like
to join with those who sympathize with
the principles of humane education and
urge you to include a discussion on this
vital matter and reinstate humane educa-
tion on the programme of the P.T.A. It

seems to me of greatest importance to

teach our children respect for life. Toward
this end, experiments on living animals in
classrooms should be stopped. To en-
courage cruelty—-in the name of science——~
can only destroy the ﬁner emotions of
affection and sympathy and breed an un-
feeling callousness in the young toward
suffering in all living creatures.”

The racoon is the emblem of the Kindness
Club

On the other hand, encouraging chil-
dren to think about being kind and to do
kind things is bound to make them hap-
pier—and better—human beings. Already
there have been many speciﬁc instances
of children considered delinquents whose
outlook has been changed through mem-
bership in the Kindness Club. Such young
people are helped by being accepted as
part of a group, and quickly learn from
other members that it is the bully who is
the coward, and the kind boy or girl
willing to stand up for the helpless, who
is truly courageous and worthy of ad-
miration.

When the Kindness Club was founded
it was hoped that funds from card sales
would make it possible to put full-time
humane education workers in the ﬁeld
available at all times to visit groups of
children in schools, youth organizations,
and playgrounds to organize projects
which would inculcate habits of kindness
and, at the same time, be educational and
entertaining. This project is still far from
fulﬁlment as card sales do not as yet begin
to pay for club supplies, let alone salaries
for ﬁeld workers.

The ideal, of course, is to have teachers
whose hearts are in humane education
Visiting classrooms regularly as an integral

16

part of the school system. In the meantime,
we have an excellent example of a co-
operative effort between the schools and
the SPCA. in Hamilton, Ontario, where
Miss Evelyn Burgess, educational secre-
tary of the S.P.C.A., carries on a wonder—
ful programme for the students. She
writes: “Again this year, we have over
30,000 Junior Humane members . . . This
year in the schools, my talks have been
used as tests for essays right through the
grades and one Inspector was amazed at
the amount the kiddies in the kinder-
garten retained. There is a poster contest
going on now and the children’s general
interest in the prevention of cruelty is
high. . . I am amazed at the general
apathy (among adults) about a subject
which I consider the very ﬁnest for
character building.”

A few comments on the Kindness Club
give some idea of how it is being received
by a variety of people. The Humane
Society of the United States writes: “It
is the best thing of its kind which has
yet come to our notice. We will suggest
to children who write us that they get in
touch with headquarters in Fredericton
and form a Kindness Club.”

A Racoon Captain from Port Credit,
Ontario, says: “Our Kindness Club has
twelve charming and enthusiastic mem-
bers. I hope to have a second club started
before Christmas. This is the kind of work
I can put my whole heart into.”

A young member from West Sunbury,
Pennsylvania, comments: “I enjoy being
a member of this wonderful Club. When
I grow up, don’t be surprised when some
day you hear that an Animal Shelter has
been built in the hills of West Sunbury
County by me—Linda Chaﬁl”

A business man from Los Gatos, Cali-
fornia, writes: “The simplicity and good-
ness of the Kindness Club idea make me
believe that something like it can get
going everywhere very soon. Send me the
supplies and I am willing to devote a
good deal of time to establishing it here.”

Dr. Harry Lillie, that great humani-
tarian and second Dr. Schweitzer, says
in a letter: “I certainly have not seen
anything to compare with the Kindness
Club and friends here in Britain are most
interested.”

Sister Veronice, O.S.F., well-known
educator of Washington, DC, who
teaches science to science teachers, refers
to the Kindness Club in a recent article
as follows: “One practical method that
Fredericton has instituted is the Kindness
Club, whose object is to inculcate the love
and knowledge of birds and animals into
the minds of children and to provide
funds for recreational and educational
activities along those lines, and for the
provision of animal shelters, bird boxes,
veterinarian services and other humane
work. The children raise funds by selling
packets of Kindness cards. Each branch

Peterson and Chris Williamson.

Club is named for a different animal or
bird, such as the Beaver, Eagle, Chip-
munk, Owl, etc. This type of activity is
one which appeals to the young pre-teens
and its object is worthy of consideration.”

To ensure that Kindness Club meetings
are educational as well as fun, a guide
book for leaders is now in the hands of
the publishers, Brunswick Press of Fred-
ericton. Each programme consists of a
true and original story told to entertain
and at the same time to point out that
animals are indeed worthy of our respect
and protection, followed by hints from
the various humane societies on how to
be kind, then a bit of nature poetry to

It has been said that the degree of
civilization which a community or a
country has attained is best judged by
the degree of humaneness it exercises in
its treatment of animals. Those who know
the facts will readily agree that in this
regard most North American communities
lag far behind Britain and the Scandinav-
ian countries. The Kindness Club is one
vehicle for the improvement of our
standards.

can win only when the majority of our
people are willing to join with Ruskin
in the following pledge: “I will not kill
or hurt any living creature needlessly,
nor destroy any beautiful thing, but will
strive to save and comfort all gentle life,
and guard all natural beauty upon the
earth.”

If it were not for the regrettable
example set by a great many adults, most
children would gladly set their feet on
the gentle path of conservation and com-
passion to follow the Call of Kindness
all the days of their lives.

IT’S EASY TO HOLD A PET FAIR—WITH A PET FAIR KIT

Here is a “blueprint” for holding a suc-
cessful Pet Fair, without fuss or strain. A
handbook on “How To Hold A Pet Fair,”
included in each Kit, tells you step by step
exactly what to do and how to do it.

What activities do you have at a Pet Fair?
Where do you hold it? How do you publicize
it? How are pets judged? What provision

should you make for the care of pets during
the Fair? The handbook gives you the an—
swers to these and other questions.

In addition you get all the basic program
materials you will need — everything from
a Pet Fair banner, posters and ribbons to
armbands for exhibitors and judges, and
sample press releases.

 

NOW AVAILABLE WITHOUT CHARGE TO YOUTH GROUPS—
SUCCESSFULLY USED FOR TWO YEARS IN THE SCHOOLS

The Pets and People Pet Fair Kit is being offered to
youth and recreation groups for the ﬁrst time, although
it has been used in schools for the past two years with
great success.

Thousands of teachers have found the Kit invalu-
able in helping them hold class or school Pet Fairs.
Because we have received so many requests for the
Kit from youth groups outside the schools, we are now
making the Pet Fair Kit available to these groups.

The Pet Fair Kit has been revised to meet the special
needs of youth and recreation groups, but it is basic-
ally the same Kit which has demonstrated its value in
thousands of school Pet Fairs.

HOW TO RECEIVE YOUR FREE PET FAIR KIT

Since the supply of Kits is limited, they are being
offered ﬁrst to youth and recreation leaders who have
already requested and received the Pets and People
Packet of resource materials on pets.

Please note: We can only supply one Kit for each
Pet Fair to be held.

If you are a recreation or playground supervisor, for
instance, and estimate that ﬁve different groups would
be interested in holding ﬁve different Pet Fairs, then
you may order ﬁve Pet Fair Kits. One Kit provides all

the material needed for one Pet Fair. In some cases,
we may have to send you fewer Kits than you request,
in order to ﬁll requests from as many groups as
possible.

To order your Kit or Kits, simply ﬁll out and mail
the attached postcard. Postage will be paid by us. Send
in your card today to assure prompt fulﬁllment of your
request.

Dear Youth Leader:

As a public service, the Ralston Purina Pets and People
Program wishes to offer you a free Pet Fair Kit, to help you
and your youngsters plan and carry out a Pet Fair.

 

Why hold a Pet Fair ? Because it's fun — fun for the
youngsters in your group, fun for the parents and visitors
who attend the Fair, fun for you and for others who help
supervise the Fair.

Because it's worthwhile. A Pet Fair is a c00perative
venture to which each youngster can contribute in some way,
and from which he can gain.

Because it's an experience you can share with your com-
munity. If you have ever wished you could get others to know
more and care more about your activities and objectives — then
hold a Pet Fair.

The Pet Fair Kit tells you exactly what to do and gives
you all the basic materials you need. No fuss or strain. The
enclosed brochure describes the Kit fully. It also tells you
about two leaflets on dog care which you may obtain without
charge in bulk quantities.

To order your free Pet Fair Kit, and/or c0pies of the
two leaflets, you need only fill out and mail the request card
in the enclosed brochure. We'll pay the postage. Order now
— requests will be filled in order of receipt.

Sincerely,

Z é/Zﬂm

6749:? faéiﬁfgrq LVN-1 ' itﬂp. Kai-”Jibjxﬁ, /

I wish to thank Mr. Siohel for the opportunity to take part in this
discussion of humane education. It is a matter which i eonsidsr totae of
the gravest importance in the development of our oivilizstion, and judging
by the survey we have recently been conducting of users of the manuals,
"First Aid and Care of Small Animals" and "Humane Bioloey Projects" which
we provide free to teachers, many 0” them feel the some way. A second grade
teacher says, "I think the teacher in our public schools is in a wonderful
position to advance the love and respect for life through sealinn with boys
and girls directly, teaching them the proper attitude toward small animals."
This simple ens ysis o” humane edu stion is expressed in a slightly different
way by another teacher. Speaking of ”the right: and value of these
creatures," she says, "In my teach: g of children ~ kindergsrten, AH,
Grl “couts, ens Cundey School, the understnedins ens desire to help these
animals and the resulting loss of fear and prejudice, are the things I
most strongly wish to impart." An answer from a child telling why she
likes "First Ale ans Care 0% Small Animals" says of the pictures, ”They
showed the true ways 0% the animals and expressed a wonderful feeling as if
the animals were our ow1 and we were experiencing tie actions of the snlmals.;
This comment shows the genuine feelings of symnethy that sentte developed 3
end that are, no doubt, in the minds f another teacher when he writes, ”I
believe we do not capitalize on kindness to animals enough."

Many teachers and Scout Leaders tell us that their “First Aid and Cafe
of Small Animals" is worn out with use. One of these says, “Parent s told
me of an increase in kindness to animals and birds in their own families.”
A principal cells it a "motivating book" used in ”several instances tolaring;
about a realization of humanity to.animals, especially in the case of
youngsters that I know to be rough with animals."

Turning to the high school level and the use of our manual "Humane

Biology Projects“ in receive repeated comments to the effect that students

learn to appreciate animal life more and are less_inclined to destroy

Although the interest of high school students in biological research
certainly is commendable and should be encouraged, living animals some-
times are mistreated in laboratory exercises . Such practices must be
condemned by all legitimate scientists who respect life and understand

research. There is no justification for conducting in the secondary school

an experiment which would cause pain to an animal.

Secondary school administrators should insist that every experiment

involving live animals fulfill at least the following conditions:

1 . No.experiment using live animals should be attempted unless
comfortable quarters, adequate food and water, and humane
treatment can be provided.

Such an experiment should have as a clearly defined objective

the teaching of some biological principle which can not be

taught effectively without animals .

Important collateral objectives of every such experiment should
be to train students in the prOper handling of animals and to teach
reverence for life in any form.

If the school faculty includes nobody with training in the proper
care of laboratory animals, the services of such a person on a
consulting basis should be sought. Often a local veterinarian is

happy to offer this kind of help .

18) Investigage the protection given to wild animals and birds in New
York State, in the nation at large. '
Examine the hunting and fishing laws(available from.your city clerk
or other office issuing licenses).

Tell the story of the beaver in New York State; of the elk; tie
moose; the passenger pigeon; the American egret —- stories with
happy endings, in some cases; with unhappy endings,in others.Tell

your story as a straight narrative or in the form of a radio playlet.

List the basic standards which a good sportsman lives up to when he
goes hunting.(0bserves the game laws,follows a wounded animal until

he overtakes it,respects private property,makes sure of what he is

shooting at, scorns being a game-hog,etc.) Illustrate with your own

cartoons,making this a group project.

Many,in both Europe and America,view hunting with disfavor,calling it
a "bloody sport." To what extent, in modern times,is this View
justified? Cite reasons.

‘At the same time,why has it become necessary to hunt certain species
of animals? (To reduce numbers,when.we have slaughtered the.predators.
Mountain lions were wiped out,for example --now we have an over-

abundance of deer.)

 




page 8.

20--continued.
In two parallel columns contrast hunting purposes and methods today

with those of colonial times,with those of the American Indians.

21) Make a report,with pictures,if possible,of the Federal'Wildlife
Refuge nearest to you.(The only one in this State is the Mbntezuma
Federal Wildlife Refuge near Seneca Falls,N.Y.)When was it established?

For what purpose? What work had to be done? How is it protected?

How many other Wildlife Refuges are there in the United States?

write to the U.S.Fish and Wildlife ServiceiWashington,D.‘3.for

information.

Compile a scrapébook on the topic of the National Parks of the United
States. What regulations are in force in these parks for the protec-

tion of wildlife? How are these regulations carried out?

If you have visited a National Park,tell the story of your visit to
your class-mates. Or invite someone in to describe such a visit and
to answer questions.

No fire~arms can be brought into a National Park.Why is there no
danger,from the human standpoint,in this strictly enforced regulation?

write to the National Parks Association,121h Sixteenth St.,NIW.,

washington,D.C.

22- continued:

Consult "Exploring (hr National Parks and Mhnuments" by Devereux

Butcher.

23) Find out what other types of wildlife refuges or sanctuaries are to
be found in.wa York State.

Name and locate the one nearest to your town.Who owns it? Who
manages it? Why was it established? What are the more noticeable species
of wildlife finding safety within its boundaries? What are some of the
difficulties of administration of these smaller areas in such a thickly
settled region as New Ybrk State?

Interview someone connected with such a sanctuary or an officer of
your local Audubon Society,Bird Club or Nature Club and report on your
findings.

Consult the Audubon Magazine or write to the National Audubon
Society,ll30 Fifth Ave.,New York 28,N.Y.

Investigate the business of trapping in your area and the extent of this
business in the country as a whole.

What species of animals are caught and killed in steel traps?

The lives of wild animals continually have to be taken,for one
reason or another.But it is not on these grounds that many humane-
minded people sharply criticize the use of steel traps.What are the

serious objections to such traps? (Slow and painful death for the

 




ZH- continued: page 10.
trapped animal; poor and valueless specimens often taken;domestic animals,
pheasants and undesired small animals are frequently caught.) Cite
instances. ‘

What are the two types of traps which would eliminate most Of these‘
~ criticisms? (Traps which hold the animal alive and unhurt; traps which
bring death at once.) ‘

i Set up a small exhibit of traps,including both the commonplace steel
trap and the humane types.

Write to Defenders of Furbearers,121h Sixteenth Street,N}W.,
Washington 6,D. C., and to the Wildlife Department,American Humane
Association,l35 Washington Ave.,Albany lO,N;Y. for information on the

trapping problem.

25) Read one of the following interesting books and tell your class mates

about it:
Pilgrims ofthe'Wild, by GreyOwl
The Men of the Last Frontier, by Grey Owl
Sajo and the Beaver People,by Grey Owl
Wild Animals I Have Known,
Lives of the Hunted,

There are people who behave and talk as though animals were unable
to feel pain, or to suffer emotionally (from terror,for example,
or from fear, or anxiety, or other psychological factors).

From your science work in physiology and biology, and from your
own observation as well, produce evidence that animals are capable

of suffering both physical pain and mental distress.

GIRL SCOUTS OF THE U.S.A. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
155 East AAth Street
New York 17, N. Y.

MUrray Hill 2-2505

A ten-day course on the care and use of large and small tracts of
land will be included for the first time this year in the curriculwm at
the Edith Macy Training School, the national Girl Scout adult education
center at Pleasantville, New York. The course will be held from.July 2A
to August A.

According to Miss Marie E. Gaudette of the national staff of the
Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., who is in charge of the course, the theory
of land management can be applied to backyard landscaping as well as to
larger stretches of land.

Designed primarily to help non-specialists to develOp Girl Scout camp—
ing sites, the land management course will demonstrate ways to use land
and at the same time preserve its natural resources. As part of the
course, field projects in land.management will be conducted at the Edith

Macy School.

Established in 1926, the Edith Macy School is the national adult

education center for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. Courses are held

at the school from June to September.

The Edith Macy Training School is more than a school or a summer camp—it is an experience in living. Unique in its
combination of setting, curricula, and training techniques, the adult leadership center is itself a leader in its ﬁeld.

Based on Edith Carpenter Macy’s dream for making Girl Scouting grow through competent leadership, the training
center was opened in 1926. Since that time, both Girl Scouting and Macy have grown, keeping pace with the newest
advances in group teaching, leadership, and dynamics. Macy has deﬁnitely become a place where “better leaders for better
Scouting” is a reality.

With an enrollment of women from all over America and the world bringing new life and new ideas, Macy presents a
program based on a deep knowledge of and the latest advances in the study of human relations. From its beginning, the
school has pioneered in all ﬁelds of knowledge and skills essential for those who would guide girls toward happier and
more useful lives. Leaders in the ﬁelds of education and group work have given the highest commendation to Macy’s
content, organization, and teaching methods.

Women who believe in the philosophy and aims of Girl Scouting can increase their usefulness to the girls they serve

by enrolling at Macy. The two-way relationship between staff and students, with both groups giving and receiving, is the

basis of all good Girl Scouting. While being trained, the students are simultaneously learning how to train others.
Courses cover instruction in all phases of Girl Scouting—from child psychology to world affairs, or from making
a block print to building an outdoor kitchen. Whether you are a committee member or camp director, there is a course

especially designed to lead you in new ways of Girl Scouting.

Humane education should.reooive the serious attention of the United Nations
for three major reasons.

1) Peace. The spirit of consideration and sympathy for other living beings
whether they be human or animal, of "Reverence for Life" as Dr. Albert Schweitzer,
winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has phrased it, is the basic human attitude
necessary for the establishment of a genuinely peaceful relationship among human
beings and nations throughout the world. This is the spirit which motivates and
guides humane education.

2) Sound Egonomy; Man is dependent to a large extent upon animals. The
important economic gains to be obtained through the kind and intelliﬁent care of
domestic animals have been repeatedly demonstrated. However, these economic
benefits are often ignored for lack of sufficient knowledge, and cruelty and waste
result. Humane education combines the dissemination of sound principles of animal
husbandry with the encouragement of individual sympathy of all animal owners and
caretakers for the animals in their charge. Likewise, in the important effort to
conserve the world's natural resources, including its wildlife, humane education
combines the strictly practical with the ethical. Because they serve human interests
the animals which human beings use or kill are entitled to the most humane treat-
ment possible in every instance. In a field such as the tranSportation and
slaughter of livestock, prevention of the bruising which results from beating,

 

L)

kicking, rushing, crowding, and other forms of cruel or careless treatment would
mean the saving of hundreds of millions of pounds of meat every year.

3) Advancement 23 Civilization. Educators consider the humane education of
children to be a most effective way to build and develop good character, to
encourage thoughtfulness and consideration for others and to create a sense of
responsibility especially toward the helpless. Humane education is in harmony
with all the great religions. It embraces a wide variety of subject matter and
teaching methods ranging from the most elementary teaching of kindness to little
children to a scholarly study of ethics. It owes its existence to Societies for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and.Animals, which sought a two-fold purpose
in encouraging it: to promote the welfare of children and animals; to advance
civilization through the refinement of human character. Dr. Albert Schweitzer
.expresses most clearly the potential advancement of civilization in the following
words.

 

 

Dr. Schweitzer points out that a man is ethical "when he devotes himself helpfully
to all life that is in need of help. Only the universal ethic of the feeling of
reSponsibility in an ever-widening sphere for all that lives ~ only that ethic

can be founded in thought. The ethic of the relation of man to man is not some-
thing apart by itself. It is only a particular relation which results from the
universal one. The ethic of heverence for Life, therefore, comprehends within
itself everything that Can be described as love, devotion, and sympathy, whether
in suffering, joy or effort. ..........A deepened, ethical will to progress which
springs from thought will lead us back, then, ut of uncivilization and its misery
to true civilization. Sooner or later there must dawn the true and final
Renaissance which will bring peace to the world."

THE AMERICAN HUMANE ASSOCIATION

What We Are

The Arne rican Humane Association was or-
ganized by the first national conference of hu-
mane societies, held in Cleveland in 1877. It
was evident, even at that early date, that only
through national organization could the local
societies and the thousands of isolated individ—
ual humane workers achieve national power a-
gainst cruelty.

At first the new Association operated al—
most exclusively as the means of organizing
annual conventions of humane workers. It was
soon evident that there was much more to be
done. How were local humane societies to deal
with cruel interstate tranSportation of animals ?
How could a local society for protection of chil-
dren benefit from the experiences of SPCC'S
elsewhere? How were new humane societies to
be organized and helped? The obvious answer
was a strong national organization.

The Association was formally chartered in
the District of Columbia in 1903. Headquarters
was permanently established in Albany, New
York, in 1905, moved to Denver in 1954.

Todayalmost everyhumane society in Amer—
ica that meets AHA standards of humane work is
a member of the Association. The affiliated so-r
cieties have more than a million members. In
addition, the Association invites all humanitar-
ians to direct membership in the Association.

The Association is governed by a Board of
Directors,_ elected by the Association's mem-
bership. Because the Association has strong
membership in every state and territory of the
United States and because the Board of Directors
includes representation of every major section
of the country, the Association is today, more
than ever before, truly the heart of the humane
movement.

of

Law and Your Dog

In most communities, dogs must be 1i-
censed. By all means buy your license regu-
larly and promptly. The money helps to main-
tain services that are of special benefit to dog
owners. Be sure that your dog wears the num-
bered tag that usually is issued with a license.
Many lost dogs could be restored to grieving
families if only that little tag were on the dog's
collar.

The law about "control" of dogs varies from
community to community. Learn what your 10-
cal law is. Your local humane society can 'tell
you the rules. In many communities any dog at
large, even if licensed, may be picked up by dog
wardens.

Your Humane Society

It is worth while for any animal owner to
know about his local humane organization. If
you have anyproblem that might involve suffer-
ing for your pet, your humane society will be
happy to offer advice and help.

Most humane societies operate animal shel-
ters, which provide temporary homes for ani-
mals that are unwanted or that have strayed and
got lost. All of these shelters offer kittens, cats,
and other animals for adoption by pe0ple who
will give the animals good homes.

Many humane societies also provide ambu-
lance service for ill and injured animals.

In addition, humane society experts investi-
gate reports of cruelty; they make regular -in-
spections of stockyards, poultry markets, and
slaughter-houses; they advise law-makers on
many kinds of legislation affecting animals and
animal owners; they conduct educational pro-
grams that teach kindness and compassion to
hundreds of thousands of children; they provide
euthanasia (painless death) for animals for which
that is the most merciful course.

All of this is important to you as an animal
owner . Learn the name and address of your local
humane organization and get acquainted with it.
If you do not find a humane society in your im-
mediate vicinity, ask the American Humane As-
sociation, 896 Pennsylvania Street, Denver,
Colorado for the name and address ofthe society
nearest you. Then, when you need advice or help
in any animal problem, you will know where to
turn for expert and friendly help.

A Manual for Teachers
Prepared by
ALBERT A. POLLARD, Director of Education
AMERICAN HUMANE EDUCATION SOCIETY
180 LONGWOOD AVENUE

BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS

 




WITH the arrival of spring

weather, interests of chil-
dren and teachers naturally turn
toward things happening out of
doors. Each day there is the
thrill of meeting old friends
among the bird arrivals from
the South. There is also the de-
light of making the acquaintance
of new animal friends. Children
are fascinated in observing
young tadpoles hatch from the
egg mass and in watching their
development. Yet, there are
some children who exhibit a cer-
tain fear and repugnance for
many animals such as snakes,
skunks, and hawks. Often there
is a desire to wantonly kill or
destroy these creatures. If we
can help children to be willing to
get all the facts about a creature
before passing judgment upon it,
many of the misconceptions and
superstitions which lead to its
mistreatment, suffering, and
death will change to desirable
attitudes.

This leaﬂet calls attention to
the many opportunities for pro-
viding children with happy expe-
riences, both for themselves and
the animal, whether it be a pet
or a creature of the wild. Such
experiences will develop initia-

tive and widen their interests,
and through understanding, atti-
tudes of thoughtfulness, self-
control, and kindness will be
strengthened.

Be Kind to Animals Week
serves to focus attention upon
proper handling, care, food, and
protection of pet animals. Its
further purpose is to reveal the
interrelationships between wild
life and plants and to point out
how wise use of our natural re-
sources contributes to human
welfare. Seasonal changes pro-
vide the opportunity to observe
the many kinds of living things
about us in fields and woods and
streams. Learning of their
varied needs and purposes for
living is a fascinating subject and
develops kindly feelings of won-
der and respect.

All teachers who wish to in-
troduce or increase activities of
this character in their curriculum
during the school year are in-
vited to consult with our teach-
ing staff.

The following ten projects
are suggestions for group activi-
ties during Be Kind to Animals
Week. Pupils may be elected or
may volunteer to head commit-
tees to carry out these projects.

Arrange an attractive bulle-
tin board with pictures of
animals.

Borrow from the public li-
brary or bring from home
good books of stories of the
animal world to be arranged
in a special bookcase or on a
ltibiaiy table, to be read by

he girls and boys. Suggest a
short oral or written book
report be made of each book

read by the children.

If possible, on different days
members of the class may
bring their own pet dog, cat,
hamster, turtle, or goldfish
and explain how they care
for it. This may lead to a
pet show some Saturday
morning.

Make a list with pictures of
those animals and their prod-
ucts on which we largely de-
pend for food, clothing. and
services. Make a similar list
of animals in other countries
of the world.

Write a letter to a local dairy
farmer and ask if your group
may visit to see the farm ani-
mals. En route observe and

Using plasticene, make a
farmyard scene of our com-
mon domestic farm animals.

Write invitations to your
parents, superintendents,
principals, and other rooms
in your building that they
may visit your room to see
your exhibits.

Plan a field trip to a nearby
pond or woodlot. See how
many different kinds of ani-
mals you can ﬁnd. Look for
insects, reptiles, amphibians,
birds, and mammals.

Draw pictures of the ani-
mals you have seen on your
ﬁeld trip. Be sure to depict
them in natural surround-
ings.

. Using a strong cardboard or

wooden box, construct a
three-dimensional panorama
of a particular woodland,
field, or farm scene.

Individual Projects

Make a poster with a printed
slogan urging kindness to
animals.

lWake some action sketches
of your own pet.

 




Build a bird house for your
yard, to be placed on a pole
» where it will get some shade.
\Vhy not make one for the
schoolyard, too?

Make a bird bath for your

own yard.

Write or tell a story of some
wild animal you may have
watched while you were at
camp or on a hike.

Procure a few frogs’ or toads’
eggs from a pond or stream,
placing them in an aquarium
ﬁlled with pond water. Watch
them develop through the
different stages. Finally, they
should be put back in their
natural habitat.

Search for a moth or butter-
ﬂy cocoon. Cut part of the
branch with the cocoon on it
and watch to see what
emerges. It should then be
allowed its freedom.

City Sanctuaries

Not too long ago when you drov,
away from the center of the city,
you passed woodlots, rolling meadcws,
fields filled with colorful wild
, flowers, and everywhere you noticed
k, that these open Spaces were filled
with birds°

Gradually people living in the city began to move out

from the center, into developments that were rapidly being
built on the outskirts. Bulldozers cleared acres of land, and
every last tree and shrub disappeared as the bulldozer's huge jaws
bit into the land. Not one tree was left standing, everything had
to go, to make a neat, tidy place for these new homes. Valuable
tOp soil, that had taken years to be established, was pushed off
to one Side, too.

Progress demands that highways must be built as well, and
hundreds of acres of woodland had to be sacrificed for this pur—
pose. in the meantime what has happened to the wildlife that made
their homes in these secluded places? Many of the birds have
moved back into the city. There are few city streets that are not
planted with trees. All kinds of trees-~tall graceful elms, that
invite orioles to hang their nest in the uppermost branches, and
thousands of maples with their horizontal branches that offer a
perfect nesting spot for robins, vireos and thrushes.

Then, too, there are Comparatively few city homes that are
not surrounded by a garden, and in these safe sanctuaries, hiding
among the lilacs, forsythias, and berry—bearing bushes, hundreds,
of birds that were only seen in the country have now found a safe
sanctuary.

Che morning in December, there were twenty—one White—Throated
Sparrows, with bright brown feathers and a white scarf tucked
under their chins, ten Juncos, one Chickadee and one Nuthatch in
my small city garden.

it is up to us to encourage them to stay with us, and your
winter feeding tray filled with bird seed will probably be the
best way of enticing the birds to remain.

The new year has begun, ' is hard to believe that four
months of our school year have already Sped by. During those four
months, a great many clubs were organized, and we hope before
another month passes that every school will be well represented in
the Audubon-Humane program.

If you have already subscribed, you will find the bulletin
sent from the National Audubon Society for December of special
interest. It suggests how to make bird feeding stations, and what
to do for our winter birds.

:t is most encouraging to learn that so many teachers and
pupils are anxious to participate in the Latham Foundation Inter—
national Poster Contest for 1958.

Mr. Ernest L. Stone and his associate, Miss Ellen Klingler,
have offered their services to help to make this year’s contest a
success. The New Haven schools have made an unusually fine record
in this particular contest, and we are out to better our previous
entries.

If you have had a dog for some time, it might be advisable for
you to study the new list of suggestions for the proper care of your
pet. These suggestions have been prepared by the Humane Commission
and distributed to those who adopt a dog from the Animal Shelter.

1. If your dog is 6 months old or older, he must be licensed

every year. The license must be renewed each June from
the Town Clerk's office.

2. Do you realize that licensing your dog does not permit him

to roam and be a nuisance. The state ddgﬁfawsuspecify that
owners of dogs roaming on the highway can be prosecuted.
BE SURE that your dog is under control at all times.
Feeding—-this will be taken care of in another bulletin.
Bedding——your dog‘s bed should be clean, dry and situated
away fron1<irafts.
Training—~don‘t confuse him with too many commands.
should be sufficient: SIT, STAY, DOWN, SOME and NO.
firm but patient with commands. Screaming or hitting
dog will only make him nervous and tend to confuse him.
When he reSponds, reward him with a tid—bit and he will
react more quickly the next time.

The other suggestions prepared by the Humane Commission will
appear in a later bulletin.

Wildlife and Abandoned
_ Domestic Creatures

By ROY a. SILVER
Special to The New York Times.
MASSAPEQUA, L. 1., June

> 7—Stray dogs, abandoned kit-

tens, injured Wildfowl and other
fauna have found a sanctuary
here through youngsters in the
Nassau COunty Animal Patrol.

The patrol consists of seven—
teen teen-agers—nine boys and
eight girls between the ages of

protection and preservation of
Wild and domestic animal life.
It was formed five years ago
by 16-year-old Paul Garrett, a
junior at Plain Edge High
SchooL

Paul has been the leader in
the expansion of the group

' from its original five “agents.”

He started the project after he
had seen a boy shooting birds
with an air rifle “and decided
to do something about it.”

Headquarters for the patrol,
consists of an upstairs office
and a basement animal room in
Paul’s home at 106 Toronto
Avenue here. The office con-
tains a police and fire alarm
radio receiving set, a telephone,
file cabinets and conservation
posters.

The animal room, which is
also an emergency room for

treatment of injured animals,

contains assorted cages, fish
tanks and a makeshift kennel.
The inhabitants now are two
pigeons, a hamster, a turtle and
six cats. The population fluc-
tuates daily.

Stray kittens and lame dogs
are frequently deposited on. the

'1 doorstep of the shelter by neigh-

borhood children. Residents who

have unwanted animals arrange
with the patrol to provide foster
hemes for their pets. Unfortu-
nately, there are few requests
for the animals, according to
Paul.

Emergency calls for treed or
injured animals are made in four
automobiles operated by those
who hold junior licenses, A police
radio can be adapted to any of
the cars. In addition, the mobile
patrol consists of three boats in

 

near-by waters, of which two

 

 

are equipped with ship-to-shore
telephones.

The “agents” are trained in
first aid procedure and obtain
free advice and treatment for
stricken animals and birds from
Dr. Kenneth J. Feldman, a Mas-
sapequa veterinary. The mem-
bers are schooled on state con~
servation laws and the State

Penal Code and work closely

with the local Conservation De-
partment agent.
Financing the project has

 

proved to be a burden for Paul,
who estimates that he has spent
between $1, 000 and $2, 000 in the
last five years. Members will
now pay 50 cents dues a month
for animal food, stamps, station-
ery, telephone call charges out
of the local zone area and other
expenses.

The youngsters, who meet
once a month during the winter
and more frequently in the sum-
mer, all have petsof their own,

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

As Mrs. Finnessey may have told you at the Oakland Office of the
Foundation, we are now in the middle of the current International
Poster Contest, which accounts for the fact our reply to your letter
of the 20th is somewhat tardy.

Unfortunately, the enclosures regarding the Zurich exhibit were not
in the envelope with your letter. We would appreciate it very much
if you would send them to us tOgether with additional information
about the World Federation for the Protection of Animals.

In order to send posters, it will also be necessary to have the name
of the addressee and the address where they are to be sent.

' We appreciate your interest in the work of the Foundation and look
forward to receiving your reply in the near future.

Very sincerely,

ITS EYES WERE VERY BLUE. Its head
was a bit unsteady. Its fur looked soft.
It was ﬁlled with the curiosity and——
shall we say, fearlessness of very young
things. This baby fox came to the top
of the fox hole and sniffed a human
beings shoe. The mother fox was nearly
beside herself with anxiety. She kept
jumping on and off the nearby stone
wall in an endeavor to attract attention
to herself. A beautiful animal, quick and
graceful.

Perhaps an opossum is neither quick
nor graceful but to those who under-
stand the wild, it is always a pleasure
to see. It is the only pouched animal
(marsupial) in the United States.

The kingdom of animals is a large
one. It includes foxes and earthworms,
opossums and spiders. In fact, anything
that is not a plant or mineral is an an-
imal. It may be the hugeness of the
animal kingdom that keeps some of us
from an understanding of it, that makes
some of us hold back from encompassing
it all. It is hard to believe that, with
few exceptions, all members of the ani-
mal kingdom have a place in, and a job
to do in this great thing called the bal-
ance of nature. The job that each thing
does, the contribution that each thing
has to make is little known compared
to what there is to know. For instance,
here are a few things: Where did a fox
learn to carry its young by the scruff of
the neck? How does a baby opossum get
into the pouch? How does an ant ﬁnd its

way back to its home? How does an
earthworm know how deep to dig? How
does a cicada know when it is time to
come out of the ground? Why do some
birds use horse hair and some use spider
webs in their nest building? What he-
comes of the antlers deer shed? We
need to know the answers to thousands
of questions, such as these before we
can know, with truth, the value of wild

animals in this whole area known as
conservation. We have thought a great
deal, though still not enough, about
trees, ﬂowers, waters and some forms of
animal life, such as birds. But what
about some of the others mentioned
above? Can we look upon the garter
snake with the same acceptance and
reverence for life that we have for the
robin?

There is much to be done with nature
besides learning the names of things. Of
far more interest is “watching living
things live.” It is the latter that is the
more interesting of the two. It is the
latter that heightens our imagination,
exercises our patience and does so much
to develop our powers of observation.

Join the crew of nature watchers! It
doesn’t cost a cent. You will say you
have never had such a good time in your
life!

Good luck! See you on a rotting log,
some day.

 

Miss Gaudette was for many years a member
of the staff of the Program Department of the
Girl Scouts of America and continues to act
as a nature consultant. She is known all over
the world as a nature authority and her inter-
national correspondence testiﬁes to the extent
of her friendship the world over with others
of kindred spirit who love nature as deeply
as does she.

Let9s Approach '

Nature Naturally! #

By Nancy Reading

IN SPITE OF THE PROFUSION of plants
and trees, animals and birls inhabiting
most of our communities, leaders often
ﬁnd it difficult to inspire girls really to
want to learn about their natural sur-
roundings. An unimaginative nature
study program can quickly dampen chil-
dren’s enthusiasm for the out-of-doors.

If, for instance, on a hot summer day,
an adult asks a group of children if they
want to learn the names of ten trees,
chances are the answer will be a hearty
“No!” at least from a large part of the
group. If, however, you were to ask the
same girls if they wanted to go wading,
you will probably get a more enthusi-
astic response. Here is your chance to
make use of their interest and direct it
to phases of nature study. While wading,
let them look for salamanders, frogs or
water plants. When one is found, point
out how it lives, Why it was found there
and how it is adapted to its environment.

This strategy, stated as a principle of
teaching nature, would be: Sllil teach~
ing to weather conditions and to
the mood of the group. On a “lazy”
day when there are clouds in the sky,
let your girls spend part of an afternoon
watching the clouds move and change
shape. Explain that clouds are merely
fog held up by air currents. Show them
different kinds of clouds and discuss
what each generally means. You might
include some information about how
weather is predicted from clouds and let
them try their hand at it.

On the other hand, it would not be
wise to have your girls sitting quietly
watching clouds, animals or birds when
they would prefer to be active. If they
are in an active mood, let them search
out various kinds of leaves, learn about
them and then make leaf prints of
them.

This leads to a second principle in
teaching nature study: 8V0id merely
assigning names to the plants and
animals being studied. Enthusiasm

22

can be sparked by including relevant
facts of particular interest to the girls.
F or example, you might say that White
pine trees are used for making the
wooden part of matches, the sort of
matches the group uses to light cook-
out ﬁres, or that pencils are made from
the wood of a red cedar tree. Tell them
how a grey squirrel buries his food and
later locates it by smell, or that one
reason birds can ﬂy and people can not
is that the former have hollow bones
which are lighter in proportion to their
size.

An experienced nature instructor once
taught a group of thirteen-year-olds the
simpliﬁed physiology and structure of
trees as well as the trees’ names while
the group sat on a log in the woods. The
youngsters showed interest and gained
much more than they would have if they
had set out to learn only the tree names.

A third principle is: use an imagina-
tive approach in presenting the
material. The approach a leader uses
can either develop or stiﬂe interest in
nature. I once watched an eleven-year-

old girl develop an active interest in her
surroundings when she was encouraged
to ﬁnd food for a harmless snake she
had caught. (Her leader was wise
enough to show only interest and no
fear even if she felt any!) Children will
have an interest in nature if it is not
spoiled by monotonous methods of
teaching.

One new approach to nature educa-
tion might be to watch the growth of a
plant or the progress of a ﬂower bud,
accompanied by an explanation of what
is happening inside the plant and why.
Explain the purposes of the color and
structure of ﬂowers and perhaps let the
campers dissect a blossom. One coun-
selor even had success in teaching algae
reproduction.

Basic to all these principles is the im-
portance of letting children take an
active part in the nature program. En-
courage them to start a rock and min-
eral collection, gathering the specimens
themselves and writing tags giving
names and interesting facts about them.

In using each of the principles men-
tioned here, also keep in mind that there
is no one way to interest all children in
nature. Keep the group’s program ﬂex-
ible and variable, even to the point of
sometimes permitting apparent lack of
organization on your part. If you con-
sider the interests and backgrounds of
the members of the group and adapt a
nature program to them, each girl will
ﬁnd nature study a rich and rewarding
experience.

a What could be more fun as a summer project than
to make a wildlife sanctuary? It doesn’t take much
knowledge to work one out on a small scale. Suppose,
for example, we take half an acre. This might be some-
one’s back yard, or a unit in camp, or a vacant lot in the
neighborhood, or on property belonging to the parents of
a girl in the troop.

Naturally, the troop—or some part thereof—will have
to come to an agreement as to the piece of land to use,
and get permission from the owner. Notice that we said
“the troop”! The girls should have the fun and experience
of making this selection, under your guidance. They
can do it if you have the faith.

The troop will want to know what plants and animals
already make their homes in or on this piece of land.
Don’t expect elephants and rare orchids! Earthworms
and dandelions have their work to do, too. (Earthworms
are animals. The world of nature is divided into but
three kingdoms—plant, animal, and mineral. YOu’re wel—
come!)

How do you go about finding out what lives on a
piece of land? Simple! just divide up the land into small
bits and give two or three girls their own piece to work
on. And we don’t kill or scare away the things we won’t
like, such as spiders, insects, harmless snakes. They all
have sanctuary! All we do, at this point, is put them on
a list. The girls can find the names of a great many
things themselves. They can find the help they need
from interested people or from books in their school
libraries or the public library. Don’t expect this all to
happen in a great rush. Have patience!

Now the troop considers what might live there—

The author, Marie E. Gaudette, 1's Nature Consultant, Program Depart-
ment.

JUNE 1958

Parents will enjoy the sanctuary as much as the girls

with a little encouragement. This does not mean up-
rooting the whole place, but it might mean clearing
a small part. Or partially clearing. It might mean plant-
ing a few trees or bushes or flowers. That would depend
upon what, that is native, the troop could get to live
there. Also, it will depend upon the part of the country
you are in.

Next comes the actual encouragement to wild things
to live in or visit your sanctuary. Such encouragement
might mean planting trees and flowers, pruning trees,
building and putting up birdhouses and feeding trays.
These things cannot be done in a hurry, and all take
thought because you are working with living things.

Surely the troop will mark the sanctuary in some way.
For a tiny sanctuary, the tops of cans, neatly painted, are
sufficient. And the girls will want some little signs
around that tell one or two interesting things about
some of the sanctuary dwellers.

Don’t worry about the time of finishing such a proj-
ect. It will never be finished! The girls will always find
things to do—and‘ to keep up—“unto the third and fourth
generations.”

A good deal of helpful free material is made aVailable
by the Girl Scouts of the USA. Send to Membership
Services for “Conservation Aids.” Our various mimeo-
graphed pamphlets give the addresses of organizations
and people that stand ready to help. If there is anything
that we in the Program Department can do—write to us,
will you? Or, have the troop scribe write to us.

Remember that this year we have a project to do an
“outdoor good turn.” We are also working hard with the
organization called Keep America Beautiful. Can you
think of a better way to keep our country beautiful than
to help keep places for her wildlife to live? THE END

APRIL, 1956

“Dominion over all the earth” has been

given into our human hands:

let us make sure that those hands are gentle

Is it spring where you are? For some
of you spring has come—perhaps gone.
For others the ground is still frozen, and
perhaps covered with snow. But there is
a time in the year, for all of us, when
spring is not only “in the air” but in our
hearts and souls. A time when “going
out” becomes a must. Walls press in on
us.

We say we need “the spring air,” but
what our beings long for is to have a part
in the coming again of another flowering
and borning year.

Spring is the time of little things. Some
of the seeds that fell last fall and winter
are breaking their jackets and sending out
roots and tiny leaves. We say “some” of
the seeds, because many will have fallen
where conditions are not right for them
and they may lie dormant for several
years until conditions are right—if ever.
Many will have been used as food by
birds and other animals. This is one of
nature’s magnificent provisions to carry
on a species and, at the same time, pro-
vide food for the growth of other things.

The mental picture of a person walking
out in the spring is‘ of a figure with arms
outstretched and head held high. But
some of us walk with shoulders hunched
and head bowed, watching the ground, so
as not to miss an inch—high hemlock tree
or a baby daisy plant with only four
small fragile leaves. We see God in the
majestic—the sweep of a sunset, the gray
stone mountain, but God is with that wee
daisy plant, too.

Spring is the time of baby mammals,
though some kinds are born when the
winter months are still with us. It is not
easy to raise a family in the wild. Every
bit of food has to be found; none can be
purchased in a shop. Dangers are every—
where—for the wild parents as well as
their young. Human beings can help to
make the spring less hazardous by driv-
ing with greater care. It is bad enough
to kill a male mammal, but the loss of
wild life is even worse when a nursing
mother is deprived of life. Who is going
to feed those small, helpless, warm things

The author, Marie E. Gaudette, is Girl Scout nature
adviser.

nestled in some well-hidden nest that one
can never seem to find? Who will hear
their whimperings?

Spring is the time when birds are in—
tent on mating, nest-building, and feeding
hungry mouths. Hundreds of thousands
of parent birds are killed by cars every
year—especially in the spring. One bird
darts across the road and we miss it, but
a knowledge of nature should tell us that,
in all probability, another is following.
Sometimes a parent bird is in pursuit of
an insect or snatching a dead one from
the roadway—a morsel for one of those
hungry mouths. Or it may be collecting a
bit of grass, a twig, a piece of string, to
be put in a nest. Or perhaps parent birds
have taken their babies out among the
bushes along the road. So intent are they
on their jobs as parents that they wait
just one second too long and are mashed
or broken on the highway. Most human
beings do not know how quickly or within
what footage a car can stop when going at
a given speed; we cannot expect our wild
things to have this knowledge.

Spring is the time when small things
exert all their smartness in self-preserva-
tion. This is an instinct that seems to be
at war, inside their tiny selves, with
curiosity, which is a characteristic of most
young animals. An inch-high hemlock
cannot move out of the way of a foot, nor
can a daisy plant with four leaves. But
baby mammals and birds can scamper or
stay very still until the foot has passed.
Sometimes they nestle in the warmth of
hands with a trust that is heart-breaking.
Sometimes they struggle to be free—
struggle for their lives with a bravery and
fearlessness that can be a lesson to human
life. ,
Go out in the spring! G0 quietly.
Watch God’s nature world repopulating
itself. Breathe in the freshness of this as
well as the air. Learn, as you can learn
nowhere else, the order of things. Let the
time of little things teach you that the
“full life” is a beautiful blending of free-
dom, responsibility, understanding of and
respect for the laws of nature, and a trust
in God. Nature can teach you this if you
will go quietly—and with seeing eyes.

whenever possible, requirements are built around girls' ability to plan
and organize and exercise leadership.

Every badge should include a self-evaluation in terms of the purpose of the
badge. (Girls of this age should be encouraged to learn to make judgments
on their proficiency, their effort, the success of their activities, the
artistic standards of their work, etc.)

Greater range and depth of knowledge and skills (and greater proficiency)
are expected at this age than at 9-10-11.

Average time for completion of badge is about 3 months of meeting time.
Some requirements are compulsory, most are optional.

All compulsory requirements can be done without the active participation

of the rest of the troop. Enough optional requirements to earn the badge
can be done without active participation of troopqmates. Some required
activities must have other people, e.g. in camping badges, but it should be
_possible for these to be family or friends. As at present, the desirability
of doing activities with the troop, ani the necessity of sharing learnings
with the troop, should be written in, but no girl should be denied the
opportunity to earn a badge because her troop-mates are not interested in
earning the badge.

Among optional requirements every badge has activities suitable for
group activity of a troop or petrol.

Humane Education

Should schools pay increased atunujon
to lunnane educaﬁon, udUi cnnphams on
teaching'chihjren to “be kind_to aninuﬂs?”

Troplevel representahves of the hurnane
movement, the National Education Assn, the
lJnued Shues Ofﬁce of.Educauon and pa-
rochial schools agree schools can and. should
recognize a responsibility in this field.

istziconlerence sponsored unntbrturthe
New Jersey branch of the Humane Society
of the United States (HSUS) and the New
Jersey State Teachers College of Union, NJ,
delegates chscussed lunv schools can incor-
porate such training into their curricula, and
lunv educators and hiunane socunies can co-
operate.

The conference askcd both the HSUS
and the Animal Welfare Institute to prepare
reading lists, motion pictures and other ma
terial for use in classrooms and in training
of teachers.

.Aknmzthese hnes,the lhnnane Socuuy
of Berks County has in recent years made
itself available for humane education to
county schools, civic organizations. Blue
Birds, Camp Fire Girls, Girl Scouts, etc.

Itsrnanagen Erneﬁ;J.EkudHace,has ex-
plained to boys and girls in local schools how
to care for and feed pets and, on occasunr
ilhunrated ins lectures “iUi prepared cohnf
slides.

lie also has shrnvn the shdes. projected
on a screen, to groups of school children who
tour the society’s headquarters at 1801 N.
11th St, as well as to Blue Birds, Camp Fire
Girls and Girl. Scouts.

1AM Hus urndd huhcauzthat hilunnane
educaﬁon the locallunnane sockﬁy has for
some time carried out the ideas advanced at
the New Jersey conference.

itt the conference,_Dr. Januw;’F. was
horter,1nxnessor of psychology at the lint
versity of Vermont, asserted that “the schools
should join with the home and with all other
influences in the life of a. child to cultivate
a capacity for empathy with all other living
things. A child or an adult unable to feel
love and synuxdhy for anhnab and chher
people is not mentally healthy.”

Dr. Robert Poppendieck. a specialist in
teacher education for the US. Office of Edu~
cation, said there must be a multiple ap-
proach to the task of humane education.

“The ‘teaching’ that we are agreed is
desirable,” he explained. “must be injected
into sociology, biology, literature, history and
other subjects of the basic curricula. What
we are naming as ‘humane education’ is not
to be thought of as a separate subject to be
squeezed into the curriculum like automobile
driver training or physical education. It is,
rather, a cultural and ethical idea that should
permeate our handling of every subject.”

Conference delegates agreed generally
that both public and private schools should
and can incorporate a new dimension of hu-
mane education into their program.

It may be expedient. therefore, to point
out that we can pick up a few points on hu-
mane education next Sunday at the open
house celebration of the Humane Society of
Berks County.

 




FACTUAL INFORMATION ON HUMANE EDUCATION
IN THE LATELY REVISED COURSE OF STUDY
FOR THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA

The emphatic clear cut declaration by Dr. Francis B. Haas,
Superintendent of Public Instruction for the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, constituted a pronouncement of the need for a new
era in practical education. To accomplish this purpose, we note
that education leaders were summoned to evaluate available assets
and re-write the course of study. In his preliminary instructions
Dr. Haas stresses urgent need of “PERSONALITY GROWTH FOR
THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD” and “A BETTER BEHAVIOR CON—
CEPT.” With rare vision he elaborates his pronouncement:

“A major responsibility of the school, in addition to individual
development, is to provide experiences that will produce better be-
havior and, at the same time, ﬁt the child for effective living in a
democratic social order.

“We need a curriculum organized on the basis of units of work
which are taken from the great areas of human experience and the
world of natural phenomena.”

On the merit of this encouragement, humane education in its
basic purpose is visualized in the following statement which stresses
the humane viewpoint for those responsible for its teaching and
character development:

“We hold as self evident the proposition that every child is
endowed with qualities to motivate desirable behavior toward the
life about him, to make effective his inherent desires for the well-
being of the creatures in his environment, and to help him choose
the ways of justice, mercy, truth and kindness.

“We recognize the importance of humane education in the school
program as it serves to direct the potential forces of mind and body
toward the realization of a better self.

“We accept the interpretation that the study of the humanities
affects thought and action to the improvement of the individual’s
behavior toward man and beast and to the improvement of character.

“We see in humane education the expression of the pattern for
ideal living and for the advancement of civilization,

. “We hold that by responsible activity and understanding in the
study of animal life, the individual may develop a noble philosophy
of life in which the world of creatures provides a laboratory for
classiﬁcation, identiﬁcation and practical service in the care, pro-
tection and conservation of all that is best in a living world.”

In an aggressive high school science course of study, Dr.
Frederick L. Pond, Supervising Curriculum Consultant for the
Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction, pioneered the
teaching of the humanities on the secondary school level. The ap—
peal for basic thinking in this project is noted as follows:

“The teaching of the HUMANITIES is far more intricate than
simple justice toward the creature world, or than the measure of pain
and suffering administered. Its major virtue is the impact on the
human heart that man may be more nearly what he ought to be.
Human excellence is on a higher level than the maxim — “CRIME
DOES NOT PAY.” It depends on the motivating force that may

[1]

 




 

halt the Crime of cruelty even though it costs something to be good.
In every contact with a living world, or in the functioning of a
democratic way of life, one must choose right above might, and
human excellence above the glitter of gold.

“In our limitations of perfection we may at times have to choose
between two evils, but the choice and the ideal must be the noblest
and the best within our command. We may teach a lesson on economy,
the production of marketable meat, fur, feather or hide, the trap line
or the hunt, or it may be a lesson on the grandeur of nature and
beauty, or the thrills of sportsmanship in a living world, but to at-
tain the humane goal we must seek the action of man at his best.
This “best” must ever be directed toward the nobility of THE GOOD
SAMARITAN. The teacher and the student who make this appli-
cation will attain the sum and substance of the humanities on the
level of higher education.

“CONSERVATION is intimately tied in with problems of hu—
manity. Any outstanding animal life problem may relate itself
to conﬂicts where material interests are likely to dominate over good
judgment. The teacher must, at all times, purpose to relate the basic
standards of humanity in dealing with conservation.”

The following outlines in the Pennsylvania High School Science
Course of Study constitute the frame work for the teaching of
humane education on the secondary school level:

HUMAN E EDUCATION FOR JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
Orientation by teacher and planning with pupils
Suggested activities: Pupil investigations and reports
1. A Study of Organizations

The studies under this topic should be considered for both
rural and urban schools. Part of these assignments may be chosen
for composition and theme work. They may also be coordinated
with biology, civics, nature study, and out-of—door projects. The

creature world and the out-of—doors become the laboratory for
ﬁrst—hand observation.

a. Note the scope of local organizations, their aims and purposes.

b. A representative of an organization may appear before the
group, or a student may be assigned to seek interviews and make
reports. If the organizatlon has equipment, activities, or ﬁeld

projects, individuals or groups may be assigned to report on
ﬁrst-hand observatlons.

HUMANE EDUCATION FOR SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLS
1. OVERVIEW 1w TEACHER AND PLANNING WITH PUPILS

 

A major study of conservation with an outlook to the
future of man’s well-being as well as that of the creature world
should become a motivating inﬂuence in cultivating the
democratic way of life.

2. LEARNING ACTIVITIES
a. Extinction

A study of the disappearance of species or forms of life
from the face of the earth is both enlightening and inspiring.
llumane considerations will take on a new lease of interest.
The high school student will proﬁt by special assignment for
available information through geological studies. Nature has
written these records with imprints of permanence and ac—
curacy more reliable than the more modern recording in books
and libraries. Such a study can be followed advantageously
by more modern analysis of trends of life showing gradual
elimination of species. The humane viewpoint is much en-
hanced when the depletion of creature life motivates resent—
ment. Such is the virtue of visualizing the destructive after-
math of SELFISH KILLING OR RECKLESS SPORTSMAN—
SllIl’. We note with serious concern the creatures in modern
times that have completely disappeared, and others whose
disappearance is threatened. A student can make an interest-
ing report to the class on such assignments as

The disappearance of the heath hen
The passenger pigeon

The threat of extinction of the bison, beaver, egret, bald
eagle and wild turkey (others may be added)

h. Hunting (urban and rural)

1. {egulating laws and license requirements

2. The need of restrictions on licenses covering education,
identiﬁcation, skill in usmg weapons, etc.
Guidance concerning true sportsmanship versus the
depravity of the klller
A studv of man’s interference with the balance of na—
ture and its relationship to licensed huntlng versus
promiscuous killIng

c. Fishing (urban and rural). Approach subject with appeal to humane
concern and conservation

1. Industrial

2. Destructive practices

3.1nterference with migratory habits
Construction of dams .
Hampering salmon spawning

[4]

 




 

Eels cut off from many of their small stream
habitats

4. Game ﬁsh, breeding and stocking

5. Open season and other game laws

d. Trapping
1. Steel trap cruelties

2. Steel trap regulations, Pennsylvania law
8. More humane leg-gripping traps and their merits.
4. Guillotine or killer traps; possible merit as compared

with ordinary steel traps

5. Deadfall trap —— pros and cons
The snare

6. Large or heavy traps for bear-like creatures and
legal limitation of the same; their danger for humans

7. Live traps, mostly box trap varieties
Freezing and other distress in box traps

8. Waste, ofttimes involving faulty catch in greater num-
bers than the number sought

Note: Trapping is rarely kind or humane, but sometimes it is
necessary. It is recognized as the outstanding cruelty in the
economic relationship between animal and man.

e. Predatory Animals

Some of the predatory creatures have value as fur bearers,
for food or for other possible assets, but are known as preda-
tory because they are destructive of other life of possible value.
Economically a predatory animal is a creature which destroys
more than it saves in human economy.

These creatures give us another slant on a higher level of
appreciation. Although they are destructive, they often func-
tion very effectively in that intricate law known as THE
BALANCE OF NATURE. They may not threaten extinction,
but instead may destroy the weakling of the species, thus
strengthening the race. Some predatory animals, such as

species of owls and hawks, are considered today of economic
value.

The teacher and the class may select for unit activity
certain creatures with habitat in the community, or some assets
or problems related to local animal life.

Foxes Owls
Snakes Ferrets
Hawks

f. Livestock Industry (rural and urban)

1. Methods of slaughter in the past (major cruelty in-
volved)




Methods of slaughter on farm — past and present
Common methods used today
Improved methods used today

More humane devices and methods in experimental
stage

6. Cash X Captive Bolt Pistol
7. Electric stunning

mews

g. Livestock Loss Prevention Activities (rural and urban)
1. Damaged meat — causes and losses
2. Transportation by train, truck, and on foot

11. Slaughter in Other Fields
1. Killing sports

2. Use of air riﬂes

3. Archery

4. Seal killing — methods and problems involved

5. Poison —— where used and where forbidden

6. Shock by dynamite as a means of killing ﬁsh, etc.,

and problems involved.

i. Cruel Sports (rural and urban) Differentiate between humane and
inhumane practices

1. Bull ﬁghts

2. Dog ﬁghts

8. Cock ﬁghts

4. Racing

:3. Live pigeon shoots
6. Use of weapons

j. History of the Humane Movement (rural and urban)

1. Societies fo1 the pievention of cruelty (aims, puiposes
and methods)

2. Rescue leagues, dog pounds, and societies for the
custody and care of pets, etc.

3. Humane education and specialized ﬁelds of service

k. Controversial Gloups (urban)

Somewl1e1e in the layout of the humanitaiian guidance,
theie should be included a deﬁnite statement to the effect
that —— NO LIVING ANIMAL SHALL BE USED IN ANY EX-
PERIMEN T OR DEMONSTRATION INVOLVING PAIN, DIS-
TRESS, OR SUFFERING. A law piohibits such practice in
the public schools of Pennsylvania. (Section 1514, Pennsyl-
vania School Laws, 1949).

Dear

I note with interest your local activities and presume that there is ready per-
sonnel and finances to "follow up" any humane program.that you.might undertake
in your local schools. This is very important.

In the attached outline of the "Humane Education in the Class Room" you will
note the pamphlets, leaflets, etc., mentioned are part of the outline instruc-
tion. These should be obtained from indicated places and thoroughly studied
and adapted for any local additions or subtractions. Ybur local Educational
Committee should then correlate this literature to the outline. (USe as much
of the outline as you need. It has been arranged so you can use or drop any
section and not destroy its continuityz) 'When your Educational Committee feels
confident that they could explain this outline of instructions tg the teachers
in eight one-hour sessions or as little as one-hour instruction course, then
the committee can approach your Superintendent of Schools or Education. Do
this in a manner as if you were asking for help to improve, as part of good
citizen training, this outline course; what would he add, etc. This gets his
interest, for he can hel , and tends away from."seeming" to push or censor

for not already having this character building addition in the classroom studies.

 

THE MAIN THOUGHT IS TO GET THE TEACHER WHO KNOWS THE TIME, PLACE AND THE CHILD TO USE THIS TRUE ANIMAL
INFORMATION IN ANY AND ALL OF HER SUBJECTS (AT ANY LEVEL) FOR DEVELOPING SUCH CHARACTER BUILDING TRAITS
AS PATIENCEs TOLERANCE, SEX-MANAGEMENT, FRIENOLINESS AND UNDERSTANDING. (THE OUTLINE SUGGESTS METHODS.
SEE PAGE 2.

THE TEACHER AND SO DOES THE SUPERINTENDENT KNOW VERY WELL THAT NO CHILD CAN BE KIND TO ANIMALS AND NOT
BE PERSONALLY BENEFITTED, AS WILL BE THE WHOLE COM'IUNITY. REPEATING FOR EMPHASIS “IN THIS WAY” THE
CHILD WILL BE BENEFITTED AS WILL THE COMMUNITY AND SQWILL THE ANIMAL.

YOU WILL NOTE THAT THE OUTLINE DOES NOT TRY TO INSTRUCT THE TEACHER IN CHILD PSYCHOLOGY, BUT IT GIVES
HER AUTHENTIC ANIMAL MATERIAL AND THE "NOR!" AND ”WHICH“ SHE CAN USE AS SHE SEES FIT AT HER M TEACHING
LEVEL.

IN MY COURSE I OFTEN ASK VETERINARIANS, LAWYERS AND A GENERAL "GOOD CITIZEN" OR CITY OFFICIAL TO GIVE
PARTS OF THE INSTRUCTIONS. IF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION WILL ALLOW YOU ONLY TWO ONE-HOUR OR ONE
TWO-HOUR SESSIONS, YOU HAVE TO GET IN WHAT INSTRUCTIONS YOU ARE ABLE.

THE ”FOLLOW-UP" BY VOUR EDUCATIONAL COMITTEE CROUP SHOULD BE EVERY 4-6 WEEKS WITH ANIMAL LIPE (COLUMBUS)
TOR I-Sao LEVELS; OUR DUMB ANIMALS (BOSTON) FOR 3-6TH LEVELS, AND THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIRN (ALBANY) FOR
JUNIOR AND SENIOR HICII SCHOOLS. THESE PAMPHLETS AND OTHERS THAT ARE AVAILABLE WILL HELP THE TEACHER AS
WILL POSTERS AND OTHER LITERATURE, AS SUCCESTED IN THE OUTLINE. THIS "FOLLOd-UP" WITH MATERIALS Is NECES-
SARY FOR SUCCESS AND IS SUPPLIED BY THE LOCAL HUMANE SOCIETY.

THE SUPERINTENDENT CAN SELECT CERTAIN TEACHERS TO TAKE THE HUMANE COURSE, OR USE HIS TEACHER SUPERVISORS,
OR CAN APPOINT ONE TEACHER FROM EACH SCHOOL, OR CAN CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS WHO TAKE THE COURSE WITH HIS
KNOWLEDGE. THEREFORE THIS INSTRUCTION COURSE TO THE TEACHERS IS MOST IMPORTANT AND SHOULD BE UNDERTAKEN
ONLY BY ONE WHO HAS STUDIEO THE OUTLINE VERY CLOSELY.

THE COURSE IS SUPPLEMENTED BY A KIT CGITAINING ALL POSSIBLE PAMPHLETS, LEAFLETS, ETC., INCLUDING A W"
OF THE HUMANE COURSE OUTLINE TO EACH TEACHER. THIS IS FOR FUTURE USE AND REFERENCE. (NOTE THE OUTLINE
HAS BEEN SO ARRANGED THAT STATEVENTS ARE MADE AND QUALIFICATIONS FOLLOJ.) THE TEACHER IS REQUESTED TO
MAKE SUCH NOTATIONS ON OUTLINE MARGIN AS SHE FEELS NECESSARY FOR HER QIIN PERSONAL CLASSROOM PROBLEMS.

A CERTIFICATE OF ATTENDANCE, AS IS ATTACHED, ADDS TO THE INTEREST OF THE TEACHER AND WILL BE SUPPLIED BY
THE LA. SPCA IF YOUR SOCIETY SO WISHES.

THIS NEW METHOD OF APPROACH IS POSITIVE, AUTHENTIC, AND THE OIILO IS APPROACHED BY A TRAINED TEACHER AT THE
TIME, LEVEL AND WITH AUTHENTIC AN‘IIMAL STORIES, WHEN THE CHILD WILL GET THE MOST FROM THIS CHARACTER BUILD-
ING PROGRAM. THE OLD METHOD DY LAYMEN WAS SPASI'DDIC, DISRUPTED THE TEACHER'S CLASSROOM PROGRAM AND WAS
OFTEN OVER OR UNDER THE LEVEL OF THE CHILD WITH ONLY HALF TRUE ANIMAL STORIES.

THE COST OF THE ENTIRE COURSE WILL DEPEND NATURALLY ON THE NUMBER OF TEACHERS TAKING THE COURSE, BUT I
HAVE FOUND THAT 32.00 IS AMPLE FOR THE INSTRUCTION KIT AND 88°00 PER YEAR PER TEACHER FOR 'FOLLOW~UP“.
THIS SHWS THAT FOR EACH TEACHER FOR THE FULL INSTRUCTION INCLUDING ONE YEAR OF ”FOLLOW-UP" LITERATURE,
THE COST WILL BE ABOUT 95.00.

IT Is EXTREMELY HARD To GIVE VOU ALL INSTRUCTION NEEDS FOR THIS COURSE. BUT I'LL BE VERY GLAD T0 PER-
SONALLY ANSWER POINTS OF INTEREST To YOU THAT I HAVE NESLECTED TO DOVER. THANKS FOR YOUR INQUIRY. I
EIRHLY BELIEVE FROM MY EXPERIENCE, THAT WITH A GOOD NUNANE EDUCATIONAL COURSE OF INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR
ISCHOOL, VOU HILL PROMOTE A PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE FOR YOUR HUMANE SOCIETY FROM WHICH NILL CONE DEMAND FOR
IOTIIER PROGRAI’S AND SERVICES.

XIII. Wildlife (Special qualified guest)

A. Relationship of animals and birds to plants and land
1. Animals
a. Habitats — varying from one species to another
1. tangles and briars for rabbits
2. marshes for muskrats
3. ponds for beavers
h. flat grass country for gophers
5. brush and hills fer’deer
6. running streams for otter and mink
Food
1. Grass plants for woodchucks
2. Twigs and grass for deer
3. Fish and smaller animals for mink and otter
h. Bark and leaves for beaver
5. Seeds, nuts and berries for squirrels and chipmunk
Importance to man i '
1. Some animals consume huge quantities of harmful insects
and animals each year - owls, skunks, warblers, stem
2. Some are necessary to keep the forests going - squirrels,
' chipmunks
3. Beavers have reclaimed thousands of acres of land
~ h. For their esthetic value - beauty of nature, songs of birds,
grace of movement
Birds
a. Habitats
1. Brush - hedgerows, pheasants, song birds
2. Cliffs - eagles, hawks
3. Large or tall trees — hawks, owls, crows
h. Buildings - night hawks, pigeons
Food
1. Hawks and owls - rats, mice, rabbits, very few or occasional
hen
2. Song birs - weed seeds and insects J!
3. Buzzards — carrion,Vstreet cleaners of old '
Importance to man
1. Tons of weed seeds consumed
2. Rats and mice by the thousands consumed
3. Aid in scattering seeds of trees and helpful plants
h. Farmers could hardly grow any creps if insects eaten by
birds were left
B. Impact of man on wildlife
1. Indian days
More forest - many more animals and birds who needed forest - fisher,
marten, beaver, woodpeckers
2. Colonial days
Results - tremendous amount of traffic in furs - pOpulation of wild~
life were somewhat reduced - forest cover cut. Some Species
entirely removed from some areas

3. Period of 1800's
Prairie plowed - wanton destruction of land and animals - passenger
pigeon exterminated, buffalo herds almost entirely
killed off

h. 1900 on

Began to be aware of necessity to conserve soil and animals on it.

Dust bowl, floods, restocking of trees and animals ~ game laws to

regulate the "take" of'animals - began scientific studies of life

histories to be better able to understand needs and furnish them for
greater animal pOpulation.

5. Some Present Day Practices that we need to correct
10 trapping
2. coon-on-the-log contests
3. highway kills
b. roadside zoos
5. bad hunting practices

What "Wildlife Management" means to different peeple

1. Some hunters and trappers
How to best promote large animal populations fer hunting purposes
regardless of needs of the land

2. Nature Students and Conservationists
Interest comes from natural interest in animals and beauty. .A
great deal of knowledge about relationships between different
species and their environment has come from peeple who have
studied "on their own". This group, in the main, likes to see
as little interference from man as possible in wild places.

3. Professional Conservationists of Government Agencies
Varies from state to state depending on what group has most in-
fluence. Some exist only to raise cr0ps of animals for hunting.
Others to satisfy all groups - still others to try and determine

While many important serv-
ices of The American Humane
Association are directed toward
acts of cruelty as they occur,
an equally important function
of the AHA is the prevention of
cruelty before it occurs.

The author of this article,
Nell G. F ahrion, has taught
educational psychology at the
University of Colorado for
eight years. She believes that
if the question of “how feel-
ings of kindness and sympathy
are acquired” is answered, the
AHA will be better able to di-
rect humane education in the
home and in the school.

W

IN A STUDY OF CHILDREN’S attitudes
some years ago, pre-schoolers were
shown a small, living snake and
asked if they would like to cut it up.

The youngsters gave joyful assent.

But when they were reminded by
the investigator that this would hurt
the snake, most of them reversed
their responses.

There is reason to doubt that this
willingness to cut up the snake rep-
resented a tendency to cruelty in the
children. And there is likewise reason
to doubt that their reversals reflected
true feelings of kindness and sym-
pathy. The more likely assumption
is that their ﬁrst assent sprang from
curiosity rather than cruelty, and
that the reversals in attitude repre-
sented a desire for adult approval
rather than true feelings of kindness
and sympathy.

Children are good imitators of
attitudes. They soon learn to follow
cues furnished by adults. By the
time they are four or ﬁve, most chil-
dren are familiar with the verbal
concept of kindness and attach it
appropriately to actions in stories
or in real life situations.

But when and how do positive
social feelings—kindness, pity, sym-
pathy, unselﬁsh love—develop?

In the behavioral sciences, the
matter is treated casually, if at all.
Go to the shelves of psychology texts
in any library and leaf through each
in turn. In all probability, there will
be no reference to the concepts of
kindness and humanitarianism, but
many to the acquisition of hostilities
and fears.

THE NATIONAL HUMANE REVIEW—MAY-JUNE.

Humanitariamsm:

A BaSic Research Problem

By NELL G. FAHRION

Almost everyone who has had a
course in elementary psychology
remembers the story of little Albert,
who was conditioned to fear a white
rat through repeated exposures to it
in the company of a sudden, loud
sound. Eventually the startle reﬂex
and its unpleasant physiological con-
sequences became associated with
the rat. The child’s fear response in
the presence of the little animal
became ﬁxed.

Numerous such studies concerned
with the acquisition of fears have
been reported. But when the subject
of love is treated in the texts, it is
likely to be in terms of sex attraction
or of neurotic ﬁxation. Apparently
that aspect of love which we see in
humanitarianism is considered too
broad and philosophical for careful
investigation.

This neglect is a serious matter. It
suggests that cultivation of the posi-
tive social feelings must remain a
haphazard process, left more or less
to chance encounters and admoni-
tions.

Since the objective evidence is so
meager in this ﬁeld of inquiry, a pre—
liminary approach might be to ask
adults to introspect and report their
own experiences in acquiring feel-
ings of kindness; and this approach
has been employed by the writer in a
survey carried out during the past
two years at the University of Colo-
rado’s Extension Center. Question—
naires in the form of check lists have
been employed to some extent, but
personal experience essays combined

with interviews have proved the
greatest source of insight.

When individuals are asked di—
rectly, “How do you think people-
acquire feelings of kindness?” the-
most frequent response is, “Why,
most people just naturally are kind.
Kindness is inborn.”

But then the individual is likely
to add thoughtfully, “In my own
case, though, I guess I didn’t know
the true meaning of kindness until
the summer I was eleven. . . And
he proceeds to relate some critical
incident.

The statements following are ex—
cerpts from personal essays written
by college students who participated
in the survey mentioned. They
clearly exemplify what we mean by
a “critical incident.”

“Our farm neighbors left their
poor old dog to starve when they
moved away, and one night he
came over to our place and killed a
chicken. My father would have used
a rifle on him, but I thought maybe
if I gave him half my lunch every
day he wouldn’t have to kill chick-
ens. At ﬁrst, it was just a kid’s
curiosity about cause and effect that
motivated me, but after I started to
feed him, something happened. I
had never felt so good before.”

“I had pulled the wings off flies
and snipped the legs off several grass-
hoppers to make patients for my play
hospital. The next morning all my
patients were dead. I suddenly real-
ized that I couldn’t have done any-
thing for them even if they’d lived

The American Humane Association does not approve,
any exploitation of animals. AHA, through its Holly-
wood Ofﬁce, has supervised animal action under the
motion picture code since 1940. In 1958, AHA was
named ofﬁcial animal consultant by the three television
networks and now supervises virtually all TV animal
action.

In 1959, the Rodeo Cowboys’ Association, Inc. asked
AHA to appraise, augment and codify regulations for
the protection of rodeo animals. AHA compiled a set
of 16 standards: based on the practical experience of
major humane societies long active in the supervision
of some R.C.A. rodeos; encompassing existing R.C.A.
rules and adding new features.

The 16 rules, adopted by R.C.A.’s board of directors
and approved for publication in the ofﬁcial rule book,
for the ﬁrst time provide a uniform set of standards for
the practical supervision of rodeos.

While AHA does not approve animal exploitation,
this uniform nation-wide code for rodeo livestock han-
dling does mark major progress toward reducing—and
eventually eliminating—rodeo animal abuses.

The Rodeo Cowboys’ Association is a non-profit
organization of professional rodeo contestants, formed
for the betterment of the sport. Lex Connelly is secre—
tary-treasurer of R.C.A. The following article is based
on a speech delivered by Connelly to delegates at the
83rd annual convention of The American Humane

Association.

By LEX CONN ELLY

It was imminently proper and logical that R.C.A.
and AHA should come together on the subject of
humane treatment of animals. From a purely practical
viewpoint, one ﬁeld could not long ignore the other:
the objectives we both pursue would eventually bring
us together. And for our part, we think it much better
to meet in agreement on our common objectives than to
postpone these meetings until we are forced to seek
some ground for agreement.

The American Humane Association standard of hu-
mane treatment of livestock and the American cowboy’s
inherent attitude toward the animals he works with are
not really so dissimilar. Rodeo is the cowboy’s sport.
Rodeo exists because the cowboy, more than any other
horse trainer in history who worked with so much wild
stock, gave the horse an even break.

It is well recorded in history that horses powered
man’s conquest of the wilderness that was the West.
A century ago horses were needed by the hundreds of
thousands. They were available in great supply, on the
high ranges of the west—wild mustangs that were
spirited descendants of the hot-blooded steeds of
invading Spaniards. The cowboys who caught the
broncs and tamed them would not resort to the cruelty
of the Spaniard or the starvation techniques of the
Indian.

The cowboy simply cinched his saddle on a wild
horse and climbed aboard. The battle was on—and it
was a fair ﬁght. The horse, in the full strength of his
maturity, was free to try every tactic he knew. The man
emerged from the struggle as master only after he had
proved his right to be master by his own courage and
determination.

thinking that the poor old cat would
have suffered as much as my dog
did. I’ve never hit an animal since.”

Several findings of interest have
emerged from the survey as a whole:

fun” or to prove their “nerve” to their
peers. The average age for the
height of such activities has not yet
been established; but it appears in
many cases, the behavior has per-
sisted through early adolescence.

(2) Of those admitting to acts of
cruelty, by far the largest percentage
are males.

(3) In the case of both male and
female students, identiﬁcation with
an adult, usually a parent, seems to
have been of considerable impor-
tance in the development of the hu-
mane attitude—the performance of
the adult being more influential in
this respect than his verbal admoni—
tions.

(4) Beyond the experience of
identification and empathy, some
particular incident appears to have
been crucial in the emotional devel-

opment of many of the boys and
girls. in some instances, the in-
dividual was the recipient of an act
of unusual kindness; in others, some
act of cruelty or kindness on his own
part brought consequences of sud-
den insight and a welling up of pity
and remorse for past thoughtlessness,
together with a resolve to be kinder
in the future. These are the “critical
incidents” referred to.

The students queried often express
discomfort in the recall of their ex—
periences; and perhaps it is because
it is so painful to relive one’s own
early indifference to cruelty (or
actual enjoyment of cruelty) that
research workers have failed to come
to grips with this phase of emotional
learning.

Of course, the fact that our knowl—
edge is still quite incomplete con-
cerning the “laws” of acquiring feel-
ings of sympathy and kindness need
not deter our continued intuitive and
experience-based procedures in edu—
cation. Those men and women de—
voting their time to humane educa-
tion under the auspices of The
American Humane Association are
doing an outstanding job. However,
if basic research can add to our
understanding of the complex proc—
ess of emotional learning, we may be
better able to advise parents how to
employ the child’s natural tendency
to identify with others and how to
make deliberate use of critical inci-
dents in structuring feelings along
socially healthful lines.

Our W-K High Altitude Chamber

more than three years and has
proved most satisfactory. We be-
lieve it is the very best method of

Daily Experiences
in the Third Grade Which

Contribute to Humane Education

By EDITH M. HOLWAY

Fan/raga! Model School
aﬂiliated will)
The Teachers College of the City of Boston

SMALL boy came running into the house. His eyes
A shone with eagerness and joy as he exclaimed,
“There’s a toad in our ﬂower garden. That’s good,

isn’t it?” Then he told what he had learned at school about
toads and their great value to the farmer and the ﬂower
lover. The same boy and his mother went to call on Uncle
Walter who lived on the old family farm. They found
that they could not go to the orchard through the grape
arbor as usual. The following sign had been posted at the

entrance:
PLEASE KEEP OUT
MRS. ROBIN ON NEST
IN ARBOR

Mrs. Robin may have been wiser than she knew when
she selected the grape arbor for nesting. These are two
excellent examples of humane education experiences for
any small boy. He learns in a very natural way to have
a real respect for all living creatures—a deep and pro-
found respect for every living thing, the underlying prin—
ciple of humane education.

The building of humane understandings, appreciations
and attitudes so that they will activate conduct is a large
and very important part of child development. The pur-
pose of this article is to show how the various subjects in
the third grade curriculum, nature study, reading, litera-
ture, oral and written English, arithmetic, etc., contribute
to these humane education objectives.

An exhibition hive of bees was placed in the third grade
of the Farragut Model School. The children were very
much excited and asked many questions showing their
interest and desire to learn. The teacher had only a gen-
eral knowledge of bees and their importance in the sci-
entiﬁc world, so the class and the teacher began to study
together, making daily observations, consulting reference
books and discussing many points of interest with the di-
rector of the school who is an authority on the nature and
nurture of bees. Asking and answering intelligent ques-
tions, taking part in talks and discussions and learning
how to use books to obtain information complemented
their ﬁrst-hand or real experiences. With increased under-
standing came deeper appreciation and eagerness to share

their information, ﬁrst—hand or vicarious, with other classes
and visitors. Such a genuine interest persists and will
attach itself to other phases of life in the natural world.
The class found several interesting poems and verses about
bees for their poetry books. The favorite was THE BEES
by Lola Ridge.

Soon after school began in September the children and
the teacher went for walks in the F enway. They watched
the squirrels, fed the ducks, looked for fall birds, enjoyed
the autumn foliage, made drawings in their sketch books
and discovered many interesting things in the park that
they had never noticed before.

At the Children’s Museum the class saw a ﬁlm depicting
the preparation of birds and animals for winter. The
woodchuck’s home with its tunnel made a great impres-
sion. The next day their reading lesson was “The Four
Baby Woodchucks.” The following reading assignments
by the writer illustrate her two-fold objective: teaching
children how to read and using every opportunity for
recognition of humane ways of living.

IV. Choose a part you would like to read aloud to the

other class

The teachers of today owe a debt of gratitude to the
authors of children’s books. There is a vast amount of
excellent material which the teacher can use in planning
the work in humane education.

The study of people of other lands is a part of the
geography work in this grade. The delightful customs of
the Swedish people, the people of Norway, Denmark and
other countries with, their very special feasts for the birds
and animals at Christmas, are ﬁne examples of kindness
to animals. How interested the children were to read that
in France it is bad luck for a year if one speaks harshly
to an animal!

The question of what is being done for animals and
birds in this country brought out much interesting infor—
mation about the work of the United States Government,
about sanctuaries and national parks and about the work
of special agencies for the care and protection of birds
and animals. In addition to the practical information
which the children obtained from such extensive and care-
fully planned reading, a real respect for birds and animals
was initiated and fostered.

When the Dog Show was held in Boston the children
began to bring in clippings from the newspaper for the
Bulletin Board. Those who attended the show gave re-
ports of what they saw. They read about David whose
father took him to a Kennel Club Show to help decide
the kind of a dog he would choose for his birthday present.

The class decided to make a special study of dogs.
Children who owned dogs were asked to talk about their
pets, describe their appearance and their characteristics
and tell interesting anecdotes about them. These stories
were put in a book called Farragut Animal Tales.

Vocabulary building is an important part of the work
in English. Vocabulary lists were made which helped the
children tell better stories.

Many pictures of animals and children are to be found
in magazines and papers. They are very suggestive for
oral composition. The children learned that a good story
must have a good beginning sentence. They have been
taught that “I have a dog” or “My dog’s name is Spot”
are poor beginning sentences, whereas in the beginning
sentence, “My dog made us all laugh today,” something
happens and a real story is begun.

Beginning sentences made by different children about
the same picture:

1. Sport is a new dog that Mrs. Hill brought home one
night. (William) _ '

2. It is winter and the birds are hungry. (Barbara)

3. One day Mrs. Hill forgot to feed the birds. (Marie)

4. Mrs. Hill and Sport are the chickadees’ friends.
(Helen)

5. Sport said, “I’d like to'chase those birds.” (Joseph)

Two of the beginning sentences were chosen and the
compositions completed.

1. “One day Mrs. Hill forgot to feed the birds. Sport

knew they were hungry. He pulled and pulled at Mrs.
Hill’s dress. Then she remembered. Sport was a proud
dog all day long.”

2. “Sport said, ‘I’d like to chase those birds.’ He ran
out of the house and jumped up toward the feeding sta-
tion. Away ﬂew the chickadees. Mrs. Hill did not like
that. Now Sport has to stay in the house until the feed—
ing time is over.”

As the work progressed it was found that many prob-
lems needed discussion. Prominent among these were the
food, care and protection of animals, at home, on the
farms, in the woods and ﬁelds and at the zoo. A series of
talks were planned and the following announcement posted
on the Bulletin Board.

Talks About Dogs

In the third grade in the Farragut School the children
write diaries and it is interesting to note how often they
write about animals and birds.

Harriet’s Diary
April 22, 1940

I called Monday my kitten day. While I was roller
skating I looked over a fence and saw a mother cat and
her kittens. When I went to my uncle’s store his cat had
four little kittens. He was going to give us one, but mother
said one cat around the house was enough.

The last sentence in Harriet’s diary started a very in-
teresting discussion about baby kittens and the problem
of too many kittens.

Such problems in arithmetic as the following become
vital to the 'children when given in connection with chil-
dren’s experiences.

John bought a leash and a new collar for his dog. The
leash was $.89 and the collar was $1.25. How much did
he pay for both? Wouldn’t you like to meet John and his
dog in the Fenway?

Some First Grade Experiences

in
Humane Education

By MARY o. MALONEY

Farragut Model School
aﬁlz'zzz‘eo’ with
The Tear/yer; College of the City of Boston

UMANE EDUCATION! What does it mean? Animal
interests and welfare? No, not alone, for this would
be interpretation in a limited and narrow sense. The

spirit of humane education is far wider in scope and richer

in content in its fundamental meaning of character develop-
ment. It is with this broad and most fundamental interpre-

i tation in mind that the following classroom experiences are
" presented. A study of history reveals that the humane spirit is
f not something new, but that it has existed from earliest times
. in; the art, literature, and religion of mankind.
Through the survival of this spirit the humane movement
‘ has become deﬁnitely organized, and the fostering of humane
attitudes and ideals in the development of our children is a
major educational objective in all humanitarian work. To
this setting comes the young child. What does he contribute
fo‘ihe situation? His innate interest in animals—a most vital
eletnent. This, then, is the point of contact upon which the
teacher and humane worker should build

To what extent does the school curriculum meet this innate
interest of the young child? Adequately, for the objectives of
the curriculum are in accordance with children’s interests and
provide abundant opportunities in the ﬁeld of humane edu-
cation; hence the time factor is not a deterrent in the well-
integrated program. A survey of literature shows that it is
replete with poems and stories suited to the animal interest of
early childhood. Dearly beloved in the literary ﬁeld are the
Mother Goose rhymes, folk tales, nature poems, and realistic
animal stories. Today valuable suggestive bibliographies are
to be found 1n all good courses of study.

The facts already conceded are: the spirit of humane edu-
cation fis character development, the child has a natural interest
in animals, the curriculum recognizes this interest, and the ﬁeld
of literature is replete with an abundance of material suited
to the interest of the child in animals.

With the above fundamental facts well in mind, the fol-
lowing unit has been developed as a beginning unit of learn-
ing in humane education.

Pets
Each school year ﬁnds a group of little children in Grade I
of widely differing personalities. Some children have had va-
ried experiences, are social and eager to talk and investigate;

others, whatever their experiences have or have not been, are
extremely shy and difﬁdent. Adjustment, therefore, is a major
beginning problem. Every child may become a contributory
factor in the life of the group if there is a point of individual
as well as group interest. Classifying the animal interest of
the young child on the basis of frequency of contact with ani-
mals in his own environment and in his reading experiences—
those in the ﬁeld of pet and farm animals—we ﬁnd that the
subject of ”Pets” provides the best contact between the fa-
miliar home and the new and unfamiliar school environment.
With the child’s natural interest as a focal point the following
objectives give direction to the development of this unit:

To create a desire to share experiences about pets.

To enlarge the understanding of pets and their needs.

To build an appreciation of the care and protection of pets.

To develop habits of kindness to pets, the child’s own and
those belonging to others.

To promote these objectives a wide and varied program of
plans and activities was developed. In response to simple,
direct questioning on the part of the teacher, the children were
stimulated to tell something interesting about their pets. Po-
ems, songs, pictures, and stories served as stimuli for further
conversation. Snapshots of various pets were oﬁ‘ered as tangible
evidence of the reality and the place that the animals held in
the lives of their owners.

Organization soon became a necessity. The more familiar
pets were selected and a picture chart made of these animals.
Miniature picture charts were hectographed and each child
had his own. Beneath the pictures the names—a cat, a dOO.
a rabbit, a pony, a goldﬁsh, and a bird—were printed. These
names became part of an initial reading vocabulary.

Interesting stories about pets, selected for class appeal and
for vocabulary, were recorded on the blackboard and served as
rote reading situations. Our ﬁrst story follows:

The story tells in a direct, interesting and vivid manner of
the pet’s need for water. The carry-over from such a record
is endless. Discussion followed and a general rule was de-
veloped from the speciﬁc incident: Keep a pan of clean water
for your pet. Appreciation of the care of pets followed this
incident. One or two simple facts were presented under food,
beds, bathing and handling of pets.

Habits of animals, movement and the sounds they make
appeal to the young child. A record of this type of experience
follows:

Harriet’r Cat

Harriet bar a pet cat.

He bar a funny name.

IV bat i: bis name? (Felix)
Tbir cat liber to play.

He liber t0 MHZ anal jump.
He liber nzilb

”Mew, mew!” ray; tbe cat.
Tbir mean; ”Tbanb you!”

Every child has experienced the above situation. The facts
are common to all cats and every child has owned, lived near
or seen a cat. Since each child felt a share in Harriet’s story
it was recorded as a permanent one.

Classroom activities are very important in units of humane
education. The ”doing” is vital to the little child for this is
how he learns. To meet this need an aquarium was set up.
The children had an opportunity to observe the tank empty,
to set the plants in the sand, to ﬁll the aquarium with water,
and to wait for the plants to take hold before animal life was
added. Finally the day came when the goldﬁsh, snails and a
polliwog completed our balanced aquarium. Habits of life
were observed and knowledge of feeding was acquired by
actual contact. The children, in caring for the aquarium,
learned a very fundamental principle in the care of all pets.
This was ”cruelty in kindness.” Too much kindness resulted

 

in an overdose of food and an unbalanced or ”sick” aquarium.
Balance was restored by syphoning and a salt bath for the
goldﬁsh. Children were helped to apply this principle of
feeding, stress being placed on the ”cruelty in kindness” of
overfeeding and handling of animals.

Related outcomes of the pet unit were checked in terms of
the objectives set up. It will be remembered that the unit was
developed as a beginning one. In Grade One teaching the
young child to read is a major objective. The initial reading
experience should be based on the child’s interests and the
subject of pets did and always will fulﬁll this requirement. An
enriched oral vocabulary from personal and class experience
was presented. A reading vocabulary was selected as an out-
growth of the oral one.

Rote reading was built cooperatively by the teacher and the
children. These pet stories were charted for drill and reference
work. The stories belonged to the children and this ownership
aroused a desire to learn to read. Such an urge is a powerful
force which leads to accomplishment. A concrete result of our
unit is the pre-primer. Each child has his own made up of
the basic vocabulary chart, stories about pets, check-up tests
and seat work sheets. The reading, at the time of the unit,
was rote.

Poetry and story appreciation, as phases of literature, were
an important part of the unit. The enriched background of
experience was the basis of many'related outcomes in the ﬁeld
of humane education. With the development of the under-
standing and appreciation of the care of pets in the classroom,
the desire to apply such learnings would be natural for the
young child and awaits only the occasion. The nurture and
extension of these beginnings should lead to the desire to be
kind not only to the pets in the home and school, but to all
animals.

What Humane Education is and should do for the child

Humane Education is the proper training of children that they shall
be enabled to enjoy nature, respect its laws, and cultivate in heart and
mind Wholesome attitudes for the protection and kind treatment of. all liv—

ing creatures.

“Oh, we haven’t time for it; every moment is full noun" .\n under—
standable and familiar retort of many a harrassed and busy teacher. And
yet, education is not enough unless children are given an insight into the
ethical and moral problems of our age. The underlying aim of llumane
Education is to help children through an understanding of truthful observa—
tions of nature and varied experiences with animals to learn that unneces—

sar sufferin and cruelt are degrading to one’s character.
#5 b

Humane Education is not a separate subject of the curriculum. .It
should be a part of the total elementary educational program, correlated

with most subjects of the curriculum.

Animals are an important part of our lives. .=\ very small minority of
people do not like dogs and cats and other pets, and considering the com—
panionship, loyalty, and love they offer us for a minimum of our time and

energy, such an attitude is hard to understand and to accept.

Animal pets as family members perform some useful tasks and should
have a great hold on our affection. Children should, of course. have pets.
Even the timid and fearful child should be patiently taught that. with gentle-
ness and a degree of conﬁdence, a dog or cat will become a trusted friend
and playmate. As soon as a child becomes old enough to accept responsi-
bility for owning a pet, he should be made to realize it is a partnership. For
the pleasure and satisfaction the animal gives the child. he should provide
proper living quarters, food and care, and at all times, kindness. The child
will learn that sometimes this necessary care will involve inconvenience
and sacriﬁce for himself. l’ermitting a child to be lax in his duties to the
animal or to tease or torment it may be responsible for undesirable traits
that often persist into adult lives. Let us make use of a child’s inherent in—
terest in all forms of animal life by integrating the sul_i)jects of the curricu—
lum to the end that a child will gain such attributes as thoughtfulness, kind—

liness, patience, and unselﬁshness _ the true aim in the character develop-
ment of the child.

 

 

 




 

 

 

Suggested Activities

Begin with some animal or bird that children know or have seen, or
claims their interest. For younger children their ﬁrst choice will
probably be their own pets, the dog, the cat, the canary, the goldﬁsh.

Discover the many different kinds and breeds of these domestic
animals.

Note the characteristics and habits of these creatures.
llow primitive people domesticated animals.
\Vhy the Egyptians and Persians worshipped animals.

Find out how animals have been useful to man in the past as well as
today.

A knowledge that great men like Lincoln, Sir Walter Scott, Daniel
Webster, St. Francis of Assisi, and many others had a love for animals.
Understanding the need for preventing cruelty to animals.

Learn something of the work that was done by the pioneers of pre—
vention of cruelty ~— men like Richard Martin, Henry Bergh, George
T. Angell, and Francis H. Rowley.

Appreciate the fact that S. P. C. A.’s and Humane Societies care for
stray and unwanted animals.

Realize that animals, like people, have many of the same diseases and
often need medical treatment.

Introduce the child to the best books and pictures of animals, for they
will do much to kindle their interest and to develop a sensitivity to the
needs, comfort, and rights of these animals.

Such activities will beneﬁt the child as well as the animal. Humanity,

as we commonly use the word, relates to man’s treatment of his fellow man.
The grmvth of humanity has its roots in the teaching of justice, kindness,
and servie to others and a reverence for life, all needed to make the future

good citizen.

Our Garden Friends, the Birds

Children that have interesting and meaningful opportunities to take
part in projects of nature study are seldom a problem for discipline. Birds
are indispensable to agriculture, to our gardens, and forest. \Ve could not
live without them. Observers of birds soon become. bird lovers and strong
defenders of their rights. Birds are so beautiful in color and lovely in song
they attract and hold our attention. Point out to our children that what
little damage some species may inflict, they pay for their keep many times
over and should be preserved. Heavy ﬁnes are the penalty for killing any
song bird. They are our devoted servants asking no pay but the right to live.

Suggested Activities

Procure a set of Audubon bird cards.

Compare the description of the bird with the picture.
Study its nesting habits, the eggs, and their markings.
Indentiﬁcation is not enough; learn its life habits.

Have child state its experiences with birds it has seen.

P‘P‘ﬁkiﬁNf“

Frequent trips to the woods to observe and learn the calls and songs of

of the birds.
7. Keep a bird calendar of migratory birds, the date of arrival and the
name of the pupil who saw it ﬁrst.

Suggested Activities
Make a survey of school and adjacent plantings to discover how many
attract birds.
Make wooden nesting boxes for speciﬁc birds.
Setting out bird baths.
Hang out nesting materials.
Erect feeding stations.

Appreciations

Learn of the economic value of birds in preventing the increase of
hisects.

Learn that. the earth would soon become uninhabitable without the
birds.
Birds are our devoted servants, asking but the right to live.

Learn that chickens, ducks, turkeys, and pigeons are birds and require
much knowledge and care and proper quarters.

Emphasize especially during the Easter Season that baby chickens and
ducklings are unsuitable as pets and should never be purchased by or
for boys and girls.

Animal Friends in our Gardens

Every plant and weed in our gardens provides interesting material. for

a fundamental knowledge of nature’s ways besides their names and uses
and how to cultivate them. Every earthworm working below the soil is
doing good for the garden. Every bee that vists the garden and ﬂowers is
carrying pollen for the germination of the seeds. Every bird that nests
nearby is doing something to help the life and growth of the garden. Snakes,
too, like the garter and garden snake are harmless little creatures and like
the toad catch many harmful insects.

Appreciations

Arouse a curiosity of the life habits of our garden animals.

Stimulate a kindly interest towards them because of all their help to us.
Cultivate by understanding the interrelationships of nature’s forces and
their larger application.

Develop by knowledge the power of discrimination and a wide sympa—
thy for those creatures so often misunderstood.

By your inﬂuence change the minds of the careless to attitudes of
thoughtfulness and the cruel to attitudes of kindness.

Activities
Visit some farm or the school garden.
Purchase or construct a glass terrarium.

Walk beside some pond or stream and observe the many forms of life.

P953?“

For a limited time keep some tree frogs, toads, turtles, and make them
comfortable in the terrarium in natural surroundings —— then free them
to their natural habitat.

Collect cocoons and chrysalises from trees and shrubs. Place them in a
cage until the moths and butterﬂies emerge ; then free them immediately.

Goldﬁsh and their care

A well—managed aquarium should be part of the equipment of every
school. It does much to place the children in a position of sympathetic un—
derstanding of plant and animal life. In a successful aquarium one may ob—
serve the whole life history of snails and frogs, the wonderful balance that
nature maintains between plant and animal life. It should also produce in
the child’s mind a feeling of reverent respect for the laws that govern all
life.

Goldﬁsh, due to the lack of knowledge and insufﬁcient care of the
owner, are shOrt—lived. In order that the goldﬁsh may live the normal span
of eight years, time should be taken for the preparation of a well—balanced
aquarium before the ﬁsh are purchased.

Desirable habits and attitudes for children
Realize that goldﬁsh need air, food, light, and a clean, warm home.
Understand that goldﬁsh need a large aquarium with straight sides.

Know that the aquarium should be away from direct sunlight.

:P‘FNNE“

Learn that water plants are necessary because the goldﬁsh need the
oxygen given off from growing plants, and enjoy hiding under them.

5. Learn that snails help to keep the water clean.

Suggested Activities

1. Take plenty of time to arrange a balanced aquarium.

a. Put two inches of clean sand and pebbles into the bottom of the
aquarium. Plant clean nilfoil, horn-wort, or water weed in this.

b. Fill aquarium with rain or brook water. A gallon is needed for each
inch of ﬁsh, and for one or two snails.

e. Let water settle for several days to become the temperature of the
'room. .

(1. Buy the ﬁsh and snails when aquarium is ready.

2. Care for goldﬁsh.
a. Feed a small amount of food every other day. Uneaten food is an
indication of overfeeding. Remove this to prevent decay.
b. Replace evaporated water with water of room temperature.

Use a stick to remove any plant that dies. Try not to touch the ﬁsh.
(1. \Vatch ﬁsh. If they are swimming near the top, they need more air.
Put in more growing plants, and scoop up the water to aerate it.

e. if one ﬁsh dies, rebuild the aquarium. Dissolve one crystal of per—
manganate in water of the same temperature as that of the aquarium.

l’ut the surviving ﬁsh into this for twenty minutes.

The sponsors of this leaﬂet, it must be repeated, do not seek to add to a
full curriculum. An interest in nature study and animal life is a part of the
subject matter in most schools. Our contribution is the integration of these
and other studies with a growing, kindly attitude and concern for all living
creatures. Sympathy and consideration for them is aroused when children
learn that members of the animal kingdom can suffer pain and distress from
neglect or acts of cruelty. Let us in our contacts with our country’s greatest
resource, our children, provide opportunities to guide and develop these
desirable attitudes for living together harmoniously. Inevitably, as life un—
folds, our children will learn of its problems and the need of kindness in
their relationships with other people, if we are to have a better world.

THE KINDNESS CLUB

N AN ARTICLE published in this maga-

zine just two years ago, the Kindness

Club was launched. Since that time it
has attracted attention on four continents,
and hundreds of branches have been
formed in Canada and in the United
States, a few in Britain and New Zealand,
with inquiries coming in from Africa and
India.

The ATLANTIC ADVOCATE

A Progress Report

by AIDA FLEMMING

Why this rapid spread of a club meant
originally for the children of Fredericton ?
The answer must be that the children
themselves want it. “Out came the chil-
dren running” when they heard the magic
music in the word—kindness. “The minute
I heard the name, I wanted to join,” one
little boy said. Adults who have had the
happy experience of helping children form

14

a Kindness Club ﬁnd it easy to agree with
the ﬁndings of a recent survey made by
the University of Illinois which states that
the average child’s most basic interest is
in animals, and not in sport, recreation,
machines or applied science as many
parents and teachers suppose.

For this natural interest children take
in animals, the Kindness Club provides

DECEMBER 1961

 




an ideal outlet. They like the way it is
organized with each Branch taking the
name of a bird or an animal, and the
adult adviser being known as the Racoon
Captain. At meetings, they like to be
addressed as Beaver Bill or Chipmunk
Cathy, or whatever it may be, as each
member is called by his Christian name
preﬁxed by the name of his Branch. Rules
for the club have been carefully formulated
so as to give members all the responsibility
they will take; to encourage them to adopt
a local project which will help animals
and birds; and incidentally, to teach them
how properly to conduct a meeting.

The prayer of the Kindness Club is:

Dear Father, hear and bless

Thy beasts and singing birds
And guard with tenderness
Small things that have no words.

Its pledge is: I promise to be kind to
animals (as well as people) and to speak
and act in defence of all helpless living
creatures.

The motto is: Be Kind!

To become a member, each child signs
the above pledge, and sells one packet of
Kindness Club hasti-notes or Christmas
cards, which sell twelve for sixty-nine
cents in a cellophane-wrapped package.
The purpose of selling Kindness Cards is
twofold: in the ﬁrst place, sales help pay
for supplies, which are numerous, ex-
pensive (though printed without proﬁt),
and all free to members; and secondly,
every card sent by anyone, anywhere,
helps spread the gospel of kindness.

The purpose of the Club is to induce
children (and grown-ups) to think about
being kind to every creature that lives
and suffers just as we do; and to ﬁnd out
how to be kind by learning everything
possible about the needs and natures of
animals and birds. For it is certainly true
that a great deal of cruelty is due to
thoughtlessness and ignorance. Club ac-
tivities cultivate in members habits of
kindness by constantly providing them
with opportunities to do kind things. The
Kindness Club is the positive approach
to the prevention of cruelty. Its method
is humane education.

What exactly is humane education? It
is the “impressing on the receptive minds
of boys and girls those principles of love,
compassion and kindness on which the
security and permanence of civilized so-
ciety depend.” May it not be because we
have not been giving highest priority in
our homes, our churches and our schools
to humane education that we are now
being threatened with the wiping out of
all civilized life on earth?

Perhaps there is still time. Senator F. A.
McGrand, president of the Federated
Humane Societies of Canada, says: “The
Creator placed man on earth as His
steward to administer this earthly domain
with reason, justice and mercy. And now

The ATLANTIC ADVOCATE

at long last, in this hazardous atomic age,
is man beginning to realize that, ulti-
mately, there can be no respect for human
life if there is no respect for life itself?”

There is increasing general uneasiness
that in some schools today a programme
is being conducted at great expense to
the taxpayer in education for delinquency.
For this reason, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
recently wrote as follows to the president
of the National Parent-Teachers’ Associa-
tion in the United States: “I would like
to join with those who sympathize with
the principles of humane education and
urge you to include a discussion on this
vital matter and reinstate humane educa—
tion on the programme of the P.T.A. It
seems to me of greatest importance to
teach our children respect for life. Toward
this end, experiments on living animals in
classrooms should be stopped. To en-
courage cruelty—in the name of science—
can only destroy the ﬁner emotions of
affection and sympathy and breed an un-
feeling callousness in the young toward
suﬁfering in all living creatures.”

The racoon is the emblem of the Kindness
Club

On the other hand, encouraging chil-
dren to think about being kind and to do
kind things is bound to make them hap-
pier—and better—human beings. Already
there have been many speciﬁc instances
of children considered delinquents whose
outlook has been changed through mem-
bership in the Kindness Club. Such young
people are helped by being accepted as
part of a group, and quickly learn from
other members that it is the bully who is
the coward, and the kind boy or girl
willing to stand up for the helpless, who
is truly courageous and worthy of ad-
miration.

When the Kindness Club was founded
it was hoped that funds from card sales
would make it possible to put full-time
humane education workers in the ﬁeld
available at all times to visit groups of
children in schools, youth organizations,
and playgrounds to organize projects
which would inculcate habits of kindness
and, at the same time, be educational and
entertaining. This project is still far from
fulﬁlment as card sales do not as yet begin
to pay for club supplies, let alone salaries
for ﬁeld workers.

The ideal, of course, is to have teachers
whose hearts are in humane education
visiting classrooms regularly as an integral

16

part of the school system. In the meantime,
we have an excellent example of a co-
operative eﬁbrt between the schools and
the S.P.C.A. in Hamilton, Ontario, where
Miss Evelyn Burgess, educational secre-
tary of the S.P.C.A., carries on a wonder-
ful programme for the students. She
writes: “Again this year, we have over
30,000 Junior Humane members . . . This
year in the schools, my talks have been
used as tests for essays right through the
grades and one Inspector was amazed at
the amount the kiddies in the kinder-
garten retained. There is a poster contest
going on now and the children’s general
interest in the prevention of cruelty is
high... I am amazed at the general
apathy (among adults) about a subject
which I consider the very ﬁnest for
character building.”

A few comments on the Kindness Club
give some idea of how it is being received
by a variety of people. The Humane
Society of the United States writes: “It
is the best thing of its kind which has
yet come to our notice. We will suggest
to children who write us that they get in
touch with headquarters in Fredericton
and form a Kindness Club.”

A Racoon Captain from Port Credit,
Ontario, says: “Our Kindness Club has
twelve charming and enthusiastic mem-
bers. I hope to have a second club started
before Christmas. This is the kind of work
I can put my whole heart into.”

A young member from West Sunbury,
Pennsylvania, comments: “I enjoy being
a member of this wonderful, Club. When
I grow up, don’t be surprised when some
day you hear that an Animal Shelter has
been built in the hills of West Sunbury
County by me—Linda Chaff!”

A business man from Los Gatos, Cali-
fornia, writes: “The simplicity and good-
ness of the Kindness Club idea make me
believe that something like it can get
going everywhere very soon. Send me the
supplies and I am willing to devote a
good deal of time to establishing it here.”

Dr. Harry Lillie, that great humani-
tarian and second Dr. Schweitzer, says
in a letter: “I certainly have not seen
anything to compare with the Kindness
Club and friends here in Britain are most
interested.”

Sister Veronice, O.S.F., well-known
educator of Washington, D.C., who
teaches science to science teachers, refers
to the Kindness Club in a recent article
as follows: “One practical method that
Fredericton has instituted is the Kindness
Club, whose object is to inculcate the love
and knowledge of birds and animals into
the minds of children and to provide
funds for recreational and educational
activities along those lines, and for the
provision of animal shelters, bird boxes,
veterinarian services and other humane
work. The children raise funds by selling
packets of Kindness cards. Each branch

To ensure that Kindness Club meetings
are educational as well as fun, a guide
book for leaders is now in the hands of
the publishers, Brunswick Press of Fred-
ericton. Each programme consists of a
true and original story told to entertain
and at the same time to point out that
animals are indeed worthy of our respect
and protection, followed by hints from

been learned, and ﬁnally, exercises for
physical ﬁtness, and a game set to music.

It has been said that the degree of
civilization which a community or a
country has attained is best judged by
the degree of humaneness it exercises in
its treatment of animals. Those who know
the facts will readily agree that in this
regard most North American communities
lag far behind Britain and the Scandinav-
ian countries. The Kindness Club is one
vehicle for the improvement of our
standards.

Conservationists agree that we are

tion and the virtual extinction or many
valuable species of wildlife. Education
can win only when the majority of our
people are willing to join with Ruskin
in the following pledge: “I will not kill
or hurt any living creature needlessly,
nor destroy any beautiful thing, but will
strive to save and comfort all gentle life,
and guard all natural beauty upon the
earth.”

If it were not for the regrettable
example set by a great many adults, most
children would gladly set their feet on
the gentle path of conservation and com-
passion to follow the Call of Kindness
all the days of their lives.

ne sunny summer afternoon about six
years ago, when I was twelve, I walked
around the block to see my friend
Johnny McGuire. Like me, he had been rais-
ing pigeons, and he had just had some bad luck.
One way to teach a young pigeon to ﬂy is to
toss it a foot or two into the air when it is
about ﬁve weeks old, catching it if it doesn’t
take off. But Johnny had been trying too early
and too high. Squeeks, the three-week-old
mixed-breed that he had thrown off his garage
roof, just hadn’t made it. When I got there the
pigeon was ﬂuttering on the hard ground, one
of its wings dislocated and bent under it.

I had just ﬁnished reading a library book
about animal and bird care, so I knew what to
do. I rushed Squeeks to my house, carefully
put the wing back into place and tightly taped
it to her trembling body. She moped around
the coop with my other ﬁfteen or so pigeons
for several weeks before I cut the bandages off.
The wing seemed to have healed.

For weeks my friends and I watched her,
wondering whether Squeeks ever would make
her ﬁrst ﬂight. She did it quite unexpectedly
on a bright fall afternoon. One minute she was
walking on the ground, quietly hunting for
dropped seed. The next she was air-borne.
Proud of her accomplishment, she circled and
recircled our yard before ﬁnally coming down
to earth again.

Squeeks now was a ﬂying pigeon instead of a
crippled one. And I had found a hobby I
liked—helping injured animals.

That’s how I came to start an animal-reha-
bilitation center in the back yard of our seven-
room house in Nutley, New Jersey, a New
York suburb just fourteen miles from Times
Square. Since the day Squeeks-ﬂew, I have
guided hundreds of birds and other animals
through my center. Some were just homeless,
abandoned by their parents or orphaned
through accident. Some were injured creatures
which I found in the woods and open parks
near Nutley, or which were brought to me by
some kind neighbor or teacher. Children and
grownups around Nutley have been glad to
ﬁnd a place where they could bring hurt ani-
mals and not be turned away.

Although I didn’t start my animal hospital
to make money, it turned out that there was a
proﬁt in it. For, after I have restored my pa—
tients to health, many of them make good pets.
Over the years I have sold quite a few of the

graduates of my back-yard center to pet shops
around Nutley and to Story Book Farm, a pri-
vate zoo in Parsippany, New Jersey, which
shows small animals in settings. from children’s
stories. The summer before last I sold two
crows, which I found in a park, for ﬁve dollars
each. An injured hawk I had saved went for
ten dollars. Some 200 hamsters and black

' mice, which I raised myself, brought in thirty-

.nine dollars more. All together I have made
around $500 thus far from my hobby—and
that money comes in handy now that I’m
eighteen, have graduated from high school
and will go to Montana State University in
September.

I made no money out of Squeeks, my ﬁrst
patient, and I never wanted to. She was prac-
tically a member of the family—so much so
that each time I came into the yard, often with
friends or neighbors, she would swoop out of a
corner of the sky and land on the top of my
head. Pigeons like to show oﬂ, too, I found.

Friendly as she was, Squeeks did run away
from home once in a while. One day after a
long absence, she returned with a handsome
friend, a black-and—white male that I recog-
nized from pictures in my pigeon books as a
tufted nun. Then several days later the two of
them ﬂew away together. I thought that I had
seen the last of Squeeks. But one cold Novem-
ber night, after she and her mate had been
gone all summer, I heard a noise at the kitchen
window, her favorite feeding station. There
was Squeeks, alone. She stayed with us all
winter, spending the cold nights on the land-
ing leading to our cellar. When spring came,
her missing mate returned. I felt sure that he
had been held captive all winter in someone’s
coop and that he ﬂew to Squeeks the ﬁrst time
he was let out. After their reunion the two
pigeons ﬂew away together, and that was the
last I saw of them.

My experiences with Squeeks set the pattern
for my animal hospital. Principally, it is a
spring-through-fall operation. Early in the
year I ﬁnd a lot of newly born birds and ani-
mals getting into trouble. During the hot sum-
mer months many of these patients and train-
ees graduate—just in time to make room for
the accident patients of early fall. When the
cold winter winds begin to blow, almost all my
patients are on the wing or back in the woods.

This seasonal schedule works out well for
both me and my family. In the summer, when

things are going full blast, I am at home to
take care of the animals. During the winter,
when I’m at school, mother pitches in to give
noon feedings to the few that are around.
Luckily for me she likes animals, for in our
small, Cape Cod-style house with a ﬁfty-by-
ﬁfty-foot back yard, even a few animals are
bound to seem like a lot when they get under
foot.

Nancy, my ﬁfteen-year-old sister, is fond of
animals, too, but she draws the line at help-
ing with things like snakes and alligators,
which I have on hand once in a while. My
brother Tommy, only seven, fears none of my
patients—not even the snakes. Dad, busy dur-
ing weekdays with his job as an assistant exec-
utive in the budget department of the Public
Service Electric and Gas Company, a utility
company in Newark, gives me a hand only on
weekends.

When I get new animals, like the two jet-
black crow babies which a boy brought to my
center in the summer of 1957, I borrow books
from the public library and read everything
I can abOut the animals’ habits, food and
diseases. And I learn from experience too.
Sometimes the lessons are sad ones. Those ﬁrst
two crows lived a few weeks on a diet of liver
and beef strips; then one accidentally stran-
gled himself on the chicken wire of the cage
I had built for them. While I was burying this
crow, some animal—a dog, I think—broke
into the cage and killed the other one.

My next pen, for the two baby crows I found
abandoned in a patch of woods near our house
last summer, was stronger and had smaller
wiring. So these two made it past babyhood.
Then their legs grew weaker and weaker and
their bodies heavier and heavier. I thought it
looked like rickets, and added calcium to their
diets in the form of cuttlebone scrapings. It
put them on their feet again, and they were
soon able to ﬂy. These were the crows I sold
to Story Book Farm. A few months later I saw
them on television when some of the farm’s
animals were shown on a New York children’s
program. I was pretty proud that day, as a
matter of fact. Besides my crows, the show fea-
tured a goat and several geese that I had also
raised and sold to Story Book.

Last spring I rescued four sharp-taloned
sparrow hawks—then just roly-poly puffs of
bird life—from the roof of a tall building. A
storm had destroyed (Continued on Page 60)

THE SATURDAY EVENING POST

My BaCk—Yard Rehabilitation Center

(Continued from Page 21)

their nest and left them orphaned. I gave
all four the same treatment, good warm
cotton nests and strips of beef and eye
droppers full of water. But one of the birds
had a crippled wing which never healed,
and another a permanently damaged leg.
Either would have been easy prey for
animal prowlers. 801 found good homes
for those two when they were grown and
tamed. They are much better off as pets
than if they were left near their nests to die.

Their two brothers, however, grew to
healthy adulthood. One warm summer
day they ﬂew high up into our willow
tree. There was a brief pause, a glance
back at the yard that had been their home
for many long months, and back to their
own world ﬂew two more of my patients.

When an animal needs special atten-
tion I transfer it to the big, six-by-two-
foot cage that I built to ﬁt into a corner
of my room. There I can keep a close eye
on the patient. There, too, the animal usu-
ally is given more freedom and allowed
to roam around the room while I am
studying. Somehow I seem to become
fondest of these pets that cause me the
most trouble.

Chip was a clever gray squirrel who de-
manded extra treatment. He came my
way when a neighbor, cleaning out a
chimney, found two tiny, helpless baby
squirrels tumbled from a nest torn beyond
repair. The mother squirrel was missing.
The neighbor had heard of my center, and
he asked if I would adopt the two orphans.

1 took them in, of course. As young
squirrels have to be kept at just the right
temperature until their fur coats develop,
I hastily made an incubator for these two
by putting a fifteen-watt light bulb,
shielded by a tin can, into a small card-
board box ﬁlled with cotton. I fed the
babies warm milk from an eye dropper
every three hours around the clock for
about two weeks. And let me tell you,
that was an awful job. I felt like a tired
mother until the night feedings were over
and I could switch those squirrels to baby
cereal and, ﬁnally, to sunﬂower seeds.

Despite the best care I could give them,
one of the squirrels died—but the other
managed to survive and became a lively
companion. That was Chip. When he got
a little older he would sometimes scamper
out my open window onto the roof, then
come back in, half an hour later, chatter-
ing all about his adventures. When I was
at school, he would spend the day on the
roof, never coming indoors until I came
into my room. And, strangely, he never
attempted to get down from the roof to
escape to his own world.

Yet too much freedom is not always
good either. I almost lost Chip because of
it. He discovered some tubes of oil paint
in my room one evening, and when I
found him he was covered with purple
paint and in pain. Quickly I forced a large
dose of Epsom salts down his throat
with an eye dropper. Even then he almost
died. His fur was soaking wet from a high
fever for days, and he became terribly
thin. But I put him back On his baby diet
and, to everyone’s surprise, he lived.

It was that summer, when Chip was
about six months old, that mother and
dad decided on a trip toFlorida. Mother
has acute rheumatoid arthritis, and the
doctor thought that taking it easy in the
sun might help her. I was able to farm out
the parakeet, the pigeons, the rabbits and
the chickens who were lodging with us
that year to friends and relatives. But no-
body wanted a mischievous young squir-
rel like Chip. Not only was he noisy, but
once in a while, when frightened, he
would run up the leg and then onto the

shoulder of the nearest person. This had
an unnerving effect on some people. Be-
cause Chip seemed too young to be set
free, I decided that he would just have to
make the lO75-mi1e trip with dad and me
in the car. Mother, Nancy and Tommy
were going separately by plane to save
mother the long car trip.

Dad wasn’t eager for Chip’s company,
but he was willing, so I brought along a
two-by-two-foot cage. Chip didn’t care
for it. Most of the time he roamed around
the back seat of our car, exploring all the
out-of-the-way corners and the dark spots
under the seats. That is, he spent his time
there when he wasn’t climbing around my
head or in and out of my shirt. Only when
we stopped for gas or meals did Chip go
into his cage.

In Daytona Beach, where we met the
rest of the family, Chip spent a wonderful
three weeks exploring the nooks and
crannies in our motel rooms while the rest
of us swam and ﬁshed and went boating.
Then dad and I started driving back to
New Jersey. Mother’s arthritis had im-
proved, but still not enough to let her
travel by car. Dad and I had plenty of
company, though. A horned toad and a
young alligator shared the back seat with
Chip.

Chip’s friends were all right in the hot
car, but I did not like leaving Chip when
we went into air-conditioned restaurants
for meals. So I found a way to smuggle
him into even the largest and most im-
pressive places—inside my shirt. He was
very co-operative, and showed his tiny
nose only for a moment or two at a time
when he reached out to munch loudly on
the pieces of lettuce I found for him.

Nobody ever noticed Chip in the res-
taurants, but we almost caused a riot one
night in a North Carolina motel when the
owner unexpectedly dropped in with fresh
linen. He had never before seen a gray
squirrel racing around his room, with a
beady—eyed horned toad sitting unblink—
ingly nearby, and a two-foot alligator
sloshing around in the shower stall. Only
our promise to keep the three animals
locked in the car for the rest of the night
saved dad and me from sleeping out there
with them.

Chip was not the only animal who did
a lot of traveling with us. In the winter of
1954 we went west in the family trailer to
see if the Arizona sun would help moth-
er’s arthritis. About noon on January
twelfth—I remember the date because it
was my thirteenth birthday—a dirty black-
and-white puppy, looking something like
a springer spaniel, came cringing into our
Tucson trailer park. She had just been
chased with a big stick by the motel
owner next door. She needed a friend
badly, someone to pet her and feed her. I
did both.

After that I knew that I wanted to keep
her. But it wasn’t that easy. Five of us
were living in our trailer; mother and dad
pointed out that there wasn’t much space
for even a small dog. So I took her to the
Pima County dog shelter. Ten days later,
however, when they were about to lead
her to the gas chamber because no one
had claimed her, mother and dad changed
their minds and said that I could use my
$6.50 in birthday money to pay the charges
and take her home. I almost gave up when
I was told at the shelter that the charges
came to nine dollars. Then the man said
something like, “Well, she’s only a small
puppy. She didn’t eat much. You can
have her for $6.50.” I carried Spotty
home in my arms. My ﬁrst dog.

One week later, just as Spotty and I
were getting to know each other, my fam-

ily hurriedly decided to return to New
Jersey. Dad’s legs were crumpling under
him. A Tucson doctor thought it was the
ﬂu, but when the legs got worse dad sus-

pected spinal trouble, which might have.

meant a long stay in the hospital. He sold
the trailer and arranged for the car to be
freighted east, while I managed to get
Spotty into a small shipping cage for the
long trip by express across the continent.
Then the ﬁve of us ﬂew home, jammed
into the four front seats of an airliner.
Eighteen hours after leaving Tucson—
long before Spotty arrived—dad was in a
New Jersey hospital. It was polio.

Dad’s paralyzed legs and right arm
conﬁned him to the Essex County Isola-
tion H0spital in Belleville and, later, in
the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in
West Orange for seven months. But with
the help of the good Lord, wheel chairs,
stroller, long leg braces and special
crutches, he learned to walk again. He is
now almost back to normal.

Spotty stayed with us a long time. I put
the shipping cage in a warm spot next to
the kitchen stove; it became her dog
house. For years she helped me search for
other animals along the dense forests of
the Appalachian Trail, only sixty miles

from Nutley, where dad used to take us
until I learned to drive myself. For a
while She had patients of her own. Her
ﬁrst puppy, whose father was a mixed
breed from the neighborhood, died. The
six she had from her next two litters,
whose fathers we never were sure of, grew
strong on a diet of cereal and meat. All of
them went to happy homes in and around
Nutley. But Spotty is dead, run over by a
car last summer.

One patient I had a lot of success with
was Robbie, a red—breasted robin found
wandering confused and bewildered in
one of the main corridors of Nutley High
School in the spring of 1957. A kind
teacher tried to locate the baby’s family,
but it was nowhere to be found. He needed
attention, besides; he was limping and he
seemed weak, possibly from hunger. The
teacher, who had heard of my center,
brought him to me for help.

Robbie’s chances for survival seemed
good. Right from the start he seemed
eager to co-operate. I constructed a cot-
ton nest for temporary quarters for him.
Then I tackled the food problem, drib-
bling water into him from an eye drop-
per, giving him bits of fruit or chopped
meat or occasional worm titbits I dug up
in the back yard. I have since been told
that the water wasn’t too good an idea,
for baby birds can get along without it,

I and sometimes water can actually be
harmful to them. But Robbie grew healthy,
and his limp disappeared.

From the moment Robbie started ﬂy-
ing, about two weeks after he came to me,
he started getting into trouble. One day
he entered a hole in a neighbor’s screened
porch, then couldn’t ﬁgure how to get out
again. A tirade of frantic screeches soon
brought help—a lot of it—including half

 

a dozen anxious ladies from the neighbor-

'hood. Another time he became curious
about a neighbor’s collapsible plastic
swimming pool—so curious that he fell
in. Mother found a sorry-looking wet
robin crying at the open kitchen door.

As Robbie grew older, however, his
temperament seemed to change. He be-
came less friendly, less interested in hu-
man beings, more independent. Then, just
at dusk one evening, it happened. He an-
swered the call of the wild and ﬂew away
with a ﬂock of robins to spend his ﬁrst
night away from home. He returned often
after that, but never seemed the same.
Once we saw him even dive-bomb the
crippled hawk with which he. had been
raised. That fall, when the red-breasted
robins ﬂew south, Robbie was with them,
looking just like the rest except for his
smaller size and the pinkish color of his
chest. Apparently, living with people had
made him just a little different.

Next spring, though, Robbie was back,
announcing his return with noisy screeches
outside our kitchen window. Then he
found a mate and was soon busily engaged
in raising a family. His babies, however,
were always kept at a safe distance. Even
Robbie himself never comes too near me
any more. But whenever I spoke to him
last summer he still couldn’t resist twitch-
ing his tail excitedly and hopping just a
little closer.

Robbie was pretty popular with the
neighborhood. Many of the boys and
girls around our block have given me a
hand with the animals over the years, al-
though not all of my patients have been
welcomed by their parents. One year
someone complained to the Nutley Board
of Health, and I had to sell the thirty to
thirty-ﬁve pigeons I had then. Whoever
made the complaint, however, couldn’t
blame me when the pigeons got away
from their new owner, ﬂew home and
spent weeks sitting, around on the neigh-
borhood roOfs,hoping to be allowed back
in our yard.

There were a lot of funny looks,
too, the time I bought a chestnut mare
for $125 out of my center’s earnings,
and they unloaded her from a van in front
of my house. I was planning to keep her
in a Nutley stable, as I did for a year or
so, but I guess the neighbors thought that
she was going to live in the back yard with
my other guests. And one time when a
snake that I had found in the woods died,
the garbage man was pretty surprised to
ﬁnd him in our refuse can the following
morning. He was so startled, in fact, that
he ran over to the house next door and
asked for an aspirin.

Still, even though my hobby sometimes
gives me more trouble than the neighbors
think it’s worth, I’m going to stick with it.
Have you ever seen a bird that has fallen
from its nest? It’s usually a tangled mess
of feathers and limbs. When you see the
same bird ﬂying gracefully and effortlessly
to the top of the tallest willow—well, it
just makes you feel good all over. You
feel even better when you see a former un-
fortunate like Robbie, all grown up now,
proudly return to the back yard to show
off his unsteady brood‘.

I guess that my interests have always
been tuned to the outdoors. Once, when I
was in the sixth grade, I took up the cello,
but it wasn’t for me. I turned to the guitar
and songs from the West, which I still

play. If all goes the way I hope it will, I .

plan to spend my life in the open, maybe
in range management or in forestry in
Alaska or the West. I liked it out there
when I used to take camping trips in the
trailer with mother and dad.

However things turn out, you can be
sure of one thing. Somewhere in my fu-
ture there will be another rehabilitation
center for animals—ea bigger one. _

CREATIVITY AS A CHARACTERISTIC CF GIFTED CHILDREN

We have described the gifted child in abstract intelligence and in the area
of science. Some children may often be identified by use of an intelligence test.
Certainly a high intelligence test rating is one characteristic of such a child.
However, there are children whose abilities in art music or writing, though rare
and distinctive, can be recognized chiefly by their performance-~cases in which
intelligence tests will prove inadequate for their identification.

Perhaps it is desirable to broaden our definition of the gifted and to consider
any child as ”gifted” whose performance, in a valuable line of human activity, is
consistently or repeatedly remarkable....

The symbolic and imaginative film, THE HUNTER IN THE FCREST, prepared by the
distinguished cameraman, Arne Sucksdorff, was shown in 79 classrooms in 40 schools
located in 34 cities. All elementary grades were represented. The 8-minute
motion picture is presented without narration or dialogue. The film has a musical
score with sound effects to accompany the appearance of birds and animals.

....the children....are invited to write their own stories about the film....

Over 2,000 children wrote stories after viewing the film...

Two hundred and three, or about 10 per cent, of the total number of compositions
were judged to be outstanding and to suggest potential ability on the part of the

writerSoooo

....reveals a great sensitivity on the part of this child as well as originality

THE HUNTER AND HUNIED (Elem. School Child)

A hunter left his house
walked into the forest
saw a bird

shot the bird

put a feather in his hat
and walked on

Fixed his hat

saw a deer

father, mother and fawn
Picked up his gun
ready to shoot

thought

and stopped

and walked on.32

THE HUNTER AND THE FCREST, CR WCRLD PERFECT

Once upon a time there was a beautiful forest. In it were the graceful deer,
the comical grouse, and the beauty of flowers and trees. Near this forest lived
a hunter, oblivious to these things. He was out for sport. He walked through
the beautiful forest, crushing the tender blossoms, and breaking boughs of lovely
trees. He saw a grouse, done up in feather finery, and killed it. He then put
one of its tail feathers in his hat. Then he went home satisfied with the day‘s kill.
Then a rain came. The flowers, sprinkled with shining diamonds did their exotic
rain ballet. The trees swayed too, with the gentle beat of the rain. The next
day, the hunter again went into the forest. He set up a net for some unwary animal.

 




Then something caught his eye. It was a deer family, grazing peacefully by the
water. His hand touched the trigger. JUst then something wonderful happened.

As a flower Opens, slowly, slowly, so the hunter&s heart and eyes opened, slowly,
slowly. The hunter, the destroyer of nature awoke. Why, this wasn‘t something to
destroy. It was something beautiful, sacred, it was the unspoiled, perfect beauty
of God and nature. The hunter took down his net, lowered his gun and started home.
Instead of a stalk, his steps were light and springy. The birds chirped. The
squirrels shattered. ‘Why hadn‘t he seen this before? He threw down the grouse
feather, the symbol of his slaughter and put in its place a delicate flower. He
walked along whistling.

It was thus that the hunter found what so many long to find, a new world,
a heaven on earth, a paradise. Itﬁs everywhere. It‘s beauty, purity, exotic
grace. It is beauty of Venus, the kingdom of Pan, the haunts of Diana. Here,
there is no past, no future, just now. Beautiful, happy now!33....

Similarly, creative ability will be dis layed in music, painting and drawing, and
in other fields.... (by skillful performance?

Introduction

to a Humane

Education Program

 




 

INTRODUCTION TO A
HUMANE EDUCATION PROGRAM

Through the years, The American
Humane Association has patiently
worked toward afunctional program
on humane education that could be
used in public and private schools
by animal welfare organizations and
other interested or dedicated groups
of peOple who sincerely desire to help
educate our citizens by furnishing
adequate and-authentic information
on the humanecare‘andtreatment of
animals.

 

The program now available to such
organizations has been set up through
The American Humane Association's
Humane Education Committee. Each
member of this committee is a rep-
resentative of a different regional
area of the United States and each
one is actively engaged in the field
of humane education.

Local animal welfare organizations
wishing to institute such an educa-
tional program will find that our pam-
phlet, "TEN TESTED STEPS," is
most helpful. It is included in the

cc
ca
ha
1i:
ti<




complete plan for your program be—
cause, by actual test, these steps
have been found necessary in estab—
lishing a successful humane educa-
tion program.

The complete plan includes step by
step information for initiating and
conducting a humane education pro-
gram that will be adequate for use
in three distinct age level brackets:

l . Primary
(Kinde rgarten through third
grade.)

2. Intermediate
(Fourth through eighth
grades.)

3. High School
(or Adult Audiences. )

The purpose of this material is to
make available the source of each
film which is recommended in the
planned outline - its cost, ifany, and
the nearest distribution center to
your organization. A synopsis of
each film allows you to choose the
most suitable film for your Special
purpose. Also included is an out-

 




line of materials which can be uti—
lized in order to follow up or to create
and keep alive the interest of the
group to which the program has been
presented.

American Humane Associationhead—
quarters or any ofthe field directors

will be most cooperative in answer—-

ing your questions or supplying you
with this material -- you need only
to ask.

TEN TESTED STEPS

An outline to follow in establishing
a Humane Education Program.

The American Humane Association
has prepar ed and revised its program
material in order- to assist animal
welfare organizations to present a
Humane Education Program. SEE:
”INTRODUCTION _ To .A HUMANE
EDUCATION PROGRAM. "

The purpose of humane education is
teaching attitudes of kindness and
understanding towardhuman and ani-
mal life . When these ideals are pre—
sented effectively, they have a valu-
able place in the development of char-
acter in a child.

The local animal welfare society
wishing to establish such aprogram
should follow these TEN TESTED
STEPS.

The Board of Directors should

take formal action to determine

the followizn'g;'_'g

a. Their desire to make such
a pr og rar'n available in their
area. " I

by. J The ;.e!xt_ent of the funds that

'l “ cangb‘e Obtainedfor this use.

The Pre s ident shall appoint from

" the membership of the Board of
'- Directors, one person who is
to be the Chairman of the Hu-

m a n e Education Committee .
This choice will enable the com-

 

 

 

 

mittee's workto be more closely
co-ordinated with the entire pro-
gram of the society. The Pres-
ident and the Chairman shoul d .
then select the other members
of the committee. If possible,
the committee should include a
school official who will be inval-
uable in co-ordinat ing the educa-
tion program with the existing
school curriculum.

The committee should determine
the extent of the program to be
presented and carried to com-
pletion the first year, based
on: (1) Availability of funds;
(2) Availability of personnel;
(3) The number of schools to be
served. It is expedient for the
initial program to be limited to
Primary presentations. This
experience will guide your pro-
gram expansion.

The Chairman of the committee
should meet the Superintendent
of Schools (or the person he des-
ignates) in order to outline the
tentative program its objectives
and the method of presentation.
IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE
THE CO-OPERATION OF THE
SCHOOL AUTHORITIES.

With the foregoing steps com—
pleted, the committee now se—
lects the Director of Humane
Education - the person who will
'present the program. It is es-
sential to have a person who is

 

 

kin’d, understanding, andhas had
some'working experience with
children. Formerteachers are
ideal for this work. It must be
remembered, however, that lei-
sure time and afondness for ani-
mals are not the sole qualifica-
tions for this position.

The Director of Humane Educa-
tion will now select the program
‘material using the approvedl‘ist
of films from The American
Humane Association. A com-
plete program can be chosen or
a similar one can be created,
us ing The American Humane
Association program as a guide.
Either program should include
pertinent information concern-
ing your local society.

Supplementary material should
now be assembled. These are a-
Vailable from The American Hu-
mane Association headquarters .

The Director is now able to pre-
sent a complete program to the
designated school authority. The
school may wish to have other
members of the school adminis—
tration previewthe program be-
fore giving final approval.

When approved,‘ the '~ immediate
scheduling of individual schools
should begin in accordance with
the recommendations of the




school official consulted in STEP
EIGHT. You have now assumed
a reSpons ibility in which you
must not fail!

Rriodically, the program should
be evaluated and any necessary
changes made promptly. Pro-
gram evaluation sheets, com—
pleted byteachers whose classes

have seen the programs, are
ext re inelyhelpful in maintaining
the effectiveness of your pres—
entation. (Sample evaluation
sheets are included with each

kit of program Inaterial.)

the A“..Purpose Subject.

as. N 'oUN-CE or PREVENTION . . . ” begins the old adage, the

truth of which is unquestioned. But, like brushing your
teeth after every meal, sometimes it just isn’t possible to guard
against the future when the present is so demanding.

SPCA’s, for instance, are generally brought into being to ﬁll
a pressing need which has reached emergency proportions.
When an injured animal is lying in the street, untended, rescue
must take precedent over the most penetrating discussion of

how it happened.

Eventually, though, every society must move beyond the
critical stage so as to be able to give thought to the prevention
of cruelty, neglect and abuse. Established societies, such as The
San Francisco SPCA, have long recognized education as the
best means of achieving this goal. Together with other humane
organizations that maintain fulltime humane education depart-
ments, we have for several years developed simpliﬁed programs
which even beginning societies can produce with a minimum
of manpower and money, in an effort to“ help more of them
over this hurdle.

On October 18, a full session of the national convention of
The American Humane Association in Denver will be devoted
to this important subject. Leaders in humane education from
Maine to California will outline the work as it is conducted
by them in their part of the country. It is our great hope that
the many societies represented in the audience will be inspired
to take a similar step in preventive animal care.

Miss Dale Robbins, Teaching Representative of The San
Francisco SPCA, will be among those taking part in the forum.
By the time this issue of OUR ANIMALS is published Miss Robbins
will have given a talk from which the following is taken.

SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER 1961

As the poet Wordsworth said,
“The child is father of the man.”
A person’s outlook is formed dur-
ing early childhood, and his con-
duct in adult life depends upon
his innermost feelings or convic-
tions. Good manners and a sense
of moral obligation are not inher-
ent—they must be taught, and this
is where humane education comes
in. I concentrate on the elementary
schools because children of these
ages are most receptive.

Our purpose in having a humane
education program is twofold. Ani-
mals are not the only ones who
beneﬁt. When children gain such
sympathy for animals that they do
not tease or mistreat them, there is
a strong likelihood that they will
treat each other with greater con-
sideration.

I teach humane education in the
individual classroom because it is
more personal than trying to ad-
dress a large, mixed-age group in
an auditorium. This makes it pos-
sible to adapt my talk to the vari-
ous age levels, and it also gives the
children a chance to ask questions
and to tell about their pets.

For the past six years The San
Francisco SPCA has had a fulltime

humane education program. Pre-

viously, our education activities
consisted of distributing OUR ANI-
MALS magazine to schools, public

\

libraries, and other places. Scouts,
both boys and girls, came to us
after school for help on their dog
and cat care merit badges, and
often we had other groups come for
conducted tours of the shelter. We
still do these things, as a natural
adjunct to our enlarged school pro-
gram. Also, various staff members,
including myself, presented special
programs in school auditoriums
during Be Kind to Animals Week.
These programs, consisting of a
brief talk, followed by a movie
about animals, were always well
received, because we stressed com-
monsense, never extreme, views.
We had established an excellent
reputation with the schools, so that
when we were ﬁnally able to have
a fulltime program of humane edu-
cation the schools were most eager
to cooperate.

We have been fortunate, too, in
having two of San Francisco’s best
known educators as interested mem-
bers of our Society’s Board of Trus-
tees: the late Dr. A. J. Cloud, at
one time Assistant Superintendent
of Public Schools, and then Presi-
dent of the San Francisco City Col-
lege, as well as President of our
Society; and Dr. Harold Spears,
present Superintendent of Public

Schools.

I“

HUMANE EDUCATION—continued from page ID

is to succeed, it is necessary to have
the right person teach it. Who is
the right person? One who can talk
to the children at their various
levels, in order to hold their inter-
est. In addition to liking animals
the teacher of humane education
must have a concrete knowledge of
their needs, as well as their habits
and general characteristics. She—
or he—must have the poise to with-
stand—and answer——any child’s
question. When a child relates some
sad or cruel happening, tearful
chidings on the part of the teacher
would accomplish nothing. It is
necessary to be constructive.

For instance, when a child tells
me about his parakeet flying out the
open window, I say something like,
“Well, let’s hope he ﬂew into some
other house and that he’s living
there happily. Maybe some day you
will get another bird, and if you do,
be sure to keep all doors and win-
dows closed whenever he is out of
the cage. A pet bird cannot take
care of himself outdoors.”

The teacher of humane education
also needs teaching experience. I
got mine from working in chil-
dren’s museums for several years
prior to joining the staff of The
San Francisco SPCA. My duties in
these museums included tours,
story hours, hobby and pet clubs.

Perhaps you wonder why I left the
museum ﬁeld. In my pet clubs, I
found myself more and more em-
phasizing the humane treatment of
animals rather than mere nature
study. It disturbed me very much
to have to allow the children to
come in after school and help them-
selves to the pets. They were sup-
posed to play with them, without .
my hovering in the background
worrying. But I never learned to
take it in my stride when a white
rat, a baby opossum, or a turtle
was dropped on the ﬂoor, when
harmless snakes grew limp from
too much handling, or when chil- .
dren were permitted to watch the
feeding of live mice to snakes. The
late Mr. Albert Pollard, of The
American Humane Education So-
ciety, visited my pet clubs when I
was in Boston, and he was the one
who urged me to go into humane
education work.

I regard teaching humane edu-
cation as teaching the Golden Rule.
If everyone lived by it, if he tried
to imagine how he would feel if he
were in the other person’s place,
and acted accordingly, the world
situation could not possibly be what
it is. However, with children educa-
tion must be presented in an inter-
esting way, and this means adapt-

ing my approach to their age level.

Dear Mrs.StevensE

I have wanted for some weeks to phone
and ask to see you again, hoping to give some account of
what we are trying to do in nature study after-school and
vacation programs.

Instead of taking your time to see me
alone, would you be free to attend a short meeting we will
hold on June 6th? I hOpe very much you can. There is so
much need and interest in such activity as we have been
conducting this spring that I wish you might be willing to
serve on this small project and help us make it more useful .

With my best wishes,

Sincerely yours, (-

Dear Miss Stevens:

Please excuse me for not answering your nice note of July llth sooner, but
I just haven't had the time.

You.mentioned thathr. Pollard of the American Humane Education Society told
you about my work and that you would like to learn more about it. Under
separate cover I am.sending you some copies of mimeographed material prepared
for children of the third through sixth grade. Also you will receive an old-
fashioned poster that I sent because I think it is so appealing and various
kindergarten teachers like it too. '

During the regular school year I visit elementary and junior high school
children in their individual classrooms,1;alking to them briefly about the
care and handling of pets and I try to give them.an appreciation for other
animals as well. I stress the importance of not allowing a pet to become

a nuisance to neighbors, and also point out that it is just wonderful to
gain the confidence of a squirrel or wild bird rather than chasing it or
doing something else to annoy it. I also remind them.that there are snakes
that are harmless and just because we don't like snakes as well as other
animals doesn't mean that we should harm.them. I tell them that if they
are out walking some place and see a little garter snake not to throw rocks
at it or do anything to harm it or frighten it, but simply walk away and
leave it alone.

I adapt my talks to the age level of the particular group. When I talk to
primary children my talk is in the form of a simple story, featuring Jimmy
who owns a little dog named "Paddy". For intermediates it is in the form.
of a chat, and for bunior high children it is more as if I were talking to
adults, except I give more explanations. I illustrate these talks with
large mounted pictures and charts or colored picture slides and;models.
In an elementary school I visit every room, spending from fifteen.minutes
to half- an— hour with each group, but in a junior high school I concentrate
on science and social studies classes, spending the entire period with a
class ( six periods a day ). Depending upon the size of the school I Spend
from.one to several days in each school. I prefer visiting the individual
classes to addressing a large group in the auditorium because it is a much
more personal approach and gives the children a chance to ask questions and

tell about their pets.

During school holiday periods I visit children‘s wards of hospitals, the
'Youth Guidance Center ( detention home ), child care centers, and during
the summer I also visit the various summer schools.

The children are so enthusiatic and when I re- visit a school ( I try to do
so at least twice a year and of course I present a different topic each time )
they refer to me as the "SPCA Lady". Teachers say that the children apply
these kindly feelings to each other, and that is the purpose of our humane
education program, to give children a sympathetic feeling towards pets and
other animals with the hope that they will apply these feelings to each
other.

There are always a few children who do not have pets, and I never urge them
to beg their parents to get them.one, because I feel that there may be con—
ditions at home making it undesirable to have one. Instead I suggest special
projects, such as collecting pictures and stories of animals from.newspapers
-to put in scrap books. I also suggest that they visit the zoo and decide
which animals they are most interested in, then go to the library and borrow
books about those animals. When a child has just a goldfish I try to make
him feel fortunate, and point out that even a fish can be a pet if_it is
treated as one. For instance at one school i visited a little nine- year—
old girl told me about her pet, a goldfish that she has had for four years.
She said, "He is a real pet. When I feed himMI put the food on my finger
and put my finger on top of the water and he comes up to eatl“

I stress the Golden Rule......"Treat pets and all other animals the way you
'would like to be treated if you had been born a pet or any other kind of
animal." I printed it in large letters on a piece of cardboard on which I
pasted colored pictures of animals, and I usually have one child volunteer
to read it to the class, then I have the entire class read it in unison.

I forgot to tell you that I leave the mimeographed material with the teachers
“who use it for "audience reading" and for bulletin boards. I tell the children
that if they would like to have copies they are free and if they will telephone
or‘write to us we will send them.

I hope you will find this information helpful, and if you have any further
questions please let me know. I would like to know about your work too.

Best wishes to you.

THE FIELD RANGERS

Wild-life Service
By CYRIL A. LITTLEWOOD

HE fact that we are a nation of animal

lovers cannot be denied, though we hear all
too often of domestic animals suffering great
harm at the hands of their owners because of
carelessness or lack of knowledge. Throughout
the ﬁfteen million homes in Britain there
resides a vast “pet” population which includes
some six million cats, ﬁve million dogs, over
six million cage birds, and a great host of pet
rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, mice, rats, birds,
ﬁsh, reptiles, and even insects.

For the sake of the general well-being and
comfort of all these creatures it is essential that
their owners should have at least a basic
knowledge of the care and attention required
by them. Child pet owners in particular need to
be trained in the correct care of various types of
animal, for many, many pets have been killed
as the result of unlimited love—but extremely
limited knowledge on the part of their young
owners.

The protection and conservation of wild-life
and natural resources is another vital subject
which children should be taught to understand
and trained to carry out to the best of their
ability. If, as the experts have forecast, the
population of the earth is going to be doubled
in the next forty years, a rigid conservation
programme will become a matter of inter-
national importance. In view of this, the
training of children today may help to ensure
carefully planned conservation programmes in
the future.

With all these points in mind, a small youth
club was formed in 1949 as an experiment in
the humane education of young people. By
1954, the club had a membership of over two
hundred boys and girls in the South London
Borough of VVandsworth. About ﬁfty of these
children attended regularly, the remainder were
classed as “Associates”——attending special meet-
ings only. In May 19 54 the club was completely
reorganized and given its present name. The
following year, the Club appeared on television
and attracted the attention of Armand and
Michaela Denis, who later became joint

 

71

Presidents—taking a great and active interest
in the work of the club.

Thanks to the interest and support of the
local schools and other youth services, a new
section of the club was opened in 1957. This
was the “Nature Wardens Service”—to which
any school or youth organization could become
afﬁliated. The Nature Wardens Service pro-
vides a useful “Information Bureau” answering
questions and problems concerning pets, wild-
life, and nature study, etc., sent in by pupils in
the schools or members of youth services.
Talks are provided for both school and clubs,
and courses in animal care prepared for youth
services having “Animal Lovers’ Badge Tests”,
etc. At the time of writing, there are now one
hundred and ﬁfty fully active and attending
members, more than three hundred Associate
members, and the club is in contact with about
ﬁfteen thousand children in the local schools.

With regard to the activities of the members,
these are divided into three main sections; class
work, practical animal care, and ﬁeld study.

There are three classes each week, held at our
headquarters (Hillbrook Road School, Upper
Tooting, London). On Wednesday evenings the
members study wild animals—species, structure,
distribution, habitat, feeding habits, etc., while
on Fridays, the correct care of pets is our main
concern. Monday evening is devoted to the
training of junior Leaders.

Practical animal care training is made
possible by the fact that the club is responsible
for the maintenance of a complete Pets Corner
in a hospital for mentally defective children, in
South London (the Fountain Ho‘spital). The
animals in this Pets Corner range from ducks
and budgerigars, to monkeys, pigs, goats, and
even snakes and lizards, so there is ample scope
for training. The members make two evening
attendances each week—plus Sunday mornings.

Regular rambles, ﬁeld study exercises, and
outings to places of general interest are organ-
ized at least once every month—and very well
attended. A summer camp is also held each year,
so as to provide the children with two weeks of

 

 

  




healthy exercise in such locations at the Lake
District and the mountains of Wales.

Dog training courses have proved to be a
popular feature, and many young owners have
learned to make their dogs obedient and better
pets as a result of a few weeks’ attendance on
one of the courses.

Each month during the winter (or, more
accurately, from September to April) a special
Saturday afternoon ﬁlm show or talk is arranged,
and tickets are sent out to the local schools. The
subjects covered by these meetings include “pets
and their care”, “dog training”, “British wild
animals”, “African wild-life”, and so on.

The club has its own ﬁlm unit however, and
this is completely run by three of the members.
The ﬁlm unit records the activities of the club
in general and covers such “features” as the
annual camp, etc.

An important point to record here is that
the members are taught to run their own club
to a great extent. The Committee members
are all under sixteen years of age, with the ex-
ception of the Treasurer and Secretary—both of
whom are seventeen. Members organize and run
their own canteen, some of the boys construct
cages or repair damaged ﬁxtures in the Pets
Corner, and organized teams of both girls and
boys attend Pets Corner every day to prepare
the various foods for all the animals—and then
carry out the feeding. All this goes on more or
less automatically throughout the year. Just
recently, a Library has been opened for use by
members, and here again, the two Librarians
are young members of the club.

To assist with the future development of the
activities, a Junior Leader Course was opened
last year (June 1960), and there are now
ﬁfteen potential leaders under training. These
youngsters have the opportunity of helping to
plan the club’s activities and to understand the
many problems involved in ﬁtting this busy
programme into the available working hours.
Some of these Leaders are already taking

special training in First Aid, and Animal First
Aid, others are studying map reading, obser-
vation hide building, wild-life photography, and
many other kindred subjects.

When, last year, I took on the task of replying
to letters sent to Armand and Michaela Denis
by school-children, I realized that here was an
opportunity of extending our Associate member?
ship, and so when answering questions sent in
by these children, I mention the fact that they
could become members of the club and make
use of the “Information Bureau” whenever they
wanted. This suggestion has already recruited
another two hundred Associate members from
all parts of the British Isles, and even Canada,
and so the club is gradually extending its range
and scope. In time it may play a really useful
part in this essential education of young people
in these important matters.

A most important development of our recent
activities, which might well be of interest to
readers in schools, is the Armand and Michaela
Denis Inter-Schools Animal Quiz Contest——
held for the ﬁrst time last year. The contest
takes place between May and July and is open
to any schools wishing to participate. There
are two “Leagues”; the Junior League is open
to children aged between nine and eleven
years (inclusive), and the Senior League—to
children aged between twelve and ﬁfteen years
(inclusive). The winning teams in both Leagues
are awarded the Armand Denis Shield (Senior),
or the Michaela Denis Shield (Junior), and hold
the trophy for one year.

Last year, thirty-two schools participated in
the Quiz, and Armand and Michaela Denis
presided at the Finals.

There is no doubt at all that children are
keen to learn about animals, the care of pets,
and study of wild-life, etc., and we have a
formidable waiting list of children between the
ages of eleven and ﬁfteen years who want to
join us as soon as the club can accommodate
them!

Dear Mrs. Stevens:
‘we have received your outline for the three page article (thO

'words) for the May issue of CHILDHOOD EDUCRTION. Your outline
is interesting and will be very informative to our readers.

 

It would seem that Section III, "History of Humane Education,"
would need to be very short or omitted. Sections IV and V of
the outline would also need to be brief. I am.wondering how

this can be done in a three page article. I see the teaching
of humane education as the greater portion of the article.

 
   
   
 
 

Should you have any photos from Which to choose (8"xlO" glossy
prints or clear snapshots) we would.be interested in using a
feW'of them.

 
   
 
  

 
 

I was extremely interested in the scope of your work and feel
humane education is a much needed field. It was thoughtful of
Mrs. west to arrange the luncheon and I enjoyed meeting you.

    
   
  

     

Sincerely) ”W7

The Purpose of the Association

The purpose of this organization is
to work for the education and well-
being of children by:

. promoting desirable conditions, pro-
grams and practices in the schools
— nursery through the elementary;

0 raising the standard of preparation
and encouraging continued pro-
fessional growth of teachers and
leaders in this ﬁeld;

0 bringing into active cooperation all
groups concerned with children in
the school, the home and the com-
munity;

o informing the public of the needs
of children and how the school
program must be adjusted to ﬁt
those needs.

A Brief History

The Association was formed by the
merging of two organizations, each foun-
ded to promote better educational Oppor-
tunities for young children. In 1930 the
International Kindergarten Union (or-
ganized 1892) adopted a new constitution
and the new name of Association for
Childhood Education. The following
year the National Council of Primary
Education (organized 1915) adopted the
constitution and name of the Associa-
tion. In 1946 the constitution was
amended to include the intermediate
level in the objectives and services of the
organization and to add International
to its name.

Eighty-five thousand persons
are members in 655 ACE

Branches

They receive, through their Branch
ofﬁcers, the ACEI Yearbook, bulletins
on education, ACE Manual and Ofﬁcers
Handbook and, each month of the
school year, CHILDHOOD EDUCA-
TION and ACEI Branch Exchange.
These 655 ACE Branches are located
in Canada, Korea, Sweden, Philippines
and the United States. Branch mem-
bers pay dues of $1 to the International
Association.

The 1959-1962 Plan of Action focuses
upon three areas related to the Associ-
ation’s concern for children. These are

1. Pressures in School and
Community

.I The Beginnings of Education

Balanced Educational
Programs for Children

Members identiﬁed the needs of chil-
dren which seemed to them to be the
most urgent and to demand action by
the Association for Childhood Educa-
tion International. Many needs were
cited; the three in this Plan were con-
sidered to be the most pressing by the

JUST BEING STILL can be tough for an energetic
dog, but this pooch seems to know it’s all for a
worthy cause. He’s serving as a model for San
Rafael High School students who are at work on
posters for the annual Humane Education Week

Schoolexhibit to be staged May 9 through H at
the E Street School in San Rafael under auspices
of the education committee of the Marin County
Humane Society. The student artists are, left to

They Speak ; or Our Animals

By DON KEOWN

The Marin County Humane
Society was founded back in
1.907 by Miss E. H. Tompkins
of San Anselmo.

As the moving spirit of the
society, one of her first acts
was to initiate, with. the as-
sistance of her sister, the late
Mrs. J. W. Carey, and. such.
educators as the late James
B. Davidson, a program of hu-
mane education within the
public schools.

MISS TOMPKINS personals
ly spoke on the need for kind-
ness and understanding of
animals to high. school stu-
dents.

Mrs. Carey delivered simi-1
lar talks before grammar
school children.

In 1913. Mrs. E. Floyd Jones
of Ross joined the two sisters
as the society’s “speakers bu-
reau.”

Through the years many
others have carried on such
work in the schools.

“With our boys and girls in
schools exposed to a well-
rounded, logical and pleasant
educational program. on hu-
manity, we need have no
fear,” the society believes.

The society continues to
emphasize the bringing of its
beliefs to the school children.
But another approach has
largely replaced. the old class-
room. talks.

NOW, ONCE a year, during
National Humane Education
Week—also Be Kind To Ani-
mals Week —- the society’s
educational committee spon-
sors an intensive competition
and exhibition of posters,
scrapbooks, essays, figurines
and photographs.

The event ends with a
showing of. the entries, open
to the public.

In recent weeks school
pupils throughout M a r in

have been hard at 't- on

says for this year’s spelt-
tion. The deadline to m‘ies
passed yesterday. tional
Humane Week begin unor-
row and will be erved
through next Saturd And
the high point of t arin
observance will be th nual
exhibition of the tents‘
posters, scrapbooks, 1, to
be held at San Ra 1’s E
Street School.

The exhibit will be en to

the public from 2 to 5 pm.
on Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday of. next week.

Last year the competition
attracted 209 posters, 57 cer-
amic and paper mache mod-
els. 20 scrapbooks, 16 essays
and 63 photographs.

The event has grown stead-
ily since it was inaugurated
in the 19205. As a result, the
exhibit once conducted in
various vacant stores was
moved in 1940 into the more

spacious auditorium of the E
Street School.

The photographic division
is ‘open to adults as well as
youngsters. Entries in the
other divisions are restricted
to school students.

This year special emphasis
has been placed on the essay
competition.

“The society believes that
nothing helps fix humane
ideals in children’s minds bet-
ter than setting such ideals
down in writing,” explains
Mrs. Doris Pollock of the edu-
cation committee.

The children are reminded
that legend has it that the
first composition ever written
by young Abraham Lincoln
dealt with the need for kind-
ness to animals.

0f the popular poster divi-
sion, Mrs. Pollock says: _

“An interest in nature
study and animal life is a part
of the subject matter in most
schools. Preparing humane
posters provides an opportun-
ity to integrate these and
other studies with a growing,
kindly attitude for all living
creatures.

“Sympathy and considera-
tion for them is aroused when
‘the children learn that mem-
bers of the animal kingdom
can suffer pain and distress
from neglect or acts of cruel-
ty-9D

Scrapbooks, too, provide
"another means to promote
the character building of the
child by an understanding of
universal kinship; to foster a
deeper understanding of and
sympathy with man’s rela-
tions —— the animals —— w h o
cannot speak for themselves.”

After the exhibit, the scrap-
books are turned over to ag-
encies which use them to en-
tertain, enlighten and cheer
ill and handicapped children.

COVER PHOTO

POSTERS shown on th e s e
pages as well as the one on
the cover of this issue of
y o u r Independent-Journal
Mar i n Magazine are the
work of Marin school stu-
dents. All were entered in
past years in the Humane
Education Week poster com-
petition and exhibition spon-
sored by the education com-
mittee of the Marin County
Humane Society. The friendly
pooch on the cover is the
work of Dixie Altermatt, who
graduated from Redwood
High School last year.

But the once-a—year compe-
tition and exhibition, it is felt,
serves to dramatize the cause
and stimulate interest in it
among the school pupils.

age their pupils to partici-
pate.

The humane society’s first
animal shelter was located in
a dilapidated blacksmith shop
on Third Street in San Ra-I
fael. The present building, at
402 Third Street, was dedi-
cated in June of 1951. Now,
the society feels, those quar—
ters have been outgrown.

A HUNT FOR 3 new shel-
ter site has been under way
for five years. If and when
one is found, not only the ani-
mals, but their good friends,
the boys and girls who care
about them, will be remem~
bered as well. For tentative
plans call for the construe.
tion of educational facilities

as part of the new animal

shelter building.

Then, the society believes,
it will be in a position to re»
cruit even more boys and girls
to the ranks of animal lovers.

4 UNION -— Teach our young-
sters why it’s wrong to twist a
cat’s tail and you may be well
on the way to developing a
compassionate society which

' under no conditions will condone

. the dropping of an A-bomb. This

' is the view of Fred Myers, ex-
ecutive director of the Humane

Society of the United States.

He told a panel of educators
and humane society officials
yesterday at Newark State Col-
lege that “a person who is cruel

to an animal is unconsciously

being cruel to himself or some
other human being.”

.He added, “Maybe in schools
we have failed to develop a
reverence for life. I’m troubled,
“‘"for, example, by a nutrition
project taught in many schools
in the country. A group of

mice is used in a pseudo-scien-
tific eXperiment. Some of the
mice are fed a balanced diet
and some are fed a poordiet.
As a result some of the animals
die. Here is a case where the
teacher is oblivious to the fact
that she is teaching a group of
children that what happens to
animals is unimportant.” -
MISS HELEN E. JONES, ex-
ecutive director of the National
Catholic Society for Animal
Welfare, Washington, indicated
“the failure of the humane
movement has been its inability
to reach all of society.” '
Sister M. Veronice, O.S.F.,
supervisor in parochial schools ,
and colleges in Washington, sug-
gested that workbooks be den

education.

However, Miss Leonora E.
Jersey Education Association
and vice principal of Union
High School, said, “You can’t
teach attitudes. Textbooks alone
won’t be the answer. We shall
still have some sadistic young-
sters despite our pleas.”

JAMES T. MEHORTER, Uni-
versity of Vermont psychologist
and a director of the Humane
Society of the United States,
said “Children learn through
identification, an unconscious
desire to emulate persons they
are close to such as parents or
teachers.” '

"Dr. Herbert E . Sizuorzo, a
teacher at Mount Vernon
School, and vice president of ,
the Newark Teachers Associa-

tion, condemned some school '

reading lists. “Some reading
lists emphasize books with the
theme ‘Kill or Be Killed.’ Is
this the thing we are trying to
teach our children?”

‘ All panelists agreed that the
problem of being kind to ani-

mals is just part of the problem '

of teaching humans to be kind
to each other. -

"Other panelists at the meet-
ing, which was sponsored by the
college and the New Jersey

s ‘\ fiigi ’. FALL NEWS LETTER‘

' Autumn, the seaSon of the year between

summer and winter. September let to
December let. Known in Canada as

the Fall.

This year, owing to the drought, the'
leaves have fallen in_dense clouds
to cover the earth before the snow
falls. ' An apt name "Fall".

With the wonderful weather it has
/ ‘ been possible to watch the squirrels
/ Gray Squirrel' ' making their busy preparations for
Sciurus Carolinensis)‘ ,_ the severe cold to come. They collect
twigs from oak, maple, chestnut,
hickOry and poplar and pack these
loosely in the crotch of a tree, usually at great height.
The nest 13 lines with dry leaves and serves as a shelter during'
the winter. In the Spring it is refurbished to serve as a
nursery. The gray squirrel chooses his mate in January or
February and the young are born forty-four days after mating.
They are not fully grown until they are two years old though
they often produce families before they are mature, in their
first year.. "

Gray squirrels have been known to live for from ten to
fifteen years, though in the age of the automobile and other
hazards, few reach this span.s

. When the pOpulation in any area becomes too large, mass
migration takes place. In pioneer days, groups of hundreds
joined together with other groups to become combined legions
of more than a hundred thousand strong. Possessing an
unswerving desire to travel in a straight line, they crossedi
mountains and rivers, often trying to swim roaring torrents.
.In eastern Connecticut in the Fall of 1933, groups of more
than a hundred were seen resting on the far bank of the river
whilst other similar batches were observed swimming strongly

across to join them.

, Our gray friends become quite tame in.their quest for
food, often entering through an open window of some benefactor.
'In one Canadian city,-some Roman Catholic Priests used to feed
_ the squirrels and, when it was near the time for food, the

'squirrels used to rattle the window to attract attention.

 




  

 

 
 

.-2-

One day one of the priests was going out on business
and just as he was crossing a very busy thoroughfare, he‘
noticed near him one Of his little squirrel friends, almost
paralysed with fright, being caught in the traffic. Before a
he could do anything, however; the squirrel, recognising a
friend, jumped up into the poCket of his cassock Where he rode
to the safety of the far sidewalk. Then, dismounting, he
scurried off into a garden, possibly to retrieve some hidden
treasure! * ‘ » ~ ,

 

, Unfortunately, the gray squirrel, which is so prolific

'and friendly to people, is also a killer and has greatly
reduced the numbers of its pretty and timid cousin the red
squirrel. It is estimated that the average populatiOn of red
squirrels is one to every four acres.

If yOu are an Animal Defender, then;
you should know how to look after your own
pet.1 If you have a cat then, whether
he has long or short hair, he will need
'grooming. Long or short haired, they
can be-groomed with a grooming glove.
- Long haired need daily combing to keep
? their fur free from mats. Ears and
eyes must be kept clean. A piece of
cotton batten soaked in mild boracic sol-
ution is excellent. ' Remember, use a
clean piece of cotton each time.
Variety in feeding.is essential to good
'health; if canned food is used do not

 

feed the same kind every day. , Do not
« “feed red tuna. Cats love it and will
refuse other foods if pandered to. This can be costly as

, this type of feeding can cauSe Steatitis Which can be fatal!

- 'Insects can be a seriOus trouble, especially in the Fall,
as your pet can pick them up in sand or grass. ' Use a good
'insect powder abOut every ten days. Make sure it has been
manufactured to be used fOr cats. Some poWders, suitable
for-dogs, can be injurious to cats. ' , . .

'Do not breed from your female cat..v It is wiser to have

_ her spayed. 'It is estimated that in the States 10,000 dogs

. and Cats are born every hour. In Canada, unwanted pets are
a big-problem too! ' ‘. l "‘ ' T" '

, A kitten is’a lovely gift but make sure it is_wanted...
This is very necessary at Christmas time.. Animals are.ggt
toys, they can not be-diScarded into the toy cupboard when not
wanted. They need love, food, comfort and regular attention.
If you are not prepared to look after an animal, PLEASE do

not accept one.

  




 

CARRVILIE: This club has now grown so
big that it has had to be divided into age
groups. They are a go ahead club. Their
first project was to entertain patients at
"The Raven“. Then they organised an Open
Meeting at Richmond hill from which they
gave the O. H E. S. $25. 00. They had a Corn
Roast, vis1 ted the Horticultural Society to
hear a lecture on Canadian Birds, visited
a Kennel and are now arranging a Pet Show.
All this plus their monthly meetings.

 

BRONTE: .Nowshave191.families interested in the club. This
club had a 'bus outing to Midhurst, took part in a Pet Show,
at which there were BOO pets and their student owners. They
are making bird Feeding Stations and have an Open Film Night
lined up for December.

COOKSVILLE & PORT CREDIT: We now have eight Animal Defenders
C1ubs in this d1 strict. They are the Muskrats, Pawns,
Porcupines, Rubins, Prairie Dogs, Wolverines, Deer and Credit
Gulls. All small groups but not small in ideas. They
visited the Pet Show and won prizes in Oakville. In summer
they visited Rainbow Ranch and on 15th November they are
combining for an Open Film Night.

 

WOODBRIDCE AND PINE GROVE: The Weedbridge A.D.C. has had

two meetings this season and plan their third on November 4th.
They are planning a second Open Film Evening and some of their
members hope to attend the Pet Show at RichmoaiHill on Saturday,
2nd November.

Pinegroove has had difficulty in getting the use of a hall but
hope this trouble will be overcome soon.

 

 

MIDLAND: The Regent A.D.C. is going ahead. To help the
Senior Auxiliary of the Ontario Humane the Regent A.D.C. is
selling Hasti Notes. Led by Mrs. Bryson McQuirter and assisted
by Mrs. R. Bell the club is bound to be successful.

WHITBY: A welcome is extended to our new junior club which is
taking the name Paradise A. D. C. The leader, Miss Meeker, is a
dedicated teacher and we wish her every success.

CANARIES AND BUDGERIGARS.

Canaries and budgerigars make

 

 

excellent pets, especially for
peeple with little space or in
apartments.

If you decide to get one, you

must make sure that you will be
*entirely responsible for it. Do
not forget that a bird in a cage is
completely dependent upon you and
you must care for its cleanliness,
food and drink at all times.

One of the most important things is

to see that your bird has clean

water every day, fresh seed at least
every other day, and other requirements
for its health. ‘

 

 

The cage should be cleaned out at least once a week and, at
this time, the perches and food utensils should be thoroughly
cleansed. Perches should be dropped into scalding water and
,the crevices of the cage itself given the scalding water
treatment to eradicate mites and carriers of disease._’

Remember that birds have no teeth and it is up to you to

supply the necessary grit which it uses in its gizzard to

grind up the food. Always buy the best type of grit. A
dusty kind is not suitable. Grit serves two purposes: the
flint type is used for mastication and the limestone is a
source of calcium essential for hone feeding. This limestone
grit is dissolved by the acids.in the bird's body and the
calcium is extracted. Another source of calcium is from

fresh green food. This should be offered to birds at all
times. A tender piece of cauliflower or cabbage leaf, a small
piece of fresh lettuce, dandelion leaf, celery, chicory and
nasturtium. The birds will appreciate the seed from plantains,
dandelions (before they get to the clock stage), shepherd's-
purse and the flowers of calendulas (marigolds), nasturtiums
and dandelions when freshly in flower. These flowers are
excellent for feeding when the birds are coming into new
feather and some breeders use these as they think it improves
the colour, especially of canaries. .

One point of warning over the use of green food and

flowers is that they shauld He3rash and, if picked by the
wayside, or arywiere where the spraying of plants or trees
takes place, they shoqu be thoroughly washed and the water
shaken from them before putting them into the cage.

There are all kinds of preparations made up in paCkets for
their feeding and some Pet Stores have loose seed. Again,
one should take care to buy the best. It is cheapest in
the end. 'Seed mixtures should have clean looking plump
seeds and no dust and remember to throw away the old seed‘
every other day. This old seed need not be wasted. It
can be collected in a box and used for the feeding of wild
“birds during our severe winter months. Millet seed is a
"pick me up" and linseed is beneficial given in small
quantities during the winter.

A caged bird cannot wear its claws down. It will sharpen
its beak on a piece of cuttlefish bone, which should always
be attached to the side of the cage, but from time to time it
may be necessary to clip the claws. This is ~ ..
quite easily done if you have made a friend of

your bird and he has become tame. He should

be held firmly in your hand, but not crushed, '

and with the foot extended to the light, so that you can see
the blood vein, clip the end of the claw completely off with
a good pair of nail clippers, remembering always to watch
that your out comes well below the end of the blood vein.

Birds go to bed at dusk and arise at dawn. You should remember
this and make a cover for the cage so that your pet may sleep
at night when you have your electric lights on.

A cage bath should be attached at the sliding deor panel,
several times a week; most birds enjoy this.

Ailments: Prevention is always better than cure and a good
healthy bird given the attention previously described, should
remain healthy. If you are in doubt about your bird, you
should take him to the nearest veterinarian. However, one
of the main things to remember is that birds in cages should
.be protected from sudden changes in temperature. They
should never be in a draught, summer or winter, and in the
summer it is very bad to have them exposed to direct sunlight
during the heat of the day. lhis does not mean that your
bird must be kept away from fresh air which is beneficial

to them.

When buying your pet go to a reputable dealer who will
guarantc e that your pet is a newly born bird of the season.

A very good time to buy is in the late Fall when the birds

are just maturing into their first year. This is so import-
ant because sharp operators are up to all the tricks of making
old birds look young and foisting them on to the public.

’ONTARIO HUMANE EDUCATION SOCIETY

OAKVILLE, ONTARIO WPET MERE.

An oblong cage, similar to a
rabbit hutch in design, may be used for
mice. It should have plenty of room,
about 18" long, 8-12” front to hack,
and 8—12" high. This will house three
mice and ladders and swings can be put

_ in to give them exercise. A Zinc or
tin floor is a must as, however care-
ful you are with mice, there is a

"mousey" odour.

Sawdust is the best litter, but mice like some hay
and use it for nesting. The sawdust should be changed
frequently, and once every two weeks the whole cage should
be scalded out with water to which a little disinfectant
has been added.

Breeding:

If you have a breeding pair, a smaller box should
be put into the cage. This should have a 2" hole on one
wall, in which the mother mouse can have her family in
seclusion. A little cotton batting is helpful to her
at this time and with it should line her nest. Never
disturb the nest to look at the babies until they show
themselves outside, or the mother may kill them.

Two meals a day are needed, morning and evening,
and every mouse needs a tablespoon of oats — coarse
oatmeal - canary seed, or a mixture of these. Sometimes
the evening meal can be a little bread and milk. During
the day, there should be green food, dandelion, lettuce,
groundsell, shepherd's purse, watercress, or a piece of
carrot or apple.

Handling:

A mouse should be tame and easy to handle. The more
you take him out of his cage and stroke him with your hand
the better. Pick him up by the root of his tail and put
him on your hand at once. He should be quite content to
sit there. Stroke him with your finger or a piece of silk
for grooming.

Control:

Make sure that your mouse cannot escape. Some folks
get quite upset if a mouse is running around. Also, if he
escapes, he may have a bad time when he meets wild mice
running around; he can pick up disease and spread it amongst
other tame mice.

CARE OF RABBITS.

Rabbits make the most interest~
ing pets, contrary to the old
saying "rabbits' brains". The
peOple who study these creatures
find they are very intelligent,
although nervous, animals.

There are many breeds, long
fur and short. The rex rabbit
is the result of what is known
as a mutation. In the last
thirty years most breeds have
been rexed by careful breeding
and selection.

Before we buy our rabbits, we
must arrange for the housing.
In Canada the hutch or tiered
hutch is the best proposition.
Morant hutches, (movable pens on
grass) are only suitable in the
summer months.

Rabbits need plenty of room and an individual hutch should be

at least 3 ft. wide and 2 ft. front to back, and 18 inches to

2 ft. floor to ceiling. Wood or asbestos may be used, but

if asbestos is used care should be taken that there is sufficient
depth. In the winter, the breath condenses on the ceiling in
an asbestos hutch and, if the rabbits ears can touch the ceiling
when temperatures are low, serious injury can be caused by
frostbite. The roof should slope to carry off rain and snow.
Rabbits can put up with cold but not damp.

Litter: This may be straw, leaves or sawdust. - Sawdust being
absorbent is the most hygienic and if the corner is cleared out
each day the rabbit will be clean and the thorough cleaning can
be done once a week.

The cleanings can be put in a pile and watered with
permanganate of potash, covered with soil, and they will rot
to make a valuable nitrogenous manure for the garden.

Breed: There are so many different breeds that it would be
wise to go to a show and see which breed you prefer.

Feeding: Rabbits need body building foods, bulk, and something
to grind down their teeth on. Bran mash or pellets may be

 




-2-

fed in the morning with green food, roots and an ample

supply of hay at night. Branches of deciduous trees, ash,
hawthorne, raspberry canes, apply, pear, etc., are all good
for the teeth, but these should be washed in case they have
been sprayed with insecticide. Some of these sprays can be
fatal. Keep the feeding and water bowl cleansed,at least once
each week they should be scalded.

In the summer, all sorts of mixed greens from the
garden may be used to advantage and it is best to give a
mixture rather than a lot of one particular plant. Amongst
those which are the most beneficial are: sow thistle, dande—
lion, plantains, shepherd's purse, comfrey, lettuce (in small
quantities) cabbage and cauliflower, carrot tOps, celery tops
and turnips.

water: Always keep water in the hutch; fix it to the side

so that it does not get tipped over. It is essential that

doe rabbits have water, especially when they kindle (have their
young). Lack of water at this time often results in mutilation
of the babies and the general health of the rabbits calls for

water.

Handling: Never lift a rabbit by its
ears, this is cruel. Balance with
the ears but take the weight of the
rabbit in the other hand by slipping
your hand under the rump. Learn to
handle the rabbit gently, then it
will come to trust you. This is
most important, then, if your rabbit
becomes ill it is easy to "doctor" it.

A doe rabbit can be bred
from 6-8 months according to breed.
The larger breeds need longer to
develop. Three litters can be bred
during the year if you have the
facilities and know who will adopt
the young. Five to seven only
should be kept by the mother. This
can be a problem and so, if you do
want a rabbit just as a pet, keep a
buck.

Whatever you do decide to do, keep the rules, care
for and be kind, and you will learn a lot and have lots of
pleasure in doing so. Remember, a rabbit in a hutch cannot
fend for itself. You must feed, water and clean at regular
times. If you are not prepared to do this, then you should
never keep a rabbit or any caged animal.

 




CARE OF GUINEA PIGS - CAVIES

It is usual to keep three guinea pigs together,
a male and two females. A suitable home for these
would be a strong box 2% ft. wide, 18" deep and 18"
from floor to ceiling, with a strong door of %" wire
netting. It is a good idea to put a shelf at the
back which they enjoy resting on.

Guinea pigs need a mash, bread and milk, or
pellet meal in the morning, with mixed green food
at mid-day, i.e., groundsel, plantain, water cress,
carrot tops, and roots, parsley, dandelions, chicory,
celery, chickweed, broccoli, cauliflower and apples.
At night they enjoy hay. This should be put in a
rack or tied in a bundle and fixed up off the floor.

Feeding dishes must be kept clean and a good
supply of clean water must always be available. Guinea
pigs are very thirsty creatures and without access to
clean water, they will lose their appetite and die.

As soon as it is known that a female is in young,

she must be put in a hutch by herself, and provided with
soft hay or similar material with which to make her nest.
Babies start to move around on their own in three days,
but must remain with their mother for at least a month.

Always feed good wholesome food to animals, good
food and attention to their cleanliness will do much
to keep them healthy.

Remember there is one more important thing -
KINDNESS! Kindness to animals is rewarding.

GOLDEN HAMSTERS.

 

Hamsters are not mice or rats.
They are rodents, like squirrels, rats
and guinea pigs, but they are not
related to rats or mice in any way.
They were discovered in Aleppo in Syria
in 1930 and descendants were taken to
England in 1931.

The life span is short, usually
two years, although there are exceptions
to this. They gnaw and bite all the
time so metal cages must be used.
Sawdust makes a good litter.

Small bits of dog biscuit, corn, peanuts, carrots and an
occasional apple form their main food. It is interesting
to see them storing their food in their cheek pouches.

Water should be available and they like milk which is good
for them and can be given every day.

Some people put a wheel in the cage and the hamster
loves to turn on this.

Cleanliness:

 

As with all pets, cleanliness is important and a
necessary part of good husbandry. The hutch should be
cleaned daily and thoroughly once a week. The temperature
in which they are kept should never drOp below 56 degrees F.

Breeding:

Hamsters may be bred from at 3% months, breeding at too
early an age will produce weak and small youngsters. Three
litters a year are the most that should be bred. Gestation
time is 16 days and the babies should be weaned at 28 days,
and separated into sexes at four weeks.

When hamsters have large litters, the owners sometimes
feel it is wise to reduce the number. Drowning should
never be resorted to. No animal should be drowned, but with
hamsters this practice is particularly cruel. If a hamster
finds himself in water, he fills his cheek pouches with air
and keeps himself afloat until he dies from sheer exhaustion.

Sexing hamsters:

Hamsters/

 




-2-

Hamsters can be sexed very easily, even when they
are very young, if you remember one rule; the male organs
are a distance apart while the female's are close together.

Handling hamsters:

Since they have been bred in captivity for many years,
hamsters do not usually bite. However, to pick up a
hamster ~ place your hand over the back and lift with the
head facing your wrist. Do not place your hand underneath
the animal or poke your finger through the netting of the
pens. Hamsters are short sighted and they may think your
finger is food. The more you handle the hamsters, the
tamer they become.

When buying a hamster only purchase one which has a clean
coat and has no pimple or sore. Hamsters sometimes get a
skin disease which is very difficult to treat and can be
passed on to other hamsters.

Keep your pet warm, clean and give only wholesome food.
If you notice that he is not well you would be well advised
to consult your veterinarian.

SVE Picture-Story Study Prints are big in size, (18”x13”), printed
with the newest true-color permanent inks to reproduce nature’s
colors in all their brilliance and beauty. Each picture is printed on
extra-strength stock and then coated with a protective finish that

resists wear, scratching and marring. All four corners of the Study

Prints are rounded to prevent “dog-earing,” even with frequent
handling. Small die-punched holes in corners permit posting on
bulletin board or elsewhere without damaging the print.

Photography that “can best speak for itself"

Typical of the photographers who produced the magnificent pictures for these
Study Prints is Torkel Korling, who photographed the Spring Wild Flowers set.
“Glory by the Wayside,” an R. R. Donnelley book, comments in part on Mr. Korling’s
work as follows: “Torkel Korling has combined the perceptions of the artist with a
superb mastery of the camera to confront us with something delightfully new under
the sun . . . He reveals to us the wonders of color, texture, configuration, better—
and, to use a bold figure of speech—the character, the personality and the poetic

loveliness of flowering plants . . . Even if qualified to do so, We should prefer not to
expound the unique art of these pictures; for, of all photography 0* this kind we have
seen, this can best speak for itself."

Because of the paper stock and high speed relDrOleCtion necessarily USGd in
this brochure, the full-size reproduction on the inside page Cannot fully convey the
true beauty and brilliance of these prints—each the work of a photographer-artist
of Mr. Korling’s caliber.

There is no limit to the versatility of
Picture-Story Study Prints

USE TH EM TO:

INTRODUCE A STUDY UNIT A display of the prints prior to the start of a
study unit will arouse class interest and anticipation.

STRENGTHEN BASIC UNITS May be usedwith Science and/or Social Study
programs as basic material for lesson presentation.

SUPPLEMENT UNIT ACTIVITIES Ideal for use as a complementary activity
for special reinforcement or for review and testing.

INSTRUCT SMALL DISCUSSION . GROUPS A teacher may use the Study
Prints with small groups of students to develop individual ideas, enlarge
concepts and stimulate analytical thinking.

ENCOURAGE SPECIAL PROJECTS A Study Print can encourage an
enthusiastic youngster to do independent research on a selected subject. Students
may be asked to compare the pictures with actual specimens or with pictures in
reference and textbooks. The Prints can also motivate students to make picture
collections or, where feasible, to collect specimens.

STIMULATE INDIVIDUAL LEARNING A library of Study Prints, permitting
leisure browsing by pupils, can provide a meaningful learning activity. Both slow
learners and superior students can profit from this opportunity for enrichment
because each individual. can work independently, in his own way and at his

own speed.

CREATE A CLASSROOM DISPLAY Displayed on a bulletin board, chalkboard
or activity corner in the classroom, Picture- Story Study Prints can create an
atmosphere of learning and provide a colorful picture laboratory of nature
specimens authentically depicted in natural habitat.

COORDINATE WITH OTHER STUDIES Study Prints may be used

to introduce a filmstrip or motion picture, story, song or poem. Art classes
studying art in nature will find them extremely helpful. Students may be encouraged
to write or tell a story about'the subject pictured. Nature or Science Clubs

may use the prints in programs or special displays.

DEVELOP OBSERVATION, SELF-EXPRESSION Display Study Prints

on a chalkboard or chart rack and have small groups or entire class study each print.
Careful viewing of the pictures will help students develop their powers of
observation, while their accounts of what they see will give them

valuable experience in self-expression.

ENRICH A SHOW— AND- TELL SESSION The teacher may show the Study
Prints, one at a time, and read the description on the back. Or, prints can be
distributed among students who take turns “showing and telling.”

Schools Getting Booklet
On Kindness To Animals

A 102-page booklet called “Teacher’s Guide to Humane
Education” is being distributed this week, Kindness to
Animals Week, to 2,000 teachers in City schools.

The booklet, published by the Louisville Board of Educa-
tion and the Junior Humane Education Society of Kentucky,
is 'filled with poems about animals and with educational proj
e‘cts stressing “desirable attitudes” toward animals. .1

The booklet was partially financed by W A. Meglemry in
memory of his daughter, Miss Ruth Meglemry, one of tne first
teachers to work with junior humane groups and their prede-
cessors, the Bands of Mercy.

Art work for the booklet was done by students at DuValle,
Highland, Manly, and Southern junior high schools. .

Mrs. E. L Henderson, president of the Junior Humane
Education Society of Kentucky, will give a supper at 5 pm
Sunday at her home, 87 Valley Road. It will honor Mrs. Ad a
O Sillings, a general supervisor in City schools, and 30 teach

ers who work with junior humane groups . s...

THE MILWAUKEE JOURNAL

SCIENCE THROUGH OUTDOOR EDUCATION

JULIAN W. SMITH

Director, Outdoor Education Project of the American

Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation

and Associate Professor, College of Education, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan

Two of the most important ingredients in the learning
process are inherent in the use of the outdoor laboratory for
elementary school science: (1) eager and enthusiastic learn-
ers; and (2) a rich learning environment. Elementary age
children, inquisitive and adventuresome, respond to the out-
doors as ducks do to water. Outdoor settings with real and
living things are conducive to learning because all of the
senses can be used in the process.

Education in and for the outdoors, often termed outdoor
education, has great potential for teaching elementary school
science. Outdoor laboratories which can be used to enrich
classroom experiences are within reach of most schools.
They are often on the school site just outside the building or

a stone’s throw from neighborhood parks, vacant lots, or
farm lands. Some school districts have been farsighted in
acquiring properties with natural laboratories already avail-
able or upon which they can be established. Others use
available community facilities such as parks, camps, and
outdoor areas. Park schools constitute an ideal arrangement
for outdoor science with the buildings adjacent to park areas.
In some of the newer elementary schools, the classroom
doors open directly on the park area.

A good arrangement is to have an outdoor area nearby
so that children and teachers may move in and out, using
the classroom, the library, and the outdoor laboratory, wher-
ever the environment is most conducive to learning.

 

 

 

 

 




Most teachers would agree that many of the learnings in
science could be made more real and meaningful through
the use of the outdoors. Field trips, excursions, and more
extended periods in a school camp are familiar patterns for
making use of the outdoors for teaching science and other
curriculum activities. The major deterrent to the use of the
outdoors seems to be administrative inﬂexibility in getting
outside the four walls and the lack of experience and train-
ing in outdoor education by teachers. Both of these handi-
caps can be overcome through careful planning and in-service
education. Upwards of 800 school districts in the United
States use camps for week-long experiences for elementary
classroom groups. Thousands more utilize school sites,
school forests, farms and gardens, and other community
sites for outdoor education.

Available Resources

A good beginning is to inventory the available resources
in the community and identify classroom experiences which
can be enhanced through their use. In some schools an out-
door education committee is appointed to initiate a compre-
hensive outdo-or education program that includes science.
Many of the things that “people live by” are related to the
outdoors, such as the change of seasons, weather, birds,
plants and animals, food, clothing, and shelter. Utilization
of the natural interests of children in observing, collecting,
hiking, camping, and other outdoor interests is often a good
point of departure for use of the outdoors by classroom
groups. Too often the real, and live topics are made need-
lessly abstract by conﬁning teaching entirely to textbooks,
pickled and stuffed specimens of birds and animals, and
lectures when there is an abundance of living things in the
area about the school. .

Science in outdoor education can be initiated easily. Be-
ginnings may consist of “learning and hearing” walks supple—
mented by class and individual projects. Some schools con-
duct all-day activities on the school site combining nature
activities and explorations with cookouts, outdo-or crafts,
and outdoor sports. Such events, planned by children and
teachers, involve the use of science materials, textbooks, and
ﬁeld guides in preparation for the outdoor experiences. One
effective procedure is for a class to develop outlines that
suggest the things to see and investigate. The Whitﬁeld
Elementary School, Pontiac, Michigan, in preparation for a
week in camp during the winter prepared research units on
water, soil, wildlife, plants, and weather. (Many of these
activities can be used at other times of the school year.)
Some of the questions and projects included:

Suggested Activities

Observe drops of water from various places under a
microscope. Identify microscopic organisms.

Why does the ground freeze? How deep is it frozen?
Where did you test it, and what was the temperature of
the air?

Collect several kinds of soil. Put them in a jar of water,
then shake and observe settling. (Consult a resource person
to ﬁnd out what this means.)

What are some necessary game laws? Why?

Why do teeth and eye placement differ in animals? What
is comparable in ﬁsh? How do bird beaks differ? Why?

Build and supply a bird feeding station.

Make casts of tracks.

How can you tell the— age of a cut tree? An uncut tree?

Collect leave-s, twigs, weeds, fruits, fungi, galls, insect
eggs, cocoons, etc., for identiﬁcation and display.

Make some winter bouquets.

Read weather instruments in our weather station.

Keep a record of weather for the week, using the barom-

and thermometer. Observe cloud formations. Forecast.

Some of the many suggested activities and projects con-
tained in a booklet entitled Outdoor Education * include:

Making charts for identiﬁcation of trees, ﬂowers, birds.

Collecting and mounting seeds, insects.

Leaf study by means of blueprints, potato prints, spatter
prints, crayon, clay.

Finding animal homes.

Building a terrarium or aquarium.

Listening to night sounds.

Walking up gullies, studying rocks, soil, effects of erosion.

Keeping ﬁeld notes of observations on a locale before
and after rain.

While there may be little doubt about the value of out-
door experiences in teaching science after witnessing the
interest and enthusiasm of the learners, simple evaluation
procedures should prove helpful in developing a program.
One effective way is to note new interests in science as evi-
denced by collections, projects, written materials and note-
books. A number of schools, such as Long Beach, Cali—
fornia, have used a survey of children’s interests following
a week’s experience in a school camp.** Parent reactions
have also been sampled and in most instances there has been
complete support for outdoor education programs.

What is currently known about learning indicates that
direct experiences in the out-of—doors will vitalize classroom
procedures and help obtain many of the classroom objec-
tives. Not only does the use of the outdoor laboratory con-
tribute to a better knowledge of science, but it helps develop
appreciations of the natural environment and creates interest
in wholesome outdoor pursuits.

PRIMARY LEVEL OUTDOOR EDUCATION

 

A third grade class enters
the school district's outdoor
education site.

IRWIN ENGEL
Consultant in Outdoor Education and School Camping, Seely Place School, Scarsdale, New York

Outdoor education has been an active part of the cur-
riculum in our school district since September 1952. This is
an ongoing program, available in all subject areas, at all
grade levels, for p-art or all of any school day. Teachers
and their classes participate in the program with the aid of
the outdoor education consultant who plans each particular
outdoor experience along the academic lines suggested by
the teacher. The outdoor education program is directly
related to classroom work.

Seasonal changes make up a good part of the science unit
in our primary grades and, where could children learn best
about seasonal changes? In a series of four trips to the dis—
trict’s wooded outdoor education site, our children discover
the seasonal changes that take place in summer, fall, winter,
and spring. On the ﬁrst seasonal trip, generally early Septem-
ber to study “Signs of Fall,” the class members are taught to
use their senses of sight, hearing, feeling, tasting, and smelling
to determine the season.

' By the time spring comes pupils are quite adept at “see-
ing” changes in the trees, leaf buds, and young leaves. They
hear” Spring when they are all asked to close their eyes
and each pupil reports on what he has heard. Many children

anary grade pupils are adept at gathering the

twigs from the “forest ﬂoor” and building a brush pile. They
can readily understand that they are making the “forest
ﬂoor” more attractive and helping provide shelter for small
game. Older elementary grade pupils are intrigued by work-
ing with compass and tap-e measure to map our trails and
then transform their calculations into scale maps.

A School Pond

These mapping exercises came alive for the pupils. Their
work helped decide where it would be best to dam up a stream
and create a permanent pond in our outdoor education area.

Constructing this pond was an all school project. The
pupils’ map and plans were submitted to our Board of Edu-
cation for approval. Upper elementary classes felled and
hauled trees for the wall of the dam. (A knowledge of for-
estry and simple machines helped them with this project.)
Middle and primary grades, on their trips, dug earth and
carried rocks and stones for the body of the dam. At the
end of the school year the dam held, created a pond “more
than four times as big as our classroom” and water began
to ﬂow over our spillway.

Since the completion of this pond it takes constant care
on the part of pupils to eliminate erosion by transplanting
and by shoveling. We have seen a pair of mallard ducks
nest and hatch their eggs at our site. Pupils have found p051-
tive evidence of the presence of a pileated woodpeckel‘ at
the pond. Junior and senior high school students now have
an area for pond study to complement their microscoplc WOfk-

CAPSULE
OF
EARTH HISTORY

JOHN A. HOWE

Coordinator of Planetarium Programs and Guide Service
University of Nebraska State Museum, Lincoln, Nebraska

(Many outdoor education experiences center around the study
of geology, rocks and minerals. The material presented in
this article is intended to help the teacher present the proper
perspective of the age of the earth in terms the children
understand while studying geology in the ﬁeld.)

The earth is very old and its history is quite complex, but
the basic ideas can be presented in a simple manner. One of
the greatest difﬁculties in presenting the proper perspective
lies in the fact that whenever we present ideas on prehistoric
time, we get bogged down with numbers. We tell of things
that happened so many millions or billions of years ago.
This approach is impressive but it projects us outside the
realm of human experience for there are very few people
who have a good concept of just what a million of anything
is. In order to circumvent this difﬁculty, let us use our imag-
ination a little and telescope the 4 billion years of the earth’s
existence into one year, and further imagine that it is now
midnight of December 31 and we are reviewing the year.

4

Now we can talk about the time intervals and the student

  

will have some basis for comparison.

There is very little that can be said about the ﬁrst nine
months of our year, for we know very little about the ﬁrst
three—fourths of the history of the earth. Things happened__
mountains were formed and worn away, especially in eastern
Canada, but no fossils were preserved. It is difﬁcult to date
the past if no fossils were formed. Many people think that
life was present, but those early forms did not possess hard
parts and were not preserved. These conditions prevailed
from the ﬁrst of January until the last of September, or from
soon after the beginning of winter through spring and sum-
mer. This leaves fall for our consideration.

Plants with hard parts began to appear about the ﬁrst of
October but these were still very simple forms, such as algae,
and fossils in rocks of this age were rarely formed. The
earth also experienced so-me very cold weather at this time
and one of the early ice ages occurred with glaciers moving
across the land. During the last part of October, great moun-
tain ranges formed in what is now the Great Lakes and the
Grand Canyon regions. We could refer to these ﬁrst two
periods of earth history which extended from the ﬁrst of
January till late October, as the “dark ages,” for very little
is known about them.

Most of our detailed knowledge about the earth concerns
only November and December. It was early in November
that a structural revolution which began earlier was progress-
ing rapidly among the inhabitants of the earth; many forms
were developing hard parts. Shelled animals became quite
common in the seas and fossils were numerous for the ﬁrst
time. Invertebrates (animals without backbones) dominated
the ancient seas for the ﬁrst two weeks of November. They
had a large area available to them, for during the second
week of November fully half the North American continent
was covered by shallow seas. This is the greatest inundation
of the continent known to the earth scientists. The only dry
land in North America at the time consisted of several large
islands. The rule of the invertebrates under such conditions
was comparatively long, but the ﬁshes were developing rap-
idly and ﬁnally took over. The ﬁrst amphibians appeared
about Thanksgiving Day, but this group was never destined
to rule the earth as some of the other groups did. The liz-
ards followed close on the heels of the amphibians during
the ﬁrst week in December and soon dominated the scene.
These were the ancestors to the dinosaurs.

At this time, great changes again began to take place
in the crust of the earth. A restless area along the eastern
coastline of North America began to move. This area
ﬁnally formed into the Appalachian Mountains. At about
the same time, another ice age developed. Many animals
perished but a few carried on. The development of the
lizards was rapid until, during the second week in De—
cember, some of the largest animals that ever lived were
walking the face of the earth. These were the dinosaurs.
First came the giants that shook the ground when they
walked. These died, to be followed by smaller bizarre forms
with crests and horns. During the time of the giants, the birds
began their conquest of the air and a small group of animals
looking alarmingly like rats and mice began their slow
development. These small animals, although they possessed
hair and large brains, were no match for the great dinosaurs,
so the mammals waited their time in hiding. The big break

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 




 

 

  

for the mammals came the second week in December when
the Rocky Mountains began to loom in the west and the
sub—tropical climate of North America began to take on a
seasonal aspect, for it was during this time that the dinosaurs
became extinct.

Although we hear much about the dinosaurs, the time
that they stalked the earth constitutes a little under one
week of our year. With the passing of the dinosaurs, there
was nothing to stop the mammals, and they began to develop
rapidly. The modern mammals with their large brains made

their entrance about Christmas Day and have ruled the
world ever since. One inhabitant of our modern earth is
still missing. Although we have almost come to the end
of our year, man has not yet appeared on the scene. Man
ﬁnally did arrive on December 31 at 11:59 pm, so as
you can see, our tenure on earth has been very short. Our
year ends with the formation of the Coast Ranges along the
west coast. Written history is an inﬁnitesimally short period
of time on this scale, for Columbus would have discovered
the New World just 1/200 of a second ago.

Many times our approach to a learning situation is stereo-
typed and consequently the interest of the students is not
always what we might desire. A useful opening to the
study of water can be made by using the following question-
naire without any introduction and with no questions allowed
until each student has made his judgments on the form.

Imagine that you are on an afternoon walk through a
small ___________________________________________ _ (fill in the region you want,
New England, etc.) town. This is the ﬁrst time that you
have been in the area and although normally you would
bring along a canteen of water when hiking, this particular
day you forgot to ﬁll it before leaving. The route you are
taking through the town does not pass by any houses and
you are quite thirsty.

Sources of Water

Below are listed sources of water. Please indicate by
a check mark which one you would use to ﬁll your canteen.
Notice that the introductory statement in the question-
naire states with certainty that the water sources are foreign
to the students and it is clear that the only consequence to

avoiding the water entirely is temporary discomfort. (For
various parts of the country changes in the opening statement
should be made to ﬁt local conditions.)

The author was amazed at the responses given by his
classes and the reasons that the students used to justify
their choices. It made for animated class discussion and
awakened an interest in what might have been a rather
dull unit. The approach was worthwhile for it motivated
the students to gain an understanding of an extremely im—
portant concept in living.

This method of introducing the subject is in itself useful,
but if sufﬁcient interest is aroused it is possible to utilize
the results for an introduction to statistics and graphing if
appropriate. A class or individual might enjoy following
up the study by ﬁnding out if responses differ in urban,
suburban, and/ or rural districts. The answers of various
grade levels within a school itself might be worthy of study
by a curious student.

(In the event that the survey approach described here is
useful to you in your classes, the author would appreciate
a summary of the results with comment.)

Science education is undergoing a period of transforma-
tion. This is due largely to the identiﬁcation of new concepts
in the structure of the disciplines of science, research in
learning theory, investigations into the nature of creativity,
and examination of the teaching process. All of these contri-
butions are helping to make science instruction more con-
sistent with scientiﬁc methods of inquiry.

Basic to these endeavors is an attitude which permeates
the spirit of inquiry, is inherent in creativity, and is pre—
requisite to discovery. This attitude might be called apprecia-
tion. It implies that the learner becomes not only mentally
involved but also enraptured with the phenomena, principles,
and characteristics he encounters in his environment. “In
order that the brain may comprehend, the heart must ﬁrst
listen.”

Appreciation, then, is the sensitive beginning of scientiﬁc
investigation leading to an understanding of our environ-
ment. Within this attitude germinates the skills-of observing,
investigating, and questioning which are the bases for further
scientiﬁc activity. Appreciation is the key to sustaining mo—
tivation, interest, and enthusiasm in the young child. ‘We

must ﬁrst become aware of our environment to explain it,
to use it wisely, and to solve the problems of adjusting to it.
But with the addition of appreciation, science turns from a
passive recognition to a tenacious quest.

Time to Reﬂect

Children need many opportunities to commune with the
world around them. Time in the day needs to be allowed for
children to reﬂect on the changing formations of a cloud,
to become charmed by the opening of a bud and to sense the
lean, logical simplicity of mathematical order.

This attitude, however, is not taught in speciﬁc lesson
plans. Steps for itsdevelopment are not written in any
book of methods. This attitude is gleaned, derived, and
absorbed by children out of the association and interaction
with others who exhibit this as a value.

Thus our children need to come in contact with teachers
who; ﬁnd beauty in a sunset, intrigue in the geometries of
a spider web, thrill to the iridescence of a hummingbird’s
wing, commune with the serenity of a distant constellation,
see the congruity and intricacies in the derivation of a
mathematical formula, recognize the orderliness and admit—
ness of a chemical change. Teachers generate in children an
awareness of the world around them. The teacher is the
underlying inspiration for a child to become an ardent ob-
server and an insatiable questioner. This person develops in
others a compassionate attitude toward his environment
and a curiosity with which he goes wondering through life.

Developing Attitudes

We need to observe, discover, and nurture these qualities
in children. Those who are developing an attitude of
appreciation will begin to demonstrate behaviors mani-
festing such an intangible value. Students will demonstrate
excitement toward science as they advance to higher grade
levels. Their curiosity will become stronger as the problems
they encounter become more complicated. Their environment
will attract their attention and their inquiry as their senses
capture the rhythm, the patterns, the shapes, the colors, and
the harmony of the universe. Then, after a period of
inspiration comes the phase of execution, for as children
explore, investigate, and observe, their natural curiosity leads
them to ask what, how, and why.

Students need help to develop an awareness about the

power of the forces affecting the universe, the vastness of

space, the magnitude of time, and the dynamics of change.
They will tend to display a cognizant and compassionate
behavior toward other forms of life as they understand the
need for protecting their environment, for respecting the role
and value of living things, and for perceiving the delicate
worth of individuality and variation. Appreciation, then,
becomes a basis for the understanding of the acute balance
in which man, plant, and other animals survive and progress
harmoniously with the forces of the universe.

LET’S NOT LOSE OUR WAY—

RICHARD G. RAUSCH
Principal, Webster Hill School, West Hartford, Connecticut

Today, there are few opportunities for children to learn
to read maps and compasses. At the same time that there
are fewer opportunities to learn how to ﬁnd one’s way through
unfamiliar country, there is an increased availability of time
for outdoor recreation. This includes camping and other
activities which open up the natural environment for those
who enjoy this activity. There are also grim reminders in
the daily newspapers that knowledge of survival techniques
may prove to be of great personal value. Time spent in the
schools learning some of the more simple map reading and
compass techniques is time well spent. Map reading and the
use of the compass should be part of the elementary school
curriculum. “Orienteering” is a term used to describe the
process of using a compass and map to ﬁnd one’s way
through unfamiliar territory.

As part of an extensive program in outdoor education in -

our school, the staff has found that orienteering can be easily
learned by elementary school students and teachers. Train-
ing in orienteering begins in the primary grades with the
simple concepts utilized in drawing classroom and playground
maps. Later, students draw maps of the school neighbor-
hood. These maps are compared with a topographic map of
the area. (Topographical maps may be obtained from the
U. S. Geographical Survey, Federal Center, Denver 25,
Colorado, if you live west of the Mississippi, and from the
U. S. Geographical Survey, Washington 25, D. C., if you
live east of the Mississippi, at a nominal price.) At once,
students note differences in the maps and ask questions con-
cerning the symbols used. Charts of familiar areas dispel
the mystery of reading maps and help young children learn
the meaning of map symbols. Maps quickly become their
friends and the tools they can rely upon when needed.

 

 

 

 

One test used to determine whether or not a child can
read a topographic map is to have him describe an imaginary
walk he is taking along a proscribed route. The attention he
must give to the symbols and map details encountered dur-
ing his supposed trip sharpens his ability to read maps.

ORIENTEERING requires the ability to use a compass.
There is nothing mysterious about using a compass in relation-
ship to map-walks or orienteering. Although there are several

types of compasses, an orienteering compass * is the easrest
to use for map walks since a directlon-of-travel arrow 18
imprinted on a transparent plastic plate. The housmg of
the compass can be rotated and has an “orienting arrow
indicating the north index of the instrument. . _

It has been clearly demonstrated that practice in. compass
use quickly develops adequate skill. This practice 18 accom-
plished on our schoolgrounds by use of a planned course
requiring several changes in direction in order to arrive at
the destination. Each child is made aware of the average
length of his pace and makes use of this knowledge in the
orienting practice course. The practice course is made
progressively more difﬁcult.

Children are also given practice in using the compass to
determine the direction of one point or object with respect
to another. Again, this practice is accomplished on the
school playground. With a regular compass in his hand, the
child faces in the direction he wishes to know. Holding his
compass level and steady in one hand, he must rotate the
compass until the north part of the needle coincides with
the north marking on the compass housing. Sighting along
the center of the compass, he reads the number of degrees

opposite his face (Arithmetic lessons become meaningful
in this exercise.) This is the line of travel to the object. He
also learns to use landmarks for sighting bearings,

At this point the students are ready to put map and com-
pass together to get from place to place. (Practice makes
perfect—whether in the art of orientccring, or in mastering
arithmetical processes.) The map must be oriented or lined
up with the surrounding area. This can be done by inspec-
tion of objects around the observer or by using the compass,

When using the compass, students must learn that in most
places a compass does not point to the true north. Compass
readings must be corrected for this factor or the destination
may not be reached. Each topographical map states the size
of the angle of declination between the direction the com-
pass needle points and true north. II' the declination is west,
the angle must be added, or it east. the angle must be sub-
tracted from the compass reading.

Practical application of the knowledge learned about com-
passes and maps is further developed when the sixth graders
participate in an outdoor education experience each year.
There. in unfamiliar countryside. they put their new found
skills to a real test as they lind their way easily and safely
to their planned destination. They have learned skills which
one day may be of invaluable service to them.

Problem Teaser

A third grade class studying simple machines was presented with the following Problem Teaser by their
teacher: “How can anyone in this room lift me off the ﬂoor without touching me?”
(The material to answer this Problem Teaser can be found on any playground.)

Air Force research has demonstrated that it would be impossible for a free ﬂoating astronaut to tighten
a bolt with an ordinary wrench. A turn of the free ﬂoating astronaut’s arm in one direction, no matter
how slight, would start him revolving in the opposite direction. This is the action-reaction pr1nc1ple discussed

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

 

In a spadeful of earth, the elementary school youngster
can witness one of the great dramas of life on earth. For
here, in the uppermost layer of the earth’s crust—the vital
topsoil—may be seen a myriad of actors in an unending
struggle for survival.

A twofold story is being carried on in this topsoil. On
the one hand are the agents of creation; on the other, the
agents of destruction. Will one group win over the other?
Or will a balance be attained between the opposing forces?
Let us bring in a spadeful of soil from the forest, the garden,
the lawn, the muck of the swamp. What is in it, and most
important, what is going on under our feet everyday?

You will see on examination that the soils from the vari-
ous places are remarkably similar. Contrary to ﬁrst appear-
ances, it is ﬁlled with living things. Be sure you have several
glass jars or small containers on hand to hold the various
inhabitants of the soil as you ﬁnd them.

You will ﬁnd legions of ants, beetles, sow bugs, ticks,
mites, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, round worms, seg-
mented worms, and a host of creatures too small to see with
the unaided human eye. All of these creatures are engaged
in a never ending struggle to rid the earth of the organic
remains of organisms which have grown, crawled, walked,
or ﬂown over the earth. These remains you will ﬁnd as
bits of leaves, roots, twigs, nut shells, and the shells, skele-
tons, and wastes of animals.

Helping in the breakup of these organic remains are the
bacteria of decay, and the branching threads (mycelia) of
the fungus plants. The latter will appear as white masses,
cottony in appearance. (A hand lens should be available so
you can see the true nature of fungus.)

The Role of Fungi

The role of fungi in the decay of plant and animal mate—
rials is most important. For fungi are able to decompose
proteins, cellulose, and even lignin in wood, as well as other
carbohydrates. They are tolerant of varied conditions of soil
moisture, acidity, and use up only a small amount of energy
material in building up their mycelia. Yet this mycelia be-
comes an important source of soil nitrogen. Once again the
drama is illustrated. The buildup of one material forms the
basis for the energy and life of another over and over again.

A SPADEFUL
OF EARTH

MAT'I‘HEVC' J. BRENNAN

Chief. Conservation Education Branch,
U. 5. Forest Service. W'oshinglon, I). C.

As soil dwellers labor to rid the earth of the residues of
life, they provide the minerals and energy which becomes
the source of life for other as yet unborn things. They re-
duce these dead materials to simple elements which can
be used once again in the food making processes of plants.
You can tell by the dark color of the soil that large amounts
of these materials for new life are present.

If we could look at the soil with the aid of a microscope,
we would see millions of bacteria of all kinds. They too
are engaged in the struggle of creation and destruction.
Some of them live in clusters in close association with plant
roots. Best known of these are the nitrogen-ﬁxing bacteria
which form little clumps (nodules) on the roots of legum68,
plants like clover, bean. pea, and alfalfa. These bacteria are
largely responsible for the nitrogen available to plants and
nitrogen is the basis for protein formation in plants and
thereby, for all animal bodies.

Tunnel Makers

As you dug up your spadeful of soil. you may have noticed
many holes or tunnels. Their makers may have escaped you,
but their presence is known anyway. (If your children are
alerted beforehand, few of the tunnel makers will escape.)
These burrows are the work of the larger organisms men-
tioned above. (The insects. worms, spiders, bees, and antS-)
Some larger tunnels may be the work of moles, shrews, mICB,
or ground squirrels. Even some birds like the burrowmg 0W1
live in the soil. All of these animals are actors in the great
drama of the soil. The insects keep the fungus in check; the
spiders and shrews feed on the insects; and the moles keep
the plants in balance by eating the roots of some. As they
live and die, their role changes from one of taker to one Of
contributor. .

AS your children examine their spadeful of earth, you W111
ﬁnd a whole new series of questions arising. What do the
worms do? What is this? What makes this soil so red, 01'
black, or yellow? .

Most important, let them wonder about the questions raised
in the beginning. There may not be any answer. .Maybe
nature has taken care of the answers by providing jllSt the
right amount of each type actor to keep this whole wonder—
ful world of the soil in balance.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 




 

 

 

 

How To Construct an Incubator

The children in a fourth grade class wanted to make an
incubator for use in their room. They discussed the problem
of “What must happen to make eggs hatch?” As a result of
reading, consulting persons in the community, and experi-
menting they made the incubator described here.

Materials and Construction

To make possible the hatching of chicken eggs in the class-
room an incubator can easily be made by using the following
suggested materials:

A sturdy, wooden box 10” wide, 10” high and 15” long—
the box to be open on one side.

A pane of glass 10” wide and 15” long to cover the open
side of the box.

A thermostatic switch suitable for an incubator. This may
be obtained from hardware stores anywhere or from Mont-
gomery Ward as listed in their 1951 catalogue—#87FM.

One incubator thermometer suitable for either brooder or
incubator. This, too, may be purchased at a hardware store.

Two bakelite or porcelain standard receptacle sockets to
hold light bulbs.

Two electric lightbulbs—preferably 15 watts each—to
serve as heaters.

Two electric attachment plugs.

One piece of hardware cloth about 12” wide and 18” long
to support no more than 12 eggs.

One large cake pan about 8” wide and 12” long to hold
water under hardware cloth.

Enough celotex, beaver board, or other insulating material
to line the inside of the incubator.

Miscellaneous nails, bolts, tape, paint and so on for use
in the construction of the incubator.

To construct the incubator using the suggested materials:

a. Nail the insulation inside the box.

b. Bore holes for ventilation and for the thermostat.

c. Screw or bolt the sockets and the thermostat inside the
box.

(1. Wire the sockets to a plug for attachment to the
thermostat. The wires may be stapled out of the way
along the top or back of the box.

e. Bind the glass front with adhesive or scotch tape. Use
two strips of adhesive tape about 11/2 inches wide to
form a double thickness ﬂap along the top edge. Tack
this ﬂap along the top edge of the box to hinge the
glass front.

Was It the REED SEA
' The Hebrews Crossed After Leaving Egypt?

(Continued from Page 5)

Even so recently as during the
past one hundred years, since the
digging of the Suez Canal between
the Mediterranean Sea and the Gulf
of Suez, which is the northwestern
arm of the Red Sea, this area has
changed in character. At least one
lake, Lake Ballah, has disappeared
since 1854. It is very likely, then,
that during Biblical times that region
was very marshy. Probably it was
one of these great swamps around
Lake Timsah or south of it which
the scribes called the “Reed Sea.”

Other facts contained in the Book
of Exodus are considered fairly ac-
curate. There is now no reason to
doubt the escape route described in
the Bible. But, by reason of the very
accuracy of this route, as conﬁrmed
by modern scholars in the ﬁeld of
Bible archaeology, we know that the
ancient, Hebrews couldn’t have crossed
the Red Sea, but must have traversed
the “Reed Sea”——-the Yam Suph.

So, modern science serves to clear
up an error of an old translator—~—
even while it veriﬁes the accuracy of

the B°ble.

He Upens Nature’s Gateways

Condensed from The Clin'stian Science Monitor
Temple Fielding

['1' HAS TAKEN John Ripley Forbes
17 years to repay his debt of
gratitude to one of America’s great
scientists. In doing so, he has built a
coast'to—coast chain of free chil-
dren’s museums and has revolution—
ized museum practice. Now no
hamlet is too small and no slum is
. too. dense to echo a child’s joyous
squeals as he fondles a live opossum
or sits entranced by nature movies.

All this started when Johnny
Forbes, then a 14-year—old Boy
Scout, went 'on a hike through the
woods near Stamford, Conn. He dis-
covered a frog that had just swal—
lowed a ﬁreﬂy. The insect glowed
brightly through the membranes of
the frog’s stomach. Iohn took this
spectacular exhibit to his neighbor,
Dr. William T. Hornaday, director
of the New York Zoological Park

and world—famous naturalist. Dr.
Hornaday received him gravely.
As one scientist to another, the boy
and the elderly zoologist exchanged
their views. The gentleness, the kind—

scum within a museum.” Later the
collection was transferred to a shed
in a Stamford park. Youngsters
ﬂocked there to play with tame por—
cupines and skunks, to see stuffed
animals, to take country hikes.

After graduation from Bowdoin
College, young Forbes set out to or-
ganize a larger project—~for chil.
dren only. A Stamford Museum As—
sociation was formed, with Dr.
Hornaday its honorary president.
Forbes rented three rooms in a
bank building. Stamford attics were
scoured for stuffed birds, butterﬂies
and other specimens.

This humble project, with Forbes.

as curator at $20 a week, started a

new trend in museums for children. .

Gone were the somber hush,'thé for—
bidding glass cases. By 1937 his ex-
hibits were drawing record crowds.
_ Then Forbes heard that a philan—
thropist had willed a 74-room man—
sion to Kansas City for use as a
museum -— but not a penny was
available to remodel or stock it.
Forbes borrowed $100 and climbed
into his car. “I’ve come to work,” he
told the startled president of the
new museum, association in Kansas
City. “I’ll raise the money, set up a
ﬁrst-class museum, open a children’s
program, and go without pay until
you can afford me.”

In a whirlwind subscription cam'
paign, young Forbes, a stranger, per‘
sonally raised $25,000. He begged,
borrowed —— or, on rare occasions,
purchased '—-— 160,000 specimens, in—
cluding a whale, a buffalo, extinct
birds, fossils, and an outstanding

 

collection of Indian relics. In four
months his educational program was
teaching 1000 children a week.

Dr. . Hornaday died that year.
Forbes wanted a living memorial for
his great. mentor. With the enthusi-
astic support of prominent friends
and admirers of the late scientist, the
William T. Hornaday Memorial
Foundation was formed and Forbes
worked out a plan to bring exhibits
into slum districtsand rural areas.

Then war was declared. Forbes
enlisted in the Medical Section of
the Air Corps and was ordered to
Napier Field, Alabama —— and‘found
the opportunity he sought.

It was his ﬁrst look at the rural
South. The needs of the children
shocked him. He telephoned a
cinema library in Washington to
rush him two reels of natural—
history film. On his day off, he bor-
rowed a GI projector and took a bus

r to Geneva, a village 40 miles away.

He showed his pictures to the
school children, took them on a na‘
ture walk, then sat down in a hastily
called meeting of school leaders to
map out a campaign for the future.

Before the week was out, he had
written to 20 museums, asking for
discarded or duplicate exhibits. '
Specimens began to arrive from all
over the country. For 18 months
Forbes spent all his free time on this
ﬁrst Hornaday Foundation project,
covering 40 rural schools in a 140—
mile area. It was a thrill for the chil—
dren, and for Forbes. He had never
seen such enthusiasm, such hunger
for. knowledge.

 




THE READERIS DIGEST

In 1943 he was transferred to
Tennessee. On his second day in
Nashville he visited the State Mu-
seum. It was crowded, untidy, an-
tiquated. Within a week Forbes had
called on 15 prominent citizens.
In remarkably sh0rt order, private
subscriptions totaled $15,000. A
building to house a children’s mu—
seum was found in an older section
of the city.

Forbes got a three—day pass and
ﬂew to New York in search of speci-
mens. The American Museum of
‘ Natural History, responding beyond
his wildest dreams, sent three large
vans of displays. The Smithsonian
Institution sent several hundred

pounds of fauna, including a pair of

huge coyotes. (The date on the
faded label of this exhibit was 1884;

the animals had been shot and
mounted by William T. Hornadav.)

When word of Forbes’ activities
reached Jacksonville, Fla., a com—
mittee of citizens asked him to reor—
ganize their floundering establish
ment. It took him exactly 12 days to
make a complete survey, install his
plan and hire a director. Later Holt—
ville, Ala., requested its own Foun—
dation branch. Shortly thereafter
the Army gave Forbes his honorable
discharge. In his spare time he had
built ﬁve museums from the ground
up. Now he could spread his gospel
to millions of youngsters.

Fort Worth, Texas, approached
him. The city fathers had planned a
bond issue for a museum-building
program. Kindled by his enthusiasm,
they included a children’s museum in

their plans. Soon a model children’s
museum, the last word in scientiﬁc
construction, will open its doors in a
brand—new $300,000 building.

Atlanta, (33., has a 70-acre plot
and three old museum buildings.
Forbes revitalized the project, and
now- hundreds of Girl and Boy
Scouts use the grounds for camping,
learning handicrafts and outdoor
lore. -

At present Forbes is organizing
his newest installation in Portland,
Ore. Fifty-three other cities, towns
and villages have requested his serv«
ices within the past year.

Forbes and the Foundation’s
Board of Trustees do not make all—
expense grants. Instead they try to
arouse a community interest that
will assure continuation of the pr0j~
ect. Their ﬁrst function is to serve
as consulting experts -- to organize,
to furnish exhibits, equipment, per-
sonnel, and sufﬁcient funds for a ﬂy,
ing start. When the museum is
thoroughly organized, the elders
stirred up, and the children practi—
cally breaking down the doors to
see it, the Foundation moves on.

During the past 18 months Forbes
has traveled 63,000 miles to spread
the wonders of nature before Amer—
ica'is youth. The Hornaday Founda-
tion now has on display more than
1,000,000 separate exhibits. it. is a
new era in naturalhistory educa»
tion. Iohn Ripley Forlxss has paid
off his debt to Dr. William T. Herr
naday, the great scientist who ever
preached “Open Wide to Youth All
Gateways to Nature.”

A MUSEUM FOR JUNIORS?

Pets to take home, aid for youth groups, classroom assistance
in learning about nature in all her ramifications, field trips to
view the “wonders which God has wrought”-—all these are avail-
able to the children of your town through the junior museum
movement.

HOW IT ALL STARTED

Started over 60 years ago, the movement now has spread to
include 54 cities throughout the United States, and in time, will
reach many more communities if the present plans of the National
Foundation for Junior Museums, Inc., are successful. This unique
organization, formerly the William T. Hornaday Memorial Foun-
dation, was incorporated in 1942, and from this date to 1954
has sponsored 22 museums in 12 states.

 

Children view beautiful wild life display at the California
Iunior Museum. Exhibit made by Foundation exhibit lab-
oratory technicians.

]ohn Ripley Forbes, Whose interest in natural history was stim-
ulated, as a boy, by the immortal Dr. William T. Hornaday, the
late director of the New York Zoological Park, directs the na-
tional foundation. Dr. Hornaday’s creed, ”OPEN WIDE TO
YOUTH ALL GATEWAYS TO NATURE,” has become the
guiding principle of Forbes in his zeal to start a junior museum in
every community in the United States.

The National Foundation for Junior Museums aids a community
in getting a junior museum properly organized and financed
without charging the town or city for such service, in fact, con-
tributing funds and exhibits to the community if official spon-
sorship is granted. The foundation is able to give this aid because
its services are financed through an endowment fund and from

 

contributions it receives each year from several foundations and
various individuals. Forbes and his associates give highly skilled
service and stimulate within the community keen interest and
enthusiasm resulting in development of a new junior museum.

”Many adults go around in this troubled world with their
eyes completely closed to what is going around them,” Forbes has

frequently said. ”We feel if more children can be taught some.

thing about the great out of doors, of nature and her many secrets,
they will grow to better adulthood and will get more out of life
than did their parents.”

SUCCESS STORY

Among the projects formally sponsored by the foundation have
been the Nashville Children’s Museum, now attractively housed
in a 24 room stone building, which has become a vital force for
the entire state of Tennessee. At Fort Worth, Texas, this pro-
gram has been so successful that the citizens voted a $500,000.00
bond issue—and Fort Worth youngsters have the largest and
most modern children’s museum in the country.

More than 500,000 children and adults alike already are well
along the path of learning about these secrets since the first
West Coast project, the California Junior Museum was opened in
Sacramento two yeares ago. Museums are also operating in San
Jose and San Mateo. One could give many other success stories,
but the most impressive way to learn how valuable a junior mu-
seum can be is to start one in your community.

YOUR COMMUNITY AND THE FOUNDATION .

A community showing an interest in starting its own junior
museum asks the foundation for counsel. The services of Forbes
and his staff are immediately made available in a steering capa-
Clty. It is up to the community to complete its own organization,
do the ground work, and raise the money necessary for the mu-
seum to open. An outright gift of $1000.00 is made by the .Foun-
dation toward the first year’s budget. Then, mounted spec1mens,
displays, and other items worth more than $2000.00 are given as
glfts t0 the fledgling institution from the Foundation’s Exhibit
Laboratory. No estimate of the cost of the services and profes-
§10nal counseling given by the foundation to the junior museums
in their formative stages has ever been made but these serv1C€S
are considerable.

BENEFITS OF A JR. MUSEUM

Once in Operation, the museum offers a full course of nature
StUdY given by trained professionals in the field of natural his-
tory and conservation. Children are escorted on field trips for a
Practical application of what they read and hear about in the mu-
seum Pr0per. Museum trained youngsters know there exrsts a

mg and aPPTECiation of the out of doors and of its wild life. A

resources, and better appreciates the importance of prOtECUﬂg
and preserving this rich heritage for future generations.

 

A typical junior museum has glass cases at child’s eye level.
These cases contain attractive exhibits of the great out of doors.
Birds and animals of all types and descriptions, colorful butter-
flies and insects, mineral and gem collections, to mention but a
few, are attractively arranged in a manner certain to appeal to the
young visitor.

 

Field trips for junior explorers among junior museum's
most popular activities.

ANIMAL LENDING LIBRARY—AND LIVE MUSEUM

Porcupines, raccoons, owls, gray foxes, squirrels, snakes, and
some ”deodorized” skunks are a few of the exhibits in the live
animal section. The young visitors are allowed to help prepare
the food for the live animals in a sparkling kitchen. They also
feed the alligators and turtles. All young visitors have an Oppor-
tunity to touch and get acquainted with the live exhibits.

One of the most popular departments is the pet lending library,
a, must for all junior museums. After children are properly
trained, guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, rats, and other small
animals are taken home for a week of study or just plain lovrng,
much as a child would borrow a book from a lending library.

These same animals frequently are taken to children’s hospi-
tals or convalescent homes where they are viewed wrth delight
by the small shut-ins.

HIGH LIGHTS

Among the activities of the modern junior museum are a live
museum, animal lending library, museum tours for school classes,
hObby clubs for children after school hours, museum games,
treasure hunts, arts and crafts, astronomy, educational m-ovres,
aid to Scouts and Camp Fire Girls, story hour for little folks, na-
ture trails, camping, field trips, and a special program for the

handicapped.

 

 




PROGRAM ENDORSED BY CIVIC LEADERS

FOrbes’ program has been heartily endorsed by religious, edu-
cational, medical and other leaders in every community having
a junior museum. “Children should be given an opportunity to
knowand appreciate the works of creation which are all part of
God’s world, and we believe the establishment of a junior mu-
seum will help immeasurably in providing such knowledge,
say Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish clergymen. ”Men are inclined
to be religious if they have some knowledge of God as a creator",
they said. ”Youngsters see what comes from the hand of God by
getting in touch with nature.”

Iohn Ripley Forbes helps young visitors get acquainted A
with tame foxes from the popular live museum.

Educators see in the junior museum program the living em-
bodiment of their visual education aspirations. Physicians and
surgeons laud the program for its ability to erase potential neu-
rosis. They contend a museum is a springboard for absorbing
hobbies which can do and continue into old age.

”It is relaxing to get out of doors and see what God has cre-
ated besides me,” said one. ”This contact with the outside has
taught me that my petty troubles are not too important, after all.”

Naturalists generally are enthusiastic in their support of the
Foundation’s program. So are conservationists who believe a host
of youngsters trained in this field are far more valuable to the
nation than a few professional conservationists.

NATIONAL RECOGNITION

Various national publications, including the Saturday Eveni
Post, McCalls, Ladies Home Journal, Reader’s Digesr, Life a
Time Magazines, to mention a few, have carried stories ext
the merits of the junior museum program as it has been observed
in Boston, Massachusetts; Nashville, Tennessee; Jacksonville
Florida; Fort Worth, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Durham, Nortli
Carolina, and Sacramento, California.

JUNIOR HUMANE SOCIETIES OR ANIMAL CLUBS

Today there is an increased interest by the American public and
students in science. This can be a good or bad sign. Children are now
realizing that a great future is open to them if they apply themselves in
school. They now begin to see that "marks" are important and the in'—
telligent student is becoming respected and not being ridiculed by hiS
peers for his God-given gifts.

In this way high interest in science is fine and good. We live in a
scientific age, but over-emphasis on science with a neglect of the
humanities can result in utter catastrophe for our civilization.

Young people, with few exceptions, possess an insatiable curiosity
concerning their world. Their world encompasses many things. par—
ticularly animals. Many children have daily or almost daily contact
with animals of all kinds. How children react to these animals and
treat them is developed in their formative years. Thus, attitudes are
formed that will prevail on into adulthood. The kind of adults who will
help run our country in the future are acquiring their attitudes now.

We are determining our own future, to a large extent, by our training
of young people today.

How shall we help our youngsters to grow into fine adults with high

and decent ideals--in short, adults of a scientific mind working With a
moral soul.

Qne of the best ways to accomplish this is to instill high humane
in our youth bY 8111(1ng them correctly. What better way than bY

One may be formed easily enough, because children are generally
enthusiastic and receptive to new things--especia11y clubs. Forming a
club is really the easiest part. How to maintain a vital, interested
membership is another story.

Young people need direction and leadership. They respond well to
an enthusiastic person who can lead them without seeming to dictate to
them. A wise leader will soon come to recognize those children who
possess leadership qualities and will work through them in directing
the club.

Any club must have, besides able leadership, certain goals, rules,
and regulations to guide the organization. These can best be stated in
a club constitution that is formulated by the members under skilled
guidance of the club sponsor.

A sample constitution is given here to provide a guide. There
should not be a great deal of deviation from this example.

7. No meeting may be held where any decisions are reached, votes
taken or any action is taken unless a quorum is present at the
meeting. A quorum shall consist of 1/3 of the members on the

roll at the time of the meeting exclusive of the officers and
Sponsor. Where "members" appear in this document regarding
"Those members present at a meeting, " it shall be in compli-
ance with this section of the by—laws.

. These by-laws may be amended by a 2/3 vote of the members
present at a regularly scheduled meeting.

During formation of this club, the sponsor shall act as president
pro tempore until a slate of officers is approved and a president
elected. Immediately upon his/her election to the office of presi—
dent that person shall be sworn in by the sponsor and assume the
duties of this office and conduct the rest of the meeting.

Once the club is organized and established it is the sponsor's job
to keep it alive and a potent force for good. This can be done in many
ways and each Sponsor will soon discover what method works best with
his particular group.

Many times young people will do a good job with a project if one
of them suggest it and not an adult. If there is some particular thing
the sponsor believes should be undertaken then he might talk it over
with the officers and they might suggest it to the other members.
Generally, though, young people possess active, idea—producing minds
and the sponsor's job will be one of help; sustaining enthusiasm dis-
played at the outset of a project. The sponsor also may find himself
in the position of discouraging some idea that is obviously (to an adult)
too great an undertaking for a group of youngsters. Sometimes pre~
senting the facts to them will convince them that it is much more than
they can handle. The financial or time-consuming features can be
stressed in this case.

In other leaflets of this kit there are many activities listed. These
range from pet care to nature study. The latter is certainly not out-
side the scope of a club of this type because one cannot study nature as
a whole without directly involving animal life. If children learn to
understand the definite benefit that snakes and toads, for instance, are
to us they will also see that there is a real reason for not killing them.
The more understanding one has of the out of doors, the more one
realizes that our Creator has not placed man on the earth as a separate
entity from the rest of the living world about him. The ”wildll creatures
also live intricate, exciting lives, not too far removed from similar

happenings of our own. They also are capable of understanding and re—
turning love.

It is hoped that the material contained here will be of value to any -
one organizing a Junior Humane Society. There is a great need for this
Work in a world plagued by tensions, doubts, and fears. When people
feel they are accomplishing something good and of value, the rewards
of the heart are tremendous. Young people especially must have this
feeling of accomplishment in connection with their organization. This
is something that must be seen to, for no matter how rocket-like the
club starts off, it will fizzle like a damp fuse and die without the neces-
sary impetus to rise as it should.

HERE are few things that hold a
depth of interest for children as do

pets and other animals. Yet, because
they often know so little of their ways
and needs, children cause them discom-
fort and sometimes thoughtlessly mis-
treat them. That is why over sixty years
ago the American Humane Education
Society pioneered in the formation of
groups of girls and boys known as
“Bands of Mercy” or “Animal Clubs.”
The primary purpose is to help children
to acquire a greater knowledge, under-
standing, and sympathy for their pets,
farm animals, and wild life. Further
opportunities present themselves for
overcoming fears and superstitions that
often manifest themselves in a desire to
kill and destroy. The study of the won-
ders of the animal world about us can
develop into many interests, including
practical and helpful knowledge of na-
ture’s ways and a love of the beautiful.
Such programs can give children new
appreciations and ideals. Likewise, they
are made aware of man’s dependence
on animals and their obligation to treat
them with consideration and kindness.
The major purpose of Bands of Mercy
or Animal Clubs concerns itself with
the character development of girls and
boys. . Under teacher guidance, the use
of animals in the classroom makes the
study of health, diet and the nature of
the world we live in a most appealing
unit. Character traits which are ac-
qulred along with facts are good man-

ners, relations with others in the
community, meeting and carrying out
responsibilities, kindness, h 0 n e s t y,
thoughtfulness and tolerance, to men-
tion a few. All these should result from
a good relationship with a pet.

This leaflet calls attention to many
aspects of humane education, and it is
our hope you may find stimulation for
the formation of an Animal Club in
your school. To have a sympathy for
others less fortunate and a concern for
their welfare are qualities that lead to
good citizenship.

How to Form a Club in Your
School or llv'rit/I Other Groups
of Children

1. Either a written or oral notice
should be made of the purposes and
objectives of the proposed club and a
call for a preliminary meeting for all
interested children.

2. Ten or more young people of a
like age group shall constitute a club

or band.

3. There shall be no dues to Na—
tional Irleadquarters, each club or band
deciding for itself what dues are neces—
sary for its own budget.

4. If, after the preliminary meeting,
it is voted to form a club, suitable
officers should be elected with the adult
leader as an ex officio member of the
executive committee.

5. The basic requirement for all
membership is a pledge of kindness to
be signed or said orally before the adult
leader or at a meeting of the club as
follows:

I SHALL TRY TO BE KIND
TO ALL LIVING CREATURES
AND TRY TO PROTECT
THEM FROM ALL ACTS OF
CRUELTY.

6. The club will be recognized by
National Headquarters upon recelpt O
a letter from the secretary, giving the
name of the club and the number 0

' of animals and a. recent copy of the
magazine, OUR DUMB ANIMALS,
will then be sent. A membership card
and pin, although not necessary, may be
, ,_.. procured for 5 cents.

The frequency of meetings should
be determined by the group itself but
should be set at regular times. They
should be divided into two parts: An
information period, and an entertain-
ment period. Members should be en-
couraged to participate in the questions
or problems arising at meetings.

The following topics and objectives
for meetings will help children under-
stand and appreciate the animals with
which they have frequent association:

I. THE DOG
A. The history, ancestry and evolution
of the dog.

1. The dog’s part as protector and
helper of primitive man, as evi—
dent from prehistoric remains.

2. The important role of dogs in
the ancient cultures of Egypt,
Assyria, China, and Greece.

I. The various groups of dogs and
different breeds known as “pure—
bred,” as listed by the American
Kennel Club.

2. The dog as a friend and compan-
ion and as a guardian of prop-
erty, as a draft animal, as a
herder of cattle and sheep, as a
companion and seeing—eye of the
blind, for running down crimi-
nals, and for war purposes in
military zones.

I). The consideration of the genera]
care of the dog from a puppy to an
adult dog.

I. Whenever possible, use live dogs
to demonstrate, in the presence
of a veterinarian or other com-
petent person.

Discuss such items as foods and
feedings, sleeping accommoda-
tions, grooming and bathing,
state and local animal laws.

3. Common diseases and accidents
of dogs and ﬁrst—aid treatment.

4. Training the dog in basic obedi-
ence and how to use the special
training collar. Secure, if possi-
ble, a well—trained dog and his
master to demonstrate.

5. Bring and display pictures, clip-
pings, and other interesting ma-
terial concerning dogs.

11. THE CAT

A. The domestic cat of today.

affairs of man.

2. Misconceptions and superstitions
about the cat which are fairly
commonly accepted.

3. The cat as an object of worship
in Ancient Egypt.

4. The cat as companion and mas-
cot.

5. Its usefulness as a protector of
property from the ravages of
rodents.

6. The cat’s intelligence, self-reli-
ance, independence and adapt-
ability.

1. Feeding, sleeping quarters,
grooming and handling.

2. Special problems— laws for
ownership and protection from
cruel acts, the tendency to de-
stroy bird life, dog enemies.

3. Know the symptoms of common
diseases of cats. Learn what
should be done for home treat-
ment, and what cases should be
treated under the direction of a
veterinarian.

III. OTHER DOMESTIC PETS

A. Hamsters, guinea pigs, rabbits, and

goldfish are only a few of the an-

imals that may be brought to a

meeting to acquaint the members of

the proper ways of caring for them.

1. Learn the state laws and local
ordinances involving all animals,
their control and their humane
treatment.

2. Learn of the rise and fall of
certain groups of animals and of
their migration over the earth.

3. Look up the background of each
animal, country of origin, type
of habitat and climate it came
from, what it was developed for.

IV. NATURE STUDY AND
WILDLIFE

. It is important to recognize that the

conservation of wildlife, forests and
soil is of vital concern to us all.
Close grazing, “clean” farming,
drainage, uncontrolled trapping,
ﬁshing and hunting have all con-
tributed to the decimation of our

land and wildlife.

. Background information of condi-

tions of the field and forest as the
early settler found it.

1. For unnumbered centuries phys-
ical combat between man and
beast was part of the daily
struggle for food.

[\J

Modern agriculture and com-
merce now supply us with other
and better means of subsistence.

3. The hunting instinct, the rod
and gun for many has not yet
disappeared.

a. modern games like tennis,
baseball and football require
physical stamina but avoid
the moral retrogressions of
wanton killing.

b. one of the major problems
among hunters and ﬁshermen
is the failure to live up to
ethical codes established by
the better “sportsmen’s” or-
ganizations which often
exceed the letter of the law.

Recognizing that because of the u}-
set of nature by man, certain speCICS
of animals become destructive and
others lack a sufﬁcient food supply
because of overpopulation, we
should always be as humane as
possible in reducing the supply 0f
animals.

1. The steel trap causes undue
suffering, even when used ‘prOP’
erly."

2. Poor marksmanship causes injur-
ies to deer and other anirnflls,
resulting in a slow agonizmg

death.

V. SUGGESTED PROGRAM
ACTIVITIES

A. Trips and visits

1. Any natural area, whether it is
woodland, field, abandoned city
lot, seashore, pond or stream,
varies greatly with seasonal
changes. A trip to an area of

_ / 7— > \ ~ _ thls sort during each of the sea-

sights, hardly give the animal a
sporting chance.

4. The control of many species of
wild animals should be strictly
supervised by responsible agen-
cies of government rather than
left to a regular hunting or trap-
ping season.

D. Many individuals have devoted their

lives to furthering the cause of ‘con-
servation and wildlife management.
They have waged the fight for con-
servation in the face of overwhelm-
ing odds. The battle continues today
and will in the future. Perhaps you
may be one of the great leaders of
future ﬁghts for conservation. These
are but a few of the outstanding
warriors.

I. Theodore Roosevelt—the con-
servation president who awak-
ened our nation to its dwindling
resources.

2. Aldo Leopold —— author of
GAME MANAGEMENT who
started wildlife management de-
partments in American Colleges.

3. Gifford Pinchot—chief of the
Forestry Division of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and built
up the Division.

4. Find people in your area that
have worked for conservation.
Perhaps they will help your club

on a conservation project.

 

during the different times of the
year.

Visit a farm and observe ways
the farmer cares for his livestock
and his land. Ask him to explain
the good land management prac-
tices he employs. Look around
the fields for evidence of wildlife
and determine how it benefits
him.

Visit a museum to see its inter-
esting exhibits of ancient animals
and strange animals in other
parts of the world. A great deal
about our own native animals
will also be available. The im-
portant things to learn here are
the habits and environment of
animals and their relationships
to people in the countries in
which they live.

. Visit the local humane society

and animal hospital and become
informed of what is being done
to prevent cruelty to animals at
the Stockyards, riding schools,
rodeos, circuses, and investiga-
tion of complaints, and what
should be done for lost and in-
jured animals.

. Visit a dog show or county fair

and learn about showing animals
and what traits breeders are
trying to bring out in various
animals.

The art of outdoor or nature
photography is fascinating. Visit
or invite a person who has this
hobby. Perhaps he will take the
club on an actual ﬁeld demon-
stration. Later he may show you
the pictures that were taken and

help some interested member
develop his ability along this
line.

7. Land that is worn out olIers a
real challenge to restore it to a
healthy state. Such land is all
too common in this country.
Conceivably the club might se-
cure permission to try and de-
veloP this area. A sanctuary
might be established on the land.

B. Classroom or club-meeting activities.

1. Bring in display pictures, clip—
pings, and other interesting ma-
terial concerning the animals you
are interested in.

2. Encourage oral and written re-
ports and stories about animals.
Such activities help children
acquire poise before a group, in-
telligent observation, and skill in
looking up reference material.

3. Arrange a discussion on what
can be done through sanctuaries
and other measures to save an-
imals and birds that are making
a last stand for survival (whOOp-
ing crane, key deer).

4. Some meetings or time could be

‘ devoted to the building of bird
houses and feeding trays.

5. Bulletin boards, displays or ex-
hibits may be set up in the club
room or store windows, where
the public may View them.

6. Simple marionettes may be made
For a puppet show or an animal

story may be dramatized by the
class or club (see Bibliography).

7. Activities for the entertainment
part of a meeting.

a. show an animal ﬁlm.

b. a good reader may read se~
lected stories.

c. play the Twenty Questions
animal Identiﬁcation game.

d. try to ﬁnd a bird or animal’s

name starting with each
letter in the name of a fa-
mous humanitarian or nat-
uralist like Henry Bergh,
George Angell, or John J.
Audubon.

e. solve an animal cross-word
puzzle.

F. prepare a script about animals
for a simulated broadcast
with three or four members.
It may be good enough for a
radio station to put on during

Be Kind to Animals Week.

Friendship with girls and boys is a
rich and rewarding experience. To an
older person, who will share their fun
and help them in their interests, they
will be enthusiastic and responsive.
There is hardly a young person who
would not like to own a pet, but ex-
perience shows many children lack a
pr0per understanding of their needs and
a sense of responsibility other than the
immediate pleasure of ﬁrst acquiring a
pet.

In order to help these pets and other
animals, Opportunities should be pro-
vided for greater knowledge and experi—
ences. As a child learns to care pr0perly
for an animal, understanding and ap-
preciation will develop. There will be
a growing sense of kinship and a sym-
pathy for animal life. Kindness comes
through understanding, a quality which
will help in the character development
of girls and boys.

In using this publication it should be
remembered that the suggestions con-
tained herein must be considered to be
general. The clubs using this leaﬂet
will have to modify their programs to

suit their own particular situation. We
cannot prepare a leaﬂet speciﬁcally for
all age groups or whether they live in
the city, town, suburbs, rural areas, mid—
west or coastal areas. The ingenuity
of the sponsor and that of the club
members will, to a large extent, deter-
mine programs and activities. The Amer-
ican Humane Education Society will be
pleased to hear from clubs and try to
help them as much as possible.

A word of caution might be men-
tioned here. When the club undertakes a
project, the sponsor should be sure that:
(I) it is worthy of the club’s attention,
(2) the majority of the members wish to
undertake it, (3) it is not too ambitious
an undertaking for the age and abilities
of the group, and (4) that it will not
channel all the activities of the club into
one narrow area for too long a time. It
must be remembered that there is more
to the world of living things than merely,
for example, a sanctuary, care of house
pets, or building bird houses. Although
all these things may well be activities or
projects within the general aims of the
group, exclusive concentration in any
one of these would spell stagnation and
a slow stiinng death for the club.

Young people are curious people. One
often wonders if they can make a state-
ment, for most of their talking seems to
consist of, “Why?, What?, When?,
Where?, and How?” Adults must foster
the curiosity of children and not stifle
it. Children want to learn and ﬁnd the
answers to things. Through their own

efforts in a live, active club they can
ﬁnd many answers about this wonderful
world. They will discover why cats should
never have collars or ribbons fastened
around their necks; why puppies should
be fed five times a day and adult dogs
only once or twice; why a dog should
not have a weekly “Saturday night”
bath; and how to combat destructive
rats and mice. The questions to be
answered are limitless.

A sponsor is needed that is able to
channel the boundless energy of young-
sters into constructive projects and ac-
tivities that will help children ﬁnd an-
swers to their questions. Too often a
young peoples’ club that has little or no
adult guidance will aimlessly and in—
evitably drift toward dissolution. It is
a rare group of youngsters that can for-
mulate a club for constructive purposes,
and maintain it at an active level, with-
out adult guidance.

CARE OF
A
PET RABBIT

So you are considering the adoption of a charming creature with
amusing and whimsical ways, a story -book character--a rabbit.

Someone has offered it to you, but you want to know how much time
may be necessary to take care of it properly, to be sure you really want it
for your very own. Poor care of any pet borders on neglect and cruelty,
causing acute suffering and an unhappy experience.

This leaflet will point out the important things you must learn to do
if you are to have fun and enjoyment from your pet rabbit and to keep it safe

and well.

A place for your rabbit to live:

 

For its own protection and rest and privacy, it is necessary to build
for your rabbit a cage (called a hutch) which is strong and easy to keep clean.
It can be made from wooden boxes or strips of 2" x 2" lumber. The larger
the better, but it should be at least four feet long, two feet wide and two
feet high, and raised three feet from the ground as a protection from dogs.
A sleeping compartment partitioned off should be about a foot wide with
the necessary doorway to the other part of the hutch. Use a good one ~half
inch wire netting for the front and the floor of the cage. You will need a
door on the front, and also a corner trough to keep food clean. Roof the
top of the hutch with waterproof material, and place it outdoors in the shade.
A rabbit needs plenty of fresh air but must avoid too much cold and be free
from dampness. Some form of shutter with proper ventilation should be
fastened across the front at night. A good dry basement is a good place to
keep your rabbit during the winter months.

Handling a rabbit:

 

Never lift a rabbit by its ears or legs. The right way is to grasp
the loose skin above the shoulders with one hand, placing the other hand
under the hind quarters to support its weight. This will prevent kicking
and struggling.

A rabbit should be allowed certain liberty rather than being cooped
up all the time. It will respond to kind treatment and become very tame
and an enjoyable friend and companion. It does not care to be held too often,
but it will jump on your lap or snuggle beside you of its own free will.

 




Food:

Do not overfeed your rabbit unless it has plenty of exercise in a
ground run, the bottom of which must have wire buried in the ground; other-
wisea rabbit will dig his way out. Whole grains such as oats, wheat, barley,
carrots, beets, turnips, cut clover or grass at midday, and some hay at
night. Some grain may be left at night in the feeding trough. Never leave
green stuff lying about. Good hay helps prevent indigestion and impacted
teeth. Excellent rabbit pellets are available and may be used with other feed,
half and half by weight. It is said a good rule is to feed as much as a rabbit
will clean up in half an hour and no more. Be sure to provide fresh water at
all times. If you feed cabbage, use it sparingly, both for the health of the
rabbit and for the cleanliness of the hutch, which must be cleaned daily or
your pet may develop some disease.

Keeping your rabbit well:

 

Proper feeding and strict cleanliness are absolutely necessary to
build resistance and prevent disease of rabbits. There are certain symptoms
caused by the common disease affecting domestic rabbits. Excessive
coughing and sneezing and discharge of the nostrils are probably a cause of
snuffles. Another disease, called coccidiosis, affecting intestines and

liver, has general symptoms of poor appetite, anemia, loss of weight,
listlessness and is often fatal. Ear mange is caused by a mite. Hock

trouble is caused by uneven floors or those with too large a mesh. Symptoms
of digestive troubles are thin, watery diarrhea, rough coat, squinted and dull
eyes, and prone ears. Slobbers, or when a rabbit drools saliva from its
mouth, is caused by the rodent teeth that never stop growing and must be worn
down with chewing hard foods like hay cut in short lengths. Such a condition
causes discomfort and indigestion.

As with all animals that become sick or injured, the best advice
is to call your local veterinarian and let him diagnose the illness and suggest

the treatment the re of.

Grooming:

 

The coat should be kept clean and free from mats. Brushing
helps, but good, clean bedding of hay and a good diet contribute to a clean
healthy coat.

Cushioned Claws

ELL-MEANING pet owners too often

have unhappy experiences with their
animals because they are misinformed or
thoughtless. This is especially true of chil-
dren who through lack of knowledge of the
pet’s habits and characteristics, too much
handling or unwarranted fears cause discom-
fort to, and sometimes mistreatment of these
animals. This brief leaﬂet on cats and two
similar leaﬂets on dogs and parakeets will
help the teacher give the child the “know-
how” on fundamentals of proper care. It
will also serve as an introduction to extensive
literature on the subject.

The ingenious teacher recognizes the im-
portant place animals should occupy in the
curriculum and will provide group participa-
tion in discussions, handwork and visits to
places where animals are kept.

One may have no idea of having a cat in
his home until a forlorn stray, grateful for a
kind word and a saucerful of milk, or an
appealing kitten comes to your attention
and suddenly you realize you have adopted

a eat. If you own a dog already, the dog
and cat must learn to be friendly. This can
be accomplished by both animals being in-
troduced to one another in the same room
but each one restrained. Each animal can
be talked to and petted, and then separated.

l/ATAU ,
BUR/Vi” .53”

Gradually they will become accustomed to
the presence of each other in the house and
will become friends.

Sleeping quarters. Cats like to sleep in a
warm dry place, not the dark cellar. It
should be in a secluded spot with no drafts.
A box lined with a blanket makes a good
bed. It should be placed preferably above
ﬂoor level, for it gives a cat a sense of
security.

The mother cat —— care and feeding. Many
agree that a cat should be taken to a veteri-
narian to be spayed after ﬁve months or
castrated after eight or ten months, for it
has many advantages. A mother cat needs
much nourishing food, and when her time is
approaching, prepare a box which will allow
her to stretch out at full length and will also
give room for her kittens to reach her as they
nurse. The mother cat likes a dark secluded
place for her family and is an excellent
mother, keeping the kittens warm and clean.
At four weeks the kittens should be given
some warm milk in addition to the mother’s
feeding. It is best to leave kittens with their
mother for at least six —— preferably eight ——
weeks. At that time when the mother no
longer feeds them, the kittens will require
four or ﬁve meals a day. Cereal or pablum
with milk for three meals, and a tablespoon-
ful of ﬁnely cut—up meat or canned strained
baby meat with minced vegetables for the
other meals, and a few drops daily of one
of the concentrated vitamin preparations
promote healthy growth. At three months
three larger meals will be enough, and an
adult cat needs only one or two meals a
day, with fresh water available. Kittens are
born blind, and it is ten days before their
eyes open. The second set of teeth appear

 




when they are about six months old. Cats
need meat and some ﬁsh. Good canned dog
food or fresh hamburg is the basis of a good
diet. Never feed bones. Never place kit-
tens in a new home unless you are sure they
will be well taken care of. Any veterinarian
can humanely put an unwanted cat to sleep.
lnoculations against panleucopenia (“cat
typhoid”—“distemper”) should be started
after six weeks of age, and “booster” inocu-
lations should be given whenever a cat is
hospitalized or boarded.

Grooming and training. Cats are clean in
all their habits. The cat having access to the
out—of—doors will take care of its needs,
otherwise a pan ﬁlled with sand, sawdust,
shredded paper, or “kitty litter” must be
provided and frequently cleaned. Brushing
a cat’s coat daily from head to tail and short
upward strokes in the reverse direction re-
moves dust and odors and loose hairs. This
is absolutely necessary for the long-haired
cat. Combing may be necessary to remove
heavy tangles. With every lick of the cat’s
tongue hairs are swallowed, and, if done to
excess. hair balls are formed in the intestines
and can be fatal. Except when a cat is
hopelessly soiled, it should never be bathed
and never allowed to become chilled. House-
hold rugs and furniture may be spared if a
cat is provided with a scratching post or
slab or wood in order to wear down its
growing claws.

Safety hints. Cats often get underfoot if
not fed regularly and may cause falls and
injuries to the person involved. Likewise,
hot liquids may be overturned causing severe
burns to the cat. improperly insulated elec-
tric cords can cause severe mouth burns.

Ribbons and collars should not be worn
by cats, for they may become caught on
branches or other projections and could
easily strangle the cat. Cats do not have to
be licensed, and if a collar has to be worn
it should be made largely of elastic so the
head may be pulled out. Never place a
rubber band on any part of a cat for it will
become invisible under the fur and forgotten,
and before long it will cut into the skin and
gangrene will set in.

Pins, needles, thread and string should
always be kept out of reach of a cat.

Always transport a cat in a secure box
or carrier with proper Openings for air, for
a frightened cat can cause accidents.

Empty food jars and cans should never be
left within reach of any animals, for often
they can’t withdraw their heads and are
likely to suffocate.

Poison (rat poisons, insecticides) should
never be placed where any domestic animal
may eat it.

Cats, like all animals, are protected by law
from abuse and suffering or neglect.

It should be remembered that many birds,
like crows and hawks, prey upon songbirds
as well as rodents. Cats do too and should
be kept indoors at night, especially during
the nesting season.

A cat that ﬁnds himself high up in a tree
or pole will eventually come down of itself.

Common ailments. Eczema manifests it-
self by intense itching accompanied by fall-
ing hair and a dry scaly skin. It is not
contagious, and olive oil gives relief. Mild
sulfur preparations may give relief, but a
veterinarian should be consulted.

Mange, an uncommon condition, is caused
by a parasite living deep in the skin, and it
requires veterinary aid. While contagious to
cats, it does not affect humans or dogs.

Ear mites cause accumulation of dark
material in the ear and scratching behind the
ear. They may be eliminated by cleaning
with mineral oil.

Drugs harmful to cats are: paregoric,
morphine, lysol, creolin, sypho-naphthol and
carbolic vaseline.

Use only ﬂea powders labelled safe for
cats, not DDT or benzene hexachloride.

No medicines or skin preparations should
be used without veterinary advice.

Always remember that when your cat or
any other pet is ill, it is safer to consult a
competent veterinarian than to treat the
animal yourself.

Cats should not be picked up or caressed
against their will.

It is best to place one hand under the
animal’s chest, grasping the forelegs gently
with the ﬁngers and supporting the hind
quarters with the other hand. The hind
legs should not be allowed to hang down,
nor should a cat be grasped and lifted by its
forefeet or neck.

Remember a cat likes companionship, but
unlike a dog it is independent and often
indiﬁerent— a creature of moods. It is in-
telligent, useful and devoted, but one has
to understand it to really appreciate it.

A Loyal Friend

THOUGHTLESS or misinformed children
can have many unhappy experiences with
their pets and cause acute suffering to the
animals. Poor care of a pet borders on neg-
lect and cruelty and is a step backward in
character development. This brief leaﬂet on
dogs and two similar leaﬂets on the cat and
the parakeet are designed to help the teacher
give the child the “know-how” on what is
fundamental in kind treatment and proper
care of these pets.

Down through the ages the dog has been
a part of man’s household, helping him in
so many ways, a loyal and affectionate
friend. It has been said no animal reﬂects
its master’s character and disposition so

closely as does a dog. Thus an understand-
ing, well-mannered, friendly dog depends
upon your care, interest and kind treatment.

Sleeping quarters. A dog should have its
own bed made from a box and lined with
newspapers and a clean blanket. The bed
should be kept in the same warm, dry place,
free from drafts. Only dogs with heavy
coats may sleep in an outdoor kennel, and
such dogs should not be kept indoors for
long.

Training. Patience and self-control are
necessary if a puppy is to be housebroken.
Be sure he is taken outdoors after every
meal. This gives him the idea that he should
relieve himself out-of—doors and also gives
him exercise, which is essential for every
dog. Never forget to praise him when he
does well. When he misbehaves scold him.
Under no circumstances scream at or whip
a dog, for it terriﬁes him. Remember, he
wants to please you, but he has to learn
what you want him to do and what he
should not do.

Feeding. Dogs should be fed according to
their age and size. The average two-month-
old puppy’s morning meal consists of 3 to 6
tablespoonfuls milk and 11/2 to 3 tablespoon-
fuls cereal. Noon: 2 to 4 heaping teaspoon-
fuls raw ground meat. Afternoon: repeat
morning feeding. Evening: repeat noon
feeding. Late evening: 3 to 6 tablespoonfuls
milk. 1/2 to 1 teaspoonfuls cod-liver oil once
a day. As the puppy grows gradually in-
crease amounts per feeding, including
cooked mashed vegetable with evening meal,
and gradually eliminate afternoon and late

 




evening feeding. Finally at age twelve
months a dog weighing 15 to 20 lbs. needs
but one meal: % to 1% cups of meat, 3%: to
1% cups cereal, % to 1% cups vegetables
or table scraps, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls cod-liver
oil twice a day until warm weather. Chop
and chicken bones should never be fed to a
dog. Canned dog foods may be substituted
for meat. Avoid cake and candy. A bowl
of fresh drinking water should be kept near
the dog’s own feeding bowl.

Grooming. Combing and brushing the
dog’s hair regularly is better than too fre—
quent bathing which destroys the natural
oils. It is not advisable to-bathe a puppy,
but, if it is absolutely necessary, be sure that
after the bath he is dried thoroughly and
kept warm and out of drafts. In bathing
your dog talk to him, and pour the luke-
warm water from the tub over him gently
until he is wet. Lather him with some plain

”.2535 My};
‘ {gfmn

white soap, taking care not to get water in
his eyes or ears. Rinse the soap out thor-
oughly. Be sure he is rubbed dry and not
allowed outdoors for several hours, lest he
catch “cold.”

Flea powder thoroughly dusted on the dog
and disposal of used bedding will rid him of
ﬂeas. Lice and their eggs must be eliminated
with a ﬁne-tooth comb. Then give the dog
a bath and rub a solution of benzene-
hexachloride on the skin and allow it to re-
main ten minutes. Follow this by another
bath. Examine your dog during the summer
for ticks which must be removed with tweez-
ers and the wounded area sterilized with a
disinfectant. Alcohol or ether may be ap-
plied to the body of the tick to loosen its

grasp on the skin before removing it with
tweezers. Be sure all the mouth parts of the
tick have been removed.

Common ailments. Don’t treat any case
of illness without veterinary advice. Most
so—called “colds” are due to distemper, to
which puppies are very susceptible. Dis-
temper immunization may be commenced at
the age of six weeks, and, while not 100
per cent effective, it is recommended by vet-
erinarians. “Booster” inoculations should be
given whenever the dog is to be hospitalized
or boarded or taken to a dog show.

Internal parasites, called worms, require
veterinary diagnosis and treatment. Don’t
treat them yourself with worm medicine.

For simple cuts and wounds, the hair
should be cut away and the wound washed
with boric acid solution. Then apply a pad
of gauze soaked with the solution and secure
with a bandage if necessary.

Burns of the skin should be annointed
with either lard, butter, vaseline or olive oil.

Miscellaneous facts. Adult dogs should
not be lifted except in emergency. Too
much handling is bad. A dog is not a toy.
To pick up a puppy it is best to place one
hand under the animal’s chest, grasping the
forelegs gently with the ﬁngers and sup—
porting the hind quarters with the other
hand. The hind legs should not be allowed
to hang down, nor should a puppy be
grasped and lifted by its forefeet.

Many agree that a dog should be taken
to a veterinarian to be spayed at the age of
eight or ten months, for it has many advan-
tages.

Dogs must be licensed at three months of
age. Stray dogs should be fed and conﬁned
and reported to a humane society or dog
ofﬁcer. If the owner is not found within
six days the ﬁnder may claim the dog.

Never tie up a puppy, and a grown dog
should not be chained for long.

Dogs should be taught simple commands
by regular training of about ten minutes
duration daily. Be patient and praise him
as he makes progress. Training will make
your dog a good neighbor and teach him
not to run out in the street where he may be
struck by an automobile.

The schoolyard with its excitement is no
place for a dog. Keep him home.

Helping children to understand and ap—
preciate their pets will also help to develop
kindness and consideration which are vital
parts of their learning experience.

and other information regarding animals
will be gladly supplied upon application to

Dear Mr. Levin,

I'm returning a reply to your May 1st letter in the hope it may

not be too late. We have been so rushed with a heavy legislative
schedule involving critical animal issue plus preparation for
Christine Stevens' trip to London as an observer at the Internatinnal
Whaling Commission that we have fallen behind. Ih the future when

I circularixe something for staff comment, I'll hand—carry it.

Our priority question is:
How do students think of pain and cruelty in relation to the
tregtment of animals in laboratories and in research?

Our second question:
How do students feel about exploitation of the land at the
risk of making animal and plant species extinct?

I do apologize for this tradiness and hope these thoughts may be of
use to you and your editors in your provocative work. I should
imagine you will want to word the multiple choice answers yourselves.

Sincerely,

John Gleiber
Assistant to the Officers

Dear Christine:

It is once again time to structure our 9th Student National Opinion
Survey for 1977-78. This poll provides a unique opportunity to
monitor the attitudes and opinions of WHO'S WHO Students — the pot—
ential leaders of tomorrow — about issues of today. Each year the
survey receives wide national acclaim. It is distributed to the
President of the United States, all United States Senators, Con—
gressmen, Governors, key educators and the press.

The entire activity of the Student National Opinion Survey is funded
by Educational Communications, Inc. and is one of our public service
activities.

 

I have previously discussed with many contributing editors the oppor—
tunity to include questions about their specific areas of interest
in this edition of the survey. If this is of interest to you, you
are invited to submit two questions for possible inclusion. We
will make every effort to use at least one.“ If you have a strong
; preference as to which of the two questions you would favor, please
indicate.

 
    
   
  

Please submit your questions by June 1,1978 as we would like to
discuss them with our Board of Sfﬁdent Advisors, whose responsibility
it is to assist in choosing the questions to be used in the survey.

I am including last year's questionnaire for your reference and will
welcome hearing from you if further information is necessary.

    
   
    
     
 

Sincerely yours,

ow Cruelty
ﬂat/ms Chile/yen

By DR. JAMES TWYFORD MEHORTER

Associate Professor of Psychology, Montclair State College,
Upper Montclair, New Jersey“

I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak to members and friends of

The Humane Society of the United States on the problem of how children
can be harmed by the cruel use of animals in schools. It is a subject very
closely related to one of my chief interests, which is mental health education.
But what is more, it is a subject almost totally unexplored by behavioral
scientists.

For some time now I have been interested in the psychological effects
of the American school program upon the developing youngster. l have been
interested in the inﬂuences which curriculum experiences exert upon per-
sonality and behavior, and the extent to which they conduce positively
toward good mental health. Accordingly, present trends in educational

theory and practice lead me to question the psychologically positive aspects
of certain aspects of modern education.

By and large, the American school is still predicated upon the Victorian
concept of faculty psycholog’. That is to say, it is the assumption of a
sizable number of people that. the primary function of the school is, in the
ﬁnal. analysis, sheer intellectual exercise. Such outspoken critics of education
as Admiral Rickover, Arthur Bestor, Robert Hutchins, and others would
have us adhere more strictly to this cognitive or intellectualistic point of
view. Unhappily, these articulate critics evince a serious lack of psycho-
logical training, and, moreover, the knowledge that human intellective per-
formance is not merely influenced by but utterly dependent upon the affective
and conative dimensions of personality. Affectivity refers to feeling, emotion,
and mood, while conation refers to desire, impulse, and volition. It is axio-
matic in educational psychology that an individual’s academic performance

* This is an extensiOn. of remarks at the 1.959 annual meeting of The Humane Society of the
United States.

 




 

is contingent upon his psychological orientation; that intellectual achieve-
ment is interrelated with, and often the result of, emotional and motivational
processes, not to mention biochemical variables. In a word, cognition, affec-
tivity, and conation are intrinsically one and the same thing. The “intellectual
man” per se simply does not exist.

One would think that with the tremendous scientiﬁc advancements of
the age, especially the signiﬁcant accomplishments of the behavioral sciences,
American education would be providing curriculum experiences for young-
sters which would tend to facilitate psychological maturity and, hence, in-
tellectual, emotional, and social development. Actually and oddly enough,
the reverse seems to be more nearly the case.

By way of illustration, Soviet Russia’s impressive scientific feats tend
to have not only frightened but regressed many of us to believe that in
order to meet their formidable challenge it is necessary to train (“educate”
is a misnomer) our youth on comparable terms. which, when distilled, is
faculty psychology all over again but now with an equally archaic, Pavlovian
twist. The threat of Russia in the sphere of science gave grist to those edu-
cational reactionaries who had been repulsed by the “visceral” whole-child
concept, its scientiﬁc validity notwithstanding, and who wanted to “re-
intellectualize” the school curriculum in accord with the Victorian modality.
Paradoxically, they found a convenient avenue of approach within the
scientiﬁc excitement engendered largely by World War II and growing
steadily to permeate the texture of the times. “Science education” had become
the rage; and since it was a “cerebral” sort of discipline, it served a very
useful purpose in putting the school curriculum in its “proper” perspective.
However, modern science had some gray areas in her cerebellum, and had
brought some dubious guests with her . . .

Mid-twentieth century man, through really no conscious or deliberate
effort of his own, has been suddenly thrust into a new era—or better, new
dimension—which he does not fully understand and to which he cannot
fully adjust. The great technological and industrial advancements of the
century seem to have exceeded his adaptability. And in the past forty-two
years man has been afﬂicted by three global wars of enormous devastation;
while at present he views the ominous clouds of an all-destroying fourth
hovering about the horizon. The human race has ﬁnally learned how to
destroy itself, utterly and scientiﬁcally; and the awareness of this fact has
resulted in a kind of universal anxiety in which the personal existence of
the individual becomes more seriously threatened than perhaps at any other
time in history. Indeed, we are of the “age of anxiety,” and the causal
agent, modern science, is both feared and worshipped. It is addressed as
Shelley addressed the west wind: “Destroyer and preserver, hear oh hear!”

2

 

 




Hence science has become a kind of god, a father-ﬁgure who both punishes
and rewards, who must be both feared and loved. The historic paradox . . .

Correspondingly, one would think that in tune with the impressive
advancements in the behavioral sciences, the American school would be
according greater priority to psychological development and to cultivating
the affective dimension of personality, particularly the integrative emotions
of love, empathy, compassion, etc. Surely the terrible wars of the times,
the seemingly endless examples of man’s inhumanity to man, had ﬁnally
persuaded us that the disintegrative emotions of hostility, aggression, preju-
dice, etc., lead but to despair, chaos, and death, and consequently should
be countered by appropriate educative experience. But once again, the
reverse is more nearly the case. The emphasis of the school remains upon
the promotion of behavior which is competitive, aggressive, and intellectual-
istic—behavior which tends to conduce toward mental ill-health. A humanistic
or adjustive emphasis is doubtless too “impracticable” for the masculine
world of pragmatism.

The American school, then, has modiﬁed its curriculum in
order to escalate science education. Noticeable acceleration is
seen in the biological and physical sciences, in which emulation of
college-level instruction, even medical college instruction, is in-
creasingly manifest. And with regard to the area of the biological
sciences, I—yet standing within the domain of the behavioral
sciences—have become uncomfortably aware of a potentially, if
not actually, dangerous type of instruction, namely the use of
animals in public school classrooms for so-callec “experimental”
purposes.

The headquarters staff of The Humane Society of the United States has,
upon my request, supplied me with literally hundreds of pages of documented
data dealing expressly with instances of gross animal cruelties in the school.
To even begin to compile a list of these cruelties would be a gigantic chore
insofar as they continue to pour into Washington every day.

To cite but one example, The Suburban and Wayne Times of Wayne,
Pennsylvania, reported this past July that the local high school, Radnor
High, would continue its “research” into the eflects of high-voltage radiation
on mice—which refers speciﬁcally to deliberate damage to the tissues and
organs of these animals. Last year the students were instructed to destroy
all of the mice and remove their livers, spleens, intestines, and gonads for
“examination.”

Moreover, I was surprised to learn that the National Science Teachers
Association, a department of the N.E.A., published and ostensibly endorsed

3

 




 

 

of hostile behavior. Signiﬁcantly, the parallel seems to stem from the same
psychological principle: sustained, disintegrative emotional experience, in
which the child inﬂicts cruelty or when he observes it being inﬂicted, under
conditions of avowed justification by an external authority, tends to foster
disintegrative emotional response, retard moral development, and conse-
quently result in anti-social behaviors.

This is another way of suggesting that if a child is taught to treat
animals cruelly or regard their suffering with indifference, he will tend to
project and generalize such treatment and regard toward and onto human
beings progressively as he grows older. It is known, for example, that a
child tends to identify with an animal to a much greater degree than adults
do. Further, the child does not perceive the differential between man and
beast so distinctly as do adults. 50 in many respects the family dog, for
example, is simply another playmate, brother or sister. Therefore, it is not
too very difficult to see Why a child would project his attitudes and feelings
toward animals onto people.

It is noteworthy that in most studies dealing with the criteria of positive
mental health, the factor of love is touched upon time after time. Frequently

77 46

it is referred to by other names, such as “emphatic involvement, relating
outward on affectionate terms,” etc. But it is now generally agreed by be-
havioral scientists that a cardinal criterion of good mental health is the
individual’s ability to love beyond himself with compassion, empathy, and
concern for all sentient life. It is akin to what Albert Schweitzer has been
trying to tell us in his concept of “reverence for life.” Needless to say,

this has enormous relevance to the education of our children.

I would merely ask: to what extent do we strive to provide children
with experiences in loving? Indeed, to what extent does the American school
strive to provide its students with an education of compassionate concern
for the existence of all forms of life? To what extent does “humane edu-
cation” share equal status with science education? Are they antithetical
and therefore mutually exclusive? Perhaps someday researchers will focus
down on some of these pressing questions.

Actually, the schools are doing dreadfully little to foster the development
of the affective and conative dimensions of personality. They are concerned
predominantly with the cognitive domain—which is self-defeating from the
start, contradictory—necessarily limiting their efficacy in promoting intellec-
tual growth, since they are persuaded that it is the child’s “mind” that goes
to school and which they must reckon with chieﬂy.

There is, then, a paucity of effort expended by the school in
not only providing curriculum experiences in reference to this

6

 

 

 




criterion of love speciﬁcally but in providing relevant experiences
in reference to virtually all other criteria of mental health gen-
erally. There is a battle yet to be bitterly waged in the cause of
mental health education. The cruel use of animals in schools for
“experimentation” is a case in point which serves to underscore
this need.

In closing, I would like to propose that the membership of The Humane
Society of the United States adopt—as a resolution~the following statement,
which I endorse personally and professionally:

We believe that the inculcation and perpetuation of good atti-
tudes are as Vital to the survival of our culture as the transmission
of knowledge. Desired ingredients of our culture include satisfactory
human relations and application of humane principles. Nothing
should enter the curriculum of our schools that tends to destroy or
weaken empathy of children for other living things.

In this connection we are concerned about the spreading
practice of including painful so-called experiments on animals in
the classroom work of elementary and secondary schools. Such
misuse of animals is bad pedagogy because it gives young students
an artiﬁcial picture of the seriousness, difficulty and responsibility
of animal experimentation and of the very nature of science. These
“experiments” produce no new knowledge and are, therefore, need-
less cruelties.

Further, cruelty to animals under the auspices of schools in-
evitably has undesirable psychological effects on children. Under
no conditions can we afford to condition our children to apathy
and indifference toward any form of pain or suffering. A person
without pity is not a healthy human being.

We recommend that all painful uses of animals in elementary
and secondary schools be avoided.

joined together in this poster
to tell you that kindness counts.

This year, there were many
wonderful posters entered in
our International Animals in
Art Poster Contest. We would
like to show you all of the POS-
ters in JUNIOR HUMANE
NEWS, but since that can’t be
done, some of the better slogans
from this year’s posters are
listed below - perhaps you
would. like to draw a poster to
match the slogans:

-- Have a heart - kindness
counts

Security is knowing you are
needed.

Make it a point to be kind.
Love - the extra touch.
Kindness means care.
Growing for kindness.

This little fellow travels by magic carpet.
He has extra flaps of skin that reach from
the sides of his back, down his legs, to wrists
and ankles. His whole body, including the
side ﬂaps is covered with thick, silky fur and
he wears a wide fluffy tail. Altogether, he
weighs only a few ounces and, from his nose
to the tip of his furry tail, he measures only
one foot.

He is called a ﬂyer, but he is actually a
glider. The magic carpet on which he glides
is made from his own little body. The glide
begins from the top of a tree, usually an
alder or a beech tree. When he’s set to go,
he leaps off into space, spreading his legs
out sideways. He is now a small flying
mat or carpet. The furry tail helps to
steer him.

All day long he sleeps in the top of a
leafy tree. At night he joins a group of
friends. They are very playful creatures
and love to play follow the leader. They
take off from a treetop, one after another.
And, one after another, they land at the
base of another tree. Part of this is play,
but part of it is also a serious hunt for
nuts, berries, and insects.

SNAKES

While a few boys and fewer girls keep
snakes as pets, most children should not.
Snakes have very special needs, and some
are dangerous. However, they are very
interesting animals, and are helpful to far-
mers in controlling rodents.

Snakes are reptiles. They are cold
blooded, which means their body temper-
ature changes with the temperature around
them. If you live where the wintersget cold,
you probably never see a snake in the
winter, because they hibernate.

Baby snakes hatch fromeggs. Some
snakes lay their eggs as birds and turtles
do, while other kinds of female snakes
carry their eggs inside their bodies until
they hatch. These baby snakes are said
to be born alive.

Snakes do not have legs or feet. But
they do have a backbone extending from
the skull to the tip of the tail. All along the
body are strong muscles which help the
snake to move easily on ground or in water.
Its skin is covered with scales, which grip the
ground and help it move.

Snakes sleep with their eyes open be’Cause
they have no eyelids. They have ears but
you can’t see them. Snakes havelong forked
tongues, which they move in and out very
fast to taste and smell the air. This is one
way snakes hunt food.

Snakes eat small animals such as frogs,
mice, moles, worms and insects. They have
special hinge jaws so that their mouths open
very wide. They do not 'chew their food,
but swallow it whole. Usually one big meal
a week is all they need.

Snakes live in all parts of the world.
Some are small, like the blind snake, which
is less than a foot long, and some are large,
like the giant anaconda, Which may be over
20 feet long when fully grown.

I have a dog. His name is Duke. He
is 2 years old. He likes the snow very
much. At times the dog and I play. When
I am lonely he keeps me company. He is
very smart. If you ask him to do anything
he will listen. Dogs have very sharp ears.
If he hears anything he will start to bark.
But he is a friendly dog. I love him very
much.

Willing Workers, by Gordon Carter
Abelard Schuman, Publisher

Boys and girls who admire dogs will es-
pecially enjoy this book. Willing Workers
is the story of training guide dogs for
the blind.

The book describes the work of the pio-
neers and the people today who work to
train dogs to be "eyes” for blind people.

The book has many photographs of
dogs, trainers, and blind masters with their
dogs, as well as a fascinating section of true
stories about guide dogs and how they have
shown extreme intelligence.

The tiger is one of the largest members
of the cat family. It compares with the
lion in size and strength. A full-grown
Bengal tiger is about nine feet long from
the tip of its nose to the tip of its tail,
and may weigh up to 400 pounds. The
larger Siberian tiger grows to 13 feet in
length and weighs over 650 pounds.

Tigers are found only in Asia, mostly
in India and the Malay Peninsula where
it is warm. A few tigers, however, like
the colder climates. Siberian tigers live
in an area where the temperature often
drops to 70 degrees below zero.

Since lions are found today only in
Africa, the lion and tiger never meet
except in zoos or circuses. Actually, they
are close cousins in the animal family
and can become very friendly.

The tiger is powerful and dangerous.
It runs at tremendous speed and can leap

15 feet in a single bound. The tiger is
a good swimmer. It can climb trees,
which the lion cannot do.

Normally tigers prey on other wild
animals, such as buffalo, deer, antelope,
and wild pigs. But sometimes they
attack farm animals, and then they
become a nuisance. Occasionally a tiger,
generally an older one, will become
known as a man—killer. Such a tiger
must be tracked down and killed by
professional hunters.

Tigers usually have two to four babies
at a time. These kittens weigh only two
or three pounds at birth. They are very
playful. The mother, called a tigress,
watches over them with great care and
tenderness. They stay with her for a
year or two. Most tigers are tawny
yellow with black stripes. At times a
completely black or all white tiger is
born.

Maltese

One of the smallest breeds of dog is
the Maltese. These dogs seldom weigh
over six or seven pounds. Although
small in size, they have a long history.
Records about them go back 2,800 years.

The Maltese dogs spent their early -
days on the Mediterranean Island of
Malta, which was made famous for its
wealth by the sea-going Phoenicians. It
is quite likely that Phoenician sailors
carried these dogs to many countries.

Maltese pets were popular in Ancient
Rome. The Latin poet, Martial, wrote
about them. Artists painted pictures of
them. Years later, the Maltese was ‘
favored as a pet in England at the time .
of the ﬁrst Queen Elizabeth. With its
silky, white hair and snappy, dark eyes,
the Maltese still is a popular pet.

Praying Mantis

Distantly related to the grasshoppers are the
family of mantids. There are a number of
different types of mantids which are native to
the United States, but most of these live in the
southern part of the country. Few of these native
mantidsventure as far north as Ohio or New
Jersey.

Actually, the best known mantid in this
country is the Oriental Mantis which was
imported from across the Paciﬁc. They were
brought here in the 1890’s in the hope that they
would destroy and control other insects.

,_ Because they attack other insects, these
Oriental mantids were called “preying mantises.”
Later, because of the unusual attitude they often
assume, these creatures came to be called
“praying mantises.”

A praying mantis can be kept as a pet. Two
cannot be kept together, however, as they would

ﬁght. A mantis can be fed on insects, pieces of
raw beef, apple, potato or other raw vegetables.
It will learn to eat from your ﬁngers and to sip
’Water from a spoon. It will cock its little head
, Expectantly as you approach with food.

FARM CATS

Most farms and ranches have several cats who are
working "hands.” Cats are the supreme catchers of
mice and rats. Each year, farm cats save their owners

millions of dollars worth of food that would have been
destroyed by rodents.

Westport Town Crier and Herald Photo

Richard [osepla and Vicky, the Basset puppy, bit-and-run victim.

This moving document is a real letter, written by Mr. Joseph to the Westport,
Connecticut “Town Crier and Herald,” when his dog, Vicky, was run down
and killed by a hit-and-run driver.

HOPE you were going some place

important when you drove so fast

down Cross Highway across Bay-
berry Lane, Tuesday night.

1 hope that when you got there the
time you saved by speeding meant some-
thing to you or somebody else.

Maybe we’d feel better if we could
imagine that you were a doctor rushing
somewhere to deliver a baby or ease
somebody’s pain. The life of our dog
to shorten someone’s suffering—that
mightn’t have been so bad.

But even though all we saw of you
was your car’s black shadow and its
jumping tail lights as you roared down
the road, we know too much about you
to believe it.

You saw the dog, you stepped on
your brakes, you felt a thump, you heard
a yelp and then my wife’s scream. Your
reﬂexes are good, we know, because you
jumped on the gas again and got out
of there fast.

Whoever you are, mister, and what-
ever you do for a living, we know you
are a killer.

And in your hands, driving the way
yOu drove Tuesday night, your car is a
murder weapon.

You didn’t bother to look, so I’ll
tell you what the thump and the yelp
were. They were Vicky, a six-months-
old Basset puppy; white, with brown

and black markings. An aristocrat, with
twelve champions among her forebears;
but she clowned and she chased, and
she loved people and kids and other
dogs as much as any mongrel on earth.

I’m sorry you didn’t stick around to
see the job you did, though a dog dying
by the side of the road isn’t a very
pretty sight. In less than two seconds
you and that car of yours transformed
a living being that had been beautiful,
warm, white, clean, soft and loving
into something dirty, ugly, broken and
bloody. A poor, shocked and mad thing
that tried to sink its teeth into the hand

it had nuzzled and licked all its life.

I hope to God that when you hit
my dog you had for a moment the
sick, dead feeling in the throat and
down to the stomach that we have
known ever since. And that you feel
it whenever you think about speeding
down a winding country road again.

Because the next time some eight-
year-old boy might be wobbling along
on his ﬁrst bicycle. Or a very little
one might wander out past the gate
and into the road in the moment it
takes his father to bend down to pull
a weed out of the driveway, the way
my puppy got away from me.

Or maybe you’ll be real lucky again,
and only'kill another dog, and break
the heart of another family.

Aspects

humane
education

Dr. Ellsworth’s thoughts on a plan for humane education in the
schools were a’ valuable addition to the AHA convention program
in Grand Rapids

AM delighted to be with you and
I I want to assure you ﬁrst that your

invitation to come and talk with
you about a plan for humane education
in the schools was one of the most heart-
warming things that has happened to me
in a long time.

It has seemed in the past that so fre-
quently groups of people who have been
concerned about a program of education
in the schools have attempted to go at
such a program rather separately and
then have asked the schools to- adopt a
program which has been worked out
without too much cooperation with
school people. It is a real pleasure for
educators who are working on the cur-
riculums of our schools to work with a
group of people in trying to think
through some of the important aspects
of such a program in the planning stage.

I wish to congratulate you upon your
concern that a program of humane edu-
cation in the schools be integrated into
the total school curriculum. That was
the comment that was made to me and it
was with that understanding that I was

Page 24

to try to formulate my thoughts about a
plan for humane education in the
schools. I know from your planning and
from your asking that you want to con-
sider a plan which is integrated into the
total school curriculum—that you have
an understanding of how people learn.
Because they do learn when what yOu
have to share about humane education
is made part of everything that the chil-
dren do which involves animals, rather
than being considered a separate subject
which is to be taught so many minutes a
day or so many minutes a week by itself.

Children in our schools do not learn
as well from an isolated block of subject
matter which is presented to them
separately as they do when all that your
association can give to them is made a
part of all the experiences that they have.

I want to talk about some of the things
that children do in school and where it
seems to me principles of humane educa-
tion can function. Children learn all
that they do, all that they live, all that
they think, all of that that they are a part
of, really. We have come to believe and

 

understand more fully": 'I thin‘ﬂ', each year
that the way to help them is by right
concepts and attitudes and patterns of
behavior—and to- help them live each
day to the fullest and to live each day
the best they can. That means that every
day in whatever contacts they have with
animals, whatever experiences they have
in their schools and out, they are learn-
ing good behavior or bad behavior . . .
they are learning that behavior.

80 it is essential that you people and
teachers and parents try to, insofar as
possible, encourage children to engage in
good behavior, in humane behavior and
kindness to animals, as well as to people.

THE interest in animals is already

present in children, as you know. So
there is no job of doing what we some-
times refer to as motivating children to
an interest in animals. It is just a part
of all children. They love animals—they
want to have them for pets and play-
mates and friends, and so they are highly
motivated to learn about them and to
seek out experiences of playing with
them and in working with them, and in
studying animals. They like animals be-
cause they are a source of affection for
themselves. They like them because pets
usually make children feel important.
They love them, they follow them around
and they do what they are asked to do.
They are good for children to be with
for both of these reasons and for an-
other reason.

Animals are, to an extent, dependent
for care; and because they are dependent
for care, children have an opportunity to
learn responsibility in caring for them.
That is one reason that we frequently
seek to have animals in school with
children because they can learn so much
about taking responsibility for the care
of the animals, and responsibility for
looking after other people, as well as
animals, around them.

I would like to say, primarily, that
animal culture and kindness are the
principles of humane education and they
should be taught as they function in the
things children do every day in school.
It seems to me that a plan for an organi-
zation such as this should include clar-
ifying, ﬁrst of all, the objectives which
you people have in humane education in
the schools. You probably have already
done that and I regret that I have not

By way of introduction,I‘m the male half of the “Pet Frogramg"A few

Kindness and Humane Education
EDNA L. APEL

HE keynote of Humane Education is kindness.
With large areas of the world reverting to Medieval and

well-nigh savage indifference to suffering and human values, we
need the high ideals of Humane Education as never before.

The far-sighted place to begin this education is with children,
the custodians of future eras. There is no better medium than
the animal pet; a stuffed toy for the very young child and a real
live animal when he has been prepared to handle and care for
it properly. ’

Parents often thoughtlessly foster cruelty in the cradle by
giving a very little child a live animal pet to play with. His ﬁrst
impulse is to squeeze the soft little body in his grasp. If the ani-
mal retaliates, which it will to protect itself from further recur-
rence of this painful feeling, the child is going to be hurt and
frightened. This fright and pain may mean the beginning of a
life-long fear of animals, a tragedy for any child.

In other words, he should not be given a live pet until he has
learned through experience, and come in contact with pain and
what it means to be hurt. Then only can he understand. So a
stuffed toy pet is safer and decidedly more sane, both from the
child’s and the animal’s standpoint, as an early medium of play.

Granted, the child is given toy animals. How often we see
Mother beating the Hobby Horse to make it go; how often the
Teddy Bear is spanked to amuse baby; how often any toy is pun-
ished and blamed because it hurt Baby.




 

What can we expecr of the child when it grows up, save that
it will revenge itself upon anybody who annoys it by physical
chastisement. The boy, who has been educated to beat his Hobby
Horse will grow to molest a real animal, no doubt; quarrel with
and hit other children; steer his automobile ruthlessly, disregard-
ing life on the highways. The persons who love the child most
are the ones who are often starting him on life’s road with a
handicap, a handicap of selﬁshness and unkindness.

, These inanimate toys can be made the basis for a training of
all the worth-while attitudes of life, for through them the child
can be taught to be good to his toys, to give them love and kind
usage, and tender handling, as a preparation.

A child so trained will never forget consideration and kind-
ness. When he is old enough to be entrusted with a live pet, he
will enjoy the deep devotion and loyalty that can exist between
him as the careful little master and his animal friend.

His responsibility in the home can be pleasantly taught through
the routine of feeding and caring for his pet.

Consideration is learned through playing with the little crea-
ture and knowing that it gets tired and must have rest and sleep,
like the baby in the family, if it is going to grow up to be a
strong, healthy, and good puppy. The little pet will not have

cause to be afraid of his human companion.

One of the beautiful things in childhood is the dog conﬁdant,
to whom the child cries out his sorrows and secrets, and joys.
The beautiful mystery, friendship, and love of animals is an ex-
perience of understanding no child or grown-up should miss in
life. It is worth while, for the kindness the child learns in this
way carries over in his relationship with other children and the
people he comes in contact with as he grows older, when he, him-
self, becomes a nucleus for inspiring kindness.




Parents owe it to their children to guide and guard the disposi-
tion of their animal playmates. The puppy that never ex-
periences cruelty and malicious teasing, is not going to bite
promiscuously. On the other hand, if he is mistreated, and wails
in helpless pain, sooner or later he is going to learn that through
his jaws, his only weapon, he can prOtect himself. F irsr, he snaps,
to make his molester let him alone. Then, if this is not effective,
he will bite. Thus he has developed from a kindly trusting little
puppy into a cross and, perhaps, vicious animal, all of which
could have been avoided. These little dumb creatures, too, are
born, perhaps with rare exceptions, docile and inoffensive. The
animal pet can become one of the greatest factors in character
building it is possible. to attain, because the love of animals is
a ready-made avenue of approach to a child’s heart.

The world is full of cruelty. Recent statistics show that every
person in the United States is forced to pay twenty-ﬁve cents out
of every dollar he earns as a tribute to the 4,000,000 criminals
who commit a murder every forty-ﬁve minutes, and a major
crime every twenty minutes, the greatest number of offenders
nineteen years of age.

The warden of the Connecticut State Prison once said: “If a
child is properly educated to the age of ten in the ways of kind-
ness, no matter what its inheritance, it never becomes a criminal.”

We parents and teachers must jealously guard our boys and
girls in the ways of kindness. Children are great imitators. They
naturally look up to their elders and have a trusting faith in that
what they do must be right. This offers a real challenge to us,
who must radiate kindness if we are going to get kindly results

 




with the children in our sphere. We owe it to them to watch
the ethics of our moving pictures, our entertainment committees
in schools, churches, and clubs.

The humane societies are primarily interested in the prevention
of cruelty to children, old people, and animals, who are those
most offended against.

The Humane Education Committee of the Congress of Parents
and Teachers is interested primarily in what cruelty does to the
child, the adverse mental reaction that is created. Therefore,
we must curb the slightest tendency to cruelty.

Kindness and the Golden Rule of doing unto others as we
would be done by is the surest method. Kindness is contagious.
It springs from the heart.

Through HMane Education we must enrich children’s lives
with these high ideals of compassion, and love, and justice for

lesser and weaker creatures, that they may grow into men and
women who will have caught the spirit of Kindness in a wider,
deeper humanity.

Gentlemen:

I'm preparing an article for the AMERICAN GIRL
(the Girl Scout magazine) on choosing a pet, and
I'd like to have any informative material you
put out on pets and pet care. I'm interested in
all animals (including birds and fish) that can
be brought up in the home , from the run-of-the
mill to the exotic.

At the end of the article I'm planning to append
a list of literature that the girls can write
for, so I'd appreciate knowing which of the book-
lets are available to the girls themselves, and
the COSt, if any.

is I'm working on a very short deadline, I'd ap—
pre ciate hearing from you at your earliest con-
venience.

Thank you for your courtesy.

Sincerely yours ,

 




Mrs. Hugh John Flemming, the founder of the Kindness Club, with members and pets.

THE KINDNESS CLUB? AW

FREDA DEWSON (LC-“(V <5

A Progress Repor

N AN ARTICLE published in this maga-

zine just two years ago, the Kindness

Club was launched. Since that time it
has attracted attention on four continents,
and hundreds of branches have been
formed in Canada and in the United
States, a few in Britain and New Zealand,
with inquiries coming in from Africa and
India.

Why this rapid spread of a club meant
originally for the children of Fredericton ?
The answer must be that the children
themselves want it. “Out came the chil—
dren running” when they heard the magic
music in the word—kindness. “The minute
I heard the name, I wanted to join," one
little boy said. Adults who have had the
happy experience of helping children form
a Kindness Club ﬁnd it easy to agree with
the ﬁndings of a recent survey made by
the University of Illinois which states that
the average child’s most basic interest is
in animals, and not in sport, recreation,
machines or applied science as many
parents and teachers suppose.

For this natural interest children take
in animals, the Kindness Club provides
an ideal outlet. They like the way it is
organized with each Branch taking the
name of a bird or an animal, and the
adult adviser being known as the Racoon
Captain. At meetings, they like to be
addressed as Beaver Bill or Chipmunk
Cathy, or whatever it may be, as each
member is called by his Christian name
preﬁxed by the name of his Branch. Rules
for the club have been carefully formulated
so as to give members all the responsibility
they will take; to encourage them to adopt
a local project which will help animals
and birds; and incidentally, to teach them
how properly to conduct a meeting.

The prayer of the Kindness Club is:

Dear Father, hear and bless
Thy beasts and singing birds
And guard with tenderness
Small things that have no words.

Its pledge is: I promise to be kind to
animals (as well as people) and to speak

and act in defence. of all helpless living
creatures.

The motto is: Be Kind!

To become a member, each child signs
the above pledge, and sells one packet of
Kindness Club hasti-notes or Christmas
cards, which sell twelve for sixty-nine
cents in a cellophane-wrapped package.
The purpose of selling Kindness Cards is
twofold: in the ﬁrst place, sales help pay
for supplies, which are numerous, ex—
pensive (though printed without proﬁt),
and all free to members; and secondly,
every card sent by anyone, anywhere,
helps spread the gospel of kindness.

The purpose of the Club is to induce
children (and grown-ups) to think about
being kind to every creature that lives
and suffers just as we do; and to ﬁnd out
how to be kind by learning everything
possible about the needs and natures of
animals and birds. For it is certainly true
that a great deal of cruelty is due to
thoughtlessness and ignorance. Club ac-

tivities cultivate in members habits of
kindness by constantly providing them
with Opportunities to do kind things. The
Kindness Club is the positive approach
to the prevention of cruelty. Its method
is humane education.

What exactly is humane education? It
is the “impressing on the receptive minds
of boys and girls those principles of love,
compassion and kindness on which the
security and permanence of civilized so-
ciety depend.” May it not be because we
have not been giving highest priority in
our homes, our churches and our schools
to humane education that we are now
being threatened with the wiping out of
all civilized life on earth?

Perhaps there is still time. Senator F. A.
McGrand, president of the Federated
Humane Societies of Canada, says: “The
_ Creator placed man on earth as His
steward to administer this earthly domain
with reason, justice and mercy. And now
at long last, in this hazardous atomic age,
is man beginning to realize that, ulti—
mately, there can be no respect for human
life if there is no respect for life itself?”

There is increasing general uneasiness
that in some schools today a programme
is being conducted at great expense to
the taxpayer in education for delinquency.
For this reason, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt
recently wrote as follows to the president
of the National Parent-Teachers’ Associa—
tion in the United States: “I would like
to join with those who sympathize with
the principles of humane education and
urge you to include a discussion on this
vital matter and reinstate humane educa-
tion on the programme of the P.T.A. .It
seems to me of greatest importance to
teach our children respect for life. Toward
this end, experiments on living animals in
classrooms should be stopped. To en-
courage cruelty—in the name of science——
can only destroy the ﬁner emotions of
affection and sympathy and breed an un—
feeling callousness in the young toward
suffering in all living creatures.”

On the other hand, encouraging chil-
dren to think about being kind and to do
kind things is bound to make them hap—
pier—and betterwhuman beings. Already
there have been many speciﬁc instances
of children considered delinquents whose
outlook has been changed through mem-
bership in the Kindness Club. Such young
people are helped by being accepted as
part of a group, and quickly learn from
other members that it is the bully who is
the coward, and the kind boy or girl
willing to stand up for the helpless, who
is truly courageous and worthy of ad-
miration.

When the Kindness Club was founded
it was hoped that funds from card sales
would make it possible to put full-time
humane education workers in the ﬁeld
available at all times to visit groups of
children in schools, youth organizations,

and playgrounds, to organize projects
which would inculcate habits of kindness
and, at the same time, be educational and
entertaining. This project is still far from
fulﬁlment as card sales do not as yet begin
to pay for club supplies, let alone salaries
for ﬁeld workers.

The ideal, of course, is to have teachers
whose hearts are in humane education
visiting classrooms regularly as an integral
part of the school system. In the meantime,
we have an excellent example of a co—
operative effort between the schools and
the SPCA. in Hamilton, Ontario, where
Miss Evelyn Burgess, educational secre—
tary of the S.P.C.A., carries on a wonder-
ful programme for the students. She
writes: “Again this year, we have over
30,000 Junior Humane members . . . This
year in the schools, my talks have been
used as tests for essays right through the
grades and one Inspector was amazed at
the amount the kiddies in the kinder-
garten retained. There is a poster contest
going on now and the children’s general
interest in the prevention of cruelty is
high . . . I am amazed at the general
apathy (among adults) about a subject
which I consider the very ﬁnest for
character building.”

The racoon is the emblem of the kindness
Club

A few comments of the Kindness Club
give some idea of how it is being received
by a variety of people. The Humane
Society of the United States writes: “It
is the best thing of its kind which has
yet come to our notice. We will suggest
to children who write us that they get in
touch with headquarters in Fredericton
and form a Kindness Club.”

A Racoon Captain from Port Credit,
Ontario, says: “Our Kindness Club has
twelve charming and enthusiastic mem-
bers. I hope to have a second club started
before Christmas. This is the kind of work
I can put my whole heart into.”

A young member from West Sunbury,
Pennsylvania, comments: “I. enjoy being
a member of this wonderful Club. When
I grow up, don’t be surprised when some
day you hear that an Animal Shelter has
been built in the hills of West Sunbury
County by me—Linda Chaff!”

A business man from Los Gatos, Cali-
fornia, writes: “The simplicity and good-
ness of the Kindness Club idea make me
believe that something like it can get
going everywhere very soon. Send me the

supplies and I am willing to devote a
good deal of time to establishing it here.”

Dr. Harry Lillie, that great humani-
tarian and second Dr. Schweitzer, says
in a letter: “I certainly have not seen
anything to compare with the Kindness
Club and friends here in Britain are most
interested.”

Sister Veronice, O.S.F., well—known
educator of Washington, DC, who
teaches science to science teachers, refers
to the Kindness Club in a recent article
as follows: “One practical method that
Fredericton has instituted is the Kindness
Club, whose object is to inculcate the love
and knowledge of birds and animals into
the minds of children and to provide
funds for recreational and educational
activities along those lines, and for the
provision of animal shelters, bird boxes,
veterinarian services and other humane
work. The children raise funds by selling
packets of Kindness cards. Each branch
Club is named for a different animal or
bird, such as the Beaver, Eagle, Chip-
munk, Owl, etc. This type of activity is
one which appeals to the young pre-teens
and its object is worthy of consideration.”

To ensure that Kindness Club meetings
are educational as well as fun, a guide
book for leaders is now in the hands of
the publishers, Brunswick Press of Fred-
ericton. Each programme consists of a
true and original story told to entertain
and at the same time to point out that
animals are indeed worthy of our respect
and protection, followed by hints from
the various humane societies on how to
be kind, then a bit of nature poetry to
be memorized, next a quiz on what has
been learned, and ﬁnally, exercises for
physical ﬁtness, and a game set to music.

It has been said that the degree of
civilization which a community or a
country has attained is best judged by
the degree of humaneness it exercises in
its treatment of animals. Those who know
the facts will readily agree that in this
regard most North American communities
lag far behind Britain and the Scandinav-
ian countries. The Kindness Club is one
vehicle for the improvement of our
standards.

Conservationists agree that we are
today engaged in a race between educa-
tion and the virtual extinction of many
valuable species of wildlife. Education
can win only when the majority of our
people are willing to join with Ruskin
in the following pledge: “I will not kill
or hurt any living creature needlessly,
nor destroy any beautiful thing, but will
strive to save and comfort all gentle life,
and guard all natural beauty upon the
earth.”

If it were not for the regrettable
example set by a great many adults, most
children would gladly set their feet on
the gentle path of conservation and com-
passion to follow the Call of Kindness
all the days of their lives.

FILMS AND FILMSTRIPS

The HSUS is frequently asked for sources of films and filmstrips that will
be useful in a humane educational program. The following films and filmstrips
are recommended by The HSUS.

DOGS, CATS AND YOUR COMMUNITY presents facts about the nationwide cruelty
caused by the uncontrolled breeding of puppies and kittens. It establishes
that millions of dogs and cats are homeless and unwanted now and that the over-
supply is constantly increasing because owners of unspayed female dogs and cats
continue to breed puppies and kittens they neither want not intend to keep.

The filmstrip makes a strong plea for spaying, for improved laws, and for
community level campaigns for the prevention of surplus animal breeding. It
is particularly recommended for civic organizations, women's clubs, church
groups and other associations concerned about community problems.

DOGS, CATS AND YOUR COMMUNITY consists of 57 color frames in filmstrip
form with a 12 minute recorded narration. It can be borrowed from The Humane
Society of the United States, 1111 E Street, N.W., Washington 4, D.C., for
scheduled showings for a charge of $1 for postage and handling. The filmstrip
and record may be purchased for $5.

PEOPLE AND PETS provides information about the care of dogs and cats,
anti-cruelty laws, ordinances for the control of animals and the purposes and
programs of humane societies and public pounds. Designed for all children
between 7 and 14 years old, it includes facts about animal care and protection
required by Girl Scouts working on their Cat and Dog Proficiency Badges.

PEOPLE AND PETS consists of 54 color frames in filmstrip form with a
21-minute recorded narration. It can be borrowed from The Humane Society of
the United States, 1111 E Street, N.W., Washington 4, D.C., at a cost of $1
for postage and handling. The filmstrip and record may be purchased for $6.

GINGER AND HER WOODLAND ORPHANS tells the story of a cocker spaniel who
befriends a beat, porcupines, raccoons and other woodland creatures and invites
her new playmates to visit her home. A 40-minute sound motion picture in color,
it is delightfully entertaining and, in showing the habits and friendliness
of wildlife, is enlightening for adults and children.

GINGER AND HER WOODLAND ORPHANS may be obtained from Mr. Carl 0. Marty, Jr.,
The Northernaire, Three Lakes, Wisconsin.

 




TRAPLINES shows the cruelty of the methods by which furbearing animals
are trapped so that furs may be available to women. Beautiful scenes of the
woodlands of North America contrast sharply with the views of the suffering
caused furbearers by the use of the steel-jaw, leg-hold trap which constitutes
one of the worst nationwide cruelties to animals. Recommended for adult audi-

ences. The board of directors of every humane organization should in particular
see the film.

TRAPLINES is a 16-mm sound motion picture color film. Running time: 30
minutes. It can be rented from Defenders of Furbearers, 3310 Dent Place, N.W.,
Washington, D.C., for a charge of $5, plus postage and insurance.

LET'S VISIT SOME ANIMALS OF THE WOODS is a 2-part filmstrip of 34 and 35
frames. Original art work in full color brings out authentic details of the
appearance and natural habitat of the animals. Titles are provided on each
of the frames. The 2-part series was planned for children of grades 1-8.

LET'S VISIT SOME ANIMALS OF THE WOODS, Parts I and 11, may be purchased
from Encyclopaedia Brittanica Films, Inc., Wilmette, Illinois.

MY LITTLE PUPPY, DILLY is a 29 frame filmstrip in color in which a puppy
tells, through titles on each frame, about his happy life. The filmstrip
encourages understanding and responsibility by children toward pets.

CHICO, MY PARAKEET PLAYMATE is a 30 frame filmstrip in color which pro-
vides information for children on the care of parakeets.

MY KITTEN, STAR is a 31 frame filmstrip in color that presents information
about the proper care of kittens and cats.

The three filmstrips described above were planned for children of grades 1~4
and may be purchased from Creative Arts Studio, Inc., 814 H Street, N.W.,
Washington 1, D.C., for $6 each.

Note: Creative Arts Studio gives a 10% discount on filmstrip purchases totalling
$15 or more.

CITY PETS: FUN AND RESPONSIBILITY is an 11 minute sound motion picture,
available in color or black and white, which superbly emphasizes the responsi-
bility children, as well as adults, must assume when they own animals. It
covers the basic facts about the care of dogs and serves to make children aware
of the dependence of animals on people for care and protection.

Planned for children of the primary grades, it can be purchased from Coronet
Films, Coronet Bldg., Chicago 1, Illinois, for $60 in black and white or $110
in color.

HOW THE ANIMALS DISCOVERED CHRISTMAS is a 13% minute sound motion picture,
available in black and white or color. Woodland creatures are portrayed semi-
realistically in animation. It uses the elements of animal fables in a story
infused with the delight and wonder of Christmas Eve-~that one night of the year
when, according to fable, animals can talk. The animals all'make use of their
special traits to help one of their fellow creatures in this exceptionally
beautiful and skillfully written and produced film. .

It is recommended for children and adults and can be purchased from Coronet
Films, Coronet Bldg., Chicago 1, Illinois, for $75 in black and white or $137.50
'in color. (The HSUS recommends that the color film be shown.)

FRISKY, THE CALF is an 11 minute sound motion picture available in black
and white or color. This story of a calf and the little girl who loves it and
watches it grow will be particularly interesting and educational for city children
who have little opportunity to get to know "country" animals. In all children
it will encourage affection for the little calf.

Planned for children of the primary grades, it can be purchased from Coronet Films,
Coronet Bldg., Chicago 1, Illinois, for $60 in black and white or $110 in color.

HOW ANIMALS LIVE IN WINTER is an 11 minute sound motion picture available
in black and white or color. This film provides children with fascinating facts
about the ways in which nature has enabled wildlife to withstand the harshness
of winter by hibernating, migrating, growing heavier coats, etc. It serves to
make children aware of the struggle of all creatures to protect themselves and
to live and the film consequently inSpires respect and protective feelings in
children for animals.

It is recommended for children of grades 1- 6 and can be purchased from Coronet
Films, Coronet Bldg., Chicago 1, Illinois, for $60 in black and white-or $110
in color.

SPOTTY: STORY OF A FAWN is an 11 minute sound motion picture available-in
black and white or color. This film is the story of the adventures of a young
fawn in its natural environment and for that reason took months of patient work
to produce. Children accustomed to seeing wildlife only in the unnatural
confines of zoos will be delighted by the beautiful presentation of the story
of a fawn. Such films about wildlife serve subtly to counteract pressures on
children to approve of hunting.

It is recommended for pre- ~school through grade 4 children and can be purchased
from Coronet Films, Coronet Bldg., Chicago 1, Illinois, for $60 in black and
white or $110 in color.

Note: Many other Coronet films, in addition to those previewed by The H808 and
described here, also serve an humane educational purpose. A catalog listing
all of the Coronet films may be obtained from Coronet. Coronet films may also
be rented. Check the listing of "Motion Picture Film Libraries" or "Motion
Picture Film Distributors" in your classified telephone directory for a Coronet
agency in your area or write to Coronet Films for rental information.

A catalog of Encyc10paedia Britannica filmstrips, which include such outstanding
Walt Disney productions as "Bambi," can be obtained from Encyclopaedia Britannica
Films, 1150 Wilmette Avenue, Wilmette, Illinois.
