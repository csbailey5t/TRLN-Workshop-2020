To PEACEMAKERS

The OUTLAWRY OF ,WAR betWeen nation and nation
is an urgent necessity if civilization is to continue.

 

But there can be no true peace on earth unless man
i also is prepared to OUTLAW WAR AGAINST THE ANIMAL
KINGDOM. -

'Do yOu realise that this war is going on continually,
ceaselessly, day in and day out P

Here are some of the chief campaigns now being
vigorously prosecuted against the animals by their overlord
——-Man :

Vivisectional ReSearch, under the banner of Science.

The Fur Trade ' ,, ,, Fashion.

Hunting and Shooting ,, ,, Sport.

Capturing and Cagingb
and training for
Circuses ' _

‘_ Slaughtering for Food ‘ Human

’ ‘ Necessity.

Amuse—
ment.

In some of these campaigns Man is gaining ground so
rapidly that WHOLE SPECIES OF WILD ANIMALS AND BIRDS
HAVE .BEEN EXTERMINATED and the continuance of others 13
endangered. '

EXPLOITATION—AGGRESSION—DOMINATION '
V IOLENCE—RUTHLESSNESS.

These are theweapons that at present Man is using in
his subjugation of the animal kingdom.

Is it not time that they were replaced by

PROTECTION—COMPASSION—IUSTICEL—
' HELPFULNESS—UNDERSTANDING P

Is it not time that the WAR OF MAN AGAINST ANIMALS
WAS RENOUNOED AND OUTLAWED P
