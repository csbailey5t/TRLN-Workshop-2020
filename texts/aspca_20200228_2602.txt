HONG KONG

Mr H. Maitland, Secretary of Hong Kong
SPCA, points out that 'all pigs slaughtered at
government abattoirs and the two private
slaughtervhouses in the New Territories are
electrically stunned ﬁrst.

The stunning equipment for the New Terri~
tories slaughter—houses only arrived from the
UK early in 1957, but those at the Government
abattoirs have been in use for some years.

CEYLON

The Ceylon Animal Lovers’ Association is
organizing a World Animal Art Exhibition to be
held at the Colombo Art Gallery in January
1958. The purpose of the exhibition is to stimu—
late interest in the Association.

 

BULLFIGHT BAN

From The Ark (August 1957), bulletin of
the Catholic Study Circle for Animal
Welfare: ,

Living in a country where a bullrﬁght is as
traditional a recreation as a football match
over here, Spanish priests have been seen at
bullaﬁghts in recent years. A new regulation,
banning cinemas, includes bull—ﬁghts among
the recreations forbidden to priests in
Spain. The Spaniards themselves now admit
that only British and American tourists are
keeping the bull'ﬁght from extinction.

CATTLE TRAFFIC

On Thursday, August 22, more Recommenda—
tions made by the Committee of Enquiry into
the Export of Live Cattle to the Continent
were implemented when the Exported Cattle
Protection (Amendment) Order, 1957, came into
effect. RSPCA Inspectors have been alerted to
ensure that the provisions of this amending Order
are observed. These include the provision that
protection be ensured against weather in all
premises where cattle are rested, that adequate
food and water are easily accessible, that not
more than forty cattle are detained in any one
compartment and that separate pens are provided
for ailing cattle.

Whilst seeking to ensure that everything is
done for the welfare of the animals, the
RSPCA still believes that the trafﬁc in live
cattle to the Continent for slaughter should
be discontinued and has made clear to the
Government its wish to see the immediate
adoption of the Recommendation calling for
a ‘ﬁlter price’ to be considered. Were a value
to be ﬁxed below which cattle could not be
exported, it would at once eliminate from the
trade animals least ﬁtted to stand up to the
journey.

Cattle are still going to Holland and Germany.
Other countries have not yet adopted the condi—
tions laid down by the British Government.

 

LOOKING AFTER THE COPPERS!

The pounds certainly looked after them—
selves for the Halifax Branch when the son
of the Honorary Secretary ‘took care of the
coppers’. Mr C. S. Horner, the Branch
Honorary Secretary, says that his younger
son, in the Rhodesian Police, entered a
competition in which he had to say in a
few words why he would like to win a large
sum of money. His reply was: ‘Because I
am a poor copper on the Copperbelt’. He
won the ﬁrst prize, and as well as receiving
the lump sum, was asked to nominate a
charity to beneﬁt. He naturally thought of
the RSPCA and Mr Horner has now re
ceived, from the organizers of the coma
petition, a cheque for £100 for Branch funds.

Congratulations to Mr Horner junior
and to the Branch! '

Abundance as a Crime

 

D. St LegervGordon traces in this article
the development of an erroneous myth, which
was used as an excuse for persecuting the
buzzard.

The author has written at greater length in
The Quarterly Review for April 1957 under
the title ‘The Passing of the Rabbit and After’.

The ensuing quotation is reprinted by
courtesy of Mr D. St Leger—Gordon and of the
Editor of The Quarterly Review.

 

 

 

In a previous article I expressed misgivings that
the mere abundance of the buzzard would bring
it into disfavour, but certainly nobody antici’
pated the extraordinary virulence of the campaign
that was launched against it. Logically, a beautiful
animal, like a ﬂower that is reasonably plentiful,
should be more highly appreciated than another
that is extremely rare. Its value to the country in
general is so much greater, the pleasure and in—
terest that its presence imparts being shared by
so many more people. A fine bird that lends Chara
acter to the landscape and may be seen by any,
one who possesses an aesthetic sense is surely
more important and worthier of preservation
than some passing ‘rarity’ which will probably
never be seen again, or some jealously guarded
inhabitant of a reserve to which only a few privi»
leged observers have access. Unfortunately the
reverse appears to be the case. Greater store was
set upon the lost sheep or piece of silver than all
which remained, and such is the prevailing atti—
tude towards wild life. The country boy’s remark
that there were ‘too many primroses’ was typical
of a mentality by no means uncommon, while
many shooting men regard any bird or beast
other than those preserved for the gun as possi—
bly inimical to sport or at least as something that
might as well be killed. A bird of prey, however
innocuous, is always suspect, and when the whis—
per ‘too many buzzards’ ﬁrst arose, the seed fell
upon fruitful soil.

The idea gained ground with miraculous
rapidity and for no apparent reason. The
buzzard had done nothing abnormal, yet
the bird acquired a bad Press overnight, as
it were. The slogan ‘too many’ became a
convention, or fashionable phrase, re—
peated by people not concerned in any way
and quite ignorant of the truth. The idea
had caught on, and once afoot it took the
customary course of most erroneous no—
tions. The obvious argument that an emi—
nently beautiful creature which harms

nothing cannot be too abundant had as
much effect as logical contention. usually
achieves in such circumstances.

The phase would probably have petered out
had not the myxomatosis epidemic among rabv
bits provided the anti’buzzard agitators with a
new line of attack. Even as the grey squirrel
was re—named the ‘treearat’ for propaganda pur’
poses, so the buzzard was dubbed the ‘rabbit
hawk’. Since rabbits had been practically exter»
minated, so ran the argument, buzzards would be
obliged to seek other game and might attack
anything.

The new campaign, like most of its kind, was
cleverly conducted. To counter any sympathy for
the grey squirrel, the alien was represented as a
destroyer of the popular native species, and upon
the same principle, to forestall protests from
ornithologists, the theory was circulated that
buzzards, deprived of their alleged customary fare,
would prey upon ‘other birds’. What ‘other
birds’ they were capable of destroying did not
transpire, while nobody seemed to realize that
myxomatosis affected the buzzard’s way of life
very little. As a general rule it merely preys upon
a few young rabbits during summer. The golden
eagle is the only British bird that habitually kills
any mammal larger than a rat. The false trail had
been laid, however, and served its purpose only
too well.

Soon the buzzard was carrying off ducks and
fowls of twice its own weight; attacking babies
and boys, menacing women and lorryrdrivers,
killing dogs and sheep; not to mention many
other feats quite beyond its capacity. Indeed, it
was putting any fabled exploits of lammergeiers
to shame. One achievement was reprinted in the
Field magazine, under the ‘Without Comment’
headline. Undeterred, the disciples of Iago prov
ceeded from strength to strength, and a competiv
tion for the best buzzard story could scarcely
have produced a richer crop. Eventually, imagina—
tion, exaggeration, and sheer mendacity com,
bined to manufacture a bird of prey unrivalled
in the world’s avifauna. The ‘eldritch erne’ of
Eskdale scarcely acquired so formidable a repur
tation. '

Indeed, never within personal experience has
any wild creature been so unjustly villified. Fox,
carrion—crOw, magpie, blackbacked—gull, and even
the grey squirrel were forgotten. The new public
enemy was represented as the evil genius of
Nature’s stage, destroyer of all living things from
pet Pekinese dogs to woodpigeons. Not long ago
on the popular radio programme ‘Any QUCSv
tions?’ one broadcaster ascribed the scarcity of

«skylarks to the inevitable source, ‘buzzards’.

They were also blamed last autumn for the gen—
eral dearth of young birds, a circumstance really

WILD ANIMALS ON THE LINE

(These brief extracts are reprinted, with acknow
ledgments, from a long and interesting article in
the ‘Times’) ,

In East Africa gazelles and zebra often race trains,
apparently just for fun, then cross the line in
front of the engine when safely ahead. Their
judgment is good, and only once in many years
have I found a zebra killed by a train, and never
a gazelle. The ostrich often tries to do the same,
but as it never seems to be able to make up its
mind for long which direction to run, it ﬁnishes,

after several false starts, by running away
altogether.

Exhibitionist Bull

One game warden tells a story of how he was
watching a small herd of elephant near the line
when a train passed. The beasts kept absolutely
quiet until the train had gone safely by, then the
bull came out of the bush, and put on a show for
the beneﬁt of the cows. He appeared to be telling
the train exactly what he would do to it, if it
came back.

Rhinos sometimes charge trains. But by the
time they have made up their minds, whether
really to charge or not, the train is safely past.
And as they have no idea of deﬂection angles, the
charge ﬁnishes up as a chase, which is soon
given up.

Pride of Lions

Engineers and inspectors, travelling about on
light trolleys, are more vulnerable, and they have
more excitement than engine drivers. I have fre—
quently passed rhino, although luckily always at
a safe distance, and once I passed within about
one hundred yards of a pride of nine lions, which
were resting in the shade of a thorn tree, but they
took no notice at all of me.

Another time, coming quickly round a curve,
I ran into a herd of baboons. They all made off
except for one young one, which remained on the
lines. The mother dashed back and snatched her
baby away from right under the trolly wheels.

Apart from the larger animals, one meets
many of the smaller ones on the railway. Tor—
toises walk for miles between the rails; they get
there at one level crossing, and cannot get out
until they come to another, often a long way
away.

BOOK REVIEW

The Status of Animals in the Christian Religion
by C. W. Hume, with marginal sketches by
Fougasse. UFAW. 83. 6d.

Animal welfare owes a great debt of gratitude to
Major Hume, and UFAW has been most fortunate
in enlisting the services of Fougasse. These debts
are added to by the production of this book.

Let us, however, put forward our criticisms.
From a strictly objective point of view, there is a
good deal of special pleading. It seems a pity that,
in seeking the aid of Christianity in animal wel—
fare, the great contributions of thinkers other
than Christian are, in some instances, not ac—
knowledged and, in some instances (such as the
Neoplatonists) actually disparaged. In the sixth
century BC lived Pythagoras. Of him it is recorded
that he taught that all animals are children of God
and that he bought ﬁsh alive in order to release
them. Even though these testimonies are late, they
were still far in advance of anything in Christi—
anity. In the third century BC Buddhism in India
was notable for humanitarian ethics greatly ahead
of the Vedic sacriﬁcial system which it superv
seded. There is good reason for the belief that
King Asoka established not only hospitals for
human beings but also dispensaries for sick ani—
mals. In Judaism the Essenes were strict vegea
tarians. In the second century AD Plutarch advo’
cated, very strongly, humanity to animals in a
way to which no parallel can be found in Christ—
ian writings for at least seventeen hundred years.
In the third century AD Porphyry wrote, ‘From
mere wantonness and licentiousness people
cruelly murder—in sport, in the huntingﬁeld, in
our circuses—vast numbers of innocent victims’,
and pointed out the deleterious effect of this on
the human beings involved. It would have been a
demonstration of Christian charity if Major
Hume had acknowledged such things.

On the good side, the author is alive to the
spiritual, as against the Scriptural and doctrinal,
issue in Christianity: ‘One may be verbally
orthodox but spiritually heretical’. His general
argument is that Christian charity must include
animals. Major Hume’s erudition tends to
be an obstacle to the book having a wide inﬂuv
ence, but, on the other hand, he brings to light
such facts as that Charles Darwin was one of the
most energetic promoters of the Cruelty to
Animals Act, 1876, which regulates experiments
on animals.

At a lower corner of every page is a drawing by
Fougasse of an animal mentioned in the Bible.
These ought to be made, in enlarged form, into a
separate picture—book: it would have large sales.

HUMANE CBNTROL

Myxomatosis, the disease of rabbits, is often
called ‘bighead’. Affected rabbits swell up in the
region of the face, ears, lops and nostrils. The
rabbit becomes, in effect, blind.

These authenticated statements are typical of
facts placed before the public by the RSPCA
when the Pests Act, which became law in 1954,
was being discussed.

Myxomatosis had reached this country from
an unknown source—though most likely from
France, where it had been introduced artificially.

Athough rabbits died a lingering death (11 to 18
days of suffering), some people argued that the
artiﬁcial spread of the disease should nevertheless
be permitted. Reduction of rabbit numbers, in
their opinion, justiﬁed suffering. Such a principle
was odious to the RSPCA and its belief that an
informed public opinion would uphold the view
was shown to be wellafounded: a clause introduced
into the Pests Act made it an offence to spread
myxomatosis deliberately.

This is still the law of the land, but a Bill

introduced recently into the House of Lords
seeks to alter it. At once the RSPCA raised its
voice in protest.

Why should the advocates of such a Bill find it
necessary? They told us in 1953 that myxoma—
tosis would rid us of rabbits and now, after four
years, rabbit numbers are increasing—just as the
RSPCA forecast.

As rabbits are surviving the present disease, the
advocates of artificially—spread myxomatosis
would need to introduce a more potent virus
even if the law were altered. . . . And when that
strain of the disease lost its effect, a virus stronger
still would be needed. Who will forecast where
such experiments would lead? Who can foresee
the possible harm to which it might give rise?

The RSPCA has never denied that rabbit num’
bers must be controlled. But it is equally adaa
mant in its assertion that control methods must
be the speediest and most humane possible. It
will fight to uphold this principle against every
attack. EDITOR

 

POLICE HERO RESCUES STRANDED LAMB

A lamb, who had fallen 200 feet over the cliffs at
Castell Coch, Mathry, Pembs., was spotted in a
cave that had been partly washed away by the
sea. A Coastguard volunteered to be lowered.
The first 190 ft. from the top was a very steep
slope and the rest of the distance of about 25 ft.
was a sheer drop into the water. Before reaching
the water level the Coastguard asked to be hauled
back. The water below him was about 6 ft. deep
and very choppy and he explained the heavy swell
made rescue difficult as there was a danger of
being swept on to the rocks. S/I Turnell voluna
teered in spite of this report to be lowered, but
Police Inspector Jones, who had already shown
himself intrepid in the rescue of animals (holding
the RSPCA Silver Medal and Bar), insisted on
going down. Lowered, he waded into the cave
and rescued the lamb, which was hauled up on a
separate rope uninjured, to be followed by the
gallant rescuer.

The Police Inspector has received a second Bar
to his RSPCA Silver Medal. '

DOG AND BIRD RESCUER

Inspector Burr performed three rescues in one
day, to earn for himself the RSPCA Bronze Medal.

It was Whit Sunday when he noticed a huge
crowd looking up the cliff face at North Marine
Drive, Scarborough, where a dog was stranded
on a ledge 60 feet up. The Inspector (who has a
long standing injury to his leg) started to climb
the face of the cliff. Despite great difﬁculty he
succeeded in reaching the dog, tucked it under
his right arm, and then made the difficult descent.
Near the ground the dog jumped from his arm
and ran off uninjured. '

Another rescue by the Inspector involved a
young gannet contaminated with oil. The help
less bird was being beaten against the seawall,
at North Marine Drive, Scarborough, by the

THEANIMAL WORLD 1'15

 

The ensuing article, reprinted from The Observer,
with acknowledgments, is an eloquent comment
on the keeping of wild animals in captivity.

PRIVATE ZOO

The Delinquents
of Dingley Dell

I took a bus from the Granada in Maidstone out
into the green, cool, singing country and got out
in front of a long drive. Maidstone Zoo said a
notice board.

One didn’t have any sort of zoo feeling, but I‘
arrived at a ﬁeld with llamas in it. One of them
came up to the fence and adopted a slightly
aggressive attitude, it was aiming and loading.
Before it could ﬁre I passed on, following another
path where I came across an enclosure with a
bison in it. THIS ANIMAL IS DANGEROUS cried a
placard. This warning was superﬂuous. The aniv
mal, though aged, was obviously steeped in
malevolence and its eye glittered with a long
dream of destruction.

_I passed on, and reached a grassy area some:
thing like a ruined village green, surrounded by
cages and menagerie boxes. In the centre was a
cage with a toy windmill on top of it, and in the
cage was a cockatoo, screaming its head off. I wana
dered around the boxes and met lions and tigers.
The ﬁrst lion sprang at me, thudding against the
iron bars, snarling hatred. Its snarl suddenly
stopped, and it seemed to be ﬁghting for breath.
Then it coughed, and there was something
piteous in its eyes.

Social Failures

The owner of the zoo appeared, Sir Garrard
TyrwhittaDrake. Maidstone Zoo is the only pri~
vate zoo in England (it opened in 1934), and Sir
Garrard confesses that he runs it at a loss. ‘But
it’s my hobby’, he said. ‘I can’t do without ani—
mals. Come along and I’ll show you round.’
Overgrown paths led to derelict cages in the grip
of nettle and cow parsley. All the animals and
birds were in excellent condition but most were
evidently neurotic. A sloth bear spat accurately
at me from twelve yards. (‘Tricky animals’, said

Sir Garrard.) An eagle owl with beautiful amber ,

eyes inﬂated its breast and gnashed its beak. Polar
bears sneered with Arctic malice. Monkeys (in a
roomy converted chicken house) chattered tiny
treacherous teeth and even the parrots muttered
under their breath.

‘Most of the animals are social failures’, said
Sir Garrard. ‘Pets who got out of control. Mon—

keys who bit children. Parrots with phobias.
Lions who mauled‘ their trainers. And so on.
Look, for instance, at this chimp.’ We stopped
in front of a huge, brooding chimpanzee with a
slow, angry problem in its eyes. A defeated SS
commandant, a boozing all—in wrestler, a convict
on the run. ‘That’s an old lady, actually’, said
Sir Garrard. ‘Her name’s Martha. After they’re
ﬁve years old, they’re intractable.’ Years ago, I
thought, this terrible old girl was dressed in a
tartan blouse riding a tiny bicycle, banging a
drum, playing a fake accordion. We visited a
two—humped camel (‘Look out’, cried Sir Gar—
rard, ‘it’s going to spit!’) and a species of antelope
with liquid black eyes (‘Look out for your hand’,
cried Sir Garrard).

The llamas are not as ﬁerce as they look, and
breed well in this country. It is quite likely that
they may become fashionable with their super—
cilious gait, towered neck and probing, basilisk
eye. Since it is not possible to import a llama
without its staying for a year in quarantine, the
price can go as high as one hundred and ﬁfty
pounds

Five for Threepence

Then there is a North African donkey. ‘Came
over in a boat from Morocco with an old lady’,
said Sir Garrard. ‘She saw it being overloaded by
an Arab, bought it and left it with me.’ I walked
over to this lowslung, long—eared creature, and it
padded swiftly away into the undergrowth, deep
in its maze of old dusty injustice and English rain.
‘Come and see the dogatrack’, said Sir Garrard.
We walked to a small grassy arena, a rustic, tiny
White City where a few coloured rags were
whisked around at the end of a cable. ‘We call
it the Terriers’ race. They’re let out of the traps
like a real dog track. Comedy stuff. They’re all
lost dogs, you know. Five races for threepence.
Dogs enjoy it, makes the kids laugh.’

Sir Garrard took me over to the house. ‘This
house was Dingley Dell of the Pickwick Papers’,
he said. ‘Wardle was really Spong who used to

Sir Garrard is Chairman of the Zoological
Gardens and Whipsnade Committee. He was
actually instrumental in starting Edinburgh Zoo,
has toured circuses and run a small zoo at Marv
gate. He has trained lions and ridden in procesv
sions for charity, and was knighted at the age of
thirty’ﬁve for services to his country. ‘Do you
hire out your animals, Sir Garrard?’ I asked.
‘Certainly’, he said, ‘to ﬁlm companies.’

Time was up, and Sir Garrard escorted me to
the front door of Dingley Dell. Near at hand, a
lion roared, then choked in a paroxysm of
coughing.

October 1957

due to a bad hatching season, from the effects
of which the buzzard itself suffered as much as
any species. This also applied, incidentally, to the
buzzards of Lundy, where rabbits were still plen—
tiful.

Among farmers and poultry keepers, any loss,
real or imaginary, was attributed to the same
cause, rather than to the customary and real pre—
dators. At the first glimpse of a big hawk circling
high in the blue, as its kind had done harmlessly
for half a century, consternation ensued. The
farmer reached for his gun and his wife seized the
nearest implement that might serve as a bird—
scarer. Clamour arose for the extermination of
this terror from the skies. The Home Secretary
was petitioned to remove so pernicious a bird
from the protected list. Here, however, the move—
ment encountered its first check. The Home
Secretary most laudably declined to do anything
so unjustified, and although legal ‘protection’ in
effect means little, its retention at least saved the
bird from ofﬁcially organized destruction.

Protected or otherwise, a large number of buz—
zards undoubtedly perished, and many people
who had preserved a sense of proportion feared
an extermination of the species. They were as
much surprised as relieved when the agitation
subsided like a pricked bubble. The main reason
for this seemed to lie in a verdict pronounced
by the agricultural correspondent of a West—
country paper. He described the buzzard as a
mainly inoffensive species which had been the
Victim of ‘unfair and exaggerated publicity’.
Thereafter no further stories appeared in print.
and controversy upon the subject suddenly
ended. Possibly the numerous Iagos had ex,
hausted their inventive capacity. Perhaps the buz’
zard had realized that, far from being a ferocious

THEANIMALWORLD 117

condor with homicidal tendencies, he was, after
all, nothing more than a peaceably disposed hawk,
content to feed upon moles, voles, and reptiles.
Whether the clouds will return after the rain
remains to be proved, but for the moment calm
prevails. ,

A buzzard is circling over my garden at this mo;
ment, his broad wings glinting silver in the sunlight,
as the hill—wind tilts his buoyant body. Watching
him there, one sees the only answer to the endless con!
flict between aesthetic and material. Surely those still,
winged sweeps and curves, that sublime and won—
drous soaring leave no doubt as to his value to the
scene. Were he the only buzzard in Devon, would not
ﬁfty ornithologists be watching him at this moment?
Surely the glory of his flight is no less wonderful be;
cause he happens to be one among many. Half a cen/
tury was required by the buzzard to reach his present
status. Should this be sacriﬁced to a few months of
hysteria and lawlessness?
