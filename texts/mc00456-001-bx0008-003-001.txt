The Meaning of Vivisection

Vivisection means literally the‘ ‘cutting up alive’ of animals. The object in
view is the gaining of knowledge, supposedly for the benefit of humanity. The
word is now used in a wider sense to include all experiments on animals—not only
cutting and mutilating Operations, but others ofa less obviously painful nature, such as
inoculations and “feeding” (more accurately “- starving”) experiments.

in these islands alone some 60,000 to 80,000 animals are thus done to death
every year.

Vivisection is Cruel

This must be “clearly understood. Those concerned often attempt to make out
that all cruelty has been done away with, that the animals are always anaesthetised,
thateverv care is taken etc. An Act was passed in 1876, 0stensibly to protect the
animals. but as p1actically every one of its p1ovisions is nullified by the issue of a

_’cert1f1cate exempting the use of anmsthetics or other specified protection, it is little

better than a dead-lettm A doctor who has been behind the scenes says “it is all
g t; ﬁorgformyfor v1v1sec'tvd animalslthey dont get it... it is the humane
‘teelmgs of the wonc that hat/e been anaeStnetlsed “

The experiments not involving cutting a1e of course pe1fo1med without any
anaesthetic at all. These are chiefly inoculations, in which not only is the virus
of every loathsome disease injected into animals’ bodies, but all s01ts of grit and filth
are rubbed into the eyes and on to open sores, and pois0ns and disease germs of

every known variety, some of which take days, weeks or months to breed the
disease to its full climax.

The chief remaining class is the so- -called feeding experiments, which consist
principally of witholding certain essential constituents from an animal’s diet, andthen
watching it slowly starve to a lingering death of hunger, emaciation and disease.
Repulsive and filthy matters are also sometimes administered as food, with a view to
produce diseases of the internal organs.

It is much to be regretted that space does not permit of concrete instances being
given of these experiments, but the evidence exists in abundance, and those who are
content to believe that all the accounts of cruelties inflicted are “greatly exaggerated,”
are recommended to read the instances published by the various Anti-Vivisection
societies, taken from the official scientific records themselves.

The Moral Question

Vivisection is cruel. N 0 one who enquires at all impartially can fail to realise that.

Cruelty is a crime. There is no doubt about that. in ordinary law, anyone
convicted of cruelty to an animal is a criminal, and liable to punishment.

How is it then that certain men are specially licensed to be cruel? Simply
because of the supposed benefits that are expected to accrue to humanity. It is

simply the old story of doing wrong that good may come. That is the simple
ultimate issue.

In a word————Vivisection is Cruel—Cruelty is a crime.

 




 

The Result of Vivisection

in all history, nothing is more clearly shown than the utter futility of this old
attempt to attain a good end by wrong means, to do wrong that good may come.
Always the result is the same—confusion and contradiction, and complete failure to
obtain the good end sought.

So it is with Vivisection---—confusion, contradiction and utter failure are the result.
Outwardly a loudly—trumpeted harvest of results, inwardly a ceaseless wrangle and
dispute. No scientists are more at variance than the vivisectors, each contradicting
the others with his own differing results. Fresh boastful claims and theories are set
up, only to be repeatedly overthrown bynew claims and contradictions.

Again it is to be regretted that lack of space prevents the givingof instances of
this incessant controversy. This one outstanding, undeniable fact can onlybe stated
and emphasised,-——that there is not one single claim to a beneficial result gained from
vivisection, that is not the subject of the fiercest dispute, not only from outSide but
often even among the vivisectors themselves. Those interested are recommended to
peruse some of the voluminous controversial literature already existing on this
subject.

It is a striking fact that of those diseases whose modern treatment is now found-
ed on vivisection, the death—rate is increasing ; whereas of those whose treatment 18
still on pure and common—sense lines, the death—rate is decreasing. As an instance,
diphtheria may be cited. A serum is used for this, extracted from animals; claimed to
be all but infallible. The death-rate from diphtheria is now higher than when the
serum was introduced!

Sometimes we are told to leave all this to the “experts.” But the experts do not
agree. Doctors are by no means unanimous as to the utility of vivisection. Whole
books could be Written, and have been written, compiled solely from the evidence of
doctors as to the cruelty and uselessness of vivisection.

The great harm 'that vivisection has done hath to science and humanity, has been
the debasing of the healing art, the highest“ and noblest of all arts and“ sciences. . By
basing it on a foundatiom of cruelty, it has been led to a quagmire of materialism.
Attention has been diverted from the vital importance of the essential conditions of
healtht—purity, cleanliness, right living—the neglect of which is the primary causeof
disease—and concentrated on a hunt for germs, which are at best only a secondary
cause. PeOple are misled to believe that they can regain health by having the blood—
serum of a diseased animal injected into their bodies, or by the transplantation of a
gland from a living animal, or by feeding on some gland extract—~such is the low state
of gross materialism to which medical science has sunk, and from which it may take
years to recover.

Here, as always, the only rule is——-—do right, and right results will follow; do
wrong, and nothing but wrong can result.

This state of affairs is indicated graphically on the attached diagrams, which need
no further introduction.

NOTE—This Diagram indicates that the spirit that underlies Vivisection is one with that which is reSponsible for all the Evil in the world. It is selfishness, the attitude of Cruel, Self-Seeking Gain, at
whatever cost to others.

. It explains how it is that merely Materialistic Research, so strikingly effective incall the PhY'SiCE11 Sciences,. fails so completely in Medical Science. For Man is not a mere Physical Machine—he is a
Spiritual Being, and the Body but his outmost vesture and expressmn. His source IS hidden, hls SDl‘lngs of life and action are from within, from higher planes, and to neglect this and attempt to heal
by mere tinkering with externals, and by means founded on Cruelty that is an outrage to his Moral and Spiritual Nature, can only lead to failure.
