PET THEFT
LAW PASSED

The Michigan State Legislature is
one of three that took action during
the past year to make theft of pets
more difficult, The Michigan law is
the most comprehensive of the three.

Dealers who sell dogs or cats for
laboratories must have revocable
licenses, must identify each animal,
and, with the research facilities,
make and keep records of
transportation and

must
purchase, sale,
handling of the dOgs and cats with
which they deal.

The director of the Michigan
Department of Agriculture is charged
with publishing these and other rules
and regulations governing the hand-
ling of dogs and cats by dealers and
research facilities. A dealer’s
license may be revoked or suspended
if he has been convicted of cruelty
to animals. _

New York law prohibits scientific
institutions from purchasing dogs and
cats for experimental purposes unless
they receive from the seller and
keep on record the proof of ownership,

Massachusetts raised the penalty
for theft of a dog to $1,000 or a
year’s imprisonment or both. Wrongo
ful removal of a dog’s collar may be
punished by a $100 fine, six months
imprisonment, or both. _

I am overwhelmed and very humbly honored to i " is wonderful award,
and, at this time, pledge myself to live up to the reverence-for animal life
for which this award stands.
The position, which I hold as State Veterinarian in Michigan, has historically
and traditionally, through the years, revolved round the control and eradication
of animal diseases, and by that I mean diseases of the common domestic farm animal.
Little attention was given to our animal pets, either From a disease standpoint
or from the standpoint of just and humane treatment. However, in latter years,
because of an increased interest in the humane treatment of animals, new laws have
»ed, both on the Federal and State level, regulating the.care and t*eatment
of all species.
Ex(mpl~< of some of these on a State level in Michigan is the Animal el.are
Act, which was passed in lgif; and patterned almost exclusively after Public Law
89.544; the niclicen himsuw Slaughter Law, which restricts the use of iniumane
devices in the routine slaughtering of meat animals, along with the Cruelty to
Animals Law, which restricts the maltreatme t of animals in public places as well
as on the Cl zl ers' premises, has helped us tremenduously in the treatment of animals

by livestock producers.

he also have a rather primitive sounding laii which prohibits the Feed ing M

dead animals to other animals. This law might sound a bit facetious but experience
has proven to us that it is not below some sadistic livestock owners to attempt to

dispose of animals in their care, which have died, by feeding them to the poor, half
starved carnivores left on the pr mises " r condition genera 013:09 oes along

with such an owner who, generally, does not have -2 ion in sheer hearts

Also, I am very gratified and thankful that after seventy-two
years of existense the staid, old Knited States Livestock Sanitary
Association which, I might add, jun: recently lost its name and

is now called the United States animal Health Association, too,

has become interested in animal weliare.

A new Committee has been formed wi' in this organization to deal

with the problems of animal welfare and is charged with the

responsibility of developing model legislation which can be used

as a guideline by either States or the Federal Government in

regulating the proper treatment of our animal friends.

This, to me is a wonderful step in the right direction for the
United States Animal Health Association has through the years
built up a world-wide reputation iur developing and promoting
animal health programs and its mentorship is made up of all

phases of the livestock industry.

 




/

I give great credit to the animal welfare societies for the work which

they have done to improve the lot of our animal friends. However, this is not
enough. Everyone in our great country, even remotely connected with animals,
must be encouraged to take part in a concentrated effort to see that all animals
receive decent treatment. We know that it does sound like an insurmountable goal
to work toward but I am sure, in my own mind, that it can be achieved and doubly
sure that it must be achieved.

Mankind could not have survived in this country without the help of his animal
friends, therefore, I think it would be a sn ll tribute to repay what they have
done for us with a little kindness on our part.

In conclusion, on behalf of the Michigan Department of Agriculture and myself,
I'w'sh to thank all of you who were responsible for bestowing this wonderful

on ma.

mer Bad Axe Man Wins

1968 Albert Schweitzer Award

Dr. John F. Quinn, former
Bad Axe man who is state vet-
erinarian and chief of the Ani-
mal Health division, Michigan
Department of Agriculture, has
been selected to receive the 1968
Albert Schweitzeraward.

DR. JOHN QUINN

The medal will be presented
December 10 in ceremonies at
Washington, D.C. Jack Howard,
president of the Scripps-Howard
Newspaper, will make the pres.
entation.

Officials of the sponsoring or.
ganization, the Animal Welfare
Institute of New York, said Dr.
Quinn was selected for his con-
tributions to animal welfare and
cited particularly his develop.
ment in 1967 of a new, perma-
nent Animal Welfare committee
as part of the United States An-
imal Health association (former-
ly the U.S. Livestock Sanitary
Association).

The Schweitzer medal, pre.
sented annually with a $500 cash
award for an “outstanding con-
tribution to animal welfare”, was
first awarded in 1954 to the fa.
mous humanitarian for whom it
is named.

Inscribed on the medallion,
along with a likeness of Schweit-
zer, is a quotation from him:
“We need a boundless ethic which
will include the animals also.”
Previous award winners include
such notables as Vice President
Hubert Humphrey and the late
Rachel Carson, author of the
controversial best - seller,
“Silent Spring.”

He is immediate past presio

expires in 1971. A native of the .
Thumb area of Michigan, he was

the state for the last 18 years. .

Nader Warns Of

japanese Cars

WASHINGTON (UPI) -— Auto
critic Ralph Nader Monday
urged immediate government
action to include minicars in
its safety regulations, or face
threat of cars with the
“collapse capability” of a Jap-
anese lantern.

According to Nader, Japanese
manufacturers plan to flood the
American market with mini-
cars weighing under '1,000
pounds.

The National Highway Safety
bureau originally exempted
cars under 1,000 pounds from
the government safety regula-
tions. But later is issued a no-
tice of proposed rule - making
which would apply to standards
to the minicars.

However, in a letter to Safety
Bureau chief Dr. William Had.
don, Nader claimed there was
no indication the government
would issue the final standards
in time to stop a flood of mini-
cars on the American market.

The leader of the minicar im.
port surge is Japan’s Fuji
Heavy Industries, maker of the
Subaru 360, Nader said. So far,
5,500 Subarus have been sold in
the United States, and the com-
pany expects to sell 3,000 a
month, he said.

Nader claimed Honda, Suzuke
and several other Japanese
companies would also export
large numbers of their mini-
cars.

“These minicars have the col-
lapse capability that is reminis-
cent of a Japanese lantern in
a crash,” Nader claimed.

Despite this, Nader said there
was no indication that the gov.
ernment planned to issue any
new safety standards before
spring._

 




This is the annual report by AHA executive di-
rector Rutherford T. Phillips which was present—
ed at the Association's 92nd National Con-
vention during late October in San Francisco.

The theme of this 92nd National Con—
vention of The American Humane As-
sociation is ”Leadership —- Today and
Tomorrow”. Today’s world is rapidly
changing and, as AHA celebrates its 92nd
birthday and the humane movement be—
gins its 103rd year, we feel itis important
to assess our position.

Today’s world is far different from
what it was when Henry Bergh founded
the first humane organization in this
country.

People in the cities at that time did not
know what was taking place on the farm,
and vice versa. People in this nation did
not know what was taking place in India,
Africa or Europe; at least, not for many
days, weeks or months after events oc-
curred.

In this country, in the late 1800’s,
we had vast natural resources, yet man’s
life was still hard, and people generally
did not show much concern if an ani-
mal’s life was as difficult as that of man.

There was a respect for authority --
whether in the hands of the state, or of
the family head. There was a strong
feeling of property rights, which included
man’s right to dominate or use his family
and his animals as he saw fit.

We in the humane movement —- and I
use this term to mean the founders, our
predecessors -- and those of us working
actively today ~— were and perhaps still
are the gadﬂies of the social conscience
of this country. Our efforts brought
about protection of children, protection

of animals, even the protection of public

health through laws or regulations cov-

ering animal health and food animals.

Our compatriots in industry, engineer-
ing and the other professions brought
about major improvements in our lives,
as well. Today we have a much different
situation than existed a century—plus ago.
In the firstplace, communication—-wheth-
er it be television, radio, newspaper or
transportation _- brings today’s events to
all of us, within seconds or minutes. In
some cases, where this crosses the inter-
national dateline, we know ”tomorrow’s”
happenings ”today.”

Jack Valenti, president of The Motion
Picture Association of America, points
out that this has had a tremendous im—

purpose, and many —-like ourselves--who
actually devote our time and effort toward
the best for all living things.

It behooves us now to assess our
position.

* We must clearly understand our goals.
* We must assess our accomplishments.
* We must plan our future efforts.

The program for this Convention was
set up to stimulate thinking along these
lines. In today’s age of technological
and professional knowledge among all
of the citizens, including our children
in grade school, we must know the most
efficient way to accomplish our purpose,
which -— in the broad sense —— is the edu—
cation of everyone to the fact that good
care is good business.

What is AHA’s place in this program
and what is your place? I think we need
to recall the fact that, in our democratic
society —— and with our system oflaws ——
AHA was established as a national feder—
ation of the child and animal protective
organizations of the country. Over these
92 years, the Board and Officers have
consistently tried to maintain this posi—
tion of AHA: as a communication cen-
ter; as a spokesman for the organiza-
tions operating in the humane field; out-
lining policies which are the consensus
of the most experienced people.

We must recognize that we are a group
of many personalities with many ideas
about the right way to secure acceptance
of our common objectives, whether it
be legislation or accepted practices.

The strength and growth of the hu—
mane movement over the years has been
our ability to face these many problems;
sometimes to disagree -- but then to reach
a solution which benefits the helpless.

We have secured legislation -— some-
times quickly -- (it seems too slowly in
some cases) -- we are still fighting. We
cannot immediately force the world into
a Utopia as evidenced by the fact that
cockfighting and dogfighting —- which
have been illegal for many years -- are
still going on.

Prevent Cruelty

Our purpose is THE PREVENTION
OF CRUELTY AND RELIEF OF SUF-
FERING, and we should direct our ef-
forts to doing the most good for the
greatest number. We must build our
special forces to be professionally com-
petent to enforce existing laws. We must

build our programs to educat -- whether
it be through public relations and pub-
licity, through the achievement of legis—
lation, or through educating the public -—
beginning with our children -— that the
humane way is the best way for everyone.

From the publicity standpoint, it is
much easier to sell an idea by showing
the ”black and the white” but, in the
long an approach through the
”gray” area, in between, may accomplish
more good for greater numbers more
quickly.

The American Humane Association’s
Board and Officers welcome all the as-
sistance it is possible to receive in solving
the problems facing us. If individuals
and organizations wish to be concerned
with these problems we welcome them.
We do not oppose efforts that may paral-
lel ours —- or differ from ours -—but gladly
join in a common effort to bring about
an improvement in the humane ideals

of the public.
Years Ago

We do become discouraged with scan-
dal newspapers, magazinesrand books
which exaggerate the facts, or report
conditions that existed years ago but
which have been or are now being reme-
died. We feel that publicity or publi—
cations which imply ignorance of facts
—- or deliberate approval of inhumanity -—
to the public, to those involved with the
use of animals, or to organizations in
our field, only hinder changes and im-
provements and make our predecessors
appear incompetent. The person who is
made to appear a blackguard will fight
back harder, even though he may have
sought to improve his ways in the past.

There are those who have urged unity
within the humane movement. I cer-
tainly believe completely in this philoso-
phy. On the other hand, just as we have
been the gadﬂy to the public and the
government, it is good for us to have
differences of opinion within the ”fam-
ily.” The danger comes when individuals
become too complacent on the one hand
or too dictatorial on the other. In spite
of these problems of individuals, we have
made progress. Let us appraise our
position to refresh our memories.

We are all aware that, in a century,
we have gone from no organizations to
more than 700. From little or no con-
cern to general public sympathy and
concern for the helpless. From concerns
about livestock transportation, slaughter-
houses, work horses and fighting ani-
mals to concerns for all living things,

run,

all over the world, under all circum—
stances. This, I believe, makes us ques-
tion some of the statements and publi-
cations which imply that there have been
no improvements, no lessening in suffer—
ing of exploited children and animals.

AHA is made up of individuals, be
they members, officers or workers, but
they have attempted to assist the helpless
directly -— through education and
through assistance to those dedicated
workers carrying on programs of direct
assistance.

looking of Progress

For a quick glance at the progress in
more recent years, I point out that twelve
years ago AHA was recovering from a
questioning of its program, which cost
it considerable in diversion of the efforts
of its workers and its budget. The sup—
port of all of you in the humane move—
ment and the public with a concern for
the welfare of the helpless has resulted
in major changes in twelve years.

For the fiscal year 195 6, the AHA bud-
get was $336,822; for the year ending
June 30, 1968, it was $585,279. Al—
though price levels change, this increase
of 74% would have been impossiblewith-
out the wonderful support of the hu—
mane—minded public.

In 195 6, our field department of five
made visits to over 400 agencies, and
participated in 8 meetings. In 1968,
with only two men in the field depart-
ment, but with assistance of other staff
and service council members, we de-
veloped 11 new societies or federations,
assisted 37 municipalities, and partici-
pated in 85 conferences and meetings.
In addition, direct supervision was pro—
vided over rodeos and horse shows, and
investigations were made in numerous
areas where there were no local society
personnel available.

Publicity, Mail

In 195 6, we had newspaper and maga-
zine articles reaching 250,000 people,
broadcasts were worth $10,000. We
were printing and distributing 546,724
leaﬂets, booklets, posters and other ma—
terials to assist the local organizations
in our joint program of welfare. In
1956, we handled 38,100 pieces of cor-
respondence, and mailed 102,900 pieces
in bulk. We shipped 546,724 material
aids.

In 1968, we had 5,000 articles pub-
lished with a potential readership of
400,000,000 -- twice the population of
the U.S. Radio and television broad—

casts had a commercial time value of

In 1956, our educational program
consisted of the NEWSLETTER, SHOP—

to 5,000 people. During these 12 years
distribution has increased more than
1000 per cent.

In 1968, more than 3,500,000 chil-

Our poster contest carried a message
of kindness to millions, culminating in
7,000 entries, plus those of local con-

over 7,000 teachers.

In 1956, we had no library. Today,
our library is building rapidly. We have
a regular exchange of publications and
information with hundreds of organiza-
tions with related interests, including 19
foreign-based groups, and we are car-
rying out an active exchange of copies
of technical and historical material with
general and professional libraries
throughout the country.

Children's Department

In 1956, our Children’s Department
distributed 4,000 copies of two publi—
cations and participated in twelve meet-
ings and workshops. Correspondence
and mailings totalled 43,000. In 1968,
we distributed, 100,000 copies of publi-
cations and produced three new books.

I call your attention to page 14 of
our National Humane Report for 1967
which lists some of the organizations
with whom we are corresponding, meet—

To the few who say there have been no
improvements in the welfare of the help—
less over the years, I would like to point
out that not only are these many or-
ganizations and agencies coming to us
for guidance and assistance iii-“meeting
problems which affect our charges, but
in recent years have bleen‘establishing
standards and regulations, and sponsor-
ing or enforcmg legislation which pro—
tectsr Our charges ‘often before their con—
dition ‘perm1ts us to step into the picture
under the anti—cruelty laws. TheSe activ-
ities eliminate stress and provide proper
care and housing.

For example, Dr. John Quinn, presi—
dent, United States Livestock Sanitary
Association, appointed an Animal Wel-

'- egate left early because of this.

 

In today's world of rapid communication -- and
competition -- we must have the best competence
in our lield. Certainly, we are not downgrading

"dedication" -- the purposes for which we are all
working -- but merely making sure that we are
making ours the best possible ellort.

We try to program our national conclaves and
regional meetings to meet the most pressing needs
ol the day. This year's program did not include
any sessions on shelter construction, and one del-
We assume that
most at you already have shelters; AHA has pub-
lications on the subject and, certainly, every del-
egate here has the opportunity to discuss special
problems and areas of concern with others in our
field from throughout the nation.

OI course, our goal is to do the best possible
job. Plans are going ahead right now for our

fare Committee and charged the com 93rd national conclave, which will be held in the

mittee ”to investigate the need for filling
gaps in existing Federal legislationwhich
does not ensure healthy and humanely
treated animals to be provided to the
public.” He noted the need for a uni-
form, model bill for consideration by
the states, covering pet shops, pounds
and animal shelters as well as dealers,
auctions and kennels. Weiwelcome such
aid from concerned agencies.

-"These activities do sometimes present
problems. Do we want government to

is the future of the child protection or-
ganizations and the animal protection
organizations- These are the challenges
to our leadership —- today and tomorrow --
wh1ch'must be answered.

Our“ people need professional know-

which is the best way to bring about
the most good for the greatest number

AN EDITORIAL CONCERNING SO-CALLED
“DOG BURNING" WAR PROTES'I'S

Plans to burn a dog with napalm
at Grossmont Junior College in Cali-
fornia — as a protest over the Viet~
nam war — drew international pub-
licity last month.

We immediately contacted our local
affiliate in the area, the San Diego
Humane Society, which was already
at work —— behind the scenes —— to as-
sure that sanity would prevail.

The entire situation was ably han~
dled by the Society —— discreetly and
quietly and without undue publicity
-— under the guidance of W. R. Vir-
den, executive director. On the day
scheduled for the publicity stunt, all
was quiet on the Grossmont campus.
The Humane Society had full coop—
eration from College officials; County
Sheriff’s Dept. and District Attorney’s
office; and the El Cajon Police Dept.

It was a macabre publicity stunt; it
had to be, or there would have been no
publicity. The promoters were effective
only in achieving their publicity goal;
their “message” was obliterated by pub-
lic indignation and disgust. We have no
desire to give further and undue pub-
licity to the desecration which some
American youth have heaped upon their
country. However, we are reporting this
incident to reassure our friends—many
of whom have written, wired or tele-
phoned; many who have not contacted
us, but who are upset and concerned.

As a matter of fact, the established
humane movement has been quietly and
efficiently handling many comparable
situations during recent months, even
though the previous demonstrations re-
ceived much less publicity.

There was a “protest” scheduled for

Veteran’s Day in Cincinnati. Norbert C.
Mahlman, manager of the Hamilton
County SPCA, kept close watch on this.
Some 500-600 people showed up for the
demonstration, with sentiment running
at least 3-2 against the demonstrators.
No dog appeared.

At Virginia Commonwealth Univer-
sity, a proposed dog burning turned out
to be another publicity stunt to attract
attention to an anti-war rally.

In San Francisco, students at the
State College there stole a rabbit and
threatened to burn it with napalm in
public. Humane officers returned the
bunny to its hutch, without incident.

A threatened dog burning at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania last April turned
out to be another hoax, yet humane 0f-
ficers were on the scene “just in case.”

German students at Munich Univer-
sity pulled a similar publicity stunt,
which created a brief international rip—
ple and even a “Save the Dog” fund
raising campaign by someone in Cali-
fornia. AHA contacted the International
Society for the Protection of Animals

which followed up. There was no in-

cident. .
Press releases concerning a dog burn-

ing in Spokane led to a blind alley.
Also listed as come-ons, but investigated
by the AHA-affiliated humane inspec-
tors, were protest burnings of a dog
at Grand Central Station; a pig at Stony
Brook University on Long Island; an-
other dog at C. W. Post College in New
York. (Humane officers did obtain five
convictions against persons who re-
leased pigeons at Grand Central Sta-
tion!)

Among the first in the current series

of publicity-stunt-anti-war-protest-sacri-

fices was threatened at the University of
Colorado in Boulder some 14 months
ago. Humane officers and the district
attorney stood by and no animal cruelty
took place.

Naturally, all humane-minded Ameri-
cans—which includes just about every-
one—are startled and upset when they
hear about these publicity stunts. Public
concern and reaction has been over-
whelming. Certainly, the protestors have
nothing to gain if they become a bar-
baric part of what they are protesting;
indeed, if anything, they are demon-
strating nothing more than their own
distorted views.

The American Humane Association
and its affiliates in your area have been,
and will continue to remain alert to
these threats and to take any action
necessary. That is why we are here,
as the established humane movement has
been—on an ever-increasing scale—for
more than a century. This is just one
small part of our regular service to the
public.

We do not spend time or money for

[mass distribution of special bulletins on

routine matters such as this, when
action by our members and friends is
not-necessary. (Inquiries are answered
promptly, however.) This report is in
cluded as a matter of general interest
due to the widespread (and undue) pub-
licity given to the Grossmont College

and Cinc'nnati situations.

To un erstand how this small part of
humane activity fits into the total hu-
mane picture, we invite your attention
to the annual report by our executive
director which is the feature of this
Christmas issue of the NATIONAL HU-
MANE NEWSLETTER.

DECEMBER 1968

ATTENTION
EVERYBODY!

With the 1968 elections now history,
it’s time to take steps toward increased,
organized political action. The MVMA
Legislative Committee under the leader—
ship of Dr. Ted Barr needs your help.
Before the committee can hope to achieve
any effectiveness in this important phase
of our professional and community life,
it needs answers to some practical ques-
tions that you can supply:

Do you know your state and federal
representatives personally?

If not, why not?

Who should take the first step in
getting acquainted?

If you do know your representatives
in Lansing and Washington, when was the
last time you talked with them personally?
When did you write them?

Do your representatives know the
views and aims of veterinary medicine?

How can MVMA work with them in
the interest of our profession and the
people we serve? ‘

For the answers needed immediately,
a postcard is enclosed with this News-
letter. Please return it at once.

If you do know your Legislators, take
a few minutes to invite them to attend
the MVMA reception, preferably with
you. All have been written a letter and
are being mailed a formal invitation by
MVMA but your personal call will be the
one that is important./

A PARISIAN HOLIDAY
AT BOYNE MOUNTAIN

Modestly proclaiming the 87th Annual
Meeting to be the “best of its kind in ’69”,
General Chairman Duane Kosht and his
chairmen have already completed a major
portion of the plans for the conference.

Like increasing the stay at Boyne
Mountain from two and a half days to
three and a half days and for a really big
shew, you can check in on Saturday, the
let and check out Thursday, the 26th).

Officially the convention will open on
Sunday with the entire day devoted to an
in depth seminar. The next two and a half
days will be devoted to classes in Farm
Animal and Pet Practices and Regulatory
Medicine sessions. Mini-conferences, pop-
ular last year, will again be featured.

And, of course, all the fun things of
past Annual Meetings are being scheduled
like two golf tournaments, an extra
“goings-on” on Sunday (like a visit to
Monaco?), etc. The convention theme is to
be a Parisian Holiday.

Need we say more? We will, you can be
assured, but for the time being mark the
dates in red on your new calendar, order

your Paris costumes and save your francs.

Applications for passports will be mailed
to you in the early spring.

t DR. QUINN HONORED

Jack Quinn, who does more things of
top level quality than it seems possible for
one man to handle, has been named the
recipient of the 1968 Albert Schweitzer
Medal of the American Welfare Institute.

The Award, presented to MVMA’s
Immediate Past President by Jack Howard,
President of the Scripps—Howard News—
papers and S-H Broadcasting Company,
was given in “recognition of his dedication
to practical advancement of animal wel-
fare in the enforcement of the Michigan
Dog Law, Humane Slaughter Law and
Laboratory Animal Welfare Act and his
wisdom in creating the ﬁrst standing
committee on Animal Welfare of the
United States Animal Health Association
when he served as the Association’s Presi-
dentin its 72nd year.”

With the MVMA
year about half over,
things seem to be
jelling in ﬁne shape.

Many of the com-
mittees have met and
in most cases Chair-
men have begun a
plan of action; others
are planning commit-
tee meetings in the
near future. From all appearances, our
year will be one of action.

I wish to thank all for their help and
enthusiasm. If any member has a thought,
suggestion or recommendation for the
betterment of MVMA and/or our profes-
sion, please contact your MVMA Director,
our Executive Secretary or yours truly
and we will get on with it.

Only 4 Months ’Till Tax-Time . . .

There’s always someone around to take
the joy out of life but we thought it wise
to remind our members that Federal
income taxes are due in less than four
months after you get this Newsletter.

By planning ahead and thinking about
the tax forms you will be filling out for
the .April 15 deadline, you may achieve
some substantial savings.

MVMA has made it possible for you to
subscribe to a tax service The Small
Business Tax Control at a reduced rate.
SBTC offers practical advice that could
help you reduce your tax cost. Details of
the service were sent to you with your
MVMA Directory recently.

It is recommended that your account-
ant or tax lawyer be consulted on all tax
matters in question.

Stanley J. Bower, 53, West Lafayette,
lnd., well-known to Michigan veterinar-
ians died unexpectedly in November. Dr.
Bower joined MVMA as an Associate
Member in 1959 and attended many of
its meetings. He was a key speaker on
the Large Animal Program for the 1968
Annual Meeting held in June. At the time
of his death, Dr. Bower was Chairman
of the Veterinary Extension Department
of Purdue University and Treasurer of the
Indiana VMA. Priortojoining the Purdue

1sv IAMFS BENSON

Jack R. Howard, president of
Se: ipp-s-HOward Newspapers

1 and S-cr-ipps-Howard Broadcast-

ing Company, presented the 1968

Albert Schweitzer Medal of the

Animal Welfare Institute to Dr.
J ohn F. Quinn last night.

Dr. Quinn, chief of the Animal
Health Division of the Michigan
State Department of Agricul-
ture, received the ‘aWard for
“his humane leadership and his
devotion to duty in enforcing
Michigan laws for the protection
of research animals as well as
those used for food,” the cita—
tion said.

“In these brutal times some
people may question the empha-

 

 

 

sis on animal welfare as against
human welfare. In my mind, the
two- go hand- in hand. I don"t
believe we will ever achieve our
goals in human welfare With-out
achieving our goals in animal
welfare.” Mr. Howard said. ,

“The creatures who are the
.5 nimal Welfare Institutes con-
cein can teach us much. By ex-
posing ourselves to them thru
p1 oiects and programs of the
kind to which the man we honor
this evening has dedicated him-
self, we may learn eventually
how to live 'with each other,”
th e Scripzps-Howard publisher
said. '

As president of the US. Ani-

' mal H e a 1 th '; Association, Dr.

Quinn established the first com-
mittee on Animal Welfare which
he believes is very close to Ani-
mal health. ' _'

“T h e permanent committee

develops model laws for state
and federal legislatures 1n regu- _,

lating the proper. treatment tDot
our animal friends,” Dr. Quinn
said.

“Everyone even remotely con-'

nected with animals must be en-
couraged to take part in a con-

" centrated effort to see that all
‘ animals receive decent treat-

ment, ” he said. ‘

Past wmners of the award 1n-
elude Vice-President Hubent H.
Humphrey and Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court Abe For-
tas, as well as Dr. Albert
Schweitzer who received the
first award.

Daar Jack:

I enjoyad my talk with Eleanor this morning abeut you and Er. Shaw and

I promised to sand the enclosed information about Dr. Quinn, to whom

' yan will ha presenting the Schweitaer %sdal on December 10 at 6 o'olack.

I am so dalightad that you are going to da this and look forward very
much to haaring what you will say.

'Dr. Quinn's lethar, which is enclased, gives all the information an his
baekground that you will mead and I am enclosing a faw Information Reperts
in whieh speeches or exeerpts from sneeehes are given so that yen will
have an idaa of the ceremonies held in the past.

There are two major reasons why Dr. Quinn was chasen to be tha 1968
'Schweitzer medallist. It was he aha, as President of the Un1t¢d*3tatﬂs
Animal Health Asseciation, established a standing committee on animal
walfare. This is the first time that any veterinary group bus established
such a cammittee, and I baliave the results in coming years are going to
be tremendcusly important for tha welfare 9? animals.

The United States animal Haalth.Associatian has been in axistence for
72 years. 'Its feauﬁ is chiefly on regulatary veterinary madieinn, that
is, the enforcement at laws relating to animal haalth and to the care
and treatmant of animals as in humans slaughter laws, transportation of
livestedk laws, and tha treatment of dogs, cats and other animals by
animal dealers and.rosearch institutiens.

As State Veterinarian in tha ﬁiohigan Department of Agriculture, 1}. Quinn
has been outstandingly humane and efficient. As noteé in his letter, he

is rasponsibla far Michigan laws in all the above mentioned aatagaries.
Thus his goad influence, both officially and through the veterinary organi-
zations in which he plays important ralea, has pravanted mach ueadless

 




ﬁr. Jaak Howard‘ - 2 - November 26, 1968

suffering in tha past and aan be axpactad to dc even mara in the future.

The tremandaus work done by the Animal ﬁealth DiVision of tha United ﬁtatas -
Departmeat 9f Agriculture was ra¢ognized in last yaar’s Schweitzer awara
(sea Infarmation ﬁepart, Volume 16, Ne.‘&, which is enclosed). $9 believe
that the mm 5f the committee establishad by Dr. Quinn (it is nan working
on a draft of a modal state law to complsment tha FaderAI Laboratery '
Animal welfare Act) will be a strong forea in impraving the lot at dags

and othar animals. f , '

Dr. Quinn is ahaarful aven in the face 9f opposition which inevitably arises
whenevsr efforts for animal wﬁlfare are made. I knmw he will be tremendously -
pleased to racaiva the Schwaitzar madal from yea.

'Pleasa be sure he let me know if there are othar details you vauld like.

I am sending under separate cover a copy of the book Aggggls §3Q_The1r Legal
Righgs in ease yau wish to hava a 190k at the chaptars an Laberatory-Animalf

Helfhre and an lava Regulating the sale of Small Lndmals and Birds because
that is th9 field in which Dr. Quinn‘s efforts are particularly important.

I hepe I’m not Iverwhalming ynu tco much with endlass informatinn, but I»
knew year skill in sorting out what you may want'te have and so thOught
it batter t0 send a bit more than yea would actually naed.

activities math interest. It i8” a" 5~‘” ,o toaon conservation without teaching

a love for animals.

we are all grateful to lawmakers like iDana’cmr Heft who work closely with

the Animal I“"Jcallf.zwez Institute and otherconserVation groups. The Senator was born in
1912, just 13 years aftor the f“. Q.;ﬁoﬁ€ggéf*€‘ wasshot and while there'was still

:The great naturalist Aldo LoOpold, in lamenting-the destruction of the loo
cutlcaf selphenium near his farm in tﬁsoonsin, somewhat cynically said, "lt may be
wise to prohibit all teaching of real botany and real history lost some future-Eiﬁﬁﬁx
citizen suffer qualns about the floristic price of'ﬁi his so called good life."

wore he alive today) I think Mr Leopold'would.be gratified at the rising i

interest in consorvation, not only in our country but all over tho_worldo

., then you a~a‘»~; a‘: .a” 34.; over deveIOped countries send missions to our
undenﬁelOped countries, you send technicians, economists,.and engineers but I
never see in-ﬂazx those missions conservationists and ecologists. The U. 3.
spends ho millionxi dollars annually to'contrOlpthe destruction of migratory
es birds. Those some birds spend 3 nonths a year in Colombia where they are
unprotected and thousands are being slaughtered.t Ehe skin trade is wiping out ocelots .
and jaguars in South America. The mother jaguars and ocelots are killed for skins
and the babies are sold to U. S. zoos. The export of ocelot skins alone has climbed
from 1000 a year a feW'years ago to 15,000 annually. Monkeys are exported by the
hundreds of thousands. A wooly monkey is captured by killing the mother and taking
the infant. Eight die for each one reaching the U. 3. markets. This would all stop
if the buying countries - mainly the U.S. ~ would control imports."

members of their-own species, the beasts and birds of prey are far more restrainsd

 




thanmany'of the harmless vegetarians. He points ont that the well known harbinger

of peace, the dove, is one of the crueleet of all speoies who delights in killing

ita own Species by slowly dismembering them, while the eagle is a somewhat cowordly bird’
who mates for life and often has trouble finding his way back to his nest;

The wolf, of all predating Species, has been victimized by

misinformation. There has been a bountvfon his life since ancient Ureece. Children
who will never see a wolf in the wild are taught to;hate aéd fear him when, in fact
thefe has never been a documented case of on unprovoked.attack on a human being.

I spent a summer with a néak of 13 wolves onéﬁatt Baffin Island and
found them to be.§:xth’ gentle fun loving creatures. I followed members of the pack

for days without a gun and often met them at close range. Never once was I threatened;

While the pack I followed did live on oaribou‘é/ecientific studies

have provon that door and caribou.hggg§;g herds in wolf areas are much healthier than
areas where the wolves have been killed out. .They maintain an ecological balance by

predating on the weak and diseased.

was not urged to the

House because his “He-

cati’ County” had come out

and the pornography therein

ﬁghtened presidential advis-
s.

. One can see now the possible
' headlines had the J ohnsons re—
ceived him at the White House:
“President Presents Litera-
ture Award to Author of Por-
nographic Book.”

The third recipient, W.H.
Auden, started out but “got
stuck in a snowdrift somewhat

west of Wilmington. He finally .

got here, carpet slippers and
all, just in time for a drink.”

“Last year Marianne Moore
was a star performer and ar-
rived accompanied by a crowd
of witnesses from Brooklyn
and baseball and was a great
success,” concluded Gross to a
small audience that included
author Herman Wouk and ad-
viser to the National Endow-
ment of the Arts Roger Ste-
vens.

Nancy Hanks said a few
words. So did the new bride-
groom, Quincy Mumford, Li-
brarian of Congress, who got
married on Friday but came
down with the ﬂu the next day,
so he and his attractive bride,
English born Betsy Perrin
Fox, haven’t had a honeymoon
yet. They will go on the 15th.

HANDSOME NEW Rep.
Philip Crane of Illinois, who
ran for a special election and
won Donald Rumsfeld’s seat in
the House, was at the Public
Affairs Council reception yes-
terday with his wife. Both are
young and extremely good
looking, but Washington prob-
ably will see little of them.

Raven-haired Mrs. Crane,
who has seven children, said
she will have to go right back
to Illinois, now that Phil is

h

u-’

sworn in, to campaign for his
regular primary in March. But
they plan to rent a house in
Fairfax, Va.

Sen. Mark Hatfield dropped
by this party‘in the Mayflower
Hotel, which was filled with
corporation representatives,
and said he had “pinned Tony
up at home so she couldn’t
eat.”

His wife has lost 20 pounds
on the protein diet and still is
reducing. She looks marvel-
ous, said her husband.

When the talk turned to poli-
tics, Mark was accused of
being a Democrat because he is
such a liberal Republican. But
he observed, with his winning
smile, that he is a Lincoln Re-
publican.

Treasurer of the United
States Dorothy Elston said she
signs at least 500 bills a day,
ranging in value from $1 to
$100—which is now our high-
est—for people who send them
in requesting her autograph.

She’s gotten so she can sign
them while talking on the tele-
phone and getting other work
done.

Nor is it a waste of time.
Mrs. Elston figures that every
bill someone asks her to sign
will be taken out of circulation
and thus help the fight against
inflation.

Greenbacks above $100 were
discontriue-d, she said, because.
only gamblers used them.

Rep. and Mrs. Clark Mac-
Gregor, that attractive and

courageous pair from Minnew

sota also were there. They are
considered courageous be-
cause it is presumed Hubert
Humphrey will run for the
Senate this coming year and
Clark is going to run against
him. '
“But Hubert hasn’t an-

nounced ye,” smiled Clark
looking unworried.

CHRISTINA FORD wants to
come to the Symphony Ball
Friday at the Sheraton Park,
according to the Marquesa de
Merry del Val.

Apparently, the sensational-
ly attr a c tive, much-liked
member of the International
Jet Set had so much fun here
last year that she’s all for a
return engagement.

There is supposed to be a
group of friends involved in

the ball-trotting With her, but ‘

Henry was not expected.

The ball committee, headed
by Barbara Burris, is ready to
accommodate her with or
without friends, with places

for two or a whole table, how- '

ever she desires, at the regu-
lar price, of course.

A party with the bubbling,
chic Christina is a better par-

ty.
, STAN WAYMAN. the tall,
distinguished l o o kin g and
bearded Life photographer,
who has lived close to ani-
mals, will receive the
Schweitzer Award for 1969 to-
night at a party staged by the
Roger Stevens in St. John’s
Parish House in Georgetown.
No longer having the David
Bruce abode, Christine (Ste-
vens, the nation’s prime mov-
er behind improving the lot of
mistreated animals and con-
serving their species, said
their c u r r e n t Georgetown

house is too small for the num-
bers expected.

Sen. Philip Hart, who has
been behind good animal legis-
lation, will make the presenta-
tion of the Animal Welfare In-
stitute’s award to Stan.

Wayman’s the man who pho-
tographed the pitiful “concen-
tration camp for dogs” for
Life that led to the dognaper

act. ,

He has lived in the Baffin
Bay area of the Arctic for
weeks with only wolves as his
companions and said they

Another
Inaugural?

—-But Yes

“The First Anniversary In-
augural Ball’ will be held in
the Regency Room of the Shore-
ham Hotel on Jan: 21, with ‘
Mamie Eisenhower and Wil-
lard Marriott as honorary co- ‘
chairmen.

The let was chosen instead
of the 20th because the Regen-
cy Room was taken for that
night, but not by the man most
entitled to celebrate—Richard
Nixon.

It’s premature to say wheth-
er or not the Nixons will at-
tend the ball, said executive
director Bob Diefenbach, but
this columnist knows the Pres-
ident has the date marked on
his calendar.

The big subscription affair is
planned as a fund-raiser for
Eisenhower College, Seneca
Falls, N.Y., so at least it will
be a family affair.

CONRAD AIKEN, the
80—year-old poet and novelist
Who won this year’s National
Medal for Literature did not
come to Washington to receive
it yesterday, but a bevy of
brains banded together to do
him honor.

Aiken, who remained in
Brewster, Vt., because he is
“sick and shy,” expressed his
feelings when he was present-
ed with the accompanying
$5,000 prize on Nov. 17.

But yesterday, down at the

nolo-gy, new director Daniel
mology, new director Danile
Boorstin, the noted historian
opened the program of trib-
utes.
. Then came Witty Mason
Gross, president of Rutgers
University, who described the
difficulties of connecting the
authors each year with the
$5,000 awarded by the National
Book Committee.

The first recipient, he said,
was Thornton Wilder, a sweet
and cooperative man who
came to the White House to
receive it.

The second was “Edmund
Wilson Who was ill, unmoved
and unmovable at the prospect ,
of coming to Washington.” He
did, however, “condescend to
accept the $5,000 somewhat
grumpily and was‘glad it was x»
tax free.” ' "

It seems, said Gross, that
