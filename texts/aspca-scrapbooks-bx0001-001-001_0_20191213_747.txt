At a recent meeting of the Oxford Club, E. I
A. Blakelee read a paper on “ The Whipping Post,” the
substance of which is as follows : -

To advocate the whipping post for crime in this day l
of enlightenment and reﬁnement would provoke holy
horror, and we should be asked, “ Would you degrade
humanity?” But with full certainty that the proper
consideration of the subject will change the view of
. ”‘most thinkers, I claim that for Wife heaters, sneak

';thieves, parents who cruelly abuse children, pocket-
‘ book snatchers, scamps who insult ladies in cars and on
the streets, the whipping post is the only remedy that
will eﬂ'ectually check the evil without making the law-
less more lawless, and without putting a tax upon soci-
ety. I claim that the present mode of punishment does
.not produce the desired result, but adds to rather than
. diminishes crime. You ask. how ‘1' I answer, first, by
association, while in conﬁnement; second, by edu-
' outing the criminal to depend upon others for support
and to undervalue law and authority. " ‘
Prison reform thus far has proved a fallacy—very
good to talk about, but practically a failure. Go into
.7 our police courts of a morning. Who are the offend-
ers? The same old names are heard. “Here, again,
Michael, or Mary,” says the J udge—“ten days. Pass
along another. Here again. Looney-—-ten days,” and so
- on to the end of the chapter—each time sent up ten
days, to be fed and housed at the public expense, no '
one beneﬁting but the sheriff, who gets 75 cents
for bringing a prisoner before the magistrate
and seventy-ﬁve cents for taking him back, and an
allowance for feeding him; while the magistrate is
paid by the people, as well as the policeman who arrests.
What an absurdity l Laws should be formed as a safe-
guard against the vicious and to protect those who
reapect society and its rights; whereas, now, the,
honest, industrious, law abiding taxpayer has to bear).
the expense and is poorly protected, while the criminal»
is made more vicious. Take for instance. a cowardly.
brute, who beats his wife, ﬁnefhim ten' dollars andt

”paltry must be pushed acids; the necessity de-
" dapractical handling, and as Henry Bergh’slaw
‘ repeaters is now in Albany and will come up
inter, I suggest that we, as a club, consider how
meson support him. Let us make a beginning.
Ehe'donciusion of Mr. Blahslce’s remarks he was
~1yapplauded, and a. general informal discussion of
,..v8n.bj‘ect followed.
Majorm. G. Constable thought ﬂogging would prove
‘eshﬁfa’sareformatory measure. He cited his own
,rije'nce as an ofﬁcer of the British Army in India,
reggthis; punishment was resorted to for every petty
lite, and told some very interesting anecdotes.
:J'JJG’oombs, Commodore W. H. Thompson, E. B.
lefr, '1‘. S. Knapp, L. ‘M. Bacon, James Mitchell
, 9thers then took part in the discussion.
‘ “allusion to the cognate subject of corporal pun-
«out in schools brought out Professor Calvin, Pat-
u'n,‘ who thought that only very extreme cases could
T‘r‘tgﬁit, and that then its reformatory inﬂuence
didepeud entirely upon- the subsequent treatment
' prit and not upon the punishment itself. It
just nover‘be advisable, said Mr. Patterson,

Vei when the Q1"u110gate 'el’erred to the establish-
ment of the whipping post to check wife beating.

duced in the Leglslature by a leading member from
Hudson county. 'l‘he gentleman referied to was
Counsellor William Mcidoo, a prominent Jersey
City lawyer and the democratic Assemblyman from
the Eighth district.

THE PROPOSED MEASURE. '

The HERALD reporter yesterday called at the resi-
dence of Air. McAdoo and opened the conversation
by asking,1n relation to the proposed bill, it it was:

of this crime, the innate viciousness and brutality
it bespea ks, the helplessness of the victim, the
te1r1b1e inﬂuence on the young: family 01 the brutal
husband and the beaten and sometimes brutalizod
wife seeking relief in drinking intoxicants. and the
upplrent uselessness of imprisonment in well
warmed and ventilated and comfortable prisons as
a preventative or deterrent, have, I think. aroused
the public mind and made this demand for the
whipping post. I would not wish to father such a
bill unless I felt that public opinion would back it.
In this State the leadin‘r newspapers or both parties
have expressed seemingly favorable views. I am

aware that in some places and States, especially at ,
the North, them is a sentimental and semi-political .

objection to the w hippiwr post as a general let'orma-
tory measure, but when a crime like this cannot be
checked by the ordinary punishments of law I think
public opinion, if not .111 eadv favorable, could readily
be won by the p1ess 1'01 heroic tieatlnent of this 2001.11
cancer. Many a. wife murder might be prevented if
the husband in the initial cruelty had a public whip.
ping,r by a good stout under slieriif. As to imprison-
ment 1 11111 afraid some brutal and revenget‘ul hus-
bands ﬁnl solace in this, that while so imprisoned
their very punishment opeiates doubly against the

injured w1fe by leaving 1161 \chout support. I»

know of cases, as a lawx er, wheie women who were
cruelly treated by their husbands,
applied to the Chancellor for what, and, having
been granted a fail alimony for support, the wicked
and revengeful husbands actually attempted to
quickly and riotously 1eiluce themselves to abject
poverty that they might be able to say they could not
supnort the 111.9. 9

FEATURES OF THE BILL.

“What features would you incorporate in it?”

“Well, I should restrict it to wife beating. I will
look at the statutes prevailing in the States of Vir-
ginia. and Delaware— which, by the way, have little
or none of such crimes-and model my bill some-
what upon them. My aim will be to make the crime

\odious and to prevent, deter and wipe it out. As
to unlimited publicity of the whipping there are
arguments both ways, and I am not yet determined.

For the present I would have it apply to second

oﬂenCes. The people of New Jersey are conserva-

esty and candor, and I don’t know but that it' passed
and successful they may extend its provisions to
defaulting and corrupt ofﬁcials and bank cashiers,
and thus preserve the honor and good name 01 this

Com nionwealth.”

Police Justice Stilsiug said that on an average he
had a wife-beater arraigned in his court daily. The
wives who caused the arrests of their nugnacious
lords were invariably in a melting,y mood and disin-
clined to press the complaint at the examination,
and were ready to become responsible lor their fu-

‘ ture good behavior. Only aggravated cases were
Sent to the Grand Jury for consideration, and the
majority were released on giving bonds to keep the
peace.

A number of lawyers, when questioned, concurred
in the views of Assemblyman McAdoo, and approved _
of the public ﬂogging of brutal husbands as the
only remedy for wife-beating. Several have the im-
pression that the measure will have little or no 0p-
pbsitiOn it introduced, and will meet with the ap-
proval of Governor Ludlow.

Mr. McAdoo was, at the session of thelower House
of the Legislature yesterday, made chairman of the
Committee on Judiciary, and a friend, who is in a
position to know, asserted that the Whipping Post

bill would be early presented to the Assembly.
possibly this week.

LONG ISLAND dirt-gulls. 27. 1882.
Cruelty to Annuals.

Patrick Burns was brought before Judge Lclehant y
last Friday charged with cruelty to animals. From
the statement of the witnesses it seems that Burns
bought a horse. or at least a. substitute for one, and
, the poor thing broke down completely soon after it
came into Burns possession. The latter at once
turned the animal out into the streets to eat snow
balls or die. The unlortunate beast wandered
§ around for a time, until his terribly emaciated con-
tdition attracted the attention of the police and
residents of the neighborhood, and the attention or
f Mr. Henry P. Titus was called to the case. Mr.
Titus represents the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals and he caused Burns to be ar-
. rested. When before the Justice Burns said he paid
; “ twenty shillings ” for the animal, but found it
‘ “ no good ” and turned him loose. Judge Dele-

 

imprisoned in the County Jail for ten days. Burns
ﬂ said he would not pay a cent ﬁne and would rather
, serve out his time in the jail. He is serving it.

[Lecture by Henry Burgh—Remarks by
I .
the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher—Mr.

Bank’s Humanitarian Principles
Commended.

Henry Bergh delivered his lecture on
“Vivisectlon Dissected,” at Historical Hall last evening,
before a large audlcncc. There were many Long Island

3 College students in attendance, but they did not follow
I the example of the New York students, for Mr. Borgh

 

 

, received a most patient hearing and was frequently cp-
‘ plaudcd. Rev. Henry Word Beecher occupied the
chair, and introduced Mr. Borgh with a few graceful
and culogistlc remarks, taking occasion to denounce
the interruptions he received in New York I few even-
, inns ago.
‘ It seems strange, said Mr. Beecher, that c popu-
lcr assemblage is called together to adjudicate in it
matter which is generally regarded as of professional
I interest alone. tic supposed that those who know ,
! most about it, physicians, physiologists and scientiﬁc ‘
i

 

l
men, are best qualiﬁed to pass impartial judgment. l
And yet it might almost be said that the cause of rcfor- ,
. motion generally came from the outside and that the ’
reform from within followed. If they had waited for J
great commercial truths to be enunciated by merchants I
they would have had to wait a long time. Legal ad-
Vances have been in many cases brought about by men
who won not professional lawyers and oven in the
church reformations have resulted, from the application ,
of what are called inﬁdels. I know no living man, I
continued Mr. Beecher, so well ﬁtted to discuss this
question of vivisection as Mr. Bergh, by reason of his
” experience, courage and fortitude. The humane senti-
ment in New York and Brooklyn has been raised .

VIVISECTION DISSEO’I‘ED.

The subject he said, was not a cheerful one. . It is
tragedy from beginning to end and has not a particle of
mirth m it. But dismal though the story is, it-must
be listened to. Day and night have for centuries been
made hideous by the slaughter of dumhcresturcs.
The question to be discussed divides itself under
-three heads: First—Have gainful experiments on

animals been of any scienti c beneﬁt to mankind?

Second—Granting that they have, could they not hcvc

been arrived at by other experiments? Third—Are
3 such experiments morally justiﬁable, and is not their
:‘ tendency to harden all those who take part in them ?
‘ He maintained that it was at least an open question
Lwhether medical science had made any progress since

'J‘ tloned the names of several distinguished physicians 3

' the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher—Mr.
Bornh’s Humanitarian Principles
Commended.

Henry Bergh delivered his lecture on
“Viviscotlon Dissected,” at Historical 11111 last evening,
before a large audience. There were many Long Island
College students in attendance, but they did not follow
the example of the New York students, for Mr. Bergh

plauded. Rev. Henry Ward Beecher occupied the
chair, and introduced Mr. Bergh with a few graccful ,
and euloglstic remarks, taking occasion to denounce
the interruptions he received in New York 3 few even-
inns ago.

It seems strange, said Mr. Beecher, that c popu-
lar assemblage is called together to adjudicate in I
matter which is generally regarded as of professional
interest alone. tic supposed that those who know
most about it, physicians, physiologists and scientiﬁc J
men, are best qualiﬁed to pass impartial judgment.
And yet it might almost be said that the cause of refor-
mation generally came from the outside and that the
reform from within followed. If they had waited for
great commercial truths to be enunciated by merchants
they would have had to wait a long time. Legal ad- '
Vances have been in many cases brought about by men
who were not professional lawyers and oven in the
church reformations have resultod'from the application
of what are called inﬁdels. I know no living man, 3
continued Mr. Beecher, so well ﬁtted to discuss this
question of vivisection as Mr. Borgh, by reason of his

ment in New York and Brooklyn has been raised

years ago had no rebuke are now forbidden;
associations like the one he has organized, have been
established in every large city in this country and
across the see. So much has the world been inﬂuenced
that his badge of oiﬁco has been capied in Europe and
has become the property of the world. It was left {Or
New York to attempt to stop the voice of this phil a.
thropist. An audience largely made up of medical i!- .
dents ﬁlled up the full measurc of their chemo by
stamping and rattling their canes. In doing this they
used that end of themselves most vital. They had
little to do with their heads and much with their foot.
How much better for my friend to have had such mm
for his hearers than for his physicians. This brutal
disposition on the part of the lower portion of the
medical students needs no further exposition. I regret
that so far no apology has been made for the conduct
of these students.

the ﬁrst branch of his subject, Mr. Bergh detailed some
of the tortures inﬂicted on animals by vivxsectors, and
claimed that the experiments had not conferred any
truly scientiﬁc beneﬁts to the world. Practical
physiology is a. solecicm and not a. science. He
had endeavored to prove by the declarations and
confessions of scientiﬁc men that vivisection was of no
real value, and in closing his lecture he conﬁned him-
self to the moral side of the question, contending that
from this point of view such experiments were not
justiﬁable. How are these wrongs to be righted ‘2 By

l"; 7 THE onions OF HIS SOCIETr—A LETTER
"2 iFROM POSTMASTEB PEARSON. ’

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OE J
' ORUELTY TO ANIMALS, Feb. 28, 1882.
TO THE EDITOB OF THE HERALDt— .
Your editorial of to—day, entitled “Delaying the
Vu’y’Mail,” is so accurately stated in its legal relations
‘ “that it is hardly nosessary for me to do more than
to explain the occurrence which occasioned it.
‘ In; the case of the United States vs. Kirby the
Supreme Court ruled, after citing the act:—

That section applies only to those who know that the
acts performed by them, obstructing or retarding the as-
sage of the mail, or of its carrier, Will have that e ect.
and perform them with the intention that such shall be
' their operation, and also when the acts which create the
obstruction are in themselves unlawful the intention to
obstruct will beimputed to their author, although to at-
tain other ends Inayhave been his primary object. The
statute has no reference to acts lawful in themselves, from
_ the executioigot' which a temporary delay to the mails un-
avoidablyﬁollows.

The logic and justice of this is that no contractor
Or mail carrier or driver shall violate any law of the
[ State through which the mail is being carried, and

that every employé of the federal government is

1 just as responsible for the criminality of his acts as
is the humblest citizen of the State. To rule other-
v‘ise would tend to the overthrow of all State
authority.
“ rl‘he State of New York has enacted certain laws

for the protection of animals, and has aﬁixed appro-
"priate penalties for their violation. Authority has
also been given to the society I represent to enforce
those laws.

,On Sunday, the 26th inst., a horse was found at-
tached to one of the mail wagons having a large
sunken ulcer underneath the harness, and one of
our olhcers detained the animal, and after making

suitable provision for forwarding the mail the
1 driver was arrested in the usual legal way. Hun-

‘l dreds of. similar cases transpire during the year
,. where private citizens are the oifenders, and neither
: law nor justice takes into account who the party
' may be. The mail contractor of this city is well
I paid by the government for the proper performance
\ W of his duty, and if he fails from any cause to trans-
, ‘ port the mails by compelling horses to do the work
j which they are clearly unfit to do or from any
3‘ other cause, it surely is not the fault of this society.

In 1878 a similar case arose by reason of the dere-
liction of the same Contractor (Otis), and the Post-
master General, by a letter to the undersigned, re-
buked that person, thereby approving of our action.
As to your plea that the driver had but a few blocks
to go and that the ofﬁcer might ride to the place of

; destination and _then arrest, is unreasonable, as that
would constitute him an accomplice in the act of
cruelty.

Seventeen years of interrupted labor and experi-
ence in the duties assigned to this society, have
trained its oﬁicers in the requirements of their ser-

‘ ; Vice, and although at times the rights of the public
.< 1. may seem to be infringed by it, a fair and intelligent
renew of the facts have invariably shown that the
laws have been faithfully and forbearingly exe-'
cuted. HENRY BEBGH, President.

A young lady, perhaps eighteen years old,

appeared in Justice liaeher’s court this morning, to
swear out a. complaint against Peter McGlover for
“cruelly torturing and causing to suffer an animal

to wit, a cat."

The young lady in question resides in

a brown stone front house on South Ninthrstreet and is

well known in social circles of the Eastern District.
She owned a Maltese cat of which she was very fond.

In the adjoining house boarded Mr. licGlover,

The

shot was not immediately fatal, but poor Tom lingered
with a great ugly wound in his side for several hours
before death released him of his misery. In the mean-

BERGH’S LATEST MOVE.

Solomon May, the largest dealer of cattle in

marl; (hf Bergh’s Society for
W ,

.L‘n'er are two reasons y the Law- snould be
enforced. One is that it was for this special "
purpose that the Society had the law enacted; as,
there had been many complaints made of the“
suffering of these poor animals. , ' ’ ‘ , .
. Another is that when cows are left in this con? -
dition they suffer lo a. certain extent from in~
ﬂemmation, and the animal does not recover
from this before it is slaughtered. It is almost
imposmble to detect this condition after the ani-
malls lulled, yet presumably it is the cause of
many diseases among people. ' -

Therefore the Society has taken up the mat-.

ter, and has determined to prosecute and hays
punlshed to the full I

to inﬂict a. heavy punishment upon you. as you

have plead guilty, and have been brought here I
to bring the law to public attention. Your ﬁne‘
IS one dollar. Now that the law is before the
pubhc, I give notice that the next. offender.
brought before me will receive punishment that
he will long remember. / ‘
Another point about this I wish to speak of is
the mllk. After a cow becomes bagged the milk
1s inﬂamma‘m‘ry in its nature, and causes the
summer complaint in children. I shall insist '
that the milk taken from the cows shall not be"
given to any human being. It is too frequentl ’
put 11) other milk. The punishment in any cage,

of this kind coming to my knowledge will be ’
most severe.

NEW YORK, Jul 31, 1882.

To House Surgeon Dr. Jersey, Chambers treet Hospi-
tal N. Y. . Sir;

_'l"his communication is addressed to you on the presump-
tion that the extract which occasions it is true,and was taken
from the MERCURY of yesterday, July 30. If. therefore,
the barbarous and uncivrlized act was performed by you,
or. With your assent. I do not hesitate to say that it fur-
nishes the most ample evrdence that you are unﬁt to be
mtrusted' with the care of the unfortunate human beings
whom rrnstortune exposes to your merciless treatment.
The md1v1dual— for will not call him man—that can
make a farce of the dying agomes of a dumb creature in
the way you are des cribed With doing and for no ot or
cause than giving expression to its grief at the departure
of its master, With whom .it had been long associated,merits
the execratlon of mankind, and should be immediately
removed from the peculiar position you hold. If you can
thus deliberately sport With the aﬁeotions as well as suﬁ'er-
mgs of animals, you furnish the best evidence of the truth
of the old charge that your profession is a cruel one, for it
upholds vivisection. and in your case, murders those in-
stincts which are the highest attributes of man and ani-
mals. Such a one would be out of place even in a slaughter
house, and is better suited for the duties of a stone
quarry. Yours, eto., HENRY BERGE.

Ofﬁcer Frank Clark, the efﬁcient agent of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ar- ‘
rested Thomas McCormick, of No. 287 Bedford avenue,
yesterday. It appears that he was excavating a cellar at
the corner of Broadway and Ditmar street. Attached
to a cart was a horse with a very sore back, which was
chafed and irritated by the harness. It had also a
deep cut on the fore leg. The horse very naturally re-
fused to work. But his driver, McCormick, was de-
termined the animal should pull the load of dirt to
which he was attached, and so placing one end of a ‘
large iron chain around the horse’s neck, he fastened ,
the other end to another cart with a team attached, and
in this brutal way attempted to compel the sick horse
to drag its burden. Oﬁlcer Clark arrived in time to
liberate the animal from his chains and to march the ,
cruel master to the station house. This morning the
prisoner offered as an excuse for his actions that he
only wanted to' scarethe horse. He was fined $5, as Was
also his father, John McCormick, who was driving ‘a
lame horse. ' ‘ ‘ ‘

The case of the people vs. Ormond Wolfe,‘jf

charged With bleeding the tails of steers at his
jfather’s slaughter house, No. 222 North Ninth .
street, in order to render their ﬂesh whiter, ,
‘came up before Justice Naeher this morning. ”
It was the ﬁst of the two cases against the .
Wolfe Brotheis who, it is alleged, were discov-

ered on October 25 in the process of doing the
bleeding. The fact was not denied, but the de‘:
:fense insisted that the action charged by the"
proséccuticn and acknowledged by the defense

did not come under the proper interpretation
of cruelty in the statute. - Mr. Bergh, the Presirj
dent of the S. P. O T. A., appeared to look out A.

for the inte1ests of the pi oseLution, and (loun—
selor George H F 1she1 appemed 1’01 the defense;_
Mr. BerghD in introducing the case said that in,
the present charge, the c1uelty of which Wolfe
was accused had not even the poor apology of
So- CALLED NECESSITY ;
for the best physmlovists said that the ﬂesh of 2
he bullocks was data 101 ated by the precess of
leeding. He called Special Ofﬁcer Frank O
Glauke as his ﬁrst witness.
Ofﬁcer Olarlge testiﬁed to the fact of his having :

 

isited the \Voli'e slaughter house on Nort hf"

inth street, in company with Health Inspector ~

Hobday, and of having ultncssed the bleeding .
He exhibited the knife which was used ,

1ocess.
'on the occasion spoken of and also thought up
a bloody steer’ s tail for the examination of the
court.

Mr. Fisher—-“Is that one of the tails cut 1),

“No sil, ”said Mr. Claike, “but it was an ilk?-

eating, but he had done it to make the meat
better. The process was not unusual ; he be-
lieVed that every butcher in the business had
done it; he had seen it done in the establishment

1 examination the following questions were asked:
Mr. Bergh-—-You do not think this a painful
operation ? .

* Witness—Not so much so as twisting the ani:
mals’ tails.
, Mr. Bergh-How do you get your informa-
Wb. tion on that subject?

:Vitness—I judge from the way the bullocks

ac . '
Mr. Bergh—How do they act ?

 

’ 4’59
the ~

Witness—Well. some of them start forward a.

little, others make no mot-ion at all and do not
seem to feel it in any way. 7 _ ,

, 'Mr. Bergh—How plentifully do the animals
bleed ? 7 V
f Witness—I should say about half a wine glass-

111.

Mr. Bergh—Ii’. as I understood your direct
testimony, the bullochs weigh, on an averad,
1,000 pounds, is half a wineglassful of blo

. ,_ enough to help their overheated condition ?
-5 Witness—I think so, certainly.
1.91 Mr. Bergh (fiercely)~——Don’t you think that

you are preperly named “Wolf ‘2”

Mr. Fisher-I object to the gentleman’s

question. I would not allow any counsel, and I
will not allow Mr. Bergh, to abuse my witness'-
in that way. , '

too, if I wanted to retort. ,
L Mr. Bergh———Oh, well, let that pass; my re~

" mark was only a little pleasantly which I with-
draw. I am through with the witness. ,

who testiﬁed that the bleeding was not detri-
mental to the flesh as human food. Mr. Meyer
Wright testiﬁed to the same effect and sereral
other witnesses corroborated the testimony. The
defense then rested its case, after which. Mr.
Fisher summed up for his client and Mr. Bergh
for the prosecution. The defendant was found

‘ fellow Whom I knew to be a notorious doe; ﬁghter .._' a
was introduced to me as agentleman from Chicago, '
who Was prospecting for the purchase of property
adjoining Flaherty’s.
“ ‘I guess I’ve stopped your fun for to—day,’ I said. F"
to this so-called gentleman on a prospecting tour.” gag...
“Oh, I didn’t come to attend the cock light." re- ' :i
.plied my worthy acquaintance. hastily. . »
"Who said you did?” I replied, and he slunk ~ .
away, muttering. “I guess I’ve given the whole ‘,
snap aWay.”

     

A SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE.
Mr. Flaherty then took me all through his house, i
and to a big disused brewery, saying that he didn’t
own the brewery, and I then said that I didn't want ' ‘
to see it. His stable was what I Wanted to visit,
and he said he would get the keys to take me
through the stable, but I haven’t seen him since. ,
AT ms: COCK PIT. __
“There was only one entrance to the stable, and
Ihad to break into it. As I expected it was fitted "
up for cock and dog ﬁghts. It was celled up on
all sides. Seats were ranged about the sides
amphitheatre like, and in the centre was a ring
splattered with blood. An improvised candelabra
Was smspcnded from the ceiling over the centre of ,,
the pit. The stable is situated in a. thick 3
Woods, the wildest kind of a place, i '
. 500 feet from the inn. - To save the trouble of i
going to the inn during a light a. bar was rigged up
in one corner of the stable, with glasses and bot.
ties and little tubs of water. On one side of the
stable were rows of coops containing lighting cocks
with their weight marked on the outside of each
coop. There were scales and everything for pre- ,
paring the cocks for a light.” '~‘
PICKETS AND BLOODHOU'NDS. -;
"Where were the dogs?” asked the HERALD re- :~
Ol‘tera
p ”Running loose in the yard. Do you know how : 1
these lights have been so successfully carried on .3;
lor so long? Well, all tickets were sold at the inn
bar. Between the inn and the stable half a dozen '93-.
plcliets were stationed. by whom every ticket-
l_m..ler had to pass. Nobody could buy a ticket un-
n-ss he was vouched for by some well known sport-
lug character. Then, there were bloodhounds
stationed around the outside of the stable to re-
muve any prying individual who might come
lmtering around the neighborhood. The tickets, I
learned, sold for from $2 to $55 apiece, and Fla-
lmrty, who owned lots of dogs, would get up a. ﬁght
eyery now and then, advertising it to take place at 31'
an early hour, and, of course, raking in a fortune
from his guests while they were waiting for the
light to begin, several hours later. It was a prelim-
ble business, and might have been carried on for a
1012:; while had not these sporting men become too
reckless. One night a number of lovers of the ﬁght
went through an old farmer’s vineyard in Wood- _

7. WAR AGAlliST SWILL MILK.

 

=Oiﬁcer Clark, of the Brooklyn Society for the Pro-
yention of Cruelty to Animals, in conjunction with
the Health authorities of that city, is waging a. war
Iageinst milk dealers who feed their co 1. s on distil-

ler waste or swill. The cases of sixteen offenders
have recently been reported, and it is probable that
a. cb‘pviction will be secured in each case. Olli-
cer Clark says that when the fermented grain
1 or distillery reins e is placed before a. fresh cow the
' animal refuses to eat it. She is kept without other
ﬁQod, however, and ﬁnally becomes so hungry that
he eats it to keep from starving. It is the inten-

',tion of the authorities to continue the work until

the practice is broken up.

this morning, exhibited 011 Fulton street,- opposite the
City Hall. It is a large, strongyehiclc,» boxed to the
height of about three feet, and containing amovable
flooring, which can be drawn out upon the street, so that
V , in case a horse is so disabled that it cannot Walk into the
ambulance, it can be thus placed inside with little
trouble, The vehicle is kept on Schermerhorn street,
near Nevins, and there is nocharge made for its use.
" Cases of accidents to horses on the streets will be at-
” tended to on notice being sent to the ofﬁce of the so-
ciety, No. 415 Fulton street, which is in charge of Mr.
J. R. Pye. Disabled horses picked up on the
streets will be taken to the places desig-
nated by their owners for treatment, or will
be killed by agents of the society if the
, circumstances shall demand it. Mr. Pye was pres-
ent this morning, and explained the workings of
the ambulance to a crowd of spectators. Mayor Low
looked on from his oﬁice Window. Two of these
:vehicles are in use in New York, and. the want of one
in this city has long been felt. It will be of great as-
?sistance to the society in the prosecution of their noble
lri‘work in Brooklyn.

Mr. Berg‘h’s Ofﬁcers Order the Sick 1111;?
mals to be Put to Death-The Nature of
the Terrible Melody.

The Fatal and Contagious Disease DlS-
covered In a Crowded Car Stable.

 

An alarming report comes from Mr. L. Mc- '
Lean, the veterinary surgeon of the Board of Health.-
During a late inspection of the car stables of the city,j';;,
he found that one- of the most loathsome and deadly
diseases to which the horse is liable, the glanders, has
broken out in Brooklyn In the Bergen street car
stables where there are 150 herses quartered, he found
that seven of the horses were so badly infected with the
glanders that it w as found necessary to put them to death
and a number of fresh cases of the disease have, as al-
leged, broken out in this stable since the seven animals 1‘
. were destroy ed. The stable keepers of the Bergen line 4.‘

me doing everything possible to prevent the spread of
the fatal disease among the horses, but it seems to i
. have already obtained an alarming headway. The 1
horses destroyed in the Bergen street stables were
3 put to death by Mr. Bergh’s ofﬁcers. Mr.
McLean visited the other car stables in the
5 city and found a very suspicious case, which he be...
‘ lieves will develop into glanders, at the DeKalb avenue;
stables, where 380 horses are quartered. If the disease".
. breaks out in this last named stable, Mr. McLean be— »
'lieves itwill be found very difﬁcult to keep it from
spreading ameng the large number of horses quartered !

Why Officer Charles F. Mocks.

Quitted the City.

 

SI It is Alleged that he Leaves Several Wives
Behind Him and is Accompanied in His
_ , Flight by a Young Girl—A Police Ofﬁcer
who is Not- a Credit to the Force.

At Police Headquarters to-day, inquiry was
made about ofﬁcer Charles F. Mocks. Mr. Meeks was
employed by Mr. Bergh, the President of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and came
1 over to Brooklyn when the Societys’ branch ofﬁce was

established here. He has been regarded as smith.-
E ful and competent ofﬁcer, and his reputation stood A 1
t in the ofﬁce. He was of medium height, had blue eyes
‘ and a mustache that was a. few degrees removed in color

from a ﬁery red. Likewise his face was very highly
colored, liken. good meerschaum should be, only the
tints did not eminatc from the some source. It seems
that some years ago Mr. Mocks married a. very respect‘
l able young girl and settled down with her (for a time)
‘ at Rehway, N. J. Five children which were born
to them are still alive. Three or four years ago
Mocks left his family and came to New York
1 from Rahway. He got in the employment. of Mr. Bergh
and ﬁnally came to Brooklyn. He had not been in this
city long when he became acquainted with a Miss Hyde,
Nellie Hyde, and he wooed, Wen and married her. She

- young lady whose respectability and good qualities were

unquestioned. But Mr. Mocks does not seem to have been
satisﬁedreven' yith two wives, and while one of them
was unconscious that her husband had another in New
Jersey he 'was traveling around with other women in

] Brooklyn, and this foot gave considerable annoyance

‘and caused e. gOQId deal bf chagrin to Mrs. Mocks No. 2.
She knew her husband’s faults, as she Supposed,- but she
; ney‘e’r dreamed trial-liq had deceived her so coldly and

CT Would be judged, 71.7.7777 of hér husband’s weakness for
Athe sex; an she intimated that lie never would have left
her if he hadn’t become enamored by some other wom-
, an; and she informed him of her determination to ﬁnd
out where he had been and if ihere was a woman in the
’ case to expose him then and there. Even she did not
dream that he had married a second time—the full injus.
tice that he had done to her was not then suspected. He
how ever, foresaw what was to come, and he made up
his mind to leave Brooklyn as quickly as he had left
Rahway and as quietly too. To allay any suspicion in
the ofﬁce he informed the superintendent of the society
for this city that he felt sick, and was going to remain
at home for a day or two until he get well. Then he
stole away, and the police have been. asked to try and
ﬁnd his whereabouts.

The ﬁrst thing that was known of his absence was on
7 Tuesday, the 5th of this month—he went away Satur-
day. His second wife called at the ofﬁce and wanted to
know where he was, as he had not been home in three
days. She was told all they knew about him,
and that was that he had left on Saturday
stating that he was sick and was going
home. Instead of that he had never been
home at all. Mrs. Meeks the second became alarmed,
and didn’t know what to make of it, and then she heard

 

 

about his ﬁrst wife’s visit to the Society’s ofﬁce and that ‘

explained matters. She went into h ysteric s and her faint
ily are swearing vengeance. If they lay hold of Meeks he
will be lucky to escape with his life. Even this, however,
was not the worst part of the business. The captivating
ofﬁcer had still another damsel on a string. The ethos of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is in
Fulton street, opposite Boerum place, and the rooms
occupied front on Fulton street. On the same ﬂoor, in
the rear, is Glen’s shirt factory. In this place a num-
ber. of good looking girls are employed, and one
of them, Ada Lyons, fell in love with Ofﬁcer
Meeks. He passed the rooms where she worked
daily and went out nightly as her escort. It was well
known that Mocks had made a “mash” with Ada, who,
. it is said, was more deeply in love with him than he
was with her. She lived down in Sands street,
and whether she went oﬁ' with him or not
is not such an absolute eertai nty as to be

    
      
     
       
       
     
      
      

 

 

 

        
       
       
   

-. 71 the second of the month, and ﬁve days after—on the

‘-’:’i{ moth—Ada was missing too, and neither of them
h ‘6 been heard from since. The goner a1 impression is
that they have gone off together. Meek’s ﬁrst wife
having discovered his perﬁdy is bound to punish him
if she 0-11 get a chance, and the second wife will help
.her in the t direction all she can.

At the ofﬁce of the society where he worked, the gen-
tleman in charge had nothing to say. “I am not fa-
miliar enough with the facts, ” he said, “to speak of
them. All I know is what I have overheard in conver-
sation about the matter in the ofﬁce, but the points you
mention are about as I understand them to be. ” A de—

scription of Mocks has been given to the police and he
_ will be arrested if he can be captured. ,

A DETACHMENT OF BERGH‘S OFFICERS AIDED BY
THE POLICE MAKE A DESCENT UPON KEARNEY’S
liljtrigl;o 'ﬂ

Shortly after twelve o’clock last night Ser-
geant Carroll who was on duty at the Astoria.
Police Station received information through
the telephone that a. cock-ﬁght was in pro-
gress at Michael Kearncy’s Hotel, on Jackson
avenue. The notiﬁcation came from Ofﬁcer
Evens, Assistant - Superintendent of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani-
muls. The ofﬁcer said he had six men with
him from the Society but he needed the as-
sistance of the police force of this city. He
only required one ofﬁcer, however, and he
requested permission to draw the ofﬁcer on
duty utVernon avenue off his post.

The requsst erS instantly granted, and
Officer Weddell, who was on that post, accom-
panied Superintendent Evans. ‘v'Vheu they
arrived in the vicinity of Kearney’s place
Evans blew a whistle and they were joined by
a. party of six men who had been concealed
near the ruilroml track in the rear of the
house. The newcomers were Ofﬁcers Sey—
mour, Clark, Lsmbert, Snowdco,L0pez and
Glover.

After a. brief consultation between the odi-
cars it was decided to try and eﬁ'ect unen-
trsncc into the house from the rear. The
upper portions of the building were in total
. darkness. The blinds were closely drawn and
, not a my of light was perceptible from the
street, neither were there any sounds that
would indicate a cock ﬁght taking place with-
in. In a. little while a. men opened the rear
. door and walked unsuspectineg into the
yard, leaving the door open. The ofﬁcers
immediately made a rush for the door

 

 

 

 

 

 

and in a. moment lead full posses-
sion of the house. Upon proceeding

to the. second ﬂoor they found a. number of
men congregated but there Were no indica-
tions of s cock—ﬁght. The ofﬁcers arrested
several of the men whom they found in this
room and tool; them to the Astoria station
house. They gave their names and addresses
as follows:

John Welsh, No. 77 Railroad avenue, Bridge-
port, Ct. ~

Mathew E. Hudson, N0. 56 West Washing-
ton place, New York.

Owen Campbell, No. 11 Washington avenue,

Albany.

Solon P. Putnam, No. '7 Greene avenue,
Brooklyn.

Patrick Murphy, Fulton street, Long Is-
land City

Frank Brown, No. 311 East Eleventh street,
New York.

Henry Smith,No. 21 East Twenty-Seventh
street, New York.

John S. Mason, Homer, New York.

Sergeant Roulette who was on duty at
Hunteris Point heard of the contemplated
mid soon after Ofﬁcer Weddell was withdrawn
from his post. The Serg cant at once collected
all the men 'on patrol at the Point and hurried
to the scene. There was no resistance made
however, to the ofﬁcers and the men were
ordered hack to their posts. Sergeant Darcy
held several men in readiness at the Astoria.
Station House, in order to be prepared for
any emergencies that might arise.

It was twenty minutes'past one when the
ofﬁcers and their prisoners arrived at the
i Station House, but some of the friends of the
latter went to Justice Delebunty who has been
2~ lying at his residence for several days past
. suffering from a. severe attack of sickness and

court and release the, prisoners on bail until
" 155.11 returned to their homes.

I About 400 sporting men from all parts of the
1 country assembled at the hotel of “Mike” Kear-
ney, on Jackson avenue. Long Island City, last
. night, to be present at the greatest cooking
3 main that ever took place on Long Island. The
main was between Troy and Long Island fowls,
,and was 235100 the battle with $1,000 on the odd
'1 battle. Thirteen battles were to have been
* fought at two o’clock this morning, when. Su-
. periutendent Haukensen of Bergh’s Society with
- six of his men raided the hotel, and there was
a stampede. The pit was on the second
ﬂoor, but that did not deter the sports
‘from jumping through the windows to the
ground. The corpulent form of an err—Mayor of
.- a neighboring oily fell ;heavily to the ground,
and had to be picked up, {and was placed in a
coach and driven quickly away in the direction
‘ oiNewtown. The otlieers succeeded in arrest-
ing John Walsh, of Bridgeport, Conu.. Nathan
Hudson, of West Washington Placal‘lew York,

seventh street, and J ames S. Mason, of Homer,
()ouriland County, New York. They also
captured three game cocks, weighing scales,
.gatl'sfand all the paraphernena of a. inst-class
.- main. They also got the pit with the Sides orit
covered with blood. The ofﬁcers took their pru—
‘ oners to the Astoria Police Station, where Judge
-Delehanty was conveniently on hand, and ad—
mitted them to bail in the sum of $209 each,
rhicourt interpreter Deistel going security for

Violation.

In the rear of 133 Concord street is an old
stable, which last night was the theater of one of the

most brutal exhibitions of cruelty on record. The K]

building stands well back from the street and is almost

hidden from View. Soon after midnight a. ge 11tle1nan~

who did not give his name went into the First Pre-
cinct Station House and informed Sergeant Lawson
that he believed a dog light was going on in the stable
mentioned. He said he had heard dogs barking and
snarling and the cries of men cheering them on. In

company with Ofﬁcers Mara, Chichester, McKenzie, .

O’Halloran and Howard the Sergeant immediately pro-
ceeded to the stable and surrounded it. The ﬁght then
seemed to be in full progress, trom the scunds 'which
were heard, and the voices of t 19 brutes who were wit-
messing the “nob'e sport” could be plainly heard as
they swore at or encouraged their respective favorites.

1 The appearance of the ofﬁcers, when they burst open ‘
lthe door, was the sign-.11 for an attempted escape on 3

the part 01' those inside. Sergeant Lawson says he is
almost positive he saw eight men when he ﬁrst entered
but only six was captured, and it is thought that the

other two got out of a. rear window. Three of them _

i ran up the ladder into the loft above and hid them-

selves in and under an old buggy which was in the ,

building. They were soon discovered and arrested.

' The two'powerful bulldogs still continued to ﬁght
and it. was With great diﬁiculty they were parted. The
sergeant told one of the prisoners, Pendleton, to sep-
arate them. He replied: If you want them separated
do it yourself 7’

When they were ﬁnally driven into different 001 here
it was discovered that the em iller of the two animals
had a heavy leather muzzle strapped on his head,

5A Combat in 3. Warren Street
Cellar. ‘

The Men and Brutes Taken into Custody.
A Struggle which was Over Before the
Police Knew Anything About it.

About half-past one o’clock this morning,
as Patrolman Higgins, 01’ the Third Precinct, was pass-
mg the tenement house 394 Warren street, he saw a.
man coming out of the basement who carried in his
arms a large white bulldog, which was bleeding from

 

 

the head and legs. The ofﬁcer, rightly susposing that
a dog ﬁght had been going on, arrested the man and
waited at the head of the steps to see if any one else
came out. Shortly after another man, also carrying a
dog in a similar condition, made his appearance. As

 

 

 

‘ ing foralong time in Maxwell’s soda water factory.

 

 

. very angry when they learned to what use the cellar
l had been put.

soon as he saw the ofﬁcer he rushed by him and made
his escape, but was arrested half an hour after-
ward by Roundsman Gray, at his home, 391 Warren
street. At the station house he gave his name
as James Larkin. His dog was found secreted in
an outhouse. The other prisoner said his name
was Edward Dowdell, and that he lived at 226 Bond
street. He is well known to the police as atongh
character and never does any work. Larkiu was gen-
erally supposed to be industrious, and has been work-

He acknowledged the ownership of the dog found
at his house, but Dowdell said the one found
with him belonged to a friend. Both ani-
mels were locked up in cells in the station
house and were seen by a reporter this morning. Dow-
dell’s dog, which is the larger of the two and which '
weighs forty pounds, had evidently had the worst of
it. Its ears, face and legs were much torn, and Ofﬁcer
Higgins said that thebrute was so used up when found
that he was unable to walk. The other dog only
weighs twenty-seven pounds, but looked wiry and bore
no serious marks of punishment. The prisoners were
taken before Judge Massey this morning and pleaded
not guilty. They were granted an adjournment until
the 16th inst., in order to enable them to procure couu-
sel. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, through Counselor George Gru, is prosecut-
ing the case. The people living in the tenement house,
who did not hear of the aﬁ‘air till this morning, were

' About, half-past 10 1 rdayuinerning an em-
1leer was walking up methorn street, near
Hoyt, when he saw a ,snang’e-‘Ioeliine beast, fully
eight feet high, babbling down the centre of the
street, led by an old man. '

On a nearer approach he discovered that the
animal was a small African elephant, covered
withaﬂaringred blanket bearing the legend,
“ Show Inside.”

The beast turned out to be the “Baby Ele-
phant.” which amused the ladies and children
throughout, the Summer in front of one of the
numerous side-shows at Coney Island.

The peerjcreature has been very lame for some

. time in its right forefoot, but in order to save the
few dollars they would have to pay for transporta-
tion its owners decided to let the animal walk all
the way from Coney Island to the pier of the
Fall River boat in New York. where it was to be
shipped to Boston. . A

" When I discovered the animal,” said Ofﬁcer

1 Glover, “it was fairly trembling With pain, and

" hobbling along at a snail’s pace, dragging its

‘ lame foot over the ground, being unable to even

. lift the limb a. few inches from the rough cobble-
, stones.” 1

1 It had taken several hours to urge the poor

'3 beast along from Coney Island to Brooklyn, and

the fellow who was leading the animal was
armed with a thickraw—hide‘ which he wisely re-
frained from using after he got inside the city
limits. ‘

“ They have ruined a valuable animalpfor the

sake of saving a few dollars," said Manager

Holmes, of the Standard Museum. “‘That was

An Episode on Fulton Street.

As Mr. Henry Bergh, President of the So-

oompanied by’his Secretary, was wending his way
through Fulton street today, about 1 0’ eloe ,
waiter having attended the funeralQ of the late Mr,
Claiiin, his attention was attracted to a team of
horses attempting to drag a load of iron castings
a trilie too heavy for their united strength. up the
Fulton street hill. Mr. Bergh, with his customary
phiianthrophy, immediately ordered the driver to
at p and transfer a portion of his load to another
tr ck. The driver, with the fear of the law in his
mind, as exemplified by Mr. Bergh, did as he was
directed at once, and lvir. Bergh, his Secretary,the
driver and. the two trucks passed peacefully on
their respective ways. The castings and the first
truck are the property of the J. L. Mott Iron
Works, of this city.

SATURDAY, JULY 31, 1886.

‘ THE POLICE WERE 0N DUTY.

And They Arrested P. J. Keaghen on Two
Charges.

5 Several trucks belonging to Patrick Kroner, of
Jersey City, .were engaged yesterday in carting
lard from Canton street, this city, to Jersey City.
P. J. Keaghen was driving one of the trucks
down Myrtle avenue when Ofﬁcer Burk. of the
First Precinct Police, noticed that he was drunk.
Ofﬁcer A. F. Glover, of the Society for the Preven-'
tion of Cruelty to Animals, at the same time saw that
the horses he was driving were in a sad condition,
and the two ofﬁcers ran from different directions to
arrest the driver, who was taken to the station-

house and charged by Oﬂ‘icrr Burk with intoxicap
tion and by Ofﬁcer Glover with cruelty to animals.
The two charges were recorded and the driver was
locked up.

Ofﬁcer Glover then went to look after the
horses. He found that of the three horses which
were drawing the load but one of them was ﬁt to
be in harness. The leader had two running sores
under the collar and one or the others was very
poor and unlit for work. The third and been. of the
three was, according to Ofﬁcer Glover’s opinion.
only ﬁt to draw an empty wagon. When detected

. One little room on Fulton street, opposite Boerum
l place, contains oilicially all the mortal and im-
mortal attributes of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals in this city. Here the four
ofﬁcers who constitute the working force of the
. establishment make their reports and bring the
trophies of their detective skill. Of these the num-
her is legion. Over ten years of active service
greets the visitor from the four walls in all manner
of startling guises.
‘ ‘ Glance around,” said Superintendent Pye to a.

i can see some of the many contrivances that man in-
vents to inﬂict torture on poor animals. 7’ The room
certainly presented a variegated appearance. There
seemed not an inch of space which was not appro-
priated for the conspicuous illustration of some
form of cruelty, and on each. mechanical contriv-

; anoe a little paper told the wretched story of its

" use. Common sticks or clubs hanging so unas—

, sumingly against the white wall had been the in-

! struments to soothe a man’s rage, and the death of

1 a beaten horse had been the result. A little piece
of fur with its legend above showed that an inno-
cent kitten had been sacriﬁced to some man’s de-
sire for ‘ ‘ fun, ” and so on through the great array,

" 1 one emblem after another revealing the outward

demonstration of all that is brutal in mankind. .

Ofﬁcer F. O. Clark,‘who has been in the servme
for over thirteen years, came into the room while
the reporter was looking at the collec—
tion, and when he had ﬁnished arranging his
1 addition to the gallery of cruelty with its inewtable
label. he turned to the reporter and said:

‘ ‘ These cases constitute the bulk of our work,
cruelty to horses. I have just arresteda man on
Court street for beating a poor, lame, Sick horse,
and if I had not interfered at the time I did, the
horse would now be dead. These are the sort of
things that crop up every day and require our con-
stant watchfulness and attention.” ,_ '

a HORSE-SQ
EM): BerghiAgrees With" the "“Union.” and,
. Offers Some SuggestiOns.
lit the Editor of the Unzon:

l - In your edition of the 17th ult. appears an arti-
tcle entitled “About H orses.” which is so sugges-
19.3.79 that 1 ask permission to offer a few remarks.
There is no part of the horse so important to
im as his feet. They are to him what the pedestal

's to the statue, the foundations to the house.
/No. matter how beautiful the superstructure may
be, nor how tenderly it lie-cared for, it" these be
neglected, or unskilfully treated, it will fall to
the ground. Every means, therefore. should be
Employed which science and experience can util—
ize to assist nature in this her great achievement.

But do we do this? n the contrary, do we

- not, as a rule, treat this most important subject
‘2 with culpable unconcern when we send our
horses to the nearest terrier, or the one, for pri~
vate reasons, most approved of by our grooms?
Even when our animals are sent to the best estab-
lishments, how many that are employed in them
are more than mere neophytes in their profes-
' sion; boys, very frequently. who, after having
' swept out the shop and straightened nails for a.
brief time, are prematurely promoted to the duty
of ﬁtting a shoe~—an art which can only be ac-
quired by careful instruction and lengthy prac-
1 lice. Well, how many of these apprentices have
[ever enjoyed such teaching? It is safe to say
I noc one out of ﬁfty. Hence, the cruel and ruin-
ous fashion of cutting: and nailing: at random
1 goes on, and millions of valuable property are
‘ destroyed.
1 Even to this day, in many. shops, that barbar-
1 one instrument, known as the “Buttress” is in
; use, by means of which the hoof is shoveled oif
; until the blood almost spouts out from the ex—
; posed pores!
, No owner of a horse should ever patronize
: shop where that remnant of ignorance and stu-
J, pidity exists. The horn of the hoof being so es-
.. sential to the animal, it should be removed most
sparingly, either by a small knife. or what is still
better,a rasp. It should be made a. felony for
any one to s(tit a red hot shoe to the foot of an
animal. _

I have thus ventured to allude to a few of the
chronic abuses of the forge, by way of introd uc~
tion to the idea I have in mind. 1

While almost all trades are represented by
guilds or societies, I know of none having: for
its object the ’im parting of correct scientiﬁc and

practical instruction in that, most essential art.
the intelligent shoeing: of the horse“ Vetermari’
science,'in a general way, treats of it. it is true:
butlhold shat it is of such profound conse-
quence torthe world at large that It should he
madeasnecml study, and to that end a Horse-
.shoeis’ Association should be incorporated by
the Legislature of every State in the Union, and
colleges endowed and supported 1001111119: to the
‘ elevation. of the art and those who practlce 1t,
and to the ultimate suppression of muohcruel-
’ ty and sacriﬁce of money. HENRY BERGE-

The Water Supply by the Pig--
A Letter from Engineer Van Buren which
Indicates that the Venerable Philan-
threpist Shot Wide of the Mark.
It is always important when pe0p1e discuss

or write about public matters. especially when they
are people who are bound to receive attention, that

 

they talk or write about. Nowtthere is that omi-
nent philanthrOpist, Mr. Henry Bergh, who wrote a
comnmnication to the State Board of iiealth (pub-
lished in the EAGLE of yesterday), in which he
said that the Brooklyn water supply from Ridge-
wood was polluted by the stagnant ponds. piggeries,

ply, 700,000 people are vitally interested and Mr.

consternation among them. But the trouble with Mr.
Bergh is that he did not know what he was writing
about. If he had visited and carefully examined
the water works at Ridgewood and the locality gen-
erally he probably would not have made the asser-
tions that he did make in his letter to the State
Health authorities. The City Works ofﬁcials, nota-
bly Chief Engineer Van Buren, who are responsible
for the condition of the water supply, are naturally
indignant at Mr. Bergh’s statements, and to-day.
Mr. Van Buren wrote that gentleman a letter, in
which he said: ,

In your statements about Brooklyn’s water supply
you have made a great mistake, and one that is un-
just to this city. The nuisances spoken of by you as
being so near the Ridgewood reservoir and pollut.
ing the water by running down the big. wells that
are dug in the ground and pumped from m the ﬂat!
is all wrong. The pumping station you refer to does
not take any water directly from the ground. The
pump well is water tight and recelves the water
from the main conduit. The nearest pumping sta-
tion that takes water out of the ground 18 2% miles
from the nuisances you complain about, and this
station only supplies 5,000,000 of gallons of the
45,000,000 of gallons used daily. The Ridgewood
reservoir is far above the drainage of the stagnant
ponds. You should correct your statements. I
fully agree with. you in regard to removing the
nuisances, and this department has frequently com-
plained about them.

Dr. Bartley, of the Brooklyn Board of Health, said
this morning: “I have been trying to stop this nuis-
ance for along time, but it seems impossible to do
anything. I have repeatedly reported the matter to
the State Board, but they have taken no steps, for
the reason that no law seems to apply to the case.
...Of course, where the refuse and garbage is allowed

to rot in the sun it can be declared a nuisance, but
action must come from the Newtown health ofﬁcers.
Last Spring, in April and May, the subject was
fully treated in the Basra, and the evil was
temporarily: abated: In the . absence of law to
meet the emergency ”we .need "public condemna-

establishments if 11,03 657 10f» the "Penal-Code:
' ‘A personhaving conﬁned an animal, ,refusesrof‘;

 

ply of goodand-wholesome air, food, shelter'and
water, is guilty of a misdemeanor.’ The animals in
these stablesare healthy and fat, so the food must
be good and wholesome. It is true that much of
the food is animal matter, but they live on it and we
are not able to prove it unhealthy. They have good
shelter and the only thing they do not have is good
air. "When you complain to the proprietors of
this they throw open the doors and have plenty
of ventilation. You cannot stay there always,
however, and keep the doors open. It is im-
possible to exaggerate the horrible stench and
the rocking ﬁlth of these stables. On a recent visit
I saw three bulls and a young heifer rotting in the
yard, and was» told by the wife of the keeper that
they had been lying there since Fall. They had
killed five hogs, which were hanging cleaned ready
for market. Mr. Hobday, meat inspector, who was
with me, condemned three of them as unﬁt for use
2 and ordered them buried. When I visited the place
i a few days later one was still hanging there. The
other four were-gone. I do not know where.”

5

5 twelve hands high, whose every move and general ’g

= appearance pronounced him a thoroughbred, con— i
tentedly feasting on a heap of freshly cut grass just
outside the new Hall of Records, on Boerum place,
yesterday, attracted general attention. Every bone

* in the poor beast’s body stuck out prominently and
on its back was a huge running sore, Wile its right

f fore leg was almost useless, so lame was it. Be-

‘ spite these palpable defects nobody passed without l

, takinga second look at the animal. Several ladies ‘

, stopped to pat the emaciated bouy and a crowd of

a men and boys gathered around and speculated on

the possible records made by the animal in its

palmy days.

The horse had seen about a score of years and
was discovered yesterday morning by (Juicer
Glover, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, at Willoughby and Adams streets wea-
rily trudging along drawing a heavy load of furni- ~
ture on the top of Which was seated a man and a. ‘
boy. As it reached the corner the poor animal
stopped involuntarily and swayed from side to side.
The driver was about to urge it on, when his com-

; panion espied Ofﬁcer Glover approaching and,
shouting a warning to the driver, slipped from the
wagon and disappeared up Willoughby street. The :

a holder of the reins seemed inclined to imitate his ;
example, but the ofﬁcer was too quick and imme-

‘ diately placed him under arrest. When the horse »

_was taken from the truck and made comfortable

ithe driver was arraigned before Justice Walsh -'

lto whom he said that his name was George H. 1,

lumith, and that he was a dealer in second-hand .

s furniture at No. 481 Columbia street. He was ﬁned .

i $5 and left for home at once. Later in the day he l
visited the society’s ofﬁce on Fulton street and ;

; asked What disposition was to be made or the am- ;

‘ mal. He was inlormed that it had been condemned

- and would be killed to~day. He then oftered to care

for the horse during the last night oi its exustence l

and was allowed to take it away. lie was a little 2

inclined to be surly, and when questioned concern— ,1

ing the animal’s pedigree claimed to be in Ignorance; ,

of it, and said he purchased the beast from a. horse-l

dealer and never tooK the trouble to make inquiry;
concerning it. When about to lead the animag

of the crowd became more intense, and only the j
presence of Ohicer Glover saved him tram a drab-g j

“ How is the dog crop? ” Pound Keeper [
Stratton was asked.

‘It was never better than it is now. The annexa- 1
tion of New Lots has increased the receipts wonder: J
fully We commenced operations on J une 15 and f
on the Saturday following there were seventy dog:

‘I in limbo. There were none drowned the ﬁrst elm?“

but on the week ending June 26 the curs amounted ‘
to 154111 number, out of which 128 entered the iron
cage for their last ride over the waters of the East
River. 011 the Saturday following, July 8, we had
on hand 185 dogs, but before noon on that date
there were only twenty left to wag their tails at my
friendly approach. As we balance the ledger every
Saturday it is only necessary to give dates, and I will '
say that on July 10 l counted 139 dogs in the ken-
nels, and on that date sent 187 of them to a watery
grave, leaving only two dogs to welcome their fol-
lows that came in the following week; but the crop
accumulates fast, for on July 17 I patted the heads

Of 115 pets, all of whom went to their Inuf home on
that day. The reception house was then 83.....-

109 of Whom handed in their mourning cards. The
receipts for the last day in that month counted up
126, but as we had some stock on hand from the
week previous 148 met their death in a peaceful
manner The ﬁrst week in August netted 116 and
the second week 145, out of which 92 and 128 dogs
followed their brothers to the bottom of the river.
Up to date this week our men have only corraled
7‘4 and as 70 of this number have been drowned
there are only 4 left to greet their kin upon a new
arrival. Thus you will see that since the grand
opening there have been 1, 267 dogs received in th:

NINE HGRSES KILLED.

Efforts to Stamp ﬂint the {Handlers
Coney Island.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals received a communicat on a few days ago in ‘
which it was stated that there were several her: ‘ '
in Hamilton’s stables at Coney Island, suitor).
from a contagious malady. An agent of the seeiet
visited the stables yesterday afternoon and mad
an examination of the 200 horses which were in th
stalls. When it vas completed he ordered nine ‘
the animals, which. he said were suffering in:
glanders, taken out, and in half an hour he kill:
them. Mr. Hamilton was net aware of the exist
ance of the disease among the horses and had it not“
been for the society it is more than probable that
his loss would have been much larger.

1,6’rii-ge with you,” replied the reporter.

Thev‘do‘gcatcher turned up his nose and
'with an oath’Walked off. The UNION re.
porter then sought the ﬁnely dressed man
who had made the indignant remarks.

“It IS a shame,” said be, “what liberty
these brutes have. They don’t care for any
dogs except pets. Look there," added the
speaker ; “they don’t want that our that 1s
running about there not only unmuzzled
but unlicensed on the green in front of. the
City Hall, but they wanted that little
black-and-tan only because it IS a pet. I m
glad they didn't get it, for if they had
its owner would never have seen it again.
Those dogs don’t go to the pound,where the

catchers only get 50 cents apiece for them.
They are taken and sold out of the city at
a price seldom less than $5 apiece. Only a
few Sundays ago I noticed them stealing a
pet dog on Atlantic avenue, They had
everything complete to put their scheme
into successful operation. They had a nice
little dog, which had probably been Stolen,-
attached to a long string, and they
let it run into the areaways or hallways at
the houses and stores, and naturally if
there were any dogs within sight the decoy
dog would have its effect in bringing the
pets within capturing distance. This par-
ticular instance I refer to made me very
indignant. The decoy dog ran into a hall-2
way and almost instantly a pretty little
pet ran out with the usual result. The dog-
catcher grabbed it by one of its hind
legs and carried it off and pitched
it into his cart, where it howled
until its voice was drowned in the
distance. The dog’s mistress ran out after
it; several little children whose pet the dog"
really was also ran out crying and begging

for the dog,but it was of no avail. The - ,

dogcatcher knew the breed of the dog,
and knew where he could ﬁnd a market for
it. That is only one ofthe numberless 1n-
stances where the dogcatchers have proved
by their acts that they are only com-
mon thieves whom the police should deal
with vigilantly.” .
Shortly after noon to-day a complaint
was lodged against Dogcatcher No. lei-at
the oﬂice oi the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals. It is understood

reckon the terror and the other four will be intro-
duced to me before next execution day.”

Looking over a list of letters received by Mr. Strat-
ton, the following cullings were taken from them:
P. H. Butler, of Hoyt and Wyckol‘l streets, inquires
for “a bull dog with a screw tail. 7’ Frank Graham,
of 356 Ninth street, South Brooklyn, writes in im-
ploring terms about. a “small Italian greyhound,
fawn and white, who answers to the name of
Prince.’ Howard Smith, of 214 Keap street, says
that his black and tan, no white, answering when
called I. 0., was stolen from his promises. I. F.
Dudley, cf 32 South Oxford street. has lost his
Scotch terrier, shaved up to the front shoulder.
George Englehard, of 268 Stagg street, says that his
pug, bearing license tag 2,438, is missing, and Mrs.
S. G. Adams, 7'19 Quincy street, bemoans her loss in
a. Skye terrier named Major, who carries tag 1,219.
On the back of a piece of music entitled “Golden
Chords Waltz” is written a full description of a
Newfoundland belonging to W. Barker, of 317 Lori- 1
mer street. There are many other notes of like 1
nature, but the good natured pound master says
that his greatest trouble is with the fair sex: “They

pets, and many a time I have seen women cry for joy
when they laid eyes on their dogs. If there is any»
thing in the world that makes me feel sad it is to
see a woman grieve, and in that case I do all in my
power to restore to them their lost favorite,” said
the old man, as be brushed away a drop of crystal.
By this time a load of dogs came in. under the

Thomas McEvoy. The latter had been arrested for
taking a dog out of a woman’s bedroom, at 331
Leonard street. He said to the reporter: " We had
the purp in the gutter before he reached the wom-
an’s door, and, though we were arrested, she was
afraid to come up to Naeher’s Court and appear

 

 

against us; so I was discharged after spending one

night in Raymond street. The our was an ugly
black Spitz, and she offered to buy it back from us
for $2. but we were too honest to accept bribes, and
yet they say that dogcatchers are bad men. ”

‘ Joseph Finch said: “ That reminds me of the

the charge being assault in the ﬁrst degree.
He claimed the woman was his wife and
that she had fallen in the water and he
was trying to get her out when the ofﬁcers
and others appeared.

Her story is that she knew the man and ’

that he came to the Island and found her

some words and left the saloon. ‘

did not pay any attention to where they

were going. Suddenly he struck her down ‘
and she remembered no more until she ‘

Both parties were very much intoxicated
when they left Flynn’s and that was the
circumstance which led to Drummond and

threatened with death by Kearns when he
was in ajealous mood. -

There was a large attendance of the female neigh-
bors of Michael Vellek at the Twelfth street police
court this morning when the case against him for
inhuman cruelty to his 10 year old boy, Charles,
was taken up. Annie Egermeyer, one of the neigh-
bors, said she saw the boy tied to the post and look-

Vellek said that the boy had run away the night
before with a peddler, and that he had found him
that morning in an alley off Eighteenth street. He
took him home and put him in a room, but the boy
threatened to break out; sohe tied him to the wood-
shed till he could consult a lawyer about sending
the boy to an institution. lie intended to be back
abOut noon.

Justice White read the statute against cruelty,
and said: “This offense is something more than
disorderly conduct. A punishment severe enough
to throw a tender child into convulsions must be of
a. nature to injure his health. It would be heroic

treatment to tie a child fast to a bed post, intending
‘ to leave him there for four hours, but to string him

up in an out-house where there are rats is enough to

: drive him into hysterics. That is ﬁendish cruelty.
l I’ll bind Vellek to the grand jury in $700. Furnish

Bail was procured and Vellek released. He was
followed to his home by a. crowd of women who
hooted and groanad after him.

but I 5168 almost every day of my life such terrible
abuses, and seemingly no intervention for the pro-
,tection of horses, I have felt that if the society has
had a being it must have gone into dissolution or
else has little efﬁciency. I should suppose that if
there were such an association that there would be
ofﬁcers employed by it to discover whether abuses
do exist and to exercise such a surveillance as to
prevent what I am sure is so comma 11. As an illus—l

fore being put in their cellar stal 1e... Ev very one of
these horses had sores on their backs or shoulders
that should have prevented them from being
worked until the sores had been healed. ()11 the
neck and on the off shoulder of one of these poor
creatures was a sore nearly as large as the palm of
my hand thatwas as raw as a piovc of unronkod
beef. l\ot only had the hide or s {in boon ont'troly
charred away, but the flesh had been, so to speak,
bowled out. Doubtloss these injuries occurred from
portions of the harness, from bad collars, saddles
improperly padded or stuffed, or buckles un-
covered where they came in contact with the horse.
With such unsuitable hI rness, hitched to 1111- i
merciful loads, such injuries 1n ist produce intense .
sufferings. Almost exery Ilay fez weeks I have

a. horse suffering from glanders to be worked. ‘Mr.
George Gru appeared for the society and Dr. “Tab-

on Friday last, Supt. Clark has discovered that the
pound is being conducted in a. manner greatly det-

oilicers claim, the dogs are treated in a most in-
human and cruel manner. Tuesday the ﬁrst batch
of dogs was drowned. It is a rule of the depart-
ment to watch the pound closely, and shortly after
the drowning Supt. Clark and Ofﬁcer Glover
reached the hi sce. While they were standing there
the pound wagon, avenicle with a. box upon it ﬁve

CRUEL TREATMENT OF A VALUABLB
YOUNG RACER.

 

Stableman Rowe on Trial for Beating the
Horse-Coney Islandﬂorsemen Interested.
Justice Waring Gives the Prisoner Sixty
Days in the Penitentiary.

Justice lVaring‘s Court at Police Headquarters,

 

 

 

Coney Island, was crowded to its utmost this morn-
ing by owners of blooded horses, jockeys, and lovers
of the turf. Interest was centered in George Rowe.
a tall, rawboned, powerfully built man, who was
under arrest for having beaten and probably ruined
the race horse Racquet, on Sunday evening last.
Racquet was regarded as one of the most promising
young stallions on the Brighton Beach Course, and
his value went up steadily from the time he was put
upon the track until Saturday. when he carried away
the prize in one of the races. He was taken to the
stable of W. J. Bryan,"fiis owner, and placed in the
care of Rowe. On Sunday evening Rowe went to
the stall and led Racquet out. According to his
statement to the Court this morning the horse seized
him and tore his coat, and in self—defense he struck
it with a stick he carried. The witnesss was not
very certain that Racquet was vicious, although he
had said that both Mr. Bryan and his foreman had
told him so.

The prosecution brought forward a host of wit-
nesses, including Trainer Hammill, Mr. Bryan, Ofﬁ—
cer Glover, of the S. P. C. A., who made the arrest,
and others. Mr. Hammill saw Rowe leading Rac-
quet out, and saw him savagely grab the animal by
the nose, saw him beat him over the face and fore-

 

head, and about the legs, and chase him
all around the lot. This was corroborated.
The witnesses all declared that the horse

was gentle, and then Ofﬁcer Glover described the
injuries inﬂicted. Racquet’s knuckles were both
knocked out of position, his left eye was closed, and
a number of bleeding cuts were found on his face.
Across his forehead was a hard ridge as large as a
finger, raised by a blow, and from Sunday night
until Tuesday morning the brute bled continually. It
is believed that some arteries in the head are rup—
tured, and probably the skull is fractured. ~Whether
Racquet will ever run again is very doubtful.

After listening to the evidence, Justice Waring de-
livered ascathing lecture to the prisoner, denouncing
his conduct and warning all the jockeys and horse-
men present that cruelty to the noblest creation of
God next to man would meet with the severest pun-
ishment. He then imposed a sentence of sixty days
in the penitentiary, without a ﬁne, and declared that
no inﬂuence could get the prisoner out. Racquet
was entered for a race on Monday, and owner Bryan
forfeited $250 by his not appearing. Today he said
he did not know that the animal was worth $9, al-
though he had been offered $1,900 for him on Sunday
morning.

HARD ON THE HORSES.

SHAKING UP THE CITY RAILROAD
COMPANIES.

 

 

Activity of Ofﬁcer Glover of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
Sanding the Tracks.

The various street car companies of the city have
within the past two days received a vigorous shaking
up in the matter of overworking their horses. Com-
plaints have been received for some time by the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,
and on Saturday Ofﬁcer Glover stationed himself at
the junction of Sands and Fulton streets and watched
the incoming and outgoing cars. During the two
hours he was waiting no less than three horses
were thrown to the ground on the curve,
and in each case it was only by acci-
dent that the animal was not permanently disabled.
The curve was rounded at a gallop, and the slippery
stones caused the brutes to lose their footing and ‘
slide under the wheels. Mr. Glover notiﬁed the
drivers that they must walk, and if not they would

 

  

 

 

 

be arrested. The same day he watched the process
of pulling the Park avenue cars up the grade on
Washington street, from Water to Concord. The tow
horses were found to be inadequate to the work,
and the company was notiﬁed to put two
extra horses on every car, not only during the
busy hours, but all day. Yesterday Ofﬁcer
Glover saw that his instructions had been
complied with. Following this action on Sunday,
Superintendent Clark stationed himself on Broad-
way, at Flushing avenue, and saw that only four tow
horses were used in the heavy trafﬁc up the bill. He
stopped every car until a. horse could be obtained to
help pull it, and then gave a notice that at least

The Company Resumes Operations To-dav’, 1
But Will Probably Stop Again This Even-
ing—~A Rumor that Henry Bergh’s Ofﬁcer’s
Did It-Another that they Stopped Be-a
cause It Lost Money-Settlement with the
Employees. « ' .

The cable road cars on Park avenue stopped run-
ning at 9 o’clock last evening. A. rumor ﬂew around
immediately that the men had tied the road up.
This proved to be untrue, however, because the men
were 'just as ignorant of the cause of the tie-up as
the public. - p .

Various reasons are assigned for the stoppage. It
is said to-day by peOple along incline that Ofﬁcer
Glover, of Bergh’s society, stopped the road because
the horses were broken down pulling the heavy cars ,
during the heat of the last few days. {Not a few as« «a
serted that the animals’ breasts were sore and that it 4
was inhuman to work them.

A leading railroad man said that the stoppage was
‘ due to the fact that the road took in little money 3
after ‘9 o’clock, and that the ofﬁcials. stopped the- 1
years because of this fact and also to save their
horses. This cause may have some truth in it. A
CITIZEN reporter talked to a resident of Park avenue :
I tc-day about the stoppage. The gentleman said he ,
waited nearly an hour fora car before he learned:
that they had stopped running. ,

“I heard this morning,“ he added. “that the com- ‘
pany stopped last night because it did not pay to ‘
run, and that they would stop to-night, and perhaps
every evening during the hot weather. If that is
true, I think the people patronizing the line will take
. steps to compel the company to run its cars until a
reasonable hour. When a charter is given to a car 1,
company it is understood that the public w1ll be
accommodated. It isa speculative business on the
1 ' pdrt of the investors, and if they lose that is no rea~
son why they should stop trafﬁc. If the cable coma
pany cannot run cars at a proﬁt at night, let it give
up the charter to a company that will.”

Regarding the rumor that Ofﬁcer Glover stopped
the cars,,it is a well-known fact that he or some
officer connected with the Bergh society, stood at
the Bridge entrance, on Sands street, all morning,
and kept a close watch on the cable car horses. ‘
The railroad men around the 'locality reiterated the CI
rumor that Glover did the tying up. A CITIZEN re-
porter was unable to ﬁnd any one at the society’s
ofﬁce on Fulton street but a small boy, who was toe
busy Cleaning windows to think of such trivial mat.
ters as tie-ups.

Several members of the Executive Committee 01

ployees Knights of. Labor ‘ organization, visited

Those Mules Must Go.

The activity of the Scolety for the Prevention of
:' Cruelty to Animals, combined with the widespread
‘ publicity given to the matter in THE CITIZEN. has
resulted in decisive action by Street Contractor
Heman Clark. Although yesterday’s 1 conference at
George F. Swift’s ofﬁce was a. quiet one, yet the con:
clusion a1 rived at has been learned, and it is a
, victory for law. The contractor has determined to
reupplant the mules by horses as fast. as the latter
"can be purchased. To carry this resolution into
eifect an agent was to- day dispatched to New York

:‘1 to purchose some good animals, and contract for .
more until the number needed are secured.

TROUBLE FOB. CLARK:

 

1n: Discovrns THAT EVEN MULES
HAVE RIGHTS.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals Determined to Stamp Out the
Practice of Using Disabled Horses for
Active Work.

Street Cleaning Contractor Heman Clark is having
beans of trouble all through the determination of
Mr. Bergh‘s society to forbid the use of disabled
animals on the street. From the very beginning of
Clark‘s work of removing dirt in Brooklyn he has
been watched narrowly, and matters have become
worse until now his operations are threatened with
total stop;...ge. When the new contractor started
out on the ﬁrst day of his duties Ofﬁcer Glover, of
the Soc'ety for the PreVention of Cruelty to Animals,
Spent three hours inspecting the animals to be used in
the work. During that time no less than twenty
horses were declared unﬁt and sent to the stable.
But as Mr. Clark had only hired the brutes,and prom—
ised to get othersof his own, he was not molested.
Lately, however, the society has seen that interfer-
ence was necessary, and afew days ago Superin~
tendent Clark arrested four persons for using mules
unﬁt for work. Among those arrested was Patrick
Greeney, the foreman of the contractor‘s stables,
and to-day Officer Glover secured another war-
rant for the same man’s arrest, to be served
after the present charge against him is set-
tled. Mr. Glover started' out yesterday and
made a tour of Adams and Pearl streets, closely ex-
aming the mules that were being used. As a result
he arrested Drivers William Walsh, J. A. Candall,
and John Doody. Another driver escaped by run-
ning away. Walsh was driving one mule that had
three sores on it, .one of them being six by four
inches and bleeding continuously. The other mules
were also badly broken out. Sixteen of the animals
were taken away from the work and sent to
the stables on Schenck street, near Myrtle
avenue. Notwithstanding this large haul,
Mr. Glover started out this morning to
again inspect, and Superintent Clark will follow
up the matter also closely. As a result of these
wholesale arrests the street contractor has become
alarmed, and this morning a conference of the chiefs
of the work Was held in Mr. Swift’s ofﬁce, in the Con-
tinental Building, on Montague street. There were
present Mr. Swift, who has just returned from the
country, Contractor Clark, Superintendent Greeney
and several others, and the matter was thoroughly
discussed. What was decided upon could not be
learned, as the participants refused to tell.

In speaking of the activity of - the society Superin-
tendent Clark said: “We are going to watch them
night and day and put a stop to their using bad
mules. We have no animosity, and/[the mules speak
for themselves." Oﬂicer Gloveradded: “There are
employed by the contractioﬁahoutione hundred and
twentyﬁve mules, and not met-e» than one-fourth are
lino work. And theatre these animals haul

W J
, 'GREBNBY BECOMES A MODERN JOB-

Heman Clark’s Superintendent Will Have
to Appear in Three Courts.

Patrick Greeney, the superintendent of Contractor
lieman Clark’s stables on Schenck street, is becom-
; mg a modern Job in the estimation of himself and
‘ friends. Mr. Greeney came from New York to work

for Mr. Clark on the 23d day of July last. and he to-
day declared that he had seen more judges and
courts since then than in his whole previous life. He
was arrested by Superintendent Clark, of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, shortly after
he came to Brooklyn. This case was adjourned, but as
the mules used by the contractor to do his work con~
tinned to have sores and be dillapidated looking. Mr,
Greeney was again arrested. This did not seem to
cure matters, and Superintendent Clark, of the soci.
ety, found a disabled animal being driven by Richard
Jackson. For the third time Greency was arrested, on
a warrant issued by Justice Naeher this morning. As
with the other cases. an adjournment was given, and
now the poor man will be in court as follows: On
the 17th of August beiore Justice Kenna, on the 19th
before Justice Naeher, and on the 23d before Justice
Walsh. The charge in each case is cruelty to ani~

A DISEASED COW,

Whose Milk Was sold Every Day for
Three Months.

‘ Herman Raller, of 838 Flushing avenue,
was arrested yesterday morning by‘Superintendent
Clarke, of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals,» for selling a cow which Wassutfering
from contagious pleuro pneumonia to Jacob Stratus,
of 16 Morse Street.

“I received word from the police that a cow with
a broken leg was lying in front of Raller’s resi-
dence,” said Mr. Clarke to an EAGLE reporter, “and
I hastened there to dispatch the animal, but was
not long in ﬁnding out that the poor animal was
not suffering as reported. Raller said that he did
not own the animal but that Straus did, and each, un~
known to the other, signed a paper stating that the
property was not his. I killed the cow, and the
carcass was sent to the offal deck. The dis-
ease is of three months? standing and that cow has
been giving milk all the time. Raller sells thirty "
quarts of milk daily at rotailand forty quarts a day
at wholesale. Without a. doubt some poor children
have been taking that milk as nourishment, but you
can rely upon it that the party guilty of selling such
3 poison will be punished. If we were to allow this
i, kind of thing to go on there would be very few

babies living at the end of the year.”

Employees of the Street-Sweeping Contractor
Arrested by Oﬂicers of Mr. Bergh.\ i

Supt. Clark. of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals. with Omcer Glover. ;
made a descent yesterday on mules used by Herman
Clark, the street—sweeping contractor. The ani-
mals were at work on streets in various parts of the
city, and were harnessed to sweepers and carts. .
Some thirty teams were examined. .

In one locality they found four teams in a. con—
dition unﬁt for work, all of the mules having sores
under their collars. The ofﬁcers of the society
ordered them to be taken out of the carts and
sweepers at once and, sent back to the stables.

One of the mules was in a spedialiy bad condi-
tion. It had a raw sore. at least four inches in

diameter, on the right breast, half of the sore
being under the collar and the other half outside.
That the exposed portion 01‘ the sore might not be a
seen by the people passing on the street, it was in-
geniously covered by a niece of canvas attached
to the collar. This mule was in a sweeper and was
suffering terribly When the ottlccrs stopped it- The
driver, Thomas Burns, was arrested by Supt. ,
Clark and charged with cruelty. 1n explanation,

 

Burns told the oﬂlcers he was ordered to
drive the mule by Patrick Greehey, the contrac- ,
tor’s superintendent. Burns was taken to Justice
Kenna’s‘court for arraignment, and while there
Greehey appeared and Went up to Burns and said
something to him in an under tone. Supt.
Clark then arrested Greehey.

Burns was charged with driving a mule unﬂt .
for work, and Greehey was charged with causing,
Burns to drive it. Both men pleaded guilty and
were lined and the lines were at once paid. Eight
charges have been made against Greehey by the
society since Aug. 6. He is a New Yorker and
W115 brought over to this city by the contractor to .
take charge of his stables. ‘

Supt. Clark says that the carts used for car-
rying off the sweepings were built for three
mules, but that only two of these animals, and
small ones at that, are put to a cart. ‘

voluntary act On his part and to ask damages
for the performance of a? voluntary act of this
character would be preposterous.

The truth of the matter is that the sprink-
ling of the tracks with sand is not only advis-

able but necessary. It diminishes the risk of
to grip the wheels; it is a protection to the
feet of horses in the trying seasons of the
year; and it tends also to maintain an even

. . tuned to death. Nature has given the "
hérsé‘as well as certain other brute creatures
an Organ of vision that magniﬁes objects so
that he does not appreciate and take injurious

‘- advantage of his relative size and strength.
Fire, therefore, exerts a superlatively ter-

} rifying effect on the horse, and he

, becomes uncontrollable in its presence.
The conservative policy of all horse car compa-
nies shows itself in many ways, but invariably
in the construction of stables with a single

. passage for exit, and this policy uniformly
aids in making disastrous an event such as
that of last night. The company in question

1 suifers a heavy loss, but as a business enter-

]; prise its proﬁt; in the past will warrant the

5 speedy rebuilding of the stables and the pur~
chase of new horses. The health of these
animals succumbs in a few years to the tread-
mill labor of dragging ponderous vehicles
up long grades, while their boots beat a con-
stant metallic tattoo upon stone pavements.
Car horses are sometimes mercifully killed by
the agents of Henry Bergh’s Society, but as a
rule they perish one by one by fatal accident

or from diseases of the hoofs and limbs that

rough and unremitting work entails. Tender
hearted persons may take comfort in the re-

1 ﬂeetion that the horse as a power in city loco.-
motion is being rapidly supplanted by steam
and that Brooklyn before the close of this

, century will be freed of the unsatisfactory

i .
l methods of travel now 1n vogue.

to be a man of violent temper, struck a $600 pacing
horse in the eye with abale stick last night and
knocked the eye completely out of. the socket. He
pads that Sprague has ill treated a number of

 

“horses in his stables of late and that several of

them are now lame. The other stablemen. he says,

Mr. Clark then arrested Mulvaney and tookhim

ten days. As the railroad people were the rimary
cause of the trouble, the Society for the reven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals will probably proceed _
against them. It is believed that the horse wasin-

followed. ' , .
Another case of cruelty to a horse was brought
to the society by Veterinary Surgeon Max Hartvrg-

The Eminent Philanthropist’s Career-«The
Son of an American Shipbuilder-ﬂis-
tery (lithe S. P. C. A.

Henry Bergh. the president and founder of
the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Anio
male, died at his home, 429 Fifth avenue, New York,
yesterday morning. He had suite: ed several years
from chronic dyspepsia. Mr. Bergh was born in
New York in 1823. His father was Christian Bergh,
a. men of German ancestry, and one of the most
prominent American shipbuilders or his era. Chris-
tian was a native of the Empire State and dwelt for
many years in New York City, and here, at the age
of 83, he died, leaving to his three children
the comfortable fortune which he had accumu-
lated. During the later years of his life his sons
Henry and Edwin became partners in his business.
A large piece of land bordering on the East River
in that portion of the city which is now known as
the Seventh Ward was formerly his property, and
there in 1810, at the foot of Gouverneur street, he
started his shipyard. Among the famous vessels
built under his direction was the President—the
American frigate which in the War of 1812 sur-

7 passed all previous records for great Speed, beside

GOiBg Splendid work as a men of war. After win-
ning a. number of engagements the President was
ﬁnally outmntched and captured by the English,
who took her over to the other side and for many
years used her and model from which to build their
line of battle ships. In 1842 Henry and Edwin
Bergh dissolved partnership, and their shipyard
was broken up. His family being possessed of
means, Henry Bergh got an excellent; education.
which he completed at Columbia College. Before

. reaching the end of his course he made a. visit to

Europe, remaining there about ﬁve years. Before
departing he married Miss Taylor, daughter of a,
Wealthy Englishman residing in New York. While
in Europe,in 1862, he was appointed Secretary of
Legation at St. Petersburg and acting Vice Consul.
Being possessed ot a delicate constitution, he was
obliged, by reason of the great severity of the cli-
mate. to resign this ofﬁce in 1864, after which he

~ made a tour of Europe and traveled extensively in

the East. He became interested in the subject of
prevention of cruelty to animals while living in St.
Petersburg and, later on, this interest was greatly
increased through an acquaintance with the Earl of
Herrowby, president or the Royal Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in London. When

‘ Mr. Bergh founded his society he modeled it al-

most entirely after the English one. On his return
to New York be determined to devote the remain.

Henry Berg. h’s Character.

Henry Bergh died on a day when the dumb
creation most needed his rcinistrotions. The .‘
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Anité“

male, thatis so cloecl“ associated with his
name, has been too ﬁrmly eetd‘oli: hed to fall to
pieces because of the death of its founder._

Its aims are no longer subject to the ridicule
and open hostility of the public at large, and
Eldridge ’1‘. Gerry, vice president of the 1
society, will probably assume control of its
elicit-e and bring them into nearer rela‘
tious with the kindled Society for tile.

- Fulton Ss‘trcct. ' t

~

“”yeéterduy afternoon on Fulton street right above
ljg-ilztochESter avenue. Frank 0. Clark. the superin-
.;7?to'lldent for Long Island of the Society for the Pre—
a‘ﬁntlon of Cruelty to Animals, was phasing there at
gﬁboutti o'clock when he heard an awful equalling
1:'9§vei'hea<i. A peculiar eight met the superintend-
;:;_gnt’e upward gaze. Clinging to the telephone wires
gfgfvithin ﬂve feetei‘the pole was a. large gray and
black cat that was moaning at a. terrible rate.
_ Clark’s love [or his profession caused him to devise
nomemeans for the animal’s rescue. One of the
linemen for the telephone company was sent for
1; and he was soon at the top of the pole. Reachiug
‘Qut be grasped the cut and, holding her at arm’s
I length, cried out: “Lookout below.”
. “if you dropthat cat I’ll arrest you,” yelled back
1::Clal'k. -
“What shall I do?” asked the lineman.
“Put her on your back,” suggested the superin-
- tendent.
The lineman did so and started down. Every-
l“i"'-:th5'ug went well until he get within six feet of the
ground. Then the cat, in turning about so as to be
1ffreadytojump, scratched the lineman’s neck until
Theyelled with pain. lie made a vicious backward
blow at the animal but Thomas made 3. Jump,
‘- struck the ground and was of! like a. shot. How the
_'eat'got on the wires is a, mystery. Perhaps he was
“‘ét‘hro‘wn from one of the windows of the three story
tibii‘ildings in that neighborhood but the superin-
tendent believes that Thomas climbed the pole in
. chaseuof‘ sparrows. Nevertheless the cat got away
tsunhurt while the linemen walks around with a.
"scratched neck.

Their stamping-ground is so located that their
presence can only be learnfd from one point of
observation, and. as they eep a sharp lookout,
theycan enerally see a person coming towards

them in t me to make good their escape. We gave
~ them a, good chase a short time ago, and pressed
them so hard that they had to leave some or their
traps behind them, which we captured. We are
‘ preparing for a more enectual descent now, and
we will not let up on them until we break up the
- business.- The penalty for trapping birds ranges
all the way from a. line or $1 to $500 and
from imprisonment from one day to a year. Both
a ﬁne and imprisonment could be imposed, so that
the maximum enalty is imprisonment for a. year
and 31 line of $50 . Game Constable’Wsrdell, whose
special duty it is to look after such matters, has
arrested bird trappers from time to time, but we
are also determined to do our best to enforce the

, that attract the prey in great numbers. Prospect
Park is directly opposite, and the birds of various
feathers from that pleasure ground ﬂock together
on the slope book of the reservoir in search or
food, which is liberally supplied for them there by
nature and artiﬁce. .

The trappers place their snares here, and in the
spring, early summer and fall reap a good harvest.
Their means of capture are both simple and hires-
tive. The favorite device is to place in the feeding
grounds upright supports, punctured here. and
there sufﬁciently to barely hold small sticks,
thinner than an ordinary skewer. These sticks

charge of its peculiarly arduous duties. and quite a
number of interesting stories are on record in the
society’s oﬂices at No. 414 Fulton street. .

Yesterday the society, having sustained the
charge, James Clanc'oy, of Russell, a driver for
the Grand street and Newtown surface railroad,
was .found guilty by JudgeNaeherot having
treated most cruelly one of the horses. driven by
him on June it at the corner of Humboldt and
Grand streets. Clancey had his choice between
paying a ﬁfty-dollar ﬁne and going to jail to: the
same number of days. He chose the latter. The
arrest of the brutal driver and the particulars of
his oﬂense are as tollows: On June 8 Supt. Clark
received notiﬁcation from the Grand Street and
Newtown Railroad Company that a driver in their
employ had, in a ﬁt of passion, knocked the eye
out of one of their horses, and that they were de-
sirous of having the society take the matter in
hand.” Special Officer of the Society Denyse
promptly investigated the case and found that
Clanccy had in the most uncalled-for manner
jumped from his car as it neared Grand.
and Humboldt streets, and simply because

one'ot the poor, panting animals he drove had
slipped his foot over the trace, took the submissive
creature by the bridle and dealt 1t such-a blow over
the head with the butt of the whip that its eye was
completely knocked from the socket. Clancey was
promptly jailed on June 12, and his trial called
soon after, but as long as he could he put it 01?,
claiming that he was not ready, until yesterday.
omcer Denyse also arrested Philip Fraz, of No.
356 Johnson avenue, at 6.30 o’clock yesterday
morning, ' for driving before a heavy wagon loaded
With ten liVe hogs an emaciated and otherwise
crippled horse. Judge Naeher ﬁned Fraz $5, ,
Which the latter paid. While the reporter Who
collected the foregoing items was talking to the
Superintendent in his unique quarters, which are
decorated profuselr with equine and otherskulls
and bones from departed members or the animal
kingdom, several complaints set-tin forth alleged
ill-treatment of animalﬁ were. me you from say.

'..1‘hc Monthly Report of Superintendent

Clark’s Society. "

In the usual monthly report of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to .cimals Superinn‘
tondeut F. L. Clark, of Brooklyn, states that in this
city during the month of June the oilicers of the so- ,
I ciety made eighteen arrests, destroyed ninety i

horses and thirty-ﬁve small animals. 3
fl‘hcy also had sixty-live horses suffering from ‘
7»lan‘lencss, heat, etc, sent to their owners’ stables to
. recuperate. During the same period the ambu- :
, lance was called out thirty-three times to remove i
sick or disabled horses. Speaking of the recent I
outbreak of glanders in the Reid avenue car stables i'
Mr. Clark said that in his opinion all stables 1'
containing many cases of farcy or glanders should i
7 be strictly quarantined. N0 disease was more cer-
. tainly fatal to the human family. as well as to the l
equine race, than this dreadful disease. Several }
~~deaths, in the most dreadful form , had occurred
7from it during the past year on Long Island, and l
[a case of cure of this fatal disease had
never been known. Apparently, the disease
wasnow stamped out in the Reid avenue stables. i
the wood work had been torn out, the concrete re- ‘
moved and replaced and a thorough fumigation ;
had been given the place. Mr. Clark said the quesi:
tion had never been tested whether a railroad sta- ;
A ble could be quarantined or not, but he believed '
Lthey should be. ‘
17,7-VA strange feature of this disease, Mr. Clarke said,
Was that in a stable the next horse to a. diseased one
fivould escape innoculation and the disease would
' sippear in one four or ﬁve States away. “And yet,” l
he continued, “see the men who ﬂay and cut up 5
these animals. Their hands will be cut and
_’ scratched and like dog catchers they never take ~"

“ disease in that way, I really cannot understand l
it." , .

Ways and Means of Keeping Up the Supply .
i “of Ornithological Ornaments for Ladies’
Hats—Crusade Against the Trappers
Begun by the Society for the Prevention

of Cruelty to Animals. '

Ladies Who delight in wearing in theii head-
gear birds or ornaments involuntarily contributed
(by the feathered tribe may not know that they en-
courage law-breaking; but they do just the same.
Most of the ornithological decorations dear to'the
feminine heart are secured by trapping the pretty
little creatures whose lives are sacriﬁced to supply
novelties in the millinery line. and that is a misde-
meanor punishable by line or imprisonment, or
both.

Trapping birds has become quite a. business, and
the outskirts of Brooklyn and New York furnish
fertile ﬁelds of operation. So numerous have
these bird-catchers become that the Societies for
the Protection of Cruelty to Animals in both cities
have began a crusade against them with the deter-
mination of crushing out the tramc. The offenders
are extremely wary, however. the very nature of
their calling requiring caution and ingenuity, and
they are not easily captured.

In Brooklyn the favorite ﬁeld of action is a slope
' in the rear of the Ridgewood Reservoir. A better
spot for the purpose could not be selected. To be-
gin with, it is right on the boundary line of the
: city and Flatbush, and it combines the safety of
seclusion with a number of natural advantages
. that attract the prey in great numbers. Prospect
Park is directly opposite, and the birds of various
feathers from that pleasure ground ﬂock together
on the slo e back of the reservoir in search or
food, wuicii is liberally Supplied for them there by
n tors and artiﬁce.

zll‘he trappers place their snares here, and in the
spring, early summer 7 good ngrvgst.
Their means of capture are both simple an e co-
tive. The favorite device is to place in the feedings
grounds upright supports, punctured borer an
there sufﬁciently to barely bold small 5 mks,
thinner than an ordinary skewer. Those sticks
are covered with bird-lime. and are so insecurely
laced that as soon as a, bird lights on one

with which the treacherous g‘eroheﬂ are Emeralile ,

the birds claws. adhere to the . and as they 3‘: to

the round the sticky substance gets on its win 3
i- and the little creature is rendered temporarl y
i helpless. In order to make assurance doubly sure.

I’ however, a due 112318 used which is drop ed over
he struggling vi ms and prevents thercscapc
l 11 case the bird-lime should not do its work mor-
on lily.
i 'lgo facilitate matters a decoy or ‘ ‘ call ?’ bird is
' used to attract others to the traps. In this con-
nection an ingenius contrlvauce is used. It is
composed of two bits of twine, a bent pin and a
lecc of wire. The twine is made into two loops.

in a Brooklyn Stable This
Morning

Being-Bitten by a i:og—--A Case Which
Interested the Veterinary Surgeons.

There was an exciting scene at the stables
of the Smith Trucking Company. at Canton street
and‘Pat-k avenue, this morning. A hasty summons
had been sent to the ofﬁcers of the Society for the
Preventlon of Cruelty to Animals and in response
to it Ofﬁcer GIOVBI‘ hurried to the stables. He found
that a frantic horse was having everYthing its own
way. The animal plunged, reared and kicked.
keeping all the stabiemen at a respectful distance
and becbming specially furious when Water at-
tractedits attention. It had been bitten by a dog
ﬁve Weeks previously. A cur caught it by the lip,
held on a moment and then ran off behaving itself
in a fashionwhich plainly showed that it was mad.

Veterinary Surgeon Henshaw, who was sent for,
dressed the wound and had the horse placed in a.
box stall. Yesterday afternoon the effects of the

horse snapped at everything within'his reach, bit-
ng the woodwork with forCe enough to break two
of its front teeth. When Ofﬁcer (allover appeared
upon the scene he was a trifle discreet in his move-

ing box stall and waited for a chance to shoot the
hydrophobia stricken brute in a vital Spot. In the
meantime the horse was emitting sounds very much
resembling the bark of a dog. With the assistance
of ﬁve men he had been lassoed so that the ofﬁcer’s
task was a comparatively easy one. A bullet went ‘
passing through its brain and, after staggering '

 

Half a dozen local veterinary surgeons assembled
at the stables last night and held a. consultation.
They unanimously agreed that it was the ﬁrst case
of equine hydrophobia with a. perfectly invnlner—
able satisfactory history that had ever come to the
surface in Brooklyn.

Some, discussion ensuediwhqiiko'h was

u,

Hill and Brown refused to follow the example
at their fellow prisoners and were, accordingly,
held in $300 each to appear a week from date
before the justice. An additional charge was
preferred against Hill by ofﬁcer W. G. Smart.
0: the SnP. U. A., of “keeping a. house for
the purpose of ﬁghting animals therein.” He
pleaded not guilty to the charge and gave ad-
ditional bonds for his appearance. '

Superintendent C. H. Hsnkinson, who with
other olﬁcers of the S. P. C. A. made the ar-
rests. was the ﬁrst Witness placed on the stand.
He. testiﬁed to entering the Pavilion, and to
seeing the crowd, the pit and the birds. He
was asked if a. diagram handed to him was a
true diagram of the interior of the Pavilion.
blow it happened that this diagram had been
stretched on the plain side of one of the big
show cards used by tobacconists. On the other
sidewere a. couple of stalwart young; females
in exceedingly transparent drapery. ‘

In handing the diagram to the wit-
ness the counsel turned it over, and
the result was that Mr. Hankinson blushed
a bewildered blush when he looked upon what he
held in his hand. His instinctive modesty

‘ csiised him to turn the ladies undermost and

so brought to view the diagram, which he said
was a true one of the pit and its surroundings.
Gr. E. Fletcher, a. lamp and oil merchant of
Flushing, was the next witness. His testimonv
that Hill had hired a big,r Rochester lamp of hint
to be used in the house, which le'mp was after-
wards found over the pit. was the link that the
prosecution needed to identify Hill as the owner
of the psvilion tor the future trial.

Alonzo F. Glover, another of the ofﬁcers, was

 

the next witness. His testimony was pre-
ceded by the bringing in of a section of the
pit—an are of wood about three feet high
padded on its interior surface and covered with
oil cloth. a basket With a rooster who crowed
lustily all the time that ho was in court, a.
‘bundlo of steel gaffe and their soft leather
bindings, a pair of scales and the
corpse of one of the feathered victims
of the ﬁght, all of which, including the corpse,
Glover swore had been seized in his presence in
the pit. He was asked to identify the prison—
ers, whom he personally assisted in arresting,
and picked out five of the six on trial.

"Where did you arrest me!” asked the doa-
con.

“1' arrested you three times. and every time

you were making a break for the bar,” an-~

swered the witness-
1 no case was still proceeding when the re-
portcr left the court. ' ‘

It was precisely 8:15 a. m yesterday when 3.
CITIZEN reporter closed the door of his resij
deuce on Bedford avenue and began tojourney
Newtown-word. And it was exactly two hours
and fifteen minutes later when he walked up
the steps of the little courthouse wherein
Justice Francis McKenna motes out law to
evil doors. In the interval the reporter had
transferred cars three times, gone wrong once
and spent weary s oils in waiting rooms twice.
By all of which it will be seen that communi—

be materially improved. '

ﬁghting, were before the justice this morning,
and hence the journeying of the reporter. The
trial was evidently looked upon by the New-
townites as a species of fete day, for the court
house was crowded by the inhabitants of the
village, all in their Sunday best, and the long
line of buggies outside of the building evi-
denced the fact that the interest in the case
was not confined to the villagers.

The prisoners were eight in number and they
were as follows: William Hill, the son of ’Arry
’111 and the proprietor. of the Pavilion, abig,
burly bulldog looking fellow, with a. swagger,
a. bullying: voice, a. watch chem live strands
thick and a peajacketwith half dollar mother- *
of—pes.rl buttons; Charles Watson was singu-
larly like Deacon Richardson, only that he had '
honest 'ﬂesh and blood on his face in place
of the pallid substance that. covers the.
deacon’s countenance; T. Willets and J.
Both were tv~\3~ young toughs, with closely
cropped hem; and a suggestion of Sing Sing be-
ing their ultimate heme. J. Anderson was a
sport with a. frost-nipped air, a big paunch and
an I-don’t-mind—if-l-do expression. Mr. Ben
Carpenter was a human ferret and John Brown
had a. white face, black hair and an evil ex-
pression-“a r‘egular Mephisto in black and
wuitegiif-I. ‘

night up a dark alley. Cock ﬁghting may be
an elevating; sport, but it appears to demoralize
the personal appearance of its votaries.

When the case was called the justice said that '
he had received a note from Lawyer R. S.‘ Dur-
rant, who was counsel for the prisoners, to the
smite—that professional engagements prevented.

When the fact became known to District-
Attorney Ridgway that John Ennis, otherwise
, known as “Big Jack,” the South Brooklyn
4F'tough. who wantonly chewed off the ear of a
big Newfoundland dog. and was sentenced by
Justice Massey to one yeaij’s imprisonment 1n
the penitentiary and to pay a ﬁne of $500, had
been released from imprisonment by Judge
Pratt on bail pending an appeal to the Court of
Se‘Ssions, he was decidedly angry. ~ He knew
nothing about the application for the release of

Ennis until informed of it by a reporter of THE

words both pointed and forcible.

John Ennis f1 cm the penitentiary, where he was
sent by Judge Massey on April "9 for one year
and sentenced to pay a ﬁne of $500 for biting OE
the end of a dog’ s ear. ‘ A writer of one of the
letters says: .0

mit Ennis to ball. is counsel demanded a jury
trial. On the day named. the case was tried and
the Jury found Ennis guilty. whereupon Judge
Massey sentenced him to one year in the peni-
tentiary and $500 fine. and to stand committed
in $1 per da until the $5 00 was paid. There is
one thing HE .Wonnn may be assured of. and
that is. our Scolety Will learn just why this man
is released. ” . .

Lawiier George .F. Elliott. the Societ ’s
counse .. was asked if he had _learned_what t e
proceedin s were through which Ennis was let
out of the enitentiary. He answered:

. ” I have only met learned for certain that he
is out. and am informed that a lawyer—I don't
know his name—went before Judge_Pratt the
latter Epart of last week With certain papers.
when nnis was admitted to bail pending the
hearing of'an appeal. I have not been able, to
conﬁrm this. as Judge Pratt is away holding
court at PoughkeepSIe. They know nothing
agiout the matter at the District-Attorney’s
o co. ”

i' The reporter went into. the Supreme Court and
looked at the book in which all cases coming into
that court in any way are sup osed to be
entered. but there was no recor of Ennis’s
case. and the clerk had no recollection of it.
Subsequently the reporter saw District-Attorney
Bidgway. who on being asked what information
he had as to John Ennis havm been let out'of
the Penitentiarypn an order 0 ‘Judge Pratt. in-

uired: "Who is, unis? What is the case ‘2”

he reporter stated the case. when the District-
Attorney said: .

‘ ‘ I know the man now you mention the name
of ‘Big. J ack,’ but I know nothing whatever
about his haying been releasedfrom prison. It
was done Without any notiﬁcation to this ofﬁce. ”

”I thought the District-Attorney had always
something to say in a matter of this kind. ”

” He s ould have. In these petty cases. how-
ever. a lawyer can 0 to a Judge of the Supreme 1
Court or County udge and, on a davit. have

n axilpeal allowed artid the prisoner bailed. pend-
ngt e hearingpn he appeal, Withoutany no- ,
tice to the District-Attorn ey or one havm any
'nowledge of it whatsoever. The law oug t to
e amended so that the party appealin? should
give notice to the District-Attorney. in order
that he might appear and oppose the admisSion
of the defendant to bail on appeal. As I said
before. this only applies to potty cases. There
are thousau s of cases in the Police Courts
where the right of appeal ex1sts. rcvided the
appeal is taken Within ten days af er .the party
is conv1cted. Anybod can sneak a prisoner out
of the penitentiary in t at Way but-it is all wrong.
the law should .be amende in the way I have
named. As to this man Ennis. e is a hard one.
He was tried not so very long ago for bur lar-
izing a store in South Brook yn. The tria was
had in the Court of Sessions. and I prosecuted
him. He was acquitted. on the ground that the
only testimony to convmt him was an accom-
lice. His accomplice was a small boy whom
nnis ut through. the fanlight to un-
fasten 9 door, inside and let him in.
We had a Witness to corroborate in
the person of a night watchman. who saw
both Ennis and the boy comm g from the store:
but on the trial of the. case the night watchman
failed to identify Ennis. which left the case rest-
ing on the testimony of the boy alone. hence the
acquittal. We afterwards found .out that the
reason the watchman did not identify Ennis was
because the latter’s gang had threatened to kill
im. I remember very well that Judge Moore
said to Ennis: ‘ I know you are guilty beyond a
doubt. but the law in this instance does not
allow me to punish on. but if ever roucome
before me again you s all have the fiil penalty..’
As to this dog case. ” continued Mr. Ridgway. " I
Will bear that in mind. ’f .
After leavmg the District-Attorney the re-

 

] porter ascert mad that Lawyer J ames P. Judge

went before ustice Pratt on Friday or Saturday
last with aﬂidaVits of Frank C. Mai-rm. _who was
Ennis’s counsel on the trial before Justice Mas-
sey. Dennis Sheehan and himself (Law er

opinion on the aﬂidaVits produced. there was a
reasonabie doubt whethfr the. judgment of con-
viction rendered agains Ennis in the dog case

he bail was ﬁxed at $000. The reporter was
unable to learn what the afﬁdawts were or who
went be for Ennis. Lawyer Judge is out of
town an Will be till the end of the week.
Ennis’s home is at No. 368 Bond street. but

 

the people there refused to say whether he had
been there within the last ﬁve or six da s. The

; police. however. attached to the First recinct

Lawyer Mari-in Fails to. Save a Man of
Revolting Crimes—«filmy Times Set at
Liberty by John Delmar When That

4 Gentlenma Was a Justice.

Notorious Jack Ennis, the South Brooklyn
tough, was arrested on April 53:5 for biting the
ear oﬂ" of a mast-iii in the saloon of Charles Mur-
ray, 1939 Butler street. He was tried before Jus-
tice Massey and .1 Jury for the offense a few days
afterward. was found guilty ani sentenced by
the magistrate to one year in the i’iienitentiary
and in addition to pay a. ﬁne of $300. The Socie-
ty for the Prevention of _-(‘rn.:-,lty to Animals,
through its counsel. George F. faint-t, prosecuted
him. He was represented on the trial by Lawyer
Frank C. Mari-in, who on the day following
made an afﬁdavit to the cii'eet that the
case had not been prolmiriy conducted by
the magistrate. The afﬁdavit was handed up to
Justice Pratt, of the Supreme Court, who, on the
strength of it, granted an order for Ennis‘ release
pending an appeal. A few days ago Lawyer
James P. Judge, who had been retained in the.
case, argued the appeal before Judge Moore.
Yesterday that magistrate deeialed that the case
had been properly conducted by the trial justice
and that Ennis must serve out the sentence and
pay the ﬁne imposed. Thereupon District Attor-
ney Ridgway issued a bench warrant for Ennis’
arrest, which was handed over to Deputy Sheriﬂ
Brennan. ,, ’

Ennis was taken into custody by Brennan on a
Court street car last evening as he was returning
home from. the races and landed in Raymond
Street Jail. He was very much surprised at his
arrest. but accompanied the officer to the lock-up
without any resistance. A strong effort was made
by his backers to save him, and it is said that an
V appeal will be taken from J udge Moore’s decision.
Ennis has given the South Brooklyn police A more
trouble during the last ﬁfteen years or more than
any half dozen men of that locality: ' He was
the leader of a notorious gang, every one of
whom werewilling to follow his lead in anything
:he sought to accomplish. He has been arrested
:gfer'nearly every crime on the calendar, and almost

I droppedin at a sale stable, and noticing one

plainly indicated that he was accustomec to be

that the old fellow and his mate were the dis-

Boston. .The man had bought a fresh Span,
and the animals that have been worn out in ‘
his service will now be sold for a song and go
from bad to worse. .
" Iimust‘confess that people who can do this

“Why don’t your own men patrol the streetcar

“They do, but we have a mere handful of men——
eight in all—so that no one can reasonably expect
us to look after every car horse from the Battery to
Woodiawu Cemetery. We have only two special
posts, one at Broadway and Twenty-third street and
the other at Fourteenth‘street and Broadway. My
men are out; in uniform all day. and at six o’clock
they go to their suppers. After that they patrol in
citizens’ clothes until a late hour. Once a week we
make an inspection of every car stable in the city
and tell the foremen not to work sick or disabled

horses. Other days in the week our attention is
directed to the stock yards. the. slaughter house and
the poultry markets. Our patrol wagon makes four

With the bodies or her two pet canartes in her
hand, and with a race that still bore the tracesot“
recent tears, Mrs. Fanny Sickles appeared in Jet-y
ferson Market Court yesterday. She had com-
plained at the Mercer street station Monday night,
as stated in THE WORLD yesterday, that a boarder
in the house No. 52 Great Jones Street, named, Inez .
Van Zandt, had killed her songsters in a most cruel
and heart-less manner. Mrs. Sicklee carried a red,
plush-covered jewel box, bound at the corners and;
edges with silver and having a silver clasp. In this“
box were the bodies of the birds, wrapped in a“:
white silk handkerchief and laid on a decoy bed or
white cotton. A colored servant, J ulla Brown, ac-
companied her. Both took seats inside the iron
rails. Mrs. Slekles was greatly excited, and while»
she held the box with both hands in front of her,

by side with their little eyes closed. -

It was a most. affecting scene. No mother ever
mourned tne death of her child more than that
woman did Sitting there with the lifeless remains
of her two feathered pets on her knee. She had {
gone to the rooms of the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals with her little jewel-i

substance of which is as follows :

[[em'y Berg/IL, Esq;
DEAR Sln-We have observed with re

lecture in New York, to prevent you from having a fair
{hearing in criticism of the tortures which are inﬂicted
upon dumb animals under the plea of medical science.
Deeply appreciating the services which you have ran.
dered to humanity as much as to the lower races of an-
imals, by your long and courageous struggle against
cruelty to them, we desire you to give the citizens of
Brooklyn an opportunity of testifying their sympathy
with your generous labors in the past, and at the same

gret and indigna-

 
   

 

 

 

time of listening to your suggestions as to the things
which remain to be done.
For this purpose we cordially invite you to repeat
in this city your lecture on vivisection, at such time as
may suit your convenience.
. Very sincerely your friends,

LONG ISLAND angelic; 2-7. 1882
Cruelty to Annuals.

Patrick Burns was brought before Judge Lei-charity
last Friday charged with cruelty to animals. From
the statement of the witnesses it seems that Burns
bought a. horse. or at least a substitute for one, and

g the poor thing broke down completely soon after it
came into Burns possession. The latter at once

m

turned the animal out into the streets to eat snow '

balls or die. The unfortunate beast wandered
i around for a. time, until his terribly emaciated con-
, ’ ' the attention of the police and
1 residents of the neighborhood, and the attention 01'
9 Mr. Henry P. Titus was called to the case. Mr.
‘Titus represents the Society for the Prevention of
’Cruelty to Animals and he caused Burns to be ar-
, rested. When before the Justice Burns said he paid
. “ twenty shillings ” for the animal, but found it p
“ no good ” and turned him loose. Judge Dele- ,
hanty sentenced him to pay a. ﬁne of $10 or to be 3
impnsoned in the County Jail for ten days. 2
said he would not pay a. cent ﬁne and would rather I
. serve out his time in the jail. He is serving it. i

Animals Tortured Alive that ExperimentaliSts

President of the Society for Prevention of

 

 

l Cruelty to Animals Allowed to Deliver a

/ Lecture in Brooklyn Unmolested, Which
Was Interrupted by Medical Students in
New York.

me

\ Mr. Henry Bergh, the staunch friend of the

. whole brute creation, delivered his anti-vivisec-

‘1 tion lecture last evening in the lecture room of
i the Long Island Historical Society Building on
Pierrepont street. The lecture was the same
that the gentleman attempted to deliver recently
in New York, but which was interrupted and
ﬁnally, broken up by a number of medical stu-
; dents. No admission was charged to the lecture
1 last evening, and, there was accordingly a very
good but diversified audience present, including
a number of ladies. In the audience were also
noticed a number of Long Island Medical Col—
lege students, HealthGommlssmner Raymond, and
several physicians. In the Hallwerc alsoanumber
of the ofﬁcers of the S. P. O. A.. who would have
doubtless summarily bounced any one who at-
tempted any interruptions. None were offered.

In fact the lecturer was listened to with mani-
fest interest, and at times applauded. The Rev.
Henry Ward Beecher presided, and in introduc—
ing the lecturer bespoke for him a careful hear-
ing. .
Mr. Bergh came forward dressed in full even- !
ing attire, with the big gold badge studded with
diamonds of the President of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals pinned to the

lappel of his dress coat. ' ' .

THE LECTURE.

Mr. Bergh immediately addressed himself to
his subject and ﬁrst endeavored by scien-
tiﬁc discussion of the subject to show that
the experiments of vivisectionists/ were utterly
unreliable so far as furnishing any practical
knowledge for the treatment of human beings.
He ducted extensively from the acknowledged
authorities to show the horrible tortures to
l which living animals were subjected in the
laboratory. Rabbits had their eyelids torn off
that the effects of light in their eyes might be
studied. Dogs had hot iron stuck into their
brains that the result might be noted down ;
horses were starved and then strychnine thrust
into their empty stomach and as they died in
terrible torture these scientiﬁc monsters stood by
and carefully watched the effect of the torture.
Live cats were torn open that the action of the ,
few last beats of the quivering heart might be
observed and many needle and lancet points had
been blunted, that had\been thrust into the bod-

for Cruelty to Annuals.

A number of prominent residents of Sixth,
Seventh and Flatbush avenues, and several well known
livery stable keepers, were interested spectators in J us-
tice Walsh’s Court this morning to listen to the pro
ceedings in the case of Mr. William N. Braiser against
Andrew L. Rogers. Mr. Phillips appeared for the
latter, and Mr. Pearsa-ll for Mr. Braiser. Mr.
Braiser lives at 58 Seventh avenue, and is a wealthy
man. He swore on the stand that he owned eleven
horses, and according to the testimony taken some
of the animals are pretty high blooded. Some

' time ago, one of his horses, which was one of three that

he had in Mr; Roger’s livery stab lo, Sterling place, near
Sl‘enth avenue, was injured in the hind feet from hav-
ing been tied between the hoofs and the fetlocks with a
piece of rope to keep it from kicking. Mr. Braiser .
swore that he did not see Mr. Roger’s tie the animal,

,because he never attended to it ; his coachman did ;
'3’and the latter told -him one morning that both the
1 horses’ hind feet had been tied together by a piece of ,

rope, and the animal. was quite lame in consequence.
Mr.,Braiser was very angry and at once commenced pro—
ceedings against Mr. Rogers upon a. charge of cruelty
to animals.

’Ebonezer Waters. a. veterinary surgeon,‘swore that he
called at Rogers’ stables on May 27, and found. both the
hind feet between the fetlock and the hoof chaiod,
swollen and sore. They were considerably inﬂamed tor
a couple of days. Horses feet should never be faswned
with a rope, always With a- strap. Mr; Rogers told the

 

wi nose that-the horse was a, kicking homeland he had _

Ar- Little Entertainment- Thaevvas Rudely l1

Interrupted by the S. P."C.' A.

On Saturday night last Superintendent Hank-
inson, of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, in company with Officers
‘Lambert, Carpenter and Smart proceeded to a
stable in the rear of Harrington’s slaughter

ihouse. at 43d street and First avenue, where
they had been informed there was to be a dog-

I}; ﬁght. It was about 9:15 when they arrived. and

peering through cracks in the shed the ofﬁcers
l saw abundant evidence of the fact that the inter-
‘ estine: event would shortly take place. Assem-

bled in the place were some 30 men gathered

i about an improvised pit three feet high.
; The two does, one 'a brindle and white and
lthe other a pure white,_. somewhat larger than
a the brindle, were being With difﬁculty restrained
‘ from ﬂying at each other. A ladder was pro-
cured. and by means of a rear window, an
entrance into the building effected. Concealing
themselves in a large vat, used for pickling
hides, the ofﬁcers watched the ﬁght.

The dogs were placed in the pit, and, a,
momentlater, being released. ﬂew savagely at
each others’ throats. From the ﬁrst the larger
dog had the worst of the encounter, and when
they were separated, some ﬁfteen minutes
latenthe was bleeding from a badly lacerated
t iroa . ,

Having witnessed the ﬁrst round and obtained
sufﬁcient evidence, Mr. Hankinson diSpatched
Oﬂicer Lambert to Captain Mount of the 51st
Street Police Station for assistance, and four
3 policemen were sent by him to aid the Society’s
‘; men in capturing the dog fighters.

In the meantime the dogs had again been set
{at work, but, as before, the smaller dos had
Eeverything his own Way, and by the time the
;police arrived the battle was virtually decided.

The third of is. series of. historical discourses

terdey morning by the Rev. John W. Mal
dealt with our relations to the brute crea
certain, said Mr. Malcolm, that {there may exist in the 3
heart of a. man or a people a. humane feeling without
sufﬁcient strength to move them or control them.
This was certainly the case with our fathers. They
had a kindly feeling toward the dumb creation but a
feeling not strong enoughyto move them as a people
to give expression to legal enactment for justice
and humanity to dumb animals.
our fathers had laws for the punishment of those
who, in a public manner, would demoralize man-
hood by their cruelties to beasts, but it was more
for the sake of shocked and horriﬁed humanity than
for the protection of dumb beasts. We ﬁnd that they
regarded the lower animals as so much property, the
same as a fence, 8. house, a tree or a farm, and as they
had stringent laws to protect property, so they had
laws to protect dumb animals as property, so that any
party who decreased the value of a. house, or a fence or
a horse could be punished by low in the days of our
fathers. This shows the low view they held of "animal
life, and in keeping with this View they acted with cru.
elties toward the dumb beasts worthy only of savages.
Their relations to the fowls of the air were equally
cruel. Now what I regard as one of our ﬁnest
tests of the growth of a. sense of justice and
humane feeling since the days of our fathers is
that dumb animals have come to be not merely proper-
ty to be proteCLed, simply as property, out of selﬁsh
motives, but that we have come to feel that they are
sentient creatures having rights in themselves in the
same way that the colored race is now regarded as hav-
ing rights in its if. Ye have come to feel that we are
under solemn obligation to respect the rights of allsen-
tient creatures. This change, which we cannot ignore
without bemoaning and debasing ourselves, is a grand
mark and test of our Christian progress as a nation.
This humane feeling has, since 100 years ago, grown so
strong that it has been articulated for the people most
clearly by Mr. Bergh whose name is known in nearly

a name for blood and martial

that has been growing, for years has been put into
words it has grown with wondrous rapidity, having
already produced a revolution in the legislation in re-
lation to dumb animals, so that at this time any man or
corporation responsible for dumb animals and abusing
them is liable to ﬁne or imprisonment or both. These l
laws on the statute books are not the ﬁtful glcams of
the meteor. They are the expression of a. great senti—
ment,’ backed by societies composed of the wealthy
and the noble, and scientists and scholars, and Grow
ernors of States have become supporters of this
Christian spirit of justice and mercy. They seek to
educate the people by tens of thousands of publications
fostering; this humane feeling. They seek to impress
the fact that cruelty toward the lower animals is a.
double sin—9. yiolation of the rights of the animals
and a brutalization of Stress who participate in the vio-
lation. It is now or; of the clearest teachings of in-
ductive science that ha who practices any wrong upon
the sentient creatures of the world debases himself,
While it is equally true that he who does an actof
mercy toward lower animals elevates himself thereby.
One of the grand way marks of our progress is the fact
that since the enactment of laws for the protection of
dumb creatures it has come to be considered that

tices it «is a criminal. This alone is a. splen.

Annnni‘1h3port of the Society for. the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.

 

 

Agency of the American Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals has just been prepared by the sac
perintendent, Mr. J. R. Pye. It opens with a brief 5
note addressed to the ladies and gentlemen interested.Pl
in this humane work, from Mr. Henry Bergh, the pres.
ident of the American society. Mr. Bergh does not
deem it necessary to indulge in any praise of the agen.
cy- in regard to its past labors and future outlook, but
modestly refers the reader at once to the detailed ex~‘ ,
hibit indicated on the following page. Neither does he’
favor the indulgence of sentiment beyond the state-
ment that “a. cultivation of the instinct of mercy to-
ward sensitive dumb creatures is indissolubly connect-
. ed with the exercise of justice and humanity among
mankind. No state or community,” he says, “ can tol-
crate the practice of cruelty even to the meanest cf

3 . God’s creatures, withoutP‘occesioning a. fatal reaction,

which is sure to make itself felt, in some form or an-
other, by every member thereof.”
THE WORK ACCOMPLISHED

by the agency during the past year constitutes, of
course, the main feature of the report. This exhibit
shows the number of arrests to have been 277 ; nunln;
ber of convictions, 254 ; number of persons sent to jail, '_ 7
30; complaints investigated, (347; disabled animals re; ;
lieved from labor, 780; disabled animals humanely

lance, 54. ,

The remainder of the report is made up of the lists
of members and contributors who have made, during
the past two years, the work of the society in this, city
self sustaining. The list of members comprises 210
names, and that of contributors 255. The names of Mr.
and Mrs. H. B. Glailin and George I. Semey are men-
tionedas life members. The fee required for a life
membership is $100 for gentlemen and $50 for Indies.
The gentleman’s annual membership fee is $10, and
that of ladies $5, In all these cases a. certiﬁcdto:_,

Four Selling Races but No Bids for the Winners

-Three Favorites Beaten on a Sticky Track,
and Mutuel Pools Paying Good Dividends.

The weather yesterday at Brighton Beach was '
both warm and bright, while the heavy track is '

slowly improvmg. A verv good crowd, even for
Saturday, enjoyed the races, for which. although
the time was slow, the contests were good.
Three of the absolute favorites were beaten,
and without there being any large paying mutu-
els, the ﬁrst four paid very acceptable ﬁgures.
One of the features of the programme was
that four of the ﬁve races had selling allowances,
owners thus being virtually able to handicap
their own horses, especially as astrong‘ mutual
admiration society appears to exist at Brighton
Beach, in which owners are loath to “bid up’-
one another’s horses, that fact being made quite
apparent yesterday, as although the winners of
the selling races. Windsail at $400; 'Iilford, $800:

’ Tunis, 800, and Puritan, $3900, may each be con-

sidered well worth more than the prices at which
they were entered. not an advance price was
offered. ~ ‘
Isaac Lopez, one of Mr. Berg’s agents. pro-
tested to W. C. Daly against starting Jess1e D. in
the steeplechase. and as the judges had the testi-
mony of a veterinary surgeon that the animal
was not in a conditionifor a hard race, they per-
mitted Jessie D. to be withdrawn. Lopez claimed
that her high hind hock joint was badly inﬂamed

when she entered the paddock after an exercis-
ing" gallon, while the veterinary surgeon stated
that she was also suifering from a weal: or
wrenchtd back.

Fox-months. and perhaps for more thanayear,
the neighborhood of Woodside, L. I., has been the'

scene of dog ﬁghts and cock ﬁghts, and probably
an occasional man ﬁght, which oﬁicers of the law
have been cognizant of and yet were helpless to
prevent.

The occurrences mentioned were always known

to have taken place, but where they took place was
kept a. secret. Wagon loads and coach loads of
roughs from New York and Philadelphia. and other

cities were always in attendance upon the sports, }

and their behavior in the surrounding country be; 1
came so outrageous that the secret of their mission 1
was ﬁnally divulged. f

Women who were in the habit of walking home- J
ward by the roads during the early evening found /
that they could do so no longer with safety.
Squads of the prowling rascals. who had been
drawn together for some dog. man or cock ﬁght,
Would step and insult them. ~

COMPLAINTS UNHEEDED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.

"We have been aware that these ﬁghts were go-
ing on somewhere about Long Island," said Super-
intendent Hankinso n, of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Anima'IS. YeswmaYi “mus
we could never obtain their location until a.
short tim'e‘"“‘a'go, ”WEMAMies from Woodmde
came tons and complained that they were in dan-
ger of insult and bodily harm at the hands of men
who came to their neighborhood late at night.
They said that they hadcompluined to the local
authorities, but that their complaints were un—
heeded, and as they suspicionecl that the obgeetL
Which drew the ruiiians together was either a ﬁght.
or some other brutal pastime, they had come to our
society for protection. ‘

A THANKSGIVING DAY SPORT PBEVENTED.

“I at once got my agents at work,“ continued the
Superintendent, "and learned from them that there
was to be 11. big dog ﬁght yesterday—Thanksgiving.

IOrination I determined to make a. raid. I started

four inches in diameter and then stick sharp tacks
through them. These they place on the bridle in
such a way that by pulling the reins the tacks pen-
etrate the horse’s ﬂesh and cause that beautiful
arching of the neck which is so much
admired. Such instances are numerous and as long
as the occupants of a ﬁne carriage can satisfy their
pride that the people are admiring the spirit and
tone of their horses, the consciousness that the ap-
pearance is false and that the animals are in pain
seems to have no weight. But here are some
relics of a very different character, which bring to
mind one of the most difﬁcult cases which we ever
had to deal with, ’7 and he pointed to a ﬁlled case.
“ These are some of the spoils we captured, when
we raided‘ Mike ’ Karney’s place in Queens County.
I tell you Karney was a keen one and he died hard.

His special line was chickens and his cocking
mains were the most brutal of any that were held
at that time. The society had been after him for
a long time. Whenever we would hear of his
appearance in any town we would immediately
‘ go for’ him but his many spies
and outposts were so well drilled that the news of
our approach always preceded ourselves, and we
would simply ﬁnd a deserted house and often with
theinscription staring us in the face, “Life is too
short to be caught napping.” His desertion of one
place would always be followed by his appearance
somewhere else, and soon the suburbs of every
Long Island town had had him at one time as a
visitor. One afternoon Officer Glover, of the
society, got notice that there was to be a big ﬁ ht
that night. We had become so well acquainted w th
‘ Mike’s’ methods that we knew the utmost caution
and secrecy must be observed. With eight men as
the whole force, and all well‘ armed, we started out.
The night was frightfully dark, not a star in sight,
and everything was in our favor. We
arrived at the place about 9 o’clock, and
by the light that appeared straggling
through the cracks in the door and the
subdued murmur of voices we knew the ‘ main ’
was in full progress. We surrounded the house as
far as we could with our little force, and when
Glover gave the signal we closed in. We had an-
ticipated the extinction of the light, and when we
entered the room eight dark lanterns confronted the
astonished ‘Sports.’ ‘Mike’ was making a
straight line for a window, but he was caught just
as he was getting out. We captured nine other
men, all spectators, that time, and all the para-
phernalia of a well-appointed chicken ‘lay out.”
These were the articles in the case, asection of a
cocking—pit and scales of ﬁnest quality, being the
larger pieces, while ranged around these were all

the minor appurtenances, such as» boxing~gloves,

gaff caps and spur saws.

“Imust tell you about this old gun,” said Mr.
Clark, as the reporter was about leaving the room,
“ for the old fellow who owned it was a very pecu-
liar character. His name was Garrity and he lived
out in Flatbush, on a little piece of property which
he possessed and which he had turned into a gar-
den. Well, that fellow’s hobby was trespass.
Let any foreign animal enter the conﬁnes of his ter-
ritory, from the genus homo to a little dog, and out
would come this gun, and something would suffer.
He did not believe in remonstrance With the brute
creation, and man only could prevail on him to
‘ stay his hand. ’ We used to have complaints made
to us nearly every day by his neighbors that a pet
dog or a valuable cow that had strayed away had
been shot by the bloodthirsty Garrity, and the only
satisfaction that could be got from him was:
‘ Well, he should not have come on my premises. ’
We succeeded in softening his temperament with a
few fines and by taking away his gun, and now
nothing is ever heard from him. “

T To the Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle .-

An article recently appeared in your paper
b relating to the removal of a horse belonging to Mr.
H. 0. Bowen from the Brooklyn Bridge in one of the
ambulances of the Society for the Prevention of Cru—
elty to Animals, making charges against our oiﬁcer
which are not only without foundation, but which
seem to have been actuated by a spirit of malice on
' ' ~ ~ ., . the part of your informant. Dr. G. H. Berna, the
“my“ 7 ' " veterinary surgeon employed by Mr. Bowen, who
was present at the time, says the statement that .

Street, and Pulls a Dog from Her Arms
ﬁ'Bergh’s Society Prepared to Make War
on the Canine Thieves.

PI am glad the UNION gave publicity to
the brutal dog catchers in its issue last
might,” said a gentleman who resides in the
immediate vicinity of Smith and Schermer-
hernﬁstreets this afternoon. The gentle-
in'it'an is a great lover of dogs and is the
owner of six well bred canines. “The
éUiNION,” cent‘inued 'he, “could go within a
stone’s threw of here and get astory about
“dog catchers. which has created more
"5;%__,,jndignation around here than one can
iffg‘iinagine. To be as brief as possible I will
1.? '3757'tell' you what 1 saw and which can be sub-
‘ stantiated by many witnesses iii-the Society
3 for the Prevention of Cruelty'to Animals
lwants to investigateit. I was awakened
'fione_smcrning not very long ago, by the
‘Iyelping of a dog and the screams of a

breath. This was about eight o’clock in
the ‘ morning. I poked my :_head
"Pout " of the window and saw a
',,,3_3':;WOman being dragged through the street
:be a common thief-I can’t call them any-
' 'ithing else—a dog catcher. The woman,
;whose name can easily be had for use, was
” hugging in her arms a pet dog. The

, eg'catcher had the dog by the hind legs
5: thud was dragging the woman and dog
3%} ,ﬁoughly through the mud. The dog was
gjjgyelping and the woman was screaming. The
ifjrumpus ~ attracted the attention
for Charles Lockwood, who lives
, _- at 49 Smith street. He is a nice old man,
about 60 years old, with a big heart and
"tender svmpathies. He rushed out of the
’3 . house evidently to protect the woman. He
pWas boiling over with indignation, and
” gave the dog catcher some pretty sharp
jtalking to. The dog catcher. however, was
:3 bound to have the dog, and, pulling a pis-
stol from his pocket, clapped the muz-
‘i' Zle of it to the side of the
201d gentleman’s head and threatened to
., :put ‘a ball through his head unless be de-
veilsted in his interference. The old man be-
mame‘frightened and then the dogcatcher
[made a dive for the dog. He pulled it out
of the woman’s arms and triumphantly
threw it into his cart. The dog was so
" roughlv treated that I thought it was dead.
It lay 111 the cart motionless, Strange to

0A use an 1m us TO GRAB IT.

‘The Society-for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals to “Go For” No. 14—A Scene
on Fulton Street Which Created Con-
,siderable Indignation.

“The dog catchers of this city are noth-
ing but a set of common thieves and brutes,”
saida ﬁnely dressed man who was stand-
ing on the corner of Fulton street and
Myrtle avenue, in front of Frank White’s
saloon, this morning, about half past ten
o’clock. “audit I only had one of Bergh’s
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty'to
Animals badges, I would take that fellow
in,” added he indignantly, pointing to an
ugly youth with a heardless face, blue and
white check shirt, dirty pants and
,a dogcatcher’s badge numbered “14.” A
UNION reporter who happened to be pass-
in g at that‘time was a witness to what pron
voked the indignant ﬂow of speech. A
pleasant-faced young man, evidently of re-
ﬁned parentage, was noticed walking along

- Fulton street carrying in his arms a pretty
black and tan pet. Just before he got to

Frank White’s saloon he dropped his pet

from necessity. The black and tan had

barely left its master‘s arms before Dog-
. catcher No.14, who had been eying the
performance, pounced down upon the little

dog, which it was plain to be seen was a

ﬁne bred animal, and gave it a brutal kick

which sent it ﬂying across the sidewalls,
when it whined piteously. Dog catchers
never travel alone, because they are afraid
they will get thrashed for the brutal man-

:ner in which they capture the pet animals.

They always go in pairs. Dog catcher No.

14 had his “chum” with him on this occa—

sion and they both were evidently

congratulating themselves upon the
opportunity afforded for capturing the pet
for a sale. The dog was kicked acress the
sidewalk, as stated above, and the dog-
catcher’s “chum,” who had not a badge,
gave it another kick to send it back to No.
14. The UNION reporter put his feet out to
stopathird kick, and then there was a
general scramble for the dog. The owner
of the dog was victorious, however. and
holding the dog tightly in his arms walked

Prevention of C‘ii‘ﬁlly‘iofihiidren. By the courtesy
of the District Attorney of New York Mr. Bergh was

2 authorized by the Attorney General to represent

him in all cases appertaining to the laws for the
protection of animals. So he held the ofﬁce of as-

sistant district attorney till his death.- .illlthmégl;l
‘ his life was a most active one he managed to n

time in which to indulge his literary inclinations.
He wrote several plays, one of which was produced

i in Philadelphia, and in addition to this hepubliehed
‘ a volume of tales wand sketches, entitled The

Streets of New York.” It was as the friend of the
dumb brute that Mr. Bergh was best known to the
public. When he started his society he was un-
polled to take the step, he said, by witnessing tire
cruelty practiced on animals in Russxa. .Upon i;
return to this country he went to Atlbany and aske

for the necessary legislation, which was readily
granted, a fact which caused Mr. Bergh to regret
that. he had not asked for more, for when he needed

 

o it was not. so easily obtained.

mg‘rhrougn all his career Mr. Bergh was the per- '
sistent opponent of vaccination and inoculation,
and he never missed an Opportunity to denounce
such men as Jenner and Pasteur. He opposed viv-
iaection, too and was conetmtly in a. wrangle With
the doctors over it. He broke up dog ﬁghting and
cook ﬁghting in the City of New York and waged rec
lentleee warfare against pigeon shooting, fox hunt-
lug and kindred Sports. He had a poor opinion of
the disciples of Isaak Walton and often declared
that ﬁshermen were natural liars. It was largely
through his efforts that clay pigeons came into use.

 

During the early years of the society Mr. Berglh
l used to patrol the streets watching for acts elf1 impel 1-
ty among the truck and stage drivers, and s a. x;
gaunt ﬁgure and t'acimrn face were well. known on
Broadway. Of late yeére he lied relinquished one

street. for the purpose of putting down their wires.
7‘5an to the storm of the past two days there has
been no work done. .The ditch was carefully pro-
tected by mounds of dirt and boarded around.
At 9 o'clock yesterday morning George Rollins,
of Hoboken, came along, driving a big truck laden
. with dressed hogs, and to which were attached

three horses. The driver urged his horses along
carelessly, when the leader came to the open ditch
and shied. Then it swerved around. throwing the
heavily laden truck against the pile of dirt, thus up-
setting it. In a moment the street and sidewalk
were covered with dressed hogs, the driver landed
in the snow. and the pole horse was pitched into
the excavation. landing at the bettom on his back,
with his legs turned up.

The police who were summoned, after arresting
the driver, went to work trying to haul up the horse
by means of ropes. Inspector Clark, of the Society
fer the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who had
heard of the accident from a car-driver. hastened
down to see what was being done. ‘ ‘ The horse,”
said Clark to a WORLD reporter, “ still lay on his
l back. The police had tried to pass ropes under
’ him. whicn would have badly cut him. I ordered

them to stop and got some of the tele-
phone men to come down the excavap
,’ tion. We quickly turned the anim l
l on his side. and as quickly put him on his feet. I
Q then got the foreman of the Telephone Company to
l throw in the dirt into the hole and kept at the

horse's head. I coaxed the animal as the dirt was

being slowly thrown down and made it trample the

dirt. In half an hour the excavation was ﬁlled up

and the unfortunate horse was walked out of the
. excavation and. trembling and covered with

Some of the sporting men are jubilant and feel

. Thames: meant: the Tracks.
_ A case came up before Judge Massey on.)
.‘Friday last, involving the right of one of the i
local horse car companies to put sand on its
tracks, the action taking the form of a crim—
inal proceeding for violation of the city
Ordinance, which is claimed to debar the
companies from following this practice.
The question is one of interest, no less
to those who suifer inconvenience from
dusty atmosphere than to the railroad corpor-
ations themselves. Yet if there is a diSposi-
tion to criticise the railroads on this point, it
should not be forgotten that the safety of the
thousands of people who patronize the horse
cars is also an important consideration at
1 stake. The eXperience of all these com—
panies has shown that? the use of sand is
requisite not only to the security of the pas-
senger, but to the protection of the animals
which are surely entitled to the largest meas—
hrs of consideration which can be shown to
them. Apart from the purely legal question
as to whether or not the right to operate a
street road does not necessarily involve the
privilege of adepting such methods as are
most conducive to the freedom of the passen—
ger from accident, there are several phases
of the controversy worthy of attention. For
instance, it has been claimed that to operate
the roads at certain times of the year without
the use of sand would be to subject the horses
to a cruelty such as would warrant prosecu-
tion by the worthy society brought by Henry
Bergh to its present ﬂourishing condition.
The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals has more than once asserted itself
under precisely these conditions, and there is
, no doubt in our judgment. that it had excellent
cause foraction. Moreover, while people, as
a rule, are not slow to bring suits for dam-
ages against railroad corporations in the
event of accident, and are accustomed,
in accord with a popular but often-
times unjust impression, 'to regard them
as so many greedy monopolies, they are
little prone to make allowance for disadvan—
'tages which have to be met and obstacles
which have to be overcome. Of the thou-
sands of people who patronize the local street

what they liked with it. Ungerland sent one of his
men to the railroad Stables, and the horse was led
from there to Ungerland’s place. This was on
Wednesday. While at Ungerland’s an operation
of some kind was attempted on the horse, but it
grew so much worse that they concluded not to
keep it any longer in their stables. It was froth- ‘
ing at the mouth and convulsed. In this condition 1

lace at Brownsville, in the Twenty-sixth

ard, two miles and a half from their
stables. When Mulvaney had led the horse
about a block andahslf t fell at the corner of
Brooklyn avenue and Herkimer street. A crowd
of people gathered around it, and as it kicked and
writhed in its agony Mulvaney pulled at it to try
and get it on its legs again. The spectators were
outspoken in their denunciations and summoned a
policeman from the Twelfth Precinct. _Directly
the officer arrived he notiﬁed Superintendent
Clark, who went at once and put the poor beast
out of its agony by planting a bullet in its brain.
Mr. Clark then arrested Mnlvaney and tookhim
before Justice Kenna, who ﬁned him $10 or Jail for
ten days. As the railroad people were the rimary
cause of the trouble, the Society for the reven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals will probably proceed .
against them. It is believed that the horse was_in-
jured in the hoof while being shod and lockJaw
followed. ' ,

Another case of cruelty to a horse was brought
to the society by Veterinary Surgeon Max Hartvig-
son, of No. 74. Himrod street. The surgeon com-

Mr. Pye is a native of Louisville. Ky.. a wealthy
gentleman, seventy-ﬁve years of age. hale and
hearty. and devoted to the society of which he is
, the» solicitor. He was the mainstay and most
prominent coadjutor of Mr. Bergh, during the lite- i
L. time of that philanthropist, organizing a branch of ’
the society in Cincinnati and other prominent

cities, and devoting his means largely to further- 1
mg the cause WhiCh -he has espoused with heart .
and soul. Learning: the purposes oi the Knights of
Honor of the United states, he applied for honorary ‘
membership in the organization and was duly initi-
ated at the last meeting. The rooms were hand-
somely decorated. and the proceedings were
honored by the presence or Supreme nepresent-i
ative Frederick Otten. , 1

At the close of the lnitiatory ceremonies Brother
Pye was introduced to the lodge by Brother Her-

8 man S. Johnson in a short but eloquent eulogium ,

upon the services of the gentleman to the friends "i
of mankind. Mr. Pye responded in a reply, which

of vivid eloquence has not been surpassed in any ‘

BIRD SLAUGHTERERS.

A Rendezvous for Them on Prospect
Place.
Tome Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle:

My attention W213 called to a letter in your Sun-
day paper of the islet inst», headed —“ Bird Kill-

; ere.” While sympathizing fully in the writer‘s

statements with regard to the milliners and other
bird Slayers, I call upon the police to put a. stop to
these abominable bean shooters, and also upon
the Audubon and Bergh societies td'empower their
members to arrest any man or boy having one in

2 their possession. 011 Prospect Place, between

Bedford and Nostrand avenues, is an old dilapi-
dated farm house, situated in its own grounds of
di1t and ﬁlth, which is a rendezvous for a set of
vicious boys who daily, Eundays included, make
a perfect war on. every unfortunate bird that
comes anywhere near this mud hole. Lurking
behind the broken down old barns, they open a
fusillade upon them when they alight for food, or
up and down , the streets, standing under the
trees and ﬁring up as the little creatures seek
their night resting places, they chase them about
from place to place. These miscreants are never
interfered with apparently. Nota policeman is
in sight and very few persons pass that way.
Now, it is against the law to use these infernal
instruments of torture, and I understand the
Beigh oil’: so 111 can take them away and break
them up; but why IS the sale of them not stopped
altogether" . Meanwhile, I hope some one Will be
sent to the neighborhood without delay and save

that a big cock ﬁght was to take place at a well-

,of the affair and so thoroughly covered the sus-

beating around 'on the outskirts of the city, the
~ sporting men gave up the job. A number of ofﬁcers

‘A DOG-FIGHTING "POLICEMAN. ‘

N0; 1,940‘FOUND BUSY AT A BATTLE nuns!) 13r-

OFFICERS OF THE S. P. C. A.
Policeman 1,940 was the most prominent person
in sight when ofﬁcers of the Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals raided a dog ﬁght at
nine o’clock last night. Policeman 1,940, in full
uniform, with his helmet on and his club dangling
from his belt, was taking care of the losing‘d’og‘.

The latter was a most thoroughly whipped animal, .

andgthe bluccoat was sponging the blood off him.
By the guardian of the peace stood a small boy, to
whom he was giving instructions about where to
take the defeated ﬁghter.

Superintendent Hankinson, of the Society for the
Prevention of Crueltyr to Animals, received a. tip at
three o’clock yesterday afternoon that the fight
was to take place in Bloomingdale Brothers' stables.
on Sixty-fourth street, between Second and Third.
avenues. It had been gotten up very quietly and
every precaution had been taken to prevent any
word reaching the Bloomingdales of the purpose for
which their premises were to be used. The ﬁght
was billed to take place between half-past nine P. M. .
and midnight. 1‘

At nine o'clock Ofﬁcers Lambert, Snowden and
Gray, acting on instructions from Mr. Hankinson.g
arrived at the place. They had not been invited,;
but they meant to get in. The big doors of the 3
stable were closed and they were at ﬁrst in a quanu
dary, until presently one of the ﬁrm’s dry goods
wagons drove up and the doors Opened to admit it.
Then the ofﬁcers slipped in.

Halfadozen dudes and a party of sports were:
standing around on the wagon or round ﬂoor.
Policeman 1,940 was there, nursing his dog in the
way that has been already described.

When he saw the oﬁicers he turned as pale as a
ghost and dropped the dog. He was so ﬂabbergasted
that he looked as if he didn’t know whether to club

 

REPROACHER FOR THE BLUECOAT.

“This is a ﬁne business for a policeman to be in,”'
said Ofﬁcer Lambert sneeringly. Then he seized
the dog and the policeman disappeared. So did the
dudes and the sports, and the oﬂicers had the
stable to themselves. They went out of every avail-‘
able window and door. ’ r

“We couldn’t arrest any one." said Lambert afteiu
ward, “for it was all over, and there was no evidence
that those there had participated in the ﬁght."

The dog that Policeman 1,940 had been nursing
was a brindled bull terrier named Jack, weighing
about 24 lbs. He was believed to belong to
Mr. 1,940. Round his neck Was a collar with a
tag on it, showing that the terrier had been regis-
tered in the Brooklyn license books of 1888. The
license number was 3,498.

Poor “Jack” was in a terrible plight. His two fore-
legs were chewed right through and his right hind
leg was half bitten oii'. - Both ears were severed, the
left one being torn in two. There was a. cut an inch
and a half over his eye. His opponent had also
got what is called the "neck hold." and had torn
the ﬂesh terribly. Altogether the animal was hors
ribly maimed.

“CARLO” WAS THE WINNER.

The ofﬁcers then searched for the other dog. They
found him on the third ﬂoor covered over with
straw. He seemed to know that he had been break-
ing the law and tried to hide. This animal is known
as “Carlo,” and is a yellow bull dog weighing about
twenty-six pounds, and more than a match for
“Jack.” “Carlo” is owned by a man named Don-
nell. A good many bites could be seen on him, but
he was in splendid trim compared with “Jack.”

Both animals were tied up at the headquarters of
the society, Twenty-second street and Fourth ave<
nue, where I saw them last night. They are hand—
some fellows, and they licked my hand and wag ed

 

 

their tails when I patted them. Though wit in
sight of each other they did not want to continue
the ﬁght. It was plain that they had buried the
hatchet. .

“I shall ‘go’ for that policeman,” said Mr. Bankin-
son. “It is probable that he got off for an hour or
so to attend the ﬁght. Superintendent -Murray will.
receiVe a full-report of the whole thing. . ' ‘ ‘
