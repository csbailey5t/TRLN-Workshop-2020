97b"? Steel-Tootbed Rabbit Tm];

 

 

SIR WILLIAM BEACH THOMAS, the noted author and humanitarian, once wrote:—-

“ The steel—toothed trap, of which at least 100,000 are in use in Britain to—day, might
be taken as a symbol of the torture chamber. It looks as vicious as it is. It inﬂicts
great pain on the animals it is set to capture, and maims brutally a great number

of animals which are unintended victims .....

The steel trap catches indiscriminately; many thousands of dogs, cats, sheep, foxes, birds and
other types of creatures are killed or maimed by it each year, while it is estimated that wiry—521w

Mil/i072 rabbits annually are caught in it. The aggregate sum of suﬂering involved deﬁes imagination.

There is one obvious solution to this problem—the steel—toothed trap ”my; be abo/zlv/Jed b} [422).
The R.S.P.C.A., which has fought for the abolition of the trap for many years, has done much
to arouse public opinion, and, by the introduction of humane methods of rabbit catching, has
shown that even rabbit—infested areas can be controlled without resort to the steel-toothed trap.
The Society needs urgently not only the sympathy, but the amine support of every animal-lover

in its campaign to abolish this trap.

VICTIMS or THE
STEEL-TOOTHED TRAP!

 

 

‘YOU REALISE THAT

Millions of rabbits are caught every year in
the steel—toothed trap, and often linger for many

hours with shattered or lacerated limbs?

Surely this unnecessary torture should not be
tolerated in a country which is known as a

nation of animal lovers P

You can help to prevent this cruelty

By urging the use of humane methods recom-
mended by the R.S.P.C.A.

By arranging a demonstration at which the Society’s

expert can demonstrate humane methods.
By refusing to buy or to eat trapped rabbits.

By passing this information on to your friends.

Further details regarding humane devices will be gladly supplied by the Chief Secretary,
R.S.P.C.A., 105, Jermyn Street, London, S.W.1.
