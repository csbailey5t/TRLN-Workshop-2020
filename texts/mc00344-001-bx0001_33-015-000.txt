Dear like. Stevens,

Ixi'ajor E‘Eume sent me the draft of your boolfet for animal technicians.
I am afraid in the time that he gave me I have not had time to do more than
glance at it myself. iMr, Porter has been through it and has a few comments to
make which I enclose. In View of the very short time that he has had for this, I
feel obliged to ask you when publishing this booklet not to indicate in any way
that this Bureau has given its blessing, for I feel that given more time the criti—
cisms of both of us might have been much more fundamental, even allowing for the
fact that you have set yourself an extremely difficult task. Howevex‘, if these
comments are of any help to you, you are welcome to make use of them without any
acknowledgement.

Yours sincerely,

PK

Basic Care of Animals

If you need to take a dog’s tem-
perature or restrain a tigerish cat or
maintain the morale of a sick monkey
or feed an axolod or mark some mice
or tame a rat or bed down a rabbit
or kill a turtle—there’s a lovely book
for you.

Trouble is unless your hospital
keeps laboratory animals, you are nor

16m; £90925:

going to get this book. That’s too
bad because it is free, informative
and makes you a kinder person.

In the June issue, the Roving Re-
porter mentioned at some length a
publication called "Comfortable Quar-
ters for Laboratory Animals.” This
Other book, called “Basic Care of Ex-
perimental Animals,” is a companion
piece, and it’s a good job of work.

built-in protection of Perm-A-Lator
Wire Insulators. No matter what you
pay, you’ll get more for your money
and much longer lasting products. This
EXTRA VALUE costs no more—so

Today a sizable number of persons
are employed in laboratories that use
animals for experimental purposes.
This booklet has been prepared es-
pecially for newcomers in this ﬁeld.
The Animal Welfare Institute, which
publishes it, is an organization rep-
resenting the combined interests of
experimental biology and animal pro-
tection. Its publications are based on
the premise that bOth science and
humanitarianism are served by keep-
ing laboratory animals contented and
healthy.

The Universities Federation for
Animal Welfare in London pioneered
in publishing this type of informa-
tion; 25 biologists with long experi-
ence working with different species
collaborated on two valuable publica-
tions. Other countries are following
suit.

Any worker with laboratory ani-
mals who wants the animals to like
and trust him, who wants to keep
the animals healthy and contented,
and who wants to keep their quarters
clean, dry and comfortable can get
“Basic Care of Experimental Animals”

stitute, 350 Fifth Avenue, New York

CORTISONE AND CORTICOTROPIN IN _';-.IRHEUMATIC FEVER AND JUVENILE
RHEUMA’EOID ARTHRITIS J

Joseph JE‘Bunim, Ann G. Kuttner, Jagﬁfet S. Baldwin, and Currier McEwen. (Belle-
vue Hospital’xNew York.) J. Am. Med; Assoc., 150, 1273—8 (1952).

Anemia, an elevated erythrocyte sedingfentation rate, increased concentration of serum
ﬁbrinogen and globulin levels, and th/é appearance of C—reactive protein (CRP) in the
blood are among the-.nonspecific manifestations of rheumatic fever. A more sensitive
index of rheumatic activity than ;;*‘the sedimentation rate is a precipitin test for
detecting the protein that appearsjf’in the patient’s serum during rheumatic activity
and disappears when thei‘inflamrri'atory process subsides. All cases with acute rheu—
matic carditis treated witlik_cortis§ne or corticotropin were tested at frequent intervals
for C—reactive protein before, during, and after hormone therapy. Tests were strongly
positive before treatment, only p'ne did not become negative after a week or two after
commencement of therapy, usually before the sedimentation rate reached normal.
C-reactive protein usually reappeared when hormone administration was discontinued
and when rheumatic activity‘i continued the reaction persisted. During such therapy
the disappearance of C-react‘ive protein is not indicative that rheumatic activity has
subsided. .g." \‘3

In some cases, clinical manifestatipns of the disease may not recur, but the sedi-
mentation rate may riseﬁor C—reactiVe protein may return but may not be accom-
panied by a rise in the ahtistreptolysiig—O titer.

DETERMINATION OEziC-REACTIVE Pi'wTEIN IN THE BLOOD As A MEASURE
OF THE ACTIVITY or]? THE DISEASE PROCESS IN ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER

Harold C. Anderson and Maclyn McCartﬁxtHospital of Rockefeller Institute for
Medical Research,5New York.) Am. J. Med.,““§, 445—55 (1950).

: a.

A precipitin test ,éombining rabbit antiserum and the patients’ serum in capillary
tubes with subsequent incubation at 370 C. for twbe‘hours and overnight refrigeration
at 4° C. is described. Antistreptolysin 0 (A80) and titostreptokinase (ASK) titers
were used also in studying the cases. XV

Results of the" survey on the occurrence of C-reactive'».protein in patients with acute
rheumatic fever gives perhaps the most sensitive indicativpn of the disease process. In
the early recovery period C—reactive protein may be absent when the sedimentation
rate is much higher than normal. Other diseases with closely related clinical pictures
such as rheumatoid arthritis and subacute bacterial endoca‘nditis also are character-
ized by the presence of C—reactive protein. Once the diagnosis of rheumatic fever is
made the test is of real value in the follow—up treatment as a measure of the activity
of the disease process. It is probably the most sensitive test for the presence of
rheumatic activity presently available.

Miss Estella Draper

350 Fifth Avenue

New York 1, N.Y.

Dear Miss Draper,

Thank you very much for your patience and the reminder
contained in your letter of 25 March referring to our corres-
pondence regarding the Spanish edition of "Basic Care of
Experimental Animals".

I have made a search throughout the Bureau for the letter
and booklets requested from you to be sent to the Zone Offices

and I am.sorry to say that no record exists of these having
been received.

EMming the past few months, however, there have been
several enquiries from countries in Latin America on the "Care
of EXperimental Animals" and I can tell you definitely that the
Spanish editionuwould be very helpful as there is a definite
need for a publication of that type.

I have taken into consideration the known needs in Latin

American countries and the number of libraries and would suggest
1,000 copies.

I am sending you with my compliments copies of our latest
publications, by separate mail. Thank you again for your interest.

I remain,
Sincerely yours,

' ' ,«y’ WMffm/gxcfd

Dr. M. E. Bustamante,

Dear Miss Draper:

Thank you for your letter of 23 July and copies
of "Basic Care of Experimental Animals" , which most as-
suredly, will be very useful to us.

We believe that your idea to publish a Spanish
edition of this Manual for distribution in Latin America is
excellent. It presents the subject clearly and concisely, with
very good illustrations, and as such would be of great help
in the laboratories in all Latin American countries.

We regret that there is no provision in our budget
which would enable us to print the Manual in Spanish; how-
ever in case it is possible for your to proceed with your plan,
we shall be very glad to review the Spanish text when it is
ready.

Sincerely yours,

NEW YORK 19. N.Y.

J UDSON 6-3180

At the suggestion of
I am sending you under separate cover a copy'of a new manual
published by the.Animal welfare Institute, ”Basic Care of
Experimental Animals". It was prepared especially for use by
those who take care of the animals, and we should be glad to mail
copies without charge to any of these workers whom you may wish
to designate or to other persons you believe would be interested.

Your suggestions concerning this manual
or other material in this field which you would consider useful
would be welcome.

Sincerely,

Christine Stevens
President

 




 

 

To Users of the AWI manual, "Basic Care of Experimental Animals":

We wish to ask your advice based on your experience with ”Basic
Care of Experimental Animals". Only a few copies remain of the 7,500 which
were printed. We are considering two possibilities: l) Revising and
reprinting the manual in approximately the same form as it now exists, or
2) Producing a different type of manual for the training of animal technicians
or caretakers. It has been suggested, in the latter category that A) a com-
plete set of lectures for a training course be published or BS lecture
outlines for a training course be published.

Your experience with our present manual would be a most valuable
snide to us, and we should greatly appreciate your response to any or all of
the following questions:

1) Should "Basic Care of Experimental Animals" be kept in print?

A) If so, what additions and corrections would you like to see
made? (detailed criticism and suggestion is invited}

B} Would you wish to have a copy or copies of a revised edition?

2) Would you prefer to have a manual for training animal room
personnel which would be used by the teacher of the course
instead of being addressed to the person being taught?

A) If so, in what form would you like to have it appear?

B) Have you taught such a course? (suggestions on teaching
methods, lecture notes, etc., are invited.)

3) Would you like both publications, or one that has not been
mentioned? (If so, please specify)

Thank you very much for your attention to this communication. We
are anxious to provide the materials best suited to ensuring first-rate care
and humane treatment,for laboratory animals in all institutions using them,
and your assistance would be much appreciated. A self-addressed envelope is
enclosed for your convenience in replying.

Attention: Estella Draper
Executive Secretary

Dear Miss Draper:

Receipt is acknowledged of your letter dated
April 30, lQSh and one copy of the work entitled BASIC
CARE OF EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS.

If this work has not already been published,
that is, if copies have not yet been placed on sale, sold
or publicly distributed without the statutory notice of

COpyright, the notice of copyright, "Copyright l95h by
Animal Welfare Institute" may be affixed by rubber stamp
or otherwise to the inside front cover of all the copies.
When publication with notice has begun, two copies of the
best edition then published should be deposited with an
application on Form A.

However, we wish to emphasize that it would serve
no purpose to add the notice of cepyright if publication
has already occurred without the notice of copyright (as
your letter seems to indicate), since copyright in a work
of this character is either secured or lost at the time of
first publication depending on whether the published copies
bore the statutory notice of copyright. Subsequent pub-
‘lication with notice of copyright would not remedy the
defect of prior publication without notice nor would it
permit registration of a copyright claim. Even if a new
edition were prepared, it would not be possible to copy—
right material in that edition which had been previously
published without the cepyright notice. However, copyright
might be secured for new work of authorship contained in a
new edition if it bears adequate notice of copyright from
the time of first publication. '

Sincerely yours,

mediately following.

Promptly after such publication with the

CORTISONE AND CORTICOTROPIN IN RHEUMATIC FEVER AND JUVENILE
RHEUMATOID AxRTHRITIS

Joseph J. Bunim, Ann G. Kuttner, Janet S. Baldwin, and Currier McEwen. (Belle~
vue Hospital, New York.) J. Am. Med. Assoc., 150, 1273-8 (1952).

Anemia, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, increased concentration of serum
ﬁbrinogen and globulin levels, and the appearance of C—reactive protein (CRP) in the
blood are among the nonspeciﬁc manifestations of rheumatic fever. A more sensitive
index of rheumatic activity than the sedimentation rate is a precipitin test for
detecting the protein that appears in the patient’s serum during rheumatic activity
and disappears when the inflammatory process subsides. All cases with acute rheu—
matic carditis treated with con isone or corticotropin were tested at frequent intervals
for C—reactive protein before, d ring, and after hormone therapy. Tests were strongly
positive before treatment, only one did not become negative after a week or two after
commencement of therapy, usually before the sedimentation rate reached normal.
C~reactive protein usually reappeared when hormone administration was discontinued
and when rheumatic activity continued the reaction persisted. During such therapy
the disappearance of C—reactive protein is not indicative that rheumatic activity has
subsided. ' ‘x,

In some cases, clinical manifestations‘of the disease may not recur, but the sedi—
mentation rate may rise or C-reactive protein may return but may not be accom-
panied by a rise in the antistreptolysin-O titer.

DETERMINATION OF C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IN THE BLOOD AS A MEASURE
OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE DISEASE PROCESS IN ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER

Harold C. Anderson and Maclyn McCarty. (Hospital of Rockefeller Institute for
Medical Research, New York.) Am. J. Med., 8, 445—55 (1950).

A precipitin test combining rabbit antiserum and the‘“patients’ serum in capillary
tubes with subsequent incubation at 37° C. for two hoursand overnight refrigeration
at 4° C. is described. Antistreptolysin O (ASO) and titostreptokinase (ASK) titers
were used also in studying the cases. ’ ,

Results of the survey on the occurrence of C—reactive protein in patients with acute
rheumatic fever gives perhaps the most sensitive indication of the disease process. In
the early recovery period C-reactive protein may be absent when the sedimentation
rate is much higher than normal. Other diseases with closely related clinical pictures
such as rheumatoid arthritis and subacute bacterial endocarditis also are character-
ized by the presence of C-reactive protein. Once the diagnosis of rheumatic fever is
made the test is of real value in the follow—up treatment as a measure of the activity
of the disease process. It is probably the most sensitive test for the presence of
rheumatic activity presently available.

Dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you for the November - December information report.
appreciate receiving your most interesting announcements.

I am particularly interested in the manual "Basic Care of
Experimental Animals”. I would like to send copies to our

salesmen. I wonder if as many as 50 conies would be available‘
for us.

I know that you are interested in distributing the Manual to
those who handle experimental animals. Would you care to have
us include the Manual in a list of free bulletins that are
available to Schools of Medical Technology. We are about to
send 25 copies of a list of Manuals as a special mailing to
prominent Schools of Medical Technology to see if they would
like us periodically to keep them posted on the availability
of helpful bulletins. If you would like to have us include

r“)

your Manual then we would need an additional a; copies.

Another possibility is to mention the Manual in a column in our
Monthly Bulletins in which we will list helpful manuals that can
be obtained from various organizations. We would plan to have
the readers write direct to your office.

Sincerely,

New York 1 , New York

Dear Mrs. Stevens:

It has come to my attention as Chairman of the Cosmlittee on
Animal Care that we had declined the offer of your free pamphlet on
animal management. I find that we have a copy in our Office of Animal
Care , and I have examined your pamphlet and find it extremely well
prepared and constructive. I have compared the criteria contained in
your pamphlet as regards space, food, and bedding requirements for the
various animal species with our existing practices and with our plans
for future expansion of animal facilities. Since our practices are
expected to become the standard with which animal research facilities
in the State will be camarad, I am pleased to find that your proposals
and our practices and plans are in essential agreement. I would
appreciate receiving three additional copies of your pamphlet for use
by the Comittee on Animal Care.

I regret that we may have appeared to reject the offer of a
copy of your pamphlet when it had apparently been our intention only
to decline the offer because a copy was already available on this
campus and becuase we have felt secure under the guidance of Dr. Karl
F. Meyer. Your cements about Dr. Bennett Cohen were received with an
open mind. I have taken the steps necessary to reach the conclusion that
the policies and practices which Dr. Cohen is participating with us in
establishing will be in keeping with the spirit of your organization.
We are pleased to have Dr. Cohen with us and 13%. that he has not only
the pleasant personality to which you referred, but also a large measure
of veterinary and administrative ability which has been useful to the
Comittee on Animal Care.

 




We will be happy to receive not only the three copies of your
pamphlet but am additional literature pertinent to animl care which
you may have aVailable in the future.

Very sincerely,

Dear Miss Stevens:

we have received a copy of your manual entitled "Basic Care
of Experimental Animals" and appreciate your kind offer to
provide copies for persons handling animals.

However, our own "Rules Regarding nnimals" adequately covers
the recommendations given in your pamphlet, and since all of
our investigators and persons caring for animals are thoroughly
trained in the proper handling technique and the humane care
of animals, we feel that further basic instruction would be
unnecessary.

Again thanking you,

Very sincerely,

John H. Lawrence, M; D.

Your letter to Mr. R. J. Buettner has been referred to me.
The data included in your booklet on animal care will be kept in

procedures now being suggested both by your group and the
Animal Care Panel for over five years and have had a very
successful operation.
