Ibar Sir or Madam,

This is a begging letter - but, before it goes into the
wastepaper basket, may I tell you very briefly what would happen
to your kind contribution (however small) if only you were able
to spare it?

Firstly, it would make things better for animals by helping
us to devise and introduce up to date humane methods of dealing
with them (e.g. humane management and care of laboratory animaks,
painless killing of wild rabbits, painless electrocution and
stunning etc.).

Secondly, it would help us to instil into young university
men and women (who will eventually have great influence on public
opinion) a concern for humane principles, which they can later apply
in their professions“ Some of these students will become veterinary
surgeons and research workers and thus have direct opportunities
for practising such principlesn

For both these very necessary activities UFAW urgently needs
funds, as you can well understand; and so, if you could possibly
just spare something — even, say, half what you would have Spared
if you had been able to Spare it ~,it would, I promise you, be
used to very good purpose indeed.

Yours very gratefully,
FOUGASSE

(Chairman).

P.S. You very kindly purchased some of our Christmas goods last
year. ' o
