Selected Peems of May Sarton

Eine Kleine Snailmusik

The snail watchers are interested insnailsfrom all angles. . . . At
the moment they are investigating the snail’s reaction to music,
“We have played to them on the harp in the garden and in the
country on the pipe,” said Mr. H eaton, “and we have taken them
into the house and played to them on the piano.”

The London Star

What soothes the angry snail?
What’s music to his horn?
For the “Sonata Appassionata,”
He shows scorn,

And Handel

Makes the frail snail
Quail,

While Prokofieff

Gets no laugh,

And Tchaikovsky, I fear,
No tear.

Piano, pipe, and harp,
Dulcet or shrill,

Flat or sharp,

Indoors or in the garden,
Are \xilly—nilly

Silly

To the reserved, slow,
Sensitive

Snail.

\Vho prefers to live
Glissandissimo,
l’ianissinm.

\{The Death of a Toad‘

A toad the power mower caught,
Chewed and clipped of a leg, with a hobbling hop has got
To the arden verge, and sanctuaried 5 him
Under 51c cineraria leaves, in the shade
Of the ashen heartshaped leaves, in a dim,
Low, and a ﬁnal glade.

The rare original heartsblood goes,
Spends on the earthen hide, in the folds and wizenings, ﬂows
In the gutters of the banked and staring eyes. He lies
As still as if he would return to stone,
And soundlessly attending, dies
Toward some deep monotone,

Toward misted and ebullient seas
And cooling shores, toward lost Amphibia's emperid.‘

Day dwindla, drowning, and at length is gone
In the wide and antique eyes, which still appar
To watch, across the castrate lawn,

The haggard daylight steer.

 




THE BABY BIRDS

Six weeks the baby birds
_Squatted in their neSt,
*COmfortable as pillows
While mama disappeared

” ‘ And reappeared, .

Her beak thick with worm.

Down the stretched throat

She tWeezered each piece.

Not until every fluted mouth had silenced*
VAnd every blueberry eye had closed

Did she sleep,

Feather overlapping feather

Over the ugly birthooats of her children.’

But today is different.

Her eyes bulge like the jewels of idols.
Her talons tuck under her, -

a Two empty meatahooks. .

She swoops-from branch to branch-

While her children cower. '

'They bunch against each other like kittens.
They squeal like pigs.

yTheir mother has become a strange god.
-She brings them the sky. '

 




 
 

 

 

Daughters with Toad

Unblinking thing, as absolute as clay.
Fumed from the dank by my mower's snarl, he muses.
NV daughters find him, and their squeals propel,

bounce him from his mope, ringing him with glee.

With sly, leary touch they probe his ayethy ,
unearthed-~half-thrown, with lurching, bloated thump
he falls. They toy and stroke, forgive his piss,

his pebbled hide, coo to his bulbous stare.

Squat in their palms, he thrills them with his pulse.
They lean near, enraptured by his ugliness,

wild hair burnished down round him in bright waves.
And they whisper, foreheads almost touching.

Then each brings her lips to meet that grim crack
of torpid mouth. They return him to grass '
to await the kisses'transformation.~

Nothing. The pale throat only swells the air

and flutters, emits one pathetic croak.

They laugh, and to the toad, their teeth so fine
must gleam like the teeth of little foxes.
Uneaten, he ponders on, abandoned.

 

My daughters are not sad. The day will be
husband enough, obedient to whim--

a royal ball. They waltz toward lunchtime,
assuring me he spoke to them in prince.

 




or I should think that if tomorrow I awakened blind,
I could not feign, nor like the birds forget, I once knew light.

There was dessert, and Cook—she’s new this week—
had done a torte.

If only that had sated! Instead I tried their patience,
argued how poorly the birds look afterward, battered, dull,
all their feathers bent. At which Albert pointed his teaspoon
to his ear, and his eye, “Less to behold, more to be heard,”
and Father thumped the linen like a Bible, reciting,
“An eye for an eye....” and laughing that he ﬁnally gave
the passage purpose, religion, a place at his table.
I could hear no more, and deaf to reason—was I crying?—
shouted, “What is beauty but the eye of the beholder?”

’

and ran out—crying then, I’m sure—“Blindness for blindness...’

Misgivings are what we cannot give away, Theresa,
how we ask ourselves forgiveness. If only you could hear
the birds!
All the songs have changed. They add whistles and rasping
noises,
droning like a ﬁle that wears down the air, ﬂat to the ground
and is itself worn down. I know it is I who have changed,
grown deaf to their song. Now there is no music, no silence:
a rest is still another note, tlv’o‘ugh I sound it, more. news
of Spring returning to the window ledge, three dozen doves
without one sprig of green. Even letters are no respite
though I send this, add it to the others as Albert adds
new birds. Beneath impertinences that cannot be hidden,
please find the voice of a loving sister, your

Elizabeth

 

 

 

 




Penn's Relations

 

Inside the carefully worded letters are snapshots
of his children's children, always taken at the zoo:
a baby goat slung in his youngest's arms,
We can’t adopt another kid, is labeled

on the back; Peacocking around the children's park;

and, holding their ankles, Duckéwalking with ducks.

Each year they pose beside their favorite cages,
perhaps so Penn can judge how much they've grown.
That newborn llama had already given birth

while his grandchildren climbed through school.
Koalas, sea-lions, the otters in their annual
underexposed portrait, he might as well

consider relatives. Distant: relatives.

 




[new stanzal'
No customers until Greater Cleveland,

Penn decides to visit a 200; it's Monday,

and, for a pleasant change, more animals

than people. But the pachyderms are hidden from the heat;

the birds, concealed in leaves (their songs in glass);
the antelopes, stoic; the reptiles, mimicking twigs;

and the big cats are, well,...catatonic,

Penn pronounces just to make himself laugh.

In the Great Ape House, the gorillas are eating
oranges, and a dozen adults (from a group home?)

are slapping the protective glass, stretching their lips,
pretending to rattle the bars, swing and shriek,

doing whatever the placid beasts were not.

The one perturbable primate, Penn, is back

in the car. He has found his address book,
an indelible marker, a postcard of a dolphin
(his favorite) Skipping backwards on its tail,
and a twice-read letter from the morning mail:
Grandpa, you know the guinea pig you bought us?
Dad says that if I hold it upside down

its eyes will fall out. 'It’s not true, is it?

In handwriting more at home with numbers,

Penn is printing, Leave it right—side up-—

just to be safe. A month has passed. To be KIND,
is what he meant to write. Just to be KIND,

is what he'll say, given another chance.

 




II.

 

Concession

Inside a concrete hippo concession stand--
gigantic jaws that welcome all the hungry,
thirsty, curious and out-of—film--—

Penn purchases a range of overpriced
mementos: a cap that reads I (Q Penguins,

a silk-screened shirt, It’s a jungle out there,
and a kit labeled Make Your Own Zoo.

These he'll mail to the children of the children
that he brought to this same zoo as a father,
years before talk of inhumane conditions,
exploitation, and the likely extinction of most
of what a human comes in contact with,

including his own protected kith and kin.

Admission

Packing the presents at home, Penn can't resist

a peek at the shrink-wrapped zoo, and slits the kit
above the letters that boast, Bring the animals
home! with smirking serifs and grinning eyes.

He spreads the creased plastic site plan

across his dining—room table, a flattened

ground of isolated trees, dirt

corrals, blockhouses, concrete pools

(the blue of the concession‘s Sno—cones),

and a white stitch of fences, patching

together a sampled and all too simplified world.

 




[same stanza]

The captive animals are minted and scored

on a separate sheet, an interlocking jumble
dumped from an ark or another deliverance.

Lift off...adhere...shift...remove...

eventually, lose: These are the tacit
instructions; that, it seems to Penn, is

the nature--the natural order-~of things, things

being whatever it is a person handles.

e 10
He peels free a small selection of beasts
and fits each into its destined habitat:
Square as an ice cube, the polar bear
will float in the square pool. He is not the bear
Penn watched at the zoo, a pendulum pacing
the jetty as if to prove, again, the earth
rotates. Waiting their turns, the seals can swim
the second pool, provided with a bucket of fish
and a striped beach ball for entertainment.
But where--there isn’t water for the crocodiles,
the trio of sleeping flamingoes, hippo, or swans?
And what enclosure can hold the elephant
or even the baby elephant whose trunk is lifted
to take her mother's tail? Could they be concrete
like the hippo concession, and meant to house
the lesser creatures that have no shelter unless
the international price code can hold

a few behind its bars? (It's larger, yes,

 




[same stanza]

but no less spare than the other readied cages.)
The teeth-baring lioness as well as the lion

are poised for an attack. Their prey? Why Penn
the child can decide: a chimpanzee that swam

a moat dappled with wished—upon pennies?

a gazelle that hurdled an electrified fence?

Penn checks the package for missing pieces, directions,
anything the least bit instructive—-

a gift shop? an information booth?

Alas, no human kind, no caretakers,

feeders, or visitors have been included,

except for a zebra- or prison—striped train car

packed with children's heads from around the world.

Estrasxlgn

In these disheartening minutes, the many hours

of promised fun that Penn had haplessly

but hopefully imagined for the kids

lapse like an outgrown, selfish wish.

Penn refolds the site plan, a blueprint

for a failed garden and shoves it, animals and all,
in the waste can among a week's discards.

Besides, what do they need with another toy?
Outside his building——among the scolding squirrels,
a cat, a jungle of burlapped nursery stock

the constant rain has kept the super from planting--
Penn feels a slight gladness, surprisingly,

at what he's spared his distant, endangered relations.

 




Pony Penning Day

 

Older ponies recognize the men

and wade the swamps and marshland
to the bay Where the boats are waiting.
Above the surf the crowd

on ChinCOteague can hear the firemen
prodding the ponies to swim,

the rumbling ol‘ their voices cupped

among the oncoming waves.

The channel isn‘t wide; none have drowned
in crossing, though half were lost

once in a squall and stranded along

Virginia, still as wooden toys

standing on their sides or upside down,
the way a boy would leave them,
deciding on a swim. The long poles
push the ponies bobbing up

and down in a earrousel ol‘ w;t"es,
toward the shallows. ()n the shore

they seetn too heavy to swim,

to hold their weight, or ours or hollow.
'l'he herd parades down the road

the tourists line, as though returning

years at sea, islands away l'rom ht me.

All .tl‘tet'noon the ponies

are led on and till the plall‘orm

in a line it seetns years won‘t exhaust.
The t hildren pick out patterns

they like, while the lathers bid on ones
which look easier It) break.

 




Sunday the firemen swim the unsold

across the sound to Assateague

where tiretracks and footprints mark the beach
from Thursday. There the ponies

lie down and kick and roll in the sand:

not happy nor unhappy,

not mourning like Achilleus' horses,

nor like Achilleus himself

drowning his tears in the dust, but soaked
and so must dry their coats,

mortal among mortal men, without

gods to mete their fates, or trust.

Scrub Jays

In this cold, grey day

they burn like blue flame.

Heads cocked to one side

they miss no chance -

pounce and stab and eat any live thing
seed, bug, frog, egg, chick

all gulped down without apology.

People who feed birds hate jays -—

too jumpy and bullying

cute finches and chickadees shoved aside
seeds fly as stout beaks thrash to and fro
grabbing;f6r theaheatiin the sunflower's germ
dead of winter no time for manners.

They don't sing, but yell,

good and loud, to each other;

a laugh it sounds like to me

a strong, intelligent, unafraid

We‘re alive! We're alive!
Heya! Heya!

 




I

He waits for dusk

to begin the slow waddle
through bramble

to street.

Carries seeds of wild grass
tangled in his hair,

and his back streaked

with dew from the field.

He totters across to houses
still with night.
Noses lawns, thick as winter fur,
then rolls to rub the rough
from his coat
and rest against the sweet rump
of summer.

II

I smell him.
Startled to musk,
his odor seeps like a warning

past locked doors

and shut windows.

He comes nights,
pitching my sleep

with dreams of wildness.

I know that field across the street,
have felt the briars

which tear clothes and claw skin

if you move too quickly.

.And that rich clutter of root and Vine

which snarl and snag any path—formed foot.

It's such unyielding disorder——
it's all the sweet heat of life.

 




Slugs

Always the last guests

at the banquet, arriving

from old cisterns and plant-heaps

long after dark,

you mark your trails

neatly, wandering laces of slime

of interest to crickets and house cats.

I watch you, the greatest four inches long,
tigered like flatWOrms or pike,

nose the round bits of potato

into evening‘ s senescence.

I admire your delicate eyestalks,

the fluid contentment of your bodies,
the ways you so back where yOu came from
sayins nothing, gleaming

and muscular as silence.

 




Snow Scene with Two Dogs

 

Warm enough for snow to fall, for us

to fulfill a neglected promise to the dogs

that, oddly, we keep between us, we walk

to a park where opaque white has covered the world
of their concerns, which, blissfully and because

of us, are none——except for the two of us.

There's little we envy in their abandon that skirts
the field (of vision: we can't be out of their sights)
or in the democracy with which they trouble

a field so perfectly primed by the heavy snowfall

that where they slide, what they paw or nose,

is scumbled from matt white into whitish hues,

newish elements in the self-conscious

(I have contributed that) genre scene:

Two Dogs in Snow, with Lost Scarf,

Fallen Sign—~Vacation Bible School--
Arching Brambles——tangled in their coats?--

And Their Patrons——obligatory tributes,

crude likenesses of quilted figures

all but cropped out of the dogs' picture.

And though it's a joy to witness a joy invoked
by walk?, a simple suggestion, it hasn‘t worked

for us. It probably shouldn't. We wouldn't dream

of addressing one another (or the problem,

 




well, somewhere in the field) with shared commands

like speak!, enough already?, understand?,

or, more to the point we've been missing, heali,

an imperative. We're trainable. We’re here--

that's something-~but what's immediate is, we're needed:

the dogs have snow packed tight between their pads.

Sit, we direct them, we can help. And,

with the simplicity of obedience,

we do help, prying from the nerve center
inside each paw, from what might be considered
the palm of the hand, a huge pearl of ice

that's opalescent, almost, as it shines.

What Is enviable, I'll grant them, is how

even this act-~it's only their second snow,
compared to what is our sixth season this fall--
this the dogs redeem into ritual:

as each frozen pearl is freed, they feel

the need to seize it and chew it, wagging their tails

as if the very sources of pain were treats.

Good boys, we say, and then because it's
something to do, we fasten their leashes again.
The chill factor has waxed, the snowfall, waned,

and we recross the field we've muddied toward home.

Since then, I've thought of saying, my pet, let's swallow

whatever it is, but frankly, I'm not able

to find the reward, the moral of the fable.

 




Winter Hummingbird

Winter dawn, the earth still

under a shroud frost.

The mulberry leaves have yellowed and fallen;

bare branches click-clack in the wind like bones.

The birdbath water —-

sea to countless wrigglers and swimmers

rippling surface quickened by the slightest breeze —-
locked now in block of ice hard as rock.

Elena is dying, the breath crushed out of her
by a tumor in her cheSt; ' '

the crab's great claw clamps tighter, tighter
round her heart. 5

There she is, high up in the pines

a flash bf brilliant green, now here, now there,
wings beating quicker than sight,

heart quicker than sound

hovering, swerving, cutting through space

sure as a bullet

she rockets, finally straight up into the sky
(Look at me, anyone brave enough to want me or fight me!)
dives straight back down, fearless,

to alight with a peep and a flutter

on her favorite branch.

She perches a few seconds,

wings aquiver, beak cooked up, defiant and alert,
a weightless, self-consuming blur

of desire and passion and motion

a tiny ingot pulsing with sun-fire.

Hummingbird, be near us in winter!

Hover over us, 0 tiny warm one,

thaw the terrible ice that grips our hearts!

0 lighter than air, fastest of heart and wing,
Quicken our clotted blood,

rid us of this dreadful weight!

Remind us, 0 nectar-sipper,

that life, short life, is sweet.

Actually it’s a decorous cold war

that reign benign- admit it! benightedly!

A lone examplei the day we put the dog

(as we did his collar, leash and bowl)

we are not so easily led from guilt

 




cont. (same stanza) / Poem

to guiltlessness lulled from sleeplessness
to sleep. For what is spirit save a body
absence makes motions the arms adopt
the heat of memory where sorrow warms itself
a voice—-one’s own? that solitude befriends:
our practical refusal to give form up
to entropies like grief. Now expectation
wags its tail at the door heels at the corner
dodges among our feet. The world the dead
inherit like anyone divided from us
is this one: Here and the beyond are waged
under one immortal impassible sky
(What difference if the "i—m" is snipped from each?)
where, every day, we count or is it cut?

our losses, take or is it give? our readings.

 




Feeding Tine, Arbor Farm

In this the quietest place
Frogs stroke love songs at dusk,
The hen soft chucks, the dog
Rustles his bed in turns,

The churn of teeth on corn,
The bay settles to her grain,
The cat blscK against rafters
Stalks swallows in SWOOpS,
Night air buzzes and breat4es
Its soft muzzle close against
My chest, my neck, my ear.

 




 

William Heyen

WITNESS

We’d walked into the small warm shed

where spring lambs lay in Straw

in the half-dark still smelling of their birth,

of ammonia, the damp grass, dung, .

into this world in the middle of a ﬁeld

where lambs bleating soft songs lifted

their too-heavy heads toward their mothers,

gentle presences within their wool clouds.

Later, outside, as I watched,

Wenzel wrapped his left arm around a sheep’s neck
and struck her with the sledge in his right hand.
The dying sheep, her forehead crushed, cried out,
past pain, for her mortal life. Blood ﬂowed

from her burst skull, over her eyes, her black nose.
Wenzel dropped her to the grass.

When I ran home, I struck my head

on a blossoming apple-bough.

Where was the dead sheep?

What did I hear?

Where is the witness now?

I was nine or ten.

Her cry was terror,

so I lay awake to hear her,

to wonder why she didn’t seem to know

- her next manger, her golden ﬁelds.

Her odors drifted through my screen ——
the hay at the roots of her wool,

her urine, the wet graindust under her chin,
her birth ﬂuids hot and ﬂecked with blood.
I could hear her bleat

to her last lamb, hear her heartbeat

in the black air of my room.

Where was the dead sheep?

Why did she cry for her loss?

Where is the witness now?

Not to accept, but to awaken.

Not to understand, to cry terror, but to know

that even a billon years later, now,

we breathe the ﬁrst circle of light,

and the light curves into us, into the deer’s back,

the man’s neck, the woman’s thigh, ‘

the cat’s mouse-mossed tongue, all the ruby

berries ripening in evening air.

The dead elms and chestnuts are of it, and do not

break the curve. The jeweled ﬂies sip it,

and do not break the curve.

Our homes inhabit, and ride the curve.

The mountains, its children, do not break the curve.

Our moon, our rivers, the furthest stars blinking blue,

the great named and nameless comets do not break the curve.
The odorous apple-blossom rain does not break the curve.
The struck ewe’s broken brainpan does not break the curve.
Wenzel nor this witness breaks the curve. _

In the shed’s dusk where spring lambs

sang to their mothers, in my dark room

where the dead ewe’s odors drifted my sleep,

and now, within these cells where her forehead blood
flows once more into recollection,

the light curves. You and I bear witness, and know this,
and as we do the light curves into this knowledge.

The struck ewe lives in this light,

in this curve of the only unbroken light.

Have they not appetites? Do we
plan for slaughter to ﬁll our troughs?

Their fat ones, despised, waddle large-footed,
their thin ones hoard

inedible discs and scraps

called ‘money.’ Us they fatten,

us they exchange for this;

and they breed us not that our life
may be whole, pig-life

thriving alongside dog-life, bird-life,
grass-life, all

the lives of earth-creatures,

but that we may be devoured. Yet,
it’s not being killed for food

hunt one another. But only Humans,

I think, ﬁrst corrupt their prey
as we are corrupted, stuffed with temptation
until we can’t move,

crowded until we turn on each other,

It is their greed

speaks to me in Piggish. She knows
my thoughts, she sees my emotions
ﬂower and fade, fade and ﬂower

as my destiny unrolls

its carpet, its ice and apples.

Not even she

knows all my dreams.
Under the russet sky
at dusk

I have seen

the Great Boar pass

invisible save to me.
His tusks are
ﬂecked with skyfoam.

His eyes
red stars.

GRACE TO BE SAID AT THE SUPERMARKET

That God of ours, the Great Geometer

Does something for us here, where he has put

(If you want to put it that way) things in shape,
Compressing the little lambs in orderly cubes,
Making the roast a decent cylinder,

Fairing the tin, elipsoid of a ham,

Getting the luncheon meat anonymous,

In squares and oblongs with the edges beveled

Or rounded (streamlined maybe, for greater speed).

Praise Him, he has conferred aesthetic distance
Upon our appetites, and on the bloody w.

Mess of our birthright, our unseemly need,
Imposed significant form. Through him the brutes
Enter the pure Euclidean kingdom of numbers.
Free of their bulging and blood-swollen lives
They come to us holy, in celophane
Transparencies, in the mystical body,

That we may look unflinchingly on death
As the greatest good, like the philosopher should.

Howard Nemerov

 




 

 

INTO THE WAR-TORN HAMLET
STRUTS A HARBINGER

From the burnt jungle at dawn
the little cockerel struts,
burnished auburn and indigo feathers

shimmering in the rise of the sun,
a bantam cockerel tailed by his hen,
irridescent, bronze.

They come goose-stepping home
clucking through silent lanes,
shattered huts, the rubble of battle.

In his wake the hen pecks the dust
for invisible crumbs,
finds owl-Q fragments of bone.

They pause by the farthest hut,
stalk the tilt of ladder up to the room
where the last two survivors hide.

The hen hunts through the corners
then, finding a bundle of rags,
stomps them into a nest, lays one egg.

The man seizes it, punctures one end,
offers it to the woman
who swallows the tepid yolk.

From the broken roof
the cockerel crows and crows.
The hen continues to brood the rags.

DEFINITIONS FOR OUR TIME

 

(After reading a letter by David Romtvedt)

MARE

There will be no mare
grazing in this field,
her chestnut flanks
sun bright and

silk under my hand.

PASTURE

No pasture either, with
its stream winding between
maples and aspen.

No russian thiStle'

to comb out of

the mare's tail.

EARTH

The earth may not be able
to support any but the most
rudimentary life forms.

ACCEPTABLE CASUALTIES
IO, 20, or even 60 million dead.

RECOGNITION

It would be impossible

to recognize anything.

The concrete floor of the barn
would be ash.

BIRDS

They will melt
as they fly upward.

MEMORY

There would be no one
to remember the mare
gazing out of the sides
of her luminous eyes.




 

doing least harm

 
 

Every force has its form.

-—Shaker saying

when danger comes

a grizzly bear or a wolf
muskoxen run to form a circle
horns out tails to the inside
their young in the center
then stand their ground

this doesn't work well against guns.

a man watched muskoxen dying

and one day began trapping a herd
calves cows bulls one by one

took them to his fenced—in farm
trained his dogs to keep away
because they looked like wolves

and left the beasts alone

months later walking in that field

he saw come loping over the rise

his youngest dOg before he could yell
the oxen stamped into a ring

horns outside low to the ground
their rumps together

with him inside

MILKING MORNING

Comes the morning, dark and cold
and quiet as a granite cave
and I rise unwilling

to begin my day.

I rise and don my overalls.
I lace my boots and tend the fire,
stir it to life,
make it rise and clothe itself.
I wrap my scarf and coat around me
and step into the freezing wind stirring
like a restless stream
along the banks of house and trees
and barn
wherein ~
the sleeping cattle lie, their udders full
of milk--aching udders of transposed hay--
this small miracle happens every day.

I go there every morning,

every dark-beginning day,
feeling dismal and reluctant to pursue
this kind of life,
until I see them and they see me and they rise to greet
me (or so it seems they rise to greet me) all my
charges, my young ladies,
the supporters of my dreams.
What they give me has no measure,
cannot be counted, has no score, but can be, perhaps,
near drawn in an image that I see:

I kneel
and watch my hands, white and wrinkled, cracked by cold,
wash the first cow, watch the teats swell with newly
let-down milk,
and in that simple union between a beast and me a kind
of beast, I'm aware of unsold peace and the sun come
soft as silk-dust settling lightly on the panes, warming
the edges of hoarfrost there and the misty breath of
cow-ripe air; and my own sluggish heart it sets to
pounding--pounding with the joy of being--

filling me

filling me

with itself filling

me
through my lungs through my veins through my soul

filling me
with mild lightning.

THE ONLY COWS LEFT IN PISCATAWAY

The only cows left in Piscataway
chew grass by the split-rail fence,
and fix their mild eyes on the horizon

where petroleum tanks squat.

The only cows left in Piscataway
breathe black smoke

settling on the pasture

like fog on a gray morning,

hang their heads over the fence
and fix mild eyes on trucks

spewing their way uphill.

The only cows left in Piscataway
eat grass in a field fertilized
by exhaust, and the farmer

wipes soot from their faces

before he milks them.

TWO HORSES

The horses Jack and Racket have gone down
into the Elysian ﬁelds.

It" is a world without fences.

The creeks never run dry

But splash and bubble over stones rubbed
Bright as silver.
Jack and Racket
Bend their long necks down
And, drinking, become young again.

Their bones vanish back inside the good shapes
Of Shire and Appaloosa.

Of course, life isn’t like this.

Life is two graves big as cellar holes
At the foot of the north meadow,
Covered with stones.

Which is why, this morning,

I wind around my ﬁngers a few
Long hairs caught in the gate latch
And inhale their salty fragrance,

And why I imagine in a far pasture two dappled
Giants lipping lazily
Apples as they fall from the everbearing trees.

The Seed-Eaters

The seed-eaters, the vegetarian birds,

Redpolls, grosbeaks, crossbills, ﬁnches, siskins,
Fly south to winter in our north, so maklng
A sort of Florida of our best blizzards.

Weed seeds and seeds of pine cones are their pillage,
Alder and birch catkins, such vegetable

Odds and ends as the winged keys of maple

As well as roadside sumac, red-plush-seeded.

Hi! with a bounce in snowﬂake ﬂocks come juncos
As if a hand had ﬂipped them and tree sparrows,
Now nip and tuck and playing tag, now squatting
All weather-proofed and feather-ﬂuffed on snow.

Hard fare, full feast, I’ll say, deep cold, high spirits.
Here’s Christmas to Candlemas on a bunting’s budget.
From this old seed-eater with his beans, his soybeans,

Cracked corn, cracked wheat, peanuts and split peas, hail!

Cold

Cold and t colors of cold: mineral, shell,
ue. The sky is on ﬁre with blue

   
 

And the absolutes of inte tellar sky.

Boy Riding Forward Backward

P -sto, pronto! Two boys, two horses.
Bu the boy on backward riding forward
Is t‘.- boy to watch.

He rioes the forward horse and laughs
In the . ce of the forward boy on the backward
Horse, .nd he laughs

Back an. the horses laugh. They gallop.
The trick 's the cool barefaced pretense
There is n trick.

They might ue ﬂying, face to face,
On a fast tra n. They might be whitecaps
Hot-cool-head - . ,

One curling ba ward, one curving forward,
Racing a rivalry f waves.
They might, they 'ght—

Across a blue of lak. through trees,
And half a mile away caught them:
Two boys, two horses.

Through trees and throu binoculars
Sweeping for birds. Oh, th were birds
All right, all right,

Swallows that weave and wa - and sweep
And skim and swoop and skit-r until
The last trees take them.

    
 
  

Abstract, impersonal, metaphy ' al, pure,
This dazzling art derides me. Ho should warm breath
Dare to exist? Exist, exult, endure.

The Chipmunks Day ,

In and out the bushes, up the ivy,

Into the hole

By the old oak stump, the chipmunk ﬂashes.
Up the pole

To the feeder full of seeds he dashes,
Stuffs his cheeks,

The Chickadee and titmouse scold him.
Down he streaks.

Red as the leaves the wind blows off the maple,
Red as a fox,

Striped like a skunk, the Chipmunk whistles
Past the love seat, past the mailbox,

Down the path,

Home to his warm hole stuffed with sweet
Things to eat.

Neat and slight and shining, his front feet

Curled at his breast, he sits there while the sun
Stripes the red west

\Vith its last light: the Chipmunk

Dives to his rest.

The Earth Worm

The worm artist
out of soil, by passage
of himself
constructing.
Castles of metaphor!
Delicate
dungeon turrets!
He throws 0H
artifacts as he
contracts and expands the
muscle of his being,
ringed in himself,
tilling. He
is homage to
earth, aerates

the ground of his living.

TO THE SNAKE

Green Snake, when I hung you round my neck
and stroked your cold, pulsing throat
as you hissed to me, glinting
arrowy gold scales, and I felt
the weight of you on my shoulders,
and the whispering silver of your dryness
sounded close at my ears——

Green Snake—I swore to my companions that certainly
you were harmless! But truly
I had no certainty, and no hope, only desiring
to hold you, for that joy,
which left
a long wake of pleasure, as the leaves moved
and you faded into the pattern
of grass and shadows, and I returned
smiling and haunted, to a dark morning.

Evening Dance of the Grey Flies

For Chris

Grey ﬂies, fragile, slender-winged and slender-legged
scribble a pencilled script across the sunlit lawn.

As grass and leaves grow black
the grey ﬂies gleam— .
their cursive ﬂight a gold calligraphy.

It is the light that gilds their frail

bodies, makes them fat and bright as bees——
reﬂected or refracted light—

as once my ﬂst

A Family Tree

 

The night they sprayed the roost you were just ﬁve,
supposed to be asleep and the lawn empty

before you woke for school. I planned to lie,

how they ﬂew someplace larger than our elm tree—
like every dog that ran away over

the outerbelt, all to some good family.

It was too dark to tell branches from birds:

the hose struck anywhere. Outlined in foam

a single starling, tree-size, white, appeared.

It wasn’t hard to shape the wings from shadows,

to call the quarter moon a beak, up-turned.

The branches disappeared the way warm snow
drOps, whole boughs at once. Huddled, undisturbed
the birds just ﬂoated, and when the foam .seeped in,
they disappeared. We waited for the birds to drop
with the temperature, to hit the freezing point—
we: sprayed again, the weather would decide.

A morning free of frost, the early Dispatch

counted fifty-one, which left the same thousands,
our same small ﬂock you always fed your crusts.
You were not asleep though: watching inside

the screen door, a robe beneath your coat;
watching those next days, how the birds fell limp,
(I always imagined) along the streets you crossed
coming from school. I saw their ﬂapping limbs
scooped inside your lunchbox, delivered home
each afternoon like more permission slips,

all asking me: cure them, splint each bone,

provide them shelter until they’re airborne,

then set them free. I say it will be all right

as though performing those simple labors

lifted the curse of starlings from our homes.

Notes Through the Winter

 

November 6, 1861

Dear Theresa,
What news but more of the same? Albert owns
three dozen cages now—and you ask what my day is like?
Can there be metaphors among such likeness? It is noon
or midnight, then, the ostinato of cuckoo-clock
that hoards the hour and will not let it pass. Outside it snows!
but here, the one song is Spring, arriving and arriving:
all the songs are harbingers of n0thing more than more song.

What is new, is my lack of forebearance. There was a scene
at supper, and for no reason, unless it was to lie
awake and think of one. Now it’s midnight. As I write you
I hear them singing—it is my one continuous dream.
Mine, alone! Father cannot sleep for all his plans to sell,
Albert tends the brood, a mother bird himself (forgive me!),
and Mother folds her words with muslin in her reticule.

The conversation never strays from birds, it is grace
we say at every meal, the tea that steeps all afternoon.
Albert says, he insists, birds have no feeling in their eyes-—
no feelings. He quoted Scripture: how Creation is ours
to finish, inferring a votive charge; that in God’s eyes
we may blind God’s creatures. I asked why they sing past dark.
Father told how the songbox opens with a key of light,
how it locks again at dusk, and how they throw away the key.
Yet I persisted, asked why is it not forever locked,
and Albert, in tones I need not familiarize you with,
pronounced, “You’re not silent, Dear, though you lock
yourself upstairs.”
Theresa, either I have lost all logic in this din,

TURTLES

A friend told this story about snapping turtles:

One lived in the lake below his house.

He saw it sometimes, lumbering through the shallows,
Hunting, morosely, for something to eat.

A year later

He found a second turtle on a highway.

He brought it home and watched it

Crawl down the lawn. Unblinking, it entered the water.

3

Next morning: a splashing on the far shore.

He ran for his ﬁeld-glasses and looked:

In the ripples the two turtles were playing,
Mouthing and nuzzling, rolling over in the mud,
Their dank limbs hugging,

Like two bears honey-drunk, except

These were not bears but the thick reptile: turtle.

24

 

. "19: hi?"- 9!

.0155 ga- mu 231.5.

 

 

Later .
They swam away, and the surface of the water
Closed above them, shaking like ﬁre.

I eat no meat.

I break no leaf in idleness.

I listen to the rocks breathing
In the wet meadows.

6
When I heard this story, I said:
The dead have no eyes.
The dead can cherish nothing

But their own white bones.
That is what being dead is.

7

But there is a way, one,
To live forever.
