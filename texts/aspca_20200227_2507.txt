founded the ASPCA and pushed through
this country’s first anti-cruelty law. These
countries are now beneﬁtting from our hun-
dred years of experience in animal welfare
work.

Japan, for instance, has no anti-cruelty
law. In an effort to introduce in the Diet a
bill making cruelty to animals a legal offense,
the Japan Animal Welfare Society requested
copies of our laws to use as a model. Two
representatives of the Japan society inspected
our hospital and Manhattan shelter with a
view to incorporating some of our ideas in
expanding their shelter facilities.

Calcutta requested information on our
activities to help enlighten the Indian people.
Portugal asked for photographs and literature
for a television campaign to teach proper
care of animals.

The Chief veterinarian of the Israel hu-
mane society visited our hospital and took
back a great deal of up-to-date veterinary
information. Nigeria asked for films, posters
and samples of our literature.

Four boys were ordered by a Minnesota
juvenile court to buy a puppy and care for
the animal, at their own expense, for at least
a year. The ususual order was directed at a
quartet which poured gasoline or kerosene
on a dog and then set the canine on ﬁre. The
dog was severely burned, but survived.

The judge warned the boys that any abuse
of the animal would be considered a probation
violation, and told the boys’ parents they
must report any mistreatment of the dog. The
animal will be examined every three months,
and his condition will be reported to the
court

We heartily commend the judge’s wise
decision. Children who own pets seldom
abuse them. Youngsters deprived of the
companionship of a ﬂuffy four-footed friend
are more apt to mistreat an animal because
they don’t know the joy a pet can bring. A
pet can ,teach children how wonderful and
fragile a life is— whether a human’s life or
an animal’s life.

“Next, we couldn’t let the dog roam free
on the mainland. I couldn’t abide keeping
an animal always penned up, and if TeePee
should slip his leash and suck an egg or
mangle a chicken, the natives would hunt
him down and kill him.

“Furthermore, TeePee could easily swim
to the mainland if he wanted to.”

Winslow sums up his case, “I have taken a
strange, frightened, wild animal and made
a pet and a friend of him. Back in civilization
he’d never make it. He’s happy the way
things are, and so am I. It’s quiet and com-
fortable on that island. TeePee and I have a
lot in common over there. Maybe he has too
i much sense to swim back.”

To Winslow it hardly seems that six years
have passed since the mournful howl from
Green Island ﬁrst reached his ears. To many,
including some family friends, these have
been years in which the welfare of an animal
has seemed at times completely out of pro-
portion. Others, however, know them as years
of slow, warm development: development of
a strange but staunch companionship between
a kindly man, wise in the ways of animals,
and a dog: a wild dog, a killer dog—some
folks say.

Wild, yes! Killer, maybe! Back in 1957,
that is. But this is 1963, and half a thousand

and more pilgrimages to Green Island are

behind the man who sits on his terrace with
his wife, his setter, his dachshund and his
recollections. Yes, and also with the Medal
of Honor of The American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Blessings
on Kenelm Rogers Winslow!

MAGINE the world minus the Panama

Canal . . . the United States populated by
180 million vegetarians . . . and sleek 1963
automobiles bumping along the nation’s high-
ways on steel tires.

This might be true today but for, of all
people, the veterinarian. Ever since the ﬁrst
cave child cared for a bird with a broken
wing thousands of years ago, history is
studded with the remarkable contributions
veterinarians have made toward the health
and comfort of man, as well as animals.

The Panama Canal, for instance, might
never have been built if yellow fever hadn’t
been wiped out. Mosquitoes were pegged as
the carriers of yellow fever after veterinarians
pinned the blame for Texas fever, a cattle
disease, on a tick, which carried the fever-
causing organism. This was the ﬁrst time a
parasite was incriminated as the cause of a
disease, and the discovery gave scientists the
idea that a parasite might be causing yellow
fever in man.

Saved the cattle industry

We might all be vegetarians, if veteri-
narians hadn’t eradicated Texas fever and
pleuro-pneumonia, which almost destroyed
the U. S. cattle industry. They also found a
way of controlling hog cholera, which once
threatened to ruin our swine industry.

We owe the swift and luxurious comfort
of today’s automobiles to a nineteenth century
veterinarian, who, between doctoring ailing
horses and cows, took the jars out of travel
by inventing the pneumatic tire.

Dr. John Boyd Dunlop, a successful Scot-
tish veterinarian practicing in Ireland, got
tired of bouncing around Belfast’s cobble-
stone streets in his horse-drawn buggy with
its steel wheels. When his ten-year-old son
Johnny got a bicycle he grabbed it for an
experiment. He made a rubber tube out of
sheet rubber and canvas and pumped it full
of air with Johnny’s football pump. He put
the tire on the bicycle and sent the boy out
to test the invention. This tire, on exhibit

O N EASTER SUNDAY millions of people
will attributte to the rabbit a feat they
know to be impossible all year round. Ever
since a Teutonic legend spread the word that
the rabbit was once a bird transformed into
its present shape by Ostara, goddess of spring,
the story is maintained that the rabbit lays
eggs in her honor every April. Rabbits and
eggs are now as deeply entrenched in the
celebration of Easter (the word is derived
from Ostara) as Santa Claus is in Christmas.

But this curious egg-laying superstition
isn’t half as amazing as some other legends
about the peace-loving bundle of fur variously
known as a rabbit, hare, pika, bunny or
cony. The South American Indian revered
the great hare as the original creator of the
universe. Instead of a man in the moon,
devout Hindus see the outline of a hare, and
old Sanskrit fables tell of a bare that lived
on the moon and was king of all earthly hares.
Some European peasants hold that the bare
was once the spirit of corn, and the last sheaf
of corn reaped at harvest is shaped into the
form of a bare and used in rituals. Many
people think it unlucky if a hare (not neces-
sarily black) crosses their path.

Family tree

Legendary rabbits notwithstanding, the
real-life rabbit leads an unkinglike, unspirit-
like, but hare-raising existence, sometimes
tinged with magical touches. The big-earred,
long-legged animal, which traces his ancestors
back some 30 million years, makes his home
in all four corners of the world, except Mada-
gascar.

It is believed the hippity-hopper was ﬁrst
domesticated on the Iberian peninsula. As
far back as the beginning of the Christian
era Spanish galleons carried cargoes of them
to Roman markets. The Romans probably in-
troduced them into England. Besides scores
of wild varieties, there are now about ten
domesticated varieties, including Belgian,
Dutch, Angora, Himalayan, Siberian, Flem-
ish, Chinchilla and New Zealand.

Australia had no rabbits until 1859, when
24 European rabbits set free multiplied so

10

 

SPLITTING
HARES

rapidly that today the rabbit population
threatens to nibble the Australian plains bare.
Foxes were brought in to check the rabbit
plague, but they became a plague themselves.

So adaptable is the animal that the world’s
wild rabbits range in size from the six-inch
Idaho pygmy to the nine pound Arctic hare;
they wear fur coats varying from the Arctic
hare’s snow white to the South African red
hare’s colorful coat; they’re at home in
timbered rock piles near the summit of bleak
mountain ranges in the Urals, in underground
burrows on United States plains, in South
African forest thickets, or on the Scottish
moors. The Arctic hare lives in snow-sheeted,
treeless wastes bordering the ice cap, his bed
out on the open windswept wastes. The

Mexican pygmy lives only on the Mexican
volcanoes Popocatepetl and Iztaccihuatl, at
altitudes of 10,000 to 12,000 feet.

Rabbit or hare

Although they’re brothers under the skin,
there are some differences between the rabbit
and the bare. Big brother hare is larger, has
bigger ears and a longer tail. He lives on the
surface of the ground, while brother rabbit
lives under it. The major difference is that
rabbit babies are born naked and sightless,
while the hare’s young have their eyes wide
open, are fully clothed in soft, warm fur and
are active at birth. Nevertheless, Americans
call them both rabbits, and Europeans lump
them together under hares.

Social life

Rabbits stick together like teen-agers at
the corner soda fountain. Hundreds live to-
gether in underground communal burrows,
or warrens, connected by well-worn runways
to the feeding grounds. Before the babies are
born a doe digs a separate nursery in the
ground away from the noise and clatter.

White-tailed jack rabbits even hold com-
munity dances. On moonlight nights in mid-
winter, when unseasonably warm weather has
melted the snow, ten or twelve of the clan
gather in a great circle that gradually gets
smaller as they close in. Suddenly they
bounce in the air and disappear in all di-
rections. In a few minutes another circle
forms and vanishes again the same way.

Mating season is the high point of the
social calendar. After a winter of friendly
relationships, the males begin to snap angrily
at each other. Come spring they lose their
normally peace-loving dispositions and often
rip each other’s throats with teeth and claws
while vying for their lady loves. Some males
even stand on their hind legs and box each
other furiously. Jack rabbits are famous for
their combat scars, and the expression “mad
as a March hare” owes its origin to the
seemingly senseless behavior of the European
hare battling for a doe.

Mother love

The mother jack rabbit (really a bare) has
her young, sometimes as many as eight, in
a scraped-out depression lined with fur, under
an overhanging bush or tall grass. Their eyes
are wide open, and in ﬁve minutes they’re
ready to nurse. When mother leaves her
babies, she hides them under the grass and
fur of the nest. She sneaks back only to nurse
them, and then only under cover of darkness.
In a few days they’re out playing tag. They
strike out on their own in three or four
weeks, and mother is ready for a new family.

The normally timid cottontail mother can
burn with hot fury when a snake threatens
her brood. She opens her attack with marvel-
ous strategy and courage. Her offensive is so

Early veterinary history

Man has been practicing the healing art
on animals ever since he ﬁrst domesticated
them for his food supply and to carry his
burdens long before the dawn of civilization.
The word “veterinarian” itself comes from
the Latin word that means beast of burden.
The oldest known medical writing is the
Veterinary Papyri of Phaun, dating back to
1900 BC. Archeologists dug it up in Egypt,
where the ancients were highly organized
farmers depending heavily on domestic ani-
mals. Some 4,000 years ago a great Babylo-
nian king, Hammurabi, developed a code
for the practice of human and animal medi-
Ecine, spelling out the obligations a doctor
owed to the society he served.

Under the Greeks veterinary medicine
reached new heights along with astronomy,
physics, mathematics and other natural sci-
ences, and a school at Alexandria was an
outstanding center of veterinary teaching.
ltinerant animal doctors traveled throughout
the land treating sick domestic animals and
ministering to the horses used by royalty
during war.

Hippocrates, the father of modern medi-
cine, compared sickness in animals and man,
and Aristotle classiﬁed animals according to
their structure and wrote a treatise on animal
medicine.

The Roman legions, hamstrung without
their cavalry and transport horses, took
veterinarians on their far-ﬂung conquest
marches. One of the earliest records of meat
inspection is chiseled on the facade of a
Roman building in England. lmbedded in
the stone is the name of the veterinarian in
charge of the slaughter houses where im-
perial troops got their meat.

Absyrtus of Constantinople, a fourth cen-
tury army ofﬁcer who taught veterinary
medicine to cavalry ofﬁcers and accurately
described many equine diseases, is considered
by some historians to be the father of vet-
erinary medicine. Others give this accolade

6

to Vegetius Renatus, who wrote the ﬁrst
systematic book on animal diseases.

Around 600 A.D. skilled Arab horsemen
swept through Spain, Syria, Arabia, Persia
and across all North Africa, spreading vet-
erinary learning, especially concerning the
horse, throughout the Arabian Empire. Many
drugs administered by the Arabs are still in
use today.

The first school

Modern veterinary medicine started with
the ﬁrst veterinary school, established in
France in 1761 by a decree of Louis XV. Al-
most every country in Europe sent students
to the Lyon school and ﬁve years later a
second school was founded at Alfort, just
outside Paris. Graduates took knowledge
back to their homelands and by the end of
the eighteenth century veterinary schools
had mushroomed in every principal nation
in Europe.

A horse named Eclipse is credited with
spurring veterinary education in England.
This proliﬁc and unruly steed was born dur-
ing a lunar eclipse of 1764. His name was
apropos, for the gangly, big-boned thorough-
bred racer eclipsed all his contemporaries,
was never defeated and became the greatest
idol of the English turf.

When Eclipse died of a violent colic seizure
at the age of 25, shocked English nobility,
sportsmen and rich cattle owners determined
to end the treatment-of-race-horses-by-stable-
hands era. England’s ﬁrst veterinary school
opened two years later in a London suburb
with a hospital of 50 stalls and 20 students.
To commemorate his contribution to science
Eclipse’s skeleton was preserved and is on
exhibit today in the Natural Museum in
South Kensington.

In America

Graduates of the London school began to
trickle across the Atlantic to the new world
along with Scottish immigrants around 1800.
The Boston Veterinary Institute, organized
in 1854, was the ﬁrst school of its kind in the
United States to turn out a graduating class.




 

 

 

 

 

 

quick even a large snake will high tail it and
run to avoid being ripped to ribbons by
claws and teeth.

Aggressive only when mating or protecting
young, the rabbit has a couple of clever
defenses up his sleeve. His coat, whether the
white of the Arctic hare, or the silvery gray
of the woolly Himalayan hare, melts into the
background, making him almost invisible.

One rabbit, the white-sided jack rabbit,
can even change his coat at will. His brown
fur is broken by a big whitish patch low
down on either side of his body. By contract-
ing his skin muscles he can shift the white
area around. Even when tearing up the pea
patch at break neck speed he can transfer
the brown from the back to one side or the
other and replace it with the white side fur.
When an enemy zeroes in, the white patch
is always pulled to the side facing the in-
truder. As the rabbit zigzags on its course
the coat switches from side to side.

Speed is another escape hatch. Rabbits can
lope along at an easy gait of 35 miles an
hour, and at 45 leave their enemies biting the
dust. The white-tailed jack rabbit, one of the
Heetest animals on the western plains, chalks
up an Olympic twelve feet in one easy run-
ning hop, and under pressure can stretch
the leap to 18 or 20 feet.

Enemies

Still, a rabbit seldom dies of old age. Many
wild cats, foxes, coyotes, weasels, raccoons,
hawks and eagles take a large annual toll.
And he has another formidable enemy——
man. American hunters kill over 20 million
cottontails a year. The animal’s voracious
appetite for lettuce and alfalfa makes him a
scourge of the farmer, who hunts him down
relentlessly. One Oregon county alone paid
bounties for a million rabbits in a single year.

In 1951 Australia hoped to rid itself of its
rabbit problem with a virus deadly only to
rabbits. The plan was to inoculate some rab-
bits with it and release them to infect their
kin. But the idea backﬁred when the disease
spread to Europe, killing millions of rabbits.

12

Rabbits as big business

Not everybody regards the rabbit as a
nuisance. The lowly creature is the mainstay
of a couple of big industries. Masquerading
as its more expensive cousins, the minks,
sables and chinchillas, rabbit fur graces
milady in coats, jackets, scarves, hats and
dresses. Felt hats are made from rabbit pelts.

Europeans eat rabbit meat as a delicacy,
and many tons of the meat are consumed
annually in England alone. Ever since the
Norman conquest the English have protected
the rabbit as game. A comparatively new
rabbit career is producing wool. Angoras
grow wool ﬁve to eight inches long, and one
rabbit can yield twelve ounces a year, which
works up into a highly fashionable sweater.

Rabbits are valuable to man in still another
way. They’re used in research projects in
bacteriology and physiology; in nutrition
and hormone studies; in clinical laboratories;
and for producing biologics.

Not the least of the rabbits charms is the
way he has enriched our literature. Just one
hundred years ago Lewis Carroll sent Alice
down a rabbit hole and came up with the
splendidly dressed, white-gloved, ultra-digni-
ﬁed White Rabbit. Carroll painted a totally
different portrait in Alice’s grouchy tea party
partner, the March Hare.

Just about the time British children were
getting to know the White Rabbit, American
children were beginning to read about Brer
Rabbit, Joel Chandler Harris’ mischievous
hero, whose main appeal was the ingenuity
he used to outwit the bear, the fox and the
wolf. The star-studded cast of rabbit folklore
includes the children’s favorites, Peter Cotton-
tail. Peter Rabbit, Aesop’s ﬂeet-footed, but
slow-witted hare, who lost an embarrassing
race to a plodding tortoise, and latest in the
parade, cartoon character Bugs Bunny.

After 30 million years on earth the rabbit
has invaded our menu, our wardrobe, our
folklore, our literature and our cabbage patch.
If he continues to breed as prolifically as in
the past, there is no danger of his being
“hare” today and gone tomorrow.

 




 

 

 

 

 

For the prevention
of cruelty

ASPCA veterinarians worked hard to
save a ten-year-old collie that had been badly
burned over almost her whole body. They
covered her with salve and shot her full of
penicillin. She rallied for a while, but then
grew worse. The three doctors attending her
declared there was no hope. She was merci-
fully put to sleep.

Two patrolmen cruising in a radio car at
4 a.m. had seen the owner pour benzine over
the dog’s back and light it. They jumped out
of the car and put out the ﬁre with a blanket.
They called the ASPCA and took the woman
to the station. She became hysterical and was
taken to Bellevue. As this is written she is
still under psychiatric observation.

On a tip from a neighbor an ASPCA
agent found a starving dog tied up in a Staten
Island back yard. The dog was so weak it
couldn’t walk. The agent immediately drove
the animal to the Staten Island shelter,
where he hoped to feed it. When he put the
animal on the floor it just lay down and
died. In court the judge sentenced the owner
to 90 days in jail or a $50 ﬁne. He warned

her never to own a pet again.

In another case a woman who abandoned

a cat was ﬁned $50.

An ASPCA agent found two dogs tied to
the same pole, one on a one-foot chain, the
other on a two-foot chain. The owner, a
woman, threatened to beat the agent up when
he tried to give her a summons. At the police
station she was so abusive she had to be
handcuffed to a chair. In court she berated
the judge. Nevertheless, the charge of cruelty
to animals lodged against her was dismissed.

Mouth-to-mouth breathing
saves animals’ lives

Dense smoke swirled around his head and
flames licked at his heels as a New York
City ﬁreman leaned over the lifeless form of
a kitten he had just found in a bedroom of a
burning building. He cupped his hands
around the kitten’s head and began breath-
ing into the kitten’s mouth and nose. Then
he massaged the kitten’s heart. Within
minutes there was a faint flutter of life, the
four-day-old kitten gulped a breath of air
and began breathing again.

The ﬁreman, well trained in mouth-to-
mouth breathing for humans, had used the
oldest known means of artiﬁcial respiration.
Rescue breathing, mentioned in the Bible,
was used many years ago to resuscitate per-
sons who had stopped breathing. Later it
was replaced by the prone method.

But several years ago the Red Cross re-
verted to the old method and ofﬁcially adopted
rescue breathing as the method for reviving
victims of drowning or asphyxiation.

And the method works with animals, too.
Veterinarians in the operating room often
resort to mouth to mouth breathing when an
animal patient suddenly stops breathing.
Even if a mechanical resuscitator is on hand,
it may take too long to get a tube into the
animal’s mouth. The veterinarian will cup
his hands around the animal’s face and
breath into its nose and mouth.

There has even been a case of mouth-to-
beak resuscitation. A Pretoria, South Africa
traffic policeman is reported to have used
rescue breathing to save his pet goose.

Pietie, one of the ofﬁcer’s six geese was the
near-victim of a severe rainstorm. When the
policeman went to check the pen he found
Pietie limp and seemingly dead. Remember-
ing his ﬁrst-aid training, the man cleared the
mud and water out of the goose’s nostrils,
put his beak into his own mouth and started
breathing into his lungs. “In a couple of
minutes,” the policeman reported, “he gave
a big sigh and came alive.”




 

 

 

The Wild Dog of Antigua
(Continued from page 3)

to trees in the bush so they can’t swim back.
Sooner or later they howl no more.

“Tomorrow,” Winslow stretched himself
to his full five-eight, “I’m going over to find
out.”

Next morning the house guests, an officer
of the ASPCA and his wife, flew home to
New York and didn’t hear the second chapter
of the story until the postman brought a
letter from Teddy Winslow several weeks
later.

“My Kenelm,” she wrote, “is daubed all
over with gentian violet. He and our house-
lioy have hacked their way with cutlasses to
the crest of Green Island. They’ve been look-
ing for that poor creature ever since you
left. Ken’s sure it’s a dog. It howls every
night. He took the setter the other day, but
the cactus was too much for our civilized
canine.”

VER the months the great search went
on.

“One thing’s sure,” Ken said. “Whatever
it is, it’s loose. Those howls come from differ-
ent places. And it must be getting food and
water.”

In October the Winslows came to New
York for their annual two months stateside.
“It’s a dog,” Ken said triumphantly. “We’ve
finally found his footprints on the picnic
beach at Ten Pound Bay.” He had christened
the elusive stranger TeePee from the initials

of Ten Pound.

Early in 1958, about a year after Winslow
first heard the how], he began leaving dog
food fortiﬁed with vitamins in a red plastic
bowl on the beach. The next time over the
food would be gone and sometimes he found
the bowl under the poisonous manchineel
trees fringing the beach. Plenty of dog
tracks, but still no dog!

“Once or twice I’d swear I saw a flash
of color moving high on the cliffside or may-
be down in the bush. Obstinate son of a

20

gun,” Winslow grumbled in one of his in-
frequent letters.

RIVING from the Winslow house to

Nonesuch Harbor dock and steering an
outboard motor around Antigua through a
choppy, shoal-spotted channel to Green Island
is fun on a calm day with a picnic in prospect.
But thrice-weekly pilgrimages, fighting what-
ever the elements threaten, sometimes take
the seamanship of a dolphin, the obstinacy
of a mule, and usually more of the muscular
attributes than remain to one whose fiftieth
college reunion has come and gone. Gray-
haired, soft-spoken, but no-nonsense Winslow
normally snorts at restraint, and in this case
points rather to these excursions as though
they might be a welcome relief from the
sometimes frenetic atmosphere of one of the
more aristocratic winter vacation spots in the
wide Caribbean.

Son of a Wisconsin surgeon, he’s a do-it-
yourself gentleman electrician, plumber,
cabinetmaker and outboard motor sparker.
He and Teddy were pioneers at the Mill Reef
Club when he retired to Antigua in 1950
from a rough, demanding newspaper man-
agement life in New York. Theirs was the
third clubmember home built 23 miles out
in the bush and sugar cane country with
no telephone system save a crochety one-line
rig going through the substation between
Mill Reef and the capital town of Saint Johns.

Starward, the Winslow home, came to be
Mill Reef trouble-shooting headquarters.
There’s no active humane society on Antigua,
but everyone seems to know where to turn
when there’s an animal problem. Winslow
is his own humane society. Once when a
baby goat fell into a power generator tank
and became coated with oil and filth, natives
ran to Winslow for help. He took the orphan
goat home in his car, cleaned it up, named it
Kilowatt, and made it an acceptable family
pet that romped and played with the dogs as
though it were one of them— until one day
it butted Teddy down the stairs.

How
do you

feelabout

cats?

Ever get the urge to scratch a kitty behind
the ears? Don’t hold back. Cats have been
objects of affection for centuries. They’re even

more popular today.

In ancient Egypt they were worshipped as
goddesses. Norsemen, too, kowtowed to kitty
as Freyja, the cat diety (for whom Friday
was named).

The two-dollar word for cat lovers is “ailur-
ophiles.” History is rife with them~—Cleo—
patra. Mohammed. Martin Luther, Vietor
Hugo, Cardinal W’olsey. Ernest Hemingway
was devoted to cats, and for years Winston
Churchill’s ﬁreside companion was a black
torn named Nelson.

The cat’s independent nature and love of
liberty has endeared it to such men as Thomas
Jefferson, George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln. In Switzerland, the cat is a symbol
of liberty. On the other hand, tyrants feel
uneasy in the presence of a proud feline.

Not only do cats enjoy world-Wide popu-
larity, but the word “cat” is phonetically
similar in many languages. In French. it’s
chat; in Spanish, gato; in German, katze;

24

in. Italian, gallo; in Greek, katus; and in
Arabic, kit.

In addition to being respected and revered
in. history throughout the world, the cat’s
popularity today is on the increase. Nobody
is sure of the precise cat population in the
United States, but authorities at the Purina
Cat Care Center, St. Louis, estimate there
are now 26 million cats —— about one million
more than dogs. Many people believe these
(rats are mainly owned by spinsters and old
ladies but a new study by the Center reveals
that children. are present in 70 percent of
all cat owning families.

Pet dealers report that more men buy cats
than women do ——- probably because cats (un-
like dogs) never have to be taken out for
midnight walks ~—~ usually a man’s chore.

Aside from the practical purposes of keep-
ing a cat, persons share their homes with
felines for a variety of reasons. Psychologists
generalize that dog owning is ego building,
while the cat’s independence and self-sufﬁ-
ciency tend to make their owners a bit more

humble and thoughtful.

EDITORIAL

Dumping an unwanted family pet is a crime
against the pet, a threat to wildlife and a
menace to motorists.

The Nebraska Game, F orestation and
Parks Commission reports the story of a
small White dog, probably once some little
boy’s pet. Now he’s a wild animal, living in
a cave, left by some thoughtless owner to
shift for himself.

A game ofﬁcer ﬁrst spotted the dog some
months ago, but has not been able to get
near the little animal. Once an affectionate
playmate, the furry canine is now a costly
killer. He and others like him add up to a
dog pack that can be even more destructive
than a wolf pack. A free-running dog kills
for food— and just as often for fun.

The damage to wildlife can be consider-
able. Often deer are victims. Most affected
are does in the spring, slow-moving and easily
caught because they are carrying young.

Wildlife aren’t the only victims, however,
Barnyard animals—pigs, chickens, calves,
sheep—also are claimed. Many times coy-
otes, foxes and hawks are blamed for the
killing done by a pack of free runners. The
abandoned dogs themselves are victims of
the thoughtless owners who left them to the
wild. Often they meet their end slowly and
painfully, their ﬂesh ﬁlled with a farmer’s
birdshot or their feet crushed in an animal
trap.

Abandoning a dog in a big city like New
York is equally cruel. Tipping over garbage
cans in a rat race to stay alive is hardly the
sort of future an owner would intentionally
plan for his pet. Yet that’s precisely the
picture facing a dog abandoned to the streets.

Individuals Who dump their dogs because
they “love them too much to put them away”
are simply fooling themselves. Such people
simply love themselves too much to do the
unpleasant job of having the dog put away.

But until the Civil War and the founding of
the American Veterinary Medical Association
in 1863, veterinary medicine in the United
States remained mostly in the hands of
horse shoers, who were delighted to be called
“horse doctors.”

By 1890 the horse was the supreme symbol
of power in America. The age was marked
by millions of draft horses with huge muscles,
teams of sweating farm animals, horse-drawn
streetcars and ﬁre engines, livery stables,
hitching posts, horse hospitals and black-
smith shops. Even the veterinary profession,
by then well established and with several
successful veterinary schools in operation,
centered around the horse.

Then suddenly at the turn of the century
the bottom of the buggy seemed to fall out
and every veterinarian expected to be thrown
out of work by, of all things, the bicycle.
“Has the bicycle come to stay?” was the
burning question of the hour in veterinary
circles. And if the profession survived bicy-
cles, certainly there would be no escape from
what one writer of the day called “the
threat from the motor cycle and horseless
carriage, which at the present time seems
bulky and impracticable.”

Veterinarians today

That the machine age did not make the
veterinarian extinct is evident by the fact
that there are 22,000 veterinarians in the
United States today. They are ﬁghting live-
stock disease and protecting public health
by guarding against diseases transmissible
through supplies of meat, poultry, eggs and
butter. They are developing new serums and
vaccines that every year save millions of
human and animal lives. They operate ani-
mal hospitals to care for pets. They are now
reversing the trend which 160 years ago
brought the ﬁrst veterinarian to the United
States from Europe. Today American veteri-
narians are helping to start veterinary schools
and laboratories all over the world. Some
are serving in the Peace Corps. And the
nuclear age ﬁnds veterinarians among the
pioneer scientists working on space projects.

Seeds sown by veterinarians in their ani-
mal research have blossomed into dramatic
advances in human medicine. A Viennese
veterinarian, Dr. Franz Benesch, developed
spinal anesthesia. An Illinois veterinarian,
Dr. Otto Stader, revolutionized the whole
ﬁeld of'orthopedic surgery with his bone-
pinning method of handling fractures.

Working with hemorrhagic disease in
cattle, Dr. Frank Schoﬁeld, a Canadian,
made one of the twentieth century’s great
medical discoveries. His work led directly
to the anti-coagulant drug dicumeral, which
has saved untold lives that would have suc-
cumbed to coronary thrombosis, one of our
society’s main causes of death. A veterinarian
solved the mystery of botulism (food poison-
ing), thus paving the way for the canned
food industry.

A French veterinarian, Dr. Camille Guerin,
developed a vaccine against tuberculosis, and
his colleague, Dr. Gaston Ramon, helped re-
duce the menace of diphtheria and tetanus.
And in the United States veterinarians have
virtually wiped out the dread bovine tuber-
culosis, transmissible to humans, which pro-
duced so many of the hunchback people seen
in years gone by. History does indeed owe
many remarkable achievements to the men
who care for animals.

RABBITS AS PETS
By the Veterinary Staff
1 ASPCA Hospital and Clinic

Live rabbits should be given to children as
Easter gifts only if the children are old enough
and have the proper outdoor facilities to care
for them. With their quiet beauty rabbits can
be delightful pets if given the right care. Of
the many rabbit breeds Flemish, New Zealand
and Chinchillas make good pets. Angoras are
beautiful, but need daily brushing and comb-
ing because of their long coats. Never keep
a wild rabbit as a pet.

Hutch

Build a cage to house the rabbit before
buying the pet. A rabbit hutch of 5/8 inch
wire mesh must be at least two feet high and
wide and at least four, but preferably six,
feet long. The ﬂoor should have a removable
metal tray to simplify cleaning. Heap the
tray with sawdust, wood shavings, shredded
newspaper or other absorbent material. Pro-
vide a sleeping box nested with hay or straw.

Since the rabbit is essentially a wild ani-
mal, the hutch should be outdoors except in
cold weather. Insulate it against the wind and

I rain and shelter it from excessive sun.

Sanitation

11 Keeping the cage absolutely clean is essen-
tial. Rabbit manure, soiled bedding and un-
used food should be removed daily. Clean
and refill the water trough every day. Wash
the trough in hot, soapy water and rinse be-
fore reﬂlling. Scrub the hutch thoroughly
about once a week.

Feeding

   

Whole grain such as oats, wheat, buck-
wheat, barley should be fed daily. Protein, an
essential part of the diet, is available in pet
shops in the form of pellets. Soybeans, sesame
seeds and linseed are also rich in protein.
Supplement with well-washed vegetables
such as lettuce, carrots, turnips, cabbage, kale,
beets, or dandelion leaves, grass or clover.
Make a feeding dish in one corner to protect
food from dirt and contamination. Suspend
greens in a wire rack so the animal can pull
out what it wants.

Feed twice a day, giving green vegetables
in the morning and grain at night. Leave the
grain in the feeding trough overnight for the
rabbit to nibble as it chooses. Add extra salt
to the daily food. Water must be available
constantly and should be changed daily. Use
a heavy water crock which the rabbit can’t
tip over. Rabbits are susceptible to pneumonia
if they become wet.

Handﬁng

Never lift a rabbit by the ears or legs. The
best way to pick up a rabbit is to grasp the
fold of skin over its shoulders with one hand

and support the animal from underneath
with the other.

Health

Cleanliness is the surest way to keep your
pet well. Feed clean, crisp food. Keep an
animal out of drafts or dampness. Examine
the ears periodically for ear mites. If any
are present, swab the ears gently with a mild
soap solution, rinse thoroughly with clear
water and apply a liberal amount of slightly
warm mineral oil. Badly infected ears require
professional treatment by a veterinarian.

Snuffles (contagious rhinitis), a nasal cold
with discharge, is common in spring or fall
due to change of weather. It starts with a
running nose and sneezing and is contagious.

Another disease common in rabbits is coc-
cidiosis, an intestinal disease characterized
by diarrhea and general weakness. It can be
prevented by keeping the hutch dry and clean.
Consult a veterinarian for treatment.

Book on ASPCA

slated for October publication

“Fifty Years in the Doghouse” is the title
of a book launched last December when a
three-way contract was signed by the ASPCA,
a prominent author and a top book publisher.

The ﬁfty years refers to Inspector William
Ryan, who last year rounded out a half
century of continuous service to the Society.
In his long career as the ASPCA’s ace
trouble shooter Mr. Ryan has hauled cats
out of chimneys, pulled a horse out of a
sewer, corralled a footloose lion, captured a
rampaging elephant, rescued 76 horses
from a burning barn and trapped a clever
escaped monkey that eluded all other pur-
suers for six weeks. Mr. Ryan will be the
book’s central ﬁgure, but interwoven with
his colorful experiences will be the history,
background and services of the ASPCA.

The book will be written by Lloyd Alex-
ander, “as-told-to” author of “Park Avenue
Vet,” the current best-seller about a veteri-
narian with a 40-year practice on Park

Avenue. Mr. Alexander has written twelve
books, including novels, short stories, poems
and translations from French works.

“Fifty Years in the Doghouse” will be his
third book about animals. Before “Park
Avenue Vet” he wrote “My Five Tigers”
about his own ﬁve cats—Solomon, Moira,
Aurelius, Sylvester and Kangaroo. Mr. Alex-
ander, his Parisian wife and his ﬁve cats
live in a wooded suburb of Philadelphia,
where he enjoys feeding the squirrels and
wild birds that are his neighbors.

G. P. Putnam’s Sons, one of the country’s
outstanding book publishers, will publish
“Fifty Years in the Doghouse.” The book

is slated for publication in October.

In gathering material for the book Mr.
Alexander interviewed some two dozen pres-
ent and retired ASPCA employees and made
28 hour-long tape recordings, encompassing

150,000 words.

author of the forthcoming book, “Fifty Years in the Doghouse.”

by way of Lawrence College in Appleton,
Wisconsin, where he once rode his pony into
the auditorium and himself out of the student
body, Winslow went to Wyoming and Mon-
tana, gathered horses, wranglers and a herd
and established a ranch. He later owned,
bred and handled English setters. His dogs
were trained to the tap of their master’s
toe; one could pick up and carry an egg in
its mouth without breaking it.

NE October day in 1958 Ken and Teresa

made the last trip to Green Island be-
fore leaving for their visit on the Big Main-
land. As usual they dropped the red plastic
bowl of food and vitamins well out on Ten
Pound Beach and then made to windward
around North Beach Peninsula. There Wins-
low cut his motor, broke out his seven-power
binocular and let the skiff drift aimlessly
around the point.

There in the glasses was TeePee—small,
tawny and apparently part boxer— nose in

the red bowl!

 

“All I could think of was Balboa,” Teddy
said later. “Ken just sat there and grinned.”

When Winslow returned to Antigua the
man-dog friendship began to develop in
earnest, but slowly. At ﬁrst the Winslows
would set the bowl on the beach, pull away
a bit, and watch TeePee eat. If a human
spoke or moved within 30 feet the dog would
run. Time and patience were needed. Wins-

low had plenty of both.
One day in 1959 Ken settled himself on

Ten Pound Beach, took some food in his
hand and held it out. TeePee lay watching
for maybe half an hour, then began to
crawl on his belly, slowly inching his way
closer and closer. It took him another half
hour to reach the food. “I half expected to
have my ﬁngers nipped,” Winslow said, “but
he took the food gently, ran down the beach
and ate it.”

FTER that TeePee regularly fed beside
the man he had accepted so slowly, and
it got so Winslow could even put his hand on

TeePee stops on the shore to bark a loud greeting as the Winslows’ outboard motor nears Green Island.
He howls iust as vehemently when Ken and Teddy leave.

Family of eleven welcomes homeless horse

A Mahopac, New York, family of eleven
recently put out the welcome mat for a
chestnut horse with soulful brown eyes, made
homeless by the death of his Great Neck
owner. The ASPCA found a new home for
the ten-year-old gelding with George Stewart
and his family of nine children.

Rising Tide had been stabled at Lakeville
Stables, Great Neck, since his owner, Harold
L. Hyman, died. In settling the estate Mr.
Hyman’s father, Henry Hyman, had many
offers to buy the horse. But he turned them
all down and appealed to the ASPCA. “Rising
Tide was my son’s pride and joy,” he said,
“and my only interest is that he ﬁnd a home
with the right family.”

By coincidence, only a few weeks before

Mr. Hyman’s call to the ASPCA Mr. Stewart

had asked the Society whether there was
any possibility of adopting a pony for his
family. His children, ranging in age from six
to 21, were clamoring for a pony, and Mr.
Stewart felt he could take good care of one
on his four-acre home in Mahopac. This
seemed like the perfect match.

An ASPCA veterinarian examined Rising
Tide and pronounced him in excellent health,
but a little overweight from lack of exercise.

Mr. Stewart rented a horse van and drove
to Great Neck, accompanied by three of his
children. “The children haven’t slept a Wink
since they heard they were getting a horse,”
he said.

Formal adoption papers were signed and
Rising Tide was on his way to a new lease
on life. (See cover picture.)

ANIMALS

IN THE

N EWS

Imagine anything worse than an ele-
phant with a stuffed-up nose? An ASPCA
veterinarian paid a call on an ailing elephant
with just such a complaint at the Clyde Beatty
Circus when it played at the Colisseum.

Elephant handlers shackled the eleven-year-
old pachyderm and pushed her over on her
side so the doctor could climb up on her
stomach and reach into her nose. Circus
boys grabbed her trunk to keep it from
swinging while the veterinarian made his
diagnosis. He found a growth the size of a
prune blocking her breathing passage.

The doctor decided to operate. He gave
the two-ton elephant a local anesthetic, cut
out the growth and cauterized the wound.
Twenty minutes later the animal drank water
and that evening went back into the lineup
without missing a performance. That’s show
business!

Tired motorists driving home along the
Hutchinson River Parkway, Bronx, honked
their horns in annoyance at two inky black
ﬁgures standing smartly at attention in the
middle of the road. As they drew closer they
were startled to ﬁnd the hitchhikers were
two sleek seals, waving their ﬂippers wildly
at passing cars.

Police called the ASPCA at 8:42 pm. and
by 9:25 Chauffeur Arthur Thornton had
coaxed the seals into his ambulance and had
bedded them down in separate outside runs
at the shelter. Next morning as soon as the
neighborhood ﬁsh store opened for business

District Manager N. Michael Bromley bought

14

 
  

 

 

 

four pounds of sardines and two pounds of
whiting. He later found out seals eat 15
pounds of ﬁsh a day in ﬁve pound meals and
became the store’s biggest customer.

The seals, it was discovered, had escaped
from the F reedomland amusement park a half
mile from the road where they were found.
The park got its seals back, but not before
ASPCA agents recommended they be housed

in an escape-proof enclosure in the future.
I I I

After handling 114 different species of
animals in the ﬁve years the ASPCA Animal-
port has been open Resident Manager George
Bauer thought he’d reached :the limit. But
the list of animals passing through our
facility at New York International Airport
keeps growing. He recently hosted three new
species from overseas.

Number 115 was a three-quarter-ton hip-
popotamus on his way to a midwest zoo.
Number 116 was an aardvark, an animal
resembling a pig, traveling from a German
Zoo to one in St. Louis. He racked up num-
ber 117 with a ranagoliath, a rare type of
frog weighing 15 pounds and measuring six
feet in length.

I I I

In recent months the ASPCA has pro-
vided direct assistance, material aids and
personal consultation to several societies
overseas. Foreign countries, particularly in
Asia and Africa, are now adopting humane
attitudes and laws we have taken for granted
for years. Many stand now where :the United
States stood a century ago when Henry Bergh

The winners, who came from all over the
country, were entertained at a luncheon by
ASPCA President Rockefeller.

The ASPCA Horsemanship Class, open to
youngsters under 18, is designed to empha-
size to children the importance of kindness
and gentleness in handling their mounts. To
be eligible for the ﬁnals at the National,
riders must win ﬁrst in the class during the
year at local recognized shows. They are
judged on horsemanship, hands, legs, seat
and jumping.

The original trophy was donated by the
late Alfred B. Maclay in 1933. Mrs. Maclay
has now set up a fund in memory of her
husband. The fund’s income will be used
to purchase replica trophies to be awarded to
annual winners in perpetuity.

 




 

 

 

HIS is a story about a man and a dog
-——a wild dog—«the Wild Dog of
. Antigua.

It all began one January night six years
ago when trade Winds from the Atlantic
carried a mournful wail across half a mile
of blue Caribbean water.

Kenelm Rogers Winslow listened to the
faint cry from his terrace at the Mill Reef
Club on the island of Antigua. “Hear that?”
he asked two house guests from New York.
“I’ve heard that sound for several, nights
now. First we thought it was a loon, but it’s
more like a bowl. I’ll bet there’s a dog on
Green Island.”

A lush, verdant jungle, half a mile wide
and two miles long, Green Island is unin-
habited, but several Mill Reef residents, in-
cluding Winslow and his wife, Teresa, picnic
there every Sunday.

“If it’s a dog,” said Winslow grimly, “it’ll
die out there.”

Antigua, Britain’s easternmost outpost in

the Leeward Islands, 1900 miles southeast of
New York, has a population of 55,000. Most
are natives— and most natives are poor.
Every family Seems to turn up with at least
one unwanted, starving dog that eventually
becomes a vagrant, a chicken killer, or a
menace to sheep, calves and goats. Getting
rid of an unwelcome dog is ticklish because

permits are needed for guns, and poison is

hard to come by lawfully. Some natives solve
the problem by marooning unwanted dogs on
islets off the mainland, frequently tying them

the dog’s head while he gulped from the red
bowl. In the beginning the dog ran away
after his meal, dug himself a hole and
watched them from afar. But then he would
linger a while after eating.

The friendship blossomed for two years
but in all that time, except for the howling
they ﬁrst heard, TeePee never uttered a
sound and never wagged his tail.

“Here’s how I got him to bark,” Ken
proudly reported. “I picked up his bowl—
he knew it by now—and walked up the
beach with it. TeePee was irked because he
thought I was taking his food away. He
threw back his head and spoke a loud protest.
We’d ﬁnally broken the ice.”

Today TeePee barks when the Winslows
come and howls when they leave. His tail
now whips back and forth without a stop.
He used to live in the middle of the island
in dense brush. Now he’s moved to a cave
under some trees on a steep point closest to
the Winslow section of Antigua.

TeePee knows the puttputt of the Winslows’
motor. As their 16-footer zooms toward the
island Teddy and Ken can see him high on
a bluff, barking his head off and wigwagging
his safety valve.

He runs down a trail he’s marked for him-
self, trying to outrace the skiff to the beach.
Winslow always lets him win. When they
leave, TeePee tears along the beach, follow-
ing the boat till it’s out of sight. He tilts his
head and wails a doleful, reluctant goodbye.

The food and vitamins Winslow brings
two or three times a week are only incidental.
TeePee was never thin but Ken can only
surmise where he gets his daily food. The
only wildlife on the island are a few rare
black rats, lizards and land crabs that bur-
row in the ground.

Where TeePee got his water was an even
bigger mystery. There’s no fresh water pond
or lake on Green Island and flash rain
showers are the rule. TeePee drinks the
water Winslow brings, but never seems extra-
ordinarily thirsty. The answer came one day
When Winslow saw the dog lope up to a

22

century plant —— a kind of cactus— dig into
the plant and extract water from the roots.

TEEPEE today is seven, possibly eight
years old. Others than the Winslows have
played with him—even held him in their
arms — many times in the last two or three
years. Such familiarity Winslow tolerates
only with the restraint of a good host, but he
brooks no outside participation in the red
bowl routine.

“I really don’t want to feed him too well,”
Winslow said on a New York Visit in 1962.
“When I’m away, for instance, I want him to
be self-sufﬁcient.”

The dog seems in perfect health, except
for an eye injury, possibly from a cactus
spine. Whenever he has a house guest, Wins-
low always says: “Let’s go feed TeePee.” He
recently hooked a New York veterinarian
into the feeding expedition, with the ulterior
motive of getting him over to examine Tee-
Pee. The doctor pronounced the dog healthier
than many he sees in his practice. His teeth
are tartar free, white, strong and ﬁrm. His
coat shines like a seal’s, and strangest of all,
he has no ticks or ﬂeas. Natives’ dogs all
have ticks. Undoubtedly he was full of them
when he was put on the island. How come
none now? Mon, who know?

Winslow has heard many suggestions as to
what to do with TeePee, including putting a
female dog on the island. Most people who
hear TeePee’s story for the ﬁrst time im-
mediately ask, “Well, if he’s so tame now,
why don’t you take him home?”

Winslow’s answer runs something like this:

“First of all, this animal undoubtedly was
taken off the mainland because he didn’t ﬁt
in one way or another. He was seemingly
afraid of human beings for nearly two years
from the moment I ﬁrst tried to bring him
to me.

“Second, TeePee doesn’t like other dogs.
He keeps his distance when I take my setter
or my dachsie to Green Island and when
other picnickers show up with dogs TeePee
refuses to appear at all.

Seventeen horses saved from blazing inferno

Swift, sure ASPCA know-how is credited
with saving 17 horses from a burning inferno
when a 100-year-old Bronx stable burned to
the ground on February 2. Fifteen horses lost
their lives in the two-alarm blaze, which
raged out of control for about an hour in a
freezing rain at the Woodlawn Stable, Bain-
bridge Avenue.

Two ASPCA men, Special Agent Balluff
and Chauffeur Edward Koll, assisted by
three off-duty mounted patrolmen, a Fire De-
partment chaplain and a bystander, plunged
into the dark, smoke-ﬁlled ruin and led 25
terriﬁed horses to safety. Five horses had
burned to death before the men could reach
them. Two others, down and beyond re-
demption, were mercifully put to sleep where
they lay by Agent Balluff. Smoke inhalation
caused three more to hemorrhage, and they
were destroyed on the street.

The surviving horses, drenched from ﬁre-
men’s hoses, some badly burned, and some
suffering smoke poisoning were sheltered in
a nearby garage. A Police Department vet-
erinarian who later arrived on the scene
suggested the soaked horses be covered with

blankets to prevent shock and pneumonia.
Horse blankets were hard to dig up Sunday,
at 1 :45 a.m., but Edmond M. Rowan, ASPCA
Director of Humane Work and a retired
Army colonel, fell back on his former Army
associates and telephoned Fort Slocum, located
on an island in Long Island Sound off New
Rochelle. Fifty horse blankets were ferried
across and the surviving horses were bedded
down for the night.

Two more horses were destroyed later that
night and three the next day. A chestnut
Arabian mare and a pinto mare, both suffer-
ing smoke inhalation, were taken to the

ASPCA hospital for treatment.
The Society is proud of Balluff and K011,

who braved smoke and ﬁre, risked being
kicked by terriﬁed animals in the dark stable,
and stayed on the scene until the last horse
was evacuated. The ASPCA will honor the
{three patrolmen, the chaplain and the by-
stander who helped with the rescue. They
will be awarded the ASPCA Medal of Honor
and Certiﬁcate of Merit at our Annual Meet-
ing in May.

The ASPCA found it for us...

Last year the ASPCA Adoption Service placed 21,312 animals in homes.
That’s more animals adopted than ever before in its 97-year history.

Here’s what the Adoption Service offers:
Finds homes for homeless animals at no charge.

Examines adopted pets free in the ASPCA Hospital and gives the
animal one free serum inoculation against communicable disease if recom-
mended by the veterinarian.

Spays adopted pets in the ASPCA Hospital free of charge for hospital-

ization, entrance, drugs and inoculations. The owner pays only the surgical fee.
Gives free literature and advice on care of newly adopted pets.

We’ve got lots of friends looking for homes this year. It costs the ASPCA

money to keep them, feed them and get them in condition to move into a new
home. Will you please help by contributing now to the

ASPCA PET ADOPTION SERVICE
