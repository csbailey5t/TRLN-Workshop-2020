THE BISHOP OF MANCHESTER
AND DR, WICKHAM LEGG.

 

 

[Nata—A Letter, headed Vivisecm'on and Evolution, by
Dr. W. Legg, appeared in the Church Times, October 28th. In
this (rather lengthy) production the writer says :—

“ Those who have made a special study of morals tell me,—
friend and foe to the animals alike,—that the Christian law
of morals does not allow that animals have more rights than
plants or stones. The reason that the inﬂiction of wanton
unnecessary pain upon animals is forbidden is, not because
they have any rights, but because man, by giving way to his
passions, becomes even as the brutes. . . . If the Anti-
vivisectionist view is to prevail, it means the suppression of
historical Christianity.”

In reference to the above and to the remainder of the letter,
the Bishop of Manchester wrote as follows to a lady with
permission to make use of his observations at her discretion]

Dr. Legg makes these two assertionsz—(l) “That the
Christian law of morals does not allow that animals have
more rights than plants or stones.” (2‘) “That if the Anti-
vivisectionist View is to prevail, it means the suppression of
historical Christianity.” These assertions are so extra-
vagant that one naturally asks oneself can they be made
in good faith ‘2 Assuming that they are so made—I
make the following remarks upon them :—

Assertion (1) must be proved from the New Testament.
Where is there a single passage which afﬁrms or implies any
such monstrous afﬁrmation ? It is true that the question of
the relation between men and the lower animals is never
directly discussed in the New Testament, but does silence
permit any one to ﬁll its spaces as he pleases? The New

Testament is silent upon questions of historical and textual
criticism, but is any one at liberty for that reason to foist
into it any critical theories he pleases?

Again, although the New Testament contains no direct
statements upon the claims of the lower animals, it cannot be
said that it is without great ethical principles which may
establish or illustrate those claims.

It shows us that God is love, that the love of God has
achieved the redemption of man from evil, that God feeds
the ravens, and that we have the right to hope “that the
creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of
corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of God.”
Again, with respect to man, we are told, “he that dwelleth
in love dwelleth in God,” and. are bidden by the Lord Jesus
Himself “to be perfect as our Father which is in heaven is
perfect.”

Will any one venture to say that we are imitating the love
of God when we are submitting His creatures to prolonged
torture ? For we must insist upon it that the inferior
animals are God’s creatures. If any one shall urge that they
and we alike are the chance productions of unconscious forces,
We have nothing to answer but that we believe such a state-
ment to be untrue. But if the animals are God’s creatures,
then—no matter by what method, whether that of
evolution or any other—God gave them a bodily consti-
tution sensitive to pain. He has also given us an
understanding to discover that they have such a constitution.
What follows then ? Surely this—that whatever our rights
over the animals may be—we should not outrage that God-
given constitution, by subjecting them to prolonged torture
for any purpose whatsoever. If any one objects to use the
word “rights ” in relation to animals, at least, he must
admit that they have this “claim” upon us, that we shall not
use them “as if they were plants or stones,” because God
made them capable of pain, and we know it; and because in
our conduct to them we ought to be as loving as God is in
His conduct towards us—thus “being perfect as our Father-

in heaven is perfect.”

If we refuse to acknowledge any such obligation, then
What plea could we advance to a superior race which was

torturing us for its own selﬁsh purposes, on the ground that.

it had absolute and illimitable power over us ‘2 If the
natural constitution which was imposed upon the animals
without their will gives them no claim to merciful considera—
tion, then how could our natural constitution give us any
like claim ‘2 The position of the Wivisectionist is simply
this,—that a superior creature can owe no duties to an inferior
creature, and that the only laW of his action towards such
a creature is the brutal law that Might gives Right. There
were certain Christian fatalists who held this doctrine in.
respect to the relation of God to man. And how did the
enlightened conscience of all Christendom reply to this.
doctrine ‘2 It replied thus : That if God refused to acknow-
ledge any claim to pity or consideration on the part of His
creature, He could not be just, could not- be loving, and,
therefore, could neither be loved nor worshipped.

After what I have said upon the relation of Anti-vivisection
to the great ethical principles of the Gospel, it surely cannot
benecessary to take serious notice of the wild assertion that
“the Anti—vivisectionist View . . . . means the suppression
of historical Christianity.” It is not a whit less absurd than
would be the statement that the prevalence of the vegetarian
view, or of the teetotal View involves a similar dire result.
I have heard the statement from alarmist reactionarles, that
historical Christianity must be abandoned, if the Mosaic
authorship of the whole of the Pentateuch be denied; but I
did not expect such foolish declarations from professed
scientists. I am very sorry that in consequence of lack of
time, I have had to write on such a subject currente calamo,
but trusting to your kind indulgence,

I am, yours very sincerely,
J. MANCHESTER.
