nun CASE FﬂR SLAUGHTER REFRM

Many thousands of animals are killed every day in this
country by old-fashioned methods, which involve totally
unnecessary suffering and distress.

What We Object to:
THE USE OF THE POLE-AXE in killing large animals. With

it the slaughterman will often strike the animal in the wrong
place, and many blows are frequently struck before a bullock
is brought down. There are cases on record of from three to
thirteen blows being struck.

THE USE OF THE KNIFE without preparatory stunning in
killing pigs, calves, and sheep. Consciousness of pain continues
when the brain and spinal cord remain uninjured.

THE WAY ANIMALS ARE ROPED AND DRAGGED AND
DRIVEN to the point of slaughter.

T0 ANIMALS BEING SLAUGHTERED IN THE SIGHT OF EACH
OTHER, and standing awaiting their doom on ﬂoors covered
with blood and amid the carcasses of those slain.

TO PAIN-POISONED MEAT—known in the trade as “ fevered ”
meat—which is a danger to public health.

 

 

What We Ask for:

IMMEDIATELY: The use in every slaughter—house of the
mechanically-operatcd Humane Killers, through which death is
made swift and painless. Legislation which will make humane
killing universal and not a matter of local ruling.

ULTIMATELY: The abolition of private slaughter-houses and
the introduction of humanely-conducted sanitary public abattoirs on
the model of the best Continental abattoirs, such as the one in Bern e,
Switzerland. Only by centralising killing and raising the methods
of slaughter and inspection of meat to the highest pitch of efficiency
can the interests of humanity and public health be served.

The public can help by insisting that the home-killed meat they
buy is derived from animals stunned by humane and mechanically-
operated instruments.
