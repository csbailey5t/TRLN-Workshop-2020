FAY BRISK HONORED FOR ANIMALPORT BATTLE

Senator Lowell weicker (R~Conn.) presented the

Albert Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute

to Fey Brisk on January 10, 1976, the 10ist anniversary

of Dr. Sohweitzer’e birth.

In presenting the medel, Senator Weioker referred to
"very personal experiences in matters of concern to all of
you in this room. It is true that we passed through the
Senate at the tail end of this last session a bill for
humane treatment of smell animals being treneported by air
and rail. That legislation came into being because of the
efforts of Fag Brisk. There in nothing that hes a greater
impact on an individual or Congress as a whole than being
confronted with a bad situation which is deserving of
legieletion. Noboéy coulﬁ spend the evening I spent with
Fey and those dogs at the washington National Airport,
seeing the cruelty that was visited on those animals, and
not try to do something about it. Don‘t be too concerned
over the fact that it took almost five years to get to the
point where we are today." He told of other longudeleyed
legislation.

Senator Weicker then referred to "endeavors of the

Animal Welfare Institute for whales and dolphins....All of

 




 

you ehould know that my state of Connecticut just adopted,

this last year, and I might add specifically for purposes
of conservation so that focus could be drawn to it, the
whale as our state animal. It was done 30 it would assist
in the fight to preserve this greet animal."

He then told of hie encounter with a wild dolphin.
”About four yeare ago when visiting the island of St. Marks
in the Caribbean with my wife and children, we heard from
the natives of a dolphin that had come into a little cove
of St. Marks and wee swimming around there. From this
experience alone, you understand what the dolphin's all
about outedde marine museums, marinelande, or all those
other placee where people train them, they're not the
terrific animal that they're portrayed to be in the wild
state. We went down to that cove, Scot and Grey, my two
oldest eons and myself. we spent three hours in that cove
with no one else around. The dolphin bumped the boys and
rolled over, and we scratched him on his stomach. For three
hours we played with that animal, not in a museum setting
or a domesticated setting, but rather in the wild setting.
They are magnificent. Certainly every effort should be made
in the direction of saving them. I just went to make this
point: they are a truly intelligent and a lovely and

beautiful animal that deserves our compassion and our care,

 




 

and I say this from.pereenel experience."

Senator weicker spoke of Dr. Schweitzer as "a total
men involved with the animals and their humane treatment."
Speaking of hié.devotion to healing the sick, of his
achievement as one of the greet interpretere of Johann
Sebastien Bach, he reiterated that Schweitzer was a tetel
men and said, "Thet is what is celled for in this day and
age."

Presenting the medal, he spoke of the lifetime of
service of Fay Brisk for "those whe can't applaud, can’t
vote, can't pay one penny ~ so it’s really the greatest
service, the efforte that she bee expended on that dumb
but loving constituency. Se, Fey Brisk, the Albert
Schweitzer Medal of the Animal welfare Institute. The
words on the medal are: “WE need a boundless ethics which

will include the animals also’ to Fay Briek."

SENATOR LOWELL WEICKER . CONNECTICUT

A reputation for integrity, independence and unpredictability
has marked the CongreSSional career of Connecticut's Lowell Weicker.

Gaining national prominence in 1973 as the tough and thorough
Republican questioner on the Senate Select Committee on Presidential
Campaign Activities (the Watergate Committee), Weicker has been
equally active as a legislator.

Presently a member of the Senate's Commerce Committee, the
Committee on Government Operations, and the Select Committee on Small
Business, the freshman lawmaker has introduced numerous major bills
dealing with transportation, energy, housing, campaign reform,
taxpayer privacy and Congressional oversight of the CIA, FBI, etc.

Federal commitment to rails and mass transportation has been
one of his prime concerns. He has sponsored legislation to make
the railroads viable and reduce the country's dependence on the
automobile by abolishing the Highway Trust Fund. A sound, balanced
transportation program will conserve energy, reduce pollution and
better serve the nation's needs, Weicker believes.

Committed to open, honest government, Weicker has pushed for
campaign reforms born out of Watergate. He has also called for
net worth financial disclosure by federal officials and for new
laws assuring confidentiality of every individual's income tax
return.

Weicker's willingness to speak out on controversial issues has
won him the support of those he represents. In an eight—year span,
from 1962 to 1970, he won eight straight election victories which
carried him from the Connecticut General Assembly to the United
States Senate.

In recent years Senator Weicker has received a Doctor of
Sciences degree from the Bridgeport Engineering Institute, November,
1971; Doctor of Laws degrees from John Carroll University, May, 197”,
University of Bridgeport, December, 1979, University of Maine, May,
1975 and Fairleigh Dickenson University, May, 1975; and the Distin-
guished Public Service Award from the Los Angeles Society of Fellows
of the Anti-Defamation League of B'Nai B'Rith, December, 197a.

Weicker was born in Paris, France, May 16, 1931. He was . .
graduated from Lawrenceville School in 19kg, won his B.A. in Political
Science at Yale University in 1953 and his LL.B. at the UniverSity
of Virginia in 1958. He served as First Lieutenant of Artillery

in The Army 1953-55 and as Captain, USAR, 1959-69.

He is married to the former Marie Louise Godfrey. They have
three sons, Scot, Gray and Brian. The family reSides on Round Hill

Road in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Current Biography

WEICKER, LOWELL P(ALMER), JR. (WI-ker)

May 16, 1931- United States Senator fro-m
Connecticut

Address: b. 342 Old Senate Ofﬁce Building,
Washington, DC; h. ROund Hill Road, Green-
wich, Conn. 06830

Once a relatively unknown freshman legislator,
the junior member of the Senate Select Commit-
tee on Presidential Campaign Activities, Senator
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., uickly established a repu-
tation as one of the a lest and toughest ques-
tioners on the investigative panel looking into
Watergate. Considered a predictable Republican
voter, the senator surprised arty leaders by main-
taining a deﬁantly indepen ent course during the
committee hearings.

After listening to several weeks of testimony,
an outraged Weicker read into the record of the
nationally televised hearings a list of seventeen
“acts proven or admitted” by the executive branch,
including burglary, breaking and entering, per-
jury, and obstruction of a criminal investigation.
A maverick idealist with absolute faith in “Amer-
ica as advertised,” Weicker refuses to accept the
“barroom myth” that politics is, by its nature, a
dirty business. “Political espionage, surveillance
and disruption . . . doesn’t go on all the time
or even one-hundredth of the time,” Weicker
wrote in an opinion piece for the April 16, 1973
edition of the New York Times. He warned, how-
ever, that if the Senate hearings failed “to arouse
America’s basic honesty and idealism, then the
odious tactics . . . will de facto become the rules
for American elections.”

The second son of Lowell P. Weicker and the
former Mary Bickford Paulsen, Lowell Palmer
Weicker, Jr. was born on May 16, 1931 in Paris,
France. His father was manager of foreign opera-
tions and later president of the pharmaceutical
house of E. R. Squibb & Sons. His German-born
parental grandfather, Theodore, was a manufac-
turing chemist who acquired a controlling interest
in the Squibb ﬁrm in 1904 and served as its
executive vice-president and board chairman until
his death in 1940. The Weicker children grew up
on Park Avenue in New York City, and spent
their summers in Oyster Bay, Long Island. Ac-
customed to afﬂuence, Lowell P. Weicker Jr., ac-
cording to one Washington observer, developed
“that utter conﬁdence that seems to come with
absolute economic self-sufﬁciency.” Introduced to
campaigning by his politically active mother, ﬁve-
year-old Lowell Weicker distributed Alf Landon
buttons durin the Presidential campaign of 1936.
A few years ater he enacted the role of Frank-
lin Delano Roosevelt in a :mock election at the
private Buckley School in Manhattan. “I looked
upon politicians as I looked upon baseball and
hockey players,” Weicker recalled to James M.
Perry in an interview for the National Observer
(April 7, 1973). “They were my idols.” ‘

After graduating from exclusive Lawrenceville
School in 1949, Weicker enrolled at Yale Uni-
versity where he majored in political science. He
obtained a BA. degree in 1953. At Yale, he
played polo and rowed on the junior varsity crew.
An active member of the local Republican youth
organization, he joined the Political Union, the
campus debating society. “I belonged to the Bull
Moosers,” Weicker recalled for William H. Rudy
in an interview for the New York Post (October
2, 1970). “In my ﬁrst or second debate I got
involved with [William F J Buckley. I broke in
pretty fast.” Interrupting his academic career,
Weicker served as a ﬁrst lieutenant in the United
States Army from 1953 to 1955. Returning to
civilian life, he entered the University of Virginia
School of Law, which granted him an LL.B. de-
gree in 1958.

Admitted to the Connecticut‘bar in 1960, Weic-
ker became a founding member of a Greenwich
law ﬁrm and practised for several years before
turning his attention to a political career. In his
ﬁrst campaign, in 1962, he was elected to the
Connecticut state assembly by a comfortable mar-
gin. He was reelected in 1964 and 1966. Repre-
senting Greenwich, -Weicker led the legislative
defense of residential zoning and acted as legis-
lative consultant to the Connecticut Transporta-
tion Authori and as secretary to the Connecti-
cut Tax Stu y Commission. At the same time he
served as Greenwich’s First Selectman, the equiv-

alent of mayor. One of the reasons for 'Weicker’s
popularity as a city official was the fact that he
managed to keep the local tax rate among the
lowest in the state.

In 1967, nearly a year before the election,
Weicker announced his intention to challenge
incumbent Congressman Donald J. Irwin, a Dem-
ocrat who had represented Connecticut’s Fourth
Congressional District since 1964. So tireless and
enthusiastic a campaigner that he lost thirty-ﬁve
pounds during the cam. ai , Weicker blanketed
the district and indivi ual y contacted as many
voters as possible. Responding to the public’s
growing dissatisfaction with the Johnson admin-
istration’s military polio in Southeast Asia, Weic-
ker condemned Irwin’s hawkish position and urged
an immediate bombing halt in Vietnam. With 52
percent of the vote, the largest plurality in twelve
years, Weicker defeated Irwin and a third peace
party contender, Morris Earle, by 9,026 votes.

In his ﬁrst year in Congress, Weicker won an
almost unprecedented victor for a freshman legis-
lator. He drafted an amen ment to the Housing
and Urban Develo ment Act of 1969 stipulating
that urban renewa plans must include provisions
for the replacement of demolished housing units
on a o-ne-for-one basis. With bipartisan support,
the bill passed the House 116 to 92 and was
signed into law by President Richard Nixon on
December 24, 1969. During his term in the House,
Weicker also submitted legislation to increase
Social Security beneﬁts, to require full ﬁnancial
accounting from hi h governmental ofﬁcials, to
provide federal fungi for a National College of
Ecological and Environmental Studies, and to
safeguard the health of animals during airplane
ﬂights.

Named to the House GOP task force on trans-
portation shortly after the Ninety-ﬁrst Congress
convened in January 1969, Weic er chaired the
subcommittee on ground transportation and spon-
sored the emer ency Connecticut Transportation
Act that kept t e New Haven Railroad running
until it merged with the Penn Central. The fol-
lowing year he introduced a bill authorizing a
governmental study to determine the feasibility
of establishing a nationally coordinated transporta-
tion system. On other domestic issues, he approved
the right of eighteen-year-olds to vote, the equal
rights amendment prohibiting sex discrimination,
and the omnibus “D.C. crime bill” that included
the controversial “no—knock” entry provision. A
vocal advocate of President Nixon s “Vietnamiza-
tion” program, Weicker supported the American
invasion of Cambodia during an an ﬂoor de-
bate and insisted that “the policy 0 this admin-
istration is a policy of withdrawal.” Reﬂecting
his unpredictable voting behavior, the liberal
Americans for Democratic Action rated him at
40 percent and the conservative Americans for
Constitutional Action at 41 percent.

Having served only one term in the House,
Weicker decided to run for the Senate seat held
by retiring Senator Thomas J. Dodd, even though
it meant facing his eighth election in eight years.
“I either wanted to make it or get out,” he ex-
plained to an interviewer for the Ralph Nader
Congress Project. Weicker was opposed in the
ﬁrst statewide primary in Connecticut history by
state senator John Lupton, a conservative Re-
publican. In reply to Lupton’s charges that he
voted more like a “liberal Democrat” than a Re-
publican, Weicker defended his record and as-
sured the crowds at political rallies that although
he “always believed we had a great President
. . . ,” he was “not a rubber stamp.” Endorsed
by 70 percent of the Republican state convention
delegates, Weicker defeated Lupton by more than
25,000 votes. In the three-way general election
in November, Weicker received 41.7 percent of
the votes cast, defeating the Democratic con-
tender Joseph D. Duffey, and the independent
challenger, former Senator Dodd.

By his own estimation, during his ﬁrst two
years in ofﬁce Weicker spent most of his time
“representing Connecticut.” To maintain close
contact with his constituents, the senator estab-
lished regular weekend hours at his Connecticut
ofﬁce, arranged consultations with local civil lead-
ers, and wrote a weekly column [that appeared
in newspapers throughout the state. On the Sen-
ate ﬂoor he continued to push for more generous
federal funding of public transportation systems.
As a stopgap solution to the nation’s “creeping”

 




I ~ It

transportation problems, Weicker proposed in-
creased funds for AMTRAK and the diversion of
moneys from the highway trust fund to mass
transit construction projects. A member of the
Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, he
vigorously defended NASA’s budget requests and
cited the beneﬁcial by-products of the space pro-
gram. Although a party loyalist who has generally
supported Nixon’s ‘enormously adventuresome
and innovative” foreign policy, he disagreed with
Nixon’s decision to mine Haiphong Harbor in
May 1972, contending that “this reaction cares
not a whit for either North . . . or South Viet-
namese.” Furthermore, he approved the Case-
Church amendment cutting off funds for the war
and in October 1973 voted with the majority to
limit the President’s war-making powers.

Noting that “every major scandal in public of-
ﬁce over the past twenty years was uncovered
by the ress,” Weicker introduced legislation to
safeguard journalists’ sources. In a Senate speech
on January 11, 1973 he maintained that the bill,
designed “to protect a constitutional right we
all have in the free flow of news” was “not for
newsmen” but “for the American public.” The
proposed law guarantees absolute immunit from
forced disclosure before grand juries and, other
investigative bodies and limited immunity before
open courts trying criminal cases. To explain the
importance of the bill to the public, Weicker
is writing an examination of recent governmental
threats to press freedom, in collaboration with
Bernie Yudian, an editorial writer for the Green-
wich, Connecticut daily newspaper, Time. The
book is tentatively titled “The Chilling Effect.”

As a member of the Republican Senatorial
Campaign Committee, Weicker was appalled by
the rampant political corruption of the 1972
Presidential campaign. He was particularly exer-
cised by the apparent misuse of enormous sums
of money extorted from corporations by the Com-
mittee to Reelect the President, in violation of
federal election laws. On a campaign swing
through Connecticut in October 1972, Weicker
told the Enﬁeld Teachers Association, “It’s the
Democrats who are the most intellectually dis—
honest, and . . . the Republicans who in their
actual deeds are the most dishonest.” Anxious to
restore honesty to the political process, Weicker
submitted a federal election reform act to the
Senate on March 13, 1973. The bill restricts
campaign contributions and expenditures to the
election year, limits each candidate to one polit-
ical committee, eliminates the collection of
“laundered” funds, and re uires complete dis-
closure of campaign costs efore the election.
Fines levied as penalties for violations of the
campaign law would be used to publicize the
infractions.

When the Senate voted unanimously to estab-
lish a bipartisan seven-member Select Committee
on Presidential Campaign Activities, Weicker
volunteered his services. “I’m a professional poli—
tician,” he explained at a news conference in late
March 1973. “Because of things like Watergate,
people have lost faith in politicians, and I want
to see that changed. The only thing that will
convince them to respect politicians is to bring
dirty business like the Watergate out in the
open.” One of the few Republicans to denounce
White House chief of staff H. R. Haldeman pub—
licly before the Senate committee investigations
began, Weicker was determined to pursue a non-
partisan course. In a statement at the opening
session of the hearings, chaired by Senator Sam
J. Ervin, Weicker told a nationwide television
audience that the “gut question” before the com-
mittee was “not one of individual guilt or inno-
cence” but “how much truth do we want. . . .
The story to come has its signiﬁcance not in the
acts of men breaking, entering and buggin the
Watergate, but in the acts of men who a. most
stole America.”

Relying on an indefatigable team of indepen-
dent legal researchers, Weicker conducted a sepa-
rate investigation of the Watergate break-in along
with related political scandals and released the
results of his inquiry to the full Senate commit-
tee. His staff uncovered dozens of incriminating
documents, includin evidence that United States
military agents ha spied on politically active
Americans in Europe; proof that one phase of
the Nixon domestic intelligence plan, originally
vetoed by J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, had been put
into effect; and several damning Haldeman
memoranda sug esting that the White House not
only approved ut also encouraged staiged anti-
Nixon demonstrations to elicit under 0g sym-
pathy from the voters. “This type of business,”
Weicker charged, “is a disgrace.”

In an emotional speech at the June 28, 1973
meeting of the Ervin committee, an an Sena-
tor Weicker, the victim of an attempt White
House “smear” campaign, warned: “There are
going to be no more threats, no intimidation, no
innuendo, no working through the press to . . .
destroy the credibility of individuals.” Apologiz-
ing to his colleagues for his “partisan moment,”
Weicker assured the ublic that “Republicans do
not cover up . . . , 0 not . . . threaten, do not
commit illegal acts. And, God knows, Repub-
licans don’t view their opponents as enemies to
be harassed.” Spectators in the gallery responded
with a long and loud ovation.

Although his outspokenness antagonized some
Republican regulars, Weicker enjoyed rapidly in-
creasing popularity among the voters. According
to a Louis Harris poll taken in August 1973,
45 percent of those questioned rated Weicker’s
conduct of the Watergate investigations as “ ood’
or “excellent,” while 18 percent evaluate his
performance as “only fair” or “poor.” His wide-
spread popularity and telegecnic appearance
prompted speculation of a possible 1976 Presi-
dential bid, but Weicker denied rumors of Presi-
dential ambitions to Ralph Blumenfeld in an in-
terview for a New York Post (July 7, 1973)
proﬁle. “They’ll have to ﬁnd someone who’s will-
ing to give 100 percent of his time,” Weicker
explained. “I like playing tennis and softball with
my sons, and hockey with my family. The Presi-
dent . . . has to give 100 percent of himse .”

Senator Weicker has repeatedly urged the
Nixon administration to formulate a national pol-
icy that is “pro-democracy”—one that emphasizes
the positive aspects of a representative form of
government rather than military might. “If
democracy is to be a champion, then we have to
have more than superiorit of arms,” Weicker
reasoned, as quoted by George Douth in his
Leaders in Proﬁle (1972). “We have to have
superiority of morals.” One of the most impor-
tant effects of the Watergate revelations, in
Weicker’s judgment, has been the “shift of power”
from the executive to the legislative branch of
government. Appearing on the August 12, 1973
edition of CBS-TV’s Face the Nation, the sena-
tor predicted that the return to a constitutional
participatory democracy would have “a profound
effect on the laws that are passed. It’s going to
be a long time before anybody tries these kinds
of stunts again.”

The tallest of all the senators, Lowell Weicker
Jr. stands six feet six inches tall. A hefty, broad-
shouldered man with graying brown hair, he
keeps ﬁt and maintains his weight at 218 pounds
by following a daily regimen of early morning
exercises and by playing tennis, polo, and base-
ball. Since his election to the House, he has
played in the annual Congressional baseball game
as a member of the Republican team. Shunning
the Washington cocktail party circuit, Weicker
often invites members of his staff for dinner and
an evening of bridge or Monopoly at his Arlin -
ton, Virginia apartment. An accomplished coo ,
he usually prepares the food himself. “I think
I make the best crepe suzettes in Washington,
D.C.,” he told William Greider in an interview
for the Washington Post (April 12, 1973).

On June 13, 1953 Lowell Weicker Jr. married
the former Marie Louise Godfrey. They have two
sons, Scot Bickford and Gray Godfrey. They are
legal guardians of Bryan Bianchi, a boy whom
the Weickers have been caring for since t e death
of his parents. The family lives in a weathered
stone farmhouse set on a ten-acre estate in Green-
wich, Connecticut, where Weicker raises horses,
chickens, a donkey, and several dogs.

The senator has declined several invitations to
White House social functions and, shortly before
the Watergate hearings began, refused to attend
President Nixon’s “peace with honor” reception
for legislators who had supported the administra-
tion’s war policy. “[The invitation] carried with
it the implication that those who weren’t invited
were not for peace, or were for peace with dis-
honor,” Weicker explained to Ralph Blumenfeld.
“I damn near climbed the wall. I felt deeply of-
fended. I didn’t go.”

DR. SCHWEITZER’S MESSAGE TO THE
ANIMAL WELFARE INSTITUTE

I am proufoundly moved that you would like to give my
name to the medal you have created. I give you this right
with all my heart. I would never have believed that my
philosophy, which incorporates in our ethics a compassion-
ate attitude toward all creatures, would be noticed and
recognized in my lifetime. I knew this truth would impose
itself one day on human thought, but it is the great and
moving surprise of my life that I should still be able to wit-
ness this progress of ethics.

Your medal celebrates this progress: philosophy obliged
to intervene for animals when up till now it has shown so
little interest in them.

WORLD DICTIONARY OF AWARDS AND PRIZES

Europa Publications plan to publish a World Dictionary of Awards
and Prizes which will provide a comprehensive description of major
awards and prizes in countries throughout the world.

The prizes and awards chosen for inclusion will be of national or
international standing and will cover a wide range of activities
including literature and the arts (painting, sculpture, music, theatre,
cinema, ballet, etc.), science and technology, medicine and education.
Prestigious lectureships will also be included but not scholarships or
fellowships. In addition, awards which have been discontinued but which
were once of major importance will be described.

We should be extremely grateful if you would send us details of
any awards and prizes you administer. The enclosed questionnaire is
designed to obtain, in concise form, as many details as possible about
the awards. Please complete and return it to us without delay. If your
institution makes several awards which fall within the scope of our
book, please provide details for all of them, using the questionnaire as
a guideline. Any additional information or relevant leaflets or reports
which you care to append will be most welcome.

We need your assistance to make the book as comprehensive and
accurate as possible. We very much hope that you will be able to help
. us and look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
