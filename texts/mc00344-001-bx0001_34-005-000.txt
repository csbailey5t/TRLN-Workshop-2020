Dear Mr. Wright,

Y’ Your splendid contribution to 2Q§_Bird Busniese;A§_Stud of
the Commercial gage Bird Trade is deeply appreciated. This 3 E35
f rat time we have been able to have color photographs in one of
our backs. It would not have been possible without your generosity
in printing them without charge. They make the hock not only for
more significant as a documentary but also especially attraccite.

To my sorrow, your first name. for some inexplicable reason
was incorrectly printed in the adknowledgments. I hepe you will
accept my personal apologies for this most unfortunate error.

Again, warmest thanks for your important role in making The
gird Business an effective weapon against the smugglers and tﬁEir
Supporters. The vote at New Delhi could not have been so overWhelming
Without your invaluable contribution. As you doubtless know, we
made a copy available to each delegate.

With very best wishes,

Yours sincerely,

Christine Stevens
President

Dear Greta:

Thank you very much for your most excellent book,

The Bird Business. You have made a tremendous con—
tribution to conservation and as a preserver of birds,
I express my humble thanks. I know the Gruidae will
benefit from your thorough analysis and presentation
of the problem.

 

I will continue to work with my friends in the parrot
world to get them on the "straight and narrow", a

goal that should continue as a great adventure. Cur—
rently I am attempting to have Walsrode Vogelpark hire
Holly Nichols, that is if she doesn't join a convent
first!

Greta, please do visit us if you are ever in the mid-
west.

I enjoyed meeting you in Florida but I regret we did
not have longer together.

Thank you again for your outstanding book, Greta.

Sincerely ever,

SOCIETY FOR ANIMAL PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION
P. O. Box 3719

Washington, DC. 20007

Statement of Christine Stevens, Secretary, on
ApproPriations for the Fish and Wildlife Service before the
Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior

March 26, 1981

The Society for Animal Protective Legislation recommends 1) an
increase in funds of $1,275,000 for the enforcement by the Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS) of the Lacey Act, Endangered Species Act,
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and Marine
Mammal Protection Act° ) restoration of $7.6 million to the
Endangered Species’ﬁg¥;§¢?aand 3) no increase in funding for Animal
Damage Control, but reiterate the 1979 directive with regard to
alternatives for steel 'aw%§£ ps. Additional funds to offset the
ahaVE'recommendationﬁda coma frommFish Hatcheriesna Policy

Budget and Administrationnaxéaé%uiqg&§£:

This is the year when the government is seeking to avoid loss of

funds through agency eXpenditure. However, vital law enforcement

to protect the taxpayer from criminal profiteers is the last place

to cut funds. To do so would be l)morally indefensible and 2)fiscally

irresponsible. <

In 1979 the Fish and Wildlife Service took in some $775,000 in fines
y and costs in enforcement of wildlife law. In addition it forfeited
‘y K goods including aircraft, guns, and automobiles worth an estimated
i\’jhalf million dollars. Although 1980 figures are not available, they
7 are eXpected to be at least as large. Thus, it is clearly good
business for the government to increase law enforcement strength in
this field of growing criminality because such enforcement produces
income. Like tax cut prOposals, increased funding for wildlife
law enforcement increases revenues to the Treasury.

No doubt you read about the daring undercover work recently conducted
by the Fish and Wildlife Service in seizing 10,000 pounds of walrus
lvory, 300 whale teeth and two narwhal tusks. The value of the ivory

SEiZBd is approximately one half million dollars. Two of the dealers
involved had made three million dollars.out of the: ivory trade
whiCh allegedly violated the Lacey Act, Marine Mammal Protection

Act and Endangered Species Act. The actions involved five states.

Our cenvereetian buoyed me up immeasurably. Here are three
chapters of the revised ”Bird Business” and some of the illustra~

New Delhi.

I am thrilled that you are willing to write a preface or

There is a moment in time when collective moods prevail and opinions tend to coalesce
about the way the world is wagging. Such a tide has enveloped this country over the past 20
years, running strongly in favor of conservation of the natural environment. Countervailing
elements come and go, but the tide has run positively in favor of a theme which represents a
new tradition. Authors have helped to promote this tide; William ,Vogt. Rachel Carson, Fairfield
Osborn. All of these writers and succeeding ones. most recently Norman Myers. have helped to
enhance the feeling of urgency about the life of animals and plants around our diminishing
globe. As space becomes‘condensed by travel and information exchange. we have becOme
more aware of the dimensions of the problems which confront ourselves and future genera-
tions.

This publication has to do with our enhanced concern about animals everywhere.
Throughout the world we now know that the natural resources are so finite that we must pro-
vide some kinds of regulations and legislation to control our use of what is left. As forests
decline, as water becomes impure, and as plants and animals are preyed upon relentlessly for
economic gain, the tensions evolve and the lists are drawn. l often feel that we as humans are
quite incapable of controlling either our own instincts, or regulating the environment around us.
As rational human beings we tend to feel that new laws and conventions should do the trick.
That we can regulate our appetites. our modes and mores, and that we can subjectively create
the discipline and the control which are required to save the environment is an'ideal.

Upon reflection I doubt that regulations in themselves will solve the problem. For example
a species of rare animals is unlikely to be saved by the weight of paper concerned in developing
legal constraints on its exploitation, trade or commerce, and least of all its underground exv
ploitation via smuggling and the constant ingenuity of humans to avoid restraints. The
likelihood remains that whatever laws or regulations may be in effect. someone can always
devise a loophole to avoid their observance.

Thus this book by Greta Nilsson describes the traffic in animals despite regulations, and
shows once again the difficulty of creating laws and then observing them. no matter how high
the degree of aroused concern. It is useful to remind ourselves of the methods by which smug-
gling of animals and the trade in the bodies ofliving creatures can continue in spite of the moral
and emotional concern a majority of people now feel. We should realize too that the keeping of
wild pets is an overwhelming danger to a host of species of colorful and attractive fellow
creatures representing the wonders of creation. "

So long as education and a degree of appropriate understanding fail to be universal in the
world at large, so long will these regulations and the moral revulsion of part of the human
population be treated with indifference in the rest of the world. How to solve this dilemma is at
present, apparently, still beyond our control.

It is therefore worthwhile reminding ourselves through the pages of Greta Nilsson's
accounts. of the continuing failure of laws alone. As President of the International Council for
Bird Preservation, having watched a generation of evolving concern for conservation I can only
assume that the struggle is not lost. so long as we continually remind ourselves that the practice
is far from perfect, but that the goal is worth every bit of the struggle.

Dear Fran:

Thank you for your notice that "The Bird Business"
is being reissued.

We have used the old publication for Congressional
testimony and public education. It has been a good,
reliable source of information. We have not used it
very much, but when it is needed there is nothing else
quite like it available. We are pleased to offer support.

As a procedural matter, Defenders would not want to
be listed as a "publisher" of the document, as that
implies responsibility for the content, accuracy, etc.
We cannot assume such responsibility. Rather, we should
be listed as a "sponsoring organization" or something
equivalent.

We would be willing to contribute up to $2000,
subject to further discussions with you.
