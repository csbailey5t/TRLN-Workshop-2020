Dear.Mrs. Stevens:

Accompanying this letter delivered by our messenger,
you will find a layout of the proposed display for the Schweitzer
Medal.

Due to the increased size and the cost of having this
special pad prepared, including the cost of engraving, this assembly
would be $60.

If you wish to return to the original idea of a small
wooden.mounting, this can still be handled for $30. The increase is

due to the rather lengthy inscription.

We would appreciate your advising us zeith which plan you

Gentlemen:

In response to your communication, 1 am happy to forward
to you my choice for the first Schweitzer Medal. With
great pleasure I nominate Dr. Carl G. Hartman and I am
sure that others have done likewise. Although I have
expressed my comments, I must say that much more could
have been said but for lack of space on the form.

Dr. Hartman is one of those rare individuals who combines
the qualities of scientific brilliance with human atti-
tudes, possibly more so than any other living scientist,
except perhaps Dr. Schweitzer himself.

It is with pride and pleasure I submit my recommendation.
Sincerely,

Nature of the work qualifying Jrhe above person to be considered for the award

(Please give reference if possible)

With more than three decades of brilliant work in the bio-
logic sciences, he has made notable contributions to the
fields of biology, physiology, endocrinology, anatomy and
medicine. His publication list is one of the most im-
posing in all medical sciences. His personal attributes as
a teacher, solentist and apprec1ator of the true values in

 

(Rmmemthe animal life and its scientific service to mankind is un-

more animals than any other living scientist and he should
be recognized for his efforts, kindness and humane approach
to the great scientific problems, many of which he has
personally solved.

He is unquestionably-the most qualified candidate for the
Schweitzer Medal.

Dear Miss Draper:

I regret that we have only our permanent file copy of the May 2 polio vaccine stony
about which you inquired. It was a rather long discussion of live and "killed" viruses.
The only reference to the tests was the followingjparagraph:

"The two live virus vaccines now are under test. One was developed by Dr. Albert B.
sabin of Cincinnati and has been used on a few volunteers as well as on animals. Another
was developed several years ago by Dr. Hilary Koprowski of Lederle Laboratories. It is
being tested on children in a California institution for the feeble minded after having
undergone long trials on animals."

we know nothing of the animal tests, but doubtless you can obtain more information
from.Drs. Sabin.and Koprowski.

a) Practical replacement of the higher mammals by such lower forms of.life
or life in lower stages of embryonic development (such as chick embryos)
with a view to reducing the suffering undergone by animals with highly
developed nervous systems.
Practical replacement of chronic experiments involving protracted.physical
or mental suffering by properly conducted sacrifice eXperiments with a View
to reducing the number of painful experiments.
The efficient statistical design of experiments so as to effect a systematic
economy in sampling. For example, methods whereby limitation of the num-
ber of variables introduced in an experiment makes possible the reduction

of the number of animals necessary.

The substitution of chemical and physical methods, whenever possible, for
biOlogical methods in experiments or tests.

e) The means of avoiding unnecessary repetition of eXperiments.

YOur suggestion of a name or names of persons who have made outstanding progress
in these or other fields affecting the welfare of laboratory animals will be welcomed.
Please fill out the form.belon'and mail it to the Animal welfare Institute, 350 Fifth
Avenue, New York 1, New York, before March 1, 1955.

manuscript is complete except for two drawings of infra-red
absorption curves. I have also attached reprints of the
author's own work referred to in the manuscript. This paper
has not yet been approved for publication but the method
described has been adopted by the committee on Revision of

the 11.5. Phannacopeia to replace the present bioaseay method
which requires the sacrifice of a dog.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not

My dear Miss Stevens:

Thank you for your letter of January 25, and I
am glad that Dr. Fischer's reprints will suffice, and
I will therefore release the type .

It is indeed unfortunate that the viewpoint expressed
by Dr. Fischer is the minority among animal experimenters.
As you may imagine , we have had some violent protests from
extreme AVs, although, as a mtter of fact, not as many as
I had anticipated, thus far.

While Alma talks constantly to her charges, she
rarely addresses me; but last week she did. In the
storm raging at the time, I was making my way into
the house via its rear steps when she stopped me cold.
"Doctor,” she inquired, ”do ﬁsh suffer pain?” That
was a poser, even for a professor. But since professors
are expected to know everything, I did the best I could
to uphold the reputation of the craft.

To this end I recalled the observations made, more
than ﬁfty years ago, in the Marine Biological Labora-
tory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, by a Texas biology
teacher named, W. W. Norman, who was associated
at the time with Jacques Loeb. Norman did not
exactly answer my Alma’s query, but what he had
observed bore heavily on the subject.

Norman had asked: ”Do the reactions of lower
animals indicate pain sensations?” To get an answer,
he had chopped a lot of earthworms in two, discovering
that after this injury the head end (supposedly the
recipient region of sensation) always continued to move
forward quietly, even as the tail end contorted. He
now cut each half-worm in half, to ﬁnd that the anterior
quarters continued to be or became quiet, even as
the posteriors began to, or continued to wriggle.

oxygen. the animal struggles not
at all and requires no holding
devices whatsoever.

I have rarely discussed these findings with my asso-
ciates; and never with my younger students. This
was to keep them free ofa false conclusion. for Norman’s
experiments do not prove that the animals suffer no
pain but only that their uncoordinated movements
are not proof of such. And it is most important for
the student that he hold to the assumption that stiffer
they do, for only so will he learn. early. proper regard

lives for him. i

is a minority that has believed the opposite.
In our country they compose the humane
societies and stand organized under various
urban, state and national names. Their inter-
est is chieﬂy in the domestic animals and
only sporadically in wild creatures, but what
they have done for the domestic animal’s
protection is much. By the turn of this cen-
tury they had removed the checkrein, with-
drawn the whip and watered the exhausted
horse; since when they have bettered the
housing conditions of our farm stocks in barn
and boxcar, and have largely eliminated the
spur and the goad.

If a date is desired as to when all this started,
call it 1875. At about that time Britain enacted
an animal practices law that forbade cock-
ﬁghts, bull-baiting and similar "sports”; even
as she so early passed regulations as to when
and how animals might be employed as

tory. the ﬁeld of anti-toxins by Dr. Shibasaburo Kitasato.

No one of heart or intelligence has ever
ﬁled objection to the attempt of the humane societies
to rescue, protect and by painless method bring death
to the hopeless. What was objected to in this try at
the suppression of cruelty to animals was their invasion
of the medical laboratory, where, dubbed antivivisec-
tionists, they have for some seventy-ﬁve years past
been alternately wrong or right. To convert the
onlooker to the antivivisection cause, it was common
practice, in the ﬁrst of these decades, to exhibit the
paraphernalia employed by the vivisectors in their
operative endeavors. Viewed superﬁcially the stuff
looked bad; but the horror evoked, quickly subsided
when interested persons were given entrance into any
well-equipped surgical pavilion. It takes an equally
fearful lot of castings, steel pipes, and straps, which
only a Houdini could unloose, just to hold a human
subject on the table; not to speak of the additional
restraints required to keep him in proper position for
surgery on his head, his loins or his backbone.

Within the last several years the argument has
become largely one between the professionals them-
selves, instead of between the laity and the profes-
sionals. For many years past the American societies
for physiology, pharmacology, biochemistry, pathology
and nutritionﬁwith membership running to several
thousand—have stood united in a Federation. It
Sponsors the publication of a Bulletin of the National
Society for Medical Research, the purpose of which is
to shelter and if possible to aid the vivisector in his
labors. By word and by picture it has quieted much
public hysteria, even as it has proved many times
over that the life of a dog or a cat within the walls
of a biological laboratory may not be altogether bad.

But does scientiﬁc curiosity at times overreach it-
self? This is what the late Dr. Robert Gesell, chief of
physiology in the Medical School of the University of

FOR JANUARY, 1955

Michigan for thirty years, claimed when, in recent
issues of the Report of the Animal Welfare Institute, he
addressed himself to the Federation on "abuses in ani-
mal experimentation.” His recitation of such abuses,
as found all over the world, made poor reading. It
was senseless, he said, to keep repeating experiments
about which we already knew the answer, just to
bolster the statistics of "career” scientists. Critics
fell upon him at once, charging him with being an
"antivivisectionist.” In truth, his brilliant contri-
butions to the physiology of breathing could never have
been made without vivisection. His objection was to
the methods pursued by some of the biological workers
because not always "humane”—even when excused
because "scientiﬁc.”

It is impossible to be a physiologist without being
a vivisector. As the anatomist cannot do without a
cadaver, so the physiologist cannot do without some
kind of the living stuff. But the novice in "experi-
mental medicine” should realize early that in its pro-
curement he is given broad choice.

The cry of the antivivisectionist is kept alive by
something very simple-here and there a dog or a
cat disappears into a medical school and does not
return! Avoid this embarrassment by not experi-
menting on dogs and cats. Rabbits and guinea pigs
are less known to the antivivisectionist; and he is
likely to hate snakes, rats and mice. If retort is made
that these subjects are anatomically too small to
allow of such surgery as recently showed the doctor
how to save the blue baby, then do as the Mayos did
and try a pig, a sheep or even a calf.

Although active all my life—speciﬁcally since 1897—
in the animal laboratories of half a dozen so-called
medical centres, no agent of any humane or any anti-
vivisectionist society ever bothered me, even though

subject to his inspection many
times. Oddly enough, the
only authority who did bother
me was one of the eight medi-
cal deans under whom I have
served in Cincinnati. He took
me to task because I accepted
credits in physiology brought
to me from a distant labora-
tory, even as the chief of that
laboratory would not accept
mine. The dean explained
that, in the Chicagoan’s opin-
ion, I "did not kill enough
dogs.” Ironically, my critic
was talking out of the very
laboratory into which, under
the chieftainship of Elias Pot-
ter Lyon, I had helped to
introduce a course intended
to repeat what are known as
the classic experiments of mam-
malian physiology. Observing that our picked students
had greater interest in the surgery they were about to
perform than in any principle of physiology they would
learn, we quickly discontinued it.

The immunity of the forty-year-old Joseph Eichberg
Laboratory for Physiology in the University of Cin-
cinnati to the antivivisectionist is easily explained.
It never used a dog or a eat when some other animal
would serve. When dogs and cats were used, they were
never experimented upon more than once; and quiet
and immediate death was assured the victims unless
survival was necessary for further observation. In
latter instance the animal was never allowed to suffer
more pain than that incident to a surgical endeavor
on man; and every survivor was to become a pensioner
of the laboratory.

From the ﬁrst, vivisectional operation was entrusted
only to the competent. By the sacriﬁce of just one
animal, the able individual can do for many students
what the incompetent cannot accomplish for the few
by the sacriﬁce of many. But mammalian physiology
is most quickly learned when the medical student is
Ordered to operate upon himself. The nebulous be-
comes real when he aspirates blood out of his own vein,
swallows a stomach tube, tries breathing into a paper
sack, exhausts himself by a swift run around the block;
and even one day without food or water will rouse him
to better understanding of what is war or drought.

The antivivisectionist cannot object if you experi-
ment with plants instead of animals; aquatic animals
instead of the terrestrial. The total of the growth prob-
lem is contained in a seedling; what you do to hell-
benders, salamanders and carp rarely excites anybody;
and nobody cares how you treat aphids or a smut.

Most antivivisectionists stand arrested in their
crusade as soon as it is explained to them that the
purposes of vivisection are those of medical education

and the discovery of the better way in medicine for the
happier and longer life of all living things. When mere
argument does not carry, the objector may be wel-
comed into the laboratory and shown the quarters for
the animals. This will permit comparison with the
living quarters of much of the human race, not to men-
tion the domesticated animals. But even here the
structurally best may not be the best for the animal.
Tiled and vermin-proof housings atop a skyscraper still
smell more of the penitentiary than of the ﬁeld; all
animals long for a box set upon the ground with a
runway attached, wherefrom it is possible to look
upon the sky.

I have always belonged to the soft-shelled among
the vivisectors. This stand, I believe, exhibits my
intelligence. I believe, too, that only conscience can
settle the differences that arise between the vivi-
sector and the antivivisectionist. Properly informed,
the antivivisectionist usually gives up; but the vivi-
sector is too likely to keep on. Since the antivivi-
sectionists have never won their case in any court
—not even in England—the vivisectors have tried
further to strengthen their position in law. To this
end they have devised "seizure” laws under which
government agencies are called upon to turn over
to our "medical” research institutes any demanded
number of impounded dogs and cats. It is the stupid
way of getting what you need, for the greatest of animal
lovers will bestow his pet upon you when you explain
to him that the animal will die for a great cause.
This attitude delivered to the Army all the dogs it
wished, to train them to carry bombs into the enemy’s
trenches. It blew up the enemy—but also the dog.

Even when the antivivisectionist secures his case,
his victory is small, for suffering carries not only
the factor of intensity but of extensity. The
number of animals sacriﬁced for medical teaching

 




and research is as nothing compared
with the thousands sacriﬁced for man’s
food needs every day. Regard the
precedent brandings, breakings and cas-
trations of the animals of our ﬁelds; their
inadequate shelter, food and transport;
their death on the abattoir ﬂoor. If you
have never visited the source of your
steaks, chops and bacon, by all means
do so. It could make you into an East
Indian.

Thus it comes about that even a small
improvement in breeding and butchering
practices does vastly more to reduce the
total of animal suffering than any periodic
raid on the medical laboratory. What
has been called the greatest forward move—
ment in the prevention of cruelty to ani-
mals came to public notice in 1952 when
the George A. Hormel Packing Plant in
Austin, Minnesota, determined to anesthe-
tize its animals before killing them. It
is done by the simple trick of running
the hogs through a chamber of carbonic
acid gas, in which way ten thousand daily
go to sleep. This eliminates the fear of
the runway and the pain of the sticking
process; even as the efficiency of the

butcher is enhanced by being given opera—
tion upon a quiet instead of a struggling
hog suspended from a chain by a back
leg. It has been claimed that precedent

pain and fear affect the taste of meat.
This item obviously is now controlled;
and legs are no longer broken and hams
bruised. It costs less to kill an animal
in this humane fashion than it costs to
do it in the customary; and it is more
than a commercial plug when those who
must eat meat—and those who can think
—-are asked to specify “Hormel.”

Man has conquered the living world
because he has learned the art of domesti-
cation, not only of himself but of many
other animal forms. But is his prowess
j ustiﬁedi’ It was in pioneer days and when
man was seeking to live against a hostile
world. But is it now? One of my con-
scientious friends is against the hunting
of quail. Why will he then eat chicken,
its close relative? His answer is simple——
the quail works to live; the chicken only
loafs. While the wild bird must ﬁght
eternally to gain subsistence, the barn-
yard bird, like the human “gold—digger,”
needs only to walk to the trough, keep
breathing, and eat and swallow. It is
not pure humor when our friends of the
wild seek government aid to declare our
ground fowl songbirds, so to shield them
from the hunter.

It is not likely that any vivisector will
ever be convicted so long as the public
knows the blessings vivisection has brought

to the living world. Because of Claude
Bernard, for example, we know the why
of the ﬂush, the why of the tear and the
why of sugar in the urine. Through his
experiments on frogs he invented the
drug-testing techniques of today which
allow us to know what a medicament will
do before it is risked upon a patient.
(Upon his death, his daughter threw all
her energies and all her capital into the
antivivisection cause!) Because of Pavlov
we know of the bridge between the body
and the “psyche.” Because of Cannon
we know that no animal in pain, forgotten,
caged, hungry or in fear reacts “normally.”

How to manage a physiological labora-
tory is exhibited in Gustav Eckstein’s
reports on his animals (Lives, Canary,
Everyday Miracle). His many canaries
have always flown free, some of them
living to be more than twenty years old.
Pigeons prefer his working laboratory to
the outside; the parrots are attached to
him as persons; the turtles come to him
to be buried for the winter. His cats have
lived for years in common quarter with
mice and rats-neither practicing canni-
balism because adequately fed.

There comes great reward in biological
discovery to the animal experimenter who
understands Steinbeck’s line: “Be kind
to little dogs, you dirty man!”

eral. practitioners.
Salk‘s Work

Dr. Jonas E. Salk. developer
of the Salk anti-polio vaccine
now under test. is working on an
immunity test. His test would
use. only a drop of blood taken
from the finger tip, but would
require the use of live animal
tissue in the laboratory. It re—
quires several months and is ex-
pensive because of the necessity
of obtaining and caring for
monkeys.

The Lipton-Steigman test, its
inventors believe. can determine
whether any person is immune
to any one or all three of the
polio viruses. If the Salk vac-
cine immunization method
proves effective against polio,
the new test might be useful to
determine. ﬁrst. whether any
child, needs the vaccine and
second. whether the vaccination
has “taken.”

The new system depends on
the use of hela cells. a type of
cancer cell which is grown in. a
test tube. The hela cells are
placed in a battery of test tubes.
They are mixed with polio virus
of each strain. and then mixed
in varying but speciﬁc amounts
of blood serum from, the person
being tested. About a spoonful
of blood is needed. taken from
the arm.

At the end of a week or eight
days, the tubes are examined for
color. If there is protection
against polio in the blood. the
mixture turns yellow; if not.
the mixture retains its red color.
The color test shows not only if
the person is immune but to
what degree he is immune to
eachtype of polio.

There is a good chance the
method also can be used to test
:for immunity against other vi—
ruses besides polio. Further tests
will be needed to determine this.

Blood samples with which the
research was carried out were

All but forgotten in the furor
over the Salk vaccine is one con~
tender as the ultimate protection
against po-liomyelitis. It is still
ivory much alive in numerous
laboratories. It is the live polio
virus vaccine.

  

This kind of vaccine has a long
ancestry going back to the ﬁrst

Little Daggers

Apparently the human or ani-

infection with a terriﬁc burst of
gin'imunity—producing chemicals.
’These chemicals are known as
antibodies, and. released in

iviruses.

formaldehyde. The dead virus
can no longer give the disease
but it still can. stimulate the
body to create the antibodies,
the virus sheaths.

Another answer is to so
weaken. the disease—producing
propensities of the viruses that
they cannot kill or paralyze. Dr.
Jenner found a naturally weak
variation of sins llpox virus-nthe

cinia. ' .

After many generaons
in'wﬁi’nice, the yellow fever

it as a vaccine.

Now, Dr. Hillary Koprowski,
of Lederle Laboratories, Pearl
River, N. Y., and others have
used the mice to produce weak
polio viruses of two types. Dr.
Koprowski fed this virus to
fourteen children five years ago.
They were not paralyzed and
they are still immune.

Dr. Albert Sabin. of the Uni—
versity of Cincinnati. has used
another technique to produce

the body to be always ready to.
produce antibodies. There is no
final proof of this contention.

On the other hand, dead virus
vaccine is difficult to make. It.
must be free of live virus, it must '
be free of other germs becausej
it is. injected, and it is hard to,
test it for freedom from live;
virus and alien chemicals.

How to Prove It?

Because it is difficult to makef
it is expensrwve Also aided to‘:
the cost is the pr ice of the lar go 1
amount of live virus needed irr-
the first place. Enough dead'
material must be injected to get
a stimulating effect The safety
tests with eighteen monkeys per
batch add to the expense.

"7qu are the “writs and draws
backs of the live rims vaccine?

The live virus also is sa o, it
proper lv weakened The point 7
is to prove it. There is always
the possibility that the weakened
virus. by changing. may become
disease-bent again. Not only
could it infect the individual but
also the-immediate members of
his family, for the polio-stricken
person eliminates virus in his
stool.

So far this reverting has not
occurred in the 100 or so patients
tried by Drs. Koprowski and
Sabin in their separate experi-
ments. They need about 1,000
to clinch this point.

Another advantage is that live
virus vaccines are known to give
longtime immunities.

   
        
          
           
       
         
         
   
      
      
          
       
    
      
  
 
     
         
         
     
 
      
      
       
           
       
             
        

      
       
       
       
    
        
        
        
     
     
     
     
     
     
       
 
     
      
     
     
     
     
     
      
  
   
  

It‘s Cheaper
This ’ vaccine is eaten and
therefore need not be sterile
like the dead virus vaccine.
Along with the need for fewer
viruses. this makes the live
virus vaccine cheaper to manu~
facture, although similar safety

tests must be employed.
But the dead virus vaccine has
a long step out front. It has
been mass tested and soon will
be given to trillions of children
who will acquire some degree of

immunity. This will make it
difficult for the live vaccine ad~

vocates to test their products
unless they go abroad.
Eventually the vaccine
men believe they will be able to
introduce their material by ﬁrst
injecting dead Virus and then
giving the live virus as a booster,

live

remains.
