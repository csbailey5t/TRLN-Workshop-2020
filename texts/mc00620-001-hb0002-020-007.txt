Natural History Museum, where" they are well-stuffed, and in New York,
where they are even better displayed. The miserable and mangy creat 1’res
who travel about the country in narrow and often stinking Cages, performing
in c1 "crises, are caricatures of the beasts of nature and the victims of a sordid
and senseless trade, which We could and would stop 27‘ we [00/6 #12 27025516

Here are a few of the things that happen in circuses, given. in evidence
before the Select Committee of the House of Commons: —-~

(61) Dogs have been kicked and thrashed unmercifully to make them
jump from a height.

((1) A bear was continually beaten on the snout, for months 'on end, in
order to “ make it know its master. "

(5) Dog whips have been found with a spike, like a sail—needle, hidden
under the ribbons.

(d) Monkeys are sometimes made to wear oneor even two suits of,
waterproof clothing under their amusing outer garments, in order that the
public shall not see certain symptoms of terror to which these animals are/1
liable While gor 11g through their performances

it would be possible to make a long catalogue of horrors that have
been perpetrated at one time or an other, but if even one of these things were
done oc‘asio1ailv (the truth is that there are worse miseries, unprintable)
s nely that we ild be reason enough to kee ep ourselves, and our children, from
shows so tainted with senseless cruelty? A common assumption is that
anirn rls are Genera: v trained by kindness. That is a dangerous half— truth i.
Hots es will pose as stat 1es» dogs will dive elephants will pirouette on tubs,
and bears ride bicycles, enjoying these things if done occasionally, as a
household net does its tricks. But tle _e is a wide difference, as most of us
know, between the amateur and the professional. lo perform tricks twice
or three times a day, regularly, at the right instant, to the crack of the

rar ner s whip, or ot herwise g1v1 11g instant obedience to his signal, involves
efi 1111 cruelty A human performer may go through his turn with an
aching heart, but he is paid for it, and can change his occupation.

An animal isn’t and can’t He represents unpaid, swe ated labour.

V/ith heavy slaughter and much suffering (both on the spot and during
he journey) we stock the menageries of Europe and America. Then some-
times by kindness and sometimes by hideous cruelty, the animals are taught.
a feV w stupid tricks. Finally you and I pay to see these down/1:624:75 and
trainers (they are generally foreigners) driving. goading, or perhaps only
tempting their charges through their imbecile routine. And whatever
happens0 on the stage, you may the sure if the animals fail to give satisfaction
they will be punished behind the scenes.

There may be two opinions about some humanitarian activities I do
not think I am “ orthodox ” myself. But I see no shadow of argument in
favour of animal turns at circuses. Children prefer clowns, conjurors,
acrobats; If any adult enjoys a wild beast show after reading how it is
"sometimes produced, and after considering for a moment how difﬁcthiﬁu
must be to detect cruelty, he or she is past praying for. .
